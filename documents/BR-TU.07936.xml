ABSTRACT 

Lino, L.M., 2018, Geometry and stratigraphy of Limeira intrusion (SP-Brazil) [Master’s 

Thesis], São Paulo, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade de São Paulo, 85p. 

The Limeira Intrusion is an occurrence related to the Mesozoic continental flood basalts of 

Paraná Magmatic Province, cropping out at the eastern São Paulo state. It is made up of basic-

intermediate rocks with a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal compositions, related 

to the specific evolutionary process in a magma chamber. 2D forward modeling of 

magnetometric data, based on available aerial and newly obtained ground data integrated with 

in situ rock magnetic susceptibility measurements, were used to establish its geometry. The 

results, even considering intrinsic drawbacks of magnetometric theoretical models, are 

compatible with the geologic-based presumed intrusion geometry. In addition, the stratigraphic 

analysis of compositional and textural variations, coupled with the structural and geometric 

features, allowed the interpretation of its emplacement mechanism and thermal evolution. 

Quantitative textural analysis through crystal size distribution (CSD) of plagioclase crystals, 

the spatial distribution pattern of structures, microtextures, granulation, and rock-types, 

evidenced the internal heterogeneities of this occurrence. An approximately 110 m top-to-floor 

exposure section reveals that its internal heterogeneity was caused by non-instantaneous 

successive emplacement of three different magma injections. The textural analysis also reveals 

fine-grained crystals formed under different cooling paths, present in medium- to coarse-

grained rocks within the intrusion, next to sharp contacts between different rock compositions. 

The contacts between different rocks are characterized by hybridization textures and by 

significant amounts of plumose granophyre-type and plumose plagioclase. The time lapse 

between consecutive pulses is responsible for a stepwise cooling-path, preservation of 

hybridization textures, and the development of almost rigid surfaces providing crystals 

alignment during magma flow. High-resolution Sr-isotopy data demonstrates a complex 

assembly history, possibly involving filter pressing of residual liquids, and pre-existent crystals 

before magma installation in coarse-grained rocks. It is also possible to recognize fewer 

amounts of country-rocks assimilation, which decreases towards the intrusion’s core and can 

be associated with magma migration due to filter pressing processes. In the feeder zone, the 

evolution of emplacement was marked by an almost continuous decrease in wall-rock 

assimilation by the consecutive magma batches.

RESUMO 

Lino, L.M., 2018, Geometria e estratigrafia da intrusão de Limeira (SP-Brasil) [Dissertação de 

Mestrado], São Paulo, Instituto de Geociências, Universidade de São Paulo, 85p. 

A intrusão de Limeira é uma ocorrência associada aos basaltos continentais Mesozoicos da 

Província Magmática do Paraná, aflorando na região leste do estado de São Paulo. Esta intrusão 

é composta por rochas básico-intermediárias que ocorrem com grande diversidade de 

estruturas, texturas e composições modais, relacionados aos mecanismos evolutivos específicos 

desta câmara. A modelagem magnetométrica bidimensional, baseado em aerolevantamentos 

disponíveis e dados recentes obtidos em campo e integrados às medidas de suscetibilidade 

magnética em rocha, foram utilizados para estabelecer sua geometria. Os resultados, mesmo 

considerando as desvantagens intrínsecas teóricas do método, são compatíveis com o modelo 

geológico presumido para esta intrusão. Adicionalmente, a análise das variações estratigráficas 

de composição e texturas, associados aos parâmetros estruturais e geológicos, permitiram a 

interpretação dos mecanismos de colocação e evolução térmica desta intrusão. Análises 

texturais quantitativas através da análise de distribuição de tamanho de cristais (DTC), a 

distribuição espacial de padrões estruturais, microtexturas, granulação e litotipos, evidenciam 

a heterogeneidade interna desta ocorrência. A seção de aproximadamente 110 metros de topo-

a-base revela que sua heterogeneidade interna foi causada pela injeção sucessiva de pelo menos 

três pulsos magmáticos. Através da análise textural foram reconhecidos cristais de plagioclásio 

de granulação muito fina a fina presentes em rochas de granulação média a grossa, formados 

em diferentes razões de resfriamento e próximo ao contato abrupto entre rochas de diferentes 

composições. Estes contatos caracterizam zonas onde são reconhecidas texturas híbridas e são 

marcados pela presença e abundância de intercrescimentos granofíricos do tipo plumoso e 

plagioclásios plumosos. O espaço de tempo entre pulsos magmáticos consecutivos é 

responsável pela evolução térmica em etapas nesta intrusão, preservando as texturas de 

hibridização, e desenvolvendo superfícies com rigidez suficiente para promover o alinhamento 

de cristais de plagioclásio por fluxo magmático. Análises isotópicas demonstram um processo 

de colocação complexo para este corpo, possivelmente envolvendo a filtragem por pressão dos 

líquidos residuais da cristalização dos pulsos iniciais, além da existência de ante-cristais 

formados antes da instalação das rochas de granulação grossa. Também é possível reconhecer 

o processo de assimilação de uma pequena parcela das rochas encaixantes, principalmente pelas 

rochas das bordas, que decai para o centro da intrusão e é marcado pela migração dos líquidos 

residuais. Na zona de alimentação, a evolução da colocação é marcada pela diminuição do 

processo de assimilação pelos pulsos seguintes.

CHAPTER I 

“If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more 

  to patient attention, than any other talent.” Sir Isaac Newton 

I.1. INTRODUCTION 

 The Limeira intrusion (SP-Brazil) is a basic-intermediate occurrence associated to the 

Paraná Magmatic Province (PMP), which crops out into two quarries (Cavinatto and Basalto 4) 

and provides a well top-to-bottom exposition of the intrusion-forming rock-types. These 

exposures allows to examine atypical features, rarely seen in other analogous intrusions, such 

as (1) the preservation of structural relationship with host-rocks at the uppermost contact, (2) 

expanded compositional variation, including since basaltic to rhyolitic rocks, as well as a 

significant late hydrothermal input, and (3) a significant variety of magmatic structures and 

textures. In this sense, Lino (2015) and Lino et al. (2018) draw attention to its compositional, 

structural and textural variability inwards, pointing in evidence a more complex emplacement- 

and magmatic-evolutionary model, rather than a single magma batch that evolved under the 

process of fractional crystallization, as it had been previously considered. Previous geological 

studies give some support for a lopolithic-like intrusion form (e.g., Lino, 2015), and coupled 

with the distribution of rock-types, structures, textures, and chemical compositions, these data 

are suggestive of a multiple stage emplacement. 

I.2. OBJECTIVES 

 Evolutionary magmatic models of intrusive occurrences are strictly dependent on their 

final volumes, geometry variations during the emplacement process, magmatic accretionary 

rates, initial compositions, volatile content, and magma initial temperature. Even representing 

important information to the modeling of the magmatic process, the geometry (volume) and 

emplacement mechanisms of igneous intrusions are still a subject of interest. Due to its small 

size and volume, as well as the singular mode of exposure, the Limeira intrusion becomes a 

preferential object of study when dealing with geometry and emplacement models, among the 

regional igneous intrusions from the Paraná Magmatic Province. The main objectives of this 

research were to determine the main geometric features of Limeira intrusion through 

geophysical modeling, as well as to establish its internal stratigraphy and petrographic facies 

distribution in detail, providing a better background for the analysis of emplacement 

mechanisms and the magmatic evolution of this magma chamber. The achievement of these 



2 

 

objectives was sectioned into two steps to simplify the approach, resulting in the principal 

sections of this dissertation, presented as scientific papers. Specifically, the main research aims 

were: 

? Characterization of Limeira intrusion geometry, based on geophysical magnetometric 

modeling; 

? Detailed characterization of the basic-intermediate rocks petrographic properties to 

properly classify the occurring rock-types, as well as to define the internal stratigraphy 

of the intrusion; 

? Characterization of the main structural patterns and quantification of the main micro-

textural variation within this magma chamber; 

? Quantification of the grain-size distribution (CSD) and spatial distribution patterns 

(SDP) of plagioclase crystals; 

? The proposition of compatible models for emplacement, magmatic and thermal 

evolution of the intrusion. 

I.3. PRESENTATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE DISSERTATION 

 The present dissertation results of a multidisciplinary approach applied to model the 

geometric features as well as the emplacement mechanisms of Limeira intrusion. In this sense, 

it is presented a geophysical 2-D modeling based on ground- and aerial-magnetometric 

measurements, combined with quantitative textural analysis and geological aspects that put in 

relief the main internal heterogeneities of the intrusion. This dissertation is constituted of five 

chapters, among them, two are presented in the form of scientific papers. The current Chapter 

(I) introduces the main topic and presents the aims of this work. Chapter II details the scientific 

approach and the methods carried out to achieve the research objectives. The Chapters III and 

IV present scientific manuscripts. The first, published in the Brazilian Journal of Geology, deals 

with magnetometric analysis, 2-D modeling and their results, while the second deals with 

micro-textural analysis, stratigraphy, and inferences on the emplacement and thermal evolution 

models, and is in final reviewing process to be submitted to an international journal. These 

chapters describe in some detail the intrusion regional setting and previous work, in this sense 

they will not be repeated in this introduction. The last Chapter (V) summarizes, integrates and 

discusses the obtained results.

CHAPTER II 

“No great discovery was ever made 

without a bold guess” Sir Isaac Newton 

II.1. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 In this research, the scientific approach followed classical methods applied for the 

investigation of intrusive igneous rocks, based mainly on previous geological and petrographic 

results presented by Lino (2015). In short, geophysical surveys were carried out in the Cavinatto 

quarry and surrounds, considering the occurrence area of Limeira intrusion, as delimited by 

Seixas et al. (2015). Both magnetometric and some gravimetric data were obtained. At this step, 

rock-type classification followed those proposed by Faria (2008) and Lino (2015). 

 After concluding the geophysical modeling, classical detailed geological and 

petrographical facies (Ulbrich et al., 2001) mapping were conducted, followed by petrographic 

compositional and textural descriptions, quantitative textural analysis, and in situ plagioclase 

isotopic measurements. Whole-rock and mineral chemical analysis, including in situ 

plagioclase trace elements, were also obtained and considered during the research. They will 

be presented elsewhere (Lino &amp;amp; Vlach, in preparation), and are not considered in this 

dissertation. The laboratory work was performed mainly at the GeoAnalitica core facility, from 

the IGc-USP. The Sr-isotope and trace elements analysis were carried out at the MITERAC 

(USA), conducted by MSc. Maria Isabel G. Arroyave. 

 A somewhat more detailed description of the applied methods is given in chronological 

sequence, as follows: 

II.1.1. Geophysical data acquisition and treatments 

 Total magnetic field (TMF) measurements were performed with two Proton Precession 

Overhauser Magnetometers (Gem System, models GSM-19), with coupled high-precision GPS 

systems, in 516 field stations listed in the Appendix A. One of them was used for diurnal 

variation measurements on a fixed station far from potential anthropogenic influence, while the 

other was used as the rover station. The average distance between two successive measurement 

stations was about 30 m (Figure 1). 

 Magnetic susceptibility (MS) data were obtained for 57 rock samples. The 

measurements were made on regular surfaces or slices of fresh hand samples with portable 

equipment from GF Instruments. On the average, ten measurements were taken on each sample. 

In the studied rocks, the MS values are directly correlated with the magnetite/Ti-magnetite 

modal content.

 Data processing and treatment procedures are summarized in Figure 2 (see also 

Cavallaro, 2013 and Milsom, 2003). The TMF values, registered on the base and rover stations, 

were imported into the Geosoft´s Oasis Montaj® software and corrected for the diurnal 

magnetic variations and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field, IGRF 

(http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/geomag/jsp/IGRF.jsp, accessed in May 2017)

localization of Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries, spaced about 800 meters. Dotted lines represent measurement 

stations, and SP-330 is the Anhanguera Highway.

in this work. See text for more details. 

 The final processing steps included data interpolation by the minimum curvature (MC) 

method (Briggs, 1974), analytical signal amplitude (ASA) filtering and the reduction to pole 

(RTP) systematics. The RTP systematics followed suggestions set out by Phillips (2007), 

considering the frequency domain, to highlight the main features and generate geophysical

maps. The available aeromagnetometric data (CPRM, Rio-São Paulo Project 1039, carried out 

150 m high) was similarly treated in order to provide a comparison and better interpretation. 

 The ASA filter may be used to detect the main edges and geometric features of 

geological occurrences with significant magnetic contrast (e.g., Nabighian, 1972). With this 

procedure, the horizontal and vertical gradients of the detected anomalous potential field 

normally form a maximum and minimum pair of analytical signals; the former depicts the 

edges, while the latter highlights the center of the involved occurrences (Nabighian, 1984). 

 In the case of 3D analysis, the ASA filter - which represents a horizontal plane – depends 

on the inclination and declination directions of the target’s magnetization and the geomagnetic 

field; therefore the filter can be applied for edge estimation under some specific conditions (Li, 

2006). In this way, the ASA maximum is located over the causative body’s edge only when it 

occurs at shallow deeps and can migrate with increasing depths to the center of the targets. 

According to the author, ASA filter works well for edge-detection, considering a prismatic 

model, when the ratio between the body top depth and its width is less than 0.1. 

 Based on synthetics models, Ferreira et al. (2013) have shown that the ASA filter 

effectively depicts up the edges of geological occurrences with a constant thickness. The 

authors have also demonstrated different methods for edge detection, based mainly on 

directional derivatives. The ASA filter is defined by the following equation 1, where M is total 

magnetic anomalous field, and x, y, and z represents three-dimensional directions in the space.

 The RTP systematics (Baranov, 1957) was applied to recalculate data intensity as well 

as to transpose the magnetic anomalous field (MAF) onto the geomagnetic pole reference, 

where the induced magnetization is in the vertical position. If the total magnetization direction 

is known (Kearey &amp;amp; Brooks, 2002), it turns the induction polarization independent of the 

direction of the geomagnetic field (Telford et al., 1976), by transforming the dipolar anomaly 

into a monopolar one (e.g., Baranov, 1957; Nabighian, 1972, 1984). In the frequency domain, 

the RTP systematics is defined by the following equation 2, where I is the magnetic inclination; 

D is magnetic declination, and Ia Is a correction parameter for the amplitude.

 The remnant magnetization affects the interpretation of magnetic anomalies and 

generates misinterpretation concerning targets shape and size (e.g., Cordani &amp;amp; Shukowski, 

2009). The South Atlantic Anomaly (Hartmann &amp;amp; Pacca, 2009), characterized by low magnetic 

intensities in southern America, results in a natural remnant magnetization more important than 

the induced one. Thus, the theoretical response may be not compatible with the observed 

anomaly. The available paleomagnetic data (Ernesto et al., 1999) was used to correct, through 

conventional vectorial sum, the inclination and declination directions of the total magnetization. 

The reference values used as well as the resulting total magnetization vector are summarized in 

Table 1, where the remnant (Jr) and induced (Ji) magnetizations can be expressed as the 

Königsberger ratio (Q = Jr/Ji).

computed total magnetization vector.

2-D forward magnetic modeling was conducted from total anomaly profiles, exported 

from Geosoft, using the GRAVMAG software (Pedley et al., 1997). This software allows 

constructing polygons with different forms and magnetic susceptibilities using measured data 

profiles to create a theoretical anomaly, which could be successively refined to a best possible 

solution. In this sense, a previous good geological framework is necessary to build any magnetic 

coherent models (Pedley et al., 1997). 

II.1.2. Sampling and field work 

 After a previous detailed geologic and petrographic characterization, we conducted a 

systematic sampling of the main rock varieties within the Cavinatto quarry, considering modal 

compositions, structures, textures, as well as the stratigraphic level. About 80 oriented samples, 

precisely located with the aid of portable GPS and barometer, were collected for this work, 

among them, 30 were considered for detailed petrographic analysis. The localization of each 

sample within Cavinatto quarry are listed in the Appendix B. The orientation of ruptile 

structures and rock-contacts were measured using a conventional compass. 

II.1.3. Modal measurements 

 Conventional modal measurements were carried out over polished thin sections, by 

point counting (Chayes, 1965), considering square grids with 2,000 points spaced by 0.2 mm 



7 

 

for the fine-grained varieties, and 2,500 points spaced by 0.3 to 0.4 mm for medium- and coarse-

grained ones, respectively, over an area close to total thin-section. The associated standard 

deviations were estimated from 4-5 coining blocks, constituted by 500 points each. 

 Due to the occurrence of contrasting granophyre-types (intergrowths of K-feldspar and 

quartz) within and among samples, and considering that they can qualitatively record different 

cooling-rates during the late magmatic stage (Barker, 1970; Smith, 1974), we also attempted to 

quantify their diversity. Four main granophyre-types, occurring as isolated mesostasis between 

plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals (i.e. Figure 3a), are present in our samples and can be 

classified as: (1) plumose-, (2) radial-fringe, (3) vermicular-, and (4) cuneiform-types (Figure 

3b), indicating an increase in residence time, respectively. In each sample, 500 points on 

average were counted, spaced by 0.1 mm over the granophyre areas. The relative modal 

abundance of quartz and alkali-feldspar were measured for the cuneiform granophyre-type 

intergrowth in four selected samples over optical microscopic images of ideal sections, resulting 

in an average of 47% (± 2 %) of quartz, and 53% (± 2 %) of alkali-feldspar. 

II.1.4. Textural analysis rationale, data acquisition, and treatment 

 Plagioclase CSD analysis was conducted for 17 selected samples, from the edge to the 

core of the intrusion. Crystals were drawn with the aid of Inkscape software, which allows 

obtaining vectorized images (Figure 3c, d). Samples with granulation up to 4.0 mm were 

photographed under a 5-fold magnification petrographic microscope, under both plane 

polarized and cross-polarizer lights. Additionally, photomosaic and high-resolution scanned 

images were also produced. Therefore, in order to generate reproducible CSD, at least ~200 

crystals are sufficient and were counted for coarse-grained samples and at least ~300 crystals 

for fine-grained ones (Mock &amp;amp; Jerram, 2005; Gualda, 2006). Volumetric proportion of 

plagioclase crystals were determined using CSD results and then compared to modal obtained 

data, which resulted in maximum errors of ±0.5% (one sigma). For most samples, there was no 

distinguishable fabric, except for the sample LIM-02, which was considered during 

stereological corrections. 

 The treatment of ready-made images was made using the Image-J software (Abramoff 

et al., 2004), to analyze crystals' shape and size distribution. It results in each location of the 

crystal’s centroid, the area of each crystal, orientation angle of the major axis in relation to the 

horizontal, and size of the major and minor axes of the adjustment ellipse - with equal area. 

Analyzed particles had sizes larger than 10 pixels, and the results were exported in CSD format. 

The stereological correction processes were performed using the CSD slice spreadsheet, to 



8 

 

estimate the best plagioclase crystals 3-D shape (Morgan &amp;amp; Jerram, 2006), and CSD-

Corrections v 1.55 software was used to calculate CSD lines. In the next section, we briefly 

describe some important aspects of the CSD theory and the methods for the determination of 

crystals spatial distribution patterns and alignment.

quartz, according to Smith (1974). b) Granophyre-types intergrowths occurring as mesostasis, interstitial to

spaced, about 1 pixel of distance, before quantitative distribution analysis.   

II.1.4.1. Principles of CSD theory  

 Marsh (1988) and Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh (1988) introduced and validated the Crystal Size 

Distribution (CSD) theory for a steady-state magmatic system based on previous work by 

Randolph &amp;amp; Larsen (1971), which demonstrate the constant relation between crystal growth-

rate and crystallization time in industrial crystal production processes. In short, there is a linear 

correlation between the natural logarithm of the crystal population density at a given crystal 

size (L) of a mineral phase and the correspondent size, as described by the following equation 

3 (Marsh, 1988). 



9 

 

    ln(?) = ln(?0) ? (
1

??
) ?                                                   (3) 

where n is the population density of crystals in a given size ?, ?0 is the final nucleation density 

(at ? =  0), ? is the effective growth rate (=  ??/??), and ? the effective residence time or 

crystallization interval. The parameter ?? is intrinsic to the system, and corresponds to ???, the 

mean (or characteristic) length of crystals, considering since zero to infinite ? values in a 

straight CSD distribution pattern. The nucleation rate of crystals (J) depends on the final 

nucleation density and the growth rate; it increases exponentially over time and is given by ? =

(??(?0))?. The CSD line slope ? =  ?1/??  (= ?1/???) is inversely proportional to growth rate 

and residence time of crystals. 

 The CSD model allows predicting dispersions from any of these parameters operating 

during magma crystallization (Marsh, 1998; Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh, 2002). Typical examples are 

illustrated in Figure 4, which highlights the effects over the standard model caused by 

increasing nucleation density and residence time. The evolving paths of real magmatic 

chambers are more complex as compared with the predicted by the steady-state CDS theory, 

and the log-linear crystal size patterns are affected by changes in cooling- and growth-rates, as 

well as crystal fractionation or mixing (Marsh, 1988; Burkhart et al., 1980; Marsh, 1998). For 

instance, CSD line inflections, as represented in Figure 4d, could indicate system reheating 

through the emplacement of a new magma batch, leading to more than one cooling stage, or 

magma mixing (Marsh, 1988; Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh, 1988; Jerram et al. 2003).

nucleation density and crystallinity under constant residence time. Note the formation of a convex-upwards hump, 

associated with the processes of “coarsening” at the crystallization final stages. c) Increasing residence time 

considering the same final nucleation density. The same effect might occur coupled with a decrease in final-

nucleation density. d) CSD line patterns after increasing nucleation rate due to an increase on the cooling rate, or

II.1.4.2. Spatial distribution patterns (SDP) 

 As CSD’s are related to the crystallization parameters of a magmatic system, the spatial 

distribution patterns (SDP) and the shape preferred orientation (SPO) of crystals reflect physical 

mechanisms acting during magma emplacement and crystallization (e.g., Jerram &amp;amp; Cheadle, 

2000). Jerram et al. (1996) developed a technique for determining the SDP parameter through 

the cluster analysis, considering the relationship between crystal’s centroid positions based on 

the R-values, given by: 

? =
??

??
=  

1

?
??

???

                                                        (4) 

where ?? and ??  are the ratios between the average nearest-neighbors in the sample and  that 

expected for a random distribution with a same population density respectively; N is the number 

of crystal centroids, r the distance to the nearest neighbor, and NA the number of crystals per 

unit area in the random pattern. Accordantly, R-values =1, &amp;lt;1 and &gt; 1 indicates random, 

clustered and ordered point distributions, respectively. By calculating R-values from 2-D 

sections of 3-D random distributions of spheres with variable porosities, the authors were able 

to define a Random Sphere Distribution Line (RSDL), which allows identify real clustered and 

ordered crystal distribution patterns in real rock frameworks. 

 Cluster analysis can also be applied to quantify the packing process during the 

crystallization of igneous rocks, and regions characterized by touching- and non-touching 

frameworks can be delimited in R-value vs. melt vol.% (or porosity vol.%) plots (Jerram et al., 

2003). As shown by Boorman et al. (2004), typical vectors for cluster variations trends expected 

from deformational compaction, overgrowth, and mechanical compaction processes can also 

be drawn in such plots. 

II.1.4.3. Shape preferred orientation (SPO) of crystals  

 Crystal orientation in igneous rocks results from magmatic plastic deformation in a 

laminar flux when the magma underwent a simple-, hyperbolic-, or a pure-shear flow (Turcotte 

et al., 1987; Fialko &amp;amp; Rubin, 1999; Higgns, 2006). The orientation ability depends on crystal 

shape and size, where no-equant crystals shapes register more efficiently shear directions (Iezzi 

&amp;amp; Ventura 2002). The calculation of a mean orientation angle is a widespread routine used to 

estimate the preferred alignment direction of crystals (Capaccioni et al., 1997); however, this 

procedure does not yield information about data dispersion. The length of the orientation vector, 

obtained through the following equation 5, adds significance of mean angle orientation and can 



11 

 

be tested in statistical tables (Swan &amp;amp; Sandilands, 1995). Resultant vectors greater than 0.244, 

for a 95% significance and n&gt;50, can indicate a preferred orientation (Davis, 1986). As 

demonstrated by Mock et al. (2003), the vector-length can validate the results of the mean 

orientation angles when its values are greater than the threshold.  

??? =
1

?
?(? sin ?? )

2 + (? cos ?? )
2                                              (5) 

 In the case of a more complex stratigraphic distribution, the crystals might present a 

slight dispersion in orientation. The variation of the vector-length is not linear, making difficult 

the direct comparison of orientation results. In order to compare the alignment results through 

a linear function, the former component can also be determined using the cosine-tensor 

direction (T), associated to its first eigenvector (Launeau &amp;amp; Cruden, 1998). The direction of the 

cosine-tensor can be calculated by equation 6, where n is the number of crystals and ? is the 

orientation angle. 

? =

? sin(?? ) cos(?? ) ? cos(?? )
2

|                                       (6) 

 Through this approach, the orientation dispersion is calculated from eigenvectors e1 and 

e2, in which a random distribution results in e1=e2=0.5, and a perfect alignment results in e1=1 

and e2=0. From eigenvectors is possible to derivate the axes of orientation of the ellipse ratio 

as ? = ??1/?2, varying from one in massive rocks, to zero in perfectly foliated rocks. It is also 

possible to calculate the Alignment Factor (AF), as AF=2(?1 ? 0.5), with results ranging from 

0 to 1 (alternatively ranging from 0 to 100) for massive to completely foliated rocks.

II.1.5. Sr isotope ratios in plagioclase and ICSD plots 

 Sr isotope analysis of plagioclase was performed by a Multi-Collector Inductively 

Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, with Laser Ablation sampling (LA-MC-ICP-MS) at the 

Mid West Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC), from the 

University of Notre Dame - the USA. In situ analysis was carried out over thick (ca. 60 ?m) 

polished sections from three samples, representative of three main stratigraphic levels. 

Measurements were made using a 150µm diameter laser beam and time to ablation of 60 

seconds. Analytical conditions for measurements were conducted with the following set up, 

Irradiance: 1.49 GW/cm3, Fluence: 4.46 J/cm3, and Repetition rate: 5Hz. 

 The analytical strategy and interference corrections over the Sr and Rb isotopes 

followed Ramos et al. (2004) and Paton et al. (2007). The isobaric interference of 87Rb over 

87Sr was corrected using 85Rb corrected signal intensities. A modern-day coral (MR) from the 

Indian Ocean (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70910?0.00003, ID-TIMS measurements, cf. Bizarro et al., 2003) 

was used as the main reference; the average 87Sr/86Sr on MR obtained during our analysis was 

0.70915?0.00007 (2?, N=30). 

 Initial 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios were computed considering 132 Ma. as the average age of 

the intrusion and then integrated with the obtained CSD data following the procedures described 

by Morgan et al. (2007) to drawn ICSD-type plots. The location of each analytical spot was 

calculated as a distance fraction from crystal core to rims and then normalized to the measured 

crystal-sizes. After stereological corrections, the deviations on spot positions were estimated as 

± 50% of the beam diameter.

2D MAGNETOMETRIC MODELING OF A BASIC-INTERMEDIATE INTRUSION 

GEOMETRY: GEOPHYSICAL AND GEOLOGICAL APPROACHES APPLIED TO 

THE LIMEIRA INTRUSION, PARANÁ MAGMATIC PROVINCE (SP, BRAZIL)

(DOI: 10.1590/2317-4889201820180099) 

 

ABSTRACT 

The Limeira Intrusion is an occurrence related to the Mesozoic continental flood basalts of 

Paraná Magmatic Province, cropping out at the eastern São Paulo state. It is made up of basic-

intermediate rocks with a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal compositions, related 

to specific evolutionary process in a magma chamber. Previous geological and stratigraphic 

evidence suggests it has a lopolithic-like geometry rather than a conventional sill-like, assumed 

for most regional similar occurrences. 2D forward modeling of magnetometric data, based on 

available aerial and newly obtained ground data integrated with in situ rock magnetic 

susceptibility measurements, were used to test such hypothesis. The results, even considering 

intrinsic drawbacks of magnetometric theoretical models, are compatible with the geologic-

based presumed intrusion geometry. The determination of intrusive bodies geometry is quite 

significant to explain their different emplacement mechanisms. In the case of Limeira intrusion, 

the results suggest that the emplacement mechanism may occur, apparently, by inner-accretion 

of fresh magmatic pulses in its central region. Importantly, the magmatic evolution of lopolith-

like basic-intermediate intrusions may open the way for extensive differentiation processes, 

with strong implications to petrology and metallogenesis.

III.1. INTRODUCTION 

 The formation and geometry of igneous intrusions in the crust are still a subject of debate 

in the literature due to the diverse forms of occurrence and to a great amount of tectonic 

environments in which they occur. However, recently the formation and growth of igneous 

intrusions have been associated to the amalgamation of several tabular-like intrusions (Menand, 

2011). The simplicity, larger distribution and relatively small volumes as compared with 

batholiths, turn tabular intrusions an object of preferential study when dealing with igneous 

bodies’ emplacement and thermal evolution.  

 Geophysical modeling is an important tool, which allows defining the geometry of 

several geologic occurrences. The magnetometric method, despite being a relatively more 

complex potential one, is a very efficient technique in the detection of geological occurrences 

with high magnetic susceptibility contrast in relation to their environments (e.g., Kearey &amp;amp; 

Brooks, 2002). 

 The magnetization intensity of a rock strongly depends on the modal volume and 

magnetic characteristics of its minerals. For instance, magnetic anomalies produced by a 200 

m3 body can be the same as those produced by a 2 km3 body, depending on its overall magnetic 

mineral content, while gravity anomalies are just related to density. This difference may lead to 

misinterpretation when dealing with magnetic anomalies; however, there are ways to 

circumvent this problem, based on well-designed previous geological models and the 

knowledge of the targets magnetic properties. 

 The continental crust presents internal stratification associated with variations of the 

constituting rocks physical properties, as so far indicated by geophysical data and theoretical 

models based on indirect observations. As well known, the crust is constituted, at least, by two 

main layers, a deep one composed of mafic rocks (lower crust), and a shallow one of granitic 

composition (upper crust) (e.g., Rudnick &amp;amp; Fountain, 1995). This type of stratification could 

not be explained by considering only the emplacement of vertical intrusions. In fact, available 

seismic data reveal the occurrence of intrusive complexes made up of tabular intrusions at the 

base of the continental crust, which could be likely mechanisms for the formation of different 

crustal layers (Franke, 1992). 

 The present work aims to provide geological and geophysical information about the 

geometry of Limeira Intrusion, a tabular-like occurrence related to the Mesozoic Paraná 

Magmatic Province (PMP), in southern Brazil. Although the province has been extensively 

studied concerning its stratigraphy, petrography, elemental and isotope geochemistry, and 

geochronology (e.g., Bellieni et al., 1984a; Ernesto &amp;amp; Pacca, 1988; Piccrillo &amp;amp; Melfi, 1988; 



15 

 

Peate, 1997; Gallagher and Hawkesworth, 1994; Nardy et al., 2003, and references therein), 

which allowed to draw several petrogenetic and tectonic models (e.g., Peate et al., 1992; Turner 

&amp;amp; Hawkesworth, 1995; Peate &amp;amp; Hawkesworth, 1996; Peate, 1997), there is still few detailed 

geological and stratigraphic research emphasizing the physical and geometric aspects of 

individual intrusions or lava flows. 

 Previous semi-detail geophysical studies by Seixas et al. (2015) showed that the Limeira 

Intrusion has a more limited lateral spreading than previously considered. In addition, previous 

geological studies give some support for a lopolithic-like intrusion form (e.g., Lino, 2015). 

Herein we present results obtained through a more detailed ground magnetometric survey, 

coupled with geological and rock magnetic susceptibility data. 

III.2. GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 

 The Paraná Magmatic Province (PMP), southern Brazil, represents the most important 

Mesozoic continental flood basalt expression, constituting the Serra Geral Formation, one of 

the uppermost formations of the Paraná Basin (Bryan &amp;amp; Ernst 2008; Milani 2004). Over 

562.000 km3 of lavas (Frank et al. 2009) were erupted in a time span between ca. 133 and 119 

Ma (Brückmann et al. 2014). 

 The majority of lavas are tholeiitic basalts, associated with minor andesites, riodacites 

and rhyolites, these later representing only ca. 3% of the lava flows and occurring mainly in the 

southern Paraná Basin area (Comin-Chiaramonti et al. 1988; Nardy et al. 2002). These lava 

flows comprise low-Ti geochemical types, which crop out in the base, while high-Ti varieties 

appear at the intermediate and the uppermost levels of lava sequences (Peate et al. 1992). 

 The origin of the PMP is certainly related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, 

through the process of lithospheric mantle melting under the influence of the Tristan da Cunha 

Plume (Peate et al. 1990; Hawkesworth et al. 1992; Turner &amp;amp; Hawkesworth 1995; Peate et al. 

1999; Marques et al. 1999) or, alternatively, to heat accumulation under the Pangea 

Supercontinent (Hartmann 2014).   

 In the eastern area of the São Paulo State, the high-Ti PMP magmatism is characterized 

by tabular-shaped intrusions, such as dikes, sills, and laccoliths (Zalán et al. 1986). Most dikes 

intrude basement rocks and form expressive dike swarms (Peate et al. 1992) while the 

emplacement of sub-horizontal tabular intrusions occurs mainly in sedimentary host 

discontinuities; estimated total thickness of such intrusions vary in general between 2 to 200 m 

but may reach up to 1,000 m (Marques &amp;amp; Ernesto 2004). 



16 

 

III.2.1.  Limeira Intrusion 

 The Limeira intrusion is one among several PMP intrusions that crop out in the São 

Paulo State central-eastern area (Figure 5). It intrudes Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, 

mainly sandstones and rhythmic siltstones, of the Itararé Subgroup (Faria 2008, Lino 2015). 

The best fresh-rock expositions are found in the so-called Cavinatto, owner’s family name, and 

Basalto 4 quarries. Soares (1985) was the first to recognize a huge intrusion at this region, 

named as the Limeira-Cosmópolis Sill. According to them, it would correspond to a tabular 

shaped intrusion, with almost 60 km of horizontal extension and 280 m of thickness, as 

suggested from surface evidence and available drill holes.

the pre-Cambrian basement, and location of the study area. Rocks of the Tubarão Supergroup (Itararé Subgroup) 

constitute most of the country rocks for the intrusions related to PMP magmatism. Simplified from Perrota &amp;amp; 

Salvador (2005). 

 Several recent works, emphasizing petrological, geochemical, stratigraphical and 

geophysical aspects, were conducted by Faria (2008), Oliveira &amp;amp; Dantas (2008), Lino (2015) 

and Seixas et al. (2015) among others, and highlighted some features relatively uncommon to 

other intrusion analogs. One of us, SRFV, had pointed out the occurrence of typical stratiform-



17 

 

like rocks at the medium- to deep-outcrops at the Cavinatto quarry, given by modal and textural 

centimetric- to decimetric-thick igneous layering. 

 The Limeira rock types include since aphanitic basalts and diabases, at the intrusion 

borders, coarse-grained monzodioritic to very coarse-grained quartz-monzodioritic rocks, 

inwards. Rhyolites/rhyodacites occur as late dikes, with mm- to cm-sized thickness, cutting 

across monzodiorites and diabases and as cm-sized ocelli in the upper diabases. 

 The main rocks are composed of plagioclase (An65-30), clinopyroxene (augite and 

pigeonite), Fe-Ti oxides (ilmenite, magnetite), and some sulfides. Apatite is the main accessory 

mineral. Well-developed granophyric intergrowths, composed by alkali-feldspar and quartz, are 

typical in the coarse-grained rocks mesostasis, amounting up to 23 % vol. Hydrothermal 

processes are evidenced by apophyllite-bearing late veins, interstitial low-temperature minerals 

precipitation, and substitution reactions affecting the primary mineral phases (Faria 2008; Lino 

2015).  

 Both Faria (2008) and Oliveira &amp;amp; Dantas (2008) noted the intrusion’s bottom edge 

exposed at the Basalto 4 quarry site and proposed that it becomes thinner to the southeast. Based 

on ground magnetometric survey and analytical signal amplitude profiles, Seixas et al. (2015) 

suggest that there are two independent intrusions in the Limeira area rather than a single sill: 

the first corresponds to the Limeira Intrusion itself, while the second (exposed at the 

Sertãozinho quarry) is another intrusion located in the southern area of Limeira city. 

III.2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

III.2.1. The geologic suggested model 

The Cavinatto quarry presents the best exposition of the Limeira Intrusion, currently 

exposing a vertical section with ca. 110 m deep in its southern and ca. 90m in the northern 

sides. The intrusion has a sub-horizontal roof, which becomes stepped towards the NW area. 

The exposed basic-intermediate rocks show a great diversity of structures, textures, and modal 

compositions. The most typical types may be grouped in aphanitic basalts, diabases, 

monzodiories, and quartz-monzodiorites. Petrographic and geochemical details of the main 

rock types, as well as chemical compositions of the rock-forming minerals details,  can be found 

in Faria (2008) and Lino (2015). A brief general characterization is presented in the following. 

The aphanitic varieties (1.0-1.3 m thick) probably accompany all intrusion contours. 

They are made of massive thin chilled margins in contact with thermally metamorphosed 

sedimentary rocks, and aphanitic basic rocks, which may show some hydrothermal alteration 

due to interaction with the H2O-bearing host rocks. As granulation increases progressively 



18 

 

inwards, the rock became a diabase, with a phaneritic texture and structures that change from 

amygdaloidal to massive inwards. The later crops out from ca. 1.3 m to ca. 20 m deep.  

Clinopyroxene monzodiorites occur from ca. 20 m to 60 m deep; their contacts with the 

overlaying diabases are usually sharp. They are very heterogeneous coarse-grained rocks, 

sometimes with a “jaguar-skin” aspect given by the irregular distribution of the mafic and felsic 

minerals. Felsic pods do contain typical granophyric intergrowths. Granulation increases 

downwards while the mafic content decreases. 

Clinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorites occur from ca. 60 m to 90 m deep; they are 

heterogeneous coarse- to very coarse-grained rocks with a cm-sized thin prismatic crystal of 

pyroxene, and well developed - sometimes platy - magnetite crystals, which imprints a grid-

like texture over a similar “jaguar-skin” aspect. Their contacts with the monzodiorites appear 

to be gradational. 

To the deepest levels exposed within the quarry, rock granulation decreases and 

compositions become again monzodioritic. These rocks are the ones characterized by rhythmic 

relatively mafic- and felsic-rich layers with subhorizontal dips. Importantly, they occur only on 

the eastern and southern quarry walls. 

The average SM values obtained for these rocks are presented in Table 3. The basic-

intermediate rocks present an average value about 44.5 x10-3 (SI), while the sedimentary host 

rocks show, as expected, a much lower one, about 0.219 x10-3 (SI). Among the formers, the 

aphanitic basalts, the monzodiorites, and the quartz-monzodiorites present also very contrasted 

averages values (from 80 to ~45 and 25 x10-3 SI, respectively), in accordance with their Ti-

magnetite/magnetite modal contents.

 The following field observations suggest a lopolith- rather than sill- or laccolith-like 

intrusion geometry as presented in Figure 6 (see also Lino, 2015): 



19 

 

1. part of northern contact with the enclosing siltstones is sub-vertical down to, at least 30-

40 m deep, as revealed by prospecting drill holes in country rocks; 

2. structural emplacement evidence observed along the intrusion suggest it thins towards 

the northwest, east, and southeast; 

3. the exposed layered sequences did not present the expected lateral distribution. They 

appear to constitute more or less concentric, localized, layers.

main rock-types, and the localization of the quarries. The figure illustrates the geometry of the intrusion based on 

the interpretation of field observations.  

III.2.2. Geophysical analysis 

 Geophysical results are presented as magnetic anomaly maps for ground and aerial 

surveys, and the final 2D forward modeling, as follows. 

III.2.2.1. Magnetic anomaly maps 

 The total magnetic anomaly maps are presented in Figure 7. They show similar positive 

and negative anomalies, as expected for targets located at this magnetic latitude - with 

predominant induced magnetization - pointing to a dipole over the Cavinatto and Basalto 4 

quarries, which defines the probable horizontal occurrence of the intrusion. The main observed 

differences between the ground- and aerial-based maps are the dipole layout, reflecting 

contrasted data acquisition systematics, and the anomalies intensities, which result from distinct 

vertical distances between the measurements and the target in each case. 

 



20 

 

 

Figure 7: Total anomalous magnetic field (nT) maps for the Limeira Intrusion based on our ground survey (i) and 

the available aerial data (ii). The locations of the Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries and the AB suggested geologic 

cross section (Figure 6) are indicated. Note the dipolar anomaly centered over the quarries in both maps and the 

difference range between the anomalous field intensities. 

 The derived analytical signal amplitude (ASA) maps are depicted in Figure 8. Of note, 

its application is valid in our case, with a favorable ratio between top depth (~20 m, based on 

field observations) and the expected width of Limeira intrusion (&gt;1,000 m, based on quarries 

location). So the use of both ground- and aerial-based maps, with different data distribution, 

allows to better delimit the possible limits of the intrusion. The terrestrial data presents better 

resolution and maximum ASA values twice as high as the aerial data due to the target proximity; 

on the other hand, the aerial data is cleaner from possible anthropic interferences. Their 

combination allows suggesting the intrusion limits quite well on the basis of the maximum 

signal, as depicted in Figure 8. 

 The RTP obtained maps (Figure 9) depict anomaly geometric features and their peek 

distributions, which are again similar in the ground- and aerial-based maps. In fact, they give 

the same response: two main high anomalies, aligned with the Cavinatto - Basalto 4 quarries 

tie line and a relative low anomaly between them. These lower values reflect, most probably, 

the lack of data over the area in both surveys. 

 In both cases, the positive anomaly is restricted to the most probable intrusion location. 

High anomaly variation gradients are observed close to the northern intrusion limits while 

relatively low gradients appear towards the southern limits. At first principles, the former 



21 

 

suggests a high dipping contact while the latter suggests a gradual lateral variation of the 

intrusion thickness.

survey (i) and the available aerial data (ii). Note that the ground data highlights two main regions with high ASA 

values, while aerial data (more defocused) presents an additional high ASA to southern, related the raw data 

acquisition contrasted features (white dots). The black dotted line in (i) is our best-estimated intrusion limits based 

on both maps.

total anomaly sections, extracted for the two-dimensional modeling. White dots represent the localization of data 

acquisition. 



22 

 

III.2.2.2. Magnetometric forward modeling 

 The RTP values derived from the ground survey were used to estimate the 2D intrusion 

geometry along the three main profiles shown in Figure 9. For simplicity and easiness of data 

treatment, this model considers an average value for the magnetic susceptibility [44.5 (10-3 SI)], 

which appears to not affect substantially the overall model. The AB profile runs along the 

unique geological section available, while the CD and EF profiles run along the regions with 

most ground magnetometric measurements. 

 The presented geophysical model considers that the top depth approaches 20 m 

thickness, as estimated from measurements in some locations next to Cavinatto quarry. Results 

are depicted in Figure 10, which presents, among the 2D theoretical possible models, the total 

anomaly model that best fits with our geological data, along these profiles. In fact, as drawn in 

Figure 8, calculated and observed total magnetic anomalies match very well; minor 

discrepancies, especially in the central zone of the A-B profile, are probably related to the lack 

of ground measurement stations, leading to less accurate interpolation. The differences between 

the observed and calculated anomalies, at the beginning and end of the CD and EF profiles, 

most probably, result from border effects.

model, total magnetic anomalies (at AB, CD and EF profiles) and magnetic average susceptibility measurements.

III.3. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

 The integration of ground and aerial magnetic data, geological information and 

magnetic susceptibility measurements in rocks allowed set out an improved interpretation of 

the lateral distribution and the 2D geometry of the Limeira Intrusion.  Our results suggest that 

the intrusion has an elliptical shape, occupying a top area of about 2.5 to 3.0 km2 and its thickest 

zone corresponds to the quarries north portions. The modeled two-dimensional magnetometric 

profiles support a lopolithic-like intrusion geometry very well, as previously suggested from 

geologic evidence.  

 The model has some intrinsic limitations, however, and the main drawback comes from 

field station distribution, which affects interpolation processes, as some relatively large areas 

were not sampled due to exposure problems in relation to the location of the AB profile. On the 



24 

 

other hand, the removal of the sedimentary cover, allowing direct rock exposure, increases 

magnetic anomalies, while the removal of rocky material - as in the extreme case of the 

Cavinatto quarry - decreases the total volume of ferromagnetic minerals and, thus, the magnetic 

signal intensity. These later effects cannot be properly quantified and corrected up to now and 

may lead to some misinterpretation. 

 The analysis of the two-dimensional profiles allows inferring some emplacement 

mechanisms for the Limeira intrusion. The profiles AB and EF suggest that the intrusion 

evolved, most probably, trough progressively emplacement of fresh magmatic pulses in the 

central zone of the magmatic chamber, causing its growth by the mechanism of inner-accretion 

(e.g., Menand, 2011). The north region coincides with the thicker zone of the intrusion and 

supports the hypothesis that this may be the recharge area of the intrusion. 

 The geometry and volume of the Limeira Intrusion opened ways for the development of 

several specific magmatic (e.g., magmatic recharge and differentiation) and post-magmatic 

(e.g., hydrothermal alteration) processes, turning it an interesting target for detailed petrological 

and metallogenetic studies.

CHAPTER IV 

QUANTITATIVE TEXTURAL ANALYSIS AND Sr-ISOTOPY IN PLAGIOCLASE 

APPLYING TO REVEAL EMPLACEMENT MECHANISM AND THERMAL 

EVOLUTION OF LIMEIRA INTRUSION, PARANÁ MAGMATIC PROVINCE, 

BRASIL 

Lino, L.M.; Vlach, S.R.F. 

 

ABSTRACT 

The stratigraphic analysis of compositional and textural variations, coupled with the structural 

and geometric features of an intrusive body related to Paraná Magmatic Province, allowed the 

interpretation of its emplacement mechanism and thermal evolution. Quantitative textural 

analysis through crystal size distribution (CSD) of plagioclase crystals, the spatial distribution 

pattern of structures, microtextures, granulation, and rock-types, evidenced the internal 

heterogeneities of this occurrence. In this paper, an approximately 110 m exposure section top-

to-floor of Limeira intrusion (Brazil – SP) reveals that its internal heterogeneity was caused by 

non-instantaneous successive emplacement of three different magma injections. The textural 

analysis also reveals fine-grained crystals formed under different cooling paths, present in 

medium- to coarse-grained rocks within the intrusion, next to sharp contacts between different 

rock compositions. These contacts are characterized by hybridization textures and are marked 

by large amounts of plumose granophyre-type and plumose plagioclase. The time lapse between 

consecutive pulses is responsible for a stepwise cooling-path, characterized by very contrasting 

effective residence-times at each layer, preservation of hybridization textures, and the 

development of almost rigid surfaces providing crystals alignment and clustering during magma 

flow. The isotopic and textural data demonstrates a complex assembly history, in which the 

obtained split-size between mixed plagioclase populations at the Hybrid-Zones coincides with 

the onset of Sr-isotope ratio increase, possibly involving filter pressing of residual liquids. We 

also recognize pre-existent ante-crystals before magma installation only in coarse-grained 

rocks, probably formed in a different magma chamber. The recognition of successive magma 

injections separated by a long period is a very important issue. It supports the models of tabular 

intrusion emplacement, formed by the amalgamation of sheet-like magma batches, and can be 

the response for the distribution of different compositions and textures within Limeira intrusion.

IV.1. INTRODUCTION 

 The formation and growth of igneous bodies exert considerable influence on the 

geometry and the processes of the earth's crust creation. For a long time, it was believed that 

igneous intrusions, especially of granitic composition, were formed by instantaneous events, 

through the inflation of a single or a few magma pulses. Recently, a great diversity of models 

have been created to explain the assembly, framework, and thermal evolution of several igneous 

bodies (Annen &amp;amp; Sparks, 2002; Michaud &amp;amp; Jaupart, 2006; Matzel et al., 2006; Menand, 2008; 

Annen, 2011; Kavanagh et al., 2017). Based on laboratory models, geophysical, 

geochronological, and geological evidence is currently known that small to large intrusions 

might be formed by the amalgamation of several magma pulses, probably with sheet-like 

geometries such as sills (Hawkes &amp;amp; Hawkes, 1933; Cruden, 1998; Coleman et al., 2004; 

Glazner et al., 2004; Horsman et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2011).  

 Quantitative textural analysis (i.e. Crystal Size Distribution - CSD) in igneous rocks 

aims to quantify crystals grain-size distribution, as well as its geometric arrangement, and helps 

to recover the evolutionary magmatic paths, principally to describe and quantify the acting 

mechanisms during its emplacement. As demonstrated by Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh (2002), in a steady-

state system, the development of textures is marked by a progressive and predicted increase in 

grain-size within an intrusive tabular-like body. However, the spatial arrangement of crystals is 

not the result of simple crystallization. Crystal clustering and shape preferred orientation might 

result of more complex mechanisms, as replenishments events, resulting in internal magma 

flows, and recycling of early crystal clusters (i.e. Mock et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2003; Zieg 

&amp;amp; Marsh, 2012). Furthermore, in situ isotopic ratios provide a well constrain of magmatic 

processes and evolution; and coupled with CSD analysis can result in time-lines of isotopic-

ratio evolution (Morgan et al., 2007). 

 In this work, we present a detailed, and stratigraphically constrained, quantitative 

textural analysis of plagioclase crystals, the spatial distribution patterns (SDP) of these crystals, 

in situ 87Sr/86Sri isotopic analysis, and a CSD-based thermal evolution model. We present 

geological and textural aspects relatively uncommon in similar recent studies, aiming to 

demonstrate the importance of the cooling path and the time interval between consecutive 

pulses of magma, acting directly on the style of formation, growth, and geometry of magma 

chambers. Based on quantitative methods we present an emplacement model, which has 

important implications for the magmatic evolution and heat dynamics, especially for basic-

intermediate tabular intrusions. 



27 

 

IV.2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 The Limeira intrusion is a basic-intermediate occurrence related to Mesozoic flood-

basalts of Paraná Magmatic Province (PMP). It is one among several tabular-shaped bodies 

emplaced on permocarboniferous sedimentary rocks of Itararé Subgroup, Tubarão Supergroup 

(Figure 11), which crops out in the northeast portion of São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. 

These rocks are part of the Paraná Basin, a large intracratonic sedimentary basin located in the 

south-central region of South-American continent, covering an area about 1,500,000 Km2. Its 

evolutionary late-stage processes are related to a distensive environment, responsible to the 

generation of the PMP flood basalts and the opening of Atlantic Ocean (Turner et al., 1994; 

Marques &amp;amp; Ernesto, 2004; Ernesto et al. 2002, Milani, et al. 1992; Milani, 2004). 

 

Figure 11: Simplified geological map of the central-east portion of São Paulo state in southeastern Brazil, 

depicting the main geological units and the location of the Limeira Intrusion (Modified from Perrota &amp;amp; Salvador, 

2005). 

IV.2.1. Paraná Magmatic Province  

 The PMP is one of the major continental basaltic manifestations of the world, formed 

by lava flows (ca. 450,000 km3) and intrusive occurrences (ca. 112,000 km3), which yielded ca. 

600,000 km3 of total volume. This province covers about 75% of the surface of the Paraná 

Basin, in an area of approximately 917,000 km2 (Frank et al., 2009; Piccirillo et al., 1988a). 

Classical and more recent precise Ar40/Ar39 data argue that the vast majority of lava-flows were 

formed in a short time interval, varying from 1 to 3 Ma – between 134-131 Ma (Ernesto et al., 

1999; Thiede &amp;amp; Vasconcelos, 2010). 



28 

 

 The origin of such a vast magmatic province has long been related to lithospheric mantle 

melting, under the influence of the Tristan da Cunha Plume (Peate et al., 1990,1999; 

Hawkesworth et al. 1992; Tuner &amp;amp; Hawkesworth, 1995; Marques et al. 1999; Ernesto et al. 

2002), or alternatively to the heat accumulation that occurred under the Pangea Supercontinent 

(Hartmann, 2014). Lava flows are mostly of the pahoehoe type (Waichel et al., 2006), and 

tholeiitic basalts are dominate, corresponding up to 90% in volume. Silicic rocks are majority 

rhyodacites and rhyolites that crop out in the upper flow piles, mainly at the central and southern 

province areas. The tholeiitic magmatism has long been subdivided into two main groups: low-

Ti (? 2 wt.% Ti) lava flows crop out at the base of the pile in the southern province areas, while 

high-Ti (&gt; 2 wt.% Ti) varieties made up the intermediate and top lava flows, towards the north 

(e.g., Peate et al.,1990). 

 The main intrusive bodies related to PMP constitute expressive dike-swarms, mainly 

along the South America and African coasts, while sills and laccoliths, as part of the high-Ti 

magmatism, are more frequent at eastern area of São Paulo state (Zalán et al., 1986). The 

estimated thickness of such intrusions can range between 2 and 200m in general and can reach 

up to 1,000m in localities near to the depocenter of Paraná Basin (Marques &amp;amp; Ernesto, 2004). 

Most dike swarms intrude rocks from the crystalline basement, while tabular-like concordant 

intrusions emplaced at major discontinuities of the sedimentary pile (Peate et al., 1992). 

IV.1.2. Limeira Intrusion 

 The Limeira intrusion was emplaced within sandstones and rhythmic siltstones of the 

Itararé Subgroup (Permo-Carboniferous) and exhibits a great variety of rocks-types. Fresh 

rocks are exposed at Cavinatto and Basalto 4 quarries, where the first site exhibits the most 

complete rock exposure, given by a complete section from its upper contact until a depth of 110 

meters (Lino et al., 2018). These exposures allows to examine atypical features rarely seen in 

other analogous intrusions in other analogous intrusions, such as (1) the preservation of 

structural relationship with host-rocks at the uppermost contact, (2) expanded compositional 

variation, including since basaltic to rhyolitic rocks, as well as a significant late hydrothermal 

input, and (3) a significant variety of magmatic structures and textures. 

 Given these characteristics, it becomes an excellent target for the study of emplacement 

mechanisms and related magmatic processes in tabular-like intrusions. The intrusion was 

formerly being considered as a classical sill example (e.g., Soares, 1985; Faria, 2008). However, 

recent detailed geological, petrographic and ground-/arerial-magnetometric data indicate that it 

conforms better a lopolith-like intrusion, probably formed by a number of individualized 



29 

 

magma pulses (Lino et al., 2018). These authors also draw attention to its compositional, 

structural and textural variability inwards, pointing in evidence a more complex magmatic 

evolutionary model. Geochemical and the Sr- and Nd-isotope data (Oliveira &amp;amp; Dantas, 2008; 

Faria, 2008) had suggested that the intrusion evolved through fractional crystallization from a 

basaltic primitive magma within a closed system, with some possible contamination from the 

sedimentary host rocks. 

IV.3. GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY 

IV.3.1. Host rocks and structural aspects  

 A virtually complete section of the Limeira intrusion crops out at the Cavinatto and 

Basalto 4 quarries, providing well exposures of different levels of the intrusive body. At the 

uppermost contact with the host rocks, fractures and ductile faults formed during the placement 

stage may be mapped to disclose information about its three-dimensional shape and its 

assembly process. The Limeira intrusion is emplaced within sandstones and rhythmic sediments 

of the Itararé Subgroup, which represent glaciogenic deposits. The sandstones presents cross-

bedding stratification of metric dimensions (Figure 12a), with interbedded layers of minor clay 

minerals, occurring above the rhythmic siltstones and resulting in almost horizontal and flat 

contact. Rhythmic siltstones are constituted of millimetric layers of fine-grained sands and silt, 

which occurs in shades of grey (Figure 12b), and its sub-horizontal stratification is parallel to 

the contact with sandstones. 

 The upper contact of the intrusion is almost concordant with sandstones, relatively flat, 

horizontal and follows the former sedimentary contacts between sandstones and siltstones. 

Conjugate fractures and faults systems suggest that solely the siltstones have been significantly 

deformed during the intrusion emplacement. The NW-contact of the intrusion has an average 

direction of 293.3º/50.2º, and conjugated faults occur with 113.4º/40º, resulting in horsts- and 

grabens-like structures, which should have to accommodate the deformation introduced by the 

intrusive mechanism (Figure 12c). The strong relationship between these features is 

highlighted in the stereological representation, presented in Figure 12c. 

 At the northwest region of Cavinatto quarry, a high-angle fault oriented east-west and 

dipping 85°, displaces the sedimentary contact about 10-15 meters. A mafic dike with 6 meters 

thickness and 10 meters height fills in the fault plane and is interpreted as the main feeder zone 

of Limeira intrusion (Figure 12d). By comparing the dike and structures at this region, argued 

that the main stress-field were sub-orthogonal to the faults orientation during the early stages 

of the emplacement process. It can also indicate a change in local-stress induced by the 



30 

 

sedimentary discontinuity, capable to redirect the propagation direction of its feeder dike, 

resulting in the magma infilling within this horizontal structure.

cross-bedding sandstone at the northern limit the intrusion. b) Laminar plan-parallel stratification in overlying 

rhythmic siltstone. c) Emplacement-related faults cutting across rhythmic siltstone at the northern upper contact

displacement close to the upper contact, somewhat irregular but almost horizontal. 



31 

 

 Xenoliths of host-rocks are a less frequent feature on the upper-most part of the intrusion 

and made mainly of siltstone varieties. These xenoliths have centimetric to metric dimensions 

and are tabular-shaped; occurring horizontally displayed and locally presenting displacement 

of domino-type faults, along with the N-S direction (Figure 12e). The geometry and orientation 

of the displaced xenoliths are suggestive of an engulfing process during magma installation, in 

a scenario of horizontal magma flux from north to south. 

 The heating process at the upper contact generated a ca. 1 m thick metamorphic halo 

and the development of hornfels rocks. Previous petrographic analysis of siltite-hornfels 

suggests that the metamorphic process does not efficiently affect the principal mineral phases. 

The interaction with H2O-bearing host rocks is responsible for micro-fracturing, and the 

generation of quartz- and chlorite-rich veins and fluid-inclusions traces in quartz grains (Figure 

13a). It also apparently results in the crystallization of up to 0.1 mm sized andalusite 

pseudomorphs, occurring only within millimetric clay-rich layers as rectangular-shaped 

sericitic agglomerates (Figure 13b).

General view exhibiting layers of different granulation. It is possible to observe the presence of a fine-grained 

sand, and distinctive types of venulations filled by quartz and/or chlorite with the possible hydrothermal origin, 

perpendicular to sedimentary stratification. The detail depicts quartz grains that contain fluid inclusions related 

to one of these veins. b) The detail in an argillic layer, where it is possible to observe tabular features, probably 

resulting in andalusite micro-crystals substitution. 

IV.3.2. Petrographic facies 

 The mapped basic-intermediate rocks in the Limeira Intrusion were grouped according 

to petrographic facies (e.g., Ulbrich et al., 2001), characterized by their modal contents (Figure 

14), textures and structures, as well as their stratigraphic position within the intrusion, as 

presented in the following. The distribution pattern of the different rock compositions results 

into three main groups. These groups represent rocks from the Upper Border Zone (UB), 

Intermediate zones – subdivided in an Upper Intermediate Zone (UIZ) and a Lower 



32 

 

Intermediate Zone (LIZ) - as well as the Central Zone (CZ), respectively (Figure 14). 

Accordingly, with rock structures and textures, five petrofacies were recognized from the 

intrusion borders towards the center. They include massive types, “jaguar-skin” types with 

medium- to coarse-granulation, layered types, layered-like types imprinted over a grid-like 

texture, and grid-like facies.  

 The UB comprehends micro-gabbro-types (An60-42), and for simplicity represent the 

massive facies, also including the basalts from the chilled margins and amygdaloidal/occelar 

micro-gabbroic (diabase) rocks. Rocks from each internal zones were classified as follows: (1) 

clinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorites (An50-30) with high-silica content from UIZ; (2) 

clinopyroxene granodiorite-types (An40-33) from CZ; and (3) clinopyroxene quartz-

monzodiorite (An45-27) with low-silica content and clinopyroxene quartz-diorite (An48-38), from 

LIZ. In general, the recorded modal variations are compatible with evolutionary trends common 

to the medium-K calcic-alkaline rocks (Lameyre &amp;amp; Bowden, 1982).  

 
Figure 14: QAP modal diagram for the classification of igneous rocks (Strekeisen, 1976), showing the modal 

diversity within the Limeira Intrusion. Fields: (1): gabbro/diorite, (2) quartz gabbro/diorite, (3) quartz 

monzogabbro/monzodiorite, (4): granodiorite. Letters a, b, c,d, and e identify typical trends of the tholeiitic, calc-

alkaline tonalitic/trondhjemite, calc-alkaline granodioritic, monzonitic and alkaline plutonic rock series, 

respectively, as defined by Lameyre &amp;amp; Bowden (1982). Note that basic-intermediate rocks of the Limeira Intrusion 

conform to the average trend of calc-alkaline granodioritic series. The marked increase in quartz and alkali-

feldspar contents are compatible with variations in the stratigraphic level, as well as the distribution of the 

recognized petrographic facies.

IV.3.3. Internal stratigraphy 

 Currently, the best exposures of Limeira intrusion occurs in Cavinatto quarry, where it 

exhibits a section of almost 110 meters at its southern portion and 90 meters at the northwest 

region. Its internal stratigraphy is marked by an inwards increase in rock granulation and silica 

content (principally marked by a granophyric mesostasis increasing), as well as diversification 

of textures and structures. The distribution of rock-types within Limeira intrusion occurs almost 

as concentric layers, and the variations within this intrusion are summarized in Figure 15. 

 The Upper Border Zone (UB) comprises micro-gabbroic rocks with a systematic 

inwards increase of plagioclase and opaque minerals, and a decrease of clinopyroxene, quartz 

and apatite content. The UB margins are made of massive rocks, constituted by aphanitic to 

very fine-grained diabase 1.0-1.5 meters thick, and its chilled margins probably occur along the 

entire outline of the intrusion. The uppermost contact of the diabase with the aphanitic rocks, 

down to 5m deep, is characterized by the occurrence of amygdaloidal and ocelli structures, the 

latter made up by rhyolitic/rhyodacitic fine-grained rocks. These gabbroic rocks crop out from 

~1.5 to 20-23 meters deep, showing a progressive increase in rock granulation inwards. 

 The Intermediate Zone (IZ) comprehends medium- to coarse-grained clinopyroxene 

quartz-monzodiorite types, as well as medium-grained clinopyroxene quartz-diorite at the lower 

portion. Due to the observed stratigraphic distribution, the intermediate zone includes an Upper

(Upper Intermediate Zone - UIZ) and a Lower layer (Lower Intermediate Zone – LIZ, including 

the Feeder Zone – FZ, at the bottom). The contacts of rocks from IZ with surrounding UB and 

CZ are usually sharp and marked by the presence of plumose-like plagioclase crystal habits, 

they also present a remarkable increase in granophyre content and granulation, sometimes 

associated with the concentration of felsic or mafic minerals. 

 The UIZ comprises heterogeneous quartz monzodiorite-types, presenting a “jaguar-

skin” aspect at its uppermost part, due to an irregular distribution of mafic minerals close to the 

contact, and occurring with heterogeneous distributions of felsic- and mafic-pods towards the 

central region. This zone extends from ca. 20 meters to ca. 60 meters deep and the main 

compositional variations inwards include: (1) the progressive decrease in plagioclase, 

clinopyroxene and opaque minerals content and (2) modal increase of granophyre mesostasis. 

At its bottom region, rocks are crosscut by aplitic-like veins with rhyolitic/rhyodacitic 

compositions, frequently in diffuse contacts with host-rocks. Close to its bottom contact, the 

frequency of plumose-like granophyre-type increases. 

 The Central Zone (CZ) is composed of clinopyroxene granodiorite varieties, in abrupt 

contact with the UIZ rocks. The uppermost region of granodiorite is constituted by very coarse-

grained rocks, with typical “grid-like” structures, imprinted by long cm-sized prismatic crystals 

of clinopyroxene as well as acicular ilmenite and magnetite. They represent rock types with 

relatively minor amounts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and apatite contents, and contain K-

feldspar-quartz granophyre intergrowths reaching up to ~23% in volume in their mesostasis. 

Radiating-fringe and cuneiform-types are most frequent granophyre-types in these rocks. Rocks 

that made up the lowermost part of the CZ, and the LIZ uppermost region, are characterized by 

typical “layered-like” and layered structures respectively, in a gradational contact to each other. 

Very heterogeneous granodiorites-types compose the CZ lowest layer, presenting horizontal 

lenticular-shaped pods with abundant mafic minerals, which results in the “layered-like” 

structure imprinted over the grid-like structure. 

 The LIZ rocks occur in a gradual contact with granodiorite rocks from CZ, and the main 

compositional variations downwards include: (1) progressive increase in plagioclase, 

clinopyroxene, apatite, and opaque minerals content and (2) decrease of granophyre volume. 

At the bottom of LIZ, the transition to the clinopyroxene quartz-diorite that compounds the FZ 

is apparently gradational, and both rock-types present the same “jaguar-skin” aspect. At this 

transition zone, the plumose granophyre type increases its frequency. A noticeable textural 

variation can be observed in Figure 15, which is represented by distinct increases in plumose 

granophyre-types on quartz-monzodiorite and quartz-diorite at the bottom of each rock-type 



36 

 

layer. At the Feeder Zone (FZ) of the intrusion, a remarkable magmatic flux structure is oriented 

almost vertically. These rocks-types represents a restricted area in the lowermost part of the 

outcrop, in a gradational structural and compositional contact with quartz-monzodiorites. 

 Important textural features are present at the contact between the main stratigraphic 

zones; these are represented by plumose plagioclase crystals habits, plumose- and radial-fringe 

granophyre-types are more frequent, and the presence of a “quenched” mesostasis. Acicular 

plagioclase-, clinopyroxene-, and opaque-crystals compose the very fine-grained mesostasis, 

which includes a probably second generation of fine-grained and well-formed plagioclase 

crystals. These regions are also marked by the presence of elongated clinopyroxene megacrysts 

and suggest a drastic change in cooling paths during the final stages of crystallization. Due to 

the hybridization of textures, characterized especially by plagioclase crystals with three 

different habits and formed under contrasted cooling-rates, these regions of interaction are 

classified as Hybrid Zones. 

 The crystallization final stages of the main rock-types also includes the formation of 

ocelli structures in the uppermost gabbro, as well as millimetric to centimetric-sized rhyolites 

and rhyodacites late veins and dikes. These late dikes are present since the LIZ, cutting all rocks 

on the intrusion until reaching the gabbro-types present at the UB. Apophyllite and interstitial 

low-temperature minerals (i.e. calcite, quartz, titanite, and zeolites) are evidence of a very 

important hydrothermal process, related to these late liquids and resulting in amygdaloidal 

structures. Post-magmatic substitution reactions are evidenced by chlorite associated with clay 

minerals, iron oxides, albite, and quartz, affecting all the primary mineral phases. The frequency 

of mineral substitution is greater in the regions of rock contacts, such as seen by the chlorite 

modal abundance in Figure 15.

IV.4. QUANTITATIVE TEXTURAL ANALYSIS  

 Before proceeding with the quantitative textural analysis, we carried out statistical tests 

for examining crystal size measured distributions to (1) validate the logarithmic behavior of 

crystal sizes and (2) to detect mixing between contrasted plagioclase populations. Crystal 

shapes were determined to characterize their variability within the intrusion and to perform the 

needed stereological corrections. The obtained CSD files are listed in Appendix C. 

IV.4.1. Statistical analysis of crystal-size populations 

 As suggested by our petrographic analysis, the petrographic facies from hybrid zones 

may contain more than one plagioclase crystal-size family. As predicted by the CSD theory, 

crystal sizes must present a lognormal distribution with a high frequency of small units, and if 

mixed populations do exist, the same grain-size distribution law should be valid for any 

population. The separation of different populations may be not a simple task however, and is 

detected only through significant inflections in CSD lines (Higgins, 1996). To test for 

population mixing hypothesis, statistical analyses were done considering plagioclase crystals 

major axis in all samples, supported by the expected logarithmic distribution. 

 Statistical analysis involved the representation of the crystal’s long-axes values in 

histograms, coupled to its cumulative distribution function (CDF). Samples of the hybrid zones 

present small inflections in the probability curves and small discrepancies when compared to a 

lognormal model with the same mean and standard deviation. However, the results were not 

capable to distinguish different populations. As a graphical test, the histograms were plotted 

with x-axes on a logarithmic scale, which resulted in “normal-like” distributions, excepting in 

the hybrid zones (Figure 16). 

 The logarithmic scale of the x-axis was able to avoid the superposition of the small-

sized crystals in the two families of grains. In addition, it allowed the determination of a “split-

size” (grain size, L) between contrasting grain-size families. This step is extremely important 

to the calculation of CSD regression lines when different populations are present. 

Consequently, the statistical analysis can highlight the presence of different families - on cases 

with almost straight CSD resultant curves -, also revealing more complex cases, such as the TF-

36 sample distribution (Figure 16b).

Note the bimodal distribution and inflections on the CDF curves, best developed in the Hybrid zone 1, pointing 

out to two plagioclase crystal size families. 

IV.4.2.  Stratigraphic variations of plagioclase crystal-shape and modal abundance  

 The determination of crystal shape, in three-dimensional perspective, is very important 

for CSD stereological calculation, since it aims to transform a 2-D raw data into 3-D crystal 

size. Based on non-parametric calculations, Higgins (2000) developed a method to stereological 

conversion to transform 2D crystals sections into real 3D distributions. Crystal habit is also 

important to characterize textural variations, as well as the “Closure Limit” problem intrinsic 

to the CSD analysis (see next sections). In this study, plagioclase 3-D shapes were estimated 

using the CSDslice spreadsheet, developed by Morgan &amp;amp; Jerram (2006). In general, a unique 

crystal 3-D habit for samples with different crystal-size families does not affect substantially 

the stereological corrections in our samples. The tests of axes ratio (L/S) of raw data usually 

results in very close values for both size-families, with no significant variability. 

 Crystal habits are defined in terms of the Aspect Ratio (short: intermediate: long axes – 

S: I: L) and are represented in Figure 17, in diagram I/L versus S/L (Zingg, 1935). Generally, 

from the border to the central region, crystal shape varies roughly from bladed to tabular 

respectively. As expected, prolate-shaped crystals are typical in the grid-structured 

granodiorites from CZ. Crystal shape variations can be associated with the increase in residence 

time from the intrusion edges to its central region, reflecting the tendency of crystals to become 

tabular. On the other hand, on the grid-like rock types, a different tendency can be observed, as 

it can be a result of a more complex cooling-path and crystallization history. The great variety 



40 

 

of crystal shape and the rough tendency observed within the intrusion is suggestive of different 

paths of crystallization, and certainly results of the emplacement process and thermal evolution. 

 

 

Figure 17: Plagioclase crystal morphologies within the Limeira Intrusion, as defined by their intermediate- to 

long-axis and short- to intermediate-axis relative ratios, according to Zingg (1935). See text for discussion. 

 The resultant aspect ratio, number of crystals, volumetric proportion of plagioclase, as 

well as the considered total area for each sample are present in Table 4. As observed, the 

resultant analyzed areas are very contrasting, reflecting the variability of rock-types granulation 

within Limeira intrusion. We also note that the number of analyzed crystals per volume is less 

frequent on coarse-grained rocks, probably due to an increase in grain-size and most probably 

as a consequence of the natural compositional variation. 

 From the obtained variations of plagioclase crystals habits and modal proportions, is not 

possible to observe a straight correlation of these parameters with its stratigraphic position. In 

a closed system, we should expect progressive and almost continuous changes in plagioclase 

crystal habit, due to a constant evolution of cooling-rates, and a decrease in plagioclase content 

due to the evolution through fractional crystallization. The observed dispersion, especially at 

the critical zones of rock contact, can suggest a more complex magmatic mechanism acting 

during the emplacement and crystallization of Limeira intrusion. In this sense, the resultant 

internal variability can be related with the magmatic differentiation process in association with 

perturbations of spatial distribution patterns (SPO), as demonstrated by Higgins (2002). The 

next sections are addressed to quantify the textural variations stratigraphically and to verify the 

spatial distribution patterns within this intrusion.

IV.4.3. Crystal size distribution 

 The layout of the different composition and petrographic facies are suggestive of an 

intensive fractional crystallization process and/or reinjections of successive magma pulses, 

during the formation of this intrusion. However, it is not simple to split up different magma 

batches using chemical variations or isotopic compositions. In a system under possible 

fractional crystallization or replenishment by same-origin melts and possible mixing, the 

quantitative textural analysis allows measuring some magmatic effects. According to 

compositional and textural variations, resultant CSD curves for samples of Limeira intrusion 

are depicted in Figure 18 and were divided into three main levels: borders, central region, and 

hybrid zones. Consequently, it is possible to observe a systematic increase of crystal size 

inwards, with specific variations at rock-contact zones. 



42

accordantly with similar features and stratigraphic position. Note that the legend for each sample includes the 

distance in meters from the nearest contact. a) Lower (quartz diorites) and Upper (gabbros and microgabbros) 

Border zones showing both grain size and residence time increasing inwards. b) Lower Intermediate, Central and 

Upper Intermediate Zones (quartz-monzodiorites and granodiorites) CSD plots. Note grain size increasing 

towards the Central Zone, coupled with a minor residence time increase. c) Hybrid Zone 1, from the upper contact

2, from the lower contact of the Upper Intermediate Zone, showing minor relatively inflections patterns and 

accentuated convex-humps resulting from relatively smaller crystals in sample IC-04. 

 Notably, from samples distribution, it was possible to quantify the textural variations 

within Limeira intrusion. Gabbro-types at the UB and quartz-diorite at the BIZ essentially 

compose rocks at the borders of intrusion. In Figure 18a is possible to observe in almost straight 

CSD’s lines, an increase in rock-granulation inwards as predicted for steady-state systems. 

Probably it results from a simple stage crystallization and increases in residence time inwards. 

CSD’s of samples located at the borders exhibits a more expressive convex-upwards hump 

inwards, as a result of crystal “coarsening”, a common feature that is probably associated with 

the decrease in the available melt at late stage crystallization. 

 Within Limeira intrusion, heterogeneous quartz-monzodiorites and granodiorite rocks 

constitute the intermediate and central region, respectively. The contact between these two 

rock-types is often marked by abrupt changes in texture, structure, and composition. However, 

the CSD’s lines are almost coincident in slope and minimum values (Figure 18b). Main 

differences among these CSD’s reside in its maximum crystal length values, which increases 



43 

 

into the intrusion’s core. Despite less expressive, the process of “coarsening” was also observed 

in these rocks and associated with a normal plagioclase crystallization process. 

 The so-called hybrid-zones might represent regions resulted from the extensive filter-

pressing process as well as the contact of non-instantaneous magma batches, and comprise two 

families of plagioclase grain-size at least. The first hybrid zone defines the contact of uppermost 

gabbro from UB with clinopyroxene quartz-monzodiorite from TIZ. In this zone, it is possible 

to recognize a huge variation in plagioclase grain-size, and a small inflection in the CSD curves 

(Figure 18c). In the Hybrid zone 1 (HZ1), the CSD’s of second crystal population also exhibits 

a decrease in its slope values inwards, which may be the result of an increase in residence time. 

 The outcome CSD’s of the second hybrid zone resulted in almost straight lines. 

Supported by statistical analysis, it was only possible to distinguish more than one plagioclase 

population in one sample (Figure 18d). At this region, the samples exhibit a noticeable 

humpback associated with a small proportion of very fine grain-sized crystals. In addition, the 

‘homogenization’ of crystal families is an important process, due to the increase in residence 

time inwards. Heat accumulation at the centermost region of Limeira intrusion, as well as the 

possible time span between magma batches, represent significant processes to grain-size 

homogenization. The Figure 18d depicts the CSD’s of HZ2, where it is possible to observe a 

small inflection close to 0.9-1.0 millimeter grain-size region that may correspond to the “split-

size” in Figure 16.  

 The calculation of CSD’s lines was performed through the best-regression aspect ratios 

obtained in CSDslice spreadsheet (Morgan &amp;amp; Jerram, 2006), and only crystal-size families with 

10 or more crystals were considered to CSD curves. Resultant CSD’s were then approximated 

to a regression line, enabling to estimate its final nucleation densities (n0), slope, characteristic 

length (Ci = -1/slope), and linear regressions coefficients (R
2 – very close to the maximum 

value), as summarized in Table 5. The calculation of regression lines was also performed in 

samples with evident two crystal-size families, and based on its respective “split-size” values.

IV.4.4. Internal variability of crystal sizes and CSD closure limit 

 As predicted by CSD theory, in a steady state open system the slope of straight lines is 

a direct measure of growth rates and residence time, while the intercept represents its final 

nucleation density rates. In this sense, these parameters are able to measure the variability of 

crystal sizes and the final nucleation processes in Limeira intrusion rocks. CSD curves were 

calculated for all samples, and when required to respective second families of crystals, which 

resulted in twenty regressions as shown in Figure 19. Their principal characteristic is the 

exponential relationship between these parameters, which results in a decrease in the nucleation 

process coupled with an increase of crystal-sizes and consequently increase in residence time. 

Besides that, the variation of crystal-sizes is apparently very dependent on its stratigraphic 

position. 

 A different path constituted by the second population of crystals present on the hybrid-

zones can be noticed. It results in relatively lesser intercept values than rocks at intrusion 

borders, with close values of characteristic length. This feature might be the result of different 

cooling-rates and may suggest a very contrasting process of heat loss between rocks from the 

edge and inner contacts. The formation of a second family of crystals within an intrusion made 

of holocrystalline rocks can result of magma mixing, and/or the increase in the nucleation 



45 

 

process due to reheating caused by new magma batches, details of this feature are discussed in 

the next sections. 

 

Figure 19: Plot of plagioclase characteristic length variations as a function of the CSD lines intercept (final 

nucleation density, n0) for the results of this study. Calculated closure limit for the average plagioclase aspect 

ratios (short-: medium-: long-axis = 1:1,6:2.8) considering 100 vol.% crystals (heavy dotted line), 50 vol.% and 

150 vol.% (lower and upper light-dotted lines, respectively), following Higgins (2002). Note data distribution 

along the closure limit and their dependence of the intrusion stratigraphy (central vs. borders zones). The hybrid 

zones data describe a contrasted path, indicating a relatively lower plagioclase nucleation density. See text for 

discussion.  

 In some cases, the plagioclase crystals can constitute more than 50% of modal 

abundance in analyzed samples. Thence, even if it results in straight lines, CSD’s must be 

verified if stereological conversions have been correctly effectuated. Conversion of two-

dimensional into three-dimensional data can result in the closure problem, in which individual 

phases cannot exceed 100% of rock (Higgins, 2002). As consequence, this system can be 

verified by comparing the CSD’s intercept and its resultant characteristic length (Ci = ???), which 

is a constant for each CSD line (Ci = -1/slope). Therefore, the closure limit is dependent on the 

assumed crystal shapes, and its volumetric proportion. It means that discrepancies in it can be 

the result of CSD calculations, and errors in the determination of crystals shapes and/or 

proportions. In our case, the closure limit was calculated for the following aspect ratio: 

1:1.6:2.8, which represents the mean 3-D shape for plagioclase crystals in samples. 

 In Figure 19 is shown the closure limit calculated to crystals with an aspect ratio of 1: 

1.6: 2.8, roundness factor equals zero (RF = 0), and three different volumetric proportions, 

100% +50% in accordance to Higgins (2002). The outcome validates the resultant CSD lines, 

plagioclase volumetric proportion, and shape. Variation of characteristic length and CSD 

intercept are directly related to sample stratigraphic position, which occurs parallel to the 

Closure Limit and close to the 50% line. An important effect observed in this model is the 



46 

 

inwards decrease of plagioclase modal abundance, compatible with real compositional 

variations. 

IV.4.5. Spatial distribution patterns of crystals  

 Generally, the emplacement of igneous bodies compounds of a great diversity of 

physical mechanisms, which is also responsible to modify the spatial distribution of crystals 

(Mock et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2003). The application of modal-proportion versus 

characteristic length diagram can provide important information about magmatic processes, as 

suggested by Higgins (2002). In this diagram, almost a systematic variation in modal abundance 

of plagioclase versus CSD’s can be observed, principally in the textural coarsening to the 

centermost region of the intrusion, which is also coupled with the decrease in modal abundance 

(Figure 20). Variations in modal abundance of plagioclase are directly related to chemical 

variations of rock composition, and in a closed system, a strong correlation with crystal sizes 

may be expected. However, as shown by the shades in Figure 20 samples from the hybrid zones 

exhibits greater values of modal abundance than ‘expected’, based on our model, for the same 

crystal size, in this intrusion. 

 

Figure 20: Plagioclase characteristic length variation as a function of modal abundance, parameters take as 

representative of growth-rate and growth-time, respectively (Higgins, 2002). The arrow indicates the approximated 

trend of textural coarsening within Limeira intrusion; shaded areas depict the dispersion of the Hybrid Zones in 

relation to the main expected trend. See text for discussion.  



47 

 

 As well as in CSD’s versus modal abundance diagram, the SDP analysis also shows a 

roughly systematic variation. In the diagram, R-value versus Matrix Volume (Figure 21) it is 

possible to note that our samples exhibit a touching framework in a clustered distribution, with 

an almost progressive inwards decrease in R-values. A practically direct variation can also be 

observed, in which the increase in R-values is coupled to the decrease in matrix volume, starting 

from the borders to the centermost region of the intrusion. 

 
Figure 21: R-values versus the matrix abundance (= 100% - plagioclase% vol.) for the CSD results obtained in 

this study. The Random Sphere Distribution Line (RSDL), as calculated by Jerram et al. (1996), limits clustered 

from ordered crystal arrangements. Note an almost progressive increase in R-value, coupled to decrease in matrix 

proportion, from the center to border regions within Limeira intrusion. The shade highlights an observed 

dispersion, caused by rocks present on Hybrid Zones. See text for discussion.  

 This relationship is compatible with the compaction/overgrowth trends and presents a 

great dispersion on its intermediate zones. The dispersion on the evolutionary tendency is more 

evident in rocks from hybrid zones. As shown by the shade in Figure 21, this is the result of an 

increasingly poor sorting trend, where samples of uppermost hybrid zones presenting non-

touching and even ordered frameworks. For tabular intrusions, the R-value method predicts an 

increase in crystal clustering (decrease in R-value) in regions close to its walls, or even between 

successive magma batches. In this way, the observed dispersion may be the result of a more 

complex emplacement process. 

 The variations of SPD parameters observed in this intrusion are not compatible with a 

simple stage emplacement, in which the most important dispersions are related to hybrid zones. 

In this sense, the representation of the R-value, as a function of the depth of the samples, can 

possibly provide more information about magmatic mechanisms. The results of SDP within 

Limeira intrusion as a function of each sample’s depth are synthesized in Table 6.

IV.4.6. Emplacement mechanisms and influence of magma flow to rock fabric 

 During the emplacement of igneous bodies, the magmatic flow and shear are capable to 

modify the SDP and orientation of crystals, in the chamber. Analogously to a laminar flow in a 

pipe, the magma flowing within tabular structures (i.e. dikes and sills) can transport large 

crystals towards its interior (Mock et al., 2003). The effect of sheet-like intrusions emplacement 

can result in characteristics R-values profiles, and consequently clustering increase to its 

borders (Jerram et al., 1996), as well as close to contacts between consecutive magma batches 

(Mock et al., 2003). 

 A profile of SDP parameters (R-value and Alignment Factor versus depth) is presented 

in Figure 22a. The stratigraphic variation of the clustering coincides the lowest R-values (i.e. 

increase in clustering) with the zones of contact between different rocks, and consequently, it 

is remarkably coincident with hybrid zones. On the other hand, the highest values of clustering 

roughly represent the transitional region between different lower-R zones. As seen in Figure 

22a, the hybrid zones are highlighted by rectangular shades and coinciding with low R-values 

in three main zones, each one separated by the highest R-values. 

 Depending on the magma volume and replenishment rate, in a confined environment, 

the magma flow might align the minerals in the crystallization process. Consequently, the 

orientation of crystal long-axes in profiles may highlight distinct regions, where the layer 



49 

 

boundaries can be defined by the increase of crystals alignment. Considering this, we 

constructed a mean crystal orientation profile, which is based on sample stratigraphic position 

and the plagioclase Alignment Factors (AF) (Figure 22b). 

 Accordingly, the obtained results of AF from most of the tested samples are relatively 

low when compared to rocks with visible preferential crystal shape orientation. On a scale of 0 

to 1, the general values of alignment vary from 0.03 to 0.26, reaching 0.59 in only one sample, 

representative of the feeder zone and not represented in this profile. Even resulting in small 

values, the variability of crystal alignment is apparently dependent on its stratigraphic position 

and related to the hybrid zones. As shown in Figure 22b, the highest values of crystal alignment 

correspond to the hybrid zones, while the lowest values coincide with regions farthest from 

those areas. Mean crystal long-axis orientation usually results in almost horizontal values at the 

hybrid zones and can be more dispersed at other positions, as evidenced in Figure 22b. The 

rose diagrams in Figure 22c exhibits the dispersion of crystal orientation, revealing the 

preferential crystal orientation horizontally displayed, roughly parallel to N-S general direction.

IV.4.7. Sr isotope constraints and ICSD plots 

 The initial 87Sr/86Sr values as well as the analytical spots distances from plagioclase 

crystal cores - obtained for selected samples from the Hybrid zone 1 (HZ1), Central zone (CZ), 

and Feed zone (FZ) - are listed in Table 7, and represented in ICSD-type plots in Figure 23. 

As seen, sample IC-07a from HZ1 present a marked isotope ratio increase from plagioclase 

core to rims (Figure 23a), a pattern also observed for sample TF-36, from CZ (Figure 23b). 

Contrastingly, the opposite behavior can be observed at the FZ, where the Sr-isotopic and 

crystal-sizes exhibits a negative correlation, and the isotopic signature of the FZ-plagioclase 

rims are close to those observed in HZ1 and CZ plagioclase cores.

Sample IC-07a, from the Hybrid-zone 1. Note the kink in the CSD curve coinciding with an abrupt change in 

isotopic ratios highlighted by the dotted line. b) ICSD plot for TF-36 sample, present in the central region of 

Limeira intrusion, and c) LIM-02 sample, present at the intrusion’s feeder zone. Boxes were drawn with ±2? of 

uncertainty on isotopic ratios. Initial ratios calculated for a 132 Ma age. The Upper horizontal gray bar represents 

a whole-rock isotopic initial ratio, from Oliveira &amp;amp; Dantas (2008), and the lower horizontal light-red bar represents 

the average baseline common for all samples.  

  Despite being preceded by an apparently gradual variation, the noticeable increase in 

the isotopic ratio of the sample present at HZ1 (Figure 23a) coincides with a significant slope 

increment in CSD curve. This relationship may be attributed to mixing between filtered-residual 

melt present in the first magma batch and the second magma injection during the crystallization 

process, which generate the fine-grained plagioclase family by changing the nucleation- and 

cooling rates. Variation in isotopic ratios for plagioclase crystals from HZ1 and CZ samples 



51 

 

exhibits similar trends, reaching similar isotopic ratios. Even not exhibiting a kink in CSD 

curve, histograms for centermost granodiorites frequently presented complex long-axis 

distributions (Figure 16b). Coupled with isotopic analysis, the results indicate a probable 

magma mixing, which results in plagioclase populations that may have crystallized at the same 

conditions, marked by the linear CSD results. 

 In general, isotope ratios vary from a minimum of ~0.7054 to maximum values up to 

~0.7057. From 87Sr/86Sr variation ranges, it is possible to recognize an expressive average 

isotope ratio (~0.705467 ± 25) as a baseline, represented as the horizontal light red bar in Figure 

23, present principally in CZ and FZ samples. A more detailed analysis in ICSD plots can reveal 

the ubiquitous presence of inherited crystal-cores, occurring as antecrysts and representing the 

largest plagioclase crystals. As observed, inherited cores from HZ1 exhibits the same isotopic 

ratio than most of CZ plagioclase crystals. On the other hand, the isotopic ratio from CZ 

plagioclase inherited cores can reach values of ~0.7053, and crystals between ~6 to 2 mm of 

size represent a plateau of isotopic ratios, probably sharing the same evolutionary history of 

antecrysts present in the sample HZ1, and crystal rims in FZ sample.

IV.4.8. Residence time and thermal evolution  

 CSD measurements and sample stratigraphic positioning allow to estimate the residence 

time for plagioclase and to suggest a thermal evolutionary model for the intrusion. If the 

plagioclase growth rate (G) is constant, it can be calculated from the CSD’s lines slopes when 

the residence time (?t) is known (Eq. 1); from growth rates and the CDS line intercepts, we can 

estimate the nucleation rate (J). Taking the shape of the Limeira Intrusion as tabular in a first 

approximation, residence time may be obtained according to Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh (2002) formulation, 

given by: 

? = ?? = ?

??2
?                                                                (7) 

where z, measured in centimeters, is the distance from borders to the central region of the 

intrusion, k is the constant of thermal diffusivity (k = 10-2cm2s-1), and b is the isotherm constant 

(b = 0.475) (Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh, 2002).  

 The distances between samples and the intrusion top were measured directly, while the 

distances from the intrusion bottom and samples downwards the central region were estimated 

from available magnetometric modeling (Lino et al., 2018). The obtained values for the ?, G, J, 

and cooling rates are summarized in Table 8. The cooling rates were computed considering 

liquidus and solidus temperatures about 1250ºC and 850ºC, respectively, as estimated with 

Rhyolite-MELTS (Gualda &amp;amp; Ghiorso, 2014), compatible volatile contents and crystallization 

close to the QFM (quartz-fayalite-magnetite) buffer.  Residence time values vary from ca. 231 



53 

 

to 108.367 days from the intrusion upper border to its central region, which results in 

contrasting cooling rates ranging from 1.733ºC/day to 0.004ºC/day, respectively.

*Estimated values of edge distance, from geophysical modeling (Lino et al., 2018).  

 Intrusions that evolves at fixed cooling rates present a typical intercept-slope relation on 

CSD patterns, given by a CSD line fan when representative samples are plotted altogether, and 

the relative position of a CSD pattern within that fan can be related to the respective sample 

position in the intrusion (Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh, 2002). A similar situation is observed in the Limeira 

patterns, and to check the hypothesis of steady-state crystallization the correlation between CSD 

intercept [ln(n0)] and slope (S) values must satisfy the equation: 

ln(?0) = 4 ln(?) ? ln(?)                                                       (8) 

where C is the dimensionless constant. Results are depicted in Figure 24a and demonstrate that 

the Limeira Intrusion does not conform such a single model. Our patterns define two contrasted 

correlate sets with contrasted cooling paths, one including samples collected in the upper half 

of the intrusion and the other grouping samples from the lower half as well as the fine-grained 

plagioclase populations from the hybrid zones. This indicates different cooling rates, which 

may be caused by the emplacement of new magma batches at the intrusion’s lower half. 

 The crystal size variations within tabular-like intrusions are directly resultant of the 

crystallization paths and helps to understand their thermal evolution. Zieg &amp;amp; Marsh (2002) add 



54 

 

a time constant ??  to the crystallization time ? to account for intrusion thickness, as the 

parameter ?? in Eq. 1 is related to the mean crystal sizes, to obtain: 

??? = ?(? + ?? )                                                                  (9) 

where ??  is larger in the case of higher contact temperatures and intrusion thickness, as the 

cooling at intrusion’s contacts demands more time to begin. In Figure 24b we plot sample 

depth (Z), the distance from tothe p and bottom intrusion edges, vs. the mean grain-size (???) of 

the main plagioclase crystal populations to compare our data with those predicted by the steady-

state model. In this diagram, we plot simulations for ? and ? values representative that best fits 

with the centermost and upper border samples, where the models must include growth ratios 

ranging from the maximum and minimum estimated values, 3.0 x 10-9 mm.s-1 to 1.20 x 10-10 

mm.s-1, respectively. 

 

Figure 24: Diagrams illustrating the main variation patterns of plagioclase CSD parameters and depth within the 

Limeira Intrusion. The two model curves in each plot show the expected behavior in steady-state crystallizing 

systems. a) Intercept vs. slope plot: relatively homogeneous samples from several stratigraphic positions within 

the intrusion are represented in blue; samples from the hybrid zones and from the lowermost intrusion level in 

black. b) Depth (*distance from the nearest contact) vs. crystal mean length plot. Both diagrams indicate significant 

departures from single models based on a steady-state magmatic evolution. Constant C=2.  

 As seen, the first model describe with a good fit the observed crystal-size variation of 

the central and bottom regions, while the second model accounts the grain-size coarsening from 

the uppermost region. On the other hand, the intermediate intrusion zone does not conform to 

any single model, which may instead point to a thermal re-equilibration between the adjacent 

upper and centermost zones that evolve along two different cooling paths with distinct heat 

transfer rates.  



55 

 

 Considering that the observed crystal-size variation results from multiple injections of 

magma replenish the magma chamber, the time-span between consecutive pulses is an 

important issue. From the CSD data alone, it is not possible to constrain the time interval among 

them. Nevertheless, some information may be extracted from the analysis of the residence time 

of the second plagioclase crystals generation, which might represent the crystallization final 

stages, and compared to each other. In our case, we assumed an increase in the nucleation-rate 

that resulted in the second generation of crystals. In this sense, the residence time was estimated 

using samples present at the borders that exhibit similar CSD slopes, based on their nucleation-

rate as a reference (i.e. TF-05 and IC-08, J = 7.82 and 98.68 x 10-7). Moreover, the results of 

residence time, cooling-rate, reference nucleation-rates, and volumetric proportion of the 

second plagioclase families are presented in Table 9.

 As noticed, the residence time for plagioclase crystals at the HZ1 (IC-07a) is less than 

a fifth of crystallization time for crystals at the HZ2 (IC-04c), and hence, suggests a more rapid 

cooling due to the thermal gradient. In addition, the residence time increases inwards (IC-07b), 

with increasing distance from rock contact. At the hybrid-zones, the volumetric proportion of 

fine-grained plagioclase is apparently constant, ranging from ~10% to 11.5%, despite the 

drastically inwards decrease. The volumetric variation can suggest a distancing from the zone 

of interaction between consecutive magma batches and is not observed in HZ2 due to the large 

time of crystallization taken, as well as the possible thermal re-equilibration 

IV.5. DISCUSSION 

 The following sections are addressed to explain and purpose some mechanisms of 

emplacement that acted during Limeira intrusion formation. To accomplish it, we considered 

based several features, such as the magma physical properties, isotopic evidence of magmatic 

interaction, and the effects of time-span between consecutive magmas pulses. We also 



56 

 

discussed the bases of recent models of tabular intrusions formation, and the geological and 

geometric models for this intrusive occurrence (i.e. Lino et al., 2018). 

IV.5.1. Structural and compositional aspects 

 The layout of structures and contact between Limeira intrusion and host-rocks are 

compatible with some predicted mechanisms of intrusion formation. The sedimentary 

discontinuity is an important feature, responsible for the creation of an environment with 

considerable rheological contrast, which accommodates the first magma batch. The host rocks 

do not present a great rheological contrast, and the formation of a dike protrusion is compatible 

with the laboratory models of Kavanagh et al. (2017) (dike-sill hybrid geometry). The increase 

in local stress probably results in the horizontal magmatic spreading, responsible for initiate the 

emplacement of the intrusion. 

 In Figure 25a this process is synthesized based on our data, where the sedimentary 

contact is responsible for a lithological discontinuity and rheological contrast that acted as a 

trap. The lack of faults in the sandstone suggests that the first magma pulse might have increased 

the rheological contrast within the sedimentary rock discontinuity, and the evolutionary process 

of emplacement occurred by mid-accretion of new magma batches (Figure25b, c). 

 

Figure 25: Charts illustrating the proposed emplacement model for the Limeira Intrusion. a) First magma pulse 

emplacement through the feeder dike along a sub-vertical discontinuity. Continuous flow and intrusion along the 

siltstone-sandstone horizontal contact actionng as a “less-stress” structural plane, which results in faulting and 

upward moving of the sandstone layers over the flow. b) The first magma pulse increases the local rheological 

contrast, providing the emplacement of subsequent magma batches within the first intrusion, at the region with 

more ductile behavior. c) The installation of the latter magma pulse, resulting of mid-accretion and final estimated 

geometry of Limeira intrusion, results of the same acting emplacement mechanism. d) Expected CSD patterns 

within the constitute intrusion and hybrid zones, velocity profiles, deduced from R-value distributions, and simple 

shear components at the contacts between magmatic pulses.  



57 

 

 Even comprising stratigraphic compositional variations that include some abrupt 

contacts between different rocks-types, the layout is still compatible with a ‘closed-system’ 

under fractional crystallization. The main compositional changes are associated with structural 

and textural variations, principally next to the contacts, where facies are distributed as 

concentric layers. In general, it is possible to distinguish three main layers with the same 

structural aspects in this intrusion. The first layer is comprised by gabbro-types; quartz-

monzodiorite types with high silica content and the quartz-diorite types, due to the similar 

structural “jaguar-skin” aspect compose the second layer and finally; and the third layer is 

composed by granodiorite and quartz-monzodiorite types with low silica content, defining the 

layered series. 

 All these three layers are limited by textural variations associated with structural and 

compositional changes. In the second and third layers, rocks with similar structures and textures 

compose each one. In addition, it is possible to observe in both layers some common features, 

as the presence of silica-rich rocks in the uppermost region, and silica-poor rocks at the bottom. 

These compositional characteristics certainly result in almost independent evolutionary 

histories to each layer, as the response of fractional crystallization and/or other magmatic 

processes as crystal settling or immiscibility process due to the presence of layered rocks, for 

example. 

IV.5.2. The influence of magma emplacement dynamics on CSD and SDP 

 The resultant CSD and SDP of plagioclase crystals are clearly stratigraphically 

dependents. Through CSD analysis, it was possible to recognize a systematic inwards increase 

of grain size, as well as to describe at least two zones of rock contact with more than one crystal-

size family. Furthermore, the analysis of the crystals long-axis orientation revealed a strong 

correlation between the SPO and SDP parameters at the Hybrid Zones. From these results, and 

coupled with structural, geological, and available geophysical data, it was possible to conceive 

the evolutionary process of emplacement for the Limeira intrusion (Figure 25). 

 As expected during the emplacement of tabular intrusions, the velocity profiles of 

magma increase from its edges to the center, while the orientation of crystals increases at the 

boundaries. From SDP (R-values) and orientation tests, it is possible to distinguish at least three 

different zones within Limeira intrusion, which each one is limited by relatively great variations 

of these parameters (Figure 25d). Orientation tests resulted in a relatively low-values of 

Alignment Factors, probably due to the plastic behavior of the “conduct-walls” during magma 



58 

 

emplacement. However, the stratigraphic distribution of crystal orientation values and the mean 

orientation angle are still compatible with a multiple stage emplacement. 

IV.5.3. ICSD analysis and evolution of crystal populations 

 The Sr-isotopic analysis of available whole-rock data revealed an inwards decrease in 

radiogenic strontium ratio in the Limeira intrusion, which ranges varied from 0.707250 at the 

chilled margins to 0.7057717 at the “central gabbro", and reaching up to 0.7059697 in the 

rhyolite veins (Oliveira &amp;amp; Dantas, 2008). Coupled with the obtained in situ microanalyses of 

plagioclase crystals, these variations are compatible with the purposed mechanical model of 

emplacement. The 87Sr/86Sri ratio decreases progressively inwards, and as evidenced by sample 

LIM-02 from the Feeder Zone, it also indicates a decreasing trend in the assimilation of host-

rocks by fresh magma pulses. Consequently, it is compatible with a model with added 

progressive replenishment, in which successive magma pulses through the same conduit does 

not make contact with the host-rocks. 

 Close to Hybrid Zones, crystals rims exhibit more radiogenic Sr-ratios than in the cores, 

revealing that secondary plagioclase family could be the result of “magma mixing” associated 

with filtered residual melts migration. This process may be responsible for the crystallization 

during the reheating, and observed humpbacks in UB CSD’s might result from the extraction 

of residual liquids. The isotopic results, associated with textural and compositional features, 

corroborates with the mechanism of filter pressing, which may be caused by hyperbolic shear 

flow during the emplacement of fresh magma pulses. Analysis In situ also reveals an important 

contribution of antecrysts in rocks with medium- to coarse-grain sized, a product of the putative 

mixing between the two latest intrusions. Although indicating a more complex history, 

plagioclase crystals present at the central region of Limeira intrusion were submitted to a simple 

stage crystallization history, and their presence probably increases the estimated residence time 

due to its common large sizes. 

IV.5.4. Effects of time-span between magmatic pulses and thermal evolution 

 The thermal evolution of any intrusion is the direct result of its volume, heat 

accumulation, and heat transfer. In this sense, the volume of successive magma batches and the 

time span between magmatic pulses exercises a fundamental role in cooling-rate in addition to 

the textural evolution. In the case of the Limeira intrusion, it is possible to recognize a 

systematic variation on its textures, principally those on the clinopyroxene and plagioclase 

shape, and granophyre-types, which are not compatible with the available thermal models. In a 



59 

 

steady state system, formed by one or a few magma pulses in a constant accretion-rate, the same 

textural variation is virtually not possible. 

 Considering the thermal models and the metamorphic process of host-rocks, our results 

enable us to suggest that a small but first pulse initiated the intrusion process, where it acted as 

a thermal insulation. Furthermore, at least three magma pulses formed the intrusion. Evidence 

of these three different cooling-paths events is based on the variation of mean grain-size, as 

seen in Figure 24b, and the inflection zones that connect the two different models of mean-

length variation corresponds to rocks of HZ 1 e HZ 2.  

 A detailed structural and micro-textural analysis, coupled with isotopic microanalysis 

and stratigraphic distributions, allowed us to identify regions of magma interaction within the 

Limeira intrusion. The preservation of these structures and textures are the result of the time-

span between consecutive magma batches. The time-span may seem long enough to cause a 

great difference in cooling-paths, and if magma composition of successive pulses is considered 

the same, then the great thermal gradient between these magma batches is a direct result of 

differences in crystallinity. Finally, based on the marked presence of two-plagioclase grain-size 

families, as well as the difference of residence time, we suggest that the time-span between the 

first and second pulses was greater than the interval between the second and third.

IV.6. CONCLUSION 

 The integration of host-rock structural aspects, the compositional features of rock-types, 

textural distribution, quantitative textural analysis and in situ isotopic ratios of Sr in plagioclase 

crystals, allowed us to interpret and quantify the emplacement process and the thermal evolution 

of Limeira intrusion. Consequently, our results strongly support a multiple-stage igneous 

evolution, caused by non-instantaneous successive emplacement of different magma pulses 

during the assembly of this intrusion. The apparent alignment (SPO) and clustering (SPD) of 

crystals corroborate with the amalgamation process of successive sill-like magma batches, on 

the formation and growth of this intrusion. Moreover, the isotopic data suggested small amounts 

of country rocks assimilation and an important contribution of the filter-pressing mechanism 

during its emplacement and evolution, and probably contributing to the increase in silica content 

and great diversity of rock-types. 

 Internal compositional and structural heterogeneities of Limeira intrusion has long been 

related solely to the process of fractional crystallization in a closed-system, associated with 

filter pressing. However, the CSD’s strongly suggest crystals had grown under the influence of 

changes in the cooling path. In addition, the inwards variation of grain-size also supports the 

three thermal-independent reinjections model, which resulted in a great internal accumulation 

of heat. Major cooling between batches provided an important rheological response, being 

capable to act as a trap for consecutive pulses. It was responsible for the generation of a rigid 

surface in a confined environment, where crystals have aligned and clustered. Additionally, the 

complex thermal evolution of Limeira intrusion might be a great influence for its structural, 

textural, and compositional heterogeneities, as well as its magmatic evolutionary process. 

 Even comprising layered rocks, crystal alignment is not compatible with the mechanism 

of crystal settling or flux-segregation, as observed in many analogous occurrences. Therefore, 

these results might open avenues for characterization and quantification of specific magmatic 

processes, which acted during the formation of Limeira intrusion. As a result, this study 

provides significant data, which can be tested and, perhaps, extrapolated to other layered 

intrusions, especially those related to heat maintenance and other specific magmatic 

mechanisms.

CHAPTER V 

V.1. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 The integration of ground and aerial magnetic data, geological information and 

magnetic susceptibility measurements in rocks allowed set out an improved interpretation of 

the lateral distribution and the 2D geometry of the Limeira Intrusion. Additionally, host-rock 

structural aspects, the compositional features of rock-types, textural distribution, quantitative 

textural analysis and in situ Sr-isotopic ratios in plagioclase crystals, allowed interpret and 

quantify the emplacement process and its thermal evolution, respectively. The main conclusions 

of this dissertation may be highlighted as follows: 

(1) The Limeira intrusion has an elliptical-like shape from its top-view, occupying a top 

area of about 2.5 to 3.0 km2 and its thickest zone corresponds to the Cavinatto quarry 

north portion; 

(2) The modeled two-dimensional magnetometric profiles support a lopolithic-like 

intrusion geometry, as previously suggested from geologic and petrologic evidence 

(e.g., Lino, 2015); 

(3) The analysis of the two-dimensional profiles allows inferring that the intrusion 

evolved trough progressively emplacement of fresh magmatic pulses in the central 

zone of the magmatic chamber, causing its growth by mechanisms of inner-accretion 

(e.g., Menand, 2011); 

(4)  The northern region coincides with the thicker zone of the intrusion, and supports 

the hypothesis that this may be the feeder area of the intrusion; 

(5) Compositional and textural data strongly supports a multiple-stage igneous 

evolution, caused by non-instantaneous successive emplacement of different magma 

pulses during the assembly of this intrusion, coherent with the results based on the 

obtained geophysical model; 

(6) The apparent alignment (SPO) and clustering (SPD) of plagioclase crystals 

corroborates with an amalgamation process made up by successive sheet-like 

magma batches; 

(7)  The available and obtained Sr-isotopic results, coupled with textural analysis, are 

suggestive of small amounts of country rocks assimilation, especially from the rock-

types present at Limeira intrusion borders, and evidenced by inherited-anticrystal 

cores (with high 87Sr/86Sr ratios) in the feeder zone; 



62 

 

(8) Additionally, an important contribution of the filter-pressing mechanism, during its 

emplacement and evolution, is evidenced by the high 87Sr/86Sr ratios obtained in the 

plagioclase crystal rims and/or smallest crystals, formed during magmatic mixing at 

Hybrid Zones. Probably the filter-pressing has contributed to the increase in silica 

content inwards and the great diversity of rock-types; 

(9) The assembly process can be attributed to the amalgamation of at least three magma 

pulses, each one emplaced within the precursor. It results in a stepped-wise cooling 

process, in which each magmatic layer evolves separately and heat accumulation 

may be responsible for the extremely coarsening of the inner rock-types; 

(10) Finally, the results open new avenues for detailed thermal studies, based on the 

total size of the intrusion and the estimative of each magma pulse volume. Also can 

be used to reveal the influence of consecutive magma pulses in the heterogeneous 

distribution and variety of hydrothermal mineral phases; 

(11) The chemical stratigraphy and modeling of the magmatic evolution can also 

indicate the influence of continuous replenishments and heat accumulation within 

this magma chamber. Already obtained chemical results are compatible with the 

proposed emplacement model and reveal that each magma pulse might have evolved 

almost independent. In addition, layered structures recognized in the last injection 

may be associated with magma unmixing in the tholeiitic line of descent.
