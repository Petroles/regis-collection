agradecimentos A lista de agradecimentos é extensa, seja a pessoas, seja a instituições que 
me apoiaram durante o decorrer dos trabalhos. Considerando a estrutura 
modular desta tese, os agradecimentos relativos a partes ou capítulos da tese 
são feitos no fim de cada um desses capítulos. Deixo para esta secção os 
agradecimentos a apoios transversais ou de extrema importância. 
Tive a sorte de integrar uma rede de investigadores já existente com um 
historial de colaboração em diversos aspectos da Geologia e em diversas 
áreas geográficas. Depois de me mostrar interessado em trabalhar em 
aspectos da Estratigrafia e Paleontologia ainda durante o curso de licenciatura, 
o Prof. Paulo Fonseca tornou esse interesse num projecto. Ele foi quem me 
apresentou a muitos dos investigadores que me apoiaram durante todo o 
tempo da tese. Ao Paulo agradeço o seu incansável apoio, paciência e 
discussão científica dos temas da tese, mesmo quando inundado em trabalho. 
Os seus vastos conhecimentos da Geologia de várias regiões de Portugal 
foram essenciais para o desenvolvimento da tese. 
Ao Prof. Fernando Rocha, orientador principal, que na Universidade de Aveiro 
tornou possível a montagem de um laboratório de Palinologia funcional. A ele 
agradeço todas as portas que abriu, quer do ponto de vista científico quer da 
parte académica dentro da Universidade. Não obstante a sua função directiva 
na reitoria da Universidade durante grande parte da duração da tese, 
conseguiu, com a sua invejável capacidade de coordenação, gerir uma vasta 
equipa no seio de um centro de investigação, no qual me inseria. 
Ao Prof. Hélder Chaminé por todo apoio dado, especialmente nas fases iniciais 
do projecto que me permitiram “entrar” de facto da área de estudo. O seu 
trabalho ao longo da zona de cisalhamento Porto-Tomar formaram a espinha 
dorsal sobre a qual o meu trabalho se desenvolveu. 
Ao grupo de investigadores do Instituto de Geologia da Academia de Ciências 
da República Checa por todo o apoio desde o primeiro momento, em diversos 
campos da Geologia. As várias estadias em Praga foram extremamente 
enriquecedoras, pelo acolhimento logistico, científico e pessoal. Gostaria de 
destacar o apoio do Doutor Jind?ich Hladil, Doutor Ladislav Slavik e a Doutora 
Leona Koptiková, que sempre, mesmo no meio de intenso trabalho, me 
apoiaram no decorrer dos trabalhos.  
À Doutora Milada Vavrdová do mesmo Instituto que orientou o meu estágio 
antes do início do Doutoramento e continuou como orientadora no 
Doutoramento. A ela devo grande parte do conhecimento que hoje tenho de 
Palinologia do Paleozóico. Apesar da sua longa carreira e desejo de se dedicar 
aos membros mais novos da sua familia no descanso da casa de campo, 
adiou consecutivamente essa vontade (entre outras razões) para permitir a 
orientação desta tese. 
À Prof. Deolinda Flores que em diversas situações me apoiou logistica e 
cientificamente na área da Petrologia Orgânica e me fez sentir benvindo no 
Departamento de Geologia da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do 
Porto. 
Ao Prof. Geoff Clayton do Trinity College Dublin por ter sido quem, pela 
primeira vez, me falou em Palinologia e Petrologia Orgânica durante a estadia 
em Dublin ainda como aluno de licenciatura e ter continuado a dar apoio 
durante o decorrer da tese. 
Ao Prof. Mário Cachão que foi um dos catalizadores do meu interesse em 
Estratigrafia desde tenra idade. No decorrer do Doutoramento sempre facilitou 
o uso do equipamento do Centro de Geologia da Universidade de Lisboa e 
com quem pude discutir temas relativos à tese. 
Aos meus colegas do Departamento de Geociências da Universidade de 
Aveiro, com quem tive a oportunidade de partilhar experiências e 
conhecimento e permitiram fazer-me sentir em casa numa Universidade e 
cidade que não conhecia. 
Aos meus colegas da Departamento de Geologia da Faculdade de Ciências da 
Universidade de Lisboa que fizeram das longas horas de trabalho uma 
experiência agradável pela sua boa disposição e amizade. Com eles beneficiei 
da troca de experiências e de conhecimento. 
Vários colegas palinólogos com quem tive oportunidade de falar e discutir 
aspectos relevantes da Palinologia, quer durante congressos quer em visitas 
às suas instituições. De referir Rainer Brocke do Forschungsinstitut 
Senckenberg de Frankfurt; Olda Fatka da Universidade de Carlos, Praga; 
Jacques Verniers da Universidade de Gent; Maurice Streel da Universidade de 
Liège; José Pedro Fernandes do Departamento de Geologia, Faculdade de 
Ciências da Universidade do Porto; Thomas Servais da Universidade de Lille.

resumo Neste trabalho descreve-se e interpreta-se a estratigrafia e palinologia de 
rochas sedimentares e metassedimentos de idade devónica e carbónica 
aflorantes ao longo da zona de cisalhamento Porto-Tomar, a Sul na Bacia de 
Santa Susana e em vários locais onde afloram os Calcários de Odivelas. 
Existe um registo de sedimentação descontínuo possivelmente associado a 
esta zona de cisalhamento desde o Devónico Superior até ao Pennsylvaniano. 
Desde o Devónico Superior até ao Mississippiano esta sedimentação é 
marinha, de carácter essencialmente turbiditico com uma tendência geral para 
se tornar mais proximal. A maturação térmica atingida por estas rochas 
(Unidade de Albergaria-a-Velha) é alta e a unidade é considerada pós-madura 
em termos de potencial gerador de hidrocarbonetos. O metamorfismo 
incipiente é acompanhado por intensa deformação. 
A bacia do Buçaco é inteiramente terrestre e tem a sua idade restrita ao 
Gjeliano (Pennsylvaniano superior). O controlo da sedimentação pela 
actividade da zona de cisalhamento Porto-Tomar é evidente. A sua maturação 
térmica é relativamente baixa (dentro da catagénese) e a deformação menos 
intensa, contrastando com a Unidade de Albergaria-a-Velha com a qual parece 
ter uma relação geométrica complexa, de origem tectónica. As relações de 
campo e dados da maturação térmica permitem inferir um evento térmico e de 
deformação à escala regional entre o Serpukoviano e o Gjeliano e outro, 
essencialmente de deformação, entre o Gjeliano e o Carniano (Triássico 
Superior). 
A bacia de Santa Susana tem características semelhantes à do Buçaco, visto 
estar enquadrada também numa zona de cisalhamento importante que neste 
caso separa a Zona de Ossa-Morena da Zona Sul Portuguesa. A sua idade é 
kasimoviana, possivelmente também moscoviana (Pennsylvaniano médio). A 
evolução térmica da bacia e a relação estrutural com as unidades circundantes 
permite inferir um evento térmico e de deformação regionalmente importante 
entre o Viseano e o (?)Moscoviano-Kasimoviano. 
O estudo detalhado de vários locais onde afloram os Calcários de Odivelas 
permite desenhar uma paleogeografia regional durante o intervalo Emsiano 
terminal-Givetiano (fim do Devónico Inferior – Devónico Médio) para o sector 
Oeste da Zona de Ossa-Morena: Actividade vulcânica em regime marinho (e 
talvez subaéreo), formando edifícios vulcânicos no topo dos quais (e 
possivelmente também em altos fundos estruturais) se instalaram recifes, 
tendo a comunidade recifal, em termos de diversidade, persistido durante todo 
ou grande parte deste intervalo de tempo. O evento Chote? basal é observável 
num destes locais.

abstract The Palynology and Stratigraphy of Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary 
rocks and metasediments outcropping along the Porto-Tomar shear zone are 
described and interpreted. The Palynology and Stratigraphy of the Santa 
Susana Basin and of the Odivelas Limestone are also described and 
interpreted.   
There is a discontinuous sedimentary record possibly associated with the 
Porto-Tomar shear zone extending from the Late Devonian to the 
Pennsylvanian. From the Late Devonian to the Mississippian, the 
sedimentation was marine, essentially turbiditic, with a general shallowing 
trend. The thermal maturation of these rocks (Albergaria-a-Velha Unit) is high, 
and the unit is considered to be post-mature in terms of hydrocarbon 
generation potential. The incipient metamorphism is accompanied by intense 
deformation.  
The Buçaco basin is entirely terrestrial and its age is restricted to the Gzhelian 
(upper Pennsylvanian). The sedimentation is clearly controlled by the Porto-
Tomar shear zone. Its thermal maturity is relatively low (within catagenesis 
range) and the deformation milder, contrasting with the Albergaria-a-Velha Unit.
The contact between the two is tectonic. The field evidences and the thermal 
maturity data of the basin and surrounding units point to an important regional 
thermal and deformation event that took place between the Serpukovian and 
the Gzhelian and another, essentially tectonic, between the Gzhelian and the 
Carnian (Upper Triassic). 
The Santa Susana basin has similarities with the Buçaco basin as it is also 
within an important shear zone, in this case separating the Ossa-Morena and 
South Portuguese Zones. Its age is kasimovian, and possibly moscovian 
(middle Pennsylvanian). The thermal evolution of the basin and the structural 
relations with the surrounding units point to a regional scale thermal and 
tectonic event occurring between the Viséan and the (?)Moscovian-
Kasimovian.  
The detailed study of several occurrences of the Odivelas Limestone allow an 
insight to the regional palaeogeography of the Western Ossa-Morena Zone 
during the latest Emsian – Givetian interval (latest lower Devonian – middle 
Devonian): marine (and possibly sub-aerial) volcanic activity forming volcanic 
buildings on top of which reef communities developed (and possibly on 
structural highs). The reef biota persisted, in terms of diversity, during all or 
most of this time interval. The basal Chote? event is recorded in one of these 
occurrences.

1.1 Purpose, scope and reasons for study 
 The Porto-Tomar shear zone and the associated metamorphic belt have been 
studied for a long time (e.g. Sharpe, 1849; Ribeiro, 1860; Delgado &amp;amp; Choffat, 1899, 
1901), but the scope of these studies was always restricted to metamorphic geology (e.g. 
Sousa-Brandão, 1914a, 1914b; Severo-Gonçalves, 1974; Mendes, 1988), tectonics and 
structural geology (e.g. Freire de Andrade, 1938-40; Ribeiro et al., 1980).  

It was Hélder Chaminé during the course of his PhD work (Chaminé, 2000) who 
identified a different unit of shales and siltstones (later called Albergaria-a-Velha unit). 
The unit had not been differentiated from the Arada unit which was shown to be older 
and with a higher metamorphic grade (Beetsama, 1995, Chaminé et al., 2003). This 
newly differentiated unit seemed to have a much milder metamorphic grade (when 
compared with the remaining units of the metamorphic belt) and, in some localities, had 
preserved primary (sedimentary) structures. The immense lithological similarities and 
intricate geometrical relations of the Arada and Albergaria-a-Velha units precluded their 
cartographic differentiation, a problem that persists today. Although there are a few 
criteria to differentiate the two in the field (in the presence of fresh and non-mineralized 
outcrops) it is almost impossible to distinguish the two in weathered or mineralized 
outcrops or using loose boulders. Regrettably geomorphological criteria, soil colour, 
vegetation type, and other criteria are not applicable.  
 The palynological tests conducted by J.P. Fernandes (Porto University) on 
samples collected by H. Chaminé provided poorly preserved assemblages of spores and 
acritarchs (Fernandes, et al., 2001). This paper allowed a first glimpse on the 
sedimentation ages (Devonian and Carboniferous), palaeoenvironmental conditions and 
maturity of the Albergaria-a-Velha unit. It was clear that a broader, in-depth study of the 
unit was needed. The proper identification of the ages, sedimentary palaeoenvironments 
and thermal maturity and history would have significant consequences for the 
characterization of the geodynamics of the Porto-Tomar shear zone over time (see 
Chapter 3).  
 The Buçaco basin (Pennsylvanian, not metamorphosed) was also investigated 
due to its geodynamic setting: a pull-apart basin along the Porto-Tomar shear zone 
(Gama Pereira, et al, 2008; Flores et al., 2010). Its detailed study and the proper 
characterization of the contacts between the surrounding units would provide important 
data for the interpretation of the dynamics of the Porto-Tomar shear zone (see Chapter 
4). 

A similar reasoning led to the investigation of the Santa Susana basin 
(Pennsylvanian, not metamorphosed), which is not related to the Porto-Tomar shear

zone s.s. but  rests along a dextral N-S shear zone in SW Portugal (Santa Susana shear 
zone) and is most probably a pull-apart basin (Almeida et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 
2007) (see Chapter 5).  

Within this shear zone there are several occurrences of limestone bodies. These 
are scattered along the shear zone and also along the Ferreira-Ficalho fault (see Chapter 
6) where they seem to be spatially connected with the Odivelas Limestones. The 
possible spatial and temporal connection of all these limestone occurrences is explored 
in this work as well as the implications for the dynamics of the Santa Susana shear zone. 
 Furthermore the Odivelas Limestone is one of the few examples of Middle 
Devonian sedimentation in Ossa-Morena Zone and provides a unique opportunity to 
constrain the ages of tectonic, magmatic and metamorphic events regionally. It also 
provides important elements for the local and regional palaeogeography and regional 
and global palaeobiogeography. 
 For each basin or unit, a group of fundamental objectives were defined and 
presented as scientific questions. The ways to answer these questions defined the 
methods to be used. These in turn defined the specific tasks to be performed (field work, 
literature check, palynology sampling and processing, etc.). These ideal work flow 
tables were not fully executed due to time and budget constraints. It should also be 
mentioned that some of the methods applied did not provide significant results (see each 
chapter for discussion). 
 The discussion whether the questions were answered or not and how well were 
they answered is debated in the appropriate section of each chapter. Naturally new 
questions appeared that remain unanswered. These are presented throughout the 
chapters.

1.2 Geography and nature of outcrops 

1.2.1 Espinho-Miranda do Corvo area 
The area in which the metamorphic belt associated with the Porto-Tomar shear 

zone crops out corresponds to a relatively hilly region, contrasting with the generally more 
flat area to the West that corresponds to the Meso-Cenozoic sediments of the Lusitanian 
basin. This can be readily observed in any satellite or aerial photo of the region. Outcrops 
were located in altitudes between 5m (Angeja area) up to about 400m (Buçaco area), 
although most were between 50 and 200m (see Fig. 1.1B). To the East the Central Iberian 
Zone corresponds to a hilly to true mountainous region (see Fig. 1.1A and B). 

Most of the area is covered either by native forest (restricted to some valleys – 
maquis and Quercus forest) or by extensive Eucalyptus cultivated forest as a consequence 
of the poor soils and orographic characteristics. In either case outcrops are scarce and often 
heavily degraded. In many areas loose boulders are the only available geological 
information.  

The region is densely populated, especially North of Aveiro, where there is dense 
urban sprawl leaving few preserved natural or agricultural areas. To the South of Aveiro 
there are significant populated areas around cities like Coimbra, Águeda and Mealhada, but 
there are also extensive areas with farmland and natural or cultivated forest (see Fig. 1.1E). 

The region has a good network of motorways, national, regional and city roads. Dirt 
roads abound in the more rural areas and are usually well kept. Nearly every geological 
locality can be accessed by car to usually less than 1km from it (see Fig. 1.1D). There is 
one major train line crossing N-S, taking trains from Lisbon to Porto, but also regional 
train lines connecting towns and villages to major cities like Coimbra, Aveiro and Porto. 
From Coimbra there are regional train lines to the E and NE that cross some of the studied 
areas around Coimbra and to the Buçaco area. The Vouga train line connects Águeda to 
Aveiro and from here to the N up to Espinho, passing by many of the small towns and 
villages referred in this work. Unfortunately trains in this line are very infrequent and the 
line is said to be deactivated in a near future. 

For this study, the most suitable outcrops were found in road cuts and train line 
cuts. These are often relatively tall (&gt;2m), fresh to moderately weathered outcrops. These 
were suitable to sample for palynology and organic petrology and to describe sedimentary 
and stratigraphic characteristics (when available).

Other types of outcrops such as dirt road floor, natural river banks, valley slopes, 
etc., were almost invariably too weathered to sample or to provide any sedimentary 
information. Structural data could, nevertheless, be obtained from many of these.

1.2.2 Odivelas reservoir, Santa Susana and surrounding 
areas. 

Nearly all the Alentejo region is considered to be a peneplain (e.g. Feio, 1951) with 
natural outcrops restricted to stream/river beds, banks and slopes. The Odivelas dam and 
the areas to the W and NW (including the Santa Susana area) are also peneplain areas, but 
there are important streams and rivers around which outcrops can be found. Vegetation is 
usually restricted to cultivated Quercus forest which has little influence on outcrop quality. 
Native forest (usually thick shrub forest) is restricted to more remote and incised valleys. 
Most outcrops are located between 50 and 100m of altitude.

There is a good network of motorways, national and regional roads. Dirt roads 
provide access to most of the localities within the distance of 1km. There are no relevant 
active train lines in the area. 

Population density in very low and has little effect on the quality and quantity of 
the outcrops. 

In the Odivelas area, the reservoir fills the relatively incised valley of the Ribeira de 
Odivelas which has abundant outcrops. Most are flooded during part of the year, but some 
are observable even during the wet season. Some abandoned quarries provide additional 
outcrop information. Loose boulders abound in many areas.  

The Santa Susana area is relatively hilly, with Ribeira do Freixial and other 
streams’ valleys providing fresh and continuous outcrops in its beds and banks. The Pego 
do Altar reservoir has similar characteristics to the Odivelas reservoir and several good 
outcrop areas can be found around its banks. Additional outcrops are found in some road 
cuts.  

In the Monte da Pena and Caeirinha areas, outcrops are restricted to small 
abandoned quarries and more rarely to stream beds. Most of the information derives from 
loose boulders.

1.3 General Geological setting 
The Iberian Massif (IM) constitutes the largest exposure of pre-Mesozoic rocks of the 

Iberian Peninsula and the largest exposed area of the European Variscides without 
significant (Alpine) reworking (Dallmeyer &amp;amp; Martinez Garcia, 1990).  
 The IM was divided into several zones according to their metamorphic, 
stratigraphical and structural characteristics. The zonation initially proposed by Lötze 
(1945) was later modified by Julivert &amp;amp; Martinez (1983) and Ribeiro et al. (1990). The 
northern branch (West Asturian-Leonese and Cantabrian Zones) and southern branch 
(South Portuguese Zone (SPZ)) generally show a milder deformation (upper crustal level), 
lower metamorphic degree and are essentially composed by Palaeozoic rocks. The central 
parts of the IM (Ossa-Morena (OMZ), Central Iberian and Galicia – Trás-os-Montes

Zones) have generally higher (although highly variable) metamorphic degrees, stronger 
tectonism (lower and upper crustal level) and are composed by pre-Cambrian and 
Palaeozoic rocks. Allochthonous terranes of oceanic nature border and are comprised 
within the central areas and reflect collision settings that occurred during the Cadomian 
and Variscan orogenies (e.g. Fonseca &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Ribeiro et al., 1990, 2009). 

The OMZ is a major geotectonic unit located in the southern sector of the Iberian 
Massif (Lötze, 1945; Julivert &amp;amp; Martinez, 1983, see Fig.1.3). The OMZ southern border 
comprises highly deformed exotic terranes of oceanic nature (including the “Pulo do Lobo” 
Accretionary Terrane (PLAT) and the Beja-Acebuches Ophiolitic Complex (BAOC)), as 
complex tectonic melanges (Almeida et al., 2001; Araújo et al., 2005; Booth-Rea et al., 
2006; Fonseca &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Fonseca et al., 1999; Figueiras et al. 2002; Mateus et al., 
1999; Ribeiro et al., 2009). These formations are rimming an early main Variscan suture in 
the southwest of the Iberian Massif and they accreted to the OMZ before the Middle/Upper 
Devonian times (Fonseca &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Fonseca et al., 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2009). The 
BAOC separates the OMZ and SPZ, which is regarded as another exotic terrain, that 
accreted to the OMZ during Carboniferous times (Dallmeyer et al., 1993). 

The OMZ is composed by several domains or units which have complex tectonic 
settings (Quesada, 1990; see Chapter 6). These domains were defined according to their 
stratigraphic, metamorphic and magmatic characteristics, although the division is not 
consensual (e.g. compare Oliveira et al., 1991 with Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 
2004). 
 The northern branch of the OMZ is composed by a metamorphic belt that rests 
along the NNW-SSE trending Porto-Tomar Shear Zone (PTSZ) (Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé 
et al., 2003; 2007; Gama Pereira, 1987). This belt comprises several autochthonous and 
parauthocthonous tectonostratigraphic units with low to high metamorphic grade (Beetsma, 
1995; Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé et al., 2003; Gama Pereira, 1987). These units are 
essentially Proterozoic (Beetsma, 1995; Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé et al., 2003), but Upper 
Palaeozoic rocks are present (Albergaria-a-Velha unit) (Chaminé et al., 2003, Fernandes et 
al., 2001). 
 Recently Ribeiro et al. (2007) proposed a different “affinity” for this metamorphic 
belt. They describe this belt as “Finisterra continental slices” which would have been 
juxtaposed over the OMZ at the same time as the BAOC. 
 Further details of the Geology of each area are presented in the appropriate 
chapters.

2.1 Field work, stratigraphical procedure and 
general sampling methodology 

 Field work was conducted using rented vehicles and, in most instances, the 
author’s own vehicle. Military topographic 1/25000 scale maps were used as a standard 
for field work. Frequently these were adapted to include geological information plotted 
with ArcGIS software and printed in the appropriate scale. The geological information 
derives from the Portuguese Geological Survey’s 1/50000 scale geological maps, 
detailed maps from published literature and in the case of the Odivelas Limestones, 
from copies of field maps used by António Soares de Andrade in the course of his PhD 
work (Andrade, 1983). 
 Geological mapping was not part of the objectives of this thesis, but simplified 
geological maps of some areas were constructed (e.g. Covas Ruivas and Cortes 
localities, Odivelas Limestone, with the collaboration of an undergraduate student from 
FCUL). 

Stratigraphical procedure was conducted regularly at the Buçaco and Santa 
Susana basins and at the Covas Ruivas locality of the Odivelas Limestone. Lithological 
columns were constructed using a metric tape measure and beds described taking into 
account lithology, fossil content, grain size, etc.. Samples were collected for several 
purposes (mostly for palynology) at regular intervals to ensure a representative 
sampling or to study specific aspects of a bed.  

For other localities of the Odivelas Limestone loose boulders were sampled for 
corals, stromatoporoids and other fauna to be observed and more rarely as conodont 
samples. 

For nearly all the areas and outcrops of the Albergaria-a-Velha unit, an adapted 
procedure was used. The strong deformation did not allow the construction of columns 
or, at best, these were limited to a few meters of vertical extent. Preserved sedimentary 
information (lithology, grain size, sedimentary structures) was described when 
available. Sampling methodology for palynology was adapted to ensure spatial 
representative coverage and that packages of rocks with different dominant lithologies 
(e.g. black shales vs. fine sandstones with rare shales) were not over or under sampled. 
Although the use of a grid would be desirable, the scarcity of outcrops with sufficient 
quality precluded its use. 

2.2 Palynological procedure 

2.2.1 Introduction
There is a great number of papers regarding palynological maceration techniques 

(e.g. Batten, 1999; Phipps and Playford, 1984; Traverse, 2007; Wood et al., 1996). All 
methods describe a series of steps with physical desegregation and chemical processing. 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

20

Most of them also include oxidation methods and other procedures that facilitate 
palynological observation. 

In all of them the aim is to eliminate the mineral component of the sample and 
obtain a residue composed entirely of organic matter. This is based on the fact that 
organic matter is not attacked (or easily attacked) by neither Hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
nor Hydrofluoric acid (HF). 
 Usually a combination of acid attacks is used to eliminate all the mineral content 
of the rock and a set of physical separations of the resulting residue to obtain a 
concentrated organic residue with the correct particle size. 
 For each step a short description and discussion is made and the method used in 
this work is described. This text was richly improved with suggestions and contributions 
from many palynologists and palynology lab technicians (personal communications). 

2.2.2 Sampling 
Ideally, samples for palynological purposes should be taken from fresh surfaces, 

non-weathered and especially with no signs of oxidation (which destroys 
palynomorphs). The outermost parts of the outcrop should be discarded as they are 
probably oxidized and contaminated with living/recent organic debris. Depth of 
weathering varies with climate, time of exposure, lithology, among other factors (Rowe 
and Jones, 1999, Traverse, 2007). Ideally the sample should be taken from about 50cm 
into the outcrop to ensure minimal weathering. In practice for this work samples were 
taken from fresh or slightly weathered (most common situation) outcrops. These were 
very frequently road cuts. Evident mineralization, oxidation and deformation features 
were avoided. Fractures and other penetrating surfaces (including bedding planes) were 
avoided as these are preferential weathering “ways”. Vegetated outcrops were not 
sampled. In some cases a big chunk of rock was detached from the outcrop and 
hammered to obtain fresh, non-mineralized, “not-too-deformed” pieces of rock

A few hundreds of grams were collected in most instances. Samples were 
labelled and bagged to avoid cross contamination and erroneous indexation. When 
collecting, samples were referenced with GPS coordinates and/or signalled in 1/25.000 
scale topographic maps. Characteristics of the sample such as lithology, colour, 
weathering stage, mineralization, deformation, etc. were noted and transferred to a 
computer database using FILEMAKER software. 

Borehole samples stored at the Portuguese Geological Survey and at the 
Geosciences department, Aveiro University were invariably washed cuttings. These 
were bagged and labelled the same way as for the remaining types of samples. 

2.2.3 Cleaning and crushing 
One or a few blocks (to be crushed) were cleaned with running water and 

washed with brushes and detergent if necessary. All the dust on the sample surface was 
removed as this is a source of contamination (other rocks, airborne dust, pollen fall, 
etc.) and consumes the acid for no purpose (Fatka pers. com.). Knives or scraping 
objects (Tongeren, pers. com.), compressed air and ultrasounds (Clayton, pers. com.) 
were used occasionally to clean the sample. 

Theoretically, the greater the sample’s surface area, the greater the efficiency of 
the acid reaction. This is limited by the size of palynomorphs (megaspores and 
chitinozoa are around 200?m) and the probability of breaking many palynomorphs with 
crushing. Jones (1998) suggested that the most efficient crushing size is between 0.7 
and 1.71mm for consolidated lithologies, but many workers use pie-sized particles (e.g. 
Vavrdová, pers. com.; Riding &amp;amp; Kyffin-Hughes, 2004; Vecoli, pers. com.; Verniers, 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

21

pers. com.). Samples were wrapped with a plastic bag or foil and crushed with a 
hammer. 

The amount of sample needed varies from worker to worker, but 5g is a standard 
amount referred by many (e.g. Eshet &amp;amp; Hoek, 1996; Jones, 1998; Riding &amp;amp; Kyffin-
Hughes, 2004). The amount needed to have enough residue for several slides and to 
keep some for later studies will ultimately depend on the amount of organic matter 
initially present in the sample and the effectiveness of the processing technique. Thus 
the amount of sample used will depend on the lithology and the estimated organic 
matter content. For dark grey and black shales and fine siltstones about 5 to 10g were 
obtained from about 100g of initial cleaned sample, sieved to 0.7-1.7mm or 1-2mm 
sizes. For limestone samples up to 100g of pie-sized pieces were used. 

2.2.4 Hydrochloric acid (HCl) 
Hydrochloric acid is used to eliminate carbonates present in the sample. This 

step was not always used. Each sample was tested for carbonates and HCl attack was 
only used if the test is positive. HCl was observed to promote the release metal content 
of some rocks (apparently non-carbonated), especially Fe oxides, observed in the form 
of a green liquid. The amounts needed to dissolve a rock sample were indicated by 
Jones, 1998: 20ml of concentrated HCl (37%) is twice the amount need to, in theory, 
dissolve 5g of CaCO3. This can serve as a basis for calculating corresponding amounts 
of rock, acid and concentrations.

Table 2.1– Proportion of sample weight and the amount of 10% HCl needed to theoretically 
dissolve it. 

 In all known published procedures and laboratories visited, reaction time is less 
than 24 hours, usually 3, 6 or 8 hours or simply “over night” (e.g. Fatka pers. com; 
Riding &amp;amp; Kyffin-Hughes, 2004; Vavrdová, pers. com.; Verniers, pers. com.)  

Some published procedures indicate a complete neutralization before the HF 
attack (e.g. Eshet &amp;amp; Hoek, 1996). Theoretically the Ca ions are released into solution 
with the HCl attack and can be removed from the system by decanting this solution. To 
remove virtually all the Ca ions, 2 or 3 dilution-decanting cycles in 1L bottle (washing) 
are needed. If not properly removed, Ca and other ions will react with HF and form 
insoluble Ca fluorides that, although transparent, can effectively decrease the quality of 
the final residue. Complete neutralization is time consuming and unnecessary.  

2.2.5 Hydrofluoric acid (HF) 
HF is used to eliminate all silicates and other minerals (Langmyhr &amp;amp; Sveen, 

1965). It is usually used after the HCl. According to Jones, 1998, 50ml of concentrated 
HF (37%) is twice the amount needed to dissolve 5g of SiO2. The effectiveness of the 
reaction is improved by temperature increase (Langmyhr &amp;amp; Sveen, 1965). The 
dissolution of crystalline silica and silicates tends to form silica gels and precipitates 
that cover sample particles, decreasing the effectiveness of the reaction (Tongeren, pers. 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

22

com.). Langmyhr &amp;amp; Sveen, 1965 argued that for the complete dissolution of silicate 
minerals (not applied to palynology) stirring did not influence reaction times or 
efficiency. Brocke, pers. com and Fatka, pers. com. referred that stirring and the use of 
an orbital shaker reduced reaction times from a week to 1 or 2 days. Thus stirring, either 
mechanical or heat induced is generally recommended to ensure a complete reaction. 
The ions released by the acid reaction may form precipitates with the F ion which needs 
to be eliminated. Some minerals are particularly resistant to HF and HCl attack, namely 
zircons, tourmaline and other unidentified minerals. These are especially frequent in 
metamorphosed sediments. Reaction times vary greatly according to the lithology 
(minerals present), temperature, stirring, amount of acid and of sample. Fernandes (pers. 
com.) mentioned that the reaction can take only a few minutes for some black shales 
with no heating. Frequently reaction times are between a few days (e.g. Tongeren, pers. 
com.) up to 2 weeks (Clayton, pers. com.) with no heating. Orbital shakers are common 
in palynology laboratories to catalyse the reaction and remove silica gels from particle 
surfaces, especially during the first hours of the reaction (e.g. Tongeren, pers. com., 
Streel, pers. com., Brocke, pers. com.) and the reaction time is typically one or two 
days. Another method used is a static method with heating or no heating. This is used to 
process samples for megaspores or Pre-Cambrian samples (Streel, pers. com.) and 
chitinozoa (Ghent University). This reduces breakage of specimens to a minimal. It is 
probably also useful for high maturity and metamorphosed samples, when the 
palynomorphs loose their elasticity, but would be extremely laborious and time 
consuming. Heating is usually done using a water bath at 70 or 80ºC. Warming the 
residue in a hot plate can produce a differential heating of the residue and thus 
inappropriate catalysis of the reaction. 
 When adding HF it is advisable that the sample is at least humid so that the HF 
penetrates easily the rock pieces and it also makes the reaction milder (Fatka, pers. 
com.). 
 Two methods of HF attack were used in this study. Both are described bellow. 

Cold HF 
 10 to 15g clean, crushed samples were placed in a 1L plastic bottle. 40% HF was 
added according to the amount of sample, using the following table as a reference (from 
Jones, 1998) 

Table 2.2 – Proportion of sample weight and the amount of 40% HF needed to theoretically 
dissolve it. 

Each sample was left to react for periods up to 1 month, depending on the 
effectiveness of the reaction. The bottle is stirred frequently in the first minutes of 
reaction and then every 24h. Neutralization is done by successive dilution-decanting 
cycles until the liquid is apparently neutral (usually [HF] &amp;lt;0.005%).

Microwave 
 The procedure used in this work followed very closely the one suggested in Ellin 
and Mclean, 1994. The microwave device available at Aveiro University is the CEM 
MDS-81D, exactly the one used in the referenced paper. This method increases the 
effectiveness of the reaction by heating the sample and HF in a pressurized 
environment.  
 The available vessels are different, allowing a set of 12 samples to be processed 
in each run. Each sample can be up to 2,5g, but for safety reasons and to ensure 
complete dissolution 2g were used in most instances. Duplicates of the 12 sample set 
were used in successive runs to obtain a total dissolved weight of 4 or 5g. Each vessel 
holds 13ml of 40% HF. The microwave device is activated for 20min at 100% power 
and left to cool down for 1h. This step is done for safety reasons, but also because 
reaction still takes place while the temperature is high. Neutralization was done in a 
similar way to the cold HF method. 
 The safety procedures and specifications for acid digestion of several kinds of 
minerals and rocks can be found at the CEM Co. website.

Adapted from the operation manual. 

2.2.6 Second hydrochloric acid (HCl) attack 
Ca fluorides, other neo-formed crystals and undissolved minerals are very 

frequently present after HF attack. These can be removed with a second HCl attack. 
Often this is made using hot or boiling 10% HCl (Brocke, pers. com., Vecoli, pers. 
com., Streel, pers. com.) for a few minutes up to half an hour. Heating can be done 
using a water bath, Bunsen beaker or thermal plate. Alternatively another, milder, 
method is to use cold 10% HCl for a few hours (Tongeren, pers. com.). The 
“aggressiveness” of the attack will depend on the amount of undissolved minerals. More 
mature and metamorphosed samples tend to have more of these minerals.  

The standard method used was to boil the residue in a 10%HCl solution over a 
thermal plate for a period of about 15min. This was found to be very effective in 
destroying most of the mineral fraction present after HF attack.

2.2.7 Centrifuging 
Centrifuging is used in some laboratories to facilitate decanting and 

neutralization (using water or an acidic liquid). It is also used as a density separation of 
palynomorphs from other silt sized particles (Fatka, pers. com.). Heavy liquids are used 
in this case. The dried or humid residue is placed with the heavy liquid and 
palynomorphs will float and most minerals will sink. Centrifugation accelerates the 
process. This implies that the density of the liquid is very precisely known in order to 
eliminate also the lighter minerals. Centrifuging is used as an alternative to sieving in 
some cases. The applicability of this method for mature and metamorphosed samples is 
limited because palynomorphs may have pyrite and other minerals inside the chamber 
and attached to spines or growing around the wall. It may also be case that increased 
carbon content on the wall of palynomorphs may change its density. If any of these is 
the case, palynomorphs will sink along with the heavy minerals. This method was not 
used in this study. 

2.2.8 Sieving 
Spores and acritarchs are rarely smaller than 10?m and most of them are greater 

than 20?m (Traverse, 2007). Thus the pore size of the meshes should be between 10 and 
20?m. Very frequently organic residues have significant amounts of very small 
particulate OM and AOM, and also film-like kerogen that tend to clog the sieve and can 
make observation of palynomorphs harder if they remain in significant proportions. If 
the residue is sieved in a 10?m mesh, the result is a very “close to original” organic 
assemblage but very “dirty”, i.e. full of fine particles of kerogen. Sieving with a 20?m 
mesh produces a very clean residue but some organic content information is lost 
(Tongeren, pers. com.). This is especially important if palynofacies and kerogen typing 
is being made. A possible compromise is to use a 15?m mesh. Megaspores and 
chitinozoa are bigger and a 43 or 63?m size mesh is usually used to separate them from 
the rest of the residue. 

For most samples a 15?m size mesh was used. For some samples with high 
concentration of very small (10?m and smaller) acritarchs, a 7?m size mesh was used. 
In all cases a small portion of the non-sieved residue was kept. 

2.2.9 Watch Glass, pipetting, floating, specimen picking.  
Acritarchs and other palynomorphs, if not highly carbonized or with minerals 

inside the chambers, will float on water and will remain floating due to water surface 
tension (Fatka, pers. com.). Using this principle, specimens can be pipetted out using a 
binocular microscope.  

Another density/hydrodynamic behaviour separation technique consists on the 
usage of a rotating watch glass with the residue. Centrifugal force will segregate heavier 
and lighter organic particles allowing its separation (Clayton, pers. com.). 

For megaspores and chitinozoa individual specimens are observed, usually not 
an assemblage in a slide. Thus they are usually pipetted out from a watch glass or a 
Petri dish under a binocular microscope (Verniers, pers. com.).  

These methods were not used for this study. 

2.2.10 Oxidation 
Palynomorphs and most organic matter suffer a colour change with the increase 

of temperature (Bostick, 1971; 1979; Marshall &amp;amp; Yule, 1999). This is due to the loss of 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

25

volatiles and relative increase in carbon content (Marshall &amp;amp; Yule, 1999). This is a 
gradual and irreversible process (Marshall &amp;amp; Yule, 1999). Sporopollenin is the essential 
component of most spores and a similar compound makes up acritarch walls (Traverse, 
2007). Although they react differently to temperature and geological time, the tendency 
is always towards grey or black colour and to loose transparency. This gradual 
darkening obscures many features and distinctive characteristics of palynomorphs and 
in extreme cases, only a rounded black opaque particle is observed. Elasticity is also 
gradually lost during this process (Vavrdová, pers. com.).  

Several chemicals can be used to lighten palynomorphs and make them 
translucent so that their morphological characteristics can be observed. Mild products as 
H2O2, NaOCl (bleach) and stronger ones as HNO3 alone or as Schultze’s solution 
(HNO3 1:3 KClO3) are commonly used (Clayton, pers. com.; Colbath, 1985; Eshet &amp;amp; 
Hoek, 1996; Gray, 1965; Jones, 1998; Marshall, 1980). Heating catalyses the reaction 
(Jones, 1998). The use of these chemicals also has a dispersing action, especially useful 
for AOM and soluble kerogen which can obscure palynomorph observation (Eshet &amp;amp; 
Hoek, 1996).  

Residues needing oxidation are typically black and oxidation has taken effect 
when they change to coffee brown or to a lighter colour (Fernandes, pers. com.; Pereira. 
pers. com.) 
 For the samples from the Buçaco and Santa Susana basins, a mild oxidation 
procedure using diluted NaOCl (house hold bleach) was used. A small portion of the 
organic residue (enough for one or two slides) was placed in a small glass container. 
About 100ml of (ca. [4%]) bleach were added and the mixture left to react.  After the 
initial 18 hours a small amount of residue was pipetted out and checked for correct 
oxidation extent under a microscope. All samples were successfully oxidized after 18 to 
36 hours. The method was ineffective for samples with higher maturation (Albergaria-a-
Velha unit). 
 A strong oxidation procedure using Nitric acid and also Schultze’s solution was 
tested with residues from the Albergaria-a-Velha unit. The results were poor and in 
most cases all the residue was lost, even after short periods of oxidation. As a second 
best option the residues were mounted to observe palynomorphs under a microscope 
with reflect light – see below. 

2.2.11 Acetolysis 
This is used to remove excessive OM in the form of organic acids. KOH and/or 

acetone are frequently used. Depending on the oxidation reactant used and the amount 
of fine kerogen in the residue, this step can be suppressed or not. Low quantities of fine 
kerogen and/or the use of an oxidizing agent that disperses OM may be sufficient to 
obtain a clean residue after sieving. If acetolysis is needed, the reactant should be 
applied during sieving or immediately prior to sieving. 

This method was not used for this study. 

2.2.12 Mounting 
Two methods were used to mount the organic residues. One was used to observe 

palynomorphs under the microscope with transmitted light (acritarchs, palynofacies, and 
sporomorphs with low TAI) and the other with reflected light (sporomorphs with TAI &gt; 
4). 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

26

Mounting to observe with transmitted light 
Mounting the final OM residue should be made using the thinnest slides (1mm 

thick) and cover slips (no. 0 or 1). This allows proper observation under the microscope, 
especially when focusing is concerned. Accordingly the mounting medium must be kept 
to the lowest amount (and thus its thickness) between the cover slip and the slide. It is 
advisable that the entire residue is in the same plane to allow proper focus. This can be 
achieved by drying the residue either on the slide or on the cover slip before applying 
the mounting medium. A humid residue or in solution is usually not mixable with 
mounting mediums. 

Suitable mounting mediums should have ca. 1,5 refractive index. Several ones 
are available. Glycerine Jelly is very popular but it was found to be not stable after 10-
15 years, as it becomes yellow and opaque (Fatka, pers. com.). It needs sealing with nail 
varnish or another hardening product. Canada balsam is also used but it is also not 
permanent. Neo-mount from MERCK is also used, but the refractive index is slightly 
bellow 1,5. Otherwise it is very effective and does not need sealing. Entellan from 
MERCK or Entellan new is permanent and doesn’t need sealing. It is very sticky and 
viscous which makes mounting more difficult, but it can be diluted with Xylol which 
makes it more liquid and equally effective. Eukite is also used but it takes a long time 
to dry and needs the mixture of two compounds. It is not completely colourless, it’s 
slightly yellow. 

Megaspores and chitinozoa are usually mounted as specimens in especially 
prepared slides and glued or simply prepared for SEM observation.  

For this study residues were dried on cover slips (24x32mm) using a low 
temperature thermal plate and mounted in slides (26x76mm) with Entellan new, 
ensuring the entire surface is covered and removing excess resin from the edges. If by 
any chance the surface was not completed covered with resin, nail varnish can be used 
to seal the mounted slide and avoid desiccation.  

Mounting to observe with reflected light 
 A small amount of the &gt;20µ m fraction of the organic residue was placed over a 
thin 7x2cm acrylic slide and left to dry. Each slide was previously marked with the 
sample reference. When completely dry, a few drops of ethyl acetate were added, just 
enough to cover the entire slide surface. This ensures organic particles are “glued” to 
the slide and allows microscopic observation with both transmitted and reflected light – 
see below.   

2.2.13 Storage 
 Small vials or flasks, glass or plastic are appropriate for storing residues. The 
capacity will depend on the amount and concentration of the residue, but usually 20ml 
is more than enough. In the moment of storage, prior to mounting, an anti-
fungal/bacterial agent should be added. Phenol is highly toxic and thus highly effective 
(Tongeren, pers. com.). It should be used in very small amounts and with very low 
concentrations. Glycerine water is used as a storage medium and is effective at least for 
15 years (Vecoli, pers. com.). Copper Sulphate is also used in very low concentrated 
solution, adding 1 or 2 drops to the final residue (Verniers, pers. com.). 
 Low concentrated phenol (~1%) solution was dropped (less than 1ml) to every 
flask immediately after filling with residue.

2.2.14 Observation and documentation 

Transmitted light 
For this study a NIKON E600 Pol and an OLYMPUS BX-40 were used to scan 

the slides and to photograph them. With the NIKON microscope a NIKON D50 camera 
attached to an F-Mount was used to photograph slides. With the OLYMPUS BX-40 a 
OLYMPUS DP20 camera was used. 

Palynological slides can be observed in several magnifications. Eye Pieces have 
a fixed magnification and can be rotated to adjust to the observer’s dioptre level. 
Additionally they can be adjusted to a specific inter-eye distance.  
 For a general look of the slide (e.g. visual estimation of the proportion of the 
kerogen types) the 10X objective can be used, but for any observation of a particular 
specimen, the 40X must be used and for detailed observation and for photography the 
100X oil immersion objective is mandatory. 

Fig. 2 - Nikon E600Pol microscope (transmitted light) diagram and nomenclature from the user 
manual. The Olympus BX40 used in this work has a very similar structure and components. 

The light source (brightness adjuster) should always be kept near to the 
maximum. Light intensity can be adjusted with other parts. The field diagram ring
should also be kept close to maximum. Only when a big depth of field is needed this 
can be stopped down, but it will most certainly compromise the brightness. The 
condenser aperture diaphragm determines the amount of light that reaches the slide, 
the depth of field and also the contrast. When photographing, the aperture should be 
stopped to about 70 or 80% of the numerical aperture of the objective (the other number 
on the surface besides the magnification). To have increased contrast, the aperture 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

28

should be even lower. However, if the specimen is dark the brightness might be 
deteriorated, so a compromise must be achieved. 

The auto-photo switch allows that a Nomarski effect is introduced. This is 
particularly relevant to very dark and partially opaque specimens as it apparently 
increases transparency and creates a relief appearance.  
 The swing out achromatic condenser adds brightness to the field of view. This 
is important for dark specimens, but it introduces a light fringe around the specimen and 
sometimes chromatic aberration. The choice of using the condenser will depend on the 
transparency and colour of each specimen. 
 The polars (polarizer and analyzer) are most frequently set parallel, except if 
distinction between minerals and palynomorphs is necessary. Interference contrast may 
be achieved by manipulating the angle between the two. 

Reflected light 
 The acrylic slides were observed with the Olympus BX60 microscope and 
documentation done with an Olympus C3030 camera. The thin layer of ethyl acetate 
allows the observation of fine detail of palynomorphs. The classical glass slide and 
glass cover slip mounts produce significant light diffraction which precludes proper 
observation. This method was used essentially to observe and document sporomorphs, 
but acritarchs could also be observed. The most significant disadvantage is that only one 
side of palynomorphs is observable (either distal or proximal) and internal features are 
usually not discernable. The main advantage is that literally all palynomorphs of a 
residue derived from a highly mature rock can be mounted, observed and documented. 
An additional advantage (provided that microwave HF digestion was not used) is that, 
after polishing, the same slides can be used for vitrinite reflectance measurements. 

Considering the unrelenting high maturity of the Albergaria-a-Velha unit and the 
ineffectiveness of the tested oxidation techniques, this method becomes the main 
feasible way for the palynological characterization of this unit. 

2.2.15 Image processing and plates 
The images of palynomorphs obtained under the microscope are frequently 

unfocused and 2 or more microphotographs are needed to have a complete focused 
specimen. HELICON FOCUS is shareware image software that “glues” several partially 
unfocused images together to make a composite focused image without loosing or 
adding information to it. It is very user friendly and no special training is necessary. 
Many images can be glued, but the quality decreases. Two or three are best.  

Photomicrographs of selected specimens for illustration were edited to remove 
debris that could decrease plate quality. When palynomorphs and debris could not be 
positively differentiated the latter were not removed to avoid artificial alteration of 
morphological features. For scaling and measurement of specimens the software 
AXIOVISION from ZEISS was used. For plate mounting COREL DRAW was used.

2.3 Palynofacies analysis 
 For palynofacies analysis random images of unsieved residue slides were 
photographed with the 40X objective. The area occupied by the several components in 
each image was then measured using AXIOVISION software. These values were 
transferred to an Excel sheet and proportions of the several components calculated in 
order to use them in ternary diagrams, coastal proximity indices, etc. (see Chapter 3).

2.4 Conodont extraction procedure 

2.4.1 Sampling 
 Although many types of sediment contain conodont elements, only carbonate 
samples are suitable for extraction (Lindström, 1964). Limestone samples with 
bioclastic sand-sized grains were preferably chosen, especially if these were crinoidal. 
Weathered surfaces may show an irregular surface which is often indicative of the 
presence of bioclasts, but most of the times these are only recognizable after sectioning.  
 Sample weight varied from 1kg up to 5kg. When sampling a preserved 
sequence, outcrop samples were taken in regular intervals. When the limestone area was 
composed of deformed and/or metamorphosed rocks, the most suitable lithologies were 
selected, and these were often loose boulders. 

2.4.2 Cleaning and Crushing 
 Samples were cleaned with running water and brushed to remove dirt, algae and 
lichen.  
 After cleaning they were crushed to pieces of approximately chestnut size. 

2.4.3 Acetic acid dissolution 
 Crushed samples were placed in 10L plastic buckets and filled with 10% acetic 
acid. According to sample weight, 3 or 4L of 10% acetic acid was added. To enhance 
the reaction, the dilution of the acid (from glacial 100% to 10%) was done using hot 
water. The samples were left to react for a period of about 1 month after which the 
dissolved fraction smaller than 1mm was removed (see sieving). Another 3 or 4L of 
10% acetic acid was added and left to react. This step was repeated until the sample was 
completely dissolved or enough conodont elements were picked from the residue. 

2.4.4 Sieving 
 The dissolved fraction was removed from the buckets to a set of sieves with 
meshes 1mm and 125µ m. The&amp;lt;125µ m fraction was discarded. The &gt;1mm fraction was 
put back into the bucket and the intermediate fraction retained and dried. 

2.4.5 Screening and picking 
The sieved and dried residue  was thoroughly observed under a binocular 

microscope Olympus SZX-10 and conodont elements were picked using a thin iron 
spindle.  

In some samples a magnetic separation of conodonts was attempted following 
the procedure described in Dow (1960). The Franz magnetic separator available was the 
same model used in the referred paper and the parameters obtained experimentally to 
differentiate minerals by its magnetic susceptibility were very similar. The method was 
only partially successful and about half of the residue was effectively separated. 
Additionally the oxidation method described in Carls &amp;amp; Slavík (2007) was tested, but it 
was totally ineffective, producing a residue which was very difficult to segregate using 
the magnetic separator and unsuitable to observe under the binocular microscope. 

2.4.6 Observation and documentation 
 The best preserved and representative conodont elements were selected from the 
picked specimens. These were photographed with a binocular microscope before being 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

31

mounted over a double-sided sticky tape glued to a small glass slide. The arrangement 
of conodonts and its taxonomic identification (even if preliminary) was noted. The 
conodont elements were photographed using a SEM CAMECA SX 100 at the Institute 
of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The images obtained 
were used for definitive taxonomic identification and are illustrated in the appropriate 
chapter. 

2.5 Clay mineralogy 
 For the samples with little or no metamorphism, XRD analysis was performed to 
obtain palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographical information (in the case of the Buçaco 
and Santa Susana basins). The fine fraction (&lt;4µ m) was used for these samples. Some 
samples from the Covas Ruivas limestone area were also analyzed to obtain data on the 
mineralogical composition of the tuffites and limestones, but the&amp;lt;63µ m whole rock 
fraction was used.   

2.5.1 Sampling 
 Samples for the fine fraction analysis were collected from shale beds, usually 
with some striking colour (e.g. red – possible desert climate; dark grey – possible 
stagnant pond), but also from coarser sediments with obvious clayey matrix. 
 For the whole rock fraction analysis, no special care was taken and many 
samples are duplicates of conodont samples. 
 In both cases weathered and/or oxidized surfaces were avoided. 

2.5.2 Crushing and mounting 
 For both types of samples (whole rock and clay fraction), crushing was 
performed using a plastic foil around the sample and crushed with a hammer. A small 
amount of sample (ca. 100g) was used. 
 For the clay fraction samples, the crushed sediment was placed in small glass 
cups with indication of the height (in centimetres). Distilled water was added to the top 
of the cup and the mixture stirred thoroughly. Using Stokes’ law, the time that particles 
&lt;4µ m take to sink 1cm was calculated. After this time the upper centimetre was 
pipetted out to a glass slide (labelled accordingly) and left to dry. Occasionally the 
amount of sediment on the slide was not enough after the first pipetting in which case 
the procedure was repeated. 

Dark samples often contained a considerable amount of organic matter which 
can deform the diffractogram if not removed prior to mounting. For these samples, 
before decanting, 10% H2O2 was added to the crushed sample and left to react for 
several days. The 10% H2O2 was replaced several times until no reaction was observed 
and the sample was later neutralized by successive decanting.  
 For the whole rock analysis, the crushed samples was dry-sieved using a&amp;lt;63µ m 
mesh and the finer fraction diluted with distilled water and mounted on a labelled glass 
slide. 

2.5.3 Diffractometer  
 The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded with a copper anode X-ray tube (Cu-
K? radiation) using a Philips PW1710, powder diffractometer and X´Pert software PC-
APD, 3.6 at the Tropical Research Institute (IICT) Department of Natural Sciences 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

(DCN)/ Global Development (DES) in Lisbon and with a Philips X’Pert PW3040/60 
powder diffractometer with Cu-K? radiation of the Diffractometry lab at the 
Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro.
 For each sample 3 runs were performed: air dried, glycoled and heated to 500ºC. 
Although laborious this allows an appropriate identification of the minerals present and 
the determination of their proportions. In all cases a 60º 2? analysis was done. 

2.5.4 Diffractogram analysis 
 Having a diffractogram for each sample, the computer file (.rd format) was 
analyzed with PANALYTICAL software which allowed a semi-automatic peak 
determination and quantification of each mineral.  

2.6 Organic Petrology  

2.6.1 Sampling 
The sampling for organic petrology studies (metasediments) followed a similar 

procedure to the one described for palynology, without microwave digestion. Fresh, 
non-vegetated, non-mineralized, not “too deformed” outcrops were sampled. 
Considering that organic matter particles suitable for proper reflectance determination 
under the microscope should be at least 50 µ m in diameter, dark grey silty and sandy 
samples were preferably taken while shales (suitable for palynology) were avoided. 
Nevertheless many shale samples processed for palynology provided sufficiently big 
and abundant vitrinite particles to be measured. The effectiveness of this method was 
reduced because petrographic information is lost when using palynological residues. 

For the Triassic and Pennsylvanian (Buçaco and Santa Susana basins) silty and 
sandy samples with macroscopic plant remains were sampled. Coal samples were not 
collected. 

2.6.2 Sample preparation 
About 100g of metasediment cleaned sample (same standard cleaning as for 

palynology) were crushed and sieved to obtain about 10g of the&amp;lt;1mm fraction and 
about 10g of the&amp;lt;212µ m fraction. The latter fraction is assumed to be composed of 
mono-component grains, either mineral or maceral. Additionally the darker fragments 
of the&amp;lt;500 µ m fraction of silty samples were picked under a binocular microscope to a 
separate container for later mounting. 
 For the Triassic and Pennsylvanian samples the crushed samples were observed 
under a binocular microscope and plant remains (or coaly particles) were picked to a 
separate container for later mounting. 

2.6.3 HF method 
 The organic residue from the samples deriving from the Buçaco and Santa 
Susana basins (processed for palynology) was sieved with a 53µ m mesh and stored for 
later mounting. 
 Some samples from the Albergaria-a-Velha Unit were also processed with this 
method.

2.6.4 Heavy liquid separation 
 The procedure described here closely follows the one usually performed in the 
Organic Petrology Lab of the Geology Department of the Faculty of Sciences of the 
University of Porto. This step was performed only for the metasediment samples of the 
Albergaria-a-Velha unit. 
 The previously separated&amp;lt;212µ m fraction is placed in a centrifuge flask (ca. 
500ml capacity). 10g were used for most samples, but when the sample was expected to 
be poor on vitrinite particles up to 15g were used. About 200ml of bromoform diluted 
with alcohol (to obtain a liquid with ca. 1,7g/cm3 density) was added to each flask 
ensuring that each group of four samples had exactly the same weight (to be later placed 
in the centrifuge). The mixture was shaken and placed on an ultrasonic bath for 10min 
to avoid clumping of particles. 4 samples at a time were placed on a centrifuge for 
10min at a 3000rpm speed. After this step the supernatant should have a concentrate of 
organic mater and the decanted residue should be mostly mineral. 
 The supernatant is sieved using a 4cm diameter milipore filter within an 
apparatus composed of a Büchner flask attached to a vacuum pump which facilitates the 
sieving. The filter with the residue is placed over a small acrylic plate. A few drops of 
ethyl acetate are added which destroys the filter and glues the residue to the acrylic 
plate. 

Fig. 2.4 – Sieving apparatus used to concentrate the light fraction of the heavy liquid separation. 

2.6.5 Mounting and polishing 
The&amp;lt;1mm fraction of metasediments, picked dark fragments and the picked 

plant remains were mounted in Epoxy resin. The particles were placed on the bottom of 
small flexible silicon gel containers and the epoxy resin (mix of resin and hardener) 
poured into the container just enough to completely cover the particles. Gentle stirring 
with a spindle ensured that no air bubbles remained attached to the particles. A small 
piece of paper with the reference of the sample was placed on top of the resin while it 
was liquid.  



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

34

They were left to dry and harden in a lab oven at ca. 50ºC overnight. When the 
resin was completely hard, the reference of each sample was scratched with a knife on 
the back of each block to ensure correct indexation. 
 The epoxy blocks were removed from the containers and several steps of 
polishing were performed. #320 and #1000 sand paper were used in turn washing the 
block between each step. Some samples required an intermediate or final polishing step 
using the #500 and #4000 sand papers respectively. 
 The acrylic plates with the residue were gently polished over a glass surface 
using the #600 and #1200 SiC wet powders. 
 All samples had a final polish using a PlanoPol rotating disk machine over a fine 
tissue plate with 0,3µ m and 0,05µ m sized alumina abrasive gel.   

All samples were examined under a reflected light microscope between each 
polishing stage and checked for important scratches or irregular surface areas and re-
polished if necessary. 

2.6.6 Observation and measurement 
 All polished samples were observed and measured with a reflected light 
microscope Leitz ORTHOPLAN. Measurements were obtained with the image analysis 
software FOSSIL and DISKUS. The software produced an EXCEL file and a histogram 
as the measurements were being made. 

2.7 Thin sections 

2.7.1 Sampling 
 For metasediments associated to the Porto-Tomar shear zone, coarse silt and 
sand sized samples were collected, avoiding significant weathering, mineralization and 
preferably choosing outcrops were bedding was preserved and sedimentary features 
were observable. Additional samples of fine siltstones and shales were collected to fully 
characterize turbidite beds or other specific sedimentary features. 
 For limestones of the Southern part of the Ossa-Morena zone, samples without 
significant mineralization and veining and relatively fresh were chosen. Samples with 
visible or suspected sand sized or coarser bioclasts (in weathered surfaces) were 
preferably chosen as these usually allow the identification of macrofossils either in thin 
section or polished sections.  
 Additional samples were taken from tuffites and cherts from the Odivelas 
Limestone localities for petrographic description and to determine the presence of some 
microfossils (radiolarians and tentaculites).  

2.7.2 Sample preparation 
All samples were cut in the LabPol of the Geology Department of the Faculty of 

Sciences of the University of Lisbon. The standard size is 31x23mm with a thickness of 
20mm. Thin sections are produced with a final thickness of 0.02mm by a specialized 
technician.

2.7.3 Observation, measurements and documentation 
Thin sections were observed in several binocular and petrographic microscopes. 

Sedimentary features, identification of bioclasts, quantification of the several types of 
particles present and other features were noted. When necessary, photographs were 
taken, always in digital format. The methods used to count particles and plot the results 
are described and discussed in the appropriate section of Chapter 3. 

2.8 Polished sections/surfaces 

2.8.1 Sampling 
 Several types of lithologies were sampled. Most of the samples collected were 
processed both for thin and polished sections. Samples were usually 10x10cm or bigger.  

2.8.2 Sample preparation 
 Samples were initially cut at a specific angle either to allow maximum 
observation area and/or to have sections parallel or perpendicular to bedding, depending 
on the desired objective. Selected sections were then polished in 2 steps, the first with a 
rotating plate and wet #400 SiC powder and the second over a still glass surface with 
#600 or #800 SiC powder. This produced a surface with a matte shine and not glossy, 
thus appropriate for observation and photography.  

2.8.3 Observation and documentation 
 The polished sections were observed with naked eye and with a binocular 
microscope and details of sedimentary features, identification of bioclasts and other 
characteristics noted. The whole surface of the sections and some details were 
photographed in a small studio.

Abstract
 The Albergaria-a-Velha Unit is one of the several tectonostratigraphic out-of-
sequence units of the metamorphic belt associated with the Porto-Tomar strike-slip shear 
zone. It is composed by considerably deformed metasediments, namely shales, siltstones 
and rare fine sandstones. The sedimentological, stratigraphical and palynological data 
suggest that the Albergaria-a-Velha Unit was deposited from the (?)Early Frasnian to the 
Serpukovian in a distal marine environment, where turbiditic and basinal sedimentation 
prevailed, adjacent to a deltaic system. The collected data also suggests a gradual increase

of terrestrial input, indicating a prograding system. Detrital framework data points to a 
stable cratonic sediment source area composed by low grade metamorphic rocks. This unit 
is within the dry gas window in terms of hydrocarbon generation ranges.

3.1 Introduction

3.1.1 Geological setting 
 The Iberian massif, in its northwestern region, is transected by a NNW-SSE major 
dextral deep-crustal shear zone, separating the Ossa-Morena Zone – OMZ (to East) and 
the Central Iberian Zone – CIZ (to West) (Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé et al., 2003, 2007; 
Dias &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Gama Pereira, 1987). This shear zone (Porto-Tomar shear zone – 
PTSZ) comprises a narrow metamorphic belt that extends from Tomar area (western 
central Portugal) (Gama Pereira, 1987) to South of Porto area (NW Portugal) (Chaminé, 
2000; Chaminé et al., 2003, 2007; Pereira et al., 1998). The inclusion of this metamorphic 
belt in the OMZ has been assumed by most authors based on some lithological and 
chronological similarities between units of the PTSZ and units of the southern part of the 
OMZ, especially along other shear zones (Chaminé, 2000). Recently a revised 
interpretation of the geodynamic evolution of the Iberian variscides refers a Finisterra 
affinity for the metamorphic belt associated with the PTSZ (Ribeiro et al., 2007). The 
general dextral sense movement of this shear zone was considered to have started during 
the “Westphalian”, based on the evident tectonosedimentary control of the Pennsylvanian 
Buçaco basin (e.g. Lefort &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1980; Ribeiro et al., 1980; Gama Pereira et al., 2008; 
Pinto de Jesus et al., 2010), but was reinterpreted using structural data from the CIZ, as 
being already active during the early stages of the Variscan orogeny by Dias &amp;amp; Ribeiro 
(1993). The post-Mesozoic geodynamic evolution of Iberia has been dominated by 
reactivating inherited crustal structures, which induce stress activity of the Porto-Tomar 
fault zone segments since the end of the Variscan orogeny until the present-day (e.g., 
Gomes et al., 2007; Gomes, 2008; Vicente &amp;amp; Vega, 2009). 
 This metamorphic belt comprises several relative autochthonous and 
parautochthonous tectonostratigraphic units with high to very low metamorphic degrees, 
as well as allochthonous units of medium to high metamorphic degrees (Severo 
Gonçalves, 1974; Gama Pereira, 1987, 1998; Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé et al., 2003a,b, and 
references there in). The substratum of this belt comprises a Late Proterozoic unit 
(Beetsma, 1995) composed by black, grey and greenish phyllites and amphibolites 
(Chaminé, 2000, Fernández et al., 2003) – Arada unit and its equivalents further South to 
the region of Coimbra and Tomar (Chaminé et al., 2003; Gama Pereira, 1987). The 
Albergaria-a-Velha Late Paleozoic very-low black metasediments was initially reported 
by Chaminé (2000) and later proposed the Albergaria-a-Velha unit (AVU) by Chaminé et 
al. (2000). This is one of the several tectonostratigraphic out-of-sequence units of Porto–
Coimbra–Tomar metamorphic belt. This metapelitic unit is tectonically imbricated with 
the Arada unit and its metapelitic equivalents further South to the region of Coimbra and 
Tomar (Gama Pereira, 1998; Chaminé et al., 2003a,b), unit making the cartographic 
differentiation of the two units extremely difficult. The AVU has been dated by Fernandes 
et al. (2001) and subsequently by Chaminé et al. (2003, 2007) as being Givetian-Frasnian 
to “Namurian” in age, using miospores. The thermal history of this unit has been 
investigated by Moço et al. (2001) and Chaminé et al. (2003) using vitrinite reflectance 
data, indicating a relatively low maturity, within catagenesis. The examination of 
phyllosilicate crystallographic parameters from this unit indicated higher palaeo-

temperatures and pressures, ranging the high anchizone – epizone, i.e., maximum 
temperatures &gt;200ºC and pressures between 1 and 2 Kbar (Chaminé et al., 2003; Vázquez, 
et al., 2007). The AVU is overlaid unconformably by Late Triassic sediments of the 
Lusitanian basin (Grés de Silves Fm.) (Corboulieux, 1974; Palain, 1976), but not by the 
sediments of the Pennsylvanian Buçaco Basin. These contact the AVU by faults and both 
are overlain unconformably by the Grés de Silves Fm. (Ribeiro, 1853). 
 This work is a further contribution to the biostratigraphy (using palynology) and to 
the stratigraphical and sedimentological characterization of the AVU. The source rock 
potential and thermal history of this unit are also addressed.

3.1.2 Factors controlling palynomorph preservation in 
metasediments and its application to the study of the AVU 

3.1.2.1 Nature and characteristics of palynomorphs  
Due to the solubility of the mineral substances that make up most macrofossils and 

microfossils, they are very frequently absent or dramatically modified in sedimentary 
rocks that have been subjected to metamorphism. The main variables involved are 
temperature and pressure which are often associated with deformation and fluid 
circulation. Palynomorphs have sizes from a few micrometers (small acritarchs) up to a 
few hundreds of micrometers (larger chitinozoans and megaspores). The wall is composed 
of different organic substances according to their nature. It is usually very resistant to 
abrasion, breakage and can maintain its overall shape in a wide range of temperatures and 
pressures, showing a gradual and irreversible darkening with temperature. (e.g. Yule et al., 
1998, 1999, 2000). Palynomorphs are found in rocks from the Precambrian (first 
acritarchs) up to recent. They are usually obtained by maceration of sedimentary rocks 
(HCl + HF attacks) and mounting of the organic residue on a microscopy slide. They can 
also be observed in thin sections, but this is done only when the organic wall has been 
replaced by mineral matter or when fragmentation precludes taxonomic identification in 
an organic residue observation. 

3.1.2.2 Relevant Geological Variables 

Sedimentation and diagenetic factors 
Due to their size and hydrodynamic characteristics palynomorphs tend to be 

concentrated in pelitic sediments (e.g. Traverse, 2007). Coarser grained rocks may provide 
palynomorphs but usually in a much lower quantity and quality. Carbonates rarely provide 
good palynological assemblages (e.g. Wicander and Wright, 1983) due to the alkalinity of 
their sedimentation setting and usual low concentration of organic matter (Gehman, 1962; 
Traverse, 2007). Anoxic and dysoxic environments during both sedimentation and 
diagenesis favor organic matter preservation and thus of palynomorphs (Traverse, 2007; 
Tiwari et al., 1994). An extensive discussion with examples of the effects of physical 
variables during deposition and diagenesis is given in Tiwari et al. (1994). 

Temperature and pressure 
With increasing temperature and pressure palynomorphs progressively and 

irreversibly change colour and loose transparency. The effect of lithostatic pressure has 
been shown to retard organic maturation, but its effect is drastically reduced over 1Kbar 
(Sajgo et al.; 1986; SenGupta, 1975). 

For the most mature and metamorphosed spores, little differentiation can be made 
as they reach a black and transmitted-light-opaque stage. They become more brittle and 
are thus more easily broken by deformation but their overall shape is frequently preserved 
and taxonomic identification is possible using strong oxidizing agents or SEM observation 
(e.g. Traverse, 2007). 

Acritarchs respond differently and thin walled ones can remain translucent up to 
low-grade metamorphic conditions after which they start to disaggregate (especially when 
associated with deformation) and frequently produce skeletal structures with relicts of 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

44

their original ornamentation (Fig. 3.2). Thick walled acritarchs become dark in a similar 
way as spores and are destroyed in the same way as thin walled acritarchs.  

Chitinozoans are probably the most resistant palynomorphs. They can be partially 
preserved as graphitized particles in mylonitic gneisses with estimated peak temperatures 
between 300 and 500ºC (Hanel et al., 1999). In all of these cases palynomorphs still 
provide useful palaeoenvironmental data and in some cases crude biostratigraphical 
bracketing.

Fig. 3.2 - Example of partially destroyed thin-walled ?prasinophytes from a Frasnian highly deformed 
metasediment comprised in the AVU. 

Compaction and Deformation 
Compaction due to lithostatic pressure, especially in shales, causes flattening and 

consequent folding of the wall of palynomorphs (e.g. Clayton, 1972). Due to their elastic 
wall, the overall shape and ornamentation is usually preserved. Sedimentary rocks and 
their fossil content preserve most of their characteristics when subjected to gentle folding 
and minor faulting. Other deformation features such as penetrative foliation, grain 
boundary sliding, closely packed folding and bedding-parallel shear movement can 
destroy the entire macrofossil content and a significant part of the millimetre-sized 
microfossils.  Due to their minute size and organic wall, palynomorphs can be preserved 
even in metasediments with millimetre scale foliation and closely packed kink folds. This 
is frequently observed in the AVU (Fig.3.3).

and a real case of a deformed and metamorphosed rock that provided both acritarchs and spores. A -

metasediment that provided moderately preserved palynomorphs



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

45

Fluid circulation and mineralization 
It is widely known among palynologists and organic petrologists that oxidation 

(positive Eh values), resulting either from weathering, diagenesis or metamorphism alters 
or destroys organic-matter (e.g. Tiwari et al., 1994). Metasediments that have extensive 
mineralization or veining with oxides are almost invariably barren. On the other hand 
exceptionally preserved palynomorphs can be found in pisolitic ironstones, in both matrix 
and pisoliths (Vavrdová, 1999). Sulphide mineralization, when restricted to veins or not 
completely replacing the host rock has a milder effect. Palynomorphs frequently have 
pyrite crystals growing inside of the wall or attached to the processes, but are generally 
preserved (Fig.3.2). 

Silicification in early diagenesis stages can actually increase the fossilization 
potential of palynomorphs preserving them in their original 3D form as observed in the 
Rhynie chert. Silicification (either extensive or veining) in late diagenesis and during 
metamorphism usually decreases the preservation quality, but it is usually not a 
determining factor, except when there is a significant replacement of the host rock by 
silica. Samples of Upper Devonian black shales with mm-thick quartz veins and very near 
to thick (ca. 50cm) quartz + complex carbonates ± pyrite ± chalcopyrite ± dickite/kaolinite 
veins (Chaminé, 2000; Chaminé et al., 2003) were equally as fossiliferous as samples 
from the same locality with no mineralization, although more undissolved minerals 
remained after HF attack. 

Fig. 3.4 - Fossiliferous black shale samples affected by mineralization.

It is difficult or even impossible to determine well defined limits of physical and 
chemical variables under which palynomorphs are preserved. In the case of the AVU 
sediments exposed to temperatures higher than 200ºC and pressures up to 2Kbar (Vázquez 
et al., 2007) provide diversified and moderately preserved palynomorphs that allow 
biostratigraphical bracketing to the stage level and sound palaeoenvironmental 
determinations. Strong deformation and some types of mineralization have a limited 
detrimental effect on the quality of the assemblages. The more deformed and heated, the 
worse the quality of the microfossils, but at least in some cases palynomorphs can be 
preserved in mylonitic gneisses exposed to temperatures between 300 and 500ºC and  
which still provide useful sedimentary and stratigraphical information (Hanel et al., 1999).

The potential of many metasedimentary units around the World is probably greater 
than currently considered by many palynologists and geologists. Although laborious and 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

46

sometimes unsuccessful, palynological processing of metasediments can provide 
information that would otherwise be unattainable.  

3.2 Materials and methods 

3.2.1 Stratigraphy 
A few short undeformed sequences can be observed, up to ca. 24m thick in 

localities FON (3 sections – Espinho-Albergaria-a-Velha sub-sector), MON (1 section – 
Buçaco-Luso sub-sector) and BOS (1 section - Botão-Miranda do Corvo sub-sector) – see 
Fig. 3.1 and Appendix 1 for locations. These were logged and sampled for palynology, 
thin sections and polished surfaces to observe relevant sedimentary features. All other 
known localities may have a few relatively undeformed beds, but are invariably bounded 
by faults and are usually folded, making it impossible properly describe and interpret the 
sequence.

3.2.2 Provenance 
The application of quantified modal compositions of sandstones to the study of 

provenance of sediments and geodynamic setting started with the seminal work of 
Dickinson (1970) and was later developed and refined by Basu et al. (1975) and Dickinson 
&amp;amp; Suczek (1979). Using the modal composition of sandstones from well-known and 
constrained geodynamic settings, they defined several fields of characteristic compositions 
in Quartz-Feldspar-Lithic fragments ternary diagrams. The method has been successfully 
used in several marine settings (e.g. Valloni &amp;amp; Maynard, 1981; Valloni, 1985; Packer &amp;amp; 
Ingersoll, 1986) and also with fluvial sandstones (e.g. Arribas &amp;amp; Arribas, 1991. Ingersoll, 
1990; Garzanti et al., 2004; Pera &amp;amp; Arribas, 2004). This method is particularly useful to 
study ancient sedimentary rocks and metasediments, when the source areas and most of 
the evidences of the plate-tectonic setting prevailing during their deposition are not 
available or cannot be directly inferred (Bhatia, 1983). This is clearly the case of the AVU. 

Fig. 3.5 – Classification scheme for sandstones. Adapted from Prothero &amp;amp; Schwab (1996). 

The AVU is composed essentially by pelitic metasediments. Fine sand-sized rocks 
are generally rare, but are available is some areas, at the base of turbidite beds. The 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

47

samples used in this work derive from such beds from localities FON (1 sample – 
Espinho-Albergaria-a-Velha sector); MON (1 sample, Buçaco-Luso sub-sector); ALH and 
CND (3 samples - Águeda sub-sector); BOS, QUI and ZOR (4 samples – Botão-Miranda 
do Corvo sub-sector) – see Fig. 3.1 for locations and Appendix 1 for details.
 The samples were thin sectioned preferentially parallel to bedding in order to 
obtain a homogenous grain size within the thin section. The grain packing index (i) (Kahn, 
1956) was determined using the following equation: 

D
L

Nc
i

Where Nc is the number of grain-grain contacts along the length (L) and D the 
average grain diameter. Samples were classified using the classification scheme in Fig. 
3.5.

300 particles were counted in each thin section using a semi-automated Swift point 
counter coupled to a Leitz Orthoplan microscope. Observation and counting were 
performed with crossed polars. The Gazzi-Dickinson counting method was used (Gazzi, 
1966 in Ingersoll et al., 1984). Particles smaller than 0,00625mm (silt-sized and smaller) 
were counted as matrix. Recrystallization of the matrix, the presence of metamorphic 
minerals and also silicification were observable in some samples which often made 
difficult the recognition of individual grains. Grains of doubtful origin (probably 
metamorphic or from matrix recrystallization) were not considered. For quantification 
purposes, the Gazzi-Dickinson method considers the mineral of a polymineralic particle 
(lithic fragment) and not the lithic fragment itself, except where the grain-size of the lithic 
fragment is smaller than fine-sand (see Fig.3.6). Naturally the proportion of lithic 
fragments is reduced when compared with the classical method which does not 
discriminate minerals within lithic fragments. It does, however, reduce the effect of 
variable grain size which is often the case in sandstones. The following table summarizes 
the several categories of grains counted and some of their main characteristics.  

Grains Code Main features 
Quartzose monocrystalline Qm Fresh, commonly with undulatory extinction pattern 
Quartzose polycrystalline Qp Mostly chert grains, minor fine-grained quartzites 

Plagioclase P Typically slightly weathered and small. Characteristic polysynthetic twinning

Lithoclasts were initially differentiated according to their nature (volcanic, 
sedimentary and metamorphic) but the reduced number of grains and their cryptic nature 
did not allow the desired differentiation. The results were plotted in ternary diagrams and 
compared with the previously defined plots (Dickinson &amp;amp; Suczek, 1979 and Dickinson et 
al., 1983) using Grapher 4.0 software. 

The number of undulatory and non-undulatory quartz grains and also the number 
of crystals of each polymineralic quartz grain were counted using the parameters defined 
in Basu et al. (1975). The counts were made on successive randomly chosen fields of 
view, counting all the grains greater than 0,0125mm. Due to the low grade metamorphism 
and deformation, only 5 samples were suitable for this analysis. The results were plotted 
in a diamond diagram using the fields proposed by Basu et al. (1975) as indicators of rock 
types in the source areas.

monomineralic grains and lithic fragments and theoretical consequences of fragmentation. B –

3.2.3 Palynology and Palynofacies 
Several hundreds of dark grey and black shale and siltstone samples were 

collected. Of these about 250 were processed for palynology using the methods described 
in Chapter 2. Most of the processed samples produced considerable amounts of organic 
residue, but only about 100 had observable palynomorphs (called here productive 
samples). The slides produced from the productive residues were observed in transmitted 
light microscopes. Documentation of observable palynomorphs was conducted using a 
digital camera apparatus attached to the microscope. Selected productive residues were 
mounted in acrylic plates, air-dried and observed (and photographed) using a reflected 
light microscope (see Chapter 2). 

The term palynofacies was introduced by Combaz (1964) and the concept has been 
successfully used for palaeoenvironmental interpretations and source rock assessment 
since then (see Batten, 1996a, b; Traverse, 2007 and Tyson, 1987, 1993 for revision of 
methods and applications). Palynofacies is based on the study, usually quantified, of 
particulate organic matter (or palynological matter) obtained by maceration of sedimentary 
rocks (Traverse, 2007; Tyson, 1993), as observed under transmitted light microscopy. The 
relative and absolute percentages of land- and marine-derived palynomorphs provide 
valuable information for the determination of sedimentary facies. Similarly the 
quantification of oil- and gas-prone organic particles allows a rapid and semi-quantitative 
assessment of source rocks. 
 Due to the generally poor quality of the organic residues obtained from the AVU 
the palynofacies analysis was limited to a few fundamental categories of palynomorphs. 
About 30 samples of known age were used. For each sample, two types of analysis were 
performed:

slides. Compiled from Tyson 1987, 1993; Miller, 1996 and Batten 1996a, b. 

Other approaches to palynofacies analysis such as the differentiation of long- and 
short-spined acritarchs and spore morpho groups were not attempted as the studied 
palynomorphs were probably preferentially preserved or destroyed by metamorphism and 
deformation.  

Most categories can be easily recognized under transmitted light microscopy. 
Chitinozoans and zooclasts were grouped because their differentiation is often difficult 
due to the considerable maturity of the organic matter. Phytoclasts could be differentiated 
in most instances by their overall morphology, but smaller and heavily-degraded particles 
were sometimes doubtfully assigned to this category, although they could also be 
classified as degraded zooclasts. Thus there is an inherent uncertainty associated with this 
method. 

3.2.4 Organic geochemistry and vitrinite reflectance 
Twelve selected samples were analyzed by Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis. The samples 

were gently pulverized, homogenized and sieved through a 1 mm mesh. All samples were 
subjected to elemental analysis of total organic and inorganic carbon (TOC, TIC, 
respectively) using an Eltra Metalyt CS 100/1000S apparatus at the Organic Geochemistry 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

50

lab of the Czech Geological Survey (Brno). The Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis (Espitalié et al. 
1985, Lafargue et al. 1998) was carried out in nitrogen at a programmed temperature of 
300-550 °C with heating rate of 25 °C/min. Several organic geochemical parameters were 
obtained, namely S1 – free hydrocarbons (mg HC/g rock); S2 – bound (pyrolytic) 
hydrocarbons (mg HC/g rock); pyrogenic CO2 and CO (S3) and peak temperature of 
pyrolysis (Tmax); HI – hydrogen index (mg HC/g TOC) and OI – oxygen index (mg CO2/g 
TOC).
 Heavy liquid concentrates and selected palynological residues obtained by cold HF 
dissolution of mineral matter were mounted using the methods described in Chapter 2. 
Both types of residues were observed under a microscope Leitz ORTHOPLAN. (reflected 
light) of the Organic Petrology lab of the Geology Department of the Faculty of Sciences 
of the University of Porto. Reflectance measurements and photomicrographs were 
obtained with the image analysis software FOSSIL and DISKUS. 

3.3 Results 

3.3.1 Stratigraphy, Sedimentology and facies 
The AVU is composed of several dispersed outcrops of pelitic metasediments and 

rare fine sandstones. Most of the sedimentary information is obliterated by an intense 
deformation and very low to low grade metamorphism. Due to the different rheologic 
behaviour of lithologies to deformation, most of the sedimentary information is preserved 
on siltstones and sandstones while shales seldom allow the observation of sedimentary 
structures. This difference is visible at the outcrop scale, down to millimetre scale, as 
observed in thin sections. Outcrops dominated by shales or fine siltstones are consistently 
heavily deformed. Original bedding and fine lamination are occasionally observed as S0
surfaces between S1 (foliation) penetrative surfaces.

The sand/mud ratio varies greatly, but seems to be fairly similar within a group of 
outcrops over areas of few Km2. This ratio was visually estimated for localities and groups 
of outcrops. It is typically between 30%/70% to 20%/80% and the total average is close to 
30%/70%. The longest preserved sequences are sandstone- (and sometimes siltstone-) 
dominated and thus have a higher-than-average ratio.  

Very rare cm-thick oil shale beds can be observed in some sections dominated by 
shales (and more rarely also siltstones and fine sandstones). More commonly the same 
type (presumably) of oil shales is found within fault gauges. 

During the course of this work not a single macrofossil or trace fossil was found, 
despite a persistent and systematic search in every outcrop with preserved sedimentary 
features. The chances of finding fossils at a macroscopic scale are considerably reduced by 
the metamorphism and deformation of this unit.  

The vast majority of non-weathered outcrops had rocks of light to dark grey or 
black colour. Notable exceptions are some, but not all, siltstone and fine sandstone beds, 
which had yellow to light brown colours.

Considering the localities where sedimentary information can be obtained, three 
main lithofacies can be defined. These should be, however, considered end members of a 
range. The main characteristics are defined in table 3.5. The laminated grey shale facies is 
very commonly observed and can be recognized even with considerably deformed rocks, 
as the striking contrast of light grey and dark grey mm-thick laminae is often preserved. 
The lamination is defined by darker and finer laminae alternating with lighter and slightly 
coarser laminae. This is observed at hand sample and thin section scales (Pl. 3.16F, G).

Table 3.4 – Visual estimates of sand/mud ratio in several localities and groups of outcrops. Localities 

are listed roughly from North to South. 

 The black shale facies can be found in localities such as VAL, ASS, SER, AUT 
and LOB which are entirely composed by shales (Pl. 3.17B) with an extremely reduced 
fine siltstone component. Pyrite is frequently observed in these and other shale-dominated 
localities. Lamination is faint and only seldom seen between very penetrative foliation 
planes.
 Of all the studied localities, only five sections showed a deformation degree that 
allowed the description of relatively continuous stratigraphic sequences and the 
examination of details of sedimentary features. All of them are bounded by faults which 
do not allow the recognition of the sequence between the two sides of the fault. All can be 
included in the sand-silt-shale lithofacies. Three of these sections are at the Fontão 
locality, Espinho - Albergaria-a-Velha sub-sector (FON – see Fig.3.1), along road cuts 
between the village of Angeja and Fontão and are Serpukovian in age; one at Monsarros 
(locality MON2 – see Fig.3.1), Luso-Buçaco sub sector, also Serpukovian in age and one 
at Bostelim (locality BOS2 – see Fig.3.1), Botão – Miranda do Corvo sub sector, age 
unknown.

environment.

 At Fontão, sections FON I and FON G are composed by dm- to m-thick (rarely 
cm-thick) successive beds of fining-upward cycles. Most beds are composed dominantly 
by siltstones that fine up to shales, but some fine sandstone-dominated beds also occur. 
These beds typically have a coarser, massive or crudely bedded base and a finer laminated 
top. Occasionally cross-beds can be observed in a cm- to mm-thick intermediate interval. 
These correspond to parts a ± b ± c + d ± e of Bouma sequences (Bouma, 1962). 
Generally thicker beds are also coarser, but some thin beds have relatively coarse beds 
(fine sandstones). Within these two sections, some intervals are composed solely of very 
fine siltstone and shales (e.g. 5,5 to 8m at FON I and 3 to 4m at FON G) and no 
granulometric differences can be distinguished macroscopically within each bed, but 
analogous fining-upward cycles may be present at a smaller scale. Alternatively these 
shale dominated intervals can represent basinal deposition occurring between turbidity 
current events (level e of Bouma sequences). 

Some general fining and coarsening-upward cycles can be distinguished at the 
meter scale, but these trends do not seem to be associated with any other sedimentological 
variation.

These two sections are interpreted as successive low density turbidite beds. The 
variations in thicknesses and granulometry can be explained by the magnitude of the 
turbidity event that originated each bed, the position of the sedimentation area in relation 
to the source area and the granulometry of the sediment available at the source area.

Fig. 7 – Lithological columns of the Fontão (FON) locality. 

Section FON N is similar to FON I and FON G and many of its beds can also be 
interpreted as low-density turbidites. However the section is generally finer grained and 
the fining-upward cycles are not as well defined and some beds even show inverted 
grading. Additionally some siltstone beds do not show significant changes in 
granulometry and lack the massive - cross bed - laminated sequence observed elsewhere. 
This type of succession of dm-thick fine sandstone and siltstone beds associated with thin 
shale beds (occasionally even mm-thick oil shale beds) can be observed in a nearby 
locality (ANG – see Fig.3.1) and possibly in other localities where deformation precludes 
detailed observation of the sedimentology. This section is interpreted as succession of low 
density turbidite beds deposited in a considerably distal setting interbedded with basinal 
sediments represented by the shale dominated intervals, but can also represent pro-delta 
deposits not necessarily associated with turbidity currents. 

The Monsarros 2 section shows a sequence of siltstone-dominated turbidite beds 
with fairly regular thicknesses, although some very fine fining-upward cycles can be 
observed (ca. 9m). Cross bedding is seldom observed, although this feature may be 
obscured by the substantial oxidation of this section. Most beds correspond to levels a and 
d of Bouma sequences. Level e (shales at the top of each cycle) is very poorly developed 
in this sequence.

Fig. 8 - Lithological columns of the Monsarros  (MON2) and Bostelim (BOS) locality. 

 The Bostelim 2 (BOS) section is the coarsest sequence observed in all known AVU 
outcrops. At least in one of the cycles the base is defined by an erosive surface. The 
fining-upward cycles are dm- to m-thick and commonly have medium to coarse sand-
grained bases that grade to siltstones and more rarely shales. Some thinner beds can be 
observed (Pl. 3.16D). Fairly complete Bouma sequences can be observed, with a thick 
coarse massive base (level a), a crudely to well bedded interval of medium sands (level b), 
cross laminated sands (level c) and parallel laminated siltstone top (level d). Shales are 
seldom present at the top of cycles. Palynological samples from this locality were barren. 

3.3.2 Detrital framework analysis and provenance 
 The absence of coarse-grained metasediments in the AVU precludes the direct and 
precise identification of transported lithologies and thus the interpretation of the source 
areas.  

The collected point-counting data set shows that samples are all wackes, either 
quartz, sublithic or subarkose wackes, due to their high matrix/cement contents. The 
arenites have high matrix/cement contents, between 18 and 47%. The original dataset used 
by Dickinson &amp;amp; Suczek (1979) included only samples with matrix/cement proportion less 
than 25% which can limit the significance of the collected data. 

Quartzose grains, both mono- and polymineralic, dominate all analysed 
frameworks. Most were monomineralic quartz grains, ranging from 64 to 95% of all 
grains. Undulatory extinction was commonly observed, although the extinction pattern 
differed between grains, suggesting that the deformation episode that originated the 
undulatory extinction affected the units in the source areas and not the AVU itself. 
Quartzite grains were frequently observed (but counted as monomineralic grains following 
the methodology described above). Cherts grains are also frequently observed. Feldspars 
s.l. are quite rare (0 to 3,3%), considerably smaller than other grains and frequently 
weathered. Plagioclase is the most common feldspar s.l.. Lithic fragments (excluding Qp) 
are usually rare, ranging from 0 to 6%. These are in most instances black

cryptocrystalline, occasionally with very small mica crystals. They may be volcanic 
derived lithoclasts, but their true nature is uncertain.

All the analyzed samples contained a dominant proportion of undulatory quartz 
(sensu Basu et al., 1975), from 58 to 67%. The proportions of non-undulatory quartz and 
polycrystalline quartz varied (between 10 and 27%), but in most cases, the latter was more 
frequent than the former.

Among polycrystalline quartz grains, the ones with 3 or more crystal units per 
grain were clearly dominant, (between 73 and 90%), corresponding to chert (s.l.) grains 
and more rarely to very-fine quartzite grains.

Apart from the undulosity, there were no relevant petrographic differences between 

undulose and non-undulose quartz grains. These were characteristically fresh, with 
variable roundness: from very angulose to well rounded, typically sub-angulose or sub-
rounded (Pl. 3.17C, D). One single sample group is visible in the diamond plot of Basu et 
al. (1975) (Fig.3.10), plotting within the low rank metamorphic field. This is in 
accordance with the composition of the lithoclastic component of the frameworks which 
was dominated by chert and quartzite grains.

3.3.3. Palynofacies 
 The palynofacies analysis allowed the graphical representation of the several 
categories and group of categories in ternary plots and bi-dimensional plots with a time 
axis. 

Fig. 3.11 – Ternary Tyson diagram showing the distribution of selected samples from the AVU 
according to their palynological content. Base diagram adapted from Tyson (1993). 

 The Tyson diagram shows a single sample group plotting near the AOM vertex, 
corresponding to the distal suboxic-anoxic basin and distal dysoxic-oxic shelf fields. 
There is little differentiation between samples according to their age. Nevertheless there is 
a badly defined trend away from the AOM vertex from older to younger samples. This 
corresponds to an increase in the proportion of palynomorphs (spores and organic-walled 
microplankton) and to a lesser extent an increase of phytoclast content. Frasnian samples 
plot closely together, very near the AOM vertex. Palynomorphs are observable but are 
statistically irrelevant. Phytoclasts are extremely rare. Famennian-Tournaisian samples are 
concentrated very close to the AOM vertex, but extend into the distal dysoxic-oxic shelf 
field. This is mainly due to the presence of acritarchs and prasinophytes (even though 
highly fragmented) up to 13% in some samples. Spores are also frequent, but never as 
common as acritarchs and prasinophytes. Viséan samples are dispersed, with some 
plotting very near the AOM vertex (AOM around 90%) while others plot within the distal 
dysoxic-oxic shelf field, corresponding to samples with higher palynomorph or phytoclast 
content. Serpukovian samples are also dispersed, but can be separated in two groups, one 
within the distal dysoxic-oxic shelf field, corresponding to samples with higher spore 
content (up to 17%) and another plotting near the AOM vertex. The second group can also 
be identified in the terrestrial-marine palynomorphs Vs age and spore-organic-walled 
microplankton Vs age plots (Figs. 3.12 and 3.13).

Ages compiled from Time Scale Creator software (Geologic Time Scale 2004). 

 Similarly to the Tyson diagram, the palynofacies analysis of the sieved residues 
shows some dispersal of data, but some trends are observable. The terrestrial-marine 
palynomorphs Vs age and spore-organic-walled microplankton Vs age plots (Figs. 3.12 
and 3.13) show a progressive and irregular increase of terrestrial palynomorphs’ content 
form older to younger samples. Frasnian samples show some dispersal of data, but both 
organic-walled microplankton and total marine palynomorphs are dominant. This reflects 
the dominance of highly fragmented acritarchs in the residues, over the spores. 
Lithologically all Frasnian samples correspond to grey shales, often finely laminated. 
Famennian-Tournaisian samples cover a wide range of proportions in both plots, but most 
samples show a higher proportion of spores and total terrestrial palynomorphs. This 
reflects the general abundance of spores in the residues of this age. It should be 
mentioned, however, that some residues were particularly rich in acritarchs and 
occasionally also in prasinophytes. Both types of residues (spore- and acritarch-rich) 
correspond to black shale lithologies.

 Viséan samples are characterized by the abundance of spores in sieved residues. 
Phytoclasts become more frequent. This is reflected in both plots, where single sample 
groups are observed, around the 90% spores and 75% terrestrial palynomorph axes. 
Lithologically Viséan samples correspond to grey shales and some highly deformed silt-
shale outcrops (possibly turbidites?). Serpukovian samples are divided in two groups, 
similarly to the Tyson diagram. One shows similar characteristics to the Viséan samples; 
with high spore contents and generally high content of terrestrial palynomorphs 
(phytoclasts are relatively frequent). It corresponds to the sand-silt-shale beds, interpreted 
as turbidites. The second group has a relatively high content of organic walled 
microplankton, few spores and very rare phytoclasts. Organic-walled microplankton 
seems to correspond to simple polygonomorphs and very small prasinophytes, although 
identification is difficult as specimens are highly fragmented. Lithologically these samples 
correspond to black shales, apparently identical to the Famennian-Tournaisian ones. 

Fig. 3.14 – Prasinophyte/acritarch ratio Vs Age plot.  Error bars on Y-axis based on the uncertainty of 
the biostratigraphical determination of each sample. Ages compiled from Time Scale Creator software 

(Geologic Time Scale 2004). 

 The prasinophyte/acritarch ratio Vs age plot has limited statistical significance as 
many samples had very few organic-walled microplankton specimens that could be 
positively identified as belonging to one group. Samples plotting along the 0% axis 
indicate that either acritarch or prasinophyte counts were 0. Generally acritarchs seem to 
be more common than prasinophytes, although some samples, especially Famennian and 
Tournaisian ones have residues where prasinophytes are particularly abundant. Samples 
from one locality, SOB, (not used for this quantification) had abundant and moderate to 
well preserved prasinophytes (especially Cymatiosphaera spp. and Dictyotidium spp.) and 
virtually no acritarchs. 

3.3.4 Palynology  
The palynological content is invariably heavily matured, although the maturity 

seems to be considerably variable. In at least two localities, the spores are translucent with 
grey hues. For the remaining localities spores are generally black and opaque, although 
some thin walled ones retain some translucency. The organic residue was composed, in 
most instances, by semi-translucent dark grey to black AOM with subordinate amounts of 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

60

sporomorphs and acritarchs (s.l.), which were very often fragmented and unsuitable for 
taxonomic determination and by black opaque relatively large organic particles. The latter 
could frequently be identified as phytoclasts, chitinozoa and more rarely as zooclasts. 
Acritarchs and prasinophytes are present in most samples with ages from the Frasnian to 
the Early Tournaisian. These are frequently translucent, although commonly fragmented. 
Phytoclasts are generally rare.

Many non-productive samples allowed, however, simple kerogen typing and 
quantification of the organic components (see Palynofacies section). 

The overwhelming majority of the productive samples from the AVU provided 
poorly preserved palynomorphs. Complete recognizable palynomorphs were scarce and 
ornamentation was frequently destroyed (distal part of processes, fine sculpture, etc.). The 
operculum in prasinophytes was commonly absent and internal cyst coherence was often 
degraded and incipient fragmentation was present in many cases. Relevant characteristics 
of miospores such as the existence of layers (opposed to simple flanges), nature of 
cingulum/zona, details of trilete mark, etc. were very often difficult to observe. Few 
localities allowed the observation and taxonomic identification of palynomorphs with 
transmitted light. In most instances palynomorphs were black and opaque, occasionally 
partly translucent. Most organic residues were observed under a reflected light 
microscope. Thus, most of the taxa reported here are left in open nomenclature. 
Nevertheless most of the samples could be assigned to a stage and occasionally to one or 
to a group of biozones established for Devonian and Carboniferous of Western Europe 
(e.g. Clayton et al., 1977; Streel et al., 1984). 

3.3.4.1 Miospores 
 The spore assemblage recovered from Minhoteira (MIN locality) derives from 4 
productive samples from which several dozens of slides were made. This is one of the few 
localities that allowed the observation and documentation of palynomorphs using 
transmitted light.  
 Most of the specimens could not be identified and the total number of identified 
grains is too low to allow a quantitative approach. Nevertheless it is clear that spores 
assignable to Apiculiretusispora, Geminospora, Grandispora and to a lesser extent to 
Leiotriletes and Retusotriletes genera were dominant. Stratigraphically relevant taxa 
include Aneurospora extensa morphon (A. extensa – A. goensis) Turnau 1999; 
Aneurospora cf. greggsii  (McGregor) Streel 1974; Chelinospora concinna Allen, 1965; 
Contagisporites optivus var. vorobjevensis (Chibrikova) Owens 1971; Cristatisporites 
triangulatus (Allen) McGregor &amp;amp; Camfield 1982; cf. Densosporites devonicus Richardson 
1960; Geminospora lemurata Balme 1962 and Geminospora micromanifesta (Naumova) 
Arkhangelskaya 1985. Two specimens of Lophozonotriletes media Taugourdeau-Lantz,
1967 were found in one of the samples, but not Cirratriradites jekhowskyi Taugourdeau-
Lantz, 1967; Hystricosporites multifurcatus, (Winslow) Mortimer &amp;amp; Chaloner, 1967; 
Pustulatisporites rugulatus, (Taugourdeau-Lantz) Loboziak &amp;amp; Streel, 1981 and
Verrucosisporites bulliferus Richardson &amp;amp; Mcgregor, 1986. In fact, characteristic species 
that could be expected to appear together with the described assemblage such as 
Ancyrospora spp.; Emphanisporites spp. and Hystricosporites spp. were not found.
 It is worth referring the presence of taxa more commonly found in Eastern Europe 
and Central Asia such as Geminospora cf. aurita Arkhangelskaya, 1985; Geminospora
micromanifesta (Naumova) Arkhangelskaya 1985; Geminospora notata (Naumova) 
Obukhovskaya 1993; Kedoesporis imperfectus (Naumova) Obukhovskaya &amp;amp; 
Obukhovskaya, 2008; aff. Lophotriletes multiformis Tchibrikova, 1977; Retusotriletes cf. 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

61

scabratus Turnau 1986 (see for example Obukhovskaya &amp;amp; Obukhovskaya, 2008; 
Obukhovskaya et al., 2000). 
 Other taxa usually found in older Devonian strata such as Apiculiretusispora cf.
perfectae Steemans, 1989; Retusotriletes warringtonii Richardson &amp;amp; Lister, 1969; 
Latosporites cf. ovalis Breuer, Al-Ghazi, Al-Ruwaili, Higgs, Steemans &amp;amp; Wellman, 2007 
represent a small fraction of the assemblage and are interpreted as reworked. 

Considering the presence of Chelinospora concinna Allen, 1965 and 
Cristatisporites triangulatus (Allen) McGregor and Camfield 1982, the Minhoteira 
assemblage can be assigned to the TCo miospore biozone of Streel et al. (1987), 
equivalent to the optivus-triangulatus miospore biozone of Richardson &amp;amp; McGregor 
(1986): uppermost Givetian – lowermost Frasnian. The presence of Lophozonotriletes
media Taugourdeau-Lantz, 1967 would suggest the BM biozone of Streel et al. (1987), but 
none of the defining species of this and previous BJ biozones were recorded. Some of the 
taxa reported here more commonly found in Eastern Europe and Central Asia also 
indicates a younger age, equivalent to the EI subzone of the DE biozone as defined in 
Obukhovskaya et al. (2000): middle-upper Frasnian. 

The taxa usually found in older Devonian strata may have been reworked, although 
there was no visible difference in their preservation. Reworked acritarchs possibly of 
Early Devonian age were found in this locality (Machado et al., 2007).  

The stratigraphical relevance in Western Europe of taxa used to define and 
characterize biozones in Eastern Europe is uncertain. The Minhoteira assemblage is thus 
considered to be Early Frasnian in age (TCo biozone possibly extending to BM biozone of 
Streel et al. (1974)). 
 Nearly all other samples produced residues containing palynomorphs not 
observable by standard transmitted light methods. Occasionally spores with a relatively 
thin wall could be successfully observed and photographed. All oxidation methods tested 
resulted in the partial or total destruction of the organic residue. Oxidation methods were, 
however, successfully used by Fernandes et al., (2001) with samples from the AVU. In 
most instances residues were only properly observed using reflected light microscopy. 
This allowed taxonomical work to be conducted although with some limitations. A single 
(proximal or distal) surface could be observed and frequently the true nature and 
dimensions of flanges, cingula/zoni could not be described appropriately. Documentation 
of specimens using this method was possible in some cases, but often the resulting images 
were too blurred to be used in any type of illustration.  
 Stratigraphical palynology in most cases was based on first known occurrence of 
Genera and Species. Standard miospore biozonation for the Devonian and Carboniferous 
was not directly applicable not only due to the poor preservation but also due to the lack of 
continuous sections were miospore assemblage successions could be observed. 
 Famennian and Early Tournaisian miospore assemblages are characterized by the 
presence of Grandispora cf. echinata Hacquebard, 1957; Grandispora aff. cornuta Higgs 
1975; Grandispora cf. famenensis (Naumova) Streel, 1974 in Becker et al. 1974 var. 
minuta Nekriata, 1974 and especially by Grandispora gracilis (Kedo) Streel in Becker et 
al., 1974 which is present in nearly every sample of this age and also appears as a 
reworked form in Viséan samples. Other characterizing taxa are Corbulispora cancellata
(Waltz) Bharadwaj &amp;amp; Venkatachala, 1961; rarely Cyrtospora cristifer (Luber) Van der 
Zwan, 1979 and Emphanisporites rotatus (McGregor) McGregor 1973; Rugospora cf. 
flexuosa (Jushko) Streel in Becker et al., 1974 and Verrucosisporites nitidus morphon 
(sensu Van der Zwan, 1980). Late Famennian/Early Tournaisian assemblages commonly 
contain a number of taxa which are probably reworked from (?)Frasnian sediments such as 
Hymenozonotriletes spp. and Archaeoperisaccus aff. ovalis Naumova, 1953. 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

62

 Viséan assemblages are difficult to identify positively but the presence of 
Apiculatisporis cf. hacquebardi Playford, 1964; Densosporites annulatus (Loose) Smith &amp;amp; 
Butterworth, 1967; Lycospora spp.; Schulzospora spp.; Stenozonotriletes lycosporoides
(Butterworth &amp;amp; Williams) Smith &amp;amp; Butterworth, 1967; Triquitrites spp.; Verrucosisporites
baccatus Staplin, 1960 are indicative of this stage. It is difficult to match each sample to a 
specific biozone within the Viséan as frequently only one or two characteristic taxa are 
present.
 Serpukovian assemblages are relatively diversified and several taxa allow the 
attribution of samples to this stage. Identified taxa include Acanthotriletes cf. aculeolatus
(Kosanke) Potonié &amp;amp; Kremp, 1955; Apiculatisporis cf. variocorneus Sullivan, 1964; 
Crassispora aff. kosankei (Potonié &amp;amp; Kremp) Smith &amp;amp; Butterworth, 1967; Dictyotriletes
castaneaeformis (Horst) Sullivan, 1964; Grumosisporites inaequalis (Butterworth &amp;amp; 
Williams) Smith &amp;amp; Butterworth 1967 and other species of this genus; Leiotriletes spp.;
Lycospora cf. subtriquetra (Luber) Potonié &amp;amp; Kremp, 1956; Proprisporites laevigatus
Neves, 1961; cf. Savitrisporites nux (Butterworth &amp;amp; Williams) Smith &amp;amp; Butterworth, 
1967. It is possible that some samples are actually Early Bashkirian as some of the 
identified taxa have ranges that extend into the Bashkirian, although none is restricted to 
this stage. Assemblages assigned to the Serpukovian usually include several forms which 
are most likely reworked such as Apiculatasporites wapsipiniconensis Peppers, 1969; aff. 
Geminospora spp.; Grandispora spp.; Lophozonotriletes spp.; Rugospora spp. and 
Samarisporites sp.

3.3.4.2 Organic-walled microplankton 
The preservation of the palynological assemblages is usually poor to moderate, but 

some assemblages contain particularly abundant and diversified acritarchs. The better 
studied assemblages originate from the Upper Devonian black shales of the classical 
locality of the Albergaria-a-Velha area (VAL locality), along with other black shale 
outcrops of Famennian and Early Tournaisian age (namely localities ASS, DUP, SER, 
SOB – see Fig. 3.1 and Appendix 1 for details). The diversified assemblage contains over 
50 different acritarch and prasinophyte species. Prasinophyte phycomata are invariably 
small or very small (5 to 15µm), except for some Dictyotidium spp. which may be up to 
40µm. Acritarchs were not used as a biostratigraphical tool (despite the existence of some 
acritarch based biozonation of the Frasnian and Famennian - e.g. Vanguestaine, 1986; 
Vanguestaine et al., 1983) as spores were present in all samples that contain acritarchs and 
could be used for biostratigraphical purposes. 

Qualitative analysis of the assemblage points to a close affinity with the Laurussian 
late Devonian marine Realm, in contrast with the Late Devonian assemblages from the 
South Portuguese Zone which show clear affinities with North Gondwana, as suggested by 
Clayton et al. (2002). Previous work by Vavrdová and Isaacson (1999) included late 
Devonian acritarch assemblages of the Represa and Phyllite-Quartzite Formations 
described in Cunha &amp;amp; Oliveira (1989) as belonging to the Gondwanan Realm. The affinity 
of the Albergaria-a-Velha shales is indicated by the presence of Cymatiosphaera
perimembrana Staplin, 1961; Uncinisphaera (Villosacapsula) ceratioides (Stockmans &amp;amp; 
Willière) Colbath, 1990; Winwaloeusia cf. ranulaeforma Martin, 1984 and other acritarch 
genera and species described from Central and Northern Europe (especially Belgium – 
Ardennes-Rhenish massif) and Eastern USA and a complete absence, so far, of species of 
Horologinella and Schizocystia (common Gondwanan genera). Other common 
Gondwanan genera such as Umbellasphaerdium and Crassiangulina are possibly present 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

63

in the Albergaria shales, but only one fragmented specimen of each taxon was found, 
making the identification tentative. 

Cluster analysis 
Previous work conducted by Clayton et al. (2002) and Colbath (1990) on Late 

Devonian organic-walled microplankton suggested the existence of a cluster with 
Gondwanan affinities and another with Laurussian affinities (apart from other areas – see 
Colbath, 1990), coherent with the idea proposed by Vanguestaine (1986) and later by 
Vavrdová and Isaacson (1999). As discussed by Colbath (1990), any attempt to quantify 
the statistical proximity of assemblages is limited by several factors, namely the different 
criteria between workers, uneven amount of publications between regions and of course 
the natural phenotypic variability of acritarchs and prasinophytes and local and regional 
ecological variability.  

With the aim of testing the initial qualitative results a cluster analysis was 
performed using the data obtained so far from the Albergaria-a-Velha black shales and 
data available in the literature from the following areas:  
- Belgium: Martin (1981, 1985) and Stockmans and Willière (1969, 1974); 
- Eastern USA: Clayton et al. (2002); Molyneaux et al. (1984); Wicander (1974, 1983); 
Wicander and Loeblich (1977) and Wicander and Playford (1985); 
- Libya: El-Mehdawi (1998); Clayton et al. (2002); Moreau-Benoit (1984); Paris et al. 
(1985) and Streel et al. (1988); 
- Algeria: Clayton et al. (2002) and Jardiné et al. (1972, 1974); 
- South Portuguese Zone: Clayton et al. (2002); Cunha and Oliveira (1989); Gonzalez et 
al. (2005) and Pereira (1999).

PAST – Palaeontological Statistics Freeware was used to perform the analysis and 
the Paired group algorithm with Jaccard similarity measure was chosen.

The similarity cluster diagram (Fig. 3.15) and correlation matrix (Table 3.8) show 
a very close relation between the Libyan and Algerian assemblages, as already reported in 
Clayton et al. (2002). The similarity of the South Portuguese Zone with these two areas is 
evident and even higher than suggested earlier by Clayton et al. (2002). The Albergaria-a-
Velha assemblage clusters closely with the Belgium assemblages and to a lesser extent to 
those of Eastern USA. In general the Albergaria-a-Velha assemblage shows closer 
similarity to the Laurussian Realm, contrasting with the North Gondwanan assemblages. 

It has to be mentioned that all the clusters’ cut-off points are close to the base of 
the diagram which suggests a low degree of diversification. This is probably an artefact of 
the chosen algorithm, but also a result of an (still) incomplete database. Nevertheless 
general groups of assemblages can be defined and thus palaeobiogeographical 
interpretations can be attempted.

Table 3.10 – Rock-eval parameters of the analyzed samples from the AVU and their ages. 

All samples are characterized by considerably low TOC values and by an apparent 
high maturity. There seems to be little or no differentiation of samples according to their 
age.

The high maturity is indicated by the low S1 and S2 values (see Fig. 3.16). 
Production index (PI) is also very low and indicates high thermal maturity equivalent to 
dry gas generation zone. This is coherent with the observed maturation in palynological 
slides where all the organic matter is dark grey to black. The vast majority of the analyzed 
organic residues have slightly translucent to opaque, black spores, indicating a TAI &gt; 4+. 
A few localities, however, show translucent grey spores. Previous work conducted on the 
AVU, regarding the illite crystallinity and other crystallographic parameters of 
phyllosilicates indicated that the AVU had undergone metamorphic conditions of high 
anchizone – epizone, with palaeotemperatures &gt;200ºC and pressures between 1 and 2 
Kbar, (Vázquez et al., 2007). Measurements of vitrinite reflectance obtained from heavy 
liquid concentrates indicate Rr% values between 1 and 1,3% (Chaminé et al., 2003; Moço 
et al., 2001). Palynological residues from the AVU mounted on acrylic plates and polished 
were observed for this study. Very few particles could be positively identified as being 
vitrinite, since petrologic information is lost in palynological residues. Nevertheless all 
measured particles resulted in values higher than 3 Rr%.
 The Tmax values below 400 °C do not represent kerogen maturity and are related to 
residual bitumen or exsudatinite.

Fig. 3.16 – S1, S2 and S3 values for the analyzed samples from the AVU. 

 Kerogen typing can usually be performed using Hydrogen and Oxygen indices 
(HI/OI) ratios plotted on van Krevelen diagram (Tissot et al., 1974). This application is 
limited with increasing temperature and consequent reduction of both HI and OI.

Fig. 3.17 – van Krevelen diagram with 3 main types of kerogen and the HI/OI ratios of the AVU 
samples. Original diagram from Tissot et al., 1974. 

 The AVU samples have considerably low values of HI (&lt;60 mgHC/g TOC) and OI 
(&lt;190 mgCO2/g TOC), thus most of them plot in the area where the 3 types of kerogen 
lines merge, rendering kerogen typing impossible (Fig. 3.17). However 3 samples 
(MIN16.3, MIR4.3 and ALH1.4) plot within the kerogen type III field, i.e., of essentially 
terrestrial origin and thus gas-prone. The palynofacies data indicate that terrestrial 
influence was scarce, even for the more proximal environments recorded in some rocks of 
Serpukovian age. The organic residues of the AVU are typically marine AOM-rich (&gt;85% 
of total organic residue) with accessory amounts of organic-walled microplankton, spores 
and generally rare or very rare phytoclasts.

The source rock potential of the analyzed samples seems limited. This is readily 
indicated by the low TOC values (&lt;0,5wt%) and also by the low S1 and S2 values ( 0,05
mgHC/g rock). The palynofacies analysis on shale samples of the AVU invariably 
indicates oil-prone source rocks, although this method does not give an estimate of the 
proportion of the hydrocarbon-prone material per weight or volume of rock.  

3.4 Discussion and Conclusions 
The dominant presence of quartz (and quartzose clasts – cherts and quartzites) 

imply that the observed framework modes derive from significantly mature detritus (e.g. 
Prothero and Schwab, 1996). The high proportion of matrix/cement in all samples would 
indicate otherwise (sensu Folk, 1951), but this textural characteristic may have been 
substantially altered by the low grade metamorphic conditions to which this unit was 
exposed. Such changes in the matrix’s nature are observable in some of the samples (Pl. 
3.17C). In addition the textural characteristics may be related to the type of sediment 
reaching the shelf areas (which was very likely mud-rich) and later transported by 
turbidity currents. 

The distribution of the data-set within the craton interior and quartzitic recycled 
orogen fields may reflect a drainage basin located on an essentially stable cratonic area 
(Central Iberian Zone?) which may have a collisional or transcurrent character along its 
margin; it has been suggested (Chaminé et al., 2003, 2007) that the Porto-Tomar shear 
zone was already active during the Late Devonian and Mississippian, controlling the 
regional sedimentation by forming scattered pull-apart like and/or fault-wedge basins in a 
marine setting near a continental block. The results presented here suggest that such 
tectonic activity may have been affecting the continental block where the source areas 
were located, but probably were not affecting the shelf and basin floor where 
sedimentation was occurring. Neither intraclasts nor clasts from the closely associated 
Arada unit where found in the analysed frameworks. These would be expected if 
significant tectonic activity (and consequent recycling) was occurring within the 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

68

sedimentation area (compare for example Burnett &amp;amp; Quirk, 2001; McCann, 1991). It 
should be mentioned, however, that shale clasts were observed at the outcrop scale in one 
locality (SND – see Fig. 3.1). The same locality presented relatively large (&gt;1cm 
diameter) quartzite grains within fine-sandstone beds. The significance of this shale and 
quartzite clasts is uncertain.

The results from the undulosity of quartz, although restricted to a few samples, 
clearly indicate that the sediments of the AVU derive from rocks with a low metamorphic 
grade. This is coherent with the observed presence of quartzite and chert grains. The CIZ 
can be a potential source area. This zone is adjacent to the AVU and composed essentially 
by low grade metasediments of Late Proterozoic–Cambrian age (“Complexo Xisto-
Grauváquico”, i.e., Schist-Greywacke Complex – e.g., Carríngton da Costa, 1950; Medina 
et al., 1989, 1993) overlain by Ordovician to Lower Devonian (e.g. Cooper, 1980; Oliveira 
et al., 1992; Paris, 1981) very low grade metasediments. The timing of the metamorphic 
event (or events) that affected the CIZ and the time at which these metasediments were 
exposed and eroded is certainly pre-Late Pennsylvanian (see Chapter 4; Gama Pereira, 
1987). It is uncertain, however, if they were already exposed by Late Devonian times. 

The sand/mud ratio varies greatly, but, with few exceptions, mud clearly dominates 
and the sand is usually medium to fine. Most of the available relatively undeformed 
sections (sand-silt-shale facies) show a turbiditic character and possibly a (distal?) 
prodelta setting. The textural maturity of the sandstones and the general dominance of 
mud over sand imply the existence of a considerably large and essentially low relief 
drainage area and also the presence of a deltaic system where most of the coarser 
sediments are trapped (Bouma, 2000). A similar sedimentary setting, associated with a 
large deltaic system was described by Ahrens (1936) and Stets &amp;amp; Shäfer (2008) from the 
Central Facies Belt of the Devonian of the Rhenohercynian basin. Although deformed and 
slightly metamorphosed in some areas, the gradual passage from deltaic subaerial (to NW) 
to shallow marine and to deeper marine settings (to SE) is clearly observed in this basin. 
In the case of the AVU, only the distal parts of a similar sedimentary system were 
preserved. This implies that the post-sedimentary tectonic evolution of the area, clearly 
associated with the Porto-Tomar shear zone (Chaminé et al., 2003a, b, 2007), destroyed 
most of the sedimentary record and preserved only a few discrete portions of a much 
larger basin, as nappes over older rocks. The sedimentary information collected strongly 
suggests that a turbidite system close to the fine-grained end member (sensu Bouma, 
2000) is represented by the metasediments of the AVU. The observed turbidite sequences 
can be generally included in facies association V and more rarely IV (BOS section) of 
Mutti and Normark (1987), indicating distal (rarely intermediate) lobe depositional 
elements. The sedimentary packages composed essentially or entirely by shales (black 
shale and laminated grey shale facies) within this unit are volumetrically important and are 
not always associated (at least spatially) with packages identified as turbidites. These shale 
packages may represent the distal parts of lobes formed by turbidite deposition and/or 
hemipelagic deposits.  

The palynofacies analysis, coupled with the lithological and sedimentological 
characteristics of the metasediments of the AVU show some palaeoenvironmental 
variations through time. A single sedimentation environment seems to be recorded from 
Frasnian sediments (laminated grey shales). A marine, most likely basinal setting is 
indicated by the finely laminated grey shales with a typical marine palynological 
association. The constant presence of organic matter and significant proportion of AOM, 
shown by palynological analysis, along with the cm- to mm-lamination and the absence of 
bioturbation (although the macro-scale observational evidence is strongly limited by 
deformation) implies that, generally, the marine organic productivity in the water column 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

69

was considerably high, but also that the oxygen minimum was near or below the sediment-
water interface where sedimentation was taking place (Calvert, 1987, Curtis, 1980). A 
similar setting with laminated sediments forming in areas where the oxygen minimum 
intersected the ocean floor was described by Calvert (1964) and Donegan &amp;amp; Schrader 
(1982) in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The characteristics of the palynological content of Frasnian samples are in 
accordance with this interpretation. The lighter and darker laminae commonly found 
suggest can be interpreted as rhythmites. The origin and processes responsible for this 
rhythmical sedimentation are difficult to determine. A distal deltaic suspension fall out 
sedimentation type with a seasonal control can tentatively explain the observed 
sedimentary features. This lithofacies is also observed in the Viséan and Serpukovian 
(more rarely in Tournaisian-Famennian rocks) and, presumably, the sedimentary setting 
where these facies is formed prevailed through time.  

The Tournaisian and Famennian rocks are, in most instances, black shales, with a 
characteristic palynological content; AOM-rich along with a diversified organic-walled 
microplankton assemblage. The terrestrial influence is increased, indicated by the greater 
presence of spores and slightly higher phytoclast content. 

Fig. 3.19 – General schematic representation of the hypothetical tectonic and sedimentation setting of 
the AVU. 

 Viséan and Serpukovian sediments are generally more coarse grained, with the 
appearance of turbidite and (?)pro-delta sediments, but the black shale and laminated grey 
shale facies persist, indicating a diversification of sedimentary environments. The amount 
of terrestrial input is greater, indicated by the generally coarser-grained sediments but also 
the greater amount of spores and, to a lesser extent, the amount of phytoclasts. AOM 
proportions decrease slightly. It should be mentioned that acritarch diversity and 
abundance decreases globally in the latest Devonian and especially during the 
Mississippian (see Strother, 2008 for a revision of previous work and causes) which could 
have influenced the results obtained from palynofacies analyses. Nevertheless other 
palynological and lithological “proxies” point to the same conclusions. 
 Overall it seems the sedimentary system has a general prograding tendency, from 
basinal distal deposits during the Frasnian to more proximal settings in the Viséan and 
especially during the Serpukovian where turbidites seem to prevail.

The thermal and burial history of the AVU as a whole started after the Serpukovian 
(youngest sediments) and lasted, in a first phase, to the Lower Triassic. This is indicated 
by the outcrop-scale observation of Lower Triassic sediments of the Lusitanian basin 
(Grés de Silves Fm.) resting unconformably over the AVU in several localities and 
associated ferruginization (see Pl. 3.16A). The intramontane Late Pennsylvanian Buçaco 
basin (Wagner et al., 1983; Pinto de Jesus et al., 2010; see Chapter 4) does not overlay the 
AVU stratigraphically; the contacts are invariably tectonic. This indicates that the 
exhumation of the AVU happened in post-Late Pennsylvanian and pre-Late Triassic times. 
It also indicates that the thermal and generally the geological history of the basin 
represented by the AVU in this region were significantly controlled by the PTSZ which 
was active at least from the Late Pennsylvanian. The potential oil play system formed by 
the AVU, Buçaco basin sediments and the Lusitanian basin lacks the correct timing of 
events within and near this shear zone. However, the basin represented by the AVU most 
probably extended far beyond the influence of the PTSZ (see Capdevila &amp;amp; Mougenot, 
1988, Moço et al., 2001) and may be preserved as basement under the Lusitanian basin, 
both on- and off-shore. Indeed samples from shallow wells located in the Lusitanian basin 
(Estarreja and Ovar area) that reached the basement (A. Cavaco hydrogeology company 
internal reports) analysed by us indicate the presence of shales with similar palynological 
content (regarding age and palynofacies) to the AVU. Additional interest on the pre-
Triassic source rocks and the associated oil play was shown by Uphoff (2005). Based on a 
deep exploration well (Aljubarrota 1) that reached the basement and presented oil shows 
within the Triassic sediments and additional geophysical and organic geochemical results 
he considers at least two Palaeozoic units as source rocks and a Triassic-Jurassic reservoir 
and seal (Uphoff, 2005). The source rock units are considered to be 1) the lateral, distal, 
extension of the Buçaco basin and 2) Silurian shales (Vale da Ursa and Sazes Fms.) 
(Uphoff, 2005). The significance of the Silurian shales as part of the oil play is considered 
here as limited or non-existent since these are Central Iberian Zone units, which most 
probably does not extend to the West, below the Lusitanian basin (Capdevila &amp;amp; 
Mougenot, 1988). 

It is worth mentioning the possible interest of the AVU as a shale gas source rock. 
It is within the dry gas generation zone; it is volumetrically quite important both at the 
surface and subsurface (although its true volume and extension are still unknown) and it is 
highly fractured. It is uncertain if the low TOC values present here are representative of 
the AVU preserved in the subsurface. The van Krevelen diagram points to a gas-prone 
rock which is in contrast with the palynological content of this unit (which clearly 
indicates an oil-prone source rock). This can be explained by the current thermal maturity 
of the AVU – dry gas generation zone – which would result in the observed OI/HI ratios. 

Notes on the cartographic differentiation of the AVU and Arada unit 
 As mentioned before the differentiation of the two units is extremely difficult. 
Nevertheless some criteria may be used in the field and when analyzing samples in the lab. 
This is a compilation of the author’s experience and shared knowledge of the area with 
Hélder Chaminé and Paulo Fonseca.

Table 3.11 – Practical criteria to differentiate the AVU and Arada unit. 

 During the course of this work, hundreds of outcrops were examined. It became 
clear that the vast majority of them could be positively considered to belong to the AVU. 
The initial suspicion in the field was later confirmed by the analysis of the palynological 
residues from the samples taken. The initial representations of the AVU as discrete, 
restricted and scattered groups of outcrops within the Arada unit (with much greater 
cartographic extension) e.g. Chaminé et al. (2003; 2007) should probably be revised, 
although the way to correctly represent the AVU remains uncertain.  
 The area mapped as AVU between the villages of Valongo do Vouga and 
Carvoeiro (Gomes et al., 2007 and the eastern basin referred in Vázquez et al., 2007), 
bordering the contact between the CIZ and the OMZ most probably is not AVU. This is 
indicated by the lithologies found along this area (non-laminated light grey shales) and by 
the palynological content which did not produced palynomorphs. The rocks present in this 
area are tentatively assigned to the Ordovician grey shales and phyllites that crop out 
further N and S of this area. 
 The Sernada-do-Vouga unit or sub-unit referred in some papers (e.g. Chaminé et 
al. 2007; Gomes et al., 2007) can be tentatively correlated with the Viséan and 
Serpukovian coarser sediments (sand-silt-shale beds lithofacies) of the AVU.

Description: Trilete camerate spores with triangular to roundly triangular outline. Intexine 
outline generally conformable with exine outline. Trilete mark usually damaged, straight 
or slightly sinuous extending to 4/5 of intexine body radius. Laesurae with narrow (ca. 
2µm wide) lips. Intexine with densely packed grana and small verrucae. Exoexine thinner 
than intexine, laevigate, with few, very broad-based coni around the equator.
Dimensions: Maximum width: 87 to 110µm; Maximum length: 90 to 133µm. Intexine 
body diameter is 75 to 80% of total spore diameter. 
Remarks: Only 3 badly preserved specimens were observed. The specimens could also 
belong to Genus Auroraspora, considering that the exine could actually be a flange, 
however the simple connate ornamentation is more indicative of Grandispora.

Genus Veryhachium (Deunff) Sarjeant &amp;amp; Stancliffe, 1994 
Remarks: The idea of Wicander &amp;amp; Wood, 1981 is favoured here, in that Veryhachium spp. 
should be considered a group or complex composed of forms with laevigate wall, vesicle 
with triangular outline (more or less convex/concave sides) and wide range of sizes and 3 
short or long processes in the corners of the vesicle, within the same plane. Veryhachium
europaeum possibly corresponds better to the concept of Dorsennidium. For taxonomic 
purposes, species that seem to be morphologically distinct, i.e., without transitional forms 
between them are considered.

Abstract
The Buçaco basin is a Pennsylvanian continental basin located along an important 

NNW-SSE strike shear zone that separates the Ossa-Morena and Central Iberian Zones in 
central western and NW Portugal. The shear zone controlled the basin’s sedimentation and 
probably its post-sedimentary evolution. Sedimentation is initially alluvial with 
characteristic red sandstones breccias and conglomerates. A gradual change to fluvial (and 
possibly lacustrine) type of sedimentation is observed. Palynological data indicate that the 
sedimentation took place during the Gzhelian (NBM Miospore Biozone of Clayton et al., 
1977). “Autunian” (early Permian) assemblages were not found. The provenance of 
sediments and the thermal history is discussed as well as the geometrical and chronological 
relations of the basin with the surrounding units. 
Key-words: Buçaco Basin, Gzhelian, spores/pollen, Continental sedimentation, Ossa-
Morena Zone, Central Iberian Zone, SW Portugal. 

4.1 Local geological setting and structural outline 
The Pennsylvanian Buçaco basin crops out in several areas for nearly 30km along a 

N-S trend between the villages of Bolfiar (Northernmost outcrops) and Monte Redondo 
(Southernmost outcrops) Northeast of Coimbra. The width is highly variable due to the 
irregular contact (sedimentary and tectonic) with neighbouring formations. The maximum 
width is approximately 2km. To the S it pinches out and locally the W and E edges are 
limited by faults associated with the Porto-Tomar shear zone. Caenozoic sediments cover

131

the basin to the N, and the basin’s rocks are only visible along relatively deep valleys that 
cut the Caenozoic cover. Its western edge is very frequently limited by faults that put it in 
direct contact with the Albergaria-a-Velha and Arada units of the Ossa-Morena Zone 
(Chaminé et al., 2003; Gama-Pereira et al., 2008) or the Upper Triassic (Adloff et al., 
1974; Palain, 1976, Palain et al., 1977) sediments of the Lusitanian basin (Grés de Silves 
Fm.). The contact of the basin’s rocks with the Grés de Silves Fm. is seldom exposed. It is 
invariably materialized by a fault or by a high angle angular unconformity (Luso area). The 
eastern edge is defined by faults in the southernmost sector, but for the most part the basin, 
the basal unit (Algeriz Fm. – see bellow) rests unconformably over the units of the Central 
Iberian Zone (CIZ): Cambrian - Pre-Cambrian metasediments of the “Complexo Xisto-
Grauváquico” (CXG) and Ordovician sedimentary rocks (Ribeiro, 1853; Courbouliex, 
1974; Domingos et al., 1983; Flores et al., 2010) 
 The structure of the basin has been generally presented by Domingos et al. (1983) 
and described in more detail by Gama-Pereira et al. (2008) and Flores et al. (2010). The 
basin forms a highly asymmetrical syncline with a long, normal eastern flank and an 
overturned to vertical short western flank (Domingos et al., 1983; Wagner and Sousa, 
1983; Flores et al., 2010). Based on the current outcrop pattern, field structural evidence 
and the relation with the Porto-Tomar shear zone (PTSZ) Gama-Pereira et al. (2008) and 
Flores et al., (2010) interpret this as a pull-apart basin with a subsiding western block. In 
their model the pulses of the Porto-Tomar dextral shear zone control the major sedimentary 
phases of the basin as the Eastern block was uplifted and eroded. 

4.1.1 Previous work 
The first published work about this basin dates back to the 1800’s when Carlos 

Ribeiro (Ribeiro, 1853) identified Carboniferous rocks in this area. He correctly identified 
and distinguished the several units that crop out in this area and described the geometrical 
relations between them. A lithological map and several schematic cross-sections were also 
presented. Bernardino Gomes and later Wenceslau de Lima (Gomes, 1865; Lima, 
1888/1892; 1894) reported and described fossil plants from several sites and discussed the 
age of the assemblages. The basin has been studied by several authors during the last 
century, namely Teixeira (1941a, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1949) dealing mostly with 
palaeontological aspects, Corboulieux (1972, 1974) dealing with regional geology and 
stratigraphy; Pires (1972) briefly studied the sedimentology of a few small sections and 
Sousa &amp;amp; Wagner (1983); Wagner &amp;amp; Sousa (1983) and Wagner et al. (1983) dealt with the 
stratigraphy and palaeobotany of the basin. The latter work defined 3 formations of the 
basin according to sedimentological and palaeobotanical criteria (see Table 4.3). This 
definition is the one used in most of the subsequent studies. Two short papers on the nature 
and characteristics of the clasts of the conglomerates have been published by Neiva (1943) 
and Carvalho (1949). One paper (Gomes et al., 2005) was published on the palynology and 
palaeomagnetism of the basin and overlying Grés de Silves Fm. (Upper Triassic) but only 
poorly preserved pollen/spore assemblages were found. The sedimentology and the 
prevailing sedimentary environments of the basin were addressed in a conference paper by 
Dinis &amp;amp; Reis (2007) who concluded that lacustrine sedimentation was a common feature, 
both vertically and laterally, and not restricted to the coaly shale-siltstone dominated Vale 
da Mó Fm. (see Table 4.3). More recently two studies on the organic facies and petrology 
with some data on the basin’s structure have been published (Gama-Pereira et al., 2008; 
Flores et al., 2010).

4.1.2 Age of the basin 
The age of the macrofloral assemblages as been discussed since the first 

palaebotanical studies conducted by Gomes and Lima (Gomes, 1865; Lima, 1888/1892; 
1894). Lima considered the assemblages to be comparable with the ones from Rotliegend 
in Germany and Autun in France (then lower Permian), although he mentioned in his 
correspondence with Zeiller (Teixeira, 1941b) that other taxa would correspond to the 
“houiller supérieur” (Pennsylvanian). Lima also considered that there were no significant 
differences between the assemblages found in different stratigraphic levels (Lima, 
1888/1892) although these different levels were not identified. Florin (1940) considered 
the assemblage to be typically Permian due to the presence, among others, of Lebachia
laxifolia Florin, 1939. Later Teixeira (1941a, 1944, 1945, 1947 and 1949) persisted the 
idea that the assemblages could be late Stephanian C or early Autunian. Courbouliex 
(1974) reported two new palaeobotanical localities which, according to P. Corsin’s 
identification and interpretation, would be Stephanian C in age and concluded that 
sedimentation in the basin lasted from the Stephanian C to the Autunian. The most recent 
work by Wagner and Sousa (1983) and Wagner et al. (1983) is based on the collections 
available in several Portuguese museums, the published work and collection of new 
specimens. They concluded that all the assemblages (including the ones referenced by 
Courbouliex, 1974) can be placed in the late Stephanian C – early Autunian interval and 
that no taxon has a range restricted to either of these stages. The work by Gomes et al. 
(2005) recovered Potonieisporites novicus (Bharadwaj) Poort &amp;amp; Veld, 1997 from the Santa 
Cristina area (Monsarros Fm.) which again did not restrict the age to a particular stage. 

4.2 Materials and methods 
 The sections available are relatively continuous E-W road cuts in the Vale da Mó – 
Vale de Boi road (Northern part – called here VMO section), Parada-Algeriz-Monsarros 
(central area – called here ALG section) and Santa Cristina (Southern part, called here CRI 
section) (Fig. 4.1). Additional sections are available in the Gralheira area, especially 
around the Gralheira reservoir (GRA section) and at Salgueiral (SAL section) but these 
cover only the basal formation. The ALG section is the most complete and the one used by 
most authors to describe the basin. Road cuts are typically ca. 3m tall except for some 
conglomeratic levels that can reach more than 10m. Strata dip from 20 to ca 60º to W 
which seriously limits the observation of lateral facies variations. Other sections are 
available in ~N-S roads but these have limited vertical extents. The current structure of the 
basin and the available sections result in the construction of lithological columns that go 
not only from basal to higher levels, but also from proximal to distal facies as the observer 
moves away from the source area (see following sections). 

Several sections were described and sampled for palynology (and duplicates for 
XRD and organic petrology): ALG section, Parada-Algeriz-Monsarros road cuts, (all 
formations well exposed); the southern section in the road East of Santa Cristina – CRI 
section (parts of the Monsarros Fm. exposed); the Vale da Mó-Vale de Boi road section  - 
VMO section (Algeriz Fm. badly exposed, but very fresh road cuts for the Monsarros 
Fm.); the Gralheira area – GRA section (Algeriz Fm. well exposed) and Salgueiral – SAL 
section (part of the Algeriz Fm and a small part of the Monsarros Fm.).

Miall’s facies code system was applied (Miall, 1996, see table 4.1), although the 
poor exposure and weathering limited its application in numerous occasions. The reduced 
extent of the outcrops did not allow the proper identification and interpretation of groups of 
facies as architectural elements. The same problem was encountered when defining ranks 
of bounding surfaces.

4.3 Results 

4.3.1 Description and definition of facies associations and 
formational units

As mentioned before the basin’s sediments have been divided into 3 Formations by 
Wagner et al., (1983). Other subdivisions have been proposed, namely by Courbouliex, 
(1972, 1974). Table 4.3 is a tentative summarization of the proposed divisions and their 
correlation. It should be mentioned that all previous work was based almost exclusively on 
the ALG section. Other sections to the N and S show appreciable differences in vertical 
thicknesses and some lateral facies changes are significant. 

The Algeriz Fm. (basal unit) was logged (from N to S) at the GRA, VMO, ALG 
(Algeriz-Parada road) and SAL sections. Exposure at the CRI section is very poor. The 
most complete section of the Algeriz Fm. is at the GRA section, where the sequence can be 
observed from its erosive contact with the CIZ units to the first grey measures of the 
overlying Formation. In this section, the total thickness is estimated to be ca. 145m with 
some degree of uncertainty due to observational gaps and small faults. 

This Formation is characterized by a basal group of beds composed of red coloured, 
massive, matrix-supported, coarse grained (up to 20cm clasts) breccias beds up to 6m thick 
(usually 1 to 2m) – facies association SG1. Miall’s facies codes associated with this facies 
association are Gmm, Gmg and more rarely Gcm and Gci (see Fig. 4.2, 4.3, 4.7 and 4.11 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

135

and Pl. 4.6A). Rarely Ss and Sm occur on top of breccia beds. Schists and other 
metapelites derived from the CXG and possibly from other schistose units of the CIZ are 
characteristic clasts of these breccias. These can constitute up to 90% of the clasts in some 
breccia beds, but in most cases they range from 10 to 30%. These beds usually exhibit 
chaotic arrangement of clasts, with weak normal to inverse grading. The basal breccia beds 
are restricted to the initial ca. 5m, except at the SAL section where they are about 15m 
thick.  These are followed by a thick sequence of red coloured, clast-supported, massive to 
crudely bedded conglomerates – facies association SG2. Miall’s facies codes associated 
with this facies association are Gcm and more rarely Gmg and Gci (see Fig. 4.2, 4.3, 4.7 
and 4.11). To the top Gh occurs. Maximum clast size varies from bed to bed, but it is rarely 
above 20cm. Sandstones and finer grained lithologies are extremely rare and restricted to 
the top of some of the conglomeratic beds. At the ALG section there are a few organic 
matter-rich fine sandstone and mudstone layers within this subunit. The basal contact of 
each conglomeratic bed is erosional in most instances. The amount of schist and metapelite 
clasts gradually diminishes to the top of the subunit, but in some beds there are “abundance 
peaks”. This gradual and irregular change probably reflects equivalent changes of 
catchment areas. Other clast lithologies are quartzites and quartz. These are common to 
abundant since the first breccia beds and increase their abundance as the schist diminishes. 
In the first few meters, all transported clasts have a red patina and most of them have an 
oxidized (reddish) core. To the top, the patina persists but the proportion of clasts with 
reddish core diminishes gradually. The roundness changes gradually but very irregularly 
from very angulose/angulose clasts at the base to sub-angulose/sub-rounded at the top of 
the conglomerate subunit. This reflects not only the decreasing proportion of schist clasts 
(which tend to be more angulose) but also the effective better roundness of quartz and 
quartzite clasts. Although no palaeocurrent data was obtained from this subunit the source 
area is easily determinable. All recognizable clast lithologies from the breccias and 
conglomerates can be positively identified as belonging to the CXG and Ordovician units 
of the CIZ. Furthermore, near the contact area all these older units have an extensive 
ferruginization which is also observed in most clasts of the breccia beds (Pl. 4.6A). This 
basal part of the Algeriz Fm. was briefly described by Wagner et al. (1983), but not 
differentiated as a subunit. Courboulieux (1972, 1974) refers to this subunit as the unit 1 - 
conglomerát de base (Table 4.3).  

  The thickness of this basal subunit seems to decrease from N to S. It is over 55m 
thick at the GRA section – the type section, less than 20m at the VMO section (top not 
observed), over 34 at Salgueiral and corresponds to the first 10m of the ALG section.  

In terms of formal units the basal breccias and conglomerates can be designated as 
a member, provisionally called Gralheira Member. Its most characteristic features are the 
presence of red coloured matrix- or clast-supported breccias and conglomerates and the 
very rare occurrence of sandstone or mudstone interbeds. 

The overlying subunit is composed of red coloured massive to faintly laminated, 
often pebbly sandstones (Pl. 4.6D, F) and red coloured, clast-supported, massive to crudely 
bedded conglomerates. The latter are composed mostly of quartzite and quartz clasts, with 
schist and metapelite making up 10 to 20% (rarely 40%) of the clasts (Pl. 4.6B and C). 
Roundness changes gradually from sub-rounded/sub-angulose at the base to rounded/well 
rounded at the top. Clast size reaches a maximum of ca. 50cm in the thickest beds. These 
conglomerates are generally similar to facies association SG2. Conglomerates are 
dominant over the sandstones at the GRA and VMO sections and subordinate at the ALG 
section. Sandstones and more rarely mudstones appear at the top of and within 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

136

conglomerate beds from which they grade into, but also as separate beds, usually with 
sharp basal contacts. Sandstone scour fills within conglomerate packages are much more 
abundant than in the underlying subunit. Sandstone beds are initially thick (&gt;2m) massive, 
often pebbly, usually with a coarser base (occasionally gravelly) and grade to medium 
sized sand at the top (74 to 104m at the GRA section; undefined at the VMO section; 10 to 
55m at the ALG section). Frequently (especially at the GRA section) these beds grade 
from conglomerates (described above) and seem to be genetically related. Some of these 
are associated as couplets, a few decimetres thick, forming tabular packages with sharp 
contacts (Pl. 4.6E, G). These sandstones ± conglomerates (some similar to facies 
association SG2) are defined as facies association SG3. Miall’s facies codes associated 
with this facies association are Gh and Sh and more rarely Gcm, Gci and Ss (see Fig. 4.2, 
4.3 and 4.7). To the top of the unit sandstone beds tend to be thinner (&lt;2m), with 
horizontal lamination (although often crude), each bed grading from coarse/medium sand 
at the base to fine sand at the top, occasionally topped by a massive or laminated grey 
mudstone layer – facies association SG4 (Pl. 4.6E). These mudstone layers are, especially 
at the ALG section, organic matter-rich and some contain recognizable plant remains (as 
described by Wagner et al., 1983). Associated Miall’s facies codes are Sh, Fsm and more 
rarely Fl and Ss (see Fig. 4.2, 4.3 and 4.7). 

The characteristic red colour of the sandstones may in fact be, at least partially, a 
result of recent weathering and/or diagenesis. Commonly the red colour is restricted to an 
outer centimetrical layer of rock while its core is grey or whitish.  

This subunit is ca. 70m at the GRA section; over 140m at the VMO section (top not 
observed) and over 64m at the ALG section – the type section (top not observed). 

In terms of formal units the above described subunit can be considered the second 
member of the Algeriz Formation, provisionally called Parada Member (best exposed 
along the road from Algeriz to Parada). The lower limit is arbitrarily defined as the first 
relatively thick (&gt;1m) sandstone bed. The most characteristic features are the red coloured 
sandstones interbedded, in different proportions, with red coloured clast-supported 
conglomerates with rounded clasts. The upper limit is defined as the first thick (&gt;5m) grey 
mudstone bed (first grey measure of the Vale da Mó Member of the Monsarros Fm. – see 
below).

The Algeriz Fm., composed by the Gralheira and Parada Members, is 143m thick at 
the GRA section; over 160m thick at the VMO section; over 72m at the ALG section and 
over 32m at the SAL section. 

Wagner et al. (1983) defined the Vale da Mó Fm. based on a ca. 40m long section 
near the village of Algeriz and named it after another village around which outcrops of this 
formation are common (Vale da Mó). No other sections were presented. Within the 
Monsarros Fm. several sections up to 20m thick composed of finely laminated, organic 
matter-rich mudstones can be observed, especially at the VMO section. These sections are 
extremely similar to the Vale da Mó Fm. in terms of facies association and differ 
essentially in their vertical extent. The identification and differentiation of the Vale da Mó 
Fm. outside its type area is thus difficult, especially when detailed mapping of the basin is 
performed and may even lead to erroneous structural interpretations. Thus it is proposed to 
redefine the Vale da Mó Fm. as a Member of the Monsarros Fm (Table 4.3). The vertical 
extent is badly constrained as there is no section where its base and top are visible. It is 
probably restricted to less than 100m.

Table 4.2 – Facies associations defined for the Buçaco basin sediments and their main characteristics 
and vertical and lateral distribution. 

The Vale da Mó Member was only positively identified in this work along a road 
cut outside the village of Algeriz (road to Junqueira). It is uncertain if this is the same 
section described by Wagner et al. (1983). About 20m were logged and the remaining 
section showed only a repetition of the same sequence (Fig. 4.7). The base of this Member 
can be observed at the GRA section. The thin sand-mud tops of conglomeratic beds of the 
Algeriz Fm. become increasingly thicker and richer in organic matter. The first thick 
(&gt;5m) mudstone bed is considered to define the base of this Member (at 144m of the GRA 
section - see Fig. 4.2). The facies association of this Member can be generally included in 
type FP1: grey to dark grey fine sandstone to claystone beds, usually finely laminated, but 
occasionally massive. Plant-derived debris are common, from small coal fragments up to 
decimetrical, well preserved plant fragments (Pl. 4.7A and C). Thin (&lt;20cm) fining-
upward cycles are very common. Thin coal seams are occasionally observed at the top of 
these cycles. Coarser grained lithologies are rare, but may be observed at the base of 
thicker cycles. This facies association is observed throughout the Monsarros Fm., at the 
ALG section and more commonly at the VMO section. Associated Miall’s facies codes are 
Fl, Fsm and more rarely C and Sm (see Fig. 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.12). The 
CRI section shows a slightly different type of fine grained lithofacies. Very thin cycles (10 
to 20cm) of sand (coarse to medium) grading to shale or silt, frequently topped by an 
extremely thin coal layer: facies association FP2. These are interbedded with thick 
conglomeratic beds but apparently are not grading from them (see Fig. 4.12 and Pl. 4.7B). 
It is only observed in the Monsarros Fm. 

The subunit overlying the Vale da Mó Member is composed of a long sequence of 
considerably monotonous coarse fluvial sediments. In both VMO and ALG sections, the 
sequence is characterized by successive m-thick fining-upward cycles. The base of the 
cycles is almost invariably conglomeratic, usually with erosive basal contacts which 
sometimes erode significant parts of the underlying cycle. The conglomerates fine up to 
sandstones and are frequently topped by mudstones occasionally with coal seams (facies

138

association FP1). The proportion of conglomerate/sandstone/mudstone varies from cycle to 
cycle. The sequence is generally coarser at the ALG section than at the VMO section 
where sandstones and mudstones are more abundant. The conglomerates are almost 
invariably clast-supported, composed by quartz and quartzite clasts, although other 
lithologies occur such as black schist, meta-sandstones and mafic rocks. The proportion of 
black schist is low for most of the sequence (ca. 5%), but there are “abundance peaks” in 
several parts of the ALG section. The abundance of these clasts shifts progressively from 
very rare to about 20% and then suddenly increases, from one cycle to the next, up to 
100% total clast components. The peak is usually followed by a sharp decline, but the 
proportion of schist clasts can remain relatively high (ca. 20%) in the following cycles (see 
Fig. 4.13 and Pl. 4.7E and F). It is interesting to note that at least in two occasions the 
increased proportion of schist clasts is preceded by an increase in maximum clast size. The 
same is observed in the basal part (Gralheira Member) of the VMO section. This part of 
the sequence is defined as the Serradinho Member of the Monsarros Fm. (small group of 
houses named Serradinho where the type section is located, W of Algeriz village). It is 
over 500m thick at the VMO section, 460m at the ALG section and over 400m at the CRI 
section.

There are two main facies associations that can be defined in this member (apart 
from the FP1 and FP2 described above): GR1 and GR2. GR1 is characterized by clast 
supported conglomerates, usually with rounded to well-rounded quartzite and quartz clasts, 
that fine up to sandstones which are usually restricted to a relatively thin interval. The 
conglomeratic part is massive, with crude bedding-parallel lamination or with planar or 
trough cross beds (observed solely in gravel-conglomerates).

Imbrication of clasts is seldom seen (Pl. 4.7E). Associated Miall’s facies codes are 
Gh, Gt, Gp, Sp and Sr and more rarely Gcm and Ss. The colour of the beds is white, yellow 
or light brown. Clast surfaces are clean. Maximum clast size is usually about 10cm, but 
beds with coarser elements exist. This facies association is observed at the CRI, ALG and 
VMO sections. The lower part of the Serradinho Member were this facies association is 
dominant, along with FP1, probably corresponds to unit 4 of Courbouliex (1972, 1974) - 
Les conglomérats et schistes gris. GR2 is quite similar but differs in having generally 
higher maximum clast size (although highly variable between and within cycles); a red 
patina on clast surfaces (and frequently reddish core, especially schist clasts) and reddish 
sandstone tops; worse roundness (and especially mixing of rounded and angular clasts); 
massive or inverse grading and generally higher matrix/clast ratio (Pl. 4.7G). Associated 
Miall’s facies codes are Gh and Sr, but also Gcm and Gci. This facies association is 
restricted to the uppermost part of the Monsarros Fm (referred to here as Monsarros Fm. 
upper facies). It is observed at the ALG and VMO sections and possibly at the CRI section 
(only sandstones are observable). Similarly to the Algeriz Fm. the origin of the ferric 
staining seems, at least partially, due to diagenesis or recent weathering. However the red 
patina of the clasts seems to be originated by surface processes prior to burial. The upper 
part of the Serradinho Member were this facies association is dominant probably 
corresponds to unit 5 of Courbouliex (1972, 1974) - Les conglomérats à interbancs gris ou 
rouges. These differences are not considered to be relevant enough to erect a new Member 
for the Monsarros Fm. Both GR1 and GR2 commonly grade upwards to facies association 
FP1.
 The following lithological columns from sections in the Buçaco basin are presented 
from N to S. Base of the sequence is always on the lower left and top on the upper right. 
The number of meters between parts of the columns or at their base represent the estimated 
thickness of sequence missing. Va, a, sa, sr, r, wr refer to the visual estimated roundness of 
the clasts in the conglomerates: very angulose, angulose, sub-angulose, sub-rounded, 
rounded, well rounded, respectively.

4.3.2 Palaeocurrents and provenance of sediments 
 Palaeocurrent directions were measured at the ALG and VMO sections (exclusively 
from the Serradinho Member). Most of the measurements were made in sandstones or 
gravel conglomerates, predominantly on cross bedding structures but also in ripple marks 
observed on bedding planes. At the ALG section these show very consistent directions 
mainly to SW and S. The measurements made on imbricated clasts of coarser 
conglomeratic beds (e.g. Pl. 4.7E) showed a considerable dispersal of directions, 
essentially discordant with the directions obtained from the finer beds (see Fig. 4.14). A 
similar dispersal of data was observed at the VMO section where most of the 
measurements were made on imbricated clasts of coarse conglomerates. The main 
directions are to the S and ESE, closer to the basin’s main trend, but still highly disperse 
(see Fig. 4.14).

measurements when plotting data. For the Algeriz section the grey denotes measurements of 
imbricated clasts and black for cross bedding and ripples on sandstones. The VMO section 

measurements are mostly from imbricated clasts.

Fig. 4.15 – Distribution of palaeocurrent measurements through the ALG section (Serradinho 
Member) and its azimuthal variation. Note the concentration of azimuthal directions between ca. 160 
to 250º (SSE to WSW), despite the considerable dispersal. Thickness (x axis) is correlatable with the 

thickness (y axis) of Fig. 4.13. 

 The azimuthal variation of palaeocurrent directions is significant, but a consistent 
mode between ca. 160 to 250º (SSE to WSW) is observed at the ALG section (Serradinho 
Member). No significant changes or shifts are identified and thus the main transport 
direction seemed to have remained essentially unchanged for the whole duration of the 
deposition of the Serradinho Member. 

4.3.3 Organic Petrology and thermal history 
 Several palynological residues and picked coal fragments were mounted in epoxy 
blocks, polished, observed and measured using the methods described in Chapter 2. 
Vitrinite particles were abundant in all samples which allowed a good number of 
measurements to be made (Table 4.4). Inertinite particles were common in several samples 
(semifusinite, micrinite and more rarely macrinite and fusinite) and often difficult to 
distinguish petrographically from vitrinite. These frequently plotted as a separate group 
with reflectance values between 1,3 and 1,5% Rr (Pl. 4.7H). Some samples had vitrinite 
particles showing evidences of oxidation, especially around the edges and occasionally the 
entire surface (irregular, sometimes pitted surface).  Measurements on these particles were 
avoided. Most vitrinite particles can be classified as collotelinite. Preserved cellular 
structures were seldom observed. Sporinite was rare in most samples. Polymaceralic 
particles were very rare. Alginite particles were not observed.

Measurements of Random Vitrinite Reflectance (Rr) show that most samples have 
averages around 1%. It should be mentioned that frequently the histograms showed a 
bimodal distribution, usually with a dominant population around 1% and another close to 
0,8% (which seems to dominate is samples ALG4.1, 6.1, 8.1 and VMO7.6). The same 
bimodal distribution was described by Flores et al. (2010) although they found the 0,8% Rr 
population to be dominant in their samples.

Table 4.4 – Samples from the Vale da Mó (VMO) and Algeriz-Monsarros (ALG) sections, 

covering the Algeriz and Monsarros Formations. “sed” denotes picked coal fragments and “hf” 
palynological residue obtained from HF dissolution. Thickness corresponds to the position of the 

sample in the compiled lithological columns of Fig. 4.13. Equations used to estimate maximum 
temperatures (Tp) are: Barker (1988): Tp = ((LnRr)x104)+148; Barker &amp;amp; Pawliewicz (1986): Tp = 

((LnRr)+1.2)/0.0078; Barker &amp;amp; Goldstein (1990): Tp = (((LnRr)+1.26)/0.00811)*0.965)+12.1. 

Additional samples were processed from the CRI section, and from an isolated 
outcrop of the (?)Monsarros Fm. in the GRA section (not shown here). Most of the 
samples were too oxidized to be measured. Two samples however, one from CRI and 
another from the GRA section provided enough measurable particles. The mean vitrinite 
reflectance values obtained are also around 1%.

Tentatively the results could be used to determine palaeogeothermal gradients, by 
plotting thickness Vs Rr% or Maximum palaeotemperature. There is a badly defined trend 
with similar values in both VMO and ALG sections, but correlation values (R2) are 
extremely low (around 0,1) due to the significant dispersal of mean values. Additional 
samples covering the whole sequence are needed to be able to properly estimate 
palaeogeothermal gradients.

sections. Error bars based on standard deviation values. 

4.3.4 Clay mineralogy analysis 
Samples were collected extensively from the ALG section (identical to the 

palynology samples) and its&amp;lt;4µm fraction analyzed in an X-ray diffractometer (see 
methods section and Chapter 2). Additional samples were collected and analyzed from the 
GRA section (mostly red sandstones), VMO section (red sandstones and siltstones and 
grey shales and siltstones – palynology samples) and from the CRI section (one red 
sandstone and one grey siltstone). 
 Nearly all samples were composed of varying amounts of quartz, kaolinite and illite 
(mostly 2M1 polytype, occasionally muscovite). Chlorite occurs in vestigial amounts 
(&lt;5%) rather consistently in samples of the Algeriz formation (especially at the ALG 
section) and more sparsely in the Monsarros Fm. A single sample from the most basal part 
(near the contact with the basement) of the VMO section had ca. 30% chlorite group 
minerals and no kaolinite. A few samples of the basal formation also had vestigial amounts 
of oxides (hematite), gypsum and nepouite (genthite). Feldspars (s.l.) occur sparsely in the 
Algeriz Fm. (up to 10%) and very rarely in the overlying Formation. The proportion of 
quartz/kaolinite/illite varies considerably within the Algeriz Fm., with quartz and illite (and 
sometimes muscovite) usually dominating the mineralogical composition, while within the 
Monsarros Fm. this proportion remains very constant throughout the section. The 
illite/kaolinite (I/K) ratio is high and highly oscillating within the Algeriz Fm. and 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

gradually decreases until it reaches 0 at the base of the Vale da Mó Member. From that 
point it gradually increases until around 1 and oscillates gently to the top of the Monsarros 
Fm. 
 Another relevant finding is the presence of vermiculite up to ca. 8% in several 
successive levels of the Monsarros Fm. 

4.3.5 Palynology 
 Samples were collected preferably from grey or dark grey shally siltstones or 
shales. These occurred at the top of fining-upward cycles, frequently just bellow thin coal 
seams that occasionally topped the cycles. All collected samples provided a good amount 
of organic residue from which several slides of the unsieved and &gt;53µm fractions were 
produced. Residues were observed un-oxidized and with mild oxidation using low 
concentrated bleach. All of the assemblages were dominated by phytoclasts. Most of them 
showed some degree of corrosion, probably originated from weathering and sparse Fe- 
oxide mineralization observed at the outcrop and possibly from sedimentary transport and 
early diagenesis (?bacterial decay). 11 samples from the ALG section provided observable 
sporomorphs, although samples from the Algeriz Fm. only showed rare and poorly 
preserved sporomorphs. Over 100 taxa were identified in total, although many restricted to 
generic level. This limitation was particularly evident for grains attributable to genera 
Potonieisporites, Florinites and Schopfipollenites which were the most abundant 
palynomorphs. 6 samples from the Serradinho and Vale da Mó Members of the ALG 
section provided determinable sporomorphs. 4 of them had relatively common, moderately 
to poorly preserved sporomorphs and 2 had very abundant, moderately to well preserved 
sporomorphs. 3 samples from the Serradinho Member of the VMO section and one form 
the CRI section provided rare and very poorly preserved sporomorphs. Rare reworked 
acritarchs were recorded in some of the samples from the ALG section. 
 The samples providing diversified assemblages were dominated by Potonieisporites
spp., Florinites spp., Schopfipollenites spp. and Laevigatosporites spp. Other common 
genera are Cheiledonites spp., Densosporites spp. (decreasing abundance towards the top), 
Crassispora spp. (not present in the uppermost sample), Dictyotriletes-like sporomorphs 
(mostly fragments), Lycospora spp. (slight decrease towards the top), Thymospora spp., 
Verrucosisporites spp. and Wilsonites spp. 
 The presence of Potonieisporites novicus, P. bhardwajii and Cheiledonites major
along with the considerable abundance of the two genera are indicative of the 
Potonieisporites novicus-bhardwajii – Cheiledonites major (NBM) miospore biozone of 
Clayton et al., 1977. The decrease of the frequency of Densosporites spp. and the 
disappearance of Crassispora konsakei (and all Crassispora spp.) to the top of the 
sequence are further indications of this biozone. Other relevant genera such as 
Spinosporites, Thymospora and Triquitrites have fairly constant frequencies throughout the 
sequence. Vittatina spp. and Disaccites non striatti are also present throughout but always 
rare to frequent. 

4.4 Discussion and conclusions 
 The Gralheira Member is composed solely of continental gravity-driven 
sedimentary deposits. It seems to have all the characteristic features of alluvial fans formed 
at a distinct break in topography in a sub-aerial setting (see Nichols, 1999; Prothero &amp;amp; 
Schwab, 1996 for a revision). The sequence starts with matrix-supported breccias and

157

conglomerates (SG1 facies association) with very rare sandstone intercalations, indicative 
of plastic to pseudo-plastic debris-flows (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988). The overlying 
conglomerates are mostly clast-supported (SG2 facies association). The transport 
mechanism remains essentially gravitational, with more water- and clast-rich material 
being transported in an essentially pseudo-plastic flow (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988). The increase 
of quartzite and quartz clasts over the schist along with the improvement of the roundness 
and the decrease of ferruginization suggests that the material available in the drainage 
basin changed gradually from local deeply weathered rocks with little or no transport to 
mildly weathered, transported and moderately sorted material.  

The Parada Member continues to have pseudo-plastic debris-flow deposits, but it 
probably includes another type of gravitational transport mechanism. The sandstones with 
gravelly bases and fine sand to mudstone tops may be indicative of sheet-flood events 
(SG4 facies association) (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988; Nichols, 1999). The characteristic gravel 
(or coarser)-sand couplets are observed in facies association SG3 and the meter scale beds 
with normal grading and horizontal lamination are common in this member, especially 
towards the top. Antidune cross-stratification was not observed. The basal massive and 
pebbly sandstones are probably associated with debris-flow events that grade to sheet 
flood- or even stream-flow type of transport that deposits the finer material (SG3 facies 
association) (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988; Nichols, 1999). Both SG3 and SG4 facies associations 
occur throughout at the GRA section, while SG4 facies association dominates most of the 
basal part of the ALG section. The mudstone top of some of the sandstone beds indicates 
that towards the end of sheet-flood and even some debris-flow events there was a calmer, 
probably stream flow-dominated transport and deposition phase (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988; 
Nichols, 1999; Wells &amp;amp; Harvey, 1987). Where these mudstone layers are organic matter-
rich and laminated (mostly at the ALG section), a standing water body must have remained 
for a considerable amount of time. These are possibly incipient abandoned channel and 
possibly flood plain deposits which are greatly developed in the overlying formation. 
Overall there is a clear trend indicating an increase of the amount of water in the 
sedimentary system. Rather than a climatic change, this trend can be easily explained by an 
expansion of the catchment area as erosion took place. 

The overlying Monsarros Fm. shows evidences of sedimentation where stream-flow 
type of transport prevailed (Fritz &amp;amp; Moore, 1988). The Vale da Mó Member as well as 
other parts of the sequence where FP1 facies association is observed seem to have been 
deposited in an environment with a standing water body to allow the deposition of m-thick, 
often laminated mudstones. The nature of this water body is uncertain and may vary 
depending of the characteristics and vertical extent of the mudstone intervals. The short 
intervals of finely laminated mudstone interbedded with coarse conglomerates may be 
associated with flood deposits/overbank fines that deposited in the final stages of flooding 
events (Brookfield, 2004). The thicker, usually organic matter-rich, mudstone intervals 
probably result from longer periods of lacustrine-type of sedimentation, not restricted to 
one event or season. The possible basin-wide extent and lateral correlation of these 
intervals is difficult to assess confidently. It is possible that these deposits correspond to 
back swamp/abandoned channel sediments where peat could form. The fact that most of 
the coal seams are at the top of these FP1 facies association intervals, directly bellow the 
base of another conglomeratic cycle, is indicative of an autogenic control (sensu Miall, 
1996), related with the fluvial dynamics (e.g. channel avulsion – Catuneanu, 2006; Jones &amp;amp; 
Schumm, 1999) and not with external factors such as tectonism.



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

158

Seasonal events probably controlled the development of the intrabed thin cycles 
(&lt;20cm). The surfaces bounding these cycles probably correspond to 3rd order bounding 
surfaces sensu Miall (1996). The FP2 facies association identified at the CRI section has 
several characteristics of turbidity current type of sedimentation. The thin cycles 
commonly have a coarser massive base followed by a cross bedded fine sand/silt interval 
and topped by finely bedding parallel laminated organic matter-rich shale or coal. If truly 
turbidites, this would imply the existence of a perennial lake. It is difficult to explain the 
sharp lower and upper contacts of these intervals with the coarse conglomeratic beds. Dinis 
&amp;amp; Reis (2007) interpreted these conglomerates and lake shoreface deposits, but no 
significant differences were found between these and other conglomeratic beds of the 
VMO and ALG sections which are clearly of fluvial nature.

Within the Serradinho Member the dominant GR1 facies association is indicative of 
fluvial type of sedimentation, probably a braided system (Prothero &amp;amp; Schwab, 1996). The 
meter scale fining-upward cycles may reflect lateral shifts of the main channels of the 
fluvial system. The erosional surfaces bounding these cycles probably correspond to 4th or 
5th order bounding surfaces, sensu Miall (1996). To the top of the Monsarros Fm., the 
appearance of GR2 facies association is indicative of an increased importance of gravity 
driven sediment transport. Several fining-upward cycles have matrix-supported 
conglomerates and inverse grading can be observed in several instances. GR2 facies 
association shows some similarities with SG2 facies association although the main 
transport mechanism is probably stream-flow. The red patina is indicative of more intense 
weathering of the rocks prior to their burial. This change can be tentatively explained by 
renewed tectonic activity in the catchment areas. The mixing of rounded and well rounded 
clasts (dominant in the underlying sequence) and sub-angulose to angulose clasts suggests 
that the previously available catchment areas are still supplying sediments, but others 
became available as the surrounding relief was renewed. 

The influence of tectonism on the Buçaco basin can be detected in two main scales 
of events. The appearance of a trench along an important fault zone, either by a simple 
fault escarpment or a fully developed releasing bend (originating a pull-apart basin – see 
Flores et al., 2010 and Gama Pereira et al., 2008) promoted the onset of sedimentation. The 
same scale of events probably originated the end of sedimentation as the basin and 
surrounding areas were compressed and deformed, leading to the current synclinal 
structure (Domingos et al., 1983; Gama Pereira et al., 2008). These compressive events 
may explain the increased relevance of gravity driven sedimentation of the uppermost part 
of the Monsarros Fm. Another scale of tectonic events is probably related to the sudden 
shifts of transported lithologies. These could be related with small fault movements 
exposing different lithologies in the catchment areas subsequently eroded and deposited in 
the basin (compare for example Wagreich &amp;amp; Strauss, 2005). Only the peaks of schist clasts 
abundance described above can be used to trace these events although they were probably 
more frequent. Fault movements exposing yet more quartzite- or quartz-bearing rocks 
would not result in detectable changes in the basin’s sedimentary record. Both scales of 
events seem to be non-periodic. The meter scale fining-upward cycles and especially the 
significant changes in maximum clast size could suggest some tectonic influence, but are 
easily explained by simple fluvial system dynamics processes such as channel avulsion 
(Catuneanu, 2006; Jones &amp;amp; Schumm, 1999) 

The palaeocurrent data show an overall trend of flow direction to the S and SW 
which is concordant with the provenance data obtained from the lithologies identified on 
the conglomerates: Quartzite and quartz dominating throughout and variable amounts of

159

black schist and other metapelites and metasandstones and rare mafic igneous rocks. All of 
these can be correlated with CXG and Ordovician units presently exposed to the E, in the 
CIZ. The Algeriz Fm. has the same transported lithologies. The pre-Pennsylvanian units 
presently cropping out to the W of the basin (Albergaria-a-Velha and Arada units –referred 
to as “Complexo Cristalofílico” in older literature) were probably not exposed during the 
deposition of the Buçaco Basin. Although there are black schist clasts that could be 
potentially correlated with these units, after extensive sampling of schist-rich 
conglomeratic beds not a single clast could be positively identified as belonging to the 
Albergaria-a-Velha unit. The differentiation of the several schistose units outcropping in 
this area is certainly difficult, but after the examination of hundreds of outcrops of the 
Albergaria-a-Velha and Arada units in the course of this work a critical eye is capable of 
such differentiation. In addition several clasts of these schists (the most similar with the 
Albergaria-a-Velha unit) were processed for palynology. The amount of organic matter 
was negligible, similar to palynology samples collected from dark grey and black schists of 
the CXG in this area and further North. The Albergaria-a-Velha unit consistently produces 
residues with considerable amounts of amorphous organic matter and commonly spores 
and microplankton (even if only fragmentary).  

The source of sediments is clearly from the E (current coordinates) but the sediment 
transport in the basin seems to be closer to the main strike (N-S). Thus it is likely that the 
fluvial systems had catchment areas developing in the CIZ, eroding and transporting 
sediments to W (and SW?) into the basin and deflected to SW and S within the basin. 

The dextral sense of the PTSZ (e.g. Chaminé et al., 2003; 2007) very likely altered 
the original orientation of the measured planes and lineaments. The amount of rotational 
(clock-wise) movement is uncertain. 

Wagner et al. (1983) reported a schist-rich breccia bed at the ALG section resting 
unconformably over the “Complexo Cristalofílico”. This outcrop was not observed. 
Additionally the contact between the two units in this area corresponds to a valley with no 
outcrops. The contact of the two units has been investigated in several sections in the area. 
Although outcrop conditions are poor, the contact is invariably materialized by a fault 
(visible along a road trench near Monte Novo and along road cuts near Buçaco). Ribeiro 
(1893) describes the same type of contact. He states that the “Complexo Cristalofílico” 
thrusts over the Pennsylvanian-Permian sediments prior to the deposition of the Triassic 
sediments (which lie unconformably over both units). Our observations are consistent with 
this interpretation. 

The XRD results allow a differentiation of two main groups of clay mineralogy 
compositions. The first, corresponding to the Algeriz Fm., is characterized by varying 
proportions of illite and quartz, significant amounts of kaolinite, sparse occurrence of 
feldspars and chlorite, and vestigial and rare presence of gypsum, oxides (hematite) and 
nepouite. The presence of muscovite, 2M1 illite and quartz are indicative that at least an 
important part of the clay fraction is inherited (Weaver, 1989). Wagner et al. (1983) 
suggest that the basal formation includes a significant proportion of soil, eroded during 
high-energy transport episodes. The presence of oxides and nepouite could indicate the 
presence of Oxisols in the source area (Dixon, 1998; Weaver, 1989), thus a prevailing hot, 
humid palaeoclimate (e.g. Soil Survey Staff, 1998). The main erosional products of low 
relief areas covered by oxisols, transported by fluvial systems, are solutes and very fine 
grained material (Weaver, 1989). In the case of the Buçaco basin the source area is 
suspected to be at a considerably higher ground (Wagner et al., 1983, Wagner and Sousa, 
1983) and specifically for the Gralheira and Parada Members, the type of sedimentation is 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

160

clearly gravitational, with little water (debris-flows and sheet-floods). The red beds of the 
Algeriz Fm. could, at first glance, indicate a hot arid palaeoclimate (see, for example, a 
review of arid continental depositional environments in Nichols, 1999). A closer look 
reveals the presence of thin, dark grey, organic matter-rich, siltstones and sandstone beds 
within the Algeriz Fm., probably resulting from ponds formed between the debris-flow and 
sheet-flood events. These ponds probably would not develop with a prevailing hot and dry 
palaeoclimate (Nichols, 1999) 

Higher in the sequence (Monsarros Fm.), the clay fraction mineralogy shifts 
gradually to a fairly constant pattern of similar amounts of quartz, illite and kaolinite. The 
more regular and less diversified composition of the clay fraction is indicative of a greater 
chemical and physical sorting of the transported rocks/minerals (Weaver, 1989). The 
decrease of the I/K ratio possibly reflects an increase of the amount of weathering in the 
source area and thus the amount of kaolinite transported by fluvial systems into the basin, 
considering that kaolinite is frequently the dominant component of soils derived from 
metamorphic rocks (Jonhson, 1970). Correlation between the relative amount of 
transported and sedimented kaolinite and intensity of weathering has been described for 
recent rivers (see Weaver, 1989 p. 200-205). The vertical sampling intervals are too wide 
to infer on specific causes for the observed trends. 

The palynology results indicate that the sediments of the Buçaco basin most likely 
range from the middle to upper NBM miospore biozone of Clayton et al., 1977, 
corresponding to late Stephanian (Late Stephanian C – Stephanian D in older literature 
(e.g. Clayton et al., 1977); Stephanian C in more recent literature). Considering the new 
division of the Carboniferous system (Heckle &amp;amp; Clayton, 2006) the age is probably Early 
Gzhelian. The definitive correlation of the global and west European divisions of the 
Carboniferous has not been achieved; compare for example the table in Heckle &amp;amp; Clayton 
(2006) and the correlation of the Time Scale Creator software based on data from the 
International Commission on Stratigraphy. Thus there is some uncertainty regarding the 
ascription of the Buçaco basin’s sediments to a globally-defined stage or part of a stage. 
The assemblages show no evidence of “Autunian” rocks being present in the basin (sensu 
lowermost Permian). 

The thermal history of this area, including the underlying lower Palaeozoic rocks 
and the overlying Lusitanian basin sequence was addressed by Uphoff (2005) who also 
discussed the possible oil play formed by these units. He considered that there were no 
considerable gaps and no erosion from the end of Buçaco basin sedimentation (Late 
Pennsylvanian) to the beginning of the sedimentation of the Mesozoic Lusitanian basin 
(Carnian (Late Triassic) – Grés de Silves Fm.). The angular unconformity separating the 
Buçaco basin rocks and the Grés de Silves Fm. indicates that the former was exposed by 
Late Triassic times. However the thermal maturity by that time in not known nor the depth 
to which it was buried. The data collected from the thin impure coal seams and 
palaeobotanical sites of the Grés de Silves Formation in the neighbouring area (Anadia and 
Lograssol) show Rr values between 0,85 and 1,1%. This is consistent the interpretation of 
Uphoff (2005) who considers that the maximum burial depth (and maximum temperature 
attained) of the Buçaco basin rocks occurred during the Mesozoic as the Lusitanian basin 
developed. However, the geodynamic setting of the Buçaco basin along an important shear 
zone and its plausible pull-apart structure (Gama Pereira et al., 2008; Flores et al., 2010) 
may suggest a pre-Late Triassic burial and exhumation history. The high heat flow and 
thus high geothermal gradients recorded and estimated in pull-apart basins, such as 
Pennsylvanian alluvial-fluvial basins of Northern Spain (e.g. Frings et al., 2004) would 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

161

result in an increased maturation at relatively shallow depths. Considering an extremely 
high geothermal gradient such as 85ºC/Km estimated for pull-part basins, it would require 
ca.2km of sediments to be deposited and completely eroded during a time interval of ca. 
72Ma (latest Pennsylvanian – Carnian) for the Buçaco basin rocks to reach their current 
maturation (Fig. 4.17 and 4.18). Alternatively the thrusting and later erosion of older rocks 
(Arada and Albergaria-a-Velha units – Ossa-Morena Zone) over the basin would produce 
the same effect (Fig. 4.17 and 4.18), but nappe structures of this magnitude are unknown 
for this area. Thus it is probable that the Buçaco basin underwent a burial and exhumation 
process prior to Late Triassic, but never reached the temperatures attained during the 
Mesozoic.
 A simple thermal and burial history model was constructed using Petromod1D by 
constructing a hypothetical well. The input data is compiled in table 4.5 and is based on 
Palain (1976) for the thicknesses and lithologies of the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic 
sequences (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) and Adloff et al. (1974) for the corresponding 
ages. Calibration data for Triassic and Pennsylvanian rocks (temperature) derives from 
vitrinite reflectance data presented in this chapter.

Abstract  
 The Santa Susana basin (SSB) is a Pennsylvanian continental basin located along 
an important N-S strike shear zone that separates the Ossa-Morena and South Portuguese 
Zones (SW Portugal). The shear zone controlled the basin’s sedimentation and probably 
its post-sedimentary evolution. Fluvial sedimentation prevailed, but lacustrine sediments 
can be found in restricted areas in the basin’s upper unit. Palynological and 
palaeobotanical data indicate that at least part of the sedimentation took place during the 
Kasimovian (lower Stephanian/Cantabrian) but the sporomorph content of different 
localities suggests that significantly older sediments (?Moscovian/Bashkirian - 
Westphalian B or C) may be present. The geometrical and temporal relations of the basin 
with the surrounding units are discussed.

5.1 Introduction and Previous work 
The Santa Susana Basin (SSB) is a Pennsylvanian continental basin, located along 

an important NNW-SSE to N-S shear zone separating the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ) to 
the East and the Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ) to the West (Almeida et al., 2006; Domingos 
et al, 1983; Oliveira et al., 2007; Sousa and Wagner, 1983) (Fig. 5.2). The basin rests over 
older OMZ units, namely the Toca da Moura volcano-sedimentary complex (Gonçalves, 
1983; Oliveira et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2006; Santos et al., 1987) and the Grupo de Cuba 
rocks (microdiorites and porphyry rocks) (e.g. Gonçalves, 1983, 1984/5) (see Table 5.1). 
The basal parts of the basin have conglomerates that contain porphyry boulders (Pl. 5.8c), 
but it is also cut by porphyry dykes, indicating their contemporaneousness (Andrade et al. 
1955; Gonçalves, 1983) (see Table 5.1).  

To the West the basin is separated from the Pulo do Lobo Group units of the South 
Portuguese Zone by the Santa Susana shear zone (SSSZ), an important regional structure 
that runs NNW-SSE (Almeida et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007), referred to as part of the 
Ferreira-Ficalho thrust in older literature (e.g. Gonçalves, 1983). Pulo do Lobo Group 
units (s.l.) include the Pulo do Lobo (phyllite, quartzite, acidic and basic metavolcanic), 
Ribeira de Limas (phyllites and metagreywackes), Santa Iria and Horta da Torre 
Formations (shales, siltstones and quartzites) (Garcia-Alcalde et al., 2002; Oliveira, 1983). 
This group of Formations is also referred to as Ferreira-Ficalho Group (e.g. Garcia-
Alcalde et al., 2002). 

The basin extends for over 15Km in length along a NNW-SSE direction and is 0.1 
to 1km wide. Significant parts of the basin, especially in its southern part, are covered by 
Tertiary deposits, but the true extent of the basin was revealed in the 1950s by borehole 
data. The Pego do Altar water reservoir has covered yet another part of the basin in the 
early 1950s. Nowadays there are 3 main outliers, from North to South: Jongeis (SUS 
sections), Remeiras (REM section) and Vale de Figueira (VFIG and ORD sections) (Fig. 
5.2). Other small areas exist to the South, but most are covered by Tertiary deposits and 
are known mainly from borehole data. 

The basin has several coal seams that were explored until 1944 (Sousa and 
Wagner, 1983). The Jongeis exploration (Jongeis outlier) was the largest and longest, but 
another smaller exploration was conducted near Vale Figueira de Baixo – called Moinho 
da Ordem mine (Vale de Figueira outlier). 

The study of this basin dates back to the 1800s when Bernardino Gomes first 
reported fossil plants from the basin and made the first taxonomic identifications (Gomes, 
1865). Lima conducted a second palaeobotanical study of the basin (e.g. Lima, 1895/98) 
attributing an age to the fossil sites. Later, Carlos Teixeira worked on several Portuguese 
Carboniferous fossil plant sites, including the SSB (Teixeira, 1938/40; 1940; 1944, 1945) 
and revised some of the work by Gomes and Lima and compared the assemblages with 
others found in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. More recently a series of papers by 
Wagner and Sousa have revised the taxonomy, stratigraphic significance and 
palaeobiogeography of the Iberian Carboniferous fossil macroflora including the Santa 
Susana assemblages (e.g. Sousa and Wagner, 1983; 1985). These authors attributed the 
assemblage to the “very late Westphalian D or earliest Cantabrian”. Most of the specimens 
described and re-described by these workers were from the Vale de Figueira locality in the 
southern part of the basin. Unfortunately all of these studies were based on spot sampling

of palaeobotanical sites and the collections have not been enlarged since Teixeira collected 
some specimens. These are stored at the Natural History Museum in Lisbon (Bernardino 
Gomes Collection), Museum of the Geological Survey in Lisbon (Carlos Teixeira 
Collection and part of the Wenceslau de Lima collection) and in the Wenceslau de Lima 
Museum in the Faculty of Sciences of the Porto University. Based on the work by Sousa 
and Wagner (1983) regarding the Santa Susana and Ervedosa (Douro area, N Portugal) 
basins, and compiling data from other Euramerican basins, Cleal (2008a, b) considered the 
assemblages from Portugal and NW Spain as a discrete group with close affinities with the 
Rhine and Silesia Palaeoprovinces. 

The basin’s stratigraphy has only been summarily described in some of the 
previous palaeobotanical studies and also in specific studies (e.g. Andrade, 1927/30; 
Andrade et al., 1955; Neiva, 1943) dealing with borehole data and with the characteristics 
of clasts in the conglomerates. The scarcity of studies on the basin’s stratigraphy can be 
explained by the paucity of continuous outcrops in the area except for some stream beds 
and reservoir banks.

their age. 

Facies analysis is difficult in most places due to the scarcity of outcrops and their 
poor continuity. Conglomerates (from boulder size to gravel) and dark grey siltstones and 
shales with occasional coal seams are quite common (e.g. Pl. 5.8b). Sandstones also 
appear in some localities. These have been interpreted as fluvial deposits by most authors, 
but a more detailed facies analysis was never performed. 

Only two brief notes were published concerning the palynology of the basin: 
Fernandes (1998; 2001). Both refer to samples derived from borehole cuttings (Fernandes, 
pers. com.) and the relatively diversified spore assemblage allowed an attribution to the 
Miospore biozones Angulisporites splendidus – Latensina trileta (ST) and/or Thymospora 
obscura – T. thiessenii (OT) of Clayton et al., 1977.

The basin’s geometry and tectonics have received little interest, despite the 
significant relevance of the area to the understanding of the whole region. Regional 
mapping conducted by the Geological Survey produced a short note (Carvalhosa &amp;amp; 
Zbyszewsky, 1994) and a glimpse of the structure was described in Domingos et al. 
(1983). More recently detailed structural and geological mapping of the northern area of 
the basin (Jongeis) and surrounding units has revealed a transtensive dextral tectonic style, 
along the SSSZ producing sedimentation in a pull-apart basin during the Pennsylvanian 
(Oliveira et al., 2007, Almeida et al., 2006). On-going work in the southern parts of the 
basin is showing a similar tectonic style.

5.2 Methods and materials 
As mentioned above there are few localities with sufficient exposure to construct 

lithological columns and properly interpret the sedimentary facies. Here 6 localities 
covering the 3 main outliers of the basin are described, although they certainly do not 
represent the whole sequence of each area (see Fig 5.2 for locations). All sections were 
sampled for palynology. Samples were processed using the methods described in Chapter 
2. Residues were mounted on glass slides and observed under a transmitted light 
microscope. A mild oxidation using low concentrated bleach was performed to render 
some  thicker-walled taxa translucent and observable under the microscope. 

Several palaeobotanical specimens were collected at the Vale de Figueira classical 
locality (Vale Figueira 1 to 5 section). The palaeobotanical collection stored at the 
Museum of the Portuguese Geological Survey (LNEG) appears to come from two 
different localities, probably from different sampling campaigns. One part comes from the 
Vale de Figueira locality (precise location is given with some specimens) and another 
from “Moinho da Ordem” which is a local landmark. The precise location of this site is 
unknown and possibly is now underwater. The matrix in which the fossils are found is a 
pink fine siltstone which was not recognized in the Vale de Figueira site. The collection at 
the Natural History Museum in Lisbon is restricted to about 6 small specimens with no 
reference of the sampling site. 

The palynological residues containing abundant phytoclasts were sieved through a 
63?m mesh, mounted and polished using a similar method to the one described in Hillier 
&amp;amp; Marshall (1988). Additional residues were mounted and polished from dark grey shales 
and siltstones samples of the Toca da Moura/Cabrela Complex described in Pereira et al., 
(2006) and Oliveira et al., (2006). Random mean vitrinite reflectance (Rr%) was measured 
in all samples using standardized methods (performed by Paulo Fernandes, UAlg). 

Further data presented here derives from the papers dealing with the extensive 
borehole campaign done from the 1930s up to the 1950s (Andrade 1927/30; 1955). 
Although executed or sponsored by the Portuguese Geological Survey there is neither 
record of them in the Survey’s archives, nor the cuttings or cores seem available. The logs 
and descriptions were systematized and used to construct cross sections in several areas of 
the basin (Fig. 5.2). Surface mapping, dips and other cartographic information was used to 
produce more accurate sections. 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

198

Palaeocurrent data was collected in the several sections mentioned above. 
Additional data was collected in small outcrops which were not logged but had enough 
exposure to be measured. The data derive from cross bedding structures in sandstones and 
fine conglomerates and from large oriented plant debris found in bedding surfaces 
(Ordem1 section). 

Several samples from the VFIG 1 to 5, VFIG 6, ORD (Ordem 1) and REM 
sections were selected for clay mineralogy analysis (same as for palynology analysis). The 
&lt;4?m fraction was decanted and mounted over a glass slide and left to dry at room 
temperature. The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded with a copper anode X-ray tube 
(Cu-K? radiation) using a Philips PW1710, powder diffractometer and X´Pert software 
PC-APD 3.6 in Aveiro University and in a similar equipment in the Tropical Research 
Institute (IICT) Department of Natural Sciences(DCN)/ Global Development(DES) in 
Lisbon. 

5.3 Results  

5.3.1 Lithostratigraphy 
 The same units presented in the simplified geological map were considered with 
the exception of the Santa Susana basin which was separated into two laterally 
correlatable units:  

1) Basal conglomeratic unit composed by a very coarse grained basal conglomerate 
with abundant “porphyry” boulders overlain by coarse sandstones and polygenic 
conglomerates. Finer grained rocks and coal seams are rare. Outcrops of this unit 
are rare, but they can be found in the Remeiras outlier and along the Eastern edge 
of the Vale de Figueira outlier. 

2) Upper unit composed by sandstones, shales and coals. It contains all of the mined 
coal seams and provided all the palaeobotanical and palynological assemblages so 
far. Some quartz/quartzite-rich gravel conglomerates occur. Most of the surface 
area occupied by the Santa Susana basin corresponds to this unit. 

The separation of the two units was arbitrarily defined by the dominant proportion of 
coarse/fine grained sedimentary rocks. Although prone to some uncertainty, the shift from 
a coarse-grained dominated sequence (conglomerates and sandstones) to a fine-grained 
one (siltstones and mudstones) seems rather abrupt (within a few meters) and clearly 
unidirectional in all instances, probably corresponding to a considerable and rapid change 
of the sedimentary environment.

Unfortunately by the time the borehole campaign was performed and reports 
produced, the knowledge of the surrounding metamorphic units was scarce. Thus Andrade 
(1927/30; 1955) uses terms such as “Complexo Cristalofílico Ante-Cambrico” to describe 
the basement rocks of the basin, which basically refers to undifferentiated metamorphic 
and igneous rocks of the Ossa-Morena Zone. Other lithological references are “Porfirito” 
(which refers to the Grupo de Cuba felsic rocks (commonly referred to as Baleizão 
Porphyry – Ossa-Morena Zone), “Xisto Fameniano” (probably referring to the upper units 
of the Pulo do Lobo Group – South Portuguese Zone) and “Xistinhos” (referring to the 
slates of the Toca da Moura Complex – Ossa Morena Zone). Additional problems arise 
when the basement of Jongeis area is described as being “Xisto Fameniano”, thus South 
Portuguese Zone. All other wells found Ossa-Morena Zone units as the basement of the 
basin. No faults are described in the contact with the basement in Jongeis area. It is 
considered here, that this is probably a misidentification of metamorphic rocks of the 
Ossa-Morena Zone. Confirmation or rejection of this hypothesis is at this time impossible.  

5.3.1.2 Santa Susana sections – SUS (Jongeis outlier) 
As in other areas of the basin, outcrops and especially continuous sections are 

scarce. The Jongeis outlier has the additional problem of having large areas covered by 
mine tailings. Only two sections were considered to be appropriate for description and 
palynological sampling. Both belong to the SSB upper unit. 

Susana 5 
 This is a small section observable along the bed of a perennial stream. Several 
badly defined dm-thick fining-upward cycles can be observed. Gravel conglomerates 
grade to sandstones and mudstones (Fig. 5.3). Within the finer, upper part of the cycles, 
fine conglomeratic beds or lenses are common. The sandstone and mudstone beds 
frequently show bedding-parallel lamination and are grouped in cm to dm-thick fining-
upward cycles (Fig. 5.3; Pl. 5.8D). The classification of these cycles and its bounding 
surfaces according to ranks or orders (e.g. Miall, 1996) and the discussion on the 
geological processes that originated them is difficult due the limited extent and poor 
preservation of the section. This is probably a fluvial sequence.  

Susana 6 
 This is a long section logged on a vegetated hill slope. Observational gaps are 
extensive. The little information available derives from relatively resistant conglomeratic 
and sandstone beds and a few mudstone levels (Fig. 5.3). Although uncertain it seems the 
meter scale fining-upward cycles are present, as observed in other sections across the 
basin. The extensive gaps preclude further interpretations.

5.3.1.3 Remeiras section - REM (Remeiras outlier) 
 This is a small section observable along the bed of a perennial stream. The section 
is considerably weathered. Observational gaps are common, especially at the top of 
conglomeratic beds. These probably correspond to fine sandstone and mudstone levels that 
erode more easily. It seems that the same fining-upward cycles observed in other sections 
are present, but on a sub-metrical scale. The conglomerates’ clasts have an extremely 
varied origin: greenish slate, black slate, porphyry, psamitic metasediments, quartz, 
quartzite, basic rocks and coal fragments. Maximum clast size varies little throughout the 
section (2-4cm). A thin coal seam is observable at ca. 3m and plant fragments are 
commonly found in sandstone and mudstone beds. Cm- to dm-thick cycles can be 
observed, especially at the top of the section. These have a conglomeratic or coarse sand 
base and grade to fine sand at the top (Fig. 5.3). 

This sequence is probably fluvial, but with some differences to other sections. The 
greater diversity of lithologies and the presence of reworked coal in the conglomerates 
suggests that the source areas are quite diversified, extending to both Ossa-Morena and 
South Portuguese Zones and probably the basin itself.  

This is the only section attributable to the SSB lower unit, but it is uncertain if it is 
representative of the rest of the unit. Along the Eastern edge of the basin, where the lower 
unit is expected to be found, one can easily find outcrops of very coarse, porphyry rich 
conglomerates. The same is described from the borehole data (Andrade et al., 1955). 

5.3.1.3 Moinho da Ordem section - ORD (Vale de Figueira outlier) 
 A small section was logged in the northern bank of the Pego do Altar reservoir 
which is only observable during summer months. Outcrops in the area are not rare, but 
continuous sections do not abound.  
 The section is composed by a few 1 to 3m cycles of coarse conglomerates that 
grade into sandstones and occasionally topped by finely laminated fine sandstone to 
mudstone. The clast lithologies include slate, psamitic metasediments and porphyry, but 
quartz and quartzite dominate throughout. Clasts are generally sub-rounded and maximum 
size varies considerably within and between beds (from 20cm to 2cm). This section has 
abundant, very large, heavily oxidized plant remains, mostly impressions, preserved on 
sandstones over bedding surfaces. There is a clear coherent alignment of the remains (see 
palaeocurrents section). The reduced size and poor preservation preclude further 
interpretations. This section belongs to the SSB upper unit. 

5.3.1.4 Vale de Figueira Locality and sections - VFIG (Vale de Figueira 
outlier) 

The Vale de Figueira locality is referenced in the palaeobotanical collections of the 
Portuguese Geological Survey Museum that were probably sampled by Lima (or his field 
assistants) and later by Teixeira. At this locality there are several continuous sections (up 
to 100m thick) usually bounded by faults, but with slight internal deformation. Strong 
lateral variations in bed thickness and facies (few meters) can be observed where there is 
enough exposure.

VFigueira 1 to 5 
Several fining-upward cycles can be observed, starting with pebbly gravel 

conglomerates grading up to sandstones and topped by fine dark grey siltstones and 
shales, occasionally with coal seams (Fig.5.4; Pl. 5.8B, E, F). At the base of the section, 
the clasts of the conglomerates have a poor roundness (angulose to sub-angulose), grains 
are badly sorted and several lithologies make up the clasts in similar proportion 
(undifferentiated slate, quartzite, quartz, micas). Matrix content is high, although all 
conglomerates are clast-supported. To the top of the sequence, roundness becomes 
gradually better (up to rounded), with a marked increase of the proportion of quartz and 
quartzite clasts and decrease of matrix content. This gradual change is very irregular, with 
some conglomeratic beds (breccias) having very-angulose clasts, erosive bases, high 
diversity of clast lithologies and high matrix content (e.g. intervals 65-72m and 92-94m, 
Fig.5.4). Maximum grain size remains fairly constant throughout the sequence (3 to 4cm). 
Often mudstone, sandstone and even finer conglomeratic beds show very thin fining-
upward cycles. These are 10 to 20cm thick in finer conglomeratic beds, ca. 5cm in 
sandstones and&amp;lt;5cm in mudstones, down to ca. 1cm (Pl. 5.8H). This sequence is 
interpreted as deposits of a fluvial meandering system and associated flood plain and/or 
abandoned channel deposits. This section belongs to the SSB upper unit. 

Plant remains are found in all lithologies, but are concentrated in the siltstones and 
shales, frequently as fine debris, but occasionally as large (centrimetrical to decimetrical) 
remains (Pl. 5.8G). The top of the sequence is dominated by fossiliferous silts and shales 
which define the Vale de Figueira palaeobotanical site sensu stricto.  

VFigueira 6 
Another continuous section (over 30m) in the same area is composed solely of 

coaly siltstones and shales. Beds are laterally continuous and often have fine bedding-
parallel lamination (VFigueira 6 – Fig.5.4). This sequence is interpreted as deposits of a 
lacustrine environment. This section did not provide large, identifiable, plant remains so 
far. The section is bounded by faults in its base and top. This section belongs to the SSB 
upper unit. 

5.3.2 Geometry and architectural elements analysis 
To the South of the Remeiras outlier, borehole data show that both units of the 

basin are thicker in the West, i.e. closer to the SSSZ separating the SPZ and OMZ. 
Bedding (S0 in Fig5.2.) generally dips mildly to the W. This is very much in accordance 
with the model proposed by Oliveira et al. (2007) and Almeida et al. (2006) that considers 
a depocenter close to the SSSZ. However, in Remeiras and Jongeis outliers, the geometry 
is quite different: the thickest sequences (preserved) are to the E and, at least in Jongeis, 
bedding generally dips to the E. The thickness of the basin’s sedimentary sequences is 
considerably different when compared to the Southern parts of the basin:&amp;lt;200m in 
Jongeis and&amp;lt;75m in Remeiras, compared to the ~500m of the Vale de Figueira outlier 
Moreover, the whole area between Jongeis and Remeiras is composed by basement rocks 
and the Remeiras outlier is composed solely by the basal conglomeratic unit. It is plausible 
to assume that tectonics played a very important role in the post-sedimentary evolution of 
the basin, namely late Variscan and Alpine as suggested by Gonçalves (1983) and Oliveira 
et al. (2007). The reactivation of tectonic structures with ca. E-W alignment as 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

205

compressive faults probably promoted the exhumation and erosion of significant parts of 
the SSB, especially in the areas to the North (Jongeis and Remeiras). The same fault 
system probably controlled sedimentation during the Tertiary that covered most of the 
SSB in its Southern parts. The reactivation of the SSSZ with a reverse component in its 
Northern segment would easily explain the geometry observed in Jongeis and Remeiras, 
but evidence of this kinematics is unknown.  
 The interpretation of the available data from the architectural elements perspective 
is difficult due to the limited knowledge of the borehole data, poor exposure but also 
because some of the proposed methods for describing bounding surfaces and orders of 
sequences (e.g. Miall, 1996) are not directly applicable. The suggestion of Catuneanu 
(2006) is followed here and orders or ranks are defined for the bounding surfaces and 
groups of sedimentary packages/sequences according to the available data and 
characteristics of the basin. In this sense the following bounding surfaces are defined:

Table 5.2 – Summary table of the bounding surfaces and corresponding sequences defined for the 
SSB. Possible origin and the correlation with Miall’s classification scheme are tentative. 

The surface corresponding to the contact of the basin with the basement is defined as a 
1st rank boundary. It can be described from the sub-surface data for the whole basin (Fig. 
5.2). Its origin is linked to a major regional tectonic process during of late Variscan 
orogeny that promoted the appearance of topographic highs and trenches along the SSSZ 
(Oliveira et al., 2007; Almeida et al., 2006; see geological setting above). This surface can 
rarely be observed outcropping and is frequently tectonized. A discontinuous outcrop ca. 
50m to the NW of the Vale de Figueira de Baixo farm house is possibly the best example 
of this surface, where the basal conglomerate seems to rest over porphyry rocks (Pl. 5.8C). 
The erosional surface at the base of the Tertiary sequence is also defined as a 1st rank 
boundary. It is defined solely in the Vale de Figueira outlier and the southernmost 
outcrops (Fig. 5.2). Although this boundary corresponds to a defined cartographic 
geological limit, it was not observed outcropping. Its origin is related to the uplift and 
erosion of the basin and surrounding area. The regional uplift can be related with the 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

206

SSSZ, but the possible E-W strike group of compressive faults discussed above probably 
had a major role in the post-Pennsylvanian evolution of this area (see Gonçalves, 1983 
maps and interpretation). Considering Miall’s boundary classification scheme these 2 
boundaries would be 8th order boundaries. 

The boundary between the two units within the SSB is only tentatively defined as it is 
a rapid shift of the sedimentation characteristics and not a boundary or surface s.s. 
Furthermore, it can only be generally described from the data provided by Andrade et al. 
(1955) in their summarized descriptions of the borehole cores (Fig. 5.2). It is classified as 
a 2nd rank boundary. Its origin is probably due to a tectonic stasis or period of milder 
activity that promoted a shift from a sedimentation stage considerably dependant on the 
orographic characteristics of the surrounding area to a stage of more distal fluvial and 
lacustrine sedimentation. This change can also reflect a simple geomorphological change 
of the surrounding area as the main topographic highs were eroded. This surface can be 
tentatively associated with 6th or 7th order sequence boundaries (sensu Miall, 1982 in Miall 
1996). 

At the outcrop scale, the erosional surfaces bounding the m-scale conglomerate to 
mudstone cycles (often incomplete) are present in nearly all studied sections from both 
basal and upper units. These are classified as 3rd rank boundaries (Pl. 5.8B, E). Their 
origin is uncertain but can be connected with small tectonic pulses affecting the area. The 
changes in the clasts’ lithologies and roundness from one cycle to the next suggest 
changes of source areas. Alternatively these cycles and corresponding erosional surfaces 
can merely be related with the processes of the fluvial system such as channel avulsion 
(Jones &amp;amp; Schumm, 1999) 

These surfaces can be classified as 4th or 5th order bounding surfaces (sensu Miall, 
1982 in Miall, 1996).  

The bounding surfaces of the intra-bed cycles are classified as 4th rank boundaries. 
These are observed in all sections studied, mainly in sandstone, siltstone and shale beds, 
although some finer conglomeratic beds also showed this cyclicity (Pl. 5.8D, H). These 
are probably related with seasonal cycles and/or with year or 10s year-scale events such as 
floods. These surfaces are probably equivalent to the 3rd order boundaries of Miall (1982) 
in Miall (1996).  

 Higher rank boundaries can be defined such as sets and cosets of cross-bedding 
structures and specific levels within beds, but this is outside the scope of this study.  

5.3.3 Palaeocurrents and provenance data 
 The several sections measured are probably not coeval, distance several kilometres 
from each other and are questionably representative of each area and time interval. The 
reduced number of measurements, due to the poor exposure, precludes comprehensive 
interpretations and firm conclusions. The upper unit with sandstones and coals is over 
represented due to the scarcity of outcrops of the basal unit. Two main trends seem to 
exist. One, approximately E-W, possibly representing relatively proximal sediment 
transport from source areas located around the edges of the basin. The other, to the South, 
may represent more distal transport along the strike of the basin. 
 The dextral sense of the SSSZ which limits the current extent of the basin to the W 
very likely altered the original orientation of the measured planes and lineaments. The 
amount of rotational (clock-wise) movement is uncertain.

The lithologies eroded and deposited in the basin are easily recognizable in the 

conglomeratic beds that dominate the basal unit but also appear in the upper unit. The 
lithologies can be associated with known units and formations in Ossa-Morena and South 
Portuguese Zones. The basal conglomeratic unit rarely outcrops, but it very commonly 
shows large rounded boulders (up to 50cm) of the Grupo de Cuba Porphyry rocks. Several 
mine reports state that sills and dykes of this porphyry unit were observed to cut the 
basin’s sediments. Indeed one of the boreholes describes two sills cutting the basal 
conglomeratic unit. This was never observed by us. It seems that the magmatic activity 
that originated the porphyry unit was, at least in part, coeval with the initial stages of 
sedimentation. Porphyry and porphyry-derived rocks (possibly sub-aerial equivalents – 
see Gonçalves, 1983) probably dominated the landscape in this area and seem to have 
been the main source of material during initial basinal development. The conglomerates in 
the upper unit are dominated by quartz and quartzite clasts, but other lithologies are 
common. These include black and greenish slates, black cherts and psamitic 
metasediments. The following table links the lithologies found and the units and 
formations from which they derived 

The polygenic nature of the conglomerates shows that during the deposition of the 
SSB both South Portuguese Zone (to W current coordinates) and Ossa-Morena Zone (to E 
current coordinates) were exposed and being eroded, coherent with the palaeocurrent data.

5.3.4 Clay fraction mineralogy 
Most samples showed a strong distortion of the X-ray diffractogram due to the 

high content of very fine organic matter and probably organic acids that settled with the 
clay fraction. These samples were treated with low concentrated H2O2 for several days and 
remounted. All samples show a Quartz-Illite-Kaolinite composition, with varying 
proportions. Illite dominated in many samples (30 to 50%), but most had equal amounts of 
the 3 components. Vermiculite appeared in several samples as a minor component 
(&lt;10%). Its presence in fluvial/lacustrine sedimentary environments is difficult to explain. 
Weaver (1989, p.137-141) presents several case studies available in the literature were 
microbial (mostly fungal) activity in organic matter-rich settings promotes the 
transformation of clay minerals to vermiculite. Areas with stagnant water in flood plains 
could possibly provide an appropriate setting.  

Feldspars were also found in minor amounts (up to 11%) in the Ordem1 section. 
This may reflect a poorly mature nature of some of the deposits.  

No significant differences were found between the diffraction pattern of the 
samples from the VFigueira 6 section (interpreted as lacustrine) and the remaining fluvial 
sections. 

5.3.5 Palaeobotany 
The palaeobotanical site (Vale de Figueira) is composed of several levels of 

siltstone and shales with abundant large (decimetrical) plant remains at the top of a fluvial 
sequence. Fossils are found in the outcrop and associated floats. Other levels in lower 
parts of the sequence are also fossiliferous, but these usually have a worse preservation 
and lower abundance (Pl.5.8G). 

Most plant fossils are preserved as thin coaly films, but there are also low relief 
impressions and iron oxide replacement. Intermediate situations are common. 3D

preservation of stems, usually by silicification, is occasionally found in more coarse 
sediments such as sandstones and fine conglomerates (Pl.5.8G). 

The taxa described in the literature (Sousa and Wagner, 1983; 1985) are 
summarized in the following table.  

The fossil diversity analysis indicates that Lycophytes were probably the dominant 
group of the sedimentation area. All kind of lycophyte organs have been preserved in 
Santa Susana fossil record: leaves, stems, reproductive structures, recently rhizophores 
(Stigmaria sp.) were found. 

In terms of palaeoecology, Lycophytes dominated the peat-forming swamps of 
Carboniferous times (Taylor, 1981; Raven et. al, 1999). Others specimens present in Santa 
Susana fossil record can also be found in this type of environment. Sphenophyllum sp.
could occur both in lycophyte forest, as an understory shrub, or in over bank flood plain 
and lake deposits as a climbing plant which was locally abundant (Arens et al., 1998). 
Cordaites existed in the edges of lycophytes forests (Arens et al., 1998; Raven et al. 
1999), although it is thought to be ecological diverse and widely distributed (Raven et al., 
1999). Considering this, the possibility of downstream transportation of Cordaites cannot 
be excluded, since they are also common in other environments (Gall 1995; Taylor, 1981; 
Raven et al., 1999). 

 It is also relevant that arborescent sphenopsids and specimens belonging to 
Medullosales (Pteridospermophyta division) occurred in different environments. The 
arborescent sphenopsid Calamites sp. found at Vale de Figueira locality, are normally 
associated with moist and damp environments such as surrounding areas of lakes and 
streams and on point bars, along the edge of forest areas (Gall, 1995; Taylor, 1981; Raven 
et al. 1999). The Medullosans grew on levee banks of wandering rivers and streams (Gall, 
1995; Taylor, 1981). 

Since information about fossil site locations and abundance in Santa Susana basin 
is scarce it is difficult to infer on the initial source area of the plants. Organ diversity of 
Lycophytes can also imply that transport was not long, because the fragile reproductive 
structures were preserved (Gall, 1995). Environment divergence between arborescent 
sphenopsids and medullosans may possibly imply that there is more than one source area 
of plant remains or a single large area with different environments and their transitions 
(Gall, 1995).

5.3.6 Palynology and age of the assemblages 
Most of the processed samples were barren in terms of sporomorphs, although all 

yielded a significant amount of organic matter. Phytoclasts were dominant in all samples. 
Organic residues consistently showed signs of corrosion, probably due to weathering that 
promoted oxidation of organic matter. Only some samples from VFigueira 1 to 5 and Susana 5 
and 6 sections provided recognizable palynomorphs. 
 The biostratigraphical division of the Late Westphalian and Early Stephanian in terms 
of palaeobotany and palynology has been discussed for a long time (e.g. Cleal et al. 2003). 
Wagner (1966a, b) discussed the existence of a “Cantabrian” stage in NW Spain with 
characteristic macroflora that was not represented elsewhere in Europe. He argued that the 
base of the Stephanian corresponding to the Holz conglomerate (Saar-Lorraine coal field) 
represented a hiatus and that probably the upper part of the Westphalian D and the lower part 
of the Stephanian were missing. The same hiatus seemed to be present in other paralic basins 
across Europe. The later macrofloral biozonation of the Westphalian and Stephanian (Wagner, 
1984), revised by Cleal (1991) included considerable detail of the Westphalian-Stephanian 
boundary. Further refinement of the floral succession in this time interval was conducted by 
Cleal et al. (2003) who also discussed the application of the zonal scheme to areas outside the 
classical locality in NW Spain. 

The palynostratigraphical subdivision of this time interval was conducted in several 
areas in Europe a North America, mainly in basins containing coal fields and in some cases 
restricted to coal bearing intervals (e.g. Kosanke, 1950, Peppers, 1970). Regional zonal 
schemes were developed (e.g. Smith and Butterworth, 1967; Alpern et al., 1967a, b), but their 
correlation was not always completed. Clayton et al. (1977) proposed a Western Europe 
Carboniferous Miospore biostratigraphical scheme, compiling the available data from several 
basins in Europe. It is still in use today. The scheme was revised for the Mississippian and part 
of the Pennsylvanian sub-systems for some areas (e.g. Clayton et al., 2003; Mclean et al., 
2005; Owens et al., 2004, 2005). The official subdivision of the Carboniferous System (Heckel 
&amp;amp; Clayton, 2003) considered the Upper Carboniferous East European stages as the global 
stages. This artificially solved the problem of naming Westphalian or Cantabrian/Stephanian 
to sequences in Western Europe but did not facilitate the correlation of the several basins, 
especially when these are strictly terrestrial. The middle upper part of the Pennsylvanian sub-
system (Stephanian = uppermost Moscovian, Kasimovian and Gzhelian) is currently under 
revision (Clayton et al., 2008). In recent years, two important lines of work have shed some 
light on the palynostratigraphical division of the Moscovian-Kasimovian in Europe. Mclean et 
al. (2005) produced a very detailed zonation of the North Sea Carboniferous strata from the 
uppermost Tournaisian up to Westphalian D based on first and last occurrences of miospore 
species. For the Westphalian the scheme has been applied to some extent in offshore and 
onshore areas in The Netherlands, northern Germany and northern France (Mclean et al., 
2005). Ties with marine biota were made in several points but none in the Westphalian D. In 
parallel, several papers by Dimitrova and Cleal (Cleal et al., 2003; Dimitrova &amp;amp; Cleal 2008, 
2007; Dimitrova et al., 2005; Dimitrova, 2004a, b) studied the Westphalian-Stephanian 
microfloral succession of terrestrial basins in Bulgaria and the UK and revised some of the 
published data from other basins across Europe and North America. The ties with the 
macrofloral record were made for most of the studied areas. Although these studies did not 
refine the existing zonation schemes, they provided valuable information on ranges of several 
taxa that can be used to correlate different basins. Unfortunately there are some apparent 
discrepancies in the ranges and boundary defining taxa between the available biozonation 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

212

schemes. For example, the range bases of Lundbladispora gigantea (Alpern) Doubinger, 1968 
and Schopfites dimorphus Kosanke, 1950 is at the base of biozone W7b (Westphalian D see 
Fig.5.6) according to Mclean et al. (2005), but is said to be marking the base of the Stephanian 
by Dimitrova &amp;amp; Cleal (2008). L. gigantea (Alpern) Doubinger, 1968 is represented in Clayton 
et al. (1977) range chart as having its range base in upper SL biozone (Westphalian C). 
Additionally Mclean et al. (2005) also considers the range top of Westphalensisporites 
irregularis Alpern, 1959 to be near the base of biozone W7b while it is reported in several 
basins in Europe to extend well into the Stephanian (lower N.BM zone) (Clayton et al., 1977). 
A similar situation occurs with Florinites junior Potonié &amp;amp; Kremp, 1954. 

For the Santa Susana basin assemblages, one may ask what scheme is more 
appropriate. The work by Cleal (2008a, b) suggests that macrofloral associations of 
Pennsylvanian Portuguese basins, including the SSB, are closely associated with the Silesian 
and Rhine palaeoprovinces which includes the assemblages from NW Spain, Upper Silesia, 
NW Germany, Dobrudzha Coalfield (Bulgaria), N Turkey, Pennines (Silesian) and SW Britain 
and Canadian Maritimes (Rhine). During the Cantabrian Portuguese and NW Spanish 
assemblages develop some degree of provincialism, but remain closely related with Silesian 
and Rhine palaeoprovinces (Cleal, 2008a, b). Thus it seems appropriate to use the scheme 
proposed by Clayton et al., (1977) with the refinements proposed by Cleal et al., (2003) and 
Dimitrova &amp;amp; Cleal (2008). The use of the scheme by Mclean et al., (2005) may not be readily 
applicable as it may reflect a floral succession of a different palaeoprovince, it does not cover 
the Stephanian and the fact that it is based on marine sequences may introduce other variables 
that limit its application to a terrestrial basin such as the SSB. 

Fernandes (1998, 2001) attributed the SSB assemblage studied by him to the OT or ST 
Miospore Biozones. He found (?)Angulisporites splendidus Bharadwaj 1954, Latensina trileta 
Alpern 1958 (index taxa for the ST Miospore Biozone), Cheidelonites sp. and Candidispora 
candida Venkatachala, 1963, indicative of the ST Miospore Biozone. In his analysis of the 
assemblage the positioning of the Westphalian/Stephanian boundary in terms of microflora is 
discussed and it is suggested that the assemblage might in fact belong to the ST Miospore 
Biozone.  

VFigueira 1 to 5 sections 
Several samples were collected from grey shales and silts of the sequence underlying 

the fossiliferous levels (Fig. 5.4). From the 4 samples processed by standard palynological 
methods, 3 provided observable palynomorphs from which several slides were produced. The 
forth sample collected within the top fossiliferous levels provided only dark brown and black 
phytoclasts. Samples were observed mainly from unoxidized residues, but low concentrated 
bleach was used to clear darker sporomorphs (mainly thick-walled ones). 

The organic residues from the 3 productive samples were dominated by light to dark 
brown phytoclasts with subordinate amounts of sporomorphs. Rare algal remains were found 
in all samples. Within the sporomorphs, large (&gt;80?m), thin walled, laevigate and finely 
sculptured trilete and monolete forms were clearly dominant (ca. 45%) Most of these forms 
are assignable to genera Schopfipollenites (ca. 30%), Wilsonites and Florinites. Other 
numerically important sporomorphs within the assemblages are Cingulicavati and Crassiti 
infraturmae spores, namely the genera Densosporites, Lycospora and Crassispora (all around 
7-8%). Considering the parent plants described for these taxa (e.g. Balme, 1995; Bek &amp;amp; 
Oplustil, 1998; Traverse, 2007 and references there in), it seems plausible that the surrounding 
palaeobotanical assemblage was dominated by Medullosaceae, Cycadofilicales and 
Cordaitales forms along with lycopsid trees. Qualitatively this is in accordance with the 



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

213

palaeobotanical finds in the same section, although lycopsids are more abundant than any 
other group (see palaeobotanical section for discussion). 

Sporomorph wall colour was yellow in thin walled forms (e.g. Schopfipollenites spp.) 
and medium brown in thick walled taxa (e.g. Crassispora spp.). Preservation of sporomorphs 
is moderate to good, but nearly all specimens had some corrosion features such as pitting of 
the wall surface, enhancement/modification of simple ornamentation (laevigate, granulate, 
verrucate, punctuate, etc.) or partial destruction of thin exine layers (mostly the exoexine) 
which often made difficult the recognition of trilete and monolete marks. Over 80 spore and 
pollen taxa were identified, although a significant number of these are left in open 
nomenclature due to the moderate preservation. The basal sample (VFIG 1.1) provided only a 
few determinable specimens while samples VFIG 3.2 and VFIG 4.2 provided over 300 grains 
per slide. 

The VFigueira 1 to 5 section assemblages contain Cadiospora magna Kosanke, 1950 
which appears in the upper OT miospore biozone and extends into the Stephanian. Significant 
numbers of the ST miospore biozone index species Latensina trileta Alpern 1958 are found 
and many other specimens appear to be L. trileta, but the poor preservation limits specific 
determination. The presence of Latensina trileta Alpern 1958 is recorded rarely from the 
Torispora securis–Torispora laevigata (SL) Miospore Biozone onwards (Clayton et al., 1977; 
Pittau et al., 2008), but it only becomes frequent or common in the ST zone. Angulisporites 
splendidus Bharadwaj 1954 was not found. Auxiliary taxa such as Cheidelonites sp. is 
represented by a several specimens. Lundbladispora gigantea (Alpern) Doubinger, 1968 is 
present and could indicate a Stephanian age, but is reported from the North Sea from the mid 
Westphalian D (see discussion above).  The presence of cf. Reticulatisporites reticulatus
Ibrahim, 1933, is problematic as the reported range top is in the middle-upper part of the OT 
miospore biozone. In general terms the assemblage is more characteristic of the Stephanian, 
considering the abundance of pollen grains and the presence of typical spore taxa of this age. 

There is an apparent discrepancy with the biostratigraphical results derived from the 
palaeobotanical data (Wagner &amp;amp; Sousa, 1983) which point to an older age: Neuropteris ovata 
zones or Dicksonites plueckeneti sub zone – corresponding to upper OT Miospore Biozone of 
Clayton et al., 1977; 2003 (Moscovian age). All of the fossil plant taxa described from the 
locality have biostratigraphical ranges that reach the Cantabrian (uppermost OT – lowermost 
ST biozones). Wagner and Sousa, 1983 could not exclude the possibility that the fossil plant 
assemblage was in fact Cantabrian in age.  

It thus seems plausible to conclude that the VFigueira 1 to 5 section is truly Stephanian 
in age (see Fig. 5.6). 

The assemblage described by Fernandes (1998, 2001) from borehole cuttings may 
indeed belong to the ST Miospore Biozone. His results are coherent with ours.  

Revision of the macroflora is underway and the preliminary results (Mattioli et al., 
2009) show the existence of previously undescribed taxa from the site which may lead to a 
reassessment of its age. The publication of a revised Western Europe Upper Pennsylvanian 
Miospore Biozonation scheme (especially for the Stephanian) will certainly facilitate a more 
definitive biostratigraphical conclusion.  

Susana 5 and 6 sections 
 As mentioned above the samples from Susana 5 and 6 sections provided few 
recognizable palynomorphs. Although considerably impoverished and thus difficult to 
interpret, it is interesting to note that pollen grains are almost absent (few specimens of 
Florinites sp. and Schopfipollenites sp. are present). Verrucosisporites spp. and

Laevigatosporites spp. are dominant in both sections. The presence of Vestispora cf. costata 
(Balme, 1952) Spode in Smith &amp;amp; Buterworth 1967; Raistrickia fulva Artuz, 1957 and 
Convolutispora sp. could indicate that the assemblage is significantly older than the ST zone 
proposed for the VFigueira 1 to 5 assemblages (see Fig. 5.6). Other recorded taxa such as 
Crassispora cf. maculosa, Raistrickia cf. corynoges, Verrucosisporites cf. cerosus, Trinidulus 
diamphidios Felix &amp;amp; Paden, 1964 and Microreticulatisporites microreticulatus Knox, 1950 
have range tops in lower Westphalian or even the Mississippian. Due to the reduced number of 
specimens and moderate to poor preservation it is uncertain if these are reworked from older 
rocks or autochtonous palynomorphs. Several reworked palynomorphs were observed, mainly 
acritarchs (e.g. Veryhachyum sp., Gorgonisphaeridium sp.) but these clearly have a different 
degree of maturation and stand out in the slides (see Pl. 5.7). These reworked acritarchs very 
likely originate from the surrounding Toca da Moura complex metasedimentary rocks (OMZ) 
or the SPZ Grupo do Lobo units (Santa Iria and Horta da Torre Fms.). Westphalensisporites 
cf. irregularis and Triquitrites cf. sculptilis are also present limiting the age of the assemblage 
to the Westphalian B.  
 The assemblages from the Susana 5 and 6 are considered to be, possibly, of 
Westphalian C or D age, but further investigation of the basin’s palynology is needed to assess 
the true temporal extent of the sedimentation.

5.3.7 Thermal and burial history 
The results obtained from the vitrinite reflectance measurements are summarized in 

Table 5.5. All the maceral particles from the SSB are altered, probably due to outcrop 
weathering, causing a decrease in the Rr% values. Sample VFIG 6.1 did not provide unaltered 
particles and the measured Rr% (1,1%) can be used is as a reference for the values expected 
for weathered samples. Significantly higher values such as the ones measured in VFIG 3.2 are 
associated with semifusinite particles which are difficult to distinguish from vitrinite in 
palynological residues. The remaining values in Table 5.5 refer to unaltered vitrinite particles.

Table 5.5 – Random mean vitrinite reflectance values and corresponding palaeotemperatures of the SSB 

and Toca da Moura/Cabrela Complex. Palaeotemperatures obtained from equation in Barker (1988). Data   
from Paulo Fernandes (unpublished). 

Thus, the representative Rr% values for the SSB are around 1,55%, corresponding to a 
maximum temperature of ca. 193ºC using Barker’s equation (Barker, 1988). This is coherent 
with the values obtained by Sousa et al. (2009) in museum coal samples from the SSB.  

The samples from the Toca de Moura/Cabrela Complex have Rr% values between 3,02 and 
4,24%. Many of the outcrops of these complexes have igneous intrusions, which produce 
higher Rr% values. The representative Rr% value of these complexes, unaffected by igneous 
intrusion is probably between 3 and 3,8%Rr (260 – 290ºC). Despite its age (Tournaisian –

Viséan) these are significantly higher values than the ones obtained for the SSB that rests 
unconformably over the Toca da Moura Complex. 

The results show that the BSS and Toca da Moura/Cabrela complex had different 
thermal histories. The processes of subsidence, organic maturation and exhumation of the 
Toca da Moura/Cabrela complex occurred during a considerably short time interval, between 
the Upper Viséan and the Lower Kasimovian (possibly Moscovian). This is a maximum time 
span of 34Ma. The results also show that the thermal evolution of the SSB is post-Kasimovian 
and never reached the same magnitude of temperatures attained by the Toca da Moura/Cabrela 
complex. The maturation of this complex was not affected by its re-burial under the SSB. 

The stratigraphical and organic maturation data point to the synorogenic character of 
these basins and rapid subsidence with elevated geothermal gradients. The effect of igneous 
activity on the maturation of the SSB is unknown but cannot be excluded.  

5.4 Discussion and Conclusions 
The basin’s sedimentary facies and its evolution can only be generally considered due 

to the limited exposure and restricted knowledge of the basal unit. A fluvial system probably 
controlled sedimentation of the basin, although the basal unit was probably more dependant on 
the surrounding topography, possibly with a considerable alluvial component. During later 
stages of the basin evolution (corresponding to the upper unit), perennial lakes developed in 
some areas (e.g. VFigueira 6 section), but a fluvial meandering system and associated flood 
plain and/or abandoned channel deposits seems to have defined the sedimentation 
characteristics of most of the temporal and spatial extent of the basin. 

Considering the geometry of the basin, palaeocurrent and provenance data, it is evident 
that both SPZ and OMZ rocks were exposed, being eroded during the time sedimentation was 
occurring in the SSB. During the initial stages of the basin filling, the surrounding landscape 
was very likely dominated by the Grupo de Cuba felsic rocks as they make up the vast 
majority of the clasts of the basal conglomerate. The magmatic activity that originated them 
extended at least to the lower part of the basin’s sedimentation history. The main palaeocurrent 
directions probably reflect the sediment transport from the areas to the W and E to the central 
areas of the basin and along the strike, mainly to S. 

Several controls acted on the basin sedimentation. Large scale tectonic events and 
periods promoted the formation of a depocenter along the SSSZ and consequent onset of 
sedimentation. The same tectonic kinematics allowed the continuation of the sedimentation. A 
period of tectonic stasis (or milder activity) is probably associated with the shift from an 
essentially conglomeratic sedimentation (basal unit) to a stage dominated by finer grained 
material and the development of peat in some areas (upper unit). The cyclic characteristics of 
the sedimentation (at the meter scale) may be associated with small tectonic pulses, but may 
simply reflect autogenic processes of the fluvial system (Catuneanu, 2006). 

The post-Pennsylvanian evolution of the basin was controlled, at an early stage, by the 
same tectonic activity that originated the basin (late Variscan). During the Cainozoic (and 
Mesozoic?) the basin was exposed and eroded, especially the northern parts. The southern 
parts of the basin were covered during the Tertiary by a thin sequence (&lt;20m) of sediments. 
The original extent of the basin was probably much bigger and it was probably connected to 
the flysch sedimentation occurring to the S during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian (at 
least to the OT miospore biozone, Pereira et al. (2008), in the SPZ. The increased preservation 
potential of a basin along a structural-originated trench and the partial cover by Tertiary 
sediments allowed its perpetuation to the current day.

The plant fossil assemblage found at Vale de Figueira locality is probably a 
combination of transported plant remains from several areas of a river system (corresponding 
to different ecological settings), with a greater predominance of peat forming plants which 
seem to have been transported only for short distances (para-autochthonous assemblage?). The 
different lithologies found at the site indicate a river system with strong lateral and vertical 
variations (in time and space) which is in accordance with the observed mixing of plant 
remains from different areas of the system.  

Additional collecting will allow a detailed revision of the plant taxonomy. The 
interpretation the section in terms of coupled lithofacies – plant taxonomy analysis is also 
planed. The abundance, proportions and taphonomy of each group and the relation with the 
lithology in which it is found will hopefully allow to infer on the palaeoecology of different 
groups of plants and shed some light on the apparent discrepancies between palaeobotanical 
and palynological records. 
 The age of the basin can only be bracketed for a part of the upper unit. The VFigueira 1 
to 5 section provided a sporomorph assemblage assignable to the ST miospore biozone of 
Clayton et al., (1977) (Kasimovian = “Lower Stephanian”). Previous records from another 
locality (Fernandes, 1998, 2001) provided the same results. The assemblages from Susana 5 
and 6 suggest that significantly older sediments may be present, but the poor quality of the 
residues preclude further interpretations. 

5.5 Systematic Palynology  
For the systematic palynology the Turmal System proposed by Potonié (1970) with 

modifications by Traverse (2007) is followed. The frequency of each taxon is indicated as well 
as the section where it occurs. The statistical significance of the frequency of sporomorphs in 
VFigueira 1 to 5 section is high as several hundreds of specimens were counted. For the 
Susana 5 and 6 sections, the significance is much lower as the total number of specimens in 
each section is lower than 100 and thus the abundance categorization is not shown for these 
sections. The frequency ranges of Smith and Butterworth (1967) were applied and are 
summarized in the following table: 

Rare &amp;lt;0,5% 
Frequent  0,5-2% 
Common  2,1-5%

Abstract
 Several late Early Devonian and Middle Devonian limestone occurrences in 
Western Ossa-Morena are described here (Odivelas Limestone). These occur within the 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

251

oldest volcanic rocks of the Beja Igneous Complex (BIC) and along important shear zones 
within and bordering the Ossa-Morena Zone.

One of these occurrences (Covas Ruivas locality) was studied in terms of reef 
fauna, conodont biostratigraphy, macro- and micro-facies and magnetic susceptibility 
stratigraphy. The results point to a bracketing between the Po. patulus and T. australis
conodont biozones (uppermost Emsian – middle-late Eifelian). The field data, facies 
analysis and reef fauna indicate that the sequence is composed entirely of calciturbidite 
and debris-flow deposits (intercalated with hemipelagic tuffites) related to a (up-slope) 
reefal system resting on top of volcanic buildings within a large volcanic complex. The 
purity of the limestones does not seem to be generally influenced by volcanic 
contributions. Although with some uncertainties, the first part of the section seems to 
show pre-, syn- and post-Basal Chote  Event (BCE) beds as recorded by significant shifts 
in lithofacies and magnetic susceptibility signal. A tentative interregional correlation is 
suggested with sections in Morocco, Nevada (USA), Czech Republic and Uzbekistan.  
 The Cortes locality, also in the Odivelas reservoir area, although deformed and 
metamorphosed provided an abundant fossil recored which allows their positioning as late 
Eifelian/early Givetian in age and to relate the reef fauna with the typical Rhenish facies 
for the same time period. Magnetic susceptibility analysis was attempted and is in 
agreement with the biostratigraphy, but the limited extent of sections and the 
metamorphism precludes firm correlations. The field evidence, petrographic and 
geochemical analysis point to a close palaeogeographical relation and dependence of the 
reef system on volcanic structures which are included in the Beja Igneous Complex 
 Several limestone occurrences are known from the Toca da Moura complex 
(TMC), which are probably correlatable with the Odivelas Limestone but their 
stratigraphic and structural relation with the surrounding pelitic and volcanic rocks of this 
complex is not known in detail. The finding of crinoidal fragments in samples from two of 
these limestone bodies is reported. These suggest a Mid Devonian sedimentation age, 
although some taxonomic and biostratigraphic uncertainties remain. The previously 
reported Early Carboniferous age of the pelitic sediments of the TMC is confirmed by 
palynology from one of the sites.  
Key words: Ossa-Morena Zone, Beja Igneous Complex, Odivelas limestone, Emsian-
Eifelian-Givetian, Magnetic susceptibility Stratigraphy, reef fauna, conodonts, crinoids. 

6.1 Introduction 
The Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ) is a major geotectonic unit located in the southern 

sector of the Iberian Massif (Lötze, 1945; Julivert &amp;amp; Martínez,1983, see Fig.6.1), forming, 
together with the Central-Iberian Zone, the Iberian Autochthon (IA) of the so-called 
Iberian Massif (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 1990). The Iberian Massif, located in the western half of 
Iberian Peninsula, represents the largest and one of the most complete and continuous 
exposures of Variscan Belt in Western Europe. The OMZ involves a complex tectonic 
scenario with a development and closure of an ophiolitic complex – the so-called Beja-
Acebuches Ophiolitic Complex (BAOC, Fonseca &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Fonseca et al., 1999; 
Figueiras et al. 2002; Mateus et al., 1999). Moreover, the OMZ southern border comprises 
highly deformed exotic terranes of oceanic nature (including the “Pulo do Lobo” 
Accretionary Terrane (PLAT) and the BAOC), as complex tectonic melanges (Almeida et 
al., 2001; Araújo et al., 2005; Booth-Rea et al., 2006).  These formations are rimming an 
early main Variscan suture in southwest of Iberian Massif and they accreted to the Iberian

Autochthon before the Middle/Upper Devonian times (Fonseca &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1993; Fonseca 
et al., 1999).

The BAOC separates the OMZ and the South-Portuguese Zone (SPZ), which is 
regarded as another exotic terrain, originated from a so-called “Southern Palaeo-
continent” and accreted to the IA during Carboniferous times (Dallmeyer et  al., 1993). 

It has been proposed (Crespo-Blanc &amp;amp; Orozco, 1988; Crespo-Blanc, 2007; 
Fonseca, 1995, 1997; Fonseca et al., 1999) that a major ocean (Rheic Ocean) was closed 
by subduction/obduction leaving some remainder ophiolitic slices: the Lizard suture in 
SW England and the Beja-Acebuches suture zone, represent, respectively, the northern 
and southern branches of the same ocean (Fonseca et al., 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2007). 
Data acquired during different research projects clearly shows new dismembered 
ophiolitic slices into the OMZ (Internal Ossa-Morena Zone Ophiolitic Sequences – 
IOMZOS, Fonseca et al, 1999), which corresponds to allochthonous klippen resting on top 
of the lower Palaeozoic sequences (Ribeiro et al., 2007). 

6.1.2 Upper Palaeozoic sedimentation in Ossa-Morena Zone 
During the Lower Devonian, as well as for most of the Lower Palaeozoic (except 

for the Cambrian), the sedimentation in the OMZ was generally occurring in a passive 
margin setting (Quesada, 1990; Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 2004). These rocks 
occur in wide areas from Portalegre to Cordoba (Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 
2004) and more to the South in the Barrancos-Estremoz area (Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-
Marco, 1990, 2004; Oliveira et al., 1991; Piçarra, 2000), Terena syncline (Piçarra, 2000) 
and Valle synclines, Venta de Ciervo and Cerron del Hornillo in Spain (Robardet &amp;amp; 
Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 2004). Fine siliciclastics dominate the sequences but some 
calcareous levels occur (Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 2004) characterising 
proximal deposits to deep fan turbidites (Oliveira et al., 1991; Piçarra, 2000; Borrego et 
al., 2005).

Lower Devonian sediments are known from several sectors of the Ossa-Morena 
Zone (OMZ), namely the Estremoz-Barrancos area (Montemor-Ficalho Unit) where 
several Formations (Terena, Xistos Raiados and Russianas Fms) have been dated by 
spores (Pereira et al., 1998, 1999), graptolites (Piçarra, 1997, 1998, 2000) and trilobites 
(Perdigão, 1973; Perdigão et al., 1982). The whole sequence is siliciclastic and the 
lithological variations probably reflect a palaeogeographical change from proximal 
deposits to deep fan turbidites (Oliveira et al., 1991; Piçarra, 2000; Borrego et al., 2005).  
The youngest sediments described from this area are from the Terena Fm. which reach the 
DE miospore biozone of Richardson &amp;amp; McGregor, 1986 (Upper Emsian-lowermost 
Eifelian) (Pereira et al., 1999). Several fossiliferous limestone occurrences in this area 
have been reported by Piçarra &amp;amp; Le Menn (1994), Piçarra et al. (1999), Sarmiento et al. 
(2000) and Piçarra &amp;amp; Sarmiento (2006). The age is still uncertain due to the considerable 
deformation and metamorphic grade, but in view of the crinoidal remains and rare 
conodonts extracted from the limestones the authors suggested an Upper Silurian to 
Devonian age, questioning the true age of the Estremoz Marbles, so far considered as 
being Cambrian (Sarmiento et al., 2000; Piçarra &amp;amp; Sarmiento,2006). 

Further East, in the Zafra-Córdoba-Alanís sector of the OMZ, the Valle and Cerrón 
del Hornillo synclines comprise fossiliferous Silurian-Lower Devonian siliciclastic 
sequences (Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 2004 and references therein).

Emsian reefal sedimentation in the OMZ was described by May (1999) and 
Rodríguez et al. (2007). It should also be mentioned the occurrence of several Lower 
Devonian carbonate sediments in the Obejo-Valsequillo-Puebla de la Reina Domain of the 
Central Iberian Zone (CIZ) (Liao et al., 2001; May, 2006). Also in the CIZ, near

254

Portalegre, Perdigão (1967, 1974) described a long succession and several fossiliferous 
sites of Late Silurian to “Couvinian” age. The sequence is mostly siliciclastic, grading to 
impure limestones in the upper part of the “Geddinian”. Folding and faulting of the 
sections limited firm conclusions concerning the age of the sediments. Both studies were 
based on brachiopods which were regarded as being of an “Ardenne type” of fauna 
(Perdigão 1967, 1974). The same affinity was considered for the contemporaneous faunas 
described from Barrancos (Ossa-Morena Zone) (Perdigão, 1973). The 
palaeobiogeographical relation of the CIZ sediments with the contemporaneous 
occurrences in OMZ was suggested to be significantly different by Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-
Marco (2004). These authors refer a more “Rhenish” affinity of the CIZ contrasting with 
the more “Bohemian” affinity of the OMZ. 

The Middle Devonian is generally absent in the OMZ. This has been interpreted as 
a consequence of the first pulses of the Hercynian orogeny and generalized uplift of this 
area during the Middle Devonian (Robardet &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1990, 2004; Oliveira et 
al. 1991). In the Évora-Beja Domain, the Pedreira de Engenharia calciturbidite outcrops 
(near Montemor-o-Novo) provided Eifelian conodonts (van den Boogaard, 1973), but the 
relation of these with the surrounding siliciclastic sediments remains unclear (van den 
Boogaard, 1973; Pereira et al., 2006). The overlying limestone lenses interbedded with 
shales of the Cabrela Complex dated as Frasnian (van den Boogaard, 1983) have been 
shown to be olistoliths in Viséan shales (Pereira &amp;amp; Oliveira, 2003, Pereira et al., 2006). In 
the same sector and within the BIC, the only known Middle Devonian sediments are the 
Odivelas limestones (Conde &amp;amp; Andrade, 1974) which are the subject of the present work. 
Other rare occurrences of limestones in the same domain are reported in the contact area 
with the South Portuguese Zone near the Caeirinha mine, Pena, Atalaia, Monte das Cortes 
and Alfundão (Pereira et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006), but the age of these lenses is 
unknown and the relation with the surrounding Carboniferous Toca da Moura volcano-
sedimentary complex remains obscure.  

The Upper Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentation is controlled by the pulses 
and geometry of the oblique collision occurring between the SPZ and the OMZ in a clear 
synorogenic phase (Quesada et al., 1990). According to the same authors these sediments 
can be divided in foreland basin flysches and molasses (mostly Upper Devonian and 
Lower Carboniferous), synorogenic intermontane terrestrial deposits (Upper 
Carboniferous) and late orogenic intermontane deposits (uppermost Carboniferous and 
Permian), all of which have a greater development to the eastern areas of the OMZ. Close 
to the studied area (western OMZ) the Cabrela and Toca-da-Moura complexes are the 
representatives of the Lower Carboniferous foreland basin deposits (Pereira et al., 2006) 
and the Santa Susana coal basin of the intermontane Pennsylvanian deposits (Wagner &amp;amp; 
Sousa, 1983; Sousa &amp;amp; Wagner, 1983; Wagner, 1983; Chapter 5 of this work) 

Other Devonian and Carboniferous sediments (mostly black shales) are present in 
the northern parts of the OMZ along the Porto-Tomar shear zone but their deposition 
seems to be controlled by a quite different geodynamic setting (e.g. Chaminé et al., 2003; 
Fernandes et al., 2001; Fernández et al., 2003; Vázquez et al., 2007) and are dealt with 
elsewhere in this work.  

6.1.3 The Basal Chote  Event 
The Basal Chote  Event (BCE) is regarded as a global bioevent which corresponds 

to a transgressive pulse within a series of moderate to strongly manifested fluctuations of

sea level closely above the Emsian-Eifelian boundary. In carbonate slope conditions, these 
environmental changes are often (but not always) manifested by the presence of 
“blackish” suboxic sediments and reduced carbonate accumulation rate, typically with an 
overlying series of rapidly accumulated coarse litho- and bioclastic calciturbidites (e.g. 
Berkyová et al., 2008; Chlupá  &amp;amp; Kukal, 1986). 

This event was originally defined in the Barrandian area (Chlupá  &amp;amp; Kukal, 1986) 
and has been reported from many other basins world wide (Berkyová et al., 2008) e.g. in 
Southern Europe, North Africa, North America (Appalachians), South America and Asia 
(Siberian Platform, Ural Mountains). In MS-GRS records (Koptíková et al. 2007), the 
BCE usually corresponds to a zone with low amplitude MS records, whereas the 
immediately overlying intervals show broadly oscillatory patterns, and the BCE level is 
typically followed by the shift of Th/U ratio and uranium concentration peak (burial of 
organic matter, hiatuses). The glacigenic origin of a sea level fall and subsequent sea level 
rise around and after the BCE, respectively, was proposed according to oxygen isotope 
trends (Elrick et al., 2009).

6.2 Covas Ruivas Locality 

6.2.1 Local Geological setting and previous work 
The Covas Ruivas group of outcrops is located in the southernmost sector of the 

Ossa-Morena Zone, specifically in the Évora- Beja Domain (Fig.6.1A). These limestones 
are capped by volcanic rocks belonging in Beja Igneous Complex – Sta. Susana-Odivelas 
Subsector (Oliveira et al., 1991).  Volcanic rocks have a porphyritic texture, with 
plagioclase phenocrysts, and more rarely, clinopyroxenes changed and transformed to 
epidote, still with some chlorite and calcite (Santos et al., 1990). A typical mineral 
paragenesis of low-grade metamorphism (green schists facies), with chlorite + actinolite + 
epidote (in occurrence order) is observed. 

Andrade et al. (1976) grouped these volcanic rocks in the Peroguarda Complex, 
and named them Rebolado Basalts. This author described the rocks as (meta)basalts that 
range from pyroclastic to effusive rocks. Santos et al. (1990), states that the Rebolado 
Basalts (referred as OD-6 unit) consist of basic to intermediate volcanites.  

The limestones are bounded by two major faults that connect the volcanic rocks 
with the limestones, although the eastern fault is interpreted. Internally the limestone body 
presents folding (Fig.6.1B), which is attributed to regional variscan deformation (episodes 
D2b and D3) and so there is some uncertainty on the existence of small repetitions and/or 
gaps in the section. The folding assigned to D2b shows vergency to the NW with axial 
planes with general direction NNE-SSW dipping 70º to the SE and the fold axis dipping to 
the NE. Folds are open (opening angle of around 80º), cylindrical and asymmetrical with 
short limb to tilt about 70 to the N-NW and along limb about 45 to the NE-E. 

In turn, the folding assigned to D3 presents vergency to the SW with axial planes 
nearly vertical, dipping to the NE, with axes plunging 40° to the NW quadrant. Folds are 
cylindrical, open and usually symmetrical. The flanks tilt between 40º and 60º to the NE 
and NW. 

The name of the locality – Covas Ruivas – derives from the name given to a local 
farm house referred in topographic maps of the 1950’s and 1960’s used in Andrade et al.
(1976) and Andrade (1983). Unfortunately the name was not used in more recent 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

256

topographic coverage of the area. The original name is kept to avoid contradicting 
referencing of the site.

The site is composed by two groups of outcrops (Fig.6.1B). The westernmost 
(Covas Ruivas I) is restricted to a few, small and badly preserved, natural outcrops and 
abundant floats. The second group, to the East, (Covas Ruivas II) is composed of 
extensive and continuous natural outcrops and a several small abandoned quarries. Most 
of our study is dedicated to this second group of outcrops. Both groups of outcrops are 
over- and underlain by fine tuffites that grade to coarser pyroclastic “true volcanic” 
deposits and basaltic lava flows. Tertiary deposits cover discordantly the whole area so 
that outcrops of older rocks are restricted to valleys and low land zones.

6.2.2 Materials and Methods 
The Covas Ruivas II site was logged and the limestone beds sampled for magnetic 

susceptibility and conodont analyses. Lithology, fossil content and relevant sedimentary 
structures are described. Additional samples of the limestones and interbedded tuffites 
were taken for thin-sectioning, palynology processing and XRD analyses.  

6.2.2.1 Conodonts 
33 limestone samples weighting between 1,5kg and 4kg were collected in regular 

intervals. Limestones composed of sand-sized particles were preferably chosen, which 
normally corresponded to the base of beds. Each sample was washed with running water 
and brush and crushed to pieces of about 4cm in diameter. Dissolution was done using 
10% acetic acid in ca. 20L plastic buckets in laboratories in Aveiro University and in 
Prague (Institute of Geology, Academy of Sciences). The acid was replaced when reaction 
halted and the&amp;lt;1mm undissolved residue separated. The residue was further sieved to 
discard the&amp;lt;125µm fraction. After drying, the residue was observed under a binocular 
microscope and conodont elements picked into a cell. The dissolution of some samples 
resulted in a large amount of residue. In these cases heavy liquid and magnetic separation 
were performed. Selected conodont elements were observed and photographed by SEM 
CAMECA SX 100 at the Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech 
Republic (see Pl. 6.3). 

6.2.2.2 Reef fauna 
One thick limestone bed between 58 and 61,5m (Fig. 6.2; Pl. 6.2) was particularly 

rich in macroscopic (up to a few centimetres) bioclasts of corals, stromatoporoids and 
crinoids. Weathered surfaces revealing fossils were photographed and floats deriving from 
this bed were sampled for thin section analysis. 

6.2.2.3 Thin sections, XRD and palynology analysis 
Conodont samples were thin-sectioned for semi-quantitative petrographic 

description. Additional samples closely below and above the Emsian-Eifelian boundary 
were thin-sectioned and described. Besides standard petrographic characterization, the 
proportions of selected components were quantified. Counting of particles (&gt; 100 µm) 
along successive, randomly chosen, lines on thin sections was performed. Particles were 
grouped according to their origin: reef and platform derived (crinoid skeletal remains, 
bryozoa, corals, stromatoporoids, etc.); pelagic origin (tentaculites and radiolarians);

peloids; intraclasts; volcanic grains; other non-carbonate grains (micas, quartz, feldspars, 
etc.) and pyrite and oxides (mostly diagenetic). These groups were assembled in bar charts 
and plotted on Fig. 6.2. This method overestimates the purity of limestones as it does not 
consider smaller non-carbonate particles. Roughly the same samples were processed for 
determination of total organic and inorganic carbon concentrations in rocks (TOC, TIC) in 
the Infra-Red Laboratory of the Institute of Geology SAS, Banská Bystrica, Slovakia. The 
results are plotted in Fig. 6.2.

Tuffite and limestone samples were crushed and sieved to obtain the smaller than 
63 µm fraction. A small amount was placed over a glass slide and homogenized by mixing 
with distilled water and was left to dry. The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded with a 
copper anode X-ray tube (Cu-K  radiation) using a Philips PW1710, powder 
diffractometer and X´Pert software PC-APD 3.6 at the Tropical Research Institute (IICT) 
Department of Natural Sciences(DCN) / Global Development (DES) in Lisbon. Six 
samples of dark grey tuffites were also processed for palynology using standard HCl + HF 
attacks. 

6.2.2.4 Magnetic susceptibility 
The top of each calciturbidite bed was preferably sampled avoiding the overlying 

tuffite bed. Each calciturbidite bed was considered to be a single turbidity event and thus 
quasi-instantaneous. Several beds were sampled at different levels and the resulting MS 
values varied very little (&amp;lt;2.10-9 [m3.kg-1]) within a single bed, even for thicker (&gt; 2 m) 
beds. This method resulted in a sampling spacing dependant on the thicknesses of each 
limestone bed and tuffite interbed. In practice the spacing varies between 10 cm and ca. 50 
cm. At the base and top of the sequence, tuffites are dominant over the limestones (mostly 
lenses) and the spacing between two samples can reach several meters (Fig. 6.2). All 
samples were measured using a Kappabridge KLY-2 (Agico s.r.o.) at the Rock Magnetism 
Laboratory of the Instituto D. Luiz (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon).

6.2.3 Results 

6.2.3.1 Litho- and bio-facies and TOC 
The Covas Ruivas II site has a long exposure of mildly deformed volcanic rocks, 

mostly coarse pyroclastic deposits and subordinate basaltic lava flows (Pl. 6.1B). Rare 
black chert beds up to ca. 2 m thick occur within the finer pyroclastic material. The 
sequence fines up to silt-sized, very finely laminated tuffs/tuffites where the first 
limestone beds appear. The term tuffite is used here in a broad sense. It refers to the rocks 
usually forming thin laminated beds, which have, invariably, a large proportion of 
volcanic-derived material (Pl. 6.1C; Pl. 6.1E). These seem to be, in most instances, 
hemipelagites. 

All limestone beds have visible recrystalization, observed both macroscopically 
and in thin sections (the detail of some grains is frequently obliterated). The bio- and litho-
facies are described and categorized as observed macroscopically and in thin sections. 
Facies codes are ca1, ca2, … for limestones and t1, t2, … for tuffites. The data are 
summarized in Table 1.

Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

The first 5m of sequence (Section part A) are within the patulus Zone and are 
characterized by continuous beds of wackestones and grainstones with very abundant 
crinoidal fragments (lithofacies ca1). These are interbedded with finely laminated tuffites 
which are dominant over the limestones (lithofacies t1). The following 42m (5 to 47m) 
correspond to the patulus and partitus Zones. The limestone beds become generally 
thinner, laterally discontinuous and rarer (lithofacies ca2) (Pl. 6.1D). Between 20 and 
27m, there are thicker, laterally continuous limestone beds, but these have the same 
characteristics as the limestone lenses just above and below. In the same interval and up to 
31m, there are several limestone beds and lenses with convolute bedding. One of these 
beds has abundant friable green shally clasts up to 2 cm in diameter. XRD analysis of 
these clasts show a composition dominated by calcite, but with relevant amounts of 
feldspars (ca. 15%), quartz (ca. 5%), clay minerals (illite, chlorite and smectite) and small 
amounts of Fe oxides. These clasts are interpreted as weathered tuffs/tuffites resting on the 
marine floor that were eroded during a particularly energetic turbidity event. 

Between 25 and 47 m the interbeded tuffites become dominant over the limestones. 
The tuffites become progressively darker with dark grey and black chert and cherty 
laminae (and radiolarians) increasing in proportion (lithofacies t2). The large gaps 
between 35 and 47 m correspond to a part of the section covered by rubble derived solely 
from dark grey and black cherty tuffites with rare outcrops. This part of the section is very 
probably a continuous sequence of cherty tuffites (lithofacies t2) which erode and 
disaggregate more easily than limestone beds.  
 Above these initial 47 m and up to 81 m, in the basal costatus Zone, the tuffites 
become suddenly subordinate in relation to the limestones and the section becomes 
carbonate rich (up to 80%) with few cherty mm lenses (lithofacies t3). 

Between 47 and 57 m limestone beds characteristically have a coarser massive 
base and fine up to a finely laminated top with silt sized grains (Pl. 6.1I). Synsedimentary 
deformation features such as small scale slumping and more commonly convolute bedding 
are observable occasionally throughout this part of the sequence (lower costatus Zone) (Pl. 
6.1H). Most of beds have a significant amount of peloids (up to 40%) (lithofacies ca3).

Above 57 m and to the top of part A of the section (80 m) all limestone beds can be 
classified as belonging to facies ca1, with a variable but generally decreasing proportion of 
peloids and pelagic grains (Pl. 6.1F). Within this interval the thick coarse breccia bed (57 
to 61,5 m) allows a closer description of the bio- and lithoclastic material and its 
characteristics. The debris is highly polydisperse and contains fragments from millimetre 
size up to several centimetres size. Variable alterations are indicative of an extensive 
mixing of the material delivered with the 'coral breccia'. Fresh or slightly reworked 
crinoidal debris are relatively common, from about 5 to 40 vol. % of the rock, and 
crinoidal pluricolumnals are also present. Brachiopods, bryozoans, ostracods, 
foraminifers, algae and other shell/skeleton forming organisms are also observed, but they 
never represent the dominant rock components. The coarsest 'breccia' types have the 
lowest contents of crinoids, and amount of sediment matrix is reduced in general, so that 
the large clasts have mostly stylolitic, pressure solution contacts. Intraclasts are also 
highly diversified. The spectrum of their compositions encompasses the rock types from 
partly cemented grainstones of platform and upper slope environments to compacted 
calcisiltites and muds of slope (e.g. Pl. 6.2D), as marked by sponge spiculae, styliolinid 
and rare cephalopod shells. The intraclasts of lithified limestones contain a variety of 
rocks types, which are ranging from coarse and well-washed grainstones to medium- to 
fine grained, well-sorted grainstones containing unaltered bioclasts together with

micritized chips and peloids, both in roughly equal amounts. Besides the grainstones and 
packstones of reef and upper slope environments, the basal parts of the channelized 
breccia flow sediments and coarse calciturbidites also contain blackish intraclasts of 
hemipelagic calcimudstones (rarely wackestones-packstones), which have angular to 
subrounded shapes and cm sizes. These were presumably reworked from older parts of the 
sequence (patulus and partitus zones?), and may originate from deeply dissected slopes 
(similarly as in the case of the younger Ka ák Event and its post-event breccia flows (e.g. 
Hladil, 1993). 

The coral and stromatoporoid skeletons are fragmentary, broken into mm to cm 
(max. dm) sized parts; complete coral colonies are almost absent.  Some skeletons have a 
fresh appearance and were filled by cements after their breccia- or turbulent flow 
redeposition into a deeper water environments, but many of them do not. In the latter, the 
silicification/desilicification and dolomitization/dedolomitization spots together with 
micritized rims and bands are commonly observed, and these altered spots in skeletons 
(partly also in early cements) were cut by abraded/crushed surfaces. Further, these 
surfaces were often micritized or coated by cryptalgal structures, and sometimes 
repeatedly. The intensity of this early change varies depending upon time of exposure and 
burial in the original sediment, differently on specimens or sides of the clasts. This type of 
alteration resembles the shoals with coral gravel on repeatedly abraded islands in Eastern 
Moravia (Hladil et al., 1994; Bosák et al., 2002).

Parts B and C of the sequence (within the costatus Zone) (Pl. 6.1K) are generally 
monotonous in terms of facies, bioclast content, thicknesses, proportion of 
tuffites/limestones, etc. and very similar to the upper 24 m (57 to 81 m) of part A of the 
sequence (lower costatus Zone) and can be generally included in the limestone facies ca1 
(more rarely ca3) and tuffite facies t3 (Pl. 6.1G, Pl. 6.1H).
 The top of the sequence (part C), starting near the base of the australis Zone (Pl. 
6.1K), is marked by an increase of the thickness and relative abundance of the tuffite beds. 
Limestone beds become rarer and laterally discontinuous, but are still 
grainstones/wackstones with abundant crinoid fragments – limestone facies ca1 and more 
rarely ca3. The composition of the tuffites becomes more siliceous, with quartz 
dominating (up to 90%) and very small amounts of calcite, feldspars and micas. Organic 
matter is present in minor amounts and its composition and maturity remains the same as 
for the rest of the sequence – tuffite facies t1. 
 Results from TIC/TOC analysis show an inverse proportional relation between 
organic and inorganic carbon content for all the analyzed samples. The higher TOC values 
are associated with lithofacies ca2, coherent with the darker colour and higher organic 
matter content observed in thin sections. There is, nevertheless, a sharp drop in TOC 
within this interval (ca. 15 to 31 m of part A) at 24,5 m. This drop is mimicked by the MS 
signal and the same roughly parallel curve is observed in the remaining section, with few, 
but noteworthy exceptions. After the sharp drop at 24,5 m there is sharp increase and a 
second sharp drop and the TOC values seem to remain low, contrary to the high MS 
values for the same interval (28-31 m). The gap above and significantly different sampling 
intervals preclude further correlations. The MS values at the base of the costatus zone (47-
48 m of part A) are not mimicked by the TOC curve. An inverse correlation is observed in 
the topmost part of the sequence (australis zone – part C) with a general decrease of the 
MS values and a general increase of TOC values.

6.2.3.2 Conodonts 
31 of the 33 samples collected and processed provided more than one hundred, 

mainly platform conodont elements. Only a few samples, however, provided well 
preserved specimens for identification and documentation including stratigraphically 
significant taxa regarding the current zonal concept. The CAI is estimated to be between 4 
and 5 corresponding to ca. 300ºC, coherent with the results obtained from the maturation 
of the organic matter.  

There are several problems with taxonomical delimitation in the Polygnathus stock 
just around the Emsian-Eifelian boundary. These are mostly expressed by difficulties in 
identification of taxa in the critical (boundary-defining) part of the Polygnathus costatus
lineage (Po. cost. patulus – Po. cost. partitus – Po. cost. costatus). The lineage suffers 
from lack of pronounced morphological change that would clearly characterize the 
succession of taxa whose stratigraphic ranges largely overlap (see Klapper et al., 1978; 
Berkyová, 2009). The zonally diagnostic taxa are also accompanied by a great number of 
morphologically variable forms appearing in short time-spans that preclude clear 
identification of the conodont indexes. In spite of these problems the platform conodont 
elements obtained from samples from Covas Ruivas, enabled to observe a moderate 
morphological progress in the costatus lineage and compare it successfully with the 
material figured from type localities in New York and the Barrandian. Some associated 
taxa (e.g. “Pandorinellina” cf. expansa Uyeno &amp;amp; Mason 1975 and Polygnathus aff. P. 
trigonicus Bischoff &amp;amp; Ziegler 1957) provided further biostratigraphical control. Many 
determinations out of 31 selected and photographed platform elements were left in open 
nomenclature due to breakage or uncertainties regarding some morphological features.  

The age of this sequence of the Odivelas Limestone is most probably latest Emsian 
to middle-late Eifelian (patulus – australis Zones). The clear morphology of Polygnathus
serotinus Telford, 1975 found in two samples would point to an “earlier” late Emsian age, 
but in regard of stratigraphic precision, there is a certain limitation due to its overlap with 
the stratigraphic range of all three problematic members of the costatus lineage (the 
Emsian "patulus" and the Eifelian "partitus" and "costatus" taxa). However the faunal 
succession in the Covas Ruivas locality indicates a high probability of late Emsian age of 
the lower part of the section (part A) (there are no associated "partitus" and "costatus" in 
samples with P. patulus). The Emsian/Eifelian boundary is probably at the level of sample 
R2.11c (22m) or closely below this level. The precision is affected by the density of 
successful conodont samples (see Fig. 6.2). Sample R2.19c (50 m) is already within the 
costatus Zone. The base of this zone is however obscured by the underlying gap. 
 The record of Polygnathus aff. P. cooperi cooperi Klapper et al., 1978 and 
Icriodus cf. beckmanni sinuatus Klapper et al., 1978 (i.e., typical taxa for the serotinus
Zone) in sample R2.48c which is already deep within the costatus Zone might be caused 
by repetition in the section or reworking, although there is no colour change or wear out of 
the respective specimens, neither significant faults, nor any other suggestion of repetition 
of the sequence in that part of the section (samples below and above are well within the 
costatus Zone). 

An important guiding conodont – Tortodus kockelianus australis Jackson, 1970 
appears in sample R2.58c. It is associated with typically middle-late Eifelian – early 
Givetian taxa as Polygnathus eiflius Bischoff &amp;amp; Ziegler, 1957, Polygnathus cf. 
pseudofoliatus Wittekindt 1966 and Polygnathus aff. ansatus Ziegler &amp;amp; Klapper, 1976. 
Due to stratigraphical overlap of T. k. australis Jackson, 1970 with subsequent zonal 
indexes and the above mentioned associated taxa (although some were left in open 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

263

nomenclature) that are characterized by a rather long range, an earliest Givetian age of the 
last sample R2.68c (top of part C) cannot be excluded.

6.2.3.3 Reef Fauna 
The exact determination of coral and stromatoporoid fauna is complicated by 

several factors related to the mode of preservation. First of all it is almost impossible to 
achieve the precise orientation of the sections, and it is due to strong fragmentation of 
colonies, as well as to the growth distortion within the small fragments and, occasionally, 
also to deformation (compaction or shear deformation). In addition, the early diagenetic 
changes caused that a significant part of original microstructures was changed or erased 
completely. Although many significant features in morphologies and microarchitecture of 
the skeletons remain, all the determinations had to be classified as being uncertain, at 
about a 60 to 80% level of reliability, so that the taxa in the approximate lists of faunas, as 
follows, must be used with question marks. In spite of this unavoidable degree of 
uncertainty, the rough outlines of the studied coral and stromatoporoid assemblages are 
remarkably wide:  

Tetracorals: Disphyllum sp., Grypophyllum sp., Neospongophyllum sp., 
Parasociophyllum isactis Frech, 1886, Petronella sp., Pseudamplexus sp., Solipetra sp., 
Spinophyllum sp., Stringophyllum sp., Syringaxon sp., and about 7 other, undetermined 
taxa (17 together).

Tabulate corals: Alveolitella sp., Alveolites edwardsi Lecompte, 1939, A. nalivkini 
Sokolov, 1952, Axuolites sp., Bainbridgia sp., Caliapora (Luciaella) sp., Caliapora
venusta Yanet, 1972, Celechopora sp., Celechopora devonica Schlüter, 1885, Cladopora
sp., Coenites sp., Dualipora sp., Hillaepora circulipora Kayser, 1879, Hillaepora sp., 
Lecomptia sp., Microalveolites sp., Planocoenites sp., Platyaxum sp., Remesia sp., 
Roemerolites sp., Scoliopora cruciformis Yanet, 1959, Scoliopora serpentina Yanet, 1972, 
Spongioalveolites sp., Squameoalveolites fornicatus Schlüter, 1889, Squameoalveolites
robustus Pradá ová 1938, Squameoalveolites sp., Striatopora sp., Striatopora ex gr. 
zeaporoides Dubatolov, 1963 , Taouzia sp., Thamnopora sp., and about 3 other, 
undetermined taxa (33 together).  

Heliolitids: Heliolites barrandei Penecke, 1887, H. porosus bilsteinensis Iven,
1980, H. porosus intermedius Le Maître, 1947, H. porosus porosus Goldfuss, 1826, 
Heliolites sp., H. vulgaris Tchernyshev, 1951, and 2 problematic forms (8 together).  

Rhapidoporids ('chaetetids'): Rhapidopora crinalis Schlüter, 1880, Rhapidopora
sp., and 2 undetermined, possible rhapidoporid taxa (4 together).

Stromatoporoids: Actinostroma perspicuum Nicholson, 1886, Actinostroma sp., 
Amphipora sp., Atelodictyon sp., Atopostroma sp., Bifariostroma sp., Clavidictyon sp., 
Dendrostroma sp., Ferestromatopora sp., Habrostroma sp., Hermatoporella sp., 
Hermatostroma sp., Hermatostromella sp., Labechia sp., Parallelopora sp., Plectostroma
sp., Pseudoactinodictyon sp., Salairella sp., Stachyodes (Sphaerostroma) sp., Stachyodes
(Stachyodes) sp., Stictostroma sp., Stromatopora sp., Syringostromella sp.,  
Trupetostroma sp., and about 7 difficultly classifiable taxa (31 together).  

The majority of above listed genera and possible species have European and 
territorially widespread Asian terrane records. Many of them also reach to north American 
realm (e.g., Grypophyllum) (Pl. 6.2G) or, on the other hand, are linked even to Australian 
basins (e.g., Pseudamplexus). Some taxa may be considered as being mostly the 
representatives of typically peri-Laurussian and Rhenish faunas (e.g., Alveolites edwardsi)



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

264

(Pl. 6.2B), but some taxa which are regularly connected with the peri-Gondwanan areas 
are also involved (e.g., Taouzia –an Ibarmaghian marker, Plusquellec &amp;amp; Hladil, 2001) (Pl. 
6.2H). The markers of the types as represented by Bainbrigia-Dualipora association or 
numerous forms of Heliolites (Pl. 6.2F) are indicative of settlements coming with open-
ocean migration routes (Tourneur, 1991), because these markers primarily contribute to 
coral colonizations on off-shore volcanic mounds, elsewhere. The stratigraphic 
significance of this faunal assemblage is only modest. It must be noted that the precise 
biostratigraphic correlation based on corals and stromatoporoids is basically impossible 
due to absence of specialized studies on coral assemblages which are strictly related to this 
BCE time window in particular. On the other hand, the prevailing 'Middle Devonian' 
character of the faunas puts significant constraints on any stratigraphically deeper 
recycling of older Emsian coral-stromatoporoid limestones.  

6.2.3.4 Magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy 
Hypothetically the volcanic-sedimentary setting of this section could preclude the 

application of magnetic susceptibility stratigraphy to it. The MS values are generally very 
low, indicative that the volcanic-derived admixture is very low and probably negligible 
(opposed to the carbonate-rich interbedded tuffites that had MS values one or two orders 
of magnitude higher). The insoluble residues from acetic acid and also hydrochloric acid 
show extremely rare particles that could have a volcanic origin (&lt;1mm, black rounded 
microgranular particles) but again the samples where these particles are slightly more 
common do not correspond to higher MS values. Pyrite is present, although rare, in 
samples with greater amount of organic matter.  However, the proportion of this non-
volcanic accessory material is known only approximately as it was estimated from the 
counts of diagenetically affected mineral aggregates and grains of 100 µm and larger sizes. 
The possibility that extremely fine volcanic-derived material (ashes) are present cannot be 
excluded. These are difficult to observe or detect and could affect the MS signal. There is 
an evident absence of terrigenous clastics in this facies association in general.

There seems to be no relation between the amount of non-carbonate material 
(volcanic or non-volcanic) with the MS values in this section (compare MS values to 
proportions of carbonate and non-carbonate particles in Fig. 6.2). The sensitivity of 
magnetic rock properties to background sedimentation components together with 
prevailingly low magnetism of volcanic admixtures in these limestones suggest that there 
is a good opportunity to trace general MS stratigraphic patterns which are not fully 
masked by noise from local volcanic and sedimentary regimes. These conclusions 
corroborate the observed similarities with inter-regionally juxtaposed MS stratigraphic 
curves (see below).

The upper Emsian and the lowest Eifelian MS records (part A) show an alternation 
of periods with high amplitude oscillations with highly oscillating intervals (between 0–
10 and 20–30 m), and the mean MS values are visibly elevated (14,25 and 11,8 m³.kg-1
respectively, contrasting with an overall section average of 3,57 m³.kg-1). Koptikova et al. 
(2007, 2008) described a coherent pattern of low MS values in different sections (Nevada 
– Lone Mountain section and Barrandian – Na Škrábku Quarry, Prastav Quarry and Red 
Quarry or ervený lom Quarry), occurring just before the BCE. In the Covas Ruivas 
section, this decrease was not observed but could correspond to the major gap in part A 
(Fig. 6.2 and Fig. 6.3, 36-47 m), as well as to the first sets of calciclastic (skeletal, 
lithoclastic and peloidal), rhythmically arranged beds above this lacuna. An abrupt 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

265

positive shift on MS values which ends the interval with low values occurs within these 
calciclastic series (around 47m). This shift is continued by irregularly structured patterns 
with high mean MS values (47–57 m). Above, a markedly developed decrease of MS 
values (from 11,17 to -1,9 m³.kg-1around 58 m) is observed, which might be considered as 
the starting of the BCE. However this interval of low MS values is not as significant as the 
pre-BCE low. Also the amplitudes of oscillations in this interval are higher than during the 
former low (68–80m of part A).  

6.2.4 Discussion and conclusions 
Conodont data point to a limestone deposition which can be most probably bracketed 

between the patulus and the australis Zones (latest Emsian – middle-late Eifelian). These 
results also indicate that there are no relevant gaps or repetitions within the sequence due 
to faulting. The volcanic activity of this part of the Beja Igneous Complex occurred before 
and after this time span as can be seen by the field stratigraphical relation. Volcanic 
activity in the immediate vicinity of the sedimentation area must have stopped to allow the 
development of the reef system and was probably extremely reduced in the region, as this 
was probably not an isolated reef (see below). 

The close palaeogeographical relation between the volcanic buildings of the oldest part 
of the Beja Igneous Complex and the limestone deposition is inferred by the gradual 
passage at the base and top of the section to tuffs/tuffites and by the existence of 
interbedded hemipelagites with a significant volcaniclastic component.

The general abundance of reef- (or platform-) derived bioclasts indicates that 
sedimentation took place in a peri-reefal environment. The coarser, usually massive base 
and the finer laminated top (and the intermediate cross bedded interval occasionally seen) 
suggest a low density calciturbidite type of sedimentation. Convolute bedding and slump 
structures are further indications of sedimentation on a slope. The fact that most beds 
show relatively fine grained and well sorted material (silt-sand, rarely coarser) indicates a 
considerable transport distance, implying that the deposition area is not in the close 
vicinity of a bioherm/biostrome. The intercalation of tuffites with hemipelagic 
characteristics constrain the sedimentation setting to the base of slope where basinal 
sedimentation is recorded between turbidity current events.  

The reef fauna diversity is quite unusual when compared with Middle Devonian faunas 
which are known from analogous tectonosedimentary settings, e.g., from the basalt heights 
of Horní Benešov, Moravia (Galle et al., 1995), Maly Bozkow, Central Sudetes (Hladil et 
al., 1999), or Ješt d Ridge, western Sudetes (Chlupá  &amp;amp; Hladil, 1992). The number of taxa 
for corals and stromatoporoids is about three times smaller at the localities which are used 
for comparison. However, a higher diversity was reported in the studies on corals and 
stromatoporoids of NW Sauerland (May, 1987, 1993). This unusually large spectrum of 
corals and stromatoporoids in Early Eifelian 'breccia' must be related to sources in 
complex, large and long-term surviving reefs, because only the large and complex 
platforms and reefs may provide numerous possible guilds and environments which do not 
represent only ephemeral or short-term colonizations. In addition, the faunal remains 
found in the 'breccia' bed are characteristic of various types of settings (calm water, inner 
backreef colonizers (e.g., Amphipora) to high energy water conditions of outer lagoon or 
reef-front (e.g. Stachyodes) or open-ocean colonizers (e.g., Bainbridgia, partly heliolitids) 
(Pl. 6.3A). Such a diversity and overlapping complexity of faunas can be either explained 
by possible existence of a really large volcanic complex, or may suggest a possible 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

266

juxtaposition of such a volcanic complex with some large crustal block beneath or in 
neighbourhood. However, the latter possibility seems to be constrained by lack of detrital 
quartz in these sedimentary rocks.  

The wide and complex palaeogeographical relationships of these faunas suggest that 
connection of this area with open ocean territories was good. A continuous, strong and 
diverse colonization flux of coral and stromatoporoid planulae and larvae was, most likely, 
an unavoidable precondition for the development of these high-diversity faunas.

The MS signal does not seem to be related to the amount of observed non-carbonate 
material and there is no evidence of relevant detritism – no quartz or other minerals 
associated with siliclastic input were observed. Thus a scenario where the major part of 
this impurity was delivered by atmospheric transport seems likely. Possible delivery of 
dust into the basin waters is almost regularly connected to enrichment of these marine 
areas in dissolved Fe-bearing solute species, and consequently, the fertilised aquatic 
conditions and also (bio)precipitation of highly magnetic phases may follow (Jickells, et 
al. 2005; Kaspari et al., 2009).

The intensity of magnetic signal is contrasting to small amounts of impurity in 
limestone and, therefore, is almost certainly associated with hematite or magnetite (Hladil 
et al., 2006).

In spite of a considerable uncertainty in conodont based correlation, which is highly 
indicative of stratigraphic levels but not describing them in detail, the arrangements of MS 
stratigraphic patterns in the section suggest the possibility for interregional comparison, 
even with distant places like Nevada, Uzbekistan or Morocco (Fig. 6.3). 

It is interesting to note that the onset of syn- to post-BCE calciclastites is a very 
important lithological marker inter-regionally (Koptikova et al., 2007; 2008), and the 
development of pre-BCE MS low with rapidly evolving spikes on MS curves within these 
calciclastites is a potentially applicable marker, at least for part of the Emsian-Eifelian 
sections and lithologies. The prospective application of these tentatively defined patterns 
and MS curve alignments seems to be strengthened by the common occurrence of MS 
oscillatory and stepwise decrease which occurs still within the levels with Po. costatus
costatus. (Koptikova et al., 2007; 2008) The deposition of coarse bioclastic and 
intraclastic, calciturbidites just after a pronounced period of deposition of low-carbonated 
hemipelagites is indicative of the record of the BCE in this section (Berkyová et al., 2008; 
Elrick et al., 2009). The richly bioclastic beds occur exclusively in the coral breccia 
interval, (between 58 and 61 m), and may relate to a typical, early costatus-Zone facies 
change (syn- to post-BCE calciclastites). 

The TOC curve roughly follows the overall trends which are seen in the MS curves 
which can be explained by the increased organic productivity (and consequent organic 
matter accumulation) induced by an increased delivery of dust (Kawahata et al., 2000). In 
detail there are many differences between the two curves. However, these differences can 
also be caused by natural variability of rock compositions or occurrence of 
inhomogenities. This variability must be considered between samples which are cm apart 
or even two parts of a sample with ~20-40 g. Considering the significant degree of 
similarity between TOC and MS, but an obvious dissimilarity between these two 
parameters and the amount of volcanic-derived impurities in the limestones (Fig. 6.2), one 
can infer that the burial of organic matter (or also increased primary productivity in open 
sea) was particularly linked to increased contents of non-volcanic clayey/silty 
components. The process when increased transport of aerosol with mineral dust into the 
oceans (MS on paramagnetic and ferri-/ferromagnetic minerals) causes increased organic

267

oceans (MS on paramagnetic and ferri-/ferromagnetic minerals) causes increased organic 
productivity and organic carbon burial (MS on diagenetic Fe-mineral phases) would be 
relevant to this case (e.g. Kawahata et al., 2000; Saltzman, 2005).

6.3 Cortes Locality 

6.3.1 Local Geological setting  
The Odivelas Limestone site near Cortes is composed of several natural and 

artificial outcrops and wide area of abundant loose boulders. The limestone was quarried 
and processed locally as can be seen by the ruins of an old lime mill. Nearly all the 
outcrops and most of the loose boulder area is flooded during the winter season. Although 
outcrops are scarce a limestone zonation is observable with bioherm limestones mainly in 
the centre and calicturbidite with crinoid fragments on the edges of the body (Fig.6.1D). 
Together with geometric information from bedding planes and foliation it is possible to 
infer that the limestone body corresponds to a small, badly defined, anticline structure. 

The main limestone body is surrounded by massive lava flows and rare pyroclastic 
deposits comprised in the Rebolado Basalts (Andrade et al., 1976). The same authors 
considered these to be the volcanic equivalents of the Casa Branca Dolerites that crop out 
to the W and SW due to the similar chemistry.  These dolerites were studied in more detail 
by Jesus et al. (2003, 2007) and Mateus et al., 2001 who refer the relatively young ages in 
the 355-320 Ma interval (~ Famennian/ Tournaisian to Visean). 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

268

The chronological relation between the basalts and limestones is unclear. Field 
evidence of the contacts is scarce, but the structural interpretation (and also facies) 
suggests that the limestones overlay the basalts. The presence of a small dyke intruding 
the limestones is indicative that at least the final part of the magmatic activity that 
generated the volcanic and sub-volcanic suite of the BIC is posterior (clearly intruding) to 
the limestone deposition. Chemical analyses show that limestones deposited 
contemporaneously with extrusive volcanic activity (see geochemical and petrographic 
analysis).  

A second, smaller, sector with limestone occurrences is present to the SE of the 
main one (Fig.6.1C). No outcrops are visible, just abundant loose limestone boulders, 
mainly calciturbidites. It is possible that this location is an old quarry or lime mill filled in 
with tailings and local detritus. 
The Tertiary deposits cover most of the northern area of the Odivelas reservoir and 
significant parts of the southern area. They are unconformably overlaying the volcanic 
suite and seem to have a topographic control leading to a local restriction of Beja Massif 
outcrops to valleys and other low land areas.  

6.3.2 Previous work 
Several short communications, papers and regional field trip guides (e.g. Andrade 

et al., 1991),  mention the Odivelas limestones and also the carbonates that occur near the 
reservoir wall but all of them refer to the original work by Conde &amp;amp; Andrade (1974). This 
was, therefore, the only work so far that described the palaeontology and location of the 
site and proposed a tentative limestone zonation. The fossil content described in Conde &amp;amp; 
Andrade (1974) includes stromatoporoids, corals, crinoids, brachiopods, bryozoans, 
conodonts and trilobites. The presence of fossils compared with Athyris concentrica and 
Thamnopora boloniensis (brachiopod and tabulate coral) was then regarded as evidence of 
a Middle or Upper Devonian age. The only described conodont taxa was Polygnathus sp. 
and no stratigraphical implication for this finding was made.  

6.3.3 Lithotypes and stratigraphy  

6.3.3.1 Petrographic and geochemical analyses 
Several outcrop samples were cut to produce thin sections and polished hand 

samples to be observed optically and to perform EDX and microprobe analyses. The 
bioherm limestone is dominated by biogenic particles in a micritic matrix (see 
palaeontological record section). The calciturbidite limestone has a homogeneous crypto- 
to microcristalline texture (Pl. 6.4E). In both lithotypes six main petrographic features 
were observed: 1) lamination (marked by ghosts of often well recognizable bioclasts and a 
first generation of stylolites); 2) feldspar sub-euhedral crystals; 3) second generation 
stylolites (Pl. 6.4G); 4) white and grey coarsely recrystallized areas and small veins, 5) 
Pumpellyite/prehnite and quartz rosettes (Pl. 6.4H); 6) late generations of veins with 
carbonate and feldspar, and finally but only in calciturbidites, 7) prismatic black particles 
(Pl. 6.4B to D and F) in size range from tenths of millimetre to centimetres. Original 
sedimentary features seem to be the abundant, mostly non-authigenic feldspar crystals and 
the lamination, later marked by a sub-parallel generation of stylolites. The WDS 
microprobe and EDX analyses indicate that up to 30% of the finer and darker limestones 
are composed of volcanic derived minerals such as chlorite, albite, oligoclase, microcline,

269

titanite, rare micas and altered pyrite, although only the feldspars and pyrite were observed 
optically.  

The black prismatic crystalloclasts which occur only in the calciturbidites can (in 
some levels only) constitute up to 20% of the limestone; their length ranges from 0.1 mm 
to 5 cm long (Pl. 6.4C and D), but the width of these elongated, partly or often euhedral 
specimens, exceeds 2.5– 3 mm. Usually they form single prisms, but occasionally also 
complex shapes are present (Pl. 6.4D). The transverse section is square, rhombic or 
irregularly hexagonal. The microprobe analyses show a core composed of hexagonal 
platelets of phlogopite retaining compositions as well as a very faint cleavage plane [001] 
which is sub-perpendicular to the prism axis. The high content of Al (up to 25%) is 
tentatively explained due to nanometric inclusions or mixtures between the mica layers, 
although this could not be confirmed. This core is interpreted as a forming in an early 
heating stage due to the contact metamorphism of the surrounding subvolcanic suite. The 
core is surrounded by an irregular, partially hollow cylinder composed by Mg-rich 
muscovite and biotite. The outer envelope defining the hexagonal prism is composed by 
chlorite and tosudite. These two outer layers are interpreted as diachronically forming or 
pseudomorphosing during late diagenesis and metamorphism. Some of the prisms have a 
porous structure which is filled by calcite, hematite and other minerals. Occasionally 
planar cracks and fissures (sub-perpendicular to the axis of the needle) are filled by 
calcite. This fracturing correspond to otherwise plastic shear deformation which is parallel 
to original lamination and can be compared to that which was observed on rarely 
thinsectioned conodonts. This deformation can start as early as with compaction of the 
rocks and early burial diagenesis.  

The major recrystalization areas and second generation of stylolites cut or affect 
the previous features. These represent a second phase of pressure solution and 
recrystallization of carbonate, contemporaneous with the main deformation phase as can 
be seen by the delta and sigmoid structures formed around the prismatic particles (Pl. 6.4E 
and F, Fig. 6.4). Finally, a second generation of veins (carbonates, perthitic alkali 
feldspars and rare quartz) cut the entire structure. They are usually thicker and with a more 
regular orientation which suggests fracture filling formed during a late deformational 
event (Pl. 6.4E and F, Fig. 6.4)or by adiabatic decompression.

6.3.3.2 Magnetic susceptibility 
In one of the artificial outcrops a small mostly undeformed sequence (ca. 2.4 m) of 

thin-bedded crinoidal calciturbidites was preserved. This section was sampled for 
magnetosusceptibility stratigraphy in ca. 10 cm intervals and for palynology in more 
spaced intervals. The results are summarized in Fig 6.5. According to the structural 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

270

interpretation the measured section (light grey shade) would be overlaying the bioherm 
beds (dark grey shade, Fig. 6.5), but the positioning is merely tentative. 

The data obtained from a short section with condensed stratigraphy can  be 
tentatively be assigned to the end-Eifelian segment 37-43 of  the MS Reference Section 
Moravian Karst (Hladil et al., 2006; Fig. 6.5 herein). This position seems to be determined 
by extremely low MS magnitudes together with medium amplitude "coarse brush 
patterns". The compared point in the reference section was originally held close to the 
base of Polygnathus ensensis stratigraphic correlatives (Hladil et al., 2006), but the most 
recent Belgian data (F. Boulvain et al., pers. commun. 2008) are highly indicative of little 
younger ages for this point, i.e. with Polygnathus hemiansatus age correlatives.  
Although the latter is quite concordant with the palaeontological record, several 
concurrent problems exist. A crude visual estimation of the proportion of the small black 
prisms in the magnetic susceptibility samples show a good correlation with the obtained 
MS curve. The measured MS values in isolated prims varies from 6.9 for complete 
specimens to 84.6 ( ·10-9 [m3 ·kg-1]) for the minute flakes composing their outer envelopes 
(Pl. 6.4D). Additionally, the not negligible proportion of fine-grained, mostly altered 
volcanic admixture (?volcanic ash and recycled microdetrital material) is expected to 
modify the MS record. In this context, however, the mean MS values which are smaller 
than 1 ·10-9 are very surprising and this can be explained by early diagenetic trapping of 
iron by pyrite and its late weathering alteration to iron oxyhydroxidic subcrystalline 
mixtures. Metamorphism, although low grade probably adds other noise or overprints the 
sedimentary MS variations. The obtained curve can, therefore, reflect the combination of 
several processes which may have modified the comparability of the original, wide 
regional to global (climatically induced) magnetosusceptibility stratigraphic record.

horizons and possible correlation with the published magnetic susceptibility curves for the same time 
interval (Hladil et al., 2006) and estimated conodont zone time equivalents (still under improvement 

by interregional correlation). The biostratigraphic correlatives for indicated point (base of 
Polygnathus ensensis Z.) can be updated by means of the most recent Belgian results (slightly younger, 

in Pol. hemiansatus Z.; Bultynck et al., pers. Commun. 2008). From Machado et al., 2009a

6.3.4 Palaeontological record 

6.3.4.1 Macrofauna 
Crinoids: Very common columnals of the crinoid genus Cupressocrinites are visible on 
the weathered rock surfaces or in slabs of the limestone sampled from relatively well 
preserved layers and boudins. These remarkable fossils are present across all discernible 
original sedimentary facies of the Odivelas Limestone on its type occurrence outcrops 
(i.e., from bioherms to calciturbidites). The largest about 5-7 mm wide columnals were 
regularly found with the coral-crinoid-brachiopod bioherm and biostrome relict structures. 
The large and medium sized columnals can be compared, according to their rough 
morphology, with Cupressocrinites cf. crassus ? (Goldfuss, 1831) or at least very similar 
forms – Pl. 6.5A–C. Some of small columnals having well separated peripheral canals 
may also be compared with Cupressocrinites sp. M ? Le Menn, 1999 (in Ureš et al., 
1999). The columnals having similarity to the latter taxon are found mainly in 
tempestites–calciturbidites which are interpreted as an original cover of the underlying 
biohermal-biostromal facies. These Cupressocrinites species occur together, for example, 
in the lowermost Givetian part of the Celechovice Limestone in Moravia, Czech Republic 
(e.g., Bou ek, 1931; Remes, 1939; Ureš et al., 1999; V. Petr, internet comments on the C.
crassus 2007). They are especially abundant in the Middle Devonian and particularly 
Eifelian–Givetian strata worldwide (i.e., among North Gondwana, South Baltica, Urals 
and Siberia basins and terranes) but they typically mark the Rhenish facies together with 
parallel, closely adjacent Variscan facies-tectonic belts on the inner side of the former and 
having a partial resemblance to pre-closure Rheic passages. Such a high abundance of 
Cupressocrinites remnants coupled with the presence of dark-grey coloured coral and 
stromatoporoid limestones is, therefore, a not negligible indication in order to prove that 
these sediments deposited in the middle of Variscan belts, and according to stratigraphic 
position close to the Eifelian/Givetian stratigraphic boundary. In spite of the predominance 
of these crinoid columnals, the presence of other crinoid genera is quite possible. Most of 
these genera, however, cannot be seriously determined on the base of the random sections, 
due to imperfectly preserved features of facet, areola, latus, etc. The only exception is for 
Gasterocoma ? sp. because its "rounded, double-axial-canal" in columnals and cirral 
ossicles which is well visible in the sections.

Tabulate corals: Owing the local thickening of originally calcite corallite walls the 
branches of Thamnopora tabulate corals belong to the most spectacular fossils which can 
be found in the less deformed layers and boudins of biohermal limestone facies. Whitish 
colour and positive weathering surfaces of these corals are eyecatching during collecting 
of the fossils, and this may lead to a slight overestimation of their relative abundances in 
comparison with other coral–stromatoporoid fauna of softer, Mg-calcite or aragonitic and 
thus less preservable skeletons. The present analysis of newly collected Thamnopora
specimens does not confirm the previous determinations (Conde &amp;amp; Andrade 1974) but 
suggests that majority of these branched coralla and their fragments most likely belong to 
Thamnopora  cf. irregularis Lecompte, 1939 (Pl. 6.5D–L). The main evidence for the 
revision of the previous determination as T. boloniensis (Gosselet, 1877) consists in the 
capability of this coral for frequent rejuvenations and irregular arrangement of the 
corallites as well as irregular budding and often imperfectly developed (or missing) 
separation of the thick-walled peripheral zone. The other supportive arguments for this 
determination are based on full agreement of the coralla and corallite shapes and mural

272

pore dimensions with the type populations of T. irregularis which were described from the 
"Gia" levels (Lecompte 1939) [in the present stratigraphic terms: Hanonet Formation / 
Trois Fontaines Member in the Dinant Synclinorium, Belgium ~ Polygnathus hemiansatus
Zone]. Besides this dominant species also some small and rare forms and one medium-
sized form are present, but their determination is very difficult. These forms resemble in 
some of their poorly preserved features T. cf. compacta minima ? Sharkova, 1981, T. cf.
incerta perpussila Hladil, 1984, T. cf. vermicularis ? (McCoy, 1850) and T. cf. 
bilamellosa ? Ermakova, 1960. Although the presence of these species remain highly 
problematic, it is interesting that all these possible links are also focused to the Eifelian–
Givetian ages, and palaeogeographically are also indicative of the same space as the above 
mentioned high abundance of the Cupressocrinites crinoid remains.  

Other prominent component among tabulatomorphic (but not tabulate) corals are 
colonies of Heliolites. Domical and short cylindrical colonies prevail. Also the colonies 
with several centimetres thick overgrowths by undetermined massive coenostea of 
stromatoporoids are commonly seen in the bioherm–biostrome facies in central part of the 
Odivelas Limestone type occurrence outcrops, but their subtle skeletons were often and 
considerably damaged by recrystallization. A few uncoated colonies with at least partial 
preservation of visible internal structures (Pl. 6.6A–F) were classified as Heliolites cf. 
porosus bilsteinensis ? Iven, 1980, but also a certain similarity to Heliolites "Typus C" 
Hubmann, 1991 must be considered and partly also to the youngest forms of 
problematically defined H. cf. vulgaris Tchernyshev, 1951 (e.g., Hladil &amp;amp; Lang 1985). 
The morphologies like H. porosus bilsteinensis, and considering also these three 
morphologically related forms are quite indicative of the Eifelian–Givetian and 
particularly the earliest Givetian ages. On the other hand, there is no evidence for the 
presence of the typical septate heliolites as H. porosus porosus (Goldfuss, 1826) or H.
"intermedius" Le Maitre, 1947 which are also typical for these stratigraphic levels but 
occur rather in thicker limestones around platforms than in thin limestone layers on 
volcanic substrates. Despite of a certain tendency for the reduction of coenenchymatic 
tubulae, the possible comparison with H. barrandei Penecke, 1887 is hindered by the 
absence of rudimentary but thickened bases of septa as well as local thickenings of the 
parts of the skeleton as a whole (compare, e.g., Fernández-Martínez 1999).  

The small favositid-like, nodularly or domically shaped centimetre-sized coralla 
often have characteristics of caliaporids (rotation of parallel corallites, presence of battens, 
indications of squamulae). However, the presence of Calipora battersbyi (Milne-Edwards 
&amp;amp; Haime, 1851), Mariusilites chaetetoides (Lecompte, 1939) or their Eifelian precursor 
species lack unambiguous evidence in this recrystallized coral material. In contrast to this, 
several colony remains (perhaps randomly preserved?) provided sufficient indications that 
one of these caliaporids can be labelled as Caliapora ? cf. plagiosquamata Hladil, 1981 
(Pl. 6.6G–I). This coral has all the evident though moderately reduced Caliapora type 
features. Its occurrence is typical for the Givetian stage, ranging in Moravia from the 
Eifelian–Givetian to Middle Givetian strata. 

Many observed and analysed colonies must likely be encompassed within 
alveolitids, specifically between the genera Squameoalveolites and Spongioalveolites. The 
best evidence was found for several coating to low domical colonies of relatively compact 
skeleton which were determined as Squameoalveolites cf. fornicatus (Schluter, 1889) – Pl. 
6.6J–M. Corallite have an evident alveolitid shape where densely spaced and well opened 
mural pores are on the lateral sides and are regularly alternated by couples of thick, 
tongue-shaped skeletal protrusions which resemble formations of "squamulae or spines". 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

273

Again, the species is very typical for the Eifelian–Givetian and lowermost Givetian strata 
worldwide and mainly in Rhenish and adjacent marine basins.  

Other fossils apparent among well preserved, thick skeleton branched tabulate 
corals are scolioporids with subdominant Scoliopora denticulata denticulata (Milne-
Edwards &amp;amp; Haime, 1851) cf. alpha morfotype Hladil, 1984 – Pl. 6.7A–D. The corallites 
elongated in the transverse section have flattened, rounded-rectangular to bean shapes, and 
despite and in spite of the corallite rotation after the budding they tend again to be sub-
parallel near the colony surface. Septal ridges are always well visible, as well as the 
typical galleries of tube-like pores. The morphology of these corals is in agreement with 
that of the old Givetian populations from the Lazanky-Zrcadla locality in Moravia. The 
presence of this species is quite interesting from two points. First, this coral in Moravia 
usually occurs on platforms and their slopes and, second, it is rather indicative of earliest 
Givetian ages than the Late Eifelian. As this coral most likely belongs to very slowly and 
consistently growing microsuspension feeders which can also considerably exceed from 
the territorial ranges of typical reef communities (e.g., settling on slopes, and vice versa, in 
the sheltered environments only with amphiporids) it is not surprising that these 
Scoliopora branches were also here preferentially embedded in originally ?micritic–
micropeloidal sediments that have relatively low admixture of the skeletal debris.   

Rugose corals: There was a rich, moderately diversified assemblage of these corals in the 
materials collected from the fragmentary bioherm–biostrome structures in the centre of the 
type Odivelas Limestone locality. Corals which were determined as Pseudamplexus ? sp. 
(Pl. 6.7F–I) are slightly dominant. Most of these corals occur in clusters and accumulated 
in lenses, where complete specimens are more abundant than millimetre to centimetre 
detritus of their calices. Typical original sediments were most likely ? ostracod 
packstones/wackestones, although more diversified skeletal packstone varieties occur as 
well. It seems that some populations differ in the shape, as longer conical shapes with less 
cemented skeleton can be found and also forms with deeper and more opened calices 
where the skeletons were filled and coated by early cements, but the more detailed 
taxonomic conclusions are restricted by poor preservation of most of the internal 
structures.

Among well represented groups mainly the Digonophyllinae must be mentioned. 
Large conical to keg-shaped corals filled by large dissepiments are labelled as 
Cystiphylloides ? sp. (Pl. 6.7K). Large rugose corals with relatively well indicated length 
and arrangement of septa were determined as Mesophyllum ? sp. (Pl. 6.7L).  
Presence of other genera, e.g. phillipsastreids Disphyllum ? sp., locally also 
Thamnophyllum ? sp. and Peneckiella ? sp. is quite possible due to observed general 
growth forms but lack the evidence based on preserved internal skeletal structures. The 
same is true for possible but not definitely confirmed occurrences of Acanthophyllum ? sp.  

On the other hand, the sub random preservation and sectioning of limestones 
provided a tentative evidence for the presence of various other rugose corals: for example, 
Calceola cf. sandalina (Linne, 1771) – Pl. 6.7M, Pseudodigonophyllum ? sp. – Pl. 6.7N, 
Holmophyllum ? sp. (Holmophyllum ? cf. uralicum Zhavoronkova, 1972) – Pl. 6.8A, or 
Cyathopaedium ? sp. – Pl. 6.8B.  

Occurrences of Pseudamplexus, Cystiphylloides and Mesophyllum correspond well 
to the Eifelian–Givetian ages, and the occurrences of other very briefly mentioned genera 
are not in conflict with this age determination. In addition, the single finds and 
determinations of other rugose corals support these ideas about age of these faunas. 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

274

Calceola sandalina, although relatively rare, is an important cosmopolitan marker for 
these ages and a very characteristic species of Rhenish and adjacent seas. 
Pseudodigonophyllum ? sp. and Holmophyllum ? cf. uralicum also confirm these ages, and 
Cyathopaedium ? sp. shows a parallel to occurrences of  Cyathopaedium paucitabulatum
(Schluter, 1879) in the upper part of the Newberria Formation, lower Givetian of western 
Sauerland, Germany (May 2003). 

Stromatoporoids (and amphiporids): The stromatoporoids are certainly an important 
faunal component of the bioherm–biostrome structures in the central part of the Odivelas 
Limestone type locality, but their originally aragonitic to Mg-calcitic skeletons were 
recrystallized during both the diagenesis and slight metamorphosis to a degree which even 
precludes their generic identification. Only some of the observed relict structures allow 
speculating about possible occurrence of Actinostroma ? (or Plectostroma ?) [thick, well 
separated pillars], Salairella ? [preponderance of regular coenosteles], Atelodictyon ?
[strongly expressed laminated features of coenosteum] and Clathrocoilona ? [very densely 
structured coatings on corals]. However, this must be considered only in a category of 
tentative and disputable opinions, not bringing the facts which could be supported by 
unequivocal evidence.

It is significant that the abundance of stromatoporoids and their overall shape 
diversity rapidly increased at the transition between the bioherm–biostrome structures and 
overlying tempestites and calciturbidites. Judging only on the base of coenosteal outer 
morphologies in the rock slabs, one can speculate about the possible presence of 
?Stachyodes together with massive and coating coenostea of the genera with easily 
recrystallizable skeletons (e.g., ?Stromatopora, ?Taleastroma, ?Stromatoporella,
?Anostylostroma, etc.).

The poor preservation of this fauna therefore means nothing more than that 
stromatoporoids are certainly present, but they can hardly be used for any detailed 
estimates in terms of systematics, stratigraphy and palaeogeography. 

In comparison with the major part of these undeterminable stromatoporoid 
skeletons, the preservation of some rare amphiporids is better. They occur only in relicts 
of some biostromal structures, in the centre of the limestone body and close to the basalts, 
and they were locally preserved in a very specific way. The coating by algal–bacteria? 
"stockings" together with burial in the lime-mud led to a post-mortem concentration of the 
organic matter in the porous but closed skeleton with resulting in a reduced carbonate 
cementation and increased silicification. The analysis of weathered silicified fragments in 
combination with unsilicified accumulations of these fossils in rock slabs and thin sections 
suggests the presence of Amphipora ? cf. spissa Yavorsky, 1957 (Pl. 6.8C–K). Concerning 
the stocking-like coatings both the cyanobacteria and algal coatings must be considered, 
i.e., Wetheredella ? sp. (sensu Kazmierczak &amp;amp; Kempe 1992) and Gymnocodium ? sp, 
respectively. Relicts of both structures were preserved. Particularly the silicified fragments 
and some of the appropriately weathered surfaces provided an undoubted image of the 
amphiporid skeleton structures. The quite regular internal structures, large size of these 
branches and irregular occurrences of axial canals in them are actually pointing to 
Amphipora ? spissa or closely related forms. These forms are particularly common in the 
Eifelian–Givetian limestones, where they are either accompanied or alternated by the 
cosmopolitan species A. ramosa (Phillips, 1841). Several small silicified fragments of thin 
cylindrical specimens with roughly structured skeleton tissues (indicating the "sabre"-
shaped pillars), regular axial canal and well separated outer gallery of chambers were also 



Machado, G. Upper Paleozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal

275

found, but it is difficult to decide whether they really represent A. ramosa or only some 
morphological extremes within the population of A. spissa (or other amphiporid). It is 
possible, that also a few stachyodid or coral branches were admixed in the more 
recrystallized accumulations of these ca. 0.5cm wide cylindrical fossils.  

Amphiporids dominated the sheltered areas of platforms, but in small amounts they 
were found also on isolated, drowning elevations with basalts (e.g. at Horni Benesov in 
Moravia; Galle et al. 1995).

Brachiopods: The accumulations of brachiopod shells are relatively common at the base 
of biohermal structures, and were observed in several places in the centre of the type 
locality. Rare fragments of these coquinas (together with coral and coral–stromatoporoid 
facies) were found also in rock fragments around the eastern Odivelas limestone body, 
although this body is characteristic by preponderance of crinoidal calciturbidites. In spite 
of their relatively common occurrences according to our newly collected material the 
presence of Athyris concentrica (von Buch, 1834) reported by Conde &amp;amp; Andrade (1974) 
cannot be confirmed.  

Especially the largest and thickest brachiopod shells (7 to 12 cm long specimens) 
have internal structures which cannot be compared with this species, and in addition they 
do not correspond to the basic structures of many of the commonly known brachiopod 
genera (consulted with by U. Jansen, 2007). These brachiopod shells are reported under 
the working name Brachiopoda gen. et sp. indet. (Type Y) – compare Pl. 6.8L–O. These 
very thick shells are preferentially preserved, and this corresponds to the assumption that 
they were thicker and larger than the opposite valves, i.e., one can speculatively infer that 
they most likely were pedicle valves on ventral its side of this brachiopod. The most 
spectacular feature of these valves is the presence of extremely thick ventral medium 
septa. The cross sections of their posterior parts, where these shells have typically a width 
of 3–5 cm, show commonly a thick septum which is closely connected with other connate 
skeletal elements, forming typical bulky shapes of "capital upsilon". It is interesting that 
these brachiopod shells were not yet documented by the systematic palaeontology. These 
shapes were observed on two localities of the Czech and Polish Sudetes, and both of these 
localities have very similar successions of the Givetian limestones which deposited on 
submerging basalt seafloor highs (Padouchov in the Ješt d Mountain Ridge, Chlupá  &amp;amp; 
Hladil, 1992; and Ma y Bo ków in Klodzko area, Hladil et al., 1999). Similarity of these 
brachiopods within this Variscan belt structure resembles the conclusions which can be 
made on the base of the Odivelas coral faunas.  

The small brachiopod shells found as a positive relief on the weathered rock 
surfaces (Pl. 6.8P–Q) were left without determination, because there is no more than one 
shell. Very speculatively, there is a possibility to compare these shells with Cranaena ? sp. 
or similar brachiopods. With similarly low validity of assumptions one can speculate 
about presence of Kaplex or Stringocephalus shells in the deformed brachiopod coquinas 
(e.g. Pl. 6.8R), but also without any direct evidence. It is caused mainly by the tectonic 
deformation of these shell accumulations which make it difficult to successfully 
reconstruct the shapes of the valves on the basis of such haphazardly oriented and 
deformed sections.

6.3.4.2 Micropalaeontology 
A small preserved sequence of the calciturbidite deposits was sampled for 

palynology analysis. HCl attack destroyed nearly all the mineral fraction. Concentrated 
HF attack was preformed but it had little effect on the residue. The organic residue was 
quite abundant. Black opaque heavily thermally altered (sensu Batten, 1983) amorphous 
organic matter was the most abundant component of the residue. Rare complete 
leiosphere-type palynomorphs were observed. Skeletal remains of acritarchs and grey 
organic tissues were more commonly seen. In some of the samples skeletal remains of 
acritarchs were quite common, attributable to spheromorphs, acantomorphs and 
polygonomorphs (Fig.6.6). Long grey branching filaments were also found in some of the 
samples (Fig.6.6). Although poorly preserved, this assemblage suggests a relatively high 
initial diversity that was subsequently destroyed by diagenetic and metamorphic activity.

From Machado et al., 2008 

Three samples from different outcrops (two from the bioherm type and one from 
the calciturbidite type) were collected for conodont studies and dissolved with 10% acetic 
acid. The 30 and 120µm fractions were thoroughly examined after acetic acid dissolution 
and a single Icriodus sp. specimen was found which does provide useful biostratigraphic 
information. Rare ghosts of conodont elements found by means of thinsectioning were 
partly dephosphatized and fragmented. The residue was composed by a carbonaceous 
material, probably organic matter. Small amounts of quartz crystals were present as well 
as pyrite (heavily corroded). From the calciturbidite sample, the coarser fraction (&gt;120µm) 
was dominated by black prismatic particles, usually with less than 2 cm in length (see 
petrographic analyses).

6.3.5 Discussion and conclusions 
From the described fauna it is possible to constrain the age of the Odivelas 

limestones to an interval between the uppermost Eifelian and lowermost Givetian. The

277

most frequently indicated ages of the sediments dominated the main body of the classical 
Odivelas Limestone seem to be centred roughly about stratigraphic equivalents of the 
Polygnathus hemiansatus Zone. However, it cannot be completely excluded that closely 
adjacent limestone occurrences would contain also some subordinated, stratigraphically 
condensed partial sequences (or lenses) of older (?Eifelian) and younger (?Givetian) ages.  

The magnetic susceptibility results do not clarify the stratigraphical positioning 
and their correlation with the Ka ak-Event lowest MS magnitudes and possible patterns is 
only tentative, having only slight supportive weight in comparison with biostratigraphical 
indications. It is mainly due to volcanic admixture in limestones and their slight 
metamorphosis.    

The field, petrographic and geochemical data are indicative that volcanic and 
subvolcanic activity took place before, during and after the limestone deposition and that 
at least part of subvolcanic activity was syn or post-deformational.  

The deposition of limestone was most likely dependant on a volcanic building, 
with the shallower areas supporting a bioherm-biostromal system with calciturbidite-type 
sedimentation on the flanks and in the surrounding deeper areas. The described faunal 
assemblages dominated by crinoids, heliolitids, solitary rugose corals and brachiopods  are 
suggestive of sedimentation on basalt seafloor highs developed along the inner side of the 
central Variscan facies-tectonic belts as recorded elsewhere in Europe and particularly in 
Rhenish facies areas. The relevant palaeogeographical constraints are inferred, e.g. from 
the occurrences of Cupressocrinites, Calceola and spectrum of possible tabulate coral 
taxa.

The Pedreira de Engenharia formation (Évora-Beja Domain, Ossa-Morena Zone), 
comprising calciturbidites and providing Eifelian conodonts can tentatively be compared 
with the Odivelas Limestone setting, but the palaeogeography and palaeoenvironmental 
conditions of the latter are unknown and contemporaneous volcanic activity in the area as 
not been recognized. Further work in the Pedreira de Engenharia area is needed to assess 
the relation between the two areas. 

The new data presented here contributes to the better understanding of the 
palaeogeography of the southern border of the Ossa-Morena Zone and the Variscan 
deformation in SW Europe. 

6.4 Limestone units included in the Toca da Moura 
Volcano-Sedimentary complex 

6.4.1 Local geological setting 
The Toca da Moura unit was rightfully called a volcano-sedimentary complex (e.g. 

Santos et al., 1987; Pereira et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006) considering the variety of 
lithologies that crop out in a restricted area and the complexity of their geometrical 
relations. In older literature the slates of this complex are informally called “Xistinhos”. 
The better defined and described part are the marine sediments and associated basalts and 
pyroclastic deposits (and pyroclastic derived material) from the Corte Pereiro locality, 
Cai-Água and other localities which were dated using miospores by Pereira &amp;amp; Oliveira 
(2001) and Pereira et al., 2006 and described in a subsequent work in Oliveira et al., 2001. 
The age was bracketed between the late Tournaisian CM and late Viséan NM miospore 
Biozones of Clayton et al. (1977) (Pereira et al., 2006). The latter work also showed that

the Cabrela complex that crops out further North is coeval in age and probably belongs to 
the same volcano-sedimentary complex. The geochemistry and petrology of the basaltic 
parts of the complex were described in Santos et al. (1987) and more recently in Oliveira 
et al. (2006). Other papers were published by Gonçalves (1985) and Gonçalves &amp;amp; 
Carvalhosa (1984) that generally describe the complex and present detailed mapping of 
some areas. The unit also contains several Fe and Cu ore deposits (Relvas, 1987; Oliveira 
et al., 2006) that were commercially explored (e.g. Corte Pereiro, Caeirinha, Toca da 
Moura).

The complex is restricted to a few areas along the Ferreira-Ficalho fault zone, the 
Santa-Susana shear zone and scattered over older Ossa-Morena units (Fig.6.7A). The 
original extent of the unit was discussed in Santos et al. (1987) and in Pereira et al. (2006) 
and Oliveira et al. (2006). 

Within this unit there are several limestone occurrences which are usually heavily 
recrystalized and silicified (most of them can be considered to be marbles and 
metassomatic cherts), significantly deformed and often contain or are associated with Fe 
and/or Cu mineralizations (Relvas, 1987; Oliveira et al., 2006). The age and nature of 
these limestones remained unclear for a long time, except the lenses in the Cabrela area 
which were dated as Frasnian by conodonts (Van den Boogaard, 1983) and later 
interpreted as olistoliths in Tournaisian pelitic deposits (Pereira et al., 2006). 
 In this work badly preserved but identifiable sections of crinoidal stems and 
possible algal remains are reported in two of these limestone bearing groups of outcrops.  

6.4.2 Monte da Pena locality 
 This locality is composed of several small areas (&lt;400m2) with rare outcrops and 
very abundant loose boulders of limestones and heavily silicified lithologies, probably 
metasomatic cherts derived from marbles and limestones. These areas run along a WNW-
ESE trend corresponding to the Ferreira Ficalho fault (Fig.6.7C). The limestones are 
closely associated with the volcanic rocks of the Toca da Moura complex and the felsic 
rocks of the Baleizão porphyry (s.l.). There is an intense oxide mineralization and 
silicification that replaces both limestones and volcanic rocks especially along the 
Northern edge of the limestone alignment. 
 A few limestone outcrops in old quarries (currently mostly filled with local detritus 
and vegetated) allow a glimpse of what seems to be the original geometry and general 
facies: bedded limestones intercalated with volcanic rocks. The reduced number and size 
of the outcrops and the intense recrystalization preclude any further interpretations.

6.4.2.1 Macropalaeontology and facies 
 As in other localities some loose boulders have suggestive particles on weathered 
surfaces although no bioclasts could be positively recognized. These occur mostly in the 
southern edge of the alignment where recrystalization and mineralization seem to be 
milder. 
 Cutting and later polishing of the sampled boulders allowed the identification of a 
limestone which was likely originally a crinoidal grainstone (Pl. 6.14), but suffered intense 
recrystalization with veining and replacement of carbonate by silica. Most crinoidal 
elements are small columnal plates (&lt;1mm), with simple circular outline and a small 
circular central canal.  Some rare, bigger columnal plates can be tentatively identified as 
Gasterocomids and possibly Cupresocrinitids (Pl. 6.14).

 Several boulders of crinoidal limestones were processed for conodont analysis as a 
composite sample but no conodont elements were found.

6.4.3 Caeirinha locality 
The Caeirinha locality is known in the regional geological literature as a small Cu 

mine within the Toca da Moura complex (Relvas, 1987; Oliveira et al., 2006) and within 
the Santa Susana shear zone domain. The site is also refered to as Caeira and Vermelha 
(local farm houses). Besides the mildly deformed basalts and associated sediments of the 
Toca da Moura Complex there is a relatively large limestone body (ca. 1000 X 370m 
maximum length and width) with oxide mineralization around it and with metassomatic 
replacement around the edges (Fig. 6.7B). The limestone body is heavily recrystalized and 
silicified. In the area there are a few natural outcrops along stream beds (basalts and pelitic 
sediments), a small abandoned quarry/open pit mine (silicified limestones) and abundant 
loose boulders (especially of the limestones and the oxide ore). The geometrical relations 
between the several rock types in the area are unclear. 

6.4.3.1 Macropalaeontology, micropalaeontology and facies 
Loose boulders of the Caeirinha locality were preferably sampled near the central 

part of the limestone body where, at least apparently, the deformation, recrystalization and 
mineralization are milder. Some of the boulders had suggestive particles naturally etched 
out on weathered surfaces, although no bioclasts could be recognized. Cutting and later 
polishing of the boulders showed that most of the sampled limestones were originally 
composed, almost entirely, by crinoidal elements (mostly columnal plates), most of them 
very small (&lt;1mm) and the rock has a considerably low proportion of matrix. Although 
uncertain it seems the original limestone was a crinoidal packstone/wackstone (Pl. 6.10). 
The larger and more discernible columnal plates (in transverse section) were dominated by 
Gasterocomids and (?)Cupresocrinitids. (Pl. 6.10, 6.11, 6.12 and 6.13). Other simple 
morphologies were present, namely circular outline columnal plates with a small circular 
axial canal. Other fossils can be tentatively identified as calcareous algae (Pl. 6.9E and F) 
and ostracod shells (Pl. 6.9A) but these were rare and too damaged to perform any 
conclusive taxonomic identification.  

Several boulders of crinoidal limestones were processed for conodont analysis as a 
composite sample, but no conodont elements were found. The amount of insoluble residue 
was quite big, consisting mostly of silicates and oxides. Some rare heavily corroded 
columnal plates attributable to Gasterocomids were found in the residue (e.g. Pl. 6.11H). 

Two samples from the pelitic sediments of the Toca da Moura Complex where 
collected for palynology analysis (CAE 2.1 and CAE3.1 - see Fig. 6.7B). The organic 
residues provided badly preserved palynomorphs, mostly miospores. The following taxa 
where observed Convolutispora sp.; Densosporites rarispinosus Playford, 1963; 
Densosporites sp.; Dictyotriletes sp.; cf. Dibolisporites sp., Lophozonotriletes cf. bellus 
Kedo 1963; Lycospora cf. pussila (Ibrahim) Somers, 1972; aff. Raistrickia variabilis 
Dolby &amp;amp; Neves, 1970; Rugospora cf. flexuosa (Juschko) Streel, 1974; Spelaeotriletes 
balteatus (Playford) Higgs, 1996 and Verrucosisporites nitidus (Naumova) Playford, 
1964. Rare acritarchs assignable to (?)Gorgonisphaeridium sp. and Leiosphaeridia sp. 
were also recorded.

6.4.4 Age and interpretation of Monte da Pena and Caeirinha 
localities

The common presence and the high proportion of gasterocomids and 
(?)cupressocrinitids columnal plates in all observed samples are indicative of an acme of 
these genera in the reef biota. This acme has been described in several areas of the 
European Variscides, namely from elechovice and Konice (Czech Republic) (Ureš et al., 
1999; Galle &amp;amp; Hladil, 1995), and Armorican Massif (Le Menn, 1985) for a time interval 
ranging from the uppermost Eifelian to lowermost Givetian. Additionally and perhaps 
more importantly, the dominant presence of Cupressocrinites sp. and common presence of 
Gasterocoma sp. columnals was described recently in Machado et al., (2009) for the 
Odivelas Limestone classical locality (some tenths of Kms to the SE) which provided a 
typical coral assemblage of the same time interval. As discussed by G uchowski, (1993) 
the identification of several genera based solely on their stem columnals is generally valid 
for the Cupressocrinites genus, but this and other genera of similar morphology are 
present in younger Devonian and even Tournaisian sediments. The original lithofacies are 
difficult to interpret due to the poorly preserved sedimentary features at a meso and 
microscopic scale and the total absence of information at a macroscale. Nevertheless there 
is a striking resemblance of the petrographic characteristics and bioclasts association 
between the Caeirinha limestones and the crinoidal calciturbidite facies described for the 
Odivelas Limestone classical locality (cf.Pl. 6.5 A, C). It is likely that other lithofacies 
may have been originally present (e.g. biostromal/bioherm) but are now completely 
obliterated by the intense deformation and metasomatism. 
 The described miospore assemblage is coherent with the previously described 
assemblages for the TMC (Pereira et al., 2006) which contain reworked miospores. The 
presence of Lycospora cf. pussila (Ibrahim) Somers, 1972 is indicative of the Pu miospore 
biozone of Clayton et al. (1977) – latest Tournaisian – earliest Viséan. The remaining taxa 
may be, at least in part, reworked. The presence of Middle Devonian Limestones within a 
volcano-sedimentary complex that has been, for the most part, dated as Viséan-
Tournaisian can have 2 possible explanations. Considering the previous record of 
olistoliths in the associated Cabrela complex (Pereira et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006), 
one can easily assume the same setting for the Caeirinha (and possibly the Monte da Pena) 
locality. Despite this relatively straightforward explanation, one must consider the 
localities are within important shear zones. The possibility that the limestone body is 
merely tectonically imbricated with the surrounding (younger) rocks can not be discarded

conodont biozones.

B Detail of a coarse pyroclastic deposit a few meters below the first limestone beds. 
C Hand specimen scale image of a finely laminated tuffite (facies t1) in the patulus

zone where the limestones are subordinate to tuffites. Note the dark grey organic 
mater-rich laminae alternating with the coarser and lighter laminae.  

D Microscopic image (white transmitted light) of limestone facies ca1 in basal partitus
zone. Note the (locally) common radiolarians and peloids. 

E Limestone lense (arrows) interbeded with finely laminated tuffites within the lower 
partitus zone. 

F Microscopic image (white transmitted light) of a grainstone belonging to facies ca1 
within costatus zone. Note the abundant crinoid skeletal elements (cri) and the rare 
intraclasts (int) and tentaculites (tent).

G General appearance of the section within the costatus zone (part B). Note the thicker 
limestone beds (grainstones) and the subordinate, much thinner, interbeded tuffites. 

H Slumped bed in lower costatus zone. The slump “head” contains reworked material 
from both tuffite and limestone beds. 

I Small scale trough cross-bedding at the top of a limestone bed, overlaid by a tuffite 
bed.

J General appearance of the section in lower australis zone (part C). Note the thicker 
limestone beds and the subordinate tuffites, as in most of the costatus zone below. 
Compare with G. 

K Panorama of parts B and C of the section, separated by a faulted zone. The 
approximate extension of the conodont biozones is shown. The first part of the 
section is seen in the background in the upper left.

A Diversified coral and stromatoporoid bioclasts, all being altered to various degree; 

crinoid columnals and ostracods are scattered in this material. ‘Sol’ - rugose coral 
Solipetra; ‘Hil’ - tabulate coral Hillaepora; Sta - stromatoporoid Stachyodes.
Erosional contact with an interleaving bed of finer calciturbidite is seen at the base 
(above the lower edge of the picture).

B A part of rock, where fragments of stromatoporoids prevail, occurring together with 
Rhapidopora, Hillaepora and amphiporids. ‘Spi’ - rugose coral Spinophyllum, ‘Ple’ 
- stromatoporoid Plectostroma. Note the early diagenetic, silicified and partly 
desilicified patches in cemented skeleton of Plectostroma.

C Densely packed coral detritus is mixed with originally semi-lithified intraclasts of 
different compositions: from grainstones (upper right corner) to dark grey 
calcisiltites (lower part of this picture). ‘Cel ‘- tabulate coral Celechopora, ‘Str’ - 
tabulate coral Striatopora.

D Coarse grained calciturbidite with crinoidal debris contains a medium large, sub-
rounded intraclast of calcisiltitic-mud sedimentary rock. The rock has evidently a 
deeper and pelagic environmental affinity if compared with shallow water debris of 
reef builders in ‘breccia’. Photographs taken directly in field, by G. Machado.  ‘Int’ 
– intraclast; ‘Cep’ - two small cephalopod shells, with telescopic insertion of one 
shell into another.  

E to H – Macroscopic views. Natural weathering of these rocks has very selective effect 
on altered and ‘fresh’, pure calcite bioclasts; i.e., the most of 'fresh' bioclasts are not so 
nicely seen in the relief.  
E Str - rugose coral, possibly Stringophyllum (or Neostringophyllum?), Alv - 

Alveolites edwardsi. Note that slightly visible skeleton structures (in grey colour 
hues, just above the alveolitid colony as marked) may suggest a presence of a 'fresh' 
heliolitid skeletal fragment .

F A medium large fragment of a colony of Heliolites porosus is embedded mostly in 
fine grained calciturbiditic grainstone. The weathering-resistant margins typically 
contain increased amounts of silica and dolomite.  

G Gry - rugose coral Grypophyllum. This coral is embedded in diversified detritus of 
millimetre sized clasts of pure calcite compositions, where only few crinoid ossicles 
are selectively weathered and have positive relief and brownish colour hues 
(because of slight dolomite and silica contents; mix of differently altered clasts 
from different parts of the reef and slope areas).

H A partly abraded branch of tabulate coral Taouzia, marked as Tao in the picture. 
This coral is present in the layers where also intraclasts richer in original clayey and 
silica components occur; see the fractured intraclast in the upper right corner of the 
picture, for example.

Plate 6.5  - Crinoids and corals from the Cortes locality. From Machado et al. 2009a. 

A–C – Cupressocrinites sp. remains, echinoderms.  
A A wide but low columnal has an extremely opened lumen that originated due to 

interconnection of the axial and four peripheral canals. The specimen shape is 
indicative of a distal internodal. The obliteration of the articular facet was caused 
by recrystallization of the calcite-filled skeleton tissue, as well as by recent 
corrosion/erosion of the rock surface. The porous, 1-5 mm thick, dark grey 
coloured fossils with positive relief are silicified fragments of amphiporid stems.  

B A middle sized but high crinoid columnal corresponds to a nodal from a middle part 
of the stem. Cirrus with dichotomically branched cirral canals was inserted on the 
latus. This nodal was embedded in packstone where detritus of shelly fauna, 
crinoids and corals prevail.  

C Assemblage of numerous, small cupressocrinitid and/or gasterocomids columnals, 
accompanied by less abundant Gasterocoma, together with detritus of other, mainly 
brachial crinoid parts.

D–L – Thamnopora cf. irregularis Lecompte, 1939. Tabulate coral.  The variability of the 
colony and corallite growth shapes is illustrated using eleven, relatively undeformed coral 
fragments in rock slabs.  
D The thamnoporid displays its former capability of easily overgrowing of 

damaged/attacked parts in the apical part of the branch as well as on its sides.
E A considerable irregularity in budding and arrangement of corallites is regularly 

present, and according to these relatively well preserved specimens this cannot be 
alternatively ascribed only to possible environmental extremes or effects of tectonic 
deformation.  

F–G The irregularity of budding is directly reflected by irregular shapes of the corallites 
that differ also in the number of neighbouring corallites (number of wall parts) and 
also in corallite diameters.  

H–I Also the pseudo-arching of parts of corallite walls in transverse or oblique sections 
is indicative of incongruent growth domains and layers in the skeleton of the 
colony.

J–L The terminal parts of the densely branched coralla have regularly the shapes and 
lengths which can be best described as a shape of "human thumb".

Plate 6.6 - Corals from the Cortes locality From Machado et al. 2009a. 

A–F – Heliolites cf. porosus bilsteinensis ? Iven, 1980 (? = Heliolites Typus C Hubmann, 
1991). Small bulbous and domical colony shapes prevail, both usually little protracted, as 
it is seen in their longitudinal, oblique and transverse sections (A, B and C), A and C are 
slabs, B is broken and weathered colony.
D Close views on two other weathered sections (transverse and longitudinal, left 

and right in this picture.
E–F Rare silicified areas found in the thin sectioned colonies give more contrast on the 

skeleton details, but there is also evident that the deformation locally caused 
certain breakage and secondary reduction of the coenenchyme width.

G–I – Caliapora ? cf. plagiosquamata Hladil, 1981. Tabulate coral.
G The transverse section shows regular arrangement of corallites with only slight 

rotation of corallites, so that an overall appearance is somewhere among usual 
favositid, caliaporid and alveolitid appearances. 

H The slabs are indicative of presence of pores in short distances and only 
rudimental squamulae (longitudinal sections) and some transverse sections have 
rotated, four to six walled corallites, even though they grew parallel to the growth 
of their neighbours, without any strong lateral increase of the colony. 

I Some slightly bent parts of the wall seem to be thicker than the other parts, 
resembling the "batten" structures of caliaporids.

J–M – Squameoalveolites cf. fornicatus (Schlüter, 1889). Tabulate coral. Coating and low 
domical colonies.  
J–K The bent upper walls are undoubtedly dominant, being regularly, unidirectionally 

arranged in the colony.
L The longitudinal section cutting the lateral walls with pores suggests the regular 

presence of the couples of squamula-like swellings of wall, alternating with these 
mural pores.

M An oblique section of a colony gives other evidence about presence of thick 
spines and squamula-like swellings on the corallite walls.

A–D Scoliopora denticulata denticulata (Milne-Edwards &amp;amp; Haime, 1851) cf. "alpha 
morphotype" Hladil, 1985). Tabulate coral. Small, thick-walled corallites are 
elongated to 0.5 ratio in the transverse section and tend to be sub-parallel near 
colony surface. Wall thickenning from axial to peripheral zone of the branch is 
gradual. Arrangement of pores in galleries is visible, as well as swelling of walls 
between them. Rugose corals.

E–I – Pseudamplexus ? sp.
E–F Sparite-filled calicional parts of this coral in brachiopod skeletal packstone. Slab 

and weathered rock surface (E), weathered surface (F).  
G–I The higher and not so steeply conical specimens from ostracod 

packstones/wackestones are congeneric but do not need necessarily belong to the 
same species.  

K–L Examples of two possible digonophyllids (Digonophyllinae Wedekind, 1923). 
K Cystiphylloides ? sp.; a conical (and then keg-shaped) coral specimen on 

weathered rock surface typically shows large and dish arranged, bubble shaped 
dissepiments.  

L Mesophyllum ? sp. Transverse section, weathered surface. 
M–N Other fragmentary rugose corals.   
M Calceola cf. sandalina (Linné, 1771).
N An oblique section across a calicional margin of a coral. Possibly 

Pseudodigonophyllum ? sp.

A–B – Other fragmentary rugose corals (continuation).   
A Holmophyllum ? sp. (Holmophyllum ? cf. uralicum Zhavoronkova, 1972). Well 

separated, flabellacanthine-like trabeculae are indicated on the images 
B An undeterminable rugose coral, tentatively a young specimen of Cyathopaedium

? sp. attached on a broken part of amphiporid stem. Amphiporids 
C–K – Amphipora ? cf. spissa Yavorsky, 1957.
C Some broken parts of amphiporid stems were silicified. 
D–E The stems (branches) of typical 5 mm width are locally coated by thickened 

vesicular and/or multiple-tube structures which may be compared with 
cyanobacteria and algal products Wetheredella ? sp. (sensu Kazmierczak &amp;amp; 
Kempe 1992) and Gymnocodium ? sp., respectively. Separation of these coatings 
is seen on figure E. 

F–I Four slabs illustrate that growth of such a bacteria-algal stocking can continue 
also on necrotic amphiporid tissues. 

J–K Some terminations of these stockings show features of dividing. This morphology 
must rather be ascribed to unknown temporary inhabitants of these hollows than 
to self-organizing capability of the bacteria-algal structures. Brachiopods 

L–O rachiopoda gen. et sp. indet. (Type Y).  
P–Q Small, undetermined brachiopod valves as they were leached by natural 

weathering on the rocksurfaces.   
R An accumulation of thick brachiopod shells. Different types of shell 

morphologies prevail. Presence of fragmentary Kaplex and Stringocephalus shells 
is possible, but any strong evidence for this assumption is absent.

The Porto-Tomar shear zone is an important structural domain in the context of 
the NW Iberian variscides, but also to the interpretation of the geodynamic evolution of 
the whole Variscan belt. The magnitude and chronology of the activity of this structure 
is thus vital. 

The Albergaria-a-Velha Unit constitutes one of the few opportunities to 
constrain sedimentary, metamorphic and deformation events in this context. The data 
collected suggests the presence of a cratonic area acting as a sediment source area, 
which can be tentatively identified as the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ). This sedimentary 
setting lasted from the Frasnian (Late Devonian) to the Serpukovian (Late 
Mississippian). However several questions remain unanswered: 1) what unit, or even 
what geotectonic zone, was the basement on which the Albergaria-a-Velha unit 
deposited on? ; 2) was the Porto-Tomar shear zone active and controlling 
sedimentation?  

The strong deformation does not allow the first question to be answered. The 
Arada unit would be a possible candidate, but stratigraphical contacts between the two 
where never found. If some kind of important structure, which later would become the 
Porto-Tomar dextral mega shear zone, was present, it certainly did not have the same 
magnitude and probably not the same type of activity as it had during Pennsylvanian 
times. It is plausible to assume that some kind of important structural feature was 
limiting the CIZ, controlling a shore line and possibly triggering turbidity current 
events. This structure could have evolved to the Porto-Tomar shear zone after the 
Serpukovian. The major tectono-thermal event bracketed between the Serpukovian and 
the Gzhelian can be tentatively linked to the onset of the Porto-Tomar dextral shear 
movement. 

The data collected does not support the idea that the AVU represents pull-apart 
basins (e.g. Chaminé et al., 2003; 2007). This interpretation was based on the apparent 
scattered disposition of the AVU and the possible association with the PTSZ, analogous 
to the terrestrial Pennsylvanian Buçaco basin. Although it is impossible to state that 
there was a single basin, with no sub-basins, the sedimentary and biostratigraphical 
evidences suggest a single sedimentary system. The significant tectonic activity 
invariably related to pull-apart basins would result in significantly different 
sedimentological and palynological characteristics: extensive reworking, presence of 
intraclasts, varied sediment source areas, etc.. The current spatial disposition of the 
AVU is most likely a result of its post-sedimentary evolution, certainly related with the 
movement of the PTSZ. 

 The Buçaco and Santa Susana basins have very similar tectonosedimentary 
settings. The analysis of the thermal evolution of both basins and surrounding units, 
coupled with the biostratigraphical, geological and structural evidences suggest that a 
major regional (Iberian scale) tectono-thermal event occurred sometime (or during) after 
the Viséan/Serpukovian (younger sediments of the Toca da Moura Fm. and the AVU 
respectively) and the Middle-Late Pennsylvanian (ages of the Santa Susana and Buçaco 
basins respectively). In both cases this event can be correlated with the onset of dextral 
movements of major ~N-S trending shear zones: the Santa Susana shear zone and Porto-



Machado, G. Upper Palaeozoic Stratigraphy and Palynology of OMZ, NW and SW Portugal 

325

Tomar shear zone. The pre-existence of important structures in these areas is uncertain. 
The timing of events and correlation of these N-S trending shear zones with associated 
ESE-WNW trending ones (Tomar-Córdoba and Ferreira-Ficalho) cannot be clarified 
with the present data.  

It is worth to mention that the Odivelas Limestone and correlatable marble and 
silicified limestone occurrences in the southern areas of the OMZ are affected and 
probably tectonically transported along the Ferreira-Ficalho fault and also along the 
Santa Susana shear zone, limiting the age of the movement of these structures (or part 
of it) to post-Middle Devonian times. 

The occurrence of spatially (and most likely genetically) related Middle 
Devonian volcanic intermediate rocks, iron-silica ores and reef-related limestones at the 
Covas Ruivas site (and generally for the older volcanic part of the Beja Igneous 
Complex - BIC) can be compared with other occurrences elsewhere in the European 
Variscides. The Lahn and Dill synclines in the Rheno-Hercynian zone (Germany) show 
extensive Devonian volcanic rocks mostly of submarine facies (Breitkreuz &amp;amp; Flick, 
1997; Flick et al., 2008; Nesbor et al., 1993). During the Middle Devonian several reefs 
developed in areas of volcanic islands and sea mounts (Flick et al., 2008; Königshof et 
al., 2010), recorded as reef and peri-reefal facies. Several iron ore occurrences are 
known from the same synclines (Lahn-Dill ores) (Flick et al., 1990, 2008). The 
resemblance of the petrology of these ores with the ones from the BIC is striking. The 
same type of ores is also present in the Moravian – Silesian part of the Bohemian massif 
within thick Middle Devonian volcanic successions (Václav Kachlík, pers. com.). It 
thus seems that a similar tectono-magmatic-sedimentary setting prevailed during the 
Middle Devonian in wide spread areas of what are now the European Variscides. 

Future work 
The complete thermal history of the AVU and its hydrocarbon generation 

potential can only be completely understood if further data is available. The on-shore 
and off-shore extension of the basin represented by the AVU under the Lusitanian basin 
(and other Palaeozoic units?) can be further ascertained with the examination of 1) the 
available wells and dredges of the several ODP and IODP that collected pre-Mesozoic 
rocks; 2) the available and future deep exploration wells performed by oil companies; 3) 
the available and future seismic profiles of the Lusitanian basin. 
 The thermal history of pre-Mesozoic sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks 
(be it the AVU or others) in this area can be further investigated by using apatite and 
zircon fission track analysis. This would be extremely useful to date thermal and 
geological events and determine if (and where and when) hydrocarbon generation, 
migration and accumulation occurred.

The palaeobiogeography of the Late Devonian organic-walled microplankton of 
the AVU suggests stronger affinities to the Laurussian realm, while the South 
Portuguese Zone (SPZ) ones are more comparable with a North-Gondwanan realm. It 
would be extremely interesting to obtain organic-walled microplankton assemblages 
from Upper Devonian sediments of the southern parts of the OMZ and compare them to 
the AVU, SPZ and Gondwanan and Laurussian realms assemblages. This study would 
shed light on the palaeogeography of the collisional setting supposedly occurring during 
the Devonian between the OMZ and SPZ in this area and the closure of the Rheic ocean 
in general.

The detailed study of the vitrinite reflectance along the Buçaco basin sequence 
and of available borehole samples of the Santa Susana basin will probably allow the

326

definition, even if only crudely, of geothermal gradients that prevailed during their 
deposition. This determination can have a significant impact on the interpretation of the 
tectonosedimentary setting of these basins. If these are truly pull-apart basins, high 
geothermal gradients are expected. 

The recent discovery of an ash bed-like layer in an outcrop of the Buçaco basin 
may prove to be a significant find if radiometric dating can be performed. The 
calibration of the West-European Carboniferous time scale is far from complete and the 
correlation with the globally defined stages of the Pennsylvanian (mostly based on 
Eastern Europe sections) is still in its early stages. The direct correlation between a 
radiometric date and miospore biostratigraphy would be a significant contribution for 
the desired calibration. 

Further study of the stratigraphy of the Odivelas Limestone and correlatable 
marbles and silicified limestones along with study of the petrology of the volcanic rocks 
and iron ores surrounding the limestones will allow a better understanding of processes 
that originated these rocks and why they occur together. This is vital to understand the 
possible connections with other geotectonic zones elsewhere in Europe.
