Abstract

The risks in the evaluation of mining projects are directly related to the prob-
ability of errors in the estimates, and, as the estimates are based on sampling results, 
this activity must be performed in a careful and planned way, to prevent surprises at 
the beginning of operation. To validate the representativeness of the borehole samples 
selected for the mineral processing studies, the geological resources evaluation team 
proposed a methodology based on the utilization of statistical analyses that, beyond 
considering the spatial distribution of the samples in the deposit, also assessed if they 
are representative of the populations under investigation. With this data, the geologist 
is able to make a fast analysis of the sampling’s representativeness.

Resumo

Os riscos na avaliação de projetos mineiros estão diretamente relacionados à 
probabilidade das estimativas falharem e, como as estimativas são realizadas a partir 
de resultados de amostragens, essa atividade deve ser realizada de forma criteriosa 
e planejada, para se evitararem surpresas no início da operação dos projetos. Para 
validar a representatividade de amostras de furos de sonda selecionadas para estudos 
de processamento mineral, a equipe de geologia de avaliação de recursos propôs uma 
metodologia baseada na utilização de ferramentas de análise estatística, que além, 
de considerar a distribuição espacial dessas amostras, no depósito, analisa se elas são 
representativas das populações estudadas, permitindo ao geólogo fazer uma análise 
rápida da representatividade amostral.

1. Introduction

Sampling is a sequence of operations 
performed with the objective of removing 
a representative part of its surroundings, 
called primary or global sampling. This 
process is necessary throughout the life 
of a mining venture. Its use in mining 
begins with the preliminary steps of geo-

logical exploration, and continues for the 
resource reserves evaluation phase, mine 
planning, mine and power plant opera-
tion, laboratorial quality control, tailings 
level control, final product qualification, 
contaminant monitoring of the burden 
pile, springs, dams and finally, mine clo-

sure monitoring. At all stages, representa-
tive samples are fetched that serve as the 
basis for specific studies in various areas. 
The big challenge is to collect the so-called 
"representative sample".

Agricola (1556) has already said 
that "a mining company that is ignorant

and inexperienced in the art of mining, 
digs a mineral occurrence without care-
ful discrimination, while one that has 
experience and knowledge, first acquires 
samples and proves the mineral’s exis-
tence, and when very narrow / wide and 
solid veins are found, works only those 
that will produce economic returns.” 

A sampling theory proposed by 
Pierre Gy (1955), tackles the issue of 
sampling representativeness. According to 
Gy, there is no way of knowing whether 
a particular sample is representative of 
its surrounding by only using sampling 
process surveillance or characterization 
of the sample itself. A sampling procedure 
done with quality is able to recognize the 
samples as being representative of the 
situation.

The sub or super sizing of equipment 
projected for usage in a power plant is a 
very common mistake and inadequate 
sampling can be its cause. Studies done 
for this purpose are usually conducted 
from samples of evenly-spaced boreholes, 
whose mass is little representative of the 
total ore deposit (resource or reserve). 
Many projects are designed based on 
insufficient information, and can generate 
high equipment adaptation costs because 
the equipment proved to be inappropriate 
for the type of deposit.

The risks in the evaluation of mining 
projects are directly related to the prob-
ability of errors in the estimates. . As the 
estimates are taken from the sampling 
results, this activity should be judicious 
and well-planned, to avoid surprises at the 
beginning of the operation of the projects.

This type of surprise is common 
in the mineral sector. Burmeister (1989) 
examined 35 Australian gold mine op-
erations initiated in the period between 
1984 and 1987 and found that 23 of 
them did not reach the expected produc-
tion in the first year of operation. Those 
that exceeded their production goals an-
ticipated improvements in the processing 
plants. Only two of the 35 reached the 
projected content recovery; those that 
didn’t noted that the reasons for the differ-
ences between planning and production 
levels included excessive dilution, inap-
propriate estimative planning techniques, 
inappropriate geological interpretation, 
questionable chemical analysis and insuf-
ficient probing. 

Clow (1991) examined 25 advanced 
gold projects in Canada and found that 
only three had achieved their expecta-
tions. For the author, the main reason for 
the failures was incorrect resource estima-
tion due to factors mentioned below:

i. poor data management;

ii. inappropriate treatment of high 
level values (outliers);

iii absence of large-volume samples;
iv. geostatistical application errors; 

and
v. inadequate assessment of the dilu-

tion and mining methods.
Another similar example was the 

study by Harquail (1991) about North 
American gold mines. It detected 39 types 
of design flaws, 20 of which were due to 
aspects related to reserve assessments, 
including basic sampling errors and lack 
of mining knowledge. He noted that most 
of the failures occurred mainly because 
the expected production levels were not 
achieved and/or the inadequate process-
ing methods used for ore-poor mining 
generated high operational costs. Other 
authors attributed the unexpected results 
of mining projects to inexperience in 
mine development, and the deficiency of 
geology studies and financial engineering 
that support production decisions (Vallee 
et al., 1992).

Most of the problems identified by 
these authors are related to the estima-
tion of Mineral resources and reserves, 
which is obtained from sample data. It 
can be concluded that a poorly projected 
estimate of resources and reserves can 
lead to serious economic consequences.

2. The sampling theory of Gy and sampling representativeness

Sampling is a complex selection 
process. According to Gy (1976), a 
selection process can be characterized 
in terms of a priori and a posteriori 
qualities.

A priori qualities meet the follow-
ing conditions:

The selection process is said to be:
- “probabilistic” - when each ele-

ment of the batch has the probability of 
being selected.

- “non-probabilistic” - if the batch 
elements do not meet the “probabilistic” 
condition. For example, the selection 
method of selection that uses a hammer 
and shovel is based on a pre-defined 
selection of material and is a non-
probabilistic method. These methods 
are generally very biased and must be 
rejected since they do not permit a theo-
retical approach.

-“correct” - when all elements in the 

batch are subjected to selection, and have 
an equal probability of being selected.

- “incorrect” - when it does not 
meet the condition of equal probability.

A posteriori qualities are based 
on the results of the selection and more 
specifically on the statistical properties 
of the selection error e in relationship 
with the difference between the critical 
content a

E
 of sample E and the critical 

content a
L
 of the batch sample lot L:

e = (a
E
 - a

L
) / a

L

The selection process is said to be: “unbiased” - when the average m  check error is nil:

m (e) = 0 ? m (a
E
) = a

L

(1)

(2)

“biased” or “skewed” - when the average error is not null. The average value is the bias B or systematic relative error:

B = m (e ) ? 0 ? m (a
E
) ? a

L
(3)

“reproducible” - when the selection’s er- ror variance is not greater than the given "reproducibility standard deviation ?2
0
:

?2(e) ? ?2
0

“accurate” - when the mean and varian- ce of the error of selection is always null: 

“needed” - when at the same time it is reproducible and unbiased: 

“representative” - when the mean 
square of the error does not exceed the 

standard deviation of representativeness

In practice, the only a posteriori 
quality feature that can be achieved 
is the “representative”. Precision and 

accuracy are achieved only at the limit. 
The theory of sampling can also be con-
sidered as the search for relationships 

between the conditions and the results 
of a sampling, i.e. between its qualities 
a priori and a posteriori.

3. Sampling in iron ore projects

Various types of sampling for differ-
ent purposes make up the database used 
by mining companies. The database used 
in the evaluation of geological reserves 
and resources in the study of mineral 
processing (grinding, sieving, flotation, 
gravimetrics, magnetic separation, etc.) 
is formed usually from probing samples 
and represents the main group of samples 
that impacts on decision-making of the 
companies in the mineral sector.

Big mining companies use the large 
diameter probe to collect samples in bulk 
for processing trials and metallurgical 
tests. Sometimes it is difficult to perform 
this type of sampling because of the dif-
ficulty in allocating qualified companies 
and low equipment availability.

Another large-volume sampling 
practice adopted is the opening of small 

pits or galleries for experimental workings 
and ore treatment on a pilot scale. In this 
case, the environmental constraints have 
been a major problem for the collection 
of samples with representative volumes.

Direct access to the mineral body is 
given by outcrops, galleries, research wells 
and boreholes. Each of these "fronts" of 
research carries factors affecting the rep-
resentativeness of the samples, mainly due 
to the collection methods that permit sam-
pling in different volumetric brackets. In 
the case of boreholes, the small mass of the 
samples provides the information almost 
immediately. Factors related to sample 
mass, probing recovery, nugget effect, rock 
density, contents and granulometry can 
generate possible errors, which in turn, 
depend on sampling support. 

At Vale, a large Brazilian mining 

company, the main means of collecting 
large volume samples are galleries, re-
search wells and samples taken at the min-
ing front. Boreholed samples have already 
been used for several mineral processing 
studies and the evaluation of resources and 
reserves. Other types of sampling results 
are also stored in the database at Vale: 
handheld, for qualitative assessment of the 
levels of rocks on the surface; boreholes 
(or reverse circulation diamond); channel 
samples; etc.

Samples are used in various types of 
studies, among which the following stand 
out: density; granulometric and chemical 
variability; mineralogical characteriza-
tion; technological characterization; 
pilot tests for definition of process routes; 
simulation of operational parameters for 
the plant; thickening tests; etc.

4. Selection Methodology of borehole samples for mineral processing studies

Technological characterization 
studies of ore types are very important 
in the development of new projects, ex-
pansion projects, and definition of plant 
and route process suitability. The results 
obtained are also used in equipment siz-
ing and other operational parameters, 
prediction of ore behavior in the mill, 
mass balance, tailings characterization, 
ROM degradation studies, and product 
predictability, among others.

Until mid-2009, there was no de-
fined methodology for the selection of 
samples. Each sampling was performed 
empirically with criteria depending on the 
study’s objectives. Its analyses observed 
only if the average of the population levels 
were close to the average of the selected 
samples considered to be the historical 

population average (previous samples), 
in an attempt to find a parallelism be-
tween the proportions of each lithotype 
in relationship with the resources or re-
serves in order to determine the number 
of specimens to be collected. Also, there 
was no check performed between the 
selected samples and the surroundings 
from which they were extracted. To try 
to minimize possible errors in the defini-
tion of projects for power plants caused 
by inadequate or poorly representative 
sampling, a methodology is proposed, 
based on the use of analytic statistical 
procedures such as histograms and QQ-
Plot (quantile-quantile plot) graphs for the 
validation of the sample selection.

The histogram represents a prob-
ability distribution function (fdp) dis-

cretized from a particular variable. If this 
function is representative, the occurrence 
frequency data can be measured as a func-
tion of the class interval variable itself, for 
certain volumetric support. These func-
tions can be represented by accumulated 
frequencies associated with cut-off values 
(fdpc, cumulative histograms). In the case 
of iron ore, for example, the frequency 
curve of the data registering iron levels 
above various cut-off levels is called the 
parameterizing curve and serves to quan-
tify the resource or reserve for a given 
volumetric support (sample, block, etc).

As a sample of this process, consider 
the parameterization curve calculated 
with all samples as being representative 
of the deposit (total curve). This curve is 
made for each specific lithological group

taking into consideration the effects of 
the spatial groupings of the samples and 
techniques applied for ungrouping. The 
subset of samples collected for the char-
acterization process should have a param-
eterization curve that represents the full 
curve and thus the curve for a particular 
lithological group in the deposit. For each 
percentile calculated by the total curve, 
there is a cut-off value. Similarly, for the 
curve representing the sampling process, 
there should be cut-off values associated 
with the aforementioned percentiles. With 
this data, a chart comparing the cut-off 
values of the two curves, associated to 
the same percentiles can be assembled 
and plotted in in a scatterplot (QQ-Plot). 
If the two curves are similar, the cut-off 
values in the same percentile should be 

close and the scatter plot points should 
approximate a straight line identity with 
the bisect passing through the origin with 
an angular coefficient of 1.

 This technique is often used to 
compare types of experimental theoretical 
probability distribution (Gaussian distri-
bution, for example).

The proposed methodology follows 
the following scheme:

1) a sampling request is made by the 
area responsible for processing, including 
studies with quality specifications and 
types to be sampled;

2) selection is made by a geological 
team from the probing database, taking 
into consideration the spatial distribution 
of samples throughout the mine pit, as 
well as their representativeness in relation 

to the geological reserve resources; 
3) representativeness of the samples 

is validated in relation to required qual-
ity and is performed using statistical 
analysis tools;

4) a list of samples selected for 
the location and subsequent collection 
is submitted;

5) specimens are sent to mineral 
processing.

The following are two examples 
of application of the methodology. The 
first example was to check the sampling 
performed for variability studies at the 
Brucutu Mine in 2007. At that time the 
methodology in question did not exist.

When applying the methodology 
using statistical analysis tools for vali-
dation of the sampling’s representative-
ness, it was possible to conclude in the 
first analysis that the sampling was not 
representative because it represented 

only the average of expected levels, 
disregarding variability. The histograms 
in Figure 02 shows the differences be-
tween the historical sample and samples 
selected. In histogram (a), it is possible 
to observe a bimodal distribution, while 

in histogram (b) there is a population 
with a tendency towards normal dis-
tribution. The QQ-Plot (c) highlights 
the discrepancy between the levels of 
selected samples and the expected levels, 
represented by a straight-line identity.

5. Conclusions

In the two previous examples it 
was possible to observe that the mere 
use of statistical analysis tools such as 
histograms and QQ-plotting permitted 
the rapid analysis of the sampling rep-
resentativeness of the samples selected 
for the testing of technological charac-
terization.

The use of the methodology has 
brought quality gains for sampling and 
allowed the geologist to assess whether 
the selected samples represented or not the 
sampling universe of the ores to be studied.

For cases of samples with very ir-
regular meshes, techniques for spatial data 
construction for ungrouping the QQ-Plots 

and histograms must be applied.
The sampling selection technique 

presented herein has validated the use 
of stochastic or probability analysis for 
metallurgical/technological results of 
the sampling process, opening up new 
possibilities for risk assessment in the 
mineral projects of a company.
