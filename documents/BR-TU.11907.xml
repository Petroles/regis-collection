Agradecimentos 

 Tal como em qualquer outro desafio na vida, o balanço entre o sucesso e o insucesso depende 

não só nas nossas próprias capacidades, mas também no apoio de todas aquelas pessoas que se unem a 

nós, em trabalho e em amizade, e que de alguma forma nos auxiliam a superar os obstáculos. São muitos, 

aqueles a quem sinto que devo agradecer por me terem ajudado a alcançar este novo e pequeno passo 

em direcção àquele que é o sonho de uma vida. Espero poder fazer a todos um pouco de justiça, e que 

revejam nestas palavras a gratidão que sinto, e que espero conseguir demonstrar um pouco no dia-a-dia.  

 Aos meus orientadores, Tiago e Rui, quero expressar-vos antes de tudo um enorme Obrigado, 

por me terem aceitado como vosso estudante sem vacilar, por desde o início acreditarem no meu 

potencial e me guiarem até ao fim nesta jornada que ditará, assim espero, o início da minha vida 

científica. Ao Eduardo e à Cátia, muito obrigado por toda a ajuda, pela dedicação permanente àquele 

que se tornou o nosso projecto, por aturarem os meus desesperos e por puxarem por mim quando mais 

precisei. Obrigado também à restante equipa do RRlab e do Laboratório Marítimo da Guia, pela ajuda 

nas amostragens longas e penosas, pelos conselhos e dicas, pelas boleias intermináveis desde Lisboa, e 

pela companhia e companheirismo e por essencialmente me fazerem sentir incluído na vossa “família”.  

 Obrigado à Doutora Patrícia Cardoso, do CIIMAR - Porto, por tão gentilmente ter cedido parte 

da população original dos organismos necessários para a minha dissertação. A todos os Professores e 

Professoras da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, aqueles que provavelmente já se 

esqueceram do meu nome ou até da minha cara, dos tempos longínquos da licenciatura, e aqueles com 

quem ainda hoje troco um cumprimento, uma piada ou uma ideia, agradeço o enorme e tão importante 

contributo que deram para a minha educação científica.  

 Num tom mais pessoal, quero agradecer à rapariga que tomou o meu coração de assalto, amor 

da minha vida e a minha melhor amiga, pelo apoio incondicional e a ajuda que me prestou. Obrigado, 

Nádia, por me teres feito acreditar em mim próprio quando por vezes vacilei. Por teres tido a paciência 

e o carinho de me aturar durante um ano em que a conversa muitas vezes ia parar à «comida de 

tartaruga». Por toda a ajuda que me deste, tanto directamente na dissertação: a triar alguns dos 

organismos e a cuidar dos sistemas, a paciência enorme em me teres ajudado a completar a base de 

dados de parâmetros físico-químicos (só tu para aceitares ajudar num trabalho chato como esse); mas 

também nas noites longas de escrita em que foste a minha companhia e a minha força. Obrigado, meu 

amor! 

 Para a minha família, o meu pai e o meu irmão, vocês sempre me apoiaram. Obrigado por 

sempre me dizerem: vai em frente, faz o que te fizer feliz. Obrigado! Aos meus amigos e eternos 

companheiros de longa e curta data. Mais do que aqueles que poderia enumerar aqui e saber que não 

ficou ninguém de fora: um muito obrigado por me aturarem e apoiarem a cada novo dia. Espero 

encontrar-vos outra vez em breve e beber umas cervejas para vos contar como correu a defesa! 

 Não queria deixar de expressar, também, não um agradecimento, mas um pensamento de 

compaixão em particular. Em experimentação com animais, vemos passar dezenas, senão centenas de 

vidas – mais ou menos complexas – pelas nossas mãos. Aquilo que para muitos pode ser apenas trivial, 

mais um indivíduo amostrado no meio de muitos, é para os animais decisivo. Assim, a todos os pequenos 

seres que tornaram esta tese possível, espero ter-vos tratado a cada dia com o respeito merecido e não 

ter causado sofrimento desnecessário ou cruel. Nas palavras de Dalai Lama: «Life is just as dear to a 

mute creature as it is to man. Just as one wants happiness and fears pain, just as one wants to live and 

not die, so do other creatures».

Abstract 

  

 Ocean acidification (OA) poses a global threat to marine biodiversity. The rise in atmospheric 

carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, resulting from anthropogenic activities, is responsible for the 

increase in the dissolved state of this gas in the oceans. The consequent changes in pH and seawater 

carbonate chemistry are responsible for the disruption of several biological processes (e.g. impairing 

survival and the maintenance of fitness-enhancing, physiological and behavioural, mechanisms) in 

certain marine groups. Disruption at the individual level, can originate negative cascading effects at 

higher levels of biological organization (i.e. populations and communities), which in turn can alter the 

underlying dynamics that control an ecosystem’s structure and overall function. Current theories suggest 

that marine organisms might be able to maintain their performance in future OA conditions, either 

through acclimation or through evolutionary adaptation. Surprisingly, the effects of prolonged high-CO2 

exposure in crustaceans are still poorly known. The present dissertation investigates, for the first time, 

the transgenerational effects (i.e. over two generations) of ocean acidification in the physiology, 

behaviour (e.g. male mate-attraction) and reproductive traits (e.g. female investment, fecundity, mate-

guarding and embryonic development) of the gammarid amphipod Gammarus locusta. Significant 

effects of ocean acidification were found for most reproductive traits. Although OA may initially 

stimulate female investment, transgenerational exposure led to an overall reduction in egg number and 

fecundity. The duration of mate-guarding behaviours was also diminished under high-CO2 exposure. 

Individuals from the second generation (F1) exhibited metabolic depression (i.e. reduced oxygen 

consumption rates), and males also displayed a reduced ability to accurately identify and track the origin 

of female scent cues, thus hinting at a possible disruption of chemosensory abilities. Overall, negative 

transgenerational (i.e. parental) effects were observed for all reproductive traits, as well as survival, in 

the acidified lineage. The present findings suggest that exposure to a future ocean acidification scenario 

will likely lead to a reduction in the fitness of the natural populations of G. locusta.

Resumo 

  

 O ambiente marinho encontra-se sob ameaça das alterações climáticas. A acidificação dos 

oceanos, assim como o aumento da temperatura média das águas, constitui um risco global à 

biodiversidade marinha. O aumento significativo da concentração de dióxido de carbono (CO2) na 

atmosfera, resultante das atividades humanas e experienciado desde o início da Revolução Industrial, 

tem vindo a provocar grandes alterações na química dos oceanos, num processo que pode ser designado 

por hipercapnia, i.e., o aumento das concentrações de CO2 nas águas, com o potencial para alterar 

significativamente muitos dos processos biológicos necessários à manutenção da saúde e equilíbrio dos 

ecossistemas. Ainda que inicialmente identificada como uma ameaça para organismos considerados 

mais suscetíveis (e.g. invertebrados calcificadores), a acidificação dos oceanos e, consequentemente, a 

hipercapnia, tem vindo a ser reconhecida como um potencial risco à sobrevivência e à manutenção dos 

mecanismos fisiológicos e comportamentais que são fulcrais à otimização do fitness dos organismos 

marinhos, e para o equilíbrio das populações naturais de inúmeros organismos marinhos. Tais efeitos 

irão levar, inevitavelmente, a repercussões tanto ao nível das comunidades, como à alteração da 

dinâmica que controla a estrutura e o equilíbrio dos ecossistemas naturais.   

 Quando o CO2 entra no corpo dos indivíduos, por difusão, tende a equilibrar-se rapidamente em 

todos os compartimentos corporais, tendo um efeito predominantemente acidificante capaz de perturbar 

significativamente o equilíbrio ácido-base interno de um indivíduo. Desta forma, o CO2 poderá levar a 

mudanças que irão afectar as taxas metabólicas e a alocação natural de energia entre os vários processos 

corporais do organismo. Embora os seres vivos marinhos possuam, no geral, mecanismos que permitem 

ajustar o organismo à hipercapnia, estes poderão não ser suficientes para exposições de longo prazo a 

determinados níveis de stress prolongado, e ter como consequência o comprometimento da 

sobrevivência, do metabolismo e do crescimento dos indivíduos, mas também da sua reprodução e do 

comportamento. Estima-se que as espécies iono- ou osmorreguladoras serão, em princípio, mais 

tolerantes aos níveis futuros de acidificação dos oceanos, uma vez que possuem os mecanismos 

compensatórios adequados que lhes permitem responder a perturbações externas ao equilíbrio ácido-

base. Tipicamente, estas espécies habitam ambientes costeiros pouco profundos e sob influência de 

fontes de água doce, onde estão expostas a variações naturais e por vezes abruptas dos parâmetros 

abióticos – como o pH, salinidade, temperatura, etc.  

 Os crustáceos são considerados um grupo bastante resiliente e capaz de se adaptar às condições 

do oceano de amanhã. Durante a última década, tem-se verificado um aumento no interesse do estudo 

dos efeitos da acidificação nos crustáceos intertidais. Estes organismos desempenham um papel crucial 

nas cadeias tróficas, sendo não só consumidores primários e secundários de grande relevância, bem 

como servindo de alimento para níveis tróficos superiores – e.g. peixes, aves marinhas e limícolas, etc. 

São também caracterizados por uma elevada variedade de respostas a mudanças ambientais, desde 

regulação ativa face a alterações abióticas externas, a conformação às novas condições, etc. A maioria 

dos crustáceos são também espécies em contato direto com o meio envolvente, através de estruturas 

especializadas (como brânquias ou outras estruturas equivalentes), que são responsáveis por trocas de 

gás e de iões. Apesar de mais tolerantes à hipercapnia, o ajuste do equilíbrio ácido-base dos crustáceos 

deverá ter elevados custos metabólicos, pelo que a exposição prolongada a um ambiente ácido, dentro 

dos intervalos de projeção para o final do século, poderá afectar negativamente estas espécies.  

 Para a maioria dos organismos marinhos, e particularmente no grupo dos crustáceos, os efeitos 

de uma exposição prolongada e por várias gerações a concentrações elevadas de CO2 no meio marinho 

são ainda relativamente desconhecidos. Os organismos poderão ser capazes de manter a sua performance 

nas condições futuras dos oceanos, quer através de aclimatação, quer através de adaptação evolutiva. A 

aclimatação supõe a existência de plasticidade fenotípica no que diz respeito às respostas fisiológicas, 



  VII 

morfológicas ou comportamentais, que auxiliam na manutenção do fitness dos indivíduos num novo 

ambiente. Por sua vez, a adaptação consiste na retenção nas populações por seleção natural dos 

genótipos favoráveis a um novo ambiente e que leva à alteração da estrutura natural das populações ao 

dirigir o equilíbrio fenotípico para um novo nível óptimo em relação às condições encontradas.  

 A aclimatação transgeracional ocorre quando um novo ambiente experienciado por uma geração 

paternal, influencia positivamente a performance da sua descendência para esse mesmo ambiente. Por 

vezes, é necessária uma exposição de várias gerações a um determinado factor de stress até que surjam 

diferenças significativas nas características de uma espécie entre dois ambientes diferentes. Assim, de 

modo a estudar a forma como a acidificação dos oceanos poderá ou não afectar os organismos no oceano 

de amanhã, são necessários estudos trans- e multigeracionais, que abordem esta questão em espécies 

com ciclos de vida curtos e de fácil manutenção.  

 O presente estudo visou aumentar o conhecimento existente acerca dos efeitos transgeracionais 

e da possível adaptação dos organismos marinhos à acidificação futura dos oceanos, no que diz respeito 

à fisiologia e aos processos reprodutivos de anfípodes gamarídeos. Neste sentido, foram estabelecidas 

duas populações laboratoriais de Gammarus locusta, que foram sujeitas por duas gerações consecutivas 

a um cenário de acidificação com valores estimados para o final do século (pH= 7.7 e pCO2 = 900 ?atm) 

e a um cenário controlo com valores de pH e pressão parcial de CO2 actuais (pH = 8.1, pCO2 = 400 

?atm). Em ambas as gerações, foram recolhidos dados relativos a características específicas da história 

de vida desta espécie: i) investimento reprodutor das fêmeas (número médio de ovos no interior do 

marsúpio das fêmeas); ii) duração da parelha reprodutora (mate-guarding), iii) fecundidade média; iv) 

tempo médio de desenvolvimento embrionário; v) e apenas para a segunda geração, testes 

comportamentais focados na atração de machos por pistas olfativas de fêmeas recetivas, e do consumo 

médio de oxigénio (taxa metabólica de rotina). Os resultados do presente estudo mostraram efeitos 

significativos da acidificação dos oceanos na maioria das características reprodutivas desta espécie. 

Apesar de uma descida no pH poder, numa primeira instância e para a primeira geração exposta, 

estimular positivamente o investimento reprodutor das fêmeas, uma exposição transgeracional leva a 

uma redução significativa do número de ovos e da fecundidade. A duração da parelha reprodutora 

também foi significativamente afectada, tendo diminuído para os casais expostos ao ambiente 

acidificado, contudo não foram encontrados efeitos ao nível da duração do desenvolvimento 

embrionário. A sobrevivência aos 30 dias de idade foi também significativamente afectada, tendo 

diminuído em cerca de 19% em relação à população controlo e sugerindo a existência de efeitos 

metabólicos nefastos. Na segunda geração, foi identificada a presença de depressão metabólica em 

organismos de ambos os sexos, assim como uma perda da acuidade na localização da origem de pistas 

reprodutoras de fêmeas, aliada ao aumento do tempo de resposta (o estimular de comportamentos 

locomotores de busca) em machos sujeitos a condições de acidificação.  

 No geral, e para as características reprodutivas afectadas, assim como para a sobrevivência, 

foram encontrados efeitos transgeracionais (parentais) negativos na linhagem acidificada, que sugerem 

a possível diminuição do fitness das populações naturais de G. locusta num cenário de acidificação 

futura dos oceanos. Os efeitos da acidificação ao nível do metabolismo, aliados à depressão metabólica 

observada na segunda geração, ajudam a explicar a maioria dos resultados obtidos e sugerem a existência 

de efeitos nefastos da diminuição do pH (e aumento do pCO2) numa espécie tipicamente considerada 

como resiliente.

1. Introduction 
 

 

 

 

 1.1. Ocean acidification  
 

 Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid-eighteenth century, the world has 

witnessed geochemical changes that have not been experienced for the last 300 million years (Hönisch 

et al., 2012). The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere by agricultural, industrial, 

deforestation and transportation activities, is a serious concern. Current estimates set concentrations of 

this greenhouse gas higher than they have been for over 800 thousands years, while giving no hint to a 

possible decrease in the build-up rates (Lüthi et al., 2008). It is expected that the actual rate of 

atmospheric CO2 build up will increase in the following years (IPCC, 2014), with concentrations 

displaying an escalating trend from 280 ?atm (micro atmospheres, pre-industrial) to approximately 400 

?atm (current levels) (Feely et al., 2009, Hönisch et al., 2012, IPCC, 2014).  

 CO2 is one of the most relevant gases in our planet’s atmosphere, being responsible for the 

control of both radiative heat balance of the Earth, and the calcium carbonate equilibrium in the oceans 

as well (Petit et al., 1999). CO2 levels both in the air and in surface waters tend to equilibrate – in 

accordance with Henry’s Law; as atmospheric partial pressures for this gas increase, leading to the 

equivalent dissolution of CO2 (Pörtner et al., 2004). The ocean’s carbonate chemistry is governed by a 

series of abiotic and biologically mediated chemical reactions (see Figure 1.1.1a), which depend on the 

stability of abiotic parameters such as ocean temperature and alkalinity. It is the flux of carbon dioxide 

between the atmosphere and the ocean - which is a function of surface mixing and differences in 

concentration between surface waters and the air – that keeps the ocean’s carbon chemistry in check, 

and maintains a positive environment for current ecological processes, as well as the survival and 

maintenance of fitness-enhancing, physiological and behavioural mechanisms in marine organisms 

(Feely et al., 2009, Munday et al., 2013, Sunday et al., 2014).  

 Ocean acidification results from the abnormal increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide 

(pCO2) in surface waters, which in turn leads to the reduction in mean surface water pH levels (Sunday 

et al., 2014). The increase in pCO2 is associated with the increased uptake of fossil fuel-derived CO2 

from the atmosphere (Orr et al., 2005, Feely et al., 2009, Sunday et al., 2014), which in turn leads to the 

unbalancing of normal seawater carbonate chemistry. As pCO2 increases in seawater, there is a 

subsequent increase in the rate of the reactions that form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Most of this acid 

naturally dissociates to form HCO3
- and H+, and the latter reacts in turn with carbonate ions to produce 

additional bicarbonate ions (see Figure 1.1.1b). This shift in the carbon chemistry, by “injecting” 

increased quantities of carbon dioxide into the ocean, contributes to the progressive acidification of 

seawater, with an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, the associated decline in pH levels, and the 

reduction in the concentration of free carbonate ions (Feely et al., 2009), as well as the saturation state 

of calcium carbonate minerals.

 This increase in the ocean’s acidity has gradually occurring, translated in a decrease of 

approximately 0.1 pH units since the beginning of the industrial era (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003, Orr et 

al., 2005, Doney et al., 2009). The majority of OA projections place a future increase of pCO2 from 

current levels (~400 ?atm), to approximately 880-990 ppm by the year 2100 (see Figure 1.1.2). This 

would mean an additional decrease of 0.3 pH units coupled with an increase in the ocean’s hydrogen 

ion concentration of approximately 2.5 times, relative to pre-industrial levels (Caldeira and Wickett, 

2003, Friedlingstein and Solomon, 2005, IPCC, 2014), which could pose a serious risk for marine 

organisms in the near future, as will be discussed in the next section.

 1.1.1 Effects of OA on crustaceans and other marine organisms 

 

 General concern about the severe impacts of OA in marine organisms has increased over the 

past decades (Orr et al., 2005, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2007, Kroeker et al., 2010, Sunday et al., 2014). 

Changes in ocean chemistry associated with OA will elicit both direct and indirect effects in the 

physiological functioning, behaviour and demographic traits of most marine organisms. These effects 

will translate into populational and community level changes - which can ultimately alter the underlying 

dynamics that control an ecosystem’s structure and overall function (Doney et al., 2012) – and 

acidification could, therefore, have major impacts on food webs and global geochemical cycles (Orr et 

al., 2005, Doney et al., 2009, Feely et al., 2009, Doney et al., 2012).  

 It is generally accepted that the degree to which a particular species will be affected by projected 

OA will ultimately depend on its physiological performance. When faced with a stressor, organisms 

initially respond with physiological and behavioural adaptations, which are conditioned by their 

evolutionary history (Doney et al., 2012, Somero, 2012). If conditions are physiologically tolerable, 

individuals of said species can acclimate or adjust their physiology to cope with the new stressor. As 

acclimation at an individual level occurs, then a species may also (but not necessarily) adapt to the new 

conditions on the long-term - by increasing both the abundance and the reproductive success of those 

genotypes that are most tolerant to the new conditions - over subsequent generations (Doney et al., 2012, 

Munday et al., 2013). If, on the contrary, these conditions prove to be physiologically unfavourable, 

individuals and populations will either promote migration into areas where conditions are more suitable, 

induce changes in phenology and advance or delay certain life-history events, or even face local 

extinction events (Parmesan, 2006).  

 Depending on species ability to acclimate or adapt to OA, some taxa have been classified as 

being potentially more vulnerable than others (Whiteley, 2011, Doney et al., 2012). Invertebrates such 

as cnidarians, molluscs and echinoderms have been extensively studied for their well-known 

vulnerability to changes in the ocean’s chemistry – for being poor iono-regulators and having a reduced 

ability to buffer the acidifying effects of high-CO2 concentrations in their body compartments (Fabry et 

al., 2008, Doney et al., 2009, Dupont et al., 2010). For these and other groups, OA is known to affect 

many physiological processes and life-history patterns: in calcifying organisms, OA is thought to 

increase the energy costs of calcification (Pörtner et al., 2004, Hofmann et al., 2010, Doney et al., 2012), 

and some species have been known to undergo dissolution of their calcified skeletons or suffer 

significant reductions in their calcification rates, when exposed to acidic environments (Fabry et al., 

2008, Whiteley, 2011). Reproduction and metabolism can also be affected, and some species have 

shown reduced fertilization success, shorter developmental rates and larval sizes (Kurihara, 2008), and 

lower oxygen-binding capacity (O2) of respiratory proteins - thus impairing an individual’s aerobic 

scope (Pörtner et al., 2004).   

 The effects of OA in marine organisms result from the entry of CO2 by diffusion in the individual 

body, rapidly achieving equilibrium in all body compartments, which then has a predominantly 

acidifying effect on an individual’s internal acid-base balance (Pörtner et al., 2004). By causing changes 

in one or in a combination of the body compartment’s acid-base parameters, CO2 may affect overall 

metabolic rates, as well as the partitioning of energy between individual metabolic processes (Pörtner 

et al., 2004). Disturbances in the acid-base balance can frequently be compensated in order to re-



4 

 

establish the original or a new equilibrium in the body fluids, and for this purpose, water breathers rely 

almost exclusively on ion exchange mechanisms with the exterior.  

 Changes in the ocean’s and the individual’s carbonate chemistry compromise the excretion of 

CO2 from the haemolymph, leading to increases in its concentration in the extracellular compartment 

and to variations in the haemolymph’s pH levels (Whiteley, 2011). The resulting variation of pH levels 

in haemolymph can be buffered by adjusting the body’s acid-base equilibria, maintaining an 

environment favourable with most protein activity. Rises in intracellular H+ can, however, disrupt 

protein synthesis, iono-regulation, cell volume and overall metabolism. This interferes with organism’s 

capacity to cope with pH disruptions in the haemolymph, as they can only be tolerated to some extent, 

before causing medium to long term disturbances (Whiteley, 2011). Acid-base balance disruptions both 

in extra- and intracellular environments can have far-reaching consequences, compromising survival 

and disrupting relevant biological processes such as metabolism and individual growth. Species that are 

strong iono- and osmoregulators, are likely to be most tolerant to OA, because they own the 

compensatory mechanisms that enable them to respond to acid-base disruptions. These species typically 

inhabit shallow coastal environments, under freshwater influence, where they experience natural 

variations in abiotic parameters – i.e. seawater pCO2, pO2, salinity and temperature (Pörtner et al., 2004, 

Whiteley, 2011, Kelly and Hofmann, 2013).  

 Crustacea have thus been considered a fairly resilient group of species, capable of adjusting to 

future OA conditions. However, in the past decade, a growing interest on how OA will directly affect 

these intertidal dwellers has shed some light on the subject. Crustaceans are primary and secondary 

consumers, and constitute an important food source for higher trophic levels. As abundant and frequent 

living organisms of intertidal and estuarine areas, which are known to display broad and rapidly 

changing fluctuations of physical factors (Whiteley, 2011), crustaceans also show a wide variety of 

responses to abiotic change – from active regulation against external changes, to conformation to new 

conditions. 

 The majority of crustacean species are committed water-breathers, in which there is close 

contact with the external environment through specialized structures – i.e. gills or others equivalent – 

that are responsible for respiratory gas and ion exchange (Taylor and Taylor, 1992). Despite being more 

tolerant to hypercapnia - because they maintain higher HCO3
- concentration in the haemolymph - acid-

base adjustments made by crustaceans are likely to be metabolically expensive if exposure to acidified 

conditions is prolonged over weeks or months, due to the dependence on bicarbonate (HCO3
-) ion uptake 

from the seawater (Whiteley, 2011). If these compensation costs are indeed significant, then it is possible 

to infer that crustaceans could be adversely affected by OA, and that the costs will either be limiting and 

restrict homeostatic processes, or energy will be diverted away from other processes, with individual 

performance being affected in both scenarios (Pörtner et al., 2004, Whiteley, 2011).  

 There is indeed growing evidence that OA may affect crustacean populations by influencing 

growth and / or reproductive performance in adults, and in determining life-history traits such as larval 

development and settling (Whiteley, 2011). Some described effects of short-term exposure to high-CO2 

in crustaceans include changes in egg production - e.g. Palaemon pacificus (Kurihara, 2008) - increased 

embryonic development duration characterized by a delayed time to hatching – e.g. Semibalanus 

balanoides (Findlay et al., 2009) – reduced survival and growth in amphipods – e.g. Peramphithoe 

parmerong (Poore et al., 2013) and Gammarus pulex (Taylor et al., 1994) – changes in palatability to 

food sources – e.g. Peramphithoe parmerong (Poore et al., 2013) –and changes in the expression of 

metabolically relevant enzymes in the amphipod Gammarus locusta (Hauton et al., 2009), etc.  



5 

 

  OA is also known to effectively disrupt chemically-mediated, fitness enhancing behaviours in 

both fish and crustacean groups – e.g. Pagurus bernhardus (de la Haye et al., 2012), among others 

(Briffa et al., 2012). Most results indicate that exposures to CO2 enriched water affect the olfactory 

system on some level that is not directly linked to the chemical modification of odour cues (Leduc et 

al., 2013). Therefore, exposure to high-CO2 (and the resulting hypercapnia) is responsible for the 

majority of observed disruptions in the physiology and behaviour of marine animals, particularly in 

crustaceans, which behaviour can be directly affected by direct interference in acid-base balance 

maintenance (Pörtner et al., 2004, Briffa et al., 2012). Hypercapnia could lead to behavioural changes 

through a series of processes: i) as a consequence of systemic physiological changes that reduce the 

energy available to the individual or alter its metabolic processes (Pörtner et al., 2004); ii) changes in 

neural mechanisms required for processing information (Nilsson et al., 2012); iii) or the disruption of 

the signal reception – through physical impairment of receptive organs, alteration of the receptors or in 

some situations, changes in the signalling molecules (Briffa et al., 2012).  

 The impacts resulting from long-term high-CO2 exposure in crustaceans, and many other marine 

groups, remain relatively unknown (Whiteley, 2011). While some species show negative effects to OA 

exposure, others show no measurable effects or are even positively affected by exposure to mid- to high-

CO2 conditions (Whiteley, 2011). Thus, it is highly important to include crustacean species as models 

in trans- and multigenerational experiments, to better understand the subtle effects of ocean acidification 

that may be concealed by resilience to short-term exposures.  

 

 1.1.2 Trans-/multigenerational approaches on OA  

 

 When studying the effects of ocean acidification or other environmental stressors on marine 

organisms, it is important to consider the potential long-term, evolutionary effects. For some time, 

studies focused on the impact of high-CO2 exposure stress on either ‘adult individuals’ or ‘larvae’ 

(Parker et al., 2012) and ignored the potential link that exists between different life-history stages and 

different generations, and possible effects that might be passed down from adults to their offspring – 

parental effects (see Figure 1.1.3) (Dupont et al., 2010, Kroeker et al., 2010, Parker et al., 2012). 

 Marine organisms might be able to maintain their performance in future OA conditions either 

through acclimation or through evolutionary adaptation (Munday, 2014, Sunday et al., 2014, Calosi et 

al., 2016). Acclimation involves phenotypically plastic responses at the physiological, morphological or 

behavioural level, which can help maintain individual fitness in a new environment (Sunday et al., 2014). 

Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of one genotype to produce a range of phenotypes under different 

environmental conditions (Fordyce, 2006), which plays a key role in determining an organism’s fitness 

and subsequent ecological performance when challenged with highly selective pressures (Gibbin et al., 

2017).  

 Adaptation, involves the selection on genetic variation, by retaining favourable genotypes in a 

population, which in turn alters its structure by shifting the average phenotype towards a new, optimal 

fitness peak for the conditions encountered (Sunday et al., 2014). Acclimation, in turn is a short-term 

response which can either be reversible, developmental or transgenerational. Reversible acclimation 

occurs in hours to days or even months, and allows an individual to temporarily adjust its physiology 

and behaviour to survive the stress imposed by a sudden change. Developmental acclimation can occur 

when exposure to a novel environment happens during early-life phases of an individual, enhancing its 

ability to survive to that same environment later in life. Finally, transgenerational acclimation occurs 

when the environment experienced by the parent positively influences the performance of the offspring 

exposed to that same environment (See Figure 1.1.3). Sometimes, a phenomenon called “phenotypic 



6 

 

buffering” can lead to the apparent absence of differential responses in certain traits, between different 

environments, but a longer, multigenerational exposure might be enough to elicit clear positive or 

negative responses (Munday, 2014, Sunday et al., 2014). 

 There is growing consensus that on short ecological time-scales, evolution can occur (Carroll et 

al., 2007) - through standing variation or from the appearance of new mutations (Kelly and Hofmann, 

2013) - and that adaptation could reduce or compensate the risk of extinction during periods of rapid 

environmental changes (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009). Both genetic adaptation and acclimation can help 

organisms persist in the face of environmental change, and understanding the links between these 

processes will be critical for predicting the evolutionary responses of marine organisms to OA (Sunday 

et al., 2014).  

  

 A possible approach to measure the scope for adaptation is experimental evolution (Kelly and 

Hofmann, 2013). In this approach, populations of (typically) short-lived organisms of easy maintenance 

in laboratory, are exposed to simulated future conditions over a set of generations, and then are compared 

to control populations for the evaluation of possible signs of adaptation. Multi-generational experiments 

are needed to anticipate the adaptive capacity of marine organisms over the next century given the 

current rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 (The Royal Society, 2005).  

 Some of the most recent multigenerational approaches for OA in marine animal groups are 

summarized in Table 1.1.1. Most negative effects that occur at a transgenerational level seem to affect 

fecundity, development metabolism and behaviour. Despite the existence of examples of parental effects 

or adaptive potential that could alleviate some of these impacts, there are also species that show 

increasingly negative consequences of OA exposure with each subsequent generation. It is still unknown 

how most marine groups will fare in the future, due to intra-group responses being so variable. It is 

important to conduct broader, longer and more holistic multigenerational experiments, in order to ensure 

the understanding of how marine organisms will change under the selective pressure of future global 

change drivers, and better predict population, community and ecosystem level responses (Calosi et al., 

2016).   

 

Figure 1.1.3. Parents influence the phenotype of their offspring through both genetic and non-genetic pathways. The 

environment experienced by parents can influence the phenotype of their offspring through a variety of non-genetic 

mechanisms. In fishes, for instance, these mechanisms include nutritional provisioning of eggs, transfer of hormones or 

proteins to eggs, or epigenetic marks from either the mother or the father. Transgenerational acclimation occurs when the 

performance of offspring in a particular environment is improved when parents have experienced the same environment 

(Munday, 2014).

 1.2. Study species: the amphipod Gammarus locusta 

  
 

  1.2.1 Distribution and ecology 

 

 Gammarus locusta (Linnaeus, 1758) (Figure 1.2.1) is a relatively known and frequent species 

in both coastal and estuarine waters along the North-eastern Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.2.2), namely from 

the coasts of Norway (Lincoln, 1979a), Iceland (Ingólfsson, 1977) and the British Isles (Lincoln, 1979b) 

– to the Baltic and North seas, the Azores Islands, and the Atlantic coasts of France, Spain and Portugal 

(Maren, 1975, Costa and Costa, 1999, Costa, 2000, Costello, 2010). In Portugal, its occurrence has been 

reported in numerous locations along the coast, such as the Mondego, Sado, Mira, Aveiro and Alvor 

estuaries, among others (Costa and Costa, 1999, Neuparth et al., 2002). 

  

 G. locusta is described as a marine, euryhaline species (Remane and Schlieper, 1958), and has 

won the connotation of being «the most common, purely marine form in the temperate eastern atlantic 

ocean» (Stock, 1967), which even though it is not accurate, this conotation emphazyses the high 

abundance of this amphipod. Records on this species’ occurrence indicate that it prefers conditions that 

are closer to the open sea (Costa, 2000), but this amphipod still penetrates brackish waters to some extent 

and, according to some authors, tolerates considerable reductions in salinity - given that an adequate 

acclimation period is provided (Costa, 2000). In fact, individuals are frequently found in the infra- and 

intertidal zones, and can endure a wide range of salinities – from as low as 5 and up to 40 (Costa and 

Costa, 1999). They are also able to adapt to very different types of habitats - which include rocky 

coastlines and sandy or muddy substrates, as well as Zostera sp. beds – as long as these are associated 

with a high coverage of macroalgae (Oliveira Costa et al., 1996, Costa and Costa, 1999, Ruppert, 2004). 

The macroalgae’s structures, and their filamentous and branded epiphytes create a complex 

environment, which acts as the perfect substrate for shelter and refuge from predators, as well as a food 

source for this gammarid.

  1.2.2 Trophic relationships 

  

 G. locusta is an omnivorous, opportunistic, deposit-feeder species (Costa and Costa, 2000), 

whose diet includes a variety of different seaweeds and the occasional predation of smaller organisms 

or even conspecifics. This species has been shown to consume a variety of food items, and maintains 

relationships of herbivory, detritivory, and cannibalism, both in the wild and in laboratory conditions 

(Costa and Costa, 1999, Costa and Costa, 2000, Costello, 2010). Studies have shown that the preferred 

food source for this small amphipod are macroalgae – such as Ulva spp. and Enteromorpha spp – which 

represents the major component of its natural diet, followed by detritus. This preference for algae makes 

this amphipod as an important mesograzer, helping in the suppression of overgrown ephemeral algae, 

e.g. in seagrass beds (Andersson et al., 2009).  

 This amphipod species is also crucial for higher trophic levels in coastal and estuarine food 

webs, being preyed upon by fish (Kuhlmann et al., 1982), shorebirds, and many other groups like 

nemertenians and larger crustaceans (Costa and Costa, 1999, Macneil et al., 1999). Its role as a consumer 

and a prey, alongside its wide latitudinal distribution (Figure 1.2.2), range and abundance, contribute to 

its high ecological relevance in numerous European coastal systems (Costa and Costa, 2000). 

 

  1.2.3 Life cycle and reproduction 

 

 Amphipods display a great diversity of life-history patterns (Sundelin et al., 2008) – e.g. 

semelparity, iteroparity, semi-annual, annual, biannual or perennial life cycles, presence or absence of 

pre-copulatory mate guarding (MG) behaviours, etc. - that are directly influenced by latitude, depth and 

salinity  (Appadoo and Myers, 2004). Overall, the general life cycle of a gammarid amphipod can be 

summed according to Figure 1.2.3.  

Figure 1.2.2. Distribution of Gammarus locusta in the 

NE Atlantic Ocean – adapted (Costa et al., 2004). 



11 

 

 In southern areas of its distribution, such as at the Sado estuary, G. locusta exhibits a 

multivoltine life cycle. This means that over a year, a female will produce more than two broods, and 

that reproductive activity is more or less continuous throughout most of this period (Costa and Costa, 

1999). The cycle is generally completed in 40 to 50 days, at 15 ºC (Neuparth et al., 2002), when 

individuals have achieved sexual maturity, mated, and given birth to a new generation. Increases in 

temperature have been linked to an average four-week reduction in the life-span of G. locusta, as well 

as an acceleration and condensation of their life cycle – which includes the anticipation of the age at 

maturity, and higher population growth rates (Neuparth et al., 2002). 

 The gender of adult G. locusta is clearly identifiable, since males and females exhibit some 

degree of sexual dimorphism. Males are characterized by the existence of a genital papillae on the 

ventral surface of the 7th thoracic segment, and can be easily differentiated by their enlarged 2nd pair of 

gnathopods. Females, in turn, can be distinguished by the presence of brood plates (i.e. oostegites), 

which hold the eggs and developing embryos in the ventral area and thus create a brood pouch or 

marsupium. In females, the visual indicator of sexual maturity is the development of setae on the surface 

of the brood plates (Sundelin et al., 2008). 

 In the Sado estuary, females reach maturity at approximately 28 days of age (or 7 mm in length), 

depending on habitat conditions (Costa and Costa, 1999, Hauton et al., 2009), and a female’s investment 

in her progeny begins right at oogenesis. In crustaceans, large quantities of lipids are deposited into 

developing oocytes – mainly monounsaturated fatty acids – which are used during embryo development 

(Morais et al., 2002, Rosa et al., 2005). The number of eggs produced by a female varies considerably 

between different species (Sundelin et al., 2008). For example, G. minus, produce an average of 4 to 9 

eggs per female (Glazier et al., 1992), while Gammarus zaddachi is known to produce over one hundred 

eggs per brood (Cheng, 1942). 

 Shortly before mating, and following the parturial moult – i.e. the moult that signals a female’s 

maturity and reproductive availability, with the added development of setae on the brood pouches – the 

female’s oocytes are sorted into eggs that will pass down through the oviduct wall and exit into the 

female’s marsupium (Sutcliffe, 2010b). The passage of the eggs into the brood pouch can only happen 

during a short-time period, after the moult has occurred and the new exoskeleton is still soft, because 

this is the time when the oviduct wall is still malleable enough to conform to the egg’s passage.  

Figure 1.2.3. Life cycle of a Gammarid amphipod.  



12 

 

This reduced window of time created a challenge for amphipod reproduction since, despite the fact that 

the female’s moult, and thus fertility, is predictable, males have few opportunities to find and mate with 

fertile females unless they develop a strategy to maximize their probabilities. It is believed that this is 

the reason behind the evolutionary appearance of a precopulatory stage called mate-guarding (MG), in 

which males will guard and effectively carry a pre-moulting female to ensure their place as the fertilizers 

of the eggs – males will use their enlarged pair of gnathopods to clasp and hold the smaller females until 

they moult (Steele and Steele, 1986). Precopulatory MG can last up to 8 – 10 days, and is dependent on 

the female’s moult and external abiotic conditions (Sutcliffe, 2010b) 

 When body contact occurs between a mature male and a receptive female, the male will catch 

and clasp the female by an appendage and place her lengthwise beneath him, in the position of 

precopulatory amplexus. The male is able to swim whilst carrying the female, which can either remain 

in a curled position or straighten her body and contribute to the locomotor activity, by beating her 

pleopods (Borowsky, 1984, Ward, 1985, Sutcliffe, 2010a). After the eggs have passed through into the 

marsupium, the male rotates the female underneath him so that he can deposit his spermatophores and 

hence fertilize the eggs (Sutcliffe, 2010a).  

 These processes of male attraction and MG rely on chemosensory information that is transmitted 

by means of waterborne chemical signals produced by the females. It has been suggested that secretion 

of these hormones happens in two stages: the secretion of a “primary ovarian hormone” by the ovary’s 

primary follicular cells, which controls the development of the oostegites (Sutcliffe, 2010a); and the 

secretion of a “temporary ovarian hormone”, at the secondary follicular cells, which controls the 

development of temporary sexual features such as the long ovigerous setae that cover the oostegites 

during vitellogenesis (Sutcliffe, 2010a). 

 Males use their aesthetascs to detect female pheromones, thus enabling the search for a cue 

releasing female and the initiation of precopulatory behaviours (Gleeson, 1982, Hallberg et al., 1997). 

In some species – e.g. G. pulex and G. duebeni – the urine of female’s acts as an attractant solution for 

males in the water column (Dunham, 1978, Borowsky, 1985). The presence of a specific pheromone, 

probably ecdysone or ecdysterone - which control the impending moult in the female and hence signals 

the short fertility period (Ducruet, 1975) – or a mixture of substances produced at the same time, is 

suggested to be the vehicle of this attraction (Hammoud et al., 1975).  

 In Gammarus, attraction is present in two different levels: on long distances – by means of a 

long distance pheromone, probably present in the female’s urine; and on short distances – by means of 

a body contact pheromone, secreted in the female’s exoskeleton. While the first is able to operate at a 

distance to attract nearby males (Dahl et al., 1970, Borowsky, 1985, Borowsky and Borowsky, 1987), 

the second is released in the female’s external body cuticle and elicits courtship and MG behaviour in 

males (Sutcliffe, 2010a). In 1985, Borowsky demonstrated the existence of long-distance sexual 

attraction in Gammarus palustris, showing that when males were exposed to cues from conspecifics and 

congenerics in different maturity stages, in binary choice Y-mazes, they were «more often attracted to 

receptive females», compared to non-receptive females and other males (Borowsky, 1985). The effect 

of other cues (e.g. from fish, invertebrates, algae and from the environment) as attractants and repellents 

on gammarid amphipods has also been described (Williams and Moore, 1985). 

 At ambient conditions, embryonic development – spanning from egg incubation to post-hatch 

juveniles – has been described to last from 15 to 18 days (Neuparth et al., 2002, Maranhão and Marques, 

2003, Sutcliffe, 2010a). For a couple of days, post-hatch juveniles are able to move freely in and out of 

the female’s marsupium, and begin taking chances in feeding outside the brood pouch. Juvenile 

development until adulthood takes 6 to 7 weeks at 15 ºC, and it is estimated that G. locusta life span can 

reach from 6 months (Neuparth et al., 2002) to a full year (Ruppert, 2004).

2. Objectives          
 

 

 The objective of the present dissertation was to investigate for the first time the transgenerational 

effects of OA exposure (pCO2 = 800-900 ?atm) on the physiology, behaviour and reproductive 

processes of a gammarid amphipod – G. locusta. Understanding how reproductive traits and 

metabolism, may or may not be impacted by environmental change, and whether these effects are carried 

throughout subsequent generations, will allow us to infer about the sustainability of amphipod 

populations in an acidified ocean. Within this context, I hypothesised that this scenario could lead to: 

 1. Reduction in MG behaviour duration due to metabolic stress; 

 2. Decrease in female investment in reproduction (number of eggs per female) as a result of 

 energy reallocation;  

 3. Negative effects on fecundity (number of surviving juveniles per female); 

 4. Decreased survival into adulthood;  

 5. Disruption of male chemosensory reception / attraction to female waterborne pheromones; 

 6. Negative effects on the amphipod’s aerobic metabolic rates induced by physiological stress.  

 The transgenerational analysis between two successive generations (parental F0 and F1) allowed 

to test hypothesis 1 through 4. Chemosensory disruption and the possibility of metabolic alteration 

(hypothesis 5 and 6) were tested only on the F1 generation, due to constraints on setup availability and 

optimization.

3. Materials and Methods         
 

 

 3.1. Amphipod collection and stock maintenance 
 

 A stock culture of G. locusta was established using a mix of individuals collected in the wild 

from a clean site in the South margin of the Sado Estuary (38°27?N,08°43?W), Portugal, and others from 

a pre-existing culture, originally collected in the same estuary, and kindly provided by the 

Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR). The sampling site has been 

previously used by other authors for amphipod sampling and collection (see Figure 3.1.1), and has been 

referenced as a relatively non-contaminated, clean site, with high biological diversity (Costa and Costa, 

1999, Neuparth et al., 2002, Martinez-Haro et al., 2016).  

 The collection process included the gathering of large macroalgae clusters, and the scrapping of 

the first layers of sandy sediment in the intertidal area at low tide, to ensure recovery for the maximum 

possible number of individuals. The algae and sand were thoroughly washed and stored in coolers for 

transportation with enough water and aeration. Upon arrival at the Laboratório Marítimo da Guia 

(LMG), in Cascais, these were washed and sorted, and all material processed to ensure collection of the 

maximum number of live individuals of the target amphipod species, for stock reinforcement. 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 All stocks were kept under stable conditions similar to those found in their natural environment, 

and the same physico-chemical conditions were applied in the control treatments during the 

experimental phase (See Table 3.1.1). Individuals were left to acclimate to laboratorial conditions for at 

least two generations (approximately 60-70) days.

sampling site, indicated by a black circle (Costa and Costa, 
1999)

Table 3.2.1. Seawater physiochemical parameters in all experimental setups. Temperature, salinity and pH were measured daily 

and averaged per replicate and per treatment. Total alkalinity (TA) and pCO2 were quantified using the CO2SYS software. 

Values represent mean ± SD.  

 

  

 

 

 

 

 A continuous, fresh supply of green algae (Ulva sp.) was maintained and fish flakes were added 

once a week as nutritional enrichment, following Costa (1996), who showed that the use of this 

supplement stimulated individual growth rates and reduced cannibalism in ex-situ populations (Costa 

and Costa, 2000). Stocks were filled with a 2 cm layer of sandy substrate and rocks and small PVC pipes 

to simulate natural shelter. Water was continuously aerated and was fully replaced at least two times a 

week.  

 

 3.2. OA exposure 
 

 OA experimental design followed the guidelines of experimental design for acidification 

research (Cornwall and Hurd, 2016). The flow-through aquatic systems were set in order to maintain 

total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon speciation due to bacterial activity and acidification of 

treatments, and the setup consisted in two 20 L tank setups (5 independent replicate tanks per treatment). 

F0 gammarids were exposed to the following experimental conditions: i) control scenario (18 °C, pH 

8.0, 300-400 µatm); and ii) hypercapnic scenario (18 °C, pH 7.7, 800-900 µatm). The values chosen for 

pH and pCO2 levels for the control and acidified groups were defined according to relevant climate 

change projections (Doney et al., 2012, IPCC, 2014), and temperature was kept constant at mean annual 

values for the individual’s area of origin in the Sado estuary Table 3.2.1. pH levels were adjusted 

automatically, via solenoid valves, using the Profilux controlling system (Profilux 3.1, GHL, Germanry) 

connected to individual pH probes, which monitored values every 2 seconds and lowered 

the pH by injection of a certified CO2 gas mixture (Air Liquide, Portugal) via air stones, or upregulated 

by aerating the tanks.

 Recording of temperature, salinity and pH was performed daily. The quantification of pH in the 

replicate tanks was determined using a pH meter (826 pH mobile, Metrohm, Germany) connected to a 

glass electrode (Schott IoLine, SI analytics), calibrated with TRIS-HCI (TRIS) and 2-aminopyridine-

HCl (AMP) (Mare, Belgium) seawater buffers. Seawater carbonate system speciation (SCSS) was 

quantified following the same method described in Repolho et al. (2017). SCSS was calculated from 

TA (total alkalinity, measured by spectrophotometry at 595 nm) and pH measurements. Values of 

bicarbonate and pCO2 were calculated using the CO2SYS software (Carbon Dioxide Information 

Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA), with dissociation constant, as refitted.  

 Temperature inside the tanks was kept constant by partial immersion in a large bath, supplied 

with water that was conditioned by a chiller and thermostats to the desired levels. The tanks were 

illuminated from above with white fluorescent lamps, with a fixed photoperiod of 12 h light and 12 h 

dark). Daily water renewal for each replicate was calculated to be approximately 10 times its volume. 

 

 3.3. Transgenerational design 
 

 The transgenerational experimental design is summarized in Figure 3.3.1.  

 Thirty MG couples were randomly selected from the stock tanks at the beginning of the 

experimental phase. These individuals were maintained in two 60-L tanks (15 couples for each 

treatment) and gradually acclimated to the desired treatment conditions (i.e. pH was maintained at 8.0 

for the controls and decreased gradually by 0.1 units per day in the acidified treatments, until reaching 

the target pH). This procedure guaranteed that the first generation (F0 or paternal generation) was 

conceived and developed already under the respective treatment conditions and, as such, exposure to 

each pH level was assured since shortly before the beginning of the embryonic development.   

 Following acclimation, normal gestation was allowed to continue with removal of the males 

from the pre-F0 population after the end of the MG behaviour. Upon birth and exit from the mother’s 

brood pouch, new-borns were randomly sorted into the 4-L replicate tanks (Figure 3.3.2). A total of 25 

new-borns were randomly placed into each treatment’s 5 replicates.  

Figure 3.3.1. Global experimental design: after ensuring 60 to 70 days of stock acclimation, the last new-born individuals were 

left to develop and reach maturity. These individuals would be separated into two groups: one control and one acidified, which 

would then constitute the parental generation (F0). The progeny resulting of the intra-group reproduction would be separated, 

with half being subjected to the same treatment conditions as their progenitors, and the other subjected to conditions of the 

opposing treatment.  



17 

 

 

 Each experimental generation was reared from juvenile to sexual maturity (approximately 30 

days of age). After this period, sampling of reproductive, behavioural and metabolic outputs (i.e. the 

latter only for the F1 generation, as previously mentioned) took place, with the collection of new-borns 

to ensure the establishment of the following generation. Population size depended on youngling 

recruitment, and replicates were populated with 25 new-born F1 individuals. 

 

 3.4. Reproductive traits 
 

 3.4.1 Reproductive traits 

 

 Reproductive outputs were measured continuously upon each generation’s pre-reproductive 

phase. Starting at approximately 20 days of exposure, when overall size, behaviour and sexual 

dimorphism indicated that individuals would soon reach maturity, tanks were checked twice a day for 

recently formed pre-copulatory MG couples. When identified, these couples were separated from the 

group and placed into transparent plastic cups (220-mL) filled with their respective replicate’s water. 

This allowed for an accurate measurement of the desired outputs and also helped to minimize the risk 

of cannibalism of females by other extra-couple individuals or aggressiveness interfering with mating 

and embryonic development. After couple separation, males were quickly removed from the cups and 

reintroduced into their original population. The time (in days) from MG initiation until separation was 

registered. Afterwards, approximately half of the ovigerous females were sacrificed for determination 

of female investment, while the other half was allowed to complete gestation, with measurement of 

embryonic development time and fecundity. A total of 146 females (50 ? in F0 and 96 ? in F1) and 61 

males (for the MG duration output) were sampled.  

 

3.4.2 Female investment   

 

 Given the difficulty of isolating a female prior to reaching sexual maturity, without resorting to 

invasive and time consuming morphological analysis (due to the apparent similarities between immature 

females and young females, and to the lack of synchronization in female’s reproductive cycles), only 

ovigerous females possessing fertilized eggs were sampled. Investment was then accounted as the total 

number of eggs present in the marsupium of a gravid female, after MG behaviours had ceased and the 

couple had separated.  

Figure 3.3.2. Schematic (left) and photograph (right) of the 4 L replicate tanks used in the setup. In the photograph, the tubes 

which conducted water from the mixture tanks by gravity can be observed, as well as the stones and PVC pipes placed above 

the substrate for shelter and the small clusters of Ulva sp. supplied for both shelter and nutrition.  



18 

 

 Previous trials demonstrated that females could be anesthetized either via short time exposure 

to low temperatures or carbonated water (Sundelin et al., 2008), followed by lateral and ventral 

photography and consequent egg count with ImageJ. This allowed females to be returned to their 

respective population, preventing their sacrifice, and even allow for a direct comparison between a 

female’s investment and the total number of younglings that reached the end of their embryonic 

development. However, comparisons between photographic data and data from the sacrifice of a number 

of females showed a disparity of over 60% in the total number of eggs. As such, in order to ensure a 

correct measurement of the number of eggs inside the brood pouch, females were sacrificed by freezing 

(-80 ºC) shortly after the parting of the male. 

 After sacrifice, a female’s marsupium would be gently scrapped using a blunt laboratory 

tweezer, in the anterior-posterior direction. This allowed for efficient egg removal and minimized 

potential egg damage or loss (Figure 3.4.2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.4.3 Embryonic development and Fecundity  

 

 To estimate the average duration of embryonic development, the amount of time (in days) 

spanning from oviposition and male fertilization, to the exit of all juveniles in the female’s brood pouch 

was registered. Females with recently fertilized eggs were kept separated from the rest of the population, 

and maintained in plastic cups until eventual youngling departure. Small pieces of algae were supplied 

to ensure enough food was available for the female and her progeny, thus minimizing losses by maternal 

cannibalism.  

 When the marsupium appeared empty, water from the cups was processed and juveniles 

separated from the females. Female fecundity was accounted as the number of juveniles released per 

female in each replicate (Maranhão and Marques, 2003). Following separation from their mother, 

juveniles were counted and pooled in small tanks per replicate, in preparation for the next experimental 

generation.

 3.5 Behavioural trials 
  

 In order to investigate the possible disruption of a male’s chemosensory reception to female 

scent cues in the water column, a binary-choice experiment was designed. The chosen experimental 

setup (Figure 3.5.1) was based on a system that was firstly described in 1913, and developed to study 

the response of fishes to different levels of dissolved O2 and CO2 (Shelford and Allee, 1913). Since then, 

this design has been used and adapted by several authors to test chemical preference and avoidance in 

marine organisms (Hall et al., 1982, Hall et al., 1984, Pinkney et al., 1985, Dempsey, 2009) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 A 60 x 20 cm rectangular arena, with a water depth of 3 cm, was used (Figure 3.5.2). A single 

individual was placed in the choice arena, where it would be able to swim freely between two opposing 

water masses (i.e. one containing female scent cues to incite a males’ response, and other corresponding 

to clean filtered seawater). The water masses were continuously supplied, in a flow through manner, by 

two 20 L header tanks, in which cues had been prepared for at least 48 hours prior to trials, by leaving 

the highest possible number of adult females in a tank to release odours (e.g. urine and pheromones) 

capable of attracting males. A drain, placed at the centre of the starting zone, allowed a constant water 

height while ensuring that both cue flows continuously drained away, hence creating two opposing water 

currents. As mentioned, one header tank was filled with normal filtered seawater, while the other was 

filled with water from the same source and populated with 30 to 35 stock adult females. Both header 

tanks were continuously aerated. Amphipod males were tested in the respective treatment-conditioned 

water. The possibility that acidified water would damage or degrade the female cues involved in male 

attraction was accounted for.   



20 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Preliminary testing was performed for setup optimization, in order to establish optimum flow 

rates to prevent mixture between the two water masses (See Figure 3.5.3 and Video 1 in supplemental). 

These tests consisted on the definition of a specific flow and by visual analysis using a blue dye (food 

colouring).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Following setup optimization, an amphipod’s position after being released from the starting 

compartment could be accurately determined – association zone A or B – with minimum error. The 

starting zone was used to randomly assign the position of the starting compartment in each arena, and 

to minimize possible biases and uncontrolled variables that could interfere with the water flow and hence 

prevent a confident analysis of the first seconds of trial run following release. Each trial consisted of a 

total run time of 20 minutes: 10 minutes acclimation and initial exposure, and 10 minutes of free 

movement inside the arena. Amphipods were placed in small perforated holding containers inside the 

starting zone, to acclimate to the water flow and overall surroundings. Acclimation duration was decided 

after preliminary trials, as it ensured a minimum exposure to the cues to allow for initial stimulation. 

After 10 minutes, the containers were lifted one by one, and the amphipod’s movements were recorded 

with a video camera for posterior analysis. A total of 24 adult males from the F1 generation (12 per main 

treatment, 2 to 3 per treatment) were randomly selected from the replicate tanks and tested two times, 

with cue input reversal. The response time of an amphipod – the time required for it to start moving – 

as well as first choice of direction and cumulative time (i.e. the mean proportion of time spent in the 

presence of the female cue, compared to the total amount of time spent in both association zones) were

registered. Out of the 24 males used in these trials only those that met the following requirements were 

included for the statistical analysis: i) an individual’s initial response time was less than one minute 

(60s); ii) a male’s first choice for direction of movement was clearly defined (i.e. the male did not move 

to the centre drain, and instead chose one of the association zones); iii) an individual spent at least 7 

minutes (70% of the total trial time) exhibiting active searching or exploratory behaviours.  

 

 3.6 Routine Metabolic Rate (RMR) – Oxygen consumption  
  

 Measurements of routine metabolic rate (O2 consumption rate) were used to address possible 

effects of OA on amphipod’s metabolic fitness. RMR is an ecologically relevant measure of metabolism, 

that is applied in situations when an animal’s locomotor activity cannot be completely controlled (i.e. 

the animal is neither completely still, nor completely active during measures) (Ikeda, 2016). The design 

consisted of a static, intermittent flow-through respirometry system (Clark et al., 2013) and is 

represented in Figure 3.6.1. The dimensions and volume of the chamber (Vchamber + tubbing = 90 mL) were 

defined according to the average individual size of G. locusta, so that a large individual could easily be 

accommodated in a static position. At the same time, the combined volume of chamber plus tubbing 

was small enough to allow a correct measurement of individual amphipod’s O2 consumption rate, 

without it mixing with background respiration noise – the possible consumption by microorganisms in 

the water column.  

 Oxygen measurements were achieved by attaching a small sensor spot (thin sheet of material 

coated in relevant O2 sensing chemicals), on the inside of one of the transparent faces of the cylindrical 

chambers. A fibre-optic sensor was attached in the same area on the outside of the chamber, which 

measured small changes in the sensor spot material’s colour, which reacted to the amount of dissolved 

oxygen in the water volume. Recirculation was needed in order to prevent water stratification that could 

potentially bias measurements: this was achieved by using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S® series), 

which ensured a continuous flow of approximately 40 ml min -1. The entire system was submerged in a 

bath of oxygenated and previously conditioned water to the desired pH and temperature levels.

 Each amphipod was gently introduced into one sealed acrylic chamber, following sensor 

calibration in O2 saturated water, and then left for 40 minutes to acclimate to the chamber with 

recirculating water. Following acclimation, a 5-minute flush with oxygenated water from the bath 

signalled the start of a 25-minute measurement period, and was performed by means of a flush pump. 

Each flush ensured that O2 levels inside the chamber returned to start values, and the run-time of 25 

minutes ensured that they never fell below 80% air saturation levels (Hughes, 1973, Clark et al., 2013). 

A total of 3 flushes (three replicate measurements) were made for each individual and no individual was 

used twice. Both acclimation and measurement periods were based on Ramus &amp;amp; Forward (2011), who 

measured oxygen uptake rates in the amphipod Talorchestia longicornis. In order to ensure proper 

acclimation to the chamber and to the respirometry system, an acclimation time of 40 minutes was 

considered for G. locusta. A total of 28 individuals (14 per treatment) were sampled using this 

methodology. Efforts were made to ensure that amphipods remained not stressed for the majority of run 

time, to minimize the possible disturbance of O2 gradients, or peaks of activity (Clark et al., 2013): tests 

were conducted under reduced lighting and the experimenter’s movements next to the respirometry 

system were minimized and concealed from the animal’s view, in order to reduce possible stress-induced 

movements.  

 Oxygen consumption during each 25-minute run was logged in Pyro Oxygen Logger 

Software®. After each test, the individual amphipod’s wet weight (WW) was determined to the nearest 

1e-5 g, by removing excess water with paper towelling for 5 to 10 seconds, and then transferring them 

to a tared petri-dish (Halcrow and Boyd, 1967). Sex as well as a qualitative measure of the animal’s 

activity during trials were registered. Data from animals that were apparently stressed was not taken into 

consideration. Determination of mass-specific RMR (µmol O2 g
-1 h-1) is widely common in fish and can 

also be applied to molluscs and crustaceans (Clark et al., 2013), according to the formula presented 

below. 

 

3.6.1. Routine Metabolic Rate (µmol O2 g-1 H-1) =
[(?????)???2]

?? (?)? ?? (?)
 

 

 The slope of oxygen consumption for each 25-minute registry period was calculated by applying 

a linear regression to the continuous raw trace (?O2/?t), and only slope regressions with coefficients (R2) 

greater than 0.90 were used. Given that an individual’s volume (Vf) did not constitute over 5% the total 

volume of the chamber + tubbing (Vr), the individual volume was discarded for all calculations.

4. Data analysis  
 

 

 For all reproductive outputs, intra-generation and intra-treatment comparisons, as well as cross-

treatment comparisons were performed to evaluate transgenerational effects of ocean acidification, and 

possible carry-over effects.  

 In behavioural and metabolic outputs, results concern only the main acidified (AA) and main 

control treatments (CC) from the F1 generation and, thus, no transgenerational analysis is performed.  

 Important terminology used for the analysis, and which will be used in the results and discussion 

sections follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Analysis of reproductive outputs was performed via generalized linear models (GLM) using the 

Poisson family of distribution. When Poisson over dispersion was different than 1, the family of 

distribution was changed to Negative Binomial (dispersion higher than 1) or to Quasipoisson (dispersion 

smaller than 1), and model definitions adjusted accordingly. Behavioural outputs were also analysed 

with resort to GLM, with the appropriate families of distribution: Gaussian (response time), Gamma 

(cumulative time) and Binomial (first choice). Oxygen consumption rates were analysed via GLMs for 

continuous variables (Gaussian).  

 For all models, «Generation», «Treatment», and «Replicate» and, in the behavioural trials, 

«Test» and «Individual» were included as factors, to account for intrinsic variability in random effects 

analysis. The best model for each output was ultimately chosen with resource to the calculation of the 

Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) – as a rule, the best model was the one which featured the smallest 

AIC. All data analysis was performed in RStudio Software (Version 1.0.143– © 2009-2016 RStudio, 

Inc.)

5. Results 
  

 5.1. Survival  
  

 Results for the survival (%) analysis are presented in figure 5.1.1 and in table 5.1.1. Survival of 

individuals was significantly affected by high-CO2 exposure for the first generation (GLMM, z: -1.97, 

p &amp;lt;0.05), with a mean value of approximately 65%, below survival of F0 amphipods exposed to control 

conditions (75%). In F1, survival in control (CC) and acidified (AA) treatments remained stable 

compared to the F0 equivalents while cross treatments AC and CA exhibited lower survival rates (CC 

x AC – GLMM, z: 2.90, p &amp;lt;0.001; CC x CA – GLMM, z: 3.41, p &amp;lt;0.001). Individuals that were born 

and raised under acidified conditions as their parents, named AA in the figure 5.1.1b, showed a wide 

range of survival values, from approximately 30 to 90%. No significant differences were found between 

the main acidified and control groups (GLMM, z: -1.61, p &gt; 0.05). Likewise, cross-treatments AC and 

CA showed no differences between them (GLMM, z: 0.57, p &gt; 0.05) nor between the main F1 acidified 

treatment (AA x AC – GLMM, z: 1.36, p &gt; 0.05; AA x CA – GLMM, z: 1.92, p &gt; 0.05).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Both control and acidified treatments showed no significant differences from F0 to F1 

(Acidification – GLM, z: -0.641, p &gt; 0.05; Control – GLM, z: -0.194, p &gt; 0.05). Regarding cross-

treatment comparisons, only the parental cross F1 CA x F0 CC revealed significant differences in mean 

replicate survival (see Table 5.1.1).

 5.2. Reproductive Traits 
 

 5.2.1 Mate-guarding duration 

 

 The results of the mate-guarding duration analysis are presented in Figures 5.2.1 and table 5.2.1. 

Data revealed that mate-guarding duration lasted, in average, up to five days. In the parental generation 

(F0), MG duration was significantly reduced in couples subjected to high-CO2, compared to the control 

group (GLM, t: 2.995, p &amp;lt;0.05). In the F1 generation, both the main acidified (AA) and control 

treatments (CC) showed no significant differences (GLM, t: 1, p &gt; 0.05. Regarding cross-treatments in 

F1 comparisons, significant differences were found between the CC and CA treatments (GLM, t: -4.363, 

p &amp;lt;0.05), but no significant differences between AC and AA (GLM, t: -1.560, p &gt; 0.05).  

 

 No significant inter-generation differences (F0 x F1) were found in either of the main treatments 

(Acidification – GLM, t: 0.738, p &gt; 0.05; Control – GLM, t: -1.746, p &gt; 0.05).

 5.2.2 Female investment 

  

 The results regarding the female investment, expressed as the mean number of eggs carried, are 

shown in Figure 5.2.2.  

   

  Females from the first generation that were reared in a high-CO2 environment produced 

significantly more eggs than their control counterparts (GLM, z: -3.269, p &amp;lt;0.0001), but this tendency 

was reversed in F1 (GLM, z: 2.185, p &amp;lt;0.05). Also in F1, the cross-treatment CA showed an egg count 

per female significantly higher than the other treatments, and - just as in F0 - this treatment produced 

significantly more eggs than the control group of the same generation (GLM, z: 1.997, p &amp;lt;0.05).   

 Regarding inter-generation comparisons (F0 x F1), a significant reduction in the number of eggs 

per female was observed in both the acidified (GLM, z: -6.784, p &amp;lt;0.0001) and the control treatments 

(GLM, z: -2.396, p &amp;lt;0.05), but from F0 to F1 differences are more pronounced for the high-CO2 group 

(see Figure 5.2.2). Cross comparisons for analysis of carry-over effects and first exposure equivalent are

 5.2.3 Duration of embryonic development 

 

 Results of the analysis of duration of embryonic development are presented in Figure 5.2.3. No 

significant effects of high-CO2 exposure on embryonic development duration were revealed by the 

statistical analysis for the F0 (A x C - GLM, z: 0.152, p &gt; 0.05) or F1 generations (A x C – GLM, z: 

0.228, p &gt; 0.05). Cross-treatments also showed similar mean durations as the other F1 groups (on 

average 10 days ± SD until all new-borns had left the marsupium). 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 Duration of embryonic development remained stable for both main treatments across 

generations, with no significant differences being revealed between F0 and F1 (Acidification – GLM, t: 

1.762, p &gt; 0.05; Control – GLM, t: 1.314, p &gt; 0.05).  

 In cross-treatment comparisons (see Table 5.2.3), no significant differences were revealed in the 

parental cross comparisons (F1 CA x F0 CC; F1 AC x F0 AA), and however, the CA treatment registered 

a significantly higher duration of embryonic development (approximately 11 days ± 1) compared with 

the first acidified treatment in F0 (approximately 9 days ± 2).

 The fecundity analysis results are presented in Figure 5.2.4 and Table 5.2.4.  

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 No significant differences were found on fecundity for the F0 generation (GLM, z: 1.356, p &gt; 

0.05), between acidified and control treatments. However, fecundity declined significantly from F0 to 

F1 in the acidified group (Acidification – GLM, z: -4.684, p &amp;lt;0.001), whilst the F1 main control group 

remained unaltered (Control – GLM, z: 1.356, p &gt; 0.05). Fecundity for F1 AA was also significantly 

lower than F1 CC (GLM, z: 4.286, p &amp;lt;0.001). Cross-treatments CA and AC were statistically similar 

(GLM, z: 0.786, p &gt; 0.05), and with fecundity values significantly lower than control (CC x CA – GLM, 

z: -3.175, p &amp;lt;0.05; CC x AC – GLM, z: -2.363, p &amp;lt;0.05). All cross comparisons featured significant 

differences (see Table 5.2.4).

 Regarding cumulative time, males from the acidified treatment spent significantly less time (in

-1 h-1) were significantly lower for individuals exposed to 

acidified conditions, compared to control individuals (LMM, t: 2.865, p &amp;lt;0.05). Gender comparisons 

for each treatment, however, revealed no significant differences in consumption rates between females 

and males for either treatment group (Acidified – LMM, t:-0.418, p &gt; 0.05; Control – LMM, t: -2.062,

6. Discussion 
 

 

 6.1. Survival 
 

 High-CO2 was responsible for causing a significant decline in the survival of G. locusta after 30 

days under experimental conditions. In the parental generation, survival decreased from approximately 

75-80% in the control group, to approximately 60-65% in the acidified treatment. For the same species, 

Hauton et al., (2009) reported similar survival rates (~65%) after a 25-day exposure to a 7.8 pH. The 

fact that survival in F1-CA was similar to the acidified treatment in F0 and was significantly lower 

compared to both F1-CC and their parent generation treatment F0-CC, reinforce evidence that within-

generation decrease in pH levels (acclimation exposure) significantly reduces survival for this 

amphipod. There was also evidence for the existence of parental effects in the cross from the acidified 

into the control conditions in F1 (F1-AC). Survival for this group was significantly lower than both the 

F1-AA and F1-CC treatments, and was similar to F1-CA. Although on F1 comparisons, the F1-AA 

treatment did not exhibit differences regarding the control group, this did not hint at a possible 

transgenerational acclimation by prolonged exposure. The absence of differences under OA between 

both generations, suggests that survival could be significantly reduced on a transgenerational level.  

 Decreases in survival could be related to impacts of OA on calcification and metabolism 

(Kroeker et al., 2010), which could result in altered energy allocation and consequent fitness reduction. 

Previous multigenerational studies have shown varied survival responses to OA in invertebrates. In the 

calanoid copepod, Acartia tsuensis, exposure to OA for two generations revealed no clear impact on 

survival (Kurihara, 2008). In the oyster Saccostrea glomerata, despite short-term transgenerational 

exposure to OA led to decreases in survival (Parker et al., 2012), prolonged exposure revealed the 

existence of positive carry-over effects, with larvae and juveniles exhibiting increased resilience (Parker 

et al., 2015). It is possible that a multigenerational exposure to OA could reveal the existence of positive 

carry-over effects regarding survival.  

 

 6.2. Reproductive traits 
 

  6.2.1 Mate-guarding 

  

 The significant reduction of the duration of precopulatory MG in the first acidified generation 

(both in F0-AA; and in F1-CA), suggests that first-generation acclimation to high-CO2 conditions could 

affect precopulatory behaviour and reproductive success in G. locusta.  

 The comparison of F1-CA with its parent group, as mentioned above, emphasises the short-term 

effects of acidification that significantly reduced the duration of MG behaviours. The other parental 

cross, F1-AC, showed that despite being reared in control conditions, the progeny of acidified 

individuals still exhibited shorter-duration MG periods. This hints at the presence of parental effects that 

are not alleviated nor worsened by a return to normocapnic conditions. Also, the significant differences 

between both first-generation exposure to high-CO2 treatments (F0-AA and F1-CA), although initially 

unexpected, don’t go against these assumptions, since MG duration was shorter in F1-CA.  



33 

 

 Shorter MG duration could be related with increased metabolic costs under OA. There is 

evidence that in Gammarus sp., males that are in poor energetic condition may be less able to pay the 

energetic costs associated with precopulatory mate-guarding (Plaistow et al., 2003). Hence, acidified 

males could be investing in shorter-duration MG behaviour, with the possible trade-off of increasing the 

probability of losing the role as the fertilizer of the eggs (i.e. if a male leaves the female before 

fertilization occurs), as a response to metabolic stress. Another possibility could be the reduction of 

parturial moult duration in pre-mature females - thus allowing shorter but still effective MG by males. 

However, sustained decreases in ocean pH of at least 0.5 units have already been proved to have no 

significant impacts in the moulting cycle of G. locusta (Hauton et al., 2009), suggesting the former 

hypothesis is the most probable one. 

  

  6.2.2 Female investment and fecundity 

 

 First-generational exposure to high-CO2 resulted in a significantly larger investment by females 

in the mean number of eggs of the first brood (for both F0-AA and F1-CA). Positive stimulation of egg 

production in response to high-CO2 induced stress is known to occur in crustaceans (Schade et al., 2014), 

although this stressor frequently induces either an effective decrease in female investment per brood, or 

no effects at all (Kroeker et al., 2010). Transgenerational exposure to high-CO2, however, revealed a 

pronounced decrease in egg production in F1-AA, compared to its parent treatment and to the F1-CC. 

This could imply that the physiological stress felt since birth or transmitted through the maternal line 

(possibly energetic trade-offs) not only led to a decrease in egg production regarding their parental 

treatment, but also resulted in an overall reduction in the number of eggs compared to the control group 

in F1.  

 The F1-AC treatment produced a mean number of eggs per brood similar to both F1 acidified 

and control groups. This suggests that negative effects of acidification have been introduced into the F1 

generation during either egg or embryo development (early in life, and possibly through maternal 

effects) and were not necessarily alleviated by transfer into control conditions. It is possible that some 

maternal effects are being transferred from F0 to F1. The fact that F1-AC and F1-AA had similarly 

reduced female investment suggests that their individual fitness was affected on some level, either during 

egg formation (in egg quality) or during embryonic development.  

 Egg number dropped from F0 to F1 for both the acidified and control groups, for reasons that 

are unknown. This overall drop in egg count helps to explain why no significant differences were found 

between F1-CA and F0-CC, as was expected, despite the former clearly exhibited a higher egg 

production regarding F1-CC. The magnitude of decrease between F0 and F1 for both main treatments 

was, however, different. In the acidified group, the mean egg number was reduced by approximately 

20%, while in the control treatment, the decrease was only of 10%.  

 Concerning fecundity, OA did not produce immediate effects (positive or negative) to F0-AA, 

but, in the second generation, a significant decrease was observed for the main acidified treatment. This 

is consistent with a multigenerational study on the copepod Acartia sp., which exhibited a consistent 

decrease on egg hatching success over subsequent generations exposed to high-CO2 (Vehmaa et al., 

2016). Another study, also on a copepod species (i.e. Pseudocalanus acuspes), found that second 

generation adults exhibited a 29% decrease in fecundity at 900 ?atm, compared to control conditions 

(Thor and Dupont, 2015).  



34 

 

 The absence of effects in F0-AA for this reproductive trait suggests that the increased egg 

production was enough to ensure that mean fecundity remained at “normal” or control levels. However, 

increased investment did not result in increased fecundity. In the F1 generation, mean fecundity suffered 

a significant drop, concomitant with the decline in egg investment for the same treatment. It is possible 

that the metabolic costs associated with the accumulated effects of two-generation exposure could have 

led to a temporary shift in the allocation of energy resources that would normally be used for 

reproduction, i.e., the female investment in the number of mature oocytes that are deposited as eggs in 

the brood pouch and, possibly, egg quality (Neuparth et al., 2002). 

 Similar fecundity levels were expected between F0-CC and F1-CA, following the trend 

established by the high-CO2 group in F0 (F0-AA), but this was not the case. Nonetheless, mean fecundity 

was still significantly higher than the same generation’s main acidified treatment (F1 AA), as expected, 

despite being significantly smaller than both CC (F0 and F1) and AA (F0) groups. Maternal cannibalism 

(i.e. during development, when new-born individuals are already capable to enter and exit the brood 

pouch at will) could help explain this apparent disparity. Decreases in pH levels have already been linked 

to an increase in the number of cannibalistic crustacean species in acutely acidified lakes (Havens, 

1991), and cannibalism can also account for a significant portion of mortality rates in G. locusta (Christie 

and Kraufvelin, 2004, Costa et al., 2005) 

 The results also suggest the existence of negative maternal effects regarding fecundity that were 

present in both F1-AA and F1-AC groups. Mean fecundity for F1-AC was significantly reduced when 

compared to this treatment’s parent generation, and just as reduced as F1-AA, and followed the same 

tendency as female investment for the same treatment. Vehmaa (2016), also showed the existence of 

significant negative maternal effects of pH on egg hatching success in Acartia sp.  

 The (~) 10% reduction in the mean number of eggs in the control group from F0 to F1 was not 

followed by a significant reduction in the number of younglings that successfully hatched and reached 

the age of brood-exit. This could be explained by normal female variability in this trait – since females 

that were sampled for egg count were not the same that were sampled for fecundity, as discussed in the 

materials and methods section – and due to the high deviation ranges experienced for both these outputs 

in control.  

 

  6.2.3 Embryonic development  

 

 The duration of embryonic development was unaffected by acidification. There is a lack of 

literary information regarding this particular trait for amphipods, however, in Echinogammarus marinus 

(Leach, 1815), exposure to pH 7.5 resulted in delayed embryonic development at low salinities (22), but 

this effect was absent at 35 (Egilsdottir et al., 2009). Also, similar reductions in pH had no effect on the 

growth rate of juveniles (from adolescence to sexual maturity) in the same species as ours (Hauton et 

al., 2009). It seems plausible that transgenerational exposure to ocean acidification by itself and in a 

reduced number of generations will not produce changes in the development rate of this marine 

amphipod, as it was reported for other invertebrate species - e.g. Saccostrea glomerata (Parker et al., 

2012). It is possible that multigenerational exposure could, however, produce significant effects in the 

duration of embryonic development that have not been triggered by the current experiment duration.  

  

 



35 

 

 

 6.3. Behavioural traits 
 

 The behavioural trials showed, overall, that OA can significantly affect the ability of gammarid 

males to successfully locate and track the origin of female waterborne cues. Males from F1-AA (who 

were 2nd generation-exposed to high-CO2), spent significantly less time (in proportion regarding total 

test time) in the association areas in which the female scent cue was present. On the other hand, males 

from the control condition spent the majority of trial time, on average, in the correct association area 

and hence, exhibiting the normal levels of attraction and cue tracking that would be characterized by 

normal chemosensory reception.  

 The decreased proportion of time spent in the presence of female cues could indicate a decreased 

ability to accurately track and locate the origin of a cue trail in the water column, as has already been 

described for Eurytemora affinis and Temora longicornis (Seuront, 2010). Acidified males did exhibit 

a mean proportion of 50% of the time spent in the correct association area, despite the increased 

deviation range for both treatments. This supports the possibility that males could be unable to detect 

the female pheromones, since this proportion is neither indicative of attraction nor avoidance. The fact 

that there were no statistical differences between F1-AA and F1-CC regarding first-choice means that, 

on average, acidified males can still detect and be positively stimulated by exposure to a female 

pheromone trail. This would suggest that although males exposed to OA are not able to correctly identify 

and track the origin of this cue, they are still being positively stimulated by it to some extent. Also, the 

response time at trial start exhibited by males was also significantly higher under OA. This could suggest 

that such males experienced, in the F1 generation at least, a reduction in stimuli response time linked to 

physiological-induced locomotor impairments.  

 The possibility that using treatment-conditioned water for the behavioural tests would damage 

or degrade the female cues involved in the attraction of males was dismissed. Although the effect of pH 

on signalling molecules in the context of OA has yet to be sufficiently explored on a molecular level 

(Roggatz et al., 2016), so far only in one freshwater system has molecular evidence for cue degradation 

been described, which directly affected individual response to alarm cues – the cue in question being a 

naturally occurring purine derivative, hypoxanthine (Brown et al., 2002). Marine studies involving CO2-

induced acidification and the testing of behavioural responses to olfactory stimuli in fish, showed that, 

in overall, the observed changes were not caused by chemical modification of the odour cues, at least 

for a change in pH levels of approximately 0.5 units (Leduc et al., 2013). Also, aquatic sex pheromones 

that are known to be potentially affected by pH include peptides, nucleosides, thiols and organic acids 

(Hardege et al., 2011), while hormones that are most likely involved in acting as male attractants in long 

distances for gammarid amphipods (like the active moulting hormone 20-OH-ecdysone) belong to the 

steroid compound class (Thummel and Chory, 2002), that are not included in the mentioned hormone 

categories. 

 The present study showed, for the first time, sexually-related chemo-sensory disruption in 

marine amphipods. In marine fish, OA was also responsible for the loss of avoidance behaviour in larvae 

of the anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus to chemical alarm cues, as well as a reversal to the elicited 

response with attraction to this cue (Welch et al., 2014). Yet, such study showed that transgenerational 

acclimation alone was not able to reverse these effects. Further testing on subsequent generations of G. 

locusta is, therefore, important in order to address possible transgenerational effects on this particular 

trait.  



36 

 

 6.4. Metabolism  
 

 Results from the mass-specific RMR analysis showed that mean routine O2 consumption rates 

were significantly reduced in amphipods that had been exposed to high-CO2 for two generations (F1-

AA). This effect can be the direct result of respiratory-stress induced by hypercapnia – abnormally high 

concentrations of dissolved CO2 in the haemolymph (Pörtner et al., 2004). The decrease in extracellular 

pH unbalances the regulation of the intracellular acid-base status in the organism (by slowing down the 

rate of H+ equivalent ion exchange in Na+/H+- and Na+- dependent Cl-/HCO3
- transporters), and when 

uncompensated, this decrease leads to acidosis-induced metabolic depression (Pörtner et al., 2004). 

Metabolic depression is considered as a time-limited adaptation strategy to survive unfavourable 

conditions, such as hypercapnia (Guppy and Withers, 1999), since it reduces the energy requirements 

of acid-base regulation (Pörtner et al., 2004). In many calcifying and non-calcifying marine invertebrates 

tolerant to CO2 oscillations, prolonged high-CO2 exposure has been known to cause drops in metabolic 

rates and even, sometimes a phenomenon similar to anaesthesia (Reipschläger and Pörtner, 1996, 

Pörtner et al., 2004, Michaelidis et al., 2005).  

 By comparing female and male RMR, no significant differences were found which could 

indicate metabolic depression in either sex for each treatment, despite slightly higher values in female 

consumption rates. This is a solid indicator that both males and females are equally subjected to 

metabolic depression as a possible compensation for extracellular acidosis and, thus, are equally 

metabolically affected by pH reductions in the environment. These results help support some of the 

previously stated hypothesis, in which disruption of normal metabolic processes by OA might be playing 

a role in modulating other life-history traits or behaviours.  

 

 

7. Conclusions 
 

 Ocean acidification is a pervasive stressor that will undoubtedly pose risks for marine 

biodiversity in the future. Some marine species will have the ability to adapt to future global change, 

through transgenerational plasticity and epigenetics, but this adaptive potential can be relatively finite, 

due to the presence of evolutionary trade-offs and reduction of extant genetic diversity (Calosi et al., 

2016). Our results highlight the hypothesis that gammarid amphipods, which are commonly considered 

more tolerant than other species to future climate change, are also prone to negative effects of high-CO2. 

A summary of the results of all reproductive, behavioural and metabolic analysis is featured in Table 

7.1. 

 First-exposure individuals showed an increase in female reproductive investment, a reduction 

in MG duration and decreased survival, despite exhibiting normal fecundity levels. The adoption of a 

different reproductive strategy by females, could pose an active response regarding prolonged 

physiological stress, which could aim to maximize genetic variability and thus, the chances that new, 

more adapted phenotypes, could arise. Short-term survival (at 30 days) was also affected, leading to 

survival ratios approximately 19% lower than in control.  

 In marine invertebrates, the maintenance of acid-base balance is an energetically costly process 

that does not occur spontaneously (Pörtner et al., 2004). Previous exposure to reduced pH during growth 

(from juvenile to maturity) for G. locusta has shown an increased and sustained expression of the gapdh

gene (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which suggests that subtle changes in the 

organism’s physiology do take place on OA scenarios (Hauton et al., 2009). This supports the possibility 

that OA, as the organism’s physiology attempts to compensate acid-base balance, is causing some 

important and negative effects on the metabolism of G. locusta, evidenced by changes in mean survival 

and in reproductive traits. In fact, in the second generation, both male and female amphipods suffered 

some degree of metabolic depression, that is thought to constitute a survival enhancing strategy under 

stressful conditions, as it allows an active defence against disturbances in metabolism and tissue 

functioning induced by hypercapnia (Lannig et al., 2010). This result helps to explain the significant 

increase in response time observed in the behavioural trials for high-CO2 exposed males, since metabolic 

depression can be behaviourally expressed as a reduction in activity (anaesthesia). Not only did males 

take more time to react to the female cues, but their preference responses were less clear than males in 

the control group, suggesting that OA is potentially acting as a chemosensory disruptor. Decreased 

metabolic rates could also explain the reduction in MG duration in the first generation, although no 

metabolic data was collected for the parental generation.  Smaller amounts of energy could be available 

for processes other than maintaining metabolism and acid-base balance, which could lead to males 

investing less in the active guarding of females, and potentially reducing the number of successful sexual 

occurrences between mates. Females in F1 also experienced a drop in investment by number of eggs, 

which culminated in reduced progeny.  

 The presence of parental effects was also identified. In female investment, MG, survival and 

even in fecundity, individuals reared in control conditions whose parents came from the acidified 

parental group always exhibited negative tendencies of traits, that either followed the negative trend of 

their parental generation (MG duration and survival) or the trend exhibited by the acidified population 

of the second generation (female investment and fecundity). Although two particular results seemed to 

hint to a possible transgenerational acclimation in F1-AA (MG and survival, specifically), these are most 

likely due to the high deviance range of the data for these outputs in this particular treatment. It could 

be, still, that prolonged transgenerational exposure is indeed acting towards acclimation of the 

population - with the potential genetic variability induced by high female investment in F0-AA – and 

that the high deviation of the data is indeed a sign of this variability.

 Further experimental tests are necessary to improve scientific knowledge towards understanding 

the impacts of OA in amphipod’s biological traits. Not only increasing the number of experimental 

generations, but also complementing these outputs with other useful data that could help shed some light 

on the exact mechanisms that might be at play. First, regarding reproductive trials, it would be important 

to complement female investment (in number) with data on egg quality, size and shape, and following 

embryonic development to address the existence of abnormalities of development in younglings. Mate-

guarding duration should be complemented by a quantitative analysis of successful mate encounters – 

which should be reduced, since high-CO2 negatively affected the ability of males to identify the origin 

or the presence of female cues in the water current. Since males rely on both long and short distance 

chemical cues to track females and initiate MG behaviour, specific tests should be designed to assess 

possible disruption in the detection of contact-pheromones, and in possible modification of the success 

of MG initiation. It is also important to test for chemosensory disruption of other fitness-enhancing 

chemically-based behaviours: i) does OA only affect the detection of sexual cues, or does it disrupt all 

of the amphipod’s chemoreception mechanisms and equally decreases individual’s response to other 

conspecific and heterospecific, or even environmental cues? ii) does OA impair the conspecific 

recognition mechanisms that elicit gregarious behaviours in this species, and, does it decrease the ability 

to detect predator and injured conspecific cues in water-currents - thus increasing mortality by intra- and 

interspecific predation?  

 It is also important to assess whether metabolic depression carries on in subsequent generations, 

and if individual survival is indeed maximized, and amphipods eventually begin to show a positive 

comeback from the apparent negative effect of OA, thus hinting at transgenerational acclimation.  

 Trans- and multigenerational approaches to OA and other stressors, as well as possible 

synergies, in climate-change ecology are fundamental in order to help managers and policy-makers in 

the development of measures towards the protection of global environments. It is only through long-

term experimental evolutionary studies that scientists will be able to accurately understand the expected 

effects of these stressors on different levels of biological organization (i.e. from molecules and cells, to 

communities and ecosystems).
