RESUMO 

A mineralização em ETR da Suíte Intrusiva Ouro Fino permaneceu como um mero ponto 

de ocorrência mineral por décadas. Este trabalho é a primeira abordagem para estudar esta 

mineralização. Através de petrografia, geoquímica, química mineral e difração de raios X, 

este trabalho pôde abordar os principais aspectos geológicos e mineralógicos da Suíte 

Intrusiva Ouro Fino e relacionar a qual mineral estão constritos os ETR. Duas outras suítes 

intrusivas foram identificadas na região: Suíte Intrusiva São Domingos e Suíte Intrusiva 

Costa Marques. Os dados geoquímicos da Suíte Intrusiva Ouro Fino definem-na como 

peralcalina, de caráter alcalino a alcalino-cálcico, e claramente, um granito intraplaca de 

subtipo A2. Teores de óxido de elementos terras raras variaram de 0,47 a 1,65% nas 

amostras analisados, prevalecendo o enriquecimento dos ETRL em relação aos pesados 

(Lan/Ybn ? 8). Junto com os ETR, teores &gt;10.000 ppm de Zr foram identificados nessas 

amostras. As análises de química mineral e petrografia identificaram dois zirconossilicatos 

portadores de ETR: elpidita e zircão. A elpidita é pervasiva em todas as amostras coletadas, 

atigindo até 5% da matriz, já o zircão ocorre ocupando pequenos interstícios da rocha. O 

zircão é o mineral que mais contém ETR em sua estrutura, com teores de óxido de 

elementos terras raras entre 3.2% e 7,4%. Nas análises químicas da elpidita, os teores 

totais de La2O3 + Ce2O3 + Y2O3 variaram de 0,21 a 1,92%. Como mineral acessório de 

ETR, há titanita, com teores de óxidos de ETR no intervalo entre 1,07% e 3,53%. Por serem 

zirconossilicatos, os zircões analisados contêm teores de Zr variando entre 56,1 e 59,8% e 

os cristais de elpidita, estão entre 18,9 e 21%. As suítes intrusivas à Suíte Intrusiva Ouro 

Fino não representaram nenhum tipo de influência à mineralização de ETR-Zr. Os dados 

petrográficos e de química mineral mostram um enriquecimento de sódio no sistema, 

marcado por bordas de reações no anfibólio e albitização moderada dos feldspatos 

potássicos. Este hidrotermalismo sódico gerou também enriquecimento de Ca em cristais 

primários de elpidita. O fracionamento de ETR se deve à incorporação dos mesmos na 

estrutura dos zirconossilicatos e posteriormente precipitação por decréscimo na 

temperatura do sistema. Deste modo, a mineralização da Suíte Intrusiva Ouro Fino 

caracteriza-se por um processo de autometassomatismo. Mineralizações de ETR-Zr em 

granitoides agpaíticos semelhantes à da Suíte Intrusiva Ouro Fino são encontradas nos 

depósitos de Khan Bogd, Khalzan Burgetey e Strange Lake.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Presentation and Objectives 

In accord to the IUPAC, the Rare Earth Elements group is composed of the 15 

lanthanides together with Y and Sc. However, the inclusion of Sc in this concept is still not 

helpful, given the different behavior of Sc in nature (Wall, 2014). Also, the short-life of Pr 

makes this element exceptionally rare in nature, resulting in a group of 15 REE elements, 

composed of 14 lanthanides plus Y (Wall, 2014). 

As a result of the increasing demand for REE in the global markets and the REE 

trade conditions imposed by China, the last decade became a period when several 

exploration projects for REE flourished (Paulick &amp;amp; Machacek, 2017). Among the deposits 

outside China, the main projects are in Canada, Brazil, Greenland and Austrália.  

Brazil has currently eight deposits of REE, being two associated with granitic rocks 

and six with alkaline-carbonatite complexes (Takehara et al, 2016). The alkaline-carbonatite 

complexes sum a total of 261.3 Mt of ore with REE2O3 in a range from 0.7% up to 5.5%, as 

well the granitic REE deposits comprehend a total of 414 Mt of ore, being REE2O3 content 

equal or less than 1% (Takehara et al., 2016). The Rondonian Tin Province also contains in 

the stanniferours greisens with REE mineralization associated (Bettencourt, 1988 and 1991; 

Souza, 2003; Sparrenberger, 2002; Buch et al., 2016). However, information about the ore 

grades from these deposits is no quite precise. Among the REE ores associated with 

granites described by Takehara, the one from Costa Marques was the least known. The 

REE occurrence of Costa Marques is related to the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (Buch et al, 

2018). 

The existence of REE mineralization in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (OFIS) is 

known since the project developed by Torres et al. (1978). After some mineral exploration 

follow-up made by Costa (1990) in the area, nothing had been developed in the region 

anymore. Because of the strong demand for REE, new sources for these elements must be 

explored. Therefore, some research to avail the potential of the OFIS for REE was required. 

This project is the first investigation to comprehend the mineralization of Costa Marques. 

The scope of this project comprises an integration of petrographic, petrological and 

mineralogical studies that aim to characterize the REE mineralization from the OFIS.

1.2. Location 

The area of study locates in the southwestern border of the state of Rondônia with 

Bolívia. The reference city for support and logistic is Costa Marques. The access to Costa 

Marques is made from Porto Velho by the national highway BR-364 until the intersection 

with the national highway BR-429, that ends in the city of Costa Marques. 

From Costa Marques to the study area, there are two entrances known as “km 22” 

and “km 26”. Counting from the city of Costa Marques, they respectively are 22 and 26 km 

away on the left side of the BR-429. The location of the study area is known in the region as 

Serra Grande Hill (Fig 1.1).

Rondonia with Bolivia. Main accesses to the Ouro Fino Inrusive Suiute domain are in the intersection 
of the federal road with the km-22 and km-26 entrances.

2. METHODOLOGY 

2.1. Mapping and Sampling 

For the studies of this project, a field survey was made in the area during the second 

half of July 2016, in the dry season. A total of 42 spots were described and 29 samples had 

been collected. The location of sampling spots is in Appendix 2.  

The fieldwork data was compiled and interpreted in association with SRTM data 

provided by the National Institute of Space Research and geophysical data provided from 

the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM, 2010). The result of this interpration is a geological 

map in the 1:50,000 scale (Fig. 4.2). 

2.2. Geochemistry  

The chemical analyses for bulk-rock chemistry were executed by the ALS Global 

laboratory in Brazil. From the 29 collected samples, only 18 samples did not present to be 

weathered to be chemically analysed. In the set of analysed samples, 13 are from the Ouro 

Fino Intrusive Suite, 2 from the Sao Domingos Intrusive Suite and 3 from the Costa Marques 

Intrusive Suite. The location and type of the respective analysed samples are available in 

Table 8 of Appendix 2.  

The techniques applied to analyse major elements and ICP-AES with preparation 

and for trace and rare earth elements, ICP-MS. Samples were analysed in laboratory ALS 

Global, using the Service Packs ME-ICP06 for ICP-AES and ME-MS81 for REE and trace 

elements. Samples for ICP-AES were prepared using funded lithium borate beads with acid 

digestion and for ICP-AES, the digestion was multiacid. More details about the analalytical 

proceeding can be found in the ALS-Global analytical schedule (ALS Global, 2018). 

2.3. Rock powder X-Ray Diffraction 

The samples CM-31 and CM-39 were assayed under the technique X-ray 

diffraction of rock powder. The analyses were performed by ALS Chemex laboratory using 

a Bruker D8 Focus Bragg-Brentano diffractometer with a tube of cobalt. The range of 2? 

was between 2º and 70º, with a theta step size of 0.1º and an analysis speed of 1.2 s per 

step. The mineral composition was determined by the diffractometric results using the 

Rietveld method. The X-Ray Diffraction analyitical package to identify bulk-rock mineralogy 

in ALS Global is known as XRDSQ (ALS Global, 2018) 



4 
 

2.4. Mineral Chemistry 

The mineral chemistry analysis had been made over thin sections of 8 samples from 

riebeckite-alkali feldspar granites. To identify the minerals that contain REE elements, the 

chosen technique is the electron microprobe analyzer (EPMA). Among the 8 samples, the 

samples were analyzed in the laboratory for electron microprobe analyzer from the German 

Geological Survey (BGR). The other 4 samples were analyzed in the laboratory for electron 

microbrobe of the Geosciences Institute of the University of Brasília (LME-IG).  

The analyzed elements in the laboratory of electron microprobe of the BGR were 

Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe2+, Fe3+, Sr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, and Hf.  The targeted minerals 

were amphiboles, pyroxenes, titanite, zircon, and elpidite. For the assays, a JEOL JXA-

8530F was utilized. The analysis conditions occurred with a sample current of 40 nA and 

voltage acceleration of 20kV.  The utilized lines are K? – Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, and K with 

10 s of peak measuring time; K? – Ti, with 20 s of peak measuring time; K? – Mn, with 30 s 

of peak measuring time; L? – Sr and Y, 30 s of peak measuring time; L? – Zr, with 60 s of 

measuring time; L? – La, with 60 s of measuring time; L? – Ce with 50 s of peak measuring 

time and;  L? – Hf, with 50 s of peak measuring time. The standards utilized were diopside 

(Mg and Ca); jadeite (Al, Si, Na), rutile (Ti), rhodonite (Mn), almandine (Fe), orthoclase (K), 

synthetic zirconia (Y, Hf), coelestine (Sr), zircon (Zr) and monazite (La, Ce).  

In the LME-IG, the utilized device was a JEOL JXA-8230. For the analyses, three different 

proceedings were developed. One was specific for (i) major elements on amphiboles and 

pyroxenes, one was for (ii) major elements of potential REE minerals and the last, (iii) for 

REE elements on amphiboles, pyroxenes, and potential REE minerals. 

- (i) for the pyroxenes and amphiboles, the analysed elements are F, Al, Si, Ca, 

K, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Ni, Fe, V, and Ba. The assay utilized a sample current of 

10 nA and voltage acceleration of 15 kV. The utilized lines are K? – Na, F, Al, 

Si, Ca, K, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Fe, and V; L? – Ba, Sr.  

- (ii) in the potential REE minerals, the analysed major elements are F, Al, Si, P, 

Nb, Mn, Ti, Y, Ta, Ca, Fe and Zr. The applied sample current was 10 nA and the 

voltage acceleration 15 kV. The employed lines for the elements are K? – F, Al, 

Si, P, Mn, and Ti; L? – Y; K? – Ca; and L? – Nb.  



5 
 

- (iii) in the assays for REE, Na, K, U, Th and Ba were analysed as well. The 

analyses were conducted with voltage acceleration of 20 kV and sample current 

of 50 nA. To analyse Na and K, the K? line was utilized. Lantanium, Ce, Nd, Eu, 

Gd, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and Ba were analised on the L? line. For Ta, the applied line 

was M?.  

For the analyses on pyroxenes and amphiboles, the standards used are: albite 

(Na), forsterite (Mg), topaz (F), microcline (Al, K and Si), MnTiO3 (Mn and Ti), andradite (Ca 

and Fe), vanadinite (Cl and V), Cr2O3 (Cr), NiO (Ni), SrSO4 (Sr, BaSo4 (Ba). 

In the analyses of REE minerals, the standards utilized in the assays are: topaz 

(F), microcline (Al, K and Si), apatite (P and Ca), LiNbO3 (Nb), MnTiO3 (Mn and Ti), 

YFe2O12 (Y), LiTaO3 (Ta), andradite (Fe), baddeyleite (Zr), albite (Na), vanadinite (Pb); 

ThO2 (Th), SrSO4 (Sr), CeO2 (Ce), UO2, BaSO4 (Ba). For for the REE, the glasses REE-

1 (Eu, Gd, Tb, Tm), REE-2 (Sm, Nd, Yb, Lu), REE-3 (La and Pr) and REE-4 (Dy, Ho, Er). 

The electron beam diameter was 1 µm, and the peak measuring time of 10 s in the 

peak and 5 s in the background. 

3. SYNTHESIS OF REGIONAL GEOLOGY KNOWLEDGE  

3.1. Geotectonic Context 

The studied area situates at the extreme southwest border of the Amazonian 

Craton. In this region, the Amazonian Craton comprehends two geochronolocail provinces 

(Tassinari &amp;amp; Macambira, 1999). The former, is the Rondonian-San Ignacio, with ages 

between 1.55 to 1.3 Ga and the subsequent, is the Sunsás Province, with ages between 1.3 

to 1.0 Ga. Accordingly to Bettencourt et al. (2010), the Rondonian-San Ignácio Province is 

bordered to the north and east by the Rio Negro-Juruena Province and to the south, is 

bounded by the Sunsás Province.  

The Rondonian-San Ignacio Province comprises a geological set resulted from an 

orogeny involving the amalgamation of the Paraguá Terrane to other domains composed by 

the Rio Crespo Intrusive Suite (1.5 Ga), Rio Alegre Complex (1.51 – 1.48), Santa Helena 

batholith (1.45 – 1.42 Ga), Colorado Metamorphic Complex (1.36 – 1.3 Ga) and 

Pensamiento Granitoid Complex (1.36 – 1.30 Ga) (Cordani &amp;amp; Teixeira, 2007; Bettencourt et 

al., 2010) . 



6 
 

In accord with the map of Rizzotto et al., (2013) the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is 

inserted in the Guaporé Suture Zone (Fig. 3.1). The Guaporé Suture is the result of the 

amalgamation of the Paraguá Terrane with the Amazonian Craton (Rizzotto et al., (2013). 

The evolution of this suture zone included the generation of ultramafic magmatism followed 

the deformation of oceanic crust and supracrustal rocks and granitogeneses during the 

collisional phase (Rizzotto et al., 2013). The Trincheira Complex represents the ophiolitic 

crust formed between 1470 and 1435 Ma and the Colorado Metamorphic Complex is the 

supracrustal rocks group deposited over the Trincheira Complex. The metamorphism of the 

Colorado Metamorhic Complex took place around 1350 to 1330 Ma. 

Occurying in the centre-north of Rondonia, the intrusive suites Santo Antônio (1,41 

Ga), Teotônio (1.39 Ga), Alto Candeias (1.34 Ga) and São Lourenço-Caripunas (1.3 Ga) 

were associated to late to post-tectonic magmatism related to the Rondonian-San Ignacio 

(Bettencourt et al., 2010). 

Within the Guaporé Suture Zone, Rizzotto (2010) present two intrusive suites of 

ages around 1.3 – 1.4 Ga. The Igarapé Enganado (1.36 Ga) and Alto Escondido (1.34) 

intrusive suites are the result of late to post-colisional magmatism inside the Guaporé Suture 

Zone. The plutonism of these suites is correlated to the plutonism resulted from the 

Rondonian-San Ignacio events in other regions of Rondonia (Gilmar José Rizzotto, 2010). 

The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite was only recently discovered (Bettencourt et al., 

2012). For several years, the only dated magmatism in the studied area was from the Costa 

Marques Group, around 1.0 Ga (Torres et al., 1979). The magmatism of the Costa Marques 

Group was associated with the Sunsas Geochronoligical Province and correlate to the 

Rondonian Intrusive Suite, both result of post-collisional plutonism (Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto, 

2007). Since new data have been presented, new interpreations are necessary to come. 

However, there is still no work interpreting the origin of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

magmatism face the regional deformatinal events of the Rondonian-San Ignacio Province.

Guaporé Suture Zone in accord to Rizzotto et al. (2013). Figure adapted from Rizzotto et al. (2013). 

3.2. Previous Works 

The first reports about the geology of the region were written by Lobato  et al. (1966). 

Subsequently, the projects Southwest of Rondônia (Torres, 1979) and the RADAM Brasil – 

Quadricule Guaporé SD.20 (Santos et al., 1979) developed recognisement studies in the 

region. The former was on 1:500,000 scale and the last, 1: 1,000,000.

During the 1980’s, the Geological Survey of Brazil, formely called CPRM, developed 

studies to identify areas with metalogenetic potential (Freitas et al., 1985). Afterwards, Costa 

(1990) developed an exploration survey for REE in the Serra Grande Hill, which is the work 

that identifies the potential for REE in the Serra Grande Hill. 

Other studies improved the knowledge about the geological background in the area 

(Scandolara,1999; Rizzotto et al., 2004; Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto, 2007). However, these works 

were developed on a regional scale and did not discuss specifically the granitic rocks from 

the southwestern border of Rondonia State. 

Not long ago, Bettencourt et al. (2012) redefined the framework of the granites from 

Costa Marques. As well other further studies regarding the lithogeochemistry and Hf- 

isotopes geochemistry of granites from Costa Marques were published recently (PayollaI et 

al., 2013; Bettencourt et al., 2014).  

3.3. Regional Geology 

Initially, the most ancient rocks in the region were defined by Torres et al. (1979) 

and Santos et al. (1979). However, the following studies on the regional background of 

Scandolara (1999) and Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto (2007) contradicted the proposed ages and 

tectonic events that occurred in this region at the beginning and end of the Neoproterozoic. 

With the airborne geophysical surveys contracted by the CPRM and the 

geochronological analyzes published in other articles, it became possible to advance the 

understanding of the tectonic limits in the studied region. In this way, the units will be 

described in the sequence of the most recent stratigraphy, but the older terms will be 

mentioned since the basement rocks in this part of the state of Rondônia still need more 

detailed geochronological studies. 

3.3.1. Colorado Metamorphic Complex 

The Colorado Metamorphic Complex (CMC) is an association of 

metavulcanosedimentary rocks by Rizzotto et al. (2007) near Colorado do Oeste - RO. 

According to the authors, this association of rocks is subdivided into four lithophacities: 

Metapelitic Unit, Metapsytic Unit, Iron-Manganese Unit and Calcissilictic Unit. The existence 

of these rocks as a basement of the studied area is defined by Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto (2007) 

and was defined through the interpretation of tectonic limits interpreted from 



9 
 

aerogeophysical data. Torres et al. (1979) called the metamorphic rocks intruded by the 

former Costa Marques Complex as Serra dos Reis Unit. Hence, in order to seek a 

concordance that eliminates this hiatus on the geological knowledge, the subdivisions of the 

Colorado Complex defined by Rizzotto et al. 2007) will be described and followed by the 

Serra dos Reis Unit mentioned by Torres et al. (1979). According to Rizzotto et al. (2007), 

the CMC rocks were formed in a regional metamorphic event, of medium amphibolite facies 

3.3.1.1. Metapelitic Unity 

The metapelitic unit of the Colorado Metamorphic Complex is formed by elongated 

and sigmoidal lenses of metric length or, that could reach up to 25 km. The lithotypes that 

compose it are muscovite-biotite-quartz schists, granada-silimanite-biotite schists, 

silimanite-staurolite-biotite schists, silimanite-staurolite-biotite-quartz schists and locally, 

graphite-schists. Cutting these rocks, there are veins of quartz with blasts of subhedral 

muscovite. 

The fabric of these rocks contrives a crenulated schistosity, indicating at least two 

deformations. The mesoscopic-scale crenulations are indicated by isoclinal and intrafolial 

folds, with or without roots. 

Hosted in these rocks, there are pockets of granitic composition (neosomas) parallel 

to sigmoid schistosity. Porphyroblasts of aluminous minerals such as grenade and 

subordinately staurolite are common and have their origin possibly associated with contact 

metamorphism. As well, there are porphyroblasts of grenade parallell to the main foliation. 

3.3.1.2. Metapsamitic Unity 

This unit is composed by migmatitic gneisses and occurs interbedded with the 

metapelitics and paraderivated units. The migmatization is indicated by pods and lenses of 

granitic leucosoma (neosoma). The neosome lenses are concordant with the 

banding/foliation of gneisses. The petrography indicates that the origins of these gneisses 

are from pure and impure sandstones (metarkoses). The sillimanite and cordierite of these 

rocks indicate high grade metamorphism. 

The felsic layers vary between 1.0 and 1.5 mm in thickness and the mafic layers 

vary between 1.0 and 3.0 mm. These layers have isoclinal and intrafolial folds with root, 



10 
 

defined by the folding of aggregates of biotite and sillimanite; thus indicating at least two 

deformations. 

3.3.1.3. Ferro-Manganesiferous Unity 

The occurrence of this unit is irregular and discontinuous. The foliation is parallel to 

the foliation of the units mentioned above. This unit is composed of layers of metacherts 

intercalated with layers of iron and manganese oxides. Among these layers, there may be 

amphibolites, schists and associated paragneisses. The most frequent lithotypes are 

magnetite-metachert, hematite-quartzite and ferruginous quartzite. These layers of silica 

and oxides of iron and manganese have thicknesses ranging from millimeters to 

centimeters. 

3.3.1.4. Calcissilicatic Unity 

Discontinuous lenses of calcissilicatic gneiss are generally intercalated with 

amphibolites. They have a constricted to the extreme northwest of Pimenteiras city. The 

constituent minerals are diopside, plagioclase, quartz and, to a lesser extent, granade. 

These minerals are segregated in layers of millimetric thickness, defining the foliation of the 

rock. 

3.3.1.5. Paramphibolite Unity 

This unit is associated with calcissilictic gneisses and occurs as narrow and 

elongated layers of very local occurrence. It is dark gray in color and fine grained. The fabric 

is composed of centimetri-decimetric layers of amphibole texture nematoblastic cut by 

quartz venules parallel to the foliation. According to Rizzotto et al. (2007), the CMC rocks 

were formed in a regional metamorphic event, of medium amphibolite facies. 

3.3.1.6. The Serra dos Reis Unity 

As mentioned previously, Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto (2007) defined the Colorado 

Metamorphic Complex as the country rock for the granites of Costa Marques.  Concordant 

to these authors, the Colorado Metamorphc Complex is the same group of metamorphic 

rocks denominated Serra dos Reis Unity, by Torres et al. (1978).  

Torres describes the Serra dos Reis Unity as na elongated hill striking E-W, at NE 

of Costa Marques city. It occurs also as inselbergs in the Guaporé River’s flood plain. 



11 
 

The Serra dos Reis Unity is formed byt metarenites, metarkoses, and quartzites. 

Locally, there are conglomeratic meta-arkoses, fine-grained metarenites and purple phylites 

(Torres et al., 1979).  

Torres et al. suggest the probable age for the Serra dos Reis Unity is between 1.8 

and 1.5 Ga. However, Scandolara (1999) infers that the Serra dos Reis Unity could be part 

of the Nova Brasilândia Metavolcanosedimentary Sequence, with age of 1.177±33 Ma 

(Rb/Sr bulk rock). In accord with Rizzotto et al. (2010), the Colorado Metamorphic Complex 

has ages between 1312±3Ma and 1303±2Ma (Ar/Ar in biotite of anatexites).  

For the description of the Colorado Metamorphic Complex and its correlate Serra 

dos Reis Unity, its assumed that the Serra dos Reis Unity corresponds to the metapsamitic 

unity of Rizzotto et al. (2007). 

3.3.2. Costa Marques Complex: three alkaline intrusive suítes 

The first mention of Costa Marques granites was made by Lobato et al. (1966), while 

reporting rocks near the Príncipe da Beira Fortress The authors describe rocks with 

porphyritic texture and probably mineralized to cassiterite. Santos et al. (1978) define as 

Costa Marques Group porphyritic granites and as well, rhyolites, andesites, tufts, porphyry 

quartz, granites and granophyres, that appear near the homonymous region. According to 

these authors, "lithotypes are extremely differentiated going mainly from acid to 

intermediate, as well as some mafic local exposures. Santos et al. (1978) reportes the most 

complete description of the rocks associate to the Costa Marques Group, which is 

summarized below:     

3.3.2.1. Granites 

Granites are the most abundant lithotypes in the Costa Marques Group. They are 

of phaneritic texture, generally medium to coarse grained, sometimes porphyritic. The 

granites present brown, pink and gray coloration, and sometimes presenting dark or 

greenish spots and a leucocratic color index. 

In micropetrography, there is micropertitic intergrowth in the feldspars (hypersolvus). 

The habit of these crystals is anhedral to subhedral, occurring Albite or Carlsbad twinnings. 

The quartz crystals are of anhedral, with fractured edges, and sometimes with undulating 



12 
 

extinction. Myrmequite intergrowth between quartz crystals and feldspars is another 

common feature. 

The biotite crystals vary from green to brown, with strong pleochroism. These 

crystals are distributed in lamellae and replace the hornblende. Inclusions of zircon are rare. 

The amphibole occurs in two varieties, hornblende and biotite. The hornblende is of 

tabular form, with euhedral crystals. Riebeckite occurs as tabular crystals or sub-radiated 

aggregates of very small prisms. These crystals are intensely pleochroic, with the color 

varying from dark blue to yellowish green. Other minerals that make up the rock are opaque 

and titanite anhedral, zircon in tiny euhedral prisms, fluorite, alannite in more developed 

euhedral crystals and apatite. As altering minerals occupying mainly fractures, there are 

sericite, leucoxene, clay-minerals, chlorite, epidote-zoisite and iron oxides. 

3.3.2.2. Granophyres 

In accord to Santos et al. (1978), the granophyres are rocks with "pinkish-gray” 

coloration, porphyritic texture with a microphaneritic matrix. The rock has a massive 

structure and is consisted essentially of quartz, feldspar, epidote or mafic mineralss. 

Under the microscope, not all the samples studied by these authors revealed 

phenocrysts. These samples without phenocrysts showed a microfaneritic texture, with an 

incipient finer granulation than porphyritic granophyres. Feldspar phenocrysts can reach 2.5 

cm length and form clusters resulting in a glomeroporphyrytic texture. Opaque minerals are 

abundant and appear as altered or disseminated mineral clusters in the matrix. As accessory 

minerals, there are apatite and zircon in the form of small euhedral crystals. Rarely, there is 

biotite, which is sometimes chloritized. 

The alteration minerals are chlorite and epidote. The chlorite occurs in the form of 

lamellar and fibrorradial aggregates; and the epidote in small crystal agglomerates.  

3.3.2.3. Syenytes 

Syenites are scarce in the Costa Marques Group. They are coloured brown, 

medium-coarse grained, and are essentially composed of orthoclase, microcline, 

plagioclase and hornblende. In micropetrography, it is possible to observe cataclastic 

deformation in the crystals with undulating extinction, marginal microgranulation (generation 

of subgrains), curved geminations and mineral comminution with faceted subgrains. 



13 
 

3.3.2.4. Rhyolites 

Rhyolites are of reddish-brown to yellow-brown coloration, with fine granulation, 

porphyritic texture with matrix varying from aphanitic to microphaneritic. The constituent 

minerals are mainly quartz and K-feldspar. 

In micropetrography, phenocrysts of feldspar and quartz vary from anhedral to 

euhedral are surrounded by a spherulitic matrix composed of feldspar and fibroradiated 

cristobalite. In the matrix, there are also opaque minerals, epidote and chlorite. The quartz 

phenocrystalls present corroded edges. Feldspars present Albite and Carlsbad twinnings. 

Perttitic intergrowth is observed as a result of the occurrence of plagioclase associated with 

potassic feldspar. As accessory minerals, there are zircon and titanite. 

3.3.2.5. Rhyodacites and tuffs 

These rocks are the most abundant of the Costa Marques Group, in accord to 

Santos et al. (1978). The rhyodacites present greenish gray colours, with porphyritic texture, 

aphanitic matrix and massive structure. 

Under the microscope, the phenocrystalls are mostly feldspar (microcline and 

plagioclase) and subordinately, clinopyroxene. These phenocrysts are immersed in a fine-

grained matrix composed essentially of quartz and feldspars. In addition, the matrix is also 

composed of chlorite, epidote, opaque minerals and more rarely, volcanic glass.  When 

associated with K-feldspar, plagioclase occurs micropertitic intergrowth. 

The clinopyroxene phenocrystalls are anhedrical sometimes altered to epidote or 

chlorite. Quartz crystals form an intergrowth with the feldspars. Eventually, there is still 

cryptocrystalline silica in the form of spherulites also associated with feldspars. Opaque 

minerals are quite numerous, in the form of tiny disseminated crystals or aggregates. 

Titanite, zircon and apatite are in trace quantities. Chlorite and epidote occur in large 

amounts possibly resulted from alteration processes. 

The rhyodacitic tuff under naked eye is a rock of dark gray color, porphyritic texture 

and aphanitic matrix with massive structure. Its main constituents are mafic minerals, 

feldspar and quartz. In the microscope, there are fragments of basaltic rock and phenocrysts 

of quartz and feldspar. The matrix consists of feldspar, quartz and volcanic glass. 



14 
 

3.3.2.6. Trachytes 

The trachytes exhibit gray color, with porphyritic texture and aphanitic matrix. Are 

composed essentially by mafic minerals and K-feldpsar. In microscopic scale, the K- 

feldspar (orthoclase), is scattered in the matrix beside aegirine crystals. The main 

phenocrysts are the orthoclase with pertitic intergrowth. As for accessories, the rock 

presents opaque minerals, zircon, titanite, quartz and apatite.  

3.3.2.7. Andesites 

Quite common, in the Group Costa Marques, the andesites prevail over 

leucoandesitos. The color varies from pink to dark gray, and the colour index varies from 

leucocratic to melanocratic. The texture is usually unequigranular, with aphanitic matrix and 

feldspar phenocrysts. Less frequent are the rocks with aphanitic or fine phaneritic textures. 

The main constituent minerals are plagioclase, biotite and amphibole. 

In the micropetrography, feldspars are predominantly identified as plagioclase, 

which is moderately sericitized, with antipertitites, subhedral habit, and Albite and Carlsbad-

type geminations. The identified member of the plagioclase series is andesine. In the matrix 

there is also chlorite, resulted from the biotite and hornblende alteration. Quartz when 

observed, is of anhedral habit and undulating extinction. Minerals identified accessories are 

opaque minerals, zircon, apatite, titanite, epitope and subordinately rutile. 

3.3.2.8. Reclassifications and Geological Knowledge Update  

After Santos et al. (1978), Torres et al. (1978) defined the Costa Marques Group as 

Costa Marques Complex, a denomination that has been preserved until the work of 

Bettencourt et al. (2012). These authors subdivided the Costa Marques Complex into three 

distinct magmatic suites: two plutonic and one subvolcanic. Concordant to Bettencourt et al. 

(2012), the first plutonic suite contrives gray aegirina-augita-riebeckita quartz-syenites and 

alkali-feldspar granites. The second plutonic suite characterized by Bettencourt et al. (2012) 

is composed of pink-coloured hornblende-biotite sienogranites with medium to coarse 

granulation and porphyritic or seriate textures and, gray biotite alkali-feldspar granites of 

fine-medium granulation. Still, according to those authors, the subvolcanic suite features 

hornblende-porphyrus porphyry and hornblende porphyry rhyolites, with banded or massive 

structures. 



15 
 

These suites were named by Bettencourt et al. (2012) as Intrusive Suite São 

Domingos, Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, with the concept of Costa Marques Suites, just a sub-

suite. Payolla et al. (2013) classified these suites as alkaline-alkali suites, alkaline to 

metaluminous, and sodium and potassium affinity. According to these authors, the intrusive 

suites have geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. 

The first ages of the Costa Marques Group were obtained by Santos et al. (1979), 

as providing an isochron of Rb/Sr with an age of 962 ± 72 Ma, in bulk rock analysis. This 

age off the Costa Marques Group to be correlated to the magmatism of the Rondônia 

Intrusive Suite. Much later, Bettencourt et al. (2012) analyzed U/Pb in zircons through 

SHRIMP technique and obtained three distinct ages, what resulted in the discrimination of 

three magmatic suites of the region. These authors conclude that the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite is the earliest, with 1347 ± 9Ma. The São Domingos Intrusive Suite is the subsequent 

magmatism with an age of 1057 ± 10 Ma and, lastly, the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite with 

an age of 998 ± 10 Ma. 

3.3.3. Guaporé Formation 

Although of wide extension (Quadros &amp;amp; Rizzotto, 2007), the Cenozoic sedimentary 

and lateritic covers are little discriminated against each other in previous studies. In general, 

the cenozoic covers are associated with the geomorphological landscape of the Guaporé 

River Valley. The Guaporé Formation comprises unconsolidated sediments deposited in the 

alluvial plain of the homonymous river (Figueiredo et al.,1974, apud Santos et al., 1978). 

These authors correlate the Guaporé Formation with the Pantanal Formation, in the state of 

Mato Grosso, and divide it into two subtypes: lower and higher. 

The lower level is determined as "unconsolidated lateritized clayish-arenous 

sediments” that occur in the non-flooded part of the plain. However, Torres et al. (1978) 

observed that the lateritization processes are much more prominent and describe 

ferruginous crusts with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 40 meters. These laterites are 

generally with continuous horizons with concretionary and/or pisolithic matrix. 

The upper layer comprises the layers of sediment still depositing at the adjacent to 

the Guaporé River rails and its tributaries channels. According to Torres et al. (1978), this 

upper layers form terraces on the banks of the rivers of the region, or islands or sand banks. 

These authors observe that the types of sediments are variable, existing clay with or without 



16 
 

organic matter to coarse gravel. These characteristics are typical of meandering river 

environments. 

Torres et al. (1978) propose a more consistent discrimination by differentiating the 

upper level in two groups of sedimentary deposits. The first group consists only of alluvial 

and fluvial sedimentary deposits associated with the banks and beds of the perennial rivers 

of the region. The second is related to eluvio-coluvial sediments, resulting from the lateral 

erosion of the escarpments of the Uopianes Hills, at the north of the studied area.

4.1. Abstract 

 The alkaline granites of the southwest of southwest Rondonia, Brazil are known for high 

concentrations of REE. This study is the first approach to understand the REE mineralization of the 

Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. This suite is composed of a hypersolvus peralkaline alkali feldspar granite. 

The mafic minerals are essentially sodic amphiboles and pyroxenes. Petrographical results indicate 

little mineralogical variation within the alkali feldspar granites. Associated with the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite, late-magmatic alkali-rhyolite dykes occur. Unexpectedly, other plutonic rocks from Costa 

Marques and São Domingos intrusive suites occur in the studied local. The geochemical data 

identified total rare earth contents in the whole rock ranging from 0.47 up to 1.65%, and average 

Lan/Ybn ? 8. Also, high contents of Zr were identified in all the samples, eventually exceeding the 

upper limit of detection. The mineral chemistry results in EPMA identified zircon and elpidite as the 

main carriers of Zr and REE, and subordinately, titanite. The borders of amphiboles are rimmed by 

aegirine. As well, small crystals of Na-plagioclase formed on the edges of microcline crystals, which 

suggests that late magmatic processes occurred. The elpidite is considered as one of the minerals 

that incorporated Ca ions during hydrothermal-deuteric processes. Zircon crystals show a mantle of 

amorphous cryptocrystalline mass rich in REE. The other intrusive suites that occur in the area 

presented no characteristic that could be regarded to the mineralization. The REE-Zr mineralization 

is considered as a result of late-magmatic hydrothermal metasomatism followed by the cooling of 

the hydrothermal system. The incorporation of REE in the lattice of zirconsilicates is the main 

concentration factor as well, as REE concentrated by precipitation in the interstices of the rock. The 

REE-Zr mineralization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suites present mineralogical and petrological 

characteristics similar to the Strange Lake and Khan Bogd deposits.

4.2. Introduction 

In the last 25 years, the importance of rare-earth elements (REE) staggered. Being 

essential to the technology industry, the REE deposits became strategic, which resulted in 

a rush for new deposits. Several deposits of REE have been associated with alkaline 

granites and within-plate geological setting (Wall, 2014; Dostal et al, 2017; 

Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev, 2012). The Rondônia State, in western Brazil, hosts several 

REE-anomalous alkaline granitic suites, which may contain Sn, W, Nb-Ta and F 

mineralization and gemstones (Isotta et al. 1978, Betencourt et al. 1999, Quadros and 

Rizzotto, 2007). The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is located on the southwest side of the 

Rondônia State, very close to the border between Brazil and Bolivia (Fig. 4.1).  

 

Figure 4.1: Location of the area of study and the vicinal geologyt. Figure extracted from Payolla et 
al. (2013) and adapted for this work. 

It has an alkaline geochemical signature and displays REE enrichments (Freitas et 

al. 1985). The later characteristic led to detailed research on the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

through an exploration project with soil and rock sampling conducted by the Geological 

Survey of Brazil - CPRM (Costa, 1990). The exploration survey executed by the CPRM 

indicated “frequent geochemical anomalies of Y, La, Zr and Ti” (Costa, 1990). Lately, a study 

of revaluation of soil samples and airborne geophysical modelling (Buch et al., 2018) 

identified anomalous contents of La, Nd, Yb and Y in the soil and a positive correlation of 

this anomalies with U and Th detected in aerogeophysical surveys. This study has inferred 

the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as a high potential to become a REE deposit. 



20 
 

In this paper, we present new data about petrography, geochemistry and REE-

mineralogy features of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, aiming to advance in the petrological 

investigation on this new target for REE in the Amazonian craton, Brazil.  

4.3. Geological Setting 

The State of Rondônia, located on the SW border of the Amazonian Craton, Brazil, 

hosts several Meso- to Neoproterozoic alkaline (A-type) granitic complexes, representing 

A-type and within-plate to post-collisional geochemical signatures, which were emplaced 

during successive magmatic episodes that occurred between 1,606 and 974 Ma (Priem et 

al., 1971, Isotta et al., 1978, Bettencourt et al., 1999, Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007). Close 

to the southwest border of the Rondônia State, three A-type granite associations were 

discriminated in recent studies (Bettencourt et al, 2012): Ouro Fino, São Domingos and 

Costa Marques intrusive suites. The available data place the Colorado Metamorphic 

Complex as the regional basement (Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007) for those rocks. 

4.3.1. Colorado Metamorphic Complex 

Colorado Metamorphic Complex is a metasedimentary sequence, formed by 

metapelitic, metapsammitic, meta-sandstones and meta-arkoses, ferrous-manganesiferous 

and calcissilicatic rocks (Rizzotto et al., 2007). Subordinately occur meta-conglomerates and 

phyllites (Torres et al, 1979; Quadros and Rizzotto, 2007). The Colorado Metamorphic 

Complex is the supracrustal set of rocks associated with the Alto Guaporé fold belt, an 

orogeny correlated to the Rondonian-San Ignácio Province (Rizzotto et al., 2014; 

Bettencourt et al., 2010).  

4.3.2. The Three Alkaline Intrusive Suites  

The Costa Marques Complex (Torres et al. 1978) was first named as Costa Marques 

Granite (Lobato 1966) and later named as Costa Marques Group (Santos et al. 1978). It is 

composed of porphyritic granites, rhyolites, andesites, tuffs, quartz porphyries, granites and 

granophyres. According to Bettencourt et al. (2012), the Costa Marques Complex can be 

divided into three alkaline granitic suites: two plutonic and one subvolcanic. The oldest 

plutonic suite is composed of aegirine-augite-riebeckite quartz-syenites and alkali feldspar 

granites. The second plutonic suite is composed hornblende-biotite syenogranites with 

medium-coarse grained matrix and porphyritic to seriate texture. The subvolcanic suite 

presents porphyritic hornblende-trachyte and hornblende-rhyolites. These suites were 



21 
 

denominated by Bettencourt et al. (2012) as Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, São Domingos 

Intrusive Suites and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, respectively. From the former Costa 

Marques Complex, for Costa Marques Intrusive Suite remained only the volcanic lithotypes. 

Payolla et al. (2013) classified these three igneous suites as an alkali to alkali-calcic, 

peralkaline to metaluminous, with sodium-potassic affinity. In consonance with these 

authors, the three igneous suites of Costa Marques feature geochemical characteristics of 

A-type granites. 

The first geochronological data for the former Costa Marques Complex were 

obtained by Santos et al. (1979), which provided an isochronous of Rb/Sr at the age of 962 

± 72 Ma. With this age, the authors correlated the Costa Marques magmatism to the 

Rondonia Intrusive Suite magmatism (“Young Granites of Rondônia”). Long after, 

Bettencourt et al. (2012) obtained new ages by analyzing U/Pb in zircons using the SHRIMP 

method. The results yield three different ages, permitting to discriminate three magmatic 

suites in the region. These authors conclude that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is older, with 

1347 ± 9 Ma, the São Domingos Intrusive Suite is the subsequent magmatism at the age of 

1057 ± 10 Ma and finally, the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite at the age of 998 ± 10 Ma. 

Coeval to the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite magmatism were two other important 

regional events: the magmatism of the Alto Candeias Intrusive Suite and the metamorphic 

peak of the Guaporé Fold Belt (Rizzotto et al., 2013). The Alto Candeias batholith is a 

subalkaline suite composed of amphibole-biotite syenogranites, biotite-syenogranites and 

some charnockites (Bettencourt et al., 1999). According to Bettencourt et al. (1999), U-Pb 

in zircos yielded ages between 1346 ± 5 and 1309 ± 9 Ma, which are correlated to “an 

extensional regime related to Rondonian-San Ignacio orogeny or to the opening of the 

Greenvillian ocean”. In the Guaporé Fold Belt, Rizzotto et al., (2013) obtained 207Pb/206Pb 

ages analysing zircons from a coarse-grained porphyritic monzogranite of the Igarapé 

Enganado Intrusive Suite. The Concordia age of 1340 ± 5 Ma from this suite is correlated to 

the peak of metamorphism and deformation in the Guaporé Suture.  

4.3.3. Guaporé Formation 

Figueiredo et al (1974, in Santos et al., 1978) define as Guaporé Formation the 

group of sediments, consolidated or not, deposited in the flood plain of the Guaporé River. 

Torres et al (1978) report intense laterization processes, with lateritic crusts up to 40 meters 



22 
 

in height. Two members were determined to the Guaporé Formation, being the former 

(inferior) the eluvial-colluvial sediments originated from the erosion of the Serra dos 

Uopianes hills and the second (superior), the fluvial sediments associated to the present 

rivers in the region (Torres et al., 1978). 

4.4. Methodology 

Fieldwork surveys for sampling were performed during the Amazonian summer. For 

this study, 18 rock samples were analysed. The bulk-rock chemistry was determined by 

geochemical analyses performed in the laboratory ALS Global using ICP-AES analyses 

(Service Pack ME-ICP06 – ALS Global, 2018) or major oxides chemistry and ICP-MS 

(Service Pack ME-MS81 – ALS Global, 2018) analyses for trace and rare earth elements. 

The samples for ICP-AES assays were prepared on a fused bead with posterior acid 

digestion. The analytes for the analyses of ICP-MS were prepared using lithium borate 

fusion and four acid digestion.  

The petrographic studies were supported by mineralogical XRD analyses, also 

developed by ALS Global (Service Pack XRDSQ – ALS Global, 2018).  

The samples CM-31 and CM-39 were assayed under the technique X-ray diffraction 

of rock powder. The analyses were performed by ALS Global laboratory using a Bruker D8 

Focus Bragg-Brentano diffractometer with a tube of cobalt. The range of 2? was between 2º 

and 70º, with a theta step size of 0.1º and an analysis speed of 1.2 s per step. The mineral 

composition was determined by the diffractometric results using the Rietveld method. 

Electronic Microprobe Analyses (EPMA) were performed on six samples, partly at the 

Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) and at the Laboratory for 

Microprobe at the Institute for Geosciences of the University of Brasília (LM-IG-UnB). The 

samples CM-20, CM-28B, CM-31 and CM-39 were analysed by BGR, with given results for 

Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Sr, Y, Zr, La, Ce and Hf. In the (LM-IG-UnB), the samples 

CM-04 and CM-20 were analysed in three different proceedings: (i) – silicates, aiming to 

analyse Na, Mg, F, Al, Si, Ca, K, Cl, Ti, Cr, Mn, Sr, Ni, Fe, V and Ba;  REE, with results for 

REE + Na, K, Sr, Pb, Th, U and Ba; (ii) – major elements, with results for F, Al, Si, Hf, Nb, 

P, Ti, Mn, Y, Ta, Ca, Zr and Fe and (iii) – REE, with results for REE + Na, K, Sr, Pb, Th, U 

and Ba. The two former analysis stages were performed to determine the mineral, being the 

first for silicate minerals (e.g. arfvedsonite) and the second on potential hosts for REE (e.g. 

zircon). The third proceeding was performed to determine REE content in the analysed 



23 
 

minerals. The analytical parameters used for the EPMA analyses are in the Appendix I. The 

geological map presented in this work (Fig. 2) was supported by fieldwork data integrated 

with geophysical data from Buch et al. (2018) and CPRM (2010). 

4.5. Field and Petrographic Aspects 

The area of study comprises the locally known Serra Grande hill and its vicinities. 

The Serra Grande hill is a very pronounced elevation on the Guaporé flood plain, 25 km 

NNW of the city of Costa Marques, elongated in NW-SE direction, 10 km in length and 2 km 

wide. Around the hill, there is a wide plain with little morphological changes.  

The Serra Grande hill represents mainly the outcrop of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

and during this study, it was discovered that the São Domingos and Costa Marques intrusive 

suites also outcrop in the area (Fig. 4.2). Around the Serra Grande Hill, there are lateritic 

crusts and the clastic deposits from the Guaporé Formation. Locally also alluvial and 

colluvial clastic deposits occur which are related to the current depositional dynamic 

environment. 

4.5.1. Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is a massive stock domaining the area of the Serra 

Grande Hill. Other small plutons in the NW of Costa Marques also occur in the same 

directional trend (Fig 4.1). The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is covered by scattered vegetation 

and is covered on its borders by laterites (Fig 4.3.a). The outcrops are usually big exposure 

of rocks, though, given the tropical climate, the rocks present variable degrees of weathering 

(Fig 4.3.b).  

Bettencourt et al. (2012) define the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as aegirine-augite-

riebeckite quartz syenites and alkali feldspar granites. In this study, these lithotypes are 

found in almost all the Serra Grande Hill, and the granite subfacies are differentiated mainly 

by texture. In mesoscopic scale, the granitoids are gray to pinkish gray, with a phaneritic 

seriate to the equigranular texture that varies from fine-middle grained (fmg subfacies) up to 

coarse-middle grained (cmg subfacies) and a massive structure.  



24 
 

 

Figure 4.2: Geological map of the studied area and location of the studied samples. 

The cmg subfacies is the dominant variety of alkali feldspar granites and quartz 

syenites (Fig. 4.4.a). The rock is composed by subhedral microcline, euhedral to subhedral 

elongated crystals of Na-amphibole and interstitial anhedral quartz. In this subfacies, the 



25 
 

microcline tends to be more euhedric and the amphibole crystals are larger compared with 

microcline and amphiboles of the other subfacies.  

The fmg subfacies occurs in a very restricted region, in the central part of the ridge 

(Fig 4.2).  It is mainly composed of a grey-pinkish equigranular matrix of subhedral to 

euhedral alkaline feldspar, subhedral sodic amphiboles and interstitial anhedric quartz (Fig 

4.4.b).  

 In the eastern portion of the hill outcrops the medium equigranular subfacies (mg) 

with a greenish-grey matrix composed of subhedral to anhedaal microcline, subhedral 

ripiform sodic amphiboles and anhedral quartz (Fig 4.4.c).  

 

Figure 4.3: a – The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is surrounded by the Guaporé River floodplain; b – 

Outcrop in the Serra Grande Hill. The vegetation is scarce, giving a good rock exposure. 

In the eastern portion of the area, the syenite is intruded by a a decameter-wide 

trachytic dyke. The trachyte represents volcanic facies of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. It 

has an aphanitic matrix and phenocrystals of alkaline feldspar and sodic amphiboles (Fig. 

4.4.d). Enclaves are found in the northwest area associated with the cmg subfacies. Part of 

these enclaves is round shaped xenoliths with an aphanitic gray matrix and ripiform 

phenocrystals of feldspar (Fig. 4.4.e). Also, pegmatoid pods are sparsely found associated 

with cmg subfacies, where centimeter-sized euhedral amphibole and centimeter-sized 

anhedral quartz are found.  

Another feature is the clusters of Na-amphibole indicating local magmatic flow (Fig. 

4.4. f). Also, a very important feature of these granites is the presence of interstitial fine 

grained elpidite (Fig 4.4.a, b, c). The elpidite is the mineral that gives to the Ouro Fino 

Intrusive Suite a pink coloured aspect and reaches up to 5% of the modal mineralogy. Small 



26 
 

scale elongated quartz veins crosscut the granite stock and are parallel to the main NW-

trend. 

 

Figure 4.4: a – coarse-midle grained subfcacies exhibiting a phaneritic equigranular texture; b – fine-middle 
grained subfaces with pervasive presence of elpidite in the rock matrix; c – middle grained subfacies of the 
Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite; d – trachyte dyke with scattered phenocrystals of Na-amphibole and K-feldspar and 
aphanitic grey matrix ; e – Enclave with mafic aphanitic matrix and ripiform K-feldspar phenocrystals; f – Local 
magmatic flow of Na-amphiboles. 



27 
 

In microscopic scale, differences in grain size are less evident on the microscopic 

scale. The variable grain size of microcline causes granulometric differences between the 

subfacies. The rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite are holocrystalline, leucocratic, 

medium grained and equigranular to seriate texture (Fig 4.5.a, b). The main minerals 

observed in thin section are micropertitic microcline, arfvedsonite rimmed by aegirine, quartz 

and elpidite (Fig. 4.5.c, d). Titanite, zircon, analcime, garnet and aenigmatite occur 

subordinately in sub- to anhedral, fine-grained habits. (Fig. 4.5. e, f). 

 The microcline exhibits euhedral to subhedral crystals with compositional zoning 

and micropertitic exsolution. The crystals usually are squared and are often seen as 

inclusions inside of the Na-amphiboles. Also, some crystals present very fine-grained 

inclusions that resemble zircon and apatite. In some samples, the microcline presents subtle 

albitization, with fine grained anhedral albite. The main Na-amphibole is arfvedsonite, 

occurring as subhedral to euhedral ripiform crystals. Its edges are frequently rimmed by 

aegirine and the replacement in some crystals is quite intense, being the aegirine 

overplacing the arfvedsonite.  

Quartz is medium- to fine-grained and occupies interstices between the other 

minerals. The form of the crystals is defined by the shape of the surroundings crystals and 

the contacts are usually curvy to straight. Some inclusions of euhedral microcline crystals 

are scattered in the quartz crystals. Undulatory extinction is a common feature in these 

crystals. The elpidite occurs in clusters of fine to very fine-grained crystals associated with 

fine-grained anhedral quartz and with anhedral zircon. The zircon is always anhedral, yellow 

coloured and fine grained. It is always occupying voids and interstices between the the major 

minerals. Along with zircon, the titanite fills the interstices of the rock. Analcime, garnet and 

aenigmatite are rare and if present, they are anhedral and fine-grained. The table 1 

(Appendix 1) summarizes the modal mineralogy from the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite that had 

been identified in the petrographic studies.

The modal mineralogy from the cmg and fmg subfacies was also verified through 

XRD analyses using the Rietveld method to interpret the mineralogical composition. The 



29 
 

mineralogical results from the XRD of rock powder analyses are displayed in Table 2 

(Appendix 1). The two analysed samples represent the two most common phases of the 

Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite Suite, the fmg and cmg phases. The results display relative equal 

contents of sodic and potassic feldspars, evidencing thus the hypersolvus character of the 

massif. The quartz exhibits higher content than expected from the optical estimation of the 

thin sections. The results for mafic minerals suggests that in the cmg granites. there is less 

aegirine than in the fmg lithotype. Elpidite, which composes between 5 and 10 % of modal 

mineralogy was not identified in the DRX assays. 

4.5.2. São Domingos Intrusive Suite 

The southern-central part of the massif presents a pink grayish granitoid, with a 

porphyritic texture defined by pink K-feldspar crystals in a fine grained equigranular matrix 

composed of amphibole, K-feldspar and quartz. This porphyritic granite is part of the São 

Domingos Intrusive Suite. The phenocrystals are euhedral to subhedral and dominate the 

matrix (80% of K-feldspar). The amphiboles are needle-shaped and the quartz, 

subordinately occupy the interstices between the other crystals. Like the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite, the São Domingos Intrusive Suite presents enclaves that have a brecciated 

appearance, with angular forms and vary from a very hololeucocratic matrix defined by 

alkaline feldspar to a melanocratic aphanitic mafic composition matrix composed of fine-

grained mafic minerals.  

Microscopically, these granitoids display a seriate texture. The microcline presents 

intense micropertitic intergrowth. Plagioclase is fine to middle grained, tabular shaped and 

subhedral form and can substitute microcline in the rims. Quartz is anhedral to subhedral 

and is interstitial between other minerals. As mafic minerals, there is subhedral medium-

grained biotite. Opaque minerals occur scattered throughout the rock. Whereas in the Ouro 

Fino Intrusive Suite the euhedral zircon is absent, the São Domingos Intrusive Suite shows 

zircon crystals with euhedral form. 

4.5.3. Costa Marques Intrusive Suite 

The eastern part of the Serra Grande hill is intersected by a diabase/dacite dyke, of 

N10E trend. The rock has a porphyritic texture defined by milimetric euhedral crystals of K-

feldspar and a gray aphanitic matrix. Veinlets of anhedrical fine grained K-feldspar cut the 



30 
 

rock. Millimeter-sized amygdalae occur frequently in the rocks. Southwards from the Serra 

Grande, there are volcanic breccias associated with trachytes. 

4.6. Geochemistry 

The geochemical results are from 18 rock samples and permitted not only to classify 

the rocks but also to discriminate the volcanic rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite from 

the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite and São Domingos Intrusive Suite, which occurrence in 

the Serra Grande Hill was up to date unknown. Among the 18 analysed rocks, 13 are from the 

Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, 2 from the São Domingos Intrusive Suite and 3 from the Costa 

Marques Intrusive Suite. All the three subfacies of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite were 

analyzed along with a trachyte dyke. The basalt that is part of to the Costa Marques Intrusive 

Suite is not included in the charts of Fig 4.9 once these diagrams are not suitable for this 

kind of rock. Some samples of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite yielded Zr content more than 

the upper detection limit (10,000 ppm) and thus, these Zr contents are considerate as 10,000 

ppm in order to permit the plots. The geochemical results for the three suites are exposed 

in Table 3 (Appendix 1). 

In accord with Frost et al. (2001), the figure 4.6.a shows the FeOtot/(FeOtot+MgO) 

plots for the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, São Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques 

Intrusive Suite. In this chart, all the three suites display a strict ferroan character. However, 

in the MALIxSiO2 plot (Frost et al. 2001), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite presents a variation 

between alkaline and calc-alkaline (Fig. 4.6.b). The calc-alkaline types are the trachyte dyke, 

fmg, mg and cmg subfacies, whereas the cmg and mg subfacies show higher variability. 

The São Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite plot only in the 

alkaline field.   

Consonant with Maniar and Piccoli (1989), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite features a 

peralkaline pattern in the chart A/NK x A/CNK chart (Fig. 4.6.c). Moreover, the São 

Domingos Intrusive Suite exhibits a peralkaline composition whereas the Costa Marques 

Intrusive Suite is metaluminous. In the three charts (Fig. 4.6 d, e, f) for discrimination 

between A-type and I- or S-type granites, the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite presents a distinct 

A-type granite character (Whalen et al., 1987). The São Domingos Intrusive Suite and Costa 

Marques Intrusive Suite are also included in the A-type field, but litte less prounounced. The 



31 
 

Zr, Ce and Y contents of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite are 10-times higher compared to the 

Costa Marques Intrusive Suite.  

 

Figure 4.6:  Binary diagrams of the chemical results from the silica saturated rocks of the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite (OFIS), São Domingos Intrusive Suite (SDIS) and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite (CMIS) in accord to 

Frost et al. (2011) – a and b; Maniar and Piccoli (1989) - c; Whalen et al. (1987) – d, e and f. 

The REE contents normalized to the chondrite of Boynton (1984) show clear 

discrepancies between the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, 

though not so evident discrepancies between the São Domingos Intrusive Suite and Ouro 

Fino Intrusive Suite (Fig. 4.7). In the Costa Marques Intrusive Suite, the REE-patterns 

display a discrete Eu anomaly and also a flat line in the basalt sample. In the Costa Marques 

Intrusive Suite, the LREE are slightly enriched compared to HREE, yielding an average 

(La/Yb)n = 5.15. 

The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite reveals different enrichments for LREE in relation to 

HREE (Fig. 4.7). The average (La/Yb)n rate for the cmg subfaces is 7.36 and for the fine-



32 
 

middle grained 10.42. The only sample of the middle grained subfaces shows (La/Yb)n = 

6.92. The São Domingos Intrusive Suite evidence (La/Yb)n rates of 12.49 – similar to the 

fmg of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. 

 

 

Figure 4.7: REE content of the analysed rocks from the Costa Marques (CMIS), São Domingos (SDIS) and 

Ouro Fino (OFIS) intrusive suites normalized to the chondrite of Boyton (1984). 

Europium anomalies are distinct in both Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and São 

Domingos Intrusive Suite. In accord with the figure 4.7, some samples of the Ouro Fino 

Intrusive Suite displayed Ce anomalies, either with some Ce depletion or enrichment.  

The Fig. 4.8 presents the multielement chart with the chemical results from the three 

suites after normalization to the chondrite of Thompson (1982). The Costa Marques Intrusive 

Suite presents K enrichment whereas the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and São Domingos 

Intrusive Suite are depleted in this element. Strontium, P and Ti form negative anomalies in 

the Ouro Fino and São Domingos intrusive suites, however, in the Costa Marques Intrusive 

Suite, these elements are slightly depleted. The lower contents of Ba and higher contents 

of Zr, Hf, Y and REE permit a clear distinction between the of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 



33 
 

and the other two suites, resulting thus in the geochemical discrimination of the rocks that 

outcrop in the Serra Grande Hill. The higher contents of Zr, Hf, Y and REE can be related 

to the zircon and elpidite (zirconosilicates) that are absent in the Costa Marques Intrusive 

Suite and less frequent in the São Domingos Intrusive Suite, in which only primary zircon 

has been identified.  

 

Figure 4.8: Chemical results chart from the analysed samples from the Costa Marques (CMIS), São 

Domingos (SDIS) and Ouro Fino (OFIS) intrusive suites normalized to the chondrite of Thompson (1982). 

In accord with Eby (1992), the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite and São Domingos Intrusive 

Suite fit into the A2-type granite (Fig. 4.9.a, b). Although, one sample presented an A1-type pattern, what 

could be considered as possible hydrothermal alteration.

and Ouro Fino intrusive suites. a – ternary diagram Y-Nb-Ce; b – ternary diagram for Y-Nb-3*Ga.  

4.7. Mineral Chemistry  

Electron probe microanalyses (EPMA) were performed on 6 samples from the Ouro 

Fino Intrusive Suite. Among, these 6 samples, the samples CM-20B, CM28C, CM31 and 

CM39 were analysed at BGR in Hanover, Germany. The samples CM18 and CM20A were 

analysed in the EPMA laboratory from the Universidade de Brasília. All the samples are 

alkali feldspar granites with sodic amphiboles, 5 from the cmg subfacies and one from the 

fmg subfaces (CM31). The targeted minerals were amphiboles, aegirines rimming the 

amphiboles, titanite and the zirconosilicates (elpidite and zircon). The classification of 

amphiboles was made in accord with the spreadsheet of Locock (2014), the pyroxenes were 

defined with the aid of the software PX-NOM (Sturm, 2002).  

The main amphibole identified in the EPMA analysis is arfvedsonite (Table 4). In 

accord with the classification of Locock (2014), the mineral chemistry leaded to the 

identification of ferro-eckermannite and fluor-arfvedsonite. However, the chemical 

composition of the analysed amphiboles did not differ significantly, therefore the single term 

arfvedsonite is more appropriate for this work. The analysed pyroxenes were always at the 

rims of the Na-amphiboles. In accord with the PX-NOM software, all the pyroxenes are 

strictly aegirine. Compared to the aegirine, arfvedsonite presents a higher CaO budget. 

Moreover, the arfvedsonite exhibits F contents yielding between 1.44% and 2% of F. 



35 
 

Titanite, zircon and elpidite were defined in accord with the stoichiometric balance 

for the calculated oxides of the analysed elements. Moreover, for the zirconosilicates, a 

classification scheme created by Salvi and Williams-Jones (1995) was used given the 

relationship between these minerals with mineralization (Fig. 4.12). The mineral chemistry 

results and classification of the analysed amphiboles and pyroxenes are shown in table 2. 

The mineral chemistry results for analysed zircon and titanite are in table 5 and for elpidite 

in table 6. 

In accord with the EPMA results (Fig 10.a, b), the zircon yields TREO+Y (total rare 

earth oxides + yittrium oxide) values from 3.2% up to 7.3% (Table 5). The titanite also 

contains REE+Y in its structure, but the TREO+Y content ranges in a lower interval between 

1.07 and 3.53% (Table 5). Analyses of elpidite (Fig 10.c, d) show Y2O3 contents ranging 

from 0.21 up to 1.92 wt.%, but low LREE (La, Ca) contents (Tab 4). An enrichment of CaO 

was observed in the elpidite, hence defining the elpidites of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as 

Ca-elpidite given the trend towards gittinsite and armostrongite (Fig 4.12). The CaO contents 

vary from 0.30 in elpidites from the cmg subfacies (CM-39) up to 3.01% in the fmg subfacies 

(CM-31), with an average of 1.75%. K2O contents are also high in some elpidite crystals, 

ranging between 4.18% and 6.94% whereas when in low content, ranges between 0.26 and 

0.65%.  

The zircon and the elpidite can be considered important hosts for Zr and Hf. The Zr 

and Hf in the zircon vary from 56.17% up to 59.87% and 0.93% up to 1.49%, respectively 

(Table. 5). Elpidite carries less Zr and Hf amounts with values ranging from 18.9% up to 

21.82 % for Zr and for Hf the variability lies between 0.34% up to 0.57% (Table 6). 

Nonetheless, elpidite content in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite reaches up to 5% in a modal 

estimative. becoming the major REE-Zr host in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite. The titanite 

presents some enrichment of Y, La and Ce reaching around 3% in total (Table 5.).

previous image, now in under the plane polarized light; c – elpidite crystals cluster and the spots where the 
crystals were analysed by EPMA. BSE image; d – The same elpidite cluster seen under the plane polarized 
light. 

Since zircon is the mineral that contains the highest content of REE+Y in the Ouro 

Fino Intrusive Suite, WDS analyses targeted a zircon from the sample CM18. The Fig. 4.11.a 

shows the analysed minerals, and Table 7 exhibits the respective chemical WDS analyses 

from the spots 31/1, 31/2 and 31/3. The spot 31/2 target the centre of the crystal and spots 

31/1 and 31/2 analysed the surrounding area. The zircon yielded TREO+Y of 5,15%, 

however, the surrounding area of the analysed crystal presented 16.83% and 23.83% of 

TREO+Y for the spots 31/1 and 31/3 respectively (Table 7). Though, the targeted area of 

spots 31/3 did not fill the stoichiometric composition of zircon, being not possible to 

determine which mineral the crystal needles might represent. The spot 31/1 represents the 

chemical composition of the mass rimming these acicular minerals and the zircon (Fig 

4.11.b). The rimming mass is composed mainly of SiO (27.4%). FeO (14.6%). CaO (10.9%) 

and ZrO (7.2%), being also not possible to determine which mineral it could represent. In 



37 
 

the needle around the zircon boundary, REE occur mainly as La2O3 (5.9%), Ce2O3(8.1%), 

Nd2O3(1.1%). The other REE occur variable and less significative amounts. For the mass 

rimming the zircon and the acicular crystals, Ce is the dominant REE. In both spots 31/1 

and 31/3, F was not detected.

region inside the blue square. Note the mass and needles grown on the zircon crystal boundary. 

4.8. The Origin of the REE-Zr Mineralization  

The new mapping for the region of Serra Grande Hill (Fig. 4.2) shows two other 

igneous units outcropping in the area. Despite the fact that the Costa Marques and São 

Domingos intrusive suites are also alkaline (Payolla et al., 2013, this work), the petrographic 

features associated with geochemical data and previous surveys (Costa, 1990; Buch et al., 

2018) demonstrate that the REE-Zr mineralization is constricted to the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite.  

According to with Eby (1992), the Fig. 4.9 shows that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

and the São Domingos Intrusive Suite originated from the melting of continental crust. 

Bettencourt et al. (2014)  state that isotopes of Hf confirm the old crustal source for the 

magmas of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite whereas the São Domingos Intrusive Suite is of 

juvenile and crustal origins. The REE chart indicates that the fractionation of LREE in the 

São Domingos Intrusive Suite is greater than in the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, even though 

the fmg subfacies show similar values (Fig. 4.8).  



38 
 

The absence of primary magmatic zircon and the outstanding elpidite content of the 

Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite compared to the São Domingos Intrusive Suite endorse the 

assertion that the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is the host of the REE-Zr mineralization. 

4.9. Comparison with Similar REE-Zr Deposits 

The chemical, petrographic and mineralogical results of this study point out the 

existence of a REE-Zr mineralization in the Ouro Fino Intrusive. Rare metal mineralizations 

are related to alkaline granites such as Strange Lake, Kahn Bogd and Kaldzan-Buregtey  

(Salvi and Williams-Jones. 1990; Gysi and Williams-Jones. 2013; Kovalenko et al.. 1995; 

Kynicky et al.. 2011). In these deposits, the main ore minerals are sodic-calcic 

zirconosilicates like elpidite, armstrongite, gittingsite, catapleiite, zircon and eudialyte.  

In the Strange Lake deposit, the mineralization is related to elpidite crystallized 

under magmatic conditions, whereas the Ca-zirconosilicates (armstrongite and gittinsite) are 

the result of late stage metasomatic processes, thus replacing primary elpidite ( Salvi and 

Williams-Jones. 1995). In Khan-Bogd and Strange Lake, there is a lack of primary zircon and 

magmatic elpidite is abundant (Kynicky et al., 2011; Salvi and Williams-Jones, 1995). As 

well, the replacement of elpidite for Ca-elpidite and armstrongite happens in Khan-Bogd. 

The results of our study indicate that these characteristics appear likewise in the Ouro Fino 

Intrusive Suite.  

In the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite, the Ca-Zr silicates are absently reflecting the low 

content of Ca2+ in the fluid. Though the fig. 4.12 shows that elpidite and zircon present a 

trend towards gittinsite and armostrongite. being the elpidite from the cmg subfaces the most 

calcic. The blurry aspect of the elpidite in thin-section and SEM images support the 

hypothesis of secondary origin. The enrichment of K2O in elpidite is still not well understood, 

however, the elpidites of Khan Bogd present K2O enrichments as well (Grigor’eva et al., 

2011).  

The lack of gittinsite in the rock could be related to the absence or insufficiency of 

Ca2+ in the fluid. Additionally, titanite could be a Ca2+ consumer during the metasomatic 

processes. The Ca could be originated from the amphiboles structures since the amphiboles 

presented up to 6% of CaO in the mineral chemistry results (Table 4).

4.10. A Mineralization Model for the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

In this work, no other other minerals that might contain REE in the Ouro Fino 

Intrusive Suite have been identified. The occurrence of xenotime and bastnaesite, which are 

common in other deposits (Gysi and Williams-Jones, 2013; Michael et al, 2017; 

Chakhmouradian and Zaitsev, 2012), are reported in previous works (Freitas, 1985; Costa, 

1990; Costa, 1988) whereas in this work, the presence of these minerals is still not 

confirmed. Moreover, this study does not comprise F analyses in the bulk-rock chemistry, 

but the mineral chemistry analyses for arfvedsonite and aegirine evidence a depletion of F 

from the arfvedsonite during transformation to aegirine (table 2), suggesting F as an active 

agent during the ore formation processes. In addition, the zircon crystals and the mass 

around them yielded none F content, what could imply a release of F from Na-amphiboles 

before the mineralization. Another possibility is the fractionation of F in the lattice of Ca-

elpidite, resulting in the capture of F from the fluid before the crystallisation of zircon. These 



40 
 

hypotheses suggest the hydrothermal-deuteric mineralization happened without or little 

amount F in the system and explains the lack of REE fluoride minerals in the Ouro Fino 

Intrusive Suite.  

In fact, the absence of F in the mineralization fluid is not impeditive to transport REE 

but to precipitate them (Migdisov et al., 2016). These authors define S and Cl as main 

ligands for transport of the REE at hydrothermal conditions, whereas the presence of F 

reduces the stabilities of REE in hydrothermal fluids. Indeed, the elpidite concentrations up 

to 5% in the rock matrix place this mineral as the main ore mineral for the Ouro Fino Intrusive 

Suite mineralization.  

The significant amount of Ca-elpidite, or pseudomorphs of elpidite, suggests H2O 

dominated crystallization conditions and classify the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite as agpaitic 

despite the fact that the hydrothermalism resulted also in zircon, which is considered a 

mineral of miaskitic rocks (Marks and Markl, 2017). The deposition of REE, in this case, 

could be associated with the inclusion into the structure of the zirconosilicates, which are 

REE-free minerals. Migdisov et al. (2016) consider that the incorporation of REE into the 

lattice of non-REE minerals is one of the effective fractionation mechanism for REE.  

The needles and the mass rimming zircon crystals exhibit SiO2, FeO, CaO and ZrO 

contentss associated with high concentrations of La2O3, Ce2O3 and Nd2O3. The mass and 

the needles might have precipitated onto the edges of zircon during the decrease of 

hydrothermalism temperature. Moreover, the absence of F in these rims corroborate the 

hypotheses of F depletion or incorporation in the lattice of elpidite. If the late fluid contained 

some F, it should be expected that some REE-fluoride could be identified.  

Thereby, the sequence of the mineral crystallization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite 

is proposed in the fig. 4.13. Given the inclusions of K-feldpar in the amphiboles, it is assumed 

that microcline was formed in the early magmatic stages. The arfvedsonite formed in the 

sequence followed by the aegirine on its rims. The existence of ferro-eckermannite in the 

Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is still not well understood. If an albitization took place in the late 

stages of magmatism, the ferro-eckermannite could be the result of incorporation of Al2O3 

by the Na-amphiboles. But this hypothesis is still constricted by the need for further studies. 

The existence of anhedric and fine grained elpidite in clusters that resemble 

pseudomorpohs of elpidite sustain the possibility of primary elpidite instead of zircon. Thus, 



41 
 

zircon and Ca-elpidite formed in the hydrothermal stages. The existence of titanite in the 

rock beside zircons in the interstitial spaces could only explain a hydrothermal origin.

4.11. Conclusion 

This study identifies the existence of three different alkaline intrusive suites in the 

Serra Grande Hill. Even though the São Domingos (1057 ± 10 Ma) and the Costa Marques 

intrusive (998 ± 10 Ma) suites intrude the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite (1347 ± 9Ma), the 

petrographic and geochemical data advocate that the REE-Zr mineralization is factually 

associated to the most anciet of them. 

The Ouro Fino Intrusive Suite is a hypesolvus alkaline granite, being microcline the 

first mineral to crystallize, and followed by the arfvedsonite. The substitution of arfvedsonite 

to aegirine in the amphibole rimes and also eventual rims of plagioclase on microcline rims 

are evidence of a Na enrichment during the crystallization.  

The REE-Zr mineralization of the Ouro Fino Intrusive Suites is associated mainly 

with elpidite and zircon and subordinately with titanite. The crystallisation of the 

zirconosilicates seems to happen in the late-crystallization processes, with elpidite, titanite 



42 
 

and specially zircon occupying interstices of the rock. The formation of elpidite and zircon 

might be associated with pre-existing high contents of Zr, REE and Na in the magma, 

whereas titanite can be the metasomatic product of aenigmatite and Ca depletion from 

amphiboles. 

The present study did not identify fluorides, carbonates and sulphides associated 

with the mineralization. The REE fractionation from the magma is possibly a product of 

incorporation of REE in the lattice of elpidite, titanite and specially zircon. The existence of 

an amorphous mass rich on Ce and La around of zircon crystals propones that REE also 

concentrated by the cooling of the hydrothermal system. There is a clear enrichment of 

LREE compared to HREE, being the average Lan/Ybn ? 8. 

The existence of pseudomorphos of primary elpidite defines the Ouro Fino 

magmatism as agpaitic, allied to its clear peralkaline character. Similar examples of REE-Zr 

mineralization are Strange Lake, in Canadá and, Khan Bogd and Khaldzan Buregtey, both 

in Mongolia.
