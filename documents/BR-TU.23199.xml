Introduction

The theory of nonlinear partial di?erential equations that exhibit some sort of

degeneracy or singularity has been widely investigated in the last decades, both

for the great number of applications it has in the ?elds of mathematical biology,

?uid mechanics, heat propagation, and for their mathematical interest. In fact, this

area is pivotal in combining the theory of nonlinear evolution PDEs with geometry,

dynamical systems and other areas of applied mathematics. Despite the fact that

the theory of linear PDEs experienced much progress, it was soon observed that

most of equations modelling physical phenomena, without excessive simpli?cation

are nonlinear and some of them with singularities/degeneracies. Unfortunately, just

after the 1960s the development of functional analysis made it possible to start

building theories for these type of PDEs with full mathematical rigour.

Two of the most important degenerate/singular nonlinear PDEs are the porous

medium equation, shortly PME,

ut ? ?um = 0, m &gt; 1, (PME)

and the parabolic p-Laplace equation, shortly PLE,

ut ?div(|?u|p?2?u) = 0, p &gt; 1, (PLE)

where ? = ?x, ? = ?x represent the Laplace operator and the gradient operator

respectively, acting only on the space variables. Both equations can be posed for

all x ? Rd, d ? 1 and 0 &amp;lt;t &amp;lt;? (Cauchy problem), but are quite often posed

in a bounded subdomain ? ? Rd, d ? 1 and 0 &amp;lt;t &amp;lt;T (Dirichlet problem). In

the Cauchy problem the determination of a unique solution asks only for initial

conditions, however in the second case boundary conditions are also needed. In this

text we will work just with local solutions, leaving aside the boundary conditions.

Both equations have great importance since they are both, somehow a generalization

of the heat equation (notice that for m = 1 and p = 2 the equations are reduced to

the heat equation ut = ?u).

Chapter 1 Introduction

Our main goal is to describe the method of intrinsic scaling, a method for obtain-

ing continuity results, in particular Hölder continuity for weak solutions of degenerate

and singular parabolic equations. This method can be used for a great number of

equations, but it is famous mostly because it can be applied to the PLE, the PME

and equations with a similar structure. To avoid some technical di?culties we will

use the PME as a model for the method.

1.1. The porous medium equation

The reader may wonder why we have choosen a simple-looking variation of the

famous heat equation,

ut ? ?u = 0, (HE)

for this text. First of all, the fact that the theory of the PME departs strongly

from the heat equation was a great booster both for the pure mathematician and the

applied scientist to start studying this equation. This equation appears in several

useful applications and its study reveals to be very helpful on the development of

interesting and sophisticate results in nonlinear analysis.

In this regard, there are a number of physical applications where the simple PME

model appears in a natural way, mainly to describe processes involving ?uid ?ow,

heat transfer or di?usion. The best known is probably the description of the ?ow of

an ideal gas in a homogeneous porous medium, indeed the PME owes its name to

this application, modelled by Leibenzon [8] and Muskat [11] around 1930. Another

important application, essential for the historic development of the ?eld, happens

in the theory of heat propagation, more speci?cally Zel'dovich and Raizer in [17],

propose a PME as a model to describe heat propagation by radiation occurring in

plasmas (ionized gases) at very high temperatures. In fact, this subject motivated

the rigorous mathematical development of the theory. Other applications have been

proposed in mathematical biology, boundary layer theory, and other ?elds. This

equation is also a good model to study hard subjects as ?nite propagation, free

boundaries, self-similar solutions, among others. The reader can explore these areas

in [16].

1.1.1. The PME as a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation

The PME, and also the PLE, constitute the most famous examples of nonlinear

degenerate and singular parabolic equation. However, before exploring this fact let

2



1.1 The porous medium equation

us remember what this concepts are.

Linear parabolic PDEs are the most common evolution equations. These PDEs

can be de?ned in divergence form, as

ut ?
n?

i,j=1

(aij(x,t))uxi)xj +
n?
i

bi(x,t)uxi + c(x,t)u = f,

with aij measurable and bounded coe?cients satisfying the ellipticity condition

?|?|2 ?
n?

i,j=1

aij?i?j ? ?|?|2, (1.1)

for all ? ? Rn. However in this text we will just study di?usion equations, which

means that we will suppose bi = 0, c = 0. To simplify the calculations, we will also

consider the homogeneous case, f = 0.

The next step was extending this de?nition to quasilinear equations of the form

ut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = 0, (1.2)

permitting the function A to be nonlinear, only assumed to be measurable and

subject to the structure conditions???
??
A(x,t,u,?u) ·?u ? ?(x,t,u,?u)|?u|2

|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? |?(x,t,u,?u)||?u|,
(1.3)

where ? and ? are given functions. This type of equations are still referred to as

parabolic if there exist two positive constants ?0 ? ?1 such that

?0 ? ?(x,t,u,?u) and ?(x,t,u,?u) ? ?1. (1.4)

Lastly, a parabolic partial di?erential equation of the type (4.2) is termed de-

generate if the modulus of ellipticity ?(x,t,u,?u) tends to zero at some point of its

domain of de?nition; whereas it is termed singular if ?(x,t,u,?u) tends to in?nity.

Easily we can conclude that the porous medium equation (PME) is of the degen-

erate type. In fact, it can be rewritten in the divergence form as

ut ?div(mum?1?u) = 0, m &gt; 1,

where A = mum?1?u and ?(x,t,u,?u) = mum?1 which, evidently, tends to zero

when u tends to zero.

Notice that if we choose m &amp;lt;1, then ? = mum?1 tends to in?nity as u also goes

to in?nity and the equation will be singular. There is also a vast literature about

this case, however we will not study it in this text.

Chapter 1 Introduction

It is also important to highlight that the p-Laplace equation (PLE) has similar

properties. It is another example of this type of equation because it is degenerate

for p &gt; 2 and singular for 1 &amp;lt;p &amp;lt;2.

The fact that the PME is degenerate parabolic has deep mathematical conse-

quences, both qualitative and quantitative. Even if, in the second half of the last

century, when the tools of functional analysis were ready for it, the theory of non-

linear parabolic equations became a main area of research in PDEs not every result

could be extended to degenerate parabolic equation.

On the other hand, and as a sort of compensation, the equation enjoys a num-

ber of nice properties due to its simple form, which makes the PME an interesting

benchmark in the development of nonlinear analytical tools, and continues to make

its way into the pure and applied sciences, and consequently into the mainstream of

Mathematics.

1.2. Regularity theory and the method of intrinsic scaling

Nowadays, the regularity theory for PDEs is an important area for mathemati-

cians. As many others recent areas, regularity theory just rose in 1900, after the

well-known International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris where David Hilbert

presented his list of 23 problems that would shape the mathematics of the 20th cen-

tury. The way this theory started to develop, with the great mathematicians Ennio

De Giorgi, John Nash and Jürgen Moser, is one of the most famous in the history

in Mathematics. This subject was the main focus of my work in the ?rst semester

and the reader can learn more about it in my seminar [13]. Although the work was

written in Portuguese, if the language is a restraint there is also the paper [14] and

the book [15].

In the previously mentioned work, there is a detailed explanation on how De

Giorgi proved that weak solutions of an elliptic PDE of the form
n?

i,j=1

(
aij(x)uxj

)
xi

= 0,

with bounded and measurable coe?cients aij satisfying an ellipticity condition (1.1)

are Hölder continuous. Since the linearity does not play a role in the proofs of De

Giorgi, Ladyzhenskaya and Uralt'seva, during the mid 1960's, were able to prove in

[7] the same results for weak solutions of quasi-linear equations of the form

div a(x,u,?u) = 0,

4



1.2 Regularity theory and the method of intrinsic scaling

with structure assumptions of the type???
??
a(x,u,?u) ·?u ? C1|?u|p ?C2

|a(x,u,?u)| ? C2(|?u|p?1 + 1),

with p &gt; 1, and constants C1 &gt; 0 and C2 ? 0.

The next step is to pass to parabolic equations

n?
i,j=1

(
aij(x)ut ?uxj

)
xi

= 0,

with bounded and measurable coe?cients aij satisfying an ellipticity condition (1.1)

and

ut ?div a(x,u,?u) = 0,

with the same structure assumptions. Notice that this assumptions are a bit stronger

than (1.3), and unfortunately these ones does not include the PME as a particular

case, just the PLE. This was how the theory evolved historically and just afterwards

the results were generalized, reducing the assumptions.

Moser [10] was able to prove that weak solutions of linear parabolic equations

are locally Hölder continuous, however it was not possible to extend the results

to quasi-linear equations as we might expect, just for special cases. In 1967, La-

dyzenskaja, Solonnikov and Ural'ceva, in [12], were able to prove it for quasi-linear

equations with assumptions that include the parabolic case. Some other examples

appeared in the literature, however this problem remained open until mid 1980's

when DiBenedetto, in [4], showed that the solutions of quasilinear equations with

the previous assumptions are locally Hölder continuous. It was necessary to employ

a new approach to this problem and the answer was found with the intrinsic scaling

method. Surprisingly, this showed to be very versatile and could be appropriately

modi?ed to establish the same results for more general assumptions, including the

porous medium equation.

Continuity results of a function at a certain point can be obtained by measuring

its oscillation in a sequence of nested and shrinking cylinders with vertex at that

point, and proving that the oscillation converges to zero as the cylinders shrink to

the point. For the heat equation this idea work for the simple standard parabolic

cylinders,

Q(R2,R) = {(x,t) ? Rd ×R+; ||x?x0||? ? R2, 0 ? t0 ? t &amp;lt;R},

5



Chapter 1 Introduction

however for more complicated equations as the PME thus is not enough. These

cylinders must be rescaled to take into account the nature of the degeneracy or

singularity. A precise description of this fact is linked to the technical implementation

that we will develop in this works and will hopefully clarify the idea.

Although it could seem that the proof would be similar to the heat equation a

new problem arises, the nature of the scaling factors. The only way the cylinders

could re?ect the geometry of the equation is with an intrinsic scaling, which means

that the scaling factors must depend on the solution itself.

At the basis of the intrinsic scaling method is an iteration technique, which

constitutes a re?nement of the technique by De Giorgi and Moser [13, 14], based on

a priori estimates for the weak solutions. These estimates will be integral inequalities

that measure the behaviour of the function near its in?mum and its supremum. In the

case of solutions of degenerate or singular equations, one more di?culty arises; the

estimates are not homogeneous and involve integral norms corresponding to di?erent

powers. However, since our cylinders are intrinsically rescaled, we can recover the

homogeneity when we rewrite the estimates in this cylinders, absorbing in this way

many analysis di?culties in the geometry.

The a priori estimates will be the main tools in establishing the local Hölder

continuity for the solutions. Actually, once these estimates are obtained we don't

need the original equation any more as our problem turns to be purely analytic. We

may forget the initial equation and we just need to show that functions that satisfy

our integral inequalities are locally Hölder continuous.

The main goal of this work is to help the reader understand this method in full

depth and to bring to light what is really essential in this powerful tool in the analysis

of degenerate and singular equations. We want to highlight how the geometry and

the a priori estimates are important through all the proof. We want to convince the

reader of the strength this approach to regularity for an important and relevant class

of nonlinear partial di?erential equations.

1.3. Outline of the text

We have chosen the porous medium equation as a model to present the theory

for degenerate nonlinear equations. This equation highlights what is really essential

in the intrinsic scaling method, leaving aside technical di?culties that come along

with more general equations.

6



1.3 Outline of the text

This work is based on a similar work done for the p-Laplace equation in the

?rst part of [15]. Some proofs are presented in more detail and some ideas are also

inspired on others articles and books as [6] and [5, 16]. However, we do not pretend

this work to be just a rewrite of di?erent books and articles. Although the main idea

of the method is identical, we found several technical di?culties. Some of them were

solved by consulting other papers, and others with original ideas.

We start in Chapter 2 by presenting the problem formally. In section 2.1 we

introduce the precise de?nition of weak solution for the model problem. This is

followed, in section 2.2, by the derivation of the building blocks of the theory: the

local energy and logarithmic estimates. Then, section 2.3 will highlight the technical

tools that will be essential for the establishment of some results. The 3th chapter

presents in full detail the idea of intrinsic scaling, at least for the degenerate equation.

Section 3.1 deals with the construction of the appropriate geometric setting, bringing

in full detail the idea of intrinsic scaling. At this point, the problem is divided in

two alternatives, that will be studied separately in the sections 3.2 and 3.3. Finally,

chapter 4 culminates with the proof of the Hölder continuity. In section 4.2 we refer

to a simpler case that is not included in the previous approach to the parabolic case.

We close the chapter with remarks on possible generalizations, mainly to equations

with the full quasilinear structure and to the p-Laplace equation.

Chapter 2

Weak solutions and a priori

estimates

The main goal of this work is to describe the intrinsic scaling method. In this

chapter we will introduce some properties of the PME, de?nitions and results that

will be necessary trough the text. This method is used to prove the Hölder continuity

for the weak solutions of degenerate and singular parabolic equations. In this regard

we will use the porous medium equation,

ut ? ?um = 0, m &gt; 1, (PME)

to explain this method in detail, leaving aside technical di?culties related to more

general equations. We have chosen this equation because it is one of the simplest

examples of a parabolic non-linear evolution equation, appearing however in the

description of several natural phenomena. Its properties depart strongly from the

heat equation,

ut ? ?u = 0,

one of the most important PDE. There are a number of physical applications where

this simple model appears in a natural way, mainly to describe processes involving

?uid ?ow, heat transfer or di?usion.

Most physical settings lead to the default restriction u ? 0, which is mathemati-

cally convenient. As reported in the literature, in order to consider solutions without

this property a variation of the PME is used,

ut ? ?(|u|m?1u) = 0, (2.1)

usually referred as the signed porous medium equation. Some results can be extended

to this equation, the Hölder continuity of the weak solutions inclusively. For the

purpose of this work and to highlight the important aspect of the intrinsic scaling

method we decided that the simple PME is enough, but we will leave remarks along

the text to guide the prove for the signed PME.

9



Chapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates

Additionally, we will also suppose that u is bounded and set

M := ||u||L?.

Although only local boundedness is necessary we assume that u is bounded for

simpli?cation. So our goal is to prove that a non-negative and bounded solution, in

some sense, of the porous medium equation, (PME), is Hölder continuity.

If we consider ? to be a bounded domain in Rd, with smooth boundary ??,

we can de?ne the space time domain as ?T = ? × (0,T], T &gt; 0, with parabolic

boundary ?p?T = (?? × (0,T)) ? (? ×{0}). Next we will consider the degenerate

intrinsic parabolic distance from a compact set K ? ?T to ?p?T as

dist(K; ?p?T ) := inf
(x,y)?K

(y,s)??p?T

(
|x?y| + |t?s|

)
.

De?nition 2.1 (Locally Hölder continuous). A function u is locally Hölder contin-

uous in ?T if there exist a constant C and ? ? (0, 1), depending only on the data,

such that, for every compact subset K of ?T ,

|u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t2)| ? C

(
|x1 ?x2| + |t1 ? t2|

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
,

for every pair of points (xi, ti) ? K, i = 1, 2.

2.1. Two de?nitions of weak solutions

Not many second-order partial di?erential equations have solutions in the strong

sense. So we will start by de?ning weak solution for our problem. As usual, the

de?nition of weak solutions is obtained by multiplying by a test function, integrate

over a compact set and then integrating by parts. Formally it results in the following

de?nition.

De?nition 2.2. A local weak solution of (PME) is a bounded measurable function

)

.

10



2.1 Two de?nitions of weak solutions

However, this way of de?ning the weak solution does not involve the time deriva-

tive ut, which would be very useful in some proofs. As ut sometimes can only exist

in the sense of distributions we will introduce the Steklov average of a function

v ? L1(?T ) for 0 &amp;lt;h &amp;lt;T :

vh :=

???
??

1
h

? t+h
t

v(.,?)d? if t ? (0,T ?h],

0 if t ? (T ?h,T].

The Steklov average has nice properties: for v in the right spaces it converges to

v as h goes to 0.

Lemma 2.3. If v ? Lr(0,T,Lq(?)) then, as h ? 0, the Steklov average vh converges

to v ? Lq,r(?T??), for every ? ? (0,T). If v ? C(0,T; Lq(?)) then, as h ? 0, the

Steklov average vh(·, t) converges to v(·, t) in Lq(?), for every t ? (0,T??) and every

? ? (0,T).

Using the Steklov average it is possible to obtain another de?nition that will be

more useful through the calculations.

De?nition 2.4. A local weak solution of (PME) is a bounded measurable function

u ? Cloc
(
0,T; L2loc (?)

)
?L2loc

(
0,T; W

such that, for every compact K ? ? and for every 0 &amp;lt;t &amp;lt;T ?h,?

K×{t}
(uh)t ? + m

(
um?1?u

)
h
·??dx = 0, (2.3)

for all ? ? W 1,20 (K).

In fact, let us prove that these de?nitions are equivalent.

Theorem 2.5. The de?nitions 2.2 and 2.4 of weak solutions are equivalent.

Proof. (?) For all t ?]0,T ? h[, let us choose t1 = t and t2 = t + h, and the test

function ? independent of the time and belonging to W
1,2
0 (K). In this way the

equation (2.2) can be simpli?ed to read?
K

{

dx = 0.

To ?nish this implication we just need to multiply both sides for 1

that (uh)t =

Chapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates

(

?

L2loc

(

. Then we can choose for every t ? [t1, t2 ? h] the function

?(·, t) ? W 1,20 (K) and integrate the equation (2.3) between t1 and t2 ?h , obtaining? t2?h

and then, we just need to let h ? 0. Using Lemma 2.3, the proof is over.

Remark 2.6. For thesigned PME (2.1) the de?nition of weak solutions just has one

small di?erence, it will appear um?1 instead of |u|m?1.

2.2. A priori estimates

Regarding the intrinsic scaling method, the ?rst step is to derive a priori estimates

for weak solutions. We need integral inequalities that measure the behaviour of the

weak solutions near its in?mum and its supremum in the interior of an appropriate

cylinder. At this point we can ignore the equation and it remains to show that

functions that satisfy these inequalities are locally Hölder continuous.

Before presenting these inequalities, let us ?rst de?ne the cylinders mentioned

before. Given a point x0 ? Rd, we denote the n-dimensional cube with centre at x0

and wedge 2? by:

K?(x0) :=
{
x ? Rd : ||x?x0||? &amp;lt;?

}
.

We also de?ne the cylinder of radius ? and height ? &gt; 0, with vertex at (x0, t0),

as:

C(x0, t0,?,?) = (x0, t0) + Q(?,?) = K?(x0) × (t0 ? ?,t0),

with parabolic boundary

?pC(x0, t0,?,?) = ?K?(x0) × (t0 ? ?,t0) ? (K?(x0) ×{t0 ? ?}).

We can, without loss of generality, restrict to cylinders with vertex at the origin

(0, 0). Since the porous medium equation is invariant under displacement of the

coordinate axes, we can change to a generic point (x0, t0) with a simple translation.

This way, although we just prove the results for cylinders with vertex at the origin,

we claim that they are valid for cylinders with vertex at any point, which is necessary

12



2.2 A priori estimates

for the ?nal conclusions. We will also write K? to denote K?(0) and Q(?,?) instead

of C(0, 0,?,?).

We recall that

w+ = max(w, 0), w? = ?min(w, 0)

and introduce the auxiliary function ul± = ±min{±u,±l}.

Finally, it will also be essential to use a piecewise smooth cuto? function in

Q(?,?) ? ?T such that

0 ? ? ? 1, |??| &amp;lt;?, ?(x,t) = 0, x /? K?.

2.2.1. Local energy estimates

The ?rst inequality that needs to be proven is, somehow, a generalization of the

famous Caccioppoli inequality that is often used for elliptic equations. We use this

inequality to control, in some sense, the norm of ?u with the norm of the function

u itself. Since we will only use this estimates for ? such that

? = 0 in ?pQ(?,?),

we will suppose this now, just for simpli?cation. The di?culty without this assump-

tion is the same, but unnecessary terms appear.

Proposition 2.7 (Local energy estimates). Let u be a local weak solution of (PME),

k,l ? R+ and ? a cuto? function. There exists a constant C ? C(m) &gt; 0 such that,

for every cylinder Q(?,?) ? ?T .

At ?rst sight it seems that we are double counting the set where u = l. In fact we

are, but since the integrand function is 0 when u = l there is no problem.

To analyse I1 we de?ne S
h
± = supp(uh ?k)±. Then it is possible to observe that

in Sh±, ((uh ?k)±)t = ±(uh)t, and outside the integrand function is 0. This way, we

can conclude that I1 can be rewritten as? t

Chapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates

Remark 2.8. This estimate could also be extended for the signed PME (2.1) by

considering the constants l and k possibly negative and by changing (ul±)
m?1 to

|(ul±)|m?1.

2.2.2. Local logarithmic estimates

The second estimate also plays a crucial role in the proof. Before proving this

estimate we need to introduce the logarithmic function

?±(s) ? ?±k,c(s) :=

?
?ln

?
? H±s,k(

H±s,k + c
)
? (s?k)±

?
?
?
?

+

, 0 &amp;lt;c &amp;lt;H±s,k,

with

H±s,k := ess sup
x?Q(?,?)

|(s?k)±|

and s a bounded function de?ned in Q(?,?). This function was ?rst introduced in

[1], and since then has been used to prove results concerning the local behaviour

of solutions of degenerate and singular equations. This function has two important

properties that can be proven with simple calculations:

(
?±(s)

)? ?
? 0,

and the second derivative , for s 6= k ± c, is

(
?±(s)

)??
=
((
?±(s)

)?)2
.

If we also consider the previous cuto? function ? to be independent of time in

K?, then we can obtain the following estimate.

Proposition 2.9. Let u be a nonnegative local weak solution of (PME) and k ? R.

There exists a constant C(m) &gt; 0 such that, for every cylinder Q(?,?) ? ?T ,

±(uh) [(?

function in (2.3), and then integrate in time over (??,t) for t ? (??, 0), as in the

Chapter 2 Weak solutions and a priori estimates

2.3. Some technical tools

Throughout the remaining of the proofs, some technical facts will be needed.

They will be essential to establish some results, however they are not directly related

to this theory. In this chapter we will present these important facts without any

proof, so the reader will not loose the focus on the main goal of this text, the

intrinsic scaling method.

endowed with the norm

The following embedding theorem holds [5, page 9].

Theorem 2.11. For p&gt;1, there exists a constant C ? C(d,p), such that for every

v ? V p0 (?t),

||v||pp,?T ? C

V p(?T )
.

Geometric Convergence of Sequences

The following lemma is a fundamental instrument for the iterative schemes that

will be the principal argument in some important proofs.

Lemma 2.12. Let Xn, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., be a sequence of positive real numbers satis-

fying the recurrence relation

Xn+1 ? CbnX1+an ,

where C, b&gt;1 and a&gt;0 are given. If

X0 ? C?

then Xn ? 0 as 0 ??.

A Lemma of De Giorgi

Given a continuous function v : ? ? R and two real numbers k1 &amp;lt;k2, we de?ne

[v ? ki] :={x ? ? : v(x) ? ki}, i = 1, 2,

[k1 &amp;lt;v &amp;lt;k2] :={x ? ? : k1 &amp;lt;v(x) &amp;lt;k2}.

2.3 Some technical tools

Lemma 2.13 (De Giorgi, [3]). Let v ? W 1,1(B?(x0)) ?C(B?(x0)), with ? &gt; 0 and

x0 ? Rd, and let k1 &amp;lt;k2 ? R. There exists a constant C ? C(d), such that

Chapter 3

The method of intrinsic scaling

Continuity results, at a generic point (x0, t0), can be obtained by measuring the

oscillation of the solution in a sequence of nested and shrinking cylinders with vertex

at that point. If we can show that the oscillation converges to zero as the cylinders

shrink to the point, we can derive the continuity of the solution. In this regard, it is

usual to prove that the oscillation is reduced by a factor ? ? (0, 1) in each iteration,

i.e. ?n+1 ? ??n, where ? is the oscillation in the nth cylinder. This method is

named Reduction of Oscillation. We will de?ne and prove rigorously this result in

the following sections.

This iterative procedure can be done using the a priori estimates that we obtained

before. As is explained in my previous work [13], De Giorgi proved the Hölder

continuity for weak solutions of elliptic equations, and the idea now is to try to

generalize his work to parabolic equations.

For some simple equations, as the Heat equation,

ut ? ?u = 0, (HE)

21



Chapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling

the standard parabolic cylinders

Q(R2,R)

re?ect the natural homogeneity between the space and time variables. Indeed, the

heat equation involves one derivative with respect to the time variable, but two

derivatives with respect to the space variables. Consequently, we see that if, u

solves the heat equation, (HE), then so does u(?x,?2t) for ? ? R. This scaling

indicates that the equation remains invariant through a transformation of the space-

time variables that leaves constant the ratio
|x|2
t
.

For more complicated equations like our degenerate parabolic equation (PME),

we need di?erent cylinders.

3.1. A geometry for the equation

The idea behind the method of intrinsic scaling is to perform the iterative process

in cylinders that re?ect the structure/geometry of the equation. These cylinders need

to be constructed taking into account the nature of the degeneracy or singularity,

and the oscillation of the solution itself (thus, the term intrinsic). They should triv-

ially reduce to the standard parabolic cylinders, re?ecting the natural homogeneity

between the space and time variables for the heat equation.

For our equation, (PME), and for most degenerate or singular equations, the

energy and logarithmic estimates are not homogeneous since they involve integral

norms corresponding to di?erent powers. In our case, some undesirable factors, as

um?1, appear. However, if we analyse the estimates in a geometry dictated by its

own degenerate structure, using the rescaled cylinders, we can accommodate the

degeneracy and restore the homogeneity in the energy and logarithmic estimates.

In this regard, we can say that the equation behaves, in its own geometry, like

the heat equation.

If we suppose for a moment that u &gt; 0, we can rewrite equation (PME) in the

following form

u1?m

m
ut ? ?u = 0.

Regardless of the unrealistic assumption, this equation allows us to predict that it is

possible to recover the homogeneity of the function using a scaling factor. Despite

this scaling factor being dependent on the solution itself, it gives us an idea of how

to construct the rescaled cylinders.

22



3.1 A geometry for the equation

The main objective of this chapter is to implement, in a rigorous way, this heuris-

tic reasoning. For that, let us see how to choose the cylinders that better re?ect the

geometry of our equation.

From now on, for brevity, where no confusion is to be feared, we will always

assume that u is a nonnegative local weak solution of (PME).

First let us choose 0 &amp;lt;R &amp;lt;1, such that

Q(4R2??, 2R) ? ?T , 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1,

and de?ne

µ+ := ess sup
Q(4R2??,2R)

u and µ? := ess inf
Q(4R2??,2R)

u.

At this point, we can de?ne the ? as the essential oscillation of the solution u

within this cylinder,i.e.,

? = ess osc
Q(4R2??,2R)

u = µ+ ?µ?.

Finally, let us construct the rescaled cylinder

Q(?1?mR2,R) = KR(0) × (??1?mR2, 0),

which, if we assume

?m?1 &gt; R?, (3.1)

is contained in Q(4R2??, 2R) and consequently in ?T .

23



Chapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling

Indeed, if (3.1) does not hold, we have that the oscillation is comparable to the

radius, ? ? R?(1?m), and the Hölder continuity follows immediately.

This inclusion implies that

ess osc
Q(?1?mR2,R)

u ? ?,

which will be the starting point of the recursive scheme.

We will also assume, without loss of generality, that

µ?&amp;lt;
?

4
. (3.2)

Indeed, if (3.2) is not veri?ed then the equation will not have any degeneracy, but

this case will be studied better in section 4.2 anyway.

3.2. Reduction of the oscillation

At this point, to prove the highly-anticipated reduction of oscillation, we have to

consider two alternatives. The proof will be divided in two complementary cases:

either u is essentially away from its in?mum in Q(?1?mR2,R), or u is essentially

away from its supremum. However, in both cases, we can reach identical conclusions.

Let us state both alternatives in a precise way.

Consider a constant, ?0 ? (0, 1), that will be determined later. Then either, the

?rst alternative,

|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) &amp;lt;u? + ?
2
}|

|Q(?1?mR2,R)|
? ?0, (3.3)

holds, or
|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) ? µ? + ?

2
}|

|Q(?1?mR2,R)|
&amp;lt;1 ??0,

which, since µ+ ? ?
2

= µ? + ?
2
, implies the second alternative

|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ? ?
2
}|

|Q(?1?mR2,R)|
&amp;lt;1 ??0. (3.4)

3.2.1. The ?rst alternative

Let us start to analyse our problem assuming that the ?rst alternative holds.

Proposition 3.1. Assume (3.2) is in force. If the ?rst alternative (3.3) holds , then

3.2 Reduction of the oscillation

Proof. Let us start by de?ning the sequence

Rn =
R

2
+

R

2n+1
, n = 0, 1....,

that converges to R
2
. Then we can construct the family of nested and shrinking

cylinders Q(?1?mR2n,Rn) and, for each cylinder, let us consider a piecewise smooth

cuto? function 0 ? ?n ? 1 satisfying the following assumptions:

?n = 1 in Q
(
?1?mR2n+1,Rn+1

)
; ?n = 0 on ?Q

(
?1?mR2n,Rn

;

|??n| ?

kn = µ

and ? = ?n.

For the left hand side of the inequality, since ul? = max{u,µ?+

the following lower bound can be found:

The next step is to look carefully at all terms in the right hand side and try to get

&amp;lt;kn, so ?[u?l] ? ?[u&lt;kn] = ?[(u?kn)?&gt;0];

3. Where ul? = u, we have ?[(u?kn)?&gt;0] = ?[(ul??kn)?&gt;0]
, but even when ul? = l,

i.e., u ? l &amp;lt;kn, the same result holds: ?[(u?kn)?&gt;0] = 0 = ?[(l?kn)?&gt;0] =

?[(ul??kn)?&gt;0]
. So, we have that ?[(u?kn)?&gt;0] = ?[(ul??kn)?&gt;0]

for all (x,t);

The next step, in which the intrinsic geometric framework is essential, consists

in modifying the time variable, putting t? = ?m?1t , and de?ning

u?l?(·, t?) := u
l
?(·, t), ??n(·, t?) := ?n(·, t).

where

From the de?nition of An, the fact that kn &gt; kn+1, and because ??n = 1 in

Q(R2n+1,Rn+1), we also have that

.

Moreover, if we use Theorem (2.11) for p = 2 and inequality (3.5), we can carry

on these calculations,

Next, dividing the previous inequality by |Q(R2n+1,Rn+1)| = R

obtain

we can rewrite the last inequality as the following recursive relation

with C a constant depending only on d and m. Finally, supposing without loss of

generality that C &gt; 1, let us de?ne ?0 := C
?d+2

2 4?
(d+2)2

2 &amp;lt;1. Since k0 =
?
2
and

u ? ul?, our hypothesis (3.3) is equivalent to the initial condition X0 ? ?0. At this

point, we are in conditions to apply the Lemma 2.12 on fast geometric convergence,

which implies that

Xn ? 0.

Then, we just need to return to the original variables and, noticing that Rn ? R2 ,

we conclude that?????
{

(x,t) ? Q

(
?1?m

(
R

2

)2
,
R

)
: ul?(x,t) ? µ

}????? = 0,
which is equivalent to

ul?(x,t) &gt; µ

?

, a.e in Q

)
.

To ?nish, just notice that if ul?(x,t) &gt; µ
? + ?

4
then ul? = u.

After this proposition, we can easily prove reduction of the oscillation.

Corollary 3.2 (Reduction of the Oscillation). Assume (3.2) is in force. If the ?rst

alternative (3.3) holds, then there exists a constant ?1 ? (0, 1), depending only on

the data, such that

ess sup
Q
(
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? ?1?. (3.6)

Proof. By the previous result, Proposition 3.1,

ess inf
Q
(
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? µ? + ?

,

and thus

ess osc

This way, the corollary follows with ?1 =

4
.

3.2 Reduction of the oscillation

Remark 3.3. This is where more adjustments are needed to extend the result to the

signed PME (2.1). We will divide the problem in 4 cases depending of µ?, and see

what changes in each one.

The ?rst two are very similar, if µ? ? 0 then, independently of the alternative,

the proof is the same. If µ? ???, then ?u is a nonnegative solution and we apply

the method to ?u. Notice that ?u will verify the second alternative instead, but the

result obtained is equivalent. Contrarily of what the reader could think, the change

of equation does not arise any issue because the essential oscillation is the same for

both.

Next we will explore the case where ?? &amp;lt;µ? &amp;lt;??
4
. In fact, for this assumption,

there is no degeneracy on {(ul? ? kn)? &gt; 0}, so everything should work without

signi?cant modi?cations.

(a) Nonnegative solutions (b) Solutions with ?? &amp;lt;µ? &amp;lt;??

Figure 3.1: In these two graphics we want to represent the bounds of (ul? ?kn)?.

However, let us study which adjustments are needed d so the proof remains

formally correct. We start to choose n? such that µ
? + ??

4
? ?

2n?+1
and de?ne

kn = µ? +
?
4

+ ?
2n+n?

.

At this point we can obtain the following lower bound to |ul?|on{(ul??kn)? &gt; 0},

|ul?| ? ?kn ?
?

2n?
. For the upper bound, just notice that |ul?| ? max{|l|,µ+} ?

3?
4

and the rest remains the same. Some minor things would also need to be changed

because of n?, but since it is constant it does not bring major di?culties. Just one

more problem arises, in this case X0 ? ?0 is not equivalent to the ?rst alternative.

However, since k0&amp;lt;
?
2
, the ?rst alternative implies the initial condition for the

convergence.

For ??
4
&amp;lt;µ? &amp;lt;0, again there is no degeneracy on {(ul? ?kn)? &gt; 0} as we can

observe in Figure 3.2.

This is a simpler case, since ul? &gt; 0 and because there exists a n? such that

l &gt; ?
2n?

; the proof follows identically.

29

&amp;lt;µ? &amp;lt;0.

In the last case, µ? = ?
4
, we will prove the same result but for a di?erent ?. We

will choose l = µ? + ?
8
and kn = µ

? + ?

+ ?
2n+4

and use the same techniques of the

third case, ?? &amp;lt;µ? &amp;lt;??
4
, to prove the result for ? = 7

8
?.

3.3. The second alternative

Remember now the second alternative

|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ? ?
2
}|

|Q(?1?mR2,R)|
&amp;lt;1 ??0, (3.7)

and assume that it holds. We will need to prove the reduction of the oscillation

again. Recall that the constant ?0 has already been determined, and we are still

assuming that (3.2) is in force.

Start to notice that, if (3.7) is veri?ed, then there exists a time level

t0 ?
[
??1?mR2,?

?0
2
?1?mR2

]
,

such that ???{x ? KR : u(x,t0) &gt; µ+ ? ?
2

}??? ? ( 1 ??0
1 ??0/2

)
|KR|. (3.8)

We can easily prove this by contradiction. Suppose that (3.8) does not hold for

all t ?
[
??1?mR2,??0

2
?1?mR2

]
, then

|{(x,t) ? Q(?1?mR2,R) : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ?

2
}|

?

)
|KR|

= (1 ??0)
??Q(?1?mR2,R)?? ,

which contradicts (3.7). Although we can prove that the set where u(·, t) is close to

its supremum, it is small not just for t0, but in
[
??0

2
?1?mR2, 0

]
. In detail, we mean

that:

30



3.3 The second alternative

Lemma 3.4. Assume (3.2) is in force. If the second alternative (3.7) holds, then

there exists q ? N, depending only on the data, such that???{x ? KR : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ? ?
2q

}??? ? (1 ?(?0
2

)2)
|KR|,

for all t ?
[
??0

2
?1?mR2, 0

]
Proof. To prove this lemma we will apply the logarithmic inequality (2.6) to the

function (u?k)+ in the cylinder Q(t0,R), with

k = µ+ ?
?

2
and c =

?

2n+1
,

for some n ? N greater than one that will be de?ned later. It is possible to apply

the logarithmic estimate with this constants because we can assume that

H+u,k := ess sup
x?Q(R,t0)

???(u?µ+ + ?
2

)+

??? &gt; ?
4
?

?

2n+1
;

otherwise the lemma would be trivial for the choice of q = 2.

Since u ? 5
4
?, the logarithmic inequality (2.6) implies that

sup

?
KR×{t}

[?+(u)]2?2dx ?
?
KR×{t0}

[?+(u)]2?2dx

+ C

? 0
t0

?
KR

?m?1?+(u)|??|2dxdt. (3.9)

As in the previous proposition, the next step is to bound the terms of the previous

inequality. For that, we will need some initial calculations again. Let us start by

remembering that ?+(u) is de?ned in the whole cylinder Q(t0,R), and it is given by

?+
{H+

u,k
,k, ?

2n+1
}
(u) =

????
???

ln

(
H+
u,k

H+
u,k
?u+k+ ?

2n+1

)
if u &gt; k + ?

2n+1
,

0 if u ? k + ?
2n+1

.

In addition, in this cylinder, we have that

u?k ? H+u,k ?
?

2
, (3.10)

which implies that

?+ ? ln

(
H+u,k

H+u,k ?u + k +
?

2n+1

)
? ln

( ?
2
?

2n+1

)
= n ln(2). (3.11)

Lastly, we will choose our cuto? function 0 ? ?(x) ? 1 de?ned in KR such that,

for some ? ? (0, 1),

?(x) = 1, for x ? K(1??)R and |??| ? (?R)
?1.

31



Chapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling

We are now ready to bound the right hand side terms in (3.9). As ?+(u) = 0 on

the set {x ? KR : u(x, ·) ? µ+ ? ?2}, by (3.8) and (3.11), the ?rst term of the right

hand side of (3.9) is bounded by?
KR×{t0}

[?+]2?2dx ? n2 ln(2)2
(

1 ??0
1 ??0/2

)
|KR|.

Using (3.11) again and the fact that ?t0 ? R
2

?m?1
, we can also bound the second

term as follows:

C

? 0
t0

?
KR

?m?1?+(u)|??|2dxdt ? Cn ln(2)?m?1(?R)?2(?t0)|KR|

? Cn?m?1
1

?2R2
R2

?m?1
|KR|

? Cn

?2
|KR|.

For the left hand side of the inequality we start to integrate in a smaller set,

St =
{
x ? K(1??)R : u(x,t) &gt; µ

+ ?
?

2n+1

}
? KR, t ? (t0, 0).

In this set, we have that ? = 1 and, since ?u + k + ?
2n+1

&amp;lt;?
2n+1

? ?
2

+ ?
2n+1

&amp;lt;0,

H+u,k

H+u,k ?u + k +
?

2n+1

is a decreasing function of H+u,k. Thus, from (3.10),

H+u,k

H+u,k ?u + k +
?

2n+1

?
?
2

?
2
?u + k + ?

2n+1
&gt;

?
2

?
2n+1

+ ?
2n+1

= 2n?1.

Therefore, in St,

[?+(u)]2 ? [ln(2n?1)]2 = (n? 1)2(ln(2))2,

and consequently

sup
t0?t?0

?
KR×{t}

[?+]2?2dx ? (n? 1)2(ln(2))2|St|.

Combining this three estimates, we arrive at

|St| ?

Additionally, ???{x ? KR : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ? ?
2n+1

}???
? |St| + |KR\K(1??)R| = |St| + d?|KR|

32



3.3 The second alternative

is also true and, from this, it holds that

???{x ? KR : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ? ?

for all t ? (t0, 0) ?
[

. Finally, if we choose d? ? 3

that (

)
(1 + ?0) := ? and

C

our lemma follows with q = n + 1.

In fact, we could also state that u is strictly below its supremum in a smaller

cylinder, Q
(
?0
2
?1?m

(
R
2

)2
, R

2

)
.

Proposition 3.5. Assume (3.2) is in force. If the second alternative (3.7) holds,

then there exists a number s0 &gt; 1, independent of ?, such that

u(x,t) ? µ+ ?
?

2s0
?(x,t) ? Q

(
?0
2
?1?m

(
R

2

)2
,
R

2

)
.

Proof. Similarly to the proof of the ?rst alternative, we start by de?ning the sequence

Rn =
R

2
+

R

2n+1
, n = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

and to construct the family of nested and shrinking cylinders Q(?1?mR2n,Rn). We

will also de?ne the cuto? function 0 ? ? ? 1 with resemblant properties:

?n = 1 in Q

(
?0

R2n+1
2?m?1

,Rn+1

)
; ?n = 0 on ?Q

(
?0

R2n
2?m?1

,Rn

)
;

|??n| ?
2n?1

R
; 0 ? (?n)t ?

22n?2

R2
?m?1; ??n ?

22n?2

R2
.

This time, we will use the energy estimates in the cylinder Q
(
?0

R2n

,Rn

)
for

(ul+ ?kn)+, with l = µ+ ?
?

2s0
,

kn = µ
+ ?

?

2s0
?

?

2s0+n
,

and ? = ?n.

The next step is similar to the proof of Proposition 3.1. For the left hand side

33

,

since when |?(ul+ ?kn)+?n| is not zero,

ul+ &gt; kn ? µ

?

2
? ? ?

?

2
=
?

2
.

Let us, one more time, deduce upper bounds for each term on the right hand

side. The following properties will be used:

1. 0 ? µ? ? ?
4
, so u ? 5?

4
and consequently ul+ = min{u,l}?

5?
4
;

2. l = µ+ ? ?
2s0

&gt; kn, so ?[u?l] ? ?[u&gt;kn] = ?[(u?kn)+&gt;0];

3. ?[(u?kn)+&gt;0] = ?[(ul+?kn)+&gt;0]
for all (x,t);

4. (l?kn)+ = ?2s0+n ?

, (ul+ ?kn)+ ?

and (u? l)+ ? ?2s0?1 .

Applying the previous properties and de?nitions of our cuto? functions, we can

obtain the following inequalities for each term on the right hand side of the energy

and again, if we de?ne

Xn =

we can rewrite this as the following recursive relation

Xn+1 ? C42nX

Now, if

by the fast geometric convergence, we can obtain the same conclusions as before,

Xn ? 0

One more time, since ul+ ? µ+ ?

?
2s0

= l implies that ul+ = u, the ?nal result

follows immediately.

At this point, to ?nish this proof, it just remain to prove (3.14).

To simplify the notation, let us introduce the sets

B?(t) =
{
x ? KR : u(x,t) &gt; µ+ ?

?

}
and

B? =
{

(x,t) ? Q
( ?0

.

Therefore, with this notation, (3.14) can be read as

3.3 The second alternative

This inequality means that the subset of the cylinder Q
(

?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)
where u is

close to its supremum µ+ can be made arbitrarily small. To prove this, we will not

only use Lemma 3.4, but also the energy estimate. Let us start by applying the

energy estimate (2.4) to the function (u
µ+

+ ?k)+ = (u?k)+ where

k = µ+ ?
?

2s
, q &amp;lt;s &amp;lt;s0,

and the cuto? function 0 ? ? ? 1 is de?ned in Q
(

?0
?m?1

R2, 2R
)
with the following

assumptions:

? = 1 in Q
( ?0

2?m?1

)
; ? = 0 on ?Q

( ?0
?m?1

R2, 2R
)

;

|??| ?

R
; 0 ? ?t ?

?m?1

.

This time, we will delete the ?rst term in the left hand side, because it is nonnega-

tive, and integrate the second one in a smaller set, Q
(

?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)
. Then, repeating

the same argument, when |?(u?k)+?| 6= 0, u &gt; k = µ+ ? ?2s &gt;
?
2
, we arrive at

In the right hand side, the third term is now 0 because ?{u?µ+} = 0. For the

In addition, we also have that

Chapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling

To ?nish this ?rst part of the proof, notice that Bs ? Q
(

?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)
and, that

in Bs we have |?(u?k)+| = |?(u?k)| = |?u|, and consequently? ?
Bs

|?u|2dxdt ?
C

R2

( ?
2s

)2 ???Q( ?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)??? . (3.15)

In the next step, we will apply Lemma 2.13. If we choose k1 = µ
+ ? ?

2s
and

k2 = µ
+ ? ?

2s+1
, then the lemma gives us that, for all t ? (? ?0

2?m?1
, 0),

?

2s+1
|[u(·, t) &gt; µ+ ?

?

2s+1
]| ? C

?
[? ?

2s
&lt;u(·,t)?µ+&lt;? ?

2s+1
]
|?u|dx.

(3.16)

Additionally, since q ? s?1, by Lemma 3.4 we have that |Bs?1(t)| ? |Bq(t)| ?(
1 ?

(
?0
2

)2) |KR| for all t ? (? ?02?m?1 , 0). Using this inequality we deduce that???{x ? KR : u(x,t) &amp;lt;µ+ ? ?
2s

}??? ? ???{x ? KR : u(x,t) ? µ+ ? ?
2s?1

}???
= |KR|? |Bs?1(t)| ? |KR|? |Bq(t)| ?

(?0
2

)2
|KR|.

Therefore, with our notation, (3.16) implies that

?

CRd+1

?20|KR|

?
Bs(t)\Bs+1(t)

|?u|dx,

for t ? [? ?0
2?m?1

, 0].

At this point, we can integrate the previous inequality over the set [? ?0
2?m?1

, 0],

apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and use (3.15), in this order, to obtain

Simplifying and squaring both sides we have that

|Bs+1|2 ?
C

?40

???Q( ?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)??? |Bs \Bs+1|.

Since this inequality is valid for q &amp;lt;s &amp;lt;s0, we can add them for s = q + 1,q +

2, . . . ,s0 ? 2, i.e.,

s0?2?
s=q+1

C

?40

???Q( ?0

)??? s0?2?

s=q+1

|Bs \Bs+1|.

38



3.3 The second alternative

Then, as
?s0?2

s=q+1 |Bs \Bs+1| ?
??Q( ?0

2?m?1
R2,R

)?? is trivially veri?ed, and Bs0 ?
Bs+1 for s = q + 1,q + 2, . . . ,s0 ? 2, we deduce that

(s0 ?q)|Bs0|
2 ?

C

?40

???Q( ?0

)???2 ,

in other words,

|Bs0| ?
C

?20 (s0 ?q)

2

???Q( ?0
2?m?1

R2,R
)??? .

If we choose s0 so large that

C

?20 (s0 ?q)
1
2

&amp;lt;??0

we prove (3.14) and consequently our lemma.

Finally, we arrive again at the reduction of the oscillation, in this case when the

second alternative holds.

Corollary 3.6 (Reduction of the Oscillation). Assume that (3.2) is in force. If the

second alternative (3.7) holds, then there exists a constant ?2 ? (0, 1), depending

only on the data, such that

ess sup
Q
(
?0
2
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? ?2?. (3.17)

Proof. This proof is similar to the proof of Corollary 3.2. By Proposition 3.5,

there exists s0 ? N such that

ess sup
Q
(
?0
2
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? µ+ ? ?2s0
and thus

ess osc
Q
(
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? µ+ ? ?
2s0
?µ?

=

(
1 ?

1

2s0

)
?.

This way, the corollary follows with ?2 =
(
1 ? 1

2s0

)
.

Remark 3.7. For the signed PME, there is no need to study the second alternative.

As we referred before, if u veri?es the second alternative, then ?u will verify the

?rst alternative and this case is already studied. Notice that the essential oscillation

of u and ?u are the same so it is equivalent to prove the previous corollary for u or

39



Chapter 3 The method of intrinsic scaling

?u. Since the PME is a particular case of the signed PME, it could seem that the

second alternative should never be necessary. However, notice that to prove the ?rst

alternative for the signed PME we used a nonnegative solution of the original PME.

So both alternatives are always necessary.

40



Chapter 4

The Hölder continuity

At this point, using Corollaries 3.2 and 3.6 we can easily prove the general

reduction of oscillation. This result will be the basis of our ?nal iterative scheme

that will prove the Hölder Continuity of weak solutions of the PME.

Proposition 4.1. Assume (3.2) is in force; then there exists a constant ? ? (0, 1),

depending only on the data, such that

ess sup
Q
(
?0
2
?1?m( R2 )

2
,R
2

) u ? ??. (4.1)

Proof. Since ?0

R

2

)
? Q

R

)
,

and by Corollaries 3.2 and 3.6, we just need to choose ? = max{?1,?2} to ?nish

the proof .

4.1. The Recursive Argument

We ?nally prove the Hölder continuity for weak solutions through an iterative

scheme based on all previous results.

Lemma 4.2. There exist constants ? &gt; 1 and ? ? (0, 1), that can be determined a

priori in terms of the data, such that for all 0 &amp;lt;r ? R ,

ess osc
Q(?1?mr2,r)

u ? ??
( r
R

)?
.

Proof. Let us start by de?ning

Rk = c
k
0R, c0 =

2
?
m?1

2

(?0
2

)
&lt;

1

2
,

41



Chapter 4 The Hölder continuity

for k = 0, 1, 2 . . ., where ? is given by Proposition 4.1. Since we are supposing that

?m?1 &gt; R?,

for k = 0, we have that our initial condition

ess osc
Q(?1?mR20,R0)

u ? ess osc
Q(R2??0 ,R0)

u ? ?

is veri?ed.

For k = 1, by (4.1), we also have that

ess osc
Q(?1?mR21,R1)

u ? ess osc
Q(?1?mR21,

R
2 )
u ? ?? = ?1.

Repeating all the process again starting in Q
(
?1?mR21,R1

)
, with ?1 = ??, we

can deduce inductively that, for all k = 0, 1, 2 . . .,

ess osc
Q(?1?mR2k,Rk)

u ? ?k = ?k?.

In addition, for every 0 &amp;lt;r ? R, there exists some k such that

Rc
(k+1)
0 ? r ? Rc

k
0,

so, if we choose ? =
log ?
log c0

&gt; 0, we arrive at

?k+1 ?
( r
R

)?
,

which means that

ess osc
Q(?1?mr2,r)

u ? ess osc
Q(?1?mR2k,Rk)

u ? ?k? ? ??
( r
R

)?
,

with ? = ??1.

Without loss of generality, we can also suppose that ? &gt; 1
2
, which implies that

? ? (0, 1).

Finally, we can easily prove the ?rst part of the main theorem rigorously.

Theorem 4.3. Assume (3.2) is in force. Let u be a nonnegative bounded local weak

solution of (PME) in ?T and M = ||u||?,?T . Then u is locally Hölder continuous

in ?T .

Proof. Let us start by ?xing (x,ti) ? K, i = 1, 2, with t2 &gt; t1 and constructing the

cylinder

S = (x,t2) + Q(R
2,R).

42



4.1 The Recursive Argument

Since ?T there is a constant l such that dist(K; ?p?T ) &amp;lt;l for every compact set

K. This fact implies that if we choose

R =
1

2l
dist(K; ?p?T ),

then S ? ?T and R &amp;lt;1.

Moreover, supposing that

t2 ? t1 &amp;lt;R2,

it is possible to choose

r = |t2 ? t1|
1
2 ? (0,R).

We can then apply Lemma 4.2 to

(x,t2) + Q(?
1?mr2,r)

and conclude that

|u(x,t1) ?u(x,t2)| ? ??(2l)?
(
|t2 ? t1|

1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
= C

(
|t2 ? t1|

1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
.

On the other hand, if t2 ? t1 ? R2, we have that

2l|t2 ? t1|
1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )
? 1,

which implies that

|u(x,t1) ?u(x,t2)| ? 2M ? 2M(2l)?
(
|t2 ? t1|

1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
= C

(
|t2 ? t1|

1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
.

Identically, we can prove the Hölder continuity in the space variables,i.e., for all

(xi, t) ? K, i = 1, 2

|u(x1, t) ?u(x2, t)| ? C
(
|x2 ?x1|

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
.

To ?nish the proof we can use both inequality to arrive at

|u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t2)| = |u(x1, t1) ?u(x2, t1) + u(x2, t1) ?u(x2, t2)|

? C

?
?( |x2 ?x1|

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
+

(
|t2 ? t1|

dist(K; ?p?T )

)???
? C

(
|x2 ?x1| + |t2 ? t1|

1
2

dist(K; ?p?T )

)?
,

for all (xi, t) ? K, i = 1, 2.

43



Chapter 4 The Hölder continuity

We thus complete the application of the intrinsic scaling method, remaining just

to prove this result when (3.2) does not hold.

Remark 4.4. These last proofs just depend on the Reduction of the Oscillation, and

not on the equation itself. Since in the previous remarks we described how to extend

the Reduction of the Oscillation result for the signed PME, at this point we can also

state that weak solutions of the signed PME, (2.1), are locally Hölder continuous.

4.2. Uniformly parabolic equation

Let us consider the case when (3.2) does not hold and the in?mum is not com-

paratively small, i.e.,

µ? &gt;
?

4
&gt;
R?

4
,

and consequently u ? C &gt; 0 in Q(4R2??, 2R).

In this case, the porous media equation does not have any degeneracy. In fact,

it is simply a parabolic equation in Q(4R2??, 2R), and this type of equations had al-

ready been studied in detail [12]. Remember that, in the introduction, we introduced

the evolution equation,

ut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = 0,

with A measurable and subject to the structure conditions???
??
A(x,t,u,?u) ·?u ? ?(x,t,u,?u)|?u|2

|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? |?(x,t,u,?u)||?u|,

where ? and ? are given functions. We also highlighted that, if there exist two

positive constants ?0 ? ?1, such that

?0 ? ?(x,t,u,?u) and ?(x,t,u,?u) ? ?1,

then the equation is considered to be parabolic.

The (PME) can be rewritten in the divergence form as

ut ?div(mum?1?u) = 0 m &gt; 1,

where A = mum?1?u. This means that ?(x,t,u,?u) ? mCm?1 &gt; 0. Since u is

considered to be bounded, we also have that ?(x,t,u,?u) ? mMm?1, which implies

that, in fact, the PME, in this particular case, is uniformly parabolic.

The theory of this type of equation is already well studied, and the proof of the

Hölder continuity of weak solutions can be consulted in [12, chapter 5].

44



4.3 Generalizations

4.3. Generalizations

The intrinsic scaling method is very versatile and we can adjust it to a great

number of singular and degenerate parabolic di?erential equations. As indicated

earlier, the Hölder continuity is solely a consequence of the a priori estimates and,

for this reason, the techniques just presented are rather ?exible and adjustable to a

variety of other equations.

To highlight this versatility and the strength of this method, we will state two of

the most important possible generalizations.

Along the text we already left remarks to demonstrate how we can generalize

the method to the signed PME, although this results may also be generalized to all

quasilinear equations of porous medium type. This type of equations can be cast in

the form

ut ? div A(x,t,u,?u) = b(x,t,u,?u), (4.2)

where Ai and b are measurable functions satisfying the following structure assump-

tions: ???????
??????
A(x,t,u,?u) ·?u ? C0|u|m ? 1|?u|2 ??0(x,t), m &gt; 0;

|A(x,t,u,?u)| ? C1|u|m?1|?u| + ?1(x,t);

|b(x,t,u,?u)| ? C2|?|u|m|2 + ?2(x,t),

for a.e. (x,t) ? ?T . The constants Ci are given and positive and the functions ?i

are nonnegative subject to the integrability conditions ?0, ?
2
1, ?2 ? L

q,r(?T ) with

q,r ? 1 satisfying, for d ? 2,
1

r
+

d

2q
? (0, 1).

As we already mentioned, another equation to which the theory applies is the

p-Laplace equation (PLE). In fact, it can be extended to equations with the full p-

Laplacian type quasilinear structure, i.e., with the form (4.2) verifying the following

structure assumptions:

???????
??????

Conclusion

The goal initially proposed was successfully achieved. Although some ideas were

not presented or even studied we were able to show the powerful method of intrinsic

scaling.

Along this project we went trough di?erent functional analysis techniques, trying

to achieve a balance between explaining them thoroughly without losing the focus of

the general idea. Overall, we believe this balance was successfully achieved, making

this work not hard to follow and at same time self-contained.

Considering the complexity of the method and to ease comprehension we divided

this work in several parts. We initially de?ne weak solutions and with them we reach

to two integral inequalities, named a priori estimates. At this point, the method is

composed by two similar alternatives. Despite of some slight di?erences in the last

part the arguments are essentially the same for both alternatives. We highlight the

fact that the a priori estimates were the building blocks of the theory, all proofs

start by its application. Then, we took advantage of the geometry of the equation

changing our time variable and we start working on the "geometry and time" of

the equation. Finally, after the Reduction of Oscillation has been proved for both

alternatives, we generalized the recursive argument used by De Giorgi in [3], proving

the Hölder continuity of the solutions.

Applying the intrinsic scaling method to the PME not only allowed learning about

the method itself in full depth but also increased our knowledge on the equation and

its geometry.

We would like to emphasize the fact that that the general idea of supporting

this work has been published by J. Urbano in 2008 [15]. In this work the Hölder

continuity of the p-Laplace equation has been proved, in this regard we adapted

the method used to the PME and the signed PME. For that reason, some proofs

are identical but explained in more detail to ease comprehension, while others went

through signi?cant adjustments. Several articles [2, 6, 8, 10, 14] were read and some

47



ideas were adapted, however for some small steps original adjustments were needed.

Unfortunately the method applied does not answer all the questions risen by this

theory. There is still much to discover and many problems to solve. The most famous

unsolved issue related with this theory is the determination of optimal regularity. A

wide number of mathematicians are still trying to understand what is the best Hölder

regularity for general non-negative solutions, in other words, searching what is the

worst possible case. For one-dimension this problem has been already answered, and

optimal regularity was found [16, chapter 9]. In the case of greater dimensions other

results were discovered. The application of the maximum principle made it possible

to determine Hölder estimates with explicit Hölder exponents. Some others results

were discovered [9], however the optimal exponent and regularity remains unknown.

Several hours were also spent around the better understanding of this open prob-

lem, although no considerable advances were made.

Additionally this work contributed to improvement of our knowledge on sev-

eral topics on nonlinear PDEs. Studying the regularity of weak solutions, made us

travel trough fascinating themes, including self-similar solutions, free-boundaries, ?-

nite propagation, radial equivalence for the PME and PLE amongst other themes.

This last subject was of special interest along the year although it has not been

included in this work. As it would deviate from the main topic of this dissertation

and the ?nal result was not completed we decided not to include in this work

In the end remains the feeling that it was impossible to transmit all the knowledge

acquired about all the di?erent areas studied. However, overall we hope with this

manuscript that valuable ideas were clearly transmitted, in an easy and enjoyable

way.
