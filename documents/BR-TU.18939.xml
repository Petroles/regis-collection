Abstract 

Hakea sericea Schrad. (needlebush or silky hakea) is an Australian Proteaceae 

that can be found naturalized in South Africa, New Zealand and southern 

Europe. It presents xeromorphic adaptations in leaves, produces high amounts 

of long-lived, fire resistant seeds that are easily dispersed by both air and water, 

and relys on proteoid roots for enhanced nutrient uptake. Such unique abilities 

allowed H. sericea to proliferate and spread throughout its new habitats, being 

currently considered by regulatory agencies as one of the most agressive 

invaders established in Portuguese territory. Although mechanical and 

biological control have already been extensively tested in South Africa to 

constrain the expansion of H. sericea, in Portugal no large scale attempts have 

been made to control its spreading.  

Here we report the identification of a naturally occuring pathogenic fungus able 

to infect H. sericea that could, in a nearby future, be used as part of an 

integrated control strategy for this invader. The pathogenic agent was isolated 

from leaf spots of infected wild-growing H. sericea found in “Serra de Arga”, in 

north-western Portugal. Microscopical observation revealed typical 

Pestalotiopsis sp. 5-celled spores, whose members have been described as 

pathogenic for Proteaceae species. Thermocyclic amplification of the internal 

transcribed spacer region of the fungal rDNA, using ITS4 and ITS5 universal 

primers, identified the pathogenic agent as Pestalotiopsis funerea. 

Pathogenicity of P. funerea on H. sericea was confirmed with the infection of 

leaf-wounded and non-wounded 6-week-old in vitro-grown plants. Only the leaf-

wounded plants sprayed with P. funerea developed lesions identical to those 

observed in wild-grown specimens.  

A major feature of H. sericea is the ability to produce proteoid roots in response 

to mineral scarcity, mainly N and P. Although the enhanced capacity of proteoid 

roots to absorb inorganic phosphate (Pi) has been mainly attributed to an 

increased root surface area and higher exudation of organic acids and 

phosphatases, here we focused on the Pi uptake system of proteoid roots by 

itself. Uptake experiments with 32Pi suggested the involvement of H+/Pi co-



~ x ~ 

transport systems with Km values of 0.225 and 40.8 µM Pi, both prone to 

competitive inhibition with the analogs phosphite and arsenate, but not 

vanadate. This biphasic Pi uptake system with the highest affinity at 

submicromolar range is likely to confer H. sericea the ability to invade and 

proliferate throughout vast areas of nutrient-poor soils, where survival for most 

plant species seems harder. 

In plants, Pi uptake, translocation through tissues and interorganellar allocation 

is carried out by members of the phosphate transporter (PhT) family. Here we 

report the identification of four PhT genes (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) from H. 

sericea genome. Through phylogenetic analysis and transmembrane domain 

(TMD) prediction, all identified genes were placed in the PhT1 family, meaning 

PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 are probably high- or low-affinity H+/Pi symporters 

involved in Pi transport into the cell. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the 

homology between PhT1 members from different plant species, while PhT2 

members (chloroplastidial H+/Pi symporters) were placed in a cluster of their 

own. Based on phylogeny, we also report the possible existence of new Na+/Pi 

symporter family in plants. The correlation between the expression site of each 

PhT1 with its deduced amino acid sequence has also been studied. 

Phylogenetic studies suggest that the amino acid structure of each PhT1 is 

insufficient to predict the tissue where the protein is likely to be expressed. 

Expression studies of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 in plants grown in high- and 

low-Pi availabity shall provide insights on the Pi transport regulation mechanism 

of H. sericea.

Resumo 

Hakea sericea Schrad. (háquea-espinheiro ou háquea-picante) é uma 

Proteaceae nativa da Austrália que se encontra actualmente naturalizada na 

África do Sul, Nova Zelândia e partes do sul da Europa. Apresenta folhas com 

modificações xerofíticas e produz anualmente uma grande quantidade de 

folículos contendo sementes aladas. Estas sementes são libertadas apenas 

após a passagem de fogo ou morte da planta, sendo dispersas quer pelo ar, 

quer por cursos de água. Associada ao crescimento da H. sericea em solos 

pobres em minerais está a produção de raízes proteóides especializadas na 

captação de fosfato. Estas características únicas permitiram a fixação e 

proliferação de H. sericea em novos habitats, sendo actualmente considerada 

pelo Ministério do Ambiente como uma das invasoras mais agressivas em 

Portugal. Embora na África do Sul tivessem sido testadas formas de controlo 

mecânico e biológico desta espécie, em Portugal não se efectuou ainda 

qualquer tentativa em grande escala de controlar a invasão. 

Aqui reportamos a identificação de um fungo patogénico capaz de infectar H. 

sericea que poderá, num futuro próximo, ser usado como parte integrante de 

um programa de controlo desta espécie. O agente patogénico foi isolado a 

partir de lesões nas folhas de espécimes infectados a crescer nas encostas da 

Serra de Arga, no noroeste português. Por observação microscópica foram 

identificados esporos com cinco células típicos do género Pestalotiopsis sp. A 

amplificação termocíclica das regiões ITS do rDNA do fungo, usando os 

iniciadores oligonucleotídicos universais ITS4 e ITS5 permitiu a identificação do 

agente patogénico como sendo Pestalotiopsis funerea. A patogenicidade de P. 

funerea em H. sericea foi confirmada através da infecção de plântulas 

crescidas in vitro com ou sem pequenas incisões nas folhas. Apenas plantas 

lesadas e infectadas com P. funerea desenvolveram sintomas idênticos aos 

observados em plantas contaminadas presentes na Serra de Arga. 

Um dos principais atributos de H. sericea é a capacidade de produção de 

raízes proteóides em resposta à escassez de minerais, nomeadamente azoto e 

fósforo. Apesar da alta eficácia que estas raízes têm em captar fosfato ter sido 



~ xii ~ 

associada sobretudo ao aumento da área de superfície da raiz e da grande 

capacidade de exsudação de ácidos orgânicos e fosfatases, neste trabalho 

focamo-nos no próprio mecanismo de aquisição de fosfato. Experiências de 

captação de 32Pi sugeriram o envolvimento de um sistema de co-transporte de 

fosfato com protões com valores de Km de 0.225 e 40.8 µM Pi, ambos 

susceptíveis a inibição competitiva pelos análogos fosfito e arsenato, mas não 

por vanadato. Este sistema bifásico de captação de Pi com um sistema com 

uma afinidade invulgarmente alta em plantas deve provavelmente permitir que 

H. sericea seja capaz de invadir e proliferar em áreas pobres em nutrientes, 

onde a sobrevivência de outras espécies aparenta ser dificultada. 

Nas plantas, a captação e translocação de fosfato através de tecidos e 

organelos está dependente de membros da família dos transportadores de 

fosfato (PhT). Neste trabalho reportamos a identificação de quatro genes PhT 

(PiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7) no genoma de H. sericea. Através de análise 

filogenética e predição de domínios transmembranares (TMD), todos os genes 

identificados foram caracterizados como membros da sub-família PhT1. Assim, 

PiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7 são provavelmente simportadores de Pi com protões de 

alta ou baixa afinidade envolvidos na captação de fosfato ao nível da 

membrana celular. A análise filogenética também confirmou a homologia entre 

todos os membros PhT1 analisados. Da mesma forma, todos os membros 

PhT2, simportadores cloroplastidiais de Pi com protões, formaram o seu próprio 

agrupamento filogenético. Reportamos também com base na filogenia, a 

possível existência de uma nova família de simportadores de fosfato com sódio 

em plantas. O estudo da relação entre o local de expressão de cada PhT1  com 

a sua estrutura aminoacídica deduzida sugere que esta é insuficiente para 

determinar o tecido onde a proteína deverá ser expressa. Assim, para que 

possamos conhecer mais profundamente os mecanismos de regulação do 

transporte de Pi em H. sericea será necessário realizar estudos de expressão 

de PiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7 em plantas crescidas em altas ou baixas 

concentrações de fosfato.

1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY 

1.1.1 The Proteaceae 

Proteaceae is a family of woody evergreen plants ranging from almost 

herbaceous sub-shrubs to trees over 40 m tall, though most exemplars are 

small trees or shrubs – some of which are prostrate (Myerscough et al., 2001) 

(Fig 1.1). The 80 genera and 1769 species recognized in the family are 

distributed mainly in the Southern hemisphere and are almost completely 

restricted to Gondwanic continental blocks and fragments (Weston, 2006). The 

family is most diverse in Australia, followed by southern Africa, South America, 

New Caledonia, New Guinea, Malesia, south and east Asia, tropical Africa, 

Central America, Madagascar, New Zealand, Fiji, southern India, Sri Lanka, 

Vanuatu and Micronesia (Johnson and Briggs, 1975; Weston and Crisp, 1996; 

George, 1998) (Fig 1.2). Proteaceae species inhabit a wide variety of habitats, 

ranging from wet tropical, warm subtropical temperate and cool temperate 

rainforests, to semi-arid, arid and saline coastal areas of sandstone soils, to 

Mediterranean climates and alpine areas (Specht et al., 1974; Cowling and 

Lamont, 1998). Furthermore, many Proteaceae are suited with morphological 

and physiological adaptations that enable them to survive in harsh conditions, 

such as nutrient deprivation, fire exposure or excess/shortage of light. 

Proteaceae family presents diverse leaf morphology and anatomy (Johnson and 

Briggs, 1975; Carpenter, 1994; Catling and Gates, 1998). With the exception of 

the mesophytic rainforest species, most Proteaceae are sclerophyllous (from 

Greek skleros - hard and phullon - leaf), presenting mature leaves with high 

amounts of lignin in the sclerenchyma, cutin in thick cuticles, and/or epidermal 

cell walls rich in silica (Beadle, 1966; Dillon, 2002; Jordan et al., 2005). The 

evolution of scleromorphy still remains controversial and it has been considered 

to be an adaptation to seasonal water deficits, especially common in temperate, 

dry summer climates (Edwards at al., 2000).

(A) Alloxylon flammeum is one of the most spectacular Australian native plants. This tall tree can reach up 
to 30 m high in its native habitat, the rainforests of Australia. (B) Grevillea banksii is widely cultivated in its 
shrubby form, although it can be found in the “tree form” in the wild. (C) Leucospermum erubescens is 
native to Zimbabwe and South Africa, occupying a variety of habitats, including scrub, forest, and 
mountain slopes. (D) Hakea laurina is found mostly in sandplains or sandy-clay of south-western Australia 
and is frost tolerant. (E) Protea cynaroides, also known as King Protea, is the National Flower of South 
Africa, and it grows in the southern part of the country. Their unusual flowers are becoming very popular 
for flower arrangements due to their long vase life, making also excellent dried flowers. (F) Stenocarpus 
sinuatus occurs in rainforests of north-eastern Australia and Papua New Guinea. It prefers fairly rich, 
loamy soils but is tolerant of most well drained soils.

Figure 1.2 Native distribution of Proteaceae (adapted from Weston, 2006). 

 
Although scleromorphy was suggested to increase drought tolerance by 

increasing the ability of leaves to tolerate low water potentials, this is poorly 

supported by experimental evidence (Salleo and Nardini, 2000). In fact, cuticle 

thickness is poorly related to resistance to diffusion of water vapour (Kerstiens, 

1996; Riederer and Schreiber, 2001). Alternatively, low nutrient availability 

appears to have been more important than aridity in the evolution of 

scleromorphy in many Southern hemisphere groups (Hill, 1998). Indeed, 

diverse scleromorphic proteaceous fossil leaves occurred in the Paleogene, 

long before the drying of Australia (Carpenter et al., 1994; Carpenter and 

Jordan, 1997; Jordan et al., 1998). The evolution of scleromorphy in response 

to low nutrient environments can be explained by two different models. Loveless 

(1962) proposed that phosphate limitation may originate photosynthates that 

cannot be used metabolically, and thus, would be accumulated as nonfunctional 

sclerenchyma or cuticle. This model would predict nonspecific distribution of 

sclerenchyma in leaves, perhaps concentrated near the site of production, the 

mesophyll. A more recent model proposes that scleromorphy may protect long-

lived leaves in low productivity environments from different types of damage 

and stress (Turner, 1994). This model could explain scleromorphy not only in 

low nutrient environments, but also in dry and cold ones. 



1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY 

~ 6 ~ 

The range of specialized scleromorphic leaf anatomical structures in 

Proteaceae is remarkably wide and includes structures associated with the 

vascular bundles, leaf margins, and mesophyll (Dillon, 2002). Some are also 

associated with the leaf surface exposed to radiation and include cuticles up to 

35 mm thick and five anatomically distinct kinds of lignified layers between the 

epidermis and the mesophyll. Thereby, the solar radiation that reaches the 

mesophyll is attenuated as the amount of tissue and number of surfaces that 

radiation must pass through is largely increased (Jordan et al., 2005). Other 

scleromorphic structures such as osteosclereids, thick mesophyll cell walls and 

bundle sheath extensions prevent leaf collapse (Dillon, 2002) and should also 

increase resistance to piercing and shearing, such as those caused by many 

herbivores (Read et al., 2000). In addition, scleromorphic structures increase 

leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios, which may reduce herbivory (Coley et al., 1985; 

Coley, 1988). Besides scleromorphy as an adaptation to poor-nutrient soils, all 

Proteaceae, except the Persoonioideae and Symphionematoideae, rely on the 

formation of proteoid roots for the uptake of inorganic nutrients (Purnell, 1960; 

Jeffrey, 1967; Lamont, 1972; Malajczuk and Bowen, 1974; Pate, 1994; Jeschke 

and Pate, 1995 and Pate et al., 1998).  

Seeds of most Proteaceae species do not store starch. Instead, they tend to be 

provisioned with resources that establishing seedlings will find scarce in their 

habitat. Usually, seeds from species endemic to rainforests tend to be larger 

and have a very high ratio of lipid/protein (Grundon, 1972; Kuo et al., 1982). 

These energy reserves seem to have high survival value to seedlings under 

rainforest canopies, where light may be in short supply (Pate et al., 1986). 

Conversely, Proteaceae occurring in infertile soils typically have smaller seeds 

with very high amounts of phosphorus, mostly in the form of phytate, which 

functions as foci for the accumulation of a range of cationic reserves, including 

calcium, magnesium, potassium and a number of micronutrients (Pate  

et al., 1986; Stock et al., 1989; Lamont and Groom, 1998). 

Survival of seedlings can be enhanced if germination occurs during the periods 

when the resources for establishment and growth are high and the abundance 

of potential predators and pathogenic organisms are low (Myerscough  



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 7 ~ 

et al., 2001). Many Proteaceae species endemic to fire-prone and infertile 

habitats may control the timing of germination in three different ways. Mature, 

non-dormant seeds may be retained on parental plants in fairly tough and 

woody fruits that open and disperse the seeds usually following a fire or plant 

exposure to extremely hot weather, such as in Hakea sericea and Banksia 

serrata (Whelan et al., 1998; Brown and Whelan, 1999). Seeds in a dormant 

state may be shed onto the soil, with their dormancy being subsequently broken 

by the passage of a fire (dormant soil seed bank), as in Grevillea rivularis 

(Pickup et al., 2003). Finally, after surviving a fire, Proteaceae species such as 

Lomatia silaifolia and Telopea speciosissima are stimulated to flower and 

produce non-dormant seeds that are shed on maturity (Pyke, 1983; Bradstock, 

1995; Denham and Auld, 1999; Denham and Whelan, 2000). Although this 

mode of germination seems to be the rarest, it is widespread along many 

species of monocotyledons (Keith, 1996). 

Dormancy of seeds is common among many Proteaceae growing in fire-prone 

habitats. For example, the released mature fruits of Persoonia maintain seeds 

in a dormant state, which is hard to break artificially (Wrigley and  

Fagg, 1989; Ketelhohn et al., 1996). Also, the dormancy of seeds from 

Conospermum can be broken with the exposure to smoke (Dixon et al., 1995; 

Roche et al., 1997). Proteaceae species endemic to regions where wildfires are 

common are often serotinous, with mature seeds stored in robust fruits, ranging 

from leathery to massive woody structures (Lamont et al., 1991; Read and 

Stokes, 2006). Although protection of seeds from heat is related to wall 

thickness and fruit size (Bradstock et al., 1994), woody fruits also confer 

protection against insect larvae and seed-eating birds (Groom and Lamont, 

1997). Another adaptation developed by some Proteaceae to cope with extreme 

temperatures is the ability to resprout from a lignotuber and/or epicormic shoots 

following a fire (Zammit, 2006). 

Taking into account these abilities, many Proteaceae members tend to fall into 

the category of stress-tolerators as described by Grime (1974), in which plants 

are able to inhabit environments where at least one resource for growth is in low 

supply. 



1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY

1.1.2 Hakea sericea Schrad. 

Hakea Schrader &amp;amp; J.C.Wendl is one of the 80 genera found in the Proteaceae, 

named after Baron Christian Ludwig von Hake (1745–1818), a German patron 

of botany. The genus includes 149 species, most native of Western Australia, 

with around 40 species found in the eastern states (Barker et al, 1999). It is 

accepted that the genus Grevillea is paraphyletic with respect to Hakea, being 

expected that Hakea will soon be transferred into Grevillea (Briggs, 1998). 

Hakea sericea (needlebush or silky hakea), formerly known as H. acicularis or 

H. tenuifolia, is native of the dry sclerophyll forests and heaths on sandstone 

soils and shales of the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and 

Tasmania. It can also be found naturalized elsewhere in Australia, southern 

Europe, South Africa and New Zealand (Weber, 2003). 

H. sericea grows into erect, branched, evergreen woody shrubs that can reach 

up to 5 m high and 3 m across (Fig 1.3.A). It presents xeromorphic adaptations 

in the morphology and anatomy of mature leaves (Fig 1.3.B). The acicular rigid 

leaves (terete), 2-7 cm long with diameter of 1 mm, are protected by a thick 

cuticle, ranging between 12-18 ?m in young leaves and 20-30 ?m in older 

leaves (Teixeira et al., 2008). Leaves are amphistomatous and present sunken 

stomata below the epidermal surface. Mesophyll is characterized by a dual 

layer palisade with increased thickness (Groom et al., 1997). Osteosclereids, 

bone shaped sclereids with columnar middles and small enlargements at both 

ends are inserted between the mesophyll cells. Their presence is required for 

support, since turgor pressure cannot be maintained at high levels within the 

tissues. The leaf core contains vascular bundles randomly scattered and a  

well-developed sclenchymatous bundle sheath surrounding each vein. 

Hermaphrodite white or pink flowers occur in axillary clusters (Fig 1.3.C) from 

winter to early spring – June to September in the Southern hemisphere - and 

fruit development usually begins in October. As in all Hakea species, fruits 

consist of persistent non-fleshy (woody) follicles comprising two dehiscent 

valves, each valve containing one black, compressed, winged seed (Fig 1.3.D). 

H. sericea seeds contain considerable amounts of phosphorus, most in the form

of potassium, sodium, calcium salts and ferric phytate (Mitchell and Allsopp, 

1984). Ranging from 2-3 cm in length (from the point of the seed to the end of 

the wing), seeds are produced annually, stored in the canopy and only released 

after fire or when the plant dies (Bradstock, 1991). While most seeds fall near 

the parent forming dense stands, some are dispersed primarily by wind and 

also by surface water flow (Whelan, 1986). They germinate rapidly following 

release and new viable seeds are produced after 2 years (Dyer and 

Richardson, 1992). Besides seeds, H. sericea may also regenerate from 

rootstocks after fire exposure. 

H. sericea, as most Proteaceae, is able to develop proteoid roots in response to 

mineral scarcity (Fig 1.3.E). This adaptive advantage grants H. sericea the 

ability to propagate in poor-nutrient soils, where survival for most plant species 

seems difficult. Due to its great importance in the establishment of H. sericea 

stands outside its natural range, this feature will be dealt in more detail in 

subsequent sections. 

1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION 

1.2.1 Phosphorus importance and availability 

Phosphorus (P) is one of the 17 essential elements required for plant growth 

(Bieleski, 1973; reviewed by Raghothama, 1999), making up 0.05 to 0.50% of 

the plant dry weight (Schachtman et al, 1998; Vance et al., 2003). This element 

is a component of many key molecules such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, 

and ATP. It also plays an important role in an array of major biochemical 

processes that includes energy generation, photosynthesis, glycolysis, 

respiration, membrane synthesis, enzyme activation/inactivation, redox 

reactions and nitrogen or sulphur assimilation (Theodorou and Plaxton, 1993; 

reviewed by Vance et al., 2003). Moreover, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation 

of proteins is crucial for signal-transduction pathways in plants, and phosphate 

homeostasis in chloroplasts regulates the transport of phosphorylated sugars 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 11 ~ 

across the membrane and the synthesis of starch (Raghothama and 

Karthikeyan, 2005). 

Although phosphorus is abundant in the lithosphere, its physicochemical 

properties and soil chemistry make it, after N, the most frequent limiting 

macronutrient for plant growth (Schachtman et al, 1998; Ticconi and Abel, 

2004). In fact, soil concentrations of soluble P are often up to a 1000-fold lower 

than those of other required ions (Vance et al., 2003). The level of available P in 

soil solution is mainly regulated by its interaction with organic or inorganic 

surfaces in the soil. Organic P (Po) represents 20 to 80% of total P in the soil, of 

which phytic acid is usually a major component (Richardson, 1994). The 

remainder P in soil is found in the inorganic fraction, which contains about 170 

mineral forms of P (Holford, 1997). A large portion of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is 

however unavailable to plants. Insoluble complexes with cations, such as 

aluminum and iron predominate in acidic soils, while calcium complexes are 

usually found in alkaline soil types. Regarding Po, it has to be mineralized to the 

inorganic form before it becomes available to plants. Many soil microorganisms 

release these immobile forms of P to the soil solution, but at the same time they 

compete with plants to obtain the newly available P (Raghothama, 1999). 

The form of P most readily accessed by plants is phosphate. If in fertile soils 

phosphate availability can reach up to 10 µM, in many soils Pi seldom exceeds 

1 µM (Bieleski, 1973; Schachtman et al., 1998). Phosphorus is mainly moved by 

diffusion contrarily to other soluble minerals such as K, which also moves 

through the soil via bulk flow into the sites where uptake by root cells occurs. 

The relative slow rate of Pi diffusion (10-12 to 10-15 m2 s-1) turns the rhizosphere 

depleted of Pi. In order to survive, plants developed strategies for improving 

phosphate uptake (1) aiming the reduction of Pi depletion zone, while at the 

same time (2) increasing the concentration of soluble phosphate at the sites of 

phosphate uptake in roots (Smith, 2002). 

1.2.2 Proteoid root geometry and morphology 

The low availability of Pi in many soils forced plants to evolve mechanisms to 

scavenge for this nutrient. Plant root geometry and morphology directly affect 



1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION 

~ 12 ~ 

the efficiency of Pi uptake, since root systems with higher ratios of surface area 

can explore a larger volume of soil (Lynch, 1995). Following this principle, some 

species have developed proteoid roots, a type of root system specialized in 

nutrient acquisition, particularly phosphorus.  

Proteoid roots were first observed on Banksia spp. growing in the botanical 

gardens in Leipzig, Germany, and were described as roots very much branched 

(Engler, 1894). Nowadays, it is known that proteoid roots are almost ubiquitous 

amongst Proteaceae [from which the term proteoid comes from (Purnell, 1960)], 

and can also be found in some members of Betulaceae (Hurd and Schwintzer, 

1996), Casuarinaceae (Zaïd et al., 2003), Curcurbitaceae (Waters and Blevins, 

2000), Eleagnaceae (Skene, 1998), Fabaceae (Gardner et al., 1982), Moraceae 

(Rosenfield et al., 1991) and Myricaceae (Hurd and Schwintzer, 1997). Proteoid 

roots, also known as cluster roots, can be defined as roots that develop one or 

more discrete clusters of closely spaced rootlets along its length (Watt and 

Evans, 1999). The rootlets are covered with root hairs and arise in contiguous 

rows, opposite to every protoxylem pole. Consequently, species with more 

protoxylem poles present a greater rootlet density (Lambers et al., 2003). In 

Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) cluster roots usually display 1 to 4 rootlets mm-1 root 

axis (Johnson et al., 1994), while in Hakea prostrate they are composed by 100 

rootlets mm-1 root axis (Lamont, 1972). Proteoid roots can be divided in two 

types: simple, as in Hakea and Lupinus and compound as in Banksia and 

Dryandra species (Shane and Lambers, 2005). While simple cluster roots 

display bottlebrush-like morphology, compound cluster roots are an assemblage 

of many simple cluster roots, exhibiting a Christmas-tree-like morphology. 

The proliferation of root clusters greatly increases the root surface area in 

contact with the soil, thus enhancing nutrient uptake. In Hakea obliqua, the 

surface area of a mature proteoid root cluster is increased 25-fold taking into 

account the equivalent mass of axial root (Dell et al., 1980). In Leucadendron 

laureolum the soil volume explored within the boundaries of these rootlets is 

288-fold higher than the equivalent length of non-proteoid root (Lamont, 1983). 

During growing season, root clusters constantly explore new soil regions 

(Lamont, 2003), thus minimising the path length for Pi and NH4, nutrients whose 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 13 ~ 

uptake is only dependent on diffusion (Voorster and Jooste, 1986). It also 

maximises the soil-root water potential gradient pathways for nutrients such as 

Ca, Mg, S and NO3, whose uptake is largely controlled by bulk flow (Gould, 

1998). 

1.2.3 Proteoid root exudates 

Coupled with increased ratios of surface area to volume, proteoid roots are also 

able to chemically modify the surrounding soil (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). 

According to Grierson and Attiwill (1989), the proteoid root mat of Banksia 

integrifolia enhances the uptake of nutrients by promoting the chemical 

modification of soil environment. By exuding carboxylate organic anions, acid 

phosphatases, phenolics, mucilages and water, many soil nutrients that were 

previously inaccessible to the plant become available for uptake (Fig 1.4) 

(Lambers et al., 2006). 

 

Figure 1.4 Model for root-induced inorganic phosphate (Pi) and organic phosphate (Po) 
mobilization in the rhizosphere by exudation of carboxylates, protons and acid 
phosphatases.  

Carboxylates may be released via anion channel, but the mechanism used for phosphatases release is 
unknown. Carboxylates mobilize both Pi and Po, while phosphatases hydrolyze Po compounds into Pi. 
Protons are released in the rhizosphere through H+-ATPase pumps, at the expense of ATP. Available Pi is 
transported from the rhizosphere to the cytoplasm through Pi transporters in symport with protons 
(adapted from Lambers et al., 2006). 



1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION 

~ 14 ~ 

Many plant species export organic anions into the soil in response to P 

privation, since organic anions can mobilize P by chelating soil minerals that are 

bound to this nutrient (Shane and Lambers, 2005). The carboxylates export 

rates from roots of proteoid species are usually several times higher than those 

described for non-proteoid species (Jones, 1998). In fact, proteoid species are 

able to export amounts of carbon that range from 11% (Gardner et al., 1983) to 

greater than 23% (Dinkelaker et al., 1989) of the total plant dry weight. The 

organic anions pattern in root exudates varies among species. The release of 

citrate, as well as small amounts of malate and succinate, by proteoid roots of 

Lupinus albus mobilizes precipitates of Pi, both in acidic (Gardner et al., 1982) 

and calcareous soils (Dinkelaker et al., 1989). Conversely, exudates of Hakea 

undulata are mostly composed of malate and fumarate, while citrate is poorly 

represented (Dinkelaker et al., 1997). Interestingly, plants seem to perceive the 

chemistry of the soil where they grow. For example, the production of proteoid 

roots in seedlings of both Telopea speciosissima and Banksia ericifolia was 

found to be directly dependent on the level of phosphate supplied (Grose, 1989; 

Handreck, 1991). Also, the pattern of carboxylate exudation in Banksia grandis 

is affected by the form of phosphate added to the soil (Lambers et al., 2002). 

Tri- and dicarboxylates (citrate, 60%; malate, 25%; trans-aconitate, 14%) are 

the major organic anions in root exudates when P is supplied as Al-phosphate. 

In contrast, when P is supplied as Fe-phosphate, besides the same tri- and 

dicarboxylates (31, 14 and 12%, respectively), plants also release 

monocarboxylates (lactate, 30%; acetate, 12%).  

Before becoming available to plants, soil Po must be first hydrolyzed to Pi 

(George et al., 2002). Acid phosphatases can hydrolyse a wide range of Po 

compounds (Tarafdar and Claassen, 2001), including phosphate mono- and  

di-esters, both common Po forms in soils (Sumann et al., 1998). The release of 

acid phosphatases to the rhizosphere in response to P low availability is a 

universal response by plants (Duff et al., 1994). In accordance, proteoid-forming 

species such as Lupinus albus (Gilbert et al., 1999; Wasaki et al., 2003) and 

Hakea undulata (Dinkelaker et al., 1997) can exude large amounts of acid 

phosphatases to the rhizosphere in response to P scarcity, during several hours 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 15 ~ 

or even days (Miller et al., 2001). In Lupinus albus, a novel acid phosphatase is 

specifically induced as a response to low internal P concentration (Gilbert  

et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2001). 

The efflux of large amounts of carboxylates is linked to a modified organic anion 

metabolism, in which both enhancement and reduction of the specific activity of 

several key enzymes occur (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). The carbon 

required for exudation is derived from both photosynthetic (65%) and dark CO2 

(35%) fixation (Johnson et al., 1994). Dark CO2 fixation occurring in roots is 

mediated by several enzymes including carbamoyl phosphate synthase  

(EC 6.3.4.16) (McClure et al., 1983) and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole  

(EC 4.1.1.21) (Boland and Schubert, 1982). The anaplerotic pathway seems to 

contribute mostly to this phenomenon, in which phosphoenolpyruvate 

carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31; PEPC) catalyzes the carboxylation of 

phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form oxaloacetate (Vance et al., 1983; Johnson 

et al., 1994). Studies in Lupinus albus (Uhde-Stone et al., 2003), Brassica 

napus (Moraes and Plaxton, 2000) and Sesbania rostrata (Aono et al., 2001) 

have shown that enhanced CO2 fixation in roots is coupled with an increased 

specific activity of PEPC, as well as malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37; 

MDH), and citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1; CS), which are responsible for the 

synthesis of carboxylate intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)  

(Fig 1.5). Moreover, reduced degradation or utilization of citrate is also involved 

in carboxylates exudation. In cluster roots of Lupinus albus the activity of 

aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3; Aco), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate 

to isocitrate, is reduced (Neumann et al., 1999; Kihara et al., 2003), thus 

resulting in more citrate available for exudation (Fig 1.5). The reduced activity of 

Aco also leads to lower respiration rates, which are an indirect measure of flux 

through the TCA cycle (Johnson et al., 1994; Neumann et al., 1999). Despite 

the large quantities of organic acids produced and exuded by proteoid roots, the 

mechanism by which exudation actually occurs is not yet fully understood. 

Efflux of carboxylates may be mediated by anion channels such as chloride 

channels and MATE (Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion) (Johnson et al., 1996; 



1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION 

~ 16 ~ 

Vance et al., 2003). Alternatively, carboxylates could be packaged in vesicles 

and released into the rhizosphere by exocytosis (Watt and Evans, 1999). 

The export of organic acid anions coincides with a marked acidification of the 

rhizosphere due to the release of protons via plasma membrane ATPase  

(Fig 1.4) (Dinkelaker et al., 1995; Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). This 

phenomenon is mainly attributed to the fact that Pi can only be acquired by 

roots through an energy-mediated co-transport process driven by protons 

(Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; Sakano et al., 1992). However, the extrusion of 

protons along with carboxylates into the rhizosphere may also be triggered to 

prevent the inhibiting effect of cytosolic acidification (Sakano, 2001). Plant 

glycolysis only occurs when the cytoplasm is sufficiently alkaline to stimulate 

PEPC activity. Since the synthesis of organic anions generates an excess of 

protons, their extrusion would prevent glycolysis inhibition, ultimately resulting in 

the production of more organic anions. The resulting acidification of the 

rhizosphere may also enhance the hydrolysis of organic phosphate by acid 

phosphatases (Braum and Helmke, 1995). 

Other soil chemical modifications promoted by proteoid roots include the 

production of anionic mucopolysaccharides and phenolics by root cap cells that 

act in the same way as carboxylates, although to a much lesser extent (Dell  

et al., 1980; Neumann and Römheld, 2001; Guppy et al., 2005). Exudation of 

these compounds is also enhanced under P deficiency (Grimal et al., 2001; 

Neumann and Römheld, 2001; Juszczuk et al., 2004), contributing for the 

enhanced Pi availability in soil. Furthermore, the distance that nutrients must 

diffuse to reach the root surface is reduced by mucilage, since it contributes to 

the binding of soil particles, thus improving the soil root contact area (Watt  

et al., 1994). Although phenolics can also contribute to P mobilization, their 

ecophysiological role seems to be the prevention of microbial breakdown of 

exuded carboxylates, since phenolics slow down fungal metabolism by 

stimulating sporulation (Neumann and Römheld, 2001; Weisskopf et al., 2006). 

Examples of phenolics that are exuded into the rhizosphere are piscidic acid 

from roots of Cajanus cajan (Ae et al., 1990), alfafuran from Medicago sativa

roots (Masaoka et al., 1993), and isoflavonoids from cluster roots of white lupin

Figure 1.5 Model for modified anion metabolism leading to the carboxylates efflux in 
cluster roots of Lupinus albus.  

The stimulated metabolic reactions and sequences are depicted in green and those inhibited are depicted 
in red. Organic acid extrusion requires additional carbon. CO2 fixation is achieved by the increase of PEPC 
activity. The enhancement of MDH and CS activities coupled with a decrease on Aco and ACL activities 
lead to an accumulation of citrate. Citrate is exported along with protons to the rhizosphere, enhancing Pi 
availability. Abbreviations: ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; Aco, aconitase; CS, citrate synthase; HK, hexokinase; 
MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase;

Many plant species release a wide range of compounds as a response to 

nutrient scarcity, but only proteoid-forming species seem to achieve it through 

exudate bursts (Lambers et al., 2006). Young cluster roots only release small 

amounts or even no material into the rhizosphere. However, when rootlets 

reach maturity they export large quantities of carboxylates for a short period of 

2-3 days, followed by an almost absence of exudation. After uptaking the newly 

available Pi, proteoid rootlets become unnecessary and become senescent 

(Dinkelaker et al., 1995). This process is continuously repeated and can be 



1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION 

~ 18 ~ 

explained by two main reasons: (1) since P has a low diffusion coefficient, a 

rapid and concentrated burst in newly explored soil areas would benefit more 

the plant than a long-term, continuous but lower level of exudation, and (2) it 

may prevent soil bacteria from completely metabolizing the exudates before 

they enhanced P uptake (Skene, 1998). 

When a plant has some roots in contact with moist soils and others with dry soil, 

water may flow from moist to dry patches (Lambers et al., 2006). Plants can 

deliberately release water into superficial dry soil horizons to enhance the 

mobility of Pi mobilized by other exudates, in a process named hydraulic 

redistribution (Burgess et al., 1998, 2000). Furthermore, the hydration of the 

proteoid rhizosphere also seems to increase the longevity of rootlets in a dry 

environment (Pate and Dawson, 1999). 

1.2.4 Association between proteoid roots and microorganisms 

More than 90% of land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal 

fungi. While plants provide organic C compounds to the fungi, the mycelium is 

responsible for increasing the soil volume explored by the roots, playing an 

important role in plant mineral nutrition (Bolan, 1991; Smith and Read, 1997). 

Within the same plant species, uptake of P in roots colonized by mycorrhizal 

fungi can be several times higher than in nonmycorrhizal roots (Smith and 

Read, 1997). Both mycorrhizas and cluster roots seem to have similar 

functions, increasing the area for absorption of water and inorganic nutrients 

from the soil (Malajczuk and Bowen, 1974; Lamont, 1982, 1984). Although fungi 

may be found in association with roots from Proteaceae species, no symbiotic 

mycorrhizas appear to be formed (Reddell et al., 1997). 

Bacteria may also be found associated with roots from Proteaceae. The 

possible enhancement of nutrient uptake resulting from this interaction has 

been studied by Wenzel et al., (1994). Bacteria isolated from proteoid and  

non-proteoid roots of Telopea speciosissima enhanced the solubilisation of 

calcium phosphates in culture. However, the ecophysiological importance of this 

phenomenon is still unknown, since it was not shown that bacteria render 

insoluble soil phosphates available to plant uptake. 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 19 ~ 

The role of microorganisms in cluster root initiation has also been studied. 

Lamont and McComb (1974) showed that formation of cluster roots in Hakea 

prostrata growing in autoclaved sand was only achieved after the addition of 

non-autoclaved soil extract. Malajczuk and Bowen (1974) also demonstrated 

that Banksia grandis grown in two ?-irradiated soil types only produced proteoid 

roots after inoculation with a proteoid root extract. At present, proteoid root 

formation is suggested to be triggered by auxins released by free-living 

rhizosphere bacteria (Glick et al., 1994). The application of exogenous synthetic 

auxins to Lupinus albus induced proteoid root formation, even when plants were 

grown with high P supply (Gilbert et al., 2000; Skene and James, 2000). In 

contrast, inhibitors of auxin transport suppressed cluster root growth in  

P-deficient Lupinus albus. The soil layers rich in decomposing organic matter 

and presenting an active nutrient release usually have higher bacteria content. 

Being induced by bacteria, proteoid roots would be preferentially developed in 

soil portions where nutrient concentration is potentially higher. Thus, the 

exploration of soil regions completely depleted from Pi will be limited even for 

proteoid-forming species. 

1.3 HAKEA SERICEA AS AN INVADER OF NATURAL HABITATS 

1.3.1 Biotic invasions 

According to Elton (1958), a biotic invader can be defined as an organism that, 

after arriving to a new habitat, proliferates, spreads and persists over time. 

Biotic invasions can occur naturally, but in the last 500 years their frequency 

and number of species involved have dramatically increased, as a result of 

human activity, such as migrations and commerce (Wells et al., 1986; di Castri, 

1989). As a consequence, at the present it is difficult to find habitats on earth 

free of species introduced by humans (Mack et al., 2000). Fortunately, not every 

species introduced in a new habitat become invaders. Most are quickly 

eliminated by physical and biotic agents present at the arriving site (Kruger  

et al., 1986; Mack, 1995). Some survive and reproduce, but their descendants 

proliferate only for a few generations before becoming extinct. Consequently, 



1.3 HAKEA SERICEA AS AN INVADER OF NATURAL HABITATS 

~ 20 ~ 

only a very small number of species eventually persist and adapt to the new 

habitat, becoming naturalized. Finally, from this group of survivalists, only a few 

will become invaders and even those may take decades before becoming 

abundant and widespread. One example is the Brazilian pepper (Schinus 

terebinthifolius), a bush that grows in dense stands excluding the growth of any 

other vegetation. Although introduced to Florida in the 19th century, only in the 

early 1960s it became invasive (Schmitz et al., 1997). Different theories have 

been proposed to explain this lag phase: (1) some populations are so small and 

isolated that even in exponential growth phase they may not be detected - this 

could be wrongly perceived as a lag phase (Crooks and Soule, 1996);  

(2) genetic variation along generations may favour new genotypes allowing 

species to better cope with environmental factors in the new habitat – the lag 

phase would reflect the period needed for emergence of these new genotypes 

(Baker, 1974; Crooks and Soule, 1996) and finally, (3) environmental conditions 

may alter during time, triggering the spreading of naturalized species 

(Simberloff, 1988). 

Concerning the threat to global biodiversity, the alteration of the earth biota 

caused by invasive species is the second most important factor following the 

direct destruction of habitat (Walker and Steffen, 1997). The ecological 

alterations include changing the role of autochthon species in communities, 

disrupting evolutionary processes, and causing changes in relative abundances, 

ultimately leading to extinctions (Cronk and Fuller, 1995; Rhymer and 

Simberloff, 1996). In many cases, the consequence of a biotic invasion is the 

complete replacement of native species by the invader. Examples are found in 

northern Australia, where 80.000 ha of heterogeneous tropical wetland habitat 

were transformed into a uniform Mimosa pigra shrubland (Braithwaite  

et al., 1989). Also, in Florida, USA, the Australian paperbark tree (Melaleuca 

quinquenervia) has claimed 160.000 ha, replacing cypress and sawgrass 

amongst other native species. In Cape Province, South Africa, eucalypts, pines, 

Acacia, and Hakea spp. have threatened the survival of many endemic species 

by removing enormous amounts of water from soil (van Wilgen et al., 1996). 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 21 ~ 

Invasive plants have developed diverse features that confer them adaptive 

advantages over natives. Many limit the light, water or minerals available to the 

native plants; some release phytotoxic agents into the soil; while others are just 

able to grow faster or stronger following a natural disaster. For example, 

Carpobrotus edulis, a succulent mat-former introduced to California, usurps the 

water in the soil, making it unavailable for native species (D’Antonio and Mahall, 

1991). 

When plant invasions are detected early, it is possible to eradicate them 

(Simberloff, 1997). In many cases, however, early eradication is not followed 

because regulatory agencies feel that control is neither worth the trouble nor the 

expense. Often, agencies tend to act only when the alien species becomes 

completely widespread and invasive. Unfortunately, in most cases, once the 

invasion is fully established, it is extremely difficult to control (Simberloff, 1997). 

1.3.2 Hakea sericea as a biotic invader 

Native from south-eastern Australia, Hakea sericea was introduced to South 

Africa during the 1930s as a hedge plant (Neser and Fugler, 1978). However, 

its copious seed production and serotiny, associated with high seed longevity in 

the canopy and efficient seed dispersal, allowed H. sericea to rapidly proliferate 

and disperse throughout the new habitat, invading thousands of hectares of 

fynbos in South Africa (Richardson et al., 1989). Moreover, the woody follicles 

produced by H. sericea only release the trapped winged seeds after fires or 

upon the death of plants (Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986; Bradstock, 1991). 

Since the fynbos ecosystem is fire-prone, meaning that the fynbos vegetation 

relies on periodic fires for its own regeneration, the invasion by H. sericea has 

been strongly intensified (van Wilgen, 1981; van Wilgen and Richardson, 1985). 

The presence of H. sericea by itself promotes fires, since it increases fuel loads, 

while at the same time decreases herbaceous fuel moisture (Versfeld and van 

Wilgen, 1986). By forming dense and impenetrable stands of shrubs that put in 

jeopardy the autochthon fynbos vegetation, H. sericea shortly became a major 

problem in most costal mountain ranges and catchments of the Western Cape 

Province (Richardson et al., 1989; Gordon, 1999).

In 1970, a biological control programme against H. sericea focusing the use of 

insects was initiated (Neser and Annecke, 1973; Gordon, 1999). The 

programme consisted in the introduction of non-autochthon species such as 

Carposina autologa, a moth whose larvae feed on H. sericea seeds, and 

Erytenna consputa, a weevil that destroys the developing fruits of H. sericea. 

Mechanical methods (felling and fire) were also tested and cleared large 

invaded areas. However, problems occurred with high intensity burning due to 

excessive fuel loads, which led to damage of the soil, seedbanks and soil 

microbial populations (Cilliers et al., 2004). At present, control of H. sericea in 

South Africa is still dependant on seed-feeding insects, although their impact is 

severely constrained by numerous factors, notably fires. 

H. sericea was also introduced to Portugal as a hedge plant to form fence lines 

or windbreaks, due to its dense and impenetrable cover. It is currently 

considered by regulatory agencies one of the most invasive plant species 

established in Portuguese territory (Diário da República, Decreto-Lei nº 565/99, 

21 de Dezembro). The same morphological and physiological traits that made it 

invasive in South Africa allowed H. sericea to spread in Portugal, mostly 

throughout the north-west region (Fig 1.6).

Arga” in northern Portugal. 



CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

~ 23 ~ 

Until now, no large scale attempts have been made to control H. sericea 

spreading, although mechanical control methods have been tested with relative 

success in the military field of Stª Margarida (south of Tagus river, Santarém 

district) (Espírito-Santo and Arsénio, 1999).  

The aim of the present study is (1) to identify a pathogenic agent able to infect 

H. sericea, which could be used as a biological control agent of the invader, as 

well as (2) to better understand the ecophysiological features underlying the 

ability of H. sericea to invade new territories, specifically, its capability to survive 

in poor nutrient soils.

CHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL 

~ 37 ~ 

ABSTRACT 

Hakea sericea (Proteaceae) is native to south-eastern Australia and has been 

considered as an invader of natural habitats. In northern Portugal, dense stands 

are rapidly spreading after forest fire. Unusual leaf spots were observed on 

naturally growing plants. Infected plants exhibited reddish leaves bearing black, 

1-3 mm circular lesions. Leaf sections containing necrotic lesions were plated 

onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and eight fungal isolates were obtained. Pure 

cultures exhibited pinkish mycelium, bearing compact acervuli that contained 

black slimy spore masses. Microscopic observation revealed typical 

Pestalotiopsis sp. 5-celled spores (3 coloured median and 2 hyaline end cells) 

with 3-4 apical and 1 basal appendages. Genomic DNA from fungi isolates was 

purified and used in thermocyclic amplifications with ITS5 and ITS4 internal 

transcribed spacer (ITS) universal primers. The amplified sequences from all 

fungal isolates were identical to each other and only four base pair different 

(99.3% similarity) from Pestalotiopsis funerea. To confirm the pathogenicity of 

P. funerea on H. sericea, leaf-wounded and non-wounded 6 week-old in vitro 

plants were sprayed with a suspension containing 105 spores per mL or with 

sterile water. After 6 days, only leaf-wounded plants infected by P. funerea 

exhibited lesions identical to those observed in field plants, bearing fungus 

spores identical to those from original isolates. Members of Pestalotiopsis 

genus have been described as pathogenic for Proteaceae species. In South 

Africa where H. sericea invasion has become a problem, its biological control 

has been successfully achieved using Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The 

identification of naturally occurring pathogenic fungi in portuguese H. sericea 

could allow the design of an integrated control strategy for this invader.

2.1 INTRODUCTION 

Biotic invaders can be defined as species that outside their natural range are 

still able to proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment 

(Mack et al., 2000). Invasive exotic species threaten native biodiversity (Wilcove 

et al., 1998) and alter fundamental ecological properties. They can change the 

abundance and distribution of species in a community and modify ecosystem 

physical features, such as nutrient cycling and plant productivity (Bertness, 

1984; Vitousek, 1990). Moreover, invasive species have been identified as the 

second greatest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss (Mack et al., 2000) and 

annually cost up to $120 billion in the United States alone (Pimentel et al., 

2005). 

Control of invasive exotic species is usually achieved through three main 

approaches applied singly or in combination: chemical, mechanical, and 

biological control. Introduced about 1895 (Hansen, 1921), chemical control 

probably remains the chief tool in combating invasive species (Mack et al., 

2000). Herbicides usually inhibit the growth and establishment of plants by 

interfering with various physiological and biochemical pathways (Inderjit, 2004). 

Chemical control, however, has been too often related with health issues for 

humans and non-target species (Acquavella et al., 1999). Moreover, if the goal 

is to control an invasive species in a vast natural area, the cost of chemical 

methods alone can be prohibitive. Finally, the frequent evolution of plant 

resistance and the necessity of repeated applications often make continued 

chemical control impossible (Mack et al., 2000). Mechanical methods for 

controlling invasive species have shown to be quite effective (Roberts et al., 

1996; Alemán, 2001) and encompass an array of tools ranging from harrows to 

brushes and hoes to disrupt weed growth (Tillett, 1999). However, equipment 

expenses, rough landscapes, and the geographic scale of some weed 

infestations frequently render mechanical control impossible (Mack et al., 2000). 

The perception of high economic, health and environmental costs of both 

chemical and mechanical weed control has stimulated interest in biological

control (Louda et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2005). This type of control is seen as an 

especially attractive option for large natural areas, such as parks, reserves, 

national forests, and open rangelands (Center et al., 1995). Biological control 

methods include crop competition, allelopathy, and more frequently, the 

introduction of specific insect predators, herbivores and plant pathogens 

(Inderjit, 2004). Some biological control projects have succeeded in restraining 

very widespread, damaging infestations at acceptable levels with minimal costs 

(Westbrooks, 1998; Britton et al., 2002). 

Hakea sericea Schrad. (Proteaceae) is native of south-eastern Australia and 

has been considered as an invader of natural habitats. It grows into large woody 

and dense shrubs, with 6 cm-long rigid leaves. These dense stands of  

H. sericea transform the natural landscape, thus modifying many ecosystem 

processes and reducing the diversity of indigenous species (Richardson et al., 

1989). In Portugal, it was first introduced as a hedge plant to form fence lines or 

windbreaks, because of its dense and impenetrable cover, but became an 

ecological problem due to its high adaptability to climatic conditions and 

capacity to survive to frequent forest fires. Actually, aspects of H. sericea 

reproduction and regeneration turn this species as one of the most dangerous 

and aggressive invader in Portugal. Plants are able to regenerate not only from 

seeds but also from rootstocks. Winged seeds are produced in large number 

and held in woody follicles until the parent plant dies. When parent shrubs are 

killed by fire, the release of the large accumulated seed store is strongly 

promoted. Most seeds fall near the parent forming dense stands, but some are 

dispersed by wind. Seeds germinate rapidly and viable seeds are produced 

after 2 years upon germination (Dyer and Richardson, 1992). Mechanical 

control methods have been tested with some success in the military field of 

Stª Margarida (south of Tagus river, Santarém district), being, to our knowledge, 

the only form of control practiced in Portugal (Espírito-Santo and Arsénio, 

1999). Despite the promising results, this control method cannot be applied in 

the northern region of Portugal, where the landscape is much rougher. The aim 

of our work is to identify a pathogenic agent able to infect H. sericea, which 

could, in a nearby future, be used for the biological control of the invader.

2.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.2.1 Plant material 

Mature follicles (&gt;2 years old) from Hakea sericea adult plants were collected in 

“Serra de Arga” mountains (430-450 m elevation), northern Portugal, centered 

at 8º 45' 06'' W, and 41º 51' 20'' N. After opening the follicles at 125ºC for 1 h, 

the recovered seeds were water-embedded overnight. Seed surface was 

disinfected by 35% (v/v) H2O2 immersion for 15 min, followed by thorough 

rinsing using sterile water. To break dormancy, seeds were placed for one week 

at 4ºC in the dark. Sterile H. sericea seedlings were obtained by germinating 

seeds in MS medium (0.185 g.L-1 MgSO4.7H2O, 0.22 g.L-1 CaCl2.2H2O, 

0.95 g.L-1 KNO3, 0.825 g.L-1 NH4NO3, 0.085 g.L-1 KH2PO4, 16.9 mg.L-1 

MnSO4.H2O, 0.83 mg.L-1 KI, 0.025 mg.L-1 CoCl2.6H2O, 8.6 mg.L-1 ZnSO4.7H2O, 

0.025 mg.L-1 CuSO4.5H2O, 6.2 mg.L-1 H3BO3, 0.25 mg.L-1 Na2MoO4.2H2O, 

27.8 mg.L-1 FeSO4.7H2O, 41.3 mg.L-1 Na2EDTA.2H2O, 20 g.L-1 sucrose and 

7 g.L-1 agar, pH 6.0), using a 16/8 h photoperiod under cool white fluorescent 

light (150 ?W.cm-2), at 25ºC in a growth chamber. To prevent dehydration of the 

medium, cotton corks were partially flamed and double capped with aluminum 

foil. Seedlings were allowed to develop for 6 weeks. 

2.2.2 Fungal material 

Fungal isolates were obtained from circular lesions on the mature leaves of 

diseased plants of H. sericea grown in “Serra de Arga”. Leaf sections containing 

necrotic lesions were plated onto PDA and mycelium was allowed to grow in the 

dark at 25ºC, for 20 days. Following acervuli formation, spores were harvested 

with a sterile needle and plated onto new sterile plates of PDA. The process 

was systematically repeated (up to 6 times) until pure cultures were obtained. 

Spores were observed under a light microscope for genus identification. 



2.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 42 ~ 

2.2.3 Inoculation 

Spore suspensions were obtained from 7-day-old Petri dish pure cultures by 

washing the mycelium with sterile deionised water. Spore concentrations were 

adjusted by dilution after counting with a haemocytometer. Leaves of in vitro 

grown 6-weeks-old plants, either intact or induced-wounded by a bisturi, were 

sprayed with 1 mL of inoculum containing 105 spores. Incubation proceeded as 

used for growing (16/8 h photoperiod, at 25ºC) for 6 days. Control plants (intact 

or induced-wounded) were treated with sterile deionised water. 

2.2.4 Extraction of fungal DNA 

Fungal mycelium was obtained from 200 mL cultures (0.4 g.L-1 sucrose, 

0.04 g.L-1 yeast extract, 0.04 g.L-1 peptone, 0.1 g.L-1 MgSO4, 0.108 g.L-1 

KH2PO4) (Mathur et al., 1950), incubated three days at 28ºC, with shaking 

(140 rpm). After collecting on Scott paper, the mycelium was ground to a fine 

powder in liquid N2 and stored at -20ºC. Fungal gDNA was extracted using the 

DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier’s instructions. Briefly, 

after cell lysis and protein and polysaccharide precipitation, the lysate 

containing DNA was applied to a QIAshredder™ Mini Spin Column (Qiagen). 

DNA was washed using a kit provided washing buffer and 100 µL of Buffer AE 

(10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 9.0) were used for eluting the DNA. After 

incubating the DNeasy® membrane for 5 min at 25ºC, DNA was recovered by 

centrifugation for 1 min at 6000 g. 

2.2.5 Spectrophotometric quantification of DNA 

Quantification of DNA was performed spectrophotometrically by measuring the 

A260 of sample solution on a Cary 1E UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian). For 

estimation of DNA concentration, it was considered that 1 A260 = 50 ng.?L-1 

DNA. Purity was evaluated after determining the values of A230 and A280 

(Sambrook et al., 1989).

~ 43 ~ 

2.2.6 rDNA amplification and sequencing 

Thermocyclic amplification of the ITS and 5.8S rRNA subunit regions of the 

fungal rDNA was carried out using ITS4 and ITS5 universal primers (White  

et al., 1990). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the 

PureTaq™ Ready-to-Go™ PCR Beads (GE Healthcare), according to the 

supplier’s instructions. For each PCR, 25 pmol of ITS4, 25 pmol of ITS5 and  

50 ng of fungal gDNA were used. Sterile high-quality water was added to each 

bead to a final volume of 25 µL. The final concentration of each dNTP was 

200 µM in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature),  

50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2. After gently flicking the tube with a finger, and 

bringing the components back to the bottom of the tube with a few seconds 

centrifugation, the beads were placed on a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf). 

PCR steps were as follows: (1) denaturation for 5 min at 95°C; (2) 25 cycles of 

annealing for 30 s at 50.4ºC, 55.1ºC or 60.1ºC, polymerization for 1 min at 

72ºC, denaturation for 30 s at 95ºC; (3) extension for 10 min at 72°C. 

DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoretic separation using horizontal 

slab gel apparatus. According to the expected length of the amplified fragments, 

an agarose concentration of 1.2% (w/v) was used. Gel was made by melting 

agarose in 0.5× TBE (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA), also used 
as running buffer. DNA samples, including molecular weight marker (1 kb DNA 

Ladder, Invitrogen), were mixed with 0.25 vol. of loading buffer [glycerol 30% 

(w/v), 0.1 M EDTA and bromophenol blue 0.25% (w/v)] and 1 ?L of 1 mg.mL-1 

EtBr. Electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V, until the bromophenol blue dye 

had reached two thirds the length of the gel. The agarose gel was visualized 

under long wave UV light (Transilluminator 2020E, Stratagene) and analyzed 

using the Eagle Eye® II Still Video System (Stratagene) through corresponding 

software (EagleSight™ 3.2, Stratagene). 

DNA fragments used for sequencing were directly purified from the PureTaq™ 

Ready-to-Go™ PCR Beads solution, after running a PCR using 60ºC as 

annealing temperature. For DNA purification, GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band 

Purification Kit (Amersham) was used. Briefly, the DNA solution was transferred 



2.4 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 44 ~ 

to a GFX Column, from which salt contaminants, primers and free nucleotides 

were washed away using a kit provided washing buffer. After applying 50 µL of 

sterile ultrapure water and incubating for 1 min, DNA was recovered by 

centrifugation for 1 min at 8000 g. 

DNA fragments were sequenced in both directions using ITS4 and ITS5 primers 

by BigDye™ Terminator Chemistry (ABI Prism®; Stabvida sequencing services).  

2.2.7 Sequence analysis 

Nucleotide editing and analysis was performed using the sequence analysis 

software from DNASTAR (Lasergene). Within the software package, EditSeq 

was used to edit sequences and multiple sequence alignments were generated 

with MegAlign, using the ClustalW algorithm (Jeanmougin et al., 1998).  

The unrooted phylogenetic tree, based on the alignment of fungal ITS 

sequences, was constructed using the DrawTree, PHYLIP software suit 

(Felsenstein, 1989). The maximum likelihood method (Doyle and Gaut, 2000) 

was used to resolve the phylogenetic relationship between the isolated fungus 

and the remaining selected species.

2.3 RESULTS 

As referred to in the Introduction (section 2.1), the Proteaceae Hakea sericea 

has proven to be invasive in some regions outside its natural range. In Portugal, 

it was first introduced as a hedge plant because of its dense and impenetrable 

cover, but became an ecological problem due to its high adaptability to climatic 

conditions and capacity to survive to frequent forest fires. Hard and woody 

follicles accumulate for years and massively open upon plant dehydration, 

either when the plant dies or is burnt. Two large winged seeds are then 

released per follicle. As a consequence, vast areas of pine and oak forests have 

been replaced by H. sericea, like those occurring in “Serra de Arga” mountain, 

northern Portugal (Fig 2.1). 

 

Figure 2.1 Hakea sericea harvesting region located in “Serra de Arga” mountain, 
northern Portugal, centred at 8º 45' 06'' W, and 41º 51' 20'' N. 

The region is shown both as a digital orthophoto (A) and as a topographic map (B). Elevation is in meters. 
The distribution of H. sericea throughout continental Portugal is also displayed in the minimap (C). 



2.3 RESULTS 

~ 46 ~ 

When scouting the “Serra de Arga” area, it was noticed that some H. sericea 

specimens presented a slight reddish colour with chlorotic leaf spots. The 

apparently diseased specimens were harvested and observed under stereo 

microscopy in the lab (Fig 2.2). Unusual black 1-3 mm circular lesions were 

observed, suggesting leaf infection by some sort of pathogenic fungus. After 

plating leaf sections containing necrotic lesions onto PDA for 20 days, eight 

fungal isolates were obtained.

Pure fungal cultures exhibited a pinkish mycelium upon 1 week of culture  

(Fig 2.3.A). Compact acervuli containing black slimy spore masses were visible 

after 4 weeks of culture (Fig 2.3.B). Microscopic observation revealed typical 

Pestalotiopsis sp. five-celled spores (three coloured median and two hyaline 

end cells) with three apical and one basal appendages (Fig 2.3.C).

The genus Pestalotiopsis is a heterogeneous group of coelomycetous fungi 

where species are defined primarily based on conidial characteristics or 

conidiogenesis (Jeewon et al., 2003). In order to further identify the 

Pestalotiopsis sp. isolated from infected H. sericea, the ITS region of the fungal 

rDNA was amplified, using ITS4 and ITS5 universal primers (White et al., 1990). 

The electrophoretic analysis of the obtained PCR products showed the 



2.3 RESULTS 

~ 48 ~ 

amplification of a 599 bp fragment, regardless the annealing temperature used 

(50.4ºC, 55.1ºC or 60.1ºC) (Fig 2.4). The fragment obtained with the highest 

stringent condition (60ºC) was selected for sequencing, since the probability of 

unspecific contaminant amplifications would be much lower. This newly 

obtained ITS sequence was then compared with orthologs from the 

Amphisphaeriaceae family, where the Pestalotiopsis genus is included. The 

multiple alignment was performed using the ClustalW method and the unrooted 

tree was plotted using the maximum-likelihood algorithm (Figs 2.5 and 2.6). 

This analysis indicated that the isolated fungus is very similar to Pestalotiopsis 

funerea (99.3% similarity). To our knowledge, this was the first report of a 

naturally occurring pathogenic fungus in portuguese H. sericea stands.

 Figure 2.6 Unrooted tree representing the phylogenetic relationship between the isolated 
Pestalotiopsis and other species of the Amphisphaeriaceae family. 

Coding sequences were analyzed using ClustalW and maximum-likelihood algorithms. The tree was 
plotted using PHYLIP’s DrawTree software. GenBank accession numbers are indicated for all entries. 

To confirm P. funerea pathogenicity, sterile seedlings of H. sericea were 

exposed to the newly isolated P. funerea spores and the symptoms were 

compared to those displayed by the naturally infected plants. After harvesting 

follicles in “Serra de Arga”, and dehydrating them at 125ºC for 1 hour, released 

seeds were disinfected with H2O2. Germination occurred in MS medium and 

seedlings were allowed to develop for 6 weeks (Fig 2.7). Leaf-wounded and 

non-wounded in vitro plants were sprayed with a suspension containing          

105 spores per mL or with sterile water. After 6 days, only leaf-wounded plants 

infected with P. funerea exhibited similar necrotic lesions and fruiting bodies as 

displayed by naturally infected plants occurring in “Serra de Arga” (Fig 2.8). 

Microscopic observation revealed typical P. funerea spores (Fig 2.8, insert).

2.4 DISCUSSION 

Vast areas of pine and oak forests are being replaced by Hakea sericea in 

northern Portugal. H. sericea spreading compromises natural regeneration of 

the main forest species, and has a profound negative impact on animal 

biodiversity. Introduced to South Africa from Australia during the 1930s as a 

hedge plant, H. sericea has become a major problem in nearly all of the coastal 

mountain ranges and catchments of the Western Cape Province (Neser and 

Fugler 1978; Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986). At the time, control of 

H. sericea involved felling the shrubs and leaving them in situ for releasing 

canopy-stored seeds. The area was then burnt once the seeds had germinated 

to kill the seedlings (Fenn, 1980; Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986). There are, 

however, several issues associated with mechanical control combined with 

controlled burning. In very dense stands fires may not spread through the 

crowns of Hakea shrubs. In opposition, the additional fuel load of dead 

H. sericea plants can result in exceptionally intense fires which may 

compromise the recovery of autochthon elements (Richardson and Manders, 

1985). Also, the follow-up time-consuming operations required to eradicate 

resultant seedlings can be hampered by the standing dead shrubs, making such 

operations prohibitively expensive. 

Biological control of H. sericea in South Africa was initiated in 1970 and 

focussed on the release of insects that reduce seed production and seedling 

development (Neser and Annecke, 1973; Gordon, 1999). The larvae of a fruit 

weevil, Erytenna consputa, from Australia, destroy the young seeds and stunt 

the development of the fruit capsule. Also from Australia, the larvae of a seed 

moth, Carposina autologa, destroy any mature seeds that have been produced. 

The shoot-boring weevil Cydmaea binotata Lea was released in 1979 to 

suppress seedling regeneration. However, in opposition to E. consputa and 

C. autologa, this insect has been mostly ineffective at the few sites where it 

became established (Kluge and Neser, 1991). Nevertheless, the interaction 



2.4 DISCUSSION 

~ 54 ~ 

between these agents and Portuguese autochthon H. sericea has never been 

studied, making them unsuitable for biological control, at least for the moment.  

Active human dispersal of spores of the virulent fungal pathogen Colletotrichum 

gloeosporioides was also tested in South Africa (Richardson and Manders, 

1985; Morris, 1991). The analysis of the symptoms progression of the disease 

over 21 months, allowed the prediction of about 82% mortality after  

10 years. Despite these promising results, the use of C. gloeosporioides as a 

biological control agent in Portugal seems unlikely, since several autochthon 

species of economic interest can also be infected by this pathogen. For 

example, in olives (Olea europaea), C. gloeosporioides can cause major yield 

losses and poor oil quality (Talhinhas et al., 2005). Several subtropical and 

temperate fruits, such as grapevine, nectarine, apple and peach can also be 

affected by C. gloeosporioides (Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Ramos et al., 2006). 

In Portugal, to our knowledge, no large scale control measures have been taken 

so far. Since mechanical or chemical control seem unfit to apply in the rough 

northern Portugal landscape, it seems imperative to find alternative biological 

agents that can be used in H. sericea control. 

Based on this assumption, apparently diseased specimens bearing necrotic 

lesions were harvested from their natural environment in “Serra de Arga” from 

which several fungal isolates were obtained. Microscopic observation revealed 

typical Pestalotiopsis spp. five-celled spores with three apical and one basal 

appendages. This result was in agreement with the detection of black 1-3 mm 

circular lesions observed on infected leaves, corresponding to the typical leaf 

spots caused by this agent (Keith et al., 2006). 

Pestalotiopsis Steyaert consists of approximately 205 described species 

broadly distributed in the world (Wang et al., 2005). Most species are plant 

pathogens, causing disease in plants such as Camellia sinensis (Wei et al., 

2007), Phoenix roebelenii (Ushida, 2004), and Proteaceae Protea and Telopea 

(Crous et al., 2000), while others are saprobes in soil and in plant debris 

(reviewed by Hu et al., 2007). Espinosa-Garcia and Langenheim (1990) first 

reported Pestalotiopsis funerea as an ecologically important endophyte from 



CHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL 

~ 55 ~ 

Sequoia sempervirens. Several Pestalotiopsis species have since been isolated 

as endophytes (reviewed by Hu et al., 2007), some of which have the ability to 

produce taxol, which had been reported to be effective against cancer (Qiu  

et al., 1994; Strobel et al., 1996).  

The identification of Pestalotiopsis is primarily based on morphologic unique 

characters, mainly by the presence of a fusiform conidia formed within compact 

acervuli. The conidia are usually five-celled, with three pigmented median cells 

and hyaline end cells (Griffiths and Swart, 1974; Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith  

et al., 2006). The pigmentation of the median cells ranging from light brown and 

dark brown to varying shades of olive green, results from the deposition of 

melanin granules within the cell matrix (Keith et al., 2006). The presence of two 

to four apical appendages arising from the apical cell and a centric basal 

appendage is also typical for Pestalotiopsis conidia. 

Although Pestalotiopsis genus is easily distinguishable with cultural and 

morphological characterization of conidia, the proper identification at the 

species level is problematic because there are few valid morphological 

characters available and they frequently overlap. For example, the 

morphological difference among P. disseminata, P. neglecta and P. uvicola is 

obscure and species designation appears to be based on personal opinions (Hu 

et al., 2007). The identification based on cultural and morphologic characters is 

even more problematic due the variation occurring between subcultures of the 

same isolate (Hu et al., 2007). When strains were cultured in the same media 

and under the same environmental conditions, conidial length, conidial width 

and length of the three median pigmented cells remained similar even after 

several subcultures. However, the length of apical and basal appendages can 

be variable, possibly being affected due to growth in the artificial media. When a 

P. funerea strain was first isolated, the average length of apical appendages 

was 12.5-22.5 ?m, being reduced to 5-15 ?m long after being subcultured twice 

(Hu et al., 2007). Since most species in this genus have few morphologic 

characters that overlap in many aspects and vary upon subculturing, the 

taxonomy of Pestalotiopsis has been equivocal and resolved differently by 

various authors (Steyeart, 1949; Guba, 1961; Sutton, 1980; Nag Rag, 1993).  



2.4 DISCUSSION 

~ 56 ~ 

Comparative studies of the nucleotide sequences of rRNA and/or ?-tubulin 

genes have been conducted as a means for analysing phylogenetic 

relationships between Pestalotiopsis and other closely related genera species 

(Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007). The molecular data 

obtained do not tend always to reveal a close relationship among species with 

similar conidia, revealing once more the complex nature of Pestalotiopsis genus 

and the difficulty in classifying it at species level (Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith et 

al., 2006). Therefore, the use of the recent molecular approaches provides a 

means to overcome the difficulties of more traditional methods. In this work, 

sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genes was used for 

identifying fungal isolates obtained from H. sericea deseased plants. The ITS 

region and intergenic spacer of the nuclear rRNA repeat units have evolved so 

fast that may vary among species within a genus or even among populations 

(White et al., 1990). The amplification and analysis of the ITS region of the 

isolated fungi indicated 99.3% similarity to the same sequence of Pestalotiopsis 

funerea. In the unrooted tree representing the phylogenetic relation between 

Pestalotiopsis species, P. maculans and P. karstenii are placed in the same 

branch as P. funerea. Accordingly, these three species share many 

morphological aspects such as the presence of three to four pigmented median 

cells, two to four apical appendages arising as tubular extensions and only one 

unbranched and central basal appendage (Jeewon et al., 2003). 

The fungal pathogenic P. funerea occurs worldwide and it has been described 

has a primary pathogen or as an opportunistic invader of conifers such as 

Cupressus arizonica (Bajo et al., 2008), Pinus radiata (Gadgil, 2005) and Taxus 

baccata (Thomas and Polwart, 2003), causing necrosis on infected tissues, and 

sometimes death of plants. To our knowledge, in this work was reported for the 

first time the infection of a Proteacea species by P. funerea.  

When the Koch’s postulates were tested by subjecting H. sericea sterile 

seedlings to the isolated P. funerea spores, it was observed that wounding prior 

to inoculation was necessary for disease development. Similar results were 

obtained with other species of Pestalotiopsis when infecting plants such as 

guava, rambutan, tea, or Miltonia orchids (Hopkins and McQuilken, 2000; 



CHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL 

~ 57 ~ 

Rivera and Wright, 2000; Keith et al., 2006). Also, plant wounding enhanced 

symptom development, as was seen for ginger and lychee. Humidity and 

temperature also seem to influence symptom development. While hot and dry 

conditions normally prevent dissemination of Pestalotiopsis (Tuset et al., 1999), 

a humid atmosphere (Kaushik et al., 1972) or unusual climatic conditions 

including heavy rainfall are favourable for disease development (Tuset et al., 

1999). Altogether, these results suggest that Pestalotiopsis behaves as an 

opportunistic pathogen that affects stressed plants. Being native from southern 

Australia, and thus more adapted to hot and dry conditions, infected specimens 

of H. sericea found in “Serra de Arga” may suffer from cold injury during winter, 

becoming more susceptible to P. funerea attack. The requirement for stress 

imposition could make P. funerea a useful biological control agent, in 

association with mechanical or chemical methods. Although a control strategy 

based on this assumption could leave non-wounded autochthon species safe 

from infection, more knowledge should be gained about P. funerea 

pathogenicity potential against other hosts. Therefore, many questions arise 

when considering its use for biological control. Firstly, would the costs of 

production and dissemination of the fungal agent be affordable? And more 

important, how would P. funerea interact with the Portuguese autochthon 

species? Taking these into account, this paper should be understood as a basis 

for further studies aiming the biological control of H. sericea using P. funerea as 

pathogenic agent.

ABSTRACT 

Up to now the higher capacity of proteoid roots to absorb inorganic phosphate 

from Pi-poor soils has been related mainly to their increased root surface area 

and higher exudation of organic acids and phosphatases, while much less 

attention has been directed to their mechanisms of Pi uptake. Here we report a 

characterization of the Pi uptake kinetics of the proteoid root-forming species 

Hakea sericea Schrad. This Proteaceae is an Australian native, which is 

disseminating very fast through forests of the European south. Dense mats of 

proteoid roots were observed in the upper soil layers of the invaded area in 

Portugal where availability of P and N was shown to be very low. Plants grown 

hydroponically under low-Pi also developed proteoid roots, and the proteoid 

clusters presented a major role in Pi absorption in comparison to the  

non-proteoid portions of the root system as revealed by their higher 32Pi 

labeling. The 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots was dependent on H+ gradient and 

yielded a biphasic kinetics, suggesting the involvement of H+/Pi co-transport 

systems with Km values of 0.225 and 40.8 µM Pi. The analogs phosphite (Phi) 

and arsenate, but not vanadate, inhibited competitively the Pi absorption. Such 

biphasic Pi uptake pattern with the highest affinity at submicromolar range is 

likely to be of critical importance for the capacity of this plant species to invade 

and proliferate throughout vast areas of nutrient-deprived soils.

3.1 INTRODUCTION 

Phosphorus (P) is an important plant macronutrient, making up about 0.2% of 

plant dry weight. P deficiency limits plant growth more frequently than any other 

nutrients except nitrogen (Schachtman et al., 1998; Vance et al., 2003; 

Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). Although total soil P content typically 

varies from 500 to 2000 mg.kg-1, total bioavailable P may be only a few mg.kg-1 

(Vance et al., 2003). The form of P most readily accessed by plants is Pi, the 

concentration of which rarely exceeds 10 mM in soil solutions (Bieleski, 1973). 

The Pi level in soil solution is regulated mainly by its interaction with organic or 

inorganic surfaces in the soil. Aluminium and iron ions in acid soils, and calcium 

ions in alkaline soils, interact strongly with Pi and render it unavailable to plants. 

Consequently, plants have developed numerous morphological, physiological, 

biochemical and molecular adaptations to acquire Pi (Vance et al., 2003; 

Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). 

Proteoid roots (or cluster roots) are considered, along with mycorrhizas and 

nitrogen-fixing nodules, to be one of the major adaptations to enhance nutrient 

acquisition (Skene, 2000). Along a proteoid root, discrete clusters of closely 

spaced rootlets develop. The rootlets emerge in continuous rows from the 

cortex and are covered with root hairs, increasing the absorption surface area 

(Watt and Evans, 1999). Species with proteoid roots can grow in soils with 

poorly available nutrients, and their induction has been reported mainly in 

response to low availability of P and Fe (Shane and Lambers, 2005). Until now 

the ability of proteoid roots in improving Pi mobilization from soil has been 

related mainly to the increase of root surface area and exudation of carboxylic 

acids, acid phosphatases, phenolics, mucilages, and water (Watt and Evans, 

1999; Neumann and Martinoia, 2002; Lambers et al., 2006). 

Hakea sericea Schrad. is a Proteaceae native in south-eastern Australia and its 

ability to produce proteoid roots, together with the production of large number of 

seeds protected by woody follicles, efficient dispersal of seeds and rapid 

germination, have enabled the species to become well-adapted to cope with 



3.1 INTRODUCTION 

~ 70 ~ 

fires and Pi-poor soils. These advantages have contributed to make H. sericea 

an aggressive invader of natural vegetation in the Mediterranean basin, similarly 

to what has been reported in New Zealand and South Africa (Dyer and 

Richardson, 1992). It has been postulated that Proteaceae species could 

present enhanced Pi absorption capacity. This feature, in association with a 

deficiency for down-regulating their Pi transport, may result in Pi toxicity 

symptoms (Shane et al., 2003; Shane et al., 2004). Nevertheless, up to now, 

detailed data on kinetics and energetics of Pi uptake by proteoid roots of Hakea 

spp. are still lacking, the only approach published so far showing transport 

depending linearly on the external Pi concentration (Roelofs et al., 2001). The 

present work reports a kinetic characterization of the Pi uptake system of the H. 

sericea proteoid roots and its relationship with the adaptive aspects of this 

invasive species in nutrient-poor soils.

3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

3.2.1 Sampling area 

Proteoid roots and follicles from wild H. sericea plants, as well as soil samples, 

were collected in “Serra de Arga” mountains (430–450 m elevation), northern 

Portugal, centred at 8º45’06” W, and 41º51’20”N. 

3.2.2 Soil analysis 

Samples were collected in 10–40 cm of depth in the soil, airdried and passed 

through a 2 mm sieve prior to analysis. Extractable P content was determined in 

the modified Egner–Riehm extract (Egner et al., 1960); Pi was measured 

colorimetrically by the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and Riley, 1962). Total P 

was extracted with aqua regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1) and measured colorimetrically. 

Mineral N content was determined in an aqueous extract of the soil (1:5) after 

reduction with FeSO4 and Ag+ followed by alkalinization. NH3 was separated by 

distillation and titrated. Total N was determined by the Kjeldhal method 

(Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982). 

3.2.3 Hydroponic culture of H. sericea 

To obtain hydroponically-grown  plants, follicles were opened at 120ºC for 1 h 

and seed dormancy was broken in the dark, at 4ºC for 1 week. Seeds were 

embedded for 24 h, and germination occurred in quartz sand. One-month 

seedlings were transferred to vessels containing 8 L mineral medium with 200 

µM Ca(NO3)2, 100 µM MgSO4, 330 µM KNO3, 50 µM NH4NO3, 18µM H3BO3,  

8 µM MnSO4, 0.16 µM CuSO4, 0.32 µM ZnSO4, 0.4 µM Na2MoO4, 20 µM 

FeEDTA, and 1, 100 or 1000 µM NaH2PO4 (depending on the experiment), at 

pH 5.8. This nutrient solution was aerated and changed biweekly. The 

hydroponic system was kept in a green-house with a photoperiod of 16 h and a 

quantum irradiance of 200 µmol m-2 s-1, at 25ºC. After 6 weeks, cotyledons were 

removed. To evaluate the effect of Pi availability on the induction of proteoid 

roots, two sets of seedlings were grown in different nutrient solutions containing 



3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 72 ~ 

1 µM or 100 µM of NaH2PO4. To study the correlation between plant P status 

and Pi uptake, plants grown in the 1 µM Pi nutrient solution were transferred to 

a 1 mM Pi nutrient solution for 2 days prior to uptake experiments. 

3.2.4 Measurement of 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots 

Radioactive phosphate (32Pi) uptake experiments were carried out according to 

a modified protocol of Sentenac and Grignon (1985). The assays were 

performed in fresh proteoid root segments (excised proteoid roots) collected 

from hydroponically-grown  H. sericea plants. After sampling, proteoid roots 

were carefully washed with deionised water and immediately used in 32Pi 

uptake experiments. In order to correlate the results obtained using roots from 

hydroponically-grown  plants with the Pi uptake phenomena occurring in plants 

growing in their natural environment, proteoid roots excised from wild-grown 

plants were also used in 32Pi uptake experiments. However, technical issues 

related with detachment of soil particles from the roots and extensive washing, 

together with the heterogeneity exhibited by the plant material, impaired 

detailed analysis of 32Pi uptake. 

In order to estimate initial 32Pi uptake rates, 50–70 mg FW of root segments 

were incubated in 20 mL of transport solution (10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MES and 

0.1–100 µM H3PO4 labeled with 32Pi), adjusted to pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 to 

impose transmembrane proton gradients, at 25ºC. 32Pi uptake was also 

measured in root segments pre-incubated with 100 µM of the protonophore 

CCCP and 100 µM TPP+ for 10 min to evaluate the dependence on proton 

electrochemical gradient. After shaking for 2 min, a period that ensures linearity 

of uptake, the reaction was stopped by washing the root segments with ice-cold 

2 mM CaCl2 under vacuum. Root segments were transferred to 50 mL Falcon 

tubes containing 5 mL of 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and incubated for 12 h. Aliquots 

of extracts (0.5–2 mL) were transferred to vials containing scintillation fluid 

(OptiPhase HiSafe II; LKB Scintillation Products). The radioactivity was 

measured in a Packard Tri-Carb 2200 CA liquid scintillation counter (Packard 

Instruments Co. Inc., Rockville, MD). Non-specific binding of labeled Pi to the 

filters and/or root cells was determined after root segments had been incubated 



CHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA 

~ 73 ~ 

with 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 12 h prior to uptake experiments and these 

results were used to correct Pi uptake data. 

3.2.5 Effect of Pi analogs and mercurial reagents on 32Pi uptake 

Inhibition of Pi transport by Phi, arsenate, or vanadate was assayed by adding 

simultaneously 2 µM 32Pi and 1 mM of these compounds. The transport reaction 

was stopped as described previously after 2 min of incubation. Competition 

between Pi and the analogs Phi and arsenate was tested by running 

competitive uptake kinetics. The transport reaction was started after the addition 

of the unlabeled substrates (250 µM). 32Pi transport was also measured in the 

presence of 100 µM HgCl2 or 250 µM mersalyl (mersalic acid), after proteoid 

roots had been pre-incubated during 10 min with the mercurial reagents. 

3.2.6 Calculation of kinetic parameters 

The data of initial Pi uptake rates were analysed by a nonlinear regression 

analysis (Graph-Pad Prism, version 4.0, Graph-Pad software, San Diego, CA, 

USA). By this method, the transport kinetics best fitting the experimental initial 

uptake rates were determined, and estimates for the kinetic parameters were 

obtained. Substrate uptake is presented as mean ± SE, and n denotes the 

number of independent experiments. 

3.2.7 Autoradiography of 32Pi labeled roots 

Root segments were incubated in 20 mL of 1 µM 32Pi transport solution and, at 

selected times, the reaction was stopped by washing the root segments with 

ice-cold 2 mM CaCl2 under vacuum, as described previously for 32Pi uptake 

experiments. Root segments were dried with paper and protected with a 

cellophane sheet. The labeling was visualized using a Bio-Rad Phosphorimager 

system (Molecular Imager® FX). 

3.2.8 Rhizosphere acidification by proteoid roots 

The exudating activity of proteoid roots was determined according to Yan et al. 

(2002). Intact roots of 10-weeks-old plants were carefully washed with 



3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 74 ~ 

deionised water, spread on an agar sheet containing 0.75% (w/v) agar, 0.006% 

(w/v) bromocresol purple, 2.5 mM K2SO4, and 1 mM CaSO4, at pH 6.0, and 

were slightly pressed into the agar avoiding any damage to the roots. 

Rhizosphere acidification was conducted under light for 5 h. Vanadate 

sensitivity of rhizosphere acidification by proteoid roots was determined by 

performing the same experiment in an agar sheet with the same composition as 

the one mentioned above, supplemented by 1 mM Na3VO4. 

3.2.9 Phosphate content determination 

Phosphate content was determined by sampling roots, stems and leaves of  

H. sericea plants grown (a) in the wild, (b) in a 1 µM Pi nutrient solution, and (c) 

in a 1 µM Pi nutrient solution followed by 2-days-incubation in a 1 mM Pi 

nutrient solution. The excised tissues were rinsed in distilled water, oven-dried 

at 70ºC, for 36 h, and ashed in a muffle furnace, at 550ºC, for 3 h. Ashed plant 

samples were digested with 10 mL of 1.4% (v/v) HNO3 solution. The digested 

samples were filtered and analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic 

emission spectrometry (ICP).

3.3 RESULTS 

3.3.1 Kinetics of Pi uptake by H. sericea proteoid roots 

Proteoid roots from wild H. sericea plants are similar to those of other Hakea 

species, showing dense clusters of rootlets covered with root hairs (Fig 3.1.A) at 

intervals along lateral secondary roots. Dense mats of proteoid roots were 

observed in upper soil layers of the sampling area, where P and N availability 

was very low, as follows: total P, 232 mg kg-1; Pi, 3.1 mg kg-1; total N, 0.07% 

(w/w); mineral N, 14 mg kg-1. When grown in hydroponics in a 1 µM Pi nutrient 

solution, plants developed an average of 20 rootlet clusters throughout the root 

system within 8–10 weeks (Fig 3.1.B). Rootlet clusters ranged from juvenile  

(8–12 days; white-coloured) to mature (14–18 days; light-brown-coloured). On 

the other hand, plants grown in a 100 µM Pi nutrient solution failed to develop 

proteoid roots. 

The contribution to the Pi uptake performed by root clusters in proteoid  

root-forming species is still a matter of controversy. The large differences in the 

morphology and density of proteoid and non-proteoid root portions of the root 

system impair an accurate comparison of transport capacities when initial 

velocities are expressed per unit of root dry or fresh weight. To circumvent this 

problem, the comparison of Pi uptake in both root types was performed directly 

by autoradiography using the root system of H. sericea plants grown 

hydroponically in a 1 µM Pi nutrient solution. As can be seen in Fig 3.2.A the 

proteoid portions of the root system displayed a high labelling intensity 

suggesting a major role on Pi uptake. As shown in Fig 3.2.B, intense 

acidification of rhizosphere was observed in the vicinity of the proteoid portions 

of H. sericea root system, most likely due to H+ pumping activity mediated by 

plasma membrane ATPase, since it was prevented by vanadate. Taking these 

results into account, all the subsequent transport experiments were performed 

in proteoid portions of the H. sericea root system.

CHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA 

~ 77 ~ 

Juvenile proteoid roots excised from H. sericea grown hydroponically in a 1 µM 

Pi nutrient solution were used for determining the time course of 1 µM 32Pi 

uptake (initial concentration), at pH 6.0 (Fig 3.3.A). 32Pi transport appeared to 

be linear as a function of time up to 6 min. A time period of incubation of 2 min 

was subsequently used to estimate the initial uptake rates of 0.1–150 µM 32Pi 

(initial concentrations) (Fig 3.3.B). The dependence of the initial velocities of Pi 

uptake on the concentration of external Pi was analysed by GraphPad Prism, 

version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using the following kinetic 

models:

where S is the substrate concentration (Pi), v the initial uptake rate, vmax the 

maximal velocity and Km is the Michaelis–Menten constant. The transport 

kinetics best fit was determined, and estimates for the parameters vmax and Km 

were obtained. The application of the computer-assisted non-linear regression 

analysis showed that experimental data displayed a better fit to the Eq. (2), 

indicating the involvement of a biphasic Pi uptake model, as suggested from the 

graphical analysis of the Eadie–Hofstee plot. Besides the low-affinity  

(Km, 40.8 µM Pi; vmax, 3.5 µmol Pi h-1 g-1 FW) Pi transport component commonly 

found in plants, another Pi transport system operating in the submicromolar 

range (Km, 225 nM Pi; vmax, 0.22 µmol Pi h-1 g-1 FW) also became apparent. 

Similar results were obtained in mature proteoid roots (not shown) suggesting 

that Pi uptake characteristics do not change significantly with the root 

development. When H. sericea plants grown hydroponically in a 1 µM Pi 

nutrient solution were transferred to a 1 mM Pi nutrient solution for 2 days, a 

biphasic kinetics was also revealed but the vmax of Pi transport in the low-affinity 

range decreased by 50% (Fig 3.3.C). Pi transport experiments were also 

performed in proteoid roots from wild-grown H. sericea. The initial velocities of 

0.2, 4 and 20 µMPi were 0.10, 1.04 and 1.97 µmol Pi h-1 g-1 FW, respectively,

hydroponically-grown  plants.

3.3.2 Effect of proton electrochemical gradient and mercuric 
reagents on Pi uptake 

Under normal physiological conditions there is a requirement for the energized 

transport of Pi across the plasma membrane from the soil to the plant because 

of the very high concentration of Pi in the cytoplasm compared with soil 

solution, and of the negative membrane potential that is characteristic of plant 

cells. Results showed that the protonophore CCCP strongly inhibited the initial 

uptake rates of 0.1–150 µM 32Pi, as shown in Table 3.1 for 2 µM 32Pi, 

suggesting the involvement of energy mediated co-transport systems driven by 

a proton gradient. Fig 3.4.A shows the effect of external pH on the initial uptake 

rates of 2 µM 32Pi by excised proteoid roots. Similar results were obtained with 

0.3 and 20 µM 32Pi (not shown). To achieve the same concentration of the 

transported form throughout the pH range 4.5–6.5, total Pi concentrations were 

adjusted according to Henderson–Hasselbach equation. Results showed that 

from pH 5.5 to 6.5 there was a reduction of about 50% on Pi transport capacity 

corroborating the involvement of H+-dependent transport. To determine which Pi 

form is preferentially transported by proteoid roots of H. sericea, uptake 

experiments depicted in Fig 3.3.B at pH 6.0 were also performed at pH 4.5, 5.5, 

and 6.5 and the new kinetic parameters evaluated. Because Km variation was 

lower when Pi concentration was expressed as [H2PO4-] through this pH range, 

the results suggest that this anionic form is the substrate for Pi transport 

systems of H. sericea, as it has been described for other plant species (Vance 

et al., 2003; Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). To evaluate the effect of 

membrane potential on Pi transport, the lipophilic and highly permeant cation 

TPP+ was used to dissipate electrical current across biological membrane. TPP+ 

inhibited Pi transport by 40% (Table 3.1), suggesting a net influx of positive 

charges into the cells, implying that more than one proton is co-transported per 

H2PO4- molecule, at 2 µM Pi and pH 6.0. In fact, the stoichiometry of Pi uptake 

is not yet resolved, but calculations and experimental data suggest that two to 

four protons are co-transported with each H2PO4- (Rausch and Bucher, 2002).

Pi transport of H. sericea was also sensitive to the inorganic mercuric 

compound HgCl2 and to mersalyl, an organomercurial that modifies cysteine 

residues (Table 3.1). Fig 3.4.B shows the dose-response effect of mersalyl on 

Pi uptake. Maximal inhibition capacity was obtained with 250 µM mersalyl, a 

reduction by 30% on initial uptake rates of 2 µM Pi being achieved. 

3.3.3 Effect of the Pi analogs phosphite, arsenic and vanadate on Pi 
uptake 

Phosphite (Phi) has been described as an analog of Pi. However, there is no 

evidence suggesting that plants can utilize Phi as a sole source of P 

(Varadarajan et al., 2002). Arsenic is a non-essential element for plants whose 

inorganic species, such as arsenate and arsenite, are generally highly 

phytotoxic (Wang et al., 2002). As shown in Table 3.1, Phi and arsenate 

inhibited 32Pi uptake in H. sericea. In addition, competition experiments showed 

that both compounds can be absorbed via Pi transporters in H. sericea proteoid 

roots. Fig 3.4.C shows the effect of 250 µM arsenate and Phi on 1–20 µM 32Pi 

uptake. Arsenate has been described as a strong competitive physiological 

analog of phosphate in higher plants (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989). Vanadate did 

not inhibit Pi transport in H. sericea (Table 3.1). However, the Pi analog

severely inhibited ATPase, probably as a result of its capacity to bind tightly to 

the phosphorylation site of ATPase (Bowman, 1983), preventing the 

acidification of rhizosphere, as shown above. Therefore, an alternative 

mechanism for vanadate uptake must exist in the plasma membrane for 

explaining the inhibition of proton pumping in H. sericea. Since Pi uptake 

experiments were performed under an artificially imposed transmembrane pH 

gradient, inhibition of proton pumping activity mediated by vanadate did not 

impair 32Pi transport. In other plant species it was also shown that phosphate 

transport is insensitive to vanadate and that other transporters are involved on 

its uptake (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989; Poder and Penot, 1992). In Lemna gibba 

vanadate uptake is mediated by a H+ co-transport mechanism and does not 

interfere with phosphate uptake (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989).

expected, given the residual amounts of Pi in the soil of the sampling area, P 

status of roots, stems and leaves of wild-grown plants were similar to those

~ 83 ~ 

found in hydroponically-grown plants in a 1 µM Pi nutrient solution. In both 

cases, roots behaved as the preferential site for P storage. In contrast, 48 h 

after the transfer of hydroponically-grown plants to a 1 mM Pi nutrient solution, 

plant P status increased dramatically. Roots capacity for P storage appears to 

have been exceeded since the concentration of P in leaves increased 

dramatically to values where toxicity symptoms started to appear (not shown). 

This increase in the leaf P status may also be due to a limitation of the 

recirculation of shoot P via phloem.

3.4 DISCUSSION 

It has been described that low-Pi status in the soil is a major cause of proteoid 

root formation (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002) that can be enhanced by N 

deficiency (Dinkelaker et al., 1995; Sas et al., 2002). Accordingly, 

hydroponically-grown H. sericea developed proteoid roots with low-P, but not in 

P-rich media. Also, P and N availability was shown to be very low in the upper 

soil layers of the sampling area where proteoid roots from wild-plants were 

collected. 

It has been difficult to demonstrate that the proteoid portion of the roots system 

is able to uptake Pi in a much higher extent than the non-proteoid portion in 

proteoid root-forming species. Roelofs et al., (2001) compared the uptake of Pi 

by proteoid and non-proteoid roots of H. prostrata by measuring the depletion of 

63, 124 and 151 µM KH2PO4 (initial concentrations) over 45 min by a 

colorimetric method. Pi transport depended linearly on the external Pi 

concentration, and uptake rates were of the same order of magnitude for both 

cluster and non-cluster roots, the latter being twice as high. Authors concluded 

that results must be interpreted with caution due, for instance, to differences in 

the morphology of both root types. Furthermore, Keerthisinghe et al., (1998) 

showed for Lupinus albus that not only the rate of Pi uptake was similar for both 

cluster and non-cluster roots but also that the results may depend on the 

method and the manner of expression of the uptake rate. Nevertheless, 

Neumann et al., (1999, 2000) reported that 33Pi uptake per unit root fresh weight 

or per root surface area in P-deficient white lupin was approximately 2-fold 

higher in root clusters compared to the apices of non-proteoid roots. In the 

present work, autoradiographs with 32Pi of root system portions demonstrated 

that the proteoid portions of the root system are the sites of a more effective Pi 

uptake in H. sericea. Although qualitative, this approach allowed the direct 

comparison of Pi uptake by both root types. In addition, the intense acidification 

observed in the vicinity of proteoid roots mediated by the plasma membrane  

H+-ATPase suggests an increased capacity to mobilize Pi from the rhizosphere 



3.4 DISCUSSION 

~ 86 ~ 

by decreasing its interaction with inorganic surfaces in the soil and to energize 

Pi transport systems. Both the increased Pi uptake and rhizosphere acidification 

around proteoid roots can result from the activity of a higher number of 

transporter proteins due to the higher surface to volume ratio of proteoid roots 

when compared to non-proteoid portions of the root system. Therefore, the 

systems responsible for Pi uptake by cluster roots may be similar to those used 

in non-cluster roots, as already described for other species (Lambers at al., 

2003), being the observed differences simply due to root morphology. 

Pi uptake capacity did not change considerably along with proteoid root 

development of hydroponically-grown H. sericea. Juvenile and mature proteoid 

roots exhibit similar Pi uptake characteristics. In contrast, it has been described 

that the exudation of compounds, such as organic acids and ectoenzymes, that 

chemically modify the surrounding soil in order to facilitate the mobilization of Pi, 

is a transient phenomenon (Watt and Evans, 1999; Neumann and Martinoia, 

2002; Lambers et al., 2003). Maintaining Pi uptake in older proteoid roots after 

the pulse of root exudation could be a pre-requisite for uptake of mobilized Pi 

and thus for the function of cluster roots and has been similarly reported for  

L. albus (Neumann et al., 1999). 

Pi uptake by proteoid roots from hydroponically-grown H. sericea was shown to 

be dependent on H+ gradient and yielded a biphasic kinetics suggesting the 

involvement of H+/Pi co-transport systems with distinct substrate affinities  

(Km 225 nM and 40.8 µM). The establishment of the transmembrane proton 

electrochemical potential is mediated by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase 

(Raghothama, 1999) whose activity can be modulated by P starvation  

(Shen et al., 2006). In several different tissues and plant species estimates of 

the Km for high-affinity uptake range from 3 to 7 µM, whereas for low-affinity 

transporters the Km estimates are more variable, from 50 to 330 µM (Clarkson, 

1984; Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; McPharlin and Bieleski, 1987; Furihata et al., 

1992). The existence of biphasic high- and low-affinity Pi transport systems has 

been shown by molecular and/or biochemical methods not only for plant cells, 

but also for bacteria (Rao and Torriani, 1990), mammals (Olah et al., 1994), 

yeast (Borst-Pauwels, 1981) and other fungi, including germ tubes of the

endomycorrhizas (Thomson et al., 1990) and intact ectomycorrhizas (Beever 

and Burns, 1980; Colpaert et al., 1999). However, for mycorrhizas, Pi affinity 

appears to span a range of Km values often quite small compared to that of  

non-mycorrhizal roots, varying from Km of 1.6 (Cress et al., 1979) to 0.01 µM 

(Straker and Mitchell, 1987). Therefore, the very high affinity Pi transport 

component found in H. sericea (Km 0.225 µM) suggests that proteoid roots can 

express a specific Pi transport system with the highest affinity characterized to 

date in non-mycorrhizal roots. This Pi transport system operating in the 

submicromolar range is likely a key element for plant survival in soils with low-Pi 

levels. 

In terms of transport capacity (vmax), Pi uptake rates in H. sericea proteoid roots 

are similar to those measured in other plant species, including the proteoid 

roots of H. prostrata (Roelofs et al., 2001) and L. albus (Keerthisinghe et al., 

1998; Neumann et al., 1999), the dauciform roots of Schoenus unispiculatus 

(Shane et al., 2005), the non-specialized roots of Zea mays (Sentenac and 

Grignon, 1985; Façanha and Okorokova-Façanha, 2002) and L. gibba  

(Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1981). However, it is difficult to compare results obtained 

from different plant species under different culture conditions using various 

experimental approaches. 

In spite of all published data, the mechanisms regulating and coordinating the 

expression and activity of plant solute transporters are far from being well 

understood. The same protein can mediate dual-affinity uptake regulated post 

transcriptionally by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, such as the case of the 

nitrate transporter CHL1, with a Km of 50 µM for the high affinity phase of uptake 

and 4 mM for the low-affinity phase (Liu et al., 1999; Liu and Tsay, 2003), or 

exhibit dual functions with spatially distinct domains for each function, such as 

the case of TRP family of ion channels that uses an N-terminal domain for its 

channel activity and a C-terminal domain for enzyme activity (Cahalan, 2001; 

Perraud et al., 2001). Also, the potassium channel gene AKT1 isolated in 

Arabidopsis was found to be responsible for high affinity potassium uptake 

(Hirsch et al., 1998) and the potassium transporter AtKUP1 also functions as a 

dual-affinity transporter (Fu and Luan, 1999). The question of the existence of 



3.4 DISCUSSION 

~ 88 ~ 

several Pi transporters with different functional characteristics in plant cell 

membranes or only one transporter with characteristics that vary with internal P 

status or external concentration has been addressed using kinetic analysis of 

uptake (Schachtman et al., 1998). However, recent advances in the molecular 

biology of putative plasma membrane and tonoplast Pi transporters confirm that 

plants have multiple transporters for Pi. In Arabidopsis thaliana, nine  

high-affinity Pi transporter genes have been identified and characterized 

(Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). At least three of these genes are 

expressed in roots and are up-regulated by Pi starvation. Similarly, in potato 

one gene was specifically induced in roots and stolons by starving the plants of 

Pi, whereas a second gene was expressed throughout the plant under 

conditions of high or low phosphate (Schachtman et al., 1998; Raghothama, 

1999). 

To study regulation of P-uptake in H. prostrate, Shane et al., (2003) cultivated 

plants with distinct P regimes and obtained an estimate of P uptake (by dividing 

total plant P by the mass of the root) as dependent on external P concentration 

(P uptake / [P]). In view of the fact that this value was about 3.5-fold higher 

when roots received 1 µM Pi than in plants with one root half immersed in a 

medium with 1 µM Pi, and the other half immersed in 75 µM Pi, the authors 

concluded that in H. prostrata Pi is able to down-regulate the P-uptake system. 

In the present work, we studied 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots of in vitro 

H. sericea plants grown under Pi deficiency and in plants subject to high Pi 

concentration for 48 h, the former exhibiting low-P status and the latter 

displaying high P concentration in roots, stems and leaves. As described for  

H. prostrata, it appears that P concentration affects Pi transport negatively. 

However, Pi uptake in the high affinity range was apparently not sensitive to 

fluctuations on both external Pi availability and P status. This is in contrast to 

the most common interpretation of the kinetic and molecular data available in 

plants suggesting that the activity of the high affinity Pi transport system is 

either increased or de-repressed by Pi starvation and the activity of the lower 

affinity transport system is constitutive (Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). In 

spite of the low-affinity Pi transport component had been reduced by 50% in  



CHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA 

~ 89 ~ 

H. sericea plants subject to high Pi, the concentration of P in plant tissues 

increased dramatically and plants started to exhibit foliar symptoms of P toxicity. 

However, since P in soil is more often in short supply than in excess, the 

invasiveness capacity of H. sericea may be enhanced by the production of 

proteoid roots displaying high efficient Pi transport, although poorly  

down-regulated by P availability. 

Both P status and Pi intake characteristics of wild-grown H. sericea plants did 

not differ too much from the values found in hydroponically-grown plants 

cultivated in a medium with low-Pi, which correlates with the residual amounts 

of P found in the sampling area. Besides the substantial mobilization of Pi within 

the activity period of typical mature proteoid roots (e.g. 10–50 µmol g-1 soil as 

reported by Dinkelaker et al., (1989), associated with the transient release of 

carboxylates, pH changes and acid phosphatases, here we have shown that  

H. sericea proteoid roots are also specialized sites for Pi uptake, a feature that 

must confer adaptive advantages to the plant to invade Pi-impoverished soils.

CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES

ABSTRACT 

In plants, different members of the phosphate transporters (PhT) family are 

responsible for the uptake, translocation through tissues and interorganellar 

allocation of phosphate (Pi). Here we report the identification of four PhT genes 

(PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) from Hakea sericea Schrad., an Australian 

Proteaceae invader of natural habitats with enhanced ability to uptake Pi. The 

phylogenetic analysis and transmembrane domain (TMD) prediction of the 

partial sequences of all identified genes place them as members of PhT1 family. 

These high- and low-affinity H+/Pi symporters, containing 12 TMDs in plasma 

membranes, are involved in Pi uptake into the cell. Phylogenetic analysis of 55 

PhTs from 13 dicot and monocot species confirms the high identity between all 

PhT1 proteins, placing PhT2 members - H+/Pi symporters expressed in the 

chloroplast - in a different cluster. Although Na+/Pi symport mechanisms have 

been almost exclusively described in bacteria, fungi and animals, we also report 

the possible existence of a 10 TMD chloroplastidial Na+/Pi symporter family in 

plants. Through phylogenetic analysis it was also demonstrated that the 

expression site of each PhT1 cannot be correlated with its deduced amino acid 

sequence and therefore be inferred based on its structural basis only. 

To better understand the Pi transport regulation mechanism of H. sericea it 

would be necessary not only to complete the sequencing of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 

and PH7, but also to study the expression patterns of these genes in plants 

under high- or low-Pi availability.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 

The phosphate transporters (PhT) belong to the major facilitator superfamily 

(MFS) that is present in all biological cells. This large and diverse family of 

proteins is involved in the transport of sugars, antibiotics, ions and amino acids 

(Pao et al., 1998; Law et al., 2008). PhT comprise different subfamilies that are 

responsible not only for the uptake of phosphate (Pi) from soil to root, but also 

for its translocation to other parts of the plant or its interorganellar allocation 

(Rausch and Bucher, 2002). The PhT1 proteins are mainly found in plasma 

membranes, suggesting an important role in Pi uptake into the cell. However, 

besides being uptaken into the cytoplasm, Pi must also be transported between 

organelles (Mimura, 1999). For example, Pi involvement in 

photophosphorylation as well as in the partitioning of triose phosphates renders 

essential its presence in the chloroplast (Versaw and Harrison, 2002). Pi import 

into the chloroplast may occur via triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator 

(TPT), in a counter-exchange of stromal triose phosphates generated from CO2 

fixation with cytosolic Pi (Walters et al., 2004). However, due to the 

stoichiometric ratio of this process, plants must rely on alternative mechanisms 

for concentrating Pi in the chloroplast. This role is played by PhT2 protein 

transporters. Although several works performed with green algae reported that 

Na+ could have a stimulatory effect on Pi uptake (Ullrich and Glaser, 1982; 

Raven, 1984), until the beginning of this decade it was widely accepted that 

Na+/Pi symporters were exclusively found in bacteria, fungi and animals (Mann 

et al., 1989; Bun-Ya et al., 1991; Martinez and Persson, 1998; Werner and 

Kinne, 2001). Reid et al. (2000) elegantly showed that the green algae Chara 

corallina also relies on a high-affinity Na+/Pi symporter for Pi uptake. In addition, 

Rubio et al. (2005) proposed the presence of a Na+/Pi symporter in Zostera 

marina, a submerged aquatic angiosperm able to uptake Pi both by leaves and 

roots (Pérez-Lloréns and Niell, 1995). According to the authors a high-affinity 

Na+/Pi coupled transport system operating in the epidermal root cells of  

Z. marina is induced upon 8 days following Pi starvation. More recently, Gao

et al. (2006) have identified a Na+/Pi transporter gene from Thellungiella 

halophila, whose protein seems to have a long N-terminal extension that 

functions as a chloroplastidial transit peptide. 

PhT1 proteins contains between 518 and 587 amino acid residues, which are 

arranged in two groups of six transmembranar domains that are connected by a 

large hydrophilic charged region containing 60 amino acids (Fig 4.1) 

(Schachtman et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000; Vance et al., 2003; Raghothama 

and Karthikeyan, 2005). The similarity between the first and the second half of 

the protein suggests that Pi transporters have evolved by a tandem intragenic 

duplication of the original structural unit of a six membrane-spanning protein 

(Pao et al., 1998; Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005).

of a PhT1 protein.  

Twelve membrane spanning regions are separated 
into two groups of six by a large hydrophilic 
charged region. 

 
The importance of Pi in so many cellular processes requires a highly regulated 

Pi uptake into the cell and interorganellar transport (Ticconi and Abel, 2004). Pi 

flux between chloroplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles and cytoplasm is primarily 

mediated by continuously expressed low-affinity PhTs (Mimura, 1999; Rausch 

and Bucher, 2002). However, the mobilization of this nutrient within plants under 

Pi deficiency mainly relies on induced high-affinity PhTs (Karthikeyan et al., 

2002; Mudge et al., 2002). Physiological studies regarding Pi uptake from soil to 

roots have suggested a dual uptake model involving both the high- and  

low-affinity systems (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; Sentenac and Grignon, 1985; 

Amijee et al., 1991). These results were corroborated by the presence of 

transcripts and proteins of both systems in root epidermal and root hair cells 

(Daram et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998; Chiou et al., 2001). 



CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES 

~ 103 ~ 

The identification and characterization of 9 high-affinity PhTs in Arabidopsis 

thaliana and 13 high- and low-affinity PhTs in Oryza sativa suggests the 

presence of a small family of high-affinity PhTs in plants (Karthikeyan et al., 

2002; Mudge et al., 2002). Many of the corresponding genes are mainly 

expressed in roots, only under low internal Pi status, reflecting the attempt of 

plants to counteract Pi deficiency. In contrast, when internal Pi status is high, 

the expression of these genes is low as well as the amount of the resultant PhT 

protein (Muchhal et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1997; Dong et al., 1999). When 

growing under Pi-deficiency, cluster roots forming species display a reduction 

on the apparent Km for Pi uptake. For example, in Lupinus albus the Km 

decreases from 30.7 ?M to 8.6 ?M, whereas uptake of Pi on a gram fresh 

weight basis is greatly increased (Keerthisinghe et al., 1998; Neumann et al., 

1999). This enhancement of Pi uptake was suggested to be related with the 

expression of a novel high-affinity Pi uptake system, LaPT1 (Liu et al., 2001). 

Hakea sericea Schrad., an Australian Proteaceae, also relies on proteoid roots 

for enhanced Pi uptake. Under low Pi availability, the Km for the high-affinity Pi 

uptake system can reach the sub-micromolar range (225 nM Pi) (Sousa et al., 

2007). However, in contrast to what has been described for A. thaliana,  

H. sericea seems unable to consistently down-regulate its high-affinity Pi uptake 

system under Pi excess. Consequently, Pi levels within stems and leaves of 

plants growing in these conditions increased more than 10-fold and phosphate 

toxicity symptoms were observed in leaves (Sousa et al., 2007; refer to  

Chapter 3). 

At present, studies regarding the characterization of PhT coding genes, not only 

for H. sericea but also for all Hakea genus, are inexistent. The aim of our work 

is to find and characterize PhT coding genes in H. sericea and correlate them 

with PhT proteins from other plant species. The expression analysis of the 

identified genes would allow to understand in detail the Pi transport regulation in 

this plant species. The expression analysis of the identified genes would allow 

the understanding the Pi transport regulation in this plant species, which is able 

to cope with nutrient-poor soils.

Hakea sericea plants were grown hydroponically in vessels containing 8 L of 

mineral medium with 200 µM Ca(NO3)2, 100 µM MgSO4, 330 µM KNO3, 50 µM

Na2MoO4, 20 µM FeEDTA, 100 µM NaH2PO4, at pH 5.8. Up to 8 plants shared 

the same 8-L container and nutrient solution was biweekly replaced. The 

hydroponic system was kept under a photoperiod of 16 h, at 25ºC, with a 

quantum irradiance of 200 µmol m-2 s-1. 

4.2.2 Genomic DNA extraction 

Genomic DNA (gDNA) purification was performed using a modification of the 

method described by Mason and Schmidt (2002). 

H. sericea leaves from 6-weeks-old plants were collected, frozen in liquid 

nitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Approximately 

2 g of fresh weigh was added to 10 mL of preheated (60ºC) extraction buffer 

[2% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (PVP-40), 0.2 M Tris  

, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 2% (v/v) ?-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0]. The mixture 

was incubated at 60ºC for 30 min, with occasional swirling. One volume of 

chloroform-isoamyl alcohol [24:1 (v/v)] was added to the solution, mixed for 

5 min and centrifuged at 7500 g for 10 min, at 10°C. For carbohydrates 

removal, 0.25 volumes of pure ethanol were added to the aqueous layer, and 

the solution was extracted twice in one volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 

[24:1 (v/v)]. Total nucleic acids were precipitated with two volumes of ethanol 

and collected without centrifugation by carefully pouring off the supernatant. 

After transferring to a 1.5 mL microtube, nucleic acids were pelleted at 14000 g 

for 10 min, at 4°C, and resuspended in 200 µL of water. Total RNA was 

digested by incubation with 50 µg RNase A, at 37°C, for 1.5 h. RNase A and 

other contaminating proteins were removed by addition of one volume of 

chloroform-isoamyl alcohol [24:1 (v/v)], mixing for 5 min, and centrifugation at

~ 105 ~ 

14000 g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was retained, and genomic DNA was 

precipitated by adding two volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium 

acetate (pH 5.2) followed by overnight incubation at 4ºC. The sample was 

centrifuged for 10 min at 14000 g and 4ºC. The pellet was briefly washed with 

70% (v/v) ethanol and air-dried for 5 min. After resuspension in 50 µL TE buffer 

[10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA], gDNA was stored at 4ºC. Quantification 

and purity evaluation of gDNA solution was determined as described in Annex I. 

4.2.3 Amplification of phosphate transporter genes by PCR 

Thermocyclic amplification of phosphate transporter genes present of H. sericea 

genome was carried out using degenerated primers (PiF1 and PiR1). PiF1 and 

PiR1 were designed based on conserved regions of plant phosphate transporter 

genes, as determined by the multiple sequence alignment of homologous 

genes. PiF1 and PiR1 design followed several parameters as suggested by 

Griffin and Griffin (1994). Both primers were 20 bases long, the G/C content 

was maintained between 45%-55%, the melting temperatures (Tm) were as 

similar as possible, and the corresponding annealing sites were separated by 

437 bp. The redundancy of the degenerated primers, referred to as the possible 

combinations of synthesized oligonucleotides sequences, was kept low (128×) 

and synthesis was performed by MWG. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 

performed using the PureTaq™ Ready-to-Go™ PCR Beads (GE Healthcare), 

according to the supplier’s instructions. For each PCR, 25 pmol of each primer 

(PiF1 and PiR1) and 50 ng of gDNA were used. The final concentration of each 

dNTP was 200 µM in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature), 50 mM KCl 

and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Sterile ultrapure water was added up to a final volume of 

25 µL. Tubes were gently flicked with a finger, and components were brought 

back to the bottom of the tube with a few seconds centrifugation. PCR 

amplification was carried out on a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf) with an 

annealing temperature gradient. PCR steps were as follows: (1) denaturation for 

5 min at 94°C; (2) 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 

1 min at 40.0ºC, 45.2ºC, 50.5ºC or 55.8ºC, polymerization for 1 min at 72°C;

(3) extension for 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were resolved by agarose 

electrophoresis as described in Annex I.  

4.2.4 Cloning of PCR fragments into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector 

DNA fragments used for cloning were recovered from agarose gels using the 

GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham). A maximum of 

300 mg of agarose gel, containing the DNA fragment of interest, were sliced in 

small pieces and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. An equal volume 

(1 mg = 1 ?L) of capture buffer was added. After vortexing vigorously, the 

mixture was incubated at 60ºC until the agarose gel was completely dissolved 

(~10 min). The sample was loaded onto a GFX column previously placed in a 

collection tube and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Following a 

centrifugation at 8000 g for 30 s, the flow-through was discarded. The GFX 

column was washed by loading 500 ?L of washing buffer, followed by a 

centrifugation at 8000 g for 30 s. DNA elution was promoted by applying 50 ?L 

of sterile ultra pure water, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 min 

and centrifugation at 8000 g for 1 min. 

DNA fragments were cloned onto the pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector 

(Stratagene), an expression vector suited to efficiently clone blunt-ended PCR 

products. As Taq DNA polymerase amplifies fragments leaving A (adenine) 

overhangs, a polishing reaction was set up using 10 ?L of the purified PCR 

product, 1 ?L of 10 mM dNTP mix (2.5 mM each), 1.3 ?L of 10× polishing buffer 

and 1 ?L of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (0.5 U) (Stratagene). The polishing 

reaction was mixed gently and incubated at 72ºC for 30 min. The ligation 

reaction was set up using 1 ?L of the pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector 

(10 ng/?L), 4 ?L of the blunt-ended PCR product, 1 ?L of PCR-Script 10× 

reaction buffer, 0.5 ?L of 10 mM ATP, 1 ?L of Srf I restriction enzyme (5 U/?L) 

(Roche), 1 ?L of T4 DNA ligase (4 U/?L) and sterile ultrapure water up to a final 

volume of 10 ?L. The ligation reaction was mixed gently and allowed to proceed 

at room temperature for 1 h before heat treating at 65°C for 10 min. An aliquot 

of the ligation reaction (2 ?L) was used to transform E. coli JM109 cells followed 

by cell plating onto selective LB-Amp plates [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone,

containing X-gal (40 ?g.mL-1) and IPTG (40 ?g.mL-1) for recombinant selection. 

4.2.5 gDNA library preparation 

H. sericea gDNA library preparation was performed according to standard 

procedures (Ausubel et al., 1996), following the instructions provided with the 

Lambda DASH® II/BamH I Vector Kit (Stratagene).  

Preparation of genomic fragments to be cloned  

Preparation of the gDNA library requires 20 kb DNA fragments. Pilot digestions 

(15 µL each) of gDNA were performed with 9 different concentrations of  

Sau3A I (Roche), ranging from 0.025 to 1x10-5 U.?g-1 of gDNA, for 1 h at 37ºC 

(refer to Annex 1). DNA fragments resulting from each reaction were analyzed 

by electrophoretic separation [0.5% (w/v) agarose, refer to Annex 1]. After 

determining the Sau3A I concentration at which 20 kb DNA fragments were 

predominantly obtained, 5 large scale digestions (500 µL each) were carried out 

using the optimized conditions and 100 ?g of gDNA each. Digested DNA 

fragments were extracted twice in one volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 

[24:1 (v/v)] and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol at -20ºC during 

overnight. After centrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min at 4°C, DNA was 

resuspended in 200 µL of water. DNA fragments were subsequently fractioned 

by centrifugation in continuous sucrose gradient. Sucrose gradient was 

produced in 30 mL tubes with a gradient generator, using 10% (w/v) and 

40% (w/v) sucrose solutions prepared in gradient buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl 

(pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl and 5 mM EDTA]. After being incubated at 65ºC for 5 min, 

DNA samples were applied to the top of the gradient and centrifuged at 12000 g 

for 20 h at 4ºC. The gradient was fractionated in 1 mL samples, collected from 

the bottom. After electrophoretic analysis [0.5% (w/v) agarose, refer to 

Annex 1], fractions containing 20 kb DNA fragments were precipitated with two 

volumes of ethanol at -20ºC, during overnight. DNA was recovered by 

centrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in 100 µL of 



4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 108 ~ 

ultrapure water. Quantification and purity evaluation of DNA solution was 

determined as described in Annex I. 

Cloning of genomic fragments and library packaging  

The ligation of inserts to Lambda DASH® II vector (Stratagene) was performed 

using 0.4 ?g of H. sericea gDNA fragments, 1 ?g of lambda vector, 0.5 ?L of 

10× ligase buffer [500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT], 

0.5 ?L of 10 mM ATP and 2 U of T4 DNA ligase (Roche) up to a final volume of 

5 ?L. The mixture was incubated at 4ºC, during overnight. 

The lambda packaging extracts (Gigapack® III Packaging Extract, Stratagene) 

were removed from -80ºC and quickly thawed. The volume of ligation reaction 

mixture, corresponding to 1.0 ?g of DNA, was immediately added to the 

packaging extract and gently mixed. The packaging mixture was then incubated 

at 22ºC for 2 h, followed by addition of 500 ?L of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl 

(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine] and 20 ?L 

of chloroform. The suspension was mixed and briefly centrifuged to sediment 

debris. 

Titering the genomic library 

A single colony of E. coli XL1-Blue MRF’ strain (Jerpseth et al., 1992) was used 

to inoculate 500 mL of LB [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 

1% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.0], supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4 and 0.2% (w/v) 

maltose. Growth was promoted by incubation at 30ºC with shaking (200 rpm), 

during overnight. The bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 g for 

10 min, and resuspended in half the original volume with sterile 10 mM MgSO4. 

Cells were further diluted to an A600 = 0.5 with sterile 10 mM MgSO4. 

For titering the phage solution, 10-fold dilutions (10-1 to 10-3) of the packaged 

reaction were prepared in SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 

10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine], and 1 ?L of each dilution was 

added to 200 ?L of XL1-Blue MRF’ host cells. After incubation at 37°C for 

15 min, 3 mL of melted Top Agarose NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 

1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) 



CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES 

~ 109 ~ 

MgSO4.7H2O, 0.7% (w/v) agarose, pH 7.5] were added to the phage-cell 

suspension. After mixing, the suspension was quickly poured onto the NZY agar 

plates [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 

0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, 1.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.5] and 

incubated at 37°C for 6 h. The titer was determined by counting the number of 

phage plaques. 

Amplification of the genomic library 

The gDNA library was amplified by separately combine 20 aliquots of the 

packaged library suspension, each containing 5x104 pfu, with 600 ?L of   

XL1-Blue MRF’ cells prepared as previously described. After incubation at 37ºC 

for 15 min, 6.5 mL of melted Top Agarose NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast 

extract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) 

MgSO4.7H2O, 0.7% (w/v) agarose, pH 7.5] were added. The mixture was 

quickly poured onto the NZY agar medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) 

NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, 

1.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.5] (150-mm plates) and incubated at 37°C for 6 h. Plates 

were overlaid with 8 mL of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 

10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine]. For promoting the diffusion of 

phage into the SM buffer, an overnight incubation with gentle agitation was 

performed at 4ºC. The bacteriophage suspension recovered from all the plates 

was pooled together and chloroform to a 5% (v/v) final concentration was 

added. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 g. After 

recovering the supernatant, chloroform was added to a 0.3% (v/v) final 

concentration and the suspension was stored at 4ºC. Long term storage was 

made at -80ºC using aliquots of the amplified library in 7% (v/v) DMSO. Before 

using the genomic library, the titer was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions 

and XL1-Blue MRF’ host cells, as previously described. 



4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

~ 110 ~ 

4.2.6 gDNA library screening 

Amplified H. sericea DNA fragments coding for phosphate transporters (section 

4.2.3) were used as homologous probes for the screening of H. sericea gDNA 

library.  

The gDNA library was plated onto 150-mm NZY agar plates, as described in 

section 4.2.5 (Amplification of genomic library), but using a density of 25000 

plaques per plate. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 12 h, followed 

by further incubation at 4ºC for 2 h. Phage particles were transferred from 

plaques to duplicate nylon filter discs (Hybond-N+; Amersham). The first disc 

was placed onto each NZY agar plate for 2 min, while the replica disc was 

placed for 4 min, to allow the transfer of phage particles to the membrane. 

Release of DNA from the phage particle was promoted by incubating the 

membrane in denaturation solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH) for 2 min. Plaque 

lifts were then transferred to the neutralization solution [0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 

1.5 M NaCl] for 5 min, rinsed in washing solution [0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 

30 mM Na citrate (pH 7.0); 0.3 M NaCl] for 30 seconds and air dried on 

Whatman® 3MM paper. DNA was crosslinked to the membranes by UV light in 

a Stratalinker® UV crosslinker (Model 1800, Stratagene) using the autocrosslink 

setting (1200 mJ). The hybridization proceeded as described in Annex 1. 

The phage plaques responsible for coincident positive signals in both lifts were 

removed from the NZY agar plate and resuspended in 500 ?L of SM buffer 

[50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) 

gelatine] containing 20 ?L of chloroform. After vortexing, lambda phages were 

re-plated at low density in NZY agar medium, using the same conditions as 

previously referred (section 4.2.5, Titering the genomic library), but incubating 

the plates at 37°C for 12 h, followed by further incubation at 4ºC for 2 h. For the 

second screening, Hybond-N (Amersham) nylon filter discs were used, but no 

duplicates were performed. Positive individualized clones were recovered from 

the agar plates, resuspended in 500 ?L of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 

100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine] containing 20 ?L of 

chloroform and vortexed.

4.2.7 DNA recovery from lambda phages 

DNA recovery from lambda phages was performed using the Lambda Kit 

(Qiagen). Briefly, 250 ?L of the isolated single-clone lambda phage suspension 

(section 4.2.6) were combined with 200 ?L of XL1-Blue MRF’ cells, prepared as 

referred in section 4.2.5 (Titering the genomic library), and incubated at 37°C for 

15 min. After incubation at 37°C for 15 min, 3 mL of NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) 

yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% 

(w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, pH 7.5] were added and the suspension was incubated at 

37ºC, during overnight, with agitation. Following the addition of 2% (v/v) 

chloroform, the incubation at 37°C was allowed to proceed for further 15 min to 

enhance lysis efficiency. The phage suspension was centrifuged at 12000 g for 

10 min to remove bacterial debris. After adding 10 µL of Buffer L1 [300 mM 

NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 0.2 mg.mL-1 BSA, 20 mg.mL-1 

RNase A, 6 mg.mL-1 DNase I] to 3 mL of the supernatant, an incubation at 37ºC 

for 30 min was performed for bacterial DNA and RNA removal. Following the 

addition of 700 µL of ice-cold buffer L2 [30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 

(PEG 6000), 3 M NaCl], the solution was incubated on ice for 60 min to promote 

phage precipitation. After centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min, the pellet was 

resuspended in 1 mL of buffer L3 [100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 

25 mM EDTA]. 

To allow denaturation of phage proteins and release of DNA, phage suspension 

was gently mixed with 1 mL of buffer L4 [4% (w/v) SDS] and incubated at 70ºC 

for 10 min. The DNA solution was recovered after centrifugation at 15000 g for 

10 min, at 4ºC. A Qiagen-tip column was equilibrated by applying 1 mL of Buffer 

QBT [750 mM NaCl, 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 15% (v/v) isopropanol, 

0.15% (w/v) Triton X-100], using the gravity flow. After applying the DNA 

solution, the column was washed with 2 mL of Buffer QC [1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM 

MOPS (pH 7.0), 15% (v/v) isopropanol]. DNA was eluted with 1.5 mL of Buffer 

QF [1.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)] and precipitated by adding 1 mL of 

isopropanol. The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 15000 g for 30 min at 

4°C. The precipitated DNA was washed with 1 mL 70% (v/v) ethanol, air-dried

and dissolved in 50 µL of ultrapure water. Quantification and purity evaluation of 

gDNA solution was determined as described in Annex I. 

4.2.8 Sequence search and analysis 

DNA fragments were sequenced by BigDye™ Terminator Chemistry (ABI 

Prism®; Stabvida sequencing services). Database search for nucleotide and 

protein sequences was performed at the NCBI website using Entrez 

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/index.html). The database search for highly 

similar sequences was carried out using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., 

1997; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Nucleotide editing and analysis was 

performed using the sequence analysis software from DNASTAR (Lasergene). 

Within the software package, EditSeq was used to edit sequences and multiple 

sequence alignments were generated with MegAlign, using the ClustalW 

algorithm (Jeanmougin et al., 1998). The unrooted phylogenetic tree, based on 

the alignment of plant Pi transporter genes, was constructed using FigTree 

1.2.2 (freeware). The maximum likelihood method (Doyle and Gaut, 2000) was 

used to resolve the phylogenetic relationship between the newly identified  

H. sericea Pi transporter genes and those from other plant species. 

The analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Pi transporter genes expression was 

performed using eFP Browser (Winter et al., 2007; http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-

bin/efpWeb.cgi). 

Prediction of transmembrane domains was carried out using the TMHMM 

server version 2.0 (Sonnhammer et al., 1998; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ 

TMHMM). All predictions were performed using standard settings.

4.3 RESULTS 

4.3.1 Search for genes encoding PhTs in Hakea sericea genome 

In order to identify genes encoding PhTs in H. sericea, two different approaches 

were attempted. Using H. sericea genomic DNA as template, DNA fragments 

from H. sericea PhT genes were amplified using degenerated primers. The 

amplified fragments were subsequently used as probes for screening other PhT 

genes in a gDNA library of H. sericea. 

The amplification of PhT gene fragments in H. sericea genome was carried out 

using degenerated primers (PiF1 and PiR1). For their design, the conserved 

regions of higher plant H+/Pi symporters encoding genes were used, as 

determined by the multiple sequence alignment of homologous genes (Fig 4.2) 

The electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products showed the amplification 

of fragments with the expected molecular weight of 437 bp in all tested 

annealing temperatures (Fig 4.3.A). When performing the amplification using 

the annealing temperature of 40ºC, besides the 437 bp fragments, other 

unspecific amplified products with different molecular weights were observed. 

However, subsequent Southern blot analysis using as [?-32P]dCTP labeled 

probe a LaPT1 gene fragment from Lupinus albus showed that only the 437 bp 

fragments hybridized with LaPT1 (Fig 4.3.B). Therefore, these fragments will be 

further referred to as PiT fragments. 

After being purified from the gel, the PiT fragments from the PCR amplification 

using 55°C as annealing temperature were cloned into the pPCR-Script Amp 

SK(+) vector. Since fragments from different PhT genes could have been 

simultaneously amplified, six recombinant plasmids were isolated, purified and 

digested with EcoRI/SacI. The restriction fragments were analyzed by 

electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis (Fig 4.4). Two different restriction 

patterns were detected, indicating the amplification of fragments from at least 

two different PhT genes during PCR [(PiT2, PiT4 and PiT5) and (PiT1, PiT3 and 

PiT6)]. PiT2 and PiT6 fragments were then completely sequenced (Fig 4.5).

(Fig 4.7). Fifteen lambda clones from different intensity spots were isolated, 

purified and digested with EcoRI, and the corresponding restriction patterns 

were obtained by electrophoresis (Fig 4.8). All the analysed clones presented a 

different restriction pattern, suggesting that all of them were independent clones 

from H. sericea genomic library. Therefore, the recombinant DNA from all the

4.3.2 PhTs in plants: phylogenetic analysis and domain prediction 

The phylogenetic analysis of 55 PhTs found in mono- and dicotyledons was 

performed. The multiple alignment of aminoacidic sequences was performed 

using the ClustalW method and an unrooted tree was plotted using the 

maximum-likelihood algorithm (Fig 4.10). Analysed proteins belong to three 

distinct subfamilies of Pi transporters: PhT1, which includes high- and low-

affinity H+/Pi symporters presumed to be targeted to the plasma membrane; 

PhT2, a family of low-affinity H+/Pi symporters expressed in chloroplasts; and a 

hypothetical Na+/Pi symporters family. Moreover, the PhT1 family was further 

subdivided in two major clusters, comprising monocot or dicot proteins. The 

organ in which PhT proteins are mainly expressed is also represented in the 

phylogenetic tree (Fig 4.10). 

The phylogenetic relations between PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 were also 

analysed (Fig 4.11). As their incomplete deduced aminoacid sequences 

impaired direct comparison with PhTs from other species, the 55 PhT 

sequences were trimmed before alignment to include only the same region as 

H. sericea sequences. As in Fig 4.10, results primarily showed an out-group 

composed by PhT2 members. The hypothetical Na+/Pi symporters also 

clustered together, but shared their branch with some PhT1 members. 

Regarding H. sericea PhTs, PiT2 clustered with a Pi transporter expressed 

mainly in flowers and pollen of Arabidopsis thaliana (At5G43340). PiT6 was 

included in the cluster in which the Na+/Pi symporters were included, together 

with other dicot PhT1 members: two A. thaliana proteins (At1G20860 and 

At1G76430) and a PhT1 member expressed in the roots of Medicago truncatula 

(MtPT1;4). Finally, PH5 and PH7 clustered together with PhT1 members from 

the dicots A. thaliana, M. truncatula and L. albus, which are mostly expressed in 

roots (At5G43350, At5G43360, At5G43370 and LaPT1;2), senescent leaves 

(At2G32830) or in a location yet to study (MtPT1;6). Also included in this cluster 

is the PhT1 proteins from the monocot Oryza sativa (OsPT1;4 and OsPT1;5), 

for which the expression site is currently unknown.

The transmembrane domains (TMD) of representatives from the three analysed 

PhT subfamilies were predicted with the TMHMM v2 algorithm (Fig 4.12). PhT2 

members presented typical 12 membrane spanning domains, separated by a 

hydrophilic loop between TMD8 and TMD9 (Fig 4.12.A). It also presents a long 

extracellular hydrophilic N terminus. For the hypothetical Na+/Pi symporters, 

TMHMM v2 algorithm predicted 10 membrane spanning domains and a long 

hydrophilic N terminus (Fig 4.12.B). PhT1 members, regardless of their main 

expression site, typically present 12 membrane spanning domains as PhT2 

proteins, but being divided into two groups of 6 each (Fig 4.12.C). Both groups 

are connected by a large hydrophilic charged region, between TMD6 and 

TMD7, containing 60 amino acids. For the incomplete deduced aminoacid 

sequences of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7, the TMHMM v2 algorithm predicted 

three transmembrane domains that overlap TMD2, TMD3 and TMD4 from PhT1 

(Fig 4.12.D).

4.4 DISCUSSION

4.4 DISCUSSION 

Phosphate is one of the most important macronutrients for plant growth and 

development. It is generally acquired by epidermal cells at the root-soil interface 

and distributed to the aerial parts of the plant through its secretion into the 

xylem sap. During Pi shortage or senescence, this nutrient can eventually be 

cycled through the plant via the phloem (Daram, 1999; Mimura, 1999; 

Raghothama, 1999). It is commonly accepted that both processes occur at the 

plasma membrane through the activity of high- and low-affinity H+/Pi symporters 

from the PhT1 subfamily (Lefebvre and Clarkson, 1984; Ullrich-Eberius et al., 

1984; Mimura, 1999; Rausch and Bucher, 2002). The computational modelling 

of PhT1 proteins secondary structure predicted a six-loop-six structure, 

containing 12 TMDs with a large hydrophilic loop between TMD6 and TMD7.  

Also PhT2 transporters contain 12 TMDs, but in opposition to PhT1 members, 

these Pi transporters present a large hydrophilic loop between TMD8 and TMD9 

and a long N-terminal extension that functions as a transit peptide, directing the 

protein to the chloroplast (Walters et al., 2004). The hypothetical Na+/Pi 

transporters have 10 TMDs and a long N-terminal chloroplastidial transit peptide 

(Gao et al., 2006). 

The phylogenetic analysis of 55 PhTs distributed across 13 plant species 

showed that all analyzed PhT1 members are included in the same cluster, 

forming two subgroups composed by either dicot or monocot proteins. The high 

similarity of PhT1 proteins with each other as well as with the yeast PHO84 

phosphate transporter (Saccharomyces cereviseae) and the fungi GvPT 

phosphate transporter (Glomus versiforme) (Bun-Ya et al., 1991; Harrison and 

van Buuren, 1995; Leggewie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997) suggests that H+/Pi 

symport is a highly conserved and widespread mechanism in plants and fungi. 

Taking into account that PhT1 and other individual MFS families diverged from 

each other long before eukarya and archaea diverged from bacteria, it is 

expected that members of this subfamily should be present in other taxa 

besides those from plants or fungi (Pao et al., 1998). In what concerns the PhT2 



CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES

members, all have clustered together and do not share homology with the PhT1 

family. In fact, plant PhT2 members share more identity with Pi transporters 

from bacteria, Caenorhabditis elegans and the Na+/Pi symporters from both 

mammals and fungi than with plant PhT1 members (Mann et al., 1989; Martinez 

and Persson, 1998; Rausch and Bucher, 2002). Still, functional analysis 

indicates that PhT2 are low-affinity H+/Pi symporters (Daram et al., 1999; 

Rausch and Bucher, 2002). The phylogenetic analysis also suggests the 

existence of a new chloroplastidial Na+/Pi transporter family with orthologs in 

both dicot (A. thaliana) and monocot (Oryza sativa). The identification of this 

new putative PhT family suggests that plants also rely on Na+/Pi transporters. 

This transport mechanism could be particularly useful in halophytes or in plants 

living in alkaline media, where high Na+ concentrations could be used for 

energization of anion transport (Rausch and Bucher, 2002). 

In this work, four Hakea sericea PhT genes (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) were 

identified and partially sequenced. The genomic amplification of H. sericea 

gDNA, using degenerated primers based on the conserved regions of PhT1 

sequences from other plant species, resulted in the identification of PiT2 and 

PiT6 gene sequences. The subsequent screening of the H. sericea gDNA 

library, using PiT2 and PiT6 gene fragments as probes, resulted in the 

additional identification of PH5 and PH7 genes. According to the protein 

sequence alignment of higher plant H+/Pi symporters, the partial deduced 

aminoacid sequences of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 correspond only to the 

transmembranar domains TMD2, TMD3 and TMD4 of PhT1 proteins.  

The sequences of 55 higher plant H+/Pi symporters were used for performing 

the phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified H. sericea genes. For 

performing this, all PhT proteins were trimmed before alignment to include only 

the coding region of TMD2, TMD3 and TMD4 (TMD2-4). In this analysis, PhT1 

from either dicot or monocot do not cluster in separate groups, contrasting with 

the results previously obtained when considering all the PhT amino acid 

sequences. Moreover, PhT1s (TMD2-4) by themselves do not cluster together 

alone, as PhT1 complete proteins do, since the hypothetical Na+/Pi symporter 

family is included in their cluster. These results suggest that TMD2-4 region is

highly conserved amongst PhTs from different subfamilies and plant species 

and alone do not represent the evolutionary pathway of H+/Pi symporters. To 

perform a complete phylogenetic study, other regions of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and 

PH7 proteins must be sequenced and analysed. 

The first expression studies of PhT genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (Muchhal  

et al., 1996), Solanum tuberosum (Leggewie et al., 1997) and Lycopersicon 

esculentum (Daram et al., 1998) showed high-affinity PhT1 members being 

expressed mainly in root organs of Pi deficient plants. In contrast, low-affinity 

PhT members were ubiquitously expressed throughout the whole plant. These 

findings led to the assumption that high-affinity PhT members should be 

involved in Pi uptake from soil, whereas the translocation of Pi throughout the 

plant was carried by low-affinity transporters (Daram et al., 1999). Subsequent 

studies have shown that under Pi deficiency, high-affinity PhT1 members are 

also expressed in other plant parts besides roots (Karthikeyan et al., 2002; 

Mudge et al., 2002). We have attempted to find a possible relation between the 

amino acid sequence of PhT1 members and their main expression site. 

However, the preferential expression site of any given PhT1 is not directly 

related to its deduced amino acid sequence and cannot be inferred only based 

on its structure. For example, both LaPT1;1 and LaPT1;2 are expressed in roots 

of L. albus (Liu et al., 2001) but seem fairly unrelated. In contrast, At1G20860 

and At5G43340 are structurally alike but are expressed in different A. thaliana 

plant organs.  

The expression studies on similar PhTs that group together into small clusters 

(e.g. At5G43350, At5G43350 and At5G43350 or MtPT1;1, MtPT1;2 and 

MtPT1;3) show that even structurally similar proteins may have different 

physiological roles. In Medicago truncatula, MtPT1;1 and MtPT1;2 are almost 

identical, sharing 91.6% and 98% sequence identity at the nucleotide and 

amino acid levels, respectively. However, the expression of MtPT1;1 and 

MtPT1;2 genes, evaluated by Northern blot analysis, revealed differences in 

their expression patterns (Liu et al., 1998b). Although both genes are only 

expressed in roots, MtPT1;1 is much less responsive to Pi fluctuations than 

MtPT1;2, which is only induced in Pi deficiency and repressed in Pi sufficiency. 



CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES 

~ 127 ~ 

In S. tuberosum, StPT1;1 and StPT1;3 share 83,9% amino acid sequence 

identity. Although StPT1;1 seems to encode a low-affinity PhT involved in Pi 

translocation within the plant and is expressed in different plant parts, StPT1;3 

encodes a high-affinity PhT whose expression is strongly induced in roots due 

to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonisation (Leggewie et al., 1997; Rausch et 

al., 2001). Both studies, on M. truncatula and S. tuberosum, suggest that small 

differences in the protein amino acid sequence are sufficient to completely alter 

the kinetic parameters of the PhT proteins. 

In order to understand the regulation mechanisms of Pi transport in H. sericea, 

the expression patterns and tissue specifity of the four PhT genes in plants 

grown under either high- or low-Pi availability should be analized.

Spectrophotometric quantification of DNA 

Quantification of DNA was performed by spectrophotometry on a Cary 1E UV-

Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian). The A260 of diluted sample solution was 

determined and DNA concentration was estimated taking into account that 

1 A260 = 50 ng/?L DNA. Purity was evaluated after determining the values of 

A230 and A280 (Sambrook et al., 1989). 

Nucleic acid electrophoretic separation 

DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis using a horizontal slab gel 

apparatus. Gel was made by melting agarose in 0.5× TBE (45 mM Tris; 45 mM 

boric acid; 1 mM EDTA), also used as running buffer. DNA samples, including 
molecular weight marker (1 kb DNA Ladder, Invitrogen), were mixed with 

0.25 vol of loading buffer [glycerol 30% (w/v); 0.1 M EDTA and bromophenol 

blue 0.25% (w/v)] and 1 ?L of 1 mg.mL-1 EtBr. Electrophoresis was carried out 

at 80 V, until the bromophenol blue dye had reached two thirds of the gel 

length. The agarose gel was visualized under long wave UV light 

(Transilluminator 2020E, Stratagene) and analyzed using the Eagle Eye® II Still 

Video System (Stratagene) through corresponding software (EagleSight™ 3.2, 

Stratagene). 

Southern blotting 

Transfer of DNA from agarose gels to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, 

Amersham) was performed by the capillary transfer method (Ausubel et al. 

1996). After electrophoresis, DNA denaturation was promoted by rinsing the 

agarose gel in 0.4 M NaOH for 20 min. A transfer apparatus was set up by 

placing a platform inside a reservoir that contained transfer solution (0.4 M 

NaOH). Three sheets of Whatman® 3MM paper soaked in transfer solution were 

laid on the platform and their ends were immersed into the transfer solution. 



CHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES 

~ 133 ~ 

The agarose gel was placed above the soaked paper. On top of the agarose gel 

and cut to gel size were successively layered: (1) the nylon membrane; (2) 

three sheets of soaked Whatman® 3MM paper; (3) a 7 cm stack of paper 

towels. Finally, a glass plate and a small weight (0.6-1 kg) were placed on top to 

promote capillary transfer of reservoir liquid to the absorbing paper towels. 

Capillary transfer was allowed to proceed overnight. Nucleic acids were 

crosslinked to the membranes with UV light (120 mJ) on the Stratalinker® UV 

crosslinker (Model 1800, Stratagene). 

Hybridization with 32P-labelled DNA probes 

DNA fragments were 32P-labeled by random oligonucleotide priming using the 

Rediprime II DNA labelling system (Amersham) and [?-32P] dCTP (Redivue, 

Amersham). Briefly, each DNA probe (100-200 ng) was diluted to a final volume 

of 45 ?L in TE buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 1 mM EDTA], denaturated at 

95°C for 5 min, and cooled on ice for 5 min. The solution was used to 

reconstitute the Rediprime II labelling mix, after which 5 ?L of [?-32P] dCTP 

(50 ?Ci) were added. Radioactive nucleotide incorporation was promoted by 

incubating the reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 h.  

Radiolabelled probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by gel 

filtration through a Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia) (Sambrook et al., 1989). A 

sterile Pasteur pipette was partially blocked with a glass pearl and filled with 

Sephadex G-50 resin equilibrated in TE buffer. The column was washed with 

3 mL of TE and the radiolabelled probe loaded. Size separation by gravity flow 

was promoted by loading into the column one 450 ?L TEN fraction [100 mM 

NaCl in TE buffer] followed by twelve 150 ?L TEN fractions. All fractions were 

separately collected in microtubes and evaluated for radioactivity with a mini-

monitor (Series 900, Morgan). The first 4-5 fractions to present radioactivity 

were pooled. 

Membrane filters were pre-hybridized in hybridization buffer [50 mM sodium 

phosphate (pH 7.0); 0.9 M NaCl; 5 mM EDTA; 10× Denhardt reagent [5% (w/v) 

Ficoll 400; 5% (w/v) PVP 360; 5% (w/v) BSA (fraction V)]; 0.1% SDS, 

250 ?g.mL-1 denatured salmon sperm DNA and 30% (v/v) formamide] at 42°C, 



ANNEX I. GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS 

~ 134 ~ 

for 3 h, in a hybridization oven (Amersham). The radiolabelled probe was heat 

denatured for 5 min, cooled on ice and added to the hybridization buffer. 

Hybridization was allowed to proceed overnight at 42ºC, with shaking. After 

hybridization, filters were successively washed for 20 min in the following 

solutions: (1) 2× SSC [30 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0); 0.3 M NaCl], 0.1% SDS, 

at 45°C; (2) 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 50°C; (3) 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 50°C. The 

final washing step was 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 55°C. 

Autoradiography 

Radioactive membrane filters were wrapped in plastic film and placed into 

hybridization cassetes (Hypercassete, Amersham) containing two intensifying 

screens (Hyperscreen, Amersham). An autoradiographic film (BioMax MS, 

Kodak) was put in contact with the membrane and exposure was performed at  

–80°C for the appropriated period (overnight to 1 week). The autoradiographic 

film was developed in a darkroom by its submersion in X-ray Developer D-19 

(Kodak) for up to 5 min. Development was stopped by rinsing the film in 3% 

(v/v) acetic acid stop solution and fixation was performed by submerging the 

film in Rapid Fixer (Ilford) for 5 min. After rinsing with running water for 5 min, 

the film was dried at room temperature. 

Transformation of E. coli cells 

Preparation and transformation of E. coli competent cells was performed using 

the method described by Inoue et al. (1990). 

Competent cells were prepared by inoculating 250 mL of SOB medium 

[2% (w/v) bacto-tryptone; 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract; 2.5 mM KCl; 10 mM NaCl; 

10 mM MgSO4; 10 mM MgCl2] with a single colony of E. coli JM109 (Yanish-

Perron et al., 1985). Cells were grown at 18°C with vigorous shaking (200-

250 rpm) until A600 = 0.6. The culture was placed on ice for 10 min and cells 

were collected by centrifugation at 2500 g for 10 min at 4ºC. The pellet was 

resuspended in 80 mL of ice-cold TB buffer (10 mM PIPES; 15 mM CaCl2; 

250 mM KCl; 55 mM MnCl2), and left on ice for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged 

at 2500 g for 10 min at 4ºC, and gently resuspended in 20 mL of ice-cold TB

buffer. DMSO was carefully added to a final concentration of 7% (v/v). The cell 

suspension was left on ice for 10 minutes and distributed in 200 ?L aliquots, 

which were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  

Transformation of E. coli cells was initiated by thawing competent cells on ice. 

The DNA sample (1-20 ?L) was added to 200 ?L of competent cells by gentle 

mixing, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were heat-

shocked by incubation at 42°C for 30 s with agitation, followed by 10 min on ice. 

After addition of 0.8 mL of SOC medium [2% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) 

yeast extract, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM 

glucose], an incubation for 1 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking (200-250 rpm) 

was performed. Cells were spun down for a 30 s at 10000 g and the pellet 

resuspended in 50 ?L of the supernatant. Finally, cells were transferred to LB 

selective plates [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) 

NaCl, pH 7.0], containing X-gal (40 ?g.mL-1) and IPTG (40 ?g.mL-1), and 

incubated overnight at 37°C. 

Plasmid isolation 

The purification of small amounts of DNA to be used in restriction fragment 

analysis was performed by the boiling method (Holmes and Quigley, 1981). 

Bacteria were grown overnight in the appropriate liquid culture media. An 

aliquot of 1.5 mL of the culture was collected and centrifuged at 8000 g for 

5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 400 ?L of STET [10 mM Tris-HCl 

(pH 8.0); 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 5% (v/v) Triton X-100], supplemented 

with 25 ?L of freshly prepared lysozyme solution [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 

10 mg.mL-1 lysozyme]. Lysis was promoted by incubation at room temperature 

for 10 min, followed by incubation at 95ºC for 1 min. Denaturated proteins and 

chromosomal DNA were removed by centrifugation at 14000 g for 15 min. The 

supernatant was recovered and mixed with 300 ?L of isopropanol to precipitate 

plasmid DNA. After centrifugation under the same conditions, the supernatant 

was discarded and the plasmid was resuspended in 20-100 ?L of TE [10 mM 

Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 1 mM EDTA]. 



ANNEX I. GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS 

~ 136 ~ 

Medium scale isolation of high purity plasmid DNA to be used for sequencing 

and probe isolation was performed using the Wizard™ Plus Midipreps DNA 

Purification System (Promega), according to the supplier’s instructions. Briefly, 

bacteria were grown overnight in the appropriate liquid culture media (100 mL). 

The culture was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 

3 mL of resuspension buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 10 mM EDTA; 

100 ?g.mL-1 of RNase A] and an equal volume of lysis buffer [200 mM NaOH, 

1% (w/v) SDS] was added. The mixture was gentle mixed by swirling until 

clearing. The lysate was neutralized by the addition of 3 mL of neutralization 

buffer [1.32 M KOAc (pH 4.8)], followed by gentle mixing. Cell debris was 

removed by centrifugation at 14000 g for 15 min at 4ºC. The supernatant was 

combined with 10 mL of the Wizard® Midiprep DNA Purification Resin 

(Promega) and loaded onto the midicolumn. Vacuum was applied to the column 

to promote packaging of the resin and 2x15 mL of washing buffer [8.3 mM Tris-

HCl (pH 7.5); 80 mM KOAc; 40 ?M EDTA; 55% (v/v) ethanol] were added. The 

midicolumn was placed inside a microtube and centrifuged at 8000 g for 2 min 

to remove any residual washing buffer. The plasmid DNA was eluted by loading 

300 ?L of sterile water at 70ºC. After incubating for 1 min, the column was 

centrifuged at 8000 g for 20 s to collect the eluted plasmid. The plasmid DNA 

solution was further centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min to precipitate column debris 

and the supernatant was stored at -20ºC. 

Digestion with endonucleases 

The digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases was performed according 

to standard procedures (Sambrook et al. 1989; Ausubel et al. 1996), following 

the supplier’s instructions. Acetylated BSA was used to stabilize endonuclease 

activity. Each reaction contained 1-15.5 ?L of DNA, 2 ?L enzyme buffer (10×, 

Roche), 2 ?L BSA (5 mg/mL, Stratagene), 0.5 ?L restriction enzyme and 

ultrapure water up to a final volume of 20 ?L. Reactions were performed at 

37°C, for 1.5 h to overnight.

CHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION 

~ 142 ~ 

5.1 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The invasion of habitats by alien species is a constant and fairly common 

process. Still, only a few species are able to establish and spread in the new 

territory. Human activity, however, is driving a dramatic increase on the 

frequency and number of invasions, unbalancing and endangering many 

ecosystems (Wells et al., 1986; di Castri, 1989; Cronk and Fuller, 1995). 

The migration of Hakea sericea from south-eastern Australia to countries such 

as South Africa, New Zealand or Portugal (Neser and Fugler, 1978; Weber, 

2003) is a perfect example of this reckless human activity. Initially introduced as 

a hedge plant to form fence lines or windbreaks, this Proteaceae species soon 

relied on its xeromorphic adaptations (Groom et al., 1997), high production, 

longevity and dispersion of seeds (Richardson et al. 1989), fire resistance from 

both seeds and rootstocks (Bradstock, 1991), and enhancement of nutrient 

uptake by proteoid roots (Shane and Lambers, 2005) to spread and overcome 

autochthon populations. Currently, H. sericeae has been reported as an 

aggressive invader in all of these new habitats. 

The north-western part of Portugal has been severely affected by the invasion 

of H. sericea, mainly triggered by the disruption of natural ecosystems by 

frequent forest fires. Taking this into account, one of the aims of the present 

work was to study possible approaches for controlling this invader. As necrotic 

lesions of unknown origin were detected in the leaves of wild shrubs of  

H. sericea growing in northern Portugal (“Serra de Arga”), the identification of a 

pathogenic agent able to infect H. sericea was carried out. Injured tissues were 

incubated on PDA, from which a fungal species was isolated. Based on 

morphological characters such as conidia form, cell number, pigmentation and 

number of appendages, the pathogenic agent was identified as belonging to the 

Pestalotiopsis genus. Since most species in this genus share the same 

morphological characters (Hu et al., 2007), classification at the species level 

was accomplished through the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genes 

molecular marker. The amplification and sequencing of ITS allowed the 

identification of the pathogen as Pestalotiopsis funerea. This ubiquitous species 



5.1 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

~ 143 ~ 

has been described has pathogenic for many plants, causing necrosis on 

infected tissues, that can ultimately lead to plant death. However, several 

studies regarding the influence of plant health (Keith et al., 2006) and 

environmental conditions (Tuset et al., 1999) on the success of P. funerea 

invasiveness have shown that this fungal agent behaves as an opportunistic 

pathogen mostly affecting stressed plants. This feature could make P. funerea a 

useful biological control tool in association with mechanical or chemical 

methods, since non-wounded authocton species would be safe from infection. 

Another main advantage of using P. funerea as a biological agent in northern 

Portugal relies on the fact that the pathogen was isolated from the invaded area 

by itself.  Consequently, it would not be introduced into the ecosystem for the 

first time, thus reducing the probability of collateral damage in autochthon 

species. 

Soils from the mountain areas of northern Portugal, likewise many found in 

Australia and in Cape region in South Africa (Lambers et al., 2006), tend to 

have a bellow average concentration of important mineral nutrients, particularly 

N and P. This would have a negative impact on the growth and development of 

most plant species. Conversely, H. sericea seems to be perfectly fit to cope with 

such harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, another aim of this work was 

to further understand the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying the ability of 

H. sericea to successfully establish in such Pi-poor soils. For studying Pi uptake 

by roots of H. sericea, an efficient hydroponic system was firstly developed. The 

growth of plants in different media showed that proteoid roots are only induced 

in solutions with low Pi concentrations – similarly to those found in the soils of 

“Serra de Arga”, in north-western Portugal. Through autoradiography of root 

fragments incubated in 32Pi, it was shown that proteoid roots present a higher 

effectiveness in uptaking Pi than non-proteoid roots. Pi uptake by itself seems 

to be dependent on proton gradient and yielded a biphasic kinetics, suggesting 

the involvement of H+/Pi co-transport systems with distinct substrate affinities 

(Km 225 nM and 40.8 µM Pi). Moreover, the high-affinity Pi transport component 

described in this work has the highest Pi affinity characterized to date in plant 

roots, matching the values described for Pi transport even in mycorrhiza. We 

suggest that the presence of a Pi uptake system with such high-affinity to Pi 



CHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION 

~ 144 ~ 

may confer an adaptive advantage for H. sericea over most plants in Pi-poor 

soils. 

Phosphate transport from soil to plant and across plant tissues and organelles 

occurs through the activity of phosphate transporters (PhT family). Members of 

PhT1 subfamily are involved in the uptake of Pi into the cell, thus being located 

in the plasma membrane. Transmembrane domain (TMD) prediction showed 

that all PhT1 members must have 12 TMD separated in two groups of six by a 

large hydrophilic charged loop. Phylogenetic analysis of 55 PhTs distributed 

across 13 plant species clustered PhT1 members altogether, forming two 

subgroups composed by either dicot or monocot proteins. Prediction of 

transmembrane domains in PhT2, a family of chloroplastidial H+/Pi symporters, 

suggests all members must also have 12 TMD. However, in opposition to PhT1 

members, the large hydrophilic loop is located between TMD8 and TMD9 and 

the N-terminal contains an extension that functions as a transit peptide, 

directing the protein to the chloroplast. The phylogenetic analysis shows that all 

analyzed PhT2 members cluster together and do not share homology with 

PhT1. Finally, the phylogenetic analysis suggests the existence of a new 

chloroplastidial Na+/Pi transporter family, with 10 predicted TMD and a long  

N-terminal chloroplastidial transit peptide. The existence of such family may be 

particularly relevant in halophytes or in plants living in alkaline media. In this 

work, four PhT members were found in H. sericea (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7). 

Transmembrane domain prediction of the deduced amino acid sequence 

suggests all four members belong to the PhT1 subfamily. However, since the 

complete nucleotide sequences of these H. sericea genes were not achieved, 

an accurate phylogenetic analysis including PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 was 

impaired. 

The possible relation between the amino acid sequence of PhT1 members and 

their main expression site was studied. Apparently the preferential expression 

site of any given PhT1 may not be inferred based only on its deduced amino 

acid sequenced. While some fairly unrelated proteins may be expressed in the 

same tissue (e.g. LaPT1 and LaPT2 in roots), structurally alike PhTs may be 

expressed in different plant organs (e.g. At1G20860 and At5G43340). 



5.2 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 

~ 145 ~ 

In Arabidopsis thaliana, genes enconding high-affinity PhTs are repressed in 

the presence of high concentrations of Pi (Dong et al., 1999). Conversely, when 

grown under high Pi concentration, H. sericea accumulates abnormal amounts 

of Pi in the root, stem and leaves that ultimately lead to foliar Pi toxicity 

symptoms. These results suggest that H. sericea may be unable to  

down-regulate the expression of high-affinity PhT genes in such experimental 

conditions. Since H. sericea inhabits Pi impoverished soils in its native habitat, 

an efficient mechanism for preventing excessive Pi uptake may have never 

been developed, or alternatively, could have been lost during evolution. 

5.2 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 

Following the work described in this thesis, several research lines can be 

suggested:  

a) Regarding the control of H. sericea with P. funerea, further studies are 

required before its environmental application. Since infection was only 

tested in six-weeks-old plants, an infection of adult specimens should be 

attempted. It would also be interesting to infect plants exposed to 

different stresses, such as drought, cold, mechanical injuries or excess 

Pi to predict in which conditions infection by P. funerea would be 

favoured. Collateral damage on autochthon populations should also be 

anticipated, by testing at lab scale the effect of P. funerea on these 

species. 

b) In what concerns Pi homeostasis, it would be imperative to complete the 

sequencing of the four genes identified in H. sericea genome. The 

expression analysis of these genes and their tissue specifity in plants 

under high- or low-Pi availability would allow the understanding of Pi 

transport regulation in this plant species. 

c)  The functional characterization of the identified Pi transporters genes 

through heterologous expression (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) would 

allow a more detailed study on their role, kinetic properties, energetics 

and specificity. 



CHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION 

~ 146 ~ 

d)  Finally, since P is frequently a limiting nutrient for plant growth, it would 

be interesting to assess if the over-expression of these high-affinity Pi 

transporters in other plant species would improve their ability to cope 

with Pi-poor soils. 

The work presented in this dissertation contributed to better understand the 

ecophysiological mechanisms underlying the ability of H. sericea to invade new 

habitats. A new pathogenic agent, P. funerea, was also described as harmful for 

this Australian Proteaceae. It is hoped that these studies can be a starting point 

for the development of integrated control strategies against this aggressive 

invader in Portuguese territory.
