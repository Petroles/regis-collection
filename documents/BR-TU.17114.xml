Overview of microfossil assemblages and palaeoecological signatures

Abstract: The successions across the Middle-Upper Jurassic disconformity in the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal), in particular those belonging
to the Oxfordian Caba~os formation, have rich microfossil assemblages, comprising mainly ostracods and charophytes, but also benthic foraminifera,
dasyclads, cyanobacteria, lncertae-sedis and palynomorphs. Recent detailed studies referring to many localities in the basin allowed a significant
improvement of the systematical knowledge of different groups, in particular of the ostracods and charophytes, and the recognition of associations
with palaeoecological significance, from the base upwards the sequences. The identified microfossil assemblages show variations in abundance and
in diversity ranges, which seem to primarily relate to salinity ranges and changing frequency. Matching of the micropaleontological results with facies
analysis, at a basinal scale, showed that the clearly linked regional palaeoecological signatures and evolution of palaeodepositional settings define two
basic trends across the basin, one typical of the western successions and the other typical of the eastern successions.

An overview of the main data concerning ostracods, foraminifera, dasyclads and charophytes is presented, including palaeobiogeographical
and biostratigraphical remarks. A brief mention to facies associations and their distribution over the basin is also made.

Resumo: As series associadas a desconformidade Jurassico medio-Jurassico superior na Bacia Lusit3.nica (Portugal), em especial as da
forma~ao de Caba~os (Oxfordiano), contem ricas associa~Oes de microf6sseis. Estas sao constitufdas, especialmente, por ostracodos e car6fitas, mas
tambem por foraminfferos bent6nicos, dasicladaceas, cianobacterias, lncertae-sedis e palinomorfos. Estudos pormenorizados recentes, abrangendo
diversas zonas da bacia, permitiram melhorar significativamente os conhecimentos relativos a Sistematica dos diferentes grupos, em particular dos
ostracodos e das car6fitas, bern como reconhecer associa~oes corn significado paleoecol6gico, da base para o topo das sequencias. As associa~Oes
reconhecidas mostram varia~Oes na diversidade e na abundancia relativa, as quais parecem estar relacionadas corn o teor e a frequencia de varia~ao
da salinidade e corn o grau de exposi~ao subaerea. A conjuga~ao dos resultados micropaleontol6gicos corn os da analise de facies, a escala bacinal,
demonstrou que a evolu~ao dos paleoambientes e as assinaturas paleoecol6gicas regionais, claramente relacionadas, definem dois padrOes, urn
caracterfstico da regiao oeste e outro da regiao leste da bacia.

Neste trabalho apresenta-se urna sfntese dos principais resultados relativos a ostracodos, foraminfferos, dasicladaceas e car6fitas e fazem-se
considera~Oes paleobiogeograficas e biostratigraficas. As associa~oes de facies e respectiva distribui~ao na bacia sao tambem sucintamente referidas.
