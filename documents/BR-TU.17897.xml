Abstract 

Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a fluorescence, measured in situ, can be applied as a tool to 

estimate primary production in the ocean over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. 

This non-invasive technique allows for fast assessments of photo-physiological 

parameters in contrast to the traditional methodologies (14C uptake and O2 evolution). 

The main photo-physiological parameters derived by the available instruments are yields, 

and as such, require careful interpretation. The comprehension of the main sources of 

variability of the photochemical and the light absorption efficiencies in marine 

phytoplankton has increased in the past years, largely by studies using monospecific 

cultures. In natural communities, however, the development of primary production 

models based on chlorophyll-a fluorescence remain limited as they are simultaneously 

subjected to a wide range of environmental and biological factors. This study will test the 

hypothesis that photo-physiological models for primary production estimates can be 

improved when key phytoplankton features, such as the pigments composition and 

dominant cell size, are taking into account. The approach was to contrast the photo-

physiological parameters derived from measurements in distinct oceanographic regions, 

as well as those derived in a specific environment with presented different nutrient 

concentration according to the time of sampling. In addition, we showed for monospecific 

cultures, how the photo-physiological parameters are quantitatively related to the 

production of carbon under the interactive effects of taxonomic composition and cell size. 

The proportions of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments present in the 

communitywere related to the bulk photochemical efficiency and the cross-section of 

light absorption, but varied among oceanographic regionsand the depthof the water 

column. A parameterization of fluorescence-derived primary production rates, using four 

dominant size classes, was derived for natural phytoplankton communities under different 

nutrients conditions in a coastal environment, showing that the parameters differed among 

size classes above a threshold of nutrient concentration. The direct conversion rates 

between fluorescence-derived primary production and carbon assimilation rates, 

computed for two distinct phytoplankton cell sizes grown in controlled laboratorial 

conditions, showed that cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light absorption and 

photochemistry, however species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy allocation 

dominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to carbon 

assimilation, i.e., in the electron requirements for carbon assimilation. The results 

highlighted the importance of the tight coupling of nutrients availability and 

phytoplankton communities, as well as for measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence 

in the ocean and primary production models. This work presents a novel contribution to 

the increasing efforts to apply fluorescence-based techniques to understand and 

parameterize primary production estimates in marine systems, especially at highly 

dynamic environments.

Resumo (Português) 

A fluorescência da clorofila-a do fitoplâncton, medida in situ, pode ser uma ferramenta 

para estimar produção primária no oceano em grande escala temporal e espacial. Esta 

técnica não-invasiva permite análises rápidas de parâmetros foto-fisiológicos ao contrário 

de metodologias tradicionais (assimilação de 14C e produção de O2). Os principais 

parâmetros foto-fisiológicos de instrumentos disponíveis hoje tratam-se de eficiências, e 

como tal, requerem cuidados em serem interpretados. A compreensão das principais 

fontes de variabilidade da eficiência fotoquímica e de absorção de luz no fitoplâncton 

marinho tem aumentado nos últimos anos, em sua maioria em cultivos monoespecíficos. 

Em comunidades naturais, entretanto, o desenvolvimento de modelos de produção 

primária baseados na fluorescência da clorofila-a ainda é limitado uma vez que estão 

sujeitos à uma ampla gama de fatores ambientais e biológicos. Esse estudo testa a hipótese 

de que modelos foto-fisiológicos para estimar produção primária podem ser aprimorados 

considerando-se características fundamentais do fitoplâncton, como a composição de 

pigmentos e tamanho celular dominante. A estratégia foi contrastar parâmetros foto-

fisiológicos derivados de medidas em regiões oceanográficas distintas, assim como 

medidas em um ambiente específico com diferentes concentrações de nutrientes ao longo 

do período amostrado. Adicionalmente, apresentamos através de cultivos 

monoespecíficos, como parâmetros foto-fisiológicos são quantitativamente relacionados 

à produção de carbono e os efeitos interativos da composição taxonômica e tamanho 

celular nessa relação. A proporção de pigmentos fotossintéticos e fotoprotetores da 

comunidade foram relacionados à eficiência fotoquímica e seção transversal de absorção 

de luz, porém variaram de acordo com a região oceanográfica e profundidade na coluna 

d’água. Uma parameterização de taxas de produção primária derivadas da fluorescência, 

usando quatro classes de tamanho dominantes, foi proposta para comunidades naturais de 

fitoplâncton sob condições de nutrientes diferentes em um ambiente costeiro, mostrando 

que os parâmetros diferiram entre as classes de tamanho acima de um limiar de 

concentração de nutrientes. As taxas de conversão diretas entre produção primária 

derivada da fluorescência e taxas de assimilação de carbono, computadas para dois 

tamanhos de fitoplâncton crescidos em condições controladas em laboratório, mostraram 

que tamanho celular influencia as eficiências de absorção de luz e fotoquímica, porém 

respostas espécie-específicas na alocação de energia fotossintética dominaram as 

diferenças observadas em como a luz absorvida é utilizada para assimilação de carbono, 

ou seja, na razão de elétrons exigidos para assimilação de carbono. Os resultados 

destacam a importância do acoplamento da disponibilidade de nutrientes com a 

comunidade fitoplanctônica, assim como das medidas de fluorescência da clorofila-a no 

oceano e nos modelos de produção primária. Este trabalho apresenta uma contribuição 

inédita nos esforços crescentes em aplicar técnicas baseadas na fluorescência para 

entender e parameterizar estimativas de produção primária nos sistemas marinhos, 

especialmente em ambientes altamente dinâmicos.

photosynthetic chain in the membrane of the thylakoids (right). The black retangle 

indicates the photosystem II (PSII) associated to the light harvesting antenna complex 

and the reactions centers (RCII), where the initial step of the electron transport chain 

occurs. The yellow arrows indicate where the light is absorbed by the thylakoids 

membrane and the red arrows are the pathways of the electron during the photosynthetic 

chain until the energy generation for the CO2 fixation at the Calvin cycle. More details

Figure 2. Three competing pathways of the absorbed photons by the PSII: photosynthesis 

(ØP), fluorescence (ØF) and heat dissipation (ØH). a - the probability of a photon to be 

directed to each of the paths are the same; b - the probability of a photon to be directed to 

photosynthesis is higher, due to the low light or dark-acclimation of the cells and c - the 

probability of fluorescence increases as light increases until all the PSII are closed (no 

photosynthesis) and the fluorescence are maximal. The arrows thickness is proportional 

to the relative contribution of each process ..................................................................... 06

CHAPTER 1 

 

General Introduction 

1. Methods for estimating primary production in the oceans 

Primary production rates by the marine phytoplankton provide CO2 fixation, 

O2 production and the synthesis of organic matter through the photosynthetic process 

(Falkowski and Raven 2007) for the largest portion of the global marine environments 

(Field et al. 1998; Longhurst 1998). In its simplest formulation, the photosynthesis can 

be described as: 

H2O + CO2 + light (photons) ? CH2O (organic matter) + O2 

where light is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments in the light harvesting 

antenna complex of phytoplankton cells which is then directed to the chlorophyll-a 

molecules present on the reaction centers (RC) of photosystem II (PSII). The efficiency 

with which the light energy is absorbed and directed to the photosynthetic process 

depend on a number of environmental constrains, such as nutritional and physiological 

states of the cells (Cleveland et al. 1989; Geider et al. 1993), irradiance fields (Long et 

al. 1994; Oxborough and Baker 2000) and water temperature (Kiefer and Mitchell 

1983). 

O2 evolution and CO2 fixation are described as the end products of 

photosynthesis are the most common methods to quantify primary production rates, 

both representing different biochemical reactions although tightly coupled (Ryther 

1956; Williams &amp;amp; Jenkinson 1982; Bender et al. 1987; Laws 1991) and are to date the 

most common methods to measure primary production. Other methods to quantify the 

end products of photosynthesis have been applied, based on stable isotope additions, 

using the labelled 13C and 18O as tracers (see Regaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). The 



2 

different methods and measurement protocols, such as incubation time, will provide 

rates of gross or net primary production. The gross primary production (GPP) is the 

total photosynthesis, while the net production (NPP) is the total photosynthesis minus 

the respiration rates.  

The standard method to estimate primary production in the ocean is to measure 

the uptake of radioactive 14C (Steeman-Nielsen 1952), which is sensitive in areas where 

phytoplankton biomass is low, especially in the open oceans. Oxygen production 

methods are less sensitive and require longer incubations (Bender et al. 1999) but can 

differentiate GPP from NPP, while 14C uptake estimates GPP or something in between 

GPP and NPP, depending on incubation time. However, both the 14C uptake and the O2 

production methods require incubation of samples for a certain period of time, 

generating methodological constraints driven by confinement of the samples in 

containers and consequently, alterations in the microorganisms composition and in the 

physiological status of phytoplankton (Eppley 1980; Bender et al. 1987; Grande et al. 

1989; Marra 2002). Samples contamination by trace metals can be another issue, mainly 

associated with14C stock solutions and the surfaces of the containers (Fitzwater et al. 

1982). Furthermore, there are still limitations regarding the results analysis, mostly 

associated with the uncertainties in the respiration and other metabolic rates (Bender et 

al. 1999; Williams et al. 2002). The respiration during incubation periods can 

effectively recycle fixed CO2 depending on the incubation time, thus preventing the 

accurate discrimination of gross from net primary production rates (Marra 2002; 

Regaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). 

2. Fluorescence-derived primary production 

To overcome some of the challenges associated with conventional 

measurements of primary production rates in the oceans, non-invasive techniques 



3 

(incubation-free) based on variations in the active fluorescence of chlorophyll-a have 

been developed (Kolber &amp;amp; Falkowski, 1993). The active fluorescence method quantifies 

the fluorescence emission by PSII during the photosynthetic process (Genty et al. 1989; 

Falkowski et al. 1986).  

The photosynthetic apparatus in marine phytoplankton is composed of two 

photosynthetic units (PSI and PSII) distributed in the thylakoid membrane, inside the 

chloroplasts of the photosynthetic organisms (Figure 1). These units are responsible for 

the photochemical reactions that fix the carbon and oxidize the water molecules to 

produce the oxygen. These reactions are linked to the transference of electrons. 

 
Figure 1. Distribution of thylakoids inside the chloroplasts (above) highlighting the 

photosynthetic chain occuring in the membrane of the thylakoids (below). The black retangle 

indicates the PSII associated with the light harvesting antenna complex and the reactions centers 

(RCII), where the initial step of the electron transport chain occurs. The yellow arrows indicate 

where the light is absorbed by the thylakoids membrane and the red arrows are the pathways of 

the electron during the photosynthetic chain until the energy generation for the CO2 fixation at 

the Calvin cycle. More details of the reactions are in the text (Figure adapted from Huot and Babin 

2010). 

 



4 

The PSII contain the light harvesting complex (LHCII), which are antenna 

pigment complexes, and the reaction centers (RCII), which is composed of a core 

complex of proteins and chlorophylls and it is where the first step of electron transfer 

occurs. When the chlorophyll-a molecules of the RCII receive the energy from light 

absorption, an electron is donated to a primary electron acceptor, the Quinone A (QA) 

molecule, where the linear electron flow begins (see red arrows in Figure 1). 

The linear electron flow generates a proton gradient (H+) between the exterior 

of the thylakoid (stroma) and the interior of the thylakoid (lumen), through a series of 

reduction and oxidation reactions. The H+ gradient across the thylakoid membrane is 

responsible for generating energy (ATP), through the ATP-synthase, also part of the 

thylakoid membrane (Figure 1). Further in the photosynthetic chain, the PSI is 

responsible for donating the electron to the end electron acceptor (ferrodoxin – Fd) that 

with the ferrodoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) reduces NADP to NADPH. The ATP and 

NADPH produced are energy sources to the carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle.  

When a chlorophyll-a molecule in the antenna pigments complex absorbs 

photons, magnesium (Mg) atoms of the chlorophyll are excited from a lower (ground) 

to a higher (excited) energy state. When the chlorophyll-a molecule returns to its ground 

state, the energy released has two possible pathways (Figure 2): i. dissipation by heat, ii. 

transfer by inductive resonance to the adjacent molecules towards the reaction centers to 

be directed to the photochemical process and iii. re-emission of photons by a process 

called as fluorescence (Falkowski and Raven 2007; Govindjee 2004). The proportions 

of absorbed photons that are directed to each of the three competing pathways are 

represented by the quantum yield of energy dissipation (ØH), photosynthesis (ØP) and 

fluorescence (ØF), respectively (Figure 2a). The quantum yields are, thus, directly 

related to the probability of the three distinct processes to occur (Govindjee 1995; 



5 

Papageorgiou and Govindjee 2004). When the energy is directed to the photosynthetic 

activity, the fluorescence is reduced by the so-called photochemical quenching (qP), 

while the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) refers to the energy dissipation by heat. 

Assuming the quantum yields for energy dissipation as constant, the quantum 

yields for photosynthesis and fluorescence will be high and low, respectively, in 

darkness or very low light, as the PSII molecules are open and available to receive 

photons (Figure 2b). As light intensity increases, the QA molecules become reduced and 

the PSII close accordingly, increasing the quantum yields of fluorescence. When all the 

PSII are closed, the subsequent photons absorbed are then re-emitted as fluorescence, 

until a maximum fluorescence quantum yield is reached (Figure 2c). Note that the 

dissipation by heat has to be considered constant for this simple model to work. 

However, the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and photochemistry 

becomes non-linear as a suite of heat losses mechanisms will come into play when cells 

are exposed to high light (Papageorgiou and Govindjee 2004; Lin et al. 2016).

Figure 2. Three competing pathways of the absorbed photons by the PSII: photosynthesis (ØP), 

fluorescence (ØF) and heat dissipation (ØH). a) the probability of a photon to be directed to each 

of the paths are the same; b) the probability of a photon to be directed to photosynthesis is higher, 

due to the low light or dark-acclimation of the cells and c) the probability of fluorescence increases 

as light increases until all the PSII are closed (no photosynthesis) and the fluorescence are 

maximal. The arrows thickness is proportional to the relative contribution of each process. 

 

The simple model of competing quantum yields assumes that the fluorescence 

quantum yield, or fluorescence efficiency, varies inversely to the photochemical 

efficiency, depending on the proportion of open reactions centers (Kiefer and Reynolds 

1992), defined as the fluorescence path dynamics. Therefore, changes in fluorescence 

quantum yields provide information on the photosynthetic process (Kolber and 

Falkowski 1993), and that is the principle applied in the available commercial 

fluorometers. The instruments are designed to measuring the fluorescence from PSII 

derived from the induction of a maximal fluorescence and provide photo-physiological 

parameters that are related to the proportion of “closed” reaction centers during 

photosynthesis (Kolber and Falkowski, 1993; Suggett et al. 2003; Oxborough et al. 

2012).  

The fluorescence technique uses the emission of a saturating light (usually in 

the blue wavelength) that is strong enough to promote the variable fluorescence in a 



7 

time scale of µs, reducing all QA, thus saturating the photochemical path and promoting 

the maximal fluorescence. In darkness, when all the PSII are open and available to 

conduct photons to the photosynthesis, the fluorescence emitted by these molecules is 

minimal or basal, which is represented by F0. As incident light increases, the 

fluorescence increases up to a maximum value, designated Fm, when all the PSII are 

closed. The variable fluorescence (Fv) is the difference between Fm and F0 (Fv= Fm - F0) 

and the ratio Fv/Fm is a measurement of how efficient the cells saturate the 

photochemical capacity and reaches the maximal fluorescence yield (Lazar 1999; 

Maxwell and Johnson, 2000). In ambient light, the ratio between Fv and Fm is defined as 

the effective photochemical efficiency (or Fq?/Fm?), and will be smaller than the 

maximum observed in cells dark-acclimated samples, as the pool of open PSII to 

receive photons is smaller. Other parameter that is derived from the variable 

fluorescence methods is related to the efficiency to which the energy captured by 

incident light is converted to electron transfer process in PSII, defined as the functional 

absorption cross-section of PSII (?PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993).  

The Kolber and Falkowski (1993) model estimates the electron transfer rate 

(ETR) in phytoplankton cells, which is considered as an alternative tool to estimate 

primary production in aquatic environments (Suggett et al. 2010). A detailed 

explanation of how ETR is calculated from photo-physiological parameters, and how it 

relates to carbon fixation and primary production rates, will be given in chapters 3 and 4 

of this document. The most commonly used active fluorometers in oceanography are 

single turnover Fast Repetition Rate-type fluorometer (FRRf) (Kolber et al. 1998), and 

their derivatives, such as the Fluorescence Induction and Relaxation System (FIRe) 

(Gorbunov and Falkowski 2005). The protocols for exciting and measuring variable 

fluorescence are distinct among instruments, however they provide very similar photo-



8 

physiological responses. The correct interpretation of the results provided by the 

different instruments and protocols are not straightforward and deserve caution (Huot 

and Babin 2010). A number of studies are still required before variable fluorescence 

techniques become the standard primary production methods in the oceans, especially 

for natural phytoplankton communities. 

3. Hypothesis and goals 

The present work is based on the general hypothesis that the photo-

physiological model for primary production estimates can be parameterized and 

improved considering key phytoplankton features. Considering that the environmental 

conditions impose a large impact on the phytoplankton communities and thus in the 

photo-physiology, this work comprises a large dataset with contrasting oceanographic 

regimes. The central objective was then to contribute for a better understanding of the 

chlorophyll-a fluorescence technique and its main sources of variation, as well as to 

propose parameterizations according to the phytoplankton community structure, such as 

cell size classes and their pigments composition. In addition, we have shown how the 

variable fluorescence can be converted in carbon-based primary production estimates, 

and the interactive effects of taxonomy and cell size on this conversion. Thus, the 

specific objectives were approached in the following chapters: 

Chapter 2: To describe the photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and ?PSII) of 

natural phytoplankton communities across distinct oceanographic regimes and trophic 

status at a large portion of the subtropical Atlantic Ocean, with emphasis on the 

relationships between such photo-physiological parameters and the pigment ratios of the 

phytoplankton community. We hypothesize that the use of pigments ratios would 

significantly improve the description and interpretation of Fv/Fm and ?PSII across 

different oceanographic regimes as these ratios represent not only biomass and 



9 

taxonomy, but also the interactions among taxonomy and acclimation processes, which 

will reflect in the bulk signal of the community photo-physiology. 

Chapter 3: to examine the relationship between the dominant size of natural 

phytoplankton communities and variability of photo-physiological parameters, i.e. 

Fv/Fm and ?PSII, simultaneously considering different ambient nutrients conditions. The 

sampling design allowed discrimination of the effects of different levels of nutrient 

availability from cell size on the parameterization of fluorimetric photo-physiology 

models. 

Chapter 4: to examine for the first time whether cell size influences photo-

physiological performance and light harvesting properties, specifically the direct 

comparison of ETR and carbon fixation, as well as allocation of inorganic assimilated 

carbon into organic cell compounds, testing the consistency across different 

phytoplankton taxonomical groups with well-documented differences in photosynthetic 

physiology.

CHAPTER 2 

 

Relationships between photophysiological fluorescence-derived parameters and 

the composition of phytoplankton pigments observed in distinct oceanographic 

processes in the subtropical South Atlantic 

1. Introduction 

In the ocean, phytoplankton growth responds to a large dynamic range of 

limitation by resources (Falkowski 1994) and biological interactions that are, at first 

order, governed by the dynamics of the environment (Cullen et al. 2002). Oceanic 

processes of varied temporal and spatial scales determine light and nutrient availability 

that not only alter phytoplankton abundances and species composition but also control 

their activities and consequently role on biogeochemical cycles (Gargett and Marra 

2002). Over the scales of main oceanographic processes, therefore, it is of equal 

importance to measure the variability of phytoplankton abundances (Longhurst et al. 

1995) and their photosynthetic performances (Huot et al. 2007a). 

Spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton abundance can be inferred 

from satellite images derived from ocean color sensors over large horizontal scales 

(O’Reilly et al. 1998), while small-scale variability of phytoplankton abundance is 

usually estimated by simple fluorimeters (Lorenzen 1966). Both ocean color and 

fluorimetric approaches easily estimate chlorophyll concentrations as a proxy for 

phytoplankton abundance, which despite of its important prediction power for 

photosynthetic parameters (Huot et al. 2007b) cannot account alone for primary 

production rates, especially over large scales (e.g., Saba et al. 2011). Primary production 

classic techniques are expensive and time-consuming limiting, thus, temporal and 

spatial coverage (see Regaudie-de-Gioux et al. 2014). 



11 

Instruments that provide near-real time estimates of photosynthetic 

performance of natural phytoplankton communities have been available for many years. 

These non-invasive techniques are based on measurements of variable fluorescence and 

its relationship with the electrons transfer rates (ETR, with units of mol e- (molPSII)-1 h-

1, where PSII is the photosystem unit of the cells), during the photosynthesis (Kolber 

and Falkowski 1993). Key parameters derived from variable fluorescence measurements 

include the maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), directly related with the 

photosynthetic performance, and the functional absorption cross-section (?PSII), which is 

a function of the light harvesting efficiency and utilization by the bulk phytoplankton 

community. However, the complexity of fluorescence by phytoplankton (Lazár 1999) in 

addition to the different protocols available (Huot and Babin 2010), makes the 

interpretation of results derived from variable fluorescence far from straightforward 

(Suggett et al. 2010). It is important to note that variable fluorescence originates almost 

exclusively from the chlorophyll molecules present in the photosystems. 

 When the variable fluoresce technique is applied to phytoplankton cultures 

grown in laboratory, the observed values for Fv/Fm and ?PSII have been associated with 

taxonomic composition, cell size (Suggett et al. 2009) and modes of nutrient supply 

(Parkhill et al. 2001). In natural phytoplankton communities, Fv/Fm and ?PSII also vary 

with taxonomic composition and cell size but can also respond strongly to photo-

acclimation and photo-adaptation (Moore et al. 2006), especially in nutrient-limited 

environments (Moore et al. 2008; Suggett et al. 2009). Because of that, the relationships 

between the photo-physiological parameters and natural communities may also vary 

remarkably with depth. A common observed feature in stratified oceans is the deep 

chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer, which is maintained by a number of distinct 

processes that range from enhanced growth driven by nutrients to selection of photo-



12 

adapted and photo-aclimated populations, from eutrophic to oligotrophic environments 

respectively (Cullen 2015). Thus, the photo-physiological parameters of distinct 

phytoplankton communities are expected to vary between surface and the DCM, but not 

predictably across a range of trophic status. 

For a given oceanographic process that provide a gradient of nutrient supply, 

and therefore, a gradient of trophic status composed of different phytoplankton 

communities (see discussion in Ciotti et al. 1999), we hypothesized that observed values 

of Fv/Fm and ?PSII will resemble that presented by Suggett et al. (2009), with Fv/Fm 

increasing from oligotrophic to eutrophic areas, while ?PSII decreases, as communities 

will change dominance from small to larger cells. These gradient of cell size is expected 

to alter the efficiency for light absorption as well (Ciotti et al. 2002), which will tend to 

decrease with increasing cell size. Ciotti et al. (in preparation) have shown that the 

variability observed in pigment packaging at the surface is much higher than that 

observed in the DCM across large trophic gradients in the Atlantic and Pacific. 

There are no universal metrics for a given phytoplankton community and 

common approaches simplify the taxonomy of natural communities according with 

dominance of major groups given by either microscopy-cytometry or pigment profiles. 

A selection of diagnostic marker pigments (Claustre 1994) can be used to indicate major 

taxonomical groups present (Mackey 1996, Jeffrey et al. 2011) or to assign dominance 

of phytoplankton size fractions (e.g. Vidussi et al. 2001; Uitz et al. 2006). Indeed, when 

present in substantial proportions, a diagnostic pigment provides a robust tool indicating 

the presence of a given taxonomic group. However, some of the pigments excluded 

from these procedures could help to explain the variability observed in 

photophysiological parameters.  



13 

In ocean, where phytoplankton are subject to highly dynamic environmental 

conditions, the taxonomical classification from pigments into specific groups might be 

precluded by the variability of cellular pigment proportions as a response of 

physiological state (Henriksen et al. 2002). Pigments concentration, and especially their 

proportion to chlorophyll-a concentration, may indicate nutrient-limited growth 

(Goerick and Montoya 1998; Henriksen et al. 2002) and photoacclimation processes 

(Macintyre et al. 2002). Detection of chlorophyll-a degradation products can also be 

used as bulk physiological index, such as the proportion of chlorophyllide originated 

from senescence (Jefrey 1974, Wright et al. 2010), but no information of the extent to 

which Fv/Fm and ?PSII can be explained by phytoplankton pigment composition, without 

a priori classification into specific taxonomic groups, is available. We hypothesize that 

the use of pigments ratios would significantly improve the description and interpretation 

of Fv/Fm and ?PSII across different oceanographic regimes as these ratios represent not 

only biomass and taxonomy, but also the interactions among taxonomy and acclimation 

processes, which will reflect in the bulk signal of the community photo-physiology.  

The objectives of the present work are characterizing the photo-physiology of 

phytoplankton communities using chlorophyll-a fluorescence-derived parameters (Fv/Fm 

and ?PSII) in different oceanographic processes of the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean, 

contrasting the observations from surface and from DCM. The photo-physiological 

parameters were related to pigment ratios across distinct oceanographic regimes and 

trophic status. The relationships found between photo-physiology and individual 

pigments were compared to those observed between other physiological indexes, based 

on pigments, such as the sum of total photosynthetic (PSC) and photo-protective 

carotenoids (PPC) (Barlow et al. 2002), size fractions in the community (Uitz et al. 

2006) and an index of degradation products (Wright et al. 2010).  In addition, the effects 



14 

of an index for pigments packaging, or size factor (S(f); Ciotti et al. 2002) on the photo-

physiology was evaluated. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Study Area 

Contrasting oceanographic regions were sampled during the spring and early 

summer of 2011 in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, as part of the CO2 South Atlantic 

Subtropical project. The cruise attended a multidisciplinary study focused on better 

understanding phytoplankton dynamics and ocean-atmospheric fluxes of carbon. The 

cruise left Rio Grande, Brazil (32°1’S; 52°5’W) on October 24 2011 and crossed the 

35?S meridian to Cape Town, Africa, returning to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22°55”S; 

43°9’W) in December 23 2011. The 35?S transect was chosen due to the reports of 

important CO2 input from the atmosphere are (Takahashi et al. 2009; Khatiwala et al. 

2009) combined to the lack of in situ data of this sector of the South Atlantic Ocean. 

The dynamic range of oceanographic conditions is expected to provide conditions of 

diverse phytoplankton communities with contrasting pigment compositions and 

photosynthetic activities.  

The surface water masses in this sector of the Atlantic Ocean are forced by the 

atmospheric systems associated with the South Equatorial and Circumpolar Currents 

(Peterson and Stramma 1991) that defines the mean latitudinal position of the 

Subtropical Front (STF) in response to the expansion and contraction of the South 

Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (McClain et al. 2004). During austral spring and summer, 

high phytoplankton standing stocks are observed along the STF (suggested by ocean 

color imagery - Tilstone et al. 2009) consistent with net CO2 fluxes from the 

atmosphere. Studies also suggest increase in primary production rates in this region 

related to the increase in photosynthetic rates (e.g. Maranan and Holligan 1999).  



15 

Notable features associated with the STF are mesoescale eddies, which disturbs the 

vertical position of the picnocline and can either promote input from nutrients from 

bellow stimulating phytoplankton growth (McGillicuddy et al. 2007) or transport 

surface waters bellow (Omand et al. 2015). 

The observations were carried out over four distinct areas: i) a section across 

the continental margin near the plume of La Plata river (n(surface)= 7 and n(DCM)= 8), ii) a 

longitudinal section across the South Atlantic Subtropical Front (STF) (n(surface)= 55 and 

n(DCM)= 41), iii) a section across the upwelling near Benguela (n(surface)= 9 and n(DCM)= 

5), and iv) a section across the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (n(surface)= 20 and 

n(DCM)= 17) (Figure 1). Details about sectors i to iii can be found in Lencina-Avila et al 

(2016).

December 2011), departing from Brazil to Africa in a survey across 35?S of latitude adjacent to 

the Subtropical Front. The second leg of the cruise, departed from Cape Town, crossing the 

Benguela upwelling area and followed towards Brazil, crossing the Subtropical Gyre. 

Discontinuities of stations refers to bad weather and operational problems. 

 

2.2. Oceanographic data and phytoplankton pigment analysis 

In each oceanographic station, the vertical physical structure of the water 

masses was obtained from casts of a CTD SBE 911 profiler, equipped with temperature, 

salinity, pressure, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence and beam attenuation of 



16 

light sensors. The CTD was attached to a rosette system equipped with 12 Niskin bottles 

with 5L of capacity. Two separated casts were performed in each station: one to a 

maximum depth for chemical samples, followed by a cast limited to 300m for biological 

samples. Vertical transects of temperature were also measured with XBT Deep Blue 

profilers (surface to 760 m, provided by NOAA) in all stations and between stations. 

The gaps in Figure 1 represent logistical problems and unfavorable weather. 

During the cruise, the oceanographic features were followed using ocean color 

satellite images to monitor alterations on sea surface temperature (SST) and estimated 

chlorophyll concentration. Composites of 8 days were used 

(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cms/). In addition, the presence or absence of eddies 

was determined using high resolution weekly maps of Sea Level Anomaly (DT-MSLA), 

obtained for the period of the cruise. The altimeter products were produced by 

Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by Aviso (Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of 

Satellite Oceanographic), with support from Cnes (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/duacs). 

Vortices and eddies were identified according to Chaigneau et al. (2009). These 

analyses were performed by Dr. C.A.E. Garcia’s group at FURG, co-coordinator of the 

CO2 South Atlantic Subtropical project. 

Samples for chlorophyll-a concentration and photo-physiological parameters 

were chosen based on density and fluorescence profiles to represent when possible: i) 

the surface layer (4-8 meters), ii) the bottom of the mixed layer depth, iii) the depth of 

maximum fluorescence, iv) an intermediary between ii and iii; and v) bottom of the 

fluorescence peak. From a total of 92 samples, approximately 75 presented a remarkable 

DCM. When a DCM was not clearly observed, we have considered the highest 

fluorescence value (chlorophyll-a concentration), below the mixing layer, when higher 

than the surface values. High Performance Liquid Chromatography quantified pigment 



17 

profiles only for the surface and depth of maximum fluorescence. Sub-samples of 500 

ml and 2L, for chlorophyll-a and HPLC pigments, respectively, were concentrated onto 

GF/F filters and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis in the laboratory.  

Chlorophyll-a were extracted in 5mL 90% acetone + DMSO solution (6:4 – 

Shoaf and Lium 1976) for 24h in dark at -20°C, and quantified using a calibrated Turner 

AU-10 fluorimeter, through the non-acidification method (Welschmeyer 1994). A 

calibration factor obtained from a commercial chlorophyll-a standard (Sigma-Aldrich) 

was used to calculate the final chlorophyll-a concentration of fluorescence 

measurements.  

The procedures for measuring chlorophylls, degradation products and accessory 

carotenoids measured by HPLC followed the method from Zapata et al. (2000), 

modified by Mendes et al. (2007). Pigments were identifiedfrom both absorbance 

spectra and retention times from the signals in thephotodiode array detector (SPD-

M20A; 190 to 800 nm; 1 nm wavelengthaccuracy) or fluorescence detector (RF-

10AXL; Ex. 430 nm/Em. 670 nm). Pigments were automatically quantified from peak 

integration provided by the LC-Solution software (Shimadzu), but all peak integrations 

were checked manually and corrected when necessary. The HPLC system was 

previously calibrated with pigment standards from DHI (Institute for Water 

andEnvironment, Denmark).  

A total of 21 pigments were quantified, including chlorophylls, accessory 

photosynthetic pigments and accessory carotenoids (Table 1). The presence of some 

unambiguous marker pigments was used to infer the presence or changes in the 

proportion of specific phytoplankton groups, without assuming quantitative 

relationships. These were: Fucoxanthin as a marker for Diatoms, Hex-Fucoxanthin + 

Chl c2 and c3 for Haptophytes, Zeaxanthin for Synechococcus and DV-Chla for 



18 

Prochlorococcus (Wright and Jeffrey 2006; Jeffrey et al. 2011). Some pigments-based 

physiological indexes such as PSC and PPC (Barlow et al. 2002) were computed, as 

well as an index of degradation product of chlorophyll (Wright et al. 2010). 

An index to derive the fraction of small size phytoplankton (f_pico) was 

calculated based on diagnostic pigments of small groups, according to Uitz et al. (2006) 

(Equation 1). 

f_pico = 1.01 Chl b + 0.86 Zea / ?DP                                 Eq (1) 

where ?DP = 1.41 Fuco + 1.41 Perid + 1.27 Hex-fuco + 0.35 But-fuco + 0.60 Allo + 

1.01 Chl b + 0.86 Zea 

A size parameter (or S(f), size factor) was calculated based on the phytoplankton 

community absorption spectra, which will refer to the combined effects of pigment 

packaging and concentration and composition of accessory pigments (Ciotti et al. 2002). 

The phytoplankton absorption data was obtained from a filter-pad technique, according 

to Tassan and Ferrari (1998), using a spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35.

2.3. Photo-physiological data 



19 

The subsamples used for determination of photo-physiological parameters were 

analyzed using a fluorescence induction and relaxation technique (Gorbunov and 

Falkowski, 2004), which yields the maximal photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) and the 

functional cross-section of light absorption (?PSII) of the phytoplankton community. 

Samples were dark-adapted for 30 to 60 minutes, at room temperature, in clean dark 

glass bottles and processed in flow-through mode with a bench-top FIRe instrument 

(Satlantic). The flow-through mode allows for better signal to noise results without 

damaging the cells with the multiple sequential flashes necessary for the procedure. The 

flow-through cuvette was rinsed with the dark acclimated samples for 2 minutes before 

the fluorescence profiles were registered for about 5 minutes. Note that in flow-through 

mode, the Fire instrument gain is automatically adjusted according mainly to the 

chlorophyll concentration. Because of that, blanks were processed as samples and all 

raw data were processed using a software package developed by MSc. Audrey Barnett 

(Fireworx 1.0.4 - https://sourceforge.net/p/fireworx/news/), developed for matlab. 

Blanks were 0.2µm filtrates of a nylon capsule filter (Polycap 75AS, Whatman) of each 

sample. Between stations, the cuvette was rinsed with a diluted solution of neutral soap 

and freshly produced mili-q water. The steps of Fireworx routine also included the 

normalization of data by the calibration of the blue led used (Figure 2). For logistic 

problems, the calibration files were prepared in the laboratory using known chlorophyll-

a solutions several months after the cruise. Nonetheless, the instrument was monitored 

monthly before, during and after the cruise with a fluorescent dye and no significant 

response changes were observed in the past year. All parameters (i.e., Fo, Fm and ?PSII) 

are means of all profiles adjusted during the 5 minutes of data collection that yielded 14 

to 15 profiles in general. A quality control for the parameters was applied, for which 



20 

samples with coefficients of variation higher than 30% among the 5 minutes running 

were excluded.

software) to obtain Fv/Fm and ?PSII 

 

2.4. Data analysis 

As mentioned before, the cruise sampled contrasting oceanographic regions 

(Figure 1), and the dataset were divided according: 1. The transect from coast to open 

ocean crossing the south continental shelf of  Brazil under the influence of the La Plata 



21 

river plume; 2. The 35°S longitudinal section, influenced by mesoscale vertical 

instabilities across the STF; 3. The south Africa coastal waters, affected by the 

Benguela upwelling; and 4. The session across the subtropical oligotrophic gyre and  

the Brazil Current. For each region, near surface and the maximum fluorescence depth 

were treated separately.  Note that general relationships between Fv/Fm and ?PSII and 

chlorophyll-a were also constructed using fluorimetric data, providing a higher vertical 

resolution. The distribution of phytoplankton and the photo-physiological characteristics 

of the community were discussed in terms of the main physical drivers of the 

hydrographic structure for each of the four sectors, where relationships were tested 

through linear regression analysis and vertical profiles sections. 

The relationships between the photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and functional 

cross-section of light absorption (?PSII) were analyzed for each of the sectors, as well as 

for different layers (surface versus DCM). Although the relationships between both 

parameters found in the literature does not suggest a unique and strictly linear trajectory, 

as well as same taxonomic signatures (Moore et al. 2006, Fishwick et al. 2006; Suggett 

et al. 2009), we decided to present as such as a simple approach for comparison among 

sectors and depths, since our goal is not to derive a unique equation, but to identify 

consistent deviations. 

 A series of pairwise correlations were tested among the ratios of individual 

pigments and the total accessory pigments (Pigs/?AP) and the photo-physiological 

parameters, also for the different sectors. Additional parameters were expected to 

correlate to Fv/Fm and ?PSII, such as S(f), f_pico, PSC, PPC, Chlide/TChla, and were also 

tested. Those analyses were performed at the statistic software R. 

3. Results

22 

The four sectors sampled showed expected contrasting oceanographic 

characteristics (Figure 3), and because of that, they are characterized by distinct sources 

for nutrient supply to the surface layers (not shown), resulting in distinct phytoplankton 

community structures, as will be presented below.  

 

Figure 3. T-S diagrams for each of the analyzed sectors across the Southern Atlantic Ocean 

 

The surface waters presented the largest range of variability in chlorophyll-a 

concentration in all sectors, with highest concentrations observed at the surface of 

Benguela sector (up to 5 mg m-3) and the lowest at the Gyre (Figure 4). The highest 

Fv/Fm was also observed for the surface waters of the Benguela, varying from 0.29 to 

0.56, and lowest at the 35°S sector, which varied from 0.11 to 0.38 at the surface and 

0.16 to 0.38 at DCM, which shows a phytoplankton community, in general, represented 



23 

by low photochemical efficiency. In this sector, ?PSII varied from 154 to 296 Å²/photon 

at the surface and 197 to 299 Å²/photon at DCM.  Fv/Fm at the surface of the Gyre sector 

were not computed due to the low signal-to-noisy ratio of the dataset, however at DCM, 

despite the low chlorophyll-a concentrations, Fv/Fm was higher than at 35°S, ranging 

from 0.22 to 0.49. The mean values of Fv/Fm and ?PSII at the Benguela sector were 

similar to the La Plata sector, except for the higher values of ?PSII at the surface in the 

Benguela sector (Figure 4). Fv/Fm and ?PSII were not significantly different between both 

layers, especially due to the low dynamic range of this parameters, except at the 35°S 

where Fv/Fm at the surface was higher than the DCM (t-test, p&lt;0.01). 

The main differences in the pigments ratios among the sectors are the higher 

DV-Chl/Tot Chla in the Gyre, along with a robust contribution of Chl b at DCM, as 

well as the large contribution of Zeaxanthin in the surface at this sector (Figure 5). The 

La Plata and Benguela sectors presented the largest contribution of Fucoxanthin 

(Fuco/?AP), while a significant increase in the Hex-Fucoxanthin ratios were observed 

at surface and DCM at the 35°S (Figure 5).

Atlantic Ocean. The acronyms in the x-axis are as in Table 1. 

 

The relationships between photophysiological parameters and the 

oceanographic characteristics of each sector are described below: 

Sector 1: La Plata plume waters 

The observations from the La Plata sector clearly showed the influence of the Plata 

Plume Water (PPW) at the surface waters over the continental shelf, with salinity values 



26 

below 33 (Figure 6). Offshore, due to the encounter of Brazil and Malvinas Currents, 

observed water masses included the Subtropical Shelf Water (STSW) at the surface of 

the continental shelf break and the SACW over continental slope (Figure 3a). 

 

Figure 6. Salinity section at the La Plata influenced waters (above) and the relationship between 

Fv/Fm and ?PSII at the DCM of the La Plata sector, indicating the trajectory of increase in salinity 

values (below) 

 

Both Fv/Fm and ?PSII were highly correlated with salinity at the DCM (r²=0.67 

and 0.66, respectively), with lower ?PSII and higher Fv/Fm at low salinity waters, which 

were also related with higher Chl-a concentrations (Figure 6). The expected negative 

relationship between Fv/Fm and ?PSII (see Chapter 3) was only observed at the DCM 

(r²=0.51, n=9). 

Sector 2: 35ºS section across de STF 



27 

Sharp vertical temperature gradients are observed across the entire section, due 

to the high spatial resolution between CTD casts, and a number of mesoescale features 

of the picnocline are clearly observed (Figure 7), likely related to the presence of 

cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies. Indeed, maps of Sea Surface Height (SSH) derived 

from altimetry (Figure 8) suggested the presence of an anti-cyclonic eddy at 5°E 

longitude, associated with a deepening of the picnocline (Figure 7). On the other hand, a 

shallowing of the picnocline between 10 and 20°W, suggesting an upwelling center 

associated with a mesoscale cyclonic eddy (Figure 8), promoted an increase in the 

chlorophyll-a concentration at the euphotic zone, and CTD fluorimeter casts suggest 

that the deep chlorophyll maximum remained above 60 meters responding to the 

feature.

Ocean

during the cruise (first leg from Brazil to Africa coast). The sampling stations are indicated in 

green. The red and blue cores indicate warm anticyclonic and cold cyclonic eddies, respectively.  

 

The vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a throughout the first 50m is 

proportional to the vertical distribution of the functional absorption cross-section, 

especially between 10 and 20°W (Figure 9), where an increase in chlorophyll-a 

concentration was associated with higher ?PSII. This patch of increased biomass was 

coincident with an increase in the relative proportion of diatoms, suggested by the 

diagnostic pigment Fucoxanthin, also corroborated by data obtained with the FlowCam 

(data not shown). However, higher photochemical efficiency would be expected, along 

with lower absorption cross-section. At DCM, the ratios of Fucoxanthin was also higher 

between 10 and 20°W.

Atlantic Ocean.  

 

Sector 3: Benguela upwelling  

The sector over the Benguela upwelling system shows low temperature waters 

reaching the surface over the continental shelf. Note however that the section of 

transects was oriented from Cape Town southwards to complete the 35?S latitude line 

that had to be interrupted in the first leg of the cruise (Figure 10).  Because of that, large 

gradients were observed in both temperature and salinity offshore, especially in the 

upper layers. In this sector, the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations were observed, 

reaching 8µgm-3, associated to the coldest waters. 



30 

Positive relationships between Fv/Fm and temperature at the surface and 

between ?PSII and temperature at the DCM were observed. Thus, although the number of 

samples is low to assign robust correlations, samples associated with the upwelled 

waters tended to present low Fv/Fm and low ?PSII.

second leg of the cruise. The map shows the stations track to highlight the southward direction of 

this sampling. 

 

Sector 4: Subtropical gyre at 30ºS and Brazil Current  

The sector crossed the Subtropical Gyre towards the 30°S at the Brazilian 

coast, also intercepting the warm Brazil Current, between 30 and 40°W (Figure 11). 

Picnocline was deeper than in the 35°S sector, forcing the DCM deeper as well (about 

100m). Warm core eddies can be clearly observed at the SSH data from altimetry 

(Figure 12), which were probably originated at the Agulhas Current, especially at 5°W 

and 10°W.

obtained during the cruise (second leg from Africa to Brazil coast). The sampling stations are 

indicated in green. The red and blue cores indicate warm anticyclonic and cold cyclonic eddies, 

respectively. 

 

The oligotrophic Gyre and Brazil Current waters were associated, as expected, 

with low chlorophyll-a concentration (&lt;0.2 mg m-3). The signal-to-noise ratio of the 



32 

photo-physiological derived data were extremely low at the surface with both Fv/Fm and 

?PSII values presented high coefficient of variation among fluorescence profiles of 

individual samples (Figure 13). This led to the exclusion of the majority of the surface 

samples by the quality control criteria applied (see methods). Low chlorophyll-a 

concentrations were also observed in other sectors; however, the community 

composition was likely responsible for the noisy photo-physiological data at the surface 

of the subtropical gyre.  

 
Figure 13. Relationship between the coefficient of variation among replicates of Fv/Fm and 

Sigma measurements and chlorophyll-a concentration separated by sector and depth layers 

(surface and DCM).  

 

The highest Fv/Fmvalues were observed at the western side of the sector, while 

?PSII was consistent low across the DCM. Fv/Fm was positively related to the 

temperature and salinity (r²=0.53 and 0.65, respectively), but the relationship (not 

shown) was linear above 18°C and salinity above 36, suggesting that the community 



33 

with better photosynthetic performance is influenced by the Brazil-Current waters at the 

western portion of this transect. This sector has also presented the highest proportions of 

DV-Chl at DCM, the diagnostic pigment of Prochlorococcus (Figure 5). 

 
Figure 14. Vertical section of chlorophyll-a concentration across the Subtropical Gyre in the 

South Atlantic Ocean 

 

In our dataset, the chlorophyll-a concentration computed from the two methods, 

fluorimetric (Chl-a [fluorometry]) and HPLC (Chl-a [HPLC]), were highly correlated (see 

methods), however 6% of the samples presented differences higher than 40% (Figure 

15), and 6 samples presented differences higher than two-fold. These results were 

indicated in the text and their interpretation should be careful. Nonetheless, differences 

were found on the correlations analyses between pigments and photo-physiology 

parameters depending on the method (Tables 2 and 3).

3.2. Fv/Fm versus ?PSII in large spatial scales 

Fv/Fmand ?PSII were not significantly correlated when the data from all sectors 

were polled together, however some trends were observed according to distinct depth 

layers, especially in the large transects, where high vertical resolution data were 

collected (35°S and Gyre) (Figure 16). Contrasting these two sectors, ?PSII presented a 

narrower range of variability at the Gyre sector and a clear trend of correlation between 

Fv/Fm and ?PSII in deeper waters. Indeed, at DCM, they were positively correlated in this 

sector (r2=0.37, p&lt;0.01), which is opposite to what it has been previously seen (Moore 

et al. 2005, Suggett et al. 2009). However, at DCM, the Chl-b proportion (also DV-Chl) 



35 

suggested the presence of Prochlorococcus. At surface waters of the oligotrophic gyre, 

higher proportion of Zeaxanthin compared to the 35°S sector, suggests the important 

contribution of Synechococcus, that summed to the low biomass, generated the noisy 

photo-physiological data. At 35°S, Zeaxanthin and DV-Chl were lower, followed by a 

significant increase in Hex-Fucoxanthin ratios, both at surface and DCM.  

Figure 16. Relationship between ?PSII and Fv/Fm for two sectors in the Subtropical South Atlantic 

Ocean where high vertical resolution data were obtained. The data presented here are samples 

from 4 to 5 depths in the water column (not only surface and DCM). 

 

The averages of Fv/Fm and ?PSII and their respective standard deviations give a 

summary of how these two parameters vary and relate to one another among sectors, 

also showing their dynamic ranges (Figure 17). The La Plata and Benguela sectors 

presented similar ranges Fv/Fm, but ?PSII was higher for the Benguela sector in both 

surface and DCM. According with the pigment ratios (Figure 5), the La Plata sector 

showed important contribution of Fucoxanthin (i.e., marker of diatoms) near coast, 

while the stations near coast in the Benguela sector presented important contributions of 

the combination Fucoxanthin, Hex-Fucoxanthin and But-Fucoxanthin, that are marker 

pigments of diatoms and haptophytes.

layers. 

 

3.3. Relationships between photo-physiological parameters and pigment ratios and 

between photo-physiological parameters and bulk bio-optical indices across different 

oceanographic features 

Our approach was to investigate to what extent the accessory pigments can 

explain the variability observed in the photo-physiological parameters Fv/Fm and ?PSII in 

large scale. The pigments ratios to the total of accessory pigments were correlated to the 

photo-physiology parameters, including the primary and the auxiliary set of pigments 

(e.g., Violaxanthin and Neoxanthin). In our dataset, the proportion of the diagnostic 



37 

pigments (Fucoxanthin, But-Fucoxanthin, Hex-Fucoxanthin, Peridin, Alloxanthin, Chl-

b and Zeaxanthin) to the total of accessory pigments was about 70% (except for the 

Subtropical Gyre sector that was about 75%), so the other 30% of “non-diagnostic” 

pigments were considered in the analyses. 

The pigments ratios that showed relationships with Fv/Fm and ?PSII varied 

among the sectors, with important contribution of some photo-protective pigments, 

besides the exclusive diagnostic pigments. Individual photo-protective and 

photosynthetic pigments have shown important correlations to Fv/Fm and ?PSII, but in 

some cases, the commonly used physiological indices, PSC and PPC, were not 

significantly correlated to photo-physiology. For example, at DCM of the 35°S sector, 

the proportions of Alloxanthin, Diatoxanthin and Diadinoxanthin were significantly 

related to Fv/Fm, however the pool of photo-protective carotenoids (PPC) was not 

significant. 

In the La Plata sector, Fv/Fm was positively correlated to Chl c3 at the surface 

and negatively correlated to Diadinoxanthin and, in less extent, to the proportion of 

Violaxanthin (Table 2). In this case, PPC was also significantly correlated to Fv/Fm at the 

surface (r²=0.87). At DCM, Fv/Fm was correlated with the chlorophyll-a concentration. 

Although the higher values of Fv/Fm was related to higher phytoplankton biomass and 

lower ?PSII at DCM, which suggested the presence of diatoms, the proportion of 

Fucoxanthin, a diagnostic pigment of this group, was not significantly related to Fv/Fm. 

?PSII was correlated to Fucoxanthin ratios at DCM, as well as the photo-protective 

carotenoids Alloxanthin and Lutein. At the surface, ?PSII was negatively correlated to 

Chl c2 and positively correlated to ??-Carotene ratios (Table 3).

At 35°S, the dynamic range of Fv/Fm was low and it was not related to the 

biomass and diagnostic pigments. However, photo-protective pigments have shown an 

important role on Fv/Fm variability in both layers (Table 2). The packaging index S(f) 

was also correlated to the both photo-physiological parameters, and the best descriptor 

of Fv/Fm at DCM. In addition, Fv/Fm was negatively correlated to the proportion of 

degradation product of chlorophyll (Chlide/TChl-a). ?PSII, on the other hand, was 

primarily explained by the variability of Fucoxanthin, a diagnostic pigment of diatoms, 

and in less extent by Hex-Fucoxanthin and Lutein (Table 3). At DCM, the proportion of 

Chl c2 and c3 were also correlated to ?PSII. As Fucoxanthin and the accessory 

chlorophylls presented a positive impact on ?PSII, and Hex-Fucoxanthin and Lutein 

show the opposite, the direct effect of the taxonomic groups on ?PSII at this sector is not 

clear. In addition, the Fucoxanthin is a diagnostic pigment of diatoms, however is not 

exclusive, being present in several other groups. Much of the variability could be 

explained by the community size, however S(f) shows that higher ?PSII would be related 

to larger cells, which is opposed to what is expected (Giannini and Ciotti 2016). The 

relationship between Fv/Fmand Chlide/TChla suggests the presence of senescent cells 

between 10 and 20°W at this sector, where an increase in biomass was observed. 

Vertical sections of Fucoxanthin ratios and the FlowCam data from the surface (not 

shown) suggested that this community would be dominated by large diatoms. 

The photo-physiology data at the Benguela sector were influenced by the 

pigments composition only at DCM. Fv/Fm was negatively and positively correlated to 

the photosynthetic pigments Mg-DVP and Fucoxanthin, respectively, while ?PSII was 

negatively correlated to S(f). The Mg-DVP is an accessory pigment present in most of 



40 

the phytoplankton groups, usually with small contribution, however important in the 

green algae of the group Prasinophyte. 

In the subtropical oligotrophic gyre, complex relationships between photo-

physiology and pigments proportion were observed at DCM. As mentioned before, this 

sector had a greater contribution of Prochlorococcus and the proportion of DV-Chla 

and Chl-b, as well as the fraction of picoplankton (Uitz et al. 2006) were significantly 

correlated to Fv/Fm, suggesting a positive contribution of this group to the 

photochemical efficiency of the community, especially in the western basin. An 

important contribution of ??-Carotene in Fv/Fm variability was observed. In addition, 

lower Fv/Fm values are driven by the presence of Chl c2, Hex-Fucoxanthin, Peridin and 

Lutein, which was expressed by the negative impact of PSC in Fv/Fm (Table 2). 

Therefore, a mixed phytoplankton community seemed to be related to the lower 

photochemical efficiency at the eastern basin of the gyre. ?PSII was negatively correlated 

to the proportions of Zeaxanthin and Lutein (Table 3), suggesting this parameter is 

mainly controlled by the presence of Synechococcus.  

4. Discussion 

4.1. The role of pigments ratios in the phytoplankton community photo-physiology in 

large-scale process  

The amount of information about photo-physiological parameters of natural 

phytoplankton derived from chlorophyll-a fluorescence at large spatial scale has 

increased in the last decade. A number of studies include observations derived from 

different oceanographic conditions: phytoplankton blooms (Moore et al. 2005; Suggett 

et al. 2006); mesoscale eddies (Bibby et al. 2008); Southern Ocean waters (Holeton et 

al. 2005; Suggett et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2016); tropical and subtropical Pacific and 

Atlantic waters (e.g. Behrenfeld et al. 2006; Moore et al. 2008; Browning et al. 2014, 



41 

Lin et al. 2016); shelf and coastal waters (Moore et al. 2006; Suggett et al. 2009). The 

variability found in these results encourages the search for patterns and for better 

interpretations of photo-physiology. 

The studies above have discussed the influence of environmental variables and 

phytoplankton community structure in Fv/Fm and ?PSII. These parameters, especially 

Fv/Fm, have historically described physiological stress driven by nutrient limitation 

(Cleveland and Perry 1987; Kolber et al. 1988; Geider et al. 1993, Behrenfeld 2006), 

however, other studies showed that natural communities are able to acclimate to 

nutrients-limitation conditions  (Parkhill et al. 2001) making the response of photo-

physiology more significantly related to phytoplankton taxonomy and dominant cell 

size (Moore et al. 2008, Suggett et al. 2009; Chapter 3 - now published as Giannini and 

Ciotti 2016), that at first order varies according with the dynamics of a given 

environment (Cullen et al. 2002). Although phytoplankton community structure is 

expected to drive the variability of both Fv/Fm and ?PSII, and also the relationship 

between each other at least for eukaryotes, the data of the present work show no 

consistency across large-scale oceanographic regions. 

The photo-physiology of phytoplankton in the South Atlantic Ocean is still 

poorly studied. Recently, Browing et al. (2014) in the mid-austral summer sampled a 

line of stations in 40°S latitude across the Subtropical Front, demonstrating that the 

variability of phytoplankton physiology was controlled by nutrients dynamics, which 

suggested limitation by iron in the eastern basin (south of the subtropical front), and by 

the balanced macronutrient-limited growth in the western basin (north of the 

convergence). The authors found unexpected relationships between Fv/Fm and the 

fractional contribution of some individual diagnostic pigments, such as Hex-

Fucoxanthin and Zeaxanthin. The present study was conducted also in the mid-austral 



42 

summer along the 35°S and subtropical gyre, and the results showed robust 

relationships among photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and ?PSII) and a series of 

individual pigments ratios, assuming linearity (?=0.05). Fv/Fm vertical profile across the 

eastern basin of the transect at 35°S was similar to the distribution and magnitudes 

found by Browing et al. (2014). 

The comparison between the three zonal sectors in the present study reveals a 

greater influence of individual photo-protective carotenoids in the variability of Fv/Fm at 

the 35°S latitude, while the relationship with the PPC index was not significant in this 

sector. The significant pigment ratios were mainly those involved in the epoxide cycle 

(Violaxanthin, Diatoxanthin, Diadinoxanthin) that varies enormously according to the 

previous light history of the algae (Lohr 2011). The physical processes along this sector 

promote vertical instabilities driven by eddies, which may bring nutrients to the 

euphotic zone but expose the phytoplankton community to higher light levels, 

explaining the importance of some photo-protective pigments in Fv/Fm. In the 

Subtropical Gyre, the main driver of Fv/Fmvariability were the photosynthetic pigments, 

some of them diagnostic of specific taxonomical groups. In this sector, different from 

the 35°S, the water column was stratified and the chlorophyll-a concentration was 

confined at the DCM, with very low biomass along the euphotic layer. Interestingly, the 

variability of the functional absorption cross-section at 35°W was mainly driven by a 

mixture of photosynthetic and photo-protective pigments (some of them diagnostic of 

specific groups), while at the DCM of the gyre, the significant pigments were not 

photosynthetic. 

Differences between surface and deep chlorophyll maximum layers must be 

investigated with caution, since light and nutrients acclimation processes take place at 

the DCM, depending on the nitracline depth and euphotic depth (see Cullen et al. 2015 



43 

and references therein). The variability of chlorophyll-a concentration with depth do not 

always represent variability in biomass or carbon content, due to the photo-acclimation 

processes and differences in nutrients availability (Cullen 1982). Pigment ratios, 

however, can be helpful to understand the differences in photo-physiology at surface 

and at the DCM.  Across the 35°S sector, where it is possible to contrast surface and 

DCM layers in large vertical and horizontal scale, the influence of photoprotective 

pigments on Fv/Fm was similar at the surface and DCM, except for the contribution of 

Chl c3 ratios at DCM, however less significant, and the importance of Chlide/TChla and 

S(f). Chl c2 and c3 appeared as important pigments to explain ?PSII variability, which can 

be related to specific groups, although we believe the presence of Chl c, in general, can 

be also related to degradation products, as well as the Chlide/TChla (Jeffrey et al. 1984), 

which will be discussed later.  

The La Plata sector presented the expected relationship between taxonomy and 

cell size and the phytoplankton photo-physiology (Suggett et al. 2009):  high 

chlorophyll-a concentrations and diagnostic pigments for diatoms, with higher 

photosynthetic efficiency and lower ?PSII, were observed in low salinity waters; along 

the gradient of salinity, chlorophyll-a decreased, as did the photosynthetic efficiency, 

while ?PSII increased. We expected to observe this same pattern in the Benguela sector, 

since costal upwelling would drive higher phytoplankton biomass and force community 

structure gradients from coast to open ocean as reported in previous studies (Fishwick et 

al. 2006, Lamont et al. 2014). However, the influence of the Benguela current upwelling 

appeared weak in our dataset (see Silio-Calzada et al. 2008).  

4.2. The contribution of Prochlorococcus to photophysiology in the subtropical 

oligotrophic gyre 



44 

 The distribution of photosynthetic pigments at the Subtropical Gyre sector was 

related to the contribution of Prochlorococcus at the DCM of this transect, which is 

likely responsible for higher photosynthetic performance at this layer, contrasting with 

the lower photochemical efficiency of the flagellates from the group haptophytes.  

Some of its photosynthetic properties may give Prochlorococcus a definite selective 

advantage for growth at depth in oligotrophic areas, particularly compared to 

Synechococcus (Partenski et al 1999). Here we have shown a better photosynthetic 

performance of this group at DCM compared to the small haptophytes cells, that were 

identified by the HPLC analysis. The presence of Prochlorococcus and Haptophytes 

were also observed by Araujo (2015), that sampled this longitudinal transect at the same 

period. The authors also confirmed the presence of Synechococcus, besides the 

Prochlorococcus at the surface.  

Prochlorococcus is the dominant group in the tropical and subtropical oceans, 

being part of the most abundant marine picocyanobacteria groups in the worlds ocean, 

and are important contributors to the global primary production and carbon cycle 

(Partenski et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2012). Although currently reconized as a single type 

species (Prochlorococcus marinus; Chisholm et al. 1992; Guiry and Guiry 2016), to 

date, at least 11 Prochlorococcus lineages have been identified, among them clades 

adapted to high and low light (Huang et al. 2012). These authors suggested that low-

light adapted genotypes could be more diverse than high-light adapted ones. Recent 

biochemical studies suggest that different Prochlorococcus strains may have different 

antenna systems specifically adapted to the light environment from which they have 

been isolated (Partenski et al. 1997). As far as we know there is no specific studies about 

the differences in the photochemical efficiency of PSII and the effective cross-section of 

light absorption for distinct ecotypes in natural environments, for both Prochlorococcus 



45 

and Synechococcus, and it is reasonable to suggest that different ecotypes or genotypes 

might have contrasting photosynthetic performances across large spatial scale in the 

global oceans, being a subject that deserves further studies.  

The higher efficiency of Prochlorococcus has been discussed, and they were 

shown to have high values of Fv/Fm and low ?PSII, following the relationships observed 

for eukaryotes (Suggett et al. 2009). Compared to other cyanobacteria groups, the 

Prochlorococcus have low amount of phycoerythrin acting as photosynthetic pigment 

(Steglich et al. 2003), as well as 3-times lower RCI:RCII (Partenski et al. 1997), which 

lead to the photo-physiology to behave similarly to the eukaryotes groups. Also, 

Prochlorococcus appears highly adapted for growth in a nutrient impoverished 

environment (see discussion in Moore et al. 2008). There is, however, scarce 

information on photophysiological properties of DV-Chls and 

Prochlorococcus phycoerythrin (Steglich et al. 2003). Thus, our dataset contributes for 

the interpretation of large-scale variability and characteristics of the photo-physiology 

of this group that is still undersampled.  

4.3. Senescence diatoms after a mesoscale upwelling and their photophysiology 

The importance of photo-protective pigments at 35°S were observed at both 

surface and DCM, but the ratio Chlide/TChl-a was inversely correlated to Fv/Fm at 

DCM. Indeed, vertical profiles have shown this index of degradation products have 

increased between 10 and 20°W, coincident with the higher biomass at the center of the 

eddy, elevated proportions of Fucoxanthin and lower Fv/Fm values. The same increase in 

Fucoxanthin at this portion of the sector was also observed by Browing et al. (2014) that 

sampled the same region two months later. The decrease in photosynthetic efficiency 

could then be related to the presence of senescent diatoms, suggested by the presence of 

chlorophyllide-a derived from chlorophyllase activity (Jeffrey 1974). That implies a 



46 

rapid process of inactivity in the photosynthetic apparatus after nutrients exhaustion, 

and samples presented high chlorophyll-a (pigment-containing cells) and high ?PSII. The 

responses of both Fv/Fm and ?PSII in this region to a physiological stress resembles what 

is usually observed in batch cultures after nutrients depletion at the stationary phase 

(Kolber et al. 1988; Parkhill et al. 2001; Suggett et al. 2009). Bibby et al. (2008) have 

also observed lower Fv/Fm and higher ?PSII at the center of mesoscale eddies, although 

photo-physiological responses seem to be specific to the eddy type, location and its 

stage of development. The physiological response of Fv/Fm and ?PSII in this small 

portion of the 35°S sector, probably due to the intensity of the bloom, seemed to happen 

in shorter time scale than compared to a taxonomic effect. A senescent community of 

diatoms in this region could explain the observed negative relationship between ?PSII 

and the S(f) index, which is opposite to what is expected: large cells are expected to have 

lower ?PSII, as well as lower S(f). Here, lower S(f) values (i.e. low absorption efficiency) 

was associated to higher ?PSII and lower Fv/Fm. Although trends with cell size are clear 

(Ciotti et al. 2002), pigment packaging and concentration can also vary with the 

physiological state of the community, and might affect such expected relationship.  

There are few studies showing direct effects of senescent communities on the 

photosynthetic efficiency as measured by the PSII fluorescence. Franklin et al. (2009) 

have shown that the PSII efficiency declines non-linearly with the increase in the 

proportion of heat-killed cells in a laboratory experiment. Veldhuis et al. (2001) also 

observed a decrease in photosynthetic activity of different laboratory-grown species 

with the decrease in cells viability just prior to full cell degradation and, according to 

these authors, the fact that non-viable cells still possess their photopigments allows clear 

identification in mixed communities, which could be used in field research. Our results 

corroborate such idea in the sense that senescent communities originated from 



47 

environmental stress, in this case nutrients exhaustion, are photosynthetically inactive 

but have pigment-containing cells, which can be observed by the chlorophyll-a profile 

at this section. Interestingly, the longitudinal profile at 40°S from Browing et al. (2014) 

shows relatively high density of total heterotrophic bacteria between 10 and 20°W 

sampled two months later than our sampling, which might suggest an intense 

consumption of the degradation products and dissolved excreted material.  

In summary, the relationships discussed here aim to identify trends between 

pigment ratios and photo-physiology in order to assess the impacts of phytoplankton 

communities and photo-acclimation processes simultaneously on photosynthetic and 

absorption efficiencies at different large scale oceanographic regions. Although the 

chosen linear correlations resulted in low coefficients of determination, the existence of 

significant correlations are considered important results for the objectives of the study, 

that did not aim to construct predictive models. Such low predictive power can be 

related to non-linearity of relationships and the short dynamic ranges of photo-

physiological data in some of the sectors studied here, e.g. in the oligotrophic gyre.  

Some of the pigments that are considered as tertiary pigments in HPLC 

analysis and round-robin intercalibrations, such as the Violaxanthin, Prasinoxanthin and 

Lutein (Van Heukelen and Hooker 2011), presented their proportions significantly 

important and related to photo-physiological parameters in our study. Tertiary pigments 

are not among the most commonly measured pigments, however we show they might be 

important to help explaining some patterns in photo-physiology of natural 

phytoplankton communities exposed to contrasting environmental conditions.  

As phytoplankton pigments composition provides a useful information on 

taxonomy, but also physiological state and, as shown here, photochemical and light 

absorption efficiencies, it can be a powerful tool to directly monitor potential primary 



48 

production in large-scale and improve future parameterizations. As the signature of 

dominant cell size is also clear in previous work and through some indexes presented 

here, the pigments composition from different cell size classes would significantly 

contribute to the assessment of primary production dynamics in the ocean, using a more 

direct and non-invasive method, such as the chlorophyll-a fluorescence technique.

CHAPTER 3 

 

Parameterization of natural phytoplankton photo-physiology: Effects of cell size 

and nutrient concentration 

1. Introduction 

Measuring carbon primary production in the ocean is extremely challenging due 

to constraints that range from methodological issues, especially those associated with 

sample incubation (Bender et al. 1987; Grande et al. 1989; Marra 2002) and 

uncertainties in respiration and other metabolic rates (Bender et al. 1999; Williams et al. 

2002), which can limit primary production measurements in large spatial and temporal 

scales. Consequently, non-invasive methods for measuring primary production in the 

oceans have been proposed and become increasingly popular among oceanographers, 

based on the flow of electrons through photosystem II (PSII) that can be measured by 

active fluorescence emitted from chlorophyll-a (Falkowski et al. 1986; Kolber and 

Falkowski 1993).  

Active fluorometers are able to yield values of electron transfer rates (ETR) 

occurring during the photosynthetic process (Kolber and Falkowski 1993; Suggett et al. 

2003; Oxborough et al. 2012) that can subsequently be converted into an estimate of 

carbon uptake (e.g. Lawrenz et al. 2013). Computation of ETR requires specific 

parameters obtained from fluorimetric measurements, including the PSII photochemical 

efficiency (?PSII), under low and regulated actinic light, and the functional absorption 

cross-section of PSII (?PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). Active fluorescence yields 

from dark-acclimated samples, or under low light conditions, typically provide the 

maximal photochemical efficiency (?PSII
max or Fv/Fm), while the effective 

photochemical efficiency (?PSII? or Fq?/Fm?) is measured under regulated actinic light. 



50 

Such fluorescence techniques have been widely used and improved in the last years 

(e.g. Oxborough et al. 2012), providing measurements of photochemical parameters at 

different temporal and spatial scales, and are thus a promising technique to better 

examine primary production in aquatic environments. 

Photo-physiological parameters such as Fv/Fm and ?PSII are used to evaluate the 

photosynthetic performance of different phytoplankton species and their growth 

conditions, but also reflect the environmental history and responses of selective pressure 

of evolution (Suggett et al. 2009a). It is therefore fundamental to understand the 

variability of such parameters in the ocean and how they relate to environmental 

conditions and the phytoplankton community distribution and, consequently, how they 

impact on primary production estimates of marine ecosystems. In natural communities, 

phytoplankton photosynthetic rates vary in response to physical forcing acting over a 

wide range of temporal and spatial scales. As ambient nutrient availability plays an 

essential role in Fv/Fm and ?PSII variability, their relationships have been studied 

extensively (e.g. Behrenfeld et al. 2006; Bibby et al. 2008; Rattan et al. 2012). During 

nutrient limitation, phytoplankton cells typically exhibit an increased ?PSII and 

concurrent decrease in Fv/Fm, arising from a loss of functional PSII reaction centers 

relative to the proportion of antenna complexes (Greene et al. 1992; Suggett et al. 

2009a). However, laboratory experiments exposing cells to prolonged nutrient 

limitation, demonstrate that these impacts can be minimized via acclimation and 

maintenance of balanced growth (Parkhill et al. 2001); thus in natural conditions where 

nutrient limitation persists (e.g. Moore et al. 2013) physiological effects of nutrient-

limitation are not as strong as taxonomic differences (Suggett et al. 2009a). Conversely, 

such trends may not be clear where cells may be episodically subjected to periods of 



51 

nutrient limitation, transient nutrient exposure and nutrient starvation, resulting in 

persistent unbalanced growth (Rattan et al. 2012).  

Besides the impacts of environmental condition on both Fv/Fm and ?PSII, several 

studies have demonstrated the influence of phytoplankton cell size and taxonomy on 

measurements of variable fluorescence, and hence on their photosynthetic rates (Suggett 

et al. 2004; Suggett et al. 2009b; Rattan et al. 2012; Moore et al. 2005). Specifically, 

whilst lower Fv/Fm and increased ?PSII occurs via nutrient starvation, the same response 

also occurs via taxonomic changes under nutrient limitation: the small cells that are 

favored in low-nutrient environments exhibit lower Fv/Fm and higher ?PSII values than 

larger cells (Fishwick et al. 2006; Suggett et al. 2009a). Variability of pigment 

concentration inside the cell appears to govern this trend (Suggett et al. 2004, 2009a; 

Moore et al. 2005; Blache et al. 2011). Therefore, influence of dominant cell size on the 

light absorption properties is a key factor (Ciotti et al. 2002, Uitz et al. 2008), such that 

community structure-driven changes in light harvesting likely plays a major role in 

influencing the maximum achievable ETR and carbon assimilation rates. 

Despite the community structure influence on photo-physiology, choosing 

representative taxonomic-specific parameterizations of primary production models is an 

extremely difficult task, especially in coastal waters, where local hydrodynamics can 

lead to changes in the composition of phytoplankton communities on a time scale of 

hours to days. As an alternative to taxonomic-specific classification, natural 

communities can be classified into discrete groups according to dominant cell size 

(sensu Sieburth et al. 1978), still reflecting key environmental conditions, such as 

nutrient variability (Cullen 2002). Indeed, the relationship between cell size, photo-

physiology and metabolism has been widely examined in the last few years (Suggett et 

al. 2009a; Lopez-Sandoval et al. 2014; Marañon et al. 2015). Therefore, understanding 



52 

the impacts of dominant cell size upon photo-physiology and ETR, and their subsequent 

conversion to estimates of carbon assimilation, is an essential step towards improving 

primary production models derived from active fluorometry. 

 The main goal of this study was to examine for the first time the relationship 

between the dominant size of natural phytoplankton communities and variability of 

photo-physiological parameters, i.e. Fv/Fm and ?PSII, considering different ambient 

nutrients conditions. The study area included two sites of contrasting nutrient 

availability in a meso-oligotrophic coastal region in southeastern Brazil: a small and 

shallow bay and the adjacent deeper and advective channel (Figure 1) that were sampled 

on scales of days and months. As the bay exchanges water with the channel due to the 

tidal cycle, and nutrient concentration is consistently higher in the bay, the sampling 

design allowed discrimination of the effects of different levels of nutrient availability 

from cell size on the parameterization of fluorimetric photo-physiology. 

2. Theoretical background 

For a given phytoplankton cell, the relationship between fluorescence and 

photosynthesis rates can be developed as function of the relative efficiencies between 

these processes at PSII. Kolber and Falkowski (1993) proposed a model that associates 

the active PSII fluorescence emitted by samples containing live cells with the first step 

of electron transfer during the photosynthetic process. Measurements of electron 

transfer rates at PSII (ETRPSII) allow the estimation of carbon uptake rates by 

phytoplankton (Pc) according to: 

Pc = ETRPSII ? ?e ? PQ
?1  ,                                                    (1) 

where?e is the ratio of electrons transferred per O2 molecule produced during 

photosynthesis (mol O2 (mol electron)
-1) and PQ (photosynthetic quotient) is the ratio 

between produced O2 and fixed CO2 (mol O2 (mol C)
-1). ETRPSII is a function of photo-



53 

physiological parameters, i.e., the effective light absorption (?PSII) and the 

photochemical efficiency of PSII (?PSII), and it is given by: 

ETRPSII =  ?PSII ? ?PSII ? E ? ?RC       ,                                                    (2) 

where ?PSII is dimensionless, ?PSII is given in m
2(RCII)-1 and E is the available 

irradiance (mol photons m-2 s-1). Both ?PSII and ?PSII can be directly measured from 

responses in active fluorescence (Kolber and Falkowski 1993; Kromkamp and Forster 

2003). ?RC represents the quantum yield of electron transfer within the reaction center, 

which is constant and assumed to be unity (i.e. one electron is transferred per quanta 

absorbed and delivered to the reaction center). The fluorometer used in this study 

delivers excitation centered at 452nm, with a 30nm bandwidth, therefore the term ?PSII 

is replaced by ?PSII(452) hereafter. 

In order to compute ETRPSII light-response curves, as equivalent to a 

photosynthesis-light curve (Jassby and Platt, 1976), ?PSII is measured across a gradient 

of light steps (?PSII? or Fq?/Fm?), after a dark-step (?PSII
max or Fv/Fm), which also 

provides ?PSII(452) for both conditions. However, measurements of ?PSII(452) can be 

extremely noisy under high actinic light conditions (see Oxborough et al. 2012), which 

indeed we observed in our dataset; and we therefore used an alternative ETRPSII model 

that employs ?PSII(452) measured on dark-acclimated samples (Suggett et al. 2010). As 

such ETRPSII at each light step of light-response curves were computed as follows: 

ETRPSII = ?PSII(452) ?
???/???

??/??
?  E                                                        (3) 

The maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was obtained after at least 20 

minutes of dark-acclimation of the samples, in order to relax the energy-dependent non-

photochemical quenching (i.e. the dissipation of absorbed excitation energy as heat), 

while the effective photochemical efficiency (Fq?/Fm?) was measured from fluorescence 

transients obtained under actinic light and represents the product of non-photochemical 



54 

quenching and the efficiency of photochemical charge separation. ETRPSII light curves 

were computed as averages of three replicates. Details of the protocol used in this work 

to obtain the fluorescence transients and the light curves parameters are found on 

Methods section. 

Volumetric calculation of ETRPSII, i.e., in mol electron m
-3 h-1, also requires 

knowledge of number of functional reaction centers per chlorophyll-a (nPSII). Because 

direct measurements of nPSII are notoriously difficult to perform in the field, many 

studies have assumed a fixed value (nPSII=1/500; Kolber and Falkowski 1993), despite 

evidences that nPSII varies across different phytoplankton taxa and growth conditions 

(Suggett et al. 2010; Oxborough et al. 2012). Finally, the conversion of volume-based 

ETRPSII into carbon fixation estimates must also consider the “electron requirement for 

carbon fixation” (?e:c) (see Lawrenz et al. 2013) describing the efficiency with which 

electrons are invested into CO2 fixation, which is also non-linear (Ralph et al. 2010). 

3. Methods 

3.1. Study region and sampling design 

The study was conducted in the São Sebastião channel (SSC), a coastal region 

off São Paulo state in Brazil (Figure 1), where the regional hydrography is primarily 

controlled by remote winds, frontal systems and localized coastal upwelling events 

(Ciotti et al. 2014). The low year-round nutrient concentrations at SSC are modified by 

intrusions of the SACW (South Atlantic Central Water) during upwelling events off 

Ubatuba, located nearby the northern entrance of the SSC (Castro 2014), which would 

influence the primary production rates in this region via nutrient inputs (Saldanha-

Corrêa and Gianesella 2008). Nevertheless, more recent studies show that the effects of 

the SACW in the channel are limited to the deep layers (Dottori et al. 2015) and that 

episodic nutrient enrichment occurs during the passage of frontal systems (Peres, 2013).

&amp;amp; Castro, 2014). CW=Coastal Water; TW=Tropical Water; SACW=South Atlantic Central

derived from temperature and salinity indexes, according to Cerda &amp;amp; Castro (2014). The black 

arrow and the circle indicate the location of the São Sebastião Channel. 

 

Previous studies carried out in the São Sebastião channel and adjacent 

continental shelf waters have shown generally low dissolved inorganic nutrient 

concentrations, due to the water masses that flow into the channel as well as for the 

relatively low continental runoff, which characterizes this region as meso-oligotrophic 

(Saldanha-Corrêa and Gianesella 2008). Nutrient analysis has revealed low nitrate 

concentrations, resulting in N:P ratios in general below 16:1, even for the deeper waters, 

where the influence of SACW upwelling occurs during spring months (Gianesella et al. 

1999; Gaeta et al. 1999; Peres 2013, Saldanha-Corrêa 1993). Among those studies, the 

average nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations were below 10, 1 and 10 µmol/L, 



56 

respectively, where the highest values of nitrate (above 5µmol/L) were usually found at 

bottom waters of SSC during spring or summer (Gianesella et al. 1999; Peres 2013). 

In the current work, three-days sampling surveys were carried out approximately 

every month from September 2013 to August 2014. The samples were collected at two 

different sites that were visited twice a day (morning and afternoon), to give 

approximately 12 samplings per survey. One site was located in the São Sebastião 

channel (SSC), near the CEBIMar/USP oceanographic buoy (14 m depth, 

http://www.simcosta.furg.br/portal/), while the other was inside Araçá Bay (AB; 1.5 m 

depth), which is located in the continental margin of the São Sebastião channel. A 5L-

Van Dorn bottle was used to sample water from 1m depth, which was kept in dark, 

temperature-insulated bottles until laboratory processing. Three independent casts were 

performed and the samples were combined. The water collected from Araçá Bay was a 

pooled sample from three distinct points, as shown by Figure 1, in order to render a 

more representative sample of the bay. The analysis included quantification of 

chlorophyll-a concentration in distinct size fractions, determination of inorganic nutrient 

concentrations and phytoplankton photo-physiology measurements. 

Significantly higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; 

nitrate, nitrite and ammonium), phosphate and silicate were found inside the Araçá Bay 

compared to the adjacent channel (t-test; p&lt;0.02). Due to the low nutrient 

concentrations in the São Sebastião channel, we have assumed that events where N:P 

ratios (i.e. DIN:Phosphate ratios) were above the overall median are considered here as 

favorable nutrient conditions for the local phytoplankton community, which occurred 

for more than 70% of the cases inside the bay. Previously published studies do not 

allow for systematic analyses of nutrient conditions since they were episodic. The 



57 

median values chosen are, thus, based on a quality-controlled dataset available since 

June 2013. 

3.2. Phytoplankton size dominance and the community size index 

Fractionated phytoplankton biomass was estimated from four different size 

fractions of chlorophyll-a concentration, for which 250mL of water were pre-filtered 

through polycarbonate (5µm and 2µm pore sizes) or nylon (20µm pore size) membrane 

filters, and the respective filtrates were concentrated on GF/F filters (nominal pore size 

0.7µm). In addition, a non-fractionated sample was directly concentrated in a GF/F filter 

to represent the total chlorophyll-a concentration. The microplankton fraction was 

obtained from the difference between the chlorophyll-a from total and the 20µm pre-

filtered sample; the nanoplankton and ultraplankton correspond to the differences 

between the chlorophyll-a from the pre-filtered samples at 20 and 5µm and 5 and 2 µm 

filters, respectively; and finally, the picoplankton fraction resulted from the difference 

between the chlorophyll-a of the total and the pre-filtered sample through the 2µm 

membrane filter. For the 2µm pre-filtration, no vacuum was used, in order to avoid 

contamination of the samples by larger cells or detritus, and also to maintain the 

integrity of the sample, which is very fragile at this size fraction. Chlorophyll pigments 

were extracted in 5mL 90% acetone + DMSO solution (6:4 – Shoaf and Lium 1976), for 

at least 24h in dark and under -20°C, and the chlorophyll-a concentration was measured 

fluorimetrically with a calibrated Turner-Design fluorometer, through the non-

acidification method (Welschmeyer1994). A calibration factor obtained from a 

commercial chlorophyll-a standard (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to calculate the final 

chlorophyll-a concentration from triplicates of fluorescence measurements.  

Once the fractionated biomass was calculated, the dominant phytoplankton size 

was obtained from the different proportions among those size fractions, as shown in 



58 

Table 1. The dominant size categories include both dominance and co-dominance of 

size groups. The approach used here for the classification of community size dominance 

is a modification of that proposed by Ciotti et al. (2002), but including also co-

dominance of size groups. Samples that did not contain either two size fractions above 

30% or one size fraction above 40%, were classified as No Dominance (N.D.) and were 

excluded from later statistical analysis. 

Table 1. Classification of the dominant community size of phytoplankton based on four size 

fractions of chlorophyll-a concentration: microplankton (Micro: &gt;20 ?m), nanoplankton (Nano: 

5-20 ?m), ultraplankton (Ultra: 2-5 ?m) and picoplankton (Pico:&amp;lt;2 ?m). The Mean Size Index ( 

?I(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) was calculated according to Equation 4 for each dominant size group.

* The symbol “-“ represents the absence of that dominant size group in our dataset. 

** N.D. also includes samples that present only one size fraction above 30%. 

In order to assign a representative size, in µm, for each group in Table 1, we 

estimated a size index (??(???)) for each sample based on the work proposed by 

Bricaud et al. (2004). Our approach used the percentages of the four chlorophyll 

fractions in the sample and a weighting function as a size index (Equation 4). It is 

important to note that the central sizes used for each fraction is an approximation, based 

on local dataset of phytoplankton sizes (unpublished data) and can be modified if 



59 

necessary. The index was then averaged for each size dominance group ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ) of 

Table 1.  

??(???) = (%? ?  50 + %? ?  15 + %? ?  3 + %? ?  1) 100?           Equation (4) 

 The terms %M, %N, %U, %P in equation 4 are, respectively, the percentage of 

microplankton, nanoplankton, ultraplankton and picoplankton. 

3.3. Physico-chemical data  

Vertical profiles of water column temperature and salinity were obtained using 

two CTD systems (YSI Castaway CTD, YSI Inc. and AAQ-Rinko, JFE Adavantech 

Co., Ltda). Only the upper 1m data were used for the analysis, however, complete 

vertical profiles could be used to discuss and interpret the results. Sea level height was 

obtained in high resolution (30min) by an ADP (Aquadopp Profiler - Nortek -1MHz) 

deployed in a mooring system near the entrance of the Araçá bay (-23.817; -45.402).  

The concentration of inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogenous compounds 

(nitrate, nitrite and ammonia), phosphate and silicate, were quantified 

spectrophotometrically (Hatch spectrophotometer, Model DR5000), according to 

Aminot and Chaussepied (1983). Most of the samples were analyzed fresh, but in some 

cases they were filtered and then frozen until analysis. The ambient N:P ratios were also 

calculated, as the ratio of DIN to phosphate. The nitrate and nitrite concentrations were 

summed, as nitrite concentrations were consistently low throughout the analyzed period. 

3.4. Meteorological data 

Surface radiation values (W/m2) were obtained at 10-minute resolution from the 

CEBIMar/USP meteorological station (-23.823; -45.422). The radiation data provided 

by the sensor (spectral range from 400 to 1100nm) was approximated to the 

Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR: 400 to 700nm) multiplying the solar 

radiation by 45% (Kirk 1994). This conversion factor is in agreement with comparisons 



60 

made between the sensor and the PAR sensor at the CTD system used during the 

observations (factor of 41.9% - data not shown). PAR data was then converted from 

W/m2 to µmol photons m-2s-1 using the factor of 4.57 proposed by Thimijan and Heins 

(1983). The surface PAR values were averaged for two hours preceding the samplings, 

that were finally averaged for each survey in order to have a mean irradiance intensity that our 

samples were subjected to. The meteorological station also provided wind speed (m/s) and 

direction (10-minute resolution) and daily precipitation rates (mm/day), which 

complements the overview of the environmental conditions preceding each field 

sampling. 

3.5. Photo-physiology and electron transfer rate measurements 

Photo-physiological data were obtained with a Fluorescence Induction and 

Relaxation System (FIRe) bench-top fluorometer (Satlantic LLP). Measurements were 

performed using the discrete sample mode, and the results are averages of independent 

measurements performed in triplicates. Fluorescence transients were measured after a 

saturating LED pulse and an iterative fitting routine was applied to the fluorescence 

induction curves as a function of the cumulative excitation light to derive F0 (or F?), Fm 

(or Fm?) and ?PSII(452)as per Kolber et al. (1998). The data was processed using the 

Fireworx script for Matlab (Fireworx/2007, developed by A. Barnett and available at 

sourceforge.net/projects/fireworx and Matlab/2009). The parameters derived from the 

curve fitting allowed calculations of photosynthetic efficiencies in dark and light 

conditions (Fv/Fm and Fq?/Fm?). ETRPSII light response curves were derived from 

intensities spanning 0–600 ?mol photons m-2s-1 using 7 light steps. The actinic light 

source was turned on 25s before the start of the acquisitions at each light step to 

acclimate the cells to the light intensity, and dark intervals of 20s were used after each 

light step. The single turnover (STF) protocol was used with a flash length of 100?s 



61 

(blue LED) and 15 sequential repetitions, with a delay of 10s between acquisitions, to 

allow the recovery and re-opening of the closed reaction centers between repetitions, as 

the light curves are generated from static samples. The maximum rate of photosynthesis 

(ETRmax), light utilization efficiency (?ETR) and light-saturation parameter Ek (Ek = 

?ETR/ETRmax) were calculated by fitting a hyperbolic tangent model (Jassby and Platt 

1976) to the ETRPSII light curves. The FIRe was calibrated with pure chlorophyll-a 

extract (Sigma-Aldrich) and monitored monthly.  

3.6. Data analysis 

Descriptive statistics shows the variability of temperature, salinity, irradiance, 

and inorganic nutrient concentrations in monthly averages. As mentioned previously, 

this is the first dataset describing nutrients with consistent temporal resolution for this 

region, especially inside the Araçá Bay. The variability of size-fractionated chlorophyll-

a concentrations, the community size index (SI(chl)) and the community photo-

physiological parameters (Fv/Fm, ?PSII(452), ETRmax and ?) are also presented as 

monthly averages for both sampling sites. T-test analysis was used to compare means 

between both sampling sites for nutrients, chlorophyll-a concentration (total and four 

size fractions) and the photo-physiological parameters, using the software package 

Statistica v.12.  

Multivariate exploratory analyses were performed using the PRIMER (v.6) in 

order to ordinate the samples according to the environmental variables through PCA 

(principal component analysis) and nMDS (multidimensional scale) plots. Then, the 

relationship between the environmental variability and the size classes of 

phytoplankton, using the micro, nano, ultra and picoplankton proportions, was tested 

using a RELATE analysis that compares the similarity matrix between both datasets in 

order to verify if the size classes distribution is related to the ordination of 



62 

environmental parameters variability. The same procedure (RELATE analysis) was 

performed to identify relationships between the environmental variables and the photo-

physiological parameters of the phytoplankton community. 

In addition to the ordination techniques to summarize the samples distribution 

according to environmental variables and photo-physiological parameters, the 

differences between the generated grouping samples were tested thorough a 

PERMANOVA analysis. The PERMANOVA was performed to test the hypothesis that 

there is no difference between the environmental variables distribution among the 

sampling surveys, both sites and different dominant size groups ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ), also looking 

for the interaction among those three grouping factors. The resemblance matrices used 

for the multivariate analysis were based on Euclidian distance for the normalized 

environmental dataset, and Bray-Curtis similarity for the normalized data of community 

size fractions and photo-physiological variables.  

Linear regression models were used to address the effects of phytoplankton 

dominant community size on the measured photo-physiological parameters (Fv/Fm and 

?PSII(452)), following the linearity suggested by the literature (Suggett et al. 2009a). Thus, 

the photo-physiological parameters were correlated to the mean size index (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) of 

the dominant size groups proposed by Table 1. The parameters of the ETRPSII light 

curves, ETRmax and ?ETR, were also correlated to the mean size index. 

To discriminate and explore the influence of nutrients upon the observed 

relationships between community size and photo-physiology, the dataset was split into 

two different levels of nutrients. The threshold used to discriminate nutritional 

conditions was the overall median of N:P values reported for the region, based on the 

dataset available since June 2013.Thus, positive and negative anomalies around the 

median represent high and low levels of nutrients, respectively. A number of distinct 



63 

thresholds were tested (e.g., silicate, DIN) however the best predictive responses were 

obtained when N:P was used. The linear regression between size and photo-

physiological parameters were compared for both nutrients conditions using an 

ANCOVA test (SPSS software, V20). The effective photochemical efficiency (Fq?/Fm?), 

as a non-linear function of irradiance (Silsbe and Kromkamp2012) was fitted to an 

exponential model (Webb et al. 1974) and compared between the dominant size groups. 

3.7. ETRPSII primary production model parameterized by the dominant community size 

According to the influence of phytoplankton community dominant size and 

nutrients availability on the phytoplankton photo-physiological variability (?PSII(452), 

Fv/Fm and Fq?/Fm?), a parameterization of the Equation (3) was proposed in order to 

estimate ETRPSII light curves for different community dominant size. The estimation of 

primary production values as carbon uptake (Pc: mgC mgChl-a-1 h-1) from the ETRPSII 

light curves required the use of a fixed value for nPSII (=0.002; Kolber and Falkowski, 

1993), as well as a fixed ratio of the electron requirement for carbon fixation (?e:C = 8). 

The latter is an approximate ratio found for natural communities dominated by 

cyanobacteria and small flagellates (Suggett et al. 2009b), which was chosen due to the 

dominance of small cells found in our study, based on the fractionated chlorophyll-a 

concentration. 

4. Results 

4.1. Oceanographic conditions and nutrients variability  

The temperature of surface waters showed the expected seasonal pattern, 

varying from approximately 19 to 29°C, while the salinity ranged from 31 to 35 PSU, 

with no clear seasonality (Figure 2). Vertical profiles of temperature and salinity 

showed a more stratified water column during the summer surveys (data not shown). 

The variability of solar irradiance (average value of the two hours preceding each 



64 

sampling) ranged from very low values (around 60 µmol photon m-²s-1) in the morning 

samplings during winter to around 2000 µmol photon m-2s-1at noon during summer. It is 

important to note that even during winter months the irradiance can occasionally reach 

very high values in this subtropical region, such as in August 2014 (Figure 2), when the 

three-day average was 1000µmol photon m-2. 

 
Figure 2. Temperature (°C) and Salinity (PSU) (bars) of the surface waters for each sampling site 

(SSC=São Sebastião channel; AB= Araçá Bay), and the incident PAR irradiance (µmol photon 

m-2s-1; open circles) for the study region. The temperature and salinity data are averages of the 

days during the sampling surveys and the whiskers are the standard deviations. The PAR data 

were averaged for two hours preceding the sampling, which were presented here as averages for 

each sampling. 

 

The tidal cycle of São Sebastião coast is a semi-diurnal cycle with higher 

amplitudes in summer (Castro et al. 2008). During the present study, the highest tidal 

amplitude was observed in January 2014 (1.25±0.1m) while the lowest range was 

measured in May 2014 (0.78±0.06m), which was the only sampling carried out during a 

neap tide. All others samplings were performed during spring tides or during a 

transition phase. 

From August 2013 to January 2014, north-easterly and westerly-south-westerly 

winds were predominant, in general with moderate speeds. High-speed wind gusts from 



65 

the west-southwest were registered for 20% of the data from September 2013. During 

the October 2013survey, strong winds from the east occurred on the second day of the 

sampling. The surveys from February 2014 toAugust 2014 showed predominant north-

easterly winds (&gt;50%), followed by south-westerly winds (approximately 20%). Strong 

south-westerly winds were recorded before the August 2014 sampling, due to the 

passage of a frontal system. Low precipitation was registered during all surveys (up to 

~4 mm/day), except for February 2014, when the precipitation approached 65 mm/day.  

The São Sebastião channel and the adjacent waters are characterized by low 

nitrogen availability, as described above (Methods). Our dataset also shows low nutrient 

concentrations (Figure 3), specially for the inorganic nitrogenates in the São Sebastião 

channel, and in general, molar N:P ratios were low for the entire dataset, varying from 

0.23 to 9.5, with a median value of 2.23.Although still low, the N:P ratios for the Araçá 

Bay were significant higher (N:P=3.58 in the bay against 2.28 in the channel), as DIN 

and phosphate concentrations (t-test; p&lt;0.01). Silicate concentrations did not differ 

between sites (t-test; p&gt;0.05). An increase in the N:P ratios was observed in the 

September 2013 and February 2014 surveys at both sites, which coincided with the 

highest values of chlorophyll-a.  

Nitrate plus nitrite concentrations varied from 0.16 to 2.02 µmol/L in the bay 

and 0.07 to 0.57 µmol/L in the channel, while the ammonium concentrations varied 

from 0.13 to 2.13µmol/L in the bay and 0.01 to 0.62 in the channel. In general, 

maximum DIN concentrations were recordedin September 2013 in the Araçá Bay, and 

the lowest concentrations were measured in December 2013 and January 2014 in the 

channel (Figure 3a and 3b). The phosphate concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 1.0 

µmol/L in the bay and 0.09 to 0.71 µmol/L in the channel. In the Araçá Bay, thelowest 

phosphate values were recorded for January and February2014, however, the greatest 



66 

variability was observed in January, when the maximum values were also recorded 

(Figure 3c). A similar pattern was observed in the channel, except that the lowest 

phosphate concentration was observed in September2013. The silicate concentration 

ranged from 1.36 to 6.27 µmol/L in the bay and from 1.04 to 6.16 µmol/L in the 

channel (Figure 3d).

channel; AB=Araçá Bay). a. Ammonium, b. Nitrate plus Nitrite, c. Phosphate and d. Silicate 

concentrations (µmol/L). Boxes represent the mean of the three sampling days within each survey 

and the standard deviations, and whiskers are the 95% confidence intervals. Note that the y-axis 

scales are different. 

 

The multivariate PCA analysis shows the similarity among the samples 

according to environmental variables, where we could observe a clear clustering of 

different surveys varying across the temperature and salinity axis (Figure 4a). On the 

other hand, the sampling sites were clearly grouped according to variability in nutrients 

concentrations (not shown). The first two principal components explained comparable 

degrees of variability of the data, with PC1 = 36.7% and PC2 = 30%.

4.2. Distribution of the phytoplankton dominant community size  

Total chlorophyll-a concentrations were significant higher in the Araçá Bay, as 

were the &gt;5µm fraction, which includes the micro and nanoplankton(p&lt;0.01). Overall, 

the mean total chlorophyll-a in the bay was 2.49 mgm-3, and the micro- and 

nanoplankton fractions were 0.67 and 0.32 mgm-3, respectively. In SSC, the averages 

were 1.96, 0.37 and 0.18 mgm-3 for the total chlorophyll-a, microplankton and 



68 

nanoplankton, respectively. The chlorophyll-a from ultraplankton and picoplankton 

were not significantly different between the bay and the channel, with overall averages 

of 1.05 and 0.55 mgm-3 for ultra and picoplankton in the bay, respectively, and 0.88 and 

0.53 mgm-3 in the channel. Figure 5 presents the variability in the proportion of the four 

size classes of phytoplankton over time.

According to the phytoplankton dominant size (Table 1), Group 8, with the 

largest proportion of ultraplankton (&gt;40%), was the most abundant, occurring in 35.2% 

of the samples in the Araçá Bay and in 40% of the cases in the channel (Table 2). 

Samples dominated by the nanoplankton, as well as other dominance groups defined at 

Table 1, were nearly absent. Approximately 17% of the dataset did not show any 

dominance of size.

The PCA analysis of the environmental variables was also coded with the 

SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? groups (Figure 4b) with absence of grouping samples, unless a slight trend of 

larger communities being related to temperature and salinity. The multivariate RELATE 

analysis corroborated these results, which showed the ordination patterns of 

environmental variables and phytoplanktonsize classes (micro, nano, ultra and 

picoplankton fractions) were not correlated (Rho=0.14 for 999 permutations). In 

addition, the results from PERMANOVAdid not present significant differences in 

theenvironmental parameters between SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? groups (p=0.67), as opposed to the 

factors “survey” and “site” that were significant (p&lt;0.01).  

4.3. Variability in the phytoplankton community photo-physiology 

 Overall, averages of Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) in the Araçá Bay were 0.41 and 288 

Å2/photon, respectively, while in the channel they were 0.39 and 304 Å2/photon. For 

both parameters, no significant difference was observed between the sampling sites, 

with a clear co-variation throughout time (Figure 6a and 6b). However, the high 

coefficients of variation within the samplings (up to 19% for Fv/Fm and 15.3% for 



70 

?PSII(452)) highlight the large variability observed over short time scales, from hours to 

days, also clearly shown by the large errors bars (Figure 6).  

 
Figure 6. Variability of Fv/Fm (a), ?PSII(452)(Å²/quanta) (b), ETRmax (electron RCII

-1 s-1) (c) and 

?ETR (d) across the sampling surveys (mean±SE) for both study sites (SSC=São Sebastião 

Channel, AB=Araçá Bay). 

 

The ETRPSII light curve parameters (ETRmax and ?ETR) did not differ between 

sites. In general, ETRmax tended to be higher during summer (Figure 6c), while ?ETR 

values were more consistent between seasons (Figure 6d). Mean ETRmax was 191.7 and 

195.4 mol e-(molRCII)-1s-1for the Araçá Bay and São Sebastião channel, respectively, 

while the mean ?ETR values were 0.72 and 0.68. We opted to present ETRmax and ?ETR, 

from which Ek can be inferred, however, the Ek data is not presented here since the 

spectral correction to account differences between natural and actinic light sources were 

not performed.  

According to the RELATE analysis, the samples ordination of photo-

physiological data (Fv/Fmand ?PSII(452)) was not related to the environmental variables 

(Rho=0.04, for 999 permutations). Meanwhile, a nMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional 

Scaling) plot suggested a relationship between the variability of Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) and 



71 

the distribution of the SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? groups (Figure 7). ?PSII(452) was the primary factor to 

explain the clustering of the samples along the horizontal axis, being negatively 

correlated to most of the samples of the larger size groups. Secondly, there is a trend of 

larger cells being positively related to the Fv/Fm axis.

data, coded with the mean dominant size index  SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? of phytoplankton communities. 

 

4.4. Photo-physiology as a function of community size and nutrients availability  

Significant linear relationships were found between the phytoplankton size index 

(SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?) and both photo-physiological parameters. Fv/Fm showed a significant positive 

relationship with the size index of the community (r²=0.92; p=0.035), while ?PSII(452) 

presented a negative linear relationship (r²=0.99; p=0.001) with the size (Figure 8). The 

relationships were significant only when N:P ratios were higher than the overall median 

values (Figure 8b,d). Otherwise, the correlation between SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ? and the physiological 

parameters were not significant, although the determination coefficients were 0.69 and 

0.41 for Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), respectively.  



72 

 
Figure 8. Linear regressions between the mean dominant size index ( SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ) and Fv/Fm and 

?PSII(452), under N:P ratio below the overall median (a, c) and under N:P ratio above the overall 

median (b, d). Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence interval of the linear regression analyses. 

 

The ANCOVA analysis showed no significant differences between the slopes of 

the regression line derived from both sets of data, i.e., low and high N:P, with 

p(?PSII(452))=0.91 and p(Fv/Fm)=0.55. However, when N:P conditions are ignored, and all 

the data pooled in a single correlation, the regression is no longer significant. Thus, for 

the dataset analyzed here, the ambient nutrient conditions showed an important role in 

the expected relationship between cells size and Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), suggesting that 

these relationships are valid only when the phytoplankton communities are exposed to 

N:P ratios above the overall median. The parameters ETRmax, ?ETR and Ek did not 

present significant relationships when directly correlated to SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?. It is important to 



73 

point out that the relationships and parameterization proposed here apply exclusively to 

communities where there is a dominance or co-dominance of specific size fractions, as 

described in Table 1. 

For the samples where N:P is lower than the median, attempts to predict both 

Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) using the available environmental variables were performed. 

Multiple regression analysis, using Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) from individual samples (n=36) 

as dependent variable, and SI(chl) and the nutrients compounds as independent 

variables resulted in a model that included SI(chl), ammonium and phosphate as the 

predictive variables for Fv/Fm while ?PSII(452) was explained by SI(chl), ammonium and 

nitrate plus nitrite. However, the regression models explain only 28 and 30% (p&lt;0.01) 

of the variability in Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452), respectively. Due to this low prediction power 

under low-nutrients conditions and as our central goal was to quantify the influence of 

community size in the ETRPSII computation, our dataset allowed for parameterization of 

Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) only when phytoplankton communities were exposed to higher 

nutrients levels, i.e. N:P ratios above the overall median. 

 The non-linear fitting of the decrease in Fq?/Fm? as function of irradiance 

provided exponential curves that were discriminated by two different models according 

to the size groups: one with dominance of microplankton and the co-dominance of 

micro and ultraplankton (groups 1 and 3 from Table 1) and the other one dominated by 

ultraplankton alone and the co-dominance of ultra and picoplankton (groups 8 and 9 

from Table 1) (Figure 9). The error bars show that Fq?/Fm? values are significantly 

different between the two groups. The derived parameters provided two different 

models according to size. ? and Ek for communities with relative smaller cells are 0.193 

and 300.42, respectively, and 0.169 and 253.71 for the larger ones. Ek and ? values 

presented here are the adjusted model coefficients and are not used as an absolute 



74 

measurement of photosynthesis efficiency or saturation light for the community. 

Nonetheless, the non-linear fitting of Fq?/Fm?can be used as an alternative method to 

derive ? and Ek (Silsbe and Kromkamp, 2012). 

 
Figure 9. Non-linear curve fitting of effective photochemical efficiency (Fq´/Fm´) as a function 

of irradiance for two phytoplankton size groups (the larger group includes communities 

dominated by microplankton and micro+ultraplankton and the smaller group is represented by the 

dominance of ultraplankton and ultra+picoplankton). The dots represent the averages and the 

whiskers are the standard errors. 

 

We emphasize that the proposed parameterization only applies if there is a clear 

dominance of sizes in the community (refer to Table 1). For Fq?/Fm?, we could 

discriminate two size groups, however it would be interesting to have a larger dataset of 

size dominance to better discriminate the role of the intermediate size groups on this 

parameter, as Fq?/Fm? tended to be higher for group 3 (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?=20.7), when the curves 

were analyzed individually. 

4.5. Photo-physiological model for primary production estimates 

ETRPSII light curves were modeled based on the photo-physiological 

parameterization for different phytoplankton community sizes that were exposed to N:P 

ratios above the median (Figure 10a). The communities co-dominated by ultraplankton 

and microplankton reached the highest values of ETRPSII and Pc (Figure 10b), with 



75 

ETRmax= 218.2 mol e
-(molRCII)-1s-1and Pcmax = 2.59 mgC(mgChl)

-1h-1. The lower 

values of ETRPSII and Pc were observed for the microplankton-dominated community, 

where ETRmax=189.3 mol e
-(molRCII)-1s-1and Pcmax = 2.25mgC(mgChl)

-1h-1. The Pc 

values provided by the model are reasonable and consistent with the primary production 

data available in the literature for this region (Gaeta et al. 1990; Saldanha-Corrêa and 

Gianesella 2008), which is important to encourage the use of the ETR-based primary 

production measurements for large temporal and spatial resolution data acquisition for 

the São Sebastião coastal waters and other high hydrodynamic regions.

5. Discussion  

In coastal waters, physical conditions change continuously over different spatial 

and temporal scales, dynamically affecting light and nutrient availability for primary 

producers (Cullen et al. 2002). A significant fraction of ocean primary production 

occurs in coastal regions (Longhurst 2007), and hence it is critical to develop tools for 

predicting changes in natural phytoplankton community structure and in turn its impact 

on net primary production. Our study proposes a new framework for modeling primary 



76 

production from photo-physiological parameters, based on their relationships to the size 

structure of the phytoplankton community. In addition, the results show for the first 

time how these relationships are altered by the ambient nutrients conditions on a 

temporal scale of days to months in a highly hydrodynamic region. The applicability of 

phytoplankton photo-physiology and ETRPSII measurements to provide high-resolution 

primary production data was also presented.  

5.1. Oceanographic and meteorological conditions and their relationships to the 

nutrients and phytoplankton variability 

Physical processes in the oceans generally alter the availability of nutrients in 

the water column, which to a first order alters the dominant phytoplankton size structure 

and taxonomic composition (Cullen et al. 2002) and in turn manifests as altered 

photosynthetic and physiological rates (Finkel and Irwin 2000; Irwin et al. 2006) for a 

given time and place. In a very dynamic environment, such as that presented in our 

study (see also Castro et al. 2014; Cerda and Castro 2014), the relative importance of 

short-time scale physical processes, including tides and the intrusion of continental shelf 

water masses (Dottori et al. 2015), confound prediction of either nutrient concentrations 

or phytoplankton dominant sizes. During the monthly time scale of our present study, 

the two sites consistently exhibited distinct levels of nutrients whereas phytoplankton 

dominant size remained heterogeneous through time. 

The high frequency meteorological data helped to explain episodic changes in 

nutrients availability, such as the stronger W-SW winds in September/13 followed by an 

increase in DIN concentration (see also Peres 2013). This nutrient accumulation was 

observed but we cannot discount that this may have arisen from a lower consumption of 

nutrients given that irradiance was also lower for this time point. These short time scale 

processes could not be related to changes in the phytoplankton community structure, 



77 

besides our sampling design did not generally allow for this pattern to be captured 

consistently. These questions are being addressed by long-term studies, with high 

temporal resolution, initiated in the region (www.simcosta.furg.br). In general, the 

meteorological data registered low precipitation year-round and wind fields followed 

the local seasonal regime (Castro 1990; Cerda and Castro 2014). 

The Araçá Bay is extremely shallow (average 1.5m deep) and its volume of 

water is exchanged daily with SSC via the semi-diurnal tidal cycle, which reaches 

amplitudes of more than 1m during spring tides, as we observed. In the intertidal zone, 

most of the bay is covered by sand and mud, with a diverse and abundant benthic fauna 

(Amaral et al. 2010). The bay also receives two independent sources of continental 

outflows (a small river and a sewage outlet). Given that the SSC is highly advective, 

and there is a very significant increase in depth from the opening of the bay (i.e., from 

1.5 to 5 m depth in few meters), we expect phytoplankton communities from the SSC 

waters to advect to the Araçá Bay with the tides where they are then exposed to lower 

hydrodynamics (longer residence times) and significantly higher nutrient levels. Indeed, 

about 75% of the samples with N:P ratios above the overall median were observed in 

Araçá Bay, suggesting the importance of this area as a nutrient (i.e. nitrogen) source for 

the local biota. 

5.2. The photo-physiological model: effects of phytoplankton cell size and nutrients 

concentration 

The absence of co-variation between the environmental data and the community size 

structure in our dataset enabled us to pool all samples based on the phytoplankton 

dominant size, however exposed to different ambient nutrients availability. The overall 

median values of N:P was used as a threshold. It is important to note that the 

chlorophyll concentration below and above the N:P threshold were 2.18 mgm-3 and 2.8 



78 

mgm-3, respectively, highlighting that the low nutrient group is not affected by non-

detectable or noisy fluorescence signal. 

The photo-physiological parameters Fv/Fmand?PSII(452) were linearly correlated, 

positively and negatively, respectively, to the community size dominance, expressed as 

the mean size index (SI(chl)?? ?? ?? ?? ?). Although our proposed classification according to 

dominant size has never been applied for photo-physiological studies in nature, previous 

studies have shown the relationships between cell size and photo-physiological 

parameters (Moore et al. 2005; Suggett et al. 2009a; Fishwick et al. 2006). However, in 

our study, the significant relationships derived here were dependent on a threshold of 

the ambient nutrients conditions, i.e. where ambient N:P ratios were higher than the 

respective overall mean; most likely, this threshold represents the effects of high 

nutrient dynamics over time, as our dataset comprises short-term processes at temporal 

scale of hours to months, and the phytoplankton communities are not established in a 

steady-state or balanced growth. Below this threshold the community is subjected to 

nutrient starvation. Thus, we did not find the inverse relationship between ?PSII(452) and 

Fv/Fmthat would be expected based on changes in taxonomy under a continuum of 

steady state conditions alone (data compiled by Suggett et al. 2009a).  

Although our region has a consistently low nutrient concentration, the size 

dominance itself seemed to control about 90% of the variability in Fv/Fmand?PSII(452) 

when N:P was above the overall median value. Possibly, the taxonomical distribution 

co-varies with changes in size dominance under this condition, once the history of 

nutrients impacts the establishment of phytoplankton communities and responses of 

chlorophyll-a fluorescence can be the product of taxonomic adaptive processes (Suggett 

et al, 2009a).  Under nutrient starvation, none of the statistical approaches trying to 

predict the photo-physiological variability were successful.  



79 

Direct effects of nutrients limitation on Fv/Fm and ?PSII(452) have been largely 

discussed in the literature based on both natural communities and laboratorial 

experiments (Parkhill et al, 2001; Bibby et al, 2008; Suggett et al, 2009a; Rattan et al, 

2012). Nutrient depletion decreases the efficiency of PSII photosynthesis, which is 

attributed to the increase in the synthesis of light harvesting pigments relative to the 

synthesis of reactions centers proteins, which are more demanding energetically, 

increasing ?PSII(452), and consequently decreasing Fv/Fm (Kolber et al. 1988; Falkowski et 

al. 1992). On the other hand, phytoplankton communities can acclimate to nutrient-

limited conditions and achieve balanced nutrient-limited growth, e.g., to maintain their 

maximal Fv/Fm values (Parkhill et al. 2001). Additionally, nutrient-enrichment 

experiments in natural samples have demonstrated that nitrogen injections can promote 

an increase in the phytoplankton biomass without significant impacts on their 

physiological parameters, thus showing a reduced physiological response to nutrient 

additions compared with the importance of the community size structure and taxonomy 

(Moore et al, 2008). 

In our study, the taxonomic variability does not seem to impact the relationships 

between photo-physiology and dominant size under N:P ratios above the median value, 

however it can play an important role in some cases, especially for the samples under 

lower N:P. Dominance of specific groups, such as cyanobacteria for example, can 

significantly alter the relationship between size and photo-physiology, due to the limited 

PSII absorption at the blue excitation waveband used in the FIRe fluorometer (e.g., 

Suggett et al. 2009a; see also Campbell et al. 1998). Similarly, we cannot discount 

possible artifacts to our low values of Fv/Fm via chlororespiration during dark-

acclimation (Kromkamp and Foster 2003), which is an alternative electron pathway, 

where the electron carrier plastoquinone (PQ) is reduced through the respiratory activity 



80 

(Nixon 2000; Peltier and Cournac 2002). This process can increase under severe 

nutrient limitation (Behrenfeld and Kolber 1999, Mackey et al. 2008, Suggett et al. 

2010). Oligotrophic waters are usually dominated by small cells, also the most abundant 

fraction in our dataset, which could explain low Fv/Fm values found at some cases.  

5.3. Photo-physiology and primary production from active fluorometry 

The relationships between dominant sizes and photo-physiology were used to 

model ETRPSII light curves and an estimation of carbon fixation was presented. 

However, the use of chlorophyll-a fluorescence for primary production estimates should 

take into consideration a number of technical constraints associated with the 

measurements ETRPSII, as outlined previously (Suggett et al. 2009b, Huot and Babin 

2010). When comparing fluorescence techniques, it is important to consider the 

intensity and spectral quality of the actinic light and LED used for the fluorescence 

induction, as well as differences in the induction protocols, mainly the duration of 

fluorescence induction (single turnover or multiple turnover protocols). Usually, 

spectral corrections according to different light sources is required to reconcile light 

absorption coefficients across methods (MacIntyre and Cullen 2005) as well as across 

natural environments or incubations set ups in order to compare methods for primary 

production estimates (Suggett et al. 2010).  

Whilst these various corrections were not possible in our study, we have used 

constant values for ?e:C (electron requirement for carbon assimilation) from the 

literature to convert ETRPSII light curves to Pc in terms of carbon (mgCarbon mgChl
-1 h-

1), producing values of Pcmax that were comparable to those previously published via 

C14-uptake incubations technique for our region (Saldanha-Corrêa and Gianesela 2008); 

even so, we know that ?e:C varies as a function of taxa (Suggett et al. 2009b) as well as 

with different oceanographic provinces and environmental conditions (Lawrenz et al. 



81 

2013). Indeed, further measures of ?e:C are clearly warranted to verify the impacts of 

the dominant cells’ size on this ratio and how this potentially varies across the highly 

dynamic nutrient-phytoplankton conditions. In the same manner, the number of PSII 

reaction centers per chlorophyll (nPSII) proposed by Kolber and Falkowski (1993) have 

been measured on phytoplankton cultures and varied with both taxa and growth 

condition (Suggett et al. 2010). Recently, a novel approach proposed algorithms that 

derive nPSII from fluorometry data (Oxborough et al. 2012). Unfortunately, our 

methodology did not allow for the measurement or estimation of this parameter, and a 

fixed value was assumed (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). Note that if there is a consistent 

relationship between the natural community size and nPSII, the difference among the 

production curves as a function of Irradiance (Figure 10b) may not be as clear. 

In summary, the current work is the first attempt to parameterize the photo-

physiological parameters of natural phytoplankton communities derived from active 

chlorophyll-a fluorescence according to the community’s dominant size-class and the 

ambient nutrient concentration. We proposed a framework for a fluorescence-derived 

primary production model (ETRPSII-derived primary production) that can be further 

improved, through estimates of number of reactions centers and the ratio of electron 

requirement to carbon assimilation, and how they also vary with the phytoplankton 

community size structure. In addition, despite the applicability of the ETRPSII model to 

understand physical controls on primary productivity in our region of interest, this 

model can be further validated with independent datasets. This work therefore 

represents a novel contribution to the growing efforts to apply active fluorescence-based 

techniques to understand variability of primary production in marine systems, more 

specifically at high hydrodynamic coastal waters.

CHAPTER 4 

 

Direct comparisons of 14C uptake and fluorescence-derived primary production 

rates, and the role of cell size, in phytoplankton cultures of Thalassiosira sp and 

Tetraselmis sp 

1. Introduction 

During the photosynthetic chain in autotroph phytoplankton, the energy 

provided by light absorption generates the transfer of electrons that is the machinery to 

provide energy for carbon fixation. The electrons can follow a linear flow or deviates to 

complex pathways, and this flow can be used to understand the physiological state of 

the cells and the efficiency with which light energy is invested into the final organic 

carbon assimilation. Much of this energy is utilized in physiological mechanisms as 

responses to photoacclimation, nutrients limitation, temperature and other processes the 

cells can be subjected to, especially in highly dynamic environments. Accordingly, the 

electron transfer rates (ETR) does not always linearly correspond to the rate of carbon 

fixation, due to alternative electron pathways (Prasil et al. 1996; Ralph et al. 2010) and 

the efficiency with which electrons are ultimately invested into fixed carbon still needs 

better comprehension (Lawrenz et al. 2015; Hancke et al. 2015).  

ETR can be easily assayed through the emission of chlorophyll-a fluorescence 

from photosystem II (PSII) (Kolber and Falkowski 1993). One promising technique to 

assess ETR is the “Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry” (FRRf), which probes 

phytoplankton photo-physiology, specifically the emission of chlorophyll-a 

fluorescence to estimate photosynthetic electron transfer through PSII. However, a 

major weakness is that a conversion factor is required to compute the carbon uptake 

rates, termed the “electron requirement for carbon fixation” (?C, mol electrons [mol 



83 

carbon]-1; see Hancke et al. 2015), which has proven to be highly variable and difficult 

to predict. Furthermore, most of the works that computed KC values have compared 

FRRf measurements in time scale of µs with carbon uptake incubations, in time scale of 

hours, and thus reconciling those measurements can be also a source of error. Few 

works have performed simultaneous incubations to obtain KC in the same samples, 

which is a crucial methodological issue to be considered to advance towards good 

predictive models (Suggett et al. 2009b). 

Environmental conditions have already been shown to significantly influence 

observed ?Cvariability (Lawrenz et al. 2015). The authors demonstrated relationships 

between ?C and parameters including temperature, nutrient concentration, and light 

attenuation, across a large global dataset, although the significant predictor variables of 

?C distributions showed considerable spatial variability. As environmental and distinct 

nutritional conditions in the water will impose variations in the taxonomic structure of 

the phytoplankton in natural waters, assessing inter- and intraspecific plasticity in ?C is 

also necessary to fully resolve the mechanisms responsible for its variability (Suggett et 

al. 2009b; Lawrenz et al. 2015).  

Distinct taxonomic groups of phytoplankton have shown large inherent 

variability in KC for both laboratory-grown species (e.g. Fujiki et al. 2007; Suggett et al. 

2009b) and natural communities (e.g. Boyd et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2003). Natural 

communities subjected to nutrient bioassays also show that ?Ccan be influenced by both 

taxonomic and physiological adjustments, in response to alleviation of nitrogen 

limitation (Hughes et al. 2015). Taxonomic classification is, however, not a trivial 

measurement, and thus is rarely performed for natural communities, so the cell size is, 

instead, considered a good proxy for community structure and reflects environmental 

conditions (Sieburth et al. 1978; Cullen et al. 2002).  



84 

Phytoplankton cell size plays an important role in several physiological traits. 

Small cells have higher light absorption, being less affected by self-shading and 

packaging effects than larger cells (Morel and Bricaud 1981; Ciotti et al. 2002; Finkel et 

al. 2004). However, larger phytoplankton are more efficient in utilizing absorbed light 

for photochemistry (Suggett et al. 2009a; Chapter 3, now published as Giannini and 

Ciotti 2016). Pigment packaging effects also dictate the plasticity of size-dependent 

photoacclimation under changing light (Finkel et al. 2004; Álvarez et al. 2016). Several 

metabolic rates are also shown to vary with phytoplankton size, in which intermediate 

groups of natural communities would have fastest metabolism due to a balance in light 

absorption efficiency, nutrient diffusion and assimilation and cellular surface-to-volume 

ratios (Lopez-Sandoval 2014). Effects of cell size were also demonstrated in the light 

harvesting and PSII repair in response to fluctuating light (Key et al. 2010), as well as in 

the nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic complex biosynthesis in diatoms (Wu et al. 

2014), however in these cases taxonomic changes should be tested for consistency. All 

the size-scaling bio-optical and physiological performances already discussed in 

literature suggest that the cell size has also a significant and potentially predictable role 

on PSII light harvesting dynamics, ETRs and ultimately ?C, across a broad range of 

species. 

Because of the effect of phytoplankton size upon photo-physiology and 

metabolic rates are complex, it is hard to ultimately understand the role of cell size in 

regulating the conversion of photosynthetic energy into fixed-carbon, however we 

believe that along with other rates, ?C also presents a size-scaling pattern. The 

hypothesis of this work is that phytoplankton cells size should have a predictable and 

important influence upon ?C. The central goal was then to examine whether cell size of 

two laboratory grown phytoplankton groups influences ?C, testing the consistency 



85 

across the taxa (genus Thalassiosira sp versus Tetraselmis sp) that have well-

documented differences in photosynthetic physiology (Halsey et al. 2013) and are 

taxonomic groups commonly found in our region (coastal waters of southeastern 

Brazil). Photo-physiological and light harvesting properties, as well as ETR-derived 

parameters, were also compared among groups. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Cultures growth conditions and sampling design 

Four non-axenic cultures of phytoplankton were grown in the laboratory, two 

strains of diatoms (Bacillariophyta) of the same genus: Thalassiosira pseudonana and 

Thalassiosira weissflogii; and two strains of green algae (Chlorophyta): Tetraselmis sp 

(strain CS-91) and Tetraselmis sp (strain CS-352). The Tetraselmis sp strains were 

obtained from the ANACC (Australian National Algal Culture Collection) and the 

diatoms were from the Climate Change Cluster department from UTS (University of 

Technology, Sydney). As the objective was to cover significantly different cell 

volumes, the choice of species was based on differences of at least one order of 

magnitude in cell volumes of these taxonomical groups commonly found in natural 

coastal waters of southeastern Brazil. The respective cell volumes were: 131.8, 1718.3, 

300.9 and 1569.6µm3 (see Table 1).  

The cells were grown in triplicates, under 65µmol of fluorescent light with a 

blue filter, that were monitored with a LI-COR light meter on the shelf (light:dark cycle 

of 12:12 h), and kept at 20°C. Cells were grown in f/2 medium (Guillard and Ryther, 

1962), prepared with autoclaved, 0.2µm filtered seawater collected from Sydney 

Harbour (Australia), and were maintained in semi-continuous batch mode through serial 

dilutions (Wood et al. 2005) to maintain cultures in exponential phase and under 



86 

balanced growth. The cultures were acclimated to the nutrient, temperature and 

irradiance regime for at least three transfers before commencement of sampling.  

Growth rates were derived from daily measurements of in vivo fluorescence for 

all replicates during the experimental period (about 2 months). Samples for cell counts 

were collected every day during the entire experiment period, for at least one replicate, 

in order to have a ground-truth validation of the fluorescence-based growth. The growth 

rates (µ) were calculated through least-square linear regression of ln cell density over 

time, from which the growth rate is the slope of the regression fitting line (d-1). The 

validation of growth rates through cell counting have shown high correlation with the in 

vivo fluorescence (r2=0.90) for most of the growth curves, except for one replicate of T. 

pseudonana (r²=0.60).   

After acclimation and a series of dilutions during exponential growth, samples 

were collected for numerous biological and physiological analyses, such as the 

determination of chlorophyll-a and reaction center concentrations (Chl-a and RCII), 

photosynthetic unit size (PSU), cells size, biovolume and density, spectral light 

absorption (achlphy), particulate organic carbon and nitrogen contents (POC and PON) 

and photo-physiological parameters based on Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry. Lastly, 

carbon assimilation rates through 14C incubations were measured simultaneously to 

FRRf measurements (Electron Transfer Rates) to calculate the electron requirement for 

carbon fixation for the contrasting cell sizes.  

2.2. Biological measurements  

Chlorophyll-a and Reaction Center concentrations: Aliquots of the cultures 

were filtered (10 to 30mL) for chlorophyll-a determination through the non-acidification 

fluorimetric method (Welschmeyer, 1994) , for which the chlorophyll pigments were 

extracted in 5mL 90% acetone+DMSO solution (6:4 –Shoaf and Lium, 1976), for at 



87 

least 24h in dark and under -20°C. The calibration factor obtained with a chlorophyll-a 

standard was used to calculate the final chlorophyll-a concentration, and the values were 

averages of triplicates. The concentration of reaction centers (RCII) and thus the 

photosystem size unit (PSU; mol Chla/mol RCII) were derived from fluorescence 

parameters, discussed further in section 2.4. 

POC/PON. Pre-combusted GF/F filters were used to retain the particulate 

material after filtration of aliquots of 15mL of the cultures. The filters were dried 

overnight at 60°C and kept in silica gel and in the dark until subsequent analysis with a 

CHN analyzer. The organic carbon (POC) and organic nitrogen (PON) in the filters 

were quantified and volume-based quotas were calculated in µg/mL.  

Cell dimensions. Cell volume for all species was estimated from linear 

dimensions from images taken with a camera attached to a calibrated microscope 

(Nikon Automated Upright Fluorescence Microscope), using the Image-J image 

analysis software. We measured at least 60 cells by assigning different geometric shapes 

that were most similar to the real shape of each phytoplankton species (Sun and Liu, 

2003). Cylinders were used for diatoms and ellipsoids for the green algae species. 

2.3. Particulate light absorption and phytoplankton light-harvesting properties  

Phytoplankton spectral light absorption from 400 to 750nm were measured for 

samples filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters, using an optic fiber UV/VIS spectrometer 

(Ocean Optics, Florida, USA), where sample blanks were measured separately. 

Particulate absorption was calculated using the QFT method (Roessler 1998) from the 

optical density of the material after correcting for residual scattering at 750 nm. The 

optical density (ODf) obtained from phytoplankton particles retained on the filter needs 

to be corrected for the filter amplification factor (?-factor), i.e. converted to optical 

density of particles in suspension (ODs) (Cleveland and Weidemann, 1993, Roessler 



88 

1998). We have used the quadratic function proposed by Finkel and Irwin (2001) for ?-

correct both diatoms and the values estimated by Arbones et al. (1996) for Tetraselmis 

sp. The particulate light absorption (aph(?); m
-1) at wavelengths between 400 and 700nm 

was calculated from ODs using the equation 1 (Tassan and Ferrari 1995).  

??? =  
2.303 ???(?)

?/?
                                                (1) 

Where ODs(?) is the ?-corrected optical density for all wavelengths, V is the 

filtered volume (m3) and A is the clearance area of the filter (m2). The chlorophyll-a 

specific absorption coefficient (achlph; m
2(mgChl-a)-1) was obtained by normalizing the 

particulate absorption to the chlorophyll-a concentration. 

The proportion of light harvested by the phytoplankton antenna complex 

directed to the photosystem II (PSII) was analyzed after a spectral correction performed 

to weight for the different light sources used for the measurements (Suggett et al. 2003; 

2004). The effective cross-section of light absorption by the PSII was measured by 

fluorometry through excitation with a blue LED (peak wavelength of excitation at 

450nm), and compared to the light absorbed by the chlorophyll-a after spectrally 

corrected for each species (Equation 2). The chlorophyll-a specific absorption was also 

weighted to the other lights sources used here, such as the actinic light of the FastAct 

chamber used for the carbon uptake estimates the growth light.

2.4. Dark-acclimated photo-physiological state and the electron transfer rates  

Photo-physiological parameters and the electron transfer rates (ETR) were 

measured through Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf), using a FastOcean 

Fluorometer, attached to a FastAct chamber (both Chelsea Technologies, London, UK). 

Dark-acclimated measurements of Fv/Fm (maximal PSII photochemical efficiency) and 

?PSII (effective cross-section of absorption by PSII) were obtained by the FRR 



89 

fluorometer that was programmed to deliver saturating (ST: Single Turnover) flashes to 

PSII, induced by 100 flashlets at 2?s intervals from an excitation source of blue LEDs 

(peak excitation at 450nm, Fig. 2b). 

ETR steady-state light curves were performed, with at least 20 acquisitions of 

100 saturating flashlets under increments of actinic light, from 0 to 1400umol photon 

m²s¹. The actinic light steps provided ETR per cell unit volume calculated through two 

different equations: the Sigma-based algorithm (Kolber et al. 1988 – Equation 3a) and 

the Absorption-based algorithm (Oxborough et al. 2012 – Equation3b). Values of 

JVPSII (volume-based ETR) were also computed from both equations. 

ETRvolSIG = ?PSII · Fq´/Fm´ · (Fv/Fm)
-1 · E · RCIIvol                                    (3a) 

ETRvolABS= aLHII · Fq´/Fm´ · E · cell
vol                                          (3b) 

E is the irradiance (µmol photon m-2 s-1), Fq´/Fm´ is the PSII photochemical 

efficiency measured under actinic light (dimensionless) and RCIIvol is the concentration 

of functional PSII reaction centers per unit of cell volume, where RCII concentrations 

were calculated from fluorescence parameters as per Oxborough et al. (2012). Kn (the 

conversion factor used to scale fluorescence data to RCII) was cross-calibrated with the 

FastTrackaII fluorometer due to the fact the instrument was calibrated more recently 

than the FastOcean. The correction factor between the two fluorometers was x1.204. 

The same calibration factor was used to calculate aLHII in Equation 3b, which is the 

absorption coefficient for PSII light harvesting (units of m-1), calculated from dark 

FRRf data (Oxborough et al. 2012). cellvolis the unit cell volume per volume of sample. 

Blank measurements of filtered samples were below 1% of the fluorescence signal and 

therefore were not subtracted from the bulk fluorescence signal. Physiological 

parameters derived from ETR light curves, such as ETRmax (maximum rate of electron 



90 

transport), Ek (light saturation parameter) and ?ETR (light utilization efficiency) were 

calculated by fitting a hyperbolic tangent model (Jassby and Platt 1976).  

2.5. Carbon uptake rates and the electron requirement 

Samples were collected from each culture (three biological replicates) for 15 

min incubation, where the samples were spiked with radioactive 14C (activity= 

0.4µCi/ml). 3mL samples inoculated with 14C were then measured in the FRRf under 

the actinic light (66 µmol m-2s-1 – growth light condition) for a 15min incubation where 

ETR was continuously measured, in order to compare the ETR against carbon 

assimilation for the same sample (to derive Kc with minimal methodological bias). 

After incubation, samples were transferred to a scintillation vial and 14C activity was 

terminated by adding 150µl of 6M HCl. This drives-off any remaining 14C into 

dissolved CO2, which can then de-gases from the sample. After at least 24 hours, 

scintillation fluid was added to the samples which were then counted using a 

Scintillation Counter to measure disintegrations per minute (dpm) in the samples to 

calculate the 14C production in ‘mol Carbon m
-3 day-1’ as per JGOFS protocols (Knapp 

et al. 1996). Dark samples were incubated in order to exclude any dark activity of 

carbon uptake, as well as blank samples were included in the analysis to account for the 

initial activity before the incubation (T0). 

2.6. Data analysis 

Most of the bioptical and light harvesting properties, i.e. proportion of light 

absorbed and directed to PSII, and photo-physiological parameters analyzed were 

expressed in unit cell volume base, and effects of the cell sizes were tested using a 

mixed-model nested-ANOVA, in which the taxonomic group was considered as a 

random factor (since we are not interested in the taxonomic effects of these two specific 

groups into photo-physiology), that was nested within the size factor (fixed). That 



91 

allowed for testing the consistence of the size effects when different taxonomic groups 

of phytoplankton are considered. The same approach was used for the photosynthetic 

parameters derived from ETR light curves, where two different algorithms were 

compared, and for the electron requirement for carbon fixation (?C). Organic carbon 

content in the cells and the ratios to chlorophyll-a and organic nitrogen were statistically 

compared, as well as the production derived from inorganic carbon uptake (C14 uptake) 

and organic carbon increments (particulate organic carbon times growth rates). The 

coupling between the inorganic carbon uptake and conversion to organic compounds 

was also discussed. 

3. Results 

3.1. Physiological characterization at balanced growth 

A series of biological and photo-physiological measurements were performed, 

ensuring the cultures were at mid-exponential phase and balanced growth. Table 1 

presents the characterization of the species in terms of cell volume and abundance, 

chlorophyll-a concentration, photosynthetic unit size, and other parameters, as well as 

the results of the mixed-model nested-ANOVA. Dark-acclimated measurements of the 

effective cross-section of light absorption (?PSII) and the maximum photochemical 

efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) were lower and higher for the larger size cells, respectively, as 

expected (Suggett et al. 2009a). Such a response is mainly associated with the 

packaging effect of pigments that decreases the efficiency of light absorption per unit 

cell volume, due to self-shading effects (Morel and Bricaud 1981). Furthermore, the 

unit area of photosynthetic membrane space available per unit cell volume decreases as 

cell size decreases, and thus the small cells may have evolved higher ?PSII in order to 

maintain high per-unit volume light-harvesting rates (Suggett et al. 2009a). Other 

parameters, such as the growth rate (µ), the concentration of chlorophyll-a and reaction 



92 

centers per unit cell volume (Chl-avol and RCIIvol) and the PSU (photosynthetic size 

unit) were different between taxonomical groups (group(size) effects – p&lt;0.01), and the 

cell size was not the main driving factor (Table 1). Diatoms exhibited higher µ (0.76d-1 

for both groups), however a significant effect of size was observed for the Tetraselmis 

species, with higher µ for the small isolate (0.57d-1 versus 0.24d-1). The same interaction 

was observed for the Chl-avol, however Chl-avol was significantly higher for the larger 

than smaller Tetraselmis isolate, suggesting an even stronger degree of packaging for 

this specie (Figure 1b). Tetraselmis species exhibited higher values of RCIIvol than from 

diatoms (Table 1), however RCIIvol tended to be higher for the smaller cells in both 

groups (Figure 1c).

3.2. Light harvesting properties 

The chlorophyll-a specific light absorption by the phytoplankton cells were 

measured for the PAR wavelengths band (400-700nm), showing that the Tetraselmis 

species present a flattening in the absorption spectrum around the blue band (400 to 

500nm), showing lower absorption at this portion compared to the diatoms (Figure 2a). 

The spectrally averaged specific absorption (&lt;achlphy&gt;) are compared among the species 

in Table 2, that presents the light harvesting and absorption properties across the 



94 

isolates. The distinct spectral shapes of light absorption emphasize the importance of 

spectral corrections when the phytoplankton photo-physiological properties are 

measured under different light sources. Here, we have used three different light sources 

throughout our measurements and the appropriate spectral correction were applied in 

order to compare the light harvesting properties of the cells (see ratios in Table 2). The 

spectral shapes of each light source, with the respective normalized magnitudes, are 

compared in Figure 2b. The blue LED is the light source of the FastOcean (FRRf) used 

for the PSII photo-physiological measurements and the actinic light inside the FastAct 

chamber was used to perform the incubations for ETR versus Carbon uptake 

comparison. Lastly, the Figure 2b also shows the spectrum of the growth light where the 

cultures were acclimated before the experiments.

(middle panel) and the proportion of light absorbed and directed to the PSII weighted for the 

spectrum of the blue LED from FastOcean (lower panel) 

 



96 

The absorption weighted to the internal FRRf light source (?chlphy Frrf) was used 

to calculate the proportion of light that is absorbed by the PSII (achlPSII) in relation to the 

total light absorbed by the cells (Figure 2c). As triplicates of achlphy were not possible, 

the statistical analysis could not be performed, however it is clear that the small 

Tetraselmis has the largest proportion of absorbed light directed to the PSII compared to 

the other isolates. The size effect was then only clear for this group, while the difference 

seemed to be small for the diatoms. Such a trend was also observed for the PSII 

absorption per unit volume for the small Tetraselmis (avolPSII), although the difference 

amongst species was not statistically significant (Table 2). In general, the Tetraselmis 

presented higher proportion of light directed to the PSII, that corroborates to the higher 

RCII concentration per unit volume for this group (Figure 1c).

3.3. Electron transfer rates (ETR) 

ETR light curves were calculated and show that the green algae sustain higher 

ETR than the diatoms per unit cell volume (Figure 3), which minimizes the role of the 

cell size in this case. Overall, maximum ETR per unit cell volume (ETRvolmax) was 

significantly higher for the green algae (Table 3), as well as the saturation light intensity 

(Ek), which is consistent with different quenching dynamics and dissipation of excess 

light energy for this taxonomic groups (e.g. Wagner et al. 2006), regardless of cell size.  

The significant interactive effect indicates that the taxonomic group was more important 

than cells size to determine the photo-physiological differences in terms of the ETR 

parameters, such as ETRvol max, Ek and ?ETR
vol. Similar results were observed for the 

physiological parameters derived from JVPSII regarding the effects of cell size and 

taxonomical groups, except that the significance of the interaction group(size) for 

ETRmax was lower than the ETRvolmax (Table 3). The cells size did not present a 

significant and consistent role in the variability of the ETR parameters.

Table 3 compares the photo-physiological parameters derived from ETR light 

curves calculated via different equations: from Sigma (ETRvolSIG) and Absorption 

(ETRvolABS) algorithms (Oxborough et al. 2012). The new approach proposed by 

Oxborough et al. (2012) to calculate a volume-based ETR (or JVPSII) through an 

absorption-based algorithm (Eq 3b) has an advantage over the Sigma-based algorithm 

(Eq. 3a) because, once the instrument is calibrated with a direct measurement of RCII 

concentration, JVPSII can be calculated simply from dark acclimated data and the 

photochemical efficiency under actinic light. Here, we have used the same calibration 

factor to estimate RCII for both algorithms, so the differences here are based on using 

aLHII or ?PSII. The Sigma-based algorithm assumes zero connectivity between RCs (open 

RCs estimated from qP), while the absorption algorithm does not require the assumption 

of RCs connectivity type. The differences observed for ETRvol were small, however the 

absorption-based algorithm tended to compute lower ETRvol max and ?ETR
vol than the 

Sigma-based algorithm for all the species. However, it is important here that this 

difference was consistent across the species. 



99 

3.4. Electron requirement for carbon assimilation (?C) 

The differences in the Kc are presented in Figure 4, where cell size did not 

show consistent differences overall. Besides the differences among species, ?C values 

were in general close or below the theoretical expected value for Kc in optimal growth 

(4 to 6 mol e-(molC)-1; Genty et al. (1989); Suggett et al. 2009b). The large diatom 

shows the lowest ?C, followed by the small Tetraselmis, although both presented ?C 

values below 4. The mean ?Cfor the small diatom was 4.5, which is close to values 

found in the literature for both cultures (Hancke et al. 2008) and for natural 

communities dominated by diatoms, however the ?C measured for Thalassiosira 

weissflogii was lower in our study compared to previous reported values (Suggett et al. 

2009b). The explanation for the low ?C values will be discussed later, which is likely 

related to systematic methodological issues regarding both carbon fixation and ETR 

estimates (Lawrenz et al, 2015). The large Tetraselmis presented the highest electron 

requirement (KC=6.04), which suggests this species to be the least efficient in 

converting light energy into fixed carbon.

3.5. Elemental cellular composition and carbon productivity 

 The productivity was estimated from 14C uptake measurements and from 

POC and growth rates from each species. The triplicates’ averages and standard errors 

of the daily productivity are shown in Table 4, which varied from about 1 to 9 µgC mL-1 

d-1. In average, the same gradient was observed across the isolates for both 

measurements (14C uptake and POC), where the large Tetraselmis isolate was the less 

productive and the small diatom (T. pseudonana) the most productive. The comparison 

between both measurements per cell unit is presented in the Figure 5 for all the samples, 

which allows to have an overview on how inorganic carbon assimilation is used to build 

organic cellular elements against other processes that consume the assimilated carbon.

The relationship between P14C and PPOC for the small diatom shows that all the 

carbon assimilated is used to build the organic structure of the cells (fall into the 1:1 

line), while the large diatom presented the replicates varying across the 1:1 line. 

Although one of the replicates of T. weissflogii presented P14C higher than PPOC, 

suggesting other processes might be reducing the assimilated carbon inside the cells in 

this sample, in general, both diatom groups have shown the inorganic carbon 

assimilation to organic carbon ratios per cell around the central 1:1 line. For the 



101 

Tetraselmis isolates, this relationship tended to be below the 1:1 line, especially for the 

large isolate. 

Table 4 also shows the C : Chl-a and C : N ratios, with significant differences 

across taxonomical groups. The carbon to chlorophyll-a ratio tended to be higher for 

larger cells, but the interactive effect of taxonomical groups and size shows that the cell 

sizes are not the main controlling factor. The same interaction was observed for C : N 

ratios, however the smaller cells tended to have slightly higher C:N. In general, the C : 

N suggests carbon limitation in the cultures, although the balanced-growth were not 

apparently affected.

4. Discussion 

In general, the effects of cell size in the light harvesting properties analyzed 

here, as well as in the ETR-derived photosynthetic parameters and electron requirement 

for carbon fixation were taxa-dependent. As expected, the only parameters significantly 

related to cell size, regardless of taxa, were the maximal photochemical efficiency and 

the cross-section of PSII light absorption. However, all the complex interactions among 



102 

the utilization of light energy and the final carbon assimilation prevented the electron 

requirement to have a consistent effect of cell size. The same approach would be 

encouraged using other phytoplankton groups, but it is important to note the groups 

used here are common groups found in natural communities (diatoms and 

chlorophytes), which were chosen randomly, however inspired by the natural 

community composition usually associated with subtropical coastal waters. The main 

focus of this study was the direct conversion of absolute rates of electron transfer into 

carbon fixation rates and the investigation of the role of cell size in regulating this ratio. 

KC values are extremely variable, especially when including field work studies (Suggett 

et al. 2009a; Lawrenz et al. 2015; Hancke et al. 2015; Hoppe et al. 2015). Lawrenz et al. 

(2015) have shown a global average of 10.9 mol e- (mol CO2)
-1, although that were well 

discriminated when different oceanographic regimes and biogeographic regions were 

clustered. Suggett et al. 2009 have reviewed previous values of Kc across natural and 

cultures conditions, where communities dominated by diatoms presented Kc between 4 

and 12 mol e- (mol CO2)
-1, while they found cultures-based values for diatoms 

(Thalassiosira weissflogii) around 6 mol e- (mol CO2)
-1. Those studies have shown that 

in many cases, the use of an assumed value between 4 and 6 mole-(molC)-1 to ETR-

derived production will yield biased estimation of primary production (Lawrenz et al. 

2015).  

In our study, KC values were close or below the theoretical values for most of 

the species, except for the large Tetraselmis. Low electron requirement values (&amp;lt;4 mol 

e-(mol CO2)
-1) have been previously shown (Boyd et al. 1997; Corno et al. 2006; Hoppe 

et al. 2015), however it is important to carefully consider the distinct measurements 

protocols applied among studies, especially regarding the incubation time (our protocol 

allowed for gross primary production estimates) and light sources, that requires 



103 

appropriate spectral corrections. Low Kc values are difficult to reconcile and it is likely 

originated from methodological issues, as well discussed by Lawrenz et al. (2015). 

Here, we have two potential sources of uncertainties in KC estimates: i) variability and 

possible underestimation of RCII concentration and ii) non-systematic errors in the 

carbon fixation measurements. 

The RCII concentration were obtainedfrom an algorithm incorporated in the 

data processing in the FastPro (FRRf software). The algorithm is based on the dark-

acclimated fluorescence parameters and a constant that was obtained from calibration 

against an O2 flash-yield system (Oxborough et al. 2012). However, the calibration was 

performed for the FastTrackII fluorometer and thus we cross-calibrated the FastOcean 

we used against the FastTrackII to derive another calibration factor (=1.204). It is 

possible that the FastOcean underestimates RCII even after this correction, and a direct 

calibration against the O2 flash-yield system would be necessary. Similar KC values 

(from 2.7 to 6 mole-(molC-1)) were reported by Hoppe et al. (2015), in which they have 

also used a FastOcean fluorometer to investigate the interactive effects of ocean 

acidification and distinct light regimes in Antarctic diatoms. Unlike our approach, the 

authors have compared ETR to net primary production (NPP), that is lower than the 

gross primary production (GPP), once part of the inorganic carbon assimilated have 

been released by respiration after a certain period of incubation (Ryther 1956). The 

incubation time is a crucial information to be considered to differentiate NPP from GPP 

and compare KC among studies. The short incubation time used here (15min) 

approximates the measurement to the GPP. 

Another issue that probably interfered with our KC estimates is the uncertainty 

in the estimation of C uptake. The 14C assimilation method for quantifying the inorganic 

carbon fixation by the phytoplankton cells (Steemann-Nielsen 1952) utilizes the initial 



104 

inorganic carbon measured in the sample, the precise amount of 14C-labeled carbon 

added before incubation and the amount of 14C incorporated in particulate organic 

matter. After a known incubation-time, one can calculate the rate of inorganic C 

fixation. However, it is based on the assumption that the uptake of added 14C-labeled 

inorganic carbon is proportional to the uptake of unlabeled 12C carbon during the 

incubation in a closed container. Possibly, there could be a shortage of DIC (dissolved 

inorganic carbon) within the cultures medium that would result in 14C inorganic carbon 

being drawn down in a higher rate than expected, and this fast assimilation may limit 

the inorganic carbon to be fully replaced by the atmosphere equilibration. That would 

overestimate the carbon uptake during the time of the incubation, especially in such a 

short-time incubation. This hypothesis is corroborated by the C : N ratios data, that 

suggests low cellular quota of carbon, probably reflecting a DIC limitation. Although 

that is observed for all species, the balanced growth does not seem to be affected.  

Few works have performed simultaneous incubations to reconcile the electron 

transfer rates and the carbon uptake (14C uptake) in the same sample. In recent years, 

most of the work have compared instantaneous FRRf measurements (time scale of µs) 

and carbon uptake incubations (the shortest being around 1h). Thus, the timescale of the 

measurements for those comparison has been an important methodological issue 

(Suggett et al 2009b). The simultaneous incubation has the advantage of using the same 

light source for both ETR and 14C measurements (the actinic light in the FastAct 

chamber – spectrum at Fig2b), so there is no need to weight the PAR irradiance of the 

incubation lights as is usually done. Weighting the ?PSII measurement for the actinic 

light source would however lower Kc values up to 49%. We have presented Kc without 

the spectral correction of ?PSII, once the incubations were performed in the same 

incubation light for ETR and 14C fixation (EPAR=66 µmol photon m
-2s-1), with the aim to 



105 

compare the cell size effect on Kc. Table 2 shows that the weighting function factors 

among the species were similar, which would keep the same statistical results. As we 

have considerations about a possibly systematic underestimation of ETR and 

overestimation of 14C uptake, we keep the non-weighting values (LED versus actinic 

light) to avoid including extra noisy, although we are aware of its importance (Boyd et 

al. 1997; Macintyre and Cullen (2005); Suggett et al. 2003; Suggett et al. 2004). 

Although systematic errors can be associated to ETR estimates and DIC 

limitation as discussed above, we believe still other sources of uncertainties in the 14C 

uptake of the large Tetraselmis occurs. The proportion of carbon assimilation and the 

net carbon production estimated from POC data (Fig. 4) have shown low values of C-

uptake for this species in relation to the net production. It is reasonable that a non-

systematic error in the 14C uptake takes place, and underestimates of gross 

photosynthesis may occur due to isotope disequilibrium between the intracellular and 

extracellular CO2 pools (MacIntyre and Cullen 2005; Suggett et al. 2009b), and distinct 

assimilation of isotope carbon among species, that could possibly underestimate the 

carbon uptake in the large Tetraselmis.  

The slower growth rate of the large Tetraselmis compared to the others species 

used here might influence the short-term 14C uptake rates and energy allocation, as it 

has been observed to occur in diatoms under nutrient limitation, but could be present in 

other taxa (Halsey et al. 2010). In addition, the light-harvesting properties of this 

species suggest special features that could be driving this complex interpretation. The 

cells are extremely pigment packed and the effective light absorption is low, however 

they reach higher electron transfer rates than the diatoms and the non-photochemical 

quenching dynamics seem to be more efficient (higher NPQ values – not shown), also 

presenting high Ek (=701.5 umol photon m-2 s-1). 



106 

In addition, it is possible that contamination by small autotrophic or bacteria 

consuming inorganic carbon during incubation have occurred, especially because one of 

our replicates was excluded due to contamination, although we could not detect it in the 

replicated we performed the experiment. Uptake of labeled 14C by heterotrophic bacteria 

and aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms may also contribute to 

uncertainties and the influence of these organisms on the measured 14C activity is yet to 

be determined (Corno et al. 2006). Underestimating 14C uptake for the large Tetraselmis 

could also explain the highest Kc found for this group (around 6), that even with a 

systematic underestimation of ETR, could still be responsible for the higher KC than the 

other species. 

Regardless of complexities in estimating absolute ETRs, Carbon uptake, and 

hence Kc, the hypothesis that the cell size has a significant effect on the electron 

transfer efficiency and the electron requirement for carbon fixation was not confirmed, 

and the taxonomic group significantly influenced the size response. It is possible that 

the size difference was not large enough to show contrasting responses, although we 

have tried to use different orders of magnitude in cell volumes. Our data suggest that 

such parameters more strongly depend on differences in the strategies of distinct 

taxonomic groups to grow and maintain their biomass (Halsey et al. 2013; 2014). 

Although similar photosynthetic efficiencies, differences in the lifestyle strategies to 

allocate photosynthetically-derived products have been observed for these two specific 

taxonomical groups (diatoms and green algae) under a range of nitrate-limited growth 

rates (Halsey et al. 2013). The differences are then related to lifetimes of newly fixed 

carbon during different phases of the cell cycle. This distinct allocation of end products 

of carbon could influence the carbon uptake in short time incubations, with the electron 

requirement reflecting such effects rather than differences in cell size, given the same 



107 

nutrients and light conditions. More important is to consider these differences for 

natural environments, although this kind of study still need to be done in laboratory. 

The effects of taxa-specific strategies towards allocation of photosynthetic 

energy and carbon increments according to growth rates can be intimately related to the 

role of the phytoplankton communities to deal with natural transient nutrients conditions 

and the maintenance of the primary production at nutrient-limited regions, where the 

enrichment may occur in different time-scales. The phytoplankton taxa used here 

(diatoms and green algae) are common organisms found in coastal subtropical waters, 

however, the use of laboratory-grown cultures, although necessary, is enormously 

biased when we try to explain photo-physiology strategies and energy utilization in 

natural environments, especially when organisms with very complex optical and 

physiological characteristics, such as the large Tetraselmis used here, are used to 

investigate patterns that seem to be clear in nature. Thus, we emphasize the need for a 

careful interpretation of phytoplankton culture data. 

In summary, whilst cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light 

absorption and photochemistry, species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy 

allocation dominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to 

carbon assimilation, i.e., in the electron requirement for carbon assimilation. As such, 

interactive effects of cell size and taxonomy in the growth strategy to maintain biomass 

and production is critical to better understand the dynamics of primary production rates 

derived from photo-physiology in natural and highly productive sites.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

 

The study presented an advanced overview of the fluorescence technique, 

proposing novel approaches that contribute to the improvement of primary production 

measurements from photo-physiology, especially in highly dynamic environments. The 

central hypothesis was that the variability in key phytoplankton characteristics, driven 

by contrasting communities that in turn are responses of environmental forcing, can be 

used to improve the parameterization of primary production models based on photo-

physiology. 

The first main question relates to the impacts of the community structure and 

their physiological responses on the fluorescence-derived photo-physiological 

parameters. In a spatial scale, the pigments composition strongly influenced the photo-

physiology of natural communities throughout vertical mesoscale processes, once it 

represents the combined effects of phytoplankton biomass, taxonomy and acclimation 

processes, however highlighting for the contribution of photoacclimation-related 

pigments compared to the taxonomy diagnostic ones. In a temporal scale, the effects of 

the dominant size of the community could be quantified when nutrients were injected in 

a dynamic coastal environment. In this case, more than 90% of the variance in photo-

physiology was explained by the community size when N:P ratios were above median 

values. 

Although the knowledge on how dominant size fractions of phytoplankton vary 

in time and space are extremely useful tool to understand the overall dynamics of the 

pelagic environment, the bio-optical proxies of phytoplankton dominant cell size in the 

literature could not explain the variability of bulk efficiencies of photochemistry or light 

absorption, even in a given oceanographic region. In contrast, for a costal site, it was 



109 

possible to construct a primary production photo-physiological model in which the 

parameters depended upon the dominant size classes of natural phytoplankton 

communities, physically fractionated, and the ambient nutrient concentration. This 

suggests that either the bio-optical proxies used are not good descriptors of 

phytoplankton photochemistry or that the covariance among size, taxonomy and 

acclimation processes in the costal site sufficed for the parameterization based on size 

alone to be successful.  

 Secondly, the work approached the uncertainties in reconciling ETR and Carbon 

uptake measurements. We have also compared primary production values using 

ETR:Carbon conversion rates (KC) from the literature with rates measured in two 

taxonomic groups, commonly found in our study region, under laboratorial controlled 

conditions, given the complexity of such measurements. Using rates from the literature, 

the calculated primary production values were similar to previous values for this region 

(using C14), reinforcing the viability of this technique for obtaining primary production 

data in larger temporal and spatial scale. From cultures data, we have shown KC rates 

for the two groups tested, which can improve such estimates for this and other coastal 

areas.  

Finally, the study have analyzed the impacts of phytoplankton community 

structure, more especifically of cells size and taxonomy, on KC and other physiological 

rates, under controlled growth conditions (same temperature, nutrients and light). For a 

balanced growth, differences between taxonomic groups were more significant than 

differences according to the respective cells size. Although the use of laboratory grown 

cells is essential to derive constants and rates that are extremely difficult to obtain in 

natural samples, such as the direct electron requirement for carbon assimilation, the 

results should be carefully utilized when compared to natural communities. We have 



110 

shown the importance of interactive effects of cell size and taxonomy in the energy 

allocation to assimilate the organic carbon and maintain the biomass, which is also 

crucial to better understand the dynamics of primary production rates derived from 

photo-physiology in natural environments.
