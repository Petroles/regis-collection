ABSTRACT 

 

Renewable resources are earning special attention as substitutes 

for petroleum-based compounds, considering the future shortage of 

fossil supplies and also due to a sense of environmental awareness. In 

this context, biobased polymers obtained from vegetable oils are 

considered a promising “green” alternative to fossil-derived polymeric 

materials and present potential biodegradability and low toxicity, 

allowing their application for high value added and/or biomedical 

purposes. Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) and thiol-ene reactions 

appear as successful and versatile techniques to obtain high molecular 

weight polymers from renewable raw materials, enhancing the 

possibilities for the synthesis of vegetable oil-based polymers via 

chemical modifications. Additionally, besides avoiding the use of 

organic solvents, working with an environmentally friendly system, 

miniemulsion polymerization enables the production of polymeric 

nanoparticles with unique characteristics and vast commercial interest, 

with the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-insoluble 

compounds for a wide range of applications. Herein, it is reported the 

synthesis and characterization of biobased polymeric nanoparticles 

using a 100% renewable ?,?-diene-diester monomer obtained by 

esterification reaction of 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor oil) 

with 1,3-propanediol (derived from glycerol, which is also derived from 

castor oil). ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization reactions were 

successfully performed in miniemulsion and yielded polymers with 

weight average molecular weight up to 15 kDa (Mn), depending on 

different parameters and type of reactants (comonomers, surfactants, 

catalysts) employed. Then, the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles were 

modified by the oxidation of their sulfur atom to sulfoxide and sulfone 

groups, aiming the development of nanoparticles with high potential for 

the encapsulation and release of bioactive compounds. Lastly, results 

revealed that the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles derived 

from renewable resources did not present any cytotoxic effect on murine 

fibroblast (L929) and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and showed 

high blood biocompatibility, assuring their viability for biomedical 

applications.

RESUMO 

 

Recursos renováveis atraem crescente atenção como substitutos 

para matérias-primas derivadas do petróleo, considerando a futura 

escassez de fontes fósseis e também devido a um sentimento de 

consciência ambiental. Neste contexto, biopolímeros obtidos a partir de 

óleos vegetais são considerados uma promissora alternativa ecológica 

aos materiais poliméricos derivados de fontes fósseis, apresentando 

potencial biodegradabilidade e baixa toxicidade, permitindo sua 

aplicação para propósitos de alto valor agregado e/ou fins biomédicos. 

As reações de metátese de dienos acíclicos (ADMET) e tiol-eno 

aparecem como técnicas bem sucedidas e versáteis para a obtenção de 

polímeros de elevada massa molar derivados de matérias-primas 

renováveis, aumentando as possibilidades para a síntese de polímeros 

derivados de óleos vegetais a partir de modificações químicas. Além 

disso, a polimerização em miniemulsão é um sistema ambientalmente 

amigável, livre de solventes orgânicos e permite a produção de 

nanopartículas poliméricas com características únicas e de grande 

interesse comercial, com a possibilidade de utilização e/ou incorporação 

de compostos e compósitos insolúveis em água para uma vasta gama de 

aplicações, inclusive para fins biomédicos. A possibilidade da obtenção 

de polímeros em meio aquoso, cuja síntese tradicional é sensível à água, 

tais como poliésteres, é uma grande vantagem das reações de 

polimerização ADMET e tiol-eno em miniemulsão. Além disso, muitos 

outros tipos de materiais podem ser obtidos como, por exemplo, 

nanocompósitos, nanocápsulas e partículas híbridas. Como vantagem 

adicional, polímeros que contenham grupos éster na cadeia principal 

podem sofrer hidrólise, permitindo a sua degradação em ambiente 

fisiológico, fator de grande importância para aplicações biomédicas ou 

mesmo para a eliminação do material polimérico no meio ambiente. 

Dessa forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi a síntese e 

caracterização de nanopartículas poliméricas utilizando um monômero 

?,?-dieno-diéster 100% renovável, obtido através da reação de 

esterificação do ácido 10-undecenoico (derivado do óleo de mamona) 

com o 1,3-propanodiol (derivado do glicerol, que também é derivado do 

óleo de mamona). Reações de polimerização ADMET e tiol-eno em 

miniemulsão foram realizadas com sucesso e produziram polímeros com 

massa molar média de até 15 kDa (Mn), dependendo de diferentes 

parâmetros e do tipo de reagentes (comonômeros, surfactantes, 

catalisadores) utilizados. No estudo das reações ADMET, a grande área 

superficial da fase orgânica nas reações em miniemulsão provavelmente 



 

 

aumentou a remoção de etileno (subproduto) do meio reacional, 

favorecendo a reação ADMET e atingindo polímeros com massas 

molares maiores do que os polímeros obtidos por polimerização em 

massa. Através dos resultados obtidos, foi observado que o catalisador 

Umicore M2 e o surfactante não-iônico Lutensol AT80 formaram a 

combinação mais adequada para a realização de reações ADMET em 

miniemulsão. Quando reações tiol-eno foram realizadas em 

miniemulsão, três diferentes monômeros ?,?-dienos (1,7-octadieno, 1,3-

propileno dipenta-1-enoato e 1,3-propileno diundeca-10-enoato) e dois 

ditióis diferentes (1,4-butanoditiol e 2-mercaptoetil éter) foram testados 

e os resultados foram comparados. O iniciador AIBN apresentou uma 

concentração ideal (1 mol%) para a síntese de polímeros com massa 

molar mais elevada, diferente do comportamento esperado em 

polimerizações tradicionais via radicais livres. Em seguida, as 

nanopartículas de poli(tioéter-éster) obtidas foram modificadas através 

da oxidação do átomo de enxofre em grupos sulfóxido e sulfona, 

visando à obtenção de nanopartículas com elevado potencial para o 

encapsulamento e liberação de compostos bioativos. Análises de DLS 

(Espalhamento Dinâmico de Luz) e MET (Microscopia Eletrônica de 

Transmissão) asseguraram a estabilidade de tamanho/polidispersão e 

morfologia das nanopartículas mesmo após o processo de oxidação; 

análises de FTIR e TGA confirmaram a presença de grupos sulfóxido e 

sulfona após a oxidação. Por último, foram realizadas análises de 

biocompatibilidade das nanopartículas de poli(tioéter-éster) obtidas. 

Resultados revelaram que as nanopartículas de origem renovável não 

exibiram efeito citotóxico em células de fibroblasto murinho (L929) e 

câncer cervical humano (HeLa) e, além disso, apresentaram alta 

hemocompatibilidade, viabilizando futuras aplicações biomédicas como 

sistemas carreadores de fármacos.

A significant increase of interest in biobased polymers as 

substitutes for petroleum-based compounds has been observed in the last 

years, considering the depletion of fossil oil reserves and especially due 

to a sense of environmental awareness for waste management (MEIER, 

2009; TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2011; Z. BEYAZKILIC et al., 2015). In this 
context, vegetable oils are one of the most important renewable raw 

materials for the polymer industry due to their relatively low cost, ready 

availability and value added application possibilities (SHARMA; 

KUNDU, 2006; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; MEIER, 2011). 

Moreover, only a few minor modification reactions (if necessary) have 

to be performed in order to obtain suitable monomers for many different 

applications (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011).  

The main components of vegetable oils are triacylglycerols 

(triglycerides), which are highly functionalized molecules, and, 

therefore, have been used in the synthesis of different types of 

monomers and polymers (GÜNER; YA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006; 

MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). Also, the hydrolysis of 

triglycerides provides glycerol (which is widely used as building block 

in polymer science finding application in the synthesis of polyurethanes, 

polyesters, or telomers) and a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty 

acids (that are largely studied as renewable building blocks for the 

synthesis of polymers with high added value and specific properties). 

The reactivity of the unsaturated bonds of both triglyceride and isolated 

fatty acids allows vegetable oils to be employed in a variety of 

polymerization reactions (KARAK; RANA; CHO, 2009; MUTLU, 

2012; TÜRÜNÇ, 2012). 

Contributing for sustainable development not only consists in 

using renewable raw materials, but also involves the application of 

environmentally friendly and high efficient processes. In this line, 

metathesis and click chemistry reactions have arisen as a great step 

forward for “green chemistry” and have opened new paths for the 

synthesis and modification of polymeric materials with targeted 

properties (PORRES, 2013; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 

2011). Besides, Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) and thiol-ene 

polymerization reactions enhance the possibilities for the synthesis of 

vegetable oil-based polymers via chemical modifications through the 

double bonds of ?,?-diene monomers (TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2011).

Organic solvent-free miniemulsion polymerization reactions 

enable to work with an environmentally friendly system and afford 

polymeric nanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by other 

polymerization techniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). In addition, 

miniemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique and presents some 

attractive advantages such as easier temperature control and radical 

compartmentalization inside the polymer particles (promoting high 

polymerization rates and allowing to obtain high molecular weight 

polymers) with the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-

insoluble compounds for a wide range of applications, including 

biomedical purposes (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, 2002; 

ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005; 

CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013).  

There is a high demand for polymeric systems that satisfy a 

number of requirements, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility, 

for biomedical applications (TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2011). Such novel 

materials have been widely used in temporary implants, tissue 

engineering and drug delivery systems (MACHADO; SAYER; 

ARAÚJO, 2016). In this field, biobased polymers obtained from 

vegetable oils are considered very promising due to their potential 

biodegradability (it is possible to include functional groups or even 

chemical bonds that may facilitate biodegradation) and low toxicity 

(BIERMANN et al., 2000; SHARMA; KUNDU, 2006; LLIGADAS et 

al., 2010). 
Based on the above facts, ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization 

in miniemulsion are being recently investigated (PECHER; MECKING, 

2007; 2010; CARDOSO et al., 2014; JASINSKI et al., 2014; LOBRY et 
al., 2014; AMATO et al., 2015; MACHADO et al., 2016), but works 

portraying the polymerization of renewable monomers through these 

reactions in aqueous media are still uncommon in the literature 

(WURM; WEISS, 2014; MACHADO et al., 2016). Furthermore, apart 

from the advantages already mentioned, ADMET and thiol-ene 

reactions allow the synthesis of high molecular weight polyesters in 

aqueous dispersed medium and thereby are suitable for the production of 

polymeric nanoparticles containing ester groups in the main chain, 

which can undergo hydrolysis (RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; ANSETH, 

2005; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007) enabling their 

degradation in physiological environment. These characteristics are of 

great importance for biomedical applications or material disposal 

(JASINSKI et al., 2014; MACHADO; SAYER; ARAÚJO, 2016).

CHAPTER II 

2 REVIEW 
 

This Chapter presents a brief review about the subjects discussed 

in this thesis. Firstly, the synthesis of vegetable oils-derived monomers 

for the production of new polymers is introduced. Then, metathesis and 

thiol-ene reactions are presented, describing characteristics, conditions 

and applications. Lastly, miniemulsion polymerization is discussed, with 

its mechanisms and specificities. 

 

2.1 SYNTHESIS OF MONOMERS FROM VEGETABLE OILS 
 

Currently, vegetable oils are one of the most important sources of 

renewable raw materials for the chemical industry (in Germany, for 

example, 30% of the 2.7 million tons of raw materials from renewable 

sources consumed in 2005 were vegetable oils) and they are widely used 

for manufacturing surfactants, cosmetics and lubricants (MEIER; 

METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007). These renewable raw materials show 

great potential as sustainable resources for the polymer industry because 

the synthetic potential of naturally occurring fatty acids can be exploited 

for monomer and polymer synthesis without many reaction steps. 

Additionally, thermoplastic materials having linear and hyperbranched 

architectures, resulting in polymers with tunable properties, can be 

prepared from fatty acids and their derivatives (TÜRÜNÇ, 2012; 

KARAK; RANA; CHO, 2009). 

According to Meier (2011), the use of vegetable oils as a 

renewable raw material in the polymer industry is a challenge and an 

opportunity that may allow the replacement of existing polymerization 

processes based on petroleum compounds. This approach is not only 

environmentally friendly (green chemistry) because the potential use of 

renewable natural resources is exploited in an efficient manner, but it 

will also be necessary in a few decades due to the depletion of fossil 

resources. 

The main constituents of vegetable oils are triacylglycerols 

(Figure 1), derived from the esterification of glycerol with three fatty 

acids, which make up 95% of the total weight of triglycerides. 

Depending on the fatty acids content, each vegetable oil has specific 

chemical and physical properties (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 

2011; GÜNER; YA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006), which are affected by the 

stereochemistry of the double bonds of the fatty acids chains, the 



30 

 

unsaturation degree and the carbon chain length (MEIER, METZGER; 

SCHUBERT, 2007).

acid chains.

Depending on the used vegetable oils, the separation process can 

lead to a wide variety of fatty acids (saturated or unsaturated), each one 

having different types of functional groups (-OH, epoxy, triple bonds, 

etc.). Table 1 presents the fatty acid content and number of double bonds 

per triglyceride of the most common commodity vegetable oils.

Due to the different functional groups of the fatty acids, these 
renewable raw materials can be used for the synthesis of new monomers 

that may be used in catalytic metathesis reactions, free radical 

polymerization, controlled/living polymerization as well as 

polycondensation reactions through functional groups present in the 

molecule, yielding polyesters, polyamides, polyethers and 



31 

 

functionalized polyolefins (MEIER, 2009). The most commonly fatty 

acids used in polymer chemistry are: oleic, linoleic, linolenic, ricinoleic 

and erucic acids; their structures are shown in Figure 2.

Typically, a triglyceride chain presents 5 chemically reactive 

sites, shown in Figure 3, suitable for posterior modification and 

synthesis of different types of monomer (MUTLU, 2012). However, 

researches about chemical modifications of vegetable oils basically 

present simple variations of the acyl group of the fatty acid. Regarding 

the use of vegetable oils and fatty acids in chemical industries, the most 

classic and well-established chemical transformations is directed to the 

carboxyl and ester groups and relatively underachieved in the side chain 

(MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; GANDINI, 2008; 

RONDA et al., 2011; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). 
When using these conventional modification reactions in the carboxylic 

group, fatty acids are converted into fatty alcohols, soaps, esters, 

thioesters, amides or amines hydrazides (KREUTZER, 1984; HEDMAN 

et al., 2003; TAKAGAKI et al., 2006; BARRAULT; POUILLOUX, 

1997). 
In the past few decades, the selective functionalization of the fatty 

acids alkyl chains has been extensively researched with particular 

attention to the double bond of unsaturated compounds. Surprisingly, 

only a few reactions using the double bond of unsaturated fatty 

compounds are currently applied in the chemical industry: 



32 

 

hydrogenation, epoxidation and ozone cleavage (BIERMANN et al., 

2011). Radical, electrophilic, nucleophilic and also pericyclic additions 

to the double bond of unsaturated fatty acids may lead to a large number 

of novel oleochemicals with interesting characteristics.

Regarding chemical modifications through the double bonds, 

olefin metathesis and thiol-ene reactions appear as alternative and 

efficient processes, enhancing the possibilities for synthesis of vegetable 

oil-based polymers. These two types of reactions are described 

separately in the following sections (2.2 e 2.3).  

 

2.1.1 Castor oil as renewable raw material 
 

In addition to the above mentioned possible chemical 

modifications of existing reactive sites in triglycerides, some fatty acids 

naturally present different functional groups in their alkyl chains. Today, 

the only commercial source of a substituted fatty acid is castor oil, 

cultivated all over the world in temperate zones (MUTLU, 2012). Castor 

oil is a triglyceride composed of fatty acids and glycerol, like any other 

vegetable oil, and 90% of its fatty acid content consists of ricinoleic acid 

- whose carbon chain has a hydroxyl, a very reactive radical. The high 

level of this fatty acid is the reason for the high value of castor oil and 

its several application possibilities in the chemical industry (MUTLU; 

MEIER, 2010). 

Pyrolysis of castor oil (Figure 4) splits the ricinoleate molecule in 

heptaldehyde and undecenoic acid, as well as light gases and a small 

fraction of free fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated) from C10 to C18. 

These two products, heptaldehyde and 10-undecenoic acid, are 

important raw materials for cosmetics (C11 and C7 aldehydes are used 

in soaps, shampoos, talcum powders and perfume formulations), 



33 

 

pharmaceutical and polymeric compounds. Furthermore, heptaldehyde 

is used as a solvent for rubbers, resins and plastics and 10-undecenoic 

acid may be directly used for applications as bactericides and fungicides 

agents (MUTLU; MEIER, 2010). 

Additionally, 10-undecenoic acid proved to be an important 

precursor for the synthesis of antitumor compounds, antibiotics and, 

especially, is one of the oldest renewable “building blocks” used in the 

industry as precursor for Nylon 11 (MUTLU; MEIER, 2010; VAN DER 

STEEN; STEVENS, 2009). Due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in 

its chain, castor oil can be used in the synthesis of a wide variety of 

polyurethane products, ranging from coatings, thermoplastic elastomers, 

rigid and semi-rigid foams, sealants and adhesives for flexible foams, 

clearly showing that castor oil is one of the most promising renewable 

raw materials for the chemical and polymer industry (SHARMA; 

KUNDU, 2008; PETROVIC, 2008; MUTLU, 2012).

2.2 OLEFIN METATHESIS 
 

Among the wide range of organic and organometallic reactions 

allowing obtaining new unsaturated molecules, olefin metathesis 

appears as a very versatile tool that enables chemical transformations 

that were challenging (or even impossible) to perform by any other 

means (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008). Through metathesis 

reactions it is possible to obtain structurally simple olefins having 

different chain lengths and unsaturation degrees, as well as mono- and 

diesters compounds (IVIN; MOL, 1997). 

Olefin metathesis, or transalkylidenation, is a chemical reaction 

involving the position (in Greek: tithemi) exchange (meta) of alkene 



34 

 

fragments generated by the scission of carbon-carbon double bonds. The 

term "olefin metathesis" was firstly introduced by Calderon and 

coworkers in 1960, although there were already reports of 

transalkilidenation reactions since 1950 (CALDERON; CHEN; SCOTT, 

1967; CALDERON, 1972). Proposed for the first time by Hérisson and 

Chauvin in 1971, the accepted mechanism for this transformation 

reaction proceeds, in a reversible manner, through a cycloaddition 

[2 + 2] of an olefinic double bond with a metallocarbene, and the 

consequent cycloreversion of the metallacyclobutane in the opposite 

sense leads to a new olefin and a metal alkylidene, as shown in Figure 5 

(HÉRISSON; CHAUVIN, 1971). 

 
Figure 5. Mechanism for the olefin metathesis reaction proposed by Chauvin.

Olefin metathesis, as depicted in Figure 6, occurs mostly via five 

kinds of chemical reactions, including ring-opening metathesis (ROM), 

ring-closing metathesis (RCM), ring-opening metathesis polymerization 

(ROMP), acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET) and cross-

metathesis (CM) (MUTLU, 2012; MATOS et al., 2007). Cross-

metathesis is a reaction using olefins from two different types, ring-

opening metathesis is characterized by the formation of non-conjugated 

dienes from cyclic olefins and it is the reverse reaction of the ring-

closing metathesis. In addition, polymerization reactions may occur 

between acyclic dienes (ADMET) or involving a chain-growth of cyclic 

alkenes to linear unsaturated polymers (ROMP) (FREDERICO; 

BROCKSOM; BROCKSOM, 2005).  

Metathesis reactions are generally reversible and, with an 

appropriate catalyst system, equilibrium can be reached in a matter of 

seconds, even with substrate/catalyst ratios of 10
4
 (IVIN; MOL, 1997). 

Despite being an excellent tool for organic synthesis, studies about 

olefin metathesis reaction had only a significant advance since the 90s, 

after the development of organometallic compounds by Schrock and 

Grubbs (IVIN; MOL, 1997). The Schrock catalysts, based on neutral 

tungsten and molybdenum alkylidene complexes, are highly reactive 



35 

 

towards different substrates with different steric and electronic 

variations, capable of reacting with internal and terminal olefins, but 

they show sensitivity to polar functional groups, humidity, oxygen, and 

impurities present in the solvent, restricting their usage (SCHROCK et 

al., 1980).

Metathesis), RCM (Ring Closing Metathesis), ROM (Ring Opening 

Metathesis), ROMP (Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization) and ADMET

Kinetic and mechanistic studies were fundamental to the 

development of the so-called well-defined catalysts for metathesis 

reactions, known as first and second-generation Grubbs catalysts, which 

are ruthenium catalytic systems, more robust in air and with various 

polar functional groups. Furthermore, these catalysts enable reactions 

under mild conditions, such as atmospheric pressure and temperatures 

below 100 °C, which may be conducted in common solvents without 

prior purification (GRUBBS, 2004). In 2005, Robert H. Grubbs, Yves 

Chauvin and Richard R. Schrock shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for 

their contributions to olefin metathesis (MATOS et al., 2007; 

FERREIRA; SILVA, 2005). 

 

2.2.1 ADMET polymerization 
 

The development of Acyclic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) 

polymerizations, as for all metathesis reactions, has been closely linked 



36 

 

to the development of catalysts presenting improved activity, selectivity 

and stability (MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011).  

The ADMET reaction has been intensively studied since 

Wagener and colleagues (1990a; 1990b) reported the first examples of 

high molecular weight polymers obtained by polymerization of ?,?-

dienes. This reaction follows a step-growth mechanism and it is driven 

by the release of a low molecular weight condensate, usually ethylene 

(Figure 7). This metathesis reaction produces well-defined and strictly 

linear polymers with (modified) unsaturated polyethylene backbones
 

(BAUGHMAN; WAGENER, 2005) and can only reach high molecular 

weights at high monomer conversion, like all traditional condensation 

polymerizations (MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 

2011). 

 
Figure 7. Schematic representation of an ADMET (Acyclic Diene METathesis) 

polymerization. 

 
Source: Adapted from MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER (2011). 

 

The mechanism of the ADMET polymerization cycle is well 

established (Figure 8). The olefin coordinates to a metal-carbene 

complex, and then a cycloaddition reaction occurs forming a 

metallacyclobutane intermediate (1). At this stage, the productive 

cleavage of the intermediate complex (1) leads to the formation of the 

alkylidene complex (2). A subsequent reaction with the double bond of 

another diene produces a metallacyclobutane ring (3), which 

subsequently leads to the polymer formation. The cycle continues with 

the coordination of another diene or growing polymer, followed by 

productive cleavage and release of ethylene. Once all the species 

involved in the catalytic cycle are in equilibrium, ethylene is generally 

removed from the reaction medium by applying vacuum or using a 

constant flow of an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen, promoting the 

polymer formation (MUTLU, 2012). 

The discovery and usage of the Schrock and Grubbs catalysts 

paved the way for the synthesis of polymers with different architectures 

and functionalities through ADMET reactions. For example, 

applications of the ADMET reaction enabled the development of 

synthetic routes for obtaining perfectly linear polyethylenes and a wide 

range of polyethylenes functionalized and branched with alkyl groups 



37 

 

specifically placed along their main chain (OPPER; WAGENER, 2011). 

Graft copolymers with “perfect comb” structures are also accessible via 

polymerizing ADMET (O’DONNELL et al., 2001).

Recently, Meier and coworkers (RYBAK; MEIER, 2008; 

MONTERO DE ESPINOSA et al., 2009; MUTLU et al., 2010; 

FOKOU; MEIER, 2010) investigated the synthesis and posterior 

polymerization of ?,?-diene monomers derived from vegetable oils. 

Using 10-undecenoic acid (which is the major product of castor oil 

pyrolysis) due to its terminal olefin, different types of ?,?-dienes were 

prepared and submitted to ADMET reactions for obtaining new 

polymeric structures. Thus, acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) reaction 

is a promising technique to obtain high molecular weight polymers from 

renewable raw materials (WARWEL et al., 2001; MEIER; METZGER; 

SCHUBERT, 2007). 

 



38 

 

2.3 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS 
 

The first publication on addition of mercaptans to unsaturated 

compounds was in 1905 when Posner noted that thiols and alkenes 

could react spontaneously with each other or in the presence of an acid 

(POSNER, 1905). In 1926, thiol-ene reactions were presented as a 

polymerization reaction for the very first time, when Braun and Murjahn 

found out that alkyl mercaptans spontaneously gelled upon heating 

(BRAUN; MURJAHN, 1926). However, the widespread polymerization 

mechanism mediated by free radicals, including the individual steps of 

the reaction, was only elucidated by Kharasch, Read and Mayo (1938) 

just before the Second World War in 1938 (CLAUDINO, 2011). 

In the half of the twentieth century, thiol-ene chemistry was a 

widely used method for crosslinking polymers, but the technique fell out 

of favor due to the preference for high molecular weight polymers 

which were not covalently cross-linked (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 

2010). Currently, thiol-ene chemistry is especially used for the 

biofunctionalization of polymers and particles/nanoparticles surfaces for 

biomedical usages; however, there are several different applications 

such as UV curable resins, high impact absorption materials, electronic 

coating and others (STENZEL, 2013; HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). 

Thiol-ene reactions are based on easily abstractable hydrogens of 

the thiol group due to the low energy of the sulfur-hydrogen bond 

(RS
?
—H

?+
), 368.44 kJ.mol

-1
. It occurs because the electron-poor 

hydrogen atom is bonded to a sulfur atom, which is not as 

electronegative as an oxygen atom of an alcohol group (for example, the 

energy of the OH bond of a methyl alcohol (MeO—H) is 

435.43 kJ.mol
-1

). Disruption of the S-H bond may occur through direct 

photolysis or thermolysis, or indirectly via nucleophilic initiators which 

generate free radicals and chemically attack the thiol group; this bond 

cleavage generates electrophilic thiyl radicals (RS•) which are extremely 

reactive and can be added to a wide diversity of unsaturated compounds. 

The addition reaction, known as hydrothiolation of C=C bonds, is 

exothermic, typically between -10.5 and -22.6 kcal.mol
-1

, and 

energetically favorable because a carbon-carbon ?-bond (~370 kJ.mol
-1

) 

is formed instead of a ?-bond, weaker (~235 kJ.mol
-1

) (HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010). 

 

  



39 

 

2.3.1 Thiol-ene polymerization 
 

Like a traditional free-radical polymerization, thiol-ene 

polymerization reaction proceeds divided into three stages: initiation, 

propagation and termination, plus a chain transfer step (Scheme 1). 

Firstly occurs a thermal decomposition of the initiator in a pair of active 

radicals and the reaction of a thiol with an active radical produced, 

resulting in a primary radical RS? (I). Propagation involves a reaction 

between RS? and an alkene, generating an intermediary compound (II); 

thus, the intermediary compound abstracts a hydrogen from another 

molecule of thiol (III), resulting in the thiol-ene addition product and a 

new radical RS?. Termination (IV, V, VI) occurs through radical (RS? 

or carbon-centered radical) combination rather than dispropornation 

(CARLSON; KNIGHT, 1973).

transfer step ( III) and termination (IV, V and VI).

Figure 9 presents the characteristic two steps mechanism of the 

thiol-ene polymerization reaction, divided into initiation, propagation 

and termination, as mentioned above. Firstly, the reaction begins with 

the thiol decomposition into thiyl radicals through hydrogen abstraction, 

which can be induced by photo- or thermoinitiation with the aid or not 

of initiators. The resulting thiyl radical is then added to one of the 

double bonds of the diene (step I), generating an intermediary ?-carbon 

radical, followed by the chain transfer to a second thiol (step II), 



40 

 

resulting in the primary product of the thiol-ene addition, which still 

possess a double bond available for the propagation of the polymer 

chain. Once the mechanism regenerates the thiyl radical, there is no 

consumption of the thiol groups and, hence, the polymerization 

continues in a cyclic sequence. Termination reactions are often 

considered insignificant compared to the propagation rates and generally 

involve bimolecular combination of ?-carbon or thiyl radicals, although 

these processes have not yet been fully elucidated (CLAUDINO, 2011).

radical to a double bond (I); chain-transfer from a carbon-centered radical to a 

thiol-group.

Thiol-ene addition kinetics is strongly influenced by the type of 

the unsaturated compound (terminal, internal, conjugated, non-

conjugated and substituted) and, depending on the thiol structure, the 

reactivity order can be slightly modified (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010; 

LOWE, 2010). Hoyle, Lee and Roper (2004) classified the reactivity of 

certain unsaturated compounds in thiol-ene addition as follows: 

Norbornene &gt; Vinyl ether &gt; Propenyl &gt; Alkene ~ Vinyl ester&gt; N-Vinyl 

amides &gt; Allyl ether ~ Allyltriazine ~ Allylisocyanurate &gt; Acrylate &gt; 

Unsaturated ester &gt; N-substituted maleimide &gt; Acrylonitrile ~ 

methacrylate &gt; Styrene &gt; Conjugated dienes. Additionally, it was found 

that 1-hexene is 8 times more reactive than trans-2-hexene and 18 times 

more reactive than trans-3-hexene, showing the strong effect of the

One of the most important advantages offered by the thiol-ene 

chemistry over classical free-radical polymerizations is the high ability 

to overcome oxygen inhibition. In the case of radical polymerization 

using (meth)acrylates, the oxygen interacts with the radical of a growing 

polymer chain and the chain will immediately terminate due to the 

formation of an alkyl peroxy radical, which has insufficient reactivity to 

continue the propagation step, resulting in short chains fragments 

(HOYLE et al., 2003).  In turn, for thiol-ene polymerization reactions, 
the formation of such radicals due to oxygen presence does not inhibit 

the polymerization because peroxy radicals are capable of abstracting 

the hydrogen from thiol groups and thus generate thiyl radicals, 

continuing the propagation step with new alkenes. Therefore, the 

presence of oxygen in thiol-ene reactions has only a minimal effect on 

the main reaction route but does not affect their products (O'BRIEN; 

CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2006). As hydrogen donor groups, thiols can be 

added (even in small amounts) to formulations with acrylic monomers to 

suppress oxygen inhibition in the polymerization reaction, by trapping 

the peroxy radicals.  

Although known for over a century, thiol-ene addition reactions 

have become very popular in the recent years due to their "click" 

characteristics, such as speed, robustness and efficiency, as well as low 

formation of by-products (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). Even though the 

efficiency of this type of reaction requires terminal unsaturation and 

strongly depends on the thiol used, polymerization reactions of ?,?-

dienes with dithiols have been successfully applied in order to obtain a 

wide variety of new polymers (KREYE; TOTH; MEIER, 2011; 

TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2012; 2013; FIRDAUS et al., 2014).  
For being an effective tool in several areas, used for 

polymerization, curing and polymer modification reactions, thiol-ene 

reactions may be considered as a versatile and efficient tool for the 

synthesis of monomers and high added-value chemicals, and also for 

synthesis and modification of polymers derived from fully renewable 

?,?-diene monomers bearing, for example ester, ether, or amide 

functional groups in the backbone chain (MACHADO; SAYER; 

ARAÚJO, 2016). In addition, by using monomers with different 

functionalities, it is possible to tune some properties of the monomer, 

such as degradability, crosslinking, shrinkage stress and other physical 

features.  

Due to their electronically rich double bonds, vegetable oils and 

derivatives allow the radical addition of different types of molecules, 

especially thiols (MUTLU, 2012). Examples of reactions between 



42 

 

vegetable oils or derivatives and thiols are found in the literature, such 

as the synthesis of telechelic alcohols from 10-undecenoate allyl by 

thiol-ene addition with mercaptoethanol (LLUCH et al., 2010); the 
functionalization of methyl 10-undecenoate, a derivative of castor oil, 

with mercaptoethanol or 1-thioglycerol (TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2010); the 

copolymerization of fatty acid derivatives with ferulic acid derived 

compounds with 1,4-butanedithiol (KREYE; TOTH; MEYER, 2011), 

and others. 

Apart from the already mentioned advantages, thiol-ene reactions 

are considered environmentally friendly because may be carried out 

without solvent, under mild reaction conditions (by photochemical 

initiation, for example) and without using catalysts consisting of 

potentially toxic metal compounds, commonly employed in other "click" 

reactions (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; HOYLE; LOWE; 

BOWMAN, 2010). In addition, biocompatible and biodegradable 

polymers can be synthesized through thiol-ene polymerization for 

biomedical application (WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., 

2014; AMATO et al., 2015).  

 

2.4 MINIEMULSION POLYMERIZATION 
 

Over the last years, miniemulsion polymerization has been 

earning importance and the development of innovative and more 

accessible polymeric materials obtained by this technique has become 

more common due to the combination of some attractive advantages 

such as the absence of solvents, easier temperature control, and radical 

compartmentalization inside the polymer particles (promoting high 

polymerization rates and allowing to obtain high molecular weight 

polymers) with the possibility of using and/or incorporating water-

insoluble reactants and compounds (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; 

ASUA, 2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 

2005), such as several vegetable oils (CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 

2013).  

Miniemulsions are characterized by a heterophase system in 

which submicrometric droplets (size ranging from 50 to 500 nm) of the 

monomer phase (which are formed with the aid of high shear devices) 

are dispersed in a continuous phase, usually water. In these systems, the 

small droplets are protected against coalescence by using an appropriate 

surfactant and the monomer diffusion can be controlled by the addition 

of a costabilizer (LANDFESTER et al., 1999; ASUA, 2002; 



43 

 

LANDFESTER, 2006). A simplified schematic of the miniemulsion 

polymerization process is shown in Figure 10. 
 

Figure 10. Principle of miniemulsion polymerization.

In contrast to emulsion polymerization, that presents micellar 

nucleation, miniemulsion polymerization features droplet nucleation 

and, therefore, each droplet is the polymerization locus, acting like a 

bulk polymerization nanoreactor (UGELSTAD; EL-AASSER; 

VANDERHOFF, 1973). According to Asua (2002), not every droplet is 

necessarily nucleated. Nevertheless, the fact that all or nearly all 

droplets are nucleated allows the reduction or total elimination of the 

need for mass transport of the monomer in the aqueous phase, featuring 

an important advantage of the miniemulsion polymerization process 

compared to conventional emulsion.  

In addition to the droplets nucleation, other nucleation 

mechanisms may possibly occur, such as micellar and homogeneous 

nucleation. Therefore, miniemulsion systems require an evaluation of 

the necessary parameters for the maximization of droplet nucleation. As 

mentioned by Asua (2002), if water-soluble initiators are used, the 

droplets nucleation depends on a sequence of processes. First, there is 

radical formation in the aqueous phase by the initiator decomposition. 

Due to the high water solubility of the radicals, they are not able to enter 

the monomer droplets or micelles. Thus, the radical polymerization 

starts in the aqueous phase by monomer desorption from the droplets, 

resulting in oligomers. As the oligomers grow, they become more 

hydrophobic until they reach a critical length and then enter the 

monomer droplets, characterizing the droplets nucleation, or even enter 

the pre-existing micelles, the so-called micellar nucleation. If the radical 

grows until it reaches a second critical size, further increasing its 

hydrophobicity and inhibiting its entry in the nanodroplets, this growing 



44 

 

oligomer precipitates, yielding a new particle and featuring a 

homogeneous nucleation (GILBERT, 1995). 

It is known that the surfactant concentration in miniemulsions 

should be below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in order to 

prevent the formation of micelles. In the absence of micelles, the 

droplets nucleation depends only on the number of radicals which enters 

the nanodroplets, whilst the resultant radicals precipitate in the aqueous 

phase (homogeneous nucleation). However, Hansen and Ugelstad 

(1979) observed that the presence of micelles also depends on the 

homogenization process used. Using hexadecane as costabilizer and 

applying a low-intensity agitation, the authors reported the formation of 

large droplets of monomer, decreasing the total surface area of 

nanodroplets and, consequently, causing the presence of free surfactant 

in the aqueous phase, yielding micelles and favoring micellar 

nucleation. In contrast, increasing the dispersion intensity resulted in 

smaller droplets and the absence of micelles. Therefore, it can be 

concluded that micelles formation should be avoided combining proper 

homogenization conditions and surfactant concentration below the CMC 

in the aqueous phase. 

The nucleation mechanisms discussed to this point refer to 

polymerization in miniemulsion carried out with a water soluble 

initiator, because when an organic-soluble initiator is applied, the 

nucleation of the monomer droplets is predominant, since the initiator is 

already inside the drop. For this reason, organic-soluble initiators can 

reduce homogeneous nucleation and diffusional degradation 

occurrences, once the radicals are generated inside the droplets and there 

is no need for mass transfer of the monomer through the aqueous phase. 

However, the small volume of the nanodroplets limits the efficiency of 

the hydrophobic initiator due to the higher probability of recombination 

of the newly formed radicals (AUTRAN; CAL; ASUA, 2007). 

Once the miniemulsions are formed, there are two mechanisms 

(shown in Figure 11) which can change the number and size of the 

droplets: diffusional degradation (Ostwald ripening) and coalescence 

between the droplets; and both can lead to the destabilization of the 

miniemulsion. Diffusional degradation is characterized by mass transfer 

of monomer from smaller to larger droplets and the coalescence occurs 

when two or more droplets are sufficiently close to permit their contact, 

thereby forming a single larger drop.

To avoid coalescence, an effective surfactant must be added, 

promoting electrostatic and/or steric stabilization of the droplets 

(CHOU; EL-AASSER; VANDERHOFF, 1980). According to El-Aasser 

and Miller (1997), surfactants must satisfy the following requirements: 

(i) their structure must have polar and non-polar groups; (ii) they must 

be more soluble in aqueous phase and be readily available for adsorption 

on the droplets surface, (iii) they must adsorb strongly and not be easily 

displaced when two droplets collide; (iv) they must be effective at low 

concentrations; (v) they should be relatively inexpensive, non-toxic and 

safe to handle. 

Diffusional degradation can be suppressed by the presence of a 

hydrophobic compound, called costabilizer, in the dispersed phase. 

According to Schork et al. (2005), the costabilizer retards the diffusion 
of monomer from smaller droplets to larger droplets and must have 

characteristics such as high solubility in the monomer, low solubility in 

water and low molecular weight. Costabilizers cannot be able to diffuse 

through the aqueous phase from one droplet to another; therefore, a 

difference in concentration of costabilizer inside the droplets, which 

increases with decreasing droplet size, creates a counterforce upon 

monomer diffusion. Thereafter, an osmotic pressure builds up and 

counteracts the Laplace pressure responsible for diffusional degradation 

(ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; ASUA, 2002; LANDFESTER, 

2003; SCHORK et al., 2005). It is important to mention that the 
surfactant and costabilizer choice is a very important factor for the 

miniemulsion formulation because these compounds remain in the final 

polymer and may have a negative effect on the properties of the 

resulting latex.  

Besides many possibilities for radical polymerization reactions in 

miniemulsion systems, other polymerization routes can be adapted to be 



46 

 

performed in miniemulsion, ranging from anionic, cationic and 

enzymatic polymerization to polyaddition and polycondensation 

(LANDFESTER; MUSYANOVYCH; MAILÄNDER, 2010). 

 

2.4.1 ADMET and thiol-ene reactions in miniemulsion 
 

There is a growing interest to perform metathesis and thiol-ene 

reactions in an aqueous phase aiming to work with an environmentally 

friendly system, but only few works were reported. Additionally, 

besides avoiding the use of organic solvents, the miniemulsion process 

enables the production of polymeric nanoparticles with unique 

characteristics and vast commercial interest - e.g. structured 

nanoparticles presenting different morphologies (LANDFESTER, 

2009): hollow, hybrid, well-defined microstructure, and nanocapsules 

for inorganic solids
 
(ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et al., 2013) or drug 

encapsulation (BERNARDY et al., 2010).  
Pecher and Mecking

 
(2007, 2010) performed aqueous 

miniemulsion polymerizations to obtain poly(phenylene-vinylene) 

conjugated nanoparticles by ADMET polymerization. This first attempt 

on producing polymer nanoparticles by ADMET miniemulsion 

polymerization resulted in polymers with very low molecular weights, 

Mn around 1.5kDa, using Grubbs 2
nd

 generation and Hoveyda-Grubbs 

2
nd

 generation as catalysts and the cationic surfactant DTAC 

(dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride) for colloidal stabilization of the 

nanodroplets/polymeric nanoparticles. Although producing polymers 

with low molecular weights (below 2 kDa), these published studies have 

shown that carrying out metathesis reactions in miniemulsion may allow 

to obtain polymeric nanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by 

other polymerization techniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). 

Recently, Lobry et al. (2014) and Jasinski et al. (2014) reported 

the synthesis of poly(thioether) nanoparticles via thiol-ene reactions in 

miniemulsion using diallyl adipate and ethylene glycol dithiol as 

comonomers. The reactions performed via photopolymerization yielded 

polymers presenting a glass transition temperature (Tg) of -63 ºC and a 

melting temperature (Tm) of 18 ºC. Due to their high crystallinity, the 

polymers were insoluble in most of the organic solvents and, therefore, 

the authors presented the molecular weight only for the soluble part 

(Mn = 30 kDa). 

Amato and coworkers (2015) also performed thiol-ene 

photopolymerization reactions in miniemulsion in order to obtain cross-

linked poly(thioether) nanoparticles. The work investigated the effects 



47 

 

of surfactant concentration, organic phase/water phase ratio and the 

influence of a costabilizer in the miniemulsion. Furthermore, non-

stoichiometric thiol-ene polymerization reactions were performed and 

nanoparticles presenting either thiol or ene functional groups on the 

surface were obtained. 

The possibility of obtaining polymers containing water sensitive 

moieties, such as polyesters, in aqueous dispersed medium is a great 

advantage in performing ADMET and thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion. In addition, many other types of interesting materials 

could be obtained, e.g. nanocomposites, nanocapsules and hybrid 

particles. Moreover, polymers containing ester groups in the main chain 

can undergo hydrolysis, enabling its degradation in physiological 

environment, which is of major importance for biomedical applications 

or even the polymeric material disposal.

3 ADMET REACTIONS IN MINIEMULSION 
 

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Vegetable oils show a high potential as alternative resource for 

the production of polymeric materials because of their renewability, 

world wide availability, relatively low prices, and value added 

application possibilities. These advantages make them very attractive for 

the chemical industry, since their use could replace some petroleum 

based compounds (BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; MONTERO DE 

ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; MEIER, 2011; TÜRÜNÇ, MEIER, 2011). 

Furthermore, these renewable resources are considered to be very 

important for the production of biobased polymers due to, for example, 

their low toxicity and inherent biodegradability (BIERMANN et al., 

2000; SHARMA; KUNDU, 2006; LLIGADAS et al., 2010). 

Vegetable oils primarily consist of triacylglycerols (triglycerides). 

Fatty acids are 95% of the total weight of triglycerides and can be easily 

obtained by hydrolysis (or alcoholysis to obtain the respective esters). 

Depending on the fatty acid distribution, each type of oil has specific 

physical and chemical properties. Fatty acids have been studied as 

renewable building blocks for the synthesis of compounds with high 

added value and specific properties. Furthermore, often only a few 

minor modification reactions have to be performed prior to their 

application (MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; GÜNER; 

YA?CI; ERCIYES, 2006). 

Since many fatty acids are unsaturated, metathesis generally is a 

successful and versatile tool to derivatise their double bonds in order to 

obtain new monomers and polymers (IVIN; MOL, 1997; MEIER; 

METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; 

MEIER, 2009; BIERMANN et al., 2011). In this context, the acyclic 

diene metathesis (ADMET) reaction is a promising technique to obtain 

high molecular weight polymers from renewable raw materials (MEIER; 

METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; 

WARWEL et al., 2001; MUTLU; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; 

MEIER, 2011; OPPER; WAGENER, 2011). The ADMET process has 



50 

 

been intensively studied since Wagener et al. (1990a; 1990b) reported 

the first examples of high molecular weight polymers obtained by 

polymerization of ?,?-dienes. ADMET polymerization follows a step-

growth mechanism and is driven by the release of a low molecular 

weight condensate, usually ethylene. This metathesis reaction produces 

well-defined and strictly linear polymers with (modified) unsaturated 

polyethylene backbones (BAUGHMAN; WAGENER, 2005) and can 

only reach high molecular weights at high monomer conversion, like all 

traditional condensation polymerizations (MUTLU; MONTERO DE 

ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011). Rybak et al. (2008) showed high molecular 

weight polymers (Mn up to 45 kDa) synthesized from undecylenyl 

undecenoate, a 100% castor-oil-derived monomer. 

The synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles has been intensely 

investigated from a fundamental point of view to studies directed for 

specific applications (MEHNERT; MADER, 2001; TIARKS; 

LANDFESTER; ANTONIETTI, 2001; LANDFESTER, 2006; 

PECHER; MECKING, 2007; CAPEK, 2010; LANDFESTER; 

MUSYANOVYCH; MAILÄNDER, 2010). Nanoparticles are frequently 

obtained by free radical polymerization, where an organic phase is 

dispersed in an aqueous phase. In heterophase polymerization 

techniques, the synthesized polymer is not water-soluble and the 

monomer presents low solubility in water. Emulsion polymerization is a 

very well-established system used to synthesize polymeric 

nanoparticles.  

On the other hand, miniemulsion polymerization has been earning 

importance in this field. The number of publications has increased and 

the development of novel polymeric materials obtained by this 

technique has become more common due to the combination of some 

attractive characteristics from conventional emulsion polymerization 

and the possibility of using and/or incorporating water insoluble 

reactants and compounds (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, 2002; 

ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005), such as 
several vegetable oils (CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013). 

Therefore, the miniemulsion process enables the production of 

polymeric nanoparticles with unique characteristics and vast commercial 

interest - e.g. structured nanoparticles presenting different morphologies 

(LANDFESTER, 2009): hollow, hybrid, well-defined microstructure, 

and nanocapsules for inorganic solids (ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et 

al., 2013) or drug encapsulation (BERNARDY et al., 2010). 

There is a growing interest to perform metathesis reactions in an 

aqueous phase aiming to work with an environmentally friendly system, 



51 

 

but only few works were reported. For example, Lynn et al.(1996) 

investigated living ROMP reactions of norbornene derivatives in 

aqueous emulsion and Pecher and Mecking (2007; 2010) performed 

aqueous miniemulsion polymerizations to obtain poly(phe-

nylenevinylene) conjugated nanoparticles by ADMET polymerization. 

This first attempt on producing polymer nanoparticles by ADMET 

miniemulsion polymerization resulted in polymers with very low 

molecular weight, 1.5 kDa, using Grubbs 2nd generation and Hoveyda-

Grubbs 2nd generation as catalysts and a cationic surfactant 

(dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, DTAC) for colloidal stabilization 

of the nanodroplets/polymeric nanoparticles. The absence of organic 

solvents in ADMET reactions in miniemulsion afforded polymeric 

nanoparticles with microstructures inaccessible by other polymerization 

techniques (PECHER; MECKING, 2007). 

Therefore, this Chapter aims to contribute to the study of 

ADMET reactions in aqueous miniemulsion polymerization evaluating 

different types of catalysts and different surfactants (anionic, cationic 

and non-ionic). A set of ADMET polymerizations of 1,3-propylene 

diundec-10-enoate (Figure 12), a diester monomer derived from castor 

oil, was used to evaluate the performance of different types of 

ruthenium-based catalyst (Hoveyda Grubbs 2
nd

 generation, Grubbs 1
st
 

generation and Umicore M2) and surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate - 

SDS, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - CTAB, and Lutensol AT80, 

which is a C16C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 80 ethylene oxide units).

3.2.2 Monomer synthesis 
 

10-Undecenoic acid (50.0 g, 0.27 mol), 1,3-propanediol (8.4 g, 

0.11 mol), p-toluenesulfonic acid (3 g, 0.0157 mol) and toluene (200 

mL) were added to a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic 

stirrer and a Dean-Stark apparatus. The resulting mixture was heated to 

reflux and water was collected as the reaction proceeded. Once the 

reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down. 

Figure 14 shows a scheme of the esterification reaction. After removing 

the toluene under reduced pressure, the residue was filtered through a 

short pad of basic aluminium oxide with hexane as eluent. Hexane was 

removed and the crude product was dissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL) 

and washed two times with water (200 mL). The organic fraction was 

dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced 

pressure. The desired product was isolated in 78% yield (35.2 g) and 

analyzed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy.

3.2.3 ADMET polymerization reactions 
 

For the miniemulsion reactions, 2 pre-emulsions were prepared, 

the first one (1) mixing water (2 mL) and surfactant with chloroform 

(0.25 g) and catalyst (1 mol% related to monomer) and the second (2) 

mixing water (8 mL) and surfactant with monomer (1 g). After 20 min 

of magnetic stirring, 1 and 2 were sonicated separately (Branson 

Ultrasonics Corp., Branson Digital Sonifier W450) for 1 min with an 

amplitude of 60%, using a ½" tip. Then, the miniemulsions were mixed 

and sonicated again for 2 more minutes. An ice bath was used to reduce 

the temperature increase during the sonication. In the case where bulk 

reactions were performed, monomer (1 g) and 1 mol% of the catalyst 

were mixed at the reaction temperature.  

Figure 15 shows the schematic representation of the procedure 

adopted for the miniemulsion reactions. At first, two different attempts 

were performed adding the catalyst directly to the monomer before and 

during the sonication. However, in both cases, the resulting 

miniemulsion was not stable.

Batch polymerization reactions were carried out in 3 mL conical 

vials (Supelco) equipped with screw cap and septum and the mixtures 

were stirred at the desirable temperature. After 6 h, the reactions 

mixtures were diluted in THF and polymerization halted with excess of 

ethyl vinyl ether and stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The 



55 

 

residue was precipitated into cold methanol for polymer isolation by 

filtration and subsequent polymer analysis.  

 

3.2.4 Particle Size Measurements 
 

Intensity average diameters of the polymer particles (Dp) and the 

polydispersity indexes (PDI) were measured by dynamic light scattering 

(DLS - Malvern Instruments, Zeta SizerNano S). The latex samples 

were diluted approximately 1:15 with distilled water prior to DLS 

analysis. 

 

3.2.5 Molecular weight  
 

Molecular weight distributions were determined using a 

Shimadzu SEC System LC-20 A equipped with a SIL-20A auto 

sampler, GPC pre-column PSS SDV analytical (5 µm, 8×50 mm), main-

column PSS SDV analytical 10000 Å (5 µm, 8×300 mm) and a 

RID-10A refractive index detector in THF (flow rate 1 mL×min
-1

) at 

50 °C. The molecular weight distributions were determined relative to 

PMMA standards (Polymer Standards Service, Mp 1100 – 981000 Da). 

 

3.2.6 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
 
1
H NMR and 

13
C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on 

Bruker AVANCE DPX spectrometers operating at 300 and 600 MHz. 

Chemical shifts (?) are reported in parts per million relative to the 

internal standard tetramethylsilane (TMS, ? = 0.00 ppm).  

 

3.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry  
 

DSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere 

(30 mL min

) at a heating rate of 10 °C min

3.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

To start our investigations, the ?,?-diene monomer 1,3-propylene 

diundec-10-enoate was prepared by a procedure found in the literature 

(MUTLU et al., 2010b) using 1,3-propanediol, which can be prepared 

from glycerol by fermentation, and 10-undecenoic acid, a commercial 

derivative of castor oil and an important raw material for cosmetics, 

pharmaceuticals, and polymeric compounds (MUTLU et al., 2010a).
 

ADMET polymerizations of the 100% renewable monomer were 

performed to study the effect of the catalyst and the surfactant type at 

different temperatures (45 and 85 °C), under miniemulsion (Mini) and 

bulk (B) conditions, after 6 h reaction time and the results are shown in 

Table 2.  

The reactions resulted in particle sizes in the range of 

150-350 nm, depending on the type of surfactant employed. The amount 

of SDS and CTAB were fixed to 0.3 wt.% related to water and the non-

ionic Lutensol was fixed to 3.0 wt.%. The weight fraction difference 

between the surfactants is due to the much higher molecular weight of 

Lutensol AT80 (~3.8 kDa).When comparing the mole fraction of the 

surfactants related to water, Lutensol and CTAB present almost the 

same mol fraction, 0.014 and 0.015 mol%, respectively. Although SDS 

presented the higher mol fraction, 0.019 mol%, the stabilization of the 

monomer droplets was less effective, with an average diameter around 

300 nm and highly disperse particle size distribution (PDI superior to 

0.2). SDS is usually a very effective surfactant, but our results indicate 

that there was an interaction between the SDS and the catalyst HG2 

decreasing the stabilization efficiency of SDS and the catalyst activity. 

A first set of experiments (Table 2, entries 1 and 2) showed that 

no polymerization occurred when employing the HG2 catalyst in the 

presence of the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at either 45 or 

85 °C. A similar behavior was observed by Pecher and Mecking (2007) 

using SDS to polymerize 1,4-dipropoxy-2,5-divinylbenzene by ADMET 

polymerization in aqueous miniemulsion using Grubbs 2nd generation 

and HG2 as catalyst, where no polymerization occurred. It has also been 

reported by Lynn and coworkers (1996) that low yields of 

polynorbornene were produced by living ROMP using G1 as catalyst 

and the anionic surfactant SDS. Higher yields were achieved when 

changing to the cationic surfactant DTAB (dodecyltrimethylammonium 

bromide) in this case.

Reactions using the cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 

(CTAB) as surfactant (Table 2, entries 3 and 4) showed that the CTAB 

did not deactivate the catalyst (HG2), as SDS did. However, lower 

molecular weights were obtained when compared to a bulk reaction 

(Table 2, entry 5). It should be mentioned here that no efforts were taken 

to remove the ethylene from this bulk reaction (i.e vacuum or inert gas 

flow) in order to make the results more comparable to the miniemulsion 

reactions. Of course, much higher molecular weights can be achieved, if 

such experimental set-ups are chosen. In any case, these results may be 



58 

 

attributed to partial HG2 catalyst decomposition in water (PECHER; 

MECKING, 2007). Increasing the reaction temperature from 45 to 85°C 

resulted in some increase in the molecular weight due the increased 

catalyst activity (MUTLU et al., 2010b) 

The effect of the catalysts type (G1, HG2, UM2) in miniemulsion 

was investigated under similar conditions in terms of concentrations of 

reagents in the organic phase and temperature (Table 1, entries 4, 7 and 

10) using CTAB as surfactant. The molecular weight distribution was 

analyzed by GPC (Figure 16). The number average molecular weight, 

Mn, of the resulting polymer followed the order UM2 (~7 kDa) &gt;&gt; HG2 

(~2 kDa) &gt; G1 (~1 kDa). This result is in accordance with previous 

works that showed that all indenylidene Ru-catalysts, like UM2, were 

more robust under similar reaction conditions compared to their Ru-

benzylidene counterparts, like G1 and HG2 (MUTLU et al., 2010b; 
BURTSCHER et al., 2008; MONSAERT et al., 2008; ADEKUNLE et 

al., 2010). 
 

Figure 16. GPC traces of ADMET polymerizations in miniemulsion performed 

with HG2 (P4), G1 (P7) and UM2 (P10) as catalyst and CTAB as surfactant. 

 
 

Reactions using the non-ionic surfactant Lutensol AT80 with 

different catalysts (Table 2, entries 6, 8 and 11) produced polymers with 

higher molecular weight (Figure 17) by comparison to the reactions 

using the same catalyst but with the cationic surfactant CTAB (Table 2, 

entries 4, 7 and 10; Figure 16). This effect is more pronounced when 

comparing the polymers P10 (Mn= ~7 kDa) and P11 (Mn= ~15 kDa), 

obtained with CTAB and Lutensol AT80, respectively, and UM2 as 



59 

 

catalyst. The higher reactivity observed in the reactions with the non-

ionic surfactant indicates that the electronic charge of the surfactants 

affected the catalyst activity, although the cationic surfactant did not 

deactivate the catalyst to the same extent as the anionic surfactant did.  

DSC results (Figure 18) showed that polymer P11 (Table 2, entry 

11), obtained with UM2 and Lutensol AT80, exhibited a quite sharp Tm 

peak at 30.0 °C, indicating a higher structural regularity by comparison 

to polymer P10 (Table 2, entry 10), obtained with UM2 and CTAB, 

which presented a broader melting transition peak probably because of 

its broader molecular weight distribution with peaks of low molecular 

weight polymer. 
 

Figure 17. GPC traces of ADMET polymerizations in miniemulsion performed 

with HG2 (P6) and UM2 (P11) as catalysts and Lutensol AT80 as surfactant. 

 
 

The molecular weight of the reaction performed in miniemulsion 

using the catalyst UM2 and Lutensol AT80 as surfactant (Table 2, entry 

11) was more than three times higher than the molecular weight of the 

reaction in bulk (Table 2, entry 12). Apparently, the much higher surface 

area of the organic phase in miniemulsion polymerization improved the 

release of the ethylene formed during the metathesis reaction from the 

polymer particles as the bulk reaction was performed without any 
attempt, such as vacuum or nitrogen flow, to remove the ethylene from 

the reaction medium. Therefore, results showed that using Umicore M2 

and the non-ionic Lutensol AT80 resulted in the highest molecular 

weight obtained in the present work.

3.4 CONCLUSION 
 

ADMET reactions were successfully performed in miniemulsion. 

The studied process produced polymers with weight average molecular 

weight up to 15 kDa (Mn), depending on the catalyst and the surfactant 

employed. The Ru-indenylidene catalyst, UM2, has presented higher 

activity in water by comparison to the Ru-benzylidene catalysts, G1 and 

HG2. In addition, the catalysts activity was significantly affected by the 

type of the surfactant. The large surface area of the organic phase in 

miniemulsion probably enhanced ethylene removal from the reaction 

locus, promoting ADMET polymerization and achieving higher 

molecular weights than in bulk. Moreover, Umicore M2 catalyst and the 

surfactant Lutensol AT80 were found to be the most suitable 

combination for ADMET reactions in miniemulsion polymerization.

This chapter is part of a publication entitled “Biobased polymeric 

nanoparticles from castor oil derivatives by thiol-ene miniemulsion 
polymerization” under submission. 

 

4 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS IN MINIEMULSION 
 

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Thiol-ene polymerization is considered as a click-chemistry 

reaction because it can be carried out under mild conditions and 

normally provides a high yielding and generation of inoffensive by-

products (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). 

In addition, thiol-ene reaction has been shown as a versatile tool to 

produce polymers from fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers bearing, 

for example ester, ether, or amide functional groups in the backbone 

chain (FIRDAUS; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; 

TÜRÜNÇ, 2012; TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2013).  

There is a growing interest in developing novel biomaterials 

aiming applications in drug delivery systems, tissue engineering and 

environmental issues. In this context, thiol-ene reactions have been 

earning attention due to the improved mechanical properties, unique 

crosslinking structure and tunable degradability behavior provided by 

these click reactions (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; HOYLE; 

LOWE; BOWMAN, 2010; REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005). 

Moreover, thiol-ene mechanism provides clean and environmentally 

harmless reactions, without using organic solvents and toxic metal 

catalysts, which are commonly employed in other "click" reactions and 

also in metathesis reactions (such as ADMET).  

Apart from the advantages already mentioned, thiol-ene reactions 

allow the synthesis of high molecular weight polyesters in aqueous 

dispersed medium and thereby are suitable for the production of 

polymeric nanoparticles containing ester groups in the main chain, 

which can undergo hydrolysis, enabling their degradation in 

physiological environment, which is of great importance for biomedical 

applications or material disposal (JASINSKI et al., 2014; MACHADO; 

SAYER; ARAÚJO, 2016).  

Besides avoiding the use of organic solvents, miniemulsion 

polymerization possesses some advantages over other types of 

polymerization such as bulk and solution polymerizations, because it 



62 

 

yields products with low viscosity and therefore mass, heat and 

momentum transfer is improved. Additionally, the miniemulsion process 

enables the production of polymeric nanoparticles with unique 

characteristics and vast commercial interest (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 

1997; ASUA, 2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002). Thiol-ene 

step-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is being currently 

investigated and only a handful of articles have been published in the 

literature (JASINSKI et al., 2014; LOBRY et al., 2014; AMATO et 
al., 2015; MACHADO et al., 2016). Furthermore, works portraying the 

polymerization of renewable monomers through thiol-ene 

polymerization in aqueous dispersed medium are still uncommon.  

Herein, it is presented the synthesis and characterization of 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles via thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion using a fully renewable ?,?-diene monomer (derived from 

castor oil and glycerol). Furthermore, little is known about the reactivity 

of different diene monomers in thiol-ene reactions, especially in the 

presence of water. Thus, the goal of this chapter is to provide basic 

information regarding this matter.  

 

4.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 

4.2.1 Materials 
 

10-Undecenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), 1,3-propanediol 

(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.6%), p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Sigma-

Aldrich, 98.5%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), 

1,4-butanedithiol (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;97%), 2-mercaptoethyl ether 

(Sigma-Aldrich, 95%), 4-pentenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), 1,7-

octadiene (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), Lutensol AT80 (BASF), which is a 

C16C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 80 ethylene oxide units (molecular 

weight ca. 3.8 kDa). All materials were used as received. Distilled water 

was used in all experiments.  

 

4.2.2 Monomer synthesis 
 

The 100% renewable ?,?-monomer 1,3-propylene diundec-10-

enoate was  prepared following the procedure described in Chapter 3, 

session 3.2.2.  

For the short ?,?-diene diester monomer, 4-pentenoic acid 

(27.0 g, 0.27 mol), 1,3-propanediol (8.4 g, 0.11 mol), p-toluenesulfonic 

acid (3 g, 0.0157 mol) and toluene (200 mL) were added to a round-



63 

 

bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a Dean-Stark 

apparatus. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux and water was 

collected as the reaction proceeded. Once the reaction was completed, 

the reaction mixture was allowed to cool. Figure 19 shows a scheme of 

the esterification reaction. After removing the toluene under reduced 

pressure, the residue was filtered through a short pad of basic aluminium 

oxide with hexane as eluent. Hexane was removed and the crude product 

was dissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL) and washed two times with 

water (200 mL). The organic fraction was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 

and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The desired product 

was isolated in 62% yield (16.4 g) and analyzed by

4.2.3 Thiol-ene polymerization reactions 
 

For the miniemulsion reactions, the aqueous phase was prepared 

mixing water (10 mL) and the surfactant SDS (wt. %) and the mixture 

was let stirring until complete surfactant solubilization. The organic 

phase was prepared mixing ?,?-diene monomer (1.0 g) and, if used, 

organic-soluble initiator (AIBN) under magnetic stirring until complete 

initiator solubilization. The aqueous phase was added to the organic 

phase and, after 10 min of vigorous magnetic stirring (500 rpm), a pre-

emulsion was obtained. Then the dithiol was added to the system (1:1 

dithiol-to-diene molar ratio) with a micropipette and the mixture was let 

under mild magnetic stirring (250 rpm) for 5 minutes. The final 

emulsion was sonicated for 2 minutes with amplitude of 60% in a pulse 

regimen (10 seconds of sonication, 2 seconds of pause), using a Branson 

Digital Sonifier model W450 and a ½" tip. An ice bath was used to 

reduce the temperature increase during the sonication.  

Figure 21 shows the schematic representation of the procedure 

adopted for the miniemulsion reactions.

In the case where bulk reactions were performed, diene monomer 

(1 g) and organic-soluble initiator (AIBN) were mixed at room 



65 

 

temperature and, after complete initiator solubilization, dithiol was 

added to the system (1:1 dithiol-to-diene molar ratio). 

Batch polymerization reactions were carried out in 3 mL conical 

vials (Supelco) equipped with screw cap and septum and the mixtures 

were stirred at 80 ºC. After 3 h, the reactions mixtures were diluted in 

THF and the residue was precipitated into cold methanol for polymer 

isolation by filtration and subsequent polymer analysis.  

 

4.2.4 Particle Size Measurements 
 

Intensity average diameters of the polymer particles (Dp) and the 

polydispersity indexes (PDI) were measured by dynamic light scattering 

(DLS - Malvern Instruments, Zeta SizerNano S). The latex samples 

were diluted approximately 1:15 with distilled water prior to DLS 

analysis. 

 

4.2.5 Molecular weight  
 

Molecular weight distributions were determined using a 

Shimadzu SEC System LC-20 A equipped with a SIL-20A auto 

sampler, GPC pre-column PSS SDV analytical (5µm, 8×50mm), main-

column PSS SDV analytical 10000 Å (5 µm, 8×300mm) and a RID-10A 

refractive index detector in THF (flow rate 1 mL×min
-1

) at 50 °C. The 

molecular weight distributions were determined relative to PMMA 

standards (Polymer Standards Service, Mp 1100 - 981000 Da). 

 

4.2.6 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
 
1
H NMR and 

13
C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on 

Bruker Ascend 600 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. Chemical shifts 

(?) are reported in parts per million relative to the internal standard 

tetramethylsilane (TMS, ? = 0.00 ppm). Analyses were performed at the 

Laboratório de Ressonância Magnética Nuclear – LRMN, University of 

Brasília – UnB, Brazil. 

 

4.2.7 Differential scanning calorimetry  
 

DSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere 

(30 mL min-1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min
?1

 on a Mettler Toledo DSC 

823 calorimeter. The melting temperature, Tm, was recorded from the 



66 

 

second heating ramp, from -50 ºC to 180 ºC. 

 

4.2.8 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
 

Particle morphology characterization was performed by 

Transmission Electron Microscopy using a JEM-1011 TEM (100 kV). 

For this analysis, the sample was diluted in distilled water down to 

0.01% of solids content and one single drop was placed on a carbon-

coated copper grid. Then the grid was dried under room conditions 

overnight. These analyses were performed in the Laboratório Central de 

Microscopia Eletrônica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina.  

 

4.2.9 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) 
 

Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-

FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker spectrometer, model 

TENSOR 27, in the range of wavenumbers 4000-600 cm
-1

 by 

accumulating 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
-1

. The polymer samples 

were analyzed (as powder) in the Laboratório de Materiais (LABMAT) 

at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Federal University of 

Santa Catarina. 

 

4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
To start our studies, three different ?,?-diene monomers (M1, 

M2, M3) and two different dithiols (BDT and MEE) with different chain 

lengths and functional groups (Figure 22) were chosen to perform thiol-

ene polymerization reactions under miniemulsion and bulk conditions. 

M1 (1,7-octadiene) is commercially available and is obtained from non-

renewable resources. This monomer does not present any ester group 

and therefore the polymer derived from this monomer does not undergo 

hydrolysis. M2 and M3, both ?,?-diene diester monomers, were 

synthesized by a esterification procedure using 1,3-propanediol; M2 was 

prepared using 4-pentenoic acid and M3, using 10-undecenoic acid.

In the first experiments (Table 3), a set of reactions was 

performed in bulk to verify the effect of initiator concentration on the 

molecular weight. The experiments were carried out at 80 ºC for 3 h and 

1,4-butanedithiol was employed as comonomer. For all reactions the 

yielding based on monomer consumption (quantified by gravimetry and 
1
H NMR analyses) was higher than 99% as usually occur in step-growth 

polymerization.

Reactions using 1,7-octadiene  (B1, B2, B3) showed no 

difference when the amount of the initiator AIBN was increased from 

0.25 to 0.5 and 1 mol% (related to the dithiol), resulting in number 

average molecular weight, Mn, around 4.3 kDa. When using the 

monomer 1,3-propylene dipent-4-enoate (B4, B5, and B6), reactions 

presented the same  behavior, resulting in Mn around 5 kDa, regardless 

of initiator concentration. On the other hand, reactions using 1,3-

propylene diundec-10-enoate  (B7, B8, B9 and B10) showed  an  

increase  in  the molecular  weight when increasing the initiator 

concentration (Figure 23). Generally, molecular weight in radical 

polymerization drifts to lower values with the increase in initiator 

concentration (ODIAN, 2009); in thiol-ene polymerization, however, 

this behavior was not observed. One possible reason is the unique 

mechanism of thiol-ene polymerization, based on two main steps: the 
addition of a thiyl radical across the ene double bond followed by the 

electron transfer from the carbon centered radical to a thiol group. 

Therefore, molecular weight in thiol-ene polymerization is more likely 



69 

 

to depend on functional group conversion than on initiator 

concentration. 
 

Figure 23. GPC traces of poly(thioether-ester) samples obtained using monomer 

M3 under different concentrations of AIBN.  

 
 

Comparing the three monomers, only thiol-ene polymerization 

with 1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate (M3) had an increase in 

molecular weight with the increase of initiator. This might be due to the 

difference in kinetics intrinsically attained to different types of 

monomeric structures. It is likely that the thiol-ene polymerization 

kinetics with both M1 and M2 monomers are faster than with monomer 

M3, and thus achieving in shorter reaction times, or lower initiator 

amounts, high degrees of polymerization up to the maximum. At 

functional group conversion limit due to kinetic issues, such as low 

mobility of polymeric chains, there is no increase in molecular weight. 

Thus possibly monomers M1 and M2 reached the degree of 

polymerization limit, the functional group conversion limit, regardless 

initiator concentration, whilst monomer M3 possess a slower 

polymerization kinetics and presents an increase in degree of 

polymerization, i.e. molecular weight, with the increase of initiator 

concentration. Polymers with monomer M3 reached higher molecular 

weight (Figure 24) because 1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate has a 

higher molecular weight (408.3 Da) than 1,7-octadiene(110.2 Da) and 

1,3-propylene dipent-4-enoate (240.3 Da) (see Figure 22). This 



70 

 

explanation based on the monomer’s molecular weight can be further 

confirmed when the polymerization reactions with monomers M1 and 

M2 are compared, even though there is only a slight difference in the 

polymers’ molecular weight. 

 
Figure 24.GPC traces of poly(thioether) samples obtained using 0.5 mol% of 

AIBN and different types of diene monomers (M1, M2 or M3).  

 
 

The melting point (Tm) of polymeric samples was checked by 

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and results are displayed in 

Figure 25. As observed, the synthesized poly(thioether)s presented sharp 

melting endotherms, a characteristic  of semicrystalline polymers, 

similar to other thioether containing polyesters. This phenomenon for 

thioether containing homopolyesters was already mentioned and 

attributed to melting and recrystallization processes occurring during the 

calorimetric run (LOTTI et al., 2006). Figure 25 also reveals a variation 
of the Tm from 42 ºC to 72 ºC, depending on the diene monomer 

copolymerized with 1,4-butanedithiol; the higher Tm of B9 is due to the 

longer chain length of M3 (if compared to M1 and M2) and a more 

regular structure of the polymer (spacing of the ester groups), both 

allowing a better crystallization of B9. In addition, the polymers 
exhibited double melting endotherms revealing that the polymers first 

undergo a melting process causing an increase in chain mobility and 

leading to a crystallization, which is followed by a second melting (YU 

et al., 1983; TÜRÜNÇ, MEIER, 2010).

It is important to mention that the glass transition temperature of 

the polymers was not possible to observe by DSC analysis due to their 

crystallinity; however, the Tg could be determined by relaxation methods 

such as dynamic mechanical and dielectric spectroscopies (FOCARETE 

et al., 2001).

(B3), M2 (B6) or M3 (B9) using 1 mol% of AIBN.  
 

 
 

Since the goal of this study is to obtain polymeric nanoparticles 

by thiol-ene polymerizations in miniemulsion, the three different diene 

monomers (M1, M2, and M3) were used in copolymerization reactions 

with 1,4-butanedithiol in miniemulsion. All reactions were carried out at 

the same conditions of temperature (80 ºC), time (3 hours), type and 

amount of surfactant (SDS, 0.019 mol% related to the water) and dithiol 

content (1:1 dithiol-to-diene ratio) used. Table 4 shows the intensity 

average particle size (Dp), number average (Mn) and weight average 

(Mw) molecular weight of the final samples of the reactions varying the 

type of diene monomer and initiator (AIBN) amount.

Reactions using 1,7-octadiene (M1) as monomer presented no 

stability due to its higher hydrophilicity, therefore new attempts adding 

a costabilizer (hexadecane or Crodamol®) to the formulation were 

performed and stable latexes were obtained (see Attachments). These 

results are not shown herein because we only wanted to compare results 

with the same formulation (without costabilizer). 

When M2 or M3 were employed, reactions resulted in particle 

sizes in the range of 114-290 nm, depending on the monomer used, and 

polydispersity index (PdI) around 0.2. Reactions using 1,3-propylene 

dipent-4-enoate (M2) presented larger average particle diameters due to 

its higher hydrophilicity (shorter carbon chain) compared to M3. 

Again, thiol-ene polymerization with M3 presented an increase in 

molecular weight with the increase of initiator concentration (Figure 

26), achieving its maximum Mn at the concentration of 1 mol% of AIBN 
(Mini 6) and turning to decrease when the amount of AIBN was further 

increased to 1.5 mol% (Mini7).

Figure 26. GPC traces of poly(thioether-ester) samples obtained using monomer 

M3 under different concentrations of AIBN in miniemulsion. 

 
 

Continuing the investigation, polymerization reactions of the 

fully renewable monomer M3 were carried out under new conditions, 

such as different types of surfactant (SDS or Lutensol AT80) and dithiol 

(1,4-butanedithiol and 2-mercaptoethyl ether), to evaluate the effect on 

molecular weight distribution. The experiments in miniemulsion (shown 

in Table 5) resulted in particle sizes in the range of 114 –173 nm and 

polydispersity index (PdI) below 0.2, depending on the surfactant 

employed.  

When comparing reactions using M3, BDT and 1 mol% of AIBN 

in bulk (B9) and miniemulsion (Mini6), it can be noticed similar results 

for molecular weight (Mw = 33 kDa), evidencing that thiol-ene reactions 

in miniemulsion yielded comparable results to those in bulk. However, 

reaction Mini8, using Lutensol AT80, presented lower molecular weight 

than reaction Mini6, using SDS; this result is probably due to the higher 

average particles diameter (Dp) obtained using Lutensol as surfactant 

(173 nm), since an increase in the droplet size may increase bimolecular 

termination probability due to the higher content of radicals inside the 

droplet. In miniemulsion systems, radical compartmentalization allows 

faster polymerization rates and higher molecular weights 

(LANDFESTER, 2003; COSTA et al., 2013); however, thiol-ene 

reactions not just depend on average number of radicals per particle but 

mostly on the stoichiometry (CRAMER et al., 2003). Therefore, radical 



74 

 

compartmentalization effect occurs only if the stoichiometric balance is 

not impaired in the polymerization locus (MACHADO et al., 2016).

Also, polymer obtained with MEE in miniemulsion (Mini9), 

presented lower molecular weight by comparison to the polymer 

obtained with BDT in miniemulsion (Mini6), probably due to the high 

hydrophilicity of MEE (its water solubility is approximately 10 times 

higher than that of 1,4-butanedithiol), resulting in less thiyl radicals per 

nanodroplet and therefore creating a stoichiometric disbalance in the 

polymerization locus. As mentioned before, thiol-ene polymerization is 

sensitive to variations in stoichiometry and thus molecular weight is not 

allowed to further increase. Figure 27 shows GPC results of the 

poly(thioether-ester)s obtained in reactions with M3 under different 

conditions (B9, Mini8, Mini9). 

FTIR spectra of a dried sample from reaction Mini6 is presented 

in Figure 28. It can be noticed that there is no peak correspondent to 

double bonds at 1640 cm

(C=C stretch), indicating absence of residual 

diene monomer. Additionally, the presence of C—S—C stretching 

vibration can be observed at ~710 cm

, evidencing the addition of thiyl 

radicals across the double bonds of the diene.

important to mention that the morphology of non-cross-linked polymer 

particles with low glass transition temperature is not very often 



76 

 

successfully analyzed by TEM, except when cryo-TEM is available. 

Therefore, the TEM equipment was operated at the lowest current 

possible; when the current was increased during the microscopic 

analyses, the polymeric particles melted (Tm &amp;lt;80 ºC). Figure 29 shows 

the particles before (a, c) and after melting (b, d).

4.4 CONCLUSION 
 

Herein, thiol-ene polymerization reactions were successfully 

performed in miniemulsion and poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles were 

obtained from a fully renewable diene monomer derived from castor oil 

(1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate). Three different ?,?-diene monomers 

(1,7-octadiene, 1,3-propylene dipent-1-enoate and 1,3-propylene 

diundec-10-enoate) and two different dithiols (1,4-butanedithiol and 2-

mercaptoethyl ether) were evaluated and the results were compared. 

Reactions yielded polymers with weight average molecular weight up to 

15.3 kDa (Mn), depending on the comonomers employed and the

initiator concentration. Additionally, AIBN (initiator) presented an ideal 

concentration (1 mol %) to achieve higher molecular weight, a different 

behavior of the observed in traditional free radical polymerization. 

Moreover, the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles derived 

from renewable resources present potential degradability properties 

(hydrolysable bonds in the main chain) and biocompatibility; therefore, 

the (bio)degradation of these particles and cytotoxicity/biocompatibility 

tests should be performed for future biomedical applications.

CHAPTER V 

 

5 OXIDATION OF POLY(THIOETHER) TO POLYSULFONE 
NANOPARTICLES 

 

This chapter is part of a publication entitled “Oxidation of 

Poly(thioether) to Polysulfone Nanoparticles”, under submission. 

 

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Thiol-ene “click” reactions can be effectively used in a large 

number of applications, ranging from synthetic processes for basic 

chemical synthesis to the fabrication of a wide range of polymeric 

materials and new applications, including optical displays, nano-

imprinting, holographic diffractive materials, microfluidic devices, high-

impact energy-absorbing devices, complex surface patterns, optical 

switching arrays, and functionalized linear polymers. However, 

applications requiring materials with high glass transition temperature 

(Tg), such as dental restoratives, optical components and automotive/ 

aerospace repair resins, are not readily achievable using most traditional 

thiol–ene combinations, since thioether-linkages are characterized by 

flexible sulfide bonds (LI, 2007; CARIOSCIA et al., 2007; HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010).  

Therefore, easy post polymerization modification of polymer 

backbones appears as an important and challenging concept in polymer 

science. Hydrophobic thioether can be oxidized to more polar sulfoxide 

or sulfone derivatives (POTAPOV et al., 2011). The presence of polar 
sulfone groups in polymer backbones generates interesting properties 

due to the strong interactions between sulfone groups (dipole moment of 

4.5 Da). The high polarity of these functional groups tends to increase 

the Tg and thermal stability of the material, leading to a modified 

polymer surface energy with improved adhesion characteristics, 

paintability or pigment wetting (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). 

Furthermore, sulfone groups present in polymer chains can also lead to 

liquid crystallinity (ZHANG 1994). 

Because of the very low dipole moment of thioethers, these 

compounds are generally hydrophobic; upon oxidation, they are 

converted to high-dipole-moment sulfoxides and/or sulfones, leading to 

an increase in affinity towards water (VO; KILCHER; TIRELLI, 2009). 

Therefore, oxidation could act as a trigger that converts a material from 

hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Thus, due to the associated morphological 



80 

 

transitions promoted, such as the swelling of a polymer network or the 

solubilization of individual macromolecules, poly(sulfone) nanoparticles 

dispersed in a hydrophilic solvent could be used for releasing 

encapsulated bioactive compounds or for uncovering groups capable of 

specific interactions with cells (JASINSKI et al., 2016).  

So far, Rehor, Tirelli and Hubbell (2002, 2005) studied the 

synthesis of oxidation responsive poly(thioether) nanoparticles through 

emulsion ring-opening polymerization of propylene sulfide. Recently, 

Jasinski and coworkers (2016) reported the synthesis and application of 

poly(thioether-ester) latexes via thiol-ene miniemulsion 

photopolymerization. The combination of thioether and ester bonds in 

the same polymer backbone could provide nanoparticles potentially 

sensitive to oxidation and hydrolysis, acting as dual-stimuli-responsive 

nanocarriers (JASINSKI et al., 2016). 
Among the different oxidants and catalysts useful for the 

oxidation of thioethers, hydrogen peroxide is known as the most 

versatile and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the oxidation of 

sensitive sulfides by hydrogen peroxide usually proceeds under 

relatively mild conditions and, in several cases, only a small excess of 

H2O2 is required (NOYORI; AOKI; SATO, 2003; POTAPOV et al., 

2011). In addition, due to its solubility in water, hydrogen peroxide is 

very suitable for oxidizing poly(thioether) particles dispersed in aqueous 

media (JEANMAIRE et al., 2014).   

Herein, it is presented the post polymerization oxidation of 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles, synthesized in Chapter IV, using a 

hydrogen peroxide solution, a well-known process to oxidize the sulfur 

atom successively to sulfoxide and sulfones. Morphology and thermal 

properties of the oxidized polymers were analyzed and compared to the 

original polymers (before oxidation). Furthermore, FTIR spectra of the 

samples were evaluated to verify the structure of the obtained materials. 

 

5.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 

5.2.1 Materials 
 

Polymeric samples from reaction Mini6, obtained previously in 

Chapter IV. Hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%, Sigma-Aldrich), 

sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and sodium 

bicarbonate (Vetec, 99,7%). All materials were used as received. 

Distilled water was used in all experiments.  

 



81 

 

5.2.2 Oxidation procedure 
 

For solid polymer samples (previously precipitated in methanol), 

0.2 g of polymer was dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) and, 

subsequently, hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%, 0.6 mL) was added 

to the reaction flask (S-OXI). 

For latex samples, 2 g of miniemulsion (0.2 g of polymer, 

approximately) was mixed with 6g of a SDS solution (0.25 wt.% in 

water) and then 0.6 mL of hydrogen peroxide solution (35 wt.%) was 

added dropwise (L-OXI). 

After 3 h of reaction at 64 °C, the formed polymer was 

precipitated in a methanol–water (60:40) mixture. The precipitated 

polymer was then washed successively with sodium bicarbonate 

(100 mL), water (100 mL), and methanol (100 mL) prior to drying in a 

vacuum oven at room temperature. The procedure adopted was found in 

the literature (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). 
 

5.2.3 Particle Size Measurements 
 

Intensity average diameters of the polymer particles (Dp) and the 

polydispersity indexes (PdI) were measured by dynamic light scattering 

(DLS - Malvern Instruments, Zeta SizerNano S). The latex samples 

were diluted approximately 1:15 with distilled water prior to DLS 

analysis. 

 

5.2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry  
 

DSC experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere 

(30 mL min-1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min
?1

 on a Mettler Toledo DSC 

823 calorimeter. The melting temperature, Tm, was recorded from the 

second heating ramp, from -50 ºC to 180 ºC. 

 

5.2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) 
 

Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-

FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a Shimadzu spectrometer, model 

IRprestiage-21, in the range of wavenumbers 4000-400 cm
-1

 by 

accumulating 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
-1

. The polymer samples 

were analyzed as mulls, prepared by mixing the polymer with dry KBr 

powder and pressing into a transparent KBr pellet. 

 



82 

 

5.2.6 Thermogravimetric Analyses (TGA) 
 

Thermal decomposition was studied by thermogravimetric 

analysis (TGA, STA 449 F3 Jupiter, NETZSCH). Approximately 10 mg 

of each sample was weighed in a platinum pan and heated from 50 ºC to 

800°C, at a heating rate of 5 ºC min
-1

, under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 

mL/min.    

 

5.2.7 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
 

Particle morphology characterization was performed by 

Transmission Electron Microscopy using a JEM-1011 TEM (100 kV). 

For this analysis, the sample was diluted in distilled water down to 

0.01% of solids content and one single drop was placed on a carbon-

coated copper grid. Then the grid was dried under room conditions 

overnight. These analyses were performed in the Laboratório Central de 

Microscopia Eletrônica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina.  

 

5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

Aiming to modify the backbone of the polythioether samples 

synthesized in Chapter IV and thus obtain materials with different 

properties, the thioether-linkages of the polymer chains were oxidized to 

sulfones and sulfoxide linkages, using hydrogen peroxide solution. In 

the process, 4 eq. of hydrogen peroxide (in relation to the sulfur function 

in the polymer chain) was used. In order to compare the oxidation 

processes for the nanoparticles and for the polymers obtained in bulk, 

one aliquot of the latex obtained from reaction Mini6 (Mn=15.3 kDa; 

Chapter IV) was precipitated in cold methanol, the polymer was 

solubilized in chloroform and oxidized in solution (S-OXI), while other 

aliquot was oxidized in latex (aqueous miniemulsion) form (L-OXI), i.e. 

without polymer precipitation. After 3 hours of reaction, the resultant 

materials were precipitated in methanol and purified prior to 

characterization analyses. One aliquot of the latex material (L-OXI) was 

reserved for DLS and TEM measurements. 

DLS measurements assured the stability of the latex after 

oxidation, showing that the particles size remained at 140 nm 

(PDI = 0.13). Figure 30 displays the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) for 

the nanoparticles before (Mini6) and after (L-OXI) oxidation. Also, 

Figure 31 shows TEM images of the oxidized latex (L-OXI) confirming 



83 

 

that the morphology of the nanoparticles was maintained even after the 

oxidation process.

reactions, which was confirmed by the peaks observed in 1022 cm

The thermal behaviors of the polymeric samples before (Mini 6) 

and after oxidation (L-OXI and S-OXI) were examined by 

thermogravimetric analyses (Figure 33). It can be noticed a thermal 

instability around 250 ºC for the oxidized polymers, which did not 

happen with the non-oxidized polymer (Mini 6). This behavior probably 

occurred due to the cracking of the sulfoxide groups to sulfenic acid and 

alkene (LEE; LITT; ROGERS, 1998). Thus, in order to further verify 

the degradation of the oxidized polymers, sample L-OXI was submitted 

to thermal decomposition up to 250 ºC (for 30 min, under nitrogen flow) 

and the product was analyzed by FTIR (Figure 34). The thermal 

instability at 250 ºC of the sulfoxide groups was confirmed by the 

reduction of the peak observed in 1022 cm
-1

 (sulfoxide specific IR 

absorption) and the intensification of the peaks in 3450 cm
-1 

(O-H 

stretch; indicating the sulfenic acid formation) and 1640 cm
-1

 (C=C 

stretch; evidencing the alkene formation).

The oxidation process resulted in a significant increase of the 

polymers melting temperature (Tm) from 73 ºC to around 132 °C (Figure 

35). Both methods, oxidation in solution (S-OXI) or latex (L-OXI), 

presented similar results, corroborating the success of the oxidation 



86 

 

process for the nanoparticles in aqueous miniemulsion. In addition, it 

can be noticed that oxidized polymers presented broader peaks in 

comparison to the sample before oxidation; such behavior is attributed 

for the recrystallization of different crystal forms in polar polymeric 

materials (VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013).

oxidized in solid form (S-OXI) and latex (L-OXI). 
 

 
 

As expected, all the oxidized polymeric samples were no longer 

soluble in any solvent tested, including THF; therefore, it was not 

possible to determine their molecular weights by GPC. Moreover, other 

analyses, such as tensile testing and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), 

must be performed in future works for further characterization of the 

obtained polymers and biocompatibility and cytotoxicity tests of the 

modified nanoparticles should be evaluated for future biomedical 

applications.  
 

5.4 CONCLUSION 
 

Herein, poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles, previously obtained 

through thiol-ene reactions in miniemulsion, were modified by post-

polymerization oxidation of the thioether groups. A well-established 

process to oxidize the sulfur atom was performed using a hydrogen 

peroxide solution. For comparison of the results, the polymeric samples 



87 

 

were submitted to oxidation in latex and solution forms. FTIR 

measurements assured the appearance of sulfoxide and sulfone groups 

after the oxidation and TGA-analyses showed a thermal instability 

around 250 ºC, which was attributed to the sulfoxide groups and 

confirmed by FTIR. The melting temperature (Tm) of the oxidized 

polymers increased to 132 ºC and broader melting peaks were observed, 

probably due to the recrystallization of different crystals in polar 

polymeric materials. In addition, the size/dispersion stability and 

morphology of the nanoparticles after oxidation was confirmed by DLS 

and TEM images. Lastly, oxidized nanoparticles obtained herein present 

high potential for the release of bioactive compounds and, therefore, 

biocompatibility/cytotoxicity analyses should be performed for future 

biomedical applications.

CHAPTER VI 

6 CITOTOXICITY AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF THE 
POLY(THIOETHER-ESTER) NANOPARTICLES 

 

6.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Polymeric nanoparticles have been earning significant attention 

as drug carriers due to many advantages, such as protective effect 

against drug degradation, controlled or sustained release, possibility of 

drug delivery within the target tissue, and reduction of side effects (DE 

JONG; BORM, 2008; FELICE et al., 2014; FEUSER et al., 2016). In 
this field, miniemulsion polymerization allows the synthesis of 

polymeric NPs with unique characteristics and great commercial 

interest, with the possibility of using and/or incorporating drugs with 

low solubility in the continuous phase for a wide range of applications. 

Furthermore, miniemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique and 

presents some attractive advantages such as easier temperature control 

and radical compartmentalization inside the polymer particles 

(promoting high polymerization rates and allowing to obtain high 

molecular weight polymers) (EL-AASSER; MILLER, 1997; ASUA, 

2002; ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; SCHORK et al., 2005; 
CARDOSO; ARAUJO; SAYER, 2013).  

In this context, biobased polymers obtained from vegetable oils 

present potential biodegradability and biocompatibility, allowing their 

application for biomedical purposes. Thiol-ene reactions appear as 

successful and versatile techniques to obtain high molecular weight 

polymers from renewable raw materials, affording products with 

improved mechanical properties, unique crosslinking structure and 

tunable degradability behavior (KADE; BURKE; HAWKER, 2010; 

HOYLE; LOWE; BOWMAN, 2010). In addition, thiol-ene reactions 

allow the synthesis of polyesters in aqueous dispersed medium and 

thereby are suitable for the production of polymeric nanoparticles 

containing ester groups in the main chain, which can undergo 

hydrolysis, allowing their degradation in physiological environment, 

which is of great importance for biomedical applications or material 

disposal (JASINSKI et al., 2014). However, little attention has been 

paid to the synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers 

through thiol-ene polymerization. Studies regarding the use of thiol-ene 

based polymeric nanoparticles in the biomedical field, portraying 



90 

 

biocompatibility and biodegradation, are still underexplored (ZOU et 

al., 2011; MACHADO; SAYER; ARAÚJO, 2016).  

Thereby, the goal of this study was to characterize the biobased 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles synthesized in Chapter IV, focusing 

on future biomedical applications. Biocompatibility assays were 

performed in murine fibroblast (L929) cells and human cervical cancer 

cells (HeLa). Morphological analyses of the cells were carried out by 

inverted microscopy. Additionally, the effect of the nanoparticles in 

normal red blood cells (RBC) was verified by hemolysis assay. 

 

6.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 

6.2.1 Biocompatibility assay on L929 (murine fibroblast) cells 
 

The L929 cell lines were selected to evaluate cytotoxicity as a 

direct contact test, as recommended by ISO 10993 for in vitro toxicity. 
The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium 

(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 

units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and 4 mM/L of glutamine at 

37 °C in tissue culture flasks with 5 % CO2. For experimental purposes, 

trypsinized cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1x10
4
 cells plated 

in a 96-well flat bottom culture plate. For the cytotoxicity study, the 

cells were incubated for 24 h (5% CO2, 37 °C) in five different 

concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 µg/mL) of the polymeric 

nanoparticles (PTEE-N) dispersed in PBS 7.4. After 24 h of incubation 

the nanoparticles were washed three times with PBS (phosphate 

buffered saline) and cell viability was assessed using the classical MTT 

assay (Sigma, MO, USA). 

 

6.2.2 Cytotoxicity assay on HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) 
 

HeLa cell lines were obtained from the Adolfo Lutz Institute (São 

Paulo). HeLa cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) 

containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C in a 

humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The HeLa cells were seeded 

at 1x10
4 
cells/well in a 96-well flat bottom culture plate. After 24 h, the 

cells were incubated with a medium containing polymeric nanoparticles 

(PTEE-N) dispersed in PBS 7.4 at five concentrations: 25, 50, 75, 100 

and 200 µg/mL (5% CO2, 37 °C). After 24 h of incubation the cells were 

washed three times with PBS (7.4) and the MTT cell viability assay was 



91 

 

performed.  The cytotoxicity assay was carried out in triplicate, with 

three wells for each condition. 

 

6.2.3 MTT viability assay 
 

The MTT cell proliferation assay was employed to assess cell 

viability after both cytotoxic assays. Briefly, 200 ?L aliquots of MTT 

solution (5 mg.mL
?1

) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h 

(37 °C and 5% CO2), to allow the formazan-formation reaction. 

Following incubation, the medium containing the MTT solution was 

removed and the formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The 

absorbance was measured at 550 nm using an Infinite 200 TECAN 

microplate reader. The results are presented as survival percentage 

(100%), where the control group contained 1% DMSO (v/v). 

 

6.2.4 Morphological analyses 
 

Morphological analyses, consistent with observation of changes 

in cells morphology, were carried out by inverted microscopy (40X). 

Cells were incubated with poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles (PTEE-N) 

at the concentration of 50 µg/mL. As negative controls, cells were 

analyzed without incubation (control group). The morphological 

changes of the cells were observed 24 h after the incubation. 
 

6.2.5 Hemolysis Assay 
 

In order to analyze the effect of nanoparticles in normal red blood 

cells (RBC), five human blood samples were collected according to the 

ethics committee requirements (CEPSH n° 913/2010). Briefly, 4 mL of 

whole blood was added to 8 mL of a sterile solution of sodium chloride 

in water (saline) and the RBCs were isolated from serum by 

centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min.  The RBCs were further washed 

five times with saline solution, after that, the RBCs were diluted in 2 mL 

of saline solution. Then 120 µL of the diluted RBC suspension was 

added to 880 µL of water or saline. Samples were incubated with 

polysulfone nanoparticles (PS-N) at a concentration of 50, 100 and 

200 µg/mL. All samples were prepared in triplicate and the suspension 

was briefly vortexed before undergoing a gentle stirring at 37 °C for 

60 min. Afterwards, the mixture was briefly vortexed again and 

centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 5 min. 100 ?L of supernatant was 

transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance value of hemoglobin at 



92 

 

570 nm was measured with the reference wavelength at 540 nm. 120 µL 

of the diluted RBC suspension incubated with 880 µL of water and 

saline were used as the positive and negative control, respectively 

(WANG et al., 2009; YU; MALUGIN; GHANDEHARI; 2011). 

Hemolysis percentage was calculated according to Eq. 1: 
 

????????? (%) =
Sample absorbance?negative control

positive control?negative control
 ? 100                         Eq. (1) 

 

6.2.6 Statistical analysis 
 

Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three 

determinations. One-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc 

test were used to compare the cytotoxicity of the samples at different 

concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical 

Package for Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS Inc. version 13.0, 

USA). The statistical significance level was set at p &amp;lt;0.05 for all 

analyses.  
 

6.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

Cytotoxic effects of the synthesized poly(thioether-ester) 

nanoparticles (PTEE-N; Mini6 from Chapter IV) were evaluated by 

MTT assay on HeLa and L929 cells. Figure 36 and Figure 37 show the 

cytotoxicity profiles of HeLa and L929 cells, respectively, incubated 

with different concentrations of PTEE-N nanoparticles. It could be 

observed that the nanoparticles did not present any cytotoxic effect.

Additionally, Figure 38 shows that there were no significant 

changes in cell morphology after the incubation with PTEE-N 

nanoparticles on HeLa (a) and L929 (b) cells. The non-cytotoxicity of 

the L929 cells is an important factor; ISO 10993-5 recommends in vitro 

cytotoxicity assay of new materials for biomedical application. 

According to ISO 10993-5, cell viability &amp;lt;70% compared to untreated 

cells are considered cytotoxic (MADERUELO; ZARZUELO; LANAO, 

2011). Therefore, after the observed results, it can be said that 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles obtained in this work are 

biocompatibles.

Moreover, the impact of the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles 

(PTEE-N) on human red blood cells (RBCs) was evaluated by 

hemolysis assay (Figure 39). The quantification of hemoglobin in the 

supernatant of the nanoparticle-RBC mixture was done by recording the 

absorbance of hemoglobin at 540 nm. Treatments with 50 µg/L, 100 

µg/L and 200 µg/L were not able to cause hemolysis of RBCs, 



95 

 

suggesting that these systems do not have hemolytic capacity, even 

when administered at high concentrations. These results reveal that 

PTEE-N nanoparticles have high blood biocompatibility, making them a 

potential alternative to carry drugs intravenously.

nm. Data are mean ± SD (n = 3).  
 

 

 

        

 
6.4 CONCLUSION 

 

This work has demonstrated that the synthesized poly(thioether-

ester) nanoparticles (PTEE-N) derived from renewable resources did not 

present any cytotoxic effect in murine fibroblast cells (L929) and human

cervical cancer cells (HeLa). Also, it was observed no significant 

changes in cell morphology after the incubation with PTEE-N on HeLa 

and L929 cells, confirming the biocompatibility of the poly(thioether-

ester) nanoparticles and assuring their viability for biomedical purposes. 

In addition, hemolysis assays revealed that PTEE-N nanoparticles have 

high blood biocompatibility, making them a potential alternative as drug 

carrier systems for intravenous applications.

CHAPTER VII 

7 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

7.1 CONCLUSION 
 

In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a 100% 

renewable diene-diester monomer derived from 10-undecenoic acid (a 

castor oil derivative) and 1,3-propanediol (derived from glycerol) was 

reported. This green monomer was submitted to ADMET and thiol-ene 

polymerization reactions in miniemulsion aiming the development of 

biobased polymeric nanoparticles.  

ADMET reactions were successfully performed in miniemulsion 

and the obtained polymers achieved weight average molecular weight 

up to 14.7 kDa (Mn), depending on the catalyst and the surfactant 

employed. It was observed that the Ru-indenylidene catalyst (Umicore 

M2) presented higher activity in water by comparison to the Ru-

benzylidene catalysts (Grubbs 1
st
 and Hoveyda-Grubbs 2

nd
), 

corroborating previous results from the literature concerning the higher 

robustness of indenylidene catalysts. Additionally, the catalysts activity 

was significantly affected by the type of the surfactant, depending on its 

electronic charge. Moreover, ADMET reactions in miniemulsion 

favored the production of polymers with higher molecular weights than 

in bulk, probably because of the large surface area of the organic phase 

in miniemulsion, which causes the improvement of the ethylene removal 

from the reaction locus. 

Also, thiol-ene polymerization reactions in miniemulsion were 

successfully performed and poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles 

(confirmed by TEM analyses) were obtained from the fully renewable 

diene-diester monomer. Three different ?,?-diene monomers (1,7-

octadiene, 1,3-propylene dipent-1-enoate and 1,3-propylene diundec-10-

enoate) and two different dithiols (1,4-butanedithiol and 2-

mercaptoethyl ether) were tested and the results were compared. 

Reactions yielded polymers with number average molecular weight up 

to 15.3 kDa (Mn), depending on the comonomers employed and the 

initiator concentration. Moreover, the initiator AIBN presented an ideal 

concentration (1 mol %) to synthesize polymers with higher molecular 

weight, differing from the expected behavior in traditional free radical 

polymerization. Furthermore, the synthesized nanoparticles from 

renewable raw materials present properties (such as hydrolysable bonds 

in the polymeric main chain) that could enhance their degradability and, 



98 

 

therefore, the (bio) degradation of these particles will be investigated for 

future applications. 

Thereafter, the poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles were modified 

by a post-polymerization reaction using hydrogen peroxide in order to 

oxidize their sulfur atom to sulfoxide and sulfone groups. DLS and TEM 

images assured the stability of size/dispersion and morphology of the 

nanoparticles even after the oxidation process. FTIR and TGA analyses 

confirmed the presence of sulfoxide and sulfone groups after the 

oxidation. The melting temperature (Tm) of the oxidized polymers 

increased from 73 ºC to 132 ºC and broader melting peaks were 

observed, attributed to the recrystallization of different crystals in polar 

polymers.  

Finally, since the biobased polymeric nanoparticles obtained 

herein present high potential for the release of bioactive compounds, 

biocompatibility/cytotoxicity analyses were performed and results 

revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles did not present any cytotoxic 

effect and showed high blood biocompatibility, assuring their viability 

for biomedical purposes. 

 

7.2 FURTHER WORK 
 

? To synthesize other types of diene monomers from renewable 
resources; 

? To evaluate the effect of oxygen inhibition for ADMET reactions 
in miniemulsion;  

? To further investigate the kinetics of thiol-ene reactions, in order 
to explain the ideal concentration of AIBN for improved 

molecular weight; 

? To evaluate the (bio) degradation of the obtained poly(thioether-
ester) nanoparticles. Since they present ester groups in the main 

chain, the synthesized polymers are susceptible to hydrolysis 

(this work was already performed in our research group by 

HOELSCHER (2016)); 

? To finish tests concerning the biocompatibility of the synthesized 
nanoparticles (after oxidation) by evaluating hemocompatibility 

and in vitro cytotoxicity in fibroblast cells; 

? To encapsulate bioactive compounds via thiol-ene reactions for 
further biomedical applications.
