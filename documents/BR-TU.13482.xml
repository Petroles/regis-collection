ABSTRACT

The style of deformation of rocks from basin-infilling sequences in positively inverted natural basins was discussed

upon the results of laboratory experiments carried out in sandboxes with sand packs laid down in the space between

two wooden blocks. The space simulated stages of crustal extension leading to (1) a half graben due to extension above

a listric extensional detachment, with the blocks simulating the footwall and hanging wall, or (2) a graben, with the

blocks simulating the external margins that drifted apart above a horizontal detachment. Combinations of two different

angles were used to simulate the dip of curved normal faults along the internal face of the wooden blocks. Backstops in

the half graben had a convex up internal face. Backstops in the graben had a concave up internal face. Shortening was

partitioned in forward and backward movements within the sand packs, and the kinematics of contraction was largely

influenced by the convex or concave internal faces. A buttress effect characterized by rotation of the sand pack close to

the footwall was stronger for footwall with steeper-dipping internal faces. The results were compared to other physical

experiments and applied to an inverted basin found in nature.

Key words: analogue models, backstop geometry, buttress effect, inversion tectonics, normal detachment reactivation.

INTRODUCTION

The geometry and tectonic features of inverted basins

have been described since the beginning of the century.

However, the formal definition of ‘inversion’ was only

presented in 1981 by Glennie and Boegner (1981).

According to these authors, ‘inversion’ represents the

reversal of the regional stress regime, from extension

to contraction, or the opposite. Cooper et al. (1989) sug-

gest that the inversion process should involve: basin

formation by normal faulting, sedimentation and sub-

sequent compression or transpression causing uplift

and partial extrusion of the basin infill.

Inversion in orogenic belts involves deformation

of continental margin prisms and is normally character-

ized by thin- and thick-skinned thrust sheets and nappes.

This inversion style produces major crustal shortening

and was discussed by several authors dealing with fore-

land fold-thrust belts such as the Appalachians, the

Rocky Mountains, the Alps and the Himalayas (respec-

tively in Mitra 1988, de Graciansky et al. 1989, Hay-

ward and Graham 1989, Jadoon et al. 1994).

According to Glen et al. (2005), three different tec-

tonic models may be used to reproduce inversion: a)

the fault-reactivation model; b) the thin-skinned model;

and c) the buttress model. The first model postulates

that reactivation preferentially occurs along faults that

have the lowest dip angle or the lowest resistance to for-

ward movement. In the ‘thin-skinned model’, inversion

develops by the formation of new thrust faults rather

than by reactivation of pre-existent normal faults. Fi-

nally, in the ‘buttress model’, inversion is controlled by

the rheologic contrast between the basement and syn-

rift sedimentary sequences. According to Butler (1989)

and Hayward and Graham (1989), the basement, either

in the hanging wall or in the footwall of the extensional

detachment, may produce buttressing structures in the

syn-rift sequence either by folding and associated cleav-

ages, rotation in the foreland or backward propagating

displacements.

Despite several analogue experiments have demon-

strated how do structures progressively develop during

inversion, according to the fault-reactivation and the

thin-skinned models (respectively McClay 1995, 1989),

the buttress effect does not appear to have been conve-

niently addressed, and we think that the geometry of the

backstop may play a fundamental role in the deforma-

tion pattern of the basin infill, as well as in the reacti-

vation of the basal detachment. Thus, we carried out a

series of analogue experiments in sandboxes in order to

analyze the buttressing effects (rotation in the foreland

and/or backward propagating movement) and the con-

ditions of reactivation of the normal detachment. We

label as backstop the rigid mass that moves on the basal

detachment to cause contraction of the basin-infilling se-

quences, whereas the term buttress refers to a rigid mass

that restrains the dislocation of the thrust sheets. Both

the backstop and the buttress have the ability to sup-

port larger deviatoric stresses than the basin-infilling se-

quences.

In the evolution of orogenic wedges, backstops (or

indenters) have been described both in analogue (e.g.,

Mulugeta 1988, Bonini et al. 1999) and numerical

models (e.g., Byrne et al. 1993, Beaumont et al. 1994).

Byrne et al. (1993) consider a backstop as a structural

domain that bears strong differential stresses and gener-

ates a deformation front similar to a bulldozer pushing

from behind an accretionary wedge. According to these

authors, a backstop plays a key role in the geometry of an

accretionary wedge on a subduction zone. A foreland-

dipping backstop for instance causes, among other fea-

tures, the growth of a high outer arc and thrust vergence

inversion.

In our study, we described analogue models in

which the deformable hanging wall of a basin is inverted

by stiff, convex-up and concave-up backstops (Fig. 1).

The convex-up and concave-up geometries refer to the

curvature of the foreland-dipping face of the backstop

that is unconformably covered by the basin infill (Fig. 1i

and 1ii, respectively). The convex-up backstop simu-

lates the hanging wall block above a listric extensional

detachment (Fig. 1i); the concave-up backstop simu-

lates any of the two margins of a graben; in other words,

it is a block that can be moved on a horizontal detach-

ment (Fig. 1ii). In addition, we investigated the effect

of two different angles of dip for the foreland-dipping

face of the backstop and the rigid block (termed nor-

mal footwall block) on the style of deformation of the

basin infill.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTS

SCALING

For the analogue experiments to be valid, model pa-

rameters must be properly scaled. Hubbert (1937) es-

tablished scaling relationships between the geometric,

kinematic, and dynamic properties of the models and

the corresponding properties of the geological counter-

parts. The scale of model-prototypes is determined by

three basic parameters: length, time and mass. For geo-

metrically and kinematically similar structures, the dy-

namic similarity requires that the ratio between forces in

model and prototype must be constant if compared kind

to kind. From this condition follows another one: the

ratio between two dissimilar forces in the model must

be equal to the ratio between the same two forces in the

prototype. For our purpose, the most significant force

ratio is gravity force (Fg) / pressure force (Fp), written

as follows:

?l 3g /1? × l 2 or ?lg /1? (1)

where, ? = rock density, l = length, g = gravity on Earth

surface, and 1? = rock strength. From the above re-

quirement and expression (1) follows that

(
?lg/1?

)
model

=
(
?lg/1?

)
prototype

(2)

Once the density of the materials has little influence in

the solution of equations 1 and 2, and the gravity field

in experiments and nature is the same, equation 2 can be

rewritten as

(l/1? )model = (l/1? )prototype or

lmodel / lprototype = 1?model /1?prototype.

THE BACKSTOP SHAPE DURING BASIN INVERSION 999

active detachments along time. (1) basement; (2) syn-rift 1; (3) syn-rift 2; (4) convex-up backstop, and (5) concave-up backstop during inversion.

Thus, if the length in the model is decreased by a scale

factor ? = 10?5, the ratio of cohesive strength ?r must

be decreased also by 10?5. Equation 2 justifies the use

of dry sand as analogue material in several experiments,

because a reduction of the original by 100.000 times re-

quires that the analogue material has cohesive strength

close to zero.

The cohesive strength of sand has been subject of

discussion. A common method used to estimate the

strength of sand under low normal stresses consists of

a linearly extrapolation from measurements made at

higher values, yielding a wide range of results between

12 and 500 Pa. Eisenstadt and Sims (2005) noted that

the cohesive strength of sand is low but increases with

higher levels of ambient humidity. They evaluated sand

and clay models used to simulate deformation in brit-

tle rocks and concluded that neither is perfect for scaled

modeling, but both reproduce remarkably well the defor-

mation patterns of the upper crust. In our scaled models,

we selected quartz sand as analogue material due to its

ease of construction and dissection.

Sand is considered to behave as a Mohr-Coulomb

material similar to the upper brittle crust that implies a

friction angle of about 30? and a time-independent de-

formation. Therefore, the ratio between length and time

is an independent ratio, enabling us to choose a suitable

ratio for our experiments. The models were deformed

by displacing the mobile wall, driven by a motor, at a

rate of 2 × 10?3 cm/s (2 cm/h). The adopted scale fac-

tor was 10?5 and, consequently, a 5-cm height in the

model represented 5 km of brittle crust in the prototype.

EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

Our experiments were carried out at the Laboratory

of Tectonic Modelling of the Department of Geology,

Federal University of Ouro Preto (Brazil). During lab-

oratory work, 16 series of experiments were performed

in order to study the effect of mobile backstop curvature

on contraction and on positive inversion, with variable

initial lengths. Only the positive inversion deformation

experiments are presented and discussed here. In the

sandboxes, the space between the backstop and the nor-

mal footwall was filled with fine layers of sand of dif-

ferent colors (sand pack 1, Fig. 2). The models were

5 cm deep, 20 cm wide, and the initial length between

the rigid backstop toe and the rigid normal detachment

footwall toe was 14 cm. All experiments were run in

two successive steps. In the first step, 6 cm of exten-

sion (42.9%) was applied to the hanging wall with syn-

extension sedimentation (sand pack 2). At the end of

the extension, the top surface of the experiment was cov-

ered with an additional thin horizontal layer to visual-

ize the compressional deformation. In the second step,

the extensional basin was submitted to a 12-cm contrac-

tion (60%). Therefore, the final length between back-

stop and normal footwall toe was 8 cm.

quence 1 (in sequences 2 and 3 the backstop is concave-up and vertical,

respectively). (i) Apparatus before extension, and (ii) apparatus after

extension and before inversion. Sand pack 1 represents the rift infill

during the oldest extension event (also named syn-rift 1) (not simu-

lated), and sand pack 2 represents the syn-rift deposit of the second

extension event (also named syn-rift 2) – our first deformation step. ?

and ? are the backstop and the normal footwall cut-off angles, respec-

tively.

Three experimental sequences were set up, and in

two of them we changed the backstop curvature, from

convex upward (sequence 1) to concave upwards (se-

quence 2). In these sequences, the backstop cut-off an-

gle (?) and the normal footwall cut-off angle (?) were

either 60? or 70?, which are the angles usually found in

nature (models 1-8, Table I). Sequence 3 consisted of

two experiments (9 and 10) with a plane, vertical mobile

wall in order to compare the results with traditional ex-

periments (e.g., Buchanan and McClay 1991). In these

experiments, backstops were not characterized by any

specific lithology or geological body, and may be under-

stood as the result of lateral increase in strength com-

pared to the foreland.

For all experiments (Table I), the layers of colored

homogenous sand were deposited on a plastic sheet that

simulates a low friction basal detachment (normal de-

tachment D2; Fig. 2i). The plastic sheet overlays the

wooden normal footwall and passes under the backstop

where it was attached. Prior to inversion, the plastic

sheet was detached from the mobile wall, but remained

in the experimental box to simulate a possible reactiva-

tion of the normal detachment (detachment D2 = D3,

Fig. 2ii). Photographs that were taken through the trans-

parent sidewalls recorded the evolution of the structures

at regular intervals. In addition, at the end of the in-

version, the sand models were strengthened by infusion

with water, then cut and photographed. We observed that

friction between the sand and the glass sides caused a

minor slip of the fault-blocks at the sidewalls with re-

spect to the sand pack center. This means that the lateral

shear stress actually interferes with the model evolution,

but it does not modify the overall structural architecture.

EXPERIMENT LIMITATIONS

Because our experiments involve some simplifications,

they have limitations that require a critical analysis, such

as physical modelling experiments in general. A limita-

tion of our analogue experiments relates to the material

discontinuity between sand packs 1 and 2 and the wooden

blocks simulating the backstop and the normal footwall.

Sand packs 1 and 2 are mechanically equal. The physi-

cal discontinuity produced a mechanically defined basal

detachment that highly controlled the deformation tra-

jectory. In natural structures, fluid pressure may greatly

enhance reactivation by lowering resistance along the

fault zone. Cobbold et al. (2001) demonstrated that the

style of deformation in sandboxes could be partially con-

trolled by the amount of fluid pressure. However, pore

fluid pressure effects were not taken into account in our

experiments. We believe that the main potential of phys-

ical modelling is to provide a visual image of progressive

deformation under different combinations of controlling

parameters, while in the real world only the final defor-

mation product is available.

Finally, our experiments did not account for po-

tential thermal effects, compaction and isostatic adjust-

ment. Some other limitations involve constant extension

and convergence angle, and rate of deformation. In na-

ture, variations in both parameters may affect the geo-

metry of the structures and the mechanics involved in

their formation.

Our simplified approach is justified by the purpose

of providing basic guides for understanding inversion

tectonics when basin closure is caused by stiff, convex-

up and concave-up backstops.

RESULTS

For all experiments presented below, we described pro-

gressive deformation stages of one extensional experi-

ment (model 1) and two inversion models: one convex-

up (again model 1) and one concave-up (model 6) mo-

bile backstop sequence. In the other experiments we

focused only on the end results of inversion, which were

illustrated by cross-sections cut through the central re-

gion of the experiments.

EXTENSIONAL EXPERIMENT

The progressive extension in experiments with con-

vex-up backstop and dip angles of 60? resulted in a se-

quence of structures that compares well with the typical

sequence observed in physical experiments of extension

(McClay 1990). Characteristic features in sand pack 1

(syn-rift 1) are a gentle flexure in the hanging wall after

14,3% (2 cm) of extension (Fig. 3ii), and the successive

development of normal faults to form a crestal collapse

graben within the roll-over anticline (Figs. 3iii-iv). Two

antithetic (E1 and E2) and one syntethic (E3) normal

faults bounded the crestal collapse graben after 42,9% (6

cm) of extension.

The progressive extension with footwall block cut-

off angle ? = 70?, in experiments 3, 4, 7 and 8 (not

shown), produced at the final extension i) a crestal col-

lapse graben with a greater number of normal faults (up

to four), and ii) a higher counterclockwise rotation of

the syn-rift sand pack 1 close to the footwall.

INVERSION EXPERIMENTS WITH A CONVEX-UP

MOBILE BACKSTOP

Inversion steps – Model 1 (? and ? = 60?)

The successive stages of inversion are presented in Fig-

ure 4 (i to iv). After 20% of shortening (4 cm), a box

fold-type structure has developed next to the backstop

with limbs corresponding to a forethrust (F1) and a back-

thrust (B1). With the progressive deformation (40% =

8 cm), the sand wedge was pushed up and carried back-

ward (to the right) up the backthrust B1, and a second

forethrust (F2) developed when slip on forethrust F1

ceased.

After 60% of shortening (12 cm) (Fig. 4iv), the

box fold became an asymmetric ramp anticline onto the

convex-up backstop, because the compressional fault

system (F1 + F2) was carried up and backward relative

to the movement of the backstop. Such movement gave

origin to forethrust F3 that formed right at the toe of the

backstop and increased deformation of the crestal col-

lapse graben. The sand pack 2 (syn-rift 2) thickened

slightly nearby the footwall and started to be pushed up

and out of the half graben, but the basal detachment did

not reactivate. The crestal collapse graben fault system

was cut by forethrust 2 and 3 and underwent rotation and

narrowing (Fig. 4iv).

End results: Models 1 to 4

Figure 5 presents the profile line drawings of the cen-

tral region of models 1 to 4, at final shortening. In all

the experiments, at least three forethrusts cut the normal

faults in the foreland, and a major rotation of the crestal

collapse graben system occurred.

The main difference between models 1 and 3 (?

= 60?) and models 2 and 4 (? = 70?) concerns to the

deformation in the sand pack close to the backstop. In

the latter, the high backstop angle produced after 40%

of shortening (not shown) a second backthrust (B2) be-

low the first one. The difference between models 1 and 2

(? = 60?) and 3 and 4 (? = 70?) concerns to the amount

of counterclockwise rotation of the syn-rift sand pack 1

close to the footwall (Figs. 5 and 6i). Such rotation is

the greatest in experiment 4, in which the internal face of

both the normal footwall and the backstop dip steeply.

Reactivation of the normal detachment did not oc-

cur in any of the experiments, because the backstop geo-

metry allows an intense backward movement of the sand

wedge. Consequently, all profiles showed a ramp anti-

cline on the backstop, the hinges varying from rounded

(experiments 1 and 3) to flattened (experiments 2 and

4). Excepting experiment 1, both the backward displace-

ment (termed S) on the backstop flat and the ratio be-

tween S and the fold amplitude (A) were almost constant

(Figs. 7i and 8i).

INVERSION EXPERIMENTS WITH A CONCAVE-UP

MOBILE BACKSTOP

Inversion steps – Model 6 (? = 70? and ? = 60?)

The concave-up backstop caused a deformation trajec-

tory different from that observed for the convex-up back-

stop. Most of the deformation was accommodated by

the rise and backward movement of the sand wedge rel-

ative to the transport of the backstop, which produced

a pronounced ramp anticline (Fig. 9). After 20% of

shortening (4 cm), forethrust F1 appears (and backthrust

B1), and after 40% of shortening (8 cm), forethrust

F2 is formed together with a second backthrust (B2).

Thrust F2 cuts normal fault E1. After 50% of short-

ening (10 cm) (not shown), F2 becomes locked, and as

a consequence, the normal detachment is reactivated

(Fig. 9 iv). In this process, the crestal collapse graben

becomes narrower.

End results: Models 5 to 8

The line drawings of profiles across the center of ex-

periments 5 to 8 are presented in figure 10. Due to the

larger area between the two wooden blocks, the move-

ment of the concave-up backstops produces a less intense

deformation in this sequence. Rotation of the crestal col-

lapse graben system is small, and with the exception of

model 8, only two thrust faults are observed. Backthrusts

formed at the right side of the model. In model 8, fore-

thrust F3 extends to the syn-rift sand pack 2 cutting the

normal fault E3 after a short dislocation parallel to it.

Close to fault F3, two backthrusts of minor expression

are formed at the base of the sand wedge.

inversion experiments with (i) a convex-up mobile backstop (models 1 to 4) and (ii) a concave-up mobile backstop (models 5 to 8). Experiments

with a steep-dipping normal detachment (? = 70?; experiments 3, 4, 7, and 8) produced greater counterclockwise rotation of the sand pack.

The difference between the results of experiments

5 and 6 (? = 60?) and experiments 7 and 8 (? = 70?)

concerns the reactivation of the normal detachment in

the former two and a bigger backward displacement in

the latter two (Figs. 10 and 7ii). As in the case of the

inversion experiment with a convex-up mobile backstop,

the steeper normal detachment cut-off angle in models 7

and 8 caused a pronounced counterclockwise rotation of

the syn-rift sand pack 1 (Fig. 6ii). Comparing the end

results of models 5 (? = 60? and ? = 60?) and 6 (? = 70?

and ? = 60?), different amounts of forethrusts slip and

normal detachment reactivation are depicted (Figs. 10i

and ii). Model 7 differs from model 8 in the deforma-

tion style: the backward displacement on backstop flat

is larger in model 7 (Fig. 7ii), and the number of faults

and respective dip slip is larger in model 8 (Fig. 10iv).

and two forethrusts (F1 and F2) formed. The progres-

sive deformation (not shown) started almost concomi-

tantly in the hinterland, the center and the foreland by

sand pack thickening close to the backstop, slight rota-

tion of the antithetic normal faults (clockwise) and nor-

mal detachment reactivation, respectively. Only after

40% of shortening, the forethrusts (F1 and F2) formed.

tical ejection of the sand pack when compared to the

vertical ejection observed in experiment 9 (a difference

of 0,4 mm, in Fig. 13). However, the increase in SPH

is not proportional to the increase in the BH. One fore-

thrust (F1) formed at the toe of the vertical backthrust.

the normal footwall toe, and a forethrust (F2) formed

beneath the crestal collapse graben, in the foreland.

DISCUSSION

COMPARISON AMONG THE RESULTS OF THE

EXPERIMENTS

In all models (1 to 10), 60% of shortening caused ver-

tical ejection associated with back and/or forward hori-

zontal extrusion. The sense of the horizontal displace-

ment depends on the morphology, dip angle and height

of the adjacent blocks, particularly of the backstop.

Figure 13 compares deformation in the 60?-dipping

footwall models (models 1, 5, 9 and 10) with the vari-

able geometry of the backstop at final shortening (60%).

The results reveal that all models with SPH = BH, in-

dependent of the backstop geometry, generated a back-

ward movement, and the magnitude of movement is con-

trolled by the backstop geometry. The backward move-

ment is smaller when the backstop is vertical, and big-

ger when concave. In both experiments with vertical

backstops (Figs. 13iii and iv), a strong normal detach-

ment reactivation is noticed (from 20% shortening on),

whereas in experiments with curved backstop, only the

models with concave-up backstop produced reactivation

(starting at 40% of shortening). Moreover, at the end of

the deformation, the height of the deformed sand pack

is almost the same in all experiments (Figs. 13i-iv), dif-

fering only in the back- and forward slip magnitudes.

It is important to stress out that none of the crestal col-

lapse graben normal faults underwent reactivation in our

models. Excepting models 5, 9 and 10, these faults are

transected by the forethrusts.

dipping footwall but with different backstop geometries for comparison

Finally, the models demonstrated that the combined

effect of the normal footwall stiffness and the high dip

angle (70?) of the bounding normal detachment causes

a buttress effect by rotation of the syn-rift pack close

to the extensional detachment (models 3, 4, 7 and 8).

Graphics in Figure 6 demonstrate that, in models 1, 2, 5

and 6 (? = 60?, Table I), the angle between layering in

the sand pack and the normal detachment (angle ? shown

in the inset of Fig. 6) stayed low during all the inversion

steps (between 29? and 34?), while in experiments 3, 4,

7, and 8 (? = 70?, Table I), the angle ? started close to

40?, and in models 4 and 8 the sand pack rotated coun-

terclockwise for nearly 10?.

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL MODELS

AND WITH A GEOLOGICAL EXAMPLE

The backstop

Mulugeta and Koyi (1987) and Gomes (1996) discussed

the effect of a vertical mobile wall on the compressive

structures in sand models. The vertical and stiff wall

causes strong ejection of the analogue material close to

the backstop, together with backthrusting and vertical-

ization of the older compressive faults as well, as a pro-

gressive decrease in the spacing between the thrust faults.

Rossetti et al. (2002), among others, studied, by

means of thermomechanical laboratory experiments,

the formation of accretionary wedges (traction-reversal

models) in subduction zones, varying the backstop geo-

metry and convergence velocities. The authors used vis-

cous paraffin (T ? 37?) to simulate the crust, and demon-

strated that the above factors controlled the position of

the axial ridge of the wedge and the propagation of the

deformation front.

Bonini et al. (1999) described physical sand mod-

els and demonstrated that indenters (or backstops) with

a low-angle (? 60?) ramp geometry cause upward and

backward movement of sand packs. Indenters with 60?-

dipping ramps cause the formation of isolated back-

thrusts, and in experiments with steeper ramp angles

(&gt; 60?), the backward movement occurs on backthrusts

rather than along the backstop. Continuous displace-

ment results in the formation of thrusts with double ver-

gence. Our experiments showed the same result solely

for concave-up backstops. Our experiment with con-

vex-up backstops generated different final results, with

backward rise initially occurring on a backthrust, as in

the experiments with &gt; 60?-ramp geometry reported by

Bonini et al. (1999). However, with the progressive de-

formation in our experiments, the more the backstop was

pushed forward, the more the backthrust got closer until

the backstop touched it. In the following steps of the

experiment, the sand pack rose in such a way that the

ascension seemed to occur along the backstop itself.

Field evidences of backward movement in inver-

sion tectonics environments are not common. In the

northern precambrian Espinhaço Basin, on the eastern

margin of the São Francisco Craton, Abad Posada (un-

published data) described an inversion process with reac-

tivation of normal detachments, buttressing effect (coun-

terclockwise rotation of the syn-rift pack) and backward

shearing along the eastern basement block (Fig. 14).

We noticed that, despite the absence of forethrusts, the

bulk deformation pattern in the cross-section of Figure

14, which was constrained on line-length balancing and

restoration to the horizontal, is in good agreement with

our experimental models with the concave-up backstops

(compare, for example, Figs. 14 and 10iv).

The fault reactivation

According to Brun and Nalpas (1996), sand models with

deformable footwall and hanging wall blocks require a

strike-slip component to the reactivation of preexisting

normal faults. Panien et al. (2005) demonstrated that in-

version achieved with deformable footwall and hanging

wall blocks produces forethrusts and backthrusts that cut

across extensional faults, whereas reactivation is a minor

process. Eisenstadt and Sims (2005) compared inversion

produced by dry sand and wet clay and concluded that,

independently of boundary conditions, the inversion in

analogue models is rheologically sensitive. Whilst in dry

sand models it causes essentially uplift by sets of conju-

gate thrusts and minor reactivation of pre-existent faults,

in wet clay models normal fault reactivation prevails re-

gardless of fault dip, probably due to high fluid pressure.

The results of our models are consistent with ana-

logue experiments of the ‘fault reactivation model’,

which show strong influence of rigid basement blocks

(e.g., McClay and Buchanan 1992, Buchanan and Mc-

Clay 1991). Our experimental set-up differs from that

of Buchanan and McClay (1991) by the shape of the

curved backstop geometry and by a smaller sand pack

thickness. Under their conditions, analogue models al-

ways produced reactivation of the main listric exten-

sional detachment and of the normal faults of the crestal

collapse graben. In addition, footwall shortcut thrusts

may be produced as well as hanging wall backthrusts

at the footwall toe. Our experiments demonstrated that

the backstop geometry exerts a strong control on the

normal detachment reactivation. We found that whilst

a concave-up backstop may generate reactivation from

40% of shortening on, a convex-up backstop does not

produce any normal detachment reactivation until 60%

of shortening.

The buttress

Our experimental models, performed with stiff normal

footwalls, produced counterclockwise rotation of the

syn-rift sequence in the contractional foreland due to the

presence of a 70?-dip normal detachment cut-off angle.

We presume that a 60?-dip normal footwall with a high

frictional basal detachment may produce the same result.

As with the backward movement, the buttress-ef-

fect is rarely described in inversion tectonics. Rotation

of the syn-rift pack was related to a buttress effect by de

Graciansky et al. (1989) along the Gourdan-Vial reverse

fault, in the Western Maritime Alps. Bailey et al. (2002)

studied the Tye River fault zone in the Appalachian Blue

Ridge Province and concluded that, during inversion, a

basement-cored extensional footwall acted as a buttress

and controlled folding in the cover sequence.

IMPLICATIONS

Backward movement in contractional environments is

commonly described as a buttress effect (the thrust-sheet

dislocation restrains due to a rigid mass in the foreland),

but as demonstrated by Bonini et al. (1999), it may de-

pend on the backstop geometry. Eisenstadt and Sims

(2005) call attention to the fact that, in sand models,

both in contraction and in inversion, regardless to the

boundary conditions, the shortening is accommodated

by sand pack rising bounded by a fore- and a backthrust.

Thus, our experimental models demonstrated that the

backstop geometry does not modify overall deformation

structures, but controls the predominant extrusion sense

and, as a consequence, the normal detachment reactiva-

tion.

The backstop height controls backward movement

versus vertical strain, but does not interfere in the forward

movement or reactivation of pre-existent normal detach-

ment. Finally, the comparison with Buchanan and Mc-

Clay’s (1991) experiments suggests that the reactivation

of pre-existent normal detachment is more dependent on

sand pack height than on backstop height.

CONCLUSION

In our analogue sand models that simulated the inver-
sion of a half-graben using stiff undeformable footwall
blocks and stiff backstops of different geometry, the fol-
lowing features were detected:

a) a convex-up backstop produces the ejection of the
sedimentary sequence to the hinterland, and un-
til 60% of shortening no reactivation of the exten-
sional detachment takes place;

b) a concave-up backstop also generates a strong ejec-
tion to the hinterland, but forward propagating
movement leading to detachment reactivation may
take place after 40% of shortening;

c) a vertical backstop, regardless to its height, pro-
duces normal detachment reactivation after 20% of
shortening;

d) a high (70?) normal detachment cut-off angle
causes pronounced rotation of the syn-rift sequence
in the inversional foreland.

The results suggest that the reactivation of a nor-
mal detachment in inversion tectonics is strongly influ-
enced by the backstop geometry. In the reactivation
process, the backstop height is a negligible factor. We
conclude that different backstop geometries may mod-
ify the common shortening process that is usually ac-
commodated by a pop-up type structure with equal slip
on fore- and backthrust. In addition, we conclude that a
stiff high angle footwall leads to a buttress effect in the
syn-rift sequence.

espaço entre dois blocos de madeira. O espaço simulava es-

tágios de extensão crustal que conduziram à formação de (1)

um hemi-graben, gerado sobre um descolamento basal lístrico,

com os blocos simulando o teto e o muro; e (2) um graben, com

os blocos representando as margens externas que se distancia-

ram ao longo de um descolamento horizontal. Combinações de

dois ângulos diferentes foram usadas para simular o mergulho

das falhas normais curvas ao longo da face interna dos blocos

de madeira. Nos hemi-grabens, os anteparos possuíam geome-

tria convexa, e, nos grabens, geometria côncava. No pacote de

areia, o encurtamento foi particionado em movimentos dirigi-

dos a pós e antepaís, e a cinemática da contração foi forte-

mente influenciada pela geometria convexa ou côncava das

faces internas dos anteparos. Um efeito obstáculo, caracteri-

zado por rotação do pacote de areia, próximo ao bloco do muro,

foi mais elevado junto às faces internas dos blocos de mais alto

ângulo de mergulho. Os resultados foram comparados a outros

experimentos físicos e aplicados a uma bacia invertida encon-

trada na natureza.
