ABSTRACT. The purpose of this paper is to present the first data concerning the diet of  Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana, an abundant deep-water predator off Southeastern and Southern Brazilian coast. The diet of
A. edwardsiana is composed mainly of benthic and benthopelagic organisms. Crustaceans were the most
important prey item in the diet, followed by sediment, fishes, cephalopods, anthozoans, polychaetes, and
echinoderms.  A redundancy  analysis  (RDA)  was  used  to  assess  the  relative  importance  of  different
environmental  and  biological  variables  influencing  the  feeding  habits  of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana.
Cephalopods are mostly ingested during the spring, inversely, sediment was more important during the
summer. Fishes are preferentially ingested by large and sexually mature individuals, while anthozoans are
preferred by small individuals. Espiríto-Santo coast presented more individuals that prefer to eat more
sediment than fishes or cephalopods. The majority of the stomachs were moderately empty or moderately
full  and  few  stomachs  were  full  or  very  full.  Significant  differences  were  found  in  the  percentage  of
stomach  fullness  between  sex,  size  and  female  maturation.  Males,  small  individuals  and  immature
females had the highest values of stomach fullness.  The variation in diet appears to be related to gonad
development, driving temporal changes in feeding strategy.

RESUMO. Hábitos  alimentares  do  camarão-de-profundidade  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana (Johnson
1867)  (DECAPODA: ARISTEIDAE) na costa Sudeste e Sul do Brasil. O Objetivo deste trabalho é
apresentar  os  primeiros  dados  no  que  concerne  à  dieta  de  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana,  um  abundante
predador de águas profundas da costa Sul e Sudeste brasileira. A dieta de  A. edwardsiana é composta
principalmente por organismos bentônicos e bentôpelágicos. Os crustáceos foram o mais importante item
da  dieta,  seguido  por  sedimentos,  peixes,  cefalópodes,  antozoários,  poliquetas  e  equinodermos.  Foi
realizada uma análise de redundância (RDA) para verificar a importância relativa das diferentes variáveis
que  influenciam  o  hábito  alimentar  de  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana.  Os  cefalópodes  são  principalmente
ingeridos durante a primavera, inversamente, sedimentos são mais importantes durante o verão. Os peixes
são preferencialmente ingeridos por indivíduos maiores e sexualmente maturos, enquanto os antozoários
são preferência dos pequenos indivíduos. A costa do Espiríto-Santo apresentou indivíduos que preferem
comer mais sedimentos que peixes ou cefalópodes. A maioria dos estômagos estavam moderadamente
vazios ou moderadamente cheios e poucos estômagos estavam cheios ou muito cheios. Foi encontrada
diferença estatística na plenitude estomacal entre sexo, tamanho e estágio de maturação das fêmeas. Os
machos, pequenos indivíduos e fêmeas possuíram estômagos mais cheios. A variação na dieta parece estar
relacionada com o desenvolvimento gonadal, levando a alterações temporais na estratégia alimentar.

Introduction
Five species of three genera from Aristeidae

family (Aristeus, Aristeaeopsis and Aristaeomorpha)
are  valuable resources  in many  parts  of the  world,
supporting  important  commercial  fisheries,
especially  in  Europe  (Belcari  et  al.  2003).  In
Brazilian  waters  these  deep-sea  shrimps,
Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  (Johnson  1867),
Aristaeomorpha  foliacea,  and  Aristaeus  antillensis
have  become  valuable  targets  of  the  Brazilian
deep-water  trawling  fishery  as  a  result  of  a
government  support  to  exploit  fishery  resources  in
areas of the continental slope (Pezzuto  et al.  2006).
Aristaeopsis edwardsiana  is the main component of
the  catches,  comprising  88.4%  of  the  total  shrimp
production  conducted  by  chartered  trawlers  off
Brazilian coast between 2000 and 2004 (Pezzuto  et
al. 2006). Also known as “carabineiro” or the scarlet
shrimp,  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  is  predominantly
a  deep-water  species,  and  is  often  found  at  depths
between  400  and  900  m  (D’Incao 1998),  however,
most of the catch is restricted to depths between 700
and 750 m (Pezzuto et al. 2006). 

Lagardère (1972) and Rainer (1992) studied the
diet of A. edwardsiana along the coasts of Morocco
and Australia,  respectively, and  recorded  a  diverse
diet  for  this  species,  mostly  composed  of  fishes,
crustaceans, and squids. The diet and feeding habits
of  other  aristeid  shrimps,  such  as  Aristaeomorpha
foliacea  and  Aristeus  antennatus,  have  been
extensively studied (Chartosia et al. 2005,  Cartes et
al. 2008 Kapiris  et  al.  2010,  Nouar  et  al.  2011).
Aristeids  are  among  the  megabenthic  predators
whose  diet  is  composed  of  a  wide  variety  of
organisms  (i.e.  benthic  and  zooplanktonic
crustaceans;  mobile  prey,  such  as  fishes  or
cephalopods;  detritus;  echinoderms;  and
polychaetes),  being important  in  the trophic  chains
of  deep-sea  communities  (Cartes  1994,  Cartes  &amp;amp;
Carrassón 2004, Kapiris et al. 2010). 

Trophic relationships is an important approach
for understanding the organization of communities,
as  interactions  with  biological  and  environmental
variables can influence the choice of food resources
exploited  by  species,  like  changes  in  feeding
strategy  related  to  sexual  development  (Kapiris  &amp;amp;
Thessalou-Legaki 2011, Kapiris 2012). Additionally,
many deep-sea species shows feeding patterns that is
related with the temporal and seasonal distributions
of their prey (Gartner et al, 1997). However, there is
a lack of studies on the feeding habitats of aristeid
shrimps in Brazilian coastal waters. The aim of the
present study was to provide a first description of the

diet  and  feeding  habits  and  to  assess  the  relative
importance of different environmental and biological
variables  influencing  the  feeding  habits  of
Aristaeopsis edwardsiana inhabiting the continental
slope of the southeastern and southern sectors of the
Brazilian coast.

Methods
The  shrimps  were  collected  by  observers

aboard  commercial  vessels  that  operated  on  the
continental slope off the Southeastern and Southern
Brazilian coasts (18°S-28°S, 665-766 m deep) (Fig.
1)  between  February  2003  and  January  2007.  The
study  area  was  subdivided  into  three  regions:  the
Espírito Santo coast (18°S-21°S), the Rio de Janeiro
-  São  Paulo  coast  (23°S-25°S),  and  the  Paraná  -
Santa  Catarina  coast  (26°S-27°S).  The  Espírito
Santo coast is known to possess diverse background
morphology,  with  the  presence  of  significant
submarine  canyons  and  a  series  of  protuberances
(cones  and  plateaus)  between  100  and  1000  m  in
depth; however, the regions of the Rio de Janeiro  -
São  Paulo  coast  and  the  Paraná  -  Santa  Catarina
coast are less irregular (MMA, 2006). 

Data on the position, date, hour, depth (m) of
each  trawl  were  recorded.  After  each  tow,  the
stomachs were fixed in formalin (10%) and stored in
70% alcohol  to keep preserved and enable a better
manipulation.  Sex  was determined  macroscopically
by  the  presence  of  a  petasma  in  males  and  a
thelycum  in  females.  Carapace  length  (CL)  was
measured  (accuracy,  1  mm)  from  the  orbit  to  the
dorsal  mid-point  of  the  posterior  margin  of  the
carapace  using  sliding  calipers.  Males  were
classified  according  to  maturation  stage:  terminal
ampullae  empty  (immature)  or  filled  with  sperm
(mature)  (Sardà  &amp;amp;  Demestre  1989).  Females  were
classified according presence (impregnated; mature)
or  absence  (not  impregnated;  imature)  of
spermatophores  plugged  in  their  telicum  (Sardá  &amp;amp;
Demestre  1989) and to a  macroscopic examination
of  the  gonads:  I-immature,  translucent  ovary;
II-incipient maturity, orange ovarian; and III-mature,
brown  ovary  (Guéguen  1998).  The  percentage  of
stomach  fullness  (%SF)  was  estimated  as  %SF  =
(SWW/BWW)  *  100,  where  SWW is  the  stomach
(with  contents)  wet  weight  (g)  and  BWW  is  the
shrimp  body  wet  weight  (g)  (Héroux  &amp;amp;  Magnan
1996).  One-way  ANOVA was  used  to verify if the
percentage  of  stomach fullness  varied according  to
sex,  size,  season,  maturation  stage,  and  area.  The
data  were  transformed  (log10(x+1))  to  satisfy  the
assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.

Feeding habits of Aristaeopsis edwardsiana 169

Figure 1. Study area, Southeastern and Southern regions of the Brazilian coast, with emphasis on the continental slope
between  500  m  and  1000  m  depth,  and  latitudinal  limits  of  the  fishing  sectors  of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana.  Dots
represent the locations of capture.

The statistical package used was Statistica 7.0. The
degree of stomach fullness was estimated based on
the highest value of %SF, which was considered as
100%  full,  resulting  in  the  following  classes:  very
full  (&lt;100%  and  &gt;75%),  full  (&lt;75%  and  &gt;50%),
moderately  full  (&lt;50%  and  &gt;25%),  moderately
empty (&lt;25%), and empty (&lt;1%). Exceptions were
stomachs  with  no  contents,  which  were  visually
classified  as  empty.  Tukey's  Multiple  Range  Test
was  used  to  determine  significant  differences
between group means.

The  food  items  were  examined  under  a
stereoscopic microscope and identified to the lowest
taxonomic level possible. The quantification of food
items was performed using two methods: the relative
frequency  of  occurrence  and  the  points  method
(Williams 1981,  Wear &amp;amp; Haddon 1987). The index
of  food  importance  (IAi)  (Kawakami  &amp;amp;  Vazzoler
1980)  was  also  used  as  a  complementary  index  to

indicate  the  relative  importance  of  certain  food
categories.

The  diet  composition  was  summarized  by  the
relative frequency of occurrence of the food item i
(FO%) and was calculated as the ratio between the
number of stomachs containing a food item i (FO)
and the total number of stomachs with food content
(n):

??

FO% ? (FO ? n) ? 100  
(Williams  1981).  Empty  stomachs  were  eliminated
from this analysis. The relative contribution of each
food item i (RCi) in a stomach was evaluated by the
points method,  and was subjectively classified into
five  categories:  0-5%  =  2.5  points,  5.1-35%  =  25
points, 35.1-65% = 50 points, 65.1-95% = 75 points,
and  95.1-100%  =  100  points.  Further,  RCi  was
weighted  according  to  the  degree  of  fullness  of
stomachs  in  which  a  food  item  i  was  found,  as
follows:  moderately  empty,  0.25;  moderately  full,

0.5; full, 0.75; and very full, 1.00 (Wear &amp;amp; Haddon
1987).  This  resulted  in  the  absolute  frequency  of
points  for  a  food  item  i  found  in  the  foregut  j
(PFaij). The relative frequency of points (FP%) of a
food item was estimated as

where  A is  the  total  number  of  points  for  all  food
items found in all stomachs, aij is the total number
of points found for the item i in all stomachs, and n
is the number of stomachs (Williams 1981).

Multivariate analysis was used to determine the
relationships  between  the  diet  composition  and
biological  and  environmental  variables  (sex,  size,
season, male and female maturation stage, and area).
A  detrended  correspondence  analysis  (DCA)
revealed that the ordination axes were smaller than
one and a  half standard  deviations,  suggesting that
redundancy analysis (RDA) was the proper method
to  relate  two  sets  of  variables. The  inflation  factor
calculated during RDA showed that the variable sex
presented high collienarity. Strong collinearity may
affect  the  ability  to  correctly  estimate  model
parameters, therefore dataset was reduced by leaving
out  the  sex  (Legendre  &amp;amp;  Legendre  1998).  The
statistical  significance  of  the  variables  extracted
from  the  RDA  was  estimated  by  a  Monte  Carlo
permutation  test  (1000  simulations)  (Lepš  &amp;amp;
Šmilauer 2003). As in Magnan et al. (1994) a cut-off
point of p=0.10 was used in this routine.

Results
The  most  conspicuous  components  of  the  diet

of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  were  sediment,
carapaces of crustaceans and molluscs shells, corals,
sponge  spicules,  hard  parts  of  cephalopods  (beaks,
sucker rings,  sucker hooks,  and eye-lens),  and  fish
vertebrae.  Items  that  could  not  be  identified  were
classified as undetermined organic matter (UOM). 

According  to  the  ranking  of  IAi,  crustaceans
were the main prey item in the diet of Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana,  followed  by  sediment,  fishes,
cephalopods,  anthozoans,  polychaetes,  and
echinoderms  (Table  I;  Fig.  2).  The  ranking  of  the
frequency of occurrence was in agreement with the
ranking  of  IAi  for  most  food  items,  with  the
exception  of  cephalopods,  which  have  a  greater
frequency of occurrence than the fishes.

The  items  such  as  porifera  spicules,
foraminiferans,  and  shells  of  bivalves  and
gastropods  (all  around  1  mm)  were  considered  as

incidental prey, because we assumed that these items
were passively ingested along with the substratum.
This  conclusion  was  based  on  the  fact  that  such
items were recorded mainly in stomachs containing
large  quantities  of  sediment.  Plastic  intake  was
observed in stomachs filled with various food items,
indicating incidental ingestion (Rezende et al. 2011).

The carapace length ranged from 26.80 to 99.30
mm  in  females  (128  females  examined)  and  from
31.35 to 69.45 mm  in males (98 males examined).
For statistical analyzes four size classes were used:&amp;lt;
49.9  mm;  50-64.9  mm,  65-79.9  mm,  &gt;80  mm.  A
total  of  226  individuals  were  analysed,  table  II
summarize  the  number  of  individuals  for  each
variable examined.

The  RDA performed  shows  that  spring,  small
individual (&gt; 50 mm), impregnate females, summer
and  Espiríto  Santo  coast  are  the  most  important
environmental  variables  (p  &amp;lt; 0.10)  influencing  the
diet  composition  (Table  III,  Fig.  3).  The  forward
selection  procedure  has  not  retained  the  remaining
variables.  However,  the  non-significant  variables
were included in the final ordination diagram of the
RDA due to their importance in explaining the diet
variations.  The  first  two  RDA  ordination  axes
account for 81.8 % of total variance.

According  to  RDA  graph  (Fig.  3)  it  was
possible  to  observe  that  during  spring  cephalopods
were the most important item and sediment seems to
have  little  importance.  However,  in  summer  the
opposite takes place, with shrimps feeding mostly on
sediment.  As  females  become  mature  (impregnate
and stage III of gonad development), fishes become
more  important,  while  immature  individuals  ingest
more  sediment.  Yet,  small  individuals  prefer
anthozoans and sediments, and large shrimps prefer
cephalopods  and  fishes.  Regarding  to  the  area,  the
individuals  captured  from  the  Espírito  Santo  coast
consumed  more  sediment  and  fewer  fishes  and
cephalopods than the individuals captured from the
Rio  de  Janeiro  -  São  Paulo  and  Paraná  -  Santa
Catarina coasts.

The  highest  value  of  percentage  stomach
fullness  (%SF)  found  in  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana
was 5.95%, and this value corresponded to a 100%
full  stomach.  Of  the  202  individuals  analysed,  10
had their  degree  of  fullness  visually determined as
empty. According  to  the  degree  of  fullness,  it  was
observed  that  the  majority  of  the  stomachs  were
moderately empty (63.4%), followed by moderately
full  (24.3%).  A  few  stomachs  were  between  full
(3.9%)  and  very  full  (1.9%),  whereas  empty
stomachs were present in 6% of individuals.

According  to  the  one-way  ANOVA  results,
significant differences were found in the percentage
of  stomach  fullness  between  sex,  size  and  female
maturation  (Table  IV).  Relating  the  percentage  of
stomach  fullness  values  to  the  degree  of  fullness
classes,  all  variables  presented,  on  average,
moderately  empty  stomachs.  Males,  small
individuals (&amp;lt;50mm and 50-65 mm) and immature
females had the highest values of stomach fullness.
While,  females,  large  individuals  (65-80  mm  and
&gt;80 mm) and mature females presented less stomach
fullness (Fig. 4). 

Discussion
In  Brazilian  waters,  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana

has  a  diet  similar  to  that  previously  to  aristeid
shrimps.  Lagardère  (1972)  and  Rainer  (1992)
recorded a similar diet for this species. The diet of
two  other  species  of  aristeid  shrimps,  Aristeus
antennatus and  Aristaemorpha  foliacea, is  also
mainly  composed  of  crustaceans,  fishes,  and
cephalopods,  with  some  quantities  of  polychaetes,
echinoderms, gastropods, and bivalves (Chartosia et
al. 2005). 

The stomach contents recorded in  Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana  usually  contained  only  hard  parts
highly fragmented. Lagardère (1972) also point out
this problem, saying that the species grind their food
and ingest  only small  fragments. Since the state of
preys most of the items could only be identified at a
higher taxonomic level. The retention time for these
is likely to be greater than that for soft tissues, which
could explain why soft tissues and other prey items
were not frequently found in the low-level digestion
conditions. 

It  was  not  possible  to  provide  more  precise
information  about  the  habitat  of  the  prey,  i.e.
whether  they  are  pelagic  or  benthic.  However,  the
high  frequency  of  occurrence  of  fishes  and
cephalopods  in  the  diet,  in  addition  to  the
morphological  characteristics  of  Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana,  such  as  light  exoskeletons  and  long
pleopods,  suggesting  good  swimming  ability
(Guéguen 1997), is evidence that the specie feeds on
pelagic forms. As well as on benthic forms, by the
frequent occurrence of sediment, anthozoa and other
benthic forms depending of the life time.

Since cephalopods, fishes, and some crustacean
species have great swimming ability, the presence of
these  items  in  the  stomach  contents  may  indicate
that  these deep-sea shrimps are effective predators.
Bello  &amp;amp;  Pipitone  (2002)  have  pointed  out  that
Aristeomorpha foliacea fed on small and very small
specimens of cephalopods, including early juveniles,
and  that  the  prey  size  was  found  to  be  positively
correlated  with  shrimp  size.  However, a  pattern  of
mass  spawning,  followed  by  the  death  of  the
spawners, is known in many cephalopods (Boyle &amp;amp;
Rodhouse, 2005). This indicates that it is likely that
the  consumption  of  demersal  decapods  is  achieved
by feeding on dead or dying cephalopods. 

Comparison of diet composition of this species on
the  Brazilian  coast  reveals  that  this  shrimp  species
undergoes changes in feeding habits with increasing body
size.  With  an  increase  in  size,  individuals  cease  to
consume sediment and anthozoans, and switch their diet
to  larger  and  more  energetic  prey, such  as  fishes  and
cephalopods. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were also apparent
in Aristaeomorpha foliacea, despite high dietary overlaps
among  small,  medium,  and  large  females.  Large
individuals,  who  are  more  efficient  predators,  selected
highly  mobile  prey  (e.g.  fishes),  whereas  small
individuals consumed low-mobility prey (e.g. copepods,
ostracods, tanaids, and sipunculans) (Kapiris et al. 2010). 

In  aristeid  shrimps,  sexual  and  ontogenetic
segregation  have  been  observed  along  different
bathymetric gradients, in which the largest catch of
mature  spawning  females  occurs  along  the  open
slope,  and  juveniles  and  males  are  caught  in
abundance near the canyons (Sardà &amp;amp; Cartes 1993,
Sardà  et  al.  1994,  Relini  et  al. 1999,  Tudela  et  al.
2003).  This  ontogenetic  and  sexual  segregation
could  explain  the  difference  found  in  the  diet
between the individuals of the Espírito Santo coast,
Rio de Janeiro - São Paulo coast, and Paraná - Santa
Catarina  coast.  Additionally,  it  was  observed  that
along  the  Espírito  Santo  coast,  of  the  females
captured,  only 6% were mature,  whereas along the
Rio de Janeiro  -  São Paulo  coast  and  the Paraná  -
Santa  Catarina  coast,  17%  and  20%  of  captured
females,  respectively,  were  mature.  A diet  rich  in
fish  and  cephalopods,  appropriate  for  mature
females, was found in the stomachs of the shrimps
along  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  -  São  Paulo  coast  and
Paraná - Santa Catarina coast,  where we found the
greatest  abundance  of  mature  females.  However,
there are no previous studies in the area that attest
this  hypothesis.  Seasons  have  an  influence  on  the
diet of the deep-sea megafauna, and this is possibly
related  to  the  period  of  highest  abundance  of  each
prey group in the environment (Cartes 1994, Fanelli
&amp;amp; Cartes 2008).

Feeding habits of Aristaeopsis edwardsiana 175

Figure  4. Percentage  of  stomach  fullness  (%SF)  by  sex  (A),  size  (B)  and  female  maturation  of  Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana classified according to a macroscopic examination of the gonads (C) and the presence (impregnated) or
absence  (not  impregnated)  of  spermatophores  plugged  in  their  telicum  (D).  The  vertical  bars  indicate  the  95%
confidence interval, with the minimum and maximum values. 

However,  several  studies  have  shown  that
biological  processes,  such  as  gonad  development,
are also responsible for the seasonal patterns in the
diet  of  aristeids  (Cartes  et  al. 2008,  Kapiris  et  al.
2010, Nouar et al. 2011) During spring, RDA results
showed  that  the  ingestion  of  cephalopods  becomes
significant. Additionally, it was observed that higher
proportions  of  mature  females  of  Aristaeopsis
edwardsiana occur  in  Brazilian  waters  in  spring
(Pezzuto  &amp;amp;  Dias  2007,  Dias  2009).  These  facts
support the finding that the seasonal feeding habits
of  Aristaeopsis  edwardsiana  seem  to  be  related  to
reproduction. In shrimps maintained in captivity, the
value  of  several  food  items  for  maturation  and
reproduction is attributed to their cholesterol content
(Ravid  et  al. 1999,  Wouters  et  al. 2001,  Díaz  &amp;amp;
Fenucci  2004).  This  is  because,  like  most
invertebrates,  crustaceans  are  incapable  of
synthesizing cholesterol; thus these lipids need to be

ingested along with the food (Shmidt-Nielsen 2002).
Mendoza  et  al.  (1997)  showed  that  squid  is  a  rich
cholesterol source, and also contains sexual steroids
that trigger shrimp vitellogenesis.

For  aristeids,  many  authors  describe  higher
feeding activity (higher values of stomach fullness)
for  large  females,  explained  by  the  increased
metabolic  demands  at  the  beginning  of  oogenesis
(Maynou &amp;amp; Cartes 1998; Cartes et al. 2008, Kapiris
et al. 2010). This work found the opposite scenario,
in  which  males,  small  shrimps  and  immature
females  presented  higher  stomach  fullness  than
females,  large  shrimps,  and  mature  females.  We
believe this could be due to the high-level digestion
conditions  present  in  most  analyzed  stomach
contents,  which  can  interfere  with  the  accuracy  of
the analysis depending on the main item ingested by
each group.

Most  analyzed  stomach  contents  presented

high-level  digestion  conditions  that  can  interfere
with  the  accuracy  of  the  analysis.  Higher
occurrences  of  anthozoans,  sediment  and
crustaceans  in  males,  small  shrimps  and  immature
females  could  overestimate  the  stomach  fullness
analysis,  since  these  items  present  more  refractory
material  that  may  be  present  in  the  stomach  for  a
long  time  before  capture.  Large  individuals  and
mature  females  ingested  more  fishes  and
cephalopods,  which  are  digested  faster  and  could,
therefore, be underestimated. 

This could be because of the rapid digestion in
midwater decapods, with food being retained in the
stomach for only a few hours (Lagardère 1976, Roe
1984). However, the retention time of different food
types  in  the  guts  of  crustaceans  may  differ  among
the  prey  groups.  Hard  parts,  such  as  bones  or
mollusc shells, may be retained in the stomach for a
much longer time than fleshy tissues (Hill 1976, Joll
1982, Wassenberg &amp;amp; Hill 1987).
