resumo 
 

 

Os dados sísmicos 3D podem conter “lacunas” de cobertura devido a diversos 
problemas operacionais. As “lacunas” em dados 3D podem causar impactos 
adversos em várias etapas do processamento de dados, tais como na análise 
de velocidade, atenuação dos múltiplos, “stack” e migração. O Flex Binning é 
um método expediente para resolver este problema. O método Flex Binning 
permite que cada bin contenha mais traços, aumentando o tamanho efectivo 
de cada bin e incluindo traços dos bins vizinhos. O desafio é aplicar o Flex 
Binning a um número muito grande de traços que excedem as soluções 
actuais de design de software e capacidade de hardware. Vários testes foram 
realizados no software Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW). Durante os 
vários testes realizados, foi possível detectar e resolver problemas de código e 
“bugs” de software tais como, por exemplo, a incapacidade de aplicar uma 
grelha ao conjunto de dados e deixar traços fora da grelha. A questão da 
indexação foi outro problema detectado, que se resolveu por uma mudança de 
design do software no fluxo de processamento CMP Binning. A realização de 
vários testes nas diversas versões do SPW permitiu avanços na 
implementação do Flex Binning para conjuntos de dados de elevadas 
dimensões, nomeadamente a execução do fluxo CMP Binning com sucesso 
num conjunto de dados com 751GB. No fluxo de processamento CMP Binning, 
antes destes testes só era possível aplicar o Flex Binning corretamente a um 
conjunto de dados com aproximadamente 30 GB de tamanho.

abstract 

 
3D seismic reflection data may contain coverage gaps due to operational 
problems. The gaps in 3D data can cause adverse impacts in several steps of 
the data processing such as velocity analysis, multiple attenuation, stacking 
and migration. Flex Binning is an expedient method to solve these gaps. The 
Flex Binning method allows each bin to contain more traces, by increasing the 
effective size of each bin and thereby include traces which also fall into 
neighboring bins. The challenge is to apply Flex Binning to very large number 
of traces exceeding current software design solutions and hardware capability. 
Several tests were performed with the Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) 
software. During several tests, coding problems and bugs were detected and 
corrected, such as the inability to apply a grid to the dataset and leave traces 
out of the grid. Also, proper indexing was also solved by a change of software 
design in CMP Binning code. Beta testing on SPW allowed advances in the 
implementation of Flex Binning to large inputs, namely the execution of the 
CMP Binning flow successfully to a dataset with 751GB. The CMP Binning step 
before the tests could only Flex Binning effectively to an input with a size of 
approximately 30 GB.

1.  Introduction 

1.1 Nature and scope of this work 

The present dissertation is the result of a curricular internship at Geosurveys - Geophysical 

Consultants (GS), based in Aveiro (Portugal), for a period of eleven months, within the discipline 

of Dissertation / Project / Internship of the 2nd year of the Master's Degree in Geological 

Engineering (2nd cycle) of the University of Aveiro, under the supervision of Dr. Henrique Duarte, 

Director of the Geosurveys Marine Geophysics Department, and Professor Luís Menezes Pinheiro 

of the Department of Geosciences of the University of Aveiro. 

 

1.2 The Geosurveys – Geophysical Consultants 

The GS was formed in 1999 from an ambitious project, fundamentally oriented to the Prospecting 

Geophysics and Earth Sciences. To meet market needs, Geosurveys specializes in the areas of 

Geophysical Prospecting and Geology Onshore, Near-shore &amp;amp; Offshore, in the various fields of it is 

application, namely water resources, planning and management of projects in geophysics, 

environmental impact, archeology and patrimony, geotechnics and civil engineering, mining 

prospecting, and risk of natural catastrophes. 

Considering the services provided and in order to effectively manage the resources and 

employees, Geosurveys is divided into three Departments: The Financial Department, led by the 

General Manager Francisco Sobral; the Department of Marine Geophysics, headed by Senior 

Geophysicist Henrique Duarte; and the Department of Geophysics on Earth, led by Senior 

Geophysicist Carlos Grangeia. The position of Executive Director is occupied by the Senior 

Geophysicist Hélder Hermosilha. 

These departments consist of multidisciplinary teams of geophysicists, geologists and geological 

engineers, distributed between office and field, who work to give a good response to the various 

needs of the various clients.

1.3 Objectives of this work 

During the eleven-month internship at Geosurveys, in addition to the academic learning strand 

and the main goal of the research project, it was intended to obtain a professional experience in a 

business environment, as well as the familiarization with the way a company operates in the field 

of Marine Geophysics; these objectives have been fully met. 

Throughout this internship, several tasks were developed in the scope of the company's operating 

methods, in order to get familiar with the daily routines of the workers in a multi-channel seismic 

reflection data processing workstation, to learn to use processing and geological interpretation 

software, such as RadEx Pro (Deco Geophysical), ProMAX (Landmark Graphics Corporation) and 

Kingdom Suite (IHS Energy) as well as other industry standard software. Some of this knowledge 

was applied to the case study presented in this thesis.  

In order to gain experience and grow on a professional level, participation as a Trainee in some of 

the processing and geological interpretation projects carried out by the company has contributed 

extensively for this purpose. After an initial period of adjustment, the main activities concentrated 

on the proposed research work on the challenges of the application of the Flex Binning method to 

large datasets.  

3D seismic reflection data may contain coverage gaps due to operational problems. These gaps 

can cause adverse impacts in several steps of the data processing such as velocity analysis, 

multiple attenuation, stacking and migration. Flex Binning is an expedient method to solve these 

gaps. This method allows each bin to contain more traces, by increasing the effective size of each 

bin and thereby including traces which also fall into neighboring bins.  

The main objective and challenge of this project is to apply Flex Binning to very large number of 

traces exceeding current software design solutions and hardware capability. Several tests were 

performed on the Seismic Processing Workshop software. Beta testing on SPW carried out in the 

scope of this wok allowed significant advances to be made in the implementation of Flex Binning 

and made possible its application to large input datasets.

2.  The 3D Ultra High Resolution Seismic 

Reflection Method  

2.1 Basic Principles and Fundamentals 

The seismic reflection method, consists in emitting seismic waves (or seismic pulses) from at or 

near surface and record their return to the surface after reflection on the interfaces between the 

various subsurface formations with different acoustic and physical properties, and measuring the 

traveltimes and amplitudes, in order to reconstruct the subsurface geology. According to the 

Snell’s Law (Equation 1), the incident wave at an interface between two distinct layers is divided 

into a refracted part that continues to propagate downward in a slightly different direction than 

the incident wave and a reflected part that travels back to the surface.  

     
     

 
  
  

 (Eq.1) 

Where    is the incident angle,    is the refracted angle, and    and    represent the velocities of 

the seismic waves in two different media.   

In reality, what happens in the case of the non-normal incidence (Figure 2) is that there is a 

partition of energy at the interface and there will be wave mode conversion at the interface: 

shear waves (S-waves) are converted to longitudinal waves (P-waves) and vice-versa (Sheriff and 

Geldart, 1995; Telford et al., 1990). In order to determine the amplitude of the various reflected 

and refracted waves at a plane interface for an incident P-wave it is necessary to apply the 

Zoeppritz equations (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Telford et al., 1990).  

The P-waves are longitudinal and compressive, and travel at a velocity that depends on the elastic 

properties and densities of the rocks. The medium particles during S-wave propagation vibrate in 

a transverse way, with oscillatory movement’s perpendicular to the direction of propagation, 

causing shear when the wave is transmitted, and propagate slower than the P-waves. Another 

characteristic of the S-waves it is that they cannot propagate in fluids, since these are not capable 

to suffer shear.

incidence.      and     represent the density values for the two different layers.    and     represent the velocity values 

of the seismic waves (adapted from Ribeiro, 2011). 
 

In order to get information about the subsurface geology, as well as the rock properties and layers 

attitude, the traveltimes and amplitude of the reflected waves from the source through the 

subsurface and then back to the receivers are recorded, processed and interpreted. 

The two-way time (TWT) is the time that a wave takes to travel from its source, down to an 

interface between two layers with different physical properties (specifically the density (?) and 

the seismic wave velocity (V)) and back to the surface where it is recorded by the receivers. The 

acoustic impedance (Z) is the product of the density the formation by the velocity of propagation 

of the waves in that formation.  

The difference between the formations with diverse physical proprieties provides us with a 

contrast of acoustic impedance (Z). The Reflection Coefficient (RC) between two layers, for the 

simplified case of normal incidence is proportional to the acoustic impedance contrast (Equation 2, 

valid only for normal incidence). 

   
           
           

 
     
     

 (Eq.2) 

The seismic dataset obtained after a seismic survey and its fundamental properties, such as the 

seismic resolution, are principally determined by the acquisition parameters and by the system 

characteristics (in particular its frequency spectrum). After acquisition, the next step is data 

processing, and this step can significantly improve the image resolution and attenuate unwanted 

noise within some limits. The resolution, in a general way, can be defined as the ability to 

distinguish two very closely distinct objects. The seismic resolution is directly related to the 



 

7 
 

frequency and duration of the pulse. Power sources that emit high-frequency pulses have higher 

resolution and therefore a greater ability to detect thin layers. 

Thus, seismic resolution is a matter of major importance in seismic data acquisition (Yilmaz, 2001). 

UHRS (Ultra High Resolution Seismic) data was used in this work, and normally has a denser data 

acquired and contains a range of frequencies above 500 Hz to 5kHz.

The vertical resolution of the seismic wave is defined as the minimum thickness of a layer 

required to distinguish a reflection from its top to the base, i.e. the ability to recognize individual, 

closely-spaced distinct reflectors. The vertical resolution is determined by the pulse length (or 

frequency) of the seismic system. The seismic frequency is directly related to the vertical 

resolution: higher frequency provides higher resolution. The frequency is expressed as number of 

cycles per second (1cycle/s = 1Hertz) and higher frequencies mean shorter pulses and 

consequently better vertical resolution (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Kearey et al. , 2002).  

The top and the base of a stratigraphic unit (two distinguish reflectors), can be recognized as 

separated seismic events only if the distance between them is at least ¼ of wavelength (?) of the 

seismic wavelet (Equation 3; McQuillin et al., 1984). 

  
 

 
 (Eq.3) 

Where V is the seismic wave velocity in the layer and f is frequency. 

As the waves travel in the subsurface, the seismic wave will lose the highest frequencies in depth, 

because they are more rapidly absorbed. Thus, high-frequencies waves are attenuated much 

faster than low-frequencies. The higher frequency, the lower will therefore be the depth 

penetration, but the higher will be the vertical resolution. 

 
Horizontal resolution 

The horizontal resolution of a seismic wave is principally controlled by the “1st Fresnel Zone” that 

consists of the area of the sub-surface that contributes to the reflection. A reflection that is 

coming back to the surface is being reflected not from a reflecting point, but from an area with 

the dimension of the “First Fresnel Zone”.  



 

8 
 

The “First Fresnel Zone” according to the Huygens’s principle is an area where the waves interfere 

with each other constructively. This principle also states that each part of a wave front acts as a 

source of a new wave (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

Figure 3. Schematic representation of the First Fresnel Zone (Kearey et al., 1991). 
 

As shown in Equation 4, the radius of the 1st Fresnel Zone (FR) depends on the average seismic 

velocity on the layer (V), the depth of the target (t, in TWT) and the frequency of the seismic 

signal (f) (Sheriff and Geldart, 199). The Fresnel zone increases, and consequently horizontal 

resolution decreases, with increasing velocity of the propagating medium and travel-time (depth), 

and also with lower signal frequency.

 (Eq.4) 

Diffractions 

The presence of discontinuities at the interfaces between the various layers, for example due to 

the presence of faults (Figure 4) or a very irregular topography of the reflecting interface, 

generates diffractions, which appear in the seismic sections as hyperbolae. These diffractions 

appear because the interface between the formations truncates abruptly, then secondary waves 

do not cancel at the edge, and diffraction is observed (Huygens’s principle). In data processing 

with migration, it is possible to collapse the hyperbolae.

Multiples 

The presence of multiple reflections in the seismic sections due to reflections, for example at the 

water / air interface in a marine environment or multiple internal reflections in the various layers 

in the presence of strong acoustic impedance contrasts, makes interpretation very difficult. They 

can be attenuated with special processing techniques (i.e. during the stack), but their total 

removal is a virtually impossible task – significant advances in processing have however been 

achieved in recent years. There are diverse types of multiple reflections as can be seen in Figure 5.

2.2 Seismic Data Acquisition 

In the acquisition of multi-channel seismic reflection data in marine environment, a streamer of 

hydrophones and a seismic source are towed behind a ship. The streamer will be receiving the 

reflected waves from the subsurface and convert them into electrical signals.  

In the 2D seismic marine acquisition, a single streamer is used (Figure 6 A); in 3D seismic marine 

acquisition several streamers are towed behind the vessel (Figure 6 B), and the shooting direction 

(boat track) is called the inline direction (Yilmaz, 2001). The three-dimensional (3D) seismic 

acquisition method appeared only in 1972, when the American G.G. Walton presented it for the 

first time to the scientific community. 

 

Figure 6. Schematic images the two types of seismic acquisition on sea. A) 2D seismic acquisition (Kearey et al., 2002). B) 

3D seismic acquisition (http://wikigrewal.com/offshore-marine-seismic-surveying/). 
 

The 3D seismic marine acquisition has several advantages over the two-dimensional seismic 

acquisition: it resolves the structural and stratigraphic details of the subsurface that were missing 

or were simply not visible in 2D seismic, and therefore it is possible to visualize the potential 

reservoirs (oil and gas) in three dimensions, allowing the interpreter to obtain detailed 

information on faults and fractures, stratification planes, presence of pores and fluids, complex 

structural geology and detailed stratigraphy. It also allows correct positioning of the reflectors in 

3D. 

Although the 3D seismic marine acquisition has several advantages, it is more expensive, and 

requires more sophisticated and more expensive equipment, and therefore it takes more time to 

check if all the equipment, including the multiple streamers, is working and ready for acquisition. 

The 3D seismic marine acquisition is a complex method and therefore the acquisition geometry is 

also complex if good azimuth illumination coverage is intended. 



 

11 
 

The traditional geometry used in 3D data acquisition uses lines previously delineated over the 

area of interest. After completing each navigation route, the vessel goes to the next acquisition 

line, (transit time), in the opposite direction, parallel to the previous one (Figure 7 A). During the 

change of direction/acquisition line there will be a change in the position of the sources and 

receivers resulting in non-productive time. 

For the optimization of non-productive time, new acquisition geometries were developed. As an 

example, we have Wide-Azimuth (Buia et al., 2008) and Coil Shooting (Buia et al., 2008). 

 

Figure 7. Schematic images of the three type’s ways to make a 3D seismic acquisition on sea. A) The basic 3-D 

Acquisition, this is the most traditional way (Buia et al., 2008). B) The Wide-azimuth survey (Buia et al., 2008) C) The Coil 

shooting acquisition technique (Buia et al., 2008). 
 

In Wide-Azimuth (Figure 7 B) the same acquisition pattern is used as in the traditional acquisition, 

but with several vessels that shoot sequentially in different directions for the same streamers, 

which allows better azimuthal coverage of the study area. This method proved to obtain better 

data namely, less noise, better resolution, improvements in the attenuation of multiples and the 

quality of the reflectors, simplifying the seismic interpretation (Buia et al., 2008). 

The Coil Shooting (Figure 7 C) is a technique, proposed by the company Schlumberger, for seismic 

acquisition that uses a circular pattern for data collection, with little or no unproductive time. It 

allows getting data of short offsets, something not possible by the traditional geometry and 

involves only a single ship equipped with several seismic sources and streamers, and that runs a 



 

12 
 

continuous circular trajectory on the study area (Buia et al., 2008). In circular geometries, we 

obtain azimuth coverage values in the order of 90% while in parallel line geometries the 

acquisition productivity drops to approximately 45%. From the economic point of view, it is more 

lucrative to use the WAZ method in large areas of exploration and Coil Shooting in small/medium 

areas (Buia et al., 2008). 

 

2.2.1 Marine Seismic Sources  

There is a wide variety of seismic sources characterized by diverse levels of energy, typical 

frequencies and method of operation. Frequencies of the seismic sources can range from 1Hz to 

several hundred or even thousands of hertz (Figure 8). 

 

Figure 8. Acoustic spectrum of different seismic sources (Kearey et al., 2002). 
 

The data used in this master thesis came from a high frequency seismic source, in this case, a 

Sparker. The sparkers are equipment’s that convert electrical energy into acoustic energy, 

through a pulse that is generated by the discharge of a large capacitors to create a spark between 

two electrodes inside conducting water.  



 

13 
 

The operating voltages are characteristically 3.5–4.0 kV and peak currents may exceed 200 A. This 

electrical discharge leads to the formation and rapid growth of a plasma bubble and the 

consequent generation of an acoustic pulse (Kearey et al., 2002). 

 

2.2.2 Marine Seismic Receivers  

In order to receive and record the reflected seismic waves when the acquisition campaigns are 

made at sea, streamers are used, which are arrays of hydrophones, distributed over several 

channels along an extensive plastic tube filled with a liquid that allows the streamer keep to the 

surface. 

The hydrophones are composed of ceramic piezoelectric elements (Figure 9) which produce an 

output electrical signal (voltage) proportional to the pressure variations associated with the 

passage of a compressional seismic wave through water.  

The sensitivity of this equipment is typically 0.1mVPa
-1

 (Kearey et al., 2002). Each crystal element 

consists of an annular piezoelectric ring, metallic-coated on both surfaces, bonded at the open 

ends by thin convex metallic diaphragms.

2.3 Basic Seismic Data Processing 

The typical seismic processing flows are implemented to increase the seismic vertical resolution, 

improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and to display the seismic events in their correct 

spatial position (Yilmaz, 2001;  McQuillin et al., 1984; Kearey et al., 1991). 

A typical processing flow for a 2D survey is composed by a first part known as the pre-processing 

stage, and a second part which constitutes the specific processing flow. The pre-processing 

includes: demultiplexing, quality control, trace editing, filtering, spherical divergence and gain 

corrections, and geometry and static corrections; the second part normally includes: 

deconvolution, filtering, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout (NMO) correction, CMP 

stack and migration (Yilmaz, 2001). The first step in pre-processing is to perform the 

demultiplexing, an operation that consists of reorganizing the data to a format appropriate for 

processing as shot gathers. Conventionally, in the oil industry the SEG-Y format is used to store 

and share seismic data (Yilmaz, 2001). 

In the quality control phase, the traces that are recognized by the operator as anomalous (noisy 

or inverted polarity) are eliminated so as not to compromise the remaining data. A basic filter is 

also applied to eliminate the noise characteristic of low frequencies caused by bad atmospheric 

conditions or undesired streamer movements, for example, cable feathering (Yilmaz, 2001). 

The correction of spherical divergence is a function that applies some gain to compensate for the 

loss of amplitude of the seismic energy as it moves away from the source inside the Earth, by 

increasing the gain of the signal with increasing distance. This correction must be used when 

considering large distances, for small distances requires some care in their use as it can greatly 

increase noise instead of improving data.  

After the data is corrected, it is ready for the definition of the acquisition geometry in the field, 

positioning the sources and receivers in the trace headers. This step is the one of the most 

important phases of the processing, and may lead to many problems if a wrong definition of 

parameters is used. 

The recorded seismic trace is a convolution of the seismic wavelet with the reflection coefficient 

series which result from the contrasting properties (density and seismic velocity) of the different 

rock layers, where the seismic rays pass through. 



 

15 
 

The deconvolution it is an inverse filtering technique used to compress an oscillatory (long) source 

waveform, often seen on marine data, into a spike (unit-impulse function), as close as possible. 

This technique allows eliminating some noise that was convolved during the acquisition, for 

instance, the source signature and derived multiples, obtaining the reflection coefficient series of 

the geological formations, once the shape of the wavelet is made closer to a peak of energy. The 

great advantage of deconvolution is to increase the vertical resolution by compressing the 

wavelet without compromising the frequency content. This procedure leads to a significant 

improvement of the seismic profile but can also increase high frequency noise and may require 

subsequent filtering (Yilmaz, 2001). 

The velocity analysis is performed on selected CMP gathers (Figure 10) or group of gathers (Super 

Gathers). The velocity model is then used to correct the NMO of the CMP gathers and afterwards 

in migration.  

 

Figure 10. Common mid-point (CMP) reflection profiling. A set of rays from different shots (Si) to detectors (Di) 

reflected off a common depth point (CDP) on a horizontal reflector (Kearey et al.,2002). 
 

The NMO correction is applied to correct differences in distance between the source and the 

receiver inside the same CMP’s family (Figure 11 A), in a non-dipping reflector, assuming that the 

propagation distance as a function of time describes a hyperbolic trajectory; the goal of NMO 

correction is to remove the curvature of this reflection hyperbola (Yilmaz, 2001). 

After the NMO correction (Figure 11 B) of the CMP gather, the next step of the typical processing 

flow is the CMP Stacking (this is possible because, the data came from multi-channel seismic 

acquisition with multiple CMP coverage). The Stack (Figure 11 C) consists of summing the traces 

which belong to the same CMP location into just one trace at normal incidence, after NMO 



 

16 
 

correction. This process will increase the signal-to-noise ratio and attenuate noise such as 

multiples and ground roll, because the reflected signal and coherent noise usually have different 

stacking velocities (Yilmaz, 2001). 

 

Figure 11 . A) Sorted CMP gathers; every Si-Ri that corresponds to the same reflection point; B) CMP gather after 

executing the NMO corrections; C) Stacked trace with a better signal (from http://www.gsj.go.jp, modified by Ribeiro, 

2011). 
 

The standard processing flow usually finishes with a migration. This process moves the seismic 

reflectors to their correct position in space, if the realistic velocity model is calculated. The 

migration process will move the dipping events into their supposedly true subsurface positions, 

collapse the diffractions, increase the spatial resolution and correct amplitudes for geometric 

focusing effects (Yilmaz, 2001). This process can be applied after (post-stack migration) or before 

the stack (pre-stack migration).  

The pre-stack migration it is a heavy computational process and takes a long time to complete. 

The algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, instead of being applied to the 

stacked data (Yilmaz, 2001). The pre-stack migration produces an image of the subsurface with 

superior quality, allowing the user a better interpretation of the area under study. 

The main differences between the 2D seismic data processing and 3D seismic data processing are: 

quality control, statics correction, velocity analysis, migration and the way in which reflective 

points are considered for seismic processing purposes. All the processing steps (either in 2D 

seismic data processing or 3D seismic data processing) should be quality controlled through the 

seismic processing job to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing during the seismic 

data processing. Cable feathering is caused by cross currents, and in marine 3-D surveys can result 



 

17 
 

in travel time deviations from a single hyperbolic moveout within a common-cell gather (Yilmaz, 

2001). 

As described previously, the 2D seismic processing, requires first sorting the recorded data into 

common midpoint gathers, and in a similar form, the processing of 3D seismic data requires 

Binning the recorded the traces into common cell gathers (bins) to create common-cell stacks.  A 

common-cell gather coincides with a CMP gather for swath shooting. For marine surveys, the 

typical cell sizes are 12.5 × 25 m (Yilmaz, 2001). 

For a surface subdivided by a grid of lines, the area between adjacent lines is called a Bin. The 

traces which fall within a bin are assumed to lie at the bin centre, which is also called a node or 

grid cell. The Binning is sorting traces into the appropriate bin (Sheriff, 2002). 

The traces are assigned to specific bins according to the midpoint (Middle Point) between 

the source and the receiver (Figure 12). Bins are commonly assigned according to common 

midpoint (CMP), but more sophisticated seismic processing allows for other types of Binning. 

Traces within a bin are stacked to generate the output trace for that bin. Data quality depends in 

part on the number of traces per bin, or the fold. 

 

Figure 12. Schematic image about what contains a bin. 
 

Conventional 3-D recording geometries often complicate the process of stacking the data in a 

common-cell gather. After stacking, the 3-D data volume is migrated. Before migration, the data 

sometimes needs to be trace-interpolated along the crossline direction to avoid spatial aliasing 

(Yilmaz, 2001). The migrated 3-D data volume then is available to the interpreter as vertical 

sections in both the inline and crossline directions and as horizontal sections.

3. The Hornsea Offshore Windfarm Project 

One - 3D UHRS Survey – Case Study  

As referred to in Chapter 1, the study area is located in the southern North Sea. In order to make 

the reader first acquainted with the geological setting of the seismic survey, this Chapter starts 

with a brief summary of the geological setting of the study area and its geological evolution. This 

is followed by a description of the seismic survey details and the presentation of some images of 

the resulting seismic block, in which the main seismic horizons are interpreted. 

 

3.1 Geological Framework of the Southern North Sea 

Hans Stille, in 1924, divided the European continent into four major domains according to the 

time of the orogenic stabilization, based on the last orogeny that affected them: the Eo-Europe 

(Precambrian Europe), the Paleo-Europe (Caledonian Europe), the Meso-Europe (Variscan Europe) 

and the Neo-Europe (Alpine Europe). The Southern North Sea is inserted on Paleo-Europe, 

without significant deformation since the end of the lower Paleozoic (Figure 13). 

The Southern North Sea Basin has a complicated and vast history of geological events, namely 

basinal subsidence. The basinal subsidence has been interrupted by distinct episodes of uplift and 

widespread erosion.  

 

Figure 13. Main tectonic units of Europe, based on Stille (1924) and modified by Ribeiro et al., 1979. 



 

20 
 

3.1.1 Paleozoic (541 -252.1 Million years ago)  

Throughout most of the southern North Sea the lower Paleozoic sediments intruded by granite 

plutons and mildly deformed during the Caledonian Orogeny of Late Silurian to Early Devonian 

approximately 420 - 390 million years ago (Balson et al., 2001; Cameron et al., 1992). 

The predominantly WNW and NW trends of the faults within the Late Paleozoic, Mesozoic and 

Cenozoic sequences may be hereditary from the structure of the fundamental Lower Paleozoic 

basement (Balson et al.., 2001). 

Following the Caledonian uplift, most of the Southern North Sea remained an area of erosion 

under the sea about 410-360 million years (Devonian). Crustal extension started early in the 

Carboniferous approximately 360 million years ago, which allowed the deposition of deltaic 

sediments within the graben areas (Cameron et al., 1992). 

Some of the granite batholiths inferred from their geophysical signatures may lie beneath early 

Carboniferous horsts (Cameron et al., 1992), though expressively different interpretations exist 

for the locations of the syn-rift blocks and basins (Collinson et al., 1993; Besley, 1998). The rifting 

had effectively ceased and a phase of thermal subsidence had commenced, around 325 million 

years ago (Balson et al., 2001). 

During the Variscan Orogeny about 300-290 million years ago, the Carboniferous rocks were 

moderately folded and faulted. About 310 - 270 million years ago, a differential Late 

Carboniferous to Early Permian regional uplift led to the erosion of more than 1500 m of 

Carboniferous strata from parts of the Southern North Sea Basin (Balson et al., 2001). 

The southern North Sea Basin, after the Variscan Orogeny, began to subside again in the Permian 

times, and more than 2700 m of Permo-Triassic levels, covering an age range of around 290-210 

million years were deposited, including red beds and a thick, cyclical, evaporite succession (Ziegler, 

1975; Balson et al., 2001). 

 

3.1.2 Mesozoic (252.1-66.0 Million years ago)  

The Late Triassic and Early Jurassic subsidence in the Sole Pit Basin was related to the reactivation 

of its Variscan basement faults (Glennie and Boegner, 1981). These tectonic movements 

generated the earliest mid-Triassic halokinesis of the Upper Permian salts (Balson et al., 2001). 



 

21 
 

The marine conditions were then re-established in the southern North Sea at the end of the 

Triassic. Then, during early–mid Jurassic times, differential subsidence of the Sole Pit Basin was 

accentuated by the extensional faults along the western margin. It is these faults that account for 

the major thickness of the Lower and Middle Jurassic sediments between the East Midlands Shelf 

and the Sole Pit Basin (Balson et al., 2001). 

In the Middle Jurassic, widespread domal uplift centreed in the central North Sea and resulted in 

an erosional unconformity. More than 1000 m of Jurassic and Triassic strata were eroded from 

the Cleaver Bank High at this time (Glennie, 1986). During the Late Jurassic, there was a 

widespread pulse of diapirism (Glennie and Underhill, 1998; Balson et al., 2001). 

Lower Cretaceous sediments are typically less than 200 m thick, but reach up to 1000 m in local 

zones of growth faulting, associated with sinistral fault movement (Kirby and Swallow, 1987). 

During the Late Cretaceous, the Cleaver Bank High became established as the main depocentre 

and accumulated more than 1000 m of Upper Cretaceous chalk (Balson et al., 2001).  

The Upper Cretaceous chalk formations include cemented carbonate platforms of chalk crop at 

seabed. Chalk is an important aquifer in the onshore and offshore margins of the southern North 

Sea where it covers large areas (Balson et al., 2001). 

 

3.1.3 Cenozoic (66.0 -0.0 Million years ago)  

The Sole Pit Basin and the Cleveland Basin are two examples of basins from NW Europe that have 

been affected by basin inversion during, or at the end of, the Late Cretaceous. This basin has been 

attributed to strike-slip reactivations of basement faults (Glennie and Boegner, 1981;  Balson et al., 

2001). 

Cenozoic subsidence in the North Sea has been controlled by broad synclinal down warping 

towards a depositional axis that extends from the Viking Graben, through the Central Graben in 

the direction of the Netherlands (Balson et al., 2001).During the Cenozoic, the basin was lightly 

deformed by tectonic inversion and basin-margin uplift driven by intraplate compression, 

resulting from the interplay between the opening of the NE Atlantic Ocean and the Alpine 

orogeny (Caston, 1977; Graham et al., 2011). 

During Oligocene to Miocene times, many of the basement faults in the Southern North Sea were 

reactivated by dextral strike-slip (Glennie and Boegner, 1981), which triggered further major 



 

22 
 

halokinesis. Most of the salt pillows north of 54
o
 north were initiated in mid-Cenozoic times, and 

Glennie (1986) connected contemporaneous inversion of the Sole Pit Basin to Alpine movements. 

There are very few Miocene sediments and Pliocene deposits too (Balson et al., 2001). Since the 

Mid-Cenozoic, up to 3000 m of Oligocene to Holocene sediment has accumulated in the central 

graben region, including, locally, more than 800 m of Quaternary sediment (Caston, 1977; Graham 

et al., 2011).  

Rapid subsidence became more widespread early in the Quaternary resulting in the preservation 

of more than 600 m of Pleistocene progradational delta deposits and glaciogenic deposits (Balson 

et al., 2001). 

The Quaternary climatic change was a major event in the recent history and is preserved in the 

sedimentary record of the southern North Sea; during the colder periods it exhibited mean annual 

air temperatures well below zero degrees Celsius (Plant et al., 2003). The major effects of this 

event are erosion and deposition of material over large parts of the continents and surrounding 

seas, modification of the river systems, creation of multiple small bodies of water, major changes 

in sea level and isostatic adjustment of the crust (Long et al., 1988). This has affected the type of 

deposits available to be preserved on the geological record and their properties.  

Unfortunately, most terrestrial evidence for most of some 25 such glacial cycles, recognized in 

marine sediments, has been destroyed by subsequent events. The surviving geomorphological 

and stratigraphically record is usually restricted to deposits of the main glacial events, which are 

the Elsterian, the Saalian and the Weichselian glaciations (Figure 14; Long et al., 1988).  

The Quaternary of the British sector of the North Sea has been divided into several groups, as 

described below. 

 

Crag Group 

The base of quaternary in British sector of the North Sea is now taken at the top of the Red Crag 

Formation, an Upper Pliocene formation consisting of shell-bearing glauconitic sediment, which 

occurs at or near bed off the coast of East Anglia (Long et al., 1988; Stoker et al., 2011). The Red 

Crag Formation is the only offshore formation of the Crag Group. This formation is a high-energy 

shallow-marine glauconitic deposit, and therefore lithologically like to the onshore formation with 

the same geological time.  



 

23 
 

The Red Crag Formation might range in age from Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, around to 

3.2–2.4 Ma, based on the presence of the planktonic foraminiferid (Funnell, 1988).  It is rests with 

marked unconformity on Palaeogene or Neogene formations and is unconformably overlain by 

deposits of the Southern North Sea Deltaic Group (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011). 

 

Figure 14. Map of the North Europe, showing the maximum extension of the European ice sheets: the Elsterian, the 

Saalian and the Weichselian glaciations (from Anderson and Borns, 1997). 

 



 

24 
 

Southern North Sea Deltaic Group 

In the British sector (Figure 16), the Lower to early middle Pleistocene succession displays seismic 

facies that can relate to a specific environment, a delta complex (Long et al., 1988). The Southern 

North Sea Deltaic Group is defined essentially nine constituent formations: the Westkapelle 

Ground, Crane, Smith’s Knoll, Ijmuiden Ground, Winterton Shoal, Markham’s Hole, Outer Silver Pit, 

Aurora and Batavier formations.  These formations succeed each other northwards as the delta 

prograde into the basin. The base of the Southern North Sea Deltaic Group is around Early 

Pleistocene, and mostly overlies the Red Crag Formation, though the latter may be partly 

correlated with the Westkapelle Ground Formation (Stoker et al., 2011). 

The term Southern North Sea Deltaic Group is proposed for a thick succession of marine deltaic 

formations, including delta front and prodelta deposits (apart from the Crane Formation), formed 

by sediments derived from south eastern England and the Netherlands that are preserved in the 

Southern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011). 

The deltaic and pro-deltaic sediments from this group are associated with the development of the 

southern North Sea delta, which has been compared in size to the largest modern delta 

complexes in the world (Ekman and Scourse, 1993), and was accountable for the majority of non-

glacial deposition during the Early to Mid-Pleistocene in the southern and central North Sea 

(Cameron et al., 1992; Graham et al., 2011; Stoker et al., 2011). 

The union of the two delta fronts occurred in earliest Beestonian (Eburonian) times, when the 

direction of advance swung northwards (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., 

2011). The top deltaic group is diachronous with the Yarmouth Roads Formation, which is here 

assigned to the Dunwich Group (Cameron et al., 1992; Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., 2011). 

 

Dunwich Group 

The Yarmouth Roads Formation is the only offshore formation to be assigned to the Dunwich 

Group, which has been correlated in part with the Sudbury Formation of the Kesgrave Catchment 

Subgroup in East Anglia (onshore). The base is highly diachronous being oldest 

(Beestonian/Waalian) in the south, and becoming less easily definable towards the centre of the 

basin, where it is locally coeval with the fully marine formations of the Southern North Sea Deltaic 

Group. The formation was deposited prior to the Anglian (MIS?12) and is unconformably overlain 

by the California Glacigenic Group (Cameron and Holmes, 1999; Stoker et al., 2011). 



 

25 
 

California Glacigenic Group 

Generally, glacier related deposits are preserved in the sedimentary record of the southern North 

Sea by moraine, glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits from the Elsterian, Saalian and 

Weichselian glacial periods (Figure 14). At these times, the British and Fennoscandian ice sheets 

covered certain amounts of the area, contributing to the erosion, supply of sediments and infill of 

this basin (Stoker et al., 2011; Long et al., 2011). 

The California Glacigenic Group consists essentially in 16 formations. The base of this group is 

marked by the Swarte Bank Formation. The Swarte Bank Formation is located in the base of 

buried valleys in the southern North Sea Basin, south of 55°N (Davies et al., 2011). During the 

Elsterian glacial period (MIS 12), full glacial conditions led to the erosion and infilling of a major 

system of tunnel valleys, up to 12 km wide and 400 m deep, in the southern North Sea Basin 

(Cameron et al., 1987). 

The infilling of the valleys commenced with stiff glacial and glaciofluvial sand, overlain by 

glaciolacustrine muds and culminating with marine interglacial sediments of the Sand Hole and 

Egmond Ground formations. The age of the infilling deposits therefore is from late Anglian to 

earliest Hoxnian (Stoker et al., 2011). 

The Cleaver Bank and Tea Kettle Hole formations happen near to the centre of the southern 

North Sea, they are both of Wolstonian age (Figure 15). The Cleaver Bank Formation is a partly 

marine proglacial diamicton with clasts derived from the east (Cameron et al., 1992), but also 

includes glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial facies. The Tea Kettle Hole Formation is broadly 

contemporaneous with the Cleaver Bank Formation, and consists of discontinuous deposits of 

periglacial aeolian sands. These units are overlain by the interglacial Eem Formation (Stoker et al., 

2011). 

The earliest set of glacigenic units consists of seven formations: the Well Ground, Bolders Bank, 

Dogger Bank, Botney Cut, Twente, Sunderland Ground and Hirundo formations, which are all 

Devensian. Periglacial, fluvial deposits comprise the Well Ground Formation.  

Climatic deterioration towards fully glacial conditions caused regional sea level in the North Sea to 

fall to at least 110 m below present by late Weicheselian glacial period. A blanket deposit of 

Weichselian is the Boulders Bank Formation. This formation is a widespread deposit of diamicton 

believed to have been deposited by a lobe of ice which moved down the east coast of England 

(Cameron et al., 1987).  



 

26 
 

The Bolders Bank Formation (Figure 16) interfingers with proglacial sediments of the Dogger Bank 

Formation. Previous micromorphological investigation of the Bolders Bank Formation indicated 

genesis as a subglacial till (Carr et al., 2000), reflecting an ice sheet extending across the southern 

North Sea (Davies et al., 2011). Subglacial valleys were incised into older Pleistocene sediments 

and have partially been infilled by the diamictons of the Botney Cut Formation (Stoker et al., 

2011). 

The Twente Formation represents periglacial wind-blown sands deposited near the ice margin. 

Late-stage infilling of troughs as the ice retreated westwards occurred with the glaciolacustrine to 

glaciomarine sediments of the Sunderland Ground and Hirundo formations (Stoker et al., 2011). 

As already mentioned, there are a few formations that corresponds some marine interglacial units. 

These units are represented by six constituent formations, namely, the Sand Hole and Egmond 

Ground formations are Hoxnian (Holsteinian interglacial period); the Eem and Brown Bank 

formations are Ipswichian to Early Devensian; and the Elbow and Southern Bight formations are 

Holocene (Stoker et al., 2011). 

The Sand Hole Formation is confined to an area around the modern Inner Silver Pit. In contrast, 

the Egmond Ground Formation occurs widely and may infill the uppermost portions of Anglian 

subglacial valleys overlying the Swarte Bank or earlier deltaic formations such as those of the 

Dunwich Group. A stratigraphical break due to the fall in sea level during Wolstonian times 

separates these formations from those of the next marine incursion during Ipswichian times 

(Stoker et al., 2011). 

The marine sediments of the Eem Formation (Eemian interglacial period) have been identified at 

several sites and are made of intertidal and shallow marine sands and clays. This formation rests 

unconformably on the Egmond Ground Formation and is overlain by a marginal marine deposit, 

the Brown Bank Formation, which may have been deposited as sea levels fell during Early 

Devensian times equivalent to MIS?4 (Cameron and Holmes, 1999). A further stratigraphical break 

separates these formations from the deposits of the postglacial return of marine conditions into 

the southern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011). 

Finally, the earliest Holocene brackish-marine incursion into the southern North Sea may have 

occurred as early as 10 ka BP (Eisma et al., 1981). The earliest Holocene is characterized by the 

Elbow Formation; this formation was deposited in shallow water intertidal or coastal 

environments.

As fully open marine conditions became established the Elbow Formation was overlain 

unconformably by the deposits of the Southern Bight Formation, which contains a number of 

diachronous members. These members include transgressive deposits that formed around 8000 

BP (Eisma et al., 1981; Long et al., 1988) and the modern mobile marine sediments, such as those 

found within sandwaves or sandbanks in the southern North Sea (Stoker et al., 2011).

3.2 Seismic Data Acquisition  

The seismic data acquisition was carried on board of MV Bibby Tethra vessel in the Hornsea 

Project One Offshore wind farm, East of England, North Sea. The 3D multi-channel spread 

operation was carried out by GeoMarine Survey Systems and the onboard data QC/QA by 

Geosurveys.

3.3 3D Seismic Blocks 

During the acquisition, a 2 m bin grid for each volume was created in order to assign Inline and 

Crossline values to the volumes. The 3D seismic blocks had some problems during the acquisition, 

namely the gaps in the seismic (Figure 18). A possible solution to solve the problem it is the Flex 

Binning method which will be explained in the following sub-chapters since its application is one 

of the main goals of this thesis.

The area under study is also geologically highly complex, as described above in the subchapter 

Geological Framework of the Southern North Sea. Nevertheless, it is likely that the HOW01 UHRS 

data images only show the Quaternary geology. The Hornsea Offshore Windfarm Project One area 

was under the influence of glaciers and that is registered in its geological record (Figure 19). Also, 

the numerous erosional surfaces present are likely to be related with glaciers and sea level 

changes (Figure 19 and Figure 20).

The seismic data is recorded using a proprietary binary format. Data can be converted to SEG-Y or 

SEG-D format immediately after the end of the line. In a typical 3D acquisition situation, for each 

trace there exist at least 26 trace headers and normally 5 traces are acquired per second with 96 

channels in total (4 streamers x 24 channels); after one minute of acquisition there are 28800 

traces. Therefore, in an hour of acquisition there are 1728000 traces and 10368000 trace headers 

total.  

The B27H27 seismic block took approximately 41 hours to be acquired and has 74059656 traces 

and 1925551056 headers. This seismic block is not the largest that Geosurveys has acquired, but it 

is possible already to see that these acquisitions involve a very large volume of traces as well as 

trace headers. The SEG Y files in this type of seismic datasets therefore contain a large number of 

traces; there are more traces than the expected in a normal dataset, which leads to software 

limitations, as SPW is not prepared for these data sizes yet. Therefore, the high dimensions of 

traces and headers on the dataset can be a problem, because they influence the performance of 

the SPW program (software limit), the computer hardware limits, and time for efficient processing.

4.  Flex Binning Implementation in SPW 

In this Chapter, after a brief explanation about Flex Binning and a description of the way in which 

it was originally implemented in SPW, the tests of its application to 3D UHRS data are described, 

together with the problems found and the solutions adopted. 

 

4.1 What is Flex Binning? 

Due to sea conditions, which often cause cable feathering, the majority of 3D marine seismic 

surveys do not have a regular sampling of offsets. This results in fold variation, mainly for larger 

offsets, or even in areas with no data at all, causing severe impacts in several steps of the data 

processing such as velocity analysis, multiple attenuation, stacking and migration. Surveys which 

have this common problem require the insertion of the Flex Binning method into the workflow, 

which is the aim of this work.  

The Flex Binning process attempts to maintain a uniform CDP fold and offset distribution 

throughout the surveyed area. In order to make the distribution of offsets more uniform, the bins 

are extended by a percentage of their size (GeoSurveys, 2016). This extension can be made in 

both in-line and cross-line directions. If no trace is found within the original bin then a trace inside 

the extended bin is used. If several traces are found in the neighboring bins, usually the selected 

the trace is the one nearer to the bin centre. Figure 21 shows the process of bin expansion.  

 

Figure 21. Bin expansion diagram. See text for explanation. 



 

34 
 

In Figure 21, the bin A is expanded for a near offset trace with a relatively small expansion. The 

bin B is searching for traces with a larger offset, i.e. with a larger bin expansion, and gets three 

results; the trace closest to the bin centre is the one that is borrowed. Bin C already has a far 

offset trace and no bin extension is needed. The red trace (near-offset trace) will end up being 

used by both bin A and D. 

There are other alternative solutions, instead using the Flex Binning, namely the Regularization 

and Interpolation. In this work, the Flex Binning method will be used. 

 

4.2 The SPW Flex Binning 

As stated above, one of the main objectives of this thesis was to test the application of the 

available Flex Binning routines in the SPW software (from Parallel Geoscience) to Ultra High 

Resolution 3D seismic Datasets commonly acquired by Geosurveys and to investigate how to 

make it efficient enough so that it can be applied in the field, just after the data acquisition to fill 

identified cover gaps before preliminary field processing. This work was carried out in close 

collaboration with the Parallel Geoscience software development team, so that when problems 

were identified, solutions could be sought, implemented and new tests performed for checking 

the proposed solutions. For this purpose, two seismic datasets were used: (1) a medium size 

dataset (209 GB) and a large volume dataset (462 GB). The first one was used to detect any 

software bugs and problems before testing the software in a large dataset. After most of the code 

problems were solved, it was used the largest dataset acquired in the survey area (751 GB). 

In SPW, the Flex Binning Processing Step consists of 2 main flows: (a) the CMP Binning flow, 

described in Section 4.2.2 and (b) the Bin Fold Limit flow, described in Section 4.2.3.  

 

4.2.1 Data input 

Before running the Flex Binning flow, just after acquisition, it is fundamental to verify first the 

contents in the various header positions in the SEG-Y input file, so as to create a SEG-Y format 

template (Figure 22) in SPW, which will be used to build the index file. SPW already has a SEG-Y 

standard format template, but it is often necessary to change some header values stored in non-

standard positions. This was the case for the medium size dataset used in this work, because it 



 

35 
 

was retrieved after preliminary processing with the RadEx Pro software, which changed the byte 

locations of the inline and crossline, CMP Easting and CMP northing (these had to be corrected 

and are highlighted by the red rectangles in Figure 22) The medium size dataset has 7978 inlines 

and 117 crosslines.  

In a new phase of the tests, it was used larger input file which came directly from the seismic data 

acquisition (B27H27 seismic block with 462 GB). This large size dataset has 771366 number of 

records, which corresponds to the number of shots; 192 traces per record which corresponds to 

the number of channels / receivers for each shot - since there are two seismic sources, 96 

channels*2 sources=192; 1500 the samples per trace; and 0.100 ms the sample interval. 

                                   

 

Figure 22.  SEG-Y Template in SPW for the medium size seismic dataset, after correction of the header values to their 

standard byte location, since these had been swapped in the output SEG-Y file from the RadEx Pro software. 

 

 

4.2.2 CMP Binning Flow with Flex Binning 

The CMP Binning process in SPW assigns CMP line and location numbers according to user 

specified coordinate parameters. If a 2D survey is specified, the user is prompted to define the 

line. If a 3D survey is specified, the user will be prompted to define the grid. 

 

 



 

36 
 

The option of Flex Binning allows each bin to contain more traces, by increasing the effective size 

of each bin and by including traces which fall into neighboring bins. The amount of Flex can also 

be proportional to the trace offset. The Flex traces may be added immediately to the output data 

flow, or else their locations can be written into a Flex file. This option allows stacking the Flex 

traces without extra sorting.  

The CMP Binning flow is composed of an Input file (seismic data in any sort order), the CMP 

Binning processing step, a CMP Flex Locations card and an Output file with any sort order (Figure 

23). 

 

Figure 23. Example CMP Binning Flowchart  
 

 

Input File 

The input seismic file for the first tests with the medium size dataset after corrections to the 

header values is shown in Figure 24, where we can observe: the number of records (363244), 

which corresponds to the number of shots; the traces per record (192) which corresponds to the 

number of channels / receivers for each shot - since there are two seismic sources, 96 channels*2 

sources=192; the number of traces (33556726); the samples per trace (1500); and the sample 

interval (0.1000ms).

CMP Binning Processing Step 

To implement the CMP Binning step, it is necessary to fill in the parameters inside the CMP 

Binning window shown in Figure 25. The parameters are: grid definition, coordinate definition, 

survey dimensions, project updates, Binning type specification, Flex Binning specification and 

input header coordinates. The coordinates of the grid (3D survey area) are inserted by defining 

three of its corners, which are: 

? Corner 1 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the first corner of the survey. 

? Corner 1 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the first corner of the survey. 

? Corner 2 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the second corner of the survey. 

? Corner 2 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the second corner of the survey 

? Corner 3 Easting: Enter the easting (x) coordinate of the third corner of the survey. 

? Corner 3 Northing: Enter the northing (y) coordinate of the third corner of the survey. 



 

38 
 

 

Figure 25. Step parameters for the CMP Binning window 

 

For the grid definition, it is essential also to insert: 

? the Inline bin size: Enter the size in distance units of the inline side of each bin.  

? the Crossline bin size: Enter the size in distance units of the crossline side of each bin. 

? the First inline number: Enter the first inline number. This line number is assigned to all 

the bins along the side of the survey from corner 1 to corner 2.  

? the Inline increment: Enter the increment in line numbers between adjacent CMP lines.  

? First crossline number: Enter the first crossline number. This location number is assigned 

to all the bins along the side of the survey from corner 1 to corner 3.  

? the Crossline increment: Enter the increment in locations between adjacent CMP 

locations. 



 

39 
 

The coordinate definition, specifies whether the corner points define the bin centres or corners, 

explicitly: 

? Corner points define bin centres: Select to specify that corner points define bin centres. It 

is used this coordinate definition (Figure 26).  

? Corner points define bin corners: Select to specify that corner points define bin corners.  

 

Figure 26. Coordinate definition in SPW. 

 

The survey dimensions need also to be specified both for 2D and 3D, namely: 

? 2D: Select to specify 2D line survey dimensions.  

? 3D: Select to specify 3D grid survey dimensions (the case of this work). 

?  

In SPW it is possible to make updates from the project: 

? Update from project: Select to update from the project.  

? Update project: Select to update the project. 



 

40 
 

 The Binning type specification, can be as follows: 

? No Flex Binning: Select standard Binning, with no extra traces added.  

? Output Flex traces directly: Select to add Flex traces to the output binned traces.  

? Output Flex locations to a Flex file: Select to add the locations of Flex traces to an 

additional output Flex file. This is the way to get an output Flex location that is going to be 

used for Flex data, in Bin Fold Limit. 

The input header coordinates were implemented when SPW version 2 was released and were 

improved in version 3. With the input header coordinates it is possible to specify whether the 

Header coordinates of the input are Source and Receiver XYs or CMP XYs and Offset: 

? Source and Receiver XYs: Select to specify that the trace midpoint position and trace 

offset will both be calculated from the Source Easting and Northing and the Receiver 

Easting and Northing trace headers. 

? CMP XYs and Offset: Select to specify that trace midpoint position will be taken from the 

trace headers CMP Easting and CMP Northing, and the offset will be taken from the offset 

header. 

The Flex Binning specification (Figure 27) allows choosing the standard Binning or the type of Flex 

Binning required: 

? Inline % bin Flex: Specify the percentage increase of each bin size in the inline direction to 

include extra ‘Flex’ traces. 

? Crossline % bin Flex: Specify the percentage increase of each bin size in the crossline 

direction to include extra ‘Flex’ traces. 

? Inline % Offset Flex: Specify the increase of each bin size as the percentage increase of 

the trace inline offsets. 

? Crossline % Offset Flex: Specify the increase of each bin size as the percentage increase of 

the trace crossline offsets. 



 

41 
 

 

Figure 27. Diagram representing how % Flex works on the data. 

The Flex Binnig is done in the CMP domain. The mid-point of every trace from a shot to a receiver 

is assigned to the CMP bin which contains that mid-point.  The bins making up the survey area are 

all rectangular. With Flex Binning, each bin is larger than the standard non-Flex bin size. A 20 % -

20 % bin Flex means that the length of each bin (in-line size) and the width of each bin (cross-line 

size) are 20% longer each than the standard bin length and width. 

Therefore, if the standard bin size is 1m X 1m, 100% Flex would be taken as meaning the Flex bin 

size is 2m X 2m (i.e. increased by 100%). The distance to each of the bin boundary lines from the 

bin centre, would have increased from 0.5m to 1m. Each trace in this case can be expected to land 

in four different bins – one being its standard nearest non-Flex bin, and the other three in 

neighboring Flex-bins. This of course depends on whether the trace mid-point falls in the centre or 

near the edge of the survey.  In the case of a % Flex in each direction which is not a multiple of 

100%, or if the in-line and cross-line Flex %s are different, the number of Flex bins that a trace falls 

into will vary depending on its exact location. 

 

 



 

42 
 

Output File 

The output CMP binned dataset will contain only the original traces which fall within the survey 

area if you set to drop out dead traces and already had the grid implemented according to the 

parameters established by CMP Binning card. It won’t contain Flex traces. The output seismic file 

from the CMP Binning flow appears with trace headers Inline and Crossline, in the same position 

of the CMP Line Location and CMP Location, respectively. 

 

CMP Flex Location Output Card (Flex Table)  

The Flex table is filled in by the Flex locations from the 3D dataset. Although it was suggested that 

this output file should be in a text format, this has not yet been accomplished by the software 

development team and the output Flex Table is still at present in an image format. Thanks to 

some of the suggestions proposed it is nevertheless now possible to open the CMP Flex Locations 

dialog box and see how the file has been filled in (Figure 28). It is also now possible to save the 

Flex file location in a Flex File format, but again not yet in a table format.  

The Flex table parameters that can be checked are: 

? Currents Records: Lowest and highest input trace numbers (ID), and the ranges of CMP 

lines and locations (first and the last CMP lines/ CMP locations) written should be stored 

in the file header.  

? Flex Binning Specification: Write the specification that was stable before in the CMP 

Binning step (Inline % bin Flex, Crossline % bin Flex, Inline % Offset Flex and Crossline % 

Offset Flex). 

 

Two further options that were requested and are now available in the latest software version, are: 

?  “Append to existing dataset”: to continue adding Flex locations to the specified Flex file. 

Otherwise if the specified Flex file exists it will be renamed with the addition of 

suffix’_copy’ and a new file of the specified name opened. 



 

43 
 

? “Scan File”: to read through the file and check that the reported record statistics are 

correct. Warning: for large files this process can take considerable time. 

When the CMP Binning flowchart is run, the CMP Flex Location cart is filled with Current Records 

and Flex Binning Specification.  

 

Figure 28. CMP Flex Location dialog window. 

 

4.2.3 Bin Fold Limit Flow   

The Bin Fold Limit Flow (Figure 29) adds extra Flex traces to the input binned data from an input 

Flex table. The Flex traces are selected from the Flex table locations as specified by the Bin Fold 

Limit parameters. The output is the 3D Seismic data sorted by CMP Line and CMP Location. The 

input parameters are: 



 

44 
 

1) 3D Seismic data sorted by CMP Line and CMP Location, with CMP Location as the record 

key (mandatory). 

2) A Flex Table generated as the output of CMP Binning, with Flex trace location data.

45 
 

Trace selection Method: The trace selection method specifies the criterion by which traces are 

selected from both the input data and the Flex traces.  

? Nearest to within bin: Select to specify that the traces selected for each bin will be those 

within the bin plus those closest to the bin boundary, subject to the specified maximum 

fold. If removal of non-Flex traces (i.e. Those within the bin) is allowed, the traces selected 

will be those closest to the bin centre. If checked, traces will be selected for inclusion in a 

bin by their distances from the bin boundary. 

? Nearest to bin centre: Select to specify that the traces selected for each bin will be those 

within the bin plus those closest to the bin centre, subject to the specified maximum fold. 

If removal of non-Flex traces (i.e. Those within the bin) is allowed, the traces selected will 

be those closest to the bin centre. If checked, traces will be selected for inclusion in a bin 

by their distances from the centre of the bin. 

? One trace per offset interval: This option aims to provide a full range of offsets within 

each bin by allowing just one trace per offset interval. This option can be overridden, if 

necessary, using Override offset interval and selecting the desired number of traces per 

offset interval. 

The CMP maximum fold: this does not apply when traces are selected for inclusion in a bin of one 

trace per offset interval. Otherwise, it is possible to choose: 

? Maximum traces per bin: Specify the total number of traces that may be included in each 

bin. 

? Allow removal of non-Flex traces: If checked, and there are more (non-Flex) traces 

assigned to a bin than the specified Maximum traces per bin; then, those farthest from 

the bin centre will be removed.  If not checked, only Flex traces which fall within the box 

will be de-selected. 

If the diagnostic print is selected, traces with mid-points within a bin will be removed if necessary 

to maintain the selected maximum fold. If not checked, these traces will not be removed, even if 

specified maximum fold is exceeded.

4.2.4 Flex coverage map  

Another missing item that was requested to be implemented was a map with the Flex location.  In 

the latest version however, the Flex location file format was changed and therefore old format 

Flex location files cannot be used anymore and only Flex location files created with the newer 

version can now be used to build the map from Flex File. The plotting routine used to create the 

Flex coverage maps is the same that was used in SPW to plot the fold coverage map. If the offset 

increment when plotting a fold map from a Flex file is not 1, it will not work, and the software will 

probably crashes. The SPW team tried to fix this, and put also reporting the offsets range on the 

Flex file dialog. This is a nice feature to have when plotting fold maps with different offsets. The 

new parameters of Flex map (Figure 31) are described below. As concerns the Flex Locations file, 

an output file from the CMP Binning flow with output Flex locations should be used.  

 

Figure 31. Dialog box to generate fold maps from a Flex Location File. 
 

The trace selection method specifies whether standard binned traces (no Flex traces) or Flex-

binned data (include Flex traces) are to be used to generate the fold map: 

? No Flex traces: Select to specify that only the traces assigned to CMP bins without Flex-

Binning will be included. 



 

47 
 

? Include Flex traces: Select to specify that all normally CMP-binned plus the Flex-binned 

traces will be included. 

The map display type specifies whether the output map is to be a binary coverage map (1=bin has 

at least one trace), or a fold map: 

? Coverage: Select Coverage to specify that a CMP bin will be given a value of 1 if at least 

one trace is assigned to it. 

? Fold: Select Fold to specify that CMP bin will be given a value equal to the number of 

traces assigned to it. 

The offset specification allows selecting whether to include all offsets, or just ones of a selected 

offsets range: 

? Include all offsets: Select to specify that the traces at all offsets will be included in the 

bins displayed on the output map. 

? Specify an offset: Select to specify an offset and an offset interval which will restrict the 

traces included in the bins on the output map. 

 
The offset specification is made by the offset range for inclusion of traces.  

? Offset: Specify the offset of trace to include in Binning on the output map. 

? Offset interval: Specify the offset interval to use. 

? Update: Specify the offset range for inclusion of traces. 

 
The map title by default will be the project name, but the user may modify this name if required. 

The map label by default will be text made from the specified parameters for easy reference, but 

the user may modify this if required.  

Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to make a fold/coverage map from a large Flex location file, 

because when we attempt to create the map from a Flex Locations File with 35.4 GB, the SPW 

closes without creating any dump file, or error message. Maybe this happens because the file is 

very big and the computer cannot find enough memory to allocate the map to be displayed. The 

size of Flex Locations File generated by this process was 2.37 GB and the same problem always 

happens. This problem still needs to be solved.

4.3 Beta testing, problems encountered and solutions 

adopted 

In this section, the tests carried out in the scope of this work to analyze the performance of the 

Flex Binning Codes, detect problems and propose solutions are described. As stated above, these 

tests were first carried out on a medium size dataset to determine the main problems in the Flex 

routines and try to solve them, if possible avoiding too long computational times and severe 

memory issues (in some cases even just a portion of the medium size dataset was used for faster 

testing and solution implementation). Once the main issues were identified and largely solved, a 

new set of tests were performed in the Large Size Dataset to assess the full functionality of the 

application of Flex Binning. All the tests were performed on a Windows Workstation with an i7-

6700 (3.4GHz) processor with four cores, 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD (a high speed access disk). 

 

4.3.1 Beta Tests of the Flex Binning Routines 

with the Medium Size dataset 

During the Beta Testing of the Flex routines, several problems were encountered, both code 

issues and bugs. The inputs used in the Beta Testing have a large number of traces and headers, 

which influences the performance of the SPW, the computer hardware limits, and the processing 

time. 

At the beginning of the CMP Binning flow tests the medium size dataset (with 209 GB) was used 

(see details in Section 4.2.1 and Figure 24 in Section 4.2.2).  The CMP Binning flow did not run and 

the software crashed. The indexing of the output from the CMP Binning flow was not written. 

After many tests with numerous versions of SPW to attempt to solve this problem, the CMP 

Binning flow code was finally corrected and is now able to run without any error message and to 

write correctly the index output file. The total elapsed time was 8 hours, 31 minutes, 53 seconds, 

for a 200% Flex Binning.  The memory used when the CMP Binning flow was running was 

approximately 40-99%. It was discovered that until 70% of the processing job, the memory used 

was fine (around the 50%), but after running 70% of the job, the memory usage increased 

significantly; for example, after 79% of the job was completed, the memory used stabilized in 98-



 

49 
 

99% until the end (Figures 32 A and B). This high memory usage has led us to detect hardware 

problems caused by the software limitations. 

In order to test where the problem was coming from, the same flow was run again, but without 

writing the output Flex location file; in this case, the memory used behaved very well, and did not 

exceed 28%-50% (Figures 33 A and B). These results obtained with the medium size dataset (209 

GB) showed that the problem was related to the writing of the output file and they were sent to 

the SPW software development team to try to solve this problem.

job, the memory was fine. B) After running 79% of the job, the memory usage suddenly increased to 99%.

51 
 

To start realizing how the % bin Flex that was used could influence the time efficiency of 

processing, the same input was used, but with a slight change in the CMP Binning flow. This slight 

change was the % bin Flex chosen which was now slightly higher (250% bin Flex in inlines and 

crosslines). The total elapsed computing time was 9 hours, 17 minutes, 46 seconds. In comparison 

to the same job that was run with the 200% bin Flex in inlines and crosslines, the flow with 250% 

bin Flex in inlines and crosslines took approximately 10% more time to run when a 25% larger 

percentage of bin Flex was selected. 

 

4.3.2 Beta Tests of the Flex Binning Routines 

with the Large Size Dataset  

With the improvement of the of Flex routines code, it was then possible to move to a new phase 

of the tests, namely using a much larger input file which came directly from the seismic data 

acquisition (see details in Section 4.2.1). The input file was now 462 GB and the CMP Binning flow 

did not run and error messages appeared. The error messages that came up while processing 

record 1 of 5962 was “Error: The trace header CMP Eastings and Northings header values are bad 

or do not conform to the survey. Correct headers or survey corners and resubmit; Processed 1 

records; error writing index file trace sort list - QFileDevice Error code 0; Error while writing the 

index file: B27H27_after_cmpBinning.sgy”. 

Therefore, in the input merged file it is necessary to first remove the bad traces. The Kill Traces 

step was chosen to try to solve this problem (Figure 34 and Figure 35), but it did not work.  

 

Figure 34. Experimental flow using the Kill traces step. 



 

52 
 

 

Figure 35. Experimental Kill traces card. 
 

The solution for this problem, implemented in the SPW software consisted in setting the traces 

outside the specified area (grid), due to incorrect coordinates, as dead traces, and flag them so 

that these are not included in the output seismic file. After this correction, it was possible to run 

the CMP Binning flow with bad traces or traces outside the grid, but still the flow still did not work 

successfully.  

A new error message now appears when the flow running: “**Warning: Unable to allocate 

memory for TraceHeadersList-&gt;ItsTraceHeaderArray in ScanSegyHeader”. This error message 

means that we are running out of memory for the trace header list which was used to build the 

index file. Solving this problem required some software design changes. The new updated version 

of SPW included changes made to the index file and now the index file is created at the end of the 

processing so that there will be a pause and scan of the data file before the “Processing Complete” 

message appears. This way, the SEG-Y output is always completed and the index which requires 

substantial memory is created as a read after write operation on the output file, without the 

memory failures that were happening due to the large size of the input file. 

After the software design changes described above, the CMP Binning flow now runs without any 

error message and the program does not crash. The total running time was 14 hours, 25 minutes, 

7 seconds, for 200% Flex bin and the memory usage did not exceed approximately 50% (Figure 36). 

In CMP Binning flow the input file is generally larger than the output file, because when the CMP 

Binning is applied, a 3D grid is defined and all traces outside the selected grid are considered as 

dead traces and removed. As before, the same CMP Binning flow was run again, but in this time 

with a percentage of bin Flex of 250%. The memory used still remains quite low (Figure 37) and 

the total elapsed time was now 16 hours, 6 minutes and 23 seconds. In comparison to the same 

job that was run with the 200% bin Flex in inlines and crosslines, the flow with 250% bin Flex in 

inlines and crosslines took approximately 12% more time to run when a 25% larger percentage of 

bin Flex was selected, similar to the results obtained from the medium size dataset.

54 
 

In the final phase of this work, it was possible to run the CMP Binning flow for the largest dataset 

acquired in the survey area (751GB), with the final SPW version after all the testing, suggested 

corrections and solutions implemented. The CMP Binning flow was able to run without any error 

messages and the software did not crash. The total running time for this dataset was 22 hours, 26 

minutes, 11 seconds. The memory usage did not also exceed 55% (Figure 38). 

 

Figure 38. The memory used by computer, when ran the CMP Binning with the largest dataset of the survey area. 
 

After fully testing and successfully solving all the problems associated with the CMP Binning Flex 

mode flow, a final test was carried out on the Bin Fold Limit flow. The trace selection method 

which was used in the CMP Fold Limit dialog box, was one trace per offset interval, which means 

assigning a trace to each bin, and not to have a regular fold. Some problems were detected in the 

Bin Fold Limit flow, with a set of error messages displayed: 

“*** Error: Mismatch - First In-line on file is 1; *** Error: Mismatch - First Cross line on file is 17 

*** Error: Cmp Flex Locations survey parameters do not match this data. Please remake the file. 

*** Error: job initialization failed for process: Bin Fold Limit”  



 

55 
 

These Bin Fold Limit flow error messages are caused by the fact that the SPW team had to add 

some extra information to the Flex locations file to solve the issues detected during the execution 

of this work and these required changes in all subsequent flows. Also, at present, the Bin Fold 

Limit flow is also using too much memory while running (Figure 39), which also requires some 

extra software adjustments. More beta testing of this flow is now required.

5.  Results and Discussion 

The Flex Binning routines, after all the tests performed and the resolution of detected bugs and 

code problems, is now working, which was one the main aims of this work. However, the Bin Fold 

Limit routine can still only be applied successfully to small datasets. For larger datasets, at present, 

the only solution is to cut them into small datasets, apply the Flex Binning by parts, and then 

merge the files, before performing the remaining processing steps.  

In this Chapter, we show an example of the application of the Flex Binning to a portion of a 3D 

block from the study area, in which where the presence of data gaps is evident, to assess its 

performance. 

 

5.1 Application of Flex Binning to a UHRS dataset 

Next, we show an example of the application of the Flex Binning to a portion of a 3D block from 

the study area, in which where the presence of data gaps is evident (Figure 40). The bin size for 

this block is 1mx1m.

Binning. A) Time slice display. B) Display of an ILine showing the data gaps.

This block was used to test Flex Binning with the aim to fill all the gaps which exist with the option 

of only one trace per bin. In order to get the images represented in Figure 41, Figure 42 and Figure 

43 it was necessary to implement different % bin Flex for each seismic section. First, just to get an 

idea of the damage that can result when a too large flex percentage is used, a Flex bin percentage 

of 2000% (Flex Bin size of 21m x 21m) was assigned in both directions (crossline and inline). As can 

be observed in Figure 41, the result is not good. Overlap of many shots, leads to the distortion of 

the seismic data, causing a severe loss of resolution.

portion where is evident the presence of data gaps. A) Depth slice display. B) Display crossline. As can be observed 

there are no data gaps but there was a severe loss of resolution due to the choice of a too large Flex Bin percentage. 
 

Next, a Flex Binning of 200% was used in both directions (Figure 42); this means that the Flex Bin 

size is now 3m x 3m, and therefore the new bin radius is 1.5m (see Figure 43). In this case, the 

Flex Binning fills in most of the gaps, but there still exist some gaps in the seismic data.

Finally, a percentage bin Flex of 235 was used for both directions and the Flex Binning works very 

well, because it fills all the data gaps with an adequate seismic resolution (Figure 44). For a 235 % 

bin Flex, the Flex Bin size is 3.35m x 3.35m. In this case, the original bin radius of 0.5m increased 

to approximately 1.7m.

5.2 Discussion 

The challenge of the present work was to apply Flex Binning to very large ultra high resolution 

seismic (UHRS) datasets, in which the number of traces largely exceeded the available software 

design solutions and hardware capability. The implementation of an efficient and reliable Flex 

Binning to be applied to the data as soon as possible after data acquisition, if possible in the field, 

is a crucial step in industry as it will allow to assess the potential need or not to acquire new data 

before leaving the survey area. The SEG Y files used in the beta testing performed in the scope of 

this work contained more traces than the expected in a conventional seismic dataset, which 

highlighted software limitations, since SPW was not prepared for such data size. Besides the 

number of traces, there are at least 26 headers for each trace. This causes extra difficulties in the 

performance of the SPW, the computer hardware limits and time efficiency of processing. 

Beta testing of the CMP Binning flow in different size datasets allowed code efficiency issues and 

software bugs to be detected, which allowed advances in the implementation of Flex Binning for 

large inputs, namely the successful execution the flow to a dataset with 751GB, which was a 

A)

61 
 

major step forward. Before this work and tests, it was only possible to effectively apply Flex 

Binning to an input dataset with a size not greater than approximately 30 GB.  

To successfully implement the CMP Binning step to a dataset with a substantial number of traces, 

one of the major issues was the inability to apply a grid to the dataset and leave traces out of the 

grid. The traces outside the specified area (grid) are now set as dead traces, and it is possible to 

flag those traces, so that the output seismic file does not include them. 

Indexing was another issue which was solved by a change of software design in the CMP Binning 

code. The index problem consisted in the fact that the flow is running out of memory for the trace 

header list used to build the index file. The SPW team worked for to overcome this problem, 

creating an updated version of SPW which enables the index file to be created at the end of the 

processing, so that there will be a pause and scan of the data file before the “Processing Complete” 

message appears. This way, the SEG Y file is always completed and the index, which requires 

substantial memory, is created as a read after write operation on the output file, without the 

memory failures that were happening before due to the large dataset being processed. 

Another critical issue that was solved concerns the memory usage in run time. In the first tests of 

the CMP Binning flow, the memory used by the computer was approximately 90%, but with the 

code improvement, now running the CMP Binning step with a large input only takes about 50% of 

the memory of the computer.  

The time efficiency of processing is also very important. Beta testing allowed understanding how 

the processing time for different input files varies. The processing time can reach 22 hours, 26 

minutes, 11 seconds for an input dataset with 751 GB, to get the Flex File Location card and the 

seismic output with the grid implemented. 

Remaining issues to be solved include: 

? The Bin Fold Limit flow adds Flex traces to the input binned data from an input Flex table. 

Due software design changes in the Flex Location File, the Bin Fold Limit flow does not yet 

work very well. This needs to be addressed. 

? The map with the Flex location still does not work, because when we try to create the 

map from a Flex Locations File even with a relatively small dataset, some error messages 

still appear and SPW closes without any dump file. More testing on the Bin Fold Limit flow 

and generated Flex locations map is needed.

6.  Conclusions 

In general, the main objectives of this thesis were achieved. The main aim, which was to make the 

application of Flex Binning to large Ultra High Resolution Seismic Datasets a reality, by testing the 

existing software, detecting bugs and code issues and collaborating with the SPW development 

team on solving these issues, was completed. Finally, testing the application of the latest Flex 

Binning Flow to the largest dataset available in Geosurveys has proven a major step forward as it 

demonstrated the feasibility to use this method in the field just after data acquisition, which may 

save considerable time and money. 

Gaps in 3D data cause highly adverse impacts in several steps of the data processing, making it 

impossible to obtain a final processed migrated volume. In the context of the implementation of 

Monopile foundations for offshore wind farms it is fundamental to be able to detect faults, 

boulders and other geological structures which represent a risk for the Monopile foundations 

implementation. Offshore wind farms are gaining popularity in the world and due to the current 

interest in the need for greener energy sources, security of energy supply and the public’s 

reluctance to have wind farms on-shore. Efficient high resolution methods and quick ways to test 

the adequacy of the acquired data or the need to re-run parts of the survey as early as possible 

are fundamental. 

The Flex Binning method is simple and fast when compared with alternative solutions (statistical 

interpolation and regularization) and therefore less expensive. The principle behind this step was 

used to correct navigation problems and feathering movements of the streamer during 

acquisition, because the Flex Binning can be a solution for irregular acquisition geometry. 

Several tests were performed on the Seismic Processing Workshop software to accomplish the 

purpose of this work. Beta testing on CMP Binning flow allowed advances in the implementation 

of Flex Binning to large inputs, namely the execution this flow successfully to a dataset with 

751GB. The Beta testing on SPW permitted to find problems in the code, and solve most of them. 

The issue of creating a map with the Flex location is already underway, but more work is still 

needed to solve it; and the same goes for the implementation of the Bin Fold Limit flow. 

A good data Flex Binning is one which when applied to the dataset allows filling in the coverage 

gaps, without distorting the seismic data and without loss of resolution. The amounts of coverage 

gaps will influence the percentage which is to be used for the Flex bin. More data gaps require 



 

64 
 

larger flex percentages. High values of % Flex bin means that the search area will be also large. If 

the Flex trace search area is too large, then the greater the number of traces that are borrowed 

from neighboring bins and there will be significant amounts of traces to fill empty bins that may 

not to reliable estimates of the missing data. Due to this fact, the ability to distinguish seismic 

events can be lost, which leads to loss of seismic resolution making it impossible to detect small 

geological structures such as boulders, with potential risks for the Monopile foundations. 

Consequently, it is necessary to use common sense and care when using the Flex Binning, when 

the final product of seismic processing requires high seismic resolution. 

In Future work, it is essential to continue to improve the code and beta testing of the CMP Binning 

flow, the Bin Fold Limit flow and generate fold maps from Flex File. The bin expansion in SPW 

should take the form of an ellipse in the future, where the shortest part is the direction of 

acquisition, thus allowing greater collection of traces. 

The implementation of the Flex Binning in real-time during acquisition together with QC also in 

real time is now the goal for the future. This great advance will permit to reduce the infill/reruns 

made during the acquisition, to fill the gaps data, allowing to control the acquisition costs.
