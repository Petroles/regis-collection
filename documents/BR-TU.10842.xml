SUMMARY

Inadequate usage can degrade natural resources, particularly soils.  More
attention has been paid to practices aiming at the recovery of degraded soils in the
last years, e.g, the use of organic fertilizers, liming and introduction of species
adapted to adverse conditions.  The purpose of this study was therefore to
investigate the recovery of physical properties of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) degraded
by the construction of a hydroelectric power station.  In the study area, a soil layer
about 8m thick had been withdrawn by heavy machines leading not only to soil
compaction, but resulting in high-degree degradation.  The experiment was
arranged in a completely randomized design with nine treatments and four
replications.  The treatments consisted of: 1- soil mobilization by tilling (to ensure
the effect of mechanical mobilization in all treatments) without planting, but growth
of spontaneous vegetation; 2- Black velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp;amp;
Tracy); 3- Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) DC); 4- Liming + black velvet bean; 5-
Liming + pigeonpea until 1994, when replaced by jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis);
6- Liming + gypsum + black velvet bean; 7- Liming + gypsum + pigeonpea until 1994,
when replaced by jack bean; and two controls as reference: 8- Native Cerrado
vegetation and 9- bare soil (no tilling and no planting), left under natural conditions
and in this situation, without spontaneous vegetation.  In treatments 1 through 7,
the soil was tilled.  Treatments were installed in 1992 and left unmanaged for
seven years, until brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens) was planted in all plots in
1999.  Seventeen years after implantation, the properties soil macroporosity,
microporosity, total porosity, bulk density and aggregate stability were assessed
in the previously described treatments in the soil layers 0.00–0.10; 0.10–0.20 and
0.20–0.40 m, and soil Penetration Resistance and soil moisture in 0.00–0.15 and
0.15–0.30 m.  The plants were evaluated for: brachiaria dry matter and spontaneous
growth of native tree species in the plots as of 2006.  Results were analyzed by

variance analysis and Tukey´s test at 5 % for mean comparison.  In all treatments,
except for the bare soil (no recovery measures), ongoing recovery of the degraded
soil physical properties was observed.  Macroporosity, soil bulk density and total
porosity were good soil quality indicators.  The occurrence of spontaneous native
species indicated the soil recovery process.  The best adapted species was
Machaerium acutifolium Vogel, with the largest number of plants and most
advanced development; the dry matter production of B.  decumbens in recovering
soil was similar to normal conditions, evidencing soil recovery.

Index terms: soil bulk density, total porosity, soil degradation, soil quality.

RESUMO:        RECUPERAÇÃO DAS PROPRIEDADES FÍSICAS DO SOLO POR
MEIO DE ADUBOS VERDES, CALAGEM, GESSO, PASTAGEM E
ESPÉCIES DE OCORRÊNCIA ESPONTÂNEA

O uso inadequado pode degradar os recursos naturais, sobretudo o solo.  Práticas visando
à recuperação de solos degradados têm recebido mais atenção nos últimos anos, por meio do
uso de adubos orgânicos, correção do solo e implantação de espécies adequadas às condições
adversas.  Nesse sentido, desenvolveu-se o presente trabalho com o objetivo de investigar a
recuperação das propriedades físicas de um Latossolo Vermelho degradado devido à construção
de usina hidrelétrica.  Na área estudada, foi retirada uma camada de solo de aproximadamente
8 m de espessura, com o uso de máquinas pesadas, o que causou compactação do solo,
caracterizando alto grau de degradação.  O delineamento experimental utilizado foi
inteiramente casualizado, com nove tratamentos e quatro repetições.  Os tratamentos foram:
1-solo mobilizado pelo preparo (para se obter o efeito mecânico da mobilização em todos os
tratamentos) e sem plantio, deixando a ocorrência de vegetação espontânea; 2-mucuna-preta
(Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp;amp; Tracy); 3-guandu (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) até 1994,
sendo depois substituído por feijão-de-porco (Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC); 4-
calcário+mucuna-preta; 5–calcário+guandu até 1994, sendo depois substituído por feijão-de-
porco; 6-calcário+gesso+mucuna-preta; 7-calcário+gesso+guandu até 1994, sendo depois
substituído por feijão-de-porco; e, para controle, duas testemunhas, sendo: 8-vegetação nativa
de Cerrado e 9-solo exposto (sem mobilização pelo preparo e sem plantio), deixado nas condições
naturais e, nessa situação, sem vegetação espontânea.  Nos tratamentos 1 a 7 o solo foi
mobilizado pelo preparo.  Os tratamentos foram instalados em 1992 e permaneceram por sete
anos, até que em 1999 implantou-se Brachiaria decumbens em todas as parcelas
experimentais.  Após 17 anos de implantados os tratamentos descritos, foram avaliadas as
propriedades: macroporosidade, microporosidade, porosidade total, densidade do solo e
estabilidade de agregados nas camadas de 0,00–0,10, 0,10–0,20 e 0,20–0,40 m, resistência do
solo à penetração e umidade do solo (0,00–0,15 e 0,15–0,30 m).  Com relação às plantas,
foram avaliados a massa seca da braquiária e o crescimento das espécies arbóreas nativas que
surgiram espontaneamente nas parcelas experimentais, sendo notadas a partir de 2006.  Os
resultados foram analisados efetuando-se a análise de variância e o teste de Tukey a 5 % para
comparação de médias.  Todos os tratamentos adotados, com exceção do solo exposto (sem
intervenção para a sua recuperação), estão recuperando as propriedades físicas do solo
degradado.  A macroporosidade, densidade do solo e porosidade total foram bons indicadores
da qualidade do solo.  A ocorrência de espécies nativas espontâneas foi um indicativo do
processo de recuperação do solo, e a espécie Machaerium acutifolium Vogel foi a mais adaptada,
pelo maior número de plantas e maior desenvolvimento; a produção de massa seca de Brachiaria
decumbens no solo em recuperação foi semelhante à do solo sob condição natural, atestando a
sua recuperação.

Termos de indexação: densidade do solo, porosidade do solo, degradação do solo, qualidade do
solo.

INTRODUCTION

Due to population growth and, consequently,
economical development, environmental resources
have been widely affected in the last decades.

Currently, of the natural resources degraded by
anthropic actions, the natural characteristics of soil
have been the most affected, mainly by inadequate
exploration.  The history of soil use shows that these
alterations are not always followed by a new

sustainable ecological system and that soils under
intensive and improper use will be degraded (Alves &amp;amp;
Souza, 2008).

For the maintenance and improvement of the soil
physical conditions, the addition and positive balance
of organic matter is fundamental, based on the supply
of organic matter, root action, macro- and
microbiological activities and decomposition of organic
matter (Alves, 1992).

In the recovery of a degraded soil the great
challenge is the formation of a new horizon A,
underlying the reestablishment of the surface layer
and of other horizons (Noffs, 2000).

Vezzani &amp;amp; Mielniczuk (2009) report that Brazilian
researchers are seeking for more adequate soil quality
indicators, proposing indicators related to physical
(Alves et al., 2007), chemical (Ribeiro et al., 2007),
and biological (Vargas &amp;amp; Scholles, 2000) properties or
a range of intergrated indicators (Araújo et al., 2007).
These indicators are chosen according to the ease of
use, and infrastructure and economic conditions.  It
is important to remember that a set of indicators is
the most adequate option for a safe diagnosis.

The biological diversity and the intensity and
duration of disturbances determine the resilience of
ecosystems.  Ecosystem restoration is the term
attributed to the challenge to, by means of planned
actions, recover soil structure – one of the fundamental
conditions for restoration success – and consequently,
improve aeration, mass/volume ratio, and soil water
retention.  This will create, the physical conditions
for the re-establishment, also, of natural ecological
processes, i.e., seed germination, seedling emergence
and development, and return of vegetable residues to
the soil, an energy source for soil organisms (Alves et
al., 2007).  In this context, Reis &amp;amp; Kageyama (2003)
add that crop succession is a complex and concomitant
process, which improves soil conditions, the
microclimate, as well as the diversity of flora, fauna
and also decomposers.

Resilience represents the capacity of an ecosystem
for regeneration after some natural or anthropogenic
degradation (Aronson et al., 1994).  The resilience of
degraded areas is very low or nearly inexistent, due
to the elimination of the means of natural
regeneration, i.e., the soil seed bank and surface layer
(Kageyama et al., 1992).  In this case, restoration is a
slow and difficult process, requiring a careful choice
of plants with high growth capacity and good
development in these degraded environments, as well
as the use of soil management practices which support
their recovery (Alves et al., 2007).

A number of techniques are used for restoration of
degraded soils; most of them combine mechanical
practices, to break up compact layers, with the input
of organic matter.  Alves et al. (2007); Kitamura et
al. (2008) and Campos &amp;amp; Alves (2008) reported
improved soil quality by means of addition of organic

matter (using green manure, sewage sludge) and
confirmed the beneficial effects on the soil physical
proprieties (bulk density, total porosity and
macroporosity), in other words, a decrease in soil bulk
density and increase in total porosity and
macroporosity, as well as a better development of
plants.

The problem of degradation in the study area was
a consequence of the construction of the Hydroelectric
Power Station Ilha Solteira, in São Paulo.  Although
power generation by water is considered one of the
least harmful solutions, the dam constructions tend
to cause strong degradation in many surrounding
areas evidenced by, e.g., the withdrawal of vegetation
and soil layers, as well as flooding.  Therefore, among
the areas affected by the dam constructions, there
are “loan areas” (from which soil is removed for the
foundations of the dam wall), as well as unstable slopes
and wetlands, flooded areas, etc. (Alves &amp;amp; Souza, 2008).

Due to the impact generated by the large civil
constructions, it is necessary to develop techniques
and alternatives for the recovery of these
environments, where soil layers and the natural seed
bank had been removed.  Alves et al. (2007) studied
the soil recovery of an area degraded by a civil
construction, (hydroelectric plant), and concluded that
soil quality improvement is possible by tilling,
application of sewage sludge and green manuring, as
indicated by the increased porosity, lower bulk
density, improved water infiltration.  Kitamura et al.
(2008) reported the recovery of soil physical properties
(bulk density, macroporosity, total porosity, aggregate
stability) in another loan area degraded by soil removal
for dam construction and that soil bulk density was
the best physical indicator of the soil alterations.

In the search for solutions to the problems
involving soil restoration, efforts are being made to
identify the most adaptable species to the adverse
conditions, as well as their positive effects on the soil
proprieties, the recovery speed, and also to understand
the factors associated to the resilience of the area under
study, such as climate, water storage in the soil, and
the capability of development of planted or spontaneous
species.  In this sense, some physical properties of a
Red Latosol, under restoration for 17 years using green
manure, liming, gypsum and pasture were evaluated,
together with Brachiaria decumbens dry matter and
spontaneous occurrence of native tree species.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The study was conducted in a degraded area in
Selvíria, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, (latitude 20 o 22 ’
South, longitude 51 o 22 ’ West, altitude 327 m asl).  The
mean annual rainfall in the region is 1,370 mm,
temperature 23.5 oC and relative humidity between 70
and 80 %.  The soil in the study area, by the Brazilian
Soil Classification System is a dystrophic Red Latosol

(Demattê, 1980; Embrapa, 2006), corresponding to an
Oxisol by the US Soil Taxonomy.

From the area under study, a layer of 8.6 m had
been withdrawn from the original soil surface for the
construction of Hydroelectric Power Station Ilha
Solteira, leaving the bare subsoil of the area exposed
as of 1969 (Alves &amp;amp; Souza, 2008).  In 1992, the subsoil
was surface-compacted and a little spontaneous
vegetation had grown.  In that year, restoration work
was initiated.  First, tilling was performed by
subsoiling to an average depth of 0.41 m.  The soil
was also plowed and harrowed with leveling disks and
the soil analyzed physically and chemically: soil bulk
density = 1.76 kg dm-3; P = 0.5 mg dm-3; MO =
5.5 g dm-3; pH (CaCl2) = 4.1; K = 0.2 mmolc dm-3; Ca2+
= 0.2 mmolc dm-3; Mg2+ = 1.0 mmolc dm-3; sum of
bases = 3.2 mmolc dm-3; H + Al = 20.0 mmolc dm-3;
CEC = 23.2 mmolc dm-3 and V = 14 %.

Soil particle-size analysis determined 235 g kg-1
clay, 30 g kg-1 silt and 750 g kg-1 sand, in the soil under
natural vegetation.  In the loan area, after withdrawal
of a 8.6 m thick surface layer, 261 g kg-1 clay,
152 g kg-1 silt and 662 g kg-1 sand was found.  Under
both conditions, the textural soil class is sandy clay
loam.

Liming was based on the chemical characterization
of the experimental area.  Lime was applied to raise
base saturation to 70 %, and in the treatments which
included lime and gypsum, 25 % of lime CaO weas
replaced by 25 % of gypsum CaO, which were both
incorporated into the soil.

The green manure species (Stizolobium
aterrimum, Cajanus cajan and Canavalia ensiformis)
were sown by hand in December and January, from
1992 to 1996, at a density of 10 seeds m-2 and row
spacing of 0.50 m.  The green manure management
consisted of mowing the plants and leaving them on
the surface.

In 1996, four years after treatment installation,
the soil was limed again, based on chemical analysis,
only in the treatments with lime and lime + gypsum.

The substitution of lime by gypsum followed the same
procedure as described above.  Liming was applied to
raise base saturation to 70 % in the cases where it
was &amp;lt;60 %.

In January 1997, corn (Zea mays L.), an AG 405
hybrid, was sown in all experimental plots.
Fertilization consisted of 250 kg ha-1 4-30-10 NPK plus
0.3 % Zn, without liming.  In June 1998, black oat
(Avena strigosa Schieb) was also sown in all
experimental plots.  In February 1999, the forage grass
(Brachiaria decumbens Stapf.) was sown as soil
protection and to provide organic matter.  In 2006,
the presence of native Cerrado tree species was assessed.

The experiment had a completely randomized
design, consisting of nine treatments and four
replications.  A border of 2 m on all sides of each
10 x 10 m plot was disregarded (assessed area 64 m2)
and replications were 2 m apart from each other.

The treatments consisted of: (1) OT/B: soil tilling
without planting, allowing growth of spontaneous
vegetation, until 1999, followed by planting of
brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens); (2) SA/B: black
velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper &amp;amp; Tracy)
until 1999 and then replacement with brachiaria; (3)
CC/CE/B: Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) DC) until
1994, then replacement with jack bean (Canavalia
ensiformis), and as of 1999, replacement with
brachiaria; (4) L+SA/B: Liming + black velvet bean
until 1999, when replaced with brachiaria; (5) L+CC/
CE/B: Liming plus pigeonpea until 1994, when
replaced with jack bean, and as of 1999, replaced by
brachiaria; (6) L+GY+SA/B: Liming + gypsum + black
velvet bean until 1999, then replaced by brachiaria;
(7) L+GY+CC/CE/B: Liming +gypsum+pigeonpea
until 1994, when replaced by jack bean, and as of
1999, replaced by brachiaria, and two controls as
reference; (8) NV: Native Cerrado vegetation and (9)
BS: Bare soil (no tilling and no planting) (Table 1).

The controls bare soil and native Cerrado were
included for comparison among treatments, so as to
monitor the recovery of the studied physical

RECOVERY OF SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BY GREEN MANURE, LIMING, GYPSUM...               1401

characteristics as well as the evolution of the surface
horizon.  An approach of the physical properties of
the exposed soil to those of soil under natural vegetation
would mean the restoration of the degraded soil
(anthropogenic intervention would be accelerating the
recovery process).  Differences observed in the recovery
treatments compared to the control bare soil would
indicate beneficial changes in the soil properties.
These changes would be interpreted in comparison
with the soil conditions under natural vegetation.

In January 2008, the following soil physical
properties were assessed: soil bulk density, by the
volumetric ring method; total porosity, by measuring
soil saturation (total volume of water-filled soil pores);
microporosity was assessed using the tension table
and a water column of 6 kPa; and macroporosity was
calculated from the difference between total porosity
and microporosity.  All evaluations were performed
according to methodologies described by Embrapa
(1997).  The distribution and aggregate stability in water
in this study is represented by the mean weighted
diameter (MWD), according to Angers &amp;amp; Mehuys
methodology (2000).  Soil Penetration Resistance was
determined by a Penetrographer PAT SC-60 and soil
moisture on a mass basis (Embrapa, 1997).

For the analysis, according to their specific
characteristics, disturbed and non-disturbed soil
samples were collected from three layers: 0.00–0.10;
0.10–0.20, and 0.20–0.40 m.  Soil Penetration
Resistance as well as soil gravimetric moisture were
assessed in the layers 0.00–0.15 and 0.15–0.30.

Dry matter mass was evaluated every three
months.  Plants from two points (contained in 1 m2)
per plot were collected and weighed (drying at 60–
70 oC to constant weight) and expressed in kg ha-1.
The stem diameter and height of tree species of
spontaneous occurrence in the experimental area were
assessed.

Results of soil physical evaluations were analyzed
by variance analysis and Tukey test at 5 % for mean
comparison.  Sisvar software (Ferreira, 2003) was used
for the statistical analysis.  It is emphasized that, for
stem diameter and height of the spontaneous tree
species, no statistical analysis was performed due to the
variations in numbers of plants per plot (statistically
not controlled because occurrence was spontaneous).
Therefore, the plants were only characterized.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 2 shows the significant difference among
treatments in soil macroporosity, microporosity and
bulk density as well as the MWD in all layers.  For
total porosity, significant differences were observed
in all layers but 0.10–0.20.

For macroporosity in the bare soil (degraded, no
recovery measures) values were observed below the
limit considered critical for a good development of the
plant root system, i.e., 0.10 m3 m-3 (Baver, 1949;
Greenland, 1981; Gupta &amp;amp; Allmaras, 1987), in the

three soil layers studied.  It is noteworthy that in
layer 0.00–0.10 m, three treatments approached the
critical limit (SA/B; CC/CE/B; L+GY/SA/B), while five
exceeded it (OT/B; L+SA/B; L+GY/CE/B; NV),
although there were no statistical differences among
them.  In terms of soil quality, this means that the
physical conditions in treatments in which
macroporosity exceeded the limit are better for a good
development of the root system.  Under natural
Cerrado vegetation, macroporosity was higher in the
three soil layers and statistically different from the
other treatments.

The reduction in macroporosity in degraded soils
results from increased compaction, as evidenced in
the higher bulk density (Araújo et al., 2004; Camilotti
et al., 2005).  A similar behavior was observed by
Campos &amp;amp; Alves (2006) and Kitamura et al. (2008),
in agreement with the observations in this study
(Table 2).

In the layers 0.10–0.20 and 0.20–0.40, macroporosity
was similar in the soils under treatment and the bare
soil (degraded), indicating that the treatments had no
effect below 0.10 m.  Effects in deeper layers take longer
because the response to recovery of physical properties
of Cerrado soils is slow (Alves &amp;amp; Suzuki, 2004).

The physical properties of soils used as quality
indicators show that the surface layer is being
recovered (Table 2): macroporosity was higher and/or
similar to the critical value; for soil with average
texture, the values of bulk density were within the
average bulk density range for this textural class
(1.40–1.50 kg dm-3).  It is noted that the texture of
the exposed soil (under study in this work) is sandy-
clay loam soil (258, 79 and 663 g kg-1 of clay, silt and
sand, respectively) (Campos &amp;amp; Alves, 2006; Kitamura
et al., 2008).

A comparison of means of physical properties taken
as indicators of soil quality among the recovery
treatments (Table 2) showed a similar behavior in the
studied soil layers.  These findings corroborate results
of Alves et al. (2007) in an area degraded by a power
plant construction.

The data of total soil porosity and bulk density in
the layer 0.00–0.10 m (Table 2) confirm the soil
recovery in this layer.  Total porosity was similar
among the treatments used for soil restoration, but
was greater than and statistically different from the
bare soil (degraded).  On the other hand, except for
the treatment with L+GY+SA/B, results were similar
in soil with natural Cerrado vegetation, indicating
improvements in the soil structure.  For soil bulk
density, though, values were similar among the
recovery treatments, lower than in the bare soil, and
higher than under natural Cerrado vegetation.

In general there are similarities among the soil
recovery treatments influencing the layer 0.00–
0.10 m, corroborating results of Campos &amp;amp; Alves
(2006); Alves et al. (2007) and Kitamura et al. (2008).

It is worth highlighting the action of treatment lime+
black velvet bean/brachiaria, in 0.00–0.10 m, with
similar results to the soil under natural Cerrado
vegetation.  This means that the treatment is efficient
in soil recovery, since the conditions are similar to
those of a soil with natural vegetation.  These results
confirm findings of Alves (2001) and Alves et al. (2007).

In the surface layers (0.10–0.20 and 0.20–0.40 m)
data obtained in this study (Table 2) compared with
data obtained in the same area by Andrade Júnior
(2004) and Alves &amp;amp; Souza (2008) show improvements
in the soil physical quality, i.e, a restructuration of
the soil occurred, reflected in the decrease of bulk
density and increase of macroporosity and total
porosity.  Despite these improvements, it was noted
that the physical properties were still degraded
(smaller macroporosity, greater bulk density, less total
porosity, compared to the critical limits and natural
soil conditions).  Reichert et al. (2003) stated that the
evaluation of soil quality has both spatial and temporal
dimensions.  Intervals between measurements, to
observe changes in the indicator assessed, depend on
the period required for an action to produce quantifiable
changes, and its frequency in space must take the
spatial variations caused by the soil into account.
Andrade Júnior (2004) mentions that, as time passes,
brachiaria roots supply organic matter to the soil while
the addition of organic matter by green manures and
the brachiaria root system have a positive effect on
the physical soil properties.

For soil penetration resistance in the layer 0.00–
0.10 m, values were highest (4.9 MPa) for the bare
soil (Table 3).  There was no difference between the
soil with natural Cerrado vegetation and the recovery
treatments, and values varied from 2.2 to 3.7 MPa.
Many are the studies focused on the search for a
critical value or a range of critical values of soil
penetration resistance limiting plant growth, but
uncertainties still remain about these limits, due to
the diversity of behaviors of plants and soils (Reichert
et al., 2007).  It is known that the soil penetration
resistance increases with soil degradation and
compaction; limiting values to root growth vary from
1.5 to 3.0 MPa (Grant &amp;amp; Lanfond, 1993), from 2.0 to
4.0 MPa (Arshad et al., 1996), and in nop-tillage
systems they reach 5.0 MPa (Ehlers et al., 1983).  The
recovery treatments show that the soil is being
restored, since the soil penetration resistance showed
that the soil was less compacted in the treatment areas
than in the bare soil.

The determination of soil moisture at the moment
of evaluation of soil penetration resistance is
fundamental for a proper interpretation of the results.
The moisture degree influences the evaluation by
modifying cohesion among soil particles, which is
greater in dry soils and decreases as the water content
increases, causing particle detachment (Klein et al.,
1998).  Soil moisture was similar among treatments
(Table 3).  It is worth emphasizing the value of soil

resistance under natural Cerrado vegetation
(3.0 MPa), which was deemed high This was probably
due to the low water content in the soil, since Campos
(2006), for the soil in study (Red Latosol sandy-clay
loam texture under natural Cerrado vegetation)
observed that at this moisture level, the tension value
in soil water was 200 kPa.  Nevertheless, what is
relevant is that the water content was similar among
the treatments.

In the layer 0.15–0.30 m (Table 3), soil penetration
resistance under Cerrado vegetation and in the
recovery treatments with SA/B, L+GY+SA/B and
L+GY+G/CE/B was lower than in the bare (degraded)
soil.  But among the soil recovery treatments no
difference was noted.  This behavior is consistent with
observations for soil porosity and bulk density, i..e,
the treatments were more efficient in the soil surface
layer.

For brachiaria dry matter production (Table 4),
significance was noted for treatment and time, while
the interaction of treatment x time was not significant.
When comparing all soil recovery treatments, the
treatments L+GY+CC/CE/B and L+GY+SA/B
produced the most and the least amount of brachiaria
dry matter, respectively.  But among the other
treatments there was no difference.  It was expected
that the treatment with lime and gypsum would be
the most efficient in brachiaria dry matter production,
which was not confirmed.  Among the green manures,
the performance of black velvet bean was better than
of jack bean in terms of residual effects, reflected in
the growth of brachiaria.  In contrast, Andrade Júnior
(2004), working in the same area, reported greater
brachiaria dry matter production by the treatment
L+GY+CC/CE, in disagreement with the results
presented here.  Brachiaria dry matter was equal to
or higher than observed by Kawatoko (1999), who
reported results between 1,818 to 2439 kg ha-1 in Red

Latosol.  This shows that this soil is in recovery
process, since the values here found are equivalent to
those in soil under natural conditions.

The occurrence of spontaneous tree species in the
area was assessed in October 2007 and showed the
presence of three species: Machaerium acutifolium
Vogel, Solanum lycocarpum St.  Hil and Mimosa
lacticifera Rizini and Mattos Filho (Table 5).  A total

of 88 plants were identified of which 85 were M.
acutifolium species, two S.  lycocarpum, and one M.
lacticifera.  In 2009, the S.  lycocarpum plants were
no longer observed in the area, while three more M.
acutifoliumt plants had grown, and one new plant of
the species Curatella Americana L, of the family
Dilleniaceae had appeared.  The dynamics of the
occurrence of these species in the study area was most
likely related to their adaptation to the adverse soil
conditions (degraded structure).

It can be noted that, of the three species which
regrew naturally in the study area, one belonged to the
family Fabaceae (M. lactifera).  The Fabaceae are
considered essential for the success of regeneration of a
degraded area in view of their rusticity and high ability
to provide the soil with organic matter (Costa, 2007).

When analyzing the development of the species
Machaerium acutifolium Vogel, the species with the
largest number, it was observed that this was the
species with the greatest growth (height and diameter)
in treatment L+GY+CC/CE/B, followed by treatments
SA/B, CC/CE/B and L+GY+SA/B (Table 5).  Ferreira
et al. (2007), when evaluating the development of tree
species in an area degraded by the construction of a
power plant, found that, of all species analyzed
(Piptadenia gonoacantha, Inga affinis, Clitoria
fairchildiana, Machaerium villosum, Anadenanthera
colubrine, Acacia mangium, Cecropia pachystachya,
Trema micrantha, Erythrina falcate and Acacia
auriculiformis) the tallest species with the largest
average diameters belonged to the family Fabaceae,
reinforcing the thesis that the species of this family
are fundamental for the recovery of degraded areas,
because they grow fast in adverse environments.  It
is important to enhance their occurrence from the
Amazon region across to São Paulo and Mato Grosso

do Sul.  The spontaneous incidence of this species in
the recovering area, with the greatest number and
development, show evidence of the efficiency of the
treatments for soil recovery.

Some authors associate the competition of
brachiaria with the development of other species.  For
Durigan et al. (1998), grasses (Poaceae) compete with
the Cerrado species, slowing down, or even preventing
the process of natural regeneration.  Reis &amp;amp; Kageyama
(2003) however highlight that grasses in general
produce substances capable of preventing the growth
of other species by means of a process called antibiosis.
On the other hand, this does not mean that they
should be avoided in restoration processes in view of
their capacity of colonization, of organic matter
production and improvement in soil quality.  Results
of this study confirm information of Seitz (1994), who
stated that anemochoric species tend to be the first to
take root after total vegetation destruction.

As an anemochoric species, these plants may have
been brought to the experimental area by wind
dispersal of seeds from an adult plant.  This is evidence
of the importance of dispersal in the recovery processes
of degraded areas.  It can therefore be said that, for
the species Machaerium acutifolium, the variable
number of plants was influenced by the proximity of
the matrix plant in relation to the experimental plots,
once the highest number of plants of this species was
found in the plots closest to the adult plant.  Stem
diameter and height of the plants were influenced by
the treatments since the greatest average diameters
were found in the plots treated with the combination
of chemical fertilizers and green manure, particularly
L+GY+CC/CE/B.  This reiterates the fact that the
treatments are improving the characteristics of the
recovering soil (Alves &amp;amp; Souza, 2008), resulting in
plant with better development in the fertilized plots.

It was observed that the species Machaerium
acutifolium is not competitive since other plants were
found around the matrix plant, and it can be stated
that it provides conditions for the development of other
species.  No other plant of the same species was found
near the matrix plant, making it evident that the
experimental area (recovering environment) created
beneficial conditions for the establishment of species,
once the area under study had been recovering for 17
years, resulting in better conditions in relation to the
ones found outside the experiment.  In Table 5 the
treatments with most plants can be observed, which
means that the plots of those treatments were nearer
the matrix plant.  Spontaneous occurrence seemed to
be more related to this proximity than to the treatments.

CONCLUSIONS

1. The soil physical proprieties are being recovered
and soil macroporosity, total porosity and bulk density
were good indicators of the soil quality.

RECOVERY OF SOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BY GREEN MANURE, LIMING, GYPSUM...               1405

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1397-1406, 2011

2. Spontaneous occurrence of native species, of
which Machaerium acutifolium Vogel was the most
adapted, were an index of the process of soil recovery.

3. Dry matter production of Brachiaria decumbens
on recovering soil and on soil under natural conditions
was similar.

4. The use of green manure associated to lime and
gypsum for seven years, followed by Brachiaria
decumbens for 10 years, plus the spontaneous
occurrence of native species in action for three years
were efficient to restore the soil in this study.
