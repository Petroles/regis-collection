acknowledgements My first acknowledgments go to Professor Jesu?s Dubert, for giving me
this opportunity without questioning if I could see it through and for
never losing his humanity, which makes him the most thoughtful person
I have worked with, and to Doctor Rita Nolasco, tireless researcher, on-
duty technician, thoroughly perfectionist, multitasker to a higher level,
motherly figure and wonderful friend. These acknowledgements extend
to Professor Alfredo Rocha, for his input and important contributions
to this work.
I would also like to thank my working colleagues, without whom it
would all have been much more difficult. To Rosa, for her generosity,
inspiring resilience and constant good humor, always reminding me
that a street cannot be swept in one day. To Magda, with whom I
have walked many a long and winding road and who is an admirable
fighter. To Fab??ola and Nayara, friends from beyond the seas who have
come to cheer up and improve Aveiro’s social and cultural programs,
and also Daniel and Ana Sousa. To Nuno, my ride to halfway home
and companion of endless meetings, for his availability and un-funny
jokes. To Ana Picado, Sandra, Joa?o, Ana Cristina, Carlos, Susana and
Tiago, for their high spirits. And finally to Teresa, for having received
me in her home.
These years in Aveiro would have been lonelier and sadder if not for the
presence, even at a distance, of Raquel, my soul sister, Rita, my Ohana,
Sofia, on the other side of the world, Ana Bento, on Her Majesty’s land,
Irene, in Alentejo, and my intrepid adventure companions: Ricardo,
Toma?s, Pedro, Daniela, Ivo, Hugo, Filipa, little Magui, Jorge, Carina,
and lately Catarina and Rita. A thank you also to Ana Machado and
Ana Aguiar for the conversations and lunch picnics outside IO.
This journey would not have been the same without my wonderful stay
in Brest and if I had not met the extraordinary Francesca, Nico, Rui,
Xavier, Dhouha, Lu??s, Emanuella, Simone, Pierre, Guillaume, Camille,
and all those who have received me arms wide open at LPO/UBO,
especially Bernard Le Cann and Bruno Blanke.
To my parents, I leave a thank you from the bottom of my heart, for
all the help they have given me throughout these long and sometimes
painful years, and for urging me to always be the best I can be. To
my family, particularly to A?ngela and Andreia, for having given me
the happiest and most beautiful wedding I could have wished for, and
to the family I was adopted into, especially Ze? and Sofia, for their
strength, courage and generosity.
Last but not least, to Alexandre, my safe haven, my companion of
hundreds of journeys, both geographical and emotional, and now my
husband. Let this be just the beginning of our story!

Resumo O objectivo deste trabalho e? realizar um estudo abrangente da cir-
culac?a?o na Margem Ibe?rica Ocidental (WIM) atrave?s da modelac?a?o
nume?rica, e postular sobre como essa circulac?a?o sera? no futuro. A
abordagem adoptada foi o desenvolvimento de uma configurac?a?o re-
gional de alta resoluc?a?o num modelo ocea?nico, capaz de reproduzir a
dina?mica de larga e pequena escala na zona de transic?a?o costeira.
Quatro experie?ncias nume?ricas foram efectuadas para este efeito: (1)
uma corrida climatolo?gica, a fim de estudar o comportamento sazonal
do sistema e caracterizar o estado me?dio; (2) uma corrida forc?ada com
ventos e fluxos reais para o per??odo de 2001-2011, a fim de estudar a
variabilidade inter-anual do sistema; (3) uma corrida forc?ada com cam-
pos me?dios de modelos clima?ticos globais (GCMs) para o presente,
a fim de validar GCMs como forc?amento adequado para modelac?a?o
ocea?nica regional; (4) semelhante a? corrida (3) para o per??odo 2071-
2100, a fim de avaliar poss??veis conseque?ncias de um cena?rio clima?tico
futuro na hidrografia e dina?mica da WIM. Para ale?m disso, foram real-
izados dois estudos com part??culas Lagrangianas: um a fim de trac?ar a
origem das a?guas afloradas ao longo da WIM; outro a fim de retratar
os padro?es de dispersa?o, acumulac?a?o e conectividade larval.
Constatou-se que a configurac?a?o nume?rica e? adequada para a re-
produc?a?o do estado me?dio do sistema, caracterizac?a?o sazonal e estudo
da variabilidade inter-anual. Concluiu-se que ha? prevale?ncia de escoa-
mento para o po?lo junto a? vertente, fluxo este que co-existe com o jacto
de afloramento no Vera?o, embora haja evide?ncia do seu desvio para o
largo, e que esta? associado ao escoamento da A?gua Mediterra?nica nos
n??veis inferiores, sugerindo um cara?cter barotro?pico. Da aplicac?a?o de
um futuro cena?rio clima?tico retiraram-se as seguintes concluso?es: ha?
um aquecimento e um decre?scimo de salinidade generalizados nos n??veis
superiores; a tende?ncia para o escoamento para o po?lo mante?m-se, e
apesar da intensificac?a?o dos ventos favora?veis ao afloramento no Vera?o
a respectiva banda costeira esta? mais restringida em largura e profun-
didade. No que diz respeito a? conectividade e dispersa?o larval ao longo
da WIM, observou-se que a migrac?a?o vertical diurna aumenta o recru-
tamento em todo o dom??nio, e enquanto que as linhas de costa mais
suaves sa?o melhores fornecedores, ha? maior acumulac?a?o em zonas de
topografia mais recortada.

Abstract The purpose of this work is to carry out a comprehensive study on
the Western Iberian Margin (WIM) circulation my means of numerical
modeling, and to postulate what this circulation will be in the future.
The adopted approach was the development of a regional ocean model
configuration with high resolution, capable of reproducing the large-
and small-scale dynamics of the coastal transition zone.
Four numerical experiences were carried out according to these objec-
tives: (1) a climatological run, in order to study the system’s seasonal
behavior and its mean state; (2) a run forced with real winds and fluxes
for period 2001-2011 in order to study the interannual variability of the
system; (3) a run forced with mean fields from Global Climate Models
(GCMs) for the present, in order to validate GCMs as adequate forcing
for regional ocean modeling; (4) a similar run (3) for period 2071-2100,
in order to assess possible consequences of a future climate scenario
on the hydrography and dynamics of the WIM. Furthermore, two La-
grangian particle studies were carried out: one in order to trace the
origin of the upwelled waters along the WIM; the other in order to
portrait the patterns of larval dispersal, accumulation and connectivity.
The numerical configuration proved to be adequate in the reproduction
of the system’s mean state, seasonal characterization and an interan-
nual variability study. There is prevalence of poleward flow at the
slope, which coexists with the upwelling jet during summer, although
there is evidence of its shifting offshore, and which is associated with
the Mediterranean Water flow at deeper levels, suggesting a barotropic
character. From the future climate scenario essay, the following con-
clusions were drawn: there is general warming and freshening of upper
level waters; there is still poleward tendency, and despite the upwelling-
favorable winds strengthening in summer the respective coastal band
becomes more restricted in width and depth. In what concerns larval
connectivity and dispersion along the WIM, diel vertical migration was
observed to increase recruitment throughout the domain, and while
smooth coastlines are better suppliers, there is higher accumulation
where the topography is rougher.

Introduction

1.1 Overview, Motivation and Objectives

Portugal is often called “the little corner planted by the sea” by its natives because,
with a shape strongly resembling a rectangle, two of its four sides are bathed by ocean. For
a small country (roughly 92,000 km2), it possesses almost 1,000 km of coast (islands not
included). Therefore, the sea has always played a major role throughout its history, since
before the Discovery travels in the 15th and 16th centuries. Furthermore, the ocean has
always provided numerous resources, and was once the sole means of income for the major-
ity of the port towns along the Portuguese coast. Portugal’s location, besides bestowing it
with the most tender of climates, is most fortunate for fisheries, since it corresponds to an
ocean eastern boundary and therefore favorable for the occurrence of coastal upwelling, a
phenomenon that strongly stimulates primary productivity. Fisheries are still an important
trade nowadays.

Moreover, it is well known that the ocean is a key factor of the climate system; it
absorbs large quantities of heat in the tropics and re-distributes it throughout the planet
by means of the large-scale ocean currents that compose the thermohaline circulation (e.g.
Pond and Pickard, 1983). The ocean is also a very efficient CO2 sink, which has been
of the utmost importance given the alarming increase of this greenhouse gas emission in
the last decades, and the consequent increase in global temperatures (e.g. Hansen et al.,
2010). How much heat and CO2 can the ocean absorb, and how have these quantities
changed in the past decades, have been questions addressed by many environmental works
(e.g. Levitus et al., 2001; Levitus et al., 2012). The warming of the world’s oceans has
also been increasingly documented in recent years (e.g. Levitus et al., 2000, 2005; Casey
and Cornillon, 2001; Domingues et al., 2008; among others).

These considerations are also true for the coastal ocean. Coastal thermohaline char-
acteristics define the marine species that inhabit these waters and their life cycle and mi-
gration patterns, whereas the regional hydrography defines the regional dynamics and the
way these properties are transported. In the case of Portugal, for a country so dependent
on maritime resources for its economy, whether directly related like fisheries or indirectly

related like tourism, understanding the dynamics of the coastal ocean and studying present
and future changes at different space and time scales becomes relevant.

The aim of this work was to carry out, by means of numerical modeling, a compre-
hensive study of the Western Iberian coastal ocean circulation at the upper levels. First,
a thorough description of its seasonality and mean hydrography and dynamics was per-
formed, including an essay on the origin of upwelled waters in summer. Second, a study
focusing on the system’s interannual variability followed, based on an 11-year simulation
and the analysis of temperature anomalies, salinity, and meridional transport. By the
application of a climate change future scenario to our ocean model, the consequences at
the ocean’s upper layers were evaluated in terms of mean thermohaline distribution and
dynamics. Finally, a Lagrangian module was applied in order to address larval distribution
and behavior in this region. The region and sub-regions are described in section 1.3. The
regional modeling configurations are described in section 1.4, and all the respective runs
are summarized in section 1.5.

1.2 The Eastern North Atlantic Ocean

The North Atlantic (Figure 1.1, after Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003) is dominated at
mid-latitudes by the typical Subtropical Gyre, which is composed by the Gulf Stream,
flowing northeastward along the eastern North America coast that in turn bifurcates at
about 40oN, 45oW into two other large-scale currents: the North Atlantic Current, which
flows northward/northeastward into the Arctic Ocean, and the Azores Current (AzC),
which consists in the northern limit of the gyre. Within the gyre at the bottom of the
ocean lies the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), a strong bathymetric feature that splits the
North Atlantic into approximately two halves (an eastern and a western one), and reaches
in average 2000 m but can rise to less than 1000 m (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). The
AzC crosses the MAR at about 35oN, 45oW, after which it flows eastward in a mostly
zonal pathway along ? 34oN. In the proximity of the European southwestern coast, it
veers southward, partly recirculating in the Gulf of Cadiz (Peliz et al., 2007) and partly
joining the Canary Current along the northwestern African coast (Barton et al., 1998).
The loop of the gyre closes with the westward-flowing North Equatorial Current that links
to the Gulf Stream by means of the Central America eastern coast complex current system
(Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). The eastern boundary current system is concluded with
the weak large-scale current that flows mostly southward along the Iberian Peninsula,
frequently named the Portugal Current, with typical velocities of a few centimeters per
second (Saunders, 1982).

The Eastern North Atlantic is one of the world’s main eastern boundary current sys-
tems, also called Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. Eastern boundaries have in com-
mon the fact that, in summer, atmospheric high-pressure systems relocate to the mid-
latitudes and in the proximity of the western coasts. In particular for the Eastern North
Atlantic, the wind regime is dictated by the relative location of the anticyclonic system of
the Azores High and the cyclonic system of the Iceland Low. The position of the Azores

High oscillates between northern locations off the Iberian Peninsula during summer and a
southern position during winter in front of Morocco, while the Iceland low intensifies leaving
room to the eastward passage of low pressure systems, that introduce a strong variability
in the circulation at the Iberian Peninsula during wintertime. These atmospheric regimes
are the reason why in late spring and summer there is coastal upwelling. Its dynamics will
be further discussed in section 1.3.1.

The eastern North Atlantic upwelling system differs from the others in that it is in-
terrupted in the Strait of Gibraltar, being divided in a northern upwelling region — the
western coast of the Iberian Peninsula — and a southern one in the region of the Canary
Current. That is why this system is also called the Canary Upwelling System (Barton et
al., 1998). The Strait of Gibraltar divides the Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea,
enclosed between Europe and Africa. This gap between the two continents gives rise to the
other most important dynamical feature of this region: the Mediterranean Water outflow
into the Atlantic, further detailed in section 1.3.2.

This is thus the environment of the small region under scope that is the coastal tran-
sition zone off the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula, henceforth called the Western
Iberian Margin (WIM), described below. The main rivers and topographic features are
shown in Figure 1.2 b.

1.3 The Western Iberian Margin (WIM)

1.3.1 Shelf/Slope Circulation

a. Coastal Upwelling
The summer mid-latitude high pressure systems described in the previous section pro-

duce equatorward winds (northerly in the northern hemisphere, southerly in the southern
hemisphere) along the coast, which results in an offshore displacement of surface warm
waters and rising of deep, cool, nutrient-rich waters to replace them (e.g. Wooster et al.,
1976). When the wind blows, a current is created at the ocean surface with a direction
45o to the right of the wind direction (northern hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect.
The action of wind stress is felt in the water column down to the basis of the so-called
Ekman layer, which has typical several tens of meters (&lt;100 m). In this layer, successive
water levels undergo the same effect as the surface, that is, deflection of velocity to the
right, while the velocity’s module weakens in depth. The result is a spiral with a net water
transport perpendicular to wind stress — the Ekman transport, which can be computed
as follows:

?QEK =
?? × ?k
f

(1.1)

where ?? is the wind stress, ?k is the unitary vector perpendicular to ?? and f = 2? sin ?
is the Coriolis parameter (? is the rotational velocity of the Earth and ? the latitude).

The Ekman transport causes divergence at the upper layers (lowering of the sea surface
at the coastal boundary). This in turn causes convergence in the lower layers, inducing
onshore motion. These waters then rise when approaching the coast and replace the ones
advected offshore.

These upwelled waters are then advected equatorward because a coastal jet is created
due to the rising of the isotherms and the geostrophic balance that is created between the
consequent pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. This alongshore jet has its maximum
speed at mid-shelf, weakening seaward and also toward the coast due to friction.

Another mechanism that generates vertical upward velocities is the Ekman pumping,
which occurs due to wind stress curl near the coast. This curl exists because, when ap-
proaching land, wind stress decreases due to friction. Vertical velocities due to Ekman
pumping are computed as follows:

Lower level waters are rich in nutrients and thus promote phytoplankton blooms when
reaching the surface, which in turn are the crucial factor for primary productivity (Relvas
et al., 2007). This is why upwelling systems are some of the most productive regions of
the world’s ocean.

b. Poleward Flow
Besides the upwelling circulation during late spring and summer, the large-scale temper-

ature and salinity meridional gradients (Peliz et al., 2003b), which dictate the thermohaline
structure of the water masses, together with wind forcing, promote a system of poleward
currents along the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula observed mainly during autumn and winter,
as described in the classic references of Frouin et al. (1990) and Haynes and Barton (1990)
for the western Iberian Peninsula, and continuing along the Bay of Biscay as described by
Pingree and Le Cann (1990). This northward circulation is typical of mid-latitude eastern
continental margins (Neshyba, 1986). A consensual denomination for this poleward flow is
the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC). The classic view of the IPC presents it as an upper-
slope baroclinic current, associated with the downwelling of the isopycnal field in a width
of about 40 km, and positive temperature and salinity anomalies from the surface down to
typically 400 m. It was suggested that poleward flows are not a winter phenomenon only,
but are present throughout the year (Peliz et al, 2005; Relvas et al., 2007).

There is another factor at play in the WIM shelf circulation that originates from fresh-
water input from the many rivers along the coast (see Figure 1.2 b), which consists in
recurrent lenses of low salinity water in the upper 10-20 m close to the coast, that can
be advected offshore. Peliz et al. (2002) have named it Western Iberian Bouyant Plume
(WIBP) and determined its maximum salinity in 35.7. The WIBP is more evident and
frequently wider in winter due to the stronger river discharge in that season. The IPC
sometimes works as a barrier for the offshore displacement of the WIBP (Santos et al.,

6



2004). In summer and in the presence of coastal upwelling, the WIBP is advected both
equatorward and offshore through the Ekman layer (Peliz et al., 2002).

1.3.2 Mediterranean Water Outflow

Upon exiting the 300-m deep Strait of Gibraltar, the dense Mediterranean Water
(MW) flows downslope within the Gulf of Cadiz until it reaches neutral buoyancy. The
intermediate-level resulting current is denoted Mediterranean Undercurrent in the Gulf of
Cadiz (Ambar and Howe, 1979a) and Mediterranean Water Vein along the Western Iberian
Peninsula (Daniault et al., 1994). Here, it flows at mid-depths often in two cores, typically
at 800 m (the upper core), where a temperature maximum is reached, and at 1200 m
(the lower core), the depth at which the salinity maximum is found. The signature of the
hydrographic properties of both cores attenuates (specially the upper core) poleward along
the Western Iberian Peninsula. Associated with this flow, there are mesoscale structures
that are formed and which are responsible for a relevant part of this water mass properties
transport: the Mediterranean eddies (Meddies), anticyclonic vortices with radii of several
tens of kilometers, occurring typically between 700 m and 1300 m deep (Bower et al.,
1995). Meddies propagate typically southwestward into the North Atlantic (Richardson et
al., 2000). MW is further discussed in the following sub-section.

1.3.3 Water Masses

Figure 1.3 shows a typical ?-S diagram for WIM, adapted from Fiu?za et al. (1998). The
least dense waters correspond to near-surface waters (?? &amp;lt;26.6), reflecting their strong
seasonal variability. These waters have temperatures varying between 14oC and more than
20oC. Salinities lower than 35.7 in the surface water density range are the signature of the
WIBP.

The upper limit of the central waters is identified by a salinity maximum found in the
interval 26.5 &amp;lt;?? &amp;lt;27, with values varying between 36.0 and 36.2. According to R??os et al.
(1992), two types of central waters can be identified off Western Iberian Peninsula: Eastern
North Atlantic Central Water of subpolar origin (ENACWsp) and Eastern North Atlantic
Central Water of subtropical origin (ENACWst). ENACWsp is related with Subpolar
Mode Water, which forms due to deep convection that occurs during winter north of 46oN
(McCartney and Talley, 1982). The ENACWst, formed to the north of the Azores Current
at approximately 35oN, is advected northwestward.

The basis of the ENACWsp is characterized by a salinity minimum (? 35.6 at the WIM)
and marks the transition toward the Mediterranean Water (MW). The MW flows through
the Gulf of Cadiz and the entire basin with a typical tongue structure, reaching the Bay
of Biscay as described in the literature and as observed in many available climatologies
(Reynaud et al., 1998; Iorga and Lozier, 1999; Troupin et al., 2010). Two cores can be
distinguished: a less dense (?? ? 27.5-27.6) upper core (MWU), with typical values found
along the WIM of ? = 11-12oC and S = 36.1-36.2; and a denser (?? ? 27.8) lower core

7



(MWL), with a lower temperature (?&lt;11
oC) and a higher salinity (S = 36.3-36.4) (Ambar

and Howe, 1979b).
The deeper waters (below MW) are not within the scope of this work, but they influence

the intermediate levels and hence a brief description follows. The two most important are
the Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The LSW is
characterized by very low salinities (? 34.9) and ? = 3.50oC. These values were measured
near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at about 50oN (Talley and McCartney, 1982). The NADW
has higher salinities and lower temperatures than the LSW, and was defined by Saunders
(1982) as ? = 2.50oC and S = 34.94.

al., 1998). ? and S values correspond to a climatological dataset described in Fiu?za et al.
(1998) for the 6 regions showed in the map in the lower right corner of the Figure.

1.4 Regional Modeling

1.4.1 Overview

The numerical study of the circulation of the WIM is a challenge for modelers, for
several reasons: i) the presence of a narrow shelf and a steep slope, as well as the presence
of numerous canyons and promontories, requiring high resolution to properly resolve the
shelf/slope circulation; ii) the presence of a unique oceanographic feature, which is the
Mediterranean outflow, generated at the Strait of Gibraltar and spreading into the north-
eastern Atlantic giving rise to the large scale MW anomaly; iii) the strong influence of the
open ocean circulation (the Azores Current system and meridional pressure gradients) on
the coastal transition zone, that forces the circulation in this region.

Eastern boundary currents, due to their complexity and to the importance in studying
the upwelling phenomenon, have been the subject of several regional modeling studies over
the past years. The following works are important efforts toward a better knowledge of the
dynamics of these systems: Marchesiello et al. (2003), concerning the California Current
System; Penven et al. (2005), who focused on the Peru Current System; Veitch et al.
(2010), with respect to the Benguela Current System; and Mason et al. (2011) for the
Canary Current System.

In what concerns numerical modeling regional studies at the full scale of the region,
some previous works contributed to the study of this particular circulation. Some of them
were carried out at a resolution of about 9 km (Stevens et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2002) and
focused on spring and winter circulation; others were idealized studies at a high resolution
(Røed and Shi, 1999; Peliz et al., 2003a). Batteen et al. (2000, 2007) carried out sensitivity
studies in order to assess the different mechanisms controlling the circulation in the region.
The study by Serra et al. (2010) resolves the circulation in this region with realistic forcing
and very high resolution, focusing on the study of the influence of the MW vein on the
surface circulation, with emphasis on the mesoscale phenomena. On the other hand, from
the point of view of operational oceanography of the Western Iberian Margin, Mateus et
al (2012) focused on the application of an operational configuration (? 1/16o resolution)
to discuss its potential for products and services for scientific and coastal management
activities. In the neighborhood of the region, and also at a high resolution, Friocourt et al.
(2007) and Peliz et al. (2007) studied the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Cadiz circulation,
respectively.

In this light, the purpose of this work is to carry out a comprehensive study of the entire
region, where all the factors that dictate its dynamics are taken into account, including
river discharge and the Mediterranean Water flow, all combined to address different aspects
of the current system.

1.4.2 The Model (Regional Ocean Modelling System — ROMS)

ROMS is a free-surface, terrain following coordinate model, designed to resolve regional
problems (Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2003, 2005). ROMS solves the incompressible

9



primitive equations based on the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations, and is cou-
pled with advection/diffusion schemes for potential temperature and salinity as well as a
nonlinear equation of state.

A brief account of the main equations, approximations and parameterizations follows.

The equation of state (? is the sea water density) depends on temperature (T), salinity
(S) and pressure (p):

? = ? (T, S, p) (1.3)

The primitive equations of the ocean state obey the laws of conservation of properties,
such as mass (equation of continuity):

d?

dt
+ ??.?u = 0 (1.4)

where ?u = u ?ex + v ?ey + w ?ez and, through the principle of fluid incompressibility
(d?/dt = 0), gives:

?.?u = 0 (1.5)

The conservation of momentum (the equation of motion), based on Netwon’s 2nd law
of motion (?F = m ?a) is:

d?u

dt
= ?

?p
?

? 2?? × ?u + ?g + ?F + ?D (1.6)

where on the right hand of the equation are (from left to right) the pressure gradi-
ent force, the Coriolis force, gravity, friction and dissipation. Likewise, the equations of
conservation of heat and salt are, respectively:

dT

dt
= ?FT + ?DS and

dS

dt
= ?FS + ?DS (1.7)

The vertical component is obtained through the hydrostatic approximation, which con-
siders that w and ?w/?t are very small in comparison with the horizontal velocities and
their variation in time. Thus, gravity balances the vertical pressure gradient.

The equations of motion also assume the Boussinesq approximation for geostrophic
currents (that is, when the Coriolis force balances the horizontal pressure gradient), which
states that horizontal variations of density are negligible except in the buoyancy term.
Hence, the previous conservation equations can be expressed as:

ponents (parameterized); QT is the surface heat flux; Cp is the heat capacity of the ocean;

ROMS coordinates are topography-following (or ? coordinates), which means that there
are the same number of levels near the coast than at locations with higher depths. Taking
this into account, a stretching factor is applied to the surface (?s) and to the bottom (?b),
in order to define where to attribute the best resolution (surface or bottom). If ?s is large,
then ? levels are more concentrated in the surface, providing it a finer resolution; if ?b = 1
(0 &amp;lt;?b &amp;lt;1), then it is the bottom that is enhanced.

During the equations discretization process, which is carried out on an Arakawa C grid
(meaning that u and v are defined on the grid lines and all other variables inside each
grid cell), it is necessary to add a bathymetry correction for the slope, as to smooth the
transition toward shallower depths. This criterion of stability is defined as:

r =
?h

2h
(1.11)

where ?h is the depth difference between neighbor cells, h is the local depth.
The advection scheme is based on the work done by Marchesiello et al. (2009), in order

to reduce spurious diapycnal mixing in ?-coordinate models characteristic of higher-order
diffusive advection schemes. This scheme involves the split of advection and diffusion, as
a biharmonic operator. Lateral viscosity is set to zero, except in the sponge layers, where
it increases linearly toward the boundaries of the model. Vertical mixing consists in the
KPP (K-profile parameterization) scheme (Large et al., 1994).

To this set of equations must be added, to a given configuration, a set of initial and
boundary conditions, as well as surface forcing, which will be detailed in part in the con-
figuration description, and in part throughout the work, because each chapter requires a
different forcing, depending on the particular study and its objectives.

The configurations discussed in this work, not only resolve the large-scale circulation
patterns and their influence on the coastal transition zone of WIM, but also resolve ex-
plicitly a unique small-scale feature consisting in the Mediterranean outflow through the
Strait of Gibraltar. Given the different scales that influence the circulation of the WIM,
ranging from the few kilometers of the Strait of Gibraltar dynamics, to the hundreds to
thousands kilometers scale of the Azores Current system, a simulation based on nesting
techniques was performed, as detailed below.

As a final note, most of the computations, from ROMS data handling to grid interpo-
lation, were possible through the use of the ROMS tools provided by Penven et al. (2008).

1.4.3 Large Domain

The strategy to manage a large range of scales consists in the implementation of a two-
domain approach. A large-scale first domain (FD — Figure 1.2 a) is run independently in
order to provide initial and boundary conditions to our second domain (SD — Figure 1.2 b)

12



through an offline nesting. The first domain horizontal resolution is 1/10o (? 9 km in
longitude), and the main aim for this domain is to resolve the large-scale circulation features
such as the Azores Current, and its interaction with the Atlantic margin of the Iberian
Peninsula.

For this domain, 30 sigma vertical levels are used, with a stretching factor of ?s = 7 and
?b = 0 to conserve a good near-surface resolution over the entire domain. The bathymetry
is based on ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins, 2009), with corrections near the slope and a
smoothing filter to fulfill the r = ?h/2h criteria (Haidvogel and Beckmann, 1999), r &amp;lt;0.2.

The World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA-2009) climatology is used as the initial value for
the temperature (Locarnini et al., 2010) and salinity (Antonov et al., 2010) fields, and
also to recycle these fields along the nudging bands, providing open boundary conditions.
These open boundary conditions were established by Marchesiello et al. (2001), with inflow
(outflow) nudging timescales of 1 (360) day(s) for tracers and 10 (360) days for momentum,
respectively. Sponge layers are applied along the edges with a band of 120 km, with a
lateral viscosity coefficient ranging from 600 m2s?1 at the boundary to zero at the interior.
Explicit viscosity and diffusivity is null, and a linear drag formulation with coefficient
r = 3 × 10?4 m s?1 is applied at the bottom.

Surface forcing varies, depending on what is intended from a given ROMS run. Since
this work focused on different aspects of the WIM dynamics, in different space and time
scales, several simulations are carried out, each forced with a different dataset, described in
due course. However, the surface forcing computation is similar: initial velocities are zero,
and monthly geostrophic velocities (with level of reference 1200 m) and Ekman velocities
are calculated from the dataset and applied along the open boundaries. The Mediterranean
undercurrent is introduced as a nudging zone, in the interior, as described by Peliz et al.
(2007), in order to restore the hydrographic properties of the Mediterranean levels.

1.4.4 High-Resolution Domain

The target domain, SD (stands for second domain, see Figure 1.2) has a horizontal
resolution of 1/27o (? 3 km in longitude), and includes the Gulf of Cadiz, the WIM, and
part of the western Bay of Biscay, extending for ? 1300 km in the meridional direction,
from 34oN to 46oN. In the zonal direction, the domain extends from the Strait of Gibraltar,
located at 5.5oW to 12.5oW, representing a width of about 600 km.

Sixty sigma vertical levels with ?s = 4 and ?b = 0 are used to properly resolve the
Mediterranean undercurrent with enough near-bottom resolution. In this way, the grid
has 60 × 188 × 389 cells.

The topography by Sibuet et al. (2004) was used, which has a resolution of ? 1 km
and was smoothed in order to fulfill the same r-factor criteria (r &amp;lt;0.2) of the large-scale
domain.

The initialization and the boundary conditions are obtained using one year from FD,
with average data stored every 3 days. The choice of the year that provides these conditions
to SD was based on the kinetic energy (KE), averaged over the entire FD. Year 5 was
the year that showed the least fluctuations in KE, and therefore was used as initial and

13



boundary conditions for SD. An experiment using year 7 of FD showed similar results for
the SD run.

Also, similarly to the large-scale simulation, a nudging sponge layer is introduced. Open
boundary conditions are the same as for the FD configuration; however the sponge layers
are applied to a band of 40 km, with a lateral viscosity coefficient ranging from 200 m2s?1

at the boundary to zero at the interior. A quadratic drag coefficient of 5 × 10?3 is used.
At the Strait of Gibraltar, at the southeastern boundary, the water exchange with the
Mediterranean basin is explicitly represented in the domain, with the methodology of Peliz
et al. (2007), consisting in the imposition of vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and
zonal velocity at the 5 grid points at the Strait. This condition is designed to setup a
transport of 0.8 Sv leaving the domain through the surface layer, and 0.7 Sv entering
the domain through the bottom layer. The process of entrainment of Atlantic Central
Waters with the Mediterranean outflow is also parameterized by increasing the viscosity
and diffusivity coefficients in a region in which the MW is strongly mixed with the overlying
Atlantic waters, until the MW vein forms along the northern slope of the Gulf of Cadiz.

The inflow of freshwater in the ocean, originated from the main rivers of the region
(white lines in Figure 1.2 b), is included. For the Portuguese rivers, climatological values
were provided by INAG (Water Institute of Portugal); the information on the Spanish
rivers was provided by Barja and Lestega?s (1992).

The spin-up time for this domain, in which the KE stabilizes, is 5 years, as the adjust-
ment time of the Mediterranean outflow along the western and northern Iberian Margin is
quite a slow process.

Surface forcings are in agreement with the corresponding large domain configuration
for a given run. More information on the configurations is given each chapter / section.

1.5 Outline

Table 1.1 summarizes all the ROMS simulations carried out. Our target domain is SD;
hence it is the one we focus on most. The numerical approach is always offline nesting,
which means that in all cases there are always two runs carried out: one FD, one SD.
Furthermore, each run has always the same dataset as initial and boundary conditions:
the former WOA09, the latter one year of FD.

The outline of this work is as follows: chapter 2 presents a climatological study of the
mean and seasonal dynamics off WIM; chapter 3 addresses the interannual variability of the
upper ocean circulation for period 2001-2011; for the same period, a larval connectivity and
dispersal study is carried out in chapter 4; chapter 5 consists in a sensitivity study on the
ability of global climate models to force regional ocean configurations; finally, in chapter 6,
this is put to use in a future ocean simulation where possible changes in hydrography and
dynamics are explored.

Chapter 2

Mean and Seasonal Characterization
of the Upper Ocean off Western
Iberian Margin

The contents of this chapter have been published by Nolasco et al. (2013a) and Cordeiro
Pires et al. (2013a).

2.1 Overview

This chapter focuses on the equilibrium circulation of the WIM current system. The
main purpose is to characterize the mean seasonal hydrography and the resulting circulation
in the upper layers of the ocean, including the surface layer, the underlying central waters,
and the intermediate Mediterranean Water levels. In order to do so, numerical simulations
were setup forced by climatological heat and momentum fluxes, that is, the circulation
is dictated by the intrinsic variability of the model, and in the absence of any external
interannual atmospheric or oceanic forcing.

The study will particularly aim at an integrated discussion of the three main dynamical
phenomena of WIM: coastal upwelling, poleward flow (IPC) and Mediterranean Water
outflow, which, although independent, are intimately linked. Although the region dynamics
is strongly seasonal, the question of the prevalence of poleward flow throughout the year
is addressed, based also on observational studies, as well as the generation of vorticity
structures of the mean flow along the WIM.

Furthermore, in this chapter, a Lagrangian study is carried out, with the purpose of
evaluating the origin of the waters that are upwelled along the WIM, from a climatolog-
ical point of view. Studying the origin of upwelled waters in an upwelling system may
be useful for several purposes: providing scales of dispersion in the marine environment,
regarding biological issues (e.g. larval dispersal lengths or fisheries) or pollution studies;
studying connectivity between marine populations (further carried out in chapter 4); in-
dicating climate variability; amongst others. The development of regional ocean modeling

and their increasing resolution and features have made it possible to apply particle mod-
ules to the ocean model 3D grid and trace the particles throughout the model run. In
this way, one is able to follow the 3D trajectories, and even hydrographic and dynamical
properties, allowing studies of a diverse nature to be carried out (e.g. Domingues et al.,
2012). Chhak and Di Lorenzo (2007) found that during the warm/cold phase of the Pa-
cific Decadal Oscillation upwelled waters at the California upwelling system originated at
shallower/deeper levels. Blanke et al. (2009) were able to study the variability of water
transfers between the adjacent regions of the Benguela upwelling system, which strongly
influence the spawning of anchovies. Albert et al. (2010) showed, through the same means,

18



that the distance and depth of origin of the particles surfacing at the Humboldt upwelling
system were dependent on the coastal wind stress curl. At the North American western
coast, the origin of upwelled waters off Oregon was addressed by Rivas and Samelson (2011)
through numerical modeling, who found that the waters that upwell there could come from
alongshore northern locations or from offshore sites to the west, mostly from depths greater
than 100 m, although the sources depended strongly on the region and the tendency to
generate mesoscale features.

The chapter is organized as such: after a description of the data and the method-
ology (section 2.2), a brief validation of FD is carried out (section 2.3), followed by an
hydrographic validation of the high-resolution domain, SD (section 2.4). Then, the mean
flow vertical and horizontal structure is analyzed in detail (section 2.5), and the final sec-
tion addresses the Lagrangian study carried out over the same climatological ROMS run
(section 2.6).

2.2 Data and Methodology

2.2.1 Model Configurations

Surface fluxes are provided by the Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set
(COADS). COADS has been, by excellence, the used climatology for such regional ocean
modeling studies (e.g. Marchesiello et al. 2001). This COADS version is an enhanced cli-
matology originated from a joint effort of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)
and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC — http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/)
(da Silva et al. 1994) which resulted in an optimized COADS for the period 1945-1989 cli-
matology for both atmosphere and ocean, with an improved resolution of 0.5o×0.5o (except
sea surface salinity, which has a resolution of 1o ×1o). This is a monthly mean climatology
without interannual variability comprised by heat fluxes (shortwave, longwave and latent),
water fluxes (evaporation minus precipitation), wind stress, sea surface temperature (SST),
and sea surface salinity (SSS).

The absence of an ocean-atmosphere feedback term can lead to model SST drift. This
problem is addressed in ROMS by an air-sea feedback parameterization that is added to
the surface flux (Veitch et al. 2010). This is done using the COADS SST distribution, and
a similar correction scheme is used for SSS.

2.2.2 Climatology

The first part of the model output analysis is a comparison with climatological data.
Two datasets were chosen to carry out this comparison: the recent climatological GHER
atlas for the Northeast Atlantic (Troupin et al., 2010) (hereafter GHER-NEA climatology)
and satellite products. The GHER-NEA climatology was chosen for its high resolution
(0.1o), which properly resolves the slope and shelf regions unlike most available climatolo-
gies, and both temperature and salinity are compared to model results.

19



2.2.3 Satellite Products

For the sea surface temperature (SST), the comparison is carried out with data from the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration (NOAA). The data was extracted from the EUMETSAT Ocean &amp;amp;
Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) (www.osi-saf.org) and was made available
by CERSAT (IFREMER, France). The product has an approximate resolution of 2 km.
The final data consists in 7-year averages, corresponding to years 2002 to 2008, for January
and July, of the night satellite sweep (hereafter satellite climatology).

2.2.4 Altimetry Products

The altimetry data were retrieved from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and In-
terpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data) website (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/).
The altimeter products were made available by Ssalto/Duacs (Segment Sol multimissions
d’ALTime?trie, d’Orbitographie et de localisation pre?cise / Data unification and altimetry
combination system), with support from Cnes (French national center for space studies).
Ssalto/Duacs system processes data from all altimeter missions (Jason-1&amp;amp;2, T/P, Envisat,
GFO, ERS-1 &amp;amp; 2 and Geosat) to provide a consistent and homogeneous catalog of products
for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. Altimetry
weekly data was obtained from AVISO for the period October 1992 to July 2011.

2.3 Large Domain Validation

The FD domain was designed to solve the large-scale circulation in order to provide
boundary conditions to the target domain SD. It is not intended to discuss the circulation
resulting from this domain, but to show an example of how the large-scale circulation is
solved for this domain. For that purpose, an Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) comparison
between altimetry and FD output is done in Figure 2.2. The signature of the Azores
Current is clear between 33oN and 36oN, and the signal extends east to ? 12oW in both.
There is also evidence of the North Atlantic Current at the northwestern corner of the FD
domain. In terms of magnitude, EKE is more intense in ROMS for the Azores Current,
and more intense in AVISO for the North Atlantic Current. Nevertheless, the comparison
is acceptable and hence FD is reproducing well the regional dynamics energetically.

2.4 High-Resolution Domain Validation

The WIM hydrography resulting from the model solutions is analyzed by comparing the
modeled horizontal and vertical temperature and salinity distributions with the GHER-
NEA climatological data described above, with the exception of SST, which is compared
to satellite data. Therefore, both SD and climatology temperature and salinity fields are
represented through mean seasonal surface fields, ?-S diagrams and zonal vertical sections.

2.4.1 Surface Fields

Figure 2.3 presents the January mean sea surface temperature (SST) (upper row) and
salinity (SSS) (lower row) of both SD and the corresponding climatology, as well as the
difference between the modeled and the climatological fields. Figure 2.4 is the correspond-
ing image for the month of July.

a. Winter
During winter (Figure 2.3), both SD and the climatologies show the existence of a

meridional gradient of sea surface temperature and salinity. A tongue of saltier and warmer
water centered at approximately 9.5oW-10oW is also observed, which is associated with the
poleward advection of waters with subtropical origin, frequently referred to in the literature
as the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) (A?lvarez-Salgado et al., 2003). Although this tongue
is visible in both SST and SSS, it is less evident in the SST satellite field. Moreover, the
poleward penetration of the climatological tongue reaches farther north than the SD one,
causing a difference of about -0.1 in salinity between 39oN and 42oN.

Along the continental shelf, north of the Estremadura Promontory, a band of buoyant
fresher and colder waters is observed in the SST and SSS climatologies, as well as in the
SD averages. This band is associated with the presence of winter river inflow along the
western coast, mainly contributed to by Tagus, Mondego, Douro, Minho and the Galician
Rias rivers (see Figure 1.2 b). This fresh water signature lingers over the continental shelf,
generating the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume (WIBP) (Peliz et al., 2002; Otero et al.,
2008), that can reach as far as 40 km offshore.

b. Summer
During summer (Figure 2.4), the most important phenomenon observed is coastal up-

welling induced by the predominant equatorward winds along the WIM, which results in
the presence of a coastal band of cold and fresh waters. From north to south, both the
SD (Figure 2.4 a,d) and the climatological (Figure 2.4 b,e) offshore temperature (salinity)
fields increase from 18oC (35.7) in the northern region to 22oC (36.4) in the Gulf of Cadiz.
Moreover, the offshore isotherms and isohalines bend southward encompassing the pres-
ence of the coastal band of upwelled water from the southern coast of Portugal up to Cape
Ortegal, the northern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.

Thus, the main patterns of the July average temperature and salinity for the offshore
region are well reproduced in SD, resulting in low temperature and salinity differences
(Figure 2.4 c,f). However, SD tends to overestimate the intensity of upwelling, presenting
a coastal water band that is colder than the satellite climatology. As discussed by Veitch et
al. (2010), and references herein, the climatological winds do not account for the drop-off
of the wind stress in the neighborhood of the coast.

There are also regions in which SD, on the contrary, overestimates the surface temper-
ature. Along the Galician coast, north of Cape Finisterre, unlike SD results, filaments are

frequently observed by satellite in this area (Torres et al., 2003).
Other regions where SD temperatures are warmer than observed are northern Gulf

of Cadiz (Portuguese southern coast) and the northern coast of Morocco. These regions
are influenced by the gap winds, which consist in strong easterly winds associated with
pressure differences between both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar (Peliz et al, 2009), not
represented in the climatological winds.

The summer SSS field (Figure 2.4 d) is characterized by the upwelling of Eastern North
Atlantic Central Waters with northern origin (ENACWsp), which are advected southward.
This upwelled water has a typical salinity signature of about 35.8. Underlying the upwelled
Central Water, there is a low salinity surface water (lower than 35.7) observed in the
GHER-NEA climatology (Figure 2.4 e), which is associated with the remnant of the WIBP
advected offshore by Ekman transport, giving rise to a low salinity plume at the surface.
This band of fresher water is not well resolved by SD, and accounts for the major differences
between model and the GHER-NEA climatology (Figure 2.4 f). The reason for this is
that COADS winds are almost constant during summer, which promotes, through Ekman
transport, the offshore dispersal of the WIBP and its dilution, while in nature, in the
presence of variable winds, the plume remains trapped to the coastal region. On the other
hand, in the remaining places, the salinity differences are mostly within ±0.1 between SD
and the climatology.

2.4.2 Water Masses

To compare the SD water mass properties with the climatological values, ?-S diagrams
were elaborated for two regions (boxes with 1o of length and width) centered at 10oW and
latitudes 38oN and 42oN (see Figure 2.1 for location). These diagrams are displayed in
Figure 2.5. For each box, monthly (January, April, July and October) mean profiles of po-
tential temperature and salinity were calculated from years 10 to 14 of the simulation (one
dashed line per year, in order to show the interannual variability), and are superimposed
to the GHER-NEA climatology (solid line).

The seasonal evolution of the thermohaline properties of the central and surface waters
is reasonably well reproduced by SD when compared with the climatological values. Con-
cerning the Central Water properties of both SD and climatology, by comparison with the
standard straight lines in the ?-S space for ENACWst and ENACWsp, it is clear that the
northern (southern) region is more influenced by the presence of the subpolar (subtropical)
branch of the ENACW.

For the southern region, in January (Figure 2.5 a), the Central Waters have their
thermohaline properties superimposed with the ENACWst line, typical of the waters that
give origin to the IPC. Below the surface, salinity decreases linearly to a minimum of 35.7,
near the 27.1 isopycnal, and increases downward due to the influence of the underlying MW
mass, up to a maximum of 36.2 on the 27.6 isopycnal, which is about 0.15 lower than the
climatological value. In April (Figure 2.5 b), a decrease of the surface salinity maximum is
observed, associated with the start of the upwelling season. During summer (Figure 2.5 c),
the seasonal heating modifies the ?-S structure at the surface, by increasing the temperature

of the surface layer. There is also interannual variability of the temperature at the surface
layers. The SD MW mass is fairly well reproduced, ranging from 36.2 to 36.35, which
includes the climatological value. In October (Figure 2.5 d), after the upwelling season,
the signature of saltier surface waters associated with the IPC is visible both in the SD
and the climatology, although SD underestimates the surface salinity by about -0.1 units,
and presents this same difference in respect to the MW mass.

Regarding the northern region (centered at 42oN, 10oW, Figure 2.5 e-h), the seasonal
evolution of the ?-S field follows a similar pattern to that described for the southern region,
since the main differences are observed in the salinity field at the surface levels, with lower
maximum values of salinity in both winter and summer. At the MW levels, the salinity
signature decreases poleward as expected.

Overall, the SD configuration not only follows the seasonal cycle of temperature and
salinity for the surface and central waters, but also reproduces the MW hydrographic
properties, although some negative biases are observed (as well as in the MW core depths,
as discussed later).

2.4.3 Vertical Structure

As a complementary analysis of the water masses in the two regions discussed above, we
intend to study the vertical distribution of the hydrographic properties, and to compare
the modeled values with the GHER-NEA climatology. The aim is to show and discuss
the modeled temperature and salinity fields and to compare them to climatological values
across two latitudes, 42oN and 38oN, representative of the northern and southern WIM,
respectively. Additionally, a meridional section of temperature and salinity off WIM con-
cludes the winter hydrography characterization. The averages for SD were computed for
January and July of simulation years 10 to 14, down to 1500 m in depth.

a. Winter Hydrography
At 42oN (Figure 2.6 a,c), the winter distribution of temperature and salinity shows a

general downward sloping of the isohalines in the upper slope region (down to about 400 m),
between 9.5oW and 11oW. This downward tendency is associated with the presence of the
IPC during wintertime, with salinities higher than 35.9 and temperatures around 14.5o.
The SD IPC (Figure 2.6 a) shows evidence of this poleward advection at the surface; how-
ever, there is a bias of about -1oC in temperature and -0.1 in salinity. On the other hand,
the salinity minimum of ENACWsp of 35.65 (see Figure 2.5 e) is reached at depths around
400 m, shallower than the climatological minimum (450 m). Below that depth lies the MW
and thus the salinity field increases accordingly to 36 near the slope at an approximate
depth of 900 m, which is -0.1 fresher and 100 m shallower than the climatological value.

For the southern latitude, 38oN (Figure 2.6 b,d), the surface layers are characterized
by the presence of saltier and warmer waters when compared to the northern section. In
January, for the surface and central water range, the hydrographic properties reflect the
straight line observed in the ?-S diagrams (Figure 2.5 a). Concerning the MW, below the

ENACW, the SD temperature maximum (? 12oC) does not reach as far offshore as the
climatological one (extending to 10.5oW whereas in SD the isotherm is close to the slope),
but the depth at which they are found (800 m) is the same. On the other hand, the lower
core SD MW salinity maximum, 36.2, is underestimated (-0.1), as is the depth at which
this maximum is found (about 1000 m in SD and 1200 m in the climatology). Below the
MW, the transition to LSW in SD is located at lower depths than the climatological value.

The upper levels meridional distribution of the temperature and salinity fields along
the WIM at 11.5oW (Figure 2.7) shows evidence of a large-scale gradient with southern
warmer and saltier waters of subtropical origins and northern colder and fresher waters of
subpolar origins. A frontal region, frequently observed between 38 and 40oN and denoted
by Western Iberia Winter Front (Peliz et al., 2005) separates both regions.

This meridional density gradient is partly at the origin of the Iberian Poleward current
system (Peliz et al., 2003). A proper representation of the meridional distribution of hy-
drographic fields is needed to obtain a realistic poleward current system along the WIM.
Here, we observe similar meridional gradients of temperature and salinity in the upper
levels (0-200 m), although ROMS presents lower salinities north of 43oN and south of 37oN
(roughly differences of -0.1) and lower temperatures of about -0.5oC to the north reaching
1oC to the south. At depth, both the ENACW and the MW signatures are clearly ob-
served, the former at 400-600 m with typical salinities of 35.6- 35.7 and the latter centered
at 1000-1200 m with maximum salinities of 35.2-35.3 and a temperature of 11oC.

b. Summer Hydrography
Similarly to the winter situation, the summer vertical structure is analyzed for zonal

sections at 42oN and 38oN. At the northern section (Figure 2.8 a,c) the summer circulation
is well characterized by the presence of coastal upwelling, which affects clearly the near-
surface temperature field distribution on the continental shelf. The isotherms warmer than
14oC outcrop on the shelf, generating a front in the numerical configuration. Note that
the GHER-NEA climatology shows evidence of upwelling, although the frontal structure
is smoothed, as expected from an observational climatological dataset.

The upwelling of the isothermal field extends down to the 13oC isotherm at approxi-
mately 200 m in both SD and climatology. At the surface layers summer salinity is lower
than during winter because the signature of ENACWst is not observed, as the upwelled
waters have a northern origin. A minimum of salinity is nevertheless observed, similarly
to winter, with the 35.6 isohaline located at approximately 400 m.

Concerning the MW distribution in July, at 42oN there are no significant differences
with respect to wintertime in the climatology: the same salinity maximum at approximately
1000 m, enclosed by the 35.9 isohalines between 700-800 m and 1200-1300 m. In SD, the
MW vein seems to be squeezed and the temperature field is upwelled by about 100 m with
respect to the winter equilibrium depth, as observed by Garcia-Lafuente et al. (2008), who
related the shallowing of the MW vein with its mesoscale field, and whose origin may be
related with the variability of the wind field.

The southern section, 38oN (Figure 2.8 b,d), is also affected by upwelling during sum-

mer. In this case the outcropped isotherm is 15oC in SD against 17.5oC in the climatology.
At the levels of the MW vein, the main difference between SD and climatology is the 200 m
depth difference in the location of the salinity maximum, whereas SD reaches the same
climatological maximum of 36.3.

2.5 Mean Flow Structure

The main focus of this section is the analysis of the circulation in the WIM resulting
from the process of adjustment of the hydrographic fields. Horizontal slices at 50 m and
1000 m depth showing monthly means for years 10 to 14 of the SD run of the salinity and
velocity fields for January and July are displayed in Figure 2.9. In addition, vertical slices
of the alongshore circulation at northern (43oN), central (40oN) and southern (37.5oN)
locations of the WIM are displayed in Figure 2.10, also for January and July monthly
means. Finally, the computation of meridional transport across these same three zonal
sections were also carried out.

2.5.1 Winter Circulation

One of the main dynamical features at the western Gulf of Cadiz is the presence of a
permanent cyclonic circulation (C1 in Figure 2.9 b), which is part of the usually referred
to as topographic ?-plume circulation (Kida et al., 2008). Lamas et al. (2010) provided
observational evidence of the structure. This cyclonic vortex is stronger at the surface, but
has a clear signature in depth as well (Figure 2.9 a,b).

The circulation in the WIM is conditioned by the entrance of the MW vein at the
gateway between Cape St Vincent and the Gorringe Bank; furthermore, along its path
around the WIM, the current sometimes becomes unstable and separates from the slope
at different locations, generating successive anticyclonic structures (Meddies) (Zenk and
Armi, 1990). As a consequence of the process of spreading of the MW vein, when the flow
turns to the Tagus Basin, the resulting mean flow is observed to generate mean vorticity
structures, two of them (anticyclonic and cyclonic) trapped to the slope, denoted A1 and
C2 in Figure 2.9 b, and an anticyclonic mean structure offshore, denoted by A2. This
complex recirculation system is also evident in Figure 2.10 e. In the northern side of the
Estremadura Promontory the flow progresses poleward, giving rise to a partial detachment
and an anticyclonic structure, denoted A3, which extend from the MW levels up to the
surface (Figures 2.9 b and 2.10 c).

Evidences in the literature of this conspicuous negative vorticity in this region are
discussed by Daniault et al. (1994) and Maze? et al. (1997). On the other hand, a region
of anticyclonic vorticity is frequently observed near 40oN in the SST field, separating the
southern waters (warmer and saltier) that progress poleward from the northern waters
(fresher and colder). Furthermore, a detailed discussion of this anticyclonic region in the
framework of the dynamics of the IPC is presented by Peliz et al. (2003a, 2005).

North of 40oN, a flow bifurcation is observed (Figure 2.9 b). Part of the flow veers cy-
clonically and becomes part of a northwestward flow that leaves the domain at 42oN, 12oW
south of the Galicia Bank; the other part of the flow reattaches to the slope and continues
poleward, flowing along Cape Finisterre at 43oN. At this latitude (Figure 2.10 a), this
poleward flow is associated with a downward slope of the isopycnal field centered at about
10oW and extending upward from the levels of the MW up to the surface, while offshore
of 10oW a weak equatorward flow is dominant.

The 43oN section in the work of Maze? et al. (1997) shows similar circulation, with
maximum poleward tendency at ? 9.75oW, and equatorward flow from 10.5oW to 12oW,
which is attributed in part to the recirculation around the Galicia Bank.

The circulation at 50 m (Figure 2.9 a) shows similar patterns to those at 1000 m,
showing coupling between the MW and the surface layers as further discussed below.

2.5.2 Summer Circulation

The summer circulation at the MW levels (Figure 2.9 d) presents a similar general
behavior to that of winter, discussed above. The inflow in the Tagus Basin occurs more
trapped to the slope than in January, with less evidence of southward recirculation (A1 in
Figure 2.9 b) and stronger poleward flow between 9.5oW and 10.5oW. Offshore (10.5oW to
12oW) there is a weakening of both poleward and equatorward signatures (Figure 2.10 f).

The anticyclonic structure centered at 40oN, 11oW presents a weaker signature than
the one observed in winter, meaning less tendency to detach from the northern flank of the
Estremadura Promontory, and hence stronger slope-trapped flow at the levels of the MW,
with maximum poleward flow at 1200 m depth (Figure 2.10 d).

North of this latitude, a weaker flow separation tendency south of the Galicia Bank
is observed, when compared to the winter case. The tendency for the slope-trapping of
the MW vein observed at 40oN during summer is further confirmed at the 43oN section
(Figure 2.10 b), in which the maximum poleward velocity is 10 cm s?1 at 1000 m depth and
extending up to the surface with some vertical tilting in the poleward flow structure. One
of the most striking features in our modeled mean circulation for summer is the existence
of conspicuous poleward flow during this season. This issue will be further discussed below.
Concerning the surface layers circulation (Figure 2.9 c), a band of equatorward flow along
the continental shelf/upper slope is observed associated with the upwelling front, with
particular notice to the velocities between Cape Ortegal and Cape Finisterre, replacing
part of the northward branch of the poleward flow in winter.

2.5.3 Meridional Transport

In order to obtain some insights about the seasonal and interannual variability of the
circulation, series of alongshore transport were computed across the same three zonal
sections (43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN) and integrated in the upper 1500 m depth range. As
visible in Figure 2.10, there is strong coupling between the circulation at the levels of MW
and those of the central waters, as documented by Maze? et al. (1997).

Figure 2.11: Time series of meridional transport (Sv) monthly means across (upper row)
43oN; (middle row) 40oN; and (lower row) 37.5oN. Each column corresponds to a sub-
section represented in the rightmost column (d,h,l). From left to right: (a,e,i) offshore;
(b,f,j) lower slope and adjacent upper layers; (c,g,k) shelf/upper slope (down to 400 m).
Seasonal averages (July, August, September — JAS — and November, December, January
— NDJ) are plotted in shades of gray for northward and southward transports. To the
left of each plot, total northward and southward averages are in black bars and the net
average is in white bars.

Results are shown in Figure 2.11. Each zonal section is divided into three sub-sections
(hereafter called boxes for simplicity): shelf/upper slope (from the coast to the 400 m
isobath), lower slope and offshore box. These boxes will hereafter be designated as onshore,
central and offshore boxes, respectively. The boxes are defined individually for each section
because the location of both the upper and lower slope circulation varies with latitude, as
seen in Figure 2.10. The border of the onshore box was designed to accommodate the
shelf circulation, and was therefore defined by setting the depth at the 400 m isobath.
The separation between the central and the offshore boxes was carried out by defining the
central box as the area of prevailing poleward flow (see Figure 2.10).

Thus, monthly means of meridional net transport, with positive (negative) values cor-
responding to poleward (equatorward) flow, are shown for 43oN (Figure 2.11 a-c), 40oN
(Figure 2.11 e-g) and 37.5oN (Figure 2.11 i-k).

At the onshore boxes (Figure 2.11 c,g,k), the main feature observed is the equatorward
flow due to upwelling, which presents one main peak centered in July-August and occasion-
ally one or several minor peaks during spring. In wintertime, a poleward flow associated
with the inshore intrusion of the IPC is observed on the upper slope. The equatorward
summer transport peak is typically 0.5 Sv independent of the latitude, but the spring peak
spans from less than 0.1 Sv to about 0.3 Sv. Although a clear seasonal cycle of the circula-
tion is seen for both upwelling and poleward flow, there is also some interannual variability
in the structure of the peaks associated with the upwelling equatorward transport, both
in width and intensity. Observing the seasonal cycle, some differences can be remarked
regarding the equatorward circulation at different latitudes. In the northern and central
sections (43oN and 40oN, respectively — Figure 2.11 c,g), the equatorward flow starts
early in the year (February) and lingers on until October, whereas in southern Portugal
(37.5oN — Figure 2.11 k) a weak and variable circulation is observed during springtime
(February to May), and the clear signal of upwelling appears in June-July. Furthermore,
poleward flow along the shelf/upper slope is observed every year for the 43oN and 40oN
sections, with typical values of 0.2 to 0.3 Sv, starting recursively at the beginning of au-
tumn and with peaks in December, occasionally with secondary peaks in January. The
southern region does not show clear evidences of poleward flow on the upper slope/shelf.

In respect to the central (Figure 2.11 b,f,j) and offshore (Figure 2.11 a,e,i) boxes, the
transport patterns are not so clearly defined as in the case of the onshore box. For the
northern and central latitudes (43oN and 40oN) at the central box (Figure 2.11 b,f), two
peaks of poleward flow are observed throughout the year in almost all simulation years:
the first one during summertime (July to September), presenting high transport values,
from 3 to 10 Sv; the second peak with smaller amplitudes, 2 to 7 Sv, is observed from
November to January. Both transport peaks have strong interannual variability in terms
of magnitude. The first peak appears as an offshore poleward flow co-existing with the
inshore summer upwelling peak (cf. Figure 2.10 b with Figure 2.10 c and Figure 2.10f with
Figure 2.10 g). This offshore shifting of poleward flow during the upwelling season has also
been reported in hydrographical cruises (Peliz et al., 2002; Torres and Barton, 2007). The
second peak is associated with the winter IPC. Conversely, every year, recurrent peaks of
equatorward transport are observed during the late winter-spring months. The southern

37



region at the central box (Figure 2.11 j) presents a complex pattern, although the tendency
for poleward flow with multiple peaks during summer (shaded), late autumn and January
is still discernible. The tendency for equatorward flow observed during late winter and
spring is only partially met. Recall that this box is strongly influenced by the MW vein
and the corresponding shedding of Meddies, which makes it more difficult to interpret than
the patterns described for the northern region. Moorings analysis at about 42oN (from the
French project ARCANE, Huthnance et al., 2002, and Colas, 2003) showed that at the
depths of ENACW and MW the maximum of poleward flow occurred between August
and October, although at the surface this maximum was found in December-January;
furthermore, in February-March a direction reversal at those levels was observed, with
equatorward flows of 5 to 10 cm s?1. From float data, the same authors discuss that there
is a clear slope current of about 2 cm s?1 but that the major poleward flow occurs between
600 and 1400 m.

The offshore region (Figure 2.11 a,e,i) is the widest of the three sub-sections, and does
not present a clear seasonal pattern as the central and onshore boxes. The northern off-
shore box (Figure 2.11 a) is characterized by a tendency for equatorward flow, with typical
values of less than 5 Sv, as previously discussed (Figure 2.10 a,d). This behavior is op-
posite to the central box at the same latitude (Figure 2.11 b), meaning that at 43oN the
poleward flow is preferentially attached to the slope (central box), which Figure 2.9 b,d
also shows. At 40oN (Figure 2.11 e), the offshore box is characterized by high values of
transport in both directions, resulting from the anticyclonic vorticity structure of the mean
circulation (denoted A3 in Figure 2.9 b and visible in Figure 2.10 b,e). Maze? et al. (1997)
refer to a circulation of about 6 Sv for the MW levels at this latitude associated with an
anticyclonic structure of large dimensions, and Daniault et al. (1994) discuss the existence
of anticyclonic vorticity there (see discussion above). However, the net overall contribution
(Figure 2.11 e) is poleward during the summer months with strong interannual variabil-
ity, and presents peaks of poleward flow in February-March. This late winter poleward
transport is delayed by two to three months relative to the peaks observed in the central
box at 40oN (Figure 2.11 f), which can be interpreted as the westward IPC migration.
On the other hand, the separation of the flow associated with A3 occurring north of the
Estremadura Promontory also explains the poleward tendency in this offshore box.

The southern (37.5oN) offshore region (Figure 2.11 i) is affected by a strong variabil-
ity, consequence of the spreading of the MW vein and its mesoscale features. However,
similarly to the central box, some features can be observed, such as peaks of poleward
current during summertime (shaded), and during November-January for most of the years,
but also equatorward peaks mainly observed between February and June every year. This
equatorward flow is, as discussed above, partially associated with recirculation of the pole-
ward flow across the central box. When comparing this offshore transport to the central
box one at the same latitude, transport has a clearer tendency for poleward flow at the
central box than the offshore one. This is understandable since most of the MW vein at
this latitude tends to circulate poleward by the central box, as shown in Figure 2.10 e,f,
where it is also evident that the offshore circulation across 37.5oN is dominated by the
presence of a mean anticyclonic vorticity structure denoted by A2 in Figure 2.9 b.

38



The meridional transport across the boxes calculated from the results of the model can
be compared to those calculated by Maze? et al. (1997) for the Bord-Est 3 cruise during
May 1989, for the sections at 37.5oN and 43oN. The authors compute meridional transport
through layers defined by density anomalies in order to quantify transport by the North
Atlantic Central Waters and by the Mediterranean Water, which corresponds roughly to
the layers comprised between the surface and 1500 m depth. Furthermore, the results of
the sampled stations provide the transport distribution in longitude ranges, which renders
possible a comparison to the modeled results. Table 2.1 displays meridional transport
averages through 43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN, both northward (positive — Q+

y
) and southward

(negative — Q?
y
), as well as the net transport. Additionally, the transport through the

entire section is also computed. The values in the work of Maze? et al. (1997) (hereafter
observations) were obtained from their Figures 12 and 13 (a,c). The sub-sections refer to
the boxes defined in Figure 2.11 for SD and the most approximate values with respect
to the stations presented by Maze? et al. (1997). Absent values in the observations mean
no available data. It is important to keep in mind that the observations concern a single
month, whereas our results are 5-year averaged transport across every section.

For the northern section at 43oN (first column), similar transport values are reported,
which consist in prevailing northward transport in the central box and prevailing southward
transport in the offshore box, giving rise to a full net southward transport of about 1 Sv
for SD and about 2 Sv for the observations. For the southern region at 37.5oN (last
column), transport calculation is more complicated because of the presence of a Meddy in
the observations, partially sampled along the western side of the section, that accounts for
about 6.6 Sv of southward transport at the MW levels. Therefore, the transport through
the offshore box was corrected subtracting this value from the southward total, which would
amount to 21.4 instead of the 14.8 Sv presented in Table 2.1, as marked with an asterisk.
The southward transports are similar in magnitude. As for the northward transport, in
SD at the central box, values are lower than the observations (6.2 Sv against 10.2 Sv, a
difference of 4 Sv); however, they are higher at the offshore box with the same difference
of 4 Sv (12.5 Sv against 8.5 Sv for the observations), which may mean that the poleward
flow crosses 37.5oN at different longitudes. There can be another explanation. Following
the interpretation of Maze? et al. (1997), from the 10.2 Sv that flow northward across
the central box, approximately half continues northward, and the other half recirculates
southward to the west, that is, its contribution adds to the offshore southward transport
of 14.8 Sv (as schematically represented in Figure 15 of their work). Then, the exceeding
northward transport in SD at the offshore box may be due to the anticyclonic vorticity
structure (see Figure 2.9 b and Figure 2.10 c,f), which in the observations is west of 12oW
and is therefore not taken into account.

Although Maze? et al. (1997) do not provide data for 40oN, the model results are also
shown in Table 2.1 (middle column). Transport is, in terms of balance, northward at the
offshore box and southward at the central and inshore boxes. This is due to the separation
of the flow that occurs at this latitude, associated with the mean anticyclonic vorticity
region discussed in this section (see Figure 2.9 b and Figure 2.10 b,e), which accounts for
the strong northward and southward transports at the offshore box.

2.6 Lagrangian Considerations

This section addresses the origin of upwelled waters along the Western Iberian Margin
during the upwelling season. We apply a Lagrangian particle model run back in time to
the climatological run described above, in order to trace the preferential pathways of these
waters, as well as the depths of origin and the distances traveled in one month.

2.6.1 Lagrangian Model

The Lagrangian particle model runs offline over the climatological simulation. It con-
sists in an Individual Based Model (IBM), coupled to ROMS using ROFF (Carr et al.,
2007). ROFF is a drifter-tracking code that simulates Lagrangian trajectories from stored
ROMS velocity and hydrological fields using a high-order predictor corrector scheme to
integrate the motion equation dX/dt = UROMS(X, t), with X being the position vector
(x, y, z), and UROMS being the modeled 3D velocity vector over time, given an initial con-
dition X(t0) = X0. In addition to the advection generated by the model velocities, the
particle movements include random velocities in the vertical direction, which are used to
parameterize unresolved turbulent processes.

The particle model allows the trajectories of a cluster of particles to be tracked during a
given period. Our purpose is to study the particles arriving at the Western Iberian Margin,
but since ROFF runs backward in time, the particles are actually deployed from the coastal
region along WIM where upwelling occurs, what we call areas of arrival. We defined
four areas of arrival, approximately limited offshore by the 200-m isobath (Figure 2.1):
Galician Rias (GR), Northern Portuguese Coast (NC), Estremadura Promontory (EP)
and Southern Portuguese Coast (SC). The particles were released in all grid points at
three different depths: 20 m, 40 m and 60 m. Furthermore, particles were released on
three dates: June 30, July 30 and August 30. Their trajectories were traced backward
for one month; therefore their departure points were on June 1, July 1, and August 1,
respectively. During that month of travel, we have information on the particles horizontal
and vertical displacement. The number of particles depends on the area of arrival and its
corresponding grid: 284 at GR; 388 at EP (the largest area); 325 at NC; and 156 at SC
(the narrowest). Thus, the total number of particles is three times these values, since the
study is carried out for 3 months. The Lagrangian module only runs over the last year of
simulation.

Although the configuration has been designed to track particles from the point of arrival
back to their point of origin, the discussion refers to the particles as if deployed at their
points of origin and terminating at the four arrival areas illustrated in Figure 2.1. For
simplification, particles that arrive at 20 m, 40 m and 60 m will be henceforth designated
as 20-m, 40-m and 60-m particles, respectively. In addition, the mean SST for June is also
shown, as well as the maximum southward meridional velocities. This figure will be used in
the interpretation of trajectory maps, as well as in considerations concerning the distance
of the particles from the coast, distance traveled and mean depths of origin, discussed in
the following sub-section.

Figure 2.12: Mean field of SST for June of the last year of simulation of SD. The thick
black line represents meridional velocities of -25 cm s?1 for the same month. The 200-m
isobath is shown by the blue line.

2.6.2 Trajectories

On a first approach, to avoid overloading the maps, only the preferential pathways of
upwelled waters arriving on June 30 were considered, since these were similar to the other
months studied. The left column of Figure 2.13 shows the trajectories of particles arriving
at 20 m (gray dots), 40 m (black dots) and 60 m (white dots), and the right column shows
the origin points of each particle, with the information of its depth on June 1 (t = 0) given
by the gray shades. In general, the 20-m particles have their origin at farther locations to
the north, but mainly at shallow depths. Indeed, the 200-m isobath seems to delimit the
particles trajectories, which are mainly alongshore and close to the coast. As for the 40-m
and 60-m particles, they appear to have similar trajectory patterns, their origin sometimes
located inshore to the north, others from closer offshore regions. The NC and EP locations
(Figure 2.13 c,e) show more alongshore pathways, accompanying the shoreline, whereas GR
and SC (Figure 2.13 a,g) present some meandering. These results are consistent with the

42



average signature of the upwelling and associated equatorward jet, shown in Figure 2.12.
The coastal cold band is approximately limited by the 200-m isobath, typically at 40 km
distant from the coast.

Furthermore, it is evident that, in general, the particles that originated the farthest from
their arrival site came from shallower depths. This is most evident at NC (Figure 2.13 d).
There are some exceptions, however. In GR and EP (Figure 2.13 b,f), there are some
particles whose origin is offshore the WIM at approximately 10oW and with depths of over
80 m, and also off Estremadura Promontory for particles arriving at SC (Figure 2.13 h).
It is apparent that particles originate at shallower depths at the southern coast than at
northern locations.

2.6.3 Quantitative Analysis

The following analyses concern the three sets of data, from the Lagrangian simulations
of June, July and August. Figure 2.14 shows the distribution of the depths of origin
according to region. Histogram bars correspond to depth intervals. The x-axis labels are
the maximum depths of each interval, that is: ‘-50’ corresponds to the interval 0-50 m,
‘-100’ corresponds to 50-100 m, and so forth. The first interval of 0-50 m registers the
highest occurrences for all regions and for all depths of arrival. Percentages are of 80% for
the 20-m particles, 60% to 70% for the 40-m particles from north to south, and between
30% and 50% for the 60-m particles. Regarding the other depth intervals, the behavior is
not quite as uniform. At GR (Figure 2.14 a) and EP (Figure 2.14 c), particles originate
mainly from depths between 50 and 100 m and between 150 and 200 m, but the other
depth intervals still register occurrences. At NC (Figure 2.14 b), preferential depths of
origin are 100-150 m, especially for 60-m particles (? 25%), and 200-250 m and there are
no particles arriving from depths greater than 300 m. At SC (Figure 2.14 d), particles
originate preferentially from the 50-100 m interval: 60-m particles register above 40% and
20- and 40-m particles register roughly 20%. Here, there are no particles coming from
depths of more than 200 m.

Additionally, Figure 2.15 shows the correspondence between distance traveled by the
particles, from their point of origin to the arrival point, and their depth of origin. It is
noticeable that the farther the particles have traveled from their origin, the shallower their
origin is. The northern locations register the farthest origins, all corresponding to 20-m
particles.

Observing Figure 2.12, it is clear that the highest velocities of the equatorward jet
are found north of 40oN, consistent with these results. All regions and particles show a
tendency of decrease in distance traveled as the depth of arrival increases except for SC
(Figure 2.15 d). Indeed, the southernmost location shows a homogeneous distribution of
distance traveled independently of the depth of arrival. According to Figure 2.12, the
southward velocities in this area are lower than in all others, that is, conditions are less
prone for particles to travel large distances. The deepest points of origin were mainly
recorded for the 60-m particles. It is also noticeable that these maximum depths are found
at GR and EP (Figure 2.15 a,c).

Since the trajectory maps reveal a tendency for the particles that travel the greatest
distances to trace an alongshore path limited to the upper 200 m of the water column,
the mean depth computed for each particle along its trajectory was plotted against its
mean distance to the coast (Figure 2.16). For NC and EP (Figure 2.16 b,c) the particles
that originate farthest from the coast (on average 80 km) come from the same depths as
those from which they later upwell; they essentially have surface/subsurface trajectories.
These particles may be influenced by the upwelling-associated mesoscale phenomena. On
the other hand, particles whose trajectories were traced, on average, to depths of more
than 120 m have never reached distances greater than 20 km from the coast, which is the
average distance of the 100-m isobath as discussed in the previous sub-section regarding
Figures 2.13 and 2.14. These particles seem to travel mainly through the equatorward jet
or come from lower levels directly below their upwelling site, where the associated upward
motion of replacement of surface waters with deeper waters takes place.

It is important to notice that the regions of the Galician Rias and Estremadura Promon-
tory are somewhat different from the others. The GR is characterized by a jagged coastline
with several estuaries and bays, and the EP is a prominent topographic feature. Both loca-
tions are prone to the development of filaments, that is, detachments of flow from the main
alongshore path of the equatorward jet (Torres and Barton, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009).
At these locations, the upwelled waters originate at greater depths and traveled shorter
distances, suggesting that their trajectories are dependent on local mesoscale activity. In
contrast, at the Portuguese northern and southern coasts, which are roughly meridional
coasts, upwelled waters come from larger distances and shallower depths, being mostly
dependent on the core alongshore equatorward jet, flowing within 20-40 km of the coast
and with velocities that reach 30 cm s?1, as observed in section 2.4.

2.7 Discussion

The purpose of this study was to model the mean circulation of the Western Iberian
Margin, as well as the seasonal cycle of the hydrographic fields. Three phenomena play
the most important roles in setting both hydrography and flow: summer coastal upwelling,
the Iberian Poleward Current and the Mediterranean Water outflow through the Strait of
Gibraltar. The main focus was to integrate these phenomena into a numerical configura-
tion that takes into account not only the large-scale features such as the Azores Current
and the meridional density gradient, but also small-scale features such as the entrance of
MW into the Atlantic and river inflow. A thorough characterization of the mean hydrog-
raphy and flow on the shelf/slope was carried out, as well as the connection between the
intermediate circulation (at the MW levels) and the surface layers. The prevalence of the
slope poleward flow throughout the year is also explored.

47



a. Circulation Considerations
The used forcing was the COADS climatology. With this forcing, which contains no

interannual variability or synoptic meteorological scale variability, the purpose was to reach
a realistic circulation as a result of the adjustment of the hydrographic fields. Concerning
this resulting circulation, many of the modeled features have their correspondence in the
available observations.

The main pattern of the circulation consists in a poleward flow along the slope during
winter and lingering on in summer. The IPC has been regarded as a baroclinic current that
results from the isopycnal field adjustment at the upper slope. In addition to this classic
view, Torres and Barton (2006) estimated a mean transport of 2 Sv from the surface down
to 500 m and postulated that the poleward flow could penetrate down to the levels of MW.
The authors hypothesize that a poleward flow at the MW levels would arise from different
dynamical reasons, but can form a continuous flow inducing topographic guidance of the
surface flow. This behavior is well reproduced by the model results, suggesting that the
poleward flow extends downward to the levels of the MW and has a marked barotropic
character.

The winter flow patterns obtained by the SD configuration resemble the typical de-
scription of poleward flow in the literature. The model results also suggest interannual
variability associated with intrinsic variability, that is, not resulting from external forcing.
However, this interannual variability does not explain episodes of strong alongshore current
observed in particular years only (January 1990, 1996, 1998 as reported in Garc??a-Soto et
al., 2002, and Peliz et al., 2005). This means that factors other than climatological forcing
or large-scale forcing, both imposed seasonally but with no interannual variability, may
explain the variability and the years of extreme poleward flow, not described within our
simulations.

When considering the mean fields of hydrographic properties and alongshore velocity
for several years (5 years in this case), we obtain a picture of a poleward flow extending
from the surface down to the levels of the MW, centered at about 10oW, with weak vertical
shear and typical velocities of 6 to 10 cm s?1 for winter and summer, although with some
weakening at the surface in this season (Figure 2.10). This coupling between the MW and
the central water layers was already reported by Maze? et al. (1997). Moreover, observations
of Huthnance et al. (2002) report maximum poleward flow at moorings near 42oN, 9.5oW
in September-October for all depths, a secondary peak in December-January at the upper-
most currentmeter, and a maximum of equatorward flow in February-April. These features
resemble the transport patterns in the central box for section 43oN (Figure 2.11 b). Like-
wise, persistent poleward flow at about 250 m depth at a location near 42.3oN, 10.2oW is
reported by Peliz et al. (2005) based on datasets of the Instituto Espan?ol de Oceanograf??a
(Alonso et al., 1995), where the intensity of the poleward current was about 10 cm s?1 and
no correlation between winds and currents was found at this mooring. This tendency to
poleward flow at this longitude is comparable to the mean values presented in Figure 2.10.

Concerning the issue related with the presence of poleward flow during the upwelling

48



season, Peliz et al. (2002) presented evidences of such behavior for central Portugal. Torres
and Barton (2007) studied the Galician shelf/slope based on hydrography and ADCP mea-
surements and also showed the coexistence of offshore poleward flow during June 1997 at
the starting of the upwelling season. Process studies about the consequences of upwelling-
related flow on poleward currents, such as by Peliz et al. (2003b), show that the poleward
flow does lose intensity and spreads more offshore while keeping its identity. The presence
of poleward flow in summertime is further confirmed by the series of currentmeter moorings
discussed in the review by Relvas et al. (2007). The model results suggest that poleward
flow is present along the slope and coexist with the upwelling-associated flow along the
shelf/upper slope. This is visible not only in the mean alongshore velocities, but also in
the transport associated with the central (slope) box.

A schematic view of the annual circulation at 1000 m (which extends its main features
up to the surface layers), showing the main paths of the mean circulation, is proposed in
Figure 2.17. The MW vein enters through the Cape St Vincent-Gorringe Bank gateway
and flows in the northwestward direction, separating from the southwestern slope of the
Iberian Peninsula (near Cape St Vincent) through an anticyclonic mean vorticity region
(A1). Part of the flow continues poleward along the slope and part recirculates southward
through a cyclonic mean vorticity region (C2) and continues poleward offshore due to the
presence of another anticyclonic structure (A2). Both poleward branches, at the slope and
offshore, give rise to the A3 anticyclonic region north of the Estremadura Promontory, al-
though there is still flow along the slope, contouring the promontory. At the northern flank
of this mean vorticity region, results suggest a new separation: part of the flow returns
toward the coast and continues as the slope poleward flow, which is linked to the Iberian
Poleward Current; the other part circulates poleward in another offshore branch between
11oW and 12oW. The slope poleward flow seems to separate south of 42oN and joins the
offshore branch, exiting afterward the domain south of the Galicia Bank. The slope branch
continues to flow northward along Cape Finisterre, with evidences of a separation at the
northwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.

b. Lagrangian Considerations
This work enabled us to draw a general picture of the origin of upwelled waters on

the Western Iberian Margin and preferential paths according to location, and trace some
relationships between depth of origin and distance traveled by these waters, as well as the
trajectories mean distance to the coast and mean depth.

There is a general tendency for the particles that upwell at the WIM to come from
the north, following the main pathway of the upwelling-associated equatorward jet, mostly
restricted to first 20 km offshore (delimited roughly by the 100-m isobath). From these,
the particles arriving at 60 m are more prone to come from deeper levels than particles
arriving at 20 m. Moreover, the particles that travel the longest distances (up to 500 km
at northern WIM and 400 km at southern WIM) usually originate from the upper 100 m.
Conversely, the particles that travel the least (&lt;100 km) originate from the deepest levels
(up to 500-600 m at GR and EP and 200-300 m at NC and SC). The 20-m particles tend

to come from farther distances than 40-m and 60-m particles. On the other hand, the
particles that have come from deeper levels are the ones whose trajectories, on average,
were always within 20-40 km from the coast, that is, they come from the north and trace
alongshore paths until their upwelling site. Also, there is a tendency for particles in some
of the regions to travel mostly at the depths at which they afterward upwell.

It is also suggested that particles that have origins the farthest away from their upwelling
regions, and hence the shallowest origins and whose trajectories are closest to the coast,
are dependent on the equatorward jet, while particles that originate closer to the coast,
and hence at deeper levels and sometimes from more offshore locations, are modulated by
mesoscale activity.

Chapter 3

Interannual Variability of the
Western Iberian Margin Circulation:
2001-2011

Part of the contents of this chapter have been published by Ramos et al. (2013).

3.1 Overview

After portraying the mean state of the region under scope, hydrographically and dy-
namically, the following chapter focuses on the domain interannual variability. Despite the
system very pronounced seasonal variability, it is also very prone to smaller space scale
phenomena that are responsible for the differences that are observed from one year to
the next. Mesoscale vortices and upwelling-associated filaments are among the dynamical
features responsible for non-linear behavior in this current system. The atmospheric inter-
annual variability is also a key factor in determining years with stronger or weaker summer
upwelling, or the pathways of the poleward flow.

Due to their importance in the maintenance of the associated marine ecosystems, up-
welling regions have been the subject of study for the assessment of significant changes
in the past decades. One of the first important works on this matter is the already men-
tioned work of Bakun (1990), where the four upwelling systems were under scope and,
based on observations for period 1946-1988, the author found that all systems showed an
alongshore wind stress intensification trend during summer, which would implicate an up-
welling intensification. Regarding a more regional scale and for a longer period, Lemos and
Pires (2004) found a weakening trend for the longer 1941-2000 period for western Iberian
Peninsula when analyzing both meridional wind component and SST datasets, although
punctuated by strong interannual variability. The analysis of annual or seasonal signal
tendency may hide different behaviors at the monthly scale. In this light, Alvarez et al.
(2008) confirmed the negative tendency for period 1967-2006 for months March, April and
July to December, but found a positive trend for the remaining months, concluding that

51



there is no clear seasonal trend in upwelling intensity in the past decades. On the other
hand, Santos et al. (2005), based on a shorter satellite-based SST dataset, reported an
upwelling regime shift in the early 1990s to stronger upwelling events, after a positive
maximum of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index, corroborated by stronger
coastal zonal gradients in summer from 1992 onward. Furthermore, Borges et al. (2003)
found a higher frequency in northerly wind occurrence during winter, and consequently an
increase in winter upwelling events. The difficulty to assess trends of upwelling activity
has been summarized recently when Narayan et al. (2010) showed that there can be large
discrepancies when analyzing trends derived from upwelling indicators (wind stress and
SST), since they depend on the dataset used. Recently, Barton et al. (2013), using dif-
ferent wind datasets, found no wind intensification evidence along the Canary Upwelling
System, both off WIM and off northwestern Africa.

This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part makes use of available data
concerning the upwelling index (UI) all along the WIM and consists in a description of
the interannual variability of upwelling from 1967 to 2011, where possible reasons for this
variability are discussed (published in Ramos et al., 2013). The focus of the second part,
on the other hand, is a regional numerical modeling study much like the one carried out in
chapter 2, with the same configurations, but instead of climatologically-forced, and with
the objective of discussing further the interannual variability of this system, the ROMS
run was forced with real winds and fluxes for the period 2001-2011, as detailed below.

3.2 Data and Methodology

3.2.1 Upwelling Index

The upwelling index (UI) is a measure of occurrence of upwelling. There are, in gen-
eral, two ways to compute this quantity, both already used for the WIM: (1) the Ekman
transport perpendicular to the coastline, that is, generated by the alongshore wind stress
component (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2008); (2) the difference between coastal (10-50 km) and
oceanic (? 500 km) SST (e.g. Santos et al., 2005). Both methods have advantages and
caveats and some of these are discussed here. The first method, despite being based on
the known effect of wind stress over the ocean surface and adjacent layers, which is the
main driver of upwelling, does not account for the effects of capes and other coastal fea-
tures, or mesoscale phenomena of which upwelling is also dependent on (Peliz et al., 2002;
Relvas et al., 2009). The second approach is more of a proxy for upwelling occurrence,
since upwelling is not the only cause for offshore-onshore SST differences; SST is strongly
influenced by other phenomena such as river discharge in coastal areas and large-scale
circulation offshore (Go?mez-Gesteira et al., 2008).

In this study, the UI was provided by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO
— http://www.indicedeafloramiento.ieo.es) and was computed by means of geostrophic
winds following the method by Bakun (1973) and adapted later to the Iberian Peninsula
by Lav??n et al. (1991, 2000) (see formulation used by IEO below). The geostrophic

winds were computed from 6-hourly atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP) fields (at a 1o

resolution) obtained from the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography
Center (FNMOC) for the 1967-2011 period. The use of the FNMOC SLP fields to compute
the UI index has been used widely in different studies (e.g. Bograd et al., 2009, and namely
for western Iberia Alvarez et al., 2011, and Mac??as et al., 2012).

Given the almost meridional character of the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula
(Figure 3.1), UI can be formulated solely taking into account the cross-shore component

53



of the Ekman transport:

UI = ?

?swf
(3.1)

where ?y = ?aCD
?
u2 + v2v is the meridional wind stress component (?a ? 1.22 kg m?3

is the air density, CD an adimensional drag coefficient (1.4 × 10?3), u and v are the zonal
and meridional components of the geostrophic wind, respectively, ?sw is the average density
of seawater (? 1025 kg m?3), and f = 2? sin(?) is the Coriolis parameter (? is the angular
velocity of the Earth and ? the latitude). The zonal and meridional components of the
geostrophic wind were computed as follows:

u =

and v =

(3.2)

A friction correction (30% wind speed reduction and 15o wind direction shift) was
applied by the IEO to these geostrophic winds before the upwelling estimate is computed
(Bakun, 1973; Lav??n et al., 1991). The UI was multiplied by a factor of 1000, so that the
measure translates a displacement of volume for each kilometer of coast (m3s?1km?1).

UI is positive when the Ekman transport is oriented offshore (i.e. westward) and thus
upwelling-favorable, and negative when the Ekman transport is onshore (eastward) and
thus downwelling-favorable. The six locations (a-f) at which the UI was computed and
analyzed in this study are shown in Figure 3.1. Throughout the analysis, monthly-averaged
UI indices were sued, computed from the 6-hourly data available at the IEO database.

Ramos et al. (2013) have validated this UI dataset with wind data from a buoy located
at approximately 50 km from the point of Rias Baixas (10oW, 42oN). This buoy has data
since 1999, and the comparison between the two monthly UI time series for summer (April
to September) showed they are significantly correlated (at the 5% level) in all months
except in July.

3.2.2 ROMS Forcing

ROMS two-domain nesting configuration has already been described. Both FD and SD
forcing is the same, but FD was first initialized from rest using monthly temperature and
salinity climatologies from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 at the boundaries (Antonov et al.,
2010; Locarnini et al., 2010), and was forced using monthly surface fluxes from Comprehen-
sive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), similarly to the simulation in chapter 2. This
FD configuration reached equilibrium solutions after four years. At this stage, the Mediter-
ranean Water (MW) is represented using a nudging term. After that period, and once the
ocean reaches equilibrium, realistic forcing at the surface (instead of a climatological one)
was used. The forcing consisted of the NCEP2 air-sea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov) and
QuikSCAT/ASCAT reanalyzed satellite winds from CERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr) for the
period 2001 to 2011, with a spatial resolution of 0.25o (QuikSCAT was replaced by AS-
CAT in 2009). The outputs of FD were used to initialize and provide boundary conditions
for SD through offline nesting. The forcing of SD was the same as for the FD, ensuring

54



consistency for both domains and avoiding problems at the boundaries. For the target
domain, the Mediterranean Undercurrent (MU), previously described, is imposed by the
same boundary inflow/outflow condition at the Strait of Gibraltar as in chapter 2. The
inflow of freshwater to the ocean originated from the main rivers of the region was included
in the form of realistic river outflow (provided by INAG, Water Institute of Portugal), when
available. When there were no registers of river outflow during a given period of time, a
climatological value for seasonal river outflow was imposed.

3.2.3 Satellite and HF-Radar

The SST satellite product is the same as in section 2.2.3, but instead of computing
monthly averages for building a climatology, monthly means for each year for period 2001-
2011 were used, averaged over the entire SD.

Galician SeaSonde HF radar network provides real time surface currents, wave data
and currents forecast information, with a range of up to 200 km offshore. Its operation
and exploitation is the responsibility of Puertos del Estado (www.puertos.es), INTECMAR
(www.intecmar.org) and MeteoGalicia (www.meteogalicia.es). The two radar antennas are
located near Cape Finisterre (42.88oN, 9.27oW) and Cape Silleiro (42.10oN, 8.89oW) (see
Figure 3.1). The hourly data was filtered in order to remove the tides.

3.2.4 Argo Floats

Argo is an international collaboration that collects high-quality temperature and salin-
ity profiles from the upper 2000 m of the ice-free global ocean and currents from interme-
diate depths. The data come from battery-powered autonomous floats that spend most
of their life drifting at depth where they are stabilized by being neutrally buoyant at a
“parking depth” pressure by having a density equal to the ambient pressure and a com-
pressibility that is less than that of sea water. At typically 10-day intervals, the floats
rise to the surface over about 6 hours while measuring temperature and salinity. Satellites
determine the position of the floats when they surface, and receive the data transmitted
by the floats. The float then returns to its original density and sinks to drift until the
cycle is repeated. These data were collected and made freely available by the International
Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it (http://www.argo.ucsd.edu,
http://argo.jcommops.org). The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing Sys-
tem.

3.2.5 EOF Analysis

The spatio-temporal variability of modeled and satellite SST was analyzed by means
of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF). The EOF analysis consists in a representation
of the data in terms of a reduced set of orthogonal functions or modes, whose outputs are
spatial fields and their associated eigenvalues (relative amount of variance) and eigenvec-
tors (temporal weightings for each time step), allowing to study the temporal and spatial

55



variability of data. The EOF eigenvectors and eigenvalues are obtained via singular value
decomposition (SVD) (Preisendorfer, 1988). The contribution of one EOF at any time in
a particular point is obtained by multiplying the value at that location times the value of
the temporal coefficient at a given instant.

That is, a variable is considered to be a function f of space and time, computed for
constant space and time intervals. The EOF method represents the data as a sum of
products of functions:

f(x, y, z) =
?

Fi(x, y) Gi(t) (3.3)

where the Fi express the data distribution in space and the Gi give the contribution of
the respective space distribution to f at any given time.

This methodology can be applied to vectors (e.g. Torres et al., 2003); hence, modeled
and radar surface currents are also compared through EOF analysis.

3.2.6 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Another statistical tool used in this study for the Argo floats data is the root mean
square error (RMSE) (Wilks, 2006), which is a computation of the differences between
model and observations. RMSE is given by:

RMSE =

?
1

n

?
(Mn ? Dn)2 (3.4)

where Mn is the model data, Dn the Argo floats data and n the size of both data series
and the number of times the comparison is carried out.

3.3 Results Overview

The first part of the results (section 3.4) consists in an analysis of a long upwelling index
dataset (1967-2011), already used in the literature (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2008). The purpose
of this analysis is to set a background of variability for the model essay in the second part
(section 3.5), which is more limited in time (2001-2011). The longer dataset provides a
broader look on the interannual variability, namely of upwelling conditions, whereas the
model shorter period is intended for trying to identify more specific episodes of variability,
which is enabled by the numerical tools.

3.4 Upwelling Index Analysis

The UI mean seasonal and interannual distribution for each location is shown in Fig-
ure 3.2. It is evident that the strongest upwelling signal takes place between April and
September, i.e. corresponding to the late spring/summer months, as expected from the
well-known behavior of mid-latitude upwelling systems, and in particularly the Iberian

Upwelling System (Wooster et al., 1976; Fiu?za, 1983). Also noteworthy is the similarity
between locations of the UI patterns given by the Hovmo?ller diagrams (left column), al-
though they vary in magnitude. In general, years with early upwelling onset are followed
by years with late upwelling onset, seen by the left-to-right slope of the contours in the
diagrams. There are some years that register favorable upwelling conditions during winter
(February-March), and these are usually the years where the upwelling season lingers on
until October (1973, 1983, 1992, 2000, among others). For instances, 2007 was a year with
a particularly long upwelling season, which lasted from mid-February to mid-November;
however, UI rarely surpassed the magnitudes that characterize strong upwelling events
(&gt;600 m3s?1km?1). This happens in general for the years of long upwelling seasons, such
as the ones mentioned before. Curiously, strong El Nin?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pos-
itive events have been registered in the preceding years (1972, 1982 and 1991, according
to the Climate Prediction Center of NOAA). ENSO has been known to influence the NW
African upwelling region, where warm ENSO events lead to weaker northerly winds and
therefore weaker upwelling (Roy and Reason, 2001).

As for years of strong downwelling conditions in winter, one can note the periods 1967-
72 and 1977-78, year 1997, and the period 2001-2005. Pe?rez et al. (2010) also registered
low annual mean UI values for these periods in the Rias Baixas location, especially the
latter, which corresponds to a negative summer NAO.

This analysis is reinforced by the seasonal average intensity per region and associated
error bars (which were computed taking into account monthly UI values) displayed on
Figure 3.2, right column. Once again, this seasonal cycle is in agreement with previous
studies on the characterization of upwelling seasonality for the western Iberian region (e.g.
Wooster et al., 1976; Go?mez-Gesteira et al., 2008). In general, UI is positive from March
to September, being strongest in July, and negative from November to February, being
strongest in January. Standard deviations are larger during winter months, decreasing
in summer months, which implies that while in summer (JJA) conditions are always fa-
vorable for upwelling, in winter (as well as some of the transient months) some years are
upwelling-favorable and others downwelling-favorable, although the latter prevail. Rias
Baixas (Figure 3.2 b) presents the lowest positive UI in summer and the highest down-
welling conditions in winter. This can be accounted for by the special characteristics of
northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Torres et al., 2003), where the wind is more variable than
on more southern locations, and the jagged estuaries and closed embayments make the
coastline less linear. As we move southward, upwelling-favorable conditions intensify and
downwelling-favorable weaken. However, it should be noted that the associated errors
vary on the opposite direction, i.e. they tend to decrease when we move southward. In
the southernmost location downwelling conditions in winter are almost non-existing and
positive UI during summer decreases, with values more similar to the northern locations.
From this figure we draw that the preferential period for favorable upwelling conditions is
April to September (AMJJAS), as previously described in the literature (e.g. Fiu?za, 1983).
Therefore, from this point on, results will be analyzed for these months only.

The interannual evolution of the mean summer (April to September) UI since 1967 as a
function of latitude is shown on Figure 3.3. Note that, despite the strong variability present,

58



the color scale is always positive, that is, it is always upwelling-favorable conditions. From
this diagram it is evident that UI has strong interannual variability. The UI signal is highly
consistent for each year within the latitudinal range. That is, whether UI is high or low,
the same is observed at all latitudes. Maximum values are in general observed between
39oN and 40oN. At these latitudes the coastline is less meridional than along the rest of
the Western Iberian Margin due to the presence of the Estremadura Promontory. This
topographic feature may have some influence on the wind direction, usually alongshore.
That is why there is recurrent upwelling-associated filament generation, caused by the
equatorward advection of the cold and fresh upwelled waters that are sometimes enhanced
by the promontory (Haynes et al., 1993; Oliveira et al., 2009). Hence, the UI is recurrently
higher in this area.

There are five years where upwelling occurrence is particularly strong: 1977, 1979,
1991, 1998 and 2002. The 1991 maximum may be related to the early 1990s winter NAO
maximum (Santos et al., 2005), which these authors found to be a turning point toward

59



a period of stronger upwelling occurrence, although such strengthening is not evident in
our results. Peliz et al. (2002) report that in August 1998 western Iberian Peninsula was
under constant northerly winds for practically the entire month, likely accounting for the
strong signal of that year. On the other hand, there are also five years where upwelling
episodes are visibly weak, namely: 1971, 1983, 1985, 1997 and 2003. Nykjaer and Van
Camp (1994) reported a weak upwelling period in the Canary Upwelling System in 1983-
84 due to an exceptional strong El Nin?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean
in the previous year. Furthermore, some of these years show rather an increase of UI with
increasing latitude instead of maxima at 39-40oN (e.g. 1983, 1985, 1999, and 2003).

3.5 Model Results

The following analysis concerns ROMS output from simulations carried out for period
2001-2011. Before presenting the model results, daily series of the meridional wind at two
latitudes are described. Then, model validation and model output analysis is carried out
in parallel or simultaneously. First, Argo floats provide comparison through ?-S diagrams.
Then, EOF analysis is applied to surface currents and SST. The observational surface
currents series comprise one year and a half of data, so this dataset serves only as model
validation. Observational SST, on the other hand, obtained from satellite products, is of
the same length as that of the model simulations; hence, not only they provide a comparison
for the entire study period, but also the SST data is long enough to be valid for analysis.
Temperature anomaly episodes are identified.

Afterwards, model results are explored through salinity and meridional velocity Hovmo?-
ller diagrams, as a function of longitude and of depth, and through meridional transport
series directly compared with wind stress. The meridional transport approach was preferred
to EOF analysis of the surface currents, although it has been performed (not shown), so that
the first hundreds of meters of the water column could be included. These representations
are intended to identify more specifically strong poleward or equatorward events.

3.5.1 Meridional Wind Stress

Figure 3.4 shows daily meridional wind stress for the 11 years under scope, extracted
at two latitudes: 43oN and 37.5oN, centered at 9.7oW (for monthly means see Figure 3.13).
Wind stress off WIM is quite weak when comparing to other eastern boundary systems such
as California, which comprises also an important and strong current system (Di Lorenzo
et al., 2005). For the period 2001-2011 there is no clear tendency of increase or decrease of
meridional wind stress, nor are there dramatic changes in signal or intensity, although the
time series are punctuated by evident interannual variability. From April to September
(and in most years also October), equatorward winds prevail, typical of the upwelling
season and in agreement with the analysis of section 3.3.

The northern latitude registers more markedly poleward wind events, while in the
southern latitude prevails an equatorward signal. In years 2001 and 2002 there are recurrent

poleward episodes in January-March, as well as in 2004 and 2007. For the remaining years,
January seems the month with the most evident northward signal (e.g. 2009, 2010). In
autumn (October-December) this tendency is also frequent (e.g. 2002, 2006, 2009, 2010).

3.5.2 ?-S Distribution

In order to assess the model ability to reproduce hydrography, ?-S diagrams (Figure 3.5)
were plotted for the data of all available Argo floats profiles during the study period,
divided in three regions (Figure 3.5 a). The values of the ENACW, both subpolar and
subtropical branches (gray line and black line in the diagrams, respectively) are reasonably
well reproduced by ROMS, especially their salinity minimum of about 35.6. Likewise, the
deeper, colder waters (&lt;7oC,&amp;lt;35.7) coincide very well with the Argo data. Surface waters,
on the other hand, present some discrepancy in terms of salinity, with ROMS minus Argo
differences from -0.1 in the northern region to -0.3 in the southern region. Note that the
southern region is where there are the fewest Argo floats profile data and the northern
region where there is the most. Model and observations also differ at the MW levels in
about -0.1 to -0.2. Both these differences are also observed in the RMSE of ROMS in
comparison to Argo (Figure 3.5 c), in the upper 100 m and between 1000 and 1400 m
depth. Salinity RMSE reaches 0.2 and 0.25 at these depths, respectively, while throughout
the water column values remain close to 0.1 or lower, and temperature RMSE reaches
1.15 and 1.3, also respectively at those depths, while at the remaining levels values vary
between 0.3 and 0.8. The discrepancy at the MW levels may arise from a displacement of
the maximum temperature and salinity associated with MW. This is consistent with the
climatological observations of chapter 2. While observations place the MW main core at
1200 m, ROMS places it at about 1000 m.

3.5.3 Surface Currents

EOF analysis was applied to model and observational surface currents for period July
2010 to December 2011 (the period of HF-radar data availability); hence, the following
analysis concerns ROMS validation only. Figures 3.6 and 3.7 show the first and the second
modes of vector EOF of daily values of surface velocity, respectively, for ROMS and for
HF-radar data.

The first mode of the real vector EOF represents basically the current meridional com-
ponent. For this domain and time frame, the first mode represents roughly 36% of the
ROMS variability, while it is 56% of the radar variability. Both spatial modes present
south-southwestward vectors (with intensity increasing onshore in ROMS), which means
that, for instances, in the case of northerly winds, surface currents are southward with a
westward deflection (? 45o) due to the wind-induced Ekman dynamics. Conversely, in the
case of southerly wind, the deflection is eastward. The temporal mode for both datasets
agrees well, except for some overestimation of ROMS.

The second EOF mode (Figure 3.7) represents the zonal current component. For
ROMS, 16% of the variability is explained by this mode, whereas for radar the value

is of 18%. The general tendency is for eastward flow, deflected southeastward, reflecting
Ekman drift for a zonal wind. There is still reasonably good agreement between the two
datasets.

Combining the two modes, we obtain the two components of the Ekman transport, and
can thus analyze the preferential direction of the surface flow. When the temporal modes of
both EOFs are positive, the spatial modes result in southward vectors, which occur mostly
in spring and summer and correspond to the upwelling equatorward jet (June-August
2011). In the second EOF temporal mode, there is another striking positive episode in
late October-early November 2010, to which corresponds a weaker and not always positive
signal in the first EOF temporal mode; therefore, the direction of the flow oscillated between
equatorward or offshore. In September-October and December 2010, both temporal modes
are negative, hence indicating poleward flow, also occurring less evidently in March and
November 2011. In December 2011 (and early May, although less prominent), the second
temporal mode indicates a strong positive event, which counterbalanced by a weak signal
in the first temporal mode results in onshore surface flow.

3.5.4 SST

Applying EOF to SST time series, model and satellite, allows not only to evaluate
ROMS performance in reproducing SST variability for the study period, but also to give
a general portrait of that variability.

EOF were computed for monthly anomalies. The seasonal cycle was removed, otherwise
the first mode of variability would be nothing more than SST seasonality. The first mode
(Figure 3.8) explains 57% of the variability for the model and approximately 66% for
the satellite (without removing the seasonal cycle, this mode would explain &gt; 90% of
the variability — not shown). There is a fairly good agreement between model and
observations in the temporal mode, although ROMS tends to overestimate some of the
variability peaks, such as in mid-2003, two episodes in 2006 and one at the end of 2008.
On the other hand, it achieves a good agreement for the episodes of 2002, 2007 and 2011.
The spatial distribution of the first mode shows an offshore gradient, and it is clear that
the strongest variability occurs along the coast within the 200-m isobath, the typical band
of coastal upwelling.

A strong positive signal on the spatial mode multiplied by negative temporal anoma-
lies in summer can mean intense upwelling events. Regarding positive temporal anoma-

lies, for instances the episode of April 2011, they are usually associated with particularly
warm months or, for the summer months, weak upwelling. ROMS spatial mode shows
some prominent signals that extend offshore along 39oN, the location of the Estremadura
Promontory, and 41oN, off Aveiro. In the satellite spatial mode, there is a more general-
ized offshore variability south of 40oN, although there is evidence of protuberances located
at the latitudes not only of the Estremadura Promontory but also of Cape Finisterre and
Cape St Vincent. These signatures may be related to the generation of upwelling-associated
filaments.

From the first mode time series, a few strong upwelling signals stand out, e.g. summer
2002, summer 2007 and autumn 2008. Positive anomalies are more frequent and occur in
all seasons, sometimes in the same year. In summer (mid-year), there are relevant peaks
in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009, which correspond to years of less upwelling-favorable winds
(Figure 3.4). There are also warm anomalies occurring in other seasons, e.g. early 2002
and 2008, and late 2006.

Figure 3.9: EOF second temporal (upper graphic) and spatial (lower maps) modes for the
SST monthly anomalies for period 2001-2011. The black line is ROMS temporal mode and
the gray line is the satellite temporal mode. Isobaths 200 m and 1000 m are shown.

The EOF second mode (Figure 3.9) presents the strongest variability in the north-
western corner of the domain, seen by the negative anomalies in the spatial distribution
of both model and satellite. Conversely, anomalies are positive alongshore WIM within
roughly the 1000-m isobath. Explained variability is of 10% for ROMS and about 8% for
the satellite. The temporal mode shows again some overestimation of variability peaks, for
instances the episodes in 2005-2007 and 2011. Negative values of the time series during
summer (2003, 2005, 2006-2008) are associated with negative temperature anomalies along
the upwelling band, whereas prevailing positive values for e.g. 2009-2011 relate to negative
SST anomalies in the northern region.

In the third variability mode (Figure 3.10), explained variability is of 7% for ROMS
and 5.5% for the satellite. There is a kind of N-S symmetry in the spatial modes; both
ROMS and satellite show negative anomalies along the coast north of 40oN (weaker and
extended offshore for the latter) and positive anomalies at the southern coast (stronger
in the satellite). For the temporal mode, there is again some overestimation of peaks

Figure 3.10: EOF third temporal (upper graphic) and spatial (lower maps) modes for the

by ROMS (2005-2007); however, there are also instances where the reverse is observed:
underestimation of peaks by ROMS (2004, 2010, 2011). In general, the time series seem to
agree better than the 2nd mode. Strong positive anomalies can be found in the temporal
mode for 2005-2007, 2010 and 2011 (summer and summer/autumn), which brings about
negative anomalies along NW Iberian Peninsula and positive anomalies south of Portugal.
Summer negative anomalies around the Galician coast may be associated with filament
generation, which, as stated before, occurs recurrently in this region due to its bathymetric
characteristics (Torres et al., 2003).

3.5.5 Salinity and Meridional Velocity Analysis

From here on the analysis is carried out for ROMS output only. The previous EOF
analysis is in itself a good method for identifying particular events of SST anomalies. In
addition, we computed Hovmo?ller diagrams as a function of longitude and of depth (Figures

68



3.11 and 3.12, respectively), for salinity and meridional velocity, for the entire study period.
Note that the salinity color scales are different between latitudes: the southern location is
displaced by +0.25 relative to the northern one.

At 43oN (Figure 3.11 a), three strong fresh events are observed near-shore and offshore
in early 2001 and 2003, and in late 2006-early 2007, to which correspond poleward velocities
nearshore (Figure 3.11 b) and fresh signals at 37.5oN (Figure 3.11 c). These events are
related to strong river discharge (not shown), advected offshore through Ekman transport.
Fresh water signals nearshore in the beginning of 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011 are most
likely associated with winter river discharges from the Galician Rias, whose fresh waters
usually remain contained within the estuaries. On the other hand, strong episodes of
high salinity are observed in the second halves of 2009-2011, with corresponding poleward
velocities (especially 2009), which denotes saline water advection from the south. Note
that these years presented marked SST positive anomalies (Figure 3.8), which may indicate
poleward flow events. Nearshore, equatorward flow prevails in summer at both latitudes,
and at 43oN there are punctual strong poleward events, usually associated with moderate
high salinity episodes: early and late 2001 (note the very high salinities at 37oN at that
period); mid 2002; mid 2006 (with high salinities more offshore); and early 2008. Some of
these episodes have also correspondence to SST warm anomalies (Figure 3.8).

At 37.5oN (Figure 3.11 c,d), low salinity values have correspondence with evidence of
intense equatorward flow, especially for the summers of 2001 to 2004, and 2007 to 2009.
Note that the latter period was characterized by strong UI (Figure 3.3). High salinities and
poleward velocities occur more frequently along 11oW, mostly in summer, while in winter
both episodes are often registered between 9.5o and 10oW. This may constitute evidence
of offshore displacement of the poleward advection of saline waters during the upwelling
season, that in winter occurs closer to the coast. This is apparent, for instances, from 2007
and 2008, for both variables.

In the vertical profiles (Figure 3.12), it is easier to identify particular saline/fresh and
poleward/equatorward events. At 43oN (Figure 3.12 a,b), the saline events of 2009-2011
are again striking, also with a poleward velocity signature down to 500 m, as well as the
fresh events of early 2001 and 2003, and late 2006-early 2007. There is an episode of
subsurface high salinity and poleward velocity, not evident in Figure 3.11: late 2001-early
2002, which corresponds to a very strong salinity signal at 37.5oN, consistent with S-N
saline water advection. Equatorward strong signals, reaching down to 400-500 m, can be
found in early and mid-2005, the second half of 2008 and mid-2011.

At 37.5oN (Figure 3.12 c,d), salinities above 36 occur at least once a year, mostly cen-
tered in winter, consistent with the observations in Figure 3.11 between 9.5o and 10oW. The
years with strongest poleward events were 2002-2003 (autumn-winter), early 2004, early
and late 2005, and late 2008. Correspondence with the meridional wind stress distribution
is less evident; moreover, the circulation here is more influenced by the Mediterranean
flow at deeper levels (below 500 m). On the other hand, equatorward velocities higher
than 0.1 m s?1 are registered in the first halves of 2006, 2009 and 2011, with weaker ver-
tical signatures. At this latitude, this measurement point (centered at 9.7oW) is farther
from the coast than at 43oN, hence these episodes may not correspond to strong upwelling

events; they could rather be associated with vortex structures as seen in chapter 2. Note
the salinity minima between 300 and 400 m at both latitudes, the signature of ENACW.
Also noteworthy is the barotropic character of the flow, which has also been observed in
chapter 2.

3.5.6 Meridional Transport

Figure 3.13 presents the wind stress meridional component time series for two points
off WIM and the meridional transport integrated from the coast to the upper slope down
to 400 m. In the northern section (Figure 3.13 a), 2001 and 2002 were years with rela-
tively strong southerly wind episodes in autumn-winter, partially in agreement with the
Hovmo?ller diagrams. The strong saline episodes observed in Figures 3.11 and 3.12 in 2009-
2011 have transport correspondence, since for those years it is mostly poleward, but not in
the meridional wind stress, which indicates these poleward flows are not wind-driven. Other
years that have episodes with poleward wind stress &gt; 0.05 N m?2 are March 2003, October
2006, and February 2008, all of which were observed in Figure 3.11 and/or Figure 3.12 in
the velocity profiles. In the remaining years, there is in general equatorward transport in
summer, coincident with average northerly winds. For the three intense fresh water events
(2001, 2003, and 2006-2007), they have correspondence with prevailing poleward winds for
those periods.

At 37.5oN (Figure 3.13 b), both the meridional wind stress and transport time series are
preferentially equatorward. Among the few exceptions are years 2009-2011, the saline and
poleward events of the Hovmo?ller diagrams. Strongest equatorward winds (&gt; 0.1 N m?2)
occur in 2001-2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011, partly consistent with the high UI of Figure 3.3
and the coastal equatorward velocities (and low salinities) seen in Figure 3.11.

3.6 Discussion

a. Upwelling Index
An initial brief study of the intra- and interannual variability of Upwelling Index off

western Iberian Peninsula was performed taking into account six locations (Rias Baixas,
Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, Cabo da Roca, Sines and Sagres — Figure 3.1). The data is
characterized by a strong seasonal cycle and a superimposed strong interannual variability,
in agreement with previous works that have thoroughly described the Iberian Upwelling
System (e.g. Relvas et al., 2007). UI is quite homogeneous along the western coast of the
Iberian Peninsula; strong and weak upwelling signals in different years are observed at all
latitudes, although with different intensities.

These results indicate that large-scale meteorological conditions can explain the largest
fraction of the variability of upwelling processes in the western coast of Iberia. However,
it is evident that mesoscale processes also play a significant role in this variability. It
is suggested that mesoscale processes are rather important in mid-summer, seen by the
significant UI differences from year to year. Hoinka and Castro (2003) observed that July

is usually the month with the highest frequency of thermal low patterns. The question of
the role of mesoscale on upwelling systems has been addressed by previous authors such
as Di Lorenzo et al. (2005) for the California Current System and by Relvas et al. (2009)
for western Iberian Peninsula. The former found, for period 1949-2000, a warming trend
attributed to surface heating and a strengthening of upwelling-favorable winds, which in
turn increase current velocities and associated variance. This extra eddy activity, the
authors postulate, may have implications in the decadal variability of the system. The
latter, considering the different SST trends in the northern and southern coasts of Western
Iberian Peninsula since 1985, attribute the differences to mesoscale activity associated with
upwelling. This difference is higher for the core summer months (JJA).

Taking into consideration studies in the above-cited literature of interannual variability
and upwelling trends, the data presented here does not show any clear increase or decrease
of UI from 1967 to 2011. Figure 3.3 indicates that the 70’s (80’s) were a decade of gener-
ally strong (weak) upwelling events, and that from 1990 on the intensity of UI alternates
roughly every two years. Bakun (1990) observed similar behavior off Iberian Peninsula at
43oN, with general high UI in the 70’s and oscillating UI in the 80’s. Even Narayan et
al. (2010), who have found both strengthening and weakening UI tendencies by analyzing
several yearly-averaged UI time series, observed, for a similar period for a region off NW
Africa, more accentuated UI variability after 1990.

b. Model Results
ROMS showed a good performance in reproducing both the hydrography and the sur-

face dynamics, according to the validation analysis that comprised radar surface currents,
satellite SST and Argo floats temperature and salinity profiles. There are T and S biases
in depth similar to those observed in chapter 2, which arise from the differences in the
depths where the properties of the Mediterranean Water are found rather than from the
inability of ROMS to reproduce them. The interannual variability of SST reflected in the
EOF analysis was well captured, particularly the warm and cold anomaly events given by
the first mode.

From these short time series of either SST, salinity or meridional wind stress there is no
evidence of trends. Longer series are necessary to assess the time scales of that variability.
Ruiz-Villarreal et al. (2008) analyzed SST long time series (1900-2006) for the Galician
coast and found an increase of roughly 0.1oC decade?1; for a shorter period (1967-2006),
the authors report decrease in upwelling-favorable winds in summer. They also trace a
correlation between the variations of the upper layers temperature and salinity and decadal
variability, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In this study, preliminary tests
concerning the NAO did not show any evidence of correlation between that index and
either SST or meridional wind stress times series (including with month lagging).

From the combined analysis of salinity and meridional velocity zonal and vertical pro-
files, together with coastal meridional transport and the meridional wind stress, it was
possible to identify several episodes of saline water northward advection. Years 2009 to
2011 showed SST warm anomalies, and strong salinity and meridional flow signals, as well

74



as some tendency for northward transport, which may indicate that there were episodes
of poleward flow. These events also suggest that salinity has been increasing for the last
ten years, although the time series is not long enough, nor is it possible to validate. Nev-
ertheless, Reboreda et al. (in revision) compared ROMS salinity profiles for period May
2001-April 2002 with data retrieved at two points along 42oN between 9o and 9.5oW, and
found good agreement between results, particularly the salinity event in the beginning of
2002 that is reported here. Moreover, Amorim et al. (2012) reported high salinities for
summer 2010 and 2011 from measurements carried out off Aveiro, at about 41oN.

Other high salinity and poleward flow events have correspondence in the literature:
Otero et al. (2008) registered strong poleward currents measured by a buoy at approxi-
mately (42oN, 9.4oW) in November and December 2002; Gago et al. (2011) registered an
episode of temperatures above 18oC at the surface on the second half of 2002, and gen-
eralized high salinities throughout 2006 in the upper 100 m. Furthermore, Le Cann and
Serpette (2009) observed evidences of strong poleward flow in late 2006 and early 2007 in
the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, with surface temperatures of 17oC, which is
consistent with the EOF SST anomalies, although not with the salinity and meridional
flow profiles.

In the previous chapter it became evident that the poleward flow is likely a permanent
feature of the WIM circulation system, co-existing with upwelling during summer, which
means that it is not driven solely by wind stress, although it can be strengthened by intense
poleward events. The notion that poleward flow shifts offshore during the upwelling season
was further suggested by these results, particularly from Figure 3.11.

In what concerns upwelling events, there is relatively good agreement between the
vertical Hovmo?ller diagrams (Figure 3.12), the UI time series (Figure 3.3) and in the
monthly-averaged wind stress (Figure 3.13). This is expectable, since UI is computed from
wind stress, and upwelling is strongly dependent on wind. Furthermore, ROMS was able
to reproduce the strong fresh water input of particularly intense river discharge events in
2001, 2003 and 2006-2007.

Chapter 4

Model-derived Connectivity Patterns
along the Western Iberian Margin: a
Lagrangian Approach

4.1 Overview

The study of larval connectivity allows for a better understanding of marine species dy-
namics, in particular in such coastal ecosystems as the WIM. Coastal ocean processes play
a fundamental role in the life cycle of numerous marine species, from crustaceans to small
pelagic fish. Hence, it is important to understand how their variability and/or long-term
changes affect(s) and/or bound(s) the development and survival of larvae. Larval dispersal
is crucial in the life cycle of these species, since it dictates the supply of larvae from one
location to the next, the ability of retention of a given location, and even the mortality and
the migration success. Understanding these patterns is also important in terms of coastal
management and biodiversity conservation measures. Among the factors that contribute
for the offshore transport of larvae are upwelling filaments and other mesoscale phenomena,
the upwelling front itself, the dynamics of the WIBP and species-specific larval behavior
(Nolasco et al., 2013b).

Larval dispersal and supply may be quantified to a certain degree through connectivity.
Connectivity of marine populations consists in assessing the connection between spawning
locations and settlement locations, the traveling distance for settlement and the fraction
of settled larvae at given locations (Kim and Barth, 2011). This successful settlement of
larvae is called recruitment, which usually means that when larvae arrive at a given location
conditions are prone for that larvae to develop and reach the adult stage (Domingues et
al., 2011).

Numerical models have helped to overcome the inherent difficulties of monitoring such
complex dynamics, in particular Lagrangian models coupled to regional ocean configu-
rations (Marta-Almeida et al., 2006; Peliz et al., 2007). Taking advantage of this work
high-resolution domain configuration for the WIM, this chapter comprises an effort to

77



study these different quantities (supply, accumulation, connectivity) for this region, fol-
lowing the work of Nolasco et al. (2013b). While these authors performed a study focused
on a specific species, and where the larvae supply locations were set at the main estu-
aries along the WIM, this approach is more generic in the sense that larvae are treated
more as Lagrangian particles, and recruitment is allowed to occur at any location along
the WIM, not only in estuaries. Two simulations were carried out: one with no imposed
vertical migration or travel distance limitations, either horizontal or in depth, much like
the Lagrangian application in section 2.6; the other where particles have diel vertical mo-
tion (DVM), that is, they migrate down to 60 m during the day, for protection against
predators, and up to the surface/subsurface during the night, for feeding (Santos et al.,
2008). In this light, for the case of DVM, larvae are restricted to the upper 60 m.

Hence, this chapter describes connectivity along the WIM of generic larvae for adjacent
locations with equal areas. This is carried out numerically for years 2001 to 2011, that is,
the Lagrangian model runs over the ROMS simulations forced by real data for that period,
described in chapter 3. The purpose of this application is not only to assess the influence
of vertical displacement on dispersal distances and accumulation rates, but also to relate
the patterns of dispersal/accumulation and connectivity with strong/weak wind episodes
and upwelling events, the presence of topographic or bathymetric features, estuaries, etc.

4.2 Data and Methodology

As previously mentioned, the adopted methodology is built from that of Nolasco et al.
(2013b), whose approach was already validated in the work of Domingues et al. (2012).
However, mortality and growth rates dependent on temperature and salinity were not taken
into account, since they are specific of specific species. Recruitment is assumed to occur
when a larva enters one of the defined areas, which means that conditions such as the
larval stage or other information that may influence successful settlement of larvae are not
considered.

4.2.1 ROMS Configuration

The ROMS configuration used for this study is the same as in chapter 3, described in
section 3.2.2. The real forcing for period 2001-2011 was retrieved from the NCEP2 air-
sea fluxes (www.ncep.noaa.gov) and QuikSCAT/ASCAT reanalysis satellite winds from
CERSAT (cersat.ifremer.fr). Boundary conditions were provided by the World Ocean
Atlas (Antonov et al., 2010; Locarnini et al., 2010).

4.2.2 Lagrangian Model

The Lagrangian model, IBM (Individual Based Model), used in this chapter is the same
as the one used in section 2.6, and is described therein (subsection 2.6.1). However, while
in section 2.6 IBM ran over ROMS climatological run (described throughout chapter 2),

78



here it runs over the ROMS simulation forced by realistic winds, which period spans from
2001 to 2011, as described in chapter 3.

Figure 4.1: SD and larvae deployment areas. Some of the major topography features and
rivers are indicated. Isobaths 200 m and 2000 m are shown in black and 1000 m in gray.
Green stars indicate wind stress measurement points of Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.1 shows the 89 areas where the Lagrangian particles simulating larvae are
measured, in terms of supply sources and sinks (the term “source” and “sink” will be
properly defined in the following subsection). Some prominent regions of the WIM (capes,

79



estuaries, . . . ) are indicated for an easier identification when interpreting. Each area is
defined taking 5 grid points cross-shore, seaward from the land mask, and 4 grid points
alongshore, which means that each area is approximately 15 km × 12 km. This area
corresponds approximately to the area of influence of a typical river plume (Nolasco et
al., 2013b). For computational viability, and each area having 4 alongshore points by
5 offshore points, larvae emission is done in only 2 out of each 4 sets of 5 points, which
means 10 out of 20 grid points. Recruitment, on the other hand, is measured in the total
area. Deployment is done at 3 different levels — 3 m, 5 m and 7 m — every 5 days
during 3 months: February, March and April, which is the beginning of larval season for
many marine species, and before the beginning of the upwelling season. Trajectories are
registered every 3 hours for 40 days; however, the analysis is carried out after 30 days of
travel, that is, for the last 10 days of the trajectory. Thirty is the typical number of days
that takes some marine species (e.g. shore crabs) to reach the next stage of development,
and after which they are known to recruit (Domingues et al., 2011). This means that, for
instances, for the particles that are deployed March 31, their source/sink capabilities are
analyzed for the first 10 days of May. The total number of particles deployed is 89 areas
× 10 grid points × 3 levels × 19 time steps = 50,730.

Although these areas are defined west of 6.5oW, which means that there is also emis-
sion/retention at part of the northern and southern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula (see
Figure 4.1), the analysis carried out in terms of supply from source and to sink in the
following section concerns the western coast only. The reason for this is that the focus of
this work is the WIM alone. On the other hand, the WIM cannot be looked at in terms
of departure and arrival of particles without taking into account these neighboring areas,
as if it were detached completely. Thus, the northern and southern coasts are allowed to
supply and to recruit larvae; they are merely not computed when quantifying for the WIM.
Furthermore, Nolasco et al. (2013b) estimated that the contribution of larvae supplying
outside the domain to the north and south through the eastern boundaries is negligible,
as should be the contribution of larvae supplying at the WIM with origin at the same
boundaries. This is valid for the entire set of analyses except for the connectivity matrix,
described below.

4.2.4 Data Analysis

In order to describe the dispersal and connectivity process, some concepts related to
dispersal and accumulation of larvae must be introduced. Dispersal kernel, dispersal from
source or supply from source refers to the process of transport of larvae away from each
defined area along the coast. Conversely, accumulation kernel, accumulation to sink or
supply to sink refers to the process of transport of larvae recruiting into an area.

Dispersal/accumulation kernels convey the frequency distribution of distances of disper-
sal/accumulation. Idealistically (homogeneous ocean, linear coast, symmetrical currents,
. . . ), dispersal kernels would obey the Gaussian distribution, supplying the most to or from
near itself or adjacent locations, and this supply decreasing as the distances increase. An-
other way to measure supply to and from a location is to represent the percentage of larvae

80



recruited as a function of distance between sources/sinks. In this study, source and sink
are operational terms that designate whether an area is “emitting” or “receiving” larvae,
and competent larvae refers to larvae that successfully recruit into any area.

In the present study, one of the aims was to study the inter-annual and spatial patterns
of connectivity. To this end, square connectivity matrices were computed. A connectivity
matrix is defined as the probability matrix of exchange of individuals between sites (Cowen
et al., 2006). These matrices describe the annual accumulated supply of competent larvae
from source area i (i = 1 to k) to sink area j (j = 1 to l):

Cy =

?

?
?

C1,1 · · · C1,l
...

...
...

Ck,1 · · · Ck,l

?

?
? (4.1)

In matrices Cy, each element was normalized by the total number of larvae that orig-
inated from all areas. These matrices formed the basis to calculate a series of descriptors
of the dispersal and connectivity processes.

Annual supply from each source area was defined as the number of larvae originating
in that area that successfully recruited into any area, normalized by the total number of
larvae deployed. This was calculated as the sum of the respective i line of matrix Cy:

Ssource(yi) =
l?

j=1

Ci,j (4.2)

Similarly, annual supply to each sink area was defined as the number of larvae that
recruit into that area independently of the source area, also normalized by the total number
of larvae deployed, and calculated as the sum of the respective j column of matrix Cy:

Ssink(yj) =
k?

i=1

Ci,j (4.3)

Additionally, net supply to each area was computed as the difference between supply
from and supply to that area:

Netsupply(yi) = Ssource(yi) ? Ssink(yi) (4.4)

Positive values of net supply for position yi mean that yi is predominantly a source (it
supplies more than it recruits), and for negative values yi is a better sink (it recruits more
than it supplies).

The dispersal kernels describe particle dispersal as the probability density function
[P(x)] of the number of particles that recruit as a function of distance from the source.
They were standardized by dividing each element by the total number of larvae that were
produced by that area and that recruited subsequently. This resulted in an annual dispersal
kernel for each source area centered on 0 km and describing the probabilities of supply for
the other equally spaced areas. Finally, the ensemble of source areas was averaged in order

81



to obtain annual coast-wide dispersal kernels. Since flow along the coast is not stationary,
leading to non-uniform dispersal along the coast, and because each area receives larvae
from multiple sources, it was also interesting to describe the dispersal distances travelled
by larvae that were supplied to each population. Therefore, accumulation kernels were also
calculated as the distribution of these dispersal distances, in a similar way to the dispersal
kernels but standardizing by dividing each element of the kernel by the total number of
larvae that recruited into that area.

In the above calculations, distances travelled northward were always defined as positive
distances, and distances travelled southward as negative distances. Connectivity matrices,
dispersal and accumulation kernels and supply from source and to sink areas were calculated
for the 11-year period by averaging the annual values.

4.3 Results

4.3.1 Wind Stress Patterns

Figure 4.2 presents the wind stress meridional component for all years under scope at
three points off WIM (43oN, 40oN and 37.5oN, at longitude 9.7oW, marked in Figure 4.1),
for the months where larvae is deployed and/or supply is computed — February to June.
The average of all years is also shown.

Besides the evident interannual variability, it is interesting to remark that depending
on the latitude, meridional wind episodes are different, especially in what concerns point
40oN in comparison with the other two. For instances, in 2004 there is a positive peak in
early April that is much stronger at 40oN; the same occurs for a negative peak in early
March 2008. On the other hand, in 2011, in late February there is a positive maximum
at 40oN, whereas for the other latitudes the meridional wind stress is negative and not
particularly strong. Another noteworthy aspect is the fact that in June there are not
well-defined equatorward winds yet, although they are in general negative.

In general, equatorward winds prevail over poleward winds; however, the more spo-
radic poleward events tend to be stronger than the recurrent equatorward patterns. The
strongest poleward episodes occur usually in February (2001-2003, 2007, 2010, 2011), but
may also occur in March and April (2001, 2003, 2004-2006). The years with less relevant
poleward peaks are 2008 and 2009. Important equatorward episodes can occur roughly in
every considered month, depending on the year.

4.3.2 Dispersal and Accumulation Kernels

Figures 4.3 and 4.4 present dispersal and accumulation kernels (annual averages), for
both runs (with and without DVM). For the dispersal kernels, positive distances mean
supply to the north, and for the accumulation kernels positive distances mean supply from
the south. That is, the south-north direction is always positive. Furthermore, the sink
distributions are very similar to those of the source, as it should be, since if in average a

source supplies, for instances, to a northern (southern) location 10 km away, it is supplied in
average from a southern (northern) location 10 km away. The strong interannual variability
is striking.

In some years supply is done mostly to the south (2002, 2004, 2009, and also 2006 and
2007, discussed further below) and from short distances, and we see that 2009 was a year
where winds were predominantly equatorward and with few strong episodes (Figure 4.2 i),
consistent with short displacements. In other years, particles travel longer distances (2001,
2008, 2010). In these years there are long periods of consistent winds: in 2001, after
a month and a half of strong poleward winds, equatorward winds prevail between April
and June, hence the long distances travelled in both directions; in 2008, there are rarely
poleward episodes, thus promoting generalized southward transport; in 2010, there are
mostly poleward winds, at least at 43oN and 40oN, accounting for the marked northward
dispersal.

The cases of 2006 and 2007 are quite interesting, with an abrupt change at distance zero.
Observing the dispersal (accumulation) kernels — Figure 4.3 f,g (Figure 4.4 f,g) — , on one
hand there is a higher supply to the south (from the north) at shorter distances, and on the
other supply to the north (from the south), although lower, reaches farther locations. In
terms of winds (Figure 4.2 f,g), 2006 has an important poleward episode in March, while
in 2007 several poleward peaks take place throughout February, promoting northward
transport, both followed by consistent equatorward winds, lasting several months, which
explains the large distribution to the south (from the north).

The most evident difference between distributions with and without DVM is the shift
toward supply to the south (from the north). This shift is visible in almost all years, clearly
in 2004, 2007 and 2009, but also in 2003, 2005 and 2011, where the protuberance toward
supplies to the north (from the south) are softened and the distribution becomes more
symmetric around zero. The shift is also visible from the mean and standard deviation of
the distributions (indicated in black and red at each side of the plot).

In the end, the mean distribution is mostly symmetrical (Figure 4.3, 4.4 last subplot),
with a central peak that suggests self-recruitment (or in adjacent areas) and an exponential
decrease toward farther distances. Nolasco et al. (2013b) results were more consistent with
this kind of distribution for each year, which means that there was higher self-recruitment
and that populations tended to supply to/from adjacent locations. Furthermore, the im-
position of DVM does not mean higher self-recruitment as could be expected, since the
vertical migration of larvae could inhibit advection offshore and promote retention near
their origin.

4.3.3 Supply from Source and to Sink

Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show the total annual supply from each source and to each sink,
respectively (the last subplot is the 11-year mean), for DVM and no DVM simulations.
There is some interannual variability, but overall all areas are able to supply. However,
it seems that Tejo and Sado are systematically the “worst” sources, particularly seen in
years 2007 to 2009. Note that the extremities of the western Iberian coast are also weak

sources. In the case of DVM, the supply increases throughout, especially north of Peniche.
With the introduction of vertical migration, particles spend more time below the surface
Ekman layer, avoiding offshore dispersion during upwelling, and thus improving the ability
of successful recruitment.

In what concerns supply to sinks, there are more marked differences between locations.
The areas that seem to retain more are Peniche, Tejo, and Sado, and once again the
extremities of the western Iberian coast. The reason for these regions to be good sinks
may be the fact that they are all located adjacent to capes or promontories, which may
enable them to retain arriving particles. On the other hand, they were observed to be
weak sources, likely due to the same reason. In the case of DVM, the tendency for good
retention is enhanced, particularly near pronounced topography features.

Figure 4.7 shows the balance between supply to and from each location. Positive
values mean that supply is greater than accumulation and negative values mean that
accumulation is greater than supply. Therefore, zero balance does not usually mean that
there is neither supply nor accumulation; rather that supply is equal to accumulation. The
general tendency indicates that the areas between capes Finisterre and Corrubedo (the
northernmost regions, see Figure 4.1) are good sinks, whereas the northwest from ria da
Arousa to north of the Estremadura Promontory (that is, where the coastline is mostly
meridional), holds the best sources. Between Peniche and Tejo there is also a tendency
for more supplying than accumulation (the coastline is again mostly meridional), but at
Tejo and Sado there is preferentially accumulation, as previously seen. South of Sado
there is again more tendency for supplying, with the exception of the two southernmost
locations near Cape St Vincent. Therefore, we conclude that there are better conditions
for larvae sources in regions where the coastline is smoother and straight, and better
conditions for larvae sinks where the coastline is more jagged and protuberant. Once
again, the introduction of vertical displacement of larvae tends to enhance both supply
and accumulation. The locations where the differences between DVM and no DVM are
the extremities: north of ria de Arousa and south of Mira.

It is interesting to remark that Nolasco et al. (2013b) found that for instances Aveiro
was a good sink and a weak source, conversely to these results. However, since in that
study the locations for recruitment were limited to the estuaries, a possible explanation for
this difference is the fact that in order for Aveiro to successfully supply southward was if
that recruitment were done in Mondego or Tejo, with no sink in between, over the 150 km
that separate these two locations. In this approach, Aveiro can supply to much closer
locations, becoming a more successful source than sink.

4.3.4 Dispersal Distances

Figure 4.8 (4.9) presents the dispersal distance of particles supplied to (from) each
area according to the alongshore location of all areas when functioning as sources (sinks).
In Figure 4.8, positive (negative) distances indicate particles being supplied to the north
(south), while in Figure 4.9 positive (negative) distances mean that particles are being
supplied from the south (north). Figure 4.10 is a source/sink balance where the average

is computed in time. The last subplot is the 11-year mean. In all these figures, there is a
crucial area for change in behavior, which is the region between Peniche and Tejo (between
approximately 630 and 730 km in terms of alongshore position of source/sink) — the
Estremadura Promontory (EP).

Like in the supply analysis, dispersal distance undergoes strong interannual variability.
Analyzing the case with no DVM, in terms of source location (Figure 4.8), there are
several years where north of Peniche/Tejo particles are supplied to the north, and south of
Peniche/Tejo they are supplied to the south (2001, 2003, 2010, and less evidently in 2006
and 2007), and this is reflected on the 11-year mean, while in other years it is not so clear.
In some years, the particle dispersal is mostly southward (2004, with the exception of Tejo
and Sado, 2008 and 2009, also visible in 2002, but very close to zero, with the exception
of the EP region); in others it is preferentially northward (2005, 2011). In 2005, however,
dispersal distances are near zero, except in the EP, while in 2011 distances to the north
down to Aveiro are positive, near zero from Aveiro to Sado, and positive again to the south,
although much weaker. As suggested in the previous figures, DVM enhances supply to the
south in the region north of Peniche (e.g. 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007), as seen in the average
(last subplot). In the southern WIM differences between DVM and no DVM are negligible.
A possible explanation for this follows. DVM increases southward recruitment in general.
North of Peniche, since recruitment was carried out preferentially northward, the difference
is more evident than south of Peniche, where recruitment was already preferentially to the
south.

When observing dispersal distances according to the sink (Figure 4.9), there is more
agreement interannually, and also between the cases with and without DVM: particles are
supplied from the south in northern WIM and from the north in southern WIM. Here,
the transition between supply origin (the geographical gap) is north of the Estremadura
Promontory, between Mondego and Peniche (and sometimes even farther north). The more
evident exceptions are years 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009, where the particles retained were
supplied mostly from the north. However, in average (last subplot), tendencies are for
positive retention north of Aveiro, negative retention south of Aveiro, and close to zero
south of Sado. Differences between the cases with and without DVM are not significant
because, although dispersal distances are greater, they increase in both directions, and so
the balance remains similar to the case without DVM (only slightly enhanced southward,
as expected). Since there are few larvae supplied from south of Tejo that go northward,
the regions between Aveiro and Tejo are not much supplied from the south. Even in years
where particle dispersal is mostly northward, there is a decrease between Peniche and Tejo.

As previously observed in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, the existence of DVM enhances southward
transport. From these figures it can be drawn that this happens mostly north of the EP.
The EP is an evident geographical obstacle for larvae transport. It is interesting to note
that, from the source point of view, the gap takes place between Peniche and Tejo, whereas
from the sink point of view it occurs between Mondego and Peniche. That is, generally
speaking, for years where dispersal occurs on opposite directions relative to the EP, supply
north of Peniche (north of Mondego) is carried out to the north (from the south), and
vice-versa. When introducing DVM, supply is carried out farther to the south in northern

distribution to the case of DVM.

WIM (Figure 4.8) because there is less offshore advection due to Ekman transport. On
the other hand, supply is carried out from farther north all along the WIM.

Taking in consideration the dispersal distance averaged in time (Figure 4.10), its analy-
sis is less evident because positive (negative) values may indicate either supply to the north
(south) or supply from the south (north). But it is interesting to remark the interannual
variability. To years with marked poleward events early in the period of supply, such as
2001, 2005, 2007 and 2010 (see Figure 4.2), correspond preferential northward dispersal
during February and sometimes mid-March. In average (last subplot) the balance is prac-
tically zero, with southward tendency from April on for the case with no DVM and from
March on in the case of DVM. Note that the time period is relative to the deployment
of larvae, and not the analysis period (after 30 days, and for 10 days), which means that
the larvae supplied in April were recruited already during the upwelling season. The DVM
case shows more clearly southward dispersal prevailing over northward dispersal.

4.3.5 Connectivity Matrix

Figures 4.11 and 4.12 present the connectivity matrices for the case without and with
DVM, respectively, for the all the areas along the WIM, including the ones located in the
northern and southern coasts. Each line of the matrix represents the distribution of larvae
originating from each area (y-axis) that successfully recruit to the different areas along the
coast (x-axis). That is, following the diagonal, which means self-recruitment, the upper
triangular matrix indicates where areas are supplied from the north (equartorward disper-
sal), and the lower triangular matrix where they are supplied from the south (poleward
dispersal).

With respect to the case of no DVM, the most striking differences in relation to the
connectivity matrix of Nolasco et al. (2013b) are less accumulation, seen by the differences
in the order of magnitude (colorbar), and less self-recruitment. To the north of Douro,
supply is carried out mostly from the south, most evident for Finisterre. Between Douro
and Peniche, particles are supplied preferentially from the north, recruiting larvae from
almost as far as Arousa. Furthermore, we observe again a gap in the Tejo-Sado region:
larvae originated here do not travel north, and between Peniche and Tejo supply is carried
out strictly from the north (mostly south of Aveiro). This was also observed by Nolasco et
al. (2013b). Between Sado and Cape St Vincent, recruitment is done in both directions,
although Cape St Vincent is strongly supplied by the region south of Mira.

In what concerns the case of DVM, the diagonal band is wider, indicating larger disper-
sal, and general higher recruitment, seen by the lighter blues. Higher recruitment, whether
supply is done northward or southward, is enabled by the fact that larvae, is less advected
offshore in case of northerly winds and less retained onshore in case of southerly winds,
allowing the particles to travel longer distances. Also, there is higher dispersal to the
south, seen by the displacement of the diagonal band toward the “upper” triangle; hence,
there is a tendency for recruitment to happen in the N-S direction. This is consistent
with the analysis of the dispersal/accumulation kernels (Figures 4.3 and 4.4), where the
same southward displacement was observed. The difference is more evident between Douro

and Peniche, where the colors are more vivid, which was also made clear in the dispersal
distance plots (Figures 4.8 and 4.9).

4.4 Discussion

This chapter consists in an idealized study where Lagrangian particles deployed in
equally spaced and equally sized areas serve as means to infer about a generic type of larvae
and to allow tracing average behaviors such as supply, accumulation and connectivity. This
Lagrangian study is applied to the interannual ROMS run described in chapter 3.

An experiment including diel vertical migration are analyzed in parallel with the ones
in the absence of DVM in order to assess the differences between both. Indeed, low ac-
cumulation is a consequence of the absence of vertical migration. By not allowing the
particles to descend periodically in the water column, they remain in the surface Ekman
layer and are thus constantly transported offshore in the presence of upweeling and away
from their origin, contributing to lower probability of recruitment.

Figure 4.12: Connectivity matrix with DVM.

One of the major factors influencing these processes and patterns is wind stress, and
particularly meridional wind stress, which, as seen throughout this work in the previous
chapters, regulates the upper level circulation off WIM in the shelf region. During the
months that were taken into account, which are mainly winter and spring, winds are
very variable, with some years witnessing strong poleward episodes, especially in February
(2001, 2002, 2007, 2010), and a few equatorward and generally weaker episodes, occurring
most frequently in April (2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011), although equatorward winds
exist every year.

In spite of the fact that particles should preferentially supply to and be supplied from
closer areas, the dispersal and accumulation kernels (Figures 4.3 and 4.4) show that this is
not necessarily the case and that it varies greatly from year to year. Equatorward winds
prevail from April to June, although punctuated by poleward episodes. Long periods of
equatorward winds and particularly strong poleward episodes occurring for at least a month
originate dispersal/accumulation at great distances. The years with fewer poleward events
seem to be the ones where supply is carried out in both directions.

The supply from source and to sink images reveal that the ability to supply to or ac-

97



cumulate depend strongly on topography. The WIM northern extremity areas are poor
sources but good sinks, likely due to the Galician Rias embayments and jagged coastline
that are prone for the retention of particles. Tejo and Sado, being located directly south of
the Estremadura Promontory, are observed to be poor sources, although with good abilities
to retain, alongside Peniche, which is located between two capes. And the WIM southern
extremity, the southwest-oriented Cape St Vincent, presents tendency to accumulation.
The best sources are located in the areas with the smoothest coastlines, promoting along-
shore transport of the particles. The connectivity matrices also confirm the Estremadura
Promontory as an obstacle for the supply from the south, in both simulations.

The absence of vertical migration promotes larger advection, as seen in Figures 4.8-
4.10. On the other hand, self-recruitment does not greatly increase when introducing
DVM. Hence, it must be due to the continuous distribution of sources and sinks along the
coast, instead of just taking into account the major estuaries as in the work of Nolasco
et al. (2013b). Furthermore, those authors report, for instances, Aveiro and Mondego as
good sinks, which is not the case in the present study; rather the reverse. The difference
must be attributed to the evenly distributed areas alongshore that makes it easier for the
supply to be done farther away rather than in its point of origin. In their work, there were
no areas of recruitment between Aveiro and Mondego, hence larvae would either disperse
or return to their own estuary; here, they can easily be recruited into adjacent areas that
are only 12 km apart.

There is another striking difference between the cases with and without DVM: in the
former, supply increases significantly, especially in the southern locations, which is a di-
rect consequence of the particles not being subject to offshore advection associated with
Ekman transport in the presence of equatorward winds. An increase in retention is also
evident when observing the connectivity matrices with and without DVM, and although
self-recruitment does not clearly increase, retention between adjacent areas is more notice-
able.

Chapter 5

A Future Climate Scenario, part 1:
Global Climate Models as forcing for
regional ocean modeling

Part of the contents of this chapter have been submitted to Climate Dynamics (Cordeiro
Pires et al., in review).

5.1 Overview

Global climate models (GCMs) have been one of the most important tools of the past
three decades for studying climate, whether past variability or future scenarios in the con-
text of global change. The increasing need for realistic assessments of climate change from a
policymaker and social-economical point of view calls for the minimization of uncertainties,
not only of the models themselves but also of the future scenarios the climate simulations
are based on.

The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) has played a major role in
providing a large database of state-of-the-art GCM simulations from numerous research
institutes around the world, open to the scientific community, comprising not only past
simulations but also simulations forced by scenarios of future climate (Nakic?enovic? et al.,
2000). Consequently, several multi-model inter-comparison studies were carried out (e.g.
Collins et al., 2006; Fyfe et al., 2010; Lorenzo et al., 2011) to assess the models ability to
simulate a given phenomenon or variable, and allow the conjugation of different models
in a specific study. The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) was created
with this intent (Lambert and Boer, 2001), making it possible to evaluate the strengths
and weaknesses of the GCMs. A way to minimize the individual model biases is to use
the multi-model ensemble mean, that is, the combination of output from different models
(Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007). This approach has been increasingly considered the most
suitable in climate projections because, assuming that simulation errors in different GCMs
are independent, the mean of all the models can be expected to present lower uncertainties

99



than each model individually (Lambert and Boer, 2001). Compared against historical
observed gridded data, the ensemble mean shows good results in replicating historical
climate, from which we can infer that it is also a valid approach in the representation of
future climate conditions (Ra?isa?nen and Palmer, 2001). Pierce et al. (2009) and Annan
and Hargreaves (2010) carried out statistical analyses of the CMIP3 model set and showed
that, in general, the best results are obtained with the multi-model ensemble of a selection
of models.

The atmospheric regimes simulated by GCMs have been thoroughly explored. With
respect to ocean studies based on atmosphere-ocean coupled GCMs (CGCMs), there are
several underlying difficulties: (a) there are by far fewer observation data than for the
atmosphere, rendering model validation more difficult; (b) the air-sea interactions and
feedbacks are strongly non-linear and therefore more difficult to predict and simulate; (c)
CGCMs, especially in deeper layers, usually fail to properly represent the ocean mean state
due to their coarse resolution (Russell et al., 2005); (d) assessments of future global ocean
regimes, which must take into account the ocean distinct time of response and the role of
mesoscale phenomena, have limited reliability. Ocean modeling studies where one or several
CGCMs of the CMIP database have been used include that of Stouffer et al. (2006) to
study the thermohaline circulation variability and that of Karnauskas et al. (2009) where
sea surface temperature tendencies were focused on. However, to date, there have been no
studies with the purpose of assessing if these global climate models were able to properly
represent the mean hydrography of the ocean, whether global or regional, and which ones
were more accurate.

Due to their seasonality nature, upwelling systems are very sensitive to climate change
(Holt et al., 2010). It is of high interest to try to assess the impacts of climate change on the
hydrography and circulation of these areas, because such changes may have consequences
on the respective ecosystem (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). In order to do so, one needs
an ocean model with a good horizontal and vertical resolution, and reliable atmospheric
conditions to use as forcing. In what concerns the latter, with the IPCC future scenarios
and the several CGCM simulations at our disposal, if we are able to obtain good results
regarding the present climate, we can postulate that the same configuration and forcing
must be reasonable for applying climate scenarios. One of the most recent works under
this scope and for this region is that of Miranda et al. (2012), who used a regional climate
model to force a ROMS configuration, and assessed the impacts on the hydrography of
the coastal waters and offshore the Iberian Peninsula. Our approach is different in the
sense that, before applying a future climate scenario to the ocean model (chapter 6), we
first evaluate the performance of several CGCMs for the present climate and assess their
differences, rather than choosing only one CGCM as forcing for the ocean model. In this
way, we are aiming at finding the most adequate regional atmospheric forcing, both present
and future simulations.

Hence, the present work consists in a sensitivity study aiming at the evaluation CGCMs
as forcing in regional ocean simulations, with focus on FD (although sometimes extending
to the Eastern North Atlantic Basin or the North Atlantic), for the present climate. To
achieve this, the study is divided into two distinct parts. In the first part (section 5.3), the

100



output of nine CGCMs is analyzed regarding the variables needed to force ROMS. This is
carried out in two ways: an analysis of difference fields between every CGCM and COADS,
for every variable; and through the computation of the RMSE between each CGCM and
COADS, for every variable (section 5.3.9). In the second part (section 5.4), two of the
CGCMs with the highest RMSE relative to COADS are set as surface forcing for two
ROMS runs, with the purpose of assessing the range of uncertainty comprised in this set
of CGCMs. In addition, two other ROMS simulations are carried out: one forced with
COADS, which serves as the control run; the other forced with the average of the nine
CGCMs — the ensemble mean. The ultimate goal of the sensitivity study is to find the
most suitable forcing for this region and, hence, the one that should be used to evaluate
ocean climate change based on future climate scenarios.

5.2 Data and Methodology

5.2.1 Forcing variables

The variables needed to force ROMS, which comprise the COADS climatology and
which will be compared for each CGCM, are the following: sea level pressure (SLP, in
Pa); surface air temperature (SAT, in oC), radiation fluxes (longwave, shortwave and net
heat balance, the latter including latent and sensible heat transfer — SW, LW and NH,
respectively, in W m?2), water flux into ocean (evaporation minus precipitation — E-P,
in mm d?1 — including the discharge of the world main rivers), sea surface temperature
(SST, in oC), sea surface salinity (SSS), wind stress (zonal and meridional components —
Tx and Ty, in N m?2); and specific humidity (SH, in g kg?1), which will only be analyzed
in the RMSE study. These variables are inter-compared through difference fields between
each CGCM and COADS, and through the RMSE computed for FD, also between each
CGCM and COADS.

5.2.2 Climatologies

The climatology used for both the CGCM inter-comparison and the ROMS control run
is the Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). COADS has been, by
excellence, the used climatology for such regional ocean modeling studies (e.g. Marchesiello
et al., 2001) and this data set is described in section 2.2.1.

The CGCM sea level pressure is compared with the National Center for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis project uses a state-
of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation using past data from 1948
to the present (Kalnay et al., 1996).

101



5.2.3 CGCMs

The IPCC model data for this study were retrieved from the World Climate Research
Programme (WCRP — http://www.wcrp-climate.org/) through the Coupled Model Inter-
comparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) archived at the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis
and Inter-comparison (PCMDI) (http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about ipcc.php). This
program has made available a multi-model dataset of outputs from over 20 GCMs, for every
IPCC future climate change scenario, as well as the past and present climate, plus several
runs for each model that started from different initial conditions (Meehl et al., 2007).

From the large PCMDI database, we selected nine models, chosen because they included
not only an atmospheric model but also an ocean module to provide ocean forcing variables
(coupled models — CGCMs). CGCMs also have ocean temperature and salinity vertical
profiles, but preliminary analyses have shown that values were very far from the World
Ocean Atlas 2009 (Antonov et al., 2010; Locarnini et al., 2010) and, therefore, not suited as
vertical initial and boundary conditions. Instead, the WOA09 is used in the CGCM-forced
runs, as it is in the control run. The models are listed in Table 5.1, where their name,
origin and spatial resolution are presented. The CGCM output is monthly averaged for
each variable (described in section 5.2.1), and for the same period of COADS (1945-1989)
(see section 2.2.1). The approach is to run climatological simulations; hence, the daily
values of all variables for period 1945-1989 are averaged into a data set of monthly means.
Therefore, each ROMS run year is forced with the same monthly values.

For the computation of the ensemble mean, which consists in the average of all the
CGCMs considered in this study, each CGCM climatology is gridded to 2.5o ×2.5o (1.25o ×
1.25o for the ocean) by means of bicubic interpolation, after the application of a land mask.
Finally, a plain averaging of the nine CGCMs is computed for every variable.

5.2.4 ROMS Configuration

ROMS setup is similar to that of chapter 2, that is, a climatological run, and the domain
is FD. All runs have WOA09 as initial and boundary conditions, and each of the four runs
has the respective surface forcing, as described in the previous section. SST and SSS
undergo the same heat correction as in the climatological run to take into account thermal
feedback at the ocean surface and to avoid numerical drift, using the CGCM monthly
means. Each run final 5 years of output is averaged and we thus obtain climatological
values.

5.2.5 Error Computation

As previously carried out in chapter 3, in the evaluation of the CGCMs the root mean
square error (RMSE) (Wilks, 2006) is computed in order to quantify how close the CGCM

output is to COADS (the considered reference) as forcing:

RMSE =

N

?

i

(Mi ? Ci)2 (5.1)

where i is each grid point, Mi is CGCM output for grid point i, Ci is COADS output
for grid point i and N is the number of grid points.

5.3 CGCM Inter-comparison

The CGCM inter-comparison is carried out in two complementary ways: first, winter
and summer difference fields between each variable and the climatological correspondent,
for each CGCM, are presented. Most fields concern the entire North Atlantic (Figure 1.1 a),
to enable the analysis of the complete patterns, others concern an enlarged area around
FD, that is called in this work Eastern North Atlantic Basin (ENAB) (Figure 1.1 b) for
simplification. This domain is used when a more detailed analysis of the mean field is
justified. Second, the seasonal cycle of each variable, averaged over FD (Figure 1.1 c), as
well as the respective RMSE, are analyzed.

5.3.1 Climatological Mean Fields

Figures 5.1 and 5.2 show the climatological mean fields of each variable for winter and
summer, respectively (NCEP for the case of SLP, COADS for all the others). The typ-
ical winter and summer patterns are evident in these fields: in SLP (Figures 5.1,5.2 a),
the typical winter dipole between the Iceland Low and the Azores High, as well as the
northward migration of the former in summer; the northward summer warming in SAT
(Figures 5.1,5.2 b); prevailing precipitation in winter and evaporation in summer (Fig-
ures 5.1,5.2 e); the Earth’s heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer (Figures 5.1,5.2 g-
i); and the less seasonal varying in the ocean (Figures 5.1,5.2 c,d). Finally, close to the
coast, the winds show prevailing northerly flow in summer, consistent with the presence of
the Azores High, while in winter winds are in general weak and often with no meridional
component, contrary to what could be expected from the SLP winter conditions, prone
for the passage of low-pressure systems that are characterized by southerly/southwesterly
winds. This is an important aspect of COADS, that is discussed throughout this work.

5.3.2 Sea Level Pressure (SLP)

The pressure fields are the main driving mechanisms of the entire climate system. Fig-
ure 5.3 shows the differences between each model and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for
winter. Figure 5.4 presents the same but for summer. In winter, all models overestimate
SLP over Greenland and the majority does so also at midlatitudes (30-40oN), with CC-
CMA, CNRM and CSIRO (Figure 5.3 a,b,d) presenting this positive difference up to the

equator. The exceptions are GISS, MRI and UKMO (Figure 5.3 f-h), which present neg-
ative differences for this region, the typical location of the Azores High. There is also a
general underestimation of pressure over Great Britain. Even for a variable that presents
a more or less steady seasonal behavior such as SLP, the results vary greatly from model
to model. In the end, the ensemble (Figure 5.3 j) presents the lowest differences when
comparing to observations, with a tendency to intensify the high-pressure centers and at-
tenuate the low-pressure centers in relation to the observed values. In summer (Figure 5.4),
the positive differences are displaced northward, as is the Azores High center; therefore the
models overestimation remains related to the same phenomenon. This general positive
difference is the main feature of the multi-model ensemble mean (Figure 5.4 j). In the
area delimited by the coasts of Europe, Africa and South America, the general signal is
negative, especially in GISS and UKMO (Figure 5.4 f,h), with the exception of CCCMA,
CNRM and CSIRO (Figure 5.4 a,b,d), which roughly overestimate SLP throughout the
North Atlantic. These models were already the exception in winter.

5.3.3 Surface Air Temperature (SAT)

SAT is also a variable of consequence to the ocean surface in terms of air-sea interac-
tion. In addition, it is the parameter on which climate change is most strikingly reflected.
Figure 5.5 shows the differences between each model and COADS for winter, Figure 5.6
the same for summer. It is interesting to notice that the majority of models overestimates
SAT over the Gulf Stream and most of these all along the North Atlantic Current path.
This is accompanied by an underestimation of SAT around Greenland. Moreover, SAT
within the subtropical gyre tends to be lower than COADS (Figure 5.5 c,e,i). These are
the main features that are reflected in the ensemble (Figure 5.5 j). CSIRO and UKMO
(Figure 5.5 d,h) show warmer SATs along the western coasts of Europe and Africa, while
GISS and MPI (Figure 5.5 f,i) overestimate SAT near the equator. In summer (Figure 5.6),
the overestimation over the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Current is less evident; on
the contrary, there are some models that present lower SATs than the observations. There
is higher discrepancy between models in this season. The main differences, reflected on the
corresponding ensemble, are, again, an underestimation in the region of the subtropical
gyre and an overestimation near the equator off the African coast. As far as the Iberian
Peninsula coast is concerned, SAT is less than 1oC lower in winter and less than 1oC higher
in summer, which may be due to the influence of the SAT overland.

5.3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

The differences of SST between climatology and models (Figures 5.7 and 5.8) present
some similarities to those of surface air temperature, namely the tendency of the models
to underestimate SST in the region of the subtropical gyre. However, the models are
less coincidental. In general, in winter (Figure 5.7) there is overestimation of SST in
the Gulf Stream and underestimation in the region of the subtropical gyre. SST around
Greenland is underestimated by the majority of models, and some of them extend this

negative difference along the coast of America, contouring the positive anomaly of the
Gulf Stream (Figure 5.7 a-c,e,g). The differences change signal around the equator. The
ensemble (Figure 5.7 j) shows a general negative difference of 1-3oC, with the exception of
the area of the Gulf Stream. In summer (Figure 5.8), this pattern is even more generalized
and fewer models present the overestimation over the Gulf Stream. Observing the eastern
basin, the ensemble results are better for winter than for summer: the differences in relation
to COADS are of less than 1oC in winter and 1 to 2oC in summer.

5.3.5 Sea Surface Salinity (SSS)

Salinity is the variable that models find the hardest to reproduce. It is a parame-
ter harder to calibrate, since there are no satellite products on which to validate. It is
rapidly influenced by the precipitation-evaporation balance and river discharge and it de-
pends strongly on density. Due to the SSS weak seasonality (salinity distribution does not
vary substantially throughout the year), we present results for winter only (Figure 5.9).
The discrepancy between models is very high, although the differences of between mod-
els and COADS are somewhat similar to those of SST (Figures 5.7 and 5.8): overesti-
mation of SSS in the Gulf Stream, underestimations along the North Atlantic Current
(Figure 5.9 a,c,h,i), in the region of the subtropical gyre (Figure 5.9 a,f,g) and around
Greenland (Figure 5.9 a,d,e). There is also an overall lower SSS near the equator as repro-
duced by the models, reflected on the ensemble (Figure 5.9 j). Once again, the ensemble
succeeds in minimizing the differences of individual models in relation to observed data, as
it presents the lowest differences when comparing to COADS. Off the Iberian Peninsula,
differences are less than 0.5.

5.3.6 Evaporation Minus Precipitation (E-P)

Before entering further into this variable, it is necessary to properly define it. Evapo-
ration minus precipitation is a water flux input measurement. When positive, evaporation
is higher than precipitation (negative water flux into ocean), and vice-versa for negative
values. In what COADS is concerned, it consists only of an atmospheric water flux, but for
the CGCMs, the river input is also taken into account. Furthermore, the differences be-
tween models and climatology do not have a straightforward meaning. Positive differences,
for instances, can mean the model shows stronger evaporation than COADS or that the
fluxes at that point are reversed. Therefore, we choose to present results for the eastern
basin only (Figures 5.10 and 5.11). There is no river making the difference in water flux;
here the differences reflect essentially the ability of the models to well reproduce the pre-
cipitation/evaporation cycle. Models vary greatly between them. The highest differences
are in winter (Figure 5.10), in the northwestern corner, typically the location of the North
Atlantic Current, and also in the Bay of Biscay and off Great Britain, a region of strong
and constant rains. In summer (Figure 5.11), there is a general low negative difference
throughout the domain and the ensemble once again is able to minimize individual model
differences.

5.3.7 Wind Stress

Figures 5.12 and 5.13 show the vectorial differences of wind stress between each model
and COADS for winter and summer, respectively, once more for the eastern basin rather
than the North Atlantic. Several models present strong differences near the coast (Fig-
ure 5.12 a,e,f; Figure 5.13 a,b,h) that can be accounted for by the vicinity of land and
the land-sea shear due to thermal wind. In general, in winter (Figure 5.12), models show
stronger northeastward winds north and west of the Iberian Peninsula than COADS. This
difference is due to the fact that the COADS winds in winter, rather than being essen-
tially southerly as expected from typical low-pressure systems in this season, are southward
or with no meridional component. As for summer (Figure 5.13), the overall wind stress
pattern is very similar to COADS, especially in the ensemble mean (Figure 5.13 j). In
general, all models slightly overestimate southward wind stress along both coasts of the
Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Some models (Figure 5.13 a,c,e,i) intensify the Azores
High circulation, seen in the northeastward difference to the north and the southwestward
difference to the south.

5.3.8 Radiation Fluxes

Radiation fluxes are an important surface forcing and a relevant aspect to look at.
Figure 5.14 shows the radiation fluxes difference fields between COADS and the multi-
model ensemble mean for winter (upper row) and summer (lower row) in the ENAB.
Radiation fluxes differ greatly from model to model and season to season. We chose to show
for the basin and for the ensemble only because for these parameters the large-scale patterns
are not so important as the local input. The left column concerns the incoming shortwave
radiation flux (SW), the middle column the outgoing longwave radiation flux (LW) and the
right column the net heat balance (NH). This balance is computed taking into account not
only the SW and LW fluxes but also the latent and sensible heat fluxes, and the result is the
downward minus upward balance. SW and LW fluxes (Figure 5.14 a,b,d,e) are fairly well
represented by the ensemble mean in relation to COADS, with the exception of summer
SW flux (Figure 5.14 d), underestimated by the ensemble in the entire domain. In respect
to NH (Figure 5.14 c,f), the concordance between datasets is less agreeable. In winter, the
ensemble overestimates NH up to 60 W m?2 while in summer it presents lower values than
COADS south of 36oN and off the Iberian Peninsula by about 30-40 W m?2. The much
coarser model resolution and consequently the aggravated difficulty in reproducing latent
and sensible heat may be a reason for this discrepancy.

5.3.9 CGCM Forcing Seasonal Cycles

The seasonal cycles of all variables, averaged over FD (Figure 1.1 c), are presented in
Figure 5.15, superimposed to the COADS (control) cycle and the ensemble mean cycle. For
each variable, the CGCM set covers a range of values; in some cases this range is wider (e.g.
LW, SSS) than others (e.g. SW, NH). The performance of each CGCM relative to COADS

depends on the variable. For instances: CNRM overestimates SLP and underestimates LW,
but compares well in Ty and E-P; GFDL underestimates SAT and SST, but agrees well
in SW and NH; GISS underestimates Tx and overestimates E-P, but is adequate in SSS.
Overall, we cannot state from a first observation which model is the closest to COADS.

Figure 5.16 presents the RMSE of each CGCM relative to COADS, for every variable.
RMSE varies strongly seasonally, and we confirm the observations of Figure 5.15, that
is, the good or bad performance of a CGCM depends on the variable. It is not possible
to draw a best and a worst model in comparison to COADS. Yet, the ensemble mean
presents consistently low errors for all variables, although it is rarely the one with the
lowest RMSE. A few CGCMs stand out as having high RMSEs for several variables. For
instances: CSIRO and GFDL for SAT and E-P; CNRM for SLP and LW; CCCMA and
MRI for Tx and Ty.

This inter-comparison does not allow us to clearly identify one CGCM as the best for
all variables and disregard all the others. This is why we choose to force ROMS with

two CGCMs that will encompass all the others in terms of the variability range of the
ensemble. Bearing this in mind, and given the differences among CGCMs from variable
to variable, we focus on one of the ocean variables: SSS (Figures 5.15, 5.16 j), which is
difficult to reproduce in coarse resolution models. The two models that stand out in terms
of overestimation and underestimation are CSIRO and CCCMA, respectively. Differences
between CSIRO and COADS are about +0.5 to +0.8 (Figure 5.15 j), with a RMSE of
approximately 0.28 (Figure 5.16 j), and CSIRO differences from the ensemble mean are
roughly +0.7 throughout the year. CCCMA, on the other hand, differs from COADS by
-0.5 to -0.8 and from the ensemble mean by approximately -0.5, while RMSE ranges from
0.19 to 0.25. The choice of CCCMA instead of, for instances, MPI, which also presents
a high RMSE regarding SSS, is based on the relatively high RMSE that CCCMA also
presents for LW, Tx and Ty; moreover, for SW and NH it also differs substantially from
the ensemble mean.

Thus, the following section is an analysis of four ROMS runs with similar configurations

(a) COADS, which will be the control run; (b) CCCMA; (c) CSIRO; and (d) the ensemble
mean, henceforth ENSEM.

5.4 ROMS Runs

ROMS output of the four simulations is analyzed by means of surface fields and vertical
slices of the ocean upper levels at key regions in the domain, focusing on the hydrography
and circulation. Some seasonal characterization is also carried out through Hovmo?ller
diagrams. For a better assessment, some of the results are presented as differences between
each CGCM-forced run and the COADS-forced (control) run. Results will be shown as
monthly means of the last 5 years of simulation. For simplification, ROMS runs will be
identified as follow: the COADS-forced run will be referred to as R COADS, and similarly
R CCCMA, R CSIRO, R ENSEM.

The analysis will be focused on FD. Less attention will be paid to the regions near the
boundaries, namely the Bay of Biscay and the Morocco northwestern coast.

5.4.1 Surface Fields

The January mean fields of SST and SSS (Figure 5.18 a,b) have a zonal distribution,
except close to the coast north of 40oN, where a warmer (14oC) and saltier (35.8) tongue
of water contours the northwest tip of the Iberian Peninsula — the signature of the IPC.
R CCCMA (Figure 5.18 c,d) presents SST differences in general lower than 1oC, except in
coastal areas. Regarding SSS, differences are always negative and vary from about 0.4-0.8
offshore to 0.8-1.2 close to the coast, and in general to the east of the Azores. R CSIRO
(Figure 5.18 e,f) overestimates temperature in general between 1 and 2oC, and by more
than 2oC in the northwestern corner of the domain. SSS differences are mostly between
0.4 and 0.8, higher along the coast. As for R ENSEM (Figure 5.18 g,h), SST differences
are mostly within ±1oC throughout the domain, and SSS differences are almost always
lower than 0.4 in module.

For July (Figure 5.19), the surface mean fields show the signature of coastal upwelling,
with a narrow band of cold water (&lt;18oC, Figure 5.19 a) off the entire WIM and a south-
ward deflection of isohalines (Figure 5.19 b) in the same region. Observing the differences,
all runs present strong negative differences (greater than -5oC) in the Gulf of Cadiz, mean-
ing that all CGCM-forced runs overestimate coastal upwelling in that area with respect
to the control run. This happens because, unlike the COADS-forced run, they represent
upwelling as a continuous band of cold coastal water in the Gulf of Cadiz, as if there were
no gap at the Strait of Gibraltar. Most CGCMs, given their general coarse resolution, have
a single grid point over the Gulf of Cadiz. Over-land air temperature is always higher than
over-ocean in summer; hence, although a land mask was applied to all CGCM output, and
given that the Gulf of Cadiz grid point is surrounded by land from three sides (and thus
under some influence of land temperatures), this land-ocean temperature gradient intensi-
fies alongshore winds. Indeed, observing the mean wind stress fields for July (Figure 5.13),
it is clear that at the Gulf of Cadiz, and for all CGCMs, including the ensemble mean, the
alongshore wind stress is higher than in COADS.

R CCCMA (Figure 5.19 c,d) tends to underestimate temperature relative to R COADS
near coastal areas by values higher than 1oC in module, and in the rest of the domain the
range in temperature differences is approximately ±1oC. Salinity differences vary mostly
between 0.4 and 1.2. R CSIRO (Figure 5.19 e,f) strongly overestimates SST, especially to
the north/northwest, reaching a difference of up to 5oC. At the WIM, however, differences
vary between -1oC and 1oC. In terms of SSS, differences are always positive, mostly
between 0.4 and 1.2. As for R ENSEM (Figure 5.19 g,h), SST differences are mostly
between -2 and 0oC. SSS differences on the other hand are lower than 0.4 in module,
except in the northwestern corner of the domain, the Gulf of Cadiz and north of the
Iberian Peninsula.

Figure 5.20 shows the zonally-averaged seasonal cycle of SST and SSS for the four
runs. The SST cycle (Figure 5.20, left column) is well reproduced by both R CCCMA and
R ENSEM, although in the former temperatures south of 35oN are warmer in winter and
cooler in summer by ? 1oC, and in the latter temperatures south of 34oN are warmer in
winter and colder in summer south of 40oN. Also, there is a phase lag of about one month

in the temperature cycle. On the other hand, R CSIRO is always warmer, independently
of the latitude. In winter, temperature differences are ? 1oC in the southern part and
? 2oC in the northern part, and there is a sudden increase in temperature in spring,
seen by the vertical N-S orientation of the isotherms especially between May and July:
2oC (3oC) to the south (north) in one month. Also, there is no meridional temperature
gradient during summer, and the highest temperature is found at 42oN and not to the
south. In respect to the average SSS cycle (Figure 5.20, right column), R CCCMA does
not represent it properly, with differences from 0.8 in winter to 1 in summer. CSIRO
overestimates salinities by 0.6 (0.4) in the northern (southern) part but the seasonal cycle
is well reproduced. R ENSEM presents lower values than R COADS, with differences
of -0.2 in summer/autumn to the south and up to -0.4 to the north, whereas in winter
differences are mostly -0.2.

5.4.2 Azores Current

As stated before, the Azores Current (AzC) is an important dynamical features of the
region, and therefore it is important to achieve a good numerical representation. For the
evaluation of the ability of the CGCMs under study, we choose to show, for all ROMS runs,
Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) surface mean fields (Figure 5.21) and a meridional section of
the zonal (u) component of the velocity, superimposed by temperature (Figure 5.22 a-
d) to explore the thermohaline front typical of the AzC. The u variance is also shown
(Figure 5.22 e-h). These profiles are represented along 20oW between 33oN and 37oN (the
mean location of the AzC) from the surface down to 1000 m deep.

R COADS EKE shows a strong signal around the average location of the AzC. A
comparison between R COADS EKE and altimetry-based EKE was presented in chapter 2
(Figure 2.3), with very good agreement on the main dynamical patterns. On the other
hand, R CCCMA does not present clear signals, having strong EKE small regions spread
throughout the domain. R CSIRO has two main regions of strong EKE, again between
32oN and 36oN and another to the northwest of the domain. R ENSEM also shows an

129



EKE maximum around AzC and alongshore the eastern boundary, as did the other models,
associated with coastal circulation instabilities such as filaments and eddies.

row) u variance (m2 s?2) for run (a,e) R COADS; (b,f) R CCCMA; (c,g) R CSIRO; (d,h)
R ENSEM. The blue lines denote zero u.

Concerning the across section (see Figure 5.17), the associated thermohaline front is in
general reproduced by ROMS, no matter which surface forcing is applied. R COADS (Fig-
ure 5.22 a,e) shows a primary core centered approximately at 34-34.5oN and a secondary one
south of 33oN. The current is stronger in the upper 350 m but reaches down to 1000 m, and
its maximum is roughly 6 cm s?1. The variance maximum is mostly between 34 and 35oN
in the upper 100 m, with maximum values of 8×10?3 m2s?2. R CCCMA (Figure 5.22 b,f)
presents a strengthened AzC, reaching 7 cm s?1 at the surface and down to 500 m, due
to the stronger temperature gradient. On the other hand, the variance indicates that the
AzC does not greatly vary either in latitude or in depth. R CSIRO (Figure 5.22 c,g) re-
produces a wider AzC from 33.5oN to 35.5oN, reaching the depths of R CCCMA and the
velocity surface values of R COADS. Surface temperature is overestimated by about 1oC.
Its variance suggests that the AzC core can also be found southward. Finally, R ENSEM
(Figure 5.22 d,h) apparently presents a less concordant comparison with R COADS con-
cerning u, with velocities barely reaching 5 cm s?1 in the upper 200 m and a more disperse
signature along the section. However, variance shows the strongest variability of the cur-

130



rent in latitude, and presents the strongest values (10?2 m2s?2) of the four runs centered at
the surface at about 33.5oN and 34.5oN. This value in variance means a standard deviation
of ±0.1 m s?1, reflecting a strong seasonal variability of the modeled current. Thus, it
is possible that the AzC cores are present all the same, but varying strongly in location.
R ENSEM also presents the best comparison in terms of the temperature distribution in
depth.

5.4.3 WIM Cross-shore Sections

For the cross-shore profiles, we discuss the section along 42oN for January (Figure 5.23)
and the section along 38oN for July (Figure 5.24) of the ROMS runs. (see Figure 5.17 for
the location of the sections). These sections and these months were thus chosen because
the Iberian Poleward Current usually associated with wintertime is stronger at northern
latitudes. On the other hand, upwelling is fairly similar in intensity along the coast; in
choosing a more southern latitude we aim at a complete WIM representation.

For January (Figure 5.23), the main fields of R COADS show a temperature and salin-
ity signal consistent with the IPC over the slope in the upper layers (? 15oC and ? 36),
and a low salinity minimum is also visible between 400 and 500 m deep (? 35.6), attributed
to the ENACW signature. In what concerns temperature (Figure 5.23, left column), the
model that shows the most striking difference is R CSIRO (Figure 5.23 e), where temper-
atures are higher than any of the other simulations, reaching up to 2oC in the upper slope.
On the other hand, R CCCMA (Figure 5.23 c) presents a -0.5oC at the upper slope, as
does R ENSEM (Figure 5.23 d) at some points in the upper layers. Concerning salinity
(Figure 5.23, right column), R CCCMA (Figure 5.23 d) underestimates salinity up to 1
in the upper 100 m and down to 200 m when approaching the coast, and R CSIRO (Fig-
ure 5.23 f) overestimates it in the same order close to the coast and reaching deeper near
the slope (? 350 m). On the contrary, R ENSEM (Figure 5.23 h) shows differences mostly
lower than -0.2 on the entire section.

For July, at latitude 38oN (Figure 5.24), the rising of the isotherms and isohalines
is observed near the coast, typical of upwelling, along again with the fresh signature of
the ENACW. There is the same tendency of R CCCMA and R ENSEM to underestimate
and R CSIRO to overestimate values. In what concerns temperature, R CCCMA (Fig-
ure 5.24 d) presents negative differences in the upper 300 m, strongest at the continental
shelf/upper slope where they are greater than -2oC. This suggests an overestimation of
the upwelling strength. The same behavior is observed for R ENSEM (Figure 5.24 h),
although the differences are less prominent (? 1.5oC at the shelf/slope and lower than 1oC
mostly elsewhere). On the other hand, R CSIRO (Figure 5.24 f) overestimates strongly
not at the upper levels, but rather between 200 and 400 m (500 m close to the slope). The
maximum difference of 2oC occurs along roughly 300 m. This suggests that CSIRO does
not reproduce well the typical temperatures of the ENACW, which round 12-13oC, thus
exceeding them by 1 to 2oC.

Salinity shows similar differences to those of January at 42oN: R CCCMA (Figure 5.24
d) underestimates it by roughly 1 at the surface down to 0.2 at about 300 m; R CSIRO

131

R COADS. 132



Figure 5.24: Same as Figure 5.23 but for July and across 38oN (see Figure 5.17).

133



(Figure 5.24 f) presents differences of up to 0.8 in the area between 200 and 300 m, the
same region where the temperature difference was the highest; R ENSEM (Figure 5.24 h)
shows more spread negative differences of about 0.2 in the upper 200 m.

From the analysis of these sections, we conclude that the difficulties the CGCM-forced
runs have in reproducing the hydrography, at least in this particular area, are verified
mostly in the upper 500 m, down to the basis of the central waters. It is also clear that
R ENSEM is the simulation that presents the lowest differences relative to the control run
(R COADS).

In a different approach, we look at horizontal fields of the velocity meridional component
(v), averaged between the depths of 50 and 100 m (excluding the Ekman layer). At 42oN
(Figure 5.25), note the all-negative v close to the coast (east of 9.5oW) in R COADS.
Velocities in the control run associated with the upwelling equatorward jet do not surpass
10 cm s?1 and occur in average between March and September. As far as the other runs are
concerned, in late autumn/winter (from October to March) velocities are positive (about
5 cm s?1 in R CSIRO — Figure 5.25 c — and between 5 and 10 cm s?1 in R CCCMA and
R ENSEM — Figure 5.25 b,d) and in summer southward velocities reach 20 cm s?1 for
R CCCMA and 15 cm s?1 for R CSIRO and R ENSEM. These differences arise from the
different wind fields between forcing datasets. A comparison between the average seasonal
wind fields of COADS and of each CGCM including the ensemble (see Figures 5.12 and 5.13,
and also 5.1, 5.2 f) showed that COADS winter winds have nearly zero zonal components,
whereas model winds frequently have a westerly/southwesterly component. On the other
hand, summer northerly winds are slightly weaker in COADS than in the CGCMs. CGCMs
capture the v seasonality such that ROMS simulates northward circulation in winter and
stronger southward circulation during summer relative to COADS.

Offshore (between 9.5 and 10.5oW) all runs show an almost constant poleward flow,
which reaches its maximum value of 20 cm s?1 in August. Typical of eastern boundary
current systems, upper slope poleward flows are usually associated with winter circulation
due to the presence of summer coastal upwelling. However, as seen in chapter 2, the Iberian
Poleward Current may exist throughout the year, although occurring more offshore in sum-
mer. This westward displacement in spring is clear in the R ENSEM field (Figure 5.9 d),
with velocities almost always above 5 cm s?1.

At 38oN (Figure 5.26), the general patterns are similar to those at 42oN, except that the
poleward flow is weaker, both coastal and more offshore during summer, barely reaching
15 cm s?1 in August around 10oW. On the other hand, in R CCCMA (Figure 5.26 b) and
R ENSEM (Figure 5.26 d) the upwelling-associated equatorward jet is stronger, the first
being always higher than 20 cm s?1 from April to November, and the second reaching
20 cm s?1 in August. R COADS (Figure 5.26 a), however, simulates a weaker upwelling
relative to 42oN, and with an inversion of flow direction near the coast in winter, with
velocities below 5 cm s?1. R CSIRO (Figure 5.26 c) presents also southward velocities
lower than at 42oN. The differences in winds as discussed regarding Figure 5.9 also account
for these observations.

5.5 Discussion

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the ability of available CGCM output to force
a regional ocean model configuration. A preliminary inter-comparison was carried out for
all variables, and an RMSE analysis was performed for each CGCM against the COADS
climatology, our control data set. It was clear that there was no consensus in determining
the best or the worst model to reproduce climatological values. Different models compared
better with COADS regarding different variables. The ensemble of CGCMs encompasses
a set of values for each variable, and for most variables COADS lies within that range,
which means that the ensemble mean is often very close to the climatological value. Out
of the nine CGCMs, two were selected to be used as forcing in ROMS simulations. The
objective was to choose one that overestimated values in relation to COADS, and another
that would underestimate them. In the end we selected CSIRO and CCCMA. The former
frequently presents the highest RMSE, while the latter was chosen based on the fact that

it underestimated SSS the most.
ROMS was forced with these two CGCMs, as well as with the ensemble mean (EN-

SEM), and finally with COADS, which represented the control run. With these four runs
we aim at illustrating the entire CGCM range of values. In terms of thermohaline prop-
erties (Figures 5.19-5.21), it is clear from the ROMS surface fields of temperature and
salinity that the ocean model results are strongly dependent on the respective forcing. The
overestimation of CSIRO and underestimation of CCCMA, particularly of SST and SSS,
are fed into ROMS, such that the ocean simulations present the same tendencies in the
upper layers. On this matter, the ensemble mean proves to be the most suitable, as would
be expected from the forcing inter-comparison of sections 5.3, in the sense that R ENSEM
is the run that presents the most similar hydrographical and dynamical fields with respect
to R COADS (the control run). This is evident in the zonally averaged seasonal signal of
SST and SSS for the entire domain (Figure 5.21). This result agrees with numerous works
in the literature, e.g. Pierce et al. (2009), and is attributed to the fact that averaging
multiple models may reduce their individual uncertainties and result in an intermediate
solution that compares better with climatological values.

136



These conclusions also apply to the deeper layers, namely at coastal locations off WIM
(Figure 5.23-5.26), as far down as 500 m, especially in the case of the CSIRO-forced run.
As stated in section 5.3, in this case, the wind stress plays the most important role in the
intensity variations of the upwelling-associated equatorward jet, as well as the seasonal-
varying poleward flow. However, it is worth mentioning the influence that surface forcing
in regional ocean modeling has on the proper reproduction of intermediate level water
properties. Inadequate values of surface input leads not only to incorrect modeled ocean
surface patterns / seasonal cycles, but also incorrect intermediate water values, and hence
wrong derived dynamics.

The Azores Current is reproduced in all four runs. Although in terms of its mean lo-
cation they all resemble, in terms of intensity and vertical profile they differ greatly. The
reason for this may lie with the thermohaline distribution in depth. The CCCMA-forced
run presents a steeper front, with lower temperatures/salinities north of 34.5oN and higher
temperatures/salinities to the south of 34.5oN, enabling a stronger flow. The CSIRO-forced
run, on the other hand, is uniformly warmer/saltier on the whole, as the ensemble-forced
run is colder/fresher, thus producing weaker associated currents. Nevertheless, the vari-
ance of the results allows to postulate that all ROMS runs represent well the AzC, but
the location of the current varies more throughout the year, which means that its signal
is not as strong when computing the yearly average. Despite this observation, the impor-
tance of having proper temperature and salinity (and thus density) vertical distributions
is reinforced. And since initial and boundary conditions are the same for the four runs, as
well as the same numerical configuration, these distributions depend solely on the different
surface input provided by each forcing.

With the CCCMA- and the CSIRO-forced runs we intended to illustrate the range of
possible ROMS output that the ensemble of nine CGCMs could provide without actually
carrying out the nine ROMS simulations. The first conclusion we may draw is that the use
of forcing obtained from a particular CGCM in an ocean simulation should be considered
with caution. Secondly, in light of all considerations, both regarding the CGCM inter-
comparison and the ROMS runs, the ensemble mean stands out as the most adequate
forcing for FD with respect to any other individual CGCM, particularly supported by
the results of the R ENSEM simulation, which we have shown that provides the most
realistic physical results concerning the hydrography and circulation fields when compared
to the control run (R COADS) for the present climate. As such, one may postulate that
simulations to evaluate future ocean climate change may also legitimately be forced with
the ensemble mean; that is, in using the ensemble mean for a future period, we would
be aiming at minimizing the uncertainties associated with every individual CGCM. This
application is carried out in chapter 6.

Chapter 6

A Future Climate Scenario, part 2:
Climate Change on the Western
Iberian Margin using ROMS

Part of the contents of this chapter has been published by Cordeiro Pires et al. (2013b).

6.1 Overview

This chapter consists in a case study of the impacts of a global climate change scenario
on the hydrography and dynamics of the Iberian Upwelling System through numerical
modeling.

As previously stated, given that upwelling systems undergo strong seasonal and in-
terannual variability, it is also likely they are very sensitive to climate change (Holt et
al., 2010). The work of Bakun (1990) was one of the earliest studies on the effects of
climate change on upwelling systems. The author postulated that a global increase in
surface air temperature over land would intensify the land-sea pressure gradient at coastal
regions, which in turn would cause an intensification of alongshore winds and subsequently
upwelling. Upwelling intensification would mean cooling of the sea surface temperature
(SST), which would result in a positive feedback in the land-sea pressure gradient. Since
then, several studies have been carried out, based either on SST or wind stress time series
from the last decades. Some of them confirm the Bakun hypothesis while others found a
weakening of the upwelling signal, depending on the dataset the results are based on and
the periods of computation (Narayan et al., 2010). Demarcq (2009) points out that one
of the main reasons of uncertainty in what concerns upwelling systems is the unknown be-
havior of wind patterns in the future, which is the main driver of eastern boundary coastal
dynamics. Analyzing satellite data, the author found both SST warming and equatorward
wind strengthening trends in upwelling systems. Particularly for the Iberian Peninsula,
increases were estimated to be 0.15oC decade?1 (0.44oC decade?1) in SST for period 1998-
2007 (2000-2007) and 1 m s?1 decade?1 in equatorward wind for period 2000-2007.

139



In what concerns the WIM, the work of Relvas et al. (2009) based on SST data,
provides evidence of upwelling enhancement since 1960 based on climatological in situ
data, corroborated by satellite data since 1985. However, Santos et al. (2005) (whose
study extends to the entire Eastern North Atlantic Upwelling System) hypothesize a long-
term variability behind the strengthening of upwelling from 1990 on. Conversely, Lemos
and Pires (2004) found a weakening trend for 1941-2000 when analyzing both meridional
wind component and SST datasets, although punctuated by strong interannual variability.
A general weakening for both Iberian and Canary upwelling regions was also found by
Pardo et al. (2011) from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data of SST and wind.

With the numerical modeling tools improvement of the past few years, providing good
performances on the reproduction of the dynamics of both the atmosphere and ocean, in
addition to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) climate studies, it
became possible to carry out future scenarios in the scope of climate change (Nakic?enovic?
et al., 2000). However, the general circulation models (GCMs) used in this international
effort are global and therefore have very coarse resolution. Recently, the increased challenge
has been to assess global change at a regional scale (Woolings, 2010). Therefore, climate
studies have been aiming at the improvement of GCM simulations and the development
of downscaling techniques toward regional, and thus more realistic, simulations (Hewitson
and Crane, 1996).

From the studies that focus on ocean circulation in a context of future climate change
scenarios by means of Coupled GCMs (CGCMs), there is a large number that focuses on
the thermohaline circulation and the impact of increases in temperature and CO2 con-
centration and consequent fresh water input (e.g. Gregory et al., 2005; Stouffer et al.,
2006). Furthermore, using a set of IPCC CGCMs, Diffenbaugh (2005) assessed the sensi-
tivity of large-scale eastern boundary currents to increased greenhouse gas concentrations,
discussing the limited ability of global climate models to predict more than the general
patterns and distribution of atmospheric pressure and surface winds, namely in what con-
cerns trends and interannual variability. Particularly regarding upwelling systems, Mote
and Mantua (2002) used two CGCMs to see how the seasonality and intensity of coastal
upwelling change in the four world systems, whereas Snyder et al. (2003) assessed future
changes in upwelling intensity for the California Current System based on CO2 concentra-
tion increase. However, while the former found no significant change in future years for
any of the world upwelling systems, the latter obtained results in agreement with Bakun
(1990) for California, that is, increasing of upwelling intensity and frequency. More re-
cently, Wang et al. (2010) evaluated the ability of several IPCC CGCMs in reproducing
upwelling seasonality and what future changes in atmospheric patterns would bring to the
Canary, the California and the Humboldt upwelling systems, and found the results differed
greatly from model to model, with some presenting a weakening of upwelling and others
showing intensification. For the WIM, Miranda et al. (2012) carried out a regional ocean
modeling study, using a regional atmospheric model as surface forcing, for the A2 IPCC
scenario and for period 2071-2100, and also found results in agreement with Bakun (1990).

Following these works, and the sensitivity study carried out in the previous chapter, the
present chapter consists in a comparison between the present mean circulation features of

140



the upper levels along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula described in chapter 2 and
the dynamics imposed by a set of atmospheric conditions dictated by a future circulation
regime; in this case, based on the multi-model ensemble mean.

The choice of forcing for this study underwent several steps. In the first approach, the
goal was to find one global climate model that would compare well with our climatological
run of chapter 2, and which would consequently provide reasonable future forcing for the

141



scenario study. However, when we started to analyze the nine CGCM forcing (as described
in chapter 5), we soon realized that there was not one that outstood from the others, one
that would solely provide the best comparisons to the climatology when all variables were
taken into account. One would better represent radiation fluxes but be poor in E-P, the
other would be better in SST and SSS but be poor in SLP. That is why, in the end, the
multi-model ensemble mean was the selected future forcing; because in averaging the input
from all CGCMs we believe we are minimizing their uncertainties.

The results are presented first showing the differences between the ensemble present-
forced run and the COADS-forced run, and then between the ensemble future-forced run
and the ensemble present-forced run, which will be addressed as a possible future ocean
scenario, having validated first the present ensemble as adequate forcing.

For this study, ROMS is setup using the same configuration of chapter 2: offline nesting,
climatologically-forced, with FD providing initial and boundary conditions for SD. Three
runs are taken into consideration: the one described in chapter 2, with COADS as surface
forcing, which consists in the control run; one forced with a climatology constructed for
the same period as COADS, that it, 1945-1989, from the multi-model ensemble mean;
and one forced with a future climatology (2071-2100), also constructed from the ensemble
mean. The methodology used to obtain these climatologies is the same as described in the
previous chapter (section 5.2). The CGCMs that compose the multi-model ensemble mean
are listed in Table 5.1. As mentioned in chapter 5, the ensemble-forced FD runs are fed
with the same initial and boundary conditions as the COADS-forced run, since the vertical
hydrographical fields provided by the CGCMs were not realistic (not shown).

The chosen emission scenario from the IPCC future climate projections assessment
report from 2007 (AR4) was the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario
(Nakic?enovic? et al., 2000). The SRES scenarios are grouped into four scenario families (A1,
A2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range
of demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting greenhouse gas
emissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate policies above current
ones. They can be summarized as follows:

• A1: assumes a world of very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks
in mid-century and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. A1 is
divided into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change:
fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all
sources (A1B).

• B1: describes a convergent world, with the same global population as A1, but with
more rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy.

• B2: describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, empha-
sizing local solutions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability.

• A2: describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic
development and slow technological change.

142



The A2 scenario is the most “business-as-usual” approach, where the basic social, eco-
nomical and technological behavior is maintained throughout the period under study (2001-
2100). There is not a scenario more likely than the other; the four encompass equally
possible changes in society. This choice was based on two factors. First, in the beginning
of this study, we had no idea what to expect either from the CGCM output or from the
ROMS simulations. Hence, the tendency was to choose a scenario where changes would
be marked; that is, one of the “worst” scenarios. Secondly, A2 along with A1B seem to be
the scenarios which are most frequently applied, based on the literature.

6.3 Results

For the analysis of the mean hydrography of the region, the following sub-sections
present: seasonal maps of wind stress; monthly-mean fields of SST and SSS; cross-shore
sections of temperature, salinity and meridional velocity along the WIM; the seasonal
cycle of SST, SSS and the upwelling index. This is carried out for the three runs. For
the horizontal and vertical slices, ROMS output was processed for January and July as
monthly averages from the last 5 years of a 10-year simulation.

6.3.1 Seasonal Wind Stress

Wind stress is one of the most important variables that must be well modeled for
a good reproduction of both hydrography and circulation. That is why it is described
first of all. Observing Figure 6.2, the ensemble presents roughly a meridional gradient,
whereas in COADS wind stress varies along a NW-SE axis in winter and autumn and
along a NE-SW axis in spring and summer. Furthermore, while in winter the ensemble
shows a clear south/southwesterly wind stress component, COADS wind stress is mostly
eastward and southeastward. That is, there are never downwelling-favorable conditions
according to COADS, which means that this forcing does not comprise e.g. strong storm
conditions associated with low-pressure systems, typical of winter. In spring, COADS
already presents a clear tendency for equatorward winds, whereas the ensemble wind,
although showing a southward component, is mostly directed onshore. In summer, the
ensemble presents stronger wind stress, especially south of 42oN, and in autumn COADS
and present ensemble have similar patterns as during wintertime, that is, an eastward and
southeastward tendency in COADS and relatively strong north/northeastward winds in
the ensemble. In the future, wind stress distribution remains mostly zonal, but enhanced,
especially to the north in winter and autumn and to the south in spring and summer.
In winter and autumn, south of 40oN, wind stress has a stronger southward component,
particularly noticeable in the Gulf of Cadiz. In summer, the strengthening is striking south
of 41oN, with an increase of wind stress intensity of &gt;0.02 N m?2.

The absence of a clear inversion on the wind direction in COADS as opposed to the
present ensemble will strongly influence the differences between the two runs, since the
wind stress plays a key role in dictating the thermohaline structure of the coastal ocean

and hence its circulation. Nevertheless, it is important to have a “control run” against
which to test our hypothesis, and as described in chapter 2 the COADS-forced SD run
traces a reasonably accurate portrait of the WIM hydrography and dynamics.

6.3.2 Surface Fields

Figure 6.3 presents SST (upper row) and SSS (lower row) fields for January, from the
three runs: COADS (Figure 6.3 a,f), present ensemble (Figure 6.3 b,g) and future ensemble
(Figure 6.3 c,h). Also represented are the difference fields between the ensemble and
COADS (Figure 6.3 d,i) and between future and present of the ensemble (Figure 6.3 e,j).
Figure 6.4 shows the same but for July. The differences between the control run and the
present ensemble will be addressed first, and then the differences between present ensemble
and future ensemble. Note the different color scale in the difference fields.

In winter (Figure 6.3), the present ensemble reproduces well the coastal warm and saline
tongue typical of the slope poleward flow, with the 13oC isotherm and the 35.7 isohaline
following the bathymetry along the northern coast of the WIM. On the other hand, COADS
shows more clearly the low temperature (&lt;12.5oC) and low salinity (&lt;35.7) band along the
coast north of the Estremadura Promontory. While low salinities are usually attributed to
winter river discharge, these low temperatures nearshore are due to winter cooling in the
continental shelf. This is also observed in the ensemble, but along a much narrower coastal
band, perhaps more restricted to the coast due to the presence of the stronger and well
defined poleward flow, that can partially overcome these lower temperatures and salinities.
That is why the alongshore differences (Figure 6.3 d,i) are positive. Furthermore, there
are generalized SSS negative differences offshore (-0.15 to -0.25).

In summer, both SST (Figure 6.4 a,b) and SSS (Figure 6.4 f,g) distributions are similar
when comparing present ensemble and COADS. Coastal upwelling is overestimated by the
former in SST with a clearly wider cold-water band along the western coast, most likely due
to the stronger equatorward winds (see Figure 6.2). In the ensemble runs, upwelling occurs
as if there were no land interruption at the Strait of Gibraltar. This has been discussed in
the previous chapter: most CGCMs, given their general coarse resolution, have a single grid
point over the Gulf of Cadiz, and hence do not reproduce well the winds at this location.
This accounts for the SST and SSS differences in the Gulf of Cadiz, including along the
southern coast of Portugal. Note that in the northwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula
upwelling is enhanced in SSS and weakened in SST by the ensemble.

For the future, the general tendency is for warming and for freshening of the ocean
surface. In winter (Figure 6.3), the SST increase is stronger near the coast (+2oC in
northern WIM and +2.5oC in southern WIM) and the SSS decrease is stronger offshore
(-0.2 in the northern quadrant, reaching -0.4 in the Gulf of Cadiz). The temperature
and salinity anomalies associated with the poleward flow surface signature are still visible,
although with higher temperatures and lower salinities along its path, relative to the present
ensemble. Note that both temperature and salinity onshore-offshore anomalies are similar
to the present, although the absolute values increase (decrease) in temperature (salinity).

In summer (Figure 6.4), the opposite occurs in SST: differences are greater offshore (up

three runs: COADS (a,f), present ensemble (b,g) and future ensemble (c,h). Difference

ensemble (e,j).

to +3.5oC), than onshore (+1oC in northern WIM and +1.5oC in southern WIM). For
SSS, the strongest differences remain offshore, up to -0.4 to the north and -0.2 to the south,
and are lower onshore (lower than -0.1 along northern WIM and about -0.15 along southern
WIM). The cross-shore gradient associated with coastal upwelling is enhanced and wider,
due to the higher warming rate of temperatures offshore than onshore. Nevertheless, note
that the width of the upwelling band has not increased, as could be expected from the
strengthening of upwelling-favorable winds observed in Figure 6.2. It has even decreased
in the southern WIM. This will be further discussed in the following section.

These results are expectable, since the basis of the IPCC A2 scenario is a global rise
in surface air temperatures, which has as consequence among many others freshwater
input from melting icecaps in the poles (Huybrechts et al., 2004). Furthermore, the higher
warming rate along the southern WIM than along the northern WIM is consistent with the
trends found by Relvas et al. (2009) when analyzing SST time series for period 1960-2005,
as well as satellite data from 1985 to 2008 and buoy data from 1960 to 2003.

6.3.3 WIM Cross-shore Sections

The following analysis concerns cross-shore sections at two latitudes off WIM: 42oN
and 38oN, where temperature, salinity and meridional velocity mean fields for January and
July are analyzed for each of the runs: COADS, present ensemble and future ensemble.
As before, the present runs are compared first, and then follows the comparison between
future and present of the ensemble.

The vertical hydrographical fields are presented in Figure 6.5 for January and in Fig-
ure 6.6 for July. Analyzing first the northern section in winter, COADS (Figure 6.5 a)
presents a tendency for low temperatures and salinities nearshore (note the upward of the
isotherms), consistent with the coastal narrow band of low temperatures and salinities
observed in Figure 6.3 attributed to winter cooling and river discharge, respectively. The
ensemble (Figure 6.5 b) shows in part lower salinities, and a warmer core that is formed
nearshore (closed isotherm 13.5oC centered at 9.2oW), the signature of the poleward flow
seen also in Figure 6.3. Onshore, temperatures are again 13oC.

At 38oN, for the upper 200 m, the surface coastal waters in the ensemble are warmer
by 0.5oC and isotherms are less steep at the upper slope, although an upward of isotherms
is visible in both runs. With respect to salinity, at the upper 200 m, it is generally
underestimated by the ensemble by 0.1-0.2.

Below 200 m, for both latitudes, the present ensemble (Figure 6.5 b,e) represents the
well temperature field. At 42oN, the salinity general distribution is well captured, although
the ensemble underestimates values by ? 0.1 at 42oN, especially noticeable at the MW
levels (800-1200 m). At these levels for section 38oN, on the other hand, the ensemble
shows good results in the reproduction of the MW salinity.

In summer (Figure 6.6), below 200 m, the differences between the two present simula-
tions are similar to those of winter: the temperature distribution compares well and salinity
is underestimated by the ensemble by about 0.1, especially striking at the depths of the
MW (800-1200 m). In the upper 200 m, while at 42oN temperature in the ensemble still

Figure 6.6: Same as Figure 6.5 but for July.

compares well with COADS and salinity maintains a -0.1 difference, at 38oN temperature
is lower by about 1oC and salinity differences can reach 0.3, consistent with a stronger and
wider upwelling observed in Figure 6.4.

For the future (Figures 6.5,6.6 c,f), below 300 m, in January there are no significant
changes neither in temperature nor in salinity; but in July, although overall the same
vertical structure of T and S over the slope is observed, there is a difference of roughly
0.1 in salinity at the depths of the MW. In the upper 300 m, in winter, temperatures are
0.5oC higher at deeper levels and the difference increases up to +1.5oC at the surface and
near the coast. In summer, near the coast the cross-shore gradient is clearly stronger,
and offshore in the upper 100 m temperatures are up to +2oC warmer. In what concerns
salinity, differences are more striking, from about -0.1 in winter to -0.3-0.4 in summer.
Note that at 38oN the highest negative anomalies are at the subsurface, while a saltier lens
is placed at the surface. We have observed in Figure 6.4 that at the southern WIM the
upwelling band was considerably narrower in the future.

Figures 6.7 and 6.8 present zonal vertical slices at the same sections of meridional
velocity for January and July, respectively, again for the three runs. For the present in
January, at 42oN (Figure 6.7 a,b), the ensemble shows stronger poleward flow than COADS,
consistent with what was observed in both surface fields and zonal sections of T and S.
There is also an offshore reverse in flow direction.

At 38oN (Figure 6.7 d,e), the flow patterns are similar, with weak poleward flow ten-
dency at the upper slope, some equatorward flow throughout the water column at the
400 m isobath (weaker in the ensemble than in COADS), and then poleward flow at mid-
depths corresponding to the MW flow and equatorward flow offshore, both enhanced in the
ensemble. In July (Figure 6.8), at both latitudes, the ensemble shows stronger and wider
upwelling, with velocities higher than 5 cm s?1 reaching deeper levels (400 m as opposed to
100 m in COADS). The poleward flow from the surface down to the slope between 9.5oW
and 10oW is equally strong at 38oN, but weaker at 42oN.

The differences between present and future in winter (Figure 6.7 c,f) are not very
striking. There is a more generalized tendency for poleward flow at 42oN, and at 38oN
there is a shift of the poleward flow maximum from mid-depths to the subsurface (?
10 cm s?1). In summer (Figure 6.8 c,f), although upwelling intensifies at the surface by
about 5?10 cm s?1, its width and depth decrease, seen by the more restricted equatorward
jet, reaching down to 300 m at 42oN and 100 m at 38oN in depth instead of 600 m in the
present, and also much closer to the coast. To compensate, the poleward flow occupies
most of the slope and is wider at the surface.

As suggested by Figures 6.4 and 6.6, the upwelling band is narrower and shallower in
the future, although with stronger equatorward velocities, likely due to the intensification
of the equatorward winds (Figure 6.2). This limitation in width and depth of upwelling
may be explained by the different offshore-onshore warming rates (lower temperature rise
near the coast than in the open ocean) and the consequent strengthening of the upper level
stratification. On the other hand, there is an intensification of poleward flow adjacent to
the upwelling band, especially at 42oN.

6.3.4 Seasonal Analysis

From the previous sections it becomes clear that future changes depend on the month
and also on the distance from the coast. In this section, these differences are analyzed from
a seasonal point of view, as well as a function of longitude.

Figure 6.9 presents the seasonal evolution of sea surface temperature (SST — left
column) and salinity (SSS — right column) for present and future at the five points
marked on Figure 6.1, located at the 100-m isobath. The strongest differences are observed
in winter and autumn, and the lowest during spring and summer. SST does not present
a sinusoidal-like evolution such as would be expected offshore. On the contrary, at these
points, minimum temperatures are registered between February and April, and a second
minimum is reached between June and August. The highest temperatures are observed
in autumn, when the northerly winds begin to relax after the upwelling season. These
peaks also occur in the future, although enhanced. The SST difference for months May
to August is of +1oC, while for the remaining months the difference is about +2oC. In
October at 40oN, differences reach +2.5oC, whereas at 41oN and 42oN the lowest differences
are found in August and September (0-0.5oC). Concerning SSS, the general difference
between present and future is of -0.2. Moreover, while at present the SSS minimum is
reached in July (with the exception of the 42oN section, where this minimum is observed
in September), in the future the lowest SSS is found in May for the southern sections and
also in September for the northern sections. May is the month where the future-present
difference is the highest, reaching -0.3. The May and September double low peak results
in a summer increase of salinity, which, being absent in the present series, means a lower
difference (about -0.1) between present and future for these months.

From Figure 6.9 it is evident that the temperature and salinity seasonal evolution
depend on latitude, but these variables may also depend on longitude. Hence, monthly
mean plots of SST and SSS future minus present differences along longitude are shown on
Figure 6.10, averaged along three latitudinal bands: 41-43oN, 39-41oN and 37-39oN.

In what concerns temperature, from a first observation, there is not a striking difference
between offshore/near shore locations. At the northern band (Figure 6.10 a), the general
difference is of +1 to +1.5oC. The exception is between July and September, where a
difference as low as zero can be found centered at 9.3oW, the average location of the 100-m
isobath at that latitudinal band (see Figure 6.1), where the upwelling jet is the strongest (as
discussed further on). Onshore, differences reach the highest (+2oC) difference in winter
and the lowest (+0.5oC) in summer. At the central band (Figure 6.10 c), differences are
of mostly +1.5oC except for the upwelling season (May to September), where they are in
general lower, being the lowest (&lt;0.5oC) close to the coast. Concerning the southernmost
band (Figure 6.10 e), the strongest differences are again around 9.2-9.3oW, with differences
reaching +2-3oC between August and October. The early summer interval (May-July) is
once more the one that presents the lowest SST differences (+1-1.5oC).

In what concerns salinity (Figure 6.10 b,d,f), the northern band shows strong negative
differences offshore between May and November (from -0.25 to -0.35), while near shore
during summer differences are again the lowest. At the central band, SSS differences vary

in general between -0.15 and -0.2, with differences of less than -0.1 near the coast between
June and September. Finally, at the southern band, the coastal summer low differences of
about -0.1 are displaced toward offshore longitudes.

From these observations we can draw that, despite the warmer temperatures in about
2oC and fresher waters in about 0.2 in the future, these differences are smaller near the
coast and during the upwelling season. This confirms the different SST increase between
coastal and offshore locations, responsible for strengthening of the upper layer stratification.
Nevertheless, the surface mean fields and WIM cross-sections revealed that upwelling did
not weaken, which could be expected from this increase in stratification. Furthermore, it
is interesting to note that SST and SSS strong/weak differences do not exactly correspond
in time. For instances, the coastal SST minimum differences occur in May-June, while
coastal SSS minimum differences occur in July-August.

Given these previous SST and SSS considerations concerning upwelling, and since the
latter is strongly dependent of wind stress, we look now at the upwelling index (UI). As
defined in section 3.2.1, UI is a measure of favorable or unfavorable upwelling conditions.
One of its formulations is based on the cross-shore Ekman transport derived from wind
stress (Bakun, 1973), which given the quasi-meridional orientation of the WIM, can be
considered to be solely the Ekman transport zonal component Qx, which is given by the
following equation:

Qx =
?y
?wf

(6.1)

where ?y = ?aCD|W|Wy is the meridional wind stress component (?a ? 1.22 kg m?3
is the air density, CD an adimensional drag coefficient (variable, dependent on the wind
intensity — Large and Pond, 1981), |W| is the module of the wind at 10 m, and Wy
its meridional component), ?w is the average density of seawater (? 1025 kg m?3), and
f = 2? sin(?) is the Coriolis parameter (? is the angular velocity of the Earth and ? the
latitude). UI = ?Qx is multiplied by a factor of 1000, so that the measure translates a
displacement of volume for each kilometer of coast (m3s?1km?1). UI is positive when the
Ekman transport is oriented offshore (i.e. westward) and thus upwelling-favorable, and
negative when the Ekman transport is onshore (eastward) and thus downwelling-favorable.

Figure 6.11 shows the seasonal upwelling index computed at three points along the
WIM (see Figure 6.1) for the three runs: COADS, present ensemble and future ensemble.
First of all, there is a striking difference between COADS and ensemble, with the former
presenting a double peak in April and July and the latter in July only. Also, the COADS
UI is always positive, that is, upwelling-favorable throughout the year, whereas the ensem-
ble shows a stronger seasonality, with downwelling-favorable conditions from November to
April. This was already observed in the seasonal wind stress fields (Figure 6.2). The differ-
ences between present and future are basically an enhancement toward upwelling-favorable
conditions: in autumn/winter UI is less negative, that is, less downwelling-favorable, and
in spring/summer is higher. Also, the upwelling season seems to start earlier (April instead
of May) and end later (October instead of September), at least in the southernmost point.
Note that in the northernmost point future UI equals the COADS peak for June and July

(the present ensemble UI is lower than COADS for those months), whereas in the other
points present ensemble overestimates UI in relation to COADS.

The reason for these changes is evident in the wind stress seasonal maps (Figure 6.2).
Regarding the WIM, in winter and autumn the ensemble, both present and future, show
similar patterns: southwesterly wind stress north of 39oN and westerly wind stress south
of 39oN. Thus, in these seasons UI is negative. As seen before, COADS wind stress has
always a southward component, independently of the season; hence, UI is always positive.
In summer, the increase in UI is similar for all latitudes and reflects the intensification of
the northerly wind stress seen in the seasonal fields.

6.4 Discussion

The work comprised in this chapter aimed at taking advantage of state-of-the-art cli-
mate projections and applied it to regional ocean modeling. Due to the coarse resolution
of global climate models, selecting the best model or method with respect to forcing is
difficult and debatable. Based on the sensitivity study of chapter 5, the ensemble mean of
a set of CGCMs was selected as the most adequate, because not only did it compare best
with climatological values, but also does it minimize individual uncertainties of the global
models, in spite of the loss of horizontal resolution relative to some of the CGCMs.

In agreement with the general tendencies of future climate scenarios, and in particular in
what concerns A2, the ocean off the WIM under increased greenhouse gas concentration is
found to warm as expected (e.g. Casey and Cornillon, 2001). Likewise, given the tendency
for the polar icecaps to melt or at least to become absent during the warm seasons, a
freshwater input is associated to future climate, and consequently a general decrease in the
salinity field (Gregory et al., 2005; Stouffer et al., 2006). However, in the coastal ocean,
more regional phenomena are at play and future assessments become more difficult.

Sea surface temperature and salinity change differently, depending on season, latitude
and distance to the coast. In winter, SST changes are higher at more coastal locations
than in the open ocean, especially in southwestern WIM, in agreement with the tendency
observed by Relvas et al. (2009). Conversely, SSS changes are lower onshore than offshore.

In summer, offshore waters undergo a stronger increase in temperature than coastal
waters, including the regions associated with filament generation (Cape Finisterre and
the Estremadura Promontory). Again, the southwestern coast is the onshore region with
the highest temperature increase. On the other hand, SSS maintains its winter tendency:
it presents the lowest decrease alongshore, especially around Galicia and northern WIM.
That is, SST differences tend to be higher to the south and SSS differences higher to the
north. Furthermore, nearshore, SST and SSS differences are lower during the upwelling
season than in the remaining months.

Concerning specifically the phenomenon of upwelling, there are two factors that need
to be considered when evaluating climate change impacts on these systems: the change in
wind stress and the change in the offshore-onshore SST gradient. First of all, they are not
independent from one another. Second, for a reliable assessment of wind stress change we
would need reliable future prediction of pressure systems, which have still much uncertainty
as far as numerical models are concerned (e.g. Seidel et al., 2008).

There are two possible consequences of climate change, particularly the surface air
warming, on eastern boundaries:

1) The summer over-land thermal low intensifies as a consequence of the more rapid
temperature increase over land than over ocean; hence, equatorward winds also intensify,
as well as upwelling (Bakun, 1990);

2) The general warming of the ocean increases the offshore-onshore SST gradient, typ-
ical of upwelling, thus weakening the upwelling itself.

Di Lorenzo et al. (2005) found in observations of the California Current System, for pe-
riod 1949-2000, that although upwelling-favorable winds had intensified in average during

160



summer, a general warming had also taken place in the upper 200 m. This warming, in con-
junction with the redistribution of heat carried out by the southward currents, brings about
a deepening of the thermocline and a stronger stratification. This increase in stratification
reduces the vertical transport associated with upwelling and counteracts the strengthened
upwelling-favorable winds, with the result of upwelling intensity and frequency decrease.
So, in fact, the two factors are at play, but one prevails over the other.

This might be the case of our modeling results: while a general increase in equatorward
wind stress is predicted, it is also true that, although upwelling does not undergo weak-
ening, it undergoes narrowing and shallowing of its jet, most likely due to the increase in
stratification.

Furthermore, this two-factor dynamics is possibly why observations seem contradictory,
at least for the Iberian Upwelling System, as previously mentioned. There seems to be
concordance in what concerns a general warming trend in the past decades (e.g. Ruiz-
Villarreal et al., 2008), regardless if upwelling intensity is increasing or decreasing. However,
it is not possible to draw definite conclusions on whether this warming is the cause for the
weakening of upwelling through the increase in stratification.

Moreover, there are also contradictory observations concerning wind stress in the past
decades, with some works reporting intensification of upwelling-favorable wind stress (Nara-
yan et al., 2010), which is in agreement with our results, others reporting the opposite,
especially in the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (e.g. Ruiz-Villarreal et al.,
2008), and others yet finding no change in wind stress whatsoever (Barton et al., 2013).

In this case, although we register an increase in UI, our modeling study seems to agree
with the view in which the warming of coastal waters inhibits vertical transport, thus
leading to a narrowing of the upwelling jet. However, given the coarse resolution of the
ensemble forcing and associated uncertainties, we cannot ascertain which of the factors
prevail over the other.

Previous similar modeling studies on the different upwelling systems reveal intensified
alongshore equatorward winds (Snyder et al., 2003 for the California system; Garreaud
and Falvey, 2009 for the Chilean coast; Miranda et al., 2012 for the Iberian system). These
studies conclude, from this increase, that it is very likely that upwelling will also increase
in intensity and frequency. In spite of this, our in-depth results indicate that it may
not be as direct as the latter authors postulate; as previously discussed, the warming of
coastal waters and consequent increment in stratification may in fact cause net weakening
of upwelling.

Global climate models still have much uncertainty. In this study we have tried to put
to use these state-of-the-art tools, along with a high-resolution ocean model configuration,
and build a consistent evaluation study of a future scenario applied to an upwelling sys-
tem. However, there are clear handicaps of CGCMs in reproducing the dynamics of these
systems, and in particular the Iberian Upwelling System. The most striking evidence of
this is the continuous upwelling signal along the Strait of Gibraltar reproduced by both
ensemble-forced runs, as if there were no geographic interruption. This is due to CGCM
low resolution, which also inhibits a more thorough analysis of, for instances, the wind
stress fields and wind stress curl, crucial in dictating upwelling variability.

Chapter 7

Conclusions

The purpose of this work was to develop a study of the Western Iberian Margin upper
ocean hydrography and dynamics, and to carry out not only a seasonal characterization
but also an interannual variability analysis, and to explore what the future could hold.

The basis for this study was a regional model configuration that consisted on a two-
domain nesting, designed such that the larger domain would resolve the large-scale flow
and properly introduce water masses and fluxes into the smaller, high-resolution domain
through the boundaries. The high-resolution domain would then be able to reproduce,
at once, the circulation at the shelf and at the slope, and the MW spreading, taking
into account the open ocean circulation and the strong bathymetric irregularities. This
configuration, along with a proper advection scheme that allows to avoid diapycnal mixing
errors associated with ?-coordinate models, was found suitable to achieve the proposed
objectives, and allowed to study the WIM mean circulation (chapter 2), its interannual
variability (chapter 3), larvae connectivity patterns (chapter 4), and finally possible future
implications in the context of a climate change scenario (chapter 6), as well as the sensitivity
of global climate models in forcing such a scenario (chapter 5).

From chapter 2 it became clear that the WIM is characterized by a complex oceanic
system, with both strong interannual variability and marked seasonal cycles. The mean
circulation results from the interaction of three main phenomena: coastal upwelling, the
Iberian Poleward Current and Mediterranean Water outflow through the Strait of Gibral-
tar. The region dynamics is also influenced by large-scale phenomena such as the eastward
extension of the Azores Current, the structure of the meridional density gradients, or the
less energetic offshore, equatorward Portugal Current. Furthermore, small-scale localized
phenomena such as the exchange of waters through the Strait of Gibraltar, which spreads
throughout the Eastern North Atlantic, or river inflow, particularly at the surface lay-
ers and along the continental shelf, also play a role in the system’s dynamics. The most
important results drawn from this chapter are the following:

• The WIM mean circulation presents a tendency for poleward flow along the slope of
the WIM, although with some evidences of equatorward flow mostly in spring;

• Wind-forced upwelling-driven equatorward flow is observed along the continental

163



shelf in summer, in coexistence with poleward flow offshore;

• The main paths of poleward flow appear to be linked to the MW vein along the WIM
(barotropic character);

Furthermore, a Lagrangian application was carried out over this climatological run with
the purpose of assessing the origin of the waters that upwell along the WIM during summer.
The experimental set was a back-in-time deployment of Lagrangian particles, that is, the
points of departure were four bands along the WIM at the ocean subsurface (upwelling
region) and particles travelled back 30 days to see where they had originated from. Here
are some remarks in what concerns the origin of upwelled waters along the WIM:

• There is a higher number of upwelling particles coming from the north and from the
upper 100 m (the main pathway of the upwelling equatorward jet);

• The shallower they upwell, the shallower their origin is;

• The particles that travel the longest distances originate at the shallowest depths, and
vice-versa;

• The particles that come from the deepest levels trace trajectories the closest to the
coast;

• The particles that have origins the farthest away from their upwelling spots (and
hence the shallowest origins and trajectories closest to the coast) seem more depen-
dent on the equatorward jet, while particles that originate closer to the coast (and
hence at deeper levels and from offshore) seem modulated by mesoscale activity.

With chapter 3, the intention was to broaden the climatological view of chapter 2 and
extend it to an interannual study of the WIM dynamics. First, a description of a 45-year
long (1967-2011) upwelling index dataset was carried out, in an attempt to characterize
the mean wind conditions and their variability. Then, using an 11-year (2001-2011) ROMS
simulation, an analysis of anomalous years was attempted, based on SST, wind stress, and
salinity and surface velocity profiles. First of all, ROMS was able to reproduce reasonably
well the SST anomalies for the entire study period, as well as temperature and salinity
profiles given by Argo floats and surface currents for the one year and a half period available
in observations. Secondly, a characterization of particular events of high/low salinities
and/or strong alongshore velocities was carried out. We successfully identified episodes of
S-N saline water advection, and found evidence of the poleward flow offshore shift during
summer, in the presence of upwelling. Furthermore, many of these modeled events have
correspondence with observational studies in the literature.

Making use of this interannual study, chapter 4 was a Lagrangian application over the
same ROMS run for period 2001-2011 with realistic forcing, in order to compute some
generic larvae connectivity aspects of SD. Two simulations were carried out: one with diel
vertical motion (DVM), and one without. In doing so, the purpose was to check the role of

164



this diurnal/nocturnal migration of larvae in the supply and recruitment along the WIM,
in equally-spaced adjacent regions with equal areas. These were the main conclusions
reached:

• Wind stress direction plays an important role: in the occurrence of poleward events,
the direction of supply is mainly to the north, whereas when equatorward wind
prevails supply is carried out in both directions;

• The Estremadura Promontory works as a geographical gap between northern and
southern WIM, consisting in a natural obstacle for supply from the south.

• Supply is strongly influenced by topography: in the presence of pronounced features
such as capes, promontories and general uneven coastline, retention is higher, whereas
in regions where the coastline is roughly linear it is where the most successful sources
are located;

• In the simulation with DVM, retention increases throughout the domain (dispersal
distances are greater) and supply to the south increases significantly, due to the lesser
offshore advection once the particles are not subject to Ekman transport.

Having in mind an ocean modeling essay applied to a future climate scenario, chapter 5
comprised an evaluation of several global climate models (GCM) as forcing for ROMS for
present conditions. The chapter was divided in two parts: the first consisted in a GCM
inter-comparison regarding all variables needed to force ROMS, where difference fields were
analyzed, as well as seasonal averages and RMSEs; in the second part, two of these GCMs
served as forcing for two ROMS runs aiming at a sensitivity assessment. The ultimate goal
was to find the most suitable GCM to reproduce the present climatological atmospheric
and ocean conditions at the surface. No GCM was found to be perfect in what concerns
every variable; they all had strengths and weaknesses. The main conclusion was that the
multi-model ensemble mean (GCM climatological average) would be the most appropriate
forcing among the GCM dataset.

After this assessment on the uncertainties of global climate models in reproducing the
present hydrography and dynamics of the WIM, and based on that conclusion, in chapter 6
SD was forced with a future climatology. Besides the general warming of the ocean surface
and subsurface (although varying in longitude and latitude) due to the increase in the
surface air temperature, expected by every future climate scenario, a general decrease in
salinity brought about by melting of ice in the poles was also found. Furthermore, although
global climate models typically expect, for eastern boundary systems, strengthening of the
alongshore equatorward winds and hence upwelling, the results do not show such a clear
outcome. Indeed, as a consequence of a higher warming rate of the ocean temperature
offshore than onshore, the SST cross-shore gradient intensifies, strengthening stratifica-
tion, which inhibits vertical motion. As a result, the upwelling-associated equatorward jet
intensifies, but the upwelling coastal band of colder and fresher waters is more restricted
in width and depth, suggesting that both mechanisms are at play. The following main
conclusions were drawn from this study:

165



• There is a general temperature increase and salinity decrease, particularly in the
upper 100-200 m;

• Winter: SST increase is higher onshore and SSS decrease is higher offshore;

• Summer: SST increase is higher offshore and SSS decrease is higher offshore;

• There is strengthening of the SST offshore-onshore gradient, and thus of stratification;

• In spite of meridional wind stress intensification in summer, there is narrowing and
shallowing of the upwelling jet, although at the surface there may be an equatorward
velocity increase.

These high-resolution ROMS configurations, which have also been successfully imple-
mented in operational mode (http://climetua.fis.ua.pt/fields/oceanoAtlantic/templ1) and
in biogeochemical studies (Reboreda et al., submitted, in review), enabled a study en-
compassing seasonality, mean behavior, interannual variability, future changes, and larval
dispersion considerations. Overall, I believe this work constitutes a relevant contribution in
the understanding of the Iberian Upwelling System, addressing important physical aspects
of the coastal transition zone.
