Resumo 

A população mundial tem vindo a crescer exponencialmente nos últimos 100 anos, maioritariamente 

nos países em desenvolvimento como a China ou a India. Estas populações continuam a usar o 

petróleo como fonte primária de combustível, esperando-se por isso um aumento da procura de 

11,25% até 2035 (OPEC 2013). A descoberta da tecnologia necessária para a extração de crude de 

zonas de difícil perfuração revolucionou o mercado da energia, diminuindo o preço do barril de 

petróleo até valores históricos (U.S Energy Informaton Administration 2014). Contudo, crudes 

extraídos destes novos poços possuem na sua composição grandes quantidades de compostos de 

enxofre e outros contaminantes cuja remoção é extremamente complicada, sendo designados 

“crudes pesados”. A combustão dos petróleos e derivados leva à libertação destes compostos, para 

a atmosfera, podendo causar diversos problemas ambientais e de saúde. Desta forma, é imperativa 

a sua remoção, sendo que diversos países, tais como os Estados Unidos da América, a China e os 

países pertencentes à União Europeia, começaram a legislar de modo a restringirem a quantidade 

de enxofre presente nos produtos petrolíferos, exigindo a criação do chamado “ultra-low sulfur oil” 

(OPEC 2014).  

Hoje em dia, o processo utilizado nas refinarias para a remoção de enxofre dos crudes é a 

hidrodessulfurização (HDS). Este processo consiste na utilização de altas temperaturas e pressões 

e catalisadores de última geração para remover os compostos de enxofre. Contudo, compostos como 

o dibenzotiofeno (DBT), que são os grandes contribuidores para o enxofre presente nos crudes, são 

altamente recalcitrantes a este processo, uma vez que a molécula de enxofre se encontra rodeada 

por dois anéis benzénicos. Para a remoção destes compostos, a indústria desenvolveu a HDS 

profunda. Esta utiliza temperaturas e pressões mais elevadas que a HDS e catalisadores mais 

eficientes sendo também menos ecológica e mais dispendiosa (Klein 1999). 

Existe no entanto uma alternativa biológica à HDS profunda, a biodessulfurização (BDS). Esta é um 

processo biotecnológico equivalente à HDS, uma vez que remove o enxofre de compostos 

complexos. Nas últimas décadas, a BDS tem vindo a atrair atenções, visto que tem a capacidade de 

processar os combustíveis fósseis de uma forma amiga do ambiente. Esta dá-se a temperaturas e 

pressões iguais às ambientais e é efetuada por microrganismos que têm a capacidade de metabolizar 

compostos de enxofre (Soleimani et al. 2007; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2011).  

Neste estudo foi utilizada a bactéria Gordonia alkanivorans estirpe 1B. As espécies do género 

Gordonia são bastante atrativas para usos biotecnológicos, uma vez que, têm a capacidade de 

degradar inúmeros poluentes ambientais, tais como hidrocarbonetos policíclicos aromáticos, 

alquilpiridinas, xenobióticos ou polímeros naturais. Têm também a capacidade de transformar ou 

sintetizar compostos orgânicos (transformação de esteroides e produção de carotenoides) (Linos et 

al. 1999; Harner et al. 2011; Grace Liu et al. 2011). A estirpe 1B já tinha sido descrita como tendo a 



 
 

capacidade de converter DBT em 2-HBP (2-hidroxibifenil) por Alves et al. (2005). Foi igualmente 

demonstrado, por Alves (2007), que a bactéria em questão possui, à semelhança de Rodococcus 

erythropolis (uma espécie até então muito utilizada em ensaios de dessulfurização), um operão dsz, 

composto pelos genes dszA, dszB e dszC que codificam as proteínas necessárias para que a célula 

consiga dessulfurizar. Alves &amp;amp; Paixão (2014b) identificaram também outra característica metabólica 

interessante na estirpe 1B, nomeadamente o fato de esta crescer preferencialmente utilizando 

frutose como fonte de carbono.  

Este comportamento é raro em bactérias, contudo abriu uma nova linha de investigação em que se 

deu prioridade à pesquisa de fontes de carbono alternativas, ricas em frutose (nomeadamente 

resíduos agroindustriais), tais como melaço de cana, medronho, alfarroba ou tubérculos de 

tupinambo (Silva 2012; Silva et al. 2012; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014a; Silva et al. 2015). Todas estas fontes 

de carbono alternativas produziram melhores resultados de dessulfurização quando comparadas 

com fontes ricas em glucose, contudo, o sumo de tupinambo (JAJ) foi o melhor, de entre as fontes 

alternativas ricas em frutose testadas (Silva 2012). Os tubérculos de tupinambo são ricos em inulina, 

um frutano linear composto por um número variável de moléculas de frutose unidas por ligações          

? (2 ?1) com uma molécula de glucose no final, ligada à cadeia de frutoses por uma ligação                   

? (1 ? 2). A inulina é solúvel em água e pode ser facilmente hidrolisada (através de hidrólise ácida 

ou enzimática), libertando frutose (até 95%) e glucose (Silva 2012; Paixão et al. 2013). Por estas 

razões, o JAJ foi escolhido como a fonte de carbono alternativa a ser utilizada neste trabalho. 

Sendo que a BDS é mais eficiente e menos dispendiosa que a HDS profunda, pode ser utilizada nas 

refinarias como um complemento à HDS de maneira a produzir combustíveis com muito baixo teor 

de enxofre (Alves et al. 2015). Quando implementada, esta técnica vai diminuir os problemas 

ambientais levantados pela HDS, reduzindo a emissão de CO2, a produção de resíduos e o consumo 

de energia. Tudo isto se traduz em menos capital investido (dois terços do capital necessário para a 

HDS) e menos custos operacionais (Vazquez-Duhalt et al. 2002; Alves et al. 2015). O processo de 

BDS pode ainda beneficiar da produção simultânea de produtos de alto valor acrescentado, que 

podem ser valorizados através de outros processos industriais (De Miguel et al. 2000; De Miguel et 

al. 2001; Veiga-Crespo et al. 2012; Bandyopadhyay &amp;amp; Chowdhury 2014).  

Este trabalho, teve como objetivo principal a minimização do meio de cultura utilizado para o 

crescimento da bactéria Gordonia alkanivorans estirpe 1B (meio mínimo sem sulfatos/meio SFM). 

Para isso, avaliou-se quais os componentes do meio mais importantes para o crescimento e 

desenvolvimento celular, tendo sido selecionados para minimização a fonte de azoto (NH4Cl), a fonte 

de magnésio (MgCl2.6H20) e a solução de micronutrientes (TES), primeiro em frasco agitado e de 

seguida em cultura em contínuo. 



 
 

O azoto (N) é um grande interveniente no crescimento celular e um dos nutrientes necessários à vida 

como a conhecemos. Faz parte da composição de aminoácidos, ácidos nucleicos e 

enzimas/coenzimas e no meio mínimo utilizado para crescer a bactéria G. alkanivorans é o nutriente 

utilizado em maior concentração (1,22 g.l-1), sem contar com a fonte de carbono (Singh 1971; Alves 

et al. 2015). Portanto, para minimizar a quantidade de fonte de azoto foram testadas diversas 

formulações do SFM com concentrações decrescentes de NH4Cl (F#1 – 100%, F#2 – 75%, F#3 – 

50% e F#4 – 25%). Os resultados obtidos mostraram que o crescimento foi grandemente afetado 

tanto com F#4 como com F#3. Nestes dois casos não houve consumo total dos açúcares fornecidos, 

provando que a quantidade de azoto era insuficiente. Contudo, com F#2, a curva de crescimento foi 

semelhante à produzida pelo controlo F#1, ocorrendo o consumo total dos açúcares.  

No que toca à dessulfurização, quando crescida com a F#1, a cultura conseguiu obter uma taxa 

máxima específica de produção de 2-HBP (q2-HBP) de 2,5 µmol.g
-1(peso seco).h-1, com consumo total 

do DBT fornecido. Mas, com a diminuição da concentração de azoto, a q2-HBP foi também 

decrescendo, atingindo um valor de 2,4 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 no crescimento com F#2;                      

2,3 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 no crescimento com F#3; e 1,4 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 no crescimento 

com F#4. Nestas três condições testadas não ocorreu o consumo total do DBT fornecido, indicando 

que a concentração de azoto utilizada não foi suficiente. Contudo, o facto de o crescimento ter 

ocorrido normalmente com a F#2 indica que esta está muito próxima da concentração mínima 

necessária à célula, portanto 75%&amp;lt;fonte de N mínima&amp;lt;100%.  

Quanto ao magnésio (Mg), este foi escolhido como um dos elementos do meio a minimizar pois é 

essencial à divisão celular e é um interveniente especialmente importante para bactérias gram-

positivas, uma vez que faz parte da estrutura do peptidoglicano (Webb 1939). Ao testar-se 

concentrações decrescentes de MgCl2.6H20 (F#1 – 100%; F#5 – 75%; F#6 – 50%; F#7 – 25%), foi 

possível observar que não houve alterações significativas nem no perfil de crescimento (sendo a 

absorvância a 600 nm (OD600nm) semelhante para todas as formulações testadas), nem no consumo 

de açúcares. Contudo, em termos de dessulfurização, verificou-se um comportamento interessante. 

A diminuição da concentração de magnésio levou a um aumento significativo da q2-HBP de                      

2,5 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 (F#1) para 2,8 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 (F#5); 3,0 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 

(F#6); e 3,4 µmol.g-1(peso seco).h-1 (F#7). Este resultado indica que o magnésio pode inibir, de certa 

forma, a dessulfurização, de tal modo que a diminuição da concentração utilizada faz com que esta 

aumente significativamente. 

O último componente do meio testado foi a solução de micronutrientes (TES). Esta solução é 

composta por minerais como ferro, zinco, molibdénio, manganésio ou cobalto (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 

2014b). Estes micronutrientes fazem parte da estrutura das proteínas celulares e funcionam muitas 

vezes como cofatores (Majzlik et al. 2011; Kirsch &amp;amp; Eitinger 2014). Neste caso, as concentrações 



 
 

testadas anteriormente (F#8 – 75%, F#9 – 50% e F#10 – 25%) não foram suficientes para se observar 

diferenças quer no crescimento, quer no consumo de açúcares, quer em termos de dessulfurização. 

Testaram-se então concentrações mais baixas, nomeadamente, 5% (F#11), 2,5% (F#12) e 0% 

(F#13). Com estas concentrações já foi possível observar alterações nos parâmetros avaliados. Com 

F#11, as células foram capazes de consumir toda a fonte de carbono fornecida, contudo, só o fizeram 

após 118 horas de crescimento. Relativamente às restantes concentrações, verificou-se que não 

houve conclusão do crescimento visto não ter ocorrido o consumo total da fonte de carbono. Quanto 

à dessulfurização, o consumo total do DBT foi atingido em todos os frascos, exceto na ausência de 

TES. Para F#8, F#9 e F#10, a q2-HBP foi mais elevada que o controlo, sendo que nas restantes 

concentrações testadas foi quase duas vezes mais baixa. 

A informação obtida nos diferentes ensaios em frasco agitado permitiu a minimização das 

concentrações dos três componentes essenciais presentes na formulação original do meio, sem 

afetar negativamente o crescimento celular e ainda melhorando a dessulfurização. Estes resultados 

permitiram desenvolver o meio SFM minimizado, ao qual se denominou “meio SFMM”, consistindo 

em 85% N (estipulado através de uma extrapolação baseada nos resultados do consumo de 

açúcares e desulfurização), 25% Mg e 25% TES. De seguida, o meio SFMM e o meio SFM foram 

testados com duas fontes de carbono distintas: frutose + glucose e JAJ precipitado (JAJp). Em geral, 

estes ensaios demostraram que, independentemente da fonte de carbono utilizada, a utilização do 

meio minimizado (meio SFMM) aumentou a dessulfurização pela estirpe 1B, em comparação com o 

respetivo controlo (meio SFM).  

Este facto foi de encontro ao esperado, uma vez que a minimização do Mg e do TES fez com que a 

q2-HBP fosse mais elevada. A estirpe 1B foi capaz de crescer normalmente no meio minimizado e não 

foram observados efeitos de sinergia negativos entre os compostos do meio. Comparando os 

resultados por fonte de carbono é possível observar, no entanto, que para ambos os meios (SFM e 

SFMM), as taxas máximas de crescimento (µmax) e a dessulfurização (q2-HBP) foram mais baixas 

quando o JAJp foi utilizado como fonte de carbono. Isto pode ser o resultado de um efeito inibitório 

causado pelo cloreto de bário utilizado durante a precipitação dos sulfatos. 

Para a BDS ser integrada nas refinarias, a produção de biomassa deverá ocorrer num quimiostato 

trabalhando em modo contínuo (Pacheco 1999). Este sistema tem a vantagem de permitir o controlo 

total sobre diversos parâmetros da cultura, tais como a temperatura, a agitação, o pH, o arejamento 

e a velocidade a que o meio de cultura entra no quimiostato. Tendo isto em conta, o passo seguinte 

consistiu na adaptação do SFMM (anteriormente otimizado em frasco agitado) para uso em 

quimiostato. Sendo que este trabalho tem como base a minimização de custos do processo, foi 

igualmente desenvolvido um quimiostato de baixo custo. Neste, foi efetuado um “screening” à 



 
 

concentração de azoto, uma vez que tinha ficado estipulado no ensaio de frasco que a concentração 

ótima seria um valor entre 75-100%. 

Tal como foi observado no ensaio em frasco agitado, os parâmetros analisados foram melhores com 

o aumento da concentração de azoto. Ensaios de citometria de fluxo foram efetuados de modo a 

perceber o estado fisiológico das células crescidas com as diferentes concentrações de azoto. Foi 

possível observar que com menos de 100% de azoto, a percentagem de células com a membrana 

comprometida aumenta, sendo que as percentagens de células metabolicamente inativas ou mortas 

mantêm-se constantes. Um dos parâmetros que pode ser utilizado para calcular a concentração 

ótima de NH4Cl é a taxa de produção de biomassa (BPR). Fazendo uma regressão polinomial da 

BPR = f (concentração de N) foi possível interpolar que 90% seria a concentração mais acertada, 

uma vez que o valor da BPR foi muito semelhante ao obtido com o 100%. 

Desenhado o meio SFMM para quimiostato (meio SFMMR), consistindo em 90% N, 25% Mg e 25% 

TES, este foi testado com duas fontes de carbono: frutose + glucose versus JAJ para a produção de 

biocatalizadores. A taxa de diluição foi de 0,065 h-1 para crescimentos com fontes comerciais e 0,045 

h-1 para crescimentos com JAJ (fonte alternativa de carbono), com base nos resultados previamente 

obtidos em frasco agitado. Comparando os dados metabólicos das duas culturas em estado 

estacionário SS#5 e SS#6 (SS#5 – SFMMR + (Frutose + Glucose); SS#6 – SFMMR + JAJ 

concentrado/JAJc), é possível observar que a cultura SS#5 apresenta uma produção de biomassa 

(3,97 g.l-1) superior à da cultura SS#6 (3,10 g.l-1), sendo estes resultados consistentes com os 

restantes parâmetros metabólicos associados ao crescimento (OD600nm, biomassa, taxa de produção 

de biomassa, taxas de consumo de açúcares, qFru, qGlu). Contudo, esta diferença de 1,7 vezes pode 

estar associada às diferenças na taxa de diluição, sendo que, no SS#5 foi 0,065 h-1 e no SS#6 foi de 

0,045 h-1 o que pode levar à produção de células metabolicamente mais ativas. Quanto aos 

resultados obtidos para a recuperação de carbono (CR), a eficiência da conversão de carbono (CCE) 

e o rendimento celular (Yx/s), verificou-se que são muito semelhantes para ambas as culturas, 

demonstrando um comportamento similar das células crescidas no meio minimizado, apesar da 

utilização de uma fonte de carbono diferente. O meio SFMMR também permitiu o consumo total da 

fonte de carbono (e por consequência de todos os nutrientes do meio) em ambas as culturas SS, 

permitindo obter um q2-HBP de 2,90 µmol.g
-1(peso seco).h-1 para o SS#5 e um q2-HBP de                         

12,23 µmol.g
-1(peso seco).h-1 para o SS#6, sendo este último 4 vezes superior ao obtido com o meio 

SFMMR com a fonte de carbono comercial (Frutose + Glucose).  

Os resultados obtidos recorrendo à citometria de fluxo demonstraram que em ambos os SS, as 

células se encontram maioritariamente saudáveis, sendo a percentagem de células viáveis 

aproximadamente 93% tanto para a cultura SS#5, como para a cultura SS#6. Desta forma, os 

resultados metabólicos e fisiológicos apontam para as células da cultura SS#6 (SFMMR + JAJc) como 



 
 

sendo os biocatalizadores otimizados e mais eficientes em termos de custos e em termos de 

produtividade (biodessulfurização). A taxa de dessulfurização obtida com este meio foi igualmente 

2,4 vezes superior à obtida por Silva (2012) utilizando células da estirpe 1B crescidas em JAJp                                

(q2-HBP = 5,06 µmol.g
-1(peso seco).h-1). 

Para melhor compreender as diferenças observadas em termos de dessulfurização, utilizou-se a 

técnica de PCR em tempo real para analisar a expressão dos genes dszA, dszB e dszC. Analisando 

os resultados observou-se uma grande diminuição na expressão dos genes dszB e dszA no caso da 

cultura SS#5 (SFMMR + Frutose + Glucose), em comparação com a cultura SS#6 (SFMMR + JAJc). 

Estes resultados podem explicar a diferença entre taxas de dessulfurização, uma vez que a 

expressão dos genes necessários à via não está a ocorrer na mesma proporção. 

Numa refinaria, as células de G. alkanivorans estirpe 1B vão ter que dessulfurizar petróleo, que é 

rico em diferentes espécies de tiofenos (onde está incluído o DBT). À escala laboratorial, o crude 

pode ser mimetizado utilizando uma mistura de tiofenos dissolvidos num solvente orgânico 

(combustível modelo). Desta forma testou-se o desempenho de células provenientes do quimiostato, 

crescidas com SFMMR + JAJc (cultura SS#6), a dessulfurizar um combustível modelo. Os resultados 

obtidos indicam que as células foram capazes de dessulfurizar 500 µM de uma mistura de DBT e 

derivados de DBT em apenas 72 h, sendo que ao final deste tempo já só são observáveis os produtos 

da dessulfurização.  

De modo a viabilizar economicamente todo este processo é necessário aproveitar produtos 

secundários que a célula possa produzir. No caso da bactéria utlizada neste estudo, durante o 

crescimento, são produzidos pigmentos (entre outros produtos secundários) que podem ser 

aproveitados após a dessulfurização. Neste contexto, os pigmentos produzidos pela estirpe 1B foram 

extraídos de células de ambos os crescimentos em quimiostato (culturas SS#5 e SS#6), antes e após 

a dessulfurização. Após a sua identificação em HPLC, observou-se que os pigmentos obtidos são 

principalmente da família dos carotenoides, sendo que dos vários picos observados, houve 

correspondência para a astaxantina, luteína e cantaxantina. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que 

as células exaustas (SS#5-postBDS; SS#6-postBDS) produziram maiores quantidades dos 

carotenoides identificados (luteína, astaxantina e cantaxantina) do que as células frescas              

(SS#5-preBDS; SS#6-postBDS). A luteína foi o carotenoide mais abundante, tanto para as células 

pré-dessulfurização como para as células pós-dessulfurização de ambos os estados estacionários. 

Estes resultados também demonstraram um perfil de carotenoides diferente para as células 

produzidas no SS#5 e no SS#6. As células produzidas no SS#5-postBDS atingiram uma produção 

total de pigmentos de 265 µg.g-1(peso seco), enquanto que as células produzidas no SS#6 obtiveram 

uma produção total de pigmentos de 334 µg.g-1(peso seco). Como a dessulfurização do DBT 

melhorou a produção generalizada de todos os pigmentos, a exploração destes produtos de alto 



 
 

valor acrescentado a partir das células exaustas pode estar associada ao processo de 

biodessulfurização, como um fator determinante ao seu equilíbrio económico (Paixão et al. 2016). 

A biodessulfurização é um passo importante para tornar o processo de tratamento de crudes um 

pouco mais ecológico e amigo do ambiente. Este trabalho permitiu a redução dos componentes do 

meio de cultura necessário para o crescimento da estirpe 1B e levando ao aumento da capacidade 

de dessulfurização dos biocatalizadores utilizados na biodessulfurização de combustíveis fósseis e 

à redução do custo associado à sua produção.

Abstract 

Biodesulfurization is an eco-friendly process for the production of ultra-low sulfur fuels. Optimization 

studies towards the integration of this technology in a petroleum refinery are an important focus of 

research. The main goal of this study consisted on the minimization of the sulfur free mineral (SFM) 

medium for the maximum production of efficient desulfurizing biocatalysts (Gordonia alkanivorans 

active cells) taking into account the lowest operational costs. In this context, a series of assays, first 

in shake-flask and then in chemostat, were carried out to develop and optimize a culture medium 

containing minimal amounts of Nitrogen and Magnesium sources and TES (trace elements solution). 

The shake-flask minimization assays allowed the design of a SFMM (SFM minimum) medium 

containing 75-100% Nitrogen source, 25% Magnesium source and 25% TES, which permitted 

enhanced desulfurization in comparison with control medium (SFM). This combined reduction was 

then applied to the SFM reactor medium and the culture conditions were optimized in chemostat 

assays. After screening for the minimal amount of Nitrogen source using a low-cost bioreactor, the 

established SFMMR (SFMM reactor) medium  was 90% NH4Cl, 25% MgCl2 and 25% TES. This 

SFMMR medium was tested in two additional continuous cultures and adjusted in order to obtain the 

maximum yield of biocatalysts (strain 1B resting cells). The use of Jerusalem artichoke juice 

concentrate as the single carbon source caused a 4-fold increase in desulfurization capability of the 

biocatalysts (maximum specific 2-hidroxybiphenyl production rate = 12.2 µmol.g-1(dry cell weight).h-

1). These results were consistent with the Real Time-PCR analysis, which showed a higher expression 

of the overall desulfurization genes (dszA, dszB, dszC) in these biocatalysts. Furthermore, these 

biocatalysts were also capable of total desulfurization of a model oil, with the exhausted biomass 

producing 334 ?g.g-1(dry cell weight) of high added-value carotenoids, highlighting their potential 

towards a cost-effective industrial scale-up.

2013, OPEC). 

1. Introduction 

1.1. World energy demand 

The worldwide population has been increasing exponentially for the last 100 years from 2 to 7.3 billion 

and is expected to grow up to 8.6 billion in 2035 (OPEC 2014). Most of this growth is predicted to 

occur in India, China and other developing countries. As shown in Figure 1, these nations have grown 

economically and financially during the last 35 years, changing from mostly agricultural populations 

to great urban communities (more than 1.6 billion by 2035).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Such changes are leading to higher energy needs to support not only the developed industry but also 

the highly demanding lifestyles of these populations. Forecasts predict a 52% increase of energy 

demand from 2010 to 2035 (Figure 2). Most of this energy will be of fossil fuel origin (80%), with the 

largest share, coming from oil (26 to 27%). Oil demand will experience an average increase of                      

0.9 mb.d-1 (million barrels per day) until 2018 and 20 mb.d-1 until 2035, which translates in a demand 

increase of 3.8% and 11.25%, respectively (OPEC 2013). 

1.2. The importance of oil 

With the emergence of hybrid and non-petroleum-based engines, it was expected that oil consumption 

would decrease drastically. However, this effect was only observed in developed countries where 

alternative energy sources are well established and the population economic power allows access to 

these new technologies. In developing countries the demand for cheaper, reliable and comfortable 

means of transportation is high, so vehicles with internal combustion engines are the preferred choice.

coke, waxes, till gas, sulfur, direct use of crude oil, etc (Adapted from World Oil Outlook, 2014, OPEC). 

For example, it is expected that China will have an increase of 380 million vehicles until 2035 (OPEC 

2013). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Even with its high energy demand, most oil reserves are found in countries where the socio-political 

scenario is unstable, resulting in great price variation. This fact, coupled with the non-renewable 

nature of fossil fuel and the consequent depletion of its reserves, has led to a worldwide search for 

an acceptable replacement (OPEC 2014). Biofuels, such as biodiesel, biogas and bioethanol are 

considered by many as an alternative. Much research has been conducted throughout the world in 

the last decades concerning biofuels, however, there are still several drawbacks which limit their short 

term utility. The competition for resources used in human and animal feed, the fact that their 

production in high quantities is expensive and laborious and that there are still problems with transport 

and storing are some of these drawbacks/obstacles (Atabani et al. 2012). Table 1 enumerates a list 

of more particular problems that these technologies are currently facing.  

The discovery of the technology necessary to remove oil from difficult-to-drill sites, such as shale 

formations or oil sands has revolutionized the energy market bringing oil prices to an historical low.  

With its relatively cheap operational costs and almost instant investment return, the use of this new 

technology is resulting in a high flux of oil into the international markets (U.S Energy Informaton 

Administration 2014; OPEC 2014). Moreover, the use of these shale formations allowed countries 

that used to be consumers to become producers (U.S Energy Informaton Administration 2014), driving 

away some of the production from the unstable regions, and greatly increasing the reserves available. 

Ultimately, these recent changes in the market have made oil re-emerge as a cheap and easily 

available energy source.

Bond &amp;amp; Templeton 2011; Atabani et al. 2012; Sánchez-Segado et al. 2012; Lima-Costa et al. 2012) 

 

1.3. The impact of sulfur in oil quality and environment 

The combustion of fossil fuels releases many hazardous components such as CO2, NOx, SOx and 

other sulfur compounds. Sulfur is a major component of crude oil, along with carbon and hydrogen, 

ranging from 0.03 to 7.89 % (g.g-1), and between 500 and 5000 mg.l-1 in the distillate fraction used to 

make diesel oil (Soleimani et al. 2007; Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008). High viscosity and density crudes (such 

as shale oils) tend to have higher sulfur concentrations (3.09 % (g.g-1), especially in its organic forms 

(e.g. sulfides and thiophenic compounds, represented in Figure 3) that can account for 75% of total 

sulfur. Some of these are very recalcitrant, because the sulfur is enclosed within an aromatic ring. 

This configuration makes its removal increasingly more difficult.  

Due to the presence of sulfur compounds in their composition, the combustion of oils may cause 

several health and environmental problems. High concentrations of sulfur in diesel oils increase the 

formation of diesel particulate matter (DPM), which has been classified as carcinogenic by several 

Biodiesel 

? Has 12% less energy content than diesel, resulting in a 2 to 10% increase of fuel consumption.  
? Has a higher cloud and pour points. 
? Has higher nitrogen oxide emissions than diesel. 
? Has lower volatilities, causing the formation of deposits in engines (due to incomplete combustion 

characteristics). 
? Causes excessive carbon deposition and gum formation. 
? Has higher viscosity (11–18 times diesel), thus needing higher injector pressure. 
? Its oxidation stability is lower than that of diesel, thus losing calorific power. 
? Produces lower engine speed and power. 
? Has high price, causes high engine wear and engine incompatibility. 
? Requires expensive fatty acid separation or use of less effective (or expensive) acid catalysts. 
? The transesterification has some environmental effects such as waste disposal and water requirement 

for washing, soap formation, etc. 
? The high temperatures in the transesterification, incomplete conversion and the variability of the 

incoming feedstock increases the end-product price. 

Bioethanol 

? The blend of bioethanol with gasoline has to take place right before its use. 
? Is higroscopic (miscible with water), which causes ignition problems. 
? Automobile engines need to be modified to be run on a blend containing 5 (E5, Europe) to 10% (E10, 

North America) bioethanol. 
? Has over 30% less energy than gasoline, low flame luminosity and lower vapor pressure than gasoline 

(making cold starts difficult). 
? Low levels of ethanol blended with gasoline increases vapor pressure and favor evaporative emissions 

that contribute to smog formation. 
? The biomass pre-treatment process has been proven to be unsuitable due to high costs, low yields, 

produced waste and undesired by-products. 

Biomethane/ 

Biohydrogen 

? Has transportation and utilization problems (fuel cell vehicles are not commercially available yet and a 
distribution infrastructure for hydrogen cannot be assembled in the short term). 

? Has storage problems (biohydrogen has to be compressed, liquefied, or stored in metal hydrides). 
? The production is associated to the generation and emission of CO2 and N2O.

regulatory and research agencies, such as the U.S Environmental Protection Agency. DPM related 

air pollution can also cause bronchial irritation and asthma attacks in susceptible individuals. 

Thiophene compounds present in fossil fuels, as dibenzothiophene (DBT), have also been proven to 

be toxic to several species of mammals. The incomplete burning of sulfur rich oil can produce high 

concentrations of SO2, which reacts with water in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of sulfuric 

acid, the main component of acid rains. Sulfur can also be a hindrance to pollution preventing 

mechanisms, such as catalytic converters seen in automobiles, preventing their complete function 

and decreasing their efficiency ( Lloyd &amp;amp; Cackette 2001; Maricq et al. 2002; Saiyasitpanich et al. 2005; 

Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008) .  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a response to the increasing concern with the environmental and health problems related with the 

sulfur levels in fossil fuels, countries have begun to implement strict sulfur concentration limits. In a 

time span of 7 years, the USA lowered the legal limit from 3400 to 30 ppm for all refineries and, up to 

2018, all northeastern states refineries will have adopted&amp;lt;15 ppm of sulfur content oil (U.S Energy 

Informaton Administration 2014). Since 2009, EU countries have stipulated that all gasoline and on-

road diesel must be limited to 10 ppm of sulfur content, and later in 2011 this limit was applied to all 

types of off-road diesels as well (OPEC 2011). As already stated, China and India are the largest 

contributors for the world population increase. Confronted with alarming levels of pollution, these 

countries followed the USA and EU directives and started to implement stricter oil regulations. China 

has limited the legal sulfur concentration nationwide to 150 ppm, having stricter laws for Beijing, 

Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, where the limit was established at 50 ppm. India has also

lowered its legal limit to 150 ppm sulfur gasoline nationwide and restricted to 50 ppm in 13 selected 

cities with large vehicle populations and high pollution levels (OPEC 2014).  

Furthermore, it has to be expected that the sulfur level in on-road and off-road gasoline and diesel 

requirements will become stricter in the foreseeable future towards ultra-low sulfur fuels, approaching 

zero sulfur emissions from burned fuels. Therefore, the efficiency of the desulfurization technologies 

becomes a key point (Alves et al. 2015). 

1.4. Hydrodesulfurization 

Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is the most commonly used industrial process for the removal of sulfur 

compounds from crude oil and refined petroleum products. As shown in Figure 4, this process 

consists in the use of hydrogen to convert organic sulfur into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is easily 

removed. It combines high pressure and temperature (150 – 3000 psi; 250 – 455°C) in contact with 

crude oil, and uses CoMo/Al2O3 or NiMo/Al2O3 as metal catalysts (Whitehurst et al. 1998; Shafi &amp;amp; 

Hutchings 2000; Javadli &amp;amp; Klerk 2012).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although HDS is the most widespread physico-chemical method for sulfur removal from crude oil, 

sometimes it is still not enough to reach the increasingly stringent legal limits established. The 

presence of polycyclic aromatic compounds, such as DBT and its derivatives (abundant in heavy 

crude oils), leads to a lower efficiency of sulfur removal. The complex structural characteristics of 

these molecules protects the sulfur atom from the hydrogen attacks, maintaining its structure intact. 



6 
 

Thus, to achieve lower sulfur concentrations, it is necessary to increase the intensity of the physico-

chemical treatment implementing deep HDS.  

Deep HDS is a process that uses higher temperatures and pressures and longer residence times with 

more sophisticated catalysts (Klein 1999), so it has several drawbacks, which are direct 

consequences of the extreme conditions applied towards desulfurization. Deep HDS makes the 

process of removing the organic sulfur highly expensive and substantially increases its carbon 

footprint (Singh et al. 2012). It reduces the quality of the final product, as the higher temperatures and 

pressures used allow the conversion of other chemical components present in the fuel, therefore 

decreasing the octane number (Folsom et al. 1999; Reichmuth et al. 2000; Javadli &amp;amp; Klerk 2012). The 

lifespan of the used catalysts is also shortened by the poisoning effect of the generated H2S (the 

heavier the feedstock, the faster the catalyst deactivates) and the deactivated catalysts constitute a 

hazardous type of waste which poses several disposal problems (Vogelaar 2003; Bhatia &amp;amp; Sharma 

2012). Deep HDS is largely affected by the low-reactivity components in the reaction mixture, such 

as organic hetero-compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Monticello 1996; Folsom et al. 1999; 

Konishi et al. 2000; Egorova 2003).  

Since the production of ultra-low sulfur automotive fuels has gained enormous interest in the scientific 

community worldwide, other desulfurization technologies, much more efficient and less expensive in 

removing HDS recalcitrant organic sulfur compounds, are being used in test scale and commercial 

scale projects. These include oxidative desulfurization (ODS), extractive desulfurization, adsorptive 

desulfurization and biodesulfurization (Babich &amp;amp; Moulijn 2003; Adegunlola et al. 2012; Muzic &amp;amp; Sertic-

Bionda 2013). Among them, ODS combined with extraction (OEDS) or adsorption is considered to be 

one of the most promising processes to remove refractory sulfur compounds from diesel fuel 

(Sampanthar et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2011). However, for heavy oil desulfurization, few of these 

processes are viable and/or as effective as HDS. The approach with the best chance of leading to a 

breakthrough in desulfurization of heavy oil is autoxidation followed by thermal decomposition of the 

oxidized heavy oil. There is also possibility for synergistically employing autoxidation in combination 

with biodesulfurization and hydrodesulfurization (Javadli &amp;amp; Klerk 2012). Therefore, the study for a 

more efficient and profitable way to remove sulfur from crude oils is still mandatory. 

1.5. Biodesulfurization 

Nowadays, biotechnology has replaced several chemical processes, since biocatalysts can function 

at mild conditions and more efficiently. This brings many advantages such as the reduction of energy 

costs, lower emissions and minimal generation of undesirable by-products (Borgne &amp;amp; Quintero 2003; 

Singh et al. 2012).  It is known that oil refining processes are mainly physico-chemical, so 

biotechnological approaches to the problems presented tend to be very well received. Several 

microorganisms and their enzymes have already been studied on both bench and pilot scale for 



7 
 

application on several parts of the refining process, such as biodenitrogenation, biodemetallation, 

biodemulsification and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR), biological control of reservoir souring 

and transformation of heavy crude to light crude and biodesulfurization (Singh et al. 2012).  

Biodesulfurization (BDS) is a biotechnological process corresponding to HDS, since it removes sulfur 

from complex compounds. In the last decade, BDS has drawn wide attention because of its green 

processing of fossil fuels. It takes place at low temperature and pressure, through the use of 

microorganisms capable of metabolizing sulfur compounds, and, in the last 20 years, has been 

extensively studied as an alternative to HDS (Soleimani et al. 2007; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2011). BDS is 

able to remove the most recalcitrant sulfur compounds (for example, DBT), without the use of 

hydrogen and without the formation of H2S. In fact, the removed sulfur is used by the microorganism 

in its own metabolic pathways and it is eventually converted into biomass, turning the process much 

more eco-friendly (Caro et al. 2007; Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008). The maintenance of a desulfurizing 

microorganism is also cheaper than the purchase or development of new chemical catalysts. When 

compared to HDS, this process requires approximately two times less capital and 15% less operating 

costs (Kaufman et al. 1998; Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008).  

There are very few reports on BDS process designs and cost analysis (Gupta et al. 2005). Recently, 

Alves et al. (2015) reported a study where two BDS process designs were analyzed in terms of energy 

consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and costs. This study pointed out for the application 

of the BDS downstream HDS as the best cost-effective conceptual design to apply into an oil refinery. 

Since it is able of desulfurize HDS recalcitrant compounds selectively, BDS integration may lead to 

the accomplishment of the stringent European limit of&amp;lt;10 ppm for S-content on fuels, which otherwise 

may imply the necessity of more severe conditions within HDS units. Deep HDS is a very costly option 

and is not environmentaly friendly because implies higher GHG emissions and substantially increases 

the carbon footprint. 

1.5.1. Dibenzothiophene and biodesulfurization pathways 

The model compound most used in BDS studies is the dibenzothiophene (DBT) (Figure 5). It consists 

of two benzene rings fused to a central thiophene ring which encases the sulfur molecule. DBT is an 

abundant and very recalcitrant thiophene derivative that resists even the action of deep HDS and it is 

easily manipulated, since it is not mutagenic or hazardous to human health, hence its choice for most 

studies (Alves 2007).  

DBT desulfurization can be performed both by anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms. Through the 

anaerobic pathway microorganisms convert DBT into biphenyl with release of H2S as a side-product. 

The anaerobic pathway was firstly described by Kim et al. (1995), who reported a significant 

conversion of model compounds by a concentrated cell suspension of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans 

M6, a sulfate reducing bacterium with high hydrogenase activity. Anaerobic biodesulfurization might

be an alternative to conventional refineries, since there is no production of colored or gum forming 

side products (McFarland 1999). However, growth under anaerobic conditions proceeds slowly, even 

more when organic molecules are involved, and maintaining an anaerobic environment might be 

somewhat difficult in large scale. 

 

 

 

 

 

The aerobic pathway for DBT desulfurization was firstly described by Kodama et al. (1973) and 

became known as the Kodama pathway. This pathway consists in the dihydroxylation of the peripheral 

aromatic ring of the DBT molecule, followed by its cleavage into 3-hydroxy-2-formyl-benzothiophene. 

This compound is water-soluble and maintains the sulfur atom, but has lower carbon content 

compared to DBT. 

About 20 years later the Van Afferden pathway was described. This is a carbon consuming pathway 

present in the bacteria Brevibacterium sp. DO, which can use DBT as a sole carbon and sulfur source. 

During DBT mineralization there is an oxidation into DBT sulfone, then an aromatic dioxygenase 

causes the rupture of the thiophenic ring to form 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2’-sulfinate DBT. Finally, a 

second action of the dioxygenase opens the 2,3-dihyroxybenzene nucleus, resulting in sulfite. This 

compound is then oxidized to sulfate and benzoate, being the latter mineralized into CO2 and H2O 

(Afferden et al. 1993). 

A third aerobic pathway was described by Kilbane (1989) from an isolated Rhodococcus erythropolis 

strain exhibiting a sulfur specific pathway, able to carry out a stepwise selective oxidation of the hetero 

sulfur atom while the carbon skeleton is not metabolized. Rhodococcus erythropolis strain IGTS8 

appeared to be capable of using a wide range of organic sulfur compounds as the sole source of 

sulfur, for example thiophenes, sufides, disulfides, mercaptans, sulfoxides and sulfones (Kayser et al. 

1993). In particular, sulfur is removed from DBT originating the end-product 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-

HBP) (Gallagher et al. 1993). The sulfur specific metabolic pathway for DBT desulfurization involves 

four enzymatic steps and is designated the 4S-pathway (Figure 6).  

Rhodococcus erythropolis strain IGTS8 desulfurizes DBT using three enzymes DszA, DszB and 

DszC, which are located at the plasmid-encoded dsz operon. Denome et al. (1993; 1994) and 

Piddington et al. (1995) provided insight in the sequence of reactions by identifying and cloning the 

responsible genes for desulfurization: dszA, dszB and dszC. Oldfield et al. (1997) succeeded in the 

DBT     4-mDBT   4,6-dmDBT

conclusive elucidation of the 4S-pathway by analyzing its intermediates and products. A mono-

oxygenase (DszC) catalyses the stepwise S-oxidation of DBT, first to dibenzothiophene 5-oxide 

(DBTO) and then to dibenzothiophene 5,5-dioxide (DBTO2). The second mono-oxygenase (DszA) 

catalyses the conversion of DBTO2 to 2-(2’-hydroxyphenyl) benzene sulfinate (HBPS). The last step 

is catalyzed by a sulfinase (DszB) and yields 2-HBP and sulfite as the end-products (Marcelis 2002). 

There is also a fourth enzyme, FMN-reductase (DszD), which regulates the activity of the mono-

oxygenases by adjusting the levels of the reduced flavin (Nomura et al. 2005). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Unlike the Kodama and Van Aferdeen pathways, the 4S-pathway enables the removal of sulfur 

without compromising the carbon skeleton of the molecule. Therefore the calorific power is not 

affected, making it the best pathway for the desulfurization of crude oils. Another advantage of the 

4S-pathway is that it can proceed even when cells are not growing. However, it is necessary to provide 

the essential co-factors to sustain the redox reactions (Martinez et al. 2014).  

In the last decades, several studies have been conducted using bacterial genera capable of using the 

4S-pathway for BDS, which include Arthrobacter, Agrobacterium, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, 

Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Rhodococcus and Gordonia, 



10 
 

being these last two  the most promising (Clark &amp;amp; Kirk 1994; Tanaka et al. 2002; Alves et al. 2008; 

Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2011; Silva 2012; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014). 

1.6. Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B 

The genus Gordonia is very diverse, and was firstly proposed as the genus Gordona by Tsukamura 

(1971), being then renamed as Gordonia by Stackerbrandt et al. (1988). This genus comprises gram 

positive, aerobic, non-sporulating bacteria and is part of the family Gordoniaceae, order 

Actinomycetales, sub-order Corynebacterineae. In fact, Gordonia is closely related to genus as 

Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Rhodococcus, all part of the same sub-order (Goodfellow &amp;amp; Maldonado 

2006). Research about this genus has been increasing since 1998, and 36 different species have 

already been described (NCBI 2015). Some of them, such as G. aichiensis, G. araii, G. bronchialis, 

G. effuse and G. sputi have been isolated from imuno-compromised clinical patients. However they 

are not considered harmful for healthy individuals (Drzyzga 2012). The majority can be found in 

several aquatic and terrestrial habitats, meaning that members of the genus Gordonia are widely 

distributed in the environment as is generally assumed for other mycolic acid-containing 

actinomycetes such as Rhodococcus and Mycobacterium (Drzyzga et al. 2011).  

Many species from the genus Gordonia are attractive for biotechnological uses due to their ability to 

degrade several environmental pollutants as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylpyridines, 

phthalates, xenobiotics or slowly biodegradable natural polymers. They are also attractive due to their 

ability to transform or synthetize organic compounds, such as steroid transformation and carotenoid 

production (Harner et al. 2011; Grace Liu et al. 2011). 

The bacteria G. alkanivorans strain 1B, the microorganism used in the present study, was isolated by 

Alves et al. (2005) from oil contaminated ground samples from Parque das Nações (Lisbon, Portugal). 

It is an aerobic, gram-positive, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and pink/orange-pigmented 

bacterium. Cells were shown to be short branched hyphae, which disintegrated to rods and coccus-

like elements when visualized by phase contrast microscopy. They are non-motile cells generally 

occurring in groups (Alves et al. 2005). 

1.6.1. Desulfurization ability 

The strain 1B was first described as a desulfurizing bacteria in 2005, being able to convert DBT to        

2-HBP at a rate of 2.58 µM.h-1, corresponding to a maximum specific desulfurization rate (q2-HBP) of                      

1.03 ?mol(2-HBP).g-1(Dry Cell Weight or DCW).h-1, using glucose as the single carbon source (Alves 

et al. 2005). Similar results were reported for another strain of the same species, Gordonia 

alkanivorans strain RIPI90A, which obtained a specific desulfurization rate of 1.40 ?mol.g-1(DCW).h-1 

(Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008). 



11 
 

Alves et al. (2007), studying the G. alkanivorans strain 1B desulfurization genes, proved the existence 

of the dsz operon in the genome of this strain. These genes were compared with other sequences of 

relevant desulfurizing microorganisms and showed high similarity with those from R. erythropolis 

IGTS8 (88% for dszA, 88% for dszB and 90% for dszC). The dszAB genes were later cloned and 

expressed in E. coli, which became able of using dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTS) as a sulfur source 

and desulfurize it 4.5 times faster, without the substrate inhibition seen in G.alkanivorans strain 1B 

(Alves et al. 2006).  

1.6.2. Fructophilic behavior and its influence on desulfurization ability 

Usually fructophilic pathways are associated to yeasts, and the only known prokaryotes presenting 

this behavior were lactic-acid bacteria (Leandro et al. 2011; Neveling et al. 2012). However, Alves &amp;amp; 

Paixão (2014b), were able to describe a fructophilic behavior in G. alkanivorans strain 1B. When 

cultivated with fructose as carbon source it was able to achieve an optical density 5-fold higher than 

with glucose after only 5 days, increasing its growth rate from 0.025 h-1 to 0.091 h-1. The greater 

number of functional cells produced in fructose conducted to a more effective BDS process by strain 

1B, as it was attained a q2-HBP about 74% higher than in glucose grown cultures                                        

(2.10 ?mol.g-1(DCW).h-1 in fructose versus 1.20 ?mol.g-1(DCW).h-1 in glucose). Moreover, this 

significant BDS enhancement can be better observed in terms of the overall 2-HBP production rate, 

which increased over 5-fold, from 1.8 µM.h-1 (in glucose) to 9.29 µM.h-1 (in fructose).  

This discovery opened a new line of research, where new alternative carbon sources could be 

harnessed to make the biodesulfurization process industrially viable and profitable. In this ambit, the 

potential of several sustainable fructose-rich materials (agro-industrial materials), such as sugar beet 

molasses, carob pulp, strawberry tree fruit and Jerusalem artichoke tubers, were evaluated as 

alternative carbon sources towards cost-effective DBT desulfurization by strain 1B (Silva 2012; Silva 

et al. 2012; Silva et al. 2015; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014a). All these tested alternative carbon sources 

yielded better desulfurization results when compared with glucose rich carbon sources, however the 

greater results obtained using Jerusalem artichoke (2-HBP production rate = 28.2 µM.h-1 and               

q2-HBP = 5.06 ?mol.g
-1(DCW).h-1) highlighted its potential as the best alternative carbon source towards 

the upscale of BDS by strain 1B (Silva 2012). Therefore, in this work Jerusalem artichoke juice was 

chosen as the preferred cost-effective alternative carbon source to be added towards culture medium 

optimization.  

1.7. Jerusalem artichoke as a sustainable carbon source for BDS 

Heliantus tuberosus (Figure 7) or Jerusalem artichoke (common designation) is a species of 

sunflower originated from eastern North America, from Maine west to Dakota and southwards to 

northern Florida and Texas. It is now widely cultivated worldwide, including countries such as France,

Italy, Portugal, Germany, East European countries, China and also some tropical countries in the 

cooler highlands (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kenya, Zaire and Nigeria) (Lim 2015).  

Although it is a temperate species, the Jerusalem artichoke has good tolerance to frost, draught and 

other adverse conditions, as well as resistance to pests and diseases (Slimestad et al. 2010). It is 

moderately resistant to salinity, being able to grow in salt-affected land with 25 to 50% seawater 

irrigation and at different soil pHs ( Kosaric et al. 1984; Zhao et al. 2008). These properties make it a 

good type of culture for the use in biotechnological processes, since it is not limited by specific growth 

conditions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Jerusalem artichoke tubers are a rich source of inulin (Figure 8), a linear fructan in which a 

variable number of fructose units are linked by ? (2 ?1) bonds. Glucose typically ends the inulin chain 

through a ? (1 ? 2) bond. Inulin is soluble in water and, after hydrolytic breakdown (acidic or 

enzymatic hydrolysis), the reducing sugars fructose and glucose can be easily released (Silva et al. 

2015). The Jerusalem artichoke is an excellent crop for inulin production, and the USA, Russia and 

some European countries use it in several industrial processes (Ziyan &amp;amp; Pekyardimci 2003).

This plant already has many industrial applications. The herbage was found to be a good source of a 

high-quality protein isolate, rich in lysine, which may provide good ruminant feed (Rawate &amp;amp; Hill 1985). 

The tubers are an important fructose source that can be used as sweetener in the food industry (Pilnik 

&amp;amp; Vervelde 1976).  Anaerobic digestion experiments showed that fresh and ensiled above-ground 

parts of the plant could produce up to 680 l of biogas per kg of organic material (Gunnarson et al. 

1985).  

Jerusalem artichoke also has a great deal of unused potential as feedstock for the production of 

bioethanol, using inulin-adapted strains or inulinase-producing strains of yeasts for fermentation. Its 

tubers have been reported to have one of the highest carbohydrate yields of known agricultural crops, 

ranging between 900 and 2400 kg sugars per acre per year, which is equivalent to about                     

1000 – 2400 kg ethanol per acre per year assuming an ethanol yield of 80% of the maximum 

theoretical yield (Margaritis et al. 1981). In fact, Jerusalem artichoke was used as raw material for the 

production of motor fuel alcohol during the Second World War and has been sporadically used for 

this purpose since then (Chekroun et al. 1996). It is also feasible to produce biodiesel from Jerusalem 

artichoke tuber, using the heterotrophic microalga Chlorella protothecoides (Cheng et al. 2009).  

Several Jerusalem artichoke genotypes were found to have promising soil phytoremediation activity 

in removal of heavy metal pollutants like cadmium from contaminated soil (Long et al. 2013). In pot 

experiment studies, Jerusalem artichoke was able to remove heavy metals as Cd, Pd, Ni, Cu and Zn 

from heavy metal-contaminated soils and accumulating them in the plant (Jasiewicz &amp;amp; Antonkiewicz 

2002). Ma et al. (2011) reported that it has been widely cultivated in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong 

and Jiangsu provinces to improve salt-alkaline soils, oil-polluted soils and coal-mining soils. It was 

also reported as antifungal and weed control. The ethyl acetate extracted from the leaves exerted 

antifungal activity, with inhibitory rates of 77.9, 100 and 100% against the plant pathogens Rhizoctonia 

solani, Alternaria solani and Botrytis cinerea, respectively (Liu et al. 2007; Tesio et al. 2011). 

These factors make the Jerusalem artichoke a sustainable carbon source towards bioprocesses (e.g. 

bioethanol production; BDS). Since inulin is rich in fructose, it is an ideal source for the growth of G. 

alkanivorans strain 1B. Silva et al. (2015) described the optimized desulfurization process by strain 

1B using Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) as carbon source. Prior to its utilization, JAJ had to be 

hydrolyzed and its sulfates removed by precipitation with BaCl2. This treatment enabled 

desulfurization of DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B yielding a q2-HBP of 5.06 ?mol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 which 

is 4- to 7-fold higher than those reported in prior BDS studies with other alternative carbon sources  

and very similar to what the author obtained with fructose as pure carbon source (Silva et al. 2012; 

Silva et al. 2015).

1.8. Challenges towards biodesulfurization industrial scale-up 

Since BDS is more efficient and less expensive than HDS in removing sulfur from refractory 

heterocyclic compounds present in crude oil, it could be used in oil refinery as a complement to 

achieve ultra-low sulfur diesel (Alves et al. 2015). BDS can be an alternative/complement to 

desulfurize heavy oils, like shale oils, which have high thiophene concentration. However, to apply 

BDS into an industrial scale it is mandatory to overcome several limitations and problems. 

BDS shows a low conversion rate, which may be caused by feedback inhibition of the enzyme 

activities by the accumulation of the end product of the 4S-pathway (2-HBP), which is extremely toxic 

to most microorganisms (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2011).  The 4S-pathway is also inhibited in the presence of 

other sulfur compounds in the culture medium, and even small concentrations of sulfate or other easy 

access sulfur sources can inhibit BDS (Mohebali &amp;amp; Ball 2008; Silva et al. 2012). To add up, bacteria 

have very low sulfur requirements. In Rhodococcus sp., the cells were found to require 0.1 mM of 

sulfur for normal growth (Reichmuth et al. 2000). Only 1% of bacterial dry weight is sulfur, which 

implies a very low need in relation to this element (Stoner et al. 1990). Therefore, it is important to 

use feedstocks containing low residual concentration or even null content of sulfur (Silva 2012).  

Moreover, there is a limitation associated with the costs of the culture medium. This is a problem 

shared with many other biotechnological processes, representing 30 to 40% of the total value, namely 

the carbon source, which makes the process more expensive (Alves et al. 2015). At present, there is 

no economically suitable method for large-scale preparation of biocatalysts (Tao et al. 2006). Since it 

is necessary to reduce production costs, it is important to search for cheap and widely available raw 

materials. The utilization of alternative carbon sources derived from agro-industrial by-products, 

wastes or plants that can be grown on marginal land may represent a sustainable strategy for 

biotechnological processes (Alves et al. 2008; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014a; Silva et al. 2013; Silva et al. 

2015). Many carbon sources were already tested in the search for a suitable alternative for the 

production of biocatalysts able to perform BDS. The first reported utilization of raw materials as carbon 

sources for this process was by Alves et al. (2008), using recycled paper sludge which is a very 

abundant type of waste resultant of the pulp and paper industry. Recycled paper sludge is very rich 

in cellulose, xylan and lignin which can be hydrolyzed into glucose, xylose and cellobiose, making it 

very interesting as a carbon source. After this work, other alternative carbon sources have been 

tested, with different degrees of success, such as glycerol (Abo-State et al. 2014; Tang &amp;amp; Hong 2014), 

carob pulp liquor (Silva et al. 2012), Jerusalem artichoke juice (Paixão et al. 2013; Silva et al. 2015) 

and sugar beet molasses (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014a).  

Until recently, BDS studies have been focused mainly on model compounds, and this fact also limits 

the ability to demonstrate the commercial potential of this biotechnology (Grossman et al. 2001;  Alves 

2007). Oils are complex substrates, therefore, it is necessary to take into account their associated 



15 
 

problems such as the toxicity of their constituent compounds and the existence of steric hindrance 

associated with the molecular structure of these compounds that might inhibit the activity of microbial 

enzymatic systems (Alves 2007). However, recent studies with petroleum show sulfur removal up to 

90%, using different microorganisms and on different distillates, being achieved an ultra-low sulfur 

diesel with 14 ppm of S-content (sulfur content) (Bhatia &amp;amp; Sharma 2012; Kilbane 2006; Nuhu 2013). 

For the industrial production of the biocatalyst, the use of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor 

(CFSTR), instead of a fed batch system, can bring many advantages (Pacheco 1999). In this system 

cells are always at their maximum growth rate and therefore, all the metabolic pathways are at their 

highest function rate. This system also has the advantage of not accumulating end products which 

can inhibit several pathways, including desulfurization, being an asset for metabolic related 

bioprocesses (Schilling et al. 2002). 

However, the best approach to efficiently perform BDS is still not consensual. Some authors affirm 

that the best approach is to grow the biocatalysts in the same reactor as the BDS is to be performed 

(Schilling et al. 2002). Others state that to efficiently perform BDS it is needed a biphasic system 

where the biocatalyst and the crude oil are only in contact in a thin layer, where BDS occurs. This 

system is proposed by (Yang et al. 2007), and is based in the use of a biphasic continuous stirred 

tank reactor, since the partition of organic and inorganic phases brings many advantages in the down-

stream processing. Another interesting alternative is the immobilization of the biocatalysts, which 

allows an easier recovery and re-use of cells, increased stability to different reaction conditions and 

components and lower biocatalyst contamination of final product (Zhang et al. 2010). 

In overall, there are several problems related to large scale operation, such as the difficulty in the 

control of various parameters that regulate biocatalyst activity and stability, the oil/water volume ratio, 

the logistics of sanitary handling, shipment, storage and use of effective microorganisms within the 

production field or refinery environment (Javadli &amp;amp; Klerk 2012). There are also some problems 

associated with the biphasic system used for BDS. The cells, when mixed with water and oil, produce 

a sort of surfactant, which emulsifies the oil and makes the separation from water and cell recovery 

highly difficult (Alves 2007; Naito et al. 2001).  

When successfully implemented, BDS technology could result in less environmental issues, with a 

CO2 emission reduction of 70 to 80%, smaller residue production and reduced energy consumption, 

which, in turn, is translated in reduced capital (two thirds of HDS) and operational costs             

(Vazquez-Duhalt et al. 2002; Alves et al. 2015). In addition, the BDS process may benefit from the 

simultaneous production of high-added value microbial by-products (such as biosurfactants and 

pigments), which can be further valorized through other industrial processes (De Miguel et al. 2000; 

De Miguel et al. 2001; Veiga-Crespo et al. 2012; Bandyopadhyay &amp;amp; Chowdhury 2014). The final 

product of the 4S-pathway (2-HBP) is a hydrotrope that can act as a surfactant  which could be 



16 
 

recovered from BDS effluents (Mohebali et al. 2007). On the other hand, Alves et al. (2005) described 

Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B as a pink/orange pigmented bacteria. Orange color is normally 

associated with carotenoids as ?-carotene, so this aspect can be exploited taking into account a 

further industrial scale-up of the BDS process using this bacterium (Veiga-Crespo et al. 2012).  

1.9. Scope of the thesis 

Due to the strict European regulations regarding the legal limits on sulfur concentration on fossil fuels 

and their derivatives it is imperative the development of cost-effective technologies to remove sulfur. 

Therefore, the optimization studies of BDS as an eco-friendly technology complementary to HDS 

towards an integrated industrial production of ultra-low sulfur fuels (gasoline/diesel) in a petroleum 

refinery is an important focus of research.   

In this context, the main goal of this study consisted on the component minimization of the culture 

medium for the maximum production of efficient desulfurizing biocatalysts (G. alkanivorans active 

cells) taking into account the lowest operation costs. In fact, the utilization of desulfurizing 

microorganisms that can grow in low nutrient culture media without vitamins and/or other growth 

promoters (e.g. yeast extract, peptone, triptone, etc) is an advantage for BDS upscale since it may 

reduce the biocatalyst production costs significantly. Hence, several objectives were developed: 

? Minimization of the sulfur free mineral (SFM) media, usually used to grow  Gordonia 

alkanivorans strain 1B, in shake-flask  assays; 

? Optimization of SFM medium minimization in chemostat assays;  

? Optimization of biocatalysts production (resting cells of G. alkanivorans strain 1B) in chemostat 

using the minimized medium with the best culture conditions and JAJ as sustainable carbon 

source; 

? Evaluation of the desulfurization ability of a model oil by G. alkanivorans strain 1B grown in the 

chemostat optimized conditions.  

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Chemicals and reagents 

Dibenzothiophene (DBT 99%) was obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium), 2-hydroxybiphenyl 

(2-HBP) was from Sigma (Missouri, USA), dimethylformamide (DMF) was from Riedelde Haën 

(Hannover, Germany), 4-methyl-DBT (96%) was from Aldrich Chem. Co. (Missouri, USA), BaCl2.2H2O 

(&gt;99%) and sodium sulfate anhydrous (&gt;99%) were obtained from Merck (New Jersey, USA). For all 

BDS assays, a stock solution of 150 mM DBT, dissolved in DMF, was prepared. The 5,6-



17 
 

carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) and propidium iodide (PI) were acquired from Invitrogen 

(Massachusetts, USA). All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. 

2.2. Jerusalem artichoke juice 

Jerusalem artichoke tubers were cultivated in a depleted soil in Oleiros, Portugal and processed as 

described in Silva et al. (2015) towards the production of Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ). The JAJ 

was hydrolyzed at pH 2 and 55°C for 48 hours to convert inulin into fructose and glucose and then 

filtered (0.20 µm membranes). For total sulfate precipitation, sterile BaCl2 at 0.5% (w.v
-1) was added 

to the filter sterilized juice adjusted to pH 8.73 (Silva et al. 2015). This JAJ was shaken vigorously, 

incubated at 30°C for 36 hours and finally filtered to remove all BaCl2 (0.45 µm membranes) and again 

filter sterilized (0.20 µm membranes) for storage effects. This JAJ precipitated with BaCl2 for sulfate 

removal (JAJp) was used in minimized medium in shake-flask assays. 

A second process of JAJ preparation was tested, based in inulin precipitation. Untreated juice was 

frozen at -20°C and then defrosted at 4°C, in order to precipitate the inulin. When two phases were 

formed the upper layer was removed. The bottom layer containing pulp and precipitated inulin was 

then hydrolyzed in the same conditions described above to obtain a JAJ with the correspondent 

monosaccharides. In this process, no sulfate precipitation was performed. This JAJ concentrate (JAJc) 

was used in minimized medium in chemostat/bioreactor assay, as an alternative carbon source. 

2.3. Microorganism and culture media 

The microorganism used in this study was the bacterium Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B, isolated in 

our laboratory (Alves et al. 2005). The basal salts medium used for cultivation and maintenance of 

this microorganism was a sulfur-free mineral (SFM) culture medium containing 1.22 g.l-1 NH4Cl,      

2.55 g.l-1 KH2PO4, 2.55 g.l
-1 Na2HPO4.2H2O and 0.17 g.l

-1 MgCl2.6H2O. This medium was 

supplemented with 0.50 ml.l-1 of a sulfur-free trace elements solution (TES) (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014b) 

and its final pH was adjusted to 7.5, before being autoclaved at 121°C, 1 atm for 15 minutes. Pure 

carbon sources such as glucose and fructose were dissolved in Millipore water in 50% (w.v-1) 

concentrated solutions. Pure carbon sources and Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) were filter sterilized 

with a 0.20 µm pore sterile filter before being added to the medium in aseptic conditions, to an initial 

concentration of ?10 g.l-1 total reducing sugars. 

Usually, prior to each assay, a bacterial inoculum was prepared by growing the strain 1B with fructose 

(10 g.l-1) as the single carbon source and 250 µM DBT as single sulfur source. This fermentation was 

performed in a volume of 150 ml, in a 500 ml shake-flask, at 30°C and 150 rotations per minute (rpm) 

in a horizontal incubator (Unitron CH-4103, Infors AG, Bottingen, Switzerland) for 72 hours.

2.4. Culture medium minimization: shake-flask assays 

Culture medium minimization assays consisted in BDS assays in which different formulations of the 

SFM culture medium, above described, were tested with the aim of designing a minimal culture 

medium that did not limit growth or desulfurization by strain 1B. The key culture medium components 

minimized were: nitrogen (NH4Cl), magnesium (MgCl2.6H2O) and TES.  

BDS assays were performed in 500 ml shake-flasks with 150 ml of total volume, by growing a bacterial 

inoculum of 2% (v.v-1), prepared previously as above described, in different formulations from SFM 

medium, varying the nitrogen/magnesium/TES concentrations (ranging from 0% to 75% of the SFM 

original amounts) but maintaining the carbon and sulfur sources concentration (10 g.l-1 total reducing 

sugars; 250 µM of DBT). The details of the tested medium formulations, #1 to #15, are resumed in 

the Table 2, being #1 the original SFM medium (control assay). All BDS assays were carried out in 

triplicates.

2.5. Minimum culture medium: optimization in chemostat  

The continuous culture assays were performed on a bench-top bioreactor BioFlo IIc (1 l vase) with 

390 ml working volume (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, New Jersey, USA). NH4Cl screening 

assays, were performed in a tailor-made bioreactor system coupling a GLS 80? stirred reactor          

(500 ml Duran? GLS80 bottle + screw cap connection system + stirrer shaft from Duran Group GmbH, 

Germany) with 260 ml working volume. The working volume was maintained constant by a surface 

dipped leveling tube linked to a peristaltic pump with adjustable speed while the influx of culture 

medium was kept constant by a second peristaltic pump. In the continuous culture assays, 

independently of the reactor used, the temperature was kept at 30°C, the pH was controlled by the 

addition of 1 M NaOH solution on demand to maintain pH at 7.5, and agitation was kept at 300 rpm. 

The aeration rate was 2 vvm.  

The starting culture medium used for this set of reactor minimization assays was an adaptation of the 

SFM medium (designated as SFMR medium), which was previously optimized in our lab for minimal 

phosphate source. This SFMR medium contained 1.22 g.l
-1 NH4Cl, 0.50 g.l

-1 KH2PO4, 0.50 g.l
-1 

Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0.17 g.l
-1 MgCl2.6H2O and 0.50 ml.l

-1 of TES with a final pH of 7.5 (personal 

communication). Polypropylene glycol was added to the culture medium in all assays in a 

concentration of 0.15 ml.l-1, as a way to control foam formation. The carbon source was added to 

obtain a concentration of 10 g.l-1 total sugars, unless otherwise stated, and 0.03 g.l
-1 Na2SO4 were 

added as a S-source. An inoculum of 10% (v.v-1) was used to start the culture and the continuous 

feed was initiated within a 24 hour time period after inoculation.  

Two types of carbon sources were tested to produce the desulfurizing biocatalysts through continuous 

culture: simple carbon source versus sustainable complex carbon source (JAJ).  In the majority of the 

assays, the used carbon source was a mixture of fructose and glucose (8 g.l-1 fructose + 2 g.l-1 

glucose) to mimic the sugar proportion of JAJ, except for the NH4Cl screening assay where 10 g.l
-1 of 

fructose were used. For the preparation of the mixture of simple sugars, both sugars were diluted in 

Millipore water up to 10% of the total media volume and autoclaved (121°C, 1 atm, 30 min) before 

being added to the final culture medium. JAJ was filter sterilized using a 0.22 µm pore sterile filter and 

mixed with the final medium in a laminar flow chamber. The results obtained in the prior shake-flasks 

minimization assays were used as a basis for the formulations tested in the continuous culture 

optimization assays. The formulations (#1 to #6) tested in the bioreactors are described in Table 3.  

All the steady-state cultures of G. alkanivorans strain 1B were further characterized through 

evaluation of their potential for desulfurization of 250 µM of DBT. Several parameters were monitored 

within the reactor during the steady-state: residual reducing sugars (g.l-1); biomass concentration, 

expressed as dry cell weight (g.l-1); optical density (OD600nm). The metabolic rates (substrate 



20 
 

consumption, carbon recovery and respiratory quotient) were calculated according to Roseiro et al. 

(1999) and Lopes da Silva et al. (2005).

2.5.1. BDS assays using resting cells 

To evaluate the desulfurization ability, cells were collected during each steady-state of the culture 

grown in chemostat to a flask and kept on ice, in order to maintain cell properties. The cell samples 

were then centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge (Sigma model 2-16K, Sartorius AG, Germany), using 

50 ml centrifuge tubes, at 7673 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The resulting pellet was washed with a 

phosphate solution (2.55 g.l-1 KH2PO4 and 2.55 g.l
-1 Na2HPO4.2H2O, pH 7.5) and centrifuged again in 

the same conditions. Finally, the cells were re-suspended in fresh phosphate solution in order to 

achieve a final concentration of about 7 g.l-1 (resting cells suspension).  

BDS assays were performed in 50 ml shake-flasks with 22 ml of total volume and a concentration of 

DBT of 250 µM (30°C, 150 rpm). Sampling was performed every 30 min for 4 hours. Additional 

samples were collected before and after the resting cells desulfurization assays and stored at -20°C, 

for pigment assessment.  

In addition to DBT, a model oil was also tested in desulfurization assays using resting cells from the 

steady-state selected from the optimal continuous culture assays. The model oil consisted of a mixture 

of DBT, 4-methyl-DBT, 4,6-dimethyl-DBT and 4,6-diethyl-DBT diluted in ?-xylene. This model oil was 

added to the resting cells in a 1:5 ratio (organic phase to aqueous phase) to obtain a final

concentration of 500 µM of the different DBT, and incubated in closed 100 ml Duran flasks at 30°C 

and 150 rpm for 24 hours.  All BDS assays were performed in triplicates. 

2.5.2. Pigments extraction 

The biomass samples were centrifuged in a Sigma 2-16K refrigerated centrifuge (7673 x g,                     

20 minutes, 4°C). Each supernatant was discarded and the pellet was uniformly spread in petri dishes 

and then dried at 50°C until ~60% water content was obtained. 25 mg of the dried biomass was 

weighted to 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tubes for extraction, and another 25 mg for dry weight 

assessment.  

Pigments extraction was performed with 1 ml of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) (50°C, 1 hour, 150 rpm) 

in an incubator shaker (Optic ivymen system, Comecta S.A, Spain) and finally the tubes were 

centrifuged at 15000 x g for 5 minutes (Biofuge 15 centrifuge, Heraeus Sepatech, Germany). The 

supernatants, containing the pigments, were transferred to tubes protected from the light and another 

500 µl of DMSO were added to the respective pellets. After being re-suspended, the samples were 

incubated for 30 minutes in the conditions described above, and then centrifuged in the same way. 

This process was repeated until the DMSO was clear.  

The resulting DMSO samples were mixed with acetone, NaCl (20% v.v-1) and ethyl acetate in a ratio 

of 4:1:1:6 respectively and softly inverted and kept at -20°C overnight, so that phase separation would 

occur. The top colored layer was removed and filtered through 0.22 µm syringe filters for the remaining 

analysis. Samples were protected from direct light at all times and stored at -20°C in order to avoid 

pigment degradation prior to analysis.  

2.6. Analytical methods  

2.6.1. Optical density and dry cell weight 

The culture growth was monitored by analysis of the optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific spectrophotometer, model Genesys 20, USA) and dry cell weight (DCW) values. 

DCW was determined by centrifuging the samples 10 minutes at 15000 x g at room temperature in a 

Biofuge 15 (Heraeus Sepatech, Germany) and drying them overnight at 100°C.  

2.6.2. Sulfate analysis 

Sulfate concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Dionex 

chromatograph ICS-1000 (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with an ASRS - Ultra II 

suppressor, an AG14A (4 x 50 mm) pre-column and an IONPAC AS14A (4 x 250 mm) column. Sodium 

carbonate 8 mM was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml.min-1. 



22 
 

Another sulfate assessment technique was used, based in the precipitation with BaCl2. SulfaVer4 

powder pillows (HACH Company, Loveland, Colorado, USA) were used accordingly to the HACH 

DR/2000 spectrophotometer handbook. (HACH Company, Loveland, Colorado, USA). 

2.6.3. Desulfurization assessment 

DBT and its derivatives desulfurization was evaluated by measuring each respective 2-HBP 

production, which is the final product of the DBT desulfurization through the 4S-pathway. The samples 

(0.750 ml) were acidified with 0.025 ml of HCl (4 M) and then a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl 

acetate was performed on a vortex (5 minutes), in order to extract 2-HBP and DBT. After phase 

separation, the organic phase was analyzed by gas-chromatography (GC) (model CP9001, 

Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a flame ionization detector. A 10% CP-5 

CB on 100/120 MESH Chromosorb W-HP column was used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The 

chromatograph oven start temperature was 130°C for 3 minutes and the end temperature 230°C 

maintained for 3 minutes (heating rate of 6°C.min-1). The injector and detector temperatures were set 

for 280 and 290°C, respectively. In all GC measurements (except for model oil) 4-methyl-DBT was 

used as internal standard to minimize variations. 

2.6.4. Sugar measurement 

Glucose and fructose concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography 

(HPLC) instrumentation (LaChrom Merck/Hitachi, Germany) equipped with a differential refractive 

index detector. A Waters SugarPak 1 column (6.5 x 300 mm, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) was 

used operating at 75°C with Ca-EDTA at 50 g.l-1 as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml.min-1. Data 

was analyzed using Chromeleon software ver. 6.40 SP6 build 783 (1994-2003, Dionex). 

2.6.5. Cell health assessment 

Flow cytometric analysis was performed in a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San 

Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm and data was analyzed using FCS 

Express 5 Flow Research Edition software (De Novo Software, 2015). G. alkanivorans cells were 

stained with both 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) (green fluorescence, FL1) and Propidium 

iodide (PI) (red fluorescence, FL3). Stock solutions of 10 mM CFDA in acetone and 1.5 mM PI in 

distilled water were previously prepared and stored at -20°C and 4°C, respectively. Cells were 

centrifuged at 8500 x g for 10 minutes (Biofuge 15, Heraeus Sepatech, Germany), resuspended in 

Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and sonicated for 10 seconds. Concentration of the cell suspension 

was adjusted to approximately 3000 events per second by flow cytometric analysis and the sample 

total volume set to 0.995 ml. The cells were then incubated with 5 µl of CFDA solution for 30 minutes 

at 37°C protected from light. After incubation, cells were washed and re-suspended in Tris-HCl buffer 

and maintained in ice. For the double-staining, cells were adjusted to 1000 events per second and     

1 µl of PI solution was added and the flow cytometric analysis performed immediately. Each sample 



23 
 

was collected in duplicate and readings were performed six times for each duplicate. Instrument 

settings were selected for the forward and side scatter signals in order to discriminate the cells from 

background noise and debris. Samples containing Tris-HCl buffer without cells were analyzed to 

confirm the presence of a constant background noise which was not due to unstained cells. For the 

control assays, healthy (metabolic active) cells were harvested during the exponential phase using 

fructose as the single carbon source (5 g.l-1) and 200 µM of DBT, and after several days of nutrient 

starvation (stressed cells). Dead cells were obtained by incubating healthy cells in ethanol at 70% 

(v.v-1) for 1 min (Silva 2012).  

2.6.6. Real Time-PCR assays: Desulfurization gene expression assessment 

The evaluation of the desulfurization gene expression was performed using the StepOne Plus Real 

Time-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A two-step approach was used: the first step consisted in 

performing RNA extraction and cDNA formation, followed by amplification and quantification. For RNA 

extraction, cells of each steady-state were immediately frozen to inhibit cell modification. These 

samples were then thawed in ice (in order to minimize the temperature shock), normalized to 2 mg of 

cells and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 5 minutes in a Microfuge 18 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter inc., 

CA, USA) to remove the growth media. 250 µl of lysozyme (6 mg.ml-1 in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8) was 

then added and left to incubate for 1 minute at room temperature. After a new centrifugation at         

8000 x g for 2 minutes, the pellet was again suspended in 250 µl of lysozyme and left to incubate at 

37°C for 40 minutes. For the next extraction steps, the RNA extraction kit RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, 

Austin, TX, USA) was used, and the supplied protocol was followed. The amount and purity of 

resulting RNA was accessed using NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific, USA).  

For the production of cDNA from the extracted RNA, the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription 

kit (Applied Biosystems) was used and PCR was performed in a C100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with 

the following conditions: 10 minutes at 25°C; 120 minutes at 37°C; 5 minutes at 85°C; 4°C infinitely. 

The obtained cDNA was then used in the RT-PCR reaction with SYBR-Green PCR master mix 

(Applied Biosystems). SYBR-Green is a DNA binding fluorophore that has high affinity for double 

stranded DNA, enabling the quantification of specific genes. In this case, the primers used are referred 

to the desulfurization genes dszA, dszB, dszC, being the reference gene one copy of 16S DNA 

(whose expression is highly conserved). The gene sequence and melting points are represented in 

Table 4.  

PCR conditions were as follows: 10 minutes at 95°C; 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute 

at 62°C.

2.6.7. Pigments quantification and analysis 

Pigments quantification was performed using HPLC (Agilent 1200 Series system, Agilent 

Technologies, Tokyo) equipped with a ?-Bondapack C18 (250/4.6 mm) column and a detector UV/VIS 

also from Agilent (?=477 nm). The mobile phase was composed by methanol (with 0.2% v.v-1 water) 

and acetonitrile in a 75:25 ratio in a 0.500 ml.min-1 flow during 90 min. Samples were then analyzed 

and compared with standards for astaxanthin (Sigma, 98% purity), canthaxanthin (Roche, 99% purity) 

and lutein (FloraGLO, Kemin, 95% purity) using LC3D ChemStation software (Rev.A.10.02 [1757], 

1990-2003, Agilent Technologies, USA). 

 

3. Results and discussion 

In an industrial bioprocess it is very important to control all the stages in order to maximize productivity 

and minimize the production costs. The reduction of production costs can be achieved through the 

utilization of cheaper carbon sources and by reducing nutrient waste to a minimum (Min et al. 2011; 

Jiang et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2013; Abo-State et al. 2014). This study consisted on the optimization of 

the SFM culture medium for the maximum production of efficient desulfurizing biocatalysts (G. 

alkanivorans strain 1B active cells) taking into account the lowest operation costs towards a future 

BDS process scale-up. In this context, key components of the SFM medium used to grow strain 1B 

(NH4Cl, MgCl2 and TES) were reduced to a minimum while aiming to have no limitation both on the 

consumption of the carbon source and on the biodesulfurization ability.   

3.1. Culture medium minimization in shaken flask assays 

The first series of assays towards the G. alkanivorans strain 1B culture medium minimization were 

carried out in shake-flask. In fact, different formulations of the SFM medium, with different amounts 

of the components: NH4Cl, MgCl2.6H2O and TES (F#1 to F#15), as detailed in Table 2, were tested 

towards the design of the optimal minimum culture medium to produce effective desulfurizing 

biocatalysts. 



25 
 

3.1.1. Nitrogen source (NH4Cl) 

Nitrogen (N) is a major intervenient in cellular growth, representing 14% of the dry cell weight. It is 

found in the composition of amino acids, nucleic acids and enzymes/coenzymes, therefore, it is one 

of the major macronutrients of most culture media (Singh 1971).  

Hence, in the first set of BDS assays in shake-flask, three formulations with different amounts of N-

source (NH4Cl) were tested, namely 75% (F#2), 50% (F#3) and 25% (F#4) of the amount in the 

original medium (1.22 g.l-1 = 100% N), simultaneously with the original medium as a control (F#1 – 

default SFM medium), for comparison. In these screening assays for the N-source minimization (see 

Table 2), the carbon source used was a mixture of fructose and glucose (8 g.l-1 Fru + 2 g.l-1 Glu) and 

the sulfur source was 250 µM DBT. 

Figure 9 (A,B) shows the time course profiles of cellular growth (OD600nm) and sugar consumption for 

the formulations F#1 to F#4, with the different NH4Cl concentrations tested (100% N (original SFM) 

to 25% N).

Figure 9 – Time course profiles for cellular growth (A) and sugar consumption (B) of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in the 
shake-flask cultures with different medium formulations (F#1 to F#4) containing decreasing concentrations of N-source 

(NH4Cl). F#1 corresponds to the control assay with the original SFM medium. All formulations contain 10 g.l-1 total sugars 
as carbon source. Fru: fructose; Glu: glucose.  

Standard deviation (n = 3) is indicated by the error bars. 



26 
 

These results show that the bacterial culture attained an OD600nm of 9.98 with complete consumption 

of the carbon source (Fru+Glu) in the original medium (F#1 – 100% N); an OD600nm of 10.39 with also  

complete consumption of both sugars in F#2 (75% N); an OD600 of 7.87 with complete consumption 

of the fructose but with a remaining of 0.9 g.l-1 of glucose in F#3 (50% N); and an OD600nm of only 4 

with more than half of the total sugars (3.7 g.l-1 Fru and 1.5 g.l-1 Glu) remaining intact in F#4, which 

had the lowest concentration of NH4Cl tested (25% N).  

The data indicates that the amount of the N-source greatly influenced the bacterial behavior. F#4 

(25% N) was clearly insufficient to ensure normal cell growth, resulting in an abrupt stop of the growth 

when all other nutrients were still in excess. Relatively to F#4, F#3 (50% N) permitted a growth 

enhancement, almost doubling the maximum OD600nm attained, but without achieving full consumption 

of sugars. In F#3, fructose was fully consumed but most of the glucose was left untouched. This 

preferential consumption of fructose was expected since the strain 1B is fructophilic (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 

2014b). Only in F#2 (75% N), the strain 1B was presented a growth curve similar to the one obtained 

with 100% N (F#1, original medium), also with a complete consumption of the carbon source 

(Fru+Glu).  

The desulfurization ability of the strain 1B depends mostly on cell physiology, which is influenced by 

the amount of nutrients and carbon in the culture medium. Figure 10 shows the DBT desulfurization 

by strain 1B grown in the formulations F#1 to F#4, with decreasing amounts of N-source (100% – 

25%). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These results point out for the limitation of desulfurization ability of strain 1B by the lack of N-source 

in the culture medium. In F#1, the bacterial culture presented a maximum 2-HBP production of       

227.2 µM and a maximum specific 2-HBP production rate (q2-HBP) of 2.5 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1, being 

capable of achieving total consumption of the 250 µM of DBT by the end of the growth. In F#2, the

Standard deviation (n = 3) is represented as error bars.

q2-HBP obtained was 2.4 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 with a maximum 2-HBP of 167.1 µM and a remaining         

27 µM of DBT. In F#3 and F#4, the q2-HBP obtained was 2.25 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 and                                 

1.41 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1, and the maximum 2-HBP produced was 110.1 µM and 47.8 µM, respectively. 

Relatively to DBT, 69 µM were not consumed in F#3 and 202 µM were not consumed in F#5. The 

desulfurization results for both F#3 and F#4 formulations can be supported by their respective results 

for cellular growth and sugar consumption, showed in Figure 9 (A, B).  

In fact, a NH4Cl concentration ?75% of the original amount (F#2 to F#4) seems to not be sufficient for 

strain 1B to achieve maximum growth with total C-source consumption and fully desulfurization of the 

250 µM DBT provided. The overall growth, sugar consumption profiles and also the q2-HBP were very 

similar for F#1 and F#2, however a maximum 2-HBP production of 167.1 µM was observed in F#2. 

In contrast, in F#1 the maximum 2-HBP production was 227.2 µM (?60 µM higher), despite of the 

consumption of almost all DBT (223 µM) in the F#2. Hence, these results point to the need of using 

a concentration of NH4Cl &gt;75% of the original amount as the minimal N-source towards a minimized 

SFM medium.  

Since nitrogen is a major component of enzymes and functions as a co-factor for innumerous 

essential proteins (Singh 1971; Schimel &amp;amp; Weintraub 2003), it is expected that insufficient amounts 

will lead to deficiencies in cellular processes. This fact can support the sequential decrease in the 

desulfurization rate and, consequently, the maximum 2-HBP production observed in the formulations 

tested, namely from F#1 (100% N) to F#4 (25% N). Only in F#1 (default medium), the N amount was 

sufficient to support the complete cell growth, using the totality of C-source available, and the 

biodesulfurization of all the DBT. In the other formulations (F#2 to F#4), with decreasing NH4Cl 

concentrations, increasing limitations at different levels (e.g. growth rate, sugar consumption, 2-HBP 

production or q2-HBP) were observed.  

Therefore, based on results from Figures 9B and 10, 85% N was extrapolated as an appropriate 

amount to be further tested as minimal N-source within a SFM minimized medium (F#14 and F#15 in 

Table 2).  

3.1.2. Magnesium source (MgCl2.6H2O)  

Magnesium (Mg) is an element essential for cell division and protoplasm formation and is especially 

important for gram-positive bacteria, since it is incorporated in the structure of the peptidoglycan which 

is 90% of the cellular wall (Webb 1939). The SFM medium usually used for the growth of                           

G. alkanivorans strain 1B has 0.17 g.l-1 of MgCl2.6H2O (100% Mg). So, as for the N-source amount 

minimization assays, to select the minimal amount of Mg-source that supports bacterial growth and 

desulfurization ability, several formulations with decreasing concentrations of Mg-source were tested 

(F#5 to F#7, as represented in Table 2), and indicated as percentage of the original amount. The 



28 
 

results obtained were compared with those of 100% Mg (F#1, control assay with default SFM 

medium). 

Figure 11 (A,B) shows the time course profiles of cellular growth (OD600nm) and sugar consumption 

for the medium formulations with the different Mg-source concentrations tested: F#1 (100% Mg) 

(control with original medium), F#5 (75% Mg), F#6 (50% Mg) and F#7 (25% Mg). These results show 

that strain 1B growth and sugar consumption profiles for F#5 and F#6, were very similar to those 

observed for F#1. A total consumption of the 10 g.l-1 total sugars, within 120 h, was observed for these 

three formulations achieving an OD600nm around 10. However, when F#7 was used as culture medium, 

the strain 1B only attained a maximum OD600nm of 8.66 with an overall growth profile slightly below 

the others, despite having a similar growth rate (µMax ?0.06 h
-1 to all). Moreover, strain 1B in F#7 

medium consumed all the C-source (Fru+Glu) with the same sugar consumption profile as the other 

formulations. This fact contrasts with what was observed when N-source was limiting, where 

accumulation of sugars was detected.

Figure 12 presents the desulfurization curves (2-HBP production) by the strain 1B grown in the 

different Mg-source medium formulations. As already described in the N-source minimization assays, 

for control formulation (F#1) a q2-HBP of 2.45 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 and a maximum 2-HBP of 227.2 µM 

were achieved. For the other formulations tested, the respective q2-HBP and maximum 2-HBP obtained 

were: 2.67 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1 and 252.2 µM (F#5), 3.01 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1 and 266.4 µM (F#6), and 

3.37 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1 and 272.1 µM (F#7). In all these formulations, strain 1B was capable of fully 

desulfurize the DBT provided.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These results show an evident enhancement of the maximum specific desulfurization rate (q2-HBP) with 

the decrease of the Mg-source:C-source ratio, from 2.45 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1 (ratio 100% Mg:10 g.l-1 C 

in F#1) to 3.37 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1 (ratio 25% Mg:10 g.l-1 C in F#7). This fact is in agreement with 

results previously reported in studies of DBT desulfurization by strain 1B (Silva 2012; Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 

2014b). These authors reported a q2-HBP of 2.12 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 by strain 1B when SFM medium 

with a ratio 100% Mg:10 g.l-1 Fru was used and a q2-HBP of  6.57 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 by strain 1B when 

SFM medium with a ratio 100% Mg:25 g.l-1 Fru was used. These results also pointed out for the 

stimulatory effect on desulfurization by the decrease of Mg-source:C-source ratio. 

Hence, F#7 (25% Mg) allowed a similar maximum growth rate, despite the lower value for maximum 

OD600nm, and the enhancement of desulfurization. Therefore, it was stipulated as an appropriate 

amount to be further tested as minimal Mg-source within a SFM minimized medium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

3.1.3. Trace Element Solution (TES)  

Trace elements are minerals, such as iron, cobalt and zinc, which are important co-factors in the 

constitution of enzymes (Schade 1949; Waldron &amp;amp; Robinson 2009; Majzlik et al. 2011; Kirsch &amp;amp; 

Eitinger 2014). In fact, 25% – 33% of all proteins require metals in its constitution. These compounds 

are necessary in relatively small amounts, often too small to be correctly measured. Usually, they are

added to the culture media in the form of a solution that includes all the trace elements needed (Alves, 

Matos, et al. 2008).  

For the SFM medium used to grow G. alkanivorans strain 1B, a sulfur-free TES stock solution (Alves 

&amp;amp; Paixão 2014b) is usually added in a concentration of 0.5 ml.l-1. Therefore, as in prior assays 

performed for N and Mg sources minimization, different formulations with decreasing concentrations 

of TES (F#8 to F#13, represented in Table 2) were tested and compared with control (100% TES, 

F#1) in order to evaluate the minimum concentration of the TES needed by the bacterium to grow and 

desulfurize DBT.  

Figure 13 (A,B) presents the cellular growth (OD600nm) and sugar consumption profiles for strain 1B 

grown on the different culture medium formulations containing decreasing concentrations of TES 

(100% to 0%). In Figure 13B, only the sugar consumption profiles for the formulations that 

significantly differ from control (F#1) are represented.

Figure 14 – Desulfurization curves (2-HBP production) by G. alkanivorans strain 1B during its growth in different medium 
formulations (F#1, F#8 to F#13) containing decreasing concentrations of TES. F#1 corresponds to the control assay (SFM 

default medium). All formulations contained ?250 µM DBT as sulfur source.  
Standard deviation (n = 3) is represented as error bars.   

 

These results show that the media formulations F#1 (100% TES), F#8 (75% TES), F#9 (50% TES) 

and F#10 (25% TES) induced a similar behavior on strain 1B and consequently the growth curves 

and the sugar consumption profiles were identical. So, as for the control (F#1) and for F#8 to F#10 

formulations, a maximum OD600nm around 10 was attained with a total sugar consumption (10 g.l
-1) 

within 124 h. This fact indicates that TES ? 25% of the original amount is still in excess. 

So, in order to find the limiting concentration where cellular development would be affected, additional 

formulations with lower TES concentrations, namely 5% (F#11), 2.5% (F#12) and 0% (F#13) were 

also tested. The results obtained showed that in the absence of the TES (F#13) the maximum OD600nm 

achieved by strain 1B was only 3.73 with an accumulation of 6.6 g.l-1 of sugars. In F#12 (2.5% TES), 

the bacterium was able to attain an OD600nm of 7.11 but still accumulated 3.2 g.l
-1 of total sugars. 

However in F#11 (5% TES), a maximum OD600nm of 10.22 with a total sugar consumption was 

achieved, similarly to that observed for medium formulations with ? 25% TES (F#1, F#8 to F#10). 

These results indicate that a TES concentration ? 5% is required for maximum growth of strain 1B 

and full C-source consumption. However, when 5% TES was used the sugar consumption rate was 

somewhat slower than for ? 25% TES, prolonging the fermentation from 90 – 100 h to a total of 118h. 

Figure 14 presents the desulfurization results as the time course profiles of 2-HBP production by 

strain 1B cultivated in the different formulations with decreasing TES concentrations.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These results show a desulfurization enhancement with the decrease of TES concentration to 25% 

in the culture medium. However, for concentrations&amp;lt;25% TES, namely in F#11 (5%), F#12 (2.5%) 

and F#13 (0%), the reduction of trace elements was limiting and the desulfurization stopped within 

about 60 h, attaining lower levels of 2-HBP production. At 0% TES the strain 1B desulfurization was 

probably mediated by trace elements available from water or from contaminants within the other 

nutrients used in the culture medium.

Table 5 summarizes the main metabolic parameters (maximum q2-HBP and maximum 2-HBP 

produced) for the DBT desulfurization by G. alkanivorans strain 1B grown in the formulations with 

decreasing TES concentrations. In agreement with the results presented in Figure 14, the q2-HBP 

values for F#8 (2.80 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1), F#9 (3.19 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1) and F#10                                    

(3.02 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1) were higher than the value of the control (F#1, 2.45 µmol.g-1(DCW).h-1).

Overall, these results seem to indicate that there is some inhibitory effect caused by the TES, since 

a sequential decrease of TES concentration up to 25% (F#10) produces cells with higher 

desulfurization ability than the control. In fact, F#10 with 25% TES induces an enhancement of about 

23% of the specific desulfurization rate in comparison with the control (100% TES). These results are 

also in accordance with what was reported by Alves et al. (2008), which described that some of the 

compounds present in the original TES are somewhat toxic to G. alkanivorans strain 1B. They 

observed that without molybdenum, the strain 1B was able to grow from an OD600nm of 9.25 to 10.25, 

indicating that this component may possess an inhibitory effect. 

Nevertheless, most of the trace elements are essential for strain 1B growth. So the reduction of these 

micronutrients may result in a poor microbial growth and consequently cause the incomplete 

desulfurization of the DBT present in culture medium. This can be due to the malformation of essential 

enzymes, such as DszA, that need the nutrients supplied in the TES to function properly (Ohshiro et 

al. 1999).   

Since 25% TES (F#10) was the lowest concentration tested that permitted maximum cell growth and 

in addition had stimulated desulfurization, this was the chosen amount as the most appropriated to 

be further tested as minimal TES within a SFM minimized medium.  

3.1.4. Minimized medium: commercial versus alternative C-source 

Using the N-source, Mg-source and TES minimal concentrations selected from the prior set of assays, 

namely 85% N, 25% Mg and 25% TES, a SFM minimum (SFMM) medium was designed (F#14, Table 

2) and tested in comparison with the control (F#1 – original SFM medium) to evaluate the overall 

effect of the nutrients reduction. However, since the main goal of this study was to reduce the costs 

associated to DBT desulfurization process by G. alkanivorans strain 1B, i.e. to reduce its culture 

medium costs, the use of a mixture of commercial sugars (Fru+Glu) as C-source is not the cheapest 



33 
 

option. Silva (2012) and Silva et al. (2015), studying alternative carbon sources, highlighted the great 

potential of JAJ as a sustainable alternative carbon source, which enhances the DBT desulfurization 

ability of strain 1B. In this context, another SFMM medium formulation was tested using the JAJ as 

C-source (F#15, Table 2). In addition, the respective control was also prepared for comparison (F#1’- 

original SFM medium with JAJp as C-source, Table 2). Each control assay, using the original SFM 

medium, ran simultaneously with the respective minimized medium (SFMM medium) and served to 

evaluate the overall effect of the collective reduction of several nutrients on metabolic parameters in 

study (cell growth and desulfurization ability).  

Figure 15 (A,B) presents the cellular growth (OD600nm) and sugar consumption profiles for strain 1B 

grown in both SFMM medium (designed F#14 and F#15) and in their respective controls (F#1 and 

F#1’), while Figure 16 presents the biodesulfurization curves obtained with those formulations. In all 

medium formulations were used 10 g.l-1 of total sugars (Fru+Glu or JAJp) as carbon source and          

250 µM DBT as sulfur source.

Comparing the growth profiles (Figure 15A) it can be observed that, despite of the different growth 

rates, strain 1B attained a maximum OD600nm of ?9 in all cultures within 86 h, with the highest OD600nm 

value observed in F#1 (9.55). Higher growth rates can be observed for both media with Fru+Glu as 

C-source (F#1-SFM and F#14-SFMM), however in all formulations the sugar consumption presented 

similar profiles with total consumption within 86 h (Figure 15B).

These results demonstrate that independently of the C-source used, the minimized medium (SFMM 

medium) enhanced the desulfurization by strain 1B when compared to the respective control (SFM 

medium). This is in accordance with the Mg-source and TES preliminary minimization assays results, 

since each minimal amount increased desulfurization. Strain 1B grew normally in the minimized 

medium, and no synergy effects were observed. Comparing the results by C-source (i.e. F#1 vs F#1’; 

F#14 vs F#15), it is possible to observe that for both media (SFM and SFMM) either the growth rates 

(µMax) or the desulfurization (2-HBP production or q2-HBP) were lower when JAJ was used as carbon 

source. This behavior was not expected (Alves &amp;amp; Paixão 2014b; Silva et al. 2015), however the 

decrease in both growth and desulfurization ability, when the JAJp was used as C-source, may be 

justified by the potential toxic effect of the residual barium chloride left in the juice after sulfate 

precipitation procedure. This is in accordance with what was already referred by Silva et al. (2012).  

3.2. Minimum culture medium: optimization in chemostat  

In order to design a future scale-up of the BDS process by G.alkanivorans strain 1B, it is necessary 

to know very well the microbial behavior and physiology in continuous culture. This knowledge allows 

the choice of the best culture conditions towards a cost-effective industrial process with the highest 

production rate of biocatalysts. 

A chemostat is a system into which fresh culture medium (feed) is continuously added, while spent 

culture media, containing leftover nutrients, metabolic end products and microorganisms, is 

continuously removed (effluent) at the same rate to keep the microbial culture volume constant. One 

of the most important features of chemostats is that microorganisms (bacteria) can be grown in a 

physiological steady-state under constant and optimal conditions. In steady-state, the growth occurs 

at a constant specific growth rate and all the culture parameters remain constant (culture volume, 

temperature, pH, cell density, aeration, agitation, nutrients, products, etc). The microbial specific 

growth rate can be optimal if the best dilution rate and culture conditions are established (Roseiro et 

al. 1996; Roseiro et al. 1999; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2013). 

In this context, based on the minimal amounts of N, Mg and TES tested in the SFMM medium for the 

shake-flask assays, respectively 85% N, 25% Mg and 25% TES, the next step was to apply this 

combined reduction in the SFMR medium and optimize the culture conditions towards the maximum 

production of efficient desulfurizing biocatalysts, i.e. resting cells of strain 1B. Resting cells differ from 

growing cells because there are no changes in cell metabolism and no cell multiplication, since no 

nutrients and carbon source are provided. This procedure allows the testing of the desulfurization 

ability with a constant cell concentration.

3.2.1. Optimization of the N-source minimization in a low-cost chemostat 

The first set of assays in chemostat were carried out towards the minimization of the N-source (NH4Cl) 

in the SFMR medium, since the minimal amount of 85% N used in SFMM medium for shake-flask was 

selected based only in an extrapolation from the sugar and desulfurization results. For these assays, 

a tailor-made bioreactor system coupling a GLS 80? stirred reactor with 260 ml of working volume 

was developed. Figure 17 shows the setup of this low-cost chemostat during an assay of continuous 

culture with strain 1B for N-source minimization. In this system, the most expensive parts are the pH 

controller, the pH electrode (250 mm), the peristaltic pumps and the GLS 80? stirred reactor. The 

other components can be easily found in a laboratory.

Therefore, different medium formulations with decreasing concentrations of N-source, F#1 (100%), 

F#2 (75%), F#3 (50%) and F#4 (25%) (see Table 3), were tested in order to evaluate the minimum 

concentration of NH4Cl needed by the bacterium to grow and further desulfurize. In these continuous 

cultures, the only C-source used was 10 g.l-1 fructose, since it allows the use of higher dilution rates 

(0.07– 0.08 h-1) and consequently decreases the time necessary to enter steady-state. Table 7 

presents the metabolic characteristics for each bacterial culture steady-state (SS) obtained for the 

formulations F#1 to F#4, designated as SS#1, SS#2, SS#3 and SS#4, respectively. All conditions 

were maintained constant; therefore the culture behavior translates the physiological response of the 

microbial cells to the influence of the N-source amount in the culture medium.

in SFMR medium formulations with decreasing N-source concentrations.

qFru – specific rate of fructose consumption;

CR – carbon recovery (percentage of supplied carbon that is used in the cells constitution);

Yx/s – cell yield (cell mass produced per mole of substrate consumed). 

 
These results show that steady-state chemostat cultures of strain 1B (SS#1 to SS#4 cultures) were 

obtained at a dilution rate comprised in the range of 0.07 – 0.08 h-1. Comparing the steady-state 

continuous cultures, it can be observed that the marked decrease in the metabolic parameters overall, 

associated to cell growth (OD600nm, biomass, biomass production rate and fructose consumption rate) 

may be linked with the reduction of the N-source amount, from 100% N to 25% N. The restriction of 

bacterial growth by the N-source limitation is consistent with the accumulation of C-source that is 

observed for the formulations with ?75% N, as 8.15 g.l-1 fructose were accumulated by the SS#4

culture (25% N). Moreover, the highest values for CR, CCE and Yx/s that were obtained by the SS#4 

culture also highlight that strain 1B directed all the fructose consumed (?2 g.l-1) to biomass production 

in response to the nitrogen limitation. 

For the production of cost-efficient biocatalysts (resting cells of strain 1B) it is necessary that all C-

source and S-source are consumed, since the accumulation of C-source implies the accumulation of 

S-source in culture and this effect inhibits the desulfurization ability of the resting cells (personal 

communication). In this context, despite the slight differences observed in the metabolic responses of 

SS#1 (100% N) and SS#2 (75% N) cultures, only the SS#1 culture had effective cells capable of 

desulfurizing the DBT or fossil fuels, with fully consumed carbon and sulfur sources. Therefore &gt;75% 

N is required for the culture to grow and fully consume the C-source as well as produce the maximum 

effective biocatalysts yield. These results are in agreement with those previously obtained in the N-

source minimization shake-flask set of assays (see Figures 9 and 10), which have also pointed out 

for 75% &amp;lt;N-source amount ? 100% as the optimal amount. 

Additionally, flow cytometry was also used to evaluate the influence of N-source amount reduction on 

the physiological state of the strain 1B cells in each steady-state culture (F#1 to F#4). For flow 

cytometry analysis, cells were stained with PI and CFDA in order to access membrane integrity and 

metabolic activity. Figure 18 presents the dispersion graphics obtained for each steady-state culture 

analyzed, showing the populations of cells with different physiological states: healthy, stressed 

(compromised membrane), inactive and dead cells.

and 100%. UpL, UpR, LwL, and LwR are the quadrants designation (see figure 10).  
Standard deviation (n = 12) is indicated by the error bars. 

 

Additionally, Figure 19 shows the bacterial cells viability in each steady-state culture, quantified as 

percentages of healthy, stressed, inactive and dead cells. These results show the physiological 

response of strain 1B to the N-source amount reduction in culture medium, demonstrating that the 

lack of N induced the decrease of healthy cells and consequently the increase of stressed, inactive 

and/or dead cells. In SS#4 culture (25% N) it can be observed the highest percentage of inactive 

(7.6%) and dead cells (2.7%), as well as a high value of stressed cells (14.7%). In SS#3 culture (50% 

N), the lack of N-source is translated mainly by a great increase of stressed cells, from 7.5% (SS#1 – 

100% N) to 21.8%, and consequently the decrease of healthy cells, from 82.5% (SS#1) to 71%. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Moreover, these results also indicate that SS#1 and SS#2 cultures (100% N and 75% N) have a 

comparable percentage of healthy cells, 82.5% and 88.2%, respectively. The slight difference 

observed can be associated to the fact that the SS#1 culture consumed the C-source available in the 

medium causing the beginning of a starvation period, in contrast with what happened in SS#2 culture, 

which accumulated C-source and S-source and therefore the C-source was not limiting.  However, 

SS#2 culture, despite presenting the highest percentage of viable cells (94%, healthy + stressed 

cells), was not able of further DBT desulfurization due to the S-source accumulation in the culture 

medium, as already referred.  

Since the optimal N-source amount for G. alkanivorans strain 1B to grow and fully consume the C-

source would be above 75% and lower than 100%, an interpolation concerning this amount was 

carried out based on a polynomial regression fit to BPR = f(N-source amount), where BPR is the 

biomass production rate, a parameter indicator of the bacterial growth (Figure 20).

Based on this model, the minimal N-source amount stipulated to apply in further minimum culture 

medium optimization assays in chemostat was 90%, since the BPR estimated is similar to that of 

100% (0.34 g.l-1.h-1 for 90% N and 0.35 g.l-1.h-1 for 100% N). 

3.2.2. Minimized medium: commercial versus alternative C-source 

Based on the minimal amounts stipulated for N-source (90%), Mg-source (25%) and TES (25%) from 

the prior set of assays (shake-flask and low-cost chemostat), two more continuous cultures (SS#5 

and SS#6), were carried out towards the development of the optimal minimized medium for                 

bioreactor (SFMMR – SFMR minimum). This process aimed to achieve the maximum yield of effective 

biocatalysts (strain 1B resting cells). 

As already referred, in chemostat, the microbial specific growth rate can be optimal if the dilution rate 

and culture conditions are well defined. Therefore, for faster growth and maximum biomass yield, the 

highest dilution rate possible should be used. However, if a dilution rate is too high there will be 

accumulation of the culture medium components, leading to nutrient surplus and, in the limit, to cell 

washout.  

The dilution rates for the two SFMMR medium continuous cultures (using different C-sources, Fru+Glu 

versus JAJc (SS#5 vs SS#6, Table 3)) were chosen based in the average growth rates obtained in 

the correspondent SFMM medium for shake-flask assays (F#14: µ = 0.07 and F#15: µ = 0.05).This 

choice was based on the fact that the µmax (0.08 h
-1 and 0.06 h-1, Table 6) could be too high causing 

nutrient accumulation, namely sulfate. Sulfate accumulation will further inhibit the desulfurization 

ability of the produced biocatalysts, hindering their potential application for BDS processes.  

Additionally, due to the possibility of JAJp causing further inhibition of BDS probably due to the residual 

BaCl2 present in the juice, as referred for F#1’ and F#15 batch cultures (shake-flask assays), a 



41 
 

different JAJ was used as C-source: JAJc (see section 2.2 for details). This JAJc has a higher ratio of 

carbon/sulfate (300 g.l-1 total sugars/ 600 mg.l-1 sulfate), enabling the use of the juice without BaCl2 

precipitation. Since its dilution to 10 g.l-1 total sugars in the culture medium also account for the optimal 

sulfate amount without requiring additional S-source (see F#6, Table 3). 

The metabolic characteristics for both bacterial culture steady-states, in the minimized medium 

(SFMMR medium, see F#5 and F#6 in Table 3), using Fru+Glu (SS#5) versus JAJc (SS#6) are 

registered in Table 8. Operational conditions were maintained constant; therefore the culture behavior 

translates the physiological response of the microbial cells to the influence of the C-source in the 

minimized culture medium (SFMMR medium), with 90% N, 25% Mg and 25% TES.  

Comparing the two steady-state cultures, SS#5 versus SS#6, it can be observed that SS#5 culture 

presented a higher biomass production (3.97 g.l-1) than SS#6 (3.10 g.l-1), which is consistent with the 

overall metabolic parameters associated to growth (OD600nm, biomass, biomass production rate, 

sugars consumption rates, qFru, qGlu). Moreover, the biomass production rate of SS#5 was 1.7-fold 

higher than the one obtained with SS#6, which could be explained by the higher dilution rate used 

(0.065 h-1 versus 0.047 h-1). The results obtained for CR, CCE and Yx/s are very similar for both SS 

cultures, demonstrating an overall similar behavior of the cells grown in the minimized medium, 

despite the different C-source. In addition, the SFMMR medium also permitted the total consumption 

of the available sugars in both SS cultures, avoiding any nutrient accumulation which may be a BDS 

inhibitor.

Further desulfurization results obtained with resting cells from SS#5 (q2-HBP = 2.90 µmol.g

and SS#6 (q2-HBP = 12.23 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1) showed a 4-fold higher desulfurization ability from the 

biocatalysts produced in the SFMMR medium using the alternative C-source (JAJc). 

Additionally to the metabolic study, flow cytometry analysis (Figure 21) was also performed to 

evaluate the physiological state of the cells from each SS culture (SS#5 and SS#6). Flow cytometry 

results show a percentage of viable cells &gt;93% for both cultures (SS#5: ?95% = 62% healthy + 33% 

stressed; SS#6: ?93% = 73% healthy + 20% stressed) and consequently&amp;lt;7% of inactive and dead 

cells (SS#5: 3.6% inactive + 1.1% dead; SS#6: 3.7% inactive + 2.8% dead), demonstrating the overall 

good physiological state of each culture.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore, the overall metabolic and physiological results pointed out for SS#6 culture resting cells 

as the optimized cost-effective biocatalysts for BDS processes with G. alkanivorans strain 1B. In fact, 

these efficient biocatalysts are capable of enhanced DBT desulfurization

was 2.4-fold higher than that obtained by Silva (2012) using strain 1B growing cells and JAJp as

3.3. Evaluation of the expression of the dsz operon by Real Time-PCR 

In complement to the BDS assays using resting cells of SS#5 and SS#6 cultures, the evaluation of 

the desulfurization gene expression (regulated by dsz operon) in both chemostat cultures was 

performed through a Real Time-PCR system (RT-PCR). A two-step RT-PCR approach was 

performed as described in section 2.6.6. For each SS culture, the RNA was first extracted from cells

Fru+Glu) versus cells of SS#6 culture (SFMMR medium, JAJc) showed that the overall gene 

expression for the three dsz genes was higher for SS#6 culture cells, despite of the different levels of 

expression by each gene: dszC expression was 22% lower for SS#5 cells (Ratio SS#5/SS#6 = 0.78), 

dszA was 83% lower for SS#5 cells (Ratio SS#5/SS#6  = 0.17) and dszB was 99% lower for SS#5 

cells (ratio SS#5/SS#6 = 0.01). These results are in accordance with the higher desulfurization 

achieved by SS#6 biocatalysts (q2-HBP = 12.23 µmol.g-
1 (DCW).h-1). 

3.4. Desulfurization of a model oil 

In order to scale-up the BDS process with resting cells of G. alkanivorans strain 1B into a petroleum 

refinery it is necessary to first evaluate their potential to desulfurize crude oils, which are complex 

mixtures rich in thiophenic compounds that are recalcitrant to HDS. Crude oil BDS has several 

associated problems that must be taken into account, such as phase separation between the water 

and organic phase; toxicity of the organic solvent or inhibition of desulfurization due to the presence 

of multiple substrates. 

Crude oil was simulated through the design of a model oil, consisting on a mixture of DBT 

(dibenzothiophene) and several DBT derivatives dissolved in o-xylene, and posteriorly prepared and 

tested in a BDS assay using resting cells of SS#6 culture in a biphasic system (organic phase: model 

oil + aqueous phase: resting cells re-suspended in a phosphate solution). 

Figure 22 shows the gas chromatography (GC) profiles for the model oil desulfurization by strain 1B 

SS#6 resting cells. This figure shows that all DBT derivatives in the mixture were reduced to the 

respective product: 2-HBP for DBT, 4-methyl-2-HBP for 4-methyl-DBT, 4,6-dimethyl-2-HBP for 4,6-

dimethyl-DBT and 4,6-diethyl-2-HBP for 4,6-diethyl-DBT. 

Therefore, a complete desulfurization of the model oil by strain 1B was observed within 72 hours. The 

ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B to desulfurize a model oil, with DBT, 4-methyl-DBT and 4,6-

dimethyl-DBT, was already described by Alves et al. (2008). Based on each q2-HBP value obtained 

during the mixture desulfurization, these researchers also demonstrated that strain 1B has a selective 

preference for: DBT &amp;lt;4-methyl-DBT &amp;lt;4,6-dimethyl-DBT.  

These results show the potential of strain 1B to desulfurize complex mixtures of DBT derivatives. 

Nevertheless, much improvement must be still carried out towards its possible industrial scale-up, as 

a complement to HDS into a crude oil refinery.

3.5. Pigments analysis of pre and post-desulfurizing resting cells 

One of the strategies used to make industrial bioprocesses economically viable is to take advantage 

of high added value products resulting from the biomass (Makkar &amp;amp; Cameotra 1999; FitzPatrick et al. 

2010; Veiga-Crespo et al. 2012). One example of such products are carotenoids, pigments that are 

produced by many microorganisms and have a high market value.  

To evaluate if secondary metabolites, such as pigments, 

produced by G. alkanivorans strain 1B could be affected by 

the desulfurization process, pigments extraction of samples 

from pre- and post-desulfurization assays (Pre BDS, Post 

BDS) using both SS#5 and SS#6 resting cells were 

performed. Figure 23 (A-D) shows a picture of the dried 

biomass of each sample extracted for pigments 

quantification. All biomass samples presented an orange 

color, however, there is a visible difference between the color 

of SS#6 resting cells biomass before (Figure 23C) and after 

desulfurization (Figure 23D), presenting the latter a more 

intense orange. 

Figure 24 presents the results of the pigments analysis by HPLC of the four extracts obtained. The 

analysis of the chromatograms revealed the presence of several carotenoid related peaks, of which 

only lutein, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin were identifiable, representing less than 50% of the total.

Figure 24 – Analysis of the main carotenoids produced by pre- and post-desulfurization strain 1B cells from SS#5 and 
SS#6 resting cells (RC). SS#5-preBDS and SS#5-postBDS are resting cells produced in the chemostat with SFMMR + 

(Fru+Glu) medium; SS#6-preBDS and SS#6-postBDS are resting cells produced in the chemostat with SFMMR + (JAJc) 
medium. PreBDS –pre-desulfurization (fresh RC); PostBDS – post-desulfurization (exhausted RC). 

 

Overall, the SS#5-preBDS cells (Figure 23A), from SFMMR+ (Fru+Glu) medium, were able to produce 

116 µg.g-1(DCW) of lutein and 18 µg.g-1(DCW) of astaxanthin. No canthaxanthin was observed. For 

SS#5-postBDS cells (Figure 23B), it was observed an increased production of lutein and astaxanthin, 

189 µg.g-1(DCW) and 49 µg.g-1(DCW), respectively. In this case, canthaxanthin was also produced, 

attaining 27 µg.g-1(DCW). Relatively to the cells grown in SFMMR + JAJc medium, for SS#6-preBDS 

cells it was observed a production of 100 µg.g-1(DCW) of lutein, 13 µg.g-1(DCW) of astaxanthin and    

8 µg.g-1(DCW) of canthaxanthin. Again, an increase of the overall pigments production was observed 

for the SS#6-postBDS cells, attaining 184 µg.g-1(DCW) of lutein, 114 µg.g-1(DCW) of astaxanthin and 

36 µg.g-1(DCW) of canthaxanthin. From these results, it can be stated that the exhausted resting cells 

(SS#5-postBDS; SS#6-postBDS) produced higher amounts of all identified carotenoids (lutein, 

astaxanthin and canthaxanthin) than fresh resting cells (SS#5-preBDS; SS#6-postBDS). Lutein was 

the most abundant carotenoid, both for pre- and post-desulfurization resting cells from SS#5 and 

SS#6 cultures. Astaxanthin and canthaxanthin are pigments with orange and red color, respectively. 

The presence and increase of these pigments justify the difference in color observed in the petri 

dishes (Figure 23).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These results also show a different profile on carotenoids production for resting cells originated in a 

minimized medium with Fru+Glu (SS#5) versus JAJc (SS#6), as C-source. SS#5-postBDS attained a 

total pigments production of about 265 µg.g-1(DCW) in comparison to the 334 µg.g-1(DCW) for       

SS#6-postBDS cells. The total carotenoids produced by G. alkanivorans strain 1B cells was higher 

than those obtained by G. jacobaea (CECT 5282), 227?µg.gDCW-1, a genetically modified Gordonia 

strain used for pigment production (De Miguel et al. 2000; De Miguel et al. 2001; Veiga-Crespo et al. 

2005; Veiga-Crespo et al. 2012). This brings good prospectives to the optimization of pigments 

production towards their utilization in the agro-alimentary industry. 



46 
 

Since DBT desulfurization enhanced the overall pigments production in the resting cells used as 

biocatalysts, the further exploitation of these high added value products from the exhausted microbial 

biomass can be coupled to BDS process as a decisive factor to bring economical balance to its 

possible scale-up (Paixão et al. 2016). 

4. Conclusion 

The shake-flask minimization assays allowed the design of a minimized culture medium (SFMM 

medium) containing 75-100% of N-source, 25% of Mg-source and 25% of TES (% of the original 

amounts used in the default SFM medium). Using 85% N, the SFMM medium was tested with two   

C-sources (Fru+Glu) versus JAJp and the results obtained demonstrate that independently of the       

C-source used, the SFMM medium enhances the desulfurization by strain 1B in comparison with the 

respective control (SFM medium).  

Based on these minimal amounts established for SFMM medium, the next step was to apply this 

combined reduction in the SFMR medium and optimize the culture conditions in chemostat assays, 

where bacteria can be grown in a physiological steady-state under constant and optimal conditions. 

In this context, after a first screening on the minimal amount for N-source using a low-cost bioreactor, 

the established SFMMR medium (90% N, 25% Mg and 25% TES) was tested in two more continuous 

cultures (SS#5 and SS#6) for the development of the optimal minimized medium for reactor taking 

into account the maximum yield of effective biocatalysts (G. alkanivorans strain 1B resting cells). The 

results highlighted the SFMMR medium with JAJc as C-source as the optimal minimized medium in 

which cost-effective biocatalysts can be produced (SS#6 resting cells), attaining a desulfurization     

(q2-HBP) of 12.2 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1, about 4-fold higher than the one observed with the biocatalysts 

from the SFMMR medium with Fru+Glu as C-source (q2-HBP = 2.9 µmol.g
-1(DCW).h-1 for SS#5 resting 

cells). RT-PCR results confirmed the higher expression of the overall desulfurization genes (dszA, 

dszB, dszC genes) in the SS#6 resting cells. 

Moreover, a BDS assay for a model oil (500 µM, DBT + 4-methyl-DBT + 4,6-dimethyl-DBT, and 4,6-

diethyl-DBT), using SS#6 resting cells culture in a biphasic system, was performed showing the ability 

of complete desulfurization within 72 h by these biocatalysts. Additionally, it was also demonstrated 

that the exhausted biocatalysts were able to produce high amounts of carotenoids (334 ?g.g-1(DCW)). 

The further exploitation of these high added value products from the exhausted microbial biomass 

can also be coupled to the BDS process as a decisive factor to bring economical balance to its 

industrial scale-up in addition to the low-cost culture medium (SFMMR medium) developed for the 

effective biocatalysts production in bioreactor. This reflects great perspectives for the future of BDS 

as an integrated part of the petroleum treatment industry.

5. Future Works 

As a future work, it is important to further test the influence of magnesium in desulfurization by strain 

1B. It is also important to test desulfurizing cells with crude oil or diesel/gasoline, in order to better 

understand how G. alkanivorans strain 1B cells react in “real” fossil fuels. Finally, more tests must be 

conducted to optimize conditions to maximize both desulfurization and pigment production during 

desulfurization.
