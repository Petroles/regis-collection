A bstract

A b s t r a c t

A microscopic drying model for capillary porous medium is presented in this thesis. This 
microscopic model is based on a network approach for porous medium and is used to study the 
drying behavior inside the porous medium at the pore level during the drying process. The driving 
force for liquid transfer is the capillary force and the mass transfer in gaseous phase is the vapor 
difiiision. The Kelvin effect is considered in this model, i.e., the gas-liquid interface is treated as a 
meniscus. The gravity force is neglected because the size o f the pores and throats in network are 
large enough (&gt; 20 jim). Drying process is simulated using this model on various 100x20 square 
networks which contain 2000 pores and 4000 throats. The liquid used is alcohol. The drying 
process is assumed to be isothermal.

The phase distribution effect, the Kelvin effect and the influence o f the velocity of the 
external flow upon the drying process are investigated. Three distinct regions are observed in all 
of the simulation results, i.e., dry region, unsaturated region and saturated region. The 
evaporating front region (unsaturated region) is relatively stable, although it is far from a flat 
surface. Many temporary liquid clusters appear in the unsaturated region and the cluster number 
increases with the distance o f the evaporating front from the interface.

It is found that the phase distribution (moisture heterogeneities) has a great influence on 
the drying rate through the formation of funicular drying zones, specially at the beginning of the 
drying process. This influence decreases with the receding o f the evaporating front from the 
interface. The drying process becomes vapor difiiision dominated after the interface is totally 
dried and the influence o f phase distribution heterogeneities decrease. The evaporation- 
condensation mechanism is observed in the simulation, which confirmed the existence of such 
process in the drying o f capillary porous medium.



A b stra ct Hi

Concerning to the microscopic model, it is found that Kelvin effect makes a very small 
difference in terms of the difltusion driving force caused by the curvature. The Kelvin effect, 
however, is very important from the pomt of view of the evaporation-condensation mechanism. 
The appearance of condensing clusters changes the drying path due to the liquid removing 
process, altering the phase distribution during the drying process. This influence is affected by the 
network formation.

The incoming velocity of the external flow over the interface o f the porous medium has 
influence on the local mass fluxes as would be expected. But it is significant only while the 
interface is totally or partially wetted. This influence decreases with the receding evaporating 
fi-ont. Concerning the stability o f the evaporating fi-ont, it seems that this is only important at the 
beginning o f the drying period.

R e s u m o

Um modelo de secagem microscópico para o meio poroso capilar é apresentado nesta 
tese. Este modelo microscópico é baseado em uma abordagem de rede para o meio poroso e é 
usado para estudar o comportamento da secagem no interior do meio poroso durante o processo 
de secagem em escala dos poros. A força motora para o transporte do líquido é a força capilar e a 
transferência de massa na fase gasosa é a difusão de vapor. O efeito Kelvin é considerado neste 
modelo, ou seja, a interface gás-líquido é tratada como um menisco. A força gravitacional é 
ignorada pois os tamanhos dos poros e gargantas da rede são relativamente grandes (&gt; 20 [xm). O 
processo de secagem é simulado usando este modelo em várias redes quadradas 100x20, 
contendo 2000 poros e 4000 gargantas. O líquido é álcool e o processo de secagem é assumido 
isotérmico.

O efeito de distribuição da fase líquida, o efeito Kelvin e a influência da velocidade do 
escoamento externo sobre o processo de secagem são investigados. Três regiões distintas são 
observadas em todas as snnulações, isto é, região seca, região não saturada e região saturada. A 
frente de evaporação (região não saturada) é relativamente estável, mesmo que a superfície seja 
hregular. Muitas ilhas isoladas temporárias surgem na região não saturada e o número dessas ilhas 
aumenta com a distância da frente de evaporação da interface.

Constatou-se que a distribuição da fase líquida (heterogeneidade da umidade) tem uma 
grande influência sobre a taxa de secagem através da formação das zonas secas funiculares, 
especiahnente no início do processo de secagem. Esta influência dimmui com o recuo da frente de 
evaporação da interface. O processo de secagem toma-se dominado pela difusão de vapor após a 
secagem total da interface e a influência de heterogeneidade da umidade diminui. O mecanismo 
evaporação-condensação é observado na simulação, influenciando o processo de secagem através 
da mudança do caminho da secagem.



Resumo

No que diz respeito ao modelo microscópico, o efeito Kelvin tem pouca influência com 
relação à força motora de difiisão, causada pela curvatura. Entretanto, esse é muito importante do 
ponto de vista do mecanismo evaporação-condensação. O surgimento de ilhas isoladas em 
processo de condensação muda o caminho da secagem devido ao processo de retirada do líquido, 
alterando a distribuição da fase líquida durante o processo de secagem. Essa influência é afetada 
pela distribuição de poros da rede.

A vazão do escoamento externo tem uma influência na taxa de evaporação local, como 
era de se esperar. Entretanto, isso é importante apenas enquanto a interface está total ou 
parcialmente molhada. Esta influência diminui com o recuo da frente de evaporação no interior do 
meio poroso. A estabilidade da frente de evaporação parece ser importante somente no início da 
secagem.

1.1 B a c k g r o u n d

Many processes involve heat and mass transfer between a fluid and a porous medium. The 
convective drying of porous materials and the thermal insulation o f buildings are two examples. 
Especially, drying is an essential operation unit in the industrial production and one of the most 
energy-intensive processes in industry. There is hardly a product in the processing industries that 
does not have to be dried one or more times during the course of its production. Sometimes, the 
drying operation cost can affect the economics of all process. To improve process performance 
and energy utilization, new drying technologies have been studied and applied, such as fluidized 
and spouting bed drying, freeze drying, spray drying and dielectrically-assisted convective drying, 
with emphasis on increasing the heat and mass transfer area and the transfer coefBcient at the 
interface between external flow and porous material. Although these drying technologies have 
been used in industry production, the drying model for prediction of the processes are generally 
empirical or semi-empirical. From the theoretical point of view, even the simplest situation, such 
as the convective drying of a bed of glass beads at room temperature is still a challenging problem 
for the modelers. One of the reasons which precludes the existence o f a general model for the 
prediction of drying of porous material is the great variety of the materials encountered in practice 
and the geometric complexity of their structures. Porous media include a lot o f materials which 
are encountered literally everywhere in everyday Ufe. A material or a structure must pass at least 
one of the following two tests in order to qualify as a porous medium (Dullien, 1979).

(1) It must contain spaces, so-called pores or voids, free of solids, imbedded in the solid or 
semisolid matrix. The pores usually contain some fluid, such as air, water, oil, etc., or a mixture of 
different fluids.

(2) It must be permeable to a variety of fluids, i.e., fluids should be able to penetrate 
through one face of a septum made of the material and emerge on the other side.

Fig. 1-1 Moisture movement at various stages in the 
drying of a porous material (from Bories, 1991)

When a sample of wet porous material dries under constant external conditions, that is, 
temperature, humidity and air-velocity held constant during the drying process, four phases of 
moisture movement within the material may be distinguished (Fig. 1-1). In the first phase, the 
sample is saturated with the liquid, the moisture flows as liquid towards the interface under a 
hydraulic gradient due to the difference of capillary force. There is no vapor or air inside the 
porous medium, or it can be neglected. In the second phase, a part of the sample has been dried, 
the moisture has withdraw from the waist of the pores, and moisture can migrate either by 
creeping along the capillary walls or by successive evaporation and condensation between liquid 
bridges (Fig. 1-2). The evaporation-condensation mechanism through liquid bridges works as 
following.

Fig. 1-2 A liquid bridge at a narrow throat

Initially, the menisci curvature at the two sides of the liquid bridge are equal due to the 
thermodynamic equilibrium condition (indicated by solid line). The vapor flows in the direction



C hapter I G eneral Introduction

indicated by the arrow due to the gradient of partial pressure caused by the difference of menisci 
curvatures and the temperature. Vapor condenses at the surface of meniscus A, resulting in a 
decreasing of the meniscus curvature (plotted by dashed line) and the unequilibrium of capillary 
force between two sides. The meniscus B (soUd line) has a higher curvature than meniscus A. This 
curvature difference of menisci at the two end sides of the liquid bridge resuhs in a pressure 
difference inside the liquid phase, i.e., a gradient of hydraulic pressure from A to B is established. 
As a consequence, liquid flows from high to low pressure and a new equilibrium tends to establish 
at the two end sides of the liquid bridge (dashed line). If the vapor pressure at the side B is lower 
than that of side A, the liquid at meniscus B will evaporate causing an increasing in curvature. 
Vapor will condense on side A and evaporate on side B, and liquid is transported through the 
bridge. The liquid bridge can last if the condensation rate at one side is equal to the evaporation 
rate at the other side. Of course, the liquid bridge could have two evaporating or condensing 
menisci at its both sides depending on the moisture content adjacent to the menisci. If the two 
menisci are evaporating, the liquid bridge will become smaller and smaller until it disappears. On 
the other hand, if the two menisci are condensing, the liquid bridge will become bigger and bigger 
until its menisci reach the throat edges.

On a latter drying stage, the liquid bridges evaporate entirely leaving only adsorbed 
moisture behind. During this last phase, moisture moves by unhindered diffusion. The final stage 
o f the porous medium is one of desorption-adsorption during which any moisture evaporated is 
condensed and the body is in hygrothermal equilibrium with its environment.

The internal moisture flow may be affected by several factors depending on the structure 
of the solid matrix, the type o f moisture bonding, the moisture content, temperature and pressure 
in the capillaries, etc. The main mechanisms which cause internal moisture flow are:

(1) Capillary forces
(2) DifRision due to concentration difference
(3) Phase change (evaporation - condensation mechanisms taking place in the pores)
(4) Surface diffusion of moisture on adsorbed liquid layer at the capillary surface
(5) Difference in total pressure
(6) Gravity
(7) Thermo-diffiision

Several of these mechanisms dominate at a given time during drying, and their importance 
are not the same for different porous materials. It depends on many factors such as material 
composition, period of drying, pore size etc. No matter which mechanism controls the drying



C h apter I G eneral Introduction

behavior, the drying rate curve is almost common to all materials (Fig. 1-3). A general drying 
process wUl now be described (Peishi and David, 1989, Bories, 1991)

If the initial moisture content o f the porous medium is high enough, almost all material 
surface is covered by a liquid fihn and the internal moisture transfer is mainly attributable to 
capillary flow o f free liquid. The drying rate is then generally controlled by the convective heat 
and mass transfer coefficient of the external flow. If the external conditions are constant, the 
drying rate is constant in this period. It is also known that if all the heat needed for evaporating 
the liquid is supplied by the ak, the temperature of the material surface will take on a value very 
close to the ambient wet-bulb temperature (Prata and Sparrow, 1985a, 1985b and 1988)

Fig. 1-3 Variation of drying rate with time

As drying proceeds, the liquid supplied to the surface by capillary forces becomes 
insufficient to replace the liquid being evaporated. When the moisture content reaches a certain 
critical value, discontinuous wet patches will occur at the material surface. Thus, the mass transfer 
coefficient decreases with the surface free liquid content and the first falling rate period starts. In 
the first falling rate period, a new energy balance will be reached at the surface, accompanied by a 
slowly rising o f the surface temperature. Free liquid still exists at the surface, the 'dry' patches still 
contain bound liquid, and the vapor pressure at the surface is determined by the Clausius- 
Clapeyron equation.

When the surface moisture content reaches its maximum sorptive value, no free liquid 
exists at the surface. The surface temperature will rise rapidly, signaling the start of the second 
f a l l i n g  rate period, and evaporation takes place only inside the material.



Chapter 1 G eneral Introduction

The main difficulty in modeling the drying behavior lies in the prediction of the falling rate 
period which is, in fact, the essential period of drying. Such a prediction requires a rigorous and 
detailed physical and mathematical description of internal mechanisms and boundary conditions.

1 .2  L it e r a t u r e  R e v ie w

The description of heat and mass transfer is usually based on the transport equations 
resulting from the differential balance laws. To predict the mass and heat flux from a given 
material requires detailed information on the surrounding velocity and temperature fields. For a 
continuous medium, this information is extracted from the solution of the associated microscopic 
equations subject to pertinent boundary conditions.

For porous media, these local or microscopic equations are generally still valid within the 
pores. However, the geometric complexity of the pores medium precludes a general solution of 
the detailed velocity and temperature fields.

To overcome these difficulties, the continuum approaches are generally used to obtain 
'macroscopic' equations, valid at a Representative Elementary Volume (R.E.V.). In these models, 
the porous medium is treated as a fictitious continuum medium and the variables o f interest 
(moisture contents, temperature, etc.) are not representative at the pore scale but at the scale of 
small volumes containing a sufficient number of pores (R.E.V.) (Bachmat and Bear, 1986). The 
majority of these models are based on the work of Philip and de Vries (1957), Luikov (1966) and 
Whitaker (1977). The fundamental hypotheses for all macroscopic models are the continuum 
approach involving generalized Darcy's and Fick's laws and the relative permeability concept. The 
macroscopic equations for heat and mass transfer in porous medium have the following form 
(Bories, 1991);

^  = V (D Vw + DTVT)-V ( ^ K V y )  (1-1)
d i Ps

( p c ) ' 5  = V((X,- + j:p.D „)V T +lp.D „V w ) (1-2)
oi

in which w and T denote the local moisture content and temperature in the porous medium, 
respectively. All coefficients of equations (1-1) and (1-2) are dependent variables of moisture 
content and temperature and must be specifically determined for each porous medium. For more 
details, one can refer to Crausse (1983) or Crausse.et al. (1981).



C hapter I General Introduction

As have been pointed out by Masmoudi et al. (1991), these equations have not yet been 
derived from the microscopic equations by means o f a rational approach such as, for instance, the 
volume averaging method (Whitaker, 1977) in a completely satisfactory way. Doubt remains with 
regard to the validity of these equations from a theoretical point of view. It has been shown that 
one cannot expect to describe certain two-phase flow processes in porous media according to a 
continuum approach because of the occurrence o f large-scale heterogeneities in the fluid 
distribution within the porous medium. These heterogeneities are associated with the action of the 
capillary forces in a system containing a sufficient distribution of pore size. In some cases, 
moisture content heterogeneities could also be associated with macroscopic heterogeneities of the 
structure (Maneval and Whitaker, 1988).

Some macroscopic equations are derived from microscopic equations through volume 
averaging techniques (Slattery, 1970, Gray, 1983, Whitaker, 1986a,b, Moyne et al., 1988, Bear 
and Bensabat, 1989 and Moyne et al., 1990). These equations are assumed to be valid, on the 
R.E.V., of average volumes of microscopic quantities. The main advantage of this kind of 
approach is to provide a clear physical significance o f the macroscopic coefficients, relating 
energy and moisture fluxes and temperatures and moisture content gradients.

Bories (1991) reviewed some theoretical, numerical and experimental studies published 
during the last decade on simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the drying of capillary- 
porous bodies and concluded that despite the limitations of the theory and the underlying 
assumptions, the macroscopic model is a good tool to describe and to analyze the drying of 
capillary-porous bodies. However, many doubts still remain regarding the macroscopic models. 
For example:

• What are the transport properties of the material in question?
• What are the appropriate values of the convective heat and mass transfer coefficients 

to be used at the interface between the porous medium and the external flow?
• What is the minimum size of the averaging volume or Representative Elementary 

Volume for the material and transport phenomena in question?
• How the liquid is distributed inside the porous medium during the drying process?
• To what extent is the heterogeneity o f liquid phase distribution?
• To what extent is the influence o f the heterogeneity of liquid phase distribution upon 

the drying process?
• What is the importance of Kelvin effect on the drying process?

In a number of studies (Whitaker and Chow, 1983, Plumb et al., 1985), it has been found 
that the heat and mass transfer coefficients at the interface must be allowed to vary during the



Chapter 1 G en eral Introduction

drying process in order to obtain satisfactory agreement between experimental and numerical 
results. The heterogeneities of moisture content at the interface has a great influence upon heat 
and mass transfer coefficient. Traditional one-dimensional simulation is not suitable to describe 
this phenomenon. Two-dimensional or three-dimensional simulation is needed to improve the 
accuracy of the numerical results.

In the falling rate period, the fi’action of wet area decrease with decreasing interface 
moisture content. However, the continuum approach model can not answer how the fraction of 
the wet area varies with the interface moisture content and where is the wet and dry patches at 
interface.

Furthermore, most of the macroscopic models have a common resolution o f drying, i.e., 
interface is the first part to be dried, then the dried region proceeds inside the porous medium. In 
other words, there is always a positive moisture gradient fi’om the bottom of sample to the 
interface; the moisture at the bottom is always higher than that at the interface. This is probably 
true for some o f the porous media, but not for all.

Lee et ai. (1992) reported some surprising phenomena in the drying of 65 [im and 120^m 
glass beads. They observed that in all cases these beads had the lowest saturation at the bottom 
and very close to the investigated drying surface. In this case sufficient suction potential is 
developed to lift the entire water colunm in the packed bed towards the drying surface, resulting 
in two drying fironts; one at the top of the bed and one at the bottom. This observation is contrary 
to any of the model predictions that are available in literature. One can note fi’om Lee et al. results 
that the moisture gradient can be negative at some place and positive at other place fi-om bottom 
to surface.

Lee et al. also measured the pressure at the bottom of the sample for the 65|im beads. It 
was found that the pressure dropped very quickly to 0.305 cm (vacuum) of water as the bed 
began to dry but after a short period rose to atmospheric. This implies that air broke through fi’om 
the surface of the bed even at high liquid saturation.

It is also well-known that strong heterogeneities in the fluid phase distribution may occur 
during drying process (trapped clusters of fluid) (Lenormand et al., 1988). However, in its 
standard form, the model of Philip and de Vires carmot account for the occurrence of such 
heterogeneities, which is not surprise because of the fundamental hypotheses of such kind of 
model -— continuum approach. One cannot expect to describe the heterogeneous phenomena by 
using a continuum concept.



Chapter 1 G eneral Introduction

To answer some of the questions posed previously, percolation theory seems to be a good 
alternative. Percolation theory, developed over the last decades, is ideally suited as a conceptual 
framework for interpreting the morphology and transport properties of disordered composite 
materials. In several papers (Larson, 1977, Pathak, 1980 and Larson et al., 1981), it is shown that 
percolation ideas provide the basis of an unified theory of the properties o f porous media and 
fluids therein.

Many transport process may be successfully idealized as transport of an abstract 'fluid' 
through an abstract 'medium'. Difiiision of a solute through a solvent is an example of such a 
process. If, as in this example, the 'fluid' (solute) is imagined to 'flow' randomly, the process is 
termed a difiiision process. If, on the other hand, the 'fluid' flow paths are determined by the 
'medium', but the 'medium' itself is in some sense random, the process is called a percolation 
process. This classification, and the introduction of percolation theory, are due to Broadbent and 
Hammersley (1957).

In percolation theory, the porous medium is really treated as a 'porous material', i.e., parts 
of solid and parts of pores are identified. It is almost impossible to describe the geometry of 
porous media exactly because of their complexity and to overcome this difficulty, many simple 
geometric descriptions of porous media through percolation theory have been employed in 
previous studies. The most used method is the network model. In this model, the pores can be 
represented by spheres (for 3-D representation) or cylinders (for 2-D representation) and 
coimected by throats. The liquid and vapor can migrate firom one pore to others through the 
throats. This approach will be discussed in more details in Chapter 2.

Network models of pore structure were first pioneered by Fatt (1956). More recently, 
pore-level physics have been combined with percolation theory concepts to predict the 
macroscopic transport and capillary equilibrium properties o f porous medium, such as capillary 
pressure curves and relative permeability curves. One of the early attempts in this direction was 
the work of Chatzis and Dullien (1977), who applied bond percolation to regular two-dimensional 
and three-dimensional lattices in order to simulate the mercury intrusion porosimetry curves of 
sandstones. Bond-correlated site percolation in random networks was latter introduced by Chatzis 
(1980) as a more realistic model for the simulation o f immiscible displacement in sandstones. 
Other contributions applying percolation theory concepts to capillary displacement in two- and 
three- dimensional networks include the works o f Mohanty et al. (1980), Larson et al. (1981), 
Mohanty and Salter (1982), Chander et al. (1983), Wilkison and Barsony (1984), Guyon et al. 
(1984) and Yanuka et al. (1989). Network models consisting o f unit cells o f the constricted-tube 
type, have been developed by Payatakes et al. (1973,1980). Models o f this type were used to 
study single-phase flow (Constantinides and Payatakes, 1989) and two phase immiscible



C hapter 1 G eneral Introduction

displacement (Dias and Payatakes, 1986) in porous media. Network models of spheres-and- 
capillaries have been used by Lapidus et al. (1985), Conner et al. (1983), Conner and Lane (1984) 
and Tsakiroglou and Payatakes (1990) in simulations of mercury porosimetry. Most of the above 
cited studies are parametric investigations o f the effect o f model parameters on model predictions. 
The network models can be used to predict the structure and transport properties of porous media 
which are used in the macroscopic model for drying of porous media (loarmidis and Chatzis, 
1993). However, few works have been done to predict the drying process of capillary porous 
media directly by using the network model.

Masmoudi et al. (1991) used the invasion percolation theory to predict the drying of 
capillary porous media. In their model, drying is considered as an immiscible displacement process 
at low capillary number where air and water are displacing and displaced fluid, respectively. In 
absence o f gravity, immiscible displacement can be characterized by two dimensionless numbers, 
the viscosity ratio M and the capillary number Ca which are defined as following,

^ t-t(displacmg fluid) ^ tn(di,pi^

M'CdispIaced fluid) C7

where V and a  denote the displaced fluid average velocity and the interfacial tension, respectively. 
Ca represents the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces. Depending on the values of Ca and 
M, three main flow pattern have been identified (Lenormand et al., 1988)

• viscous fingering
• capillary fingering
• stable displacement

In the case o f drying, for air as the displacing fluid and water as the displaced one, 
M = 1.8 X 10-?  and typical value of capillary number are smaller than 10 '". At very low capillary 
number, such displacement can be associated with invasion percolation as statistical model 
(Lenormand et al., 1988, Wilkison, 1984). The invasion process is entirely controlled by the 
capillary mechanisms that take place at the microscopic scale, and the randomness due to the 
different size o f pores. During the invasion process, the non-wetting fluid can only enter the throat 
associated with the largest radius of curvature (which corresponds the smallest capillary pressure). 
Invasion percolation is thus a local model. At each step, the displacing fluid invades one pore 
according to the size of the throats along the boundary between the two fluids within the material. 
In the work of Masmoudi et al. (1991), the main efforts were devoted to characterizing the 
trapped fluid clusters. The experimental results were obtained using a two-dimensional 
transparent etched network which containmg about 10,000 ducts with seven classes o f width



C hapter 1 G en eral Introduction 10

(from 0.1-0 6 mm) distributed at random. It was found that liquid clusters of various size 
appeared during the drying process. The number and size of the clusters depend on the relative 
importance o f capillary and gravity. The occurrence of clusters affects the interfacial transfer 
coefficient. The width of the trapped cluster region tends to increase with the average distance 
fi'om the interface.

Plumb and Prat (1992) developed two microscopic models for describing transport 
phenomena in capillary porous media. The first consists of a two dimensional array of square 
particles having a log-normal size distribution. The randomly sized particles are placed on a 
Cartesian grid with centers distributed uniformly resulting in a network of non-uniformly sized 
pores. In the second model, the porous medium is represented using two sets of elements: pores 
and throats, located respectively at the sites and bonds o f a two-dimensional Cartesian lattice. All 
sites and pores have the same size, however, the width of the throats is selected randomly 
according to a log-normal distribution. The prediction of liquid transport due to capillary action 
and difiiision in the vapor phase were made using both models. It was found that the prediction of 
capillary pressure and vapor phase difiusivity agree with resuhs available in the literature 
qualitatively and that the Representative Elementary Volume for such properties is larger than 
that traditionally accepted for other properties such as porosity and dry diffiisivity. The maximum 
array or network size used in their study was 40x40. The studies o f Plumb and Prat are 
introductory and deals only with transport phenomena inside the porous matrix. External flow 
was not considered in their model.

In the more recent work o f Prat (1993), an isothermal drying model of capillary porous 
media was presented based on a modified form of invasion percolation theory. The porous 
medium is conceptualized as a network of pores connected by narrow throats. In addition to 
capillary and gravity effects, evaporation at the microscopic gas-liquid interface and vapor 
difiiision in the gases phase were taken into account. This leads to a modification of the invasion 
rules associated with invasion percolation. In this model, the trappmg cluster phenomenon was 
considered. Contrary to the standard invasion percolation, permanent trapping cluster does not 
occur because of the evaporation at the border of each cluster during the drying process. Some 
drying simulations on a two-dimensional network containing 5000 ducts were carried out using 
this drying model. The phase distribution inside the network was presented and compared 
favorably with experimental resuhs obtained using a two-dimensional micromodel (Masmoudi and 
Prat, 1991). The Kelvin effect was not taken into account in this model, i.e., the gas-liquid 
interface was treated as plane.

The purpose of this work is to develop a microscopic model for capillary porous media by 
using the network approach to simulate the drying process, and to study the influence of the 
heterogeneity of the porous media from a microscopic point of view, such as liquid distribution 
heterogeneity and the trapped cluster phenomenon. The final goal of this work is to describe the 
heterogeneities of moisture at the surface and inside o f porous media, to obtain the liquid 
distribution at each step of the drying process, and to study the influence of dry patches 
phenomenon on the mass transfer at the interface between a fluid and a capillary porous medium.

2.1 P r o b l e m  Co n f ig u r a t io n

The problem studied here focus on the convective drying of capillary porous media (Fig. 
2-1). It consists of two parts; external flow (dry air flow) and internal flow (porous media). The 
external flow could be considered here as a steady laminar flow with zero incidence at the 
surface. The vapor mass fraction and velocity of the external flow are denoted by o  and U, 
respectively. The porous medium is assumed to be saturated initially and can be represented by a 
network model. The liquid in porous medium can only evaporate from the top open edge. Other 
three edges are impermeable.

For simplicity, only the isothermal drying of non-hygroscopic capillary porous medium is 
considered. The terminology "capillary porous medium" implies that capillary effects are the main 
mechanism of internal moisture transfer in the liquid phase (Prat, 1993). In these materials, 
contrary to the hygroscopic materials, the liquid moves through the pores and not the solid phase, 
i.e., the liquid sorption phenomena may be neglected. The mechanism for vapor transfer inside the 
porous medium is the vapor difiiision through the empty pores. There can be an adsorbed liquid 
film on the solid surface (Rogers and Kaviany, 1992) which is due to the van der Waals' 
dispersive forces, and is significant when the pores are very small (smaller than 1 (am). The 
surface adsorption/desorption will not be addressed here since only pores larger than 1 nm will be 
considered.

The traditional approach to attack such a problem can be summarized by the following
steps;

(i) the external flow is determined by assuming a no-slip condition at the porous surface.



Chapter 2 Problem  Formulation 13

(ii) heat and mass transfer is obtained by coupling the equations describing transports in 
both media by expressing continuity of temperature, mass fraction, and heat and mass normal flux 
densities at interface.

Fig. 2-1 Configuration of the problem

Considering that a microscopic model will be used here to describe the drying of the 
porous medium, one could understand that the traditional approach for this configuration is no 
longer suitable. The difficulties appear both inside the porous medium, and at the interface 
between the external flow and the porous medium. The question is how to deal with the phase 
change inside the porous medium. In the present model, the liquid is evaporated at the air-liquid 
interface and then transported to the top open edge by vapor difiiision. There is an evaporating 
front inside the porous medium and its form change continually during the drying process. It is 
difficult to simulate the real transient process of drying because of this evaporating front inside 
the porous medium. This will be discussed in more details in the section o f boundary conditions 
for the porous medium.

For the convective drying of the porous medium, it was first assumed that both external 
flow and the flow inside the porous medium are in an equilibrium at each time interval of drying 
process, i.e., the evaporating rate at the interface is constant for each time interval. The no-slip 
boundary condition is employed at the interface between the external flow and porous medium. 
Thus the external flow problem is analogous to a boundary layer problem over a flat plate. For 
each time interval, the species concentration problem is solved independent of the mass transfer in 
the porous medium. The mass transfer in the porous medium (diffiision fluxes in empty throats 
and the evaporating rate at the evaporating front) were determined with the obtained moisture 
content profile at the interface. The evaporating fi"ont inside the porous medium keeps the same



C h a p te r !  Problem  Formulation 14

form during this time interval. In this way, the mass transfer of the external flow and porous 
medium is solved separately in a segregate manner. To update the moisture content field of the 
external flow at each time interval, the information of the mass transfer of porous medium is 
passed to the external flow. The coupling between the mass transfer of porous medium to the 
external flow will be discussed in more details in chapter 3.

2 .2  P r o b l e m  F o r m u l a t io n

2.2.1 External Flow Problem

As have been discussed before, use will be made of the continuum approach to the 
external flow, with the no-slip condition at the interface. For a detailed discussion of the validity 
of a no-slip condition at the porous surface, one can refer to the work o f Masmoudi and Prat 
(1991). In this respect the external flow is similar to the boundary layer problem over a flat plate. 
This is a well studied problem, and the governing equations are given by

V -U  = 0 (2-1)

U-VU = - - ^  + u ^ ^  (2-2)
p 5x dy

-  5^0
U - V ( D = J ^ —  (2-3)

where u  = u j + u j  is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, u  is the kinematic viscosity, p is 

density, is the binary difiiision coefiicient and to is the mass fi'action o f the vapor of the 
evaporating liquid.

There is no time derivative in equations (2-2) and (2-3) because it is assumed that the 
external flow reaches a steady state at each time interval of drying process. The time evolution for 
the external flow can thus be viewed as a succession of steady states.



C hapter 2 Problem  Formulation 15

2.2.2 Boundary Conditions for the External Flow

The boundary conditions at the interface depend upon what kind of model is used for the 
porous medium. For the case of a macroscopic model, the boundary conditions are somewhat 
simple. However, for the case of a microscopic model, different boundary conditions at the 
interface will be required for the solid, foil throats and empty throats.

The boundary conditions for equation (2-2) are given as following,

U; = 0 at the solid surface (2-4)

^  (2-5)
PAi ^

dy
Uyi = --Sab at empty throats (2-6)

where the subscript a ,  b  and i denotes the vapor, air and interface respectively. Equation (2-5) 
represents the vertical velocity of vapor at the interface (Prata and Sparrow, 1988). In accordance 
with the impermeability condition, the naturally occurring diffosive flow o f air to the interface 
must be balanced by a convective flow of air away firom the interface, this is taken care of by the 
ratio p/p^i in equation (2-5), as will be discussed later in section (2.2.3.3). Equation (2-6) is Fick's 
law and gives the vertical velocity of the vapor at the interface between the porous media and the 
external flow.

For equation (2-3), the boundary conditions are,

• = 0 at solid surface (2-7)d(ÙM
d y

©Ai = o* for full throats (2-8)

= -p-? AB — — for empty throats (2-9)
d y

where the ca* is the vapor mass fraction at the system temperature for corresponding throat radius 
and the J is the vapor difiiision flux density within the empty throats. With given boundary 
conditions, one can solve the governing equation numerically by using the control volume method 
(Patankar, 1980), for instance.

2.2.3 Microscopic Model for Porous Medium

2.2.3.1 Network M odel fo r  Porous Medium

The structure of most real porous media is too complex for an exact mathematical 
description. For this reason, simplified geometrical models of the porous media are usually 
employed. Based o f such simplified models, transport process in porous media can be predicted. 
One can refer to Dullien and Batra (1970), van Brakel (1975), and Payatakes and Dias (1984) for 
reviews o f different models based on pore network used for various classes of porous media.

Fig. 2-2 Some example o f lattices and pore network

Different network models (square, hexagonal, triangular, Kagomw, cubic, and node of a 
pore network, for example, Burganos and Sotirchos, 1987, Fig. 2-2) should be used to describe 
the structure of different porous media. The geometrical structure of a packed bed o f sand, for 
instance, is different fi'om that of a piece of wood. Therefore, a very important step is to select an 
appropriate network model for a given porous medium. To some extent, the choice of the 
network is a factor that can determine the success of a microscopic model. Generally, the image 
analysis technique should be used to study the structure of porous media. The distribution of 
pores can be obtained and the appropriate network can be selected by using this technique.

For simplicity, we could consider the porous media as a network consisting of pores and 
throats. Thus, the porous media will be treated here as a cubic (for three-dimensional) or square 
(for two-dimensional) network of spherical (or cylindrical) pores interconnected by cylindrical (or



C h a p te r !  Problem  Formulation 17

rectangular) throats. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores will be held fixed. 
The diameters o f pores and throats could be chosen randomly fi-om preselected distribution 
(Gaussian or log-normal, for instance). This makes the network model adopted here different 
firom that o f Plumb and Prat, 1992. In their model, only the throat diameter a log-normal 
distribution but the diameter of pores was kept the same. Where two adjacent pores are found to 
intersect during the network construction, one of them is randomly interchanged with another 
pore of the network. A similar interchange is made if a throat is found to be larger than one of the 
two pore at its ends. One can refer to Constantinides and Payatakes (1989) for more details on 
the computer-aided construction of the network.

2.2.3.2 Liquid Transport in Porous Medium

In the present model, the driving force for liquid transport is the difference o f the capillary 
pressure. For the convective drying problem treated here, the inmiiscible displacement concept is 
not appropriate to describe the drying process because all the liquid which were taken fi-om the 
porous media is in vapor state. In other words, the liquid have to become vapor before it is 
transported to the external flow. For the immiscible displacement process (Kaviany, 1991), there 
is no mass exchange through the air-liquid interface, and the liquid is displaced simply by the air,
i.e., the liquid is taken fi-om the porous media in liquid state. That is the case in the work of 
Masmoudi et al. (1991) and Plumb and Prat (1992), where the drying is treated as an immiscible 
displacement process. The present author is in doubt about this approach.

The description of the liquid transport adopted here will now be presented. At the 
beginning of drying, all of the pores and throats are filled with liquid, and only the throats 
adjacent to the surface are in contact with the external dry air flow. The evaporation o f liquid 
takes place at the throats which have an air-liquid interface. As drymg proceeds, the curvature of 
menisci of the throats adjacent to the interface decrease. When the curvature of the menisci reach 
a critical value, i.e., the meniscus of the biggest throat is approximately hemispherical, its 
curvature stops changing. As a result of evaporation, the meniscus o f the biggest throat adjacent 
to the surface recedes inwards the porous matrix, and all others menisci remain at the same 
position because their suction potential are higher than that of the biggest throat. The liquid which 
evaporated fi-om the smaller throats are replaced by liquid fi'om bigger throats which have an air- 
liquid interface. In other words, bigger throats lose their liquid in two ways, by evaporation and 
by liquid flow caused by difference of capillary pressure. Smaller throats virtually do not lose 
liquid because they can get liquid fi'om bigger throats to replace their evaporated liquid There is a 
balance between the rate of evaporation and liquid flux caused by difference of capillary pressure. 
The menisci of smaller throats do not recede as long as this balance holds. For a discussion o f the



C hapter 2 Problem Formulation 18

influence of gravity and viscosity in this balance, the reader is referred to Prata and Prat, 1995. At 
the later period of drying, the difference of capillary pressure become smaller, and liquid 
evaporated fi’om small throats can not be replaced by liquid transported by difference of capillary 
pressure, and the menisci of the small throats begin receding. At this moment, all o f the menisci 
recede either because o f evaporation or liquid flow.

Fig. 2-3 gives a simple example o f the liquid transport in the porous medium. The menisci 
A and E are plate at the initial. Liquid evaporate fi'om both menisci A and B and their curvature 
decrease. When their curvature reach the critical value o f meniscus A, their curvature stop 
changing. The meniscus A recedes to the position B. The meniscus E remains at the interface 
because it can take the liquid fi’om larger throat to replace the evaporated liquid. After throat 1 is 
empty, the meniscus recede to the position C and throat 3 still has condition to take liquid fi-om 
throat 2 to replace its evaporated liquid. Meniscus E begin to recede inside the porous medium 
only after the meniscus from throat 2 reaches the position D because there is no more larger fiill 
throat from which throat 3 can take liquid. As a result o f evaporation, the menisci E and D 
change their position in the same time until throat 3 is empty.

As mentioned before, the trapped liquid phenomena can occur at some period of the 
drying process. Several liquid clusters can appear in the porous media. For each trapped liquid 
cluster, the liquid evaporated from smaller throats can only be replaced by the liquid of the 
biggest throat of the corresponding cluster because there is no connection between trapped 
clusters.



Chapter 2 Problem  Formulation 19

The liquid inside the pores have priority to evaporate in each cluster as soon as one of its 
connecting throats is empty because the pore radius is always bigger than that of its connecting 
throats due to the basic rule in construction of networks. If one o f the pore cormecting throat is 
the largest throat at the evaporating front, the pore has to be the biggest one after the liquid in 
that throat was evaporated. This will be taken as a rule in the present simulation.

2.2.3.3 Evaporation Rate at the Air-Liquid Interface

In the present model, liquid evaporation takes place at all pores having an air-liquid 
interface inside the porous medium during the drying process. The evaporated vapor are 
transported to the surface only by vapor difiiision. It should be noted that the porous medium is 
isothermal and that the liquid evaporation rate is controlled by the rate of difiiision, i.e., vapor 
transported by difiiision have to be balanced by vapor evaporated. The balance between difiiision 
and evaporation yields (Prata and Sparrow, 1988)

where is the vapor density at the air-liquid interface, Uyj is the vapor velocity, p is the mixture

Equation (2-11) will be used to calculate the evaporation rate at the interface between the 
external flow and the porous medium.

2.2.3.4 Diffusion o f Vapor

The vapor difiiision takes place between two adjacent empty pores while the connecting 
throat is empty. It is assumed that the vapor difiiision between empty pores can be treated as an 
one-dimensional binary difiiision. Thus, the difiiision of vapor can be described by Fick's law

where, except for which is the vapor flux density, all other symbols appearing in equation (2-

Dififusivities of gases at low density are almost composition independent, increase with the 
temperature, and vary inversely with pressure. In the present work, the gaseous pressure in the 
porous medium is atmospheric pressure and the temperature virtually constant. Therefore, the 
binary diffusion coefBcient, will be assumed constant.

2.2.3.5 Partial Pressure o f Vapor within the Pores

During the drying process, the pores can have only two states: full o f liquid or empty. For 
a full pore, it is not necessary to calculate the partial pressure of liquid because there is no vapor 
diffusion through it. But for empty pores, the situation is somewhat complex because the 
connecting fiill throats could belong to different trapping clusters. There are two possible 
situations and the way to determine the partial pressure of the vapor for each situation is different. 
Those situations will now be discussed.

1. Empty pore connecting with empty throats

In this case, the partial pressure of vapor in the pore is determined by the difiiision rate of 
adjacent throats. There is a mass balance that has to be satisfied and the vapor partial pressure can 
only be calculated by solving the difiiision equations o f adjacent throats all together. Note that the 
partial pressure o f this pore depends upon the four adjacent pores, that is, it is not an independent 
variable. This will be discussed later in more details.

2. Empty pore connecting with more than one fiill throats

The vapor partial pressure in the pore is not uniform. Consideration is given to an empty 
pore connecting with more than one fiill throats which belong to different trapping clusters. For 
each trapping cluster, the menisci radii of all throats which are on its border have to be the same, 
and is determined by the Kelvm's law. If there are difference o f menisci radii at the border o f a 
trapping cluster, there would be difference of Kelvin force between them. This force unbalance 
will cause liquid flow inside the trapping cluster until equilibrium is established. The menisci radii 
at the border will tend to be the same and equal to the radius o f the biggest fiill throat. In other 
words, the partial pressure of vapor at a trapping cluster have only one value and is determined by 
the biggest throat at the border.

the vapor partial pressure is determined by the balance between 

evaporating rate at interface and diffusion fluxes of empty throats

The vapor partial pressure at the menisci of the fiill throats which are cormected to the 
empty pore, thus, can have different value since they belong to different trapping clusters (Fig. 2- 
4). Kelvin's equation can then be used to determine the vapor partial pressure at the border of 
each trapping cluster. The vapor partial pressure at the center point of the empty pore (Py) can be 
calculated by mass balance assuming an equilibrium state. One should recall Kelvin's equation,

The vapor evaporated from the evaporating front inside the porous medium is transported 
to the top open edge by diffusion through empty pores and throats. The vapor cannot be 
transported through a full throat by difiiision but evaporation-condensation mechanism. The 
vapor mass fraction in empty pores are not independent variables, but are determined by the 
diffusion fluxes o f neighbor empty throats. There is a mass balance for each empty pore that must 
be satisfied. The number of empty pores and throats change at each time interval, and, therefore, 
the resistance network for vapor difiiision change its form during the drying simulation.

For a square network, each pore is connected with four throats, i.e., the coordination 
number is four. Generally, we consider the situation sketched in Fig. 2-5. At a time interval At, 
the vapor mass balance for pore (i,j) is given by

-  (® i,jP u)'K j / At = Ih;? j -  + mf. -  m j_, (2-19)

where O;j is the vapor mass fraction in pore (iJ), rhy is the vapor flux in vertical throat (iJ) and

(i,j) is calculated from

2.2.4 Boundary Conditions for the Porous Medium

The boundary conditions at the interface for the external flow have already been given in 
equation (2-4)-(2-9). For the porous medium model, the boundary conditions at the interface 
between the external flow and the porous medium is somewhat simple. The throats adjacent to 
the interface were considered either fiill or empty. For full throats, equation (2-11) is used to 
obtain the evaporation rate and for empty throats, equation (2-12) is used to calculate the 
diffusion flux. The coupling between the external flow and the internal flow will be discussed in 
more details in the next Chapter.

The situation inside the porous medium is more complex, since the problem encompasses 
phase change, that is, there is an evaporating front inside the porous medium. Different from the 
macroscopic model, this evaporatmg front is not plane but has a complex geometric form. 
Moreover, the evaporating front changes its form and place during the drying process. At late 
drying periods, the formation of liquid clusters complicates the situation. Clearly, one can not 
expect to deal with the continuous change of the evaporating front during the drying simulation 
because it is difficult to calculate the diffusion fluxes of empty throats with a changing 
evaporating front inside the porous medium. This is the main reason that it is difficult to simulate 
the real transient process of drying. The form of resistance network for vapor diffusion has to be 
fixed in order to have a fixed boundary condition at the evaporating front. Therefore, the 
evaporating front is assumed to be fixed during a time interval. For each new time interval At, the 
position of the evaporating front for each cluster have to be updated to get the new resistance 
network for vapor diffusion. The vapor mass fraction at the evaporating front is the saturated 
value corresponding to each trapped cluster, i.e., the mass fraction at the border of one trapped 
cluster are the same and is determined by the radium of the biggest throat at its border.

After the formulation of the external flow problem, the introduction of the boundary 
conditions and the discussion of the microscopic model for porous medium explored in last 
chapter, the next step is to solve the governing equations numerically and to develop a simulator 
for the porous medium according to the microscopic model described foregoing. As have been 
discussed before, the external flow can be treated as a boundary layer problem and is a well 
studied subject. That is particularly true for the problem of the boundary layer over a flat surface 
(see for instance Schlichting, 1968). In the present work the main attention is focused on the flow 
pattern and the drying behavior of the porous medium, and on the coupling between the external 
flow and the internal flow. Most of the present chapter will be devoted to this purpose.

3 .1  N e t w o r k  Co n s t r u c t io n  f o r  t h e  P o r o u s  M e d iu m

The first task is to construct a network for the porous medium on which the microscopic 
model as discussed in section 2.2.3 can be applied. As have been mentioned in Chapter 2, the 
geometric structure of the porous medium is complex and drying strongly depends upon this 
structure. In this regard, it is very important to select an appropriate network model for studying 
the porous medium. Reconstruction of porous medium has been receiving much attention in 
recent years and the reader is referred to Fernandes (1994) and Adler (1992) for a more elaborate 
discussion on that. In the present work, the attention is not paid to the reconstruction of the 
porous medium. For simplicity, the network used here is a square network of pores and throats. 
Each pore is coimected to four throats. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is 
fixed, but the radii of pores and throats have a known distribution. In order to give a more real 
radii distribution of pores and throats to the network, experimentally measured data is used to 
obtain the parameters for the network construction. For a given porous medium, the volume of



C h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 2 7

pores of different radii can be measured, for example, by mercury porosimetry (Kloubek, 1981 
and van Brakel et al., 1981). The experimentally measured volume distribution of the sand-caulim 
medium to be used here is shown in Fig. 3-1. From this figure, the radii distribution of pores and 
throats is calculated.

Radii of pores (|j.m)

Fig. 3-1 Pore distribution of the sand-caulim mixture used 
as the porous medium in the present work (Quadri, 1988)

In a real porous medium, it is diflBcult to say what is pore and what is throat. Generally, 
the bigger voids inside the porous medium are treated as pores and the smaller voids are treated 
as throats. Indeed, it is unknown how much empty volume in a porous medium is pores or 
throats, since all empty volume can be treated either as pores or as throats. In the present work, 
the empty volume will be treated as spherical pores to obtain the radii distribution of the pores.

To facilitate the network construction, the isonumber method (Philippi, 1995) is used to 
obtain the distribution of pores radii, i.e., each class of pores has the same number of pores. From 
the data of volume fi'action of pores (Fig. 3-1), the accumulated pores number is calculated. The 
curve of accumulated pores number versus pores radii is drawn in Fig. 3-2. From this curve, ten 
classes of pores radii are obtained (Table 3-1).

Fig. 3-2 Accumulated pores number versus the pores radii

As have been mentioned before, the voids can be treated either as pores or throats. In 
other words, the distribution of the radii of throats should be the same of the pores. To obtain the 
radii distribution o f the throats, therefore, it is assumed that the throats have the same kind of 
distribution of the pores but have a different radii range. The radii range for the pores is 
14.3-178.2 jam and the radii range for the throats, thus, can be obtained by using a factor to aU 
classes (the factor is chosen between 0.5 -  0.9). The porosity of the network can be changed by 
using different factors and the distance between the pores. It should be noted that the network 
difRisive resistance for the vapor is assumed to be only due to the throats and that there is no 
resistance due to the pores; the pores resistance is somehow inserted into the throat resistance 
through an equivalent length. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is chosen to 
be large enough to avoid the intersection of two adjacent big pores. There may be an overlap of 
radii range of pores and throats, i.e., some throats may have a bigger radius than that of some 
pores. During the network construction, therefore, if a throat is found to be larger than one of the 
two pores at its end, it is randomly interchanged with other throat of the network.

3.2.1 Solution Procedure for the Porous Medium

3.2.1.1 Identification o f  Trapped Clusters and Location o f the Evaporating Front

In the present model, the trapped cluster phenomena is taken into account during the 
drying process. The evaporating front recedes gradually inward the porous medium and its form 
changes continually during the drying process. This evaporating front has to be located inside the 
network in order to calculate the vapor difiiision fluxes for the empty throats. Therefore, the first 
important step is to develop an algorithm to scan the trapped clusters within the network. The 
task of this scanning procedure is to find out the trapped clusters from the information of the state 
of pores and throats (empty or fiiU). Then, a number is given to each cluster to identify it since 
liquid evaporated from each cluster can be taken off only from the corresponding cluster. In fact, 
the cluster phenomena takes places soon after some of the throats adjacent to the external 
interface are dried. Clearly, it strongly depends on the radii distribution of throats in the porous 
medium. The more the smaller throats are located near the surface, the sooner the clusters appear.

Other task to be achieved is to identify the throats which are located on the boundary of 
each cluster. It is on those throats that evaporation and condensation take place. As drying 
proceeds, the number of clusters and their boundary change. It is necessary, therefore, to run the 
program at each time interval to update the information about the trapped clusters and the 
evaporating front. The algorithm for scanning clusters and some illustrative results will be 
presented in Chapter 4, together with its validation.

3.2.1.2 Diffusion Fluxes in Resistance Network

After the clusters have been identified and the evaporating front has been located, the next 
step is to determine the diffusion flux in each empty throat. This is attained by solving equation 
(2-30) on the resistance network for the vapor difflision with the prescribed boundary conditions 
at the interface (profile of mass fraction for the external flow near the interface) and the 
evaporating front (saturated mass fraction at the menisci surface of the throats which are on the 
border of the trapped clusters).

It is well known that equation (2-30) which gives the mass fraction of pore(i,j) can be 
written in two different formulations, explicit and implicit, depending on which time the mass 
fraction of the neighboring pores are determined. If the values used are those of the last iteration



Chapter 3 Solution M ethodology 30

(known), the equation is an explicit one. In this case, the equation for each pore is independent of 
the other equations and can be solved one by one. If the values used to evaluate the mass fraction 
of the neighboring pores are those of the present iteration (unknown), the equation is implicit. In 
this formulation, it is necessary to solve a linear system of equations to determine the mass 
fraction for each pore. A solution of this system of equations can be obtained by a direct or 
iterative way. Some direct methods are; Matrix inversion, elimination of Gauss, Fourier 
transformation, etc. The iterative methods are: Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel, Successive Over- 
Relaxation (S.O R.), etc. (Patankar, 1980, Press et al., 1992). Clearly, the explicit formulation is 
simpler to be adopted than the implicit one. However, the convenience of the explicit method is 
offset by a serious limitation: the time step At for each iteration have to be small enough to ensure 
stability. In present model, the implicit scheme is adopted and it is assumed that the vapor 
diffusion between the empty pores in the porous medium is in equilibrium, i.e., the vapor entering 
an empty pore is equal to the vapor leaving the pore during a time interval At. To this extent 
equation (2-30) is simplified as

® +  8M,j® i-i,j +  +  g fj-i® i,j-i) / GSUM (3-1)

where

G S U M = .g ,&gt; g .&gt; :,.+ g 5 + g » _ , (3-2)

The mass fraction of each empty pore is calculated one by one in the resistance network 
for vapor diffusion by using the equation (3-1). This is done iteratively, and convergence is 
reached rapidly. After convergence has been reached, the mass fraction of the vapor in the empty 
pores is taken to be constant during the drying time interval, in accordance with the implicit 
scheme. Thus, during At the vapor fluxes to and from the pores are taken to be constant.

The next step is to obtain the evaporation (or condensation) rate on the border of each 
cluster. In fact, the evaporation (or condensation) rate of the fiill throats which are on the border 
of the clusters is obtained when the resistance network for vapor diffusion is solved. To obtain the 
evaporation rate of a cluster, one just needs to sum the evaporation rate o f the throats on its 
border. It should be noted that some of the throats are evaporating and some condensing (Fig. 3- 
3a). It is defined here that the evaporation rate is positive and the condensation rate is negative. 
Thus, if the sum of the evaporation rate is positive, it means that this cluster is losing liquid by 
evaporation. If the sum is negative, the cluster is gaining liquid by condensation. The amount of 
liquid evaporated from each cluster in a given time interval can be obtained muUiplying the 
evaporation rate by the time interval. It is worthy mentioning that an empty pore can lie on the 
border of various clusters, as indicated in (Fig. 3-3b).



C h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology SI

The condensing throats at the border of the clusters are marked in order to distinguish 
them from the evaporating throats. It is important to do so because, of course, the evaporated 
liquid of a cluster cannot be removed from a condensing throat even if it is the biggest throat on 
the border of cluster. This will be a rule in choosing the biggest throats on the evaporating front.

Fig. 3-3 (a) pore on the border of one cluster
(b) pore on the border of three clusters

3.2.1.3 Determination o f the Time Interval

At each time interval, it is assumed that the network is in an equilibrium, that is, the mass 
fraction at the empty pores and the diffusion fluxes through the empty throats remain constant. 
Clearly, the time interval used to calculate the quantity of the Uquid evaporated from each cluster 
has a great influence on the drying process simulation. The smaller the time interval, the better the 
approximation of drying process. Generally, the problem becomes independent of the time interval 
if liquid o f only one or two throats and pores is removed in each time interval. The time interval is 
not fixed during the simulation because the drying rate decreases sharply after the interface is 
dried. Since the evaporating rate is bigger at the earlier times, the time interval starts with a small 
value, and with the receding of the evaporating front, the evaporating rate decrease and bigger 
time intervals can be used to accelerate the marching procedure.

If the time interval were chosen arbitrarily, it could happen that some small clusters would 
have less liquid to be removed than that that would be evaporated from them during the time 
interval. To avoid this problem, the time interval is chosen as following.



C h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 32

• after the clusters and their borders are located, the evaporation (or condensation) rate for 
each cluster is calculated

• the amount o f liquid in each cluster is obtained
• for each evaporating cluster, the time to evaporate all liquid o f cluster is calculated
• the smallest time is chosen to be the time interval and is used for all clusters to calculate 

the amount o f liquid evaporated or condensed

In this way, it is ensured that all clusters have sufficient liquid to be removed in each time 
interval. At the begiiming of simulation, the network is saturated , i.e., there is only one cluster in 
the network and it is obvious that one cannot choose the time to evaporate all liquid in this cluster 
(the whole sample) as the first time interval. To avoid a too big time interval at the beginning and 
during the simulation, a criterion is used to control the maximum time interval for different drying 
stages. The time interval increases gradually as drying proceeds since the drying rate decrease for 
larger times.

3.2.1.4 Removal o f  Liquid from Clusters

So far, it is known how much liquid is evaporated firom the border of each cluster and 
transported to the surface of porous medium or, reversely, how much vapor is condensed to each 
cluster during a time interval At. The attention now is turned to the removing o f the liquid fi’om 
each cluster. The questions are how to remove the evaporated liquid fi’om each cluster, when and 
where the liquid removing process stops.

Inspection is carried out from left to right and from top to bottom o f the network during 
the liquid removal process. If there is only one biggest throat at the evaporating front of each 
cluster in each time interval, there is no doubt that this throat loses its Uquid first. Difficulties 
appear when there are more than one biggest throat on the cluster border at the same time 
interval. One has to determine, thus, from which throat the liquid should be removed first. 
According to the mechanism for liquid transfer of the present model (capillarity), the biggest 
throats can lose their liquid because they have the same radius, regardless of their location on the 
cluster border. There are various ways to remove the evaporated liquid from each cluster. For a 
given cluster, for example, the first biggest throat encountered at the cluster border during the 
inspection can be chosen as the throat from which the liquid is removed first. As soon as the liquid 
of this throat is removed, the liquid of the connecting pore is also removed because, as have been 
mentioned before, the pores have priority to evaporate. After the liquid from the pore is removed, 
other three connecting throats become located on the evaporating front. The removal process for 
this throat can stop and the inspection goes on, or, the process can only stop when the radii of the



0 • a &amp;lt;4 ^  -  I
Chapter 3 Solution Methodology 33

three connecting throats are smaller than that of the other throats that lie on the border. The way 
employed to simulate the drying process, of course, can affect the simulation result in a significant 
extent. Since only a little amount of liquid (of one or two throats or pores) is removed from a 
cluster in a time interval, this influence is strong. The left top part of the porous medium will be 
dried more rapidly than the right part because the inspection routine is always started from the left 
top part of the network.

In the present model, the liquid removal from a given evaporating cluster is performed by 
the following steps:

1. The biggest throat radius is obtained by comparing the radii of the evaporating throats 
on the border of cluster. The condensing throats are not considered during the 
inspection.

2. The first biggest fiill throat encountered on the border of a cluster during the 
inspection is taken as the first throat from which the liquid is removed.

3. The liquid of this throat is removed if it is an evaporating throat. Contrarily, the 
inspection goes on to encounter the next biggest throat.

4. After the liquid of this throat is removed, the liquid within the pore which is 
connected to the biggest throat (at other end) is removed.

5. The other three fiill throats are marked as the throats on the border and the liquid 
removal process in this throats stops.

6. The inspection goes on to find out other biggest fiiU throat on the border.
7. Steps 1-6 is repeated until all the evaporated Uquid is removed from this cluster.

ff the given cluster is a condensing one, condensed Uquid is given to it by the foUowing
steps:

1. The biggest throat radius is obtained by comparing the radu of the throats on the 
border of cluster, regardless of it is evaporating or condensing.

2. The first biggest fiiU throat encountered on the border of the cluster during the 
inspection is taken as the throat on which the condensed Uquid is put.

3. The Uquid is given to this throat, and what is changed is the amount of the Uquid in 
the throat. The meniscus position is considered the same.

For simpUcity, the Uquid volume within the throats is calculated considering a plane 
menisci surface.



C h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 34

The liquid removal process is performed cluster by cluster until all of the evaporated liquid 
is taken off from the evaporating cluster and the condensed liquid is placed on the condensing 
cluster.

For an evaporating cluster, the amount of evaporated liquid during a time interval is hardly 
equal to the amount of liquid in the chosen throats and pores. At the end of the time interval, the 
amount of evaporated liquid to be removed may be less than that of a biggest throat or a pore. 
Under this circumstance, some liquid is left in the throat or pore after the evaporated liquid is 
taken off from this throat or pore. If this occurs for a throat, the throat is treated as a fixll one in 
the next iteration but the quantity o f liquid in it is less than before. Thus, the meniscus will not be 
at the end of the throat. Instead, the meniscus recedes inside the throat as shown in Fig. 3-4a. For 
a throat having two empty pores at its ends (liquid bridge), the menisci of both side recede inside 
the throat (Fig. 3-4b). It should be noted that evaporation-condensation mechanism can take place 
at this kind of throats. In fact, the liquid bridge in the throat is a small trapped cluster. For a big 
trapped cluster, the evaporation-condensation mechanism can also take place because one can 
look all trapped clusters as liquid bridges. The difference is that for a small trapped cluster (one 
throat), there is only one evaporating meniscus and one condensing meniscus, for a big trapped 
cluster, however, there may be various evaporating and condensing menisci.

(a)

Fig 3-4 Diagram showing the possible position of menisci of throat

As have been shown in Fig 3-4, there are various possible positions for menisci inside the 
throats. Regardless o f where the menisci are, this kind of throat is treated in the same manner as a 
completely fiill throat in the next time interval, and the evaporating rate at receded menisci is 
obtained in the same manner of that at menisci at the ends of throat.

If the liquid removing process is terminated in a pore and the amount of liquid left to be 
removed is less than the existing amount o f liquid within this pore (Fig. 3-5), then the evaporated 
liquid is removed from this pore and this pore is treated as an empty one in the next iteration. The 
fiill throats connected to this pore are taken to be on the evaporating front in the next iteration. 
This kind of pore will be taken as the first one to be evaporated in next iteration, that is, it is



Chapter 3 Solution M ethodology 35

treated as the biggest throat on the evaporating border at the next time interval. It should be noted 
that in the last time interval, this pore and its three connected fiill throats belong to the same 
cluster. As it becomes an "empty" pore during the next time interval, it no longer link the three 
fiiU throats. In this circumstance, the three fiill throats may be in three different clusters. 
Considering that the vapor diffiision flux in the empty throat is the result of evaporation from 
three full throats, the liquid left in this pore should be distributed among the dijBFerent clusters to 
which the three throats belong. The liquid left in this pore, is then equally divided and distributed 
among the different clusters.

Fig. 3-5 Diagram o f pore with left liquid

All procedures performed during a time interval within the porous medium is completed at 
this point. Next, the network is inspected again to identify trapped clusters and evaporating fronts 
for the next time interval. To obtain the vapor fluxes in the resistance network, a new boundary 
condition has to be given at the interface between the porous medium and the external flow. 
Therefore, the mass fraction field of the external flow should be updated. The calculation o f the 
mass fraction in the external flow will be explored next.

3.2.2 Solution for External Flow

The mathematical model for external flow is given by equations (2-l)-(2-3). To solve 
those differential equations, use is made o f the control volume methodology due to Patankar 
(1980). In this methodology, the calculation domain is divided into a number of nonoverlapping 
control volumes such that there is one control volume surrounding each grid point (Fig. 3-6). The 
governing equation is then integrated over each control volume and a set of algebraic equations is 
obtained as explored in the next section.

profiles expressing the variation of the variables of interest (such as U^, Uy and o , etc.) between 
adjacent grid points are used to evaluate the required integrals. The outcome is algebraic 
equations containing the value of the variables of interest for a group of grid points. The value of 
the variable in each control volume is taken as constant and equal to the value of the grid point at 
the center o f control volume.

Equation (2-2) and (2-3) can be written in the general form as

where the (j) is the general variable (Ux, Uy and co, for example), F is the diffusion coefficient and 
the S is the source term. The two-dimensional discretization equation for this general differential 
equation can be written as (for the details of discretization, one can refer to Patankar, 1980)

ap(j)p = aE(|)E + aw&lt;l)w + ^ (3-4)

where

here the operator [1 A, B |] denote the greater of A and B, the superscript ® denote the known

The mass flow rates, conductances and Peclet numbers for other three faces of a typical 
control volume are defined in the same way. The interpolation fiinction A (p ) can be selected

from various schemes such as central difference, upwind, hybrid, power law and exponential 
(Patankar, 1980). Here, the power law scheme is adopted, in which,

a ( |p |) = [| 0 , ( l - 0 . l |P |) '  I] (3 - 1 5 )

Note that the discretzation form of the general differential equation can be used to solve 
the transient problem. In our work, it is assumed that the external flow has reached a steady state 
in each drying time mtemal. Under this circumstance, we just let the At in equation (3-11) tends 
to infimte, yielding, a  ? equal to zero. The information of the mass transfer of the internal flow 
(porous medium) is passed to the external flow through the source term in equation (2-3). This 
will be discussed in more details in section 3 .3.

3.2.2.2 Solution o f  the Algebraic Equations

The solution of the set of algebraic equations for an one-dimensional situation can be 
obtained by the standard Gaussian-elimination method. Sometimes, it is called the TDMA 
(TriDiagonal-Matrix Algorithm). The designation TDMA refers to the fact that when the matrix 
of the coefficients o f these equations is written, all the nonzero coefficients align themselves along 
three diagonals of the matrix. For the two-dimensional situation, direct method (i.e., these 
requiring no iteration) for solving the algebraic equations are much more compUcated and require 
rather large amounts of computer storage and time. For a linear problem, which requires the 
solution of the algebraic equations only once, a direct method may be acceptable, but in nonlinear 
problems, since the equations have to be solved repeatedly with updated coefficients, the use of a 
direct method is usually not economic. Thus, the line by line method which combines the direct 
method (TDMA) for one dimensional ( for a chosen grid line) and the Guauss-Seidel method is 
used, To carry the information of the boundary conditions into domain more rapidly, the TDMA 
can be carried out in the grid line by line forward, then backward and column by column 
downward, then upward and so on.

For the solution of the algebraic equation associated to the differential equation (2-3), 
there is no difficulty in determming the source term because the evaporation rate at the interface is 
known from the solution of the network. However, difficulty arises in the calculation of the 
source term for the velocity field, that is, the unknown pressure field. This is so because there is 
no obvious equation to obtain the pressure field. The pressure field is indirectly specified via the



C h a p te r s  Solution M ethodology 39

continuity equation (equation (2-1)). When the correct pressure field is substituted into the 
momentum equation, the resulting velocity field satisfies the continuity equation.

Here, the SIMPLER algorithm is used to calculate the velocity field. It consists of solving 
the pressure equation fi'om a guessed velocity field to obtain the pressure field and solving a 
pressure-correction equation only to correct the velocities (for more details, see Patankar, 1980, 
1981).

For the problem of convective drying of porous medium such as sketched in Fig. 2-1, one 
should pay attention to the coupUng of the external and the internal flow. Generally, for the 
convective drying of the porous medium, the scale of external flow is different firom the scale of 
internal flow. As have been discussed in Chapter 1, in macroscopic model o f porous media, the 
variables of interest are not representative of transfer at the pore scale but of transfer at the scale 
of small volumes containing a sufficient nimiber of pores (R E. V ). Clearly, the scale of such kind 
of models is bigger than that of the external flow model. Under this circumstance, there are some 
doubt on the classic coupling method of external flow with internal flow. Plumb and Prat (1992) 
studied the size o f R.E.V. of the porous medium, and they found that the Representative 
Elementary Volume for mass transfer is larger than that traditionally accepted for properties such 
as porosity and dry diffiisivity.

In the present microscopic model for the porous medium, there is no doubt about scale 
because the equations used to describe the drying are derived at the pore scale. In other words, 
the variables for the porous medium are evaluated in the same scale of the variables for the 
external flow. This is one of the main advantages of using the microscopic model for the porous 
medium.

In the drying problem under consideration, the surface of the porous medium is flat. 
Regarding the computer storage capacity and reasonable computer time, the network size of 
pores and throats for the porous medium will not be bigger than 100x100 in the present 
simulation. The grid for the external flow could be of the same size or smaller. The control 
volume at the interface, for instance, can couple with one or various throats as shown in Fig. 3-7. 
The internal flow problem is solved separately fi'om the external flow problem, and the coupling 
of the two problems is made by passing the information either of the evaporation rate of fiill 
throats or vapor flux of empty throats to the control volumes adjacent to the external flow via 
source term in equation (2-3). That is, the vapor transported into the external flow through the



Chapter 3 Solution M ethodology 40

interface is treated as it is generated in the control volume adjacent to the interface. Thus, the 
interface is taken as impermeable during the solution of equation (2-3). Equation (2-11) is used to 
calculate the evaporation rate of a fiill throat on the interface. The derivative of the mass fi'action 
in equation (2-11) is calculated in different ways depending if the throat is fiill or empty. The two 
cases are shown in Fig. 3-8. For the external flow, the mass fi’action is taken to be uniform along 
each control volume and is evaluated in its center as shown in Fig. 3-8. The distance used to 
obtain the derivative of the mass fi’action, therefore, is somehow arbitrary.

Fig. 3-7 Coupling of grid for external flow with the network

Fig. 3-8 Diagram of throats on interface



C h a p te rs Solution M ethodology 41

For full throats, the distance used here is that between the center point of the control 
volume and the surface of the meniscus (at the interface or receded meniscus). The mass fraction 
at the meniscus (saturated) can be calculated using equations (2-14)~(2-18). For empty throats, 
the vapor flux is calculated using equation (2-12). The distance employed to obtain the derivative 
of the mass fraction is that from the center of the control volume to the center of the empty pore.

The boundary condition at the interface for equation (2-2) is the no-slip assumption 
together with the blowing velocity given by equation (2-12). The interface is treated as an 
impermeable one for equation (2-3).

It is worthy mentioning that the two-dimensional grid used to solve the external flow, in 
fact, has an unity thickness in the z-direction. If the network for the porous medium is two- 
dimensional, i.e., the throats are rectangular and the pores are cylindrical, the network can be 
taken as a network with an unity thickness in z-direction as shown in Fig. 3-9. Thus, the interface 
of both the external flow and the porous medium have the same thickness. To calculate the vapor 
transported into the control volume, the intersection area of the rectangular throat (shaded area) 
is used.

Fig. 3-9 Coupling of a 2D grid with a 2D network of rectangular throats
and cylindrical pores

However, for a two-dimensional network of cylindrical throats and spherical pores, the 
network thickness has a certain value (the radius of the largest pore, for example). Under this 
circumstance, the intersection area of the throats on the interface is their sectional area (darken



Chapter 3 Solution M ethodology
42

area m Fig. 3-10), but the control volume for external flow has an unity thickness. Clearly, the 
sectional area of the interface for the external flow and the network is incompatible. Thus, the 
mtersection area for the network at the interface have to be modified to make it compatible with 
the control volume of the external flow. To do so, the diffiision rate of empty throats and the 
evaporation rate of full throats at the interface are modified from the sectional area of throats to 
the square area with a width o f the diameter of the throats. Thus, the vapor transported into the 
control volume is calculated by multiplying the modified vapor diffusion or evaporation rate by 
the rectangular area with a width of the diameter and a thickness of unity (shaded area).

Fig. 3-10 Coupling of a 2D grid with a 2D network o f cylindrical throats
and spherical pores

Of course, one could have made the control volume compatible to the network by 
reducing the thickness o f the control volume in z-direction fi-om unity to the same thickness of the 
network.

4.1 In t r o d u c t io n

The trapped clusters phenomenon in the latter period of the convective drying problem has 
to be taken into account in the numerical simulation due to its great influence on the liquid phase 
distribution in the porous media. Because of this phenomenon, the evaporating front inside the 
porous medium has a complex form that changes during the drying process. In Chapter 3, it was 
described how the evaporated (or condensed) liquid of each cluster in a time interval can be taken 
off or put on. Therefore, the trapped clusters in the network should be identified, labeled and the 
evaporating front should be located in each time interval. To perform this process in the numerical 
simulation, an algorithm was developed.

The infinite and finite cluster in an infinite network is a general concept of percolation 
theory. The dynamic and static aspects of percolation phenomena are well known and to a large 
extent understood. The concept of percolation has been closely associated with the permeation of 
fluid through porous media. The formation of an infinite cluster of identical molecules in a 
network can also be described within the framework of percolation theory.

The algorithm for locating clusters in a network is discussed here as a chapter because it is 
not only usefiil for the present convective drying problem, but also for other situation. Various 
examples of phenomena that need this kind of algorithm are encountered in the literature. These 
include among others: spontaneous magnetization of dilute ferromagnets (Elliott et al., 1960), 
spreading of diseases in orchards (Broadbent et al., 1957), formation of polymer gels (Flory, 
1953), electrical conductivity of amorphous semiconductors and metal-ammonia solutions 
(Eggarter et al., 1971 and Cohen et al., 1976), distribution of grain size in photographic emulsions 
(Kottler et al., 1950), and exciton percolation in isotopically disordered crystals and



Chapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 44

photosynthetic units (Kopelman et al., 1975 and Kopelman, 1976). It should be noted that this list 
includes only a small "random sample" of a variety of percolation process occurring in nature.

Various mathematical and computational approaches to the problem, including their scope 
and limitations, have been outlined in numerous papers and review articles (Frisch et al., 1963, 
Fisher, 1964, Essan, 1973). Computational methods broadly termed as Monte Carlo methods 
(Broadbent et al, 1957) are applied to finite sublattices whereas percolation theory, basically, is 
concerned with the probabihty for locating an infinite cluster in an infinite lattice.

The difficulties encountered in a solution of a percolation problem utilizing the direct 
simulation approach are the limitation of computer storage capacity and computer speed. Hoshen 
and Kopelman (1976) developed a "cluster multiple labeling technique" to save storage and 
computer time. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the 
same cluster. This technique algorithm is briefly described in the following.

The first time an marked site (it could be a site occupied by a certam molecule, or, a fiiU 
pore, etc.) is encountered during the inspection of the lattice the label counter k is set to an initial 
value k(). The increment Ak is a small positive integer. For the site /, its neighbors are searched 
first. Generally, the neighbors of site / are defined as those sites connected by bonds to site i. The 
number of neighbors is equal to the bond order of site /. If there are no labeled neighbors in the 
vicinity of site /, the site is assigned a new label after k is incremented. If there is only one labeled 
neighbor, site / gets the same label of its neighbor. The unique features of the cluster multiple 
labeling technique become apparent when there are more than one labeled neighbors, that is, the 
site / links two or more previously labeled cluster fi^agments into a single cluster. No site 
belonging to any of these cluster fragments is relabeled and it retains its original label throughout 
the inspection process. The actual readjustments occurs within the number counters of these 
clusters. All the labeled sites of these clusters is added to the cluster which has the smallest cluster 
number and the nimiber counters of these clusters are set to a negative integer (with the same 
number o f the smallest cluster number). With this readjustment, these clusters are coalesced into a 
new larger cluster without relabeling. Site labeling and cluster size classification can be 
accomplished by a single scan of the lattice. The additional advantage of the single scan process is 
that only a fraction of the columns (or layers) have to reside in the computer memory 
concurrently. The entire lattice need not to be stored on the computer because after a segment of 
columns (or layers) have been processed they are not referred to again by the program.

The idea of "cluster multiple labeling technique" can be used in the present algorithm. It 
should be mentioned that this algorithm requires not only the ability of locating and labeUng the 
clusters in a square network, but also the ability of locating the pores and throats which are on the



Chapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 45

evaporating or condensing front of each cluster. The algorithm developed by Hoshen and 
Kopelman (1974), which uses the "cluster muhiple labeling technique", labels a same cluster using 
various number. Difficulties will arise at later drying stages if a cluster is labeled with more than 
one number, and Hoshen and Kopelman algorithm has to be altered for the same cluster to be 
labeled with only one number; the number o f clusters in the network should be then a set of 
natural numbers.

4 .2  S c a n n in g  t h e  C l u s t e r

As have been pointed out, the clusters in the porous medium have to been located for each 
time interval. Therefore, a subroutine SCANCLUSTER was developed specially to perform this 
task. The subroutine is required not only to locate the clusters in the porous medium but also to 
give a natural number (label) to each cluster. This subroutine was written for a network of pores 
and throats (the bond order is four), but it could be used to other kind of network after some 
modification. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 4-1. The scanning process is done row by row, from 
left to right and from top to bottom of the network. The first time a fijll throat or pore is 
encountered during the inspection of the network, the label counter k is set to an initial value k?  
(normally ko equal to 1). Three matrix are used to store the label number, one for pores, one for 
vertical throats and another for horizontal throats.

The network used to represent the porous medium in the present work is a square 
network of pores and throats. For the problem of convective drying shown in Fig. 2-1, on the 
border of the network there are only throats (Fig. 3-6). The scanning process is done pore by 
pore, and for each pore the connecting throats are also scanned.

At the beginning of the scanning, pore (1,1) is checked. If it is frill, it is labeled with 1 and 
its four neighbor throats are labeled with the same number. This is so because it is assumed in the 
present model that the pore will be empty as soon as one of its four neighbor throats has been 
empty. As discussed earlier, this is a basic rule for the program. If the pore is empty, the fiall 
neighbor throats are labeled in sequence using different number with an increment Ak=l. Empty 
pores and throats are not labeled.

For the other pores of the first row, the neighbor throat of the left hand side does not need 
to be scanned because it has already been done in last pore. If the pore is fiall, the pore and other 
three neighbor throats are labeled with the same number of the left neighbor throat. If the pore is 
empty, the fiall neighbor throats of top, right and bottom are labeled having different numbers with 
an increment o f Ak= 1.

For the pores which are in the first column, the top neighbor throat is not scanned. The 
pore and other three neighbor throats are labeled with the same number of the top throat if the 
pore is fiill. Contrarily, the fiill neighbor throats of left, right and bottom are labeled using 
different numbers with an increment of Ak=l.

For the rest of pores, only the right and bottom neighbor throats are scaimed because the 
left and top neighbor throats have already been scaimed. If the pore is empty, the right and bottom 
neighbor throats are labeled with numbers different than that if they were fiill. There are two 
possibilities for a fiall pore. First, the left and top neighbor throats have the same number, then, the 
pore, right and bottom neighbor throats are labeled wdth this number. For the second possibility 
for a fiill pore, the left and top neighbor throats have different number. For this case, the pore and 
the two throats are labeled using the smaller number of the top and left neighbor throat. Note that 
this cluster that have different numbers for the left and top neighbor throats is really the same 
cluster, eventhough it is labeled with different numbers. It have to be re-labeled in a latter step 
because there should be an one to one correspondence between numbers and clusters.

After all fiall pores and throats are labeled, the next step is to change the number of 
clusters which were labeled with more than one number. A subroutine CLUSTER is written to do 
this job. Only fiiU pores is scanned during the inspection because an empty pore can not link a 
cluster. If it is found that the four fiall throats of a fiall pore have different numbers, they have to 
be relabeled, since they are in the same cluster, and the same cluster should have the same 
number. The smaller o f the numbers is found and all pores and throats which have the same 
number o f the other throats (bigger than the smaller number) in the network are relabeled using 
the smaller number. As a result, each cluster will have only one number after the subroutine 
CLUSTER is called. A problem that arises is that some natural numbers disappear during this 
process, and the cluster number is no longer in sequence. Clearly, there is no problem to identify 
the clusters if the clusters have different number, even if these numbers are not in sequence 
However, this is not convenient from a computational point of view because it is difficuh to use 
the DO LOOP command if the clusters numbers that are not in sequence. To overcome this 
difficulty, the subroutine CLUSTER is used again to rearrange the cluster number.

The subroutine CLUSTER is called when it is found that a natural number is absent. One 
of the cluster which has a cluster number bigger than the absent one is relabeled by using this 
number. This is repeated until no cluster number is bigger than the last natural number. The last 
natural number is the number of clusters in network.

The pores and throats which are on the border of each cluster are found and marked in the 
subroutine SCANCLUSTER. In fact, it is these throats that represent the evaporation front inside



C hapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 48

the network. This is an important information when evaporated liquid is taken off from each 
cluster. The biggest full throat from which the evaporated liquid is removed should be on the 
border o f each cluster. Therefore, the pores and throats which are on the border of each clusters 
are marked by 1, and the others by 0. By using this information associated to the cluster number, 
one can identify the evaporating (or condensing) border o f each clusters.

After subroutine SCANCLUSTER is called once, one know how many clusters are there 
in the network, which pores and throats are in the same cluster and which pores and throats of 
one cluster are on its border (evaporation or condensation front).

The subroutine SCANCLUSTER is fundamental in using the microscopic model. Its 
validity and efficiency, of course, has a strong influence on the simulation since it has to be used 
for each time interval. In what follows SCANCLUSTER will be used to scan some network 
demonstrating its validity and efficiency.

To illustrate the validity and efficiency of subroutine SCANCLUSTER. a network, shown 
in Fig. 4-2, containing 10x30 pores Aviil now be processed. The states of pores and throats are 
determined artificially according to the rule of our model. The fiill pores and throats are 
symbolized by 1, whereas the empty pores and throats have a symbol of 0.

In Fig. 4-2, the first row denotes the states of the vertical throats adjacent to the interface. 
The second row denotes the states of horizontal throats and pores alternatively, and so on. It can 
been seen fi’om the figure that there are some dry zone at the top of the network and that some 
liquid clusters are trapped in the dry zone. From this information, the subroutine 
SCANCLUSTER should find out how many liquid clusters are there in the network and give each 
cluster a natural number. The result is given in Fig. 4-3, and as is shown, the subroutine 
SCANCLUSTER can identify liquid clusters in the network correctly. The number of clusters in 
the network is 34.

and throats which are on the border of each cluster. This map is illustrated in Fig. 4-4. Note that 
the top surface is the interface between the porous medium and dry air flow. The throats on this 
surface are on the border, of course, but only the füll throats are marked. It is worthy to mention 
that the throats on the border are full and the pores on the border are empty.

Fig. 4-4 Number map of pores and throats which are on the 
border o f each cluster

Observing Fig. 4-3 and Fig. 4-4, one can easily find that the SCANCLUSTER correctly 
locates the pores and throats which are on the border of each cluster.

A correct execution of a subroutine do not imply its efficiency. Considering that this 
SCANCLUSTER will be used in a network bigger than 100x100, its efficiency is as important as 
its accuracy. Therefore, the SCANCLUSTER will now be used on various network to study its 
efficiency.

4.4 SCANCLUSTER E f f ic ie n c y

The SCANCLUSTER will now be used on various network to examine its efficiency. The 
computer is an IBM 3090. The efficiency of the SCANCLUSTER subroutine is clearly shown in 
Fig. 4-5, where the time required for locating and labeling the clusters in a network is plotted 
versus the number o f sites processed in network. Mere 8 seconds is required to process a network 
containing 10,000 (the number of clusters in this network is 298) sites illustrating the efficiency of 
the method. It should be noted that the 100x100 network contain 10,000 pores and 20,000 
throats. The actual number of sites processed for this network is about 30,000.

Site number processed

Fig. 4-5 A plot of the computer central-processor-unit (CPU) time 
versus the number of sites processed in a network o f 30x30 to 

100x100 pores; the number of clusters in each network is different.

It should be pointed out that the CPU time required to process a network not only depend 
upon the number o f sites in network, but also on the number of clusters. The CPU time required 
to process a network of 100x100 at the beginning of drying (corresponding less clusters), for 
example, is different from that of the same network at the later period o f drying (corresponding 
more clusters). Fig. 4-6 gives a example of the influence of the number o f clusters on the required 
CPU time.

Fig. 4-6 demonstrates that the number o f clusters in the network have a strong influence 
on the required CPU time. For a 100x100 network (containing 30,000 equivalent sites), it took



C hapter 4 Subroutine Scancluster 52

only 2 seconds to execute SCANCLUTER in presence of 14 clusters, and it took 11 seconds for 
413 clusters in the network. Considering that the maximum network which will be used to study 
the convective drying is 100x100 pores, the required CPU time is expected to be less than 30 
seconds.

All drying simulations to be explored were made on a two-dimensional network containing
4,000 throats and 2,000 pores (100x20). The pores are cylindrical and the throats are rectangular. 
The real size of the network is 6.0 cm (width) x 1.2 cm (depth). The thickness of the network is 
unity. The network is so chosen because the major interests here are focused at the beginning of 
the drying (near the interface of the porous medium and the external dry air flow). As have been 
discussed before, the dry pitches which appear at the very beginning o f the drying process have a 
great influence upon the transfer coefficients of the interface. If the network is chosen as a square 
one with the same number of pores and throats (a network of 50x50, for example), it has both 
width and depth of 3 cm. Although the sites that should be processed for each time interval of 
drying are practically the same for the two network, the 50x50 network needs a longer time to be 
dried entirely because it has a larger depth. The drying rate is very high at the beginning while the 
interface is wetted with liquid and decreases sharply after the interface is dried. Thus, a 50x50 
network needs more iterations for a simulation than a 100x20 network.

The radii classes of the pores and throats used to construct the network are listed in Table 
5-1. One can note that the size distribution o f the pores and throats is different from the data 
presented in chapter 3. The reason to modify the size distribution is that the porosity of the 
network is very small if the distance of two pores is large (600 iim, for example). On other hand, 
the network size will be too small if the distance of two pores is reduced.

The network is initially saturated with alcohol at room temperature (20 ^C). The boundary 
condition imposed on the open edge (the up side of the network) is the mass fraction of vapor 
equal to zero. The other three edges of the network are impermeable. The total pressure within 
the network is assumed to be atmospheric and the physical properties of alcohol used in the

Before considering the configuration sketched in Fig. 2-1, attention will focused on some 
behavior o f the microscopic model for porous medium, such as the influence of network 
formation, the Kelvin effect and the evaporation-condensation phenomenon in the network. 
Firstly, the influence of the network formation on the drying process is studied.

The network used in the microscopic model to represent the porous medium structure, as 
have been discussed in chapter 2, is constructed by placing pores and throats randomlv in a square 
array. The size o f pores and throats have a known distribution obtained from the experimental 
data. The networks constructed in this way have the same statistical characteristics such as 
porosity, number of pores and throats of each size class. However, the position of the pores and 
throats in the network can be different during the different construction because, as have been 
mentioned before, the pores and the throats are placed in the network randomly. Clearly, the 
networks constructed have some difference in a local view. The throats on the interface, for 
example, can have different sizes for different networks. This difference, as can be expected, will 
have an influence on their drying behavior. In this section the influence of network formation wiU 
be studied. All results to be presented in this section include the Kelvin effect.

5.1.1 Drying Kinetics

To study the influence of liquid phase distribution upon the drying performance, five 
networks were constructed by using the same pores radii and throats radii distribution. Both the 
pores and throats radii have ten classes within the range of 39-250 (xm and 32.7-208 [im 
respectively. The distance between the centers of two adjacent pores is 0.6 nrni. Each class of 
radius has the same number of throats or pores. The porosity of network is about 0.5. The drying 
process was simulated on these five networks under the same conditions. The drying kinetics 
resuhs are presented in Fig. 5-1. The results are plotted as saturation, s, of network (volume of 
liquid divided by empty volimie) versus drying time.

Drying Time (hours)

Fig. 5-1 Drying curves for five networks

It is seen from Fig. 5-1 that the drying curves for the five networks have the same 
characteristics. Although these five networks have the same geometrical size and the same 
distribution of the pores and throats sizes, the times which are needed to dry the networks to the 
saturation S=0.1 are different. The difference of the end drying times between the fastest one and 
the slowest one is about 20%. However, it was noted that the drying times can have a difference 
of more than 45% near the saturation S=0.4. The drying curves begin to deviate fi'om the 
beginning of the drying and the deviation increases with the drying process until the saturation



C h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions S6

reaches about 0.4. Clearly, the drying rates for each network are different during this period. 
Afler S=0.40, the drying curves become parallel, which implies that the drying rates tend to be the 
same for the five networks. Furthermore, an interesting evidence was noted. The network 2 dries 
more slowly than network 3 before S=0.6 but this tendency is then inverted after that. It seems 
that initially the drying rate of network 2 is small but is accelerated after S=0.6. To have a better 
look of it, the drying rate curves are plotted in Fig. 5-2.

5.1.2 Drying Rate

The drying rate in Fig. 5-2 is the drying time derivative of saturation (dS/dt). One can see 
clearly fi-om Fig. 5-2 that the drying rates are very high at the beginning of the drying process (the 
interface is completely wetted with liquid) and then, decrease very quickly. The difference of the 
drying rates for different networks appear soon after some area of interface is dried (formation of 
dry pitches at the interface). This difference increases with the reducing saturation and reaches the 
maximum near S=0.6. After S=0.4, the drying rates of the five networks tend to be the same. This 
is coincident with the observation of Fig. 5-1.

Observing the drying rates of network 2 and network 3 in Fig. 5-2, one can find that the 
drying rate of the network 2 decreases more rapidly than that of network 3 before S=0.70. Then, 
the drying rate o f network 2 and network 3 maintain constant with a higher drying rate of 
network 3. At the S=0.5, the drying rate of network 3 decreases again and becomes lower than 
the drying rate of network 2 which continue to be constant. This suggests that there are 
something occurring near the S=0.50 for network 3. In order to understand it better, the 
evaporating area inside the five networks during the drjdng process are presented in Fig. 5-3.

5.1.3 Evaporating Area in the Network

The evaporating area plotted in Fig. 5-3 is the sum of the border area of trapped clusters. 
It is obtained by summmg up all the sectional area of the throats which are on the border of each 
evaporating trapped cluster. One can note that the evaporating areas at high saturations are 
almost the same for five networks. This is so because the initial evaporating area is exactly the 
sectional area of the throats on the interface. For all five networks, there is a small difference in 
the evaporating area at the very begiiming of drying.

C h a p te r s  Results and Discussions

As drying proceeds, the trapped clusters in each network are not the same, i.e., the liquid 
phase distribution in the network during the drying simulation is different for each network. This 
difference results in different evaporating areas for the different networks. It is found, however, 
that the evaporating area curves for the five networks have the same characteristics as shown in 
Fig. 5-3. The evaporating area increase due to the formation of trapped clusters for S&gt;0.70. Then, 
the evaporating area oscillates and for S&lt;0.3 the evaporating area begin to decrease. The 
performance of the evaporating area curves will be discussed in more details latter with the liquid 
phase distribution maps.

It was also found that the evaporating area curves present a correspondence with the 
drying curves, i.e., the network which dries faster has a higher evaporating area than the network 
which dries slower. For the network 2 and 3, there is a peak on the evaporating area curves 
around S=0.4 and 0.6, respectively. As the evaporating area of network 2 begin to reach its peak 
value the evaporating area of network 3 begin to drop fi-om its peak value. The cross of the two 
curves take place near S=0.50. It was at this point that network 2 became to dry more rapidly 
than network 3 as seen fi-om Fig. 5-2. This suggests that the evaporating area inside the network 
plays an important role in determining the velocity of the drying process.

It is well-known that the drying rate decreases rapidly with the receding evaporating fi-ont 
into the porous medium. The evaporating area for network 3 reaches its peak value earlier than 
network 2. It means that the evaporation rate on the drying fi-ont for network 3 at the peak point 
should be higher than that of network 2. If the evaporating fi-ont recede uniformly, it should be 
nearer to the top for network 3 than for network 2 when the evaporating area reaches to the peak. 
As a result, the peak evaporating area should have a greater influence on the drying process for 
network 3. However, as seen fi-om Fig. 5-1, although with a lower evaporation network 2 dries 
more rapidly than network 3. This cannot be reasoned only with information o f the evaporating 
area because Fig. 5-3 only gives the size of the evaporating fi-ont but not its location. To obtain 
this information, liquid phase distribution maps are extracted during the drying simulation. From 
these maps, one can locate the evaporating fi-ont at each drying step.

5.1.4 Phase Distribution in the Network

Liquid phase distribution maps for network 1-5 are given in the Fig. 5-4 ~ 8. From those 
maps, the first thing to be noted is that the evaporating fi-ont is far fi-om being uniform, i.e., the 
evaporating fi-ont does not recede into the network as a flat surface. The form of the evaporating 
fi’ont is very complex and different for the five networks. Even for the network 1 whose 
evaporating area oscillate less than other networks as seen in Fig. 5-3, the evaporating fi-ont is far

from being flat. Dry pitches at the begirming of the drying can be seen in the maps. With the 
receding of the evaporating front away from the top, the form of the evaporating front become 
more and more complex due to the appearance of more liquid clusters and the formation of some 
frinicular drying zone.

The drying behaviors of network 2 and 3 can now be understood with the help of the 
liquid phase distribution maps. One can see that the top surface of network 1, 4 and 5 dried more 
rapidly than that of network 2 and 3. Their top surface are completely dried soon after S=0.70. 
For network 3, the top surface became completely dry only after S=0.60. For network 2, there is 
a liquid cluster on the top surface and it is completely dry only after S=0.40. The evaporating area 
of network 2 reached its peak value for S=0.40 because, the evaporation rate on the front kept a 
relatively high value due to this liquid cluster. This explains why network 2 dried more rapidly 
than network 3 even for later tunes. At a saturation of S=0.4, the evaporating front of network 2 
is nearer the interface than that of network 3. With a higher evaporation rate on the evaporating 
front and a larger evaporating area, network 2 dries more rapidly than the other networks.

From the liquid phase distribution maps, one can understand why the evaporating area 
decreases after S=0.30 for all networks. Funicular drying zones reaches the bottom edge of the 
networks near S=0.30, and the edge effect takes place. In other words, the evaporating front is 
limited to develop its form freely. The edge effect reduces the clusters in the network and, 
consequently, the evaporating area.

The drying rate presented in Fig. 5-2, in fact, is a combination of the evaporation rate on 
the evaporating front and the area o f the evaporating front. To illustrate the mass transfer at the 
top surface of the porous medium during different stages of simulation, local evaporation rate for 
network 2 and 3 are shown in Fig. 5-9 and Fig. 5-10.

5.1.5 Local Mass Fluxes at the Top Surface

From Fig. 5-9, it is found that the local mass fluxes of the vapor at the top surface 
decreases sharply after this surface is dried. The vapor fluxes at the wet surface is ahnost ten 
times bigger than the vapor fluxes at the dry surface. The mass fluxes at the top surface decrease 
with the receding evaporating front. For network 2, the wet pitch at the top surface maintain the 
global mass flux at a relatively high value. Going back to the drying rate curves in Fig. 5-2, one 
can observe that the drying rate curves for network 1, 2 and 3 have a feature that network 4 and 5 
do not have. For the formers, the drying rate decreases rapidly at the very begirming of drying and 
then keeps ahnost constant at a certain value. Then the drying rate drops sharply again to a lower

value at given saturation value. This saturation value where the second drop in the drying rate 
takes place, in agreement with Figs. 5-4 ~ 8 and 5-9 ~ 10, is exactly the value where the top 
surface becomes totally dried. The constant drying rate after the first drop for network 1, 2 and 3 
is different than the one that occurred earlier, which is determined by the wet area o f the top 
surface. The larger the wet area, the higher the global mass flux at the top surface. On other hand, 
the longer the top surface keeps wet, the longer the constant drying rate period is.

For network 4 and 5, the second drop in the drying rate is not as clear as that for other 
networks. From Fig. 5-7 and Fig. 5-8, one can find that the top surface becomes totally dried very 
quickly (before S=0.7). Their drying curves, thus, are smoother than that o f other networks.

It is worthy mentioning here that evaporation-condensation mechanisms were observed 
during all simulations, i.e., some clusters have a negative global evaporation rate around their 
border, although in a somewhat low extent. This was not reported by Prat (1993) because the 
Kelvin effect was not included m his drying model, i.e., all gas-liquid interface in his network are 
taken to be plane.

Motivated by the existence of evaporation-condensation inside the network Kelvin effect 
will now be explored.

The difference caused by the Kelvin effect, in terms of the driving force for vapor 
diffusion, i.e., the partial pressure of the vapor at the gas-liquid interface, is very small. According 
to the Kelvin's equation, the partial pressure of the vapor at a concave meniscus is lower than the 
partial pressure at a flat interface. The difference of the partial pressure increases with the 
decreasing meniscus radius. The variation of partial pressure of alcohol vapor with the meniscus 
radius is given in Fig. 5-11.

One can find that the difference o f the partial pressure between a flat interface (Pq) and a 
meniscus (Pj.) is very small for meniscus radius bigger than 0.1 iim. The size of pores and throats 
used in our network is much bigger than 0.1 jim, and, therefore, the Kelvin effect with regard to 
the driving force for vapor diffusion, can be neglected. However, for a drying model in which the 
gas-liquid interface is taken to be flat, the partial pressure of vapor at the gas-liquid interface in 
the network is uniform. In other words, vapor condensation, as have been reported by Prat 
(1993), can not take place at these interfaces because the vapor partial pressure at the interface is 
always the highest inside the network. For a drying model in which the gas-liquid interface has a 
certain curvature, although the difference of the saturated partial pressure at the interface caused 
by the difference of the curvature is very small, the condensation o f vapor in the network, as have 
been observed in the simulations, can take place during the drying sunulation. The interesting 
point is to investigate which role the condensation-evaporation mechanism plays during the 
simulation.

To Study the Kelvin effect on the drying kinetics, two drying models are used to simulate 
the drying behavior for the same network. One drying model takes into account the Kelvin effect 
(the gas-liquid interfaces have curvature) and the other takes the gas-liquid interfaces as flat. The 
five networks used here are the same of those used in the last section. The simulations are carried 
out under the same conditions o f the last section. Again, the external flow is not considered.

5.2.1 Drying Kinetics

The drying curves for the five networks using the two different drying models are 
presented in Figs. 5-12 - 1 6 . The first evidence that can be observed fi'om these figures is that the 
Kelvin effect has a different influence on a different network. For network 1 and 2, the difference 
in drymg time caused by the Kelvin effect is much larger than that for network 3, 4 and 5. The 
difference in drying time can reach more than 20% (for network 1) or less than 2% (for network 
4). For all networks used here, the drying tune for the two models is practically the same for 
S&gt;0.7. Deviations take place near S=0.50. After this point, the drying curves for the two models 
separate one fi-om the other.

The second evidence, which is more interest, is that the Kelvin effect can cause either a 
positive influence (accelerating the drying process) or a negative influence (reducing the drying 
process). This is somehow strange because, as one usually would expect, the Kelvin effect should 
always reduce the drying. For the two drying models used here, the boundary condition imposed 
on the top edge of the network is the same, i.e., the mass fraction of alcohol vapor is the zero. For 
the model which takes Kelvin effect into account, the saturated partial pressure of alcohol vapor



C h a p te r s  R esults an d  Discussions 71

at the gas-liquid interface inside the network is lower than that of the model which do not 
consider the Kelvin effect and should slow the drying process. However, one can find, from Figs. 
5-12 ~ 16, that the effect on network 1 and 5 (positive effect) is different than that on the network
2, 3 and 4 (negative effect). As have been explained before, the negative effect is easy to 
understand. Otherwise, the positive effect can not be explained only by the difference of the 
saturated partial pressure at the gas-liquid interface in the network. More detailed information 
inside the network are needed to explain why for some networks reducing the vapor pressure at 
the gas-liquid interface can accelerate the drying.

5.2.2 Drying Rate

The drying rate curves for the five networks are presented in Figs. 5 - 1 7 - 2 1 . It can be 
seen that the difference of drying rate coincides with the difference o f the drying time caused by 
the Kelvin effect. For network 1 and 2, the difference in drying curves obtained by using the two 
drying models is large, as seen from Figs. 5-12 and 5-13; the same occurs for the drying rate 
according to Figs. 5-17 and 5-18. For network 3, 4 and 5, the difference in the drying rate curves 
due to the Kelvin effect is small. The drying rate curves for the model without the Kelvin effect 
have the same characteristics of the drying rate curves for the model with the Kelvin effect, that 
is, the drying rate decreases rapidly to a certain value and then this value is maintained for a 
period. For network 1, 2 and 3, the second drop in the drying rate occurs for both models, 
whereas for network 4 and 5 the second drop is not clear on the drying rate curves. The 
occurrence of the second drop in the drying rate which indicates the moment, as have been 
discussed before, that the interface becomes totally dried, is not at the same saturation for the two 
different models. For network 1 (Fig. 5-17), the second drop on the solid line (with Kelvin effect) 
occurs earlier than that on the dashed line (without Kelvin effect), i.e., the interface dries more 
rapidly by using the model with Kelvin effect than by using the model without Kelvin effect. This 
implies that the liquid phase distribution is different during the simulation for the same network 
depending whether Kelvin effect is included or not.

Different than what was observed for network 1, for network 2 the second drop in the 
drying rate with Kelvin effect takes place later than without Kelvin effect. It means that the top 
surface kept partially wetted for a longer tune by using the model with Kelvm effect. As have 
been discussed in the last section, the wetted surface has a much higher evaporation rate than the 
dried surface. This difference o f evaporation rate at the top surface has a stronger influence on the 
drying kinetics than the difference of the saturated partial pressure caused by the curvature. As a 
resuk of the wet surface, the network dries more rapidly by usmg the model with Kelvin effect.

For network 3, the second drop in the drying rate occurs almost at the same saturation for 
the two curves. However, the dashed line maintain a lower value of drying rate after the first 
drop. This might be caused by the evaporating fi-ont area or the evaporating fi-ont position in the 
network.

There is almost no difference on the drying rate curves for network 4 and 5.

5.2.3 Evaporating Area in the Networli

The evaporating area for the five networks are plotted in the Figs. 5-22 ~ 26. It can be 
observed again that the curves of the evaporating area are very affected by the network. For 
network 1, around S=0.4 there is a peak on the curve for evaporating area when the Kelvin effect 
is absent while no peak is observed when the Kelvin effect is present. Contrarily, for network 2, 
the absence of the Kelvin effect cause the disappearance of the peak on the evaporating area 
curve. For network 3, 4 and 5, the curves of the evaporating area have the same feature for both 
models. From these figures, one can see that the evaporating area can be used to explain the 
drying times observed in Figs. 5-12 to 5-16. For networks 1 and 5 the drying times in absence of 
the Kelvin effect is shorter than those with Kelvin effect and the corresponding evaporating areas 
are larger. Also, for networks 2 and 3 the shorter drymg times observed with the Kelvin effect is 
in agreement with the larger evaporating areas. However, for network 4, in spite of the larger 
evaporating area observed in presence of Kelvin effect, the drying time is virtually unaffected by

the Kelvin effect as seen from Fig. 5-15. This remains to be understood, and some insight will be

5.2.4 Phase Distribution in the Network

The liquid phase distribution maps, obtained from the simulations on the five network 
using the drying model in which Kelvin effect is absent, are presented in Fig. 5-27 to 31. Figs. 5-4 
~ 8 are presented again to facilitate the comparison o f liquid distribution for the same network 
obtained by using the two different drying model. One can see that liquid is distributed differently 
for the same network at the same saturation. This means that the Kelvin effect changed the drying 
path in the network. For network 1 (Fig. 5-4 and Fig. 5-27), the liquid distribution in the network 
is somewhat similar before S=0.70. After S=0.70, in Fig. 5-4 (with Kelvin effect), the evaporating 
front receded from the top surface, thus, as have been discussed in last section, resulting a sharp 
decrease o f evaporation fluxes. In Fig. 5-27 (without Kelvin effect), there is some Uquid near the 
top surface until S=0.50. This keeps the evaporation fluxes at the top surface at a relatively high 
value, accelerating the drying process.

For network 2 (Fig. 5-5 and Fig. 5-28), what happened is contrary to that observed for 
network 1. In Fig. 5-5, the top surface became totally dry only after S==0.40. In Fig. 5-28, the 
interface was dried soon after S=0.60. The mfluence o f Kelvin effect on the drying kinetics caused 
by the difference o f liquid phase distribution is much stronger than that caused by the difference in 
saturated pressure at the gas-liquid interface. As a result, the network dries slowly even in the 
absence o f the Kelvin effect. This also explained the drying behavior of network 3.

From what have been discussed, one can conclude that the liquid phase distribution in the 
network during the drying process has a strong influence on the drying kinetics. The Kelvin effect 
has a strong or weak influence, depending on the network and on the maimer the drying path 
affects the kinetics (in fact, the phase distribution). This influence can be on increasing or 
decreasing the drying rate.

At this point one can go back to Figs. 5-15 and 5-25 and try to understand why the drying 
time for network 4 was unaffected by the presence of Kelvin effect in spite of the influence of 
Kelvin effect on the evaporating area as seen from Fig. 5-25.

First it should be observed that for network 2 and S=0.5 the evaporating area without 
Kelvin effect is larger than that with Kelvin effect. However, as shown by Figs. 5-15 and 5-28 for 
S=0.5, with Kelvin effect the top surface has wet patches contrary to the top surface without 
Kelvin effect which is totally dry. Thus, even through with Kelvin effect the evaporating area is 
smaller than that without Kelvin effect, the drying rate for network 2 at S=0.5 is higher for the 
former (with Kelvin effect) than for the latter (without Kelvin effect). This findmg evidences that 
the drying rate is affected by both the evaporating area and the resistance for the vapor diffusion 
from the gas-liquid interface to the top surface.

For network 4 with Kelvin effect, the evaporating area might be larger than that without 
Kelvin effect but the resistance for the vapor diffusion is smaller due to the phase distribution 
inside the network. The combination o f both effects, evaporating area and vapor diffiision 
resistance yields drying rate for network 4 that is unaffected by the presence or not of Kelvin 
effect as is observed in Figs. 5-15 and 5-20.

The stability of the evaporating front, as has been pointed out by Prat (1993), is important 
from the point o f view of the validity of the continuum or macroscopic approach. If the 
continuum approach is valid with the porous medium, the evaporating front should be relatively 
stable during the drying process because the porous medium is usually assumed to be isotropic, i. 
e., the properties o f the porous medium such as porosity, conductivity and permeability has the 
same value in any direction, at least at the scale o f the representative elementary volume (R.E. V).

From the phase distribution maps of all simulations, three main regions can be observed 
during the drying process (Fig. 5-32):

Fig. 5-32 Three mam regions in term of phase distribution

Dry region
There is no liquid in this region. The vapor is transported in the gaseous phase by 
vapor diffusion.

Unsaturated region
There are some temporary trapped liquid clusters where the liquid transport is the 
result o f a complex interaction between liquid transport within the trapped clusters 
and vapor diffiision in the surrounding gaseous phase. The evaporation-condensation 
mechanism (liquid bridge) takes place in this region.

Saturated region
The liquid transport occurs in the liquid phase due to capillary force.



C h a p te r s  R esu lts a n d  D iscussions 83

In fact, the evaporatmg front is formed by the evaporating throats on the border of the 
clusters. Its shape is quite complicated. Strictly speaking, there is an evaporating surface 
surrounding each temporary trapped cluster. In other words, the evaporating front is not a 
continuous surface but a region consisting of many separated evaporating surface. The term 
"evaporating front" used here is associated with the unsaturated region. The stability of 
evaporating front, therefore, refers to the stability (the relative depth) of this region.

Some fingering occurs after the evaporating front receded from the top surface. Although 
those fingering do not reach to the sample size, the evaporating front is far from being flat as 
assumed in many drying models encountered in the literature. The depth o f the evaporating front 
region (unsaturated region) tends to increase while the evaporating front recede from the top 
surface. One can find also that the number of trapped clusters increase as drying proceeds. Some 
example of the variation of the temporary trapped cluster number during the drying simulation are 
given in Fig. 5-33 and 5-34. It is clearly shown in the figures that the trapped cluster number 
increase rapidly with decreasing saturation. The trapped cluster number decrease at the end of 
drying because o f the bottom edge effect, as have been discussed before.

Similar phenomena have been observed by Masmoudi et al. (1992) and Prat (1993) in their 
experimental and numerical works. In the paper of Masmoudi et al., the liquid phase distribution 
was obtained using a transparent etched network (for more detail, one can refer to Lenormand et 
al., 1988). The liquid phase distribution in the network was photographed during the drying 
process. The influence o f gravity on the cluster size and on their number in the network was 
investigated by Masmoudi et al. and it was found that the shape of the evaporating front is fractal, 
and that depth o f the evaporating (invasion front, in that paper) depends clearly on the Bond 
number which is defined as

a

where Ap represents the density difference between the displacing and displaced fluids, the t is a 
typical pore size diameter and the o  is the interfacial tension. Their experimental results show that 
the number and the maximum size of the clusters tend to increase as Bond number decrease.

One interesting feature observed by Masmoundi et al. is the relative stability of the 
invasion front (cluster region). This stability is observed in the experiments with the micromodel 
when the gravity forces are not negligible. Such a stability is also observed in the numerical 
simulation results o f Prat (1993). As have been pointed out by Prat in his paper, the front stability 
could be explained in terms of the removal mechanism of the clusters through the action of



C h a p te r s  Results an d  Discussions 84

evaporation. In fact, there is no permanent trapped cluster in the network during the drying 
process. The small trapped clusters can be eliminated soon due to evaporation.

One can find also, fi"om the present simulation, that the depth of the evaporating front tend 
to increase while the evaporatmg front receded from the interface. According to Masmoudi et al., 
the reason for the increasing of the evaporating front depth should be associated with the 
decreasing of the evaporation rate in terms of a diminished power for the evaporation process 
(together with the diffusion process of vapor in the gaseous phase) to eliminate or erode the 
cluster.

The sharp decrease of the evaporation rate at the top surface after it becomes totally dry 
has been shown clearly in the present simulation. The present author agree with the explanation of 
Masmoudi et al. about the increasing of evaporating front depth. However, the evaporation- 
condensation mechanism was not concerned in their discussion. In the present author's opinion, 
the reducing of the evaporation process power is an important effect, but not the unique reason. 
The other reason for the increasing of the evaporating front depth, is the temporary condensing 
clusters. It has been confirmed in the present simulation that the evaporation-condensation 
mechanism takes place during the drying process. As have been shown in Fig. 5-33 and 5-34, the 
total cluster number and the condensing cluster number increase with the receding evaporating



C h a p te r s  Results and D iscussions 8S

front. The condensing clusters can not be eliminated in the network until they become evaporating 
ones. As a resuh, the evaporating front depth increase.

The place of condensing clusters in the network during the simulation process are given in 
Fig. 5-35 and 36. In these figures, the evaporating clusters are printed black and the condensing 
clusters red. One can see that the condensing clusters are always at the place where is surrounded 
by other clusters. There is no permanent condensing cluster in the network during the simulation, 
i.e., the cluster could be a condensing one in one drying time interval and become evaporating one 
in next drying time interval. As have been observed, the condensing clusters exist only when the 
place is surrounded by other evaporating clusters. Once after the place is open due to the 
elimination of some evaporating clusters around it, the condensing clusters change to be 
evaporating clusters and can be eliminated as time advances.

It should be reminded that gravity has not been taken into account in the present drying 
model. Generally, gravity becomes negligible when the pore size is small enough, that is, the 
capillary force is large enough comparing to the gravity force difference caused by the pores 
location in the network. In fact, the height of network used here is only 1.2 cm and the pore size 
range is 39 ~ 250 pun. The gravity force is not important for simulation.

In the paper of Masmoudi et al., the stability of the invasion front was discussed in terms 
of gravity by considering only the typical pore size (Bond number). It should be noted that the 
pore size distribution range has a great influence on the stability o f evaporating front. Generally 
speaking, for a network with a narrow pore size range, the evaporating front shoiild be more 
stable due to the small difference of capillary force. As an extreme example, the evaporating front 
should be flat for a network with an uniform pore size.

The experimental resuhs of Masmoudi et al. (1992) were obtained using a network 
containing about 10000 ducts with seven classes o f width (from 0.1 ~ 0.6 mm) distributed at 
random; gravity is not negligible for these pores. The network used in the present simulation has 
ten classes of pore and throat size. For a real porous medium, however, the pore size distribution 
range is quite large. The material used to obtain the pore size distribution in the present work, for 
example, has a pore size ranging from 5.0 to 170 |im. It can be expected that the evaporating 
front in a real porous medium should be wider than those observed here.

The complete configuration sketched in Fig. 2-1 will now be considered. In practice, the 
porous medium is dried by a hot dry (or moist) air flow. Under this circumstance, an external dry 
air flow is imposed on the surface o f the porous medium. Generally speaking, the external flow 
should increase the mass transfer coefBcient at the interface between the external flow and the 
porous medium. However, as have been mentioned before in chapter 2, the drying behavior at the 
interface between the external flow and the porous medium is still unclear. It is interesting, 
therefore, to  study the influence of the external flow on the mass transfer at the interface.

Fig. 5-37 Solution domain and the geometrical size

The solution domain to be used in the numerical calculation is presented in Fig. 5-37. The 
geometrical size of the domain is as shown in the figure. The network used to represent the 
porous medium is the same of section 5.2 and 5.3 (100x20). To facilitate the coupling of the 
external flow with the porous medium, an uniform 100x20 grid is used for the external flow 
domain. Thus, each throat is coupled with one control volume at the interface. Both network and 
external flow grids have an unity thickness. It is not necessary, therefore, to convert the throat 
surface at the interface. It should be pointed out that the main focus here is not on the numerical 
accuracy o f  the phenomenon that is being modeled. Instead a general description of the drying 
kinetics is being sought. For a more representative simulation in which quantitative agreement 
with experiments is needed a more refined grid is required.

The simulation conditions for porous medium are the same of the last section. The inlet 
velocity o f the external flow is assumed to be uniform and the inlet mass fi'action of alcohol vapor 
is zero. The velocity field is obtained by solving the differential equations (2-1) and (2-2) under 
the assumption o f no-slip condition at the interface. Considering that the evaporation rate at the 
interface is not very high, the obtained velocity field is used for the whole simulation without



C h apter 5 R esu lts an d Discussions 88

updating it, that is, the quantity o f the evaporated alcohol vapor from the porous medium is 
assumed to be small enough to not influence the velocity field. This can save the computation time 
significantly and, as explored by Prata and Sparrow (1987) in a somehow similar problem, has a 
negUgible effect on both the flow field and the evaporation rate. After the velocity field is 
calculated, the moisture field is obtained by solving the differential equation (2-3) with the 
prescribed evaporation rate at the interface. The moisture field is updated for each drying time 
interval with the updated evaporation rate at the interface. The procedure of the alcohol removal 
from the network is the same of that described in last section. The drying simulation is made on 
network 1 for the inlet velocity of 1 ~ 50 m/s, and for the aforegiven parameters the flow is 
laminar.

5.4.1 Drying Kinetics

The drying kinetics curves for inlet velocity of 1 ~ 50 m/s is presented in Fig. 5-38. One 
can see that the difference of drying time caused by the external flow is small. The difference of 
the total drying time is not larger than 10%. Just as have been observed in the results of the phase 
distribution, the drying curves begin to deviate one from the other at the very begirming o f drying 
until S=0.60. The maximum difference o f drying time can reach 50% (between U=1.0 and 50.0 
m/s). After the saturation of S=0.60, the deviation stops developing and the drying time curves 
for the various inlet velocities become almost the same.

It is surprising to observe that the relationship between the drying time and the inlet 
velocity is not monotonie. The network dries fastest when the inlet velocity is U=10.0 m/s and the 
total drying time for U=5 .0 m/s is larger than that for U=3 .0 m/s. This is, of course, unexpected 
from the point of view of the continuum approach. One can note that the drying curves become 
nearly parallel while the saturation equals to about 0.60. To have a better look at the beginning of 
the drying process. Figs. 5-39 ,40 and 41 were prepared.

It is observed from Figs. 5-39 to 41 that for S &gt; 0.7, the drying time decreases as the inlet 
velocity increases, as expected. This evidences the external flow influence on the drying kinetics 
during this period. Also noted from the figures is that the influence of external flow decreases 
with increasing inlet velocity. That is, the impact on drying of an increase of the inlet velocity 
diminishes as the inlet velocity increases. One can see that near the S=0.65, drying is accelerated 
for U=7.0 and 10.0 m/s and the corresponding curves for these inlet velocities cross the curve for 
U=50.0 m/s. In especial, the curve for U=7.0 m/s crosses the curve for U=50.0 m/s four times. It 
becomes to dry more quickly than U=50.0 m/s near S=0.65 and back to dry more slowly near 
S=0.50. It becomes to dry faster again at S=0.25 and to dry slower near S=0.20. Also worth



C h a p te r s  R esu lts a n d  D iscussions 89

noting is that close to S=0.25 the curve for 5.0 m/s that was yielding drying times smaller than 
those of U=3.0 m/s crosses it and starts to dry more slowly. Those findings will be discussed with 
the results for the evaporating area.

5.4.2 Drying Rate

The drying rate curves shown in Fig. 5-42 is, as also presented in the last section, the 
drying time derivative of saturation (dS/dt) versus saturation. It can been found that the difference 
o f drying rate caused by the external flow velocity occurs before saturation reaches the 0.60 
value. The maximum difference on the drying rate takes place at the initial of drying. This 
difference decreases with the reducing saturation. A second drop in the drying rate can been 
observed for all inlet velocities investigated. From Fig. 5-43, one can find that the second fall in 
drying rate occurs between S=0.70 and 0.60. As have been discussed in the last section, this point 
indicates the moment that the top surface becomes totally dry. The second drop takes place at 
smaller saturation for U=10.0 m/s than for the others velocities. This coincides with the drying 
kinetics where the network dries most quickly for U=10.0 m/s than for the others velocities. After 
the second fall, the drying rate for all cases tend to be the same. This indicates that the external 
flow has influence on the drying kinetics only when the top surface is totally or partially wetted. 
For a dry surface the mtemal vapor diffusion resistance overcomes the external convective 
resistance, and becomes the dominant mechanism for drying.

5.4.3 Evaporating Area in Network

The evaporating area inside the network, from which the information of evaporating front 
can be obtained, is plotted in Fig. 5-44. It is found that the evaporating area for all inlet velocities 
investigated has the same overall pattern. The evaporating area at the very beginning is the same 
for all inlet velocities since this area is exactly the wet area when the top surface is saturated. As 
the same network is used for all velocities, the wet area of top surface is the same. The 
evaporating area increase with the decreasing saturation until the first peak is reached. It can be 
also seen that the peak value and the corresponding saturation peak value is different for various 
inlet velocities. The evaporating area decreases after this point since all the evaporating front 
begin to recede from the top surface, as a result, the evaporating front becomes flatter. The first 
peak point corresponds to the moment that the top surface becomes totally dry. The second peak 
of evaporating area is believed to be caused by the formation of more trapped clusters in the 
network. The evaporating area during the simulation for each inlet velocity is different. This 
suggests an influence of the inlet velocity on the phase distribution in the network. Attention will 
be returned to this matter in section 5.4.6.

A carefiil examination of Fig. 5-44 indicates that the curve for U=7.0 m/s crosses the 
curve for U=50.0 m/s four times, just as have been observed in Fig. 5-38. The first peak for 
U=7.0 m/s occurs later and is higher than U=50.0 m/s, corresponding to the first cross in which 
U=7.0 m/s becomes to dry more quickly than U=50.0 m/s. The second peak takes place on the 
curve for U=50.0 m/s during S=0.60 ~ 0.40 resulting in a faster drying while no peak is observed 
on the curve for U=7.0 m/s. The evaporating area for U=7.0 m/s becomes higher than that for 
U=50.0 m/s near S=0.40 and lower agaui near S=0.20, corresponding to the other two cross of 
the drying curves, as mentioned before. It is worth noting that although the evaporating area for 
U=7.0 m/s is not much higher than that for U=50.0 m/s, considering the large inlet velocity 
difference, the case for U=7.0 m/s succeeds in drying faster than U=50.0 m/s during S=0.40 ~ 
0.20, indicating that the external flow influence is weak during the latter drying period.

The variation of the wet area percentage of the top surface with the saturation is presented 
in Fig. 5-45 to show the moment that the top surface becomes totally dried. It can be seen that the 
variation o f wet area percentage of the top surface with the saturation is almost the same for all 
inlet velocities. The top surface dries quickly at the very beginning and only 5 .0% o f top surface is 
wetted when S=0.90. The top surface approximately maintains this percentage of wet area until 
S=0.65. Recalling what have been observed on the drying rate curves, the drying rate decreases 
sharply before S &gt; 0.90 and then becomes almost constant until the second drop. To show more 
clearly how the wet area percentage at the top surface approaches zero. Fig. 5-46 was prepared. 
It should be noted that the curve for U=50.0 m/s is overlapped on the curve of U=1.0 m/s. It can



C h a p te r s  R esults an d  D iscussions 92

be seen that the sequence that the top surface becomes totally dry coincides with the sequence of 
second drop in drying rate in Fig. 5-43 and the first peak point of evaporating area in Fig. 5-44.

5.4.4 Local Evaporation Rate at the Top Surface

As have been pointed out in the last section, the drying rate curves presented in Figs. 5-42 
and 43 give the average value of the mass fluxes at the top surface, and one cannot have an idea 
o f the local mass fluxes from those figures. The local mass fluxes at the top surface during the 
drying process are important in studying the influence of dry patches on the drying kinetics, and in 
exploring the influence of the surface saturation on the mass transfer coeflBcient. In applying the 
continuum approach to predict drying of unsaturated porous medium much debate has appeared 
in the literature concerning the variation of the local Sherwood number on the top surface and the 
validity of the analogy between heat and mass transfer (see for example, Lee et al., 1992, Rogers 
and Kaviany, 1990, Tao and Kaviany, 1989 and Chen and Pei, 1989). To shed some Ught into this 
issue, the local mass fluxes at the top surface for some cases at certain saturations are presented in 
Fig. 5-47 ~ 49. The inlet velocity of the external flow is 1, 5 and 10 m/s, respectively.

From these figures, one can see the influence of the external flow on the mass fluxes along 
the top surface. The local mass fluxes profiles are different from those presented in Fig. 5-9 and 
10, where the mass fraction of alcohol vapor at the top surface was taken to be zero, and as a 
result, the local mass fluxes of the wetted interface was uniform. With an external flow over the 
surface of the porous medium, the local mass fluxes of the wetted top surface decrease 
downstream. This mass fluxes profile is expected and follows the typical mass transfer pattern 
observed from a boundary layer over a flat surface (Kays and Crawford, 1993). The mass fraction 
o f alcohol vapor at the entrance of the external flow domain is zero, and the evaporation rate at 
the wetted surface is highest. The evaporated alcohol vapor is carried downstream in the domain 
resulting in an alcohol laden air along the top surface, decreasing the evaporating rate. As can 
been observed from the figures the boundary layer effect has virtually no influence on the 
evaporation flux when the top surface is no longer wet. Once again, the difference of mass fluxes 
for wetted and dry top surface is very large.

After the top surface have been dried, the external flow has a weak influence on the mass 
fluxes profile. Contrary to the wetted surface, the local mass fluxes downstream can be higher 
than that upstream. This is so because for a dry top surface the mass flux is more affected by the 
resistance to vapor diffusion inside the network, as explored before.

A careflil examination of the phase distribution maps and the corresponding local mass 
fluxes at the top surface indicate the influence of the external flow, in spite of its weakness, after 
the top surface have been dried. From Fig. 5-43, one can find that, at the latter periods of drying, 
the mass flux upstream can be higher than that downstream, considering the large distance 
between the evaporating front and the top surface.

Chapter 5 Results and Discussions 97

Other interesting finding extracted fi-om Fig, 5-47 ~ 49 is that the mass fluxes profiles at 
the top surface for latter drying periods (S &amp;lt;0.30) are ahnost the same for the three different inlet 
velocities, even though the evaporating fi-onts in the network have different shapes. As have been 
discussed before, the evaporating front in the network during the drying process is far from being 
flat. This heterogeneity in the evaporating front has a strong influence on the mass fluxes at the 
top surface while the top surface is totally or partially wet. This influence reduces with the 
receding evaporating front from top surface. From what are observed here, it seems that the 
heterogeneity of evaporating front is no longer important for latter drying periods. Recalling that 
the present network has only a depth of 1.2 cm, this finding suggests that from the point of view 
of the validity o f the continuum approach, the stability o f evaporating front is not so important as 
one might think, once the top surface has been totally dried.

At high saturation, comparing the mass fluxes profiles at the top surface for different inlet 
velocities, one can find that the difference in the mass fluxes caused by the external flow decrease 
with increasing inlet velocity, as explored in Fig. 5-50, Again this is an expected result and follows 
from the boundary layer theory.

5.4.5 Local Mass Transfer Coefficient at Top Surface

As have been discussed by Lee et al. (1992), the convective mass transfer coefBcient 
calculated from the analogy between heat and mass transfer holds only if the top surface is 
completely covered with liquid resulting in the saturated vapor conditions at all points on the 
surface. If the surface is partially wet, then the average vapor pressure at the surface should be 
less than the saturated value. Thus, it is interesting to e?q)lore the near surface physics using the 
present drying model. For this purpose, the local convective mass transfer coefficient at the 
surface for S«1.0 are presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 for inlet velocities of 1.0 ~ 10.0 m/s and 
compared with the convective mass transfer coeflBcient calculated from the correlation of 
boundary layer theory.

In each figure six set o f results are presented. The solid line is obtained from the boundary 
layer theory; large slashed line represents the numerical results assuming that the top surface is 
totally covered with liquid; triangles are numerical resuhs for actual situation as seen in Figs. 3-7 
to 3-9, that is, part o f the top surface is wetted and part is solid; slash-dotted line is curve fitting 
for the triangles; circles are numerical results for actual situation averaged over the surface of 
each control volume; small slashed line is curve fitting for the circles. More details about each one 
of the set of results will be provided in the next paragraphs.

The mass transfer coeflBcient in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 is defined as

Pvs-P«

where k is the convective mass transfer coeflBcient, is the vapor flux density, pyg is the 
saturated vapor density and p„ is the inlet vapor density.

To show the validity o f the present numerical results, the local mass transfer coeflBcient 
calculated using the 100x20 uniform grid with assumption o f the saturated vapor density at all 
points on the top surface (total wet surface) are also presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 and compared 
with that calculated from the correlation of boundary layer theory. According to boundary layer 
theory, the local mass transfer coeflBcient for laminar flow can be calculated using the following 
correlation

Sh, = 0 .3 3 2 R ef Sc*'' for S O l (5-1)



Chapter 5 Results an d  D iscussions gg

where Sh?  is the local Sherwood number, (kx/D), Re^ is the local Reynolds number, (pU„x/|a), 
and Sc is the Schmit number, (v/D).

It can be found from these figures that the deviation between numerical and analytical 
results concentrates near the upstream and increases with the inlet velocity. This is so because, as 
have been mentioned at the begmning of this section, the grid used for external flow is not refined 
enough for describing the vapor density derivative near the inlet edge where the boundary layer is 
very thin. With a higher inlet velocity, the boundary layer near the inlet edge is thinner resulting in 
a larger deviation between the numerical and analytical results. However, the numerical results are 
reasonable for a qualitative analysis.

It can be also seen that the local mass transfer coefficients calculated numerically for the 
actual situation (S=1.0) under all investigated inlet velocities are higher than that calculated from 
the boundary layer theory. It is an expected result since the top surface o f network is not totally 
covered by liquid even when the saturation at the top surface is equal to 1.0 The wet surface is 
about 30% of the total surfece at S=1.0. Clearly, the saturation conditions can be only used on 
wet surface and at the solid surface the vapor pressure is practically zero. Comparing with the 
totally wet surface, less vapor enter into the external flow resulting in a lower mass fraction in the 
boundary layer and, consequently, a higher local convective mass transfer coefficient. The local 
mass transfer coefficient presented in Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 for the actual situation is the local value for 
wet surface. In other words, the area for mass transfer considered here is not the total top surface, 
but the sectional area o f throats on the top surface. Recalling the Fig. 3-9 that shows the coupling 
of the porous medium with the external flow, the local mass transfer coefficient for wet surface is 
obtained using the mass flux density at the wet surface, not the average value for the total surface.

The local mass transfer coefficient calculated from average mass flux density for actual 
situation shows a very interesting behavior. One can note from Fig. 5-51 ~ 55 that these local 
mass transfer coefficients agree well with the correlation value for all investigated inlet velocities. 
Again, the deviation occurs only near the inlet edge and increases with increasing inlet velocity. It 
seems that the local mass transfer coefficient obtained from analogy can be used at the very 
beginning of the drying even though the top surface o f porous medium is not totally covered with 
liquid. It should be pointed out that the wet surface is somehow distributed periodically on the top 
surface of network and is in accord with the point o f view of the continuum approach. As the 
evaporating front receding from top surface, of course, the wet patches are no longer distributed 
periodically on top surface and, as have been shown in Fig. 5-47 ~ 49, the local mass transfer 
coefficient will be quite different from that obtained using the correlation.

Fig. 5-56 Calculated vapor density 
as a function of surface saturation

The variation of the vapor density at the top surface with the surface saturation for various 
inlet velocities is presented in Fig. 5-56. The vapor density is back calculated using the convective 
mass transfer coefiBcient obtained under the saturated conditions at the top surface. One can find 
that the vapor density at the top surface is less than the saturated value for all surface saturation. 
This is in accord with the observation of Lee et al. (1992) in their experiment results. Also noting 
is that the vapor density for the same surface saturation decreases with an increasing inlet 
velocity.

5.4.6 Moisture Field and Boundary Layer

The boundary layer for the alcohol vapor mass fi-action during the drying simulation are 
presented in Fig. 5-57 ~ 59 for some cases. The numbers in the figures are not the mass fraction 
but the relative humidity value of the alcohol vapor (P/Pq) due to the small values of the mass 
fraction. The size of external domain is 60 x 3 mm, and in the figures presented here the y- 
direction is amplified to show the boundary layer more clearly.

From Fig. 5-57, one can see that the boundary layer thickness decreases as drying 
proceeds. The mass fraction near the top surface decreases rapidly with the receding evaporating 
front during the early drying period. After the interface is totally dried, the mass fraction near the



C h a p te r s  R esults an d  D iscussions 102

top surface reduce to a very low value, and the boundary layer thickness remains almost 
unchanged.

Some evaporation focuses are observed when the top surface is partially wetted at the 
early drying period. As have been discussed before, the mass flux is very affected whether the top 
surface is dry or wet. This difference can be of the order of ten times. The evaporated alcohol 
vapor goes into the external flow mainly from the wet patches. When the external flow velocity is 
not very high, the alcohol vapor evaporated from the wet patches is not carried away by 
convection quickly enough, and the mass fraction near these wet patches become higher than that 
of the adjacent regions, yielding a mass fraction gradient along the top surface that can be in the 
downstream or upstream direction, depending on the mass fluxes and on the velocity of external 
flow.

Comparing Figs. 5-57, 58 and 59, one can see that the thickness of the boundary layer 
decreases with increasing inlet velocities due to the stronger convection. The boundary layer 
thickness for U=5.0 m/s, for example, is just a half of that for U=1.0 m/s. The thickness of the 
boundary layer for U=10.0 m/s, however, is only a little smaller than that for U=5.0 m/s. The 
same behavior is observed for the mass fraction near the top surface, which is reduced from about 
0.481 to 0.301 while the inlet velocity increases from 1.0 to 5.0 m/s. The top surface mass 
fraction only decreases from 0.301 to 0.251 as the external flow velocity increases from 5.0 to 
10.0 m/s, indicating that the external flow influence decrease with increasing inlet velocity.

It can be also noted that the evaporation focuses observed at low inlet velocity is no 
longer so obvious when the inlet velocity is relatively high. This is so because the alcohol vapor 
evaporated from the wet patches (focuses for low inlet velocity case) can be carried downstream 
by convective for the higher inlet velocities, and the vapor evaporated from wet patches, 
therefore, can not be accumulated to form the focuses of alcohol vapor.

The boundary layers for case of U=1.0 m/s are drawn in Fig. 5-60 in color to show more 
clearly the evaporation focuses at the top surface. One can see that there are some high alcohol 
vapor concentration regions at the top surface (red areas) while the surface is partially wetted. 
These focuses o f alcohol vapor are coincident with the wetted surface where the evaporation 
fluxes are very high. After the top surface is totally dried, no focus is observed at the interface.

It should be noted that different scales for the mass fraction were employed for the various 
saturation in drawing Fig. 5-60. The same color indicates different mass fraction value in different 
drying stages. One can refer to Fig. 5-57 to have an idea about the mass fraction value during the 
drying process.

Chapter 6 Conclusions 107

Ch a p t e r  6  C o n c l u s i o n s

A microscopic drying model for capillary porous medium is presented in this thesis. This 
microscopic model is based on a network approach for porous medium and is intended to study 
the mass transfer behaviors inside the porous medium at the pore level during the drying process. 
It can be used, for example, to study the efifect of heterogeneities of phase distribution in porous 
medium, that cannot be attained by a macroscopic drying model due to the continuum approach. 
Moreover, the Kelvin effect can be studied in a quantitative manner. The influence o f dry patches 
at the interface on the local mass fluxes can be shown clearly in the present simulation since the 
microscopic model is able to describe the phase distribution at the top surface.

The phase distribution effect, the Kelvin effect and the influence of inlet velocity o f the 
external flow upon the drying process are studied in the present thesis using this microscopic 
model. From the simulations the following conclusions can be extracted.

• Three distinguished regions are observed in simulation, i.e., dry region, unsaturated region 
and saturated region. The evaporating fi-ont region (unsaturated region) is relatively stable, 
although it is far from being a flat surface. Many temporary liquid clusters appear in the 
unsaturated region as drying proceeds and the cluster number increases with increasing 
distance of the evaporating front from the top surface. In other words, the depth of the 
evaporating front region increases during the drying process. This observation indicates 
that the two-zone model used to describe the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during 
the falling rate period is more realistic than the single zone model.

• Phase distribution (moisture heterogeneities) has a great influence on the drying rate 
through the formation of the funicular dry zone, specially at the beginning o f the drying 
process. This influence decreases with the receding of the evaporating front from the top



Chapter 6 Conclusions 108

surface. The drying process becomes vapor diffusion dominated after the interface is 
totally dried and the influence of phase distribution heterogeneities decrease.

Evaporation-condensation inside the porous medium is observed in the present 
simulations. Some clusters are condensing at one drying time interval and can not be 
eliminated by evaporation action. These condensing clusters always appear surrounded by 
other evaporating clusters. They can become evaporating clusters and thus be eliminated 
as drying proceeds.

Concerning to the microscopic model, the Kelvin effect makes a very small difference in 
terms o f the difilision driving force caused by the meniscus curvature. The Kelvin effect, 
however, is very important from the point of view of the evaporation-condensation 
mechanism. The appearance of condensing clusters changes the drying path due to the 
liquid removing process. Consequently, the phase distribution is altered during the drying 
process. This influence is not the same for different network.

Dry patches phenomena (surface saturation) have a strong influence on the local mass 
fluxes at the interface. The difference of mass fluxes for wet and dry surface can reach to 
ten times.

Constant rate period is not observed for the simulations performed in the present work 
because that only 30% of top surface is covered with liquid even as top surface saturation 
equals to 1.0. A second drop in the drying rate is found, which indicates the moment that 
the top surface becomes totally dried.

Numerical local mass transfer coefficient for the totally wetted top surface agree with the 
analytical value. The local mass transfer coefficient calculated from average mass flux 
density for actual situation shows a very interesting behavior. The local mass transfer 
coefficient agree well Avith the correlation value for all investigated mlet velocities even 
though the top surface is not totally covered with liquid, but periodically distributed.

Inlet velocity of the external flow over the top surface o f the porous medium affects the 
local mass fluxes. This is significant only while the interface is totally or partially wet. The 
influence o f the inlet velocity decreases with the receding evaporating front. Concerning 
the stability o f the evaporating front, it seems that this is only important at the begiiming of 
drying.



C hapter 6 Conclusions 109

It should be pointed out that the network size used in the present work (100x20) is not 
large enough to assure statistical homogeneity. As can be seen in chapter 5, different networks 
which are constructed with the same size distribution of pores and throats, but with a different 
random generator, do not show the same drying kinetics. In fact, the random generator will settle 
the spatial distribution of clusters of small diameter throats: when these clusters are located near 
the top surface, the efifect is to increase the drying rate, as a consequence of smaller vapor 
difRision resistance. The networks considered in the present work are, nevertheless, important for 
describing the efifect of heterogeneities in the spatial distribution of pores on drying kinetics, 
specially at the very beginning of drying. In fact, spatial heterogeneities are frequently found in 
samples used for drying as a resuh of sample manufacturing. These heterogeneities have a great 
influence on the early stage of drying, when the drying depth is of same magnitude order as the 
mean heterogeneity length.

It is worthy reminding that the microscopic drying model presented here is, in some 
meanings, a simplified model. Naturally, there are many improvements that should be done for the 
model. The mechanism for liquid transfer considered here, for instance, is only the capillary force. 
The formation of liquid films on the porous surface at unsaturated regions, as have been observed 
by Prat in his experiments (1993), is not taken into account and may modify the drying kinetics. 
The gravity efifect, which can play a role either as stablisant or déstabilisant of evaporating front, 
is ignored. The model can not address all drying situations and heat transfer is not taken into 
account in the present model. To describe the porous medium better, the model should be 
extended to three dimensions.
