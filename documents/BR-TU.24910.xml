Pessan JP. Incorporação de flúor no biofilme dentário e fluido do biofilme após o uso de 
dentifrícios convencional e com concentração reduzida de flúor, em comunidades com 
diferentes níveis de flúor na água de abastecimento [tese]. Araçatuba: Universidade Estadual 
Paulista; 2009.

RESUMO 

Avaliou-se a incorporação de flúor (F) no biofilme dentário e fluido do biofilme após o uso de 
dentifrícios convencional(DC) e com concentração reduzida de F(DCR). A hipótese do estudo foi de 
que o uso do DCR levaria a uma incorporação proporcionalmente mais alta no biofilme, 
principalmente nas camadas mais profundas do mesmo, e que estes aumentos seriam refletidos no 
fluido do biofilme. Na primeira etapa, foram comparadas as concentrações de F e cálcio (Ca) presentes 
no biofilme após o uso de dentifrícios contendo 0 (dentifrício placebo–DP), 513(DCR) e 1.072(DC) 
ppm F, em crianças residentes em comunidades contendo 0,04(A), 0,72(B) e 3,36(C) ppm F na água 
de abastecimento.  Seguindo um protocolo duplo-cego e cruzado, as crianças escovaram seus dentes 2 
vezes ao dia, durante 7 dias. Amostras de biofilme foram coletadas 1 e 12 horas após a última 
escovação. Na segunda e terceira etapas, conduzidas somente na comunidade B, avaliou-se a 
incorporação de F em secções seriais de biofilme formado utilizando “dispositivos in situ de Leeds”, 
bem como a concentração de F no fluido do biofilme, respectivamente, empregando o protocolo 
descrito anteriormente. As análises de F foram realizadas após extração ácida (biofilme total), por 
cromatografia iônica (secções de biofilme) e após tamponamento com TISAB III (fluido do biofilme). 
As análises de Ca foram realizadas por espectrometria de absorção atômica (primeira e segunda 
etapas) e por método colorimétrico (terceira etapa). Os dados foram analisados por ANOVA, testes de 
Tukey e Bonferroni e Análise de Regressão Linear (p&lt;0,05). Na primeira etapa, as concentrações de F 
estavam diretamente relacionadas às concentrações de F na água de abastecimento, 
independentemente do dentifrício utilizado. O uso dos dentifrícios fluoretados levou a aumentos 
significativos nas concentrações de F no biofilme 1h após o uso dos mesmos nas comunidades A e B 
apenas. Aumentos virtualmente idênticos foram observados 1h após a escovação com o DCR (ca.1,9 
mmolF/kg) e DC (ca.2,4 mmolF/kg) nas comunidades A e B quando comparados ao DP; estes 
aumentos foram menos pronunciados na comunidade C. Para a segunda etapa, observou-se que o F se 
restringiu principalmente às camadas mais externas do biofilme para todos os dentifrícios, tendo sido 
observado um padrão semelhante para o Ca. Os valores obtidos para DC foram significativamente 
maiores que os obtidos para o DP. As concentrações de F e Ca estiveram positiva e significativamente 
relacionadas na maioria das secções do biofilme. Quanto à terceira etapa, as concentrações de F no 
biofilme total apresentaram um padrão semelhante ao observado para a primeira etapa; no entanto, 
estas não foram refletidas no fluido do biofilme. Houve uma correlação positiva e significativa entre as 
concentrações de flúor e cálcio no biofilme total para a maioria das situações analisadas. Os resultados 
confirmam a hipótese de que o uso do DCR leva a uma incorporação de F no biofilme 
proporcionalmente mais alta em comparação ao DC e também corroboram achados prévios sugerindo 
que a retenção de F no biofilme é dependente das concentrações de Ca no mesmo. Entretanto, a 
incorporação de F promovida pelo DCR não ocorre em camadas mais profundas em comparação ao 
DC.

and low-fluoride dentifrices in communities with different fluoride levels in the drinking 
water [thesis]. Araçatuba: São Paulo State University; 2009.

ABSTRACT 

This study evaluated fluoride (F) uptake by dental biofilm and biofilm fluid after the use of 
conventional (CD) and low-fluoride (LFD) dentifrices. The hypothesis of the study was that the use of 
LDF would lead to a proportionally higher F uptake by the biofilm, mainly in the deepest layers of it, 
and that such increases would be reflected in the biofilm fluid. In the first phase, F and calcium (Ca) 
concentrations in the biofilm were compared after the use of dentifrices containing 0 (placebo 
dentifrice–PD), 513 and 1,072 ppm F, in children living in communities containing 0.04(A), 0.72(B) 
and 3.36(C) ppm F in the drinking water. Following a double-blind, crossover protocol, children 
brushed their teeth twice daily, during seven days. Samples of biofilm were collected on the seventh 
day, 1 and 12 h after the last use of the dentifrices. In the second and third phases, which were 
conducted only in the community B, we evaluated F uptake in serial sections of biofilms formed using 
the “Leeds in situ devices”, as well as in the biofilm fluid, respectively, following the same protocol 
described for the first phase. F analyses were carried out after acid extraction (whole biofilm), by ion 
chromatography (sections of biofilm) and after buffering with TISAB III (biofilm fluid). Analyses of 
Ca were done by atomic absorption spectrometry (first and second phases) and colorimetrically (third 
phase). Results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey’s and Bonferroni’s tests, by linear regression 
analysis and by Pearson’s correlation (p&lt;0.05). For the first phase, mean biofilm F concentrations 
were directly related to F concentrations in water, regardless of the dentifrice used. The use of the 
fluoridated dentifrices led to significant increases in F concentrations in the biofilm 1 h after their use, 
in the communities A and B only. Virtually identical increases were observed 1 h after brushing with 
CD (ca.1.9 mmolF/kg) and LFD (ca.2.4 mmolF/kg) in the communities A and B when compared to 
PD. These increases were less pronounced in the community C. For the second phase, it was observed 
that F was mostly restricted to the outer layers of biofilm for all the dentifrices tested, and a similar 
pattern was observed for Ca. The values obtained for CD were significantly higher than those 
observed for PD. F and Ca concentrations were positively and significantly correlated throughout most 
of biofilms’ sections. For the third phase, F concentrations in whole biofilm showed a similar pattern 
to that observed for the first phase; however, F levels were not reflected in the biofilm fluid. Positive 
and significant correlations were verified among F and Ca concentrations in whole biofilm for most of 
the situations evaluated. The results confirm the hypothesis that the use of the LFD leads to a 
proportionally higher F uptake by the biofilm when compared to CD and also corroborate previous 
findings showing that F uptake by the biofilm is dependent on Ca concentrations. However, unlike our 
prediction, the use of LFD did not promote a higher F uptake in deeper layers of the biofilms when 
compared to CD.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 

A manutenção dos níveis intrabucais de flúor exerce um papel fundamental na 

dinâmica da cárie dentária, uma vez que uma relação inversa entre as concentrações de flúor 

no biofilme dentário e na saliva e a prevalência e atividade de cárie tem sido demonstrada por 

vários estudos clínicos (Gaugler, Bruton, 19821; Shields et al., 19872; Nobre dos Santos et al., 

20023). Em diversos países ocidentais, as formas mais amplamente difundidas do uso dos 

fluoretos são a água, com concentrações usualmente em torno de 1 µg F/mL, e dentifrícios, 

tipicamente contendo 1.000-1.500 µg F/g. 

Apesar da grande diferença entre as concentrações de flúor dos dois métodos, estudos 

epidemiológicos têm demonstrado um maior efeito da água fluoretada no controle da cárie 

dentária em comparação aos dentifrícios fluoretados (O´Mullane, 19904, Mellberg, 19905, 

Marinho et al., 20036). Embora diferenças quanto à frequência de exposição entre os dois 

métodos possam explicar em parte os resultados obtidos por estudos epidemiológicos, ainda 

não está claro o motivo pelo qual o consumo regular de água fluoretada resulta numa maior 

redução da cárie dentária quando comparado ao uso de dentifrícios fluoretados. Com base na 

premissa de que os processos de desmineralização do esmalte somente irão ocorrer na 

presença de biofilme dentário e considerando-se uma relação dose-resposta, seria esperado 

que o uso regular de dentifrícios fluoretados produzisse concentrações mais altas de flúor no 

biofilme dentário, o que, teoricamente, produziria um maior efeito cariostático durante os 

episódios de queda do pH do biofilme. 

Esta questão foi levantada previamente, em estudos que demonstraram uma relação 

direta entre as concentrações de cálcio e flúor no biofilme dentário em comunidades com água

de abastecimento fluoretada (Whitford et al., 2002)7 e não fluoretada (Whitford et al., 2005)8. 

Em adição, verificou-se que as concentrações de flúor obtidas 12 horas após o uso de um 

dentifrício fluoretado permaneciam significativamente aumentadas em relação ao uso de um 

dentifrício placebo na comunidade não fluoretada, o que não ocorreu na comunidade 

fluoretada. Os autores sugeriram um limite na incorporação de flúor no biofilme dentário, o 

que seria determinado pelo número de sítios de cálcio disponíveis para ligação do flúor 

(Whitford et al., 2002, 2005). 

Uma vez que as diferenças entre as populações envolvidas nos estudos previamente 

mencionados (adultos norte-americanos residentes em uma área fluoretada e adolescentes 

brasileiros de uma área não fluoretada) não permitia uma comparação direta entre os 

resultados, Pessan et al. (2008)9 conduziram um estudo com o mesmo protocolo utilizado por 

Whitford et al. (2002, 2005), mas com crianças brasileiras com mesma faixa etária, residentes 

em áreas com concentrações de flúor na água de abastecimento de 0,04, 0,85 e 3,5 ppm de 

flúor. Um dos principais achados do estudo de Pessan et al. (2008) foi que o dentifrício 

fluoretado produziu um aumento virtualmente idêntico nas concentrações de flúor no biofilme 

dentário 1 hora após seu uso (em torno de 6,5 mmol F/Kg, peso seco), para as 3 comunidades 

envolvidas, independentemente do que já havia sido incorporado devido ao consumo da água.  

As razões deste fenômeno, também verificado em um estudo conduzido em indivíduos 

de faixa etária e nível socioeconômico semelhantes (Whitford et al., 2005), ainda não estão 

claras. Considerando-se que a concentração de flúor no dentifrício é muito mais alta que a 

encontrada na água de abastecimento, era esperado que o uso de um dentifrício fluoretado 

pudesse igualar ou nivelar a quantidade de flúor retida no biofilme 1 hora após a escovação, 

independentemente da quantidade de flúor previamente retida no biofilme relacionada à 

exposição à água fluoretada, o que não ocorreu. A análise destes dados conjuntamente levou 

os investigadores a hipotetizar que o flúor em sua forma iônica (como presente na água) 

poderia penetrar mais profundamente no biofilme dentário quando comparado a uma fonte de 

flúor mais concentrada (como os dentifrícios), considerando-se que o uso destes produtos 

levaria a uma formação de compostos de CaF2 ou CaF+ na saliva, os quais migrariam

predominantemente para a superfície do biofilme dentário (Whitford et al., 2005, Pessan et 

al., 2008). 

Para que o mecanismo proposto possa ser validado, seria interessante conduzir um 

estudo com o mesmo protocolo utilizado por Pessan et al. (2008), incluindo uma nova etapa, 

na qual um dentifrício com concentração reduzida de flúor (500-550 ppm) fosse utilizado. 

Visto que com o uso de um dentifrício contendo 1.100 ppm de flúor promoveu uma 

incorporação de flúor no biofilme constante para os voluntários das três comunidades 

estudadas, independentemente do nível basal de flúor presente, seria esperado que a utilização 

de um dentifrício com a metade da concentração de flúor promovesse uma incorporação 

também constante para as 3 comunidades, embora em menor magnitude. 

Em acréscimo, a avaliação da concentração de flúor em secções seriais do biofilme 

dentário (Robinson et al., 199710, Kato et al., 199711, Watson et al., 200512) após o uso dos 

dentifrícios previamente mencionados ainda não foi realizada e seria de extrema importância 

na elucidação dos eventos ocorridos na incorporação de flúor no biofilme dentário. É possível 

que o dentifrício de baixa concentração de flúor permita uma incorporação de flúor em 

regiões mais profundas do biofilme, já que uma menor concentração de flúor na saliva 

reduziria a formação e precipitação de compostos de cálcio e flúor na superfície do biofilme. 

Uma vez que o uso destes dentifrícios ainda é controverso com relação à redução na 

prevalência da cárie dentária (Ammari et al., 2003)13, o presente estudo poderia trazer 

informações adicionais que viessem a contribuir na tentativa de se estabelecer a real 

participação dos mesmos no controle da cárie.  

Finalmente, a avaliação das concentrações de flúor e cálcio no fluido do biofilme 

poderia trazer informações úteis sobre a disponibilidade dos mesmos no interior do biofilme 

e, consequentemente, o papel destes íons na dinâmica da desmineralização e remineralização 

do esmalte dentário após o uso de dentifrícios convencional e com concentração reduzida de

flúor. Visto que o fluido do biofilme é a fração que tem contato direto com a superfície do 

esmalte, fica evidente que o estudo de sua composição inorgânica se reveste de grande 

relevância do ponto de vista clínico, já que a concentração de flúor e cálcio no mesmo 

determina a saturação do mineral dentário na cavidade bucal (Margolis e Moreno, 199214; 

Vogel et al., 199015). Desta forma, considerando-se que a maioria dos indivíduos não remove 

completamente o biofilme após a escovação e que a desmineralização do esmalte somente irá 

ocorrer na presença de biofilme, a quantidade de flúor retida neste pode exercer um papel 

importante no controle da cárie dentária. Desta maneira, o entendimento do mecanismo de 

incorporação do flúor no biofilme é fundamental para a elaboração de estratégias visando ao 

aumento da sua incorporação.  

Diante do exposto, o presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a incorporação de flúor 

no biofilme dentário e fluido do biofilme após o uso de dentifrícios convencional e com 

concentração reduzida de F, em comunidades com 0,04, 0,72 e 3,36 ppm de F na água de 

abastecimento.

ABSTRACT 

Previous studies indicate that the use of low-fluoride dentifrices (LF) could lead to 

proportionally higher plaque fluoride levels when compared to conventional dentifrices (C). 

This double-blind, randomized, crossover study determined the effects of placebo dentifrice, 

LF and C on plaque fluoride concentrations ([F]) in children living in communities with 0.04, 

0.72 and 3.36 ppmF in the drinking water. Children used the toothpastes twice daily, for 1 

week. Samples were collected 1 and 12h after the last use of dentifrices and were analyzed for 

fluoride and calcium. Results were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and linear regression 

analysis. Similar increases were found 1h after brushing with LF (ca.1.9 mmolF/kg) and C 

(ca.2.4 mmolF/kg) in the 0.04 and 0.72 ppmF communities. Despite the increases were less 

pronounced in the 3.36 ppmF community, our results indicate that the use of a LF promotes a 

proportionally higher increase in plaque [F] when compared to C.

INTRODUCTION 

A series of studies has been conducted to evaluate the effect of fluoridated toothpastes on 

fluoride uptake by plaque and its retention throughout the day in communities with sub-

optimal (Whitford et al., 2005), optimal (Whitford et al., 2002; Pessan et al., 2006) and 

above-optimal (Pessan et al., 2008) water fluoride concentrations. Although small differences 

were found in the results among the studies, all of them agreed that intraoral fluoride levels 

were directly related to water fluoride concentrations regardless the dentifrice used, and that 

fluoride uptake by plaque is dependent on plaque calcium concentrations. Furthermore, 

because the latest study was conducted simultaneously in children from communities with 

0.04, 0.85 and 3.5 ?g F/mL in water, it was possible to observe for the first time that the 

increments in fluoride levels in plaque 1 h after brushing were virtually identical in each 

community. 

The reasons for this phenomenon, also found in a study conducted in individuals of similar 

age range and socioeconomic background (Whitford et al., 2005), are still not clear. 

Considering that fluoride levels in toothpaste are much higher than those found in water, it 

was expected that the use of fluoridated dentifrice could equalise the amount of fluoride 

retained in plaque 1 h after brushing, regardless the background fluoride exposure from water, 

but this did not happen. These findings led the investigators to hypothesize that fluoride in 

low concentration sources, as in water, penetrates deeper into plaque when compared to a 

high fluoride source, like dentifrice, since the use of these products could lead to the 

formation of salivary CaF+/CaF2 compounds, which would migrate predominantly onto 

plaque surface (Watson et al., 2005; Whitford et al., 2005, Pessan et al., 2008). 

Considering this hypothesis, it would be possible that the use of a dentifrice with a lower 

fluoride concentration could lead to a proportionally higher fluoride uptake by plaque when 

compared to a dentifrice containing 1,000-1,100 mgF/Kg. Since there is no agreement about 

the clinical efficacy of low-fluoride dentifrices on caries control when compared to 

conventional dentifrices (Ammari et al., 2003), the validation of this hypothesis could be 

useful for a better comprehension of the effects of such formulations on intraoral fluoride 

levels, which was demonstrated to be directly related to the clinical efficacy of topical 

fluoridated products (Duckworth et al., 1992).  

Thus, the present study was conducted following the same protocol of the study by Pessan et 

al. (2008) in order to verify if similar increments of fluoride would be found in plaque after 

the use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices, in communities with different fluoride

levels in water, and if the low-fluoride dentifrice would promote a proportionally higher 

fluoride retention in plaque in comparison to the conventional dentifrice. 

MATERIALS &amp;amp; METHODS 

Fifty-six 8-10-year-old Brazilian children from cities with different water fluoride 

concentrations, Pirajuí (0.04 ppm, n=19), Bauru (0.72 ppm, n=20) and Brejo das Freiras (3.36 

ppm, n=17), participated. Water fluoride concentrations were determined weekly through 

analysis of 4 samples from volunteers’ homes. Sample size was established at 15 subjects per 

group in order to obtain a power of 80% (?=0.05), based on a study conducted with the same 

protocol (Pessan et al., 2008). As inclusion criteria, the children were permanent residents of 

their community and from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, attended the same public 

school where samples were collected, and drank tap water exclusively. The protocol was 

approved by the IRB of Bauru Dental School1 and informed consent was obtained from 

children’s parents2.  

The study began with a dental prophylaxis to remove all plaque and calculus. The protocol of 

the study, described in detail in previous publications (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005, Pessan et 

al., 2006, 2008), followed a double-blind, crossover design, in which the volunteers were 

randomly assigned (blocking stratification) to brush with a conventional fluoride dentifrice 

(Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 mgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free 

placebo. The dentifrices’ tubes were coded by a researcher not involved in the present study. 

They used these products for 1.0 min in the morning and at bedtime for one week and rinsed 

with 10 mL of water3. The abrasive system in the calcium-free products was hydrated silica. 

During the sixth day, children brushed only the occlusal surfaces to allow plaque 

accumulation. After going to bed, they refrained from eating or drinking anything except 

water and did not brush their teeth until the following morning. On the following morning, 

plaque was collected from the right side of mouth; children then brushed the occlusal surfaces 

for 1.0 min and rinsed with 10 mL of tap water. One hour later plaque (left side) was again 

collected. Thus the samples were collected 1.0 hr and approximately 12 hr after the last use of 

the dentifrices. The entire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously 

used.

Plaque samples were dried at 95°C and weighed to the nearest microgram. Fluoride in plaque 

was determined after extraction with 0.5 M HClO4 which was buffered with TISAB I (Orion 

Research)4. Calcium concentrations were determined by AAS using an aliquot of the HClO4
digests of plaque. All analyses were done in duplicate and the coefficients of variability were 

6.9% and 7.1%, respectively for fluoride and calcium. 

The results are expressed as mean ± se. The outcomes were not normally distributed so log 

transformations were performed. A three-factor repeated measures ANOVA was then used to 

examine differences in each outcome. For pairwise comparisons, Tukey’s and Bonferroni’s 

tests were used, respectively for fluoride and calcium concentrations in plaque. The two fixed 

effect factors were fluoride dentifrice and time after toothbrushing and the independent factor 

was community. A significance level of 5% was selected. 

RESULTS 

Mean plaque fluoride concentrations were directly related to the water fluoride concentrations 

regardless the dentifrice used (Table 1). Significant interactions were observed between the 

factors communities and treatments (p&lt;0.05), as well as between communities and time after 

brushing (p&lt;0.001). For Pirajuí and Bauru, the use of the fluoridated pastes led to significant 

increases in plaque fluoride concentrations when compared to the placebo dentifrice 1h after 

brushing. No differences were verified between 1 and 12h after brushing with the fluoridated 

dentifrices, except for Pirajuí. For Brejo das Freiras, no significant differences were observed 

regardless of the dentifrice used and time after brushing. 

Although the values obtained for Bauru were numerically higher than those from Pirajuí 

(Table 1), a similar trend was observed for fluoride uptake by plaque (1h after brushing) in 

these communities (Figure 1). The increments in fluoride concentration 1h after brushing with 

the 513 mgF/Kg toothpaste were virtually identical (around 1.9 mmol F/kg).  For the 1,072 

mgF/Kg dentifrice the same trend was verified, with a mean increase around 2.4 mmolF/Kg 

1h after brushing. Regarding the differences between fluoride concentrations in plaque 1 and 

12h after brushing with the fluoride dentifrices (plaque fluoride clearance), plaque fluoride 

concentrations in Pirajuí and Bauru decreased about 43% 12h after brushing compared to the 

values found 1h after brushing for the 513 mgF/Kg dentifrice (Figure 2). For the 1,072 

mgF/Kg dentifrice, the % decrease was less uniform (47% and 30%, respectively, for Pirajuí

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

and Bauru). For Brejo das Freiras, however, both the increases and decreases in plaque 

fluoride concentrations were considerably lower when compared to the other communities. 

Regarding calcium concentrations in plaque, there was an interaction between the factors 

community and time of sample collection (p&lt;0.001), so that no pattern could be observed 

(Table 2). Overall, the data observed in Bauru were numerically higher than those observed in 

the other communities.  

DISCUSSION 

The studies conducted by Whitford et al. (2002, 2005) led to the hypothesis that the high 

fluoride levels in saliva after the use of a dentifrice would promote the formation of 

CaF+/CaF2 compounds. These would be less likely to migrate into the deeper layers of plaque 

when compared to the ionic form of fluoride present in water, but instead accumulate mainly 

in the outer layers (Watson et al., 2005; Whitford et al., 2005). Although this hypothesis was 

not fully tested, the results of the study by Pessan et al. (2008) provided additional evidence 

for it. In their study, an average increase of 6.5 mmol F/Kg was found in plaque 1 h after 

brushing with a 1,030 mgF/Kg dentifrice and these decreased at a similar rate (around 50%) 

for all communities, regardless the baseline fluoride levels in plaque associated with the 

regular consumption of water. In order to better understand this phenomenon, the present 

study was conducted using the same protocol described in the previous studies, but this time 

including a low-fluoride dentifrice, to allow dose-response observations.  

Plaque fluoride concentrations were directly related to fluoride concentrations in the drinking 

water, for all dentifrices used and times of sample collection, confirming the findings obtained 

by Pessan et al. (2008). However, the increments in plaque fluoride concentrations were about 

2-fold lower than those previously observed. The reasons for this are not evident. Both in the 

present study and in that by Pessan et al. (2008) samples were collected in the same season. 

Thus, variations due to differences in water consumption may not be the case. Additionally, 

care was taken in order to reproduce as much as possible the study by Pessan et al. (2008), so 

children from the same communities and same age range were selected and fluoride 

concentrations in the conventional dentifrices were virtually identical. The only difference 

between the studies was the volume of water to rinse the mouth after brushing, reduced from 

30 mL (Pessan et al., 2008) to 10 mL, which is more adequate for children (Issa and Toumba, 

2004); thus at least similar (if not higher) plaque fluoride levels could be expected. The only 

factor that might help to explain the lower values found in the present work is the amount of

?

sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) in the dentifrices. This anionic surfactant has strong affinity for 

calcium, which could affect fluoride uptake by plaque from a fluoride dentifrice (Whitford, 

personal communication). However, as the same source of the dentifrices was used in the 

present study and the other studies, this possibility does not seem to be the only explanation 

for the observed difference. 

Despite the unexpected lower values found in the present study, it was still possible to verify 

similar increments in plaque fluoride concentrations 1h after the use of low-fluoride (ca.1.9 

mmolF/kg) and conventional (ca. 2.4 mmolF/kg) dentifrices, for the communities of Pirajuí 

and Bauru, when comparing these values with the placebo levels, although these increases 

were considerably lower in the 3.36 ppmF community. It is noteworthy that considering the 2-

fold difference between fluoride concentrations in both toothpastes, a 100% increment of that 

obtained for the low-fluoride dentifrice would be expected after using the conventional 

dentifrice (around 3.8 mmol F/kg), but these were only around 63% higher (ca. 2.4 mmol 

F/kg). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the use of low-fluoride 

dentifrices promotes a proportionally higher uptake of fluoride by plaque when compared to 

conventional dentifrices. The lower fluoride concentration in the 513 mgF/Kg dentifrice 

would promote less formation of CaF2 and CaF+ compounds in saliva immediately after 

brushing, when compared to the 1,072 mgF/Kg dentifrice. Thus, it is reasonable to assume 

that a proportionally higher amount of fluoride in the ionic form would be present in saliva, 

which would be attracted as counterions to calcium bound to fixed acidic groups in plaque 

(Rølla, 1977; Rølla and Bowen, 1977) and bacterial cell surfaces (Rose et al., 1993, 1994, 

1996 and 1997). This mechanism is in agreement with the study by Watson et al. (2005) 

which demonstrated that fluoride is restricted mainly to the outer layers of dental plaque after 

exposure to a NaF solution.   

Another point that deserves attention regards the kinetics of fluoride clearance from dental 

plaque after the use of fluoride dentifrices, which seems to be different for low-fluoride and 

conventional dentifrices and also depends on the fluoride levels present in plaque from other 

sources than dentifrice (i.e., water). This is evident when we observe Figure 2. For the 513 

mgF/Kg dentifrice, ~ 40% of the fluoride incorporated in dental plaque at 1h was removed 

from plaque after 12h in Pirajuí and Bauru. However, in Brejo das Freiras, the clearance was 

much lower (~26%). Moreover, when a dentifrice with twice the fluoride concentration was 

used, the clearance remained unaltered for Pirajuí, but was lower for Bauru (~30%), while in 

Brejo das Freiras practically there was no clearance. These findings suggest that in conditions 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 1  23
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

of low fluoride supply (from water and/or dentifrice), the fluoride clearance from plaque is 

slower, while conditions of high supply may lead to faster plaque fluoride clearance. This 

may be due to the fact that in Brejo das Freiras the frequent exposure to water may have 

replenished the plaque fluoride reservoirs.  

According to a recent meta-analysis, no conclusion could be taken regarding the effectiveness 

of 500-550 mgF/Kg dentifrices against conventional formulations due to the lack of 

randomized controlled trials addressing this subject (Ammari et al., 2003). Although the 

present study did not investigate the effectiveness of low-fluoride dentifrices on caries 

prevalence, intraoral fluoride retention has been directly related to the clinical efficacy of 

topical products (Duckworth et al., 1992). Thus, considering that the low-fluoride formulation 

led to a proportionally higher retention of fluoride in plaque, it is possible that the differences 

between the clinical performances of low-fluoride and conventional toothpastes are lower 

than expected. This concept is supported by a recent randomized clinical trial that 

demonstrated that the use of low-fluoride toothpastes was as effective as the conventional 

formulation in preventing caries in caries-inactive, but not in caries-active children (Lima et 

al., 2008). Thus, based on caries-risk considerations, the use of low-fluoride formulations 

could constitute in a good alternative for caries control children, while minimizing the risk of 

dental fluorosis. 

The results of the present study provide additional information on the mechanism of fluoride 

uptake by plaque after the use of dentifrices with different fluoride concentrations, indicating 

that a proportionally higher amount of fluoride is retained in plaque after the use of low-

fluoride dentifrices compared to conventional formulations. Future studies, however, are 

needed in order to fully address this question. Information on the fluoride concentration in 

plaque fluid and in serial sections of dental plaque could help to clarify this mechanism.

ABSTRACT 

There is evidence that low-fluoride dentifrices (LFD) promote a proportionally higher plaque 

fluoride uptake when compared to conventional dentifrices (CD). We hypothesized that 

fluoride would be deposited predominantly in outer layers of plaque after exposure to CD, 

whereas it would migrate into deeper layers during exposure to LFD. This randomized, 

double-blind study evaluated fluoride and calcium distribution in sections of plaque biofilms 

generated in situ. Children brushed with a placebo dentifrice (PD), LFD and CD for 1 week 

(crossover design) and intact biofilms were collected 1 and 12 h after brushing. Fluoride and 

calcium were mostly restricted to the outer layers of biofilms for all dentifrices tested, and 

these ions were directly related throughout most of biofilm’s layers. Results for CD were 

significantly higher than those for PD, but did not differ from those obtained for LFD. Unlike 

our hypothesis, the use of LFD did not promote a higher F uptake in inner layers of biofilms.

INTRODUCTION  

Recent data has indicated that use of a fluoridated dentifrice (~1,000 µg F/g) resulted in 

virtual identical increases in plaque fluoride concentrations, which decreased at a similar rate, 

regardless of exposure to different local levels of fluoride in the drinking water (Pessan et al., 

2008). This raises questions concerning the control of fluoride uptake by dental plaque in 

relation to exposure to exogenous fluoride. Whitford et al. (2005) proposed that high levels of 

salivary fluoride during exposure to a conventional dentifrice (1,000-1,100 µg F/g) could lead 

to the deposition of CaF2/CaF+ compounds at the plaque/saliva interface, effectively forming 

some kind of a partial barrier at plaque surfaces to limit ionic fluoride diffusion into deeper 

regions.  However, based on the solubility product for CaF2, this effect would be attenuated 

with low fluoride sources because smaller amounts of insoluble calcium compounds would be 

formed. It would be reasonable to expect, therefore, that a low-fluoride dentifrice would lead 

to a lower formation of CaF2/CaF+ and, as a result, ionic fluoride could penetrate more easily 

into deeper layers of plaque biofilms. 

There is evidence that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice promotes a proportionally higher 

fluoride uptake by plaque when compared to a conventional dentifrice. The use of a dentifrice 

containing 513 µg F/g led to an increase around 1.9 mmol F/Kg in plaque fluoride 

concentrations 1 h after brushing, in communities with 0.04 and 0.72 ppm F in water. 

Considering a dose-response relationship, when a dentifrice containing 1,072 µgF/g was used 

the authors expected values twice higher than those obtained for the low-fluoride dentifrice 

(around 3.8 mmolF/Kg), but the increases observed were around 2.4 mmolF/Kg (Pessan et al., 

personal communication). This study add to the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis 

described above. The localization of fluoride in plaque after using conventional and low-

fluoride dentifrices, however, is unclear. In plaque biofilms exposed to a 1,000 ppm NaF 

solution, fluoride is restricted mainly in the outer layers (Watson et al., 2005), but no direct 

information is available for dentifrices, which are the most widespread form of topical use of 

fluorides. 

With regard to calcium, there is a positive relationship between fluoride and calcium in whole 

plaque (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005). Like fluoride, calcium tends to accumulate in the outer 

regions of plaque after exposure to fluoridated solutions (Robinson et al., 1997) but there is no 

information available on calcium concentrations in different layers of biofilm after the use of 

fluoride dentifrice.

Based on the mechanism proposed by Whitford et al. (2005) and on the information presented 

above, we have investigated the possibility that after exposure to a conventional dentifrice, 

fluoride would be retained predominantly in outer layers of plaque whereas it would migrate 

to deeper layers when a low-fluoride dentifrice was used. We also investigated the 

relationship between calcium and fluoride after such exposures. 

MATERIALS &amp;amp; METHODS 

Study protocol 

Eleven 8-10-year-old Brazilian children from an optimally fluoridated community (Bauru, 

0.72 ppm in the public water supply) participated. As inclusion criteria, children were from 

similar socioeconomic backgrounds, attended the same public school where samples were 

collected, and only drank tap water. The protocol was approved by the IRB of Bauru Dental 

School1 and informed consent was obtained from parents prior to the beginning of the study2. 

Plaque biofilms were generated using the 'Leeds In Situ Device', constructed as described by 

Robinson et al. (1997), except that devices’ rings were made by composite-resin instead of 

nylon3 (for sterilization procedures, please see Watson et al., 2004). Following a double-blind, 

crossover design, the volunteers were randomly assigned (blocking stratification) to brush with 

a conventional fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 

mgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free placebo for one week. After initial prophylaxis, one device was 

bonded to the buccal surface of each first upper molar by composite resin and worn for one 

week. During this time, children were instructed to brush twice daily, preferably avoiding the 

areas in which the devices had been bonded. They used approximately 0.5 g of the dentifrice 

supplied and rinsed their mouth with 10 mL of water after brushing4. After 7 days, devices were 

de-bonded and recovered intact 1 and approximately 12 hours after the last brushing episode. 

The devices with undisturbed plaque in situ were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 

entire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously used. 

Sample Embedding and Sectioning 

The protocol described by Watson et al. (2005) was followed. After overnight lyophilization 

(-50°C, 50 mbar vacuum), the devices were transferred to polyethylene capsules, impregnated

with methacrylate5 (24% v/v methylmethacrylate, 75% v/v butylmethacrylate, 1% v/v benzoyl 

peroxide) under vacuum for 30 min, which was then polymerized by overnight incubation 

(60°C)6. Embedded plaque was serially sectioned in a plane parallel to the underlying enamel 

substratum (starting on the uppermost surface of the resin ring), using an ultramicrotome 

(Reichert, Vienna, Austria). The sectioning regime was: 5×5 µm sections, followed by 1×4 

µm section and a further 5×5 µm sections. Each group of ten 5 µm sections was collected in 

an Eppendorf tube pooled to give a single plaque fluoride and calcium measurement. The 4 

µm sections were dried on glass slides for image analysis and determination of biomass 

fraction. This sectioning regime was repeated throughout biofilm’s depth until the enamel 

surface was reached7. 

Determination of Fluoride and Calcium Concentrations in Plaque Sections 

Chloroform (50 µL) was used to dissolve and disperse methacrylate from plaque sections in 

each Eppendorf tube. Tubes were then centrifuged (20,000 rpm, 30 min) and subsequently 

kept with lids open, allowing the chloroform to evaporate. Fluoride was extracted by 

overnight immersion in water (Duckworth et al., 1994) and analyzed by ion chromatography8. 

Calcium was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Kato et al., 1997). 

Determination of Fluoride and Calcium Concentrations in Biomass of Plaque Sections 

Sections of 4 µm were stained with 0.1% aqueous toluidine blue to reveal plaque biomass. 

Images were captured by a video camera (JVC 3-CCD) and analyzed with Zeiss KS300 

Imaging Software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), allowing the calculation of the area occupied by 

stained biomass9. Since the section thickness was known, plaque biomass volume within the 

section could be calculated. From these data, we were able to estimate fluoride and calcium 

concentrations in the plaque biomass, by dividing the total fluoride in each plaque section by 

the measured biomass fraction (Watson et al., 2005). 

Data (log transformed) were analyzed by two- and three-factor repeated measures ANOVA, 

respectively for sections analyzed together (sum of all sections for each device) and

separately, and by Tukey’s test. Linear regression analysis was used to verify the relationship 

between F and Ca in plaque. A significance level of 5% was selected. 

RESULTS 

Mean biofilm thickness was 848 (±101) µm, and ranged from 513 to 945 µm. Individual 

graphs for each device were plotted before performing ANOVA, revealing that both F and Ca 

were mainly restricted to the outer layers of plaque. Since an equal number of observations is 

needed to perform ANOVA, data were arranged taking the biofilm/saliva interface as the 

starting point for all the devices, so all the layers deeper than 513 µm (10th layer) were not 

included in this first statistical analysis. To determine whether there were any differences 

among the treatments close to dental surface (where de/remineralization processes occur), 

second statistical analysis was then performed. This second analysis was performed with 

enamel surface as the starting point for the 4 inner layers. Thus, ANOVA was performed for 

both the 10 outer layers and for the 4 inner layers of the plaque biofilms. 

For fluoride data, significant differences among treatments (F=6.547, p=0.007) and depths 

(F=51.631, p&lt;0.00001) were observed, with no interactions among the factors evaluated 

(p&gt;0.05). The use of the conventional dentifrice resulted in significantly higher fluoride levels 

in the biofilms than those obtained for the placebo (p = 0.005), regardless the time of sample 

collection. However, no differences were observed between placebo and low-fluoride or 

between low-fluoride and conventional dentifrices. 

Regarding biofilm depth, fluoride concentrations were significantly higher in the 3 outer 

layers when compared to the 7 deeper layers (Figure 1). Considering data arranged from the 

enamel surface, no significant differences were observed for the 4 inner layers (p&gt;0.05). 

For calcium concentrations, significant differences were verified among the layers 

(F=150.738, p&lt;0.00001), with significant interactions between the factors biofilm depth, 

treatments and time of sample collection (F=1.807, p=0.027). The four outer layers had 

significantly higher calcium concentrations when compared to the 6 inner layers (Figure 2). 

For the second ANOVA (data arranged from enamel surface), as observed for fluoride, no 

significant differences were observed among the layers. 

A moderate correlation was found between fluoride and calcium concentrations in each 

section of the biofilms collected. When combining all the 660 sections together (11 

volunteers, 10 outer sections, 3 treatments, 2 times after sample collection), the correlation 

coefficient was r = 0.49 (p&lt;0.001). Tables 1 and 2 show the individual coefficients of

determination when isolating the factors and for the 10 outer sections of the biofilms, 

respectively. 

Finally, data were also arranged considering each device as a whole unit (the sections were not 

taken into account), allowing comparisons with previous studies conducted with a similar 

protocol. The results from the 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant 

differences between treatments only (F=8.888, p=0.002); no difference was detected between 

times after sample collection (F=1.579, p=0.238), nor interactions between the two factors 

analyzed (F=0.797, p=0.464). The values obtained for the placebo dentifrice were significantly 

lower when compared to the low-fluoride (p=0.04) and the conventional (p=0.002) dentifrices, 

but no difference was verified between the fluoridated dentifrices (p=0.286). 

DISCUSSION

The study of fluoride distribution throughout plaque biofilms is important in elucidating the 

diffusion and retention of fluoride and the interactions between plaque, saliva and the 

underlying dental tissues (Robinson et al 1997,  Kato et al., 1997). To date, the most suitable 

method for studying the distribution of ions and other chemical agents (e.g. triclosan) within 

plaque is the Leeds in situ device. Due to the complex methodology involved, only 3 studies 

evaluating fluoride distribution in the biofilm have been reported, and all of them agreed that 

fluoride is mainly restricted to the outer layers of biofilm after exposure to a fluoridated 

solution (Robinson et al., 1997, Kato et al., 1997, Watson et al., 2005).  

Fluoride distribution in sections of biofilms after the use of a fluoridated dentifrice had still 

not been described, although it would be expected that a viscous vehicle might further limit 

penetration. This assumption was confirmed by the results of the present study. While fluoride 

was restricted mainly to the outer layers of biofilms (Figure 1), the concentrations of the ion 

were much lower than the reported in the above-mentioned studies. 

Some factors may explain the differences between the results obtained for fluoridated 

solutions and dentifrices. First, the dentifrice’s viscosity may reduce fluoride permeability into 

the biofilm, since biomass density increases from plaque/saliva interface inwards and the 

distribution of channels and voids decrease in this direction (Robinson et al., 2006). Moreover, 

studies with non dental-biofilms demonstrated that solute transfer through channels is more 

rapid than transfer through dense biomass, because of lower diffusion resistance (Zhang and 

Bishop, 1994). These studies together seem to explain the decrease in biofilm fluoride 

concentration from plaque/saliva interface towards enamel after exposure to a fluoridated

solution (Kato et al., 1997, Robinson et al., 1997, Watson et al., 2005). An additional possibility 

is that fluoride interacts with the surface of plaque biomass. Surface area/plaque biomass 

volume decreases from salivary interface towards the enamel and mirrors fluoride distribution 

(Robinson and Watson 2005). Second, children washed their mouth after brushing with the 

dentifrice, which considerably reduces oral fluoride concentrations (Duckworth et al., 1991). 

Third, other components in the dentifrice composition, such Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS), 

may compete with fluoride for calcium binding sites (Whitford, personal communication), 

besides producing alterations in biofilm’s structure. These would be induced either by removal 

of structural material (especially proteins) by the detergent, and by SLS binding to plaque 

constituents, which would cause mutual repulsion of endogenous components, thus altering the 

structure (Robinson et al., 2006). Fourth and last, samples were collected at least 1 h after 

exposure to the dentifrices, so no immediate analysis on fluoride distribution was carried out. 

Calculations on the fluoride diffusion coefficient in dental plaque illustrate that plaque 

thickness is an extremely important determinant of fluoride penetration. In plaque biofilms 

100 µm and 500 µm thick, exposure to a fluoridated solution for 20 min would deliver, 

respectively, 91% and 0.14% of the applied fluoride concentration to the tooth surface beneath 

the biofilm (Stewart, 2005). In the present study, biofilms were relatively thick (~ 850 µm), 

simulating plaque biofilms at caries prone sites (Sissons et al., 1992; Dibdin, 1993). These 

biofilms therefore are different from those obtained in the studies by Whitford et al. (2002, 

2005) and Pessan et al. (2008). Thus, when considering biofilm’s thickness along with 

dentifrice’s viscosity, mouth washing with water after brushing and dentifrice’s composition 

(especially SLS), it is not surprising to observe that fluoride concentrations in deeper layers of 

biofilms were not numerically different, regardless the dentifrice used.  

It is noteworthy that when each device was considered a whole unit, the fluoride 

concentrations followed the same pattern observed for a previous study when whole plaque 

was collected in vivo (Pessan, personal communication). However, this pattern was different 

when the biofilm’s layers were considered separately. This may have been due to the fact that 

biofilm samples in the in vivo study were collected from buccal and lingual surfaces, being 

therefore much thinner than samples collected with the devices. Based on the diffusion 

coefficients mentioned above (Stewart, 2005), and given that both studies followed the same 

treatment protocol, fluoride diffusion into in vivo plaque possibly occurred in a higher 

percentage of plaque when compared to the thick biofilms generated using the Leeds in situ

device. Additional studies should be conducted in order to evaluate fluoride distribution in 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 2  39
?

serial sections of plaque biofilms with a thickness compatible to biofilms formed in vivo in 

order that our hypothesis could be more precisely addressed.  

Plaque fluoride and calcium concentrations have been demonstrated to be positive and 

significantly correlated in whole plaque biofilms (Whitford et al., 2002, 2005; Pessan et al., 

2006, 2008), suggesting that plaque fluoride and calcium concentrations are interdependent. 

Our data shows that fluoride and calcium distribution profiles through biofilm’s depth were 

quite similar for all the dentifrices tested (Figures 1 and 2), supporting previous findings 

obtained in biofilms exposed to a fluoridated solution (Kato et al., 1997). In addition, these 

ions are positively and significantly correlated when all data are combined, especially for 

samples collected 1h after brushing (Table 1), and the coefficients of determination were 

significant for most layers when considered separately (Table 2).  These results support the 

view that fluoride is retained in plaque mainly through calcium-binding sites.  

As fluoride concentrations in the biofilm have been reported to be inversely associated with 

caries increments and activity (Duckworth et al., 1992; Gaugler and Bruton, 1982), the 

development of new formulations able to penetrate fluoride into deeper layers of dental 

biofilm is extremely desirable. Based on the premise that fluoride retention in plaque is 

mediated by calcium-binding sites, it is possible that increasing the availability of calcium in 

plaque would increase fluoride uptake. Rinses, dentifrices and chewing gums containing 

calcium in different formulations and concentrations have been used for such purposes, but 

with inconsistent results (Whitford et al., 2005, Vogel et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b, Pessan et 

al., 2006), so the hypothesis still remains to be proved. Other alternatives include dentifrices 

with a reduced pH and with a lower viscosity. The use of a dentifrice containing 550 µg F/g, 

at pH 4.5 led to significantly higher fluoride concentrations in whole biofilm when compared 

to a conventional dentifrice (1,100 µg F/g, pH 7.0) (Buzalaf et al., 2009). In addition, the use 

of a liquid dentifrice promoted higher fluoride concentrations in whole biofilm when 

compared to toothpastes, at same pH and fluoride concentrations (Buzalaf et al., 2009). For 

both dentifrice’s pH and consistency, however, the distribution of fluoride within biofilm 

layers remains unclear.

Abstract 

There is evidence that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice (LFD) leads to a proportionally 

higher plaque fluoride concentration ([F]) when compared to a conventional dentifrice (CD), 

but no information is available on plaque fluid [F]. This double-blind, crossover study 

evaluated whole plaque and plaque fluid [F], as well as whole plaque calcium concentrations 

([Ca]) after brushing with a placebo dentifrice (PD), LFD and CD. Children (n=20) were 

randomly assigned to brush twice daily with one of the dentifrices, during 7 days. Samples 

were collected at 1 and 12 h after brushing. The use of the fluoridated dentifrices significantly 

increased plaque [F]s 1 h after brushing when compared to PD. Plaque fluid [F]s were not 

affected by the [F] in the dentifrice, but were significantly higher 1 h after brushing; a similar 

trend was observed for plaque [Ca]. Positive and significant correlations were found between 

plaque [F] and [Ca] under most of the conditions evaluated. The mean increase in plaque [F] 

observed 1 h after brushing with the CD were about 47% higher than those obtained for the 

LFD, supporting the assumption that the use of a LFD promotes  proportionally higher 

increases in plaque [F] when compared to a CD.

Introduction 

The use of fluoridated toothpastes has been regarded as one of the most effective 

means for caries control worldwide (1), since it combines the mechanical removal or 

disruption of dental plaque with the caries-protective effect of fluoride (2). Although the 

contribution of fluoridated toothpastes on caries reduction is well documented in both 

developed and developing countries, the use of these products has also been associated to an 

increase in the prevalence of dental fluorosis (3), due to the ingestion of high amounts of 

dentifrice during toothbrushing, especially by young children (4). 

Among the strategies to minimize fluoride intake from this source, the use of low-

fluoride dentifrices has been recommended, although the evidences for the clinical efficacy of 

such formulations are still controversial when compared to dentifrices containing of 1,000-

1,100 µg F/g. (5). Considering that dental caries is a plaque-dependent disease and that 

demineralization of tooth structure will occur only on surfaces underneath dental plaque, the 

amount of fluoride retained at this compartment is of paramount importance from a clinical 

perspective, since fluoride can be released from plaque during a cariogenic challenge, 

delivering the ion to the plaque fluid and, therefore, to enamel under plaque (6). 

A recent study demonstrated that fluoride uptake by dental plaque at both 1 and 12 h 

was not significantly different after the use of dentifrices containing 513 and 1,072 µg F, 

suggesting that the use of the low-fluoride formulation is able to promote a proportionally 

higher fluoride uptake when compared to the conventional dentifrice (Pessan et al., IADR 

Meeting, 2009). The bioavailability of fluoride in the plaque fluid under clinical conditions, 

however, is still now known. The only study described so far used an in situ protocol, with a 

monospecific artificial test plaque, so the results cannot be directly extrapolated to in vivo

conditions (7).

As the plaque fluid is the site at which fluoride influences de- and remineralization 

processes, the aim of the present study was to assess fluoride uptake by dental plaque and 

plaque fluid, using the same protocol described by Pessan et al. (IADR Meeting, 2009). 

Plaque calcium concentrations were also evaluated, as it has been reported that plaque 

fluoride uptake is dependent on plaque calcium concentrations (8-10). 

Material and Methods 

Twenty 8-10-year-old Brazilian children, residents in an optimally fluoridated 

community (Bauru, 0.72 ppm F in the public water supply), participated. Sample size was 

established at 15 subjects per group in order to obtain a power of 80% (?=0.05), based on a 

study conducted with the same protocol (10). As inclusion criteria, children presented good 

oral health status, were not using medicines during the experimental protocol and drank tap 

water exclusively. The protocol was approved by the IRB of Bauru Dental School1 and 

informed consent was obtained from children’s parents2.  

The study began with a dental prophylaxis to remove all accessible plaque and 

calculus. The protocol of the study, described in detail in previous publications (2,8-10), 

followed a double-blind, crossover design, in which the volunteers were randomly assigned 

(blocking stratification) to brush with a conventional fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 1,072 mgF/kg, 

Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States), a low-fluoride dentifrice (Crest, 513 

mgF/Kg) or a fluoride-free placebo. The dentifrices’ tubes were coded by a researcher not 

involved in the present study. They used these products for 1.0 min in the morning and at 

bedtime for one week and rinsed with 10 mL of water3. The abrasive system in the calcium-

free products was hydrated silica.

During the sixth day, children brushed only the occlusal surfaces to allow plaque 

accumulation. After going to bed, they refrained from eating or drinking anything except 

water and did not brush their teeth until the following morning. On the following morning, 

plaque was collected from the right side of mouth; children then brushed the occlusal surfaces 

for 1 min and rinsed with 10 mL of tap water. One hour later plaque (left side) was again 

collected. Thus the samples were collected 1 h and approximately 12 h after the last use of the 

dentifrices. The entire protocol was then repeated using the dentifrices not previously used. 

Plaque samples were collected from all accessible surfaces using a Hollenback carver, 

immediately transferred to plastic strips and then placed inside oil-filled centrifuge tubes (11). 

After determination of the sample weight (± 10 µg), the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min 

(14,000 rpm) at 4°C to separate the fluid from the plaque solids. The fluid was recovered with 

oil-filled capillary micropipettes, which were used to transfer the fluid to the fluoride 

electrode for analysis, as described below4. After fluid extraction, plaque solids were kept 

frozen until the extraction of acid-soluble whole plaque F and Ca5. The tip of the centrifuge 

tube was cut (11), and the remaining plaque was centrifuged into a 2.0 mL microcentrifuge 

tube containing 0.5 M HCl (500 µL/10 mg of plaque, wet weight) (6). The samples were 

agitated by being rotated at 30 rpm for 3 h at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged. 

The supernatant was collected and neutralized with 1 M NaOH (250 µL/10 mg of plaque, wet 

weight) and kept frozen until analyses. TISAB III (Thermo Orion, Beverly, Massachusetts, 

United States) was added (1:10) just before analysis. Fluoride analysis of all the samples was 

done on the surface of an oil-covered inverted F electrode (9409, Thermo Orion, Beverly, 

Massachusetts, United States) with the use of a microscope and micro-reference electrode, 

held in a micromanipulator, to close the circuit (11). Plaque fluid samples were diluted with 

TISAB III (1:10) on the surface of the F electrode by means of micropipettes (11). Calcium

concentrations were determined colorimetrically in triplicate at 650 nm (FLUOstar OPTIMA, 

BMG Labtech, Germany). Preparation of the samples for measuring calcium concentration 

was conducted with the Arsenazo III method (6,12). For the analyses of total Ca in whole 

plaque, the standards also contained TISAB III.  

Data passed normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and homogeneity (Levene) tests and 

were then analyzed by two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA. Tukey’s test was used as the 

post hoc test for ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation was used to verify the relationships between 

fluoride concentrations in whole plaque and plaque fluid, as well as between fluoride and 

calcium concentrations in whole plaque. The significance level was set at 5%. 

Results 

Table 1 shows mean concentrations of fluoride in whole plaque and plaque fluid, as 

well as calcium concentrations in whole plaque. A dose-response relationship could be 

observed for mean whole plaque fluoride concentrations, when considering each time of 

sample collection separately. The values obtained at 12 h after brushing were 0.88, 1.09 and 

0.96 µmol/g and 1 h after brushing were 1.06, 1.64 and 1.96 µmol/g, respectively for the 

placebo, 513 µg F/g and 1,030 µg F/g dentifrices. No significant differences, however, were 

observed among the dentifrices (F=2.69, p=0.08). Significant differences were observed 

between times of sample collection (F=17.99, p&lt;0.001), as well as for the interaction between 

treatments and times of sample collection (F=3.37, p&lt;0.05). 

Plaque fluid fluoride concentrations at 1 h after brushing were significantly higher 

than the correspondent values for 12 h after brushing (F=19.72, p&lt;0,001). No significant 

differences were observed among the dentifrices (F=0.22; p=0.81). For calcium 

concentrations in whole plaque, a similar trend was observed, with significant differences 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 3  54
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

between times of sample collection (F=5.98, p&lt;0.05) and no differences among the dentifrices 

(F=0.06; p=0.94). 

Plaque fluoride and calcium concentrations were positively and significantly 

correlated for most of the situations tested. The highest coefficients of determination were 

observed for the low-fluoride (r=0.67, p=0,001) and conventional dentifrices (r=0.72, 

p&lt;0.0001), both at 1 h after brushing (Table 2). When all values were analyzed together, the 

coefficient of determination was r=0.53 (p&lt;0.0001). No relationship between plaque fluid and 

whole plaque fluoride concentrations could be observed for any of the situations tested 

individually. When all data were considered together, the coefficient of determination was 

r=0.27 (p=0.77). 

Discussion 

The study of the mineral composition of dental plaque is of great importance from a 

clinical perspective, since plaque fluoride concentrations are inversely related to caries 

incidence and activity (13,14), and directly related to the clinical efficacy of topical fluoride 

formulations (15). The results of the present study demonstrated that, in an area with 

optimally fluoridated water, plaque fluoride concentrations 1 h after brushing with a 

conventional or a low-fluoride dentifrice are not significantly differently from each other. In 

addition, the values obtained for the conventional dentifrice were only 47% higher than those 

obtained for the placebo dentifrice 1 h after brushing, confirming previous findings that the 

use of the low-fluoride formulation leads to a proportionally higher plaque fluoride uptake 

when compared to a conventional dentifrice (Pessan et al., IADR Meeting, 2009). It is 

important to point out that the data reported by Pessan et al. (IADR Meeting, 2009) were 

obtained using a different method of fluoride analysis (HClO4 extraction, dry plaque) than the 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 3  55

one employed in the present study (HCl extraction, wet plaque under oil), which gives 

additional credibility to the data obtained.   

The above-mentioned findings seem to be supported by a recent randomized clinical 

trial, which concluded that the anticaries effect of a low-fluoride dentifrice was similar to the 

conventional dentifrice when used by caries-inactive, but not caries-active children, residents 

in an area with low-fluoride concentrations in the drinking water (16). Considering the 

similarity of the values obtained 1 h after brushing with both toothpastes in the present study 

(conducted in an optimally fluoridated area), it could suggested that the differences in the 

clinical performances of conventional and low-fluoride formulations seem to be smaller than 

currently believed (5). This would occur especially in an optimally fluoridated area, where 

intraoral fluoride reservoirs can be replenished at a higher frequency from water besides the 

use of the fluoridated dentifrice. It must be emphasized, however, that the present protocol did 

not evaluate fluoride concentrations immediately after toothbrushing. It is possible that the 

higher fluoride levels in plaque shortly after exposure to a conventional toothpaste may have a 

great impact on the remineralization of early carious lesions in caries-active individuals, when 

compared to the use of a low-fluoride formulation. Time-course studies could bring additional 

information on fluoride uptake and clearance from both the solid and fluid phases of plaque 

after the use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices. Therefore, as concluded by Lima et 

al. (16), caries activity may be taken into account when recommending a low-fluoride 

dentifrice. 

 The significant increases in plaque fluoride concentrations after the use of the 

fluoridated dentifrices were not reflected in the fluid phase of plaque (Table 1), what could be 

explained by several factors, mainly the lag time between the brushing episode and the first 

plaque sample collection, along with considerations on oral fluoride clearance. However, the 

present results are not in agreement with those described in a recent in situ study, which 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 3  56
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship in plaque fluid fluoride concentrations 30 min 

after exposure to conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices, as well as 45 min after plaque 

exposure to a sucrose solution (75 min after toothbrushing) (7). Although the study by Tenuta 

et al. (7) provided additional information about plaque fluid fluoride concentrations after the 

use of a low-fluoride dentifrice, some differences between their protocol and that used in the 

present study must be addressed. In the study by Tenuta et al. (7), enamel blocks were pre-

treated with slurries of dentifrices for 5 minutes, the volunteers did not spit out the dentifrice’s 

foam after brushing, a monospecific artificial test plaque was used and the contact area with 

saliva and plaque was too small when compared to plaque present in smooth surfaces (as in 

the present study), what may have substantially reduced salivary clearance in their study. In 

contrast, in the present report there was no pre-treatment of enamel surfaces, children spat the 

foam out after brushing and rinsed their mouths with water, a natural plaque was assessed and 

the contact area between plaque and saliva was substantially higher. Therefore, the limitations 

of the protocol used by Tenuta et al. (2009) do not allow a direct extrapolation of the results 

to in vivo conditions.  

It was noteworthy that plaque fluid fluoride concentrations observed at 1 h after 

brushing were significantly higher than those obtained at 12 h, regardless the dentifrice used. 

Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed for whole plaque calcium concentrations (Table 

1), what has already been observed in previous studies using the same research protocol 

(2,10). Considering that all the dentifrices were silica-based (calcium-free), the only 

reasonable explanation seems to be the influence of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) on plaque 

structure (Whitford et al., AADR Meeting, 2008). It was demonstrated that SLS is able to 

produce alterations in plaque structure induced either by removal of structural material 

(especially proteins), and by SLS binding to plaque constituents, which would cause mutual 

repulsion of endogenous components (17). It is reasonable to assume that the expansion in 



______________________________________________________________________ Capítulo 3  57
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

plaque structure would increase the mobility of ions in plaque and, therefore, in its fluid 

phase, reason by which increases in both plaque fluid fluoride concentrations and in whole 

plaque calcium concentration were seen 1 h after brushing even for the placebo dentifrice. 

Such hypothesis deserves to be further investigated, since it may have significant implications 

on the fluoride uptake by dental plaque after the use of dentifrices. 

Plaque fluoride concentrations were positively and significantly correlated to plaque 

calcium concentrations under most of the conditions of the study, confirming previous 

findings that plaque fluoride concentrations are dependent on plaque calcium concentrations 

(2,8-10). As a completely plaque-free situation is impossible in a clinical situation, the 

amount of fluoride retained in plaque may be determinant on the fate of the enamel beneath 

plaque, since fluoride can be released from this compartment during a cariogenic challenge, 

influencing on the remineralization process. Therefore, strategies to increase plaque fluoride 

concentrations should be based on methods to increase the fraction of plaque Ca capable of 

reacting with and retaining F (2). 

This is the first clinical study that evaluated plaque fluid fluoride concentrations after 

the use of conventional and low-fluoride dentifrices. Although the results for the whole 

plaque confirm previous findings that the use of a low-fluoride dentifrice promotes a 

proportionally higher plaque fluoride uptake 1 h after brushing when compared to a 

conventional dentifrice, such increases are not reflected in the plaque fluid. The reason for 

this is possibly the establishment of an equilibrium between the fluoride in the oral fluids 

(saliva and plaque fluid), which are highly influenced by the salivary clearance. SLS also 

seems to influence plaque and plaque fluid fluoride concentrations, which deserves to be 

further investigated.

ANEXO 1: Instruções aos autores – Journal of Dental Research 

MANUSCRIPTS  

Prepare manuscript, tables, legends, and footnotes as double-spaced text (a minimum of 6 mm between lines) 
formatted for 8-1/2 x 11-inch paper. Top, bottom, and side margins should be one inch, with no indented 
paragraphs. Figures and tables should not exceed 8-1/2 x 11 inches. Both Macintosh (Framemaker, MacWrite, 
Word, WordPerfect, Works WP, or WriteNow) and IBM PC (DCA-RFT, FrameMaker, MultiMate, Office 
Writer, Text, Word for Windows, WordPerfect, WordStar, Works WP, or XYWrite) files will be accepted. 
Manuscripts should be "clean", i.e., free of tabs and codes. Bold and italic type should appear exactly as they 
will appear on the printed page. Italicize items that will appear in italics; this will include the genus and species 
of an organism, g (for gravitational force), Latin words and abbreviations (for example, e.g., i.e., in vitro, in vivo, 
et al.), and journal names in the References section. Tabs should be used to separate columns within tables. Do 
not use elaborate table formatting.  

Use a standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial to avoid misrepresentation of your data on different 
computers that do not have the unusual or foreign language fonts.  

Title and Section Headings  

Bold type should be used for the title on page 1. Use upper- and lower-case letters. First-level headings, which 
include ABSTRACT, INTRODUCTION, MATERIALS &amp;amp; METHODS, RESULTS, DISCUSSION, 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, and REFERENCES should be bold type, all upper-case letters, as shown. Second-
level subheads should be bold type, upper- and lower-case. Third-level subheads should be bold type, upper- and 
lower-case, with a paragraph indent. Any lower-ranked subheads should be italicized, and in upper- and lower-
case. Please type no more than 10 characters per inch. Authors are reminded to include their complete mailing 
addresses, telephone, FAX, and e-mail addresses, as available. Copies of "in press" and "submitted" manuscripts 
that will provide essential information for the referees should also be enclosed.  

A Few Words About Style  

Authors should remember that they are writing to communicate to often-uninformed readers. Here are a few 
suggestions: Show a clear chronological progression and logic to the development of your ideas throughout the 
manuscript and within paragraphs and sentences. Speak to the reader in a direct and straightforward voice. Tell 
the reader your purpose, then provide background, data, and conclusions. You will make your point most 
effectively by illustrating with a well-chosen example, rather than providing an encyclopedic discourse. In each 
paragraph and sentence, stick to the subject. For example, if the subject is "biophysical properties", don't write 
sentences in that paragraph that change the subject to the names of cited contributors. Each sentence should 
contain only one thought. Write short and simple sentences. Choose the best word so that you say what you 
mean. To make your information accessible to the widest possible audience, avoid jargon, acronyms, and 
needless words. Before submission, contributors must review their manuscripts with (i) computer grammar and 
spelling tools/filters and (ii) a colleague who is expert in English language grammar and syntax. Manuscripts 
may be returned without review or rejected on the basis of poor English or accepted standards of style. Check to 
ensure that all listed references, figures, and tables are cited in the text and that all cited references, figures, and 
tables are presented in appropriate sections. The Editor reserves the right to make changes to improve the clarity 
of the text. All such changes will be subject to contributors' approval before publication.  

Revised Manuscripts  

All revisions must be accompanied by a cover letter signed by all authors to the Editor. The letter must (i) detail 
on a point-by-point basis the contributors' disposition of each of the referees' comments, and (ii) certify that all 
contributors approve of the revised content and that the manuscript complies with stipulations 'i' through 'iv' in 
"General Policy". Responses to separate reviewers should be on separate pages. Also include a copy of the 
revision with all changes highlighted.  

RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS  

Effective January 2004, manuscripts reporting a randomized clinical trial should follow the CONSORT 
guidelines as published in the Annals of Internal Medicine (Ann Int Med 134:657-662, 2001). Click here to 
download the checklist. This completed checklist file should be uploaded as Supplemental Material.  

The Journal encourages authors to register their clinical trials in a public trials registry, and we ask authors of 
manuscripts describing such studies to submit the name of the registry and the study registration number prior to 
publication. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors plans to consider clinical trials for 



_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  65
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

publication only if they have been registered (see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1 - 
http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/351/12/1250). The following registries meet these requirements: 
http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov and http://controlled-trials.com/isrctn/submission/.  

GENE DATA  

Prior to submission, the Journal asks that novel gene sequences be deposited in a public database (GenBank, 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/submit.html, EMBL, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Submission/index.html, 
or DDBJ http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/sub-e.html), and the accession number provided to the JDR. Manuscript 
submissions including microarray data should (a) include the information recommended by the MIAME 
http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html guidelines in their submission, and/or (b) identify the 
submission details for the experimental details to one of the publicly available databases (ArrayExpress 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ or GEO http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  

MANUSCRIPT COMPONENTS  

The components of a manuscript should be: 1) title page, 2) abstract, 3) introduction,4) materials and methods, 5) 
results, 6) discussion, 7) acknowledgments, 8) references, 9) tables, and 10) figure legends. The complete 
manuscript should be arranged in that order. Number all pages consecutively in the top right-hand corner, 
including the title page. Label figures clearly. Each figure label must indicate the number corresponding to the 
citation in the text, an arrow indicating the top, and contributors' abbreviated names.  

1) Title Page (page 1) 

Type in bold type with only the first letters of the main words capitalized. The title should be brief (not to exceed 
60 characters) and illustrative of the key finding. Also type the contributors' initials and last names in upper- and 
lower-case letters. Use superscript numbers to relate contributors to different departments or institutions, or to 
indicate a change in address. For the corresponding author who will receive reprint requests, provide the full 
postal (including ZIP or Postal Code) and e-mail addresses, telephone and FAX numbers, as available. If the 
corresponding author is not the first author, indicate by a number superscript, and use the phrase "corresponding 
author", and that individual's e-mail address. The following information must be included on the cover page: 1) a 
short title (running head) of up to 45 characters; 2) three to five key words; 3) the number of words in the 
abstract; 4) the number of words in the abstract and the text (excluding tables, figure legends, acknowledgments, 
and cited references); 5) the number of tables and figures; and 6) the number of cited references. If applicable, 
include source footnotes on page 1 to indicate prior preliminary publication. For example, state that the work 
was "Based on a thesis submitted to the graduate faculty, Azimuth University, in partial fulfillment of the 
requirements for the PhD degree" or that a preliminary report was presented at, or published in... Report all 
sources of funding in a later section, "Acknowledgments".  

2) Abstract (page 2) 

A self-standing summary of the text, this section should not exceed one typed page (about 150 words). Concisely 
describe the (i) background and rationale, (ii) hypothesis or study objective, (iii) design and key methods, (iv) 
essential results, and (v) conclusions. Avoid abbreviations. The abstract will be re-published separately by 
information retrieval services. 

3) Introduction (page 3) 

Briefly and clearly describe the background and rationale for the stated hypothesis to be tested or objective to be 
studied. Sufficient detail must be provided to permit the interdisciplinary reader to evaluate the results without 
review of earlier publications. Describe and cite only the most relevant earlier studies; avoid presentation of an 
exhaustive review of the field. Do not include a summary of the results presented in the manuscript.  

4) Materials &amp;amp; Methods 

To provide sufficient technical information so that the experiments can be repeated, the (i) experimental or study 
design, (ii) specific procedures, and (iii) type of statistical analysis must be described clearly and carefully. Use 
section subheadings in a logical order to title each category or method. Previously published methods should be 
named (e.g., "ultrasonic treatment" rather than mention of the cited contributors' names) and cited. New methods 
must be described completely. Present the data that validate the new method. A method used for only part of one 
experiment may be described briefly in the "Results" section, table footnote, or figure legend. Present descriptive 
information about large numbers of experimental reagents, microbes, test materials, primer sequences, in tabular 
form with a brief explanation in the text. Proprietary names and sources of supply of all commercial products 
must be given in parentheses in the text (name and model of product, company, city, and state or country). 
Report generic names and terms wherever possible. For protocols involving the use of human subjects or 



_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  66
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

specimens, indicate succinctly that subjects' rights have been protected by an appropriate institutional review 
board and informed consent was granted. When laboratory animals are used, indicate the level of institutional 
review and assurance that the protocol ensures humane practices.  

5) Results  

This section serves only to introduce data in the (i) text, (ii) tables, and (iii) figures and to call attention to their 
significant parts. Report results concisely, using tables and figures to present important differences or similarities 
that cannot otherwise be presented or summarized in the text. The rationale and design of experiments should be 
made clear in the previous sections of the manuscript. Reserve subjective comments, interpretation, or reference 
to the previous literature for the "DISCUSSION". Number tables and figures in the order in which they are 
described and cited in the text. All tabular data should identify and report (i) either standard deviation values or 
standard errors of the means, (ii) the number of replicate determinations or human or animal subjects, and (iii) 
probability values and name(s) of statistical test(s) for reported differences. Restrict presentation of photo- and 
electron micrographs to those essential to the results. If essential to the results, color can be published at the 
discretion of the Editor. (The cost for color in reprints, however, must be borne by the author. For cost estimates, 
contact the Central Office at               703-548-0066       , or FAX 703-548-1883, e-mail publications@iadr.org.)  

6) Discussion  

Explain and interpret the results with a scientifically critical view of the previously published work in the field. 
Highlight the advances made by the new data. Indicate the limitations of the findings. State the conclusions of 
the report, and explain why they are merited by the data. This is the only proper section for subjective comments.  

7) Acknowledgments 

Recognize individuals who provided assistance to the project. Report all sources of grant and other support for 
the project or study, including funds received from contributors' institutions and commercial sources, and do not 
refer to a study being only partially funded by the cited sources. Consultancies and funds paid directly to 
investigators must also be listed, with statements such as "This investigation was supported in part by USPHS 
Research Grant DE-0000-00 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes 
of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892".  

8) References (maximum, 35)  

This section will list all sources cited in the paper. Arrange the citations in alphabetical order by last name of the 
first author without numbering. When citing a reference in the text, provide attribution for the subject under 
discussion. For example, "Cold fusion has been difficult to replicate (Williams and Jones, 1988), but some recent 
modifications in experimental design (Jones et al., 1989) continue to stimulate new investigation." Avoid "Jones 
et al. (1989) found..." or "In a recent study, Jones (1990) found...", which creates vague statements because the 
subject is shifted from "cold fusion" to the names of the cited contributors. Use "et al." (in italics) when the cited 
work is by three or more contributors. When the cited work is by two contributors, use both surnames separated 
by "and". When citing multiple references by the same author(s) in the same year, use "a", "b", etc. (e.g., Jones, 
1980b). Multiple references should be listed in chronological order of publication, separated by semi-colons. 
"Unpublished observations" and "personal communications" may be inserted into and cited (in parentheses) in 
the text with written permission from the correspondents, but are not to be used as references. Abbreviate journal 
names according to the style used in Index Medicus. Other titles should be formatted with slight modifications of 
the style used by the US National Library of Medicine in Index Medicus. Examples of reference citation formats 
are illustrated below. Avoid using abstracts as references. Data from abstracts should be referenced as “personal 
communication” or “unpublished observations” as appropriate. When citing a Web site, list the authors and title 
if known, then the URL and the date it was accessed (in parentheses). Include among the references papers 
accepted but not yet published; designate the journal and add "(in press)". Information from manuscripts 
submitted but not yet accepted should be cited in the text as "unpublished observations" (in parentheses). The 
references must be verified by the author(s) against the original documents and checked for correspondence 
between references cited in the text and listed in the "References" section.  

Examples of correct forms of references are listed below. They are single-spaced here for illustration but should 
be double-spaced in the manuscript.

9) Tables and 10) Figures (maximum, four total)  

9) Tables 

Type one table per page. In the order of mention in the text, number each table consecutively with Arabic 
numerals in the heading. In the heading, follow the table number with a brief descriptive title, generally 
highlighting the key result. Design tables to highlight key results and comparisons. Make every effort to make 
the presentation of data clear, simple, and uncluttered. As column headings, use accurate descriptors instead of 
symbols, acronyms, and abbreviations. To avoid overlong titles and cumbersome tables, use explanatory 
footnotes whenever possible. In the table or title, indicate the order of footnotes with superscript a,b,c,d,e,f, ... If 
needed in footnotes, cite the short form of references in parentheses. In tabular columns and the text, decimals 
less than unity must have the decimal point preceded by a zero. To ensure that the presentation is clear, report 
only the number of significant digits appropriate to the sensitivity and discrimination of the measure and the 
differences to be illustrated. Column headings should be simple and clear so that tables will be understandable 
without consultation of the text. Generally, column headings identify dependent variables, while independent 
variables are identified by row descriptors on the left. Tables will usually be printed either 3-1/4 or 7 inches 
wide.  

10) Figures  

Figures are illustrative materials, including photomicrographs, radiographs, charts, and graphs. When possible, 
an electronic copy of the figure should be provided on a diskette with the text of the manuscript. Digitized 
figures must be certified by the contributors to be an accurate representation of the original data and not 
electronically edited. Figures must be discussed thoroughly in the text. Black-and-white photographic prints, 
laser-quality reproductions, and original drawings on opaque white paper are preferred. Color reproductions will 
be published free at the discretion of the Editor. Authors wishing to pay to publish color figures should contact 
the Publications Department at the Central Office, at               703-548-0066       , e-mail publications@iadr.org. 
Prices are listed on the Page Charge/Reprint Order Form. An original and two copies of each figure must be 
submitted. Each set should be placed in a protective folder, one labeled "for printer" and the other two "for 
review". On the back of each figure, oriented upright, label with contributors' names and figure number (and 
letter) in sequence corresponding to its mention in the text. Figures will generally be printed column-width, 1-1/2 
columns' width, or page-width. Extraneous material should be cropped out to ensure minimal reduction. If crop 
marks are necessary, do not place them directly on the figure. Mount the figure on a sheet of paper and place the 
crop marks on the paper. Photomicrographs must include a scale of the form |________|, clearly labeled with a 
convenient unit of length, e.g., 50 m. Graphs should be labeled briefly and clearly at the abscissa and ordinate, 
including the units of measure. All figures must be labeled to allow for easy readability and visualization if 
reduced by 50% or more. If possible, determine the percentage reduction at which the figure will be reproduced 
(e.g., 3-1/4 or 7 inches wide). Print a copy at that percentage to see how all elements will be affected. Consider 
that any line or rule thinner than 1/2 point may not reproduce. Patterns used in bar charts can become illegible, 
thus rendering useless any keys provided for graphs. Ideally, all figures should be provided at the optimum size 
for publication. The title and other identification may appear in the legend.  

Legends 
Legends for all figures, including charts and graphs, must be typed together on a separate page and should be 
understandable without reference to the text. Include a title highlighting the key result and a key for any symbols 
or abbreviations used in the figure.

AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCES  

The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged) will be used as the authority for 
spelling of non-medical terms. Where two plural forms are provided, the American English form will be used. 
For anatomical nomenclature, Nomina Anatomica (5th ed.) and Dorland's Illustrated Dictionary will be 
considered authoritative.  

NOMENCLATURE  

Authors should refer to the International System of Units (SI), D.T. Goldman and R.J. Bell, Eds., NBS Special 
Publication 330 (1981). This booklet is available from the US Dept. of Commerce, National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, Washington, DC 20234. Use of correct symbols includes m for milli-, for micro-, 
and L for liter (as in mL, L, etc.). Express grams as g, hours as hr, seconds as sec, and centrifugal force as g (e.g., 
10,000 g). Use nm rather than Angstroms. Concentrations should be expressed as mol/L or mmol/L, etc. Insert 
leading zeros in all numbers less than 1.0 in the text, tables, and figures. 

Numbers of ten and fewer should be written out (e.g., ten subjects), except when indicating inanimate quantities 
(e.g., 10 mL), and numbers that are greater than ten should appear as digits. Always use digits to express dates, 
dimensions, degrees, doses, periods of time, percentages, proportions, ratios, sums of money, statistical results, 
weights, and measures, or to enumerate animals (but not people), culture cells and organisms, organs, and teeth. 
Leave a space between numbers and their accompanying units (e.g., 10 mg, not 10mg), and around the = and 
signs.  
Micro-organisms should be referred to in accordance with the International Rules of Nomenclature. When 
applicable, the nomenclature for bacteria presented in Bergey's Manual of Systemic Bacteriology (current 
edition) will be followed. The first reference to an organism by genus and species must be in full (e.g., 
Lactobacillus casei); subsequent mention may abbreviate genus (L. casei). When a common name of a bacterium 
or group is mentioned, do not italicize (e.g., "some lactobacilli" or "sanguis group streptococci"). 
Authors of papers containing primary nucleotide sequencing data are expected to deposit this information in an 
appropriate database (e.g., GenBank/EMBL). Pertinent accession numbers should be provided with the 
submitted manuscript. Published articles will include a footnote indicating the accession number and database in 
which the information was deposited. 
For examples of format not specified here, contributors should consult the Council of Biology Editors Style 
Manual (current edition) and current issues of the Journal. 

The complete names of individual teeth must be given in full in the text of articles (e.g., "permanent upper right 
first premolar"). In Tables, these names may be abbreviated by Viohl's Two-digit System. As approved by the 
International Standards Organization, the first digit indicates the quadrant and the second digit the type of tooth 
within the quadrant. Starting at the upper right side and rotating clockwise, quadrants are assigned the digits 1 to 
4 for the permanent and 5 to 8 for the deciduous teeth; within the same quadrant, teeth from the midline 
backward are assigned the digits 1 to 8 (deciduous teeth, 1 to 5). For example, the permanent lower right first 
molar is designated '46' and the deciduous upper left canine, '63'.

1. GENERAL  
The European Journal of Oral Sciences is an international non-profit journal which publishes original research 
papers within clinical dentistry, on all basic science aspects of structure, chemistry, developmental biology, 
physiology and pathology of relevant tissues, as well as on microbiology, biomaterials, and the behavioral 
sciences as they relate to dentistry. In general, analytical studies with a scientific novelty value are preferred to 
descriptive ones. Reviews, Focus Articles, Short Communications and Letters to the Editor will also be 
considered for publication. 
Please read the instructions below carefully for details on the submission of manuscripts, the journal's 
requirements and standards, as well as information concerning the procedure after a manuscript has been 
accepted for publication in the European Journal of Oral Sciences. Authors are encouraged to visit Blackwell 
Publishing Author Services for further information on the preparation and submission of articles and figures. 
It is expected that all manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should follow journal 
format as described in the Author Guidelines and as displayed in recent issues of the Journal. Failure to do so 
reflects negatively on the work itself and may be a cause for immediate rejection of a manuscript. 

2. ETHICAL GUIDELINES  
The European Journal of Oral Sciences adheres to the below ethical guidelines for publication and research. 

2.1. Authorship and Acknowledgements  
Authors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that the manuscript has been read and approved by all 
authors, and that all authors agree to the submission of the manuscript to the Journal.  
The European Journal of Oral Sciences adheres to the definition of authorship set up by The International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). According to the ICMJE, authorship criteria should be based on 
1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of 
data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the 
version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2 and 3. 
It is a requirement that all authors have been accredited as appropriate upon submission of the manuscript. 
Contributors who do not qualify as authors should be mentioned in the Acknowledgements. 

2.2. Ethical Approvals 
Experimentation involving human subjects will only be published if such research has been conducted in full 
accordance with ethical principles, including the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the 
additional requirements, if any, of the country where the research has been carried out. Manuscripts must be 
accompanied by a statement that the experiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of 
each subject and according to the above mentioned principles.  
Animal experiments should be carried out in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the National Institute 
of Health (NIH) in the USA regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures or with the 
European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and in accordance with local 
laws and regulations. 
All studies using human or animal subjects should include an explicit statement in the Material and Methods 
section that the study has been independently reviewed and approved by an ethical board, identifying the review 
and ethics committee for each study. Editors reserve the right to reject papers if there is doubt as to whether 
appropriate procedures have been used.  

2.3 Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials should be reported using the CONSORT guidelines available at www.consort-statement.org. A 
CONSORT checklist should also be included in the submission material.  



_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  73

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

The European Journal of Oral Sciences encourages authors submitting manuscripts reporting from a clinical trial 
to register the trials in any of the following free public clinical trials registries: www.clinicaltrials.gov/, 
http://clinicaltrails-dev.ifpma.org/, http://isrctn.org/. The clinical trial registration number and name of the trial 
register will then be published with the paper.  

2.4 DNA Sequences and Materials Requests  
If a manuscript describes original nucleotide/amino acid sequence data, these should be submitted to GenBank 
by the authors and the accession numbers included in the manuscript. Authors of papers published in the Journal 
are obliged to honor any reasonable request by qualified investigators for unique propagative materials, such as 
cell lines, hybridomas, DNA clones and antibodies that are described in the paper. 

2.5 Conflict of Interest  
Authors are required to disclose any possible conflict of interest. These include financial issues (for example 
patent, ownership, stock ownership, consultancies, speaker's fee). Author's conflict of interest should be included 
under Acknowledgements. 

2.6 Permissions 
If all or parts of previously published illustrations are used, permission must be obtained from the copyright 
holder concerned. It is the author's responsibility to obtain these in writing and provide copies to the Publishers. 

2.7 Copyright Assignment  
Authors submitting a paper do so on the understanding that no part has been published before, that it is not being 
considered for publication elsewhere, and that it has been read and approved by all the authors. Fragmentation of 
research into 'least publishable units' is strongly discouraged.  
If closely related papers, published or not, might be considered as overlapping or duplicate publications, they 
should be submitted with the original manuscript, and the authors should justify the originality of the newly 
submitted paper. 
The submission of the manuscript by the authors means that the authors automatically agree to assign exclusive 
copyright to Nordisk Odontologisk Forening in its capacity as owner of the journal if and when the manuscript is 
accepted for publication. The work shall not be published elsewhere in any language without the written consent 
of Blackwell Publishing. The articles published in this journal are protected by copyright, which covers 
translation rights and the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute all of the articles printed in the journal. 
Upon acceptance of a paper, authors are required to assign the exclusive licence to publish their paper to the 
European Journal of Oral Sciences. Assignment of the exclusive licence is a condition of publication, and papers 
will not be passed to the publisher for production unless license has been assigned. (Papers subject to 
Government or Crown copyright are exempt from this requirement; however, the form still has to be signed). A 
completed Exclusive License Form must be sent to the address specified on the Form, before any manuscript can 
be published. Authors must send the completed original Exclusive License Form by mail upon receiving notice 
of manuscript acceptance. Do not send the Exclusive License Form at submission.  
For questions concerning copyright, please visit Blackwell Publishing's Copyright FAQ

3. MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

importance that a manuscript is adapted to journal format. 
• Before uploading a manuscript, you must turn off Word's automatic function for tracking of changes in the text. 
The uploaded manuscript should not display any track-changes. 
• Review your submission (in HTML and PDF format) before completing your submission by sending to the 
Journal. Click the "Submit" button when you are finished reviewing. 

3.3. Manuscript Files Accepted  
Manuscripts should be uploaded as Word (.doc) or Rich Text Format (.rft) files (not write-protected). 
Illustrations/Figures should be uploaded separately as TIFF, EPS, GIF, JPEG, PICT or Bitmap files. Do not 
embed illustrations in a .doc file and do not use PowerPoint. However, only high-resolution TIFF or EPS files 
are suitable for printing if the manuscript is accepted for publication. The files will be automatically converted to 
HTML and PDF on upload and will be used for the review process. The text file must contain the entire 
manuscript including title page, abstract page, text, references, tables, and figure legends, but no embedded 
figures. In the text, please reference any figures as "Figure 1", "Figure 2" etc to match the Tag name you choose 
for all individual figure files uploaded. Tables may also be uploaded separately. Manuscripts should be formatted 
as described below. Please note that any manuscripts uploaded as Word 2007 (.docx) will be automatically 
rejected, implying that any .docx file should be saved as .doc before uploading.  

3.4. Suspension of Submission Mid-way in the Submission Process 
You may suspend a submission at any phase before clicking the "Submit" button and save it to make the final 
submission later. The manuscript can then be located under "Unsubmitted Manuscripts" and you can click on 
"Continue Submission" to continue your submission when you choose to.  

3.5. E-mail Confirmation of Submission 
After submission you will receive an e-mail to confirm receipt of your manuscript. If you do not receive the 
confirmation e-mail after 24 hours, please check your e-mail address carefully in the system. If the e-mail 
address is correct please contact your IT department. The error may be caused by some sort of spam filtering on 
your e-mail server. Also, the e-mail should be received if the IT department adds our e-mail server 
(uranus.scholarone.com) to their whitelist.  

3.6. Editorial Processing  
After a first editorial screening, manuscripts will be forwarded to one of the Journal's Editors for further 
scientific evaluation and processing. Thus, queries and comments concerning a specific manuscript should 
primarily be directed to the managing Editor. Manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences
will be reviewed by two or more experts in the field. The European Journal of Oral Sciences uses single blinded 
review. The names of the reviewers will thus not be disclosed to the author submitting a paper. 

3.7. Manuscript Status  
You can access ScholarOne Manuscripts any time to check your "Corresponding Author Center" for the status of 
your manuscript. The Journal will inform you by e-mail once a decision has been made. 

3.8. Submission of Revised Manuscripts  
To upload a revised manuscript, please locate your manuscript under "Manuscripts with Decisions" and click on 
"Submit a Revision". You should be careful not to upload the revised version under a new manuscript number as 
if it were another article. Be sure to use the earlier manuscript number (which will then get an R addendum).

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

Please remember to delete any old files uploaded when you upload your revised manuscript. Do not forget to 
submit an accompanying letter with itemized answers to all questions and remarks made by the reviewers and 
the Editor. 

4. MANUSCRIPT TYPES ACCEPTED  
Original Articles: An original article should comprise a conclusive, full-length scientific investigation. It should 
describe the rationale behind the study, the materials and methods used, and the results obtained. There should 
also be a discussion of the implications of the results as well as a list of literature references cited.  
Scientific studies investigate phenomena and acquire new knowledge - or correct or integrate previous 
knowledge. They are based on the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and subject to 
specific principles of reasoning. The European Journal of Oral Sciences gives priority to analytical articles, 
investigating why and how something occurred rather than reporting empirical observations. 
Review Articles: May be invited by the Editors. Proposals for such articles should be discussed with the 
appropriate Editor prior to preparation and submission. Review articles comprise attempts to synthesize the 
existing literature pertaining to a specific scientific question using methods and principles of reasoning that are 
as transparent as possible. It follows that systematic reviews are preferred over more narrative reviews. Review 
articles will be subjected to peer review. 
Focus Articles: May be invited by the Editors. Proposals for such articles should be discussed with the 
appropriate Editor prior to preparation and submission. Focus articles may build on the same principles as the 
Review article, but are usually shorter and aim at stimulating a broader scientific discussion by 'contesting 
conventional wisdom' and allowing the author(s) to argue a specific point pertaining to a matter of current 
scientific importance. Focus articles will be subjected to peer review. 
Short Communications: Short communications should aim at being no longer than two printed pages. They 
should contain important, new, definitive information of sufficient significance to warrant publication. Short 
communications need not follow the usual division into Material and methods etc. but should have a short 
Abstract. 
Extra issues: Congress proceedings, larger papers or monographs may be published as Supplements or Part II 
issues, the full cost being paid by the congress organizer or similar. A condition is that the proposed extra issue 
is deemed to have a significant scientific value. In some cases, the Journal will partly fund extra issues; this is at 
the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. Further information may be obtained from the Editor-in-Chief.  

5. MANUSCRIPT FORMAT AND STRUCTURE  
It is expected that all manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should follow journal 
format as described in the Author Guidelines and as displayed in recent issues of the Journal. Failure to do so 
reflects negatively on the work itself and may be a cause for immediate revision or even rejection of a 
manuscript. 

5.1. Format  
Language: The language of publication is English. Authors whose native language is not English are strongly 
advised to obtain assistance from someone proficient in scientific English. Manuscripts not submitted in the 
proper format or in poor English may be returned without review. A list of independent suppliers of editing 
services can be found at www.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/english_language.asp. All services are paid for 
and arranged by the author, and use of one of these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for 
publication.  

Abbreviations, Symbols and Nomenclature: Correct unit abbreviations should be used. Examples include ''yr'', 
''wk'', ''d'', ''h'', ''min'', ''s'' and ''µm'' rather than ''years'', ''weeks'', ''days'', ''hrs'', ''minutes'', ''sec'' and ''µ'', 
respectively. For abbreviations of physical and chemical units and symbols, designation of isotopically labelled 
compounds, abbreviations which may be used without definition etc., the Biochemical Journal web site is a 
valuable resource. Scientific names of bacteria, binomials in italics, must be given in full when first mentioned. 
Subsequent mention may abbreviate genus, taking care that this abbreviation is unambiguous (Staph. or Strep. 
instead of S.). 

5.2. Structure  
All manuscripts submitted to the European Journal of Oral Sciences should include: Title page, Abstract Page, 
Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, 
Tables, and Figures, arranged in that order.  
Authors are urged to consult a recent issue of the Journal to be familiar with style and format. The whole 
manuscript should be double-spaced, paginated, and submitted in correct English. The beginning of paragraphs 
should be properly marked with an indent. Avoid end-of-line hyphens.  



_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  76
?

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

Title Page: The title page should contain the following information in the order given: 1) the article title; 2) 
authors' full names without degrees or titles; 3) authors' institutional affiliations including city and country; 4) a 
running title, not exceeding 40 letters and spaces; 5) name, address, telephone, telefax and e-mail address of the 
author responsible for correspondence. The title should be concise but informative, include animal species used 
(if appropriate) and should not include any non-standard acronyms or abbreviations. The Journal does not favour 
titles of an affirmative character. 
Abstract: A separate abstract page should contain the following: 1) authors' surnames and initials; 2) title of 
manuscript; 3) the abbreviation Eur J Oral Sci; 4) the word Abstract followed by a summary of the complete 
manuscript; 5) up to five key words according to Index Medicus; 6) name, address, telefax and e-mail address of 
the author to whom requests for reprints should be sent. This contact information should refer to a professional 
rather than to a residential/private address. 
The Abstract should give a condensed overview of the study, summarizing its background, aim, methodology 
and results with only few but relevant details, and the authors' principal conclusions. It should be short and 
concise, without headings and not divided into paragraphs, and with a maximum of 200 words. It should not 
contain any non-standard acronyms or abbreviations.

5.3 Main Text of Original Articles  
Material and Methods: Procedures should be described in such a detail as to make it possible to repeat the 
work. Subheadings may be used to improve clarity.  
It is assumed that authors have considered the ethical aspects of their research and ensured that the work was 
approved by an appropriate Ethical Committee. This should be stated. In human experimentation, informed 
consent from individuals must have been given. (See above under 2.2) 
Sources of supply of commercial products should be given with the address (town, state and country) in 
parenthesis. 
For an improved quality and transparency, reports of randomized trials must conform to the CONSORT 
guidelines and will be evaluated in light of the recommendations in this statement. (See above under 2.3) 
Since many investigations rely on statistical treatment, authors are advised to consult a person with in-depth 
statistical knowledge. 
If a manuscript describes original nucleotide/amino acid sequence data, these should be submitted to GenBank 
by the authors and the accession numbers included in the manuscript. (See above under 2.4) 
Authors of papers published in the Journal are obliged to honor any reasonable request by qualified investigators 
for unique propagative materials, such as cell lines, hybridomas, DNA clones and antibodies that are described in 
the paper. 
Results and Discussion: The Results section should clearly and concisely report findings, as a rule in the past 
tense, without subjective comments and reference to previous literature. Double documentation of data in text, 
tables or figures is not acceptable. Tables/figures should not include data that can be given in the text in one or 
two sentences. The Discussion section presents the interpretation of the findings; this is the only proper section 
for subjective comments. Authors are strongly urged to avoid undue repetition of what has already been reported 
in Results. For the sake of clarity, the Results section may have subheadings; this is usually not the case with the 
Discussion.  
Acknowledgements: Under acknowledgements please specify contributors to the article other than the authors 
accredited. This may include recognition of e.g. financial support, gifts of research material, assistance with 
statistics and language. Please also include specifications of any potential conflict of interests if appropriate.  
Short Communications need not follow the usual division into Material and methods etc. but should have a 
short abstract. 
Review and Focus Articles should include a Title page, an Abstract page and a Reference list as regular 
Original Research Articles. Although a Review article (particularly following a systematic review) may adhere 
to the format of the Original Research Article, Review and Focus articles need not contain Materials and 
Methods, Results or Discussion sections, and may instead employ other headings as relevant for the topic 
addressed. 

5.4. References 
Number references consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text. Identify references in 
texts, tables, and legends by Arabic numerals (within parenthesis). Check to ensure that all listed references are 
cited in the text. If an author's name is mentioned in the text, small capital letters should be used.
Non-refereed material and, if possible, non-English publications should be avoided. Congress abstracts, 
unaccepted papers, unpublished observations, and personal communications may not be placed in the Reference 
list. References to 'unpublished findings' and to 'personal communication' (provided explicit consent has been 
given by the sources) may be inserted in parentheses in the text. Unpublished articles should be referred to only 



_________________________________________________________________________ Anexos  77

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

if proof can be given that they are accepted for publication. Copies of such articles may be requested for 
evaluation of the manuscript submitted. 
Authors are urged to study the examples of correct reference formats given below. For abbreviations of journals, 
consult the List of the Journals Indexed in Index Medicus. List all authors; do not use et al. in the Reference list. 
Avoid issue numbers in journal articles. Give first and last page of references in full.

5.5. Tables, Figures and Figure Legends 

Tables: Tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals. Each table should include a 
compulsory, concise explanatory title and an explanatory legend. A table should be organized with due regard 
for the proportion of the printed column/page. Specifically, tables which are too wide must be avoided, as these 
have to be printed vertically.  

Figure Legends: Include Figure Legends after the reference section of the Main Text.  

Figures: Articles will not be published unless the Figures fulfill journal quality criteria in terms of scientific 
information, general style, legibility of text and numbers, as well as electronic format and resolution. Double 
documentation of data in text, tables or figures is not acceptable. Always consider whether data might be better 
given in the text or in a table. All graphs, drawings, and photographs are considered Figures and should be 
numbered in sequence with Arabic numerals. Each figure should have a legend (number and list legends after the 
reference section of the main text). Figures should be planned to fit the proportions of the printed page or one 
column's width. Authors are encouraged to arrange micrographs into multipanel montages. Magnifications 
should be indicated by scale bars. Text on photographs should be in capitals. To provide appreciable diagrams, 
lettering should be kept to a minimum and be large enough to sustain reduction in printing. Unnecessary colour, 
grey shades and 3D character should be avoided in graphs.  

Preparation of Electronic Figures for Publication: Print publication requires high quality images to prevent 
the final product being blurred or unclear. Submit EPS (line art), TIFF (halftone/photographs) or PDF (line 
art/photographs) files only. MS PowerPoint and images embedded in MS Word files are not acceptable for 
reproduction. Halftone images in colour or greyscale (TIFF only) should have a resolution of 300 dpi in relation 
to the reproduction size (see below), while line drawings should have a resolution of 600 to 1200 dpi. EPS files 
should be saved with fonts embedded (and with a TIFF preview if possible). For scanned images, the scanning 
resolution (at final image size) should be as follows: line art: &gt;600 dpi; half-tones (including gel photographs): 
&gt;300 dpi; figures containing both halftone and line images: &gt;600 dpi. 
Further information can be obtained at Blackwell Publishing's guidelines for figures:

Permissions: If all or parts of previously published illustrations are used, permission must be obtained from the 
copyright holder concerned. It is the author's responsibility to obtain these in writing and provide copies to the 
Publishers. 

Colour Charges: Any figure submitted in colour will be reviewed and processed with the understanding that it 
will be published in colour. Colour illustrations are printed free of charge if their use contributes significantly to 
the scientific value of the article.  

6. AFTER ACCEPTANCE  
Upon acceptance of a paper for publication, the manuscript will be forwarded to the Production Editor, who is 
responsible for the production of the journal. Please note that an article can not be printed unless all electronic

ANEXO 13: Preparo da mistura de metacrilato para embebição dos dispositivos 

A mistura de metacrilato usada para embebição dos dispositivos é composta de metil 

metacrilato (24,8% volume/volume), butil metacrilato (74,2%, volume/volume) e peróxido de benzoíla 

(1% peso/volume). 

A mistura foi preparada conforme descrito abaixo: 

i. A hidroquinona, presente no metil e butil metacrilato como estabilizador, foi removida por extração 

com água. Para tanto, volumes iguais de metacrilato e NaOH 2,5 M foram colocados em um funil de 

separação, sendo a mistura agitada vigorosamente por 2 minutos e, sem seguida, mantidos em repouso, 

permitindo a separação de fases. A fração inferior (aquosa) foi descartada e o sobrenadante 

(metacrilato), retido. Para ambos metil e butil metacrilato, o procedimento de extração foi realizado 2 

vezes. 

ii. A água foi removida do metil e butil metacrilato, adicionando-se excesso de CaCl2 (anidro) ao 

metacrilato. Com base no produto de solubilidade do CaCl2 anidro a 0 ºC (36,7%), considerou-se 

como excesso 40 g de CaCl2 para cada 100 mL de metacrilato. A suspensão foi agitada vigorosamente 

por 2 minutos. Após armazenamento overnight a -20 ºC, as suspensões foram filtradas 2 vezes (Filtro 

nº1, Whatman, 0,2 µm de poro). Os filtrados resultantes foram decantados em frascos previamente 

secos. Estes reagentes foram armazenados a -20 ºC, até requeridos para uso. 

iii. A mistura de metacrilato foi completada pela adição de peróxido de benzoíla. Após atingirem 

temperatura ambiente, o butil metacrilato e o metil metacrilato foram misturados em uma proporção 

de 75:24. A esta mistura, foi adicionado peróxido de benzoíla, a uma concentração de 1% 

(peso/volume). Esta mistura final foi aquecida até se tornar transparente, armazenada em frascos de 

vidro de 2 mL e então armazenada a -20 ºC até requerida para uso.

próximo da borda, devido à contração de 
polimerização . 

c. Colagem do anel de resina sobre o disco de 
esmalte. O anel de resina é pressionado firmemente 
contra o esmalte para se evitar penetração do 
cianoacrilato no interior do anel. (Cortesia de H. 
Abudiak) 

d.  Vista lateral do dispositivo in situ de Leeds 
após remoção dos excessos. O disco de esmalte 
tem tamanho ligeiramente maior que o anel de 
resina composta. (Cortesia de H. Abudiak)
