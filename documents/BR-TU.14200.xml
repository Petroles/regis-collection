RESUMO 

 

 O envenenamento por animais peçonhentos é considerado uma doença 

ocupacional comum e grave, especialmente em áreas rurais de países tropicais em 

desenvolvimento. Sua importância para a saúde pública tem sido largamente ignorada 

pelas autoridades médicas em todo o mundo. Apesar dos soros antivenenos serem 

produzidos por vários laboratórios distribuídos em todos os continentes, o alto número 

de acidentes, a mortalidade e a morbidade associadas a eles continuam tendo um grande 

impacto sobre a população e os sistemas de saúde desses países. Especificamente nas 

regiões do sul do Brasil, os acidentes com lagartas venenosas da espécie Lonomia 

obliqua têm sido um problema crescente, não somente pelas altas taxas de incidência, 

mas também pela severidade das consequências clínicas observadas nos casos de 

envenenamento. Frequentemente, as vítimas envenenadas apresentam uma síndrome 

hemorrágica grave, que pode evoluir para insuficiência renal aguda (IRA), hemorragia 

intracraniana e morte. O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido com o objetivo de investigar 

os mecanismos fisiopatológicos induzidos pela toxicidade sistêmica do veneno de L. 

obliqua, dando atenção especial às alterações renais e vasculares que são descritas como 

as principais causas de morte neste tipo de envenenamento. Os resultados obtidos são 

aqui apresentados na forma de artigos científicos que abordam os seguintes aspectos: (i) 

o conhecimento atual sobre os componentes moleculares do veneno de L. obliqua e as 

características clínicas do envenenamento; (ii) a caracterização das principais alterações 

histopatológicas, hematológicas, bioquímicas e genotóxicas em diferentes órgãos e a 

capacidade da soroterapia antiveneno em neutralizar os efeitos tóxicos sistêmicos do 

veneno de L. obliqua em um modelo experimental in vivo em ratos; (iii) a 

epidemiologia, a fisiopatologia e o manejo terapêutico da IRA induzida por diferentes 

venenos nefrotóxicos; (iv) os mecanismos envolvidos na IRA induzida pelo 

envenenamento experimental com L. obliqua; e (v) a contribuição dos componentes do 

sistema calicreína-cininas (SCC) para a instabilidade hemodinâmica, a inflamação e o 

consequente comprometimento renal observado no envenenamento experimental com L. 

obliqua. Resumidamente, os dados obtidos permitiram-nos indicar que a injeção 

subcutânea do veneno de L. obliqua em ratos induz alterações hemostáticas severas e 

danos em múltiplos órgãos, principalmente nos pulmões, coração, rins e baço. Há 

também evidências de que o veneno possui atividade cardiotóxica, miotóxica e 

genotóxica. Além disso, o tratamento com soro só é eficaz em neutralizar os efeitos 



16 

 

fisiopatológicos sistêmicos se for administrado durante a fase inicial de envenenamento. 

Em relação ao mecanismo da IRA induzida pelo veneno, este parece ser complexo e 

multifatorial envolvendo três aspectos principais: a citotoxicidade tubular derivada da 

ação do heme; as alterações vasculares, incluindo hipotensão sistêmica, aumento de 

permeabilidade vascular e deposição de fibrina nos capilares glomerulares; e a ativação 

do SCC renal. Em conjunto, estes mecanismos estão diretamente relacionados com as 

alterações funcionais observadas em ratos envenenados, como a hipoperfusão renal, 

inflamação, necrose tubular e a perda súbita das funções básicas do rim, incluindo perda 

da capacidade de filtração e excreção, concentração de urina e manutenção do equilíbrio 

hídrico. As ativações da calicreína renal e do receptor B1 de bradicinina (B1R) 

desempenham papel fundamental na IRA induzida por L. obliqua, pois tanto o bloqueio 

farmacológico do B1R quanto a inibição da calicreína são capazes de prevenir as 

alterações funcionais e histopatológicas renais observadas nos ratos envenenados. Os 

principais mecanismos envolvidos nesses efeitos benéficos estão associados com uma 

diminuição da resposta inflamatória renal (redução da migração de células 

proinflamatórias e dos níveis de citocinas proinflamatórias) e da degeneração tubular. 

Portanto, o conjunto de todos os resultados aqui mostrados permitiram fornecer 

evidências consistentes que relacionam a ativação do SCC e a IRA induzida por L. 

obliqua e também indicar que a inibição de componentes do SCC, principalmente a 

inibição de calicreína ou o antagonismo do B1R, podem ser alternativas terapêuticas 

para o controle da progressão da lesão renal nos casos de envenenamento.

ABSTRACT 

 

 The envenomation by venomous animals is considered a common and serious 

occupational disease, especially in rural areas of tropical developing countries. Its 

public health relevance has been largely ignored by medical authorities worldwide. 

Although antivenoms are produced by various laboratories in every continent, the 

burden of envenomation cases, causing both morbidity and mortality, still has a major 

impact on the population and on health-care systems. Specifically in regions of southern 

Brazil, accidents with the venomous caterpillar Lonomia obliqua have been an emergent 

problem, not only for their high incidence rates, but also by the severity of the clinical 

consequences observed in envenomation cases. Frequently, envenomed victims present 

a severe hemorrhagic syndrome that can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI), 

intracranial hemorrhage and death. Through this work we aimed to investigate the 

physiopathological mechanisms induced by the systemic toxicity of L. obliqua venom, 

with particular attention to renal and vascular disorders that are described as the leading 

cause of death in this type of envenomation. Results are presented here as scientific 

articles that address the following aspects: (i) the current knowledge about the 

molecular components of L. obliqua venom and the clinical features of envenomation; 

(ii) the characterization of the main histopathological, hematological, biochemical and 

genotoxic alterations in different organs and the ability of antivenom serotherapy to 

counteract the systemic toxic effects of L. obliqua venom using an in vivo experimental 

model in rats; (iii) some aspects of epidemiology, physiopathology and management of 

AKI induced by different nephrotoxic venoms; (iv) the mechanisms involved in 

experimental L. obliqua-induced AKI; and (v) the contribution of kallikrein-kinin 

system (KKS) components to the hemodynamic instability, inflammation and the 

consequent renal functional impairment during L. obliqua experimental envenomation. 

In summary, the data indicate that the subcutaneous injection of L. obliqua venom in 

rats induce severe hemostatic abnormalities and multi-organ damage, mainly in the 

lungs, heart, kidneys and spleen. There are also evidences of cardiotoxic, myotoxic and 

genotoxic activities in L. obliqua venom. Moreover, treatment with antivenom is only 

effective at counteracting the systemic physiopathological effects if it is administered 

during the initial phase of envenomation. Regarding the mechanism of venom-induced 

AKI, it seems to be complex and multifactorial involving three main issues: the heme-

derived tubular cytotoxicity; vascular alterations, including systemic hypotension, 



18 

 

increase in vascular permeability and glomerular fibrin deposition; and the activation of 

renal KKS. Acting together these mechanisms are directly related to the functional 

alterations observed in envenomed rats such as renal hypoperfusion, inflammation, 

tubular necrosis and the sudden loss of basic renal functions, including filtration and 

excretion capacities, urinary concentration and maintenance of body fluid homeostasis. 

The activation of renal kallikrein and the bradykinin receptor B1 (B1R) play a crucial 

role in L. obliqua-induced AKI, because both the pharmacological blockade of B1R or 

kallikrein inhibition are able to prevent the renal functional and histopathological 

alterations observed in the kidneys of envenomed rats. The main mechanisms 

underlying these beneficial effects are associated with a decrease in renal inflammatory 

response (reduction of pro-inflammatory cell migration and pro-inflammatory cytokine 

levels) and tubular degeneration. Thus, the set of all findings allowed us to show a 

consistent evidence linking KKS activation with the L. obliqua-induced AKI and 

indicate that the inhibition of KKS components, mainly kallikrein inhibition or B1R 

antagonism, could be a therapeutic alternative to control the progression of renal injury 

in the cases of such envenomation.

APRESENTAÇÃO 

 O fascínio e o interesse pelos venenos animais é milenar. No entanto, somente 

no século XIX a composição dos venenos começou a ser melhor compreendida. 

Importantes contribuições nessa área foram feitas por brasileiros como Vital Brasil, um 

dos grandes responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento da toxinologia em nosso país. Desde 

então, as pesquisas básicas sobre a bioquímica e a farmacologia dos venenos 

contribuíram significativamente para a descoberta de novas substâncias com potencial 

aplicação terapêutica e, também, para o entendimento da fisiopatologia de inúmeras 

doenças. Exemplo clássico é a bradicinina, descoberta por pesquisadores brasileiros 

quando estudavam o mecanismo de ação do veneno de Bothrops jararaca (ROCHA E 

SILVA et al., 1949). Hoje se sabe que essa descoberta conduziu não só a um novo 

campo de investigação científica, mas também à compreensão de diferentes patologias e 

ao desenvolvimento de uma das classes de anti-hipertensivos mais utilizadas no mundo 

inteiro (FERREIRA, 1965; ONDETTI et al., 1971; CUSHMAN et al., 1973).      

 Dentro deste contexto e com a intenção de contribuir para a geração de 

conhecimento em toxinologia, a presente tese de doutorado versa sobre a fisiopatologia 

dos envenenamentos e, em particular, busca caracterizar os mecanismos de toxicidade 

sistêmica e aqueles envolvidos na disfunção renal induzida pelo veneno da taturana 

Lonomia obliqua em modelos de experimentação animal. Os trabalhos aqui 

apresentados fazem parte do projeto intitulado "Os Venenos Animais: do Diagnóstico 

ao Tratamento, da Estrutura ao Mecanismo de Ação das Toxinas", e foram 

desenvolvidos na vigência de auxílio concedido pela Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento 

de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) do Ministério da Educação 

(Toxinologia/Processo 23038.006277/2011-85). Grande parte da etapa experimental foi 

realizada no Laboratório de Bioquímica Farmacológica do Centro de Biotecnologia da 

Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) e no Laboratório de Fisiologia 

Renal do Departamento de Fisiologia e Biofísica da Universidade Federal de Minas 

Gerais (UFMG). Os experimentos com animais seguiram as atribuições e competências 

definidas na Lei 11.794/08 e em resoluções do Conselho Nacional de Controle em 

Experimentação Animal (CONCEA). Os protocolos utilizados foram previamente 

aprovados pela comissão de ética no uso de animais em pesquisa de ambas as 

instituições onde os experimentos foram realizados. 



20 

 

   A tese está dividida em três partes principais: introdução, resultados e 

discussão. A primeira delas é destinada a uma breve revisão acerca dos conhecimentos 

necessários para o entendimento da segunda parte, onde são apresentados os resultados 

obtidos na forma de artigos científicos. Dois desses artigos tratam-se de revisão da 

literatura científica. Um deles versa sobre aspectos tóxico-farmacológicos do veneno da 

taturana e o outro sobre os mecanismos da insuficiência renal aguda induzida por 

veneno de animais peçonhentos. Outros três artigos, contendo dados experimentais, 

também fazem parte da seção de resultados e versam sobre: (i) os mecanismos de 

toxicidade sistêmica no envenenamento por L. obliqua, descrição de novas atividades e 

efeitos do soro antiveneno; (ii) os mecanismos da insuficiência renal aguda induzida por 

L. obliqua; e (iii) a participação do sistema calicreína-cininas na disfunção renal 

induzida pelo veneno. Por fim, na terceira parte da tese, os resultados obtidos são 

melhor explorados e discutidos. Na proposição desta terceira parte, é objetivo auxiliar a 

integração dos resultados e a geração de perspectivas para futuras pesquisas.

1. INTRODUÇÃO 

 

1.1 Os acidentes com animais peçonhentos e sua relevância para a saúde pública 

 

 O envenenamento por animais peçonhentos constitui um importante problema de 

saúde pública em muitas regiões, particularmente em áreas tropicais e subtropicais 

(GUIMARÃES, 2011; GUTIÉRREZ et al., 2006). Considerando somente os acidentes 

com serpentes, estima-se que cerca de 5,4 a 5,5 milhões de pessoas são vitimadas por 

ano no mundo, resultando em 400.000 amputações e entre 20.000 e 125.000 mortes 

(CHIPPAUX, 1998, KASTURIRATNE et al., 2008; WILLIAMS et al., 2010). 

Certamente, esses números são subestimados, pois, além dos problemas de notificação, 

eles não incluem os acidentes com outros animais peçonhentos e venenosos. 

Interessante notar que, apesar dos acidentes não possuírem um potencial epidêmico 

como o de doenças infecciosas ou parasitárias, as taxas de mortalidade chegam a 

superar as de algumas moléstias tropicais reconhecidas pela Organização Mundial da 

Saúde (OMS) como doenças negligenciadas (Tabela 1). Em razão disso, a partir de 

2009, a OMS incluiu os acidentes com animais peçonhentos na lista de doenças 

negligenciadas e, desde então, iniciativas globais de combate ao problema vêm sendo 

estimuladas (GUTIÉRREZ et al., 2013).  

 A ocorrência dos acidentes é particularmente grave para os habitantes de áreas 

rurais que são a parte da população mais atingida devido ao seu ambiente específico de 

trabalho, o que lhes proporciona um contato íntimo de mãos e pés, usualmente 

desprotegidos, contra uma gama bastante variada de espécies de animais, inclusive os 

venenosos (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 1998; GARCIA &amp;amp; DANNI-OLIVEIRA, 2007). 

Vale ressaltar que a população rural desempenha um exaustivo trabalho agrário, o que 

exige saúde e integridade física. Já em 1897, Vital Brazil, atendendo pacientes em 

fazendas no interior de São Paulo, impressionava-se com o número elevado de pacientes 

picados por serpentes venenosas. A partir desta época, buscando desenvolver medicação 

eficaz que pudesse ser aplicada a tais pacientes, Vital Brazil e outros pesquisadores 

deram início aos estudos básicos sobre a bioquímica e a farmacologia dos venenos 

animais, o que acabou gerando o conhecimento científico necessário ao 

desenvolvimento dos soros antivenenos para o tratamento das vítimas (BARRAVIERA, 

1999).

Atualmente, a utilização dos antivenenos produzidos nos Institutos Butantan 

(São Paulo, SP), Vital Brasil (Niterói, RJ) e Fundação Ezequiel Dias (Belo Horizonte, 

MG), vem reduzindo significativamente o número de óbitos ocasionados por acidentes 

com animais peçonhentos. Desde a implantação do Programa Nacional de Controle dos 

Acidentes por Animais Peçonhentos em 1986, todos os soros produzidos no Brasil são 

adquiridos pelo Ministério da Saúde e distribuídos às secretarias estaduais de saúde que, 

por sua vez, definem os pontos estratégicos para atendimento dos acidentados e 

utilização correta e racional dos antivenenos (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 2005). 

Todavia, por falta de um levantamento epidemiológico preciso e problemas de 

distribuição, nem sempre tais produtos estão disponíveis em localidades distantes onde 

mais frequentemente os acidentes ocorrem, sendo, também, ainda muito elevados os 

índices de sequelas decorrentes das lesões geradas por tais envenenamentos (FAN &amp;amp; 

CARDOSO, 1995).  

 Especificamente no Brasil, o Sistema de Vigilância Sanitária do Ministério da 

Saúde estimou a ocorrência de 107.364 acidentes com animais peçonhentos (incluindo 

casos de envenenamento por serpentes, aranhas, escorpiões, abelhas e lagartas) que 

resultaram em 290 mortes somente no ano de 2009 (BOLETIM ELETRÔNICO 

EPIDEMIOLÓGICO, 2010). No mesmo ano, o Centro de Informações Toxicológicas 

do estado do Rio Grande do Sul (CIT/RS) registrou 5.912 acidentes e 5 óbitos

(NICOLELLA et al., 2006-2012). No período de 2008–2012, um total de 28.895 

acidentes foram notificados no Rio Grande do Sul, sendo 34 % destes acidentes 

causados por aranhas, 20 % por lagartas e 16 % por serpentes (Tabela 2). Armadeiras 

(Phoneutria sp.), aranhas-marron (Loxosceles sp.), taturanas (Lonomia sp., Dirphia sp. e 

Hylesia sp. ) e jararacas (Bothrops sp.) foram os principais animais envolvidos.

 O registro de acidentes com lagartas começou a aumentar no Rio Grande do Sul 

a partir de 1989 quando casos de hemorragia sistêmica foram observados em várias 

vítimas que tiveram contato com animais da espécie Lonomia obliqua (Lepidoptera, 

Saturniidae). Na mesma época, vários casos semelhantes também foram registrados em 

Santa Catarina e Paraná (DUARTE et al., 1990). Os acidentes foram particularmente 

preocupantes entre 1989-1995, período que antecedeu o desenvolvimento do soro 

antiveneno específico, quando os níveis de letalidade chegaram a ser de 3 a 6 vezes 

maiores do que os observados em envenenamentos por serpentes (DIAZ, 2005; 

ABELLA et al., 2006). O quadro clínico resultante do contato com L. obliqua é

caracterizado por uma síndrome hemorrágica com a presença de equimoses, hematúria, 

sangramento das mucosas e, em casos graves, hemorragia intracraniana e insuficiência 

renal aguda (PINTO et al., 2010; VEIGA et al., 2009). Nas seções subsequentes, serão 

apresentados detalhes da epidemiologia dos acidentes, fisiopatologia do envenenamento 

e composição do veneno de L. obliqua.

1.2 Os acidentes com a taturana Lonomia obliqua 

 

1.2.1  Dados epidemiológicos 

  

 Os insetos da ordem Lepidóptera compreendem as borboletas (animais de 

hábitos diurnos) e as mariposas (animais de hábitos noturnos), existindo no Brasil cerca 

de 50.000 espécies diferentes. Em seu desenvolvimento, estes insetos passam pelas 

fases de ovo, larva ou lagarta, pupa ou crisálida e adulto, ou seja, apresentam evolução 

completa ou holometabólica (CARDOSO &amp;amp; HADDAD, 2005).  

Quando na fase larval, são conhecidas popularmente por taturanas, bichos-

cabeludos, lagartas-de-fogo, entre outras denominações. Nesta fase, alguns 

Lepidópteros são responsáveis por envenenamentos em humanos, cujos sintomas mais 

comuns são reações cutâneas, urticária, dor e sensação de queimadura no local de 

contato, podendo ocorrer também distúrbios da coagulação sanguínea, hemorragias e 

insuficiência renal aguda (DIAZ, 2005). No Brasil, já na época da colonização, o padre 

Anchieta citou, na “Carta de São Vicente” de 1560, o medo dos índios frente a algumas 

lagartas que causavam tais acidentes, produzindo inúmeras reações e dor intensa após o 

contato físico (ROTBERG, 1971; COSTA, 1994). Esses animais eram chamados de 

“tatá-raná”, nome que em Tupi-Guarani significa “como fogo” ou “semelhante ao 

fogo”; mais tarde este nome originou, na língua portuguesa, a palavra “taturana”. Hoje 

se sabe que poucas das espécies encontradas no Brasil são potencialmente perigosas, 

sendo que apenas as famílias Saturniidae (gêneros Automeris, Dirphia, Hylesia e 

Lonomia), Megalopygidae (gêneros Podalia e Megalopyge) e Arctiidae (especialmente 

a espécie Premolis semirufa) estão envolvidas em acidentes e apresentam, portanto, 

interesse médico e preocupação de saúde pública (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 1998).    

Das diversas espécies existentes no Brasil, apenas duas da família Saturniidae e 

pertencentes ao gênero Lonomia têm chamado atenção devido ao grave quadro de 

síndrome hemorrágica que causam em vítimas que entram em contado com suas cerdas 

urticantes. O primeiro relato de acidente com essas espécies foi realizado pelo médico 

mineiro Zoroastro de Alvarenga em 1912, que descreveu o caso de um agricultor que 

apresentou saliva sanguinolenta e urina de coloração marrom escura durante 5 dias após 

o contato com uma colônia de lagartas (ZANNIN, 2002).  

No período de 1978 a 1982, um estudo retrospectivo cobrindo as regiões do 

sudeste do Amapá ao oeste da Ilha de Marajó indicou a ocorrência de 36 casos de



Introdução 

27 

 

síndrome hemorrágica resultantes do contato com taturanas. Neste relato, a mortalidade 

foi de 38% e as lagartas eram da espécie L. achelous (FRAIHA-NETO et al., 1986; 

1997). A mesma espécie é responsável por acidentes hemorrágicos registrados desde 

1967 na Venezuela (AROCHA-PIÑANGO, 1967). Há, ainda, registros de acidentes 

com este inseto na Guiana Francesa, no Paraguai, no Peru e no Equador (AROCHA-

PIÑANGO et al., 1992). 

A partir de 1989, acidentes semelhantes aos ocorridos no norte do Brasil e na 

Venezuela começaram a ser registrados também nos estados do sul do Brasil. Duarte et 

al. (1990) relatou dois casos atendidos em Passo Fundo (RS) em que as vítimas 

apresentaram, além dos episódios de sangramentos, insuficiência renal aguda, 

complicação essa até então desconhecida. Em Santa Catarina e no Rio Grande do Sul, 

foram identificadas como responsáveis pelos acidentes as lagartas da espécie L. obliqua. 

No período de 1997 a 2012, foram registrados pelo CIT/RS um total de 1.836 acidentes 

com a taturana L. obliqua somente no Rio Grande do Sul (Figura 1). Deste total, 12 

pacientes evoluíram para o óbito, resultando numa taxa de letalidade de 0,65% neste 

período (NICOLELLA et al., 2006-2012; ABELLA et al., 2006).

No Rio Grande do Sul, várias cidades (Figura 2A) têm registrado a ocorrência 

de acidentes ou identificação da presença da taturana. O somatório de dados 

retrospectivos (período de 1997 a 2005) permitiram demonstrar que 317 municípios do 

Estado são área de risco para acidentes com Lonomia, o que representa 64 % do total de 

municípios. Regiões do pampa e litoral são as de menor risco. Os maiores percentuais 

de notificações foram registrados em Passo Fundo, com 9,7 %, e em Bento Gonçalves, 

com 5,4 % dos casos (Figura 2B) (ABELLA et al., 2006).

Percentual do número de acidentes causados por L. obliqua nas principais cidades do RS (1997-2005). 

Fonte: ABELLA et al., 2006.  

  

 Já em Santa Catarina, no período de 1990 a 2001, foram registrados 1.851 

acidentes que resultaram em seis óbitos (ZANNIN, 2002). No Paraná, entre 1989 e 

2001, aconteceram 252 acidentes com o registro de cinco óbitos (taxa de letalidade de 

1,9%) (GARCIA &amp;amp; DANNI-OLIVEIRA, 2007). 

 O perfil de sazonalidade dos acidentes com a lagarta L. obliqua é semelhante ao 

dos acidentes ofídicos. Um número maior de casos ocorre no verão, época em que o 

animal está na fase larval, o que coincide com a atividade agrícola mais intensa e com a 

época de férias, período em que as pessoas estão mais expostas e mantém maior contato 

com o ambiente (DIAZ, 2005). As regiões anatômicas mais frequentemente atingidas no 

contato com Lonomia são os membros superiores (78,1 %), principalmente as mãos, e 

membros inferiores (13,6 %), na sua maioria tornozelo e pé. Cabeça, tronco, dorso e 



Introdução 

29 

 

abdômen representam 8,3 % dos casos. Há predominância do sexo masculino (68 %) 

sobre o feminino (32 %) e os acidentes distribuem-se em todas as faixas etárias com um 

maior número de casos entre os jovens (até 20 anos). Os acidentes na idade adulta são 

principalmente ocorrências ocupacionais (ZANNIN et al., 2003; ABELLA et al., 2006; 

GAMBORGI et al., 2006). 

 

1.2.2  Aspectos morfológicos da lagarta e do sistema de produção de veneno 

   

 A L. obliqua, quando na sua fase larval, possui o corpo com coloração castanho-

claro-esverdeado. Apresenta a região dorsal com uma linha longitudinal contínua 

marrom-escura, marginada de preto em toda a sua extensão. Outras duas faixas 

longitudinais, com manchas claras e levemente amareladas estão dispostas em alguns 

segmentos torácicos. Possuem cerdas esverdeadas em forma de espículas ou “espinhos” 

ramificados e pontiagudos de aspecto arbóreo simetricamente dispostos ao longo do 

dorso (Figura 3A e B). São larvas gregárias que mimetizam o tronco de árvores 

silvestres e frutíferas tais como ipê, cedro, goiabeira, pereira, pessegueiro e ameixeira, 

onde se agrupam durante o dia e, à noite, sobem para as partes mais altas da árvore onde 

se localizam as folhas mais tenras das quais se alimentam (Figura 3C). Habitam matas, 

parques e pomares domésticos (LORINI &amp;amp; CORSEUIL, 2001). Atualmente, acredita-se 

que o desequilíbrio ambiental causado pelo desmatamento e pelo cultivo de 

monoculturas forçaram a adaptação da L. obliqua aos pomares cultivados próximos às 

residências. Além disso, a utilização de agroquímicos nas grandes culturas pode ter 

exterminado inimigos naturais, desequilibrando o controle natural dessa espécie 

(VEIGA et al., 2001).

morfologia externa. C. Colônia de lagartas sobre o tronco de uma árvore. Fotos: CIT/SC. 

 

 A L. obliqua apresenta um ciclo de vida médio de seis meses, desde a postura, 

eclosão dos ovos, fase larval, fase de pupa e animal adulto, incluindo, obrigatoriamente, 

o período do verão (Figura 4). Na fase adulta, há um evidente dimorfismo sexual, no 

qual a mariposa macho apresenta coloração amarelada e a fêmea rosa-pardo. Esta fase 

tem duração de 7 a 10 dias. Após a cópula, a fêmea deposita os ovos nas folhas das 

plantas que servirão de alimento para as lagartas. Os ovos eclodem em 

aproximadamente 17 dias. Esta espécie apresenta seis ínstares larvais cujas diferenças 

são expressas em pequenas modificações estruturais que vão aumentando em 

complexidade a cada ínstar. A fase larval tem duração média de 85 dias, sendo que cada 

ínstar perdura por aproximadamente duas semanas (LORINI, 1997).

Em um estudo detalhado da morfologia da lagarta L. obliqua foi demonstrado 

que não há glândula produtora de veneno no animal e que o tegumento é revestido 

internamente por um epitélio secretor composto externamente por inúmeras 

especializações cuticulares (Figura 5A) (VEIGA et al., 2001). Cada segmento do corpo 

da lagarta apresenta um conjunto de cerdas ou espículas de formato espinhoso, 

denominado scolus (Figura 5B e C). Nos scolus dorsais, as pontas das cerdas são 

diminutas e, nos scolus subdorsais e subespiraculais, apresentam-se com pontas mais 

longas. As cerdas possuem um poro na extremidade que é a abertura de um canal 

interno onde o veneno é armazenado (Figura 5D e 6C). Estas cerdas, por serem 

constituídas de quitina, são de fácil ruptura (Figura 5D), o que acaba facilitando a 

injeção da secreção venenosa da taturana na pele ou mesmo no tecido subcutâneo da 

vítima, causando o envenenamento (VEIGA et al., 2001; 2009).

com vários scoli contendo as espículas. C. Espícula íntegra. D. Espícula 

quebrada na extremidade com canal interno exposto. Fonte: VEIGA et al., 2001. 

 

 O sistema de produção do veneno é formado por um epitélio subjacente ao 

tegumento da lagarta que reveste toda a parte interna das cerdas como uma evaginação 

contínua do corpo (Figura 6). Em certas regiões deste epitélio, as células expandem-se 

e ficam mais cilíndricas do que cúbicas, formando um grupo de células especializadas 

onde se acumulam produtos de secreção contendo o veneno (Figura 6A). Células 

irregulares da base dos scolus e mesmo aquelas que revestem o interior das cerdas 

também possuem atividade secretora intensa (Figura 6B e C). Na região apical dessas 

células, os núcleos ficam evidenciados, a concentração de vesículas de secreção é mais 

alta e um depósito é formado (Figura 6B). Essas vesículas e produtos de secreção 

acumulam-se e são armazenadas no espaço extracelular subcuticular entre a camada 

epitelial e a cutícula (Figura 6B e C). Provavelmente, o veneno é liberado pela quebra 

das cerdas durante o contato físico, quando a lagarta sente-se pressionada contra a pele, 

e os produtos de secreção contendo as toxinas são drenados através do espaço 

subcuticular até o canal interno de onde é injetado (Figura 6C) (VEIGA et al., 2001; 

2009; PINTO et al., 2010).

1.2.3  A síndrome hemorrágica 

 

 O contato com as secreções venenosas de L. obliqua provoca uma reação 

imediata no local, sendo caracterizada por um ardor intenso (dor caracterizada por 

queimação), hiperemia, prurido, edema e bolhas sanguinolentas (Figura 7A), 

manifestações comumente seguidas por sintomas gerais e inespecíficos do 

envenenamento, que podem surgir mais tardiamente como cefaléia holocraniana, mal-



Introdução 

34 

 

estar geral, náuseas e vômitos; com menos frequência relata-se dores abdominais, 

mialgia, hipotermia e hipotensão. O desenvolvimento do quadro hemorrágico mais 

grave se segue com distúrbios de coagulação e sangramentos: gengivorragia (Figura 

7D), equimose (Figura 7B e C), epistaxe, sangramento em feridas recentes ou já 

cicatrizadas, hemorragias intraarticulares, hematêmese, melena, hematúria, sangramento 

pulmonar e hemorragia cerebral (KELEN et al., 1995; MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 

1998). As manifestações clínicas podem agravar-se com hipotensão, choque e 

insuficiência renal, podendo evoluir para o óbito. As principais causas de morte já 

relatadas na literatura envolvem complicações renais e/ou hemorragia intracraniana 

(DUARTE et al., 1990, 1996; KOWACS et al., 2006).

Os dados laboratoriais indicam coagulopatia que se caracteriza pelo 

prolongamento acentuado do tempo de coagulação obtido pelos testes específicos como 

tempo de protrombina (TP), tempo de tromboplastina parcialmente ativada (TTPa) e 

tempo de trombina (TT) (AROCHA-PIÑANGO &amp;amp; GUERRERO, 2003). Verifica-se 

também queda nos níveis plasmáticos de fibrinogênio (Fg) e dos fatores V, XIII, 

precalicreína (PK), plasminogênio (Plg), proteína C (PC) e ?2-antiplasmina (?2AP), 



Introdução 

35 

 

enquanto os níveis do complexo trombina-antitrombina (TAT), do fragmento 1+2 da 

ativação de protrombina (F1+2) e de D-dímeros (D-D) encontram-se elevados (ZANNIN 

et al., 2003). Os níveis dos fatores X, II, vWF e plaquetas estão normais na maioria das 

vítimas de acidentes, excetuando-se a contagem de plaquetas que está 

significativamente diminuída em casos graves de envenenamento (GAMBORGI et al., 

2006). 

O intenso consumo dos fatores de coagulação observado nos pacientes 

envenenados é compatível com o quadro clínico de coagulação intravascular 

disseminada (CIVD). De fato, os elevados níveis de TAT e F1+2 indicam que há geração 

de trombina intravascular por meio da ativação de protrombina. Juntamente com 

componentes do veneno, a trombina formada seria responsável pelo consumo do 

fibrinogênio circulante e pela ativação do sistema de coagulação sanguínea, o que 

também levaria a uma diminuição de outros fatores como V, XIII, PK e à formação de 

fibrina.  

 O sistema fibrinolítico dos pacientes envenenados também parece estar ativado, 

já que os níveis de Plg e ?2AP estão reduzidos na maioria dos casos. Além disso, os 

níveis plasmáticos de D-D estão aumentados, confirmando que há intensa fibrinólise 

durante o envenenamento. Provavelmente, componentes do veneno são capazes de 

ativar direta ou indiretamente o Plg gerando quantidades significativas de plasmina 

intravascular. A plasmina assim formada, juntamente com enzimas fibrin(ogen)olíticas 

do veneno, atuam diretamente sobre a fibrina gerando os D-D. O excesso de plasmina é 

inibida pela serpina ?2AP, o que explica a redução na concentração plasmática desse 

inibidor. 

 Estudos in vivo em ratos ou mesmo in vitro em cultura de células confirmam as 

hipóteses de ativação da coagulação e fibrinólise e os dados indicativos de coagulopatia 

de consumo secundária à CIVD. Animais envenenados experimentalmente apresentam 

tempo de coagulação prolongado, níveis baixos de fibrinogênio circulante e alta 

atividade do tipo trombina e plasmina no plasma (BERGER et al., 2010a). Além disso, 

fibroblastos tratados com veneno apresentam um perfil procoagulante com aumento de 

expressão de fator tecidual (FT) e do ativador de plasminogênio do tipo uroquinase 

(uPA) (PINTO et al., 2008). Concomitante ao prolongamento do tempo de coagulação, 

há uma significante diminuição da função plaquetária em ratos injetados com veneno 

por via subcutânea. Plaquetas de animais envenenados não agregam quando estimuladas 

por ADP, colágeno ou trombina, o que contribui sobremaneira para o quadro 



Introdução 

36 

 

hemorrágico final. Essa hipoagregação plaquetária não está associada com a queda dos 

níveis de fibrinogênio, mas sim com a geração de óxido nítrico (NO) intravascular, que 

é um potente inibidor da agregação plaquetária. De fato, foi confirmado que os níveis de 

NO aumentam no plasma, a expressão da óxido nítrico sintase (NOS) aumenta em 

fibroblastos e células endoteliais envenenadas e as plaquetas de animais envenenados 

previamente tratados com L-NAME (um inibidor da NOS) são capazes de agregar 

normalmente (PINTO et al., 2008; BERGER et al., 2010a; NASCIMENTO-SILVA et 

al., 2013).  

A gravidade da síndrome hemorrágica induzida por Lonomia sp. incentivou o 

desenvolvimento de um soro eficaz em neutralizar a ação do veneno. Disponível desde 

1996, o soro antilonômico é produzido no Instituto Butantan a partir da imunização de 

eqüínos com o extrato bruto de espículas da lagarta (DIAS DA SILVA et al., 1996; 

ROCHA-CAMPOS et al., 2001). A correta utilização do soro antilonômico é capaz de 

solucionar ou reduzir a gravidade do quadro hemorrágico, sendo a terapia de escolha em 

casos de envenenamento pela taturana. O esquema de tratamento segue recomendação 

do Ministério da Saúde que indica a dose de soro antilonômico levando em 

consideração se o envenenamento é leve, moderado ou grave. Pacientes com 

envenenamento leve são aqueles que apresentam apenas manifestação de dor ou 

sensação de queimação no local do contato e sem alteração de coagulação ou 

sangramento até 72 horas após o acidente. Em geral, esses pacientes recebem apenas 

tratamento sintomático com analgésicos, evitando-se os salicilatos. Os casos de 

envenenamento moderado apresentam alterações de coagulação ou manifestações 

hemorrágicas (gengivorragia, equimose, hematoma ou hematúria), mas sem alterações 

hemodinâmicas (hipotensão, taquicardia ou choque) ou evidência de comprometimento 

renal. Esses pacientes recebem tratamento sintomático para dor e 5 ampolas de soro 

antilonômico via intravenosa (10 mL/ampola, sendo que cada ampola é capaz de 

neutralizar 3,5 mg do veneno). Pacientes graves são aqueles com alterações de 

coagulação, manifestações hemorrágicas em vísceras (hematêmese, hematúria, 

hipermenorragia, hemorragia pulmonar ou intracraniana) ou instabilidade 

hemodinâmica ou lesão renal. Para esses pacientes é recomendado além do tratamento 

sintomático e de suporte, 10 ampolas de soro antilonômico (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 

1998; CAOVILLA &amp;amp; BARROS, 2004). A administração de drogas anticoagulantes ou 

do ácido ?-aminocapróico (inibidor da fibrinólise) isoladamente ou em associação com 

a soroterapia não é recomendada, devido ao risco de se exacerbar o quadro hemorrágico

ou trombótico, conforme já demonstrado em modelos animais (GONÇALVES et al., 

2007). A infusão de sangue total ou plasma fresco para corrigir os níveis dos fatores de 

coagulação também é contraindicada, pois pode acentuar a coagulopatia de consumo. 

Apesar da eficácia, ainda permanece como desafio a produção do soro em quantidade 

suficiente para atender à crescente demanda devido ao aumento dos acidentes e a 

necessidade de disponibilizar o produto em tempo hábil para o tratamento em locais 

distantes onde os acidentes vêm ocorrendo com mais frequência.  

 

1.2.4  Composição bioquímica do veneno  

 

O veneno da lagarta L. obliqua é constituído por princípios ativos na sua maioria 

de natureza proteica ou peptídica com diferentes atividades tóxicas. Dados obtidos a 

partir de uma biblioteca de cDNA das cerdas da lagarta permitiram indicar que, do 

grupo de sequências expressas, cerca de 25 % codificam proteínas homólogas à serino-

proteinases. Outros grupos de sequências codificam proteínas com homologia à 

lipocalinas (15 %), lectinas (15 %), serpinas 15 %), cisteíno-proteinases (10 %), 

inibidores do tipo Kazal (10 %), fosfolipases A2 (5 %) e cininogênios (5%) (VEIGA et 

al., 2005, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/omes/). A análise do extrato das cerdas 

por espectrometria de massas também permitiu identificar serino-proteinases, 

lipocalinas e inibidores de proteases como proteínas majoritárias na secreção venenosa 

(RICCI-SILVA et al., 2008). De fato, algumas toxinas pertencentes a essas e a outras 

classes vêm sendo isoladas com o objetivo de entender a contribuição de cada 

componente para o quadro clínico do envenenamento. Na Tabela 3 estão listadas as 

toxinas isoladas do veneno até o momento; um breve comentário sobre o que se sabe a 

respeito do papel de cada uma para o envenenamento é apresentado a seguir. Maiores 

detalhes podem ser encontrados no primeiro artigo apresentado na seção “Resultados”.   

 

Ativadores de protrombina. Uma das primeiras atividades caracterizadas no veneno de 

L. obliqua foi o efeito procoagulante (DONATO et al., 1998). O extrato das espículas 

da lagarta possui alta atividade proteolítica e é capaz de reduzir significativamente o 

tempo normal de coagulação do plasma pela ativação direta de protrombina e fator X 

(VEIGA et al., 2003; PINTO et al., 2006). Um desses componentes capaz de promover 

a ativação de protrombina foi isolado e denominado LOPAP ("Lonomia obliqua 

prothrombin activator protease") (REIS et al., 2001a). A LOPAP nativa é descrita 



Introdução 

38 

 

como sendo uma lipocalina tetramérica de massa molecular igual a 69 kDa e não possui 

homologia de sequência com qualquer outro ativador já identificado em venenos. Tanto 

a LOPAP nativa (69 kDa) quanto a recombinante monomérica (20 kDa) são capazes de 

gerar trombina a partir de protrombina de maneira dose-dependente na presença de íons 

cálcio e reduzem o tempo de coagulação do plasma (REIS et al., 2006). A atividade 

ativadora de protrombina é completamente abolida na presença de inibidores clássicos 

de serino-proteinases. Segundo esses autores, o mecanismo de ativação da protrombina 

pela LOPAP é semelhante ao do fator Xa do plasma, clivando a protrombina para 

formar pretrombina 2 e não mesotrombina como outros ativadores de veneno de 

serpentes que são tipicamente metaloproteinases (REIS et al., 2001a; REIS et al., 2006). 

Quando injetado por via intravenosa em ratos, a LOPAP reproduz o quadro de 

coagulopatia de consumo observado nos pacientes envenenados. Os animais apresentam 

incoagulabilidade sanguínea, baixos níveis de fibrinogênio, trombocitopenia, e 

depósitos de fibrina nos capilares glomerulares e pulmonares (REIS et al., 2001b). Em 

células endoteliais tratadas com o ativador de protrombina há aumento na produção de 

NO e de prostaciclinas (PGI2) e aumento na expressão de interleucina-8 (IL-8), o que 

sugere que a LOPAP pode estar envolvida na modulação do processo inflamatório 

durante o envenenamento (FRITZEN et al., 2005). 

 

Ativadores de fator X. Outra toxina pró-coagulante, atuando como ativador de fator X, 

também foi isolada a partir do extrato de espículas da taturana. LOSAC ("Lonomia 

obliqua stuart-factor activator") é uma serino-proteinase de cadeia polipeptídica única 

com massa molecular de 45 kDa. A enzima purificada é capaz de ativar o fator X de 

maneira dose-dependente na ausência de íons cálcio, tem ação pró-coagulante no 

plasma e induz produção de NO e aumento de expressão do ativador de plasminogênio 

tecidual (t-PA) em células endoteliais (ALVAREZ-FLORES et al., 2006). Seus efeitos 

in vivo são desconhecidos até o momento. 

 

Fibrinogenases. Além da ação procoagulante, o veneno de L. obliqua também possui 

atividade fibrinolítica, sendo capaz de degradar diretamente fibrinogênio e fibrina 

(PINTO et al., 2006). A enzima responsável por essa atividade é uma serino-proteinase 

de 35 kDa denominada lonofibrase. A lonofibrase degrada as cadeias ??e ??do 

fibrinogênio, mostrando uma maior especificidade para a cadeia ?. A enzima inibe a 

coagulação do fibrinogênio induzida pela trombina e também possui potente atividade 



Introdução 

39 

 

sobre fibrina, apresentando um padrão de degradação diferente do obtido para plasmina, 

o que sugere que esta fibrinogenase apresenta mecanismo de ação diferenciado e pode 

potencializar o quadro de ativação do sistema fibrinolítico observado durante o 

envenenamento (PINTO et al., 2004). 

 

Fosfolipases A2. As fosfolipases estão presentes em praticamente todos os venenos 

animais. As fosfolipases A2 hidrolisam fosfolipídeos gerando ácidos graxos livres e 

lisofosfolipídeos, podendo, assim, causar hemólise indireta. Também podem interferir 

diretamente no processo de coagulação sanguínea e agregação plaquetária (KINI, 2003). 

Seibert et al. (2003) encontraram uma atividade hemolítica no extrato de espículas da L. 

obliqua. Segundo estes autores, o veneno foi capaz de induzir hemólise direta e indireta 

em eritrócitos humanos e de ratos. Além disso, a injeção do extrato de espículas por via 

subcutânea em ratos leva a uma redução importante da contagem de eritrócitos, 

aumento dos níveis plasmáticos de hemoglobina e diminuição de haptoglobina 

(SEIBERT et al., 2004). Casos de hemólise intravascular também já foram observados 

em pacientes envenenados (MALAQUE et al., 2006). Sabe-se que uma fosfolipase A2 

isolada do veneno contribui para esse efeito hemolítico. A enzima possui massa 

molecular de 15 kDa e homologia de sequência de aminoácidos com fosfolipases A2 

encontradas em veneno de abelhas. A enzima purificada tem atividade hemolítica 

indireta e também causa hemólise intravascular em ratos (SEIBERT et al., 2006). 

Adicionalmente, o veneno possui uma atividade tipo fosfolipase A2 capaz de induzir 

adesão e agregação plaquetária in vitro (BERGER et al., 2010b). No entanto, a 

identidade da molécula responsável por esse efeito ainda permanece desconhecida.  

 

Hialuronidases. As hialuronidases são enzimas bem caracterizadas nos venenos de 

serpentes, aranhas, abelhas e escorpiões. Atuam in vivo, degradando componentes da 

matriz extracelular dos tecidos e da parede dos vasos sanguíneos. Dessa forma, estas 

enzimas agem aumentando a distribuição de outras toxinas para os demais tecidos e 

órgãos, favorecendo as manifestações sistêmicas dos envenenamentos (SAMPAIO et 

al., 1991; MARKOVI-HOUSLEY et al., 2000; KUDO &amp;amp; TU, 2001; DA SILVA et al., 

2004).  Especificamente no veneno de L. obliqua foram identificadas duas 

hialuronidases de 53 e 49 kDa, chamadas lonogliases. As enzimas são capazes de 

hidrolisar ácido hialurônico e sulfato de condroitina, sendo caracterizadas como ?-

endohexosaminidases. Estudos utilizando pele de coelhos demonstraram que as 



Introdução 

40 

 

lonogliases são capazes de hidrolisar o ácido hialurônico presente na matriz 

extracelular, o que facilita a penetração das toxinas na derme (GOUVEIA et al., 2005).

1.3 Insuficiência renal aguda nos envenenamentos por animais peçonhentos 

 

A insuficiência renal aguda (IRA) representa uma das principais complicações 

clínicas dos acidentes com animais peçonhentos. Os venenos de serpentes são, em sua 

maioria, altamente nefrotóxicos, porém casos mais graves e frequentes são observados 

em acidentes com serpentes asiáticas e africanas tais como Daboia russelli siamensis 

("Russell's viper"), Echis carinatus ("Saw-scaled viper") e Bitis arietans ("Puff Adder"); 

e também com serpentes da América do Sul como as do gênero Bothrops (jararacas) e 

Crotalus (cascavéis) (RODRIGUES-SGRIGNOLLI et al., 2011; PINHO et al., 2008; 

SITPRIJA, 2006). Além das serpentes, aranhas do gênero Loxsosceles (aranha-marron) 

e as abelhas africanizadas (Apis mellifera) são responsáveis por parcela significativa dos 

casos de IRA, principalmente no Brasil (ABDULKADER et al., 2008). De maneira 

geral, as principais alterações renais descritas são necrose tubular aguda, redução do 

ritmo de filtração glomerular e oligúria. O mecanismo envolvido vem sendo alvo de 

intensa investigação e, ao que tudo indica, é multifatorial. Diferentes modelos 

experimentais indicam que pode haver tanto uma ação citotóxica direta do veneno sobre 

diferentes estruturas renais (como é o caso da toxina dermonecrótica de Loxsosceles que 

se liga especificamente em células tubulares, induzindo alterações estruturais e morte 

celular), quanto uma resposta inflamatória secundária desencadeada em resposta ao 

envenenamento, que leva à liberação de citocinas e espécies reativas de oxigênio 

(BERGER et al., 2012; PINHO et al., 2008; CHAIM et al., 2006). Há também uma 

contribuição importante decorrente da liberação de mioglobina e hemoglobina muito 

comum nos envenenamentos por Crotalus e A. mellifera (GRISOTTO et al., 2006; 

PINHO et al., 2005).  

As complicações renais também são frequentes e usualmente graves nos 

envenenamentos por L. obliqua. Durante a década de 80, dados retrospectivos de 

acidentes ocorridos em Santa Catarina apontaram uma incidência de IRA de 18 %, 

sendo que a taxa de mortalidade chegou a 50 % entre os pacientes que desenvolveram 

IRA após o contato com a lagarta (DUARTE et al., 1990; 1994). Em Passo Fundo (RS), 

de 134 vítimas de envenenamento atendidas no período de 1989 a 1998, 6 % 

desenvolveram IRA, dentre os quais 25 % foram à óbito devido ao dano renal 

(WALTER, 1999). Em outro estudo retrospectivo pelo qual foram analisados 2.067 

pacientes envenenados também em Santa Catarina no período de 1989 até 2003, um 

total de 39 pacientes (1,9 %) desenvolveram IRA (GAMBORGI et al., 2006). Dos 



Introdução 

43 

 

pacientes com IRA, cerca de 32 % (11) necessitaram de hemodiálise e 10,3 % (4) dos 

casos evoluíram para insuficiência renal crônica (IRC). Sete óbitos foram registrados 

nesse período devido às complicações renais. O uso do soro antilonômico a partir de 

1995 não diminuiu a incidência de IRA (que permaneceu em torno de 2 % entre 1995-

2003), mas diminuiu a gravidade dos casos e o número de pacientes que evoluíram para 

IRC. Os pacientes com IRA também apresentaram concomitantemente alterações 

hemorrágicas. Tempo de coagulação prolongado (10 a 30 minutos) foi detectado em 18 

% e incoagulável (maior que 30 minutos) em 83 % dos pacientes com IRA. A contagem 

de plaquetas, hematócrito e hemoglobina também foram menores nesses pacientes 

(GAMBORGI et al., 2006).  

Outra característica clássica do envenenamento por L. obliqua e estreitamente 

relacionada ao desenvolvimento de IRA é a hematúria. A maioria dos estudos 

retrospectivos e relatos clínicos descrevem que 80 a 87 % dos pacientes com IRA 

apresentam hematúria macroscópica (Figura 8A) (GAMBORGI et al., 2006; 

MALAQUE et al., 2006; WALTER, 1999; BURDMANN et al., 1996). O mesmo é 

observado em ratos injetados com o extrato de espículas da lagarta (Figura 8B). Por 

exame direto do sedimento urinário é possível visualizar hemácias intactas e leucócitos 

(Figura 8C).

Introdução 

44 

 

O mecanismo da IRA induzida por L. obliqua e mesmo as alterações patológicas 

renais decorrentes do envenenamento são pouco conhecidas. Não existe qualquer estudo 

de investigação experimental e há apenas dois casos relatados na literatura em que foi 

realizada biópsia renal para exame de alterações histopatológicas. Em um deles, 

Burdmann et al. (1996) descreveram o caso de uma paciente com 67 anos que 

apresentou IRA do tipo anúrica após contato com inúmeras lagartas. A paciente foi 

submetida à biópsia renal depois de 17 dias do acidente e apresentou glomérulos de 

aparência normal, apesar de um espessamento da parede da cápsula de Bowman e 

atrofia tubular focal. Foi mantida em hemodiálise por 26 dias e recuperou a função 

renal. No outro relato é descrito o caso de uma paciente de 37 anos, grávida de 37 

semanas, que teve contato com a palma da mão direita com aproximadamente 15 

lagartas e apresentou gengivorragia, anúria e sangramento genital após 24 horas do 

contato. Devido ao descolamento precoce de placenta, o parto foi realizado e a paciente 

deu à luz a uma criança saudável. Os níveis de creatinina plasmática da paciente 

aumentaram de 4 mg/dL no 1
o
 dia após o acidente para 10,1 mg/dL no 4

o
 dia. Os níveis 

de ureia aumentaram de 41 mg/dL para 169 mg/dL no mesmo período. O tratamento por 

hemodiálise foi iniciado no 5
o
 dia e os níveis de creatinina diminuíram para 3,8 mg/dL 

no 36
o
 dia. Apenas no 27

o
 dia (quando o quadro hemorrágico já havia sido revertido) 

uma biópsia renal foi realizada e se evidenciou a presença de necrose tubular aguda em 

regeneração (FAN et al., 1998). Certamente, a impossibilidade de se fazer biópsia 

precoce, em função dos distúrbios de coagulação inerentes ao acidente, tem dificultado 

uma análise mais adequada das alterações anatomopatológicas renais. Portanto, este fato 

por si só e a gravidade dos casos de IRA justificam a importância do uso de modelos 

animais experimentais para o estudo dos mecanismos fisiopatológicos renais durante o 

envenenamento, o que também pode gerar conhecimento para o desenvolvimento de 

formas alternativas de tratamento.

1.4 O sistema calicreína-cininas 

 

 O sistema calicreína-cininas (SCC) é composto por enzimas e peptídeos 

biologicamente ativos que participam de diferentes processos fisiopatológicos. Além de 

estar envolvido na regulação direta de sistemas endógenos, o SCC está intimamente 

relacionado com vários mecanismos plasmáticos de ativação enzimática por proteólise 

limitada como coagulação sanguínea, fibrinólise, sistema renina-angiotensina e sistema 

complemento (MOVAT, 1979). 

 O mecanismo básico de funcionamento do SCC consiste na ativação da 

precalicreína (uma serinoprotease que pode ser encontrada sob duas formas: calicreína 

plasmática e tissular) que age sobre moléculas do precursor cininogênio gerando 

peptídeos genericamente conhecidos como cininas. A precalicreína pode ser ativada 

enzimaticamente pela ação de proteases como o fator XIIa e a tripsina (SHARIAT-

MADAR et al., 2002). Após ativação, a calicreína plasmática (que é sintetizada no 

fígado) age sobre o cininogênio de alto peso molecular (HMWK, do inglês, high 

molecular weight kininogen; 114 kDa), que circula conjugado a ela, gerando o 

nonapeptídeo ativo, a bradicinina (BK, do inglês, bradykinin; Arg

). Já a calicreína tissular diferencia-se da plasmática quanto às 

características moleculares, físico-químicas e enzimáticas, e hidrolisa preferencialmente 

o cininogênio de baixo peso molecular (LMWK, do inglês, low molecular weight 

kininogen; 68 kDa) gerando calidina (Lys-BK) (PIERCE &amp;amp; GUIMARÃES, 1976; 

SCHMAIER et al., 1999). A calicreína tissular é sintetizada e presente em órgãos como 

glândulas salivares, rins e pâncreas, e secretada em fluidos biológicos (urina, saliva e 

suor). No rim, a Lys-BK pode ser convertida à BK por aminopeptidases presentes no 

plasma e urina ou a BK é liberada diretamente pela calicreína renal (GUIMARÃES et 

al., 1973; 1976; VIEIRA et al., 1994). Além da BK e da calidina, diversas outras 

cininas existem como a T-cinina (Ile-Ser-BK), descrita pela primeira vez no plasma de 

ratos tratados com tripsina (OKAMOTO &amp;amp; GREENBAUM, 1983), e a des-Arg
9
-BK, 

que atua exclusivamente em receptores B1 (ERDÖS, 1979).  

 As cininas possuem um tempo de meia-vida muito curto no organismo, sendo 

inferior a um minuto, pois logo após serem liberadas elas sofrem rápida inativação pela 

ação de enzimas conhecidas como cininases (FERREIRA &amp;amp; VANE, 1987). As 

cininases são metaloproteases zinco-dependentes encontradas nos tecidos e no plasma. 

Em estados não patológicos, são descritas sete metaloproteases responsáveis pela 



Introdução 

46 

 

clivagem de cininas em mamíferos: a mais conhecida é a enzima conversora de 

angiotensina (ECA) ou cininase II (uma dipeptidil-peptidase), a qual cliva entre os 

resíduos Pro
7
-Phe

8 
e logo após entre Phe

5
-Ser

6
. Contudo, carboxipeptidases (M e N), 

conhecidas como cininases do tipo I; aminopeptidases e endopeptidases (como a 

prolilendopeptidase) também estão envolvidas no metabolismo das cininas (ERDÖS, 

1979).  

 As cininas exercem seus efeitos biológicos por meio do estímulo de, pelo menos, 

dois tipos de receptores transmembrana acoplados à proteína G, denominados 

receptores B1 (B1R) e B2 (B2R). BK e Lys-BK exercem a maioria de seus efeitos via 

B2R. Já a des-Arg
9
-BK e a Lys-des-Arg

9
-BK atuam preferencialmente por ligação ao 

B1R (REGOLI &amp;amp; BARABÉ, 1980). O B2R é constitutivamente expresso em diferentes 

tecidos e o B1R é normalmente ausente em tecidos não-traumatizados, tendo sua 

expressão induzida em condições específicas de estresse, lesão tissular, infecção ou 

inflamação (PESQUERO et al., 1996; CALIXTO et al., 2000). De fato, citocinas 

proinflamatórias como a interleucina-1? (IL-1?) e o fator de necrose tumoral-? (TNF-?) 

são capazes de regular a expressão do B1R através do fator de transcrição NF-?B 

(MEDEIROS et al., 2001; 2004; CALIXTO et al., 2004). Ao se ligarem a seus 

receptores, as cininas desencadeiam uma série de eventos intracelulares como 

mobilização de cálcio, ativação das fosfolipases A e C, produção de NO e prostaciclina 

(BHOOLA, 1992). A liberação de NO e prostaciclina leva a uma série de efeitos 

fisiológicos tais como vasodilatação periférica e aumento do fluxo sanguíneo, 

extravasamento vascular, quimiotaxia e ativação de mastócitos e macrófagos, contração 

da musculatura lisa visceral, liberação de autacóides e prostanóides, nocicepção 

(CALIXTO et al., 2000) e de modo antagônico hipotensão sistêmica (ALVING et al., 

1978) e hipertensão portal hepática (BORGES et al., 1976).  

 Diferentes toxinas presentes em venenos animais podem interferir com o 

funcionamento normal do SCC. Entre elas, destacam-se as enzimas semelhantes à 

calicreína, as cininogenases, as cininases, os potenciadores de cininas e os peptídeos que 

possuem efeitos biológicos semelhantes às cininas. Além disso, existem venenos com a 

capacidade peculiar de ativar o SCC mesmo sem apresentar qualquer enzima 

semelhante à calicreína, após desnaturação proteica (HAMBERG &amp;amp; ROCHA E SILVA, 

1957) ou, mesmo, que podem ativar o SCC sem ter atividade proteolítica importante 

(DEUTSCH &amp;amp; DINIZ, 1955). No caso da lagarta L. obliqua, foi demonstrado que o 

veneno é capaz de induzir ativação de precalicreína plasmática apesar de ser desprovido 



Introdução 

47 

 

de significante atividade do tipo calicreína (BOHRER et al., 2007). O mecanismo de 

ação permanece não esclarecido apesar depoder haver participação de mediadores 

liberados por células inflamatórias, visto a importante liberação de histamina mediada 

pelo veneno (DE CASTRO BASTOS et al., 2004), de proteases pulmonares e de células 

endoteliais ativadas, e de moléculas de membrana basal, tipo colágeno, expostas em 

lesões vasculares. O veneno da taturana também possui atividade cininogenásica, sendo 

capaz de liberar BK a partir do LMWK. Quando injetado por via intravenosa, o extrato 

de espículas da lagarta (3 ?g/kg) é capaz de induzir queda na pressão arterial média de 

ratos. O efeito observado é comparável ao produzido pela BK. A administração de 

aprotinina (um inibidor de calicreína plasmática) ou HOE-140 (um antagonista de B2R) 

previne a atividade hipotensora do veneno. Esses dados indicam que o efeito observado 

é dependente da ação da calicreína plasmática e mediado diretamente pela BK 

(BOHRER et al., 2007). Da mesma forma, a ação edematogênica do veneno é inibida 

por aprotinina, HOE-140 e loratadina (um antagonista de receptor H1 de histamina), o 

que demonstra a importância da ativação do SCC para as diferentes alterações 

fisiopatológicas que ocorrem durante o envenenamento (DE CASTRO BASTOS et al., 

2004; BOHRER et al., 2007). 

 Neste trabalho, levantamos a hipótese de que a ativação do SCC induzida pelo 

veneno de L. obliqua também está envolvida na disfunção renal descrita nos pacientes 

envenenados. Há três evidências principais que sustentam essa hipótese: (i) Todos os 

componentes do SCC são expressos no rim; (ii) o SCC participa do controle 

hemodinâmico, regulação da filtração glomerular e do equilíbrio hidro-eletrolítico e (iii) 

componentes do SCC estão envolvidos em diferentes patologias, incluindo a nefropatia 

diabética, a lesão renal por isquemia-reperfusão, a glomerulonefrite e a fibrose renal 

(KAKOKI et al., 2004; WANG et al., 2008; KLEIN et al., 2009; KLEIN et al., 2010).

 Apesar do conhecimento adquirido até o momento sobre as toxinas e as 

disfunções hemostáticas, pouco se sabe sobre os mecanismos de toxicidade sistêmica no 

envenenamento pela taturana L. obliqua. Portanto, o presente trabalho foi desenvolvido 

com o objetivo geral de investigar as alterações fisiopatológicas induzidas pelo veneno 

em diferentes órgãos, dando particular atenção aos distúrbios renais e vasculares que 

são descritos como a principal causa de óbito neste tipo de envenenamento. 

  

 Para tanto, os objetivos específicos propostos foram: 

 

? Caracterizar as principais alterações histopatológicas, hematológicas, 

bioquímicas e genotóxicas sistêmicas induzidas pelo veneno em diferentes 

órgãos utilizando um modelo experimental in vivo em ratos; 

 

? Avaliar a capacidade do soro antiveneno (soro antilonômico) em neutralizar os 

principais efeitos tóxicos sistêmicos in vivo; 

 

? Investigar os mecanismos envolvidos na disfunção renal induzida pelo veneno: 

Avaliar a função glomerular, tubular, equilíbrio hidroeletrolítico, hemodinâmica  

e as alterações histopatológicas renais de ratos experimentalmente envenenados 

por L. obliqua; 

 

? Analisar a expressão diferencial de proteínas no rim de animais envenenados 

buscando identificar marcadores e vias de sinalização associadas à lesão renal; 

 

? Avaliar os níveis de expressão dos componentes do sistema calicreína-cininas no 

rim durante o envenenamento; 

 

? Investigar a contribuição de componentes do sistema calicreína-cininas para a 

lesão renal induzida pelo veneno.

Caterpillar envenomation has been an emergent health issue. Lonomia obliqua is a medi-
cally important animal that causes a hemorrhagic syndrome that can progress to acute
renal failure, intracranial hemorrhage and death. In the past few years the molecular
characterization of L. obliqua venom in addition to experimental models has provided
fundamental information to the understanding of the envenomation syndrome. Herein
studies from several authors which characterized the complex toxic-pharmacological
actions of whole venom are reviewed.

1. Introduction

Accidental contact with some lepidopteran caterpillars
can inflict serious human injuries ranging from simple skin
irritation to serious burns, allergic reactions, renal failure and
hemorrhagic disturbances (Diaz, 2005). Like other venomous
animals, such as snakes and spiders, these caterpillars
produce a variety of toxic components that affect the vascular
system, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet function
(Arocha-Pin?ango et al., 2000). However, different from snakes
and spiders, that use their venoms to immobilize and digest
the prey, the caterpillar venomous components are useful for
defense against predators.

From the medically important Saturniidae family,
Lonomia genus has been attributed to cause human enve-
nomations since late 1960s in Venezuela (Arocha-Pin?ango
and Larysse, 1969). In Southern Brazil, Lonomia obliqua
(Fig. 1a) caterpillar is becoming the most important

venomous animal responsible for severe injuries, hemor-
rhagic disorders and often fatal outcome since the 1980s
(Duarte et al., 1990). For instance, in the State of Rio Grande
do Sul, located in this Brazilian region, more than a thou-
sand accidents have been registered in the 1997 to 2005
period (Abella et al., 2006). In fact, based in the data for the
year 2008, the Brazilian Ministry of Health registered an
incidence of 8 lepidopteran envenomations per 100,000
inhabitants in Southern Brazil (SVS, 2009). Actually, this
numbers are greatly underestimated due to the fact that
most accidents are occurring in distant rural areas, where
the cases are poorly reported. The emergent importance of
L. obliqua accidents seems to be consequence to the
extensive deforestation of rural areas and replacement of
the native forest by fruit tree plantation, a rich source of
food for this lepidopteran. The L. obliqua has gregarious
habits, and this characteristic complicate the patient
prognosis, since the accidents usually involve the contact of
the victim with a caterpillar colony containing dozens or
hundreds of caterpillars lying on the surface of tree trunks.

L. obliqua is venomous only in the larval stages (1st to
6th instars), when the body of the insect is covered by

chitinous bristles (Fig. 1b). These structures are hard and
spiny evaginations of the cuticle underneath. Contrarily to
other venomous animals, there is no specialized venomous
gland in L. obliqua and the venom is produced by a secre-
tory epithelium localized under the cuticle (Veiga et al.,
2001). The bristles have a hollow canal by which the
venom is injected in the victim. The accident occurs when
the whole animal is crushed by the victim; the insect’s
chitinous bristles are broken and the venomous secretions
penetrate the human skin reaching blood circulation (Veiga
et al., 2001).

In this review, we focused in studies that provided
significant contributions to the comprehension of the bio-
logical effects of the whole venom in experimental models.
In fact, these reports are responsible for identification and
characterization of venom mechanisms capable of repro-
ducing some of the main physiopathological aspects of the
clinical envenomation.
2. Clinical aspects of human envenomation

Clinical symptoms of L. obliqua envenomation include
local pain and inflammatory reaction, which starts imme-
diately after contact; systemic reactions such as headache,
fever, vomiting and asthenia, which appear a few hours after
exposure; and bleeding diathesis characterized by hema-
tomas and ecchymosis, hematuria, pulmonary and intrace-
rebral hemorrhage and acute renal failure (Burdmann et al.,
1996; Kowacs et al., 2006; Garcia and Danni-Oliveira, 2007).

Poisoned patients present a severe prolongation of the
coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time (PT) and
partial activated thromboplastin time (aPTT). Laboratory
findings include a decrease in plasma levels of fibrinogen,
factors V and XIII, pre-kallikrein, plasminogen, protein C
and a2-antiplasmin, and an increase in the levels of
thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), fragment 1 þ2
from prothrombin activation (F1.2) and D-dimers. No
alterations in von Willebrand Factor, factors X and II levels
were found (Kelen et al., 1995; Zannin et al., 2003). Taken
together, these clinical data indicate that a significant
amount of intravascular thrombin is generated and the
fibrinolytic system is activated in L. obliqua envenomation.
The activation of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis causes
the consumption of plasmatic factors leading to
a consumption coagulopathy characteristic of this type of
envenomation.

Despite this intense consumption coagulopathy, the
platelet number appears to be diminished only in the most
severe cases, been normal in mild ones (Zannin et al.,
2003). However, the platelet function of these patients
during envenomation has not been evaluated. Considering
that platelets participate in several steps of the hemostatic
process, including the amplification and propagation pha-
ses of the blood coagulation (Monroe and Hoffman, 2006;
Hoffman and Monroe, 2001), these elements probably
make a decisive contribution to the appearance of hemor-
rhagic syndrome during envenomation. Analogously,
patients envenomed by Bothrops jararaca snakes presented
a significant impairment of the platelet function that has
been associated with the bleeding disorders observed after
envenomation (Sano-Martins et al., 1997).

Besides the bleeding disorders, Lonomia-envenomed
patients also develop renal problems. Hematuria is
observed in most patients and may evolve to acute renal
failure (Burdmann et al., 1996). A few histological reports of
renal tissue of envenomed patients are consistent with
tubular necrosis (Burdmann et al., 1996; Fan et al., 1998),
but the pathogenesis of acute renal failure in L. obliqua
envenomation is poorly understood. The difficulty of
conducting early renal biopsies due the coagulation
disturbances inherent to the incidents has contributed to
this lack of knowledge. Although, the massive deposition of
fibrin in the glomeruli capillaries due to intravascular
coagulation and/or a direct action of the venom on the
renal microcirculation cannot be discharged as causes of
renal damage (Gamborgi et al., 2006).

Intracerebral hemorrhage is the main cause of deaths by L.
obliqua envenomation. In the state of Parana?, also in Southern
Brazil, hemorrhage of the central nervous system accounted
for the death of 50% of Lonomia-envenomed patients regis-
tered from 1989 to 2005 (Kowacs et al., 2006). However, the
mechanisms that lead to intracerebral hemorrhage in enve-
nomed patients are also poorly understood.
3. Pharmacology and molecular aspects
of experimental envenomation

The dramatic effects of L. obliqua venom in humans have
been partially reproduced in a number of experimental
53



A.F.M. Pinto et al. / Toxicon 56 (2010) 1103–1112 1105
models. The biodistribution of venom components in
animal models was studied by immunochemical and radio-
labeling (Rocha-Campos et al., 2001; Da Silva et al., 2004b).
Venom components could be detected in high quantities in
kidneys, blood and urine as soon as one hour after intra-
peritoneal injection. Lower amounts of venom could be also
detected in lungs, liver, spleen, heart, skeletal muscle and
brain. Two hours after injection, most of the venom has
been already eliminated by urine or remained in kidney
tissue (Rocha-Campos et al., 2001). Furthermore, residual
amounts of venom components could be detected up to 6
and 18 h after injection on the liver and kidneys, respec-
tively (Da Silva et al., 2004b).

3.1. Coagulation and platelet aggregation disturbances

Various in vivo studies have been carried out to
understand the mechanisms of hemostatic disturbances
triggered by L. obliqua caterpillar venom (Kelen et al.,
1995; Rocha-Campos et al., 2001; Prezoto et al., 2002;
Berger et al., 2010). The coagulation disorders observed
in humans after contact with Lonomia caterpillars can be
reproduced in experimental animals. Administration of
the crude extract of L. obliqua bristles to rats, rabbits and
mice causes a dose-dependent increase of clotting time
(PT, aPTT, thrombin time and whole blood clotting time)
and can render the unclottable blood. Bristle extract also
reduced plasma levels of fibrinogen and factor XIII and
increased fibrin degradation products (Kelen et al., 1995;
Prezoto et al., 2002; Berger et al., 2010). Furthermore,
when crude bristle extract was administered in rats and
the bleeding time assay was continuously monitored,
a dose-dependent hemorrhagic effect of the venom was
clearly observed (unpublished results). Envenomed rats
also presented high levels of thrombin, plasmin and
urokinase activities in plasma, indicating that coagulation
and fibrinolysis are activated during L. obliqua enveno-
mation (Berger et al., 2010).

In addition to the coagulation disorders, we have
demonstrated that rats experimentally envenomed with
bristle extract also presented an accentuated impairment of
the platelet aggregation function. The aggregation response,
induced by either ADP or collagen, is decreased in rats’
plasma during the time course of envenomation. Maximum
decrease in platelet aggregation occurred 6 h after venom
injection for both agonists. At this time, even in the presence
of thrombin (the most potent platelet aggregating agent),
inhibition in aggregation was sustained in platelet rich
plasma (PRP). On the other hand, it was found that enve-
nomed animals presented only a slight reduction of
approximately 26 % in the platelet count at 6 h, being
normalized after 24 h of envenomation (Berger et al., 2010).
These results are in accordance with those observed by
Zannin et al. (2003), who analyzed a group of 105 patients
envenomed with L. obliqua, in which only 9% presented
thrombocytopenia (platelet counts &amp;lt;150,000/mL).

The mechanisms involved in platelet aggregation inhibi-
tion also have been investigated. In our model of experi-
mental envenomation, the platelet hypoaggregation was not
related to the low levels of plasma fibrinogen as well, since
fibrinogen replacement in PRP did not reestablished normal
function. Interestingly, normoaggregation was observed
when platelets were separated from plasma through
a washing procedure. In addition, incubation of plasma from
envenomed rats inhibits aggregation response of normal
washed platelets, which indicates that an aggregation
inhibitor is generated in plasma during envenomation.
Moreover, experimentally envenomed animals presented an
increase in nitric oxide (NO) plasmatic levels which coincided
with the maximum inhibitory effect upon platelet aggrega-
tion. Indeed, the in vivo blockade of NO synthase activity by
NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) pretreatment
partially revert the platelet hypoaggregation response
induced by envenomation, thus suggesting that NO can be
one of the mediators that participate in platelet dysfunctions
(Berger et al., 2010). The generation of fibrinogen/fibrin
degradation products (FfDP) and D-dimers during enveno-
mation can also participate in platelet hypoaggregation, since
fragments deriving from fibrin and/or fibrinogen degradation
could bind to the GPIIb–IIIa receptors and prevent normal
platelet aggregation (Thorsen et al.,1986). In fact, envenomed
patients presented high levels of FfDP (Zannin et al., 2003)
and the plasmatic activities of plasmin and urokinase were
significantly increased in envenomed animals (Berger et al.,
2010).

Several toxins of L. obliqua venom could be directly or
indirectly involved with the hemostatic disturbances
observed in humans and experimental animals (Table 1).
Indeed, the venom possesses high proteolytic, procoagu-
lant and fibrin(ogen)olytic activities (Veiga et al., 2003;
Pinto et al., 2006). As shown in Fig. 2, the active princi-
ples present in L. obliqua venom can interfere in several key
points of the victims’ hemostatic system. The enzymes
responsible for these activities are mainly prothrombin and
factor X activators and a fibrinogenase that have been
already isolated and characterized from different
venomous secretions of L. obliqua caterpillars (Donato et al.,
1998; Reis et al., 1999; Pinto et al., 2004; Alvarez-Flores
et al., 2006). The prothrombin and factor X activators
generate significant amounts of intravascular thrombin,
which leads to the activation of coagulation system and to
consumption of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors.
The fibrin(ogen)olytic enzymes degrade both fibrinogen
and fibrin, contributing to the reduction of fibrinogen levels
and to blood incoagulability. Furthermore, fibrin(ogen)o-
lytic enzymes can also participate in generation of FfDP,
which are probably involved in the platelet aggregation
disturbances. Thus, these toxins acts synergistically to
produce the hemostatic disturbances observed in humans
and animal models.

3.2. Intravascular hemolysis

It has been reported that L. obliqua crude venom (bristle
extract) causes intravascular hemolysis in rats, with
a reduction in the number of circulating erythrocytes,
increase in plasma hemoglobin in the first 6 h, with
a decrease in total hemoglobin levels 24 h after enveno-
mation, together with a decrease in haptoglobin levels
(Seibert et al., 2004). Also, the urine of the animals was dark-
red due to the presence of free hemoglobin (no erythrocytes
were found), confirming the occurrence of hemoglobinuria

in these animals. Such hemolytic activity presented by cat-
erpillar’s venom seems to be higher in animal models than
in human. As a matter of fact, intravascular hemolysis has
been observed only in cases where the victim gets in contact
with a large number of caterpillars (Malaque et al., 2006).

A hemolytic activity has been described in crude bristle
extract, which causes direct and indirect hemolysis of
human and rat erythrocytes; such action was assigned to
a phospholipase A2 (Table 1) present in this venomous
preparation. Besides, degradation of cell membrane
proteins was also detected, corroborating with the hemo-
lytic effect observed in animal models (Seibert et al., 2006).
In addition, hemolysis might be also due to deposits of
microthrombi in the vasculature, as observed in thrombotic
microangiopathy. In this case, the thrombi in capillaries
create abnormally high levels of shear stress that fragments
the red blood cells (Tsai, 2006).

3.3. Inflammation and vascular disorders

In addition to hemorrhagic syndrome, the L. obliqua
envenomation could lead to many local effects at the
contact site, such as burning sensation, pain, edema and
erythema (Fan et al., 1998; Correa et al., 2004). These
findings are probably related to the activation of the
inflammation response elicited by the venom injection in
the victim’s body (Da Silva et al., 2004a; Bohrer et al., 2007).
The local pain due to the contact with Lonomia genus
caterpillars is a common event. The pharmacological
mechanisms of L. obliqua induced pain were studied by our
group, using the rat paw model of nociception (De Castro
Bastos et al., 2004). The nociception, evinced as noci-
fensive behavior, was more prominent 5–10 min after the
venom injection, being however, significantly reduced by
the pre-treatment of rats with indomethacin (nonselective
inhibitor of cyclooxygenase), indicating that local pain
induced by L. obliqua envenomation is, at least partially,
mediated by prostaglandins (PG) (De Castro Bastos et al.,
2004).

Despite the clear participation of PG in the nociception
induced by L. obliqua envenomation, other mediators,
namely bradykinin (BK), could contribute to the overall
nociceptive/painful effect, since BK, one of the most
powerful nociceptive agents known to date (Wang et al.,
2006), is produced in L. obliqua envenomation (Bohrer
et al., 2007). We have demonstrated that L. obliqua
venom induces the activation of the kallikrein-kinin
system (KKS) via plasma pre-kallikrein activation. It was
also demonstrated, using guinea pig ileum bioassay, that
the venom was able to generate BK directly from low
molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) (Bohrer et al., 2007).

In this sense, the KKS seems to be the major responsible
for edema formation induced by the contact with L. obliqua
caterpillars (Bohrer et al., 2007). Using mice paw edema

bioassay, we have characterized the edematogenic activity
of L. obliqua venom. The paw edema remains prominent up
to 4–6 h post-envenomation (De Castro Bastos et al., 2004;
Bohrer et al., 2007). Mice pre-treatment with HOE-140 (BK
B2 receptor antagonist) or aprotinin (kallikrein inhibitor)
leads to 50–60% inhibition of the edematogenic response
while loratadine (histamine H1 receptor antagonist) pre-
treatment slightly suppressed the edematogenic activity of
the venom (De Castro Bastos et al., 2004; Bohrer et al.,
2007). On the other hand, pre-treatment of mice with
guanethidine (noradrenergic blocker) or indomethacin has
no effect in L. obliqua induced edema (De Castro Bastos
et al., 2004).

In spite of the local inflammatory effect, L. obliqua
venom seems to be mainly dependent of the humoral
factors (BK, PG, histamine); it also could be related with
cellular responses. The migration and infiltration of
inflammatory cells into the site of venom inoculation
occurs mainly in a late phase (24 h post-envenomation),
and this exudate is composed namely by neutrophils and
monocytes (Ramos et al., 2004).

The pro-inflammatory properties of the venom are
responsible not only for local effects, but also for systemic
disturbances due to its ability to modulate the properties of
the vascular system (Da Silva et al., 2004a; Bohrer et al.,
2007). It is important to note that in some envenomed
patients, mainly in severe cases, systemic vascular and
inflammatory disorders were observed, such as the occur-
rence of drop in blood pressure followed by blood extrav-
asation into the brain (Fan et al., 1998; Kowacs et al., 2006).

Experimental models showed that L. obliqua venom
induces systemic alterations in the vascular tonus and in
56



A.F.M. Pinto et al. / Toxicon 56 (2010) 1103–11121108
vessel wall structure (Da Silva et al., 2004a; Bohrer et al.,
2007). The occurrence of intra-cranial hemorrhages and
neurological disturbances in some patients could be related
with the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB).
Experimental envenomation of rats leads to the increase of
the BBB permeability, evinced by the observation of
lanthanum ions deposition in tissues as seen by electron
microscopy (Da Silva et al., 2004a). This increase in BBB
permeability seems to be related with an alteration in
microvessels diameter, probably via action of pro-inflam-
maory molecules, such as BK (Da Silva et al., 2004a). The
main alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) are
the presence of vacuoles (namely in hippocampus and
cerebellum) and vasogenic edema, which could lead to
blood leakage and hemorrhage into the CNS (Da Silva et al.,
2004a).

In addition, we have shown that L. obliqua venom also
induces a systemic transient drop in mean arterial blood
pressure in experimental envenomation (Bohrer et al.,
2007). This hypotensive effect is totally dependent of the
KKS activation by venom, since the pre-treatment of the
rats with HOE-140 or aprotinin completely abolishes
the vasodilatatory effect (Bohrer et al., 2007).

All the inflammatory and vascular actions of the L.
obliqua venom discussed above could not be related with
only one specific toxin, and also seem to be independent of
the activity of the procoagulant fraction of the venom (De
Castro Bastos et al., 2004; Da Silva et al., 2004a; Ramos
et al., 2004; Bohrer et al., 2007). This fact supports the
hypothesis that the venom overall effect and the enveno-
mation syndrome are the result of the synergistic action of
a cocktail of compounds.

3.4. Gene expression alterations induced by Lonomia
obliqua envenomation

In addition to venom direct actions, L. obliqua bristle
extract produces indirect effects by triggering host cellular
responses. We have demonstrated gene expression
changes in envenomed fibroblasts through the microarray
technology (Pinto et al., 2008). L. obliqua venom produces
a cellular response through up-regulation of several genes
that could be involved in the generation and/or amplifica-
tion of some known clinical manifestations.

One of these effects is involved with activation and
migration of inflammatory cells. Bristle extract induces up-
regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, IL-
6, CCL2 and CXCL1. These mediators may be released by
several cell types after inflammatory stimuli and are che-
moattractants of monocytes, neutrophiles, basophiles and
T-cells, thus modulating the inflammatory response.
Additionally, up-regulation of the adhesive protein ICAM-3
stimulates the inflammatory cell infiltration in injured
tissues. Moreover, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2
(PTGS2), also known as cyclooxygenase 2, a pro-inflam-
matory enzyme that triggers prostanoid biosinthesis, is also
up-regulated. Together, these mediators probably play
a key role in several inflammatory processes which occurs
in the envenomation syndrome (Pinto et al., 2008).

Also, cellular response to envenomation could be
partially involved in other manifestations such as edema,
pain sensation and hypotension (De Castro Bastos et al.,
2004; Bohrer et al., 2007), through up-regulation of
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAR), an
enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of NO. In fact, we have
demonstrated that NO level increases in experimental in
vivo envenomation and participates in platelet aggregation
disturbances (Berger et al., 2010).

Differently from Lonomia achelous (Arocha-Pin?ango
et al., 2000), to date there is no report of a plasminogen
activating activity on L. obliqua venom. However, our gene
expression study revealed up-regulation of urokinase
plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). This data supports
the hypothesis that indirect fibrinolytic system activation
may occur via action of cell plasminogen activators (Pinto
et al., 2008). This activation of the fibrinolytic system may
generate a site of intense proteolytic activity which may be
responsible not only for fibrin degradation but also can
affect extracellular matrix proteins thus activating matrix
metalloprotases, which facilitates cell migration and tissue
remodeling. Moreover, it could be also capable of inacti-
vating coagulation factors V and VIII (Vaughan and
Declerck, 1998).

In addition, microarray results have shown an over-
expression of tissue factor (TF) in envenomed cells. Indeed,
we have demonstrated the cell culture supernatant of
envenomed cells has a procoagulant activity that is not
neutralized by anti-lonomic serum (ALS) suggesting an
indirect venom effect in which cellular response would be
responsible for the amplification of procoagulant stimulus
(Pinto et al., 2008). Taken together, it is reasonable to
propose that L. obliqua venom induces liberation of either
procoagulant microparticles containing TF or a soluble
form of TF (Bogdanov et al., 2003).

3.5. Lonomia obliqua transcriptome

According to a transcriptomic study performed by our
group, it is estimated that there are at least four important
protein families (Table 1) that could be related to the
envenomation symptomatology, especially regarding
hemostatic disturbances (Veiga et al., 2005). Serine
proteinases are the most relevant protein family when
considering their potential of interfering with blood coag-
ulation. Moreover, serine proteases are an expressive
group, representing 16.7 and 25% of the clusters derived
from tegument and bristle transcriptome, respectively
(Veiga et al., 2005). This protein group presents coagulation
factors-like activities, so it is expected that these enzymes
participate in the generation of thrombin, by activation of
FX and prothrombin (Donato et al., 1998), and in the acti-
vation of the fibrinolytic system, contributing directly and
indirectly to fibrinogen degradation (Pinto et al., 2004) and
resulting in the hemorrhagic disorder. In fact, a fibrinoge-
nolytic enzyme has been purified and characterized by our
group (Pinto et al., 2004).

Phospholipases and lectins are other known groups of
proteins that disturb hemostasis and can effectively affect
blood coagulation and platelet aggregation. These proteins
are important components of many other animals’ venoms –
such as snakes, bees and scorpions – and have been well
characterized as important players in the modulation of the
57



A.F.M. Pinto et al. / Toxicon 56 (2010) 1103–1112 1109
hemostatic system. Phospholipases are enzymes that can
directly modulate platelet aggregation and, also, they may
destabilize coagulation complexes by degradation of
phospholipids (Kerns et al., 1999; Kini, 2003). In addition,
these enzymes are able to disrupt cell membranes and thus
the hemolytic activity of L. obliqua bristle extract has been
attributed to a phospholipase activity (Seibert et al., 2004).
Lectins, particularly c-type lectins, are a relatively well-
studied group of proteins in snake venoms that may exert
an additional function in hemostasis modulation by inter-
acting with coagulations factors and/or platelet receptors.
Three lectin clusters were found in the bristle cDNA library,
being LOqua-lect5 a protein with homology to many snake
venom lectins being then another important candidate
contributing to the hemorrhagic disorder.

Besides the enzymatic activities present in the
venomous secretions, hemostasis can also be impaired by
the action of proteinase inhibitors. Among this class of
proteins, it is of special interest the serine proteases
inhibitors (serpins). Serpins are known to have an impor-
tant role in the physiology of insects but, more than that,
they can function as key effectors in hemostasis, by inhi-
bition of coagulation factors. They seem to be also an
important component of the venom representing 27.8 and
10% of the clusters in tegument and bristle, respectively
(Veiga et al., 2005).

The specific properties, functional characteristic and
mechanisms of action of the great majority of the enzymes
or protein classes that constitute L. obliqua venom is still
poorly known and, more than that, the manner by which
these proteins interact with each other and the way they
affect the victim’s physiology is unclear. The trancriptomic
analysis has provided information to new and testable
hypothesis (Veiga et al., 2005).

4. Treatment of Lonomia obliqua hemorrhagic
syndrome

Anti-lonomic serum (ALS) has been produced by
Instituto Butantan through successive intramuscular
injections of bristle extract in horses. Initially, ALS con-
sisted of whole IgG proteins purified from serum and
sterilized by filtration (Dias da Silva et al., 1996). More
recently, ALS preparation was refined by large scale
production of horse serum rich in F(ab0)2 immunoglobulin
fragments able to neutralize L. obliqua venom components
(Rocha-Campos et al., 2001). One milliliter of ALS is
capable of neutralizing the toxic effects present in 3 ID50
(incoagulation-inducing dose 50%, meaning the minimal
dose of L. obliqua bristle extract that delays the blood
clotting time in at least 15 min on 50% of mice tested)
(Rocha-Campos et al., 2001).

From a therapeutic standpoint, ALS has been success-
fully used to re-establish the physiological coagulation
parameters in poisoned patients (Ricci-Silva et al., 2008).
A randomized, prospective controlled trial conducted in
Southern Brazil between 2000 and 2002 with 44 patients
in two distinct treatment groups showed that ALS was
effective in reversing the clinical findings of L. obliqua
envenomation syndrome with no significant adverse
reactions. This study also demonstrated that approximately
three ALS vials of 10 mL were effective for the treatment of
typical envenomation cases (Caovilla and Barros, 2004).

Recently, through a proteomic approach, the ability of
ALS to recognize specific proteins from the crude venom was
used to evaluate the venom immunogenicity (Ricci-Silva
et al., 2008). In some specific experimental conditions the
bidimensional map (by 2D electrophoresis) of L. obliqua
bristle extract exhibit 157 silver-stained spots, being about
of 97% of the spots immunochemically revealed by immu-
noblotting analysis with ALS (Ricci-Silva et al., 2008).
Although no significant novel relevant information about
venom biochemical composition was obtained, since
approximately only 20 spots were further evaluated for
protein identification (Ricci-Silva et al., 2008), the immu-
noproteomic study support the hypothesis that the L. obli-
qua venom was a complex mixture of several largely
immunogenic compounds with no specific(s) toxin(s) as
major candidate(s) for ALS targeting. In fact, the low amount
of L. obliqua venom used to immunize horses compared to
other schemes of venom production and the high antibody
titer obtained also suggests that the caterpillar’s venom
components are strong immunogens (Rocha-Campos et al.,
2001).

Despite the clinical efficacy of the L. obliqua ALS, the
promptly availability of this anti-venom in the regions of
high incidence of accidents still remains a public health
concern, namely in rural areas of Southern Brazil. In this
sense, the use of synthetic drugs to treat the clinical
syndrome induced by venomous animals always was
a promising alternative to heterologous serotherapy, since
these drugs, in general, seem to have more stability, a lower
cost of production, and none of the collateral effects of
heterologous therapy (Gutie?rrez et al., 2007).

Before the development of ALS in Brazil, the use of anti-
fibrinolytic drugs, such as e-aminocaproic acid (EACA), was
officially recommended as therapy against L. obliqua enve-
nomation by the Brazilian Ministry of Health based on the
clinical experience with L. achelous in Venezuela (FUNASA,
2001). Although the use of EACA has been a relative
success in the cessation of clinical evidence of bleeding in
envenomation by L. achelous (Arocha-Pin?ango et al., 1992),
recent data suggest that its use to treat the L. obliqua enve-
nomation should be dismissed (Gonçalves et al., 2007).

In experimental models of L. obliqua envenomation, the
animals treated with EACA after 1 or 6 h post-envenoma-
tion, displayed neither fibrinogen level recovery nor
normalization of coagulation parameters, similarly to
animals treated only with saline. Contrarily, the hemostatic
parameters of the rats treated with ALS return to the
normal values. Moreover, a high death rate was observed in
the group which received an early EACA treatment (15 min.
post-envenomation) (Gonçalves et al., 2007).

Considering the severity of L. obliqua hemorrhagic
syndrome, it is demanding urgent the search for new
natural or synthetic venom inhibitors able to replace or, at
least, be used as a complementary option to serotherapy.
Moreover, this may allow significant advances in the field
and thus, more deep research in the subject is needed. In
fact, several components obtained predominantly from
natural sources have been used to counteract the toxic
effects of different venomous animals (Maiorano et al.,
58

A.F.M. Pinto et al. / Toxicon 56 (2010) 1103–11121110
2005). For L. obliqua venom, we recently demonstrated that
marine algae extracts of Canistrocarpus cervicornis, Stypo-
podium zonale and Dictyota pfaffi were able to antagonize
the in vitro procoagulant effect of the venom. In addition,
the extract of D. pfaffi was also able to inhibit the hemolytic
activity (Domingos et al., 2009). Thus, marine algae may be
used as antivenoms or may contribute to the development
of compounds with antilonomic effects.
5. Final remarks

In spite of the emerging and crescent importance of L.
obliqua envenomations, the biochemical mechanisms of
action and the pathological basis behind the hemorrhagic
syndrome still remains not fully understood. Fig. 3
summarizes all data known to date, concerning the inter-
action of the venom components with the hemostatic and
inflammatory processes as well as with the vascular system.
L. obliqua venom is able to directly and indirectly activate
coagulation and fibrinolysis leading to a consumption coa-
gulopathy. These events, in addition to platelet hypoag-
gregation phenomenon triggers the hemorrhagic syndrome
observed in envenomed patients and experimental models.
Besides, venom has a direct action upon erythrocytes,
causing hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Likewise, induction
of inflammation and disturbances in the vascular system
induces hypotension, pain, edema, cellular infiltration and
increases BBB permeability. Altogether, this physiopatho-
logical manifestations account for the severe clinical profile
observed in L. obliqua envenomation.

Taken together, the results discussed in this review
support the concept that at least part of the physiopatho-
logical alterations in envenomation are due to indirect effects
triggered by venom interaction with victims’ proteins, cells,
tissues and organs. Regardless of all information accumulated
to date, important biochemical and pharmacological prop-
erties of the venom, including its composition and the
mechanism of the envenomation itself, they all remain open
research avenues to be explored. Prospectively it could be
considered the need for a comprehensive proteomic char-
acterization of L. obliqua venomous secretions; identification
of the physiopathological mechanisms behind the acute renal
failure and a complete pathological characterization of
venom toxic effects in specific organs.

Acute Lonomia obliqua caterpillar envenomation-induced physiopathological 

alterations in rats: Evidence of new toxic venom activities and the efficacy of 

serum therapy to counteract systemic tissue damage 

 

 Neste trabalho estão descritas as alterações de toxicidade aguda sistêmica do 

veneno de L. obliqua em ratos. Os principais resultados obtidos foram:  

 

? Além dos distúrbios hemorrágicos clássicos já descritos, o veneno também é 

capaz de induzir lesão em múltiplos órgãos. Importantes alterações bioquímicas, 

hematológicas e morfológicas foram observadas e relacionadas principalmente 

às lesões cardíaca, renal, pulmonar e esplênica;  

? Também há lesão muscular esquelética e o veneno induz dano genotóxico em 

diferentes órgãos incluindo fígado, pulmão, rim, coração e células sanguíneas 

como linfócitos. Há indicativo de que o dano genotóxico é mediado por espécies 

reativas de oxigênio; 

? A administração do soro antilonômico na fase inicial do envenenamento 

(primeiras 2 h) é de fundamental importância para a neutralização dos efeitos 

tóxicos sistêmicos do veneno. Se administrado após 6 h de envenenamento, o 

soro é ineficaz em neutralizar os danos renal e cardíaco e o efeito hemolítico, 

apesar de reverter a coagulopatia de consumo;  

? Os efeitos cardiotóxicos e genotóxicos do veneno foram descritos pela primeira 

vez neste trabalho.

The clinical manifestations of Lonomia obliqua caterpillar envenomation are systemic
hemorrhage and acute kidney injury. In an effort to better understand the physiopatho-
logical mechanisms of envenomation, a rat model was established to study systemic tissue
damage during L. obliqua envenomation. An array of acute venom effects was characterized,
including biochemical, hematological, histopathological, myotoxic and genotoxic alter-
ations. Rapid increases in serum alanine and aspartate transaminases, g-glutamyl trans-
ferase, lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, bilirubin, creatinine, urea and uric acid were
observed, indicating that intravascular hemolysis and liver and kidney damage had occurred.
Treatment with a specific antivenom (antilonomic serum) for up to 2 h post-venom injection
neutralized the biochemical alterations. However, treatment after 6 h post-venom injection
failed to normalize all biochemical parameters, despite its efficacy in reversing coagulation
dysfunction. The hematological findings were consistent with hemolytic anemia and
neutrophilic leukocytosis. The histopathological alterations were mainly related to hemor-
rhage and inflammation in the subcutaneous tissue, lung, heart and kidneys. Signs of
congestion and hemosiderosis were evident in the spleen, and hemoglobin and/or
myoglobin casts were also detected in the renal tubules. Increased levels of creatine kinase
and creatine kinase-MB were correlated with the myocardial necrosis observed in vivo and
confirmed the myotoxicity detected in vitro in isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles.
Significant DNA damage was observed in the kidneys, heart, lung, liver and lymphocytes. The
majority of the DNA lesions in the kidney were due to oxidative damage. The results pre-
sented here will aid in understanding the pathology underlying Lonomia’s envenomation.

1. Introduction

Contact dermatitis and urticarial cutaneous reactions
are well known signs of accidental contact with the hairs
and spines of many lepidopterous larvae (Hossler, 2010).
The consequences of these reactions are usually limited to
local skin inflammation without any systemic tissue dam-
age. However, contact with Lonomia spp. has been associ-
ated with potentially fatal systemic disorders, such as
hemorrhage and acute kidney injury (AKI) (Arocha-
Piñango et al., 2000; Pinto et al., 2010). One of these spe-
cies is the moth Lonomia obliqua (Lepidoptera, Saturniidae),
which is highly venomous in the larval stages. Larval forms
occur during spring and summer in the southern regions of
Brazil (mainly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
Catarina and Paraná) where envenomation by this animal is
an important public health problem due to its high inci-
dence (Veiga et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2010; Guimarães,
2011). In fact, this caterpillar is responsible for severe and
sometimes fatal accidents caused by skin contact with the
bristles that cover the animal’s body. Unlike snakes, spiders
and scorpions, there is no specialized venomous gland in L.
obliqua. The venom is produced by secretory epithelial cells
of the tegument and stored in a hollow internal channel in
each bristle. Because the bristles have weak articulations at
their tips, only a slight contact with the skin is enough to
break off these chitinous structures, injecting the venom
into the subcutaneous tissue of victims (Veiga et al., 2001).
Furthermore, accidents frequently involve colonies of
dozens or hundreds of caterpillars that are camouflaged at
tree trunks, which makes accidental contact more
dangerous due to the venom quantities absorbed by the
victim.

Clinical symptoms include local pain (burning sensa-
tion) and an inflammatory reaction, which starts immedi-
ately after contact, followed by systemic reactions,
including headache, fever, vomiting and hypotension. Signs
of bleeding diathesis, characterized by hematomas, ecchy-
mosis, gross hematuria, hematemesis and melena are
frequently observed between 6 and 72 h after contact. If the
victim is not promptly treated, the clinical profile can
evolve to intracerebral hemorrhage, AKI and death (Zannin
et al., 2003; Kowacs et al., 2006; Garcia and Danni-Oliveira,
2007). Actually, the unique specific treatment available for
L. obliqua envenomation is the early intravenous adminis-
tration of anti-lonomic serum (ALS), an animal-derived
antivenom. ALS is a concentrated pool of immunoglobu-
lins (usually pepsin-refined F(ab0)2 fragments of whole IgG)
that is purified from the plasma of a horse that has been
immunized with the venom (obtained from bristle ho-
mogenates) (Rocha-Campos et al., 2001). In Brazil, ALS is
produced by the Butantan Institute (São Paulo) and has
been successfully used to re-establish physiological coag-
ulation parameters in envenomed patients and experi-
mental models (Caovilla and Barros, 2004). Despite its
clinical efficacy, the prompt availability of ALS and a correct
medical diagnosis in the regions of high incidence of acci-
dents still remain public health concerns, namely, in rural
areas of Southern Brazil. Another important problem is the
fact that administration of ALS does not decrease the inci-
dence of AKI, which is likely also related to the lack of

knowledge about the mechanisms involved in kidney
damage and its management (Gamborgi et al., 2006).

Recently, molecular biology and proteomic studies have
contributed to the increasing number of toxins that have
been identified in L. obliqua venomous secretions,
providing valuable information regarding how this toxin
cocktail acts on biological tissues (Veiga et al., 2005; Ricci-
Silva et al., 2008). Toxins related to envenomation symp-
tomatology, especially those that cause hemostatic distur-
bances, such as serine proteases, phospholipases A2, lectins
and protease inhibitors, were identified. These toxins are
able to directly modulate the victim’s hemostatic system by
proteolytic activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic
cascades, generating high concentrations of intravascular
thrombin, plasmin, urokinase and kallikrein (Reis et al.,
2006; Pinto et al., 2008; Berger et al., 2010a). As a conse-
quence, consumption coagulopathy with decreased levels
of fibrinogen, factors V and XIII, pre-kallikrein, plasmin-
ogen, protein C and a2-antiplasmin occurs (Zannin et al.,
2003). Platelet aggregation function is also markedly
impaired during envenomation, which contributes signifi-
cantly to the bleeding disorders (Berger et al., 2010a,b).
Moreover, the venom also triggers an acute inflammatory
response and disturbances in the vascular system, inducing
increases in blood–brain barrier permeability, hypotension
and the nociceptive and edematogenic responses (Da Silva
et al., 2004a; De Castro Bastos et al., 2004; Bohrer et al.,
2007; Nascimento-Silva et al., 2012).

Despite understanding the mechanisms involved in the
hemorrhagic syndrome, little is known about the systemic
physiopathological effects induced by L. obliqua venom.
Although venom components have been detected in several
organs (including the kidneys, lungs, liver, spleen, heart and
skeletal muscle) of rats following a single subcutaneous
injection of the venom, the systemic tissue damage in these
organs remains poorly characterized (Rocha-Campos et al.,
2001; Da Silva et al., 2004b). For example, the current level
of knowledge regarding the kidney damage is based only on
a few clinical case reports in which hematuria and high
levels of serum creatinine are described as the main features
of L. obliqua-induced AKI (Burdmann et al., 1996). The
venom-induced pathology in other organs remains
completely unknown. In human patients, the impossibility
of conducting early tissue biopsies, due to the coagulation
disturbances inherent to the envenomation, has made it
difficult to analyze the acute anatomopathological alter-
ations. For these reasons, we believe that animal models of
envenomation may be useful not only to characterize the
underlying physiopathology but also to identify previously
unknown toxic activities of the venom. Therefore, the aim of
the present work was to develop a rat model to study sys-
temic tissue damage during L. obliqua envenomation. An
array of acute effects of the venom was characterized,
including biochemical, hematological, histopathological,
myotoxic and genotoxic alterations.

In summary, our data indicate that in addition to hemo-
static abnormalities, there are also signs of multi-organ
damage, mainly in the lungs, heart, kidneys and spleen.
Treatment with ALS is only effective at counteracting the
systemic physiopathological effects if it is administered dur-
ing the initial phase of envenomation. In addition, this study

provides the first experimental evidence of the cardiotoxic,
myotoxic and genotoxic activities of L. obliqua venom.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Venom extraction and antivenom

L. obliqua caterpillars were kindly provided by the
Centro de Informações Toxicológicas (CIT), Porto Alegre, Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil. The specimens used in this study
were collected in the cities of Bom Princípio (Rio Grande do
Sul, Brazil) and Videira (Santa Catarina, Brazil). L. obliqua
venom was obtained by cutting the bristles at the cater-
pillar’s tegument insertion, and the excised material was
kept at 4 ?C prior to the preparation of the extract, which
occurred immediately after dissection. The bristles were
macerated in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
pH ¼ 7.4, and centrifuged at 9600 ? g for 20 min. The su-
pernatant, designated Lonomia obliqua Bristle Extract
(LOBE), was used as the venomous secretion in all experi-
ments. The protein content of the LOBE samples was
determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois,
USA) and the aliquots were stored at ?80 ?C prior to use.
The total number of caterpillars used for bristle extract
preparation was 187 specimens and the protein concen-
tration of the LOBE samples was 3.83 mg/mL. The total
amount of venom extracted per caterpillar was 1.2 mg. All
of the LOBE samples had similar in vitro pro-coagulant ac-
tivities and the protein compositions were also similar, as
monitored by electrophoresis and gel filtration chroma-
tography (Pinto et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2010a,b).

L. obliqua antivenom (antilonomic serum – ALS) was
provided by the Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil). Each
ampoule of ALS (10 mL/vial) is able to neutralize 3.5 mg of
the LOBE. The ALS used here is the same one distributed to
hospitals to treat envenomed patients.

2.2. Animals and ethical statements

Adult male Wistar rats, weighing 250–300 g, were
supplied by the Central Animal Facility (CREAL), Institute of
Basic Health Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do
Sul, Brazil. They were housed in plastic cages (5 animals per
cage) within a temperature controlled room (22–23 ?C, on a
12 h light/dark cycle, with the lights on at 7:00 am) and had
free access to water and food. All procedures involving
animals were carried out in accordance with the Guiding
Principles for the Use of Animals in Toxicology (Interna-
tional Society of Toxicology, http://www.toxicology.org)
and the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation
(COBEA). The experimental protocol was approved by the
ethical committee on research animal care of the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (register number
2008177/2009).

2.3. Experimental design

2.3.1. Venom treatment
To follow the time course of physiopathological alter-

ations, we developed an experimental model of enven-
omation in rats. The animals were divided into two groups:

(i) Control group (CTRL) – Animals (n¼6 per sampling time)
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 100 mL of sterile
PBS solution. (ii) Experimental group (LOBE) – Animals
(n ¼ 8 per sampling time) were injected s.c. with a solution
containing 1.0 mg of the LOBE per kg of body weight in a
final volume of 100 mL. At several time points post-venom
injection (2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h), blood and various or-
gans were collected for biochemical, hematological and
histopathological analysis. This venom dose was selected
based on the results of our previous experiments using rats
as an animal model (Berger et al., 2010a) and was also
based on other studies that have used similar doses to
reproduce the consumption coagulopathy observed in
humans (Dias da Silva et al., 1996; Rocha-Campos et al.,
2001).

2.3.2. Antivenom treatment
The neutralizing ability of the antivenom was tested

using the experimental model of envenomation. Rats that
had previously been injected with the LOBE (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.)
were treated 2 or 6 h after venom injection. At these time
intervals, the animals (n ¼ 8/group) were intravenously
(i.v.) administered through the caudal vein with a sterile
PBS solution (1 mL/100 g of body weight) or ALS (1 mL/
100 g of body weight). Additional control groups (n ¼ 6/
group) were injected only with PBS or ALS under the same
conditions. At 24 h after the treatments, blood was
collected to measure biochemical and hematological
markers of tissue damage. The dose of ALS used here is
sufficient to completely neutralize the in vitro pro-
coagulant activity of the LOBE. Moreover, the same dose
was used in a previous study to compare the efficacy be-
tween ALS and antifibrinolytic drugs (Gonçalves et al.,
2007).

2.4. Blood samples

After treatment, animals from the different groups were
anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a mixture of ke-
tamine (75 mg/kg) (Syntec, São Paulo, Brazil) and xylazine
(10 mg/kg) (Syntec, São Paulo, Brazil), and blood was
collected by cardiac puncture. For the coagulation and he-
matological assays, the blood samples were collected in
1:10 (v/v) 3.8% trisodium citrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-
many) or 1:16 (v/v) 10% Na2-EDTA (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), respectively, while for the biochemical assays,
no anticoagulants were used. All samples had 2% (v/v) ALS
added to block the activity of the toxin after blood collec-
tion. Plasma and serum were obtained by centrifugation at
1500 ? g for 10 min and stored at ?80 ?C prior to use.

2.5. Biochemical parameters

Serum samples were used to measure several
biochemical markers of tissue injury. Blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), creatine kinase (CK),
creatine kinase – MB fraction (CK-MB), aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), g-glu-
tamyl transferase (g-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
plasma free hemoglobin (Hb) and bilirubin (BIL) levels
were determined using commercially available kits

(BioClin/Quibasa, Belo Horizonte, Brazil), following the
manufacturer’s recommended instructions. The absor-
bance was read using a SP-220 spectrophotometer (Bio-
Spectro, Paraná, Brazil), or the protocol was adapted for use
in 96-well plates and the reads were performed using a
SpectraMAX microplate reader (Molecular Devices Co.,
Sunnyvale, USA). Free hemoglobin (Hb) was measured in
the plasma samples that had been collected with Na2-
EDTA. In these cases, plasma Hb levels were determined
directly by spectrophotometry using a standard curve
made with known concentrations of purified Hb (Sigma–
Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Samples with levels of free
Hb higher than 180 mg/dL due to LOBE-induced intravas-
cular hemolysis were diluted to avoid interference during
the determination of other parameters.

2.6. Hematological parameters

Complete blood cell counts were carried out on plasma
samples containing the anticoagulant Na2-EDTA. Hemo-
globin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell
counts (RBC), white blood cell counts (WBC) and the
hematimetric indices (mean corpuscular volume [MCV],
mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] and mean corpus-
cular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) were determined
using an automated cell counter (ABX Micros ESV 60,
Horiba, São Paulo, Brazil). Platelet counts (PLT) were per-
formed using a hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber) with
10% ammonium oxalate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as
diluent. Blood smears stained with May-Grünwald Giemsa
(BioClin/Quibasa, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) were prepared for
direct examination of red blood cell morphology, platelet
morphology and leukocyte differential counts under light
microscopy. Reticulocyte counts (Retic) were also deter-
mined in blood smears with Brilliant Cresyl Blue (Laborclin,
Paraná, Brazil) staining immediately after blood collection.
Retic values were expressed as the % of total RBC counts.
Blood coagulation parameters (activated partial thrombo-
plastin time [aPTT] and fibrinogen concentration [FBG])
were measured in plasma that had been collected with
trisodium citrate by following a previously described pro-
tocol (Berger et al., 2010a).

2.7. Histopathological analyses

All animals from the control and envenomed groups (at
each sampling time) were necropsied and gross macro-
scopic alterations were examined. The kidneys, spleen,
liver, heart, lungs, brain, cerebellum and skin (at the site of
venom injection) were then carefully removed and fixed in
a 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde solution. The tissues
were dehydrated in gradual alcohol from 50% to 100%,
cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently,
the samples were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) for further analysis by light microscopy.

2.8. In vitro myotoxic activity

The in vitro myotoxic activity assays were performed as
previously described (Melo and Suarez-Kurtz, 1988; Fuly
et al., 2003). Briefly, rats were anesthetized (as described

above) and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles
were carefully dissected, weighed and transferred to a bath
chamber with a 2.5 mL capacity. The muscles were super-
fused continuously with a physiological solution (135 mM
NaCl; 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2; 1 mM MgCl2; 1 mM NaHPO4;
15 mM NaHCO3 and 11 mM dextrose, pH ¼ 7.35) that was
equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2. During superfusion,
different concentrations of the LOBE (40 and 80 mg/mL), or
the LOBE (40 mg/mL) that had been previously incubated
with ALS (800 mL), were added to the bath. Bothrops jar-
araca snake venom (Butantan Institute, São Paulo, Brazil),
and Triton X-100 (Sigma–Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA)
were used as positive controls for muscle damage under
the same conditions. Preincubation of the venom with
antivenom was performed at room temperature 30 min
prior to addition to the perfusion bath. Samples of the
perfusate (0.4 mL) were collected at 30 min intervals over a
total period of 120 min and replaced with fresh solution.
The collected samples were stored at 4 ?C and their creatine
kinase (CK) activity was determined according to the pro-
cedure described above (Subsection 2.5). EDL preparations
were mounted in the bath chambers for a period of 60 min
prior to the experiment for measurements of basal CK
release rates, which were defined as the amount of enzyme
released from the muscles into the perfusion bath prior to
the addition of venom. The increase in CK released from
EDL muscles after addition of LOBE was considered to be
indicative of direct myotoxic activity. CK activity was
expressed as enzyme units released into the medium per
gram of muscle (U/g). One enzyme unit was defined as the
amount that catalyzes the transformation of 1 mmol of
substrate per min at 25 ?C.

2.9. Determination of DNA damage and oxidized bases

2.9.1. Sample preparation
The genotoxic activity was detected in vivo using the

model of envenomation described in Subsection 2.3.1. The
blood, liver, lungs, heart and kidneys were collected at 6, 12
and 48 h after LOBE injection (1 mg/kg, s.c.). The organs
were gently homogenized in a cold PBS solution (2 mL) to
obtain a cell suspension. Total blood was used for the
detection of DNA damage in lymphocytes. Genotoxicity was
then evaluated using the comet assay.

2.9.2. Comet assay
The alkaline comet assay was performed as described by

Singh et al. (1988), with minor modifications (Azqueta
et al., 2009; Tice et al., 2000). Briefly, 20 mL of homoge-
nized organs and blood were mixed with 0.75% low-
melting point agarose and immediately spread onto a
glass microscope slide that had been pre-coated with a
layer of 1% normal-melting point agarose. The slides were
then incubated in an ice-cold lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl,
10 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO,
pH ¼ 10.0; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) at 4 ?C for at least
1 h to remove the cellular proteins and membranes, leaving
the DNA as “nucleoids”. In the modified version of comet
assay, the slides were removed from the lysis solution and
washed three times in enzyme buffer (40 mM HEPES,
100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM Na2-EDTA, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA,

pH ¼ 8.0), were drained and were incubated at 37 ?C in this
buffer with one of the following: 70 mL of Fpg (New England
Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) at 100 mU per gel for 45 min (for
the detection of oxidized purines) or 70 mL of Endo III (New
England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) at 100 mU per gel for
30 min (for the detection of oxidized pyrimidines). After
lysis, the slides were placed in a horizontal electrophoresis
unit that had been filled with fresh buffer (300 mM NaOH
and 1 mM EDTA, pH &gt; 13.0), which was left to cover the
slides for 20 min at 4 ?C to allow the DNA to unwind and
reveal the expression of alkali-labile sites. Electrophoresis
was conducted for 20 min at 25 V (78 V/cm) and 300 mA.
All of the steps outlined above were performed under
yellow light or in the dark to prevent additional DNA
damage. The slides were then neutralized (0.4 M Tris,
pH ¼ 7.5), washed in double-distilled water and stained
using a silver staining protocol, as described by Nadin et al.
(2001). After the staining step, the gels were left to dry at
room temperature overnight and were analyzed using an
optical microscope. To ensure adequate electrophoresis
conditions and efficiency, negative and positive internal
controls (human blood with and without 40 mM methyl
methanesulfonate [MMS, Sigma–Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO,
USA] treatment) were included in each experiment. Test
slides were scored only when the internal controls showed
clearly positive or negative results (Greggio et al., 2009).
One hundred cells (50 cells from each of two replicate
slides of each organ) were selected and analyzed for DNA
migration. When selecting the cells, cells around the edges
or air bubbles were excluded (Azqueta et al., 2009). The
cells were scored visually into five classes according to tail
length: class 0: undamaged, without a tail; class 1: with a
tail shorter than the diameter of the head (nucleus); class 2:
with a tail length 1–2 times the diameter of the head; class
3: with a tail longer than 2 times the diameter of the head;
and class 4: comets with no heads. International guidelines
and recommendations for the comet assay consider visual
scoring of the comets to be a well-validated evaluation
method (Burlinson et al., 2007). The genotoxic effects were
estimated based on two different parameters: damage
index (DI) and damage frequency (DF). The damage index
ranged from 0 (completely undamaged: 100 cells ? 0) to
400 (with maximum damage: 100 cells ? 4). The damage
frequency (%) was calculated based on the number of cells
with tails compared to the number of cells with no tails.
Levels of Endo III and Fpg-sensitive sites were calculated
from the DI score obtained with enzyme treatment minus
the score without enzyme treatment (buffered). The
vehicle was used as a negative control, and treatment with
4 ? 10?5 M MMS for 1 h was used as a positive control.

2.10. Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The
results were expressed as the means ? standard error (SE).
All biochemical and coagulation parameters were measured
in triplicate. The significant differences between the mean
values of two experimental groups were determined using
the Student’s t test. When more than two groups were
compared, an analysis of variance was used, followed by

Bonferroni’s post-hoc test to compare pairs of means. P
values less than 0.05 were chosen to establish significance.

3. Results

3.1. Clinical features and post mortem findings

Between 2 and 6 h after LOBE administration (1 mg/kg,
s.c.), the rats presented signs of acute toxicity, including
progressive malaise, lethargy, dyspnea, tachycardia, pros-
tration and high sensitivity at the venom injection site.
Despite general weakness, the animals showed no clear
signs of neuromuscular toxicity, such as muscle trembling,
paralysis or convulsions. Most of the envenomed animals
displayed hematuria (dark-brown urine at 6–12 h), but no
signs of macroscopic skin hemorrhage, petechiae, ecchy-
mosis, suffusions or nasal and eye bleeding were observed.
After 48 h, all of the rats had gradually recovered from the
clinical symptoms and returned to normal. Until the end of
the experiments (96 h), no deaths were registered. The
animals in the control group (injected s.c. with PBS solu-
tion) exhibited no ill effects.

Post-mortem examinations showed evidence of sys-
temic effects of the venom. During the first 12 h period, the
animals displayed blood in the abdominal cavity, signs of
lung hemorrhage (hemorrhagic spots), spleen and kidney
enlargement and congestion (Fig. 1). The kidneys also
seemed to have darkened slightly and had black spots on
their surface (Fig. 1). The bladder was often edematous and
enlarged. The brain and gastrointestinal system appeared
to be macroscopically normal (not shown).

3.2. Biochemical and hematological parameters

To evaluate the acute systemic physiopathological ef-
fects of the venom, several biochemical and hematological
markers of tissue lesions were measured (Table 1). Subcu-
taneous injection of L. obliqua venom caused a marked in-
crease in serum AST, peaking between 12 and 48 h.
Although less markedly than AST, serum ALT also increased
rapidly after the first 2 h, reaching a maximum at 12 h.
Serum levels of g-GT increased over the first 6 h and
remained elevated until 48 h. In comparison to the controls,
high levels of plasma free hemoglobin, LDH and bilirubin
were detected at 6 and 12 h, indicating that intravascular
hemolysis had occurred. Markers of renal damage, such as
creatinine, BUN and uric acid, also displayed important
alterations. Serum creatinine increased mainly between 6
and 96 h, reaching maximal values at 48 h, whereas BUN
increased 12, 24 and 48 h after venom injection, returning
to normal levels thereafter. The animals had hyperuricemia
throughout the time of envenomation, with the levels of
uric acid reaching 8 times the control values (p &amp;lt;0.001)
(Table 1).

Hematological parameters were evaluated at 6, 12 and
48 h post-envenomation. The obtained results are sum-
marized in Table 2. LOBE injection caused a statistically
significant decrease in red blood cell count and hemoglobin
at 12 and 48 h, whereas the platelet count decreased
slightly at 12 h and returned to normal after 48 h. Hemat-
ocrit values were lower when compared to the controls at

all of the time points evaluated. The reticulocyte number
(immature red cells) increased in the blood stream as a
result of hemolysis and anemia. The hematimetric indices,
MCV and MCH, also increased at 48 h, whereas MCHC and
total protein remained unchanged. Envenomed rats dis-
played leukocytosis between 6 and 12 h, mainly due to high
neutrophil (6–48 h) and lymphocyte (6–12 h) counts.
Compared to control values, a 15-fold increase was
observed only in neutrophil numbers at 6 h. A less
expressive increase in monocytes and eosinophil counts
was also observed at the same time. Under light micro-
scopy, the blood smears revealed fragmented erythrocytes,
spherocytes and significant anisocytosis. The leukocytes
appeared to have normal morphology (data not shown).

3.3. Histopathological alterations

Evidence of tissue damage was observed mainly be-
tween 6 and 48 h of envenomation. Skin microscopy, at the
site of LOBE injection, showed hemorrhagic lesions, muscle
necrosis and focal inflammatory infiltration that was
associated with edema of varying intensities (Fig. 2A and
B). At 6 h, the kidneys displayed red-brown and hyaline
pigments, which formed intra-tubular cylinders and/or
accumulated within the tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 2C and
insert in 2D). At 48 h, an inflammatory infiltrate was
observed in the medullar region of the kidneys (Fig. 2D).
Marked diffuse congestion and erythrophagocytosis were
observed in the spleens at 6 h, whereas large aggregates of
hemosiderin engulfed macrophages were noted at 48 h
(Fig. 2E and F). The lungs displayed intense hemorrhaging,
which was evidenced by the presence of abundant eryth-
rocytes in the bronchiolar and alveolar spaces mainly at 6 h.
Lung sections also demonstrated mixed inflammatory
infiltrate of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells that
dilated the alveolar septa (48 h), edema in the pulmonary
parenchyma and perivascular edema (12 h) (Fig. 3). No
morphological changes were observed in the liver, brain
and cerebellum at any of the time points evaluated. After
96 h of envenomation, all organs displayed normal
morphology. The animals in the control group (those that
had been injected with PBS) exhibited no alterations at all.

3.4. Myotoxicity

The myotoxicity of L. obliqua venom was evaluated both
in vivo (Fig. 4) and in vitro (Fig. 5) by measuring the release
of creatine-kinase (CK) and its cardiac isoform, creatine-
kinase-MB (CK-MB), and was also evaluated by morpho-
logical examination. After subcutaneous injection of LOBE
(1 mg/kg), the rats displayed high levels of serum CK, which
was the first evidence of skeletal muscle damage. At 12 h,
serum CK activity had increased 20-fold, reaching levels 40
times higher than control values at 48 h (Fig. 4A). There was
also a significant increase in serum CK-MB activity, which
reached a maximum at 12 h (53.6?7.5 U/L) as compared to
the control group (5.8 ? 0.4 U/L), indicating that cardiac

damage had occurred. These values remained elevated at
24 h (45.6 ? 3.4 U/L) and 48 h (40.0 ? 0.9 U/L) (Fig. 4B).
Heart histopathological analyses confirmed the cardiotox-
icity of the venom. Necrosis of cardiomyocytes was asso-
ciated with inflammation and myocardial hemorrhage
between 6 and 48 h (Fig. 4C–E).

To investigate a possible direct myotoxic effect of the
LOBE, an isolated muscle preparation was used. As shown
in Fig. 5A, when two different concentrations of the LOBE
were added to the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) prepa-
rations, dose- and time-dependent increases in CK release
rates were observed in comparison to the controls (EDL
treated with PBS). This result indicated that the venom has
specific myotoxins that are able to act directly on muscle
cells, which confirms the data obtained systemically in
envenomed rats. When compared with the snake venom
from B. jararaca (a well characterized myotoxic venom), the
LOBE presented a myotoxic activity that was approximately
32.6% lower at the same dose (Fig. 5B). In addition, the
previous incubation of the LOBE with antilonomic serum
(ALS) resulted in a reduction of 70.6% in CK release rate
from the EDL. The highest level of released CK was
observed upon the addition of the cytotoxic compound
Triton X-100 (0.01%), which was used as a non-specific,
non-biological positive control. Taking the muscle injury
induced by Triton X-100 to be 100%, the myotoxic damage
of the B. jararaca and L. obliqua venoms reached 58.8% and
39.6%, respectively, in our experimental conditions.

3.5. Genotoxicity

Because the maintenanceof genomicstabilityis essential
for cellular function, we measured the genotoxic effects
induced by L. obliqua experimental envenomation in vivo
(Fig. 6). In the first set of experiments, DNA damage in the
different organs and lymphocytes of rats 12 h after LOBE
injection (1 mg/kg, s.c.) was assessed using the alkaline

comet assay. For all samples, cell viability was evaluated
using the trypan blue exclusion method and was found to be
greater than 90% in every experiment. The internal controls
for the comet assay, using human blood cells, showed low
damage in the negative control (DI¼0–10) and high damage
in the positive control (DI ¼ 180–300), thus validating the
test conditions. As expected, exposure of the lymphocytes,
heart, lungs, liver and kidney cells that had been isolated
from normal animals to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS),
which was used as positive control, resulted in a significant
increase in DNA damage (not shown). As shown in Fig. 6A,
envenomed rats displayed high levels of DNA damage in the
cells of all organs evaluated, as well as in the lymphocytes.
The damage levels in the cells of the control animals (those
that had been injected with PBS) did not change signifi-
cantly. The damage index in lymphocytes and kidneys
reached levels that were 6.4 and 5.4 times higher than the
levels in their respective controls.

In another set of experiments, the kidneys were chosen
to determine the temporal pattern of DNA damage at
distinct time points after LOBE injection. In such cases,
kidneys were selected because they had the highest dam-
age index among the organs examined and also due to the
high incidence of renal injury observed in human patients
(Gamborgi et al., 2006). At 6 h, kidney DNA damage had
increased, reaching a maximal level at 12 h. After 48 h, the
damage index decreased but was still significantly different
from the controls (Fig. 6B). In order to verify the oxidative
nature of the DNA damage detected in the kidney cells of
LOBE-injected rats, we carried out a modified comet assay.
While the alkaline test normally detects primarily repair-
able DNA single- and double-strand breaks and alkali-labile
sites, the modified version is more specific to oxidative
damage than the standard method. The modified version
includes an incubation step with lesion-specific endonu-
cleases that recognize resultant abasic sites and convert
them into single-strand breaks. In the present study, we

used Fpg, which is specific for oxidized purines, and Endo
III, which targets oxidized pyrimidines. Thus, increases in
the damage index after enzyme incubation specifically
represent the extent of oxidative DNA damage. As shown in
Fig. 6C and D, there was an increase in the oxidative
damage score after incubation with Fpg and Endo III,
indicating the presence of oxidized purines and pyrimi-
dines. As the levels of ordinary and oxidatively generated
DNA adducts were similar (mainly between 6 and 12 h), the
majority of the DNA damage observed in the kidneys was
likely due to oxidative insult (Fig. 6B–D).

3.6. Effects of antivenom treatment on markers of systemic
tissue damage

Since the administration of antilonomic serum (ALS) is
the only specific treatment actually available for L. obliqua
envenomation, we decided to test its efficacy in

neutralizing biochemical and coagulation abnormalities
using our experimental model. For this purpose, ALS was
intravenously administered at 2 or 6 h post-LOBE injection
(1 mg/kg, s.c.). After 24 h of envenomation, different
biochemical markers and coagulation parameters were
determined (Table 3). Generally, treatment with ALS is able
to neutralize LOBE-induced biochemical alterations only if
administered within the first 2 h of envenomation. For
example, animals treated with ALS at 2 h had a decrease of
3.6- and 2.5-fold in the levels of serum creatinine and urea,
respectively, when compared with the group treated 6 h
after LOBE injection. In addition, both the creatinine and
urea levels of the envenomed animals that had been
treated at 2 h with ALS were not significantly different from
the values observed in non-envenomed rats that had been
treated with PBS or ALS, indicating that these levels had
returned to control values. Similar results were obtained
for other parameters, such as CK, CK-MB, AST and ALT,

which became normalized only in envenomed rats that had
received ALS within the first 2 h. Likewise, plasma hemo-
globin levels were also decreased in envenomed rats when
ALS was injected at 2 h. However, this reduction was not
statistically significant in comparison to envenomed ani-
mals that had been treated with PBS instead of ALS. Thus,
ALS was not able to completely reverse intravascular he-
molysis, even if given early after envenomation.

As expected, envenomed animals that were treated with
PBS developed consumptive coagulopathy, with lower
levels of fibrinogen and prolonged activated partial
thromboplastin time (Table 3). In this case, the treatment
with ALS both at 2 or 6 h after venom injection normalized
the coagulation parameters. The macroscopic and

histological signs of hemorrhage were also absent in the
envenomed groups that had received ALS injections at 2 or
6 h (results not shown).

4. Discussion

In the present study, we used an experimental model in
rats to investigate the acute physiopathological effects of L.
obliqua venom. This model allowed for the broad charac-
terization of venom-induced tissue damage, including
biochemical, hematological, histopathological, myotoxic,
cardiotoxic and genotoxic alterations.

Envenomed animals showed macroscopic and histo-
logical evidence of systemic hemorrhages, confirming the
main clinical profile observed in human patients (Zannin
et al., 2003). Bleeding in the abdominal cavity and subcu-
taneous tissue, hematuria and hemorrhages in the
myocardium and pulmonary parenchyma were observed in
our experimental animals. Actually it is known that
different venom toxins are involved in these hemorrhagic
alterations. Most of the toxins are serine proteases, an
expressive group representing 16.7% and 25% of the clusters
derived from the tegument and bristle transcriptomes,
respectively (Veiga et al., 2005). This protein group displays
coagulation factor-like activities, so these enzymes are ex-
pected to participate in the generation of thrombin by
activation of factor X and prothrombin (Veiga et al., 2009;
Berger et al., 2010a) and in the activation of the fibrino-
lytic system, contributing directly and indirectly to fibrin-
ogen degradation (Pinto et al., 2006), resulting in
consumption coagulopathy. In fact, serine proteases with
fibrinogenolytic, prothrombin and factor X activating ac-
tivities have been purified and characterized in this venom
(Alvarez-Flores et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2004; Reis et al.,
2006). Rats injected intravenously with one of these en-
zymes, a purified prothrombin activator, displayed coa-
gulopathy that was associated with reduced levels of
fibrinogen, pulmonary hemorrhage and leukocyte infiltra-
tion in the lungs (Reis et al., 2001), which was similar to the
observations presented here for whole venom.

In addition to the hemostatic abnormalities, the rats
displayed intravascular hemolysis, as evidenced by alter-
ations in several parameters, such as high levels of free
hemoglobin, increased unconjugated bilirubin levels, high
serum LDH activity, decreased RBC counts and hematocrit,
and the presence of reticulocytes (immature RBCs), spher-
ocytes and fragmented RBCs in the blood smears. The
spleens of the envenomed animals also presented signs of
erythrophagocytosis and deposits of hemosiderin, indi-
cating high clearance of defective RBCs and the accumu-
lation of hemoglobin metabolic products. An important
contribution of this hemolytic process to venom-induced
pathology is most likely related to the deposition of he-
moglobin in the renal tubules. Hemolysis-related AKI is
characterized by the formation of tubular hemoglobin
casts, which are highly nephrotoxic (Zager, 1996). In the
present study, envenomed animals presented red-brown
and hyaline pigments with a granular appearance in their
renal tubules which were most likely due to the formation
of hemoglobin and/or myoglobin deposits. Reports

an experimental study confirming the occurrence of
intravascular hemolysis, have already been published
(Seibert et al., 2004; Malaque et al., 2006). However, little is
known regarding the ability of ALS to neutralize hemolytic
effects. Our data indicate that ALS was not able to
completely reverse intravascular hemolysis, even if
administered early in the envenomation. The case report of
hemolysis-related AKI also indicated that treatment with
ALS did not reduce hemoglobin levels to normal values and
the patient did not completely recover renal function until
1 month after the accident, despite improvements in
coagulation tests (Malaque et al., 2006). Until now, the
main component with high in vitro hemolytic activity iso-
lated from this venom was the phospholipase A2 enzyme,
although the presence of proteolytic enzymes that act
specifically on the membrane glycoproteins of erythrocytes
cannot be ruled out (Seibert et al., 2006, 2010).

Since myotoxins are commonly described in several
snake, spider and bee venoms, the presence of myotoxic
activity in L. obliqua was investigated using specific
biochemical markers, in vitro experiments and histological
analyses. In this sense, elevations of serum CK and CK-MB
activities were detected, indicating systemic damage to
skeletal and cardiac muscles. CK is a dimer with M and B
subunits that is found primarily in the muscle, myocardium,
brain and lung tissues and exists as three dimeric iso-
enzymes: CK-MM, CK-MB and CK-BB. CK-MB accounts for
5%–50% of total CK activity in the myocardium and is well-
established to be a clinical marker that can confirm acute
myocardial infarction both in humans and experimental
animals (Apple and Preese, 1994; Shashidharamurthy et al.,

Fig. 4. In vivo myotoxic and cardiotoxic activities. Serum levels of creatine kinase (A) and creatine kinase-MB (B) during the time-course of L. obliqua enven-
omation in rats. Histopathological analyses of the heart confirmed the cardiotoxicity of the venom. At 6 h of envenomation, there were extensive areas of
myocardial hemorrhage (C). Necrosis of cardiomyocytes (D) and inflammation (E) were observed mainly at 12 and 48 h, respectively. These alterations are shown
in detail in the insert of each image. Arrowheads in panel D indicate necrotic cells. All sections were stained with H&amp;amp;E. Magnifications: 10? (Panels C, D and E);
20? (Insert in C); 40? (Inserts in D and E). Biochemical data are presented as the means ? SE. Each sample from the control (CTRL, n ¼ 6, injected with PBS, s.c.)
or envenomed animals (n ¼ 8, injected with LOBE, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) was measured in triplicate. Values of p &amp;lt;0.001 were considered to be significantly different from
the controls.

concentrations of LOBE were added to the perfusion bath containing the EDL
muscles. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times to determine creatine
kinase (CK) levels. Each time point represents the means ? SE of six inde-
pendent experiments. The levels of CK that were released from EDL previ-
ously treated with LOBE differed from the controls at all time points
(p &amp;lt;0.05). B. The myotoxic activity of LOBE was also compared in the
presence or absence of antilonomic serum (ALS). Bothrops jararaca venom
(BjV) and Triton X-100 (0.01%) were used as positive controls for myotoxic
activity. After 120 min, aliquots were taken for the CK determinations. Data
are expressed as the means ? SE (n ¼ 6/group). Values of p &amp;lt;0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant for the comparisons among the
groups.

2010). Correlated with the increases in CK and CK-MB, his-
tological analyses revealed extensive muscle damage
mainly in the subcutaneous tissue (at the local site of venom
injection) and myocardial necrosis. These observations
support the idea that the LOBE has cardiotoxic activity,
which was unknown up until now. Clinical reports of human
envenomation that are available in the literature do not
describe symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, and CK or CK-MB
levels are rarely measured in these patients, making it
difficult to make any comparisons with our experimental
data. Our hypothesis is that the contribution of muscle
damage observed herein is more related to myoglobin
release from the myocytes or cardiomyocytes than to a
mechanism that is associated with heart dysfunction.
Indeed, similar to hemoglobin, myoglobin can also precipi-
tate in renal tubules, after being filtered by the glomeruli,
and forms obstructive casts. The direct myotoxic activity of
LOBE was confirmed in vitro by the experiments with iso-
lated EDL muscles. LOBE showed a dose- and time-
dependent myotoxicity in isolated EDL, although its po-
tency was lower when compared to B. jararaca venom. In
fact, different myotoxins have been described in B. jararaca
venom, including metalloproteinases and myotoxic

phospholipaseA2 (Zelanisetal., 2011), whilein L. obliquathe
toxins responsible for this activity remain completely un-
known. However, L. obliqua myotoxins seem to be recog-
nized by ALS because treatment with this serum was able to
reverse CK release in vitro (from EDL muscle) and in vivo if
administered within 2 h of envenomation.

Though AKI is the leading cause of death following L.
obliqua envenomation, the mechanisms involved in kidney
disorders are poorly understood (Gamborgi et al., 2006).
The current knowledge is based on clinical data from
human victims in which hematuria, high levels of serum
creatinine and acute tubular necrosis were described to be
the main features of L. obliqua-induced AKI (Burdmann
et al., 1996). In our experimental model, in addition to the
high levels of serum creatinine, the rats also displayed
uremia and hyperuricemia, suggesting impaired renal
function. Generally, the mechanism underlying venom-
induced AKI is complex and appears to be multifactorial.
Until now, studies performed with a variety of nephrotoxic
venoms have indicated that AKI is associated with both the
direct cytotoxic action of the venom on renal structures and
a secondary response of the whole organism resulting from
systemic envenomation (Abdulkader et al., 2008; Berger

and p &amp;lt;0.001 (*) were considered to be statistically significant in comparison to the control groups.

et al., 2012). The secondary response is usually triggered by
renal inflammation, oxidative damage and the release of
cytokines and vasoactive substances that lead to changes in
renal function and hemodynamics. Hemolysis, rhabdo-
myolysis and/or the intravascular deposition of platelets
and fibrin in the kidney microcirculation are also important
contributors to this process (Sitprija, 2006). Recently, high
levels of uric acid were observed to play an important role
in AKI induced by Crotalus envenomation, since the treat-
ment with allopurinol, a hypouricemiant agent, signifi-
cantly reduced the lethality rate and ameliorated renal
histopathological changes (Frezzatti and Silveira, 2011).
Marked hyperuricemia is known to cause AKI by the su-
persaturation, crystallization and deposition of urate crys-
tals, as well as by contributing to renal vasoconstriction,
since soluble uric acid has been shown to inhibit endo-
thelial NO bioavailability (Yamasaki et al., 2008; Ejaz et al.,
2007). During L. obliqua envenomation, the rats also pre-
sented high levels of uric acid, tubular obstructive casts and
inflammatory infiltrates in the kidneys. However, the actual
contribution of these elements to AKI requires further
study. Interestingly, antivenom serotherapy was able to
reduce creatinine and urea levels only if administered
within 2 h of LOBE injection. Antivenom treatment after 6 h
was unable to fully correct the renal parameters, despite its
ability to normalize coagulation abnormalities. Thus, it
seems that the time elapsed between the accident and the
administration of antivenom is crucial for a successful renal
therapy. Confirming our observations, it was demonstrated
that a time interval of more than 2 h between the accident
and administration of the antivenom was associated with
the development of AKI, as well as with the risk of death or
permanent injuries after Bothrops and Crotalus envenom-
ation (Otero et al., 2002; Pinho et al., 2005).

Unlike the lungs, kidneys, spleens and hearts, no
morphological changes were observed in the livers, brains
and cerebellums of rats that had been injected with L.
obliqua venom. Nevertheless, biochemical markers of acute
liver injury (AST, ALT and g-GT) were increased in the
serum of animals after envenomation. As it is known that
some of these enzymes are not specific to the liver, it is
possible that they were derived from other sources, such as
the red blood cells or skeletal muscle. For instance, in-
creases in AST activity are also associated with damage to
cardiac and skeletal muscle and the kidneys (Prado et al.,
2010; Shashidharamurthy et al., 2010). Despite these
apparently conflicting observations, we cannot rule out the

occurrence of liver injury, mainly because evidence of DNA
damage was detected in liver cells using the comet assay.
Probably, these findings indicate that the extent of acute
hepatic injury in this model of envenomation was subtle
and did not lead to gross histological alterations.

As mentioned above, L. obliqua envenomation may have
triggered an intense inflammatory response, which may be
involved in several of the clinical manifestations. The acti-
vation of the kallikrein-kinin system and the consequent
release of vasoactive mediators (mainly bradykinin, hista-
mine and prostaglandins) seems to play an essential role in
the edematogenic, nociceptive and vascular effects (Bohrer
et al., 2007). Accordingly, we have shown that during en-
venomation the animals experienced neutrophilic leuko-
cytosis, indicating that a systemic inflammatory response
had occurred. Histological sections also provided evidence
of inflammatory cell infiltrates in the heart, lungs and
kidneys. Corroborating these results, a clear activation in
the vascular bed that was characterized by an increase in
leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the endothelium was
observed in hamster cheek pouch venules that had previ-
ously been incubated with low doses of LOBE (Nascimento-
Silva et al., 2012). The up-regulated expression of genes
from pro-inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules,
such as IL-8, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL1, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and
ICAM-3, was also detected in endothelial cells and fibro-
blasts after incubation with LOBE. Once released, these
mediators acted as chemoattractants, inducing inflamma-
tory cell migration to the sites of injury (Pinto et al., 2008;
Nascimento-Silva et al., 2012).

Recently, classical methods of genetic toxicology have
been applied to the identification of potential therapeutic
agents in animal venoms (mainly for the treatment of some
types of cancer) and have also provided a better under-
standing of the toxic mechanisms of action of these venoms
in the human body (Marcussi et al., 2011, 2013). During
envenomation, genotoxic damage can occur directly due to
the cytotoxic activity of the venom or indirectly through
the production of cytotoxic mediators (such as free radicals,
for example) in response to tissue injury. In both cases, the
damage could lead to DNA fragmentation and eventually,
cell death. In the case of cell survival, DNA lesions not
corrected during the cell repair process might result in
permanent mutations and changes to cellular morphology
or physiology that could also be transmitted hereditarily to
future generations. Therefore, it is possible that the geno-
toxic effects are involved not only in the acute toxicity, but

also in chronic diseases, and may even be involved in
mutagenic and carcinogenic events resulting from enven-
omation. In this sense, it has been shown that some
Bothrops toxins are able to induce genotoxic and mutagenic
effects in isolated human lymphocytes, as evidenced by the
comet and micronucleus assays, respectively (Marcussi
et al., 2013). Here, various organs of animals that had
been injected with L. obliqua venom presented DNA lesions,
indicating the high genotoxic potential of this venom. DNA
damage was detected in the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver and
lymphocytes of envenomed rats. Specifically, DNA lesions
in the kidneys were prominent 6, 12 and 48 h post-
envenomation, and the majority of these lesions were
due to oxidative damage because oxidized purines and
pyrimidines were detected. In fact, the possible production
of free radicals during envenomation should be considered
in an effort to understand the complex mechanisms
involved in kidney dysfunction. In this case, the presence of
hemoglobin and/or myoglobin deposits in the renal tubules
may contribute to kidney dysfunction, since the degrada-
tion of these molecules releases free iron and heme, which
catalyze the production of free radicals and induce lipid
peroxidation, respectively (Zager, 1996; Yamasaki et al.,
2008). The participation of oxidative damage was
confirmed in a model of Crotalus-induced AKI, in which
treatment with antioxidant agents protects against venom-
mediated nephrotoxicity (Alegre et al., 2010).

5. Conclusions

In this work, we characterized a series of acute physio-
pathological effects induced by the subcutaneous injection
of L. obliqua venom in rats. Our data reveal important
biochemical, hematological and histopathological alter-
ations, suggesting the occurrence of multi-organ damage
and confirming that the rat is a good animal model for
studying hemorrhagic disturbances, as well as organ spe-
cific injuries, such as AKI. Interestingly, myotoxic, car-
diotoxic and genotoxic activities were identified during our
experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
show these activities of L. obliqua venom. Finally, the
findings presented here emphasize the fact that a correct
diagnosis and early treatment is essential for successful
antivenom serotherapy, since the efficacy of serotherapy in
neutralizing the physiopathological alterations is only
observed if serotherapy is administered during the initial
phase of envenomation.

1. Introduction  

Snakebites and accidents caused by venomous arthropods (mainly spiders, scorpions, 
bees, wasps and caterpillars) are important public health problem. Despite of this, public 
health authorities, nationally and internationally, have given little attention to this 
problem worldwide (Warrell, 2010; Williams et al., 2010). As a consequence, the morbidity 
and mortality associated with snake and arthropod envenoming produce a great impact 
on the population and on the health-care systems. One of the most important and lethal 
effect of these animal venoms is nephrotoxicity (Sitprija, 2006). Specifically in South 
America and Brazil, the main snakes responsible for cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) are 
those from Bothrops and Crotalus genus. Among venomous arthropods, AKI has been 
reported after accidents with bees, spiders of the genus Loxosceles and caterpillars of the 
genus Lonomia.  

Taking in account the importance of accidents with these venomous animals, in this chapter 
we reviewed the main mechanisms that play a role in AKI induced by the most common 
snakes and arthropods found in South America. The following key aspects are addressed: 
Epidemiology, clinical renal manifestations, renal pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical 
management of AKI and the currently experimental models used to study the venom- 
induced AKI.  

2. Epidemiology and prevalence of venomous snakes and arthropods in 
South America 

Given the wide distribution of venomous animals, particularly in tropical and subtropical 
regions, the extensive number of accidents and the complexity of the clinical conditions it 
causes, the distint types of envenomation can be considered a global problem because they 
assume great public health importance, especially in the poorest areas of the world  (World 
Health Organization [WHO], 2007). This environmental and occupational disease affects 
mainly agricultural workers and their children in some of the most impoverished rural

communities of developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania. 
Populations in these regions experience high morbidity and mortality because of the poor 
access to health services, which are often suboptimal, and, in some instances, a scarcity of 
antivenom, which is the only specific treatment so far tecnically possible to be available. A 
large number of victims survive with permanent physical and psychological sequelae 
(Gutiérrez et al., 2010; Kasturiratne et al., 2008; Warrell, 2010).  

A group of venomous animals is responsible for medically important accidents: snakes, 
scorpions, spiders, caterpillars, bees and wasps. Global epidemiological data on accidents 
with these different types of animals are scarce and often depend on the existence of 
country-specific estimates based on hospital admissions data and community-based 
population surveys. Unfortunately, in the low-income countries, where most accidents 
occur, there is not such a well organized health systems in order to correctly report the 
envenomation cases (Kasturiratne et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2010). Nevertheless, after the 
incorporation of snakebite envenomations on the World Health Organization list of 
neglected tropical diseases in 2009 (www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/ 
snakebites/en/), more attention has been given to the lack of information on the true 
epidemiological impact of accidents, especially in the cases of snakebites. Current data 
indicate that 5.4 to 5.5 million people are bitten by snakes each year, resulting in near 
400,000 amputations, and between 20,000 to 125,000 deaths (Chippaux, 1998, Kasturiratne et 
al., 2008; Williams et al., 2010). The highest burden of snakebite was identified in South and 
Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America. Annually, Asia and 
Africa have incidence rates of 1.2 million and 1 million bites with 60,000 and 20,000 deaths, 
respectively. In Central and South America, epidemiological data indicate the occurrence of 
300,000 snakebites per year which result in 4,000 deaths and approximately 12,000 cases of 
physical sequelae (Chippaux, 2011; Gutiérrez et al., 2010).  

Specifically in Brazil, data from the System of Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Health 
indicate the ocorrence of 107,364 accidents with venomous animals in the year of 2009 
(including cases of snake, scorpion, spider, caterpillar and bee envenomations) which 
resulted in 290 deaths. When compared to the 2008 year  there were an increase of 12 % and 
16 % in the total number of accidents and deaths, respectively (Boletim eletrônico 
epidemiológico, 2010). The majority of reported cases was caused by snakes and scorpions, 
which were also responsible for the highest rates of lethality (Table 1). Most snakebite (53 %) 
occurred from January to May, which reflect the influence of seasonal factors, such as an 
increase in temperature and humidity associated with the rainy season in some regions of 
Brazil. Human agricultural activities were also associated with envenomations, since 78 % of 
accidents occurred in rural areas. Snakes of Bothrops genus (Lance-headed pit vipers) were 
responsible for 90.5 % of the accidents while snakes of Crotalus genus (South American 
rattlesnakes) accounted for 7.7 % of total cases, showing however, a much higher lethality 
index (1.25 %) than that for Bothrops snakes (0.35 %) (Ministério da Saúde, 2001). Analysing 
the different regions of Brazil, the highest proportion of snakebites in relation to the 
population is localized in the North Region (Amazon Forest) with 53.9 accidents/100,000 
inhabitants, probably due to the difficulty of patients to access health services and/or to the 
delay in the administration of antivenom (Table 1). Among all venomous animals, the 
scorpion stands out for its high and growing number of accidents in Brazil. Compared to the 
2008 year, there was an increase of 7,050 cases in 2009 (45,721 versus 38,671 cases in 2008).

According to Chippaux and Goyffon (2008), scorpions are responsible annually for 1.2 
million accidents and for about 3,250 deaths in the world. In Brazil, the increased number of 
scorpion accidents has been attributed to its adaptation to urban and domiciliar areas 
(Ministério da Saúde, 2001). In this case, the highest incidence was registred in the Northeast 
Region (Table 1). In contrast, accidents with spiders, caterpillars and bees are a growing 
problem in states of Southern Brazil. Specifically in the state of Paraná the brown spider 
(Loxosceles genus) is the most important venomous animal responsible for the high incidence 
of spider envenomation in the whole South Region (da Silva et al., 2004). In contrast, in the 
states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina the caterpillar Lonomia obliqua, also called 
taturana (from the American-Indian Tupi-Guarani tatá, which means fire, and raná, similar 
to), has been associated with severe cases of hemorrhagic syndrome (Veiga et al., 2009). In 
this  case, although accidents may occur throughout the year, 80 % of cases were reported 
during summer, when the animal is in the larval stage of its life cycle. Between 1997 and 
2005 there were 984 accidents only in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, resulting in a mortality 
rate of 0.5 % (Abella et al., 2006). Currently, the therapeutic use of specific antivenom 
(antilonomic serum) has decreased the number of deaths (Table 1). Among bee accidents, 
the most dangerous are caused by Apis mellifera (Africanized bees). In these cases the high 
number of deaths (30 in 2009) has been associated mainly with the absence of a specific 
antivenom and the occurence of allergic reactions (Boletim eletrônico epidemiológico, 
2010).

3. Clinical renal manifestations due to snake and arthropod envenomation 

A broad clinical spectrum of renal function impairment has been reported in snake and 
arthropod envenomations (Sitprija, 2006). As the kidneys are highly vascularized organs 
and have the ability to concentrate substances into the urine they are particularly susceptible 

83



 
Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

160 

to venom toxins. The most common clinical renal manifestations seen in human patients is 
acute tubular necrosis, but all renal structures may be involved. Thus, the occurrence of 
acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal cortical necrosis, mesangiolysis, vasculitis, 
glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, haematuria and myoglobinuria have also been described 
(Sitprija, 2006). 

In this subsection, we reviewed the clinical characteristics of human accidents with snakes 
and arthropods that cause AKI which are highly prevalent in Brazil and other regions of 
Latin America. Envenomations by the following animals were analysed: Bothrops and 
Crotalus snakes, the brown spider Loxosceles, africanized bees, wasps and the caterpillars of 
genus Lonomia. Despite the significant number of accidents with scorpions (Table 1), cases of 
AKI have not been associated to them. In fact, it is known that the main target of scorpion 
venom is the nervous and cardiac systems (Cologna et al., 2009). 

3.1 Snakebite envenomation 

Envenomation by snakebite, indenpendently of the species responsible for the bite, enforces 
medical emergencies since different organs and tissues can be affected at the same time. In 
Brazil, most severe cases result from bites by snakes of the family Viperidae (pit vipers and 
true vipers). Within this family are the Bothrops and Crotalus snakes. Specifically in the 
Bothrops genus there are more than 30 species distributed from southern Mexico to 
Argentina, including Brazil. The most important species are Bothrops asper, B. jararaca, B. 
atrox, B. moojeni, B. jararacussu and B. alternatus. Bothrops snakes preferentially inhabit rural 
areas and moist forest environments. But these snakes also invade cultivated areas and 
ambients with rodents’ proliferation. Bothrops snakes have nocturnal habits and an 
aggressive defensive behavior and its venom present proteolytic, coagulant and 
hemorrhagic active principles that are directly or indirectly implicated in the local and 
systemic effects observed upon envenoming  acidents (Warrel, 2010). Local effects due to the 
envenoming by these snakes are characterized by bleeding, swelling, pain and sometimes 
blisters, and can be frenquently complicated by the development of local abscesses and 
necrosis. Occasionally, compartmental syndrome may develop, which results in functional 
or anatomic loss of the bitten limb (Gutiérrez et al., 2006). Signs of systemic envenoming 
include gingival hemorrhage, microscopic hematuria, ecchymosis and consumption 
coagulopathy and, more rarely, epistaxis, hemoptosis, menorrhagia and hematemesis 
(Gutiérrez et al., 2006; Otero et al., 2002). Disturbances of hemostasis also include severe 
afibrinogenemia, thrombocytopenia and platelet aggregation dysfunction (Santoro and 
Sano-Martins, 2004). Deaths are usually attributed to renal injury, shock, severe bleeding, 
and complicating sepsis. 

Renal dysfunction can occur early in the human bothropic envenomation which often 
induces oliguria and is accompanied by an increase in the plasma creatinine concentration. 
The need for dialysis ranges from 33 % to 75 % of cases (Pinho et al., 2008). AKI is mainly 
due to acute tubular necrosis and acute cortical necrosis and occasionally 
glomerulonephritis (Table 2) (Rodrigues-Sgrignolli et al., 2011). These renal pathological 
alterations have been attributed mainly to hemodynamic changes in response to 
envenomation, hemoglobinuria, intravascular clot formation and direct venom 
nephrotoxicity. 

84

161 

By analyzing a series of retrospective studies, Pinho et al. (2008) reported that the prevalence 
of AKI after Bothrops envenomation ranges from 1.6 % to 38.5 %. In most of these reports 
AKI diagnosis was based on the increase in the plasma creatinine and/or blood nitrogen 
urea being, the creatinine clearance barely estimated. The main reported factors influencing 
AKI prevalence upon such envenomation are: the patient’s age (children under 10 year of 
age have been shown to be more susceptible to develop AKI); the snake’s age (venom 
composition can vary even within the same species, according to the snake’s age); bite site 
and amount of inoculated venom; and the time elapsed until antivenom treatment. 
Moreover, pre-existing diseases such as hypertension, diabetes or previous nephropathies 
may become patients more vulnerable to the effects of venom (Rodrigues-Sgrignolli et al., 
2011; Zelanis et al., 2010). Taking in consideration all the above factors, the mortality rate of 
Bothrops venom-induced AKI range from 13 % to 19 %. 

Other snakes well known for their nephrotoxicity are the South American rattlesnakes 
(Crotalus snakes). In Brazil, the Crotalus genus is represented by a single specie, Crotalus 
durissus, that is composed of six subspecies: Crotalus durissus terrificus, C. d.collilineatus, C.d. 
cascavella, C.d. ruruima, C.d. marajoensis and C.d. trigonicus. Besides sharing some common 
characteristics with other venomous snakes, the Crotalus genus presents a rattle at the end of 
its tail, which is a particular characteristic of these snakes making easier their identification. 
In general the Crotalus snakes are found in rocky and drier regions. They are rarely found in 
humid forests and feed mainly of small rodents. They are robust (may reach 1 meter in 
length) and are less agressive than Bothrops snakes (Ministério da Saúde, 2001). 

Among the six different subspecies, C.d. terrificus is the most frequently implicated in 
envenomation cases registered in Brazil. The venom has neurotoxic, myotoxic, and 
nephrotoxic activities (Table 2). In neuromuscular junctions, the venom leads to a powerful 
presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release, which is responsible for the neuromuscular 
blockade and progressive flaccid paralysis of variable degrees. Eyelid ptosis, blurred and/or 
double vision, ophthalmoplegia and facial muscle paralysis are common manifestations of 
venom neurotoxicity. The myotoxic activity of the venom also produces severe skeletal 
muscle injury leading to myalgia and rhabdomyolysis with the subsequent release of 
myoglobin from damaged skeletal muscle into serum and urine (Azevedo-Marques et al., 
1987). Indeed, the serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are significantly higher (260-folds that 
of normal values) in patients who develop AKI after a Crotalus bite. Other markers of 
rhabdomyolysis, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are also increased in patients with AKI (Pinho et al., 
2005). High serum and urine levels of myoglobin are potentially nephrotoxic, leading to 
acute tubular necrosis, which is the primary and most serious complication of human 
crotalid envenomation. Tissue damage at the site of the bite has been reported to be minimal 
or absent, a feature that differentiates the South American rattlesnake from other species of 
Crotalus and from Bothrops envenomations. Spontaneous bleeding has only been rarely 
observed in human patients, despite the presence of blood incoagulability in some cases 
(Jorge &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1992). AKI is the main cause of death among patients surviving to the early 
effects of Crotalus snakebites. 

In a study of 100 cases of Crotalus bites, Pinho et al. (2005) showed that AKI develops within 
the first 24 to 48 hours after envenomation. Envenomed patients presented a significant 

85



 
Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

162 

reduction in glomerular filtration rate (estimated by the creatinine clearance). AKI patients 
also presented dark-brown urine and a fractional excretion of sodium significantly higher 
than the normal (Pinho et al., 2005). The major kidney pathological alteration is acute 
tubular necrosis, although interstitial nephritis has also been observed (Amaral et al., 1986; 
Azevedo-Marques et al., 1985) (Table 2). In this type of envenomation the occurrence of 
severe rhabdomyolysis is one of the more accepted explanations for the acute tubular 
necrosis. Other factors potentially associated with venom-induced AKI such as shock, 
hypotension and hemolysis are present in some cases, but have not been confirmed in 
Crotalus envenomation (Azevedo-Marques et al., 1987; Pinho et al., 2008). Despite of in vitro 
hemolytic activity of Crotalus venom, it was confirmed that in vivo C.d. terrificus 
envenomation causes myolysis rather than intravascular hemolysis (Azevedo-Marques et 
al., 1987). 

The prevalence of AKI associated with Crotalid envenomation ranges from 10 to 29 % and 
68 to 77 % of AKI patients require dialysis treatment. The mortality rate of Crotalus venom-
induced AKI ranges from 8 to 17 % (Amaral et al., 1986; Pinho et al., 2008; Silveira &amp;amp; 
Nishioka, 1992). Although most risk factors for AKI are very similar to those described for 
bothropic envenomation it was reported that early after Crotalus snakebite the plasma levels 
of CK (higher than 2,000 U/L) were associated with a 12-fold increase in the risk of 
developing AKI (Pinho et al., 2005). 

3.2 Brown spider envenomation 

Among arthropods, spider and scorpion bites are the most frequent and of medical care 
importance. Although the number of accidents with scorpions often overcome those with 
spiders, reports of AKI after human envenomation with scorpion are scarce (Abdulkader et 
al., 2008). One species of spider that can cause severe renal injury is the brown spider 
(Loxosceles genus). Spiders of the genus Loxosceles have a worldwide distribution, since they 
can live under variable conditions such as temperature ranging from 8 to 43°C and that 
they can stay long time intervals living without food or water (Hogan et al., 2004; 
Swanson and Vetter, 2006). In Brazil, seven species have been described, but some of them 
are the most frequently implicated in bites in humans, namely Loxosceles intermedia, L. 
gaucho and L. laeta. These spiders are commonly found inside the residences both in rural 
and urban areas. They are small, measuring between 8 and 15 mm of body length while 
their legs measure 8-30 mm. Their colour varies from a pale brown (L. laeta) to a dark 
brown (L. gaucho). Loxosceles spiders are not aggressive and the bites usually occur when 
they are pressed against the body, mainly while the victim is sleeping or dressing (da 
Silva et al., 2004).  

The venom has proteolytic, dermonecrotic, hemolytic and nephrotoxic activities (Isbister &amp;amp; 
Fan, 2011) (Table 2). The accident may have local and systemic manifestations that are 
exhibited in two different clinical forms: cutaneous and viscerocutaneous loxoscelism (da 
Silva et al., 2004). Most patients have only the local manifestation or cutaneous 
loxoscelism. In these cases, the accident may cause mild cutaneous inflammatory reaction 
or a local injury characterized by pain, edema and erithrema, later developing to 
dermonecrosis with gravitational spreading. In the minority of cases loxoscelism can 
cause a systemic injury or the viscerocutaneous loxoscelism. This form occurs

predominantly in children, and patients can develop AKI, which is considered the main 
cause of death after brown spider envenomation. Viscerocutaneous loxoscelism is 
characterized by fever, malaise, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hemolysis, hematuria, 
jaundice, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This severe 
multisystemic clinical picture can occur as early as 24 hours after the bite (Abdulkader et 
al., 2008; da Silva et al., 2004; Isbister &amp;amp; Fan, 2011).  

Analysis of 267 loxoscelism cases reported in Brazil showed that the viscerocutaneous form 
was diagnosed in 13.1 % of the cases, where L laeta was the main specie implicated in the 
accidents. The investigators reported jaundice in 68.6 %, oliguria in 45.7 %, anuria in 8.6 %, 
dark urine in 28.6 %, hemorrhage in 25.7 %, and shock in 2.9 % of the patients. AKI 
occurred in 6.4 % of the patients, and most of them were diagnosed more than 24 hours 
after the bite. Four patients died (1.5 %), all of them were children under 14 years old 
(Sezerino et al., 1998). The main factors likely associated with AKI development are 
hemolysis, hypotension/shock, and direct venom nephrotoxicity (Table 2). Pigment-
induced acute tubular necrosis was reported in human necropsies of viscerocutaneous 
loxoscelism (Zambrano et al., 2005). Thus, it was suggested that the pathological effect of 
the venom on the kidney may reflect hematological disturbances, such as intravascular 
hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Abdulkader et al., 2008). Although 
only low myotoxic activity has been reported in Loxosceles venom, rhabdomyolysis can also 
occur after envenomation. In this cases, high levels of  serum CK and deposits of 
myoglobin in tubular cells have been observed (França et al., 2002; Lucato-Junior et al., 
2011).  

3.3 Bee and wasp envenomation 

Stings of insects from the order Hymenoptera, which includes several species of bees, 
hornets, wasps and yellow jacks, have also been implicated in cases of human envenomation 
(Vetter et al., 1999). 

In general the victims present only local allergic reactions after one or a few stings. 
However, after a massive attack with hundreds or thousands of stings, a systemic 
envenomation may occur (Abdulkader et al., 2008). The majority of envenomation cases 
with medical importance is caused by the so-called Africanized bees (Apis genus). These 
bees are hybrids between bees of European origin (Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera 
ligustica) and African bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) which were originated by the 
introduction of different species in Brazil since 1957. Currently, due to the migratory 
behavior and a high reproductive rate they are found throughout South America, Central 
America and parts of North America. Because of their aggressive behavior and the number 
of accidents associated with them, the Africanized bees are also known as “killer bees” 
(Abdulkader et al., 2008; França et al., 1994). 

The main venom activities are hemolytic, myotoxic, cardiotoxic and nephrotoxic (Table 2). 
Clinical manifestations can be divided into allergic and systemic reactions. Allergic reactions 
usually are observed in patients with a history of previous bee stings or asthma or other 
hypersensitivity disease. These reactions occur immediately after a single sting and can lead 
to anaphylaxis and death by laryngeal edema. Systemic reactions usually occur after 
multiple stings and are characterized by pain, erythema, urticaria, release of histamine, 

87



 
Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

164 

nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, hypotension and shock (Abdulkader et al., 2008). 
Rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis can be detected a few hours after the accident (Chao et al., 
2004). Fatalities are typically the result of renal damage or from cardiac arrest due to 
complications of the venom toxicity (Vetter et al., 1999).  

AKI has been observed in cases of massive attacks with 150 stings to more than 1,500 stings. 
Envenomed patients commonly have anuria or oliguria, high levels of serum creatinine (10-
30 mg/dL) and CK (&gt;2,000 U/L), hypotension, tachycardia, myocardial damage and anemia 
(Daher et al., 2003; Gabriel et al., 2004; França et al., 1994; Xuan et al., 2010). Acute tubular 
necrosis is the main histologic finding in human beings, domestic dogs, and in experimental 
animals after bee and wasp envenomations. Allergic interstitial nephritis with concurrent 
pigment tubulopathy resulting from both hemoglobin and myoglobin has also been 
described after wasp stings (Chao et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2001) (Table 2). A direct 
nephrotoxicity of the venom and/or hypotension caused by anaphylactic reaction are also 
mechanisms implicated in AKI induced by bees of Apis genus (Grisotto et al., 2006). By 
analyzing five cases of severe envenomation by Africanized bees, França et al. (1994) found 
high venom concentrations in serum and urine which remain for more than 50 h after the 
stings in two fatal cases; in one of them the total circulating unbound whole venom 
components was estimated at 27 mg, one hour after the attack. Despite the treatment with 
dialysis, antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, vasodilators, bicarbonate, 
mannitol and mechanical ventilation, three out four patients died between 22 and 71 h after 
the attacks. However, in the majority of cases, the renal damage is usually reversible 
responding well to the dialysis. Complete recovery may require 3-6 weeks (Vetter et al., 
1999).  

3.4 Caterpillar envenomation 

The accidental contact with some lepidopteran caterpillars can also cause human 
envenomation cases that vary from simple skin irritation and local allergic reactions to a 
systemic disease characterized by renal damage and hemorrhagic disturbances (Pinto et al., 
2010; Veiga et al., 2009). From the medically important Saturniidae family, Lonomia genus 
has been attributed to cause human envenomations since late 1960’s in Venezuela (Arocha-
Piñango et al., 2000). In Southern Brazil, Lonomia obliqua caterpillar is becoming the most 
important venomous animal responsible for severe injuries, hemorrhagic disorders and 
often fatal outcome since the 1980’s (Duarte et al., 1990). For instance, in the State of Rio 
Grande do Sul, located in this Brazilian region, more than a thousand accidents have been 
registered in the period from 1997 to 2005 (Abella et al., 2006). In fact, based on data from 
the year 2009, the Brazilian Ministry of Health registered an incidence of 7.3 lepidopteran 
envenomations per 100,000 inhabitants in Southern Brazil (Boletim eletrônico 
epidemiológico, 2010) (Table 1). Actually, these numbers are greatly underestimated due to 
the fact that most accidents are occurring in distant rural areas, where the cases are poorly 
reported. Lonomia’s accidents usually occur when the victim, leaning against tree trunks 
containing dozens or hundreds of caterpillars, comes into contact with their bristles. These 
structures are hard and spiny evaginations of the cuticle, underneath which the toxins are 
stored. Often, the whole animal is smashed in the accident, the insect’s chitinous bristles get 
broken and the venomous secretions, including hemolymph, penetrate the human skin and 
enter the circulation (Veiga et al., 2001a). 

88

165 

The venom presents procoagulant, fibrinogenolytic, proteolytic and hemolytic activities 
(Table 2). Clinical symptoms of Lonomia envenomation include local pain (burning 
sensation) and inflammatory reaction, which starts immediately after contact; systemic 
reactions such as headache, fever, vomiting and asthenia, which appear a few hours after 
exposure; and bleeding diathesis characterized by hematomas and ecchymosis, gross 
hematuria, hematemesis, melena, pulmonary and intracerebral hemorrhage and AKI (Pinto 
et al., 2010). Intravascular hemolysis has also been described in human envenomation and 
experimental studies (Malaque et al., 2006; Seibert et al., 2004). The activation of blood 
coagulation, fibrinolysis and the systemic inhibition of platelet function are mechanisms that 
seem to contribute to the hemorrhagic syndrome commonly observed in Lonomia 
envenomation (Berger et al., 2010a). In human patients, this hemorrhagic syndrome 
manifests as a consumptive coagulopathy without thrombocytopenia (Berger et al., 2010a; 
Zannin et al., 2003). 

The incidence of AKI varies from 2 to 5 % of envenomation cases reported in the literature 
(Duarte et al., 1990; Gamborgi et al., 2006). Of the 2,067 patients evaluated in southern Brazil 
(period from 1989 to 2003), 39 (1.9 %) developed AKI (serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 mg/dL). 
Eleven (32 %) of these patients were treated with dialysis and four (10.3 %) developed 
chronic renal injury (CRI). All victims with AKI presented concomitantly coagulation 
disturbances and hematuria and/or hemoglobinuria. Seven deaths (4%) occurred during the 
period (Gamborgi et al., 2006). The impossibility of conducting early renal biopsies, due the 
coagulation disturbances inherent to the envenomation, has made it difficult to analyze the 
acute anatomopathological alterations. The few reports existing in the literature describe 
thickening of the Bowman’s capsule, focal tubular atrophy and acute tubular necrosis 
(Burdmann et al., 1996; Fan et al., 1998) (Table 2). Similarly, the contribution of other factors 
possibly associated with AKI, such as hypotension or glomerular fibrin deposition, remains 
still obscure in Lonomia envenomation. 

4. Toxins of snake and arthropod venoms and their role in the 
pathophysiology of acute kidney injury 

Animal venoms are mixtures of biologically active proteins and peptides, and also non-
protein toxins, carbohydrates, lipids, amines, and other small molecules. The clinical 
features of envenomation reflect the effects of these different venom components and thus, 
the contribution of the venom toxins to the pathophysiology of renal injury is complex and 
multifactorial (Sitprija, 2006).  

Based on the current knowledge, the hypothesis for pathogenesis of venom-induced AKI 
include both a direct cytotoxic action of the venom on different renal structures, and a 
secondary response of the whole organism resulting from systemic envenomation. The  
secondary response is usually triggered by inflammation, release of cytokines and 
vasoactive substances that leads to changes in renal function and hemodynamics (Fig. 1). In 
fact, there is an increase in plasma concentration of different cytokines and vasoactive 
substances such as TNF-?, interleukins, nitric oxide, histamine, bradykinin and eicosanoids 
following several types of envenomations (Petricevich et al., 2000). The elevation of 
cytokines are mainly due to accumulation of pro-inflammatory cells and immune system 
response. Together, all these mediators can impair renal function ultimately contributing to 

89

a decrease in renal perfusion pressure, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. As a 
result in association with the systemic hypotension (Table 2), there will be an inadequate 
tissue and cellular oxygen delivery which can generate an ischemic process. Since the 
intermediary metabolism and energy production have an absolute dependence on oxygen, 
and oxygen cannot be stored intracellularly, the inadequate oxygen availability rapidly 
leads to cellular dysfunction, injury, and cell death by necrosis (Deitch, 1992). Important 
contribution to venom-induced renal ischemia is also derived from the process of hemolysis, 
rhabdomyolysis and/or intravascular deposition of platelets and fibrin in the 
microcirculation (Table 2). The presence of hemoglobin and myoglobin also have a direct 
cytotoxic effect on renal tubules (Fig.1) (Khan, 2009; Zager, 1996). Thus, it seems that 
different, but interrelated processes may contribute to the nephrotoxicity and even to other 
pathological features observed in envenomed patients.

Recently, advances in molecular biology, proteomics and transcriptomics, facilitated the 
isolation of toxins and contributed significantly to the study of their mechanisms of action 
on renal tissue. In this subsection, we reviewed the renal physiopathological effects of snake 
and arthropod venoms and their main isolated toxins. Special emphasis was given to

experimental studies with venomous animals highly prevalent in Brazil and other regions of 
Latin America. As in the previous subsection the following animals were included: Bothrops 
and Crotalus snakes, the brown spider Loxosceles, africanized bees, wasps and the caterpillars 
of genus Lonomia.

4.1 Snake venoms 

4.1.1 Bothrops venom 

The venom of bothrops snakes can cause prominent local tissue damage usually 
characterized by swelling, blistering, hemorrhage and necrosis of skeletal muscle. Such local 
pathology is mostly due to the venom proteolytic action (Gutiérrez et al., 2006). Snake 
venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), phospholipases A2, , serine proteinases, esterases, L-
amino acid oxidases, hyaluronidases, C-type lectins-like and bradykinin-potentiating 
peptides (BPPs) are the main venom components that acts inducing cellular injury or 
releasing inflammatory and vasoactive mediators (Warrell, 2010). Transcriptomic and 
proteomic studies have showed that SVMPs and serine proteinases are the major toxins in 
the venom, which explained the high local damage and hemorrhage seen in envenomed 
patients (Table 2) (Cidade et al., 2006; Zelanis et al., 2010). Bothrops toxins are also known for 
their multiple effects on hemostasis. In fact, the venom have thrombin-like enzymes, factor 

91

X and prothrombin activators that are able to directly convert fibrinogen into fibrin (Berger 
et al., 2008; White, 2005). These actions produce intravascular coagulation and may lead to 
blood incoagulability by consumption coagulopathy. Systemic inhibition of platelet 
aggregation and thrombocytopenia are common (Rucavado et al., 2005; Santoro &amp;amp; Sano-
Martins, 2004). Moreover, anti-hemostatic principles, such as thrombin and platelet 
aggregation inhibitors, are also found in bothrops venoms (Kamiguti , 2005; Zingali et al., 
2005).    

Regarding renal function, Boer-Lima et al. (1999) observed that the intravenous injection of 
B. moojeni venom in rats, produced renal tubular disturbances including an increase in 
proximal and post-proximal fractional excretion of sodium associated with acute tubular 
necrosis. The glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly, despite the absence of 
systemic hypotension. Severe morphologic disturbances in the renal glomeruli also 
occurred. The changes included mesangiolysis, glomerular microaneurysms, and 
glomerular basement membrane abnormalities. In addition, there was a reduction in the 
number and width of podocyte pedicels, which caused a reduction in the number of 
filtration slits. The morphophysiological changes observed in experimental animals also 
correlated with the levels of proteinuria (Boer-Lima et al., 2002). Similar renal functional 
alterations were observed after intravenous injection of B. jararaca venom into rats. In these 
animals, differently of human envenomation, B. jararaca venom was not able to induce 
systemic hypotension but significantly reduced the renal plasma flow and increased renal 
vascular resistance (Burdmann et al., 1993). There was no increase in CK, indicating that 
rhabdomyolysis is not an important consequence of B. jararaca envenomation. However, the 
venom caused marked fibrinogen consumption and intravascular hemolysis. Indeed, kidney 
of rats and rabbits envenomed with B. jararaca showed an extensive intraglomerular 
deposition of fibrin and platelets (Burdmann et al., 1993; Santoro &amp;amp; Sano-Martins, 2004). 
Contrarily to the findings with B. jararaca venom, Boer-Lima et al. (1999) did not observed 
any glomerular fibrin deposition in the B. moojeni envenomation. They suggested that the 
glomerular injury is more likely to be related to structural disorganization of the glomerular 
capillary tuft, consequent to a direct action of the venom on the mesangial matrix, 
glomerular basement membrane and podocytes rather than to fibrin deposition in the 
capillaries. 

Studying the kinetic of renal distribution of injected B. alternatus venom in rats, Mello et al. 
(2010) detected the highest venom concentration in renal tissue 30 min post-venom injection. 
After this time, venom concentration decreased progressively. Venom components were 
also detected into urine 3, 6 and 24 h post-venom injection. By immunohistochemistry, 
venom proteins were detected in glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules, and vascular and 
perivascular tissue, suggesting that toxins bind to kidney structures where they probably 
exert a direct nephrotoxic action. In accordance to this observation, it was showed that B. 
alternatus venom is cytotoxic to canine renal epithelial cells (MDCK) in culture and causes 
extensive cytoskeletal alterations inducing impairment of the cell-matrix interaction 
(Nascimento et al., 2007). Additionally, it was described that B. jararaca venom also causes in 
vitro injury of isolated renal proximal tubules and that the B. moojeni venom increases cell 
release of lactate dehydrogenase and decreased cellular uptake of the vital neutral red in 
MDCK cells (de Castro et al., 2004; Collares-Buzato et al., 2002). Functionally, B. alternatus 
venom induced oliguria, urine acidification, decreased in glomerular filtration rate and 

92

169 

hematuria. Morphologically, the venom caused lobulation of the capillary tufts, dilation of 
Bowman's capsular space, disruption of renal tubule brush border, and fibrosis around 
glomeruli and proximal tubules that persisted 7 days after envenomation (Linardi et al., 
2011; Mello et al., 2010).    

Some purified Bothrops toxins are able to reproduce the renal effects obtained with whole 
venom. Studies on the isolated perfused rat kidney have shown that L-amino acid oxidase 
(Braga et al., 2008), C-type lectins (Braga et al., 2006), phospholipase A2 myotoxins (Barbosa 
et al., 2005; Evangelista et al., 2010) and thrombin-like enzyme (Braga et al., 2007) from 
Bothrops venoms can alter renal function. The isolated perfused kidney technique also 
confirmed the direct acute tubular nephrotoxicity of Bothrops venoms and showed that 
platelet activating factor might play a role in some renal functional disturbances such as the 
decreased in glomerular filtration rate (Monteiro and Fonteles, 1999). However, the systemic 
injection of baltergin, a purified metalloproteinase from B. alternatus venom, only mildly 
affected the kidney structure. At high doses, baltergin causes congestion, subcapsular 
hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate (Gay et al., 2009). There was no detection of tubular 
necrosis indicating that different toxins act synergistically to produce the AKI observed in 
animals treated with whole venom.  

4.1.2 Crotalus venom 

The venom of Crotalus rattlesnakes is a complex combination of different enzymes and toxic 
peptides that mainly display neurotoxic and myotoxic activities (Boldrini-França et al., 
2010). Toxins affecting hemostasis, such as thrombin-like enzymes and platelet activators are 
also found. The main protein families identified by proteomics included phospholipases A2, 
serine proteinases, cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP), vascular endothelial growth 
factor-like molecules (VEGF), L-amino acid oxidases, C-type lectins-like, and snake venom 
metalloproteinases (SVMP). Crotoxin, a neurotoxic phospholipase A2, represents more than 
60 % of the proteins in the whole venom and is the major component responsible for its 
neurotoxic and myotoxic effects (Boldrini-França et al., 2010). Additionally, crotoxin also 
exhibits cardiotoxic and direct nephrotoxic activities. Structurally, crotoxin is a 
heterodimeric ?-neurotoxin that consists of a toxic basic phospholipase A2 and a 
nonenzymatic, non-toxic acidic component (crotapotin). Crotapotin potentiates the activity 
of crotoxin, since it prevents the basic phospholipase subunit binding to non-specific sites 
(Sampaio et al., 2010; Soares et al., 2001). Crotoxin targets neuromuscular junctions and 
inhibits the release of acetylcholine, which leads to neuromuscular blockade and muscular 
and respiratory paralysis. In the muscle tissue, crotoxin causes selective injury of skeletal 
muscle groups composed of type I and IIa fibers, which are extremely vascularized and rich 
in myoglobin (Sampaio et al., 2010). Other important toxins are crotamine, convulxin and 
gyroxin. Crotamine is a toxic peptide with myonecrotic activity (Martins et al., 2002). 
Convulxin is a C-type lectin-like glycoprotein with high affinity to specific receptors in 
rabbit and human platelets. Convulxin binds to the putative collagen receptor glycoprotein 
VI (GPVI) and mediates platelet adhesion, aggregation and intracellular calcium 
mobilization (Francischetti et al., 1997). Gyroxin is a serine proteinase that displays several 
activities including the induction of blood coagulation (thrombin-like activity), vasodilation 
and neurotoxicity (Alves da Silva et al., 2011). 

93

Intraperitoneal injection of C.d. terrificus venom in mice increased plasma creatinine and uric 
acid and caused urinary hypoosmolality. When compared to control groups injected with 
saline, the incidence of hypercreatinemia and hyperuricemia (plasma values higher than 1.8 
mg/dL) occurred in 60 % and 100 % of the experimental animals, respectively (Yamasaki et 
al., 2008). Crotalus experimental envenomation was also associated with significant renal 
blood flow and glomerular filtration rate decreases and ischemia with consequent acute 
tubular necrosis. In isolated perfused rat kidneys treated with crude venom or crotoxin, a 
large amount of protein material was observed in the glomeruli, probably due to a direct 
toxic effect of the venom on the glomeruli and tubules and/or to an increase in vascular 
permeability (Monteiro et al., 2001). Prostaglandins and TNF-? release seems to be 
important since the treatment with indomethacin and pentoxifylline (inhibitors of 
cyclooxygenase and TNF-? synthesis, respectively) were able to blockade the renal effects 
induced by supernatant of macrophages activated with Crotalus venom (Martins et al., 2003; 
Martins et al., 2004). Among the main venom components, crotoxin was able to induce 
significant changes in glomerular filtration rate and electrolyte transport in isolated kidney. 
Gyroxin caused only mild alteration in renal parameters and convulxin had no effects 
(Martins et al., 2002). 

Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known cause of AKI and is commonly observed in envenomed 
patients and envenomed experimental animals. Myoglobin toxicity has been related to renal 
vasoconstriction, intraluminal cast formation and direct heme-protein cytotoxicity. 
Myoglobin can contribute to renal vasoconstriction by directly binding to nitric oxide (NO). 
Thus, acting as NO scavenging molecules, heme-proteins (including myoglobin or 
hemoglobin) lead to renal hypoperfusion, reductions in the storage of ATP, ischemia and 
tissue injury (Zager, 1996). Intraluminal casts are formed due to the precipitation of 
myoglobin inside the renal tubules, forming obstructive casts. Precipitated myoglobin also 
can be degraded resulting in the release of free iron and heme. Once released, free iron and 
heme contribute to renal injury by generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid 
peroxidation (Khan, 2009; Zager, 1996). Indeed, Yamasaki et al. (2008), showed an increase 
of oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH) in renal tissue during 
Crotalus envenomation. This data indicates a rise in the ROS generation by consumption of 
reduced glutathione (GSH) and production of oxidized glutathione (GSSH) which are the 
main antioxidant and oxido-reducing agents, respectively. Confirming the participation of 
ROS in Crotalus induced renal injury, envenomed animals treated with lipoic acid (an 
antioxidant molecule) had their GSSG/GSH ratios normalized when compared to control 
groups (Alegre et al., 2010). In addition to deleterious effects of obstructive myoglobin casts 
formation, the high levels of uric acid found in envenomed animals also contribute to 
tubular obstruction (Yamasaki et al., 2008). Marked hyperuricemia is known to cause AKI 
by supersaturation, crystallisation and deposition of crystals inside renal tubules (acute 
urate nephropathy). Moreover, experimental hyperuricemia causes renal vasoconstriction 
and soluble uric acid has been shown to inhibit endothelial NO bioavailability (Ejaz et al., 
2007). Recently, it was observed that systemic inhibition of uric acid synthesis, by 
allopurinol treatment, significantly reduced lethality rate, normalized GSSG/GSH ratio and 
ameliorate the renal histopathological changes. Thus, uric acid also seems to have an 
important role in renal pathophysiology of Crotalus envenomation (Frezzatti &amp;amp; Silveira, 
2011).

4.2 Loxosceles venom 

The bites of brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) led to several clinical manifestations such as 
necrotic skin degeneration and gravitational spread at the bite site, renal injury and 
hematological disturbances. Several studies concerning the structural and biological roles of 
various venom components have shown the complex nature of these venomous secretions. 
Likewise, the venom of Loxosceles spiders is a complex mixture of protein-based toxins with 
a molecular mass profile ranging from 5 to 40 kDa. The main components belong to the 
classes of phospholipases D (or dermonecrotic toxins), serine proteinases, venom allergens, 
hyaluronidases, astacin-like metalloproteinases and insecticidal peptides (Gremski et al., 
2010). Dermonecrotic toxins and astacin-like metalloproteinases are considered the major 
components responsible for the clinical profile observed in envenomed victims (Table 2) (da 
Silva et al., 2004). In fact, a transcriptomic study indicated that phospholipases D and 
astacin-like metalloproteinases represent 20.2 % and 22.6 % of total toxin-encoding 
transcripts, respectively. Other toxins also important to envenomation, such as serine 
proteinases, venom allergens and hyaluronidases represent the minority of encoding 
transcripts (Gremski et al., 2010).  

Among all the toxins found in Loxosceles spider venom, dermonecrotic toxin is undoubtedly 
the component most investigated and characterized. This toxin is able to reproduce the 
major biological effects induced by whole venom. It is involved with the development of 
dermonecrotic lesions and can trigger neutrophil migration, complement system activation, 
cytokine and chemokine release, platelet aggregation, lysis of red blood cells, among other 
effects (Abdulkader et al., 2008; da Silva et al., 2004). Dermonecrotic toxin comprises a 
family of toxins with different related isoforms that have biological, amino acid and 
immunological similarities which are found in several Loxosceles species. Only in L. 
intermedia venom, many isoforms were described being 9 out of them already expressed as 
recombinant proteins (Gremski et al., 2010). Loxosceles dermonecrotic toxins belong to 
phospholipases D (30–35 kDa) class of enzymes which was primarily designated as 
sphingomyelinases D due to their ability to convert sphingomyelin to choline and ceramide 
1-phosphate (N-acylsphingosine1-phosphate). As some Loxosceles sphingomyelinases D 
have broad substrate specificity, being able to hydrolyze not only sphingophospholipids but 
also lysoglycerophospholipids, they are now classified as phospholipases D (Lee and Lynch, 
2005). Due to sequence, structural and biochemical differences these toxins are grouped in 
two classes and their structures and substrate specificities have been recently elucidated (de 
Giuseppe et al., 2011; Murakami et al., 2005). Other important components of Loxosceles 
venom are the metalloproteinases. The enzymes have molecular weights ranging from 20 to 
35 kDa displaying gelatinolytic, fibronectinolytic and fibrinogenolytic activities. They are 
zinc endopeptidases homologous to the astacin family of metalloproteinases from the 
crayfish, Astacus astacus. The Loxosceles astacin-like metalloproteinases possess a digestive 
function used to initiate the degradation of prey molecules, facilitating the posterior 
ingestion process (Trevizan-Silva et al., 2010). Furthermore, these enzymes have an 
important role in the pathogenesis observed in envenomation, particularly inducing 
hemorrhage into the dermis, injury of blood vessels, imperfect platelet adhesion, and the 
defective wound healing observed in some cases. Likewise, these metalloproteases can also 
render tissue structures more permeable, facilitating other noxious toxins to spread 
throughout the body of victims (Veiga et al., 2000; Veiga et al., 2001b).

Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

172 

The nephrotoxic effect of the L. intermidia spider venom was demonstrated experimentally 
in mice exposed to the whole venom (Luciano et al., 2004). Histhopathological analysis 
showed morphological renal alterations including hyalinization of proximal and distal 
tubules, erythrocytes in Bowman’s space, glomerular collapse, tubule epithelial cell blebs 
and vacuoles, interstitial edema, and deposition of a protein-rich material inside the 
Bowman’s space and tubule lumen. Morphometric analysis showed that 75–80 % of the 
kidney area was affected by the venom and no glomerular or tubule leukocyte infiltration 
was described, suggesting that the involvement of inflammatory process is not important to 
renal injury in this type of envenomation. Despite the presence of erythrocytes and protein 
deposits in glomerular and tubular structures, no signs of intravascular hemolysis or 
hemoglobin were detected in envenomed animals. Supporting the evidence that L. intermidia 
venom has toxins with direct nephrotoxicity, confocal microscopy studies with antibodies 
against venom proteins were able to show direct binding of toxins to renal structures. 
Venom proteins were detected in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells and in renal 
basement membranes. Toxins with molecular weights of 30 kDa were also identified in renal 
tissue extracts by immunoblotting (Luciano et al., 2004). One of these venom proteins that 
can bind to the kidney tissue is the dermonecrotic toxin. Chaim et al. (2006), injecting the 
recombinant dermonecrotic toxin in mice, found glomerular edema and tubular necrosis 
without signs of inflammatory response. Additionally, the dermonecrotic toxin was detected 
in kidney tissue and induced changes in renal function such as urine alkalinization, 
hematuria and elevation of blood urea nitrogen levels. The treatment of renal epithelial cells 
(MDCK) with recombinant dermonecrotic toxin also caused morphological alterations 
and reduced the cell viability, confirming its direct citotoxicity (Chaim et al., 2006). Both 
effects upon renal structures in vivo and renal cells in vitro were dependent of the 
phospholipase D catalytic activity, since a mutated toxin without phospholipase activity 
showed no nephrotoxic effect (Kusma et al., 2008). Another mechanism involved in AKI 
induced by Loxosceles venom is the renal vasoconstriction and rhabdomyolysis. Recently, 
it was reported that L. gaucho caused a sharp and significant drop in glomerular filtration 
rate, renal blood flow and urinary output and increased renal vascular resistance in rats 
(Lucato-Júnior et al., 2011). In this model, the authors also found deposits of myoglobin in 
tubular cells and degenerative lesions indicative of an ischemic process (Lucato-Júnior et 
al., 2011).     

4.3 Bee and wasp venoms 

Bee and wasp venoms are composed of a mixture of proteins, peptides, and small 
molecules, which are related to different mechanisms of envenomation. In the Africanized 
bee (Apis mellifera) venom the most important components are melittin and phospholipase 
A2. Melittin is a highly toxic peptide and the most abundant component of bee venom 
comprising about 50 % of its dry weight. This peptide is able to disrupt biological 
membranes, producing many effects on living cells (Fletcher et al., 1993). Melittin has 
antibacterial activity, induces voltage-gated channel formation and can also produce 
micellization of phospholipids bilayers due to its membrane-interacting effect. This peptide 
is responsible for the direct hemolytic effect of Apis venom (Dempsey, 1990; Terra et al., 
2007). The enzyme phospholipase A2 represents approximately 11 % of whole venom and 
acts synergically with melittin. Once melittin has disrupted the membrane, phospholipase 

96



 
Acute Kidney Injury Induced by Snake and Arthropod Venoms 

 

173 

A2 cleaves bonds in the fatty acid portion of the bilipid membrane layer (Vetter et al., 1999; 
Lee et al., 2001). In association, melittin and phospholipase A2, can act on erythrocytes, 
myocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, mast cells, and leukocytes (Abdulkader et al., 2008; 
Fletcher et al., 1993; Habermann, 1972). Additionally, bee venom also has hyaluronidase (an 
enzyme that disrupts the hyaluronic acid in connective-tissue matrix), apamin (a 
neurotoxin), mast cell degranulating peptide (a peptide that releases histamine from mast 
cells) and other small molecules such as histamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Among 
all Apis mellifera venom components the main allergens are melittin, phospholipase A2 and 
hyaluronidase (Vetter et al., 1999). In wasp venoms the components are active amines 
(serotonin, histamine, tyramine, catecholamines); wasp kinins (similar in composition to 
bradykinin), which are mostly responsible for pain; and histamine-releasing peptides, which 
are responsible for the inflammatory response. The major allergens identified in wasp 
venoms are phospholipase A1, a hyaluronidase and a serine-protease (Pantera et al., 2003; 
Vetter et al., 1999).  

Despite the current knowledge on the composition of wasp venoms, little is known about 
the participation of its components, and even the whole venom, on the AKI observed in 
envenomed patients. On the other hand, the mechanisms of bee venom-induced AKI have 
been more explored in experimental models in vivo and in vitro. In the case of bee 
envenomation, the experimental injection of venom in rats caused a significant and early 
reduction in glomerular filtration rate and diuresis and an increase in plasma creatinine 
levels (dos Reis et al., 1997; Grisotto et al., 2006). Tubular alterations such as increased 
fractional sodium and potassium excretions and a reduced water transport through 
collecting tubules, were also described (dos Reis et al., 1997). The early glomerular filtration 
rate reduction was concomitant with marked cortical and medullary renal blood flow 
decrease (Grisotto et al., 2006). Neither hypertension and hypotension nor intravascular 
hemolysis were detected in experimental models. Despite of the absence of hemolysis, 
rhabdomyolysis was present with massive myoglobin deposition in the lumen of the tubules 
as well as into the tubular cells (dos Reis et al., 1997; Grisotto et al., 2006). The injection of 
purified melittin or phospholipase A2 also induced rhabdomyolysis, due to their capacity to 
disrupt the membranes of myocytes (Ownby et al., 1997). Additionally, in vitro studies have 
been demonstrated that bee venom is citotoxic to cultured isolated proximal tubule cells 
(Grisotto et al., 2006). Histological analysis showed acute tubular necrosis mainly in cortex 
and outer medulla, and cast formation in the distal and collecting tubules (dos Reis et al., 
1998). These degenerative lesions observed in AKI induced by the bee venom have been 
associated with the ischemic process induced by melittin, phospholipase A2 and histamine 
(Abdulkader et al., 2008; Grisotto et al., 2006). Indeed, melittin and phospholipase A2 may 
be related to impaired renal blood flow by causing direct vasoconstriction, smooth muscle 
cell contraction, increased renal renin secretion and release of vasoconstrictor eicosanoids 
and catecholamines. Histamine and the mast cell degranulating peptides present in the 
venom also play a role in renal blood flow decrease, since histamine can directly induce 
vascular changes (Cerne et al., 2010; Churchill et al., 1990).  

4.4 Lonomia venom 

Caterpillars of the species L. obliqua are well known in Southern Brazil by causing a severe 
hemorrhagic syndrome characterized by coagulation disorders, AKI and generalized 

97



 
Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

174 

hemorrhage. The venom is composed of several active principles, including procoagulant 
and fibrinolytic activities (Pinto et al., 2010). Even though many studies have been 
performed with toxic secretions from L. obliqua aiming a better elucidation of the 
hemorrhagic syndrome resulting from this envenomation, few active principles have been 
purified from the venom and fully characterized so far. Thus, most of the molecules 
identified in this caterpillar have been characterized as putative enzymes and other proteins 
based solely on cDNA and amino acid sequences obtained by transcriptomic and proteomic 
methods (Ricci-Silva et al., 2008; Veiga et al., 2005). Through these techniques, the major 
protein found in Lonomia is a biliverdin-binding protein of the lipocalin family, which is 
mainly concentrated in the bristles and plays an important role in the caterpillar’s 
camouflage behavior. Along with the lipocalin and other housekeeping proteins, L. obliqua’s 
integument, hemolymph and bristles produce and store a variety of active principles. 
Among these proteins, the most abundant ones are serine proteases and their inhibitors 
(serpins) in the integument, and serine proteases, kininogen and lectins in the bristles. 
Besides these molecules, cysteine proteinases, phospholipase A2, cystatins, Kazal-type 
inhibitors and other protease inhibitors are also found. Serine proteases are the most 
relevant protein family when considering their potential of interfering with blood 
coagulation. Moreover, serine proteases are an expressive group, representing 16.7 % and 25 
% of the clusters derived from tegument and bristle transcriptome, respectively (Veiga et al., 
2005). This protein group presents coagulation factors-like activities, so it is expected that 
these enzymes participate in the generation of thrombin, by activation of factor X and 
prothrombin (Berger et al., 2010a; Veiga et al., 2003), and in the activation of the fibrinolytic 
system, contributing directly and indirectly to fibrinogen degradation (Pinto et al., 2006) and 
resulting in the hemorrhagic disorder. In fact, proteases with fibrinogenolytic, prothrombin 
and factor X activating activities have been purified and characterized in this venom 
(Alvarez-Flores et al., 2006; Pinto et al., 2004; Reis et al., 2006). The phospholipase A2 
enzyme also has a function in envenomation. This enzyme was isolated and characterized 
as the major component responsible to the in vitro and in vivo hemolytic activity of L. 
obliqua venom (Seibert et al., 2004; Seibert et al., 2006). Additionally, the phospholipase A2 
seems to be involved in platelet aggregation inducing activity present in the venom 
(Berger et al., 2010b). Lectins, particularly c-type lectins, are a relatively well-studied 
group of proteins in snake venoms that may exert an additional function in hemostasis 
modulation by interacting with coagulations factors and/or platelet receptors. Three 
lectin clusters were found in the bristle cDNA library with homology to many snake 
venom lectins being then another important candidate contributing to the hemorrhagic 
disorder (Veiga et al., 2005). 

Although AKI is the leading cause of death in L. obliqua envenomation, the mechanisms 
involved in kidney disorders are poorly understood. In contrast to hemostatic disturbances, 
to date, there is no experimental studies describing the renal effects of L. obliqua venom. 
Current knowledge is based only on a few case reports in which hematuria, high levels of 
serum creatinine and acute tubular necrosis are described as the main features of L. obliqua 
induced AKI. Due to this lack of knowledge, nowadays we are focused on the investigation 
of the effects of L. obliqua venom on renal function in rats. Preliminary results, indicate that 
subcutaneous injection of L. obliqua bristle extract caused severe hematuria with the 
presence of intact erythrocytes and leukocytes in urinary sediment (Berger et al., 

98



 
Acute Kidney Injury Induced by Snake and Arthropod Venoms

unpublished data). Envenomed animals also show proteinuria and significant changes in 
glomerular filtration rate and tubular electrolytic transport (Berger et al., unpublished data). 
Currently, the contribution of intravascular coagulation, deposits of hemoglobin in renal 
tubules and hemodynamic changes are under investigation. 

5. Diagnosis and management of acute kidney injury in snake and arthropod 
envenomation 

The early intravenous administration of animal-derived antivenoms is the only specific 
treatment against snake and arthropod envenomations. Antivenoms are concentrated of 
immunoglobulins (usually pepsin-refined F(ab’)2 fragment of whole IgG) purified from the 
plasma of a horse or sheep that has been immunized with the venoms of one or more 
species of venomous animal (WHO, 2010a). The preparation of antivenoms is expensive and 
technically demanding. Around the world different manufacturers, which include public 
and private laboratories of diverse sizes and strengths, are able to produce the antivenoms 
(Gutiérrez et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2010). Some of them are small facilities, mostly located 
in public institutions, which manufacture for the needs of specific countries. Others are 
larger laboratories that manufacture and distribute antivenoms throughout various 
countries or regions. Although some countries or regions manufacture enough antivenom 
for their national and regional needs, as in Europe, USA, Brazil, Central America, Mexico, 
Australia, Thailand and Japan, in other parts of the world, specially in some regions of 
Africa, there are very few antivenom producers (Gutiérrez et al., 2010). In Brazil, three main 
Institutions are responsible for production of antivenoms: Instituto Butantan, Fundação 
Ezequiel Dias and Hospital Vital Brasil. The manufacture is government-subsidized and the 
antivenom is usually provided free to the patients. However, failures in the distribution of 
antivenoms to places where they are needed still contribute to the maintenance of high 
mortality rates (Table 1). In some instances, antivenoms are held in the main cities, where 
envenomations are rare, instead of being distributed to peripheral health clinics in rural 
areas where the accidents are frequent. This reflects defective distribution planning which is 
associated with a lack of coordination between those who understand the epidemiological 
pattern of the disease and those responsible for the antivenom distribution. Also, inadequate 
storage and transportation of antivenoms may result in physical destruction of vials and 
ampoules (e.g. by freezing of liquid antivenom) (WHO, 2010a). Besides the inadequate 
supply, distribution and accessibility to safe and effective antivenoms, another major issue is 
the lack of trained of health workers on how to use these products and how to conduct 
appropriate clinical management of medical emergencies. In fact, it is estimated that in 
Brazil in 2009, 37% of accidents with scorpions and 9% of accidents with spiders received 
inadequate treatment with antivenom, mainly because the health authorities are uninformed 
of the treatment protocols (Boletim eletrônico epidemiológico, 2010).   

The treatment with antivenom is indicated in moderate and severe cases when systemic 
signs of envenomation are observed. In general, patients with hemostatic abnormalities, 
neurotoxic signs, cardiovascular abnormalities, AKI, hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria 
should receive antivenom therapy (WHO, 2010a). In these cases the time elapsed between 
the occurrence of the accident and administration of a correct dose of antivenom is decisive 
for a sucessful therapy. It was demonstrated that the time interval between the accident and 

99



 
Renal Failure – The Facts 

 

176 

administration of the antivenom of more than 2 hours was associated with the development 
of AKI, as well as with the risk of death or permanent injuries after Bothrops and Crotalus 
envenomations (Otero et al., 2002; Pinho et al., 2005). Although the correct use of antivenom 
is an effective form of treatment, the sorotherapy is also associated with the occurrence of 
severe adverse effects. The most serious adverse effect is anaphylactic reactions. Clinical 
features such as urticaria, itching, fever, tachycardia, vomiting, abdominal colic, headache, 
bronchospasm, hypotension and angioedema have been described after antivenom 
treatment (Fan et al., 1999; Ministério da Saúde, 2001). The incidence of adverse effects 
depends on the quality, dose and speed of intravenous injection or infusion. With 
antivenoms of good quality profile, there is a low incidence (less than 10%) of generally mild 
adverse reactions, mostly urticaria and itching. However, for products containing 
contaminant proteins, the incidence of such reactions may be as high as 85 %, including 
potentially life-threatening systemic disturbances such as hypotension and bronchospasm 
(WHO, 2007). Thus the adverse effects are directly associated with lack of good 
manufacturing practices adopted by laboratories that manufacture antivenoms. Recently, in 
an attempt to improve the quality of antivenom production the WHO established the 
guidelines for production, control and regulation of snake antivenom immunoglobulins. 
These guidelines provide detailed information on the recommended steps for antivenom 
manufacture and control (WHO, 2010b).   

A number of additional interventions besides antivenom  may be necessary to restore renal 
function in patients who developed AKI. Special attention should be given to hypotension, 
shock, electrolyte balance and maintenance of an adequate state of hydration. An urinary 
flow of 30 to 40 mL/h/kg is recommended for adults and 1 to 3 mL/h/kg for children to 
prevent AKI after snake envenomations (Ministério da Saúde, 2001; Pinho et al., 2008). 
Patients presenting oliguria or anuria, despite of fluid administration, are usually treated 
with intravenous furosemide or mannitol (WHO, 2010a). In these cases, a higher urinary 
flow may decrease the expousure of tubular cells to venom components and myoglobin or 
hemoglobin, which result in injury attenuation and prevention of tubular lumen obstruction 
(Zager, 1996). Cases that are unresponsive to fluid intake and diuretics are referred to renal 
units for dialysis (Pinho et al., 2008). Early alkalinization of urine by sodium bicarbonate in 
patients with myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria is also recommended, because in the 
presence of acidic urine, myoglobin and uric acid precipitate and form obstructive cast 
(Khan, 2009). 

6. Conclusion 

Envenomation by different venomous snakes and arthropods is a neglected disease that 
afflicts the most impoverished inhabitants of rural areas in tropical developing countries. In 
this chapter, we reviewed some important aspects related to epidemiology, prevalence, 
clinical manifestations, pathophysiology and treatment of venom-induced AKI, which is one 
of the most significant and lethal effect of animal venoms. Despite of actual knowledge 
discussed here, several aspects involving the renal manifestations remain still unclear. Thus, 
further research are needed to cover the following key points: (i) biochemical composition of 
different animal venoms and their individual contribution to renal injury; (ii) renal 
pathological mechanisms induced by some specific venoms that are still unexplored; (iii)

discovery of new and more specific therapeutic alternatives to treat envenomation cases and 
(iv) improvement in the production, distribution and availability of the antivenoms 
currently used.

Abstract        

Background. Lonomia obliqua caterpillar envenomation causes acute kidney injury 

(AKI), which can be responsible for its deadly actions. This study evaluates the possible 

mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction. Methods. To 

characterize L. obliqua venom effects we subcutaneously injected rats and examined 

renal functional, morphological and biochemical parameters at several time points. We 

also performed discovery based proteomic analysis to measure protein expression to 

identify molecular pathways of renal disease. Results. L. obliqua envenomation causes 

acute tubular necrosis, which is associated with renal inflammation; formation of 

hematic casts, resulting from intravascular hemolysis; increase in vascular permeability 

and fibrosis. The dilation of Bowman’s space and glomerular tuft is related to fluid 

leakage and intra-glomerular fibrin deposition, respectively, since tissue factor 

procoagulant activity increases in the kidney. Systemic hypotension also contributes to 

these alterations and to the sudden loss of basic renal functions, including filtration and 

excretion capacities, urinary concentration and maintenance of fluid homeostasis. In 

addition, envenomed kidneys increases expression of proteins involved in cell stress, 

inflammation, tissue injury, heme-induced oxidative stress, coagulation and 

complement system activation. Finally, the localization of the venom in renal tissue 

agrees with morphological and functional alterations, suggesting also a direct 

nephrotoxic activity. Conclusions. Mechanisms of L. obliqua-induced AKI are complex 

involving mainly glomerular and tubular functional impairment and vascular alterations. 

General significance. These results are important to understand the mechanisms of 

renal injury and may suggest more efficient ways to prevent or attenuate the pathology 

of Lonomia's envenomation.

1. Introduction 

 Accidents caused by venomous animals (mainly snakes, spiders, scorpions, bees, 

wasps and caterpillars) are a costly and critically important public health problem. 

Despite of this, public health authorities, nationally and internationally, have given little 

attention to this problem worldwide (Warrell, 2010; Williams et al., 2010). 

Consequentially, the morbidity and mortality associated with envenomation cases 

produce a great impact on the population and healthcare systems. One of the most 

important and lethal effects of these animal venoms is nephrotoxicity and a broad 

clinical spectrum of renal function impairment has been reported in human and 

experimental models of envenomation (Sitprija, 2006; Berger et al., 2012). As kidneys 

are highly vascularized organs and have the ability to concentrate substances into urine 

they are particularly susceptible to venom toxins. The most common clinical renal 

manifestation seen in human patients is acute tubular necrosis, but all renal structures 

may be involved. Thus, the occurrences of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal 

cortical necrosis, mesangiolysis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, hematuria, 

hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria have also been described (Sitprija, 2006). 

 Lonomia obliqua caterpillars are well known in southern Brazil where they 

cause severe hemorrhagic syndrome characterized by perturbed coagulation, 

ecchymosis, acute kidney injury (AKI) and generalized hemorrhage. Since the 1980's 

there has been a considerable increase in the number of hemorrhagic incidents in rural 

areas of the southernmost Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and 

Paraná. The origin of this epidemic is not clear, but can be partially attributed to recent 

deforestation, as well as to a progressive reduction in the number of natural predators. 

Usually, accidents occur when the victim, unknowingly leans against a tree trunk 

containing hundreds of caterpillars and comes into contact with the caterpillar’s 

venomous bristles, which are chitinous evaginations of cuticule. Often, the caterpillar is 

crushed, the bristles are broken and venomous secretions, including hemolymph, 

penetrate the human skin (Veiga et al., 2001). The venom is composed of several active 

constituents with procoagulant, fibrinogenolytic, proteolytic and hemolytic activities 

(Pinto et al., 2010). Although consumptive coagulopathy secondary to intravascular 

disseminated coagulation is commonly observed in human and experimental animals, 

AKI is the leading cause of death from L. obliqua envenomation (Zannin et al., 2003; 

Gamborgi et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2010).

Early in the 1980's, the first registered cases of L. obliqua-induced hemorrhagic 

syndrome indicated that 18 % of envenomed patients had developed AKI. The mortality 

rate in these patients reached 50 % (Duarte et al., 1990; Duarte et al., 1994). However, a 

lower incidence (5.2 %) was observed in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul from 

1989 to 1995, when only 15 of 286 envenomed patients developed AKI (Duarte et al., 

1997). Another study analyzing a larger group of 2,067 envenomed patients in the Santa 

Catarina state in Brazil (from 1989 to 2003) reported that 39 victims (1.9 %) developed 

AKI (with serum creatinine levels ? 1.5 mg/dL). Eleven (32 %) of these patients were 

treated with dialysis and four (10.3 %) developed chronic renal injury (CRI). All 

victims with AKI presented concomitantly coagulation disturbances and hematuria 

and/or hemoglobinuria. Seven deaths (4 %) occurred during this period (Gamborgi et 

al., 2006). An important conclusion of this work is that, even after the introduction of 

antivenom therapy (with anti-lonomic serum) in 1995, there was no reduction in the 

incidence of AKI, despite the significant decrease in the number of deaths and patients 

who developed CRI (Gamborgi et al., 2006). In fact, recently we observe that 

antivenom treatment was able to reduce creatinine and urea levels of rats only if 

administered 2 h post venom injection. Serotherapy after 6 h of envenomation fails to 

neutralize the rising in biochemical markers of renal injury (Berger et al., 2013). Since 

the average time elapsed between the contact of a person with caterpillars and an 

appropriate medical care can vary from 19 to 37 h (Zannin et al., 2003), it seems 

imperative to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in venom-

induced AKI. It is clear that having such knowledge available it will then make possible 

to develop new efficient treatments in order to avoid or at least to reduce the 

progression of renal disease in Lonomia`s  and other kind of animal envenoming. 

 The risk of conducting early renal biopsies in human patients, due to coagulation 

disturbances inherent to the envenomation, has made it difficult to analyze the acute 

kidney pathological alterations. There are only two case reports in the literature 

describing alterations of Lonomia-induced AKI. The main findings were oliguria, high 

levels of serum creatinine, thickening of the Bowman’s capsule, focal tubular atrophy 

and acute tubular necrosis (Burdmann et al., 1996; Fan et al., 1998). Since no 

experimental studies were available until now, the contribution of several factors 

possibly associated with AKI, such as hemodynamic changes, vascular permeability 

alterations, hemolysis, tubular obstruction, glomerular fibrin deposition and even a 

direct venom nephrotoxicity, remain obscure in Lonomia-induced AKI.

 In an attempt to better understand the progression of renal disease commonly 

observed after the contact with L. obliqua caterpillars, we have focused on the action of 

venom in the kidney. Therefore, an experimental rat model was used in order to 

characterize changes in renal function, tubular hydroelectrolytic transport, 

histopathology and hemodynamics. 

 

2. Materials and Methods 

 

2.1 Reagents 

 Evans blue dye, purified coagulation factors (VII, IX and X) and molecular 

weight standards used in SDS-PAGE and western-blot were purchased from Sigma-

Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). Chromogenic substrate for factor Xa (S2222, Bz-Ile-

Glu-Gly-Arg-pNa) was obtained from Chromogenix (Milano, Italy). Ketamine and 

xylazine were from Syntec, São Paulo, Brazil. L. obliqua antivenom (antilonomic serum 

- ALS), provided by the Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil), was used as primary 

antibody for the detection of toxins in urine and renal tissue. ALS is a horse-derived 

concentrate of purified polyclonal antibodies (IgG) that had been raised against L. 

obliqua bristle extract (Rocha-Campos et al., 2001). Nonspecific background staining in 

immunohistochemical reactions was blocked using Ultra V Block reagent (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 

  

  2.2 Venom 

 L. obliqua caterpillars were kindly provided by the Centro de Informações 

Toxicológicas (CIT), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The specimens used in 

this study were collected in the cities of Bom Princípio and Progresso, both located in 

Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. L. obliqua venom was obtained by homogenizing the bristles 

in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, as previously described (Berger et al., 

2010). The venom obtained following this procedure was designated as Lonomia 

obliqua Bristle Extract (LOBE). The protein content of the LOBE samples was 

determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA) and the aliquots were stored 

at -80 °C prior to use. The total number of caterpillars used for bristle extract 

preparation was 124 specimens and the protein concentration of the LOBE samples was 

4.10 mg/mL. The total amount of venom extracted per caterpillar was 2.4 mg. All of the 

LOBE samples had similar in vitro pro-coagulant activities and the protein pattern for

each sample as monitored by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography (Pinto et 

al., 2006; Berger et al., 2010) were also similar. 

  

2.3 Ethical statements 

 All procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the 

Guiding Principles for the Use of Animals in Toxicology (International Society of 

Toxicology, http://www.toxicology.org) and the Brazilian College of Animal 

Experimentation (COBEA). The experimental protocol was approved by the ethical 

committee on research animal care of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, 

Brazil (register number 2008177/2009) and by the Institute's Animal Ethics Committee 

of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil (protocol 177/2008).  

 

2.4 Experimental protocol 

 

2.4.1 Animals 

 Adult male Wistar rats, weighing 250-300 g, were supplied by the central animal 

facility of our institution. They were housed in standard conditions within a temperature 

controlled room (22-23 ºC, on a 12 h light/dark cycle, with the lights on at 7:00 am) and 

had free access to water and food. 

 

2.4.2 Selection of the venom dose 

 The severity of the natural envenoming is related mainly to the number of 

caterpillars involved as well as to the intensity of the exposure, since the venom is 

present not only in the caterpillar’s bristles but also in their skin and hemolymph (Veiga 

et al., 2001). Considering that accidents with medical importance involves contact with 

a colony containing at least 40 to 50 caterpillars (Gamborgi et al., 2006) and that during 

venom extraction, after removal of all spicules, each caterpillar produces approximately 

2.4 mg of venom, the total amount of venom injected in an individual weighing 70 kg 

can reach up to 1.4 – 1.7 mg/kg. In fact, these doses were calculated based on an 

artificial method of venom extraction, in which the caterpillar’s bristle was macerated in 

a solution buffer. Thus, in a real envenomation situation the total amount of venom 

transferred is probably lower than the amount calculated. In an attempt to reproduce the 

clinical conditions observed in a real envenomation we selected doses of 1.0 and 1.5 

mg/kg injected subcutaneously into rats. These doses were also in accordance with the 

http://www.toxicology.org/

amount of venom used in other studies to induce coagulopathy and test the efficacy of 

antilonomic serum (Berger et al., 2010; Dias da Silva et al., 1996; Rocha-Campos et al., 

2001). 

 

2.4.3 Venom administration 

 To follow the time course of kidney pathophysiological alterations, we used an 

experimental model of envenomation in rats. For this purpose, animals were divided 

into three groups (n = 6/group): The control animals (CTRL) were injected 

subcutaneously (s.c.) with 100 µL of sterile PBS solution and the experimental animals 

received a s.c injection containing 1.0 mg or 1.5 mg of LOBE per kg of body weight in 

a final volume of 100 µL. Immediately after treatments, the animals were distributed 

individually into metabolic cages, allowing quantitative urine collections and 

measurement of water intake. At several time points post-venom injection (2, 6, 12, 24, 

48 and 96 h), blood, urine and kidneys were obtained for biochemical, histopathological 

and immunohistochemical analyses.  

 

2.5 Sample preparation 

 Blood was collected in conscious rats through the caudal vein in 1:10 (v/v) 3.8 

% trisodium citrate. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 min and 

stored at – 80 ºC prior to use. Urine samples were also centrifuged at 2500 x g for 5 min 

and the supernatants stored at the same conditions. After blood collection, animals from 

the different groups were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a mixture of 

ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Then, an intracardiac perfusion was 

performed through the left ventricle with PBS solution and a circulatory circuit was 

opened by an incision in the right atrium, to ensure the elimination of intravascular 

blood. Immediately after perfusion, kidneys were quickly removed. One of them was 

fixed for histological analysis and the other was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 

80 ºC for the measurement of tissue factor activity and proteomic analysis. 

      

2.6 Biochemical measurements 

 Urinary and plasma levels of creatinine, urinary ?-glutamyl transferase (?-GT) 

activity and proteinuria were determined by spectrophotometry (Turner SP-830 plus 

Barnstead, Dubuque, Iowa, USA) using commercially available kits (BioClin/Quibasa, 

Belo Horizonte, Brazil). Plasma and urinary concentrations of Na
+
 and K

+
 were

measured by flame photometry (CELM 180; Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil). 

Osmolality was determined in plasma and urine samples by cryoscopic osmometery 

using a Micro-Osmometer 3320 (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, Massachusetts, 

USA). Urine proteins were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis which was performed 

according to Laemmli (1970). Urine samples from animals of different times post-

venom injection were diluted (10 X) and aliquots of 10 µL were submitted to SDS-

PAGE on 8-20 % gradient gels under reducing conditions. Toxins excreted in urine 

were detected by Western-blot as previously described (Pinto et al., 2006). Aliquots 

containing 50 µg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF 

membranes. Toxins were recognized using as a primary antibody an equine anti-LOBE 

IgG (ALS) diluted 1:100 and as a secondary antibody a peroxidase-labeled anti-horse 

IgG diluted 1:1000. 

 

2.7 Renal function parameters 

 At the time intervals mentioned above the following renal function parameters 

were determined: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), osmolar clearance (Cosm), water free 

clearance (CH2O), fractional water excretion (FEH2O), fractional sodium excretion 

(FENa
+
) and fractional potassium excretion (FEK

+
). GFR (expressed as mL/min/100 g of 

body weight) was estimated by the creatinine clearance (Ccr), using the standard 

formula: Ccr = Ucr.V/Pcr, where Ucr is the urinary creatinine concentration, V is the 

urinary output and Pcr is the plasma creatinine concentration. Cosm (expressed as 

mL/min) was calculated as Cosm = Uosm/Posm.V, whereas Uosm and Posm are the urinary 

and plasma osmolalities, respectively. Values of CH2O (mL/min) and FEH2O (%) were 

obtained respectively from the equations: CH2O = V - Cosm and FEH2O = V/GFR.100. 

FENa
+

 and FEK
+
 (expressed as %) were calculated according to the equation: FE = 

UE/PF.100. UE represents the urinary excretion of each ion and PF is the amount 

filtered in plasma (both expressed as nmol/min). 

 

2.8 Hemodynamic parameters 

 Systemic arterial pressure was measured in conscious rats by an indirect tail-cuff 

method using an electrosphygmomanometer (LE 5001, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, 

Massachusetts, USA) combined with a pneumatic pulse transducer/amplifier, which 

provides output signals proportional to cuff pressure and amplified Korotkoff sounds.

Three consecutive readings of mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded 

before blood collection for each animal in each time post-venom injection. 

 

2.9 Renal vascular permeability 

 The extravasation of Evans blue dye into the kidney was used as an index of 

increased vascular permeability (Pompermayer et al., 2005). Rats received Evans blue 

dye (30 mg/kg) intravenously (1 mL/kg) via caudal vein 10 min prior to LOBE (1.5 

mg/kg, s.c.) or PBS (100 µL, s.c.) injection. After 12 or 24 h, animals were anesthetized 

and perfused as described above to remove the intravascular Evans Blue. Then, the 

kidneys were quickly removed, weighed and allowed to dry for 24 h at 40 
o
C. The dry 

weight was determined and Evans blue dye extracted in 2.5 mL of 1 % formamide (48 h 

at 40 
o
C). The absorbance of extracted solution was measured in triplicate using a 

microplate reader spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX, Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, 

USA) and the amounts of Evans blue dye were calculated by a standard curve made 

with known concentrations of Evans Blue. Results are presented as the amount of Evans 

blue dye extravasated (?g) per 100 mg of kidney tissue. 

 

2.10 Renal tissue factor activity 

 Renal tissue factor (TF) was measured indirectly based on its ability to form a 

complex with factor VIIa (TF/FVIIa) to activate factor IX and X (Morrissey, 1995). 

Briefly, the kidneys were collected as described above, homogenized in cold PBS 

solution containing 1 % Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 9500 x g for 15 min. Samples 

of supernatants (with 10 µg of protein) were incubated with a concentrate mixture of 

FVII+FIX+FX (total of 15 µg) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM of CaCl2 

for 10 min at 37 
o
C. Activated factor Xa (FXa) produced during the reaction was 

detected by the addition of a specific chromogenic substrate (0.2 mM S2222). The 

kinetics of p-nitroaniline release was monitored at 405 nm for 30 min in a final volume 

of 100 µL using a microplate reader spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX, Molecular 

Devices Co., Sunnyvale, USA). Each sample was measured in triplicate and results 

expressed as µmol of FXa generated per min per mg of kidney tissue.

2.11 Histology and immunohistochemistry 

 For renal histopathology, kidneys were collected as described above, sectioned 

sagitally and fixed in 10 % buffered formaldehyde, pH 7.2. After processing in alcohol 

and xylol, the organs were included in paraffin and 4 ?m thick sections were obtained 

and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Picro-

Sirius reagent. 

 For immunohistochemical analysis of venom distribution in renal tissue, the 

kidney sections were deparaffinized and treated with 10 % hydrogen peroxide solution 

in methanol for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Nonspecific binding 

sites were blocked with Ultra V Block reagent followed by incubation overnight at 4 
o
C 

with an equine anti-LOBE IgG (ALS) diluted 1:250 in PBS. After a washing step, the 

sections were incubated with the secondary antibody (a biotinylated anti-horse IgG 

produced in goat, diluted 1:100) and streptavidin diluted 1:100. The chromogenic 

reaction was developed by incubating the sections with 0.05 % diaminobenzidine 

solution and 0.2 % hydrogen peroxide. The progress of the reaction was monitored by 

light microscopy and stopped by washing the slides. Finally, the sections were 

counterstained with diluted Harris’s haematoxylin. Control reactions were done by 

incubating kidney sections from non-envenomed rats with equine anti-LOBE IgG 

(ALS) under the same conditions as described above. No positive reactions were 

observed in these sections. Some sections were also used as negative controls. In these 

cases, the primary antibody was substituted by PBS. 

 

2.12 Morphometric analysis 

 Glomerular morphological alterations were quantified by computer-assisted 

morphometric analysis using a method previously described (Caliari, 1997). Briefly, 

images with 40 X magnification of 30 glomeruli from each animal of different groups 

were randomly digitalized using a JVC TK1270/RGB microcamera (Tokyo, Japan). The 

KS300 software coupled to a Carl Zeiss image analyzer (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, 

Germany) was used to measure the total area (?m
2
) of each glomerulus, glomerular tuft 

and bowman's space. The pixels of whole glomerulus and those corresponding to the 

glomerular tuft were selected and used for the generation of a binary image and 

subsequent calculation of the corresponding areas. The area of Bowman's space was 

obtained by the difference between the whole glomerular area and tuft area. The regions

of positive immunohistochemical reaction (expressed as ?m
2
) were also measured and 

used as a parameter to quantify venom distribution in the renal tissue. 

 

2.13 Renal tissue proteomics 

 

2.13.1 Sample preparation for mass spectrometry 

 The kidneys from controls and envenomed animals (at 24 h post-venom 

injection) were collected as described above, homogenized in cold PBS solution 

containing 1 % Triton X-100 with protease inhibitor cocktail (Halt protease inhibitor 

cocktail, Thermo, Rockford, USA) and centrifuged at 9500 x g for 15 min. The resulting 

supernatants were completely lyophilized and stored at -80 
o
C until use. Lyophilized 

samples were resuspended in water and precipitated using methanol/chloroform 

protocol. After precipitation samples were dried at room temperature and resuspended 

in 8 M urea. Each sample containing 100 µg of protein was reduced with 5 mM tris-2-

carboxyethyl-phosphine (TCEP) at room temperature for 20 min and alkylated with 10 

mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. After reduction and 

alkylation, proteins were digested with 2 ?g of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) by 

incubation at 37 °C during 16 h. Samples were freeze-dried at -80 
o
C and, after thaw, 

formic acid to a final concentration of 5 % was added. Samples were centrifuged at 

14,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C. 

 

2.13.2 MudPIT 

 The protein digest was pressure-loaded into a 250-?m i.d capillary packed with 

2.5 cm of 5-µm Luna strong cation exchanger (SCX) (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) followed 

by 2 cm of 3-µm Aqua C18 reversed phase (RP) (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA) with a 1 

µm frit. The column was washed with buffer containing 95 % water, 5 % acetonitrile, 

and 0.1 % formic acid. After washing, a 100-µm i.d. capillary with a 5-µm pulled tip 

packed with 11 cm of 3-µm Aqua C18 resin (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA) was attached 

via a union according Klein et al. (2012). The entire split-column was placed in line 

with an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC (Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed using a modified 

11-step separation as described previously (Washburn et al., 2001). The buffer solutions 

used were 5 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid (Buffer A), 80 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % 

formic acid (Buffer B), and 500 mM ammonium acetate, 5 % acetonitrile and 0.1 % 

formic acid (Buffer C). Step 1 consisted of a 70-min gradient from 0–100 % (vol/vol)

123 

 

buffer B. Steps 2–10 had a similar profile with the following changes: 5-min in 100 % 

(vol/vol) buffer A, 3-min in X % (vol/vol) buffer C, a 6-min gradient from 0 to 15 % 

(vol/vol) buffer B, and a 85-min gradient from 15–100 % (vol/vol) buffer B. The 3-min 

buffer C percentages (X) were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 % (vol/vol), 

respectively, for the 10-step analysis.  

 

2.13.3 LTQ-Orbitrap 

 As peptides eluted from the microcapillary column, they were electrosprayed 

directly into a LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) with the application of a distal 2.4-kV 

spray voltage. Full MS spectra were acquired in profile mode, with a mass range of 400 

– 1600 in the Orbitrap analyzer with resolution set at 60,000 followed by 10 data-

dependent MS/MS spectra at 35 % normalized collision energy was repeated 

continuously throughout each step of the multidimensional separation. Minimal signal 

for fragmentation was set to 1,000. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count 

of 1, duration of 30.00 s, list size of 500, exclusion duration of 180.00 s, and exclusion 

mass with high/low of 1.5 m/z. Application of mass spectrometer scan functions and 

HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system.  

 

2.13.4 Analysis of tandem mass spectra  

 MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the following software analysis protocol. 

Protein identification and quantification analysis were done with Integrated Proteomics 

Pipeline (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc. 

www.integratedproteomics.com/). Tandem mass spectra were extracted into ms2 files 

from raw files using RawExtract 1.9.9 (McDonald et al., 2004) and were searched using 

ProLuCID algorithm (Xu et al., 2006). MS/MS spectra remaining after filtering were 

searched with the ProLuCID algorithm against the EBI-IPI_rat_3.30_06-28-2007 

concatenated to a decoy data base in which the sequence for each entry in the original 

data base was reversed (Peng et al., 2003). Searches were performed with cysteine 

carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. ProLuCID results were assembled and 

filtered using the DTASelect program (Tabb et al., 2002) using two SEQUEST (Eng et 

al. 1994) defined parameters: the cross-correlation score (XCorr) and normalized 

difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCN) to achieve a false discovery rate of 1 

%. The following parameters were used to filter the peptide candidates: -p 1 -y 1 --

trypstat --fpf 0.01 --dm. Also, we used 50 ppm as precursor tolerance, fragment mass

tolerance of 600ppm, 3 as number of isotopic peaks and unlimited missed cleavages 

were allowed.  

2.13.5 Assessing differential expression and exclusive proteins / Bioinformatic tools 

 The software PatternLab (Carvalho et al. 2008, 2012) was used to identify 

exclusive proteins found in the control and treated conditions. PatternLab’s 

Approximately Area Proportional Venn Diagram (AAPVD) module was used for 

pinpointing proteins uniquely identified in each condition. The following parameter was 

used: proteins that were not detected in at least 2 out of 3 runs per condition were not 

considered. G-test spectral counting quantitation was performed in a pair-wise 

comparison between the two groups, as previously reported (Ambatipudi et al. 2009). 

Proteins are considered differentially expressed with P &amp;lt;0.1. Ingenuity Pathway 

Analysis tool (Ingenuity Systems; http://www.ingenuity.com) was used to generate 

functional annotations of identified proteins in known molecular pathways and/or 

biologic function in disease. The significance of the canonical pathways and biologic 

function defined by identified proteins was measured in two ways: (1) The number of 

proteins identified from the data set that map to a known pathway or function in disease 

and (2) a P value (Fisher exact test) determining the probability that the association 

between the proteins in the data set and the canonical pathway or function in disease is 

explained by chance alone. 

 

2.14 Statistical Analyses 

 Results are expressed as mean ± SE. When appropriate, statistical comparisons 

were done by using one or two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni's 

test. A P value of less than 0.05 was chosen to establish significance. Statistical analysis 

was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 

 

3. Results 

 

3.1 Renal function  

 To follow renal alterations in rats several physiological parameters were 

measured at different times post Lonomia obliqua venom injection. The results are 

presented in Fig. 1. Between 2 and 6 h after LOBE administration (doses of 1 mg/kg or 

1.5 mg/kg, s.c.), the animals showed signs of acute toxicity, including progressive 

weakness, lethargy and dyspnea. Compared to PBS-treated animals there was a 



Resultados 

125 

 

reduction of body weight mainly at 6 h in rats that received the higher dose of LOBE 

(1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) (Fig. 1A). The weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction 

in water intake between 6 and 48 h and by an increase in urinary output at 6 and 12 h for 

both tested doses (Fig. 1B). The polyuria was maximal at 6 h, when urinary output 

increased from 0.58 ± 0.08 mL/2h in PBS-treated animals to 1.80 ± 0.16 mL/2 h (p &amp;lt;

0.05) in rats injected with LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.). At the same time, animals that 

received a dose of 1.0 mg/kg had a urinary output significantly lower (0.9 ± 0.2 mL/2h, 

p &amp;lt;0.05) compared to those treated with 1.5 mg/kg (Fig. 1C).       

 Important glomerular and tubular functions related to control of fluid filtration, 

water and electrolyte balance were severely impaired. Despite the polyuria, L. obliqua-

induced AKI is associated with a marked reduction in the glomerular filtration rate 

(GFR). In the first 24 h of envenomation, a rapid decrease of GFR was observed in 

animals treated with both doses of LOBE. At 48 h envenomed rats (injected with 1.5 

mg/kg of LOBE) presented values of GFR 16 times lower than controls at the same 

time. This remarkable effect of the venom on GFR was observed for as long as 96 hours 

(Fig. 1D). Similarly, the kidney's ability to concentrate urine (a primordial tubular 

function) was also impaired, since the density and osmolality of urine had a reduction in 

values between 2 and 48 h (Fig. 1E an F). The decrease in urinary osmolality was 

accompanied by a significant increase in the plasma osmolality observed mainly in rats 

injected with the higher dose of LOBE (Fig. 1G). Consistent with these results the 

osmolar clearance (Cosm) was lower in envenomed animals, while the free water 

clearance (CH2O) increased, which imply that the kidney is producing dilute urine 

through the excretion of solute-free water (Fig. 1H and I). As expected, with the loss of 

ability to retain water, the fractional excretion of water (FEH2O) increased from 0.33 ± 

0.03 % in PBS-treated animals to 29.1 ± 4.9 % (p &amp;lt;0.05) in rats injected with LOBE 

(1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) at 48 h (Fig. 1J). Likewise, tubular ability to conserve and maintain the 

electrolytic balance was lost throughout the envenoming period. The fractional 

excretion of sodium and potassium (FENa+ and FEK+) was high between 24 and 48 h, 

indicating a marked impairment in the tubular reabsorption of filtered Na
+
 and K

+
 (Fig. 

1K and L). At 96 h most of the renal function parameters (excepting GFR) tends to 

return to normal levels (similar from that obtained to non-envenomed rats).

3.2 Proteinuria 

 Most of envenomed animals produced dark-brown-colored urine in the period of 

6 to 12 h, indicating the occurrence of hematuria and/or hemoglobinuria. The presence 

of intact and fragmented erythrocytes, epithelial cells and leukocytes were observed in 

the urinary sediment by light microscopy (not shown). Consistent with these 

observations, L. obliqua venom induced massive acute proteinuria, which was maximal 

at 6 and 12 h post-venom injection (Fig. 2A). As expected, the group treated with 1.5 

mg/kg of LOBE had more severe proteinuria compared to animals treated with 1.0 

mg/kg, but for both groups, urinary protein excretion decreased progressively between 

12 and 48 h, reaching levels similar to controls at 96 h. Analysis of urine by SDS-PAGE 

revealed the presence of several proteins with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 75 

kDa (Fig. 2B). A greater variety of bands were evident mainly at 6 and 12 h after 

envenomation, confirming this time interval as crucial to the development of glomerular 

injury. The two most prominent bands (observed around of 70 and 15 kDa) have 

molecular weights that match to serum albumin (68 kDa) and subunits of hemoglobin 

(16 kDa). The presence of venom excreted in urine was verified by western-blot. As 

shown in Fig. 2C, we detected at least 5 bands in urine from venom-treated rats at 6 and 

12 h, which specifically react with antibodies raised against L. obliqua toxic proteins. 

These bands have molecular weights around of 70-60, 50, 37, 25 and 20 kDa (arrows in 

Fig. 2C) and were not recognized in urine from non-envenomed animals (controls). 

Several toxins in this range of molecular weights have already been identified through 

transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of LOBE. Some of them include lectins and c-

type lectin-like proteins (70-60 kDa), serine-proteinases (50 kDa), cysteine-proteinases 

(37 kDa) and lipocalins (25-20 kDa) (Ricci-Silva et al., 2008; Veiga et al., 2005).  

    

3.3 Renal histopathological alterations 

 Light microscopy of kidney biopsies from PBS-injected rats revealed a normal 

renal parenchyma (Fig. 3A). In contrast, envenomed animals showed progressive 

degenerative lesions compatible with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (Fig. 3B–H). 

Increased acidophilia and dilation of renal tubules were observed between 6 and 48 h 

after venom administration (Fig. 3C-F). Loss of proximal brush border, cytoplasm 

vacuolation, and in some tubules, degeneration and desquamation of necrotic cells 

occurred between 12 and 48 h (Fig. 3D-F). The nuclei of the various proximal tubular 

cells at 24 and 48 h often showed pyknosis with clumping of chromatin material (Fig. 



Resultados 

127 

 

3E and F). In several tubules at 48 h, the renal epithelium was completely necrotic 

whereas the basement membrane was either intact or disrupted by tubular necrosis (Fig. 

3F). Consistent with the histological signs of tubular injury, ?-GT urinary activity ? 

which is considered an efficient biomarker for early diagnosis of ATN (Guder and Ross, 

1984) ? increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner up to 48 h. At 96 h, ?-GT 

activity decreased, but remained significantly high in animals treated with 1.5 mg/kg of 

LOBE. Histologically, the signs of lesions were much less marked and the proximal and 

post-proximal tubular epithelia assumed a normal appearance at 96 h (Fig. 3G and H).  

 Besides the evidence of degenerative lesions, proximal and distal tubules also 

had swollen lumens. Hyaline and hematic casts and cellular debris were found within 

tubules, obstructing their lumens (Figs. 3C-F and 4). Hyaline casts (predominantly 

formed by a protein-rich material) were more prevalent at 6 and 12 h (Figs. 3C-D and 

4A), while hematic casts (predominantly formed by fragmented or intact erythrocytes) 

and cellular debris have appeared commonly at 12, 24 and 48 h (Figs. 3D-F and 4A-B).  

 An intense inflammatory response characterized by edema, cellular infiltration 

and fibrosis was observed mainly at 48 h and 96 h (Figs. 3F and 5). Inflammatory cell 

infiltrate and edema were detected at 48 h in regions of extensive necrosis (Fig. 3F) and 

within glomeruli (Fig. 5C). At 96 h, despite signs of tubular regeneration, the 

inflammatory infiltrate increased significantly, probably to help in tissue repair (Fig. 

5B). Light microscopy of sections stained with picrosirius revealed extensive 

peritubular collagen deposition at 96 h after administration of L. obliqua venom (Fig. 

5E) compared to PBS-treated rats (Fig. 5D), indicating fibrosis. Foci of interglomerular 

collagen deposition were also observed in the renal cortex at the same time (Fig. 5F). 

 

3.4 Glomerular morphometric alterations and renal tissue factor activity 

 Glomerular alterations in envenomed animals were associated with lobulation of 

the capillary tufts, dilation of glomeruli, deposition of a hyaline material inside the 

Bowman's space and distention of Bowman's space (Figs. 3D, 6A and 7B). Nodules 

that formed a dense, strongly-stained mesangial matrix, evidenced by the presence of a 

PAS positive stain in the capillary tufts was also observed between 2 and 12 h post-

venom (Fig. 6A). Consistent with histological observations, computer-assisted 

morphometric analysis has indicated a significant increase in glomerular area at all-time 

intervals examined. There was also an increase in the areas of glomerular tuft and 

Bowman's space, which confirms that the capillaries and Bowman's space are dilated 



Resultados 

128 

 

(Fig. 6B). The enlargement of Bowman's space observed at 12 h possibly is related to 

the presence of a hyaline material (rich in plasma proteins) found in several glomeruli at 

this time (details in Figs 3D and 7B).    

 Since intra-glomerular fibrin deposition can impair renal function and L. obliqua 

venom is able to activate the coagulation system both in vitro and in vivo (Berger et al., 

2010), we decide to measure the levels of renal tissue factor (TF) activity during 

envenomation. TF is a transmembrane enzyme activator that triggers the coagulation 

cascade, generating activated factor X and fibrin. As showed in Fig. 6C, renal TF 

activity increased rapidly from the first 2 h, reaching levels 2 times higher than control 

values at 6 hours. At 12 and 24 h post-venom injection this level remained significantly 

high, but decreased progressively thereafter (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the rise in renal TF 

activity was coincident with the presence of PAS positive deposits (which stain 

specifically glycoproteins) within the capillary tufts at 2-12 h (Fig. 6A). 

 

3.5 Hemodynamics and renal vascular permeability  

 Mean arterial blood pressure was lower in animals that received LOBE 

compared to basal levels in controls (Table 1). Sustained hypotension was detected 

between 24 and 96 h in rats treated with the both doses of venom. The maximum 

decrease occurred at 24 h. In contrast, the heart rate increased significantly at 12 and 96 

h in animals injected with 1 mg/kg of LOBE and at 48 h in animals injected with 1.5 

mg/kg. Hypotension was accompanied by an increase in renal vascular permeability 

(Fig. 7). Kidney blood vessels were hyperemic and signs of plasma leakage, migration 

of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema were also evident after 12 h of venom 

administration (Fig. 7A). As mentioned above, several glomeruli at 12 h have their 

Bowman's space filled with a protein-rich material that had extravasated from 

glomerular capillaries (Fig. 7B). Confirming these observations, a marked increase of 

vascular permeability in the kidney, as measured by the extravasation of Evans blue 

dye, was detected at 12 and 24 h after LOBE injection (1.5 mg/kg, s.c) (Fig. 7C). 

 

3.6 Immunohistochemical detection of venom in the renal tissue 

 Venom distribution and its binding to renal structures was investigated by 

submitting kidney biopsies from venom-treated and control rats to 

immunohistochemistry using anti-LOBE IgG that reacts specifically with venom toxins 

(Fig. 8). Positive immunohistochemical reaction was found in cortical and medullar 



Resultados 

129 

 

regions of kidneys from rats injected with 1.5 mg/kg of LOBE (Fig. 8D and C). Venom 

was detected in glomerular capillaries, Bowman’s capsule, proximal and distal tubules 

and in intra-tubular casts. Staining for venom was intense in tubular brush border at 2 

and 6 h and was also present in cells of tubules in degeneration at 48 h (Fig. 8B-D). 

Generally, tubules stained more than glomeruli. There was no immunoreactivity for 

venom in the renal structures of PBS-treated rats (controls) (Fig. 8A). The highest levels 

of venom (estimated by the area of positive immunohistochemical reaction) were 

detected in the renal tissue at 2 h (Fig. 8F). After that, venom immunoreactivity 

decreased progressively until 96 h when the staining was weak (Fig. 8E and F). L. 

obliqua toxins were also detected in other kidney structures such as in perivascular 

connective tissue of blood vessels, endothelium and smooth muscle of arteries and veins 

(Fig. 9A and B). 

 

3.7 Kidney proteins differentially expressed during envenomation 

 To gain further mechanistic insight which drive venom-induced kidney disease, 

we applied a semi-quantitative discovery based shotgun proteomic approach to identify 

the proteins differentially expressed in the kidney of envenomed animals. For this 

purpose, the proteomic data was acquired by tandem mass spectrometry with 

subsequent quantification, analysis of differential protein expression, validation, and 

functional annotations in order to identify the involved molecular pathways. The 

proteins identified consist of two classes: (1) those that were differentially expressed 

and met our significance criteria and (2) proteins that were uniquely identified in 

kidneys of rats injected with PBS or LOBE (1.5 mg/kg) after 24h. Figure 10A 

represents differentially expressed and unique proteins via a Venn diagram. Overlaps 

between PBS- and LOBE-treated animals represent significant differentially expressed 

proteins and non-overlapping portions of the diagram represent unique protein 

identifications. A total of 779 proteins were identified. Twenty-four proteins were 

exclusively identified in envenomed animals; 169 were exclusively identified in control 

rats and 586 were common proteins in both treatments. Among these 586 proteins, 138 

(23.5 %) were identified as being differentially expressed. 

 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for functional annotations and revealed 

several key protein categories and pathways significantly enriched in the differentially 

expressed proteins. Thus, the sets of proteins were assigned to either biologic function 

in disease or canonical signaling pathways. Through these analyses it was evident that 



Resultados 

130 

 

the set of proteins identified in control kidneys displayed healthy biological functions 

such amino acid metabolism and small-molecule biochemistry associated with normal 

renal metabolic pathways (Fig. 10B). On the other hand, protein expression shifts 

toward "cellular distress" functions in the kidney of envenomed rats (Fig. 10C). In this 

case, the expression profiles were considerably enriched for proteins that belong to 

acute phase inflammatory response signaling, LXR/RXR activation (involved in retinoic 

acid-mediated gene activation triggered by inflammatory stimulus), oxidative stress 

response pathways such as that mediated by the nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 

(NRF2) and coagulation and complement systems (involved in thrombosis, fibrosis, 

inflammation and vascular alterations) (Fig. 10C).  

 Accordingly to our functional and histopathological results, several novel 

proteins related to renal disease were identified in the kidney of LOBE-treated animals. 

Proteins associated with tubular and glomerular injury, necrosis, inflammation and 

fibrosis were up-regulated or unique in envenomed rats (Fig. 10D). Some of these 

molecules, mainly those that were related to renal disease or identified in canonical 

pathways, are listed in Table 2. A complete list with differentially expressed and unique 

proteins of envenomed and control animals are shown in supplemental Table 1. It is 

worth mentioning, that proteins functionally linked to tissue injury (markers of necrosis 

and/or apoptosis), osmotic and oxidative stress, electrolytic imbalance, acute phase 

inflammatory response, fibrosis and thrombosis were expressed in the kidneys of 

LOBE-treated rats (Table 2). Proteins of the kallikrein-kinin and complement systems 

which are related to hypotension and control of vascular permeability were also found 

to be up-regulated in envenomed animals (Table 2). Our proteomic data also confirm 

that an important mechanism of Lonomia-induced AKI is mediated by hemoglobin and 

the release of its degradation products: free heme and iron. In fact, hemoglobin, 

hemopexin and ferritin were up-regulated and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 was 

uniquely induced in the kidneys of envenomed rats (Table 2). As a result of heme and 

iron release, several antioxidant enzymes were found to be up-regulated, indicating the 

generation of reactive oxygen species (Table 2).  

 

4. Discussion 

 AKI is frequently described and is life threatening in several cases of snake and 

arthropod envenomation (Sitprija, 2006; Berger et al., 2012). Particularly in Lonomia 

obliqua envenomation, AKI is the main cause of death and its mechanisms are 



Resultados 

131 

 

completely unknown until now. In this work we use an in vivo experimental model to 

characterize the L. obliqua-induced AKI. According to our results, the 

pathophysiological mechanism seems to be complex and multifactorial involving four 

main issues: (1) vascular abnormalities; (2) tubular and glomerular alterations; (3) renal 

inflammation and (4) a direct venom cytotoxic activity.   

 

4.1 Vascular abnormalities 

 Rats injected with L. obliqua venom presented important hemodynamic 

alterations characterized by systemic hypotension and increased heart rate. The time of 

maximal decrease in blood pressure was coincident with the reduction of GFR and the 

impairment of renal function. In addition, an increase of renal vascular permeability and 

edema was also observed at the same period of envenomation. These findings are 

important because systemic vasodilation is associated with the decrease in GFR and can 

lead to renal hypoperfusion and ischemia in different pathological conditions (Schrier et 

al., 2004). Specifically in this type of envenomation, one mechanism that could 

contribute to vasodilation is the activation of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). It is known 

that L. obliqua venom has toxins (kallikrein activators and kininogenases) able to 

activate plasma pre-kallikrein and directly release bradykinin (BK) from low molecular 

weight kininogen (LMWK) (Pinto et al., 2010; Bohrer et al., 2007). Interestingly, our 

results indicated that the expression of LMWK (the main substrate of tissue kallikrein 

and venom kininogenases) is up-regulated in the kidneys of envenomed animals, which 

may favor the generation of BK. The immediate consequence of intravascular activation 

of KKS is a fall in systemic blood pressure and in peripheral tissues is edema and 

erythema formation (Bohrer et al., 2007). The participation of BK was already 

confirmed, since the hypotensive and edematogenic responses elicited by LOBE were 

inhibited by HOE-140, a B2 receptor antagonist (Bohrer et al., 2007). In agreement with 

these experimental observations, hypotension and reduced plasma levels of pre-

kallikrein are common features observed in patients (Zannin et al., 2003), which support 

the evidence that KKS is activated during envenomation and is clinically relevant. 

Moreover, the data presented here also suggest that KKS activation may be involved in 

venom-induced AKI.

4.2 Tubular and glomerular alterations  

 Despite the scarce clinical case-reports, the main pathological finding obtained 

from kidney biopsies is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Experimental animals also 

showed histological alterations compatible with ATN such as loss of proximal brush 

border, cytoplasm vacuolation, pyknotic nuclei, degeneration and desquamation of 

necrotic cells. These necrotic cells exfoliating into the lumen due to either cell death or 

defective cell-to-cell or cell-to-basement membrane adhesion, can obstruct the flow of 

filtrated fluid and give rise to a back pressure limiting glomerular filtration (Trof et al., 

2006). Accordingly, in this work, markers of ATN were detected in urine (urinary ?-

GT) and several proteins related to tubule injury were found to be up-regulated (Orm-1, 

YBX1, Alb, CK-B, FABP3 and NHE-RF1) or uniquely expressed (NGAL) in the 

kidneys of envenomed rats. Proteins linked to apoptosis (CytC, S100-A8 and MFP-1) 

were also up-regulated. The occurrence of glomerular dysfunction was evident, because 

envenomed rats presented massive proteinuria, serum Alb had a 2.1-fold increase in the 

kidneys and a band corresponding to the molecular weight of Alb was detected in urine. 

In addition, our results confirm that hematuria and hemoglobinuria are predominant 

characteristics of L. obliqua-induced AKI. Indeed, the venom has strong in vitro and in 

vivo hemolytic activity and a phospholipase A2 responsible for this effect was already 

isolated (Seibert et al., 2006; Seibert et al., 2010). Intact erythrocytes were found within 

the tubules forming intra-tubular casts and, as a result of intravascular hemolysis, 

different Hb subunits were detected in urine and kidneys. It is known that the formation 

of Hb deposits may be toxic to renal tubules due to heme cytotoxicity (Zager, 1996). 

Once reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells the heme porphyrin ring is rapidly 

catabolized by Hmox-1 yielding equimolar amounts of free iron, biliverdin and carbon 

monoxide (Camara and Soares, 2005). Free iron then up-regulates intracellular ferritin 

expression, a key defense mechanism against iron-induced tissue damage. However, in 

the presence of large amounts of Hb the levels of released iron also increase, saturating 

the binding capacity of ferritin. Thus, the iron not removed by ferritin binding is able to 

readily accept and donate electrons and greatly facilitates free radical production (Zager, 

1996; Khan, 2009; Zager et al., 2012). As proteins related to canonical pathways of 

oxidative stress were identified exclusively in the kidneys of LOBE-treated rats, we 

believe that heme cytotoxicity plays a significant role in L. obliqua-induced AKI. 

Consistent with this, several anti-oxidant enzymes (Prdx-5, Prdx-2, GST, DJ-1 and 

SOD) and proteins associated with heme and iron metabolism (Hmox-1, ferritin, Hpx

and Cygb) were up-regulated or uniquely expressed during envenomation, suggesting 

that heme is effectively metabolized, generating free radicals and inducing oxidative 

damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. In fact, in previous experiments we demonstrated 

that LOBE induces kidney DNA damage leading to double-strand breaks and formation 

of oxidized purines and pyrimidines (Berger et al., 2013). Probably this is associated 

with the increased expression of Rad50, a double-strand break repair protein, detected in 

the present work.        

 As a consequence of ATN, the excretion of Na
+
 and K

+
 increased significantly 

during envenomation. Injured proximal tubule cells have alterations in the actin and 

microtubule cytoskeletal networks that lead to a redistribution of Na
+
/K

+
 ATPase from 

the basolateral to the apical membrane, contributing to a decrease in Na
+
 transport and 

reabsorption (Thadhani et al., 1996). It was reported that FENa+ and FEK+ also increase 

in envenomation caused by Bothrops snakes (Boer-Lima et al., 1999; Linardi et al., 

2011). Despite the redistribution of Na
+
/K

+
 ATPase to the apical membrane, Linardi et 

al. (2011) reported an increase in expression and activity of Na
+
/K

+
 ATPase during 

envenomation by Bothrops alternatus and suggest that it is a protective mechanism 

triggered in response to natriuresis with the aim to preserve renal function during acute 

damage. In agreement with this observation, we found an increase in expression of type-

3 Na
+
/H

+
 exchanger regulatory cofactor, which is important in Na

+
 and HCO

-
3 

reabsorption in proximal tubule cells (Trof et al., 2006). Likewise Na
+
/K

+
, water 

excretion increased significantly and envenomed animals had polyuria. Several 

parameters measured, such as urinary density and osmolality, Cosm, CH2O and FEH2O, 

indicate that kidneys from envenomed rats are producing dilute urine through the 

excretion of solute-free water. Possibly, the presence of intratubular Na
+
 not reabsorbed 

by proximal tubule cells may contribute to the increased water excretion and both, Na
+
 

and water rejection, may also be associated with the fall in blood pressure.    

 Regarding the glomerular dysfunctions, a valuable hypothesis that should be 

considered is the deposition of fibrin clots in glomerular capillaries. Indeed, the most 

potent activity of LOBE in vitro is the procoagulant activity (Donato et al., 1998; Veiga 

et al., 2003). In vivo, LOBE also causes activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis 

leading to a consumptive coagulopathy characteristic of this type of envenomation. Two 

enzymes responsible for the venom procoagulant activity, activators of prothrombin and 

factor X, have already been isolated (Alvarez-Flores et al., 2006; Reis et al., 2006). 

Besides the direct effect on coagulation factors, LOBE is also able to induce a 



Resultados 

134 

 

procoagulant profile in endothelial cells in culture through an up-regulation of TF 

expression (Pinto et al., 2008). Confirming these results obtained in endothelial cells, 

envenomed kidneys showed an increase in TF procoagulant activity. In addition, the 

expression of known markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis 

(serpin 1 alpha-1-antiproteinase, PAI-1 and HC-2) increased in the kidneys of venom-

treated rats. The gamma and beta chains of fibrinogen were detected solely in 

envenomed kidneys, which are probably related to the PAS positive stain observed in 

glomeruli and is suggestive of fibrin formation.   

 

4.3 Renal Inflammation 

 Intense inflammatory response is a common feature in L. obliqua envenomation. 

Pain and edema are the most characteristic initial symptoms observed at the local site of 

contact (Zannin et al., 2003). Usually signs of systemic inflammation with neutrophilic 

leukocytosis, cell infiltrate and edema have also been described in lungs, kidney and 

heart of experimental animals (Berger et al., 2013). The inflammatory response is 

accompanied by the production of several cytokines (TNF, IL-1? IL-8, IL-6, CCL2 and 

CXCL1), vasoactive mediators (BK, histamine, prostaglandins and nitric oxide), 

adhesion molecules (E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-3) and an increase in leukocyte 

rolling and adhesion to the endothelium (Alvarez-Flores et al., 2006; Bohrer et al., 

2007; Pinto et al., 2008; Berger et al., 2010; Nascimento-Silva et al., 2012). 

Specifically in the kidney, it was observed an up-regulation of several proteins related to 

acute phase inflammatory signaling, nephritis, inflammatory cell infiltration, increase in 

vascular permeability, glomerular dilation, distention of Bowman's space and interstitial 

edema. Kidney sections stained with picrosirius revealed extensive collagen deposition 

in cortical periglomerular and peritubular regions and proteins involved with fibrosis, 

such as Cygb, PAI-1, complement C3 and complement factor D were identified. 

Enhanced deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in renal tissue has been 

observed in response to a variety of stimuli, including TGF-?, TNF-?, IL-1, several 

adhesion molecules and chemoattractants. These stimuli can also increase the levels of 

tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, thereby attenuating ECM turnover, and 

thus, favoring the deposition of collagen and other matrix proteins (Eddy, 1996; 

Pawluczyk and Harris, 1998).  

Besides fibrosis, activated complement components (C3 and factor D) may also 

contribute to the alterations in vascular permeability and acts as a chemoattractant for

135 

 

neutrophils (Turnberg et al., 2006). Moreover, complement activation by albumin is a 

powerful underlying mechanism of tubular and interstitial injury via cytotoxic, 

proinflammatory, and fibrogenic effects, which often occur in renal diseases where 

proteinuria is present (Portella et al., 2013). In an experiment conducted in proximal 

tubular cells incubated with serum proteins, in vitro complement activation was 

observed, which could be associated with changes in the cytoskeleton, production of 

superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and 

TNF-? (Abbate et al., 2006). 

 

4.4 Direct venom cytotoxic activity 

As the kidneys are highly vascularized organs, they are particularly susceptible 

to direct venom toxicity (Sitprija, 2006). Renal epithelial cells in culture and isolated 

perfused kidneys have been used to characterize the direct cytotoxic effects of different 

venoms including bee, snake and spider venoms. The most common isolated toxins, 

which are nephrotoxic, belong to the classes of metalloproteinases, serine-proteinases, 

C-type lectins, phospholipases A2, sphingomyelinases D and L-amino acid oxidases 

(Berger et al., 2012). In the case of L. obliqua some toxins belonging to these classes 

have already been isolated (Pinto et al., 2010); however, their effects on renal cells are 

unknown. Our results provide some evidence that the whole venom probably has a 

direct nephrotoxic effect, since immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence 

of venom in renal tissue, with stronger staining in the initial 6 h after venom 

administration followed by a progressive decrease thereafter. The venom was rapidly 

excreted in urine, because at least 5 bands which specifically react with antibodies 

raised against L. obliqua toxins were detected in urine. Interestingly, the positive 

immunohistochemical reaction for venom in different kidney structures agreed with the 

morphological and histological damage caused by the venom in these anatomical 

regions and indicated that there was a close correlation between the sites of venom 

localization and subsequent tissue injury. Previous studies are consistent with our 

observations. Using immunochemical and radio-labeling methods to analyze venom 

biodistribution in rats, the highest quantities of LOBE were detected in kidneys, blood 

and urine (Rocha-Campos et al., 2001; Da Silva et al., 2004).

5. Conclusion 

 In this work a rat experimental model was used to study the progression of renal 

disease during Lonomia obliqua envenomation. According to our results, the 

pathophysiological mechanism involved in L. obliqua-induced AKI seems to be 

multifactorial where events such as systemic hypotension and fibrin deposition 

contribute to renal hypoperfusion, tubular necrosis and the sudden loss of basic renal 

functions, including filtration and excretion capacities, urinary concentration and 

maintenance of body fluid homeostasis. In addition, when compared to control rats, the 

kidneys from envenomed animals showed to be increasingly enriched for stress-related 

proteins, which are commonly associated to inflammation, tissue injury, heme-induced 

oxidative stress, coagulation and complement systems activation. Finally, the 

localization of the venom in renal tissue agreed with morphological and functional 

alterations, suggesting a close correlation between venom tissue levels and renal 

damage.

Figure 2. Proteinuria. (A) Rats were injected subcutaneously with PBS (controls - 

CTRL) or LOBE (1.5 or 1.0 mg/kg). After different times post administration the 

protein levels in urine were measured. Data are presented as means ± SE (n=6/group). 

Statistical differences of *p &amp;lt;0.05 vs. CTRL and 
§
p &amp;lt;0.05 vs. LOBE (1.0 mg/kg, s.c) 

were considered significant. (B) Representative urine samples from CTRL and rats 

treated with LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8-20 %) under 

reducing conditions. (C) Toxins excreted in urine were detected by western-blot. 

Samples of urine from CTRL and rats treated with LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) at 6 and 12 h 

post-venom injection were separated by SDS-PAGE and different toxins were detected 

by immunoreaction with polyclonal antibodies against LOBE. Toxins present in crude 

bristle extract are also showed (LOBE). The arrows indicate bands detected in urine 

samples at 6 and 12 h of envenomation. Molecular weight (MW) standards were shown 

on the left of figure B and C.  

 

Figure 3. L. obliqua envenomation induces acute tubular necrosis. Representative 

kidney sections from control (CTRL) or envenomed animals (injected with 1.5 mg/kg, 

s.c.) are presented (A-G). Note the normal morphology of kidney from CTRL animal 

(A) in comparison to the progressive degenerative lesions of venom-treated rats (B-G). 

Increased acidophilia, dilation of renal tubules, loss of proximal brush border, 

cytoplasm vacuolation, nuclear pyknosis and desquamation of necrotic cells can be 

observed (D-F). Hyaline (arrowheads in C, D and G) and hematic (arrows in D) casts 

are also present inside renal tubules. Arrowheads in E indicate necrotic cells. Asterisks 

in D and F indicate the presence of a hyaline material within the Bowman's space and 

an inflammatory cell infiltrate and edema, respectively. All sections were stained with 

H&amp;amp;E. Magnification: 10 X. (H) Levels of urinary ?-glutamyl transferase (?-GT) activity 

were measured in rats injected with PBS or LOBE (1.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) at different times 

post-administration. Data are presented as means ± SE (n=6/group). Statistical 

differences of *p &amp;lt;0.05 vs. CTRL and

formed by a protein-rich material (predominantly serum albumin and hemoglobin), 

while hematic casts (black arrows) are formed by fragmented or intact erythrocytes. 

Due to tubular necrosis, the basement membrane in some tubules is disrupted, resulting 

in detachment of necrotic cells into the lumen (white arrowheads).  All sections were 

stained with H&amp;amp;E. Magnification: 4 X (panel A) and 20 X (panel B).     

 

Figure 5. L. obliqua envenomation induces renal inflammation and fibrosis. Light 

micrographs showing a marked inflammatory cell infiltrate (arrowheads) in the tubulo-

interstitial region at 96 h (B) and glomerulus at 48 h (C) after LOBE injection (1.5 

mg/kg, s.c.). There were no signs of inflammation in control (CTRL) animals (A). It 

was also observed an extensive peritubular (E) and interglomerular (F) collagen 

deposition at 96 h (regions stained in red), indicating fibrosis. Arrowheads in these 

panels indicate inflammatory infiltrate. There were no signs of fibrosis in CTRL rats 

(D). Stain: H&amp;amp;E (panels A-C) and picrosirius (panels D-F). Magnification: 10 X (panel 

A, B, D and E), 20 X (panel F) and 40 X (panel C).

increase in the deposition of a PAS positive material in glomerular capillaries of LOBE-

injected animals (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in comparison to controls. Also note the increase in 

glomerular size. All sections were stained with PAS. Magnification: 40 X. B. Thirty 

glomeruli from each animal injected with the dose of 1.5 mg/kg were used to quantify 

the mean area of glomerulus, glomerular tuft and Bowman's space of animals treated 

with the dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Data are presented as means ± SE (n=6/group). Statistical 

differences of *p &amp;lt;0.05 in comparison to the respective control (C) were considered 

significant. C. Renal tissue factor activity was measured in control (C) and envenomed 

(1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) animals  by generation of factor Xa (FXa). Data are presented as means 

± SE (n=6/group). Statistical differences of *p &amp;lt;0.05 were considered significant in 

comparison to the respective control.

12 h of envenomation. Note the vascular leakage and edema (asterisks) and migration of 

inflammatory cells to damaged tissue (arrowheads). Also, the presence of a hyaline 

material inside the Bowman's space (asterisk in B) was associated with the increase in

glomerular area observed at this time. All sections were stained with H&amp;amp;E. 

Magnification: 10 X (panel A) and 40 X (panel B). C. Evaluation of changes in renal 

vascular permeability were assessed by Evans blue dye extravasation. Results are 

expressed as ?g Evans blue dye per 100 mg of renal tissue from control (CTRL) and 

LOBE-treated (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) rats at 12 and 24 h post-venom administration.  Data are 

presented as means ± SE (n=6/group). Statistical comparisons are indicated.  

 

Figure 8. Immunohistochemical detection of L. obliqua venom in renal tissue. 

Positive immunohistochemical reaction was found in cortical and medullar regions of 

kidneys from rats injected with 1.5 mg/kg of LOBE (B-E). Venom was detected in 

glomerular capillaries (arrows in B), Bowman’s capsule (arrow in the inset B), tubular 

brush border (arrows in the inset C), in intra-tubular casts (arrowheads in C) and also 

was present in cells of tubules in degeneration (arrowheads in the insets C and D). After 

96 h the immunoreactivity for venom was weak and mainly localized in tubules (arrows 

in E). There was no immunoreactivity in the renal structures of control (CTRL) rats (A). 

Magnification: 10 X (panels A-E) and 40 X (insets in B-D) F. The amounts of venom 

detected in renal tissue was estimated by the area of positive immunohistochemical 

reaction. Thirty sections per rat were analyzed as described in material and methods. 

Data are presented as means ± SE (n=6/group). 

 

Figure 9. Immunohistochemical detection of L. obliqua venom in renal vascular 

tissue.    Positive immunohistochemical reaction was detected in renal arteries (A) and 

veins (B) of rats injected with LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) at 6 h of envenomation. Note the 

presence of venom in perivascular connective tissue (arrows) and endothelium and 

smooth muscle cells (arrowheads). Magnification: 10 X (panel B) and 40 X (panel A). 

 

Figure 10. Kidney proteins differentially expressed during L. obliqua 

envenomation. Unique or differentially expressed kidney proteins from control and 

envenomed (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) animals were identified at 24 h post-venom injection by 

proteomic analysis. Exclusive and common proteins in each condition, as well as the 

total number of proteins identified are showed via a Venn diagram (A). Top canonical 

pathways of differentially expressed and unique proteins identified in control (CTRL) 

(B) and LOBE-treated (C) kidneys are shown. Those proteins functionally related to 

renal disease were also categorized accordingly to their roles in different types of renal

pathologies (D). Each functional annotation is assigned to a significance score 

represented as P value (Fisher exact test) determining the probability that the 

association between the proteins in the data set and the canonical pathway or function in 

disease is explained by chance alone. The number of identified proteins (NIP) that 

belong to a particular canonical pathway or play a role in renal pathology is shown.

 Neste capítulo final, uma abordagem farmacológica foi utilizada para explorar o 

papel do sistema calicreína-cininas (SCC) na insuficiência renal aguda induzida pelo 

veneno da taturana em ratos. 

 

Os principais resultados obtidos foram: 

 

? O SCC está ativado no rim durante o envenenamento. Há um aumento na 

expressão gênica dos receptores B1 e B2 (B1R e B2R) de bradicinina, 

diminuição na expressão da enzima conversora de angiotensina (ECA), aumento 

da atividade da calicreína renal e plasmática e aumento na produção de óxido 

nítrico no rim; 

? A ativação de calicreína e o aumento na expressão de B1R indicam que o SCC 

tem papel fundamental para o desenvolvimento das lesões renais. O tratamento 

prévio com antagonistas de B1R ou a inibição de calicreína previne as principais 

alterações de função renal, incluindo a queda acentuada do ritmo de filtração 

glomerular, aumento de creatinina plasmática e proteinúria. O pré-tratamento 

com antagonistas de B2R não apresenta qualquer efeito; 

? O antagonismo de B1R ou inibição de calicreína protege contra as alterações 

tubulares degenerativas, inflamação e obstrução tubular. O antagonismo de B2R 

não apresenta efeito; 

? O antagonismo de B1R ou inibição de calicreína previne o desenvolvimento da 

coagulopatia de consumo, já o antagonismo de B2R não apresenta o mesmo 

efeito.

Abstract 

 

Lonomia obliqua venom is highly nephrotoxic, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is the 

main cause of death among envenomed victims. We have previously demonstrated that 

the pathophysiological mechanism underlying L. obliqua-induced AKI seems to be 

multifactorial and involves renal hypoperfusion, inflammation, tubular necrosis and the 

sudden loss of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption capacities. In the present 

study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) 

components to the hemodynamic instability, inflammation and consequent renal 

functional impairment. To this end, rats were treated with either the bradykinin receptor 

B1 (B1R) antagonists DALBK and R-715, the B2 receptor (B2R) antagonist HOE-140, or 

a kallikrein inhibitor (aprotinin) 30 min prior to the subcutaneous injection of L. obliqua 

venom (1.5 mg/kg). After 24 h of envenomation, plasma, urine and kidney samples 

were collected to analyze renal function, morphological alterations and the expression 

of KKS components. The activity of renal tissue kallikrein and the expression of the 

B1R and B2R increased during envenomation, indicating that the KKS was indeed 

activated. Both B1R antagonism and kallikrein inhibition prevented glomerular injury 

and reductions in the rate of glomerular filtration, and restored fluid homeostasis and 

tubular water retention ability. The main mechanism underlying these beneficial effects 

was associated with decreased renal inflammation and reduced levels of renal pro-

inflammatory cytokines and tubular degeneration. In addition, B1R antagonists and 

aprotinin also ameliorated venom-induced blood incoagulability and hemorrhagic 

syndrome, an outcome that is commonly observed during L. obliqua envenomation. In 

contrast, rats pretreated with the B2R antagonist, HOE-140, did not display such 

beneficial effects. Thus, these data indicate that blocking kallikrein or B1R activity may 

be therapeutic alternatives that could be used to control the progression of L. obliqua 

venom-induced AKI.

1. Introduction 

 

 Envenomation resulting from contact with Lonomia obliqua caterpillars has been 

recognized as a neglected public health issue that mainly occurs in impoverished 

communities in the rural areas of the southern regions of Brazil. Envenomed victims 

display systemic hemorrhage secondary to intravascular disseminated coagulation (For 

review see Veiga et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2010). Frequently, the clinical profile evolves 

to acute kidney injury (AKI), which is the main cause of death following this type of 

envenomation (Gamborgi et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2012). In experimental models, L. 

obliqua venom induces the sudden loss of basic renal functions, including filtration and 

excretion capacities, urinary concentration and the maintenance of body fluid 

homeostasis. In addition to the direct cytotoxic effects of venom toxins, renal 

hypoperfusion also appears to be an important underlying mechanism, because signs of 

glomerular fibrin deposition and hemodynamic instability (systemic hypotension and 

increased renal vascular permeability) have been detected in rats injected with L. 

obliqua venom (Berger et al., unpublished data). In fact, the coagulation, complement 

and kallikrein-kinin systems are known to be activated during envenomation (Zannin et 

al., 2003; Bohrer et al., 2007).   

 The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is composed of potent vasoactive and 

proinflammatory molecules that are involved in the control of blood pressure, vascular 

permeability, smooth muscle contraction or relaxation, and pain. Kinins are generated 

by the proteolytic cleavage of kininogens by tissue or plasma kallikreins. Once released, 

kinins exert the majority of their biological effects by activating two types of kinin 

receptors: the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R) and the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). The 

B2R is constitutively expressed in most tissues, and displays a higher affinity for 

bradykinin (BK) and Lys-BK peptides. In contrast, the B1R displays high affinities for 

the kinin metabolites des-Arg
9
-BK and Lys-des-Arg

9
-BK. The B1R is not expressed 

under normal conditions, but is induced following inflammatory, infectious or traumatic 

stimuli (Regoli and Barabé, 1980, Calixto et al., 2004; Campos et al., 2006; Kayashima 

et al., 2012). Both the B1R and B2R are G protein-coupled, seven transmembrane 

domain receptors. Stimulation of the latter elevates intracellular Ca
+2

 concentrations and 

phospholipase A2 activity, leading to the release of various mediators, including nitric 

oxide (NO), prostaglandins, arachidonic acids and other inflammatory agents (Kakoki 

and Smithies, 2009). Notably, the B1R and B2R are involved in several inflammation-

related processes, such as atherosclerosis, airway inflammation, diabetic neuropathy, 

inflammatory bowel diseases, neuropathic pain, and cerebral infarction (Couture et al., 

2001; Souza et al., 2004; Hara et al., 2008; Quintão et al., 2008; Austinat et al., 2009; 

Duchene and Ahluwalia, 2009; Kakoki et al., 2010). In renal diseases specifically, B1R 

deletion or antagonism has been associated with renoprotection against ischemia-

reperfusion-induced injury, glomerulonephritis and renal inflammation and fibrosis 

(Wang et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2009; Klein et al., 2010). In contrast, mice lacking the 

B2R displayed enhanced diabetic nephropathy (Kakoki et al., 2004).      

 The KKS is involved in the edematogenic and hypotensive responses elicited by 

L. obliqua venom. L. obliqua venom induces the release of kinins from low-molecular 

weight kininogen (LMWK), and both edematogenic and hypotensive responses are 

reduced following kallikrein inhibition and B2R antagonism (Bohrer et al., 2007). 

Moreover, envenomed patients presented low levels of plasma prekallikrein, indicating 

that kallikrein had been activated and released into the blood circulation (Zannin et al., 

2003). Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that the generation of kallikrein 

and BK during envenomation may be involved in L. obliqua-induced hemodynamic 

instability, inflammation and the consequent renal functional impairment. 

 In the present study, we used different pharmacological treatments to study the 

roles of kallikrein and the kinin receptors, B1R and B2R, in an experimental model of L. 

obliqua-induced AKI. The results indicated that both kallikrein inhibition and B1R 

antagonism were able to prevent venom-induced blood incoagulability and restore renal 

function by reducing tubular necrosis and tissue inflammation. In summary, these data 

indicate that blocking kallikrein activity or the B1R may be therapeutic alternatives that 

could be used to control the progression of the renal pathology that is observed 

following L. obliqua envenomation.

  2.2 Venom 

 L. obliqua caterpillars were kindly provided by the Centro de Informações 

Toxicológicas (CIT), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The specimens used in 

the present study were collected in the cities of Bom Princípio and Progresso, both of 

which are located at Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. L. obliqua venom was obtained by 

cutting bristles at the base of each scoli and macerating them in cold phosphate-buffered 

saline (PBS), pH = 7.4, as previously described (Veiga et al., 2005; Pinto et al., 2006; 

Berger et al., 2010). The venom obtained following this procedure was designated as 

Lonomia obliqua Bristle Extract (LOBE). The protein concentrations of the LOBE 

samples were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA), and the 

aliquots were stored at -80 °C prior to use.

facility of our institution. The animals were housed under standard conditions within a 

temperature controlled room (22-23 ºC, on a 12 h light/dark cycle, with the lights on at 

7:00 am), and had free access to water and food. All of the procedures involving

2.4 Experimental design 

 

2.4.1 Venom induced-acute kidney injury (AKI) 

 The time course of alterations in KKS components during L. obliqua induced-

AKI was examined using an in vivo experimental model of envenomation. The animals 

were divided into one of two groups: A control group (CTRL), which contained animals 

(n = 6 per sampling time) that were injected subcutaneously (sc) with 100 µL of a sterile 

PBS solution, and an experimental group (LOBE), which contained animals (n = 6 per 

sampling time) that were injected sc with a solution containing 1.5 mg of the LOBE per 

kg of body weight in a final volume of 100 µL. The animals were then distributed 

individually in metabolic cages, which allowed for quantitative urine collections and 

measurements of water intake. At several time points post-venom injection (12, 24, 48 

and 96 h), blood, urine and kidney samples were obtained for biochemical, 

histopathological, and renal tissue factor activity and gene expression analyses. The 

venom dose and times post-envenomation were selected based on the results of previous 

experiments that were conducted using rats as an animal model (Berger et al., 

unpublished data) to reproduce the kidney damage and consumption coagulopathy that 

has been observed in humans (Dias da Silva et al., 1996; Rocha-Campos et al., 2001; 

Gamborgi et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2010).  

 

2.4.2 Pharmacological treatments 

 Different pharmacological treatments were tested to determine the roles of the 

BK receptors and kallikrein. The animals were divided into six groups (n = 6/group): (i) 

Control group (CTRL), in which the animals were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with 250 

?L of a sterile PBS solution 30 min prior to the sc injection of 100 ?L of a sterile PBS 

solution; (ii) LOBE + PBS, in which the animals were treated with 250 ?L of PBS (ip) 

30 min prior to the injection of the LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, sc); (iii) LOBE + HOE-140, in 

which the animals were treated with the B2R antagonist, HOE-140 (250 ?g/kg, ip, 

diluted in 250 ?L of PBS), 30 min prior to the injection of the LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, sc); 

(iv) LOBE + DALBK, in which the animals were treated with the B1R antagonist, 

DALBK (1.0 mg/kg, ip, diluted in 250 ?L of PBS), 30 min prior to the injection of the 

LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, sc); (v) LOBE + R-715, in which the animals were treated with the 

B1R antagonist, R-715 (1.0 mg/kg, ip, diluted in 250 ?L of PBS), 30 min prior to the 

injection of the LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, sc); and (vi) LOBE + APROTININ, in which the

animals were treated with the kallikrein inhibitor, aprotinin (5.6 mg/kg, iv, 

corresponding to 40,000 kallikrein inhibitory units/kg, diluted in sterile saline), 30 min 

prior to the injection of the LOBE (1.5 mg/kg, sc). Additional groups were treated only 

with the drugs (using the same doses) to exclude their own direct effects on renal 

function parameters. Immediately after the treatments, the animals were distributed 

individually in metabolic cages. At 24 h post-venom injection, blood, urine and kidney 

samples were obtained for biochemical, histopathological, renal tissue factor activity 

and gene expression analyses. All of the drug doses were selected based on previously 

published data (Day et al., 2006; Bohrer et al., 2007; Austinat et al., 2009; Raslan et al., 

2010; Viana et al., 2010)  

 

2.5 Blood, urine and kidney samples 

 Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture in rats that had been 

anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and anticoagulated 

with 1:10 (v/v) 3.8 % trisodium citrate. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1500 x 

g for 10 min and stored at – 80 ºC prior to the biochemical determinations. Urine 

samples were collected directly from the metabolic cages and centrifuged at 2500 x g 

for 5 min. The supernatants were stored under the same conditions used for the plasma 

samples. After blood collection, the hearts were perfused through the left ventricle with 

a PBS solution, and a circulatory circuit was opened by an incision in the right atrium to 

ensure the elimination of intravascular blood. Immediately after perfusion, the kidneys 

were quickly removed. One of the kidneys was fixed for histological analysis, and the 

other was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 ºC prior to the measurements of 

tissue factor and kallikrein activities, nitrate/nitrite levels and the gene expression 

profile. For the measurements of tissue factor and kallikrein activities and nitrate/nitrite 

levels, a portion of the kidney was homogenized in a cold PBS solut ion containing 1 % 

Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 9500 x g for 15 min. The supernatants were 

immediately used in the assays. 

 

2.6 Analyses of renal function 

 The levels of creatinine, urinary ?-glutamyl transferase (?-GT) activity and 

urinary proteins were used for renal function assessments. Urine and plasma creatinine, 

urinary ?-GT activity and proteinuria were determined spectrophotometrically (SP-220 

BioSpectro Spectrophotometer, Paraná, Brazil) using commercially available kits

173 

 

(BioClin/Quibasa, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 

expressed as mL/min/100 g of body weight, was estimated by the creatinine clearance 

(Ccr) using the standard formula: Ccr = Ucr.V/Pcr, where Ucr is the urinary creatinine 

concentration, V is the urinary output and Pcr is the plasma creatinine concentration. 

Water fractional excretion (FEH2O), expressed as a %, was determined using the 

equation: FEH2O = V/GFR.100. Hydric balance (HB), expressed as a %, represents the 

relationship between water consumption (WC) and urinary output (V). It was calculated 

as: HB = V/WC.100.   

 

2.7 Gene expression analyses 

 Renal mRNA levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin 

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin II receptor (AT1R), angiotensin (1-7) 

receptor (MAS), the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R), the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) 

and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were estimated using 

quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). First, total RNA was extracted from the kidneys 

using the TRIzol
®
 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) reagent, according to the 

manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 ?g 

of total pure RNA, 200 units of reverse transcriptase, 100 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) (1.0 

?L), 5× reverse transcription buffer (2.5 ?L), 10 mM dNTPs (1.8 ?L), 10,000 units of 

RNAsin (0.2 ?L) and 50 ng/ml of oligo(dT) (1.0 ?L). The temperature profile for this 

reaction was: 25

resultant cDNA was used for real-time PCR, as described below. Specific primers were 

designed using Primer Express software and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems 

(California, USA). The primers were as follows (forward and reverse, respectively):

both the AT1a and AT1b receptor subtypes. Real-time PCR was carried out using an 

ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) 

with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, California, USA). The 

relative levels of gene expression were determined using the comparative threshold 

cycle method, as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions, in which the data for each 

sample were normalized to GAPDH expression. 

 

2.8 Renal tissue factor activities 

 Renal tissue factor (TF) was measured indirectly based on its ability to form a 

complex with factor VIIa (TF/FVIIa) and activate factors IX and X (Morrissey, 1995). 

Briefly, the kidneys were collected as described above, homogenized in a cold PBS 

solution containing 1 % Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 9500 x g for 15 min. 

Supernatant samples (10 µg of protein) were incubated with a concentrated mixture of 

the FVII+FIX+FX complex (15 µg total) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 

mM CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Activated factor Xa (FXa) that was produced during the 

reaction was detected by the addition of a specific chromogenic substrate (0.2 mM 

S2222). The kinetics of p-nitroaniline release were monitored at 405 nm for 30 min in a 

final volume of 100 µL using a microplate reader spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX, 

Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, USA). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and 

the results were expressed as µmol of FXa generated per min per mg of kidney tissue. 

 

2.9 Plasma prekallikrein and renal kallikrein activities 

 To measure plasma prekallikrein, plasma samples (5 ?L) were previously 

incubated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 ?M elagic acid, phospholipids, 

0.005 % bovine albumin and 10 mM CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Activated kallikrein 

that was produced during the reaction was detected by the addition of 0.2 mM S2302, a 

specific chromogenic substrate for plasma kallikrein. To measure renal kallikrein, 

kidney extracts were prepared as described above, diluted (1:2) and incubated (15 ?L) 

in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37°C. Kallikrein activity was detected by the 

addition of 0.2 mM S2366, a specific chromogenic substrate for tissue kallikrein. In 

both cases, the kinetics of p-nitroaniline release were monitored at 405 nm for 30 min in 

a final volume of 100 µL using a microplate reader spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX, 



Resultados 

175 

 

Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, USA). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and 

the results were expressed as µmol of p-nitroaniline released per min per mg of protein. 

 

2.10 Nitric oxide determinations 

 The total plasmatic and kidney levels of nitrate and nitrite were determined as an 

indication of nitric oxide (NO) production, as described previously (Miranda et al., 

2001). Briefly, plasma or kidney samples were deproteinized by the addition of 1:1 

(v/v) ethanol and incubated overnight at 4
 
°C. After centrifugation at 1500 X g for 10 

min, the supernatants (100 ?L) were mixed with 8 mg/mL of VCl3 (100 ?L) in 96 well 

microplates. The Griess reagent (100 ?L of 2 % SULF + 0.1 % NEED) was 

immediately added to the wells, and the absorbance was then read at 540 nm after 30 

min of incubation at room temperature. The sample values were compared with the 

absorbance of a standard curve of sodium nitrate (1 – 200 ?M). 

 

2.11 Histology  

 For the renal histopathology analyses, the kidneys were collected, as described 

previously, sectioned sagitally, and fixed in 10 % buffered formaldehyde, pH 7.2. After 

processing in alcohol and xylol, the organs were embedded in paraffin, and 4 ?m thick 

sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). Thirty high-

power fields (40 X) of the renal cortex were randomly selected for each section, and the 

presence of the following alterations was observed: Intratubular casts, tubular 

degeneration and cellular inflammatory infiltrate. A semi-quantitative score (ranging 

from 0 to 3) was attributed to each of these alterations as follows: a score of zero was 

attributed to normal regions, a score of 1 was attributed to changes affecting less than 30 

% of the region under examination, a score of 2 was attributed to changes affecting 30 

to 60 % of the region, and a score of 3 was attributed to changes affecting greater than 

60 % of the region. All scoring was performed in a blinded manner. 

 

2.12 Assessments of renal vascular permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels 

 The index of vascular permeability was assessed by the extravasation of Evans 

blue dye into the kidneys, as described previously (Pompermayer et al., 2005). Rats 

were pretreated with either the B1R antagonist (R-715) or the kallikrein inhibitor 

(aprotinin) according to the previously outlined protocol. The rats then received Evans

176 

 

blue dye (30 mg/kg) intravenously (1 mL/kg) via the caudal vein 10 min prior to LOBE 

(1.5 mg/kg, sc) or PBS (100 µL, sc) injection. After 24 h, the animals were anesthetized 

and perfused through the left ventricle with a PBS solution to remove the intravascular 

Evans Blue. Then, the kidneys were quickly removed, weighed and allowed to dry for 

24 h at 40 °C. The dry weights were determined and Evans blue dye was extracted in 

2.5 mL of 1 % formamide (48 h at 40 °C). The absorbance of the extracted solution was 

measured in triplicate using a microplate reader spectrophotometer (SpectraMAX, 

Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, USA), and the amounts of Evans blue dye were 

calculated based on a standard curve that was generated with known concentrations of 

Evans Blue. The results are presented as the amount of Evans blue dye extravasated 

(?g) per 100 mg of kidney tissue. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 

[IL] 1-? and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-?) were determined in the kidney supernatants 

(homogenized as described in subsection 2.5) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 

assay (ELISA) kits from R&amp;amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the 

manufacturer's recommendations. 

 

2.13 Statistical analyses 

 The data are presented as the means ± SE, and significant differences were 

analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by an unpaired t-test with a Bonferroni 

correction for multiple comparisons. P-values of 0.05 were considered to be significant. 

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., 

San Diego, CA, USA). 

 

3. Results 

 

3.1 B1R and B2R expression and kallikrein activity are increased in the kidneys during 

L. obliqua-induced AKI 

 The results of a previous study indicated that the subcutaneous injection of L. 

obliqua venom (1.5 mg/kg) in rats causes a sudden loss of glomerular filtration 

capacity, a decrease in tubular hydro-electrolytic transport and tubular necrosis. These 

alterations peaked between 12 and 48 h. In the present study, we observed that 

alterations in renal function are also associated with the up-regulation of the expression 

of the BK receptors, B1R and B2R (Figs. 1A and B). B1R expression was up-regulated 

in the kidneys throughout the period of envenomation (12-96 h), with a maximal 



Resultados 

177 

 

increase of 2.1-fold observed 12 and 48 h post-venom injection (Fig. 1A). B2R 

expression in the kidneys was up-regulated between 24-96 h, with a maximal increase 

of 2.3-fold observed 48 h post-venom (Fig. 1B). The renal expression of ACE, which is 

a kininase that is responsible for BK inactivation and the generation of the 

vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II (Ang II), was down-regulated 12 and 24 h after 

envenomation (Fig. 1C). The decrease in renal ACE expression was accompanied by 

the simultaneous down-regulation of the AT1R, the Ang II receptor (Fig. 1D). At 48 and 

96 h post-envenomation, ACE expression had significantly increased in the kidneys of 

envenomed animals, but AT1R expression remained unchanged (Figs. 1C and D). The 

mRNA levels of renal MAS, which is the receptor for the vasodilator peptide 

angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)), had increased by 3.2- and 3.4-fold at 48 and 96 h, 

respectively (Fig. 1E). Despite the up-regulation of MAS expression, the mRNA levels 

of ACE2, which is the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of Ang II into Ang-

(1–7), had only increased slightly, and this increase did not reach statistical significance 

(Fig. 1F). The ratio of the expression of the MAS/AT1R receptors increased at all of the 

time points evaluated, indicating that renal MAS expression predominated during 

envenomation (Fig. 1G). However, the B2R/B1R ratio decreased at 12 h, indicating that 

B1R expression predominated at this time point. The B2R/B1R ratio increased between 

24 and 96 h, indicating that B2R expression predominated at these time points (Fig. 

1H).  

 Along with the up-regulation of the BK receptors, plasma prekallikrein activity 

decreased in envenomed animals, suggesting that active kallikrein is generated 

systemically during envenomation (Table 1). Consistent with this observation, renal 

kallikrein activity significantly increased between 24 and 96 h post-venom injection. 

Increases of 3.1-, 2.3- and 2.6-fold in renal tissue kallikrein activities were observed at 

24, 48 and 96 h, respectively, indicating that the KKS is activated in the kidneys of 

envenomed rats (Table 1). Likewise, as a consequence of kallikrein activation and BK 

formation, nitrate/nitrite levels (which are indicative of nitric oxide production) 

increased in the plasma and kidneys of envenomed animals, mainly between 12 and 24 

h.

3.2 Kinin B1 receptor blockade or kallikrein inhibition ameliorates renal function 

during L. obliqua envenomation  

 Because the KKS appeared to be activated during experimental envenomation, 

we decided to investigate whether the pharmacological blockade of kinin receptors and 

kallikrein inhibition could be beneficial during L. obliqua-induced AKI. As shown in 

Fig. 2, both B1R antagonism and systemic kallikrein inhibition prevented venom-

induced alterations in renal function. After 24 h of envenomation, significant polyuria 

was induced (Fig. 2A), which was accompanied by increases in the hydric balance (the 

ratio of urine output/water consumption) (Fig. 2B), plasma creatinine (Fig. 2C), the 

fractional excretion of water (FEH2O) (Fig. 2E), urinary protein excretion (Fig. 2F), and 

a marked reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Fig. 2D). Pretreatment with 

both B1R antagonists, DALBK and R-715, completely prevented these alterations. B1R 

antagonism restored fluid homeostasis and the tubular ability to retain water, as 

reflected by the fact that urinary output, hydric balance and FEH2O returned to the levels 

observed in the PBS-treated animals (Figs. 2A, B and E). DALBK and R-715 

pretreatment also restored filtration capacity and protected the animals from venom-

induced glomerular injury, as indicated by the levels of GFR, plasma creatinine and 

urinary protein, which had returned to the levels observed in the control animals (Figs. 

2C, D and F). All of these functional parameters also returned to normal (values similar 

to those observed in the controls) when aprotinin, a kallikrein inhibitor, was 

administered to the envenomed animals. In contrast, renal protection under B2R 

antagonism was not observed, as evidenced by the fact that pretreatment with HOE-140, 

a B2R antagonist, failed to prevent renal dysfunction (Figs. 2A-F). It is worth 

mentioning that isolated treatment with each of the drugs (administered at the doses 

tested above) did not alter renal function in non-envenomed rats (data not shown).    

 As expected, aprotinin pretreatment protected envenomed animals from plasma 

prekallikrein activation and, consequently, the levels of kallikrein in the renal tissue 

were only slightly increased. These increases were not significant in comparison to 

PBS-treated rats (Table 2). Nitric oxide production was inhibited by pretreatment with 

both B1R (DALBK and R-715) and B2R (HOE-140) antagonists and aprotinin. Plasma 

and renal nitrate/nitrite levels were significantly reduced in envenomed animals that 

were treated with BK antagonists or aprotinin in comparison to those in the LOBE+PBS 

group (Table 2).

3.3 Kinin B1 receptor blockade and kallikrein inhibition ameliorate renal 

histopathological alterations and inflammation during L. obliqua envenomation  

 We next investigated whether BK antagonists or aprotinin pretreatment would 

be effective in preventing the development of kidney lesions during L. obliqua-induced 

AKI. Along with the progressive decline in renal function, LOBE injection also induced 

progressive degenerative lesions that were compatible with acute tubular necrosis 

(ATN) (Fig. 3). Increased acidophilia, loss of the proximal brush border, inflammatory 

infiltration, edema, cytoplasmic vacuolation, degeneration and desquamation of necrotic 

cells forming intratubular casts were common alterations that were observed in 

envenomed animals (LOBE+PBS group) (Figs. 3A and B). In general, pretreatment 

with DALBK, R-715 and aprotinin prevented the occurrence of these morphological 

alterations, despite the presence of intratubular casts in some of the tubules of the rats 

that had been pretreated with DALBK and aprotinin (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, the 

histopathological scores for intratubular casts, tubular degeneration and renal 

inflammation were ameliorated following B1R blockade or systemic kallikrein 

inhibition. Similar effects were not observed following B2R antagonism (Fig. 3B). 

Further confirming these histological observations, DALBK, R-715 and aprotinin 

reduced ?-GT urinary activity, which is considered to be an efficient biomarker for ATN 

(Guder and Ross, 1984). However, ?-GT activity remained high in envenomed animals 

that had been pretreated with HOE-140 (Fig. 3C). The main mechanism involved in the 

beneficial effects of B1R blockade or kallikrein inhibition appeared to be the 

suppression of renal inflammation, because pretreatment with R-715 or aprotinin 

reduced renal vascular extravasation (Fig. 3D) and the production of the pro-

inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) (Fig. 3E) and interleukin 1-? 

(IL-1?) (Fig. 3F). 

 

3.4 Kinin B1 receptor blockade and kallikrein inhibition ameliorate L. obliqua 

envenomation-induced hemostatic abnormalities 

 L. obliqua envenomation is known to induce blood incoagulability and thus, 

hemorrhagic syndrome, which is characterized by coagulation and fibrinolysis 

activation with the secondary consumption of coagulation factors, including fibrinogen 

(Zannin et al., 2003; Berger et al., 2010). In the present study, our results indicated that 

envenomed animals that had been injected with the B2R antagonist displayed a 

prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), while those that had been 



Resultados 

180 

 

pretreated with the B1R antagonists or aprotinin displayed aPTT values that were similar 

to non-envenomed animals, indicating that blood clotting remained normal in these rats 

(Fig. 4A). Despite the normal coagulation time, fibrinogen levels were significantly 

reduced in envenomed animals that received the B1R antagonists or aprotinin, although 

partial recovery occurred in these groups (Fig. 4B). Aprotinin was also the only 

treatment that was able to protect against the increases in renal tissue factor activity 

(Fig. 4C). 

 

4. Discussion 

 Collectively, our results indicate that the renal KKS is activated during L. 

obliqua-induced AKI and that blockade of the B1R or kallikrein inhibition can reduce 

the development of tubular injury and renal inflammation and improve not only renal 

function but also hemostatic abnormalities. Although AKI is a common consequence of 

accidental contact with L. obliqua caterpillars, the present study was the first to 

demonstrate both the importance of the KKS in venom-induced pathology and that the 

specific inhibition of the KKS may be a promising therapeutic option. To date, animal-

derived antivenoms have provided the only effective treatments for envenomation cases 

(Bon, 1996). Several laboratories throughout the continents manufacture antivenoms 

(Gutiérrez et al., 2010), which consist of whole IgG molecules or products of their 

enzymatic digestion, such as bivalent F(ab')2 or monovalent Fab (Lalloo and Theakston, 

2003; Theakston et al., 2003; Gutiérrez and León, 2009). Despite its efficacy, 

antivenom therapy has been associated with several problems, including the high cost of 

production; failures in the distribution of antivenom ampoules to localized, but distant, 

areas that have a high incidence of accidents and/or the low-income agrarian regions in 

which they are most needed; inadequate storage and transportation of antivenoms; and 

the lack of trained health workers who know how to use these products and conduct the 

appropriate clinical management of medical emergencies (Gutiérrez et al., 2010). 

Another serious problem is the adverse effects caused by antivenom therapy, including 

potentially life-threatening systemic disturbances, such as anaphylactic reactions, which 

occur quite frequently (Fan et al., 1999). The beneficial effects observed following 

treatment with the B1R antagonists in the present study are of particular interest for this 

reason. Due to the inducible nature of the B1R at the site of tissue injury, it has been 

suggested that blocking the proinflammatory B1R may lack significant adverse effects. 

This hypothesis has drawn attention to the B1R as a new therapeutic target for the 



Resultados 

181 

 

treatment of different pathologies, such as airway inflammation, diabetic neuropathy, 

brain ischemia, arthritis and neuropathic pain (Campos et al., 2006). 

 Previous data indicated that L. obliqua venom possesses kininogenase activity, 

being able to release BK from low molecular weight kininogen and activate plasma 

kallikrein in vitro (Bohrer et al., 2007). Kallikrein is also believed to be activated in 

vivo, because prekallikrein levels were decreased in the plasma of human victims 

(Zannin et al., 2003) and in experimental animals, and renal tissue kallikrein activity 

was increased in envenomed rats (as observed in the present study). In addition, the 

expression of kininogen increased in the kidneys during envenomation (Berger et al., 

unpublished data). Taken together, these results are in agreement with the hypothesis 

that BK is generated during envenomation and are also in accordance with the up-

regulation of renal B1R and B2R that was observed in the present study. The renal 

pathophysiological effects produced by locally generated BK can also be enhanced, 

because ACE expression was down-regulated during the first 24 h, and the 

vasoconstrictor axis of the renin-angiotensin system (formed by ACE/Ang II/ AT1R) 

(Bader et al., 2012) seems to be suppressed during envenomation. In fact, the 

expression of the AT1R, which is the receptor for the vasoconstrictor peptide Ang II, 

decreased during the first 24 h and remained unchanged between 48 and 96 h. In 

contrast, the vasodilator counter-regulatory axis, which consists of ACE2/Ang-(1-

7)/MAS (Passos-Silva et al., 2013), seems to be up-regulated during envenomation. 

Despite ACE2 expression only being slightly increased, MAS expression and the 

MAS/AT1R ratio increased significantly, suggesting that a vasodilatory profile 

predominated. The B1R and B2R also have dual effects on kidney hemodynamics. While 

BK mediates a vasorelaxant effect through the B2R, its metabolite, des-Arg
9
-BK, 

induces a renal vasoconstrictor response through the B1R (Guimarães et al., 1986; 

Vieira et al., 1994). The imbalance observed in the present study between renal 

B2R/B1R expression may be involved in renal hemodynamic alterations, mainly in the 

decrease of GFR. 

 Previous studies have demonstrated that KKS components are modulated in a 

similar fashion in different models of renal injury. BK receptors are induced during 

renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury, glomerulonephritis and obstructive 

nephropathy (Wang et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2009; Klein et al., 2010). In general, these 

models demonstrated that animals treated with B1R antagonists or B1R knockout are 

protected from kidney damage. The protection observed following B1R deletion or

antagonism was associated with the increased expression of anti-inflammatory 

molecules and the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic 

molecules (Wang et al., 2008; 2009; Klein et al., 2009). Interestingly, neither B2R 

deletion nor antagonism have been shown to be beneficial during renal ischemia-

reperfusion-induced injury (Wang et al., 2008). Similar results were obtained by Raslan 

et al. (2010), who observed reduced blood-brain barrier leakage and inflammation in 

mice lacking the B1R that had been subjected to cerebral ischemia, while animals 

lacking the B2R displayed no significant alterations in lesion formation or the 

development of brain edema. The data obtained in the present study lead us to believe 

that a similar mechanism occurred in L. obliqua-induced AKI, because significant 

improvements in glomerular function, tubular handling of water and renal 

hemodynamics were observed only under B1R, and not B2R, antagonism. Indeed, both 

DALBK and R-715 restored the levels of plasma creatinine, GFR, tubular water 

reabsorption, water imbalance, polyuria and proteinuria in envenomed animals. In 

addition, treatment with B1R antagonists also improved histopathological changes, 

preventing tubular necrosis, the formation of intratubular casts, renal inflammation, 

vascular leakage and edema. The inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by 

TNF-? and IL-1? seems to be critical for these beneficial effects, because B1R blockade 

reduced the renal levels of these cytokines. A similar beneficial effect was observed in 

envenomed animals treated with the kallikrein inhibitor, aprotinin, confirming that the 

production of BK through kallikrein activation plays a central role in the renal injury 

elicited by this venom. The indirect activation of the KKS appears to be an essential 

mechanism by which L. obliqua venom leads to AKI. In other words, despite the 

presence of several toxins that are potentially cytotoxic (Veiga et al., 2005; Ricci-Silva 

et al., 2008), a direct cytotoxic effect of the venom on renal cells makes a minor 

contribution, because blocking BK generation or even B1R activation is enough to 

prevent the progression of renal disease. 

 The mechanisms involved in B1R up-regulation during venom-induced AKI 

remain unknown, although evidence provided by other studies has indicated that B1R 

induction is controlled by many pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, 

including IL-1?, TNF-?, and interferon gamma, as well as epidermal growth factor 

(Calixto et al., 2004; Rocha et al., 2005; Klein et al., 2010). Clear evidence now exists 

indicating that the induction of the B1R by many of these factors involves the activation 

of the transcription factor NF-?B, and, conversely, that B1R stimulation activates NF-

?B (Medeiros et al., 2001; 2004; Calixto et al., 2004). An intense inflammatory 

response is a common feature of L. obliqua envenomation. Systemically, the venom 

induces neutrophilic leukocytosis, while in the kidneys, the occurrence of cellular 

inflammatory infiltrate, edema, increases in vascular permeability and the up-regulation 

of several proteins associated with the acute phase of inflammatory signaling and 

nephritis have been described (Berger et al., unpublished data). In vitro, when incubated 

with human fibroblasts or endothelial cells in culture, L. obliqua venom induces the 

production of several cytokines, including TNF-? and IL-1?, and also activates NF-?B 

and increases the expression of inflammatory inducible enzymes, such as COX-2, 

iNOS, and HO-1 (Pinto et al., 2008; Nascimento-Silva et al., 2012). In the present 

study, we also observed high levels of TNF-? and IL-1? in the kidneys of envenomed 

animals. Therefore, we propose that pro-inflammatory stimuli are the main factors 

underlying B1R induction during envenomation. Moreover, once activated, the B1R 

stimulates the release of more TNF-? and IL-1?, amplifying the inflammatory response 

and leading to leukocyte accumulation and the production of prostaglandins, reactive 

oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) (Kayashima et al., 2012). As demonstrated 

previously, the intravascular NO levels increased during experimental envenomation in 

rats. NO production is associated with venom-induced platelet hypoaggregation, as 

evidenced by the fact that L-NAME restores platelet aggregation ability (Berger et al., 

2010). In the present study, plasma NO levels also increased, along with the levels in 

the kidneys, and both B1R and B2R antagonism blocked NO production. However, 

despite the evident participation of NO in platelet aggregation disturbances, it seems 

that NO plays a minor role in kidney injury. B2R antagonism inhibits NO production, 

but does not prevent renal functional and morphological alterations.   

 In addition to renal alterations, L. obliqua envenomation is also characterized by 

several hemostatic disturbances. Both human patients and experimental animals 

displayed signs of consumption coagulopathy with blood incoagulability, prolonged 

coagulation times, low fibrinogen levels and platelet hypoaggregation (Zannin et al., 

2003; Berger et al., 2010). The venom contains specific toxins that are able to directly 

activate blood and fibrinolytic cascades, which ultimately contribute to fibrinogen 

consumption and blood incoagulability (Reis et al., 2001; Pinto et al., 2004). 

Surprisingly, in addition to preventing renal alterations, B1R antagonism was also 

beneficial to blood incoagulability, because animals pretreated with DALBK or R-715 

had similar coagulation times to those in controls that received only PBS. However,

when fibrinogen consumption was analyzed, we observed only partial protection during 

B1R antagonism, while the procoagulant activity of renal tissue factor decreased 

slightly. The mechanism involved in the beneficial effects of B1R blockade remains 

unknown and requires further investigation. However, because systemic inflammation 

leads to coagulation activation (Esmon, 2004), we speculate that inhibiting the pro-

inflammatory signaling triggered by B1R activation may not completely prevent 

fibrinogen consumption, but it may maintain a basal level of circulating fibrinogen, 

which may be sufficient to avoid blood incoagulability and the consequent delay in 

coagulation time. Aprotinin pretreatment was also able to efficiently prevent 

coagulation disturbances. In this case, the beneficial effect was expected because 

activated kallikrein is known to trigger the intrinsic coagulation pathway by directly 

activating factor XII (Shariat-Madar et al., 2002; Renné, 2012). Thus, by inhibiting 

kallikrein during envenomation, it is possible to counteract the progression of renal 

injury and consumption coagulopathy.   

 Taken together, the results of the present study revealed that B1R blockade or 

kallikrein inhibition improves renal function during L. obliqua-induced AKI by 

reducing tubular necrosis, renal inflammation, and the production of pro-inflammatory 

cytokines, and ameliorates the coagulopathy commonly observed during this type of 

envenomation. Thus, the present study provides consistent evidence linking KKS 

activation to L. obliqua-induced AKI, and indicates that the inhibition of KKS 

components (mainly kallikrein inhibition or B1R antagonism) may be a therapeutic 

alternative that can be used to control the progression of renal injury during such 

envenomation.

4. DISCUSSÃO 

 

 A patologia desencadeada pelos envenenamentos com animais peçonhentos é 

complexa e decorrente não só da ação direta das diferentes toxinas presentes nos 

venenos em tecidos ou sistemas específicos, mas também é resultado da resposta do 

organismo à lesão provocada por essas toxinas. Neste trabalho, demonstramos que o 

veneno da taturana Lonomia obliqua, reconhecidamente de efeito hemorrágico devido à 

presença de toxinas pró- e anticoagulantes, é capaz de induzir, além das alterações na 

hemostasia, uma síndrome de toxicidade sistêmica onde há lesão de múltiplos órgãos. 

Dentre estes órgãos, o rim é um dos mais afetados, tendo, ademais, importância clínica 

significativa considerando os casos de vítimas envenenadas. Devido à incidência e 

aumento da mortalidade associado ao desenvolvimento de lesão renal após o contato 

com a taturana, empenhamos esforços na investigação da patogênese dessa doença em 

um modelo experimental in vivo em ratos. Os dados obtidos apontam para um 

mecanismo multifatorial onde a hemólise, a ativação do sistema calicreína-cininas 

(SCC) e alterações vasculares mostraram ser componentes fundamentais no 

desenvolvimento da insuficiência renal aguda (IRA) induzida pelo veneno de L. 

obliqua. De acordo com os resultados apresentados nos capítulos anteriores, a Figura 9 

mostra as possíveis vias envolvidas no desenvolvimento da lesão renal. A seguir, uma 

breve discussão integrativa acerca dos mecanismos da IRA neste tipo de 

envenenamento é apresentada.  

 

Hemólise. Hemólise intensa ou rabdomiólise podem estar associadas ao 

desenvolvimento de IRA principalmente devido à nefrotoxicidade do heme liberado a 

partir da hemoglobina (Hb) ou mioglobina (Mb) (ZAGER, 1996; SITPRIJA, 2006). O 

heme é uma molécula altamente citotóxica, proinflamatória e prooxidante que está 

envolvida em uma série de patologias incluindo sepse, malária, lesões isquêmicas, 

hemorragia pulmonar e cerebral e anemia falciforme (FERREIRA et al., 2008; TRACZ 

et al., 2007; PAMPLONA et al., 2007; LARA et al., 2009; LARSEN et al., 2010; 

SIMÕES et al., 2013). Em condições normais, a Hb ou Mb livre na circulação é 

removida pela ligação à haptoglobina (Hpt) e o heme pela ligação à hemopexina (Hpx). 

A formação dos complexos Hb-Hpt ou Mb-Hpt e heme-Hpx neutralizam os efeitos 

prooxidantes e proinflamatórios do heme e, dessa forma, são direcionados para as

células do fígado, ligam-se a receptores específicos e são reutilizados para a síntese de 

novas moléculas de Hb e Mb para os eritrócitos e células musculares, respectivamente 

(ZAGER et al., 2012). Entretanto, em condições onde há hemólise ou rabdomiólise 

intensa, tanto a Hpt quanto a Hpx são consumidas, sua quantidade diminui no plasma e 

há um acúmulo de Hb ou Mb e heme livres na circulação. Durante o envenenamento por 

L. obliqua, ocorre liberação de Hb a partir dos eritrócitos devido ao efeito hemolítico do 

veneno in vitro e in vivo (SEIBERT et al., 2004; 2006). A liberação de Mb também 

pode ocorrer, pois o veneno tem atividade miotóxica e cardiotóxica, apesar de não 

induzir rabdomiólise intensa como observado em outros envenenamentos como por 

Crotalus sp., por exemplo, que se caracterizam por fraqueza muscular generalizada. 

Como mostrado nesta tese, quantidades significativas de Hb acumulam-se no plasma 

dos ratos envenenados, há redução do número de eritrócitos e Hpt circulantes, presença 

de eritrócitos fragmentados no esfregaço sanguíneo, aumento dos reticulócitos, 

eritrofagocitose e deposição de hemosiderina no baço, acúmulo de eritrócitos e Hb nos 

túbulos renais, hematúria e hemoglobinúria. Especificamente no rim, a expressão da 

heme-oxigenase 1 (HO-1), Hpx e ferritina aumentam, indicando que o metabolismo do 

heme está ativado durante o envenenamento. Uma vez reabsorvido pelas células 

tubulares, o heme é catabolizado pelo sistema da HO-1, gerando quantidades 

equimolares de biliverdina, monóxido de carbono (CO) e ferro livre (CAMARA &amp;amp; 

SOARES, 2005; LARSEN et al., 2010). A biliverdina ainda é convertida em bilirrubina 

pela biliverdina redutase e o ferro livre, por ser um potente agente prooxidante, é 

neutralizado formando um complexo com a ferritina (KUMAR &amp;amp; 

BANDYOPADHYAY, 2005). Na presença de pequenas quantidades de heme, esse 

sistema da HO-1 é efetivo em proteger as células tubulares. No entanto, como é grande 

o acúmulo de Hb e eritrócitos nos túbulos durante o envenenamento, possivelmente o 

sistema da HO-1 esteja saturado. Com isso, os níveis de bilirrubina aumentam no 

plasma e o ferro livre não complexado à ferritina gera espécies reativas de oxigênio 

(EROs) responsáveis por lesão tissular (ZAGER, 1996). De fato, em nossos 

experimentos, observamos que a expressão de várias enzimas antioxidantes aumentam 

no rim juntamente com as atividades de superóxido dismutase, catalase e peroxidase 

(dados não mostrados) que também aumentam no rim de animais envenenados, 

indicando a produção de EROs. O aumento na geração de EROs ainda pode estar 

correlacionado com diferentes eventos observados ao longo do envenenamento, tais 

como (i) as quebras duplas detectadas no DNA de células renais de animais

envenenados que, pelos nossos resultados, parecem ser efetivamente mediadas por 

EROs; (ii) o aumento na expressão de enzimas de reparo de DNA; e (iii) a presença de 

uma série de marcadores de lesão tecidual incluindo marcadores de necrose e apoptose 

que foram detectados nos rins (Figura 9). Além disso, já foi demonstrado que o heme 

livre, mesmo antes de ser metabolizado pelo sistema da HO-1, também pode mediar a 

produção de EROs via NADPH-oxidase e induzir a expressão de citocinas 

proinflamatórias (IL-1?, IL-6 e TNF-?) pela ativação do fator de transcrição NF-?B 

(GRAÇA-SOUZA et al., 2002; ARRUDA et al., 2004; SIMÕES et al., 2013).  

 

Ativação do sistema calicreína-cininas. O veneno de L. obliqua é capaz de ativar a pré-

calicreína no plasma e liberar BK diretamente a partir do LMWK. Portanto, a BK pode 

ser gerada durante o envenenamento por atividade direta de uma cininogenase do 

veneno sobre o LMWK ou pela ação da calicreína ativada sobre o HMWK (BOHRER 

et al., 2007) (Figura 9). A BK assim gerada e também seus metabólitos ativos, 

respondem por uma série de efeitos observados no envenenamento, incluindo edema, 

inflamação, dor e hipotensão (DE CASTRO BASTOS et al., 2004; BOHRER et al., 

2007). Os resultados aqui apresentados acrescentam que essa ativação do SCC também 

é de fundamental importância para o desenvolvimento da IRA durante o 

envenenamento. A expressão dos genes codificadores de ambos os receptores de BK 

(B1R e B2R) está aumentada no rim. Verificamos, todavia, que somente o antagonismo 

de B1R ou a inibição de calicreína são capazes de prevenir as alterações funcionais e 

morfológicas renais e o desequilíbrio hidroeletrolítico causado pelo envenenamento. O 

tratamento prévio com antagonistas de B2R não é capaz de proteger contra os efeitos 

nefrotóxicos do veneno. Ou seja, tanto a ativação de calicreína quanto do B1R são 

essenciais para os efeitos deletérios do veneno sobre o rim. Resultados semelhantes 

foram descritos em outros modelos de IRA incluindo nefropatia diabética, lesão renal 

por isquemia-reperfusão, glomerulonefrite e fibrose renal (KAKOKI et al., 2004; 

WANG et al., 2008; KLEIN et al., 2009; KLEIN et al., 2010). Especificamente em 

modelo de isquemia-reperfusão renal, animais nocautes para B1R apresentam menores 

níveis de creatinina plasmática, melhora da lesão tubular e inflamação, aumento na 

expressão de citocinas anti-inflamatórias, como IL-4 e IL-10, e redução na expressão de 

citocinas pró-inflamatórias, como IL-1? e TNF-? (WANG et al., 2006; 2008). Em 

modelos de glomerulonefrite, fibrose renal e mesmo em biópsias de pacientes com 

glomerulonefrite o B1R tem sua expressão aumentada e o bloqueio deste receptor 



Discussão

associa-se a uma redução na expressão de citocinas profibróticas, como o TGF-? e 

CTGF, e quimiocinas responsáveis pelo recrutamento de macrófagos/monócitos, como 

a MCP-1 e MCP-3 (KLEIN et al., 2009; WANG et al., 2009; KLEIN et al., 2010). 

Portanto, a ausência ou o bloqueio do B1R parece estar relacionado diretamente a uma 

diminuição do processo inflamatório no rim. Nos animais envenenados a melhora na 

função renal provavelmente também esteja relacionada a uma redução da inflamação, já 

que o bloqueio de B1R reduz o acúmulo de células inflamatórias, edema, 

extravasamento vascular e a expressão de IL-1? e TNF-? no rim. De fato, estudos 

relacionados com B1R demonstraram que sua expressão apresenta importante função, 

principalmente na manutenção da inflamação (CALIXTO et al., 2004; MARCEAU E 

REGOLI, 2004), e os efeitos proinflamatórios dos B1R incluem dor, edema e aumento 

do trânsito de leucócitos para as regiões inflamadas (COUTURE et al., 2001). Citocinas 

proinflamatórias e a ativação de componentes da família MAPK estão envolvidos na 

regulação e indução de expressão do gene que codifica para o B1R. A região promotora 

do gene codificador de B1R tem sítios de ligação para o fator transcricional NF-?B, o 

qual parece ser essencial para o controle da transcrição deste gene após a exposição a 

agentes inflamatórios como, por exemplo, IL-1?, TNF-? e LPS (MEDEIROS et al., 

2004). Dessa forma, uma vez ativado, o B1R induz a translocação de NF-?B para o 

núcleo, o qual será responsável pelo aumento não só da expressão do próprio gene de 

B1R, mas também de uma série de citocinas, quimiocinas e prostaglandinas que, em 

última instância mediarão a migração de células inflamatórias para o tecido lesado, a 

formação de edema, dor e produção de EROs (PASSOS et al., 2004; KAYASHIMA et 

al., 2012) (Figura 9).  

 De forma interessante, tanto o bloqueio farmacológico do B1R quanto a inibição 

sistêmica de calicreína também protegeram os animais das alterações de coagulação 

sanguínea que são comuns no envenenamento por L. obliqua. No caso da inibição de 

calicreína, este efeito benéfico pode ser explicado pelo fato de que a calicreína ativa na 

circulação, além de gerar BK, pode também disparar a coagulação pela ativação de fator 

XII (SHARIAT-MADAR et al., 2002) (Figura 9). Entretanto, a ativação do B1R não 

tem aparentemente qualquer relação direta conhecida com a coagulação. Uma hipótese 

plausível é que a produção de citocinas proinflamatórias mediadas pelo B1R possam 

ativar a coagulação e/ou inibir os mecanismos anticoagulantes endógenos que limitam a 

resposta protrombótica, já que inflamação e coagulação são processos intimamente 

relacionados (MASSBERG et al., 2010; RENNÉ, 2012). Por exemplo, a produção de 



Discussão 

203 

 

TNF-? estimulada por LPS induz um perfil protrombótico, pois aumenta a expressão de 

fator tecidual e ao mesmo tempo inibe a via da proteína C e trombomodulina, que são 

importantes anticoagulantes endógenos (ESMON, 2004). Além disso, o estímulo 

inflamatório resulta na ativação do sistema complemento e eleva os níveis do inibidor 

do ativador de plasminogênio (PAI-1), portanto diminuindo a fibrinólise e axacerbando 

a coagulação e a coagulopatia de consumo (ESMON, 2004; SCHOUTEN et al., 2008). 

De acordo com esta hipótese, de fato encontramos, além da resposta inflamatória 

intensa, níveis aumentados de PAI-1 e dos componentes C3 e D do complemento e, 

também, uma atividade aumentada de fator tissular nos rins de animais envenenados.  

 

Alterações vasculares. O processo de ultrafiltração do plasma nos glomérulos 

caracteriza-se basicamente pela passagem seletiva de água, eletrólitos e pequenas 

moléculas para o espaço de Bowman, enquanto os elementos figurados do sangue e as 

proteínas dissolvidas no plasma ficam retidos. A energia para esse processo provém 

essencialmente do trabalho cardíaco e depende da pressão arterial sistêmica e da pressão 

na microvasculatura renal (ZATZ, 2000). Dessa forma, a variação da pressão 

hidrostática nos capilares glomerulares interfere no ritmo que acontece o processo de 

filtração. Nos capilares glomerulares, a pressão hidrostática é regulada pela variação do 

diâmetro das arteríolas aferente e eferente e, portanto, pela resistência oferecida por 

esses vasos. Quando a resistência da arteríola aferente decresce (por vasodilatação), a 

pressão hidrostática dentro do capilar glomerular (PCG) aumenta, pois uma maior fração 

da pressão arterial renal é transmitida ao capilar glomerular. O aumento da PCG eleva o 

ritmo de filtração glomerular (RFG). Já quando a resistência na arteríola aferente 

aumenta (por vasoconstrição), a PCG diminui e o RFG também se reduz. Na arteríola 

eferente, quando a resistência é diminuída, como quando relaxada, acontece diminuição 

da PCG e do RFG. Por outro lado, quando há constrição na arteríola eferente, observa-se 

um aumento da PCG e do RFG (ZATZ, 2000). Em situações normais, existe um processo 

de autorregulação do RFG que o mantém em valores relativamente estáveis mesmo que 

ocorram flutuações na pressão arterial (CUPPLES and BRAAM, 2007). No entanto, 

quando há vasodilatação sistêmica ou hemorragia, a pressão arterial pode cair bastante e 

ficar fora dos limiares da autorregulação. Nesse caso normalmente ocorre uma 

vasoconstrição na arteríola aferente, como parte da tentativa do organismo de denfender 

a sua volemia, e, consequentemente, redução da PCG e do RFG (ZATZ, 2000; 

SCHRIER et al., 2004). A principal evidência de que um mecanismo semelhante tenha 



Discussão 

204 

 

parte na queda acentuada do RFG observada nos animais envenenados, além, 

obviamente, da hemorragia, é a hipotensão (Figura 9). Após a injeção do veneno, há 

uma queda progressiva da pressão arterial nas primeiras 12 h e os animais permanecem 

hipotensos entre 24 e 96 h, período em que também é observada a maior queda no RFG. 

Apesar da diminuição acentuada do RFG, o desbalanço hídrico com o aumento 

concomitante da fração de excreção de água e eletrólitos também observado nos animais 

envenenados pode, pelo menos em parte, contribuir para a queda de pressão arterial 

(Figura 9). Estes resultados indicam que os néfrons deixaram de desempenhar 

adequadamente suas funções: não estão ávidos por sódio, não parecem estar secretando 

potássio em quantidade significativa, nem estão empenhados em concentrar a urina para 

reter água. Em outras palavras, não parece estar havendo um processamento da pequena 

quantidade de filtrado glomerular que ainda se forma. Assim, como a capacidade de 

reabsorção tubular está diminuída boa parte do filtrado formado é eliminado e ocorre 

poliúria mesmo com o RFG baixo. Na prática clínica, esse tipo de quadro é conhecido 

como IRA não-oligúrica (ou IRA poliúrica) e, apesar do evidente comprometimento 

renal em tal situação, ainda assim é considerada de bom prognóstico se comparada à 

IRA oligúrica ou anúrica (ZATZ et al., 2000). A diferença básica está no grau de lesão 

tubular a que cada condição está associada. Na IRA oligúrica a extensão da necrose 

tubular é grande, de forma que em vários pontos do rim as células tubulares aparecem 

necrosadas ou ausentes, restando aos túbulos, em certos segmentos, apenas a membrana 

basal. Isso permite o vazamento puro e simples do filtrado de volta ao interstício. Ou 

seja, o filtrado não é reabsorvido e nem eliminado corretamente. Já na IRA não-

oligúrica, a extensão da necrose tubular é menor e regiões necrosadas contrastam com 

outras menos comprometidas (geralmente na área medular). O resultado é que, apesar 

da incapacidade de reabsorção de água e eletrólitos, o filtrado permanece no interior dos 

túbulos e é eliminado. Assim, o débito urinário se mantém (ou até mesmo aumenta), 

produzindo uma urina completamente diluída (THADHANI et al., 1996; SCHRIER et 

al., 2004).    

 Tanto a ativação da coagulação quanto do SCC também podem interferir na 

hemodinâmica glomerular e contribuir para a redução do RFG (Figura 9). Independente 

da PCG, se há lesão endotelial e deposição de fibrina no capilar, o fluxo sanguíneo pode 

sofrer uma redução e, como o processo de filtração também é diretamente proporcional 

ao fluxo, o RFG cai. Já as cininas geradas pela ativação do SCC alteram 

significativamente a resistência vascular renal. Em rim isolado de rato perfundido com

205 

 

BK ou lys-BK observa-se um efeito bifásico de vasodilatação e vasoconstrição. Em uma 

primeira fase, ocorre vasodilatação mediada pela ligação da BK ou Lys-BK ao B2R e 

dependente da produção de prostaglandinas. Na segunda fase, ocorre vasoconstrição 

mediada pela ligação de des-Arg

-BK ou Lys-des-Arg

-BK (geradas a partir de BK ou 

Lys-BK) ao B1R e totalmente independente da produção de prostaglandinas 

(GUIMARÃES et al., 1986a,b; VIEIRA et al., 1994; REN et al., 2002). In vivo durante 

o envenenamento é difícil prever qual desses efeitos é predominante e, portanto, 

realmente interfere no RFG. O fato é que a expressão de ambos os receptores de BK 

aumenta ao longo do envenenamento (Figura 9), mas somente o bloqueio do B1R é 

capaz de prevenir a queda do RFG. Talvez o bloqueio do B1R favoreça o efeito 

vasodilatador mediado pelo B2R no rim, diminua a resistência vascular e facilite o 

processo de filtração. É possível que investigações futuras e o uso de outras 

metodologias como o rim isolado, por exemplo, auxiliem a esclarecer a real influência 

dos receptores de BK nas alterações hemodinâmicas renais induzidas pelo veneno.

? O veneno da taturana Lonomia obliqua induz, além da síndrome hemorrágica 

característica, importantes alterações bioquímicas, hematológicas e 

histopatológicas, indicando que ocorre lesão de múltiplos órgãos ao longo do 

envenenamento. Essas lesões parecem estar relacionadas principalmente à 

coagulopatia de consumo e aos efeitos hemolítico, proinflamatório, nefrotóxico, 

miotóxico, cardiotóxico e genotóxico do veneno. O dano genotóxico em 

particular parece ser mediado pela produção de espécies reativas de oxigênio ; 

 

? O soro antilonômico é capaz de neutralizar os efeitos tóxicos sistêmicos do 

veneno apenas se administrado no início do envenenamento (nas primeiras 2 h). 

Se administrado após 6 h de envenenamento, o soro é ineficaz em neutralizar o 

dano renal, cardíaco e o efeito hemolítico, apesar de reverter a coagulopatia de 

consumo;  

 

? Especificamente no rim, as alterações morfológicas são compatíveis com 

necrose tubular aguda. Há obstrução tubular e o desenvolvimento da lesão renal 

induzida pelo envenenamento está relacionada com alterações hemodinâmicas 

incluindo hipotensão sistêmica, aumento do débito cardíaco, aumento da 

permeabilidade vascular renal, redução do ritmo de filtração glomerular e 

alterações tubulares como redução da capacidade de reabsorção de água e 

eletrólitos; 

 

? Marcadores de lesão tubular são encontrados nos rins e urina dos animais 

envenenados. A expressão de proteínas associadas com inflamação, dano 

oxidativo, reparo de DNA, metabolismo e detoxificação de hemoglobina, heme 

e ferro estão aumentadas no rim de animais envenenados. Marcadores que 

indicam ativação da coagulação, complemento e do sistema calicreína-cininas 

também estão presentes no rim de ratos envenenados; 



Conclusão 

209 

 

? Toxinas do veneno são detectadas no rim, endotélio, tecido conjuntivo 

perivascular e urina. 

 

? A ativação do sistema calicreína-cininas parece ter um papel fundamental para o 

desenvolvimento da insuficiência renal aguda no envenenamento por L. obliqua; 

 

? O bloqueio da atividade da calicreína ou do receptor B1 de bradicinina é capaz 

de previnir a maioria das alterações morfológicas e funcionais renais e o 

desenvolvimento da coagulopatia de consumo, constituindo-se, portanto, em 

uma alternativa terapêutica para o tratamento do envenenamento;  

 

? O efeito protetor do antagonismo do receptor B1 de bradicinina ou a inibição 

sistêmica de calicreína possivelmente está associado a uma diminuição do 

processo inflamatório no rim e a redução da liberação de citocinas 

proinflamatórias como TNF-? e IL-1?.

Received 1 March 2012; revised 13 August 2012; accepted 13 August 2012

Background: Loxosceles genus (brown spider) is an important pest with great impact on public health. Thus,
more effective strategies for spider control are necessary.

Methods: Three isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae fungus were tested for the control of Loxosceles sp.

Results: Metarhizium anisopliae isolate E6 was highly virulent to the Loxosceles sp. spider, causing 100% mor-
tality at 109 conidia/ml after 12 days and 9 days for juvenile and adult spiders, respectively.

Conclusions: This is the first report of the pathogenicity of M. anisopliae against a venomous arthropod. This
fungus could offer an interesting alternative to reduce loxoscelism in future biocontrol strategies.

Keywords: Loxosceles sp., Loxoscelism, Biological control, Metarhizium anisopliae

Introduction
Bites of brown spiders (Loxosceles spp.) cause a severe clinical
profile associated with dermonecrotic lesions and systemic man-
ifestations that may be intense and occasionally fatal.1 These
spiders have a worldwide distribution, and accidents have been
described mainly in developing countries. Some urban regions
around the world, such as the metropolitan area of Curitiba
city, Brazil, have thousands of cases of loxoscelism (accidents
caused by spiders of the genus Loxosceles) reported per year,
and it is an important health problem with great economic
impact on the public health system.1 Population control strat-
egies for these and other spiders are unspecific and are mostly
based on the use of insecticides. In this scenario, re-infestation
is a continuous problem and the toxic side effects of indiscrimin-
ate use of insecticides for humans have to be considered. Thus,
alternative strategies that are more effective to control brown
spider populations and the consequent occurrences of loxosce-
lism have recently gained considerable importance.

The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, a biocontrol agent that is
an arthropod pathogen but is not infectious to humans, has been
applied safely for several decades in the control of agricultural
pests and other arthropods of medical relevance.2 – 4 In this
work, the susceptibility of the brown spider (Loxosceles sp.) to
M. anisopliae is presented.

Materials and methods
Metarhizium anisopliae isolate E6 (from the hemipteran insect Deois
flavopicta, Esp??rito Santo, Brazil, 1981), isolate Nordeste (from the

hemipteran insect Mahanarva posticata, Pernambuco, Brazil,
1969) and isolate AL (from M. posticata, Alagoas state, Brazil,
1995) were maintained in the laboratory (Universidade Federal do
Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). Conidia production and
conidial suspensions were performed as described previously.5

Loxosceles sp. spiders were collected on different days (during
December 2010 – March 2011) from a highly infested and inhab-
ited house in the city of Viama?o, RS, Brazil, with the owner’s author-
isation and only for the bioassays. Spiders were exposed before
assay to dead ants (Atta sp.) as a food source and were maintained
for ?20 days at 28 8C for observation of their health condition.
Spiders were maintained individually in 50 ml plastic tubes
covered with screen tissues with free access to sterile water
through wet cotton flakes at the bottom of tubes before the bio-
assay procedure.

For bioassays, 10 adult and 10 juvenile Loxosceles sp. individuals
were used per treatment. Metarhizium anisopliae conidial suspen-
sion (2 ml) was applied through sprinkling to cover the total body
of the spider (at three concentrations of 107, 108 or 109 conidia/
ml). Following fungal inoculation, the spiders were individually
placed in tubes covered with screen tissues at 28 8C and .90% rela-
tive humidity in a biochemical oxygen demand incubator. Controls
consisted of Loxosceles sp. spiders treated with sterile distilled
water instead of the conidial suspension. Experiments were
carried out in three replicates and spiders were observed daily to
determine survival. Bioassays were evaluated for 25 days. Statistical
analysis, including analysis of Probit for dependent results, was con-
ducted to obtain the lethal concentration (LC50 and LC90) and lethal
time (LT50 and LT90) for 50% and 90% of the spiders, respectively,
using SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
Comparing three M. anisopliae isolates (E6, Nordeste and AL), it
was observed that isolate E6 caused 100% mortality following ap-
plication of 109 conidia/ml after 12 days and 9 days of treatment
for juvenile and adult spiders, respectively, being considered highly
virulent to Loxosceles sp. (Table 1). Isolate Nordeste showed lower
virulence (100% mortality in 19 days for juveniles and 13 days for
adults at 109 conidia/ml), whilst isolate AL was not virulent at all
concentrations tested. For all isolates tested, a concentration of
107 conidia/ml caused a low mortality rate (Table 1). Interestingly,
the most effective isolate (E6) also caused 100% mortality for
adult spiders at a concentration of 108 conidia/ml (15 days). In
all experiments, the survival rate in the brown spider control
group was 100%. All dead spiders infected with M. anisopliae
developed intense surface mycosis (Supplementary Figure 1). No
fungal growth was observed in the control spiders.

Adults were more susceptible to fungal infection compared
with juvenile spiders, as evidenced by the LT50 and LT90 values.
In some cases, especially for isolate AL, mortality values were
,50% at the end of experiment; thus, LT50 and LT90 values could
not be calculated. LC50 values on day 25 post treatment for the
most infective M. anisopliae isolate (E6) were 4.9×107 and 8.9×
106 conidia/ml for juvenile and adult spiders, respectively (Table 1).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the effect of a
fungus to control a venomous spider of medical relevance. We
have shown in vitro that the fungus M. anisopliae can be used
to control juvenile and adult Loxosceles sp. spiders, especially
fungal isolate E6. Biocontrol strategies with M. anisopliae are con-
sidered of low impact in nature because this fungus is specific to
its arthropod target host.4 Moreover, use of biocontrol agents
decreases the application of chemical pesticides, which greatly
impact on the environment, humans and animals.

Metarhizium anisopliae appears to be a promising alternative
to unspecific chemical insecticides in use owing to its verified ef-
ficacy in Loxosceles sp. infection and control. The potential use of
this fungus might be its application inside homes in specific sites
associated with the brown spider’s lifestyle, such as basements,
garages, behind and under furniture, and baseboards. It could
also be a good alternative for highly infested areas in abandoned
constructions, wastelands, warehouses, deposits and sheds.
Metarhizium anisopliae can be applied directly in the field or at
specific sites through pulverisation. Another way to apply the
fungus in biocontrol in domestic areas might be the use of dry
conidia associated with any kind of spider attractant, allowing
contact of conidia onto the spider’s body, like a spider trap.

Development of specific strategies based on the use of M. ani-
sopliae conidia and treatment of highly infested sites by Loxos-
celes sp. with a conidial suspension could be an alternative for
spider population control, consequently reducing loxoscelism in
Brazil and other countries.

ABSTRACT The triterpene chikusetsusaponin IVa was isolated from the fruit of Ilex paraguariensis. Using biochemical

and pharmacological methods, we demonstrated that chikusetsusaponin IVa (1) prolongs the recalcification time, prothrombin

time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time of normal human plasma in a dose-dependent manner, (2)

inhibits the amidolytic activity of thrombin and factor Xa upon synthetic substrates S2238 and S2222, (3) inhibits thrombin-

induced fibrinogen clotting (50% inhibition concentration, 199.4 – 9.1 lM), and (4) inhibits thrombin- and collagen-induced
platelet aggregation. The results also indicate that chikusetsusaponin IVa preferentially inhibits thrombin in a competitive

manner (Ki = 219.6 lM). Furthermore, when administered intravenously to rats, chikusetsusaponin IVa inhibited thrombus
formation in a stasis model of venous thrombosis, although it did not induce a significant bleeding effect. Chikusetsusaponin

IVa also prolonged the ex vivo activated partial thromboplastin time. Altogether, these data suggest that chikusetsusaponin IVa

exerts antithrombotic effects, including minor hemorrhagic events. This appears to be important for the development of new

therapeutic agents.

KEY WORDS: ? chikusetsusaponin ? hemostasis ? Ilex paraguariensis ? platelet aggregation ? thrombosis ? thrombin

INTRODUCTION

Thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases are themajor causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western
world and frequently involve a prothrombotic state such as
myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherosclerosis.1 Antic-
oagulant and antithrombotic agents, such as heparin, vitamin
K antagonists, and acetylsalicylic acid, are currently used to
treat and prevent these thromboembolic events.2 Consider-
ing the high incidence of side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal
bleeding and thrombocytopenia), important efforts have
been made to find new antithrombotic substances.2–5

In the context of hemostasis, glycyrrhizin [3-O-(2-O-b-
d-glucopyranuronosyl-a-d-glucopyranuronosyl)-18b-gly-
cyrrhetinic acid (GL)] (Fig. 1), a triterpenoid saponin
obtained from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra, presented
anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects. GL prolonged the
in vitro coagulation time and inhibited the thrombin-induced

clotting of plasma and fibrinogen.6 In addition, the GL an-
tithrombotic effect was also observed in animal models of
thrombosis.7

Ilex paraguariensis, a South American tree of the Aqui-
foliaceae family, is rich in saponins (approximately 10%).8

Dried leaves and twigs from this tree are used to prepare a
tea known as mate? that is commonly consumed in Brazil,
Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. The saponins isolated
from its leaves are glycosides derived mainly from ursolic
and oleanolic acids.8 Other triterpenoid glycosides were
isolated from the fruits of I. paraguariensis.9 Pentacyclic
triterpenoids such as ursolic and oleanolic acids and their
derivatives possess pharmacological properties, such as
anti-human immunodeficiency virus, hepatoprotective, anti-
inflammatory, antimalarial, antiglycation, and cytotoxic ef-
fects,10–12 suggesting their potential use for the design of
new bioactive compounds. In this sense, the triterpenoid
chikusetsusaponins (identified by numbers I–IV) possess
several pharmacological activities such as anti-inflamma-
tory,13 antiviral,14 fibrinolytic,15 and anticancer16–18 prop-
erties. In particular, chikusetsusaponin IVa has also been
isolated from other species of Ilex, such as Ilex dumosa,19

Ilex pubescens,13 and Ilex rotunda.20

In the present study, we describe the in vitro and in vivo
anticoagulant and antiplatelet activity of chikusetsusaponin
IVa (Fig. 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Drugs and reagents

Bovine fibrinogen, human factor Xa, bovine type I col-
lagen, ADP, and GL were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Arachidonic acid was purchased
from Chrono-Log Co. (Havertown, PA, USA). Human a-
thrombin was purified from plasma of healthy volunteer
donors according to the precedure of Ngai and Chang.21

Synthetic substrates for thrombin (S2238 [H-d-Phe-
Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide]) and factor Xa (S2222 [Benzyl-
Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide]) were purchased from
Chromogenix ( Milan, Italy). Anasedan? (xylazine) and
Dopalen? (ketamine) were purchased from Crista?lia Pro-
dutos Qu??micos Farmace?uticos (Sa?o Paulo, Brazil). Calcium
thromboplastin was purchased from Wiener Lab (Rosario,
Argentina).

Apparatus

Mass spectrometry experiments were carried out using a
Micromass/Waters ( Milford, MA, USA) quadrupole-time
of flight mass spectrometer microequipped with a nano-
electrospray ionization source. Data were analyzed with the
Waters MassLynx software. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance were recorded on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA)
Inova spectrometer (300 MHz) in CD3OD. The spectro-
photometer used was a SpectraMax ( Molecular Devices
Co., Sunnyvale, CA, USA), equipped with temperature
control and shaking systems.

Isolation and structural elucidation of saponin

Fruits of I. paraguariensis A. St. Hil. were harvested in a
cultivated area in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. A voucher
specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil,
as voucher number ICN/UFRGS (163413). The hydro-
ethanolic extract was prepared using 10 g of dried and
powdered fruits in 40% ethanol by maceration (1:10,
plant:solvent). After evaporation of the solvent, the extract
was subjected to chromatography on a silica gel column
( Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using gradient mixtures of
chloroform:ethanol:water. Fractions were collected and
pooled according to thin-layer chromatography (silica gel
GF254; chloroform:ethanol:water, 40:40:5 by volume). Then

pooled fractions were subjected to further purification,
separately, using Lichroprep? ( Merck; particle size,
40–63 lm) and gradient mixtures of water:ethanol as eluate.
Pure saponin was obtained (90 mg), corresponding to 2% of
the dried ethanolic extract.

Chikusetsusaponin IVa

The identification of saponin in its native form was
mostly deduced from a combination of mass spectrometry
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This combi-
nation allowed the identification of an already known sa-
ponin named chikusetsusaponin IVa, previously isolated by
us from leaves of I. dumosa.19 It was obtained as an amor-
phous powder; its main peak in the mass spectrum was m/z
817.4354 Da, corresponding to the chemical species
[(C42H66O14) Na]

+ (expected m/z, 817.4350 Da), together
with the peak m/z 833.4175 Da [(C42H66O14) K]

+ (Fig. 2).
1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (300 MHz, CD3OD)
data were similar to those previously described.19

Effects of chikusetsusaponin IVa on hemostatic system:
in vitro studies

Coagulation assays. The anticoagulant activity of chi-
kusetsusaponin IVa (0–2000 lM) was verified by the de-
termination of the following coagulation parameters in
plasma: recalcification time (RT), activated partial throm-
boplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and throm-
bin time (TT). Anticoagulant experiments were performed
using commercial kits following the manufacturer’s in-
structions (Wiener Lab). Human venous blood was collected
from healthy volunteer donors in 1:10 (vol/vol) 3.8% tri-
sodium citrate and centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min to obtain
plasma. Assays were conducted using a 96-well microplate
SpectraMax as described.22 Results are expressed as the
coagulation time (in seconds) and represent the mean – SEM
values of three independent experiments performed in
quadruplicates.

Amidolytic assay. Saponin (0–2650 lM) was incubated
with thrombin (2 lg/mL) or factor Xa (3.4 lg/mL) in 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 20 min at 37?C. Enzymatic reactions
were started by addition of the chromogenic substrate S2238
(0.2 mM) or S2222 (0.2 mM) in a volume of 100 lL for
the determination of thrombin and factor Xa activities,

respectively. The amount of p-nitroaniline produced was
monitored at 405 nm in intervals of 14 s for 30 min using a
SpectraMax spectrophotometer. The initial rate of hydro-
lysis (expressed as milli-optical density units per minute)
was used to calculate the percentage of thrombin inhibition.
These data were plotted versus the concentration of inhibi-
tor, and a nonlinear regression analysis was performed to
calculate the values for concentration causing 50% inhibi-
tion (IC50) values. For kinetic analysis, saponin (0–450 lM)
was incubated with thrombin prior to the addition of S2238
(50 and 100 lM). Data from the initial rate, expressed as
(lM p-nitroaniline generated/min) - 1, was plotted versus
the inhibitor concentration to construct a Dixon’s plot. The
curves were analyzed by linear regression to calculate the
inhibition constant (Ki) value and to determine the type of
inhibition.23 Results are presented as mean – SEM values
(n = 3).

Thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting. Chikusetsusa-
ponin IVa (0–900 lM) and GL (0–1100 lM) were solubi-
lized in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubated with
thrombin (2 lg/mL) for 10 min at 37?C. Reactions were
initiated by the addition of fibrinogen (2 mg/mL) in a vol-
ume of 100 lL. The kinetics of fibrin formation were mea-
sured at 14-s intervals for 30 min at 650 nm using a
SpectraMax spectrophotometer. The initial rate of clotting
formation (expressed as milli-optical density per minute)
was used to calculate the percentage of the thrombin inhi-
bition. These data were plotted versus the concentration of
inhibitor, and a nonlinear regression analysis was performed
to calculate the IC50 (mean – SEM, n = 3).

Platelet aggregation. The platelet function was mea-
sured by the in vitro photometric method,24 using a Spec-
traMax spectrophotometer. Whole human blood was
collected from healthy volunteer donors. Washed human
platelets were then prepared by gel filtration in a Sepharose
2B column.25 Platelet concentration was adjusted to 350,000
cells/lL in a Neubauer chamber. Platelet aggregation was
measured by the decreased rate in washed human platelet
optical density in a final volume of 150 lL. The agonists
used were as follows: ADP (10 lM), collagen (2.5 lg/mL),
arachidonic acid (10 lM), or human thrombin (3 lg/mL).
Saponin (0–1000 lM) was preincubated with washed human

platelets for 20 min before the addition of agonist. The re-
sults are expressed as the percentage area under curves
(mean – SEM, n = 4).

Effects of chikusetsusaponin IVa saponin on hemostatic
system: In vivo studies

Animals. Male Wistar rats (weighing 300–350 g) were
housed in a temperature-controlled room (21–25?C, in a
12-h light/dark cycle) with free access to water and food. All
procedures involving animals were carried out in accor-
dance with the guiding principles of the International So-
ciety of Toxicology and the Brazilian College of Animal
Experimentation. The experimental protocol was approved
by the Ethical Committee on Research Animal Care of the
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (protocol
number 2008177/2009).

In vivo model of deep venous thrombosis. A rat
thrombosis model that is a combination of stasis and hy-
percoagulability induced by a tissue factor-rich component
was used according to the literature26 with minor modifi-
cations.27 In brief, rats were anesthetized with xylazine
(16 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.). The
abdomen was surgically opened, and the vena cava was
exposed and dissected free from surrounding tissues. Sub-
sequently, rats received the following treatments via the left
femoral vein (final volume of 0.7 mL): (1) saline, n = 4; (2)
chikusetsusaponin IVa at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4 per dose; or
(3) GL at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4 per dose. After 3 min,
calcium thromboplastin (3 mg/kg) was injected into the vena
cava, and stasis was immediately established by the ligation
of caudal vena cava (above the insertion point of the right
renal vein). The distal ligations of the vena cava, left renal
vein, and other major tributaries were conducted 20 min
after thromboplastin administration. The isolated segment
of caudal vena cava was removed, and the thrombus was
separated, rinsed with saline (at 37?C), dried on a filter paper
at 60?C (1 h), and weighed. The ratio value of thrombus/rat
weight was used for data comparison.

Bleeding effect. Rats were anesthetized as described
above, and the following treatments were administered via
the left femoral vein (final volume of 0.7 mL): (1) saline,

n = 4; (2) chikusetsusaponin IVa at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4
per dose; or (3) GL at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4 per dose. After
5 min, the rat’s tail was cut off 3 mm from the tip and
carefully immersed in 40 mL of distilled water at room
temperature. Blood loss was evaluated 60 min later as a
function of hemoglobin concentration in aqueous solution.7

Hemoglobin concentration was determined at 540 nm using
a standard curve made with hemoglobin. The hemoglobin
content in the water of saline-treated animals was used as a
control.

Ex vivo determination of aPTT and hemoglo-
bin. Animals were anesthetized as described above, and
the following treatments were administered via the left
femoral vein (final volume of 0.7 mL): (1) saline, n = 4; (2)
chikusetsusaponin IVa at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4 per dose; or
(3) GL at 15 and 50 mg/kg, n = 4 per dose. Blood samples
were collected from the right femoral vein (0.3 mL in 3.8%
trisodium citrate, 1:10 [vol/vol]) at different times post-
treatment. Each blood sample was centrifuged, and plasma
was used to measure the aPTT as described above. To es-
timate the hemolytic potential of saponins, hemoglobin
content was measured in plasma samples of animals treated
with 50 mg/kg chikusetsusaponin IVa or GL. The concen-
tration of free plasma hemoglobin was measured with a kit
commercially available following the manufacturer’s in-
structions (Labtest SA, Lagoa Santa, MG, Brazil).

Statistical analysis

Results are expressed as mean – SEM values, and sig-
nificance was determined by Student’s t test. When more
than two groups were compared, an analysis of variance was
used followed by a Bonferroni’s test to compare pairs of
means. The data were considered significant with a proba-
bility of &amp;lt;.05.

RESULTS

Effects of chikusetsusaponin IVa on hemostatic system:
in vitro studies

Chikusetsusaponin IVa showed anticoagulation effects by
elongating the time for RT, aPTT, PT, and TT in a dose-
dependent manner (Table 1). At 500 lM, a significant in-
hibition was observed in PT and TT. At 1000 lM, the sa-
ponin caused an increase of 1.3-fold in RT, 2.3-fold in
aPTT, 1.8-fold in PT, and 1.9-fold in TT compared with
respective control values (Table 1). In relation to the hy-
drolysis of synthetic substrates, chikusetsusaponin IVa in-
hibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the enzymes tested
(S2238 and S2222) with IC50 values of 384.2 – 44.2 lM for
thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis (Fig. 3A) and 1585.7 –
96.9 lM for factor Xa-catalyzed hydrolysis (Fig. 3B). En-
zyme kinetic studies indicated that chikusetsusaponin IVa
inhibited the thrombin catalytic hydrolysis of S2238 in
a competitive manner with a Ki value of 219.6 – 32 lM
(Fig. 3C).

As shown in Figure 4, chikusetsusaponin IVa inhibited
the thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting in a dose-dependent
manner with an IC50 value of 199.4 – 9.1 lM. This inhibitory
activity was similar to that obtained for GL (235.7 – 1.4 lM;
Fig. 4). In relation to the platelet aggregation, the saponin
had no effect on ADP or on arachidonic acid-induced
aggregation (Fig. 5). However, it significantly inhibited
collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in a
dose-dependent manner. The calculated IC50 values for
collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation were
482 and 190 lM, respectively.

Effects of chikusetsusaponin IVa on hemostatic system:
in vivo studies

As shown in Figure 6A, chikusetsusaponin IVa reduced
the size of the thrombus by 56.2% and 91.2% at doses of
15 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. In comparison, GL was able
to reduce the thrombus only 21.2% and 53.1% at doses of
15 and 50 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 6A). In addition, chi-
kusetsusaponin IVa did not induce a significant bleeding
effect after intravascular administration (Fig. 6B). How-
ever, GL caused an increase in blood loss of approximately
1.8-fold compared with the control at the dose of 50 mg/kg
(Fig. 6B).

The anticoagulant effect of chikusetsusaponin IVa ob-
served in vitro was confirmed by the measurement of aPTT
ex vivo. Compared with the control, chikusetsusaponin IVa
at 50 mg/kg was responsible for a significant prolongation of
aPTT at different times following intravascular adminis-
tration (Table 2). A similar result was observed after the
injection of GL at 50 mg/kg (Table 2). To verify the he-
molytic potential of chikusetsusaponin IVa and GL, we
measured the hemoglobin content in the plasma of animals
previously treated with saponins. No signs of hemoly-
sis were observed in the plasma of animals treated with
50 mg/kg GL (control, 43.21 – 8.2 mg/dL; treated, 43.35 –
4.5 mg/dL) or chikusetsusaponin IVa (control, 42.11 –
5.6 mg/dL; treated, 40.75 – 4.7 mg/dL).

DISCUSSION

Herein, the anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and in vivo an-
tithrombotic activities of chikusetsusaponin IVa were de-
scribed for the first time. When tested in vitro,
chikusetsusaponin IVa caused a dose-dependent prolonga-
tion of RT, aPTT, and PT, suggesting that the major targets
for this compound were factors Xa, Va, and thrombin. Ad-
ditionally, chikusetsusaponin IVa was able to inhibit the TT,
indicating thrombin as a potential target for this saponin in
plasma. A dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin- and fac-
tor Xa-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific synthetic substrates
(S2238 and S2222, respectively) was observed after incu-
bation with chikusetsusaponin IVa. This observation con-
firms that the main targets of this saponin are common
coagulation factors. Moreover, the IC50 value for factor Xa
inhibition was four times higher than that for thrombin in-
hibition, indicating a preference for thrombin over factor
Xa. We demonstrated that chikusetsusaponin IVa is a
competitive inhibitor of thrombin, similar to other thrombin

inhibitors such as the thrombin receptor peptide or glyco-
protein GPIb that are known to act in the micromolar
range.28,29

Chikusetsusaponin IVa also inhibited thrombin-induced
fibrinogen clotting activity with an IC50 that was two times

lower than that for the thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of
S2238. These values indicate that chikusetsusaponin IVa
most likely interacts with sites in the thrombin molecule
other than the catalytic site because a more potent inhibi-
tion was observed when the macromolecular substrate fi-
brinogen was used. Chikusetsusaponin IVa has an in vitro
antiplatelet effect when induced by thrombin and collagen
as well as an in vivo antithrombotic property. In compari-
son with GL, chikusetsusaponin IVa had a significantly
more potent antithrombotic effect at the doses of 15 and
50 mg/kg. In addition, chikusetsusaponin IVa had no
bleeding effect, which may be considered an advantage
compared with known antithrombotic agents such as hir-
udin, argatroban, heparin, or acetylsalicylic acid.30 Fur-

or GL had no toxic hemolytic effect in treated animals and
caused only a slight increase in ex vivo aPTT. Moreover,
this saponin had a significant antithrombotic activity at a
dose of 15 mg/kg without affecting the aPTT. Recently, it
was reported that potent orally active factor Xa inhibitors
such as darexaban and darexaban glucuronide are able to
inhibit thrombus formation and prolong the coagulation
time in vivo without inducing any bleeding effect.31 It was
reported15 that chikusetsusaponins III, IV, and V increased
the in vitro activity of urokinase, an important plasminogen
activator during fibrinolysis. Possibly, the increase in fi-
brinolysis induced by chikusetsusaponins contributed to
the antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects described in
this research.

In conclusion, chikusetsusaponin IVa is a new plant-
derived antithrombotic compound that increases the coag-
ulation time and promotes antiplatelet and antithrombotic
activity.

Glycyrrhizin, a saponin, and its aglycone glycyrrhetinic
acid are natural products found in the Liquorice (Gly-
cyrrhiza glabra L.) root extract. This saponin is known
for its in vitro and in vivo thrombin inhibitory activity.
The design and synthesis of five glycyrrhizin deriva-
tives were carried out to improve the natural product
activity. Compound 3b, a phthalic ester derivative of
glycyrrhizin, presented a more pronounced thrombin
inhibition (IC50 = 114.4 ? 1.3 lM) than the saponin
(IC50 = 235.7 ? 1.4 lM). Molecular docking simulations
performed to investigate the molecular interaction
between compound 3b and the enzyme indicate that
this product is, as previously determined for glycyrrhi-
zin, an allosteric thrombin inhibitor.

Pathologies associated with hypercoagulable states,
including myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism, are one of the most important
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1). In spite of
the arise of several new synthetic agents in the recent
years for treating such diseases, mainly direct thrombin
and fXa inhibitors, concerns still exist for side-effects, spe-
cially bleeding (2,3).

In the recent years, the saponin glycyrrhizin (1) was found
to be an in vitro and in vivo thrombin inhibitor, being the
first plant-derived natural product with this activity reported
in the literature (4,5). Additionally, the in vitro assays indi-
cate that its observed thrombin inhibitory effect is due
to the selective inhibition of the enzyme’s anion-binding
exosite 1 (3).

Glycyrrhizin (1) and its aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid (2) are
natural products that are abundant in the Liquorice (Glyc-
yrrhiza glabra L.) root extract. This saponin is used world-
wide as a natural sweetener and employed in many
Chinese, Indian and Tibetan traditional preparations. Both
compounds are known in the literature for its wide range
of biological activities, and they have been employed as
scaffolds for the semisynthesis of several derivatives with
interesting pharmacological proprieties (6,7). ‘Stronger
Neo-Minophagen C’, a glycyrrhizin-containing i.v. formula-
tion, has been used for more than 30 years in Japan for
the treatment of chronic hepatitis diseases (8), being also
marketed in China, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, India and
Mongolia (9).

While synthetic derivatives of heparin analogues as fonda-
parinux are already in therapeutic use (1), such compounds
are difficult and expensive to obtain, which has supported
the simplification of the carbohydrate scaffold by other,
non-saccharidic structures (10). In this context, the current
work is focused on the structural simplification of the car-
bohydrate moiety of 1, searching for potential new non-
saccharidic scaffolds with improved antithrombotic activity.

Methods and Materials

Assuming that the carboxylic acid groups present at the
carbohydrate units of 1 were crucial to the interaction with

the enzyme’s basic exosite, we devised a simple and
straightforward molecular simplification via the synthesis of
hemi-esters employing the triterpene 2 as starting material
(Scheme 1) and cyclic and acyclic anhydrides, leading to
the esters 3a (also known as carbenoxolone), 3b and the
3-O-acetyl derivative 3c (6,7). We also employed the clas-
sical Jones oxidation protocol (6,7) to obtain the ketone
derivative (4). The reaction of 4 with hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride gave its respective oxime 5 in moderate-to-good
yields (Scheme 1). Chemical purity and properties of all
synthesized compounds (melting point, TLC profiles when
available and 1H- and 13C-NMR) were compared with pre-
vious reports in the literature [3a and 3b (10), 3c (11), 4
(12) and 5 (13)].

Results and Discussion

Because no previous structure–activity relationship was
available to guide compound 1 structural modifications,
our first step was to evaluate the importance of the

carbohydrate moiety on thrombin modulation. Accordingly,
the saponin 1 and its aglycone 2 were tested in the thrombin-
induced fibrinogen clotting assay. While 1 presented an
IC50 = 235.7 ? 1.4 lM, compound 2 was found to be
inactive on thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting assay
(Figure 1), pointing to the importance of the carbohydrate
moiety interactions with thrombin.

As previous works from our group described the binding
of 1 to thrombin exosite 1, known for its basic properties,
the carbohydrate moiety was substituted by acidic, hydro-
gen-bonding acceptor groups (Scheme 1) to evaluate (i)
the influence of the substituent configurational entropy and
flexibility (3a and 3b), (ii) the role of the chemical function
nature at C-3 upon removal of the carbohydrate residues
(4 and 5) and (iii) the importance of the ester group at C-3
(3a–c).

Compounds 4 and 5 presented IC50 values &gt;1000 lM in the
thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting assay, pointing to an
absence of influence of the hydrogen bond characteristics

of the group at C-3, that is, donor or acceptor. Similar
results were obtained for 3c, indicating that the ester
group at C-3 has minor or no participation on interactions
with thrombin, being unable to recover the interactions lost
from glycan removal.

Compounds 3a and 3b, however, indicate that such carbo-
hydrate moiety is not an absolute requirement for thrombin
binding and inhibition, with the phthalic ester 3b showing an
almost twofold increase in its activity (IC50 = 114.4
? 1.3 lM) accompanied with a significant simplification of
the molecule structure (Figure 1A,B). In fact, substitution of
carbohydrates by aromatic rings has been described previ-
ously regarding antithrombin activation by heparin mimetics,
based on sulphated flavonoids (14). In spite of a great
reduction in the number of hydrogen bond-capable groups
from 1 to 3b, there is also a great reduction in configura-
tional entropy lost upon complexation, which may explain
such increase in activity. This possibility correlates with the
low activity of compound 3a (IC50 = 398.6 ? 6.9 lM) in
comparison with 3b (Figure 1B). Also, compound 3b
showed a more pronounced anticoagulant activity when
tested in human plasma. In fact, compound 3b caused a
significant prolongation of thrombin time compared with
normal plasma values (Table 1).

With the purpose of obtaining further insights into the
reported activities, compounds 1, 2, 3a and 3b were
docked on thrombin exosite I, previously observed as
the binding site for glycyrrhizin (4). Additionally, as the
inhibitory effect upon thrombin is expected to modulate
the conformation of its catalytic site, each docking com-

plex was further refined through molecular docking (MD)
simulations to search for potential allosteric influences of the
compounds, in comparison with non-inhibited thrombin, as
reported for the modulation of thrombin by sulphated
arabinans (15). A simulation of uncomplexed thrombin was
employed as a negative control, and in addition to the use of
glycyrrhizin as the positive control, another anticoagulant
saponin, through thrombin inhibition, chikusetsusaponin IVa
(b-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid, (3b)-28-(b-D-glucopyrano-
syloxy)-28-oxoolean-12-en-3-yl) (6) (16) was also simulated
in complex to its target protein. The so-obtained data from
the combination of docking and MD are presented in
Figure 1 and Table 2.

Improving the Thrombin Inhibitory Activity

The MD simulations indicated a progressive reorientation
of the docking-derived conformations, further exploring the
exosite surface and refining the interactions with the pro-
tein along the simulations (Figure 1). Regarding com-
pounds 1 and 3b, the dynamics of these products indicate
that the anionic exosite 1 is properly occupied, and there
are similarities between the binding regions of both mole-
cules. The less active compounds 2 and 3a appear to
populate the site in a more diffuse manner on the simula-
tions, moving either to the northwest region of the site (2)
or to the southern region (3a). The binding of 1 and 3b to
the anionic exosite 1 is important for inhibition because this
site is essential for fibrinogen recognition by thrombin.
Thus, MD simulations corroborate our previous results,
which showed the ability of compound 1 to displace hiru-
din (a specific ligand of thrombin exosite 1) from its binding
site (4).

Additionally, MD simulations also indicated that the com-
pounds could modulate the conformation of thrombin cat-
alytic site. As showed in Table 2, the distance between
catalytic triad residues had an increase after binding of
compounds 3b and 6 in comparison with uncomplexed
thrombin. Interestingly, these compounds also had the
lowest IC50 values in the thrombin-induced fibrinogen clot-
ting assay and the most potent anticoagulant activity in
plasma. Our hypothesis is that the binding to exosite 1
could induce these changes in catalytic triad residues via
allosteric modulation and thus contribute to the inhibitory
activity. In fact, we recently showed that compound 6 is
also able to inhibit the thrombin-induced hydrolysis of
chromogenic substrate S2238 (H-D-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitro-
anilide), a synthetic peptide designed specifically to the
thrombin catalytic site (16). Unlike fibrinogen, the cleavage
of synthetic peptide is not dependent on interaction with
exosite 1, indicating that compound 6 can modulate the
active site. Similar to compound 6, compound 3b was
also able to inhibit hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide,
while 1 was not (Figure 1C).

Based on the final frame of thrombin-3b complex, the
main interactions are depicted in Figure 2. The carboxyl
group at the aromatic ring contributes to the majority of
the interactions, through hydrogen bonding with Ala113
backbone and Lys110 side chain. Furthermore, the phenyl
ring participates in hydrophobic interactions involving
mostly Lys81, Ile82, Lys109 and Ser83 (Figure 2). These
findings suggest that the dual nature of the substituent,
comprehending polar and apolar groups, provides multiple
possibilities for the compound binding to the anionic exo-
site 1 and, most important, future insights for further com-
pound optimizations.

Conclusions

Although the synthesized compounds are already known in
the literature, this is the first report regarding the synthesis
of thrombin inhibitory glycyrrhizin (1) derivatives. Compound
3b, with a simpler molecular scaffold than 1, presented a
greater thrombin inhibitory activity and prolonged thrombin
time and, unlike 1, was able to inhibit hydrolysis of the
synthetic peptide S2238, indicating that this ester can
modulate the active site. These results, along with the
docking and MD simulations performed, can be used for
the design and synthesis of new glycyrrhizin derivatives
towards new thrombin inhibitory compounds.
