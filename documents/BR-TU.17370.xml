Abstract: Aim: The aim of this work was to study the relationships between temporal 
variability of Erodona mactroides and abiotic parameters of the water column and the 
substrate in a shallow embayment of the Patos Lagoon estuarine region in southern Brazil; 
Methods: Samples were taken with a PVC corer (10 cm diameter) buried 10 cm into the 
sediment between October 2002 and December 2004. Each month 18 biologic samples 
were taken, six substrate samples were analyzed for sediment grain size and organic matter 
content and sediment deposition rates were determined by 12 sediment traps every two 
weeks. Salinity, water temperature, water level and estuarine freshwater discharge were 
measured daily. Abiotic parameters and bivalve densities were tested among months with 
registered mortality events by ANOVA (One-way, p = 0.05), being the E.  mactroides 
seasonal variability tested by Kruskal-Wallis (p = 0.05). Regression analyses among abiotic 
parameters and Spearman’s “R” correlation analyses between biological and environmental 
data were both performed; Results: Two periods were identified with distinct features: 
one at the beginning of the study when observed limnetic conditions in the estuarine 
region were caused by the ENSO - El Niño 2002/2003 phenomenon when an absence 
of E. mactroides was registered as well as a higher percentages of fine sediments and lower 
percentages of organic matter. The second period was characterized by a decreasing 
influence of the El Niño and predominance of mixohaline conditions, recruitments and 
increasing densities of E. mactroides with a successive decrease of mean densities due to 
three mortality events, lower percentages of fine sediments and higher percentages of 
organic matter; Conclusions: The present study provides evidences that the occurrence 
of E. mactroides in the southern estuarine region depends on the water flow regime from 
the drainage basin, which characterizes species recruitment as temporally unpredictable 
and affects its persistence through time due to adverse conditions that influence species 
development like events of fine sediment deposition.

Keywords: Erodona mactroides, recruitment, El Niño, estuary, Patos Lagoon.

Resumo: Objetivo: O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar as relações entre a 
variabilidade temporal de Erodona mactroides e os parâmetros abióticos da coluna d’água 
e do substrato em uma enseada rasa da região estuarina da Lagoa dos Patos, sul do Brasil; 
Métodos: As amostras foram coletadas com um extrator de PVC (10 cm de diâmetro), 
enterrado a 10 cm no interior do sedimento, entre Outubro/02 e Dezembro/04. Em 
cada mês foram coletadas 18 amostras biológicas, seis réplicas de sedimento para análises 
granulométricas e teor de matéria orgânica, além de 12 réplicas quinzenais de experimentos 
de deposição de sedimentos. A salinidade, temperatura da coluna d’água, profundidade e 
vazão do estuário foram medidas diariamente. Os parâmetros abióticos e densidades do 
bivalve entre os meses em que foram observados eventos de mortalidade foram testados 
através de ANOVA (Uma via, p = 0,05), e a variabilidade sazonal de E. mactroides foi 
testada através da análise de Kruskal-Wallis (p = 0,05). Foi aplicada análise de Regressão 
entre os dados abióticos e Correlação de Spearman “R” entre os dados biológicos de 
densidade e parâmetros ambientais; Resultados: Foram identificados dois períodos com 
características distintas: no início do estudo foram registradas condições limnéticas na 
região estuarina devido ao fenômeno ENSO – El Niño 2002/2003, quando foi registrada 
a ausência de E. mactroides, maiores percentuais de sedimento finos e menores percentuais 
de matéria orgânica. O segundo período foi caracterizado pela diminuição da influência

was previously analyzed by Bemvenuti and 
Netto (1998), observing the wide distribution 
of E. mactroides along the entire lagoon and the 
estuarine region. This bivalve inhabits large areas 
at the Patos Lagoon upper portion, where all 
size classes are found and high densities of adults 
occur, while southwards in the estuarine region 
only juveniles were observed (Bemvenuti  et  al., 
1978; Capítoli  et  al., 1978). Recently, temporal 
variability analysis of macrozoobenthos in Patos 
Lagoon estuary showed that high densities of the 
bivalve occur associated with limnetic conditions 
(Colling et al., 2007).

The larvae of E. mactroides of the adult 
reproductive stock in the upper estuary which are 
carried by ebb tides to the south during spring and 
summer, give origin the observed recruitments 
in sheltered embayments in southern estuarine 
regions. At these sites, juvenile massive mortalities 
were observed on later autumn, suggesting that the 
obstruction of their filtration system apparatus may 
be the cause of death due to deposition of suspended 
matter (Bemvenuti, 1997b).

Concerning the general size, the bivalve 
lengths range between 0.42-43.22 mm in Laguna 
Rocha - Uruguay (Jorcin, 1996) and between 
1.00-35.00  mm in the Patos Lagoon, where 
individuals smaller than 20 mm were considered 
juveniles (Geraldi, 2002). Inside the Pando Stream, 
Uruguay, Passadore et al. (2007) reported organisms 
smaller than 14 mm as recruits.

Considering that larval input from the upper 
estuary to the southern region depends on the 
temporal variability of the systems water discharge, 
the present work aimed to evaluate if recruitment 
of E. mactroides at the lower estuary during spring/
summer may be influenced by stochastic events 
like the El Niño phenomena. Besides the water 
column characterization, recruitment periods and 
bivalve densities, this work also aimed to investigate 
the temporal variability of E. mactroides densities 

1. Introduction

The mollusc Erodona mactroides Bosc, 1802 is 
one of the most abundant bivalves found at the 
mixohaline regions of rivers, lagoons and estuaries 
in southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina (Costa, 
1971; Jorcin, 1996), occurring at Rio de la Plata 
affluent rivers near Buenos Aires (Carcelles, 1941) 
and also at Laguna Rocha, as well as streams and 
rivers along the Uruguayan coast (Jorcin, 1996; 
Muniz and Venturini, 2001). Along the coast of 
the State of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil, 
the species is found at high densities in the Patos 
Lagoon estuary (Rosa-Filho and Bemvenuti, 1998; 
Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), where is a common 
macrobenthic species (Rosa and Bemvenuti, 2007; 
Colling et al., 2007).

This Erodonidae species is inequivalve with the 
right valve large and convex, displaying subtrigonal 
shells with anterior side rounded and posterior 
rostrate (Rios, 2009). As a subsurface inhabitant and 
suspension feeder, this species plays an important 
ecological role in the Patos Lagoon due to the 
exposure of its shell in the bottom surface, which can 
be considered the unique biological hard substrate 
for macrobenthic communities on soft bottoms, 
allowing the attachment of epibionthic organisms 
(Bemvenuti  et  al., 1978). As a consequence of 
its high abundance and wide distribution in the 
Patos Lagoon, E. mactroides is considered the main 
phytoplankton consumer among macrobenthic 
invertebrates (Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), being 
responsible for an important energy flux from the 
water column to the benthic environment, in which 
the species is reported as an important food item 
for major decapod and fish species (Araújo, 1984; 
Bemvenuti, 1997a).

The first records of E. mactroides in the Patos 
Lagoon were reported by von Ihering (1885), 
while another study, concerning the distribution of 
Thecamoeba and Foraminifera species, mentions the 
presence of this species in the southern portion of 
the lagoon (Closs, 1962). The spatial distribution 
of the macrobenthic fauna in the Patos Lagoon 

do El Niño e predominância de condições mixohalinas, recrutamentos e pelo aumento 
das densidades médias de E. mactroides com sucessivos decréscimos no número de 
organismos devido a três eventos de mortalidade, menores percentuais de sedimentos finos 
e maiores percentuais de matéria orgânica; Conclusões: O presente estudo evidencia que 
a ocorrência de E. mactroides na porção sul da região estuarina, que depende do regime de 
vazão da laguna, caracteriza os recrutamentos como temporalmente imprevisíveis, e sua 
persistência é afetada por condições desfavoráveis a seu desenvolvimento como eventos 
de deposição de sedimentos finos.

from the sediment under stereomicroscope and then 
preserved in a 70% ethanol solution.

Attaching a milimetric scale (0.5 mm of 
precision) to Petry plates, measures of the right 
valve’s anteroposterior length were taken from 
18,391 individuals in order to evaluate the 
frequency distribution of E. mactroides size classes 
as well as the species temporal development.

The months used to define the seasons of the 
present work were as follows: spring (from October 
to December), summer (January to March), autumn 
(April to June) and winter (July to September). 
Salinity, freshwater discharge (m3/s), water level 
(cm), silt + clay (%) and OM contents (%) were 
transformed to log (x+1) and tested by ANOVA 
(One-way; p = 0.05) to investigate their temporal 
differences among seasons. The temporal variability 
of E. mactroides densities was tested by Kruskal-
Wallis non-parametric analyses (p = 0.05), since 
normality and homogeneity of these data were not 
attained, even after several transformations.

Regression analyses were pairwisely executed 
to the monthly means of silt + clay percentages, 
OM contents, fluvial discharge, salinity and water 
level, being used for each pair of data the best R2 
mathematical equation. In order to determine 
possible significant correlations between biological 
and environmental data (Zar, 1984) the Spearman’s 
“R” correlation coefficient (p = 0.05) were used 
to compare the monthly means of E. mactroides 
densities to the following standardized abiotic data 
(Clarke and Warwick, 1994): silt + clay percentages, 
OM contents, fluvial discharge, salinity and water 
level.

To evaluate the significance of declining in 
the E. mactroides densities there were performed 
ANOVA tests (One-way; p = 0.05) on each pair 
of the following months: August-September 2003, 
April-May 2004 and October-November 2004, all 
considered here as mortality events due to expressive 
reductions in the bivalve densities.

To quantify the depositional processes that are 
able to interfere in the survival and persistence 
of E.  mactroides through time, experiments on 
sediment deposition were fortnightly executed 
utilizing 12 particle interceptor traps. These 
sediment traps were built using an external PVC 
pipe (7.5 cm diameter × 15 cm high) with 10 PVC 
tubes inside of it (1 cm diameter × 10 cm high) 
fixed on a solid base buried into the substrate. These 
traps were placed on the sampling site 15 days 
before the biological sampling and then removed 
to the laboratory, where the caught sediments were 

and evaluate possible mortality events related to 
substrate dynamics like fine sediment depositions.

2. Material and Methods

Located at the coastal plain of southern Brazil, 
the Patos Lagoon is classified as the world’s largest 
choked lagoon (Kjerfve, 1986). With a surface 
area of 10,227 km2, this coastal lagoon stretches 
in a NE-SW direction from 30º 30’ S to 32º 12’ 
S near the city of Rio Grande. Inside its southern 
portion an estuarine region of 971 km² is found 
(approximately 10% of the lagoon) which exchanges 
waters with the Atlantic Ocean through a 20 km 
long and 0.5-3 km wide inlet. Through tributary 
rivers and the São Gonçalo channel (Lagoa 
Mirim watershed), this lagoon receives freshwater 
from a 201,626 km² drainage basin, in which 
high precipitation and complex patterns of river 
discharge result in highly dynamic hydrographic 
processes (Asmus, 1997).

The present study was performed along a 450 m 
transect of a sheltered shallow plain in the Saco do 
Arraial embayment (see map in Colling et al., 2007).

Samples were taken monthly from October 
2002 to December 2004 in an area with 0.8 m mean 
depth. At each month, sediment samples (n = 6) were 
taken using a PVC corer (10 cm diameter) buried 10 
cm into the bottom to analyse granulometric and 
organic matter content (OM). Sand, silt and clay 
proportions were determined according to Suguio 
(1973) through sieving (particles &gt; 0.062 mm) and 
pipette analyses (particles &amp;lt;0.062 mm) while OM 
contents were determined through weight loss by 
combustion according Davies (1974).

Daily water temperature (ºC), salinity and 
water level (cm) were provided by the Brazilian 
Long-Term Ecological Program databank (PELD 
– Programas Ecológicos de Longa Duração – Site 8 – 
FURG; www.peld.furg.br). Fluvial discharge data 
from the Patos Lagoon main tributary rivers Jacuí, 
Taquari and Camaquã (Vaz et al., 2006) were taken 
daily from the Brazilian Waters Agency (ANA – 
Agência Nacional de Águas; www.ana.gov.br), being 
used here to represent the Patos Lagoon drainage 
basin monthly runoff mean (sum of Jacuí, Taquari 
and Camaquã river discharges).

Biologic samples were taken monthly (n = 18) 
using the same PVC corer used in the sediment 
samples, being sieved in the field through a 
nylon sieve with 0.3 mm mesh size and then 
fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution. In the 
laboratory, E.  mactroides individuals were sorted

were registered during the winter/02 (previously to 
the sampling period), along spring/02 and on early 
summer/03, with fortnightly means not higher than 
five, except on September 2002. Increasing salinities 
were observed from later summer/03 (fortnightly 
means between 5 and 15) to early summer/04, 
when low salinity values were registered, followed 
again by an increase in salinity from summer/04 to 
winter/04, period when were registered fortnightly 
means often higher than 15.

It was calculated for the Patos Lagoon estuarine 
region a decadal mean of water level (MWL) 
comprising the daily values registered in the PELD 
databank between January 1994 and December 
2004, from which it was calculated a MWL equal 
to 48.7 cm. For the spring/02 and summer/03, the 
mean water level registered were 70.0 cm, a value 
higher than that decadal mean due to the great 
freshwater discharge (Figure 1c). On the other 
hand, from the spring/03 to spring/04 there were 
registered water levels between 30 and 50 cm, values 
significant lower than those observed in the early 
sampling period (Table 1).

Percentages of fine sediments (silt + clay) as 
well as the percentages of organic matter in the 
sediment varied significantly among the analyzed 
periods (Table 1). Higher percentages of silt and clay 

weighted (total weigh expressed in g) and their 
granulometric fractions were determined. These 
experiments were executed between December 2002 
and August 2004, except for January, March, June 
and October 2003 and July 2004.

3. Results

Higher water temperatures were registered 
during summer/03 (25.8 °C) and summer/04 
(24.8 °C) while lower ones were observed during 
winter/03 (13.6 °C) and winter/04 (13.1 °C). The 
water temperature along spring seasons were always 
warmer than those registered in autumn seasons.

Significant differences in the mean freshwater 
discharge were found among the evaluated periods 
(Table 1; Figure 1a). From spring/02 to summer/03 
there were registered the highest values of discharge, 
as observed on October 2002 (5,982 m3/s). After 
these elevated runoff rates in the begging of the 
study, it was observed significant decreasing 
discharges with the lowest rates being registered 
from summer/04 to autumn/04, like those on 
March 2004 (about 307 m3/s).

Salinity data showed significant differences 
among seasons (Table 1) and great temporal 
variability (Figure 1b), ranging from zero (spring/02 
and summer/03) to 35 (autumn/04). Lower values

(R2  =  0.72) and salinity × discharge (R2  =  0.50). 
The abiotic pair wised regression between 
discharge × water level (R2 = 0.83) presented the best 
linear relation throughout the study since periods of 
elevated runoff are linked to elevations on the water 
level of the lagoon. These periods of high water level 
were found to be strongly related to OM contents 
(R2 = 0.64), despite the temporal irregularity 
of this later variable (Figure 2), and also to 
elevated proportions of fine sediments (R2 = 0.54). 
In addition, there were found weak temporal 
relationships between the following pairwised data: 
discharge x fine sediments (R2  =  0.40), salinity × 
OM (R2 = 0.36) and discharge × OM (R2 = 0.30).

were registered in spring/02 (21.00%  ±  9.90%), 
summer/03 (9.80% ± 3.63%) and autumn/03 
(7.35% ± 5.05%), when a reduction of fine 
sediments was observed from the winter/03 to 
autumn/04 (4.26% ± 1.60%; Figure 2). Higher 
percentages of organic matter (Table 1) were found 
from autumn/03 (1.15% ± 1.44%) to autumn/04 
(1.22% ± 0.27%), while lower values were registered 
in spring/02 (0.29% ± 0.06%) and summer/03 
(0.26% ± 1.12%) - the first two sampling periods 
- besides the winter/04 (0.74% ± 0.19%).

Pairwised regressions on environmental data 
(Figure 3) evidenced strong relationships between 
OM × fine sediments (R2 = 0.76), salinity ×  fine 
sediments (R2 = 0.59), salinity  ×  water level

frequency of lengths were registered between 6 and 
9 mm with the biggest individuals reaching 18 mm.

There were found weak temporal relationships 
between the E. mactroides densities and fine 
sediments (R2 = 0.41), OM contents (R2 = 0.25) and 
discharge (R2 = 0.30). On the other hand, strong 
temporal relations were found between E. mactroides 
densities × water level (R2 = 0.56) and E. mactroides 
densities x salinity (R2 = 0.70), mainly due to the 
absence of the species during the early sampling 
period associated to high water level and low salinity 
values, respectively (Figure 6).

The Spearman’s correlation coefficients evidenced 
no significant correlations between the E. mactroides 
densities and all the environmental data except for 
fine sediments, being found a negative temporal 
correlation (p = 0.037; R = -0.402) (Table 2).

The observed reductions in the E. mactroides 
mean densities were found significant for all the 
following months (Figure 7; Table 1): August-
September 2003 (from 13,651 to 8,004 ind.m-2); 
April-May 2004 (from 6,433 to 2,101 ind.m-2); 
and October-November 2004 (from 2,852 to 
997 ind.m-2).

In the first mortality event (August-September 
2003) it was registered an increasing of fine sediments 

The absence of E. mactroides in the spring/02 
as well as its low densities in summer/03 were 
responsible to characterize the mean densities of the 
bivalve along this early periods as significantly lower 
(p &amp;lt;0.05) than those registered in the subsequent 
seasons (Table 1). The first occurrence of E. mactroides 
was registered on later summer - autumn/03 
(Figure  4), with higher densities occurring 
along this last season (11,628  ±  6,428  ind.m-2), 
winter/03 (10,406 ± 6,640 ind.m-2) and spring/03 
(8,485  ±  4,280 ind.m-2). Successive density 
reductions were observed from summer to spring/04 
(1,519 ± 1,163 ind.m-2), being these reduced 
densities significantly lower than those registered 
for both autumn and winter/03 (p &amp;lt;0.05).

Those bivalves collected in summer/03 and 
autumn/03 were classified in the size classes 
between 0.5-3 mm (Figure 5a,b), representing post 
settled recruits with non calcified shells. Size classes 
smaller than 1 mm were found until the winter/03, 
when recruits were not registered anymore. 
Between winter/03 and spring/03 the occurrence 
of organisms &amp;lt;3 mm decreased, period in which 
individuals of different size classes characterized 
the development of those recruits (Figure 5c,d).

from autumn - winter/03; and its gradual reductions 
due to three mortality events that lead to its absence 
in later spring/04.

The environmental variables characterized 
two periods with distinct features: one in the 
beginning of the study when there were registered 
limnetic conditions in the estuarine region 
caused by the ENSO - El Niño 2002/2003 
phenomenon, in which there were observed 
higher percentages of fine sediments and lower 
percentages of organic matter. The second period 
was characterized by a decreasing influence of the 
El Niño phenomenon, predominance of mixohaline 
waters, lower percentages of fine sediments and 
higher percentages of organic matter.

The Patos Lagoon presents low tidal amplitude 
and salinity variations strongly influenced by the 
action of winds (seasonal scale) and hydrological 
cycles on its drainage basin (interannual scale), in 
which the predominance of freshwaters inside the 
estuarine region are associated to NE winds and 
elevated fluvial discharge; on the other hand, the 
predominance of marine waters inside the estuary 
are found to be related to S winds and droughts on 

for the substrate an increase on its fine sediment 
rates (Figure 2), ranging from 1.98% on August to 
4.75% on September 2003.

In the second mortality event (April-May 2004) 
the weight of deposited silt + clay fractions raised 
from 40.54 g on April to 59.08 g on May, with 
fine sediment percentages increasing from 39.37 to 
67.39% (Figure 8). Sedimentation rates in these 
months also raised from 9,213 g.m-2 15 days-1 to 
13,427 g.m-2 15 days-1 respectively (Table 3), despite 
the similar values found for the substrate between 
April (3.97%) and May (3.49%; Figure 2).

During the third mortality event (October-
November 2004) the experiments on deposition 
were not carried out, but the substrate granulometry 
revealed that the fine sediments percentage increased 
from October (3.83%) to November (6.53%; 
Figure 2).

4. Discussion

Our results evidenced that the bivalve 
E. mactroides had a significant temporal variability 
along the study: its absence in the early sampling 
period (spring/02); its occurrence in high densities

Patos Lagoon hydrodynamics during the 1998’s 
El Niño (Fernandes  et  al., 2002), it was verified 
a great discharge increment and a raise of water 
level southwards the lagoon. Likewise, the period 
between later autumn/02 and later summer/03 was 
again influenced by this phenomenon (NOAA, 
2006), with consequent maintenance of freshwater 
inside the estuarine region until the end of 
summer/03, as well as a mean water level higher 
than the decadal mean (Capítoli et al., 2008).

High rates of pluviometric precipitation in the 
Patos Lagoon are responsible for a considerable 
transport of silt and clay towards the estuarine 

the drainage basin of this lagoon (Niencheski and 
Baumgarten, 1997).

The El Niño phenomenon can be considered as 
the main source of great pluviometric events at the 
South America (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; 
Grimm  et  al., 2000), increasing the precipitation 
rates in southern Brazil during the spring seasons and 
intensifying rains from May to July. As a consequence 
to the hydrographic regime inside the Patos Lagoon, 
the continental discharge rather exceeds its mean 
values (Garcia, 1997) and the water level presents 
a pronounced positive anomaly (Costa et al., 2003; 
Colling et al., 2007). In a previous study about the

the relationship between this two environmental 
variables.

The maintenance of limnetic conditions inside 
the estuarine region on summer can influence 
significantly the behavior of estuarine species, 
since in periods non influenced by the ENSO 
phenomenon it is expected to occur the inflow of 
marine water into the estuary due to low fluvial 
discharge (Costa  et  al., 1988). Changes in the 
ictiofaunal structure were found inside the Patos 
Lagoon southern portion as a consequence of the 
lower salinity caused by the ENSO phenomenon, 
being registered species from limnetic regions and 
reductions on marine and estuarine species’ richness 
(Garcia et al., 2001).

Late recruitments in the macrobenthic fauna, 
which occurred only on later summer/03 and 
early autumn/03 in the Patos Lagoon estuary, 
evidenced that environmental changes like those 
on salinity, hydrodynamics and in the bottom 
sediments are able to influence the variability of 

region, which come from many sources within the 
extensive Patos-Mirim drainage basin (Calliari, 
1997). In the present work, higher percentages of 
fine sediments were registered in the same periods 
that there were observed limnetic conditions inside 
the southern portion of the lagoon, reinforcing

for the recruitments observed at the southern shoals 
(Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), in which the success 
of the bivalve recruitments is found to be related 
to the hydrologic conditions (Bemvenuti  et  al., 
1978, 1992).

The larval settlement registered in the present 
study occurred simultaneously to the environmental 
changes on later summer/03-autumn/03, when 
there were registered increments in the salinity 
values and decreasing percentages of fine sediments 
into the substrate. Taking into account that the 
recruitments of E. mactroides generally occur on 
spring and summer seasons, post-settled juveniles 
could have been experienced several displacements 
caused by the intense freshwater discharge in this 
period.

These post-settled individuals could also have 
been subjected to mortality events after settlement 
due to the El Niño harsh conditions, like high 
water discharges and elevated percentages of fine 
sediments. These mortality events at the initial life 
stages of the bivalves are not easy to detect due to 
their small body size and the absence of a calcified 
shell, characteristics that difficult their conventional 
sampling and accelerate their decomposition.

Greater densities of E. mactroides were found 
during autumn-winter/03 due to recruitments 
and consequent development of their initial life 
stages. From winter/03 throughout the study, there 
were observed successive reductions in the species 
densities, suggesting the existence of conditions 
that do not afford the persistence in time of these 
populations inside the estuarine region.

In a spatial-temporal evaluation concerning 
E. mactroides in Laguna Rocha (coastal region from 
Uruguay), it was found that the species is adapted 

the macrobenthic assemblages at the shoals inside 
this lagoon (Colling et al., 2007). The influence of 
the El Niño anomaly was also evaluated by a long-
term study concerning the temporal variability of 
the macrofauna from Port Curtis estuarine region 
(Australia), where there were registered negative 
consequences to the macrozoobenthic communities 
due to the increase of freshwater inflow towards the 
estuary (Currie and Small, 2005), as well as observed 
to the Tamar Estuary, England (Bale et al., 2006).

The beginning of E. mactroides recruitments 
were observed on later summer/03, being the first 
organisms found on February 2003, the same period 
in which it was registered the lower influence of the 
El Niño phenomenon, with increasing salinity and 
OM contents; and decreasing discharges, water 
level rates and fine sediments percentages. New 
recruitments (by the input of juvenile organisms) 
were not observed until the end of this study.

Through sur veys on distribution of the 
macrobenthic fauna inside the Patos Lagoon, it was 
observed a wide spatial distribution of E. mactroides 
along the whole lagoon area and inside its southern 
estuarine region (Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998). This 
bivalve species occupies great areas in its oligohaline 
northern portion, where there were found at all the 
size classes, high density of adults (reproductive 
stock) and elevated biomass due to the large size of 
the individuals. On the other hand, only juvenile 
bivalves younger than one year old are registered 
in the southern portion, in which the species 
recruitment is considered potentially unsuccessful 
(Bemvenuti et al., 1978).

Following the freshwater discharge during the 
spring-summer periods, the larvae of E. mactroides 
that come from the northern region are responsible

the experiments on sediment deposition.

Instability at the bottom’s surface can also be 
a cause of stress to suspension feeder bivalves due 
to post-settled larvae ressuspension, burying and/
or recruitment suppression (Rhoads and Young, 
1970). Moreover, suspension feeder organisms 
are sensible to intense silt and clay depositions, 
presenting then severe mortality (Levinton, 1995). 
In this sense, short-siphon bivalves like E. mactroides 
are also susceptible to massive mortalities due 
to the clogging of their filter-feeding apparatus, 
like previously observed for the bivalve Rangia 
cuneata Sowerby, 1831 (Peddicord, 1977). Field 
experiments on adults of R. cuneata have shown 
that mortality was higher and growth was slower 
for those individuals on fine sediments than for 
those growing on sandy substrate (Tenore, 1968). 
Furthermore, the growth of R. cuneata adults was 
faster in clams placed in sand than those in mud 
(Peddicord, 1976), evidencing a great recruitment 
success associated to coarse sediments.

This work showed that the input of juveniles 
into the southern estuary, which depends of 
the discharge regime from its upper portion, 
characterizes the recruitments of E. mactroides as 
temporally unpredictable southwards. The present 
evaluation concerning the interactions between 
the species temporal variability and the hydrologic 
characteristics of the estuarine region give support 
to understand the dynamic from one of the 
major macrobenthic components, evidencing the 
species relationship to small-scale environmental 
parameters and global events of low predictability 
like El Niño phenomenon. Moreover, mortality 
events and substrate dynamics were found to be 
linked, evidencing that fine deposition processes can 
interfere in the recruitment success and temporal 
persistence of E. mactroides at shoals inside estuarine 
regions.

transport in macrotidal estuaries. Sedimentary Geology, 

to the continuous changes in such system, being 
favored by the open/close regimes of a sandy bar 
that separates the lagoon from the adjacent marine 
environment. Furthermore, the adaptability of this 
bivalve to colonize mixohaline environments, in 
which salinity values range from near zero to 20, 
suggests that salinity in Laguna Rocha apparently 
do not interfere in the spatial distribution of this 
species (Jorcin, 1996).

In estuarine environments, the suspended 
matter experience depositional processes due to the 
reduction in the flux velocity and flocculation of 
particles when in contact to salty waters (Postma, 
1980; Niencheski and Windom, 1994). Regular 
deposition and ressuspension of fine sediments are 
able to result in fluid mud deposits (Allen  et  al., 
1980), determining dynamic events on the shallow 
estuarine bottoms that can directly interfere in the 
development of macrobenthic species (Ysebaert 
and Herman, 2002; Teske and Wooldridge, 2003; 
Thrush  et  al., 2003) and sub-superficial bivalves 
like E. mactroides. Mortality events were previously 
observed in the Patos Lagoon estuarine shoals after 
E. mactroides recruitments (Bemvenuti et al., 1978; 
Bemvenuti and Netto, 1998), being suggested the 
relationship between mortality and deposition of 
fine sediments at shallow embayments (Bemvenuti, 
1997a), besides not quantified. The mortality events 
registered in the present work on August-September 
2003, April-May 2004 and October-November 
2004 evidenced the occurrence of adverse conditions 
to the species development at the shoals in the 
southern estuarine portion. Simultaneously to the 
mortality events, the quantification of depositional 
events evidenced that the input of fine sediments 
(silt + clay) in the substrate interferes negatively on 
the bivalves’ survival.

The winter/03 was also marked by a pronounced 
salinity variation inside the estuarine region, 
with fortnightly means ranging from near zero 
to 10  during short periods. Periods of freshwater 
discharge associated with marine water inflows 
induced by S winds cause a vertical stratification 
which results in a saltwedge formation (Niencheski 
and Baumgarten, 1997). Furthermore, the 
interactions between the geomorphologic features 
of the estuary in its southern portion and the 
penetration of marine water during strong S winds, 
can both favor the ressuspension of fine sediments 
deposited inside the estuarine area (Niencheski 
and Windom, 1994; Niencheski and Baumgarten, 
1997).
