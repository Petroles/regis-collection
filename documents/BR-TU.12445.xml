ABSTRACT  

This work is presented in two complementary parts covering the two main fields 

on the study of cultural heritage.  

The first one is focussed on the analysis of a set of six dinheiros from the first 

Portuguese dynasty (13
rd

 and 14
th

 centuries). The coins were analyzed using ?-Energy 

Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence in order to evaluate their elemental composition, 

allowing to confirm in four of the coins a billon alloy (copper/silver) and in the 

remaining two a reduced content of silver. This fact is compatible with the social and 

economic Portuguese reality during D. Fernando I reign. The coins were further 

evaluated by means of X-ray Diffraction identifying natives copper and silver, as well 

as some of their degradation products, such as cuprite, tenorite, malachite, nantokite and 

atacamite and on the numisms with high silver content, chlorargyrite. By making use of 

Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy the morphological 

analysis on the coins surface was performed evidencing the corroded surface and 

allowing to identify different morphologies corresponding to copper/copper oxides and 

silver/silver chloride phases.  

On the second part, several calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydroxide 

functionalized nanoparticles were synthesized, purified and physicochemical 

characterized, in order to study their application by dispersion, on manuscripts and its 

similar for conservation purposes. The effect of different percentages of the 

functionalizing agent (dodecanoic acid) was investigated. Results from the visual and 

turbidimetry analyses showed that the dispersions were not stable for the proposed end. 

By making use of Attenuated Total Reflectance and X-ray Diffraction was possible to 

conclude that the acid is present on the final CaCO3 product. Scanning Electron 

Microscopy allowed to prove the morphological changes on the powders particles and 

made clear the shortage of nano-objects. The followed route is not effective regarding 

the synthesis of nanoparticles which may justify the instability of the dispersions.

RESUMO 

Este trabalho é composto por duas partes distintas mas complementares e que 

diferem apenas na base em estudo. Abrangem-se assim dois dos campos fundamentais 

no estudo do património cultural, nomeadamente, a avaliação do estado de conservação 

de um conjunto de moedas antigas, seguido pela proposta de um método para a 

preservação do papel e seus similares.  

 

A primeira parte da investigação foca-se na análise de um conjunto de seis 

dinheiros datados da primeira dinastia Portuguesa (séculos XIII e XIV), particularmente 

dos reinados de D. Sancho II (1223-1248); D. Afonso III (1248-1279); D. Dinis 

(1279-1325); D. Pedro I (1357-1367) e D. Fernando I (1367-1383). Este trabalho 

baseia-se na avaliação do estado de conservação dos numismas, por meio da 

identificação e caracterização dos produtos que constituem a sua patina bem como as 

alterações morfológicas a que a sua superfície esteve sujeita devido à sua interação com 

o ambiente circundante. Tenta-se ainda propor um mecanismo de corrosão porém 

devido à falta de informação sobre o local da descoberta, o estado do enterro/desenterro 

ou mesmo das datas relacionadas com qualquer um destes processos, esta investigação é 

um desafio tanto a nível do estudo da sua camada de corrosão como a nível do 

património cultural.  

De salientar que os dinheiros foram as primeiras moedas portuguesas, cunhadas 

em liga de bolhão (maioritariamente constituída por cobre, seguido de prata e alguns 

elementos químicos minoritários). Estas moedas estiveram em circulação, em Portugal, 

desde meados do século XII até, aproximadamente, 1502. Mais ainda, patina é a camada 

que reveste a superfície do metal, no seu estado puro ou em liga, sendo constituída por 

todos os compostos químicos, nomeadamente produtos de corrosão e outros elementos 

exógenos formados e mantidos na superfície do objeto, alterando a sua cor e textura. 

Urge considerar o sistema liga/patina/ambiente como um sistema global, em que a 

patina resulta das interações físico-químicas entre a liga e o ambiente, ao longo do 

tempo.  

A ação combinada de técnicas analíticas não destrutivas como a espectrometria de 

micro-Fluorescência de raios-X de Energia Dispersiva (?-EDXRF), a Difração de 

raios-X (XRD) e a Microscopia Eletrónica de Varrimento acoplada com a técnica de 

Espectroscopia Dispersiva de raios-X (SEM/EDS) permitem identificar a natureza dos 

produtos da patina formados no conjunto de moedas estudadas, contribuindo para 

compreender e preservar a história das sociedades e ajudar à preservação dos mesmos. 

Do ponto de vista macroscópico e por meio de análise visual pôde concluir-se que, de 

um modo geral, as superfícies das moedas se encontravam bem definidas e preservadas, 

dado o seu período de origem. Todas as moedas apresentavam uma coloração 

preta-acastanhada e, em alguns casos, uma coloração acobreada nas zonas de 

alto-relevo. Exceção feita à face de uma das moedas que apresentou, pontualmente, 

sinais típicos de corrosão do tipo “couve-flor”. Vários tipos de patinas foram 

identificados, a saber uma camada amarelo-acastanhado nas áreas de baixo-relevo e, 

localmente, colorações verde (baixo-relevo) e vermelho-acastanhado (cobrindo a 

superfície) em todas e/ou alguns dos numismas.  

As moedas foram analisadas usando ?-EDXRF de modo a quantificar a sua 

composição elementar. Com recurso a esta técnica foi possível proceder à confirmação 

da liga de bolhão em todas as moedas notando-se porém uma redução do teor de prata 



v i  |  P a g e  

 

nas duas moedas datadas do reinado de D. Fernando I. Este facto é comprovado pela 

realidade social e económica à época, onde era já conhecida a depreciação do metal. Por 

meio da técnica de XRD foi possível identificar cobre (Cu), prata (Ag) e chumbo (Pb) 

nativos bem como alguns dos seus produtos de degradação, nomeadamente cuprite 

(Cu2O), tenorite (CuO), malaquite (Cu2CO3(OH)2), nantoquite (CuCl) e atacamite 

(Cu2Cl(OH)3) e, nos dinheiros com teor de prata mais elevado, cloroargirite (AgCl). As 

moedas foram ainda analisadas com recurso à técnica SEM/EDS tendo sido possível 

observar a morfologia das suas superfícies. Estas apresentavão sinais característicos de 

corrosão tendo sido identificadas, maioritariamente, fases ricas em cobre/óxidos de 

cobre e prata/cloreto de prata.  

A interação ente o ambiente e o material metálico tornou-se assim evidente 

permitindo assinalar a presença de elementos exógenos à liga, tais como silício, cloro, 

cálcio, fósforo, potássio, e, possivelmente, ferro e mercúrio. Os resultados de ?-EDXRF 

permitiriam ainda avançar para a possível constituição da liga através da identificação 

de cobre e prata, bismuto, ouro e, provavelmente, antimónio, chumbo e ferro como parte 

do minério. A evolução da camada de corrosão pode ser assumida como tendo início 

aquando da formação da cuprite e, em concordância com a interface metal/meio, a sua 

consequente conversão noutros compostos químicos. O significativo teor de ião cloreto 

(Cl
-
) registado, quer através das técnicas de análise elementar quer pela identificação 

dos seus produtos de degradação (CuCl, AgCl e Cu2Cl(OH)3), pode indicar a exposição 

a um ambiente marinho (rico em iões Cl
-
). Estes resultados são compatíveis com a 

geografia costeira de Portugal. Mais ainda, os iões Cl
-
 induzem geralmente um processo 

de corrosão autocatalítica em artefactos ricos em cobre, o que pode explicar o facto de 

duas das moedas com teores de Cl
-
 mais elevados, serem aquelas que apresentam 

maiores sinais de corrosão. Finalmente é importante notar que outros produtos de 

patina, como por exemplo compostos amorfos, nomeadamente, outros óxidos, fosfatos 

ou sulfatos, poderão também estar presentes na superfície das moedas.  

 

A segunda parte do presente trabalho tem como base a síntese, purificação e 

caracterização físico-química de várias nanopartículas de carbonato de cálcio (CaCO3) e 

hidróxido de cálcio (Ca(OH)2) funcionalizadas com ácido dodecanoíco (DA), com o 

objetivo de estudar a sua aplicação, por dispersão, em manuscritos e seus similares com 

o propósito da sua conservação.  

O efeito de diferentes percentagens de agente funcionalizante bem como diversos 

solventes orgânicos apolares e as condições de realização das dispersões foram 

estudados; tendo-se concluído que o solvente que apresentou os resultados mais 

satisfatórios foi o ciclohexano, quando sujeito ao maior número de ciclos ultrassónicos 

aplicados. Por outro lado os resultados da análise visual e da turbidimetria, técnicas 

usadas para avaliar a estabilidade das dispersões, mostraram que estas não são estáveis 

para o fim proposto uma vez que as dispersões obtidas se demonstraram instáveis por 

um período de tempo estipulado de 18 h a 24 h. Embora o ciclohexano tenha sido o 

solvente que apresentou os resultados mais promissores outros solvents, além dos 

estudados, deveriam ser testados. Com base nestes resultados, os estudos seguintes 

foram realizados apenas para os pós de CaCO3 compostos por percentagens de 0.0% e 

5.0% de DA.  

Com recurso às técnicas de Refletânica Total Atenuada (ATR) e XRD 

verificou-se a presença do ácido no produto final de CaCO3 funcionalizado com 5.0% 

de DA. Mais ainda, por combinação dos resultados de ambas as práticas foi possível 

identificar calcite e aragonite no produto sem funcionalização (0.0% DA), ao passo que, 

no produto hidrofóbico (5.0% DA) foram identificadas fases relativas à calcite, vaterite 



v i i  |  P a g e  

 

e aragonite bem como do sal do ácido carboxílico (Ca(C12H23O2)2). Finalmente, o SEM 

permitiu observar alterações morfológicas resultantes da introdução do agente 

funcionalizante bem como provar a não existência de nanopartículas. Em qualquer um 

dos pós obtidos a carência de nanomateriais tornou-se evidente tendo sido possível 

identificar aquilo que parecem ser clusters de nano-objectos.  

A reduzida quantidade de nanopartículas provocou uma redução drástica no 

número de partículas passíveis de dispersão pois devido ao seu tamanho, estas não têm 

capacidade de penetrar (tão) profundamente no interior da superfície do papel 

tornando-se pouco eficazes contra a acidez interna da base. Pode assim concluir-se que 

a reação, segundo as condições específicas aplicadas, embora eficaz na produção dos 

pós sintetizados se mostrou pouco eficiente para produzir nanopartículas, justificando 

assim a instabilidade das dispersões obtidas.

1 INTRODUCTION 

The thorough knowledge of an archaeological object with its various aspects is a 

precondition to any applied research. Investigations involving chemical and physical 

non-destructive instrumental methods contribute greatly to understand and preserve the 

history of societies.  

The present work will be presented in two separate but complementary parts. The first 

approach (Evaluation on the degradation state of antique coins by spectroscopic techniques) 

is based on the assessment on the conservation state of antique Portuguese coins by 

identification and understanding of its corrosion products and surface morphologic changes. 

While the second part (Development of nanomaterials for Cultural Heritage Conservation) is 

result of the synthesis, purification and physical-chemistry characterization of several calcium 

carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) nanoparticles hydrophobically 

functionalized with dodecanoic acid (DA), to application on manuscripts for conservation 

purpose.  

In consequence the two main fields on the study of cultural heritage are covered: the 

investigation on the state of conservation of an object and a proposal to a conservation mode. 

In this particular case the studied objects are different but the approach is highlighted. 

Annexe I presents a list of important definitions and concepts that are going to be use 

on this work.  

1.1 COINS 

Coins are particular and important findings during archaeological investigations as 

source of documentation, understanding and knowledge of people and their societies.  

Once these objects play an important role in any national cultural heritage, this study 

represents a very important step in the first Portuguese dynasty billon coins characterization. 

It is focus on a set of six dinheiros dated from the 13
rd

 and 14
th

 centuries, namely from 

D. Sancho II (1223-1248); D. Afonso III (1248-1279); D. Dinis (1279-1325); D. Pedro I 

(1357-1367) and D. Fernando I (1367-1383). Due to the limited knowledge, in particular the 

lack of information about the place of find, state of burial/dig up or even its related dates (the 

numisms could have been buried, submerged or even exposed to other kind of environments) 

this investigation is a challenge on both corrosion science and cultural heritage. Is thus 



 

2  |  P a g e  

 

justified the importance of a detailed analysis in order to gain intensive information about 

chemical composition, nature of the patina and corrosion features on the coins.  

1.1.1 Coin history and social impact 

The invention of coins resumes to the 650/700 b.C. and since that time they have been 

used as a medium of exchange. These metal objects are standardized in weight and produced 

in large quantities at a mint (coinage house).  

Numismatics
1
 and the study of the coins´ chemical composition (surface and bulk) give 

important information about the culture, economy and science of a society [1, 2, 3]. For 

example, the study on the coin depreciation (by reducing the precious metal content) can be 

correlated to the economic decline as evidence on periods of economic difficulties [4, 5].  

Portuguese dinheiros  

Portugal's independence was proclaimed by D. Afonso Henriques on 25 July 1139, 

being the first Portuguese coins (dinheiros) issued by him. Dinheiros (minted in billon alloy) 

were the currency of Portugal from the late 12
nd 

century until, approximately, 1502.  

Various kinds of coins were introduced in the Portuguese culture during the first 

dynasty. Around 1200, a gold currency was produced and a century later a silver coin was 

introduced [6].  

The set of the studied dinheiros, their respective kingdom, date, schematic figures and 

the mint houses are presented on Table 1.1.

D. Sancho II known as the “Cowled One” was born in Coimbra, in 1209, and his death 

is reported to 1248 in exile (Toledo). He ascended to the throne in 1223 and was deposed by 

the Holy See due his political and personal ideas, in 1245. Sancho II introduced a great 

development in minting once the coinage necessity grew due the increasing of the commercial 

transactions [1].  

The “Bolognese” or D. Afonso III became king of Portugal in 1248. He was born in 

Coimbra (1212) and died in Lisbon (1279). Afonso III extended his domain conquering the 

southward to Algarve and gave Portugal its definitive boundaries. This king produced several 

legislation regulating minting alloys, weights and alterations in coins [1]. 

D. Dinis, the “Husbandman”, was born in Lisbon in 1261, ascended to the throne in 

1279, and died in Santarém in 1325. During his time, the land was colonized and cultivated; 

industry grew stronger and the external commerce expanded protected by an organized navy 

and defended by treaties and protective laws [1]. With D. Dinis the first Portuguese university 

(“Estudo Geral”) was established in Lisbon (1290) being later transferred to Coimbra (1308) 

[8]. As a consequence, Latin gave way to Portuguese language and started to be used on 

official documents and diplomas.  

D. Pedro I known as the “Just” or the “Cruel” was born in 1320 (Coimbra), died in 1367 

(Estremoz) and acceded to the throne by death of his father (D. Afonso IV) in 1357. During 

his reign the economic situation of the country improved and prospered. Despite its political 

internal instability, trade was carried on the most important ports of Europe [1]. 

D. Fernando I known as the “Handsome” (Coimbra, 1345 – Lisbon, 1383) ascended to 

the throne in 1367 being the last king of the first Portuguese dynasty. Fernando I was 

involved in unending and unprofitable wars against the Castile which created enormous 

economic and financial difficulties. In fact, the coinage reflected his irregular and dissolvent 

administration. He changed and created new types and denominations to mask the weakening 

and debasement of the alloy (impoverishing in metal) in relation to the inflated nominal 

values it represented [1].  

After the death of D. Fernando I, Portuguese people reacted against his Castilian 

succession and required the protection of the “Master of the Order of Avis”, who acceded to 

the throne in 1385, founding the second Portuguese dynasty.  

1.1.2 Chemical composition of coins  

Compositional information constitutes a fundamental tool in the study of antique coins. 

Studying the elemental composition pattern of the alloy, its fineness and debasement, can 



 

4  |  P a g e  

 

provide valuable information either to provenance studies or for investigations of 

manufacturing processes, as well as identification of authenticity [4, 5, 9-11].  

Billon was one of the most important and common alloys used for minted coins since 

the ancient Greece. However, only a few studies were made on Portuguese antique coins 

(Guerra et al. [10, 12], Martins et al. [13-15] and Mata et al. [16, 17]) being the most 

notorious conclusion that these coins were mostly constituted by copper (approximately 

90.0%), silver (around 8.0%) and some minor elements.  

(i) Copper  

Copper (Cu) occurs naturally as native Cu or alloyed with other elements. In both states 

it forms a large group of industrially important materials owing to its appealing visual 

appearance, excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, mechanical workability and 

resistance [18-20].  

Native copper identification with silver and locally arsenic as major impurities is highly 

desirable in artefacts because it is generally held that the working metals began with the use 

of pure copper [21]. According to Pernicka [21] the presence of volatile metals such as 

mercury (Hg) could provide chemical evidence for the presence of native copper; however 

this element can also be absorbed on copper from groundwater during the burial, inducing 

inaccurate conclusions.  

Historically, the main working processes on this element were the cold working 

process
2
; annealing

3
, smelting

4
 and re-melting

5
. It is important to retain that the ores were 

generally inhomogeneous showing zoning effects, and some elements could be lost during 

any of these processes. Even more, after the smelting process finding alloying copper with 

other metals was very common. Numerous copper alloys exist, many with important uses. 

Apart from billon; brass is a copper-zinc alloy and bronze usually denotes copper-tin alloys 

yet can refer to any alloy of copper (e.g. aluminium bronze). The metal composition of bronze 

alloys and its deterioration processes has been examined numerous times [2, 5, 9, 17, 21-30].  

(ii) Silver  

Silver (Ag) and its alloys have been used in many objects of cultural heritage due to its 

luxuriousness, luster and intrinsic value. Even more, the surface enrichment of archaeological 

copper alloys, either intentional or due to corrosion processes, has been known for many years 

and it is of main interest for a chronological assignment [31, 32].

5  |  P a g e  

 

The application of a layer of silver onto the surface of a low noble metal (silver surface 

enrichment) was possible by using chemical, mechanical, thermo-mechanical or physical 

treatments [5, 33]. All of this processes varied greatly from time to time and place to place. 

Particularly the presence of areas in the coin with higher content of silver is a normal 

behaviour in billon alloys due to the low solubility of silver in copper, and vice versa, at room 

temperature. Based on Martins and Martins [15] the solubility of Cu in Ag is of 8.0% at 

780° C, and practically zero at room temperature. During cooling, the system separates each 

component in the pure state with the same reticular structure as the one in the supersaturated 

solid solution; so the formation of rich areas of silver dispersed in copper matrix depends on 

the rate of cooling and thickness of the sample.  

Silver was not the only metal applied to the surface of the coins in order to give them a 

rich and shine appearance. Other intentional plating elements were carried out with antimony 

or arsenic, for example.  

(iii) Minor elements  

There are a number of factors which can give rise to systematic variations in the 

concentration levels of minor elements in antique copper alloys, including, for example, the 

mineralogy of the copper ore source; partition, volatilisation and contamination of trace 

elements (from various sources) during the smelt between metal and slag phases; the 

deliberate addition of other metals (e.g. tin or lead) to the finished metal; co-smelting of 

different ores to produce alloys directly; the poly-metallic ore sources that would naturally 

create alloys in the smelt; and changes in chemistry through melting, re-melting and working 

of the metal [25].  

Elements such as lead, tin, antimony or zinc, nickel and cobalt, gold or even silver can 

be present on the surface of copper alloy coins [5, 10, 21, 23, 28, 34]. Lead (Pb) due to its 

compact structure and large atoms forms a good alloy with other elements in particular with 

copper [23]. Concerning the presence of this element on the coin surface, it is related to its 

very low solubility in copper and its low melting temperature with respect to that of the 

copper matrix, which causes the formation of fine particles dispersed throughout the copper 

[5]. Generally, less amount of lead is an effective evidence for a good refining process [21, 

34]. Ingo et al. [5] put forward the hypothesis that the presence of antimony (Sb) could have 

been enhanced by the craftsmen, firstly during the blank production thus inducing the 

occurrence of the inverse segregation phenomenon on the outermost region.  



 

6  |  P a g e  

 

The hypothesis that minor elements concentrations should be a guide to the provenance 

of antique metals has been around for more than a hundred years and explored for decades 

[10, 21]. The content of these elements can be governed by ore composition or related to the 

smelting process. In fact changes on minor elements levels give important information about 

the ore provenance [12]. 

1.1.2.1 Provenance  

The most difficult question in numismatics is the attribution of provenance [10]. Either 

the mine is known and the goal is to correlate the objects to it, or the mine is unknown and the 

target it to determine which mine was exploited to make the objects. However, the place of 

origin/burial is of great importance to understand the mechanism of the phenomena 

responsible for the deterioration.  

Based on literature [15, 21, 25] it is possible to elaborate Table 1.2 which presents a list 

of elements that were deliberately alloyed with copper as well as those stemming from the ore 

extraction. Only a very limited range of trace elements are directly related to the provenance 

of the ore. Even more, in earlier times it cannot be assumed that deliberate alloying occur.

1.1.2.2 Manufacturing  

Coin minting obeys to several laws of the monetary system (national and/or worldwide) 

and its values are linked to a monetary standard. Moreover, there is the intent to produce 

objects that will last and can be easily distinguished from one another.  

Ferraro Vaz [1] presents a resume about the antique Portuguese coins manufacturing 

process. According to this author, when a coin is hammered or milled the metal is prepared in 

disks and then submitted to the minting by manual pressure, marking them with the letters and 

figures (usually different) in both faces (obverse and reverse).  



 

7  |  P a g e  

 

Studies presented by Guerra [10] show that varying the ratio of some minor elements 

with respect to the major ones (usually silver, copper or gold) may indicate a deliberate 

addition of a specific element to the alloy, meaning a change in the manufacture technology.  

1.1.3 Coin deterioration  

Studies on corroded metallic archaeological artefacts are of great importance since they 

can improve knowledge in the field of the long-term corrosion phenomena providing help, to 

scientists and conservators, in order to control and stop the process of deterioration of historic 

metals in museums and in selecting their ideal storage conditions; or even on its historical and 

archaeological classification [11, 17, 28]. However metals are generally difficult materials to 

analyze once they might have been re-melted and reused in new minting or for producing 

other objects [10]. 

Coins are very sensitive samples to the effect of deterioration processes. Their state of 

conservation depend on normal wearing processes before and after burial, being the extent 

and depth of the corrosion phenomena closely dependent on the corrosive environment 

(chemical composition, pH, resistivity, etc) and other non-negligible parameters, such as the 

type of electrolyte and the alloy microstructure, historical periods, metallurgical techniques or 

even the kind and size of the artefact [2, 15, 28, 29].  

Based on these assumptions the interaction of archaeological artefacts with the 

neighbouring environment becomes very important in the field of preservation and corrosion. 

Most studies of different environmental conditions (soils [28, 35, 36], atmosphere [37- 43] 

and marine exposure [18, 28, 44, 45]) tried to establish the correlation between the artefacts 

chemical composition, its surroundings and their patinas structures.  

Apart from corrosion occurring in air and wet soil it has to be considered that such 

leaching phenomena can also be caused by chemical treatments of the objects. In organic or 

inorganic acidic solutions the less noble constituents of the alloy are dissolved, while the 

nobler components, e.g. silver or gold, are enriched at the surface [32].  

1.1.3.1 Coin patina  

Patina is a coating of all chemical compounds such as corrosion products (namely, 

oxides, carbonates, sulphides and sulphates, nitrites and nitrates, phosphates, etc.) and other 

exogenous elements (silicon, calcium, etc.) formed and retained on the surface of the pure or 

alloyed metal, changing its surface texture and colour [6, 40, 46]. It can be produced and 

changed by chemical processes, wear, polishing, age, or, principally, due exposure to 



 

8  |  P a g e  

 

atmospheric elements (air, rain, soil, etc.). As that it is important to consider the 

alloy/patina/environment as a global system in which the patina must be regarded as the result 

of the physicochemical interactions between the alloy and the environment, with time [29].  

Patinas are built up during relatively short periods of time (6-50 years) with respect to 

the total conservation environment duration (hundreds to thousands of years). Once formed, 

patina layer is relatively stable and it becomes a permanent part of the object acting as a 

protective barrier, attenuating or eliminating the corrosive phenomena [13, 40, 41]. Copper 

patinas are generally regarded as aesthetically pleasing to the point of being purposely 

deposited on the metal surface by artists and metalworkers.  

1.1.3.2 Usually compounds and their formation reactions  

Corrosion of archaeological artefacts is studied through the analyses of its patina 

products. The knowledge of its constituents is the first step to understand the corrosion 

mechanism. Since the morphology of the patinas, their adhesion and degree of porosity are 

dependent on the climatologically conditions, nature and level of pollutants, each metal 

behaves in a different way and forms specific compounds that reflect the chemical properties 

of the metal and the environment to which it is exposed. 

Initially the interface metal/medium is formed by cuprite (Cu2O) (Reaction 1.1) [13, 15, 

27, 40, 41, 46]. This compound is also the dominating phase that constitutes about half of the 

total patina mass [40] and it growths proceeds for years, centuries, or millennia, and may 

reach thicknesses of the order of several tens of micrometers [13].  

              Reaction 1.1 

Since Cu2O suffers an increasing rate of nucleation with increasing the relative 

humidity (RH), due the higher quantity of adsorbed water clusters that acts as nucleation sites, 

its reaction formation is RH dependent [43]. Reaction 1.2 shows the cuprite oxidation, 

noticing that it does not take place any further in the later stage of the corrosion [39, 46]. 

Moreover, oxidation of cuprite under atmospheric conditions must be slower than that of 

copper otherwise the intermediate cuprite would not exist. Reaction 1.4 represents the 

balanced redox reaction for the anodic and cathodic reactions in oxygen presence (Reactions 

1.2 and 1.3, respectively):

Cuprite is formed on the surface and later converted into other chemical compounds in 

agreement with the environment. Hydroxides and hydrated compounds of Cu (II) could be 

formed after the long-term (&lt;1000 years) due the interaction between the coins, its first patina 

layer and the corrosion environment [27].  

Table 1.3 presents a resume on the most commonly crystalline copper compounds 

found and studied over different patinas on copper and copper alloys artefacts.

Patina colours are directly connected to the nature of the corrosive environment and not 

to the composition of the alloy. However, they cannot be considered as a valid criterion for 

providing a quick identification of typical corrosion products.  

Depending on the environment, tenorite (CuO) (Reaction 1.5), malachite 

(Cu2CO3(OH)2) (Reaction 1.6), atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) (Reaction 1.7) and brochantite 

(Cu4SO4(OH)6) (Reaction 1.8) are the principal patina constituents on copper-silver alloys, 

being the three last ones only compatible with oxidizing conditions; while compounds as 

cuprite (Cu2O), chalcocite (Cu2S) and nantokite (CuCl) (Reaction 1.9) are formed under 

typical reducing conditions, unless the conditions varies imposed by organic and/or inorganic 

matter in the medium.

                 Reaction 1.9 

In fact what usually happens is the inter-conversion of cuprite, generally by its 

oxidation, into several different compounds according to the different environmental 

conditions. Beyond those exposed above, for example, azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2) (Reaction 

1.10) or paratacamite (Cu4Cl2(OH)6) (Reaction 1.11) formation reactions:  

                
 

                     
 Reaction 1.10 

                                Reaction 1.11 

Due Cu2O oxidation, pH of the aqueous layer increases, while the formation of copper 

sulphates (e.g. brochantite or posnjakite) and the presence of weak atmospherics acids (e.g. 

formic, acetic, oxalic and/or carboxylic acids) act as buffers making the pH reaming at its 

equilibrium for the sulphates formation, increasing the time of reaction [46]. Reaction 1.12 

shows the reaction on brochantite stability domain. Even more, posnjakite is a hydrated form 

of brochantite and could be formed as a precursor of it. Studies made by Fitzgerald et al. [46] 

show that pH increases until tenorite is formed on the surface of cuprite and stifled further 

oxidation. Brochantite dissolution and the formation of tenorite under these conditions are 

given by Reaction 1.13.  

         
                      

   Reaction 1.12 

                    
          

   Reaction 1.13 

There exists a critical SO2 deposition rate above which brochantite does not form and 

existing patinated surfaces will dissolve [46]. 

Some of these compounds can be used at screening for the coins “survival” for so many 

years. Even more, they can be associated with particular environments. Generally, malachite 

presence suggests that the object could be buried (in soil); brochantite has normally origin in 

the atmosphere contact; atacamite and paratacamite suggest the presence of chlorides in the 

place of burial (maybe near seawater) and chalcocite the presence of anaerobic reducing 

environments [15, 26].  

Finally, is important to notice that noble metals (e.g. Ag) accelerate corrosion, while the 

most catholically active ones (e.g. Pb, Sn) protect it during a certain period [13]. Silver does 

not react readily with the oxygen at room temperature. However, as shown before, adsorbed 

water layers into the oxide structure promotes irregularities that allow the penetration of 

corrosive ions. In consequence silver may suffer corrosion due to local action cells according 

to the Reactions 1.14 to 1.16 [14, 15]:

              Reaction 1.16 

Moreover, silver can also suffer attack by Cu (II) ions in the presence of chloride ions 

[15] as Reaction 1.17 shows:  

                        Reaction 1.17 

The silver chloride, although insoluble in water, does not grow as a protective coating 

on the surface, so this reaction is rendered decisively corrosive in the copper enriched areas 

being induced by oxygen and humidity [15].  

1.1.3.3 Patina structural aspects  

Divalent metal ions such as Cu
2+

 commonly form compounds with layered structures. 

Copper patina, typically, consists of two distinct layers: a 5-15 µm inner layer of essentially 

continuous cuprite and an external, porous layer, about 5-40 µm of basic copper sulphates, 

chlorides and carbonates [14, 17, 39, 40, 46]. However, it can continue to grow during many 

years or even decades of exposure and may reach a thickness of the order of several tens of 

micrometers [10, 40]. These layers are held together by sulphate groups, hydrogen bonds and 

weak Cu-O bonds and, in spite of the structural resemblance between the compounds, the fact 

is that the phases have different cell symmetry [40]. For example, native silver and native 

copper, cuprite, nantokite and chlorargyrite present a cubic crystal system; atacamite is 

orthorhombic; and malachite, tenorite, brochantite and azurite present a monoclinic cell 

symmetry. This structural resemblance suggests that one phase can act as seed crystal for the 

formation of a subsequent phase.  

Figure 1.1 shows a scheme for the general patina evolution on copper artefacts, 

displaying the formation of different compounds as a function of exposure time in different 

environments. One consequence of the gradual evolution of patina is that it gradually 

becomes less soluble and, hence more resistant to atmospheric corrosion [40].

Figure 1.1 – Patina evolution scheme on copper artefacts along time and environment of exposure. 

Robiola et al. [28] established a new structure patina classification of copper based 

alloys (particularly, Cu-Sn alloys), when exposed to an oxygenated corrosive medium. In 

resume, they assert that the corrosion patterns can be differentiated into two categories, 

according to patina colours, aspects and state of preservation of the original size of the object 

(i.e. the original surface limit) and based on its microstructures identification and 

characterization. Both categories can be observed on one and the same artefact. He et al. [27] 

later added that this double-structured deposit consist of an inner layer of Cu (I) salts and an 

external layer of Cu (II) compounds, which are depended on the history and the elemental 

composition of the object. Basically, Type I or “even” surface patinas build up under a mild 

corrosion condition and in a relatively short period of time being very protective and strongly 

influenced by the presence of incorporated soil components. While Type II or “coarse” 

surface patinas are thicker patinas formed when the original surface has been destroyed or 

deformed by severe corrosive attacks during the early stage of exposure.  

As the bronze corrosion process leads to a preferential dissolution of copper ions into 

the environment, exogenous elements (textiles or leather, insects, woods or even pure organic 

matters) can be entrapped in the corrosion layers or mineralised [29].  

1.1.3.4 Patina and the corrosive environment  

The importance of exploring the influence of environmental conditions on atmospheric 

corrosion rates of metals is justified by prediction of future corrosion rates as well as to 

control its degradation. Changes in land use, new large industries, afforestation, highway

engineering or lowering the groundwater table are some human factors which contribute for a 

change in the different environments.  

(i) Exposure to humidity and air pollutants  

Exposures to humidity or air pollutants create difficult multiphase systems to study. 

Several corrosive species and corrosion products that interact with each other are present and 

all of them vary in amount and time. Even more, humidity, precipitation and wind play an 

important role on the atmospheric pollutants transportation and deposition on the object.  

Electrochemical corrosion of copper is dependent on the type of metal as well as the 

pollutants present in the system. Once the metal dissolution occurs in presence of an 

electrolyte provided by atmospheric precipitation or by adsorption of water molecules on the 

surface of the corrosion layer, relative humidity plays a central role among the climatic 

factors. Especially since the presence of corrosive species which attract water vapour become 

soluble above a critical RH, lead to a sharp increase in the corrosion rate [39].  

Among the most abundant contaminants are sulphates, nitrates and nitrites, ozone, 

chlorides, carbonates, hydrogen ions, ammonium, metal ions, atmospheric particles and also 

organic compounds.  

Generally and based on literature [39, 42, 43] ozone (O3) has the strongest effect on the 

corrosion of copper followed by nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide (NO2 and SO2, 

respectively). Even more, O3 and NO2 led to a uniform corrosion attack while in the presence 

of SO2 a locally attack can be observed [39].  

Ozone is recognised to be a potential corrosion accelerator in corrosion research 

originating metal loss and hindering the passivation layer formation. This occurs possibly due 

O3 strong oxidative power and because it can produce hydroxyl radical, which is balanced by 

the metal dissolution [39]. Moreover, the exposure to ozone led to the formation of a 

considerable amount of water-soluble nitrites and to copper sulphite species oxidation, 

forming copper sulphates (CuSO4.xH2O) and increasing the Cu2O formation [39, 43].  

When exposed to NO2 the major species formed on the copper surface are: Cu2O and 

gerhardtite; moreover, when copper sulphide species are present this pollutant is able to 

oxidize them to CuSO4.xH2O [13, 38, 39, 42, 43]. In water rinses nitrate dominates over 

nitrite [43]. Formation of gerhardtite can be a result of nitric acid (HNO3) and dinitrogen 

pentoxide reactions [38, 39]. Due to the high water solubility of HNO3 this pollutant dissolves 

easily in the adlayer and the chemical reaction on the metal surface is enhanced leading to a 

decreased surface resistance.  



 

1 4  |  P a g e  

 

Sulphates can be supplied directly from rain water; via adsorption and oxidation of 

sulphur dioxide within the aqueous layer; or from aerosols [46]. However, deposition rates 

depend greatly on the nature and geometry of the surface. Adsorption of SO2 on copper 

surfaces is strongly influenced by RH [46]. The interaction between a water covered metal 

surface and SO2 can be described by Reactions 1.18 to 1.21 sequence:  

                Reaction 1.18 

            
      Reaction 1.19 

          
        

       Reaction 1.20 

      
      

   Reaction 1.21 

After deposition and dissolution of SO2 into the water layer (Reaction 1.18), a 

bisulphite ion (HSO3
-
) is formed by hydrolysis of sulphur dioxide (Reaction 1.19) producing 

a metal-sulphito surface complex (      
 ), through an exchange mechanism with the 

hydroxylated metal oxide surface (     ) (Reaction 1.20). Liquid metal-sulphito 

complexes (    
 ) subsequently detach from the metal-surface (M) and precipitate as solid 

corrosion products (Reaction 1.21) [42].  

The principal compounds found in copper patinas when exposed to SO2 rich 

environments are cuprite, basic copper sulphates and sulphites [13, 39, 40, 43].  

When sulphur- or chlorine-containing atmospheric species are more dominant, the 

patina formation reaction sequence becomes more complex and involves more copper patina 

constituents [40].  

Conventional atmospheric parameters that affect copper generally affects silver too 

comprising weathering factors (temperature, moisture, radiation, wind velocity, etc.), air 

pollutants and aerosols. In presence of a strong oxidizer, silver rate corrosion increases [37].  

(ii) Exposure to marine environments  

Marine environments, such as coastal or near-coastal countries as Portugal, are chloride 

(Cl
-
) rich environments.  

Urban atmosphere patinas are, in general, more adherent and uniform, than the ones 

exposed to chloride-rich environments. These last patinas are generally heterogeneous and 

present flaking and scaling, which allows localized corrosion; however, in the marine 

atmosphere patinas the degree of adhesion increases with time [18, 41, 44]. Zhang et al. [44] 

concluded that flaking mechanism associated to these loosely adherent patina layers is 

connected with the formation of nantokite.  



 

1 5  |  P a g e  

 

In chlorine-polluted environments a general stratification of corrosion products for a 

mature film is mainly composed of cuprite, as the initial phase in the evolution of the copper 

patina (inner layer), followed by the interfacial region in-between of CuCl which commonly 

transforms into the more voluminous corrosion product of atacamite or the isomorphous 

phase paratacamite, which correspond to the outer layer [6, 18, 40, 41, 44, 45]. According to 

Wallinder et al. [18] the composition of the outer part of the patina layer and its solubility 

properties are major factors that influence the extent of released metals, originating an 

increase of corrosion rates and the consequent metal loss. Even more, due paratacamite is 

most voluminous than nantokite, it induces internal physical stresses that leads to a separation 

between the inner patina layer and the outer deposit which induces the flaking process on 

copper [44]. This process is facilitated by the porous nature of the patina that allows 

penetration of moisture (water) and oxygen inducing an autocatalytic corrosion of copper [15, 

18, 44] according to Reactions 1.22 and 1.23. Moreover, He et al. [27] claim that on the 

archaeological copper alloys the chloride anion was one of the major causes for bronze 

corrosion in soil.  

                                Reaction 1.22 

                   Reaction 1.23 

The method of cuprite production in the presence of the Cl
-
 ion is a precipitation 

reaction. The equilibrium in Reaction 1.24 is shifted to the right as the local concentration of, 

e.g.      
  (Reaction 1.25) complex increases and Cu2O is deposited in response [45]:  

              
           

            
    Reaction 1.24 

      
               

       Reaction 1.25 

The stability of Cu2O is inversely dependent on the concentration of chloride ions. Thus 

the rate of re-dissolution of the protective cuprite is much higher than that observed in 

neutral/alkaline solution. An increasing pH resulting from the oxygen reduction reaction will 

favour the consumption of CuCl complex to form cuprous oxide [45]. According to Kear et 

al. [45] the buffering properties of seawater (due to the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate and 

borate ions) will act to limit any change in pH of the electrolyte adjacent to the active surface.  

(iii) Soil exposure  

Metal corrosion in soil media varies according the supply of an oxidizing agent (usually 

oxygen from the air) and the presence of an electrolyte (a water solution).  



 

1 6  |  P a g e  

 

The extension of the corrosive phenomena is dependent of several soil parameters, 

namely soil texture and grain size, soil acidity (pH, buffer capacity) and the amount of soluble 

salts, as well as their richness in chloride or phosphate and presence of soot, which affects the 

capillary of the soil giving more, or less, access to water and air [35, 36, 28]. Moderately 

aerated and moist soil above the ground water table (e.g. sand) generally promotes corrosion 

of metals giving access for O2 at the same time as the pores are partly filled with H2O. On the 

other hand a fine-grained soil or a coarse-grained soil (e.g. clay and gravel or pebble, 

respectively) should be less harmful. In fact, the aggressiveness of different soil types toward 

buried metal structures is a more important factor than the total age in years [35, 36]. 

It must be noticed that the chemical composition and properties of archaeological soils 

change over time as well as climate and activity on the site. In fact deterioration of buried 

metallic objects sensibly accelerated during the last 50-100 years, as a result of the 

technological progress and new agricultural practices [2, 28, 36].  

Especially well preserved metal objects are usually found in calcareous regions, or in 

peat or bogs due to the absence of oxygen. Copper phosphates are not generally found as 

corrosion products except in characteristic environments in association with decomposing 

buried bones and in arid climate [30]. In the presence of sulphur or sulphate-rich soils, 

generally produced by the decomposition of organic matter in an almost oxygen-free 

environments, posnjakite, brochantite and antlerite are the most common find compounds [13, 

30]. Finally, compounds formed from elements in the soil (Si and Al) and Pb may have 

resulted from corrosion of metallic objects associated with the use of weapons [16].  

1.1.3.5 Corrosion inhibitors  

To improve the protective efficiency of copper corrosion great efforts have been put 

into investigation and lots of technologies have been used [20; 47, 48, 49]. One of the most 

studied and avant-garde method for preventing the atmospheric corrosion of copper is the use 

of an appropriate inhibitor. Generally film assembling inhibitors based on green chemicals are 

preferred for this purpose [47]. However volatile corrosion inhibitors are the most effective 

and affordable for industrial use [48].  

The use organic molecules containing O, N, S and polar functional groups as corrosion 

inhibitors for copper and copper alloys have been widely investigated, in order to understand 

their strong adsorption on the metal surface by plugging the active sites and forming 

protective films on it, being its efficiency dependent on the film characteristics, namely the 

nature and the surface charge of the metal, the adsorption mode, its chemical structure and the 



 

1 7  |  P a g e  

 

type of the electrolyte solution formed [19, 20, 47-49]. Specially, amines and azole 

derivatives have been reported to be very effective inhibitors in acidic and neutral corrosion 

media [49] due their polar hydrophobic end groups which stabilizes the adsorption process 

[19, 47, 49].  

In the other hand, the main advantage of volatile corrosion inhibitors compared with 

conventional corrosion control methods, are their gas-phase transport that enables metallic 

surfaces to be reached. Even more, this films are very thin and do not interfere with 

subsequent use or treatment of the surface [48].  

In resume and based on literature, some examples on new corrosion inhibitors, are 

described in Table 1.4.

Tansug et al. [47] examined MMPB inhibition ability in acidic chloride media 

concluding that the high efficiency of it was related with its ability to complex with Cu (I) at 

the surface. Once the adsorbed molecules interact with each other along the carboxylate tails a 

film-like adsorption layer is formed on the surface [47]. BTAH and its derivatives can be used 

specifically for atmospheric Cu corrosion protection according to Chen et al. [48]. This 

compound acts as a mixed corrosion inhibitor interacting, via N atom, with the Cu (0) to form 

a thin protective film in non-corroded areas and with Cu (I) to outline a thick polymeric 

complex on the Cu2O substrate on the defect sites [48]. Qin et al. [20] studied the DMTD and 

Sherif et al. [49] used APT. In both cases a protective monolayer film against copper 

corrosion in acidic solution is formed. They are good inhibitors due their strong adsorption on 

the copper surface, increasing surface and polarization resistances.

1.2 PAPER  

The word "paper" is etymologically derived from papyrus, the word for the Cyperus 

papyrus plant and which was used to produce a thick, paper-like material by the ancient 

Egyptians, Greeks and Romans [50]. However papyrus and paper are different materials. The 

first one is a "lamination” of the natural plant, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose 

properties have been changed by maceration or disintegration.  

Due to its historical, scientific and social importance is easily understood the 

importance of paper conservation once it is one of the most fragile guardians of people 

cultural heritage.  

1.2.1 Paper history and social impact  

Papermaking has traditionally been traced to China, about 105 a.C., when T´sai Lun, an 

official attached to the Imperial court, created a sheet of paper using rags (textile waste) as the 

raw material. The earliest piece of paper found was discovered at Fangmatan (Gansu, China) 

inscribed with a map.  

Paper spread from China, through the Middle East to medieval Europe in the 

13
rd

 century and since that time, paper was the main material for recording cultural 

achievements all over the world [51]. Although the notion of paper being used as a practical 

everyday item, did not occur until the 15
th

 century, the advantages of mill-based papermaking 

spread throughout Europe in the 15
th

 and 16
th

 centuries [50, 52].  

On the 18
th

 and 19
th

 centuries Industrial Revolutions gave rise to new papermaking 

machinery that severely macerated the pulp and fast heat-dried the paper. Even more, the use 

of sulphuric acid and chloride as bleaches and the replacement of gelatine by alum-rosin for 

internal sizing
6
 made from this epoch one of the most important ones in paper history [53]. 

After the invention of printing, paper demand consistently increased and the methods of 

papermaking radically changed. In the middle of the 19
th

 century papermaking from rags was 

replaced by the use of wood pulp [54].  

Paper as a carrier for written information was introduced in Europe on the 20
th

 century 

[55]. In the past 50 years the rate of innovation in papermaking has increased rapidly and 

nowadays paper can be impregnated, enamelled, creped, waterproofed, waxed, glazed, 

sensitized, bent, folded, twisted, crumpled, cut, torn, dissolved, moulded and embossed [50].

1.2.2 Chemical composition of paper 

Paper has several components which can be classified according to their origin; 

chemical structure and function, note that wood-derived fibres are mainly composed of 

cellulose but also of lignin, hemicelluloses and other minor components; mineral particles 

acting as fillers (e.g. talc, kaolin, calcium carbonate, etc.); natural sizing agents (starch or 

rosin) or synthetic ones (alkyl ketene dimer or alkenyl succinic anhydride) which are 

generally acidic; colorants; functional groups forming during papermaking (e.g. aldehydes, 

ketones, carboxylic groups); metal ion impurities (mainly iron and copper); and other 

substances which can improve the characteristics of the paper for printing or writing and may 

also contribute to its degradation phenomena [51, 55, 56]. 

Antique paper was made entirely from rags, i.e. from linear long cellulose fibres only 

with the addition of sizing compounds; whilst contemporary paper can be manufactured from 

short fibres and may contain non-fibrous components in order to improve its properties. 

However the change of fibre source from cotton and linen rags to wood fibres and the use of 

alum rosin sizes had significant adverse effects on the permanence and durability of paper 

materials. Nevertheless, the ageing behaviour of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not 

the original source of the fibres [52]. As that, both paper composition and environmental 

conditions are decisive factors for the stability and durability of paper.  

1.2.2.1 Cellulose 

Cellulose is a long chain carbohydrate, natural polymer that gives wood its strength. It 

is the main component of plant cell walls and the basic building block for many textiles and 

for paper (almost 90% of paper constitution) [57]. Chemically, pure cellulose is a very stable 

material at ambient temperature [58]. 

 

Figure 1.2 – Cellulose structure: (a) two unlinked molecules of ß-D-glucose and (b) cellobiose.  

The links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar. These sugar units are bonded when 

water is eliminated by combining the -OH group with the H atom (Figure 1.2 (a)). Linking 

just two of these sugars produce a disaccharide called cellobiose (Figure 1.2 (b)); here

glucose units are linked through a ß-(1,4)-glycosidic bond originating long chains that form 

crystallites. Hereupon cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in 

the exactly same way to form regular, hard and stable regions that give the bundled chains 

more stability and strength [55, 57]. The length of the chain varies greatly from a few hundred 

sugar units, in wood pulp, to over 6000 for cotton, the purest natural form of cellulose [57]. 

1.2.2.2 Lignin  

Lignin is an amorphous, aromatic, water insoluble, heterogeneous, three dimensional 

(3D) and cross-linked polymer (Figure 1.3). This material is not composed of exactly 

repeating units and can be described better as a macromolecule than as a polymer.  

 

Figure 1.3 – Structural model of softwood lignin [59].  

Lignin gives woody plants their physical strength however it reduces the strength of 

paper by interfering with the way that cellulose fibres assemble. Its function is to provide a 

mechanically strong composite material with cellulose [60]. Moreover this macromolecule is 

the main cause of photo-yellowing of paper. In its structure are present several chromophores 

with conjugated aromatic rings and carbonyl groups that absorb in the near UV spectrum 

(300–400 nm). When these chromophores absorb light they can decompose into yellow 

coloured ketones and quinones, turning the paper yellow. Since these molecules themselves 

absorb visible light, they act as secondary chromophores and can react further, exacerbating 

the yellowing and degradation processes, this is why paper yellows with age [55, 60].

1.2.3 Paper deterioration  

Paper deterioration is a very slow and multi-parameter process. It is caused by 

endogenous (pH, metal ions, lignin, degradation products) and exogenous (RH, oxygen, light 

exposure, heat or pollutant gases) contributions. Paper chemical and mechanical properties, 

stability, degradation, etc. are strongly dependent upon the nature, origin and characteristics 

of cellulosic material as well as pulping and papermaking procedures, additives and its 

interactions, and storage conditions [55, 56].  

Chemical, physical and biological processes may cause irreversible structural changes 

in the constituting fibres, resulting in discoloration and embrittlement. In fact, paper 

deterioration means the weakening of inter-fibre bonds which results in an intrinsic decreased 

of strength due to cellulose deterioration. The modes of cellulose degradation within paper 

include chemical, which could be acid (producing formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids) or 

enzymatic hydrolysis, alkaline and oxidative degradation (which is mainly followed by a 

radical mechanism and has an important role in the natural ageing of paper); thermal 

(different levels of temperature) and radiation (exposure to UV/Visible and/or high-energy 

radiation); and by the presence of microorganisms or even with ink or printing media that are 

used historically in writing and illustrating [53-55, 60]. In these modes of cellulose 

degradation, crystallinity or fibrillar morphology plays a decisive role in determining the rate 

and also the course of the degradation process. A high supramolecular order of the polymer 

chain generally prevents degradation [52, 55].  

1.2.3.1 Manufacturing and storage 

During manufacturing and since the latter half of the 17
th

 century, hydrated aluminium 

sulphate was added as a sizing agent. At this time it was not yet known that this compound 

dissociates in water to form sulphate and hexaaquaaluminium(III) ions (          
  ) that 

can undergo acid hydrolysis (Reaction 1.26):  

          
                       

       
   Reaction 1.26 

During storage air pollutants play an important role on paper deterioration. Nitrogen 

dioxide can both form nitric acid on reacting with the moisture in paper (Reaction 1.27) 

and/or oxidise the hydroxyl groups on cellulose fibres to carboxylic acids, increasing the 

acidity of the paper (Reaction 1.28): 

                         Reaction 1.27 

                                                     Reaction 1.28 



 

2 2  |  P a g e  

 

Sulphur dioxide can form sulphuric acid on reacting with the moisture in the paper. In 

oxygen presence, the oxidation of SO2 followed by its hydration leads to acid production 

(redox Reaction 1.31 result from 1.29+1.30 reactions). This reaction can be catalyzed by the 

presence of certain metals (e.g. manganese) introduced in the paper making process.

                  Reaction 1.30 

                    Reaction 1.31 

1.2.3.2 Acid catalyzed degradation of cellulose  

Acidic-catalyzed degradation of paper is the most common degradation reaction. It is 

initiated by the acidic species (especially alum) introduced into the cellulose fibres during 

papermaking, causing its hydrolysis and reducing its degree of polymerization, eventually 

degrading the fibres until the paper is disintegrated [55]. In addition, acid from polluted 

atmospheres can enter the low-density, open regions of the fibre and cut the polymer chain.  

In general lignin, hemicellulose and hydrolyzed cellulose oxidize and produce 

substantial amounts of acidic products that breakdown the fibres. These acids further catalyze 

paper degradation and therefore this process is termed as “autocatalytic”. Reaction 1.32 [60] 

shows the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ?-(1-4)-glycosidic bonds in cellulose. This reaction 

shortens the cellulose fibres lengths which lead to a loss of paper strength [54].  

 

 

Reaction 1.32  

 

 

The extend of depolymerization following the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis depends on the 

acid strength and concentration as well as on temperature and duration of the reaction [56]. 

1.2.3.3 Alkaline degradation of cellulose  

When subjected to strong bases (such as Ca(OH)2 or alcoholate) cellulose chain ends 

can react and undergo a depolymerization reaction. Its alkaline degradation mechanism 

involves various steps, e.g. ?-alcoxy elimination (“peeling reaction” – Reaction 1.33 [58]) 

which explains the detrimental effect on paper permanence of excessively strong bases (B). 

When B species are exposed to air, they are rapidly transformed into the corresponding 

carbonate [55].

Reaction 1.33 

 

 

 

These reactions must be considered when treating cellulose-based works of art with 

alkaline solutions for restoration purposes (e.g. deacidification processes) [56]. 

1.2.3.4 Oxidation of cellulose  

The oxidative degradation of cellulose is primarily induced by the presence of oxygen 

which acts as a non-specific oxidizing agent via various complex mechanisms.  

Oxidation of cellulose introduces side groups (namely aldehydes and ketones) that make 

the molecule more easily hydrolyzed. Indeed these oxidized cellulose groups are known as 

“potential” sites of degradation because oxidized cellulose chains are not “actually” broken 

but they can easily degraded in both acidic and alkaline medium, even at mild concentrations 

and room temperature [55, 56]. Even more free radicals, generated by oxidation or by light, 

can also cut the cellulose chain. Both cellulose (and its derivatives) and lignin within the 

paper can be oxidised leading to discolouration.  

Reaction 1.34 shows the cellulose chain scission resulting from oxidation where (a) is 

the oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl to carbonyl originating a chain scission and (b) is the same 

process on the C2 hydroxyl resulting the keto-enol tautaumerization [58]. This process also 

contributes to raising the concentration of acid on paper.

1.2.3.5 Biological degradation of cellulose  

Various biological contaminants are possible even in libraries and archives, and their 

effect can vary as a function of environmental situations and composition of the substrate. 

Insects and moulds are the most common cause of biological problems. However stopping 

this type of detrimental evolution is not easy because its origin is frequently due to improper 

storing conditions [55]. For example, moulds proliferate and reproduce themselves in organic 

substrates like cellulose which will provide feed for development. These fungi produce 

enzymes that will chemically attack fibres and cleave cellulose macromolecules. Moreover, 

their metabolism will produce acidic wastes, which contribute to paper degradation [55].  

Gamma radiation eliminates insects and fungi in the paper, it has no residual toxicity or 

pollution and large volumes of material can be handled in short time [55]. 

1.2.3.6 Iron-gall ink corrosion  

Ink-induced corrosion of cellulose is a primary threat for paper documents of all kinds. 

Prevention of further iron-gall ink corrosion is a crucial issue in conservation science [61].  

Iron-gall inks were popular for several centuries until the mid-19
th

 century. 

Metallo-gallate inks are typically composed by iron sulphate salt, ferrous sulphate and other 

sulphates in trace amounts; and a vegetable tanning agent, commonly gallotannin extracts 

from gall apples [61]. This constituent’s act as powerful oxidation agents because large 

amounts of metals are present and these may lead to extensive localized degradation [55]. 

Depending on source and preparation, the iron sulphate also contains impurities, such as 

copper, zinc, aluminium and magnesium salts, establishing a complex system of different 

(de)stabilizing metal ions.  

Their main reaction is accomplished in two different steps, as Reaction 1.35 shows. 

First, gallic acid, formed by hydrolysis of the tannins extracts, reacts with ferrous cations 

from iron sulphate (FeSO4), in water, to form ferrous (II) gallate and sulphuric acid (a). After, 

in oxygen presence two molecules of this Fe (II) compound react, giving a 

ferric (III) pyrogallate and water (b).  

 

 

Reaction 1.35 

 

 



 

2 5  |  P a g e  

 

The presence of Fe (II) ions excess can catalyze the oxidation of cellulose through the 

production of hydrogen peroxide, according to the Fenton mechanism
7
, which induces severe 

degradation of paper by the loss of its mechanical properties (elasticity and tensile strength) as 

well as along the lines of the ink and the perforation of the inked areas [61, 62].  

1.2.4 Paper conservation 

Paper conservation is one of the most studied areas in the art and heritage conservation 

field. Particular and recently the nanosized particles subject.  

Alkaline nanosized particles, applied from non-aqueous dispersions have found to be 

particularly efficient for the preservation of cellulose-based materials which degradation is 

catalyzed by acidification processes developing in the paper and leading to chemical 

disruption of the cellulose polymer [63] as exposed before.  

It is well known today that the standard composition of paper should have an alkaline 

reserve (that is, the enough amount of buffer compounds capable of neutralizing acids) and 

have more than 1% lignin content, in way to prevent the paper deterioration. Deacidifying 

agents can provide this alkaline reserve, neutralizing the acidic groups present and avowing 

their acid hydrolysis. The use of non-acidic additives to make paper is becoming more 

prevalent and the stability of these papers is less of an issue. However an universal treatment 

of paper, able to deacidify, strengthen and protect against biological attack is still a challenge.  

1.2.4.1 Deacidification agents 

Deacidification is the neutralization of existing acids in the paper and a chelating step to 

inactivate the transition metal ions that are needed for a successful treatment [64]. This 

treatment is unavoidable in the preservation of paper because it provides a complete 

neutralization of paper and, in most cases, introduces an alkaline reservoir that opposes the 

incoming assault from the acidity present in the environment [65]. Correct deacidification 

process should produce the complete neutralization of the acidic paper and 

thermodynamically stable side products keeping the pH around 8-9 [54]. 

Although deacidification agents include strong bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 

the materials most often used for deacidification are weak bases, including carbonates, 

bicarbonates and some hydroxides, various oxides and amines [58]. Due the high compatible 

of these materials with the treated substrates it limits the drawbacks and ensures a long-lasting 

beneficial effect on the paper surface.

1.2.4.2 Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles  

Functionalization processes through nanoparticles surfaces can passivate, protect and/or 

functionalize them, for a specific goal. Based on literature [54, 63, 64] nanoparticles can be 

applied by spraying, brushing or immersion and their use does not require any special safety 

procedures. Their reactions and applications are usually simple to assemble and, in this 

particle case, relatively inexpensive.  

These materials have found fundamental applications for the compatible preservation of 

both immovable (e.g. consolidation of wall-paintings) and movable (e.g. deacidification of 

paper and wood artefacts) works of art [56]. They penetrate within the cellulose fibres on 

paper and neutralize the inherent acidity, causing a strong reduction in paper aging. One of the 

most important features about these nanoparticles is their capability of nucleation and growth 

due its significance for the formation of inorganic crystals control [56].  

(i) Carbonates  

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) occurs as three anhydrous crystalline polymorphs (calcite, 

aragonite and vaterite), in two crystal forms (hexahydrate ikaite and monohydrate) and also as 

amorphous material. While calcite, with a rhombohedral symmetry, is the most 

thermodynamically stable polymorph of this compound, under ambient conditions, the other 

two anhydrous crystalline forms are metastable in nature (orthorhombic aragonite and the 

hexagonal vaterite crystal systems). Aragonite changes to calcite at 380–470°C and vaterite is 

even less stable [66, 67].  

The applications of CaCO3 particles are determined by a number of strictly defined 

parameters (e.g., morphology, structure, size, brightness, oil adsorption and chemical purity) 

[63, 68]. These nanoparticles can enhance properties of the coating such as weather 

resistance, anti-corrosion, rheological properties and low abrasiveness [69, 70].  

Alkaline earth carbonates, namely calcium and magnesium carbonate, must be 

considered as leading candidates for deacidification of paper because of their chemical 

simplicity, relatively low cost, high brightness and suitability for use as paper fillers. However 

simple carbonates tend to be relatively insoluble in neutral water as well as in organic 

solvents, a factor that limits their manner of distribution on paper-based documents. 

Relatively pure calcium carbonate products, as all limestone and chalk, tend to buffer the pH 

in a more moderate range (7.5 to 8.5) in comparison with some precipitated CaCO3 products 

that may contain some residual calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) (pH&gt;9) [58].  



 

2 7  |  P a g e  

 

One of the most problematic issues for the use of CaCO3 is it hydrophilicity. Surface 

modification of this compound with hydrophobic species would lead to a great expansion in 

its applications [68, 71]. A way to solve this problem is to tailoring the surface properties of 

nanoparticles by using organic capping layers or chemically installing functionality on 

nanoparticles surfaces through organic synthesis [72].  

(ii)  Hydroxides  

Suspensions or dispersions of alkaline earth hydroxides are typically used to achieve an 

almost instantaneous neutralization of free H
+
 ions with water formation [56].  

Baty et al. [58] report that micro- and nano-particulate dispersions of calcium and 

magnesium hydroxides show evidence of cellulose breakdown when unaged paper is treated; 

these adverse effects were attributed to excessively high pH.  

Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) proved to be an excellent deacidifying agent. It excess is 

slowly converted into carbonate because once the particles are deposited in paper, ensuring a 

good physicochemical compatibility with the support, they have the theoretical ability of 

reacting with carbon dioxide from the air, forming calcium carbonate (alkaline buffer) in situ 

and without originate any undesirable side products [54, 56].  

(iii) Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles functionalization  

Surface functionalization is the process of modification the nanoparticles´ surfaces 

through the introduction of specific chemical functionalities. This process can, for example, 

efficiently promote the dispersion of particles in a solvent. Organic additives can be 

introduced to the crystallization process to modify the crystal surfaces and to control the 

particle nucleation and growth, too.  

Particularly, dodecanoic, or lauric, acid (DA) is a saturated fatty acid which is generally 

present in the form of a white powder and like many other fatty acids, is inexpensive and 

non-toxic, long shelf-life compound [73, 74].  

DA is used in the present work as a surface modifier. It changes the CaCO3 

nanoparticles from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and it is also used to control the particle size 

and shape. The Ca
2+

 ions react with the DA to form a hydrophobic salt Ca(C12H23O2)2. After a 

CO2 flow, the hydrophobic properties of the final calcium carbonate nanoparticles are 

attributed to the deposition of these salt molecules onto the CaCO3 surface [68, 71]. 

According to Sarkar [66, 75] dodecanoic acid used as an additive during the preparation of 

calcium carbonate, favours the formation of aragonite over calcite. Thus, the acid initiates the 

phase transformation from thermodynamically stable calcite to metastable aragonite phase.

Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles synthesis  

Despite of synthesis of nanoparticles is a simple process to carry out its thermodynamic 

tendency to agglomerate into bulk structures can be a problem. It is usually difficult to 

achieve the necessary high supersaturation degree for nucleation and the effect of co-ions at 

these concentrations can be critical. The effects of control parameters, such as reaction 

temperature, concentration of reacting species, and aging time of the nanostructure 

characteristics have been reported. Also, some studies report significant effects of organic 

solvents on the shape and size of the particles obtained by precipitation [63, 65]. 

There are two main different methods to synthesize nanomaterials, differentiated only 

by the starting material: top-down method - a material whose features are not in the 

nano-scale is worked to produce a nanostructure material; and bottom-up procedure - the 

nanostructures are built atom by atom from scratch. Different methods are very often 

combined to produce materials with the desired properties [56].  

In the present study the paper by Chen et al. [68] is followed in order to test the new 

route proposed by the authors. Here, a top-down method is used. It starts from a bulk material 

that is broken into small pieces using mechanical, chemical and/or other forms of energy 

(temperature). The drawback is the poor control of the nanoparticles dimensions, since the 

smallest size that can be produced by grinding is limited by the tendency to re-aggregate and 

particles below a few microns cannot usually be produced [63]. The contaminations of the 

particle surface by atmospheric gases and by materials used for the mill are others 

disadvantages [63]. In this case calcium oxide (CaO), mixed with water, is used to synthesize 

Ca(OH)2 (this reactions usually leads to a rather small amount of unreacted CaO) and then 

functionalized with dodecanoic acid (combination of steps (1) and (2) presented in the 

reactions below). After that and trough calcination with CO2 the remaining hydroxide is 

precipitated in CaCO3 (combination of (3) and (4) steps). By tuning the critical reaction 

parameters Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes can be produced. 

During this process the conversion of oxide particles to hydroxide is accompanied by a 

change in volume, which leads to a fragmentation of the particles and a reduction of their size. 

Finally, these particles can be effectively dispersed in a non-polar organic solvent (here, 

cyclohexane or nonane) trough ultrasound bath. In this particular the synthesis reaction is 

composed by four steps:

dispersion is removed from the flask to dry and characterize. This compound can be

 cations

chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid (Reactions 1.39 to 1.41): 

               Reaction 1.39 

           
      Reaction 1.40

(4) Finally the    
   anions react with the      ions in excess producing calcium 

carbonate (Reaction 1.42): 

   
               Reaction 1.42 

 

The hydrophobic properties of the final CaCO3 nanoparticles are attributed to the 

deposition of the resulted salt onto the calcium carbonate surface. Nucleation of calcite is 

induced by carboxylate functional groups. According to Chen et al. [68] this carbonation 

route can provide new insight into the industrialized production of CaCO3 with complex 

morphology.

2 TECHNIQUES  

Most of the archaeological objects, regardless their form or materials, are unique and 

most of the times cannot suffer sampling. Therefore the analytical methods/techniques applied 

to such samples should be non- or micro-destructive, preserving the integrity of the object. 

This is especially important when valuable antique artefacts are investigated or trace element 

analysis is required.  

2.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  

The general appearance of the corroded surface is of great importance not in order to 

establish a direct identification of the patina products, since this assumption may induce some 

evaluation mistakes but in order to observe typical corrosion areas such as “cauliflower” 

corrosion crust. In fact, this specific type of corrosion is considered to be a particular form of 

“black spot” and can be distinguish by its structure (cauliflower-looking like) that can grow in 

spots or cover wider areas, and colour, mostly brown/black [76, 77].  

2.2 Nanoparticles dispersions analysis  

To work with nanoparticles dispersions one of the most important points is the solvent 

choice. It should be selected based on the features of the porous materials under evaluation. 

Even more, the dispersing solvent can be use as pure or in a mixture in order to achieve the 

ideal penetration inside the artefact and the ideal rheological properties for the application 

purposes [63]. The best methods for paper deacidification are based on the use of 

non-aqueous solvents, once less polar fluids minimize the risk of ink solubilisation [65]. 

Moreover, since nanoparticles are stable in alcohols without the need for stabilizers that could 

leave residues on the treated artefacts, alcoholic hydroxide dispersions can be used for the 

neutralization of paper acidity, generating an alkaline reserve of carbonate that prevents 

further degradation, minimizing the risk of swelling and solubilisation of metal-gall inks, 

which may be lost by using aqueous treatment. Once delivered on the paper the nanoparticles 

are immediately available for the deacidification or buffering.  

In this case, the dispersions were made with non-polar organic solvents namely, 

cyclohexane or nonane, noticing that, the dispersions were not mixed and were directly 

sonicated. This ultrasonic treatment promotes the physical absorption of the organic reactant 

on the nanoparticles´ surface and yields to nanosized units that aggregate further into 

mass-fractal superstructures. The dispersions analysis is very important to understand how the 



 

3 2  |  P a g e  

 

modified hydrophobic particles behave in this type of solvents. The ideal dispersions should 

be stable in a time interval from 18 h to 24 h.  

2.3 Turbidimetry  

Turbidimetry is the process of measuring the turbidity (or cloudiness) by quantifying 

the degree of attenuation of a radiant beam which focuses on the particles suspended in a 

particle/solvent system. This measurement is made in the directly transmitted beam, i.e. upon 

the loss of intensity of transmitted light due to the scattering effect of particles caused by the 

finely divided suspended objects.  

(i) Equipment and measurements  

Figure 2.1 shows the instrumental design generally used on this technique. Here the 

light passes through a filter creating a light beam of known wavelength that passes through a 

cuvette containing the dispersion. In this procedure, the decrease in the radiation’s transmitted 

power is measured. If a beam of light is passed through a turbid sample its intensity is reduced 

by scattering and the quantity of scattered light is dependent upon the concentration and size 

distribution of the particles [78]. For instrumental measurement it is advisable to ensure that 

settling of the particles being measured will be negligible [78, 79]. In order to have consistent 

results variables must be carefully controlled, such as the used wavelength and extremely 

dilute suspensions may be measured [78].  

 

Figure 2.1 – Optical arrangements of turbidimetry [80]. 

Turbidimetric measurements permit analyze the amount of sediment in a liquid which 

makes the use of this technique particularly usefully on the assessment of precipitates formed 

by the interaction of very dilute solutions or other particulate matter [78]. As that turbidimetry 

is used in order to study the obtained CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 dispersed particles stability. This 

technique works as a technical consolidation of the visual analysis, being much more efficient 

and accurate, as would be expected, since it lowers, in large-scale, the human error.

2.4 Attenuated Total Reflectance  

Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) is a sampling technique used in conjunction with 

infrared (IR) spectroscopy enabling samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid 

state, with minimal preparation. This technique, typically performed within a few seconds, 

allows the obtainment of structural information from the surface and measurement of thin 

layers (surface characterization) [81, 82]. 

(i) Equipment and measurements  

ATR is based on the phenomenon of total internal reflection and measures the changes 

that occur in an internally reflected infrared beam that comes into contact with the sample 

through the ATR crystal (diamond, in this case). When a sample is placed in contact with the 

diamond the resulting evanescent wave is attenuated in the regions of the IR spectrum where 

the sample absorbs energy, being the powder directed placed on the sampling plate over the 

optic window (just enough amount to cover it (mm)) noticing that the sample thickness does 

not affect the intensity of the absorbance bands and it is in direct contact with the ATR crystal 

[81, 83, 84]. Figure 2.2 illustrates the ATR principle.  

 

Figure 2.2 – ATR principle. Internal reflections through an ATR crystal.  

Due the internal reflectance to the crystal only a fraction of light reaches into the 

sample. The penetration depth depends on the wavelength, the refractive indices ( ) of the 

ATR crystal and the sample (                    ) and the angle of the entering light beam 

(typically 45
o 

relative to the crystal surface) [81, 84, 85]. In regions of the IR spectrum where 

the sample absorbs energy the evanescent wave will be attenuated or altered by the sample 

and the reflected radiation is returned to the detector.  

Diamond is an ideal crystal material for routine measurements on a wide range of 

samples since it possesses extreme chemical and mechanical robustness and durability and it 

is chemically inert [81, 82, 84]. 

ATR provides excellent data quality combined with the highest reproducibility of any 

IR sampling technique. The improved spectral acquisition and reproducibility associated with 

this technique leads to better quality database building for more precise material verification

and identification. However, there are some potential drawbacks to using this technique, 

namely the cost of the optics and ATR element is relatively fragile and should be handled 

with care [81-85].  

In order to study the chemical nature of the CaCO3 (0.0% and 5.0% DA) powders 

samples were used ATR technique. This procedure provides an important idea about the 

reaction effectiveness, i.e. it allows analyzing the final product reaction in order to understand 

what it is constituted by.  

2.5 X-ray techniques  

X-ray analysis includes two main techniques. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry 

which is based on the measurement of the characteristic X-ray (XR) emission energies and 

works on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of elements with high atomic numbers 

(typically, Z&gt;13). On the other hand X-ray powder Diffraction (XRD) uses diffraction data 

obtained by the study of structure-dependent scattering phenomena. Here, the shapes and 

positions of diffraction peaks can be used to establish a wide range of physical properties, 

namely stress, texture, crystallinity and particle size and phase identification.  

2.5.1 X-ray Fluorescence  

X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) technique is governed by the photoelectric effect. According 

to this principle, a high energetic radiation is used to ionize the atoms present in a sample, 

inducing the ejection of an electron from its atomic position and creating a vacancy on a fully 

occupied inner shell. In order to the atom revert to its stable state two different processes may 

occur. In the first case a rearrangement of the atom may occur originating the emission of a 

second electron (Auger effect). While the second process is based on the transference of an 

electron from an outer electron to fill the free internal vacancy, emitting a photon and 

originating the X-ray fluorescence phenomenon (Figure 2.3). This process repeat and series 

of photons will be emitted until a free electron replaces an outermost valence spot so the atom 

returns to the ground state.

The kinetic energy of the emitted X-ray photon (Eph) depends and corresponds to the 

energy difference between the shell´s final (Ef) and initial (Ei) binding energies. Because this 

difference is characteristic for every element the excited atoms emit characteristic radiation 

(Figure 2.4).  

 

Figure 2.4 – X-ray emission lines, particularly K and L radiation and its respective notations according Siegbahn 

and IUPAC rules.  

Moreover the energy of X-ray lines depends on the atomic number of the emitting atom 

being this relation translated by the Henry Moseley’s law (Equation 2.1) [86, 87]:  

 

 
         

 
Equation 2.1 

where   is the wavelength of the characteristic emission to the atomic number Z and   and   

are constants values specific for the energy distribution levels and sublevels involved in a 

given transition. Note that K lines are generally more intense.  

The energy of Auger electrons (EAe) depend on the energy difference between the 

vacancy and the jumping level but also on the binding energy of the emitted electron. Both 

processes (emissions of X-ray photons and Auger electrons) are competing. As that their 

probability is complementary and the chance of Auger effect occur increases with a decrease 

in the difference between the energy states (highest for low Z elements) [86, 88].  

It is important to notice that X-rays have different interactions with the material, namely 

absorption and scattering.

Absorption occurs when the incoming radiation is absorbed in the sample and has to be 

considered as two different interactions. The first one is described by the Lambert-Beer law 

(Figure 2.5 and Equation 2.2) where I0 is the incident radiation and I is the transmitted one, 

noticing that the intensity is reduced by exponential function in dependence of mass 

absorption coefficient ?, thickness of the layer d and density ? on the sample [86, 89]. And 

secondly as the absorption of fluorescence radiation on the way to the sample surface, which 

describes the information depth of XRF and heat up the sample.  

 

 

Figure 2.5 – Absorption and dissipation (in all angles) of electromagnetic radiation.  

On the other hand, scattering results from the interaction of X-ray photons with the 

electrons of the target element, changing their direction and possibly loosing energy. Two 

main types of scattering take place in the photon-atom interaction: Compton (incoherent or 

inelastic) and Rayleigh (coherent or elastic) scattering. On Compton effect (Figure 2.6 (a)) 

the incoming photon is scattered on a weakly bonded electron that can take over a part its 

energy being the radiation characterized by a slightly lower energy compared to that from the 

incoming beam. In case of Rayleigh effect (Figure 2.6 (b)) no energy is lost in the collision 

process once it is a result of photons scattering on strongly bonded electrons. These electrons 

can only oscillate with the frequency of the incident photon. As no energy change is involved 

the Rayleigh radiation will retain exactly the same energy as the incident beam.  

 

Figure 2.6 – Compton (a) and Rayleigh (b) scattering effects.  

Because of these phenomena, in addition to the characteristic radiation of the elements 

present in the irradiated sample, the XRF spectrum presents peaks that correspond to a 

Compton and Rayleigh scatters of the incident beam. Even more, Rayleigh scatter peaks are

characterized by sharp shapes that correspond to the characteristic energies of the incident 

beam while Compton peaks are wider and located at slightly lower energies. Intensity of 

scattered is dependent on the average atomic number and on the density and the thickness of 

the sample being irradiated, as consequence light elements give rise to high Compton effects 

and low Rayleigh scatter [87, 90]. 

Due to its versatility XRF technique is widely used in chemistry, biology, forensic 

science, engineering, agriculture, clinical chemistry, cultural heritage and many other fields 

[89]. Some of its benefits and drawbacks are related with a low spectral background caused 

by scattered tube radiation and the relatively simple instrumentation; and the low spatial 

resolution originated by the impossibility for focusing the X-rays [86].  

Normally, XRF measurements are referred to bulk analysis [90]. However the two main 

points to consider in relation with the penetration depth are the depth of penetration of the 

primary X-ray beam into the sample and the escape depth from which fluorescent X-rays can 

be detected. Both of these are directly linked to the energy of the X-rays: the higher the X-ray 

energy the deeper the X-ray penetrates. Moreover, X-rays penetration depth can vary from 

micrometers down to several millimetres, depending on the sample matrix [91]. 

The lighter elements (e.g. Al, Si) have very low energy X-rays and thus will be difficult 

to detect even at relatively small depths within the sample. Heavier elements (e.g. Cu, Ag) 

have much more energetic X-rays which will be able to pass through large distances within 

the sample. So, heavy elements (i.e. energetic fluorescent XR) will be detectable relatively 

deep within a sample matrix primarily comprised of light elements (i.e. low absorption) and 

light elements will be detectable only at the surface of a sample matrix comprised of heavy 

elements [91].  

(i) Equipment  

In the present study a micro Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (?-EDXRF) 

spectrometer is used. This is an analytical method with sensitive elemental analysis of 

(non)homogeneous material that focus the incident radiation (by introducing appropriate 

focusing optics) to a much smaller size spot (µm/nm scale) on the sample [86, 87]. The 

equipment consists in two basic units: the excitation source and the spectrometer detection 

system. Here the detector can be very close to the sample so a high amount of fluorescence 

radiation can be captured [86]. The sample chamber operates under vacuum, which is a 

crucial condition in the determination of light elements.

Detector  

Detectors transform the emerging energy of the X-ray photons into electric pulses 

(counts) detecting both fluorescence radiation and scattering. A Silicon-Drift-Detector (SDD) 

is used in the present work. SDD are developed with a cylindrically symmetric structure that 

generates the electrical field for charge carrier collection, guiding the electrons through the 

detector and reducing the entrance capacity for the preamplifier, dropping the electronic noise 

in the detector and, consequently, reducing the filter which means that count rates can be 

enhanced guarantying very high count rates and good energy resolutions [86-88]. It is made in 

highly pure silicon with a very low leakage current [87].  

At this point it is important to define some main criteria for the detection system 

(detector plus amplifier and multichannel analyzer) evaluation. Resolution is the ability of the 

detector to distinguish between different photons with very close energies. It influences the 

selectivity of the methodology and is estimated by the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) 

[87, 88]. The detector efficiency is defined as the percentage of ionizing radiation reaching 

the detector (higher number of pulses, higher number of incoming photons, higher efficiency). 

It depends on the detector size and shape, the distance from it to the sample, the absorption of 

radiation before it reaches the detector and the backscatter radiation toward it [87]. Finally, 

sensitivity corresponds to the capability to produce a usable pulse for a given type of radiation 

and energy. This parameter depends on the detector cross-section and its volume, the detector 

window and the intrinsic detector noise [88].  

Additional peaks (spectrum artifacts) can arise in an XRF spectrum from sources other 

than the meaningful elements in the sample and due the photoelectric events that occur deep 

inside the detector. It is important to be aware of the nature of these events in order to get 

quality analytical results once they contribute to the full energy peak [87, 88]. For events 

which occur near the surface, there is a significant probability that the characteristic X-ray 

escapes and the corresponding amount of energy is lost from the signal. The atoms in a 

detector (Si, in this work) will also emit their own characteristic radiation when struck by the 

incoming X-ray beam. The majority of this radiation is immediately absorbed within the 

detector and not contributes to the overall charge collected [87]. The result of this escape 

process is an escape peak located at an energy value lower than the parent peak and 

equivalent to the difference between the energy of the original photon and the energy of the 

line of the detector element [87, 88]. These artifacts could be reduced by preventing the 

incident radiation from interacting in the periphery of the detector by means of collimation 

[88]. Other common spectral artifacts are sum peaks. They are the result of the high-intensity 



 

3 9  |  P a g e  

 

peaks that arrive to the detector so close together in time that the pileup inspector cannot 

recognize them as two events; therefore the energy of the resulting peak is the sum of the two 

initial energies and it effect is for the signals to be seen as only one [87, 88]. Finally, 

background artifact, which is mainly due to coherent and incoherent scattering, already 

exposed. It shape can be complex and depends on the initial shape of the excitation spectrum 

and on the sample composition as well as on the incomplete charge collection of intense 

fluorescence lines in the spectrum [88]. Figure 2.7 presents some spectrum artifacts detected 

on the present work, namely the copper escape peak, the Compton effect, as well as the 

characteristic signals from the equipment (Zr) and X-ray tube (Rayleigh scatter-Rh).  

 

Figure 2.7 – Spectrum artifacts and characteristic signals from the used equipment.  

X-ray tube  

In a X-ray tube a beam of emitted electrons, generated by heating up the spiral filament 

(cathode), are accelerated by a strong electric field against a target (anode) placed inside a 

vacuum housing [86-88]. The energy of the characteristic radiation of the XR tube is 

determined by the element from which the anode is made, while the continuous radiation 

depends on the applied voltage, the current and on the anode material used [87]. This process 

generates high energetic electromagnetic radiation: X-rays.  

X-ray tube windows are normally made of beryllium (Be) because of its high 

transmission for low energy XR, however Be is a poor conductor so if a window is too thin it 

can lead to fracture [88]. Even more, in a side-window tube the electrons hit the target with an 

angle that is different to 90º and the distance from target to window has to be relatively large 

to avoid the heating of the window [86, 88].

Optics  

Concerning cultural heritage related objects X-ray optics devices are a great 

improvement as it resolves tiny details both lateral and in depth [90]. With these devices it 

should be possible to change the direction and/or the energetic distribution of the radiation 

[86]. However, its application is limited when elements with very low concentrations present 

in a sample have to be determined [87].  

The use of capillary lens shape and direct the primary X-ray beam that impinges on the 

lens´ surface and propagates thorough the system, emerging in a convergent beam with high 

intensity [87]. Particularly, polycapillary systems, prepared from bundles of very thin single 

capillaries (inner diameter of 1–2 ?m), are used in order to obtain a larger intensity gain 

within the focal spot [86, 87].  

(ii) Qualitative and quantitative analysis 

Spectra resulting from this technique allow analytical information about the sample in 

order to ascertain the elements present in the target sample (qualitative analysis) and/or their 

content quantification (quantitative analysis).  

The position of the characteristic X-ray emitted energies on the spectrum determines the 

elements present in the sample. In order to get meaningful and qualitative quality analytical 

results it is important to take into account all the spectrum characteristics and artifacts [87].  

Quantitative XRF analysis takes into account the heights of the peaks once they are 

related to the element concentrations. This evaluation involves both the conversion of the net 

analytical signs to the analytes concentrations as well as the elements peaks correction for the 

spectral background and possible overlaps by background correction and deconvolution, 

respectively. Quantitative analysis when using ?-EDXRF generates relatively large errors. As 

that these results should be considered as semi-quantitative. The resulting information about 

the elements content in the sample is relative and indicative, so extra care is important for the 

data treatment.  

Statistical treatment on the analytical results is necessary since the heterogeneities and 

the modifications of the corrosive conditions can led to variation in the composition of the 

corrosion products. This topic will be further discussed on Chapter 4.  

(iii) Measurements  

?-EDXRF is used in order to investigate the coins elemental constitution 

semi-quantifying the elements that constitute its surface and bulk. Based on historical 

information the possibility of the studied coins had been silver enriched need to be 



 

4 1  |  P a g e  

 

investigated. As that is important to notice that regardless the origin of silver enrichment, the 

enriched layer plays a decisive role in the ?-EDXRF analysis results. If the thickness of 

enriched layers is greater than the depth under study only the composition of this layer is 

accessible [33]. Moreover, when the surface silver content is several times higher with respect 

to the amount of the bulk, this result suggests that the coin had been intentionally silver 

surface enriched. Even though, the major problem in analysing antique plated coins is 

whether it is possible to indisputably distinguish intentional silvering from the phenomenon of 

surface enrichment resulting from long-term selective corrosion.  

2.5.2 X-ray Diffraction  

A crystal can be defined as a homogeneous and anisotropic body, having the natural 

shape of a polyhedron and where a typical 3D regular arrangement of atoms represented by 

the smallest repeating unit showing the full symmetry of the crystal structure (unit cell) can be 

seen. Lattice planes are defined from shape and dimensions of the unit cell. These planes are 

imaginary and provide a reference grid to which the atoms in the crystal structure may be 

referred [92, 93].  

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis is a versatile technique for examining, identify and 

characterize almost any crystalline material, whether inorganic or organic through the use of 

X-rays [92, 94]. Since every ordered material is made up of a unique arrangement and number 

of atoms it will give a diffraction pattern that is, to all intents and purposes, also unique [92]. 

This fact introduces the concept of finger printing on X-ray Diffraction analysis, one of the 

most important ones on the identification of unknown materials.  

The operative equation in XRD is the Bragg equation (Equation 2.3):  

            Equation 2.3 

where n is the order of a reflection,   the wavelength, d the distance between parallel lattice 

planes and   the angle between the incident beam and the lattice plane, known as the Bragg 

angle.         represents the path length in the crystal. When its value is a multiple of the 

wavelength constructive interference occurs and diffracted intensity is obtained [94]. Bragg´s 

Law is represented in Figure 2.8. 



 

4 2  |  P a g e  

 

 

Figure 2.8 – Illustration of Bragg´s Law [94].  

The two basic parameters being used in this search/match process are the d values, 

calculated from the measured 2  values in the diffractogram, and the relative intensities of the 

lines in the pattern. d-spacing is a function of the lattice parameters (a,b,c) and angles (?,?,?) 

that define the unit cell; and the Miller indices (h,k,l) denoting a particular reflection. Each 

family plans is separated by a specific d gap whose value allows identifying a particular and 

unique plan, so the main structure has a characteristic set of interplanar distances d. As such, 

it is the geometry of the crystal lattice that determines the positions of the peaks in its 

diffraction pattern. In general, the more symmetrical the material, the fewer peaks in its 

diffraction pattern [94]. X-ray diffraction is thus capable of providing general purpose 

qualitative and quantitative information on the presence of phases (e.g., compounds) in an 

unknown mixture [92].  

(i) Equipment and measurements  

Powder diffractometer systems have a geometric arrangement (Figure 2.9) known as 

the Bragg–Brentano parafocusing system and is typified by a diverging beam from a line 

source F (X-ray source), falling onto the specimen S, which is diffracted and passes through a 

receiving slit R, to the detector, passing along a two-circle goniometer (A). Distances FA and 

AR are equal. The amount of divergence is determined by the effective focal width of the 

source and the aperture of the divergence slit D. The equipment control and data collect and 

analysis are made on a computer [92, 94].  

 

Figure 2.9 – Geometry of the Bragg–Brentano diffractometer [92].  

Legend: F-source; P and PR-Soller slits; S-sample; D- divergence slit; R- receiving slit. The axis of the goniometer 

is at A. 



 

4 3  |  P a g e  

 

By synchronizing the scanning speed of the goniometer with the recorder diffractogram 

(a plot of 2   intensity vs degrees) is obtained. The goniometer can be used in two different 

configurations:  /2   (sample stage vs detector) or  /   (tube vs detector). Moreover, this 

device may be oriented to keep the sample horizontal or vertical [94]. A diffracted beam 

monochromator may also be used in order to improve signal-to-noise characteristics. Finally, 

in Crooks tube a tungsten wire exerts pressure on the poles increasing the pressure between 

the cathode and the anode and releasing a cathode ray beam that collides with the metal target.  

A large data base (either computed or in paper) of pure single-phase materials is 

normally available so that rapid empirical file-searching techniques can be employed for 

measuring phases (compounds) [92, 94]. The diffractogram is reduced to a list of d-spacing’s 

and intensity values and then submitted for file search/matching [92]. 

With relation to the set of studied coins this technique is used in order to identify 

crystalline unknown compounds. In this case, the work is particularly complex and prolonged 

due to the lack of information about the patina constituents’ compounds. Even more, being 

completed unknown the coins origin. The application of this technique to 0.0% and 5.0% DA 

CaCO3 powders works in the opposite way. XRD is used, on this case, in order to examine the 

components crystal structure allowing identifying the presence of crystalline compounds and 

their phases. Here XRD is used to confirm the already known compounds that are present in 

the powders.  

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy 

The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) sweeps the solid surface, according to the 

operator command, with a focused high energy electron beam that interacts with atoms on the 

sample surface producing various signals that can be detected and which are translated into 

2D images of the object showing its spatial properties variations [95]. The signals that derive 

from electron-sample interactions reveal information about the morphology (texture and 

topographical) and chemical composition (in microanalysis detail) [96, 97] of the object. This 

approach is especially useful in qualitatively or semi-quantitatively analyses. Even more, 

SEM technique reveals levels of detail and complexity inaccessible by light microscopy and it 

creates precise measurements of very small features and objects down to 50 nm [96, 97]. 

SEM is routinely used to generate high-resolution images of shapes on objects and to 

show spatial variations in chemical compositions acquiring elemental maps or spot chemical 

analyses when coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). 



 

4 4  |  P a g e  

 

(i) Equipment and measurements  

Figure 2.10 shows the SEM inside structure. It comprises an electron generating 

component (gun) fitted, generally, with a tungsten filament cathode at the top; a column down 

which the electron beam travels; a series of lenses to shape the electron beam; the sample 

chamber at the base; a series of pumps to keep the system under vacuum; a computer that 

drives the microscope, with the additional bench controls; and an ancillary equipment to, for 

example, composition analyses [97]. This device runs on all axes allowing analyzing the 

sample in any perspective [95]. Note that EDS detectors cannot detect very light elements 

(e.g. H or Li). 

 

Figure 2.10 – Schematic figure on Scanning Electron Microscopy [98]. 

Sample preparation can be minimal depending on the nature of the samples and the data 

required. However, the objects must be solid, fit into the microscope chamber and stable in a 

vacuum.  

This technique is used on both surface samples, i.e. for the evaluation on the 

conservation state of the antique Portuguese dinheiros as well as in the nanoparticles´ 

characterization for cultural heritage conservation, in the same way. On coins, the SEM/EDS 

is applied in order to study their corroded surface allowing to evaluate the degradation 

phenomena extent and punctually quantifying the elemental composition in several specific 

spots. In the 0.0% and 5.0% DA CaCO3 synthesized powders the goal is to analyze their 

surfaces, identifying the morphology changes and realize the size (nano or not) of the 

particles.

3 EXPERIMENTAL PART 

A set of six dinheiros dated from the first Portuguese dynasty (13
rd

 and 14
th 

centuries) 

were chosen to be analyzed by means of ?-EDXRF, XRD and SEM/EDS.  

3.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  

From the historical point of view coins are classified in different series based on their 

numismatic characteristics. Table 4.1 presents the set of the studied dinheiros. In order to 

simplify the data analysis, notation composed by the coin catalogue number followed by the 

letters O (obverse) and R (reverse) when both faces need to be discriminated was used.  

3.2 ?-Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence  

In order to proceed the X-ray Fluorescence elemental measurements a high performance 

micro-Energy Dispersive X ray Fluorescence (µ-EDXRF) spectrometer M4 Tornado from 

Bruker was used. The X-ray tube is a micro-focus side window Rh tube powered by a low 

power high voltage generator and cooled by air. A polycapillary is used to obtain a spot size 

down to 25 µm for Mo-K?. The X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and 600 µA and a 

composition of filters was used to reduce background (100 µm Al/ 50 µm Ti/ 25 µm Cu). 

Detection of fluorescence radiation is performed by energy dispersive Silicon-Drift-Detector 

with 30 mm² sensitive area and energy resolution of 142 eV for Mn-K?. Measurements were 

carried out under 20 mbar vacuum conditions and performed directly on the samples. Spectra 

deconvolution, fitting and quantification were performed using the in-built ESPIRIT software.  

The Limits of Detection were calculated by the use of the Certificate Reference Material 

(CRM) 32X SN7 (batch A) (MBH
 
Analytical Ltd). A disc ~40 mm diameter in bronze (chill 

cast) manufactured by Polycast Ltd. The spectra deconvolution and fitting were performed 

using WinAXIL software package.  

3.3 X-ray Diffraction  

Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used in order to characterize the nature of the 

patina films on the coins surface. The procedure was carried out with a Panalytical X'pert Pro 

diffractometer (    ) equipped with X’Celerator detector and with automatic data acquisition 

(X’Pert Data Collector (v2.0b) software). The patterns were collected using unfiltered Cu-K? 

radiation, 40 kV–30 mA, and the Bragg?Brentano geometry over the    range 10?90° with a 

  -step size of 0.017º and a scan step time of 20 s. The structural characterization of the

samples was made according JCPDS/ICCD (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standard 

Data/International Centre for Diffraction Data) database.  

3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy  

The morphology and elemental composition were investigated by Field Emission Gun 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG SEM) JEOL 7001F coupled to Oxford light elements 

EDS detector and EBSD detector. For the collection of micrographs the electron gun was 

operated at 25 kV accelerating voltage.

4 RESULTS PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION 

In order to proceed the evaluation on the conservation state and the determination of the 

patina constituents and propose a possibly corrosion mechanism in the system alloy/interface 

several techniques were used, namely ?-EDXRF, XRD and SEM/EDS. The present chapter 

presents a complete discussion of the obtained results.  

4.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  

The examination on the surface of the coins helps understanding the composition of the 

substrate and its patina compounds. However it does not allows to assume their composition 

but, on a general point of view, could be an useful criteria in order to be aware of the coin 

history. 

The general appearance of the coins and the main observations on each face is described 

on Table 4.1.  

It could be concluded that all the coins were well preserved taking into account their 

dating period (13
rd

 and 14
th

 centuries). The only exceptions were on 257 R, 283 R and 500 R, 

particularly, 275 R which presents a typical and local “cauliflower” corrosion area.  

Generally, well defined surfaces with black-brownish coloration were observed in all 

the coins. Moreover, coins numbered 280, 257 and 283 showed a copper like coloration on 

some high relief areas.  

A yellow-brownish colour on low relief areas was observed on 275, 279, 280 and 500 

coins. A locally green coloration on 279 coin (low relief region) and a red-brownish colour on 

257 (covering the surface) has been observed.

Based on this data it can be concluded that the numisms have similar diameters 

and slightly different weights.  

4.2 ?-Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence  

Micro Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (µ-EDXRF) spectrometry was used 

in order to investigate the elemental composition on the coins (bulk and surface).  

It is important to highlight some ideas before presenting the results. The beam 

penetration depth is dependent on the sample matrix – heavier elements have more 

energetic X-rays, which will be able to pass through large distances within the sample 

and hence can be produced deeper inside the bulk. On the other hand, if a coin has a 

very thick patina layer the incident radiation has to cross this coating before the bulk. In 

any case, elements Z&gt;13, such as carbon and oxygen, are undetectable by XRF 

technique.  

Figure 4.1 presents the obtained results (element identification and copper 

quantification) when two points on the same coin, particularly 283 coin, where 

compared. The point’s choice was based on its visual similar characteristics, i.e. the 

position on the coin, high relief and presented colours (both identified by the white 

circles on the figure).

Figure 4.1 – µ-EDXRF spectra and images obtained on 283 coin for pt.1 (blue line) and pt.2 (red line). 

Copper quantification on both points.  

Based on these results it can be concluded that iron (Fe), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), 

bismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), antimony (Sb) and copper (Cu) were identified on both 

spectra. Furthermore, the similarity on the copper content on both points 

(Cu &gt; 96 wt.%) is clear.  

In fact, the main differences between both spectra were the peaks significance for 

the light elements, such as silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), chlorine (Cl), 

calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). These variations are particularly important since it 

allows to demonstrate the differences between the presence, or not, of exogenous 

elements on the analysis. Si, P, S, Cl, Ca and Sr were present on the coin surface due 

environmental contamination or as corrosion products, being part of the patina layer and 

not as constituents of the alloy. This topic will be further discussed. In consequence, it 

can be assumed that pt.2 (red line) should be mostly representative of the alloy once the 

presence of these contaminants is lower, regarding the obtained spectra.

These results represent the main criterion chosen for the following discussion. As 

consequence of the proved existence of these “contaminants” on the coin surface, the 

spectra representing the remaining studied coins were chosen based on its elemental 

quantifications in order to reduce, as much as possible, the presence of elements such as 

Si, P, S, Cl, Ca or Sr. This choice allowed to present, in the best way possible, the bulk 

constitutions.  

The obtained quantifications should be taken carefully, as previously exposed. 

Parameters such as the standard deviation and the relative standard deviation (RSD) as 

well as the Limit of Detection (LOD) are very important is the method and results 

evaluation. Annexe II presents the detailed information and formulas in order to 

accomplish the data treatment according to the literature [87, 99-102].  

4.2.1 Limit of Detection  

The signal at the Limit of Detection (LOD) is derived from the smallest measure 

that can be detected with reasonable certainty for a given analytical procedure. The 

value of LOD, for µ-EDXRF is given by the Equation 4.1 [87, 99]:  

    
      

  
 

 
Equation 4.1 

where    is the concentration of the element i and    and    are the counting rates for 

the background and for the peak, respectively.  

In practice, the limit of detection represents the level below which cannot be 

confident whether or not the element is actually present. It follows from this that no 

analytical method can ever conclusively prove that a particular chemical substance is 

not present in a sample, only whether it cannot be detected [100]. LOD is better when 

the background is less, the instrumental sensitivity increases, and through longer 

counting times [87].  

Table 4.3 presents the calculated LOD´s by the measure of the CRM 32X SN7.

4.2.2 Coins analysis  

Since the elemental quantification on each point varies with the number of 

elements detected and selected on each spectrum, the final error on the results takes this 

into account. On practice, these errors can be minimized by reporting the mean value of 

the quantifications however they can be assumed only as representative of the total 

content of each element.  

The individual µ-EDXRF spectra and elemental quantification for each one of the 

studied dinheiros are present on Figures A.III.1 to A.III.6 and Tables A.III.1 to 

A.III.6 on Annexe A.III.1. The complete chemical composition of the patina layer and 

of the bulk metal of the samples and the respective statistical treatment is presented on 

Table A.III.7 on the same Annexe.  

Several elements were identified and quantified as constituents of the studied 

dinheiros, being part of its billon alloy or as patina constituents. The obtained results 

showed that copper was the main component in the all of them, followed by silver and 

some minor elements, namely Si (non-detected only on sample 257), Fe, Pb, Sb, As, Ca, 

P, Cl, S and K (all with contents &gt; 0.11 wt.%), bismuth (Bi), gold (Au), mercury (Hg), 

titanium (Ti) and Sr (contents &amp;lt;0.09 wt.%) when detected. However Ag is a 

particularly case of study.  

Table 4.4 presents a resume on the copper and silver contents. These are the main 

elements under study once, historically, the set coins should be made on billon alloy – 

copper/silver.

In order to facilitate these relationships the graphs below were made (Figure 4.2):  

 

Figure 4.2 –Copper and silver contents (wt.%) (a) and silver contents (wt.%) (b) variations on the studied 

set of dinheiros.  

Based on these data it can be concluded that copper content was practically 

invariable (always Cu &gt; 81.0 wt.%). On the other hand, the silver content had a different 

behaviour. As a result two different groups of coins, regarding this element 

quantification could be established: the first group (G1) constituted by coins with the 

catalogue numbers 275, 279, 280 and 257, with high contents of Ag varying from 

11.0 wt.% to 7.0 wt.%; and a second one (G2) which the coins numbered 283 and 500 

(dated from D. Fernando I reign) belonged. G2 presented a silver content that varied 

between 0.3 wt.% to 0.1 wt.%.  

According to these results it can be assigned that even though G1 and G2 were 

constituted by a similar billon alloy, the coins from D. Fernando I period of reign were 

weakened. These results are in accordance with the historical information at that date. 

The economical situation of the country was well demonstrated by the fact that the 

silver content between 0.24 wt.% and 0.25 wt.% did not corresponded to the legal one: 

2.78 wt.% [12]. These coins are composed by a billon alloy with a low content in silver.  

The presented results were compared with the ones obtained by Guerra et al. [12]. 

These authors concluded that during the first dynasty, the average fineness corresponds 

to the legal one from D. Afonso Henriques to D. Pedro I. However, for D. Fernando I 

they registered exactly the same behaviour. Table 4.5 compares the legal values and the 

results from Guerra et al. [12] with the data collected in the present work.

In most cases, with time, the devaluation of the alloy corresponded to the 

replacement of the noble metal by a less expensive one [12].

dinheiros according to the groups that they represent. Figure 4.3 shows G1 composed

Figure 4.4 - µ-EDXRF spectrums and images obtained on G2 (283 and 500).  

On both groups the main identified elements were arsenic, antimony, lead, 

bismuth and, the most intense peak in all spectra, copper. Silver was also identified, but 

it is important to notice the difference in the intensity and the number of lines presented 

in both cases. The coins with less silver contents had fewer and less intense Ag peaks.  

Based on the provenance and manufacturing chapters presented on this work 

some relationships can be proposed. Detected elements as Si, Cl, Ca, P and possibly K, 

Fe and Hg are present on this evaluation as contamination from the surrounding 

environment.  

Cu, Ag, Bi and Au and possible Sb, Pb and Fe can be present as part of the ore, 

i.e. they are result of the ore provenance or, in the 3 last cases due to provenance or 

technology. The presence of lead can be, in fact, justified by the use of this element in 

order to achieve a better "fluidity" of copper and decrease the melting point of the metal 

during the manufacturing process of the coin [13]. The lead distribution can be strongly 

influenced by the cooling rate of the initial melting of the copper alloy. Indeed, this 

element is not substantially soluble on Cu so it is normally dispersed in the metallic

matrix [13]. The minor elements concentrations can be governed by ore 

mineralogy/composition or related to the smelting process. 

Based on the date period of the coins (13
rd

 and 14
th

 centuries) As is probably 

present due to ore provenance or the technology methodologies used on the coins 

manufacturing; while S, Ti, and Sr can be present as a result of technology processes.  

Anyway this should be a careful analysis since elements as silver, copper, lead 

and gold can be interpreted by casting irregularities, corrosion or by the process of 

chemical cleaning or enrichment/dilution. Even more, thermal and/or mechanical 

treatments can also induced changes in alloy composition.  

4.3 X-ray Diffraction  

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was used in order to identify the crystalline 

patina products formed on the surface of the coins.

The obtained X-ray diffractograms identified: natives copper (Cu), silver (Ag) and 

lead (Pb); cuprite (Cu2O), tenorite (CuO), malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2), nantokite (CuCl), 

atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3); chlorargyrite (AgCl) in the coins where high silver contents 

were present; and calcite (CaCO3) and quartz (SiO2), as the major crystalline products 

present on the studied set of coins. The peak identification was done according the 

JCPDS/ICCD database: 4-0836 (Cu); 4-0783 (Ag); 4-686 (Pb); 5-586 (CaCO3, calcite); 

5-288 (CuO); 5-0667 (Cu2O); 6-0344 (CuCl); 10-399 (Cu2CO3(OH)2); 25-269

Some important conclusions could be taken from the information exposed above.  

Native copper (Cu) was identified in all coins. Even more, this element which 

presents a cubic crystal system was the most intense peak on the coin with the catalogue 

number 500. Moreover, cuprite (Cu2O) (that also presents a cubic symmetry) was 

present in all coins and it was the most intense peak for all the remaining dinheiros. In 

fact, from the analysis of the total set of obtained patterns it was possible to conclude 

that cuprite is the major product on the samples. This is the first patina compound that is 

formed over time.  

Other typical crystalline copper corrosion products were indentified. Tenorite 

(CuO) on 275, 279, 257, 283 and 500 coins and malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) on 275 and 

279, both with a monoclinic symmetry. Nantokite (CuCl) on coins with the catalogue 

numbers 279, 280 and 283 and atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) on 280 were also recognized. 

These two last compounds present cubic and orthorhombic crystal symmetries, 

respectively.

Chlorargyrite, a cubic crystal system of AgCl, was identified on the coins with 

high silver contents (quantified by ?-EDXRF) and where native silver (identified by 

XRD) were present, namely on 275, 279, 280 and 257 (G1) coins. Native silver (cubic 

symmetry) or its degradation products are not present on the coins dated from of 

D. Fernando I kingdom (G2).  

On coin with the catalogue number 283 was also identified native lead (Pb).  

Finally, quartz (SiO2 – hexagonal symmetry) in all coins expect 500 and calcite 

(CaCO3 - rhombohedral crystal system) on this dinheiro were identified too.  

A final note to the fact that no specific support was used in the patterns 

acquisition. The coins were directly placed under the sample holder to be analyzed.  

 

Patina compounds vs environment:  

To propose a supported and detailed corrosion mechanism it would be very 

important the knowledge of the coins provenance as well as a detailed study of the soils 

or walls where these objects were found. However this information is absolutely 

unknown for the studied set of dinheiros. As a result, it is only possible to try to 

establish a possible relationship between the patina constituents and its probable 

surrounding environment. 

Based on patina evolution along time and environment (summarized on Figure 

4.6) a relationship between copper and its corrosion products can be notice. In fact, it 

seems like that what happened in practice is the interconversion of cuprite according the 

different reactions between Cu2O and the environment, originating various patina 

products: firstly, tenorite and nantokite and then malachite and atacamite. Even more, 

Cu2O presence may indicate not so aggressive coins´ environmental exposure or a 

possible cleaning once this inner layer is identified as the main patina compound in all 

coins.

Figure 4.6 – Main compounds found on patina layers of the studied coins. Possible patina evolution with 

time and environment of exposure and its possible formation reactions.  

According to the crystalline identified compounds it is possible that the coins had 

been in contact with chlorine and/or carbonate rich environments. The presence of 

chloride compounds on the coins surface, namely nantokite or atacamite can be due to 

marine proximity.  

In this Cl
-
 rich environment silver corrosion products can be formed on copper 

enriched areas, namely the observed chlorargyrite, particularly induced by oxygen and 

humidity:  

                        Reaction 1.17  

This was the only silver crystalline corrosion product identified.  

Finally, the identification of quartz and calcite may be related with some 

crystalline impurities presence on the surface of the coins.  

As consequence of the so far results, a general stratification scheme on the 

interactions between the metallic surface, its patina components and the surrounding 

marine environment can be suggest (Figure 4.7):

4.3.2 Coin 275: a particularly case of study  

Coin with the catalogue number 275 was a particularly case of study once it was 

the only dinheiro with visibly damaged surface. Figure 4.8 presents the XRD patterns 

obtained on this sample on both obverse and reverse faces, particularly, was tried to 

accomplish the measurements on the visibly corroded area (“cauliflower” denoted by 

R2) and the on rest of the coin reverse (denoted by R1).  

 

Figure 4.8– Powder XRD patterns obtained for 275 coin on both obverse (blue line denoted by 275 O) and 

reverse faces, particularly, the visibly corroded area (“cauliflower” – red line denoted by 275 R2) and the 

rest of the coin reverse (green line denoted by 275 R1).  

Legend: M-malachite; Q-quartz ; SC-chlorargyrite; T-tenorite; CP-cuprite.  

The analysis of this coin deserved special care taking into consideration the lack 

of precision in the coin position for the analysis. It was tried to investigate these specific 

areas however is not safeguarded the precision on the exact placement of the coin under 

analysis.  

Based on these results it can be concluded that the main difference between both 

“cauliflower” area and the rest of the coin surface were the most intense peaks and the 

tenorite and malachite identifications. Cuprite was the most intense peak on 275 O and 

275 R1 diffractograms while silver corresponded to the 100 % peak on this particularly 

corroded surface (275 R2). Apart from this difference no other significant distinctions 

were noted.

4.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy  

Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) was used with the view to characterize and identify the 

morphology and the chemical element distribution along the dinheiros surface, helping 

to understand the corrosion mechanism and the patinas constituents.  

4.4.1 Surface analysis  

More or less corroded the total set of the studied dinheiros were almost 

completely coated with a smooth and in the low relief areas a dense patina layer. On the 

high relief areas this layer revealed the metallic core mixed with possible patina oxides, 

chlorides and/or carbonates. This uplayer should be a protective coating patina since 

almost all the coins looked, on a macroscopic scale, well preserved. Furthermore, it was 

also clear the presence of silver and its corrosion products denoting the possible 

presence of silver surface enrichment.  

However, on a micro and nanometre scale some typical corrosion signs could be 

observed. Figure 4.9 presents some SEM images on the surface of five of the studied 

coins:  



 

6 5  |  P a g e  

 

 

Figure 4.9 – SEM images on the surface of five of the studied coins.  

Typical corroded fractures and fissures along the surface could be seen, mainly on 

275 and 280 coins (compatible with ?-EDXRF and XRD results). The brittle behaviour 

on billon alloys is not uncommon. Here, several perpendicular and parallel cracks were 

observed. These fissures caused probably by hydration and dehydration of the corrosion 

components are served as a starting point for a localized corrosion. They may also result 

from changes in volume resulting from corrosion. The conversion of nantokite into 

atacamite is followed through volume expansion (sample 280) which favours the 

transfer of elements from the environment to the coin surface, promoting its 

intergranular corrosion. Moreover, silver corrosion products are extremely aggressive. 

Among others they may have been one of the causes of 275 coin fissures.  

Some black cavities could be identified too (mainly on coins 279 and 283). They 

may had caused leaching and diffusion of copper during the corrosion process.

Meanwhile, SEM images of the uplayer (Figure 4.10) indicate a compact surface 

on 279(a) and 257 coins and a porous morphology on 275, 279(b), 283 and 500 

samples.

279(b), 283 and 500) patina layers.  

Note the white flakes on the above figures (4.9 and 4.10). These “clouds” should 

be loosely adherent corrosion products and are generally associated with high 

deposition rate of chlorides.  

4.4.1.1 Identified phases  

By the use of SEM/EDS two main phases were identified: copper/copper oxides 

(in all samples) and silver/silver chloride (on G1
8
 dinheiros). Moreover, other 

particularly morphologies were also identified, namely Si, Ca and Pb rich phases. 

SEM/EDS results can be seen in detail on Annexe A.III.3 (Figures A.III.12 to 

A.III.24).  

Figure 4.11 presents some examples of the identified copper and copper oxides 

phases:

Figure 4.11 – SEM/EDS copper phase examples obtained for 275, 279, 283 and 500.  

Mainly copper and oxygen (O) were quantified on a relative ratio of 

approximately 2:1. Once the metal is the main alloy constituent the presence of O can 

be related with the patina compounds. Moreover, as cuprite was the main crystalline 

corrosion product identified by XRD it can be concluded that this Cu rich phase is 

mainly constituted by Cu, Cu2O or even CuO. However, it should be noticed that not 

only Cu was identified on these spots. Also Si and Cl (both on site (4) and the last one 

on site (5)) were detected and quantified in contents lower than3.21 wt.%.  

Many of this copper rich areas are surrounded by another phases. For example, 

Figure 4.12 presents the identified copper (1) and silver (2) morphologies on coin 257. 

Owing the presence of chloride it can be assumed that both phases can be constituted by 

metallic Ag/AgCl and in fewer amounts by metallic Cu/CuCl compounds. Even more, it 

cannot be ignored the existence of other non-crystalline corrosion products, such as 

copper or silver oxides, sulphides, etc.

Figure 4.12 – SEM/EDS copper (1) and silver (2) phases obtained for 257. 

Silver phase was identified on 275, 279, 280 and 257 coins. These results are in 

concordance with the ones obtained by ?-EDXRF and XRD. Even more, the presence 

of significantly silver contents on large areas on the coins represents a normal behaviour 

in the Cu/Ag alloy due to the low solubility of silver on copper, and vice versa, at room 

temperature. During the cooling system, each component is separated in a pure state. 

Thus formed Ag enriched areas dispersed in the copper matrix, whose size will be 

dependent on the cooling rate [14]. However, the manufacture of coins can also promote 

macroscopic or microscopic segregations.  

At this point it is important to notice that these two different phases (Cu and Ag) 

can be characterized by very different morphologies. The observed dark areas were 

copper typical accidence; while silver phases were identified as bright areas with 

“cluster” organization. On the other hand, copper/copper oxides were presented on 

dense, plain or cuboid, arrangements.

and Fe (all in 280). As SEM/EDS is a surface technique it can be concluded that these 

are exogenous elements and were present on the coins surface due to environmental 

contamination, particularly, during patina formation or even dust incrusting the 

corrosion products [17]. Once again, these results are in concordance with the ones 

obtained by ?-EDXRF.

Both silicon (Figure 4.14 – (1), (2), (3)) and calcium (Figure 4.15 - (1), (2)) are 

exogenous elements constituents of patina. As proposed before their presence should be 

related with surrounding environment contamination. Even more, as can be seen on the 

coin with the catalogue number 500 (Figure 4.15 – 1 mm scale) the major impurity 

contents are located on the low relief areas. These regions generally looked like white 

shiny areas on SEM images. This happens because they form generally light and loosely 

compounds.  

 

? Lead (Figure 4.16):  

 

Figure 4.16 – SEM/EDS copper and lead phases obtained for 283. 

The morphological details and the surface chemical composition of the patina 

disclose an interesting feature of the presence of lead. This element usually originates 

cracks and selective corrosion Pb islands which extend deeply in the metal surface, as 

can be seen on Figure 4.16 (2). Note that 283 was the coin with higher content of lead 

by ?-EDXRF and the only one where crystalline Pb was identified by XRD. Pb 

presence is generally related to its very low solubility in copper and its low melting 

temperature with respect to that of the copper matrix as exposed already exposed on the 

?-EDXRF data treatment.  

In conclusion the results indicated that the dinheiros surface is characterized by a 

copper/copper oxide dense and plane layer. An external thin region where an 

appreciable silver/silver chloride/oxide enrichment was observed on a copper core 

characterized by a low Pb content (279, 280, 283) and a small amount of other minor 

elements such as Si, Ca, Al, Mg, P, S, K, Br, Fe, Sb, Sn.

4.4.2 Scraped edges  

In order to investigate the coins edges SEM/EDS measurements were made. Here 

different treatments and samples were analyzed, namely, the non-scarped edges of 257 

(constituted by Cu/Ag alloy) and 500 (mainly Cu) coins; and the manual scarped edge 

of 257 coin. Table 4.7 present the obtained results. Moreover, Annexe A.III.3 (Figures 

A.III.25 to A.III.27) shows the detailed SEM/EDS results.

Based on this information it can be concluded that any linear conclusion can be 

assumed.  

On 257 sample the copper content on both non-scraped (a) and scraped edge (b) 

increases from the upper (1) to the lower (3) edge of the coin, having Ag the opposite 

behaviour, i.e. silver content decreases “down” in the currency (from (1) to (3) sites) 

after cleaning (b). Note that no silver content was detected on the sample with the

non-scraped edge. (a). It is important to notice that copper content decreases 

(approximately 20 %) when the edge is scraped.  

On the other hand, on 500 non-scraped edge (c) the copper content decreases from 

the upper (1) to the lower (5) edge of the coin. Here, oxygen was detected in all the 

analyzed sites and “down” in the coin, nickel content increased from (3) to (5). 

Regarding to oxygen, is important to notice that on the first point only Cu and O were 

detected, this may justify the Cu2O or CuO presence.  

An examination of the coins cross-section would be very helpful in the 

determination of the exact composition of the substrate however conservators hesitate to 

remove the corrosion layer (once it could be a protective one) or damage the original 

piece.

5 CONCLUSIONS  

The combined action of non-destructive analytical techniques of ?-EDXRF, XRD 

and SEM/EDS allowed interpreting the nature of patina products formed on the studied 

set of six antique Portuguese coins.  

By the coins visual analysis regarding a macro scale morphologic approach 

several kind of patinas could be identified, namely a yellow- brownish layer on coins 

numbered 275, 279, 280 and 500 and a green one on 279 coin on the low relief areas; 

and a red-brownish coating on 257 coin.  

The interaction of the environment with the metallic material was also evidenced 

by the ?-EDXRF and the SEM/EDS results through the presence of elements such as Si, 

Cl, Ca, P and possibly K, Fe and Hg outside the alloy composition of the artefact. 

Moreover, ?-EDXRF results allowed to admit that Cu, Ag, Bi, Au and possible Sb, Pb 

and Fe can be present as part of the ore. In fact, it was verified that all the coins were 

made on billon alloy (copper/silver). However it was historically and scientifically 

proven the metal debasement during D. Fernando I period of reign.  

XRD analyses showed the presence of oxides, namely cuprite (Cu2O) in all coins 

and tenorite (CuO). In some cases malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) and some chlorides, 

mainly, nantokite (CuCl) and atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) were also identified. Moreover, 

in the numisms with high silver content, chlorargyrite (AgCl) was identified too (275, 

279, 280 and 275).  

The evolution of corrosion can be assumed as the initial formation of cuprite in 

concordance with the medium interface and its subsequent conversion into other 

chemical compounds according to the surrounding environment. The significant 

chloride contents and products (CuCl, AgCl, Cu2Cl(OH)3) may indicate a marine rich 

environment, compatibly with the coastal location of Portugal.  

Chlorides usually induce an autocatalytic copper corrosion. This fact may explain 

that 275 and 280 coins were the most damaged ones. This fact is proven by all the micro 

data collected. Finally is important to notice that other corrosion products should be 

present on the surface of the coins. However XRD is capable to detect only crystalline 

compounds. As consequence, other amorphous compounds are probably present as 

patina constituents, namely sulphates, phosphates, or others.

6 EXPERIMENTAL PART 

The experimental part on the development of nanomaterials for cultural heritage 

conservation consists on the syntheses and their characterization descriptions.  

6.1 Synthesis of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide 

nanoparticles  

6.1.1 Material and Reactants 

For the experimental process all the glassware was previously decontaminated 

with a 1 mol.dm
-3

 hydrochloric acid solution. The washing solution was made from HCl 

Carlo Erba Reagent 37% (w/w). The precipitates were prepared with Type I water 

obtained with a Milli-Q Elix 3 water purification system (R=5 to 15 M?.cm) (Merc
 

Milipore). Ethanol (absolute) (Analar Normapur), CaO (Riedel-de Haen; 

assay 96-100.0%) and DA (Fluka
 
Analytical; assay &gt; 99%) were used. The carbon 

dioxide was obtained from a CO2 welding gas cylinder model: 1480-10 (950 cc volume, 

tare 1120 g and 390 g of maximum content).  

6.1.2 Procedure 

In order to prepare the calcium carbonate nanoparticles the route proposed by 

Chen et al. [68] was followed.  

The process starts with the calcium hydroxide suspension preparation. It was done 

dispersing, approximately 2.356 g of CaO into 50 cm
3 

of deionised water, at 80
o
C 

(constant temperature) and kept overnight for ageing. A 0.1 mol.dm
-3

 ethanolic solution 

of dodecanoic acid (etanhol:DA) was prepared. Solution concentration was maintained 

constant varying only the volume added to the suspension. 0.5%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 

5.0% (w/w)
9
 suspensions were prepared. Annexe IV presents the criteria used in the 

suspensions choice (Figure A.IV.1) and a detailed description on the amounts of 

CaO (g) and ethanol:DA (dm
3
) used (Table A.IV.1). In order to simplify the text 

notation henceforth representative of the different dosages of the suspensions will 

x% DA (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 or 5.0). The mixture was stirred, at room temperature, and 

under magnetic starring for 2 hours. Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles were collected by separating

the suspension, at this point, in two parts. Approximately half of the suspension was 

collected and kept until wash and dry.  

A continuous flow rate of CO2 was carried into the remaining suspension with pH 

control (pH 7 units) and the CaCO3 suspensions were collected. The white powders 

were separated from the mother liquid by vacuum filtrations and were washed with 

deionised water and ethanol, several times.  

All the solids were dry in vacuum oven, at 60
o
C, for 24 h.  

6.2 Characterization of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide 

nanoparticles  

In order to study the nanoparticles´ stability; chemical nature; morphology and 

crystalline phase, their shape and size (including the surface characteristics and surface 

modifications) several techniques were used, namely visual dispersion analysis and 

turbidimetry; Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR); X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively.  

6.2.1 Nanoparticles dispersions analysis  

Several dispersions, using proportional amounts of CaCO3 (~0.027 g) and 

Ca(OH)2 (~0.020 g) synthesized powders were made (Annexe IV (Table A.IV.2)). The 

dispersions were prepared in cyclohexane obtained from PA Panreac (assay &gt; 99.5.0%) 

to a 20 cm
3
 total volume glass flask. The dispersions were sonicated in an ultrasound 

bath (Elma S 30H from Elmasonic) in various cycles of 10 minutes each. The number 

of cycles is dependent on the experience. In order to analyze the nanoparticles stability 

only the dispersions with the same number of cycles were compared.  

Based on the obtained results was decided that the highest point of interest were 

the 0.0% and 5.0% DA CaCO3 nanoparticles. For this reason a few more dispersions 

were made for the 5.0% functionalization, in order to compare all the dispersions and 

their stabilization capability varying the non-polar solvent, nonane (Sigma Aldrich), 

and/or introducing, on both dispersions (cyclohexane and nonane), 3 drops of 1-butanol 

(Fluka Chemika; assay &gt; 98.0.0%) to analyze the changes that this solvent may, or may 

not, induce (Table A.IV.3 in Annexe IV).

6.2.2 Turbidimetry 

Turbidimetry was used in order to study the particles´ stability on the cyclohexane 

dispersions. The equipment used was a Cary100 Bio, UV-Visible spectrophotometer, 

from Agilent Technologies, controlled by a Cary WinUV Kinetics software. The 

measuring conditions were set as follows: wavelength fixed on 500 nm and a 

time-cycle´ analysis depending on the observed stability on the dispersion.  

6.2.3 Attenuated Total Reflectance  

To study the chemical nature of the samples was used Attenuated Total 

Reflectance (ATR) technique. These measurements were performed with an Nexus 870 

FTIR ESP spectrometer with a golden gate (Thermo Nicolet) and a Graseby diamond 

ATR accessory (Specac), coupled with OMNIC software. CaCO3 functionalized 

powders with 0.0% DA and 5.0% DA spectrums were recorded at a constant ambient 

temperature with a spectral resolution of 2 cm
?1

 (?: 400-650 cm
-1

).  

6.2.4 X-ray Diffraction  

The powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advanced 

diffractometer coupled with a DIFFRAC-EVA commander software. The sample 

analyses were made on the 0.0% and 5.0% DA functionalized CaCO3 powders, using 

Cu-K? radiation, applying a tension of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The 0.02° steps in 

the    range from 5° to 80° were selected to analyse the crystal structure. Structural 

characterization of the samples was based on the # PDF-2-2003 database, on 

JCPDS/ICCD data and according to literature [66, 75, 103].  

6.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy  

Finally for the nanoparticles´ morphology characterization (shape and size) was 

used a Gemini FE-SEM for nano-scale analytics (Sigma Zeiss) coupled with Smart 

SEM software. Instrument setting was optimised for each single analysis looking for 

“compromise” conditions ensuring the best analysis quality by the detectors. The only 

fixed value was the extra high voltage set at 5.0 kV.

7 RESULTS PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION 

In this chapter a full presentation and discussion of the obtained results both 

global and at the various stages of the experimental procedure is presented.  

7.1 Nanoparticles´ visual dispersions analysis  

Several CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 dispersions were prepared in non-polar solvents, 

namely cyclohexane and nonane. Theoretically they must be stable for a period of 18 h 

to 24 h but in practice this point was not achieved.  

 

Figure 7.1 – CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles dispersions in cyclohexane from 0.0% to 5.0% DA after 6 

ultrasound cycles, 10 min each.  

Figure 7.1 presents the results for the 0.0% DA to 5.0% DA CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 

dispersions in cyclohexane after 6 ultrasound cycles of 10 min each and settling for 

30 min.  

After settling for 24 h it could be seen that, for the 0.5% and 1.5% DA dispersions 

any or just a little amount of powder was suspended into the dispersion. Here the 

cyclohexane phase remained transparent and the powder was (almost) completed settled 

down. For the 5.0% DA dispersions the suspended amount of powder was superior and 

some flocculation processes were observed.  

7.1.1 Number of ultrasonic cycles dependence  

During this work the influence of the number of ultrasonic cycles on the CaCO3 

and Ca(OH)2 dispersions were studied.  

After vary the number of cycles but maintaining the period of it, it was concluded 

that more cycles improve the nanoparticles dispersion.

7.1.2 Other dispersions (nonane and 1-butanol influence)  

Visually comparing the stabilizing effect of the different solvents (cyclohexane; 

nonane; cyclohexane+1-butanol and nonane+1-butanol) on the CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 

dispersions it could be concluded that, after the 3 first ultrasocinc cycles the most stable 

dispersion was the one with nonane+1-butanol. However, increasing the number of 

cycles it made clear that the best dispersion was the one composed only by cyclohexane. 

Another interesting conclusion was that 1-butanol increased the dispersion speed 

however it did not make teh dispersions more stable.  

Maybe any other solvent or mixture of solvents can produce more stable solutions 

however, based on the visual stability tests, cyclohexane is the best tested organic 

non-polar solvent for the obtained CaCO3 nanoparticles.  

7.1.3 Nanoparticles dispersions conclusions  

It could be concluded that the stabilization time of each dispersion was 

incompatible with the proposed end because it was too short in time. Thus, at this point 

and based only on their visual analysis, theoretically, these dispersions could not be 

used advantageously and with positive results for paper conservation.  

7.2 Turbidimetry  

Depending on the particles´ visual dispersions stability different time-cycle´ 

analyses were used on turbidimetry tests (Table 7.1). 

Table 7.1 – Time of analyses for the various cyclohexane dispersions of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2.

1.5 120 120

5.0 102 120 

 

Graphically and based on the obtained results it was found that no significant 

changes in the dispersions´ stability occur from 60 min on. Therefore, are now 

presented the stacked graphs with a maximum time limit of 60 min. Figures A.V.1 to 

A.V.5 and Figures A.V.6 to A.V.10 (Annexe A.V.1) present the full graphic results on 

CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 systems, respectively, for the full time range.

7.2.1 CaCO3 dispersions  

Figure 7.2 represent the stacked turbidimetry results for the CaCO3 with 0.0, 0.5, 

1.5, 2.0 and 5.0% DA dispersions in cyclohexane.

Table 7.2 shows the result comparison for the CaCO3 nanoparticles dispersions 

from 0.0% to 5.0% DA.  

Table 7.2 – Turbidimetry results comparison for the CaCO3 with 0.0% to 5.0% DA dispersions in cyclohexane, respectively.

5.0 1.949 0.499 1.450 72.901 

 

As expected, the initial absorbance value grew from the dispersions with 0.0% to 

5.0% DA content, i.e. more percentage of dodecanoic acid in the dispersion, higher was 

the initial absorbance of it. Apart from this, it can be concluded that higher amounts of 

acid made the settling time slower. Regarding to these results it could be concluded that 

the CaCO3 dispersions were not stable.

7.2.2 Ca(OH)2 dispersions  

The stacked turbidimetry results for the Ca(OH)2 with 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 

5.0% DA dispersions in cyclohexane are present on Figure 7.3. 

 

Figure 7.3 – Stacked turbidimetry results for the Ca(OH)2 with 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0% DA dispersions in cyclohexane. 

Table 7.3 presents the result comparison for the Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles 

dispersions from 0.0% to 5.0% DA.  

Table 7.3 – Turbidimetry result comparison for the Ca(OH)2 with 0.0% to 5.0% DA dispersions in cyclohexane, respectively.  

Legend: t1 – time until the curve reaches its constant value; absc – constant value of absorbance; absi – initial value of absorbance.

2.0 1.304 0.322 0.982 56.901 
5.0 1.096 0.536 0.560 81.201 

 

The Ca(OH)2 dispersions had identical behaviour to the CaCO3, under identical 

conditions and regarding the initial absorbance values and the time until the curve 

reaches its constant value, that is: higher DA percentages gave higher initial absorbance 

values and the time to reach stability increased from the low concentrated dispersion to 

the most concentrated one. The only exception is for the 0.5% DA sample which takes 

more time until reaches absorbance´ stabilization point than the immediately after 

content (2.0%); however the difference is not significant.  

These results made clear that Ca(OH)2 systems were more stable than the CaCO3 

dispersions. However it does not mean that they are perfect systems because neither one 

of them was enough stable for the proposed end.

7.2.3 Turbidimetry conclusions  

Generally and schematically it could be concluded, for both carbonate/hydroxide 

systems, that:  

 

Turbidimetry results verified what the visual analysis on the dispersions gave idea 

about. Neither CaCO3 nor Ca(OH)2 dispersions, regardless the dodecanoic acid 

functionalization percentage, were stable enough to the proposed goal.  

 

From this point on the analyses were made only for the calcium carbonate 

powders functionalized with 0.0% and 5.0% DA. This choice was made based on other 

studies that were being developed in the group as well as the innovation that comes 

from this new method of synthesis and dispersion.  

 

7.3 Attenuated Total Reflectance  

The stacked ATR spectra for CaCO3 nanoparticles with 0.0% and 5.0% DA are 

presented in Figure 7.4.

Calcium carbonate has a planar XY3 type structure which allows symmetric and 

asymmetric stretching between the atoms in the    
   ions. Since    

  
 typical peaks 

were identified it could be concluded that on 0.0% DA powder, CaCO3 was present in 

the sample. These results were used to confirm the presence of this compound on 

5.0% DA synthesized powder.  

On other hand the dodecanoic acid has a planar structure allowing the C-H (CH2 

and CH3) bendings on the aliphatic chain as week as the C=O stretches by the acidic 

group. On 5.0% DA sample both DA and its respective carboxylic acid salt peaks were 

identified allowing to confirm its presence on the final compound.  

7.4 X-ray Diffraction  

Figure 7.5 presents the stacked X-ray diffraction patterns obtained for the 0.0% 

and 5.0% DA CaCO3 powders. Tables A.V.1 and A.V.2 on Annexe A.V.2 present the 

individual peak identification according to # PDF-2-2003 database, JCPDS/ICCD: 

5-586 (CaCO3, calcite); 41-1475 (CaCO3, aragonite) and literature [66, 75, 103].

peak identification. Legend: C-calcite; A-aragonite; V-vaterite; and CL-calcium laurate.  

It could be concluded that calcite (rhombohedral symmetry) and aragonite 

(orthorhombic crystal system) were presented on the CaCO3 with 0.0% DA synthesized 

powder.  

In turn the X-ray powder diffractogram collected on CaCO3 sample with 

5.0% DA showed the presence of calcite, vaterite (hexagonal symmetry) and aragonite, 

three possible structures for this compound. Moreover, one of the most important peaks 

on this pattern was    = 7,423
o
. According to Sarkar et al. [66, 75] it corresponds to the 

calcium laurate structure which proved the crystalline salt (Ca(C12H23O2)2) presence. 

This fact was also observed on the ATR spectrum (Figure 7.4 (a)) and by the sharp 

morphology obtained on the SEM images (this topic will be discussed on the following 

chapter).

7.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy  

On Figure 7.6 the SEM images collected on the calcium carbonate particles 

functionalized with 0.0% and 5.0% of dodecanoic acid, respectively, can be seen.  

 

Figure 7.6 – SEM images on CaCO3 with 0.0% (a, b, c) and 5.0% (d, e, f) DA powders.  

Based on these images it could be concluded that for the 0.0% DA sample 

(Figure 7.6 (a, b and c)) something-like polymorphous clusters were present. These 

objects, according to the previous results, should be composed by a combination of 

calcite and aragonite and/or polymorphs materials. However, these items are bigger than 

nano-sized particles, being non-homogeneous even on their grain size.  

For the 5.0% DA CaCO3 powder (Figure 7.6 (d, e and f)) it could be seen that an 

evident morphology change occurred due the dodecanoic acid presence. The

polymorphous morphology changed to a sharp and pointed one. In this case, population 

was well distributed and with a small presence of, probably, nanoparticles.  

In general, it could be concluded that there was no significant amount of calcium 

carbonate nanoparticles in the synthesized powders. On both cases (0.0% and 5.0% DA) 

small populations (in the white circles - Figure 7.6 (a) and (d)) that possibly are 

nano-objects were observed. However its amount was not enough to admit that the 

synthesis was well achieved, not leading to the production of enough contents of 

nanomaterials. 

The morphology of the crystals ascertained by SEM images together with the 

diffraction patterns obtained by XRD allowed to state that DA has promoted a 

morphologic change from (something-like) calcite and/or aragonite to rosette shaped 

aragonite particles. Probably these rosette shaped particles were comprised of an 

aggregation of nano-aragonite rods explained by the aragonite needles tendency to 

aggregate and form this kind of rosettes structures. A similar morphology of aragonite 

has been reported by Sarkar et al. [66, 75]. Finally, DA complexed with the calcium 

ions yielding calcium laurate, which acted as a seed agent to nucleate, preferentially, 

aragonite instead of calcite.

8 CONCLUSIONS  

First of all it is important to note that the obtained results were different from the 

ones that were expected. In fact it was proved that the followed route was not able, 

under the specific applied conditions, to produce enough nanoparticles capable of 

reaching the proposed goal. 

Results from the visual analysis dispersions and turbidimetry technique (CaCO3 

and Ca(OH)2 with 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0% of dodecanoic acid dispersed in 

cyclohexane) were in concordance. Both results proved the instability, at least not the 

necessary one, of the dispersions. However and based in all the accomplished tests 

cyclohexane proved to be the best solvent from the studied set.  

Based on these results and according to other ongoing works in the group, the 

following studies were made on 0.0% and 5.0% DA calcium carbonate particles. 

According to ATR spectra, XRD patterns and SEM images it could be concluded that 

the reaction without any acid content was effective. It could be seen that calcite and 

aragonite structures were present but the nanoparticles amount was not significant. 

About the reaction with 5.0% DA the nanoparticles amount was again non-significant 

but the introduction of this organic fatty acid induced enormous morphology and 

crystallography changes on the CaCO3 particles. After the functionalization the powder 

showed the presence of calcite, vaterite, aragonite and the carboxylic acid salt (calcium 

laurate). It was evident the morphologic change to rosette shaped particles.  

Moreover, in both cases, the reduced amount of nano-objects can, probably, 

justify the non-stability dispersions.  

Chemically the dodecanoic acid changes are very interesting. However this 

CaCO3 functionalized powders are not useful for the main goal once the amount of 

nanoparticles was so reduce that the dispersed particles would not penetrate deeply 

inside the surface (due to their size). Therefore the powders would not be very effective 

against the internal acidity of the paper.

9 FUTURE WORK AND SIGNIFICANCE  

Patina evaluation is one of the best ways to do the evaluation on the conservation 

state of antique coins. First of all and taking advantage of the used techniques an 

examination on the coins cross-section by SEM/EDS would be helpful in order to study 

the coin stratification and constitution (patina and bulk). The use of other techniques 

such as Radio Frequency Glow Discharge (rf-GD-OES) in order to analyze the depth 

profiling (less evasive than cross-section) or Raman spectroscopy for the organic 

compounds, evaluations would be also interesting. However, all of these proposals 

involve destruction of the matrix under study. A detailed research and study on the ore 

provenance would also be very interesting. It was tried to study the ore origin however 

due the coins antiquity this information would required more time and resources. An 

interdisciplinary approach in order to understand the ore derivation and the consequent 

soil study would be recommendable.  

Nanomaterials for art and heritage conservation play an important role in the field 

of paper conservation. In fact, they are the future due the enormous interest in protect 

and treat the old papers and prevent the new one´s deterioration. Its operating costs have 

great potential even for big scale applications. It would be very interesting to see the 

made dispersions application and their characterization results, according to the exposed 

methodology. It would be the most effective form to confirm all the obtained and 

exposed results. As future work it is advisable the improvement of the proposed 

synthesis. Ameliorate parameters such as: make sure that the environment inside the 

synthesis flask is rich in carbon dioxide; a high and effective control on the reactants 

concentrations, maybe varying its proportions; as well as, a greater temperature control 

during the reactions, since this is a key point in the nanoparticles´ formation. This 

would help obtaining a more accurate model in order to create reduced particles size. It 

would also be beneficial experiment other non-polar organic solvents for the 

dispersions. Obtaining a better synthesis and understanding its dispersions, especially 

relatively on particle size, would further improve the results.

A - i i i  |  P a g e  

 

Annexe I  

DEFINITIONS 

1.
 Numismatics - science that studies coins in their essence, origin and expansion 

by internal and external trade.  

 

2.
 Cold working process – plastic deformation below the recrystallization 

temperature, at room temperature.  

 

3.
 Annealing – by heating the material and then slowly cool it to room temperature.  

 

4.
 Smelting – process to convert a substance or ore to its purest form by chemical 

reactions. 

 

5.
 Re-melting - process of changing a substance from solid to liquid form, by 

heating. In copper alloys this process results in a loss of certain of the included elements 

through oxidation, particularly arsenic and antimony [21].  

 

6.
 Sizing – introduction of a substance to paper in order to change its surface 

properties, e.g. to improve strength or reduce absorbency of water. Generally 

“papermaker’s alum” (or alum-rosin), an acidic hydrated aluminium sulphate 

(Al2(SO4)3.xH2O, where x=16 or 18) was added to early paper made from wood pulp, to 

harden and to help the gelatine sizing, making the paper somewhat water resistant so 

that inks did not “run” or spread uncontrollably. Synthetic sizing agents as alkyl ketene 

dimer used industrially to improve hydrophobicity in paper and alkenyl succinic 

anhydride as a wet strength additive in paper are nowadays used. 

 

7.
 Fenton mechanism – consists on the oxidation of an organic substrate by 

iron (II) and hydrogen peroxide. On this case the stability of the iron-gall ink complex is 

governed by the ratio between Fe (II) ions and tanning agent. The free Fe
2+

 ions present 

in the system act in redox reactions, usually catalyzing cellulose oxidation through a 

free radical mechanism, leading to the this mechanism. This decomposition can be 

stopped by introducing a chelating agent to complexing the Fe (II) in the ink [60-64].  

 



Annexe II  

STATISTICS FOR ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND METHOD 

EVALUATION  

For a set of n values where    is the individual value of x the following parameters 

can be defined.  

A.II.1  Mean  

The mean value (  ) is the arithmetic average of all measurements results. If the 

sample is randomly taken then the average is the best estimate of the population mean. 

The mean value is given by Equation A.II.1 [100]:  

   
 

 
     

 

   

 
 

Equation A.II.1 

A.II.2 Standard deviation, standard deviation of the mean and 

relative standard deviation 

Standard deviation (SD) (       is the positive square root of the variance for 

(n-1) degrees of freedom. This is a useful concept to express the confidence of 

analytical instrumental response and it is given by Equation A.II.2 [100]:  

       
 

   
        

 

 

   

 

 

Equation A.II.2 

Standard deviation of the mean          is an estimate of the standard deviation of 

the mean values that would arise if repeated samples were taken from the population 

(Equation A.II.3). Its value is smaller than the         [100, 101]. 

       
     

  
 

 
Equation A.II.3 

The relative standard deviation or coefficient of variation (RSD or CV) is a 

measure of the spread of data in comparison to the data mean. It is obtained through the 

ratio between the sample standard deviation and its mean (Equation A.II.4) [100, 101]:  



 

A - v  |  P a g e  

 

    
     

  
                 

         

  
  Equation A.II.4 

This parameter quantifies the incidence of random errors in the analytical result. 

The smaller the RSD better reproducibility of the method, since the spread of results 

around the mean value is lower [101].  

A.II.3 Uncertainty of the Limit of Detection  

In order to calculate the combined standard uncertainty relative to the LOD value 

Equations A.II.5 and A.II.6 were follow [100, 102]:  

    
      

  
  Equation 4.1 

         
   
  

    
   
  

    
   
  

          Equation A.II.5 

                 Equation A.II.6 

where u(LOD), u(ci), u(Nb) and u(Np) are the relative standard uncertainties from LOD, 

the concentration of the element i, and the counting rates for the background and for the 

peak, respectively. U(LOD) is the combined standard uncertainty for the LOD value and  

k is the coverage factor, in this case, k = 2,for a confidence level of, approximately, 

95%. 
 

A.II.4 Method precision  

The estimation of precision (uncertainty resulting from random errors) is 

performed by calculating the standard deviation, RSD or the variance of the sample [87, 

101]. Precision describes the method reproducibility. Greater precision imply higher 

equipment reproducibility [101]. In practice the precision of the method can be 

improved by controlling the random errors introduced during sample preparation and by 

the analytical instrument [87].

EXPERIMENTAL PART 

DEVELOPMENT OF NANOMATERIALS FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE 

CONSERVATION 

The criterion used for the suspensions choice was the contact angle´ tests (Figure 

A.IV.1) made by Chen et al. [68].  

 

Figure A.IV.1 – Effects of the weight ratio of DA on the CaCO3 particles  ?contact angle, obtained at 20° C 

with a Ca(OH)2 concentration of 5 wt.% [68].  

DA is used as a surface modifier and it changes the CaCO3 nanoparticles from 

hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Thus the image makes clear the choice of 0.0%, 0.5%, 

1.5%, 2.0% and 5.0% (w/w) functionalizations in order to evaluate the effect of this acid 

on the powders as well as in dispersions.

volume (dm

) added to each one of them.

A.IV.2 Nanoparticles dispersions  

In order to analyze the nanoparticles´ stability in cyclohexane several dispersions 

were made. The CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 masses used can be seen on Table A.IV.2.
