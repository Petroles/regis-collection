Abstract  

Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus, usually known as artichoke, is a Mediterranean 

specie with therapeutic properties, including antioxidant activity. This plant is a rich 

source of polyphenols, including caffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids. The use of 

bioactive ingredients or phytochemicals extracted from plant tissues in cosmetics is 

increasing, thus artichoke extract due to its constituents can be incorporated in topical 

formulations. 

The artichoke extract used in this study was obtained through an infusion technique, a 

conventional method in which dried leaves are placed in boiling water for a short period 

of time. Aqueous artichoke extract was characterized by high-performance liquid 

chromatography–diode array detector and a quantification of several constituents present 

in it, like proteins, carbohydrates, polyphenols and dietary fibers, was performed. Two 

purification strategies were adopted, including a gastric digestion followed by a dialysis 

that resulted in artichoke fraction A and a mucilage precipitation method. In this last 

method, two different assays were performed, one using acetic acid and the other without 

the use of acetic acid, resulting in artichoke fractions B and C, respectively. The purify 

fraction with higher polyphenols content was artichoke fraction C, which was chosen 

among all. The content of total phenols and tannins were determined along the 

purification processes, as well as the antioxidant activity. 

Artichoke Extract and Artichoke Fraction C were subjected to ROS scavenging activity 

and MTT cytotoxicity assays in HaCaT cell lines, being both good antioxidants and non-

toxic. Sun protection factor (SPF) was also measured in both fractions and the artichoke 

extract showed the highest SPF. 

These fractions were incorporated in O/W emulsions and hydrogels for topical 

application. Chemical and physical characterization and microbiological control, as well 

as cytotoxicity and membrane integrity assays, were performed on the products to ensure 

their quality and safety.  

The formulations containing the artichoke extract were considered the best choice 

according with the in vitro studies realized and the costs and time of production of each 

fraction, so these were chosen to proceed with the study. 



V 

 

ROS scavenging activity assays of the formulations containing artichoke extract showed 

powerful antioxidant activities. In vivo studies, including a human repeat insult patch 

testing (HRIPT) and an assessment of the protective effect against oxidative stress after 

UV radiation by chromameter evaluation, showed very good skin compatibility and no 

allergenic potential for all formulations, and according to the antioxidant activity assay, 

the artichoke gel was the formulation that presented a true in vivo antioxidant activity.  

The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract in 

topical formulations.  

 

Key words: Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus; artichoke; purification strategies; 

phenols; antioxidant activity; topical formulations; sun protection factor (SPF).

Resumo 

Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus, usualmente conhecida por alcachofra, é uma espécie 

pertencente à família Asteraceae e é característica da região Mediterrânea, sendo um dos 

vegetais amplamente consumidos nessa região. Assim, esta espécie representa uma 

importante fonte de rendimentos para a agricultura e economia dos países mediterrâneos, 

sendo Espanha, França, Itália e Grécia responsáveis por mais de 45% da produção 

mundial de alcachofra. 

A alcachofra é maioritariamente composta por água, proteínas, lípidos, hidratos de 

carbono, inclusive inulina, fibras e açucares, mas também apresenta na sua constituição 

minerais e vitaminas. Esta espécie é ainda altamente rica em polifenóis, especialmente 

em derivados de ácido cafeoilquínico, como é o caso do ácido clorogénico (3-O-ácido 

cafeoilquínico) e da cinarina (1,3-ácido cafeoilquínico), e ainda em flavonoides como o 

cinarósido (7-O-glucósido de luteolina). Estes são responsáveis pela atividade 

antioxidante associada à alcachofra, sendo que quanto maior o seu conteúdo em 

polifenóis, maior a sua capacidade antioxidante. Para além da sua atividade antioxidante, 

a alcachofra é conhecida pelas suas amplas propriedades terapêuticas: colerética, 

hepatoprotetora, anticarcinogénica, antibacteriana, antifúngica, anti-inflamatória e anti 

envelhecimento.  

Os compostos bioativos presentes em tecidos vegetais, tais como os polifenóis, são 

extraídos através de inúmeras técnicas, sendo que este processo depende de diversos 

fatores, como é o caso do pH, solubilidade, tempo de extração e temperatura. A escolha 

do método de extração é fundamental e de extrema importância uma vez que influencia a 

taxa de extração, o rendimento e a pureza dos compostos extraídos. A infusão é um 

método de extração convencional, no qual as folhas da espécie em causa são introduzidas 

em água a ferver por um curto período de tempo, sendo o tempo de extração e a 

temperatura os parâmetros com maior impacto. Estes métodos de extração resultam em 

frações com elevado nível de impureza. Assim, a purificação dos extratos através da 

remoção de materiais maioritariamente inertes é uma opção que visa a obtenção de 

frações com propriedades melhoradas, incluindo a atividade antioxidante. A digestão 

ácida com suco gástrico seguida de uma diálise e a precipitação de mucilagens presentes 

nos extratos vegetais são duas estratégias de purificação. 



VII 

 

A aplicação destes compostos em produtos cosméticos tem vindo a aumentar devido à 

proibição de utilização de ingredientes de origem animal e à procura de produtos naturais 

e sustentáveis. 

As formulações tópicas que têm por base extratos de origem vegetal têm como principais 

funções a proteção da pele contra efeitos exógenos e endógenos prejudiciais, e a 

manutenção do equilíbrio hidrolipídico da pele. E estas podem ser líquidas, tais como 

suspensões, soluções ou emulsões, ou semissólidas, como é o caso de pomadas, cremes e 

geles. As formulações semissólidas são preferíveis, dado que os ingredientes bioativos 

quando incorporados nestas podem ter ação nas camadas mais superficiais ou nas 

camadas mais profundas da pele, dependendo das características físico-químicas dos 

ingredientes bioativos e da finalidade das formulações, e ainda devido ao seu 

comportamento reológico. A qualidade, segurança e eficácia destes produtos são 

avaliadas através de diversos parâmetros físico-químicos, como o pH, homogeneidade e 

textura, através controlo microbiológico e estudos de irritabilidade cutânea, de 

citotoxicidade e de estabilidade, e ainda por parâmetros biométricos, tais como perda 

transepidérmica de água, hidratação, reforço da barreira cutânea, elasticidade, entre 

outros.  

O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar as propriedades antioxidantes do extrato de 

alcachofra e a sua utilização como ingrediente para produtos cosméticos antioxidantes.  

O presente estudo utilizou folhas de alcachofra, as quais foram submetidas a um processo 

de infusão, de filtração e liofilização com o intuito de extrair e estabilizar o extrato de 

alcachofra. A caracterização do extrato de alcachofra foi realizada através de métodos de 

quantificação específicos e revelou que este é constituído por 62.8% de fibras dietéticas 

solúveis e insolúveis, 3 % de polifenóis, 0.82% de hidratos de carbono e 0.002% de 

proteínas. 

Duas estratégias de purificação foram adotadas visando o melhoramento das atividades 

antioxidantes do extrato de alcachofra: digestão ácida seguida de uma diálise com duração 

de 24 horas que resultou na fração A, e precipitação de mucilagens, na qual se testou 

ainda a importância da utilização de ácido acético, que resultaram nas frações B 

(utilização de ácido acético) e C (ausência de ácido acético). Os extratos aquosos 

procedentes das purificações, bem como o extrato aquoso de alcachofra, foram analisados 



VIII 

 

através de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência (HPLC-DAD) com o intuito de 

acompanhar os processos de purificação e de dosear a cinarina, o ácido clorogénico e o 

cinarósido presente em cada fração. Estes compostos foram identificados em todas as 

frações estudadas, sendo que o extrato de alcachofra demonstrou ser o mais rico.  

A atividade antioxidante de todas as frações foi avaliada através do ensaio com o radical 

livre 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Todas as frações apresentaram atividade 

antioxidante, sendo que a fração que apresentou o melhor resultado foi a fração C, 

resultante da precipitação de mucilagens sem a utilização de ácido acético, com um EC50 

de 56 µg/mL.  

O extrato de alcachofra e a fração C foram estudados de forma mais detalhada. A sua 

atividade antioxidante foi ainda avaliada através de ensaios in vitro em queratinócitos, 

nos quais foram utilizados como agentes oxidativos o peróxido de hidrogénio e radiação 

UV. Ambas as frações não apresentaram diferenças significativas relativamente ao ácido 

ascórbico no caso da radiação UV, mas apresentaram ligeiras diferenças no caso do 

peróxido de hidrogénio.   

O fator de proteção solar (FPS) foi determinado, tendo-se obtido um FPS de 10.99 para o 

extrato de alcachofra e 10.20 para a fração C. A citotoxicidade foi também avaliada e 

apesar de se ter observado redução da viabilidade celular, os extratos foram considerados 

seguros. 

Ambas as frações foram incorporadas em dois tipos de formulações tópicas: emulsões 

O/W e geles. Ambas as formulações foram desenvolvidas com a máxima simplicidade 

possível, tendo-se utilizado apenas os ingredientes essenciais de forma a diminuir 

possíveis efeitos secundários provocados por algum ingrediente presente. Para cada 

formulação foi realizada uma caracterização físico-química (pH, viscosidade), e um 

controlo microbiológico. O pH ligeiramente acídico, entre 5.4 e 6.4, as propriedades 

reológicas e a quase total ausência de fungos e bactérias nos produtos cosméticos 

desenvolvidos, revelaram que estes são adequados e seguros para o uso tópico.  

Nos ensaios de citotoxicidade das formulações em queratinócitos observou-se uma 

diminuição da viabilidade celular associada às formulações que continham os 

ingredientes bioativos relativamente aos seus respetivos brancos. A nível da integridade 

membranar, apenas os cremes revelaram diferenças significativas quando comparados 



IX 

 

com o seu branco. Assim, as formulações foram consideradas biocompatíveis e seguras 

para o uso tópico.  

Tendo em conta os resultados dos estudos in vitro e os custos e tempo de produção de 

cada fração (extrato de alcachofra e fração C), foi decidido testar apenas as formulações 

contendo o extrato de alcachofra nos seguintes estudos in vitro e nos estudos in vivo.  

As atividades antioxidantes das formulações com o extrato de alcachofra incorporado 

foram avaliadas através de ensaios in vitro em queratinócitos, nos quais se utilizou 

peróxido de hidrogénio e radiação UVB como indutores de stress oxidativo. Os resultados 

demonstraram que ambas as formulações, creme e gel, apresentam atividades 

antioxidantes elevadas. Nos estudos in vivo, foram realizados um Human Repeat Insult 

Patch Testing (HRIPT) e um ensaio para determinar o efeito de proteção das formulações 

contra stress oxidativo induzido por radiação UV. Os resultados demonstraram que ambas 

as formulações, o creme e o gel, apresentam uma boa compatibilidade cutânea, e que 

apesar de ambas as formulações possuírem a capacidade de diminuir a atividade oxidante 

provocada pela radiação UVA, apenas o gel de alcachofra demonstrou uma atividade 

antioxidante verdadeira.  

O processo de infusão demonstrou ser um método eficaz na extração de polifenóis da 

alcachofra. O mesmo ocorreu para os processos de purificação realizados, uma vez que 

estes conseguiram melhorar as atividades antioxidantes de cada fração, mesmo daquelas 

com um menor conteúdo de polifenóis. Através de ensaios in vitro, as formulações 

desenvolvidas com os extratos eleitos revelaram ser adequadas e seguras para o uso 

tópico. Posteriormente, estudos in vivo também demonstraram que estas formulações 

eram dermatologicamente seguras, uma vez que não apresentaram reações adversas na 

pele nem potencial efeito alergénico. Para além disso, estes estudos comprovaram de 

novo o potencial antioxidante da alcachofra, sendo que o gel que continha o extrato de 

alcachofra apresentou atividade antioxidante in vivo. 

Este estudo demonstrou assim o potencial da alcachofra para ser introduzido em produtos 

cosméticos com finalidades antioxidantes e anti envelhecimento.

1. Chapter: Introduction 
 

1.1. Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus 

1.1.1. The Domestication of Artichoke 

The artichoke was already known and cultivated at the beginning of the Christian era [1]. 

The first mention to this specie was made by Theophrastus, the Greek (371-287 BCE), 

who described artichoke cultivation in Sicily and Southern Italy [2], and in 77 EC the 

medical benefits of this plant were reported by the Roman Pliny the Elder (ad 23–79, in 

Naturalis Historia). However, it’s estimated that domestication of artichoke only occurred 

between 800 and 1 500 CE, possibly in monastery gardens [3]. Records point Filippo 

Strozzi as the first merchant of this specie, who was responsible for trading artichokes 

from Sicily to Florence in the beginning of 15th century [4]. 

 

1.1.2. Taxonomy and Botanical Description  

Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus, usually known as globe artichoke, belongs to the 

family Asteraceae, subfamily Carduoideae and genus Cynara. Wiklund used a cladistics 

method based on morphological characterization to search the ancestry of Cynara crops 

and the results showed that the cultivated artichoke (C. Cardunculus var. Scolymus), leafy 

cardoon (C. cardunculus var. Altilis) and wild cardoon (C. Cardunculus var. Sylvestris) 

are included in a single species: C. Cardunculus L. [5]. A more recent study analyzed the 

phyletic relationships between Cynara species by using internal transcribed spacer 

sequences of the ribosomal regions, and the results were nearly in accordance with the 

phylogeny proposed earlier by Wiklund [6]. In Figure 1.1 are represented harvested 

artichokes and its habitat.

The globe artichoke is a perennial herbaceous plant, up to 80-180 cm tall, characterized 

by greyish green and deeply lobed leaves up to 75 cm in length. The flower heads are 5-

10 cm in diameter and consists of green bracts surrounding violet florets. Both bracts and 

florets are attached to a receptacle, commonly known as the heart [7]. 

At first the leaves of the globe artichoke are rosulate, but later they sprout and adopt an 

ovate-lanceolate shape. These leaves are silvery-grey, pinnatifid and normally large, up 

to 50 cm long by 20 wide. This specie is characterized by a voluminous ovate capitula, 

usually known as the head, which is characterized by a violet-blue flower that is placed 

on the top of the flowering stem, up to 1.5 m. This head is composed of thick, fleshy 

bracts called phyllaries (involucral bracts), which are broadly ovate and green or tinged 

with purple or wholly purple, and a fleshy base of the receptacle, also called heart. These 

are the edible parts of globe artichoke. 

 

1.1.3. Agroecology  

Globe artichoke has a wide adaptive range of 7-30°C, being a cool-season crop. 

Therefore, it should be planted in areas with day and night temperatures between 20-22°C 

and 12-14°C, respectively. This specie is very sensible to lower temperatures, and severe 

of frequent frosts can damage or kill it; but it tolerates well high temperatures (&gt;30°C), 

though it tends to decrease the quality of artichoke heads. It also requires long periods of 

sunlight, having a critical photoperiod of 10.5 hours [8]. 

The transition from vegetative to reproductive phase in seed-planted individuals depends 

on the interaction between the size of the plant, low temperatures and photoperiod. This 

type of artichoke has deep-rooted and can grow in several varieties of soils. However, it 

grows best on deep, fertile and well-drained soils with a pH range of 6-8. It requires a 

raised-bed culture when drainage of the field isn’t known, since globe artichoke dislikes 

water-logged soils [8]. 

 

1.1.4. Geographic Distribution  

Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals 

and olive oil, which provide numerous micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fibers 



3 

 

and polyphenols [9]. The artichoke is one of those vegetables, and it is consumed raw, 

boiled, steamed or fried, and therefore it’s used in numerous recipes [10]. 

This plant plays an important role in the agriculture and economy of the Mediterranean 

region, with a production of 199 900 t in Spain, 36 423 t in France, 547 799 t in Italy and 

28 600 t in Greece; it is also produced on a large scale in the North Africa – 777 671 t. 

Global production is approximately 1 793 016 t, making Mediterranean countries 

belonging to Europe – France, Spain, Italy and Greece – responsible for over 45% of 

artichoke production, which makes it a source of income that is helping the economy in 

this region [11].  

 

1.1.5. Phytochemistry 

The head of globe artichoke corresponds to 30-40% of its fresh weight [12] and the 

receptacle accounts for 33-55% of the head [13]. A raw globe artichoke is manly 

composed of water (84.94%); but it also contains proteins (3.27%), ash (1.13%), fat 

(0.15%), carbohydrates (10.51%), including inulin (1.8%), fibers (5.4%) and sugars 

(0.99%), such as glucose, fructose and sucrose. Minerals (0.66%) and vitamins (0.049%) 

are as well important components [14], [15].  

Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or substances that can originate 

such compounds through hydrolysis reactions, and they may be divided into three major 

classes: monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Plant polysaccharides 

can be classified into storage polysaccharide (e.g. inulin; the body can digest), cell-wall 

polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose; the body can’t digest it) and gums and mucilage. 

Structural fibers make up the plant cell walls and include lignin, cellulose, hemicelluloses 

and pectins.  

Globe artichoke has high content of carbohydrates, including the storage polysaccharide 

inulin. Inulin is a fructan-type polysaccharide that consists of (2?1) linked ?-d-fructosyl 

residues (n = 2–60), usually with an (1?2) ?-d-glucose end group (degree of 

polymerization ranging from 2 to 60 or more). Previous studies report a content between 

1.8 and 2.5% of inulin in this plant [16], [17].  Fibers are also one of the most abundant 

constituents in the artichoke, namely cellulose and lignin. Cellulose is an unbranched 

glucose water-insoluble polymer with around 3 000 glucose units and it is the most widely 



4 

 

distributed component of plant cell walls, and lignin is phenylpropane polymers 

synthetized from coumatyl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. Artichoke fibers are composed 

of 75.3 % of cellulose and 4.3% of lignin, being a rich-fiber plant [18]. Chemical structure 

of some compounds present in artichoke are showed in Figure 1.2. 

 

 

Phenolic compounds are one of the biggest and widely distributed groups of secondary 

metabolites in plants. All polyphenols share a common origin, the amino acid 

phenylalanine, which is deaminated to cinnamic or converted to tyrosine, and then it 

enters the phenylpropanoid pathway. Therefore, phenolic compounds have as a common 

characteristic, the presence of at least one aromatic ring hydroxyl-substituted. The 

polyphenols can be classified into simple phenols, hydroxybenzoic acid and 

hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, stilbenes, lignans and hydrolyzable as well 

as condensed tannins. These compounds are usually bounded to other molecules, 

commonly sugars and proteins, but they also exist in a small quantity in their free form, 

possibly due to its toxicity when in free state. They play an important role in plants,

namely in sensorial properties (color, aroma, taste and astringency), structure, pollination, 

resistance to pests and defense from predators and in grow, germinative and reproduction 

processes. According to literature, the outer and inner bracts, the receptacle and the leaves 

of globe artichoke contain polyphenols [10], [19], but its content can be influenced by the 

harvest time. The phenolic content can increase up to 16 times from winter to Spring 

harvest, especially in floral stem [20].  

Zhu et al. [21] identified four caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, 

3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and four flavonoids, 

luteolin-7-rutinoside, cynaroside, apigenin-7-rutinoside and apigenin-7-O-?-D-

glucopyranoside in artichoke leaf extracts, and Falé et al. [22] also identified cynaroside 

(luteolin-7-O-glucoside) and luteolin-7-O-(6’’malonylglucoside). However, the 

artichoke extract is mainly composed of caffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids, being 

the most abundant  cynarin (1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid) and chlorogenic acid (3-O-

caffeoylquinic acid)) [19], [23]. Chemical structure of some phenolic compounds present 

in artichoke are showed in Figure 1.3.

1.1.6. Therapeutic Properties 

Artichoke dried leaves have been used as a medicinal herb in traditional medicine for 

centuries because of its choleretic and hepatoprotective [24], anticarcinogenic[25], 

antioxidant [19], [22], [26], antibacterial [21], antifungal [27], anti-inflammatory [28] and 

antiphotoaging properties [29]. 

The hepatoprotective activity of artichoke was tested in isolated rat hepatocytes against 

CCl4 toxicity and the results revealed that cynarin and caffeic acid act in glutamine 

oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GTP), consequently 

showing hepatoprotective properties, while isochlorogenic acid and cynaroside act only 

in the GOT activity. Quinic acid and chlorogenic acid didn’t alter the toxicity of CCl4 

[30]. Another study showed that the artichoke leaf extract with the highest content in 

phenolic compounds exerted a more significant effect on bile flow and liver protection, 

but the results also showed that the administration of cynarin and chlorogenic acid as pure 

compounds didn’t revealed hepatoprotective or choleretic properties [24]. The 

investigators suggested that caffeoyl derivates have an important role in therapeutic 

properties of artichoke, but when administrated in their pure form, they aren’t effective. 

Mileo et al. [31] investigated the chemopreventive properties of artichoke edible parts 

through cytotoxicity assays on several cell lines and the results showed a similar level of 

toxicity in breast cancer cell lines but not any notable effects, even at high concentrations, 

on normal breast epithelial cells. This effect is due to the combined activities of several 

bioactive compounds present in the edible part of artichoke, since a study demonstrated 

that the artichoke extract has a faster and more pronounced apoptotic activity than the 

pure chlorogenic acid [32]. 

Through the measurement of the lag phase prolongation of conjugated diene formation, 

the decrease in the rate of propagation and a sparing effect on the a-tocopherol within the 

low density lipoprotein (LDL), artichoke extract showed to have the capacity to retard 

LDL oxidation in a dose-depend way. Pure luteolin revealed a lipid peroxidation 

inhibition similar to 20 µg/mL of artichoke extract, and luteolin-7-O-glucosine also 

showed a dose-dependent inhibition of LDL oxidation but was less effective than luteolin. 

Studies of cooper-chelating properties of these compounds suggested a potential role in 

the antioxidant activity of artichoke extract [33]. Artichoke has an EC50 of 123.1 ± 5.7

inhibition and DPPH scavenging activity) remain similar after gastric and pancreatic 

digestions [22].  

In order to examine the antimicrobial activities of artichoke leaf extract, three fractions 

of it in different solvents, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, were tested by disk 

assays. The results demonstrated that at least six types of bacteria, including B. subtilis, 

S. aureus, A. tumefaciens and M. luteus, and five fungi, including C. albicans, S. 

cereVisiae, S. carlsbergensis, A. niger and P. oxalicum, were susceptible to all artichoke 

fractions [21]. However, C. lusitaniae and M. mucedo were only susceptible to n-butanol 

fraction and C. cucumerinum was sensitive only to n-butanol and chloroform fractions. 

Therefore, the n-butanol fraction was considered the most active to all microorganisms 

tested. In the same study, eight phenolic compounds were isolated from n-butanol 

fraction, including chlorogenic acid, cynarin, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-di-O-

caffeoylquinic acid, luteolin-7-rutinoside, cynaroside, apigenin-7-rutinoside and 

apigenin-7-O-?-D-glucopyranoside, and the compounds that showed a higher 

antimicrobial activity were the chlorogenic acid, the cynarin, cynaroside and luteolin-7-

rutinoside. In following studies, artichoke leaf extract also showed antifungal activity 

against 7 foodborne bacterial pathogens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella 

typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida 

lusitaniae , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharo myces carlsbergensis , and 4 molds, 

Aspergillus niger , Penicillium oxalicum , Mucor mucedo and Cladosporium 

cucumerinum [27]. 

A group of 10 albino mice were administrated via oral with 10% infusion (dry plant) or 

20% (fresh plant) corresponding to 1 or 2 g/kg of several plants, and the analgesic and 

anti-inflammatory activities were measured by the number of contortions and Evans blue 

dye diffusion to the peritoneal cavity, respectively [34]. From 10 plants tested, artichoke 

was one of the two plants that showed powerful anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities 

[28]. In other study, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in blood serum of 

patients with chronic viral hepatitis C were normalized after using artichoke preparations 

during the medical rehabilitation period.  

Cynaropicrin is a bioactive sesquiterpene lactone and its content in artichoke extracts 

ranges between 0.44-1.60 % [35]. The administration of this compound found to be 



8 

 

effective against photoaging of the skin through the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa 

(NF-?B)-mediated transactivation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the matrix 

metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) in a dose-dependent manner [29]. NF- ?B is normally 

retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex but it is activated by UV radiation, which 

induces bFGF and MMP-1 production [36], [37]. Was also confirmed that in an in vivo 

mouse model, cynaropicrin is able to prevent skin photoaging, which is traduced in a 

hyperproliferation of melanocytes and keratinocytes [29]. 

 

1.1.7. Artichoke Waste Phytochemicals 

The waste produced by the artichoke processing industry, such as leaves, outer bracts and 

stems, can form up to 80-85% of total biomass of the material, and it is normally used as 

organic mass, animal feed [38], and fuel [39] and fiber production [40].  

In the artichoke waste were reported 45 phenolic compounds, including gallic acid; 

caffeoylquinic acid 1,2 and 3; dicaffeoylquinic acids 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7; protocatechuic 

acid; esculin; chlorogenic acid; p-coumaric acid-O-glucoside isomers 1 and 2; 

eriodictyolglucuronide; rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside); dicaffeoylquinic acid 

derivative; hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-galactoside); luteolin-7-O-rutinoside; cynaroside 

(luteolin-7-O-glucoside); isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-O-glucoside); luteolin-7-O- 

glucuronide; luteolin-7-O-galactoside; naringenin-O-hexoside; avicularin (quercetin-3-

O-arabinoside); isorhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-rutinoside); quercetin-O-pentoside; quercitrin 

(quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside); luteolin-7-O-neohesperidoside; apigenin-O-glucoside; 

prunin (naringenin-7-O-glucoside); naringin (naringenin-7-O-neohesperidoside); 

scolimoside (luteolin-7-O-rhamnoside); apigenin-7-O-glucuronide; quercetin-O-

pentoside; phloridzin (phloretin-2-O-glucoside); feruloylquinic acid-O-glucoside; 

luteolin; quercetin; naringenin; and apigenin chrysoeriol. Among all components, 

caffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids showed to be the main components of artichoke 

waste [41]. 

Knowing the therapeutic properties of all artichoke components combined, the actual use 

of artichoke by-products is questionable and since it has several health benefits, 

alternatives for its use should be considered. Production of natural nontoxic food 

additives, neutraceuticals or cosmetics using artichoke as bioactive ingredient are some 

options for the use or artichoke by-products.

1.2. Purification Methods 

Extraction is the separation of active ingredients of plant tissues from the inactive or inert 

compounds through the use of selective solvents in standard extraction techniques.  The 

plant extracts obtained are still a relatively impure liquid, semisolid or powders and 

include several chemical compounds with different functions and structures, such as 

polyphenols [42]. The extraction of polyphenols from leaves depends on many factors 

including pH, solubility, extraction time and temperature [43]. However, the extraction 

method has effects on the rate, yield and purity of these compounds, so the method choice 

is crucial. 

Infusion is a conventional method, in which dried leaves are placed in boiling water for a 

short period of time. The temperature and extraction time are parameters with impact in 

the total polyphenol content and consequently in antioxidant activity [42]. Liang et al. 

[44] investigated the influence of temperature on the extraction efficiency and 

degradation of polyphenols in green tea. The results showed that at a temperature of 

100°C, the green tea catechins suffered alterations on their configuration to their isomers, 

and at 80°C the catechins epimerization was inhibited. Therefore, the extraction should 

be executed at a temperature between 80 and 100°C. Another study showed that a 

prolonged extraction period leads to the degradation of a large fraction of flavonoids 

present in green tea [45]. The investigators concluded that the conventional procedure of 

pouring boiling water to the cup with the herbal leaves and let it rest for 10 minutes is the 

proper way to infuse the herbs. This extraction technique is usually followed by a 

filtration procedure in order to separate the plant tissues from the solution containing the 

bioactive compounds. The vacuum filtration is a well-know and simple method that 

consists in passing the stream through a porous filter, which is capable of retaining the 

solids. This filtration requires a pressure drop in order for the liquid to flow through the 

filter, and this pressure can be achieved by creating a vacuum or a centrifugal force, by 

raising the pressure more than the atmospheric pressure or by designing to make use of 

gravitational force [46]. The vacuum filtration schematic is represented in Figure 1.4. 



10 

 

 

To finalize the active substances extraction procedure from herbs, a lyophilization of the 

herb infusion is required to remove its water content, which enhances its stability. To 

proceed to the lyophilization, the herbal infusion needs to be frozen in order to separate 

the solvent from the solutes, since the water forms ice crystals and the solutes will be 

confined in the interstitial region between those crystals. Then the pressure in the system 

is reduced and heat is applied to the frozen herbal infusion, which will lead to the 

sublimation of the ice crystals formed previously. A dried mixture, usually named cake, 

is the result of this process, but it may contain 5-10% (w/w) of water adsorbed onto its 

surface. In some cases, if the water content in the cake is still too high and consequently 

its stability isn’t the desired, a second drying is performed through the increasing of 

temperature and reducing of partial pressure of water vapor in the container [47]. The 

diagram of a lyophilization is represented in Figure 1.5.

is market by ‘A’, in a glass container with the lyophilization closure positioned for the drying process; Figure 1.5.2.

drying process and the interstitial cake portion is denoted by region market as ‘C’; Figure 1.5.4. illustrated the 

completion of secondary drying. Figure 1.5.5. demonstrates the final product with the closure in its stoppered position.

11 

 

The herbal extracts obtained from the previous method are still impure, so a purification 

is required in order to enhance its properties, including the antioxidant activity. Two 

different approaches can be followed in order to purify the herb infusion: gastric digestion 

followed by dialysis and mucilage precipitation. 

Tagliazuchi et al. [48] investigated the bio-accessibility of the major classes of 

polyphenols from Red Globe grapes through an in vitro model that simulated some 

chemical (pH, temperature and bile salts) and biological (gastric and pancreatic enzymes) 

gastro-intestinal conditions. The investigators concluded that the content of bio-

accessible polyphenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins increases during gastric digestion, 

and that the gastric digestion has no effect on the stability of polyphenols. Therefore, it is 

advantageous to perform a gastric digestion of infusions in order to increase its bio-

accessible polyphenols content, which will consequently improve its health benefits. 

Afterwards, a dialysis is required to separate the polyphenols from other large and 

complex molecules present in the herbal infusion, and consequently purify it. Dialysis is 

a separation method, based on the differential diffusion, of solutes with different 

molecular size through a membrane. This procedure is considered slow but it is efficient 

in separating small solutes from large molecules, and due to its simplicity, it is a method 

of choice. In this technique, the solution to be dialyzed is inserted in a dialysis membrane 

and then it is placed in a container with water for some hours or even days. In this process, 

a way of stirring the solutions is advisable and for that purpose, a magnetic stirred can be 

used to gently move continuously the dialysis membrane [49]. 

Another purification method is the precipitation of mucilage, a polysaccharide mixture 

that can be found in plant tissues of higher plants, present in herbal infusions. Kim et al. 

[50] investigated the effects of pectic mucilage removal from cactus cladodes (Opuntia 

humifusa Raf) and the results showed that along with the mucilage elimination occurs an 

increase of total polyphenols, and since these compounds contribute to antioxidant 

activity, it also resulted in an enhanced antioxidant activity.

1.3. Oxidative Stress in Skin  

The skin covers the entire surface of our bodies and it corresponds approximately to 15% 

of total adult body weight, being the biggest organ in human body [51]. It consists of 

differentiated cells and tissues that perform several functions in our body, such as defense 

against other organisms, maintenance of body temperature and protection from external 

environment [52]. The protection of external physical, chemical and biological 

aggressions is due to a complex structure that has different tissues, like epithelial, 

connective, vascular, muscular and nervous, which are organized in three distinct layers: 

epidermis, dermis and hypodermis [51]. The skin also has several specialized structures 

with different functions called appendages (sebaceous, eccrine sweat and apocrine glands, 

and hair follicles). The epidermis is a tough stratified epithelium composed of cells with 

different embryonic origins, such as melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells and 

mostly keratinocytes. It exhibits a progressive differentiation (keratinization and 

cornification) from the basal to the surface, which results in different appearances of cells 

from one layer to another [52]. Basal cells are attached to an underlying basal lamina in 

the innermost layer, and above this one is the stratum spinosum composed of prickle cells. 

Upward is a thin layer consisting of granular cells - stratum granulosum - which form a 

waterproof barrier, being this one of the most vital functions of the epidermis. This layer 

is attached to the outermost layer called corneal stratum, which consists of dead cell with 

no intracellular organelles. This cells rich in keratin are connected by a thin and tough 

layer of proteins, including cytoplasmic protein involucrin [53]. Epidermis is associated 

with some appendages like pisosevaceous follicles and sweat glands [51]. Skin layers are 

represented in Figure 1.6.

stains section of normal skin. Illustration from Freinkel et al, 2001. 



13 

 

Below the epidermis is the dermis, a connective tissue component of the skin that protects 

the epidermis and provides elasticity and support [51]. The dermis has less cells than the 

epidermis and it is composed of fibrous molecules, dermal cells, a ground substance, 

appendances, neurovascular networks and sensory receptors. Its function is to protect the 

body from physical injuries, to retain water, regulate the temperature and it has receptors 

of sensory regulation [52]. It has a continuous turnover system that regulates the synthesis 

and degradation of its protein and it’s composed of the papillary and reticular layers [54]. 

Papillary layer is the upper layer and it is formed of thin collagen fibrils that form thicker 

collagen fibers [54], cells (fibroblasts, dermal dendrocytes, mast cells), vessels and nerve 

endings, being this layer the connection between the dermis and epidermis [51]. Bellow 

this one is the reticular layer that is composed mostly of type I collagen and fibers, and 

has only about 15% of dermal collagen which is mostly found in the papillary layer [54]. 

The deepest part of the appendages, vascular and nerve plexures are retain in this last 

layer [51]. The deepest layer of the skin is the hypodermis that serves as a reserve of 

energy, protects the skin from mechanical injuries and has a role in thermoregulation [52]. 

This layer is mostly composed of large adipocytes with a very weakly osmiophilic 

cytoplasm, which show pericellular expression of S100 protein and vimentin [51]. The 

adipocytes are organized in primary and secondary lobules separated by connective tissue 

septa containing cells, such as fibroblasts, dendrocytes and mast cells [51]. The fat cells 

are in continuous renovation through the accumulation of lipids on their inside, 

proliferation of adipocytes and recruitment of undifferentiated cells from mesoderm. This 

continuous system appears to be regulated by a hormone released from adipocytes called 

leptin [52]. The hypodermis also accommodates vessels, nerves and the deepest part of 

sweat glands [51].  

In 1955, Denham Harman articulated an innovated biochemistry theory that suggested a 

correlation between oxygen radicals produced by the cells and the aging process. 

According to his theory, oxygen radicals such as HO? and HO2? were generated inside 

cells, most likely due to the interaction of respiratory enzymes and the molecular oxygen 

and to the action of catalase on hydrogen peroxide, and they were responsible for damages 

in DNA and proteins, and consequently for the ageing and cancer [55]. Despite the 

controversy around this theory back in those days, in the present day it is well proved.  

Skin is exposed to several harmful agents, such as ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation, 

air pollution and biologic contaminants, that contribute for the production of reactive 



14 

 

oxygen species (ROS) in epidermal tissues. ROS are compounds derived from molecular 

oxygen, O2, but due to chemical reactions they have extra electrons, which make them 

unstable. Hydroxyl radicals, HO?, are a result from homolytic cleavage of hydrogen 

peroxide, H2O2, and superoxide, O2?, a result of molecular oxygen reduction. These two 

radicals and hydrogen peroxide are largely produced by the cells as a result of several 

biological mechanisms [56].  

Among differentiated cells, human keranocytes are the most exposed to harmful agents, 

including oxidative stress associated with ROS overproduction, and they are further 

modulated by exposure to UV radiation, chemical compounds, rich-oxygen environment 

and inflammatory processes. Orciani et al. [57] determined the susceptibility of isolated 

mesenchymal stem cells from human skin (S-MSCs) to oxidative stress and compared the 

results with keratinocytes, which are differentiated cells of the same lineage. Cells were 

exposure to H2O2, a stress oxidative inductor, for 2 hours and the oxidative stress effects 

were analyzed after 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours of recovery, and the data reported a greater 

antioxidant defense for the keranocytes, while stem cells, which are surrounded by a 

protective environment, weren’t able to overcome oxidative stress. However, human 

keranocytes can still suffer damage at a long-term exposition to harmful agents, like UV 

radiation [58]. 

At high levels, ROS can induce damage to cell structures, lipids, nucleic acids and 

proteins, which can contribute to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and ageing [59]. Human 

organism have developed several defensive strategies, like preventative and repair 

mechanisms, and physical and oxidant defenses [59], but these are not always capable to 

respond to an ROS overproduction and occasionally some errors may occur. Therefore, 

the search for new compounds with the capacity of preventing these oxidative stress 

events is constant.  

UV radiation is divided in three distinct types of radiation: UVC (wavelength 200-280), 

UVB (wavelength 290-315nm) and UVA (315-400nm). The UVB and UVC are mostly 

filtered by the ozone layer, therefore only 5-10% of highly energetic UVB reaches the 

skin, being the rest UVA radiation [60]. The UVB radiation is mainly absorbed by the 

epidermis, while UVA radiation is able to penetrate into the dermis and it also interacts 

with the stratum corneum and epidermis [61]. There are some chromophores in the skin 

that can absorb UV radiation, such as melanin, DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, aromatic 



15 

 

amino acids – tyrosine and tryptophan – and urocanic acid [62]. This absorption can lead 

to several photochemical reactions and secondary interactions with ROS, which can result 

in inflammation, photoaging, immunosuppression and skin cancers – cutaneous 

malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [61]. UVA and 

UVB radiation have different wavelength and therefore, they show distinct properties 

concerning their biological effects on our skin, being UVB radiation more mutagenic and 

cytotoxic than UVA. UVA radiation interacts with endogenous photosentisizers resulting 

in ROS production, which may cause damage to DNA, proteins and membranes. On the 

contrary, UVB radiation is highly absorbed by DNA resulting in its disruption and the 

production of photoproducts like cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrumidone. 

A consequence of these photoreactions is the accumulation of defective DNA that can be 

the trigger to mutations of genes that regulate the tissue homeostasis and genome 

integrity, for example the p53 tumor suppressor gene [60]. UVB radiation modifies the 

epidermal morphology, including the thickness increase of the corneal stratum, 

modification of cell cohesion and mechanical integrity of corneal stratum and disruption 

of the permeability barrier, resulting in transepidermal water loss, changes in the lipids of 

corneal stratum and decreased corneal stratum hydration [61]. 

Polyphenols from plant tissues have been described as powerful antioxidants that can 

support the skin’s own antioxidant defense against oxidative stress when applied topically 

[63], [64]. These compounds also have photoprotective properties [65] and sun protection 

factor (SPF), which ranges between 7 and 29 for stilbenes, flavonoids and 

hydroxycinnamic acid homologues [66]. 

 

1.4. Topical Formulations 

Nowadays, plant extracts are being more used in cosmetic formulation, mostly due to the 

prohibition of the use of animal origin ingredients and to an increase search for 

ecofriendly and sustainable products. These plant extracts are very different from purified 

therapeutic agents, since plant extracts are more dilute and usually contain more bioactive 

ingredients that may be related chemically and therapeutically to the main component 

responsible for the desired effect [67]. The use of bioactive ingredients or phytochemicals 

extracted from plant tissues in cosmetics have two major purposes, including body care 

and as a source of nutrients for a healthy skin [68].  



16 

 

In cosmetics is possible to use the entire plant extract, which is mostly applied according 

with its known therapeutic effects, or selective plant extract, which is used according to 

the investigations studies on its properties [67]. Usually, these botanical products are rich 

in vitamins, hydrocolloids, proteins, antioxidants, essential oils and other bioactive 

compounds [69]. Cosmetic formulations containing bioactive ingredients from a natural 

source are designed to protect skin against exogenous or endogenous harmful agents and 

to equilibrate the dermal hydrolipid content, which suffers alterations due to ageing and 

dermatosis [67].  

To develop a good formulation, simplicity is required and the shorter the ingredient list, 

the better, since it diminishes the possible adverse effects due to a compound present in 

it and the costs of production. The formulation design has to balance the ingredients used 

in order to create a product stable and easy to apply, and that maintains its functions 

during manufacturing, on the shelf and during and after application.  

Topical dermatological products can be administered easily and they can be liquid, such 

as suspensions, solutions and emulsions, or semisolid, including ointments, gels and 

creams. Active ingredients incorporated in topical formulations can stay on the surface 

layers of tissues or can penetrate into deeper layers, depending on its physicochemical 

properties, its action and the formulation approach. 

Creams are semisolid emulsions made with two immiscible liquids, water and oil, in 

which one is considered the dispersion phase and it is dispersed into the other phase, 

which acts as the dispersion medium, resulting in a stable dispersion. The main 

ingredients of these formulations are emollients, humectants, surfactants, preservatives, 

chelating agents, perfumes and others. The equilibrium between water and oily 

ingredients may produce different formulations in order to suit different purposes (skin 

types, skin conditions, age of user and living environment). Usually, the main functions 

of creams are to maintain the moisture balance and keep the skin moist and supple by 

supplying water, humectants and oils [70]. There are two categories of creams according 

to the surfactants and oily ingredients used: O/W or W/O emulsions. In O/W emulsions 

are used hydrophilic surfactants and the oily ingredients can vary widely from non-polar 

to polar. On the contrary, in W/O emulsions are mostly used lipophilic surfactants and 

the oily ingredients are mainly non-polar. The W/O type has been used to increase the 

oily nature and the O/W type when a light feeling is wanted [70].   



17 

 

Gels are a type of base with a uniform external appearance that can vary from transparent 

to semitransparent and they provide a moist feeling. These formulations can be divided 

into two categories, aqueous or oily gels. Aqueous gels are used as a base material and 

are known for their water supplying, moisturizing and cooling effects. Oily gels supply 

oil to the skin and have moisturizing properties as well. The main compounds of gels are 

polymers and solvents [70]. Polymers are a crucial gel constituent and they can be 

classified based on source (natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic), structure (linear, 

branched chain, crosslinked or network polymer), polymerization type (addition or 

condensation polymers), molecular forces (elastomers, fibers, thermosetting, 

thermoplastic), chain growth polymerization (free radicals governed) or degradability 

(biodegradable or non-degradable) [71]. Water soluble polymers can be applied in several 

industries, like food, paint, textiles, paper, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, water treatment, 

among others, and can be divided into two categories, synthetic or natural. Synthetic 

water soluble polymers can be dissolve, disperse or swell in water and can work as a 

gelation, thickening or emulsification/stabilization agent, which result in alterations of 

physical properties of aqueous systems. These include poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), 

polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Polyacrylamides, Polyacrylic 

acid (PAA), N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA), Divinyl Ether-Maleic 

Anhydride (DIVEMA), polyoxazoline, Polyphosphates and Polyphosphazenes; and 

natural water soluble polymers include xanthan gum, pectins, chitosan derivatives, 

dextran, carrageenan, guar gum, cellulose ethers, hyaluronic acid (HA), albumin and 

starch or starch based derivatives [71]. 

The quality, safety and efficacy of a topical formulation is evaluated by physical and 

chemical parameters such as pH, homogeneity, texture, microbiological control, skin 

irritation studies, cytotoxicity, stability and biometric parameters, including 

transepidermal water loss, hydration, strengthening the cutaneous barrier and elasticity, 

among others.  

Under normal physiological condition, skin has an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.5 that 

depends on the region. The acidic skin pH contributes to the defense against 

microbiological or chemical agents, the skin barrier homeostasis and stratum corneum 

desquamation [72]. Therefore, since skin pH has several important biological functions 

and its change could compromise the functions of topical formulations, these should 

present a pH value similar to skin pH.  



18 

 

Rheology, the science that studies the behavior of materials when they are under the 

influence of external forces, is a fundamental parameter in the development of 

formulations, but also in its manufacturing and application, and to ensure long shelf-life. 

Viscosity and elasticity are the simplest rheological properties [73]. Newtonian fluids are 

viscous but not elastic materials, like water, that under the smallest force, spend all energy 

in flowing; and Hookian bodies are elastic but not viscous materials, like rubber, that 

spends the force applied to change its shape and stores the energy. The semi-solid 

formulations have both viscosity and elasticity, being characterized by complex 

rheological properties, which depends on their internal structure [70].  

Different rheological fluid behaviors are observed in topical formulations: shearthinning, 

dilatant fluids, thixotropic and rheopectic. A purely viscous fluid is said to be 

shearthinning and is characterized by a viscosity decrease along with a shear rate increase. 

In dilatant fluids, the apparent viscosity increases with increasing shear rate. 

Shearthinning and dilatant fluids are independent of time. At a constant shear rate, the 

shear stress decreases monotonically in the case of thixotropic fluids and the shear stress 

increases monotonically in rheopectic fluids. These last types are time dependent fluids 

[74].  

Topical formulations contain several ingredients, like oil, water and glycerin (source of 

carbon), and substances, like amino acids derivatives and proteins (source of nitrogen), 

that can encourage the growth of microorganism. Therefore, to assure its quality is 

necessary to add preservatives, which are able to suppress the proliferation of 

microorganisms that may have contaminated it and to kill them, thereby preventing the 

product deterioration. To assure the near or total absence of microorganisms, two methods 

are largely used in microbiological control: total aerobic microbial count (TAMC) and 

total combined yeasts and molds count (TYMC) tests [70].  

Human repeated insult patch testes (HRIPT) is one of the most used methods to evaluate 

the safety of finished cosmetics products, which is performed under exaggerated 

conditions of product exposure. This test requires a large group of subjects (100) and can 

be performed in several different manners with distinct exposure times and occluding 

methods. The subjects are exposed to the cosmetic products during a 3 weeks’ period, 

which is followed by a 2 weeks’ rest period. Afterwards, the challenge period is 

performed using a 24 or 48 h patch test and the resulting reaction is categorized for clinical 



19 

 

signs. The product concentration used is determined by prior sensitization test results 

performed in animals, results from repeated application irritation patch studies in humans 

and prior experience [75]. 

To study the efficacy of cosmetic products are used non-invasive techniques, such as 

elasticity, skin thickness, wrinkling, roughness, transepidermal water loss, hydration, 

strengthening the cutaneous barrier and elasticity, among others. These parameters can 

evaluate possible adverse reactions and changes that may occurred in the skin, hair or 

nails after the use of a cosmetic product.  

A cosmetic to be considered safe according to regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009, shouldn’t 

show adverse effects on normal or sensitive individuals like skin irritation, sensitization, 

phototoxicity and photosensitization.

2. Objectives 

The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract in 

topical formulations. 

For this purpose, other tasks with a high interest were also proposed: 

? Increase the acknowledge of purification strategies of plant extracts that may be 

used posteriorly in other species studies and even in industrial processes; 

? Found new applications for this specie since it is highly produced and has an 

enormous economic value in the Mediterranean region.

3. Chapter: Materials and Methods 
 

3.1. Purification and Chemical Analysis  

3.1.1. Preparation of Artichoke Extract  

Cynara Cardunculus Scolymus bracts from DIATÉTICA® were acquired and an infusion 

with 91.02 g of it in 910.2 mL of boiled distilled water was performed for 10 minutes. 

This process was followed by a vacuum filtration with a 70 MM filter in order to remove 

the bracts from the aqueous part. 

3.1.2. Artichoke Extract Dialysis  

A gastric juice solution was prepared through the addition of 320 mg of pepsin and 200 

mg of NaCl to 100 mL of distilled water with a pH of 1.2, which was previously acidified 

with HCl 37%, and was also prepared a 50 mg/mL artichoke solution. A dialysis mix was 

prepared with 50% of gastric juice and 50% of artichoke solution, and then put in a bath 

at 37°C for 60 minutes. Afterward, this mix was added to a dialysis membrane, which 

was place inside of a goblet with 100 mL of acidified distilled water (pH 1.2) at room 

temperature. The dialysis process lasted 24 hours. The outer waters were exchanged a 

few times to prevent its saturation and were preserved in a recipient, and aliquots were 

collected during the process to evaluate its efficacy. 

3.1.3. Mucilage Precipitation 

In order to precipitate the mucilage present in the artichoke extract, two different 

approaches were adopted: a method found in literature using acetic acid [1] and the same 

method readapted without the use of acetic acid. 0.5 g of artichoke extract were dissolved 

in 25 mL of distilled water, and then this solution was added to 100 mL of A solution 

(96% ethanol and 1% 100% glacial acetic acid) or B solution (96% ethanol), according 

to the methodology chosen. A centrifugation at 2 600 g for 10 minutes was followed. The 

supernatant was separated from the pellet and reserved in a recipient for posterior 

lyophilization. The pellet was dried in a nitrogen line. The initial mass wasn’t always the 

same, but the reagent proportions used were always equal. The assay with use of acetic 

acid resulted in artichoke fraction B and the assay with no use of acetic acid in artichoke 

fraction C. 

 



26 

 

3.1.4. McCleary Method  

The McCleary method (AOAC 2009.01) was also performed with the purpose of 

precipitate the mucilage. The artichoke fraction C obtained from the mucilage 

precipitation method with no use of acetic acid, was the fraction chosen to perform this 

method.  

Initially, 30 mg of artichoke fraction C were dissolved in 2 mL of distilled water with a 

pH of 1.2 and then 2 mL of gastric juice were added, and then the mix was place in a 

water bath for 60 minutes at 37°C. After the first digestion, the mix was placed in the 

refrigerator for 60 minutes. A centrifugation at 2 600 g for 10 minutes at 4°C was 

followed, but it didn’t form any pellet. Afterwards, another digestion was performed 

adding 2 mL of pancreatic juice to the mix again. The pH of this mixture was adjusted to 

6.0 through the addition of 1 M NaOH. The mix was placed again in the water bath at 

37°C for 60 minutes, and then reserved again in the refrigerator for 18 hours. A 

centrifugation with the same conditions as before was realized, and the supernatant was 

separated from the pellet for posterior lyophilization and the pellet was dried in an azote 

line.  

The gastric juice was prepared adding 320 mg of pure pepsin and 200 mg of NaCl to a 

total volume of 100 mL of distilled water previously acidified with 37% HCl to a pH of 

1.2. The pancreatic juice was prepared adding 250 mg of pancreatin from porcine 

pancreas (8 × USP specifications) to a 50 M sodium phosphate buffer solution pH 8, 

which was prepared using 5 mL of Na2HPO4 sodium phosphate buffer solution and 5 mL 

of NaHPO4 sodium phosphate buffer solution. 

3.1.4. Samples Drying 

3.1.4.1. Lyophilization  

All samples obtained throughout the study were lyophilized in order to prevent its 

degradation. The samples were put in falcons or plastic recipients and then were 

lyophilized until its total dryness in a Heto PowerDry LL3000. 

 

 

 



27 

 

3.1.4.2. Solvent evaporation with rotary evaporator 

In order to separate the fractions from undesirable compounds, a solvent evaporation with 

rotary evaporator was performed at 60°C in a Büchi Rotavapor R-200. The period of time 

varied according with the time needed to evaporate all liquids present in the solution. 

3.1.5. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC -

DAD)  

HPLC-DAD analysis were performed in order to quantify the chlorogenic acid, 

cynaroside and cynarin and to observe the compounds present in the dry extracts. The 

HPLC-DAD analysis was performed in an Elite LaChrom® VWR Hitachi liquid 

chromatograph equipped with a column oven L-2300 and Diode array detector L-2455 

(VWR, USA). The column LiChroCART® 250-4 LiChospher® 100 RP-8 (5 ?m) was 

used. 

The method was already described [2]. It was used an injection volume of 25 ?L with an 

auto injector and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection was carried out between 200 and 

500 nm with a diode array detector. A gradient composed by solutions A (0.05% 

trifluoroacetic acid) and B (methanol) was used according as followed: 0 min, 80% A, 

20% B; 20 min 20% A, 80% B; 25 min, 20% A, 80% B. 

To quantify the chlorogenic acid, cynaroside and cynarin in the extracts obtained during 

the study, calibration curves were made using two different concentrations: 0.5 and 0.1 

mg/mL for chlorogenic acid and cynarin; 0.25 and 0.1 mg/mL for cynaroside.  

3.1.6. Total Phenolic Content with Folin -Ciocalteau Method 

The content of phenolic compounds in the fractions studied was determined according to 

the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure, using pure gallic acid as standard [3]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of gallic 

acid (10, 20, 50, 100, 350 and 500 ?g/ mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution 

without any gallic acid or sample. 

Was added 30 µL of sample, 1350 µL of distilled water and 30 µL of Folin-Ciocalteau 

reagent to an Eppendorf, and then it was subjected to vortex. Next, it rested for 3 minutes 

before adding 90 µL of sodium carbonate, and then it was set in continuous agitation in a 



28 

 

circular agitator at 18 rpm for 2 hours at 4°C. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 

760 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. 

3.1.7. Tannins Content with Prussian Blue  

The content of the tannins in the fractions obtained along the study was determined 

according to the Prussian Blue procedure, using pure tannic acid as standard [4]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of tannic 

acid (10, 20, 40, 60, 100 and 150 ?g/ mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution 

without any tannic acid or sample. 

Were added 50 µL of sample, 150 µL of distilled water, 150 µL of 0.1 M ferric chloride 

(in 0.1 M of HCl) and 150 µL of 0.008 M potassium ferrocyanide to an Eppendorf and 

the absorbance was measured at 605 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. 

3.1.8. Carbohydrates Content Measure 

The content of carbohydrates in the fractions obtained along the study was determined 

with the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay, using monohydrated glucose (dextrose) as 

standard [5]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using six different volumes of glucose 1.5 

mg/mL (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution 

without any glucose or sample. 

Were added 5 mg of sample and 1 mL of 95-97% H2SO4 to a test tube, and then it was 

boiled for 20 minutes. Afterwards, was added to the same tube 1.2 mL of 1M NaOH. The 

mix obtained was subjected to a vacuum filtration with a 70 MM filter and then it was 

placed in a 5 mL volumetric flask, which was make up to the mark with distilled water. 1 

mL was collected from the previous solution and added to an Eppendorf, along with 1 

mL of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and 2 mL of distilled water. This solution was 

boiled again for 5 minutes and then placed in a 25 mL volumetric flask, which was make 

up to the mark with distilled water. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a 

Shimadzu UV-160A. 

To prepare the DNS solution were added 0.5 g of DNS and 0.8 g of NaOH to 25 mL of 

heated distilled water and this process was performed in continuous magnetic agitation 



29 

 

until total dissolution of the compounds added. Afterwards, the solution was left until 

total cooling and then were added 15 g of tartrate and 25 mL of distilled water. 

3.1.9. Protein Content with Bradfor d Method 

The content of proteins in the fractions obtained along the study was determined 

according to the Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard [6]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using six different volumes of BSA (10, 20, 

40, 60, 80 and 100 ?L) and for blank was chosen the same solution without any BSA or 

sample. 

Were added 5 µL of sample, 795 µL of distilled water and 200 µL of Bradford reagent to 

an Eppendorf and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. 

3.1.10. Flavonoid Content 

The content of flavonoids in the fractions obtained along the study was determined using 

a spectrophotometric assay based on aluminium complex formation, using catechin as 

standard [7]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using six different concentrations of catechin 

(10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ?g/mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution without 

any catechin or sample. 

Were added 20 µL of sample, 480 µL of distilled water and 300 µL of NaNO2 (5% w/v) 

to an Eppendorf and the solution was left at room temperature for 5 minutes. Afterwards, 

were added 30 µL of AlCl3 (10% w/v) and another minute was waited before adding 200 

µL of 1M NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 510nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. 

3.1.11. Cytotoxicity and Effects on Membrane Integrity Assays  

The cytotoxicity was evaluated using general cell viability endpoint MTT reduction (3-

(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl- 2H-tetrazolium bromide) and propidium iodide 

exclusion assays [8], [9]. The MTT is a yellow water-soluble tetrazolium dye that is 

reduced to an insoluble-water purple formazan product by living cells. This last product 

when solubilized in an appropriate solvent can be measured spectrophotometrically, 

allowing the indirect determination of surviving number cells when exposed to a sample 

[10]. 



30 

 

Cell viability was assessed after 24h of incubation of a spontaneously immortalized 

human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (CLS, Germany) with different concentrations of 

extracts. This assay required three days. In the first day, HaCaT cells were seeded in 

sterile flat bottom 96 well tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany), in RPMI 1640 culture 

medium (Life Technologies, UK), supplemented with 10% Fetal serum bovine, 100 units 

of penicillin G (sodium salt) and 100 ?g of streptomycin sulfate and 2mM L-glutamine 

(Life Technologies, UK), at a cell density of 2x105 cells/mL 100 microliters per well. 

Cells were incubated at 37° C and 5% CO2. On the second day, the medium was replaced 

by fresh medium and the artichoke extract, the artichoke fraction C or their respective 

formulations were added to six wells per plate. Then, cells were incubated for 24 h, 

negative control was the culture medium and positive control sodium dodecyl sulfate 

(SDS) at 1 mg/mL. In the third day, after the time of exposition, the medium was replaced 

by 0.3 mM propidium iodide in culture medium (stock solution 1.5 mM in DMSO, diluted 

with culture medium 1:5). Fluorescence was measured (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 590 

nm) in microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMGLabtech, Germany), and then, the 

MTT assay was performed. Medium was replaced by medium containing 0.25 mg/mL 

MTT. The cells were incubated again for 3h. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 

the intracellular formazan crystals were solubilized and extracted with 100 µl 

dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). After 15 min in continuous agitation at room temperature 

the absorbance was measured at 570 nm in FLUOstar Omega BMGLabtech Microplate 

Reader. 

The relative cell viability (%) compared to control cells was calculated for the MTT assay 

using the following equation: 

% cell viability = 
??? ??????

??? ???????
× 100 

Where Abssample is the absorbance measured for cells treated with artichoke extract or 

artichoke fraction C formulations and Abscontrol is the absorbance value obtained for cells 

incubated with culture medium in the cases of extracts and the absorbance values obtained 

for cells incubated with its blank in the cases of topical formulations, both measured at 

570 nm.

where Fluorescencesample is the relative fluorescence unit (URF) values obtained for cells 

treated with desired samples and Fluorescencecontrol is the URF values obtained for cells 

incubated with culture medium in the case of extracts and URF values obtained for cells 

incubated with its blank in the case of topical formulations. 

3.1.12. Antioxidant Activity 

3.1.12.1. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay  

The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used for determination of free 

radical-scavenging activity of the fractions, and the standard utilized was ascorbic acid 

[11]. DPPH is a stable free radical characterized by an unpaired valence electron at one 

atom of nitrogen bridge which bears a deep purple color, and when it’s neutralized 

becomes colorless or pale yellow. This method is based on measurement of the loss of 

DPPH color at 517 nm after reaction with samples [12]. 

The calibration standard curve was obtained using four different concentrations of the 

fraction tested (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL) and for blank was chosen the same solution 

without any sample. Was added 1 mL of DPPH solution and 10 µL of sample to an 

Eppendorf and it was placed for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then the absorbance 

was measured at 517 nm in a Shimadzu UV-160A. 

The DPPH solution was prepared using 2 mg of pure DPPH and 100 mL of methanol. 

The percentages of inhibition of the DPPH free radical were calculated through the 

following equation:  

% of inhibition = 100 ? (
??

??
? 100) 

Where Af is the absorbance measured for the fraction and Ab is the absorbance measured 

for the blank. Were realized three independent experiments and the results obtained are 

expressed as mean ± standard deviation. To calculate the half maximal effective 

concentration (EC50), which is required to scavenge 50% of DPPH free radicals, two 

approaches were adopted depending on the antioxidant profile observed. A linear 



32 

 

regression was opted for all fractions, with exception of artichoke extract. For this 

fraction, the EC50 value was obtained directly from the profile % of inhibition-

concentration obtained. 

3.1.12.2. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production 

Measurement 

The intracellular ROS production can be evaluated through a fluorimeter technique that 

uses 2,7’ dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA, Life Technologies, UK). 

This molecule non-fluorescent is hydrolyzed to 2-7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein 

(H2DCF), another non-fluorescent molecule, by the action of intracellular esterases. 

H2DCF is rapidly oxidized to a highly fluorescent compound (DCF) [13]–[15] in the 

presence of H2O2, hydroxyl radicals and several peroxides [16].  

In this assay were used HaCaT sub-confluent cells grown in 96 well plates, which were 

incubated for 30 minutes with 20 ?M of H2-DCFDA in dark at 37°C. Later, the medium 

was removed and fresh medium was added to the cells before being exposed to different 

concentrations of extracts and ascorbic acid or topical formulations containing the 

extracts for 1 hour. In the case of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), it was added 

simultaneously with the samples in study. For the UV assay, three UV-B lamps (Sankyo 

Denki G8T5E, Kanagawa, Japan) with a peak emission at 312 nm were used as the UV-

B source, and measured with a VLX 312 radiometer equipped with a UV-B sensor (Vilber 

Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée Cedex, France). The cells with the extracts or the topical 

formulations were irradiated with a UV-B single dose of 26 mJ/cm2 for 15 minutes. 

Afterwards, the ROS levels were determined at excitation 485 nm and emission 520 nm 

wavelengths using a florescence microplate reader (FLUOstar BMGLabtech, Germany) 

[17]. Data collected from at least 5 replicates is expressed as percentage of reduction of 

ROS. 

3.1.13. In vitro SPF determination 

All natural fractions, including artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and green coffee 

oil, were accurately weighed (0.25 g), diluted with ethanol:water solution (1:1), followed 

by ultrasonication for 5 min and filtered through filter paper (WhatmanTM 42). The 

absorption spectra of samples solution were obtained in the range of 290 to 320 nm 

(Hitachi U-2001, USA) every 5 nm, using a standard 1 cm quartz cell, and ethanol:water 



33 

 

solution as the blank reagent. Triplicates were made, followed by the application of the 

Mansur equation: 

 

SPFspectrophotometric = CF x? ??
320
290  (?) x I (?) x Abs (?) 

 

where EE (?) is the erythemal effect spectrum; I (?) is the solar intensity spectrum; Abs 

(?) is the absorbance of sunscreen product and CF is the correction factor (=10) [18]. The 

values of EE x I are constants determined by Sayre [19]. 

 

3.2. Topical Formulations Development  

3.2.1. Preparation of an emulsion and a hydrogel 

The emulsion was prepared through the combination of different ingredients, being the 

final formulation recipe in Table 3.1. Parabens sodium salts changed the emulsions colors 

to pale green, instead of pale beige, so in order get more stable formulations, parabens 

with no sodium were chosen. In total, three emulsions were prepared: blank cream (BC), 

cream containing artichoke extract (AC) and cream containing artichoke fraction C (CC).

The process to prepared the emulsion involved the following steps: 

I. Adding the oily compounds (polyglyceryl-3 dicitrate/stearate, cetearyl alcohol, 

liquid paraffin, decyl oleate and almond oil) to a bowl and the non-oily compounds 

(glycerin and 70% of the purified water) to another bowl and place both bowls in a 

water bath at 70-80°C until total homogenization; 

II. Dissolving the extract in the remain purified water (around 30%) and reserve it; 

III. Verting the oily ingredients to the bowl containing the non-oily ingredients; 

IV. Taking the mix to ultra-turrax during 2-3 minutes; 

V. Adding the parabens to the mix while it is still warm; 

VI. Stirring the mix until it’s cold; 

VII. Adding the dissolved extract and then agitating the mix until it is homogeneous.  

 

The ingredients used to prepare the hydrogel are shown in Table 3.2. The polymer chosen 

to prepare the hydrogel was a carbomer, Carbopol 940®, which is a cross-linked 

polyacrylate polymer, that confers high viscosity, high suspending ability and high clarity 

to the formulation. The preservatives chosen were methyl and propyl parabens with no 

sodium. In total, three gels were prepared: blank gel (BG), gel containing artichoke 

extract (AG) and gel containing artichoke fraction C (CG).

II. Dissolving the extract in the remain purified water and reserve it; 



35 

 

III. Adding the dissolved extract to the bowl; 

IV. Leaving the mix for 30 minutes at room temperature; 

V. Taking the mix to ultra-turrax during 2-3 minutes; 

VI. Adding sodium hydroxide to the mix until it gained the desired consistency. 

 

A blank for each formulation were also prepared to be used as control standards in the 

assays using the emulsions and gels.  

 

3.2.2. Formulations Rheology  

All formulations prepared, including their blanks, were analysed relatively to its 

consistency. Therefore, its viscosity was measured with a rotational digital viscometer 

Brookfield DV II and small sample adapter (SSA) – Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, 

EUA. The viscosity of the two formulations prepared, emulsion and hydrogel, were very 

distinct, so two spindles were used. For the emulsions was used the spindle nº 27 and for 

the hydrogels the spindle nº 7. Approximately 25 mL of formulation were placed in the 

recipient of the viscometer, and it was subdued to a continuous shear rate sweep (from 

0,6 to 122 s-1), keeping each shear rate for 15 seconds. 

3.2.3. pH Measurement 

The pH of each formulation were measured with the pH meter InoLab 730 WTW, at room 

temperature. At least three measures were performed for each emulsion and each gel, and 

the data were collected after stabilization of value on the equipment. 

3.2.4. Microbiological Control 

The microbiological stability assessment was performed according to the ISO 

16212:2008, ISO 21149:2006 and ISO 21148:2005 [20]–[22]. 

 

3.3. In Vivo Studies Analysis  

3.3.1. Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT)  

Marzully and Maibach HRIPT protocol [23] was used to performed a safety evaluation. 

For this study were chosen 50 healthy volunteers that were informed about the procedure 

and had signed the informed written consent. Volunteers with dermatological or other 



36 

 

medical or physical problems, and pregnant and nursing women were excluded from the 

study. The induction period of a possible allergic response lasted three weeks, in which a 

series of 9 patches (Finn Chamber standard) were performed. Each occlusive patch 

contained 20 mg of the formulation and was applied on the left side of the back. After 48 

hours, the patch was removed and was performed a skin evaluation, which was followed 

by the application of a new patch. Reactions after patching were measured according to 

the recommendations of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group [24]. 

Induction period was followed by a two weeks’ rest period, in which wasn’t applied the 

tested product. Afterwards, challenge period started and new patches were applied again 

in the same way as in the induction period, but this time were applied in the right side of 

the back. After a period of 48 hours the patches were removed and skin evaluations were 

realized to observe possible skin reactions at 48, 72 and 96 hours after patching using 

again the score method recommended by the International Contact Dermatitis Research 

Group.  

This protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee and respected the Helsinki 

Declaration and the AFSSAPS regulations on performed HRIPT studies on cosmetic 

products. This study was supervised by a dermatologist who participated in the skin 

evaluations in order to observe possible irritation/allergic reactions to the tested 

formulations. 

 

3.3.2. Assessment of the protective ef fect against oxidative stress 

after UV radiation by chromameter evaluation  

In the first day, three patches were applied in the forearm area (left or right) in each 

volunteer, two contained the formulations and the other one was the control, in which no 

product was applied. The patches remained 24 hours, and after this period, a solution of 

?-carotene was applied in the same area of the forearm. A negative control area with only 

?-carotene was also used. After 15 min of ?-carotene application, the color was measured 

in all the areas. The areas were then irradiated with a UVA lamp and the color was 

measured again. A Minolta Chromameter CR-400 (Minolta, Japan) was used to obtain 

the b* color. The same area was evaluated at the first day (D0) and then after 28 days 

(D28) using the same procedure. Between D0 and D28, the volunteers applied the topical 

products in the areas indicated by the principal investigator. 



37 

 

 

3.4. Statistical Analysis  

Data was expressed as mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) of experiments. 

Statistical evaluation of data was performed using one-way analysis of variance 

(ANOVA). Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test (GraphPad PRISM 7® software, 

USA), was used to compare the significance of the difference between the groups, a P 

&lt;0.05 was accepted as significant.

4. Results and Discussion 
4.1. Artichoke Extract  

The artichoke extract was chosen to be the main subject in this study due to its antioxidant 

properties and it was obtained through an infusion, followed by a lyophilization. Its 

chromatogram is showed in Figure 4.1. 

 

4.2. Purification of Artichoke Extract  

In order to purify the artichoke extract and to improve its properties, including antioxidant 

activity, two different purification approaches were addopted: an acidic digestion with 

gastric juice followed by a 24 hours dialysis, and a mucilage precipitation method. In this 

last one, the importance of acetic acid in the procedure was also investigated. The 

purification schematics is presented in Figure 4.2.

4.2.1. Acidic Digestion &amp;amp; Dialysis (Artichoke Fraction A)  

Tea infusions when ingested are exposed to gastric juice, and consequently to a complex 

system of enzymes and to a highly acidic pH (1.0-2.5) [1]. Pepsin is one of those enzymes 

and its optimum pH range is 1.5-2.5, which means that it has its maximum activity inside 

the stomach [2]. It can cleave the linkages between mucilage and phenolic compounds, 

enhancing the extraction of polyphenols from the artichoke extract during dialysis. 

Therefore, in order to maximize the extraction of polyphenols compounds from the 

artichoke extract, a dialysis with a previous acidic digestion of artichoke extract was 

made.  

To follow the progress of dialysis, aliquots of the permeate were collected along the assay. 

The permeate – the outer water where the retentate is placed - was exchanged three times 

to avoid saturation (3, 6 and 22 hour), which would probably slow down the polyphenols 

extraction. Over time was observed a change of coloration in the permeate, being the 

earlier samples colorless and the latest pale brown. This indicated that probably there was 

occurring an extraction from the artichoke extract to the permeate. This purified fraction 

will be called Artichoke Fraction A. 

Phenolic compounds present in each aliquot were measured through a well-established 

method of polyphenols quantification. It’s important to mention that the outer waters were 

exchanged after the hour 3, 6 and 22, so the values present in  

Figure 4.2 - Scheme of the purification strategies adopted to purify the artichoke extract.

Table 4.1 were not cumulative in the water. The maximum polyphenols mass was 

extracted after three hours of dialysis, meaning that a considerable quantity of 

polyphenols present in the artichoke extract were transferred from inside the dialysis 

membrane to the permeate in the first hours. In the following hours of dialysis, the rate 

of extraction decreased substantially, for example the mass of polyphenols extracted in 

16 hours – between the collection of the samples of hours 6 and 22 – was only 72 µg ( 

Table 4.1; Figure 4.3). The total polyphenols extracted during this process was the sum 

of all polyphenols present in the outer waters collected along the process (hours 3, 6, 22 

and 24).

The HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the artichoke extract and the retentate – part of the 

extract that does not pass through the dialysis membrane – showed the presence of the 

same compounds in both fractions, since there are traces of every compound present in 

the artichoke extract in the retentate chromatogram (Figure 4.4). The same occurred in 

the HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the retentate and the artichoke fraction A (Figure 4.5).

A control sample constituted by 50% water and 50% gastric juice was analyzed by HPLC-

DAD in order to compare with the rest of the chromatograms obtained from dialysis 

samples. In Figure 4.6, the retentate and digested artichoke extract (artichoke extract after 

the acidic digestion with gastric juice) chromatograms showed a peak at minute 25.2 that 

didn’t exist in the artichoke extract spectrum. However, this peak was also present in the 

control chromatogram, which suggests that it corresponds to the pepsin enzyme. This 

implies that the enzyme is not transferred from the retentate to the artichoke fraction A 

through the dialysis membrane, which complies with pepsin molecular weight (? 36 000 

Da) and the molecular weight cutoff of the membrane pores (10 000 Da).

4.2.2. Mucilage Precipitation (Art ichoke Fractions B and C)  

Previous studies demonstrated the potential of polyphenolic-polysaccharide 

glycoconjugates isolated from medicinal plants of Asteraceae family as antioxidants, 

once they exhibited the capacity to protect proteins and lipids present in human plasma 

against oxidative stress caused by ?-radiation [3]. However, Kim et al. [4] showed that 

mucilage removal through an enzymatic hydrolysis from cactus cladodes resulted in an 

increase of phenolic compounds in the extract, and consequently in the improvement of 

its radical scavenging activity. Therefore, in order to remove the mucilage present in the

artichoke extract, a method found in literature was used [5]. This method had as purpose 

the improvement of the phenolic content of artichoke extract and consequently, its 

antioxidant activity. 

Initially, it was tested whether the presence of acetic acid affected the mucilage 

precipitation of the artichoke extract, in terms of phenolic compounds and antioxidant 

activity. Both assays were realized, one using acetic acid and the other without acetic 

acid, remaining the rest of the procedure equal. The supernatant obtained from the method 

using acetic acid will be called Artichoke Fraction B and the supernatant from the method 

without acetic acid will be named Artichoke Fraction C.  

 

4.3. Extracts Chemical Analysis  

4.3.1. Artichoke Extract 

4.3.1.1. HPLC-DAD Analysis 

Previous studies showed the presence of chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid), cynarin 

(1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and cynaroside (luteolin-7-O-glucoside) in the artichoke 

extract [6]. Therefore, in order to investigate the presence of these compounds in the 

artichoke infusion previously prepared, a HPLC-DAD analysis was performed, being the 

chromatogram obtained in Figure 4.7.  

The retention times of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside were approximately 7.38, 

12.4 and 12.65 min, respectively. So, the peak 1 indicated in Figure 4.7 corresponds to 

chlorogenic acid, the peak 2 to cynarin and the peak 3 to cynaroside.  



46 

 

Figure 4.7 – Example of chromatogram of artichoke infusion (1mg/mL). 

 

To measure these antioxidants in the artichoke infusion were performed several HPLC-

DAD analyses of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside with well-known 

concentrations to create HPLC-DAD calibration curves, being the results in Table 4.2. 

Cynarin showed to be the most abundant antioxidant in the artichoke extract with 

aproximally 83 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract, and chlorogenic acid revealed to be also in 

high levels with aproximally 56 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract. This outcome is in accord 

with the literature, where chlorogenic acid and cynarin are showed to be the mainly 

compounds of Cynara C. Scolymus [7]. The flavone cynaroside is present in a smaller 

amount when compared with the two caffeoylquinic acids, with only 7 ?g/mg of artichoke 

extract. Therefore, artichoke extract showed to be rich in phenolic compounds and 

flavones, which can explain its antioxidant activity.

4.3.1.2. McCleary Method  

In the mucilage precipitation method was observed a smaller amount of precipitate than 

it was expected, so was also realized the McCleary method. This method consists in two 

successive enzymatic digestions, the first with gastric juice and the second with pancreatic 

juice, and it was used to quantify the total dietary fibers present in the artichoke extract 

in order to characterize it. The artichoke fraction C was used in the beginning of this 

method. Its schematic is represented in Figure 4.8.  

Figure 4.8 - Scheme of the McCleary method. 

 

In order to follow the process, aliquots of the supernatants and precipitate formed were 

collected and posteriorly analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The chromatograms of the artichoke 

fraction C and the supernatants obtain during this method are represented in Figure 4.9, 

and some differences are spotted between them, like the peaks intensities as well as the 

appearing of new peaks and the disappearing of old ones. These results suggest that during 

the process, and due to the digestions by gastric and pancreatic juices, there are alterations 

in the artichoke extract, which are expected to lead to a more purified extract.  

 

 

 



48 

 

 

In the gastric juice digestion realized in the first purification method, dialysis, was 

observed the formation of a thin brown layer inside the dialysis membrane containing the 

artichoke extract, just like the layer observed also in the previous mucilage precipitation 

method, which means that the digestion of the extract using gastric juice results in the 

precipitation of mucilage. However, in this method, after the gastric juice digestion, 

wasn’t observed any layer and consequently, wasn’t formed any precipitate. This could 

be due to the previous mucilage precipitation method that resulted in the artichoke 

fraction C, which perhaps precipitated the all mucilage susceptible to the gastric juice 

enzymes. A closer look in the chromatograms of the artichoke fraction C and the 

supernatant SA, represented in Figure 4.10, shows that there are no significant differences 

between them, with exception of the peaks intensities. Therefore, this digestion didn’t 

affect the composition of the artichoke extract but according with the results showed in 

Table 4.3, there was an increase in the total content of phenolic compounds in the SA 

supernatant when compared with the content of the artichoke fraction C.

The chromatograms of the SA and SB supernatants shown in Figure 4.11 have some 

differences between them, including the appearing of the peak 1 and the nearly 

disappearing of the peak 2 in the SB chromatogram. These alterations are probably due 

to the pancreatic digestion, which results in the alteration of the artichoke extract 

composition. Bouayed et al. [8] studied the influence of intestinal digestion, which 

includes pancreatic juice, in the polyphenols of selected apple varieties. Changes in the 

polyphenolic profiles during intestinal digestion were observed and a considerable loss 

of polyphenols occurred. Another study reported the change of polyphenols after 

pancreatic digestion, which was traduced by the decrease of anthocyanins, flavonols, 

flavan-3-ols and neochlorogenic acid, and the increase of chlorogenic acid [9]. However, 

in this study was observed a slightly increase of total phenols after gastric and pancreatic 

digestion, being the results in Table 4.3.

The HPLC-DAD analysis of the SB supernatant, the precipitate formed and the pancreatic 

juice, which chromatograms are presented in Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13, suggests that 

a fraction of the pancreatic juice remained in the supernatant and another fraction 

precipitated with the mucilage. The peak 1 market in Figure 4.12, already marked before 

in the Figure 4.11, appears in the SB supernatant and in the pancreatic juice, but not in 

the SA supernatant, which indicates that this peak corresponds to a compound of the 

pancreatic juice, meaning that a part of it remained in the supernatant. On the other hand, 

the peaks 1 and 2 market in Figure 4.13 represent the compounds present either in the 

precipitate or in the pancreatic juice, indicating that a fraction of the pancreatic juice 

precipitates along with the mucilage. The precipitation of pancreatic juice compounds can 

possible be explained by the interactions between proteins and polysaccharides through 

an electrostatic complex or micellar structures formation [10], which perhaps are 

responsible for dragging the enzymes present in the solution, like pepsin and pancreatin, 

along with the polysaccharides.

The precipitate formed in the last step of this method had a total mass of 18.2 mg. But to 

assume that all of it corresponds only to mucilage, a calculation of the mass of pancreatic 

juice present in it was needed. The peaks 1 and 2 of the precipitate chromatogram market

the total mass of the precipitate obtained, 17.1 mg corresponds to dietary fibers. 

Combining this result with the previous result of the mucilage precipitation method 

applied before to the artichoke fraction C (13.7 ± 2.1 %), the artichoke extract has 62.8 ± 

1.9 % of mucilage. 

Also, the precipitate formed had a low solubility, and not even with sonication and 

vortexing methods was possible to dissolve it in distilled water, which suggests that the 

majority of the precipitate obtained from the McCleary method were insoluble dietary 

fibers. 

  

4.3.1.3. Global composition 

The artichoke is a higher plant, which means that its cells walls are made up of 

aproximally 90% carbohydrates and 10% proteins, and it has in its constitution phenolic 

compounds and dietary fibers as well [11], [12]. Therefore, carbohydrates, proteins, 

polyphenols and soluble and insoluble fibers were measure in the artichoke extract to 

proceed to its characterization, being the results in Table 4.4. A total of 66.7% of the 

artichoke extract was characterized, being the soluble and insoluble fibers the most 

abundant compound of the Cynara C. var. Scolymus infusion, corresponding to 62.8% of 

it. The content of proteins showed to be the lowest, only 0.002%, which can be a result 

of the thermal process involved in the preparation of the artichoke infusion. Other studies, 

also reported a decrease of protein levels in vegetables after being boiled [13]. The levels 

of carbohydrates and phenolic compounds correspond to 0.82% and 3.06% of the 

artichoke extract, respectively.  

Table 4.4 - Quantity of carbohydrates, proteins, phenols and soluble and insoluble fibers present in a total of 80 mg of 

artichoke extract. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 3 replicates experiments.

Petacci et al. [14] quantified the polyphenols content of 12 Asteraceae species, including

and Echinocoryne Holosericea, and their polyphenols content ranged between 32.65 ± 

0.70 and 147.97 ± 2.66 mg per 100 g of extract. On the other side, in this study the Cynara 

Cardunculus Scolymus, specie also from the Asteraceae family, showed 306 mg per 100g 

of extract, being a richer source of polyphenols.  

 

4.3.2. Artichoke Fraction A 

To evaluate the efficiency of polyphenols extraction from artichoke extract to the 

Artichoke Fraction A, samples of retentate and artichoke fraction A were collected before 

and after dialysis in order to perform a few quantifications. 

Analysis of the total phenols and tannins in all fractions showed that dialysis managed to 

extract phenols and tannins from the inside of tubing dialysis to the artichoke fraction A, 

being the results in Table 4.5.  

Table 4.5 - Concentration of total phenols and tannins in artichoke extract, digested artichoke extract before dialysis 

and in the retentate and artichoke fraction A after dialysis. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 3

Previous studies using chokeberry reported no substantial effect caused by gastric 

digestion on any of the major phenolic compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonols, 

flavan-3-ols and caffeic acid derivatives [9]. However, in this study was observed a 

decrease of polyphenols concentration present in the artichoke extract from 31 ± 1.0 to 

16 ± 5 µg/mg of artichoke extract after the gastric digestion. Bouayed et al. [8] also 

reported a decrease of polyphenols in four apple varieties after gastric digestion when 

compared with their original content. Polyphenols and proteins, including enzymes like 

pepsin, can be bonded through reversible or irreversible non-covalent interactions, such 

as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and ionic interactions [15]. Therefore, the decrease 

observed may be due to these interactions.  

Afterwards, in the dialysis process was observed a decrease of polyphenols and tannins 

concentration in the retentate compared to the initial levels in the digested artichoke

0.001 to 0.002 ± 0.0003 µg/mg of artichoke extract in tannins), and the opposite occurred 

in the artichoke fraction A, which levels increased (from 0 to 35 ± 10 µg/mg of artichoke 

extract in total phenols and to 0.03 µg/mg of artichoke extract in tannins). Notice that the 

levels of phenols and tannins are higher in artichoke fraction A than in the digested 

artichoke extract, suggesting that the interaction between polyphenols and proteins, such 

as pepsin, was reversible. The same happened between artichoke fraction A and artichoke 

extract, which suggests that a purification occurred, increasing polyphenols values per 

mg of artichoke extract. 

A quantification of chlorogenic acid, cynaroside and cynarin in the artichoke extract, 

digested artichoke extract, retentate and artichoke fraction A was also performed. These 

results are shown in Table 4.6. After acidic digestion, a decrease of chlorogenic acid and 

cynarin in the artichoke extract occurred, from 56 to 48 µg/mg of extract and from 83 to 

40 µg/mg of extract, respectively. On the other hand, an increase of cynaroside 

concentration was observed, from 7 to 33 µg/mg of extract. After dialysis, was observed 

a decrease of all components between the digested artichoke extract and the retentate, 

from 48 to 15 µg/mg of extract in chlorogenic acid, 33 to 3 µg/mg of extract in cynaroside 

and 40 to 28 µg/mg of extract in cynarin, which suggested that the transferring of these 

compounds occurred to the artichoke fraction A. This can be confirmed through the 

comparison of their values between the retentate and the artichoke fraction A, once 

occurred an increase of all in artichoke fraction A. 

Table 4.6 - Concentration of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and luteolin in digested artichoke extract before dialysis and in 

the retentate and artichoke fraction A after dialysis. 

 

Considering all results obtained, presented in Table 4.5 and Table 4.6, it is possible to 

conclude that this method was able to extract polyphenols, including chlorogenic acid, 

cynarin and cynaroside, from the artichoke infusion, which resulted in a purified fraction 

(artichoke fraction A).

The artichoke fraction A was lyophilized and a total mass of 572.8 mg was recuperated, 

but according to calculations, only 1.32 mg of polyphenols and tannins were extracted to 

this fraction. Therefore, the dialysis tubing allowed other artichoke compounds to pass to 

the permeate besides the polyphenols. These may be polysaccharides, so a mucilage 

quantification was performed and the results demonstrate that 22% of the lyophilized 

artichoke fraction A was mucilage. The same analysis was made for the lyophilized 

retentate and it showed that 33% were mucilage. The existence of mucilage inside and 

outside of the tubing dialysis probably happens due to size variances of the 

polysaccharides, being the molecular weight cutoff of 10 000 Da, meaning that only the 

molecules with a smaller size than 10 000 Da can pass through the pores to the artichoke 

fraction A. 

Initially were added 550 mg of artichoke extract, 35 mg of pepsin and 22 mg of sodium 

chloride, these last ones were part of gastric juice, to the dialysis membrane, resulting in 

a total mass of 607 mg. However, 43.6 mg of retentate and 572.8 mg of artichoke fraction 

A were recuperated after lyophilization, which equals 616 mg. Comparison of the initial 

mass with the recuperated showed a discrepancy of 9 mg. Lyophilization results in the 

absorption of 5-10% (w/w) of water by the dried mixture, so this difference observed 

maybe was due to its water content that wasn’t lyophilized [16].  

 

4.3.3. Artichoke Fraction B and C 

As showed in Figure 4.14, the chromatograms of both supernatants, are very similar, 

being only notable a slight difference within the peaks intensities. The same happened 

with the precipitates chromatograms as it is possible to observe in Figure 4.15. Therefore, 

the absence of acetic acid in the method used to precipitate the mucilage present in the 

artichoke extract doesn’t affect the composition of the supernatant and the precipitate.

doesn’t prevent the precipitation of these compounds along with the polysaccharides and 

proteins present in the mucilage.

The acetic acid in this method is commonly used to free the polysaccharides from the 

salts and to recover them by precipitation through the addition of ethanol. However, the 

results obtained from both chromatograms, from total phenols and tannins quantification 

and from the quantification of selected polyphenols, showed no differences between 

artichoke fractions B and C obtained from both mucilage precipitation methods, with and 

without acetic acid. Considering these results and taking into account the purpose of these 

compounds and their costs of production, the artichoke fraction C was the fraction that 

appeared to have more potential. Therefore, this fraction was studied more deeply.  

In order to analyze the separation of the artichoke compounds by the mucilage 

precipitation method with no use of acetic acid, an analysis of the artichoke fraction C 

and the precipitate obtained from this procedure was performed by HPLC-DAD. In the 

chromatograms of Figure 4.16, the differences between the supernatant and the 



58 

 

precipitate obtained from this purification process are observed. Through a meticulous 

analysis, it’s possible to spot the same peaks in both chromatograms, which means that 

artichoke extract compounds were dragged along with the mucilage, resulting in their 

precipitation too. 

 

In Table 4.9 is shown the quantification of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside in 

the artichoke fraction C and its precipitate. Artichoke fraction C retained most of the 

selected polyphenols during the mucilage precipitation (68 µg/mg of extract of 

chlorogenic acid; 83 µg/mg of extract of cynarin; and 18 µg/mg of extract of cynaroside), 

while its precipitate dragged along a small fraction of those polyphenols during 

precipitation (9 µg/mg of extract of chlorogenic acid; 16 µg/mg of extract of cynarin; and 

0.7 µg/mg of extract of cynaroside). The polyphenols precipitation may be due to the 

interactions between polyphenols and polysaccharides, which bond them forcing the 

polyphenols to precipitate along with the polysaccharides [17].

The boiling point of ethanol is 78ºC [18], which is lower than the water boiling point 

(100ºC), so a strategy to eliminate the ethanol present in the supernatant through a 

washing process by a rotary evaporator was adopted, and a HPLC-DAD analysis of 

washed and unwashed artichoke fractions C was made to assure that this process wouldn’t 

change their composition, being the results in Figure 4.17. The chromatograms of both 

fractions are identical, having only different peaks intensities. Thus, the washing process 

didn’t affect the compounds present in the supernatants, being safe to use. 

Figure 4.17 - HPLC-DAD analysis of the artichoke fraction C washed and unwashed. 

 

A quantification of the total phenols present in the artichoke fraction C before and after 

this process was also done. As showed in Table 4.10, there was a loss of total phenols due 

to this process, but according to an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the difference isn’t 

significant (p-value &gt; 0.05). Thus, the washed artichoke fraction C will be used in the 

following studies.

4.4. Antioxidant Activities:  DPPH Assays 

4.4.1. Artichoke Extract 

The effect of the artichoke extract in terms of the DPPH radical scavenging activity is 

represented in Figure 4.18. During the assay, the colors alterations between samples with 

different artichoke infusion concentrations were visible, implying the existence of 

antioxidant activity. The artichoke extract showed a clear dose-response scavenging 

effect on the free radical DPPH with a singular pattern. The antioxidant activity of 

artichoke extract obtained through DPPH method, expressed as the half maximal effective 

concentration (EC50), was 99 ± 29 µg/mL. Falé et al. [6] obtained an EC50 of 123.1 ± 5.7, 

which is higher than the result obtained in this study. 

Figure 4.18 - Antioxidant activity of artichoke extract. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 3 replicates 
experiments. 

 

4.4.2. Artichoke Fraction A 

Artichoke Fraction A showed a clear dose-response scavenging effect on the free radical 

DPPH, indicating an antioxidant capacity, being the results in Figure 4.19. The 

antioxidant activity, expressed as the quantity of extract necessary to decrease the initial 

DPPH radical concentration by 50% (EC50), obtained for the artichoke fraction A was 95 

± 1.5 µg/mL. Due to the percentage stabilization, the value of antioxidant activity was 

taken directly from the graphic instead of the trendline equation.

In Table 4.11 are the results for the artichoke fractions B and C antioxidant activities, and 

as it shows, the purify fraction with the best antioxidant activity was the artichoke fraction 

C (56 ± 6 µg/ mL) (Figure 4.20), while the artichoke fraction B had a poorer antiradicalar 

activity (67 ± 6 µg/ mL) (Figure 4.21).

4.4.4. Ascorbic Acid 

Ascorbic acid was chosen as the antioxidant reference for this test, so it was needed to 

perform a DPPH assay with this antiradicalar compound. In Figure 4.22 is represented 

the antioxidant activity of the ascorbic acid, which EC50 obtained was 2.8 ± 0,1 µg/ mL, 

which is similar to the results of other studies [21], [22].

The antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid is the highest when compared with the results of 

the artichoke extract and the fractions obtained from purification methods (Figure 4.23). 

However, the ascorbic acid is a pure compound, while the artichoke extract and the 

fractions are complex mixtures of several components.  

 

 

4.5. Discussion 

Overall, both methods tested to purify the artichoke extract in order to potentiate its 

capacities, dialysis and mucilage precipitation method without the use of acetic acid, were 

successful, being the results in Table 4.12.  

Table 4.12 - Total content of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside in the artichoke extract, artichoke fraction A 

obtained from dialysis and artichoke fraction C obtained from the mucilage precipitation method with no use of acetic 

acid, and their antioxidant activity. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 3 replicates experiments.

The polyphenolic content of artichoke extract increased after the acidic digestion and 

dialysis (31 ± 1 to 35 ± 10 µg/mg of extract), and decreased after the mucilage 

precipitation (31 ± 1 to 27 ± 2.1 and 23 ± 2.4 µg/mg in the case of the assays using and 

not using acetic acid, respectively). After dialysis, was observed a decrease of chlorogenic 

acid and cynarin after acidic digestion and dialysis, from 56 to 42 µg/mg of extract and 

from 83 to 71 µg/mg of extract respectively, while cynaroside concentration was 

maintained (7 µg/mg of extract). After mucilage precipitation, almost all compounds 

suffered an increase in the artichoke fractions B and C comparing with their original 

content in artichoke extract (from 56 to 63 and 68 µg/mg of extract in chlorogenic acid; 

from 83 to 82 and 83 µg/mg of extract in cynarin; and from 7 to 14 and 18 µg/mg in 

extract of cynaroside). In the three cases, the antioxidant activity improved from 99 

µg/mL (artichoke extract) to 95 µg/mL in the artichoke fraction A resulted from dialysis, 

and to 67 and 56 µg/mL in the artichoke fractions B and C, respectively, obtained from 

the mucilage precipitation method.  

Observing the results of  Table 4.12, the mucilage precipitation method with no use of 

acetic acid appears to be more effective in improving the artichoke extract antioxidant 

activity. It was able to increase the antioxidant capacity over 40%. Therefore, the 

artichoke fraction C was the purified fraction chosen to continue the study and to be 

incorporated in the topical formulations.  

 

4.6. Extracts Cytotoxicity 

Cell-based assays are used to determine if a compound has effect on cell proliferation or 

direct effects that lead to cell death. In order to study the artichoke extract and the 

artichoke fraction C cytotoxicity, the MTT assay was performed using HaCaT cells, a 

spontaneously immortalize human keratinocyte cell line. In the MTT assay, the viable 

cells with active metabolism are capable of converting the MTT into a purple compound, 

the formazan, while the dead cells are incapable of converting it, which allows the 

quantification of viable cells [19]. The results of this assay are shown in Figure 4.24. 

 

 



65 

 

Figure 4.24 - Cytotoxicity of artichoke extract (black bar) and artichoke fraction C (square bar) (1 mg/mL). SDS 

(sodium dodecyl sulfate) (dots bar)) was used as positive control and the medium as negative control (horizontal risks 

bar). The data are presented as the mean ± SD of 6 replicates experiments. 

 

Artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C showed a cell viability of 18.3% and 21.3% 

respectively, while SDS showed 4.6% and the medium 100%. Both fractions showed 

cytotoxicity and significant differences (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) according to an analysis of 

variance (ANOVA), when compared with the medium (negative control) and the SDS 

(positive control). However, the HaCaT cell lines are more sensible than actually skin, 

since skin has a functional barrier that prevents the total absorption of these compounds 

when applied to skin. The rate-limiting barrier to the absorption of topical cosmetics is 

the stratum corneum, due to its length, which comprehends the number of cell layers, the 

thickness, the cell size and the difficulty of this pathway that the substances have to cross 

[20]. 

The EC50 of each fraction was also determined, being the results in Table 4.13. The 

artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed a cytotoxicity of 173 ± 1 mg/mL 

and 218 ± 1 mg/mL, respectively. Meaning that the artichoke fraction C is the fraction 

less toxic when in contact with HaCaT cells.

4.7. Antioxidant Activities: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) 

scavenging activity 

The anti-radicalar activity of the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C was tested 

in HaCaT cells exposed to H2O2. As a preliminary assay, it was tested whether the order 

of application in cells, samples 30 minutes before H2O2 or simultaneously, affected the 

response of ROS production by the cells. As showed in Figure 4.25, the application order 

doesn’t affect the production of ROS by the cells, once there are no significant differences 

between the same samples applied before or simultaneously with the hydrogen peroxide. 

Therefore, it was decided to apply the fractions and the hydrogen peroxide 

simultaneously.  

 

In order to study the ROS scavenging effect on the artichoke extract and the artichoke 

fraction C, the ascorbic acid was once again chosen as the antioxidant reference. As 

showed in Figure 4.26, both fractions revealed ROS scavenging activity when exposed to 

H2O2, a chemical compound responsible for inducing oxidative stress, at concentration of 

1 mg/mL. In the assays were the H2O2 was placed 30 minutes before the samples, 

artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and ascorbic acid showed a 93.3, 94.1 and 96.3 % 

of reduction of ROS, respectively. When the H2O2 was applied simultaneously with the 

samples, the ascorbic acid showed again the highest percentage of reduction of ROS with 

94.9%, and the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 92.5 and 93.1%, 

respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the two fractions

with the ascorbic acid, and the results showed significant differences in both cases (p-

value &amp;lt;0.05). This analysis also showed significant differences between both fractions 

(p-value &amp;lt;0.05).

as the mean ± SD of at least 10 replicates experiments. 

 

Another assay was performed, in this case was used UVB radiation, a physical inducer of 

antioxidant stress, being the results in Figure 4.27. The artichoke extract and the artichoke 

fraction C showed 92.8 and 94.2% of reduction of ROS, while ascorbic acid showed 

95.7%. In this case, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) didn’t revealed any significant 

difference (p-value &gt; 0.05) between the fractions and the ascorbic acid, and between both 

fractions.

was used as a negative control. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 5 replicates experiments. 

 
Taking into account the previous assays, the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction 

C have powerful ROS scavenging effects, once their results are very similar with the ones 

obtained for the ascorbic acid, a well-known antioxidant. It should be noted that both 

fractions studied before, artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C, are complex mixtures 

composed of several chemical compounds while the ascorbic acid is a pure compound, 

which makes the results obtained in these assays even more remarkable. 

 

4.8. Solar Protection Factor Assay  

Flavonoids are plant pigments that are synthesized from phenylalanine, and several 

studies showed that these compounds have a wide spectrum of pharmacological 

properties, including antioxidative, antiallergic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hepato- 

and gastro-protective, antiviral, and antineoplastic activities, being extremely important 

to human health [23]. Therefore, the content of flavonoids was measure in the artichoke 

extract and the supernatant and the results are showed in Table 4.14.

Sunscreens are usually composed of synthetic chemical filters with a high capacity to 

absorb sun light at the region of UVB (320–290 nm) and UVA (400–320 nm) spectrum. 

Due to all the adverse effects (e.g. estrogenic effects, disruption of human endocrine 

activity, among others) of these compounds, there is a need to reduce the filter 

concentration in sunscreen formulations without affect their properties. A solution to this 

problem is to use natural products with a great antioxidant capacity (e.g. green coffee) 

instead of chemical filters, which may improve the photoprotective activity of sunscreen 

formulations. In fact, these natural products show several advantages, such as the 

bioactivity, relative safety and achievement from renewable sources, low cost, besides 

the feasibility for application in a wide range of health care products. As several studies 

suggest that one of the functions of the flavonoids is to protect the plants from potential 

harmful solar irradiation [24], [25], artichoke extract and the supernatant, rich sources of 

flavonoids and polyphenols, are potential candidates to replace the chemical filters in 

sunscreen formulation [26]. The SPF determination for the artichoke extract and the 

supernatant are represented on Table 4.15. 

Table 4.15 - SPF found for the natural oils/extracts. The data are presented as the mean ± SD of at least 3 replicates 

experiments. 

Sample SPF 

Green coffee oil 5.03 ± 0.23 

Artichoke Extract 10.99 ± 0.29 

Artichoke Fraction C 10.20 ± 0.21 

 

The green coffee oil (GCO) was the chosen positive control, since there are several studies 

suggesting the use of GCO as a potential natural product for improving SPF in sunscreens 

formulations thus, allowing to decrease the concentration of chemical or physical filters 

in such formulations [27]–[29]. This natural oil showed a SPF of 5.03 ± 0.23, while the 

artichoke extract and the supernatant presented 10.99 ± 0.29 and 10.20 ± 0.21, 

respectively. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare both fractions 

with the GCO, and the results showed that there is a significant difference between them 

(p-values &amp;lt;0.05), being the artichoke extract the compound with the highest SPF. 

Therefore, the artichoke extract and the supernatant appears to have an enormous 

potential to be applied in sunscreen formulations with the advantages that they are natural, 

harmless and powerful antioxidants, which prevents the ROS production due to solar 

radiation.

4.9. Topical Formulations Preparation 

4.9.1. Final Formulations 

The artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C were chosen to be incorporated in 

topical formulations, as bioactive ingredients, and it was decided to develop two topical 

formulations for each fraction, a gel and a cream.  

As the purpose of this study is to analyze the properties of the formulations containing 

the bioactive ingredients when applied in human skin, then it was decided to use the less 

ingredients possible to avoid raising doubts about the results obtained for the artichoke 

extract and the artichoke fraction C. 

For both gels (containing the artichoke extract (AG) and the gel containing the artichoke 

fraction C (CG)), it was decided to use a well-known formulation with the only the basic 

ingredients. For the cream containing the artichoke extract (AC) and the cream containing 

the artichoke fraction C (CC), was decided to develop a new formula, and for that were 

chosen specific ingredients in accordance with the final formulation properties desired. 

The formulations details are fully described in Materials and Methods chapter. 

Besides the formulations containing the bioactive ingredients, a blank gel (BG) and a 

blank cream (BC) were also prepared following the formulations chosen for each one. 

These blanks were used as a control for the following studies. 

 

4.9.2. Physico-chemical characterization of formulations  

4.9.2.1. Rheology 

Rheology characterization is very important in cosmetics once it helps reaching the 

optimal formulation that would be appealing to the consumer, choosing the production 

equipment and packaging, studying the formulation stability and it is considered a 

parameter in quality control [30], [31]. Therefore, in order to study the ability of the 

topical formulations to resist structural breakdown when applied to the skin, a shear-rate 

profile was traced for each formulation prepared. The representative flow curves are 

shown in Figure 4.28 and Figure 4.29. Apparent viscosity decreases concurrently with 



71 

 

the increase of shear rate, meaning that all formulations prepared are considered 

shearthinning. 

 

 

In the case of the creams, the flow curves also exhibited hysteresis loops, meaning that 

the formulation suffers a structural breakdown when the stress is applied, and 

consequently the viscosity decreases, but the network is regenerated by energy 

interactions when the stress applied diminishes, and the original viscosity is restored. This 

behavior is typical of time-dependent fluids, since after a sufficient resting time, the 

Figure 4.28 - Flow curves of artichoke extract, artichoke fraction C and blank creams representing shear stress as 

function of shear rate.

original viscosity it recuperated. The viscosity values presented in Table 4.16 show that 

the artichoke fraction C cream is the most and the blank cream is the less viscous 

formulation. The polysaccharides present in the plant extracts are possible responsible for 

the rheology behavior observed, since these swell in contact with water [32]. Therefore, 

the emulsions with artichoke extract or artichoke fraction C incorporated showed high 

viscosity due to the polysaccharides swelled, while the blank showed the lowest viscous 

behavior because it didn’t have these compounds present in it. The results obtained are in 

accord once the artichoke fraction C is the richer fraction in polyphenols, and 

consequently, the most viscous formulation. The opposite was observed for the gel 

formulations, since the artichoke fraction C gel was the formulation that presented the 

lower and the blank the highest viscosity, as represented in Table 4.16. This behavior may 

be due to the different pH observed before the addition of sodium ions and to the sodium 

ions themselves, once pH and ionic strength are both parameters that can influence the 

rheology properties of carbopol gels [33].

4.9.2.2. pH Values 

The pH value of the topical products is a very important parameter, since the pH value 

can influence not only the solubility and stability of the bioactive ingredient in the 

formulations but also its release from the vehicle and its penetration into the skin barrier 

[34], [35]. Therefore, it’s important to evaluate this parameter in each formulation 

produced. If it was out of the ideal pH range, it was corrected adding HCl (decrease pH 

value) or NaOH (increase pH value), depending of the pH value measured. The pH values 

of all formulations prepared are represented in Table 4.17 and all were between 5.4 and 

6.4, meaning that all fit well within the ideal pH range for the skin.

4.9.3. Microbiological Control 

Cosmetics have several ingredients in their constitution that are carbon sources, like 

water, oil and glycerin, and nitrogen sources, like amino acid derivatives and proteins, for 

fungi, bacteria and others microorganisms. Microbiological contamination of cosmetics 

products can lead to their instability, loss of safety and even the loss of their active 

ingredients. Therefore, it’s necessary to use preservatives in cosmetics formulations in 

order to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungi. In the artichoke extract and supernatant 

formulations parabens, in particular methyl paraben and propyl paraben, were used. 

Besides that, the water activity (amount of water available for biological processes) in all 

formulations was reduced by adding glycerin, which has the capacity to bind with water, 

reducing this way the water available in the products, and consequently, naturally 

preserving the formulations from contamination [36]. 

Thus, a microbiological control is a regulatory requirement for cosmetics in order to 

ensure the microbial safety of the it, to maintain the its quality and specifications and to 

guarantee hygienic and high-quality handling [37]. 

Total aerobic microbial count (TAMC) and total combined yeasts and molds count 

(TYMC) tests were performed through the spread-plate method for each formulation, and 

the results showed less than 10 colonies in both tests, which resulted from environmental 

contamination, meaning that the result obtain in all cases was less than 100 CFU per gram 

or milliliter of product tested. This value is lower than the limit imposed by the ISO 

16212:2008 and ISO 21149:2006 defined for these products (Category 2), thus the 

products prepared are considered microbiologically safe.

4.9.4. Formulations Cytotoxicity 

To test the cytotoxicity of all formulations prepared, gels and emulsions, the cell viability 

was evaluated using HaCaT cell lines in a MTT assay. The results obtained for the 

formulations containing artichoke and artichoke fraction C were compared to their blanks, 

as showed in Figure 4.30.  

Figure 4.30 – MTT assay measurement of cytotoxicity of topical formulations containing the artichoke extract (black 

bars) and artichoke fraction C (squares bars) and their blanks (vertical risks bars). The data are presented as the mean 

± SD of 6 replicates experiments. 

 

The creams containing the artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 51% and 

49% of cell viability, respectively. While the gel containing the artichoke extract showed 

51% and the gel with the artichoke fraction C incorporated showed 47%. The cream blank 

showed 94% and the gel blank 90% of cell viability. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 

showed that the emulsions containing the fractions weren’t significantly different 

between them (p-value &gt; 0.05). However, a significant difference (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) was 

noted between the emulsions containing the bioactive ingredients and the blank. The same 

results were obtained for the gels.  

All the formulations containing bioactive ingredients had a poorer cell viability compared 

to its blanks, which aren’t harmful to the cells taking into account each ingredient present. 

The formulations showed a cell viability around 50% when compared to its blanks. 

Therefore, these results show that AC, AG, CC and CG can preliminary be considered as 

safe.

When compared the cell viability of both extracts and their corresponding formulations, 

it is possible to observe a substancial increase of the cell viability from the isolated 

fractions to the formulations, being the results in Figure 4.31. Analysis of variance 

(ANOVA) showed significant differences (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) between the cell viability of 

extracts and their respective formulations. Therefore, the vehicle (emulsion or cream) is 

able to reduce the cytotoxicity of artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C.  

 

4.9.5. Effects on membrane integrity  

In order to evaluate the effects of the formulations containing the bioactive ingredients 

on the membrane integrity of cells, an assay using propidium iodide was realized. This 

compound has the can bind to cellular DNA and as it is impermeant to the plasma 

membrane, it has the ability to only enter and stain damaged cells. The results are showed 

in Figure 4.32.

extract (black bars) and artichoke fraction C (squares bars) and their blanks (vertical risks bars). The data are presented 

as the mean ± SD of 6 replicates experiments. 

 

Both blanks showed a relative propidium iodide (PI) uptake of 1. The gels with the 

artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C incorporated showed a slightly higher 

relative PI uptake of 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. The creams containing the artichoke extract 

and artichoke fraction C showed a relative PI uptake of 1.2 and 1, respectively. Analysis 

of variance (ANOVA) showed that the cream containing the artichoke fraction C and the 

blank weren’t significant different between them (p-value &gt; 0.05). However, a significant 

difference (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) was noted between the emulsion containing the artichoke 

fraction and the emulsion blank. The creams containing the bioactive ingredients were 

also significant different between them. The same analysis showed that the gels 

containing the bioactive ingredients were significant different between them and when 

compared with their blank. 

Considering that the cell lines are a more sensitive system than the actual skin cells and 

that the differences between the AC and CC formulations and their blank isn’t substantial, 

the results showed that all formulations can be considered not harmful.  

 

4.10. Discussion 

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity, solar protection factor (SPF) and 

cytotoxicity were studied for the artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C in order to 

compare both extracts. These in vitro studies showed that both fractions had powerful

ROS scavenging effects either in the presence of H2O2 or UVB radiation, and that both 

had a similar SPF value (10.99 for artichoke extract and 10.20 for artichoke fraction C). 

Cytotoxicity assays revealed also a similar cell viability for both fractions (18.3% for 

artichoke extract and 21.3% for artichoke fraction C). Since the results in all assays were 

identical for artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C, it was decided to incorporate both 

in topical formulations.   

The topical formulations, a gel and a cream, containing the fractions were subjected to 

microbiological control, cytotoxicity and membrane integrity assays in order to evaluate 

their safety for human use. All formulations were considered safe in all assays realized.  

Artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C and their respective formulations exhibited 

similar results in all assays performed. However, the costs and time of production of both 

fractions are very different. Artichoke fraction C required a larger amount of time and 

money to be produced, once it needs to be subjected to several procedures, including the 

precipitation of mucilage, and the washing and lyophilization processes. Therefore, 

taking into account the results and the costs and time of production of each fraction, it 

was decided to use only the formulations containing the artichoke extract in the following 

in vitro and in vivo studies. 

 

4.11. In Vitro Studies: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) 

scavenging activity 

In order to study the ROS scavenging effect of the gel and the cream containing the 

artichoke extract, the ascorbic acid was once again chosen as the antioxidant reference. 

As showed in Figure 4.33, both formulations revealed ROS scavenging activity when 

exposed to H2O2. The artichoke extract gel, artichoke extract cream and the ascorbic acid 

showed a 92.8, 90.3 and 95.7% of ROS reduction, respectively. Analysis of variance 

(ANOVA) was performed and the results showed significant differences (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) 

between both formulations and between each formulation and the ascorbic acid. 

 

 

 



78 

 

 

Another assay using UVB radiation as an inducer of antioxidant stress was performed, 

being the results in Figure 4.34. The artichoke extract gel, artichoke extract cream and 

the ascorbic acid showed an 80.5, 79.6 and 97.5 % of ROS reduction, respectively. 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and the results showed significant 

differences (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) between the both formulations and the ascorbic acid. 

However, no significant differences were observed between the gel and the cream 

containing the artichoke extract. In this assay, the gel containing the artichoke extracts 

revealed the highest antiradicalar activity.

4.12. In Vivo Studies 

4.12.1. Human Repeat Insult Patch Tes ting (HRIPT)  

No evidence for the induction of allergic contact hypersensitivity was observed during 

the HRIPT assay, neither in the induction or in the challenge period. Therefore, the 

formulations showed very good skin compatibility and didn’t exhibited allergenic 

potential, which makes them skin-friendly and dermatologically safe products. 

 

4.12.2. Assessment of the protective effect against oxidative stress 

after UV radiation by chromameter evaluation  

UV radiation is one of the factors that induce photo damage in the skin due to the 

production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also known as free radicals. To prevent the 

reactions of free radicals, the human body has developed defense mechanisms known as 

antioxidants, however they can be inhibited by UV radiation and increase the formation 

of more ROS.  

?-carotene is a Yellow chromophore molecule and when is oxidized by UV radiation it 

loses its chromophore capability and color. This discoloration can be monitored by 

colorimetry (b* parameter). Skin color is obtained using a tristimulus color analyzer that 

measures reflected color. The system uses ?-carotene high sensitivity photocells filtered 

to match CIE standard. The measuring head contains a high-power xenon arc lamp which 

provides diffuse illumination from a controlled angle for vertical viewing and constant 

lighting on the object.  The system detects any slight deviation in the xenon’s light 

spectral distribution. The system provides data for the Luminance (L*), a* (red-green) 

and b*(blue-yellow) color distribution.  

The protective effect against oxidative stress was evaluated by a Minolta Chromameter 

CR-400 (Minolta, Japan) in order to obtain the b* color, which is a measure along the 

yellow-blue axis (positive b* relates to the amount of yellowness and a negative b* to the 

amount of blueness), before and after the application of the products, including the 

formulations containing artichoke extract. ?-carotene was the chromophore chosen as a 

reference in this procedure. The results obtained for the b* color measurement in the first 

day (D0) and the last day (D28) of the study are presented in Table 4.18.

To evaluate the true anti-oxidant activity obtained in each area at the end of the study, a 

relative analysis regarding D0 was performed, being the results summarized in Figure 

4.35. A product shows antioxidant activity when a decrease in the oxidant activity of the 

UVA radiation occurs.  

Regarding the anti-oxidant capacity, the product artichoke extract gel presented an 87.0% 

decrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA radiation. At the same time, the product 

artichoke extract cream presented an 75.8% decrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA 

radiation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant difference (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) 

between artichoke extract gel and the control, and the opposite occurred for the artichoke 

extract cream. Therefore, the artichoke extract gel presented a true in vivo antioxidant 

activity.

4.13. Discussion 

In the ROS scavenging activity assays using H2O2 as inducer of antioxidant stress, the 

artichoke extract showed a ROS reduction of 92.5%, while the gel and the cream 

containing it showed 92.8 and 90.3%, respectively. In the assays using UV radiation, 

artichoke extract, and the gel and cream containing it presented 92.8, 80.5 and 79.6% of 

ROS reduction. Overall, the artichoke extract resulted in a higher percentage of ROS 

reduction. This result is probably due to the availability of the artichoke extract, free form 

or incorporated in a matrix. Aqueous artichoke extract when applied in the cells allows 

the direct contact of artichoke extract in its free form with the cells, resulting in an 

immediate antiradicalar action. On the opposite, the matrices of the formulations, cream 

and gel, are able to retain the artichoke extract, releasing it slowly to the medium with the 

cells, thus the action of it in has less impact due to a more extended response.  

In vivo studies showed that the gel containing the artichoke extract presented an 87.0% 

decrease in the oxidant activity induced by UVA radiation, while the artichoke extract 

cream presented 75.8%. These results are in accordance with the ones obtained from the 

latest in vitro studies, since the gel with the artichoke extract incorporated showed the 

highest antioxidant capacity in both cases. Release profiles of the artichoke extract from 

both formulations can explain the differences of antioxidant activities observed between 

the cream and the gel. In this case, the matrix of the gel may be able to release the 

artichoke extract in a more efficient and faster way than the matrix of the cream. Patel et 

al. [38] studied the percentage of release of psoralen from two distinct formulations, a gel 

and a cream, and the results also showed a higher release profile of psoralen from the gel 

formulations than that from the cream formulations.

5. Chapter: Conclusion 

Cynara Cardunculus var. Scolymus is a rich source of polyphenols, which are responsible 

for its antioxidant properties, and it is highly produced by Mediterranean countries, such 

as France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Currently, plant extracts are being preferable to be 

used in cosmetics products due to the prohibition of the use of animal origin ingredients 

to an increase search for ecofriendly and sustainable products. Therefore, artichoke can 

potential be a specie of interest to be incorporated in cosmetic products with antioxidant 

purposes. 

The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant properties of artichoke extract 

and its use as a bioactive ingredient in topical formulations with antioxidant purposes.  

Infusion revealed to be an efficient procedure to extract bioactive compounds from 

artichoke bracts. Regarding polyphenols, an analysis of artichoke extract revealed the 

presence up to 56 of chlorogenic acid, 7 of cynaroside and 83 of cynarin, which values 

were expressed in µg/mg of artichoke extract. A characterization of artichoke extract 

showed that it is composed by 62.8% of fibers, 3.06 of polyphenols, 0.82% of 

carbohydrates and 0.002% of proteins. DPPH radical scavenging activity assay of 

artichoke extract was realized and it was obtained an EC50 of 99 µg/mL.  

Purification of artichoke extract through an acidic digestion with gastric juice followed 

by a 24 hours’ dialysis, which resulted in artichoke fraction A, proved to be efficient in 

improving polyphenols content, from 31 to 35 µg/mg of artichoke extract. However, the 

amount of extractives, expressed in µg/mg artichoke extract, decreased from 56 to 42 for 

chlorogenic acid, from 83 to 71 for cynarin and for cynaroside the value remained equal. 

Concerning its antioxidant activity, was recorded an improvement from 99 to 95 µg/mL. 

Mucilage precipitation method was tested using two different approaches, one using 

acetic acid and the other only using ethanol, which resulted in artichoke fractions B and 

C, respectively. Regarding polyphenols, artichoke fraction B exhibited 27 ?g/ mg of 

artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C exhibited 23 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract. DPPH 

assay revealed an EC50 of 67 and 56 to artichoke fractions B and C, respectively. A 

chemical analysis of artichoke fraction B revealed the presence of 63, 82 and 14 ?g/ mg 



85 

 

of artichoke extract of chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside, respectively; artichoke 

fraction C revealed the presence of 68, 83 and 18 ?g/ mg of artichoke extract of 

chlorogenic acid, cynarin and cynaroside, respectively.  

An overview of the results obtained from purification methods showed that artichoke 

fraction C was the fraction with better antioxidant activity. However, this was also the 

fraction with lowest phenolic content, despite the increased content of chlorogenic acid, 

cynarin and cynaroside. But since the main goal was to incorporate the fraction with better 

antioxidant properties in topical formulations with antioxidant purposes, the artichoke 

fraction C was the chosen one to proceed with the study.  

Cytotoxicity assays in HaCaT cell lines revealed that both fractions decreased cell 

viability to 18.3% in artichoke extract and 21.3% in artichoke fraction C. ROS scavenging 

activity assay using hydrogen peroxide and UVB radiation revealed powerful antioxidant 

activity for artichoke fraction C and artichoke extract. In the assay using H2O2, ascorbic 

acid reduced 94.9% of ROS, while artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C reduced 

92.5 and 93.1%, respectively. In the UVB radiation assay, significant differences (p-value 

&amp;lt;0.05) between ascorbic acid, artichoke extract and artichoke fraction C weren’t 

observed; artichoke extract and the artichoke fraction C showed 92.8 and 94.2% of ROS 

reduction, while ascorbic acid showed 95.7%. Both fractions also revealed to be rich in 

flavonoids (31 ?g/mg of extract for artichoke extract and 39 ?g/mg of extract for artichoke 

fraction C) and to have solar protection factor, which values were found between 10 and 

11. 

Topical formulations, a cream and a hydrogel, were prepared and both fractions, artichoke 

extract and artichoke fraction C, were incorporated in them. A physical-chemical 

characterization was performed for each formulation and all products showed acid pH 

values and shearthinning behavior, thus they were considered suitable for skin 

application. Assays of cytotoxicity and effects on membrane integrity in keranocytes, and 

a microbiological control showed that all formulations were also suitable for topical 

application. 

Observing the results obtained in the analysis of both fractions and their respective 

formulations, and taking into account the costs and time of production of each fraction, 

formulations containing the artichoke extract, a cream and a hydrogel, were chosen to be 



86 

 

used in more in vitro studies and in vivo studies. In vitro studies included a ROS 

scavenging activity assay using hydrogen peroxide and UVB radiation, and in vivo studies 

included a Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT) and an assessment of the 

protective effect against oxidative stress after UV radiation by chromameter evaluation. 

In the in vitro studies using H2O2 as oxidative stress inducer, the gel and the cream 

containing the artichoke extract showed a ROS reduction of 92.8 and 90.3%, respectively. 

In the assay with UVB radiation, the gel showed 80.5% and the cream showed 79.6% of 

ROS reduction. Overall, the formulations presented a lowest antioxidant activity against 

both inducers when compared with the artichoke extract in its free form (92.5% for H2O2 

assay; 92.8% for the UV radiation assay). 

In vivo studies performed in volunteers demonstrated very good skin compatibility and 

no allergenic potential for both formulations, so they were considered dermatologically 

safe. Regarding antioxidant capacity, artichoke gel and cream exhibited an 87.0% and 

75.8% decrease in the oxidant activity of the UVA radiation, respectively. In this assay, 

the artichoke gel was the topical formulation that presented a true in vivo antioxidant 

activity. 

In both studies, in vitro and in vivo, the gel formulation presented the highest antioxidant 

activity, which can be explain by a higher release profile of the artichoke extract. 

Formulations containing artichoke extract proved to be suitable, safe and efficient for skin 

application and for antioxidant purposes. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis was 

accomplished.
