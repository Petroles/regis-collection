Abstract

This dissertation examines the nature of jet-boundary interactions and the role of baro-

tropic instabilities in the Brazil Current system while still attached to the western

boundary. The motivation was due to the frequent observation of bipolar features

associated to the Brazil Current flow south of Cape Frio (RJ) and off Santos Bight (22?

- 28? S). Such observations were mainly obtained from sea surface temperature im-

ages, and also from few ”in situ” hydrographic and direct velocity measurements data.

Therefore, our main focus is on the formation of bipolar features associated with the

flow, and the main hypothesis is that barotropic instability is responsible for the gen-

eration of such dipoles along the western boundary current jet, while it has to deal

with topographic variations along its path poleward. We address the system dynam-

ics from a semi-theoretical perspective, and also through the application of numerical

modeling on a process study approach. So it includes semi-theoretical studies of jet-

lateral boundary interactions in idealized configurations relevant to the Brazil Current

system off Cape Frio, considering the quasi-geostrophic theory as an appropriate ap-

proximation of the system we want to investigate. Additionally, numerical modeling

is used through the construction of idealized scenarios where we simplify the physics

in order to isolate the dynamical process of interest. All the dynamical analyzes were

initialized from synoptic hydrographic data set which comprised the Brazil Current

system off Cape Frio region. We validated the quasi-geostrophic theory we assumed

and obtained the kinematics characteristics of the jet. In the dynamical analyses, we

started the investigation from the simplest framework applied here, where we evaluate

a piecewise constant potential vorticity field in a quasi-geostrophic contour dynamics

model. It dealt with a meridionally-oriented jet flowing southward along a straight

western boundary. Next, in a second model, we added more complexity in the system,

v



idealizing western boundary coastline scenarios considering a quasi-continuous po-

tential vorticity field in a quasi-geostrophic numerical model. Finally, in a third model,

we constructed a more complex scenario for the Brazil Current jet that incorporated

real topography and stratification of the water column in a primitive equation numer-

ical model.

Among our main finds, we verified that purely barotropic instability is able to gen-

erate vortex dipoles. Moreover, variations in the western boundary can indeed trig-

ger perturbations in the jet and dipoles form. Therefore, sites with abrupt change in

bathymetry and coastline orientation are preferred to the formation of the BC vorti-

cal dipoles. Vortex streets and instability trains can also develop downstream of such

locations as consequence of perturbing a potentially batropically unstable jet. Hence,

the horizontal shear is key to the generation of vortex dipoles. A weak shear does not

allow these features to form, instead, frontal eddies are possibly generated, with the

predominance of anticyclones. Although the three different model strategies applied

here differ in dynamical configurations and approximations, they still kept nearly the

same regime for the Brazil Current vortex-dipole formation. Topographic variations

such as those associated with the change of coastline orientation near Cape Frio (23?S)

account for those vortex dipoles and streets be dominantly observed within the Santos

Bight.

Keywords: Brazil Current, dipoles, quasi-geostrophy, barotropic instability, western

boundary.

Resumo

A presente tese examina a natureza das interac?o?es entre jato e contorno e o papel de

instabilidades barotro?picas no sistema Corrente do Brasil (CB) quando este ainda se

encontra fluindo junto a? margem continental oeste. A motivac?a?o se deu atrave?s da

frequente observac?a?o de feic?o?es bipolares associadas ao escoamento da CB ao sul de

Cabo Frio (RJ) e ao largo da Bacia de Santos (entre 22? e 28? S). Tais observac?o?es se

devem principalmente a imagens termais de temperatura da superf??cie do mar, a al-

gumas raras observac?o?es “in situ” atrave?s de dados hidrogra?ficos e medic?o?es diretas

de velocidade. Assim, o principal foco e? na formac?a?o de feic?o?es bipolares associ-

adas ao fluxo me?dio, sendo a principal hipo?tese a de que instabilidade barotro?pica

e? responsa?vel pela formac?a?o destes dipolos ao longo da corrente quando esta tem que

lidar com variac?o?es da topografia. Este estudo tenta abordar os problemas em uma

perspectiva semi-teo?rica, e tambe?m atrave?s de modelagem nume?rica em uma abor-

dagem de estudos de processo. Assim, inclui estudos semi-teo?ricos em configurac?o?es

idealizadas relevantes para o sistema Corrente do Brasil ao largo de Cabo Frio, con-

siderando a teoria quase-geostro?fica como a aproximac?a?o apropriada para a dina?mica

do sistema que queremos avaliar. Adicionalmente, a modelagem nume?rica e? usada

atrave?s da construc?a?o de cena?rios idealizados onde simplificamos a f??sica a fim de

isolar os processos que queremos investigar. Toda a ana?lise dina?mica partiu de um

conjunto de dados que compreendeu o sistema Corrente do Brasil ao largo de Cabo

Frio. Validamos a teoria quase-geostro?fica que estamos considerando e obtivemos as

caracter??sticas cinema?ticas do jato. Nas ana?lises dina?micas, comec?amos a investigac?a?o

do problema partindo do cena?rio mais simples utilizado aqui, onde consideramos um

campo de vorticidade potencial discretizado em camadas horizontais em um modelo

quase-geostro?fico de dina?mica de contornos. O modelo incorporou a presenc?a de

vii



uma linha de costa retil??nea orientada meridionalmente no contorno oeste. Posteri-

ormente, inclu??mos mais complexidade no sistema, idealizando diferentes cena?rios de

linha de costa e considerando um campo de vorticidade potencial quase-cont??nuo em

um modelo nume?rico quase-geostro?fico. Finalmente, constru??mos um cena?rio ainda

mais complexo para a Corrente do Brasil, o qual incorporou a topografia real da regia?o

e a estratificac?a?o da coluna de a?gua em um modelo nume?rico de equac?o?es primitivas.

Dentre as principais concluso?es, pudemos comprovar que instabilidade barotro?pica

pode promover a formac?a?o de dipolos. Ale?m disso, variac?o?es no contorno podem con-

sequentemente ser gatilhos para gerar perturbac?o?es no jato e dipolos se formam. As-

sim, locais de mudanc?a abrupta de batimetria e orientac?a?o de linha de costa sa?o preferi-

dos para a formac?a?o de dipolos vorticais. Rua de vo?rtices e trens de instabilidade

tambe?m podem se desenvolver a? juzante de tais locais como conseque?ncia de se pertur-

bar um jato potencialmente barotropicamente insta?vel. Consequentemente, um cisal-

hamento horizontal e? chave para a gerac?a?o de dipolos vorticais. Um cisalhamento rela-

tivamente fraco na?o permite a formac?a?o de tais feic?o?es, e em vez disso, vo?rtices frontais

sa?o possivelmente gerados, com a predomina?ncia de anticiclones. Apesar de as tre?s

diferentes estrate?gias aplicadas aqui diferirem em termos de configurac?o?es dina?micas

e aproximac?o?es, estas ainda mantiveram aproximadamente o mesmo regime para a

formac?a?o de dipolos. Variac?o?es na topografia tais como aquelas associadas com mudan-

c?as de orientac?a?o de costa pro?ximo a Cabo Frio (23?S) contam com o fato de dipolos

vorticais e rua de vo?rtices serem frequentemente observados dentro da Bacia de Santos.

Chapter 1

Introduction

This thesis is an effort to extend our understanding of the role of topography and

barotropic instabilities in the dynamics of western boundary current (WBC) jets while

attached to the continental margin. It was motivated by the Brazil Current system

scenario, where the geostrophic current deals with topographic variations and, addi-

tionally, presents an intense mesoscale activity, such as meanders, eddies and bipolar

features. Here, we try to address our theoretical ideas about topography-mean flow-

eddy interactions, idealizing scenarios in accordance to the actual system through the

use of analytical and numerical modeling, and isolating the physical process we are

interested in. The main focus is the investigation of dipoles formation.

1.1 Background and Motivation

1.1.1 The Brazil Current context

WBCs are confined geostrophic jets that flow attached along the western continen-

tal margins of the oceans. Regarding the oceanic large scale wind-driven circulation,

WBCs are seen as the return of the Sverdrup transport integrated for the ocean basin

interior, inside the subtropical gyre regions. The dominance of time-dependent eddies

over the mean flow implies that the characteristics of the current vary strongly in time

[Cessi &amp;amp; Ierley, 1993].

In the South Atlantic, a complex system of WBCs takes place (Figure 1.1). The upper

layer is composed by the Brazil Current (BC) jet that flows poleward along the Brazil-

ian continental margin. Bellow, the Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC)

and the North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC) flow equatorward. Such system is mostly

induced by the large scale wind-driven circulation and it is resultant from the bifur-

cation of the southernmost branch of the South Equatorial Current (sSEC) at several

vertical levels.

Considering the above system at surface, BC originates at the sSEC bifurcation,

between 14.5?S and 16?S, according to the near-surface large-scale climatological flow

patterns [Stramma, 1991; Stramma &amp;amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007]. At this area,

BC is a shallow flow of about 100 m deep, transporting Tropical Water (TW), and it

is characterized by a eddy-dominated flow still organizing itself as a jet, as recently

pointed out by Soutelino et al. [2011].

About 20?S, BC is incremented by the flow coming from the sSEC bifurcation at

intermediate depths, correspondent to the thermocline layer. In this region, the South

Atlantic Central Water (SACW) is carried at a depth range of 150 m to 500 m, which

makes the BC to become deeper. Therefore, downstream of it, within the 20?-26?S lati-

tude range, the BC flow is stronger and better organized along the western boundary.

Nevertheless, BC is associated to an intense mesoscale activity, presenting frequent me-

anders and eddies that may detach from the jet [Signorini, 1978; Garfield, 1990; Silveira

et al., 2000; Calado, 2001; Silveira et al., 2004].

Around 26?-28?S, according to Bo?ebel et al. [1999], the sSEC bifurcates in deeper lev-

els (500 m to 1200 m), which corresponds to the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AIW)

layer [Stramma &amp;amp; England, 1999]. Then, BC flow is even more robust and characterized

by a poleward jet flowing between 0 m and 1200 m. The BC flows until it encounters

the Malvinas Current, around 38?S [Olson et al., 1988]. Such as its analogous Florida

Current in the northern hemisphere, the BC presents a rich mesoscale activity, fre-

quently reported in the literature [Mascarenhas et al., 1971; Signorini, 1978; Silveira et al.,

2000, 2004], characterized by the formation of meanders and eddies along its track.

Regarding the equatorward flow originated from the sSEC bifurcation, the IWBC

is originated within the AIW vertical domain, in 26?-28?S, and flows under the BC

flow. Up north, IWBC flow receives the contribution of sSEC bifurcation within SACW

vertical domain, in 20?S, and becomes NBUC [Stramma &amp;amp; England, 1999]. Up to this

area, NBUC flow has a vertical extension of about 800 m and flows northward right

below BC. North of 15?S, the bifurcation increments NBUC flow with a surface flow,

originating the North Brazil Current [Silveira et al., 1994]. Silveira et al. [2000] presented

a good review of the upper ocean WBC system off the Brazilian coast, characterizing

transports, velocities, water masses composition, vertical extension, occurrence of me-

anders and eddies. Going downward in the water column, below the described system

of WBCs, the wind-driven circulation vanishes and the thermohaline general circula-

tion takes place, composing the deep ocean motion.

Given the large scale wind-driven circulation patterns present at the southwestern

Atlantic, one can see that the vertical structure of the system of WBCs in the upper

ocean is composed basically by 2 layers of opposing flows, which suggests the ex-

istence of a very baroclinic system. Some studies, such as Silveira et al. [2008], pro-

pose that geophysical instabilities due to the vertical shear are responsible for the

growth of some of the recurrent mesoscale features present along the BC flow. Such

intense mesoscale activity is present since its origin until the BC-Malvinas confluence

region. In between this locations (Figure 1.2), the so called southeastern Brazilian coast

presents a more robust BC that very often meanders and form eddies. In general, these



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 4

meanders and eddies present a diameter of about 100 km, having the same scale of the

BC horizontal extension. In this scenario, it becomes important to point out to the to-

pographic characteristics of the region, which is very peculiar and it is probably associ-

ated with the intense mesoscale activity cited above. As we can note in Figure 1.2, Cape

Sa?o Tome? and Cape Frio are locations where the continental margin presents consider-

able variations. In that figure, the 200 m and 1000 m isobaths are indicated with gray

contours, and it is approximately the location of the continental shelf break and slope

regions, respectively. North of Cape Frio, the continental shelf is narrower, the slope

is very steep, and the continental margin presents a north-south orientation. South of

Cape Frio, its direction suddenly changes, firstly becoming dominantly west-east, and

afterward presenting a northeast-southwest direction. In this region, the continental

shelf is wider and the slope smoother. Such characteristics bring several consequences

to the WBC system that takes place in the region. In theory, the geostrophic current

tends to flow along a constant isobath, conserving potential vorticity. Variations in

the topography may cause deviations in the stretching vorticity and, consequently, in

the relative vorticity. Therefore, deviation of the mean steady state flow may occur

as a tentative of the geostrophic jet in conserve potential vorticity. Silveira et al. [2000]

suggested this explanation to the BC meandering off southeast Brazil. Such mesoscale

activity will be better described and discussed in section 1.1.2. Nevertheless it is im-

portant to keep in mind the topographic configuration in this region.

1.1.2 The Brazil Current mesoscale activity and dipoles

Evidence of finite amplitude cyclonic and anticyclonic meanders in the BC system has

been widely reported in the literature, as mentioned by several authors, such as Sig-

norini [1978], Garfield [1990], Silveira et al. [2000], Calado et al. [2006], Silveira et al. [2008],

to cite just a few (and other works cited therein). First observations and descriptions

were reported by the classical studies of Mascarenhas et al. [1971] and Signorini [1978].

Those studies focused on the description of the BC frontal meanders that are frequently

observed off Cape Frio and Cape Sa?o Tome?, southeastern Brazilian coast (22?-23?S, Fig-

ure 1.2). Those meanders very often close in eddies that pinch off from the BC and shed

into the subtropical gyre or are reabsorbed by BC flow [Silveira et al., 2008]. Figure 1.3

illustrates the anticyclonic eddy off Cape Frio described in Signorini [1978] through a

map of dynamical topography derived from hydrographic data. Figure 1.4, presented

by Silveira et al. [2008], shows a sea surface temperature image exemplifying the recur-

rent Cape Sa?o Tome? cyclonic meander pinching off from the BC. The authors, through

current-meter mooring data analyses, applied an instability model which pointed to

baroclinic instability as the mechanism responsible for the meander growth in Cape

Frio-Cape Sa?o Tome? region. Mano et al. [2009] focused on the investigation of energy

transfer between the BC-IWBC system and in the formation of the Cape Frio eddies.

They found out that, due to the vertical shear, baroclinic instability drains energy from

the mean flow of the IWBC at a first moment, and the perturbation signal propagates

upward, ending up in energy drain from the BC. This process allow the cyclonic eddies

to grow through the energy transfer between the mean flow and the perturbations. The

interesting point in this study is the evidence that the energy transfer to the perturba-

tions starts at intermediate depths, which corresponds to the IWBC layer.

Southwestward-propagating, slowly growing meanders were described by Campos

et al. [1995] and Campos et al. [1996] through the observation of a meandering pattern

composed by strong cyclonic and anticyclonic frontal eddies south of Cape Frio. Cam-

pos et al. [2000] suggested that the change in the coastline orientation induces such me-

andering. A close analogy is seen in the western North Atlantic where the Gulf Stream

leaves the edge of the continental shelf near Cape Hatteras and large instabilities be-

gin to develop a short distance downstream [Fofonoff , 1981]. These instabilities form a

sequence of cold core and warm core rings that occasionally detach from the current

main axis. Pratt et al. [1991] used a contour dynamics idealized model and could show

that the Gulf Stream warm rings, known as “warm outbreaks”, are the consequence

of barotropic instabilities in a propagating Rossby wave. Silveira et al. [2000] discussed

that the sequence of opposing signal meanders off Brazil consists of vortex pairs con-

nected to the BC main axis, and have horizontal length scale smaller than the cyclones

off Cape Frio (e.g. smaller than 100 km). Yet, they compare such phenomenon with the

“warm outbreaks” present in the Gulf Stream, and speculated that the phenomenon is

a barotropically unstable topographic Rossby wave. Figure 1.5 illustrates, through a

sea-surface temperature satellite image, a sequence of cyclonic and anticyclonic mean-

ders along the Brazilian continental margin. This sequence of opposing signal mean-

ders suggests the existence of non-paired bipolar features connected to the BC flow. In

Figure 1.6, it is more evident the presence of a non-paired dipole, which was described

by Campos et al. [1996] off southeast Brazil (upper panel). In the lower panel, a paired

bipolar feature is indicated, where two eddies of opposing signs are connected to the

current main axis, and it was presented by Velhote [1998]. The figure also indicates a

frontal cyclonic meander upstream. Despite not discussed by Signorini [1978], in Fig-

ure 1.3 a cyclonic meander is associated with the anticyclonic eddy discussed by the

author, which characterizes a bipolar feature captured by the dataset.

Description of those dipoles along the southeast Brazilian coast and studies fo-

cusing on the dynamics of this phenomenon are very limited, although they are fre-

quent observed through sea-surface temperature satellite images. Here we present

3 snapshots of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) maps that seem to have cap-

tured bipolar features along the southeastern Brazilian continental margin in different

times. The SST data was obtained from the Group for High-Resolution Sea Surface Temper-

ature (SST) (https://www.ghrsst.org/). Over the SST images we plotted the cor-

shot from April 21, 2003. The BC signature can be noticed by the warm waters (reddish

colors), while the continental shelf cold waters are signed by the bluish colors. Figure

1.7 (right panel) shows a snapshot for April 25, 2008. In this one, it is possible to see a

sequence of opposing signs meanders and eddies along the BC axis. The meandering

pattern in centered along the continental shelf break (represented in the figures by the

200 m isobath). Figure 1.8 shows a snapshot for September 5, 2011. In this last one, we

could not obtain the correspondent geostrophic velocity data information. However, it

is still possible to note the signature of a mushroom-like feature.

Additionally to the above evidences, Pereira [2009], in his master thesis, described a

bipolar feature captured by a hydrographic cruise conducted between 22-29 of Septem-

ber, 2003. The cruise was part of the Project “Dina?mica do Ecossistema da Plataforma

da Regia?o Oeste do Atla?ntico Sul”, the DEPROAS Project. It was the last of a se-

ries of five synoptic cruises conducted off southeast Brazil, within the parallels 23?-

26?S and meridians 45?-41?W. The dipole signature was captured both in the refer-

enced geostrophic velocities and in direct-measured velocities. Figure 1.9 illustrates

the directely-observed velocity horizontal field over the streamfunction field obtained

by the author in 20 m depth (upper panel) and 100 m depth (lower panel). In both

maps, the bipolar signature is evident. Trying to go inward the dynamics of the cap-

tured feature, and still using the same cruise dataset, the author applied a barotropic

instability model under the 11/2-layers approximation and could see some incipient

dynamical characteristics. The first one was the evidence of the weakness of the BC

flow after passing by the bipolar structure. A second characteristic pointed by the

author was that relative vorticity and stretching vorticity compete for the system dy-

namics. This indicates that the feature under investigation belongs to typical mesoscale

dynamics. Third, the streamfunction fields associated to the cyclone and to the anticy-

clone act in a way to amplify the potential vorticity structures associated reciprocally

to those fields. This is a general form to define an instability process and, consequently,

he concluded the dipole was under a barotropic growth process. Moreover, the cyclone

induces downstream movement on the anticyclone and vice-versa.

Looking for additional evidences of the presence of the September 2003 dipole, we

called upon again the AVISO data and plotted the geostrophic velocities for the same

period of the DEPROAS V cruise. Figure 1.10 illustrates a snapshot of September 29,

2003, which is within the period the cruise was carried out. It is general consensus

altimeter data is not so reliable in continental shelf and slope regions as it is in the

deep ocean, but the velocity vectors seem to indicate the presence of two eddies of

opposing vorticity right off Cape Frio. The eddies are not so intense or evident as they

were in Figure 1.9, and we can also see the BC flow is continuous south of Cape Frio.

The jet was following the 200 m isobath upstream (around 22?-24?S), and south of this

latitude the current headed straight southwestward, separating from the 200 m isobath

and developing a meandering pattern of opposing signs eddies.

1.1.3 Western Boundary Current dynamical studies

We revise next several idealized dynamical studies about WBC processes that inves-

tigated the role of barotropic instability, topography and coastline orientation on the

formation of vortex-dipoles.

According to Rodr??guez-Marroyo &amp;amp; Viu?dez [2009], oceanic vortex dipoles are basi-

cally two closely packed regions of opposite sign vertical vorticity. Dipoles are stable

coherent vortex structures frequently found in the oceans and atmosphere, especially

at the mesoscale and submesoscale. The processes responsible for the formation of

such structures may vary. If we consider that the BC vortex dipoles are immersed

in a barotropic topographic Rossby wave (such as the Gulf Stream warm outbreaks),

barotropic instability might be the mechanism responsible for the formation of such

features. This was pointed out by the study of Pereira [2009]. The kinematic scenario

favorable to the occurrence of barotropic instability in a jet is basically the existence of

horizontal shear. According to the linear instability theory, the necessary but not suf-

ficient conditions for barotropic instability is the potential vorticity gradient to change

signal at least once in the cross-jet direction. In a f plane approximation, this is known

as the Rayleigh condition. For the ? plane case, it is called Kuo criterion.

Leal Silva [2000] explained the evolution of dipoles in a model of converging WBCs

off a western boundary. The author used a contour dynamics model in a 11/2-layers

configuration and determined that the perturbations prescribed in the central front

create regions of potential vorticity anomaly immersed in regions of larger or smaller

potential vorticity, but of opposing signals. This scenario induced a circular motion

that produced eddies. The phase difference among the vortex structures can stimulate

an amplification of those eddies, which start interacting with each other, and conse-

quently becoming bigger and transforming the initial flow in a sequence of vortex

dipoles, that follow the basic flow.

Bell &amp;amp; Pratt [1992], also applying a contour dynamics model, explored the interac-

tion of an unstable infinite zonal jet and a singular eddy using a jet with piecewise

constant potential vorticity (in a 1-layer and 11/2-layers frameworks). They suggested

that three ingredients are responsible for the stripping of potential vorticity from the

near edges of the jet: (i) the existence of a regular eddy (a regular eddy is referred

as having the velocity field it induces at the jet being opposite to the flow of the jet),

(ii) the near edge of the jet must contain potential vorticity of opposing sign from the

eddy, and (iii) a stagnation point must exist in the flow that remains inside the jet for a

significant percentage of an eddy turnover time. When these three conditions are met,

the eddy strips off an opposite eddy from the near jet edge and the resulting pair move

upstream and away from the jet, forming what they called a “vortex street”. Figure

1.11 shows the mechanism of dipoles formation suggested by the authors.

Schmidt [2004] investigated the interaction of an unstable WBC, eddies and the con-

tinental margin in idealized models of contour dynamics. Using similar scenarios to

the southeast Brazilian coast, he explored the interaction of both a rectilinear and a

curvilinear continental margin and a singular eddy that would represent the BC cy-

clonic and anticyclonic meanders. The author observed the formation of bipolar fea-



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15

tures and suggested that the presence of the continental margin contributed to the

formation of such dipoles. In the study of the interaction of a WBC jet with a recti-

linear meridionally oriented continental margin, a hybrid model of contour dynamics

was implemented. It consisted of allowing a barotropic configuration internally to the

continental margin, and a 11/2-layer on the oceanic side. It was observed that unstable

waves propagated phase and group towards north with the shelf on their left. Addi-

tionally, the narrower the shelf, the smaller are the propagation velocities of the un-

stable waves and their corresponding growth rates. Bands of defined unstable waves,

with short and long wave limits, were obtained for all the analyzed flow configuration.

The contour dynamics experiments showed that regardless of the disturbance being

cyclonic or anticyclonic, the topographic eddies formed were always anticyclonic. His

investigation in the curvilinear coastline was limited to the barotropic 1-layer approx-

imation only, where he looked to the interaction between cyclonic and anticyclonic

eddies with the continental margin. The bulk dynamical characteristics of the model

runs, such as the formation of dipoles and topographic eddies, were not changed in

this new configuration relatively to a meridionally oriented coast.

Stern &amp;amp; Whitehead [1990] looked to the problem of separation of a jet from a curvy

coast. A semi-infinite jet was considered along a vertical wall in a rotating fluid, with

the nose of the intrusion approaching a corner where the wall turns through an obtuse

angle ?+180?. The jet separates at the corner and flows into the interior if ? exceeds a

critical ?c, otherwise part of the jet continues around the corner and flows along the

downstream segment of the wall. The separation criterion was computed using an in-

viscid and piecewise-uniform-vorticity model. The separation effect was also demon-

strated by a laboratory experiment in which a two-dimensional jet flows along the wall

from a source. Their calculations suggested that the separation mechanism is indepen-

dent of local viscous forces, although the cumulative effect of lateral eddy stresses in

the jet is important in establishing the value of ?c immediately upstream from the cor-

ner. The resulting scenario for the separating jet was the formation of a dipolar vortex

which propagated into the interior, and thereby established the path for the trailing jet.

In the non-separating jet case, the flow continued along the downstream segment of

the wall and formed a strong wall current at and downstream from the corner. This



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 16

was accompanied by a large counterclockwise offshore eddy, and no evidences of bipo-

lar features were seen. In this case, all the initial conditions were the same as in the first

one, except that ?c was reduced by half. Hence, they argue that this separation effect is

not merely a simple consequence of the forward momentum of the jet, and actually it

is strongly dependent on the angle of the change in the coastline.

1.1.4 Scientific questions

In the above paragraphs we tried to summarize all the knowledge related to the BC dy-

namics south of Cape Frio and point out the missing issues. We were mostly motivated

by the occurrence of bipolar features, that lack investigations regarding their dynamics

in term of formation, growth and interaction with the continental margin. The recent

observational study of Pereira [2009] showed an unique observational evidence of a BC

dipole captured by direct-velocity measurements and hydrographic datasets. In this

context, some scientific questions can be pointed out:

• What is the role of lateral boundary variations in the formation and growth of

bipolar features frequent observed off southeast Brazil?

• Is barotropic instability the mechanism responsible for the formation of these

bipolar features?

The questions formulated above motivated us to develop the present research, and

the goals will be presented in the next section. Besides the gap of knowledge regard-

ing dipoles formation off southeast Brazilian coast, it is important to highlight some

other interesting and important aspects of this location. We have mentioned the com-

plexity of the topography, which presents contrasting characteristics between the north

and the south of Cape Frio. Associated with that, a relatively intense coastal upwelling

system takes place off Cape Frio and Cape Sa?o Tome?, being the most important present

along the Brazilian coast. Coastal upwelling is not common at the eastern coasts of the

continents, as it is at the western coasts, and it is another interesting oceanographic

characteristic of southeastern Brazil region. Although it is not the focus of our study,

the interaction of such phenomenon with BC and its eddies has been investigated. This



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 17

set of attributes (WBCs system + topography + coastal upwelling) makes the southeast-

ern Brazilian continental margin an interesting area for oceanographic investigations,

and exert some influence in the economic aspects of the region, since it is one of the

main locations of offshore oil prospection and fishery economy in Brazil. For instance,

offshore platform installation and operation depends on the knowledge regarding the

oceanic circulation, and fishery activity might be dependent on the biomass production

related to the rich-nutrient upwelled waters.

1.2 Thesis Objectives

The rich mesoscale activity and the complex topographic characteristic off southeast

Brazil motivated us to investigate the dynamics of BC dipoles and the role of topogra-

phy on it. Given the lack of studies that have investigated the physical processes that

drive the formation and growth of such dipoles, and considering the questions formu-

lated in the previous section, we proposed a semi-theoretical and idealized investiga-

tion of the interaction of the BC flow and topography, looking to the development of

geostrophic instabilities able to form dipoles and likely features. The work discussed

here attempts to improve our theoretical understanding of the role of topography (fo-

cusing on lateral boundary variations primarily) in the time-dependent dynamics of a

meridionally evolving, strongly inertial, unstable jet in a configuration and parameter

regime that is relevant to the BC jet system, as well as other relatively weak WBCs

(while attached to the continental margin).

Therefore, the objectives are:

1. to characterize an approximately non-perturbed BC jet captured by an hydro-

graphic dataset that comprised Cape Frio oceanic region. Here we aim to describe

the flow in terms of horizontal and vertical extensions, cinematic characteristics

and horizontal cross-jet structure of velocity and potential vorticity;

2. to obtain the linear instability properties of the BC jet, such as phase and group

velocities and growth rate of the perturbations;

3. to isolate the barotropic instability effect and examine the nonlinear evolution of



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 18

a unstable meridional jet attached to a rectilinear western boundary;

4. to examine the interaction of a barotropically unstable meridional jet and a west-

ern boundary in idealized configurations relevant to BC jet system, in particular

the role of lateral boundary variations;

5. to examine eddy-jet-topography interactions of a meridional evolving jet inside

a realistic topography scenario.

The present study is based on quasigeostrophic theory, and all the dynamical pa-

rameters computed and discussed here are done assuming this physical simplification,

which is reasonable to the phenomenon scale in question. Nevertheless, through ob-

servational data analyses, we will be able to validate such approximation.

In order to accomplish those goals, we consider the geophysical instability theory

to obtain the linear instability properties of the BC jet. This is also the reason why we

aim to describe firstly an approximately non-perturbed BC jet. Goals 3, 4 and 5 are

all nonlinear analyzes. Following the presented order, in each one, we aim to make

use of more complex frameworks and methodologies and, therefore, try to construct

a theoretical understanding of dipole formation through the isolation of physical pro-

cesses. Then, item 3 makes use of the contour dynamics technique where a piecewise

constant potential vorticity field is constructed based on the BC jet characteristics and

evolves nonlinearly in time. Item 4 makes use of a quasigeostrophic numerical model

where the potential vorticity field is quasi-continuous and the effect of a curvy west-

ern boundary is inserted. Finally, for goal 5 we make use of a primitive equations

numerical model framework where we also include an idealized BC jet, but using a

realistic topography scenario. The methodologies briefly described above will be fully

presented on their correspondent chapters.

It is the hope that the semi-theoretical approach of studying idealized models will

permit more insight on the essential physics of the system, while the observational

analysis can provide the necessary reality check to help understand the relevance of

the idealized system and the theoretical framework derived from it to the real oceanic

system. Taken together, the goal is to construct a tractable theoretical framework in

which to think about eddy-jet-western boundary interactions in WBC jet systems, that



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 19

gives both an understanding of the dynamics from first principles, as well as an under-

standing of its relevance to the actual oceanic system.

1.3 Thesis Outline

Work towards achieving these goals is presented in the following five chapters. Chap-

ter 2 presents a brief overview regarding the theory in which we based our study.

Moreover, we present the BC potential vorticity structure from observational data. Yet,

we validate the theory we are applying in this study using the cited dataset. Based on

the observational evidences of the BC, in Chapter 3 we apply the technique known as

contour dynamics. Therefore, we perform a linear evaluation of the observed jet and

analyze the evolution of a idealized meridional jet in a piecewise potential vorticity

field. Advancing our analyses into the nonlinear theory, Chapter 4 presents the non-

linear, time-dependent development of a meridional unstable jet attached to a western

boundary in a quasigeostrophic numerical model, where the potential vorticity field

is now continuous. Finally, Chapter 5 consists in the evaluation of a BC-like jet in a

primitive equation numerical model. The modeled scenario consists of a continuously

stratified ocean with nearly-real topography. A general discussion and conclusions are

presented in Chapter 6.

Quasigeostrophic approximation of

2.1 Theoretical background

As mentioned in Chapter 1, WBCs are defined as confined geostrophic jets, part of the

large scale wind-driven circulation at subtropical latitudes, and correspond to the re-

turn of Sverdrup transport integrated for the ocean basin. However, WBCs can not be

essentially described using the geostrophic approximation, since it is very idealized.

Oceanic jets such as WBCs usually are characterized as robust flows that may develop

deviations or perturbations along its track, which are translated in the formation of me-

anders or vortices (theses last ones may develop when the perturbation grow). Those

jets present low Rossby number, which means Earth rotation is highly important for

their dynamics. Oceanic motions under this characteristic can be studied and better

described by quasigeostrophic (QG) theory, which in summary means to allow devia-

tions of the steady geostrophic motion. Consequently, it is possible to investigate the

formation of meanders, eddies and geophysical instabilities along the jet.

Therefore, our study is based on QG theory, given the suitability of investigating

WBCs dynamics by such approximation, and we will follow Pedlosky [1987]. It is im-

portant to point out that we are trying to investigate the development of geophysical

instabilities in a geostrophic flow, and the first consideration the QG theory assumes

is that perturbations start growing from a initial basic state, e.g. a mean steady state

20



CHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 21

flow. The linear theory explains the development of these perturbations while their ve-

locities are considered much smaller than the mean flow velocities. At the point these

perturbations become too strong (e.g. the perturbed velocities have same order that

the basic velocities), the nonlinear theory comes to solve the missing issues. Therefore,

the geostrophic system of equations (which describes a horizontal steady state motion)

are complemented by the temporal and advective derivatives, and from the combina-

tion of the equations of motion considering those terms, we obtain the time-dependent

potential vorticity equation:

q = 0, (2.1)

where u and v represent, respectively, the zonal and meridional geostrophic velocities.

This equation defines the main statement of the QG theory, which is conservation

of potential vorticity (PV) q. For the 1-layer barotropic ocean under the short-wave

approximation, q is define as

q = ?2? + ?y, (2.2)

and for a 11/2-layer (or equivalent-barotropic) ocean,

q = ?2? ?

, whereas

?? represents the density difference between the layers, H is the mean active layer

thickness and g is the gravity acceleration. In the equivalent-barotropic approximation,

it represents the first baroclinic deformation radius.

Here one can see the major advantage in using the QG framework. All the dynam-

ics is reduced to a single equation that is a function of ?, which is a scalar variable

and makes the problem easier to be solved. It’s important to highlight here that all this

system of equations describes a horizontal motion. Equation 2.4 presents the relation

between the geostrophic velocities and ?:

In the next section, we will present a recent hydrographic dataset which comprised

the BC system off southeast Brazil. We used this data to characterize the system under

investigation in terms of vertical and horizontal structure, focusing the data analysis

in guiding us to the development of the dynamical analyzes we proposed.

2.2 Brazil Current potential vorticity structure and quasi-

geostrophic validation

The beginning of our analyzes will start from the evaluation of a hydrographic dataset

which comprised the BC vertical and horizontal structure off Cape Frio. This dataset

was obtained from a hydrografic cruise conducted in July, 2001 and was the second

of the Project ”Dina?mica do Ecossistema da Plataforma da Regia?o Oeste do Atla?ntico

Sul” (DEPROAS II). The cruise consisted of a transect off Cape Frio, composed by

26 hydrografic station, but only 6 comprised the BC flow, e.g. the continental shelf

break and slope regions. The data acquisition was performed through the use of CTD

top-bottom profiling. The CTD equipment (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth Profiler)

measures temperature and salinity (T-S) along the water column. The cruise stations

are illustrated in Figure 2.1.

We opted for choosing this dataset due to the presence of a BC flow apparently free

of perturbation, e.g. no eddies or frontal meanders were associated with its flow. So,

we are considering here that this current represents the quasi-mean state of the BC off

Cape Frio. This is important to our evaluation since we will prove that a quasi-mean

flow is barotropically potentially unstable, so we will be able to validate the use of this

data.

The dataset provided us density field information to allow us to compute baroclinic

geostrophic velocities. Instead of following the traditional way of obtaining it through

the Dynamic Method, we applied the POMsec (Princeton University Oceanic Model in

its sectional version) to obtain vertical sections of absolute baroclinic geostrophic ve-

locities. The method, according to Lima [1997] and Silveira et al. [2004], is independent

of a reference level (for that reason it is called ”absolute”), and we followed the above

authors for our calculation. The use of baroclinic geostrophic velocities for our study

is adequate, since the BC is a very baroclinic current, as discussed in Chapter 1.

Regarding the goals of our study, here we are interested in the kinematics structure

of the BC system. Some properties, related to the cross jet and vertical velocity struc-

tures, are important information to help us in both determining the linear instability

properties of the jet, and in prescribing the initial idealized conditions for the nonlinear

evaluations. Moreover, we may determine if the jet is potentially unstable to develop

geophysical instabilities, insofar as such conditions may trigger the development of

mesoscale features. Therefore, we will use the baroclinic geostrophic velocity output

described above to develop all the following analyzes.

Firstly, we shall present the vertical section of meridional velocity obtained across

Cape Frio, illustrated in Figure 2.2. In the figure, the reddish colors and negative values

represent the BC flow, while the bluish colors and positive values are representative of

the IWBC. From this figure, one can see the BC occupying the first 450 m of water

column, flowing southwestward right above the continental slope. Underneath it, the

IWBC is flowing northeastward, between 500 m and 1400 m.

Figure 2.2: Vertical section of baroclinic geostrophic velocity along the transect across Cape
Frio. Hydrografic data obtained from DEPROAS II cruise.

In having the velocity field, we shall validate the application of QG theory for the

observed system we are analyzing. Therefore, we followed Pedlosky [1987] and checked

the conditions for the QG approximation. The first condition is the Rossby number

to be very small, e.g. Ro = |?||f0| ? 1. Here ? is the vertical component of relative

vorticity vector defined as ? =
(
?v
?x
? ?u

?y

)
, and only the first right-hand side term is

valid for the present case. Our calculation gave us a mean Ro = 0.18, which cannot

be considered very small (e.g., smaller than 0.1), but leads to the information that the

relative vorticity represents only 20% of the absolute vorticity. This value is comparable

to other estimates that employed QG theory for the study of other WBCs, such as



CHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 25

the Florida Current and the North Brazil Undercurrent [Xue &amp;amp; Mellor, 1993; Meacham,

1991; Silveira et al., 1999]. The second one would be the ? plane approximation, e.g.

?? = ?L|f0| ? 1. L should be the typical length scale of the BC width and its eddies, that

we considered as having order 100 km. This gave us ?? = 0.04, which satisfies not only

the ? plane approximation, but we can securely ensure the f plane approximation is

also valid.

After assuring the QG approximation can be applied to our study, we shall compute

the QGPV (q) profile. To do so, we shall introduce the dynamics we are going to retain

in our idealized QG ocean, where we will be basing all the following analyzes. Con-

sidering that the BC system presents an undercurrent below the BC flow and since we

want to test the possibility of barotropic instability in triggering the formation of vor-

tices and dipoles, we opted for considering a 11/2-layer model (also known as reduced-

gravity approximation). This approximation allows us to incorporate both the condi-

tion for barotropic instability and the stratification effect in its minimal form. In other

words, we keep the baroclinic scales of geostrophic adjustment but isolate the BC from

interacting with the IWBC, and therefore, not allowing baroclinic instability to occur.

Figure 2.3 exhibits our reduced-gravity model configuration. In the model, the rigid lid

approximation is valid and the dynamically active layer corresponds to the BC layer

(?1). In Figure 2.3, such layer is represented with thickness H. Yet, h = H +?, where ? is

the vertical variation of the interface between ?1 and ?2. Within each layer, the Taylor-

Proudman theorem is valid, e.g., the layers are homogeneous. The lower layer (?2) is

considered infinite and at rest. Hence, the QG velocities are null (u = v = 0), while

the dynamically active layer of potential density (?1) is in motion. Thus, Equation 2.3

under the f plane approximation becomes

q = ?2? ?
?

R2d
. (2.7)

Since we are dealing with a vertical section, instead of following the traditional

method of computing q through the streamfunction ?, we opted for an alternative way

and considered the Ertel PV equation for our calculations. For the 11/2-layer ocean, the

Ertel PV equation is represented by Equation 2.8:

D?

Dt
= 0 (2.8)

and

? =
? + f

h
, (2.9)

where ? is the relative vorticity and h is the dynamical active layer thickness (see Figure

2.3. After estimating ? and h, we shall use Equation 2.8 to obtain Ertel PV. From that,

we may subtract the basic PV, assumed not to be dynamically relevant, e.g. we are

interested in the ? perturbation. Therefore, q can be written as

q = H ? ?f0, (2.10)

where H is the mean upper layer thickness in the QG model (same as H of Figure 2.3),

indeed, a proxy for the QGPV q.

The first step to obtain q is determining the mean cross-jet velocity profile inside

the active layer. Such layer was considered as the one defined by the SACW thickness,

which comprises the pycnocline layer. Therefore, it is located below the mixed layer

where ageostrophic processes may be relevant. The SACW layer is usually defined as

the one in between the 25.6 and 26.9 kg m?3 isopycnals [Me?mery et al., 2000; Silveira,

2007]. We computed the mean vertical velocity considering the 26.9 kg m?3 isopycnal

mean level, which was about 500 m of depth. Figure 2.5 illustrates the SACW vertical

layer we are considering here. Figure 2.4 illustrates the BC velocity vertical section

where we plotted the SACW upper and lower limits.

The velocity profile is illustrated in Figure 2.6 and gave us a jet width of 80 km and

a maximum along-stream velocity of -0.33 m s?1. Then, considering the velocity profile

obtained in Figure 2.6, we calculated ?, that is represented by Figure 2.7 (left panel).

Figure 2.7 (right panel) illustrates the cross-jet q profile. At a first glance, one can see

that such profile changes sign along the cross-jet direction. Considering x direction per-

pendicular to the jet axis and y direction parallel to the jet axis, we checked the Rayleigh

condition in this profile. Rayleigh condition says ?q/?x profile must have at least one

inversion of sign inside the jet domain, and this defines the necessary but not suffi-

cient conditions for barotropic instability. An additional and more robust condition

for barotropic instabilities is known as Fjørtoft condition, that requires the (v??vc)?q/?x



CHAPTER 2. QUASIGEOSTROPHIC APPROXIMATION OF BRAZIL CURRENT 28

profile to be positive in one portion of the domain (v? is the mean along-stream velocity

component and vc is the velocity value correspondent to the inflexion point of ?q/?x).

Figure 2.8 illustrates both the Rayleigh and Fjørtoft conditions computed for the q pro-

file in Figure 2.7. Looking to them, one can see that both conditions are met. Therefore,

we can conclude that the observed BC is potentially barotropically unstable, e.g. it is

characterized as a jet able to develop barotropic instabilities. From that, we may go for-

ward in our analyzes, having velocity and PV structure as import parameters. It is also

relevant to point out that goal number 1 (presented in Section 1.2) was accomplished,

e.g. we characterized an approximately non-perturbed BC jet captured by an hydro-

graphic dataset off Cape Frio in terms of horizontal and vertical extensions, cinematic

characteristics and horizontal cross-jet structure of velocity and potential vorticity.

Chapter 3

The contour dynamics model

The present chapter aims to describe the first step into the investigation of the dynam-

ics of the BC and the formation of bipolar features. Using a dynamical approximation

in accordance with the observed jet scenario off southeast Brazilian coast, we started

from the application of the method known as contour dynamics (CD), where a piece-

wise constant PV field is evolved in a model that considers a meridional southward jet

flowing along a straight western boundary wall. The idea of the present chapter is to

start from the simplest analysis, where we retain the physics we are interested in and

where we have the control of the processes that are governing the results. Advancing

to the next chapters, we go towards the application of methodologies that bring more

dynamical complexity to the study. Therefore, at each degree of complexity we ad-

vance into, the previous analysis certainly works as a control scenario and a baseline

for the next one.

3.1 Methodology

The classical application of QG models is the use of the method known as CD, vastly

used in studies that tried to investigate the dynamics of geophysical flows, including

WBCs. Since geophysical flows are associated with PV fronts, the use of step function

is a reasonable approximation. The technique was developed by Stern [1985] and Pratt

&amp;amp; Stern [1986], and some important applications are in Polvani et al. [1988], Polvani

et al. [1989], Meacham [1991], Pratt et al. [1991], and others. This method consists in

31



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 32

assuming that the PV horizontal field is discretized in layers of uniform vorticity. The

front separating each layer is called a contour, and PV is conserved along each contour.

Moreover, the velocity is continuous across each front, but the PV is discontinuous.

Then the CD technique consists in simply following the evolution of these contours.

Since PV is conserved, these contours are material curves.

The geostrophic velocities can be written as contour integrals which are dependent

upon the position of the contours, through the inversion of q [Pullin, 1992]. It is possible

to see how the advection changes the modeled ocean structures through the evolution

of q anomalies and the currents induced by them. The advantage in using CD is char-

acterized by the principle of inversion of q, and then the problem (originally in two or

three dimensions) is reduced to a set of linked unidimensional problems.

Silveira et al. [1999] utilized a configuration of q with only one PV front (one con-

tour) in a equivalent-barotropic ocean in order to study converging jets along a west-

ern boundary. Silveira &amp;amp; Flierl [2002] investigated the same problem in a 21/2-layers

configuration, and considering a three-front jet. Following both studies, here we im-

plemented the technique for a 3-front meridional jet flowing along a western bound-

ary in a 11/2-layers ocean. The initial conditions of the CD model were constructed

based on the jet structure and kinematics characteristics obtained in Chapter 2. The

CD technique is composed by two parts. The first consists of a linear analysis, where

the linear theory considers the magnitude of the flow perturbations much smaller than

the magnitude of the mean flow velocities. This allow us to obtain the linear instabil-

ity properties of the jet. The nonlinear analysis allow these perturbations to grow and

give us the time evolution of the piecewise constant PV field. In the next section, we

present the development of the CD methodology for the case of a n-fronts meridional

jet flowing along a meridionally-oriented western boundary.

3.1.1 The linear model

Here we will present the equations considering a meridional jet attached to the western

boundary. Since the BC flows in the southwest direction, we will consider y as the di-

rection parallel to the jet and x as the direction normal to the jet. Within the jet domain,

we assumed conservation of q, in accordance with 11/2-layers QG theory. Therefore,



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 33

we shall recall Equation 2.6 and the q inversion relationship given by Equation 2.3.

The CD technique, besides using the q inversibility relation, requires the utilization of

the equations in their non-dimensional form. Therefore, we may scale some impor-

tant parameters that will be used in the linear model. The scales utilized in this study

are presented in Table 3.1. Therefore, Equation 2.3 in its non-dimensional form and

assuming f plane is

(?2 ? 1)? = q. (3.1)

It is important to point out that, since we are dealing typically with mesoscale struc-

tures, we utilized Rd as the characteristic horizontal length scale. As we presented in

Section 2.2, it was previously computed as having 36 km.

Table 3.1: Non-dimensional scales.

QUANTITY SCALE

potential vorticity V R?1d
horizontal PV gradient V R?2d
V = jet core velocity

The linear model here consists in a set of calculations we utilized to determine the

gradient of PV and the zonal profile of the meridional velocity, which are function of

the choices of mean velocity values at the contours. Here we also developed the set of

equations that have considered the western boundary close to the flowing jet, which

means the continent has influence on the dynamics of the fronts (contours). Following

Silveira et al. [1999], the q fields can be expressed as

q(x) = q0 +
3?
i=1

?iH[x? x?i ? ?i(y,t)] . (3.2)

In Equation 3.2, the contours are enumerated in sequence with index in the range

1 to 3. The ?i values correspond to the q jumps (e.g. the gradients), x?i are the con-

tours mean positions, and ?i their deviations. H represents the Heaviside step function,

where



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 34

H(x) = 0 for x &amp;lt;0

H(x) = 1 for x &gt; 0 .

It is possible to replace the choices of ?i by choices of v?i, e.g., the basic meridional

velocity values at the contours. Then, through the initial choice of x?i and v?i, the linear

instability properties can be obtained. The reader should note that we opted to use

a PV structure of four regions of piecewise constant q separated by three fronts. This

choice was made in order to correctly approximate the PV structure on the cyclonic

and anticyclonic borders of the WBC jet. Moreover, the application of the technique is

reasonable and it is relatively easier to solve the integrations for a three-fronts jet. As

you increase the number of fronts, the problem becomes much more complex because

you introduce a higher number of degrees of freedom.

The inversion relationship that solves the problem is Equation 3.1. Splitting such

solution in two parts, we can have one part related to the basic state ?? (the undis-

turbed and straight front), and the other related to the perturbed state ?? (this last one

is associated to small amplitude waves). Therefore, we obtain

? = ??(x,y) + ??(x,y,t). (3.3)

Considering a wave solution type for ??, we can write

?? = ?(x)eil(y?ct), (3.4)

where c is the phase velocity and l is the wavenumber parallel to the jet. Therefore, the

solutions for ? and u? are also a wave solution type

?i = ??ie
il(y?ct) (3.5)

and

u? = u?eil(y?ct). (3.6)

Similarly to Equation 3.3, we shall split q as

q = q?(x) + q?(x,y,t). (3.7)



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 35

where

q? = q0 +

?iH(x? x?i) (3.8)

and

q? =

?i [H(x? x?i ? ?i(y,t)) ?H(x? x?i)] . (3.9)

Given the solutions above, we can write the inversion relationship for both solu-

tions q? and q?, where (
?2

?x2

)
?? = q? (3.10)

and

(?2 ? 1)?? = q?. (3.11)

Applying the equation that relates ?, u and v (Equation 2.4) in Equations 3.10 and

3.11, linearizing and assuming small amplitude waves, we obtained for the basic state

(

tion type Equation 3.6, we obtain

u? =

Replacing ?i and u? in Equations 3.13 and 3.14 for the wave solutions and linearizing

(3.15)

and

CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 36

The solutions for 3.12 and 3.15 are obtained from the Green’s function method, that

satisfies

?2

?x2
+ (l2 + 1) G(x|x?) = ?(x?x?). (3.17)

The solution for Equation 3.17 in the presence of a western boundary placed at x =

0 is

Gl(x|x?) = Gl+(x|x?) + Gl?(x|x?), (3.18)

where

Gl+ =

and

The Gl? is associated with the vortex images necessary to satisfy the boundary condi-

and

u? = ?il

Having Equations 3.16, 3.22 and 3.23, we can find the dispersion relation through

the applications of 3.16 in each contour and

Ml ??i = 0. (3.24)



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 37

Ml is the squared matrix 3 × 3 given by the three equations mentioned above. The

non-trivial solution for c is found considering

det(Ml) = 0. (3.25)

From the dispersion relation equation, we obtain a complex number c, in which the

real and imaginary parts are related, respectively, with the phase velocity (c) and with

the wave growth rate (?). The non-trivial solutions for c is obtained as

c = cr + ici = cr +
i?

l
. (3.26)

We can also obtain the wave frequency (?) and its group velocity (cg), expressed by

? = lc (3.27)

and

cg =
d?

dl
. (3.28)

Having Equation 3.22, we can obtain the zonal profile of the meridional jet . In

practical terms, such equation is solved in a inverted form, since the choice of v?(x?i) is

more intuitive than the q jumps choice in each front (?i).

The set of equations presented above characterizes the linear analysis, and we have

shown how to obtain the linear instability properties, which are the zonal profile of the

meridional jet, growth rate of the unstable waves and phase and group velocities.

3.1.2 The nonlinear model

The nonlinear model is the second part of the CD technique. It determines the non-

linear evolution of the system from a initial PV distribution. The conservation of q

equation is Equation 3.1. Then, we again split the q and ? fields in two parts, such as

Equation 3.3:

? = ??(x,y) + ??(x,y,t). (3.29)



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 38

where ?? is associated to the rectilinear q fronts positions. The inversibility relation that

associates q? and ?? is according to Equations 3.8 and 3.10:

(?2 ? 1)?? = q? (3.30)

= q0 +
3?
i=1

?iH(x? x?i). (3.31)

The ?? component is the perturbed part of the solution, and it is correspondent to

the streamfunction field associated to space-temporal deviations of ?. Therefore, as

defined in Equation 3.9 and 3.11,

(?2 ? 1)?? = q?

=
3?
i=1

?i [H(x? x?i ? ?i) ? H(x? x?i)] . (3.32)

According to Pratt &amp;amp; Stern [1986], in order to set appropriate boundary conditions,

the Green’s function takes the form

G = G+ + G? = ?
1

2?
K0(r+) +

2?
K0(r?) , (3.33)

where K0 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order zero, G? repre-

sents the image point required to satisfy ?? = 0 at the western boundary and

r+
2 = (x?x?)2 + (y ?y?)2 ,

r?
2 = (x + x?)2 + (y ?y?)2 .

The disturbed velocity field is determined from Equation 3.32, according to stream

function definition

(u?,v?) = (?
?

?y
,
?

?x
)?? , (3.34)

and using Equation 3.33.

The contour dynamics technique requires Equation 3.34 be written in terms of con-

tour integrals. According to Pratt &amp;amp; Stern [1986], we need to express the x and y deriva-

tives in terms of x? and y?. We then follow Silveira &amp;amp; Flierl [2002] derivation in using the

where ?D is the contour enclosing D, ~n? is the unit vector normal to ?D, dl? is the

infinitesimal increment along ?D, and~i? is the unit vector in the x?-direction.

An analogous procedure can be applied to obtain the disturbed cross-shore velocity

u? in terms of contour integrals. Using the Green’s function definitions (3.33) in the

velocity expressions yields

u? =

The partitioning of the streamfunction field was chosen so that Equations 3.32, 3.39

and 3.40 do not involve improper integrals, which potentially behave poorly [Pratt &amp;amp;

Stern, 1986]. Rather, ?D in Equations 3.39 and 3.40 has finite boundaries.

However, Equations 3.39 and 3.40 still have a logarithmic singularity because K0(r) '

? ln(r) when r is very small. The singularity is circumvented following Polvani et al.

[1988] through a simple integration by parts of Equations 3.39 and 3.40, leading to the

It is important to notice that the above equations are nonlinear. However, since

the second term in the Taylor series expansion of H is the delta function, the above

system can be easily linearized. It is important to highlight that the separation of ? in

components, according to Silveira et al. [1999], is done to facilitate the application of the

CD technique in semi-infinite domains.

3.2 Linear analysis results

Recalling the cross-jet velocity profile of Figure 2.6, we computed a BC width of ap-

proximately 80 km. In that figure, one can notice the BC jet is almost symmetric, with

its core located at about 50 km from the shelf break. The coastal side of the jet is at

about 90 km distance from the nearest point in the coast and the offshore side at about

160 km. Getting the maximum velocity value in this profile and considering Rd as the

horizontal length scale, we scaled the parameters of the model according to Table 3.1,

using Rd = 36 km and |vmax| = V = 0.33 m s?1. Figure 3.1 presents again the original

velocity profile with the indication of the three contours positions used for the linear

model. Still in the figure, the non-dimensional velocity profile is illustrated, also with

the indication of the three contours positions. The non-dimensional values used as in-

put parameters for the linear model are presented in Table 3.2, where i refers to each

front (i = 1 is the continental-side front, i = 2 is the jet core front, and i = 3, the deep

ocean side front). x?i are the front positions, vi are the velocities at each front, and ?i

are the PV jumps.

Having that, we applied the linear model. The modeled jet profile is illustrated

in Figure 3.2 (left panel), where we also plotted the original observed one for com-

parison. The model also gave us the q jumps (?i), also presented in Table 3.2. It is

important to highlight the change of sign in the ?i values, which satisfy the Rayleigh

necessary conditions for barotropic instability. Figure 3.2 (right panel) illustrates the

non-dimensional q profiles, the modeled over the observed one (presented in Chapter

2).

The linear instability properties of the modeled jet are represented by Figure 3.3.

The upper panel illustrates the phase and group velocities of the unstable wave, while

the lower panel refers to the growth rate of the unstable wave. The higher value of

growth rate (0,14) corresponds to a wavenumber of 1.29, which gives a wavelength

of 4.87 Rd. If we re-scaled this value by Rd, we obtain a dimensional wavelength of

175 km. This value in within the range of the BC paired eddies depicted in Figure 1.9.

The wavelength of 175 km is correspondent to the most unstable wave obtained by the

linear model, and might indicate that the BC is potentially unstable for the generations

of a unstable wave of the same order of the previously observed mesoscale features.

The phase velocity plot confirm the propagation of the unstable wave southward, since

it presents negative values only. The mean phase velocity was of -0.18, while the mean

group velocity was of -0.31.

3.3 Nonlinear results and discussion

Here we present the experiment conducted for the nonlinear model. The initial condi-

tions of this model were obtained from the linear model, where we used the informa-

tions of front positions x?i and the PV jumps ?i (see Table 3.2). We considered that the

cyclonic eddy off Cape Frio, which is a recurrent feature present in the area, can trigger

barotropically unstable waves inside the southeast Brazilian oceanic region. Hence, we

assumed the meander can make the jet unstable and, because of that, we used appro-

priate values to excite the jet within possible wavenumbers from Cape Frio eddy. In

the absence of mechanisms to generate a Cape Frio-like eddy in the model, we used a

initial perturbation in the jet in the form of a cos bump. The perturbation equation is

presented in Equation 3.44

where we used as the wave amplitude A = 1, the function width w = 1.5 and the

most unstable wavenumber (from the linear model) k0 = 1.29 (all the values are non-

dimensional). This multilobed anomaly sets k0 as the dominant wavenumber, and the

width w determines the extent to which wavelengths neighboring k0 are present.

The results of the temporal evolution of the initial disturbance are illustrated in Fig-

ure 3.4. The jet is meridionally oriented and it is propagating southward. The upper

left panel illustrates the initial state of the model, where there is a bump perturbation

upstream. The central front (at x = 1.55) represents the jet core. We can see the down-

stream evolution of the fronts the in following days. In day 10, an eddy was formed at

each side of the jet. In day 15, a dipole start to grow upstream, while eddies continue to

be formed right downstream. At the end of the simulation (day 25), the jet evolved to a



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 44

scenario where paired eddies were generated upstream, close to the perturbation loca-

tion. This result correspond to the results obtained by Pereira [2009] and Velhote [1998],

where the dipole (paired eddies) were observed close to Cape Frio. Downstream, the

pattern is like a vortex street (Bell &amp;amp; Pratt [1992]), such as the scenario described by

Campos et al. [1996] in the southeast region of the Brazilian continental margin.

It is possible to note that the presence of the western wall limits the spatial growth

of the features in the coastal side. We performed a simulation with the same jet charac-

teristics, but in a open ocean domain (no boundaries), and could see the differences. In

the open domain, the same structures were formed, but they could spatially grow and

became more organized. In the case presented here, the features seem to shrink due to

the solid wall, and the eddies are more distorted.

The wave typical length scale in our simulation was about 4.5 Rd, which gives a

dimensional value of 162 km. The most unstable wave obtained in the linear model

results were of 175 km (4.8 Rd). Therefore, the nonlinear evolution could reproduce a

pattern in accordance with the linear characteristics of the jet.

The results presented here conducted us to verify that a barotropically unstable jet

within a simple and limited framework of piecewise constant PV fronts can generate

dipoles and also a sequence of non-paired eddies that propagate downstream. In other

words, a model with a PV structure that is able to support the vortex dipole forma-

tion in its minimal form satisfactorily reproduced the main characteristics of the BC

dipoles described in the literature from observations. In the next chapter, we will relax

the oversimplified piecewise constant PV field and allow the q structure to be quasi-

continuous horizontally. Also, we will seek to examine the dynamical effect of a curvy

coastline besides the investigation of WBC jets flowing adjacent to a meridional coast.

In order to do that, we will calibrate the model with the jet characteristics obtained in

Chapter 2 and we will consider that wavelength of approximately 175 km can occur

(e.g. eddies of about 87 km), which is the wavelength of the most unstable barotropic

waves that the BC jet can excite.

Finally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 2 and 3 presented in Sec-

tion 1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we obtained the linear instability

properties of the observed jet, isolated the effect of barotropic instability and examined



CHAPTER 3. THE CONTOUR DYNAMICS MODEL 45

the nonlinear evolution of the jet in a CD model.

Chapter 4

The quasigeostrophic numerical model

In order to bring more complexity and reality to our idealized physical system, here

we will present the methodology developed and the analysis conducted for a multi-

front (quasi-continuous) PV field. Given the fact that being more realistic regarding

the horizontal structure of the idealized ocean, the CD technique would become very

complex to solve. The other approach presented here is essentially a numerical model

under the quasigeostrophic (QG) approximation. It allows, besides a quasi-continuous

PV field, the implementation of solid boundaries, both rectilinear and curvilinear.

We intended to investigate the downstream evolution of an idealized prescribed

jet which was set to be potentially barotropically unstable, in order to see the possible

development of instabilities translated in eddies and/or dipoles. Since our statement

(presented in Chapter 1) is that bipolar features are formed due to barotropic instabil-

ities, here we aimed to isolate this phenomenon in a 2-dimensional QG model. Using

the information obtained in Chapter 2, this jet was calibrated with the BC characteris-

tics in terms of horizontal scale and velocity magnitude.

We investigated the behavior of a meridional southward jet under the barotropic

and equivalent-barotropic approximations. Trying to start from the simplest scenario

and evolve to a more complex one, we considered 3 different cases. The first consisted

of a meridional jet centered in a open domain. The second consisted of meridional jet

flowing along a straight western boundary inside a meridional channel. In the third

one, we added a variant coastline, and we investigated the behavior of the jet inter-

acting with this perturbation, again inside a meridional channel. The idea was to con-

47



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 48

struct a theoretical understanding regarding the development of barotropic instabili-

ties in a BC-like jet through the investigation of the two simplest QG dynamical cases:

the 1-layer barotropic case and the 11/2-layer equivalent-barotropic case. Although the

latter consists of a dynamical simplification more in accordance with the BC system off

Cape Frio, the barotropic study will be the baseline in which we know the interaction

of a meridional simple jet with a more complex western boundary. Moreover, although

the dipoles formation is located in a region where the CB is very baroclinic, there are

evidences of the downstream propagation of these structures (resembling a wave pat-

tern composed by cyclones and anticyclones) into a region where the BC tends to be

more barotropic, since the current vertical extension reaches deeper levels as it flows

southwestward.

4.1 Methodology

The model is essentially the quasigeostrophic one described in Jayne et al. [1996] and

Waterman &amp;amp; Jayne [2011]. However, while the authors investigated a zonal eastward jet

along an infinite zonal channel, here we considered a meridional southward jet. Then,

our analysis is based on the along-stream evolution of an idealized WBC jet using a nu-

merical model of an unstable, boundary forced jet in a meridionally-oriented channel.

The QG model is on the f plane, and fully nonlinear, with x (zonal direction), y (merid-

ional direction) and time dependence, and it is dimensional. The model is forced at the

northern boundary by imposing a jet inflow directed southward and it is scaled appro-

priate to the BC extension. We solve a modified conservation of PV equation, where,

instead of considering the balance in Equation 2.6, we opted to include a dissipation

term. This was done in order to facilitate dealing with some numerical issues, such as

giving stability to the model and to configure an inflow-outflow condition. Hence, our

new PV equation (for a inviscid ocean) is

?

?t
q + J(?,q) = ?R?2?, (4.1)

where R is the bottom friction coefficient (which scales as t?1) and ?2 is the horizon-

tal Laplacian operator. Again, q is our QG potential vorticity (QGPV) and ? is the



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 49

streamfunction. Then, q is defined in the 1-layer (2-dimensional) case as

q = ?2?, (4.2)

and for the 11/2-layer case (for the dynamical active upper layer)

q = ?2? ?
?

R2d
. (4.3)

where Rd is the first baroclinic deformation radius.

Therefore, Equation 4.1 is applied in a 2-dimensional channel with size L x W, where

W = L/2, and has a uniform grid spacing of dx = dy = 15 km. We have tested a few

values for L, since according to Berloff &amp;amp; McWilliams [1999], the channel length and

width may influence the dynamics of the interior because they are a parameter of the

model. So we tried to investigate the proper size willing to chose a length big enough to

avoid such influence. Based on that, and following Jayne et al. [1996], we used L = 6000

km. Additionally, we chose 15 km of resolution since we are expecting wavelengths

of order 175 km (according to the previous chapter), which would allow eddies of

about 87 km of diameter. Therefore, 15 km seems to be an appropriate value to allow

the occurrence of those eddies. In other words, such grid spacing is nearly ”eddy-

resolving” for the eddy dimensions we are expecting to obtain.

Integration in space is done using a scheme that is center differenced in the two spa-

tial dimensions (an ”Arakawa C-grid”) with flux-limited advection. The integration in

time is done using a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme. The model is forced by

inflow-outflow conditions. The inflowing jet is potentially barotropically unstable, i.e.

it satisfies the Rayleigh necessary condition for instability, requiring the potential vor-

ticity gradient profile to change sign in the horizontal. The inflowing mass must be

removed from the domain at the southern boundary, and it is important to the rele-

vance of this study to the along-stream development of a WBC jet that the northern

boundary condition does not control the upstream dynamics we study. We make the

upstream dynamics qualitatively insensitive to the outflow condition by making the

meridional extent of the domain long relative to the meridional extent we examine and

through a meridionally broad northern boundary sponge layer, which allows the jet to

adjust to the outflow condition near the northern boundary. The bottom friction coeffi-

cient varies linearly within the channel, and it was chosen to make the inflow-outflow



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 50

regions stable (steady-state condition), and to make the interior flow to be marginally

stable (allowing only weak instabilities). Then R ? (900 days)?1 within the sponge lay-

ers and R ? (1 day)?1 in the interior (such as in Jayne et al. [1996]). No normal flow

is allowed at the eastern and western walls and, following again Berloff &amp;amp; McWilliams

[1999], no-slip boundary condition is applied at the western one. According to the au-

thors, the no-slip boundary condition is adequate to allow jet instabilities, and it is not

the case of the free-slip one, which has a stabilizing effect on the flow in a nonlinear

regime. Verron et al. [1991] also used no-slip boundary condition in the investigation of

a flow past a cape in a QG framework, and mentioned that in the free-slip, no eddy-

shedding is observed (see Berloff &amp;amp; McWilliams [1999] for a discussion). In the scenario

we have a variant (curvy) western boundary, the same boundary conditions apply, and

the coastline is handled with a capacitance matrix approach.

Therefore, we allow the jet to evolve freely in the meridional direction from the

northern edge of the domain, and remove it at the southern edge a long way down-

stream and in a manner that does not affect the upstream (interior) dynamics we study.

Note that, although we do not run the model for a long integration time, the presence

of the sponge layer on the northern boundary in particular has the effect of eliminat-

ing any feedback of possible recirculation strength on the inflowing jet, and as such

eliminates the potential for more complex behavior associated with the low-frequency

variability or multiple dynamical regimes observed in WBC systems, a complicating

feature we wished to eliminate from the system we studied.

The jet is a function of a sech2 (e.g. a Bickley jet), where the steady-state meridional

velocity is defined as

v(x) = vosech
2

(
x?xc
?

)
, (4.4)

where, vo is a constant that determines the velocity magnitude, ? is a normalization

factor (function decay) proportional to the jet width and xc is the position of the core

velocity. The Bickley jet was chosen based on studies that have investigated the sta-

bility problem of geophysical flows using this type of function. For instance, Lipps

[1963] investigated the effect of the horizontal mass divergence upon the stability of a

barotropic flow under the equivalent-barotropic approximation using a zonal jet pre-



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 51

scribed as

U(y) = V sech2
(y

)
+ V0, (4.5)

where V ,L and V0 are constants. He derived the stability problem of this jet, obtained a

sufficient condition for stability, and applied the stability theory to a Gulf Stream-like

jet, where he could compute the most unstable wavelength. Other references that had

applied a Bickley jet are Mallier &amp;amp; Davis [1999], Jayne &amp;amp; Hogg [1999], Cunningham [2000]

and Bouchut et al. [2011].

All the results presented here consider we are in the Southern Hemisphere, e.g.

f &amp;lt;0. Therefore, we referenced “cyclonic” as clockwise circulation and “anticyclonic”

as counter-clockwise circulation.

4.2 The barotropic case

All the evaluation done in the previous chapters considered the approximation of the

BC observed jet in a 11/2-layer ocean. This consideration is more in accordance with

the real BC scenario, where the BC flows above the IWBC. However, since we aim

to verify whether barotropic instabilities can generate dipoles along the BC-like jet,

the evaluation of the purely barotropic configuration is also relevant. However, the

barotropic QG approximation of the observed BC flow would not be possible, since

a vertical integration of transport in the BC-IWBC system would be nearly zero. As

an alternative to that, we opted for prescribing a meridional jet by functions in which

their constant parameters can be calibrated in order to generate a jet with the same

kinematics characteristics as the observed BC of Figure 2.6. In the present barotropic

case, we evolved Equation 4.1 considering q of Equation 4.2.

4.2.1 Open domain

It is natural to think that the investigation of the BC dynamics involves the presence

of a western boundary. However, looking to the BC flow off Cape Frio scenario, the

current, attached to the continental margin north of Cape Frio, encounters open waters

when passing by this location. In an idealized study, we can think in a scenario where a

jet, perturbed upstream, leaves the indentation and flows in a open domain. Waterman



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 52

&amp;amp; Jayne [2011] used a similar idea in their theoretical study on the role of eddy-mean

flow interactions in the time-mean dynamics of a zonally evolving, unstable, strongly

inertial jet in a configuration and parameter regime that is relevant to the Kuroshio

extension (e.g., after the jet separates of the western boundary). Their idealized jet

was perturbed upstream (at the inflow) and was allowed to evolve in a zonal channel

configured as a open domain. Considering this idea, we believe the investigation of the

open domain scenario as very relevant to our study, since we are trying to construct a

theoretical understanding of the BC dynamics off Cape Frio region and we are focusing

on process-based study.

Therefore, the sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a channel of open boundaries in

a grid size of 6000x3000 km, which was big enough so the boundaries did not have

any influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the features that had appeared dur-

ing the runs remained in the interior of the channel. The integration time was 300

days (about 1 year), so we could see the model reach an equilibrium state, that will

be discussed ahead. We placed the jet flowing along the center of the channel. Hence,

one experiment was conducted with a jet that presented BC kinematics characteristics.

Such experiment is presented in Table 4.1, in which the values are correspondent to the

inflowing steady-state jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ?

(described in Equation 4.4 and jetw (jet width). The parameter ? was set with the same

value of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).

Figure 4.1 (upper panel) shows the initial velocity profiles at the inflow for each

case. Figure 4.2 illustrates the initial q and ? horizontal fields. In all the following

representation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel

will be shown (the interior). For the open ocean case, the jet was initially perturbed,

otherwise, the jet would be totally stable in this configuration. The perturbation used

here is in the form of a noise applied on the PV field.



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 53

As we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2 and in the previous section, we

computed the Rayleigh and Fjørtoft conditions, that give us the necessary but not suffi-

cient conditions for barotropic instabilities. In Rayleigh condition, ?q/?x should change

signal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. In Fjørtoft condition, a similar

expression states a more robust condition, which is (v? ? vo)?q/?x, and should be pos-

itive at least in one portion of the cross-jet direction. Figure 4.1 center panel shows

the Rayleigh condition computed, and Figure 4.1 lower panel shown the Fjørtoft one.

In the present case, ?q/?x and (v? ? vo)?q/?x changes sign at least once in the cross-jet

direction.

The time evolution of the 1-layer open ocean case is shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4,

q and ? horizontal fields respectively. The jet starts meandering up to day 30, when

it begins the formation of quasi-paired eddies of opposite signs at each side of the

current, that propagate with the flow. Two bipolar features grow and last until the end

of the run, and they can be seen in the velocity arrows over the ? field of Figure 4.4.

The jet gets broken in eddies, but the main flow still lasts, and the jet axis is kept. In

general, the eddies formed until day 90 had size of approximately 200 km in diameter,

same scale as the initial jet width. However, the two dipoles that developed later ended

up growing and reached about 400 km. These large scale features presented a slow-

propagating pattern by the end of the run, so we considered that, from this moment,

the results were not relevant to our investigation anymore. The propagation of the

features along the channel was approximately 11 km day?1.

4.2.2 Straight western boundary

The sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a channel with a straight western boundary , and

in a 6000x3000 km size configuration, which was big enough so the boundaries did not

have any influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the features that had appeared

during the runs remained in the interior of the channel. The integration time was 300

days (about 1 year), so we could see the model reach an equilibrium state, that will be

discussed ahead. We constructed several experiments in which we varied the distance

of the jet core (xc) from the coast, which gave us different jet profiles. We selected 4

cases: xc = 100 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 30 km and xc = 10 km. Table 4.2 summarizes

these experiments, in which the values are correspondent to the inflowing steady-state

jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? described in Equation

4.4 and jetw (jet width). In all the cases we fixed ? as having the same value of the

deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).

Figure 4.5 shows the initial velocity profiles at the inflow for each case. Figure 4.6

and 4.7 illustrates the initial q and ? horizontal fields. In all the following represen-

tation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel will be

shown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. For the straight coast cases, the jet was ini-

tially perturbed, otherwise, without no source of instability, the jet would be totally

stable in this configuration. The perturbation was the same used for the previous open

ocean case (a small noise). Looking to these figures, one can see that the inflowing jet

is directed southward. In each given xc, the jet core gets closer to the wall.

As we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2, we computed the Rayleigh and

bust condition, which is (v? ? vo)?q/?x, and also should change signal at least once in

the horizontal cross-jet direction. Figure 4.8 shows the Rayleigh condition we com-

puted for each case, and Figure 4.9 shown the Fjørtoft one. In all the cases, ?q/?x and

(v??vo)?q/?x changes sign at least once in the cross-jet direction. However, as the jet gets

far away from the coast, more sign changes occur, which may indicates that the jet is

getting more potentially unstable.

The time evolution of the 4 cases are shown in Figures 4.10 to 4.17. The xc = 100 km

case is when the jet is more unstable. It starts meandering and afterwards breaking up

in eddies and bipolar features. Those dipoles propagate with the flow and becomes

non-paired after a while. In this case, a dipole detaches from the main current and

recirculates in the interior. Moreover, after about 80 days, eddy-wall interaction takes

place, forming a counter-current between the southward jet and the wall. This is the

case we can consider that the jet was unstable enough to generate strong instabilities,

and the nonlinear effects are predominant and dominate the dynamics of the system,

mainly after 100 days. Before that, the propagation of the features along channel was

approximately 6 km day ?1. The typical length scale of the eddies was approximately

130 km in diameter.

In xc = 60 km, the jet gets unstable latter than the previous case. The initial dipoles

propagate with the jet and leave the domain by the southern boundary. Upstream,

close to the inflow area, a dipole forms and shifts the jet slightly to the interior, which

gives space for a cyclonic eddy to develop between the wall and the jet, and a eddy-

wall interaction starts. This eddy-wall process starts after 150 days, and at this point,

the dipole formed recirculates in the interior. The cyclone, instead of evolving to a

counter-current, stays stationary (centered in the 4000 km of the y axis) until the dipole

totally recirculates and be absorbed by the jet. From this moment, the impinging dipole

interacts with the jet and an eddy-wall interaction starts again, forming a counter-

current from day 290. Downstream, the jet keeps flowing southward, characterized by

a sequence of cyclone and anticyclones that leave the domain by the southern bound-

ary. The propagation of the features along channel was approximately 7.5 km day ?1.

The typical length scale of the eddies was approximately 120 km in diameter.

The jet behavior in xc = 30 km case is very similar to the xc = 60 km. The main



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 59

difference is in the time things start to happen, that is latter in the present one. In

summary, the jet also develops vortex dipoles along the main axis, and one dipole

detaches from the current and recirculates. However, it seems there is a tendency of

the jet to stabilize after about 270 days. Moreover, the recirculated dipole is absorbed

by the current and does not trigger any new instability in the jet. The propagation of

the features along channel was approximately 7 km day ?1. The typical length scale of

the eddies was approximately 130 km in diameter.

In xc = 10 km case, the jet is much more stable, meandering and forming less eddies.

The anticyclonic ones are predominant, since there exists only the anticyclonic part of

the jet in this case. Any eddy detaches from the main flow, and they propagate with

the current southward and leave the domain throughout the southern boundary. The

jet starts getting stable upstream as the time goes by, and the formation of eddies stays

restricted to the downstream region. The propagation of the features along channel

was approximately 15 km day ?1. The typical length scale of the eddies around day 50

was approximately 120 km in diameter. Latter (by day 140), the eddies presented some

growth and reached about 220 km.

In all the four case, the model reached what we considered an equilibrium state

by day 300, e.g. in xc = 10 km, the jet presented a steady-state pattern, while in the

others, it was observed the presence of large scale features which were having a nearly

steady-state behavior as well (no growth and no propagation). In both situation, we

considered the dynamics as not relevant to our analyzes anymore.

4.2.3 Curvy western boundary

In the curvy western boundary scenario, the coast shape was idealistic constructed

to resemble the southeast Brazilian coastline. Then we used a tanh function and chose

appropriate values to meet the curvature radius of the real coast. The meridional coast-

line profile prescribed is represented by Equation 4.6:

CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 73

and the correspondent curvature radius is R = 1/K. We computed K for the 200 m

isobath curve from ETOPO 1 database in Cape Frio region and obtained an approxi-

mate R = 149 km close to the point where the coastline changes direction. We did the

same to the idealized coastline profile of Equation 4.6 and obtained R = 150 km. There-

fore, the idealized coastline used for the present scenario has a very similar (although

smoothed) profile of the real one that is actually “felt” by the WBC (that’s the reason

why we used the 200 m isobath as reference). Still in Equation 4.6, the value of 300

was chosen to sets a realistic difference in the distance between the easternmost and

the westernmost regions of Cape Frio area.

We performed a few tests in which we varied the value of the curvature radius,

ranging between a smooth varying coastline to a steep one. The results showed us

that the smoother the coastline variation is, the latter the jet starts getting unstable. We

opted for fixing a given and appropriate value of curvature radius and perform tests

in which we varied the jet profile, as we did in the previous section.

Therefore, the sech2 jet (Equation 4.4) was run in a meridional channel that was

set again to a 6000x3000 km size configuration. Such configuration was big enough

so the boundaries did not have any influence on the dynamics of the interior, and the

features that had appeared during the runs remained in the interior of the channel.

The integration time was 600 days (about 2 year, double of the previous), so we could

see the model reach an equilibrium state, that will be discussed ahead. As mentioned,

we constructed several experiments in which we varied the distance of the jet core

from the coast, which gave us different jet profiles. We selected the same 4 cases as

the previous section: xc = 100 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 30 km and xc = 10 km. Table 4.3

summarizes these experiments, in which the values are correspondent to the inflowing

steady-state jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? (described

in Equation 4.4) and jetw (jet width). In all the cases we fixed ? as having the same

value of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).

Figure 4.18 shows the initial velocity profiles at the inflow for each case. Figure 4.19

and 4.20 illustrates the initial q and ? horizontal fields. In all the following represen-

tation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel will be

shown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. For the curvy coast case, we did not per-

turbed the jet initially, since the change in coastline direction is enough to make the jet

unstable, and this is the effect we want to isolate. Looking to these figures, one can see

that the inflowing jet is directed southward. In each given xc, the jet gets closer to the

wall.

Figure 4.21 shows the Rayleigh condition we computed for each case, and Figure

4.22 shown the Fjørtoft one. In all the cases, ?q/?x and (v? ? vo)?q/?x changes sign at

least once in the cross-jet direction. However, as the jet gets far away from the coast,

more sign changes occurs, which may indicates that the jet is getting more potentially

unstable.

The time evolution of the 4 cases are shown in Figures 4.23 to 4.30. The xc = 100

km case is when the jet is more unstable. The current is initially located attached to the

western boundary. As soon as the jet encounters the coastline indentation, it ”feels”

the coastline absence and has room to develop instabilities. It initially forms a dipole,

which sets the path for the trailing jet. As the jet tries to return to the western boundary,

it presents a eddy-shedding mode. First an anticyclone (clockwise eddy) forms, and

afterwards, a cyclone occurs at the lee of the indentation. An eddy-wall interaction

occurs in the coastal side of the jet, while a recirculation starts in the interior side,

which formed a large scale bipolar structure of about 1500 km in total diameter. The jet

keeps detached from the coast until the end of the run and presents an eddy-shedding

mode downstream. Typical length scales of these eddies were approximately 200 km,

and the propagation of the features was approximately 8 km day?1.

In xc = 60 km case, the jet behavior was very similar. It also forms a dipole initially,



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 75

which sets the path for the trailing jet. As the jet gets close to the western boundary, this

dipole grows and detaches from the jet and travels to the interior. At the same time,

eddy-wall interaction occurs in the coastal side, forming a lee-eddy that also grows and

propagates northward, reaching the jet upstream. This scenario characterized the for-

mation of a large scale slow-propagation dipole. Typical length scales of these eddies

were approximately 400 km, and the propagation of the features was approximately 7

km day?1.

The xc = 30 km case is more stable than the previous cases. Initially there is the

formation of a dipole, that recirculates in the interior and has the anticyclonic part (that

grows) bigger than the cyclonic part (which vanishes after some time). During this

recirculation, it is noticeable the jet tries to return to the western boundary. After about

200 days, the jet is attached again to the wall, a lee-eddy forms and the recirculation

remain quasi-stationary. Typical length scales of these eddies were approximately 300

km, and the propagation of the features was approximately 8 km day?1.

In xc = 10 km case, the jet is much more stable, meandering and forming less ed-

dies. The anticyclonic ones are predominant, since there exists only the anticyclonic

part of the jet in this case. Any eddy detaches from the main flow, and they propagate

with the current southward and leave the domain throughout the southern boundary.

The jet gets stable after 180 days. The propagation of the features along channel was

approximately 10 km day?1 close to the indentation, but south of 4000 km, the prop-

agation velocity increases to 25 km day?1. The typical length scale of the eddies was

approximately 150 km in diameter.

In all the four case, the model reached what we considered an equilibrium state

by day 300. In xc = 10 km, the jet presented a steady-state pattern (before 300 days),

while in the others, it was observed the formation of large scale features, which pre-

sented a slow-propagating pattern. In both situation, we considered the dynamics as

not relevant to our investigation anymore.

4.3 The equivalent-barotropic case

Here we evolved Equation 4.1 considering q of Equation 4.3, and such dynamical ap-

proximation is more in accordance with the BC scenario off Cape Frio region. We are

still focusing on barotropic instabilities, and again the equivalent-barotropic approx-

imation is very appropriate. The prescribed jet was the sech2 one of Equation 4.4,

calibrated with the BC characteristics obtained in Chapter 2. The study conducted for

the 11/2-layer approximation consists only of the open domain case.

4.3.1 Open domain

Considering the same arguments presented in Section 4.2.1, we investigated a merid-

ional BC-like jet in a 11/2-layer open domain model. The model consisted of a channel

with size 6000x3000 km, and we run for 300 days, which means about 1 year. Here

we tested one jet profile, such as in Section 4.2.1. Table 4.4 summarizes the 11/2-layer

model experiment, in which the values are correspondent to the inflowing steady-state

jet. The parameters based on the BC characteristics are: vo, xc, ? (described in Equation

4.4) and jetw (jet width). Such as in the previous sections, we fixed ? as having the

same value of the deformation radius computed for the BC in Chapter 2 (Rd = 36 km).

Figure 4.31 (upper panel) shows the initial velocity profiles at the inflow for each

case. Figure 4.32 illustrates the initial q and ? horizontal fields. In all the following

representation of the horizontal fields, only the dynamical relevant part of the channel

will be shown, e.g. the inflow and interior areas. Here, the jet was initially perturbed,

otherwise, without no source of instability, the jet would be totally stable in this con-

figuration. The perturbation was the same used for the previous cases (a small noise).

Looking to these figures, one can see that the inflowing jet is directed southward.



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 90

As we have done for the BC profile in Chapter 2 and in the previous section, we

computed the Rayleigh and Fjørtoft conditions, that give us the necessary but not suffi-

cient conditions for barotropic instabilities. In Rayleigh condition, ?q/?x should change

signal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. In Fjørtoft condition, a simi-

lar expression states a more robust condition, which is (v? ? vo)?q/?x, and also should

change signal at least once in the horizontal cross-jet direction. Figure 4.31 center panel

shows the Rayleigh condition we computed for each case, and Figure 4.31 lower panel

shown the Fjørtoft one. In the present case, ?q/?x and (v? ?vo)?q/?x changes sign at least

once in the cross-jet direction.

The time evolution of the 11/2-layer case is shown in Figures 4.33 to 4.36. Here

both time and length scales differ considerable from the barotropic case. The first dif-

ference was in the integration time period. We run this case for 600 days (double of

the barotropic cases), since the jet started presenting variations much latter. However,

even at advanced days, the jet was much more stable than the barotropic cases. It

showed a meandering pattern, but any eddy developed, since we could not see any

arrow closing in circles in the velocity fields. The propagation was typically around 6

km day?1 southward. The typical wavelength of the propagating meanders was of 200

km during the entire run.

CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 97

4.4 Summary and Discussion

In the present chapter, we used a QG numerical model to study the downstream evolu-

tion of a potentially barotropically unstable jet. We aimed to investigate and construct

a theoretical understanding of the interaction of a southward flowing jet with the lat-

eral boundary, and this jet was prescribed based on the BC kinematic characteristics

of the observed current presented in Chapter 4. In order to understand the behavior

of the jet, we selected three different scenarios. The first was the open ocean domain,

where we evolved a free inertial jet over the interior of the open ocean. It was our

intent to disregard the effect of the coastline in order the analyze the simplest scenario.

Although dynamically simpler, we considered this case relevant and appropriate to

study the BC dynamics, since the BC, after passing by Cape Frio, actually encounters

open waters. Waterman &amp;amp; Jayne [2011] considered the same idea in a theoretical study

of the downstream evolution of an idealized Kuroshio current after the separation from

the western boundary. The second scenario was a meridional channel domain with a

rectilinear western boundary. The effect of the presence of a wall was included and the

jet was imposed flowing attached to it. The third one consisted of a meridional channel

domain with a curvilinear western boundary. The jet was also imposed attached along

the wall initially, and the western boundary was construct to resemble the Cape Frio

region coastline profile. For the three scenarios, we used the barotropic approximation,

and the equivalent-barotropic was applied only in the open ocean domain case.

The barotropic cases gave us a baseline regarding the interaction of a jet in the

simplest QG approximation. In open waters, the jet was initially perturbed (a noise

perturbation along the entire PV field), otherwise the inflowing steady-state jet would

not present variation, since no perturbations were imposed along the domain (such

as topographic or lateral variations). In this case, the jet developed a sequence of op-

posing sign eddies along the channel, results very similar to the scenario presented

by Bell &amp;amp; Pratt [1992], in what they called a ”vortex street”. The eddies presented the

same length scale of the jet horizontal extension and propagated southward, leaving

the domain by the southern boundary.

In the straight coast scenario, we presented four cases. In each one, we changed

the distance of the jet core from the coast, which means we varied the parameter xc



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 98

of Equation 4.4. The change in the jet core position generated different jet profiles.

The low xc case (xc = 10 km) presented a lower jet width and the horizontal shear

was restricted to the oceanic side. With the increasing of xc, the jet had a bigger hor-

izontal width and more horizontal shear was gradually added in the coastal side of

the jet. Consequently, as we increased xc, the jet seemed to be more unstable, and

more inflexion points in the Rayleigh and Fjørtoft criteria were seen. Although we had

tested many values of xc, here we considered relevant to present four cases: xc = 10

km, xc = 30 km, xc = 60 km, xc = 100 km. We also imposed an initial perturbation

along the jet, and allowed the flow to respond to it. Besides xc = 10 km case, the jet

generate bipolar features downstream as paired eddies that propagated southward, so

barotropic instabilities actually occurred. A dipole detached from the jet and recircu-

lated in the interior. Eddy-wall interaction as an ”image effect” was observed in xc =

100 km case, and for values higher than 100 km, the jet presented strong eddy-wall

interaction and a more ”chaotic” behavior. Therefore, xc = 100 km was approximately

the upper limit that separates a weak perturbed continuous flow regime from a highly

unstable regime, not in accordance with typical WBC flows. The xc = 10 km case pre-

sented a very stable behavior. A weak meandering pattern was observed, where the

anticyclones were more prominent. One anticyclonic eddy was formed, but it traveled

with the jet and left the domain through the southern boundary.

Comparing the open ocean domain with the straight coast channel, the main dif-

ference was the formation of a recirculating dipole, generated upstream, close to the

jet inflow. The horizontal shear in both sides of the current is clearly important for the

generation of vortex dipoles and the vortex street patterns observed, and these are sce-

narios comparable with the BC in southeast area of the Brazilian continental margin.

In the curvy coastline scenario, we tested the same four xc values and allowed the

jet to interact with a variant coastline, which was idealistic constructed to resemble

the real one off Cape Frio region. No perturbations were imposed initially, since we

intended to isolate the effect of the coast variation. Such perturbation was sufficient

to make the jet unstable in all the four cases. Initially, a dipole was formed close to

the indentation area and set the path for the trailing jet. In general, the trailing jet

developed a cyclone, which located at the lee of the coastline indentation at least for



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 99

some time. The initial dipole recirculated and was absorbed latter by the flow. The

higher values of xc presented eddy-wall interaction at some point in the run and the

xc = 100 km case limited the weak perturbed continuous flow regime from a highly

unstable regime, where nonlinearities dominate the dynamics.. As the jet core got

closer to the wall, it was clearer the tendency of returning to the western boundary.

Comparing the curvy coastline with the straight coastline scenario, similar behaviors

were observed. Dipoles were formed initially, and a meandering pattern composed

by eddies of opposing sign was observed downstream. In the xc = 10 km cases, the

jet presented similar behavior as well, where we had a very stable flow that formed

one anticyclone that propagated southward and left the domain. It was also noticed

that in both cases, as the jet got closer to the wall, it became more stable, and it started

generating features latter.

In the 11/2-layer case, we have presented one case, which was a initially perturbed

jet in a open ocean domain. The jet started developing perturbations much latter than

the 1-layer one, and a meandering pattern was observed, resembling a southward-

propagating wave with wavelength of 200 km and 6 km day?1 of phase velocity. Al-

though we could set up the 11/2-layer approximation only for the open domain sce-

nario, it seems the relatively weak stratification effect can produce differences in the

flow. Comparing the two open ocean domain cases, the length scales of the features

were very similar, but the time scales differed, where the 1-layer case had approxi-

mately the double of the propagation velocity of the 11/2-layer case. Flierl [1999] applied

an hybrid model (with piecewise constant potential vorticity in the upper layer and a

deep layer initially at rest) and a contour dynamics model and demonstrated that, the

barotropic mode plays a fundamental role in the long-wave dynamics. For f plane jets,

it leads to unstable waves whereas the n1/2-layer models have stable waves. Ring for-

mation appears to occur via an initial stage of baroclinic growth - a ”heton” mechanism

whereby opposite-signed upper and lower layer PV anomalies propel each other away

from the jet axis. At latter stages, the equivalent-barotropic dynamics acts to pinch off

the eddy. Comparing his results with the ones we obtained here, we did have a more

stable jet in the open ocean 11/2-layer case, where a stable wave pattern was obtained.

Additionally, they showed the importance of the baroclinic effect in generating eddies,



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 100

so we imagine that this approximation would promote the development of eddies in

our idealized scenarios. The equivalent-barotropic study certainly must be better ex-

plored, in the sense of including this approximation in a channel and considering a

curvy coastline. Moreover, from the preliminary results we obtained here, it seems

the model parameters and scales applied did not work as good as for the barotropic

approximation, since no eddies grew. Probably, the baroclinic approximation excite

unstable wavelengths that are different from the barotropic one, and our model con-

figuration could not allow these wavelengths to manifest. In other words, we need to

study what the ideal scales are when configuring a baroclinic jet, even in its simplest

approximation.

The results obtained in xc = 100 km and xc = 60 km for the curvy coastline de-

serves special attention. The initial vortex dipole evolved to a scenario of southward-

propagating opposing signs eddies located upstream, at least during some periods of

the runs. Such dipole also seemed to trigger instabilities downstream, translated in a

southward-propagating wave pattern. This specific situations resembled the observed

pictures we presented in Chapter 1 for the BC off Cape Frio and southeast Brazilian

coast, illustrated again in Figure 4.38. It seems the indentation triggers the formation

of a vortex-dipole, which besides setting the path for the trailing jet, made it unstable

and favorable to develop new eddies right upstream. The dipole eventually detached

from the jet, but the current remained unstable and evolved to a scenario of opposing

signs eddies. We have selected four snapshots to illustrate this description, and they

can be seen in Figure 4.37. It is important to point out that the comparison is merely

qualitative. The scales of the observed features in Figure 4.38 are much smaller than

the scales we obtained in the runs, and it is expected since the purely barotropic scales

are greater. Verron et al. [1991] mentioned that studies that had investigated the dynam-

ics of a flow past a cape under the homogeneous rotating QG framework obtained, in

general, eddies forming at the apex, either propagating downstream as isolated eddies

or combining to form larger scale eddies. In the snapshots of Figure 4.37, right panels,

we also obtained this combination of eddies that formed larger features, although here

we have an indentation instead of a cape. After day 300, the eddies combined to form

growing slow-propagating large scale features until the end of the run. Still in Verron



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 101

et al. [1991], they also investigated the evolution of a eastward zonal flow past a cape

under the homogeneous (barotropic) QG framework, and tested different cases where

they varied the Reynolds number Re. This parameter compares the strength of the jet

with the friction intensity, and is defined as Re = UL/? (U and L are the typical veloc-

ity and length scales of the jet, and ? is the fluid turbulent viscosity). Re appears in

the nondimensional PV equation when considering the importance of lateral friction.

They obtained attached lee anticyclones (clockwise rotation since they were consider-

ing northern hemisphere) at the rear face of the cape at low Reynolds number (strong

friction), and for high Reynolds number (weak friction), attached eddies were formed

and shed periodically from the cape. Here we have not tried experiments with the in-

clusion of the lateral friction term, but the comparison with that study is relevant since

here we also dealt with a barotropic QG numerical model. In our results, after the

jet passed by the indentation, it tended to form also a clockwise motion. If we rotate

our reference framework to be equivalent to them, the inflowing jet past the coastline

perturbation demonstrated similar behavior. Here, an eddy-shedding mode was also

observed after the flow passed the indentation, but only in the case where the jet was

closer to the wall. In Verron et al. [1991], this mode was obtained with high Re (e.g.

weak friction), and here we considered a frictionless ocean. Anyways, as we shifted

the jet core offshore, lee eddies started to appear, and we had periods that these eddies

were steady for a considerable time. In our case, the horizontal shear strength at the

coastal side of the jet seems to be comparable to the consideration of lateral friction. A

weak or absent shear (such as in xc = 10 km and xc = 30 km) is equivalent to a weak

friction, and the jet tends to a eddy-shedding regime. In the other hand, a strong shear

(such as in xc = 60 km and xc = 100 km) is equivalent to a stronger friction, and the lee

eddy regime is favored.

Although the effect of vertical shear may play an important role on the dynamics

of the BC off southeast Brazil, and the 11/2- or 2-layer approximation would be more

realistic in terms of dynamical simplifications, the barotropic approximation presented

interesting results already. Barotropic instabilities do generate bipolar features when

the jet presents horizontal shear. Moreover, an eddy-shedding mode is observed after

the dipole formation, at least during an specific period of the integration time. The

CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 104

shear in the coastal side is essential to allow all the process described above to happen.

In all the four cases of the curvy coastline case, it was observed that anticyclonic eddies

were formed more frequently than cyclones. We mentioned the possible importance

of the horizontal shear, in which the oceanic side was always present and it was favor-

able to the formation of anticyclones. However, Verron et al. [1991] pointed out that in

rotating case such as the one they investigated, it was observed asymmetry in terms of

occurrence and form in cyclones and anticyclones. The cyclonic eddies were smaller

and shed slower than the anticyclonic eddies.

A similar study in terms of dynamical approximation was conducted by Munday

&amp;amp; Marshall [2005]. In their investigation, the problem of western boundary current

separation is investigated using a barotropic vorticity model. Specifically, a bound-

ary current flowing poleward along a boundary containing a cape is considered. The

meridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter (the ? effect), the strength of dissipation

(represented by the Reynolds number Re), and the geometry of the cape are varied.

They found that (i) all instances of flow separation are coincident with the presence of

a flow deceleration; (ii) an increase in the strength of the beta effect is able to suppress

flow separation; and (iii) increasing coastline curvature can overcome the suppressive

beta effect and induce separation. They cited that a change in direction of the coastline

can decelerate a boundary current and induce its flow separation. Although we are not

testing a cape shape in our western boundary, some accelerations/deceleration process

might have occurred in our results. Anyways, they obtained that an increase in cur-

vature promotes flow separation, while small curvatures results in an fully attached

flow regime. Although not showed here, we performed a few tests in which we varied

the coastline curvature, and we also obtained the Munday &amp;amp; Marshall [2005] pattern.

Small curvature results in high curvature radius, which results in a smoother coast-

line profile. Hence, it exerts less perturbation in the flow. The smoother the coastline

(e.g., close to a straight coast), the less unstable is the jet. These results regarding coast-

line curvature corroborate the investigation of Stern &amp;amp; Whitehead [1990]. These authors

performed an evaluation of variations in coastline curvature, but the shape was very

similar to our case, e.g., an indentation where the coastline changes direction. They

used the barotropic approximation with no viscous forcing neither variation of plane-



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 105

tary vorticity. They obtained a critical value of the angle of change that separated two

different regimes. A high obtuse angle (small curvature) promotes an eddy attached

regime where the flow tends to pass by the cape attached to the wall or shedding eddies

that propagate downstream. Those eddies were cyclonic in their experiments (counter-

clockwise because f was positive), just like in our results of attached regime. A low

angle (high curvature) makes the jet to separate from the coast and a mushroom-like

structure is formed, setting the path for the trailing jet. Their results also indicate that

perturbations in the coastline can induce the jet to form bipolar features in a homoge-

neous ocean through barotropic instabilities. The dipole formation case also presented

a recirculating pattern, and this was obtained in our results.

Generally speaking, in the 1-layer cases, barotropic instabilities generated bipolar

features. The presence of a simple rectilinear coastline made the dipole to detach from

the jet, but in the curvy coast the jet had room to interact with open water when it sepa-

rates from the indentation. The bipolar features, although apparently very intense, did

not make the jet discontinuous, and this fact made possible the formation of eddies

in the downstream region. Stratification may play an important role in determining

the type of regime a jet presents when interacting with the coastal variations, whether

it is eddy-shedding, eddy-attached and so on. For instance, Magaldi et al. [2008] and

Castelao &amp;amp; Barth [2006] investigated the role of stratification in idealized scenarios of a

flow past a cape using a primitive equation numerical model and could obtain distinct

regimes. Magaldi et al. [2008] designed a fully idealized experiment where a steady jet

impinges on an obstacle (triangular cape) in a rotating and linearly stratified environ-

ment. They kept the small Rossby number constant and did sensitivity runs varying

the Burger Number (Bu),

Bu =

, (4.8)

which measures the ratio between baroclinic deformation radius (Rd) and the length

scale of the obstacle (D). In their experiment of a zonal homogeneous flow (Bu = 0),

they obtained the generation of small anticyclones in the stripe over slope topography

that propagated downstream. For low Bu, e.g., Bu &amp;lt;0.1 (weak stratification), a fully

attached regime is established, and the jet flows smoothly over the cape. For interme-



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 106

diate Bu, e.g., 0.1 &amp;lt;Bu &amp;lt;1, fluid parcels flow more around the obstacle than over

it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies start to shed. The increasing of Bu

shifts the system from a eddy-attached regime (where eddies are formed behind the

cape and shed downstream) to a lee eddy regime (where small lee eddies are formed

and grow behind the cape). For high Bu, e.g., Bu &gt; 1, (strong stratification), tip eddies

merge to form larger eddies in the lee of the cape. Our results are comparable with

the regime of Bu = 0 obtained by the authors, where they obtained the generation of

small anticyclones propagating downstream. The authors mentioned that the presence

of stratification, even if very weak, changes the dynamics considerably.

The discussion above took us to obtain some conclusion. The strength of the jet

horizontal shear determines the regime the flow is going to present. More specifically,

the shear at the coastal side of the jet is key to obtain changes in the unstable jet be-

havior. The absence of shear in the coastal side makes the jet more stable and an eddy

attached or fully attached flow regimes are promoted. As we increase the coastal shear,

the tendency of jet separation also increases, and we obtain two concomitants scenar-

ios: formation of vortex-dipoles and the latter establishment of larger scales lee eddies

followed downstream by other eddies.

It is important to point out that, given the model configuration and initial condi-

tions, we are only allowing the formation of meanders and eddies due to barotropic

instability. Hence, the physical process we had isolated here was the horizontal shear.

Rossby waves and other large scale waves are being filtered here, since the parameter ?

= 0 (we are using the f plane) and we are not considering a sloping bottom (the bottom

is flat). So, we are absolutely not forcing the model with topographic Rossby waves,

although this was one of the processes suggested by Silveira et al. [2000] when he com-

pares the BC scenario off southeast Brazilian coast with the GS warm outbreaks. The

appearance of topographic Rossby waves would be possible if the model could have

at least one region shallower than a second one. The planetary Rossby waves needs

the variation of f to appear, and this effect would be effective only in a zonal jet.

The effect of friction due to the presence of a solid boundary is being ignored here,

although several studies consider this process in determining the formation of vortical

structures and shedding regimes. Another aspect considered to play important role



CHAPTER 4. THE QUASIGEOSTROPHIC NUMERICAL MODEL 107

on the formation of such features is accelerations and decelerations in the flow, which

can be promoted by solid barriers such as capes. Our coastline profile does not have a

barrier effect in the jet, so we think this effect is unlikely to be happening here.

It seems the barotropic approximation requires different temporal and spatial scales

if compared to the approximations that consider the stratification. In our study, the

barotropic scenario comparable to past studies such as Verron et al. [1991] (weak fric-

tion) and Magaldi et al. [2008] (homogeneous ocean) was with xc = 10 km. It seems

that using the same jet (fixed Ro) for both homogeneous and stratified scenarios re-

sults in having a more stable scenario in the equivalent-barotropic case. This is prob-

ably due to the fact that the baroclinic scales excite unstable waves with wavelengths

very different from the barotropic approximation, and the configuration applied in the

QG model could not allow these scales to manifest. So the ”more stable” results actu-

ally indicated the equivalent-barotropic approximation needs adjustments to allow the

baroclinic scales to excite appropriated unstable waves.

Finally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 4 presented in Section

1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we examined the interaction of a

barotropically unstable meridional jet and a western boundary in idealized configu-

rations relevant to BC jet system, in particular the role of lateral boundary variations

in making the jet unstable and able to generate eddies and dipoles. The perturbation

as a varying boundary is sufficient to excite the formation of barotropic dipoles, and

the presence of the lateral boundary can make these dipoles to detach from the jet, e.g.

they not necessarily keep associated to the current main axis all the time. In the next

chapter, we will try to address the stratification effect still ignoring the presence and

interaction with the IWBC.



Chapter 5

The primitive equations numerical

model

This chapter aims to investigate the BC dipoles dynamics in a more complex frame-

work in terms of dynamical simplification. Here we added to a primitive numerical

model the technique know as Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS).

The idea is to create the initial conditions of the numerical model through the con-

struction of parametric features that were done based on previous observations of

the study area. Therefore, our parametric feature consisted of a jet along the western

boundary which presented the same kinematic characteristics of the BC. Therefore, we

implemented the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) in an idealized scenario,

where there is only a BC-like jet (potentially barotropically unstable) flowing along the

Brazilian coast. Here, the more complex oceanic scenario is composed by real topogra-

phy and a density field background (necessary for the ROMS initial conditions). The

FORMS methodology and its implementation in ROMS will be presented in the next

section.

5.1 Methodology

According to Gangopadhyay &amp;amp; Robinson [2002], each oceanic region, however unique in

their individual behavior, consists of a number of generic or common characteristic syn-

optic circulation structures. These synoptic entities or features, when put together in

108



CHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 109

a particular region, interact and evolve to generate the combined circulation variabil-

ity due to different regional set-up of multi-scale processes, bathymetry, boundaries

and forcing due to winds and buoyancy. This approach, called feature-oriented re-

gional modeling system (FORMS) [Gangopadhyay &amp;amp; Robinson, 2002], consists of empiri-

cally/analytically creating initial and/or boundary conditions for momentum/tracers

for primitive equation model simulations. The technique is widely used for atmo-

spheric and ocean nowcasting and forecasting [Robinson et al., 1988, 1989; Spall &amp;amp; Robin-

son, 1990; Fox et al., 1992; Hurlburt et al., 1992; Cummings et al., 1997; Gangopadhyay et al.,

1997; Robinson &amp;amp; Glen, 1999; Gangopadhyay et al., 2003; Calado et al., 2008, 2010], but it is

also applicable for feature-oriented process studies, as we aim here.

According to the methodology developed by Gangopadhyay &amp;amp; Robinson [2002], when

the typical characteristics of the features from previous observations or studies are

known, we can parameterize them and use as input for different process studies nu-

merical experiments and study their dynamical processes. The empirical-analytical

design formulation of the three-dimensional velocity and water mass structures of a

feature is called the feature model (FM).

We use this technique to analytically create the time-averaged smooth BC flow off

southeast Brazilian coast. We ignored the presence of IWBC (as we did in Chapters 3

and 4) since we still don’t want to incorporate the effect of a strong vertical shear in the

system, although some shear does exists along the BC flow. Then our FM is represented

by a BC-like jet, which is required to meet observation-based kinematic characteristics

(obtained in Chapter 2) and mass conservation criteria. This field is then interpolated

to a numerical model grid with the best available bathymetry, and allowed to evolve

for one year. This period is typically a minimum time spawn to see the development

of mesoscale variability. The 3D field construction will be detailed in the next section.

5.1.1 Formulation of the idealized system

Velocity FMs can be designed through two main approaches [Lozano et al., 1996]: for-

ward approach and backward approach. The forward approach consists of parame-

terizing the shape of T and S surfaces that composes the baroclinic pressure gradients

that are in geostrophic balance with the velocity structures of interest. In this case, the



CHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 110

associated velocity field may be computed by the primitive equation model or before-

hand. In the backward approach, the exact aimed velocity structure is parameterized

and the tracers are computed afterwards through a variety of methods [Gangopadhyay

&amp;amp; Robinson, 2002]. In this work, both velocity and tracers are considered as the initial

field to the primitive equation ocean model. Generally, the choice of either approach is

based on the available source of observations. Availability of direct velocity measure-

ments favors the backward approach; and availability of tracers observations favors

the forward approach. The velocity-based backward approach is also more suitable

for current or front-dominated regions. In the present process-study work, the back-

ward approach is employed.

In stage 1 of the FM backward approach, a quasi-meridional jet (which represents

the BC flow) is parameterized. Since we are using real topography data (ETOPO1 data

base), the jet along the western boundary is not fully meridionally-oriented. In stage

2, geostrophically balanced potential temperature (T ) and salinity (S) fields are com-

puted from the FM 3D velocity field. The last stage consists in computing the remain-

ing prognostic variables required by the numerical model as initial conditions, which

are the depth-averaged velocity field and the sea surface height (SSH). The application

of each one of these stages is detailed in the following paragraphs.

Starting with stage 1, the orientation of the system defined within the study area is

a natural coordinate frame of reference, where x is the cross-stream axis, y is the along

stream axis and z is the vertical axis. The y axis is roughly parallel to the isobath of

200 m, which represents the interface between the coastal and the deep oceans. For the

BC-like jet construction, we considered the jet core always at surface. Now we aim to

model a jet that is surface-intensified and keeps the same transport at the inflow and

outflow regions. So, BC horizontal cross-jet structure is parametrized by Equation 5.1

as

vh = vc sech
2

(
x?xc
?

)
, (5.1)

which describes the same Bickley jet used in Chapter 4, with a constant amplitude

defined by vc. For the cross-stream structure, a constant width proportional to ? is



CHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 111

adopted, and xc defines the position where the jet core occurs. This position xc is also

considered constant to keep the system at a fixed distance from the shelf break, roughly

following the local topography. Hereinafter, the subscript c refers to core, which is

where the maximum velocity of the jet occurs at a given y location.

For the BC vertical structure, we incorporate the variation in z through a Gaussian

variation as

vz = vc exp

[
?

(z ?zc)2

2?2b

]
, at z &amp;lt;0. (5.2)

where the parameter ?b refers to the vertical length of the Gaussian decay, proportional

to the jet vertical extension.

The graphical representation of all the relevant FM parameters are presented in by

Figure 5.1. The choice of the parameters was based in the observational data presented

in Chapter 2, so realistic jet positions, width, thickness, maximum velocities and trans-

ports were aimed. The current transport was computed analytically by integrating

Equation 5.1 from ?? to ?, which results in the simple expression

T = vc ?(?t + ?b). (5.3)

Stage 2 consists in computing T and S fields by inverting the thermal wind relation

and using a linearized version of the equation of state, as in Schmidt et al. [2007] and

Fernandes [2007]. We use local climatological T , S and potential density (?) regional av-

eraged vertical profiles to keep water masses and stratification within a realistic range.

The first step to obtain T and S is to compute ?, from the thermal wind equation

where f is the Coriolis parameter, v is interpreted as the along-shelf velocity and ?? is

where ?(0,z) is a mean density profile (also obtained from climatology) at the initial

location of the transect and L is the length of the transect. Figure 5.2 show the resulting

?? fields computed from Figure 5.1 velocity fields. Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show how the

resulting system sets horizontally, after computing all the transects in the study area

domain. Therefore, the adopted parameters for the velocity-based BC FM system were:

xc = 160 km, ? = 36 km, zc = 0 m, ?b/2 = 300 m and vc = 70 cm s?1. The resulting transport

was T = 5 Sv.

The T ? S fields, which are actually required for the primitive equation model as

initial and boundary conditions, are computed through

?(x,z) = ??[1 + ??S0(z) ? ??T (x,z)], (5.6)

which is a bi-dimensional linearized equation of state used by Fernandes [2007]. Mean

haline contraction coefficient is represented by ?? (8.0 × 10?4), ?? is the mean thermal

expansion coefficient (2.2 × 10?4 ?C?1) and S0 is a mean S profile computed from cli-

matology. Temperature is then computed by re-arranging Equation 5.6 as

T(x,z) =

??
??

+ 1 + ??S0(z)

??
, (5.7)

and salinity is obtained following Fernandes [2007] by Equation 5.8,

S(x,z) = S0(z) ? 10?2T(x,z). (5.8)

Finally, in stage 3, to complete the prognostic variables required by the numeri-

cal model, depth-averaged flow and SSH are computed. In that case, SSH is simply

computed through

SSH =

g
, (5.9)

where the geopotential anomaly (??) is obtained through S and T using 1200 m as

level of no motion.

5.1.2 Model implementation

The primitive equation model chosen for this study is the Regional Ocean Modeling

System (ROMS) [Shchepetkin &amp;amp; McWillians, 2005]. ROMS has curvilinear horizontal

coordinate system and terrain-following in the vertical. The model domain for our

area has a 1/24? resolution with 220 x 210 grid points, comprising the area 14?S to 35?S

and 54?W to 32?W, as in Figure 5.5. The total number of vertical levels is 20. For the

topography configuration, ETOPO1 is truncated in 1500 m and than interpolated to

the grid, minimizing pressure gradient errors by restricting the bathymetry gradients

under an r-factor of 0.2 [Haidvogel et al., 2000]. Additionally, the inflow and outflow

regions were configured to have a meridionally rectilinear orientation, and only the

area comprised by 22?S to 29?S kept the real topographic variation (Figure 5.5). In

this sense, we intended to configure an steady-state inflowing jet and introduce the

topographic perturbation only in the region of interest, which was Cape Frio and Cape

Sa?o Tome? areas, similarly to the approach used in Chapter 4.

Model Topography

and the dashed line is the smoothed shallow- deep ocean interface that serves as origin for the
FM transects. Note the idealized meridionally rectilinear continental margin in the inflow and
outflow regions.



CHAPTER 5. THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS NUMERICAL MODEL 116

Vertical mixing of momentum and tracers is done by the k-profile turbulent closure

model by Large et al. [1994]. Harmonic horizontal mixing and diffusivity are used both

with 5 m2s?1 coefficients in the interior of the domain and a mild sponge layer of six

grid points is applied at the open boundaries (N, S, E), linearly increasing the viscosity

up to 50 m2s?1. At the three open boundaries, we follow Peliz et al. [2003] approach by

keeping the FM fields nearly steady through the use of strong relaxation in a layer of six

grid points. Nudging time scales vary from 6 to 1 day from the interior to the boundary.

In order to avoid reflections of the flow, additional active/passive conditions were also

used at the boundaries [Marchesiello et al., 2001], with strong inflow time scale of 1 day.

In the experiment, the FM field is interpolated to ROMS grid with its bathymetry

setup. No other forcing are imposed, so all the dynamics are consequence of one year

evolution of the initial field interacting with itself and the topography.

5.2 Results

Before we start the description of our ROMS experiment results, we would like to

highlight some characteristics of the initial jet, and compare them with the parameters

we used for the jets in Chapter 4. The jet core position here was more offshore. In

the QG experiments, the higher value of this parameter was xc = 100 km. Here, we

used xc = 160 km for a more appropriate fit of the jet with the real topography. We

have to remember that the real topography presents a slope region. Therefore, the

higher value allowed that the prescribed jet could be configured to have the vertical

extension with no interference from the shallower regions of the slope. Moreover, the

parameter ?, which defines the jet width, was the same as the QG experiments (? =

36 km), which corresponds to the value of the Rossby deformation radius Rd in the

region. The parameters that define the vertical structure of the jet were not necessary

in the QG experiments, since we were using the approximation of homogeneous ocean

there.

Figure 5.6 illustrates the velocity vertical section at the inflow region (20 ?S) corre-

spondent to the first day of run. One can see the jet nicely adjusted to the topographic

configuration, where the coastal border is close to the continental shelf break. The core

is centered in approximately 39.7?W and has a velocity of about -0.45 m s?1. The jet

horizontal extension is about 110 km, while the vertical extension is 700 m of depth.

In order to assure the initial jet is potentially barotropically unstable, we tested the

Rayleigh and Fjørtoft conditions (discussed in Chapter 2). To do so, firstly we obtained

the velocity cross-jet profile correspondent to Figure 5.6 at the surface (z = 0). Such pro-

file is illustrated in Figure 5.7 (upper panel). The PV profile is illustrated in 5.7 (lower

panel). The Rayleigh and Fjørtoft profiles obtained from the velocity profile are both

represented in Figure 5.8 (upper and lower panels respectively).

The results obtained in the ROMS experiment are shown in Figures 5.9 and 5.10,

where we chose a sequence of 12 snapshots representative of 31 days of run. In the

plots, we are showing only the area we are focusing in (which comprises the region

of real topographic variation). The idealized inflow and outflow regions are partially

showed with the intention of giving a better visualization of the inflowing jet.

During the 31 days period, we could see the jet interacting with the changes in to-

pography. The BC jet is initially following the continental margin and we start to see

meandering by day 9. In days 12 to 15, around the parallel of 23?S, the jet seems to

tend to form a cyclonic eddy or meander in its coastal side and an anticyclonic eddy

is formed in its oceanic side. This apparently indicates the tendency of dipole genera-

tion. This instability seems to have had origin due to the change in the 200 m isobath

profile, represented by Cape Frio indentation. At the same time, we can see the mean-

ders intensifying in the downstream region of the area (around 27?S). After day 17, the

bipolar feature in Cape Frio developed, started presenting growth and intensified. The

process can be seen in days 17 to 31. During this period, the jet started presenting some

instabilities right off Cape Sa?o Tome? (parallel of 22?S), and it started forming an anti-

cyclonic eddy. This eddy also presented growth and extended meridionally, forcing

the jet upstream. By day 27, the Cape Sa?o Tome? anticyclone and Cape Frio dipole are

formed and established, and two anticyclonic eddies appeared downstream, centered

in 27?S and 29?S. The Cape Frio vortex-dipole presented a weak propagation down-

stream, where the anticyclonic side developed more and presented higher dimensions

than the cyclonic one. The horizontal dimensions of the final features were about 200

km.

In order to have more insight in the formation of the bipolar structure we specu-

lated in the previous paragraph, we looked to the vertical velocity section in day 30,

where we obtained a zonal slice of the field centered in 24?S. Figure 5.11 illustrates

such vertical section. It is possible to see the BC current (represented by the negative

velocity values) associated with positive velocities in both sides of its flow. The jet core

shifted offshore, and now it is centered in 42?W. This indicates the jet had some sep-

aration from the coast probably due to the change in coastline orientation. Moreover,

this configuration seem to be favorable to the formation of a yet incipient dipole.

5.3 Summary and Discussion

In the present chapter our intention was to add more dynamical complexity to our

physical system through the implementation of a primitive equation numerical model,

where we used ROMS. As we did in Chapter 4, we prescribed a BC-like jet using the

technique known as Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS). The jet

was potentially barotropically unstable due to horizontal shear, and a weak vertical

shear had to be included in order to reproduce a realistic BC. Two important character-

istics were introduced here: real topography and stratification effect. Here, the ocean

is continuously stratified, and, although only one jet was prescribed along the domain

(we ignored the IWBC jet), a weak vertical shear is present, which means baroclinic

instability may occur concomitantly with barotropic instability. The real topography

not only incorporates changes in coastline orientation, but also includes the slope.

Within the set of parameters relevant to the BC characteristics and applied here, it is

clear the jet showed perturbations located where there is changes in coastline orienta-

tion. It seems we obtained the formation of a bipolar feature right off Cape Frio, since

the feature was depicted in the vertical velocity section of Figure 5.11. Such structure

presented (in day 31) about 200 km of diameter and had the same length scale and

position obtained by Pereira [2009]. Figure 5.12 illustrated a zoom of the right lower

panel of Figure 5.10, so the reader can have a better looking into the feature scales.

Downstream of the dipole, a wave-like pattern is present and some anticyclones

were formed. This scenario resembles the one obtained by Campos et al. [1996] and

depicted in our simulation of Chapter 3, e.g. the formation of a dipole upstream and a

sequence of eddies downstream. Here we cannot say we obtained a sequence of several

eddies, but we speculate this results could evolve to a similar scenario afterwards.

Trying to have some insights of the dynamics of our simulation, we used the QG

framework and evaluated the BC-like flow in terms of this approximation. Firstly, we

computed the Rossby number according to Equation ??, where

Ro =

(
?v
?x
? ?u

?y

)
|f0|

, (5.10)

for the BC jet at the inflow. We obtained Ro = 0.2, which indicates the system can be

explained by the QG approximation. Going further in our dynamical analyses, we

followed once again Magaldi et al. [2008], as we did in Chapter 4. So we evaluated

the coastline curvature and compared with the jet deformation radius, according to

Equation 4.8, and obtained Bu = 8.20. This calculation was conducted for the initial jet.

As discussed by Magaldi et al. [2008], they obtained a pattern, where for low Bu, e.g.,

Bu &amp;lt;0.1 (weak stratification), a fully attached regime is established, and the jet flows

smoothly over the cape. For intermediate Bu, e.g., 0.1 &amp;lt;Bu &amp;lt;1, fluid parcels flow

more around the obstacle than over it. Flow separation occurs and small tip eddies

start to shed. The increasing of Bu shifts the system from a eddy-attached regime

(where eddies are formed behind the cape and shed downstream) to a lee eddy regime

(where small lee eddies are formed and grow behind the cape). For high Bu, e.g.,

Bu &gt; 1, (strong stratification), tip eddies merge to form larger eddies in the lee of

the cape. In our results, we could see indeed the formation of tip eddies in coastline

inflexion points, which is in accordance with the pattern obtained by the above authors,

although we used a different coastline shape. The computed Bu indicates, according

to the authors, we have a strong stratification system. We know that both rotation and

stratification are actually important in Cape Frio region. However, we must have in

mind we are using an idealized system here, where we do not have the presence of the

IWBC. Nevertheless, we could not see the evaluation of the structures after 31 days,

and how the propagation would be given.

We cited, in Chapter 4, the study of Stern &amp;amp; Whitehead [1990], where they evaluated

the role of variations in coastline curvature in the behavior of a jet passing around an

indentation similar to Cape Frio scenario. According to the pattern obtained by the

authors, an abrupt angle would favor separation of the jet from the boundary, and a

mushroom-like structure would form and set the path for the trailing jet. In the other

hand, a smoother angle (they discussed the critical angle) would favor an attached jet

that eventually would form eddies. The scenario obtained here resembles this second

regime obtained by these authors, since we could not see separation in any moment.

Finally, it is important to highlight that our goals number 5 presented in Section

1.2 were accomplished in the present chapter, e.g we examined the interaction of a

barotropically unstable meridional jet and the western boundary in a realistic topogra-

phy scenario. We saw the formation of features that seemed to be triggered by lateral

boundary perturbations (or variations). A bipolar feature was incipiently formed off

Cape Frio indentation. However, due to the short-run conducted here, and could not

see propagation and possible detachment of these structures and their interaction with

the current.



Chapter 6

Conclusions

In this final chapter we present a brief overview of the study conducted here, compare

important points obtained from each model results, point out unresolved important

issues and suggest future work.

In summary, we presented observational evidences of the formation of vortex dipole

structures along the Brazilian continental margin south of Cape Frio (23?S). Informa-

tion from the literature and a mere inspection of series of AVHRR images revealed the

formation of paired eddies with opposite vorticity signs in each side of the BC nearby

the Cape. Downstream, a staggered series of smaller cyclones and anticyclones were

found forming what was called a vortex street by Pratt et al. [1991]. Additionally, the

images also depicted different phenomena not yet reported for the BC: typical instabil-

ity wave trains within Santos Bight (23?S-28?S). These trains seem to be very similar to

those described for the Gulf Stream by Xue &amp;amp; Mellor [1993], upstream of the Charleston

Bump.

The kernel of this dissertation is, then, to unravel the dynamics of the vortex dipole

and vortex street formation phenomena. In order to address the issue, we stated two

working hypotheses: (1) barotropic instability is the driving mechanism for the for-

mation of dipoles and instability wave trains, and (2) changes in coastline orientation

can promote perturbations in the BC jet which trigger those instabilities. We tested the

two hypotheses through the formulation, implementation and application of a suite of

three idealized models. We progressively added dynamical complexity to first isolate

the instability mechanism and, later in document, to explore the role of lateral bound-

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 128

ary changes in the flow. The first of these models dealt with an idealized southward-

flowing, barotropically unstable jet in a QG contour dynamics model (Chapter 3); the

second model consisted of exploring a continuous potential vorticity QG full numerical

model of a jet flowing adjacent to western boundary that could be either meridional

or curvy (Chapter 4). The first two models employed an equivalent-barotropic and

barotropic vertical structure, respectively. The third model employed consisted of a

primitive equation numerical model (Chapter 5), through which we relaxed the layer

approximation constraint of the former two, as well as the QG approximation. We

performed simulations allowing the examination of a realistically shaped baroclinic jet

flowing over a realistic continental margin.

In Chapter 3, we formulated a piecewise-constant PV, contour dynamics model that

resembled both Pratt et al. [1991] and Schmidt [2004], but considered three contours (or

three PV fronts) and the presence of the western boundary. The choice of the three

fronts is due to the fact that such configuration is the minimal PV structure to support

a vortex dipole structure to be formed in each side of the boundary jet. We also did

not opt for a convention span of the CD model parameter. Instead, we attempted to

do a match using one of the few scarce observations of the BC jet not meandering,

and hence, assumed to be possibly closer to a (yet unknown) steady state. In the ex-

periments conducted, we could reproduce the formation of paired eddies upstream

(dipole) and a sequence of opposing-sign eddies downstream, which already resem-

bled the observational evidences presented in Chapter 1. Therefore, we verified that

barotropic instability can indeed generate bipolar vortical features in jets with a PV

configuration similar to that of the Brazil Current.

In Chapter 4, we relaxed the piecewise constant PV field constraint of the CD

method, and advanced the methodology regarding the PV field characteristics. The

experiments employing a barotropic jet possessing a continuous PV structure pro-

duced richer dynamics occurring in the model domain. We could observe not only

that barotropic instability can generate bipolar structures, but also that the change in

the coastline orientation can indeed trigger perturbations in the boundary current. By

changing the PV structure of the jet as well as the coastline configuration we were not

only able to simulate the dipole/vortex street formation but also the instability wave



CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 129

trains.

In Chapter 5, we implemented the ROMS model using feature models [Gangopad-

hyay et al., 2003] as initial conditions. However, the feature models employed in our

study were built to resemble the linear instability properties of the jets from Chapter 3.

We used real topography of the study area and, therefore, added more dynamical com-

plexity to our physical system. Again, we could see that both barotropic instability and

topographic variations can induce the formation of bipolar structures. Even this more

complex scenario kept the pattern of the two previous chapters regarding formation of

structures. The dipole formed satisfactorily reproduced the velocity structure obtained

by Pereira [2009] for the DEPROAS V cruise. Hence, our hypotheses were affirmatively

verified for the present work.

Theory involving dynamics of current separation may be related to the scenario of

a curvy coastline studied here. For instance, Marshall &amp;amp; Tansley [2001], Castelao &amp;amp; Barth

[2006], Stern &amp;amp; Whitehead [1990] tried to find parameter that could limit regimes of flow

separation and flow attachment. Doglioli et al. [2004] mentioned that eddy generation

is connected to the ubiquitous phenomenon of current separation occurring in flows in

presence of obstacles. However, as a general consensus, Cessi &amp;amp; Ierley [1993] mentioned

that viscous shear instability is proposed as a primary mechanism for generating time-

dependent eddies at western boundary. Because of the complex nonlinear nature of the

phenomenon, a quantitative prediction of eddy characteristics as a function of environ-

mental parameters is hard to achieve. Many different mechanisms, characterized by

different non-dimensional parameters, play an important role, including bottom fric-

tion processes, vertical and horizontal mixing, and stratification [Doglioli et al., 2004].

In this sense, Flierl [1999] showed that baroclinic processes play a significant role in the

growth of meanders, while upper-layer interactions drive the final pinch-off of eddies.

Here we isolated the effect of the horizontal velocity shear, and consequently PV

structure, to address the role of barotropic instability being the driving mechanism

for the vortex dipole formation, as well as the vortex street and the instability wave

trains. The topographic changes provide sites for perturbing the jet and letting the

phenomena to develop. Certainly, other factors (such as the mentioned above) may

play important role in the formation of eddies and dipoles, and may determine differ-



CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 130

ent regimes.

As future work, we suggest the inclusion of the vertical shear effect in order to see

the response of the jet regarding dipole formation and its downstream evolution. To

complement our study, it would be important to evaluate other dynamical aspects of

the results, such as trying to fit solutions for the results obtained (Rossby wave solu-

tions, pulse-train solutions and so on). Particularly, using topographic Rossby wave

forcing would be interesting to compare to the processes of warm outbreaks in the GS.

The inclusion of the ? effect should give important changes in the results. Moreover,

simulations of the interaction of the jet with a cyclone could give important dynami-

cal insights regarding the BC interacting with the Cape Frio eddies. And simulations

of the interaction of the jet with an anticyclone could be carried assuming the anti-

cyclones of Agulhas rings reach the western boundary of the South Atlantic and also

interact with the BC.
