resumo 
 

 

O estudo de acumulações de gás offshore tem sido um tópico chave ao longo 
das últimas décadas, devido à importância da produção e exploração de 
hidrocarbonetos. A presença de gás livre ou acumulações de gás nos 
sedimentos pode indicar a presença de reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos em 
profundidade. Este trabalho apresenta os resultados de uma campanha 
geofísica realizada na margem continental Oeste da Galiza, no âmbito de um 
projecto de investigação para estudar um pockmark gigante descoberto nesta 
margem, conhecido como Gran Burato. Os principais objectivos deste trabalho 
foram o re-processamento e interpretação dos dados sísmicos multicanal, 
adquiridos na campanha BURATO4240. O processamento sísmico preliminar 
realizado durante a campanha de aquisição foi melhorado no âmbito deste 
trabalho, com um fluxo de processamento mais pormenorizado (análise de 
velocidades detalhada e migração pré-stack em tempo dos perfis mais 
representativos), de modo a permitir uma melhor visualização da parte mais 
profunda dos perfis sísmicos. A aplicação de técnicas de processamento 
utilizadas na indústria melhorou a qualidade do processamento preliminar, em 
particular, a resolução das falhas e as partes mais profundas das secções 
sísmicas, o que foi essencial para a interpretação sísmica. No âmbito desta 
tese, a interpretação sísmica preliminar foi detalhada e melhorada, as falhas 
principais foram espacialmente correlacionadas, e mapas estruturais e dos 
horizontes interpretados foram criados em tempo e em profundidade. Foi 
construído um mapa estrutural preliminar para a área de estudo, o que permite 
um conhecimento integrado sobre possíveis mecanismos de formação do Gran 
Burato, e também sobre a estrutura geológica observada nesta região. A 
origem do Gran Burato parece estar relacionada com vários episódios de 
expulsão massiva de gás que remobilizaram os sedimentos, dando origem a 
esta impressionante estrutura. Este gás terá provavelmente migrado através 
de falhas para as unidades sedimentares mais superficiais, onde foi 
acumulado. Uma interpretação preliminar de possíveis evidências de escape e 
acumulações de fluidos (provavelmente gás) foi realizada, e várias anomalias 
de amplitudes foram identificadas. As fracas evidências de gás na zona do 
Gran Burato, aparentam suportar a ideia de que a maioria do gás nesta zona já 
terá escapado, provavelmente durante a formação desta estrutura. Contudo, 
possíveis evidências de gás foram detectadas em áreas vizinhas.

abstract 

 
The study of offshore gas accumulation has been a key-topic over the last 
decades due to the importance of hydrocarbon exploration and production. The 
presence of free gas or gas accumulations in the sediments can also indicate 
hydrocarbon reservoirs in depth. This work presents the results of a 
geophysical survey in the Western continental Galicia margin in the scope of a 
research project to investigate a giant pockmark discovered in this margin, 
known as the Gran Burato. The main objectives of this work were the detailed 
re-processing and interpretation of the multichannel seismic data acquired 
during the BURATO4240 survey. The preliminary processing carried out 
onboard during the cruise was improved in the scope of this work, with a more 
detailed processing (detailed velocity analysis and pre-stack time migration of 
selected seismic lines), to better image the deeper part of the seismic sections. 
The application of advanced processing techniques allowed the improvement 
of the onboard seismic processing, in particular, the imaging of the faults and 
the deeper part of the seismic sections, which helped the seismic interpretation 
work. In this thesis, the preliminary seismic interpretation was revised, 
improved, the main faults were mapped, and time and depth structural and 
horizon maps for the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units were 
produced. A preliminary structural map of the study area was obtained, which 
contributes to a better knowledge about the possible formation of the Gran 
Burato, and the underlying geology. The origin of the Gran Burato seems to be 
related to episodes of massive expulsions of gas which lifted the overlying 
sediments into the water, which then were drifted away by the currents, and 
created this outstanding structure. This gas probably migrated to the upper 
stratigraphic sequences through the extensive faults, where it was 
accumulated. A preliminary interpretation of possible evidences of fluids (most 
likely gas) accumulations and leakage were performed, and several amplitudes 
anomalies were identified. The weaker evidences of gas or other fluids around 
the Gran Burato seem to support the idea that the majority of the gas has 
already escaped, probably during the formation of this giant pockmark. 
However, possible evidences of gas accumulations were identified in areas 
farther away. New multichannel seismic data acquired last August in the same 
area, will permit to confirm better some hypothesis rose in this work, and will 
certainly represent a solid base to support this investigation work.

Chapter I. Introduction 
 

 

I. 1 Nature and scope of this work 

This thesis corresponds to the Final Project of the MSc Course on Geological 

Engineering, branch of Geological Resources, from the Geosciences Department of the 

University of Aveiro, Portugal. This research work was carried out under the supervision of 

Prof. Luis Menezes Pinheiro, from the University of Aveiro, with the support of the GRAN 

BURATO-2010 project. This project was funded by the University of Vigo, in the scope of 

the Spanish research project “Proyecto da morfoestructura singular da marxe continental 

occidental da Galicia coñecida como O Gran Burato”, coordinated by Prof Daniel Rey 

Garcia from the University of Vigo, Spain. That project is part of a contract between the 

Dirección Xeral de Industria (Xunta de Galicia) and the University of Vigo, for the 

investigation of a large pockmark structure discovered in the Western Galicia continental 

margin, known as Gran Burato, and was carried out with the participation of the 

Universities of Aveiro (Portugal) and Granada (Spain). 

The processing and interpretation of the seismic data presented in this work was carried 

out at the Marine Geology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of 

the University of Aveiro. 

In the scope of this thesis, the author had the opportunity to participate in two scientific 

surveys (BURATO4240 - October 2010; GRAN BURATO 2011 - August 2011) as a 

member of the geophysical team responsible for the onboard seismic data processing. 

The participation in several seismic processing data courses, in particular a two-week stay 

in the United States with Dr. Dan Herold and Dr. Matthew Ralston, from Paralell 

Geoscience Corporation, allowed the learning and application of advanced seismic data 

processing techniques, and were clearly an important and essential support for this thesis. 

 

I. 2 Objectives 

The main objectives of the present work were the detailed re-processing and the 

interpretation of the multichannel seismic data acquired during the BURATO4240 

scientific survey.

During the acquisition cruise (Rey et al., in prep.) a preliminary onboard processing of the 

seismic profiles was performed by the geophysical team headed by L. M. Pinheiro 

(University of Aveiro), which included M. J. Román-Alpiste (University of Granada), H. 

Duarte (LNEG – National Laboratory of Energy and Geology), L. Azevedo (University of 

Aveiro/ IST – Technical Superior Institute) and the author of this work (University of 

Aveiro). The first main objective of this thesis was to improve the preliminary onboard data 

processing with a more detailed processing, to better image the deeper part of the seismic 

sections. The new processing flow includes a detailed velocity analysis and the pre-stack 

time migration of selected seismic lines. 

The second main objective of this thesis was to carry out the interpretation of the 

processed seismic data. A preliminary seismic interpretation of the main seismic units and 

faults was first performed at the University of Aveiro, for the preparation of the cruise 

report (Pinheiro et al., 2010), with the collaboration of the author, and of Omar 

Bennazzouz, an MSc student from the University of Tanger, Morroco. This preliminary 

interpretation was used as a basis for this work. In this thesis the preliminary interpretation 

was revised, improved, the main faults were mapped, and time and depth structural and 

horizon maps for the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units were produced. 

 

I. 3 Location of the Study Area 

The study area is located in the Western Galicia continental margin (Spain). It is bounded 

by the parallels 42ºN and 43ºN and by the meridians 10ºW and 12ºW (Figure I.1). The 

water depth in this region ranges between 1000m and 3000m.  

The Western Galicia continental margin is a non-volcanic passive rifted margin (Montadert 

et al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979; Boillot et al., 1995; Pérez-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001) 

that was reactivated in the Cenozoic due to the Africa-Eurasian convergence (e.g. 

Masson and Parson, 1983; Murillas et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Masson et al., 1994; 

Boillot et al., 1995; Whitmarsh et al., 1998). It extends from Cape Finisterre (~43ºN), in the 

North, to about ~40ºN, in the South  

The studied structure – the Gran Burato - is a fairly large slightly-elliptic topographic 

depression (see Figure I.3), with a maximum diameter of 4km and a depth of about 130m. 

It is located at approximately 42º40’N and 11º04’W, and at a water depth of 1650m. It has 

been interpreted as a giant pockmark and its formation is currently interpreted as 

associated with a significant event of gas seepage.

I. 4 The BURATO4240 Survey 

The BURATO4240 scientific survey was carried out approximately 150km off W Galicia, 

Spain, onboard of the R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa (Figure I.2) between the 16
th
 of October 

and the 3
rd
 of November 2010. 

The main purpose of this survey was to investigate an area with several large topographic 

depressions reported East of the Galicia Bank area (Vázquez et al., 2009; Ercilla et al., 

2011). The main aim of this research cruise was to investigate in detail these depressions, 

in particular one very large structure, known as the Gran Burato, also known as Burato 

ERGAP (Vázquez et al., 2009). The BURATO4240 survey consisted of two cruise LEGs: 

LEG-1 (16
th
 to the 26

th
 of October, 2010) focused on the geophysical data acquisition, in 

particular of multichannel seismic reflection profiles and multibeam bathymetry; LEG-2 

(27
th
 October to the 3

rd
 November, 2010) concentrated on sampling of seabottom

sediments and benthic organisms with coring and beam trawls, respectively. The scientific 

team consisted of scientific researchers and post-graduate students from the University of 

Vigo (Spain), the University of Aveiro (Portugal) and the University of Granada (Spain). 

 

The R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa 

The Oceanographic Research Vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa (Figure I. 2 a,b), launched in 

2006, is a research vessel designed and constructed to work on multidisciplinary marine 

research topics. This vessel belongs to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) 

and is operated by the Marine Technology Unit (UTM), which is responsible for 

maintaining and operating the scientific equipment and providing the technical support 

staff required to carry out the ocean research missions. She can accommodate up to a 

maximum of 25 scientists. It has two crews, and can operate about 330 days per year. 

 

LEG-1: Geophysical Data Acquisition 

During LEG-1, a set of 34 multichannel seismic reflection lines (Figure I.3) were acquired 

together with multibeam bathymetry. The multichannel seismic data (MCS) data were 

acquired with a seismic source composed of an array of 10 airguns (1840cu in), and a 

2km long hydrophone streamer as the receiver array (Figure I. 2 c,d,e,f). The airguns 

used were GGUN-II from Sercel, calibrated with a pressure of 2000 psi, and towed at 7m 

water depth, shooting every 50m. The streamer was a SAS Sentinel from Sercel with a 

total length of 2243m, 156 channels (8 hydrophones per channel), and a spacing between 

channels of 12.5m. The recording length was 10 seconds (TWT) at 1 or 2ms sampling 

interval. The streamer was towed at 7.5m water depth, and in order to maintain it stable, 

“birds” were installed along the streamer approximately every 300m (Figure I. 2 e). The 

preliminary processing of the MCS data was fully carried out onboard by the geophysical 

team. 

More detailed information concerning the acquisition parameters and the multichannel 

seismic geometry acquisition are presented in the Chapter IV. 

During LEG-1, multibeam bathymetry was also acquired simultaneously with the seismic 

data. For this purpose a multibeam system ATLAS® Hydrosweep DS, with a frequency of 

15.5 kHz, capable of operating between depths of 10m to 11000m, was used. The vertical 

resolution of this system is ~15cm, with a precision of 0.5cm, or 0.2% of water depth.

I. 5 Dataset  

The dataset used for this work consisted of 34 multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) 

profiles acquired in the Gran Burato area, on the West continental Galicia margin, during 

the BURATO4240 - LEG-1 research cruise (Figure I. 2; Figure I.3). The seismic lines form 

a fairly dense grid of seismic lines, spaced about 500m in the East/West direction and 

1000m in the North/South direction, covering a total area of approximately 1000km 

(Figure I.3).

I. 6 Methodology 

In order to accomplish the main objectives, two different methodologies were adopted: 

one for the seismic data processing, and the other for the seismic data interpretation. 

 

Seismic Data Processing 

The processing of the seismic profiles was performed with two different seismic 

processing software packages: 

(1) ProMAX (Seismic Data Processing Software) from Landmark – Halliburton. 

This software was used to perform the preliminary onboard seismic processing 

during the acquisition cruise, and also, in the scope of this work, by the author, 

using one ProMAX license from LNEG. The adopted onboard seismic 

processing consisted of 5 main processing flows: Geometry Assignment; 

Frequency Filter; Velocity Analysis; Stack; and Post-Stack Time Migration. 

After a few tests, it was decided not to perform a deconvolution, in order to 



Chapter I. Introduction 

 

7 
 

preserve the maximum seismic signal possible, at this preliminary processing 

stage. 

(2) Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW), from Parallel Geoscience Corporation. 

This software was used to improve the seismic processing of the most 

representative seismic profiles, including pre-stack time migration of the most 

significant profiles. The main processing steps consisted of: Geometry 

Assignment; Frequency Filter; Velocity Analysis; Deconvolution; CMP sort; Radon 

Demultiple; Dip Moveout/Pre-Stack time migration; Post-Stack time migration and 

Bandwidth Extension. 

 

Seismic Interpretation 

The seismic interpretation was carried out using the Kingdom Suite seismic interpretation 

package, thanks to a software donation to the University of Aveiro by Seismic Micro-

Technology, to whom we thank, and whose support was crucial for this work. The 

preliminary interpretation was checked, refined and the deeper seismic stratigraphic units 

were interpreted following classification of Murillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al. (2008). 

This interpretation was then correlated to all the seismic profiles and verified at seismic 

lines intersections. Horizons maps for the main units, in time and depth, were created. 

The main faults were mapped, spatially correlated and structural maps for the study area, 

were obained. Finally, a preliminary study on the seismic expression of potential gas 

accumulation and leakage was carried out. 

 

I. 7 Structure of this thesis 

The thesis is divided into six chapters. This first chapter briefly introduces the reader to 

the nature and scope of this work, the main objectives, the location of the study area, the 

scientific survey, the dataset and the methodology used. It ends with this brief description 

of the thesis structure. 

The second chapter presents the study area, describes the geological setting and 

describes the geological structures investigated. A detailed analysis of the main seismic-

stratigraphic units identified in this area is also included. 

The third chapter starts with a briefly description of the seismic reflection method, the 

necessary equipment and the marine acquisition method. The basic general seismic data 

processing steps for 2D seismic data are also described.

Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 
 

 

II. 1 Introduction 

The Iberian Peninsula is located in the Eurasian Plate, north of the present-day 

Africa/Eurasia plate boundary (Figure II.1). Since the Oligocene, Iberia has been part of 

the Eurasian plate, with the boundary between the African and the Eurasian plates located 

at its present position along the Azores-Gibraltar fracture zone. This plate boundary 

extends eastwards from the Açores, in the West, to the Mediterranean, in the East 

(Klitgord and Schouten, 1986; Srivastava et al., 1990a; Srivastava et al., 1990b). The 

precise location of this plate boundary East of Gorringe Bank, in the vicinity of the 

Gibraltar Straight, is still a matter of debate (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Gutscher et al., 2002; 

Zitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). 

 

Figure II.1 – Detail of the North Atlantic bathymetric map in the vicinity of the study area (data from 
the GEBCO Digital Atlas) with the location of the Iberian Peninsula and the plate boundaries. The 
black line corresponds to a simplified location of the plate boundaries, after Coffin et al. (1998). 

 

Analysis of seafloor-spreading magnetic anomalies, complemented by paleomagnetic 

studies (Van der Voo and Zijderveld, 1971; Galdeano et al., 1989), suggest that the

separation between Iberia and Newfoundland occurred during the Early Cretaceous 

(Whitmarsh et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995; Pinheiro et al., 

1996). Several studies on plate tectonic reconstruction on the North American and 

European continental margins indicate that the southeastern margin of the Canadian 

Grand Banks is the conjugate of the West Iberia margin (e.g. Bullard et al., 1965; Le 

Pichon and Sibuet, 1971; Boillot and Capdevila, 1977; Olivet et al., 1984; Masson and 

Miles, 1984; Srivastava and Tapscott, 1986; Srivastava et al., 1990b; Srivastava and 

Verhoef, 1992). 

The western Iberian margin, like the conjugate Grand Banks margin, is a non-volcanic 

passive rifted margin (Montadert et al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979) since there is no 

evidence of significant syn-rift volcanism, neither onshore or offshore (Pinheiro, 1994; 

Sawyer et al., 1994;Pinheiro et al., 1996; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995). Furthermore, MCS 

reflection sections do not reveal any indication of seaward-dipping reflector sequences 

(Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Mauffret et al., 1989; Pickup et al., 1996) and modeling of 

wide-angle seismic profiles across the margin did not show the typical high-velocities 

associated with lower crustal underplated bodies characteristic of volcanic margins 

(Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, 1994; Whitmarsh et al., 1996b; Chian et al., 1999). 

Instead, evidence of serpentinization of the mantle was found (Pinheiro et al., 1992; 

Pinheiro, 1994; Sawyer et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Whitmarsh et al., 1998). 

The West Iberia margin has been the focus of several geological and geophysical 

investigations during the last few decades. Until present, this margin has been extensively 

investigated with different geophysical methods, such as magnetic, gravity, deep 

multichannel seismic profiles (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Murillas et al., 1990; 

Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro,1994; Henning et al., 2004) and wide-angle profiles 

(Whitmarsh et al., 1996b; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2003). It has been drilled in the scope of

II. 2 Formation and Structural Evolution of the Western Iberia 

Margin 

The width of the West Iberia continental shelf varies between 10-65 km along its 

approximate 700km length. As pointed out by Vanney and Mougenot (1981) and 

Mougenot (1988), this margin can be divided in three main distinct structurally domains 

(Figure II.2): the Tagus Abyssal Plain (TAP; 37º– 39ºN), the Iberia Abyssal Plain (IAP; 

39º– 41ºN) and the Deep Galicia Margin (DGM, 41º– 43ºN).  

 

Figure II.2 - Bathymetric map of the Western and Southern Iberia margin (data from GEBCO 
Digital Atlas). The margin is divided in three main segments: DGM – Deep Galicia Margin; IAP – 
Iberia Abyssal Plain; TAP – Tagus Abyssal Plain. The Galicia Interior Basin (GIB) is located 
between Galicia Bank (GB) and the continental shelf; contours every 1000m. 

 

Although still a matter of debate, the seafloor spreading in the West Iberia Margin is 

thought to have begun at anomaly M11 (~134 My) in the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Pinheiro et 

al., 1992; Pinheiro et al., 1996), during anomaly M3 (~125 My) near the ODP site 897 in

the periodotite ridge at the Iberian Abyssal Plain (Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995), and in  the 

Late Aptian, in the Deep Galicia Margin (Lower Cretaceous) (Boillot and Winterer, 1988; 

Pinheiro et al., 1996). Studies based on MCS and wide-angle seismic profiles across the 

two northern provinces suggest that, from East to West, the Ocean-Continent Transition 

(OCT) across this margin consists of: (1) thinned continental crust characterized, at least 

on its seaward edge, by rotated fault blocks with possible mafic intrusions; (2) a zone of 

exhumed continental mantle (ZECM) at the OCT, in which mantle rocks have been 

serpentinized to varying degrees and; (3) an acoustic basement with the seismic and 

magnetic signatures typical of oceanic crust, to the West (Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, 

1994; Sibuet et al., 1995; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995; Pickup et al., 1996; Whitmarsh et 

al., 1996a). 

The Iberia continental margin was developed during the northward propagation of the 

Atlantic Ocean rift system, which involved several rifting phases from the Triassic to the 

Early Cretaceous (Wilson et al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Figure 

II.3). During this northward propagation, three main rifting episodes have affected the west 

Iberia margin: (1) a late Triassic to Early Jurassic (Hettangian) rifting event; (2) a Upper 

Jurasic (late Oxfordian/early Kimmeridgian) rifting event (documented by Wilson et al., 

1989, as the first episodes of rifting, located on the Lusitanian Basin), and (3) a Early 

Cretaceous (Valanginian/Hauterivian to Aptian) rifting episode that culminated with the 

formation of oceanic crust and separation of Iberia from the Grand Banks of Canada 

(Wilson et al., 1989; Manatschal and Bernoulli, 1999; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Figure II.3) 

This rifting between Iberia and the Grand Banks proceeded intermittently during the Late 

Paleozoic and Mesozoic, culminating in the continental breakup in the Early Cretaceous 

(Rasmussen et al., 1998). Its complete separation from North America in the late Aptian 

was followed by the development of a separate Iberian micro-plate successively attached 

to Eurasia and Africa (Srivastava et al., 1990b). 

The tectonic style of the continental margin acquired during the main rifts episodes is 

essentially characterized by tilted fault blocks bounded by seaward dipping normal faults 

(Figures II.3; II.4 and II.5) which delineated a series of half-grabens (Mauffret and 

Montadert, 1987; Thommeret et al., 1988; Sibuet, 1992). These features are frequently 

observed on seismic reflection profiles (Galice, 1979; Krawczyk et al., 1996; Pickup et al., 

1996). Sibuet et al. (1987) showed that, off Galicia, these half-graben structures trend 

dominantly North-South; however, in the southern Iberia Abyssal Plain and in the Tagus 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

13 
 

Abyssal Plain the trend of the continental blocks appears to be more variable (Whitmarsh 

et al., 1990; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Pinheiro, 1994; Whitmarsh and Miles, 1995). 

 

Figure II.3 - Temporal and spacial evolution scheme of the West Iberia rifting process, showing the 
(1) inicial process of the rift, (2) the advanced rift phase, where the rift “jumps” to the west, until (3) 
the final phase of seafloor spreading (modified from Manatschal and Bernoulli, 1999; in Druet and 
Yepes, 2010).  

 

The mechanism of lithospheric extension that originated this continental breakup is also 

still a matter of debate. According to Sibuet (1992), it seems that a composite model 

involving pure-shear affecting the whole lithosphere and simple-shear affecting only the 

upper brittle crustal levels, along a low angle detachment that soles out at the 

brittle/ductile transition, can best explain the observations. A very strong seismic reflector 

imaged on the available seismic sections West of Galicia Bank – the “S-Reflector” – is a 

good candidate for such a detachment (Boillot et al., 1989, Sibuet, 1992; Reston, 1996; 

Reston et al., 1996a). Brun and Beslier (1996), however, demonstrated through analog 

modeling, that the observed conjugate margin geometry could equally have formed under 

pure shear only.

After the large extensional rift event, the West Iberia margin has suffered compressional 

episodes during the Cenozoic, due to the convergence between the African and the 

Eurasian plates. These events were responsible for the formation of the Pyrenean and 

Alpine orogenies (e.g. Masson and Parson, 1983;Murillas et al., 1990; Masson et al., 

1994;Pinheiro et al., 1996; Brun and Beslier, 1996). Along the West Iberia margin these 

compressive episodes occurred mainly during the Eocene and the Miocene (Boillot et al., 

1979; Ribeiro, 1988; Srivastava et al., 1990a; Ribeiro et al., 1990; Malod et al., 1993; 

Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996). 

The Miocene compressional episode was responsible for the formation of the Betic chain 

in southeastern Iberia (Sibuet and Le Pichon, 1971; Murillas et al., 1990), and it was the 

result of the convergence between Africa and Europe/Iberia (e.g. LeBlanc and Olivier, 

1984). Plate tectonic models for the Early Miocene predict a NW-directed compression 

(Roest and Srivastava, 1991). 

The Eocene deformation episode is essentially related to the formation of the Pyrenean-

Cantabrian Chain and to the incipient subduction developed in the southern Bay of Biscay 

(Sibuet and Le Pichon, 1971; Grimaud et al., 1982; Malod et al., 1993) which resulted 

from the convergence between Iberia and Europe (Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 

1996). Analyses of plate tectonic movements in the Bay of Biscay suggest that about 

40km of N to NW shortening took place during a episode of right-lateral strike-slip during 

the Early Tertiary (Srivastava and Tapscott, 1986; Roest and Srivastava, 1991), which is 

compatible with the history of the Pyrenees, where relative motion between Europe and 

Iberia evolved from NW to NE compression through the Early Tertiary (e.g. Guimera, 

1984; De Ruig et al., 1991).  

Strong evidence offshore of Cenozoic reactivation of late Variscan faults as reverse faults 

or transpressive strike-slip structures are observed, particularly during the Eocene and the 

Miocene (Boillot et al., 1979; Mauffret et al., 1989; Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro, 1994; 

Pinheiro et al., 1996), which appears to continue today. These fault reactivations are 

suggested by the localized presence of seafloor scarps above compressional structures 

within the ocean/continent transition, accompanied by deformation of recent sediments 

(Pinheiro, 1994; Masson et al., 1994; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Alves et al., 2003a).  

The Cenozoic deformation in the abyssal domain is predominantly characterized by a 

broad oceanward-facing monoclinal sequence that can be several tens of kilometers wide, 

and which most of the times terminates in a tight asymmetric fold, generally related with a 

steeply dipping fault or faults (Masson et al., 1994). 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

15 
 

As a result of these rifting and deformation phases, the Western Iberia margin and its 

onshore extension were differentiated into a series of uplifted blocks (e.g. Estremadura 

spur) and areas of relative subsidence (e.g. Lower Tagus Basin) (Rasmussen et al., 1998; 

Alves et al., 2003a). 

The numerous observations described by several authors (e.g. Le Pichon and Sibuet, 

1971; Pinheiro et al., 1992; Malod et al., 1993; Masson et al., 1994; Whitmarsh and Miles, 

1995; Pinheiro et al., 1996) about the reactivation of the West Iberia margin suggest that 

this reactivation occurred essentially in a transpressional strike-slip regime associated to a 

NW-SE Africa-Iberia-Eurasia convergence during the Cenozoic. This tectonic regime 

reactivated the NNE-SSW normal faults that controlled the Mesozoic rifting phase 

(Pinheiro et al., 1996). 

In several recent studies a change in the convergence direction between Africa and 

Eurasia during the Neogene was proposed: (i) NNE since the Upper Oligocene until 

Lower Miocene; (ii) NNW starting on the Middle Miocene until the Upper Miocene; (iii) NW 

since the Upper Miocene (De Vicente et al., 2008), continuing with the maximum 

compression (NW-SE) practically constant until the present (Galindo-Zaldivar et al., 1993; 

De Vicente et al., 1996; De Vicente, 2004). This present day stress regime with WNW-

WSE direction induces the activity of (1) normal faults with direction NW-SE, (2) the 

movement of strike-slip faults NNE-SSW (left movement) and ESE-WNW (right 

movement), and (3) the movement of inverse faults with direction NE-SW (De Vicente et 

al., 2008). 

Today, the main seismicity activity in the Western continental Iberia margin is located at or 

close to the Eurasian/Africa plate boundary, particularly in the Gorringe Bank region, and 

a moderate intraplate seismicity is also associated with Tore Seamount and along the 

offshore extensions of late Variscan basement faults (e.g. Pinheiro et al., 1996; Terrinha 

et al., 2009). 

 

II. 3 The Western Galicia Continental Margin 

The West Galicia margin extends from the Finisterre Cape (~43ºN), in the north, until a 

latitude of approximately 40ºN, in the south. It has been defined as a sediment-starved, 

non-volcanic rifted continental margin (Montadert et al., 1974; Boillot et al., 1979; Sibuet, 

1992; Boillot et al., 1995; Perez-Gussinye and Reston, 2001).

II.3.1 Physiography  

The West Galicia margin shows a complex structural configuration recognizable in the 

seafloor morphology (Reston, 2005). This area can be divided into four main 

morphostructural provinces: a structural high (the Galicia Bank), the Deep Galicia Margin, 

a Transitional zone, and a large basin about 100 km wide with water depths reaching 

3000 m – the Galicia Interior Basin (Figure II.4). The latter, is an intraslope marginal basin 

bounded by NNW–SSE normal faults and controlled by NE–SW transfer faults which 

corresponds to the submerged part of the Lusitanian basin (Alves et al., 2003b). The 

Galicia Bank is the most important of these features, which have been interpreted as 

reactivated extensional horsts (Pinheiro et al., 1996). The Transitional Zone is formed by a 

set of structural seamounts and marginal platforms controlled by normal faults and 

gathered in a NW–SE trend (Vázquez et al., 2008). Finally, the Deep Galicia Margin is 

constituted by a set of extensional rotated blocks (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987;Reston et 

al., 1996a). 

 

Figure II.4 – Bathymetric map of the Western continental Galicia margin (data from GEBCO Digital 
Atlas). This area can be divided into four main morphostructural provinces: GB – Galicia Bank; 
DGM – Deep Galicia Margin; TZ – Transitional Zone; GIB – Galicia Interior Basin. 

 

Despite its complexity, this margin is now considered a reference model to characterize 

the structure of simple-shear asymmetric extensional margins (Boillot et al., 1995; Reston

et al., 1996b), the rift-to-drift transition in the evolution of passive non-volcanic rifted 

margins (Whitmarsh and Wallace, 2001; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2006), as well the 

continental-ocean boundary at non-volcanic passive margins (Beslier et al., 1993; 

Whitmarsh et al., 1996b). 

 

II.3.2 Tectonic Evolution and Structural Control 

The two successive Mesozoic extensional phases have caused a complex fault system 

composed of N-S to NW-SE normal faults and NE-SW transfer faults that corresponds to 

late Variscan structures reactivated during the Mesozoic rifting episodes (Ribeiro et al., 

1979; Pinheiro et al., 1996; Vázquez et al., 2008). The first extensional phase is related to 

the Triassic rift system that formed between Europe, Africa and North America prior to the 

opening of the central Atlantic (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987; Murillas et al., 1990; 

Henning et al., 2004). The second extensional phase took place from the Upper Jurassic 

to the Early Cretaceous, during the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean and the 

progressive northward continental break-up, sometime between 133 and 112My (Mauffret 

and Montadert, 1987; Boillot and Malod, 1988; Pinheiro et al., 1996 Pinheiro et al., 1996; 

Srivastava et al., 1990a). Reston (2005), however, proposed that there were multiple 

phases of extensional faulting during the evolution of this margin in a diachronous 

manner, and these new extensional phases produced fault reactivations in the context of 

a consecutive westward migration of the tectonic activity. Extensional tectonics observed 

in the Galicia Bank region can be correlated with the kinematics of the north Atlantic. 

These tectonic movements can be divided into three main distinct stages: pre-rift, syn-rift, 

and post-ryft (Mauffret and Montadert, 1988; Murillas et al., 1990). 

From the Paleogene until the Miocene, this margin was affected by the compressive 

regime of Cenozoic age, described above, that reactivated the Mesozoic fault system, 

affecting the physiography of the margin (Pinheiro et al., 1996). 

The observed structures in the Western Galicia margin are generally oriented according to 

three predominant directions (Figure II.5): (1) NS (N340° - N020°) normal faults, parallel or 

sub-parallel to the margin; and (2) NE-SW (N055º - N070°) and (3) NW-SE (N115° - 

N135°) transverse faults (Galice, 1979; Mougenot, 1988; Thommeret et al., 1988). 

Vázquez et al. (2008) have also identified large reverse faults trending NE-SW to ENE-

WSW (see Figure II.7). 

Different faults and structural trends are observed in the regions located North and South 

of latitude 42ºN (Galice, 1979; Sibuet et al., 1987; Mougenot, 1988). In the North, like in 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

18 
 

the Galicia Bank, the faults have a predominant orientation of N150º; to the South the 

predominantly directions are N060º and N-S.  

 

Figure II.5 – Structural framework of the NW Iberia continental margin: (1) – basement or 
Mesozoic outcrops; (2) – Seismic Unit 1 outcrop (Upper Eocene – Quaternary); (3) – normal faults; 
(4) – horsts or top of tilted blocks ; (5) – inverse faults (in Mougenot, 1988) 

 

Within the GIB, the most common direction of the basin bounding faults follows a NNW-

SSE to NW-SE trend and is clearly affected by NE-SW transfer faults (Boillot et al., 1989; 

Murillas et al., 1990; Figure II.6). On the basis of this structural framework, an 

approximately NE-SW direction can be inferred for the main Cretaceous stretching 

episode of the basin, i.e Valanginian tectonics (Murillas et al., 1990). However, some of 

the transfer faults were subsequently reactivated as normal faults during the Hauterivian-

Aptian interval (e.g. DSDP Site 398; Murillas et al., 1990) which could be explained by a 

jump to the west of the rift, associated with a possible change in the morphological and 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

19 
 

rheological characteristics of the crust, and by the rotation of the compression direction 

from NE-SW to NW-SE, at the beginning of the Hauterivian (Boillot et al., 1989; Murillas et 

al., 1990). 

 

Figure II.6 – Structural setting of the NW Galicia continental margin and adjacent abyssal domains 
(after Boillot et al., 1989, and Murillas et al., 1990; in Vázquez et al., 2008). 

 

Two types of Cenozoic normal faults have been identified: normal reactivated extensional 

(N–S; NW–SE) or transfer (NE – SW) Mesozoic faults and neoformed faults related or 

unrelated to the basement structure (Vázquez et al., 2008; Figure II.7). 

In summary, three main groups of structural features that have affected the post-rift 

sedimentary units can be identified in this margin: (1) normal faults (NS and NW-SE) of 

Mesozoic age, that have been reactivated and affected the whole post-rift sedimentation 

sequence (Murrillas et al., 1990; Vázquez et al., 2008); (2) folds and flexures observed in 

the Galicia Bank (Vázquez et al., 2008) and monocline folds due to the reactivation of 

normal NW-SE faults (Murillas et al., 1990; Perez-Gussinye et al., 2003); these folds tend 

to affect only the most recent sedimentary units (Vázquez et al., 2008); (3) reverse faults, 

in particular the compressive northwest belt of the Galicia Bank, with a NNE-SSW

direction in the southern segment and an ENE-WSW in the North (Galice, 1979; Malod et 

al., 1993; Vázquez et al., 2008).

Bank Region. The coulours display the multibeam bathymetry (after Ercilla et al., 2006) completed 
by the structural frame (from Vázquez et al., 2008). 

 

II.3.3 Seismic Stratigraphy  

The sedimentary cover of the West Galicia Margin varies from 0 to 4 km comprising 

sediments from the Oxfordian to the Quaternary with an irregular spatial distribution 

(Mauffret and Montadert, 1988). The seismic stratigraphy of the northwestern Iberian 

margin has been defined and refined by several authors (e.g., Mauffret and Montadert, 

1988; Murillas et al., 1990; Ercilla et al., 2008), based on the correlation of an important 

set of seismic data with drilling and well results. Groupe Galice (1979), based on the IODP 

Leg 47b (Sibuet and Ryan, 1979) to the south of Vigo Seamount, and Mauffret and 

Montadert (1987, 1988) based on ODP Leg 103 (Boillot et al., 1987) to the southwest of 

the Galicia Bank, proposed a set of seismic-stratigraphic units limited by unconformities of 

regional significance. 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

21 
 

Murillas et al. (1990) defined seven main Seismic Units (7 to 1, from the oldest to the 

youngest; Figure II.8) which can be grouped into three categories, according to their 

relationship with the structural evolution of the margin: (1) pre-rift units, that comprise 

Seismic Units 7 and 6 (Oxfordian to Berriasian); (2) syn-rift units, that comprise Seismic 

Units 5 and 4 (Valanginian to Aptian); and (3) post-rift units, that comprise Seismic Units 

3, 2 and 1 (Albian to Quaternary) (Boillot and Malod, 1988; Murillas et al., 1990).  

More recently, Ercilla et al. (2008), using single-channel high resolution seismic profiles, 

detailed the previous interpretation (Murillas et al., 1990) of the upper five Seismic Units (5 

to 1, from the oldest to youngest; Figure II.9) dividing Seismic Unit 1 into three sub-units 

(1A, 1B and 1C). These seismic units were observed above a very irregular acoustic 

basement, highly fractured, defining a system of horsts, grabens and half-grabens, and 

local outcrops forming isolated highs and escarpments (Murillas et al., 1990). 

The seismic stratigraphy used in this thesis results from a compilation of the several 

characteristics described for the seismic units of this region by Murillas et al. (1990), using 

multichannel seismic data, and by Ercilla et al. (2008), using single-channel high 

resolution seismic data. A summary of the characteristics of the several seismic units, 

such as acoustic facies, configuration and thickness, can be consulted in Table II.1. 

 

Seismic Unit 1 

Seismic Unit 1 (turbidites and hemipelagites/pelagite of Late Eocene to recent) shows a 

widespread distribution throughout the Galicia Bank region and adjacent Iberia and 

Abyssal Plains. This sedimentary unit has normally a seismic velocity of about 2.2km/s, 

and a thickness of around 1s (TWT). Seismic Unit 1 can be divided in two sequences or 

subunits (1A [upper] and 1B [lower]) by a continuous reflection in the central part of the 

formation (Murillas et al., 1990). Subunit 1A is characterized by good reflection continuity, 

with variable amplitude. This subunit (1A) has been further subdivided by Ercilla et al. 

(2008), into two smaller sequences (1A and 1B): 1A is characterized by high amplitude 

reflections with high lateral continuity, and a uniform thickness of 40-60ms (TWT); 1B is 

characterized by stratified facies with a thickness of 70 to 170ms (TWT), but with poorer 

lateral continuity.  

The subunit 1B (following Murillas et al. (1990) and which corresponds to the Seismic Unit 

1C defined by Ercilla et al. (2008)) has a thickness of 400 to 650 ms (TWT), and both 

authors classified it as having a more transparent aspect. It is classified by reflections of 

high lateral continuity with low acoustic amplitude. In some places, subunit 1B forms 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

22 
 

sedimentary ridges probably associated to contour currents (Murillas et al, 1990). In the 

Galicia continental slope, and in particular on the northern part of the basin, the distinction 

between subunits 1A and 1B is not clear, and Seismic Unit 1 shows a more contorted 

aspect in the shape of faulting, slight folding and gravity-induced slides probably related to 

the Cenozoic tectonism (Murillas et al., 1990). Seismic Unit 1 is locally characterized by 

complex facies associated with cut-and-fill features, slope instabilities and deformed 

deposits close to the structural highs and escarpments (Ercilla et al., 2008). 

 

Seismic Unit 2 

Seismic Unit 2 (Senoniam to Middle Eocene) corresponds to the claystones, marls rich in 

nanno-fossils and pelagites drilled at DSDP site 398 (Sibuet et al., 1979). Seismic Unit 2 

is the sole seismic unit of the margin identified by its commom character throughout the 

West Galicia margin (Moungenot, 1998). In the deeper part of the GIB and in the upper 

continental slope, Seismic Unit 2 drapes over the topography showing a constant 

thickness of 0.2s (TWT), and a velocity of about 2.8km/s. In most of the Western part of 

the Galicia margin, the thickness of this formation can vary between 0.1s to 0.2s (TWT). It 

is characterized by a stratigraphic gap in its base marked by the formation of a prominent 

regional unconformity (Sibuet and Ryan, 1979). Acoustically, Seismic Unit 2 is 

characterized by continuous and discontinuous reflections with relatively high lateral 

continuity and high amplitude. This seismic unit is locally characterized by complex facies 

due to the cut-and-fill features, internal erosive surfaces, and deformed and mobilized 

sediments (Ercilla et al., 2008). The internal reflections of this Seismic Unit have 

subparallel, lenticular, and divergent configurations. Seismic Unit 2 sometimes onlaps 

Seismic Unit 3. Seismic Unit 2 and Seismic Unit 1 are separated, in some places, by an 

erosional unconformity very channeled which can reach 0.5s TWT in depth (Sangree and 

Widmier, 1977). 

 

Seismic Unit 3 

An important stratigraphic gap, attributed to deep oceanic circulation in the northern 

Atlantic, separates the Albian “black shales” (Formation 3) from the Campanian to Eocene 

pelagic sediments (Formation 2) at DSDP site 398 (Sibuet et al., 1979). Seismic Unit 3 

drapes, onlaps and downlaps the horst-and-graben paleotopography and locally infill it. 

The onlaping of this Seismic Unit on the previous deposits indicates a deposition without 

significant tectonism (Murillas et al., 1990). This seismic unit shows a variable thickness 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

23 
 

(few to 220ms, in TWT) and an irregular distribution throughout the West Galicia margin. 

Seismic Unit 3 is characterized by transparent to semi-transparent facies with stratified 

reflections of short lateral continuity and variable amplitudes. Around the structural highs 

and escarpments there is evidence of chaotic facies associated with cut-and-fill features, 

deformed and sliding sediments (Ercilla et al., 2008). In the Transitional Zone, Galicia 

Bank and in the northern GIB lateral changes in the seismic facies are observed, varying 

from transparent to diffractive, possibly associated with tectonic deformation between the 

Cenozoic (Murillas et al., 1990). 

 

 

Figure II.8 – Seismic profile GAP-015 acquired along the Galicia Interior Basin. The two arrows 
represent progradational patterns within the Seismic Unit 3 and sequence 1B (in Murillas et al., 

1990). Vertical scale is in TWT(s). 

 

Seismic Unit 4 

Seismic Unit 4 (Hauterivian to late Aptian) was described as syn-and post-rift deposits of 

turbidite sandstones and siltstones with intercalations of clays and marls, with a variable 

thickness between few to 375ms (TWT) and with a seismic velocity of about 3.8 km/s. 

This seismic unit infills the grabens and locally covers the buried horst-and-graben 

structures of the acoustic basement in the Galicia Bank, Transitional Zone and Galicia 

Interior Basin (Ercilla et al, 2008). The configurations of the infilling reflections are 

classified as subparalell, oblique and divergent. This seismic unit is classified as having a 

transparent and often chaotic, facies with reflections of short lateral continuity with low 

amplitude. Seismic Unit 3 shows pinch-outs against horsts, structural highs and 

escarpments. Its upper limit is defined by a strong reflection which corresponds to the 

latest Aptian break-up unconformity (Murillas et al., 1990). This Seismic Unit does not

show much evidence of relevant tectonic activity during its deposition (Murillas et al., 

1990). 

 

Seismic Unit 5 

Seismic Unit 5 (Valanginian) has been classified as a syn-rift unit with a seismic velocity of 

about 4.7 km/s. It consists of sandstones and claystones, confirmed by drilling at ODP 

Site 638 (Boillot et al., 1987). The seismic facies of Seismic Unit 5 can be classified as 

nearly transparent, diffractive, or distorted, with high amplitude and low-frequency 

reflections. This Seismic Unit is separated from Seismic Unit 4 by a strong unconformity 

(Murillas et al., 1990). In several places, at the foot of fault scarps, there is evidence of 

sedimentary wedges with chaotic internal configurations. These wedges, interpreted by 

Murillas et al. (1990) as gravitational slides contemporaneous with Seismic Unit 5, overlie 

Seismic Unit 6 and are overlapped by Seismic Unit 4.

the Galicia Bank region (from Ercilla et al., 2008). 

 

Seismic Unit 6 

Seismic Unit 6 was primarily defined by Mauffret and Montadert (1987) as a group of 

reflections with high amplitude, low-frequency and moderate continuity, from Late Jurassic 

period (Tithonian to Berriasian). The seismic velocity in this formation is about 5.4km/s. 

Similar facies have been found within the GIB affected by intense faulting. However, 

Seismic Unit 6 has not been clearly identified in the Transitional Zone or in the Galicia 

Bank.

Seismic Unit 7 

Seismic Unit 7 corresponds to the deeper seismic events observed on the seismic 

profiles. Mauffret and Montadert (1987) identified a thick transparent or chaotic interval 

underlying Seismic Unit 6, which was interpreted as an Upper Jurassic sedimentary layer 

deposited during an Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian extensional episode. Murillas et al. (1990) 

also identified some deeper seismic events probably indicating the presence of older 

sedimentary layers, and proposed three possible interpretations for this group of 

reflections: (1) sedimentary sequences from Lower and Middle Jurassic or even from 

Triassic; (2) Paleozoic sediments; (3) intrabasement features of a non-sedimentary origin, 

such as thrusting faults or detachment faults. 

 

Acoustic Basement 

The acoustic basement is characterized by an irregular and diffractive surface, strongly 

fractured, which forms tilted blocks, sometimes with the upper part flat due to erosion 

processes (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987). 

 

II. 4 The Gran Burato Structure 

During the ERGAP 1 and ERGAP 2 scientific cruises (Vázquez et al., 2009) multibeam 

bathymetry and seismic data were acquired in the Galicia continental slope southeast of 

the Galicia Bank which permitted the recognition and study of three large depressions (A, 

B and C). These depression are circular in shape with heights between 100-370m and 

whose size range between 3000 and 5000m (Vázquez et al., 2009). Among these three 

features, there is the called BURATO ERGAP or Gran Burato (Figure II.10). These 

structures are located in water depths between 1600m and 1850m. 

The Gran Burato, or the BURATO ERGAP was first described as one of the most singular 

structures on the West Galicia continental margin, and it has been studied in more detail, 

more recently, by Vázquez et al (2009), Rey et al. (in prep.) and Pinheiro et al. (in prep). 

Vázquez et al. (2009) described and classified this depression as an erosive feature in U-

V shape (transversal section), showing a symmetric section in SW-NE and asymmetrical 

in W-E direction. The flanks are truncation surfaces which provokes erosion of the 

Seismic Unit 1 and Seismic Unit 2. The bottom surface shows very strong reflections with 

chaotic and discontinuous stratified facies. According to Vázquez et al. (2009) this 

depression is situated on top of a small diapir that rises between 800 to 1000ms (TWT), 

and according to the same authors, the material that forms this diapir seems to be the 



Chapter II. Geological Setting of the Study Area 

27 
 

same material as Seismic Unit 3 – “Black shales”. Possibly, this feature is similar to a 

pockmark which the fluid escape is coming from that seismic unit. In both sides of the 

depression is observed an intense normal faulting, which affects the seabottom 

topography. On the west side of the Gran Burato, acoustic anomalies and transparent 

columnar facies interpreted on the seismic sections could indicate fluid venting (Vázquez 

et al., 2009). 

 

Figure II.10 – High resolution multichannel seismic line ERGAP – C21 acquired during the ERGAP 
cruise where it is visible the Gran Burato. 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the seismic units defined by 
Ercilla et al. (2008) (in Vázquez et al., 2009). 

 

According to Vázquez et al. (2009) the genesis of these singular structure must be 

explained in the framework of the Cenozoic Pyrenean compressive events, where faulting 

of the sedimentary cover over a viscous shale layer among other factors can be invoked 

to explain this impressive feature.

Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method 
 

 

The first seismic survey was carried out in the early 1920s (Dobrin and Savit, 1988), as 

the natural development of the long-established methods of earthquake seismology, in 

which the travel times of earthquake waves recorded at seismological observatories were 

used to study the internal structure of Earth, providing information about it composition 

and constitution. In the same way, but in a smaller scale, seismic surveying provides a 

clear and uniquely detailed picture of the subsurface geology. It is nowadays the most 

important geophysical surveying method, not only in terms of the amount of current survey 

activity but also due to its wide range of applications. 

Seismic methods are widely applied to exploration problems involving, for example, to 

map the subsurface regional geology, but also to map the geometry of layered 

sedimentary sequences and in the search for oil and gas. These methods can also be 

used, in a smaller scale, for the study of near-surface geology (using high resolution 

methods), determining the location of the water table and site geotechnical investigation of 

foundations conditions including the determination of the bedrock depth.  

Seismic surveying can be carried out on land (onshore environments) and at sea (marine 

environments). Nowadays, 2D and 3D multichannel seismic reflection are extensively 

used offshore in the search for oil and gas. 

 

III. 1 Basic Principles and Fundamentals 

In the seismic reflection method, the structure of the subsurface geological formations is 

mapped by measuring the time required for a seismic wave (or pulse) emitted at or near 

surface to return to the surface after reflection on the interfaces between formations, 

which have different physical and acoustically properties. The incident wave is split into a 

reflected part that travels upward and a refracted part that continues to propagate 

downward in a slightly different direction (with a different angle), according to the Snell’s 

Law (Equation 1). 

 

        

        
  

  

  
  (Eq.1) 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

30 
 

where    is the incident angle,    is the refracted angle, and V1 and V2 represent the 

velocity of the seismic waves in two different medias. Figure III.1 shows the behavior of 

seismic waves at a layer boundary, such as a bedding plane, assuming there is no wave 

mode conversion. 

 

Figure III.1 – Partial reflection and partial refraction of the seismic wave between two media with 
different physical properties for the simplified case in which there is no wave mode conversion. Vi 
and ?i represents the velocity of the seismic waves and the density of the layers, respectively. In 
the wave general case, for non-normal incidence, there will be wave mode conversion at the 
interface and longitudinal waves (P-waves) are converted to shear waves (S-waves) and vice-
versa. 

 

The time that the reflected waves take to travel since the source until the receivers, where 

they are recorded, is used to derive information about the subsurface geology, as well as 

the rock properties and layers attitude. The two-way travel-time (TWT), is the time that a 

wave takes to travel since it is generated at the source, finds an interface between two 

layers with different density (?), seismic wave velocity (V), i.e. with a contrast of acoustic 

impedance
3
 (Z), where it is reflected, and travels back to the surface where it is recorded 

by the receivers. The Reflection Coefficient (RC) is proportional to the contrast between 

the acoustic impedance and is given by (Equation 2; only valid for normal incidence): 

 

   
          
          

  
      
      

 

In seismic reflection data, usually there is only one data set available and its fundamental 

properties, like resolution, are largely determined by the acquisition parameters and by the

 - Seismic velocity multiplied by densisty. Reflection coefficient at normal incidence depends on 

changes in acoustic impedance (Sheriff, 1991). 

(Eq.2)

system characteristics. Subsequent processing can improve the image resolution but 

within some limits. Therefore, seismic resolution is a matter of prime importance in 

seismic data acquisition (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Vertical resolution 

The vertical resolution of a seismic wave (Figure III.2) is a measure of its ability to 

recognize individual, closely-spaced reflectors and is determined by the pulse length of 

the record seismic section. The vertical resolution increases with increasing wave 

frequency. Frequency is expressed as number of cycles per second (1cycle/s = 1Hertz) 

and higher frequencies means sharper pulses and therefore better resolution. Two 

reflectors, such as the top and the base of a stratigraphic unit, can be recognized as 

separated seismic events only if the distance between them is at least ¼ of wavelength (?) 

of the seismic wavelet, defined by (Equation 3):  

  

   
 

 
  

 

where V is the seismic wave velocity in the layer and f is frequency.  

 

Figure III.2 - Vertical scale of a seismic wavelet: a) A single cycle wave of 30 Hz in medium 
velocity of 1830m/s; b) The Big Ben, London, 115 meters (modified from McQuillin et al., 1984). 

(Eq.3) 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

32 
 

The frequency of waves transmitted into the Earth depends on the type and 

characteristics of the seismic source. However, the frequency changes as the waves 

travel in the subsurface and the seismic wave will lose higher frequencies in depth since 

they are more rapidly absorved. Therefore, high-frequencies waves are attenuated much 

faster than low-frequencies. The higher the frequency the lower will be the penetration, 

but the higher will be the vertical resolution. 

 

Horizontal resolution 

The horizontal resolution of a seismic wave is mainly controlled by the so-called “1
st
 

Fresnel Zone” (Figure III.3; Figure III. 4). The Huygen’s principle states that each part of a 

wavefront acts as a source of a new wave and the area where the waves interfere with 

each other constructively is the area of interest, called the “First Fresnel Zone” (Sheriff, 

1991,1996). The reflected waves will interfere constructively where their travel paths differ 

by less than a half wavelength. Beyond this First Fresnel Zone region interference will be 

alternatively destructive and constructive. In other words, a reflection that is coming back 

to the surface is being reflected not froim a reflector point, but from an area with the 

dimension of the First Fresnel Zone. The radius of the 1
st
 Fresnel Zone depends on the 

seismic velocity (V), the depth of the target (t, in TWT) and the frequency of the seismic 

signal (f) (Equation 4; Sherrif and Geldart, 1995; Sheriff, 1996). 

 

Figure III.3 – Schematic representation of the 1
st
 Fresnel Zone. The energy is returned to the 

receiver from all points of the reflector. The part of the reflector which the energy is reflected within 
half of wavelength of the initial reflected arrival is known as the1st Fresnel zone (Kearey and 
Brooks, 1991). 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

33 
 

The dimensions of the Fresnel Zone can be easily calculated by simple geometry as 

shown in Figure III. 4a, for the case of a plane reflector in case of constant velocity and 

with two-way travel time.  

 

Figure III. 4 – a) Calculation of the radius of the Fresnel Zone using the pythagorean theorem; b) 
nomogram for determining the Fresnel Zone radius. A straight line connecting the two-way time 
and frequency intersects the central line at the same point as a line connecting the average velocity 
and the Fresnel Zone radius (in Sheriff, 1996).  

 

The radius of the First Fresnel Zone, FR, is given by (Equation 4): 

 

   
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

where V is the average seismic velocity on the layer, t is the wave two-way travel-time, 

and f is the frequency of the seismic waves. Thus, the Fresnel zone increases, and 

(Eq.4) 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

34 
 

consequently horizontal resolution decreases, with increasing velocity, increasing travel-

time (depth) and decreasing signal frequency. 

 

III. 2 2D Multichannel Seismic Reflection Surveys 

In the 2D multichannel marine seismic acquisition (Figure III.5) a long seismic streamer of 

hydrophones and a seismic wave source are towed behind the seismic vessel. The 

streamer will be the receiver of the reflected waves that come from the sea subsurface, 

and convert them to an electrical signal. The reflections from the subsurface are assumed 

to come directly from  below the navigation line performed by the research vessel.  

2D seismic lines are typically acquired several kilometers apart, on a broad grid of lines, 

over a large area to image the subsurface geology with good penetration and to look for 

potential hydrocarbon traps. In exploration areas, 2D multichannel seismic surveys are 

always carried out before a 3D survey is planned and executed, and before drilling, to 

obtain a general understanding of the regional geological structure of the area of interest. 

 

Figure III.5 – Typical seismic survey design (modified from http://www.ocean.slb.com). 

 

In general, a seismic acquisition system (Figure III.5) is always composed of (i) a seismic 

wave source that generates the acoustic pulse; (ii) cable or streamer of hydrophones 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

35 
 

(group of receivers) which receives the reflected seismic waves; iii) a recording digital 

system; (iv) amplifiers; (iv) filters; and (v) analog-digital-convertes (ADC) to convert the 

analog signal to digital (McQuillin et al., 1984; Telford et al., 1990). 

 

III.2.1 Marine Seismic Sources 

During the first seismic reflection surveys at sea the seismic wave source was chemical 

explosives. For environmental reasons, this methodology was discontinued, and now 

there is a wide variety of marine seismic sources, all capable of producing large amounts 

of energy, similar to explosive sources. 

For continuous seismic profiling, acoustic sources have been designed to produce a 

intense short duration burst of sound, or in other words, a source signal as close as 

possible to a spike. Seismic sources for multichannel reflection surveys at sea are 

designed to have a very high acoustic energy output, especially in the frequency band 

between 20 and 200Hz (McQuillin and Ardus, 1977).  

The most widely-used seismic sources in multichannel seismic (MCS) surveys, which 

were also used in the BURATO4240 survey, are the airguns (Figure III.6; Figure III.7). The 

airguns are devices that release a high pressure bubble of compressed air underwater 

that acts as a source of energy to generate the acoustic/pressure waves that are used in 

seismic reflection surveys. During the charging cycle, air at high pressure is fed into the 

upper chamber and bleeds through the hollow piston into the lower chamber (Figure III.6). 

To fire the gun, an electrical pulse (electrical triggering) opens the solenoid valve and a 

slug of high pressure air is delivered to the underside of the trigger position. The piston 

shoots upward under the pressure exerted by the compressed air releasing the air in the 

lower chamber into the water. Pressure in the upper chamber then drives the piston back 

to its initial position and the charging cycle recommences. During a period of a few 

milliseconds, all the high pressure air in the lower chamber is suddenly released into the 

surrounding water through centrally located ports, and it is the explosive release of this air 

which provides energy for the initial pulse. This release of high pressure air creates an air 

bubble quite similar to that from a dynamite explosion and gives rise to a repetitive bubble 

pulses at a rate determined by the oscillation period of the air mass thus generated: the 

larger the volume of the air, the longer the period (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  

The dominant frequency of a pulse generated by an airgun is controlled by the air 

pressure, the size of the lower chamber, and by the depth of operation (McQuillin and 

Ardus, 1977).

Figure III.6 – Schematic representation of an airgun. During the charging cycle, air at high 
pressure is fed into the upper chamber and bleeds through the hollow piston into the lower 
chamber (left image). To fire the gun, an electrical pulse opens the solenoid valve and a slug of 
high pressure air is delivered to the underside of the trigger position. The piston shoots upwards 
under the pressure exerted on the firing piston releasing the air in the lower chamber into the water 
(right image) (modified from Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Telford et al., 1990).

Chapter I –Section I.4): a) deployment of the array of airguns; b) detail of the array showing 2 
airguns. 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

37 
 

The primary pulse generated by an airgun is followed by a train of bubble pulses that 

increase the overall length of the pulse (McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988, 

Telford et al., 1990). This effect is called the “bubble effect” and it gives an oscillatory and, 

unsatisfactory reflection record. Special measures are adopted in the design of the 

seismic array and in the individual airguns time shooting, as well in the processing stage 

to attenuate the bubble oscilations. Arrays of airguns of varying sizes and different bubble 

pulse periods can be used to produce a high-energy source in which primary pulses 

interfere constructively (Figure III.8). This technique will give a pulse which has a broad 

frequency spectrum and has the main energy concentrated in the initial pressure pulse; 

the bubble pulses will interfere destructively, so that a pulse as close as possible to a 

spike can be obtained (Figure III.8). The pressure signal actually recorded from the array 

will consist of an impulse representing the sum of the initial pulses from all the guns 

followed by a train of much weaker. Special types of airguns, called GI-Guns were 

especially designed to minimize this effect (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995).

(modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991). 

 

A wide range of airgun chambers sizes is available, leading to different energy outputs 

and frequency characteristics. Using these types of seismic sources this system it is

38 
 

possible to generate seismic waves with less environmental impacts, in safer conditions 

(in comparison with the explosive sources), to have continuous supply of compressed air 

by standard compressor equipment onboard a ship, and it is possible to programme the 

triggering time with very high precision. Also, it is possible to fire all airguns in the array 

simultaneously, or with small delays between them in order to get a sharper signal, which 

will provide a better compressed seismic wavelet, and therefore provide higher seismic 

resolution. 

 

III.2.2 Marine Seismic Receivers 

To receive and record the seismic reflected waves a long hydrophone cable, called 

streamer, is used (Figure III.9). The streamer cable, originally developed for 

antisubmarine warfare in World War II, is the most widely used type of seismic receiver for 

modern seismic recording. This cable consists of a plastic tube, 5 to 8 cm in diameter, 

nearly neutrally buoyant and generally filled with querosene. In common practice, the 

cable is maintained at approximately 1% positive buoyancy so that, in case of cable loss, 

it will float to the surface. The hydrophone elements, wires and transformers are stored 

inside the plastic tube, which is acoustically transparent and generally also optically 

transparent. Inside the tube there are also steel cables, the strain elements that provide 

the mechanical strength to tow the entire length of the cable. The seismic wave passes 

through both the plastic tube and the oil and reaches the hydrophones without noticeable 

interference (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  

The principle of the marine hydrophone is quite simple. Within the hydrophone a 

piezoelectric transducer produces an electrical signal (voltage) in response to the 

pressure changes caused by the passage through the surrounding water of the seismic 

pressure waves. Each crystal element consists of an annular piezoelectric ring, metallic-

coated on both surfaces, bonded at the open ends by thin convex metallic diaphragms 

(Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  

Hydrophones are arranged in sections (“live sections”) and, in each one, there are, 

commonly, at least twenty hydrophones spaced around 1m (Telford et al., 1990). Each 

hydrophone from each live section receives a seismic signal which is summed up together 

and the final result is considered the seismic record (seismic trace) for that live section, 

receiver group or channel. With this summing (stacking) technique the signal to noise ratio 

is largely improved.

39 
 

 

Figure III.9 – a) Hydrophone scheme; b) acceleration-cancelling hydrophone (in Reynolds, 1997). 

 

In seismic reflection surveying with a long towed streamers substantial noise is generated 

due to the vibration of the cable (strumming) and also by the vessel’s movement 

(acceleration/deceleration) both of which are transmitted to the streamer. McQuillin et al. 

(1984) suggest several methods to reduce these noisy effects: 

1. Ship motion is decoupled from the streamer by using an elastic non-active lead-in 

section; this absorbs the ship’s heave motion allowing the cable to be towed at a 

constant speed through the water; 

2. Streamer depths controller -“birds” - are used to maintain a constant depth along 

the length of the streamer; 

3.  Lead-in sections to the cable can be faired (rubber or tissue strips can be 

attached to it) to reduce noise induced by strumming; 

4. Instead of single crystal element hydrophones, dual crystal element hydrophones 

are used which have very low sensitivity to horizontal accelerations, one of the 

main sources of noise problems. 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

40 
 

The streamer (Figure III.10; Figure III.11a) is divided in several components. Figure III.10 

shows a common 480 channel streamer which is towed in actual size.  

 

Figure III.10 – Scheme of a 480 channel streamer (modified from Telford et al., 1990). 

 

The first component is a heavy armored lead-in-cable, usually about 200m long, from the 

ship to the beginning of the neutrally buoyant streamer cable. The heavy, long, lead-in 

cable is used to depress the hydrophone cable to its operating depth and to provide some 

isolation from the pitching and tossing motion of the ship and from the noise of the ship’s 

machinery. Usually rubber strips or sheets, called fairings, are fastened to the forward part 

of the lead-in to cut down the turbulence that ordinarily follows an object towed 

transversely through the water. After the lead-in of the streamer cable there is a section 

called a “stretch” section, or “dead section”, because usually contains no hydrophones 

(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995), and its stress components are made of nylon rope or similar 

resilient material. Much of the vibration that is not attenuated by lead-in is presumed to be 

absorbed by the dead section. The last group of hydrophone is followed by another 

compliant section and a tail buoy (Figure III.11b) which floats at the surface. This tail buoy 

serves to mark the end of the cable and is essential to recover a severed cable, to 

calculate the positioning of the streamer and to reduce the drift of the streamer due to 

water currents (e.g. McQuillin and Ardus, 1977; Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Sheriff and 

Geldart, 1995). 

At suitable intervals along the streamer, 8 or 10 pressure-sensitive depth controllers or 

“birds” are attached (Figure III.11c) to keep the cable at the optimum depth. Each unit 

contains wings that lift or lower the cable, depending on the angle they make with the 

horizontal (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).

on the ship deck; b) tail buoy; c) deployment of the streamer with a “bird” attached. 

 

Among the benefits of using streamer incorporations, such as lead-in sections, as well as 

other noise-reducing design systems is that marine surveys can now be conducted at 

higher tow speeds and in rougher weather conditions; also improved signal to noise ratio 

are obtained, which allow the geophysicist to get deeper information and better imaging 

after data processing (Dobrin and Savit, 1988).  

 

III.2.3 Multi-Fold Coverage Marine Seismic Acquisition  

The quantity and quality of the primary seismic signals recorded at sea are affected by 

many different types of background noise which can be conveniently described in two 

main categories: random and coherent Much depends on field analysis and Quality 

Control (QC) and on the layout design of the seismic source and receivers (McQuillin et 

al., 1984). 

In multichannel seismic survey, if the shot-receiver geometry is moved forward in such a 

way that no two reflected ray paths sample the same point on a subsurface reflector, the 

survey coverage is said to be single-fold, and each seismic trace represents a unique 

sampling of some point along the reflector.  

The most common design for multichannel 2D seismic aims at getting a multi-fold 

coverage, where the reflections from each point along the reflector are recorded in more 

than just one seismic trace, for different shots. Figure III.12 shows a typical marine 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

42 
 

multichannel acquisition system and illustrates how the data is acquired in a way which 

allows multifold coverage and consequently stacking during processing. The use of 

multiple sources, multiple detectors per trace and the summing of common reflection point 

traces (Figure III.12) brings a distinct improvement on the weakest source and even in the 

signal to noise ratio (McQuillin et al., 1984). Before the implementation of multi-fold 

coverage sums or mixes of the seismic traces were often performed successfully. The 

improvement on the signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to ?n where n is the number of 

detecting elements in the acquisition system (the signals which will be added together to 

provide the final record; McQuillin et al., 1984).  

 

Figure III.12 - Diagram showing the multichannel marine seismic acquisition geometry with multi-
fold coverage technique (modified from McQuillin et al., 1984). 

 

Multi-fold coverage, which has been around over the last few decades, is now the 

standard technique for 2D multichannel seismic surveying. The geometry of acquisition is 

set in a way that a set of traces recorded at different offsets for different shots contains 

reflections from a common midpoint (CMP) on the same reflector (Figure III.12; Figure 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

43 
 

III.13). A CMP is a point at the surface located at half-offset between the source and the 

receiver that is common to several source-receiver pairs (Figure III.13).  

In Figure III.13b it is shown that the CMP gather is formed by all the traces from the 

source-receiver (Si-Ri) pairs that correspond to the same commom reflections points. The 

fold refers to the number of traces in the CMP gather that can be summed, and can be 

expressed as a percentage (e.g. single-fold = 100% fold coverage; six-fold = 600% fold 

coverage) or by the number of times the same CMP is sampled (e.g. 20-fold; 60-fold). As 

such, the larger the fold the better will be the data quality. 

 

Figure III.13 - Shot-Receivers (Si-Ri) pairs that share the same reflection point: a) Si-Ri pairs 
according to the geometry shown in the previous figure (modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991); 
b) CMP gather for the first three S-R pairs (modified from www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com). 

 

This method brings a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio due to the 

stacking of n traces containing information about the same reflection point, and attenuates 

or can almost totally suppresses the long-path multiples that have a significantly different 

moveout from the primary reflection (Yilmaz, 1987;Kearey and Brooks, 1991;Yilmaz, 

2001a). 

 

III. 3 The Nature of Seismic Traces 

In seismology, a seismic trace refers to the recorded curve from a single seismograph 

when measuring ground movement. The name comes from the curve plotted by a 

seismograph as the paper roll rotated and the needle left a trace from which information 

about the subsurface could be extracted. Today's instruments record the data digitally and 

the word trace corresponds to the digital signal. 

The particular seismic trace shown in Figure III.14 represents several interfaces of variable 

impedance contrast, two of which with negative reflection coefficient. A negative reflection 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

44 
 

coefficient occurs at a decrease in acoustic impedance across an interface; since density 

is generally quite slowly varying in regions in which exploration seismologists are 

interested, this usually implies a decrease in acoustic velocity. The timing of the 

reflections from a specific interface will vary from trace to trace according to the average 

velocity down to the interface, the depth of interface, and the offset between the source 

and the receiver. This reflection series determines the timing and relative strengths of the 

reflected seismic pulses. 

 

Figure III.14 – The reflection seismogram, or a seismic trace, viewed as the convolution of a 
reflectivity function with a source wavelet (modified from Kearey and Brooks, 1991). For more 
details see, for example, Sherriff and Geldart (1995) – Chapter 9, pps 279-285. 

 

In practice, however,  the seismic trace also contains contributions of undesirable nature, 

in particular (Hatton et al., 1986): 

 i Multiple reflections: 

 ii Coherent noise; 

 iii Random noise. 

 

Multiple reflections 

In addition to the energy returning via a simple reflection, more complex ray paths are also 

possible as shown in Figure III.15. As reflection from more than one interface is involved, 

these returns are collectively known as multiples (Hatton et al., 1986). For all but very 

shallow interfaces, for surveys using medium size streamers, and in areas of a thick water 

column, it can be reasonably assumed that travel paths are vertical. The additional 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

45 
 

distance travelled along these multiple ray paths then result in a constant time delay, 

independent of the receiver offset. 

 

Figure III.15 – Ray paths of some common multiples families (modified from Hatton et al., 1986). 

 

Two classes of multiples: long-path multiples can be distinguished; and short-path multiple 

(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). A long-path multiple is one whose travel path is long 

compared with primary reflections from the same deep interfaces, and thus long-path 

multiples appear as separate events on a seismic record. An examples is the simple 

seabottom multiple and inter-formational multiples. A short-path multiple on the other 

hand, arrives soon after the associated primary reflection so that it interferes with it and 

adds a tail to the primary reflection. This results in a change in the waveshape rather than 

producing a separate event. Examples of short-path multiples are the near-surface 

multiples, the ghosts, and some peg-leg multiples. Ghost reflections are originated by the 

deep tow of the seismic source/receivers and produce a high amplitude pulse of negative 

polarity which follows closely behind the primary pulse, and interfere with it to produce one 

a modified pulse. In practice, both source and receiver ghosts must be included  in the 

seismic wave signature (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

Coherent noise 

According to Hatton et al. (1986) examples of coherent noise are: 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

46 
 

? Direct waves: energy travelling directly along the water, from the source to the 

receiver array. 

? Diffracted waves: energy scattered in all directions from a point scattering, not 

necessarily located in the plane of the survey; 

? Refracted waves: energy striking an interface at the critical angle; 

? Vibrational noise: energy resulting from tug of the boat and the tail buoy on the 

cable in roughish seas, as well as boat noise including source generated noise: 

? Interference: energy generated by other vessels; even a 100 km away vessel 

could generate noise. 

The common characteristic of this kind of noise is the line-up of energy in a 

distinguishable manner across the traces of a shot gather (Larner et al., 1983). Two-

dimensional filtering techniques can be applied to attempt their attenuation. 

 

Random noise 

Randon noise exhibits no correlation from trace to trace, and no specific noise amplitude 

can be predicted from the knowledge of the generating mechanism. It can be generated 

by: 

? Instrument noise: thermal motion of electrons in recording equioment electronics; 

interference; 

? Machinery: compressors and other heavy machinery; 

? Power lines: normally 50Hz or 60Hz can be picked up from the seismic vessel; 

? Cable noise: motion of the streamer through the water. 

Improvements in the design of seismic vessels, instruments and cables are continually 

reducing the effect of the various types of noise described above. Methods of random 

noise reduction are based on averaging techniques and frequency filtering (Hatton et al., 

1986). 

 

III. 4 Basic Seismic Data Processing 

Standard seismic processing flows are completely implemented and well known in the 

industry to increase the seismic vertical resolution, improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the 

data, and to display the seismic events in their correct spatial position, in order to obtain a 

better imaging of the desired geological information contained in the seismic data 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

47 
 

(McQuillin et al., 1984; Dobrin and Savit, 1988; Kearey and Brooks, 1991;Yilmaz, 

2001a,b). 

A common simple processing flow for 2D seismic data is ordinarilly composed of a 

preprocessing stage with demultiplexing, trace editing, amplitude and geometry 

corrections, and it is followed by a processing sequence which normally includes: 

deconvolution, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, CMP stack and 

migration (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Field seismic data normally are recorded in multiplexed format because that is the way the 

sampling is usually done during the data acquisition – successive samples on the tape 

represents the succession of channels at the same instant in time (Dobrin and Savit, 

1988). So, in general, the early stages of processing require channel-ordered or trace-

ordered data. Demultiplex is the first step in processing, in a way to convert the data into a 

organized and usable file format for the next processing steps. The conventional standard 

file format for seismic files, in oil and gas industry, is SEG-Y (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

As mentioned before, the preprocessing stage also includes trace editing which consists 

on the correction or deleting of the noisy or polarity reversed traces. The marine data are 

most of the times contaminated with very low frequency noise due to swell and to 

movements of the streamer. This noise can be easily removed with the application of low-

cut filters. However, if these effects are still observed in some traces, even after apply the 

filter, the common practice is delete them, otherwise they will decrease the signal-to-noise 

ratio of the seismic data (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Following the demultiplexing and trace edit steps, amplitude adjustments are performed in 

order to correct the amplitude decay with time due to spherical divergence and energy 

dissipation in the Earth. The spherical divergence correction is a spatially averaged 

velocity function which is applied to compensate the effects of spherical wavefront 

divergence. Additionally, a gain function is sometimes used to compensate for attenuation 

losses. Finally, the seismic data is adjusted with the acquisition geometry used in the field, 

i.e. the data is corrected for the position of shots and receivers, and the true position are 

stored on trace headers. Many types of processing problems arise at later stages due to 

the wrong setting up of the field geometry, and as a result the stacked profiles can be 

severely degraded (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

After finished the preprocessing phase the seismic processing proceeds to a 

deconvolution. The aim of this step is the improvement of the vertical resolution by 

compressing the source wavelet. Deconvolution is the inverse filtering technique used to 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

48 
 

compress an oscillatory (long) source waveform, often seen on marine data, into a spike 

(unit-impulse function) as closest as possible. Ghosts, seafloor multiples, and near-

surface reverberations can often be attenuated through deconvolution approaches. Many 

deconvolution techniques use the autocorrelation of the trace to design an inverse 

operator that removes undesirable and predictable energy (Dobrin and Savit, 1988). 

Velocity analysis is performed on selected CMP gathers or group of gathers 

(SuperGathers). The output from the velocity analysis is a table of numbers as a function 

of velocity versus two-way zero-offset time (velocity spectrum). The velocity model is then 

used to correct the normal moveout (NMO) of the CMP gathers. The NMO correction 

removes the source-receiver offset in a non-dipping reflector, assuming that the reflection 

travel-time, itself a function of offset, follows a hyperbolic trajectory (Figure III.16a;b). After 

NMO correction the seismic events displayed on a CMP gather are mostly flattened 

across the offset range (Figure III.16b; Yilmaz, 2001a). 

The common midpoint (CMP) stack is the data-compression technique generally used. 

After a detailed velocity analysis and after the NMO corrections, the seismic traces in 

each CMP gather are summed to form a stacked trace at each midpoint location - CMP 

stacking (Figure III.16c). This process will increase the signal-to-noise ratio, will also 

attenuates noise such as multiples and ground roll, because reflected signal and coherent 

noise usually have different stacking velocities (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Figure III.16 – Sorted seismic traces by CMP and NMO corrections: a) Sorted CMP gathers; every 
Si-Ri that corresponds to the same reflection point; b) CMP gather after performed the NMO 
corrections; c) stacked trace with a better signal (modified from http://www.gsj.go.jp). 

 

The last step of a common processing flow is the migration. If a realistic velocity model is 

calculated, the migration process will move the dipping events into their supposedly true 

subsurface positions, will collapse the diffractions, will increase the spatial resolution; and 



Chapter III. The 2D Marine Seismic Reflection Method  

49 
 

corrects amplitudes for geometric focusing effects and spatial smearing (Dobrin and Savit, 

1988; Yilmaz, 2001a). This process can be applied before the stack (pre-stack migration) 

or after it (post-stack migration). The pre-stack migration will be a more time-consumer 

and a heavy computation process, but in many cases it increases the vertical resolution of 

the seismic section. The algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, instead 

of being applied to the stacked data (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

All the processing steps should be quality controlled through the seismic processing job in 

order to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing during the seismic data 

processing (Yilmaz, 2001a,b).

Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of 
the BURATO4240 Survey 

 

 

In the scope of this thesis, the 2D multichannel seismic data acquired during the 

BURATO4240 survey was processed in order to improve the onboard preliminary seismic 

processing with a more carefully and detailed processing flow, particularly in the velocity 

analysis, stack and migration steps. One of the main objectives of the new processing 

was to increase the overall quality of all the acquired seismic sections with a better 

imaging, in particular, of the basement and deeper seismic reflectors. This enhancement 

was mainly achieved by the introduction of a pre-stack time migration step into the 

processing flow. The re-processed seismic lines allowed a better constrained 

interpretation of the subsurface geology. 

The onboard preliminary processing of the seismic data consisted of a short and fast 

sequence of steps with a very simplistic pos-stack migration velocity model. This 

preliminary processing was performed onboard using the ProMAX software, from 

Landmark, which allowed the geophysical team to do a fast and satisfactory preliminary 

processing. One objective of this onboard preliminary processing was to assist the 

decisions concerning the bottom sampling which would be done during the LEG-2 

(Seabottom Sampling) of the BURATO4240 survey. 

The second stage of the seismic processing was performed after the cruise, at the Marine 

Geology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of the University of 

Aveiro with the collaboration of Dr. Dan Herold and Dr. Matthew Rawlston from Parallel 

Geoscience Corporation. In this stage, a more carefully and detailed processing flow was 

built using the Seismic Processing Workshop software (SPW), from Parallel Geoscience 

Corporation. The new processing flow includes, among other improvements, a processing 

step for multiple removal/attenuation and a more detailed velocity analysis. This new 

detailed velocity model was used as input for a pre-stack time migration of the most 

representative seismic lines. 

 

IV. 1 Acquisition Parameters 

In seismic data processing, the reliable information concerning the parameters related 

with the acquisition geometry and the characteristics of the seismic sources and receivers 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

52 
 

used is essential to correctly parameterize the various processing steps. The correct 

definition of the acquisition parameters is fundamental to obtain a good and accurate 

processed seismic profile. An example is the assignment of the acquisition geometry. 

Parameters such as the shooting interval, the channel spacing and the Source-Receiver 

Offset, are extremely important since without them, the seismic processing cannot be 

correctly performed.  

Besides the parameters already mentioned above, the seismic processor also needs to 

know the the sampling interval and the record length of the acquisition system. As the 

seismic source and the seismic receivers are towed below the sea surface their tow-depth 

are also required to correct for the statics. 

In some cases, where the streamer does not have included a GPS antenna to record its 

positioning during the acquisition, and the only positioning data available is from the GPS 

antenna of the vessel (often at close to it center), is necessary to calculate the offsets 

between all the seismic acquisition equipments and the GPS antenna, in order to place 

the acquired seismic profile at its right location. The repositioning of the seismic lines can 

be done within a dedicated seismic processing software or even in a interpretation 

package, such as Kingdom Suite. 

During the BURATO4240 scientific cruise all the above mentioned acquisition parameters 

were confirmed and registered. They are schematically represented in Figure IV.1, and 

summarized in Table IV.1 

 

Figure IV.1 – Schematic multichannel seismic acquisition geometry adopted on the BURATO4240 

scientific survey; S – seismic source; Ci – channel number (not to scale).

Table IV.1 – Seismic Acquisition Parameters. 

Acquisition Parameters 

Seismic Source 
  
Composed of 5 arrays of 2 airguns each (10 airguns in total; 1840c.i.) towed at 7m water depth. The shooting interval 
was 50m and the distance between the stern and seismic source were 30m  
 

Seismic Receiver  
  
The solid state streamer was towed at 7.5m water depth. The streamer used had 156 channels, spaced every 12.5m 
with 12 channels per section. The record length was 10 seconds (TWT) at 1 or 2ms sampling interval, depending on the 
profile. 
 

Source / Receiver Offset 
  
The offset between the source and the receiver was 186.7m along-track and 11.5m cross-track. The GPS antenna was 
81.5m away from the seismic source and 268.2m away from the 1

st
 receiver group. 

 

Ship’s acquisition speed (approximate) 4 knots (2m/s) 

 

Another important topic, dependent of the acquisition geometry is the fold. As explained in 

the Chapter III, the fold refers to how many times a point on a reflector is sampled by 

different Source-Receiver pairs, or in other words, how many seismic traces correspond to 

the same midpoint location. The larger the fold value the better will be the signal-to-noise 

ratio and therefore more constrained will be the velocity determination and better the 

subsurface imaging. 

As the seismic acquisition was carried out with multi-fold coverage there is more than just 

one seismic trace per location. The fold diagram can be easily calculated on the SPW 

software. The geometry of each seismic file (that corresponds to a single seismic line) 

must be assigned and inserted into the corresponding trace header locations (see Section 

IV.3.3 Flow1). The geometry needs to be carefully defined first since the process called 

CMP Fold extracts the CMP locations, which are derived from the geometry definition, in 

the seismic trace headers (Figure IV.2).  

 

Figure IV.2 – SPW processing flow used to calculate the seismic fold. 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

54 
 

A fold diagram for two seismic lines is presented in Figure IV.3. From this figure, we can 

conclude that the maximum fold number for the seismic lines used for this works is 20, 

which is not very high, due to limitations of the compressors during the seismic 

acquisition. As expected, the fold value is larger in the central part of the seismic line 

when compared with the edges. 

 

Figure IV.3 – Fold coverage along two seismic profiles: GB-23 (upper image) and GB-32 (lower 

image). As expected, at the edges, the fold is lower than in the middle of the seismic section. 

 

IV. 2 Preliminary Onboard Data Processing 

Preliminary seismic data processing of all the 2D multichannel seismic lines acquired 

during the BURATO4240 survey was performed onboard during the acquisition cruise, 

using the ProMAX software (Seismic Data Processing Software - Landmark). This 

preliminary processing was performed by the geophysical team headed by Prof. L. M. 

Pinheiro (University of Aveiro) which included R. Alpiste (University of Granada), H. 

Duarte (LNEG – National Laboratory of Energy and Geology), L. Azevedo (University of 

Aveiro/IST) and the author of this thesis (University of Aveiro). A brief description of the 

processing adopted flow is presented below. 

 

IV.2.1 The ProMAX Software 

The ProMAX interactive seismic data processing is a software developed by Landmark – 

Halliburton, which combines an easy data management environment, effective analysis 

tools, excellent processing algorithms, and productivity tools.  

For MCS processing purposes Landmark offers several products: ProMAX 2D, ProMAX 

3D, ProMAX VSP, ProMAX MVA, 3DPSDM (3D Prestack Depth Migration), Crooked Line, 

and ProMAX 4D. For this work, during the acquisition cruise, only the ProMAX 2D module 

was used. 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

55 
 

The ProMAX 2D seismic processing system was first introduced in 1989, and has grown 

into a UNIX workstation-based, for interactive and batch analysis and processing of 2D 

seismic data. It consists of several applications, both disk-based and tape-to-tape 

input/output, and includes parallel processing capabilities. 

The ProMAX 2D desktop window can be divided in three main domains (Figure IV.4):  

? The Work Tree, where the user has all the information about the flow, datasets, 

and all the files created during the processing job; 

? The Flow Editor; where the user can build the processing flows and run them;  

? The Processing List, which has all the available processing steps that can be used 

and linked together to build a processing flow. 

 

Figure IV.4 – ProMAX 2D window. 

 

IV.2.2 Onboard Preliminary Processing Flows 

The adopted onboard processing flow was composed of five main processing flows: Flow 

1: Geometry Assignment; Flow 2: Frequency Filtering; Flow 3: Velocity Analysis; Flow 4: 

Stack; and Flow 5: Post-Stack Time Migration. 

 

IV.2.2.1 FLOW 1 - Data Input  

The seismic lines acquired during the BURATO4240 survey were recorded in 

demultiplexed SEG-D format which consists of one file per shot. Each acquired line 

begins with the Field File Identification (FFID) number 99. This FFID 99 refers to a test 

shot made each time that the acquisition system starts, and consequently for processing, 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

56 
 

it needs to be discarded. Then, each of the recorded shots produces a new seismic file 

saved with a name corresponding to the respective FFID number, stored in the trace 

headers. Each of the recorded SEG-D seismic file consistes of 156 channels in which the 

first three channels, marked in the header as negative, are Auxiliary Channels, which 

were not used for processing purposes. The seismic files were loaded into ProMAX using 

the Channel Marker as the primary sorting key to ensure that the files were read from 

channels 1 to 156.  

In the trace headers there is also information about the pre-amplifier device of the 

streamer, in this case a Sercel 408XL (Figure IV.5). This pre-amplifier produces an 

undesirable low frequency noise in the data that has to be removed in the early stages of 

seismic processing. 

 

Figure IV.5 – ProMAX 2D processing flow 1 – Data Input. 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

57 
 

After all the seismic data being correctly imported, the data was saved into internal 

databases of the processing system and a shot-by-shot screening was performed in order 

to identify potential problems in individual shots, such as wrong delays, bad channels, 

high noise, miss-shots or shot desynchronization. All these problems, when found, 

depending on their effect on the processing were marked for later correction, or 

immediately removed. 

The initial seismic lines which were acquired at 1 ms sample interval were resampled to 2 

ms, which was the sampling interval selected for the other seismic lines. 

 

IV.2.2.2 FLOW 2 - Geometry Assignment 

The next step in the seismic processing is the assignment of the acquisition geometry. 

This is set to determine the horizontal offset of every trace and to calculate the position of 

the various CMP?s (Common Mid Points). This information is automatically inserted into 

the seismic files trace headers. 

For the geometry definition, the minimum and maximum offset were calculated. The 

Minimum offset is defined as the distance between the center point of the source array 

and the middle point of the first group of hydrophones, located in the first active section of 

the streamer; for this geometry layout the minimum offset is 186.7m (Figure IV.1). The 

maximum offset is defined as the distance between the center point of the source array 

and the middle point of the last receiver group; in this case 2124.2m (Figure IV.1). The 

calculated CMP interval is 6.25 meters, with a CMP fold of 20. The values concerning the 

CMP and Offsets were loaded into the project database and the shots? FFIDs were 

renumbered to start at 100. At this stage the data was also corrected for static shifts due 

to the different depths of the seismic sources and receivers. 

In ProMAX 2D, the process to assign the geometry to the file headers is called 2D Marine 

Geometry Spreadsheet (Figure IV.6), where all the information about the acquisition 

parameters, presented above in Table IV.1, must be inserted. Next, the geometry 

parameters are loaded into the headers of the seismic files (a, in Figure IV.6) 

Still on this flow, a Bandpass filter (Ornsby filter) with a low-cut frequency of 15Hz and a 

high-cut frequency of 200Hz was applied (b, in Figure IV.6). 

To correct the amplitudes decay with depth (time in the seismic profile) a True Amplitude 

Recovery (TAR) processing was added to the processing flow. This TAR applies a time 

variant gain function to the seismic traces to compensate for the loss of amplitude due to 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

58 
 

wave front spreading and attenuation, using a spherical divergence correction and a gain 

function increasing 1.5dB per second (c, in Figure IV.6). 

The output seismic file is a seismic file with the assigned geometry, filtered in the 

frequency domain for noise attenuation, and with statics and amplitudes corrections. 

 

 

Figure IV.6 – ProMAX 2D processing flow 2 – Geometry; the Parallel End and Parallel Begin 
steps allow running the processes in parallel processors, using full advantage of mulit-processing 
systems.

IV.2.2.3 FLOW 3 - Velocity Analysis 

This is one of the most fundamental steps in multichannel seismic processing and 

involves the determination of the seismic velocity on CMP/CDP gathers, in order to correct 

for the Normal Moveout effect of the gathers, and produce a Stacked Seismic Section 

(see details of theory in section IV.3.2 – Flow 1). 

Successful stacking, multiple attenuation, and time and depth migration, are seismic 

processing steps that require proper velocity inputs and that is why this operation is 

fundamental. For this purpose, CMP supergathers were created. The supergather 

database calculated consisted of a set of chosen CMP traces, at defined intervals. For this 

survey, intervals of 25, 50 or 100 CMPs were used, depending of the total amount of 

CMPs in each individual seismic line. The CMP fold, the first CMP to analyse, the last 

CMP to analyse, the CMP interval and the number of CMP?s to combine (bin) to obtain the 

best velocity semblance computing, were defined (Figure IV.7).  

Interactive Velocity Analysis was performed on the supergathers in order to pick the best 

stacking velocities (Figure IV.8). The minimum and maximum velocities specified for 

velocity analyses were 1450m/s and 4000 m/s, respectively, with 151 semblance 

calculations. Maximum velocity semblance values were determined and marked for 

tabulation, from the first bottom arrival to approximately 8000 ms.  

At about 200 ms below the first arrival, an inverted velocity reflector was found, which 

appears to be created due to a desynchronization of the airguns in the source array, 

appearing a second shot (same polarity), with lower intensity, 200 ms after of the main 

shot. After velocity picking, a velocity QC display was used to check the quality of the 

data. 

The Normal Moveout Correction (NMO) was performed after the picking of the velocity 

model. This step corrects the time shift for each trace in a gather due to the offsets 

between receivers and sources on the arrival time corresponding to a same reflection 

point; as such, reflections from the same reflector will be summed together and the signal-

to-noise ratio and the quality of the seismic data will be increased. In a nutshell, the NMO 

step corrects the data to the zero-offset location. If the reflector has no significant local 

dip, which can often be assumed as a first approximation in the initial processing, this 

correction is the only one needed; in the presence of significant dips, other 

approximations need to be taken, such as the Dip Moveout Correction (DMO).

IV.2.2.4 FLOW 4 - Brute Stack 

A brute stack consists on a processed seismic record that contains traces from a NMO 

corrected common midpoint gather that have been added together horizontally. Stacked 

sections have an overall increase of the signal-to-noise ratio, since random noise is 

cancelled in the summation process.  

The NMO correction applied to the data before the stack, was based on the RMS (Root 

Mean Square) velocity model previously picked. After this NMO correction, the several 

CMP?s were stacked together, and a stacked section was obtained (Figure IV.9). A 

stacked section is shown in Figure IV.12a.

IV.2.2.5 FLOW 5 - Post-Stack Time Migration 

The previous stack was performed with the simplistic assumption that the seismic 

reflectors are roughly. As such, the reflectors in a stacked seismic section will not be 

correctly positioned and seismic migration (see a detailed explanation in IV.3.2 – Flow 6) 

needs to be applied to correct for this effect. Migration can be applied after the stack 

(post-stack migration) or before stack (pre-stack migration). This processing step is 

essential in complex geological environments, whenever the geological structures vary 

laterally and have important dips, since it will move the dipping events, in the up-dip 

direction, on the seismic section, from their apparent locations to their true locations, in 

time (or depth). 

Besides correcting for the reflectors geometry, the migration process also collapses 

diffractions caused by the scattering of the seismic energy in sharp discontinuities. In 

some specific cases, such as when there is a need to image deep reflections, seismic 

sections are migrated from time (TWT) into depth. In these situations, a much more 

detailed velocity analysis and ray trace modeling is needed. For long offset data, pre-stack 

velocity analysis can then be performed. Nevertheless, without a good velocity control, the 

depths in depth-converted seismic sections are always approximate, whereas the sections 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

63 
 

in time are correct. For this reason, geophysicists normally prefer to show the data on 

Two-Way Time (TWT) and perform depth conversion only when necessary. 

For the onboard processing purpose, a Kirchhoff migration algorithm was applied to the 

data. This method uses the integral form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. All 

methods of seismic migration involve the backpropagation (or continuation) of the seismic 

wavefield from the region where it was measured (Earth's surface) into the region to be 

imaged. In the Kirchhoff migration, this is done by using the Kirchhoff integral 

representation of the acoustic field at a given point as a (weighted) superposition of waves 

propagating from adjacent points and times. Downward continuation of the wavefield 

requires a background model of seismic velocity, which is usually a model of constant or 

smoothly varying velocity. Because of the integral form of Kirchhoff migration, its 

implementation reduces to stacking the data along diffraction hyperbolas that trace the 

arrival time of energy scattered by image points in the earth. 

There are several main parameters that need to be known before applying a Kirchhoff 

Migration, and these must be tested before the production of a final migrated section: 

? Trace spacing: This is the CMP spacing for zero-offset or stacked seismic data. 

? Dip limits: The correct impulse response up to 90º is given by a semi-circle; 

however the migration can be limited to shallower dip angles if required. This can 

be used to speed computation time and filter dipping noise. 

? Migration aperture: In theory diffractions extend to infinite time and distance, but in 

practice the useable amplitude is much less than infinite so an aperture is chosen 

over which to make the summation. The aperture may be measured in distance 

and should be large enough to encompass the largest lateral movement envisaged 

from the highest velocity and steepest dip in the section. The migration aperture in 

most of the 2D multichannel seismic data, corresponds to the streamer length; 

? Frequency limit: Some implementations also request frequency limits; this is 

generally chosen as the maximum frequency of the data, with significant energy, 

as determined from the corresponding frequency spectra. 

For the onboard processing, a maximum dip of 20 degrees was used and a migration 

aperture of 2200m was selected. The maximum frequency to migrate was set to 250 Hz, 

which is the maximum frequency on the original signal data (Figure IV.10). An example of 

the application of post-stack Kirchhoff Migration to one of the processed seismic lines is 

presented in Figure IV.12b.

Over the migrated seismic section a top Mute was applied to remove the first arrival noise 

and the effect of the migration above the seabottom. As soon as a satisfactory processed 

seismic section was obtained, the data was exported as a standard SEG-Y file, in order to 

be imported on a conventional seismic interpretation system. The SEG-Y data was 

exported in IBM 16-bits real format.

IV. 3 Seismic Data Re-Processing 

As stated before, one of the main aims of this work was to improve the onboard 

preliminary processing of acquired seismic lines. This was carried out at the Marine 

Geology and Geophysics Laboratory of the Geosciences Department of the University of 

Aveiro, Portugal, in the scope of the present thesis.  

In order to accomplish this objective, the Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) software 

from Parallel Geoscience Corporation was used and a more detailed processing flow was 

designed. A more detailed velocity model was obtained, and for some selected lines a 

pre-stack time migration was applied. 

 

IV.3.1 The Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) Software  

Seismic Processing Workshop (SPW) is a software package for  seismic data and Ground 

Penetration Radar (GPR) processing developed by Parallel Geoscience Corporation 

(PGC). Originally developed for Macintosh platforms, SPW has been redesign and 

rewritten and is nowadays available for Windows XP, Windows 2000, Linux, and 

Macintosh PowerPC operating systems. 

Several SPW software licenses are available at the Geology and Geophysics Marine of 

the University of Aveiro. These consists of four separately applications: i) FlowChart 

Executor, ii) SeisViewer; iii) Vector Calculator; iv) I/O Utility (Figure IV.13). 

 

Figure IV.13 – Seismic Processing Workshop opening window with the 4 available modules 
highlighted in: yellow – FlowChart; blue – SeisViewer; red – VectorCalculator; green – I/O Utility. 

 

IV.3.1.1 FlowChart / Executor 

FlowChart (Figure IV.14) is the SPW?s processing application. It allows the development 

of the processing flows and setting the parameters for each processing step. The 

FlowChart application contains four basic sub-windows: the FlowChart window, for 

creating a processing flow; the Processing List; the Tool Palette; and the Console (Figure 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

68 
 

IV.14). In this module each processing step can be thought as a “box” that can be linked 

with other processes in order to build a sequential net with all the desired processes. The 

available processing steps are organized into 18 categories on the Processing List, where 

each one has a large list of processing algorithms. 

The Executor application is the part of the SPW system that runs the processing flow after 

it has been built in the FlowChart. It reports such things as processing activity, job errors, 

and job status. The Executor has a DOS type console window for a user interface, and it 

is capable to run jobs sequentially.  

 

Figure IV.14 – FlowChart window. 

 

IV.3.1.2 SeisViewer 

The SeisViewer application is the seismic data display component of the SPW where the 

user can display seismic sections in SEG-Y format or in the SPW?s internal processing 

format (Figure IV.15). SeisViewer allows a complete customization of the seismic display. 

In each seismic display there are several options which allow the configuration of the 

seismic input (select the input data) and of the seismic viewer (set-order, scales, 

colorbars, amplitudes display). Besides the conventional seismic display, this module 

allows the possibility to perform some “on the fly” processing steps (such as the 

application of frequency filters, deconvolution, etc.) to quickly test processing parameters 

which can then be set-up in the processing module (Flowchart).

IV.3.1.3 Vector Calculator 

The SPW VectorCalculator (VC) (Figure IV.16) is a trace analysis tool that operates like  

vectorial scientific calculator. It can operate using scalar numbers as well as one-and two-

dimensional vectors, and it can be used for simple mathematical functions or to analyze 

seismic trace data. For example, with this tool, it is possible to create plots of seismic 

traces and calculate and display frequency spectra or autocorrelation function for a single 

seismic trace or a set of seismic traces.

IV.3.1.4 I/O Utility 

SPW I/O Utility consists of a set of applications for file input, output and reformat (Figure 

IV.17). It has six main features, which may be accessed upon opening the application: 1) 

Tape Analysis, 2) File Analysis, 3) Data Reformat, 4) Tape Image Copy, 5) SPW File 

Merge and 6) Tape Image Verify and 7) Create File Index.  

The I/O module, among other applications, allows the conversion between seismic 

formats, such SEG-Y into the SPW internal format, in order to properly process the data 

(Figure IV.17). Upon completion of the processing job, the user can return to this 

application and re-convert the seismic file form SPW internal format to SEG-Y, for 

exporting to other processing or interpretation software packages. 

 

Figure IV.17 – I/O Utility window. 

 

IV.3.2 SPW Re-Processing Data Flows 

The re-processing of the seismic data was carried out in order to increase the resolution 

of the data and thus obtain a better imaging for all the seismic sections. This task was 

performed using several processing steps, including Geometry; Velocity Analysis; 

Deconvolution; CMP sort; Radon Demultiple; Dip Moveout/Pre-Stack time migration; 

Bandwidth Extension and Post-Stack time migration.

IV.3.2.1 Data Reformat 

Before starting the seismic processing, the original SEG-D seismic files were converted 

one-by-one into the SPW internal format using the I/O Utility module (Figure IV.18). 

 

Figure IV.18 – I/O Utility and parameters used to reformat the original SEG-D files into the SPW 

internal format. 

 

IV.3.2.2 FLOW 1 - Geometry 

The processing flow 1–Geometry is composed by the following processes: Static Shift 

correction, Geometry Definition; Frequency Filtering; Amplitude Correction; and 

SuperGathers calculation and Velocity Analysis. 

 

Static Shifts 

Static corrections are applied to seismic data to time-shift all the seismic sources and 

receivers to the same reference datum (the sea-surface, in this case), compensating for 

the effects of variations in elevation, weathering thickness and weathering velocity.  

Static correction algorithms determine the reflection arrival times which would have been 

observed if all measurements had been made on a flat plane. In marine seismic 

acquisition, there are no topography effects, except for wave swell, and therefore the 

static corrections are applied to correct the different tow depths of the seismic sources 

and receivers to the sea surface. 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

72 
 

The statics corrections are important because statics errors can severely distort the 

recorded reflection hyperbolae (Yilmaz, 1987). These distortions are more critical in 

onshore data, but on marine data processing it is also necessary to compensate for the 

tow differences between sources and receivers. 

As referred to before in the acquisition geometry section (IV.1), the seismic sources and 

receivers tow depths were 7m and 7.5m, respectively. To correct for the source-receiver 

tow-depth it is necessary to sum the sources and receivers depth and convert the result to 

time, using a constant seismic velocity for the water layer. For this purpose, this depth 

was converted to time, giving a result of 9.6667 ms (7m+7.5m = 14.5m; 14.5m/1500m = 

9.6667ms).  

In SPW, the static correction process is called Static Shift and a value of 9.6667ms was 

inserted for this process. The result is a corrected seismic trace that honours the true 

water depth (Figure IV.20).

Static Shift correction; b) the same shot gather with Static Shift processing applied. 

 

Geometry Assignment 

The correct configuration of the relative positioning of the seismic sources and receivers is 

crucial for a precise and accurate seismic processing and velocity analysis. After this 

processing phase the correct location of each shot, seismic receiver and CMP location are 

written into the headers of the seismic file. A mistake in this step has a large impact on 

later processing stages (e.g. migration); therefore it is necessary to pay an extreme 

attention to geometry assignment. 

For the geometry assignment of marine seismic data it is necessary to define some 

seismic acquisition parameters such as: the shooting interval, the source and receivers 

tow depths, the number of active channels, the channel interval and the source-receiver 

offset. These seismic acquisition parameters can be consulted in Table IV.1. 

SPW works with its own SPW units and not with real geometry parameters. Consequently, 

in order to set this process correctly, the first step is to select a value which will 

correspond to an integer SPW unit. Normally, for the SPW unit a number that can be 

multiple of both the seismic shooting interval and the channel spacing is chosen.  



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

74 
 

Concerning the Gran Burato dataset the shooting interval and channel spacing is 50m and 

12.5m, respectively. So, since 50m is a multiple of 12.5, the defined SPW unit 

corresponds to 12.5m (1 SPW = 12.5m and 2 SPW = 25m). A summary table with all the 

necessary measurements for the geometry assignement concerning the real and SPW 

units are presented in Table IV.2. 

To assign the geometry in SPW, the processed called Geometry Definition is used. The 

Geometry Definition needs as inputs spreadsheets (designated as SPW File Cards), with 

the location for all the sources (Source Location file card), all the receivers (Receiver 

Location file card), and an Observer Notes SPS file which relates the sources with the 

receivers locations for each shot. The Geometry Definition step computes the CMP 

number based on the source and receiver location, as: CMP Location = (Source Location 

+ Receiver Location) / 2. 

 

Table IV.2 – Acquisition parameters: true distances and corresponding SPW units. In order to get 
only integer values the true distance of the Source-Receiver Offset was slightly changed (from 
186.7m to 187.5m), but this will be compensated at a later stage on the source card (no errors will 
be committed; see explanation below in the text).  

 

 

For the Source Locations – SPS Format card, the position of each source location must 

be given. This SPW file card is divided into 5 columns: Source Line; Source Location; 

Easting; Northing; and Depth. In 2D seismic data the first column (Source Line) is filled 

with the number of the seismic line that is being processed. The second one – Source 

Location – corresponds to the positions of each shot. The first position is an arbitrary 

number, and the next ones should be spaced according to the shooting interval in SPW 

units (4 units, in this case, since the shot interval is 50m). 

Figure IV.21 shows an example of a Source Location card, in which the first position was 

arbitrary defined as 1000; the second shot position is consequently 1004 (4 SPW units 

that corresponds to the shooting interval). This card will have many rows as the total

number of shots of the corresponding seismic line. On the remaining two columns 

(Easting and Northing), and for 2D seismic data, there is only the need to fill one (normally 

Northing) with the correct coordinate or with an arbitrary number like 100000m. Here the 

precise navigation was not used since lines are generally either E-W ou N-S. The 

navigation was included when the SEG-Y processed files were uploaded into the package 

Kingdom Suite, for interpretation. Since this column works with true distance, the 

increment will correspond to the true shot spacing (50m). Thus, for this example, shown 

here, the first row will be 100000, the second 100050, and so on. The Easting column it is 

filled with zeros. The elevation is the tow depth of the seismic source, and in this specific 

case it was 7m. 

 

Figure IV.21 – Source Locations – SPS Format card; specific case for seismic line GB-23; the row 
number 360 corresponds to the last shot and is equivalent to the total number of shots of this 
seismic line. Note in the Northing column the corrected values for the source-receiver offset 
adjustement (see explanation below on the text). 

 

The Receivers Locations – SPS Format card is filled following the same criteria as used 

for the Source Location file card. The column of the Receiver line, Easting and Elevation 

are filled as the same way as explained above. For the receiver location column the 

inserted values should correspond to the positioning of every location that the receiver will 

have during the seismic acquisition in SPW coordinates. This card must take into account 

all the receivers locations; they will range between the last receiver of the first shot until 

the location of the first receiver for the last shot. The position of the last receiver for the 

first shot is the first shot location minus the Source-Receiver Offset distance plus the width 

of the streamer until the last receiver group. As an example for the first shot, we must 

subtract to 1000 (Source Location of the first shot) 187.5 which is the Source-Receiver 

Offset, and 155*12.5, which is the width of the streamer between active section. However, 

for the receiver location column, we must use SPW Units which is 830. Notice that since 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

76 
 

the Source-Receiver Offset is not a multiple of the SPW unit (12.5) we consider this value 

as 15 SPW units. The remaining 0.8m will be subtraced to the Northing column of the 

Source Locations card and this will correct fot the fact that the true offset is 186.7m and 

not 187.5m (see Figure IV.21). Next rows will increase by 1 since the receiver spacing is 

equal to 1 SPW unit. The Northing column follows the same rule, now with real distances. 

The Northing of the last receiver of the first shot is: 100000 (Shot Location) subtracted by 

187.5m, and by 155*12.5 (streamer width of the active section), resulting in 97875. The 

Receiver Locations – SPS Format filled from an arbitrary line is show in Figure IV.22. 

 

Figure IV.22 – Receiver Location– SPS Format card; specific case of the seismic line GB-23. 

 

The Observers Notes – SPS Format card is constituted by 9 columns: Field File; Source 

Line; Source Location; First Channel; Last Channel; Channel Increment; Receiver Line; 

First Receiver; and Receiver Increment (Figure IV.23). The first column should be filled 

with the original Field File Number (FFN) which can be found on the SEG-Y seismic file. 

For 2D seismic data the Source and Receiver Line columns should be filled exactly as 

description above for the Source and Receiver Location file cards. The first and last 

channel columns correspond to the original first and last channel of the streamer used 

during the seismic acquisition. Finally the column denominated as Channel Increment 

must be filled with the SPW unit value that corresponds to the real distance between 

receiver groups. In marine systems, it is very common to make negative the SPW 

distance between channels, since the receivers are placed in an opposite direction of the 

acquisition path, behind the acquisition vessel and behind the source array. The Observer 

Notes card has as many rows as the numbers of shots. An example of an Observer Notes 

– SPS Format card, filled for an arbitrary line, is show in Figure IV.23. 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey

Figure IV.23 – Observer Notes – SPS Format card; specific case of the seismic line GB-23. Note 
that the values on the first and last row must coincide with the values from Source Locations and 
Receiver Location cards. 

 

As a quality check for the geometry parameterization, after filling the 3 geometry cards: i) 

the last shot on the Source Location card has to be the same has the last shot on the 

Observer Notes (Figure IV.21; Figure IV.23); ii) the last first receiver location on the 

Receiver Locations card has to be the same as the last receiver on the Observer Notes 

(Figure IV.22; Figure IV.23). 

The next figure is a schematic representation that summarizes how to set the correct 

geometry for a 2D seismic line in SPW, and how the real coordinates of shot points and 

receivers are related with the SPW ones (Figure IV.24). An Excell spreadsheet was 

developed to perform these calculations.

distances, and the red values represent the same distance in SPW units (1SPW = 12.5m). 
Following the acquisition geometry, the first shot position can be defined as 1000; the Source-
Receiver offset was 187.5m; the shooting spacing 50m; and the spacing between channels 12.5m, 
with a total of 156 channels. The calculus of the geometry with true distance (e.g. to fill the Northing 
column) is done the same way, but using the true values (blue color). Si - Shot number; Ci -

Frequency Filtering 

After the static shifts corrections have been made and the geometry correctly assigned, a 

frequency band-pass filter was applied to the data in order to eliminate the undesirable 

frequencies and therefore to increase the signal-to-noise ration of the seismic data. 

The seismic frequency component of the data is the basis for most of all seismic 

processing techniques, and also plays a significant role in static corrections, velocity 

analysis, deconvolution, filtering, stacking and migration. Unlike seismic amplitudes, the 

importance of the frequency component is not apparent to naked eye, since it acts in the 

background or behind the scene in data processing techniques (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

Frequency displays may be used as one of the myriad seismic attributes for direct 

hydrocarbon indicators in certain type of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Frequency variations 

due to processing techniques are also used as a tool to quality control seismic data 

processing. The high frequency content is desired in seismic sections for a better 

resolution allowing the interpretation of thin-layer target formations (Hatten et al., 1986; 

Yilmaz, 2001a) 

To maintain the frequency content of the seismic signal within a certain range of interest 

(to preserve the information desirable), frequency filters are applied to the seismic data. 

The frequency filters discriminate against selected frequency components of an input and 

can be band-pass, band-reject, high-pass (low-cut) or low pass (high-cut) filters in terms 

of their frequency response. All of these filters are based on the same principle – 

construction of a zero-phase wavelet with an amplitude spectrum that meets one of these 

four specifications (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

The main aim of designing a frequency filter is to pass a certain bandwidth with little or no 

modification, and to largely suppress the remaining part of the spectrum as much as 

possible, without creating edge effects. Band-pass filtering is commonly used, because a 

seismic trace typically contains both low-frequency noise, such as ground roll or other, 

and some high-frequency ambient noise. Frequency filtering can be performed at various 

stages in data processing (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Low-frequency noise on marine seismic data is frequently observed, induced by the swell 

or by the streamer movement. On the seismic lines processed in the scope of this thesis, 

this low-frequency content is well visible and completely obscures the seismic signal 

(Figure IV.25).

79 
 

 

 

Figure IV.25 – Shot gather of the seismic line GB-01, showing the low-frequency noise affecting 

the quality of the seismic signal. 

 

In order to correctly parameterize the filters, a frequency spectrum must be firstly 

calculated. The frequency spectrum can be calculated using the VectorCalculator and 

selecting from the seismic section a single seismic trace or a set of seismic traces (Figure 

IV.26). 

It can be concluded that the seismic traces have a strong low-frequency content that has 

to be removed. The high-frequency content seems free of disturbing noise (Figure IV.26). 

For low frequency noise, a Butterworth Filter, was applied to the data. In SPW, this kind of 

filter is applied using the Butterworth Filter routine. As input parameters the user must 

specify the low pass, high pass and high and low rolloff rates in decibels (dB; the length of 

the taper) and the phase of the applied filter (zero or minimum phase) (Figure IV.27).

frequency content is easily identified (red box); the removal of the frequencies below 6Hz is 
advised.

the low cut option was selected and the 6Hz were choose for the low frequency cut value letting the 
remaining frequencies as originally recorded. A zero-phase filter was selected. 

 

The enhancement provided by the Butterwoth filter on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data 

is clearly observed on the seismic profile shown in Figure IV.28.

(a) and the filtered seismic section (b). Also of notice is the difference in the frequency spectra of 

both the unfiltered with a huge component of low-frequencies (c), and the filtered (d). 

 

Amplitude Correction  

Most of the seismic processing techniques operate on the amplitude content of the 

seismic data. In fact, the final processing data frequently presents a different amplitude 

content when compared with the original seismic data. In adition, relative amplitude 

displays are commonly used, in particular those that enhance the presence of direct 

hydrocarbon indicators. 

There are many factors which affect the amplitude of the seismic signal as it propagates 

through the Earth. One of them is the low-pass filter behavior of the Earth?s subsurface, 

where the high frequencies of the propagating signal are rapidly absorbed. Another effect 

is the so called spherical divergence.

Considering the position of a wavefront at a certain time, it is possible to calculate its 

position at a later time by means of Huygen?s principle, which states that each point on the 

wavefront can be regarded as a new source point, from which a spherical wavefront 

propagates (McQuillin et al., 1984; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; Yilmaz, 2001a; Figure 

IV.29). 

 

Figure IV.29 – Schematic representation for the Huygen?s principle (McQuillin et al., 1984.). 

 

In a homogeneous medium, the wavefront from a point on the reflector will be spherical. 

As the wavefront expands, the energy of the disturbance is spread over a larger and 

larger area, so that the amplitude of the seismic wave decreases. This effect is called 

spherical divergence, and is the main reason why reflections from deep interfaces tend to 

have smaller amplitudes when compared with those from shallower areas (McQuillin et 

al., 1984). Spherical divergence causes the wave amplitude to decay as 1/r, where r is the 

radius of the wavefront.  

Other important factor which has major effects on a propagating wave field is absorption. 

This effect results in a change of frequency content of the initial source signal in a time-

variant manner, as it propagates through the subsurface. In order to attenuate this effect, 

Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is commonly used. Additionally, sometimes a gain function 

can be used to compensate for attenuation losses (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

In order to correct for the spherical divergence effect on this re-processing work a 

Spherical Divergence Correction was applied. This process increases the gain of the data 

using a spatially averaged velocity function with the time, compensating in this way the 

amplitude of deeper reflections. The Spherical Divergence Correction processing step 

was applied with the default parameterization, as it is showed in Figure IV.30. In addition, 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

83 
 

and to increase the amplitude content of the data in the deeper section a gain curve was 

build with an increase of 1dB per second. This function was applied to the seismic line 

already compensated for the spherical divergence, using the SPW process called Gain 

Function (Figure IV.31).

After these amplitudes corrections, improvements on the deeper reflections amplitudes 

are easily observed (Figure IV.32).

processing step. 

 

Single Channel Display 

As a quality control of the processing already performed, the data recorded on a single 

seismic channel was exported in order to quickly be opened on SeisViewer module for 

display.  

The seismic file previously created after the amplitude correction is now the input for a 

SPW General Trace Sort card. This process will allow exporting just the first channel 

using the following parameterization (Figure IV.33):

 – Field File – the input file is first sorted by the Field File number on each 

channel; a bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped and consists of one or

more adjacent locations sorted into the same output location; the bin interval is the 

number of locations to skip to reach the next location for output; 

2nd – Channel Number – select the channel desirable. In this case, Channel 1 was 

selected; a bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped and consists of one or 

more adjacent locations sorted into the same output location; the bin interval is the 

number of locations to skip to reach the next location for output.

The parameterization and the processing flow presented in Figure IV.33 Include a Normal 

Moveout correction with a constant velocity of 1500m/s. The Normal Moveout corrected 

data is then outputed as a seismic file, corresponding to the near traces (the data from all 

the shot recorded in the first channel) (Figure IV.34).

SuperGather and Velocity Analysis 

After the geometry definition, the filtering and the amplitude correction steps follow a 

velocity analysis is performed, which will be used for the stack and migration algorithms.  

Seismic data provides an indirect measurement of the velocity of the signal propagation 

throughout the subsurface, allowing the exploration geophysicist to derive a large number 

of different types of velocity: interval, apparent, average, root-mean-square (rms), 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

87 
 

instantaneous, phase, group, normal moveout (NMO), stacking and migration velocities 

(Yilmaz, 2001a).  

In terms of seismic processing the stacking velocity is the one that yields the best stack, it 

is approximately an rms velocity (Yilmaz, 2001a). Velocity estimation requires the data to 

be recorded at long offsets on common-midpoint (CMP) sections. With estimated 

velocities it is possible to correct for non-zero offset and compress the recorded data 

volume to a staked section.  

For a single constant-velocity horizontal reflector, the traveltime curve as a function of 

offset is a hyperbola centered at x=0. The time difference between traveltime at a given 

offset and at zero offset is called normal moveout (NMO). The velocity required to correct 

the normal moveout is called the normal moveout velocity. 

Conventional velocity analysis is based on the hyperbolic assumption. The hyperbolic 

traveltime equation is linear in the (t
2
 – x

2
) plane. Zero-offset time and the stacking velocity 

for a given reflector can be estimated from the straight line that best fits the traveltime 

picks plotted on the (t
2
) versus (x

2
) plane. Another way to pick velocities is using Constant 

Velocity Panels, using a range of constant velocity values, and chosing the velocity that 

best flattens each event (Hatten et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Another common velocity analysis technique is based on computing the velocity 

spectrum, or Semblance. The idea is to display some measurement of the signal 

coherency after stack for different velocities on a graph of velocity versus two-way zero-

offset time. Since its introduction by Taner and Koehler (1969), it has been an 

indispensable tool for velocity analysis of seismic records. The underlying principle is to 

compute the signal coherency on the CMP gather in small time gates that follows a 

hyperbolic trajectory. Stacking velocities are interpreted from velocity spectra by choosing 

the velocity function that produces the highest coherency. If data from all channels are 

perfectly coherent, or show continuity from trace to trace, the semblance has a value of a 

unity, at times with significant event amplitudes (Hatton et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 2001a). The 

Semblance is a velocity spectrum defined as a quantitative measure of the coherence of 

seismic data from multiple channels. It is equal to the energy of a stacked trace divided by 

the energy of all the traces that make up the stack. In this processing work, the 

Semblance was used to perform the velocity analysis,  

Normal moveout (NMO) velocity analysis using semblance spectra (Taner and Koehler, 

1969) is an important first step toward building a stacking and migration velocity model. 

The accuracy of the velocity model depends on the user?s ability to pick the correct 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

88 
 

velocity, which on the other hand also depends on the accuracy and resolution of the 

semblance spectrum itself.  

Velocity analysis involves a considerable number of calculations and hence it is fairly 

expensive to execute. Therefore, in order to reduce the costs and time of this operation, 

when the numbers of traces in a CMP gather is large, or when there is a large number of 

gathers, representative CMP locations are selected for velocity analysis. Depending on 

the total number of CMP gathers, the selected locations for velocity picking may be 

spaced by intervals of 20, 50 or 100. In this work selected CMP?s for velocity analysis 

were spaced every 50 CMP?s. 

Velocity analyzes are ordinarily picked by an interpreter and not automatically. Picking 

velocities involves selecting the time-velocity values to be used in subsequent processing. 

The velocity-analysis interpreter often has the main purpose of achieving a good stack, 

and stacking can often tolerate appreciable velocity errors. The interpreter is ordinarily 

guided by a set of simple rules (e.g. Yilmaz, 1987; Hatten et al., 1996; Sheriff and Geldart, 

1995): 

1. an increase in stacking velocity Vs with increasing depth is more probable than a 

decrease; 

2. in marine data, an interval velocity greater than 6700 m/s or less than 1430 m/s is 

unlikely; 

3. the difference in interval velocity for successive layers should exceed 2%; 

4. any event at about twice the t0 of a previous event and with approximately the 

same Vs is probably a multiple and should not be picked. Multiples will have 

velocities that are low and diffractions and sideswipe events are apt to have 

velocities that are unreasonably high. 

The accuracy and resolution of the stacking velocity values clearly depend on acquisition 

factors such as the receiver line length, the fold, the recorded bandwidth, the signal-to-

noise ratio, and the lack of near- or far-offset traces, as well as on the processing steps 

performed before the velocity analysis (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

The velocity model derived from the velocity analysis should be plotted at the same 

vertical scale as the seismic section so that they can be overlaid on the section. In this 

way, it is easier to identify stacking-velocity picks with specific events of interest, and this 

also allows that the same reflection events are picked at successive CMP Locations. 

Generally, as many events as possible should be picked, since picking many events often 

discloses important interpretation clues. 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey

Nowadays modern processing flows include velocity analysis processes that imply the 

creation of Super Gathers, instead of using regular CMP Gathers, Semblance grids and 

constant velocity stack panels. In SPW, there are two ways of building Super Gathers. 

The standard way is to use already established processes: Build Super Gathers process, 

linked to a SuperGather Velocity Analysis box, and with a Seismic File card as an output. 

This creates three different files: a Constant Velocity Panel, a SuperGather or a binned 

seismic gather, and a Semblance seismic grid.  

A Constant Velocity Panel is composed of short displays of CMP data (normally 5 to 25 

CMP?s; Hatton et al., 286) where each of the displays represent stacks made with different 

constant normal moveout velocities, that range from the lowest expected velocity to the 

highest one. The panel will show which velocities better correct the NMO effect for each 

seismic event on the different stacks created with different NMO velocities. 

A SuperGather is also a CMP gather but with the difference that is built by summing 

several consecutive CMP gathers. 

An alternative procedure, in SPW, consists in a sequence of header operations using the 

Trace Header Cell Math process in order to obtain just a seismic file which is then used as 

a Binned Gather (SuperGather) or Semblance at the same time. Since in this re-

processing process the Constant Velocity Panels were not used for velocity picking, and 

due to its robustness, the second alternative was used.  

The input file in this processing step is the amplitude corrected seismic file which is sorted 

by CMP first and then by Offset. The CMP sort was done by binning 8 consecutive CMP 

locations at intervals of 100 locations. Then these were sorted considering the entire 

range of offsets. 

After the CMP sorting, six header operations were performed, using the Trace Header 

Cell Math cards. The objective of these operations is to get a SuperGather with the 

maximum fold possible for each desirable CMP position (see explanation on Appendix A). 

The output seismic gathers, after the header manipulation are seismic files that can work 

both as a binned gather (the SuperGather), or as a semblance grid. In order, to build a 

reliable velocity model the picking velocities process should be done using both panels, 

the Super Gathers and the Semblance grid, a the same time (Figure IV.35). 

The velocity analysis is done in a combined display were the Super Gathers can be 

viewed side-by-side with the semblance spectrum. The semblance displays the velocities 

as contours of a measure of coherence (violet in Figure IV.35; which are the areas that 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

90 
 

should be picked to create the velocity model, since they corresponds to the best stacking 

velocities). 

 

Figure IV.35 – SuperGather and Semblance displayed in SeisViewer. 

 

In addition, in SPW, while the user is picking the velocities in the semblance panel the 

effect of the NMO correction with the picked velocity can be viewed in the CMP gather. In 

this way it is possible to adjust the velocities that better correct the reflection hyperbola 

(makes them horizontal). 

As best practice, is to use three different displays simultaneously, which can also be done 

in SPW (Figure IV.36): 

i) SuperGather;  

ii) Semblance grid spectrum;  

iii) Display of the velocity picks (the velocity model) on top of a stacked section.

IV.3.2.3 FLOW 2 - Test Stack  

The second processing flow is performed to obtain a stacked section and perform a 

quality check of the seismic processing done so far. At this stage, a stack of the seismic 

profile was produced to evaluate the geometry, filtering, statics corrections, amplitude 

recovery, and the velocity model created on the previous processing flow. 

To execute the stack of the seismic profiles it is necessary to apply the normal moveout 

correction and sum all the seismic traces in each CMP gather (the stacking process itself) 

into a final stacked section. The normal moveout effect is removed using the velocity 

model picked in the previous step.  

As already mentioned above, the energy reflected from a single interface arrives at the 

receivers at times which are dependent on the offset between the receivers and the 

sources. Corrections for these delays (NMO corrections) are made such that arrival times, 

from the same reflecting point in the same CMP gather, on each trace are the same, and 

are equal to the two-way travel time that would be observed if source and receiver were 

coincident, i.e. at zero-offset.  



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

93 
 

An undesirable side-effect of the NMO correction is the deformation of the wavelet caused 

by the NMO stretch effect on the larger offsets (Figure IV.38; Hatton et al., 1986). 

 

Figure IV.38 – Inherent distortion in moveout correction (modified from Hatton et al., 1986). 

 

Figure IV. 39 shows the simple case of a single horizontal layer. At a given midpoint 

location, M, the traveltime along the raypath from the shot position S, to the depth point D, 

and  back to the receiver position R is t(x). 

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the traveltime equation can be described by a hyperbola 

equation in the plane of two-way time versus offset (Equation 6): 

 

                     

 

where x is the distance (offset) between the source and receiver position, v is the velocity 

of the medium above the reflecting interface, and t(0) is twice the traveltime along the 

vertical path MD. Note that the vertical projection of point D to the surface, along the 

normal to the reflector, coincides with midpoint M, only for horizontal interfaces. 

Developing Equation 6 it is possible to compute the velocity when offset x and two-way 

times t(x) and t(0) are known (Equation 7). The difference between the two-way time at a 

given offset t(x) and the two-way zero-offset time t(0) is the Normal Moveout (Equation 7; 

Figure IV.40)

(Eq.7) 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey

The NMO correction 

The NMO corrections can produce three different results in the data: undercorrected, 

corrected or overcorrected events. Undercorrection occurs when a velocity higher that the 

supposed NMO velocity is used for the NMO correction. On the other hand, if a lower 

velocity is used, overcorrection occurs. The aimed corrected horizon is obtained by the 

use of the velocity that best flatten the target seismic event (Figure IV.41). 

All of these assumptions and principles are however only valid in the case of horizontal 

layers. The equations and the principles change when a more realistic model with several 

dipping-layers is considered. The dipping layers moveout can be corrected with the so 

called Dip Moveout process (explained further in the text – Flow 6). 

 

Figure IV.41 – NMO corrections: A) CMP gather containing a single event with a moveout velocity 
of 2260m/s; B) NMO-corrected gather using the appropriate moveout velocity; C) NMO-corrected 
gather using a low velocity – overcorrection effect; D) NMO-corrected gather using a high velocity - 
undercorrection effect (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). 

 

CMP Stack 

Common-midpoint stacking is the most important data-processing step in improving the 

imaging quality of the data. The principles involved have already been shortly discussed 

along with the field procedures used to acquire the data (multicoverage acquisition). The 

traces within a common-midpoint gather are summed, along horizontal NMO-corrected 

seismic events, to yield a single stacked trace. A CMP stacked section is often regarded 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

96 
 

as a zero-offset section, especially after migration is performed on the data (Yilmaz, 

2001a).  

The stacking of a seismic section severely increases the overall signal-to-noise ratio and 

attenuates most multiples. Common-midpoint stacking ordinarily assumes that all traces in 

the gather being stacked have equal validity and thus should be given equal weight. The 

output amplitude is divided by the number of live traces which were summed during the 

stack, that is, adjustments are made for muted and occasional missing or dead traces 

(Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). Other options, as weighted stacking are also possible in most 

processing software packages. 

In the case of the processing shown here, the velocities analysis previously performed for 

each seismic event of interest, was recorded into a SPW Velocity Card, and applied for 

the NMO corrections at each CMP. Combining a sequence of common-midpoint gathers 

after NMO correction yields a common-midpoint stack. 

The created SPW flow for the CMP Stack is composed of: an input seismic file, linked to 

the Apply Normal Moveout process, which has also a the previously created Velocity Card 

as input. The output seismic file is the Stack Seismic File itself (Figure IV.42; Figure 

IV.43).

Figure IV.43 – Stack processing in the SPW Flowchart. The constant velocity of 1500m/s on the 
Apply Normal Moveout card is ignored due to the fact that there is a Velocity Picks Card input. 
Instead velocities in this Velocity Picks Card will be used (rms velocities). 

 

As a quality check step, before the CMP Stack, a simple header manipulation with the 

Trace Header Cell Math tool was performed. This manipulation step writes directly on the 

seismic file a user-defined number on the Survey ID column. Having different seismic files 

with different numbers of Survey ID allows the application of a Merge Seismic process 

which will merge up to 4 different seismic files (Figure IV.44). This output can then be 

displayed on SeisViewer, and changing the Survey ID number can be very helpful to 

quickly compare non-processed with processed seismic sections, or even compare the 

same processing step with different parameterizations.

Complete Flow 

The complete flow, 2–Test Stack, is composed of: a constant velocity stack, a stack with a 

velocity model from velocity analysis, and a Seismic Merge to compare the results from 

the different seismic processing steps(Figure IV.45). This Flow 2 will be later used during 

processing, to check the quality and consistency of the processing flow.

One example of CMP Stacks from one seismic line processed in the scope of this thesis is 

shown in Figure IV.46. 

 

IV.3.2.4 FLOW 3 - Deconvolution 

Deconvolution is a process that, if well parameterized improves the temporal resolution of 

seismic data by compressing the seismic wavelet. Deconvolution can be applied before 

and/or after stack (Yilmaz, 2001a). Besides the wavelet compression, the deconvolution 

process can significantly remove part of the source-receiver ghost and the seafloor 

multiple energy from the section, particularly when using predictive deconvolution. 

However, this multiple attenuation is not always efficient. 

On the recorded seismic trace, the acoustic impedance contrast between sucessive layers 

causes the reflections that are recorded along a subsurface profile. Thus, the recorded 

seismogram can be modeled as a convolution of the Earth?s impulse response with the 

seismic wavelet, generated by the seismic source. The Earth?s impulse response 

comprises primary reflections (reflectivity series) and all possible multiples created during 

the seismic energy propagation inside the Earth. This impulse response is

what would be recorded if the generated seismic wavelet was just a spike. Ideally, 

deconvolution should compress the wavelet components and in this way eliminate 

multiples, leaving the intrinsic Earth?s reflectivity in the seismic record (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

To explain the Deconvolution process a brief description of the convolution model is 

introduce. As already stated before, the seismic records are generated by the convolution 

of the seismic wavelet with the Earth?s reflectivity series. If there were no noise, the 

seismic section will be formed of simple reflections at each geological boundary between 

layers with different physical properties (density and velocity). This linear process is called 

the Principle of Superposition (Yilmaz, 2001a; Figure IV.47). 

 

Figure IV.47 – Convolution model; synthetic seismogram. A wavelet travelling in the Earth repeats 
itself when it encounters a reflector along its path (b,c,d,e,f). The left column represents the 
reflections coefficients, while the right column represents the response of the wavelet. Amplitudes 
of the response are scaled by the reflection coefficient. The resulting seismogram (bottom right) 
represents the composite response of the Earth?s reflectivity (bottom left) to the wavelet (in Yilmaz, 
1987). 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

101 
 

This theoretical assumption is not achievable in real situations, and the seismic traces will 

be composed of reflections from each interface and by noise (environmental noise, noise 

from the equipments, and acquisition conditions, etc., Equation 8). Depending on the 

frequency of the seismic wavelet and the spacing between interfaces, the seismic record 

may be affected also by interference effects. A more realistic representation of a record 

seismogram is shown in Figure IV.48. 

 

Figure IV.48 – The recorded seismogram (bottom image) is the sum of the noise-free seismogram 

and noise (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). 

 

The parameters of the Convolution Model are described by (Equation 8): 

 

                     (Eq.8) 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia

where x(t) is the recorded seismogram, w(t) is the basic seismic wavelet, e(t) is the 

Earth?s impulse response, n(t) random ambient noise, and   denotes the convolution 

operator. 

In order to better image closely spaced reflecting boundaries (thin layering), the source 

waveform must be compressed to obtain the desired sparse spike series (the reflectivity 

series; Yilmaz, 2001a). This removal process is just the opposite of the convolution 

process, and therefore referred to as deconvolution. Deconvolution tries to recover the 

reflectivity series, i.e. the impulse response from the subsurface, from the recorded 

seismogram (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

The original source waveform w(t) is normally not totally known. However, in certain cases 

the source wavelet may be partly known by deploying seismic receivers the closest 

possible to the source. Nevertheless, what is measured is only the waveform at the 

source point and not the wavelet that is recorded at the receiver, which is considerably 

different due to the low-pass filter character of the Earth?s subsurface. In addition, another 

drawback is the lack of a priori knowledge of the ambient noise, n(t) (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

Over the years, deconvolution has become an effective method to increase temporal 

resolution, in spite of the difficulties discussed. To solve for the unknown e(t) in equation 

8, the noise component must be assumed to be zero, and an approximate waveform is 

assumed. Due to these assumptions the convolutional and the deconvolution models 

have to be dealt in time and frequency domains. If the source waveform is known, then 

the solution to the deconvolution problem is deterministic and we use inverse filtering to 

find the Earth response. If the source waveform is unknown (the usual case), then the 

solution to the deconvolution problem is statistical or predictive, and we usually use 

predictive deconvolution to find the Earth response. The Wiener prediction
4
 theory 

provides a good and satisfactory method for statistical deconvolution (for further details 

Yilmaz, 2001a). 

The deconvolution process used in this work was a Predictive. Therefore, this will be the 

only method which will be further described in the scope of this thesis (for further 

information see Yilmaz, 2001a; Chapter 2 - 83-152pp). 

As mentioned before, in a seismic record, what is usually know is the seismic trace x(t), 

and although the source wavelet is usually unknown, the seismogram-wavelet relation can

be used to compute a scaled version of it and used during the processing of the data 

instead. The desired output of a Deconvolution is the Earth?s response e(t), which is 

unknown because of its random nature. For these reasons, it is not possible to use normal 

equations (as the one shown in equation 8) directly; however, we can still use them if we 

require the desired output to be a time-advanced version x (t+ ?) of the input x(t), where ? 

is called the prediction lag, which can be easily calculated (Robinson and Treitel, 1980; 

Yilmaz, 2001a). 

In practice, to apply a Predictive Deconvolution it is necessary to set-up a set of 

parameters such as: the operator length, the prediction lag, and the pre-whitening factor. 

This selection is highly dependent on the characteristics of the autocorrelation of the 

seismic traces. Therefore, it is important to run an autocorrelation of the data to choose 

the suitable autocorrelation window (gate). This autocorrelation step is then used to define 

the deconvolution parameters. The autocorrelation window should include the part of the 

record that contains useful reflection signal and should exclude coherent (e. g., ground 

roll) or incoherent noise (e. g., later parts of the record). Its length should also be about 

eight to ten times the largest operator length that will be used on the Deconvolution 

process (Yilmaz, 2001a) 

A Predictive Deconvolution, using a prediction filter with length n and prediction lag ?, 

converts a given source wavelet of length (n+?) into another wavelet that is ? samples 

longer. Depending on ?, the Deconvolution can be spiking or predictive. For spiking 

deconvolution ? is equal to 1, and for a predictive deconvolution the prediction lags ? is 

greater than 1. This last method is better applied to predict and suppress multiples or 

ghosts. If the prediction lag is increased, the output from the predictive deconvolution 

becomes less spiky, because the amplitude spectrum becomes more band-limited and 

with less bandwidth. Applying a band-pass filter after a deconvolution is not the equivalent 

of a predictive deconvolution with ? &gt; 1. The use of spiking deconvolution should be 

limited, since it may boost high-frequency noise in the data. 

In the case of using a predictive Deconvolution (? &gt; 1) for multiple suppressing, the 

selection of ? depends on the type of multiple:  

? Long-path multiples: ? should be selected equal to the beginning of first multiple 

on the autocorrelogram; 

? Short-path multiples: ? should be selected equal to the first or second zero 

crossing on the autocorrelogram (In the processing work presented on this thesis, 

the second zero of the autocorrelation function was chosen).

The amplitude spectrum of the spiking deconvolution operator (inverse filter) is 

approximately the reciprocal of that of the source wavelet. If the amplitude spectrum of the 

source wavelet had zeros, then the amplitude spectrum of the inverse filter will be 

unstable (i. e., it will be infinite at these points). To ensure numerical stability, an artificial 

level of random (white) noise is added before the Deconvolution process itself. This 

process is called prewhitening and is achieved by adding white noise, with a very small 

variance, to the amplitude spectrum of the source wavelet (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

Under the scope of this work, a Predictive Deconvolution was applied to the seismic data 

in order to increase the vertical resolution of the data, to attenuate the waterbottom 

multiple, and also to attenuate the ghost that is present on shallower part of the seismic 

profiles (this effect was already described in Figure IV.46). 

In the SPW, the Deconvolution process there is the possibility to apply a spiking or 

predictive deconvolution to the data. It is also possible to define the percentage of pre-

whitening, the filter length, the number of operators, the overlap of the operator design 

windows, the start time of the first operator design window, and the design window 

lengths. For the predictive deconvolution method, we must specify the predictive length of 

the wavelet. The SPW Deconvolution process card is shown in Figure IV.49. 

 

Figure IV.49 – Parameters used in the Deconvolution process  

 

Waterbottom Picking 

To perform the Predictive Deconvolution for the attenuation of the waterbottom multiple, 

the time corresponding to the seafloor was picked as a horizon and used as the input for 

the Deconvolution process, acting as a prediction horizon. This picking was performed on 

a stacked seismic section, using the SeisViewer application (Figure IV.50).

Decon-Guide Picking 

To define the start time of the deconvolution operator, a Decon-Guide window was picked 

at every Source Location, for each channel of the record. The Decon-Guide window must 

be picked a few ms above the seafloor, and visually will act as an Early Mute (Figure 

IV.51).

Predictive Deconvolution with the Waterbottom 

Both the Waterbottom Picks and the Decon-Guide Picks cards were linked to the 

Deconvolution processing, in order to tackle the seabottom multiple (Figure IV.52). 

As shown in Figure IV.56, Auo In order to remove the ghost, another Predictive 

Deconvolution was performed, using this time a prediction length calculated from the 

Autocorrelation Function, instead of using the seabottom picks as a predictive horizon.

Predictive Deconvolution using the Autocorrelation Function 

The autocorrelation functions of several seismic traces were calculated using the SPW 

VectorCalculator module for the design of the deconvolution operators. The average time 

value for the second autocorrelation zero was then used as the Deconvolution prediction 

length for de-signature, i.e. wavelet signature compression. An example of an 

autocorrelation function of a random seismic trace is shown in Figure IV.53.

zero of the autocorrelation function was used as prediction length. 

 

To tackle the source ghost artifact, originated by a source gun desynchronization, the 

Decon-Guide, previously picked was linked to the Deconvolution process (Figure IV.54), 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia

to set the design window start, since the prediction length was given by the second zero of 

the autocorrelation function (Figure IV.54). 

 

Figure IV.54 – Predictive Deconvolution processing applied to seismic line GB-10b using the 

Autocorrelation function. 

 

As it is possible to see in Figure IV.57 this second Predictive Deconvolution process 

totally suppresses the ghost effect allowing the imaging of some seismic events which 

were masked by this artifact.

The complete flow 3 – Deconvolution is shown in Figure IV.55. The stack of the output 

seismic files was performed in order to control the quality of the deconvolution process 

and its results.

IV.3.2.5 FLOW 4 - Common-midpoint Sort 

After the final deconvolved seismic file is obtained, the processing job proceeds with a 

common-midpoint sort (CMP Sort). 

The collection of the traces recorded from source-receiver pairs that have the same 

common midpoint (CMP) is called a common midpoint or CMP gather. As already 

mentioned before, each CMP location is located half the horizontal distance between the 

source and the receiver (considering that the source and the receiver are at the same 

depth). If multiple sources and receivers are used and the spacing between the sources 

and receivers is set-up correctly, more than one source receiver pair will have the same 

midpoint. This means that several reflections are obtained from the same subsurface 

reflection location and the acquisition is considered has therefore multifold coverage. 

The CMP Sort processing step converts seismic files ordered by shot point location (shot 

gather) into seismic files sorted by common midpoint locations (CMP gather). A shot 

gather has all stations that recorded a single shot and a common midpoint gather has all 

the shot-receiver pairs that have the same midpoint location. 

For this purpose, in SPW FlowChart a General Trace Sort step was used, which allows 

the sorting of the input seismic traces according to primary, secondary, and optional 

tertiary keys. In this case, the key words correspond to the trace header fields (Figure 

IV.58). 

 

Figure IV.58 – CMP Sort using a General Trace Sort step. 

 

The Primary Sort Key controls the sort type of the output records. The Secondary Sort 

Key controls the sort type of the traces of these output records. These two sort keys are 

mandatory. The Tertiary Sort Key is optional and controls sorting of duplicate trace types 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

111 
 

such as two traces in a CMP bin at identical offsets. For each sort key, the bin interval and 

bin size are customized. A bin defines how the sorted data type is grouped. A bin size can 

be as small as one or include many traces. The bin interval is the number of locations to 

skip to reach the next location for output. The range limits allows limiting the location in 

the output to the specific range of location required for further analysis and processing. 

This CMP Sort processing step was applied to the previuous deconvolved seismic file, in 

order to sort the seismic data by CMP location, to be used on the next processing steps. 

  The complete processing flow is presented in Figure IV.59. 

 

Figure IV.59 – SPW processing flow 4 – CMP Sort. 

 

IV.3.2.6 FLOW 5 - Radon DeMultiple  

The main multiple attenuation methods are commonly divided in two categories: (1) 

methods that predict the multiples from the data itself, and (2) those that recur to moveout 

separation between multiples and primaries seismic events. Among the first group of 

techniques are those methods denominated as surface related multiple elimination 

(SRME), wave-field extrapolation, and predictive deconvolution. On the other hand, 

moveout methods are those based on F-K or Radon transforms. Both categories have 

their own very different set of strengths and weaknesses.  

As advantages of this methods they are methods relatively cheap and reliable, and can do 

an excellent job of discriminating between primaries and multiples seismic events in cases 

where certain assumptions are satisfied. However, they require an intensive computation, 

and for those cases where the theoretical assumptions are not satisfied these methods 

have an unstable behavior. As a workaround for the methods? limitations different 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

112 
 

demultiple techniques are sometimes cascaded in the processing sequence to address 

the widest possible range of multiple issues. 

Demultiple techniques based on moveout differences usually involve a transformation of 

the data to some other domain different from the time-space one, enabling the clear and 

natural separation of the primary and multiple seismic events. In the transform domain the 

primaries can be muted and the multiples transformed back to the time-space domain and 

be subtracted from the input data. The most popular transform for this purpose is the 

Radon Transform (e.g. Hampson and Dunham, 1985; Hampson, 1987; Yilmaz, 1988; 

Hargreaves et al., 2001; PGS, 2008) 

In its conventional form the Radon transform is used to model pre-stack data as a set of 

parabolic events which best fit the data in a least-squares sense (Hampson, 1986). 

Unfortunately, the conventional Radon transform has some limitations related to its spatial 

aperture and spatial sampling which can cause mis-focusing of energy in the transform 

domain.  

The simplest Radon transform is computed by summing the data in the space-time 

domain along straight lines with a range of dips, and then mapping the results onto a grid 

of intercept time, ?, and time dip, p. This linear Radon transform is sometimes called a 

slant stack (Figure IV.60).  

 

Figure IV.60 – Several different arrivals (A, B, C and D) on a CMP gather (left image, t-x domain) 

mapped onto the corresponding ?- p gather (A?, B?, C? and D?) (modified from Yilmaz, 1987). 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

113 
 

As shown on Figure IV.61 the left image schemes give a basic illustration for original data 

in the time-offset domain (t-x). The parameters used to define the family of lines determine 

the dimensions of the transform space. This implies a dip-intercept transform domain (?-?) 

as shown on the right hand side. The three represented events in the t-x domain are 

transformed into three points in the ?- p space. 

In the Radon domain, multiples can be removed by muting those parabolas that represent 

the multiple curvatures. 

 

 

Figure IV.61 - Schematic representation of mapping seismic events in the t-x domain to positions 
in Radon domain: a) represents the linear transform; b) illustrates the parabolic transform. In both 
case seismic data in t-x is summed along the shown trajectories, and the output result is the 
corresponding positions in the Radon domain (modified from PGS, 2008). 

 

An alternative to the standard decomposition is the high-resolution Radon transform 

(Sacchi and Ulrych, 1995). This overcomes the limitations of the standard algorithm by 

constraining the algorithm so that it departs from the standard least-squares solution. 

Instead, it performs a sparse decomposition of the input and represents the data by fewer 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

114 
 

events in the Radon domain. The high-resolution Radon Transform can be applied on the 

frequency domain or in the time domain (Hargreaves et al., 2001; PGS, 2008). 

 

Application of Radon Demultiple 

The Radon demultiple technique was applied to tackle the seabottom multiple, since the 

Predictive Deconvolution was unsuccessful on this task. The SPW Radon Demultiple 

processing step performs a parabolic radon demultiple through modeling of the multiples 

in the parabolic radon domain. The modeled multiple reflections are then subtracted from 

the original data in the time domain.  

In SPW, the Radon Demultiple processing step must be set-up in terms of transform type, 

the range of ray parameters in the output transform, and the spatial and temporal taper 

lengths (Figure IV.62).  

 

Figure IV.62 – Radon Demultiple processing card. 

 

On this processing step it is required to sort the data into an offset-ordered, to have a 

offset-ordered seismic output file. This sort may be done recurring to header manipulation 

using the SPW process called Trace Headers Column Math and Trace Header Cell Math 

(see Appendix). The header operations will create a seismic data with one offset gather 

for each CMP Location, in order to increase the resolution in each CMP Location. The 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

115 
 

Radon Demultiple is always preceded by a NMO correction (red dotted box in Figure 

IV.63). The complete Radon Demultiple processing flow is shown in Figure IV.63. 

 

Figure IV.63  – Radon Demultiple processing flow. The header operation performed by the various 
Trace Header Cell Math steps are described in detail in the Appendix. 

 

Tail Mute 

To complement the imaging enhancement provided by the Radon Demultiple a tail mute 

was applied to the data in order to attenuate the strong remaining multiple energy. 

The SPW Tail Mute process is a normal mute, which zeroes the amplitudes of the 

selected traces within a user-defined area. The resulting Tail Mute picks file card is 

applied to the output seismic file of the Radon Demultiple, process (Figure IV.64). The 

picked mute will zeroe the amplitudes of the first arrivals for the near traces below the first 

seabed multiple in the Radon Demultiple output gathers (Figure IV.64a). To identify the 

remaining hyperbola that corresponds to the multiple, a stacked seismic section of the 

Radon Demultiple output can be displayed side by side with the previous window 

mentioned (Figure IV.64b).

Figure IV.65 – Tail Mute processing flow. 

 

The tail mute improves the attenuation of the seabottom multiple by reducing the energy 

content from the first arrivals of the near traces at time depths below the multiple (Figure 

IV.66).  

A stacked seismic section conveniently processed with a Radon Demultiple and improved 

with a Tail Mute is shown in Figure IV.66. In this figure, it is clearly observed the 

significant improvement in the attenuation of the seabottom multiple. The Radon 

Demultiple is an essential process to attenuate the unwanted multiple energy in the 

bottom part of the seismic section, to perform correctly the pre-stack time migration. 

 

Complete Flow 

The main aim of this data processing flow is the attenuation of the seabottom multiple 

which was not achieved with the Predictive Deconvolution. Combining the Radon 

Demultiple with a Tail Mute, the seabottom multiple energy was successfully attenuated. 

The final seismic processing Flow 5 is presented in Figure IV.67. 

 

IV.3.2.7 FLOW 6 - Pre-Stack Time Migration 

The final result of the processing operations is normally a zero-offset seismic time section. 

Conventional stacked sections represent a zero-offset seismic time section where each 

seismic trace is plotted vertically below the source-receiver position regardless of the true 

position and dip of the reflecting interface (Hatton et al., 1986;Yilmaz, 2001a). In order to 

obtain the true position of each reflection, a process called migration needs to be applied 

to the data. .

Seismic Migration 

Seismic migration is the procedure by which an image of the correctly positioned 

subsurface reflecting interfaces is obtained from a seismic time section Correctly 

implemented, it is a transform from the unmigrated time domain to the migrated time or 

depth domain. In this sense, “migrated” is synonymous of “correctly positioned”, although 

in practice, it should be interpreted simply as “re-positioned”. The most important 

parameter in the migration process is to estimate a reliable migration velocity model at all 

subsurface positions v(x, y, z;) (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

In areas of steep dip, reflector segments appear on the time section with a considerable 

offset from their true position (Figure IV.68a). In a non-migrated zero-offset seismic 

section, the reflection received at X may come from an oblique point A, but is plotted 

vertically below X at C, where in two-way time XC = XA (Figure IV.68a). In a non-migrated 

section reflectors are moved downdip from their real position, and show a smaller dip than 

they actually have. More complex geometries arise when the reflector curvature exceeds 

that of the incident wavefront (Figure IV.68b). Reflections received at the same surface 

location can be originated by more than one reflection point at the subsurface (see 

Chapter III – Horizontal Resolution). Migration moves dipping reflections to their true 

subsurface positions and collapses diffractions, resulting from energy scattering in sharp 

edges (e.g. faults; see Figure IV.69). Note that migration does not displace horizontal 

events; rather, it moves dipping events in the updip direction and collapses diffractions, 

increasing the  spatial resolution of the subsurface imaging in particular in fault zones. 

 

Figure IV.68 – a) Actual event AB is recorded in a apparent location CD; b) reflections from a 

concave reflector; rays from each of the source location (1-10) are reflected from up to three 

different points on the concave reflector, the bottom diagram shows a complex pattern of three 

reflector curves, commonly know as a “bow-tie”, typical of sinclines (modified from McQuillin et al., 

1984). 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

121 
 

As mentioned before, a concave-upward reflector on the seismic data produces the 

focusing of the seismic wave and originates three reflection points on the folded event per 

surface location (Figure IV.68). This type of geological features normally produces 

artifacts in non-migrates seismic section, commonly denominated as bow ties. The 

migration corrects this effect and properly re-positioning the seismic events to their real 

position (Sheriff, 1991) (Figure IV.68; Figure IV.69). 

 

Figure IV.69  – Migration corrections on synthetic models: a) original synthetic section; b) migrated 

section (modified McQuillin et al., 1984) 

 

The goal of the migration is therefore to convert a stacked section into something more 

similar to a geologic cross-section, where every geologic event is placed in its correct 

location (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

The migration process that produces a migrated time section is called Time Migration, and 

it is appropriate as long as the computed lateral velocity variations are smooth. When 

there are important lateral velocity gradients, time migration does not produce a proper 

subsurface image and instead it is necessary to perform a depth migration, with ray trace 

modeling. In that, the output is a depth section (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

When migrating a seismic section, two undesirable effects may happen: overmigration 

and undermigration. The overmigration is the result of inadequate use of higher seismic 

velocities than the correct ones. On the contrary, undermigrated events occur when lower 

velocities than the corrected ones are used for this migration. 

There are different types of migration algorithms available by computing filters operating 

across many traces: 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

122 
 

a) Algorithms based on differential methods: finite difference techniques 

implemented in t – x and f-x domains; 

b) Algorithms implemented in the FK domain: FK and Phase shift migration 

methods; 

c) Algorithms based on integral methods: Kirchhoff method. 

 

The first common migration technique was the semicircle superposition method that was 

used before the digital era. Then this migration algoritm was replaced by the diffraction-

summation technique which is based on summing the seismic amplitudes along a 

diffraction hyperbola whose curvature is governed by the medium velocity. The Kirchhoff 

summation technique was introduced later (Schneider, 1978) and basically is the same 

principle applied in the diffraction summation technique improved with both corrections for 

amplitudes and phase before the summation of the data data. These corrections make the 

summation consistent with the wave equation since they account for the spherical 

spreading, the obliquity factor (angle-dependency of amplitudes), and the phase shift 

inherent to Huygen?s secondary source. Another migration technique is based on the idea 

that a stacked section can be modeled as an upcoming zero-offset wave field generated 

by exploding reflectors (Claerbout and Doherty, 1972). Using that model, migration can be 

conceptualized as consisting of a wave field extrapolation (in the form of downward 

acoustic field continuation) followed by imaging (for further detail see X, 2001 – Chapter 

4). Downward continuation of wavefields can be implemented conveniently using finite-

difference solutions to the scalar wave equation. Migration methods based on such 

implementations are called finite-difference migration. Claerbout (1985) has provided a 

comprehensive theoretical foundation of finite-difference migration and its practical 

aspects. After the developments on Kirchhoff summation and finite-diference migrations, 

Stolt (1978) introduced migration by Fourier transform. The Stolt method is based on a 

constant-velocity assumption; however, Stolt modified his method to handle the types of 

velocity for which time migration is acceptable by stretching the time axis to account for 

velocity variations. Another frequency-wave number migration is the phase-shift method 

(Gazdag, 1978). This method is based on the idea that downward continuation amounts to 

a phase shift in the frequency-wavenumber domain (Yilmaz, 2001a). For further details on 

these and other migration algorithms please refer to Yillmaz (2001a). 

The migration algorthims can be applied after stack, in which casa they are called post-

stack migration; they can also be applied before the stack in pre-stack migration. However 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

123 
 

some algorithms give better results when applied in pre- or post-stack data, as further 

discussed in this text. Regardless of the migration algorithm used, the interpretability of a 

migrated section is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio, on the velocities used in 

migration, and on the quality of the stacked section (when we are dealing with post-stack 

data; Yilmaz, 2001a). 

 

Dip Moveout Correction 

Dip-Moveout (DMO) correction is applied to normal-moveout corrected pre-stack data to 

resolve conflicting dips with different stacking velocities during stacking. As a result, DMO 

correction yields an improved stacked section that is a closer representation of a zero-

offset section compared to a conventional CMP stack based only on a normal-moveout 

correction. A dip moveout corrected section better mimics the assumptions of zero-offset 

that are implicit in a migration of a seismic section (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

The difference in the arrival times, measured by receivers at two different offset locations, 

of a reflected wave in a dipping plan is called the Dip-Moveout effect (Figure IV.70). 

 

Figure IV.70 – DMO moves the data to the correct zero-offset trace for a dipping reflection after the 

reflection position has been corrected for the Normal Moveout effect; migration moves it to the 

subsurface location (in Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

In a dipping interface, the trace of a CMP gather does not corresponds to a true common 

reflection midpoint, resulting in a smearing of the received energy. The Dip-Moveout 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

124 
 

correction is a seismic processing operation that corrects the dipping effect of the 

reflector. DMO processing was developed in the early 1980s, and since that, several 

advances to dip moveout were performed (Hale and Artley, 1993; Liner and Lines, 1994; 

Wang, 1995). 

While conventional normal-moveout correction involves only a time shift, dip-moveout 

correction involves mapping in both the time and the space. This means that dip-moveout 

correction, in a strictly way, is not a moveout correction in conventional terms; rather, it is 

a process of partial migration applied to common-offset data. In fact, this process maps 

the nonzero-offset data to the plane of zero-offset. The DMO corrected section is then 

fully migrated using a zero-offset migration operator (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

In SPW the Dip Moveout processing step is applied as an integral DMO correction as 

described by X (see X, 2001, „Seismic Data Analysis?, pp.655-835). This is a summation 

operator applied to each source-receiver pair. There are no assumptions about regular 

geometry and the correction can be applied to irregularly spaced CMP gathers. This step 

operates on common offset gathers for calculating dip-related NMO corrections. The time 

(in milliseconds) that corresponds to a reflection of interest for dip moveout correction, 

must be inserted. The algorithm pads the data volume on the order of four times the trace 

length and width in order to ensure the stability of the algorithm. This SPW?s routine needs 

for input an offset-ordered seismic file (Figure IV.71). 

 

Figure IV.71 – Dip Moveout processing flow. The input is the Radon Demultiple output; the Trace 

Header Column Math is applied to load the original offset values (in the previous flow they were 

changed and the copy of the original was stored on the header file User Def 2). 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

125 
 

At this processing stage, the DMO process, was applied to remove the moveout effects 

more effectively than just using a regular NMO correction. The output of this processing 

step is an improved Semblance spectrum. Getting a quality Semblance spectrum is 

essential to perform a detailed velocity analysis to be used for the next processing step, 

the Migration (Figure IV.72). 

 

Figure IV.72 – Semblance spectrum before (left image) and after (right image) the Dip Moveout 

correction. The black dotted boxes represent areas where the improvement of the semblance 

resolution is clear. 

 

At this stage, as the DMO correction, as indeed improved the Semblance, it is advised to 

rebuilt the velocity model by redo the velocity analysis. This new velocity pick will provide 

a new and accurate velocity model, which will allow a better migration processing. 

 

Pre-Stack Phase-Shift Time Migration 

The pre-stack migration has the same principles as a post-stack migration. However the 

migration algorithm is applied in each CMP gather and not in just each CMP location. It is 

therefore a more time- and computational consumer processing, but it allows, in most of 

the cases, better results, particularly for the deeper positions of the seismic sections. 

In this processing work, in order to get results in a shorter time, a computer cluster 

created in 2009 at the Geology and Geophysics Laboratory from the University of Aveiro 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

126 
 

(Gandarinho, 2009) was used. This Cluster allowed doing the seismic processing in a 

considerable shorter time; in particular, it was very useful in heavy processing jobs, such 

as Radon Demultiple and Pre-Stack Migration. 

To perform the pre-stack migration the Phase-Shift migration algorithm was chosen as the 

algorithm which gives better results on this dataset. The theory of the frequency-number (f 

– k) migration techniques can be consulted in Yilmaz (2001a) (Section D.7). For this 

purpose, a briefly review of the f-k migration algorithm is presented (Yilmaz, 2001a): 

i) Like any other migration algorithm, it starts with the scalar wave equation; 

ii) Constant velocities are assumed constant and perform 3D Fourier transform 

and obtain the dispersion relation between the transforms variables; 

iii) Then, the dispersion relations are adopted to the exploding reflectors model by 

having the velocity for the upcoming waves; 

iv) Operate on the pressure wavefield P and do the inverse transform in z to 

obtain the differential equation; 

v) Obtain a solution. 

 

The discrete form of this solution is the basis for phase-shift migration in which velocity 

can be varied at each depth step in the vertical direction. The phase-shift method 

(Gazdag, 1978) can only handle vertically varying velocities. A way to accommodate 

lateral velocity variations judged to be acceptable is to first stretch the the CMP gather in 

the time direction so as to make it correspond to a velocity field v(z) that only varies 

vertically (Yilmaz, 2001a). This velocity field is associated with the unstretched CMP-

stacked section in the x direction. Following the stretching operation, the stacked section 

is migrated using the velocity function v(z) in the standard phase-shift migration scheme. 

Finally the migrated section is unstretched (Gazdag, 1978; Yilmaz, 2001a). The Gazdag?s 

FlowChart for a phase-shit migration is presented in Figure IV.73. 

In this seismic processing work the phase-shift algorithm was chose to perform the pre-

stack time migration of the seismic lines. However, other algorithms were tested too. For 

example, the Stolt method (Stolt, 1978) was also used, but yielded poorer results. A 

Velocity Card with the velocity model loaded was linked to both migration methods.  

The Stolt migration, the first to be tested due to its faster algorithm, needs rms velocities, 

or in other words, the velocities that are originally picked.

Figure IV.73  – Gazdag?s flow for a Phase-Shift Migration processing (in X, 2001a). 

 

For instance, the velocity card which was used for the NMO correction can directly be 

used to provide velocity information to the Stolt algorithm. The phase-shift migration does 

not work with rms velocities. Interval velocities are required to perform a good migration 

with this algorithm. As such, the Dix?s Equation to convert the rms velocities into interval 

velocities, vint, was used. The Dix?s Equation (Dix, 1955) states that (Equation 9): 

 

       
  

         
     

       
 

 

where vn and vn-1 are the rms velocities at the layer boundaries n and n-1, respectively; 

and tn and tn-1 are the horizon times at these layer boundaries. Vint refers to the interval 

velocities. 

In SPW the Dix’s Equation step will convert the rms velocity function card into a interval 

velocity card. The new velocity card can be use as the input into a Phase-Shift migration 

process. This conversion can be easily and quickly performed in the SPW FlowChart 

(Figure IV.74) 

(Eq. 9)

The processing flow for both migrations is shown in Figure IV.75 and in Figure IV.76. With 

the same velocity model, pre-stack phase-shift migration always gave better results than 

Stolt?s algorithm. Therefore, in spite of more time consuming, the Phase-Shift migration 

algorithm was always used in this work, due to its better results.

In order to produce the final migrated section a stack needs then to be computed. For this 

purpose, as the NMO and DMO were already corrected, a simple CMP sort card linked to 

a Seismic Stack Output, followed by a stack step is the flow required to stack correctly the 

seismic section (Figure IV.77).

IV.3.2.8 FLOW 7 - Post-Stack Time Migration 

A post-stack time migration was also performed during the data processing work. This will 

allow to compare the both time migrations (pre- and post-stack) and will allow to improve 

the resolution of the seismic events on the upper part of the seismc sections, in particular 

the faults.The Radon Demultiple seismic file output was stacked and a Kirkchhoff post-

stack migration algorithm was applied. 

 

Kirkchhoff Migration 

Kirchhoff migration is a non recursive method of seismic migration that uses the integral 

form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. The Kirchhoff migration method uses the 

same geometric and seismic wave-front principles as the diffraction summation method. 

The Kirchhoff method considers the origin of the diffraction curve (apex) to be the location 

of the true point reflector. This method is based on Huygens?s Principle, according to 

which, the seismic reflector is viewed as if it is composed of closely spaced point 

diffractions (Claerbout, 1985; Yilmaz, 2001a). The migration of a seismic section is 

achieved by collapsing each diffraction hyperbola to its (apex) and each point on the 

migrated section is treated independently from the other points. Each point on the output 

migrated section is produced by adding all data values along a diffraction that is centered 

at that point. The Kirchhoff migration corrects the amplitudes and phase for three factors 

before summing (Yilmaz, 2001a). First, the method corrects for the angle at which each 

event arrives at each receiver. The energy from a point reflector arrives at the receivers at 

different angles. This phenomenon is called the obliquity factor. When the energy arrives 

at the surface, the receivers near the point of image ray arrival record greater amplitude 

than those receivers located at some distance from this location. Before the summation, 

an obliquity, or directivity, correction factor to the amplitudes is therefore applied (Yilmaz, 

2001a). The second correction is the spherical divergence, or spreading factor, already 

explained before. The third factor in the Kirchhoff migration method is a correction to 

restore amplitude and phase from distortions that occur during wavefront propagation. 

This correction is called the wave shaping factor. In Kirchhoff migration, the back 

propagation (or continuation) of the seismic wave field from the region where it was 

measured (Earth's surface or along a borehole) into the region to be imaged, is done by 

using the Kirchhoff integral representation of a field at a given point as a (weighted) 

superposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and times (Yilmaz, 2001a). 



Chapter IV. Multichannel Seismic Data Processing of the BURATO4240 Survey 

131 
 

This migration algorithm was chosen to perform the post-stack migration of the seismic 

data, to compare with the pre-stack migration seismic files. In Kirchhoff migration, the 

most important parameters are the aperture width used in summation and the maximum 

dip to migrate. The Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration card used on SPW is presented in 

Figure IV.78. 

To build the correct processing to perform a good migration, a velocity card must be linked 

to the Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration card. In contrast to the Phase-Shift Migration, and 

similarly to the Stolt Migration, the Kirchhoff needs an rms velocity function input Figure 

IV.78). The input of the Kirchhoff Post-Stack Migration will be the Radon Demultiple 

seismic output, previously stacked.

IV.3.2.9 FLOW 8 - Bandwidth Extension 

Resolution is the ability to identify individual features or details in a given image, and 

seismic resolution involves both vertical (temporal) and horizontal (spatial) resolution. 

Temporal resolution is a function of the frequency content of a given signal. Achieving 

optimal thin bed resolution requires a broadband spectrum. Since most seismic is very 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

132 
 

band-limited it is desirable to extend the bandwidth of the data in a manner that is both 

verifiable and consistent with the geology, but it is important not to create artificial events 

(Smith et al., 2008). 

In seismic processing, many methods are employed to extend the bandwidth of the signal 

while maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Many deconvolution processes, 

such as spiking, attempt to sharpen the wavelet. Spectral whitening is also often 

employed to boost frequencies, most often on the high end (but sometimes on the low end 

as well) (Smith et al., 2008). In a general way, these processes tend to increase the noise 

level more than the signal and the amount of improvement expected is usually 

substantially less than an octave, which is where the most problems are (Smith et al., 

2008). However, new methods have been introduced which produce results that compare 

favorably to both well log synthetic seismograms and to geologic conditions (e.g., high 

frequency imaging; Hamarbatan et al., 2006). Most of these methods have concentrated 

on extending the upper end of the spectrum but, especially when one is going to invert the 

seismic data, extending the lower end is also very desirable (Smith et al., 2008).  

 

Bandwidth Extension Method 

A method called Bandwidth Extension was developed utilizing the Continuous Wavelet 

Transform (CWT) to extend the signal frequencies in both directions. Extending the 

bandwidth of a signal, both in the high end and the low end of the spectrum, has been a 

goal of seismic data acquisition and processing for a long time (Yilmaz, 2001a; Smith et 

al., 2008) (Figure IV.79). Spectral broadening, primarily high frequency extension, has 

been a controversial subject because of the belief that, due to the earth absorption of 

preferentially high frequencies, these are lost and it is impossible to restore them to the 

spectrum. However, several techniques, like Q-compensation (e.g.,Wang, 2006) have 

proven this assumption incorrect.  

Extension of bandwidth using harmonics and sub-harmonics predicted and computed with 

the CWT, will enhance the seismic resolution allowing a more refined and detailed 

interpretation. There are limitations: the sampling theorem limits the maximum 

recoverable reflectivity to Nyquist and anti-aliasing filters will set this limit below Nyquist. 

Also, frequencies available for harmonic prediction and limits introduced by a hard cut-off 

field filter and notch filter, as well as the uncertainty principle, affect the ability to extend 

bandwidth (Yilmaz, 2001a; Smith et al., 2008).

Figure IV.79 – Input data (a) and bandwidth-extended data (b) from an onshore 3D survey. Red 

traces are synthetic seismograms produced from well log reflectivity using an extracted wavelet 

from the respective data; horizontal timelines are separated by 100 ms (in Smith et al., 2008). 

 

The Widess model (Widess, 1973) suggests that there is seismic reflectivity available 

below one fourth of the dominant frequency wavelength. This information can therefore, in 

principle, be extracted, resulting in an increase in resolution by adding harmonic and sub-

harmonic frequencies back to the data. In addition, it is well known that it is desirable to 

have at least one and a half octaves, if not two octaves of bandwidth, to decrease side 

lobes and remove the „ringy? character of seismic data. Once this is done, many features 

such as minor faults, onlaps, pinch outs, and other stratigraphic subtle features come to 

light. All of these features can have a significant impact on the  interpretation of the 

seismic data and subsequent field discoveries (Smith et al., 2008) 

This processing step was adopted to increase the spatial resolution of the multichannel 

seismic data. On FlowChart, under the menu of Wavelet Shaping, the process Bandwidth 

Extension is available. This processing card can be linked to two seismic files (one acting 

as an input, and the other acting as an output file). On the Bandwidth Extension 

processing step, we can limit the data volume where this processing will be applied, and 

even chose the parameters which give better results (Figure IV.80).

To apply this seismic processing step, as already mentioned before, two seismic files card 

are needed: one input and one output. The complete seismic processing flow and 

parameters used are presented in Figure IV.81. The application of this process improved 

the resolution of the seismic profiles, as shown in Figure IV.82.

IV.3.2.10 FLOW 9 - Early Mute 

The seismic processing Early Mute, zeroes the beginning of the seismic traces. This mute 

is used to delete the noise preceding the first arrivals, or the area that the user had 

specifies (the beginning and the end time of the mute). In other words, the application of a 

Mute will kill all the amplitudes of the selected area. 

 

Apply Early Mute 

Finished the main processing steps and once obtained a good final seismic profile, the 

next phase is the cleaning of the non-important part of the section. For this particular 

work, the water column was not important. So, an Early Mute was applied to remove the 

ater column. 

In SPW the processing Mute is achieved by the application of an Early Mute. This Early 

Mute card is built on the SeisViewer. In SeisViewer, the final stacked seismic file is 

opened on a Seismic Window (see Figure IV.84). Then, using the Picks File Option the 

Early Mute option is selected. This operation is performed in exactly same way as the 

Waterbottom picks on the Deconvolution flow (Flow 3), changing just the type of pick file 

which is created (see Figure IV.84). 

Back to the FlowChart, this file is linked to an Apply Early Mute card which will link the 

input seismic file to the output seismic file (Figure IV.83). The output seismic file will be 

the same that the input seismic files, but with the amplitudes above the seafloor all zeroes 

(Figure IV.85).

IV.3.2.11 Seismic Data Output 

As mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter, the SPW software works its own SPW 

internal seismic formats, and in order to start the processing work, all seismic data files 

were first converted to SPW internal format. After the seismic processing is finished, the 

seismic files need to be reconverted to SEG-Y format, so that they can be into other 

softwares to perform the seismic interpretation. 

The re-convertion to SEG-Y is processed in the same way as the original seismic files 

were converted to SPW internal format. On the I/O Utility, on Data Reformat module, the 

processed seismic file is loaded and converted to SEG-Y (Figure IV.87). 

 

Figure IV.87 – SPW seismic processing flow 9 – Early Mute.

After this conversion, the processed seismic section can be opened in other seismic 

software, such SeisSee, Landmark, Paradigm, Kingdom Suite or Petrel, for example. 

 

IV. 4 Conclusions 

The seismic processing work carried out in the scope of this thesis, achieved satisfactory 

results, with the final data quality considered to be good to excellent, in particular for the 

deeper part of the seismic sections, which was one of the main aims of this work. Some 

multiple energy still remains in the seismic data, in particular some energy of the 

seabottom multiple. However, in most of the seismic lines this multiple energy was much 

suppressed allowing the interpretation of some deeper reflections. 

One of the problems in seismic data over processing is the “facility to modify” the quality 

of the seismic traces, and sometimes gets a final section with several false seismic events 

which do not truly exist, and lead the interpreter to a serious mistake. In this processing 

work, the true seismic events were maintained as untouched as possible, most of the 

times were improved, and the unwanted energy, like multiples and frequency noise, were 

removed or attenuated. Attention was also taken to avoid creating artificial events. In 

summary the objectives proposed to the seismic data processing were fully achieved. 

Velocity analysis is always a great challenge due to high sensibility of the velocity picking 

and lack of focusing of the semblance plots. The velocity analysis carried out on gathers 

after DMO corrections, improved the semblance and allowed a more detailed velocity 

model. 

A clear improvement on the re-processed seismic sections was the removal of the Source 

ghost. The application of a Predictive Deconvolution, using the second zero of the 

autocorrelation function as the predictive length, has totally suppressed this multiple 

event, induced by a gun desynchronization, allowing to see some seismic energy which 

was being masked by this ghost. 

When the subsurface structures are simple, post-stack migration works well. However, 

post-stack migration is not faithful in areas with complex geology and complex variations 

in velocities. To overcome this difficulty, pre-stack migration is required which is a better 

imaging tool which works quite well in these areas. To image reflections from dipping 

events recorded with today's wide offset acquisitions requires both faithful handling of 

vertical velocity gradients and attention of anisotropy are required, which are taken care of 

in pre-stack migration. However, post-stack migration is much faster than pre-stack 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

140 
 

migration, because stacking reduces the number of traces that must be processed. Also, 

post-stack migration is cheaper ad less computationally intensive than pre-stack 

migration. However, pre-stack time migration, despite being it time and resources 

consuming generally gives better results than post-stack migration. The use of a pre-stack 

migration algorithm on this dataset was therefore justified due to the improvements 

obtained on the seismic sections. 

The application of new processing steps, such as extend the bandwidth of the signal, 

while maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, helped to improve significantly the 

vertical resolution of the seismic profiles.  

With the seismic data re-processing, the quality and resolution of the most seismic lines 

were improved, in particular, the basement and the faults. This improvement was clearly 

influenced by the accuracy of the velocity model. Indeed, the velocity analysis is 

considered one of the most important steps in seismic data processing. The several 

velocity models created for each seismic profile (see Figure IV.36; Figure IV.88) were 

created in order to get the best final seismic profile. Of course, the quality of the final 

section will also depend on the migration algorithm chosen (Phase-Shift, Stolt, Kirkchhoff) 

and if it is applied pre- or post-stack. 

As example, we can see on the seismic line GB-10b that with the post-stack Kirchhoff 

migration algorithm, the faults are more clearly, comparing with the onboard processed 

seismic profile. Using the same velocity model, but using a pre-stack Phase-Shift time 

migration, the resolution of the faults are not that good, but the basement is more visible. 

Both of the re-processed seismic profiles are better than the preliminary one, due to the 

more carefully velocity analysis better migration algorithms, in particular pre-stack, and 

because of the bandwidth resolution improvement with the Bandwidth Extension 

processing (Figure IV.88). 

Another seismic line, that shows a similar improvement is the seismic line GB-22, were 

the basement were not very good on the preliminary processed profile, and where the re-

processing improved it definition. This improvement is very usefully for the seismic 

interpretation work, because it makes possible to distinguish the boundary between 

layers. The re-processing of this line was also performed using a post-stack and pre-stack 

migration and the results are shown in Figure IV.89. 

As future wok regarding seismic data processing, it is recommended that an AVO 

(Amplitude versus Offset) data processing is considered as a tool to assist the 

interpretation of the data; in particular to study the existence of gas in the sedimentary

141 
 

layers. In this dataset, this procedure was preliminary tested comparing stacked sections 

of near- and far-channels, but no supported conclusion were possible to make, due to 

time limitations. 

In summary, the processing flow adopted to perform the re-processing of the 2D 

multichannel seismic data was successful and in the end permitted a considerably quality 

improvement. This seismic data re-processing was essential for the seismic interpretation 

work, mostly because of the basement resolution and visibility improvement, in the most 

representative lines.

Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the 
BURATO4240 Survey 

 

 

This Chapter presents the results from the seismic interpretation of the processed seismic 

data. A brief introduction to seismic interpretation fundamentals and methods is also 

presented at the beginning of the chapter. This more detailed interpretation was carried 

out using as a basis the preliminary interpretation produced for the cruise report. 

 

V. 1 Introduction 

The geological significance of a seismic profile and the fundamentals of seismic 

acquisition and processing, along with a knowledge of the structural and sedimentary 

geology are the basic materials on which the interpretation skills are built (Jenyon and 

Fitch, 1985). Seismic reflections are generated at interfaces which may be bedding 

planes, unconformities, fault planes, intrusive contacts or any other boundary between 

rocks with different physical properties. 

In seismic interpretation, a fundamental assumption is generally made – “there is a one to 

one correspondence between a seismic arrival and a geological horizon” (Jenyon and 

Fitch, 1985). The work of the seismic interpreter is most of the times considered “clear 

and straightforward” in areas of simple geology and little or no commercial interest for 

petroleum purposes, but difficult and complicated in the areas of complex geology and 

possible hydrocarbon accumulation, and therefore of a potential commercial interest. 

Geologists define stratigraphic surfaces or horizons in several ways. However, the basic 

definition is in terms of significance time (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). A geological horizon is 

defined as the top surface of a sedimentary unit laid down at a given moment in time, and 

which can be defined with a time-stratigraphic or chronostratigraphic significance (Jenyon 

and Fitch, 1985). In order to “date” these horizons, two alternatives or strategies can be 

used (e.g. Mitchum and Vail, 1977): 

? A first alternative is to use a “bio-stratigraphic” subdivision; based on the 

appearance or disappearance of some key fossil, or “zone” fossil, which is used to 

date the zone by its presence. 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

148 
 

? A second alternative is the use of a litho-stratigraphic division; this divides the 

geological sequence into the mapped units by the surface geologist or the 

subsurface formations identified by the subsurface geologist. 

 

Continuity and Correlation on the Seismic Interpretation: 

The work of seismic interpretation can be performed, in the first place, by following two 

important definitions: continuity and correlation. Continuity is defined as the property 

observed on a seismic section whereby a consistent pulse shape, which is the seismic 

arrival of a reflection, can be recognized on successive traces with, perhaps, small 

changes in arrival time from trace to trace (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985).  The length of the 

continuity represents the “area of confidence” from which the interpretation work can be 

carried out; this may be interrupted and affected by poor data in which the continuity 

cannot be traced. Seismic continuity of a reflection is not an expression of the continuity of 

a geological unit; rather it is an expression of the continuity of two geological units, one 

immediately above the other (boundary or interface), and requires that both formations are 

continuous. The human eye is able to follow continuity on traces whose signal-to-noise 

ratio is considerably less than 1:1 (Figure V.1), and the limits of confident interpretation 

are set by the signal-to-noise ratio (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

 

Figure V.1 – Seismic continuity: a) good continuity; b) poor continuity; c) doubtful continuinity (in 

Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

 

Correlation (Figure V.2.) is defined as a purely pattern recognition which can be a single 

pulse, distinguished by its length, amplitude or shape, observed in consecutive traces. 

Correlation is used by the interpreter primarily to relate one “area of confidence” to 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

149 
 

another. The criteria to establish correlation are quite varied, and may vary with the nature 

of the correlation desired. There are three main types of correlation, which correspond to 

the three definitions of stratigraphic level: time-stratigraphic correlation, bio-stratigraphic 

correlation, and litostratigraphic correlation (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). Seismic correlation 

depends on two features of the reflections: the shapes of the individual pulses which 

make up the sequence of reflections; and the sequence of the reflections and their 

spacing (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985).  

 

Figure V.2 – Seismic correlation; location (b) is 1mile from location (a) and location (c) is 10 miles 
from location (a). The correlation of the seismic events 1 to 5 between a and b is relatively easy; 
but from (b) to (c) is not so simple (in Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

 

Selecting a Seismic Horizon 

The primary purpose of most seismic surveys is to determine geological structures. This is 

accomplished by tracing identifiable seismic horizons on seismic sections. Where 

continuity can be recognized, it is picked, using either a pencil (when working on paper) 

on using a drawing tool (when using interpretation software). Where continuity fails, a gap 

is left, and the picking is resumed when the tests of correlation permit the recognition of 

the same horizons at another location (Mitchum and Vail, 1977). In this picking process, 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

150 
 

either peak or trough of the seismic trace can be selected; also, either a manual, semi-

manual or automatic tool can be used (in the case of digital interpretation). 

 

Geological Unconformities  

In the pursuit of continuity or correlation of a seismic reflector, sometimes a split on a 

reflection is identified (non-continuous reflectors). Looking in the reverse direction, the 

seismic interpreter will find a reflection which is terminated, and cannot be traced further. 

This is a troublesome phenomenon, because it is one which may have geological 

significance – or it may not. Toplap or onlap relationships among other reflection 

terminations could be recognized (Figure V.3) as the origin of non-continuous reflectors 

(Mitchum and Vail, 1977; Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). Other types of 

reflector terminations are depicted in Figure V.4. 

 

Figure V.3 – Diagram of the geological relationships at toplap and onlap types of unconformities. 

 

Interpretation decisions are much less difficult after two reflections converge to yield a 

single reflection alignment. For this reason it is a good plan to select mapping horizons in 

the deepest part of a basin, after a quick review of the whole area to establish that the 

chosen reflections have a wide development (Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 

1985). Where decisions are taken at a “split”, it is imperative that consistent decisions are 

made at every other point where that split appears in the seismic section, or in other 

profiles from the same survey. In other words, if a sequence A terminates against 

sequence B, and sequence B continuous, at any other locations where there are doubts 

about the continuation of A and B, A most be the one who terminates. 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey

Summary of the differences between geological and seismic sections. 

Seismic sections are generally plotted in time, while the real Earth is in depth. The time-

series is plotted vertically below the observation point. However, the reflection point will, 

generally, not lie vertically below the observation point. 

The seismic section also contains elements which do not have a direct relationship to the 

underlying reflecting geological horizons: noise; multiple reflections arrivals; alignments or 

noisy waves, etc. (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

 

V. 2 Seismic Stratigraphy 

Seismic stratigraphy in very general terms, aims at identifying stratigraphic sequences 

and events on the seismic data. It generally deals with seismic data at three different 

levels (e.g. Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). The first level, usually termed 

“sequence analysis”, attempts to divide the seismic section into a series of major 

depositional units – depositional sequences
5
 – separated by time hiatuses which are 

normally important unconformities of regional significance. By considering the occurrence 

of “transgressive” and “regressive” units within the sequences, and by tracing the 

unconformities laterally to their correlative conformities, it is sought to establish an 

absolute geological time-frame work for the study area that can be regional – or even at 

worldwide level – by correlating these unconformities with changes in sea level throughout 

geological time. At the second level, the techniques of “facies analysis” examine the 

pattern of seismic events within a sequence, with the objective of defining depositional 

environments and facies developments, the evolution of which, in total, makes up the 

sequence. At the third level, the individual seismic event is subjected to scrutiny, to 

determine the geological significance of lateral changes in its shape along the section (in 

its various forms almost invariably requires special reprocessing of the data) (e.g. Sloss 

and Moritz, 1950; Mitchum et al., 1977b,a; Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Jenyon and Fitch, 

1985). 

However, it shoud not be imagined that the methodical application of these three groups 

of techniques falls within the everyday experience of the interpreter. Rather, he should be 

aware of the first two groups as an ordered approach to the seismic section and of the 

possibilities of the third group when a specific problem is to be addressed (Jenyon and 

Fitch, 1985).

  A Depositional Sequence is a  stratigraphic unit composed of relatively conformable sucessions 

of genetically strata and bounded at its top and base by unconformities or their correlative 
conformities (Vail and Mitchum, 1977).

V.2.1 Fundamentals of Seismic Sequence Stratigraphy 

On a seismic profile, the parts that are missing, due to non-deposition or erosion 

processes, are sometimes more significant from the point of view of the passage of 

geological time, than the parts which are indeed present. Some major hiatuses, 

represented by surfaces of unconformities, are surely linked to important geological 

events – to marine transgressions and regressions, to long periods of sub-aerial or 

shallow marine erosion, or to periods of sustained sedimentation (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985; 

Mitchum et al., 1977a; Vail et al., 1977). “Non-sequences” or disconformities due to 

sediment starvation, redistribution due to changes from low to high energy environments, 

or shifts in marine paleocurrents (and winds in the case of terrigenous deposits), 

frequently leave the stratigraphic column as a very imperfect record of total sedimentation 

allowing the interpreter to delineate expected geological times. (Mitchum et al., 1977a; 

Vail and Mitchum, 1977);  

A great care is needed in seismic sequence stratigraphy. The seismic data alone are 

insufficient for decisive conclusions to be drawn, and all available geological input to the 

sequence model must be included in the final analysis (e.g. wells). 

 

Seismic sequences and unconformities  

The two most important aspects of sequence analysis are (i) the separation of major 

depositional units (sequence) in the section by recognizing their bounding unconformities 

(or conformities which are correlateable to unconformities in an adjacent area), and (ii) the 

recognition of the pattern of sedimentation above the unconformity surface from the 

seismic response such that relative vertical changes (eustatic changes) in sea level can 

be recognized and measured (Vail et al., 1977) 

The relationships of reflections configurations at bounding unconformities are in a number 

of different ways depending upon the attitude of the underlying series, the existence of 

any erosional or diastrophic effects, or the configuration of internal structure (Figure V.4). 

The termination of reflections at an unconformity surface is the principal evidence of the 

presence of a sequence boundary, and terminology has been developed to describe the 

various relationships seen, depending upon wether the events are terminating at an 

overlying or underlying unconformity surface (Vail and Mitchum, 1977), as shown in 

Figure V.4. The most commonly used are truncation and toplap, where sediments 

starvation rather than very marked erosion has produced the unconformity and the 

underlying terminations. In areas where well data is available, it may be possible, after 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

153 
 

careful analysis, to date the major sequence boundaries with reasonable certainty, and 

assign provisional ages to the other boundaries. 

 

Figure V.4 – Relationships of reflection configurations at bounding unconformities, and within a 
sequence (Mitchum et al., 1977). 

 

Sea level fluctuations and depositional patterns 

An unconformity, apart from representing a time hiatus, also provides a depositional 

surface upon which sedimentation of the overlying sequence takes place. It has been 

noted at many locations, that throughout geological time, there is evidence from 

observation of varying lithologies and palaentology that apparent cyclic fluctuations of sea 

level have occurred (Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Vail et al., 1977). It is obviously highly 

desirable to establish a correlation with seismic data and filed geology, since it would give 

an immediate and independent means of determining the geological age of a depositional 

sequence anywhere on Earth (Vail and Mitchum, 1977; Vail et al., 1977).  

Several different approaches to this problem have been taken, and embodied in the 

techniques of seismic sequence stratigraphy. The methods first suggested by Vail and 

Mitchum (1977) and other researchers from the Exxon group are the basis for sucvh an 

approach (for further detail see Vail et al., 1977 and Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

The general proposed procedure is summarized in Figure V.5. Sequence boundaries and 

the traces of chronostratigraphic surfaces are marked on the seismic section (a), and from 

them a chronostratigraphic chart is constructed (b), which indicates the spatial and 

temporal extent of the various sequences present, and also highlights any erosional or 

non-depositional hiatuses. From this information, using the estimates of coastal 

aggradation and/or coastal encroachment measured from the seismic section, a regional 

chart of relative sea level changes is produced (c) (Vail et al., 1977). However, as said 

before, some modifications have been made to this procedure since then (e.g. Brown and 

Fischer, 1979; Hallam, 1981; Van Hinte, 1982; Donovan and Jones, 1979).

Figure V.5 – Basic procedure for constructing regional charts of cycles of relative changes of sea 

level (Vail et al., 1977). 

 

V.2.2 Facies Analysis. 

In sequence analysis, the establishment of a basic time/space framework of the major 

depositional intervals separated by non-depositional or erosional intervals is the primary 

approach. This determination of the seismic response and the recognition on the seismic 

section of different types of depositional facie s is obviously of greatest importance in 

hydrocarbon exploration. The main classes of characteristics in the seismic data utilized in 

facies analysis can be summarized in three cathegories: (i) those at the boundaries of 

sequences; (ii) those within the sequences, and (iii) those defining the overall external 

shape of the facies unit (Mitchum et al., 1977b). 

 

Seismic characteristics at unconformities 

In the case of a suprajacent unconformity, two main types of terminations can be 

distinguished: erosional truncation or toplap (Figure V.4). Erosional truncation in its 

simplest form is probably the most easily recognized. The actual erosion surface itself 

may or may not produce a recognizable event and the unconformity is more or less well 

defined by the truncated reflections below. Toplap may sometimes not be easily 

distinguished from truncation. It is produced rather by non-deposition or sediment 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

155 
 

starvation, with perhaps minor erosion. Usually the terminations reflections show only low 

angularity or even parallelism with the overlying unconformity (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). 

In the case of the subjacent unconformity, the terminations reflections are defined as 

onlap or downlap (Figures V.3 and V.4). Onlap occurs where bedding reflections 

progressively overlap a dipping unconformity surface; they are often horizontal or dip 

more generally in the same sense as the unconformity. On a downlap, the reflections 

identified are usually more inclined, and terminate the underlying unconformity surface 

(Mitchum et al., 1977b; Jenyon and Fitch, 1985; Figure V.4). 

 

Types of Reflection Configuration Patterns  

The characteristics of the reflections within the seismic events may be classified in terms 

of their continuity, attitude within the unit, amplitude, frequency, and internal velocity, 

which are related to geological elements within the lithological facies such as continuity, 

strata spacing/thickness, lithology, porosity, fluid content, erosional effects, and the 

presence of any gas/liquid contacts (Jenyon and Fitch, 1985). An adequate analysis of the 

internal configuration of a facies unit and its external form, as well as its relationship to 

other units, can lead to an understanding of the overall depositional and 

paleophysiographic environment involved, and allows the possibility of prediction of the 

lithologies present. 

The classification of internal reflection configurations is performed mainly based on the 

terminology developed by Mitchum et al. (1977c), which includes, among other 

classifications: parallel, subparallel, divergent, sigmoid, oblique, chaotic, and reflection-

free configurations (Figure V.6). Several qualifying adjectives such as wavy, uniform, 

contorted, disrupted, are commonly applied to the above terms to describe minor changes 

of the reflections features (Figure V.6). 

 

Figure V.6 – Seismic reflections configurations and patterns (modified from Mitchum et al., 1977c). 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia

External form of Seismic Units or Facies 

An understanding of the three dimensional external form of seismic facies is an important 

step in their anaylises. The relationship of reflections to bounding unconformities, the 

degree of continuity of the amplitude, could be an evidence of the environmental energy of 

deposition (Sangree and Widmier, 1977). Sheet, wedge; bank and mound forms facies 

are commonly detected on seismic profiles (Mitchum et al., 1977b). Other facies are the 

fill facies which gives further information about the energy of the depositional system 

(Figure V.7).

al., 1977c). 

 

V. 3 Seismic Interpretation of the data from the Gran Burato area 

In order to create a reliable geological and seismo-stratigraphic interpretation, the 

available 2D seismic reflection data from the Gran Burato area, together with its corrected 

navigation, was imported into a seismic database using the seismic interpretation 

package, Kingdom Suite (KS). Based on the seismo-stratigraphy defined for this region by 

Murillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al (2008), the main and regional discontinuities, which 

represent the boundaries between the defined seismic units (see Chapter II – Section II.4) 

were interpreted. Faults within the study area were interpreted in each seismic section 

individually and the main faults that affect the Gran Burato structure were spatially 

mapped and correlated wherever possible. 

Just after the cruise, a preliminary interpretation of the main seismic horizons was carried 

out and spatially correlated from section to section by the University of Aveiro team in 

which the author participated (Pinheiro et al., 2010). However and mainly due to the fact 

that only a preliminary onboard seismic processing was available then, the deeper 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

157 
 

horizons could not be fully interpreted. Although, some faults had also been picked, a full 

interpretation and the spatial correlation of these events were not carried out at that stage. 

In the scope of this thesis the seismic interpretation was revised and improved with a 

more detailed work, in particular in what concerns the deeper seismic units. Then, the 

main faults were spatially correlated and time and depth horizon and structural maps were 

produced for the top of the main interpreted seismic stratigraphic units.  

 

V.3.1 The Kingdom Suite Software 

The Kingdom Suite interpretation software package, developed by Seismic Micro-

Technology Inc., enables intuitive, integrated geoscientific workflow spanning, with several 

available modules: 

i. 2d/3dPak - allows to interpret 2D and 3D seismic data, map and grid surfaces, and 

include well control; 

ii. EarthPAK – enables geoscientists to manage logs, manipulate cross sections, 

analyze production, and create presentation quality base maps using geological 

data. 

iii. VuPAK – integration of geological and geophysical information in 3D space, which 

helps geoscientists make more accurate interpretations and achieve higher 

productivity,  

iv. Geomodeling - powerful 3D modeling tool that creates sealed geocellular earth 

models which are used in conjunction with the other KINGDOM tools for structural 

and stratigraphic closure, interpretation, volumetric calculations, and reserve 

analysis. 

v. Several other modules as Rock Solid Attributes (RSA); AVOPAK; SynPAK; 

ModPAK; VelPAK. 

 

The main desktop window of the Kingdom Suite can be divided into 4 different working 

areas: a project tree with all the project contents (e.g. faults, horizons, seismic lines, wells) 

a 2D window to display vertical seismic sections; and a base map with the location of the 

study area where all the features can be displayed. There is also the possibility to work 

with a 3D window that can be opened to help in the integrated visualization of the 

interpretation work (Figure V.8).

2D views, and basemap. 

 

V.3.1 Importing Seismic Data 

During the acquisition cruise, all the processed seismic lines (in SEG-Y format) were 

imported into a Kingdom Suite (KS) project (Figure V.8), to check for inconsistent 

navigation among crossing seismic lines. After this quality control, the navigation for each 

seismic profile was fixed ensuring its exact location of it. With all the navigation issues 

solved, a crossover analysis of the sea-bottom reflection was performed to identify and 

correct existent local vertical miss-ties. 

After re-processing the seismic sections which had lower imaging quality (see Chapter III), 

the new processed files were uploaded into the GranBurato Kingdom Suite project, 

replacing the preliminary processed seismic lines. 

 

V.3.2 Seismic-Stratigraphic Horizons 

The seismic interpretation was carried out taking into account the seismic-stratigraphic 

framework published in the literature (e.g. Murillas et al. (1990); see Chapter II - Section 

II.4). The interpreted seismic horizons were selected according to their regional 

characteristics and configurations, and correspond to discontinuities within the 

sedimentary record that may represent both erosion and lack of deposition periods. A total 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

159 
 

of 7 seismic horizons, including the seabottom, were interpreted in each seismic section 

and spatially correlated, down to a depth of 2-3 seconds (TWT) below the seafloor. 

The seismic horizon interpretation was performed mainly recurring to the manual picking 

tool of the Kingdom Suite; in some particular cases, where the continuity of the reflector 

was high, the Auto2D Fill option was also used. After the interpretation, all the horizons 

were interpolated to create regional surfaces using the FlexGridding Method with a cell 

size of 200m x 200m. This horizons grid can be viewed in both 2D or 3D windows. 

 

V.3.2.1 Seabottom 

The seabottom was interpreted in all seismic sections using the 2D Auto-Fill tool of the 

Kingdom Suite package, which produced excellent results. 

The seabottom reveals several negative structures ranging in size from meters to 

kilometers. The biggest depression corresponds to the investigated structure denominated 

the Gran Burato, which is clearly visible and identified on the acquired seismic lines 

(Figure V.9). Other smaller seafloor depressions are also visible and were interpreted; 

some of them near the Gran Burato area and other farther away (Figure V.9; see also 

V.3.4 Figure V. 45 and Figure V. 46). These small depressive structures are also probably 

pockmarks related to gas seepage. 

 

Figure V.9 – Seismic Lines GB07 that crosses the Gran Burato pockmark depression. The inset 
shows other small-scale seafloor depressions filled with sediments, also probably related to gas 
seepage, and interpreted as buried pockmarks (vertical scale in sec – TWT). 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

160 
 

The interpretation grid of this horizon results in a pseudo-bathymetry of the study area. 2D 

and 3D displays (Figure V.10) allow the identification and delineation of the main and 

larger-scale negative structures. The seabottom physiography is gentle, and ranges 

between 2.1s and 3.0s (TWT), i.e around 1500 and 2250m, in most part of the study area 

(Figure V.10). It is deeper in the Easthern part, reaching 3.7s (TWT), i.e 2770m; near the 

seismic line GB-40 where a large depression can be observed which may indicate the 

presence of an important fault (see Figure V.37).

V.3.2.2 Seismic Unit 1 (Seabottom – H1) 

Seismic Unit 1 is easily identified in all the study area due to its high lateral continuity, 

which allows an easy spatial correlation from line to line. The thickness of this 

sedimentary layer is about 0.7s - 0.8s (TWT) (180m to 600m; see Figure V. 30). However, 

in the central part of the study area, near the Gran Burato structure, it has a thickness of 

less than 0.2s (TWT). This seismic unit, based on the interpretation carried out in the 

scope of the GRAN-BURATO 2010 project and this thesis, can be divided in three sub-

units: 1A, 1B and 1C, separated from each other by strong continuous reflections (Figure 

V.11). 

The sub-unit 1A (Figure V.11) is characterized by high lateral continuity, and strong 

reflections with high amplitude values. This sub-unit has parallel stratified facies and is 

highly affected by faults throughout its length. The thickness of this sub-unit is more or 

less constant in all the study area, around 0.4s (TWT). However, in the Gran Burato zone, 

this sub-unit is thinner or is even absent, maybe due to erosion induced by ocean currents 

or by gas seepage. Sub-Unit 1B (Figure V.11) has an average thickness of 0.2-0.3s 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

161 
 

(TWT) in the most part of the study area, and is also affected by faults. This sub-unit has a 

high lateral continuity but with low amplitude. The sub-unit 1C (Figure V.11) has a variable 

thickness up to 0.12s (TWT) and it is characterized by strong amplitude reflections with 

high lateral continuity. 

 

Figure V.11 – Seismic line GB-04 with interpreted seismic horizons H1 (blue line). The inset shows 

the subunits identified within the Seismic Unit 1 (vertical scale in sec – TWT). 

 

Within the Gran Burato area, the SU-1 is characterized by chaotic facies associated with 

cut-and-fill features, and deformed deposits close to the Gran Burato area. This unit 

shows a contorted aspect due to faulting and folding probably related to the Cenozoic 

tectonism. 

The seismic horizon H1 (Figure V.13) corresponds to the base of this unit which is topped 

by the seafloor (Figure V.10). This seismic unit corresponds to the Seismic Unit 1 already 

described by Murillas et al. (1990) and Ercilla et al. (2007), composed of turbidites and 

hemipelagites/pelagite of Late Eaocene to recent ages. 

 

V.3.2.3 Seismic Unit 2 (H1-H2) 

The Seismic Unit 2 (SU-2) is separated from Seismic Unit 1 by a high continuity, strong 

high amplitude reflection (blue line in Figure V.11 and in Figure V.12). The thickness of 

SU-2 ranges from 0.2s to 0.4s (TWT) (60m to 380m; see Figure V. 30) in all the study 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

162 
 

area. Similar to SU-1, it is highly affected by many major and minor faults. This seismic 

unit is characterized by stratified continuous and discontinuous reflections with high 

amplitude. It shows a semi-transparent to transparent seismic texture in the deepest 

parte. On the Gran Burato flanks, this unit shows a parallel to subparallel configuration 

(Figure V.12).  

 

Figure V.12 – Seismic line GB 32 with interpreted seismic horizons H1 (blue line) and H2 (yellow 
line) that represent the top and base of the seismic unit SU-2, respectively. The inset shows it 
seismic character and faulting (vertical scale in seconds – TWT). 

 

Below the Gran Burato, SU-2 is characterized by chaotic facies and deformed sediments, 

probably due to the compression and intense faulting that affects this region. This unit 

seems to drape on the old topography, revealing no evidence of important tectonic activity 

during its deposition. 

SU-2 corresponds to the claystones, marls rich in nanno-fossils and pelagites of Seismic 

Unit 2 described in previous works (Murillas et al. 1990, Ercilla et al., 2007), which 

estimate its deposition took place from the Senoniam to Middle Eocene. 

The Seismic Unit 2 is topped by the seismic horizon H1 (Figure V.13) and limited at its 

base by the seismic horizon H2 (Figure V.16). The seismic horizon H1 lies at depths 

between 2.5s and 4s (TWT) below the water surface (Figure V.13). A depression is also 

observed on the NE corner of the study area (Figure V.13), probably supporting the 

hypothesis of existence of a fault. In the Gran Burato area and to the SE, the depth of the 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

163 
 

H1 is shallower. Figure V.13 is shows the top of the Seismic Unit 2 in a 2D grid and in a 

3D view.  

Figure V.13 – H1 (top of the SU-2) grid displayed in a (a) 2D map and in a (b) 3D view. 

 

V.3.2.4 Seismic Unit 3 (H2-H3) 

The Seismic Unit 3 (SU-3) is observed across all the study area, with exception of some 

areas below the Gran Burato, where its presence is uncertain. This seismic unit shows a 

variable thickness (few to 0.45s in TWT) (up to 480m; see Figure V. 31) and, as already 

mentioned, an irregular distribution along the entire study area. It seems to be better 

developed to the W of the Gran Burato, and its thickness decreases abruptly to the E of 

this structure (Figure V.14).  

Seismic Unit 3 is characterized by semi-transparent to continuous and parallel stratified 

facies. Locally it may show strong-reflectors with short lateral continuity and high lateral 

continuity and also internal reflections with low amplitudes. Near the Gran Burato, this unit 

shows evidence of chaotic facies, probably associated with disturbed sediments that may 

represent cut-and-fill features and slumps. SU-3 is affected by major faults, and often 

shows its termination in form of pinch-outs (Figure V.15). This unit drapes and onlaps onto 

the paleotopography and locally infills, indicating a deposition without significant 

tectonism. 

This seismic unit is topped by the seismic horizon H2 (Figure V.16), which ranges in depth 

between 2.6s (TWT) and 4s (TWT). This seismic horizon follows the geometry of the 

previous one and again the deepest area is observed on the NE corner. Two structural

highs are observed: the first in the Gran Burato area, and the second one to the 

Southeast (Figure V.16).

Figure V.16 – Top of the Seismic Unit 3 (seismic horizon H2) grid displayed in a (a) 2D map and in 

a (b) 3D view. 

 

The seismic horizon H2 is the top of SU-3, which corresponds to the Seismic Unit 3 (e.g. 

Murillas et al., 1990) described on the Chapter II, which probably separates the Albian 

“black shales” from the Senonian to Eocene sediments (SU-2) at DSDP site 398 (Sibuet 

et al., 1979). 

 

V.3.2.5 Seismic Unit 4 (H3-H4) 

The Seismic Unit 4 (SU-4) is separated from SU-3 by a strong reflection (which according 

to Murillas et al., 1990, corresponds to the latest Aptian break-up unconformity) and is 

strongly affected by faults. It can be interpreted in all the extension of the study area. It is 

characterized by partially strong-reflections with short-lateral continuity, transparent facies, 

low amplitudes reflections, and chaotic facies, particularly in the vicinity of the structural 

high below the Gran Burato and other similar structural acoustic basement highs. On the 

flanks of the main structural high of the study area it is possible to identify its termination 

as pinch-outs (Figure V.17). This unit infills the existent half-grabens and locally covers 

the buried horst-and-graben structures of the acoustic basement. The infilling 

configurations can be classified as subparalell and divergent. Its thickness is variable to a 

maximum of 0.45s (TWT) (up to 800m; see Figure V. 31 ), and is not observed in most 

areas below the Gran Burato (Figure V.17). SU-4 is topped by the seismic horizon H3 

(Figure V.18), which was interpreted between 2.75s and 4.20s (TWT) below the sea 

surface. The thichest values are observed in the Northern and Southern parts of the study 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia

area. On the H3 grid surface, two structural highs are observed, like on the H2 time grid: 

the first one in the Gran Burato area and the second to the South (Figure V.18). 

 

Figure V.17 – Seismic line GB-32 with the interpretation of the seismic horizons H1 (blue), H2 
(yellow), H3 (green), and H4 (dark blue). The red box represents horizontal and subparalell 
deposition which indicate post-rift sediments; the dotted red circle corresponds to a pinch-out; 
vertical scale in seconds (TWT). 

 

This stratigraphic unit does not show significant evidence of relevant tectonic activity 

during its deposition, since its seismic internal reflectors are mainly parallel to sub-parallel 

and seem to drape on the paleotopography. This seismic configuration indicates that SU-4 

was deposited in a post-rift environment infilling grabens and half-grabens (Figure V.17).

This unit corresponds to the Seismic Unit 4 described by Murillas et al. (1990) 

(Hauterivian to late Aptian in age) as a syn-and post-rift deposits of turbidite sandstones 

and siltstones with intercalations of clays and marls. However, in the interpretation 

discussed here, no evidences of syn-rift deposition were found. 

 

V.3.2.6 Seismic Unit 5 (H4-H5) 

The Seismic Unit 5 (SU-5) is severely affected by deep faults, and is characterized by 

fault-rotated blocks (probably of the basement), associated with the rift episodes that 

affected this margin (Figure V.19; Figure V.20; Figure V.21). Sedimentary wedges with 

sub-parallel and divergent sedimentation patterns are clearly observed (Figure V.20; 

Figure V.21). The divergent configuration of the sedimentary wedges deposited on top of 

the basement blocks, indicates that the faults were moving while SU-5 was being 

deposited. Thus, SU-5 is classified here as a syn-rift unit (Figure V.20; Figure V.21). The 

thickness of this seismic unit ranges between 0.05s to 0.4s (TWT) (130m to 1000m; see 

Figure Figure V. 32). SU-5 corresponds to the Seismic Unit 5 (Murillas et al., 1990) 

presented above on the Chapter II, which has been classified as sandstones and 

claystones of Valanginian age. Acoustically, SU-5 is characterized by variable amplitudes, 

with some low frequency reflectors. It is classified as having a semi-transparent and 

disrupted facies, as well as chaotic facies with local strong amplitudes, particularly near 

the Gran Burato region (Figure V.19). 

 

Figure V.19 – Seismic line GB-24 with the interpretation of the seismic horizons H1 (blue), H2

unit.

in 2D map and 3D view, where it can be observed that this horizon TWT ranges from 2.5s

V.3.2.7 Seismic Unit 6 (Top H5) 

The description of this formation is based on the deeper seismic events identified on the 

interpreted seismic sections; it corresponds to the acoustic basement. Seismic Unit 6 is 

distinguished from SU-5 by a strong clear reflection that corresponds to the interpreted 

seismic horizon H5 (orange line in Figure V.23 and in Figure V.24). In Figure V.25 a 2D 

grid map and a 3D view of this horizon is presented, showing that H5 lays between 2.9s 

and 4.9s (TWT).  

With the available dataset the base of the SU-6 unit could not be interpreted since it is not 

clearly imaged and that is why it is considered the acoustic basement. However some 

strong reflections can still be observed above its top boundary (Figure V.23; Figure V.24). 

These strong reflections could correspond to Seismic Unit 6, Seismic Unit 7 or to the 

basement, according to the seismo-stratigraphy presented by Murillas et al. (1990). The 

available dataset for the present work does not permit further details.  

This seismic unit may represent: (a) an Upper Jurassic sedimentary layer deposited 

during an Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian extensional episode (Mauffret and Montadert, 1987); 

(b) a sedimentary sequences from the Lower and Middle Jurassic or even from the

Triassic; (c) Paleozoic sediments; (d) intrabasement features of a non-sedimentary origin, 

such as thrust faults or detachment faults (Murillas et al., 1990).

V.3.3 Depth and Thickness Maps of the Seismic-Stratigraphic Units 

With all the interpretation grids for each of the seismic-stratigraphic units created in time, 

the next step, in the absence of well log data, is the creation of an empiric and simplistic 

seismic velocity model to convert them from time-to-depth and calculate the respective 

isopach maps. 

Since the seismic signal is recorded in Two-Way-Time (TWT), in seconds, to convert the 

interpreted maps from time to depth it is necessary to establish the interval velocity for 

each stratigraphic unit. The conversion from time to depth for each horizon can be then 

performed using the simple equation (Equation 9): 

 

    
      
 

 

   

  

 

where di is the depth of the horizon i, Vi is the seismic interval velocity characteristic of 

each formation (the interval velocity of the propagation of the p-waves), and ti is the time 

(in seconds, TWT) corresponding to the diference between the top horizon and the base 

horizon of each seismic unit. 

The velocity model adopted to compute the depth and thickness maps for each 

interpreted seismic unit is composed of the velocities defined in Murillas et al., 1990, 

Eq.9 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

172 
 

combined with the stacking and migration velocities obtained during the seismic 

processing workflow. Due to the lack of other data, a layer-cake velocity model was built 

with constant velocities for each layer (seismic-stratigraphic unit). Therefore, the velocity 

model considered for the time-to-depth conversion is composed of 6 layers: the water 

column; SU-1, SU-2, SU-3, SU-4, and SU-5 (Figure V.26). To compute the seabottom 

depth map a constant velocity of 1500m/s was used.  

 

Figure V.26 – Layer cake velocity model adopted for the study area (vertical scale in seconds –

TWT). 

 

The resulting 2D depth maps for the top of each seismic stratigraphic unit are presented in 

Figure V. 27 to Figure V. 29; depth values are referenced to the Mean Sea Level (MSL). 

Their interpretation must be performed taking into account that, in the area of less density 

of seismic lines, the data interpolation process is less reliable, and the results should be 

analysed with caution, in particular close to the edges of the study area. As expected, with 

a time-to-depth conversion using a layer-cake velocity model with constant velocities, the 

main shape of the observed features (structural highs and lows) are not highly affected 

(Figure V. 27; Figure V. 28; Figure V. 29). 

As mentioned before for the horizon time grids, in particular for the seabottom, SU-1, SU-

2, SU-3 and SU-4, and as expected for the depth maps, a depression is also observed in 

the NE corner of the study area suggesting, the existence an important fault. Once again, 

the low density of seismic lines at the edges of the study area influences negatively the 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

173 
 

grid interpolation and the conclusions for this area must be taken cautionsly. On the H5 

depth map, the higher values are registered (Figure V. 29).

To calculate the layer thicknesses, or the isopachs, for each stratigraphic unit, the depths 

of two consecutive seismic horizons were subtracted. The thickness of each seismic unit 

is presented in Figure V. 30; Figure V. 31; Figure V. 32. Thicknesses were only calculated 

in a smaller area, in which the available amount of data was acceptable. This calculation 

was limited to the area of higher seismic data coverage (the area around the Gran Burato 

feature) in order to have more accurate and reliable results. The evaluation of the 

thickness of each seismic unit allows us to identify where each stratigraphic unit is thicker 

or where it is thinner or absent, giving clues about the depositional environments of the 

study area.  

SU-1 (Figure V. 30) has approximate thicknesses between 180m and 600m. The lower 

values are observed near the Gran Burato, and this unit gets thicker along its flanks, in 

particular on the W side. The thickness of SU-2 (Figure V. 30) follows more or less the 

same pattern as SU-1 and its thickness ranges from 60m to 380m. This seismic unit 

seems to be locally thicker to the W and E of the Gran Burato area, and then decreases 

again. In both seismic units, their thicknesses decrease in the Gran Burato area (Figure V. 

30). SU-3 (Figure V. 31) has a very irregular thickness up to 480m across the entire study 

area. In the center of the study area this unit is not present. Westwards, the thickness of 

the SU-3 seems to increase. This irregular distribution, and the inexistence of this unit on 

some regions, is probably related to a strong erosion of this unit related with a tectonic 

uplift event. SU-4 (Figure V. 31) is one of the thickest stratigraphic units; it can reach the 

800m thick. However, these high values should be analyzed carefully because the seismic 

constrains in these areas are low. Around the Gran Burato SU-4 is not observed or is very 

thin, maybe due to erosion (Figure V. 31). SU-5, characterized by syn-rift deposits, has an 

estimated thickness between 130m and close to 1000m. Higher values (as 1000m) are 

obtained at the edges of the limited area, mainly because of the lack of information to 

perform a reasonable data interpolation; therefore they maybe be looked at with caution. 

SU-5 appears to be thinner around the Gran Burato area and thickening to its flanks 

(Figure V. 31). 

In summary, SU-1, SU-4 and SU-5 are the thickest stratigraphic sequences, reaching 

maximum thicknesses of around 600m, 800 and 1000m, respectively. SU-2 and SU-3 

show lower and more variables thicknesses, which may indicate periods of strong erosion 

after the deposition of these units.

V.3.4 Fault Interpretation 

In the scope of this thesis, the cartography and spatial correlation of the main faults that 

affect the study area were also performed, and the results are presented below. Twelve 

different main faults could be spatially correlated (Figure V. 33; Figure V. 34; Figure V.35): 

? Fault-1 (F1) and Fault-2 (F2), one at each flank of an important structural high 

(probably a basement horst or less likely a diapiric structure) below the Gran 

Burato; 

? Fault-3 to Fault-5 (F3-F5), to the W of this structural high; 

? Fault-6 (F6), to the E of this structural high; 

? Fault-GB1 (F-GB1) and Fault-GB2 (F-GB2), located on the Gran Burato area; 

? Fault-7 to Fault-8 (F7 to F8), to the N of the Gran Burato. 

? Fault-9 to Fault-10 (F9 to F10), to the S of the Gran Burato. 

 

The interpreted faults may be divided in three major families (Figure V. 33; Figure V. 34): 

(1)  NNW-SSE orientated faults – F1 to F6; 

(2)  WSW-ENE orientated faults – F-GB1 and F-GB2 

(3)  WNW-ESE orientated faults – F7 to F10 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

180 
 

F1 is a W-dipping normal fault which affects the entire interpreted stratigraphic units. This 

fault represents the W border of what seems to be a tectonic horst located on the center 

of the study area, below the Gran Burato area. Its origin is probably related with the rift 

episodes, since it affects the syn-rift sedimentary layers but may have suffered effects of 

the Cenozoic compression. This fault is observed in the majority of the W-E direction 

seismic profiles across the Gran Burato area (GB-07/10A/13/14/31/32/33). It reaches 

close to seafloor and extends with some confidence down to 2s (TWT). The larger 

extension of this fault probably indicates a reactivation of a major rift extensional fault 

during the Cenozoic compression. The East border of this tectonic horst is controlled by 

fault F2, which has a similar orientation to F1. F2 is an E-dipping fault, probably 

contemporaneous to F1, since it also affects all the stratigraphic sequence. This fault is 

also observed in all the W-E seismic profiles acquired around the Gran Burato, and its 

expression is the same as the F1 (it is observed close to the seafloor and can be followed 

down to approximate 2s (TWT); Figure V. 33). 

To the W of this horst, three main normal faults were interpreted - F3, F4 and F5 – which 

are parallel to the F1, and were probably originated at the same time, taking into account 

that they also affect the syn-rift deposits. However these three faults only cut the 

stratigraphic sequences below Seismic Unit 3 (SU-2 and SU-1 appear not affected by this 

fault). The F3 and F4 faults are observed in all the W-E seismic profiles across the Gran 

Burato region (GB-01/04/07/10A/13/14/30/31/32/33), while fault F5 was only interpreted 

on the seismic lines GB-14, GB-31, GB-32 and GB-33. All the three faults can be 

identified between 0.6s-0.8s (TWT) reaching down to 2s (TWT) below the seafloor. These 

normal faults control four half-graben structures clearly identified to the W of the main 

tectonic horst (Figure V. 33; Figure V.38). 

To the East side of the tectonic horst only one fault (F7) was mapped. This is a normal 

fault and seems to affects only the syn-rift deposits; therefore its origin is probably related 

with the rift episodes. F7 is also associated with the generation of half-graben structures. 

This fault is parallel to F2 and is observed between 0.7s to 2s (in TWT) below the 

seafloor. Following the interpretation presented here, this fault appears to be inactive at 

present, as it does not cut SU-1; its activity stopped somewhere after the main rift 

episodes (Figure V. 33). 

Two WSW-ENE orientated normal faults were also interpreted and spatially correlated – 

F-GB1 and F-GB2 (Figure V. 34). These two faults delimit the horst block located beneath 

the Gran Burato and is probably related to its origin. F-GB1 and F-GB2 appear to control 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey 

181 
 

this tectonic horst on its S and N flanks, respectively, while the faults F1 and F2 delimit its 

W and E flanks, respectively. Both faults were observed in some S-N seismic profiles 

(GB-24/25/27), affecting all the seismic stratigraphic units. These faults are not as deep as 

the previous ones, and can extend down to 1.5s (TWT) below the seafloor. These faults 

could explain the uplift of a tilted block below the Gran Burato favoring the observed 

elevation on the W side of this feature (Figure V. 34). This elevated block was interpreted 

as a probable diapir by Vázquez et al. (2009) and Ercilla et al., 2011. Although this 

interpretation cannot be completely rolled out, the interpretation preferred here is that it is 

most likely a tectonic horst induced by the combined activity of the faults F-GB1 and F-

GB2 (W-E), and F1 and F2 (N-S). Probably these faults were originated during the rifting 

episodes, and were later reactivated during the Cenozoic compressional episodes, since 

as described previously they affect the entire sedimentary record. 

Two WNW-ESE normal faults observed to the North of the ones described above were 

also spatially correlated - F7 (S-dipping) and F8 (N-dipping); they delimit a NW-SE horst 

similar to the one described above (below the Gran Burato). They can be identified 

between 0.3s to 1.5s below the seafloor, and they are also probably related to the rift 

episodes, since they appear to affect the syn-rift deposits. These faults do not affect the 

youngest sedimentary layers (Figure V. 34). The combined activity of these two faults (F7 

and F8) and F-GB1 and F-GB2 originated a graben between them, approximately 5km 

wide (Figure V.35; Figure V.36). 

To the South of fault F-GB-2 two more WNW-ESE normal faults were mapped (F9 and 

F10). These faults appear to be contemporaneous to the rift episodes since they are 

controlling the tilted blocks. They are observed between the 0.6s and the 1.5s below the 

seafloor. F9 and F10 probably stopped the activity sometime at the end of the deposition 

of SU-3 or close to the start of the SU-2 deposition, since this last unit is not affected by 

these two faults (Figure V. 34).  

The cartography of the main faults in the area with good seismic coverage allowed the 

creation of structural maps for the entire study area (Figure V.35; Figure V.36). The Gran 

Burato surface depression seems to be surrounded and controlled by normal faults, which 

are probably related to its origin and evolution (Figure V.36). 

All the spatially correlated faults seem to affect the deeper seismic stratigraphic units and 

the syn-rift sediments. The faults which were described as not affecting the upper 

sedimentary units are probably older or at least their activity is not observed at present. 

With the cartography of the main faults observed within the study area, two preliminary

and F8; GB – Gran Burato.

cross-sections (W-E; and S-N) models were built.These cross-sections show the overall 

structural style of the study area in  terms of faults, tilted blocks, and the deposition of the 

main stratigraphic units (Figure V.38; Figure V.39). 

In the NE part of the study area, there are evidences of an important fault, already 

mentioned above in section V.3.4. However, due to the lack of seismic coverage on this 

area this fault could not be mapped; it is possible to interpret it only on the seismic line 

GB-40 where it generates an important depression (Figure V.37). 

 

Figure V.37 – Seismic line GB-40, acquired in the Eastern part of the study area, where a big 

depression probably induced by the activity of a normal fault is observed (see text above; on the 

inset, the probable location of the red fault is represented by a red line). The color lines correspond 

to the interpreted seismic horizons: H1 – blue; H2 – yellow; H3 – green; H4 – dark blue; H5 – 

orange (vertical scale is in seconds - TWT). 

 

On the remaining study area, several other major and minor faults were also identified and 

interpreted as unassigned faults on each seismic section individually (see black line on 

the seismic profiles presented above); however due to the lower density of seismic lines in 

the areas farther away from the Gran Burato, at this stage, no reliable spatial correlation 

could be performed. 

The faults interpreted in the shallower areas of the seismic sections, affect mostly post-rift 

sedimentary units, especially SU-1, and are usually decoupled from the basement 

structures. However, some of these faults can be interpreted as being related to the 

reactivation of the basement faults. These upper faults are considered to be neotectonic

since they are younger, and affect mainly the youngest sedimentary layers. As concerning 

the faults that affect the basement, it is possible, considering the present day strss field in 

this region, that the WNW-ESE and WSW-ENE fault sets are now acting as strike-slip 

faults; however, the available seismic lines do not allow to confirm this hypothesis. 

 

V.3.5 Seismic Expression of Gas Accumulations and Leakage 

On the interpreted seismic lines, several possible evidences of fluid (most likely gas) 

migration and possible accumulations may be identified. These evidences can be 

interpreted both associated with the deeper stratigraphic units and with the shallower 

ones. Some of the identified leakage events have seafloor expression (e.g. pockmarks), 

while others were detected by changes in the amplitude content of the seismic data. This 

leakage and accumulations indicators may be related to the presence of hydrocarbon 

accumulations in the depth of interest. In order to help this preliminary analysis, the 

amplitude colorbar of the seismic display was modified so that it enhances the presence 

of amplitude anomalies. 

As already mentioned above, several pockmarks (crater-like depressions at the seabed 

formed by the expulsion of gas and/or pore-water from the sediments; Figure V.40) on the 

seafloor were identified on almost all the seismic profiles (see Figure V.9 above). These 

pockmarks are related to fluid seepage at the seabottom, which is probably migrating to 

the surface through faults which cross several sedimentary layers (Figure V.40). 

 

Figure V.40 - Conceptual model for pockmark formation: (A) accumulation of gas beneath the 
seabed and the excess pore fluid pressure may inflate the sediments to form a seabed dome.; (B) 
release of the gas in a single event which lifts the sediments into the water column; (C) the fine 
grained sediments are suspended in the water, and drift away by the currents (from Hovland and 
Judd, 1988). 

 

Examples of active and inactive pockmarks are found in many seismic lines from the 

study area (e.g. Figure V.41). Faults that cut Seismic Unit 1 seem to play an important 

role in the migration and escape of the fluids from depth to shallower levels since they are 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey  

189 
 

probably acting as gas migration conduits (Figure V.42). Seismic signal attenuation as 

well as high amplitude anomalies at the flanks of faults, or above, can indicate the 

presence of gas within the sediments. 

 

Figure V.41 – Seismic Line GB-24 shows high amplitude events pointed by the yellow arrows and 
by the red dotted circle (inset). In the inset high amplitude events, which may be related to 
hydrocarbon accumulations, are observed, as well as probable seafloor and buried pockmarks; the 
black dotted line represents a fault which could be acting as migration path for fluid flow (red dotted 
arrows) probably feeding the seafloor pockmark (vertical scale is seconds – TWT). 

 

Figure V.42 – Seismic Line GB-01 shows high amplitude events pointed by the yellow arrow and 
by the red dotted circles. On the inset two high amplitude events can be observed as well as some 
possible surface pockmarks at the seafloor; the black dotted lines represent some faults which may 
be acting as migration paths for fluid flow (red dotted arrows indicate the fluid movement) (vertical 
scale is seconds – TWT). 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

190 
 

In seismic line GB-04, it is possible to identify a high-amplitude pinch-out as the 

termination of Seismic Unit 3. This high amplitude content may be lithological dependent 

or on the other hand related with fluids accumulations at this stratigraphic level which is of 

particular interest, since it is located on the flanks of a structural high (Figure V.43). In the 

same seismic profile, closer to the seafloor, some high amplitudes events can also be 

identified. These events are probably associated with seepage or shallow gas 

accumulations, or gas-related carbonates, and related with pockmarks at the seafloor 

(Figure V.43). This type of event is also observed on other close seismic lines, like GB-16 

and GB-35. On the Northern part of GB-35 profile the SU-2 shows that it is possible to 

identify an amplitude anomaly which can be related with pockmarks on the seafloor 

immediately above it. In this section there are also evidences that fluids are migrating from 

the SU-2 and reaching the seafloor, through faults that cut the sedimentary records until 

the seafloor, originating pockmarks (see Figure V. 45). 

 

Figure V.43 – Seismic line GB-04, South of the Gran Burato, shows high amplitude pinch-outs 
corresponding to SU-3. The two insets shows locations of interest: red box – high amplitudes 
located on a structural high and a amplitude anomaly that stops against a fault; yellow box – 
seafloor pockmarks maybe generated by the migration of gas (red arrows) through the faults (black 
dotted lines) (vertical scale is seconds – TWT). 



Chapter V. Seismic Data Interpretation of the BURATO4240 Survey  

191 
 

In the Eastern part of this seismic profile, a strong reflection, which seems to be 

constrained between faults, is observed and may be related with fluid accumulation 

(Figure V.44). 

 

Figure V.44 – Seismic Line GB-01 shows high amplitude events response within SU-2 (pointed by 
the red arrows and circles) and SU-3 (represented by green dotted circles) (vertical scale is 
seconds – TWT). 

 

In the study area, several other very large negative structures, similar to the Gran Burato 

can also be found. On the seismic line GB-35 (Figure V. 45), a very peculiar feature was 

identified (Feature A with about 13km
2
). It is still unknown if it is related to gas seepage or 

not, but it looks like a buried large pockmark similar to it. Some strong amplitude above it 

and faults which could be acting as gas paths, support this interpretation. Several 

pockmarks are also identified on this same profile. In the center part of this section, strong 

amplitudes on SU-2 are probably related to gas or fluids accumulation (Figure V. 45). The 

presence of seafloor pockmarks above this potential accumulation, where the fault density 

is higher, also supports this idea.  

Another similar structure to the Gran Burato is also found in the Southern part of the 

seismic line GB-36, in the Southern part of the study area (Feature B, with about 

28km
2
), which appears to be controlled by two faults (Figure V. 46). On the 

northern part of the section, SU-2 is represented by strong amplitudes. Across this 

seismic profile several seabed pockmarks can also be identified (Figure V. 46). 

Near the Gran Burato, several disrupted seismic events with high amplitude are also 

observed (Figure V. 47). This could indicate that the much part of the gas which may be 

accumulated within this area, in the past, probably escaped during the formation of this 

large and singular structure. A preliminary hypothesis for the evolution of this structure 



Multichannel Seismic Investigation of the Gran Burato area, off W Galicia 

192 
 

may be related to the fast release of a huge amount of gas which was accumulated within 

the sediments, on the flanks of structural high beneath the Gran Burato. 

 

Figure V. 45 – Seismic Line GB-35 shows several pockmarks at the seafloor probably generated 
by gas seepage coming from depth; a potential source are the high amplitudes in SU-3 (red dotted 
circle). In the Southern part of the seismic profile, a depression similar to the Gran Burato can also 
be observed (Feature A; vertical scale is seconds – TWT). 

 

 

Figure V. 46 – Seismic Line GB-36 shows high amplitude events pointed by the red dotted circles. 
In the Southern part of the seismic profile a depression similar to the Gran Burato is observed 

(Feature B) (vertical scale is seconds – TWT). 

 

These seafloor depressions, Feature A and Feature B, are very similar to the Gran 

Burato, and so they can be described as very large pockmarks. The Gran Burato and the 

Feature A seem to be aligned with the NW-SE fracture trends observed in the study area 

(Figure V.48).

Figure V. 47 – Part of the seismic profiles GB-07 and GB-21 showing the area around the Gran 
Burato. No noticeable evidences of gas or fluids accumulations are observed; this could indicate 
that the gas that accumulated in this area was already escaped during the formation of the Gran 
Burato (vertical scale is seconds – TWT).

As previously discussed there are some possible evidences of gas accumulations. The 

faults which affect the deeper units have probably acted as conduits for the fluid migration 

(most likely gas), from deeper to shallower levels. Within SU-2 and SU-3 several possible 

evidences of gas, represented by strong amplitudes anomalies, were observed. Thus, 

these two seismic units are or particular interest since they might be responsible for the 

potential accumulation of hydrocarbons in this region. The high fault density observed in 

certain areas above these units would facilitate the fluids migration through the 

sedimentary layers. 

In summary, the 2D seismic sections shown in this section illustrate the structural and 

stratigraphic style of potential hydrocarbon accumulation sites. These potential 

accumulation sites are related with 3 and 4-way dip closure structures, associated with the 

structural highs that can be found within the study area, and with the pinch-outs 

terminations of SU-2 and SU-3. The potential stratigraphic accumulations, the pinch-out, 

are mainly associated with SU-2 and SU-3, and in most cases are located in the flanks of 

important structural highs and have high amplitude content. For this reason, these two 

stratigraphic units are probably the most promissory, concerning potential hydrocarbons 

accumulation. 

 

V.3.6 Genesis of the Gran Burato 

The formation of the Gran Burato is probably related to the Cenozoic compressive regime 

associated with the accumulations of fluids (most probably gas) in the sedimentary 

sequence. The original extensional rift faults, some of which were probably reactivated 

during the Cenozoic compression, probably acted as migration paths for the gas through 

the sedimentary layers (Figure V.49). During the Cenozoic compression, the upper 

sedimentary layers in the study area were highly folded and fractured; in particular, the 

areas on top of structural highs were the most affected, and highly fractured zones were 

created at the fold axis (II in Figure V.49). In fact, the Gran Burato is located on top of a 

structural high, probably a reactivated basement horst. The faults which control this 

tectonic horst had probably acted as active migration paths for the gas, which was being 

accumulated in these highly fractured zones, with the sediments becoming more and 

more fluidized, increasing the fluids pressure in this zones which may inflate the 

sediments to form a seabed dome (III in Figure V.49). Due to the continue accumulations 

of gas in these fractured zones, the fluidification and remobilization of the sediments 

occur, and crater-like structures are then created (III in Figure V.49).

Figure V.49 – Genetic and evolutionary model of the Gran Burato: I - rotated blocks, horst and half-graben 

structures created during the main rifting phases, and post-rift parallel sedimentation without relevant tectonic 
movement; II – the Cenozoic compression regime due to the Africa-Eurasia convergence have generated 
fractured sedimentary sequences and asymmetric folds; III – highly fractured zones created on top of 
structural highs of the basement and at the fold axis; faults acting as migration paths for the gas (red coloured 
faults; blue arrows), which is accumulated in these highly fractured zones fluidificating the sediments (green 
dotted box): a) pressure build up phase - fluids (most likely gas) migration through the faults and excess of 
gas accumulations beneath the seafloor with the possible formation of a seabed dome; b) and c) the 
gas/sediment expulsion phase – release of the gas which lifts the sediments into the water; the fine-grained 
sediments are suspended in the water and are drifted away by the currents; the influence of the gas hydrates 
dissociation may have been presented in these stages; d) a seafloor crater is created (model according to 
Hovland and Judd, 1988); IV – large depressions are created in the seafloor, such as the Gran Burato. The 
seismic profiles represent the different stages presented in II, III and IV, which are observed in different 
locations of the study area; vertical scale in seconds (TWT).

As the gas migration still occurs, these crater zones will increase in size, becoming larger 

and deeper, while the fluidification and remobilization processes of the sediments are 

taking place (III in Figure V.49). These sediments are lifted into the water column and 

drifted away by the currents (III in Figure V.49). A large crater in the seafloor, such as the 

Gran Burato, is then created (IV in Figure V.49). Therefore, the Gran Burato was probably 

originated by several episodes of gas extrusion, which was being accumulated in the 

sedimentary sequences, causing the continous remobilization of the seafloor sediments. 

A question that needs to be addressed is the triggering mechanism for the origin of the 

giant pockmarks observed in this area. Tectonics and faulting certainly had an important 

role in gas migration and formation of conduits for the gas escape. However, gas hydrate 

dissociation could have been the triggering mechanism. At this depth and given the 

presence of gas in the sediments, the formation and existence of gas hydrates was almost 

sure. The dissociation of these gas hydrates induced by several factors (e.g. climate 

changes, sudden pressure release by faulting, or others) would have strongly fluidized the 

sediments. Therefore, the presence and dissociation of gas hydrates may have been an 

important factor in the formation of these giant pockmarks, such as the Gran Burato. 

The preliminary genetic and evolutionary model shown in Figure V.49 can explain the 

possible formation of this outstanding feature. However, more geological and geophysical 

data are needed to confirm and detail this preliminary model proposed for the formation of 

the Gran Burato.

Chapter VI. Conclusions 
 

 

A detailed seismic data processing is the best method to improve the resolution of the 

seismic sections, increasing substantially their quality. The application of suitable seismic 

processing flows in the scope of this work made possible the improvement of the 

preliminary processing of the 2D multichannel seismic lines acquired during the 

BURATO4240 cruise. The application of leading industry processing techniques such as 

pre-stack time migration and bandwidth extension, allowed the improvement of the 

onboard seismic processing, and to obtain good quality final seismic sections. 

The re-processing of the multichannel seismic lines was essential for the seismic 

interpretation work, in particular for the interpretation of the faults and of the deeper 

seismic-stratigraphic units. The seismic-stratigraphic sequences described in the literature 

were identified on the seismic sections studied and correlated across the study area. 

Several rotated blocks associated with listric faults related to the Atlantic rift episodes 

were clearly observed on the seismic profiles, in particular on the W-E profiles. 

A satisfactory, but still preliminary, structural interpretation of the study area was obtained, 

which contributes to a better knowledge about the possible formation of the Gran Burato, 

and the underlying geology. The Gran Burato is located above a tectonic horst delimited 

by two major faults, which were reactivated during the Alpine orogeny. These and other 

faults could be mapped and correlated across the study area. However, to increase the 

detail of the presented structural map, higher density of seismic data is required to make 

possible the correlation in areas where this density is lower. 

The origin of the Gran Burato seems to be related to major episodes of gas expulsion. 

These episodes have lifted the overlying sediments into the water column which were 

drifted away probably by bottom currents, creating this outstanding depression at the 

seafloor. This gas probably accumulated in the sediments at depth, created overpressure 

and migrated through the faults to the uppermost stratigraphic sequences and to the 

seafloor. The weaker evidence of the presence of gas or other fluids below and in the 

immediate vicinity of the Gran Burato seems to support the idea that the majority of the 

gas in this area has already escaped, probably during the formation of this very large 

pockmark.

Two features similar to the Gran Burato are also observed to the South of it .These two 

seafloor depressions are also very large pockmarks and most likely have a similar origin 

to the Gran Burato. However, horizontal reflectors probably caused by pelagic 

sedimentation inside these two structures indicate its present day inactivity. Inside the 

Gran Burato these horizontal reflections are not observed, which might be related to a 

present-day activity or a recent activity of fluid or gas escape. A possible explanation is 

the fault-control activity of these pockmark structures which were activated/originated from 

South to North, the Gran Burato being the most recent one; this would explaind why thus 

feature is not yet filled with sediments. Alternatively, some gas escape could still be taking 

place. 

A preliminary interpretation of possible evidences of gas or other fluids accumulations and 

leakage were performed is the scope of this work, and several amplitude anomalies were 

identified. These amplitudes anomalies were mainly observed within the Seismic Unit 2 

and Seismic Unit 3, and could be related to the presence of fluid or gas within the 

sediments, or to the lithologies or characteristics of these units. A detailed approach using 

seismic attributes to determine the possible gas or fluids accumulation, and to detect 

possible zones of hydrocarbon accumulation, is a future approach to perform on this 

dataset (a preliminary work on this subject was already perfomed by L. Azevedo at the 

University of Aveiro). 

In order to extend this research and to support some of the conclusions of this work, a 

new seismic dataset needs to be acquired in the areas with lower density data coverage. 

In fact, another scientific survey – the Gran Burato 2011 cruise – was just carried out in 

this study area in August 2011, in the scope of the same research project, increasing the 

seismic data coverage in this area; the author also participated in this cruise. The 

processing and interpretation of this new 2D multichannel seismic dataset will provide 

essential information to support some of the conclusions already presented, to continue 

this research work in this area, and also to extend this research to a larger area. 

Future work on this subject should also include a detailed AVO processing stage, in order 

to further investigate the existence of gas, and the application of seismic attributes to 

study the variability and dimensions of these accumulations. The structural map already 

presented should be extended to a larger area to better understand which were the 

important events related to the origin of the Gran Burato and associated features. The 

new dataset acquired in 2011, will certainly represent a solid base to support and to 

continue this investigation.

Appendix – SPW Calculations 
 

 

In this Appendix, two important calculations performed during the seismic data processing 

work in SPW using Trace Header Cell Math operations are described: (i) the manual 

calculation of the SuperGathers, necessary for the velocity analysis, and (ii) the 

calculations to order by offset the seismic file, in order to be able to apply the Radon 

Demultiple process. 

 

A.I SuperGathers 

In order to compute the SuperGather the range of CMP locations of the seismic file must 

be known. This will allow the selection of a desirable CMP range, in order to have the 

maximum fold, and the maximum resolution. 

As example, the seismic line GB-23 was selected, in which the CMP location ranges 

between 965 and 2435. The borders ones are rejected because they don’t have the 

maximum fold (maximum coverage). Therefore, the CMP locations between 1000-2400 

were chosen. The desired is to have CMP starting on 1000, incrementing of 50, until 

2400. 

The first Trace Header Cell Math will subtract to each CMP location 975 and the result is 

demonstrated in Figure A. 1.

Next, with another Trace Header Cell Math, the value of CMP Locaton is divided by the 

shooting spacing, 50m (Figure A. 2).

The next Trace Header Cell Math will select just the integer part of each CMP Location 

(Figure A. 3).

After this, the next Trace Header Cell Math is applied to multiply every CMP Location by 

the shooting spacing, 50m. Notice that now we have CMP Location starting with zeros 

and increasing by 50 (Figure A. 4).

The last Trace Header Cell Math will perform the summing of the CMP Location, by the 

value of the first CMP Location desirable, 1000 (Figure A. 5).

Finally, completing this processing sequence it is applied an Automatic Gain Control in 

order to increase the deeper amplitudes events (Figure A. 6). 

 

Figure A. 6 - Automatic Gain Control processing. 

 

The final result is a CMP Location sequence starting in 1000, increasing by 50, and 

finishing on 2400, and, more important, each new CMP Location is now a sum of old CMP 

location. The intended increase of the fold was accomplished. The total processing flow 

for the SuperGathers computation is presented in Figure A. 7.

A.II Offset-Ordered Seismic File 

In order to compute an offset-ordered seismic file, a sequence of Trace Header Column 

Math and Trace Header Cell Math card was built. The objective of these headers 

operations was to have an offset gather at each CMP Position, in order to increase the 

resolution. This offset-ordered processing sequence is a requirement in the Radon 

Demultiple application. 

In the beginning, a Trace Header Column Math card was used to copy the original offset 

values to another header field, to preserve the original offset data (Figure A. 8). The 

second operation is performed using a Trace Header Cell Math card, to convert the offset 

values to absolute values (Figure A. 9). 

 

Figure A. 8 – Trace Header Column Column Math processing (Nº1) carried out during the Radon 
Demultiple processing flow. 

 
Figure A. 9 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº2) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 
processing flow.

The next operation consists in the subtraction to the Offset a value, in order to get the 

Offset values increasing by the CMP spacing value. In other words, as the Source-

Receiver Offset was 186.7m and the CMP spacing was 6.25m, a value of 180.45m is 

subtracted to the offset for each CMP position (186.7m - 180.45m = 6.25m) (Figure A. 10).  

 

Figure A. 10 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº3) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 
processing flow. 

 

The next step, using another Trace Header Cell Math card is to divide the Offset header 

field by the double of the shot interval (100m) (Figure A. 11). 

 

Figure A. 11 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº4) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 

processing flow. 



Appendix – SPW Calculations. 

 

213 
 

On the next operation, only the integer part is kept on the Header Field (Figure A. 12)  

 

Figure A. 12 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº5) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 
processing flow. 

 

After this operation, we multiply the Offset by 100m (Figure A. 13), and then we sum the 

value of the real Source-Receiver Offset, 186.7m (Figure A. 14). 

 

 

Figure A. 13 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº6) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 
processing flow.

Figure A. 14 – Trace Header Cell Math processing (Nº7) carried out during the Radon Demultiple 
processing flow. 

 

With this header field math sequence, we will have at least one offset gather in each CMP 

location. In the most of the cases, we will get the same CMP in 8 different locations. This 

offset modification is just temporally. After the Radon Demultiple processing the original 

offsets, previously stored in another header field, are loaded again (see Section IV.3.2 – 

Flow6). The last operation is the saving of the Offsets modification on another header field 

(Figure A. 15).

Demultiple processing flow.
