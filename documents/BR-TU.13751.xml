resumo 

 

Pseudomonas; Bacillus licheniformis; estirpes indutoras; ramnolipidos; 

surfactina 

 

Os biossurfactantes (BSF) são compostos anfipáticos produzidos por uma 

vasta gama de microorganismos. São capazes de reduzir a tensão superficial 

e interfacial, bem como emulsificar e transportar substratos hidrofóbicos, 

regular a aderência de células a superficies e interferir com o desenvolvimento 

de biofilmes. Os BSF encontram aplicações nas mais diversas áreas, 

nomeadamente nas indústrias alimentar e do petróleo, no controle de biofilmes 

microbianos e na prevenção da biocorrosão, biofouling e desenvolvimento de 

biofilmes. são ainda usados como ingredientes em produtos terapêuticos, de 

cuidado pessoal e cosméticos.  

Os BSF representam uma alternativa vantajosa aos surfactantes químicos 

porque são menos tóxicos, mais biodegradáveis e estáveis em temperaturas e 

pH extremos. Contudo, a sua produção e aplicação é limitada devido pelo 

baixo rendimento do processo produtivo e pelos elevados custos de produção. 

Considerando que os BSF são metabolitos secundários, a hipótese de que a o 

co-cultivo com estirpes produtoras de biofilme (indutoras) estimula a síntese de 

BSF foi testada. Estirpes de Bacillus licheniformis e Pseudomonas sp 

produtoras de BSF foram co cultivadas com estirpes indutoras (Pseudomonas 

aeruginosa e Listeria innocua) de maneira a estimular a produção de surfactina 

e ramnolípidos, respetivamente. As culturas axénicas e co-culturas foram 

testadas quanto ao efeito tensioativo, pelo método do oil spray, cultivo em 

meio CTAB-azul de metileno e cultivo em meio agar de sangue. O método 

CPC-BTB foi usado para quantificação de surfatina e ramnolípidos, ambos 

surfactantes aniónicos, e o método de orcinol foi usado para a quantificação de 

ramnolípidos. O efeito das culturas e co-culturas na inibição de quorum 

sensing em Chromobacterium violaceum foi também avaliada. 

Os resultados do método CPC-BTB indicaram que a estimulação de produção 

de BSF em Pseudomonas #74 foi maior em co-cultura com L. innocua. Os 

resultados do teste do CTAB-azul de metileno indicaram que a produção de 

BSF em B. licheniformis foi mais estimulada em co-cultivo com P. aeruginosa. 

Não se verificaram diferenças significativas no efeito tensioativo avaliado pelos 

métodos do oil spray, colapso da gota cultivo emagar de sangue, nem pelo 

método quantitativo do orcinol. 

Os resultados indicam que o co-cultivo afecta a concentração de BSF, embora 

não existam diferenças no efeito tensioactivo, e que um maior rendimento de 

produção pode ser obtido através da seleção das estirpes indutoras 

adequadas.

Biosurfactants (BSF) are amphipathic compounds, produced by a vast range of 

microorganisms. They are able to reduce surface and interfacial tensions, as 

well as to emulsify and transport hydrophobic substrates, to regulate cell 

adherence to surfaces and to interfere biofilm development.  

BSF can have applications in diverse areas, such as petroleum and food 

industries, control of biofouling and biofilm development, and are also used as 

ingredients in therapeutic formulations, personal care products, and cosmetics. 

They represent an advantageous alternative to chemical surfactants because 

they less toxic, highly biodegradable and stable in extreme temperature and 

pH. However, mass production and application of BSF is still limited by the low 

production yield and high production costs.  

Considering that BSF are secondary metabolites, the hypothesis that co-

cultivation with biofilm-forming strains would induce BSF synthesis was tested. 

BSF producing strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Pseudomonas sp. were 

cultivated with inducing strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria 

innocua) as a way to stimulate the production of surfactin and rhamnolipids, 

respectively.   

Axenic cultures and co-cultures were tested as to the tensoactive effect by the 

oil spray method, cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue medium, cultivation in 

blood agar, and the drop collapse assay. The CPC-BTB method was used for 

the quantification of surfactin and rhamnolipids, both anionic surfactants, and 

the orcinol method for the quantification of rhamnolipids. Effect of the cultures 

and co-cultures in the quorum sensing inhibition in Chromobacterium 

violaceum culture was also evaluated. 

Results of the CPC-BTB test indicate that the stimulation of BSF production by 

Pseudomonas sp. was the highest in co-cultures with Listeria innocua. The 

results of the CTAB-methylene blue test indicate that BSF production in B. 

licheniformis was more stimulated by co-cultivation with P. aeruginosa. There 

were no significant differences in the tensoactive effect of the cell-free extracts 

as determined by oil spray, the drop-collapse test or by the blood-agar test.  

The results indicate that co-cultivation affects the concentration of BSF, 

although it does not have an effect in the tensioactive effect of the BSF, and 

that higher production yields can be attained by selecting convenient inducer 

strains.

1. Introduction 

 

1.1. Surfactants and biosurfactants 

 

Chemical surfactants have had a major role in everyday life for more than a 

century, although their commercial success has only been increasing over the last 

few decades. It has become a quickly evolving and profitable field, related with 

innumerous applications such as detergency and emulsification, biofilm control, 

health and personal care products and environmental restoration and protection(1–6). 

Surfactants, or surface active agents, are amphiphilic molecules with 

hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups that allows them to interact with different gas, 

solid and liquid interfaces. They are capable of reducing surface and interfacial 

tension, as well as to emulsify immiscible fluids (2,3,7). Surface tension refers to the 

force that is wielded by a liquid solution when interacting with a solid or liquid. 

Interfacial tension is mainly the intermolecular force exerted by the molecules of 

liquid, when the interfacial tension of a solution is low, it can be easily emulsified (8,9) 

The rapid rise of the surfactant market in recent years, and the fact that 70-

75% of the surfactants currently commercialized in developed countries have a 

petrochemical source, has triggered an eager search for more viable and 

environmentally friendly alternatives (2,3,10). 

Biosurfactants (BSFs) are surfactants produced extracellularly, or as a cell 

membrane component, by a wide range of microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts 

and fungi (11,12). They are usually secondary metabolites, produced at the end of the 

exponential phase or the beginning of the stationary phase. Structurally, they have 

similarities with their chemical counterparts, containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic 

domains. The hydrophobic tail is composed mainly of acids, peptides or 

polysaccharides, while the hydrophilic moiety comprehends mostly hydrocarbon 

chains or fatty acids (6,8,13).The typical BSF structure can be observed in figure 1

In liquid solutions, BSFs can aggregate and form structures known as micelles, 

in which the hydrophobic groups are protected from contacting with the aqueous 

phase. Micelles can have various forms, depending on the BSF, and are affected by 

temperature, pressure and presence of electrolytes. The concentration value at which 

micelles are formed is denominated critical micelle concentration (CMC) and it 

corresponds to the value at which the ability of the BSF to reduce surface tension is 

considered efficient. Lower CMC values, usually mean a higher efficiency of the BSF 

(3). The general structure of a micelle structure can be observed in figure 2. 

 

Figure 2. Micelles structure adapted from Malik et. al (2011) 

 

BSFs present several advantages over chemical surfactants, such as low 

toxicity, higher biodegradability and higher stability in extreme conditions of 

temperature, pH and salinity. They can also be synthesized from renewable sources 

such as ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils and wastewater (1,7,11).

However, the cost of their production at an industrial scale is still very high, and 

so, there has been an increasing search for optimization in the cultivation processes 

of BSF producing microorganisms, in an effort to increasing their production yield and 

lower their production cost (12,14). 

 

1.2. Surfactant producing microorganisms 

 

Bacteria are known to exhibit physiological and chemical adaptations when 

presented with extreme conditions or stress. In some of those cases, they produce 

secondary metabolites, such as BSFs (15). BSFs can reduce surface and interfacial 

tension and solubilize hydrocarbons, which facilitates the microorganism growth in 

those substrates. BSFs can also interfere in the regulation of bacterial population 

density and cell to cell communication (2,11,16). BSF producing bacteria are able to 

inhabit the most diverse habitats, whether terrestrial, aquatic or extreme conditions. 

They are most likely found in areas with high levels of hydrocarbons or organic 

residues, such as industrial zones, oil reservoirs, petroleum exploration areas and oil 

contaminated site (17–22)  

Some Bacillus, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas strains have been shown to 

grow and produce BSF successfully in extreme environmental conditions, with 

temperatures ranging from 55-70 ºC, as well as high levels of salinity, from 10-15 % 

(23,24). Recently, some Pseudomonas strains originating from floral nectar, a sugar-

rich matrix, were observed to thrive and produce BSF, that further demonstrates the 

ability of BS-producing microorganisms to inhabit the most unusual microniches (25). 

While bacterial production of BSFs is already an extensively studied field, there 

are still few fungi reported to produce BSFs. Some Candida strains, as well as 

Aspergillus ustrus, Ustilago maydis and Rhodococcus erythropolis are some of the 

few reported to produce (26–29). Table 1 presents some of the most common BSF 

producing microorganisms and their respective BSF.

1.3. Regulation of biosurfactant production 

 

The production of BSF is, to some extent, depending on cell-to-cell 

communication mediated by chemical signals, a process designated by quorum 

sensing (QS). QS is the regulation of gene expression, as a result of changes in the 



7 
 

cell population density and it was first described in the marine Gram negative bacteria 

bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi (30). Bacteria produce and 

release chemical molecules, known as autoinducers, that increase in concentration 

as the cell population density also increases. When a minimal threshold concentration 

of autoinducers is reached, bacterial gene expression is altered and a change in 

phenotype occurs. QS communication is known to control some physiological 

activities such as symbiosis, virulence, competence, antibiotic production and biofilm 

formation (31). Both Gram positive and gram negative bacteria are capable of QS, 

although using different systems to do so. Generally, Gram positive bacteria use 

oligopeptides as autoinducers and gram negative bacteria use acylated homoserine 

lactones (32,33) 

Some molecules, known as quorum quenchers, are known to interfere in the 

QS process and can, therefore, be used to inhibit this intercellular communication 

between bacteria. An example of this quorum quenching effect, is the synthesis of the 

purple pigment violacein in Chromobacterium violaceum that is regulated by QS. As a 

result of the inhibition of QS, the violet phenotype of the colonies is lost (34). 

 

 

1.4. Methods for detection and quantification of biosurfactants 

 

There are a number of different methodologies to detect and quantify the 

production of BSF and they can be divided into indirect methods, colorimetric 

methods and molecular methods.  

The indirect methods rely mostly in the physical properties of the BSFs and 

may or may not be quantitative. 

? Drop collapse assay: an easily performed method where a drop of cell 

suspension or surfactant sample is placed on an oil/water surface. The drops 

containing BSF will collapse, while the BSF free ones will continue to be stable 

(35). It is a semi-qualitative method and the diameter of the final drop allows, 



8 
 

indirectly, to calculate the BSF concentration. Nevertheless, it can lead to false 

negatives, if the producing strain produces a low amount of BSF (35,36). 

? Oil spray method: an expedite assay involving atomized oil, that allows for the 

detection of BSF produced by colonies developing on solid culture medium. 

Using an airbrush, the colonies are sprayed with a fine layer of oil and BSF can 

immediately be detected by the formation of halos around producing colonies. 

This method may be performed on multiple colonies at the same time, and 

permits the detection of lower BSF concentrations than the drop collapse 

assay (35,37). 

? Hemolysis: In a solid medium containing 5% blood, BSF production can be 

detected by the partial or total hemolysis of red blood cells. This hemolytic 

activity is due to the ability of BSF to disrupt the cell membrane (38). However, 

this method is considered unreliable, as hemolysis may be the result of 

enzymes, such as lysozyme and, on the other hand, not all biosurfactants 

display hemolytic activity (39,40). 

? Emulsifcation index: This method is performed by adding hydrocarbons to the 

BSF producing bacteria culture. The culture is then centrifuged and laid to rest 

for 24h. If there is presence of BSF, a layer between the hydrocarbon and the 

liquid culture will appear. Then, the emulsification index is calculated by 

dividing the height of the emulsification layer by the total height (41).  

 

Colorimetric methods are based on the binding of a dye to the BSF or a specific 

part of the BSF molecule. They are specific for different BSF groups. 

? CTAB-methylene blue: A test that is mostly used for the detection of 

rhamnolipids, it is based on the binding of the rhamnolipids (anionic 

surfactants) to Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide CTAB (cationic surfactant), 

in the presence of methylene blue, as a color indicator (42,43). The 

appearance of dark halos around in the cultures, in TSA containing CTAB and 

methylene blue, confirms the presence of the BSF and the halos diameter can 

be measured to give a relative concentration of BSF. However, the halos can 



9 
 

be affected by various factors like incubation time, temperature, rhamnolipids 

migration form the cell and the cellular growth phase (44). 

? CPC-BTB: This is an innovative highly precise method, that is used to quantify 

surfactin in high production yield cultures (surfactin concentration around 100-

500mg/L). A green complex, formed by CPC (cetilpiridinium chloride), as a 

mediator, and BTB (bromotimol blue), as color indicator is used and in the 

presence of surfactin, CPC is removed from the CPC-BTB complex, creating a 

chromatic shift from light green to dark green and blue. This is due to the free 

BTB molecules, after release from the CPC-BTB complex. The optical density 

may also be observed (600 nm) for quantification of BSF (45). 

? Orcinol method: This is the standard method to specifically quantify 

rhamnolipids. It is based on the extraction of the BSF and consequently acidic 

hydrolysis with a orcinol reagent (3-5 dihydroxitoluene and sulfuric acid), in 

order to release rhamnose, which is later quantified by spectroscopy (OD 420 

nm) (39,46). 

 

Molecular methods are usually based on chromatography and spectrometry. 

They allow the quantification, purification and identification of the BSF structure. 

Although they are highthroughput methods, they present high costs (9,46,47).  

Chromatography methods rely on chromatic separation of the BSF and are 

usually coupled with mass spectrometry. The most used chromatography in BSF 

identification is the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is the 

most efficient method for BSF identification and quantification (39).  

Spectrometry methods are usually mass spectrometry, that can be used 

without a previous chromatography (46).  

 

1.5. Classification of bacterial surfactants 

 

Bacterial surfactants are classified accordingly to their chemical structure, 

microbial origin and molecular weight (2,7). Based on their chemical composition, 



10 
 

they are distributed in 4 classes: glycolipids; lipopeptides and lipoproteins, 

phospholipids and fatty acids, polymeric and particulate surfactants (2,11,48). 

According to their molecular weight, they can divided in biosurfactants and 

bioemulsifiers. Biosurfactants generally have low molecular weight and are capable of 

lowering surface and interfacial tension. Bioemulsifiers refer mainly to high molecular 

weight BSFs, and have a major role in the binding and detachment of bacteria to 

surfaces as well as emulsification of hydrocarbons (8,9,49). Biossurfactants are 

usually able of emulsification as well. Bioemulsifiers, however, do not typically reduce 

surface and interfacial tension (50). 

Glycolipids (rhamnolipids) and lipopeptides (surfactin and liquenisin) are two of 

the most important and well characterized classes of bacterial biossurfantants. 

Rhamnolipids are BSFs of the glycolipid family. Their production was first described in 

P. aeruginosa and they are comprised by one or two molecules of L-rhamnose linked 

to one or two monomers of ?-hydroxy fatty acid, as shown in figure 1 (2,10,51). There 

are at least 28 rhamnolipid homologues, with four of them (R1, R2, R3 e R4) being 

the most predominant. A typical structure of a mono and di-rhamnolipid can be 

observed in figure 4. The homologues differ mainly in the concentration of rhamnose 

molecules (one or two) and in the length of fatty acid chain (between 8 and 12 

carbons) (52).

Rhamnolipids play various roles in the physiology of the producing 

microorganism. Their main functions appear to be the solubilization and the uptake of 

hydrocarbons, antimicrobial activity, as to compete with neighboring microorganisms 

and mediation in cell attachment and detachment to surfaces (10,20,54). Rhamnolipid 

production is dependent on quorum sensing signaling and in extreme conditions, 

such as lack of nutrients, there is an increasing production of rhamnolipid, which can 

then be used as nutrients themselves (55,56). One of the main concerns in the 

rhamnolipid production remains the fact that the one of the most prominent 

producers, P. aeruginosa, includes highly pathogenic strains. However, recent studies 

have demonstrated that different Pseudomonas species, such as P. putida and P. 

chlororaphis are also able to produce rhamnolipids (20,56). 

Surfactin and lichenisin are BSFs from the lipopeptide family and are mainly 

produced by Bacillus species. They are known to interfere in the 

attachment/detachment of the microorganism to surfaces, due to their ability to alter 

the hydrophobicity of the bacterial membrane (57,58). Surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide, 

containing seven aminoacids linked to a ?-hydroxy fatty acid chain by a lactone 

bridge, as shown in figure 4. Surfactin exhibits remarkable surficial activity, and it is 

capable of lowering the water surface tension from 72 to 27 Mn/m in a 20 µM 

concentration (59,60). There are different surfactin homologues, depending on the 

number of carbons on the fatty acid chain (13 to 15), as well as on the composition of 

aminoacids in the peptide sequence. These modifications may alter the BSF activity 

(58,61).

Lichenisin is a cyclic lipopeptide with seven aminoacids structurally similar to 

surfactin. The main difference between the two BSFs resides in the presence of a 

residue, glutaminyl, instead of a glutamic acid in the first position. This difference 

makes it possible for lichenisin to have a lower CMC and higher surfactant power and 

hemolytic activity (62). 

 

1.6. Applications of biosurfactants and biosurfactant-producing 

microorganisms 

 

BSFs have a myriad of applications in various areas, like petroleum recovery, 

food industry, cosmetics, detergents, pharmaceutics and paints (14). Their capability 

to emulsify, and dissolve hydrocarbons and oils, makes them a remarkable resource 

in bioremediation in oil contaminated areas(16,17,63,64).  

Bioremediation relies on the natural capacity of plants and microorganisms to 

degrade contaminants, turning them into less toxic or completely convert them to 

nontoxic substances, like water and carbon dioxide (14). A natural and inexpensive 

way to increase bioremediation of contamnated areas relies on biostimulation. This 

may be achieved through the increase of nutrients and oxygen. However, it is crucial 

to know beforehand the population density as well as the concentration of oil, and the 

correct pH in order to have a successful bioremediation effect (17,64). Another way to 

increase the bioremediation success is bioaugmentation, in which the concentration 

of natural microorganisms inhabiting the contaminated area is increased to accelerate 

the process (14). 

BSFs can also be useful in the washing of oil reservoirs and in the microbial 

enhanced oil recovery technology (MEOR). The oil residue that is trapped in the small 

pores of rocks, is thought to represent 50-65% of the oil and it is kept there by 

elevated capillary forces and interfacial tension between the oil and the aqueous 

phase. MEOR employs microorganisms and their respective BSF to reduce the 

interfacial tension between the rock and oil, allowing the oil to move freely through the 

rock pores and reach the surface with ease (64–66). 



13 
 

Due to their ionic nature, BSF can also perform a major role in the removal of 

heavy metals from soil and sediments. Solutions of surfactants can be used for the 

solubilisation and dispersion of the contaminants, and also allow the reuse of the soil 

(67). By adding the BSF solution to the soil, the heavy metals are trapped in BSFs 

micelles by electrostatic interactions and are easily retrieved by precipitation or 

membrane separation (14). Recent studies put surfactin, rhamnolipids and 

sophorolipids as the most promising candidates to heavy metal removal by BSFs 

(68,69). There has also been some recent studies with Candida strains, mainly C. 

lipolytica, that demonstrate that the produced BSF can remove up to 96% of Zn and 

Cu, in groundwater (70). 

Although it is known that BSFs play a major role in the development and 

sustainability of biofilms, it has recently come to light that they may be important in 

the disruption of already established ones (3). A biofilm is a community of 

microorganisms that adhere to a solid or fluid interface. They are usually organized in 

microcolonies and surrounded by a self-produced matrix of water and polymeric 

substances (71). They present a severe problem in healthcare contexts, as they are 

related to pathogenic and chronic diseases, in the food industry, by attaching to 

equipment and work surfaces, as well as the environment, by triggering biocorrosion 

(72–74). The emulsifying properties of BSFs give them an advantage in the control of 

biofilms. However, this efficiency is dependent on a number of conditionings such as 

the composition of the medium, temperature, BSF concentration and time of exposure 

(5). An example of this biofilm-control effect has been demonstrated in the lipopeptide 

putisolvin, produced by Pseudomonas putida, that was able to arrest the growth of 

biofilms in other Pseudomonas strains (75). Another interesting example was shown 

when cirugic catheters were covered in surfactin solution and later inoculated with cell 

bacterial suspensions. The catheters with surfactin exhibited lower level of 

colonization by Salmonella, E.coli and Proteus mirabilis (48). 

BSFs possess antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, having been 

suggested as alternative antibiotics and antimicrobials (49). They have been reported 

to inhibit bacterial growth, stimulating the immune system of the host, and even 



14 
 

capable of cell lysis since their structure allows them to affect the permeability of the 

cell membrane with the same properties as a detergent (48). However, real BSF 

applications on pharmaceutics and health areas is still limited (76). Surfactin has 

proved to be one of the most resourceful and useful biosurfactants in this area. It has 

the ability to inhibit coagulation processes and even forming ionic channels within the 

membrane, as well as reducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells (49). Surfactin also 

displays effective antiviral activity, being able to inactivate herpes virus, retrovirus and 

some other RNA and DNA viruses (14). Iturin, another lipopetide produced by B. 

subtilis exhibits remarkable antifungal activity and is known to alter both morphology 

and structure of cell membranes in yeasts. Daptomicyn, a lipopeptide produced by 

Streptomyces roseosporus was incorporated in a commercial antibiotic, as a drug 

named cubicin. It is used in the treatment of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus 

aureus and other Gram positive bacteria (77,78). In the glycolipids family, it has been 

demonstrated that some rhamnolipids, produced by P. aeruginosa cultures, exhibit 

high antifungal activity against some fungi strains (79). 

BSFs can also have an important role in the food industry. Emulsification is a 

major determinant of the consistency and texture of foods (80,81). The stability of the 

emulsification complex can be improved by addition of a BSF to the system. 

Processed foods, like butter and mayonnaise, are some examples of emulsions. A 

recent study has proved the utility of a BSF produced by Candida utilis in the 

formulation of mayonnaise, used as a salad dressing (82), while some rhamnolipids 

are used to enhance the properties of frozen desserts and butter (83).  

 

1.7. Co-cultivation as a tool to enhance BSF production 

 

In order to increase the yield of BSF production, and, therefore minimize its 

production costs in an industrial scale, there has been a search for new ways to 

cultivate BSF-producing microorganisms (8). The search for BSF producing bacteria 

able to do so under extreme conditions or in uncommon habitats is a recent and still 

limited field, but it has shown great promise. Darvish et al (24) reported the discovery 



15 
 

of microbial consortium of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas in extreme 

conditions of temperature and pH. Some Pseudomonas strains are able to grow from 

orchids and forest herb floral nectar (84). A strain of Bacillus licheniformis was 

observed to growth in anaerobic conditions and producing a BSF capable of reducing 

surface tension to 28 m N/m (25). 

Another strategy to minimize the BSF production costs is the cultivation in low-

cost and raw materials, like industrial waste and vegetable oil (6). There has been a 

number of waste products that have been used in the cultivation of BSF producing 

bacteria, such as oily effluents, animal and vegetable fat, whey, corn, glycerol, 

ethanol, soapstock, etc (14). Recent studies in molecular biology of microorganisms 

have reported that often some microbial compounds are not produced under 

laboratory conditions, but rather remain unexpressed, resulting in only a fraction of 

the microbial compounds potential being obtained (85,86). 

A study by Mearns-Spragg (87) showed an increase in the production of 

antimicrobial compounds in marine bacteria when cultured with terrestrial bacterial 

strains, such as S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Co-cultivation, then, appears as 

an emerging strategy to induce the expression of secondary metabolites. This 

approach attempts to recreate the natural environment of the complex microbial 

communities, where they establish biotic relations. The competition for nutrients and 

antagonism are examples of situations that may trigger the production of secondary 

metabolites, such as BSF (85,86).  

A study by Kanagasabhapathy and Nagata (88) reported that four antibiotic 

producing bacteria isolated from the marine sponge Pseudoceratina purpurea 

increased their antimicrobial activity when exposed to two strains of human 

pathogenic bacteria. In 2011, Dusane et. al (85) showed that there was an increase in 

BSF production between bacteria and fungi, when co-cultured together. It also 

showed an increase of antimicrobial activity in Bacillus strains, especially when co-

cultivated with P. aeruginosa and B. pumilis, both biofilm forming strains. 

This cultivation strategy can be performed on either solid or liquid media, and 

has shown promising results, although much remains to be studied (89). 



16 
 

1.8.  Objectives 

 

The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that co-cultivation of BSF the 

producing strains, B. licheniformis and Pseudomonas sp., with biofilm forming strains, 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria innocua, could stimulate the production of 

surfactin and rhamnolipids, respectively. The tensioactive effect was tested by four 

methods: the oil spray test, the drop collapse assay and cultivation in blood agar. 

Quantification of BSFs was performed by cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue 

medium; the CPC-BTB method, and the specific quantification of rhamnolipids was 

conducted by the orcinol method. Quorum sensing inhibition effect of cultures and co-

cultures in Chromobacterium violaceum was also assessed.

2. Methods 

 

2.1. Bacterial cultures and culture media 

 

As BSF-producing strains, Bacillus licheniformis, a surfactin producer isolated 

in volcano sediments of the Cadis golf, provided by António Louvado (personal 

contact) and Pseudomonas #74, a rhamnolipid producer, isolated in Aveiro Ria by 

Patrícia Domingues, (90), were used. As inducing strains (pathogenic/biofilm forming) 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC® 27853 and Listeria innocua were used. L. innocua 

was obtained from Escola Superior de Biotecnologia (Universidade Católica 

Portuguesa, Portugal). Listeria innocua is a gram positive bacteria, that forms biofilms 

and although non pathogenic, it is genetically close to the food pathogen Listeria 

monocytogenes (91,92). P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative, biofilm forming bacteria, 

that is highly pathogenic. It can grow within a wide range of environmental 

condtitiond, although optimmaly at 37°C and in aerobic conditions (93). 

All cultures were stored at -80°C, with glycerol as a crio-protector. In order to 

obtain active cultures, the frozen culture was inoculated in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB,  

Liofilchem) and incubated at 37°C, with agitation (150 rpm) for 24h. The cultures were 

successively re-inoculated and incubated in the same conditions. Plate streakings 

were also performed in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Liofilchem) between every liquid re-

inoculation, in order to confirm the purity of the cultures. The plates were incubated at 

37°C for 24 h and stored at 4 ºC.  

For the experiments of cultivation and co-cultivation fresh cultures of B. 

licheniformis and Pseudomonas #74 were transferred from TSB to optimized media, 

by co-inoculating 1ml of the producing strain with 100 µl of either of the inducing 

strains (85). The B. licheniformis axenic culture and the co-cultures B. licheniformis + 

Listeria innocua and B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa were cultured in Luria Bertani 

medium (LB, Liofilchem). The Pseudomonas axenic culture and and the co-cultures 

(Pseudomonas + Listeria innocua and Pseudomonas + P. aeruginosa) were 



20 
 

cultivated in minimal salt medium, adapted from Rikalovic et. al (54), with 1.07 g/L 

NH4CL, 1.49 g/L KCL, 14.54 g/L TrisHCL, 0.2 g/L MgS04, 10 g/L triptone and 0.7 ml/L 

olive oil.  

The incubation time corresponding to early stationary phase was determined 

and used in the experiments of biosurfactant production. 

 

2.2. Growth time of cultures and co-cultures 

 

In order to monitor and determine the optimal time for the production of 

biosurfactants (late exponential phase, early stationary phase), growth curves of 

every axenic culture and co-cultures were constructed using the media described 

above. The cultures were incubated a 37°C, with agitation (120 rpm), for 10 h. During 

the incubation period, aliquots were collected hourly to determine the optical density 

(OD 600 nm) of the cultures, using non-inoculated media as blanks. 3 independent 

assays, with 1 replica each were conducted. 

 

2.3. Quantification and detection of biosurfactants 

 

The presence and activity of biosurfactants in early stationary phase cultures 

and co-cultures was evaluated by six different methods. Escherichia coli DH5? was 

used as a negative control. The chemical surfactants Tween 80 (12 mM), CTAB (0.2 

mM) and SDS (5%) were used as positive controls. 

 

2.3.1. Oil spray  

 

The oil spray method was conducted as described by Burch et. al (2010) (37). 

Using a needle, TSA plates were inoculated with axenic and co-cultures and 

incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Paraffin oil was sprayed (Merck) on the surface of the 

TSA plates using an airbrush (Thomas 50 Hz) and the formation of halos surrounding 

the producing colonies were the interpreted as an indication of BSF production.  



21 
 

Each assay had 3 replicas, in a total of 3 independent assays. 

 

2.3.2. Drop collapse assay 

 

For a quantitative analysis, an adapted method of drop collapse assay from 

Bodour and Miller-Maier, 1998 (94) was performed on axenic cultures and co-cultures 

cell free extracts (CFE). The CFEs were obtained by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 3 min) 

(Themo scientific, motor radius: 8 cm) and filtration with a serynge and filtration 

membrane (Frilabo, 0.22 µm) 

A drop of destilled water (5 µl) was placed on a plastic petri dish, previously 

cleaned with distilled water and ethanol (97%). Using a micropipette, 1 µl of sample or 

controls (SDS 5% and CTAB 0.2 mM as positive controls, water as negative control) 

were then placed at the center of the water drop. The drop was left to rest for 1 

minute and later examined using a magnifying glass (Olympus cover-015) and the 

diameter was measured. If the drop collapsed after BSF addition, in comparison with 

the negative control, the results was interpreted as positive (94).  

4 independent assays, with 5 replicas each, were conducted. 

 

2.3.3. Bood agar hemolysis 

 

Blood Agar plates (Merck) were inoculated with axenic cultures and co-cultures 

and incubated at 37°C for 48 h.The presence of grey halos, considered as ?-

hemolysis (or partial hemolysis), or transparent halos, interpreted as ?-hemolysis (or 

total hemolysis) around the colonies confirmed both the presence and activity of the 

BSF. The absence of halos was considered ??-hemolysis (lack of hemolysis) (95). 

3 independent assays were conducted, with 1 replica of each test. 

 

 

 

 



22 
 

2.3.4. CTAB-methylene blue agar 

 

Plates containing the CTAB-methylene blue medium (0.2 g/L CTAB Sigma 

Aldrich, 0.005 g/L methylene blue; 15 g/L agar Liofilchem, 1.38 g/L Triptone Oxoid, 

4g/L MgSO4.7H20 Applichem, 1 g/L Na2HPO4.2H2O Applichem; 0.005 g/L 

CaCl2.2H2O, 25 ml/L glycerol Sigma Aldrich (96) were inoculated with axenic and co-

cultures. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h (44) and subsequently stored in 

the refrigerator at 4°C for 7 days (97). The presence of dark blue halos was 

considered a positive result for the presence and activity of anionic BSF.  

 

2.3.5. CPC-BTB  

 

For this colorimetric assay, an adapted method from Yang et. al, 2015 (45) 

was used. Cetilpiridinium chloride (CPC) (Sigma Aldrich) and bromotimol blue (BTB) 

(Alfa Aesar) were dissolved separately in 0.1M PBS (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0) to 

obtain 0.2 mM solutions. Subsequently, 20 mL of each solution were mixed together 

in order to obtain a green reagent. 800 µl of the reagent was added to 100µl of the 

CFE of axenic cultures and co-cultures (previously incubated in optimized medium for 

24h) and left to rest for 5 minutes, at room temperature. The chromatic shift from 

green to blue, created by addition of the reagent to the cultures, confirmed the 

presence and activity of BSFs. The absorbance was read at 590 nm. For each 

individual test, a standard curve was prepared, using SDS solutions with the 

concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 300 mg/L (45). 

3 independent assays, with 3 replicas each, were conducted. 

 

2.3.6. Orcinol method 

 

For specific detection and quantification of rhamnolipids, the colorimetric 

orcinol method adapted from Tahzibi et al., 2003 (98) was used. The orcinol reagent 

was prepared by mixing 0.19 g of orcinol (3-5 dihydroxitoluene, Sigma Aldrich) with 



23 
 

54.6 mL of sulfuric acid (97%) (Merck) and adding distilled water until final volume of 

100 ml. For each independent assay, a calibration curve using different rhamnose 

concentrations (0mg/L (blank); 1.563 mg/L; 3,125 mg/L; 6.25 mg/L; 12.5 mg/L; 

25mg/L; 50 mg/L) was constructed. The CFEs were obtained by centrifugation (6000 

rpm, 3min) (Thermo Scientifc; motor radius: 8 cm) and filtration membrane (Frilabo, 

0.22µm) 

For the determination of BSF in the CFE, 100µl of CFE was added to 900 µl of 

orcinol reagent, in 2 ml microtubes. The samples were heated up to 100°C for 20 

min., in a heating plate, and later cooled down to room temperature. The optical 

density at 421 nm was measured (96).  

 

2.3.7. Quorum sensing Inhibition 

 

The method for evaluating quorum sensing inhibition was adapted from 

McLean et al., 2004 (99). Axenic cultures and co-cultures were inoculated in LB agar 

plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The indicator strain, Chromobacterium 

violaceum , was grown in LB broth, overnight at 30°C. Aliquots of 5µl of C. violaceum 

culture were mixed with 5 mL of LB soft agar (5%), previously heated and cooled to 

45°C. The test plates were covered with the overlay of inoculated LB soft agar and 

incubated overnight at 30°C. Garlic slices were used as positive controls (100) and a 

colony of C. violaceum was used as negative control. The depigmented zones 

surrounding the colonies were interpreted as quorum sensing inhibition

independent assays. The bars represent the deviations. 

 

The growth time of the axenic cultures and co-cultures of Pseudomonas #74 

stationary phase was reached after approximately 6 h, and slightly earlier (4 h) in the 

cultures with B. licheniformis. Axenic cultures and co-cultures of each of the BSF 

producing strains reached similar maximum optical density at stationary phase (0.2 

nm for Pseudomonas #74 cultures and 0.21 nm B. licheniformis). This is in 

accordance with existing literature that does not present significant differences 

between axenic and co-cultures growth curves (101) 

Since BSF are considered secondary metabolites, produced in the stationary 

phase, for the following tasks a period of incubation of 48 h was established. after 

stationary phase proceeds, BSF are released to the medium but they can be later 

incorporated and used as carbon sources, as other substrates in the medium become 

exhausted (8)

pulverized with a fine layer of paraffin oil. The appearance of halos is due to the 

tensioactive reaction of the BSF with the paraffin oil (35). The diameter of the 

produced halo is directly correlated with the concentration and activity of BSFs 

(35,37).

Table 2 summarizes the results of the oil spray assay conducted on colonies 

originating from axenic cultures or co-cultures, as well as controls. This results were 

further classified qualitatively as weakly positive (+; diameter&amp;lt;1 cm), positive (++; 

diameter ? 1 cm) or negative (-; no halo). As expected, halos were formed around all 

the axenic cultures and co-cultures and the positive control (CTAB 0.2mM) which is in 

accordance with literature (37,102). 

The halos of the Pseudomonas cultures P – Pseudomonas #74, P+P – 

Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa, and P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua were 

significantly larger than the B – B. licheniformis; B+P – B. licheniformis + P. 

aeruginosa; B+L – B. licheniformis + L. innocua cultures, with Pseudomonas cultures 

displaying an average diameter of 2.33 cm and Bacillus cultures an average of 0.62 

cm.The surfactin CMC is estimated to be 9.4 × 10?6 M (~9.7 mg/L) (103) and the 

rhamnolipid CMC is estimated to be 18 x 10-6 M.This could mean that, even though 

rhamnolipid displays less tensioactive ability than surfactin, it is liberated to the 

medium in higher quantities and produces bigger halos diameters. However, the 

diameter of the halos produced by co-cultures was not significantly different from 

those produced by the axenic cultures of the producer species (ANOVA, p&gt;0.05). 

Considering that this method in an expedite tool for the screening of BSF producing 

strains but it suffers from low accuracy, in comparison to other quantitative methods 

(104) the results may interpreted as an indication that co-cultivation did not induce a 

change in BSF production in either of the producing bacterial species or that shifts in 

productivity were too subtle to be detected by the diameter of the halos. This assay 

does, however, display some major advantages in relation to some more accurate 

methods, such as the drop collapse assay because it detects low concentrations of 

BSF, making it possible to identify some BSF producing strains that would not be 

overlooked if tested by other methods (35,37).

3.3. Drop collapse assay 

 

When a drop of water is applied to a hydrophobic surface, it will form a bead, due 

to the polar water molecules that are repelled from the surface. However, if the 

droplet contains a surfactant, the interfacial tension between drop and surface is 

reduced, which results in the collapse and spreading of the water drop (94). This is 

the principle of the drop collapse assay that is performed on an oil/water droplet, 

where a small amount of cell suspension or surfactant sample is placed at the center. 

If the cell suspension contains BSF, the water/oil droplet will collapse and spread 

(94,105).

innocua ; B – B. licheniformis; B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L – B. licheniformis + 
L. innocua). Distilled water was used as a negative control. CTAB (0.2 mM) and SDS (5%) were 
used as positive controls. The values are presented mm. The bars represent the standard 
deviation. 

As expected, drops with CFE of axenic and co-cultures presented a 

significantly larger diameter than drops with negative control, water, as is 

extensively reported in literature (94,106–109) Positive controls, SDS (5%) and 

CTAB (0.2 mM) presented the largest diameters. 

Experimental conditions P – Pseudomonas #74, P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + 

P. aeruginosa and P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua presented medium 

diameter values of 9.4 mm, 8.9 mm and 9.4 mm, respectively. B – B. licheniformis, 

B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa and B+L – B. licheniformis + L. innocua 

displayed medium diameters of 9.5 mm, 9.4 mm and 9.5 mm, respectively. SDS 

(5%) and CTAB (0.2 mM) increased the diameter of the water drops to medium 

values of 11.3 mm and 12.0 mm, respectively. Differences between the results 

corresponding to axenic cultures and co-cultures were not significant (ANOVA 

p&gt;0.05), which means there is no influence in the tensioactive effect of the BSF 

when its producing strains are co-cultured with the biofilm forming strains. In 2011, 

Dusane et al, described a positive result, in which the zone diameter of the drop 

collapse assay performed on CFE of B. pumilus co-cultured with P.aeruginosa 

and B. licheniformis co-cultured with B. pumilus increased significantly (85). This 

indicates that the outcome of the production efficiency is highly dependent on the 

producing strain but also on the inducer strain elected for co-cultivation. 

The cultures and co-cultures also exhibit a lower tensioactive effect that the 

commercialized surfactants, which might be related to the low sensitivity of this 

method, as a significant concentration of the BSF has to be present in order to 

cause a bigger collapse of the drop (110).

3.4. Blood agar hemolysis 

 

Agar plates supplemented with 5% blood were used to detect BSF production 

through the appearance of transparent or yellow/green halos around colonies, 

corresponding to hemolysis of red blood cells by the BSF produced (96).  

SDS (5%) was used as positive control and presents ?-hemolysis (total hemolysis) 

and E.coli SH5? was used as negative control, as shown in fig. 6. The plates 

inoculated with P – Pseudomonas #74, P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa 

and P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua cultures showed yellow/green halos (fig. 

6) indicating the occurrence of partial hemolysis (?-hemolysis) and oxidation of 

hemoglobin. B. licheniformis axenic cultures and co-cultures, B – B. licheniformis, 

B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa and B+L – B. licheniformis + L. innocua, did 

not display hemolytic activity, as seen in fig 8.  

 

         

Figure 8. Example of plates corresponding to the blood agar hemolysis method performed on 
axenic cultures and co-cultures of B. licheniformis or Pseudomonas #74, and controls. A

control. A- Positive control, SDS, and negative control, E. coli DH5?. B- Axenic and co-cultures

The diameters of the hemolysis halos are presented in table 4. Differences 

between cultures are not significant (ANOVA, p&gt;0.5). It is important to refer that, this 

method is performed on a very specific medium that is not the optimal medium 

determined for the axenic and co-cultures, and it’s difficult to determine if the 

productivity would be different in other mediums (44)

Pseudomonas strains typically exhibit hemolytic activity (?-hemolysis), that 

may be caused by toxins, enzimes or rhamnolipids, although the hemolytic ability is 

mostly related to rhamnolipid production (111). However, due to the multiple factors 

that may originate hemolysis, this assay is considered neither reliable nor accurate as 

the sole approach to BSF as it may deliver false positive or false negative results 

(112) and it should always be interpreted in the light of other sources of evidence. 

Although the B. licheniformis cultures did not exhibit hemolysis, that does not mean 



35 
 

surfactin was not produced. To detect the surfactin produced by Bacillus strains, 

methods based in cell suspensions are more usually applied (113,114), as 

concentrations tend to build up in suspensions where hemolytic activity is more likely 

to be detected (112).  

 

3.5. CTAB-methylene blue agar 

 

This is a specific test based on the appearance of dark blue halos due to the 

binding of anionic surfactants to CTAB (cationic surfactant), in the presence of 

methylene blue (42,43,96). This method is mainly used for the detection and 

quantification of rhamnolipids, but it was also used here for detection of surfactin 

production, as it is also an anionic surfactant. The diameter of the halo is dependent 

on the concentration of the BSF which makes it possible to interpret the results on a 

semi-quantitative way (44). The production of BSF was classified as weakly positive 

(+, diameter &amp;lt;5 mm), positive (++,  diameter ? 5 mm) or negative (-, no halo).  

After a 48h incubation period, only the cultures containing the inducer strain P. 

aeruginosa (P+P, B+P) displayed positive results (Table 3). However, when the 

plates were refrigerated for 72 hours more, all the axenic cultures and co-cultures (P- 

Pseudomonas #74; P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas 

#74 + L. innocua ; B – B. licheniformis; B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L – 

B. licheniformis + L. innocua), except for the B. licheniformis axenic culture, 

developed dark blue halos considered to be positive results. The low temperatures 

enhance the precipitation of the dye and intensify the color of the halos that were 

undistinguishable immediately after the incubation (43).

blue halo around the colonies was interpreted as a positive result. Diameters are expressed

There was a significant increase (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) in BSF production in co-

cultures with P. aeruginosa (P+P; B+P), in relation to the corresponding axenic 

cultures, as illustrated in 5. When the axenic cultures were co-cultured with the 

inducing strain, P. aeruginosa, their halo diameter increased from 4,7mm to 11,7mm 



37 
 

(P&lt;P+P) and from 0mm to 12,7mm. This method is more rigorous and reliable than 

the oil spray and blood agar test, as it considers only the anionic properties of the 

BSF, and other metabolites do not interfere(98). 

One possible explanation to the fact that the co-cultures with P. aeruginosa 

displayed a significant increase over axenic and co-culture with L. innocua may be 

due to the fact that P. aeruginosa was acting not only as inducing, biofilm forming 

strain but also as a rhamnolipids producing strain. P. aeruginosa is one of the most 

prominent rhamnolipids producer, and it is well described in literature that 

rhamnolipids from P. aeruginosa produce positive results in this method.(56,96,115) It 

is also to be noted that this method, contrary to the oil spray and the blood agar 

method, used the minimal salt medium (supplemented with CTAB and methylene 

blue) considered optimal for the Pseudomonas culture, which could have helped 

increase BSF production. To further investigate the P. aeruginosa role in these 

results, cultivation in CTAB-methylene blue agar of an axenic culture of P. aeruginosa 

should be performed. 

The cultures P – Pseudomonas #74, P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua and 

B+L – B. licheniformis + L. innocua showed positive results for the production of 

anionic BSF production, which is in accordance with the literature (43,115). B 

licheniformis was the only culture in which BSF production could not be detected by 

this method. A similar result was obtained by Lin et. al, 1998, in which this screening 

method did not work for a B. subtilis strain, because its growth was inhibited by 

CTAB. CTAB has been shown to inhibit some bacteria activity, by binding to cell 

substrate and inhibiting bacteria to adhere to substrates(44,116,117). 

According to the results of the CTAB-methylene blue assay, co-cultivation with 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a clear increase in the concentration of BSF 

molecules in the cultures.. The best combination for the co-cultivation of 

Pseudomonas #74 was P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa and the best co-

culture for Bacillus licheniformis was B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa.

control. A- Axenic and co-cultures of Pseudomonas #74. B – Axenic and co-cultures of B.

3.6. CPC-BTB method 

 

This method allows a qualitative detection and quantitative analysis of anionic 

surfactants and it is based on the formation of a complex between BTB-bromotimol 

blue, (negative charge), a color indicator, and CPC-cetylpiridinium chloride (positive 

charge), a mediator. BTB displays a blue color (pH 8), but when CPC is added, a 

green complex is formed. Adding BSF will bind to CPC, freeing the BTB that goes 

back to displaying the blue color (45).  

This chromatic shift is a qualitative result of the BSF production and by reading 

the optical density a quantitative result of BSF activity can be determined (45). For 

each assay, a calibration curve was constructed with different SDS concentrations. 

The BSF concentration was estimated as SDS equivalents and the results are 

presented in table 5.  

All the cultures showed BSF production, with the exception of axenic culture of 

Pseudomonas #74. The values obtained range from 6 mg/L in the axenic culture of B. 

licheniformis, to 41 mg/L in the co-culture of Pseudomonas #74 with L. innocua. 

There was an enhancement of BSF production in co-cultures, in relation to axenic 

cultures (B – B. licheniformis&amp;lt;B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa&amp;lt;B+L – B. 



39

aeruginosa&amp;lt;P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua).

licheniformis + P. aeruginosa B+L – B. licheniformis + L. innocua and P – Pseudomonas #74 

&lt;P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua) estimated in 
mg/L SDS equivalents by the CPC-BTB assay. 

 

Since it is a new method, the literature data for the concentration of 

biosurfactants in Pseudomonas cultures is still not available. The values are within 

the range reported in literature for different Bacillus strains (45,118). However, these 

values should be interpreted in a comparative context, as they are expressed in SDS 

equivalents, and not in surfactin or rhamnolipid concentrations. SDS displays a 

chromatic shift to blue around 300 mg/L and surfactin only at 600 mg/L (45). This 

might mean that SDS has a higher binding power to CPC, and the values estimated 

here may represent an underestimation. Rhamnolipid and surfactin standards must 

be used in future to obtain exact concentration estimates in the samples.

3.7. Orcinol method 

 

The orcinol method is the most widely used for the quantification of 

rhamnolipids. The rhamnose groups in the rhamnolipids react with the orcinol 

reagent and produce different colours, depending on rhamnolipid concentration 

(Chandrasekaran and BeMiller 1980; Koch et al. 1991). For each assay a 

standard curve is prepared with rhamnose, for quantification, but a correction 

factor has to be taken into account, in order to compensate the extra mass in the 

lipid portion of the rhamnolipids  (119). Déziel et al (46) proposed a correction 

factor of 2.25. One problem with this approach is that the results will vary with the 

proportion of mono- to di-RLs in the culture to be analyzed. 

 

 

Figure 11. Rhamnolipid concentration by the orcinol assay. Results are expressed in rhamnose 
equivalents (mg/L). The bars represent the deviations. 

 

As expected, there was production of rhamnolipids by the Pseudomonas 

cultures, detected by the orcinol method, as it is extensively reported in literature 

(20,115,120,121).

Rhamnolipid concentration (orcinol method)



41 
 

 The average rhamnolipid concentration was 33.9 mg/L for axenic cultures of 

Pseudomonas, 25.3 mg/L for P+L – Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua and 44.9 mg/L 

for P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa. Differences between the rhamnolipid 

concentrations in axenic cultures and co-cultures were not significant (ANOVA &gt; 

0.05).  

 

3.8. Quorum-sensing inhibition 

 

The main role of quorum-sensing is thought to be the control of bacterial 

population density. In habitats where bacterial populations compete for resources or 

in cases where bacteria infect a determined host, the ability to interfere with this 

bacterial cell-cell communication is both an advantage and a defense mechanism. 

This process is known as quorum-quenching (30,33) 

In this qualitative assay, the effect of axenic cultures and co-cultures (P- 

Pseudomonas #74; P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa; P+L Pseudomonas 

#74 + L. innocua ; B – B. licheniformis; B+P – B. licheniformis + P. aeruginosa; B+L – 

B. licheniformis + L. innocua) was tested on the inhibition of the quorum sensing 

mechanism of Chromobacterium violaceum. A positive result of quorum-quenching 

was interpreted as a depigmentation around the C. violaceum culture and 

corresponds to the inhibition of the production of the purple pigmentation, the results 

are summarized in Table 5. 

Positive results corresponding to a quorum quenching effect were obtained for 

P – Pseudomonas #74, P+P – Pseudomonas #74 + P. aeruginosa, P+L – 

Pseudomonas #74 + L. innocua, as seen in figure 13. However, it is not possible, 

through this method to conclude if these positive results were due to the co-cultivation 

or even due to the BSFs present in the cultures, as these results may be caused by 

other molecular mechanisms. Existing literature has shown that C. violaceum 

regulates his pigmentation production by the N-hexanoyl HSL (C6-HSL), a AHL auto-

inducer (30,32), while some studies have shown that Pseudomonas strains use two 

signal molecules, 3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactione (3-oxo-C12 HSL) and N-



42 
 

butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) as their inducers. These molecules will 

competitively bind and, subsequently, inhibit the receptor for the cognate signal C6-

HSL C. violaceum, readily inhibiting its QS process (32). It is possible that this 

inhibition effect could be caused by Pseudomonas metabolites other than AHLs. A 

mutated strain of P. aeruginosa incapable of producing both 3-oxo-dodecanoyl 

homoserine lactione (3-oxo-C12 HSL) and N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), 

retained significant QS inhibition activity, suggesting this activity to be regulated by 

other QS products (99) namely BSFs. In general, although a quorum sensing 

inhibition effect was demonstrated in Pseudomonas #74 cultures and co-cultures, the 

effect cannot be unequivocally related to the BSF, as other secondary metabolites 

may be involved.

The results weren’t always coherent between each other. This might be due to 

the fact that each method analyses different properties of the BSFs. Oil spray, for 

example, is only used for BSF detection. CTAB-methylene blue relies on the anionic 

properties of the BSF. Blood agar hemolysis analyses the haemolytic properties of 

the BSF. The orcinol method is used for rhamnolipid concentration assessment and 

the drop collapse assay is an indicator of the BSF tensioactive activity that depends 

on the size and ramification level of the lipid(122,123). 

A more detailed chemical characterization of the BSF present in the extracts 

would be necessary for a better understanding of the results and of the mechanisms 

of biological interaction between the producer and inducer strains 



45 
 

Even so, it is clear, through the CTAB-methylene blue agar and CPC-BTB 

assays the most intense reactions were displayed by the co-cultures of the producing 

bacteria.

Conclusion 



48 
 

  

  



49 
 

In conclusion, the CPC-BTB method and the CTAB-methylene blue test showed a 

clear increase in the concentration of BSF molecules produced which sustains the 

hypothesis that co-cultivation of BSF-producer strains with inducers strains may 

cause a shift the production of BSFs. However, the oil spray, blood hemolysis, drop 

collapse and orcinol methods did not show significant differences between axenic 

cultures and co-cultures. Different methods describe different properties of the BSF 

(e.g. tenso-active effect, concentration) and they must be interpreted as a whole. 

However, considering that BSF are most often released as mixtures of molecules, it is 

imperative to obtain information on the chemical characterization of the BSF pool 

produced in each experimental condition so that the effect of the interaction between 

producers and inducers can be understood at the molecular level and key for further 

biotechnological applications are provided.
