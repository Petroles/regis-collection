resumo 

 
A presente tese resulta de um trabalho de investigação, cujo propósito se centrou no 
aumento de conhecimento do comportamento de vigas metálicas compostas de alma 
cheia sujeitas a encurvadura por esforço transverso em situação de incêndio. 
 
O principal objetivo desta tese consiste em suprir a ausência de regras para o 
dimensionamento de elementos estruturais metálicos sujeitos a encurvadura por 
esforço transverso a temperaturas elevadas. 
 
Com essa finalidade, foi desenvolvido um modelo numérico no programa de elementos 
finitos SAFIR para a simulação do comportamento deste tipo de vigas quando sujeitas 
a temperaturas elevadas. Estas análises numéricas enquadram-se na metodologia 
habitualmente designada por GMNIA – geometrically and materially non-linear 
imperfect analysis. Após a validação do modelo numérico com ensaios experimentais 
da literatura, foi também avaliada a influência das imperfeições geométricas e das 
tensões residuais na capacidade resistente das vigas, tanto à temperatura normal 
como a temperaturas elevadas. 
 
O Eurocódigo 3 estabelece que a resistência à encurvadura por esforço transverso de 
vigas em I resulta da soma de duas componentes, a resistência da alma e a 
contribuição dos banzos. Começou-se por avaliar a contribuição dos banzos e 
verificou-se que os resultados obtidos com as expressões do Eurocódigo 3 poderiam 
ser melhorados. Assim, foi proposta a aplicação de um fator corretivo de forma a 
melhorar as previsões do Eurocódigo 3 para a contribuição dos banzos para a 
resistência à encurvadura por esforço transverso. 
 
A principal parcela da resistência à encurvadura por esforço transverso é dada pela 
alma. As expressões do Eurocódigo 3 para a determinação da resistência da alma à 
encurvadura por esforço transverso foram avaliadas. Esta análise demonstrou que a 
alguns dos resultados não estão do lado da segurança e que a precisão das 
expressões de dimensionamento do Eurocódigo 3 poderia ser melhorada. Portanto, 
foram propostas alterações a estas expressões usadas para o dimensionamento à 
temperatura normal. Para além disso, foram propostas novas expressões para o 
dimensionamento deste tipo de elementos em caso de exposição ao fogo. 
 
A expressão do Eurocódigo 3 usada para a verificação da segurança de elementos 
estruturais metálicos sujeitos à interação entre esforço transverso e momento fletor foi 
também avaliada, verificando-se que a aplicação das propostas para modificação das 
expressões usadas para a determinação da resistência à encurvadura por esforço 
transverso origina melhorias nos resultados desta expressão, principalmente a 
temperaturas elevadas. 
 
Por fim, apresenta-se uma análise da influência de diferentes parâmetros na 
capacidade resistente de vigas compostas de alma cheia sujeitas a encurvadura por 
esforço transverso, tais como a espessura da alma, a altura da alma, a espessura dos 
banzos e a tensão de cedência do aço.

abstract 

 
This thesis is a research work aiming the increasing of knowledge of the behaviour of 
steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling in fire situation. 
 
The main objective of this thesis is to overcome the lack of rules for the design of steel 
structural elements subjected to shear buckling at high temperatures. 
 
For this purpose, a numerical model was developed in the finite element software 
SAFIR to simulate the behaviour of steel plate girders under shear loading at elevated 
temperatures. These numerical analyses fall into the methodology commonly referred 
as GMNIA – geometrically non-linear materially imperfect analysis. After validation of 
the numerical model with experimental tests from the literature, the influence of the 
geometric imperfections and residual stresses on the bearing capacity of the girders, at 
both normal and elevated temperatures, was evaluated. 
 
Eurocode 3 states that the shear buckling resistance of steel I girders is given by the 
sum of two components, the web resistance and the contribution from the flanges. 
Firstly it was assessed the contribution from flanges and it was found that the results 
obtained with the Eurocode 3 expressions could be improved. Thus, it was proposed 
the application of a corrective factor in order to improve the predictions of Eurocode 3 
for the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. 
 
The main part of the shear buckling resistance comes from the web. The expressions of 
Eurocode 3 for determining the web resistance to shear buckling were evaluated. This 
analysis demonstrated that some of the results are not on the safe side and the 
accuracy of these expressions could be improved. So, changes to the expressions 
applied for the design at normal temperature were proposed. Furthermore, new 
expressions for fire design of such structural elements were also proposed. 
 
The expression of Eurocode 3 used for the safety calculation of steel structural 
elements under interaction between shear and bending was also evaluated. It was 
verified that the application of the proposals for modification of the expressions used to 
determine the shear buckling resistance introduces improvements on the results 
provided by this expression, mainly at elevated temperatures. 
 
Finally, an analysis of the influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear 
strength of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling, such as the web thickness, 
the web depth, the flange thickness and the steel yield strength, is presented.

Chapter 1 Introduction 

1.1 Background of the problem 

Steel plate girders are widely used as structural members in the construction industry 

due to their capacity to support heavy loads over long spans. A plate girder is basically 

an I-beam assembled from steel plates which are welded to each other. The common 

uses include bridges, medium and long span floors in buildings and crane girders in 

industrial structures (see Figure 1.1).  

Nowadays, finding the best cost-effective solution is a must in engineering. In steel 

construction, to overcome this challenge requires a compromise between weight-cost 

and strength which results in the use of slender cross-sections, as those typical from 

steel plate girders. Generally, they are used to carry loads which cannot be economically 

supported by hot-rolled beams. Standard hot-rolled cross-sections may be adequate for 

many of the usual structures, but in situations where the load is heavier and the span is 

also large, its application is usually uneconomical. 

The slender cross-sections of steel plate girders are usually composed by an assembly of 

plates which are commonly stated as web (internal element) and flanges (outstand 

elements). The web becomes deep and thin to reduce weight, making it susceptible to 

buckling when submitted to compressive stresses, thus affecting the ultimate bearing 

capacity of the plate girder. Therefore, it is common to design plate girders with 

transverse stiffeners and in some cases with longitudinal stiffeners (see Figure 1.2), in 

order to increase the buckling strength of the web plates. A good web design comprises 

finding the best combination of plate thickness and distance between transverse 

stiffeners that leads to an economic solution regarding material and fabrication costs. 

Moving on to some more technical details, it is important knowing that steel plate 

girders are normally subjected to various loading conditions, as for example bending, 

shear or patch loading. Each one of its components are designed to support a specific 

load, the flanges must resist compressive/tensile forces resulting from the bending stress 

distribution, while the slender webs should be able to withstand heavy shear loads as 

well as concentrated compressive loads due to patch loads. The web together with 

stiffeners must be capable to handle the tension field actions that result from shear 

buckling.

Fire is one of the most serious environmental hazards to which a steel structure can be 

subjected during its lifetime. This accidental action may cause a severe impact on steel 

structures, resulting in significant economic and public losses. Historical events suggest 

that fires are a significant hazard to steel bridges, with some of them causing the bridges 

to collapse (see Figure 1.3). A research conducted by the New York Department of 

Transportation (NYDOT) found that 53 of the total recorded bridge failures up to 2011 

are caused by fires and only 18 are caused by earthquakes (Garlock et al., 2011).  

People safe evacuation during a fire requires structural integrity. Steel plate girders are 

often placed in key points of buildings due to their capacity to support heavy loads over 

long spans, which highlights their importance and relevance for life safety. The 

exposure to elevated temperatures decreases substantially the stiffness and strength of 

steel structural elements and may even change their behaviour when compared to design 

at normal temperature (Kodur et al., 2013). 

Kodur and Naser (2014) found that shear capacity can decrease faster than bending 

capacity meaning the shear limiting state may be a dominant failure mode in steel plate 

girders subjected to fire. However, the results of this thesis showed an opposite trend. 

Furthermore, strong differences in the slenderness of the cross-sections, as it is the case 

for plate girders with thin webs and massive flanges, may increase the effect of the 

elevated temperatures developed during a fire (Scandella et al., 2014).

Over the past decades, the European Commission developed a set of harmonized 

procedures for the design of construction works, aiming the elimination of technical 

obstacles to trade in the Member States of the European Community. These design 

procedures were established and published by the European Committee for 

Standardization (CEN) that led to the development of the Structural Eurocodes. The 

Eurocodes are divided in ten parts (numbered from 0 to 9) addressing different topics: 

basis of structural design; actions necessary for the design of structures; specific rules 

and recommendations for structures made of different materials (concrete, steel, 

composite, timber, masonry and aluminium); earthquake resistance; geotechnical 

design. 

The Structural Eurocodes were developed with the objective of providing safe, 

economical and, as much as possible, simple procedures for the design of structures. 

Regarding fire design, simplified procedures given by those codes of practice are 

extremely important for civil engineers who do not always have access to applications 

dealing with advanced calculation methods. 

Eurocode 3 (EC3) is the one devoted to the design of steel structures (Simões da Silva 

et al., 2010). It is composed by twelve parts (numbered from 1 to 12). The first provides 

general rules for the design of steel structures (CEN, 2010a) and the remaining concern 

to particular characteristics of steel structures. There are two parts of EC3 with high 

relevance for this work. Part 1-5 of EC3 “Plated structural elements”, also named as EN 

1993-1-5 (CEN, 2006b), gives procedures for the design of plated structural elements at 

room temperature. Design rules for steel plate girders affected by shear buckling at 

normal temperature may be found in this part of EC3.  

Concerning fire resistance, Part 1-2 of EC3 “General rules – Structural fire design”, also 

named as EN 1993-1-2 (CEN, 2010b), gives prescriptions for the design of steel 

structural elements subjected to elevated temperatures. However, Part 1-2 of EC3 does 

not establish a procedure for checking the shear buckling resistance at elevated 

temperatures. One way to perform fire design is to use the shear design rules at normal 

temperature provided by Part 1-5 of EC3, adapted to fire design by the direct 

application of the reduction factors for stress-strain relationship of carbon steel at 

elevated temperatures from Part 1-2 of EC3.

1.2 Motivation and objectives 

Local buckling phenomena are very important for the design of steel structural elements 

with thin-walled cross-sections, as it is the case of steel plate girders. Therefore, these 

have been a common topic of several investigations over the past decades and the 

design of steel plate girders is well understood at normal temperature.  

Fire is a more common hazard than one would first think. However, local buckling in 

structural elements subjected to fire has not been receiving the same attention and only 

limited research has been conducted to predict the ultimate shear strength at elevated 

temperatures. 

Unfortunately, this hazard to steel structures is aggravated by the lack of fire design 

guidelines in the European Standards. This problem, together with the fact that elevated 

temperatures can cause a substantial reduction in the ultimate shear strength of steel 

plate girders, reinforces the interest of this thesis, which allowed evaluating if the 

procedures adopted in Part 1-5 of EC3 for the verification of shear buckling resistance 

at normal temperature are suitable for the same verification in case of fire, using the 

reduction factors for the steel stress-strain relationship at elevated temperatures. 

Due to the limited size of furnaces and the high cost of the fire resistance experimental 

tests, several studies about fire resistance of steel structures have been performed in 

recent years based on numerical simulations. However, it is necessary to duly validate 

numerical models before performing parametric studies and calibrated numerical 

models are still lacking. 

The main objective of this thesis is to develop more comprehensive, safe and economic 

guidance on the design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling, especially 

when subjected to fire. The overall objective was achieved through the following 

particular objectives: 

? to develop numerical models duly calibrated with experimental tests found in the 

literature; 

? to perform a solid parametric numerical study in order to generate results on 

commonly used plate girders in buildings; 

? to evaluate the accuracy of the expressions implemented in the European 

Standards for the design of steel plate girders at normal temperature; 



Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

? to evaluate the application of the design expressions for normal temperature to 

fire design; 

? to propose, if necessary, new expressions for design of steel plate girders 

subjected to shear buckling at elevated temperatures; 

? to ensure that the proposed expressions are in a format that is readily 

disseminated and used in the European Union by incorporating them into 

European Standards; 

This thesis is directly relevant for the construction industry where the use of steel plate 

girders is usual. The research presented here will allow filling the lack of guidance in 

the European Standards for the fire design of this type of structural elements. The 

proposed design rules are crucial to produce safe and cost-effective structures, being 

relevant to the life safety and society. Moreover, this thesis does not only result in shear 

design rules but also deliver a calibrated numerical model which may be relevant for 

future works of the research community. 

1.3 Document outline 

The achievement of the objectives described above is directly related to the realization 

of several studies performed during the development of this research. This section 

summarizes the main tasks carried out throughout this research work and how they are 

organized in the contents of the thesis.  

This thesis is organized in 10 Chapters. In Chapter 1 is done a brief introduction about 

the problem under investigation. The motivation and the main objectives are also 

presented here, as well as the structure of the document. 

The state of the art is presented in Chapter 2. The literature presented in this chapter is 

the result of a deep bibliographic search for scientific papers and publications dealing 

with the occurrence of shear buckling in steel plate girders. After a brief description of 

the behaviour of plate girders under shear loading, a summary of the theoretical models 

historically developed to predict the shear resistance of steel plate girders is presented. 

Finally, a compilation of the most relevant research developed over the last years is 

presented. 



Chapter 1. Introduction

In Chapter 3 the prescribed design rules for both normal temperature and fire design, 

according to Part 1-5 and Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b, 2010b), are presented. First, 

the EC3 design procedure is presented, to predict the shear resistance of steel plate 

girders affected by shear buckling at normal temperature. Then, the procedure to 

evaluate the interaction between shear and bending is described. Furthermore, the 

design rules for stiffeners are also presented in this chapter. Finally, the methodology 

used to evaluate the shear resistance of steel plate girders exposed to fire is presented, 

since no guidance is given in Part 1-2 of EC3 for the shear buckling evaluation in fire 

situation. 

Chapter 4 mainly deals with the numerical modelling with SAFIR (Franssen, 2005, 

2011) based on the finite element method. This chapter comprises the presentation of 

the numerical model, including boundary conditions and loading, as well as the material 

model at both normal and elevated temperatures. The initial imperfections incorporated 

into the numerical model are also described in this chapter. Furthermore, the validation 

of the numerical model with experimental tests collected from the literature is 

presented. The chapter concludes with the presentation of sensitivity analyses about the 

influence of the geometric imperfections and residual stresses on the numerical 

modelling of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling. 

In Chapter 5 are described the bases for the parametric study presented in the following 

chapters. The geometric and material properties of the plate girders analysed at both 

normal and elevated temperatures are presented, as well as the methodology of analysis 

of results based on the shear-bending interaction diagram.  

Chapters 6 to 8 are dedicated to the analysis and discussion of the numerical results, 

resulting from the parametric study considering the girders presented in Chapter 5. The 

analysis of the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance is 

presented in Chapter 6. The EC3 expression to predict the additional resistance given by 

the flanges is evaluated and the application of a corrective coefficient to the expression 

used for calculating the distance where the plastic hinges form in the flanges is 

proposed.  

In Chapter 7 a similar analysis is presented for the resistance from the web to shear 

buckling. The failure mechanism is described and new reduction factors for the web

contribution to shear buckling resistance are proposed for both normal and elevated 

temperatures. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis of the results is performed. 

In Chapter 8 the evaluation of the interaction between shear and bending is presented. 

The failure modes of the girders are also presented in this chapter, in function of the 

dominant effort which causes the collapse. Furthermore, a statistical analysis from the 

results of the girders which fail due to the interaction between shear and bending is 

presented. 

Chapter 9 is dedicated to the study of the influence of different parameters on the 

ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders. The increase of strength given by the 

increase of the cross-section properties is presented here, as well as the reduction of 

strength caused by the elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the 

configuration of the end posts on the ultimate bearing capacity of steel plate girders is 

also presented. 

Finally, general and specific conclusions reached throughout the thesis are presented in 

Chapter 10, together with suggestions for future research on the behaviour of steel plate 

girders subjected to shear buckling in fire situation.

2.1 Behaviour of plate girders under shear 

A literature review of relevant research on shear resistance of steel plate girders is 

presented in this Chapter. Plate girders are formed by isolated plates that can be 

supported in their ends and subjected to forces in its plane due to shear and bending. 

The behaviour of the girder is defined by the behaviour of these individual plates. The 

stresses caused by shear forces and bending moments in a plate girder are represented in 

Figure 2.1. The flanges are subjected to uniform normal stresses and the web is 

subjected to non-uniform normal stresses and tangential or shear stresses (Vila Real, 

2010). 

Thick stocky webs reach their ultimate shear strength by material yielding, while thin 

slender webs may be susceptible to the occurrence of out-of-plane shear buckling. 

However, limiting a web under shear stresses to its elastic buckling capacity ???  may be 

excessively conservative due to the additional post-critical strength reserve 

characteristic of plated elements (see Figure 2.2). The additional post-critical strength 

depends on the web slenderness, with larger gains obtained by plates where the material 

yield stress is significantly higher than the elastic critical buckling stress. Plate girders 

may be provided with transverse or longitudinal stiffeners to limit lateral deflections 

and thus increase the local buckling resistance.

Figure 2.2 – Post-critical response of slender webs (Beg et al., 2010) 

So the response of a web plate when subjected to shear can be divided in two different 

phases: before and after buckling. Before buckling, it is installed a combination of 

tensile and compressive stresses with equal magnitude (see Figure 2.3a). The principal 

compressive stress is the main responsible by the buckling of the web plate. After 

buckling, the buckled area of the web plate has no more compression capacity and a 

new load carrying mechanism develops, whereby the additional force is supported by 

the development of a tensile membrane stress field, the so-called “tension field” (see 

Figure 2.3b). But, it is only possible if the plate girder has capacity to anchor the tensile 

stresses. Some authors consider that when the capacity of tension field is reached, the 

flanges contribute to shear buckling resistance of the plate girder (see Figure 2.3c). 

The tension field in a girder with stiffeners is anchored by the flanges and the stiffeners. 

But, even plate girders without transverse stiffeners are capable to achieve an ultimate 

shear strength that is much higher than the shear buckling resistance of the web. It is 

also important to note that the flanges clearly bend inwards under the action of the 

tension field and its dimension and inclination is highly affected by the rigidity of the 

flanges (Porter et al., 1975). The tensile stress grows with the increasing of the applied 

loading until the tensile stress combined with the buckling stress reaches the steel yield 

stress. The final collapse occurs when the web has yielded and plastic hinges have 

formed in the flanges. 

As represented in Figure 2.3, most of the theories about the ultimate strength of plates 

subjected to shear buckling include three components (Eq. (2.1)):

? the load corresponding to tension field (??); 

? and, in some cases, the load corresponding to frame action (??): 

Vult = ??? + ?? + ??         (2.1) 

The critical load is the first component of shear resistance capacity and it is obtained 

using the linear theory of buckling as follows 

??? = ??  ??  ???          (2.2) 

The elastic critical buckling stress ???  can be obtained assuming buckling as an 

instability phenomenon by bifurcation of equilibrium, based in the following 

assumptions: 

i. Plate is perfectly plane; 

ii. Deflections due to buckling are moderate; 

iii. Plate is requested by loads applied at its middle plane; 

iv. Material with perfectly linear elastic behavior. 

Thus, the elastic critical buckling stress of a plate without imperfections can be taken as 

?cr = ?? ??          (2.3) 

where ??  is the Euler’s critical stress and it may be obtained by Eq. (2.4); the shear 

buckling coefficient ?? is defined by Eqs. (3.7) to (3.9).

2.2 Tension field models 

Design shear resistance of steel plate girders is very important, since it is widely used in 

construction. Significant experimental and analytical research has been performed over 

the past century and several tension field models have been developed. Basically, and as 

it was described before, the tension field is a membrane stress field that makes the 

ultimate shear strength of the girder higher than its shear buckling resistance. 

After buckling, the behaviour of a plate girder is similar to the behaviour of Pratt truss 

(see Figure 2.4). Diagonals support the tensile stresses and the posts resist to 

compressive stresses. In this analogy, each panel of a plate girder, limited by transverse 

stiffeners, acts as a module of Pratt truss. The web acts as a tensioned member, while 

transverse stiffeners act as compressed members to support the vertical component of 

tensile stresses that were developed on the web. Thus, it is assumed that transverse 

stiffeners are not loaded before the buckling occurrence and after buckling they are 

compressed (as the posts of Pratt truss). The horizontal component of tensile stresses is 

supported by the flanges of the adjacent panel.

Historically, the tension field contribution to the ultimate shear strength of thin plates 

was recognized for the first time by Wilson (1886). Two decades later, investigations of 

post-critical behaviour conducted by Foppl (1907) and von Karman (1910) showed that 

web plates normally possess a huge post-critical reserve, but it was mobilized only at 

very large deflections (Bazant, 2000). The development of aeronautical science 

stimulated the study of shear resistance capacity of membrane-type structures, such as 

aircrafts. The condition to design this type of structures – minimize the self-weight of 

the structure – led to the utilization of very slender webs, which resulted on the 

application of the tension field concept (Gervásio, 1998). 

According to Basler (1961a,1961b), the mathematical formulation of tension field effect 

was firstly presented by Rode (1916). The proposal consisted in evaluating the influence 

of tension field considering a tensile diagonal with a width equal to 50 times the web 

thickness (see Figure 2.5a). However, this theory was never used for design of plate 

girders because it was never experimentally tested. Later, Wagner (1931) presented the 

pure tension field theory (see Figure 2.5b) for girders with infinitely rigid flanges and 

very thin webs. Wagner developed his formulation based on the assumption that webs 

work as membranes with a uniform tension field, only supporting tensile forces.  

Since then, a lot of investigations were focused on the ultimate shear strength of plate 

girders considering partial tension fields. Lahde and Wagner (1936) published empirical 

data based on deflection measures of buckled rectangular plates. Levy et al. (1945, 

1946) studied the case of webs with transverse stiffeners forming square panels. 

Afterwards, several tests were conducted by the National Advisory Committee for 

Aeronautics (NACA) under coordination of Kuhn (1956). However, these initial studies 

were made with the aircraft design goal and had little applicability in the problems 

founded on design of plate girders in structures of buildings and bridges.

During sixties and seventies, the consideration of the post-buckling behaviour of plates 

loaded in shear was extended from aeronautical applications to civil engineering. 

Investigations on the post-buckling behaviour of web panels conducted by Basler and 

Thürlimann (1959a, 1959b) led the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) to 

adopt the formulation suggested by them (AISC, 1963). In contrast to the assumption of 

infinitely rigid flanges made by Wagner, Basler and Thürlimann assumed 

conservatively that flanges are too flexible and thus not capable to support the lateral 

loading from tension field. Thus, the tension field would be anchored only in transverse 

stiffeners. However, soon after the appearance of this model, experimental results 

shown big differences when compared to the results obtained with the theoretical 

model. First it was assumed it was because the formulation was excessively simplified, 

but the true motive was the no consideration of the flanges resistance. 

Since 1960, a lot of variations of the post buckling tension field have been developed 

following the Basler-Thürlimann model. Significant contributions were made by 

Rockey and Skaloud (1968, 1972) through experiments and analytical models. It was 

found that the post-buckling behaviour of a plate girder under shear loading was 

strongly influenced by the flexural rigidity of the flanges and the occurrence of collapse 

involved the formation of plastic hinges in both flanges. Based on these evidences, they 

proposed a method to predict the loads for which the webs of I cross-sections fail under 

shear, the so called Tension Field Method (Rockey et al., 1974). The precision of this 

model was established by comparisons with results of 58 tests obtained by various 

sources. These comparisons were summarized by Rockey et al. (1978).  

Between these two limit theories, many researchers have provided various tension field 

models to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders, incorporating 

different positions of the plastic hinges if they are involved in the solution, boundary 

conditions of the web panel assumed for calculation of shear buckling stress and 

distributions of tension field action. Among these, the most relevant are the theories 

presented by Takeuchi (1964), Chern and Ostapenko (1969), Fujii (1971), Komatsu 

(1971), Sharp and Clark (1971), Steinhardt and Schroter (1971), Höglund (1971a, 

1971b) and (Herzog, 1974). The main characteristics of these models are summarised in 

Table 2.1. More detailed information about them may be found in Galambos (1988).

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

20 

The Rockey’s Tension Field Method was adopted in the experimental version of Part 1-

1 of EC3 (IPQ, 1998) to calculate the ultimate shear strength of plate girders with 

transverse stiffeners. In this first version of Part 1-1 of EC3, it was also implemented the 

Simple Method of Post Critical Strength, a more conservative method that could be 

used for girders with or without transverse stiffeners. In this method the contribution of 

the flanges is not taken into account. Presently, these methods are no longer in the 

European Standards and the Rotated Stress Field Method developed by Höglund (1972) 

is the basis of the expressions adopted in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) for design of 

steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling. 

Rotated Stress Field Method is based on the assumption that the web panel is under a 

pure shear stress state that occurs preceding buckling. If these shear stresses ? were 

transformed in principal stresses, they would correspond to principal tensile stresses ?1 

and principal compressive stresses ?2 with equal magnitude (?1 = ?2) and inclined by 

45º relatively to the longitudinal axis of the girder. Once buckling occurs (? = ?cr), the 

web panel has no more compression capacity and it can be assumed that the principal 

compressive stresses (?2) remain equal to the elastic critical buckling stress (?cr). But, 

for webs in shear, there is a substantial post-critical reserve. After buckling, the web 

plate achieves the post-critical stress state, while a shear buckle forms in the direction of 

the principal tensile stresses (?1) and the increase of load is resisted by an increase in 

the principal tensile stresses (?1). As a result, stress values of different magnitude occur 

(?1 &gt; ?2) which, to keep the equilibrium, leads to a rotation of the stress field. This 

method is illustrated in Figure 2.6. Detailed information about it may be found in 

Höglund (1972, 1997).

In this model, the horizontal component of the tension field (??) acting across the web 

depth is resisted by the end panels, which act as beams resting on the girders flanges. 

These end panels, also called end posts, may be composed by pairs of transverse 

stiffeners placed in each side of the girder. They may be designed as rigid or non-rigid. 

Unlike other tension field models which are limited to specific aspect ratios (typically 

? ??? ? 3), the Rotated Stress Field Model may be applied for all aspect ratios and can 

be equally applied for stiffened and unstiffened plate girders. A reduction factor for the 

web contribution to shear buckling (??) is introduced to allow for initial imperfections 

observed in experimental tests. The predictions of the Rotated Stress Field Method were 

compared with experimental tests, as shown in Figure 2.7. A complete description of 

this method may be found in Höglund (1997). 

In the last years, the accuracy of these methods at normal temperature have been 

extensively analysed by Lee and his research group. The boundary conditions have been 

conservatively assumed as simply supported when calculating the elastic critical 

buckling stress, but Lee et al. (1996) stated that the real boundary conditions of the web 

panel should be considered in the formulations. Moreover, they concluded that the 

boundary conditions are highly influenced by the presence of the flanges (Lee &amp;amp; Yoo, 

1998). Recently, based on numerical investigations, Yoo and Lee (2006) found that 

compressive stresses may not remain constant over the web panel, but may increase 

progressively nearness the edges of the web panel where the out-of-plane deflections are 

smaller. It has also been found that Basler’s equation is not applicable to long web 

panels (? ?? ? 3? ) since it underestimates their post-buckling strength (Lee et al., 

2008).

2.3 Current state of research 

As already mentioned, the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders was widely 

studied at normal temperature. For that reason, researchers have been focusing their 

investigations over the past decade on different topics within the ultimate shear strength 

of plate girders, such as: design of stainless steel plate girders; interaction between shear 

and bending; and fire design of steel plate girders. 

Since the procedures for design of carbon steel structures subjected to shear buckling at 

normal temperature were well stablished, stainless steel has become the focus of the 

shear buckling study at normal temperature. Traditionally, the stainless steel design 

rules have been based on analogies with those adopted for carbon steel, with some 

adjustments made when necessary to fit with test results. Olsson (2001) provided a 

method based on the Rotated Stress Field Method with some modifications in the 

expressions for the calculation of the reduction factor for the web resistance to shear 

buckling and in the definition of the distance where the plastic hinges appear. This 

method was included in Part 1-4 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) for the design of stainless steel 

plate girders subjected to shear buckling.  

Experimental campaigns were carried out at Polytechnic University of Catalunya (UPC) 

to better understand the response of stainless steel plate girders under shear loading 

(Real at al., 2007). The comparative analysis of the experimental results with current 

codes’ prescriptions showed that shear design procedures are overly conservative 

(Estrada et al., 2007a). The experimental tests results were used by the same authors for 

calibration of numerical models, which were used in an extended numerical analysis 

carried out concerning the evaluation of the post-buckling strength in stainless steel 

plate girders (Estrada et al., 2007b). These experimental tests were also used for 

calibration of a numerical model for stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear 

buckling at elevated temperatures (Reis et al., 2016b). The numerical results also 

showed that the prescriptions present in EC3 for the design of stainless steel plate 

girders are too conservative, which led to the development of a new approach based on 

the Rotated Stress Field Method and adequately adapted to the particular features of 

stainless steel (Saliba et al., 2014), which was already accepted for incorporation in Part 

1-4 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a). 



Chapter 2. Literature review 

  23 

Recently, the interaction between shear and bending has also become a common topic 

on the research activities of several authors. Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) has adopted 

an expression for the verification of the shear-bending interaction in plate girders, which 

is based on slightly modified Basler’s approach (Basler et al., 1960; Basler, 1961b).  

Sinur and Beg (2013b) performed experimental tests to better understanding the 

behaviour of steel plate girders subjected to combination of shear force and bending 

moment and to get data for the validation of the numerical model in order to evaluate 

the reliability of the existing models (Sinur &amp;amp; Beg, 2013a). Longitudinally stiffened and 

unstiffened webs were considered. It was observed that the resistance strongly depends 

on the stress distribution in the sub-panels and on the rigidity of the longitudinal 

stiffeners. Graciano and Ayestarán (2013) concluded that the interaction between shear 

and bending may cause a significant reduction on the ultimate resistance of steel plate 

girders. Other authors as Kövesdi et al. (2014a, 2014b) also studied this topic 

considering longitudinally unstiffened and stiffened plate girders, resulting on the 

proposal of new design expressions. 

Despite the growing interest about the fire performance of steel plate girders affected by 

shear buckling, only limited experimental tests have been performed at elevated 

temperatures. Vimonsatit et al. (2007) were the first to perform fire resistance 

experimental tests in steel plate girders loaded in shear. They tested transversally 

stiffened plate girders with slender webs in a three-point bending configuration at 

normal temperature and under three different uniform temperatures: 400ºC, 550ºC and 

700ºC. Tension field action and formation of plastic hinges were observed. Elevated 

temperatures caused a reduction on the ultimate shear strength of approximately 15-

31% at 400ºC, 52-66% at 550ºC and 78-86% at 700ºC.  

Tan and Qian (2008) conducted similar tests but with addition of axial restrains in order 

to simulate the thermal restraint effects of adjacent cooler parts of steel-framed structure 

in fire. It was observed that the ultimate shear strength decreased significantly under a 

thermal restraint effect, mainly for the plate girders with more slender webs. These 

experiments are very important since they allow observing the significant degradation 

of the ultimate bearing capacity caused by exposing a steel plate girder to elevated 

temperatures such as those which occur during a fire. They are also important in 

confirming that the failure modes observed at normal temperature are also observed at 



Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

24 

elevated temperatures. Moreover, fire resistance experimental tests are crucial for the 

validation of numerical models used to perform extended parametric studies (Reis et al., 

2016a, 2016b). Thus, these fire resistance experimental tests were part of all 

experimental tests considered for the validation of the numerical model developed 

within the scope of the study of the shear buckling occurrence in steel plate girders 

exposed to fire (Reis et al., 2016c, 2016d). 

Vimonsatit et al. (2007a) conducted a numerical investigation using a numerical model 

duly validated with their fire resistance experimental tests. From this investigation a 

new model to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders subjected to 

elevated temperatures has been proposed. This model is based on Rockey’s model 

(Rockey et al., 1974) and considers the material properties in function of the 

temperature according to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b). In order to simplify, uniform 

temperature distribution is assumed within the full web depth. 

Numerical investigations conducted by Payá-Zaforteza and Garlock (2012) and Garlock 

and Glassman (2014) indicated that incorporating strain-hardening in material model 

had little effect on the ultimate shear strength and longitudinally restricted models 

deflected substantially less than those that were free. Furthermore, it was possible to 

observe the development of thermal gradients across the cross-section depth.  

A numerical study about thin steel plates loaded in shear at non-uniform elevated 

temperatures was performed by Scandella et al. (2014) in which it was shown that the 

non-uniform temperatures can impose additional loading and even chance the failure 

mode. The large differences between the flanges and web thicknesses can lead to a 

faster heating in the web than flanges, resulting in the development of thermally 

induced compressive stresses in the web, which will accelerate the local failure. Thus, a 

steel plate girder with a bending dominant failure at normal temperature may instead 

exhibit a shear dominant failure at elevated temperatures with non-uniform heating. 

However, it is important do not forget the difficulty of implementing in the European 

Standards a simple calculation method that includes non-uniform temperatures. 

A new design method for predicting the shear resistance of thin steel plate at non-

uniform elevated temperatures has been proposed by Salminen and Heinisuo (2014). 

The basic idea of the method is to reduce the ultimate shear strength of the plate based 

on a reference temperature, which is hotter than the average temperature but colder than 



Chapter 2. Literature review 

  25 

the maximum temperature. The authors suggested that non-uniform temperature 

distributions should be converted into an equivalent uniform temperature, which 

highlights the importance to use simple design methods giving safe predictions.  

Although this Chapter is mainly focused on the behaviour of plate girders under shear 

loading, it is important to note that in practice plate girders also require bending 

resistance and the shear-bending interaction should also be taken into account. 

Furthermore, although it has been tried to refer all the essential studies, others relevant 

research works may have been unconsciously omitted.

Chapter 3 Eurocode design rules 

3.1 General considerations 

In order to better understand the design formulation proposed in EC3, in first place it is 

important to understand what a plated structure is: “A plated structure is a structure 

built up from nominally flat plates which are connected together; the plates may be 

stiffened or unstiffened” (CEN, 2006b). 

This section dedicated to the design procedures is divided in several parts dealing with 

different topics. In the first part it is presented the design rules according to Part 1-5 of 

EC3 (CEN, 2006b) to determinate the design shear resistance at normal temperatures. 

The second part is dedicated to the interaction between the shear force and the bending 

moment. On the third part some considerations about stiffeners are made and finally, it 

is presented the methodology adopted to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate 

girders under fire, based on Parts 1-2 (CEN, 2010b) and 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). 

3.2 Shear resistance 

As mentioned before, Torsten Höglund developed the so-called Rotated Stress Field 

Method (Höglund, 1972) which was implemented in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) 

with some modifications (Höglund, 1997). Originally, it was developed for girders with 

web stiffeners at the supports only, because the other existing methods were very 

conservative for this case. It has in consideration the resistance from the web to shear 

buckling and the resistance contribution from the flanges to the same instability 

phenomenon, which are obtained separately. The web resistance to shear buckling 

includes a reduction factor to account for different features which influence the bearing 

capacity of the girders, as for example the initial imperfections. This reduction factor 

depends on the girder end posts: rigid or non-rigid. Girders with rigid end posts are 

supposed to reach higher ultimate loads. 

According to Part 1-5 of EC3, the shear buckling resistance has to be checked when the 

following conditions are satisfied:

In case these limits are exceeded, the girder should be provided with transverse 

stiffeners at the supports. 

The design shear resistance (??,??) is taken as a sum of the resistance from the web to 

shear buckling (???,??) and the flanges contribution (???,??). However, the design shear 

resistance cannot be higher than the plastic shear resistance of the web alone, as 

presented in in Eq. (3.1).

? = 1.2 for ?? ? 460 MPa 

 ? = 1.0 for ?? &gt; 460 MPa  
        (3.2) 

It is important to note that the National Annexes of EC3 may give different values for ?, 

depending on the field of application. 

3.2.1 Resistance from the web to shear buckling 

The contribution from the web to shear buckling resistance may be obtained as follows 

???,?? = ??  ??  ??  
???

?3 ??1
        (3.3) 

The reduction factor for the web contribution to shear buckling resistance is valid for 

both unstiffened and stiffened webs and may be obtained from Table 3.1. This reduction 

factor is also plotted in Figure 3.1 in function of the web slenderness parameter, 

depending on the end supports (see Figure 3.2).  

As shown in Figure 3.1, ?? can take values larger than 1.0 for plate girders with steel 

yield strength up to 460 MPa due to strain hardening. Tests on stocky beams showed, 

for this range of steel yield strength, that the ultimate shear strength may reach 70% to 

80% of the tensile yield strength, which corresponds approximately to an increase of 

20% of the shear yield strength. It may be accepted since it does not lead to excessive 

deformations (Beg et al., 2010).

As it was said before, the reduction factor for the web contribution to shear buckling can 

be applied for the verification of both unstiffened and stiffened webs. The web 

slenderness parameter ???? is determined using Eq. (3.4) for unstiffened webs. In case of 

a stiffened panel, the ????  largest value of all sub-panels should be used. To simplify the 

application of Eq. (3.4) to stiffened panels, ???? can be obtained by Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6).

information about stiffeners is presented later in this Chapter.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

34 

During the calculation of the shear buckling coefficient (??), a reduction of the moment 

of inertia of the longitudinal stiffener (??? ) to 1/3 of its actual value is required. 

Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9) already take this reduction into account. However, some 

investigations (Kuhlmann et al., 2007; Pavlov?i? et al., 2007) have shown that such 

reduction is only necessary for stiffeners with a small torsional rigidity (e.g. flat bar 

stiffeners). Concerning longitudinal stiffeners with large torsional rigidity (e.g. 

trapezoidal shaped stiffeners), the actual value of the moment of inertia may be 

considered (Beg et al., 2010). 

Part 1-5 of EC3 has verification schemes for the case of utilization of intermediate non-

rigid transverse stiffeners, but no formulas are given to determinate the shear buckling 

coefficients for girders provided with this type of stiffeners, with exception of girders 

provided with non-rigid transverse stiffeners at supports only. One solution to this lack 

of guidance is to calculate the shear buckling coefficient using adequate software. 

However, it is important to note that, in modern steel structures, intermediate non-rigid 

transverse stiffeners are rarely applied in practice, since the increase of strength may be 

very low. Even intermediate rigid transverse stiffeners are not widely used, because 

their utilization normally does not compensate the additional cost of welding. 

3.2.2 Contribution from the flanges 

The flanges contribution to shear buckling resistance is given Eq. (3.11), which assumes 

the formation of four plastic hinges in the flanges at the distance ? (see Figure 3.5).

3.3 Interaction between shear and bending 

Clause 7 of Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) states that the shear-bending interaction 

should be checked and satisfy Eq. (3.17) when the two following criteria are satisfied:

in which ???,?? is the design plastic resistance of the cross-section, considering the 

effective area of the flanges and the fully effective web, irrespective of its section class. 

Note that the bending resistance also needs to be checked, according to point 4.6 of Part 

1-5 of EC3. Therefore, in the case of sections with Class 1 or 2, the interaction curve 

given by Eq. (3.17) must be truncated by the vertical line that cuts the horizontal axis in 

???,?? (see Figure 3.7), the plastic resistance bending moment. Regarding sections with 

Class 3 or 4, it should be truncated by the vertical line that cuts the horizontal axis in 

??,?? (see Figure 3.8), the elastic resistance bending moment or the effective resistance 

bending moment, respectively.

It is worth mentioning that ???,?? in Figure 3.7 is the full plastic moment of the gross 

cross-section, but in Figure 3.8 it is the design plastic resistance of the cross-section 

consisting of the effective area of the flanges and the fully effective web, irrespective of 

its section class. 

3.4 Stiffeners 

The webs of plate girders are usually reinforced with transverse and longitudinal 

stiffeners. Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) gives, in section 9, design rules for stiffeners 

in plated structures and other detailing rules that are important for the evaluation of the 

plate buckling resistance. 

Figure 3.9 shows the most common situations where transverse and longitudinal 

stiffeners are used to increase the resistance of plated structural elements subjected to 

different types of loading, such as: direct stresses, shear stresses, patch loading, etc. In 

some cases, the stiffeners design is integrated into the design of the plated elements and, 

in other cases, separate checks need to be made (Beg et al., 2010). Figure 3.10 shows 

some typical shapes of stiffeners cross-sections. For individual design, the cross-section 

of a transverse or longitudinal stiffener may be taken as the gross area of the stiffener

itself (??) plus the contributing width of the plate equal to 15?? on each side of the 

stiffener. This width should not be more than the actual dimension available, avoiding

Figure 3.11 – Effective cross-section of stiffeners (Beg et al., 2010) 

Normally, transverse stiffeners are flat bars or T profiles. Intermediate transverse 

stiffeners are usually single-sided, unless they support large concentrated forces, while 

the stiffeners at supports are always double-sided to avoid eccentricity at the 

introduction of large reaction forces (Beg et al., 2010). By another hand, longitudinal 

stiffeners have frequently a closed trapezoidal shape because of it great torsional 

rigidity, but they can also be open flat bars, T or L shape profiles (see Figure 3.10).

Chapter 3. Eurocode design rules 

  41 

The cross-sections of open stiffeners are always designed as Class 3 cross-sections or 

lower to ensure adequate stiffness. Generally this rule is also applied to closed 

stiffeners. However, some new concepts in the design of stiffened plates led to the 

choice of a smaller number of large trapezoidal stiffeners instead of a large number of 

smaller stiffeners. In this case, it may happen that the stiffener belongs to a Class 4 

cross-section, which must be considered in the design procedure. 

3.4.1 Transverse stiffeners 

Transverse stiffeners have many functions. The most important is to increase the shear 

resistance, but they also ensure lateral supports to longitudinal stiffeners and provide 

support to concentrated transverse forces, being therefore frequently applied at supports 

and load points to prevent web crippling. They are commonly designed as rigid 

stiffeners and consequently the panels between two rigid transverse stiffeners can be 

designed individually without interaction with adjacent panels. In Part 1-5 of EC3 are 

given prescriptions for the design of rigid transverse stiffeners. However, it does not 

give detailed information for the design of flexible transverse stiffeners. 

Furthermore, transverse stiffeners should be able to support the deviation forces 

originated from the longitudinal compressive forces of the adjacent panels (NEd), caused 

by the inevitable geometrical imperfections. These deviation forces induce out of plane 

bending (see Figure 3.12). Transverse stiffeners should be designed not only for 

strength but also for stiffness in order to provide rigid support for the plate. Based on a 

second order analysis, the following criteria should be satisfied (Beg et al., 2010; 

Johansson et al., 2007; CEN, 2006b): 

? maximum stress in the stiffener at the ultimate limit state should not exceed the 

yield strength (???? ?
??

??1
); 

? additional lateral deflection ? at the ultimate limit state should not exceed 

b/300. 

The scheme used for the verification of transverse stiffeners subjected to direct stresses 

is present in Figure 3.12. The transverse stiffener under checking has a sinusoidal 

geometric imperfection with amplitude w0. Both adjacent stiffeners need to be straight 

and rigid. The adjacent compressed panels, including longitudinal stiffeners, are 

considered to be simply supported along the transverse stiffeners.  



Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

42 

 

Figure 3.12 – Scheme for rigid transverse stiffeners (Beg et al., 2010; Johansson et al., 2007) 

Regarding shear, transverse stiffeners are influenced in two different ways. At the plate 

buckling, rigid transverse stiffeners should prevent the lateral movements of the plate at 

the stiffener position. Thus, adjacent transverse stiffeners should have appropriate 

stiffness. Normally, the verification of stiffeners is made only for intermediate 

stiffeners, because by definition the stiffeners placed at supports are much stronger. On 

post-buckling state, tension field action subject transverse stiffeners to additional axial 

forces and induces additional bending moments at the plate girder end posts due to the 

anchorage of the tension field. Separate checks for additional axial forces are necessary 

only at intermediate transverse stiffeners, since at stiffeners above the supports all axial 

actions are taken into account in the reaction forces considered relevant for their design. 

In the most general case (see Figure 3.13), a transverse stiffener may be loaded with: 

? a transverse deviation force (qdev), originated from the longitudinal compressive 

force of the adjacent panels (NEd); 

? an external transverse loading (qEd)  in the horizontal direction; 

? a compressive force in transverse stiffener (Nst,ext), coming from the external 

transverse loads; 

? a compressive force (Nst,ten) in intermediate transverse stiffener due to the 

tension field action. 

More information about design of transverse stiffeners may be found in (Beg et al., 

2010; Johansson et al., 2007).

3.4.1.1 Rigid end posts 

Rigid end posts should have the form of a vertical I profile at the end of the girder. Two 

double-sided stiffeners can be used for this purpose (Beg et al., 2010). Figure 3.14 

shows some details of a rigid end post.

where ? is the centre to centre distance between the stiffeners (see Figure 3.14). 

The second stiffener of an end post with cross-section Au should be checked also as a 

bearing stiffener to carry the reaction force R. 

When end posts are made with inserted profiles, the section modulus of such profiles 

should not be less than 4?? ?
2, considering bearing around the horizontal axis 

perpendicular to the web.  

3.4.1.2 Non-rigid end posts 

When design criteria for rigid end posts are not satisfied, the end post should be 

considered as non-rigid. A non-rigid end post consists on the application of a transverse 

stiffener on the reaction point. Generally, a single double-sided stiffener may be used as 

non-rigid end post. Figure 3.15 shows an example of a typical configuration of a non-

rigid end post, where it may act as bearing stiffener for the reaction.

An intermediate transverse stiffener is considered rigid for shear buckling of the plate if 

the following conditions are satisfied:

where ???  is the moment of inertia of an intermediate transverse stiffener with a cross-

section according to Figure 3.11, for the parallel axis to the web plate. Normally, the 

results given by the expressions presented above do not lead to very strong stiffeners. 

The tension field action imposes an axial force Nst,ten in the intermediate transverse 

stiffener that may be determined as follows 

???,??? = ??? ?

?3 ??1
       (3.18) 

At variable shear forces, ??? is taken at the distance 0.5 ??  from the edge of the panel 

with the largest shear force (see Figure 3.16). Note that the values given by Eq. (3.18) 

are very conservative (by a factor 2 or more) and overestimates the level of the axial 

force (Beg et al., 2010). This may be problematic, mainly for single-sided stiffeners 

where eccentric introduction of the axial force should be taken into account. When 

Eq. (3.18) gives a negative value, the axial force Nst,ten should be considered equal to 0.

3.4.2 Longitudinal stiffeners 

Longitudinal stiffeners are used to increase the shear resistance, the resistance to direct 

stresses or the resistance to patch loading (see Figure 3.9). Typically they are designed 

to be most effective. Generally this is achieved when an increase in resistance of the 

stiffener’s cross-section does not result in a significant strength enhancement by the 

stiffened plate. When stiffened plates are loaded in shear, no special design checks are 

needed for longitudinal stiffeners. Their influence is considered when calculating the 

shear buckling coefficient ??of the stiffened panel (Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9)). 

3.5 Design at elevated temperatures 

As presented, the ultimate shear strength at normal temperature of steel plate girders is 

obtained according to Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). In the European Standards there is 

one part that is dedicated to structural fire design of steel structures, Part 1-2 (CEN, 

2010b). However, no guidance is given in Part 1-2 of EC3 for the shear buckling 

evaluation in fire situation. Thus, the design prescriptions at normal temperature, 

adapted to fire situation by the direct application of the reduction factors for the stress-

strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures, are used. The reduction factors used 

in this procedure are presented in Table 3.2 and plotted in Figure 3.17. The reduction 

factor to reduce the steel yield strength at elevated temperatures of profiles with Class 4 

cross-sections, given in Annex E of Part 1-2 of EC3, is also presented. 

When checking the ultimate shear strength in fire situation, ??,? is used to consider the 

reduction of the steel yield strength caused by the elevated temperatures, whereas ??,? 

is applied to reduce the Young’s modulus in Eq. (3.19) (Franssen &amp;amp; Vila Real, 2010), 

for the calculation of the parameter ?? necessary for obtaining the web slenderness 

parameter at elevated temperatures ????,?. Finally, ?0.2?,? is used for Class 4 cross-

sections to consider the reduction of the flanges resistance to the bending moment at 

elevated temperatures. It is important to note that ??,? is only used to build the 

constitutive law presented in Figure 4.3.

Chapter 4 Numerical modelling 

4.1 Model description 

4.1.1 FEM model 

In engineering practice, the resistance of steel plate girders can be determined in 

different ways, i.e. by means of experimental tests, computer simulations or using 

available formulae in design codes. Herein, the ultimate shear strength of steel plate 

girders is calculated by means of non-linear finite element analysis and then the 

numerical values are compared with the codes predictions in the next Chapters. 

The 3-D models for steel plate girders loaded in a three-point bending were developed 

using the FEM software SAFIR (Franssen, 2005, 2011), a computer software developed 

at University of Liege for the simulation of the behaviour of structures subjected to fire. 

The plates of the web, flanges and stiffeners were discretized into several quadrangular 

shell elements with 4 integration nodes and 6 degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 

rotations). These shell elements adopt the Kirchhoff's theory formulation and have been 

previously validated by Talamona and Franssen (2005).  

A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to find the necessary mesh refinement to 

obtain reliable results (see Figure 4.1). A mesh refinement with 30 elements in the web, 

10 elements in the flanges and 100 divisions per meter of beam length, which amounts 

to 5000 finite elements per meter of beam length, was considered adequate to accurately 

represent the beam behaviour, as marked with a circle in Figure 4.1. The integration on 

the shell element follows a Gauss scheme with 4 nodes on the surface and 4 levels 

through the thickness. 

The boundary conditions are presented in Table 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4.2. Lateral 

torsional buckling was prevented through the application of lateral bracings in the upper 

flange equidistantly at L/10 (see Figure 4.2). The loading were applied to the model as 

forces at mid-span, distributed on the entire web depth in order to avoid numerical 

problems (see Figure 4.5). The plate girders were always provided with transverse 

stiffeners at the load points, i.e. at the girder ends and at mid-span.

4.1.2 Material model 

The bi-linear material model with a yielding plateau was used in the analyses at 20ºC, 

according to Annex C of Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). For elevated temperatures with 

heating rates between 2 and 50ºC/min, the steel mechanical properties of resistance and 

deformability may be obtained according to the recommendations presented in Clause 

3.2.2 of Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b). The parameters given in Table 4.2 are the 

parameters involved on the determination of the steel stress-strain relationship at 

elevated temperatures presented in Figure 4.3, which was the steel material law 

considered in the numerical modelling. Strain-hardening was not considered in the steel 

material law at both normal and elevated temperatures.  

At elevated temperatures, the shape of the stress-strain curve is modified compared to 

the shape at room temperature. However, it is important to note that the bi-linear 

constitutive law with a yielding plateau and without strain-hardening used for normal 

temperature is compatible with the constitutive law for elevated temperatures, meaning 

that at 20ºC they are the same. At 20ºC ?,pf  is equal to yf  resulting in ?? ?? ,, yp ? , 

which leads to not having the transition phase that follows the equation of an ellipse and 

having again an elastic-plastic law without strain hardening. 

The stress-strain steel curve at elevated temperatures may be divided into four zones: 

? the first is a linear zone until the proportional limit. This relation can be 

described by the Hooke law with the modulus of elasticity ??,?; 

? the second is a transition phase that follows the equation of an ellipse (Rubert &amp;amp; 

Schaumann, 1985) and stops at the yield strength, considered as the stress at 2 % 

of total strain. This phase corresponds to the beginning of the yielding; 

? the third represents the yield (plastic zone), characterized by values of constant 

stresses equal to the yield strength; 

? the fourth zone relates to a linear decreasing branch, which was introduced to 

represent the softening of the steel and to achieve finite numerical ductility.

for temperatures larger than 400ºC. Figure 4.4b shows in more detail the elastic-elliptic-

perfectly plastic model of the stress-strain curve at elevated temperatures. 

In an accidental limit state as fire, higher strains are acceptable. Therefore, EC3 

recommends a yield strength corresponding to 2% total strain instead of the 0.2% proof 

strength. However, for members with Class 4 cross-sections, EC3 recommends design 

yield strength based on the 0.2% proof strength.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

4.1.3 Initial imperfections 

4.1.3.1 Geometric imperfections 

Steel plate girders are not perfectly straight because of the geometric imperfections 

resulting from the production and fabrication process, which may cause a significant 

reduction on the ultimate bearing capacity of steel plate girders and consequently it is 

imperative to take them into account in the numerical modelling. 

In this work, the initial geometric imperfections were incorporated into the numerical 

model by modifying the nodal coordinates. As the global buckling was restrained by the 

application of lateral bracings in the upper flange, only local imperfections were 

considered. The shape for the geometric imperfections was taken as the first eigenmode 

of a linear buckling analysis. A procedure written in CAST3M (CEA, 2012) was used to 

obtain the eigenmodes, being the interface between SAFIR and CAST3M assured by 

RUBY (Couto et al., 2013). Figure 4.5 shows an example of the shape of a first 

eigenmode resulting from a linear buckling analysis. 

Regarding the maximum amplitude considered for the geometric imperfections, two 

different situations need to be considered. On the one hand, if one is modelling 

experimental tests, the pattern of the geometric imperfections observed in the 

experiments should be taken into account. When the geometric imperfections were not 

measured in the experimental test, a maximum amplitude of the geometric 

imperfections equal to tw/10 was considered on the simulation of the experimental tests 

for the validation of the numerical model, as used in different studies of plate buckling 

at normal temperature (Hancock, 1981; Real et al., 2007) and at elevated temperature 

(Quiel &amp;amp; Garlock, 2010). 

On the other hand, if one is evaluating the accuracy of design expressions adopted in the 

European Standards, the worst case scenario should be considered. Therefore, the 

maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is generally more severe in 

numerical studies concerning the evaluation of design expressions, when compared to 

the one used for modelling of experimental tests. Thus, in the parametric numerical 

studies performed in this thesis, the maximum amplitude was considered equal to 80% 

of the essential manufacturing tolerances for welded profiles, obtained from EN 1090-2 

(CEN, 2011), as recommended in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). Accordingly, the 



Chapter 4. Numerical modelling 

  57 

maximum amplitude considered for the geometric imperfections was 0.8bf/100 in the 

flanges and 0.8hw/100 in the web.

4.1.3.2 Residual stresses 

Despite the effect of the residual stresses on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate 

girders subjected to elevated temperatures has little influence (Quiel &amp;amp; Garlock, 2010), 

the residual stresses were introduced into the numerical modelling because they affect 

the ultimate shear strength at normal temperature (see Figure 4.7). The pattern of 

residual stresses considered is depicted in Figure 4.6, with the values of the residual 

stresses according to (ECCS, 1976, 1984).

4.2 Validation of the numerical model 

4.2.1 Review of experimental tests 

4.2.1.1 Normal temperature 

In 1999, an experimental study of steel plate girders with non-rigid end posts was 

performed by Lee and Yoo (1999). A shear dominant failure mode characterized by the 

web shear buckling was observed. The girders were simply supported and the loading 

was applied at mid-span. Figure 4.8 shows the geometry of the tested girders. The 

girders dimensions and the material properties are presented in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4, 

respectively. The width of the transverse stiffeners is half of the flanges width and the 

horizontal dimension of the two small end panels is 300 mm. All transverse stiffeners 

have 6 mm thickness (??) with exception of those placed at the supports forming the 

non-rigid end post which have 10 mm thickness.

Other experimental campaign performed at the University of Minho (Gomes et al., 

2000) tested a total of six plate girders with non-rigid end posts divided into two series 

of three girders each. The girders from the first series only had transverse stiffeners, 

spaced by 300, 600 and 900 mm (see Figure 4.9). In the second series, a longitudinal 

stiffener was added to each girder tested in the first series. The longitudinal stiffener 

was placed 60 mm from the bottom surface of the upper flange. Table 4.3 shows the 

dimensions of the tested girders. The steel mechanical properties are presented in Table 

4.4. The steel yield strength and the Young’s modulus were obtained from tensile tests, 

using for this 18 samples from the 6 steel plates, 3 samples for each.

4.2.1.2 Elevated temperatures 

In 2007, an experimental campaign at normal and elevated temperature was carried out 

at Nanyang Technological University (Vimonsatit et al., 2007b). This was the first 

reported experimental work under elevated temperatures in the scope of shear buckling 

in steel plate girders. A total of 18 plate girders were tested, divided into five series. 

Beams with stocky hot-rolled cross-sections were tested in the two first series and for 

this reason they are not studied in this work. Only two series involving 8 plate girders 

with slender web panels that fail by shear are modelled in this thesis, since some 

technical problems were registered in one of the experimental series and the results 

were not good. The girders are simply supported and the loading is applied at the mid-

span. They were tested at elevated temperatures in electrical heating furnaces under 

steady-state conditions. The temperature was applied uniformly until the girder reached 

the specified temperature and after that the loading was applied until failure. The 

geometry of the girders is presented in Figure 4.10. The thickness of the flange stiffener 

is 12 mm and a same thickness for the transverse stiffeners was assumed. The 

dimensions and the material properties of the girders are presented in Table 4.5 and 

Table 4.6, respectively.

4.2.2 Comparisons between numerical and experimental results 

4.2.2.1 Normal temperature 

The steel plate girders tested by Lee and Yoo (1999) were numerically modelled using 

the SAFIR software. The results are presented in Table 4.7. It is shown that the ultimate 

load of the analysed plate girders is very well predicted by the numerical model. The 

average deviation between the numerical and the experimental tests was 1.5%. It was 

calculated in absolute. As it can be seen in Table 4.7, the maximum conservative 

deviation was 2.8% and the maximum not conservative deviation was 1.7%. 

The out of plane web buckling observed in PG2 is illustrated in Figure 4.11. Figures 

4.12 and 4.13 show the web buckling at the end of the test of plate girders with aspect 

ratio equal to 1.5 and 2.0, respectively. As shown in these figures, the failure modes 

numerically obtained are quite similar to those observed in the experimental tests, 

particularly the web shear buckling and the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges.

The experimental tests performed at University of Minho (Gomes et al., 2000) were also 

numerically modelled in SAFIR. The ultimate loads obtained in the experimental tests 

are compared with those resulting from the numerical model. The results are presented 

in Table 4.8. Through the comparison of results it is possible to observe that the 

numerical model provides a good aproximation to the actual behaviour of the tested 

girders, with an average deviation equal to 4.1%. The average deviation was determined 

in absolute. Table 4.8 shows a maximum conservative deviation of 9.7% and a 

maximum not conservative deviation of 4.9%, which is considered acceptable. Figure 

4.14 shows the similarity between the failure modes observed after the numerical and 

experimental tests of PG13, a plate girder provided with a longitudinal stiffener. The 

shear buckling in the web panel may be observed in both experimental and numerical 

tests. Moreover, flange buckling may also be observed.

The graphical comparison between the numerical and experimental results of all the 

analysed plate girders at normal temperature is presented in Figure 4.15. The differences 

are always lower than 10%, most of the times on the safe side. The differences are 

larger than 3% in four simulations only (PG10, PG11, PG14, PG19) and just two 

registered a difference larger than 5% (PG14 and PG19). So, it may be concluded that 

there is a very good agreement between the numerical and experimental results, in terms 

of both ultimate loads and deformed shape at failure.

4.2.2.2 Elevated temperatures 

Fire resistance experimental tests were conducted at Nanyang Technological University 

in Singapore (Vimonsatit et al., 2007b). These tests were also numerically reproduced 

by Vimonsatit et al. (2007b) using the MARC software (MSC, 2001). The ultimate 

loads of the overall test results are presented in Table 4.9, as well as a comparison 

between the numerical and the experimental results. A good agreement between the 

results of the numerical model developed in SAFIR and the experiments was obtained.  

From the results at normal temperature (PG15 and PG19), an average deviation between 

SAFIR and the experimental tests equal to 4.6% was observed, whereas the results 

obtained from the authors using MARC software presented a 13.8% average deviation

when compared with the experimental tests. Comparing the results at elevated 

temperatures (PG16-18 and PG20-22), SAFIR presents an average deviation of 4.2% 

when compared with the experimental tests, whereas an average deviation equal to 

10.4% was observed between MARC and the experiments.  

Therefore, it can be said that SAFIR provides results generally on the safe side agreeing 

well with the experiments. Figure 4.16 and Figure 4.17 show the similarity on the web 

shear buckling observed in the experimental tests and numerical simulations for two of 

the analysed plate girders. Finally, the experimental and numerical results obtained at 

elevated temperatures are plotted in Figure 4.18. 

It was shown that the numerical model developed in SAFIR provides a good 

approximation to the actual behaviour of steel plate girders at both normal and elevated 

temperatures. Therefore, the numerical model is considered duly validated.

on the ultimate shear strength has been performed. Different maximum amplitudes of 

the geometric imperfections were considered based on the web thickness (tw, tw/2, tw/10 

and tw/100), as well as the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 (0.8bf/100 in the 

flanges and 0.8hw/100 in the web), as stated in section 4.1.3.1.  

The results are presented in Table 4.10 listed from highest to lowest maximum 

amplitude. As expected, the higher the maximum amplitude is, the more conservative 

the results are. Comparing numerical and experimental results, the average deviation is 

4.6% on safe side when the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 is used. When 

the maximum amplitude is taken as 10% of the web thickness the average deviation is 

0.9% on the safe side. Finally, considering a maximum amplitude equal to 1% of the 

web thickness is too soft, being the average deviation 1.2% on the unsafe side, i.e. the 

ultimate loads numerically obtained are generally higher than those observed in the 

experimental tests. Furthermore, the consideration of the maximum amplitude 

recommended in EC3 is too severe for the numerical modelling of experimental tests, 

being tw/10 an appropriate value to use for that purpose.

4.3.1.2 Elevated temperatures 

The influence of the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections was also 

analysed under fire conditions using the same plate girders analysed at normal 

temperature (see Table 4.11). In this case, the plate girders are subjected to three 

different uniform temperatures (350ºC, 500ºC and 600ºC) under steady-state conditions, 

i.e. the temperature is considered constant while the load is increased. Two different

maximum amplitudes were considered: the one used in the modelling of experimental 

tests and the one recommended in EC3. It was found that considering geometric 

imperfections causes a significant reduction on the ultimate shear strength and not 

considering them conducts to unrealistic shear buckling resistances. However, at 

elevated temperatures the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections has no 

significant influence on the ultimate capacity of the analysed plate girders. The average 

deviation is equal to 0.6% for all the analysed temperatures.

4.3.2 Residual stresses 

4.3.2.1 Normal temperature 

The authors of the experimental tests did not measure the residual stresses and therefore, 

they were not considered in the validation of the numerical model. However, in this 

section their influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders is evaluated. 

For taking the residual stresses into account, SAFIR transform them into residual strains 

and add them to the other strains in the first calculation (Franssen, 1993; Lopes et al., 

2010). The pattern of residual stresses considered was the one presented in Figure 4.6. 

One may observe that the influence of the residual stresses on the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plate girders is high, with the ultimate loads of the analysed girders on 

average 8.6% lower when a maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections equal 

to tw/10 is used. When a higher maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is 

considered, like the one recommended in EC3, the reduction on the ultimate loads is not 

so high, being on average 5.3%.

4.3.2.2 Elevated temperatures 

As performed in the sensitivity analysis of the geometric imperfections, herein the plate 

girders were also subjected to a uniform temperature equal to 500ºC under steady-state 

conditions. Table 4.13 shows the influence of the residual stresses on the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plate girders subjected to elevated temperatures. It is shown that there 

is no substantial reduction on the ultimate loads of the analysed plate girders and, 

consequently, one can conclude that the residual stresses do not need to be taken into 

account on the numerical analysis of steel plate girders subjected to elevated 

temperatures.  

The results showed that residual stresses are not so important for the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plate girders exposed to fire. Tide (1998) and Quiel and Garlock (2010) 

affirm that a relaxation of initial residual stresses is likely to occur when a steel member 

is exposed to fire due to an increase in steel temperature. However, it is important 

bearing in mind that the evolution of the residual stresses when a profile is exposed to 

fire is not very well known and their influence may not be always considered 

appropriately in the numerical calculation (Franssen, 1993).

4.4 Conclusions 

Based on the work presented in Chapter 4, the following general conclusions are drawn: 

? The numerical model developed in SAFIR is able to accurately reproduce the 

behaviour of steel plate girders under shear loading at both normal and elevated 

temperatures; 

? Do not have into account the geometric imperfections conduct to unrealistic 

shear buckling resistances; 

? The maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections has significant 

influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders analysed at normal 

temperature. However, it is not relevant in fire situation; 

? The higher the maximum amplitude is, the more conservative the results are; 

? The application of the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 is too severe for 

the numerical modelling of experimental tests. An appropriate value to use for that 

purpose is tw/10; 

? Residual stresses cause a considerable reduction of bearing capacity of steel plate 

girders affected by shear buckling at normal temperature. However, they have no 

substantial influence at elevated temperatures.

5.1 Characteristics of the analysed plate girders 

The main objective of the parametric study is to evaluate the accuracy of the design 

expressions implemented in EC3 to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate 

girders affected by shear buckling, which includes the web resistance to shear buckling, 

the flanges contribution and the interaction between shear and bending. With this 

purpose, four groups of simply supported steel plate girders have been analysed. Steel 

plate girders with rigid and non-rigid end posts have been considered, while steel plate 

girders with no end posts were not considered because they are affected by web 

crippling, which is out of the scope of this thesis. 

The first group was designed to assess the accuracy of the expressions used to obtain the 

contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. Simply supported 2-

panels plate girders were considered (see Figure 5.1). The girders were provided with 

double-sided transverse stiffeners at load points (supports and mid-span). The web 

thickness was fixed (tw=4 mm) and the flanges thickness was ranged between 12 and 

20 mm. For the web depth, values between 800 and 1600 mm were considered. The 

girder length was chosen to achieve the desired aspect ratios (a/hw), which varied from 

0.5 up to 3.0. Thus, the girder length, which is twice the transverse stiffeners spacing, 

ranged between 0.8 and 9.6 m. Table 5.1 shows the geometrical dimensions considered 

for the girders analysed in group I, which are illustrated in Figure 5.2a.  

The properties of the second group of plate girders were quite similar to group I. Figure 

5.1a shows de geometry of the plate girders with non-rigid end posts, whereas the 

geometry of the plate girders with rigid end posts is presented in Figure 5.1b. The 

differences between group I and II are related to the web and flanges thicknesses. With 

this group of girders it was intended to analyse the shear buckling resistance. For that 

purpose, the plate girders were provided with strong flanges (tf=20 mm) in order to have 

a shear dominant failure in almost all of the girders. The web thickness was ranged 

between 4 and 10 mm, as presented in Table 5.2. For an easier understanding, Figure 

5.2b shows the cross-section of the girders belonging to group II. 

Regarding material properties, the steel grade S235 was considered for groups I and II 

and the Young’s modulus at normal temperature was considered equal to 210 GPa.

In the third group of this parametric study, it was intended to study 4-panels and 6-

panels plate girders in addition to the 2-panels plate girders analysed in the two first 

groups. Simply supported plate girders with rigid and non-rigid end posts were 

considered. The rigid end post was formed by two stiffeners placed at the end supports 

spaced by 100 mm. The thickness of these end stiffeners is the same as the intermediate 

transverse stiffeners. Figure 5.3 shows the geometric configuration of the girders with 

rigid end posts. The geometric configuration of the girders with non-rigid end posts is 

the same presented in Figure 5.3, if removed the two end stiffeners (one in each side of 

the girder). The girder length was 1.8 m and different distances between transverse 

stiffeners were considered (300, 450, 600 and 900 mm), as presented in Figure 5.3.  

Nine different cross-sections were analysed, as presented in Table 5.3. Three web 

depths (300, 600 and 900 mm), as well as three flange widths (100, 200 and 300 mm) 

were considered, as illustrated in Figure 5.2c. This way, a wide range of plate girders 

aspect ratios were analysed, ranging from 0.3 up to 3.0. Finally, different steel grades 

were considered (S235, S275, S355 and S460). 

The fourth and last group of plate girders analysed in this parametric study was based 

on the plate girders tested in group III. Herein, the main objective was the assessment of 

the interaction between shear and bending. With this purpose, the thickness of the 

flanges was reduced to allow more girders exhibiting a combined shear plus bending 

failure. The dimensions of the girders are presented in Table 5.4.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

The numerical simulations of the plate girders described above were made using the 

methodology usually designated by GMNIA (geometrically and materially non-linear 

imperfect analysis). Geometric imperfections and residual stresses were taken into 

account at both normal and elevated temperatures, as detailed in section 4.1.3.  

For the simulations at elevated temperatures a uniform temperature distribution in the 

cross-section was used, so that the comparison between the numerical results and the 

EC3 simple design expressions could be possible. The temperatures chosen were 350, 

500, 600 ºC, in order to cover the majority of practical situations. These temperatures 

were applied under steady-state conditions, i.e. the temperature is considered constant 

while the load is increased until failure. 

The number of numerical simulations executed in this parametric study for each group 

of plate girders is presented in Table 5.6. As one can see, 1176 numerical simulations 

were conducted at normal temperature, while 3528 numerical simulations were 

performed at elevated temperatures, amounting to 4704 numerical simulations. Each 

simulation took an average time of 30 minutes on a computer with an Intel® Core™ i5-

3570K 3.4 GHz CPU.

5.2 Methodology for analysis of results 

This thesis focuses on the assessment of the design expressions implemented Part 1-5 of 

EC3 (CEN, 2006b) to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders affected 

by shear buckling. With this purpose, three different zones were considered in the V-M 

interaction diagram for the analysis and comparison of the numerical results with the 

EC3 expressions, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. Hence, plate girders exhibiting a shear 

dominant failure belong to zone 1, while plate girders revealing a bending dominant 

failure belong to zone 3. Finally, plate girders with a combined shear plus bending 

failure belong to zone 2. The ratio of shear force to bending moment for each zone of 

the shear-bending interaction diagram is given in Table 5.7.

Since the precise shape of the shear-bending interaction diagram varies with both shear 

resistance (???,?? and ???,??) and bending resistance (??,?? and ???,??), and since 

these design parameters are different for each plate girder, a single shear-bending 

interaction diagram must be drawn for each plate girder. For evaluating the design rules 

adopted in EC3, a proportional loading is assumed, i.e. the ratio of shear force to 

bending moment remains constant. The numerical results collected from zone 1 are used 

to assess the shear buckling resistance predictions from EC3 given by Eq. (3.1), while 

the numerical results collected from zone 2 are used to evaluate the shear-bending 

interaction design expression (Eq. (3.17)). The ratio by which each numerical data point

exceeded or fell short of its respective shear-bending interaction diagram was 

designated utilisation ratio ? (in Figure 5.4, ? = ???? ?? ???? ??? ). A value of ? larger than 1.0 

means a safe result and the numerical data point is positioned outside the interaction 

diagram. This methodology follows the one established by Saliba et al. (2014). It is 

important having in mind that the length of the zone 2 curve is smaller in the case of 

sections with Class 3 or 4, since the curve should be truncated by the vertical line that 

cuts the horizontal axis in ??,??, as explained in section 3.3. 

Furthermore, in the EC3 design curve for the reduction of the web resistance when 

subjected to shear buckling, ? = 1.0 was used instead of the EC3 recommended value 

? = 1.2, since the applied material model does not take into account the increase of 

20% of the shear yield strength due to strain hardening (Beg et al., 2010). 

5.3 Sequence of analysis of the results 

The analysis of the results obtained in the parametric study follows a logic sequence. As 

a starting point, the values of the distance ?, which defines the position of the plastic 

hinges, obtained by both numerical results from SAFIR and analytical expression from 

EC3 (Eq. (3.12)) were compared in Chapter 6 considering the group I of plate girders. 

Results derived from this comparison demonstrated that the accuracy given by the EC3 

analytical expression to calculate the position of the plastic hinges in steel plate girders 

should be improved. Thus, the application of a ? corrective coefficient to the analytical 

expression to determine the distance ? was proposed.  

Having improved the ability of this design expression, the consequent analytical 

formula to obtain the flange contribution to shear buckling resistance (Eq. (3.11)) has 

been assessed, considering different values for c: the one obtained using the unchanged 

EC3 expression and the one obtained applying the ? coefficient. The accuracy of 

Eq. (3.12) increases significantly when the ? corrective coefficient is applied. 

Afterwards, in Chapter 7 the ultimate shear strength given by the numerical model was 

compared to the one predicted by EC3 through Eq. (3.1). After analysing the ultimate 

shear strength as a whole, the web contribution in the full resistance of a plate girder 

was evaluated. For comparison with EC3 analytical expressions, the contribution from 

the web numerically obtained (??,????? ) is calculated by Eq. (5.1) subtracting the

flange contribution (?? ), obtained using Eq. (3.14), from the ultimate shear strength 

directly predicted by the numerical model. The flange contribution (?? ) to be 

subtracted in Eq. (3.14) is calculated considering ? proposed in Chapter 6.

Chapter 6 Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance 

6.1 General considerations 

The main goal of this Chapter is to evaluate the accuracy of the design expressions to 

predict the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. However, the 

EC3 predictions cannot be directly compared with numerical results, since it is not 

possible to numerically obtain the contribution from the flanges alone. The ultimate 

resistance given by the numerical model is the full resistance including the web 

resistance and the contribution from the flanges.  

Hence, the methodology used to assess the flanges contribution to shear buckling 

resistance was based on the analysis of sets of five girders, maintaining the web 

properties and ranging the thickness of the flanges from 12 to 20 mm (see Figure 6.1). 

Thus, the increase of strength numerically obtained, caused by an increase of 2 mm on 

the flanges thickness, could be compared with the increase of strength given by the EC3 

predictions. It allowed evaluating the accuracy of the EC3 predictions for the flanges 

contribution to shear buckling resistance. 

In this Chapter the plate girders from group I were analysed. The characteristics of this 

group of girders were presented in Chapter 5. For the analysis of the numerical results, 

the procedure presented in Figure 6.2 was followed.

6.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expression to predict the distance between 

plastic hinges 

As one can observe in Eq. (3.11), the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling 

resistance of a steel plate girder depends on the dimensions of the flanges, the steel yield 

strength, the design bending moment considering the effective area of the flanges, the 

largest moment within the panel and the distance ?, which is the distance between 

plastic hinges that forms in flanges (see Figure 6.3).  

According to Johansson et al. (2007), the values of ? given by the EC3 expression 

(Eq. (3.12)) are usually smaller than the values observed in the tests, being justified with 

the fact that in reality there is always an additional support from the web and the plastic 



Chapter 6. Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance 

  89 

mechanism in the flanges cannot develop freely. Therefore, the web and flanges 

contributions to shear buckling resistance cannot be completely separated. Tests 

conducted by Rockey and Skaloud (1969) and Skaloud (1971) showed that the values of 

? varies between 0.16 and 0.75 times the length of the panel (?). Figure 6.4 shows the 

ratio ? ??  for the analysed plate girders. Indeed, the values of ? numerically obtained 

varies between 0.08 and 0.80, limits quite closer to those observed by Rockey and 

Skaloud (1969) and Skaloud (1971), which are represented by the dashed lines in Figure 

6.4. However, this is not observed for the values of ? predicted by the EC3 expression, 

where the ratio ? ??  ranges between 0.26 and 0.33. Hence, with the numerical analysis 

of the distance ?, it is clear the need to improve the accuracy of the expression adopted 

in EC3 for prediction of the distance between plastic hinges.

6.3 Proposal of a corrective coefficient for the EC3 expression to 

predict the distance between plastic hinges 

Figure 6.4 has showed that the value of the distance ? predicted by EC3 through 

Eq. (3.12) is smaller than the one numerically obtained for plate girders with ???? &amp;lt;3. 

Thus, it was demonstrated that Eq. (3.11) adopted in EC3 overestimates the contribution 

from the flanges to shear buckling resistance for ???? &amp;lt;3. Consequently, it is proposed 

an improvement on the expression implemented in EC3 to predict the distance ?. The 

new ?, called by ?????????, is obtained applying a ? corrective coefficient to the original 

expression, as presented in Eq. (6.1). This ? coefficient depends on the web slenderness 

parameter and it is defined by Eq. (6.2) at normal temperature. For simplification, it is 

only proposed the introduction of a ? coefficient, not developing the respective 

expression to determine ?. 

EC3 says nothing about the determination of the distance ? at elevated temperatures and 

it was observed that the values of ? obtained in the numerical analyses at elevated 

temperatures were different of those obtained at normal temperature. Therefore, a 

different ? coefficient, called by ??, was proposed to improve the results given by 

Eq. (3.12) at elevated temperatures. ?? is defined by Eq. (6.3). 

The ratio between the values of ? obtained from both numerical model and EC3 

expression is presented in function of the slenderness parameter of the web in Figure 

6.5a for normal temperature and in Figure 6.5b for elevated temperatures. The bold 

black line represents the proposed coefficient. As one can see, the application of this 

coefficient to the distance ? predicted by EC3 fits better the values of the numerically 

obtained ?. Moreover, ? was considered equal to 1.0 for the plate girders with a web 

slenderness parameter at normal temperature (????) larger than 3.0. At elevated 

temperatures, ?? = 1.0 for ????,? ? 3.5. This was because for those plate girders the 

distance ? predicted by EC3 is generally conservative, i.e. higher than the distance ? 

numerically observed.

plate girders with non-rigid end posts and plate girders with rigid end posts, providing 

safer results for plate girders with web slenderness values lower than 2.5.

Chapter 6. Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance 

  93 

The resistance from the web to shear buckling predicted by EC3 was also compared 

with the one numerically obtained through the Eq. (5.1), as explained previously. The 

web contribution was calculated subtracting the flange contribution to the ultimate shear 

capacity given by the numerical model, considering both the original expression to 

determine the distance ? and the modified expression by the application of the ? 

corrective coefficient.  

So, if the contribution from the flanges given by Eq. (3.11) was correct, all girders of 

each group of five would have different values of ??  but similar values of ??,?????. 

However, big variations on ??,????? were observed when the original EC3 expression to 

determine the distance ? is applied, showing that the EC3 expression to predict the 

contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance is not giving accurate 

results. The results used in the analysis of the web resistance to shear buckling at 

normal temperature are presented in Table 6.1. The average ??,????? for each group of 

five girders with the same web slenderness parameter is listed in Table 6.1, as well as 

the standard deviation and the maximum and minimum values. In order to facilitate the 

analysis, both average and standard deviation are also plotted in Figure 6.7.  

As one can see, the standard deviation obtained using the distance ? given by EC3 is too 

high, mainly for plate girders with web slenderness parameter lower than 2.0. It 

demonstrates that the EC3 expression to predict the flanges contribution was not 

providing consistent results and it needed to be improved. Figure 6.7 shows that the 

introduction of a new ?, called by ?????????, allowed to reduce significantly the 

standard deviation of the results.  

Looking carefully, it is possible to observe that the results from Figure 6.6 are reflected 

in Figure 6.7, i.e. the same tendency on safe and unsafe results is observed when 

analysing the full resistance of the girders (Figure 6.6) or the web resistance only 

(Figure 6.7). It means that the expression to predict the flanges contribution is providing 

more accurate results when the factor ????????? is used. This has significant importance 

since it allows evaluating the EC3 expression to predict resistance from the web to shear 

buckling making sure that the flange contribution is subtracted in the correct 

proportions to the full capacity of the girder provided by the numerical model.

shear strength numerically obtained using SAFIR was compared to the EC3 predictions 

(see Figure 6.8), considering the unchanged ? expression and the ? proposed applying

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

The plate girders were subjected to 350ºC, 500ºC and 600ºC, but since the results are 

quite similar only the results of the plate girders tested at 500ºC are presented here. As 

one can see, there is a clear improvement on the EC3 predictions when the value of ? 

proposed is used. However, there are still some results which are not on the safe side.

Chapter 6. Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance 

  97 

Using the methodology presented in Chapter 5, in the web resistance given by the 

numerical model (??,?????) is compared to the one predicted by the EC3 expressions 

adapted to fire situation by the application of the reduction factors of the steel 

mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. Similar tables to Table 6.1 have been 

built for 350ºC, 500ºC and 600ºC. The results for 500ºC are presented in Figure 6.9.  

As explained before, ??,????? should be the same for all girders with same web 

properties. However, Figure 6.9 shows that the standard deviation of ??,????? is high 

when the distance ? predicted by EC3 is considered, mainly for plate girders with web 

slenderness parameter at elevated temperatures lower than 2.5. It is showed that 

expression should be improved. For that purpose, a corrective coefficient (??) was 

proposed and its consideration causes an improvement on the EC3 predictions for the 

contribution from the flanges to shear buckling resistance. As one can see in Figure 6.9, 

the standard deviation when ?? is considered (green points) is lower when compared to 

the values obtained using the original EC3 expression. It demonstrates that Eq. (3.11) 

gives more accurate predictions when ?? is considered.  

Moreover, it was observed an increase on ??,????? when the proposed distance ? is 

considered. It is because the EC3 predictions overestimate the contribution from the 

flanges to shear buckling (?? ), which influences the web resistance numerically 

obtained using Eq. (5.1). When ?? is applied, the distance ? is higher, so the 

contribution from the flanges predicted by EC3 is lower. Consequently, a lower ??  is 

subtracted in Eq. (5.1) conducting to a higher ??,?????.  

Figure 6.9 also indicates that the EC3 design curve for the web contribution to shear 

buckling is not fitting the numerical results and must be improved. With this in mind, 

new expressions to predict the web resistance to shear buckling at elevated temperatures 

are proposed in Chapter 7 taken into account all the steel plate girders analysed in the 

parametric numerical study.

  99 

6.5 Conclusions 

Based on the work presented in Chapter 6, the following general conclusions are drawn: 

? The expression implemented in EC3 to predict the flanges contribution to shear 

buckling resistance is not providing safe results; 

? A corrective coefficient to improve the accuracy of the expression adopted in 

EC3 to predict the distance between the plastic hinges that forms in the flanges 

is proposed; 

? The EC3 design procedure provides safer and more accurate results when this 

corrective coefficient is considered.

Chapter 7 Shear buckling resistance 

7.1 Failure mechanism 

The resistance of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling is currently based on 

post-critical design methods. Many different models have been developed to illustrate 

the post buckling behaviour and predict the ultimate shear strength of these structural 

elements, as presented in Chapter 2.  

There has been a constant controversy among researchers in an attempt to adequately 

explain the physical post-buckling behaviour of web panels. In fact, the interaction 

between the non-linear shear stress and normal stress that develops from the beginning 

of the shear buckling state until the ultimate strength state is quite complex. The fact 

that more than ten theories have been developed to explain this phenomenon makes 

clear the complexity of the tension field action. This may probably be the largest 

number of failure theories dedicated to a single topic in structural mechanics. 

The Rotated Stress Field Method was implemented in EC3 (CEN, 2006b) for the design 

of plated structural elements subjected to shear buckling and so it has been taken as the 

basis of this thesis. As described before, it assumes a pure shear stress state in the web 

panel preceding buckling and the development of a tension field after buckling. The 

collapse mechanism is characterized by the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges.  

During the analysis of results of the parametric numerical study, the failure mechanism 

assumed by the Rotated Stress Field Method has been frequently observed in the plate 

girders with a shear dominant failure. Consequently, it is described here using, as an 

example, the 2-panel plate girder with the following characteristics: hw=1000 mm; 

tw=4 mm; bf=300 mm; tf=20 mm; ts=20 mm; a/hw=2.0; L=4000 mm; S235.  

Figure 7.1 illustrates the principal stresses distribution developed at the moment of 

collapse for both rigid and non-rigid end posts. The tension field development can be 

clearly seen. Moreover, it is possible to observe that in the plate girder with non-rigid 

end posts this tension field is anchored almost exclusively on the flanges. On the other 

hand, in the plate girder with rigid end posts the anchorage of the tension field is shared 

between the flanges and the end post. Nevertheless, the tension field amplitude is higher 

in the girder with rigid end posts when compared to the girder with non-rigid end posts.

Figure 7.2 shows the mechanism of collapse involving the formation of plastic hinges in 

the flanges. As one can see, the formation of plastic hinges is visible in both plate 

girders irrespective of the type of end supports. However, it is more pronounced in the 

girder with rigid end posts.

Chapter 7. Shear buckling resistance 

  105 

The evolution of the distribution of principal stresses after buckling until the moment of 

collapse is presented in Figure 7.3 for the plate girder with rigid end posts above 

mentioned. As one can see, after buckling the principal tensile stresses start increasing 

symmetrically since the two panels have the same dimensions. At the moment of 

collapse, plastic hinges forms in the flanges while the out-of-plane web buckling 

increases substantially in the panel where the failure mechanism occurs, as may be seen 

in Figure 7.4c.  

The maximum web out-of-plane displacement registered at the beginning of the 

numerical simulation is 3.8 mm, as shown in Figure 7.4a. The initial web out-of-plane 

displacements are due the initial geometric imperfections. Afterwards, the maximum 

web out-of-plane displacement increases progressively up to 16.4 mm in the post-

buckling stage (see Figure 7.4a). Finally, when collapse occurs, the right web panel 

buckle considerably (see Figure 7.4c) with the out-of-plane displacement suddenly 

increases up to 91.5 mm.

Figure 7.4 – Color scale of the out-of-plane web displacements in a steel plate girder tested at 

normal temperature 

The failure mechanism at elevated temperatures of the analysed plate girders affected by 

shear buckling is quite similar to the one observed at 20ºC, involving the development 

of the tension field in the web and the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges. To 

exemplify, it is presented here for the girders analysed above subjected to 500ºC.  

Figure 7.5 demonstrates the tension field development at the moment of collapse for 

both rigid and non-rigid end posts. As it happened at normal temperature, the tension 

field is anchored almost exclusively on the flanges for the girder with non-rigid end 

posts. In the girder with rigid end posts, these rigid end posts contribute to the 

anchorage of the tension field. In this plate girder the tension field covers almost the 

entire web panel. 

Figure 7.6 shows the appearance of plastic hinges in the flanges at the moment of 

collapse in both plate girders. In contrast to what was observed at normal temperature, 

the differences between the girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts on the web buckle 

and on the distance between the plastic hinges in the flanges are not so pronounced.

7.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expressions to predict the web resistance to 

shear buckling 

This section is dedicated to the assessment of the design expressions implemented in 

Part 1-5 of EC3 to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders subjected to 

shear buckling at normal temperature and the adoption of these expressions for fire 

design through the application of the reduction factors of the steel mechanical properties 

at elevated temperatures.  

The comparison of all numerical results with those given by the analytical expressions 

from EC3 is presented in Figure 7.7 for the girders tested at normal temperature and in 

Figure 7.8 for the girders tested at elevated temperatures. The results are divided into 

three different zones in function of the type of failure, as explained in section 5.2.  

Concerning the results obtained at normal temperature, Figure 7.7 demonstrates that 

EC3 is providing safe predictions for almost all the girders belonging to zones 2 and 3. 

However, for the girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure (zone 1), the ultimate shear 

strength predicted by EC3 is not on the safe side for a considerable part of the analysed 

girders, particularly for those with the smaller values of slenderness parameter. On the 

other, for the girders with the higher values of slenderness parameter, the EC3 

predictions are frequently too conservative.  

As regards the girders tested at elevated temperatures, the analytical results are on the 

safe side for almost all of the girders exhibiting a bending dominant failure (zone 3). 

However, the EC3 expressions, adapted to fire design by the application of the 

reduction factors (see section 3.5),  are proving unsafe predictions for a large portion of 

the girders where shear has an important role on the failure (zones 1 and 2).  

It makes clear the need to improve the EC3 expressions, for both normal and fire 

design, in order to provide safe predictions for all steel plate girders irrespective of their 

web slenderness parameter.

As mentioned before, the ultimate shear strength is given by the web resistance to shear 

buckling plus the flanges contribution. Actually, it was previously observed in Chapter 

6 that the expression implemented in EC3 for the flanges contribution to shear buckling 

resistance was not giving accurate results, being proposed a corrective coefficient (?), 

which is detailed in section 6.3 of this document.

Figure 7.9 demonstrates the improvements resulting from the application of this 

coefficient at normal temperature, mainly for the plate girders with web slenderness 

parameter between 1.0 and 2.5. However, for the plate girders with web slenderness 

parameter lower than 1.3, unsafe results are still there. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate 

design expressions for the resistance from the web to shear buckling.  

Figure 7.10 illustrates the comparison between the numerical results and the EC3 design 

curve for all plate girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure (zone 1). It is also possible 

to observe the improvements caused by the application of the corrective coefficient ?. It 

is important to having in mind that, for comparison with EC3 design curve, the 

contribution from the web numerically obtained was calculated by Eq. (5.1) subtracting 

the flange contribution (?? ) from the ultimate shear strength directly predicted by the 

numerical model. Additionally, it is important to note that the EC3 design curve is 

plotted in Figure 7.10 using the values from Table 3.1, depending on the end posts.  

When analysing the effect of the corrective coefficient for the contribution from the 

flanges to shear buckling, Figure 7.10 shows that its application causes an improvement 

on the EC3 predictions, for both rigid and non-rigid end posts. On the one hand, the 

dispersion of results is considerably lower. On the other hand, EC3 predictions are safer 

when this coefficient is applied, since the original EC3 expression overestimates the 

flanges contribution to shear buckling, as it was observed in Chapter 6. 

Regarding the results of the girders with non-rigid end posts, Figure 7.10a shows that 

the EC3 design curve does not fit the numerical results. For the girders with web 

slenderness parameter lower than 1.30, EC3 overestimates the resistance from the web 

to shear buckling. Furthermore, for the girders with high values of web slenderness 

parameter, EC3 underestimates the web resistance. It evidences the need to adjust the 

EC3 design curve and a proposal will be made in the next section of this document.  

Concerning plate girders with rigid end posts, Figure 7.10b demonstrates a better 

agreement between the numerical results and the EC3 design curve. However, it still 

needs to be improved for girders with low values of web slenderness parameter. 

Modifications to the current EC3 design curve will also be proposed.

Figure 7.10 – Web contribution to shear buckling at normal temperature 

A similar analysis to the one performed at normal temperature was conducted for the 

plate girders subjected to elevated temperatures. As it has been made for normal 

temperature, a corrective coefficient (??) was proposed to improve the accuracy of the 

EC3 expression used to predict the contribution from the flanges to shear buckling. 

Figure 7.11 shows the improvements obtained just by the application of ?? to the 

expression to determine the distance ? on the calculation of the contribution from the 

flanges to shear buckling resistance. However, it is visible that the application of ?? is 

not enough because there are still a lot of unsafe results. Consequently, it is important to 

evaluate the accuracy of the EC3 expressions used to determine the web resistance to 

shear buckling. 

The shear buckling resistance of the web predicted by EC3 is compared with the 

numerical resistance in Figure 7.12. Figure 7.12a presents this comparison for the 

girders with non-rigid end posts. As one can see, despite the improvements given by the 

introduction of ??, the EC3 design curve should be improved for fire design, mainly for 

the girders with web slenderness parameter lower than 2.7. The same behaviour may be 

observed for the girders with rigid end posts. Figure 7.12b shows that the lowest the 

web slenderness parameter in fire situation is, the highest the unsafe portion of the 

numerical results is.

Hence, it is evident that the EC3 design curves, used to predict the web resistance to 

shear buckling of steel plate girders with rigid and non-rigid end posts, should be 

improved for fire design. Modifications to these curves are proposed in the next section 

of this thesis.

Figure 7.12 – Web contribution to shear buckling at elevated temperatures 

 

In order to understand the variation of the EC3 predictions with different parameters, 

such as the web slenderness (hw/tw), the aspect ratio (a/hw) and the ratio between the 

flanges and web thicknesses (tf/tw), the results of the plate girders belonging to group II 

were carefully analysed looking for patterns on the EC3 predictions. 

Regarding the web slenderness, it was observed that, generally, the lowest the web 

slenderness is, the higher the unsafe nature of the EC3 predictions is. As an example, 

the results of the girders with hw=1000 mm are presented in Figure 7.13 and Figure 

7.14, for 20ºC and 500ºC, respectively. In the charts below, “NREP” means non-rigid 

end posts, while “REP” means rigid end posts. Trend lines were used for SAFIR results 

in order to facilitate the comparison with EC3 results. 

With respect to the nature of the EC3 predictions in terms of the aspect ratio of the 

girders, it was observed that the most unsafe predictions are clearly those for girders 

with a/hw=0.5, at both normal and elevated temperatures.  

Figure 7.15 demonstrates that the safe nature of the EC3 predictions at 20ºC varies with 

the ratio tf/tw. The highest the ratio tf/tw is, the highest the safe nature of EC3 predictions 

is. At elevated temperatures it is even more evident, as shown in Figure 7.16.

Chapter 7. Shear buckling resistance 

  119 

The statistical analysis performed in section 7.4 will allow evaluating the influence of 

these parameters with more detail, but taking into account the modifications to the EC3 

design procedure presented over in this thesis, which may lead to conclusions somewhat 

different of those presented here. For instance, with the current EC3 design expressions 

the most unsafe predictions correspond to the girders with the lowest aspect ratios. 

However, if the reduction factor for the web resistance to shear buckling proposed in 

next section is considered, these girders will have the most safe predictions. 

7.3 Proposal of new design expressions 

On the basis of the numerical investigation presented and discussed in Chapter 6 and 

Chapter 7 of this document, a proposal of new expressions to predict the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plated structural elements is presented. This proposal follows the EC3 

principles, using all design rules presented in Chapter 3, only modifying two steps on 

the calculation of the shear resistance of a steel plate girder subjected to shear buckling.  

One concerns to the application of the corrective coefficient, already presented in 

section 6.3, on the determination of the distance c needed for the calculation of the 

contribution from the flanges to shear buckling resistance. The other modification on 

the EC3 procedure consists in using a different reduction factor for the web contribution 

to shear buckling resistance. Instead of the reduction factor presented in Table 3.1, the 

reduction factor presented in Table 7.1 should be used for the design at 20ºC, while the 

reduction factor given by Table 7.2 should be used for fire design. It is important to note 

that considering these proposals, the shear buckling resistance must be checked only 

when the following conditions are satisfied (instead of those presented in section 3.2):

These new design curves listed above are represented by the red lines in the charts 

below. The design curve at normal temperature for the girders with non-rigid end posts 

is presented in Figure 7.17a, while the design curve for girders with rigid end posts is 

presented in Figure 7.17b. It is visible that the proposed curves fit much better the 

numerical results. For the girders with non-rigid end posts, the design curve was 

readjusted for both the girders with ???? &amp;lt;1.32 where the EC3 design curve was 

overestimating the web resistance and the girders with ???? ? 1.32 where the EC3 design 

curve was underestimating the web resistance. Regarding the girders with rigid end 

posts, the new proposal only modifies the overestimated EC3 predictions (???? &amp;lt;1.32).  

Concerning the proposed design curves for elevated temperatures, they are plotted in 

Figure 7.18. The range of unsafe results was quite large and the main goal of these new 

curves was to stop the overestimations given by the EC3, even though that there are 

some cases where the EC3 predictions will be very conservative, since the dispersion of 

results is larger at elevated temperatures when compared to normal temperature. 

The improvements obtained by the proposed design curves for the determination of the 

ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders are presented in Figure 7.19 and Figure 

7.20, for normal and elevated temperatures, respectively. These Figures may be 

compared with Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.8, where the proposals were not considered. As 

it can be seen, the EC3 procedure is providing safe predictions for almost all the 

analysed girders when these proposals are considered. The exceptions are the girders 

with very small web slenderness that are not very common in practice. Nevertheless, the 

unsafe differences are small and acceptable.

7.4 Statistical analysis 

The utilisation ratio (U) is used to compare the numerical results with the analytical 

results given by the EC3 expressions. A statistical analysis of the utilisation ratio values 

is presented here in order to understand the accuracy of the EC3 expressions and the 

improvements introduced by the application of the proposals presented before. 

Table 7.3 presents such analysis for the results obtained at normal temperature. Results 

from different zones of the shear-bending interaction diagram (see Figure 5.4) are 

separately evaluated. Zone 1 comprises the results from the girders with a shear 

dominant failure, which are used to assess the expressions to predict the shear buckling 

resistance. Zone 2 contains the results from the girders with a combined shear plus 

bending failure, which are used to evaluate the expression for the interaction between 

shear and bending. Finally, the results from the girders with a bending dominant failure 

are included in zone 3. Furthermore, two design approaches were considered in the 

statistical analysis. One, called EC3 in the tables below, where the numerical results are 

compared with the analytical results provided by the unchanged EC3 expressions, and 

other (called EC3+P) where the results given by SAFIR are compared with the EC3 

expressions modified by the proposals presented in this thesis. A similar analysis is 

presented in Table 7.4 for the results obtained at elevated temperatures.

Chapter 7. Shear buckling resistance 

  125 

A quick analysis allows concluding that the application of the proposals presented in 

this thesis induces significant improvements on the EC3 predictions at both normal and 

elevated temperatures. The application of ? to the expression to determine the distance 

between plastic hinges that forms in the flanges improves the EC3 predictions for the 

flanges contribution to shear buckling (???,??), which are reflected in the zone 1 results. 

On the other hand, the application of the new reduction factors for the web contribution 

to shear buckling (??) improves the EC3 predictions for the web resistance (???,??), 

which affects the results from the zones 1 and 2. Finally, the improvements in zone 3 

results are due to a different zone classification of the utilisation ratios when the 

proposed ???,?? is used, since the boundaries of each zone are obtained using ???,?? 

(see Table 5.7). When analysing Table 7.4, a decrease on the number of girders with a 

bending dominant failure from 413 to 95 may be observed when the proposals are taken 

into account. It causes an increase on the percentage of safe results since some girders 

were classified as failing by bending and actually they fail before, due to the interaction 

between shear and bending, not reaching the resistance moment of the cross-section. 

Hence, considering the zones classification where the proposals are taken into account, 

at normal temperature the failure was caused by shear in 78.3% of the analysed plate 

girders (zone 1), while a combined shear plus bending failure was observed in 19.8% 

(zone 2) and a bending dominant failure only happened in 1.9 % (zone 3). As regards 

the girders analysed at elevated temperatures, a shear dominant failure (zone 1) was 

observed in 2701 girders (76.6%), a combined shear plus bending failure (zone 2) was 

registered in 732 (20.7%) and, finally, the failure of 95 (2.7%) of the analysed girders 

was caused by bending (zone 3). In comparison with the results obtained at normal 

temperature, a slight decrease on the shear dominant failures was observed, while the 

number of failures caused by bending or by the interaction between shear and bending 

has grown.  

Concerning the results at normal temperature, Table 7.3 shows that both design 

approaches provide, on average, safe results since the average utilisation ratio is higher 

than 1.0. On the other hand, for the design approach considering the unchanged EC3 

expressions, a larger deviation from the average is evident when compared to the design 

approach where the proposals presented in this document are taken into account. The 

results given by the unchanged EC3 procedure do not satisfy two of the three validation

criteria presented by CEN TC 250 (1999). Indeed, for the zone 1 plate girders, the 

ultimate shear strength predicted by EC3 is not on the safe side for almost 25% of the 

analysed girders, of which about 14% with an utilisation ratio lower than 0.95. This 

percentage of 25% of results on the unsafe side is larger than the maximum of 20 % 

recommended by CEN TC 250 (1999). Furthermore, CEN TC 250 (1999) also refers 

that the calculation result shall not be on the unsafe side by more than 15%. This is not 

satisfied by the EC3 procedure, since the maximum unsafe result is 0.79 (21%). When 

the proposals are considered, it is observed a substantial decrease on the standard 

deviation from 0.15 to 0.07, as well as a reduction on the percentage of unsafe results to 

3.8%, of which only 0.2% with differences larger than 5%. Moreover, the maximum 

unsafe deviation decreased from 21% to 6%, while the maximum safe deviation also 

decreased from 51% to 35%.  

As it was observed for the plate girders with a shear dominant failure analysed at 

normal temperature, the EC3 design expressions are providing safe predictions for the 

plate girders affected by the interaction between shear and bending (zone 2). However, 

when the proposals are considered, a smaller deviation from the average is observed, no 

longer exist unsafe results and the maximum safe deviation is smaller. 

Regarding fire design, despite the average utilisation ratio is on the safe side, the EC3 

predictions are unsafe for almost 46% of the girders with a shear dominant failure and 

31.0% of the girders with a combined failure. It is important to note that a large part of 

unsafe results are beyond the 5% margin. With the application of the proposals 

presented in this thesis, the percentage of unsafe results was reduced to 2.7% for the 

zone 1 girders. From those 2.7%, only 0.3% are differences larger than 5%. 

Furthermore, the maximum unsafe deviation fell significantly from 31% to 10%. 

Concerning the zone 2 plate girders, the percentage of unsafe results was substantially 

reduced to 1.1%, with no unsafe differences larger than 5%. 

Histograms of relative frequency were made for the results of each zone of the shear-

bending interaction diagram, considering the two design approaches above mentioned at 

normal and elevated temperatures. Moreover, working with data from Table 7.3 and 

Table 7.4, it is possible to fit the results onto the normal distributions. The histograms 

and the normal distributions are presented in Figure 7.21 to Figure 7.23 for normal 

temperature and in Figure 7.24 to Figure 7.26 for elevated temperatures.

The results from Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 are clearly reflected on the histograms 

presented above. The larger standard deviation often observed when the proposals are 

not taken into account is coherent with the histograms presented in Figure 7.21 to 

Figure 7.26. 

With respect to the normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, it is the 

most important and most widely used distribution in statistics. Considering an arbitrary 

safety margin of 5%, the probability of safety predicted for the EC3 design procedures 

is always smaller when the proposals are not taken into account. As an example, 

looking for the results of the girders collapsing due to shear buckling, which are the 

focus of this thesis, a 85.5% probability of safety is forecast for the EC3 procedures at 

normal temperature against the 98.6% of its counterpart. Regarding fire design, a 69.8% 

probability of safety is predicted for the EC3 procedures adapted to elevated 

temperatures against the 96.2% of its counterpart. Not only is the modified procedure 

predicted to be safer overall, but the results are much closer to the average value (lower 

standard deviation), which certifies the proposals as a strong improvement over the EC3 

design procedures.  

A more detailed statistical analysis was also performed to understand the accuracy of 

the EC3 design procedure in function of different parameters, such as: normalized web 

slenderness parameter, aspect ratio, web slenderness, ratio between flanges and web 

thicknesses, steel grade and temperature. This detailed statistical analysis is presented in 

Table 7.5 for the zone 1 plate girders analysed at normal temperature. Table 7.6 shows 

the results for the zone 1 plate girders subjected to elevated temperatures. The data 

presented in these tables was obtained considering the proposals presented in this thesis. 

It is discussed below, together with some charts for an easier understanding of the 

achieved conclusions. 

A similar procedure was accomplished for the zone 2 plate girders, i.e. the plate girders 

exhibiting a combined shear plus bending failure. The results are presented in Chapter 

8, the chapter dedicated to the analysis of the interaction between shear and bending.

? Normalized web slenderness 

As mentioned before, the detailed statistical analysis allows evaluating the accuracy of 

the EC3 procedure, taken into account the proposals presented in this document, in 

function of different parameters. 

Regarding the EC3 normalized web slenderness, it was observed in Table 7.5 that the 

highest the web slenderness parameter is, the more conservative the EC3 predictions 

are. The same trend was observed for girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts at both 

normal and elevated temperatures. As an example, Figure 7.27 shows the variation of 

the average utilisation ratio for six slenderness parameter ranges of the girders with non-

rigid end posts analysed at normal temperature. The standard deviation is represented by 

the red bars and the maximum and minimum values are illustrated by the grey lines.

with non-rigid end posts analysed at normal temperature 

? Aspect ratio 

The statistical analysis in terms of the aspect ratio showed that the lowest the aspect 

ratio is, the more conservative the EC3 procedure is. It may be clearly observed in 

Figure 7.28, where are plotted, for the group II of plate girders, the web contribution to 

shear buckling in terms of the girders aspect ratio. The charts on the left represent the 

girders analysed at normal temperature, while the charts on the right are related to the

with non-rigid end posts are presented in the top two charts, while the results of the 

girders with rigid end posts are placed below. The orange and yellow points represent 

the girders with larger aspect ratios, while the green and blue points correspond to the 

girders with lower aspect ratios. As one can see, the orange and yellow points are closer 

to the design curve, therefore the average nearest 1.0 and the lower standard deviation. 

On the other hand, the green and blue points are more distant from the design curve and 

so the higher value for the average utilisation ratio. 

Figure 7.28 also indicates that there is a great dispersion of results on the girders with 

rigid end posts, when compared with the girders with non-rigid end posts. Furthermore, 

it is observed that such dispersion is larger at elevated temperatures. This observation is 

fully supported by the difference on the values of standard deviation presented in Table 

7.5 and Table 7.6. As regards the girders with rigid end posts, the standard deviation at 

normal temperature is 0.08 for the girders with a/hw ? 1 and 0.07 for the girders with 

1 &amp;lt;a/hw ? 2. However, at elevated temperatures these values are 0.14 and 0.08, 

respectively. It represents a substantial increase on the girders with a/hw ? 1, while only 

a slight increase as observed for the girders with 1 &amp;lt;a/hw ? 2.

? Web slenderness 

The statistical results demonstrated that the highest the web slenderness is, the more 

conservative the EC3 predictions are, at both normal and elevated temperatures. The 

same trend was observed for rigid and non-rigid end posts. In order to exemplify, the 

results for the girders with rigid end posts are presented in Figure 7.29. In addition, a 

large deviation from the average is evident at elevated temperatures. Finally, it is 

perceptible that the majority of the unsafe results come from the girders with 

hw/tw ? 100, mainly at elevated temperatures (see Table 7.6).

? Ratio between flanges and web thicknesses 

When analysing the data from Table 7.5 and Table 7.6, it was concluded that the ratio 

tf/tw is not a key factor on the accuracy of the EC3 predictions for the girders with non-

rigid end posts at both normal and elevated temperatures. However, for the girders with 

rigid end posts that is not really true. In Figure 7.28 it was detected a bigger dispersion 

of results on the girders with rigid end posts, mainly at elevated temperatures. Now, it is 

possible to observe that there is a correlation between the ratio tf/tw and such dispersion, 

which occurs mainly for the girders with tf/tw &gt; 3. Although there, this increase on the 

results dispersion is not so evident at normal temperature. But, at elevated temperatures, 

it can be easily seen in Figure 7.30. 

In defence of the EC3 design procedure, it worth mentioning that the ratio tf/tw &gt; 3 is not 

so common in practice. The ratio tf/tw &gt; 3 results from the choice of testing girders with 

quite strong flanges in order to have in most of the cases a failure mode due to shear 

buckling. However, in practice, the flanges are designed to support the bending 

moments and the ratio tf/tw is not high often. Furthermore, it is important to have in 

mind that the EC3 design procedure is on the safe side, being more conservative for this 

king of plate girders.

? Steel grade 

The influence of the steel grade on the accuracy of the EC3 predictions is evaluated 

here. Four steel grades were analysed in this thesis. As it can be seen in Figure 7.31, the 

conservative nature of the EC3 predictions at normal temperature slightly increases with 

the increase of the steel grade. Regarding EC3 predictions at elevated temperatures, this 

behaviour is more evident. Furthermore, it is possible to note that the EC3 predictions 

are more conservative for the girders with rigid end posts, when compared with the 

girders with non-rigid end posts.

? Uniform elevated temperature 

Finally, the last parameter analysed on the detailed statistical analysis was the uniform 

elevated temperature that was imposed to the girders. The results presented in Table 7.6 

are illustrated in Figure 7.32, which demonstrates that, for the analysed elevated 

temperatures, there is no correlation between the accuracy of the EC3 design procedure 

and the temperature range.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

7.5 Conclusions 

Based on the work presented in Chapter 7, the following general conclusions are drawn: 

? The EC3 design procedure to determine the web resistance to shear buckling at 

normal temperature is providing unsafe results for plate girders with normalized 

web slenderness lower than 1.3; 

? Small modifications to the reduction factor for the web shear buckling resistance 

are proposed in order to improve the safety and precision of the EC3 predictions; 

? For the fire design of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling, the 

application of the reduction factors for the stress-strain relationship of steel at 

elevated temperatures to the EC3 design procedure is not enough, since there are 

still too many unsafe predictions; 

? Consequently, a new reduction factor for the web resistance to shear buckling in 

fire situation is proposed, providing safe results when incorporated in the EC3 

design procedure.

Chapter 8 Shear-bending interaction 

8.1 Failure modes 

The interaction between shear and bending in steel plate girders subjected to shear 

buckling is analysed in this Chapter. Three different failure modes were observed in the 

parametric numerical study: a shear dominant failure characterized by the web shear 

buckling, a bending dominant failure recognized by the local buckling of the 

compression flange and, finally, a combined shear plus bending failure involving and 

interaction of the failure modes mentioned above. 

Figure 8.1 shows three different failure modes observed for the same 2-panel plate 

girder in function of its aspect ratio. The plate girder presented in Figure 8.1 has rigid 

end posts and it was subjected to 500ºC. The designation “PG 1000x10+300x20_S235“ 

means: PG – plate girder; 1000 – web depth (mm); 10 – web thickness (mm); 300 – 

flanges width (mm); 20 – flanges thickness (mm); S235 – steel grade.  

The typical deformed shape of the girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure may be 

observed in Figure 8.1a, where it is visible the web shear buckling and no buckling in 

the flanges. The shear dominant failure changes to a bending dominant failure when the 

girder length is increased from 2 m to 6 m (and consequently the aspect ratio from 1.0 

to 3.0). The failure mechanism is presented in Figure 8.1c. Finally, a combined shear 

plus bending failure is obtained for an intermediate span (4 m), as shown in Figure 8.1b. 

Different failure modes may also be observed for a plate girder with fixed length, as 

shown in Figure 8.2. This is obtained increasing the number of transverse stiffeners. 

The reduction of the distance between transverse stiffeners increases the ultimate shear 

strength of plate girders making them less susceptible to the occurrence of shear 

buckling. 

As mentioned in Chapter 5, a single shear-bending interaction diagram must be drawn 

for each plate girder, since it depends on shear resistance (???,?? and ???,??) and 

bending resistance (??,??  and ???,??). Figure 8.2 demonstrates that the plate girders 

classification into different zones of the shear-bending interaction diagram, performed 

as presented in Chapter 5, can be confirmed by the obtained deformed shape at failure.

The design expression implemented in Part 1-5 of EC3 for the shear-bending interaction 

(Eq. (3.17)) is evaluated in this section. Only the girders with a combined shear plus 

bending failure (zone 2) are used to assess the accuracy of this expression. The 

improvements achieved by the application of the proposals presented in this thesis are 

presented in Figure 8.3.

As mentioned in section 7.4, it is important to note that the zones classification of the 

girders may change when the proposals are considered, since it depends on ???,??. For 

example, that is why in Figure 8.3b the “EC3” points with slenderness values higher 

than 4.0 do not have their equivalents in the “EC3 + proposals” points. Those girders 

were classified as zone 2 but with the application of the proposals are now classified as 

zone 1. It happens mainly for the points placed in the boundaries of each zone of the 

shear-bending interaction diagram.

At normal temperature, Figure 8.3a demonstrates that the obtained improvements are 

mainly related to the girders with ???? ? 1.0. The statistical analysis presented in Table 

7.3 indicates that EC3 design expression is providing good results, with only 9.2% of 

unsafe results. A 97.8% probability of safety is predicted for the EC3 design expression, 

if an arbitrary safety margin of 5% is considered, as it can be seen in Figure 7.22. 

However, the proposals presented in this thesis to improve the EC3 predictions for the 

web resistance to shear buckling (???,??) also improved the results of the shear-bending 

interaction expression, since ???,?? is incorporated in this expression. The dispersion of 

results was reduced (lower standard deviation, lower maximum safe deviation) and the 

probability of safety predicted for the EC3 design procedure is now 100%. 

As concerns elevated temperatures, the improvements given by the proposals were more 

significant, as shown in Figure 8.3b. The percentage of unsafe results decreased from 

30.9% to 1.1% and the standard deviation was also reduced (see Table 7.4). The 

probability of safety predicted for the EC3 interaction expression applied to fire design 

rose from 81.5% to 99.6%, as it can be seen in Figure 7.25. 

Furthermore, it is perceptible that the highest the web slenderness parameter is, the 

lowest is the tendency for the girders have a combined shear plus bending failure 

mechanism. At normal temperature, it is visible that the majority of the girders with a 

combined shear plus bending failure has ???? comprised between 0.7 and 2.2. Regarding 

the girders subjected to elevated temperatures, a failure caused by the interaction 

between shear and bending is registered mainly for girders with 0.8 ? ????,? ? 2.7.  

8.3 Statistical analysis 

A detailed statistical analysis, similar to the one performed for the plate girders with a 

shear dominant failure (zone 1), was performed for the zone 2 plate girders (combined 

shear plus bending failure). Table 8.1 shows the results for the girders tested at normal 

temperature, while the results for the girders subjected to elevated temperatures are 

listed in Table 8.2. The data from both tables is discussed below. As mentioned for the 

zone 1 girders, the results for the zone 2 girders were also obtained considering the EC3 

design procedures modified by the proposals previously presented.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

From the data presented above, it is noticeable that the probability of occurrence of a 

combined shear plus bending failure is quite small for the plate girders with the 

following characteristics: ???? &gt; 3, ?? ??? &gt; 300 or ?? ??? &gt; 3. The girders with high 

web slenderness (???? &gt; 3, ?? ??? &gt; 300) are extremely susceptible to the occurrence of 

shear buckling, while the girders with high stiffness flanges (?? ??? &gt; 3) have a 

considerable bending resistance being likely to collapse due to shear.  

Concerning the web slenderness, the higher it is, the more conservative the EC3 

predictions are at both normal and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the dispersion of 

results increases with the increase of the web slenderness, as can be verified in the 

values of standard deviation listed in the tables presented above.  

Regarding the aspect ratio, it is observed the opposite. The lowest the aspect ratio is, the 

more conservative the EC3 design procedure is and the highest the dispersion of results 

is, for both normal and elevated temperatures. With respect to the influence of the ratio 

between the flanges and web thicknesses, Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 demonstrate that the 

expression for the interaction between shear and bending suits better the girders with 

?? ???  between 2 and 3. 

As regards the steel grade, it is perceptible at both normal and elevated temperatures 

that the increase of the steel yield strength is reflected by an increase on the 

conservative degree of the EC3 predictions. Moreover, an higher standard deviation is 

also observed for the girders with higher steel grade. 

Finally, when evaluating the influence of the elevated temperature range it was 

concluded that, as it happened for the zone 1 plate girders, there is no correlation 

between the accuracy of the EC3 design expression and the temperature range.  

8.4 Conclusions 

Based on the work presented in Chapter 8, the following general conclusions are drawn: 

? The EC3 expression for the V-M interaction provides reasonable results at normal 

temperature. Nevertheless, a small improvement can be observed when the 

proposals from previous chapters are taken into account; 

? In fire situation the results given by this EC3 expression are not satisfactory, being 

recommended to always have the proposals into account.

Chapter 9 Influence of different parameters on the ultimate 

shear strength of steel plate girders 

9.1 Shear strength in function of cross-section properties 

In today’s world, civil engineers face the big challenge of providing safe, cost-effective 

and environmentally healthy structures. With this thesis it is intended to help engineers 

on the development of rules which will help designing safe and cost-effective steel plate 

girders subjected to shear buckling. The safety of the expressions adopted in current 

European Standards for the design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling was 

evaluated throughout Chapters 6 to 8. 

In this section, the strength enhancement caused by the increase of cross-section 

properties of steel plate girders was evaluated, such as: web thickness, web depth, 

flange thickness and steel yield strength, using the numerical results presented before. 

The main goal of this analysis is to help designers providing cost-effective steel plate 

girders. Lately, the influence of the end supports (rigid or non-rigid end posts) on the 

ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling is also evaluated. 

These evaluations are based on the results given by the numerical model. 

9.1.1. Normal temperature 

The increase of strength provided by the increase of the web thickness was evaluated 

using the plate girders belonging to group II whose dimensions and geometric 

configuration are presented in Table 5.2 and Figure 5.1, respectively. The strength 

enhancement provided by the increase of the web depth was assessed considering the 

same group of girders. The increase of strength given by the increase of the flange 

thickness was evaluated using the group I of plate girders, whose geometric properties 

are listed in Table 5.1. Finally, it was calculated the increase of strength provided by the 

increase of the steel yield strength taking into account the plate girders with distance 

between transverse stiffeners equal to 900 mm belonging to group III, whose 

dimensions and geometric configuration are presented in Figure 5.3 and Table 5.3, 

respectively. 

The strength enhancement given by the increase of 1 mm on the web thickness is 

presented in Figure 9.1 for plate girders with non-rigid end posts and different aspect

156 

ratios. Figure 9.2 illustrates the results for the plate girders with rigid end posts. As one 

can see, the highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, for both 

plate girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts. For example, the increase of the web 

thickness from 4 to 5 mm in a plate girder with non-rigid end posts, hw=1200 mm and 

a/hw=0.5 provides a strength enhancement of 34%. On the other hand, the same girder 

with a/hw=3.0 provides a strength enhancement of 44%. 

It is important to note that some percentages are lower than expected because the failure 

mode of the girders changes. In some cases, increasing 1 mm on the web thickness 

causes the change of the girder failure mode. It happens for the girders with a/hw=1.5 

and tw=10 mm, a/hw=2.0 and tw=9 and 10 mm, and a/hw=3.0 and tw=7, 8, 9 and 10 mm. 

Furthermore, the percentage of the increase on the ultimate resistance is generally 

higher than the increased percentage of steel area. The girders where the failure mode 

changes with the increase of the web thickness are the exception. For instance, 

increasing the web thickness from 4 to 5 mm means to increase the area of steel in 25%. 

But this increase of steel area equal to 25% caused an increase on the ultimate bearing 

capacity from 31% (a/hw=0.5) up to 44% (a/hw=3.0). Other example is when the web 

thickness is increased from 7 to 8 mm, which means increasing the steel area in 

approximately 14%. In this case, the increase on the ultimate resistance ranged between 

16% and 22%, always higher than 14%. 

It is also possible to observe that, for the analysed plate girders, the strength 

enhancement caused by the increase of the web thickness does not vary much with the 

dimension of the web depth, since the increase of steel area is the same irrespective of 

the web depth. In some cases, it slightly increases with the increase of the web depth. 

For example, the increase of the web thickness from 7 to 8 mm, in a plate girder with 

non-rigid end posts and a/hw=1.0, provides a strength enhancement of 20% for the 

girder with hw=800 mm and 21% for the girder with hw=1600 mm. 

Finally, comparing Figure 9.1 with Figure 9.2, it is noticeable that the increase on the 

web thickness is more effective on the plate girders with non-rigid end posts, i.e. for the 

same increase on the web thickness, the percentage of the strength enhancement is 

larger on the girders with non-rigid end posts, when compared with the girders with 

rigid end posts. Those differences vary from 1% for the girders with high aspect ratios 

(a/hw=3.0) to 9% for the girders with low aspect ratios (a/hw=0.5).

Chapter 9. Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders 

   159 

Figure 9.3 shows the strength enhancement caused by the increase of the web depth. 

The plate girders with tw=5 mm are used as an example since the observed behaviour is 

the same irrespective of the web thickness. Unlike what happened with the increase of 

the web thickness, the highest the aspect ratio is, the lowest the strength enhancement is. 

Again in contrast to previously noted when analysing the strength enhancement caused 

by the increase of the web thickness, the increase of the web depth is more effective on 

the girders with rigid end posts, when compared with girders with non-rigid end posts. 

In the girders with non-rigid end posts the strength enhancement ranges from 3% up to 

11%. On the other hand, the increase of strength varies between 4% and 14% in the 

girders with rigid end posts. 

Moreover, the percentage of increased steel is always higher than the percentage of 

strength enhancement. For instance, the increase of steel area caused by the increase of 

the web depth from 800 to 1000 mm is 25% but the maximum strength enhancement 

was 14%. When the web depth is increased from 1400 to 1600 mm (steel area increases 

14%), the maximum strength enhancement is only 7%. It makes clear that increasing the 

web depth is not the best solution when it is needed to increase the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plate girders. Assuming the cost as directly proportional to the quantity 

of steel, increasing the web depth should be only considered when there is a need to 

increase the resistance bending moment.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

160 

The influence of increasing the flanges thickness on the ultimate resistance of steel plate 

girders subjected to shear buckling was also evaluated. With that purpose the girders 

belonging to group I were analysed, as mentioned before. As an example, Figure 9.4 

shows the increase of strength caused by increments of 2 mm on the flanges thickness 

for the plate girders with hw=1000 mm, since the results are identical irrespective of the 

web depth. As one can see, the increase of the flanges thickness does not cause a 

significant strength enhancement, ranging from 0.7 up to 3.1 %. It is visible a tendency 

showing that the highest the aspect ratio is, the lower the strength enhancement is.

b) 

Figure 9.4 – Increase of strength at 20ºC given by the increase of the flanges thickness for the 

girders with hw=1000 mm 

The increase of strength caused by the increase of the steel yield strength was also 

evaluated using the 2-panel plate girders from group III (a=900 mm) in order to analyse 

only girders with a shear dominant failure. Four different steel grades were considered, 

as presented in Table 5.5. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 9.5 and 

Figure 9.6 for girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts, respectively. 

It is possible to observe that the influence of the web slenderness (hw/tw) on the strength 

enhancement is not significant. Furthermore, it is perceptible that the strength 

enhancement slightly decreases for a/hw=3.0. Finally, comparing Figure 9.5 with Figure 

9.6 it is visible that the strength enhancement is slightly higher for the girders with rigid 

end posts.

Chapter 9. Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders 

   161 

Increasing the steel grade from S235 to S275 corresponds to an increase of 17% on the 

steel yield strength, while increasing the steel grade from S275 to S355 and S355 to 

S460 corresponds to an increase of the steel yield strength around 29%. As expected, 

due the buckling phenomena, these values are not reflected on the increase of the 

ultimate resistance, which is somewhat lower. According to the obtained results, 

generally the increase on the ultimate resistance is about 71% of the percentage increase 

in steel yield strength for girders with non-rigid end posts and 75% for girders with rigid 

end posts. For instance, for the girders with non-rigid end posts, the average increase on 

the ultimate resistance is 12% when the steel yield strength increases from S235 to S275 

and 21% for the other consecutive steel grades. Regarding the girders with rigid end 

posts, the increase on the ultimate resistance is slightly higher: 13% and 23%.

Figure 9.6 – Increase of strength at 20ºC given by the increase of the steel yield strength for the 

girders with rigid end posts 

After the analysis of the influence of different cross-section properties (web thickness, 

web depth, flanges thickness and steel yield strength) on the ultimate shear strength of 

steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling at normal temperature, it seems clear that 

the most cost-effective solution to improve the ultimate shear strength of a steel plate 

girder with a shear dominant failure is to increase the web thickness. 

9.1.2. Elevated temperatures 

An analogous analysis to the one conducted at 20ºC was performed for 350ºC, 500ºC 

and 600ºC. The results are quite similar, so only the results of the plate girders tested at 

500ºC are presented here. Moreover, the fundamental conclusions obtained for elevated 

temperatures are equal to those obtained for normal temperature. For that reason, they 

are more briefly described.

Chapter 9. Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders 

   163 

The impact of the web thickness increase is illustrated in Figure 9.7 for the girders with 

hw=1200 mm, since as it was at normal temperature the results are not significantly 

influenced by the size of the web depth. Figure 9.7 demonstrates that the highest the 

aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, for both plate girders with non-

rigid and rigid end posts. Comparing with 20ºC, the strength enhancement is usually 2% 

lower at elevated temperatures.  

Furthermore, it is visible that the web thickness increase is more effective on the plate 

girders with non-rigid end posts. It is also important to note that the percentage of 

strength enhancement is higher than the increased percentage of steel area, with 

exception of the girders not exhibiting a shear dominant failure. It makes clear that 

increasing the web thickness is the best solution in order to increase the resistance of 

steel plate girders affected by shear buckling. 

The strength enhancement caused by the increase of the web depth is presented in 

Figure 9.8. Analysing the girders with non-rigid end posts, it is observed that the lowest 

the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, in contrast to what occurred 

at normal temperature. For the girders with low aspect ratio, the strength enhancement 

was in some cases 5% lower than recorded at 20ºC.  

Regarding the girders with rigid end posts, it was observed the same pattern obtained at 

normal temperature: the lowest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement 

is. The strength enhancement was generally 1% lower. Moreover, as it happened for 

normal temperature, the percentage of strength enhancement is always lower than the 

percentage of increased steel area. 

Figure 9.9 shows the strength enhancement provided by the increase of the flanges 

thickness. It was observed an increase on the ultimate resistance up to 2%, when 

compared to the results obtained at normal temperature. At elevated temperatures, the 

strength enhancement caused by the increase of the flanges thickness ranges between 1 

and 5%, which is still considered a non-significant strength enhancement. Furthermore, 

it is perceptible that the highest the aspect ratio is, the lower the strength enhancement 

is.

Figure 9.9 – Increase of strength at 500ºC given by the increase of the flanges thickness for the 

girders with hw=1000 mm 

The strength enhancement obtained with the increase of the steel yield strength was also 

evaluated at elevated temperatures. The results for the girders with non-rigid end posts 

are presented in Figure 9.10, while Figure 9.11 shows the results for the girders with 

rigid end posts.  

As it was observed at normal temperature, the web slenderness (hw/tw) has no significant 

influence on the strength enhancement. Additionally, it is noticeable that the strength 

enhancement decreases about 1% for the girders with aspect ratio equal to 3.0. Finally, 

it is perceptible when comparing Figure 9.10 with Figure 9.11 that the strength 

enhancement is slightly higher for the girders with rigid end posts. 

Furthermore, it was observed that increasing the steel yield strength causes greater 

resistance benefits at elevated temperatures. At normal temperature, the increase on the 

ultimate resistance in the girders with non-rigid end posts was about 71% of the 

percentage increase in steel yield strength. But, in fire situation it is around 85%. This 

value increases to 88% for the girders with rigid end posts. 

After the analysis of the results at elevated temperatures, it can be said that the most 

cost-effective solution to improve the ultimate resistance of a steel plate girder affected 

by shear buckling is to increase the web thickness, as it was at normal temperature.

9.2 Reduction of strength caused by the elevated temperatures 

The reduction of strength caused by the elevated temperatures is analysed in this 

section. With that purpose, the numerical results of the plate girders belonging to group 

II were considered. In order to analyse only girders with a failure caused by shear 

buckling, only the girders with web thickness equal to 4 mm were taken into account. 

It was observed that the reduction of resistance, caused by the elevated temperatures, 

increases with the increase of the web depth dimension, for the girders with a/hw=0.5, 

ranging between 11% and 20%. For the remaining girders, with higher aspect ratios, the 

variation of the percentage of strength reduction with the increase of the web depth is 

quite small. In order to analyse the influence of the aspect ratio on the reduction of 

resistance caused by the elevated temperatures, it was decided to present here (see 

Figure 9.12) only the girders with hw=1000 mm, since the conclusions are the same 

irrespective of the web depth. Figure 9.12 demonstrates that the highest the aspect ratio 

is, the highest the strength reduction caused by the elevated temperatures is.  

Furthermore, the strength reduction on the girders with non-rigid end posts is higher 

when compared with the girders with rigid end posts. The lower the aspect ratio is, the 

higher this difference is. It means that the girders with rigid end post are more capable 

to anchor the different stresses distribution imposed by the elevated temperatures that 

occur during a fire. For the girders with non-rigid end posts, the average values of the 

strength reduction according to the applied uniform elevated temperatures of 350ºC, 

500ºC and 600ºC are 21%, 39% and 64%, respectively. Regarding the girders with rigid 

end posts, these values decrease to 14%, 33% and 60%.

9.3 End posts 

Normally, steel plate girders are provided with end posts. Girders with rigid end posts 

involve higher costs resulting from the additional plates, but also from the welding. 

Hence, when designing, it is very important to know when the rigid end posts are more 

effective and the extra costs are reflected in a considerable additional resistance. With 

that purpose, an analysis about their influence was performed. The increase of strength 

given by the rigid end posts is evaluated, as well as the influence of its configuration, 

i.e. the distance between the transverse stiffeners which form the rigid end post and the 

thickness of the transverse stiffener which is not supporting the reaction force. 

9.3.1 Increase of strength given by the rigid end posts 

Firstly, the increase of strength given by the condition of rigid end post is evaluated. 

The numerical results from the group II of plate girders, where five different aspect 

ratios (a/hw) were considered, are used to perform this analysis. Figure 9.13 illustrates 

the differences on the resistance from the web to shear buckling given by the application 

of a rigid end post instead of a non-rigid end post. On the left are placed the results at 

normal temperature and on the right it is possible to find the results obtained for the 

girders subjected to 500ºC. Only one elevated temperature is presented here, since the 

results are quite similar for the three analysed temperatures.

Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire

Figure 9.13 demonstrates that the condition of rigid end post is as effective as the lower 

aspect ratio is, at both 20ºC and 500ºC. It can be clearly observed in the charts from 

Figure 9.13, where the increase in the web resistance is significant for low aspect ratios 

(0.5 and 1.0), decreasing to girders with intermediate aspect ratios (1.5 and 2.0), to 

finally be almost nill for girders with a/hw = 3.0. It is directly related to the fact that the 

lower the aspect ratio is, the more the condition of rigid end post influences the whole 

behaviour of the web panel, since the percentage of the perimeter constrained gets 

higher. Furthermore, it is perceptible that the highest the web slenderness parameter is, 

the highest the increase of strength given by the rigid end post is.  

Figure 9.14 shows the average strength enhancement, between the plate girders with 

rigid and non-rigid end posts, in function of the plate girders aspect ratio (a/hw). As one 

can see, it is clear that the lower the aspect ratio is, the more effective the rigid end post 

is. At normal temperature, the average strength enhancement of the group II of plate 

girders was 9.2% for the girders with a/hw=0.5, decreasing for girders with intermediate 

aspect ratios, being almost negligible (0.6%) for girders with a/hw=3.0. 

Moreover, Figure 9.14 also reveals that the rigid end post is more effective at elevated 

temperatures than at normal temperature. At elevated temperatures, the strength 

enhancement is higher but the tendency observed at normal temperature remains the 

same, with the average values ranging from 1.7% (a/hw=3.0) up to 20.3% (a/hw=0.5).  

The influence of other geometrical ratios was also analysed, as illustrated in Figure 

9.15. The strength enhancement provided by the rigid end post is represented in Figure 

9.15a in function of the web slenderness and in Figure 9.15b in terms of the ratio 

between the flanges and web thicknesses. It is visible that the higher these ratios are, the 

higher the increase of strength is, at both normal and elevated temperatures. On the 

other hand, it is also possible to notice that the maximum strength enhancement is 

26.5% at normal temperature and 46.5% in fire situation, which is a significant 

difference. 

Thus, it was concluded that the steel plate girders where the application of rigid end 

posts, instead of non-rigid end posts, is more profitable are those with the following 

characteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw and high tf/tw.

9.3.2 Influence of the configuration of the rigid end post 

An end post is considered as rigid if it satisfies the requirements presented in section 

3.4.1.1 of this document. The condition of rigid end post depends on the distance 

between the transverse stiffeners which forms the end post and on the area of the 

transverse stiffeners. Thus, a rigid end post may have different configurations. In this 

section it is intended to evaluate the influence of the rigid end post configuration on the 

ultimate shear strength of the plate girder.  

With that purpose, the numerical model presented in Chapter 4 was used, considering a 

2-panel plate girder with hw =1000 mm, bf = 300 mm and tf = 20 mm. Three different 

web thicknesses were considered (4, 5 and 6 mm). The intermediate transverse stiffener 

(placed at mid-span on the position of application of forces) has 20 mm thickness, as 

well as the internal transverse stiffeners of the rigid end posts which carry the reaction 

forces of the supports (stiffener “Au” in Figure 3.14). 

The influence on the ultimate shear strength of the rigid end post configuration was 

evaluated in two ways. Firstly, influence of the distance between the transverse 

stiffeners which form the rigid end post (distance “e” in Figure 3.14) was evaluated, 

considering three different values: 100 mm, 200 mm (the value considered in the 

numerical analyses presented before) and 300 mm, as shown in Figure 9.16. 

Afterwards, the thickness of the external transverse stiffeners of the rigid end posts 

(stiffener “Ae” in Figure 3.14 and the blue stiffener in Figure 9.16) was ranged from 5 

up to 20 mm, by increments of 5 mm, in order to assess its influence on the ultimate 

shear capacity of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling.  

   

a) e = 100 mm b) e = 200 mm c) e = 300 mm 

Figure 9.16 – Rigid end post configurations analysed in this section (example for a/hw=1.0) 



Chapter 9. Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders 

   173 

The girders were tested at normal temperature and subjected to a uniform elevated 

temperature of 500ºC, which results in a total of 234 additional numerical tests. The 

geometric imperfections and the residual stresses were taken into account. The results 

obtained for the girders analysed at normal temperature are listed in Table 9.1, while the 

results of the girders subjected to 500ºC are presented in Table 9.2. The ultimate shear 

capacity numerically obtained is called “Vnr” and “Vr” for the girders with non-rigid and 

rigid end posts, respectively. The columns “Dif.” correspond to the increase of strength 

provided by the different configurations of the rigid end post when compared to the 

resistance of the girders with non-rigid end posts. 

Regarding the influence at 20ºC of the distance “e” between the transverse stiffeners 

which form the rigid end post, usually the highest it is, the lowest the increase of 

strength is, as illustrated in Figure 9.17a. However, at 500ºC the opposite may be 

observed for the girders with a/hw=1.0 and 2.0 (see Figure 9.17b). Figure 9.17 also 

shows that the condition of rigid end post is more effective in fire situation. Moreover, 

the increase of strength at elevated temperature comparatively to normal temperature is 

so much higher as the greater the distance “e” is. For example, the increase of strength 

of the girder with a/hw=1.0, hw/tw=200 and e=100 mm is 9.4% at 20ºC and 17.0% at 

500ºC (7.6% higher), and for the girder with a/hw=1.0, hw/tw=200 and e=200 mm the 

correspondent values are 8.2% at 20ºC and 24.5% at 500ºC (16.3% higher). On the 

other hand, it is also perceptible that the higher the web slenderness (hw/tw) is, the more 

evident the increase in the ultimate shear strength given by the rigid end post is, at both 

normal and elevated temperatures. It is also observed that, as mentioned before, the 

lowest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, due to the increase of 

the percentage of the perimeter constrained. 

Concerning the thickness of the external transverse stiffener of the rigid end post, 

Figure 9.18 demonstrates its influence on the increase of strength given by the rigid end 

post is not quite significant. By another words, providing a girder with non-rigid end 

posts with two additional transverse stiffeners changing the end configuration to rigid 

end posts may cause a substantial impact on the ultimate shear strength (the maximum 

increase observed was almost 15% and 30% at 20ºC and 500ºC, respectively). However, 

increasing the thickness of these transverse stiffeners does not cause a considerable 

impact on the ultimate shear strength. The maximum observed was 4% at normal 

temperature and 8% at elevated temperature.

The EC3 design procedure for girders with rigid end posts does not depend on the 

configuration of the rigid end posts. It only refers that the requirements presented in 

section 3.4.1.1 of this document should be satisfied. However, it is important to note 

that the variation of the configuration of the rigid end posts (distance “e” between 

transverse stiffeners and thickness of the external transverse stiffener) may change the 

safety nature of the EC3 predictions, as shown in Table 9.3. Although its influence is 

not so significant for girders with high aspect ratios, the configuration of the rigid end 

post may be relevant for the safety nature of the EC3 predictions of the girders with low 

aspect ratios. Thus, the implementation of some design rules in EC3 which had into 

account the stiffness of the rigid end posts should be considered, mainly for girders with 

low aspect ratios, where the influence of the rigid end posts is more significant.

9.4 Conclusions 

The main objective of this section was to provide information to better understand the 

behaviour of plate girders subjected to shear, which can for instance help designers 

executing an optimum design. Based on the work presented in Chapter 9, the following 

general conclusions are drawn: 

? The most cost-effective solution to improve the ultimate bearing capacity of steel 

plate girders under shear loading is to increase the web thickness; 

? The reduction of resistance in case of fire is higher in the girders with non-rigid end 

posts, when compared to the girders with rigid end posts; 

? The highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength loss caused by the elevated 

temperatures is;

? The application of rigid end posts is more profitable in girders with the 

following characteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw and high tf/tw; 

? The influence of the configuration of the rigid end posts is not significant in plate 

girders with high aspect ratios. However, it may be important for the safety nature 

of the EC3 predictions of the girders with low aspect ratios.

10.1 Conclusions 

The lack of guidance for the fire design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling 

has been the main motivation for this research work. In this section, the main findings 

and conclusions achieved during the research are presented. 

The first stage of this research has been a literature review in order to better understand 

the behaviour of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling. Having finalised this 

stage, it has been important to analyse the design recommendations implemented in the 

European Standards in order to know where they would be improved. Then, bearing in 

mind that the absence of fire design guidelines needed to be corrected, a plan 

comprising different tasks has been stablished. 

The first was to develop a solid numerical model able to accurately reproduce the 

behaviour of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling at both normal and elevated 

temperatures, which would be the basis of the parametric study involving around 5000 

numerical simulations conducted for evaluating the accuracy of the design procedure 

implemented in EC3 to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders affected 

by shear buckling. Then, this numerical model was duly validated against experimental 

tests at both normal and elevated temperatures. It was shown that the numerical model 

developed in the FEM software SAFIR provides a good approximation to the actual 

behaviour of steel plate girders and it is able to accurately predict the ultimate shear 

strength of steel plate girders under shear, as well as their failure modes. 

A numerical study about the influence of the geometric imperfections and residual 

stresses on the ultimate resistance of steel plate girders at normal temperature and in 

case of fire was also performed. It was observed that do not have into account the 

geometric imperfections conducts to unrealistic shear buckling resistances. At 20ºC, the 

higher the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is, the more conservative 

the results are. However, at elevated temperatures the maximum amplitude of the 

geometric imperfections has no significant influence on the ultimate capacity of the 

analysed plate girders. Furthermore, the consideration of the maximum amplitude 

recommended in EC3 is too severe for the numerical modelling of experimental tests, 

being tw/10 an appropriate value to use for that purpose. Regarding the residual stresses,

184 

their influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders is high at normal 

temperature. However, they have no significant influence in fire situation. 

Afterwards, based on the results of the parametric numerical study, the EC3 design 

procedure at normal temperature and its use for fire design by the application of the 

reduction factors from Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b) were evaluated. It has been 

demonstrated that the EC3 expression for the prediction of the flanges contribution to 

shear buckling resistance was not providing accurate results at both normal and elevated 

temperatures. A corrective coefficient to improve the accuracy of the expression to 

determine the position of the plastic hinges in the flanges, and consequently improve the 

precision of the EC3 predictions for the contribution from the flanges to shear buckling 

resistance, has been proposed. 

The next task of the plan initially created was to evaluate the EC3 design procedure to 

determine the resistance from the web to shear buckling. For that purpose, the 

contribution from the flanges previously improved was subtracted from the full 

resistance of the girder given by the numerical model, since it could not give the web 

resistance alone. Small modifications to the EC3 design procedure at normal 

temperature have been proposed in order to provide safer and more accurate predictions. 

Furthermore, new expressions for the calculation of the web resistance to shear buckling 

in fire situation have also been proposed. 

To finish the assessment of the accuracy of the EC3 design expressions, the expression 

for the interaction between shear and bending was also evaluated. It has been observed 

that the EC3 expression provides satisfactory results at normal temperature. 

Nevertheless, a slight improvement may be observed when the proposals are taken into 

account. Regarding fire design, the results given by this EC3 expression are not 

satisfactory (around 1/3 of unsafe results), being recommended to always have the 

proposals into account. 

In the last stage, a study about the influence of different parameters on the ultimate 

shear strength of steel plate girders has been performed in order to help the designer to 

provide cost-effective plate girders. The strength enhancement caused by the increase of 

the cross-section properties (web thickness, web depth, flange thickness and steel yield 

strength) of a steel girder was evaluated. It was observed that the most cost-effective 



Chapter 10. Final considerations 

185 

solution to improve the ultimate resistance of a steel plate girder affected by shear 

buckling is to increase the web thickness.  

The reduction of strength caused by the elevated temperatures was also evaluated. It has 

been demonstrated that the highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength reduction 

caused by the elevated temperatures is. Furthermore, it has been observed that this 

strength reduction is more significant on the girders with non-rigid end posts, when 

compared to the girders with rigid end posts.  

Afterwards, an analysis about the influence of the end posts has been carried out. 

Firstly, the increase of strength given by the condition of rigid end post has been 

evaluated, being concluded that the steel plate girders where the application of rigid end 

posts is more profitable are those with the following characteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw 

and high tf/tw. 

Finally, the influence of the configuration of the rigid end post has been analysed. It was 

concluded that its influence is not substantial for plate girders with high aspect ratios. 

However, the configuration of the rigid end post may be relevant for the safety nature of 

the EC3 predictions of the girders with low aspect ratios. 

10.2 Future developments 

During the development of this research work, different important issues related to the 

occurrence of shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire are discussed and 

some new design expressions are proposed. The main effort was done in order to fulfill 

the lack of guidance on the European Standards about this topic. However, further 

investigation is still needed. This final section describes possible future research areas. 

? Fire resistance experimental tests 

The results of this thesis were based in numerical simulations, through the use of the 

finite element methods. Although the numerical model was duly validated against some 

of the few experimental tests found in the literature, numerical simulations do not 

always reproduce perfectly the real behaviour of the structures.  

Due to the limited size of furnaces and the high cost of the fire resistance experimental 

tests, there are in the literature only few experimental tests of steel plate girders under 

shear loading at elevated temperatures. It would be important performing more fire 



Shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire 

 

186 

resistance experimental tests, since they could reduce the distance between the real 

behaviour of the structures and test conditions, when compared with numerical 

simulations. 

? Fire resistance experimental tests on stainless steel plate girders 

The absence of fire resistance experimental tests is even more serious in stainless steel 

plate girders. During the development of this thesis it was possible to develop a 

numerical model for stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling (Reis, et al., 

2016b). This numerical model was satisfactorily validated with experimental tests at 

normal temperature. However, no fire resistance experimental tests in stainless steel 

plate girders under shear loading were found on the literature. As there is no guidance 

on the European Standards for the design of stainless steel plate girders affected by 

shear buckling, it would be of significant importance performing fire resistance 

experimental tests in order to validate the numerical model, that posteriorly would be 

the basis of a parametric numerical study whose results are necessary for the evaluation 

of the application of the design expressions at normal temperature from Part 1-4 of EC3 

(CEN, 2006a) to fire design. 

? Stainless steel 

Although more expensive than the carbon steel, stainless steel plate girders may be 

competitive due to their smaller need of thermal protection against fire, adding this 

advantage to others such as the durability, low maintenance, aesthetic appearance and 

corrosion resistance. 

However, as mentioned in previous point, there is no guidance in EC3 for the fire 

design of stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling at elevated 

temperatures. Thus, a research work similar to the one performed in this thesis should 

be performed for stainless steel plate girders, in order to cover the lack of fire design 

rules in EC3.  

? Plate girders with longitudinal stiffeners 

The design expressions proposed in this thesis for the safety evaluation of shear 

buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire were based on transversally stiffened plate 

girders. Despite the application of longitudinal stiffeners is not so common as the use of 



Chapter 10. Final considerations 

187 

transverse stiffeners, further analysis is required in this specific topic in order to extend 

the conclusions achieved for the evaluated cased to a general case of longitudinal 

stiffening. 

? Different loading types and steel grades 

The numerical model developed in this thesis considers the loading by the application of 

a concentrated force at mid-span. Other loading types should be considered, as for 

example the application of uniformly distributed loading over all span of the girder. 

Furthermore, only steel grades until 460 MPa were taken into account in this thesis. 

High strength steel grades should also be considered in the future. 

? Non-uniform temperatures 

Non-uniform temperatures may impose additional forces on the thin webs of steel plate 

girders and even chance the failure mode. Thus, it would be important to study their 

influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders. 

However, it is important do not forget the difficulty of implementing in the European 

Standards a simple calculation method that includes non-uniform temperatures.
