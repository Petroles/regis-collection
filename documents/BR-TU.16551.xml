a amar a natureza recordo com orgulho. 

 

«Não resisti. Regressei à minha velha casa, e ali, sob a sombra 

do tamarindo, me deixei afogar em lembranças. […] 

O tamarindo mais sua sombra: aquilo era feito para abraçar 

saudades. Minha infância fazia ninho nessa árvore. Em minhas 

tardes de menino, eu subia ao último ramo como se em ombro de 

gigante e ficava cego para assuntos terrenos. Contemplava era o 

que no céu se cultiva: plantação de nuvem, rabisco de pássaro. E 

via os flamingos, setas rapidando-se furtivas pelos céus. Meu pai 

sentava em baixo, na curva das raízes, e apontava os pássaros:  

-Olha, lá vai mais outro! 

O flamingo parecia retardar sua passagem.»

Resumo 

 

A sedimentação excessiva constituiu actualmente um dos maiores 

problemas para a integridade ecológica dos cursos de água. No entanto, ainda 

pouco se sabe sobre os efeitos deste problema no biota e processos chave 

para o funcionamento dos ecossistemas ribeirinhos, como a decomposição da 

folhada. Neste trabalho pretendemos avaliar o efeito dos sedimentos finos (&amp;lt;2 

mm) no processamento de folhas de carvalho por fungos (Hifomicetes 

Aquáticos) e invertebrados. Para isso foi avaliado em laboratório o efeito da 

velocidade de transporte e granulometria de sedimentos (&amp;lt;0,063 mm e &amp;lt;2 

mm) na perda de massa da folhada e parâmetros microbianos associados. 

Verificou-se que as duas velocidades de deslocação de sedimentos simuladas 

(60 e 120 rpm) não afectaram a perda de massa, a dureza da folha ou a taxa 

de esporulação fúngica, independentemente da presença ou não de 

sedimentos. Sedimentos de granulometria mista &amp;lt;2 mm estimulam as taxas de 

decomposição da folhada por abrasão, enquanto que sedimentos de diâmetro 

&amp;lt;0,063 mm parecem induzir hipóxia no substrato inibindo o crescimento da 

biomassa fúngica e a decomposição; neste caso, ocorre um maior investimento 

na reprodução. O efeito dos sedimentos depositados (&amp;lt;2 mm), e o efeito dos 

sedimentos em suspensão (&amp;lt;0,063 mm) na performance dos invertebrados 

foram avaliados através de testes de consumo com o insecto triturador 

Sericostoma vittatum. Os resultados indicam que a deposição dos sedimentos 

limitam o consumo foliar uma vez que os invertebrados não são capazes de 

encontrar alimento enterrado a profundidades ? 1,5 cm; sedimentos &amp;lt;0,063 

mm em suspensão (105 &amp;lt;TDS &amp;lt;110) não afectam as suas taxas de consumo.

Os testes realizados sugerem que os efeitos dos sedimentos dependem da sua 

deposição ou suspensão, granulometria e heterogeneidade, afectando de 

forma específica decompositores e detritívoros e, portanto, a reciclagem de 

nutrientes e fluxo de energia do ecossistema ribeirinho.

Abstract 

 

Nowadays, the increased sedimentation due to anthropogenic activities 

is one of the biggest threats to the ecological integrity of watercourses. 

However, there are few studies about the impact of sediments on biota and on 

key processes for stream functioning, such as leaf decomposition. In this work 

we aimed to evaluate the effect of fine sediments (&amp;lt;2 mm) on the breakdown 

process of oak leaves by fungi (Aquatic Hyphomycetes) and invertebrates. 

Therefore, the effect of transport velocity and sediment granulometry (&amp;lt;2 mm 

and &amp;lt;0.063 mm) on the loss of leaf mass and microbial parameters associated 

were assessed. The two transport velocities chosen (60 and 120 rpm) did not 

affect mass loss, leaf toughness or sporulation rate, regardless the presence or 

absence of sediments. Real mixture sediments (&amp;lt;2 mm) stimulate breakdown 

rates due to physical abrasion. On the other and, sediments smaller than 0.063 

mm seem to induce hypoxia conditions, inhibiting fungi biomass and 

decomposition; in this case fungi invest more on reproduction while reducing its 

biomass. The effect of deposited sediments (&amp;lt;2 mm) and the effect of 

sediments in suspension (&amp;lt;0.063 mm) in the performance of invertebrates 

were assessed through leaf consumption tests by the shredder Sericostoma 

vittatum. The results show that sediments may limit the consumption of leaves 

since the shredders are not able to feed on leaves buried at ? 1.5 cm; 

sediments &amp;lt;0.063 mm on the water column (105 &amp;lt;TDS &amp;lt;110) does not affect 

consumption rates. The experiments done suggest that the effect of sediments 

may depend on their deposition or suspension, granulometry and

heterogeneity, affecting decomposers and detritivores in a specific way, and 

therefore, nutrients recycling and energy flux of the stream ecosystem.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

Freshwater systems are essential natural resources for life (Vörösmarty 

et al., 2010). Despite constituting only about 0.01% of the world’s water these 

systems directly support 6% of all described species (Malmqvist &amp;amp; Rundle, 

2002). Freshwaters are among the most endangered ecosystems, being 

threatened by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, industrialization, 

water pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat and 

invasion by exotic species (Dudgeon et al., 2005). Furthermore, water 

resources are not evenly distributed, being barely accessible in some areas 

(Dewson et al., 2007). 

Running waters are linked to and dependent on the surrounding 

catchment areas, establishing strong and specific relationships with the 

adjacent terrestrial areas (Hynes, 1975). Streams in particular are being 

affected by the interaction of multiple factors including land use modification 

(Meyer &amp;amp; Wallace, 2001), deforestation (Naymik &amp;amp; Pan, 2005), and variations in 

the stream geomorphology and hydrology. In fact, recent data indicate that 

human activities may increase the rates of sedimentation of up to 10 times the 

natural inputs (Leigh &amp;amp; Webb, 2006). 

 

1.1. Low order streams 

Headwater streams, located at the beginning of the river continuum 

(Vannote et al., 1980) may constitute up to 85% of the total length of fluvial 

network (Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007). Headwaters are low order streams (1-3 order; 

Vannote et al., 1980), usually shaded by riparian vegetation with a low 



! 3!

autotrophic production. Even though primary producers (e.g. algae) can be 

found attached to submerged surfaces (periphyton) like stones and wood 

stocks in areas where light conditions are appropriate, this autochthonous 

source of organic matter does not play a fundamental role in the energy flow of 

shaded headwaters (Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007). 

In temperate low order streams, the energy source is strongly dependent 

on the deciduous riparian vegetation - allochthonous inputs of organic matter - 

mainly composed by leaf litter (Molinero &amp;amp; Pozo, 2004) but also by floral 

fragments, bark, wood and fruits (Benfield, 1997). This material may vary in 

quality and quantity, depending on the composition of the riparian vegetation, 

and is usually supplied to the stream with a marked seasonality. The higher 

litter input occurs during autumn/winter (Abelho &amp;amp; Graca, 1996), and this leaf 

material is the main support of the aquatic food webs based on detritus for the 

following months until next fall (Sponseller &amp;amp; Benfield, 2001). Thus, some 

invertebrates have synchronized their life cycles with the litter inputs (Vannote 

et al., 1980; Cummins et al., 1989). 

The conversion of these leaves into living biomass, i.e., leaves 

processing, is largely promoted by the activities of decomposers (mainly fungi - 

Aquatic Hyphomycetes - and bacteria) and detritivores (mainly shredders; 

Gessner et al., 1999). Detritus decomposition constitutes a key-ecosystem level 

process in these ecosystems (Ferreira et al., 2013). This process is primarily 

determined by the chemical and physical characteristics of the leaves (Abelho, 

2001) and is modulated by environmental factors (Young et al., 2008). For 

example, soft nutritious leaves as alder are known to decompose faster than 

the tough oak leaves rich in lignin, cellulose and phenolic compounds (Cortez et 



! 4!

al., 1996). It is also generally accepted that in warmer or nutrient enriched 

waters leaves decompose faster (Webster &amp;amp; Benfield, 1986; Menéndez et al., 

2003); on the other hand, low pH usually means a slower breakdown (Young et 

al., 2008; Riipinen et al., 2009). Other factors such as the stream hydrological 

regime, water velocity (Dewson et al., 2007) and type of sediment of the stream 

(Chauvet, 1997), may also influence leaves degradation (Young et al., 2008). 

 

1.2. Leaf litter breakdown in streams 

Leaf decomposition starts upon leaves immersion and usually follows 

three main steps: leaching, conditioning and fragmentation. These steps may 

overlap, although a more or less defined sequence is usually observed 

(Gessner et al., 1999). 

Leaching is a fast abiotic process that usually lasts for 48 h. During this 

process, soluble organic and inorganic compounds are released from leaves to 

the water (Abelho, 2001; Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007), and up to 42% of leaf weigh 

may be lost (reviewed by Abelho, 2001). The quality and quantity of the 

leachates are determined a priori by chemical and structural differences of the 

leaf species (Campbell et al., 1992) and can be influenced by several abiotic 

factors such as pH, water temperature and turbulence (Abelho, 2001). 

Conditioning is mainly performed by fungi (namely Aquatic 

Hyphomycetes) and also by bacteria. This prokaryotic group is usually more 

important in advanced stages of leaves decomposition. Aquatic hyphomycetes 

are usually dominant in the first phase of the colonization process and are the 

main responsibles for the increase in palatability and nutritional value of detritus 



! 5!

to invertebrates (Gessner, 1999); this change in the detritus characteristics is 

known as conditioning. 

Changes in leaves nutritional value include increases in Nitrogen and 

Phosphorous, softening, degradation of recalcitrant Carbon and enrichment 

with fungal enzymes (Canhoto &amp;amp; Graça, 2008). Fungal spores settlement 

(Kearns &amp;amp; Bärlocher, 2008), fungal biomass and sporulation also depend on 

leaves physic-chemical characteristics and is also modulated by environmental 

factors such as flow and water chemistry (Abelho, 2001). The flow allows 

greater turbulence and oxygenation of water, better for fungi colonization 

(Chauvet, 1992). According to Ferreira et al. (2006), the current velocity is able 

to control the fungal parameters, stimulating the spore release and the conidial 

production, being the presence of fungal species higher. 

The last phase of decomposition is usually designated as fragmentation. 

It can be promoted by physical abrasion and/or invertebrates, during their 

feeding or “architectural” activities to build their cases (Abelho, 2001). 

Invertebrates activities are known to accelerate the fragmentation process 

(Graça et al., 2001). There are many studies that indicate invertebrates as 

active subjects on fragmentation (Gessner &amp;amp; Chauvet, 1997; Abelho, 2001; 

Ferreira &amp;amp; Graça, 2006). 

Shredders usually make a great contribution to the Fine Particulate 

Organic Matter (FPOM) content in streams (Covich et al., 1999) by breaking 

leaves into smaller fragments, increasing in that way the area available for 

microbial activity and providing extra food for collectors downstream; 60% of the 

ingested material is converted into faeces (Cummins et al., 1989). Shredders, 

important ecological engineers in the stream (Moore, 2006), are fundamental 



! 6!

for the lotic system as they process fluxes of matter downstream, playing an 

important role on the river continuum concept (Vannote et al., 1980). Shredders 

prefer to feed on leaves colonized (Graça, 2001), since fungi change chemically 

and physically the quality of leaves (Canhoto &amp;amp; Graça, 2008), and might also 

prefer particular fungi (Lecerf et al., 2005) or even different combination of 

leaf/fungi species, which may provide specific and/or distinct and fundamental 

nutrients and carbohydrates to the consumers (Barlocher et al., 2003). On the 

other hand, fungi can also have preference for different leaves (Canhoto &amp;amp; 

Graça, 2008). 

 

It is generally recognized that leaves physical abrasion promotes 

fragmentation (Chauvet et al., 1993); however, the relative importance of this 

promoter of abiotic degradation is still unknown (Heard et al., 1999). 

Leaves physical fragmentation on streams is ruled by leaves 

characteristics and is dependent on environmental factors such as current 

velocity, substratum and quantity and quality of the sediment in transport 

(Chauvet et al., 1993). The loss of leaves integrity is facilitated by the 

conditioning process and is usually slower when leaves are in pools rather than 

in riffle areas (Casas, 1996). As stated by several authors (Benfield et al., 2001; 

Lepori et al., 2005) higher flows, especially during floods, increase the amount 

of suspended sediments, and consequently the physical abrasion of leaves. 

However, the opposition was also found: Matthaei et al. (2010) found an 

increase in decay rate at reduced stream flows, which can be explained by the 

retention of sediments resulting from flow reduction. In fact, when leaves are 



! 7!

submitted to coarse sediment, a higher breakdown rate is usually observed, 

when comparing to fine sediment (Young et al., 2008). 

 

1.3. Sediments and sedimentation 

1.3.1. Types of sediments 

Sediments can be characterized according to their shape, size, 

mineralogy, colour, and orientation (Gordon et al., 2004). The type of sediments 

usually depends on the origin of the input: hill slopes, abrasion and/or sorting 

(Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007), and their deposition will be influenced by their shape, 

size, density and fall velocity (Bethwell &amp;amp; Mutz, 2005). Nevertheless, the 

impacts of sediments on ecosystem will depend on the characteristics of the 

stream (e.g. topography and soil type), surrounding areas, and the volume of 

sediments transported (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997). 

Sediment loads can be determined by the amount of sediments 

transported in a point during a specific time interval, multiplied by the water 

discharge (Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007). The expression “fine sediment” usually 

defines elements smaller than 2 mm, including clay, silt and sand (Wood &amp;amp; 

Armitage, 1997). However, not all authors use the same designation, some 

considering particles smaller than 250 µm to be fine sediment (Kreutzweiser et 

al., 2005). 

According to Gordon et al. (2004), there are three major groups of 

sediment loads: flotation load, dissolved load (particles carried in the solution) 

and sediment load. This last group is divided into two categories: washload, (&amp;lt;

0.063 mm), and bed-material load that can be suspended load or bedload. 



! 8!

Division in these categories is difficult though, because they change 

substantially depending on water flow (Fig. 1). 

 

Figure 1 – Representation of the different sediment loads of the 

stream according to Gordon et al. (2004). 

 

The transport of sediments is a natural feature of streams. Transportation 

and distance are directly related with the flow, since higher flows transport 

sediments further. Usually, all sediments derive from erosion of the basin slope, 

but urban streams have a different sediments supply, since it depends on urban 

infrastructure, usually presenting bed erosion, with different consequences 

(Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007). Fine sediments can be transported either by rolling, 

sliding or salting (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997), or on the water column when flow is 

sufficient (Petts et al., 1985; Fig. 2).

Petts et al., 1985. 

 

1.3.2. Excessive sedimentation in watercourses: a worldwide problem 

Sediments are a natural component of streams. However, the amount of 

sediments produced and transported are presently excessive due to human 

activities (Schofield et al., 2004), and sedimentation is threatening the aquatic 

fauna (Richter et al., 1997). The concept of sedimentation includes “the process 

whereby substrata are covered and interstitial spaces of the substrata are filled 

by deposited sediment” (Henley et al., 2000). This process may change the 

substrate through changes in superficial surface (Graham, 1990) and depends 

on the flow (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997). Usually, sedimentation is higher when 

the flow is low, since it allows the suspended sediments to settle (Wood &amp;amp; 

Armitage, 1997). However, according to Bond (2004), sedimentation can be 

lower when the flow is reduced, since the quantity of suspended sediments 

transported also decreases. 



! 10!

Excessive sedimentation is a worldwide problem frequently associated 

with anthropogenic activities. Such activities include excavation of river sand, 

forest clearance (Broekhuizen et al., 2001; Larsen &amp;amp; Ormerod, 2010), 

modification of riparian vegetation and changes within the drainage basin such 

as agricultural activites (Townsend et al., 2008; Larsen &amp;amp; Ormerod, 2010), 

industrialization (Broekhuizen et al., 2001), construction of road structures 

(Extence, 1978), and/or mining (Broekhuizen et al., 2001). All these activities 

are known to change the dynamic of sediment transportation and settlement 

(Waters, 1995). 

Sedimentation is presently considered one of the main threats to the 

ecological integrity of streams and rivers (Young et al., 2008; Benoy et al., 

2012) with important consequences on the fluvial continuum. On one hand, big 

amounts of sediment transported can lead to problems in the estuarine areas 

and reefs, whereas a lack of sediment transported downstream can lead to a 

retreat in river deltas and coastal shorelines, causing losses of habitat and 

increasing vulnerability to storms (Allan &amp;amp; Castillo, 2007). On the other hand, 

overload sedimentation in potable waters requires filtration treatment, which can 

be avoided by reforesting some species (Lake et al., 2000). 

 

1.3.3. Consequences of sedimentation for the biota 

Sediments can be either carried by the flow, increasing turbidity, or 

deposited on the bottom of the stream. An excess of sediments can affect the 

biota (Larsen &amp;amp; Ormerod, 2010). 

Primary producers are affected by sedimentation (Quinn et al., 1992), 

with macrophyte leaves and stems directly affected by scouring and abrasion 



! 11!

(Lewis, 1973). Thus, primary production can be reduced, especially in situations 

where light available is low (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997), producing a bottom-up 

effect in food webs. The diversity of benthic invertebrates can be changed 

indirectly, since sediments can occupy interstitial habitats, reducing the 

abundance and/or quality of periphyton (food source for most invertebrates; 

Broekhuizen et al., 2001). 

Specific substrate types may determine and shape invertebrate 

communities present in streams. For example Oligochaeta, Sphariidae 

(Armitage, 1995), and Chironomidae larvae can be benefited by the abundance 

of fine sediments as they use these particles to construct cases and tubes 

(Dudgeon, 1994). Trichoptera belonging to the Families Glossossomatidae, 

Goeridae and Sericostomatidae use small pebbles to build cases, which 

provide shelter from predators (Schofield et al., 2004). But sediments can limit 

species survival (Jowett et al., 1991) by inhibiting, damaging or reducing their 

filter feeding capacity (Aldridge et al., 1987) and respiration structures (Lemly, 

1982), leading to an increase in drift (Gibbins et al., 2004; Larsen &amp;amp; Ormerod, 

2010). In fact, Suren &amp;amp; Jowett (2001) demonstrated that drift may be related 

with the size of sediments, with smaller sediments promoting higher rates of 

drift. Sediment inputs can increase drift directly due to particles, or indirectly 

because sediments may reduce the quality of food resources (Graham, 1990). 

Changes in habitat conditions promoted by sediments may also affect the 

invertebrates assemblages: Simuliidae larvae, for example, need clean rocks, 

not covered by sediments, to attach their silks (Management biodiversity issues, 

2001). Habitats predominated by either fine or large sediments are poorer than 

mixture environments, suggesting that the heterogeneity of the substratum is 



! 12!

usually related to high diversity of invertebrates, since sediment sizes can 

influence the bedload as well as its mobility (Gibbins et al., 2004). 

Mussels for example can also be affected by fine sediments: bivalves 

feed trough the filtration of water, so they are directly sensible to increases of 

sediments in the water column (Shin, et al., 2002). If females face limitation in 

food resources, the amount of nutrients needed for egg production is insufficient 

and reproduction might be affected (Landis et al., 2013). Furthermore, since 

sediments are often associated with pollutants, bivalves can bioaccumulate the 

pollutants present in the water (Shin, et al., 2002). 

Sediment impacts on fish are well documented, due to their economic 

and recreational importance (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997). The consequences of 

sediment loads on fish are vast: difficulty in swimming, decrease of growth rate, 

lower tolerance to diseases, and clogging of the gill filaments causing 

asphyxiation (Bruton, 1985), which can alter the usual migration patterns of fish 

(Alabaster &amp;amp; Lloyd, 1982). They can also change the feeding behavior, since an 

increase of suspended sediments can obstruct the filter feeding capacity 

(Aldridge et al., 1987). Also, fish species that are used to clean waters will be in 

disadvantage, and predator-prey relation may be changed (Ranåker et al., 

2012). Furthermore, deposited sediments can clog gravel-spawning grounds of 

several fish species affecting fish communities (Sear, 1993). 

 

It is known that rivers suffer flow variability, from floods to low flows, and 

this result in variations of the suspended solids concentrations, as well as on 

their deposition (Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997). Hence, benthic faunal communities 

is likely able to deal with these variations on sediment loads. Rapid increases of 



! 13!

sediment loads may allow a rapid recovery. Nevertheless, constant sediments 

input due to human activities can modify the natural fauna. Furthermore, the 

input of sediments to streams is usually associated with nutrient enrichment as 

a result of watershed logging (Benfield et al., 2001), chemicals input due to 

agriculture intensification (Liess et al., 1999) or even heavy metals and toxic 

substances pollution that can be aggregated to sediments (Gordon, 2004). 

Input of sediments into the streams is a natural process; it becomes a 

problem when higher inputs due to human activities affect and threat all natural 

cycles of the ecosystem (Management biodiversity issues, 2001). 

 

1.4. Main objectives 

In this study we assessed the effects of sediments, in transport or 

deposited, in leaves decomposition promoted by fungi and invertebrates. For 

that purpose, several experiments were carried out to assess the effect of water 

velocity (with consequent distinct intensities of bed-material loads) and 

sediment granulometry on microbial mediated decomposition. Tests were also 

performed in order to address invertebrates consumption in environments 

where their feeding behavior was challenged by high amounts of suspended 

bed-load or deposited sediment over the food items.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

2.1. General 

Oak (Quercus robur L.) leaves were collected after senescence, air dried 

in the dark at ambient temperature and stored until needed. Initial phosphorus, 

nitrogen and total phenols were determined (Graça et al. 2005). Before using 

the leaves, they were moistened with distilled water, in order to avoid breakage 

during handling. Leaves were assembled in groups of ~2 g in fine mesh bags 

(10 × 15 cm, 0.5 mm mesh) to avoid decomposition by macroinvertebrates. A 

total of 13 bags were incubated, for 21 (December, winter) or 10 days (March, 

spring), in a second order stream located at Lousã mountain, Central Portugal 

(Candal stream; 40º04’48.10’’N, 8º12’11.16’’W, 634 m a.s.l.). 

After the incubation periods, bags were brought to the laboratory in a 

cooler and were carefully rinsed with distilled water to remove attached 

sediments. Stream water samples were also transported to the laboratory, 

filtered (fiberglass filter, Millipore APFF) and frozen at –18 °C for determination 

of cations and anions by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-120, Sunnyvale, 

California, USA) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration (Allan &amp;amp; 

Castillo 2007). Stream substratum was collected and sieved in situ in order to 

obtain sediment &amp;lt;2 mm. Hereafter this sediment will be referred as real mixture 

(RM). In the laboratory, sediment was ignited (550ºC; 4 h) to remove organic 

matter; being separated in 2 size classes (&amp;lt;0.063 mm and &amp;lt;2 mm) using a 

sieve shaker (Fig. 3).

Candal stream (&amp;lt;2 mm) by size classes (&amp;lt;2 mm and &amp;lt;0.063 mm) 

 

2.2. Microbial-mediated decomposition tests 

2.2.1. Effects of sediment load velocity on leaves decomposition 

Ten pairs of leaf discs were symmetrically obtained from the conditioned 

leaves, with a cork borer (Ø = 12 mm). One disc of each pair was used to 

evaluate leaf toughness expressed as the required mass (g of water in a 

container) to push a 1 mm diameter metal shaft through the leaf disc. These 

discs were then oven-dried (105ºC; 48 h) and weighed to evaluate initial dry 

mass (DMi). The correspondent pairs were immersed in 20 Erlenmeyers of 500 

ml with 10 discs each, previously filled with 200 ml of filtered (filter paper) 

stream water. 

A total of 20 Erlenmeyers (each one with a total of 10 discs obtained as 

above) were divided into two horizontal shakers rotating at 60 or 120 rotations 



! 17!

per minute (rpm) (Fig. 4). In each shaker, half the Erlenmeyers (n = 5) were 

provided with 26 g of RM while the other half only contained stream water. 

Incubation lasted for 4 weeks, in an acclimatized room at 15 ± 2ºC. At the end 

of the experiment, sets of 5 discs from each replicate were used to determine 

sporulation. For subsequent counting, all conidial suspensions were mixed with 

100 µl of Triton X – 100 solution (0.5%), an aliquot was filtered (Millipore 

SMWP, 5 µm pore size) and the spores retained stained with 0.05% cotton blue 

in acid lactic (60%). Spores were counted under a compound microscope at 

250× (Graça et al. 2005).  

All incubated leaf discs were oven dried (105ºC; 48h) and weighted. 

Remaining dry mass was evaluated as the difference between the initial and the 

final dry mass of the leaf circles in each microscosm. 

 

2.2.2. Effects of sediment size on leaf litter decomposition 

Oak leaves conditioned in the stream for ten days (in Spring) were used 

to obtain pairs of leaf discs as above: half the discs were oven-dried (105ºC; 

48h) and weighted to determine initial dry mass. The correspondent pairs were 

equitatively distributed by Erlenmeyers, in groups of ten: groups of five 

Erlenmeyers were provided with 26 g of RM, 26 g of extra fine sediment (Ø &amp;lt;

0.063 mm; EFS treatment) or No sediment was added. After this period, as 

above, sets of five discs from each microcosm were used to induce sporulation. 

For counting and identification, all conidial suspensions were mixed with 100 µl 

of Triton X – 100 solution (0.5%), an aliquot was filtered (Millipore SMWP, 5 µm 

pore size) and the spores retained were stained with 0.05% cotton blue in acid 

lactic (60%). Spores were identified and counted under a compound 



! 18!

microscope at 250× (Graça et al. 2005). Sporulation rates were expressed as 

number of conidia/mg DM/day. 

 

Three out of the ten leaf discs from each microcosm were used to 

evaluate ergosterol content as a proxy of fungal biomass (Gessner &amp;amp; Chauvet 

1993; Young, 1995).!Leaf discs from all replicates and treatments were freeze 

dried, lyophilized and weighted. Ergosterol extraction was performed according 

to Gessner et al. (2003): ergosterol concentration was quantified by high 

performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Merck LiChroCART 250-4 

(LiChrospher 100) RP-18 column, by measuring absorbance at 282 nm (Young 

1995).!Ergosterol was converted into fungal biomass using a conversion factor 

of 5.5 µg ergosterol/mg fungal DM (Gessner &amp;amp; Chauvet, 1993). Results were 

expressed as mg fungal biomass/g DM. Dry Mass remaining (DMr) was 

evaluated and expressed as percentage of initial dry mass. 

 

2.3. Invertebrates feeding tests 

Larvae of Sericostoma vittatum Rambur (Trichoptera; Sericostomatidae) 

were collected in a low-order stream of Central Portugal (Ribeira de São João, 

Lousã mountain, Central Portugal; 40º05’59”N, 8º14’02”W) and transported to 

the laboratory in cooled plastic boxes. In the laboratory, animals were kept in 

plastic containers filled with stream water with stream sediment in the bottom 

(15ºC; 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod). They were fed ad libitum with stream 

conditioned oak leaves. 

Consumption tests were run with individuals of medium size (8.8 mg ± 

3.3) evaluated using the diameter of their case opening; relationship between 



! 19!

the case opening and dry mass was achieved by the formula: DM = 0.0136 x 

CO – 0.0162 (R2 = 0.83) where DM is dry mass (mg) and CO is case opening 

(mm) (Ferreira et al., 2010). 

In all tests, measured individuals were starved for 24 h prior to the 

experiments and then randomly allocated in the microcosms (5.5 cm diameter; 

15.5 cm height) provided with ignited (550ºC; 4 h) stream sediment (EFS or 

RM) at the bottom, and filled with 300 ml of filtered stream water (filter paper) 

continuously aerated. Experiments were stopped when half of the discs were 

eaten in 50% of the microcosms. 

 

2.3.1. Effects of sediment in suspension on invertebrates consumption 

A total of 60 microcosms were provided with 3 g of sediment (&amp;lt;0.063 

mm). In half of the containers a longer oxygenation tube (Suspended sediments 

treatment; SS) ensured a higher turbulence of the water, allowing the sediments 

to be continuously suspended in the water column instead of deposited in 

bottom (Control treatment; C). Three small stones were placed in each 

container in order to provide the possibility of refuge from turbulence to the 

invertebrates. At the beginning of the experiments, two symmetrical discs were 

cut from the conditioned oak leaves conditioned in the stream; leaf discs were 

obtained avoiding the central vein. Discs from each pair were assumed to have 

identical initial mass. Each microscosm was provided with one oak disc placed 

on the top of the sediments and another enclosed in a fine mesh bag (0.5 mm 

mesh size; 3 x 4 cm) attached with a clip to the top of the microscosm. This bag 

was kept inside the water, but no contact was allowed between the leaf disc 

and the animal (control disc). The discs were stuck to the bottom of the cup with 



! 20!

pins to ensure food availability in spite of the turbulence. Oxygenation and total 

dissolved solids (TDS) were daily monitored. Samples of water were taken from 

each microscosm at three water depths (top, middle and bottom) in order to 

check for sediment suspension uniformity. In this case, 2 ml of water were 

collected with a plastic pipette, placed into pre-weighed eppendorf tubes, 

centrifuged and dried (60ºC; 48 hours). Eppendorf tubes were then re-weighted 

and sediment quantity trapped in the water column assessed as the difference 

between the eppendorfs weight. After 2 days, the experiment was stopped and 

discs were dried (60° C; 48 h). Consumption in each microcosm was estimated 

as the difference between the control and the correspondent disc offered to the 

animal. Consumption was expressed as mg leaf consumed/g animal/day. 

  

2.3.2 Effects of sediment deposition on food consumption 

A total of 45 microcosms were provided with 90 g of ignited RM 

originating a total sediment depth in the microcosm of 3 cm. Pre-measured S. 

vittatum larvae were randomly distributed by the microscosms and carefully 

placed on the top of the sediment. For each microscosm, two symmetrical discs 

were cut as above from the conditioned oak leaves avoiding the central vein; 

one was used to feed the animal and the other placed inside a fine mesh bag 

(0.5 mm mesh size; 3 x 4 cm) in order to prevent invertebrate’s consumption – 

control disc. On the first treatment (n = 15) a single disc hold by a pin were 

placed on the top of sediment (hereafter called Top); on second treatment 

(n=15) the leaf disc was placed in mid-depth of the sediment (~1.5 cm depth; 

hereafter called Middle) while the last fifteen replicates had the disc placed in 

the bottom of the sediment (3 cm depth; hereafter called Bottom). The 



! 21!

experiment lasted for 6 days when 50% of the discs were half eaten by half the 

invertebrates in one of the treatments. 

 

2.4. Data analysis 

Leaves mass loss and toughness promoted by sediment abrasion at two 

water velocities, and sporulation rates observed in each treatment were 

compared by 2-way analyses of variance (ANOVA). 

The effect of sediment granulometry on leaf mass loss, fungal biomass 

sporulation rates and total number of aquatic hyphomycete species were 

compared by 1-way ANOVA. Whenever necessary, a Tukey test was used. 

Leaf species specific fungal assemblages associated to all sediment treatment 

were analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination, 

based on Bray Curtis similarity index of log (x+1) transformed conidial 

abundance data (PRIMER v6; Clarke &amp;amp; Gorley, 2001). An analysis of similarity 

(1-way ANOSIM) was also performed to test the similarity between treatments, 

with sediment granulometry as factor. 

Leaves consumption by the invertebrates under distinct sediment 

suspension intensity was compared by a t-test. Invertebrate consumption of 

leaves covered by sediment was compared among treatments by 1-way 

ANOVA, followed by Tukey test whenever necessary. 

Data were log (x+1) transformed when necessary to achieve the 

assumptions, normality and homogeneity of variances. All statistical analyses 

were performed to a significance level of P = 0.05 and carried out using 

STATISTICA v7 for Windows.

3. RESULTS 

 

In Candal stream, the water was well oxygenated (&gt;100%), circumneutral 

(pH = 6.8) and nutrient poor (NO3- = 537 µg/L; NH4+ = 10 µg/L; soluble reactive 

phosphorus = 45.33 µg/L). 

The physico-chemical characteristics of the pre-conditioned oak leaves 

(mean ± SE; n = 3) incubated in the stream for 28 (Winter) and 10 days (Spring) 

are shown in table I. Differences in incubation time were decided in order to 

provide similar leaf conditioning status in the leaves used in both microbial 

mediated experiments due to differences in mean water temperature (Winter, 

6.3 ± 0.2; Spring, 11.9 ± 0.3).

3.1.1. Effects of sediment load velocity on leaves decomposition 

Dry mass remaining (P &gt; 0.16; Fig.4), leaf toughness (P &gt; 0.14; Fig. 5) 

and sporulation rates (P &gt; 0.39; Fig. 6) of the pre conditioned oak leaves were 

not different among treatments (presence of sediments and sediment loads 

velocity). Dry mass remaining varied between 35% (at 120 rpm with sediment) 

and 39% (at 60 rpm with sediment).

3.1.2. Effects of sediment size on leaf litter decomposition 

Sediment granulometry affected leaves mass loss (P = 0.02; Fig. 7). 

Significant differences were found in leaves mass loss between the real mixture 

and particles smaller than 0.063 mm (Tukey test, P = 0.02). Dry mass 

remaining was highest in leaves conditioned in the presence of the finest 

sediment. No significant differences were found between dry mass remaining of 

the control leaves (No sediment) and the other treatments (RM or EFS; Tukey 

test, P &gt; 0.07). 

The presence of sediment did not affect fungal biomass associated with 

the oak leaves (1-way ANOVA; P = 0.43; Fig. 8). However, an obvious 

decrease in the amount of biomass associated with the leaves was observed:

fungal biomass of leaves incubated with no sediment attained values twice as 

high as the leaves incubated in microcosms with EFS (439.60 mg/g in No 

sediment vs. 239.30 mg/g in the EFS). 

The presence of sediment seems to stimulate sporulation rates, which 

was highest in leaves conditioned in microcosms with sediment &amp;lt;0.063 mm. 

Significant differences were found among treatments (1-way ANOVA; P &amp;lt;0.05; 

Fig. 9). Accordingly, the lowest number of fungal species was found in the No 

sediment treatment and the highest number in the EFS treatment; significant 

differences were found between these two treatments (Tukey’s test; P = 0.02). 

The total number of species increased in the order No sediment &amp;lt;RM &amp;lt;EFS 

(Fig. 10). The structure of oak fungal communities was consistently affected by 

the sediment granulometry (1-way ANOSIM, R = 0.77, P = 0.004). In fact, the 

major communities’ differences were promoted by the presence of sediments, 

but the effects tended to be attenuated when we consider the sediment sizes 

(Fig. 11).! Articulospora tetracladia dominated in the No sediment treatment 

while T. elegans was only dominant in the presence of sediments. Results 

suggest that the sporulating capacity of Flagellospora curta may be affected by 

the presence of sediment independently of the granulometry (Fig. 12).

Sericostoma vitattum. Consumption of conditioned oak leaves was significantly 

higher when the disc was at the top of the sediment (1-way ANOVA; P &amp;lt;0.01; 

Fig.14). Although no significant differences were found between the other two 

treatments (middle and bottom), leaves that were less buried in the sediment 

(1.5 cm) were 58% more consumed than the leaves maintained at 3 cm depth. 

In this case consumption was negligible (7.85 mg leaf/g animal/day).

4. DISCUSSION 

 

The number of studies on the importance of sediment loads or sediment 

deposition on leaves decomposition and shredder ecology are still few 

considering the spatial dimension and relevance of this problem to streams 

ecological integrity (Cornut et al., 2010; Matthaei et al., 2010), and the results 

gathered are frequently contradictory. Furthermore, it is difficult to isolate the 

impacts of sedimentation on the biota or stream processes, because 

sedimentation is most of the times associated to other factors like nutrient 

enrichment or canopy removal (Schofield et al., 2004). To avoid this problem, a 

large number of studies (e.g. Rosenberg &amp;amp; Wiens, 1978; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 

2011) were performed in artificial streams or in laboratory (this one included); 

although such approaches are accurate and scientifically sound they make 

difficult to assess biotic interactions (Schofield et al., 2004) and to extrapolate 

results for real ecosystems. Nonetheless they certainly help to explain the 

effects of sedimentation observed in stream communities, in particular stream 

macroinvertebrates (Piggott et al., 2012) and processes as leaf decomposition 

(Cornut et al., 2010; Danger et al., 2012). In this study the effects of sediment 

loads were assessed at two distinct levels: microbial-mediated decomposition 

and invertebrate-mediated decomposition of leaf litter, evaluating the effects of 

sediments on the main protagonists of leaves processing in heterotrophic 

systems based on detritus - microbes (mainly Aquatic Hyphomycetes) and 

shredders - and their function. Results pointed to specific impacts at both basic 

levels of the stream detrital-based food chains, which may suggest potential 

bottom-up consequences in the stream biota.

Bedload of fine sediments (simulated by microcosms shaking) did not 

affect leaves degradation promoted by fungi; a higher water velocity (120 rpm) 

did not affect leaves mass loss, toughness or sporulation rates. This was 

partially surprising, as higher water velocities are known to stimulate sporulation 

rates and the number of conidia produced, independently of the colonization 

rate (Ferreira et al. 2006). Furthermore, the presence of sediments may 

increase friction by rolling and sliding on the leaves surface potentially 

stimulating mycelial growth, which could determine an increase in the number 

of spores produced. Such effects did not seem to have occurred since mass 

loss or toughness decrease (also a proxy of leaves mass loss; Medeiros et al., 

2009) promoted by fungal activities did not differ between water velocities. The 

present results are in agreement with Sanpera-Calbet et al. (2011). These 

authors associated the lack of sediments effect with the initial colonization of 

the leaves. Since all leaves were colonized with no sediments, the following 

contact with this material made no difference (once fixed on the leaf substrate, 

spores germinate quickly and mycelia adhere to the leaves; Dang et al., 2007). 

On the other hand, significant differences between treatments were expected 

since higher water velocity, like the one observed in riffles, is known to promote 

higher physical fragmentation in comparison with pools or dam zones, where 

the flow is reduced and leaves decompose slowly (Casas, 1996; Young et al., 

2008). In fact, several studies argue in favour of significant effect of sediment 

loads on leaves decomposition (Benfield et al., 2001; Matthaei et al., 2010). It 

seems possible that the incubation period of the leaves in the stream was too 

long (in spite of low winter temperatures) or that heavy precipitation during the 

conditioning period in the stream promoted an excessive degradation of the 



! 39!

leaves used in the microcosms, masking the potential differences between 

treatments. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the amount of 

sediments added or even the water velocity was not sufficient to accelerate the 

process of breakdown by physical abrasion (Schofield et al., 2004). 

 

Sediment granulometry affected leaves decomposition. A heterogeneous 

fine sediment (Ø &amp;lt;2 mm; RM) seem to maintain/stimulate leaves mass loss 

while the EFS sediment tend to depress leaves degradation. Although no 

significant differences could be observed in fungal biomass (p &amp;lt;0.43) the 

concentration of ergosterol evaluated in leaves incubated in microcosms with 

EFS showed about half the values of the leaves incubated in No sediment or 

RM microcosms, which suggests that such small particle sizes may depress 

fungal growth, and mass loss. Leaves in the microcosms could have been 

buried and protected from turbulence and collisions of the sediment during 

rotation. In this treatment, and in spite of the water movement (120 rpm), the 

contact between the water and the leaves may be limited by an eventual 

sediment compaction inhibiting O2 access to the mycelium." Such decrease in 

fungal biomass may be in agreement with Kreutzweiser and co-workers (2005) 

results that indicate that fine sediments can decrease the palatability to 

shredders due to a lower microbial activity. In opposition, a heterogeneous 

substratum as the one present in the real mixture may favor oxygenation that, 

along with the sediments abrasion effect (in particular of the larger particles; 

Heard et al., 1999; Young et al., 2008), may facilitate leaves mycelial growth 

and breakdown. Although this could not be confirmed by our results, it seems 

clear that the smaller the particle size, the higher the sporulation rates and total 



! 40!

number of fungal species in the media. A clear reproductive investment occurs 

in the presence of sediments, in particular of EFS. This was unexpected as the 

presence of sediments is usually associated with a decrease in number of 

species (Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011) and not the opposite. Nonetheless, we 

could detect a clear effect of the presence of sediments (both types) on fungal 

assemblages structure in relation to the media with no sediment. The higher 

contribution was done by Tetrachaetum elegans (30%), followed by 

Clavariopsis chaetocladium (27%).! Articulospora tetracladia is abundantly 

present in all treatments (50% in no sediment; 22% in real mixture; 26% in 

EFS), showing that it is a specie well adapted for different sediment conditions 

(Medeiros et al., 2009; Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011). 

Surprisingly, T. elegans was found in all treatments and well represented; other 

studies showed that this specie is usually very sensitive to sediments and 

inhibited in their presence (Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011). 

These differences in the composition and structure of fungal assemblages 

between treatments indicate that different species present different answers to 

the stress promoted by the sediments. It seems possible that the reduced O2 

levels nearby the leaves (particularly in EFS) might have reduced the mycelial 

growth of dominant species, reducing competition and allowing other species to 

grow and sporulate. It is generally accepted that sporulation may occur in 

hypoxic/anoxic media as the hyporheic areas (e.g. Bärlocher et al., 2008; 

Cornut et al., 2011), and that species differ in their tolerance to low levels of O2 

(Medeiros et al., 2009). In fact, it is not completely clear why we registered 

increasing sporulation rates and diversity from no sediment &amp;lt;real sediment &amp;lt;



! 41!

extra fine sediment; a “survival” strategy may eventually help to understand the 

results. 

Sediment cumulating on leaves affected invertebrates consumption. 

Shredders consumption decreased between 63% (middle) and 76% (bottom) 

when leaves were buried in the substratum. Although the depth effect of 

sediment on leaves decomposition promoted by shredders was previously 

stated (Cornut et al., 2010; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011; Danger et al., 2012)  

this is, to my knowledge, the first study where the effect of depth was 

considered independently of the leaf litter quality as all leaf circles had a similar 

conditioning period. S. vittatum larvae seem unable to locate the food source if 

sediments are buried. The mechanisms of food location by shredders are still 

not clear, but it seems that the chemical clues possibly guiding the invertebrates 

to their food sources (e.g. Rong et al, 1995) may be limited by the presence of 

few centimetres of sediment. It seems possible that a limited burying capacity of 

the invertebrates could constitute an impediment to gain access to buried 

leaves; however, according to the Sericostoma larvae distribution in the stream, 

the capacity of digging the sediment does not seem to be an issue. Although a 

finer scale of depths should be further used to assess the effects of sediment 

deposition on invertebrates feeding behaviour (leaves coated by the sediment 

seem to be consumed by the invertebrates), this study indicates that sediments 

deposition of over 1.5 cm may inhibit foraging. This may suggest that sediment 

loads may clearly affect not only the quality but also the quantity of available 

resources to the invertebrates, with potential consequences on population 

dynamics. In fact, considering our results, the proclaimed idea that the adverse 



! 42!

effects of sediments are reduced or negligible when they are present in low to 

moderate concentration (Fairchild et al., 1987) might be challenged. 

Contrary to my expectations, suspended sediments in the microcosms 

did not affect shredders consumption. This is in accordance with Schofield et 

al., (2004) and Sanpera-Calbet et al. (2011), but in contradiction with most 

studies (Bunn, 1988; Benfield et al., 2001; Sponseller &amp;amp; Benfield, 2001 and 

Matthaei et al., 2010). In fact it seems that this species, like other invertebrates 

(e.g. Gammarus; Sanpera-Calbet et al., 2011), may be resistant to short term 

stress promoted by sediments, in particular when refuge (stone) and food are 

available. It seems likely that the presence of the case in Sericostoma allows an 

additional protection to the impact of the suspended bed material load. It is still 

not known which is the limit of sediment load tolerated by this species, or what 

would be the impact if this sedimentation lasted for longer periods. Sediment 

increase can have a major influence on several aspects such as biomass, 

diversity and even change in drift behaviour of macroinvertebrates (Quinn et al., 

1992; Wood &amp;amp; Armitage, 1997), which tend to support the idea of a threshold of 

tolerance for each species, likely modulated by other environmental factors 

(e.g. water temperature, pH or current velocity). 

Briefly, our laboratorial results suggest that the granulometry of the 

sediments may affect the decomposition dynamics through physical 

fragmentation, direct and indirect (O2 availability) effects on microbial 

assemblages, colonization status and shredders performance. It is generally 

recognized that invertebrates prefer colonized detritus and may present specific 

feeding behaviour towards particular fungal species or assemblages (Canhoto 

&amp;amp; Graça 2008). Although it was already stated that leaves burial may affect its 



! 43!

quality due to lower concentration of oxygen, influencing the fungal biomass 

(Cornut et al., 2010; Danger et al., 2012), this study contributes to the 

recognition of the sediment impairment on the foraging behaviour promoted by 

very thin layers of sediment. Most likely, sediments accumulation inhibits the 

diffusion of signals needed for food detection. S. vittatum larvae were able to 

maintain their feeding behaviour in the presence of high amounts of suspended 

sediments in a turbulent aquatic environment most likely due to its protective 

case. It remains unclear if such behaviour will be maintained for longer periods 

and in what extent. 

The effect of sediments transport should be assessed in the future, by 

controlling flow in natural streams, and during a longer exposure, in order to 

understand the behaviour of the invertebrates. Also, tests with leaves buried at 

different depths and with different shredders should be done. 

 

4.1. Final Remarks 

There is no doubt that sediment loads are a natural feature of the 

streams; the problem is the unnatural increase of sediment inputs due to 

anthropogenic activities. It is therefore fundamental to understand how these 

changes will affect aquatic habitats as well as the whole ecosystem. Activities 

like agriculture and deforestation are becoming a threat to stream ecosystem 

functions. It is important to take in consideration the recovery of riparian forests, 

since they give the necessary resources for streams and act as a natural 

stopper and filter for sediments inputs (Cavalcanti &amp;amp; Lockaby, 2005), also 

avoiding margins erosion and an intensification on sedimentation and turbidity 

(Swank et al., 2001).
