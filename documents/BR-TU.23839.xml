resumo A capacidade dos microrganismos utilizarem hidrocarbonetos de petróleo
como fonte de carbono e energia é crucial na reciclagem destes compostos
nos meios marinhos. Apesar da importância deste processo muitos dos
aspectos da degradação microbiana de hidrocarbonetos em alguns habitats
específicos e na perspetiva de diferentes cenários de alterações climáticas são
ainda desconhecidos.
Na primeira fase deste trabalho, a fracção cultivável das bactérias com
capacidade para degradar hidrocarbonetos de petróleo na microcamada
superficial marinha de um sistema estuarino (Ria de Aveiro) foi caracterizada.
Na segunda fase, o impacto da contaminação por petróleo nas comunidades
microbianas em diferentes cenários de alterações climáticas foi estudado.
O género Pseudomonas revelou ser preponderante na fracção cultivável das
bactérias degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos na microcamada superficial
marinha. Além disso, os métodos independentes de cultivo revelaram que a
abundancia relativa e diversidade da classe Gammaproteobacteria, na qual se
inclui o género Pseudomonas, é diferente ao longo de um gradiente estuarino
de contaminação.
De forma a caracterizar o impacto da contaminação por petróleo nas
comunidades microbianas sob diferentes cenários de alterações climáticas, um
sistema de suporte de vida (ELSS) foi construído com o objectivo de realizar
experiências de microcosmo. O ELSS permite simular e controlar aspectos
fundamentais da dinâmica de sistemas costeiros e estuarinos preservando os
elementos mais representativos da comunidade bacteriana original. Com este
sistema foi possível realizar uma experiência onde o impacto independente e
combinado da radiação ultravioleta, acidificação da água e contaminação por
petróleo sobre comunidades bacterianas foi determinado. O impacto na
estrutura das comunidades foi avaliado através de pirosequenciação do 16S
RNA (cDNA). A ordem Desulfobacterales sofreu uma redução de abundância
relativa muito significativa em resposta à contaminação por petróleo para uma
redução de pH estimada para 2100. Uma vez que os membros desta ordem
desempenham um papel crucial na degradação de hidrocarbonetos de
petróleo, a reciclagem destes compostos em ambientes costeiros e estuarinos
pode ser alterada em cenários ambientais futuros. A previsão do metagenoma
a partir da base de dados do 16S RNA indica que várias vias de degradação
de hidrocarbonetos de petróleo podem ser afectadas. Os resultados obtidos
neste trabalho acescentam novas pistas sobre o papel das bactérias
degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos em ambientes costeiros e estuarinos nos
contextos ambientais actuais e futuro.

abstract The ability of microorganisms to use oil hydrocarbons as a source of carbon
and energy is crucial for environmental oil detoxification. However, there is still
a lack of knowledge on fundamental aspects of this process on specific habitats
and under different climate scenarios.
In the first phase of this work, the culturable fraction of the oil hydrocarbon (OH)
degrading bacteria from the sea surface microlayer (SML) of the estuarine
system Ria de Aveiro was characterized. In the second phase, the impact of oil
contamination on the active bacterial community was studied under climate
change scenarios. Pseudomonas emerged as the prevailing genera among OH
degrading bacteria in the SML. Moreover, culture-independent methods
revealed that the relative abundance and diversity of Gammaproteobacteria, in
which Pseudomonas is included, varies along an estuarine gradient of
contamination.
In order to access the impact of oil contamination on microbial communities
under climate change scenarios, an experimental life support system for
microcosm experiments (ELLS) was developed and validated for simulation of
climate change effects on microbial communities. With the ELSS it is possible
to simulate, in controlled conditions, fundamental parameters of the dynamics
of coastal and estuarine systems while maintaining community structure in
terms of the abundance of the most relevant members of the indigenous
bacterial community. A microcosm experiment in which the independent and
combined impact of ultraviolet radiation, ocean acidification and oil
contamination on microbial communities was conducted. The impact on
bacterial communities was accessed with a 16S RNA (cDNA) based barcode
pyrosequencing approach. There was a drastic decrease of Desulfobacterales
relative abundance after oil contamination under the reduced pH value
estimated for 2100, when compared to present values. Since members of this
order are known OH degraders, such a significant decrease may have
consequences on OH detoxification of contaminated environments under the
pH levels of the ocean expected for the future. Metagenome predictions based
on the 16S RNA database indicated that several degradation pathways of OH
could be affected under oil contamination and reduced water pH. Taken
together, the results from this work bring new information on the dynamics of
OH degrading bacteria in coastal and estuarine environments under present
and future climate scenarios.

Justification, objectives and thesis outline

Microbial communities have been shown to play a key role in pollutant detoxification

in marine environments. The environmental importance of this process is such that the

world´s ocean would be literally covered with oil, if bacteria were not catabolising these

compounds (Head et al., 2006). The ability of bacteria to use petroleum hydrocarbons as

energy and carbon source has been studied in detail (Bamforth et al., 2005). However there is

still a lack of knowledge on fundamental aspects of this process in specific habitats and under

different environmental scenarios. For example, although the sea surface microlayer (SML)

covers almost 70% of the earth surface and oil hydrocarbons tends to concentrate there (Wurl

et al., 2004), little is known about the structure of the hydrocarbon degrading bacterial

community inhabiting this particular water compartment.

Concurrently, the impact of climate change scenarios, such as ocean acidification and

increase ultraviolet radiation (UVR), on microbial interactions with oil hydrocarbons is not

known. Ocean acidification and UVR have the potential to significantly impact microbial

community structure and function. Among other effects, modifications can impact microbial

mediated detoxification processes, with unpredictable effects on metabolic pathways and

toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants.

There is an urgent need for a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions

involving bacteria, pollutants and climate factors. This knowledge can ultimately lead to more

accurate predictions of shifts in microbial communities and in pollutant toxicity under climate

change scenarios and to the development of new microbial-based remediation technologies.

However, the complexity of biological, chemical and environmental interactions in natural

environments restricts our ability to establish cause-effect relationships. Understanding the

interactions of global climate change and pollutants on living organisms is a complex task that

entails the study of a multitude of interactions. This demands innovative and statistically

robust experiments conducted under controlled conditions during which biological and non-

biological markers of environmental function can be identified and measured.

The general objective of this work was to gain fundamental knowledge on the

interactions of microbial communities with oil hydrocarbon pollutants in marine

environments. First, from a phenomenological perspective, the hydrocarbon degrading

microbial communities were characterized in a model environment. Second, from a more

mechanistic view, the effects of a crude oil spill in the microbial communities of estuarine

sediment were assessed under controlled climate change scenarios.

Three specific objectives were formulated in order to accomplish the general objective:

To characterize the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria of the sea surface microlayer in a

chronically oil polluted estuarine system;

To develop an innovative framework that would enable statistically robust microcosm

simulations of climate change scenarios in marine environments;

To characterize the synergistic effects between ocean acidification, ultraviolet radiation and

anthropogenic pollutants on microbial communities.

In Chapter 1 a brief introduction that focus the relevance of oil hydrocarbon bacterial
degradation and the current knowledge on the effects of climate change and anthropogenic

pollution interactions on microbial communities is presented.

Chapter 2 addresses objective 1 by examining for the first time the oil hydrocarbon
degrading bacteria in a estuarine surface microlayer. Pseudomonas was the dominant group

among the culturable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading bacteria. Screening

for specific genes involved in PAH degradation revealed that identical genes were present in

two phylogenetically distinct isolates, thus suggesting that horizontal transfer of genes might

be fundamental in PAH degradation in the SML. Culture-independent analysis revealed that

although the general structure of the bacterial community remains unchanged along a

contamination gradient, the relative abundance and diversity of organisms of The

Gammaproteobacteria group, including those of the genus Pseudomonas, reveals differences. These

findings highlight the importance of SML-adapted oil hydrocarbon degrading bacteria with

potential use in bioremediation of polluted ecosystems. This chapter was published in the

journal Aquatic and Microbial Ecology.
Chapter 3 describes the architecture and validation of a microcosm framework

designed to study the interactive effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollution on

marine benthic communities. This chapter addresses objective 2. This system, named

experimental life support system (ELSS), allows simulating climate change scenarios under

high controlled conditions. In this chapter, the validation of the reproducibility and

environmental quality of this system was achieved by comparing chemical and biological

parameters recorded in the ELSS with those prevalent in the natural environment. Average

concentration of inorganic nutrients remained stable during ELSS functioning. Although

some shifts in bacterial community composition were observed between in situ and ELSS

sediment samples, the relative abundance of the most abundant metabolically active bacterial

taxa was stable. In addition, ELSS operation did not affect survival, oxidative stress and

neurological biomarkers of the model organism Hedistes diversicolor. The validation data thus

supports the use of this system to address objective 3. This chapter was published as a

technical advance in the journal Global Change Biology, ranked third (following Nature and
Science) in the list of the most-cited journals in climate change research.

Chapter 4 addresses objective 3 by examining the interactive effects of ocean
acidification and ultraviolet radiation in estuarine sediment microbial communities. The effects

on the active bacterial community were characterized by using a barcoded pyrosequencing

approach of the 16S rRNA (cDNA). The most drastic change detected was a reduction in

anaerobic sulphate reducing bacteria under oil contamination and reduced pH values. Given

the role of sulphate reducing bacteria in anaerobic oil hydrocarbon degradation we used

PICRUSTs to predict the community metagenome and on focused specific contaminant

degradation pathways. The predicted metagenomes revealed that under oil contamination and

reduced pH, several contaminant degradation pathways were affected. These results suggest

that in future ocean reduced pH conditions the impact of an oil spill can be substantially

different than under current pH levels.

Chapter 5 discusses the experimental design and the main conclusions. The
Appendix is a review published in the journal Ecology and Evolution journal that combines
sections of the introduction and discussion of this thesis.

Introduction

Microbial degradation of oil hydrocarbons

Oil hydrocarbons (OH) comprise several persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and

represent the most widespread pollutant in oceans worldwide. Natural seepage alone

introduces about 600000 metric tons of natural crude oil per year in our oceans representing

47% of crude oil entering the marine environment. The remaining 53% results from

anthropogenic activities (accidental oil spills, transport activities, refining, storage, and others)

(Kvenvolden et al., 2003).

Crude oils are complex mixtures of many different hydrocarbons and organic

molecules. Petroleum components, for example, can be classified by thin-layer

chromatography as saturate, aromatic, resins and asphaltenes (Garrett et al., 1998). The

saturated fraction includes the linear and branched chain alkanes and cycloalkanes, while the

aromatic fraction consists of the aromatic mono- or polycyclic compounds (Garrett et al.,

1998)

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are among the most common compounds

associated to OH pollution and probably the most recalcitrant and therefore categorized as

POPs. They are widespread in soil, water and air and are known to be genotoxic, carcinogenic

and susceptible to bioaccumulation (Newsted et al., 1987). The solubility of these pollutants is

generally low and decreases as the molecular weight increases. Due to their chemical

characteristics, PAH tend to adsorb to solid particles such as soils and sediments, or to

concentrate at the SML (Wurl et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2009). Very often, adorption contributes

to their stability and persistence in the environment.

Microorganisms have developed the ability to metabolize or degrade oil hydrocarbons

as a source of energy and carbon. The oil-catabolic versatility of marine microorganisms,

especially bacteria, is such that the world´s oceans would be literally covered with a layer of oil

if bacteria could not metabolize these compounds (Head et al., 2006). Hydrocarbonoclastic

(OH degraders) bacteria can be found in marine ecosystems in the SML, in underlying water

and in sediments. Several marine bacteria capable of metabolizing petroleum hydrocarbons,

namely Alcalinovorax (Yakimov et al., 1972) Cycloclasticus (Dyksterhouse et al., 1995), Oleiphilus

(Golyshin et al., 2002) and Oleispira (Yakimov, 2003) have been isolated from marine

environments. Commonly, these organisms are found in low abundance in pristine

environments and in areas exposed to low levels of OH pollution, but they can rapidly

respond to OH contamination with an increase in biomass and activity (Gomes et al., 2005,

Yakimov et al., 2005). Information on the ecology and physiology of in situ PAH detoxification

is largely available in the scientific literature, which supports a fairly extensive understanding

on the process of environmental PAH detoxification (Kasai et al., 2002, Ro et al., 2002, Head et

al., 2006, Gomes et al., 2007). The metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions involved in the

microbial aerobic degradation of naphthalene have been studied in detail. The basis of these

mechanisms is the oxidation of the PAH aromatic ring by the action of dioxygenase enzymes,

followed by the systematic breakdown into PAH metabolites and CO2 (Bamforth et al., 2005).

Anaerobic degradation of PAH occurs at lower rates, but it might play an essential role in the

long-term detoxification of soil and sediments (Zhang et al., 2011). The hydrocarbonoclastic

bacteria are important players in environmental OH detoxification through a complex process

in which environmental factors and biological activities interact. Also, it may involve the

synergistic contribution of enzymatic pathways operated by several other functional groups

rather than exclusively assigned to OH-degrading populations (Head et al., 2006).

Interactions between climate change and anthropogenic pollution

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), mainly through the burning of

fossil fuels, have increased from approximately 280 ppmv (parts per million volume) in

preindustrial times (Indermühle et al., 1999) to nearly 394 ppmv in 2012 (NOAA Earth System

Research Laboratory, 2012). The postulated impact of elevated CO2 levels on the earth's

temperature is only one, although probably the best known, of the consequences of the

increased CO2 concentrations. Increased atmospheric CO2 also causes a net air-to-sea flux of

CO2, reducing seawater pH and inducing modifications in the chemical balance between

inorganic carbon species. This process, known as ocean acidification, is often referred to as

“the other CO2 problem” (Doney et al., 2009, Doney, 2010). Since ocean acidification is a

direct consequence of the increase of the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere, it does

not depend on uncertainties related with other climate change predictions (Doney et al., 2009).

Although international treaties have been effective in reducing atmospheric

concentrations of ozone depleting substances (UNEP, 2012), increased concentrations of

greenhouse gases have the potential to affect the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange

between the stratosphere and the troposphere. This, in turn, will impact ultraviolet radiation

(UVR) levels reaching the earth’s surface (Bais et al., 2011). Global warming, ocean

acidification and changes in oceanic stratification patterns, are also expected to increase the

penetration of UV radiation in the water column and enhance the exposure of aquatic

organisms to UV-B in the future (UNEP, 2010). Importantly, increased UVR has been shown

to disrupt aquatic food webs and reduce the biological sinking capacity of atmospheric CO2
(Hader et al., 2007, Fabry et al., 2008).

Anthropogenic activities have been seriously and adversely affecting marine

ecosystems for decades with a continuous influx of pollutants including oil hydrocarbons

(OH), pesticides and heavy metals (Doney, 2010). Ocean acidification and UVR have the

potential to interact synergistically with a range of natural organic compounds and

environmental pollutants, with deleterious effects on oceanic ecosystems. An alert on the

possibility that ocean acidification in synergy with anthropogenic stressors could lead to

widespread changes in marine ecosystems was recently sent (Fabry et al., 2008). However, the

exact nature of such changes was not discussed.

Figure I-1: Interactions between ultraviolet radiation, ocean acidification, anthropogenic pollution and microbial
communities. Climate change has the potential to influence pollutant toxicity by acting directly on pollutant
chemistry or indirectly by affecting microbial mediated detoxification. Both have the potential to act

synergistically on microbial communities and possible on microbial mediated processes.



Introduction

Despite the important role microbial assemblages play in the global recycling of

anthropogenic pollutants, the potential interactive effects of UVR, ocean acidification and

anthropogenic pollutants on marine microbial communities have been largely ignored. Little is

known about how pollutant pathways may change under different climate change scenarios

and how this will affect biogeochemical cycling. Moreover, although microbial assemblages

have been shown to be affected by increased UVR and ocean acidification, nothing is known

about how these changes will affect pollutant toxicity (Figure I-1).

Ocean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities – what
we know so far

Effects of ocean acidification in marine microbial communities

Oceanic pH has declined by 0.1 units from pre-industrial times to present (IPCC,

2007). Under unabated CO2 emissions, pH will further decline 0.3 to 0.4 units by the end of

this century, and up to 0.7 units in 2300 (Caldeira et al., 2003). When CO2 dissolves in

seawater, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is formed. It quickly dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H
+) and

a bicarbonate ion (HCO3
-). The hydrogen ion can then react with the carbonate ion (CO2

-3) to

form bicarbonate. This process leads to increased partial pressure (pCO2), increased

concentrations of H2CO3, HCO
-
3, and H

+, and reduced concentrations of CO3
-2 (Fabry et al.,

2008).

The predicted reduction in carbonate ions has led to several studies of marine

organisms such as corals, mollusks, echinoderms and crustaceans, that depend on the

availability of CO3
-2 to form biogenic calcium carbonate to produce shells and skeletons

(Fabry et al., 2008). Similar studies on how functionally important marine microbes will

respond to ocean acidification are, however, lacking.

Recently, Joint et al. (2011) suggested that given that microbial assemblages have

always experienced variable pH conditions, the appropriate null hypothesis to be tested is that

“there will be no catastrophic changes in marine biogeochemical processes driven by

phytoplankton, bacteria and archaea” (Joint et al., 2011). Liu et al. (2010), however, performed

a meta-analysis of published data and suggested that this hypothesis should be rejected (Liu et

al., 2010). Although few and far from consistent, studies on the impacts of ocean acidification

on marine microbial communities include changes to primary production rates, phytoplankton

community structure, the nitrogen cycle and the structure and activity of bacterial

communities (IPCC, 2011).

Most marine primary producers show little or no change in photosynthetic rates when

grown under increased pCO2 (Doney et al., 2009). This appears to be related to the

predominant phytoplankton species. In a mesocosm experiment, a phytoplankton community

dominated by the coccolithophore Emiliana Huxley, increased CO2 uptake by up to 39% under

increased pCO2 levels (Riebesell et al., 2007). The CO2 consumption was not balanced by

increases in particulate organic carbon (POC). Instead, it was rapidly converted to DOC and

TEPs, and any additional carbon incorporation into POC was lost from surface to deep

waters. These results suggest that increased atmospheric pCO2 may lead to increased particle

flux from surface to deep water, potentially providing a negative feedback to increased CO2
emissions (Arrigo, 2007, Riebesell et al., 2007).

Phytoplankton responses to increased pCO2 depend to a large extent, on inorganic

carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) operated by cells (Gattuso et al., 2011). Marine

primary producers include phylogenetically diverse groups that differ in their photosynthetic

apparatus and CCMs. These differences are likely to alter competitive relationships among

phytoplankton and induce shifts in plankton species composition as oceanic pCO2 increases

(Gattuso et al., 2011).

Increased concentrations of CO2 may also affect the nitrogen cycle. The filamentous

cyanobacterium Trichodesmium, a major contributor of new nitrogen in oligotrophic oceans,

increased carbon and nitrogen fixation rates by 35-100% at predicted pCO2 scenarios of the

year 2100 when compared to present day pCO2 conditions (Hutchins et al., 2007). In contrast,

a negative impact of high pCO2 was observed for Nodularia spumigena. These contradictory

results may be related to different ecological strategies of non-heterocystous (Trichodesmium)

and heterocystous (Nodularia) cyanobacteria (Czerny et al., 2009).

In addition to nitrogen fixation, other processes of the nitrogen cycle may be altered

by ocean acidification. It has been suggested that ocean acidification can reduce nitrification

rates by 3-44% within the next few decades (Beman et al., 2010). A few studies have addressed

effects of elevated pCO2 on bacterial abundance and community structure coupled to

phytoplankton dynamics. Abundance of bacteria varied considerably in nitrate and phosphate

induced phytoplankton blooms. However, the effect of CO2 on bacterial abundance could not

be demonstrated (Grossart et al., 2006, Allgaier et al., 2008). The structure of communities of

free living bacteria demonstrated significant changes under increased pCO2, but this effect was

12

not detected in the attached fraction, that correlated more strongly with phytoplankton

development (Allgaier et al., 2008). Increased pCO2 can also affect bacterial extracellular

enzymatic activity and secondary biomass production. Protease activity was reported to be

highest at elevated pCO2 level (Grossart et al., 2006). Piontek et al. (2010) found higher ? and

?-glucosidase in enhanced pCO2 conditions, suggesting that in these circunstances, polymer

hydrolysis may be diverted towards polysaccharide degradation. Polysaccharide-based

dissolved organic matter (DOM) could inhibit the biological carbon pump, resulting in a

positive feedback on CO2 emissions (Piontek et al., 2010). Bacteria production was found to

be higher (Grossart et al., 2006) or unchanged under future pCO2 scenarios (Allgaier et al.,

2008).

In summary, although the underlying mechanisms of increase pCO2 effects are not yet

fully understood, the current knowledge suggests that increased pCO2 levels will affect the

structure of microbial communities and rates of several microbial mediated processes.

Effects of UVR in marine microbial communities

Research on increase UVR implications was stimulated 30 years ago by the realization

that with the stratospheric ozone layer in danger due to anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbons

emissions, there would be an increase in UV-B radiation. Since then, mainly due to the

implementation of the Montreal protocol that successfully reduced ozone-depleting

substances, the ozone levels in the atmosphere are no longer declining (Mckenzie et al., 2011).

However, the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to interact with

ozone and alter its spatial distribution and exchanges between the stratosphere and

troposphere, with potential effects on UVR levels that reach the earth (Bais et al., 2011).

The amount of UVR that reaches the earth surface has direct consequences to aquatic

ecosystems. The UVR component of incident solar radiation is the most photochemically

reactive waveband of incident radiation, being able to penetrate to considerable depths in

aquatic ecosystems, with potential genotoxic, cytotoxic and ontogenetic effects in aquatic

organisms (Bancroft et al., 2007). UVR can be divided in three wavelength ranges: UV-A (320-

400 nm), UV-B (290-320 nm) and UV-C (&lt;290 nm).  Since DNA absorbs only weakly at

longer UV wavelengths (Jones et al., 1987, Wells et al., 1984) the detrimental effects of UV-A

are usually considered to be mostly indirect, resulting from intracellular generation of ROS,

such as oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Pattison et al., 2006). UV-C



Introduction

13

wavelengths are almost completely screened out of the atmosphere by oxygen and ozone,

therefore they are generally not considered as environmentally relevant. UV-B is the highest

energy wavelength of solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface and the UV wavelength

most affected by changes in the ozone layer (Andersen et al., 2002). The UV-B radiation is the

most relevant of the UV spectrum, since it can cause damage to nearly all biomolecules by

direct absorption or indirectly as a result of enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species

(Vincent et al., 2000).

In the natural environment, effects of UV-B radiation are generally attenuated by

protection strategies such as avoidance, photochemical quenching and repair (Vincent et al.,

2000). The overall stress imposed by UVR exposure reflects a balance between damage, repair

and the energetic costs of protection, and may affect energy consumption and biochemical

composition of cellular material, shifting survival and growth rates (Vincent et al., 2000). Due

to short generation times, simple haploid genomes with little or no functional redundancy and

small size, UVR represents an important stressor for microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems

(Garcia-Pichel, 1994). Exposure to UV-B radiation results in a general decrease in bacterial

abundance (Herndl et al., 1993, Santos et al., 2012). Effects of UV-B radiation on bacterial

community composition have been observed, which could have implications to the

biogeochemical impact of enhanced UVR levels on ecosystems. For example, evidences have

been found that Alphaproteobacteria populations sensitive to UVR are responsible for a large

part of low-molecular-weight DOM uptake, while the more UVR-resistant Bacteroidetes, tend to

be specialized in high-molecular-weight DOM uptake (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006, Cottrell et al.,

2000). This suggests that changes in bacterial community due to UVR pressure could lead to

shifts in the pathways of DOM (Morris et al., 2002).

In general, exposure to UV-B also decreases extracellular enzymatic activities (Herndl

et al., 1993, Miiller-niklasl et al., 1995, Santos et al., 2011a), oxygen consumption (Pakulski et al.,

1998), leucine and thymidine incorporation (Sommaruga et al., 1997, Santos et al., 2012), and

induce shifts in carbon source use profiles by bacteria (Santos et al., 2012). This can also affect

DOM utilization in aquatic ecosystems quantitatively and qualitatively. However, results are

sometimes contradictory between studies and vary even between bacterial isolates tested in a

particular study (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006, Santos et al., 2011b). Furthermore, stimulatory

effects of UVR exposure on bacterial activity have also been reported as a result of

phototransformation of organic matter (Pakulski et al., 2007).



Introduction

14

UVR can also affect microorganisms indirectly. Bacteria, viruses, phytoplankton and

bacterivores interact closely, and therefore, if one group of organisms is directly impacted by

UVR (e.g., due to DNA damage) this will indirectly affect carbon flow through the other

groups (Vincent et al., 2000). Effects of UVR on bacteria can also be influenced by the

photochemical alteration of the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The

irradiation of DOC can result in the production of low-molecular weight (LMW) compounds

that are easily taken up by bacteria and used for growth, as well as more refractory products

and ROS which might exert an overall inhibitory effect (Kieber, 2000).

Depending on the environmental properties (physical, chemical and biological) of the

water body studied, UVR can exert a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on bacterial metabolism.

However, most studies agree on the potential of UVR to alter the efficiency with which

dissolved organic matter is transformed into bacterial biomass and thus affect the carbon

cycle.

Interactions between climate change, oil pollution and microbial communities

Despite the fact that several studies have already shown that physical and chemical

parameters directly affect the toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants, the synergistic effects of

UVR and ocean acidification on the chemistry of these pollutants and their effects on marine

microbial communities have received very little attention. Increased levels of UVR and

changes in ocean pH levels will certainly affect the chemical structure of several natural

compounds and environmental pollutants, affecting the way that they interact with marine

organisms.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are, due to their highly conjugated ?-orbital

systems, ideal examples of photoactive contaminants that strongly absorb in the UV-B and

UV-A spectral regions (Krylov et al., 1997). It is known that the toxicity of PAH to marine

organisms increases with exposure to UVR (Krylov et al., 1997, McConkey et al., 1997,

Pelletier et al., 2006, Petersen et al., 2007). This increase is largely regulated by

photosensitization and photooxidation reactions. Photosensitization begins with the

sensitizing molecule absorbing a photon, which elevates it to an excited singlet state. From

there, the molecule can be transformed to the excited triplet state, where it can react with

ground triplet-state oxygen to form singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is capable of oxygenating or

oxidizing a wide range of biomolecules, with potentially lethal effects to a wide range of



Introduction

15

organisms (Krylov et al., 1997). Photomodification (photooxidation) occurs due to the

absorption of photon energy at 280–400 nm (UVR) by the aromatic molecules, which leads to

the formation of new compounds. This process releases phototoxic aromatic hydrocarbons

into the environment, which are more toxic than their parent compounds (Krylov et al., 1997,

McConkey et al., 1997, Peachey, 2005, Sargian et al., 2006, Petersen et al., 2007).

Reduced seawater pH has the potential to affect the adsorption of metals by organic

particles. Generally, organic particles are negatively charged and, as pH declines, surface sites

become less available to adsorb positive charges like metals. This is particularly important

because more than 99% of the total concentrations of many metals in seawater are in organic

complexes (Doney et al., 2009, Millero et al., 2009). A small deviation in the concentration of

elements like Cu and Cd can result in toxic effects to marine organisms (Millero et al., 2009),

including microorganisms. However, organic materials are often nonhomogeneous and have

unknown structures, so the speciation of metals in organic complexes is not as well

characterized as is the case with inorganic ligands (Doney et al., 2009, Millero et al., 2009)

Studies have already found evidences of synergistic interactions between climate

change and anthropogenic pollutants. For example, the exposure to PAH and UVR

treatments independently had no significant effects on larval crab mortality but the combined

exposure caused an increase in mortality of up to 100% when compared to the independent

treatments (Peachey, 2005). Photoenhanced toxicity of PAH due to UVR exposure has been

observed in a variety of organisms, such as algae (Marwood et al., 1999) and crustaceans

(Nikkilä et al., 1999, Peachey, 2005) and plants (Huang et al., 1997). This phenomenon, has

also been reported for isolated bacterial strains such as Photobacterium phosphoreum (McConkey

et al., 1997) and Vibrio fisheri (El-Alawi et al., 2001). However, only few studies have addressed

the effect of UVR photo-modified pollutants in complex microbial assemblages.

In a microcosm experiment designed to study the effects of increased UV-B in the

presence of the water-soluble fraction of crude oil, an increase in mortality was observed in

the phytoplankton community in UV-B exposed microcosm. Bacterial growth was found to

increase, which the authors related with organic matter release due to toxicity effects on

phytoplankton (Pelletier et al., 2006). More recently, a similar effect was observed in sediment

microcosms (Petersen et al., 2008). Algal 14C-incorporation and chlorophyll a content in

sediments exposed to UV-light and pyrene was found to decrease when compared to sole

pyrene treatments. Concurrently, increase O consumption and increase release of N and P was

detected, suggesting an increase in bacterial activity (Petersen et al., 2008). Both of these

studies suggest that PAH phototoxicity may be relevant to microbial communities.

Fabry et al. (2008) suggested that altered water CO2 chemistry in synergy with other

environmental stressors may modify organismal and even ecosystem responses to these

stressors in ways that differ substantially from the action of only a single stressor (Fabry et al.,

2008).  There have, however, been no studies on the toxicity of PAH and other persistent

organic pollutants under increased pCO2 scenarios on marine microorganisms.

An important question that we need to answer thus is whether ocean acidification and

UVR will affect microbial communities in such a way as to alter microbial mediated

detoxification of anthropogenic pollutants. In addition to directly measurable physiological

effects on marine microbes, UVR and ocean acidification can also exert indirect effects on the

toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants by inducing shifts in microbial community structure; they

can also alter microbial mediated detoxification processes. For example, the bioavailability of

inorganic nutrients required for bacterial growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are key

factors in successful ecosystem detoxification of PAH (Atlas et al., 1972). Any factor likely to

alter the nitrogen cycle, such as ocean acidification, has therefore the potential to alter

microbial mediated PAH detoxification processes and consequently PAH toxicity.

Another potential effect of elevated UVR levels and ocean acidification is an alteration

of metal bioavailability. Metals interact with microorganisms in various ways, and are involved

in virtually all aspects of microbial growth and metabolism (Gadd, 2010). Changes in iron

chemistry are particularly important, given that iron is a limiting nutrient for marine

phytoplankton in large oceanic regions (Shi et al., 2010). Although iron is the fourth most

abundant element in the Earth´s crust, it is present in very low concentrations in oceanic

water (Ducklow et al., 2003). This is partially due to the low solubility of Fe (III), the

thermodynamically stable redox form of iron (Sunda, 2010).  Recently, it was reported that the

pCO2 level for the year 2100 would reduce iron uptake by diatoms and coccolithophores by 10

to 20% (Shi et al. 2010). The reduction in iron availability is believed to be related to pH

induced binding of iron to organic ligands, thus reducing biologically available Fe(III) (Sunda,

2010, Shi et al., 2010). However, the net effect of ocean acidification is still unclear. For

example, although lower pH increases iron binding to organic ligands, the solubility of Fe(III)

increases with water acidification (Millero et al., 2009). Moreover, increased organic binding

reduces iron precipitation and adsorption to particulate surfaces, two mechanisms by which

iron is removed from seawater (Sunda, 2010). Lower pH levels will also increase Fe(II)

concentration, due to its ability to form carbonate complexes to a larger degree than the other

free metals and by increasing rates of Fe(III) reduction to soluble Fe(II) (Millero, 2001,

Millero et al., 2009).

Despite the complexity of iron regulation in the ocean, the study by Shi et al. (2010)

highlights potentially harmful effects of iron bioavailability due to ocean acidification. Iron is

also an important factor in the detoxification of hydrocarbons, by influencing the activity of

enzymes that catalyze the oxidative breakdown of PAH (Dinkla et al., 2001, Santos et al.,

2008). Monoxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes, essential in most microbial PAH degradation

pathways, require a metal cofactor which is often iron (Bugg, 2003, Dinkla et al., 2003). The

activity of several key enzymes involved in the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbon

toluene by Pseudomonas putida, including toluene monooxygenase, was found to be reduced

under iron limitation conditions (Dinkla et al., 2001). Furthermore, increasing iron availability

stimulates PAH degradation by increasing the activities of the enzymes involved in the aerobic

degradation, and by increasing PAH bioavailability due to the stimulation of biosurfactant

production (Santos et al., 2008).

Microcosm coupled with molecular biology techniques as a study tool

In order to obtain the information necessary to formulate predictive models of the

combined effects of ocean acidification and UVR on pollutant toxicity and degradation, it is

essential to move forward from a phenomenological approach to a mechanistic view of the

effects of climate change at several scales, ranging from communities to individual organisms

at cellular, genetic and biochemical levels (Reid, 2011). However, anthropogenic

environmental perturbations occur over a very wide range of spatial and temporal scales and

the characterization of cause-effect relationships is difficult to gauge, particularly when

studying additional levels of complexity such as synergistic effects with other stressors. Small

scale models, such as micro- and mesocosms, can provide useful tools to obtain an integrated

view of various phenomena. The distinction between microcosms and mesocosms systems is

somewhat arbitrary. Laboratory small size systems are often referred to as microcosm and

larger 'outdoor' systems are usually referred to as mesocosms.

Microcosms are simplified ecosystems, constructed to mimic natural ecosystems under

controlled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). Their size, design and cost vary with the research

problem to be addressed. They can range from simple flasks and glass containers (Buckling et

al., 2002) to more elaborate controlled environments, such as those developed by Mock and

colleagues to simulate the ice-water interface (Mock et al., 2003). The major advantage of these

experimental setups is that they enable a high degree of experimental control and replication

that are important to our understanding of ecological processes in microbial populations or

communities. The level of experimental control provided by microcosms is virtually

impossible to obtain through field surveys or outdoor mesocosm experimentation (Benton et

al., 2007, Jessup et al., 2004). In addition to this, microcosms permit experimental exposure to

toxic substances that would not be possible in a field setting.

An important, but valid, criticism is that these models are of limited relevance in

understanding large-scale processes, as opposed to field studies (Carpenter et al., 1997). There

is a concern that these models are too small in spatial and temporal scales to be useful.

However, the goal of the microcosm is not to fully reproduce nature in a laboratory model

system, but rather to simplify complex ecosystems (Jessup et al., 2004). Depending on the

research question, laboratory models are not only a valid approach but they can isolate

variables and capture essential dynamics of ecological systems better than field studies

(Cadotte et al., 2005). Although only presenting a limited representation of nature, microcosm

experiments allow the deconstruction of nature to explore hypotheses and test mechanisms

presumed to be operating in field systems (Jessup et al., 2004, Cadotte et al., 2005, Benton et al.,

2007).

Microbial microcosms are particularly interesting since they can overcome scale related

microcosm limitations. The small sizes and short generation times of microorganisms allow

microcosm experiments with a representative range of spatial and temporal scales (Jessup et

al., 2004). Microbial microcosm systems have already allowed the study of ecological processes

including the study of predator-prey coevolution (Jessup et al., 2004), ecosystem level-selection

(Swenson et al., 2000), resource competition (Grover, 2000) and adaptive radiation (Rainey et

al., 1998). Simple microcosms have also been used to study the effect of global change on

microbial communities and simple culture bottles were already used to study the effects of

environmental warming on eukaryotic microbial communities (Petchey et al., 1999).

A major concern in microcosm experiments is whether the structural and functional

properties of the source ecosystem are well represented in the microcosm (Rainey et al., 1998).

Before extrapolating microcosm results to the source ecosystem, ecological parameters must

be compared to determine whether they are within certain limits (Pritchard et al., 1984, Leser,

1994). It is important to underline that laboratory model-systems cannot be the sole focus of

the research. Microcosm studies must be developed along with modeling and they can also be

seen as an important complement to field studies in order to address specific hypotheses

(Benton et al., 2007). Many field studies, for example, only provide correlative evidence of

certain phenomena. For example, the community structure of certain microbial communities

may be significantly related to variation in certain environmental variables (Cleary et al., 2012).

Microcosm experiments can help to elucidate whether there is an actual mechanistic effect of

one or more of these variables on community composition.

Another advantage of using less complex microbial models is that we now have the

tools to characterize the composition and function of microbial communities with

unprecedented resolution. The introduction of high-throughput “omics” technologies in

microbial ecology now allows us to study complex microbial communities at several levels of

biological organization without the need of prior cultivation. First restricted to genomes

(metagenomics), it is now possible to detect RNA transcripts (metatranscriptomics), protein

levels (metaproteomics) and metabolites (metabolomics). We are, however, still far from being

able to use this information to map every biochemical path and trophic interactions so as to

develop descriptive and predictive models (Raes et al., 2008, Jansson et al., 2012). Nevertheless,

these technologies enable a thorough characterization of the structure; function and genetic

potential of microbial communities and under controlled conditions can contribute to the

assessment and monitoring of the effects of global climate changes on key biogeochemical

and ecological processes.

Microcosm experiments paired with new “omics” technologies can provide an

excellent framework to test anthropogenic pollutant toxicity under different climate change

scenarios in marine environments. Such small-scale experiments help to unravel key structural

and functional aspects of environmental microbiology, and may help to test hypotheses that

would be virtually impossible to test in nature. As mentioned previously, microcosms have

already made important contributions to our understanding of microbial ecology. However, in

order to simulate global change scenarios such as those discussed above, with a high degree of

experimental control, more complex microcosm systems are required.

Although there are some major technical challenges that still need to be met with

respect to data acquisition and integration, the ultimate goal must be the development of

integrated approaches that will enable us to test various climate change scenarios and to

ascertain what effect they will have on microbial composition, nutrient cycling and the toxicity

of anthropogenic pollutants.

Abstract: Bacteria that degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the estuarine surface microlayer
(SML) of the Ria de Aveiro, Portugal which is chronically polluted with oil hydrocarbons (OH) were isolated and

characterized; Pseudomonas was dominant among the PAH-degrading bacteria. Screening for PAH dioxygenase

genes detected almost identical nahAc genes (encoding the alpha subunits of naphthalene dioxygenase) in 2

phylogenetically distinct isolates: Pseudomonas sp. and an unknown species of the family Enterobacteriaceae; this

suggested that horizontal transfer of nah genes might be involved in PAH degradation in the SML. We also

investigated the effect of PAH contamination on the spatial variability of the bacterioneuston along a gradient of

pollution in the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro. Culture-independent techniques - fluorescence in situ

hybridization (FISH) and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) - revealed a similar structure among

the bacterioneuston communities along the estuary. In contrast, we detected differences in the relative

abundance and diversity of organisms of the Gammaproteobacteria, including those of the genus Pseudomonas (which

belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria). This is the first insight into the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in

the SML of an estuarine area polluted with hydrocarbons. Our findings highlight the importance of SML-adapted

hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston as a potential source of new PAH-degrading bacteria (including new

pseudomonads) with potential use in the bioremediation of hydrocarbon-polluted ecosystems.

Keywords: Sea surface microlayer, Bacterioneuston, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH

The surface microlayer (SML) is the interface between the atmosphere and the

hydrosphere. This layer is roughly defined as the uppermost millimeter of the water column,

and is characterized as a unique environment with distinct chemical and physical processes

when compared with the underlying water (UW) (Liss et al., 1997, Cunliffe et al., 2009b,

Cunliffe et al., 2011).

The formation of the SML results from the

accumulation of particles at the air–water interface,

establishing a film that extends into the UW

(Cunliffe et al., 2011). Recently, the classical model

of the SML as a stratified structure with an upper

lipid and a lower protein–polysaccharide layer

(Hardy, 1982) has been reviewed. Wurl &amp;amp; Holmes

(2008) reported that the enrichment of transparent

exopolymer particles (TEPs) in the SML at several

locations around Singapore appears to support the

model of the SML first advanced by Sieburth

(1983), i.e. a hydrated gelatinous film (Sieburth,

1983, Wurl et al., 2008, Cunliffe et al., 2009a,

Cunliffe et al., 2011). The organisms within the SML

are known collectively as neuston; the bacterial

fraction of the neuston is the bacterioneuston

(Franklin et al., 2005). The importance of the SML

in the control of environmental processes, and in

the exchange of chemicals between the water and

the atmosphere (Wurl et al., 2004, Obernosterer et

al., 2010, Cunliffe et al., 2009b), has raised interest in

the effects of the activities of the bacterioneuston in

this ecosystem. Cunliffe et al. (2008) found evidence

that the diversity of functional genes encoding

subunits of methane monoxygenase (mmox) and

carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL) is different

in the SML when compared with the UW (Cunliffe

et al., 2008). There is an emerging consensus that

the SML harbors microbial communities distinct

from those in the UW (for a full review see Cunliffe

et al. 2011); however, there is still a lack of

knowledge on both the structure and function of

the SML community. For example, due to the

chemical nature of the SML, natural and anthropogenic aromatic compounds - e.g. polycyclic

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - can be concentrated up to ~500Å in this layer in relation to

the rest of the water column (Wurl et al., 2004). High concentrations of PAHs have been

found in the SML at locations chronically polluted with oil hydrocarbons (OH), such as

shipping harbours (Cincinelli et al., 2001, Wurl et al., 2004). However, so far, no studies have

exploited the potential of microorganisms in the SML to degrade PAHs, or have investigated

the effect of PAHs on the bacterioneuston. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the increased

levels of PAHs in the SML may stimulate the development of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial

populations in this layer. However, studies on the effects of PAH pollution on

bacterioneuston are scarce, and none has specifically addressed the hydrocarbonoclastic

bacterial populations of the SML. In order to obtain more information about the

bacterioneuston, and the potential of these organisms to degrade PAHs, we: (1) isolated and

identified representatives of the hydrocarbonoclastic population in the SML, and (2) screened

the isolates for genes encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of PAHs. We also

evaluated the effect of OH pollution on the spatial variability of the bacterioneuston in a

gradient of contamination in the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro in Portugal.

Materials and Methods

Study site and sampling

Ria de Aveiro is a branched estuarine ecosystem, also described as a coastal lagoon,

located in the northwest coast of Portugal. Samples for the selective isolation of

hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston were obtained from the SML in the middle section of

the estuary, near a shipping harbour. In order to characterize the spatial variation of the

bacterioneuston, 5 collecting points were chosen for sampling. Extending from the outer

segment of the lagoon to the inner section of Canal de Ílhavo, the sites were designated: S1

(40° 40’ 01” N, 08° 49’ 24” W) in the outer section, S2 (40°39 29 N, 08°42 12 W) and S3 (40°

38’ 20” N, 08° 41’ 32” W) in the middle section (near the shipping harbour), and S4 (40° 37’

21” N, 08° 41’ 01” W) and S5 (40° 35’ 41” N, 08° 41’ 21” W) in the inner section of the Canal

de Ílhavo (Figure II-1). Samples were collected from the SML with plexiglass and glass plates.

Both plates were 0.25 m wide, 0.35 m long, and 4 mm thick. Prior to sample collection, the

plates were rinsed with ethanol and sterile distilled water. The plates were introduced vertically



Exploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer

32

through the SML and withdrawn in the same position. Excess water was allowed to drain for

about 5 s. Approximately 5 ml of water were collected each time the plates were introduced

into the SML. The water adhering to the plate was subsequently removed from both sides of

the plate with a wiper blade system (Harvey et al., 1972). The estimated thickness of the

collected SML, determined from the volume of collected sample and the area of both sides of

the plate, was approximately 60 ?m, which is in the range reported by Harvey &amp;amp; Burzell

(1972) for SML glass plate samplers. Salinity was determined immediately after the sampling

with a WTW (Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstätten) Cond330i/SET. Quantification of

PAHs was performed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (gas chromatograph Varian

CP-3800 with split/splitless injection and mass spectrometry detector—Ion Trap Saturn 2200)

with detection limits between 20 and 40 ng l-1. The result was calculated as the average of 2

sub-samples and expressed in ng l-1.

Enrichment and isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria

A PAH, 2-methylnaphthalene, was used as the sole source of carbon and energy for

the enrichment and isolation of PAH-degrading bacteria in a liquid mineral medium (MM).

Selective plates were prepared by adding 2% (wt/vol) agarose to MM. The 2-

methylnaphthalene (Fluka) was added by spreading ethanol solutions (50 mg ml-1) onto the

surface of the solid medium. Inoculation was carried out only when the solvent had fully

evaporated, producing a film of PAH on the surface of the medium (Ma et al., 2006).

Bacterioneuston samples for enrichment cultures were collected near the shipping harbour. A

volume of 200 ml of SML sample was added to 800 ml of sterile MM with 200 mg of 2-

methylnaphthalene (Fluka) in a 1 l sterilized Erlenmeyer flask. The liquid cultures were

incubated at room temperature for 2 weeks, in the absence of light, on a rotary shaker (90

rpm). After the enrichment, 20 ml of culture were transferred to fresh medium and incubated

for the same period of time. After 2 similar subcultures, a serial dilution of the culture was

spread onto the MM selective plates. These cultures were incubated at 25°C for up to 14 d,

protected from light. Individual isolated colonies were further purified by re-streaking onto

new MM selective plates. Control plates without 2-methylnaphthalene were also incubated.

Extraction of DNA

33

Genomic DNA was extracted from all the strains recovered from the isolation

procedure, as previously described by Henriques et al. (2004). Environmental samples were

filtered (pore size: 0.2 ?m; Poretics Products). Total DNA was extracted in 3 replicates and

purified using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (MBI Fermentas) (Henriques et al., 2004).

Molecular characterization and identification of the PAH-degrading bacterial isolates

For molecular typing of the isolates, a repetitive-sequence PCR using a BOX A1R

primer (BOX-PCR fingerprinting) was followed (Rademaker et al., 1998). BOX-PCR profiles

were visualized after separation of PCR amplicons by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel using

1×TAE (Trisacetate-EDTA) at 100 V for 3 h. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide

and digitalized in a Molecular Imager FXTM system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The band

positions were normalized with the GeneRuler™1 kb Plus DNA ladder (75–20 000 bp) and

analysed with GelCompar I software (Applied Maths) using the pairwise Pearson’s product–

moment correlation coefficient (r-value). Cluster analysis of the similarity matrices was

performed by the unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA) using arithmetic averages. For

isolates displaying distinct BOX-PCR profiles, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR

using the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R (Weisburg et al., 1991). PCR products

from the amplified 16S rRNA were used as templates in the sequencing reactions - which

were carried out using an ABI PRISM_BigDye_Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction

Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences were subjected to BLAST (Basic Local Alignment

Search Tool) analysis. These isolates were also screened for the Pseudomonas-specific gacA

gene using primers GACA-1F and GACA-2 (De Souza et al., 2003). All PCR reagents were

purchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise indicated.

Detection of the dioxygenase gene

PCR was used for detecting genes that encode enzymes involved in the aerobic

degradation of PAHs in the isolated strains. Primers specific for the alpha subunit of the

PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenases, common to Gram-negative PAH degraders (PAH-

RHD?GNF and PAH-RHD?GNR primers), were used to obtain amplicons of ca. 306 bp

(Cébron et al., 2008). The PCR products were used as templates in the sequencing reactions.

Sequencing was carried out as described in the previous section, and a comparison was made



Exploring hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the estuarine surface microlayer

34

with sequences available in the GenBank database by using the BLAST service to determine

their closest relative. All PCR reagents were purchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise

indicated.

Microbial community structure

Denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE): DGGE was performed on the

Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene sequence amplified from bacterial isolates and from

environmental samples. This technique was also applied to the 16S rRNA gene sequence

amplified from environmental samples. A nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S

rRNA gene fragments for DGGE analyses. For the first PCR, the universal bacterial primers

U27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Weisburg et al.,

1991). The amount of template DNA used per reaction was ca. 10 ng. For the second PCR, 1

?l of the product of the first PCR was used as template with bacterial DGGE primers 968F-

GC and 1401R (ca. 433 bp) (Nübel et al., 1996). A nested-PCR approach was also applied to

the amplification of Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene fragments for DGGE analysis (Costa et al.,

2007). For the first PCR, primers GACA-1F and GACA-2 were used to amplify ca. 425 bp of

the gacA gene (De Souza et al., 2003). The amount of template DNA used per reaction was ca.

10 ng. An aliquot of 1 ?l of the product of the first PCR was used as the template for a

second PCR with primers gacA1F-GC and gacA2R (Costa et al., 2007). All PCR reagents were

purchased from MBI Fermentas unless otherwise indicated. DGGE analysis was performed

with a CBS-DGGE 2401 system (CBS Scientific). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied to

a double-gradient polyacryl-amide gel containing 6 to 9% acrylamide (Rotiphorese) with a

gradient of 30 to 58% of denaturant. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer

(0.5 M Tris-Base, Sigma, 0.05 M EDTA, Sigma; 0.1 M CH3CO2Na, Sigma, pH 8.0) at 60°C at

a constant voltage of 220 V for 16 h. The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001).

The Shannon index of diversity (H) was used to compare the complexity of the DGGE

profiles. The band position and relative intensity (abundance) of each lane (community) were

used as parameters to indicate categories (Costa et al., 2006). Parametric analysis of variance

(Anova) was applied to assess significant differences between samples, provided that data

were normally distributed. The relative abundance of members of the domain Bacteria and the

Gammaproteobacteria in the SML was assessed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

(Pernthaler et al., 2001) using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes (MWG Biotech). Triplicate

samples (1 ml) were filtered through polycarbonate filters (pore size: 0.2 ?m; GE Osmonics),

fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and rinsed with 1×PBS and MilliQ water. The

filters were stored at room temperature until hybridization. The probes used in this study were

EUB338 for the domain Bacteria (Amann et al., 1990) and EUB338-II and EUB338-III to

cover the phyla Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia (Daims et al., 1999). For the

Gammaproteobacteria we used the probes GAM42a (Manz et al., 1992) and an unlabeled

competitor probe specific for the Betaproteobacteria. A non-binding probe was also used as a

control for nonspecific binding (Karner et al., 1997). Samples were examined with a Leitz

Laborlux K microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets for fluorescence from 4,6-

diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and CY3. At least 10 fields were counted per replicate of

sample. In addition to the relative abundance of organisms of the domain Bacteria and of the

Gammaproteobacteria, it was also possible to obtain a measure of total microorganisms with the

DAPI counts. All reagents were purchased from Fluka, except when otherwise indicated.

Total microorganisms (DAPI counts) were tested for normality (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test)

before the comparison of means. Parametric Anova was performed, provided that data were

normally distributed.

Results and discussion

Physical and chemical parameters

Salinity in the analyzed SML samples ranged between 31.4% (Stn S5) and 36.0% (Stn

S1). Salinity is an important factor that influences the structure and composition of

prokaryotic assemblages in estuarine environments (Bouvier et al., 2002, Henriques et al.,

2004). However, in this study, the variation of salinity along the estuarine profile was very

small, and did not seem to influence the distribution of bacterial communities. The PAH

analyses revealed that the composition and concentration of PAHs varied along the estuary

(Table II-1). Concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection of the method to 14 ±

5 ng l-1 of naphthalene. Stn S1 showed the lowest concentration of PAH (anthracene: 7.3 ±

0.2 ng l-1). In Stns S2 and S3, located near the shipping harbour, naphthalene reached the

highest concentrations (S2: 14 ± 5 ng l-1; S3: 9.4 ± 1.5 ng l-1). Naphthalene is the simplest of

the oil PAH compounds; it is the most easily degradable and is highly volatile (Sporstol et al.

1983). The 3-ring PAH compounds anthracene (6.9 ± 0.2 ng l-1) and phenanthrene (8.1 ± 1.7

ng l-1) were detected at the Stns S2 and S3, respectively. At Stn S4, fluorene (9.4 ± 1.5 ng l -1)

was the only PAH detected. Stn S5 showed the largest spectrum of PAH compounds

(phenanthrene 5.2 ± 0.1 ng l-1, fluoranthrene 8.5 ± 1.1 ng l-1, benzo[a]anthracene 5.1 ± 0.8 ng

l-1 and benzo[k]fluoranthene 8.1 ± 0.6 ng l-1).

PAH-degrading isolates: characterization of isolates

In order to isolate organisms from hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston populations,

in the first phase of this study, our sampling efforts were focused on the region of the Ria de

Aveiro near the harbour facilities (see Figure II-1, Stns S2 and S3). This area showed the

highest levels of contamination by low-molecular-weight PAHs. These PAHs constitute a

significant fraction of crude oil and petroleum products and are often used as indicators of

recent or chronic contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons (Sporstol et al., 1983). The

PAH 2-methylnaphthalene, a common constituent of crude oil and fossil fuels, was used in

this study as the sole source of carbon and energy for the enrichment and isolation of strains

37

of the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston (Kasai et al., 2002). The isolation procedure

recovered 42 bacterial isolates that were able to use 2-methylnaphthalene as the sole source of

carbon. Genotypic diversity of the isolates, assessed by the whole-genome BOX-PCR

fingerprint method (Rademaker et al., 1998), assigned the isolates to 29 different genotypes.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that all hydrocarbonoclastic isolates were

Gram-negative and had high homology with 6 different taxa: Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia,

Acinetobacter, Rhizobium and Vibrio (Table II-2).

Pseudomonas and Klebsiella were preponderant, accounting to 34.5 and 31.0%,

respectively, of the total representative isolates (10 isolates were assigned to the genus

Pseudomonas and 9 to Klebsiella). These results point to a high genotypic diversity in the

populations of hydrocarbonoclastic Pseudomonas in the SML (Table II-2). Members of this

genus have a remarkable ability to degrade a wide range of organic pollutants, including PAHs,

halogenated derivates and recalcitrant organic residues (Johnsen et al., 1996, Bhattacharya et al.,

2003). Besides their capacity to degrade toxic compounds, species such as P. putida can

efficiently produce a range of valuable compounds with industrial uses (Wackett, 2003). These

abilities, together with enhanced stress resistance, amenability to genetic manipulation and

suitability as a host for heterologous expression, makes strains of Pseudomonas particularly

useful for biotechnological applications (Pucha?ka et al., 2008). As well as contamination with

PAHs, the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro is also subject to chronic contamination with

domestic sewage (Cunha et al., 2000). This might explain the large number of isolates related

to the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella and Serratia. Nonetheless, the catabolic capacity

of Klebsiella strains to degrade hydrocarbons, including PAHs, has been previously described.

A recent study suggested that Klebsiella can be an important part of the OH-degrading bacterial

groups in estuarine areas exposed to sewage contamination (Rodrigues et al., 2009).

Acinetobacter and Rhizobium were also part of the culturable fraction of PAH degraders in the

SML. Many environmental strains of Acinetobacter with hydrocarbon-degrading capacities have

been isolated in terrestrial and marine environments (Vanbroekhoven et al., 2004, Rodrigues et

al., 2009). Reports of the presence of Rhizobium in PAH-contaminated soils, and its

hydrocarbon-degrading metabolism, are also available (Poonthrigpun et al., 2006). One of the

isolates was identified as Vibrio, which has also been reported as a PAH degrader in marine

environments (Hedlund et al., 2001).

PAH-degrading isolates: detection of dioxygenase genes

In the present study, an attempt was made to detect genes encoding the enzyme

system PAH-RHD? (involved in the initial step in bacterial metabolism of PAH) in the

bacterioneuston isolates. All isolates, including those having similar BOX-PCR profiles, were

screened. Although the isolates were cultivated with 2-methylnaphthalene as the sole source of

carbon, and reference to the PAH-degrading capacity was obtained from the literature for all

the identified genera (Hedlund et al., 2001, Vanbroekhoven et al., 2004, Ma et al., 2006,

Poonthrigpun et al., 2006, Rodrigues et al., 2009), PAH-RHD? gene sequences were detected

in only 2 of the isolates.

A positive PCR amplification product was obtained only for isolates #10 (Pseudomonas sp.) and

#25, an unknown member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, the lack of amplification

does not exclude the presence of dioxygenases in the other isolates; instead, this result may

indicate the presence of novel genes encoding PAH-degrading enzymes in these

hydrocarbonoclastic organisms. Moreover, because we did not monitor the complete cleavage

of the benzene rings in this study, it cannot be excluded that the isolated strains oxidize only

the methyl group of 2-methylnaphtalene. It is possible that the ndo-negative isolates use the

methyl group as a source of carbon and energy without cleaving the benzene ring.

Phylogenetic analysis, by BLAST, of our PAH-RHD? gene sequences and their closest

relatives showed that both PAH-RHD? genes clustered together with the archetypal nahAc

gene carried by the plasmid pNAH20 (Yen et al., 1982, Eeva et al., 2000, Sota et al., 2006)

(Figure II-2). As identical PAH-RHD? genes with high homology to those in naphthalene-

degrading plasmids occur in different bacterial families, it is reasonable to speculate that

horizontal gene transfer may also play a role in the occurrence and spreading of

hydrocarbonoclastic capacity in the SML. Horizontal exchange of genes encoding the

degradation of xenobiotic compounds is a common phenomenon in biofilms (Singh et al.,

2006). A preponderance of biofilm growing cells in the SML could favor ecological processes

that occur in communities with cells in close proximity, such as gene transfer and quorum

sensing (Cunliffe et al., 2009b).

method and bootstrapping analysis (1000 repetitions). The numbers on the branches indicate percentages of

bootstrap values. The scale bar represents the percentage of amino acid divergence.

The effect of sampling site on the community structure of the bacterioneuston

Whole-community and Pseudomonas structural diversity

Because most microorganisms are refractory to cultivation, culture-independent

methods are fundamental in the characterization of the structure of microbial communities in

the environment (Amann et al., 1995). DGGE was used to assess the structural diversity of the

overall bacterial community. The banding pattern analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA

gene showed a large number of equally abundant bands in bacterioneuston communities from

all the sampling sites (Figure II-3). The Shannon diversity index revealed no significant

differences between sites (Table II-3). This analysis suggests that the dominant bacterial

communities are very similar in the SML of different sampling sites. Earlier studies, using

DGGE, found that the dominant bacterioneuston communities were similar in 2 different

areas of the Blyth estuary (Cunliffe et al., 2008). Recently, this author also reported that

bacterioneuston communities from 2 different areas, close to the Hawaiian Island of Oahu,

were more similar to each other than to their subjacent bacterioplankton communities

(Cunliffe et al., 2009a).

Due to the preponderance of Pseudomonas among the bacteria isolated from the PAH-

enrichment culture, and because of the recognized ability of the organisms of this genus to

degrade PAHs, we paid particular attention to the diversity of a Pseudomonas genetic marker in

the SML at all sites. The Pseudomonas-specific gacA gene was used as a genetic marker for this

genus. This gene influences the production of several secondary metabolites in Pseudomonas

spp., and it can be used as a complementary genetic marker for detecting bacteria of this genus

in environmental samples (De Souza et al., 2003).

Interestingly, contrary to what was observed for the bacterial fingerprints, analysis of

the Pseudomonas community showed a significant (Anova, P&amp;lt;0.05) increase in diversity (Table

II-3) from the outer (Stn S1) to the middle (Stn S3) and inner (Stn S5) sections of the estuary,

following the concentrations of PAH and organic matter. This pattern may explain the high

abundance of Pseudomonas strains recovered from the SML-PAH enrichments obtained in the

area with higher levels of lighter (low-molecular-weight) PAHs. As previously mentioned,

members of this genus are known for their ability to metabolize light PAH compounds and

other monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The gacA DGGE pattern of the isolated strains, and the

gacA profile of whole bacterioneuston, showed a common band with the mobility exhibited by

isolate #27 (Figure II-4). This band is present in the bacterioneuston from Stns S1, S2 and S3,

but is absent in samples from Stns S4 and S5, at the inner section of the estuary. Interestingly,

isolate #27 showed a high homology with an uncultured Pseudomonas which has been linked to

the transformation of organic compounds in coastal seawater (Xiaozhen et al., 2007). These

results suggest that the distribution of Pseudomonas populations may also be related to the

quality and composition of lipophilic organic compounds in the SML.

Microbial abundance overall and in the Gammaproteobacteria

FISH was applied in this study to assess the spatial variability in the total abundance of

microorganisms and also for quantifying members of the domain Bacteria and the

Gammaproteobacteria in the SML (Amann et al., 1990, Manz et al., 1992, Karner et al., 1997,

Daims et al., 1999, Pernthaler et al., 2001). The overall abundance of microorganisms estimated

from DAPI counts ranged from 2.3 ± 0.2 × 106cells ml-1 at Stn S1, to 5.0 ± 0.9 × 106 cells ml-1

at Stn S5, defining a significant (Anova, P &amp;lt;0.05) gradient of enrichment from the outer to

the inner sections of the estuary (Figure II-5). The total cell number is within the range

(4.9×105 cells ml-1 to 6.2 × 106 cells ml-1) observed in the Ria de Vigo, Spain, estuary

(Zdanowski et al., 1997). The pattern of variation that we detected corresponds, in general, to

the structure of an estuary in which bacterial abundance and phytoplankton biomass are

maximal at the intermediate sections (Wright et al., 1983, Fuks et al., 1991, Cunha et al., 2003).

This distribution is probably related to the quality (lability) of the available organic matter

along the estuary. The relative abundance of organisms of the domain Bacteria varied between

50.4 ± 3.6% at Stn S2 and 66.7 ± 9.2% at Stn S4 (Figure II-5).

The proportion of cells hybridized by the Bacteria probes is within the 60% average

reported for the Delaware estuary (Kirchman et al., 2005). The missing percentage could be

related to other groups not covered by this study. Results of a CARD-FISH analysis, revealed

that up to 37% of the total cell numbers recovered from the SML in high mountain lakes

hybridized with Archaea-specific probes (Auguet et al., 2008). The relative abundance of

organisms of the domain Bacteria did not show a defined trend of spatial variation along the

estuary. On the contrary, the highest value for the relative abundance of organisms of the

Gammaproteobacteria (19.7 ± 1.0%) was found in the SML at Stn S3 (Figure II-5), where

naphthalene and phenantrene were detected. Gammaproteobacteria were selected as a target for

FISH analysis because this group includes many of the PAH-degrading genera, such as

Alcanivorax, Cycloclasticus, Pseudomonas, Oleiphilus, Oleispira and Thalassolituus (Watanabe, 2001,

Head et al., 2006). Although the abundance and distribution of microorganisms in marine and

estuarine waters is influenced by complex biotic and abiotic interactions (Shiah et al., 1995),

the high concentration of low-molecular-weight PAHs, generally easily degraded (Yamada et

al., 2003), at sampling Stn S3 can be related to the high relative abundance of

Gammaproteobacteria at this site. Exposure to hydrocarbons has been shown to decrease

bacterial diversity, as a result of selection in favor of PAH-degrading bacteria (Roling et al.,

2002, Castle et al., 2006). Nonetheless, other sources of organic carbon might also have

influenced the distribution of this group. The preference of Gammaproteobacteria for high

concentrations of nutrients has been previously reported, and peaks of abundance appeared to

be related to particular point sources of nutrients (Bouvier et al., 2002, Henriques et al., 2004).

Conclusions

To our knowledge, we are the first to have isolated and characterized

hydrocarbonoclastic strains of bacterioneuston from estuarine SML exposed to chronic OH

contamination; the most dominant isolates belonged to the genus Pseudomonas (members of

the Gammaproteobacteria). The SML is the first marine habitat to be in contact with hydrophobic

OH pollutants after an oil spill accident. The possibility of using hydrocarbonoclastic

bacterioneuston isolates in a bioremediation strategy for the rapid degradation of oil slicks

should be examined in future studies. The SML has the potential to be a natural ‘seed bank’

that can be useful for isolating and ‘domesticating’ novel bacteria for PAH degradation. The

ability of the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston to withstand and degrade toxic

compounds, together with its capacity to survive in this environment, make the isolates

recovered in this study interesting candidates for future research on in situ SML

bioremediation.

The cultivation-independent analyses (FISH counts and Pseudomonas-DGGE) agreed

with the isolation results. These findings indicate that the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria

and the diversity of Pseudomonas in the bacterioneuston have undergone significant changes in

areas contaminated with elevated levels of OH in the Ria de Aveiro. However, the ecological

role of the bacterioneuston in the degradation of hydrophobic OH pollutants is still unclear.

Future work should focus on more in-depth functional analyses of genes whose

expression/repression are most likely related to SML contamination by OH compounds.

Global Change Biology (2013)

Abstract: An experimental life support system (ELSS) was constructed to study the interactive effects of
multiple stressors on coastal and estuarine benthic communities, specifically perturbations driven by global

climate change and anthropogenic environmental contamination. The ELSS enables the control of salinity, pH,

temperature, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), tidal rhythms and exposure to selected contaminants. Unlike most

microcosms previously described, the ELSS enables true independent replication (including randomisation). In

addition to this, it can be assembled using commercially available materials and equipment, thereby facilitating

the replication of identical experimental setups in different geographical locations. The present study aimed the

validation of the reproducibility and environmental quality of the system by comparing chemical and biological

parameters recorded in our ELSS with those prevalent in the natural environment. Water, sediment microbial

community and ragworm (the polychaete Hediste diversicolor) samples were obtained from four microcosms after

57 days of operation. In general, average concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3-; NH4+ and PO4 3-

) in the water-column of the ELSS experimental control units were within the range of concentrations recorded

in the natural environment. While some shifts in bacterial community composition were observed between in situ

and ELSS sediment samples, the relative abundance of most metabolically active bacterial taxa appeared to be

stable. In addition, ELSS operation did not significantly affect survival, oxidative stress and neurological

biomarkers of the model organism H. diversicolor. The validation data indicates that this system can be used to

assess independent or interactive effects of climate change and environmental contamination on benthic

communities. Researchers will be able to simulate the effects of these stressors on processes driven by microbial

communities, sediment and seawater chemistry and to evaluate potential consequences to sediment toxicity using

model organisms such as Hediste diversicolor.

Introduction

One of the greatest scientific challenges currently faced by researchers worldwide is to

understand how human activities alter ecosystems and how ecosystems will respond to future

perturbations. A key question is to what extent changes in ocean temperature, acidity and UV

radiation will affect contaminant toxicity and what impact this will have on the marine biota

(Doney, 2010, Hader et al., 2011). Although there is an increased awareness of the potential

for interactions between climate change and chemical contaminants, we only have a

rudimentary understanding of how multiple stressors interact to affect (communities of)

organisms (Schiedek et al., 2007, Gao et al., 2012, Passow et al., 2012). Thus, it is important that

we gain a mechanistic understanding of how anthropogenic stressors affect coastal and

estuarine marine ecosystems. These biomes provide valuable ecosystem services such as

fisheries, filtering, detoxification and carbon sequestration. However, they are among the most

impacted of global ecosystems (Barbier et al., 2010).

The processes involved in ecosystem response to perturbation often occur over a wide

range of temporal and spatial scales with unknown interactions, making it difficult to establish

cause-effect relationships in natural systems (Benton et al., 2007). In particular, there is no

standardized approach for the evaluation of global change effects on different marine

ecosystems. Small scale models, e.g. microcosms, can be a useful tool to assess such complex

global problems (Benton et al., 2007). Microcosms are simplified ecosystems, designed to

simulate natural environments under controlled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). These

model systems allow the testing of hypotheses and ecological theories on populations or

communities with a high degree of experimental control and replication, which would be very

difficult to achieve through field observation or in situ experimentation (Benton et al., 2007,

Jessup et al., 2004). Moreover, microcosms enable researchers to perform experiments with

potentially toxic contaminants, which would rarely (if ever) be carried out in the field.

In the present study, we assessed the extent to which microcosm conditions affect the

sediment bacterial communities and the endobenthic species Hediste diversicolor (Mu ?ller, 1776,

formerly known as Nereis diversicolor). Bacterial communities are fundamental players in all

relevant geochemical cycle. However, despite the overwhelming importance of bacterial

mediated processes, the potential impact of climate change on the composition and activity of

bacterial assemblages is still poorly understood (Reid, 2011). Hediste diversicolor is a key species

in shallow coastal systems: it is omnivorous, an active predator, and is highly prone to



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

55

predation by waders, fish and crabs (Scaps, 2002). This species has been widely used as a

model or sentinel organism in the assessment of sub-lethal impact of contaminant in estuaries,

both in the field and laboratory microcosms (Moreira et al., 2006).

An important, but often overlooked, prerequisite for performing microcosm

experiments is to determine whether the structural and functional properties of the source

ecosystem are well represented in the microcosm, and the extent to which the experimental

results are biased by the microcosm design and conditions (Leser, 1994). In the present study

our main goals were to develop and evaluate an innovative experimental life support system

(ELSS) designed to: 1) study the interactive effects of multiple stressors on coastal and

estuarine benthic communities, i.e., environmental stressors resulting from climate change and

contamination; and 2) enable researchers to carry out complex but well replicated

experiments. We also aimed to develop a versatile system that could be assembled in different

marine regions across the world using commercially available materials and equipment. The

physical, chemical and biological parameters of marine environments can be highly variable at

the regional scale. This variability determines, to a given extent, how intensively global climate

change affects these environments. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to evaluate the

applicability of current models in predicting changes in local ecosystem health and function.

Methods

ELSS basic architecture

The basic concept of our ELSS was to provide a versatile framework for microcosm

simulation of climate change scenarios in coastal and estuarine environments that could be

easily replicated around the world. To achieve this goal, the system was developed using: 1)

affordable materials and equipment, which are readily available in local or online stores (Table

III-S1 for a list of the main material and equipment employed to assemble the ELSS, as well

as their respective suppliers), and 2) a modular construction system that will enable

researchers to work over a wide range of configurations, thus allowing them to address

specific research questions using statistically robust experimental designs.

The ELSS mimics fundamental aspects that condition biological activity in marine

ecosystems, namely photoperiod, light intensity (including photosynthetically active radiation,

PAR) and tidal cycles. Additionally, it is possible to control temperature, ultraviolet radiation

(UVR), salinity and pH. The ELSS is composed by two frames of 16 microcosms (32 in total)

(glass tanks 25 cm high, 28 cm length and 12.4 cm width, each with a maximum functional

water volume of approximately 3 L), which makes it possible to run up to 8 treatments

simultaneously, each one with a maximum of 4 independent replicates for each treatment. All

replicates can be arranged in a randomized split-plot design (Figure III-1 and Figure S III-1).

Tidal cycle and water circulation control system

The ELSS is operated using synthetic saltwater, which is prepared by mixing

freshwater, purified by a four stage reverse osmosis unit (Aqua-win RO-6080) with a

commercially available salt mixture (Tropic Marin Pro Reef salt – Tropic Marine, Germany)

(Figure III-1, B1 and B2). The water for tidal cycles is prepared 24 h before use, in order to

allow salt and water to mix. No water recirculation is employed in order to avoid cross

contamination between experimental treatments and to avoid chemical artefacts that may be

promoted by re-using the same water over time. Thus, the ELSS can be described as a flow-

through non-recirculated system operated with synthetic saltwater. Its hydraulic system

enables microcosms to be operated under any desired tidal regime (e.g., diurnal, mixed, semi-

diurnal). Each tidal regime is controlled as follows: newly prepared synthetic saltwater is

pumped (Aquabee UP 3000) into the saltwater reservoirs (Figure III-1, C and D) for pH

adjustment (if necessary); the ELSS is equipped with 4 such reservoirs (each with an

approximate volume of 230 L). For high tide events, saltwater is pumped using a submersible

pump (Aquabee UP 3000) from reservoirs C and D (Figure III-1) through an independent

pipe system of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes into each microcosm. The saltwater flow rate is

manually controlled by a PVC valve located above each microcosm (Figure S III-1, S III-2 and

S III-3). Low tide events are simulated using outflow submersible pumps (Rena flow 400 C),

operated with digital timers; each glass tank (the microcosm) is equipped with a single pump

positioned inside a PVC cylinder and protected with a mesh screen (to avoid clogging) (Figure

S III-4). During low tide events the water is discharged from the microcosms through an

outflow pipe, and drained to a collector.

pH control system

Water pH can be manipulated by acidifying the water stocked in the tide reservoirs by

bubbling CO2 through a diffuser (Figure S III-5) (Gattuso et al., 2009). The diffuser operates

with a water pump (Aquabee UP 3000) to maximize CO2 gas mixing in saltwater. CO2
addition is controlled with a feedback system that includes a combination of a pH electrode

connected to a controller (V² control pH controller, Tropical Marine Centre, UK) and a

pressure regulator with an integrated solenoid valve (V² pressure regulator pro, Tropical

Marine Centre, UK). The digital display of the controller allows visualization of actual pH in

the saltwater reservoirs and pH monitoring with the pH electrode. The controller opens the

solenoid valve whenever pH rises above the set value; CO2 is then injected until water pH

returns to the pre-set value. We tested the pH system under the experimental validation

parameters to simulate a pH reduction of 0.3 units. The average pH value measured in low

tide every two days along a week, (Figure SIII-10), was 7.67± 0.07 (NBS scale).

Temperature control system

In order to compensate for potential temperature fluctuations during experimental

trials, namely those promoted by the illumination system implemented in our ELSS (see

below), about two thirds of the microcosms height was immersed in one of two main water

tanks (Figure III-1, E1 and E2). These water bath tanks are perforated at the bottom and

connected through a 40 mm PVC pipe with a valve. The connection between water bath tanks

ensures that temperature is the same in all microcosms. For conducting experiments with

different temperatures the connection valve between the water bath tanks can be closed,

allowing the setting of two distinct water temperature treatments. The water in the tanks is

continuously pumped by a canister filter pump (SunSun HW-302) through a cooler equipped

with a thermostat (Teco TR10) set to the desired temperature. The canister filter pump

(composed by mechanical filtration sponges and activated carbon to remove any debris from

the freshwater in the bath) operates with a flow rate of 1000 L h-1 (Figure S III-6). Four

submersible 200 W heaters equipped with thermostats (Rena Cal 200) are placed inside the

water bath tanks to modify water temperature to previously set values. The simultaneous

operation of the cooling and heating system minimises water temperature fluctuations to ±

0.5ºC.

Lighting control system

The ELSS is equipped with 4 ReefSET® programmable luminaire systems for diurnal

light cycle and controlled UV simulation. Each luminaire holds 4 UV fluorescent tubes

(SolarRaptor, T5/54W, Germany) and 4 full spectra fluorescent tubes (AquaLight,

T5/54W/10000K,Germany) disposed alternately under a reflector (Figures S III-7 and S III-

8). The luminaire system incorporates a dimming ballast that allows the adjustment of light

intensity by varying the voltage supply. ReefSET® proprietary software enables the simulation

59

of a range of scenarios by varying the percentage of light intensity (see

http://www.reefset.com).

Water chemistry analysis

Water samples for dissolved inorganic nutrient (nitrate NO3
-, ammonium NH4

+ and o-

phosphate PO4
3-) determination were collected from each microcosm at the beginning of the

experiment, after 21 days and at the end of the experiment. Water aliquots were immediately

filtered (Whatman GF/C glass-fibre filter) and stored frozen at -20 ºC until analysis. NO3
-

determination followed the 8039 method described in the Hach Spectrophotometer (DR

2000) standard analytical procedures (Hach, USA, DR2000, 44863-00). The determination of

NH4
+ and PO4

3- concentrations were carried out following standard spectrophotometric

methods described elsewhere (LimnologiskMetodik, 1992). The analytical quality control was

ensured by duplicate samples and by the analysis of blanks between samples.

Visual inspection of NO3
-, NH4

+ and PO4
3- histograms revealed significant deviations from

normal distributions. The distributions remained significantly deviant after logarithmic and

square-root transformation. We, therefore, tested for significant differences in dissolved

inorganic nutrient concentration among sampling events using a repeated measures

permutational analysis of variance with the adonis() function (Vegan package) in R

(http://www.r-project.org/; Accessed 4 May 2012). The script used is provided in the

supporting information.

Biological validation

Sediment sampling

Four sediment cores were collected at the east margin of Mira channel (40°37"N,

8°44"W), one of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal) in May 2011. The

Ria de Aveiro is a shallow mesotidal coastal lagoon connected with the Atlantic Ocean

through a single inlet, and characterized by four main channels with several secondary narrow

channels, inner basins and extensive intertidal areas (Dias et al., 2001). Several studies have

shown that Ria de Aveiro has a moderate level of eutrophication and low overall human

influence when compared to other estuarine systems (Ferreira et al., 2003, Lopes et al., 2007).



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

60

Plexiglass cores of undisturbed sediment samples (10 cm deep, 27 cm length and 10.6 cm

width) were collected and each core transferred directly into individual microcosms (4 in total)

of the ELSS (Figure III-1, A) in May 2011. Microcosms containing the sediment were brought

back to the laboratory and connected to the ELSS less than 2 h after sampling. The ELSS was

operated continuously during 57 days.

Experimental validation parameters

The ELSS system was programmed to simulate the specific seasonal characteristics of

the coastal lagoon system (Ria de Aveiro) at the sampling site where and when sediment cores

were collected. Salinity was adjusted to simulate the conditions recorded at the sampling

location and kept constant (32.6 ± 1.5) during the experiment, with synthetic saltwater being

prepared as described above in the “tidal cycle and water circulation control system” section.

Prior to each high tide, water salinity was checked. All microcosms were exposed to a uniform

semi-diurnal tidal regime, experiencing two high tides and two low tides daily. Each tidal cycle

took approximately 1 min. The duration of each tidal event minimizes pH and salinity

fluctuations between the reservoirs and the microcosms. The minimum and maximum water

levels above the sediment surface were approximately 5 cm (low tide) and 10 cm (high tide).

During each tidal cycle about 50% of the water volume of each microcosm was exchanged

(~1.5 L), thus simulating the water renewal percentage recorded for the central area of the

estuarine system recreated in the ELSS (Ria de Aveiro) (Dias et al., 2001).

Water pH was adjusted to 8.0 and water temperature to 19ºC, which corresponds to

the average values recorded at the sampling location. The average pH monitored in the system

was 7.97± 0.07 (NBS scale). With the luminaires system set to its maximum power, the PAR

value measured for the full spectrum fluorescent lamps was 260.50 ± 56.30 ?mol photons m-2

s-1, and the UV-A (320-400 nm) irradiance emitted by the UV lamps was 2875.91 ± 264.62

mW m-2 (Lamp spectrum - Figure III-S9, and measurement details can be consulted in

supporting information). In order to mimic summer photoperiod and light conditions at

Portuguese latitudes during the time of sampling, a 14 hour diurnal light cycle was simulated,

with light intensity varying from 50% to 100% of the total fluorescent tube intensity (Table II-

S2). Since UV-A radiation is practically unaffected by changes in ozone depletion and plays an

important role in biological systems, including photo-repair mechanisms (Bargagli, 2005), a

similar amount of UV-A integrated irradiance was maintained constant among microcosms.



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

61

This was achieved by activating the UV lamps for four h a day at maximum intensity and

filtering the UV-B component with a glass panel in the luminaires.

Profiling of the active bacterial community

RNA extraction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing

Four composite samples each corresponding to four sediment cores (~1 cm of top

sediment with a 1 cm diameter) were obtained in situ (ConBs), and from the microcosm after

21 days (ConIs) and 57 days (ConFs) of operation. Environmental samples were collected at

the study site, separated from each other by at least 1 m. Microcosm samples were obtained

from four independent microcosms. Approximately 1 g of the aerobic sediment layer was

directly transferred into a 2.0 ml screw cap tube containing Lysing Matrix E (FastRNA® Pro

Soil-Direct Kit, Qbiogene Inc.,CA) and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen (Liu et al.,

2011). Samples were kept at -80º C until RNA extraction.

Total RNA was isolated from sediment samples using the FastPrep® Instrument

(Qbiogene, Inc, CA), for 40 s at a speed setting of 6.0 according to the manufacturer's

instructions. Residual DNA was removed using Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems,

Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was then converted to single stranded cDNA using random

hexamer-primed reverse transcription by applying SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase Kit

(Invitrogen). The complete removal of DNA was confirmed by PCR. Universal bacterial

primers U27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA cDNA (Weisburg

et al., 1991). Specific products were detected in cDNA samples after reverse transcription, but

not in their corresponding source RNA samples (data not shown).

Denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to monitor structural

variation in bacterial communities in ConBs, ConIs and ConFs. Briefly, a nested PCR

approach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequence from the samples. For the first

PCR, the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R were used. For the second PCR, 1 ?l of

the product of the first PCR was used as template with bacterial DGGE primers 968F-GC

and 1401R (ca. 433 bp) (Nübel et al. 1996). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied to a

double-gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6 to 10% acrylamide (Rotiphorese) with a

gradient of 40 to 58% of denaturants. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer

(0.5 M Tris-Base, Sigma, 0.05 M EDTA, Sigma; 0.1 M CH3CO2Na, Sigma, pH 8.0) at 60 °C at



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

62

a constant voltage of 220 V for 16 h on a DCode vertical electrophoresis apparatus (universal

mutation detection system; Bio-Rad). The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001).

The processing of the DGGE gels was carried out using the Bionumerics software 6.6

(Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for an in

depth microbial community analysis of ConBs and ConFs samples. Fragments of the 16S

rRNA (cDNA) were sequenced for each sample with primers V3 Forward (5´ -

ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3’) and V4 Reverse (5´ - TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3’)

using the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Life Sciences Roche Diagnostics Ltd, West

Sussex, UK). Sequences were analysed with QIIME software package following published

recommendations (Kuczynski et al., 2011). Details on sequence quality analysis and assignment

can be found in supporting information. Sequences can be downloaded from the NCBI Short

Read Archive (STUDY SRP013200).

Two square matrices 1. containing the abundance of all OTUs per sample generated

with Qiime and 2. containing band 'abundance' based on band intensity and position of the

DGGE gel were imported into R. Both were log10 (x+1) transformed and distance matrices

constructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function in the vegan package in R

(Oksanen et al., 2008). The Bray-Curtis index is one of the most frequently applied

(dis)similarity indices used in ecology (Legendre et al., 2001, Cleary, 2003, Cleary et al., 2004a,

Cleary et al., 2004b, de Voogd et al., 2009). Total rarefied OTU richness per sample was

estimated with a self-written function (Gomes et al., 2010). Variation in OTU composition

among treatments was tested for significance using the Adonis() function. In the Adonis()

analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of OTU composition was the response variable with

treatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999; all other

arguments used the default values set in the function. Variation in the relative abundance of

the most abundant higher taxa (three most abundant phyla; three most abundant classes and

the six most abundant orders) was tested for significance with an analysis of deviance using

the glm() function in R. Since the data was proportional, a glm with the family argument set as

binomial was first applied. However, the ratio of residual deviance to residual d.f in the

models exceeded 1, so the family was set to “quasibinomial”. In the quasibinomial family the

dispersion is not fixed at one so it can model over-dispersion.

Hediste diversicolor stocking in microcosms



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

63

In addition to H. diversicolor, other marine invertebrates (the isopod Cyathura carinata, and the

mudsnail Hydrobia ulvae) were introduced to the microcosms to ensure that all microcosms

were colonized with meiofauna at minimal density levels. However, for the validation of the

ELSS system, only data from H. diversicolor was used as this species has been widely used as a

model or sentinel organism to assess contaminant impact in the field and laboratory (Moreira

et al., 2006)

Invertebrate collection

The three invertebrate species were collected in June 2011 at two reference sites

located in the Mondego (40º 08’ N and 8º 50’ W; C. carinata) and Mira (H. diversicolor and H.

ulvae; 37°40’ N and 8°45’ W). More details about the sampling location and procedures can be

found in supporting information. Hediste diversicolor (7/microcosms), C. carinata (4/microcosm)

and H. ulvae (20/microcosm) were introduced in the microcosm after the 21 day period of

stabilization to the microcosms. These organisms were retrieved from the sediment at the end

of the experiment, counted and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC until

further analysis. Pools of 2 - 3 ragworms from each microcosm were weighed (fresh weight)

and homogenised in ice-cold phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH=7.0 with 0.1% Triton X-100) (1:5

m/v). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. at 4ºC and supernatants were

divided in aliquots and stored at -80 oC.

Biochemical parameters

The total content in protein of each aliquot was determined spectrophotometrically

according to Bradford (1976) using bovine ?-globulin as standard. Catalase (CAT) activity

was measured spectrophotometrically at 240 nm, following Aebi (1984). Superoxide dismutase

(SOD) activity was assessed spectrophotometrically at 505 nm, using the RANSOD

(RANDOXTM) SOD kit and following the procedure described in the manual provided by the

supplier. Glutatione S-transferase (GST) activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340

nm following Hadig et al. (1974). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured

spectrophotometrically at 414 nm, following Ellman et al. (1961). Enzyme activities were

measured in triplicate and expressed in nmol of hydrolyzed substrate per min per mg of



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

64

protein, except for CAT and SOD. CAT was expressed in ?mol of hydrolyzed substrate per

min per mg of protein and SOD in units per gram of protein.

Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was evaluated through the quantification of by-products of

the peroxidation of membrane lipids, like malondialdeyde (MDA), after their reaction with 2-

thiobarbituric acid (TBA), following Buege and Aust (1978). The concentration of

thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS: ?= 1.56x106 M-1cm-1) was measured

spectrophotometrically at 535 nm and expressed in nmols of MDA equivalents per mg of

protein).

The average values recorded for each parameter, in the organisms exposed in the

microcosm control units, were compared with in situ and laboratory values reported in the

literature for H. diversicolor, collected in the same estuary during the same period of the year

(Moreira et al., 2006). The values of AChE, CAT, GST, SOD and LPO activity deviated

significantly from normality (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, P = 0.046, P &amp;lt;0.001, P = 0.013, P

= 0.007, and P = 0.015, respectively). With the exception of GST after logarithmic

transformation (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, P = 0.112), the deviations remained significant

after logarithmic and square-root transformation. GST exhibited homogenous variances

between groups (Bartlett test, chi-squared = 1.31, df = 1, P = 0.251). Therefore, AChE, CAT,

GST, SOD and LPO were tested for significant differences between microcosm and reported

values in literature using the Adonis() function and tested GST using a Student's t.test(). In the

Adonis() analysis, the Euclidean distance matrix of enzyme activity was the response variable

with treatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999; all other

arguments used the default values set in the function.

Results and discussion

Water nutrient validation

During the experimental period, the concentrations of NO3
- did not change

significantly (repeated measures Adonis, F2,9 = 5.35, R
2 = 0.543, P = 0.09). NO3

- varied from

29.96 ± 1.10 µmol l-1 at the beginning, to 42.86 ± 10.1 µmol l-1 after 21 days and 32.38 ± 1.31

µmol l-1 at the end of the experiment. NH4
+ varied from 0.87 ± 0.27 µmol l-1 at the beginning,

1.35 ± 0.74 µmol l-1 after 21 days and 1.42 ± 0.48 µmol l-1 at the end of the experiment. There

was no significant difference in NH4

measures adonis, F2,9 = 1.29, R2 = 0.223, P = 0.27). PO4
3- varied from 1.07 ± 0.05 µmol l-1 at

the beginning to 1.12 ± 0.05 µmol l-1 after 21 days and 1.07 ± 0.05 µmol l-1 at the end of the

experiment (repeated measures Adonis analysis: F2,9 = 1.33, R2 = 0.229, P = 0.35) (Figure S

III-11). In summary, the environmental range of water parameters (temperature, salinity and

pH) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3
-, NH4

+ and PO4
3-) measured in our ELSS

validation were comparable to those recorded in several Portuguese coastal systems (Table S

III-3).

Biological validation

Sediment bacterial diversity

DGGE fingerprinting was used first as a proxy (Cleary et al., 2012) to assess the effect

of the microcosm on bacterial community structure. Ordination analysis of band profiles

revealed significant differences (Adonis, F2,9 = 1.58, R
2 = 0.260, P = 0.007) in composition

among sampling events (Figure S III-12). A 16S RNA cDNA-based barcode pyrosequencing

approach provided a deeper characterization of sediment bacterial communities from ConBs

and ConFs. Barcode pyrosequencing has been successfully used for in-depth studies of

microbial diversity in several ecosystems (Roesch et al., 2007, Gomes et al., 2010, Keijser et al.,

2008, Pires et al., 2012). Most sequence-based studies use DNA libraries. However, DNA

from dormant cells, “dead” cells or extracellular DNA may bias the results (Urich et al., 2008,

Gaidos et al., 2011). RNA cDNA libraries, in contrast, represent more recent activity and allow

insight into compositional differences and in situ activity of microbial community members in

a given setting (Urich et al., 2008). To examine changes in OTU richness occurring during

ELSS experiments, rarefaction curves were generated (Figure III-S13) for ConBs and ConFs.

Controlling for sample size (n = 1800 sequences), OTU richness varied from 751.75 ± 12.76

in ConBs to 519.64 ± 8.23 in ConFs. Rarefied OTU richness was clearly lower at the end of

the experiment. Shifts in bacterial community composition were assessed using PCO

ordination of bacterial OTUs (97%) (Figure III-S14). Composition differed significantly

(Adonis analysis: F1,6 = 3.89, R
2 = 0.039, P = 0.025) between sampling events. Most of the

abundant OTUs (large grey circles; ? 50 sequences) were shared between both treatments.

However, certain dominant populations (OTUs) showed stronger associations to either

ConBs or ConFs samples.

Microcosm manipulation affected bacterial composition by reducing the number of

rare OTUs and increasing the abundance of specific OTUs. This probably occurred because

the microcosm is a more stable and less heterogeneous environment. Reduced disturbance

may have allowed competitively superior groups to out-compete and effectively eliminate

other species. This phenomenon is in line with the intermediate disturbances hypothesis

(IDH) (Connell, 1978). Such an effect can also occur within different habitats in natural

marine environments, which are commonly subjected to several levels of heterogeneity and

disturbance regimes (Gingold et al., 2010). For example, the presence of bioturbating shrimps

in marine sediment habitats has been shown to induce changes in composition of sediment

bacterial communities and increase bacterial diversity (Laverock et al. (2010).

Bacterial composition analysis showed that 74.03 ± 4.28% of all reads were assigned

to the Proteobacteria at the beginning of the experiment. This proportion rose to 95.74 ± 1.47%

at the end of the experiment. The different classes of this phylum are often abundant in

marine sediment (Gomes et al., 2010, Jiang et al., 2009). Within the Proteobacteria, the

Gammaproteobacteria was the most dominant class; their relative abundance ranged from 36.39±

7.08%, at the beginning of the experiment to 47.12± 4.14% at the end. The

Gammaproteobacteria is the largest Proteobacteria group in terms of diversity and includes a wide

range of phenotypic and metabolic diversity with recognized importance (Kersters et al., 2006).

The relative abundance of the Deltaproteobacteria class increased significantly after microcosm

manipulation from 18.60 ± 6.04% at the beginning of the experiment to 42.70 ± 5.25 % at the

end (Anova, F1,6 , P = 0.003). Our results show that this trend was mainly related to an

increase in the relative abundance of the Desulfobacterales order, which includes anaerobic

sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) (Figure III-2). SRB play an essential role in a variety of

processes in anoxic marine sediment including organic matter turnover, pollutant

detoxification and the carbon and sulphur cycles (Zhang et al., 2008). SRB use sulphate as an

electron acceptor in the degradation of organic compounds resulting in the production of

sulphide through the dissimilatory sulphate reduction pathway (Muyzer et al., 2008). Our ELSS

was set to simulate the central area of the Ria de Aveiro mesotidal system, where

approximately 50% of the water volume is renewed between tides (Dias et al., 2001). However,

the original sampling site in particular, is subject to intense water renewal, and being at an

intertidal zone, the sediment is exposed to air during low tide. This implies that the

microcosms simulated a more anoxic environment than that of the original sampling site,

leading to an increased relative abundance of anaerobic Desulfobacterales. Introduction of

ragworm to the system might also influence bacterial community structure. Although

bioturbation is generally associated with an increase in oxic zones in the sediment, infaunal

activity can also augment anaerobic processes such as sulphate reduction (Bertics et al., 2010).

Figure III-2: Relative abundance of the most dominant bacterial taxa (three most abundant phylum; three must
abundant classes and the six must abundant orders) the sediment collected in the environment (ConBs) and from

the sediment retrieved from the microcosm after 57 days of operation (ConFs). Summary from analysis of

deviance (glm with ‘quasibinomial’ family) is indicated above the bars. Note that analyses of deviance was not

perform on Cyanobacteria, since sequences affiliated with this group were not detected in all samples.

Nevertheless, the simulated conditions did not exclude important functional aerobic groups in

sediment biogeochemical processes. The abundance of OTUs belonging to the Methylococcales

order increased after microcosm manipulation from 3.19 ± 3.23% at the beginning of the

experiment to 13.26 ± 1.60% at the end. This order includes several members that oxidize

methane under aerobic or microaerobic conditions (Bowman, 2005).

In contrast to the Deltaproteobacteria, the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria declined from

18.70 ± 12.14% at the beginning of the experiment to 5.36 ± 1.60% at the end. This was

mainly related to a reduction in the abundance of the Rhodobacterales order, which declined

from 11.98 ± 11.13% at the beginning of the experiment to 1.08 ± 0.80% at the end. Within

the Rhodobacterales, several OTUs belonging to the Rhodobacteraceae family were detected.

Rhodobacteraceae includes the Roseobacter clade, one of the major marine groups; 20% of coastal

and 15% of mixed-layer ocean bacterioplankton communities consist of members of this

clade (Sørensen et al., 2005). Given that members of this group are likely present in water,

their higher relative abundance in the sediment samples retrieved from the environment could

be due to near-shore seawater infiltration, thus explaining their reduction following the

microcosm experiment. Several phylotypes related to the Roseobacter clade were found in an

endovaporitic microbial mat and the authors attributed this finding to seawater infiltration in

the mat (Sørensen et al., 2005). Other less abundant phyla such as Cyanobacteria and

Actinobacteria were also less abundant at the end of the experiment.

The distribution of dominant (? 50 sequences) OTUs across all samples is visualized

using a heatmap (Figure S III-15). Results from this analysis are in line with the pattern

detected in the relative abundance analysis. Several abundant OTUs detected at the beginning

of the experiment remained among the most dominant OTUs at the end of the experiment,

including several known aerobic and anaerobic groups (e.g., Gammaproteobacteria – OTU 2987,

OTU 2315, OTU 3254; Deltaproteobacteria - Desulfobacteraceae – OTU 3129; Methylococcales -

1648). As outlined above, several sulphate reducing bacterial OTUs increased their abundance

in microcosm samples (e.g., Desulfobacteraceae OTUs – 1724; 1325), whereas members of the

Rhodobacterales order declined in abundance at the end of the experiment (e.g., OTUs - 1569;

675).

Hediste diversicolor biochemical parameters

Hediste diversicolor has been indicated as an adequate sentinel species for transitional

waters due to its wide distribution, sensitivity and its role in the functioning and structure of

marine ecosystems (Scaps, 2002, Moreira et al., 2006, Bouraoui et al., 2009, Solé et al., 2009).

Ragworms usually move actively around the sediment surface or within their burrow systems

looking for food (Kristensen, 2001). Furthermore, these organisms are both sediment eaters

(Solé et al., 2009) and suspension feeders (Kristensen, 2001 and references cited), features that

increase the chances of exposure to contaminants associated with different sediment

components, overlying water and interstitial water.

At the end of the experiment 96.40% of stocked H. diversicolor were recovered,

indicating that the architecture and the conditions of the system did not compromise the

survival of these organisms even during long-lasting exposure. Figure III-3 shows boxplots for

values recorded for each biochemical parameter monitored for H. diversicolor specimens

stocked in the microcosms of our ELSS, as well as ranges of values available in the study of

Moreira et al. (2006) for this species, collected in the same estuary and in the same period of

the year. The comparability with organisms collected at the same period of the year is of

particular importance as the influence of seasonal (e.g., water temperature) factors,

physiological factors, sexual condition, gametogenesis period and behaviour in antioxidant

enzyme levels is well known (Sun et al., 2008). Compared to the previous study of Moreira et

al. (2006), no significant differences were observed in the activity of AChE (Adonis, F1,7 =

0.89, R2 = 0.113, P = 0.380;  F1,17 = 1.75, R
2 = 0.094, P = 0.174, comparing with in situ and

laboratory data from Moreira et al., 2006, respectively), thus, denoting no neurologic adverse

effects of microcosm exposure in the polychaete. The activity of CAT and GST were

significantly higher in the present study in comparison to results obtained by Moreira et al.

(2006) (Adonis for CAT: F1,7 = 6.66, R
2 = 0.487, P = 0.061;  F1,17 = 16.67, R

2 = 0.495, P =

0.002 and Student-t test for GST: t4,5 =5.6, p&lt;0.001 and t4,15 = 5.6, p&lt;0.001, respectively, when

compared with laboratory and in situ data for each enzyme). However, the differences

registered in GST activity between the present work and the results obtained by Moreira et al.

(2006) with organisms exposed, under controlled condition, in the laboratory was 22%, which

is close to the 20% threshold commonly considered to be within the normal range of activity

of the enzyme and to have no biological significance (Olsen et al., 2001). The activity measured

for SOD and LPO in H. diversicolor exposed in the ELSS was significantly lower than that

reported by the latter authors (Adonis for SOD: F1,7 = 339.25, R2 = 0.979, P = 0.008;  F1,17 =

846.06, R2 = 0.980, P = 0.001 and Adonis for LPO: F1,7 = 78.79, R2 = 0.918, P = 0.008;  F1,17
= 100.04, R2 = 0.855, P = 0.001). These observations indicate that the organisms were not

under neurologic or oxidative stress. The apparent depression in SOD activity may also have

been the result of the different methods applied to assess this enzyme in both studies.

Temperature and the sediment sulphide content have been pointed out as factors responsible

for the induction of SOD activity in H. diversicolor, while anoxia seems to have a non

significant effect on the activity of this enzyme (Abele-Oeschger et al., 1994, Sun et al., 2008).

Thus, the lower temperature to which the ragworms have been exposed in the microcosm, in

comparison to the field conditions, may have been responsible for the depression in SOD

activity. Temperature effect is also likely to affect the activity of the other tested enzymes,

since a similar decreasing trend has been reported for antioxidant enzyme activities in

invertebrate species with decreasing temperatures (Khessiba et al., 2005; Sroda and Cossu-

Leguille, 2011; Kong et al., 2012). However, the temperatures that produced a significant

reduction in the activity of stress biomarkers in the referenced studies were lower than those

recorded in the ELSS, and in some cases variation with temperature displayed a sex-dependent

tendency (Sroda and Cossu-Leguille, 2011). Similarly, contradictory relationships between

temperature and SOD activity in H. diversicolor have been reported (Abele-Oeschger et al.,

1994, Sun et al., 2008). Although the ELSS appeared to induce anaerobic conditions, a

sulphide rich environment and promote the abundance of SRB, our results failed to show

oxidative stress induction in ragworms.

Experimental life support system applications

In this study we have described the development and validation of an experimental

microcosm framework capable of simulating fundamental dynamics of coastal systems. Water

inorganic nutrient concentrations remained fairly stable during validation trials, exhibiting

comparable values to those recorded in the coastal lagoon. Bacterial community structure

validation revealed that the microcosm operational programme introduced a shift that

favoured the SRB group in particular. However, these changes do not necessarily imply a

strong shift in community functioning, given that the most abundant classes were still

detected in samples at the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, if deemed necessary, aerobic

conditions can be stimulated by choosing different tidal ranges with different percentages of

water renewal. At the end of the validation period, the biomarkers of H. diversicolor were within

the same magnitude of values reported in the literature for organisms collected in the same

estuary, under reference conditions.

The ELSS described here can be easily reproduced and operated under a moderate

budget. We estimated that the replication of this system would cost approximately 15000



Development and validation of an ELSS for estuarine and costal benthic communities

72

euros. Assuming 0.098 euros per Kilowatt hour-1 (average price of electricity for industry in

the European Union for the second semester 2012 -

http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nrg_pc_205&amp;amp;lang=en), a daily

operational cost of approximately 4.09 euros was estimated. If necessary, the system

architecture is sufficient flexible to allow for the replacement of several subsystems in order to

fit specific research needs. Its modular construction enables the setting of a multitude of

statistically robust complex experimental designs. By changing the pre-sets of the ELSS values

with respect to temperature and pH subsystems, it is possible to simulate several scenarios of

global climate change, such as the postulated increase in temperature and reduction in pH  in

marine environments. If users choose to use natural seawater and operate under a closed

recirculated water system, it is important that other parameters related to inorganic C species,

such as dissolved inorganic carbon or total alkalinity, are monitored since carbonate chemistry

can be affected. Irradiance values can also be manipulated by varying lamp intensity and time

of operation. For example, scenarios predicting an increase in UV-B can be simulated by

simply removing the glass filter used in our validation trials and by manipulating lamp

intensity.

This system can be used to establish cause-effect relationships on the impact of

climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on coastal marine benthic communities and

processes. For example, the ELSS could be used to study bacterial mediated degradation (e.g.,

petroleum hydrocarbon degradation) in coastal systems under various climate change

scenarios. Hediste diversicolor stress indicators could then be applied to assess the toxicity of

degradation products. The data thus obtained can provide the basis for our understanding

how climate change and pollution may interact to affect coastal marine ecosystems in the

future.

Lighting system

Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (µmol photons m-2 s-1) was measured with a

Quantum Meter with a separate sensor (Model MQ-200, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah,

USA). The spectrum of photosynthetic active radiation was acquired using a USB2000

spectroradiometer, with spectral resolution of 0.38 nm (USB2000-VISNIR, grating #3, Ocean

Optics, Duiven, Netherlands) and a 400 µm diameter fiberoptic (QP400-2-VIS/NIR-BX,

Ocean Optics). UV irradiances were accessed with a spectro-radiometer connected to a

monochromator that provides information on the spectral irradiance with a resolution of one

nanometer. Spectral irradiance was obtained by the BenWin+ Software (Bentham

Instruments, Reading, UK) (Ribeiro et al., 2011). Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, PAR

and UV spectra were measured under each luminaire in minimum tide high in the middle and

border microcosm.

pH control system

Figure S III-10: Average pH measured during one week every two days in control and reduced pH treatments.
For each treatment the pH was measured in four microcosms at the end of each low tide. In order to achieve a

pH reduction of 0.3 in each microcosm, the acidified reservoir water was adjusted to a pH value of 7.2.

Collection of invertebrates and microcosm exposure

The invertebrate species were collected by hand, at the low tide (H. diversicolor and H.

ulvae at a salinity of 33-35 and water temperature 23oC and C. carinata at a salinity of 30 and

water temperature 21ºC) 21 days after the beginning of the experiment, and transported to the

laboratory in plastic containers filled with local water. In the laboratory the organisms were

separated from debris and a pool of organisms with a similar body size, for each species, was

obtained. From this pool, 30 organisms, for H. diversicolor and H. ulvae, were randomly chosen

for the evaluation of their biomass, as dry weight. For dry weight estimations, organisms were

left in filtered (10 µm) local water for 24 h, time after which they were dried at 60oC for 72 h.

The dry weight was then estimated to the nearest 0.01 g (Kern ALS-A, Kern and Sohn,

Balingen, Germany). Mean (± standard deviation) biomass of organisms to be used was 15

(±4.7) mg for H. diversicolor and 0.90 (±4.7) mg for C. carinata. For H. ulvae (n = 30), organisms

with a shell length and width of 5.28 (±0.35) mm and 2.61 (±0.20) mm, respectively, were

used. Organisms to be used in the microcosm were randomly distributed into groups of seven,

twenty and four, respectively for H. diversicolor, H. ulvae and C. carinata (corresponding,

respectively, to a density of 0.03, 0.09, and 0.02 organisms cm2, thus, avoiding stress due to

overloading of the system, as this density is below the densities observed at the Mira estuary

and those reported in literature to induce stress due to overloading-approximately 0.8 and 1.8

organisms cm2 (Costa et al., 2001, Barnes, 2001) and maintained in 50 ml polypropylene vials

filled with local estuarine water, at 19 to 21ºC under a photoperiod of 16hL:8hD. The day the

experiment was started, i.e., approximately 24 h after being collected, groups of seven worms,

twenty mudsnails and four isopods were placed into four microcosm independent control

units in contact with the sediment (see previous material and methods sections).

Profilling of the active bacterial community

16S rRNA sequence analysis

Only sequences containing exact matches to primer sequences and barcode tags were

used for further analysis. Raw sequencing reads were quality trimmed according to published

recommendations (Kuczynski et al., 2011) and the QIIME software package

(http://qiime.sourceforge.net/; Accessed 8 October 2012) was applied to analyze the results

of the runs. The ‘pick_otus.py’ function in QIIME with the usearch quality filter and the

default sequence similarity threshold of 0.97 was used to assign sequences to operational

taxonomic units (OTUs). The usearch quality filter is a pipeline script developed using

USEARCH to perform filtering of noisy sequences, chimera check and OTU picking

(http://qiime.org/tutorials/usearch_quality_filter.html; Accessed 8 October 2012). Chimera

filter was performed de novo using UCHIME and against a reference database. UCHIME has

better sensitivity than the previously most sensitive database method ChimeraSlayer and is

more than 1000 times faster (Edgar et al., 2011).

A representative OTU set was chosen with the ‘pick_rep_set.py’ function using the

'most abundant' method. Sequences belonging to the representative set were classified

taxonomically with the ‘assign_taxonomy.py’ function in QIIME with the Naive Bayesian

rRNA RDP Classifier method and 80% minimum confidence score. Chimeric sequences,

plant organelles or sequences not classified as Bacteria (e.g., Archaea) were removed prior to

statistical analysis. The ‘make otu_table.py’ function in QIIME was used to generate a square

matrix containing the abundance of all OTU's per sample that was used in subsequent

analysis.

After quality screening with QIIME pipeline a total of 26252 sequences,

corresponding to 3658 OTU´s, were identified in sediment control samples from the

environment and from the microcosm. Per sample, sequences ranged from 1819 in Con2B to

4830 in Con3F, corresponding to 534 and 1305 OTU´s, respectively.

Abstract: There is near unanimous consensus that climate change has the potential to alter marine ecosystems.
However, researchers are still far from understanding the extent and consequences (if any) of climate change

interactions with other anthropogenic stressors. Due to its complex nature, the effects of climate change (e.g.

ocean acidification) and other anthropogenic stressors have mainly been accessed independently. A possible

way of understanding these interactions is through experimentation under well-controlled conditions. With this

work we demonstrate that the combination of reduced water pH and oil contamination can alter the structure

of the active bacterial communities of shallow estuarine sediment. Anaerobic sulphate reducing bacteria

drastically reduced their relative abundance under oil contamination and pH values projected for the end of this

century. 16S RNA (cDNA) based predicted metagenome suggested that several oil contaminant degradation

pathways could be affected in these conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that in future ocean

reduced pH conditions the impact of an oil spill can be substantially different than under current pH levels.

Introduction

Marine environments are exposed to a range of factors that are fundamentally

altering the chemistry of the ocean at unprecedented rates (Doney 2010). Since the beginning

of the industrial revolution, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have

increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from approximately 280 ppmv (parts per

million volume) (Indermühle et al., 1999) to nearly 394 ppmv in 2012 (NOAA Earth System

Research Laboratory, 2012).

Between one-quarter to a one-third of the excess CO2 has been absorbed by the

oceans, reducing seawater pH and inducing modifications in fundamental chemical balances

between inorganic carbon species (Sabine et al., 2004, Richard et al., 2009). This process,

known as ocean acidification, is often referred to as “the other CO2 problem” (Doney et al.,



Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

106

2009). The magnitude of this process is such that modelled predictions on the disruption of

the ocean carbonate chemistry have no parallel in the past 300 million years of earth´s

geological record (Hönisch et al., 2012).

The implementation of the Montreal protocol has successfully reduced ozone-

depleting substances (Mckenzie et al., 2011). However, increasing concentrations of

greenhouse gases are expected to interact with ozone and alter its spatial distribution and

exchanges between the stratosphere and troposphere, with potential effects on UVR levels

that reach the earth (Bais et al., 2011). Furthermore, warming, acidification and changes in

ocean stratification patterns are also expected to increase the penetration of UVR in the

water column and enhance organism exposure to UV-B in forthcoming years (UNEP 2010).

In addition to the effects on the global climate system, human activities such as fossil

fuel combustion, fertilizer use, and industrial activity have been seriously and adversely

affecting coastal and open-ocean environments for decades, as they cause a continuous

influx of pollutants (including oil hydrocarbons, pesticides and heavy metals) (Doney 2010).

Oil hydrocarbons (OH) are probably one of the most widespread pollutants in oceans

worldwide. The Deepwater Horizon tragic accident alone released an estimated volume of

4.4×106 ± 20% barrels of oil (7.0×105 m3) into the ocean (Crone and Tolstoy 2010).

Both ocean acidification and UVR have the potential to interact with other

anthropogenic stressors such as oil hydrocarbons leading to changes in marine ecosystems

(Fabry et al., 2008, Hader et al., 2011). However, we still lack a fundamental knowledge on

how these stressors will interact, compromising our ability to predict sudden contamination

impacts in future ecosystems. Understanding the impacts of these interactions on microbial

communities and microbial mediated biogeochemical processes is fundamental to determine

how ecosystems will react. Microbial communities and their activities drive important

ecosystem functions. For example, the ability of bacteria to use OH as a carbon and energy

source greatly influences the environmental detoxification of an oil spill (Head et al., 2006).

We hypothesized that the impact of an oil spill in marine ecosystems causes a significant shift

on microbial communities under increased UV-B and reduced water pH. We tested this

hypothesis by characterizing the independent and interactive effect of these stressors on

estuarine sediment microbial communities using an experimental life support system (ELSS).

This system allows simulating coastal and estuarine ecosystems and has been previously

validated to simulate climate change scenarios on benthic communities (Coelho et al., in

press).

Methods

Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis

Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined using a soxhlet extraction

followed by a GC-MS analysis (Yan et al., 2009). Approximately 5 g of sediment were

collected from oil contaminated treatments (OnOi, UVOi, pHOi and UVTot) and from

control treatments (Cont). The sediment was homogenized and freeze-dried before

extraction. The sediment was spiked with 25 µl (2 µg/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate

standards (Supelco) containing naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10,

chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 and soxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h

naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 and

soxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h (Yan et al. 2009). The first fraction,

corresponding to aliphatic hydrocarbons, was eluted with 15 ml of n-hexane. The second

fraction, containing PAH compounds, was collected by eluting 30 ml of n-

hexane/dichloromethane (1:1, v:v). The two fractions were combined for analysis. The

determination of the two hydrocarbons fraction was performed on a Network GC system

6890/5973 (Agilent Technologies, USA) mass spectrometer with a 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm

film thickness VF-5MS fused silica column in the selective ion mode (SIM) for aromatic

hydrocarbons or in scanning mode for aliphatic hydrocarbons. More details can be found in

hydrocarbon analysis section in supporting information.

Active bacterial community profiling

Four composite samples consisting of four sediment cores (~1 cm of top sediment

with a 1 cm diameter) were collected in the microcosms after 57 days of operation.

Approximately 1 g of the sediment layer was directly transferred into a 2.0 ml screw cap tube

containing Lysing Matrix E (FastRNA® Pro Soil-Direct Kit, Qbiogene Inc.,CA) and

immediately immerse in liquid nitrogen (Liu et al. 2011). Samples were kept at -80 ºC until the

RNA extraction.

Total RNA was isolated from sediment samples using the FastPrep® Instrument

(Qbiogene, Inc, CA), for 40 s at a speed setting of 6.0 according to the manufacturer's

instructions. Residual DNA was removed using Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems,



Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

108

Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was then converted to single stranded cDNA using random

hexamer-primed reverse transcription by applying SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase

Kit (Invitrogen). The complete removal of DNA was confirmed by PCR. Universal bacterial

primers U27 and 1492R were used to amplify ca. 1450 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Weisburg

et al., 1991). Specific products were detected in cDNA samples after reverse transcription,

but not in their corresponding source RNA samples (data not shown).

A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for microbial community analysis.

Fragments of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were sequenced for each sample with

primers V3 Forward (5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3’) and V4 Reverse (5’-

TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3’) using the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Life

Sciences Roche Diagnostics Ltd, West Sussex, UK). Only sequences containing exact

matches to primer sequences and barcode tags were used for further analysis.

Sequence Analysis

Raw sequencing reads were quality trimmed according to published

recommendations (Kuczynski et al. 2011) and the QIIME software package

(http://qiime.org; Accessed 4 May 2012) was applied to analyze the results of the runs.

Sequences can be downloaded from the NCBI ShortRead Archive, accession numbers (study

accession number - SRP021163). The ‘pick_otus.py’ function in QIIME with the uclust

method and the default sequence similarity threshold of 0.97 was used to assign sequences to

operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A representative OTUs set was chosen with the

‘pick_rep_set.py’ function using the 'most abundant' method. Sequences belonging to the

representative set were classified taxonomically with the ‘assign_taxonomy.py’ function in

QIIME with the Naive Bayesian rRNA RDP Classifier method and 80% minimum

confidence score. Chimeric sequences (identified using the parallel identify chimeric ‘seqs.py’

function in QIIME), plant organelles or sequences not classified as Bacteria (e.g., Archaea)

were removed prior to statistical analysis. The ‘make otu_table.py’ function in QIIME was

used to generate a square matrix containing the abundance of all OTUs per sample that was

used in subsequent analysis.

Total rarefied OTUs richness per sample was estimated with a self-written function

(Gomes et al., 2010) in R (http://www.r-project.org/; Accessed 6 January 2013). Rarefied

OTUs richness was selected for a minimum sampling size of 1800 sequences. Shapiro-Wilk



Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

109

test() was used to test for normality and Bartlett test() was used to test the assumption of

homogenous variance. Analysis of variance (Anova) was then used to test if rarefied richness

differed significantly between treatments. Variation in OTUs composition among treatments

was tested for significance using the adonis() function in vegan (Oksanen et al., 2012). In the

Adonis analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of OTUs composition was the response

variable with treatment as independent variable. The number of permutations was set at 999.

The argument strata was included to allow randomizations only within each luminaire

(Oksanen et al. 2012). Variation in composition among treatments was assessed with

Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO), using the cmdscale() function in the R base package

and wascores() function in vegan. Prior to the PCO, the raw data was log10 (x+1)

transformed and used to produce a distance matrix based on the Bray-Curtis distance with

the vegdist() function in vegan.

We used Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of

Unobserved Sates (PICRUST-http://picrust.github.com/picrust/Accessed 24 January 2013)

software package to predict the metagenome functional content from the 16S rRNA dataset.

The ‘pick_reference_otus_through_otu_table.py’ was used to pick OTU´s against a reference

collection with OTU´s assigned at a 97% similarity. The OTU table obtained was then

normalize dividing each OTU by the know/predicted 16S copy number with

‘normalize_by_copy_number.py’ function. The ‘predict_metagenomes.py’ function was used

to create a square matrix, containing normalized OTU abundance multiply by each predicted

functional trait abundance per sample, that was used in subsequent analysis.

Variation in OTUs and KO relative abundances was analyzed with a mixed-model

approach, treating oil, UV-B and reduced pH as fixed effects and the luminaires as the

random effect. Since we wanted to examine the interaction between oil, UV-B and pH we

included an interaction term. The mixed-model was fitted using glmer function in the lme4

package with family argument set to binomial (Bates et al., 2011). Overdispersion was

accounted for by including individual level variability as a random effect (Bates et al., 2011).

The significance on the main effects and interaction terms was tested using the z -statistics.

With this approach pseudo-replication was accounted for (i.e. oil contamination, reduced

water pH and UV-B treatment split within four luminaires).

Sample Collection and Experimental Manipulation

A fully factorial experiment was designed using 32 independent microcosms with

three treatments: UV-B radiation, water pH and OH contamination. Each treatment had two

levels: UV-B (with and without), pH (normal and reduced) and Oil (with and without). The

treatments were replicated into four random independent microcosms and arranged in a

randomized split-plot design with UV-B as the whole plot and pH and oil at the sub-plot

levels. The design enabled us to distinguish 8 distinct groups. These groups included 1. Cont

(no UV-B, normal pH and no oil), 2. OnpH (no UV-B, reduced pH, no oil), 3. OnUV (UV-

B, normal pH and no oil), 4. UVpH (UV-B, reduced pH, no oil), 5. OnOi (no UV-B, normal

pH, oil), 6. UVOi (UV-B, normal pH, oil), 7. pHOi (no UV-B, reduced pH, oil) and finally 8.

UVTot (UV-B, reduced pH, oil). The experiment was divided into two phases. In the first

phase, the sediment was stabilized during 22 days. In this phase pH was gradually reduced in

reduced pH treatments while the UV-B system operated with the same intensity during all

the experiment. The second phase started on day 22, with the simulation of an oil spill by

pouring oil into oil contaminated treatments. This phase lasted 35 days, until we visually

confirmed the degradation of the most part of the oil from the water surface. Polycyclic

aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon analysis from sediment collected from oil contaminated

and control treatments did not reveal significant differences (Figure S IV-1) and S IV-2),

further suggesting that most of the oil hydrocarbons were already degraded at this time.

The microcosms were subjected to a uniform semi-diurnal tidal regime, experiencing

two high tides and two low tides daily. Water pH was manipulated by bubbling CO2 into

water (Gattuso and Lavigne 2009) reservoirs prior addition into the microcosms. The

acidified water was supplied with a pH value of 7.2 to the microcosms in each high tide. The

sediment carbonate chemistry impacted the water pH that tended to increase along each tide.

Nonetheless, the minimum pH reduction in relation to control microcosms was 0.3, which

falls within the 0.3-0.4 pH reduction modeled for global sea surface for the year 2100

(Caldeira et al., 2003). The average pH was 7.64±0.11 in acidified microcosms (measured at

the end of each low tide, before the addition of new acidified water) and 7.95 ±0.09 in the

control microcosms (Figure S IV-3).

noontime, was used in microcosms with UV-B. This value is similar to the typical DNA-

damaging UV dose observed in Lisbon in June. Since UV-A radiation is practically

unaffected by changes in ozone depletion and plays an important role in photo-repair

mechanisms (Bargagli 2005), a similar amount of UV-A integrated irradiance of

2875.91±264.62 mWm-2 was supplemented to the microcosms.

Active bacterial community

The active bacterial community from each treatment was characterized by using a

barcoded pyrosequencing approach of the bacterial 16S rRNA (cDNA) gene. Sequences

were assign to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity with a

cut off value of 97% (Roesch et al., 2007). To examine changes in OTUs richness, rarefaction

curves were generated for all treatments (Figure S IV-5). Controlling for sampling size (n=

1800 sequences) rarefied OTUs richness varied from 490±68.52 for OnOi, to 557±48.68 for

OnUV (Figure S IV-3). No significant differences in OTUs richness were detected between

treatments (Anova, F7,24 = 1.29, R
2 = 0.868, P = 0.54). On the contrary, there was a

significant variation in OTUs composition between treatments (Adonis analysis: F7,31 =

1.563, R2 =0.313, P&lt;0.001). A principal coordinate analysis (PCO) using the Bray-Curtis

distance of OTUs composition was applied to visualize the dissimilarities between the

different treatments (Figure IV-1).

Figure IV-1: Principal coordinates analysis of operational taxonomic unit  (OTU) composition. The first two axes are
shown based on a matrix of OTU composition. Cont - control with no treatment; OnpH - reduced pH; OnUV -
exposed to UV-B; UVpH - reduced pH and UV-B exposed; OnOi - contaminated with oil; UVOi - contaminated with
oil and exposed to UV-B; pHOi - contaminated with oil and reduced pH; UVTot - contaminated with oil and exposed
to UV-B and reduced pH.

The primary and secondary axis of variation was between the Cont group and the samples

retrieved from the pHOi group. UVTot group also exhibited a variation from other groups,

although less pronounced than pHOi. Using the RDP classifier, with a confidence threshold

of 80%, 128313 out of 129282 (99.25%) qualified sequences were assigned to known phyla.

Proteobacteria was the most represented phylum varying from 95.92±1.35% of total identified

OTUs in OnOi to 88.55±5.20% in pHOi group. We therefore, tested the interactive effect

of oil, pH and UV-B on the relative abundance of the three most representative Proteobacteria

groups classified at order level (Figure IV-2). Together, these four groups varied from

76.12±9.91% in pHOi to 87.21±2.39% in Cont (The relative abundance of all Proteobacteria

orders is available in supportive information Figure S IV-8). Within these four orders the

most notable effects in relative abundance was detected in Desulfobacterales. We detected a

significant interactive effect between oil and reduced pH treatment in the relative abundance

of Desulfobacterales (Wald Z test, z = -3.046, P = 0.002). Indeed, in line with the PCO analysis,

the most drastic effect was a decrease in the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales in

microcosms with oil under reduced pH. In oil contaminated microcosms the relative

abundance of Desulfobacterales decreased from 50.71±6.96%, under normal water pH and

without UV-B, to 19.56±7.36%, in microcosms with reduced pH without UV-B. On the

other hand, no significant effect of oil (Wald Z test, z = 1.386, P = 0.166), UV-B (Wald Z

test, z = -1.186, P = 0.235) or pH (Wald Z test, z = -1.408, P = 0.159) alone was detected,

thus suggesting a synergistic interaction between oil and reduced water pH (Figure IV-2).

Such a drastic reduction in active Desulfobacterales members could have consequences

for the degradation of organic pollutants in contaminated marine sediments under reduced

water pH without UV-B. Desulfobacterales order includes diverse anaerobic sulphate-reducing

bacteria. These bacteria are characterized by their ability to use sulphate as terminal electron

acceptor in the oxidation of H2 and organic compounds. This directly links them to the

cycling of carbon and sulphur and to the degradation of organic contaminants, including oil

hydrocarbons, in a variety of habitats (Muyzer and Stams 2008, Zhou et al., 2011). The

observed decrease thus suggests that after oil contamination and under reduced pH the

degradation of organic contaminants can be substantially affected. Interestingly, although no

significant differences were detected in hydrocarbon concentration between treatments with

oil, the highest values for several aliphatic (e.g. 1-decene and dodecene) and aromatic

hydrocarbons (e.g. acenaphtylene, acenaphthene and fluorene) were detected in combined oil

and reduced pH treatment (Figure S IV-1 and S IV-2). However, these values showed high



Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

113

standard deviation hampering the detection of significant differences in the amount of

hydrocarbon removal between different groups.

A significant interactive effect on the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales was also

detected between oil, UV-B and reduced pH treatment (Wald Z test, z = -3.046, P = 0.002).

However, in this case, the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales was 29.70±0.75, similar to

31.83±0.79 registered in oil contaminated sediments under normal pH with UV-B. Probably,

in this case, oil hydrocarbon photochemical modification due to the presence of UV-B

masked the interaction between oil and pH detected without UV-B.

Figure IV-2: Relative abundance of OTUs classified at order level under the independent and combined
effects of reduced pH, UV-B exposure and oil contamination. Sequences reads (from 454 Genome Sequencer

The three most abundant orders are shown.

Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

114

A significant interaction was also detected in oil, UV-B and reduced pH treatment in

the relative abundance of Methylococcales (Wald Z test, z = 2.156, P = 0.031). However,

contrary to what was observed in Desulfobacterales, the relative abundance of Methylococcales was

the highest in the microcosm with oil, UV-B and reduced pH. In oil contaminated

microcosms, the relative abundance of this order increase from 9.81±1.63%, under normal

pH and without UV-B, to 18.59±3.54%, under reduced pH and in the presence of UV-B.

Functionally, order Methylococcales includes aerobic bacteria capable of oxidizing and utilizing

methane (methanotrophic) and other C1 compounds (methylotrophic) as source of carbon

and energy (Bowman 2005). Methanotrophic bacteria respond rapidly to increase methane

concentrations, and it has been suggested that they may act as an important biofilter that

limits the release of CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere (Kessler et al., 2011). This sudden

increase can be caused by the combined presence of UV-B and pH. The presence of UV-B

can induce the formation of C1 compounds through photochemical degradation of oil

hydrocarbons whereas pH has been shown to exert a strong influence on other

methylotrophic bacteria, in ocean acidification mesocosms experiments (Roy et al., 2012).

Indeed, an independent effect of pH (Wald Z test, z = 1.672, P = 0.094) and oil (Wald Z

test, z = -1.846, P = 0.064) was detected in order Methylococcales.

Predicted metagenome analysis

Here we used the PICRUSt software (http://picrust.github.com/picrust/) to predict

metagenome functional contents based on the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes

(KEGG) classification to identify potential bacterial traits in our samples. Given the drastic

decrease in Desulfobacterales the focus was specifically set on the relative abundance of KEGG

orthologs (KO) assigned to the category “xenobiotics and degradation”. The independent

and interactive effect of oil, pH and UV-B on the relative abundance of the six most

representative pathways was analysed (Figure IV-3). The relative abundance of all KEGG

categories and of all xenobiotics and degradation pathways is available in supportive

information Figures S IV-6 and S IV-7. The predicted metagenome for these categories was

consistent with taxon responses. A significant interaction between oil and reduced pH in

benzoate degradation (Wald Z test, z = -3.14, P = 0.002), caprolactam degradation (Wald Z

test, z = -3.40, P &amp;lt;0.002) and ethylbenzene degradation (Wald Z test, z = -4.53, P &amp;lt;0.001)

pathways was found. The relative abundance of KO assigned to these pathways decreased

with oil contamination under reduced pH conditions in the absence of UV-B.

These results suggest that in these conditions, the pathways responsible for degrading these

compounds are underrepresented in relation to the other treatments. However, metagenome

prediction also revealed functional implications that were not clear from the community

analysis. An interaction between reduced pH and oil in toluene degradation (Wald Z test, z =

3.2, P = 0.001) and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (Wald the Z test, z = 3,

P &amp;lt;0.0027) with a consequent increase in the relative abundance of KO orthologs was

observed. Importantly, these results reinforced the hypothesis that the observed changes

under combined effect of oil and pH can have potential functional implications on

contaminant degradation pathways.

The five most abundant, plus PAH, degradation pathways are shown.



Ocean acidification and oil contamination have a synergistic effect on microbial composition

116

Conclusions

Impacts of ocean acidification and reduction of water pH can be exacerbated in

coastal and estuarine waters due to increased eutrophication and the consequent

development of hypoxic and anoxic zones (Howarth et al., 2011). The major effect detected

in our multifactorial experiment was a reduction of Desulfobacterales order due to a synergistic

interaction between oil contaminated sediments and reduced water pH. Considering the role

that sulphate-reducing bacteria have in anaerobic OH degradation, such a drastic reduction

can alter the detoxification capacity of marine sediment, increasing the toxicity of impacted

ecosystems. Interestingly, probably due to photochemistry modifications of OH, a moderate

level of UV-B appears to attenuate these effects. Therefore, it is likely that the magnitude of

these interactions and their effects will depend on the level of UV-B that penetrates the

impacted ecosystem. Oxidation of organic compounds coupled to the reduction of sulphate

to sulfite may account for more than 50% of organic matter mineralization in the sea bed

(Jorgensen 1982). Given that acidification will not be limited to surface waters and will also

occur in the deep ocean (Orr et al., 2005) with low or absent ultraviolet radiation, the

degradation of OH in these environments can be considerably affected with widespread

consequences to higher trophic levels. Considering the implications of the observed effects

to microbial communities we suggest that future studies focus on the mechanisms that

underlie the synergistic interactions between ocean acidification and oil contamination.

Hydrocarbon analysis

Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons were determined using a Soxhlet extraction

followed by a GC-MS analysis. Approximately 5 g of homogenized and freeze-dried

sediment were spiked with 25 µl (2 µg/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate standards (Supelco)

containing naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12
and soxhlet extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane for 24 h (Yan et al., 2009). The extract was

concentrated by a rotator evaporator up to a volume of about 2-3 ml, and change solvent

into 10 ml n-hexane which further reduce to approximately 1-2 ml. A 2:1 alumina/silica gel

column with anhydrous sodium sulfate overlaying the alumina (remove small quantities of

water) was used to fractioned the extract. The first fraction, corresponding to aliphatic

hydrocarbons, was eluted with 15 ml of n-hexane. The second fraction, containing PAH

compounds, were collected by eluting 30 ml of n-hexane/dichloromethane (1:1, v:v). The

two fractions are combined for analysis. Sample extract was reduced to 1 ml and further to

0.2 ml with a gentle purified nitrogen stream. A known quantity (2 mg/ml) of the internal

standard, hexamethylbenzene, was added prior to GC-MS. The determination of two

hydrocarbons fraction was performed on a GC analyses were carried using an Agilent

Network GC system, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass

selective detector (MSD 5973) with electron impact ionization (EI) operating at 70 eV

(Agilent Technologies). A VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 µm

film thickness) was used for analytes separation. The GC–MS conditions for sample analysis

were as follows: the injection was performed manual in the splitless mode, at transfer-line

and injector temperature maintained at 300 ºC, and ion source at 230 ºC. Helium was used as

carrier gas at a flow of 1.3 ml min-1. Initial oven temperature was 60ºC, then ramped to 200

ºC at 10 ºC min-1, followed by another ramp step to 300 ºC at a rate of 5º C min_1, and held

for 8 min. The electron impact ionization mode conditions were at ion energy 70 eV. The

mass scanning ranged between m/? 20 and m/? 500.

Before sample analysis, a standard mixture and a procedural blank were run in

sequence to check for contamination, peak identification and quantification. The

concentration of the 16 US EPA priority PAHs was done by using an internal standard

mixture (Supelco) peaks area method. To quantify the aliphatic hydrocarbons fraction two

internal standards were used: undecane (n-C11H24) and tetracosane (n-C24H50). Deutorated

PAH surrogate standard were added to sediment samples to monitor the procedures of

sample extraction, cleanup and analysis. The surrogate recoveries added to sediment samples

were 72 ± 15% for naphthalene-d8 (n = 20), 73 ± 15% for acenaphthene-d10 (n = 20), 89 ±

20% for phenanthrene-d10 (n = 20), 86 ± 18% for chrysene-d12 (n = 20) and 86 ± 18% for

perylene-d10 (n = 20).

Water acidification

The pH was manipulated by bubbling CO2 into the water. The CO2 addition was

controlled with a feedback system that included a combination of pH electrode with a

controller (V² control pH controller, Tropical Marine Centre, UK) and a pressure regulator

with a integrated solenoid valve (V2 pressure regulator pro, Tropical Marine Centre, UK).

The controller allowed the visual representation of the actual pH. The acidified reservoir

thank was monitored with a pH electrode and the controller opened the valve when the pH

was lower than the set value. CO2 was then delivered until return of the pH to the pre-set

level. The acidified water was supplied to the microcosms in each high tide. In the

stabilization period, the pH in the acidified reservoir thank was gradually decreased 0.19

units every two days, until a pH of 7.2. The microcosms were then stabilized for 10 more

days until the oil contamination.  The pH was monitored in the acidified and control

microcosm with a calibrated pH meter (Orion Star portable meter, Thermo Fisher Scientific

Inc, USA) (Figure S IV-3) before each low tide. The average pH in the control microcosms

was 7.95 ±0.07 and in the acidified microcosms was 7.67±0.07.

Lighting system

The artificial life support system was equipped with 4 custom-made ReefSET®

programmable luminaire systems for diurnal light cycle and controlled UV-B simulation.

Each luminaire holds 4 UV-B fluorescent tubes (SolarRaptor, T5/54W, Germany) and 4 full

spectrum fluorescent tubes (AquaLight, T5/54W/10000K, Germany) disposed alternately

under a reflector. The luminaire system incorporates dimming ballast that allows the

adjustment of light intensity by varying the voltage supply. The ReefSET® proprietary

software enables the simulation of several scenarios by varying the percentage of light

intensity (http://www.reefset.com). Because during summer months (JJA) the day length

varies between ~13 and ~15 h at Portuguese latitudes, a 14 h diurnal light cycle was

simulated with light intensity varying from 50% to 100% of the total fluorescent tube

intensity (Table S IV-1). With the lamps set to 100% the photosynthetic active radiation

(PAR: 400-700 nm) was 260.5±56.3 ?mol photons m-2 s-1 (PAR spectrum - Figure S IV-1.A).

Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (µmol photons m-2 s-1) was measured with a Quantum

Meter with a separate sensor (Model MQ-200, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA). The

spectrum of photosynthetic active radiation was acquired using a USB2000

spectroradiometer, with spectral resolution of 0.38 nm (USB2000-VISNIR, grating #3,

Ocean Optics, Duiven, Netherlands) and a 400 µm diameter optic fiber (QP400-2-

VIS/NIR-BX, Ocean Optics).

Two UV-B conditions were implemented in the microcosm ensemble: microcosms

irradiated with UV-B and microcosms were the UV-B was screened out. In the microcosms

with UV-B, a constant UV-B irradiance of 1426.36±93.32 mW m-2, during 4 h per day

around noontime, was used. This irradiance corresponds to 50% of the maximum intensity

of the UV-B lamps (Table S IV-1). UV-B and UV-A spectra are represented in Figure S IV-

1.C. The values of the UV-B irradiance and time exposure were chosen considering the

action spectrum for generalized DNA-damage shown in Figure S IV-1.B, which was

parametrized by Bernard and Seckmeyer (1997). To find the adequate values, we proceeded

as follows: First, the effective DNA-damage UV intensity of the lamps was calculated

multiplying the spectrum of Figure S IV-1.C by the weighting function in 1.B and integrating

over all spectral range. Next, the typical DNA-damage UV dose observed at Lisbon, in June,

was calculated using the observed DNA-damage UV doses available at the Web page of

TEMIS (Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service at http://www.temis.nl/).

128

TEMIS is part of the Data User Programme (DUP) of the European Space Agency (ESA).

Finally, the irradiation duration, in order to have the microcosms exposed to a DNA-damage

UV dose similar to the observed one, was calculated dividing the typical DNA-damage UV

dose, observed at Lisbon, by the effective DNA-damage UV intensity of the lamps.

To have microcosms without UV-B radiation and maintain UV-A radiation we used

a glass filter. The spectrum of the UV filtered radiation is also shown in Figure S IV-1.C.

Comparing Figures S IV-1.B and S IV-1.C, it may be seen that the glass filter removed

practically all UV radiation with DNA-Damage effect, allowing comparable irradiances at the

longer wavelengths of the UV-A, except for the line centered at 365 nm. All the treatments

received a similar amount of integrated UV-A irradiance of 2875.91±264.62 mW m-2. UV-A

and UV-B irradiances were accessed with a spectro-radiometer, place at the minimum tide

level (35 cm from the lamps), connected to a monochromator that provides information on

the spectral irradiance with a resolution of one nanometer. Spectral irradiance was obtained

by the BenWin+ Software (Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK) (Ribeiro et al., 2011).

Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, PAR and UV spectra were measured under each

luminaire in minimum tide high in the middle and border microcosms.

CHAPTER V
Discussion and conclusions

Experimental design and methodological considerations

From field work to microcosm experiments

This work describes bacteria interactions with oil hydrocarbons (OH) in two distinct

environments and under future climate change scenarios. The SML was initially chosen as a

model environment due to: a) the enrichment of a wide range of pollutants, including OH,

that can be found in this particular compartment of the water column (Wurl et al., 2004); and

b) the lack of existing studies that specifically focused on the SML hydrocarbonoclastic

bacterial communities. The mesotidal costal lagoon Ria de Aveiro was chosen to perform this

study since due to an intense commercial shipping activity it is subject to a continuous efflux

of OH, making it suitable to study the responses of bacterioneuston community structure to

OH. The collecting points were selected in order to reflect a gradient of oil pollution,

extending from the outer section of the estuary to the inner section of canal de Ílhavo.

However, this selection is not absent of criticism since the collecting points are also subject to

other sources of organic contamination rather than oil, making difficult to access the

independent effect of OH pollution.

The difficulty in isolating experimental variables and establishing cause-effect

relationships in field studies is a problem not only in microbial ecology studies but also in

ecology in general (Jessup et al., 2004, Benton et al., 2007). This justified the development of an

experimental life support system that allows high control microcosm experiments designed to

study the interactions of bacterial communities and OH under climate change scenarios. The

advantages and disadvantages of using small-scale experiments and the development of the

microcosm framework are described in chapters I and III, respectively. The logical step after

the exploratory study on the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterioneuston community would have

been to test several climate change scenarios in the SML. However, simulating the formation

of a stable bacterioneuston community in the ELSS with a minimum of realism appeared as a

complex task. Even under environmental conditions, the establishment and structure of a

complex SML bacterial community is still a poorly understood phenomenon (Cunliffe et al.,

2011) that can be affected by several factors such as strong water currents (Santos et al., 2011).



Discussion and conclusions

142

Nonetheless, the simulation of the SML with this system is possible in principle, although

additional system optimization efforts would be required. Therefore, the experimental design

focused on the microbial community of sediments retrieve from the shallow coastal lagoon

Ria de Aveiro.

Shallow estuarine areas provide crucial ecosystem functions. However, the

consequences of climate changes and anthropogenic contaminants, such as OH, in these areas

remain largely unknown. Since key ecosystem functions in shallow-water sediments are mainly

controlled by microorganisms, it is important to understand the effects of these multiple

stressors on these communities (Alsterberg et al., 2011).

Considerations on climate change and oil spill microcosms experiment

Some important guidelines were followed when programming the experiment: a) the

experiment should simulate global change scenarios within the limits established by available

models; b) the sediment should be stabilized in the microcosms before the oil introduction; c)

the experiment should operate during a reasonable time; d) the microcosms should simulate a

shallow environment; e) sediment should be collected intact in the field, in order to preserve

its aerobic (~1 cm of top sediment) and anaerobic layers (~10 cm of top sediment); f)

sediment sampling within the microcosm should be keep to minimum to avoid microcosm

perturbation during the experiment. The acidification of the synthetic water was accomplished

by bubbling CO2 into the water. This method is described as an efficient way of manipulating

carbonate chemistry in seawater (Gattuso et al., 2009). The lowest average pH was 7.65±0.67

in the acidified microcosms and 7.97±0.07 in the control microcosms, representing a pH

decrease of approximately 0.3. This value falls within 0.3-0.4 pH reduction modeled for the

ocean surface by the end of this century (Caldeira et al., 2003).

Two limitations of UV-B simulation were taken into consideration. First, the spectral

irradiance emitted by UV lamps does not match the solar irradiance. UV lamps emit more

short-wave and less long-wave UV-B than the sun (Xu et al., 2010). Since the biological and

chemical effects of UVR are wavelength dependent (Rundel, 1983, Santos et al., 2013) a

description of wavelength dependency is necessary to simulate increasing UVR scenarios with

some degree of realism. Thus, a biological spectral weighting function that describes the

effectiveness of the lamp wavelength to produce biological responses is needed to calculate

the effective biological UV-B (Andreasson et al., 2006). Second, unlike the effect of increasing

143

atmospheric CO2 on ocean pH, there is no available information on how the amount of

ultraviolet radiation that reaches the water surface will vary in the next century. Although

interactions between climate change and stratospheric ozone have the potential to impact

future levels of ambient UVR (Thomas et al., 2012, UNEP, 2012, UNEP, 2010), developing

models that simulate and can predict future UVR levels requires a broad range of inputs,

making this a complex task (Thomas et al., 2012).

In order to address the first limitation, the values of the UV-B irradiance and time of

exposure where considered using the action spectrum for generalized DNA-damage

parameterized by Bernard and Seckmeyer (1997). In the absence of available models of future

UV-B, it was chosen to implement two conditions in the system: microcosms irradiated with

UV-B and microcosms where the UV-B was screened out. The typical DNA-damage UV dose

observed at Lisbon, in June, was implemented in microcosms irradiated with UV-B. A similar

amount of UV-A integrated irradiance was also supplemented to all microcosms (including

non UV-B treated) since UV-A radiation is practically unaffected by changes in ozone

depletion and plays an important role in photo-repair mechanisms (Bargagli, 2005). Complete

description of the system and procedures can be found in chapters III and IV.

The experimental life support system operated during 21 days before the addition of

oil in order to allow microbial communities to stabilize under microcosm conditions. During

this period, microcosms were gradually acidified until they reached the target pH. The

microcosms were kept at the experimental irradiance from day 1. After the oil spill the system

operated during 36 days more, in a total of 57 days. The duration of the experiment was

established taking into consideration the previous knowledge on microbial dynamics when

exposed to oil contamination and the necessary logistics to maintain the experiment. It is well

established that microbial community structure can change significantly when exposed to oil

hydrocarbon, favoring groups that can use oil hydrocarbons as carbon and energy source

(Gomes et al., 2005, Yakimov et al., 2005). Therefore, possible interactive effects of oil, UVR

and ocean acidification on microbial community structure could be masked by initial changes

due to oil exposure. It is plausible to speculate that potential interactions would only emerge

after an initial period. On the other hand, although the ELSS can be set to function by only

two operators working in shifts, its functioning requires considerable amounts of water and

synthetic salt. The ELSS consumed approximately 96 l of water and 3.3 kg of salt per day of

operation. Thus a compromise between these two important factors had to be made and the

system operated during 57 days.



Discussion and conclusions

144

Water renewal between tides at the original site from where the sediment was collected

is almost 100%. However, since one of the experiment guidelines was to simulate a shallow

environment, the microcosms were programmed to simulate a 50% water renewal between

tides, similar to that estimated for the central area of the estuary (Dias et al., 2001). Therefore,

the sediments in the microcosms were exposed to more anoxic conditions than in their natural

environment. These conditions introduced a changing in the original microbial community,

favoring anaerobic groups. The relative abundance of Desulfobacterales which mainly includes

anaerobic bacteria, clearly increased under microcosm conditions. This was not the only

change in the microbial community. Although the dominant groups present in the

environment were also detected in the microcosms, the microcosm conditions caused a

decrease in rare groups. It can be argued that the microcosms failed to fully reproduce the

original community detected in the environment. However, the goal of the experiment was

not to reproduce with detail the original communities but rather to sustain a microbial

community that preserved some of their original structural and functional characteristics.

Importantly, water inorganic analysis and stress indicators of the model organisms Hediste

diversicolor suggested that the changes in the microbial community structure did not affect the

microcosm artificial ecosystem.

Microbial communities and oil hydrocarbon degradation in estuarine environments –
main conclusions and unanswered questions

In this study, Pseudomonas emerged as a representative genus within the hydrocarbon

degrading bacteria in the SML. The ability of Pseudomonads to degrade OH and their role in

bioengineered remediation strategies is not new (Menn et al., 2008). However, this was the first

time that hydrocarbon-degrading isolates were obtained from the SML. As referred, the SML

is the first water compartment to be in contact with OH pollutants after major oil spills.

Therefore, Pseudomonas isolates adapted to this layer can be ideal targets for engineer or

promote (through biostimulation strategies) during oil spills. Two important aspects arise

from this work. The first refers to the pattern of variation along the oil gradient observed in

Pseudomonas DGGE profile. Due to the role of Pseudomonas in organic matter degradation these

patterns can imply a potential functional change that should be explored in future studies. A

metatranscriptomic approach could be used to characterize the expression of genes related to

organic matter and OH degradation in this layer. The second aspect is the evidence of



Discussion and conclusions

145

horizontal gene transference between different bacterial isolates. Horizontal gene transfer is a

rapid mechanism that microorganisms use to share OH degrading genes when facing a sudden

input of OH (American Academy of Microbiology, 2011). Future work should focus on this

process that can be determinant in the capacity of bacterial communities to degrade oil in

contaminated environments.

The microcosm experiment demonstrated that the impact of an oil spill in the active

bacterial communities capable of degrading oil will be substantially different in future ocean

pH levels. Desulfobacterales order relative abundance decreased drastically after the oil spill

simulation under reduced ocean pH when compared to normal pH. Moreover, a significant

change in predicted genes associated with several OH degradation pathways was also detected,

confirming that the observed changes in Desulfobacterales will probably have functional

consequences in OH degradation. Anaerobic degradation of oil hydrocarbons by

microorganisms in marine sediments reduces toxic hydrocarbons (Rothermich et al., 2002).

Therefore, a drastic reduction in Desulfobacterales could significantly change the capacity of

coastal and estuarine systems to degrade OH with widespread consequences in higher trophic

levels. Importantly, the pH reduction simulated in this study is probably the best-case scenario

for coastal and estuarine environments. Increased eutrophication in these areas will exacerbate

the effect of ocean acidification due to the development of hypoxic and anoxic zones

(Howarth et al., 2011). Interestingly, a moderate level of UV-B appears to attenuate these

effects probably because of photochemistry modifications of OH. Therefore, it is likely that

the magnitude of these interactions and their effects will depend on the level of UV-B that

penetrates the impacted ecosystem. Future work must be done to unravel the mechanisms

that underlie the associated changes to clarify the drastic decrease of Desulfobacterales and the

toxicity of oil degradation products under these conditions. Other observed shifts in the

structure of microbial communities should also be the focus of future research. A significant

increase of Methylococcales in oil contaminated sediment under reduced pH and UV-B was also

registered. Methanotrophic bacteria may act as an important biofilter that limits the release of

CH4 to the atmosphere, and therefore the ecological relevance of the observed trends should

also be accessed in future studies.

Ecology and Evolution

Abstract: Global climate change has the potential to seriously and adversely affect marine ecosystem
functioning. Numerous experimental and modelling studies have demonstrated how predicted ocean acidification

and increased ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can affect marine microbes. However, researchers have largely ignored

interactions between ocean acidification, increased ultraviolet radiation and anthropogenic pollutants in marine

environments. Such interactions can alter chemical speciation and the bioavailability of several organic and

inorganic pollutants with potentially deleterious effects, such as modifying microbial mediated detoxification

processes. Microbes mediate major biogeochemical cycles, providing fundamental ecosystems services such as

environmental detoxification and recovery. It is, therefore, important to understand how predicted changes to

oceanic pH, UVR and temperature will affect microbial pollutant detoxification processes in marine ecosystems.

The intrinsic characteristics of microbes, such as their short generation time, small size and functional role in

biogeochemical cycles combined with recent advances in molecular techniques (e.g., metagenomics and

metatranscriptomics) make microbes excellent models to evaluate the consequences of various climate change

scenarios on detoxification processes in marine ecosystems. In this review, we highlight the importance of

microbial microcosm experiments, coupled with high-resolution molecular biology techniques, to provide a

critical experimental framework to start understanding how climate change, anthropogenic pollution and

microbiological interactions may affect marine ecosystems in the future.

Introduction

Anthropogenic concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased from

approximately 280 ppm (parts per million) in preindustrial times (Indermühle et al., 1999) to

nearly 394 ppm in 2012 (NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, 2012). Levels of CO2 in

the atmosphere now exceed limits considered natural for most animals and plants (Ehleringer

et al., 2002). The best known postulated consequence of an increasing atmospheric CO2
concentration is global warming, which may, among other things, lead to sea level changes,

promote ocean stratification, and alter the sea-ice extent and patterns of ocean circulation

(Doney et al., 2012). In addition to the above, increased atmospheric CO2 will also lead to a

net air-to-sea flux of CO2, thereby reducing seawater pH and modifying the chemical balance

among inorganic carbon species. This process, known as ocean acidification, is often referred

to as “the other CO2 problem” (Henderson, 2006). In contrast to other climate change

scenarios, ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increased atmospheric CO2 and does

not depend on uncertainties related to other climate change predictions (Doney et al., 2009).

Although international treaties have been effective in reducing atmospheric

concentrations of ozone depleting substances, increased greenhouse gas concentrations have

the potential to affect the spatial distribution of ozone and its exchange between the

stratosphere and the troposphere; this, in turn, will influence ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels

reaching the Earth’s surface (UNEP, 2010, UNEP, 2012). Higher UVR levels have also been

shown to disrupt aquatic food webs and reduce the biological sinking capacity of aquatic

environments for atmospheric CO2 (Hader et al., 2007, Fabry et al., 2008).

In addition to the effects of anthropogenic activities on global climate change, fossil

fuel combustion, fertilizer use, and industrial activity have adversely affected coastal and open-

ocean environments for decades, providing a continuous influx of pollutants [including oil

hydrocarbons (OH), pesticides and heavy metals] into these ecosystems (Doney, 2010). With

respect to OH, natural seepage alone introduces about 6×105 metric tons year-1 of crude-oil to

oceans, representing c. 47% of crude oil entering the marine environment. The remaining

53%, results from anthropogenic activities (accidental oil spills, transport activities, refining,

storage, and others) (Kvenvolden et al., 2003). Among scientists, there is a growing awareness

that ocean acidification and increased UVR have the potential to alter contaminant transfer in

aquatic food webs, and modify the structure of aquatic trophic webs and that the

biomagnification of contaminants may lead to increased toxicity in marine ecosystems

(Pelletier et al., 2006, Fabry et al., 2008).

Microbial communities play a central role in the global recycling of pollutants. For

example, the oil-catabolic versatility of microbes, particularly bacteria, ensures that oceans are

not completely covered with an oil film (Head et al., 2006). Despite the importance of

microbes in the process of global recycling of anthropogenic pollutants, the potential

interactions of ocean acidification, UVR, anthropogenic pollutants and marine microbial

communities have been largely ignored. Little is known about how ocean acidification and

increased UVR can interact with anthropogenic pollutants will affect microbial communities

and biogeochemical cycling.



Appendix

153

Moreover, although ocean acidification and increased UVR have the potential to affect

microbial assemblages (Riebesell et al., 2007, Santos et al., 2012b, Liu et al., 2010), very little is

known about the effects on microbial mediated pollutant detoxification and how this will

impact pollutant pathways (Figure A-1).

The aim of this review is to present the recent advances in our understanding of the

consequences of interactions between ocean acidification, increased UVR, anthropogenic

pollutants and marine microbial communities. Recent technological advances in molecular

microbiology as a means to improving our ability to study potential interactive effects are also

discussed.

Ocean acidification and UVR interactions with marine microbial communities – what
we know so far

If CO2 emissions continue unabated, oceanic pH will decline 0.3 to 0.4 units by the

end of this century, and up to 0.7 units in 2300 (Caldeira et al., 2003). When CO2 dissolves in

seawater, carbonic acid (H2CO3) is formed and quickly dissociates into hydrogen (H
+) and

communities. Climate change has the potential to influence pollutant toxicity by acting directly on pollutant

chemistry or indirectly by affecting microbial mediated detoxification.

bicarbonate (HCO3
-) ions. A hydrogen ion can then react with a carbonate ion (CO3

-2) to form

bicarbonate. This process leads to increased partial pressure (pCO2), increased concentrations

of H2CO3, HCO
-
3, and H

+, and reduced concentrations of CO3
-2 (Fabry et al., 2008). These

changes in carbonate chemistry have serious implications for marine organisms that depend

on minerals such as calcite and aragonite to produce shells and skeletons (e.g., corals, mollusks,

echinoderms and crustaceans). Indeed, the available data suggests that calcification rates will

be affected under future pCO2 scenarios (Fabry et al., 2008).

A key question is how microbial communities and microbial mediated biogeochemical

processes will be affected by ocean acidification. Joint et al. (2011) recently argued that given

that microbial assemblages have always experienced variable pH conditions, the appropriate

null hypothesis to be tested is that “there will be no catastrophic changes in marine

biogeochemical processes driven by phytoplankton, bacteria and archaea”. In response to this

article, Liu et al. (2010), performed a meta-analysis of published data and suggested that

changes in microbial structure and function are possible. Both authors provide valid

arguments to a complex issue that we have only just started to understand. So far, existing

studies suggest that microbial mediated processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycles may be

affected. For example, Riebesell et al. (2007) showed that a phytoplankton community

responded to higher CO2 concentrations (three times the present pCO2 conditions) in

seawater by an up to 39% increase in net primary production. Increased pCO2 may also impact

the nitrogen cycle. The filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium, a major contributor of new

nitrogen in oligotrophic oceans, has been shown to increase carbon and nitrogen fixation rates

by 35 to 100% at pCO2 levels predicted for 2100 (Hutchins et al., 2007). In addition to

nitrogen fixation, other components of the nitrogen cycle may also be altered by ocean

acidification. Nitrification can be affected by pH driven changes in the availability of ammonia

(NH3). Beman et al. (2010) suggest that a reduction in nitrification rates of 3-44% can occur

within a few decades. With respect to bacterial communities there is little information and the

existing studies are less clear. Most of the studies regarding bacteria under ocean acidification

scenarios have been performed in large pelagic mesocosm systems that study the effect of

carbonate chemistry modifications through the food web. These experiments are capable of

realistic simulations where indirect effects from interactions with phytoplankton can be

studied. Experiments such as these have demonstrated that bacterial abundance and activity

can vary due to phytoplankton shifts under high pCO2 (Grossart et al., 2003, Allgaier et al.,

2008). Regarding community structure, large mesocosms and small-scale approaches have



Appendix

155

revealed contrasting effects. In large pelagic mesocosms dominant bacterial community shifts

were not related to pCO2 (Roy et al., 2012), whereas in small microcosm systems, pH levels

predicted for the year 2100 had a significant impact on bacterial structure (Krause et al., 2012).

It is clear that we still have much to learn about microbial dynamics under elevated

pCO2 levels, particularly with respect to the underlying mechanisms that trigger some of the

observed trends. Furthermore, the impact of ocean acidification on microbial function needs

to be addressed with more focus on local or regional conditions, since the magnitude of

carbonate changes will vary across regions. For example, anthropogenic stressors exacerbate

ocean acidification through the development of hypoxic and anoxic zones due to increased

eutrophication in coastal and estuarine areas. Low oxygen waters are more acidic than ocean

waters. In a model saline estuary the development of hypoxia is enough to reduce pH levels by

more than 0.5 units (Howarth et al., 2011).

Effects of UVR in marine microbial communities

Researchers have studied the effects of UVR for some decades. An important impetus

for studying UVR was the concern for the ozone layer, which had been adversely affected by

chlorofluorocarbons. Following implementation of the Montreal protocol that placed

restrictions on ozone-depleting substances, ozone levels in the atmosphere are no longer

declining (McKenzie et al., 2011). However, recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer to 1980’s

levels is not likely to occur in the next decades (Weatherhead et al., 2006). In fact, the area of

the Antarctica ozone hole reached a maximum in 2006 (Nasa, 2009) and in 2011 a record

destruction of the ozone layer over the Arctic was reported (Manney et al., 2011). Therefore,

changes in UV radiation levels in the future will depend on changes in various atmospheric

factors, besides total ozone, including clouds, aerosols, as well as surface reflectivity (or

albedo), in some locations. Other factors, including tropospheric gaseous pollutants and

stratospheric temperature, may also play a role (WMO, 2010). Due to the complexity of

factors influencing changes in UV radiation levels reaching the Earth’s surface, future trends

in UV radiation levels are uncertain and contrasting predictions exist. For example, while

some prediction models indicate that by the 2090’s mean erythemal UV levels will drop by up

to 12% worldwide compared to values recorded in 1980 (Bais et al., 2011), other models

indicate that UV-B levels will increased in the Northern Hemisphere in response to reductions

in the amount of aerosols and clouds (Hegglin et al., 2009, Watanabe et al., 2011).

It is well known that the amount of UVR that reaches the earth’s surface has

important consequences for aquatic ecosystems. UVR is the most photochemically reactive

waveband of incident solar radiation and can have genotoxic, cytotoxic and ontogenetic

effects on aquatic organisms (Bancroft et al., 2007). It is commonly divided into three

wavelength ranges: UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (290-320 nm), and UV-C (&lt;290 nm). DNA
absorbs only weakly at longer UV wavelengths (Jones et al., 1987). Thus, the biological effects

of UV-A are usually considered to be indirect, resulting from intracellular generation of

reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA (Pattison et al.,

2006). UV-C wavelengths are generally not deemed to be environmentally relevant, given that

they are almost completely screened out of the atmosphere by oxygen and ozone. UV-B is the

highest energy wavelength of solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface and the UV

wavelength mostly affected by shifts in the ozone layer (Andersen et al., 2002). UV-B radiation

can cause damage to nearly all biomolecules by direct absorption or indirectly as a result of

enhanced formation of ROS (Vincent et al., 2000).

Environmental effects of UVR radiation are generally attenuated by protective

strategies displayed by living organisms, such as avoidance, photochemical quenching and

repair. The overall stress imposed by UVR exposure thus reflects a balance between damage,

repair and the energetic costs of protection, while it may also affect energy consumption and

the biochemical composition of cellular material, resulting in lower survival and growth rates

(Vincent et al., 2000). UVR represents an important stressor for bacteria in aquatic ecosystems,

as their simple haploid genomes provide little or no functional redundancy (Garcia-Pichel,

1994). In general, exposure to UV-B reduces extracellular enzymatic activities (Herndl et al.,

1993, Santos et al., 2012), oxygen consumption (Joux et al., 2009) and leucine and thymidine

incorporation (Sommaruga et al., 1997, Santos et al., 2012). Different bacterial groups have also

been shown to vary in their sensitivity to UVR and the potential to repair UVR induced

damage (Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006, Santos et al., 2012). Gammaproteobacteria have been

identified as the most UV-resistant group in several aquatic environments (Santos et al., 2012,

Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006, Ordoñez et al., 2009). Field studies have also identified the Bacteroidetes

group as UV resistant (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006, Fernández Zenoff et al., 2006). The

Alphaproteobacteria group, on the other hand, has been reported to be UV-sensitive (Alonso-

Sáez et al., 2006). Among Alphaproteobacteria, the SAR11 cluster, which is potentially the most

abundant and ubiquitous clade of heterotrophic marine bacteria in the oceans (Morris et al.,

2002a) were found to be particularly sensitive to solar UVR (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2006, Ruiz-



Appendix

157

González et al., 2012). High UVR sensitivity of SAR11 was attributed to the high A+T content

(69%) reported for the genome of the representative member of this group, Pelagibacter ubique

(Giovannoni et al., 2005b). The UV sensitivity of the SAR11 group is also supported by recent

observations of the disappearance of sequences affiliated to Pelagibacter in natural Patagonian

bacterioplankton communities following an 8-day exposure to PAR, PAR+UV-A and

PAR+UV-A+UV-B (Manrique et al., 2012). Other studies, however, indicate stimulation of

SAR11 activity by light, potentially associated with the presence of proteorhodopsins

(Giovannoni et al., 2005a, Lami et al., 2009, Mary et al., 2008). Further studies are necessary to

elucidate how environmental factors, particularly UVR, affect SAR11 diversity and activity.

The differential sensitivity to UVR exhibited by the most abundant bacterial groups

present in the bacterioplankton is of paramount importance for the biogeochemical impact of

enhanced UVR on ecosystems. The rationale for this assumption is the contrasting activity

displayed by different groups of bacteria on the utilization of DOM (Cottrell et al., 2000). For

example, UVR-sensitive Alphaproteobacteria populations seem to be responsible for a large part

of low-molecular-weight DOM uptake, while the more UVR-resistant Bacteroidetes, tend

specialize in high-molecular-weight DOM uptake (Cottrell et al., 2000, Alonso-Sáez et al.,

2006). Therefore, changes in bacterial community structure triggered by increased UV-B levels

may promote dramatic shifts in DOM pathways (Morris et al., 2002b).

Synergistic effect of UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants

Will interactions between UVR, ocean acidification and anthropogenic pollutants affect marine microbes?

Despite the fact that several studies have shown that environmental, physical, and

chemical parameters directly affect the toxicity of anthropogenic pollutants, the interactive

effects of UVR and ocean acidification on the chemistry of these pollutants and their effects

on marine microbial communities have received very little attention. Increased UVR levels and

changes to ocean pH will certainly affect the chemistry of several natural compounds and

environmental pollutants, thus altering the way that they will interact with marine organisms.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), one of the most common compounds associated to

OH pollution, are ideal examples of photoactive contaminants that are strongly absorbed in

the UV-A and UV-B spectral regions. It is known that PAH toxicity to marine organisms may

increase with exposure to UVR. This increase is largely regulated by two processes: namely,



Appendix

158

photosensitization and photooxidation reactions. Both of these processes have the potential

to release phototoxic aromatic hydrocarbons into the environment, which are more toxic than

their parent compounds (Krylov et al., 1997).

Reduced oceanic pH has the potential to affect the adsorption of metals by organic

particles. Generally, organic particles are negatively charged and, as pH declines, surface sites

become less available to adsorb positive ions like metals (Millero et al., 2009). This aspect is

particularly important due to the fact that more than 99% of the total concentration of most

metals in seawater corresponds to organic complexes (Millero et al., 2009). Small deviations in

the concentration of elements such as Cu and Cd can have a serious effect on the health of

marine organisms (Millero et al., 2009). Organic materials though are often nonhomogeneous

and of unknown structure. It is essential that we gain a better understanding of metal

speciation in organic complexes (Millero et al., 2009, Doney et al., 2009).

A key question is whether there is any evidence of an interaction between UVR and

ocean acidification, on one hand and anthropogenic pollutants on the other. The answer is

yes, although several details are missing and require further research. Photoenhanced toxicity

of PAH due to UVR exposure has already been observed in a variety of organisms. On crab

larvae no significant effect of PAH and UVR exposure was detected on larval crab mortality

after independent exposure but the combined effect of both, resulted in up to 100% mortality,

(Peachey, 2005). This phenomenon has also been verified in isolated bacterial strains

(McConkey et al., 1997), although only a few studies have addressed the effect of UVR photo-

modified pollutants in complex microbial assemblages (Pelletier et al., 2006, Petersen et al.,

2008). In a microcosm experiment designed to study the effects of increased UV-B in the

presence of the water soluble fraction of crude oil, an increase in mortality was observed in

the phytoplankton community exposed to UV-B. In this scenario, the toxic effects on

phytoplankton led to a release of carbon and other nutrients that stimulated bacterial growth

(Pelletier et al., 2006). A similar effect was reported in sediment microcosms (Petersen et al.,

where algal 14C-incorporation and chlorophyll a content both declined in sediments exposed

to UV-light and pyrene. At the same time, oxygen consumption and the release of N and P

increased, suggesting an increase in bacterial activity (Petersen et al., 2008).

It has been suggested that altered water CO2 chemistry in combination with other

environmental stressors may modify the responses of organisms, and even ecosystems, to

these stressors in ways that differ substantially from the action of only a single stressor (Fabry

et al. 2008). Indeed, ocean acidification in combination with elevated nutrient inputs can



Appendix

159

accelerate the expansion of filamentous turfs at the expense of calcifying algae in a synergistic

response 34% greater than the sum of their individual effects (Russell et al., 2009). Recently, it

was reported that DNA damage in amphipods was 2.7 times higher in metal contaminated

sediment under an increase pCO2 (750 ?atm) scenario (Roberts et al., 2012). However, nothing

is known about possible changes in the response of marine microbes to anthropogenic

pollutants under increased pCO2 scenarios.

Generally, very little is known about the potential interactions (antagonistic, additive,

or synergistic) between different pollutants. Although it lies outside the scope of this review,

this topic is important given that marine ecosystems are exposed to a myriad of novel

chemical substances that can react in unexpected ways (Crain et al., 2008).

Microbial mediated detoxification

An important question to be addressed is whether the effects of ocean acidification

and UVR will affect microbial communities in such a way that it may alter microbial mediated

detoxification of anthropogenic pollutants. In addition to directly measurable physiological

effects on marine microbes, UVR and ocean acidification can also indirectly affect the toxicity

of anthropogenic pollutants by inducing shifts in microbial community structure; they can also

alter microbial mediated detoxification processes. For example, the bioavailability of inorganic

nutrients required for bacterial growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is a key factor in

successful ecosystem detoxification of PAH (Atlas et al., 1972). Anything that alters the

nitrogen cycle, such as ocean acidification has the potential to alter microbial mediated PAH

detoxification processes and consequently PAH toxicity.

A critical potential effect of ocean acidification is an alteration of metal bioavailability.

Metals interact with microbes in various ways, and are involved in virtually all aspects of

microbial growth and metabolism (Gadd, 2010). Changes in iron chemistry are particularly

important, given that iron is a limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton in large oceanic

regions (Sunda et al., 2010). The pCO2 values predicted for the year 2100 would reduce iron

uptake by diatoms and coccolithophores by 10 to 20% (Shi et al., 2010). The reduction in iron

availability is believed to be related to pH induced binding of iron to organic ligands, thus

reducing biologically available Fe(III) (Shi et al., 2010; Sunda, 2010). The net effect of ocean

acidification on iron chemistry is still unclear. For example, although lower pH also increases

iron binding to organic ligands, the solubility of Fe(III) increases with water acidification in



Appendix

160

surface ocean waters (Figure A-2) (Millero et al., 2009). Changes in iron bioavailability due to

ocean acidification have, therefore, potentially harmful effects (Shi et al., 2010). Iron is also an

important factor in the detoxification of hydrocarbons, by influencing the activity of enzymes

that catalyze the oxidative breakdown of PAH (Dinkla et al., 2001, Santos et al., 2008).

Monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes, essential in most microbial PAH degradation

pathways, require a metal cofactor which is often iron (Bugg, 2003). The activity of several key

enzymes, including toluene monooxygenase, in the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbon

toluene by Pseudomonas putida, was found to be reduced under iron limiting conditions (Dinkla

et al., 2001). The complexity of biological, chemical and environmental interactions in natural

environments restricts our ability to establish cause-effect relationships. Understanding the

interactive effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollutants on microbial communities

is a complex task. It requires the study of a multitude of chemical and biological pathways,

which may only be experimentally addressed in detail under controlled conditions.

decrease modelled by Caldeira and Wickett (2003), at 25ºC and salinity of 35. Adapted from Millero et al. (2009).

Since coastal and estuarine areas are very different between them, modeling on speciation of metals in these areas

is needed for a more complete and accurate scenarios.

It is important that we obtain a mechanistic understanding of the effects of ocean

acidification and UVR on pollutant toxicity and degradation. Pollution events, however, occur

over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales making it difficult to gauge cause-effect

relationships. This difficulty is enhanced when studying additional levels of complexity such as

interactive effects with different stressors. In such cases, small-scale models, such as micro-

and mesocosms, can be useful tools.

Micro- and mesocosms are simplified systems, constructed to mimic natural

environments under controlled conditions (Roeselers et al., 2006). Both simplified systems are

powerful tools that have facilitated the study of several ecological processes, including

research on predator-prey coevolution, ecosystem level-selection, resource competition and

adaptive radiation (Jessup et al., 2004). Both systems have advantages and disadvantages (Table

A-1). The major advantage of these setups is that they enable a high degree of experimental

control and replication. The level of control provided is virtually impossible to obtain through

standard field surveys (Benton et al., 2007). In addition to this, micro- and mesocosms enable

researchers to experiment with highly toxic substances that would not be possible in situ.

While there is some concern that these models are too small, both spatially and temporally, to

be useful, the goal of these experiments is not to fully reproduce nature in a laboratory model

system, but rather to simplify complex ecosystems so that essential dynamics can be captured

(Jessup et al., 2004). The distinction between micro- and mesocosms is somewhat arbitrary.

Mesocosms tend to be outdoor and larger in size, increasing biological and spatial complexity

(Petchey et al., 2002), but diminishing experimental control and reducing replicability. In

contrast, small microcosm setups allow a degree of experimental control and replication that is

difficult to achieve with larger outdoor mesocosms.

Table A-1: Main advantages and disadvantages of micro- and mesocosm experiments

Of course, the size and design of these experiments will always depend on the research

question. Research on potential interactions between climate change and anthropogenic

pollutants can greatly benefit from the experimental control of small microcosm systems.

Many field studies only provide correlative evidence of certain phenomena. Microcosm

experiments can help to elucidate whether there is an actual mechanistic effect. Additionally,

small-scale experiments with microbes can overcome microcosm scale related limitations

associated with studying larger organisms. Due to the small size and short generation times of

microbes, it is possible to simulate complex temporal and spatial scales within microcosms

(Jessup et al., 2004). Climate change interactions with anthropogenic pollutants could be tested

over several generations. For example, Collins and Bell (2006) simulated evolutionary

responses of Chlamydomonas populations exposed to increasing concentrations of CO2 using

microcosm experiments. Nevertheless, temporal and spatial scales should be considered with

care when performing experiments with microbes. Enclosure within small experimental

containers can induce shifts in microbial communities known as the “bottle effect” (Ferguson

et al., 1984). It is important to monitor microbial communities and determine the extent results

Currently, one of the key gaps in our understanding of how climate change may affect

microbial communities is the lack of microcosm systems designed to simulate predicted

scenarios in marine environments. For example, the effect of carbonate chemistry

manipulation on microbial communities has mainly been assessed in larger mesocosms.

Reliable microcosm systems designed to mimic fundamental dynamics of marine

environments and capable of simulating climate change scenarios are needed. However,

developing microcosm systems capable of simulating climate change scenarios such as

increase UVR or ocean acidification is not a trivial task. For example, the spectral irradiance

emitted by UVR lamps does not match natural solar irradiance. UVR lamps emit more short-

wave and less long-wave UVR than the sun (Xu et al., 2010). A possible solution is to calibrate

the lamps with a biological spectral weighting function that describes the effectiveness of lamp

wavelength to produce biological responses (Andreasson et al., 2006). However, this

experimental setup is complex for long term outdoor microcosm experiments since UVR

lamps must be continuously calibrated in order to account for daily and seasonal light

variation. If the experimental setup does not involve wavelength isolation, microcosms can be

directly exposed to sunlight. Recently, Gao et al. (2012) exposed microcosms directly to several

levels of solar radiation to simulate the synergistic effects of light exposure and increased

pCO2 in phytoplankton at different depths. Likewise, there are several methods that simulate

future changes in seawater chemistry. CO2 bubbling, addition of high-CO2 seawater and

combined addition of acid and HCO3- are the three approaches that most closely mimic future

scenarios of shifts in seawater chemistry (Gattuso et al., 2009). Probably, the easiest to

implement in microcosms is CO2 bubbling with pH stats systems. In these systems, pH is

monitored continuously and a controller valve increases or reduces the addition of CO2 when

pH deviates from a set value (Gattuso et al., 2009).

As referred to above, the use of microcosms to address fundamental ecological

questions is not new. However, this approach combined with recent advances in microbe

characterization technologies can provide an important framework to start unravelling how

climate change and pollution may interact to affect several levels of biological organization

(Figure A-3).

Figure A-3: Microbial microcosm couple with “omics” technologies can provide an excellent tool to gain
mechanistic insights into climate change and anthropogenic pollution interactive effects at several levels of

biological organization.

The recent development of molecular technologies has enabled scientists to assess the

structure and function of microbes in a range of different environments including soil,

sediment, water and within animal and plant hosts. The development of high-throughput

DNA sequencing technologies has been a milestones in the field of metagenomics and

metatranscriptomics. Metagenomic analysis, however, only provides structural and putative

functional information of the microbes under study. In order to restrict focus to the active (as

opposed to dormant, Urich et al. 2008) members of microbial communities and the genes

expressed, several protocols were developed to sequence actively transcribed RNA and

messenger RNA (mRNA) (also known as metatranscriptomics). Metatranscriptomic analysis

can facilitate the study of microbial responses to rapid environmental change (e.g. an oil spill),

thereby linking structural shifts to community function (Mason et al., 2012). In parallel,

advances in efficient chromatographic separation coupled with mass spectrophotometry-based

approaches have enabled high-throughput protein identification. The study of the entire set of

proteins (proteome) produced by a given microbial community in a particular environment

has led to a new field known as metaproteomics. Together with metagenomics and

metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics can facilitate the study of cellular responses to changing

environmental conditions. Metabolite profiling in complex biological samples is also an

emerging field. This new approach, known as metabolomics, involves the quantitative and

qualitative analysis of the complete set of metabolites present in a sample, providing additional

information on metabolic and physiological potential.

While these technologies have greatly improved our ability to acquire data, they have

also created new challenges. The current rapid development of “omic” technologies is unique

in that it actually exceeds the rate of chip performance evolution in the computing industry,

also known as Moore's law (Gilbert et al., 2012). However, our ability to integrate the large

amount of “omic” data is maturing rapidly. For example, the construction of co-occurrence

and correlation networks from presence-absence or abundance data, in a process know as

network inference, is being increasingly used to predict microbial interactions (Faust et al.,

2012). Recently, Larsen et al. (2012) used an artificial neural network to develop a model that

predicts the abundance of microbial taxa as a function of environmental conditions and

biological interactions. This method can be seen as a first step in the application of bioclimatic

modeling to predict microbial community and environmental interactions under future global

change scenarios.

Microcosm simulations must be developed in line with data acquisition from the field

and modeling. Microbial observatories that generate long-term data series from different

habitats and across several gradients (e.g., polluted versus non-polluted areas or areas of

volcanic activity where CO2 gas is released into the water creating a natural gradient of pH

levels (Hall-Spencer et al., 2008) can also provided valuable information on potential

interactive effects. Furthermore, data series such as these can be used to confirm or refute

hypotheses formulated from microcosm experiments.

Concluding remarks

Understanding the full extent of interactive effects of global climate change and

pollutants on microbes is a complex task, which entails the study of a multitude of

interactions. In addition to this, the information about these interactions is scarce and studies

in this field are still in their infancy. Further studies are needed to evaluate how the effects of

oceanic pH and UV radiation (UVR) will affect microbial detoxification processes in marine

ecosystems. The experimental data gather so far allow us to predict that independent and

interactive effects of UVR and ocean acidification will probably affect microbial community

structure and function. Given the importance of microbial mediated processes, there is a

potential for the disruption of key ecosystem services. At present, there are some major

technical challenges that still need to be met with respect to reliable and replicable integrated

approaches to simulate predicted climate change scenarios and evaluate how they will affect

the toxicity of pollutants and the functioning of microbial communities. This endeavour

demands statistically robust experiments under controlled conditions, where biological and

non-biological markers of environmental function can be accurately identified and quantified.

Microcosm experiments paired with new “omics” technologies, along with field surveys can

provide an excellent framework to ascertain the effect of anthropogenic pollutant toxicity and

microbial function under different climate change scenarios. It is important that we start to

identify interactions resulting from global climate change and anthropogenic pollution in order

to mitigate known and novel environmental threats.
