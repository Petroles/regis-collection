RESUMO 
 
Este estudo apresenta três experimentos na mesma linha de pesquisa. No 

primeiro estudo, foi avaliada a resistência de união através do método push out e 

a dureza Knoop do compósito dental Z250 (3M/ESPE) fotoativado utilizando o 

aparelho de lâmpada halógena XL2500 (3M/ESPE) sob diferentes protocolos de 

fotoativação: modo contínuo (CH) (700 mW/cm2) por 20 segundos; modo contínuo 

de baixa intensidade (CL) (150 mW/cm2) por 20 segundos; e, pulse-delay com 

ativação na intensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) ou 

15 segundos (P15), seguindo-se 1 minuto de espera, e complementado por 700 

mW/cm2 por mais 20 segundos. Para o teste de push out, após a fotoativação, os 

corpos-de-prova foram armazenados a 37ºC ± 1 por 24h ± 1 até serem 

desgastados e polidos, e, os valores de resistência à união foram observados 

numa máquina de ensaio universal (Instron) com célula de carga de 500 N e 

velocidade de 0,5 mm/min. Para o ensaio de dureza, a fotoativação seguiu o 

mesmo protocolo. Após a confecção, as amostras foram embutidas em resina de 

poliestireno e submetidas ao acabamento e polimento com lixas d’água, a fim de 

obter as medidas de dureza, na superfície, a 1mm, 2, 3, 4, e 5 mm de 

profundidade, num durômetro (HMV 2, Shimadzu), utilizando carga de 50g, por 15 

segundos. Os dados foram submetidos à Análise de Variância e as médias ao 

teste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados de resistência à união mostraram que o grupo 

P5,  apresentou valor de resistência de união significantemente maior que os 

demais grupos. O grupo CL apresentou resistência de união menor que o grupo 

anteriormente citado, mas superior aos demais grupos. Não houve diferença 

estatística significativa entre os grupos P2, P3, P10, P15 e CH. A dureza Knoop 

mostrou que os grupos CH e P15 apresentaram as maiores médias de dureza na 

superfície e até 4 mm de profundidade. Os corpos-de-prova do grupo CL 

apresentaram as menores médias de dureza. Na profundidade de 3 mm , a dureza 

Knoop de todos os grupos foi estatisticamente inferior a da superfície. O segundo 

experimento avaliou a resistência de união através do método de push out e a 

dureza Knoop do compósito odontológico Z250 (3M/ESPE), fotoativado com o 

aparelho de lâmpada halógena XL2500 (3M/ESPE), utilizando diferentes 

protocolos de fotoativação: modo contínuo (700 mW/cm2 por 20s) (CO); soft-start

(50 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 

mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 

por 5s, seguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS3); soft-start (200 mW/cm2 por 5s, 

seguido por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS4); soft-start (250 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido 

por 700 mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS5); soft-start (300 mW/cm2 por 5s, seguido por 700 

mW/cm2 por 15s) (SS6). Os testes de push out e de dureza Knoop foram 

realizados como no primeiro experimento. Os dados foram submetidos à Análise 

de Variância e as médias ao teste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados mostraram que o 

grupo SS3, obteve a maior resistência de união quando comparado ao grupo CO. 

Não houve diferença estatística entre os outros modos soft-start em relação aos 

demais grupos. Os outros resultados de dureza, não apresentaram diferença 

estatística entre os grupos na região de superfície e até 4  mm de profundidade. 

Também foi observado que para cada grupo, não houve diferença estatística entre 

a região de superfície até a profundidade de 2 mm. O terceiro experimento avaliou 

a resistência de união através do método de push out do compósito odontológico 

Z250 (3M/ESPE), fotoativado com o aparelho de lâmpada halógena XL2500 

(3M/ESPE), utilizando diferentes protocolos de fotoativação: soft-start (ativação na 

intensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(SS2), 3s(SS3), 5s(SS5), 10s(SS10) ou 15 

segundos (SS15), e complementado por 700 mW/cm2 por mais 15 segundos); 

pulse-delay (ativação na intensidade de 150 mW/cm2 por 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), 

10s(P10) ou 15 segundos (P15), seguindo-se 1 minuto de espera, e 

complementado por 700 mW/cm2 por mais 15 segundos). Os testes de push out 

foram realizados como no primeiro experimento. Os dados foram submetidos à 

Análise de Variância e as médias ao teste de Tukey (5%). Os resultados 

mostraram que não houve diferença estatística entre os  modos soft-start. Para o 

modo pulse-delay, o grupo P5 apresentou resistência de união estatisticamente 

superior aos demais grupos. Os grupos fotoativados pelo modo pulse-delay 

apresentaram resistência de união superior comparados aos grupos fotoativados 

pelo modo soft-start.

ABSTRACT 
 

 This study showed three experiments in the same research line. The first 

study has assessed the bond resistance through the push out method and the 

Knoop hardness of the dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photoactivated with the 

equipment of halogen light XL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of 

photoactivation: the  continuous mode of high intensity (CH) (700mW/cm2) for 20 

seconds; the continuos mode of low intensity (CL) (150mW/cm2) for 20 seconds; 

and the pulse-delay with 150mW/cm2 for 2s(P2), 3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) or 15 

seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by 700mW/cm2 for 20 seconds. For 

the push out test, the test specimens were stored at 370 C  ± 1 for 24h ± 1 until 

they were ground and polished, and, the bond strength values were observed 

through a universal test machine (Instron) with a charge cell of 500N and the 

speed of  0.5 mm/min. For the Knoop hardness, the specimens were made by 

using the same photoactivation protocols. After, the specimens were embedded in 

polyestiren resin and sanded and polished in order to obtain the hardness 

measures on top, 1 mm, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm deep in a hardness measure machine 

(HMV 2, Shimadzu), using a charge of 50g, for 15 seconds. The data were 

submitted to ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5%).  The results of bond strength showed 

that the P5 group presented significantly higher resistance values than the other 

groups.The CL group presented a lower bond resistance than the group previously 

mentioned, though higher than the other groups. There was no statistic difference 

between the groups P2, P3, P10, P15 and CH. The results of Knoop hardness 

showed that the groups CH and P15 presented higher values of Knoop hardness in 

surfaces up to 4 mm deep. The specimens of the CL group presented the lowest 

averages of hardness. At 3 mm deep, the Knoop  hardness of all groups was 

statistically inferior to the surface hardness. The second study evaluated the bond 

strength through the push out method and the Knoop hardness of the dental 

composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photoactivated with halogen lamp unit XL2500 

(3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photoactivation: continuous mode 

(700mW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2

for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) 

(SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); soft-

start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); soft-start (250 

mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start (300 mW/cm2 for 

5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For the push out test and Knoop 

hardness test the specimens were made how the first experiment. The data were 

submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). The results showed that the SS3 group 

obtained the higher bond strength when compared to the CO group. There were no 

differences among the other modes of soft-start in relation to the other groups. The 

other results in hardness, showed no statistic differences among the groups in the 

surface region and up to 4 mm depth. It was also observed that within each group 

there were no statistic differences between the surface region up to the 2 mm 

depth. The third study evaluated the bond strength through the push out method of 

the dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photo activated with halogen lamp unit 

XL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photo activation: soft-start (150 

mW/cm2 for 2s(SS2), 3s(SS3), 5s(SS5), 10s(SS10) or 15 seconds (SS15), 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s(P2), 

3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) or 15 seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by 

700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds). For the push out test the specimens were made how 

the first experiment. The data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (5%). The 

results showed there were no statistic differences among groups photo activated 

using soft-start mode. For pulse delay mode P5 obtained the highest bond 

strength, statistically higher than other groups. The groups photoactivated with 

pulse-delay mode showed bond strength statistically higher than soft-start mode.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 
 

Nos anos 60, as resinas compostas começaram a substituir gradativamente 

materiais restauradores como a resina acrílica e cimento de silicato em 

restaurações de dentes anteriores, porém, com algumas limitações em suas 

aplicações (Ferracane, 1992, Peutzfeldt, 1997) . Um dos principais obstáculos 

encontrados foi a infiltração marginal, causada pela perda do selamento marginal 

devido à contração existente durante o processo de polimerização (Rees &amp;amp; 

Jacobsen, 1989, Uno &amp;amp; Shimokobe, 1994). 

Desde a introdução do sistema de ativação por luz visível para essas 

resinas, surgiram algumas vantagens como tempo de trabalho mais adequado, 

maior resistência à compressão e lisura superficial, entre outras. Porém, 

independente do compósito utilizado, ainda se verificava contração de 

polimerização devido a formação de ligações covalentes entre as moléculas do 

monômero, contraindo a cadeia polimérica (Peutzfeldt, 1997).  

Dentre os fatores que influenciam a contração de polimerização desses 

compósitos  pode-se citar: tamanho das moléculas dos monômeros,  quantidade 

das partículas de carga,  grau de conversão e  natureza do monômero (Walls et 

al., 1988). A contração de polimerização pode formar fendas nas margens das 

restaurações, devido às tensões geradas que rompem a união entre compósito e 

dente, originando com isso infiltrações marginais e, conseqüentemente, irritação 

pulpar, sensibilidade pós–operatória, recidiva de cárie e manchamento marginal 

(Uno &amp;amp; Shimokobe, 1994). 

Dentre as alternativas para se melhorar a integridade marginal das 

restaurações com compósitos são citados: uso de materiais de base como resina 

flow e ionômero de vidro que apresentam menor módulo de elasticidade que o 

compósito para absorver parcialmente as tensões geradas pela contração; 

sistemas adesivos que contemplem efetivamente a união com a estrutura dental; 

uso de técnica incremental e controle do escoamento do compósito durante a 

fotoativação (Asmussen &amp;amp; Peutzfeldt, 2001, Feilzer et al., 1995, Ikemi &amp;amp; Nemoto, 

1994, Lutz et al., 1986, Venhoven et al., 1996, Versluis et al., 1998). 



 6

Em relação ao escoamento durante a fotoativação, várias técnicas têm sido 

propostas com o objetivo de controlar a velocidade durante o processo de 

polimerização (Sakaguchi &amp;amp; Berge, 1998, Uno &amp;amp; Asmussen, 1991). Este controle  

para reduzir a tensão gerada pela contração pode ser conseguido, através de uma 

polimerização inicial com intensidade de luz baixa seguida de polimerização final 

com elevada intensidade, distanciando a ponta do aparelho fotopolimerizador da 

superfície do compósito, ou, usando aparelhos emissores de luz com intensidade 

variável (Feilzer et al., 1995, Koran &amp;amp; Kurschner, 1998, Pires et al., 1993, 

Unterbrink &amp;amp; Muessner, 1995). Assim, a menor taxa de conversão inicial permite o 

escoamento do material, gerando menor tensão interna decorrente da contração e 

posteriormente, a alta intensidade na polimerização promove adequado grau de 

conversão para obtenção de propriedades físicas e mecânicas satisfatórias 

(Davidson et al., 1984, Feilzer et al., 1995, Watts &amp;amp; al Hindi, 1999).  

Como esses fatores parecem contribuir para manutenção da união do 

compósito restaurador ao dente, este estudo propõe avaliar o efeito de se propor 

várias alternativas de se modular a luz emitida pelo aparelho fotoativador durante 

o processo de fotoativação, na resistência de união e também avaliar, de maneira 

indireta, o grau de conversão do compósito através do ensaio de dureza Knoop.

CAPÍTULO 1 
 

Effect of different modes of the light modulation on the bond 
strength and Knoop hardness of dental composite 

(a ser enviado - formatado para o Journal of Dentistry) 
 

Summary 
 

Objective: This study verified the bond strength through the push-out method and 

the Knoop hardness of the composite Z250, photoactivated with the curing unit 

XL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different photoactivation protocols: continuous mode - 

high intensity (CH) (700mW/cm2) for 20 s.; continuos mode - low intensity (CL) 

(150mW/cm2) for 20 s.; and pulse-delay with 150mW/cm2 for 2(P2), 3(P3), 5(P5), 

10(P10) or 15 seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed by 700mW/cm2 for 

20 seconds.  

Methods: For push-out test (n=10), the bond strength values were obtained using a 

universal test machine (Instron) with a cross-head speed of 0.5mm/min. For Knoop 

hardness (n=5), the specimens were made using the same photoactivation 

protocols. After, the hardness measures were made in a hardness machine 

(Shimadzu), using a load of 50g  for 15 s.  

Results: The data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey’s test (alpha=0.05). The 

results of bond strength showed that the P5 group presented significantly higher 

values. The CL group presented a lower value than the CL group, though higher 

than the other groups. There was no difference between the groups P2, P3, P10, 

P15 and CH. The results of Knoop hardness showed that the CH and P15 groups 

presented the highest values in surface up to 4mm deep. The specimens of the CL 

group presented the lowest mean. From 3mm deep, the means of all groups were 

statistically inferior to the surface. 

Conclusion: The initial time exposition for pulse-delay method can influence on the 

bond strength and Knoop hardness of Z250 composite resin.

Introduction 

 

Resin composites are the direct restorative materials more used in dentistry 
1. Current dental composites are expected to have optical and mechanical 

properties comparable to tooth enamel and dentin and provide a service life of 10 

years or more. However, the polymerization shrinkage still remains the primary 

problem of dental composites. Shrinkage is inherent in current commercially 

available system and will persist until non-shrinking or low-shrinkage polymers 2 or 

expanding fillers are available in commercial composites. This creates contraction 

stress and marginal gap, leading to invasion of oral fluids and bacteria 3,4. 

However, several factors limit the performance of this material, especially depth of 

cure and degree of conversion. Light of an appropriate wavelength initiates photo-

polymerization of methacrylate groups producing a highly cross-linked polymer 

matrix. Light from the curing source must be able to adequately polymerize deeper 

composite regions than just the top, irradiated surface. However, as light passes 

through the composite, it is absorbed and scattered, reducing its effectiveness to 

initiate polymerization, and consequently resulting in variation of cure with depth 5. 

Although high light intensity provides higher DC values, it also produces greater 

polymerization shrinkage, which may cause gap formation and further micro-

leakage, compromising the longevity of the restoration 6-8. Another problem is that 

the insufficient polymerization with high residual monomers may be released within 

the first days in oral conditions 9,10. The unreacted monomers result in inferior 

physical properties. Several methods of light modulation are used for the photo-

activation of the composites with the objective of minimizing the stress generated 

by the polymerization shrinkage. These photo-activation methods have been 

suggested to initiate the composite cure reactions, maintaining DC values similar to 

that found using high light intensity, whilst reducing the polymerization shrinkage. 

Soft-start polymerization and pulse-delay polymerization adopt an initially low light 

intensity followed by a final cure with high light intensity. A slower rate of 



 10

conversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases 

contraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation. The complement of 

photo-activation with high irradiance is intended to allow the composite to achieve 

the maximum degree of conversion 7,11,12. Irradiance diminishes as the curing tip is 

moved away from resin composite restorative material 13, and can be used for two-

steps photo-activation methods. Furthermore, the viscoelastic nature of the 

polymerizing composite must also be considered. During polymerization, there is 

an irreversible increase in the elastic modulus of the composite. The moment that 

the loss of the flowing capacity of the material occurs is called gel-point. Prior to 

the gel-point, polymerization contraction will not create stress at the restoration 

margins or within the material, as it is compensated by flow. However, rigid 

contraction after the gel-point has received much attention and has been 

responsible for the induction of stress in the bonding interface 14,15,16 demonstrated 

that the speed of the polymerization reaction has a great effect in the generation of 

stress.  

The testing design for this study was a push-out model. Extrusion testing in 

dentistry was first described in 1970 by Roydhouse 17. He proposed pushing out 

dental material cylinders from tooth discs. Previous studies making use of a conical 

version of the push-out design demonstrating the different bonding properties of 

direct and indirect restorations with highly reproducible measurements 18. Besides 

that, the cavity-like configuration of the bonding area allows the determination of 

both composite bond strength and marginal adaptation on the same sample 18. 

Independently of the photo-activation method applied, the DC must be as 

high as possible, ensuring that the material possesses the best properties. Studies 

in the literature demonstrating a good correlation between DC and hardness of 

composites and, hence, hardness is utilized as an indicator of DC 1,19,20.  

The ideal exposure time with low irradiance in the initial light exposition for 

two-steps polymerization methods is primordial to optimal marginal adaptation and 

mechanical properties of resin composites. The objective of this study was to 

evaluate the influence of initial light exposure time variations using pulse-delay 



 11

photo-activation methods on bond strength (push-out test) and Knoop hardness of 

a resin composite. 

 
Materials and Methods 

 

For this study the composite resin Filtek Z250 (3M/ESPE, St.Paul, MN, 

USA), shade A3, was used. 

 
Push-out test 
 

It was used 70 round metallic matrices with 3mm height containing a 

truncated-cone cavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper 

diameter.  

These matrices were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 µm 

using a micro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the matrices 

were etched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. The 

bonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer, 3M/ESPE) was applied and dried for 5 

seconds. The adhesive system (Adper Single Bond, 3M/ESPE) was applied, air-

dried for 20 seconds and photoactivated for 10 seconds using light-cured with 

halogen lamp XL2500  (3M/ESPE).  

  During the application of resin composite the matrices were set on a Mylar 

strip positioned on a glass slab. The resin composite was bulk inserted and then 

covered with a polyester strip and pressed with a microscope sheet to 

accommodate the material into the matrix and remove composite excesses. 

Composites were light-cured with halogen lamp XL2500 (3M/ESPE). The 

maximum irradiance checked with the radiometer (Demetron Research Corp., 

Danbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. The specimens were photo-activated according 

to the following methods: continuous high irradiance mode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) 

(CH); continuous low irradiance mode (150 mW/cm2 for 20s.) (CL); pulse-delay 

(150 mW/cm2 for 2s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P2); pulse-

delay (150 mW/cm2 for 3s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P3); 



 12

pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) 

(P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 

for 20s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 

mW/cm2 for 20s) (P15). For reduced irradiances, the tip of curing units was moved 

away from composite surface. To standardize the photo-activation distance, 

spacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos Odontológicos Clássico, São Paulo, SP, 

Brazil) were interposed between the surface of the composite and the tip of the 

light curing units. 

After photo-activation, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37ºC ± 1 

for 24h ± 1, in a dark and dry container, before push-out test. The top and bottom 

surfaces of restorations were grounded using 400 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, 

Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, PE, Brazil) on an automated polisher under water 

cooling to remove the composite excess, promoting a correct positioning of 

specimen while testing.  

For push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was 

attached in an universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). An 

sphere-shaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to load 

the composite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The 

push-out bond strength was determined by computing the quotient of maximum 

load (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of truncated cones; mm2). The 

data were submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test at the 5% 

significance level.  

 

 Knoop hardness test 
 

For the Knoop hardness test, one metallic mold (5 mm height X 5 mm 

diameter) were used to obtain 70 specimens. The resin composite was bulk 

inserted. A polyester strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed 

manually to remove composite excesses. Composites were light-cured with 

halogen lamp, according to methods proposed to push-out test: continuous high 

irradiance mode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (CH); continuous low irradiance mode (150 



 13

mW/cm2 for 20s.) (CL); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s, delay of 1 min., followed 

by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P2); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 3s, delay of 1 min., 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P3); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay of 1 

min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, 

delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 

for 15s, delay of 1 min., followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (P15).  

After photo-activation, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37ºC ± 1 

for 24h ± 1, in a dark and dry container. Elapsed 24 hours, the specimens were 

embedded in polyestiren resin for grounding and polishing. After curing of 

polyestiren resin, the specimens were ground and polished using 320, 400, 600 

and 1200 grit sandpapers (Carborundum) on an automated polisher under water-

cooling. The specimens were dried and submitted to Knoop hardness 

measurements in a hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with load of 

50 g for 15 s. For each specimen, five readings were taken and an average was 

calculated. 

The data was submitted to two-way ANOVA (photo-activation mode x 

depth), followed by Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level.  

 
Results 
 
Push-out bond strength 
 

Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond strength 

results. The P5 group revealed significant higher bond strength than other groups. 

Specimens photo-activated using continuous mode with low irradiance (CL) 

presented bond strength statistically lower than group P5, but higher strength than 

other groups. The push-out test did not reveal statistical differences among P2, P3, 

P10, P15 and CH groups.

Knoop hardness test 
 

Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations for Knoop hardness. 

From the top surface up to 4mm depths, groups CH and P15 presented the highest 

Knoop hardness means, which were statistically higher than groups P2 and CL 

(p&lt;0.05). Specimens photo-activated using continuous mode with low irradiance 

(CL) presented the lowest Knoop hardness means (p&lt;0.05). There were no 

statistical differences among groups P3, P5, P10 and CH at any depth. Specimens 

of P2 presented Knoop hardness means statistically lower than group CH at top, 1, 

2, 3, and 4 mm depths. At 5 mm, composites of group CL presented too soft for 

Knoop hardness testing (mean 0.00). There were no statistical differences among 

other groups.  

The comparisons in the row (Table 2) show that at 2 mm depth the Knoop 

hardness of groups P2, P5, P10, and CL, was statistically lower than top surface. 

The Knoop hardness for all groups at 3 mm depth was statistically lower than top 

surface. 

 

Discussion 
 

The composite polymerization is a complex phenomenon that involves 

innumerous factors. The magnitude of stress development depends on the volume 

fraction of fillers, filler geometry, ratio of modulus between polymer and particle, 

adhesion between polymer and particle, inherent shrinkage of the particle, and 

degree of cure of polymer. The shrinkage stress is essential to longevity and 

success composites, and depends on the polymerization rate, composition of 

polymeric matrix, specimen geometry, filler volume fraction, photo-initiators 

concentration, and curing method. The rate of polymerization is influenced by 

photo-initiators concentration, monomer reactivity, molecular weight of monomer, 

leading to different viscosities and mobility 21. Moreover, characteristics related to 

light source, such as energy density and spectral flux, also alter final material 

properties 5,22-26. Energy density is the product of irradiance and the duration of 



 15

light exposure 5,23,24, whilst spectral flux represents the optical power output from 

the light-curing unit, in milliwatts, at each given wavelength 22,25. The DC in a 

photo-activated composite is dependent on the total energy density, at the correct 

wavelength, supplied to the photo-initiator 27. Reduction of this initial speed can be 

obtained through the use of low intensity units that produce few free radicals 28. 

This lower speed gives the composite more time for molecular rearrangement, 

reducing the stress caused by polymerization shrinkage 29. 

 The pulse-delay method described by Kanca (1999) 30, uses the premise 

that a short pulse of light followed by a relaxation period in dark, allows the relief of 

stresses prior to inducing additional stresses during the continuing polymerization 
31. In this work, pulse-delay using 5 seconds of initial exposure time produced bond 

strength statistically higher as compared to other groups. Besides, the presence of 

the highest bond strength means the Knoop hardness was similar to CH groups. In 

those specimens induced less stress at bond interface, however the degree of 

conversion was maintained. According to Sakaguchi et al. 31, the maximum 

contraction force rate occurs within the first 10 s of photo-activation. The 

contraction force can lead to rupture in bond interface, promoting lower bond 

strength. We observed that beyond irradiance, the exposure time has a great 

importance for bond strength when the pulse-delay method was used. When short 

exposure time was used, P2 and P3 groups, showed that the bond strength was 

similar to CH group. Yap et al. 32, use the pulse-delay method in which the initial 

activation was carried out for 3 s at an intensity of 100 mW/cm2, like in this study, 

and did not detect any shrinkage of the composite during photo-activation and the 

waiting period. The authors believe that the energy density of the initial photo-

activation was not enough to effectively initiate a polymerization reaction and all 

the shrinkage the composite underwent, was compensated for by the flow of the 

material. The reaction only became effective when the second high irradiance 

exposure occurred. Thus, the reaction occurred under high intensity with a similar 

reaction speed to that of the CH. However, the Knoop hardness of P2 group was 

affected by short exposure time.  For longer initial exposure times, P10 and P15 

groups, bond strength were similar to CH group. The high energy density during 



 16

the first curing cycle for P10 (15.5 J/cm2) and P15 (16.25 J/cm2) produced high 

conversion of double bonds, leading to high shrinkage polymerization and 

contraction force. This can be seen in the similar Knoop hardness results of P10, 

P15 and CH groups. When specimens were photo-activated using continuous low 

irradiance (CL), bond strength was statistically lower than P5, but higher than other 

groups. The low irradiance during the photo-activation cycle, the polymerization 

reaction occurs slowly, allows the relief of shrinkage stresses, decreasing the 

stress in the bond interface. However, CL group presented the lowest Knoop 

hardness means. Those specimens were photo-activated using the lowest energy 

density (3 J/cm2). Regardless of light modulation method, it has been 

recommended that energy densities similar to those supplied by conventional 

photo-activation (continuous mode) are used. This is recommended because 

previous studies related that the degree of conversion depends on energy density 

that is supplied to the composite than photo-activation method 33,34. Koran and 

Kurschner 12 found that the increase in density led to an increase in the hardness 

values until photo-activation with 17 J/cm2, after which there was no significant 

alteration in hardness values. In this study the maximum energy was given using 

P15 (16.25 J/cm2). Groups that presented the lowest energy density (P2 and CL) 

showed Knoop hardness means statistically lower than CH. The bond strength of 

CL was statistically lower than P5. According to the results of this work, the 

relaxation period in dark is of great importance for stress relief in composite.  

There were great differences between bond strength values. Push-out tests 

enable measurements of bond strength under more cavity-like conditions, 

demonstrating the properties of the restorative system better than in the shear or 

tensile tests. Confined spaces are less favorable from a mechanical perspective as 

a result of a high C-factor 35. Therefore, more stresses occur during polymerization 

that pulls the bonded restoration away from the dentin walls, creating stress at the 

tooth-restorative interface 36. If shrinkage stress overcomes the bond strength, a 

gap may be formed at the tooth-restorative interface. It was observed that 

specimens without gap formation presented high bond strength. However, when 

gap was present, there was a pronounced decrease in the bond strength. The 



 17

gaps are sites of stress concentration. During the push-out test, the stresses are 

focused in these sites, leading to rupture of bond. In those specimens without or 

less gap formation, the stresses are distributed for all bond interface, producing 

high bond strength values.  

 
Conclusion 
 

Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial light 

exposure time variations for pulse-delay photo-activation method influences on 

bond strength and Knoop hardness of the resin composite Z250.

Effect of different initial light intensity by the soft-start photo-
activation technique on the bond strength and Knoop hardness 

of dental composite 
(enviado para o Brazilian Dental Journal) 

 
Abstract 

This study evaluated the bond strength through the push-out method and 

the Knoop hardness of the dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photo activated 

with halogen lamps XL 2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photo 

activation: continuous mode (700mW / cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 

for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed 

by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); soft-start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 

mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); soft-start (250 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 

for 15s) (SS5); soft-start (300 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) 

(SS6). For the push-out test, the specimens were stored at 37°C ± 1 for 24h ± 1 

until they are sanded and polished and the bond strength values were obtained 

through a universal testing machine (INSTRON) with a load cell of 500N and 

the speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data was submitted to the variance analysis 

ANOVA and the average to the Tukey test at a 5% significance level. For the 

Knoop hardness test the specimens were made using the same protocols of 

photo activation. After that, they were embedded in polyestiren resin and 

afterwards sandblasted and polished in order to obtain the hardness 

measurements in hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu), using a 50g load, for 15 

seconds. For each specimen five readings were taken. The averages were 

submitted to the variance analysis and the averages to the Tukey test at a 5% 

significance level. The results of bond resistance showed that the SS3 group 

obtained the higher bond resistance when compared to the CO group. There 

were no difference among the other modes of soft-start in relation to the other 

groups. Regarding the other results in hardness, there have been no statistic 

differences among the groups in the surface region and up to 4 mm depth. It 



 25

was also observed that within each group there were no statistic difference 

between the surface region up to the 2 mm depth. 

 

Key words: dental composite, bond strength, Knoop hardness, soft-start. 

 

Introduction 

 
Resin composites are the direct restorative materials most used in 

dentistry. Current dental composites are expected to have optical and 

mechanical properties comparable to tooth enamel and dentin and provide a 

service life of 10 years or more. However, the polymerization shrinkage still 

remains the primary problem of dental composites. Regardless resin composite 

formulation, contraction polymerization occurs due to covalent bond between 

monomer molecules, leading to polymeric chain shortening (1). Walls et al. (2) 

related that contraction polymerization is influenced by the molecular weight of 

monomer, the filler content, the degree of conversion and the monomer 

formulation.  

This creates contraction stress, leading to marginal gap, invasion of oral 

fluids and bacteria, determining the composite longevity (1). However, several 

factors limit the performance of this material, especially depth of cure and 

degree of conversion (DC). Light of an appropriate wavelength initiates photo-

polymerization of methacrylate groups producing a highly cross-linked polymer 

matrix. Light from the curing source must be able to adequately polymerize 

deeper composite regions than just the top, irradiated surface. However, as light 

passes through the composite, it is absorbed and scattered, reducing its 

effectiveness to initiate polymerization, and consequently resulting in variation 

of the cure with depth (3). Although high irradiance provides higher DC values, 



 26

it also produces greater polymerization shrinkage, which may cause gap 

formation and further micro-leakage, compromising the longevity of the 

restoration. Another problem is that the insufficient polymerization with high 

residual monomers. The amount of residual monomers depends on the light 

source and the photoatctivation method (4). This monomer may be released 

within the first days in oral conditions. The unreacted monomers result in inferior 

physical properties, and can be leached of polymeric matrix (5). Marginal 

integrity can be increased by absorbing stress materials under restorative 

materials; adhesive systems with high bond strength to tooth structure, 

incremental technique filling, and flowing control by light modulation during 

photo-activation (6). 

Several methods of light modulation have been used for the photo-

activation of the composites with the objective of minimizing the stress 

generated by the polymerization shrinkage. These photo-activation methods 

have been suggested to initiate the composite cure reactions, maintaining DC 

values similar to that found using high light intensity, whilst reducing the 

polymerization shrinkage (7). Soft-start polymerization adopts an initially low 

irradiance followed by a final cure with high irradiance. A slower rate of 

conversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases 

contraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation. The complement of 

photo-activation with high irradiance is used in order to make the composite 

achieve the maximum degree of conversion (6). Irradiance diminishes as the 

curing tip is moved away from resin composite restorative material, and can be 

used for two-steps photo-activation methods. Furthermore, the viscoelastic 

nature of the polymerizing composite must also be considered. During 



 27

polymerization there is an irreversible increase in the elastic modulus of the 

composite. The moment when the loss of the flowing capacity of the material 

occurs is called gel-point. Prior to the gel-point, polymerization contraction will 

not create stress at the restoration margins or within the material, as it is 

compensated by flow. However, rigid contraction after the gel-point has 

received much attention and has been responsible for the induction of stress in 

the bonding interface (8). Kinomoto et al. (9) demonstrated that the speed of the 

polymerization reaction has a great effect in the generation of stress. The ideal 

photoactivation method is primordial to optimal marginal adaptation, mechanical 

properties and depth of cure of resin composites (10). By using a lower 

irradiance, free radicals formation will be lower than when a higher irradiance is 

used. A lower free radicals formation means that linear polymerization will 

initially occur to a greater extent, thus the propagating chain comes close to an 

adjacent free radical or initiated chain as cross-linkage can occur. The aim of 

this study was to evaluate the ideal initial irradiance using soft-start photo-

activation methods to produce the highest bond strength (push-out test) and 

Knoop hardness for a resin composite. 

 

Materials and methods 

 

For this study the composite resin Z250, shade A3 was used (3M, St. 

Paul, MN, USA)  

 



 28

Push-out test 

 

Seventy round metallic matrices with 3mm height containing a round 

cavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper diameter were 

used.  

These matrices were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 µm 

using a micro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the matrices 

were etched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. 

The bonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer) was applied and dried for 5 

seconds. The adhesive system (Single Bond, 3M, St.Paul, MN, USA) was 

applied, air-dried for 20 seconds and photo-activated for 10 seconds.  

  During the application of resin composite the matrices were set on a 

Mylar strip positioned on a glass slab. The resin composite Z250 was bulk 

inserted and a Mylar strip was seated on the specimen surface and manually 

pressed using a microscope sheet to remove composite excesses. 

Composites were light-cured with halogen lamp XL2500 (3M/ESPE, St 

Paul, MN, USA). The maximum irradiance checked with the radiometer 

(Demetron Research Corp., Danbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. Composite resin 

were photo-activated according to the following methods: continuous mode (700 

mW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 

for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) 

(SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); 

soft-start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); soft-

start (250 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start 

(300 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For reduced 



 29

irradiances, the tip of curing units was moved away from composite surface. To 

standardize the photo-activation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos 

Odontológicos Clássico, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) were interposed between the 

surface of the composite and the tip of the light curing units. 

After light curing, the specimens were stored in an incubator at 37ºC ± 1 

for 24h ± 1, in a dark and dry container, before the push-out test. The top and 

bottom surfaces of restorations were ground using 400 grit sandpapers 

(Carborundum, Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de Rebouças/Igaraçu, PE, 

Brazil) on an automated polisher under water cooling to remove the composite 

excess, promoting the correct positioning of specimen while testing.  

For push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was 

attached in an universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). A 

sphere-shaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to 

load the composite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 

mm/min. The push-out bond strength was determined by computing the 

quotient of maximum load (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of 

truncated cones; mm2). The data was submitted to one-way ANOVA, followed 

by Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level.  

 

 Knoop hardness test 

 

 For the Knoop hardness test 70 specimens were made with a metallic 

mold (5 mm  height X 5 mm diameter). The resin composite was bulk inserted. 

A polyester strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed manually 

to remove composite excesses. Composites were light-cured with halogen 



 30

lamp, according to the methods suggested for the push-out test: continuous 

mode (700 mW/cm2 for 20s) (CO); soft-start (50 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 

mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS1); soft-start (100 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 

for 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) 

(SS3); soft-start (200 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS4); 

soft-start (250 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-

start (300 mW/cm2 for 5s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS6). For reduced 

irradiances, the tip of curing units was moved away from the composite surface. 

To standardize the photo-activation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, 

Artigos Odontológicos Clássico, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) were interposed 

between the surface of the composite and the tip of the light curing units. 

After light curing, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37ºC ± 1 for 

24h ± 1, in a dark and dry container. Elapsed 24 hours, the specimens were 

embedded in polyestiren resin for grinding and polishing. After curing the 

polyestiren resin, the specimens were ground and polished using 320, 400, 600 

and 1200 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de 

Rebouças/Igaraçu, PE, Brazil) on an automated polisher under water cooling. 

The specimens were dried and submitted to Knoop hardness measurements in 

a hardness tester (HMV 2, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with load of 50 g for 15 s. 

For each specimen, five readings were taken and an average was calculated. 

The data was submitted to two-way ANOVA (photo-activation mode x 

depth), followed by Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level.

Results 

Push-out bond strength 

 

Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond strength 

results. The SS3 group revealed significant higher bond strength than CO 

groups. There were no statistical differences among different soft-start 

methods. There were no statistical differences among groups SS2, SS4, SS5, 

SS6 and CO photo-activation methods.  

 

Knoop hardness test 

 

Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations for Knoop 

hardness. There were no statically differences for Knoop hardness from top up 

to 4mm depth between soft-start method and control group. At 5mm, group 

SS4 presented the highest Knoop hardness means, which were statistically 

higher than groups SS2 and SS3 (p&lt;0.05).  

The comparisons in the row (Table 2) show that at 2 mm depth, the 

Knoop hardness of groups SS1, SS2, SS5, and SS6 was statistically lower than 

top surface. The Knoop hardness for all groups at 3mm depth was statistically 

lower than top surface. 

 

Discussion 

 

 The testing design for this study was a push-out model. Extrusion testing 

in dentistry was first described by Roydhouse in 1970 (11). He proposed 



 32

pushing out dental material cylinders from tooth discs. Previous studies using a 

conical version of the push-out design demonstrated the different bonding 

properties of direct and indirect restorations with highly reproducible 

measurements (12). Besides that, the cavity-like configuration of the bonding 

area allows the determination of both composite bond strength and marginal 

adaptation on the same sample (12). Independently of the photo-activation 

method applied, the DC must be as high as possible, ensuring that the material 

achieves the best properties. Studies in the literature demonstrate a good 

correlation between DC and hardness of composites and, hence, hardness is 

useful as an indicator of DC (5). 

The composite polymerization is a complex phenomenon that involves 

innumerous factors. The magnitude of stress development depends on the 

volume fraction of fillers, filler geometry, ratio of modulus between polymer and 

particle, adhesion between polymer and particle, inherent shrinkage of the 

particle, and degree of polymer cure. The shrinkage stress has great 

importance to longevity and success composites, and depends on the 

polymerization rate, composition of polymeric matrix, specimen geometry, filler 

volume fraction, photo-initiators concentration, and curing method. The rate of 

polymerization is influenced by the photo-initiators concentration, the monomer 

reactivity, the molecular weight of monomer, leading to different viscosities and 

mobility (13). Moreover, characteristics related to light curing unit, such as 

energy density and spectral flux, also alter final material properties (3). Energy 

density is the product of irradiance and the duration of light exposure, whilst 

spectral flux represents the optical power output from the light-curing unit, in 

milliwatts, at each given wavelength (14). The DC in a photo-activated 



 33

composite is dependent on the total energy density, at the correct wavelength, 

supplied to the photo-initiator. Reduction of this initial speed can be obtained 

through the use of low irradiance units that produce few free radicals (15). This 

lower speed gives the composite more time for molecular rearrangement, 

reducing the stress caused by polymerization shrinkage (16). 

 The soft-start method described by Uno and Asmussen (17) uses the 

premise that a short pulse of light allows the relief of stresses prior to inducing 

additional stresses during the continuing polymerization (18). In this work, the 

amount of photons supplied to composite within the same exposure time was 

changed. If the polymerization reaction depends on the generation of free 

radicals, the speed reaction would be changed for different irradiances during 

photo-activation. The results showed the soft-start method using 150 mW/cm2 

initial irradiance (SS3) produced bond strength statistically higher than control 

group (CO). The low irradiance during the photo-activation cycle makes the 

polymerization reaction to proceed slowly, allowing the relief of shrinkage 

stresses and decreasing the stress at tooth-restorative material interface. 

Besides that, SS3 presented Knoop hardness means similar to CO groups 

(p&gt;0.05). That means that, in those specimens, less stress occurred at bond 

interface, whilst the degree of conversion was maintained. According to 

Sakaguchi et al. (18), the maximum contraction force rate occurs within the first 

10 s of photo-activation. The contraction force can lead to rupture in bond 

interface, promoting lower bond strength. The initial irradiance when soft-start 

method is used has a great importance for bond strength. When low irradiance 

was used, SS1 and SS2 groups, bond strength was similar to CO group. We 

expected that by using low irradiance in the photo-activation, the bond strength 



 34

would be increased. However, we believe that in those specimens the energy 

density of the initial photo-activation was not enough to effectively initiate the 

polymerization reaction. The reaction only became effective when the second 

high irradiance exposure occurred. Thus, the reaction occurred under high 

intensity similar to CO, leading to gap formation and lower bond strength (19). 

This may be seen in the Knoop hardness test, in which SS1 and SS2 groups 

presented Knoop hardness means similar to CO.   

There were no statistical differences among SS4, SS5, SS6 and CO for 

bond strength. The speed reaction has been decreased to give the composite 

more time for molecular rearrangement, reducing the stress caused by 

polymerization shrinkage (16). Maybe, the high energy density during the first 

curing cycle for SS4, SS5, and SS6 produced high conversion of double bonds, 

leading to high shrinkage polymerization and contraction force. This can be 

seen in the similar bond strength results to CO. Regardless of the light 

modulation method, it has been recommended that energy densities similar 

those supplied by conventional photo-activation (continuous mode) be used. 

This is recommended because previous studies reported that the degree of 

conversion depends on the energy density that is supplied to the composite and 

the photo-activation method (20). Koran and Kurschner (7) found that the 

increase in energy density led to an increase in the hardness values until photo-

activation with 17 J/cm2, after which there was no significant alteration in 

hardness values. However, the ideal energy density for photo-activation is 

composite dependent. In this study the energy density variations (10.95-14.00 

J/cm2) have no effect on DC, seen on Knoop hardness values.  



 35

Conclusion 

 

Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial 

irradiance variations for the soft-start photo-activation method influences on 

bond strength, but do not have any effects on Knoop hardness values of the 

resin composite Z250. The best alternative for the traditional mode (continuous 

mode) is the soft-start mode with 150mW/cm2 initial pulse.

Effect of different photo-activation techniques on the bond 
strength of dental composite 

 
Abstract 
 

This study evaluated the bond strength through the push out method of the 

dental composite Z250 (3M/ESPE), photo activated with halogen lamp unit 

XL2500 (3M/ESPE), using different protocols of photo activation: soft-start (150 

mW/cm2 for 2s(SS2), 3s(SS3), 5s(SS5), 10s(SS10) or 15 seconds (SS15), 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds; pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s(P2), 

3s(P3), 5s(P5), 10s(P10) or 15 seconds (P15), with a 1-minute delay, followed 

by 700 mW/cm2 for 15 seconds). The test specimens were stored at 370C ± 1 

for 24h ± 1 until they were ground and polished, and, the bond strength values 

were observed through a universal test machine (Instron) with a charge cell of 

500N and the speed of 0.5 mm/min. The data were submitted to ANOVA and 

Tukey test (5%). The results showed there were no statistic differences among 

groups photo activated using soft-start mode. For pulse-delay mode, P5 get the 

highest bond strength, statistically higher than other groups. The groups photo-

activated with pulse-delay mode showed bond strength statistically higher than 

soft-start mode.  

 

Introduction 

 

The resin composites are the direct restorative materials most used in 

dentistry14. This is due to the possibility of bonding to dental structure, through 

adhesive systems, as well as its mechanical properties, that permit this material 

to be used both anterior and posterior restorations, and due to esthetic 

characteristics. However, composites present drawbacks like limited degree of 

conversion, due to the creation of a highly cross-linked network that limits the 

mobility of the reaction system 10. However, the primary problem of dental 

composites is still the polymerization shrinkage.  



 41

The polymerization shrinkage depends on filler content, type of monomer 

used in resin matrix, i.e., monomer with high molecular weight present lower 

contraction than monomer with low molecular weight1. Another alternative is the 

use of non-shrinking or low-shrinkage monomers2. The polymerization 

shrinkage produces stresses. If these stresses are not relief internally, they can 

be concentrated at the bonding interface and produce gap formation3. 

Shrinkage stress at the bonding interface tends to destroy the bond between 

the resin composite and the tooth structure5, 8. 

The magnitude of shrinkage stress is decurrently of polymerization 

reaction speed7. The operator can minimize the shrinkage stress and gap 

formation at interface during photo activation using different photo activation 

methods12 or incremental techniques18. To decrease speedy of polymerization 

reaction, and consequently the shrinkage stress, photo activation techniques 

that suggest low irradiance during the initial period of photo activation were 

proposed7, 20. Soft-start polymerization technique adopts an initially low light 

intensity followed by a final cure with high light intensity. A slower rate of 

conversion allows for better flow of the material, which in turn decreases 

contraction stresses, leading to better marginal adaptation19, 20. The 

complement of photo-activation with high irradiance is to composite achieves 

the maximum degree of conversion5, 7, 20. In the pulse-delay photoactivation 

technique, there is a short time period (about 1-3 minutes) between initial 

exposition and final cure. This procedure can reduce the incidence of 

cavosurface marginal gap and enamel fracture6. Another advantage of this 

photoactivation methods is that the degree of cure is similar to conventional 

method4, 13. 

However there are doubts as the best photo activation method and light 

exposure time to promote adequate bond strength between resin composite 

and dental structure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of 

a resin composite photo activated using soft-start or pulse-delay technique, with 

different initial light exposure time during the first photo activation cycle.

Materials and Methods 
 

It was used 100 round metallic molds with 3mm height containing a 

round cavity with 6mm in the lower diameter and 9mm in the upper diameter 

(Figure 1).  

These molds were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide 40 µm using a 

micro-etcher (Danville Eng. Inc., USA). After sandblasting, the molds were 

etched with phosphoric acid 37% for 15 seconds, water rinsed and dried. The 

bonding agent silane (Ceramic Primer, 3M/Espe, St. Paul, MN, USA) was 

applied and dried for 5 seconds. The adhesive system (Single Bond, 3M/Espe, 

St.Paul, MN, USA) was applied, air-dried for 20 seconds and photo-activated for 

10 seconds.  

  During set, a Mylar strip was positioned on a glass slab. The resin 

composite Z250 (3M/Espe, St.Paul, MN, USA) shade A3, was bulk inserted and 

a Mylar strip was seated on surface of the specimen and pressed manually 

using a microscope sheet to remove composite excesses. 

Composites were light-cured with halogen lamp (XL2500, 3M/ESPE, St 

Paul, MN, USA). The maximum irradiance checked with the radiometer 

(Demetron Research Corp., Danbury, USA), was 700 mW/cm2. Resin 

composites were photo-activated according to follow methods: soft-start (150 

mW/cm2 for 2s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS2); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 

for 3s, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS3); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS5); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS10); soft-start (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (SS15); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 2s, 

delay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P2); pulse-delay (150 

mW/cm2 for 3s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P3); pulse-

delay (150 mW/cm2 for 5s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) 

(P5); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 10s, delay for 1 min, followed by 700 

mW/cm2 for 15s) (P10); pulse-delay (150 mW/cm2 for 15s, delay for 1 min, 

followed by 700 mW/cm2 for 15s) (P15). For reduced irradiances, the tip of 

curing units was moved away from composite surface and to standardize the 

photoactivation distance, spacers of acrylic resin (JET, Artigos Odontológicos 



 43

Clássico, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) interposed between the surface of the 

composite and the tip of the light curing units. 

After light-curing, the specimens were stored in incubator at 37ºC ± 1 for 

24 h ± 1, in a dark and dry container, before push-out test. The top and botom 

surfaces  of restorations were ground using 400 grit sandpapers (Carborundum, 

Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda, Cruz de Rebouças/Igaraçu, PE, Brazil) on an 

automated polisher under water cooling to remove the composite excess, 

promoting a correct positioning of specimen while testing.  

For push-out test an acrylic resin apparatus containing a central hole was 

attached in a universal testing machine (Instron model 4411, England). A sfere-

shaped rod attached to a compression load cell (500N) was used to load the 

composite restorations until failure at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The 

push-out bond strength (PBS) was determined by computing the quotient of 

maximum load (N) and adhesion area (equation for calculation of truncated 

cones; mm2). The data were submitted to two-way ANOVA (photoactivation 

mode x exposure time), followed by Tukey’s test at the 5% significance level.  

 
Results 

 

The Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for bond 

strength results. For pulse-delay photoactivation method group, P5 presented 

mean statistically higher than other groups. Group P2 presented the lowest 

push-out bond strength mean, statistically different of P5 and P10 groups. 

Push-out bond strength test didn´t show statistical differences among groups 

photoactivated using soft-start methods. The comparisons between 

photoactivation methods showed that P3 presented higher bond strength than 

SS3 (p&lt;0.05); P5 presented higher bond strength than SS5 (p&lt;0.05), and P10 

presented higher bond strength than SS10 (p&lt;0.05). There were no statistical 

differences neither specimens of group P2 and SS2, nor specimens of groups 

P15 and SS15 (p&gt;0.05).

Discussion 
 

During photoactivation of the resin composites occur generation of free 

radicals that initiate polymerization reaction. The higher irradiance emitted from 

light source, the higher free radicals generation and faster the speed of 

polymerization reaction10. To decrease speedy of polymerization reaction, and 

consequently the shrinkage stress, photo activation techniques that commend 

low irradiance during the initial period of photo activation were proposed6, 7, 20. In 

this work, soft-start and pulse-delay technique of light modulation were used. 

The results showed that pulse-delay produced higher bond strength than soft-

start, depending on initial light exposure time. Soft-start and pulse-delay 

techniques adopt an initially low light intensity followed by a final cure with high 

irradiance. The difference between soft-start and pulse-delay is that for pulse-

delay, after the first polymerization cycle, there is a period in “dark” (1 minute) 

before the second polymerization cycle. Thus the composite has more time to 

molecular rearrangement and stress relief. In this dark period still occurs 

specimen conversion when samples are exposed to low irradiance. This is due 

to the free radicals that persist in the network after irradiation has ceased. The 

lower initial conversion produces greater mobility and allows more dark-cure 

and stress relief11. For soft-start technique the activation of some free radicals 

during the first photo activation cycle occurs and initiates the polymerization 

reaction. Immediately after the first polymerization cycle the samples are photo 

activated using the maximum irradiance emitted by light source. The high 

irradiance after the first cycle doesn’t allow that the stress be relief internally16. 

Thus the stress produced by fast polymerization reaction by second 

polymerization cycle added to stresses produced in the first cycle were directed 

to bond interface, leading to gap formation and reducing the bond strength as 

compared to pulse-delay technique15.  

When soft-start was used, the initial light exposure time had not influence 

on the bond strength values. However, for pulse-delay technique intermediate 

light exposure time during the first photo activation cycle produced bond 

strength statistically higher than other groups. When the light exposure time is 

reduced, a little amount of free radicals and double bonds conversion are 

produced9. Thus the great amount of reaction occurs in the second 



 45

polymerization cycle, with a fast speed of polymerization. As the polymerization 

in the second cycle occurs at high speed, there is more shrinkage stress, 

leading to lower bond strength values17. 

The groups that used longer initial light exposure times during the first 

photo activation cycle (10 and 15s) also presented bond strength lower than 

intermediate group. When there is a longer light exposure time during the first 

photo activation cycle, a great amount of polymerization reaction occurs. 

Therefore there is no time to stress relief and the shrinkage stress is 

concentrate at bond interface, decrease the bond strength. 

 
Conclusion 

 

Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the initial light 

exposure time variations for pulse-delay photo-activation method influences on 

bond strength of the resin composite Z250. However for soft-start the initial light 

exposure time variations had no influence. Pulse-delay presented bond strength 

statistically higher than soft-start photo activation method.

CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 
 

Apesar da evolução do compósito odontológico, a contração de 

polimerização ainda é o principal obstáculo desse material. Durante a 

contração, tensões provenientes da aproximação das moléculas dos 

monômeros ocorrem e se não forem liberadas internamente, podem se 

concentrar na interface dente-material restaurador, levando à falha quando do 

procedimento restaurador. Para minimizar este problema, surgiram técnicas de 

fotoativação que visam modular a velocidade da reação, possibilitando um 

escoamento do compósito durante os períodos iniciais da polimerização, 

diminuindo a concentração de tensões entre as moléculas de polímero na 

interface. Dentre estas técnicas se destacam os modos soft-start e pulse-delay. 

Entretanto, não existe um protocolo para utilização destas técnicas, pois o 

tempo de exposição e a irradiância ideal para fotoativação ainda não foram 

estabelecidos. Portanto, procurou-se neste estudo verificar a influência do 

tempo de exposição e da irradiância durante o primeiro ciclo de fotoativação 

utilizando os modos soft-start e pulse-delay. Para isto, utilizou-se o compósito 

Z250 submetido aos ensaios mecânicos de resistência de união (push-out) e 

de dureza Knoop.  

O primeiro estudo mostrou que o tempo de exposição inicial para o 

modo pulse-delay teve influência significativa sobre a resistência de união e 

sobre a dureza Knoop do compósito Z250. Durante o primeiro ciclo de foto-

ativação pelo modo pulse-delay, o tempo de exposição de 5s com 150 mW/cm2 

inicial e 700 mW/cm2 de irradiância final apresentou os maiores valores de 

resistência de união, enquanto manteve os valores de dureza Knoop 

semelhante ao grupo controle. Prolongando-se o tempo de exposição à luz, 

mais fótons atingem o compósito, ativando maior quantidade de foto-

iniciadores, ocorrendo desta forma, maior grau de conversão. Durante os 

períodos iniciais de fotoativação é que ocorre a maior geração de tensão de 

contração. A fotoativação com baixa irradiância propicia maior escoamento das 

cadeias monoméricas, diminuindo a geração de tensão na interface, 

produzindo maiores valores de resistência de união. O grupo fotoativado pelo 

modo contínuo com baixa irradiância apresentou resistência de união inferior 



 51

ao grupo foto-ativado pelo modo pulse-delay com tempo de exposição de 5s, 

mas superior aos demais grupos. Entretanto, este grupo apresentou valores de 

dureza Knoop inferiores ao grupo controle. Portanto, os menores valores de 

dureza podem ser devidos ao menor grau de conversão obtido pelo compósito 

quando fotoativado por este modo, inviabilizando sua utilização. Os demais 

grupos não apresentaram valores de resistência diferentes do grupo controle, o 

que mostra que não foram capazes de diminuir a tensão de contração.  

O segundo estudo mostrou que a irradiância durante o primeiro ciclo de 

foto-ativação quando o modo soft-start é utilizado tem influência nos valores de 

resistência de união, mas não na dureza Knoop do compósito Z250 até 4mm 

de profundidade. O grupo fotoativado com irradiância de 150 mW/cm2 

apresentou média de resistência de união superior ao grupo controle (CO), mas 

semelhante aos demais grupos. A irradiância está relacionada com a 

velocidade em que a reação ocorre. Quanto maior for a irradiância, maior será 

a velocidade de reação, levando a maior concentração de tensões na interface. 

Nos grupos fotoativados com baixa irradiância pouca reação deve ter ocorrido 

nos períodos iniciais de fotoativação. Portanto, a maior parte da reação pode 

ter ocorrido durante o segundo ciclo de fotoativação, que é realizado com alta 

irradiância, semelhante ao grupo controle. Já, para os grupos fotoativados com 

irradiância maior que 150 mW/cm2, a maior parte da reação deve ter ocorrido 

durante o primeiro ciclo de fotoativação, numa grande velocidade. Desta forma, 

não foi possível a liberação das tensões internas, proporcionando valores de 

resistência de união semelhante ao grupo controle. Entretanto, os valores de 

dureza Knoop foram semelhantes aos do grupo controle, mostrando que o grau 

de conversão monomérica foi semelhante para todos os grupos. 

O terceiro estudo mostrou que o tempo de exposição para o modo pulse-

delay teve influência significativa sobre a resistência de união do compósito 

Z250, mas não teve influência para o modo soft-start. Além disso, os 

espécimes fotoativados pelo modo pulse-delay mostraram resistência de união 

superior comparados ao modo soft-start. Quando os espécimes são 

fotoativados pelo modo pulse-delay, logo após o primeiro ciclo de fotoativação 

com baixa irradiância, existe um tempo de espera antes do segundo ciclo com 

alta irradiância. Durante este tempo de espera ocorre o relaxamento das 

cadeias poliméricas e a liberação das tensões de contração internamente no 



 52

compósito. Já os espécimes fotoativados pelo modo soft-start, imediatamente 

após o primeiro ciclo de fotoativação os espécimes são fotoativados com alta 

irradiância. Deste modo não há tempo para a “acomodação” das cadeias 

poliméricas, e as tensões são concentradas na interface dente-material 

restaurador, diminuindo os valores de resistência de união. Para o modo soft-

start o tempo de exposição não influenciou nos valores de resistência de união, 

porque não há tempo para a “acomodação” das cadeias poliméricas, 

diferentemente do modo pulse-delay. 

Assim, através dos resultados obtidos neste estudo, pode-se concluir 

que a modulação da luz emitida pelos aparelhos de lâmpada halógena de 

quartzo-tungstênio é um método simples e eficaz para o clínico minimizar a 

formação de tensões durante a fotoativação dos compósitos. A maneira como 

se faz essa modulação pode fornecer resultados superiores ou inferiores ao 

método convencional. 



 53

CONCLUSÃO GERAL 
 

Dentro das limitações deste estudo pode-se concluir que: 

 

1 - A variação no tempo inicial de exposição da luz para o método de 

fotoativação pulse-delay com aparelho de lâmpada halógena influenciou na 

resistência de união e na dureza Knoop do compósito Z250.  

2 – A melhor alternativa de tempo inicial de fotoativação para essa 

técnica foi o de 5 segundos.  

3 - A variação no tempo inicial de exposição da luz para o método de 

fotoativação soft-start com aparelho de lâmpada halógena não influenciou na 

resistência de união do compósito Z250. 

4 – A variação na irradiância inicial para o método de fotoativação soft-

start influenciou na resistência de união, entretanto não afetou os valores de 

dureza Knoop do compósito Z250. 

5 – A melhor irradiância para o modo soft-start foi com pulso inicial de 

150 mW/cm2 e final de 700 mW/cm2. 

6 – O modo pulse-delay mostrou valores de resistência de união 

superiores comparados ao modo soft-start.
