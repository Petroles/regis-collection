RESUMO 

 

 

SILVA, Juscimar, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Junho de 2008. Eficiência e 
estabilidade de nanopartículas de óxidos de alumínio e de ferro para adsorver 
arsênio. Orientador: Jaime Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-orientadores: Walter 
Antônio Pereira Abrahão e Virgínia Sampaio Teixeira Ciminelli. 

 

 

A geoquímica do arsênio e do ferro estão intimamente correlacionadas, de modo 

que os métodos de remoção de As da água são baseados na alta afinidade deste 

metalóide por nanominerias de oxihidróxidos de ferro. No entanto, em ambientes 

anóxicos as bactérias redutoras de ferro desempenham papel crucial na catálise de 

transformações redox que, em última análise, controlam a mobilidade do As em 

ambientes aquáticos. Nanominerias de Al são comuns em solos e sedimentos e também 

apresentam grande afinidade por As. Além disso, sob condições redutoras, o Al é 

estável e sua presença na estrutura dos oxihidróxidos de Fe aumenta a establidade destes 

oxidos, conforme bem documentado na literatura. Desta maneira, a associação da alta 

afinidade dos oxihidróxidos de Fe por As com a estabilidade do Al sob condições 

anóxicas pode ser uma alternativa vantajosa para a remoção de As da água. Neste 

estudo, a espectroscopia Raman foi utilizada para investigar a influência do alumínio 

estrutural nos modos vibracionais de goethitas e das fases formadas entre arsenato e os 

diferentes oxihidróxidos de Al e Fe, bem como o potencial destes nanominerais para 

adsorção de As. A estabilidade do As retido por oxihidróxidos de Al e Fe sob condições 

anóxicas, na presença da bacteria Shevanella putrefaciens e anions competidores, 

fosfato ou carbonato, também foi investigada. Hidróxido de Al de baixa cristalinidade 

[Al(OH)3], gibisita (Gb), ferrihidrita 2 linhas (Fh), hematita (Hm), goethita (Gt) e três 

goethitas com substituição por alumínio (AlGt), contendo 13, 20 e 23 cml mol-1 de Al, 

foram sintetizados e caracterizados química e fisicamente. Estes adsorventes sem e com 



 xiii

arsenato foram caracterizados por difração de raios-X, reflectâcia difusa e 

espectroscopia Raman. A cinética de adsorção em duas diferentes relações 

solido:solução, 2,0 e 5,0 g L-1, e as isotermas de adsorção foram obtidas após equilibrar 

as amostras com soluções de arsenato sob agitação constante. A adsorção máxima de 

As(V) foi medida em diferentes valores de pH, variando de 3 até 9. Os adsorventes 

foram incubados anaerobicamente, sob atmosfera de N2, e os sobrenadantes foram 

periodicamente amostrados para avaliar as concentrações de As solúvel. A presença de 

alumínio estrutural aumentou a área superficial específica e a capacidade de adsorção de 

As da goethita. Os efeitos gerais da presença do Al estrutural foram diminuir a 

cristalinidade e deslocar as linhas espectrais da goethita. Tal desordem estrutural foi 

claramente identificada por espectroscopia Raman e difração de raios-X. As alterações 

nas frequências vibracionais e largura de bandas devido ao Al estrutural resultou em 

perdas e sobreposição de muitas bandas ativas da goethita. Esses efeitos aumentaram 

com o grau de substituição. A técnica Raman também confirmou a ocorrência de 

magnetita na amostra de goethita com menor grau de substituição, conforme 

identificado por difração de raios-X. Bandas vibracionais da ligações As-O foram 

observadas em todos os espectros Raman, exceto para goethita não substituída, 

provavelmente devido ao seu menor carregamento de As. As posições das bandas 

vibracionais As-O sugerem que o As(V) foi fortemente retido na superfície dos minerais 

como complexos de esfera interna. A despeito do rápido equilíbrio, a aumento na 

concentração de sólido, limitou a eficiência e a velocidade da adsorção de As. A 

adsorção máxima de As(V) diminuiu na seguinte ordem: Al(OH)3 &gt; Fh &gt; AlGt13 &gt; 

AlGt20 &gt; AlGt23 &gt; Gb &gt; Hm &gt; Gt. No entanto, calculando as capacidades de adsorção por 

área superficial, Gb, Gt e Hm mostraram valores mais altos. Isto sugere que os sítios 

reativos não foram completamente ocupados por arsenato em goethitas com substituição 

por Al e oxihidróxidos mal cristalisados. Não foi observada relação entre tamanho médio 

das partículas e adsorção máxima. Isto sugere reagregação das partículas durante a análise 

ou imperfeições na superfície das partículas com aumento de sua carga líquida, resultando 

em alta densidade de adsorção. O comportamento de todas as amostram foi fortemente 

depente do pH e a adsorção máxima foi obtida em condições levemente ácidas. De modo 

geral os hidróxidos de Al foram mais eficientes do que os de oxihidróxidos de Fe para 

remover As(V) da água. A presença de alumínio estrutural aumentou consideravelmente a 

eficiência das goehitas, as quais se mostraram promissoras como adsorventes para 

remoção de arsênio de águas contaminadas. Verificou-se que as células de S. putrefaciens 



 xiv

foram capazes de se ligar nas superficies minerais e utilizar os oxihidróxidos de Fe, tanto 

cristalinos quanto mal cristalisados, como aceptores finais de elétrons, mobilizando 

arsenio em solução. Goethitas substituidas por Al apresentaram decrescimo na fração de 

ferro solúvel e As mobilizado com o aumento do Al estrutural. A relação entre área 

surperficial específica e dissolução redutiva de Fe e As também foi afetada pelo aumento 

do Al estrutural, conforme esperado. O fosfato e o carbonato afetaram a cinética de 

redução do Fe devido à precipitação do ferro em solução como fases minerais 

metaestáveis (por exemplo vivianita e siderita). Parece que fases minerais análogas de 

fosfatos serviram como sumidouro para o arsênio, limitando sua mobilização. Fosfato 

competiu fortemente com o arsenato e sua eficiência parece ter sido governada pela 

natureza da ligação entre o As e a surperfície adsorvente. Uma maior fração de As foi 

dessorvido por fosfato na gibbsita, seguida pelas goethitas substituidas por Al. Por outro 

lado, apenas a gibbsita mostrou quantidades significativas de arsenato deslocado por 

carbonato. Não obstante a baixa cristalinidade, o Al(OH)3 foi mais eficiente para reter 

arsenato na sua superfície seguido por ferrihidrita e hematita.

ABSTRACT 

 

 

SILVA, Juscimar, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, June 2008. Effectiveness 
and stability of aluminium and iron oxides nanoparticles for arsenate 
adsorption. Adviser: Jaime Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-advisers: Walter Antônio 
Pereira Abrahão and Virgínia Sampaio Teixeira Ciminelli. 

 

 

The geochemical fates of arsenic and iron are closely correlated that methods of 

arsenic removal from water are based on the high affinity of this metalloid with Fe 

(hydr)oxides nanominerals. Nevertheless, in anoxic environment dissimilatory iron 

reducing bacteria play a fundamental role in catalysing the redox transformations that 

ultimately control the mobility of As in aquatic environment. Aluminium nanominerals 

are ubiquitous and also have great affinity for arsenic. Additionally, under reducing 

conditions, Al is rather stable and its presence in the Fe (hydr)oxides framework 

enhance their stability, as well reported in the literature. Thus, by associating the higher 

binding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the higher stability of Al under 

anoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for removing arsenic from water. 

In this study, we investigated the influence of structural Al in the Raman vibrational 

stretching modes of goethite and arsenate phases formed on its surface and on other Al 

and Fe (hydr)oxides, as well as their potential in adsorbing arsenic. The stability of 

arsenic retained by aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions in the 

presence of S. putrefaciens cells, and phosphate or carbonate competing anions was also 

investigated. Poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], gibbsite (Gb), 2-line 

ferrihydrite (Fh), hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), and three Al-substituted goethites (AlGt) 

containing 13, 20, and 23 cmol mol-1 of Al were synthesised and characterised chemically 

and physically. These adsorbents without and with arsenate were investigated by X-ray 

diffraction, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. Adsorption kinetics at two 



 xvi

different solid:solution ratios, 2.0 and 5.0 g L-1, and adsorption isotherms were obtained 

after equilibrating the samples with arsenate solution under constant shaking. As(V) 

adsorption maxima was measured at different pH ranging from 3 to 9. The adsorbents 

were anaerobically incubated under N2 atmosphere and supernatants were periodically 

sampled to evaluate the contents of soluble As. Presence of structural Al increased the 

specific surface area and the As adsorption capacity of the Gt. The general effects of the 

structural Al were to reduce Gt crystallinity and displace spectral lines. Such structural 

disorder was clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. Changes in 

vibrational frequencies and linewidths due to structural Al resulted in loss and overlap of 

many Gt active bands. These effects increased as the degree of substitution increased. 

Raman technique also confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite in AlGt13 sample, as 

indicated by XRD. As-O vibrational bands were visualised on all Raman spectra, except 

for pure Gt probably due to its lowest content of adsorbed As(V). Positions of As-O 

vibrational band suggested that As(V) was strongly retained on the minerals as inner-

sphere surface complexes. In spite of the fast equilibrium, the increase in solid 

concentration limited the efficiency and velocity of arsenic adsorption. The As(V) 

adsorption maxima decreased in the following order: Al(OH)3 &gt; Fh &gt; AlGt13 &gt; AlGt20 &gt; 

AlGt23 &gt; Gb &gt; Hm &gt; Gt. Nevertheless, by calculating adsorption capacities in terms of 

surface area, Gb, Gt, and Hm showed higher As(V) loading capacity. This suggest that 

available reactive sites were not fully occupied by arsenate on the amorphous and Al-

substituted (hydr)oxides. No relationship was observed between medium particle size and 

maxima adsorption. This suggests re-aggregation of the particles during the particle size 

measurement, or imperfections on the surface of the particles increasing their net charge, 

resulting in high adsorption density. The behaviour of all samples was strongly 

dependent on pH, and the maximum adsorption was achieved in slightly acidic 

conditions. In general, Al hydroxides were more efficient than Fe (hydr)oxides to 

remove As(V) from water. The presence of structural Al enhanced considerably the 

efficiency of the goethites which showed to be promising as adsorbents to remove 

arsenic from contaminated water. We found that S. putrefaciens cells were able to bind 

on mineral surfaces and utilise both noncrystalline and crystalline iron (hydr)oxides as 

electron acceptor releasing arsenic into solution. Al-substituted goethites presented a 

decrease in the fraction of soluble iron and mobilised arsenic as structural Al increased. 

The expected relationship between specific surface area and reductive dissolution of Fe 

and As was also affected by the increment in structural Al. Phosphate and carbonate 



 xvii

affected the kinetics of iron reduction due to precipitation of soluble iron as metastable 

mineral phases (e.g. vivianite and siderite). It seems that analogous mineral phases of 

phosphates served as a sink for As limiting its mobilisation. Phosphate competed 

strongly with arsenate and its efficiency seemed to be governed by the nature of the 

binding mechanism between As and adsorbent surface. Higher fraction of arsenic was 

desorbed by phosphate from gibbsite followed by AlGts. Conversely, only Gb showed 

significant amounts of arsenate displaced by carbonate. In spite of low crystallinity, 

Al(OH)3 was the most efficient in retaining arsenate on its surface followed by Fh and 

Hm.

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

Arsenic is a waterborne contaminant and its occurrence in groundwater is a public 

health concern. The long term exposure to arsenic can lead to critical problems, mainly 

cancers. Following the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) 

many countries worldwide, including Brazil, have adopted the threshold of 10 ?g L-1 of 
As in drinking water, as safer for consumption. 

Among the heavy metalloids and oxianions-forming elements (e.g. As, Se, Sb, 

Mo, V, Cr, U, Re), arsenic is perhaps unique to mobilise at the pH values typically 

found in groundwaters (pH 6.5 – 8.5) and under both oxidising and reducing conditions. 

The geodistribution of As depends on parental rock, and its global average in soil is 

about 5 mg kg-1. Mudstones, shales and slates have the highest concentrations among 

the common rocks, although extremely high concentrations can be found in some coals. 

As the chemistry of arsenic follows closely that of S, the greatest concentration of the 

element tend to occur in sulphide minerals, of which arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is the most 

abundant mineral followed by orpiment (As2S3) and realgar (AsS) (Matschullat, 2000; 

Smedley and Kinniburg, 2002; O’Day, 2006). Then, the natural input of arsenic in the 

environment is closely related to weathering of As-bearing rocks and minerals. 

Anthropogenic source, i.e. mining and smelting activity and pesticides and wood 

preservative uses, has also contributed to such addition.  

In the environment arsenic can be found as inorganic and organic compounds, in 

several valence states, i.e. -3, -1, 0, +3, and +5. In natural water arsenic occurs mainly in 

inorganic forms as trivalent arsenite [As(III)] (as H3AsO3) or pentavalent arsenate 

[As(V)] (as H2AsO4
- and HAsO4

2-). In addition, in marine waters and lakes arsenic can 

undergo microbial methylation and both As(III) and As(V) can coexist with 

monomethilarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethilarsinic acid (DMA). According to 

Matschullat (2000), the methylated species account for up to ?10% of the total As in the 



 xix

euphotic zone of many oceanic regions. Furthermore, redox potential (Eh) and pH 

control the toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability of arsenic as well as the distribution of 

its species. Therefore, arsenite is expected to be the stable aqueous form under 

moderately reducing conditions, roughly from Eh of about +300 mV at pH 4 to -200 

mV at pH 9, whilst arsenate is the dominant species in oxidising aqueous solutions 

(O’Day, 2006). Because of relatively slow transformation on the redox conditions, both 

species, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox environment. 

Nanominerals of aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous and play a 

crucial role on geochemical and biogeochemical reactions and kinetics of arsenic in the 

environment. Sorption reactions on the surface of these nanoparticles have been 

extensively investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms associated with arsenic 

mobility and bioavailability, as an attempt to improve the methods of water treatment 

which are still based on coagulation/precipitation processes. Problems with regard to 

addition of undesirable anions, such as sulphate, nitrate, and chloride into the water are 

the major limitation of this method as well as the safe separation, handling, and disposal 

of the contaminated sludge (Driehaus et al., 1998; Banerjee et al., 2008). Several 

adsorbent materials have been assessed, i.e. aluminium hydroxide (Anderson et al., 

1976; Ladeira et al., 2001), activated alumina (Mortazavi et al., 1999), natural 

(hydr)oxides (Deschamps et al., 2003, 2005; Vithanage et al., 2007), clay minerals 

(Manning and Goldberg, 1996a, 1997; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002), granular ferric 

hydroxides (Driehaus et al., 1998; Wilkie and Hering, 1996), ferrihydrite (Waychunas et 

al., 1993; Jain et al., 1999; Jia and Demopoulos, 2005; Jia et al., 2006), goethite (Grossl 

et al., 1997; Hongshao and Stanford, 2001; Gimenez et al., 2007), and others. 

Even though Al and Fe (hydr)oxides have great affinity for arsenic, attention 

concerning the stability of these nanoparticle should be taken into account. As well 

known, the solubility of aluminium hydroxides are much higher than of ferric ones. For 

instance, stability diagrams developed by Lindsay (1979), show that at the same pH 

activity of Al3+ is roughly 106.12 times higher than the activity of Fe3+, both controlled 

by their poorly crystalline hydroxide phases, under oxidising conditions. Then, soluble 

arsenic in equilibrium with Al nanominerals can be a matter of greater concern. On the 

other hand, changes in redox status affect considerably the stability of the Fe 

(hydr)oxides nanoparticles.  

Dissimilatory iron reduction is an important geomicrobial process in soils, 

sediments, and aquifers, where it depends primarily on Fe(III) (hydr)oxide minerals as 



 xx

terminal electron acceptors (Bonneville et al., 2006). In addition to being an important 

oxidation pathway of organic matter and generating soluble ferrous iron, microbial iron 

reduction can have a major impact on the persistence and mobility of arsenic, toxic 

metals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants under anoxic conditions (Lovley et al., 

1993; Cummings et al., 1999; Zachara et al., 2001; Behrends and Van Cappellen, 2005). 

Many authors have reported arsenic release as a result of dissimilatory reduction of 

Fe(III) to Fe(II) (Cummings et al., 1999; Zobrist et al., 2000; Islam et al., 2004; Burnol 

et al., 2007). Microbially mediated reduction of assemblages comprising arsenic sorbed 

to ferric (hydr)oxides is gaining consensus as the dominant mechanism for the 

mobilization of arsenic into the West Bengal and Bangladesh aquifers (Smedley and 

Kinniburg 2002; Islam et al., 2004; O’Day 2006).  

Several of the iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles have isostructural equivalents in 

which cations other than Fe occupy the interstices of the oxygen framework. Therefore, 

the existence of these isostructural compounds suggests that solid solutions could be 

formed between end members via isomorphous substitution for Fe(III) by other cations 

(Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). Al is 17% smaller than iron, and, even though it is 

separated from Fe by forming Al-silicates (clay minerals), a significant proportion is 

always also incorporated into Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Goethite is one of the 

thermodynamically most stable iron oxides (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003) in soil 

and sediments and the full range of substitution in natural sample of up to 33 cmol mol-1 

is found.  

Aluminium is stable under anoxic conditions, since it does not participates of the 

electron transferring reactions. For this reason, the presence of structural Al enhance the 

stability of the iron (hydr)oxides, as already reported. Slower rate of reductive 

dissolution (chemical or microbiological) in the presence of Al substituting Fe in the 

iron (hydr)oxides structure was reported by Schwertmann (1984), Jeanroy et al. (1991), 

and reference therein. Torrent et al. (1987) observed that Al substitution depressed the 

reductive dissolution of synthetic goethite and hematite by dithionite/citrate/bicarbonate 

solution. Bousserrhine et al. (1999) also demonstrated that biological reduction of Al, 

Cr, Mn, and Co-substituted goethites was decreased as substitution increased. Al-

goethite was more resistant to reductive dissolution than other substituted goethites. 

Thus, by associating the higher binding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the 

higher stability of Al under anoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for 

removing arsenic from water.  



 xxi

Natural attenuation of arsenic by adsorption on (hydr)oxides nanominerals may be 

also limited due to competing oxyanions, in which one anion will normally be 

competing for the sorption sites (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001; Sahai et al., 2007; 

Zang et al.; 2008). Due to similar acid dissociation constants phosphate (pKa1 = 2.1, 

pKa2 = 7.2, 
 pKa3 = 12.3) behaves much like arsenate (pKa1 = 2.2, pKa2 = 6.9, 

 pKa3 = 

11.4). Therefore, they should have similar effects on the surface of the (hydr)oxides 

nanoparticles. Hongshao and Stanforth (2001) found that under acidic conditions the 

quantity of arsenate that is replaced with phosphate from goethite increases with contact 

time before phosphate is added, but the amount of arsenate that can not be replaced with 

phosphate is independent of contact time at an initial molar ratio of phosphate to 

arsenate of 1, and vice versa. Zang et al. (2008) verified that the density of irreplaceable 

phosphate or arsenic on goethite decreases to a limit with an increase in the initial 

concentration of the other anion. Liu et al. (2001) reported that more arsenate is 

replaced by phosphate from goethite as the initial molar ratio of phosphate to arsenate 

increases. Manning and Goldberg (1996) suggested that there were sites on the surface 

that were specific for each ion as well as some nonspecific sites on which both ions 

could adsorb.  

In addition to phosphate, carbonate may also, to a lesser extent, limit the arsenate 

sorption reactions. The displacement of adsorbed As with dissolved carbonate was 

recently examined theoretically by Appelo et al. (2002), and this mechanism was 

proposed to be potentially one of the major reasons for high As concentrations in 

groundwater. In Bangladesh, the mobilization of As by carbonate has been used to 

explain the occurrence of high levels of As in groundwaters (Anawar et al., 2003).  

Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the adsorption and replacement of one anion 

from mineral nanoparticles by another. In addition, investigations of the competition 

between the anions can provide insight into the reactions occurring on the surface. 

Spectroscopy investigations show that arsenic is strongly bonded on the surface of 

the Al and Fe (hydr)oxide nanoparticles due to ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups 

(OH or OH2), and the formation of inner-sphere binuclear monodentate-bidentate 

surface complexes is the principal binding mechanism (Waychunas et al., 1993; Sun and 

Donner, 1996 and 1998; Manning et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 2001; Ladeira et al., 

2001; Ona-Nguema et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007). Nevertheless, Catalano et al. 

(2008) reported outer- and inner-sphere arsenate complexation on the surface of 

corundum and hematite. In the past few years, Raman spectroscopy has also been 



 xxii

applied to assess arsenic coordination in a variety of geologic and synthetic material 

with environmental remediation purpose (Myneni et al., 1998; Frost and Kloprogge, 

2003; Frost et al., 2003; Frost et al., 2006). Raman spectroscopy is a scattering 

technique that provides information on vibrational modes of molecules. When photons 

of visible light are scattered with the emission or absorption of phonons, the energy (or 

frequency) shifts are very small, but they can be measured. The process is referred to as 

Raman Scattering when the phonon emitted or absorbed is optical. Otherwise, they are 

acoustical and the process is referred to a Brilhonin scattering. The resulting differences 

between scattered and incident energy correspond to specific energy-level differences 

for the substance under study and such yield insights into its molecular structure. It can 

distinguish, unambiguously, between minerals with the same stoichiometry but different 

crystal structure. Unlike FTIR, the Raman spectroscopy in aqueous system is 

straightforward because water is a weak Raman scatter. In addition, this technique is 

non-destructive, requires minimal sample preparation, and can be used on massive 

specimens from lump or to fine powder and liquid (Hope et al., 2001). 

Vibrational spectroscopy studies have shown that the symmetry of the AsO4
3- 

tetrahedron is strongly distorted by the protonation, cation presence, and water 

coordination (Myneni et al., 1998a and 1998b). The vibrational spectra of Ca, Mn, Fe, 

Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn AsO4
3- complexes in crystalline hydrated solids indicate that the As-

OMetal symmetric stretching vibrations shifted to different energies when compared to 

the aqueous AsO4
3-. For example, the transition metal arsenates, such as those of Mn, 

Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn exhibit a red shift for symmetric stretching vibrations, whilst the 

vibrational Al-arsenate spectra shifted to a lower wavenumber, as predicted by 

theoretical studies (Myneni et al. 1998). Among all tetrahedral oxyanions, the position 

of the arsenate vibrations occurs at lower wavenumbers than the other naturally 

occurring mineral oxyanions (Frost et al., 2006). 

Accordingly, this work aimed to investigate experimentally the effectiveness of 

synthetic poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide, gibbsite, ferrihydrite, hematite, 

goethite, and Al-substituted goethites for adsorbing arsenic from contaminated water 

and evaluate the stability of the sorption products face to dissimilatory iron reduction 

and competing anions. The results presented herein are divided in three chapters: in the 

chapter 1, we investigated the Raman stretching spectra of these synthetic nanominerals 

without and with loaded As(V) and identified the arsenate phases associated with by 

adsorption process; the chapter 2 presents the results of arsenate adsorption process onto 



 xxiii

the surface of the samples assessed by kinetics, isotherm and envelope of adsorption. 

Finally, in the chapter 3, we report the effect of bacterial iron reduction and competing 

anion, phosphate and carbonate, on arsenic mobilisation.

RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY OF As(V) LOADED Al AND Fe (HYDR)OXIDES 

 
 

ABSTRACT 

Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to characterise Al and Fe (hydr)oxides 
features. Nowadays, that technique has also been applied to the study of contaminants in 
soils, sediments, and waters. Most of investigations involve identification of arsenate 
phase in connection with Al and Fe (hydr)oxides since they are ubiquitous and play a 
key role in controlling As mobility and bioavailability. However, these investigations 
have been carried out on pure minerals, and little is known about the vibrational 
stretching modes of the Fe (hydr)oxides containing structural Al. Thus, the objective of 
this work was to investigate the influence of structural Al in the vibrational stretching 
modes of goethite as well as identify the arsenate phase formed on its surface and on 
other Al and Fe (hydr)oxides. Hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), 
gibbsite (Gb), poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and Al-substituted 
goethites (AlGts) were synthesised, and characterised chemically and physically. These 
adsorbents without and with adsorbed arsenate were investigated by means of X-Ray 
diffraction, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. Presence of structural Al 
increased the specific surface area of the Gt, and its As adsorption capacity. The general 
effects of the structural Al were to reduce Gt crystallinity and displace spectral lines. Such 
structural disorder was clearly identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. 
Changes in vibrational frequencies and linewidths due to structural Al resulted in loss and 
overlap of many Gt active bands. These effects increased as the degree of substitution 
increased. Raman technique also confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite in AlGt13 
sample, as indicated by XRD. As(V) loading adsorbents caused changes or no additional 
phases in the XRD and diffuse reflectance patterns. On the other hand, As-O vibrational 
bands were visualised on all Raman spectra, except for pure Gt probably due to its lowest 
content of adsorbed As(V). Positions of As-O vibrational band suggested that As(V) was 
strongly retained on the minerals as inner-sphere surface complexes, except for Gb and 
Hm where a lesser stable complex seems to predominate due to evidence of surface 
precipitation. After thermal treatment, magnetite transformed completely into Hm which 
presented a red shift on the spectral line evidencing the presence of Al in the magnetite 
lattice. 

 
Keywords: Raman spectroscopy, arsenic, Al-substituted goethite, iron and

1. INTRODUCTION 

The groundwater and surface water contamination by arsenic around the world is 

a very sensitive issue which has concerned the scientific community. The most serious 

problems related to arsenic contamination have been reported in Bengal Basin (West 

Bengal and Bangladesh, mainly) where more than 40 million people have been drinking 

water with excessive arsenic (Smedley and Kinniburg, 2002). In Brazil, some areas of 

the Iron Quadrangle mineral province in Minas Gerais State revealed a naturally high 

As background due to arsenopyrite mineralization in either disseminated veins or 

fractures, with average As concentrations above 100 mg kg-1 in soils and 100 µg L-1 in 

local water (Mello et al., 2006; Deschamps et al., 2005; Matschullat et al., 2000). On the 

basis of chronic toxicological effect of As, currently WHO recommends the threshold of 

10 ?g L-1 in drinking water.  
Arsenic in the environment can exist either as organic or as inorganic forms, and 

its toxicity depends primarily on its valence states (-3, 0, -1, +3, or +5). Redox potential 

(Eh) and pH control As speciation, and then its toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability in 

terrestrial environment. In addition, arsenic can be methylated and both As(III) and 

As(V) can coexist with monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid 

(DMA). Because of relatively slow transformation on the environmental redox 

conditions, both species, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox 

environment. 

The most common technique for removing arsenic from water is coagulation with 

ferric salts, followed by filtration (Driehaus et al., 1998). However, due to the 

difficulties to handle the waste generated by coagulation technique, the attempt to seek 

for more efficient methods have propelled the investigation of different adsorptive 

materials. Adsorptive process have been assessed and materials such as activated 

alumina, poorly crystalline ferric hydroxides and granular ferric hydroxides, have been 

shown to be more promising due to their high affinity for arsenate (USEPA 2000, and 

references therein). 

The main surface complexes formed between arsenic and Al and Fe (hydr)oxides 

are inner-sphere mono and, or, binuclear, involving ligand exchanges with surface OH 

and OH2 groups. These linking mechanisms have been confirmed by different 

techniques, i.e. EXAFS (Waychunas et al., 1993; Manning et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., 

2001; Ona-Nguema et al., 2005; Makris et al., 2007), ATR-FTIR (Sun and Donner, 

1996 and 1998), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Goldberg et al., 2001).  



 3

Raman spectroscopy has also been a useful tool to identify arsenic compounds 

with environmental remediation purpose (Frost and Kloprogge, 2003; Frost et al., 2003; 

Frost et al., 2006), since its mobility and availability is mostly controlled by Al and Fe 

(hydr)oxides. Raman spectroscopy is a scattering technique that provides information 

on vibrational modes of molecules. When photons of visible light are scattered with the 

emission or absorption of phonons, the energy (or frequency) shifts are very small, but 

they can be measured. The process is referred to as Raman Scattering when the phonon 

emitted or absorbed is optical. Otherwise, they are acoustical and the process is referred 

to a Brilhouin scattering. The resulting differences between scattered and incident 

energy correspond to specific energy-level differences for the substance under study and 

such yield insights into its molecular structure. It can distinguish, unambiguously, 

between minerals with the same stoichiometry but different crystal structure. Unlike 

FTIR, the Raman spectroscopy in aqueous system is straightforward because water is a 

weak Raman scatter. In addition, this technique is non-destructive, requires minimal 

sample preparation, and can be used on massive specimens from lump or to fine powder 

and liquid (Hope et al., 2001). 

Vibrational spectroscopy studies have shown that the symmetry of the AsO4
3- 

tetrahedron is strongly distorted by the protonation, cation presence, and water 

coordination (Myneni et al., 1998a and 1998b). The vibrational spectra of Ca, Mn, Fe, 

Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn AsO4
3- complexes in crystalline hydrated solids indicate that the As-

OMetal symmetric stretching vibrations shifted to different energies when compared to 

the aqueous AsO4
3-. For example, the transition metal arsenates, such as those of Mn, 

Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn exhibit a red shift for symmetric stretching vibrations, whilst the 

vibrational Al-arsenate spectra shifted to a lower wavenumber, as predicted by 

theoretical studies (Myneni et al. 1998b). Among all tetrahedral oxyanions, the position 

of the arsenate vibrations occurs at lower wavenumbers than the other naturally 

occurring mineral oxyanions (Frost et al., 2006). 

Although several spectroscopy investigations have confirmed the strong 

attachment of arsenic onto Al or Fe (hydr)oxide surfaces, no spectroscopic studies have 

been related to As adsorbed onto Al-substituted goethites. Therefore, this work aimed to 

investigate the Raman stretching spectra of Al-substituted goethites, hematite, goethite, 

gibbsite, poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide, 2-line ferrihydrite pure, and loaded 

with As(V) and identify the arsenate phases associated with by adsorption process.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Synthesis of Al and Fe (Hydr)oxides 

2.1.1. Iron (Hydr)oxides Synthesis. Hematite (Hm), Goethite (Gt), and 2-line 

Ferrihydrite (Fh) were synthesised by neutralizing Fe(NO3)3 solution with KOH 

following the procedure described in Schwertmann and Cornell (2000). A series of 

Aluminium substituted goethite was also synthesised following the methods therein. 

Three Al-substituted goethites with different Al:Fe ratio (15:50, 25:50, and 35:50) were 

prepared from a ferrous solution and aluminium chloride by precipitation with 

potassium hydroxides and aged in a plastic bottle during 90 days. Slow oxidation of 

Fe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al3+ in the goethite structure were achieved by 

opening the bottle daily and vigorously stirring the suspensions during 5 minutes. 

In order to remove the excess of Al3+, the precipitates were washed twice with 0.01 

mol L-1 KOH solution. All (hydr)oxides were washed with Milli-Q water, 

centrifuged, and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air circulation, except for Ferrihydrite 

which was freeze-dried. 

 

2.1.2. Aluminium Hydroxides Synthesis. Gibbsite was prepared following 

procedures outlined in Kyle et al. (1975). An Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with 

4 mol L-1 NaOH solution to a pH of 4.6 ± 0.2. The gelatinous precipitate was heated for 

two hours at 40 oC, then washed twice, dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 36 days, and 

dried at 50 oC. Poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide was prepared from an 

aluminium nitrate solution by precipitation with 4 mol L-1 NaOH solution. The 

procedure was similar to that followed for the synthesis of gibbsite, but the heating was 

suppressed step to preserve a low crystallinity. Similarly to ferrihydrite, poorly 

crystalline aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in order to prevent further 

crystallization. 

 

2.2. Characterisation Analyses. Particle size distribution was obtained by laser 

particle size analyser (Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200). Prior to particle 

measurement, samples were externally dispersed in a sodium metaphosphate medium 

for 1 h. The content of Al and Fe were determined by wet chemistry methods. Thus, 

0.1000 g of dried sample was mixed with 3 mL of HCl and 1 mL of HNO3 (both 

double-distilled) into a conical Teflon digestion vessels (10 mL) with screw caps. After 

10 min the vessels were closed and placed on a hot-plate. The digestion was carried out 



 5

at 120 oC for about 4h, and after that, the samples were left digesting overnight at 70 oC 

constant temperature. After cooling to room temperature, the digested samples were 

transferred to 25 mL volumetric flask, filled with Milli-Q water. Aliquots were 

transferred to 10 ml plastic bottles and stored until measurements. Total Al and Fe were 

determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), 

using a perking Elmer Optima 3300 DV. The degree of Al3+ substitution in the Gt was 

determined by the Al:Fe molar ratio, i.e. cmol mol-1 = Al3+/(Al3++Fe3+)*100. 

The specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption (BET method) using 

multiple point technique (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000). The sample was 

previously degassed at 110 oC for 2 h with vacuum a continual stream of N2 prior to the 

surface area determination. 

 

2.3. As(V) Loaded (Hydr)oxides. Al and Fe (hydr)oxides were loaded with 

arsenate by supplying As(V) to one gram of each sample in 10 mmol L-1 CaCl2 

solutions at pH 5.0 ±0.2. Suspensions were left reacting in a horizontal shaker for one 

week, and after that, the tubes were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 30 min.), the supernatants 

were filtered through 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA) and stored 
for further As analyses. The As-rich (hydr)oxides were freeze-dried and stored for 

further spectroscopic studies. Amounts of adsorbed As(V) were calculated by the 

difference between the initial and final As concentration in solution. Arsenic adsorbed 

by the reaction vessels were measured in blanks containing arsenic solution but no 

adsorbent materials. Contents of As in solution were measured by inductively coupled 

plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3300 

DV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for instrumental instabilities and 

matrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the solution to reach a final 

concentration of 44.5 µmol L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.42 µmol L-1 of As 
were obtained. All assays were carried out in triplicates. 

 

2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance (DR). These techniques 

were used to characterise the synthesised adsorbents and to investigate the influence of 

structural Al in the Gt properties. Self-supporting mounts were prepared by adding 

powdered samples (&lt;53 ?m) into rectangular holes of glass slides and Al sample 
holders for further analyses on XRD diffractometer and diffuse reflectance 



 6

spectrometer, respectively. XRD was performed using a cobalt K? radiation at 40 kV 
and 30 mA in a Rigaku diffractometer with graphite monochromator. Acquisition time 

for the XRD patterns in the 4-80o 2? interval was set at 10 sec per 0.05o 2? step. For 
DR, samples were gently pressed against aluminium paper to minimise preferred 

orientation. Holders were placed into the sphere, and the spectra were recorded from 

300 to 900 nm in 0.5 nm steps at 52 nm min-1 using a double cluster GBC, model 

CINTRA 20, equipped with an MgSO4-coated integrating sphere 10 cm in diameter. 

The diffuse reflectance spectra of each adsorbent were treated mathematically in order 

to eliminate imperfections and noises. From this process, the data were smoothed 

following the method stated by Barrón et al. (2000). The graphics of the second 

derivative of the Kubelka-Munk function [f(KM) = (1 – R)2/2R, where R is the 

reflectance in percentage] were obtained from the percentage of the spectra of the 

smoothed reflectance. 

 

2.5. Raman Spectroscopy. Analyses were performed on dried samples in a Jobin 

Yvon/Horiba model LabRam HR 800. The detector was 1024 x 256 pixel liquid 

nitrogen cooler charge coupled device (CCD). A He-Ne laser 632.8 nm wavelength and 

power output of 20 mW measured at the laser head was used as the excitation force. In 

order to avoid sample degradation, the laser power was always kept below 0.08 mW on 

the sample, except for Gb and Al(OH)3. Samples were targeted by the laser beam 

through microscope objective (Olympus 100X, 0.9 NA), and the scattered light was 

collected through the same objective in a back scattering configuration. The entrance 

slits to the spectrograph were 100 micrometers with a correspondent resolution of 2.0 

cm-1. Holographic grating was of 600 g mm-1. Frequency calibration was achieved using 

the 520 cm-1 line silicon. The sample was pressed on a glass slide on the microscope 

stage. Acquisition time was at 30 s per scan (? 10). Collected Raman spectra were 
analysed and optimised with Origin 7.0 software, and the collected spectra were 

normalised and background corrected. 

As magnetite was shown to co-precipitate with the smallest degree of Al 

substitution, laser-induced thermal effect was also investigated in order to observe the 

crystal stability and feasible phase transformation. Firstly, a darker crystal (magnetite) 

was selected, and a spectrum was obtained at 0.08 mW. Secondly, the filter was 

removed and so the crystal was directly irradiated by the laser beam at 8 mW per three 



 7

seconds. After that, the power of the laser beam was decreased to the initial value (0.08 

mW), and a second run was carried out upon the modified sample. 

 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Characterisation Analyses. Assuming the theoretical formula for each 

mineral, the recovering percentage by wet digestion was higher than 90%. Trace 

amounts of Al in Hm, Gt, and Fh, as well as Fe in Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 

were, in general, lower than standard error of the mean, and so attributed to analytical 

error. The Al-goethites end products presented 0.13, 0.20, and 0.23 cmol mol-1 of Al 

(Table 1). According to these substitution degrees in the Al-goethite structures, they will 

be henceforth referred to as AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23. 

Ferrihydrite exhibited the highest surface area followed by AlGts. Specific surface 

area of the Al-substituted goethites slightly increased as the aluminium incorporation 

increased from 13 to 20 cmol mol-1, but decreased with further increase of Al content. 

No trend between Al content and surface area was observed, as also previously reported 

by Schulze and Schwertmann (1987), Strauss et al. (1997), and Gonzales et al. (2002). 

According to Gonzales et al. (2002) the crystal size of goethite became smaller as Al 

substitution increased, but no clear trend between Al content and surface area was 

observed.  

Particle size distribution obtained for samples passed through &amp;lt;53 µm sieve 

decreased in the following order: Fh &gt; Gb &gt; Al(OH)3 &gt; AlGt13 &gt; AlGt20 &gt; AlGt23 &gt; Gt &gt; 

Hm. Since specific surface area is related to the particle size, the negative correlation 

between these characteristics was expected. However, no trend was observed between 

this variable and specific surface area (Table 1). An explanation is occurrence of 

aggregation processes, affecting the particle size measurement, in spite of ultrasonic 

dispersion before and during analysis, mainly for ferrihydrite. According to Cornell and 

Schwertmann (2003) the small and spherical particles of ferrihydrite often pack together 

to form aggregates. Analytical limitation of the laser particle size analysis could be also 

argued to explain the lack of correlation. Transformation of diffraction patterns to grain size 

is based on matrixes, which are calculated for spheres (Konert and Vandenberghe, 1997). In 

that case, the volume of platy particles (e.g. gibbsite) may be overestimated because such 

particles are larger than their equivalent spherical diameter (Pye and Blott, 2004). 

Conversely, the volume of elongated  or  very  angular  particles  might  be  underestimated.

In addition, the technique does not take into account imperfections on the mineral 

structure which can significantly contribute to increase the reactive adsorption sites. For 

instance, ionic substitution of Al for Fe in the goethite lattice has a marked effect on 

goethite properties, such as variations in crystal size, shape and surface area, and 

structural OH content (Murad and Schwertmann, 1983; Schwertmann, 1984; Schulze 

and Schwertmann, 1987; Torrent et al., 1987; Jeanroy et al., 1991) which account for 

great structural disorder. The amount of adsorbed arsenate calculated herein indicates 

that all adsorbents were fully loaded, as indicated by maximum capacities 

measurements (Silva et al., 2008). 

 

3.2. XRD spectra. In general, the XRD patterns revealed well defined sharp 

peaks, characteristics of well crystallised minerals for Hm, Gt, and Gb (Figure 1). The 

main peaks corresponds to d(104), d(110), and d(002), as previously reported by Dixon 

and Weed (1989) and Cornell and Schwertmann (2003). Ferrihydrite spectrum exhibited 

high degree of structural disorder with two broad peaks at ~38 and ~74 2? 
corresponding to d(110) and d(300), typical of 2-line ferrihydrite. Aluminium hydroxide 

[Al(OH)3] also showed typical spectrum with no diffraction pattern confirming its poor 

crystallinity. XRD peaks for Al-substituted goethites fairly agree with the pure goethite, 

but with shifts on the diffraction lines towards higher angles due to the presence of 

structural aluminium. It is well known that the size at the unit cell decreases when Al 

replaces Fe in the goethite structure, because the Al3+ ion is slightly smaller than the 

Fe+3 ion, i.e. 0.053 vs 0.065 nm respectively (Schulze and Schertmann, 1984). The 

higher is the degree of Al substitution the greater are the shifts, as observed herein. In 

addition, a narrow peak at ~42o 2? (d = 0.2532 nm) was detected on the AlGt13 XRD 
spectrum, which can be ascribed to magnetite. The presence of magnetite as 

coprecipitated with AlGt13 was confirmed by attraction to a magnet. Magnetite 

formation is feasible at low Al/(Al + Fe) ratio due to the slow oxidation of ferrous ions. 

As the aluminium concentration is low, the excess of Fe3+ can encapsulate part of the 

soluble Fe2+ ions, leading to formation of magnetite rather than goethite. At an Al/O4 

molar ratio close to 0.4, substitution of aluminium for iron tetrahedrically coordinated in 

the magnetite structure is expected (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). 

 

3.3. DR spectra. The second derivative of the Kubleka-Munk function [f(KM)] 

from the fitted diffusion reflectance spectra showed typical observation bands  for  hematite,

ferrihydrite, and goethite (Figure 2), as reported in the literature (Sherman and Waite, 

1985; Scheinost et al., 1999; Torrent and Barrón, 2003). Al-substituted goethites 

showed reflectance pattern similar to pure goethite, but with slight shifts of the ?430 nm 
band to shorter wavelengths (blue shift), as Al-substitution increased. In addition, 

absorption bands close to 360-380 nm were pronounced for Al-goethites, which this band 

is ascribed to the 6A1       
4E(4D) ligand field transition of Fe3+ (Sherman and Waite, 

1985). Therefore, it can be surmised that this behaviour is due to structural disorder in 

the Gt framework caused by the presence of Al. The effects of Al substitution in goethite

can be also seen in the logarithmic function of the diffuse reflectance spectra against 

wavelength (Figure 3). The blue shift of the main absorption edge (towards higher 

energy), represented by the electron pair transition (EPT1 and EPT2), is in line with 

Kosmas et al. (1986) and Scheinost et al. (1999). Malengreau et al. (1996) also observed 

such blue shift, but they were not able to establish a quantitative relationship between 

band shift and Al substitution. We also failed to evidence that relation because the 

AlGt13 reflectance spectrum is quite different from the other goethites. It exhibited a 

higher light absorption capacity due to its darker colour as a resulted of the co-

occurrence of the magnetite.  

The reflectance spectra of the sample loaded with arsenate exhibited no difference in 

relation to the samples without arsenic. Then, it can be assumed that the surface complexes 

formed between arsenate and iron (hydr)oxides surface groups do not substantially affected 

the ligand field transition property of the ferric minerals.

3.4. Raman spectroscopy. The As-O stretching vibration is very sensitive to its 

environment and it has been used to identify different arsenate phases (Goldberg and 

Johnston, 2001; Frost et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2006). It can be observed that the Raman 

spectra of crystalline (hydr)oxides showed sharp peaks whilst the poorly crystalline 

minerals exhibited a noise broad peaks due to high degree of structural distortion.  

 

3.4.1. Raman spectra for Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3. Hydroxyl stretching 

bands are related to the structural surface of the aluminium minerals and this feature is 

widely used to distinguish similar aluminium phases. For gibbsite the Raman spectrum 

in the high frequency region exhibited four strong sharp peaks at 3358, 3431, 3522, and 

3615 cm-1 (Figure 4b) which is ascribed to OH gibbsite groups. This result is in line 

with Huneke et al. (1980) and Ruan et al. (2002). In addition, Gb spectrum reveals 

several picks in the low-medium frequency region (150 – 1050 cm-1) with strong 

doublet at 541/572 cm-1 and a narrow intense peak at 324 cm-1 followed by weak bands 

between 200 and 450 cm-1 frequency. Three shoulders can be also observed at ?308, 
~360, and ?507 cm-1 (Figure 4a). Probably, the main peaks are due to Al-O vibration 
group, and the minor bands in the low-frequency regions arise from vibrational motions 

of hydroxyls, lattice modes, and vibrations of hydrogen bonds as argued by Rogers 

(1993), and references therein.

and without As(V). a, Gb and Al(OH)3 spectra in the 150 – 1050 region; b, Gb and 
Al(OH)3 spectra in the 3000 – 3800 region. Inset in panel a represents the remaining 
band after subtraction of the Raman spectrum of Gb with and without As loaded. 



 14

By subtracting the Raman spectrum of pure gibbsite from As(V)-gibbsite sorption 

product one, a broad band at ?867 cm-1 was obtained (Figure 4a, inset) . This band 
positions lay close to that reported by Goldberg and Johnston (2001) which observed 

vibrational band in the 874 cm-1 frequency region for As(V) aqueous solution. These 

authors argued that at pH 5.0 the dominant arsenate species is H2AsO4
2- with symmetry 

of C2v, and addressed that band position to As-O vibrational group. Theoretical studies 

have indicated that Al may strongly distort arsenate tetrahedron and the As-OAl 

vibrations should shift to low wavenumbers when compared to the uncomplexed 

arsenate. FTIR spectra of arsenate in poorly crystalline Al-arsenate supported this 

statement and showed that the As-OAl vibrations shifted to 740 cm
-1, whilst the As-

Ouncomplexed exhibited a broad band at 887 cm
-1 (Myneni et al., 1998, and reference 

therein). The presence of adsorbed As(V) enhanced the vibrational stretching of the OH 

units and seems to have slightly contributed to diminish the luminescence of the pure 

Gb spectrum. 

Raman spectrum of the poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 exhibits a broad peak at ~590 

cm-1 which is very close to that reported to Gb at 572 cm-1. Then, it also can be assigned 

to Al-O stretching vibration unit. The presence of adsorbed arsenate is clearly resolved 

by the strong As-O stretching vibration band at ~860 cm-1 (Figure 4a). A band displaced 

of 7 cm-1 is also observed in the As(V)-Al(OH)3 sorption product in relation to pure 

Al(OH)3 spectra. This finding is also in line with Goldberg and Johnston (2001). These 

authors pointed out that the infrared and Raman-active As-O bands in the 844 – 865 cm-1 

region are ascribed to As-O vibration of an inner-sphere Al-O-As complex. In our 

investigation the As-O vibration band lay between this range (~860 cm-1), therefore, we 

can infer that arsenic is strongly retained on Al(OH)3 surface as a very stable surface 

complex.  

For poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide of empirical formula Al(OH)3.3H2O, 

two types of OH groups maybe assumed, one from the OH units and another from 

interlamellar water (OHH2O). Bands at ~3429 cm
-1 is assigned to OH stretching vibration 

of the hydroxyl unit. The enlargement observed on the pure Al(OH)3 line which starts 

from ~1250 up to ~3200 cm-1 may be ascribed to OHH2O units due to water stretching 

bands (Figure 4b). This OHH2O stretching vibrational bands on arsenate-Al(OH)3 

sorption products spectrum depleted notably, evidencing that the adsorption of As(V) 

detached water molecules. It has been shown that the water can be reversibly lost and 

the number of water molecules per formula unit can vary up to 3 (Frost et al., 2006). 



 15

Then, considering the high structural disorder of the poorly crystalline Al(OH)3, the 

exchange of protons between water molecules and arsenate ions is feasible. 

 

3.4.2. Raman spectra for Hm and Fh. Hematite spectrum exhibited narrow peaks 

characteristic of a well crystalline mineral (Figure 5). The positions of the Raman-active 

bands are in good agreement with previous studies (de Faria et al., 1997; Bouchard and 

Smith, 2003; Chamritski and Burns, 2005). Sharp peaks can be observed at 228, 247, 

294, 412, 498, 614, and 1315 cm-1. The band at 660 cm-1 can be attributed to structural 

defects on hematite making it appears as a prohibited line on the Raman spectrum. This 

band is active on infrared spectrum. The weak broad band at ~840 cm-1 could be better 

observed on the subtracted As(V)-loaded hematite spectrum (Figure 5, inset). This band 

is assigned to As-O stretching vibration. Low resolution of this band can be attributed to 

the relative low As(V) adsorption capacity of the Hm in comparison with Fh. This band 

position also lay close that one addressed by Jia et al. (2006) probably as product of 

surface adsorption. No shift was observed on the spectral line due to the presence of 

adsorbed As(V), indicating that the sample remained unchanged evenupon the laser 

beam. 

Similarly to Hm, all diagnostic peaks on the Raman spectrum of the 2-line 

ferrihydrite can be observed at ~368, ~508, ~717, and 1377 cm-1. A shoulder is also 

observed at ~676 cm-1 (Figure 5). These positions of the Raman-active bands agree with 

previous studies carried out by Mazetti and Thistlethwaite (2002). Nevertheless, our 

results differ from that reported by Jia et al. (2006). These authors reported three strong 

narrow peaks at 222, 289, and 407 cm-1. Such pattern would not be expected for poorly 

crystalline minerals which usually exhibit broad and unresolved bands due to their high 

degree of structural disorder. Therefore, this discrepancy may be due to the laser power 

used in the experiment. Laser-induced thermal effect on mineral phases was shown by 

de Faria et al. (1996) who argued that the laser power magnitude is an important 

consideration when interpreting Raman.  

The presence of adsorbed arsenate is clearly resolved by the strong As-O stretching 

vibration band at ~843 cm-1 (Figure 5) and it is in agreement with that observed for As(V)-

hematite spectra (Figure 5, inset). Arsenic vibration band at 845 cm-1 for inner-sphere 

As(V) complex on ferrihydrite surface was reported by Jia et al. (2006). They attributed 

such binding mechanism to that complex since the adsorption of As(V) at pH 8 is assumed 

to be via binuclear complexation. Thus, the same inference may match for these results.

3.4.3. Raman spectra for Gt and Al-substituted goethites. Pure Gt spectrum 

shows narrow peaks characteristic of a well crystalline mineral (Figure 6). Two strong 

can be visualised at 303 and 389 cm-1 followed by other peaks at 248, 485, 549, 687, 

and 1003 cm-1 and two shoulder at 403 and 420 cm-1. A weak peak was also observed at 

205 cm-1 frequency. These peaks position are in perfect agreement with previous 

investigations (de Faria et al., 1997; Oh et al., 1998; Bouchard and Smith, 2003) 

confirming the synthesised goethite. We have not found references to the small peaks at 

low frequencies in the literature, i.e. 169 and 208 cm-1, and that one located at 614 cm-1. 

Consequently, these peaks are probably due to some ambiguous variations in the 

goethite lattice. No arsenate stretching vibrational bands were observed on the As(V)-

loaded goethite (spectrum not shown), which can be ascribed to the lowest As(V) 

adsorption capacity of goethite.

Aluminium substitution in the goethite structure affected considerably its 

vibrational features, especially the resolution of the Raman spectrum. In general, Al had 

a major influence under the degree of crystallinity and under the frequency of the 

spectral bands of the goethite. The main sharp peaks observed on pure Gt spectrum 

were broadened and shifted towards the high frequency region (red shift), as indicated 

by vertical bars in Figure 6. For goethites with higher Al content, the lines are broader 

and the shifts are less pronounced. For instance, the vibrational frequency of the main 

Gt peak at 389 cm-1 shifted to ~406 cm-1, and then to 414 cm-1 as the Al content 

increased to 13 and to 20 cmol mol-1, respectively.  

The relative intensity was also influenced by the presence of structural Al. 

Reduction on the intensity along with the red shift and linewidth resulted in loss and 

overlap of many peaks, especially those observed in the low frequency region of the 

pure Gt spectrum. Iron is a strongly polarising atom and when it is incorporated into 

another mineral lattice it modifies the vibrational properties of the crystal. For example, 

the presence of a small amount of iron in the structure of spharelite enhanced the 

intensity of its second-order Raman spectrum (Mernagh and Trudu, 1993). Hence, a 



 18

counter effect, i.e. substitution of iron in the (hydro)xide lattices by other ions (e.g. Al), 

should result in intensity depletion. The scope of this process occurs gradually as 

suggested by the two shoulders at 445 and 491 cm-1 on the AlGt13 spectrum, probably 

product of the Raman band alterations at 420 and 485 cm-1 on pure Gt spectrum.  

In general, the presence of arsenate phase adsorbed on Al-substituted goethites 

can be visualised at ~847 cm-1 frequency on the As(V)-AlGt Raman spectra (Figure 6). 

Even though arsenate band on the As(V)-AlGt Raman spectrum is more pronounced as 

structural Al increase, arsenate seems to be more associated with iron than aluminium, 

since the As(V)-AlGt band positions are much closer to those verified for Hm (~840) 

and Fh (~843) than those observed for Gb (~867 cm-1) and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 

(~860 cm-1). Similar to other Raman spectra analysed herein , these bands are also 

ascribed to As-O stretching vibrational group.  

The Raman technique also revealed that AlGt13 sample is rather heterogeneous. 

The well resolved Raman-active band at ~680 cm-1 is characteristic of magnetite, formed 

during the synthesis, as argued earlier. This band appears wider and somewhat shifted 

concerning to that one observed at 670 cm-1 for pure magnetite (Gasparov et al., 2000; 

Chamritski and Burns, 2005). Fe3O4 has an inverse spinel, cubic unit cell, and there are 

two iron position in the magnetite structure: A positions characterised by tetrahedral 

oxygen surrounding the Fe ions, which is occupied only by Fe3+; whereas the octahedral 

B positions can be occupied by Fe2+ and Fe3+ (Gasparov et al., 2000). Thus, substitution 

of Al3+ for tetrahedral Fe3+ is feasible to occur, as discussed previously (section 3.2.1). 

As these modifications are the same of those verified for AlGts, i.e. increase in 

frequency and linewidth, we infer that Al is also incorporated in the magnetite lattice. 

 

3.4.4. Raman spectra for Magnetite and phase transformation. In order to 

confirm the presence of co-precipitated magnetite and to investigate the laser-induced 

thermal effect giving rise to magnetite phase transformation, the laser was set at a 

darker region on the sample. The Raman-active bands observed at 190, 315, and 680 

cm-1 confirmed the co-occurrence of magnetite with AlGt13. The peak at ~670 cm
-1 is 

assigned to A1g mode which has a higher frequency than Eg mode and is addressed to 

the stretching vibrations of the oxygen atoms along the Fe(A)-O bonds (Gasparov et al., 

2000). Similarly to that observed on the AlGt13 spectrum, the main magnetite Raman-

active peak at ~680 cm-1 present a red shift of approximately ~10 cm-1 as well as a 

broad shape (Figure 7). The main peaks that should appear at 400 to 550 cm-1 on typical

Figure 7 – Raman spectra of magnetite before and after thermal treatment. Pure 
hematite spectrum was plotted in order to compare with heated magnetite spectrum.  

 

 

magnetite spectrum (Gasparov et al., 2000; Chamritski and Burns, 2005) were lost due 

to spectral modifications on the linewidth. This lack can be ascribed to the presence of 

Al in the magnetite lattice.  

In relation to thermal treatment, magnetite showed to be very sensitive. After 

three seconds of higher laser irradiation, magnetite transformed completely into 

hematite-like phase, as shown in Figure 7. Nevertheless, the hematite-like spectrum 

obtained after heating the magnetite crystal differs from that recorded for pure hematite. 

All Raman-active bands on the hematite-like spectrum presented a red shift as well as a 

decrease in relative intensity. Considering that Al is not lost during the heat process, 

these changes can be also ascribed to the presence of structural Al replacing iron. 

Hematite-like spectrum presented a red shift (40 cm-1) in the higher frequency region 

(&gt;1300 cm-1) in comparison with pure Hm one (Figure 7). For natural and synthetic 

Hm, the band at 411 cm-1 is particularly sensitive to variations caused by hydration, by 

ion substitution, or by the temperature of the sample (Bouchard and Smith, 2003). 



 20

Indeed, this band is displaced on Hm-like spectra, but our data suggest that the band at 

the higher frequency region seems to be most sensitive to such variations. 

 

 

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Raman spectroscopy and complementary XRD and diffuse reflectance were used 

to characterise different Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, to investigate the influence of 

structural Al in the goethite vibrational features as well as to identify the arsenate phase 

formed on the mineral surfaces. Spectroscopic results of the synthesised mineral phases 

fairly agreed with previous data reported in the literature. The presence of aluminium 

increased greatly the specific surface area of the goethite and improved its efficiency in 

adsorbing As(V). In addition, aluminium distorted considerably the spectroscopic 

patterns of the goethite mostly displacing its spectral lines due to change in its unit cell 

parameters. Raman spectroscopy was the major technique to reveal the structural 

disorder caused by Al in the Gt properties. Furthermore, this technique was sensible to 

detect As(V) adsorbed on the mineral surfaces, mainly on poorly crystalline Al(OH3) 

and ferrihydrite. Raman spectra in general revealed well resolved bands between 800 

and 915 cm-1 frequencies, addressed to As-O stretching vibrational groups. The 

presence of arsenate was not visualised for Gt and rather slightly observed for Hm 

probably due to their lower As(V) adsorption capacities. As a general observation, our 

results agree that arsenic is retained as inner-sphere complex on poorly crystalline 

Al(OH)3, Fh, and AlGts. But for Gb and Hm a lesser stable complex seems to 

predominate due to evidence of precipitation on their surface. The presence of 

coprecipitated magnetite was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. 

Evidence of aluminium replacing iron even in the magnetite lattice was supported by 

modifications on its main spectral band along with the laser-induced Hm-like Raman 

spectrum. 

In soils, goethite is the most stable ferric mineral and generally present 

appreciable amount of incorporated Al in its lattice, then, the immobilisation of 

contaminants, i.e. arsenate, may to a certain extent to be more associated with Al-

substituted goethites than to other pure crystalline Fe (hydr)oxides. Although poorly 

crystalline Fe hydroxides participates more efficiently in sorption processes due to their 

larger surface area and consequently higher number of reactive surface sites, they are 

primarily dissolved via bioreduction reactions under anoxic conditions (low Eh), 



 21

resulting in arsenic mobilisation. In contrast, the presence of structural Al is expected to 

enhance the stability of goethites face to reductive dissolution. Consequently, the 

dissolution-desorption mechanisms is limited in Al-substituted goethite, contributing to 

prevent the arsenic dispersion. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to better 

understand the role of aluminium in the sorption mechanisms and in the stability of the 

binding complex formed between arsenic and goethite surface under environmental 

conditions. 

Raman spectroscopy in association with other techniques figures as an important 

tool to identify and characterise individual minerals. This is relevant in environmental 

sciences, which deal with complex matrixes, generally composed by an assemblage of 

minerals. Especially Al and Fe (hydr)oxides and their anion sorption products which 

can be assessed since each anion has its own vibrational stretching bands. Additionally, 

it is possible to detect the occurrence of ion substitutions that contribute to modify the 

mineral features.

ARSENIC ADSORPTION ONTO ALUMINIUM AND IRON (HYDR)OXIDES: 
KINETICS, ISOTHERM AND ENVELOPE OF ADSORPTION 

 
 

ABSTRACT 

The geochemical fates of iron and arsenic are so closely correlated that methods 
of arsenic removal from water are in general based on the high affinity of this metalloid 
with iron (hydr)oxides. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential 
of Al-substituted goethites in adsorbing arsenic compared with other Fe and Al 
(hydr)oxides. Hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), gibbsite (Gb), 
aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and three Al-substituted goethites containing 13, 20, and 
23 cmol mol of Al (AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23, respectively) were synthesised and used 
as adsorbent for As(V). Adsorption kinetics at two different solid:solution ratios, 2.0 and 
5.0 g L-1, and adsorption isotherms were obtained after equilibrating the samples with 
arsenate solution for respectively 96 and 24 hours under constant shaking. As(V) 
adsorption maxima was measured at different pH ranging from 3 to 9. In spite of the fast 
equilibrium, the increase in solid concentration limited the efficiency and velocity of 
arsenic adsorption. The As(V) adsorption maxima decreased in the following order: 
Al(OH)3 &gt; Fh &gt; AlGt13 &gt; AlGt20 &gt; AlGt23 &gt; Gb &gt; Hm &gt; Gt. Nevertheless, by calculating 
adsorption capacities in terms of surface area, Gb, Gt, and Hm showed higher As(V) 
loading capacity than Fh. This suggest available reactive sites not fully occupied by 
arsenate on the amorphous and Al-substituted (hydr)oxides during the adsorption 
experiment. No relationship was observed between average particle size and adsorption 
maxima. This suggests re-aggregation of the particles during the particle size 
measurement, or imperfections on the surface of the particles increasing their net charge, 
resulting in high adsorption density. The behaviour of all samples was dependent on pH, 
and the maximum adsorption was achieved in slightly acidic conditions. In general, Al 
(hydr)oxides were more efficient than Fe (hydr)oxides to remove As(V). The presence 
of structural Al enhanced considerably the arsenic uptake capacity of the goethites 
which showed to be promising as an adsorbent to remove arsenic from water.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Arsenic contamination has been considered an important and very sensitive issue 

due to its high toxicity to man and other living organisms. The current World Health 

Organization (WHO) guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 µg L-1. This limit is 

recommended by WHO based on toxicological test and was already adopted in many 

countries, such as Brazil, United State of America, Germany, and others. In Australia, 

the drink water guideline value for As is 7 µg L-1 (NHMRC &amp;amp; NRMMC, 2004). 

Nevertheless, the presence of arsenic in ground and surface water has been found in 

values higher than this threshold. 

Some parts of Bangladesh, West Bengal, Inner Mongolia, Vietnam, India, 

Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil are well known regions with anomalous levels of 

As in drinking water (Matschullat et al., 2000; Smedley and Kinninburg, 2002; Smedley 

et al., 2003). Weathering of As-rich parental material and human activities, such as use 

of arsenical fertilizers and pesticides as well as industrial and mining activities are 

prominent contamination source. In Brazil, in the past, an estimated 3.1 million metric 

tons of tailing materials with average As content of 14,500 mg kg-1 have been deposited 

along valleys without adequate assessment of environmental impact (Deschamps et al., 

2002). Moreover, previous studies in these areas revealed a naturally high As 

background, with average As concentrations above 100 mg kg-1 in soils and 100 µg L-1 

in local water (Matschullat et al., 2000; Deschamps et al., 2002; Mello et al., 2006). 

The biogeochemical cycle of arsenic has been reviewed by Anderson and Bruland 

(1991), Schnoor (1996), Matschullat (2000), Smedley and Kinniburg (2002), and others. 

The distribution of arsenic species in the environment depends primarily on redox 

potential (Eh) and pH (e.g. H3AsO4/H2AsO4
- pKa1 = 2.2; H2AsO4

-/HAsO4
2- pKa2 = 6.9; 

HAsO4
2-/AsO4

3- pKa3 = 11.4). In well-oxidised water, arsenate [As(V)] as H2AsO4
- and 

HAsO4
2- is the predominant species while arsenite [As(III)] occur predominately in 

reduced environments mainly as H3AsO3. Nevertheless, both species can be often found 

in either redox environment due to relatively slow transformation on the redox 

conditions. 

Sorption processes also play an important role on As behaviour controlling its 

mobility and bioavailability. Hydroxyl groups (OH and OH2) in the coordination 

spheres of metals on the mineral surfaces are the most abundant and reactive adsorption 

sites. Consequently Al and Fe (hydr)oxides have a strong affinity for As(V) (Pierce and 

Moore, 1982; Stumm and Sulzberger, 1992). The strong retention of As(V) by oxides

and hydroxides is ascribed to inner-sphere mononuclear or binuclear monodentate-

bidentate surface complexes (Waychunas et al., 1993; Sun and Doner, 1996; Fendorf et 

al., 1997). 

There are many different technologies for removing arsenic from drinking water. 

Precipitation/coagulation or adsorption processes have been preferably considered at the 

water plant treatment. A number of investigation has focused on using aluminium and 

ferric salts (Jekel, 1994; Wickramasinghe et al., 2004) and natural or synthetic Fe or Al 

(hydr)oxides (Anderson et al., 1976; Driehaus et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., 2001; García-

Sanchez et al., 2002; Deschamps et al., 2003; Ladeira and Ciminelli 2004; Deschamps 

et al., 2005). The use of aluminium or ferric salts as a coagulant can lead to parallels 

problems regards to the addition of undesirable anion, such as sulphate, nitrate, and 

chloride into the water. Other problems associated with this technique are the safe 

separation and the handling of the contaminated coagulant sludge (Driehaus et al., 

1998).  

The adsorption technique has secured a place in advanced methods of arsenic 

removal because of the easy handling of the sludge, free operation and regeneration 

capability. For this reason, metal (hydr)oxides have been studied by many researchers 

with regards to the developing technologies for arsenic removal from contaminated 

water. These materials include amorphous ferric hydroxides (Pierce and Moore, 1982), 

granular ferric hydroxides (GFH) (Driehaus et al., 1998), crystalline ferric hydroxide 

(Manna et al., 2003), amorphous aluminium hydroxides (Anderson et al., 1976), natural 

Fe and Mn minerals (Deschamps et al., 2003, 2005), activated alumina (Singh and Pant, 

2004; Sierra-Alvarez et al., 2005). In general, methods using Fe (salt) are more effective 

than Al in removing As from water. Nevertheless, Fe (hydr)oxides used to remove As 

from water are rather unstable in low Eh environments. Thus, under reducing 

conditions, the mechanism of arsenic sorption may also depend on Fe reduction 

(Cummings et al., 1999). 

The disposal of Fe-As-rich waste generated at water treatments plants is an 

environmental concern, and requires the development of methods to improve the 

stability of these compounds under anaerobic conditions. Previous investigations have 

suggested a positive correlation between goethite stability under reducing conditions 

and structural Al content (Schwertmann, 1991; Maurice et al., 2000; Gonzales et al., 

2002). In this study we assessed the potential of Al-substituted goethites in adsorbing 

arsenate in comparison to other Al and Fe (hydr)oxides.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Adsorbents 

Aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides were synthesised, and the main characteristics of 

all adsorbents are in Table 1. Hematite, Goethite, and 2-line Ferrihydrite were 

synthesised following the procedure described in Schwertmann and Cornell (2000). A 

series of aluminium substituted goethites were also synthesised following the methods 

therein. The Al-goethites were prepared by precipitation of ferrous and aluminium 

chloride solution with potassium hydroxide solution and aged in a plastic bottle during 

90 days. Slow oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al3+ in the goethite structure 

were achieved by opening the bottle daily and stirring the suspension vigorously during 

five minutes. In order to remove the excess of Al, the precipitates were washed twice 

with 0.01 mol L-1 KOH solution. Precipitates of (hydr)oxides were washed several times 

with Milli-Q water, centrifuged and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air circulation, except 

for ferrihydrite which was freeze-dried Gibbsite was prepared following the procedures 

outlined in Kyle et al. (1975). An Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with a 4 mol L
-1 NaOH 

solution to a pH of 4.6 ±0.2. The gelatinous precipitate was heated for two hours at 40 
oC, then washed twice, dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 36 days, and dried at 50 oC. 

Poorly aluminium hydroxide was also prepared from an aluminium nitrate solution by 

precipitation with 4 mol L-1 NaOH solution. The procedure was similar to that followed 

for the synthesis of gibbsite, but with the suppression of the heating step to preserve low 

crystallinity. Similarly to ferrihydrite, the aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in 

order to prevent its crystallization.  

Prior to any analysis, all samples were passed through the &amp;lt;53 µm sieve. The 

specific surface area was determined by N2 adsorption, BET method, using multiple 

point technique (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000) and particle size was measured 

using a Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200. The identity of the desired mineral 

phases were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and 

diffuse reflectance for the iron (hydr)oxides. Additional details can be seen on Silva et 

al. (2008).  

 

2.2. Adsorption Isotherms. Batch experiments were carried out to obtain 

adsorption isotherms at pH 5.0 ±0.2 and 25 ±0.1 oC. As(V) solutions were prepared 

dissolving in Milli-Q water analytical reagent grade di-sodium hydrogen arsenate 

heptahydrate (Na2HAsO4 7H2O; Ajax Finechem). Solid samples (0.1000g)  and  25  mL

of As solution (concentrations ranging from 0.534 up to 21.586 mmol L-1) were placed into 

a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with screw caps and conical base, and equilibrated 

for 24 hours on a rotary shaker. The pH was checked at the first four hours and corrected 

when necessary. The ionic strength was set at 10 mmol L-1 using CaCl2. After 24 h the 

samples were then centrifuged and syringe filtered using 0.22 µm membrane filters 

(Millipore Millex-GV, USA). The filtered was acidified and stored for further As analyses.  

 

2.3. As(V) Adsorption Kinetics. The As(V) adsorption kinetics were assessed at two 

different solid:solution ratios, i.e. 2.0 and 5.0 g L-1, and at initial As(V) concentration 

corresponding to 0.100, 0.200, 0.250, 0.400, 1.200, and 1.500 mmol g-1 of Gt, Hm, Gb, 

AlGts, Fh, and Al(OH)3, respectively. Preliminary test showed that these concentrations 

were close to maximum As(V) adsorption. An arsenate stock solution was prepared in 10 

mmol L-1 CaCl2 containing As concentration of 13.35 mmol L
-1. Adsorption kinetics were 

obtained at pH 5.0 ±0.2 by equilibrating the solid sample (0.0500 g or 0.1250 g) with 25 

mL of doped solution for 96 h at 25 ±0.1 oC. Solutions with adequate As(V) concentration 

for each adsorbent were placed into a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with screw 

caps and conical base, and equilibrated on a rotary shaker. During the first four hours, pH 

was checked and corrected when necessary with HNO3 or NaOH. The ionic strength was 

set at 10 mmol L-1 using CaCl2. Aliquots of the supernatants were periodically collected at 

0.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h of reaction, and immediately syringe filtered using 0.22 µm 



 32

membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA), acidified, and stored for further As 

analyses.  

 

2.4. As(V) Adsorption Envelopes. Adsorption envelopes were obtained by 

adsorption isotherm at different pre-adjusted pH values ranging from 3 to 9. The pH was 

adjusted by adding HNO3 or NaOH. The pH was measured and adjusted during the first 

four hours when necessary and at the end of the experiment. In addition, blank experiments 

containing only arsenic solution were used to measure the amount of arsenic adsorbed by 

the walls of the reaction vessels. 

 

2.5. Analytical Techniques. Arsenic in the equilibrium solutions was measured by 

inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a Perkin 

Elmer Optima 3300 DV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for instrumental 

instabilities and matrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the solution to reach a 

final concentration of 2.0 mg L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.134 µmol L-1 As were 
obtained. All assays were carried out in triplicates. 

 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Adsorption Isotherms. The different arsenate concentration ranges added were 

sufficient to achieve the maximum adsorption for all adsorbents (Figure 1). Adsorption 

isotherm taking into account the whole data fitted well to Langmuir model. Nevertheless, 

different adsorption regions can be clearly visualised for Hm, Fh, Gb, and AlGt20. It is 

determined that these are related to the affinity of arsenate for at least two distinct 

energetically reactive sites on their surface. 

In order to obtain the maximum arsenate adsorption, the data were fitted to the linear 

form of the Langmuir equation [C/q = (1/Kb) + (C/b)], where C is the equilibrium 

concentration of As(V) remaining in the solution (mmol L-1), q is the amount of adsorbed 

arsenate by the sorbent (mmol g-1), b is the maximum arsenic adsorption (mmol g-1), and K 

is the constant related to the energy of adsorption (L mmol-1). It was utilised the second 

region of adsorption as preconised by Muljadi et al. (1966) for phosphate. According  to

these authors, the second region of the isotherm is the best suited to Langmuir’s 

presupposition. Experimental data presented a good fit to the Langmuir equation, with 

correlation coefficient (r2) values higher than 0.99 (Table 2). 

Incorporation of Al in the goethite structure favoured the adsorption of As(V) in 

relation to pure goethite, and other crystalline phases, i.e. Hm and Gb. According to 

Schulze and Schwertmann (1987) goethite crystals become smaller as Al-substitution 

increases, changing its structure from polydomainic crystals to smaller monodomainic ones. 

Likewise, the incorporation of aluminium can also lead to structural defects with cation 

deficiency in the goethite framework (Gonzales et al. 2002) that contributes to increase the 

number of surface reactive sites, which is in agreement with their relatively large surface 

areas. Even though a large arsenate adsorption had been observed on AlGts, the Langmuir 

adsorption maxima (b) somewhat diminished with further increases in Al:Fe molar ratio 

(Table 2). This suggest a higher affinity between As and structural iron at the AlGts surface 

as reflected by the increase in As adsorbed per mol of iron. Decreasing of arsenate 

adsorption with the increase of structural Al was reported by Masue et al. (2007) to 

coprecipitated Al:Fe hydroxides. On the other hand, the lower As(V) adsorption capacity 

could be attributed to fewer surface reactive hydroxyls or water groups in well crystallised 

Hm, Gb, and pure Gt. Our results for maximum As(V) adsorptions agree well with the 

findings of previous work: poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxides of approximately 1.6 

mmol g-1 at pH 5 (Anderson et al., 1976; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002), goethite ranging 

from 0.04 up to 0.186 mmol g-1 with maximum pH at 3.0 (Manning and Goldberg, 1996; 

Liu and Violante, 2001), and ferrihydrite from 1.0 to &gt;2.6 mmol g-1 at pH 5 (Fuller et al., 

1993; Raven et al., 1998; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002). 

Spectroscopic investigations, i.e. FTIR, EXAFS, XANES, have shown that arsenate 

adsorption on ferric compounds occur via ligand exchange with OH and OH2 groups 

forming inner-sphere mono or binuclear complexes (Manceau, 1995; Sun and Doner, 1996; 

Fendorf et al., 1997; Grossl et al., 1997; Sherman and Randall, 2003; Makris et al., 2007). 

EXAFS studies have shown that arsenate adsorption on ferrihydrite and goethite occurs 

predominantly as bidentate bridging complex and the formation of monodentate surface 

occurs to only at a limited extent and low surface coverage (Waychunas et al., 1993; 

Fendorf et al., 1997). The formation of stable complexes has been also  reported  for

aluminium hydroxides and gibbsite (Foster et al., 1998; Ladeira et al., 2001; Goldberg and 

Johnson, 2001; Arai and Sparks, 2002; Liu et al., 2006). Therefore, these complexes have 

likely been formed in our materials. However, further spectroscopic evidences are 

warranted to certificate the type of surface complexes preferentially formed at our 

conditions. 

Calculated K values from the Langmuir function showed the following order: AlGt20 

&gt; AlGt13 &gt; AlGt23 &gt; Gt &gt; Gb &gt; Al(OH)3 &gt; Hm ? Fh. Though the empirical K values has 

little or no significance as a theoretical chemical binding constant, this constant is rather 

useful for assessing comparative adsorption behaviour of different materials (Lafferty and 

Loeppert, 2005). In general, the crystalline adsorbents demonstrated higher arsenate 

retention capacity than poorly crystalline ones, except for Hm which K value laid close to 

Fh. Higher K values for Gt than Fh indicates its relative strong retention capacity for 

arsenate. Similar results were reported by Dixit and Hering (2003) and Lafferty and 

Loeppert (2005). Al-substituted goethites demonstrated higher affinity in adsorbing arsenic 

than pure Gt suggesting that incorporation of Al affect positively the interaction between 

arsenic and iron (hydr)oxides, however, no trend was observed between K value and Al 

content. Masue et al. (2007) also observed strong retention capacity of arsenate to 

coprecipitated Al:Fe hydroxides, but the affinity decreased as Al:Fe molar ratio was 

increased.  



 36

The maximum As(V) adsorption capacity decreased in the following order: Al(OH)3 

&gt; Fh &gt; AlGt13 &gt; AlGt20 &gt; AlGt23 &gt; Gb &gt; Hm &gt; Gt. The higher amount of arsenate adsorbed 

by poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and Fh could be attributed to their considerably larger 

specific surface area. The higher adsorption efficiency verified for Al(OH)3 in comparison 

with Fh was also reported by Garcia-Sanchez et al. (2002). They attributed such results to 

different types of isotherm as classified by Giles et al (1960) (see also in Garcia-Sanchez et 

al., 2002). According to these authors adsorption isotherms for poorly crystalline 

aluminium hydroxides is H (high affinity) while for Fh is L (Langmuirian) type. This mean 

that aluminium hydroxides initially has such a strong affinity for As(V) that in short time 

the anions are almost completely adsorbed in diluted solutions. As the sites in aluminium 

hydroxides surface are occupied, it becomes increasingly more difficult for As(V) anions to 

react to empty active sites in the adsorbent. On the other hand, this adsorption pattern was 

not observed for Fh, being slower and likely taking place in two steps. Fuller et al. (1993) 

also observed an initial rapid adsorption rate of arsenate on ferrihydrite followed by a much 

slower kinetic due to a diffusion-controlled rate-determining step.  

In general, the AlGts showed high As(V) loading capacity per mol of Fe being 3.2 

and 5.4 times higher than Hm and pure Gt, respectively, but 2.5 times smaller than Fh 

(Table 2). 

Normalized adsorption data by surface area demonstrated that the arsenate loading 

capacity was similar to Gb, Hm, and Gt followed by Fh and somewhat lower for AlGts 

(Figure 2). These results indicated that surface sites for Fh were not fully occupied by 

As(V) anions, as we obtained an adsorption density (? 0.13 mol mol-1 Fe) lower than the 
maximum stated to Fh by Dixit and Hering (2003) and reference therein, i.e. 0.25 mol mol-1 

Fe at pH near to 4.6. This behaviour could be attributed to the relative short time frame 

adopted herein (24 h), therefore, our result is consistent with previous reported data, 

ranging from 0.11 up to 0.14 mol mol-1 Fe (Ferguson and Anderson, 1974; Raven et al., 

1998; Pierce and Moore, 1982). 

 

3.2. As(V) Adsorption kinetics. Adsorption kinetics of As(V) followed two different 

phase patterns (Figure 3). An initial fast phase corresponding to adsorption in the first 

couple of hours, and then, a slower phase from 2 to 92 hours. This finding is in line  with

those reported previously (Fuller et al., 1993; Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001). According to 

Hongshao and Stanforth (2001) adsorption in the first phase corresponds to irreversibly 

bound ion, while further slowly adsorbed ions are weakly bounded and easily exchanged by 

a competing anion, e.g. phosphate, silicate, and carbonate, etc. Many mechanisms are 

thought to be related to the second phase, such as precipitation on the surface, diffusion into 

surface pores or in the adsorbent matrix, formation of a solid-solution on the surface, or 

coagulation of the adsorbent particles. Though we have no spectroscopic evidence, we 

suppose that anion-induced dissolution (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001) and diffusion-

controlled (Raven et al., 1998; Fuller et al., 1993) mechanisms played the main role on As 

sequestration by the mineral surfaces over the time. Since an anion is adsorbed in a 

nonexchangeable form during initial phase, it can act as sorption sites for dissolved Al and, 

or, Fe. This causes a decrease in the dissolved concentration of these cations at the external 

solution, which along with the presence of anions in solution induce more aluminium and, 

or, iron to dissolve from the solid matrices. The attached Al or Fe in turns adsorbs more 

arsenate from external solution to form a surface precipitate. In addition, diffusion into

mineral particle should be also taking into account mainly for Fh and AlGts due to their 

elevated degree of structural disorder. This hypothesis is based upon the time dependence 

which is well characterised in our experiment, i.e. a rapid equilibrium being attained in the 

subset of surface sites located near the exterior of aggregates, as stated by Fuller et al. 

(1993). The ionic substitution of Al for Fe in the structure of goethite has a marked effect 



 39

on goethite properties. Variations in crystal size, shape and surface area, structural OH 

content, and dissolution behaviour were observed due to Al for Fe substitution in goethite 

structure (Murad and Schwertmann, 1983; Schwertmann, 1984; Schulze and Schwertmann, 

1987; Torrent et al., 1987; Jeanroy et al., 1991). 

For the smaller solid:solution ratio, 2.0 g L-1, As(V) adsorption was over 94 % during 

the time frame. The increase in solid concentration affected arsenic removal by most 

adsorbents, especially, Gt and Hm, which efficiencies were depleted from ?98 and ?95 % 
to ?70 and ?78 %, respectively (Figures 1a and 1b). The decrease in adsorption density was 
consistent with visual observation that clearly indicated increasingly aggregation of goethite 

particles at higher solid concentrations. Although no visual aggregation was verified for the 

other adsorbents, we suppose that this phenomenon might have also happened, limiting 

As(V) adsorption at higher solid concentrations. 

 

3.3. As(V) Adsorption Envelopes. Changes in the pH affected the sorption process 

of As(V) anions by Al and Fe (hydr)oxides (Figure 4), as widely reported in the literature 

(Anderson et al., 1976; Pierce and Moore, 1982; Manning and Goldberg, 1997; Lafferty 

and Loeppert, 2005; Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2002; Deschamps et al., 2003; Masue et al., 

2007). In general maximum adsorption was obtained at pH range from 3.5 up to 5.5. Under 

such conditions, the monovalent anion (H2AsO4
- ) is the dominant species. This implies that 

As(V) adsorption may be described by surface complexation models involving ligand 

exchange of surface hydroxyl groups, mainly with the surface OH2 rather than surface OH 

groups. Low pH causes protonation of –OH-1/2 groups to OH2
+1/2, which facilitate the ligand 

exchange since H2O is easier to detach from metal binding sites than OH (McBride, 1994). 

In this case the dissociation of H+ from H3AsO4 also is considered to contribute to both, the 

protonation of surface OH groups and the increase of negatively charged adsorbate 

(H2AsO4
-). These effects, however, are counterbalanced by the decrease in the net positive 

charge as the pH increases to the point of zero charge (pHPZC).  

In general, the adsorption envelope followed a similar trend, indicating similar 

arsenate adsorption mechanism for all materials. It is worth of note, a more pronounced 

decrease in As(V) retention as the pH approaches to the second pK of the arsenic acid 

(pKa2 = 6.9). It is well known that specific adsorption affects the surface net  charge,

conditioning the pHPZC to a lower value. For example, Anderson et al. (1976) observed that 

the pHPZC of aluminium hydroxides decreased from 8.5 to 4.6 after loaded with arsenate. 

For ferrihydrite, Jain et al. (1999) reported a decrease of 2.4 pH unit, from 8.5 to 6.1. A 

similar observation was reported by Ladeira and Ciminelli (2004) for goethite and gibbsite. 

This behaviour is also expected to other iron (hydr)oxides due to arsenate adsorption. 

Thereby, the decrease in arsenate adsorption as the pH rises can be due to two interacting 

factors: the decrease of positive net surface charge and the attachment of adsorbate which 

creates additional negative surface charges inducing repulsion of As(V) anions in the 

external solution and increasingly occupy available sites for adsorption. 

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

The results clearly show that incorporation of structural Al into goethite minerals 

increases arsenate adsorption capacity. AlGts presented As(V) adsorption capacities almost 



 41

4 times higher than pure goethite. Arsenate adsorption onto Al and Fe (hydr)oxides is 

strongly influenced by pH, in a such way that maximum adsorption is achieved at slightly 

acidic conditions. Arsenate retention patterns suggested formation of stable, probably inner-

sphere binuclear complexes, involving ligand exchange with the OH2 groups. 

Notwithstanding, further spectroscopic studies are warranted to certificate the type of 

surface complexes are preferentially formed between As(V) and Al-substituted goethites. 

In spite of the preference for iron in water treatment processes, aluminium 

(hydr)oxides revealed to be more efficient in adsorbing soluble As(V). Maximum 

adsorption of arsenate was higher on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 than on ferrihydrite. 

Similarly, gibbsite presented higher As(V) adsorption than hematite or goethite. Al-

substituted goethites showed intermediate adsorption efficiency and can be considered 

promising materials to remove arsenic from contaminated water.

EFFECT OF BACTERIAL IRON REDUCTION AND COMPETING ION ON 
ARSENIC MOBILISATION  

 
 

ABSTRACT 

Arsenic mobility is controlled by iron and aluminium oxides in most environment, 
therefore, the use of these minerals in water treatment plants for removing arsenic has been 
investigated extensively. In anoxic environment dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria plays a 
fundamental role in catalysing the redox transformations that ultimately control the 
mobility of As in aquatic environment. Thus, we investigated the stability of arsenic 
retained by aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions in the presence of 
Shawanella putrefaciens cells, and phosphate or carbonate as competing anions. As(V) 
loaded samples of synthetic hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), 2-line ferrihydrite (Fh), gibbsite 
(Gb), aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3], and three Al-substituted goethites containing 13, 20, 
and 23 cmol mol-1 of Al (AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23, respectively) were anaerobically 
incubated under N2 atmosphere and periodically sampled to evaluate the contents of soluble 
As in the supernatants. It was found that S. putrefaciens cells were able to bind on mineral 
surfaces and utilise both noncrystalline and crystalline iron (hydr)oxides as electron 
acceptor releasing arsenic into solution. Al-substituted goethites presented a decrease in the 
fraction of soluble iron and mobilised arsenic as structural Al increased. The expected 
relationship between specific surface area and reductive dissolution of Fe and As was also 
affected by the increment in structural Al. Phosphate and carbonate affected the kinetics of 
iron reduction due to precipitation of soluble iron as metastable mineral phases (e.g. 
vivianite and siderite). It seems that analogous mineral phases of phosphates served as a 
sink for As limiting its mobilisation. Phosphate competed strongly with arsenate and its 
efficiency seemed to be governed by the nature of the binding mechanism between As and 
adsorbent surface. Higher fraction of arsenic was desorbed by phosphate from gibbsite 
followed by AlGts. Conversely, only Gb showed significant amounts of arsenate displaced 
by carbonate. In spite of low crystallinity, Al(OH)3 was the most efficient in retaining 
arsenate on its surface followed by Fh and Hm. 

 
Keywords: biological reduction, arsenate, phosphate, carbonate, Al-substituted 

goethite, Al and Fe hydroxides.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Arsenic contamination is an environmental, ecological and health concern. Due to 

new evidences of its carcinogenic effect, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has 

recommended to reduce the maximum arsenic level from 50 to 10 ?g L-1 in drinking water. 
This regulatory limit has been adopted by many countries. Therefore, development of new 

technologies for arsenic removal from water has currently been a challenge to researchers 

worldwide. The input of arsenic in the environment is attributed to natural and 

anthropogenic sources which are related to weathering of As-bearing rocks, leakage of As-

rich thermal waters to shallow aquifers, mining and smelting activity, pesticides and wood 

preservative uses, as well as its use as growth promoter for animals (Matschullat, 2000; 

Smedley and Kinniburg, 2002). 

In aquatic environment arsenic can be found as inorganic and organic compounds, in 

several valence states, i.e. -3, -1, 0, +3, and +5. In natural water arsenic occurs mainly in 

inorganic forms as trivalent arsenite [As(III)] (as H3AsO3) or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)] 

(as H2AsO4
- and HAsO4

2-). In addition, in marine waters and lakes arsenic can undergo 

microbial methylation and both As(III) and As(V) can coexist with monomethilarsonic acid 

(MMA), and dimethilarsinic acid (DMA). Furthermore, redox potential (Eh) and pH control 

the distribution of arsenic species (e.g. H3AsO4/H2AsO4
- pKa1 = 2.2; H2AsO4

-/HAsO4
2- pKa2 

= 6.9; HAsO4
2-/AsO4

3- pKa3 = 11.4). As(III) is expected to be the dominant species in 

anoxic conditions, but because of relatively slow transformation on the redox conditions, 

both species, As(III) or As(V), can be often found in either redox environment. 

The aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous reactive constituents of soil, 

sediments and aquifers. Due to high reactivity they play a fundamental role on the 

biogeochemical cycle of many elements (e.g. P, S, As, Pb, etc.). For this reason, the 

distribution of arsenic is mostly controlled by both, Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, in most 

oxidised environment, and the main technologies to remove arsenic from contaminated 

water are based on coagulation/precipitation or adsorption processes involving aluminium 

or ferric compounds. General experience has shown that aluminium salts are less efficient 

than ferric ones to remove arsenic from water. McNeil and Edwards (1997) reported that 

when ferric coagulants are added at water treatment plants, most of the Fe3+ precipitates as 

insoluble ferric hydroxide. In aluminium precipitation, however, a significant portion of the 



 50

added Al3+ remains as soluble complexes. Then, because only particulate metal hydroxides 

can mediate arsenic removal, alum plants must carefully consider aluminium solubility 

when arsenic removal is required in water treatment plants.  

Although ferric compounds have lower solubility in relation to aluminium ones, they 

are unstable under low Eh conditions. In the absence of oxygen, Fe(III) minerals can be 

used as electron acceptor during microbial respiration (Lovley et al., 2004). In this process, 

bacteria coupled hydrogen and organic carbon oxidation to the reduction of Fe(III). 

Therefore, based on the association between many trace element and Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, 

and the tendency of these minerals to be dissolved under suboxic conditions, biological iron 

reduction can have a major impact on the persistence and mobility of toxic elements, 

radionuclides, and organic contaminants under such conditions (Lovley et al., 1993; 

Cummings et al., 1999; Zachara et al., 2001). Cummings et al. (1999) investigating the 

biological reduction of synthetic scorodite (FeAsO4 .2H2O), encountered that dissimilatory 

Fe reduction resulted in releasing of As(V) and Fe(II) into solution. Slower rate of 

reductive dissolution (chemical or microbiological) in the presence of Al substituting Fe in 

the iron (hydr)oxides structure was reported by Schwertmann (1984), Jeanroy et al. (1991), 

and reference therein. Torrent et al. (1987) observed that Al substitution depressed the 

reductive dissolution of synthetic goethite and hematite by dithionite/citrate/bicarbonate 

solution. Bousserrhine et al. (1999) also demonstrated that biological reduction of Al, Cr, 

Mn, and Co-substituted goethites was decreased as substitution increased. Al-goethite was 

more resistant to reductive dissolution than other substituted goethites. 

Abiotic processes are also thought to be related to the decoupling of Al or Fe 

(hydr)oxides-associated arsenic. Natural attenuation of arsenic by adsorption on these 

minerals may be also limited due to competing oxyanions, in which one anion will 

normally be competing for the sorption sites (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001; Sahai et al., 

2007; Zang et al., 2008). Due to similar acid dissociation constants phosphate (pKa1 = 2.1, 

pKa2 = 7.2, 
 pKa3 = 12.3) behaves much like arsenate (pKa1 = 2.2, pKa2 = 6.9, 

 pKa3 = 11.4). 

In addition to phosphate, carbonate may also, to a lesser extent, limit the arsenate sorption 

reactions. The displacement of adsorbed As with dissolved carbonate was recently 

examined theoretically by Appelo et al. (2002), and this mechanism was proposed to be 

potentially one of the major reasons for high As concentrations in groundwater. Thus, it is 



 51

worthwhile to investigate the adsorption and replacement of one anion from mineral 

particles by another. In addition, investigations of the competition between the anions can 

provide insight into the reactions occurring on the surface (Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001). 

By associating the higher binding affinity of Fe (hydr)oxides for arsenic and the 

higher stability of Al under anoxic conditions can be an advantageous alternative for 

removing arsenic from water. Few studies have focused on As sorption processes onto or 

As release by reductive dissolution of Al-substituted Fe (hydr)oxides. Masue et al. (2007) 

reported a decrease in both coprecipitated As(III) and As(V) adsorption onto 

aluminium:iron hydroxides as the Al:Fe molar ratio increased. Furthermore, desorption of 

As by phosphate competing ion was favoured by the increase of Al:Fe ratio. In view of 

these statement, the aim of this work was to investigate the decoupling of arsenate from Al-

substituted goethites and other synthetic Al and Fe (hydr)oxides influenced by dissimilatory 

iron reduction  and competing anions.

2.1. Synthesis of Al and Fe (Hydr)oxides 

Hematite (Hm), Goethite (Gt), and 2-line Ferrihydrite (Fh) were synthesised by 

neutralizing Fe(NO3)3 solution with KOH following the procedure outlined by 

Schwertmann and Cornell (2000). A series of aluminium substituted goethite with different 

Al:Fe ratios (15:50, 25:50, 35:50 v/v) was synthesised followed the methods therein. Al-

substituted goethites were synthesized from ferrous and aluminium chloride solutions by 

precipitation with potassium hydroxides and aged in a plastic bottle during 90 days. Slow 

oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and incorporation of Al in the goethite structure were achieved by 

opening the bottle daily and stirring the suspensions vigorously during 5 minutes. In order 

to remove the excess of Al, precipitates were washed twice with 0.01 mol L-1 KOH 

solution, several times with Milli-Q water, centrifuged, and dried at 50 oC at an oven with 

air circulation. To remove the excess of electrolyte, precipitates of Fe (hydr)oxides were 

also washed several times with Milli-Q water until achieving minimum electrical 

conductivity. Samples were then centrifuged and dried at 50 oC at an oven with air 

circulation, except for Ferrihydrite which was freeze-dried. 



 52

Gibbsite (Gb) was prepared following the procedures outlined in Kyle et al. (1975). 

An Al(NO3)3 solution was titrated with 4 mol L
-1 NaOH solution to a pH of 4.6 ± 0.2. The 

gelatinous precipitate was heated for two hours at 40 oC, then washed twice, dialyzed with 

Milli-Q water for 36 days and dried at 50 oC. The poorly crystalline aluminium hydroxide 

[Al(OH)3] was also prepared from an aluminium nitrate solution by precipitation with 4 

mol L-1 NaOH solution. The procedure was similar to that followed for the synthesis of 

gibbsite, but with the suppression of the heating step to preserve low crystallinity. Similarly 

to ferrihydrite, the aluminium hydroxide was freeze-dried in order to prevent its 

crystallization. 

The specific surface area was determined by multipoint BET analyses with N2 as 

adsorbent (Quantachrome model NOVA 1000). Particle size distribution was obtained from 

a laser analyser (Micromeritics Saturn Digisizer model 5200), respectively (Table 1). 

 

2.2. As(V) Loaded Adsorbents. One gram of the adsorbents were loaded with 

arsenate from a 10 mmol L-1 CaCl2 solution containing As(V) concentrations in a 250 mL 

polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Such concentrations were added to achieve the maximum 

adsorption capacity for each adsorbent, according to Silva et al. (2008). The pH was 

adjusted to 5.0 ±0.2 and the suspensions were equilibrated in a horizontal shaker during one 

week. The tubes were then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 30 min.), the supernatants filtered 

through 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, USA), and storage for As 
analyses. The remaining solid phases were freeze-dried and stored for further incubation 

experiments. The amount of As(V) adsorbed was calculated by the difference between the 

initial and final As concentration in supernatants (Table 1). Checks containing arsenic in 

solution but no adsorbent material were used to measure the amount of arsenic adsorbed by 

the walls of the reaction vessels. 

 

2.3. Bacterial Culture and Growth Medium. Cultures of Shawanella putrefaciens 

were obtained from Australian Collection of Microorganism at The University of 

Queensland. Bacteria were growth aerobically during 18 h to attain the log phase, and 

routinely cultured at 37 oC in sterile peptone yeast extract medium containing 10 g L-1 

peptone, 5 g L-1 yeast, and 5 g L-1 NaCl at pH 7.2.

The composition of the basal medium used for reduction experiment was: 20 mmol L-1 

NH4Cl; 1.34 mmol L
-1 KCl; 1.0 mmol L-1 CaCl2; 0.34 mmol L

-1 MgCl2; and 20 mmol L
-1 

sodium lactate as the solo electron donor. The medium was extensively purged with high-

purity N2 and autoclaved at 121 
oC during 20 min. 

 

2.4. Incubation Experiments. In order to investigate the influence of dissimilatory 

iron reduction and the presence of competing anion on arsenic release from different As-

loaded Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, a series of incubation experiments was carried out.  

 

2.4.1. Dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction. As-loaded adsorbents (0.2000 g) were 

equilibrated with 96 mL of the sterile basal medium and 4.0 mL of S. putrefaciens cell 

suspension in a 125 mL screw cap plastic bottle. The mixture was buffered at pH 7.0 by 

adding 10 mmol L-1 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES). Then, the suspensions 

were purged with high-purity N2 and anaerobically incubated in a glovebox for about 500 h. 

To investigate the possible influence of adsorbed arsenic in the bacterial activity, it was 

also carried out an assay with no As-loaded adsorbents. 

 



 54

2.4.2. Influence of competing anions. In order to investigate the effects of phosphate 

and carbonate on arsenic release under anaerobic conditions, two parallel experiments were 

carried out. Both were performed at the same conditions of the preceding experiment 

(section 2.4.1), with As-loaded adsorbents in the presence of S putrefaciens. The only 

difference was the addition of 5.0 mmol L-1 of phosphate (as KH2PO4) or 30 mmol L
-1 of 

carbonate (as NaHCO3) in the basal medium, as competing anions. In the latter experiment 

NaHCO3 substituted the PIPES solution as pH buffer, lactate was supplied at 10 mmol L
-1, 

and As-loaded adsorbents at 1.0 g L-1.  

For all experiments checks were also carried out with no cell suspension. Aliquots 

were periodically taken, filtered through 0.22 ?m membrane filters (Millipore Millex-GV, 
USA), acidified and stored for further analyses of Al, As, Fe, and P. The total volume of the 

aliquots did not exceed 10 % of the initial volume. 

All chemical used were reagent grade and water was purified through a Milli-Q 

system. All cell additions, transferring, and culture samplings were performed with sterile 

syringe or pipette tips previously flushed with high-purity N2. All assays were carried out in 

triplicates. 

 

2.5. Analytical Techniques. Soluble Al, As, Fe, and P contents in the aliquots were 

measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using a 

Perkin Elmer Optima 3300 DV. Scandium was used as internal standard to correct for 

instrumental instabilities and matrix effect. Solution of this element was added to the 

aliquots to reach a final concentration of 44.5 µmol L-1. Typical detection limits (3?) of 0.42 
µmol L-1 were obtained for As.  

 

 

3. Results and Discussion.  

3.1. Reduction of Fe(III) and Arsenic release. Contents of Al, As and Fe in solution 

were negligible in the control experiments, suggesting no As release due to Fe reduction at 

the absence of bacterial cell suspensions (data not shown). Initial low concentrations of Al 

(0.05 mmol L-1 and 0.075 mmol L-1 for gibbsite and poorly crystalline aluminium 

hydroxide, respectively) and As (&amp;lt;1,6 ?mol L-1, for all of adsorbents) were ascribed to 



 55

dissolution-desorption equilibrium during the time period to set up the experiment (ca. 12 

h). This result may be due to the relative high ionic strength (I=0.0252) of the basal 

medium, increasing the likelihood of the anion exchange. Thus, those initial concentrations 

were subtracted from further data to express solely effects associated to dissimilatory 

reduction. 

Increases in soluble Fe was interpreted as dissimilatory reduction occurred for Fe(III) 

(hydr)oxides, indicating that they were able to support bacterial growth as electron 

acceptor, independent of the crystallinity or Al-substitution (Figure 1). All Fe(III) 

(hydr)oxides were partially reduced by bacteria, but the iron reduction rates were decreased 

for the As-loaded adsorbents (Figure 1b) in relation to no As-loaded ones (Figure 1a). For 

instance, higher percentages of reduced iron were obtained for AlGt13, AlGt20, and AlGt23 

without adsorbed arsenic which achieved respectively 12.8, 11.5, and 11.30 % in 

comparison with 8.1, 7.3, and 7.2 % observed in the presence of adsorbed arsenic. 

Additionally, Fe(II) production started earlier (&amp;lt;48 h) in the absence of adsorbed As and 

just after 96 h of incubation time in its presence. These results indicate that adsorbed As not 

only delays, but also constrains the bacterial activity. The effect of arsenic on the bacterial 

activity can be better observed by the clear difference in iron reduction pattern for Fh 

(Figure 1a, and b). We evoked two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) the toxicity of As 

per se to the bacterial cells; and (2) electrostatic repulsion between As-loaded (hydr)oxides 

and bacterial cells. The second hypothesis consider that S. putrefaciens cells present 

negative net charge at pH ? 4 (Claessens et al., 2004) and then they could easily attach to 
the positive surface of the iron (hydr)oxides at the conditions of this investigation (pH ? 
7.0), as the point of zero charge (pHPZC) is about 8-8.5 for most (hydr)oxides. Nevertheless, 

it is well known that specific adsorption of anions, e.g. phosphate or arsenate, modifies the 

mineral surfaces decreasing the pHPZC up to four pH units (Arai and Sparks, 2001). Thus, 

by decreasing the pHPZC adsorbed As would promote increases in the negative charge on 

the iron (hydr)oxide surfaces leading to electrostatic repulsion between bacterial cells and 

Fe(III) colloids.

 57

The presence of aluminium in the goethite structure limited the iron reduction rate, 

thereby, the Fe(II) concentrations were smaller as structural Al increased. This finding is in 

line with previous results (Schwertmann, 1984; Jeanroy et al., 1991; Boussarine et al., 

1999), but diverges from data reported by Boussarine et al. (1999) concerning to Al 

solubilisation. According to these authors Al dissolution was congruent with Fe reduction 

from Al-substituted goethites which was not observed during the course of our experiment 

(data not shown). Such difference can be ascribed to distinct experimental conditions. The 

acidic medium (pH = 3.4) obviously conditioned Al solubilisation in the experiment 

performed by Boussarine et al. (1999). Under our experimental condition (pH ? 7.0) the 
Al3+ activity is rather low and Al(OH)3

°
 is expected to be the dominating soluble species, 

according to Lindsay (1979). Anyway, surface passivation can be ascribed to Al 

precipitates on the Al-goethite surfaces restraining its reductive dissolution as argued by 

Kakkudapu et al. (2001).  

As a general observation it can be considered two different patterns for arsenic 

mobilisation: first, mobilisation of arsenic from well crystallized iron (hydr)oxides (Gt and 

Hm) was delayed in relation to Fe reduction (Figure 1c, and d). Second, a congruent release 

of As with Fe reduction from poorly crystallised Fh, and Al-substituted goethites (Figure 

1e, f, g, and h). Such results suggest preferential mobilisation of Fe not associated with 

adsorbed As at the initial stages of the reductive dissolution of well crystallised Hm and Gt. 

On the other hand, iron dissolution from poorly crystallised Fh gave rise to a prompt As 

mobilisation which increased up to approximately 100 ?mol L-1 during roughly 400 h of 
incubation time (Figure 1e). The amounts of arsenic mobilised from Al-substituted 

goethites were much lower than for Fh and decreased as the structural Al increased (Figure 

1f, g, and h). This behaviour concurs and perhaps is associated with higher specific surface 

area and As adsorption capacity for Fh in relation to Hm and Gt (Table 1). Concerning to 

these aspects, Al-substituted goethites exhibited an intermediate behaviour between well 

and poorly crystalline Fe (hydr)oxides.  

Although goethite and hematite had shown the lowest final concentrations of soluble 

arsenic, roughly 5 and 10 ?mol L-1, respectively, an opposite trend is depicted when the 
data are expressed as percentage of the initial content of Fe(III) and As in the solid phase. 

By considering the Asmobilised/Astotal ratio as a function of Fereleased or Asmobilised/Astotal ratio 



 58

as a function of Fereleased/Fetotal ratio (Figure 2a, and b), it can be observed that the lowest 

percentage of both Fe dissolution and arsenic mobilisation for AlGt23, followed by AlGt20. 

Hematite, Goethite, and AlGt13 presented values quite similar, whilst Fh remained with the 

highest amount of iron and arsenic released, almost 20 % and 5 %, respectively. These 

results reflect that aluminium markedly enhanced the stability of the goethites face to 

dissimilatory iron reducing.  

The expected relationship between surface area and Fe dissolution or arsenic 

mobilisation was not observed. When normalised to specific surface area, comparable 

fractions of Fereleased/Fetotal were observed for Gt, Hm, and AlGt13 (Figure 2c). Increment of 

structural aluminium reflected in lower fraction of reduced Fe, even though, Al-goethites 

present similar surface area. Thus, the difference in Fe solubilisation should be attributed to 

variations in crystal properties due to Al substitution, other than specific surface area. 

Additionally, as the direct contact between bacteria and (hydr)oxides surfaces is considered 

a rate determining step for iron reduction (Liu et al. 2001), the presence of Al sites on the 

crystal surfaces could have inhibited the electron shuttle between Al-goethite surfaces and 

cell membranes. This is based on fact that bacteria probably are not able to distinguish 

active Al or Fe charge sites, binding on either. Then, the likelihood of bacterial membrane 

to be bound with Al sites instated of Fe ones should be higher as structural Al increases. 

The fraction of dissolved arsenic as a function of specific surface area mirrored the 

behaviour for iron, except to Al-substituted goethites (Figure 2c). Difference in the 

fractions of dissolved arsenic from Al-goethites was not observed, suggesting that 

mobilised arsenic could to a certain extent be readsorbed by Al reactive sites on the Al-

goethite surfaces. This hypothesis is in line with the findings of Mello et al. (2006). These 

authors suggested that arsenic mobilised by reductive dissolution of iron (hydr)oxides may 

be readsorbed by gibbsite in As-rich soils submitted to anaerobic incubation.

3.2. Influence of phosphate as competing anion. Dynamics of P under anaerobic 

conditions, at pH 7 ±0.2 and 37 oC, shows that phosphate readily displaced arsenate and 
promptly reacted with other ions in solution and solid matrixes (Figure 3). In general, more 

than 20 % of the added phosphate was immobilised after 4 h (first measurement) as a result 

of adsorption or precipitation equilibria. In fact, theoretical calculations support our 

statements, indicating formation of metastable phases. By running our data in the Visual 

Minteq® software (ver. 2.5), it was predicted saturation with respect to calcium phosphate 
phases, primarily hydroxyapatite. In addition, phosphate adsorption followed  by  As(V)

desorption can also be considered. By comparing these results with the data from the 

preceding section, it can be seem that As was early released here, at the start of the 

experiment. This initial release of As can be ascribed to exchange by competing phosphate 

equilibrium, as no Fe reduction is expected at the beginning of the experiment.  

It is worth of note that initial P immobilisation was higher, almost 30 %, in the 

suspensions containing poorly crystalline (hydr)oxides [Fh and Al(OH)3] and Al-

substituted goethites. Taking into account that all adsorbents were submitted to similar 

experimental conditions, i.e. equal concentrations of Ca and P added to the medium, P 

immobilisation due to Ca-P precipitation should rigorously be the same for all adsorbents. 

Then, additional amount of P immobilised for Fh, Al(OH)3, and AlGts in relation to well 

crystalline (hydr)oxides can be ascribed to P adsorption. It should also be considered that 

arsenic was loaded at near maximum adsorption capacity and that P was supplied at 

concentrations (5 mmol L-1) sufficient to ensure a large excess with respect to total 

adsorbed arsenic. Anyway, amounts of desorbed As does not explain the excess of P 

immobilised in suspensions of poorly crystalline (hydr)oxides in relation to well crystalline 

ones. Therefore, it should be considered P adsorption at additional sites not occupied by 

As(V). In fact, previous investigations have shown that surface coverage in the competitive 

adsorption experiments is higher than the adsorption of the individual ions (Hongshao and 

Stanforth, 2001; Zhang and Selim, 2008) suggesting that there are some specific sites for 

each ion as well as other sites that can adsorb both ions (Manning and Goldberg, 1996b). 

Later, after 12 h (second measurement), the fraction of phosphate immobilised 

decreased to achieve a steady-state by 144 h for those adsorbents to which no significant 

iron release was observed, i.e. hematite, goethite, gibbsite, and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3. 

This indicates remobilisation of phosphate probably from those metastable precipitated 

phases previously referred. The late steady-state equilibrium, however, was not observed 

for poorly crystalline Fh and Al-substituted goethites (Figure 3). On the contrary, there is a 

clear increase in the fraction of immobilised phosphate for these minerals after 144 h which 

in general coincides with a peak of soluble iron, notably for Fh. This suggests further 

precipitation of Fe(II)-P phases, as indicated by Visual Minteq® software. Theoretical equilibrium 
calculation revealed that vivianite [Fe(II)3(PO4)2 8H2O] precipitates at Fe(II) concentration 



 62

higher than 10-3 mmol L-1 in the presence of phosphate at 5 mmol L-1, under our experimental 

conditions. 

Formation of vivianite can also be responsible for the surprisingly low concentration 

of soluble iron under anaerobic conditions, as also addressed by Burnol et al. (2007). 

Concentrations of soluble iron, as a result of biological reduction of the iron (hydr)oxides, 

were much lower in the experiment with phosphate (Figure 3) in relation to the previous 

experiment (section 3.1). Even for well crystalline Hm and Gt, precipitation of vivianite can 

be argued to explain the differences between experiments. Concentrations of soluble iron 

were about 0.02 mmol L-1 for Hm and 0.07 mmol L-1 for Gt that corresponds to respectively 

140 and 40 times lesser than in the previous experiment, but still oversaturated with 

respected to vivianite. Alternatively, surface coverage of the adsorbents increased by P 

adsorption restricting the binding of (hydr)oxide surfaces on the S. putrefaciens cells can 

also be considered, as discussed earlier for arsenic.  

The pattern of P immobilisation in the treatments without arsenate (Figure 4) was 

similar, but generally greater than in the treatments with loaded arsenic adsorbents. 

Differences should be attributed to higher adsorption of P at the absence of As(V). The 

greatest difference was verified to poorly crystalline Al hydroxides where P immobilisation 

increased from roughly 30 % in the presence of As(V) to almost 80 % in the absence of 

As(V). For Fh the initial difference was from nearly 30 to 50 %, and lower to AlGts 

followed by well crystalline Gb, Gt, and Hm, roughly corresponding to the amount of 

available adsorption sites, as measured by specific surface area or maximum As adsorption 

capacity. 

Similar arsenic desorption trends were observed for all materials. The fraction of 

desorbed arsenic decreased in the following order: Gb ? AlGts &gt; Gt &gt; Hm &gt; Fh &gt; Al(OH)3. 

The arsenic release initiated readily after the addition of phosphate (?4 h), increasing 
quickly up to 48 h and trended to slowed down thereafter (Figure 3). For example, nearly 

70 % of the total of As solubilised from goethite was reached by 48 h. Considering that 

soluble iron was not detected during the initial interval (4 – 48 h), the arsenic displacement 

may be exclusively attributed to ligand exchange reactions with phosphate. Expressive 

amounts of As were released from gibbsite and Al-substituted goethites, in general more than 

50 % within the time frame. This should integrally be attributed to exchange by phosphate 



 63

on Gb surface, but for AlGts part of the released amount must be attributed to biological 

iron reduction. Al-substituted goethites followed similar kinetics, and the fraction of 

mobilised arsenic was higher as the structural Al increased (Figure 3, AlGt13, AlGt20, and 

AlGt23). Such weak retention of arsenic on the Al sites, except for poorly crystalline 

Al(OH)3, suggest formation of unstable surface complex related to surface precipitation of 

arsenic on these adsorbents. Notwithstanding, spectroscopic investigation is warranted to 

further elucidate the type of surface complexes formed between As and these matrixes. 

Although less impressive, our data are in line with Masue et al. (2007) that reported 

increasingly As(V) desorption by phosphate from poorly crystalline Al-Fe hydroxides as 

the Al:Fe ratio increased, reaching to almost total arsenate desorption from pure Al 

hydroxide after 24 h. That difference can be ascribed to the much higher P:As (7500:1) 

ratio used by those authors. 

The relatively low amounts of As desorbed by phosphate from crystalline iron 

(hydr)oxides that we observed agree with results from Hongshao and Stanforth (2001), and 

suggest that arsenate is adsorbed mainly as nonexchangeable ion, but there were a minor 

fraction exchangeable by phosphate. In fact, As(V) or P adsorption kinetics are considered 

a two-phase reaction, with a rapid initial step followed by a much slower reaction (Torrent 

et al., 1992; Hongshao and Stanforth, 2001). According to Hongshao and Stanforth (2001), 

the nonexchangeable fraction comprises the amount of ions initially adsorbed in the first 

step, and the exchangeable fraction corresponds to a surface precipitation on the adsorbed 

layer. Additionally, there is a fraction of the surface sites that are very rapidly occupied but 

which are not exchangeable once occupied. Phosphate and arsenate are adsorbed equally at 

low surface coverages, but arsenate forms a less soluble precipitate than does phosphate. 

Therefore, phosphate adsorption does not achieve the same surface coverage when added 

after arsenate.  

The fraction of arsenic desorbed from Fh and Hm were quite similar, close to 26 %, 

but it reached almost 37 % from Gt. Nevertheless, it seems that exchange reactions not 

ceased after 456 h for Hm (Figure 3). A distinct behaviour was observed for Fh where the 

amount of arsenic released reached its maximum about 192 h and suddenly dropped off to 

almost zero. This depletion of soluble arsenic coincided to P immobilisation due to 

vivianite precipitation, as stated earlier. However, unlike P, As immobilisation can not be 



 64

ascribed to an Fe(II)-As phase precipitation, as indicated by theoretical calculation. But, as 

phosphate behaves much like arsenate, it can be argued to As co-precipitation with 

vivianite. This hypothesis is feasible considering the structure of As(V) and P minerals, 

where typical tetrahedral anions [XO4]
3- are bound to octahedrally coordinated transition 

metal ions. Variations and multiples of this bonding pattern tend to create relatively open 

structures that allow for extensive substitution of cations, anions, anions groups, and water 

(O’Day, 2006). Consequently, the precipitation of Fe(II)-P phases could act as sink for 

arsenic giving rise to a vivianite-like mineral {Fe(II)3[(As, P)O4]2.8H2O}. This observation 

has a great environmental implication to the fate of As in eutrophic-reducing aquatic 

systems.  

Aluminium hydroxide was by far the most efficient in retaining arsenic on its surface. 

Less than 15 % of the Astotal were desorbed by phosphate. Arsenate adsorption kinetic data 

for Al(OH)3 revealed that more than 92 % of the added arsenate was adsorbed in nearly 6 h 

(Silva et al., 2008). In addition, nearly 66 % of phosphate added to poorly crystalline 

Al(OH)3 suspension was sorbed in 4 h (Figure 4), that corresponds to nearly 80 % of total P 

immobilised after 456 h. Phosphate adsorbed later (20%) is comparable to the fraction of 

As desorbed by competing P (15 %). Thus, considering that adsorption kinetic is related to 

exchangeability of P and As ions, as pointed out earlier, our data indicate comparable 

amounts of specific sites for adsorption of P and As in the initial phase. Then, it may be 

inferred that the majority of As is adsorbed on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 surface as a 

nonexchangeable phase, strongly attached and likely forming a very stable surface 

complex. 

 

3.3. Influence of carbonate as competing anion. Desorption of arsenic by carbonate 

from Al and Fe (hydr)oxides, under dissimilatory iron reduction (Figure 5a), was in general 

inferior to that desorbed by phosphate (Figure 3). This indicates, a lower competitive effect 

for adsorption of carbonate on those surfaces, in relation to arsenate or phosphate, as 

previously reported (Ghosh et al., 2005; Radu et al., 2005; Burnol et al., 2007). Radu et al. 

(2007) observed that carbonate mobilised less adsorbed As(V) than was mobilized by 

phosphate, even when present in much higher concentrations than phosphate. Exceptions 

for Gb, Fh, and Gt can be ascribed to a weak surface binding mechanism of As(V) in Gb  or

to a mobilisation of As due to reductive iron dissolution in Fh and Gt, as will be discussed 

later.The fraction of arsenic desorbed by carbonate from Al-substituted goethites was 

almost the same in the presence (Figure 5a) and absence (Figure 5b) of iron reducing 

bacteria. Gibbsite also presented comparable fractions of arsenic desorbed in both presence 

and absence of S. putrefaciens cells, being quite similar to that removed by phosphate. This 

result confirm that As(V) adsorption onto Gb surface characterises a binding mechanism 

weaker than to other (hydr)oxides. It is also clear that arsenic mobilisation from Gb and 

AlGts is primarily due to desorption by exchange with carbonate rather than to reductive 

dissolution, as the fraction of iron dissolved from these adsorbents (Figuere 5c) was quite 



 67

low (&amp;lt;2%). On the other hand, Fh, Gt, and in a lesser extent Hm presented higher arsenic 

release in the presence of bacteria in a such way that the differences can be ascribed to the 

reductive dissolution of iron. The highest difference was observed to Fh which presented 

less than 10 % of the adsorbed arsenic released in the absence of iron reducing bacteria. 

These results indicate that only 20 % of the arsenic release can be attributed to desorption 

by carbonate. For Gt, nearly 50 % of the arsenic release could be ascribed to that 

exchangeable mechanism. 

Soluble Fe and Al concentrations were negligible in the absence of bacteria. Only for 

Fh and Gt, there were appreciable fractions of iron dissolved in the presence of bacteria. 

Thermodynamics calculations indicated precipitation of siderite [Fe(II)CO3] at Fe(II) 

concentration higher than 0.01 mmol L-1, under our experimental conditions. Arsenic 

mobilisation from Gt and Fh under anaerobic conditions was congruent with biological iron 

reduction reaching nearly 60 and 50 %, respectively. These amounts of arsenic released by 

carbonate essay were superior to that observed to phosphate one. Although, theoretical 

calculations pointed out oversaturation with respect to siderite, unlike vivianite, apparently 

the metastable carbonate phases can not act as sink for soluble arsenic. 

There is much spectroscopic evidence that adsorbed As forms inner-sphere binuclear 

surface complexes with aluminium (Arai and Sparks, 2002; Goldberg and Johnson, 2001; 

Ladeira et al., 2001; Foster et al., 1998) and iron (hydr)oxides (Makris et al., 2007; 

Sherman and Randall, 2003; Fendorf et al., 1997; Grossl et al., 1997; Sun and Doner, 1996; 

Manceau et al., 1995). These stable complexes can account for the generally low desorption 

of arsenic by carbonate and phosphate. Notwithstanding, our data suggest that these 

complexes are to a certain extent more stable for poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and Fh 

followed by Hm in relation to goethite and gibbsite. 

 

 

4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION 

Our investigation presented insights related to arsenic mobilisation from Al-

substituted goethites and other synthetic Al and Fe (hydr)oxides under anoxic conditions 

influenced by microbiological activity as well as by competing anions. Differences in Fe 

and As dissolution as affected by the nature of the (hydr)oxides were observed. In the 



 68

absence of competing ion, arsenic mobilisation from Gb and poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 

was negligible, since aluminium does not participate as electron acceptor for bacterial cells. 

In contrast, S. putrefaciens cells were able to reduce iron from both noncrystalline and 

crystalline iron (hydr)oxides. For Al-substituted goethites we observed a decrease in the 

fraction of soluble iron and arsenic mobilisation as structural Al increased. Structural Al 

affected the expected relationship between specific surface area and iron dissolution 

preventing arsenic mobilisation. In relation to arsenic desorption by phosphate and 

carbonate in the presence of S. putrefaciens cells, iron dissolution and arsenic mobilisation 

varied according to the competing anion. Both phosphate and carbonate were able to desorb 

great amounts of arsenic from Gb, but the fraction of As displaced by phosphate from Al-

substituted goethites increased as structural Al increased. Then, we infer that the binding 

mechanism on the surface of these crystalline matrixes is governed to a certain extent by a 

weak binding complex. Poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was the most efficient in holding 

arsenate firmly on its surface followed by Fh and Hm. The poorly crystalline Al and Fe 

hydroxides proved to be most efficient phases in retaining arsenic, but aluminium 

hydroxide gains an advantage over Fh under reducing conditions. Arsenic released from 

poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was less than 8 % by carbonate
 in both presence and absence of 

iron reducing bacteria, and nearly 15 % by phosphate. Concerning to arsenic release under 

reducing condition, Fh showed to be more stable than poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 only in a 

later incubation time after 240 hours in the presence of phosphate as competing anion. 

Once soluble iron increased to a certain level, it combined with phosphate or carbonate 

giving rise to new metastable vivianite and siderite phases, as predicted by thermodynamics 

calculations. Apparently, vivianite can act as a sink for soluble arsenic limiting its 

mobilisation, but the same can not be assumed for siderite. Therefore, poorly crystalline 

Al(OH)3 can be considered the most effective adsorptive system to immobilise arsenic, 

because the presence of soluble carbonate is more common than phosphate in 

environmental conditions. 

Aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides are ubiquitous in the environment, and goethite is 

one of the thermodynamically most stable iron oxides (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). 

Thus, the presence of goethite with high structural Al may contribute to not only to 

improve the As(V) adsorption capacity of soils and sediments, but also to diminish its 



 69

mobilisation under reducing conditions. In contrast, intense use of phosphate fertiliser and 

liming or carbonate produced via microbial metabolism may add further complication to 

potential arsenic desorption from soils and sediments with high content of Gb, a common 

mineral in many soils.  

In water treatment, adsorptive process has been preferred due to its facility to handle 

the As-rich residues generated after adsorption process. Most investigations have suggested 

the use of hydrous ferric oxides to remove arsenic from drinking water due to their large 

surface area and consequently high efficiency. However, the disposal of the As-rich 

residues under reducing conditions, as might occur at a waste disposal sites (Masue et al., 

2007), is a very concerning issue with regards to the redox transformations of Fe(III) to 

Fe(II) mediated by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria leading to arsenic mobilisation. 

Hence, as Al is not redox sensitive, the use of a poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 can be 

considered a good option for removing arsenic from contaminated water, since under our 

experimental conditions it showed to be the most efficient in retain arsenic. The use of Al-

substituted goethites should also be taking into account as they presented high stability and 

As retention under anoxic conditions. Only in the presence of phosphate Al-substituted 

goethites were less effective than other iron (hydr)oxides, but environmental conditions 

presenting large P:As ratio as used herein is quite improbable. 

Nevertheless, prediction of arsenic mobility is a very complex issue, and As sorption 

modelling requires a more detailed comprehension of the bonding mechanism and kinetics. 

Thus, investigations are warranted to further elucidate the binding mechanisms that play a 

key role on arsenic sorption on Al-substituted goethites surfaces.

OUTLOOK AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

In this study, we assessed the efficiency of different Al and Fe (hydr)oxides in 

removing arsenate from contaminated water as well as the stability of the As-rich residues. 

Different adsorbents were spectroscopically characterised, revealing spectral changes due to 

presence of structural Al and arsenate sorbed phases. Poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 and 

ferrihydrite, presented higher arsenate adsorption efficiency, followed by Al-substitued 

goethites. The stability of the As-rich residue under reducing conditions was also higher to 

poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 e Al-substituted goethites. In the presence of competing anions, 

phosphate and carbonate, the adsorbed arsenate on poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 was stable, 

however, the same was not verified to Al-substituted goethites in the presence of 

phosphate. These results suggest the alternative use of Al to increase efficiency of water 

treatment methods. Use of poorly crystalline Al(OH)3 would represent advantage in relation 

to disposal of sludge from water treatment plants under reducing conditions as well as in 

phosphate-rich eutrophic environments and in the presence of dissolved carbonates. In this 

sense, Al-substituted goethites are also promising alternatives, except when the As-rich 

residue needs to be disposed in unusually phosphate enriched environments.
