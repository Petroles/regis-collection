agradecimentos 
 

Se algo aprendi ao longo destes cinco anos foi a admirar e a celebrar a 
diversidade que existe nesta língua que se espalhou pelo Atlântico e mais 
além. Desta e de tantas outras com que se cruzou... Que o futuro seja feito 
mais de encontros que de desencontros! Obrigado a todos e todas que 
contribuíram para essa descoberta! 
Fugindo aos protocolos agradeço, em primeiro lugar, a ti Ritinha! Se as teses 
pudessem ser escritas em co-autoria, o teu nome estaria na capa... Esta tese 
também é tua e, ao cabo de cinco anos de convivência, muito foi partilhado e, 
espero, muito haverá ainda para partilhar! 
Ao meu orientador, Prof. Doutor Carlos Fonseca, o meu obrigado pela 
solidariedade que sempre demonstrou ao longo deste meu percurso sinuoso. 
Obrigado também ao impulsionador desta epopeia, Prof. Doutor Amadeu 
Soares. Era uma vez uma reunião de laboratório no longínquo ano de 2005 e 
as voltas que a minha vida deu desde então! A ambos, muito obrigado pelo 
apoio, principalmente nos momentos mais difíceis. À Prof. Doutora Liliana 
Pena Naval, o meu muito obrigado pelo apoio e pela atenção devotados, e que 
foram além do que me atreveria a pedir! À minha co-orientadora, Prof. Doutora 
Adriana Malvasio, e a todos os “jovens” CROQUEs, o meu obrigado pelo 
companheirismo e boa disposição com que sempre fui recebido! Um obrigado 
também a todos os que na Naturatins, Parque Estadual do Cantão, Fazenda 
Santa Fé, Fazenda Lago Verde sempre providenciaram o apoio logístico 
necessário e se interessaram pelo desenvolvimento deste projecto. Agradeço 
também ao Instituto ECOTROPICAL (parceria Universidade de Aveiro e 
Instituto Ecológica) pelo apoio logístico. Ao Prof. Doutor Guarino Colli e ao 
grupo de herpetologia da UnB, o meu muito obrigado pelo carinho e pela 
atenção com que sempre fui recebido... poucas foram as oportunidades, mas 
sempre bastante  enriquecedoras e bem-dispostas. À Prof. Doutora Leonora 
Pires Costa e ao Prof. Doutor Yuri Leite, por me terem recebido na UFES 
durante o último ano e por me terem tratado como um “legítimo capixaba”, o 
meu muito obrigado! Ao Yuri, à Leo, à Carol, ao João, à Ju, ao André, à Ana 
Paula e a todos no LAMAB e no NGACB, com vocês do lado foi fácil enfrentar 
as maratonas de laboratório...e as cervejinhas de sexta à noite! Valeu pelas 
amizades que brotaram apesar do pouco tempo que aí passei! As amizades 
por vezes surgem das coisas mais simples, das conversas à mesa ou de uma 
cerveja depois de um dia a limpar mato e abrir buracos... Roberto, Sulene, Sr. 
António, Josi, Sr. Joaquim, Sr. Cimar, Sra. Maria, obrigado pelo apoio e pela 
camaradagem revelada na frente de batalha! Nuno, companheiro, ainda me 
lembro do dia 1 de Maio de 2006, em que cheguei a Palmas, de como chovia e 
de como nos recebeste em tua casa...e por lá fomos ficando mais de mês! 
Amigo, por tudo, o meu sincero obrigado! Aos amigos de longa data que 
ficaram por Aveiro, o meu obrigado por, mesmo após tantos anos de ausência, 
continuar a sentir-me acarinhado por todos! À minha família de emigração: 
Jacky, Susy, Chico, Beto, Sérgio, Andrea... agora há um pouco de mim 
espalhado por esse mundo fora, e um pouco de vocês onde eu estiver! Aos 
meus pais, Manuel e Amélia, e aos meus manos Carlos, Violeta e João, 
obrigado por estarem sempre presentes e por me apoiarem 
incondicionalmente...assim tudo se torna mais fácil! Sem vocês, não teria 
levado este barco a bom porto! Aos meus amigos da velha guarda... após 
tantos encontros e desencontros, parece que a nossa amizade veio para ficar! 
Um amigo é um porto de abrigo e um farol e revela-se em dias de tempestade!  
Aos meus “Amor e Meio”... Jaqueline e David... mi ê dod na bsot! Obrigado por 
terem tomado a minha vida de assalto e por não me deixarem baixar os 
braços. “O amor se planta e ganha força nas raízes” e, depois de tantas 
partidas e chegadas, será preciso mais do que três continentes e um oceano 
para nos separar. Este é o fruto da distância forçada...espero que não tenha 
sido em vão!

resumo 
 
 

A conservação da biodiversidade nunca foi uma assunto tão popular como nas 
últimas décadas, mas esta popularidade crescente é devida à pior das razões: 
o passo acelerado da extinção de espécies e habitats. Os ecossistemas 
tropicais são, ao mesmo tempo, os mais diversos e os mais ameaçados, em 
parte porque muitos países destas regiões emergem ainda de situações de 
instabilidade social, económica e política. O Brasil é o maior país Neotropical, 
onde se encontram alguns dos biomas com maior diversidade e mais 
ameaçados do planeta. Actualmente, é também um país líder ao nível da 
planificação e implementação de medidas de conservação da biodiversidade. 
Vários dos biomas tropicais mais diversos e ameaçados encontram-se em 
território brasileiro. Dois destes biomas, a Amazónia e o Cerrado, convergem 
numa região ecotonal sujeita a uma elevada pressão humana, conhecida como 
o arco do desmatamento. O Araguaia, um dos maiores rios do Brasil, corre ao 
longo desta paisagem e os efeitos do desmatamento são já evidentes em toda 
a sua bacia. Por causa do acelerado ritmo de degradação deste ecossistema, 
torna-se urgente obter uma imagem clara da biodiversidade regional e 
compreender como e se a estratégia de conservação para esta região é capaz 
de lidar com as correntes ameaças e alcançar o seu objectivo a longo prazo: 
conservar a biota regional. Tendo a herpetofauna como grupo-alvo, os nossos 
objectivos principais foram: aumentar o conhecimento das comunidades de 
anfíbios e répteis squamata da região do curso médio do Rio Araguaia; 
compreender a importância deste rio nos padrões intraespecíficos de estrutura 
e diversidade genética para diferentes espécies com diferentes características 
ecológicas; avaliar o potencial de diferentes metodologias para o estudo e 
monitorização da herpetofauna regional. Os nossos resultados revelam que a 
amostragem continuada e o uso de diferentes técnicas são essenciais para a 
obtenção de uma imagem precisa da diversidade da herpetofauna local. As 
comunidades locais de anfíbios e lagartos apresentaram maior riqueza 
específica na Área de Protecção Ambiental Bananal/Cantão (APABC), uma 
área tampão, do no Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC), uma área de 
conservação estrita. A APABC é caracterizada por uma maior heterogeneidade 
de habitats e os nosso resultados corroboram a teoria da heterogeneidade 
espacial e resultados recentes que revelam uma maior diversidade de lagartos 
nas zonas interfluviais do Cerrado, do que nas matas de galeria. Os resultados 
aqui apresentados não corroboram a hipótese de que os ecótonos apresentam 
maior diversidade do que os biomas em redor. Os nossos resultados 
revelaram ainda que o Rio Araguaia afecta de forma diferente a estrutura 
genética de várias espécies de anfíbios e lagartos. Estas diferenças poderão 
estar relacionadas com a ecologia das espécies, nomeadamente com o uso de 
diferentes habitats, a vagilidade, ou a estratégia alimentar. Sugerimos que a 
gestão integração de diferentes unidades de conservação, com diferentes 
estatutos, podem ajudar a preservar melhor a biota regional.

abstract 
 

Biodiversity conservation has never been such a popular matter as in the last 
decades, but this increasing popularity is due to the worst reason: the fast pace 
of extinction of species and habitats. Tropical ecosystems are both the most 
diverse and most threatened, in part because many countries from these 
regions are now emerging from decades of social, economic and political 
instability. Brazil is the largest country in the Neotropics and one of the world’s 
megadiverse countries. Nowadays, it is also a leading country in terms of 
planning and implementing biodiversity conservation measures. Brazil harbors 
several of the most diverse and threatened tropical biomes. Two of them, 
Amazonia and Cerrado, converge in an ecotonal region subjected to high 
human pressure, known as the deforestation arc. Araguaia, one of the largest 
Brazilian rivers, runs along this landscape and the effects of deforestation are 
already evident throughout its basin. Because of the fast pace of degradation in 
this ecosystem, it becomes urgent to get a clear picture of the regional 
biodiversity and understand how and if the conservation strategy for the region 
is able to cope with the current threats and accomplish its long-term objectives 
of preserving the regional biota. Having herpetofauna as the target group, our 
main goals are: to improve the knowledge on the amphibian and lizard 
assemblages in the region of the middle Araguaia River; to understand the 
intra-specific patterns of genetic structure and diversity for different species 
with different ecological features; to assess the potential of different 
methodologies for the study and monitoring of the regional herpetofauna. Our 
results revealed that continued sampling and the use of several techniques are 
essential to achieve an accurate picture of the diversity of the local 
herpetofauna. The local lizard and amphibian assemblages presented higher 
species richness in the Área de Protecção Ambiental do Bananal/Cantão 
(APABC), a buffer area, than in Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC), a strict 
conservation area. APABC is characterized by an higher habitat heterogeneity 
and our results corroborate the theory of spatial heterogeneity, as well as the 
conclusions of recent studies that reveal a higher diversity of lizards in the 
interfluvial áreas of Cerrado, than in gallery forest. The results here presented 
do not corroborate the hypothesis that ecotones present greater diversity than 
the surrounding areas. Our results also reveal that River Araguaia differently 
affects the genetic structure of several species of amphibians and lizards. 
These differences might be related with species ecology, namely with the use 
of different habitats, vagility or feeding strategy. We suggest that integrated 
management of different conservation units, with different conservation 
statuses might help to better preserve the regional biota.

1.1 – Introduction 

One of the major obstacles to the conservation of the biodiversity, at the global 

scale, is that we live in a world in use. The destiny of millions of species is dependent on 

the will of a species, with thousands of millions, which inhabits the planet and uses its 

resources, but not like all the other species. This species, Homo sapiens, does not adapt 
itself to the environment; it adapts the environment to its needs, at a level without known 

parallel in the history of the planet. 

Recent hypotheses about human dispersal place the Americas as the last region 

to be colonized by humans (Fagundes et al., 2007, 2008; Mulligan et al., 2008). Even 

though, this continent was colonized long before the modern paradigm of land-use and of 

the concept of natural world as a source of commodities. Contrarily to earlier believe, the 

peoples inhabiting Amazonia before European contact were also familiarized with plant 

domestication. However, the use and management of useful plants was not based on 

forest clearing and crop plantation, but on “landscape domestication” (Clement, 2006; 

Junqueira et al., 2010). In Cerrado, archeological evidences suggest that hunter-gatherer 

peoples were the first to colonize the biome, and were dependent on native plant and 

game species (Klink and Moreira, 2006). Common to both approaches was the 

sustainability of the coexistence between human populations and its environment. 

At the present state of development, it is naïve to believe that such coexistence is 

still possible, or even desirable for the majority of human populations. Modern societies 

are dependent on domesticated plants and animals for almost everything and generally 

ignore the importance of wild species and habitats for the survival of peripheral human 

communities (Redford and Robinson, 1991a). The success of conservation efforts will 

depend on understanding and conciliating the needs of people living at the edge of these 

pristine areas with the need to preserve biodiversity (Fragoso et al., 2004; Schmink, 2004; 

Rudel, 2005). Meanwhile, biodiversity is being lost, sometimes even before being 

discovered (Fouquet et al., 2007). Species and ecosystems are not equally vulnerable and 

some adapt themselves to a rapidly changing world; others do not. 

 

 

1.2 – Two Biomes: Amazonia and Cerrado 
Forests used to be seen as pristine landscapes, while grasslands were traditionally 

considered as a transitional state in the succession to an equilibrium forest state (Bond 

and Parr, 2010). However, according to these authors, the tropical and subtropical long-

Cerrado (brown) biomes, and Brazilian federal units: MT – sate of Mato Grosso; PA – state of Pará; 

TO – state of Tocantins. Major Brazilian rivers are also depicted. 

 

standing grasslands are better explained in a framework of alternative ecosystem states. 

The main difference might be related with differences regarding shade tolerance, with 

shade-intolerant species dominating savannas and shade-tolerant species abounding in 

forests (Bond and Parr, 2010). A forest-dominated ecosystem, Amazonia, and a 

grassland/savanna-dominated ecosystem, Cerrado, merge along an ecotonal region that 

extends throughout several thousand kilometers, in central Brazil (Figure 1.1). In addition, 

several large savanna patches occur within the Hylean forests (Ratter et al., 2006), while 



 
 
 

General Introduction and Objectives

gallery forests extend the Amazon influence along the watercourses in Cerrado (Oliveira-

Filho and Ratter, 2002). In fact, a large portion of Cerrado biome is located within the 

limits of the legally defined Amazonia (Ratter et al., 2006). 

Amazonian rainforest is the world’s largest major wilderness area (Mittermeier et 

al., 1998) and about two thirds of this biome are located within the Brazilian borders (Silva 

et al., 2005). Amazonia is far from being a uniform tract of forest; rather it encompasses a 

wide variety of landforms such as the Andean foothills, the tepuis in the north, the 
várzeas, terra firme and igapó forests (Rudel, 2005). Different areas of endemism for 
terrestrial vertebrates, separated by the major Amazonian rivers, were recognized within 

the biome, of which Tapajós, Xingú, Belém and Roraima areas of endemism are 

exclusively or almost exclusively within Brazil (Silva et al., 2005). The climate varies along 

the Amazonian biome, with a marked seasonality in rainfall in the eastern regions that is 

absent in the western ones (Rudel, 2005). Amazonian habitats are largely dominated by 

trees and lianas (Ribeiro et al., 1994; Ivanauskas et al., 2004). Exception is made to the 

savanna enclaves that present higher proportions of grasses and shrubs, similarly to the 

open formations of the Cerrado biome (Ratter et al., 1997; Filgueiras, 2007). These 

enclaves of Amazonian savanna are however much less diverse than the core of Cerrado 

(Ratter et al., 2003), which is also true for faunal communities (Gainsbury and Colli, 2003). 

The natural or anthropogenic origin of Cerrado has been a matter of debate 

(Ledru, 2002). There are strong evidences of a worldwide expansion of tropical and 

subtropical grasslands and savannas dominated by C4 grasses (such as Cerrado), 

starting around 8 million years ago, after a global decrease of atmospheric CO2 (Cerling et 

al., 1997; Mayle et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2009; Bond and Parr, 2010). On the other hand, 

palynological records suggest that the earliest record of cerrado-type vegetation in Brazil 

dates back to 32,000 years before present, in the Central Brazilian Plateau (Ledru, 2002). 

Even though, according to this author, the fire-adapted vegetation of Cerrado probably 

existed before people arrived to South America. In either way, Cerrado is considered a 

global biodiversity hotspot for plants and vertebrates (Mittermeier et al., 1998; Myers et al., 

2000). Species richness estimates for the Cerrado woody flora point to 950 to 1000 

species, but the biome is widely dominated by only a small fraction of this assemblage 

(Ratter et al., 2003; Bridgewater et al., 2004). A strong geographical pattern in the 

distribution of the flora was found in Cerrado, which allowed the recognition of several 

distinct floristic regions within this biome (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002; Ratter et al., 

2003). The Cerrado biome comprises several physiognomies ranging from grasslands 



 
 
 
Chapter 1

with or without trees (campo sujo or campo limpo, respectively), to gradually more 
forested areas (campo cerrado and cerrado sensu stricto) until almost closed woodland 
(cerradão) areas (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002). The previous physiognomies are 
present in dry areas but Cerrado also includes gallery forests along the watercourses, and 

seasonally flooded forests and grasslands (Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002).  

 

 

1.3 – Deforestation, Land Use and Conservation Areas 

Habitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of worldwide current biodiversity 

crisis (e.g., Skole and Tucker, 1993; Anderson and Jenkins, 2006), and the current main 

cause of habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical areas is deforestation. Recent studies 

showed that deforestation altered the patterns of species richness, diversity and 

abundance of the herpetofauna (Gardner et al., 2006; Bernarde and Macedo, 2008; Cano 

and Leynaud, 2010). On the other hand, some studies reveal that low-scale selective 

logging activities (Vallan et al., 2004) or silvicultural activities (Lopes, 2010) might present 

low impact on local herpetofauna. 

Total deforested area, and sometimes the deforestation rates, is higher in Cerrado 

than in Amazonia (Klink and Machado, 2005). Estimates of total deforested area in 

Cerrado vary between 39% (Sano et al., 2010) and 80% (Myers et al., 2000), depending 

on the criterion: only clear cutted areas; clear cutted and edge areas; or all areas under 

human influence, such as natural pastures. Considering the most optimistic estimative, if 

secondary growth forests and exploited native pastures are included as areas under direct 

human intervention, then the lower threshold rises to 53%, approaching the estimates 

provided by Klink and Machado (2005). In the year of 1988, estimates of effectively 

deforested area in Amazonia corresponded to 6% of the total area of the biome, but the 

area affected by deforestation was already about 15% (Skole and Tucker, 1993). 

Cumulative deforested area in Legal Amazonia, which includes areas covered by Cerrado, 

reached 17% in the year of 2006 and most of the deforestation was concentrated in the 

border between Amazonia and Cerrado (Reid and Sousa, 2005; Foley et al., 2007). This 

area is known as the Deforestation Arc (Figure 1.2), which extends along the eastern and 

southern borders of Amazonia, cutting through the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Pará, 

Mato Grosso, Rondônia, Acre and Amazonas (Vieira et al, 2008).

deforestation arc corresponds to the continuous deforested area (yellow and purple) extending 

from São Luís (state of Maranhão) to Rio Branco (state of Acre). Reproduced with permission 

from Girardi (2008). 

 

One of the reasons for the difference between the deforestation rates in the two 

biomes is that the Brazilian law (Klink and Machado, 2005). According to these authors, 

the latter requires that 80% of each holding in Amazonia should be preserved, but in 

Cerrado, this percentage is only 20%. In Cerrado, higher deforestation rates are reported 

for the southern states were only 13 to 32% of native areas still remain intact (Sano et al., 

2010). According to the same authors, Tocantins is the northern state with the greatest 

percent of deforested areas (21%). In Amazonia, deforestation rates also vary among the 

major endemism areas (Silva et al., 2005). The Xingu area of endemism, at the core of the 

deforestation arc (Figure 1.2), is the most severely affected area, with almost 27% of its 

native area already converted for human use (Silva et al., 2005). 



 
 
 
Chapter 1

The most frequently appointed causes for deforestation are extensive agriculture 

and cattle ranching (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Fearnside, 2005; Vieira et al., 2008). In a 

recent study in the Cerrado biome, Carvalho and collaborators (2009) concluded that 

croplands are more damaging than pasturelands for the conservation of biodiversity. The 

soils under Cerrado and Amazonia are relatively infertile (Klink and Moreira, 2002; 

Stepan, 2006) and, in a context of large-scale crop and cattle production, cleared areas 

soon become exhausted and new large areas must be cleared. Other related causes for 

deforestation have also been suggested, and Fearnside (2005) pointed the role of clearing 

in the establishment of land claims as one of the root problems. In addition, government 

loans and subsidies were primarily oriented to large-scale agriculture and logging 

activities, and allocated based on the size of planted area, encouraging extensive and 

inefficient agriculture practices (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Rudel, 2005; Clement, 2006). 

In this not very encouraging context, the great effort of Brazilian researchers, 

conservation professionals and governments in establishing a large and effective 

conservation program must be recognized (Rylands and Brandon, 2005). Brazil’s present 

system of protected areas includes strictly protected areas, such as parks, biological 

reserves and ecological stations; and sustainable use areas, which allow different types 

and levels of human use, and include national forests, environmental protection areas and 

extractive reserves, among others (Rylands and Brandon, 2005). According to these 

authors, in 2005, there were 478 federal and state strictly protected areas and 436 

sustainable-use areas, covering an area of about 37 million and 74.6 million hectares, 

respectively. Recent data from the Program of Amazonian Protected Areas (ARPA) reveal 

that 31 strict conservation areas and 30 conservation areas for sustainable use are 

presently included in this program, covering 32 million hectares of Amazonian forest 

(ARPA, 2011). 

As suggested by Peres (2004), the long-term persistence of the Amazonian biome 

depends on a large and integrated system of strict conservation and sustainable use 

areas. Unfortunately, in the Amazonian area of endemism of Xingu, for example, only 

0.29% is under strict protection and 2.72% are sustainable use areas (Silva et al., 2005). 

In the latter case, according to the authors, if indigenous areas are considered, 27.1% of 

this region is somehow preserved. The situation is not better in Cerrado, where only about 

2.2% of its total extent is under any legal conservation statuses (Klink &amp;amp; Machado, 2005). 

Conservation efforts could benefit from the integration of indigenous and smallholder 

communities, and some successful cases where reported, resulting in the conservation of

very large areas (Silvius, 2004; Campos and Nepstad, 2005). Large efforts for integrated 

protection of large extents of pristine areas are also being conducted by Brazilian 

conservation agencies, universities and international non-governmental organizations, by 

promoting the creation of ecological corridors. Some examples are: the “Corredor Jalapão 

– Oeste da Bahia”, in the transition between Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, in the border 

of the states of Tocantins, Piauí, Maranhão and Bahia; or the “Corredor Sul da Amazônia”, 

which includes all the forests located between the right margin of Madeira River and the 

central region of the state of Maranhão (CI-Brasil, 2011). 

 

 

1.4 – The Araguaia River Basin 
The Araguaia River (Figure 1.1) is the main fluvial system in Cerrado and, together 

with Tocantins River, constitutes the fourth largest drainage basin of South America 

(Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., 2009). The basin extends through both Amazonia 

and Cerrado biomes (Aquino et al., 2008). Araguaia presents an anabranching pattern 

that is characteristic of many large rivers (Latrubesse, 2008). Anabranching rivers consist 

of multiple channels separated by vegetated semi-permanent alluvial islands excised from 

preexisting floodplain or formed by within-channel or deltaic accretion (Nanson and 

Knighton, 1996). 

The Araguaia basin was recognized as a priority area for conservation (Azevedo-

Ramos and Galatti, 2002; Cavalcanti and Joly, 2002), and a plant diversity hotspot that, 

despite the outlying location, is mainly composed of typical Cerrado species (Oliveira-Filho 

and Ratter, 2002). The area is now the core of political, scientific and social debates, 

because of the intensive deforestation in Cerrado and the expansion of agribusiness in the 

region (Aquino et al., 2008). One of the controversial issues is related with the damming 

projects for Araguaia, which is one of the last undammed large rivers in Brazil (Reid and 

Sousa, 2005; Latrubesse et al., 2009). 

River damming can have direct impact on local fauna and habitats (Fearnside, 

2001; Brandão and Araújo, 2008). Dams can degrade socially valued riverine and riparian 

ecosystems, and the services they provide (Esselman and Opperman, 2010). As an 

example of direct impacts on fauna, dam-induced changes such as siltation of ponds, 

increased water velocities and lowered water temperatures were shown to be pottentially 

deleterious to turtle populations (Reese, 1996). Flooding of dam reservoir also may lead to 

depletion of amphibian species in local amphibian communities in the islands formed from 



 
 
 
Chapter 1 

10 
 

hill remnants, during the flooding of the reservoir (Brandão and Araújo, 2008). Habitat 

alteration caused by river damming was also shown to negatively affect native amphibian 

species, while promoting dominance by invasive species like Rana catesbeiana (Fuller et 
al, 2010). 

However, direct human intervention in Araguaia is just one of the matters of 

concern. There are evidences that deforestation in Cerrado is triggering erosion all over 

the basin of Araguaia and other Brazilian rivers (Coe et al., 2009; Latrubesse et al., 2009; 

Coe et al., 2011) and this erosion has been affecting mostly large arboreal vegetation in 

the floodplain (Latrubesse and Stevaux, 2006). The middle Araguaia extends for 1160Km 

and corresponds to 79% of its total drainage area (Aquino et al., 2008). The floodplains in 

the middle river course retain about 30% of Araguaia’s output during the flooding season, 

in part because of a complex lake system and because of the arboreal vegetation that 

slows down the flooding wave (Aquino et al., 2008). The question remains on how this 

dynamic is going to be affected by deforestation in the long term. Changes in land-cover 

are changing hydrology (Klink and Machado, 2005). The Araguaia basin still ensures the 

preservation of large Cerrado remnants (Latrubesse et al., 2009) but, in the long-term, this 

role might be compromised by the present deforestation rates. 

 

 

1.5 – The Herpetofauna 
Tropical regions present particularly rich amphibian and reptile faunas. Among 

amphibian taxa, the highest diversity of anurans and caecilians is found in the tropics, and 

only order Caudata is more diverse in temperate climates (Duellman, 1994; Wells, 2007). 

All reptilian taxa are represented in the tropics and some, such as crocodilians and 

several squamate families, are more diverse or even restricted to tropical and subtropical 

regions (Zug et al., 2001; Pough et al 2004). According to the Brazilian Society of 

Herpetology, there are currently 877 recognized species of amphibians (SBH, 2011a) and 

721 recognized species of reptiles (SBH, 2011b), known to occur in Brazil, with several 

new species being described each year. 

Several taxonomic rearrangements of squamate and amphibian taxa have been 

proposed in the last years, directly affecting the taxonomy of Neotropical taxa. The 

rearrangements included the establishment of new families, genera and species and the 

replacement and splitting of previously non-monophyletic taxa. Some examples are: 

Hylidae  (Faivovich et al., 2005); Amphibia (Frost et al., 2006); Dendrobatidae and close

11 
 

relatives (Grant et al., 2006); Gekkota (Gamble et al., 2007); Terrarana (Hedges et al., 

2008); or snakes (Adalsteinsson et al 2009; Zaher et al., 2009). 

 All the three groups of extant amphibians are present in Brazil, but anuran taxa 

are hegemonic in all biomes, both in the number of species, as in the number of families 

(Colli et al., 2002; Azevedo-Ramos &amp;amp; Gallati, 2002; Rodrigues, 2003; Avila-Pires et al., 

2007; Cruz and Feio, 2007; Strüssman et al., 2007). The order Gymnophiona is 

represented by two families – Caeciliidae (26 species) and Rhinatrematidae (one species) 

– and the plethodontid Bolitoglossa paraensis is the only representative of order Caudata 
(SBH, 2010a). On the other hand, anurans constitute more than 96% of all amphibian 

species in Brazil, distributed into 19 families. The most diverse family of anurans in Brazil 

is by far the family Hylidae, with 339 recognized species, followed by: Leptodactylidae 

(74), Cycloramphidae (68), Bufonidae (67) and Leiuperidae (55) (SBH, 2010a). The same 

pattern also occurs in Cerrado and Amazonia, where hylids and leptodactylids are the 

most numerous families (Colli et al., 2002; Bastos, 2007; Ávila-Pires et al, 2007) 

Most of world’s non-avian reptilian species are squamates (Pough et al., 2004) and 

the same occurs for Brazilian biomes (Colli et al 2002; Ávila-Pires et al 2007; Rodrigues, 

2003). Brazilian herpetofauna includes six crocodilian species, all from family 

Alligatoridae, and 36 chelonian species, distributed into eight families, including marine, 

terrestrial and fresh water representatives (SBH, 2010b). However, these two ancient taxa 

are outnumbered by squamates, which include 67 species of amphisbanids, 241 species 

of lizards and 371 species of snakes (SBH, 2010b). Autarchoglossa (133) is the most 

diverse lizard group, followed by Iguania (73) and Gekkota (34). At the family level, 

Gymnophtalmidae leads the ranking, with 82 valid species (SBH, 2010b). In Amazonia, 

this family also presents the highest number of species (Ávila-Pires, 2007), but the 

diversity of lizards in Cerrado is more evenly distributed, with Teiidae being the most 

speciose group (Colli et al., 2002).  

Higher species richness does not warrant a higher perceived importance. Despite 

amphibian and squamate species clearly outnumber chelonians and crocodilians, the 

latter two groups are more familiar to common people in South America. In fact, they are 

the economically most important reptile taxa in the Neotropics (Redford and Robinson, 

1991b; Vichers, 1991; Fachín-Teran et al., 2004; Seijas, 2004; Verdade and Piña, 2007). 

The same patern is verified locally, in the middle Araguaia basin, where turtles and their 

eggs are frequently consumed (Salera Jr., 2005; Salera Jr. et al., 2007; Ataídes 2009), as 

well as crocodilian meat, as reported by local people. 



 
 
 
Chapter 1 

12 
 

Large lizards, like iguanas or teiids, are important for some human communities in 

the Neotropics, as a protein source (meat and eggs) but also as a source of monetary 

income, because of skin trade (Fitzgerald et al., 1991; Werner, 1991; Fitzgerald et al. 

1994). Some anuran species are also used for human consumption (Pough et al., 2004), 

which is the case of the large Leptodactylus species, in the Araguaia basin. Toxins from 
frog skins are traditionally used in rituals or hunting by indigenous people in the Amazon 

basin (Myers et al., 1978, Daly et al., 1992). Presently, amphibian toxins are also being 

used in medical and pharmaceutical research (Shwartz et al., 2007). Moreover, 

amphibians, lizards and snakes are much appreciated in the international pet market 

(Schlaepfer et al., 2005; Wells, 2007). 

The first works about Cerrado herpetofauna (Duellman, 1979; Vanzolini, 1998; 

Sites, 1995) suggested its low differentiation, rate of endemism and lack of 

distinctiveness, but Colli and collaborators (2002) refuted these claims, stating that the 

horizontal habitat variability in Cerrado balanced the vertical variability typical of forested 

habitats, resulting in similar levels of local species richness. Recent studies reporting the 

highly habitat-structured nature of lizard assemblages in Cerrado supported this view 

(Nogueira et al., 2005; Costa et al., 2007; Nogueira et al., 2009). Some studies point to a 

greater diversity of anurans in the central and southeastern regions of Cerrado (Diniz-

Filho et al., 2006, 2007) but Bini and collaborators (2006) suggest that a more intense 

sampling in the northern areas of the biome would probably expand the distribution of 

known anuran species and eventually contribute with the description of new species. In 

the case of Amazonia, Avila-Pires (1995) and Azevedo-Ramos and Galatti (2002) 

suggested the existence of distinctive amphibian and lizard assemblages across the 

biome. Vitt and collaborators (1999) found that Amazonian herpetofauna was also 

structured relatively to microhabitat and diet. 

 

 

1.6 – The Riverine Barrier Hypothesis 

The herps from the mid-Araguaia basin live in a river-dominated landscape. 

Besides the Araguaia itself, two major tributaries are present in this area: Coco and 

Javaés. The idea that these rivers could play an important role in the evolutionary history 

of herps is easily born in mind. However, this idea is not new. The role of rivers as barriers 

to animal populations and, thus, as a mechanism responsible for the diversification of the 

Amazonian fauna, was first formally proposed as the “Riverine Barrier Hypothesis”, in 



 
 
 

General Introduction and Objectives 

13 
 

1852, by Alfred Russell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). The idea that rivers could have shaped 

Amazonian biodiversity resulted from the observation that: (1) large rivers are common in 

the Neotropics since the Pleistocene; (2) they dissect the tropical forest in fragments of 

various sizes (Gascon et al., 1998); (3) and different species occurred in opposite banks 

of the same river. Several alternative hypotheses for the diversification of Amazonian 

diversity were proposed since then and reviews on this subject are available (Haffer, 

1997; Moritz et al., 2000; Zeisset &amp;amp; Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). 

Some authors elaborated predictions that should be proven true, in the case of 

river-mediated diversification (Haffer, 1997; Moritz et al, 2000; Patton et al., 2000). For 

example, Patton et al (2000) suggested three possible scenarios of river mediated 

divergence: (1) reciprocally monophyletic and sister clades on opposite sides of the river 

would indicate primary diversification; (2) reciprocally monophyletic but not sister clades 

on opposite sides of the river would suggest secondary contact; (3) paraphyletic 

relationship from one bank relatively to the other would correspond to an event of 

dispersal across the river. 

Patterns of species distribution or the phylogenetic patterns of vertebrate species 

sometimes appeared to fit the predictions of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. Some 

examples are: the distribution patterns of amphibians and other vertebrate groups in 

lowland Amazonia (Ron, 2000); and the phylogenetic patterns of amphibians (Noonan and 

Wray, 2006; Funk et al, 2007), lizards (Pellegrino et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Robles et al., 

2008), birds (Bates et al., 2004), tamarins and rodents (Patton et al, 2000). However, 

several other (or even the same) studies reveal examples of distribution and phylogenetic 

patterns that contradict the predictions of this hypothesis (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed 

et al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; Patton et al., 2000; Symula et al., 2003). Several authors 

agree that no single model could adequately explain Amazonian diversity, and that 

different mechanisms should be relevant in speciation processes of different faunal groups 

(Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). 

Alternative hypothesis for the origin of the Neotropical diversity have been tested in 

the last years. For example, the hypothesis of the Pleistocene refuge received support 

from the study by Carnaval and Moritz (2008), who found that paleoclimate modelling 

predicted the presence of historical refugia that matched current centres of endemism and 

biodiversity patterns. On a different study, Carnaval et al. (2009) found that areas of 

historical stability within Atlantic Forest presented higher genetic diversity than populations 

from unstable areas, providing support for the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis. Some

support was also found for the role of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in shaping 

phlylogeographic pattern and historical demography of the Neotropical rattlesnake, 

Crotalus durissus (Wüster et al., 2005; Quijada-Mascareñas et al., 2007). However, 
evidence from Amazonian lizard and amphibian taxa showed that, in the studied cases, 

interspecific, and even intraspecific diversification occurred well before the Pleistocene, 

dismissing the Pleistocene refugia as the mechanism for Amazonian diversification (Glor, 

2001; Elmer et al. 2007; Gamble et al., 2008). There is also recent evidence contradicting 

the influence of historical refugia in the diversification of an Atlantic forest anuran (Thomé 

et al., 2010). An alternative hypothesis, the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis, received 

some support from the study of the phylogeographic patterns of the poison frog 

Dendrobates tinctorius (Noonan and Gaucher, 2006). Several authors agree that no single 
model could adequately explain Amazonian diversity, and that different mechanisms 

should be relevant in speciation processes of different faunal groups (Noonan and Wray, 

2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). 

 

 

1.7 – Thesis Objectives 

In face of the intensification of deforestation and agriculture pressure in Cerrado 

and Amazonia, most precisely in the deforestation arc and the transitional area between 

these two biomes, it becomes essential to have a clear picture of the regional biodiversity. 

There are plans for the establishment of a corridor of conservation areas in the middle 

Araguaia basin, involving several parks, sustainable use and indigenous areas, which also 

requires understanding how and if the conservation strategy for the region will be able to 

cope with the current threats and accomplish its long-term objectives of preserving the 

regional biodiversity.  

Having this in mind, and choosing herpetofauna as the target faunal group, our 

main objectives are: to improve the knowledge on the amphibian and lizard assemblages 

in the region of the middle Araguaia River, namely how these are distributed across 

different conservation areas with different conservation statuses; to understand the intra-

specific patterns of genetic structure and diversity for different species with different 

ecological features, within this region; and to to assess the potential of different 

methodologies for the study and monitoring of the regional herpetofauna. 

I begin this thesis by this general introduction (Chapter I) with the aim of providing 

a better picture of the region of the mid-Araguaia basin. I tried to cover different aspects 



 
 
 

General Introduction and Objectives

that I considered relevant in the context of this thesis: the two merging biomes; the 

economic and political context with focus on land use, current threats and conservation 

units; the characterization of the Araguaia hydrodynamics and the human impacts upon it; 

the characterization of the herpetofauna of Cerrado and Amazonia, within the Brazilian 

context, and finally the potential influence of rivers upon species diversification. Chapters 

II and III are presented with the objective of providing some information on the methods 

used during the collection of biological data. Fieldwork occupied more than two years of 

this study and is generally one of the most time-consuming tasks when studying 

biodiversity. We hope that the systematization of this kind of information might prove to be 

valuable for future researchers. Chapter IV focus on the distribution of amphibian and 

squamate species across the different conservation units, in an attempt to understand 

what is in fact being preserved and what is being left at the mercy of the fast-growing 

regional development. Chapters V and VI are focused on the role of the Araguaia on the 

diversification, respectively, of amphibian and lizard populations. In Chapter VII I try to 

summarize the main findings of the previous chapters and integrate them again in the 

larger context of the mid-Araguaia basin.

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna

2.1 – Abstract 

Small mammals and herpetofauna were surveyed in the Amazonia/Cerrado 

ecotone and the capture efficiency of live traps and pitfalls was compared. We also 

evaluated if these methods alone accurately estimated local species richness, by using 

additional methods. Sixty-seven small vertebrate species were captured. Larger pitfalls 

were significantly more efficient than smaller ones. We also found significant differences 

among live traps and between live traps and pitfalls, at the family level. Pitfalls were the 

less selective method and might reveal very useful even in short-term biodiversity surveys. 

Additional sampling methods substantially increased the number of captured species. We 

suggest that it is important to diversify capture methodology and that variation within taxa 

must be considered when designing sampling strategy, or biodiversity will be 

underestimated.

2.2. – Resumo 
A fauna de pequenos mamíferos e a herpetofauna do ecótono Amazônia/Cerrado 

foi amostrada e a eficiência de captura de armadilhas Sherman, Tomahawk e e 

armadilhas de queda foi comparada. Também avaliamos se estes métodos por si só 

estimariam de forma precisa a riqueza específica local, utilizando métodos adicionais. 

Sessenta e sete espécies de pequenos vertebrados foram capturadas. As armadilhas de 

queda maiores foram significativamente mais eficientes que as menores. Também 

encontramos diferenças significativas entre armadilhas Sherman, Tomahawk e 

armadilhas de queda, ao nível de família. As armadilhas de queda foram o método menos 

seletivo e podem revelar-se úteis mesmo em estudos de biodiversidade de curta duração. 

Os métodos de amostragem adicionais aumentaram substancialmente o número de 

espécies capturadas. Sugerimos que é importante diversificar a metodologia de captura e 

que a variação dentre taxa deve ser tida em conta durante o desenho da estratégia de 

amostragem, ou a biodiversidade será subestimada.

2.3 – Introduction 

Brazilian Cerrado is the only tropical savanna included in the twenty-five 

biodiversity hotspots proposed by Myers et al. (2000), and Amazonian Rainforest is 

considered the largest and most diverse major tropical wilderness area (Mittermeier et al. 

1998). These are the two largest Brazilian biomes (Klink &amp;amp; Machado 2005) and converge 

along a large ecotonal region in central Brazil, which is considered a conservation priority 

area (Azevedo-Ramos &amp;amp; Gallati 2002; Cavalcanti &amp;amp; Joli 2002). Despite its perceived 

importance, there is a generalized deficiency of sampling data in this area, common 

throughout the northern region of Cerrado (Marinho-Filho et al. 2002; Bini et al. 2006). 

Biodiversity surveys and complete species lists depend on efficient capture techniques. 

Careful evaluation of various techniques by experienced wildlife biologists is the key for 

successful capture programs (Schemnitz 1996). When available, published data about the 

efficiency of different methods could help to identify suitable techniques. Several studies 

about capture methodology were conducted in Amazonian Rainforest (Malcolm 1991; 

Voss &amp;amp; Emmons 1996; Woodman et al. 1996; Vieira 1998; Hice &amp;amp; Schmidly 2002; 

Lambert et al. 2005), but only a few exist for Cerrado, and only for the southern region of 

this biome (Cechin &amp;amp; Martins 2000; Vieira et al. 2004; Caceres et al. 2011). 

Several factors can influence capture success: incidence and amount of 

precipitation (Gibbons &amp;amp; Bennett 1974); closed versus mesh trap (O’Farrell et al. 1994); 
size of the trap and mass of captured individuals (Slade et al. 1993); trap-habit and trap-

avoidance (Sealander &amp;amp; James 1958); size of individuals and taxonomic group 

(Crosswhite et al. 1999) or ecological features across taxa (Malcolm 1991; Greenberg et 

al. 1994; Leite et al. 1996; Lambert et al. 2005). Generally, the simultaneous use of more 

than one method would help to increase the number of captured species (Mengak &amp;amp; Guyn 

1987; Greenberg et al. 1994; Voss &amp;amp; Emmons 1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999). 

Studies comparing different capture methods are normally developed within a 

particular region with a characteristic species assemblage. When extrapolating capture 

efficiency results from one area to another, wildlife professionals are confronted with 

different, but sometimes close, taxonomic assemblages. Therefore, comparisons made at 

higher taxonomical level, rather than species level, might be more useful. The aims of this 

study were: to survey small mammals and herpetofauna in the Amazonia/Cerrado 

ecotone; and to compare the capture efficiency of live traps (Sherman and Tomahawk 

traps) and pitfalls of two different sizes for different families of these vertebrate taxa.

Moreover, additional methods (active search and pipe traps) were also used to evaluate if 

live traps and pitfalls alone accurately estimate local species richness. 

 

 

2.4 – Methods 
 
2.4.1 – Study Area 

This study was conducted in two conservation areas in the western region of the 

state of Tocantins, Central Brazil: Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC) and the surrounding 

Área de Proteção Ambiental Bananal/Cantão (APABC). Fazenda Santa Fé (FSF) in the 

state of Pará – a nearby private ranch (65,000ha) without official conservation status – 

was also sampled. PEC (90,000ha) is a state natural reserve and APABC (1,700,000ha) 

is a conservation buffer area, where limited human activities (e.g. farming and forestry) 

are allowed. This buffer area surrounds PEC and the nearby Parque Nacional do 

Araguaia (PNA). A large river complex dominated by the Araguaia River, a natural border 

between the states of Tocantins and Pará, characterizes the area. The study area is 

located in the ecotonal region between the Cerrados from central Brazil and the 

Amazonian Rainforest, and is mainly composed of alluvial forests and, in a lesser extent, 

well-drained areas with more typical Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies (Oliveira-Filho &amp;amp; 
Ratter 2002). Seasonally flooded areas occupy most of PEC, and permanently dry areas 

are mostly located outside the park, in APABC and in the western margin of river 

Araguaia, state of Pará. Climate in this region of Brazil is tropical, with a rain season from 

October to April and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010). 

 

2.4.2 – Sampling 
Two trapping methods were used: pitfalls (approximately 30L – diameter 32cm/height 

38cm; and approximately 60L – diameter 38cm/height 54cm) with plastic drift fences 

(50cm height and 5m long) and live traps (Tomahawk – 45x21x21cm – and Sherman 

traps – 45x12.5x14.5cm). Four smaller sub-areas within the study area were sampled, 

each with five sampling points established at least 2 Km apart. Fourteen sampling points 

were established inside PEC and six in the surrounding areas. Sampling design at each 

point (Figure 2.1), consisted of: a line of sixteen 30L pitfalls with drift fences; a line of ten 

60L pitfalls with drift fences; a mixed line with 22 Sherman traps and 10 Tomahawk traps. 

Lines were placed at least 150m apart. Sampling design for pitfall lines was based on a 



 
 
 
Chapter 2 

32 
 

model proposed by A.P. Carmignotto (pers. comm.). Traps were checked daily, at early 

morning, to avoid desiccation of captured individuals. Water was added to pitfalls also to 

avoid desiccation, but without causing the drowning of small mammals, as reported earlier 

by Mengak &amp;amp; Guyn (1987). Excess water was removed after heavy rain. A small piece of 

wood or stone was placed inside the buckets to provide a dry surface for small mammals 

and lizards. Arthropods, mainly arachnids and ants, were removed from pitfalls, because 

they frequently preyed on vertebrates inside the buckets. Adding water also helped reduce 

vertebrate mortality caused by arthropods. Live traps were baited with peanut butter and 

pineapple and the bait was replaced every two days. At the end of each sampling period, 

buckets were closed, to prevent accidental death or injury of animals in the area, and live 

traps were removed. 

 
Figure 2.1 – Sampling design used in each one of the 20 sampling points. Lines of pitfalls and live 

traps were placed at least 150m apart 

 

Sampling was carried out between June 2007 and November 2008. Three 

sampling periods averaging seven nights (range 5–9 nights) were performed for each 

area: 1) at the end of the rain season (June to July 2007; May to June 2008); 2) during the 



 
 
 

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna 

33 
 

dry season (August to September 2007 and 2008); 3) at the beginning of the following rain 

season (October to November 2007 and 2008). Each sub area was sampled separately. 

Time intervals between consecutive samplings in the same area varied between one and 

a half and two months. We did not sample during the rain season since most of the area 

remains flooded. Small inconsistencies in trap-night numbers across methods were due to 

damaging of traps by wild animals or removal by local people. We also used active search 

and PVC pipe traps (tree pipe traps: 40cm long, adapted from Jonhson [2005]; lake pipe 

traps: 80cm long) as additional methods for surveying other species present in the area, 

but these methods were not used for statistical comparisons in this study. 

 

2.4.3 – Collecting and Marking 
All vertebrates captured in the traps (except snakes and some accidentally 

captured birds) were weighed with a digital scale (precision 0.1g) or with a spring scale 

(precision 20g), and identified to genus/species level, whenever possible. Individuals not 

identified in the field, as well as the first ones of each species caught, were collected as 

voucher specimens and deposited in “Coleção de Mamíferos da Universidade Federal do 

Espírito Santo” and “Coleção Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília” (CHUNB). All 

other individuals were individually marked and released. Small mammals were marked 

with ear-tags and amphibians and lizards were marked with visible implant elastomer 

(VIE). All procedures were performed according to Brazilian national laws and guidelines. 

Fieldwork was carried out with permits from the federal (ICMBIO, permits: 200/2006; 

036/2007; 13546-3 and 14307-1) and state (NATURATINS, permits: 019/2006; 009/2007 

and 001/2008) conservancy agencies. 

 

2.4.4 – Data Analysis 
Capture data from all sampling points and periods were pooled by type of trap (30L 

or 60L pitfall and Sherman or Tomahawk), family and species. Only first captures of each 

individual, in each method, were included in odds-ratio analysis and graphical weight 

analysis. If an individual was captured more than once by the same method, it was 

considered a recapture. Capture and recapture rates (expressed as percentages) were 

calculated as the ratio of capture and recapture numbers over total trap-night numbers. 

Captured individuals were classified by weight. Eight classes ranging from 0 to 

2187g were defined according to a geometric series with base 3: [0–30:36–37]. Species 



 
 
 
Chapter 2 

34 
 

capture rates (capture/1000 trap-nights) per weight class were used to visually compare 
capture efficiency by method, family and species. 

Odds ratio meta-analysis was performed on capture data pooled by family using 

STATSDIRECT® statistical package, for each of the following pairs of methods: 60L pitfall 

versus 30L pitfall; Sherman traps versus Tomahawk trap; live traps versus pitfalls. For 
each comparison, only families captured in both methods under comparison were included 

in the analysis. We excluded from this analysis the accidental captures of: 1) Hylidae, in 

comparison among pitfalls, since these are not true captures individuals could easily 

escape from buckets; 2) Iguanidae, Polychrotidae and Scincidae, in comparison among 

live traps and pitfalls since only one individual of each family was captured in live traps. 

Estimation of independent (family) and pooled odds-ratio weights the number of 

positive (capture) and negative cases (empty trap/pitfall), for both trap type. Thus, the 

calculation accounted for differences in trap-night numbers between different traps. 

Heterogeneity among independent odds-ratios was estimated in the analysis, using the 

inconsistency index I2 (Higgins et al. 2003). A model accounting for random effects was 

chosen for estimating pooled odds-ratios (DerSimonian &amp;amp; Laird 1986). Confidence 

intervals (95%) for the independent and pooled estimates were also calculated in the 

analysis. 

One-tailed t-test for unpaired samples was performed for statistical comparison 
between the average numbers of mammal recaptures, per night, in pitfalls, for: (1) one 

sampling period during dry season (9 nights, August 2007) and (2) total sampling time (84 

nights). Our goal was to test the hypothesis that the average number of recaptures per 

night was higher during that particular dry season. 

 

 

2.5 – Results 

During this study, 2286 individuals were captured: 1507 amphibians (five families), 

325 lizards (ten families) and 454 small mammals (three families). Total numbers of trap-

nights (Table 2.1) were as follows: Sherman traps (8580 trap-nights); Tomahawk traps 

(3900); 30L pitfalls (6159) and 60L pitfalls (4079). Global capture rates were higher for 

30L (15.12%) and 60L pitfalls (22.16%) than for Sherman (3.62%) and Tomahawk traps 

(4.10%) (Table I). Capture rates for amphibians in 30L and 60L pitfalls were very high 

compared with other vertebrate groups. Recaptures in pitfalls and live traps only occurred

for mammals and teiid lizards. A negligible number of amphibian recaptures was observed 

in pipe traps and during active search.

Sixty-seven vertebrate species (Table 2.2) were captured: 29 amphibian, 20 lizard 

and 18 small mammal species. Pitfalls captured 15 amphibian, 12 lizard and 14 small 

mammal species. From all these species, 7 were unique to pitfalls. Live traps captured 6 

lizard and 12 small mammal species. Only 3 small mammal species were unique to live 

traps. Additional methods accounted for the highest number of amphibian (active search – 

26 spp.; pipe traps – 8 spp.) and lizard species (active search – 15 spp.), but captured 

only 3 small mammal species (active search – 1 sp.; pipe traps – 2 spp.). Additional 

methods also accounted for the highest number of unique species: 8 amphibian and 6 

lizard species by active search and 3 amphibian species in pipe traps.

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna

All small mammal families (Didelphidae, Cricetidae and Echimyidae) and one lizard family 

(Teiidae) were consistently captured in live traps and pitfalls (Figure 2.2). With exception 

to some accidental captures in live traps, other lizard or amphibian families were only 

captured in pitfalls (Figure 2.3).

Smaller teiid species were mainly captured in pitfalls. Ameiva ameiva (Linnaeus, 
1758) was also frequently captured in Sherman traps. Tupinambis teguixin (Linnaeus, 
1758), the largest species of the family occurring in the area, was almost exclusively 
captured in Tomahawk traps. Larger didelphids were mainly captured in Tomahawk traps 

and, to a lesser extent, in Sherman traps and 60L pitfalls. Smaller didelphid species, such 



 
 
 
Chapter 2 

40 
 

as Marmosa murina (Linnaeus, 1758), were mainly captured in Sherman traps. Larger 
cricetids were captured more frequently in Sherman traps and 60L pitfalls. Smaller 

cricetids were mainly captured in pitfalls, particularly in the larger ones. Echimyids were 

almost only captured in live traps. 

Captures rates for amphibian taxa were consistently higher for 60L pitfalls, but 

both pitfalls captured individuals within the same weight-range. Families Leiuperidae, 

Leptodactylidae and Microhylidae were the major contributors to the observed capture 

rates. One or two species per family – Pseudopaludicola mystacalis (Cope, 1887, 
Leiuperidae) and Physalaemus cuvieri (Fitzinger, 1826, Leuiperidae), Leptodactylus 
leptodactyloides (Andersson, 1945, Leptodactylidae) and Elachistocleis ovalis (Schneider, 
1799, Microhylidae), respectively – accounted for most of the captures, with a large 

proportion of juveniles in the latter three species. For lizard taxa, 30L and 60L also 

captured individuals within the same weight-range. 

Heterogeneity estimates for odds-ratio analysis, using the inconsistency index (I2) 

were: 67.0%, 90.0% and 97.0%, respectively. Heterogeneity among independent 

estimates (families) was globally high. Therefore, we used a random model to estimate 

the pooled odds-ratios. For overall comparisons (Figure 2.4), combined odds-ratio was 

only significantly different from 1 in the pair 60L/30L pitfalls (1.50, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.88), 

where we can state that capture odds in favour of 60L pitfalls were about one and a half 

times greater than in 30L pitfalls. 

In familial comparisons between pitfalls of different size: Bufonidae (5.15, 95% CI 

= 1.82 to 17.87), Leiuperidae (1.43, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.66, Leptodactylidae (1.62, 95% CI = 

1.32 to 1.99), Microhylidae (1.65, 95% CI = 1.31 to 2.08) and Didelphidae capture odds 

(7.34, 95% CI = 2.99 to 21.65) were significantly greater in favour of 60L pitfalls. For the 

pair Sherman/Tomahawk traps, capture odds were significantly greater for: Cricetidae 

(42.27, 95% CI = 7.39 to 1687.94), in favour of Sherman traps; and for Teiidae (0.50, 95% 

CI = 0.33 to 0.74), in favour of Tomahawk traps. For the pair live traps/pitfalls, capture 

odds were significantly greater for: Didelphidae (4.43, 95% CI = 3.09 to 6.54) and 

Echimyidae (16.33, 95% CI = 4.27 to 138.85), in favour of live traps; and for Teiidae (0.59, 

95% CI = 0.45 to 0.76), in favour of pitfall traps.

During the peak of the 2007 dry season, we detected that small mammals were 

being recaptured in pitfalls more frequently than average (for the total sampling period).

Thus, we compared the recapture rates between the dry season and the total sampling 

period. Mean number of mammal recaptures per night, in pitfalls, during the peak of 2007 

dry season (1.00 ± 0.71, n = 9) was significantly greater (t = 3.919, df = 91, p &amp;lt;0.0001) 
than mean number of mammal recaptures per night, in pitfalls, during total sampling 

period (0.26 ± 0.52, n = 84). 

 

 

2.6 – Discussion 

 
2.6.1 – Amphibians 

Most amphibians present a typical sit-and-wait foraging strategy, using mainly 

visual cues for prey detection (Duellman &amp;amp; Trueb 1994). Baited live traps were primarily 

designed for capturing small mammals, which forage actively, using olfactory cues. This 

behavioural difference might be the reason for the absence of amphibian captures in live 

traps, as occurred in this study. There is no reason to believe that sit-and-wait predators 

would be more prone to fall inside pitfalls than to enter in live traps. However, animals 

might be captured simply because they move at some extent. Drift-fences enlarge the 

area of influence of pitfalls, by driving individuals into the buckets, and thus there is a 

higher probability of being intercepted by the drift-fences than by live traps. On the other 

hand, pitfalls allow multiple captures. 

Several amphibians present explosive breeding behaviour and tend to be 

gregarious in early stages of life (Wells 2007). This behaviour was already reported for 

genus Elachistocleis, Leptodactylus and Physalaemus (Barreto &amp;amp; Andrade 1995; 
Rodrigues et al. 2003; Brasileiro et al. 2005), and is probably the reason for the observed 

high capture-rate for juveniles of some amphibian species. Despite the large capture 

rates, amphibians were never recaptured in pitfalls. Their low vagility (Blaustein et al. 

1994), associated to the fact that they were released at some distance from capture 

location, probably contributed to this result. 

Additional methods substantially increased the number of captured species. 

Several were unique species from families Hylidae (5 species) and Leptodactylidae (3 

species), and one species was the single representative of the family Craugastoridae, in 

this study. Other authors had already suggested that the use of several methods is critical 

for adequately sampling herpetofauna (Greenberg et al. 1994; Crosswhite et al. 1999; 

Hutchens &amp;amp; DePerno 2009). 



 
 
 

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna

During fieldwork, several individuals from smaller weight classes were observed 

trying to climb pitfall walls. We suspect that even for smaller individuals, there is a chance 

of escape that is inversely proportional to the depth of the pitfall. Largest differences in 

capture rates between different pitfalls were for individuals from the lower weight classes, 

but also for medium-size leptodactylids. Leptodactylids are good jumpers and 30L pitfalls 

may be too shallow to prevent the escape of adult individuals of medium to large species. 

Bufonids, on the other hand, are not good jumpers, and even the larger ones were 

captured in both pitfalls. Larger pitfalls were more efficient than smaller ones for capturing 

amphibians.  

 

2.6.22 – Lizards 
Lizards can be broadly classified as widely (or active) foragers or as sit-and-wait 

(or ambush) predators, according to foraging mode (Miles et al. 2007). Sit-and-wait 

behaviour is frequently reported in families Polychrotidae, Tropiduridae (Iguania) and in 

Neotropical Gekkota (Gekkonidae, Sphaerodactylidae and Phyllodactylidae); while 

Teiidae, Gymnophtalmidae and Scincidae generally present active foraging behaviour 

(Colli et al. 2007; Vitt &amp;amp; Zani 1998a, 1998b; Miles et al. 2007). Teiids are active foragers 

that use mainly chemical signals for prey capture and discrimination (Cooper 2007), and it 

is likely that they were attracted to bait in live traps, like mammals. Capture rates, in live 

traps, were similar for teiids and small mammals. Recapture rates were however 

substantially lower for teiids.  

Live traps failed to capture any other lizard family efficiently. Several causes can 

be suggested for this result. Iguania and Gekkota lizard families are mainly composed of 

ambush predators, as already discussed. Amphisbaenids are highly specialized fossorial 

squamates (Colli &amp;amp; Zamboni 1999). Family Scincidae also includes several ambush 

predators, such as genus Mabuya (Brown &amp;amp; Nagy 2007). The gymnophtalmid lizard 
Micrablepharus atticolus is an active predator, but specialized in ants (Rodrigues 1996), 
and is usually found near to ant and termite mounds. Live traps were significantly less 

efficient in capturing teiids, than pitfalls. Among live traps, Tomahwak traps appear to be 

the most suitable for capturing teiids. However, as already mentioned, there is a strong 

bias from small species towards Sherman traps, and from larger species towards 

Tomahawk traps. 

Teiids and gymnophtalmids were the most captured lizards, in pitfalls. Besides 

feeding strategy, one probable cause is that they are more active on ground. The 



 
 
 
Chapter 2 

44 
 

polychrotid Anolis nitens (Wagler, 1930, Polychrotidae) was the third most captured lizard, 
and also spends much time in leaf-litter (Vitt et al. 2008a). All other species that occur in 

the area have arboreal or fossorial habits (Vitt et al. 2008b). 

 

2.6.3 – Small mammals 
Endothermy demands a high energetic cost and mammals spend much of their 

time searching for food (Townsend et al. 2008). This physiological constraint is probably 

on of the reasons why live traps (baited) were globally more efficient for small mammals, 

than pitfalls (non-baited). If capture rates are pooled for pitfalls and live traps, didelphids 

and echimyids were captured significantly more often in live traps. Only cricetids were 

more frequently captured in pitfalls but this result was not significant. For this family, 

capture rate in Sherman traps was much higher than in Tomahawk traps. One possible 

explanation is that Tomahawk traps are not suitable for capturing cricetids, simply 

because most individuals do not have enough weight to trigger the trap. Alternatively, they 

could be able to escape through the trap mesh, as already suggested by Lyra-Jorge &amp;amp; 

Pivello (2001). Our study supports this hypothesis in that only individuals from weight 

class V were captured in Tomahawk traps but individuals from lower weight classes were 

captured both in Sherman traps and in pitfalls. Considering only Sherman traps, capture 

rate was almost twice the average rate for pitfalls. In general, recapture rates were also 

higher for live traps than for pitfalls, except for recapture rate of echimyids in Tomahawk 

traps, which was very low. 

The overall number of small mammal species captured in pitfalls (14spp.) was 

greater than in live traps (12spp). This finding is in agreement with those from previous 

authors (Umetsu et al. 2006, Caceres et al. 2011). However, there were differences 

between the three mammal families. Pitfalls captured more species of cricetids, while live 

traps captured more echimyids and didelphids. Additional methods used in this study were 

mostly ineffective for capturing small mammals but two arboreal species, which were 

rarely (Caluromys philander Linaeus, 1758) or never (Rhipidomys sp. nov., Rocha et al. in 
press) captured in live traps or pitfalls, were found dead in pipe traps. 

Capture odds for didelphids were significantly greater in favour of larger pitfalls. A 

possible explanation is that smaller pitfalls cannot prevent the escape of larger individuals, 

as already stated by several authors (Lyra-Jorge &amp;amp; Pivello 2001; Hice &amp;amp; Schmidly 2002; 

Umetsu 2006). Echimyids were rarely captured in pitfalls and only in the larger ones. 

Cricetids were not captured in significantly higher rates in any type of pitfall, possibly 



 
 
 

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna 

45 
 

because both pitfalls were effective in preventing the escape of most of the captured 

individuals. Sherman and Tomahawk traps appeared to be equally suitable for capturing 

echimyids. Sherman traps, which in this study were larger than standard ones (Slade et 

al. 1993), clearly did not capture larger individuals from family Didelphidae as efficiently as 

Tomahawks. 

 

2.6.4 – Trap-habit behaviour in pitfalls 
Recapture rate for didelphids was higher than recapture rate for any other taxa, in 

larger pitfalls. This recapture rate was in fact comparable to those from live traps. In this 

study, didelphids generally presented the highest capture and recapture rates, suggesting 

the existence of trap-habit behaviour, which is frequently referred to in literature for live 

traps (Sealander &amp;amp; James 1958; Woodman et al. 1996; Umetsu et al. 2006). However, we 

found no references in literature that related trap-habit behaviour to pitfalls. 

From 22 mammal recaptures in 60L pitfalls during the entire sampling, nine 

occurred in the sampling period of the 2007 dry season. Only three didelphids (two 

Didelphis marsupialis Linnaeus, 1758 and one Philander opossum Linnaeus, 1758) were 
recaptured in the referred sampling period. We hypothesized that these captured 

individuals were intentionally entering pitfalls. The number of recaptures during this period 

was significantly greater than recapture number for total period. We consider that there is 

enough evidence for trap-habit behaviour, eventually caused by the availability of a limited 

resource, inside the pitfalls. During the dry season, water was frequently dropped into the 

buckets. On the other hand, arthropods were frequently captured inside pitfalls. We 

cannot be sure if these individuals were being attracted by the water or by the arthropods. 

Both species commonly include arthropods in their diet (Emmons &amp;amp; Feer 1997). It is 

possible that, in response to the seasonal scarcity of fruits, seeds and arthropods in this 

region (Vieira 2003), these individuals found a suitable source of food inside the pitfalls. 

 

2.6.5 – Final Considerations 
Species within a family share several common features (e.g. ecological, 

morphological, behavioural), because of their shared ancestry. Based on our results, we 

suggest that the foraging strategy of different taxa can influence the efficiency of a given 

method. Taxonomically distinct taxa that present similar foraging strategy tend to be 

captured by the same techniques. One example is the unexpectedly capture efficiency of 

live traps revealed for teiids, despite the fact that these traps were primarily designed for 



 
 
 
Chapter 2 

46 
 

mammals. The same way, vagility and size of individuals could affect capture rates for 

different methods. In this study, differences in size between two rodent families (Cricetidae 

and Echimyidae) or within the lizard family Teiidae reflected in significant differences in 

capture efficiency of distinct methods. This variation within vertebrate taxa must be 

considered when designing sampling strategy, or diversity might be underestimated. 

Ambush predators, which include all anurans and most lizards in this study, were 

captured in pitfalls, but not in live traps. In addition, if pitfalls had not been used, eight 

species would not have been captured. This was the least selective method, capturing 

across all vertebrate taxa. Despite the initial effort of putting up pitfall lines, we suggest 

that these should be used together with other methods, particularly in short-term studies, 

when local biodiversity must be surveyed within a small period. 

About one third of the species found in this study were unique to active search or 

pipe traps. These methods were not efficient for small mammals but, for herpetofauna, 

they represented a substantial increase in species number. This result stresses the 

importance of alternative methods, which are sometimes easier to implement and with 

lower cost (Hutchens &amp;amp; DePerno 2009). Our results show that diversifying capture 

methods increases the number of captured species, and thus species richness estimates, 

corroborating the findings of previous authors, in other regions (Mengak &amp;amp; Guyn 1987; 

Greenberg et al. 1994; Voss &amp;amp; Emmons 1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999; Umetsu 2006). We 

expect that our results and considerations will help researchers and other wildlife 

professionals to design sampling strategies that provide a more accurate picture of the 

state of biodiversity, in a region of fast-evolving human impact.

3.1 – Abstract 

We evaluated the usefulness of arboreal pipe refuges for studying Neotropical 

herpetofauna, by surveying the colonizing species and assessing if significant 

correlations between species and microhabitat variables could be found. Additionally, 

we assessed the influence of pipe colour on the colonization success. We used fifty-

five sets of three refuges (white, grey and black). We registered 122 colonization 

events by four Hylidae and one Scincidae species. Refuge colour did not significantly 

affect colonization success. Environmental data explained a significant portion (10.6%) 

of total variance of species data. The variables vegetal type and insertion height 

presented the highest correlation with species data.

3.2 – Introduction 

Tree frogs are easily observed in breeding sites, during the mating season but, 

due to their elusive behaviour, they are not easily detected outside these areas and 

periods (Pittman et al., 2008). For this reason, the knowledge about their biology 

outside of breeding habitats is limited (Lemckert, 2004). This lack of knowledge is 

critical, because terrestrial areas surrounding breeding habitats are crucial for the 

survival of amphibian populations (Marsh &amp;amp; Trenham, 2000; Semlitsch &amp;amp; Bodie, 2003). 

Even species with long reproductive season spend more time in terrestrial habitats 

(Wilbur, 1984). In the case of some Neotropical hylids, reproductive cycles are related 

to arboreal microhabitats such as tree holes and bromeliads (Haddad &amp;amp; Sawaya, 2000; 

Haddad &amp;amp; Prado, 2005). 

Artificial pipe refuges have been suggested as an alternative sampling 

methodology for hylids (Boughton et al., 2000; Johnson, 2005; Myers et al., 2007). 

Pipes can be installed on trees or in the ground, allowing its use in forest habitats and 

reproductive areas. This methodology was successfully used in ecological (Mahan &amp;amp; 

Johnson, 2007; Liner et al, 2008; Pittman et al., 2008) and conservation studies 

(Schurbon &amp;amp; Fauth, 2003; Wyatt and Forys, 2004). Colonization success of pipe 

refuges can be influenced by: pipe diameter (Bartareau, 2004); placement of pipes 

(Myers et al., 2007); sex and size of tree frogs, and tree species (Johnson et al, 2008); 

and tree frog species (Hoffman et al (2009). The effect of refuge colour on the 



 

54 
 

colonization success of pipe refuges was never studied, but Crawford and Kurta (2000) 

found that anurans were more efficiently captured in black pitfalls than in white ones. 

These authors suggested that anurans might perceive light-coloured traps as different 

from the substrate and avoid them, or dark traps as potential refuge and enter them. 

We hypothesize that colour might indirectly influence the colonization of artificial 

refuges, in the same way, because of differences in luminosity between lighter (white) 

and darker (black and grey) refuges. 

Despite the high tree frog diversity in the Neotropics, pipe refuges are not 

commonly used in this region, judging from the lack of published references to its use 

(but see: Laurencio &amp;amp; Malone, 2009; Silva &amp;amp; Rossa-Feres, 2007). Our aim was to 

assess the usefulness of pipe refuges for biodiversity surveys and ecological studies in 

Neotropical habitats by: surveying which tree frog species colonize the refuges; and 

assessing if correlations between environmental and species data can be obtained. We 

also aimed to assess whether or not pipe colour influences colonization success. 

 

 

3.3. – Methods 

This study was conducted in two different areas at the ecotonal region between 

Cerrado and Amazonia, in Brazil: one at the mid-Araguaia River, including Parque 

Estadual do Cantão (PEC, east bank, state of Tocantins) and Fazenda Santa Fé (FSF, 

western bank, state of Pará); the other at Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV, state of 

Tocantins). PEC is a 90,000 ha state conservation unit mainly composed by seasonally 

flooded forests. FSF is a 65,000ha private ranch with 65% of its area covered by well-

preserved semi-deciduous tropical forest. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch with 70% of 

the area constituted by pristine Cerrado physiognomies. Natural forest fragments 

(ipucas) occur within the agricultural and Cerrado matrices. 
Three sampling points were placed in PEC, two in FSF and three in FLV. We 

used 55 sets of three arboreal pipe refuges (one of each colour: white, grey and black). 

Five sets of pipes were installed in each sampling point in PEC and FSF, and ten in 

each sampling point in FLV. Pipes were installed at two heights: above head and waist 

level. Pipe refuges were adapted from Johnson (2005): length – 40cm; inner diameter 

– 4cm; maximum water level – 8cm. 

Each area was sampled during three periods of seven days each: end of rain 

season (April to May 2008), dry season (June to September 2008) and beginning of 



 
 
 

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna 

55 
 

rain season (October to November 2008). Refuges were visited every two days during 

the sampling periods, totalizing twelve visits per sampling point. Arboreal pipe refuges 
were only removed at the end of the study. Captured individuals were individually 

marked with visible implant elastomer and released about 30m away from capture 

location. The first three individuals of each species were collected as voucher 

specimens and deposited at Coleção Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília 

(CHUNB). The snout-vent length (SVL) of all individuals was measured prior to 

collection or releasing.  

For each arboreal pipe refuge, the following environmental variables were 

measured: height of opening; perimeter of insertion branch; perimeter of widest branch 

on insertion tree/shrub; distance to widest branch; number of branches; angle of 

insertion; percentage of canopy cover; vegetal type (tree or shrub) and bark rugosity 

[from smooth (0) to very rugose (3)]. Damages to pipe refuges were classified 

according to its intensity: no damages (0), and minor (1), moderate (2) or severe 

damages (3). Refuges were repaired or replaced whenever needed. 

Individuals were always released relatively far from capture location, thus 

recaptures were considered independent colonization events and included in the 

analysis. We estimated the mean, minimum and maximum SVL of each captured 

species. We searched for significant differences in average number of captures and 

damage intensity among differently coloured refuges. Numbers of captured individuals 

per species were considered insufficient for independent statistical comparisons. Thus, 
statistical analysis was performed based on the total number of captured individuals. 

Our data did not conform the assumptions of homocedasticity and normality of 

distribution. Therefore, multiple comparisons were made using Kruskall-Wallis test. 

Pairwise comparisons were performed using Dwass-Steel-Chritchlow-Fligner test. Both 

tests were performed using STATSDIRECT®, considering a 0.05 significance level. 

Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed using CANOCO® for Windows®, to search 

for correlation between environmental and species data. Sampling point and refuge 

colour were included as covariates in RDA. The null hypothesis of independence 

between species and environmental data sets was tested using a Monte Carlo test, 

with 1000 permutations. The significance test (p=0.05) was run for the first canonical 
axis and for all axes together.

3.4 – Results 

We registered 114 colonization events by hylids (4 recaptures) and eight by the 

skink Mabuya frenata. A maximum of three individuals of Trachycephalus venulosus 
were found simultaneously colonizing the same pipe. Average SVL for captured 

species (Table 3.1) varied from 16.7 ± 1.71 mm (Scinax fuscomarginatus), to 53.2 ± 
16.24 mm (Osteocephalus taurinus). The smallest individual colonizing the pipes was a 
S. fuscomarginatus (SVL = 14.2 mm), and the largest was an O. taurinus (SVL = 74.5 
mm). We found no significant effect of colour on the average number of individuals per 

refuge (white, 0.84 ± 1.014; gray, 0.54 ± 0.741; black, 0.84 ± 1.102), for simultaneous 

comparison of all samples (groups = 3; df = 2, total observations = 165; T = 2.2403; p = 
0.326). Several refuges were damaged during the study and sometimes were found 

lying at the base of insertion trees. Simultaneous comparison of all samples (groups = 

3; df = 2, total observations = 165; T = 14.5037; p = 0.001) revealed a significant effect 
of colour on the average damage level of the arboreal refuges (white, 0.58 ± 0.956; 

gray, 0.11 ± 0.369; black, 0.13 ± 0.388).

Pairwise comparisons (critical q = 3.3145; df = 162) revealed that average damage 
level in white refuges was significantly greater than in grey (p = 0.004) and black (p = 
0.010) refuges, whereas there was no significant difference (p = 0.948) between the 
latter two.

Figure 3.1 – RDA correlation biplot. Species – black solid lines; environmental variables (EV) – 

dotted grey lines and capitalized letters; Centroids from classes “tree” and “shrub” of nominal 

EV “vegetal type” – grey-filled circles. 

 

The two first canonical axes of the RDA (Figure 3.1) explained 9.9% of 

cumulative percentage variance of species data. The sum of all canonical eigenvalues 

was 0.086, accounting for 10.6% of total variance of the species data. The portion of 

variance explained by the first and by all canonical axes was significantly greater than 

expected by chance alone (p = 0.003 and p=0.016, respectively). Vegetal type was the 
variable most correlated with the first environmental axis (tree – 0.380; and shrub – - 

0.550) and the first species axis (tree – 0.178; and shrub – - 0.258). Insertion height 

was the variable most correlated with the second environmental (0.752) and the 

second species (0.201) axes. Relatively to the vegetal type, the score of the class 

“tree” was higher than for class “shrub”, for both Scinax species, and the inverse 
occurred for T. venulosus and O. taurinus. The latter two species presented strong 
positive correlation with the variable insertion height, while S. fuscomarginatus 
presented strong negative correlation and Scinax gr. ruber and M. frenata were not 
correlated with this variable.

3.5 – Discussion 

Our results confirm the colonization of artificial arboreal refuges by four hylid 

species. A pilot survey, performed by us, revealed that four other – Dendropsophus 
minutus, D. nanus, D. rubicundulus and Hypsiboas raniceps – were able to colonize 
pipes placed around ponds. The presence of other six species in the region – 

Dendropsophus melanargyreus, Hypsiboas fasciatus, H. punctatus, H. albopunctatus, 
Phyllomedusa azurea and Scinax nebulosus – is documented by the voucher 
specimens (CHUNB44914–46212) collected by Guarino Colli and collaborators and 

deposited at Colecção Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília. Hylid species that 

colonized the arboreal refuges are typical of forested or border areas (e.g. O. taurinus) 
and/or disturbed areas (e.g. S. gr. ruber) (Lutz, 1973; Lima et al., 2006). Species from 
genus Trachycephalus, including T. venulosus, are frequently found in hollow metal 
tubes containing water (Lutz 1973). All other species, that were found in ground pipes 

in the pilot study, or that did not colonized the arboreal pipes at all, are more frequent in 

open areas (Lutz 1973; Brasileiro et al. 2008). Some, like the small Dendropsophus 
species, are more frequently found in herbaceous vegetation at the margin of water 

bodies (Lutz 1973). Some of the smallest and largest species occurring in this region 

colonized the refuges. Therefore, the size and diameter of pipes do not appear to have 

limited the size of colonizing species. On the other hand, arboreal refuges were placed 

at the core or edge of forested patches and this might have restricted the range of 

colonizing species. We believe that if arboreal pipes are placed in more open habitats 

more species will be able to colonize the artificial refuges. On the other hand, if the 

objective is to maximize the number of captured species, than placing the refuges near 

reproduction areas might be more efficient. 

The skink Mabuya frenata also colonized the arboreal refuges. Colonization of 
pipe refuges by lizards had already been reported by Johnson (2005). These findings 

suggest that artificial refuges might also be useful for studying other groups of 

herpetofauna. 

Our results reveal that pipe refuges are more useful to survey Neotropical 

herpetofauna than suggested by previous studies (Silva &amp;amp; Rossa-Feres 2007; 

Laurencio &amp;amp; Malone, 2009), where none or only a few species and individuals 

colonized pipe refuges. In the study by Laurencio &amp;amp; Malone (2009), seven individuals 

from three species were captured in ground pipes, but none was captured in pipes 

placed in the canopy. However, almost fifty percent of the species sampled in the area 



 
 
 

Capturing Small Mammals and Herpetofauna 

59 
 

were not captured in the refuges, and none of the captured species was only captured 

in the refuges. These results indicate that artificial refuges might be less usefull for 

species surveys, than for ecological studies aiming arboreal species. 

Our results suggest that refuge colour did not affect colonization success, 

contrarily to our initial hypothesis based on the findings of Crawford &amp;amp; Kurta (2000). 

However, darker refuges were less prone to damage, and its use might be preferable 

because it would minimize the effort of fixing or substituting damaged refuges. 

Despite the small number of colonization events, it was possible to explain a 

significant portion of the total variance of species data. The two environmental 

variables most correlated with species data were the height of insertion and the vegetal 

type. Boughton et al (2000) also found evidence for the influence of height of insertion 

on the colonization success by Hyla species. In their study, refuges placed higher in 
trees were more efficient than those at ground level. In our study, colonization by T. 
venulosus and O. taurinus was positively correlated with the insertion height, while 
colonization by S. fuscomarginatus was negatively correlated with this variable. 
Differences among species also occurred relatively to their frequency either on trees or 

shrubs. 

More than helping to determine which factors influence colonization success, 

analyzing the microhabitat characteristics of artificial refuges can help us to understand 

the ecological preferences of hylids (Johnson &amp;amp; Semlitsch, 2003; Pittman et al., 2008). 

Considering the number of species and the ecological and reproductive diversity of tree 

frogs in the Neotropics, we believe that pipe refuges might become an important 

methodology in ecological studies in this region.

4.1 – Abstract 

The Araguaia River basin lies along the ecotone between Amazonia and 

Cerrado, being one of the regions most threatened by deforestation and habitat 

degradation. Conservation units in the middle Araguaia present different levels of 

protection and habitat heterogeneity. According to the theory of spatial heterogeneity, 

more heterogeneous landscapes sustain greater diversity. Higher species richness are 

also frequently associated with ecotones. In addition, the middle Araguaia basin has 

also been suggested as a Pleistocene refuge for forest species. With the aim of 

clarifying these questions, we: (1) estimated anuran and lizard species richness in 

three conservation units; (2) assessed the contribution of Amazonia and Cerrado 

herpetofaunas for the regional assemblages; (3) and compared our species richness 

estimates with estimates from other Amazonian and Cerrado localities. We compiled 

data from two field campaigns performed between 2005 and 2008. Thirty-eight anuran, 

20 lizard, 26 snake and two amphisbaenian species were found in the study area. 

Anuran and lizard species richness was significantly larger in the more heterogeneous 

buffer area, rather than in the strict conservation unit. Our results support the theory of 

spatial heterogeneity and previous findings that Cerrado lizard fauna is more diverse in 

the interfluvial areas than in gallery forests. Our results did not corroborate the role of 

the middle Araguaia basin as a refuge for forest species, nor the hypothesis that 

transitional areas bear higher diversity than surrounding biomes. This study provides a 

good example of the importance of environmental buffer areas, not only in reducing 

impacts on other conservation units, but also in the effective conservation of the 

regional biota.

4.2 – Introduction 

The Brazilian Cerrado is the only tropical savanna among the twenty-five 

biodiversity hotspots proposed by Myers et al (2000), and Amazonian Rainforest is 

considered the largest and most diverse major tropical wilderness area (Mittermeier et 

al 1998). The Araguaia River runs between these two large and diverse biomes, and its 

basin is considered a biodiversity hotspot for plants as well (Oliveira-Filho &amp;amp; Ratter, 

2002). Moreover, the middle Araguaia river, Coco river (a tributary), and Bananal Island 



 
 
 
Chapter 4 

66 
 

were also listed as priority areas for conservation within Cerrado (Cavalcanti &amp;amp; Joly, 

2002). 

Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), in Bananal Island, was the first 

Amazonian park; originally comprising an area of 20,000 Km2, it was later reduced to a 

quarter of its original extent (Mittermeier et al, 2005). Recent conflicts between 

conservation authorities (ICMBio – Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da 

Biodiversidade) and indigenous people, motivated by the overlap between the park and 

the indigenous lands at its southern border, remain unsolved (MPF-TO, 2010). The 

establishment of Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC), in 1998 (Tocantins state law 

nº996, 14/07/1998), granted protection to a large area of alluvial forests in the 

confluence of Araguaia and Coco Rivers. A large environmental buffer area, Área de 

Proteção Ambiental do Bananal/Cantão (APABC), was created one year before 

(Tocantins state law nº907 from 20/05/1997) to limit the human impacts in PEC and 

PNA. A later attempt to reduce the buffer area to about one tenth of its original size, by 

the state government of Tocantins, was stopped by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF-

TO, 2005). 

In addition to political and social tension regarding the establishment of 

conservation units, Amazonia and Cerrado biomes face other threats. Deforestation of 

Cerrado has been faster and more intense than in Amazonia, and it is estimated that 

60% of this biome is now under direct human use (Klink &amp;amp; Moreira, 2002). Despite 

being lower, deforestation rates in Amazonia are not uniform and become higher at the 

agricultural frontier, in the contact zone with Cerrado (Foley et al 2007), affecting 27% 

of the original extent of Xingu’s area of endemism (Silva et al, 2005). One of the 

reasons of the asymmetry between these two biomes is that Brazilian law requires that 

80% of the forested area should be preserved in each holding in Amazonia, but this 

percentage is only 20% in Cerrado (Klink &amp;amp; Machado, 2005). Only 2.2% of Cerrado’s 

original extent is under any legal protection (Klink &amp;amp; Machado, 2005). Fire (Fearnside 

2005; Hoffman &amp;amp; Moreira 2002), habitat fragmentation (Carvalho et al 2009), and 

introduction of African grasses (Klink &amp;amp; Machado 2005, Pivello et al 1999) also 

contribute actively to the degradation of these biomes, which in turn threatens the 

persistence of many vertebrate populations (Paglia &amp;amp; Fonseca 2009). Cerrado 

deforestation promotes the erosion and alteration of flowing pattern of the Araguaia 

river basin (Latrubesse et al. 2009). Because of the fast pace of deforestation and 



 
 
 

On the Importance of Buffer Areas 

67 
 

habitat loss, the Amazonia/Cerrado frontier is considered a priority area for new studies 

(Azevedo-Ramos &amp;amp; Gallati, 2002). 

Contrary to the early recognition of high plant diversity in Cerrado, first works 

about the Cerrado herpetofauna suggested low differentiation, low rate of endemism, 

and lack of distinctiveness (Duellman 1979; Vanzolini 1988; Silva &amp;amp; Sites 1995). Colli et 

al. (2002) refuted these claims, stating that the horizontal habitat variability in Cerrado 

balanced the vertical variability typical of forested habitats, resulting in similar levels of 

local species richness. Recent studies about the structure of Cerrado lizard fauna 

(Nogueira et al., 2005; Nogueira et al., 2009) revealed that it is mainly composed of 

habitat specialists, with little faunal overlap between gallery forests and open 

formations. This pattern was also found for small mammals (Alho, 2005). The studies 

by Nogueira et al. (2005, 2009) also revealed that lizard richness in Cerrado was 

greater in open formations than in gallery forests, revealing an opposite pattern to that 

observed for birds (Silva, 1997; Silva and Bates 2002) and mammals (Redford &amp;amp; 

Fonseca, 1986). 

In the last decade, several attempts were made, based on macro-scale 

analyses, to identify patterns of diversity of squamates and anurans in Cerrado (Costa 

et al 2007; Diniz-Filho et al 2004, 2007), and to predict a network of conservation areas 

that maximizes the conservation of Cerrado anurans using the smallest possible area 

(Diniz-Filho et al 2004, 2006). In all these approaches, the middle Araguaia basin was 

estimated to have lower species richness than average. However, according to Bini et 

al. (2006), there is a generalized deficiency of sampling in the northern region of 

Cerrado. According to these authors, the middle Araguaia region presents a high 

potential to harbor amphibian species yet to be described. Recent studies in the middle 

Araguaia basin revealed high species richness of birds (Pinheiro &amp;amp; Dornas, 2009) and 

small mammals (Rocha et al, 2011), with the description of a new species, in the latter 

case. 

The conservation units from the middle Araguaia present different conservation 

statuses and most importantly, different habitat characteristics. While PEC (strict 

conservation) is mostly composed of gallery and alluvial forests, highly subjected to 

seasonal flooding; APABC (buffer area) is more heterogeneous and less influenced by 

flooding regime, combining both closed, transitional and open formations. According to 

the theory of spatial heterogeneity, the more heterogeneous and complex the physical 

environment becomes, the more complex and diverse the plant and animal 



 
 
 
Chapter 4 

68 
 

communities supported by that environment (Pianka et al, 1966, Richerson &amp;amp; Lum, 

1980; Guégan et al, 2006). This greater diversity might be related to the presence of 

keystone structures, essential to particular species or faunal groups (Tews et al., 

2004). One example comes from our study area, where the species Gymnodactylus 
carvalhoi was found to be restricted to termite mounds (Vitt et al., 2006), which are 
frequent in open Cerrado formations. Based on differences in habitat heterogeneity, we 

predict that APABC would present higher species diversity than PEC. 

The Araguaia River basin was also proposed as a subspecies-endemicity 

center, highly correlated with the presence of paleoecological forest refuges for 

Neotropical forest butterflies (Brown 1982). Later, this region was also proposed as a 

refuge for forest bird species during the climate fluctuations of the Quarternary (Silva, 

1997; Silva &amp;amp; Bates, 2002). If the middle Araguaia River was a historical refuge for 

lizard and amphibian forest species, in the same manner as for butterfly and bird 

species, we would predict an higher proportion of species and endemics associated to 

forest habitats, and thus to the alluvial and gallery forests of PEC (Silva, 1995). In 

addition, ecotones are sometimes considered a source of higher species diversity and 

evolutionary novelty (Yahner, 1988; Risser, 1995; Smith et al., 1997). Therefore, 

because of the confluence of the Cerrado and Amazonian biome in this area, we would 

also predict higher species richness than the average for Cerrado or Amazonian 

localities. 

In order to clarify these issues, and using data collected by us and other 

workers, we: (1) estimated the species richness of amphibians and lizards in each 

conservation unit; (2) assessed the contribution of Amazonia and Cerrado 

herpetofaunas in the regional species assemblage (3) compared estimates of anuran 

and squamate richness of this region with estimates for other Amazonian and Cerrado 

localities, and with estimates for the entire Cerrado biome, based on macro-scale 

approaches. The understanding of the partitioning of faunal richness across the 

different conservation units in the middle Araguaia is important because of the different 

conservation statuses and also because of the recent attempts to reduce the size of 

APABC. Increasingly more complete species lists for the whole region will also help to 

understand the contribution of Amazonian and Cerrado faunas to the regional 

herpetofaunal assemblages.

4.3 – Methods 

 
4.3.1 – Study Area 

This study was conducted in three different areas (Fig. 4.1): Parque Estadual do 

Cantão (PEC), a strictly protected area; Área de Proteção Ambiental do 

Bananal/Cantão (APABC), a sustainable use protected area; and Fazenda Santa Fé 

(FSF), a private area. Climate in the region is tropical, with a rainy season from 

October to April and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2009).

sampling area (left), showing sampled locations (by any sampling methods) and major rivers. 

Sampled locations depicted by black and white circles. Federal units: MT – Mato Grosso; PA – 

Pará; TO – Tocantins. Conservation areas: APABC – Área de Protecção Ambiental da Ilha do 

Bananal/Cantão; FSF – Fazenda Santa Fé; PEC – Parque Estadual do Cantão. 

PEC is a state park with 90,000 ha, located within the municipality of Pium, in 

west Tocantins state, at the border with Pará state. It is a strict conservation unit 

corresponding to World Conservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon, 



 
 
 
Chapter 4 

70 
 

2005). The park is located in the alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its 

tributaries (Coco and Javaés). It is bordered by the Araguaia River in the east, by the 

Coco River in the west, and by the Javaés River in the south. The park is primarily 

covered by seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and to a lesser extent by non-flooded 

forests. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be more 

than six kilometers long. 

APABC is a 1,678,000 ha buffer area, at the eastern border of PEC, created to 

buffer the impacts over PEC and PNA. This conservation area comprises nine 

municipalities from the state of Tocantins. Our work was developed within the area of 

the three municipalities closer to PEC: Caseara, Marianópolis, and Pium. APABC is a 

sustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category V (Rylands &amp;amp; 

Brandon 2005). APABC presents greater habitat heterogeneity, including seasonally 

flooded and non-flooded grasslands with or without sparse trees, dry savannas, and 

deciduous gallery forests across the waterways. Because human activities are allowed 

within APABC, there are also roads, pastures, croplands, settlements, and villages. 

The buffer area is divided in zones for conservation, economical development, and 

special use. Because our interest was the area closer to PEC and the Araguaia River 

basin, we did not sample across all the extent of this area, but focused on conservation 

zones bordering PEC, and Coco and Javaés rivers. 

FSF is a private ranch, with 65,000 ha, located in the municipality of Santana do 

Araguaia, state of Pará, at the western margin of Araguaia River. The main activity is 

cattle ranching, but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by deciduous forest. The 

forested area is concentrated near the margin of the Araguaia River, in the continuity of 

APABC and PEC, following a longitudinal axis. These forests are drier than PEC and 

less influenced by seasonal flooding. 

Conservation areas were not sampled throughout its entire extent. Therefore, 

effectively sampled areas were determined by the method of the convex hull, including 

all sampling points in each sampling area. The effectively sampled areas were as 

follows: PEC – 77,270 ha; APABC – 87,304 ha; and FSF – 1,090 ha. 

 

4.3.2 – Data collection 
Field-data included in this study come from two different sources, separated by 

a temporal gap of one and a half year. The first dataset was the result of a sampling 

campaign performed by Guarino Colli and collaborators, during 2005. These authors 



 
 
 

On the Importance of Buffer Areas

sampled amphibians and squamates continuously during 47 days, from September 5 to 

October 22. Sampling was done in the following habitats within PEC and APABC: 

alluvial forests, dry deciduous forests, savannas, and grasslands. Sampling methods 

included arrays of pitfalls with drift-fences, funnel-traps, and active search. All collected 

individuals were deposited at Coleção Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília 

(CHUNB). Voucher specimens constitute a continuous series (CHUNB44914-46211) 

including 754 anurans and 532 squamates. Sampling date and geographical 

coordinates are available for all collected individuals. 

The second data set was the result of a sampling campaign done by E.F. and 

R.R., from June 2007 to November 2008, with a total number of 97 sampling days. This 

sampling included PEC, APABC, and FSF, widening the sampling area in the two first 

areas. We sampled amphibians and lizards in the several different habitats mentioned 

above. No directed effort was made for capturing snakes, contrary to the 2005 

campaign. Different areas were sampled in the two years. Each area was sampled 

consecutively during the end of the rainy season, dry season, and beginning of the 

rainy season, for equal periods. 

Sampling methods included arrays of pitfall traps with drift-fences, Sherman and 

Tomahawk traps, pipe-traps and active search. All methods were used in the three 

conservation areas at comparable proportions. However, sampling effort was greater in 

PEC and APABC than in FSF, and the number of captured individuals provides a fair 

idea of the differences of sampling effort across the three areas. Data on seven 

individuals (four lizards and three snakes) found dead on road in APABC were also 

included. 

The first captured individuals of each species, as well as individuals not 

identified in the field, were collected. The remaining individuals were marked with 

visible implant elastomer (VIE) and released. During this campaign, we captured 1844 

anurans and 406 lizards, including 158 anuran and 72 lizard voucher specimens, 

deposited at CHUNB (CHUNB58031–58260). All individuals were handled and/or killed 

ethically. 

All species considered in this study are documented by voucher specimen 

(CHUNB58103 – 58260) or, when not possible, by tissue samples (CHUNB58036 – 

58208; 59185 – 59239; 59580 – 59613). This was the case of one Tupinambis 
merianae and three T. quadrilineatus specimens, found dead on road, but not suitable 
for collection as voucher specimens. Exception was made for three snake species

(Anilius scytale, Caudisona durissa and Boa constrictor), for which we have no voucher 
or tissue, but only photographic record. Nomenclature for species and families follows 

lists available at the Brazilian Herpetology Society site, for amphibians (SBH, 2011a) 

and reptiles (SBH, 2011b). 

 

4.3.3 – Data Analysis 
Comparisons among the three areas were made using only amphibian and 

lizard taxa, because no special effort was made for capturing snakes or 

amphisbaenians in the 2007-08 campaign. Including these taxa in the analysis would 

surely constitute a source of bias. However, snakes and amphisbaenians were 

included in the total number of squamate species known from the middle Araguaia 

region. 

The two data sets were merged and individuals were pooled by area (PEC, 

APABC and FSF). Only the first capture of each individual released during the 2007/08 

campaigns was included in this analysis. Information on the number of captured 

individuals, microhabitat, conservation areas, and habitat characteristics of capture 

locations was compiled for each species. Characteristics of capture locations (within an 

aproximate 100m radius) were classified according to: (1) cover: closed (alluvial and 

gallery forests), mosaic (cerrado sensu strictu and cerradão), and open areas 
(grasslands and more open Cerrado formations); (2) flooding regime: seasonally 

flooded and non-flooded; (3) signs of anthropogenic disturbance: dirt roads, asphalt 

roads, and buildings; and (4) presence of permanent water bodies: rivers, lakes, and 

ponds. For each species, habitat characteristic classes were only considered when the 

number of individuals captured in that given class was greater than 5% of total number 

of captured individuals of that species. Information about the typical biomes of 

occurrence (Amazonia or Cerrado) was collected from the literature (Table 1). 

Information about sampling date and site of capture was available for all 

individuals, and it was possible to sort them by chronological order of capture, for each 

of the conservation areas and for the total set of individuals captured in the region. 

Amphibians and lizards were then divided in groups of 40 and 20 individuals, 

respectively, and subsequent analyses were preformed based on the chronologically 

arranged groups of individuals. Individual-based rarefaction curves (sensu Gotelli and 
Colwell, 2001), or Coleman curves, were generated separately for anurans and lizards, 

using the software EstimateS 8.2.0 for Mac (Colwell, 2006). Abundance based richness

Shannon’s H diversity index (Magurran, 2004) were estimated using the same 

software, for each point of the rarefaction curves. Buzas and Gibson’s E eveness index 

(Buzas and Gibson’s, 1969), was estimated according to Hayek &amp;amp; Buzas (1997) using 

the following equation:

4.4 – Results 

Considering the two data sets, 3539 individuals were captured in the study 

area: 2598 anurans, 857 lizards, 81 snakes, and 3 amphisbaenians. Anurans were 

represented by seven families and 38 species, and lizards by nine families and 20 

species (Table 4.1). Snakes comprised seven families and 25 species, and 

amphisbaenians one family and two species (Table 4.2). Among anurans, 22 species 

occur in Cerrado, three in Amazonia and nine in both biomes. Among lizards, 12 occur 

in Cerrado, one in Amazonia and seven in both biomes. Ten anuran species and ten 

lizard species only occurred in habitats not subjected to seasonal floods. On the other 

hand, no lizard species and only five anurans were only found in or near seasonally 

flooded habitats. Relatively to vegetation cover, five lizards, but no anuran species, 

were found only in closed forest formations. On the other hand, 15 anuran and six 

lizards were only found in open or mosaic formations. A higher number of anuran 

species was found most frequently on open/mosaic formations (26) than in close 

formations (12). However, roughly the same number of lizard species was found more 

frequently in open/mosaic formations (9) and in closed formations (11).

Individual-based rarefaction curves appear to approach an asymptote in all 

cases, except for lizard in FSF (Figure 4.2). The rarefaction curves stabilized at higher 

values of species richness in APABC than in PECC and FSF, both for anurans and 

lizards. This result holds true even considering the same numbers of individuals. 

Rarefaction curves based on the total number of individuals in the study area also 

present asymptotic behavior.

presented for each of the three sampled areas (A and C) and for the middle Araguaia region (B

Species richness estimates were also higher in APABC than in PEC (Figure 

4.3), both for lizards and anurans, and for the two estimators (ACE and Chao1). Due to 

the low number of captured individuals in FSF, the evolution of the richness estimators 

for this area was always very erratic, preventing comparisons with the other two areas. 

Anurans species richness estimators appear to converge to a stable estimate, with 

standard deviation (in the case of ACE) and 95% confidence intervals (in the case of 

Chao 1) steadily decreasing towards the end of the curves. On the other hand, for 

lizards, standard deviation (ACE) and confidence intervals remain broad even after 

adding all the individuals. It is important to mention that for ACE, standard deviation is 

based on the variation in sample order among randomizations and, without sample 

replacement, it must reach zero after adding the last set of individuals.

Eveness of the anuran assemblage was higher in APABC than in PEC and FSF 

(Figure 4.4). On the other hand, the lizard assemblage in PEC was more even than in 

APABC. Once again, the low number of captured individuals in FSF did not allow 

comparisons with this area. Evenness of the anuran assemblage considering all 

individuals was lower than in PEC and APABC considered separately, but the opposite 

result was obtained for lizards.

4.5 – Discussion 
 

4.5.1 – Species richness in the conservation areas: spatial heterogeneity and refuge 
theories 

Our results revealed that anuran and lizard species richness are significantly 

higher in APABC than in PEC. As previously mentioned, APABC is a more 

heterogeneous area, that includes several open and mosaic Cerrado formations, 

besides the gallery and alluvial forests that dominate PEC. Most anuran species found 

in the study area were only or mostly found in open areas (both non-flooded and 

seasonally flooded) and mosaic cerrado formations. In this regard, lizard species were 

more evenly distributed between closed and open habitats. However, because APABC 

included all habitats, species richness was still higher there. These results are in 

agreement with the findings of Nogueira et al. (2005, 2009), in that lizard fauna from 

Cerrado was more diverse in the interfluvial areas than in gallery forests, contrarily to 

earlier findings for bird and mammal assemblages (Redford &amp;amp; Fonseca, 1986; Silva, 

1997; Silva and Bates 2002). 

The higher herpetofauna species richness found in the more heterogeneous 

APABC corroborates the theory of spatial heterogeneity (Pianka, 1966). The diversity 

of habitats in this area, in opposition to the dominance of alluvial and gallery forests in 



 
 
 

On the Importance of Buffer Areas 

81 
 

PEC, must have contributed to the higher species richness in APABC. The abundance 

of key structures (Tews et al., 2004) in the latter area, such as termite mounds, 

enabled the presence of specialist species like Gymnodactylus carvalhoi (Vitt et al., 
2006). Other species, like Amphisbaena cf. meringoera and M. maximiliani, were also 
only or most frequently found in termite mounds, in APABC. 

Recent studies with medium and large mammals also reported higher species 

richness in non-flooded areas (Haugaseen &amp;amp; Peres, 2007; Negrões et al., 2011), which 

suggests that flooding regime, which is stronger in PEC, could also be limiting species 

richness inside the park. Differences in species richness between PEC and APABC 

were higher in the case of amphibians. Curiously, the five species restricted to flooded 

areas occurred in APABC but not in PEC. On the other hand, from the 19 species 

restricted to APABC, 12 occurred in flooded areas or present aquatic microhabitat. In 

the case of lizards, five species are restricted to APABC and to non-flooded habitats. 

However, all five species are typical of Cerrado biome and characteristic of more open 

formations. We therefore conclude that spatial heterogeneity must play a more 

important role in the partitioning of the herpetofauna assemblage, than flooding regime. 

No support was found for the role of the middle Araguaia basin as a refuge for 

forest lizard or amphibian species. This theory was proposed by Silva (1997) for birds. 

In the case of herpetofauna, only five species were confined to forested areas, and 23 

species were more frequent in forested areas. On the other hand, 21 species were 

restricted to the mosaic and open formations and 35 species were more frequent there. 

Species richness was also much lower in the alluvial and gallery forests of PEC, where 

only 18 anuran and 12 lizard species were found, against 38 anuran and 19 lizard 

species in APABC. If the Araguaia basin had been a refuge for forest species, we 

would expect a higher proportion of species in the gallery and alluvial forests of PEC. 

Also, it would be expected that endemic species associated with forest areas would be 

present. According to Silva (1997), in putative pleistocene refuges for forest species, 

we would predict the existence of recently formed endemic species associated with 

forest habitats. Two lizard (Tupinambis quadrileneatus and Micrablepharus atticolus) 
and four anuran species (Elachistocleis ovalis, Leptodactylus martinezi, L. syphax and 
Rhinella ocellata) found in the study area are endemic of Cerrado (Colli et al., 2002; 
Bastos, 2007). From these species, only M. aticollus was more frequent in forest 
habitat, but also occurred in more open formations. We therefore conclude that, 

because higher proportions of species richness and endemism are related to more 



 
 
 
Chapter 4 

82 
 

open formations, it is unlikely that this region has been a refuge for forest anuran and 

lizard species during the Pleistocene.  
 

4.5.2 – Species richness in the middle Araguaia: Amazonia and Cerrado contributions 
Most of the species (22 anurans and 12 lizards) found in this study, in the 

middle Araguaia basin, are strictly associated with the Cerrado biome. Only one lizard 

(Anolis ortonii), and three anurans (Leptodactylus leptodactyloides, Osteocephalus 
taurinus and Pipa pipa) are strictly associated with the Amazonian biome. One of this 
species, A. ortonii, was only found once, in FSF, at the western border of the Araguaia 
River. Despite the much larger sampling effort in APABC and PEC, this species was 

not found on the eastern bank of the Araguaia River. Eventually, a larger sampling 

effort in FSF might reveal the presence of more Amazonian species on the western 

bank of the river. The presence of more species in FSF is suggested by the mean 

values and dispersion measures of the estimates of species richness obtained with 

both estimators (ACE and Chao1), which are above the observed species richness. 

Species richness estimates for the middle Araguaia River were within the range 

of the values estimated for other Amazonian and Cerrado localities. Anuran richness 

estimates for the middle Araguaia River (38) were within the values reported for 

Cerrado localities (Vitt et al., 2002 – 24 spp.; Bastos, 2007 – 27-43 spp.) but lower than 

the values reported for Amazonian localities (Lima et al., 2006 – 50spp.; Bastos, 2007 

– 39-125 spp.; Bernarde, 2007 – 47spp.). Lizard richness estimates for this area (21) 

were also within the range of values reported for Cerrado (Colli et al., 2002 – 14-25 

spp.; Vitt et al., 2002 – 18spp.; Nogueira et al., 2005 – 17spp.; Nogueira et al., 2009 – 

13-28 spp.) and Amazonian localities (Colli et al., 2002 – 16-30 spp.; Vitt et al., 2008 – 

32 spp.). 

These results suggest that the ecotonal confluence between Amazonia and 

Cerrado, in this region, is not characterized by an increase in species richness, 

relatively to the merging biomes. Thus, these findings do not corroborate the idea that 

transitional areas bear greater diversity (Yahnen 1988; Risser, 1995). Instead, our 

results agree with the results of recent macro-scale approaches, which estimate lower 

values of squamate species richness at the edges of the Cerrado biome (Costa et al., 

2007). However, more sampling is needed in the western margin of the Araguaia River 

(FSF), where more species characteristic of the Amazonian biome might still be found, 



 
 
 

On the Importance of Buffer Areas 

83 
 

as suggested by the rarefaction curves and species richness estimators, as well as by 

the presence of Anolis ortonii in the area. 
Species richness estimates based on macro-scale approaches are available 

both for anurans and squamates. Based on available data sampled in several Cerrado 

localities, Diniz-Filho et al. (2006, 2007) extrapolated anuran species richness for the 

entire biome. These estimates predicted a maximum of 42 species for the region of the 

Bananal Island, and of 32 species for region where PEC and APABC lie. Our results, 

based on field data, confirmed the presence of at least 38 anuran species. The species 

richness of this area exceeded by six species the previous estimates, which 

corresponds to an increase of about 19% relatively to the 32 species previously 

estimated. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the rarefaction curves and on the 

species richness estimates for the total study area, the observed number of anuran 

species already matched the theoretical maximum to the area. On the other hand, we 

could not assign three anuran taxa to the species level, which might suggest that, as 

predicted by Bini et al. (2006), there are still some species to be described in this 

region. The number of endemic anuran species found in PEC and APABC reached (3 

sp.) or even slightly exceeded (4 sp.) the one estimated by Diniz-Filho (2007), 

depending on which species are considered to be Cerrado endemics (Colli et al., 2002; 

Bastos, 2007). 

A recent study regarding squamate richness in Cerrado, the area of the middle 

Araguaia, including Bananal Island, PEC, and APABC estimated a maximum of 30 

squamate species (Costa et al 2007). If we count all lizard, snake, and amphisbaenian 

species known to occur in this area, the observed squamate richness reaches 48 

species. However, contrary to the anuran assemblage, at least one new lizard species 

is predicted by both species richness estimators, and the upper bound of the 95% 

confidence interval of Chao 1 estimate reaches 34 species. In fact, during the second 

field campaign, new squamate species were still being recorded. Some of these 

species, such as Micrablepharus atticolus (small-size and habitat specialist) and 
Amphisbaena cf meringoera (small-size and fossorial) are more difficult to sample. 
However, large species such as Tupinambis quadrilineatus, T. merianae, Boa 
constrictor and Amphisbaena alba were only recorded during the second half of the 
second campaign, found dead in a road within APABC. These results suggest that it is 

possible that more lizard species can still be recorded in the region and that, even after 

intense sampling, a complete species list might not yet be a reality.

4.5.3 – Conservation implications 
As mentioned at the beginning of this manuscript, Cerrado and Amazonia 

biomes face severe threats to their integrity (Azevedo-Ramos &amp;amp; Galatti 2002; Klink &amp;amp; 

Moreira 2002; Silva &amp;amp; Rylands 2005; Fearnside 2005; Carvalho et al 2009). Agriculture 

and pastures have supplanted Cerrado and, most recently, the transitional areas 

between Cerrado and Amazonian forests (Sousa &amp;amp; Reid 2005). Deforestation can have 

a direct negative effect on major rivers (Latrubesse et al. 2009) and Brazilian 

government has development projects for two of them, Araguaia and Xingu (Sousa &amp;amp; 

Reid 2005). A large effort has been made in Brazil for the establishment of protected 

areas (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon 2005), but still a very small part of both biomes is under 

legal protection (Silva 2005; Klink &amp;amp; Machado 2005). The long-term persistence of 

Amazonian and Cerrado biotas depends not only on strictly protected areas but also on 

sustainable use reserves (Peres 2004). Successful cases of integration of sustainable 

use reserves and indigenous lands in large extents of pristine areas exist (Campos &amp;amp; 

Nepstad 2006). Efforts towards such an integration of conservation areas with different 

statuses are being conducted for the middle Araguaia basin. However, the area is 

under strong human pressure and tension frequently arises. During the writing of this 

manuscript, 10% of the area of PNA burned, threatening once again the integrity of 

regional conservation areas. 

Our data suggest that a significant part of herpetofauna diversity of the middle 

Araguaia exists outside strictly protected areas (PEC) and that surrounding areas, such 

as buffer areas (APABC) and private reserves (FSF) play an important role in the 

preservation of the herpetofauna of this region. This study focused only on three 

conservation areas but, nevertheless, we consider that the data here presented 

corroborate the importance of long-term collection of field data as the basis for efficient 

conservation strategies. Moreover, this is a good example of the major importance of 

environmental buffer areas, not only in reducing impacts on other conservation units, 

but also in the effective conservation of the regional biota.

Riverine barriers and amphibians

5.1 – Abstract 

Several hypotheses have been raised, to explain the mechanisms that shaped 

Amazonian biodiversity. The oldest is the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis, postulated by 

Alfred Russel Wallace, in 1852. This hypothesis resulted from the observation that large 

rivers were very frequent in the region and they dissect the Amazonian Rainforest in 

fragments of variable size. Recently, several studies using amphibian species distribution 

or molecular data have contributed to corroborate or refute this hypothesis. However, 

none of these studies focused on the clear-water rivers that flow from the Brazilian Shield 

and run towards the Amazonian biome. Here we tested the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis in 

the Araguaia River, the largest basin draining the Cerrado biome. For this purpose, we 

collected molecular data from three amphibian species (Elachistocleis ovalis, 
Leptodactylus latrans and Trachycephalus venulosus), using the gene coding for the 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1). Our results do not support the Riverine Barrier 
Hypothesis, since we did not found reciprocally monophyletic (or even paraphyletic) 

clades on both banks of the river. Rather, we found that haplotypes were shared between 

both banks of the Araguaia River, for the three species. Elachistocleis ovalis presented 
greater genetic diversity and structure than L. latrans and T. venulosus, and two strongly 
divergent lineages were found for the former species. The geographic dispersal of these 

two clades could support the role of Araguaia as of a semi-permeable barrier. We found 

no correlation between genetic structure and colour pattern variation, which might suggest 

the existence of two sympatric cryptic species. The existence of these two sympatric 

clades is discussed in the light of recent taxonomic changes within genus Elachistocleis. 
Additionally, the existence of two colour morphs in T. venulosus, consistent with the 
zonata and bufonia patterns described by Lutz in 1973, is reported for individuals sharing 
the same cox1 haplotype.

5.2 – Introduction 
Amazonian biodiversity has been puzzling naturalists for centuries and several 

hypotheses were raised in order to identify the mechanisms that shaped this amazing 

diversity (reviews by Haffer, 1997; Zeisset &amp;amp; Beebee, 2008; Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 



 
 
 
Chapter 5 

94 
 

2010). The first of these hypotheses was the “Riverine Barrier Hypothesis”, proposed in 

1852 by Alfred Russell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). The idea that rivers could have shaped 

Amazonian biodiversity resulted from the observation that: large rivers are common in the 

Neotropics, since the Pleistocene; and they dissect the tropical forest in fragments of 

various sizes and different species occur on opposite banks (Gascon et al., 1998). 

Support for this theory came for example from the study by Ron (2000), using 

distribution data of amphibians and other vertebrate groups in Neotropical lowlands. Funk 

and collaborators (2007) tested two biogeographic hypothesis using Engystomops 
(formerly Physalaemus) petersi, and their results provided some additional support for the 
Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. Noonan and Wray (2006) also suggested that phylogenetic 

relationships within populations of Dendrobates ventrimaculatus in Napo region might be 
in agreement this hypothesis. Further support came from studies with amphibians in 

Chagres River, in Central America (Lampert et al., 2003), and Yalong and Dadu Rivers, in 

China (Li et al., 2009). However, evidence against the role of rivers as barriers to 

amphibian species came from several studies performed in Amazonian rivers (Gascon et 

al., 1998; Lougheed et al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; Symula et al, 2003) and, curiously, 

also in rivers Yalong and Dadu (Zhao et al., 2009). 

According to some authors (Haffer, 1997; Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset &amp;amp; 

Beebee, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010), no single model can adequately explain Amazonian 

diversity. In fact, whether or not rivers can act as barriers seems to depend both on the 

river and on the species being study. The Riverine Barrier Hypothesis has been tested for 

amphibians in several Amazonian rivers, but not for the older clear-water rivers that flow 

from the Brazilian Shield (Gascon et al, 2000). One of these rivers, Tapajós, was studied 

by Bates and collaborators (2004), which found evidence of river-mediated genetic 

structure in populations of several bird species in Tapajós headwaters. 

Here we tested whether or not the Araguaia River, which borders the southeastern 

limits of Amazonia, acts as a barrier to gene flow in amphibian species. The Araguaia 

River is the main fluvial system in Cerrado and, together with Tocantins River, constitutes 

the fourth largest drainage basin of South America (Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., 

2009). Despite draining mostly within the Cerrado biome, Araguaia borders Amazonian 

rainforest throughout most of its lower course. Therefore, we considered Araguaia to be a 

suitable candidate for testing the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. 

Genealogical data indicate that, in addition to historical biogeographical events, 

behaviour and natural history of species can also impact phylogeographic patterns (Avise, 



 
 
 

Riverine barriers and amphibians 

95 
 

2009). Comparative phylogeographic studies enable the distinction between historical 

events, which may have influenced whole communities, from ecological or demographic 

forces acting on single lineages or species (Carnaval, 2002; Crawford et al., 2007). For 

this reason, we propose to test the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis using three amphibian 

species with wide distribution in the Neotropical region, and with different life-history and 

ecology: the microhylid Elachistocleis ovalis, the leptodactylid Leptodactylus latrans and 
the hylid Trachycephalus venulosus. 

Elachistocleis ovalis is a leaf-litter species, presenting the borrowing habits shared 
by many microhylid species (Wells, 2007). This species reproduces after heavy rains, 

during the rain season in more seasonal areas such as Cerrado (Rodrigues et al., 2003; 

Prado et al, 2005; Bernarde, 2007), or throughout the whole year, in the less seasonal 

central Amazonia (Lima et al., 2006). Leptodactylus latrans is the current valid name for 
the species formarly known as L. ocellatus (Lavilla et al., 2010a). This species is 
considered to be an early stage in the trend towards terrestrial habit observed in 

Leptodactylus (Heyer, 1969). This species is an explosive breeder that reproduces 
occasionally, during the dry season (Prado et al, 2005; Wells, 2007), placing the eggs in 

foam-nests above water surface (Heyer, 1969). Trachycephalus venulosus is a canopy-
dwelling species (Wells, 2007) that is able to glide for several meters in the horizontal 

(Duellman &amp;amp; Trueb, 1994). This species is considered an explosive breeder, which 

reproduces after heavy rains (Prado et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2005; Bernarde, 2007). 

We expect to find greater genetic structure and diversity, and a stronger influence of 

Araguaia on this structure in the case of E. ovalis, rather than in the more vagile L. latrans 
and T. venulosus. 

By analyzing the genetic structure of these three species around the mid-course of 

the Araguaia River, we hope to understand if this river constitutes a barrier to gene flow 

across different groups of amphibians, at a local scale. In the end, we aim to understand if 

our results help to corroborate or refute the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis of the 

diversification of Amazonian fauna. 

 

5.3 – Methods 

 

5.3.1 – Study area 
This study was conducted in the region of the mid-Araguaia River, in an area 

comprising four different conservation units (Figure 5.1), with different conservation 



 
 
 
Chapter 5 

96 
 

statuses: Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC); Área de Protecção Ambiental do 

Bananal/Cantão (APABC); Fazenda Santa Fé (FSF) and Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV). The 

regional climate is tropical and markedly seasnal, with a rain season from October to April 

and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010).

PEC is a state park with 90,000ha, in the west of the state of Tocantins, at the 

border with the state of Pará. It is a strict conservation unit corresponding to World 

Conservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon, 2005). The park is located in 

the alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its tributaries, Coco and Javaés. The 

park is mostly composed of seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and non-flooded forests at 

a lesser extent. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be 

more than six kilometres long. APABC is a 1,700,000ha buffer area, at the eastern border 

of PEC, created to buffer the impacts over PEC and Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), 

at the south. APABC is a sustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category 

V (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon 2005). FSF is a private ranch with 65,000ha, located in the 

municipality of Santana do Araguaia, state of Pará, at the western margin of Araguaia 

River. The main activity is cattle ranching but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by 

deciduous forest. The forested area is concentrated near the margin of the Araguaia 

River, in the continuity of APABC and PEC. These forests are drier than PEC and less 

influenced by seasonal flooding. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch managed for irrigated 

crop production (rice, maize, bean and soybean), with almost 70% of the area constituted 

by pristine Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies. Natural forest fragments, locally named 

ipucas, occur within agricultural and Cerrado matrices. 
 

5.3.2 – Sample collection 
Sampling was carried out between June 2007 and November 2008, using pitfalls, 

PVC pipetraps and active search. Detailed descriptions of sampling strategy can be found 

in Ferreira et al. (submitted, Chapter II and III of this thesis). The first individuals of each 

species were collected, prepared as voucher specimens and are deposited at “Coleção 

Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília” (CHUNB). All other individuals were 

individually marked with visible implant elastomer (VE) and released. Blood samples were 

collected directly from adult individuals into FTA® cards (Whatman™). Blood was 

collected after punching the forearm with a small lancet. Individuals were kept under 

observation and released in the following morning. We observed no mortality resulting 

from blood collection procedure. Occasionally, tissue was collected from the thigh muscle 

of individuals found dead inside pitfalls, but that were no longer suitable for voucher 

preparation.

5.3.3 – Laboratory protocols 
DNA was extracted from tissue samples preserved in FTA cards or ethanol using 

the salt-extraction method (Bruford et al. 1992) and the concentration of DNA isolates was 

quantified using spectophotometer (model NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV/Vis, Thermo Fisher 

Scientific). A 663-bp fragment of the gene coding for the subunit I of the cytochrome 

oxidade (cox1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers dgLCO1490 
and dgHCO2198 (Meyers, 2003). Amplification reactions were performed using the 

following PCR profile: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; 37 cycles with denaturation at 

95 °C for 40 s, annealing at 48 °C for 40 s and polymerization at 72°C for 60 s; final 

extension at 72°C for 5 min. In order to amplify particular samples, small adjustments to 

this profile were sometimes needed. PCR reactions were performed in a 25µl total 

volume, using 1.0 unit of Taq-polymerase and final concentration of 0.12 µM of each 

primer and 0.25µg/µl of bovine serum albumin. Other reagents were added according to 

manufacturer’s instructions. Quantity of DNA template was aimed at 50-100ng, but 

successful amplification occurred with as little as 10ng. The 663-bp fragment was 

sequenced once for each primer, in an automated sequencer ABI 310 using the Big Dye 

Terminator Cycle Polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Applied BiosystemsTM, Foster City, 

California). 

 

5.3.4 – Data Analysis 
Sequences1 were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm implemented in MEGA 

version 4.1 (Kumar et al. 2008), and then checked and edited by eye. Alignments were 

performed on the consensus sequences generated for each individual, using the raw 

sequences from forward and reverse sequencing. 

Numbers of haplotypes, haplotype (h) and nucleotide (?) diversity indices were 

estimated for each species, using DNASP version 5.10.01 (Librado &amp;amp; Rozas, 2009) ), 

using the alignments of all sequences from the Araguaia basin. Lists of haplotypes were 

generated with the same software and subsequent analyses were conducted based in 

haplotypes rather than in individual sequences. To investigate whether or not river 

Araguaia acts as a barrier to gene flow in these three amphibian species, we generated 

phylogenetic trees using both distance-based and criterion-based algorithms, as well as 

haplotype median-joining networks. For each species, the same taxa were used as

outgroups (Table 5.1) in all analyses except MJ networks, which were calculated without 

outgroups. 

Neighbour-joining (NJ) trees (Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987) were inferred based on the 

genetic distances estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura, 1980), using 

MEGA software. Bootstrap-consensus tree was inferred based on 1000 replicates 

(Felsestein, 1985). 

Most-parsimonious (MP) trees were inferred using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford 1998) 

by heuristic search. Starting trees were generated by stepwise addition (Farris, 1970), 

using 1000 replicates and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm 

(Swofford and Sullivan, 2009). Bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus-tree was inferred 

based on 500 replicates. 

Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes was 

conducted using MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Hueselbeck, 2003). Prior best 

model of nucleotide substitution was chosen based on the scores of Akaike information 

criteria, estimated using MrModelTest version 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). The settings for the 

chosen model, generated by MrModelTest, were then incorporated into MrBayes’ input 

file. Settings for the Metropolis coupling behavior were kept at default values. Markov 

chains ran for 1 million generations and were sampled each 100th generation. We 

confirmed that chains had reach stationarity by inspecting the value of the standard 

deviation of split frequencies. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated after 

discarding 25% of the simulated generations as burn-in. NJ, MP and BI phylogenetic trees 
were visualized and edited using FigTree version 1.3.1 (Rambaut, 2009). 

Median-joining networks (MJ) were generated using the software NETWORK 

(Bandelt et al, 1999). Only polymorphic nucleotide sites were included in MJ analyses. 

Geographical location of haplotypes across the mid-Araguaia basin was superimposed to 

the MJ networks a posteriori, following the grayscale and hatched patterns from figure 1, 
for better visualization of geographical distribution of haplotypes. 

Average pairwise genetic divergence between and within groups of haplotypes 

was estimated using the Kimura 2-parameter method (Kimura, 1980) implemented in 

MEGA. Standard error estimates were obtained by bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). 

Confidence intervals (95% CI) of the average pairwise distances were estimated 

according to Hayek &amp;amp; Buzas (1997).

5.4 – Results 

We obtained DNA sequences corresponding to fragments (663bp) of the cox1 
gene from 72 Elachistocleis ovalis, 52 Leptodactylus latrans and 39 Trachycephalus 
venulosus individuals. Additional sequences were included in the phylogenetic analysis: 
Elachistocleis ovalis from Panamá – KRL1136 and KRL1137, with the following GenBank 
accession numbers: FJ766754 and FJ766753; Trachycephalus venulosus from the 
Atlantic Forest, Espírito Santo, Brazil – JFT473, JFT757, JFT955, provided by João F. 

Tonini. Sequences for outgroup taxa were generated in this study or downloaded from 

Genbank (Table 5.1).

Trachycephalus venulosus Hemiphractus fasciatus (FJ766707) – Hylidae

The alignment was unambiguous and the inferred sequence contained no stop codons. 

The estimated best prior evolution models for Bayesian inference were: GTR (Rodriguez 

et al. 1990) with gamma-distributed substitution rates for E. ovalis and T. venulosus; and 
HKY (Hasegawa et al, 1985) with gamma-distributed substitution rates for L. latrans. 
Numbers of haplotypes, and polymorphic and parsimony informative sites were higher  in  

E. ovalis, and lower in T. venulosus (Table 5.2). The latter also presented the lowest 
levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity. Elachistocleis ovalis presented the highest 
nucleotide diversity but haplotype diversity was slightly lower than in L. latrans. 

According to the results of phylogenetic analysis, E. ovalis population presents  
genetic structure, but this structure appears not to be related with Araguaia River (Figure 
5.2). Two different clades (named EAraguaia and WAraguaia) were evident in the area of 

the mid-Araguaia. Only the monophyly of WAraguaia was supported by BI, but both 

clades were supported by NJ and MP analysis, and were also evident in the MJ network. 

Samples from the western bank (FSF, state of Pará) were all clustered in only one of 

these clades (WAraguaia), but they were not monophyletic or even paraphyletic relatively

to the samples from the eastern bank (state of Tocantins), which were present in both 

clades. There was also haplotype sharing between the two banks of the Araguaia River, 

but once again only in one clade (WAraguaia). According to the results of MJ analysis, a 

minimum of 14 mutations separated the ancestral haplotypes from both clades, which 

were not sampled. The monophyly of the mid-Araguaia haplotypes relative to two 

haplotypes collected in Panamá was only supported by NJ analysis. The number of 

mutation steps separating these haplotypes (25) from the unsampled common ancestor of 

the three clades was almost two times the number of mutation steps separating both mid-

Araguaia clades (14). 

In Elachistocleis ovalis, the estimated evolutionary divergence (Table 5.3) was 
lower between the clades from the river Araguaia (3.5%) than among these and the clade 

from Panama (5.9 and 7.0%). However, only the Western Araguaia clade was significantly 

more divergent from the Panama clade. Indeed, the confidence intervals of the divergence 

estimate between both Araguaia clades overlapped with the confidence intervals of the 

divergence estimate for the pair Panama/Eastern Araguaia. The average distances 

between clades were always higher than the average distances within clades, which 

varied from 0.6% (WAraguaia and Panama clades) to 0.7% (EAraguaia clade). 

Leptodactylus latrans haplotypes presented no structure at all, in the region of the 
mid-Araguaia (Figure 5.3). Only external nodes received some support from NJ and MP 

phylogenetic analyses. BI only supported the monophyly of the ingroup relatively to other 

sympatric species of the same genus. Extensive polytomy was observed throughout the 

whole tree, and only some external clades presented associated moderately high levels of 

posterior probability that were, however, not significant. These findings were posteriorly 

corroborated by MP analysis, which retained three best trees (not shown) and also 

presented   extensive   polytomy.   Extensive   haplotype   sharing   occurred   among   all

locations, including FSF and FLV, in opposite banks of the Araguaia River and about 150 

Km apart (Figure 5.1). 

Trachycephalus venulosus also did not present genetic structure relatively to the 
Araguaia River (Figure 4). Besides the support for the monophyly of the ingroup, three 

other clades were supported by MP and NJ analyses. One clade (Atl. Forest), also 

supported by BI analysis, correspond to haplotypes sampled in the Atlantic forest, state of 

Espírito Santo (Southeastern Brazil), which were monophyletic relatively to the mid-

Araguaia haplotypes. However, the haplotypes from the mid-Araguaia were not 

reciprocally monophyletic relatively the Atlantic forest haplotypes. NJ and MP analyses 

supported the monophyly of a clade that comprises the majority of the haplotypes from 

our study area (Araguaia I). The posterior probability (BI) associated with this clade was 

also high, but not significant (&lt;0.95). Another clade (Araguaia II), composed by two 

haplotypes, was supported by NJ and MP analysis. However, the relationships among the 

three clades and between these and the ungrouped haplotypes were inconclusive. MP 

analysis retained ten best trees (not shown) and corroborated these results.  

Average pairwise divergence estimates for T.venulosus were lower than the 
estimates for E. ovalis, even for the divergence between the clades from River Araguaia 
(Table 5.4). One of the two clades from the River Araguaia appears to be genetically 

closer to the Atlantic forest clade. However, for this species, divergence estimates among 

clades were not significantly different from each other.

5.5 – Discussion 

Cox1 gene is considered to perform well in discriminating amphibian species 
(Vences et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008). It also presents low amino acid divergence but 

high rates of nucleotide substitution and appears not to recover incorrect branches 

(Mueller et al, 2006). However, some disagreement exists regarding the overlap of 

intraspecific and interspecific variation in cox1 (Vences et al., 2005; Rubinoff et al., 2006; 
Smith et al., 2008). The fast evolution rate of the cox1 and its apparent reliability to 
recover phylogenetic relationships were the reasons for choosing this genetic marker to 

test the Araguaia River as a barrier to gene-flow at the intraspecific level of three 

amphibian species. 

 Haplotype diversity was high for the three species, considering estimates for other 

amphibian taxa, using mtDNA genes (Lougheed et al, 1998; Vences et al., 2004; 

Makowsky et al., 2009; Zainudin et al, 2010).  Nucleotide diversity estimates obtained in 

this study were located within the range of estimates for other amphibian species 

(Lougheed et al, 1998; Austin et al., 2002; Vences et al., 2004; Funk et al., 2007; 

Makowsky et al., 2009; Zainudin et al., 2010). However, nucleotide diversity was much 

higher for E. ovalis than for the other two species. In the study on Pseudacris crucifer, by 
Austin and collaborators (2002), the highest levels of nucleotide diversity occurred in 

areas of secondary contact among two different lineages. In our study, E. ovalis was 
indeed the only species that appears to include two distinct lineages, supported by all 

analyses except by bayesian inference. 

 

5.5.1 – Is Araguaia River a barrier to gene flow? 
The general pattern revealed by phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks, 

generated for the three species studied here, shows no congruence between geography 

and genetic relationships. For all three species, several haplotypes (generally the most 

frequent ones) occur on both banks of the Araguaia River. As expected, diversity was 

higher in E. ovalis, even though haplotype diversity was slightly higher in L. latrans. In the 
latter species, haplotypes were more evenly distributed and the ratio between 

haplotypes/individuals (23/52) was higher than in E. ovalis (27/73). However, haplotypes 
in L. latrans were less divergent than in E. ovalis, which presented a greater proportion of 
parsimony informative sites and much higher nucleotide diversity. The level of structure 

was also higher in E. ovalis. Two distinct clades were detected, with haplotypes from the 
western bank restricted to one clade, and haplotypes sampled at the northern portion of 



 
 
 

Riverine barriers and amphibians

the eastern bank restricted to the other clade. But even for E. ovalis, it appears that 
Araguaia River does not constitute an effective barrier to gene flow, since haplotypes from 

the two riverbanks are present, and even shared, in one of the clades. 

Expectations from the riverine barrier hypothesis include: 1) occurrence of two 

reciprocally monophyletic clades on opposite banks of the river (Haffer, 1997; Lougheed 

et al., 1998; Patton et al., 2000; Funk et al, 2007); 2) occurrence of a paraphyletic clade 

on one bank of the river, resulting from the dispersal of a population established on the 

other bank of the river (Haffer, 1997; Patton et al., 2000); 3) or strong genetic structure 

between populations on opposite banks of the river and little structure between 

populations on the same bank (Gascon et al., 2000; Funk et al., 2007; Zhao et al, 2009). 

The phylogeographic relationships revealed by our analysis do not corroborate any of 

these expectations and thus, do not support the Riverine Barrier hypothesis. Our results 

corroborate previous findings for Amazonian rivers (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed et al., 

1999; Gascon et al., 2000). All three species were captured near the river margins or even 

in the large islands that occur throughout the river. Frequently, haplotypes found in the 

islands also occurred in mainland, at one or both banks of the Araguaia River. 

Previous authors hypothesized that gene-flow can occur when extensive portions 

of land are passively transferred from one bank to another in a river, each time a meander 

loop is cut off or a new river course is carved out within the floodplain (Haffer, 1997; 

Gascon et al, 1998). In this study, all species were found in the islands. It is known that 

separation and accretion of islands to the mainland occurs in the Araguaia, and that larger 

islands are stable in a decadal scale (Latrubesse, 2009). Therefore, we consider that 

these islands can provide a mechanism of passive transfer of individuals from one bank of 

the river to another. 
 

5.5.2 – Two lineages of E. ovalis in the Araguaia River 
Our results support two distinct lineages of E.ovalis in the region of the mid-

Araguaia: one only at the eastern bank of the river and other mainly on the western bank. 

These lineages presented high divergence (3.5%) and their monophyly relatively to 

haplotypes of E. ovalis from Panama was not supported by MP and BI analyses. This 
result might be related to the fact that, despite the Western Araguaia Clade being 

significantly more divergent from the Panama Clade than from the Eastern Araguaia 

Clade, the magnitude of the divergence rates from the latter clade to the two former 

clades did not differ significantly.

The taxonomy of genus Elachistocleis is still unresolved (Toledo et al., 2010), 
despite recent attempts to clarify old controversies (Lavilla et al., 2003). Several species 

have been recently described or revalidated (Elachistocleis skotogaster – Lavilla et al., 
2003; E. cesarii – Toledo et al., 2010; E. magnus – Toledo, 2010; E. surumu, E. 
matogrosso, E. helianneae, E. carvalhoi and E. bumbameuboi – Caramaschi, 2010), 
adding to five previously known species. Species in this genus are mainly diagnosed by 

their colour patterns and the presence of postcommisural glands (Lavilla et al., 2003). In 

the description of E.ovalis presented by Parker (1934), two colour varieties occur in 
Elachistocleis ovalis, which ultimately might prove to be different species. 

The individuals collected in the mid-Araguaia basin are in general agreement with 

the description provided by Parker (1934) and presented great colour pattern variation 

(Supporting information – Figures 5.S1a to 5.S1c): presence/absence of discrete light 

dorsal strip; broad/thin femoral stripe, always with inguinal spots; more or less profusely 

spotted belly (sometimes not spotted at all). We did not found any correlation among 

coloration patterns or between these patterns and the identified clades, or even 

haplotypes. We could not safely assign the individuals from the Araguaia to any of the 

recently described species, based on morphological characters. However, because the 

individuals from this area fitted the description by Parker (1934), we considered that 

assigning them to E. ovalis would be a conservative approach. In addition, the specimens 
we collected (CHUNB58168, CHUNB58177, CHUNB58165, CHUNB58180, 

CHUNB58185, CHUNB58150) were very similar to other specimens previously collected 

in the same area (CHUNB45831-45846), by Janalee Caldwell and collaborators, and 

deposited as Elachistocleis ovalis in the Colecção Herpetológica da Universidade de 
Brasília. We do not exclude that ultimately they might be assigned to one of the recently 

described Elachistocleis species, eventually when molecular data becomes available for 
comparison. 

According to Bickford and co-authors (2006), morphological change might not be 

correlated with species boundaries because cryptic species are differentiated by nonvisual 

mating signals and/or could be under selection that promotes morphological stasis. 

Amphibians do tend to exhibit conservative morphological evolution and the application of 

molecular and bioacustic tools are helping to reveal morphologically cryptic species 

(Bickford et al., 2006; Stuart, 2006). Many cryptic complexes are sympatric (Bickford et al, 

2006) but are not usually each other's closest relatives (Stuart, 2006). The existence of 

two considerably divergent lineages in the mid-Araguaia basin, that might not be each 



 
 
 

Riverine barriers and amphibians

other's sister group (not supported as sister clades by MP and BI analyses), suggests that 

these two lineages might be part of a cryptic species complex. Unravelling cryptic species 

complexes is very important since actual biological species in those complexes have more 

limited distributions than the complex itself, making each more prone to extinction (Köller 

et al., 2005; Bickford et al, 2006). 

The average pairwise divergence rate between both Araguaia clades (3.5%) is 

above the threshold for intraspecific variation (2%) and bellow the threshold for 

interspecific variation (4%) estimated by Smith and collaborators (2008) for Holoarctic 

amphibian species. Both average pairwise divergence rates between the Araguaia clades 

and the Panama clade are above the latter threshold (5.9% and 7.0%). However, taking 

into account the values of intraspecific variation (mean 5.4%, regularly 10-14%) estimated 

by Vences and collaborators (2005) for Mantellid frogs, all the divergence rates estimated 

for E. ovalis might be considered intraspecific variation. 
If the variation that we encountered in the mid-Araguaia basin prove to be 

intraspecific, it might be possible that in fact the Araguaia River might pose some 

resistance to gene flow, acting as a semi-permeable barrier that reduces but does not 

eliminate the probability of dispersal between geographic areas. Such kind of barrier (filter 

barrier, in the sense of Remington, 1968) was found by Crawford and collaborators (2007) 

in the region of Bocas del Toro, Costa Rica. This way, two different lineages could have 

evolved at both banks of Araguaia River, with the posterior occurrence of dispersal across 

the river, eventually by a mechanism of passive transfer mediated by the islands. 
 

5.5.3 – Considerations about the dorsal patterns in T. venulosus 
The taxonomy of the genus Trachycephalus has also received recent 

contributions. Faivovich et al., (2005) included genus Phrynoyas (and thus P. venulosa) 
into genus Trachycephalus. Three new species were described recently: Trachycephalus 
lepida (Pombal et al, 2003), Trachycephalus dibernardoi (Kwet &amp;amp; Solé, 2008) in the 
Atlantic Forest, and Trachycephalus mambaiensis (Cintra et al., 2009) in Cerrado. All the 
species in the genus are easily distinguishable from T. venulosus. However, Lavilla et al. 
(2010b) suggested that this species might in fact constitute a species complex. In the 

account by Lutz (1973), T. venulosus is described as presenting two distinct dorsal 
patterns: the uniform bufonia pattern, and the ornate zonata pattern, that vaguely 
resembles the dorsal pattern of Trachycephalus mesopheus, from the Atlantic Rainforest. 



 
 
 
Chapter 5

According to Lutz (1973), it was unlikely that both patterns were in fact two different 

species. 
These two patterns occur in sympatry in the mid-Araguaia basin. Our results 

indicate no genetic structure relative to dorsal pattern (Supporting information, Figure 

5.S2). In fact, the same cox1 haplotype is shared by individuals presenting both patterns 
(eg. Figure 5.S2, TvenH8). These findings corroborate the hypothesis that both patterns 

correspond to the same species. Most of the haplotypes from the mid-Araguaia form a 

monophyletic clade. However, the relationship between this clade with the other 

haplotypes from this region and those from the Atlantic Forest (which also present the 

zonata pattern) is unresolved. In the case of T. venulosus, it also appears that several 
different lineages occur in the Araguaia basin. However, in this case, the divergence rates 

are rather consistent with a scenario of intraspecific variation.

Genetic structure of three lizard populations 

123 
 

6.1 – Abstract 

Since the formulation of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis for explaining the 

diversification of the Amazonian fauna, several alternative models have been proposed. 

Evidence for and against this and alternative hypotheses have been generated based on 

the work of several authors. Here, we propose to assess the genetic structure of three 

lizard species along the mid-Araguaia River, the largest drainage basin of the Cerrado 

biome. These species, Anolis nitens brasiliensis, Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis 
teguixin, differ in ecological requirements and size and we expect them to respond 
differently to the presence of Araguaia River. Ultimately, we aim to understand if the 

genetic structure of these three species agrees with the predictions of the Riverine Barrier 

Hypothesis. We collected tissue samples of these species along the mid-course of the 

Araguaia. We analyzed two fragments of mitochondrial DNA, corresponding to the genes 

coding for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and to the NADH dehydrogenase 
subunit 4 (ND4). As expected, our results revealed a different scenario for each different 
species. T. teguixin revealed the lowest levels of diversity and genetic structure, followed 
by A. ameiva and A. n. brasiliensis. Haplotype sharing between the eastern and western 
bank occurred in T. teguixin and A. ameiva, but not in A. n. brasiliensis. For the latter 
species, haplotypes from the western bank formed a monophyletic clade that rendered the 

eastern bank paraphyletic. These results suggest that Araguaia is not a barrier for both 

teiid species, but might constitute a barrier for gene flow in A. n. brasiliensis. We suggest 
that these differences might be a result of the combined effect of habitat preferences, 

ecology and body size. Our results provide new information on how the genetic structure 

and diversity of sympatric but ecologically distinct species can respond differently to the 

same environmental constraints. Phylogeograhic relations within Tupinambis were also 
discussed, by combining our data with previously published ones. The populations of T. 
teguixin from the mid-Araguaia and Roraima formed a monophyletic clade, but the 
monophyly of T. teguixin (when including a population from Equador) relatively to T. 
quadrilineatus and T. longilineus was not supported by our analysis.

6.2 – Introduction 

The role of rivers as barriers to animal populations and, thus, as one of the 

mechanisms responsible for the diversification of the Amazonian fauna, was first 

suggested in a formal framework as the “Riverine Barrier Hypothesis”, in 1852, by Alfred 

Russell Wallace (Colwell, 2000). Some support for this hypothesis came from studies on 

the distribution of Neotropical vertebrate taxa (Ron, 2000) and on the phylogenetic 

structure of amphibians (Noonan and Wray, 2006; Funk et al, 2007), lizards (Pellegrino et 

al., 2005; Rodriguez-Robles et al., 2008), birds (Bates et al., 2004) and mamals (Patton et 

al, 2000; Rocha et al., 2011). However, the phylogenetic patterns revealed for several 

other species refuted the predictions of the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. Evidence against 

the dominant role of rivers in the diversification of Amazonian fauna came, sometimes, 

from the same studies (Patton el al, 2000; Noonan and Wray, 2006), but also from studies 

with other species (Gascon et al., 1998; Lougheed et al., 1999; Gascon et al., 2000; 

Symula et al., 2003). Several authors agree that no single model could adequately explain 

Amazonian diversity, and that different mechanisms should be relevant in speciation 

processes of different faunal groups (Noonan and Wray, 2006; Zeisset and Beebee, 2008; 

Haffer, 2008; Antonelli et al., 2010). 

Insights about the role of rivers in the genetic structure of lizard species came from 

a study by Glor and collaborators (2001), which found evidence of a very deep split 

between the subspecies of A. nitens at the north and at the south of the Amazon River. 
Evidence came also from studies in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (Pellegrino et al., 

2005) and in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico (Rodriguez-Robles et al., 2008). 

However, there are no published data, at least to our knowledge, on the genetic structure 

or phylogeography of lizard species along the several large rivers flowing from the 

Brazilian Shield. 

Here we propose to assess the potential role of one of these rivers, the Araguaia, 

as a barrier to the gene flow of lizard species. The Araguaia River is the main drainage 

basin of the Cerrado biome and, together with the Tocantins River, constitutes the fourth 

largest drainage basin of South America (Aquino et al., 2008; Latrubesse et al., 2009). 

The Araguaia basin has been recognized as a priority area for conservation (Azevedo-

Ramos and Galatti, 2002; Cavalcanti and Joly, 2002). 

The natural history of species can impact phylogeographic patterns (Avise, 2009), 

but comparative phylogeography might help to discriminate community-level historical 

events from ecological or demographic forces acting on single lineages or species 



 
 
 

Genetic structure of three lizard populations 

125 
 

(Carnaval, 2002; Crawford et al., 2007). For this reason, we chose to study three species 

that diverge in their evolutionary history, ecology and size: Anolis nitens brasiliensis, 
Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis teguixin. 

Anolis nitens is a polychrotid lizard with typical sit-and-wait predator behaviour 
(Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007). This species is divided in 

several recognized subspecies, which were proven to be genetically divergent (Ávila-

Pires, 1995; Glor et al., 2001). Anolis n. brasiliensis is widely distributed in the Cerrado 
biome (Colli et al., 2002; Vitt et al., 2008a), occurring also periferically in Amazonia (Ávila-

Pires, 1995), namely in the mid-Araguaia basin (Vitt et al., 2008a). Similarly to its 

Amazonian relatives (Ávila-Pires, 1995; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Vitt et al, 2001; Vitt et al., 

2008b), this subspecies is a forest specialist, non-heliothermic, being predominantly found 

in the leaf litter and in the basal portion of trunks within forested habitats (Mesquita et al, 

2006; Vitt et al., 2008a). This species is very rarely observed in open areas (Colli et al., 

2002; Vitt et al., 2008a). 

The teiids Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis teguixin are ground-dwelling active 
foragers (Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007). Both species are 

heliotherm (Vitt and Colli, 1994; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al, 2008b), and occur both on 

forested and open areas, preferentially in ecotones and naturally or antropogenically 

disturbed areas such as tree-falls, clearings or river bluffs (Vitt and Colli, 1994; Ávila-

Pires, 1995; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al. 2008a). At least T. teguixin is known to be a 
good swimmer, despite its terrestrial habit (Ávila-Pires, 1995; Vitt et al., 2008b). Ameiva 
ameiva is a medium-sized lizard with a wide-distribution that extends from Panama to the 
tropical South America (Peters and Donoso-Barros, 1986), reaching the north of 

Argentina, east of the Andes (Colli, 1991). Tupinambis teguixin is a large lizard, distributed 
throughout Amazonia and in the northern part of South-America east of Andes. Its 

distribution limits are extended southwards, in gallery forests, to the state of São Paulo  

(Ávila-Pires, 1995). 

With this study, we aim to assess the genetic structure of these ecologically 

distinct lizards, in the region of the mid-Araguaia river. We wish to understand if and how 

the Araguaia River interferes with the gene flow in these species and if, therefore, these 

findings would provide evidence for or against the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. We expect 

levels of structure and diversity to be higher in the sit-and-wait predator and forest 

specialist, A. n. brasiliensis, than in both the more active and less habitat-restricted teiid

species. At last, we expect that the much larger Tupinambis teguixin will reveal the lowest 
levels of genetic structure and diversity. 

 

 

6.3 – Methods 
 

6.3.1 – Study area 
This study was conducted in the region of the mid-Araguaia River, in an area 

comprising four different conservation units (Figure 6.1), with different conservation 

statuses: Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC); Área de Protecção Ambiental do 

Bananal/Cantão (APABC); Fazenda Santa Fé (FSF) and Fazenda Lago Verde (FLV). The 

regional climate is tropical and markedly seasonal, with a rain season from October to 

April and a dry season from May to September (INMET 2010). 

PEC is a state park with 90,000ha, in the west of the state of Tocantins, at the 

border with the state of Pará. It is a strict conservation unit corresponding to World 

Conservation Unit (IUCN) category II (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon, 2005). The park is located in 

the alluvial basin of the Araguaia River and two of its tributaries, Coco and Javaés. The 

park is mostly composed of seasonally flooded alluvial forests, and non-flooded forests at 

a lesser extent. PEC also includes some islands along the Araguaia River that can be 

more than six kilometres long. APABC is a 1,700,000ha buffer area, at the eastern border 

of PEC, created to buffer the impacts over PEC and Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA), 

at the south. APABC is a sustainable use protected area, corresponding to IUCN category 

V (Rylands &amp;amp; Brandon 2005). FSF is a private ranch with 65,000ha, located in the 

municipality of Santana do Araguaia, state of Pará, at the western bank of Araguaia River. 

The main activity is cattle ranching but about 65% of the ranch is still covered by 

deciduous forest. The forested area is concentrated near the Araguaia River, in the 

continuity of APABC and PEC. These forests are drier than PEC and less influenced by 

seasonal flooding. FLV is an 8,000ha private ranch managed for artificially irrigated crop 

production (rice, maize, bean and soybean), with almost 70% of the area constituted by 

pristine Cerrado sensu lato physiognomies. Natural forest fragments, locally named 

ipucas, occur within agricultural and Cerrado matrices.

6.3.2 –Sample collection 

Sampling was carried out between June 2007 and November 2008, using pitfalls, 

Sherman and Tomahawk traps and active search. Detailed descriptions of sampling 

strategy can be found in Ferreira et al. (submitted, Chapter II of this thesis) and Rocha et

al. (2011). The first individuals of each species were collected, prepared as voucher 

specimens and are deposited at “Coleção Herpetológica da Universidade de Brasília” 

(CHUNB). All other individuals were individually marked with visible implant elastomer 

(VE) and released. Blood samples were collected directly from adult individuals into FTA® 

cards (Whatman™). Blood was collected after punching between the lizard fingers with a 

small lancet. Individuals were kept under observation and released in the following 

morning. We observed no mortality resulting from blood collection procedure. 

Alternatively, tail tissue samples were collected whenever lizards released the tail-tip, 

during handling. Occasionally, tissue was collected from the thigh muscle of individuals 

found dead inside pitfalls, but that were no longer suitable for voucher preparation. 

 

6.3.3 – Laboratory protocols 
DNA was extracted from tissue samples preserved in FTA cards or ethanol using 

the salt-extraction method (Bruford et al. 1992) and the concentration of DNA isolates was 

quantified using spectophotometer (model NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV/Vis, Thermo Fisher 

Scientific). A 663-bp fragment of the gene coding for the subunit I of the cytochrome 

oxidade (cox1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers dgLCO1490 
and dgHCO2198 (Meyers, 2003). An initial 840 to 860-bp fragment of the gene coding for 

the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) was amplified using the primers ND4 and LEU 
(Arévalo et al. 1994). 

PCR reactions were performed in a 25µl total volume, using 1.0 unit of Taq-

polymerase and final concentration of 0.12µM (cox 1) or 0.16µM (ND4) of each primer and 
0.25µg/µl of bovine serum albumin. Other reagents were added according to 

manufacturer’s instructions. Quantity of DNA template was aimed at 50-100ng, but 

successful amplification occurred with as little as 10ng. 

Amplification of cox1 fragment was performed using the following PCR profile: 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; 37 cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 40 s, 

annealing at 48°C for 40 s and polymerization at 72°C for 60 s; final extension at 72°C for 

5 min. In order to amplify particular samples, small adjustments to this profile were 

sometimes needed. Amplification of ND4 fragment was performed using the following 
PCR profile: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min; 32 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 

30s, annealing at 54°C for 45s and polymerization at 72°C for 60 s; final extension at 72°C 

for 5 min. The fragments were sequenced once for each primer, in an automated

sequencer ABI 310 using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Polymerase (Perkin Elmer, 

Applied BiosystemsTM, Foster City, California). 

 

6.3.4 – Data Analysis 
Sequences2 were aligned using CLUSTALW algorithm implemented in MEGA 

version 4.1 (Kumar et al. 2008), and then checked and edited by eye. Alignments were 

performed on the consensus sequences generated for each individual, using the raw 

sequences from forward and reverse sequencing. 

Numbers of haplotypes, haplotype (h) and nucleotide (?) diversity indices were 

estimated for each species, for each gene in separate and for concatenated data, using 

DNASP version 5.10.01 (Librado &amp;amp; Rozas, 2009), using the alignments of all sequences 

from the Araguaia basin. Lists of haplotypes were generated with the same software and 

subsequent analyses were conducted based in haplotypes rather than in individual 

sequences. To investigate whether or not river Araguaia acts as a barrier to gene flow in 

these three amphibian species, we generated phylogenetic trees using both distance-

based and criterion-based algorithms, as well as haplotype median-joining networks. For 

each species, the same taxa were used as outgroups (Table 6.1) in all analyses except 

MJ networks, which were calculated without outgroups. 

Neighbour-joining (NJ) trees (Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987) were inferred based on the 

genetic distances estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter method (Kimura, 1980), using 

MEGA software. Bootstrap-consensus tree was inferred based on 1000 replicates 

(Felsestein, 1985). 

Most-parsimonious (MP) trees were inferred using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford 1998) 

by heuristic search. Starting trees were generated by stepwise addition (Farris, 1970), 

using 1000 replicates and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm 

(Swofford and Sullivan, 2009). Bootstrap 50% majority-rule consensus-tree was inferred 

based on 500 replicates. 

Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes was 

conducted using MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Hueselbeck, 2003). Prior best 

model of nucleotide substitution was chosen based on the scores of Akaike information 

criteria, estimated using MrModelTest version 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). The settings for the 

chosen model, generated by MrModelTest, were then incorporated into MrBayes’ input

submitted prior to manuscript submission.

file. Settings for the Metropolis coupling behavior were kept at default values. Markov 

chains ran for 1 million generations and sampled each 100th generation. We confirmed 

that chains had reach stationarity by inspecting the value of the standard deviation of split 

frequencies. A 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated after discarding 25% of 

the simulated generations as burn-in. NJ, MP and BI phylogenetic trees were visualized 
and edited using FigTree version 1.3.1 (Rambaut, 2009). Phylogenetic analysis was 

conducted for each gene in separate and for the the concatenated data. 

Median-joining networks (MJ) were generated using the software NETWORK 

(Bandelt et al, 1999). Only polymorphic nucleotide sites were included in MJ analyses. 

Geographical location of haplotypes across the mid-Araguaia basin was superimposed to 

the MJ networks a posteriori, following the grayscale and hatched patterns from figure 1, 
for better visualization of geographical distribution of haplotypes. 

Average pairwise genetic divergence between groups of haplotypes was estimated 

using the Kimura 2-parameter (K-2p) method (Kimura, 1980) implemented in MEGA. 

Divergence was estimated considering pairwise deletion of nucleotide sites and gamma 

distributed evolutionary rates. Standard error estimates were obtained by bootstrap 

procedure (1000 replicates). Confidence intervals (95% CI) of the average pairwise 

distances were estimated according to Hayek &amp;amp; Buzas (1997). 

 

 

6.4 – Results 

We obtained DNA sequences corresponding to fragments (663bp) of the cox1 
gene from 27 Anolis nitens brasiliensis and 69 Ameiva ameiva. Sequences from T. 
teguixin consistently presented too much ambiguity, despite the overall good quality of the 
signal, and were discarded from the analyses. We also obtained DNA sequences 

corresponding to fragments of the ND4 gene from 27 A. n. brasiliensis (860bp), 72 A. 
ameiva (840bp) and 67 T. teguixin (840bp). Several stop codons and gaps were found in 
the last portion of these sequences, which should correspond to the genes coding for a 

set of three t-RNA molecules (Arévalo, 1994). We choose to eliminate this segment and 

only the initial portion of the sequence (until the first stop codon) was used in the analysis. 

This resulted in a ND4 fragment of 696-bp for A. n. brasiliensis, and 684-bp for A. ameiva 
and T. teguixin. For the latter species, additional sequences were included in the 
phylogenetic analysis (supporting information, Table 6.S1). Sequences used as outgroup 

taxa were all generated in this study (Table 6.1).

The estimated best prior evolution model for Bayesian inference was the general 

time reversible (GTR – Rodriguez et al. 1990), for all species/gene combinations. 

Additionaly, shape parameter of gamma-distribution of substitution rates (GTR+G) was 

selected for: ND4 and for concatenate data, in A. ameiva and Tupinambis; and cox1 in A. 
n. brasiliensis. Proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I) was selected for: ND4 and 
concatenated data in A. n. brasiliensis; and cox1 in A. ameiva. 

Anolis n. brasiliensis presented higher diversity in cox1 than in ND4, but the 
opposite occurred in A. ameiva (Table 6.2). Anolis n. brasiliensis presented the highest 
nucleotide diversity, in all cases. The values for this species were about two (ND4) to 
almost five times higher (cox1) than in A. ameiva, and almost nine times higher (ND4) 
than in T. teguixin. The number of cox1 haplotypes, in A. n. brasiliensis, was two times 
greater than in A. ameiva. However, the number of haplotypes in A. ameiva was higher 
both for ND4 gene and for concatenated data. All diversity indices were fairly lower in T. 
teguixin than in the other two species. 

Globally, the results from phylogenetic analysis based on the two separated genes 

and on the concatenated data revealed very similar phylogenetic relationships. For this 

reason, only the results obtained from the concatenated data will be presented. When 

appropriate, disagreement among the results from the different data sets will be referred. 

Anolis nitens brasiliensis appears to be structured along the Araguia River, with no 
haplotypes shared between riverbanks or among different areas in the eastern bank 

(Figure 6.2). However, few haplotypes were shared by more than one individual. 

Maximum parsimony and Neighbour-joining analyses supported the monophyly of the 

haplotypes from the western bank. The Bayesian support was also high but not 

significant. These results were corroborated by the three methods in cox1 (0.98/97/97), 
but received low support in ND4 (0.87/68/72). A deeper divergence appears to exist

between the haplotypes from the Araguaia basin and those from FLV. The monophyly of 

the haplotypes from FLV received maximum support from all the analysis using the three 

data sets. The monophyly of the Araguaia haplotypes was supported by MP and NJ 

analyses, but not by BI. The exact same support values were obtained using all data sets. 

In the MJ network, is possible to observe the very high number (106) of mutation that 

separates the hypothetic common ancestor from FLV haplotypes (not sampled) from the 

closest haplotype sampled in the Araguaia. The divergence estimate between the two 

detected clades was 10.1% ± 2.0%.

A different situation occurs in A. ameiva, where haplotypes are shared between 
riverbanks and among different areas from the eastern Araguaia bank (Figure 6.3). The 

most frequent haplotype appears to be restricted to the eastern bank, but the second most 

frequent one is shared by both banks and by the river islands. The NJ tree presents

extensive politomy, with only one deep divergence between two clades: one (FLV) 

comprising only haplotypes sampled in FLV and another (Araguaia) including all the 

haplotypes from the Araguaia River and one haplotype found in FLV. The monophyly of 

the clade FLV received high support in all analyses, except in BI (0.89) using the ND4 
data set. The monophyly of the Araguaia clade also received high bootstrap support from 

MP and NJ, but BI was only obtained in the case of cox1. The estimated divergence (K-
2p) between the two clades was 3.3%±1.0%. Haplotypes sampled in the mid-Araguaia 

basin appear to radiate from a central and most frequent haplotype (AameH2), as 

depicted in MJ network. Clade FLV does not connect to the network through this central 

haplotype, but through a close one (AameH1), sampled at the southern area or PEC. The 

number of mutations (38) separating the haplotypes from clade FLV is several-fold larger 

than the number of mutations separating any other two haplotypes in the MJ network. 

In the case of T. teguixin the analysis was performed including sequences from 
this and other species of the genus Tupinambis, used in previous studies (Supporting 
Information, Table 6.S1), available at Genebank. Several of these sequences 

corresponded to smaller fragments (375-bp) of the ND4 gene. In order to use as much 
data as possible, analyses were performed using pairwise deletion of nucleotide sites 

when necessary. 

Phylogenetic analyses (Figure 6.4) confirmed the occurrence of three Tupinambis 
species in the study area: T. teguixin (TtegH1-H8), T. quadrilineatus (TquaH1) and T. 
merianae (TmerH1). The original data set from Fitzgerald et al (1999) did not include 
T.quadrilineatus. Here, the monophyly of this species is highly supported by the three 
methods, appearing as the sister species to T. longilineus. The monophyly of the 
haplotypes of T. teguixin from the Araguaia is supported by MP and NJ analyses,but not 
by BI. This clade is presented as the sister clade to T. teguixin from Roraima, Brazil, with 
high support from MP and NJ analyses. The monophyly of the three T. teguixin 
populations was only supported by MP analysis (83), but the monophyly of T. teguixin + T. 
longilineus + T. quadrilineatus is highly supported by the three methods of phylogenetic 
analysis. Divergence estimates (Table 6.3) were significantly lower than others involving 

the same clades, in the following cases: T. teguixin from the Araguaia and from Roraima 
(5.8%±2.5%); T. longilineus and T. quadrilineatus (6.6%±2.7%); T. merianae and T. 
rufescens/T. duseni (11.1%±3.7%). Tupinambis teguixin from Cuyabeno (Equador) was 
not significantly more divergent from T. longilineus (14.6%±4.7%) or T. quadrilineatus

(12.6%±4.1%) than from the other two T. teguixin populations (Araguaia, 11.1%±3.7%;

We found very little variation in the T. teguixin haplotypes from the Araguaia. Fifty-
one individuals shared the same haplotype (TtegH1), which corresponded to more than 

75% of the sampled individuals. This haplotype occurred with high frequency in both 

banks and in the Araguaia islands, suggesting lack of structure in the study area. The lack 

of structure is also patent in the NJ tree, where most of the nodes have no support from 

any of the analysis. All other haplotypes sampled more than once (TtegH2 and TtegH4) 

occurred in more than one area.  All haplotypes appear to radiate from the most abundant 

one. One haplotype (TtegH2) is separated from the nearest one by 9 mutations, being 

supported as sister to the remaining haplotypes by MP and NJ analyses.

6.5 – Discussion 

 
6.5.1 – Patterns of genetic structure 

Anolis nitens is a polychrotid lizard with typical sit-and-wait predator behaviour 
(Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007) and the teiids Ameiva ameiva 
and Tupinambis teguixin are ground dwelling and active foragers (Colli et al., 1997; Vitt 
and Zani, 1998; Miles et al., 2007). Besides these ecological differences, the three 

species also differ greatly in size, which was confirmed by the average size of individuals 

captured during this study (supporting information, Table S2). Average size for A. n. 
brasiliensis reported here is slightly lower than in the study by Vitt and collaborators 
(2008a), for the same area. Our smaller sample size, and the inclusion of sub-adult 

individuals in our case, was probably the main causes for this difference. Here, we chose 

to exclude all juveniles from the morphometric analysis but, because we did not evaluate 

the reproductive condition, some non-reproductive individuals were certainly included. 

Nevertheless, there is a large difference in size among the three species. Based on these 

differences, we would expect that A. n. brasiliensis presented a greater level of genetic 
structure and diversity. 

The lack of shared haplotypes between riverbanks and among different areas in A. 
n. brasiliensis, contrasting with the extensive haplotype sharing in both teiid species 
confirms our suspects. The fact that all T. teguixin haplotypes sampled in more than one 
individual were present in different geographic areas and the hegemony of a single and 

widely dispersed haplotype also suggests an absence of structure in this species. On the 

other hand, the support for two distinct and, at some extent, geographically separate 

clades in Ameiva ameiva, as well as the existence of some geographic segregation of less 
frequent (and not shared) haplotypes, indicates an higher level of structure in this species, 

comparatively to T. teguixin. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity were always higher in A. 
n. brasiliensis than in A. ameiva and T. teguixin. In this regard, genetic diversity was also 
higher in A. ameiva than in T. teguixin. As would be expected, there was a decreased 
level of structure and diversity with the increased vagility, which is a result of the 

combined effects of feeding ecology, habitat preferences and body size. 

Two strongly supported and widely divergent lineages were found in A. ameiva 
and A. n. brasiliensis, corresponding to a distinction between the haplotypes from the 
Araguaia and the haplotypes from FLV. These two areas are approximately 100 km apart, 

which is more than the 70 km that separate the northern and southern sampling locations

along the Araguaia. In the case of A. ameiva, haplotypes from both clades were sampled 

in FLV. Even though, the haplotype sampled in FLV that belongs to the Araguaia clade 

(AameH20) was not sampled along the Araguaia and was four mutations apart from the 

closest sampled haplotypes (AameH2 and AameH27). This contrasted with the maximum 

divergence of two mutations between any two closest haplotypes sampled in the 

Araguaia. Because of the very high divergence (K-2p = 3.3% ± 1%; 38 mutations) 

between both clades, and because one of the clades was only composed by haplotypes 

sampled in FLV, we believe that the two clades correspond to distinct and long diverged 

populations of A. ameiva and the presence of haplotype AameH20 in FLV is an evidence 

of recent migration from the Araguaia to Cerrado. FLV is located in an area dominated by 

Cerrado sensu latu physiognomies, with remnants of forested patches dominated by plant 

species belonging to the families Favaceae, Arecaceae, Chrysobalanaceae and 

Vochysiaceae (Martins et al. 2008). The mid-Araguaia basin is more densely vegetated, 

dominated by gallery and alluvial forests. Ameiva ameiva occurs both on forested and 
open areas, preferentially in ecotones and naturally or antropogenically disturbed areas 

such as tree-falls, clearings or river bluffs (Vitt and Colli, 1994; Ávila-Pires, 1995; Sartorius 

et al., 1999; Vitt et al. 2008a). For this reason, we did not found evidence for the existence 

of barriers to the dispersal of this species that could justify the divergence here found. 

Because individuals appear to be able to cross from one area to the other but clearly two 

different lineages are present in this region, one might suspect that this area can actually 

be a secondary contact area between two different lineages. We hypothesize that the 

population from the Araguaia might be closer related to Amazonian populations and the 

FLV to Cerrado populations. However, molecular samples from a broader area are 

needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis. 

Two very distinct lineages (10.1% ± 2.0%) were also found in the case of Anolis 
nitens brasiliensis. We were not able to collect vouchers from the two specimens captured 
in FLV. Both specimens were caught in pitfalls and had been attacked and partially eaten 

by ants. The only reliable sources of information were the measurements taken and the 

tissue sample that was collected and deposited at CHUNB. We could suspect that the two 

individuals belonged to another closely related species, Anolis meridionalis, which is 
typical from Cerrado biome (Colli et al., 2002; Nogueira et al, 2005; Langstroth, 2006), 

being most commonly found in grasslands, but never in densely forested areas (Nogueira 

et al., 2009). 



 
 
 
Chapter 6

However, several lines of evidence help us to refute this hypothesis. First, the 

measured snout-vent length of the two individuals (58.6 and 64.0mm) is consistent with A. 
n. brasiliensis (Ávila-Pires, 1995; Mesquita et al., 2006; Vitt et al., 2008) but not consistent 
with A. meridionalis (Gainsbury and Colli, 2003; Colli and Oliveira, 2011). Second, both 
individuals were captured inside the natural forested fragments and not in the Cerrado 

matrix and, as referred above, A. n. brasiliensis is a forest species and A. meridionalis is 
characteristic of open areas. Third, the two individuals were more divergent among each 

other (15 mutations), despite being captured about 2 Km apart from each other, than the 

two most divergent haplotypes from the eastern bank of the Araguaia (AnitH11 and 

AnitH13, 13 mutations), sampled about 28 km apart. The difference is that the two 

haplotypes from FLV were sampled in two forested remnants within a matrix of Cerrado 

and agricultural fields, while the Araguaia haplotypes were sampled in a continuous 

forested area. Forth, the average pairwise divergence between the FLV and the Araguaia 

clade (10.1% ± 2.0%) is perfectly consistent with intraspecific divergence values found 

between the Amazonian subspecies of A. nitens, or even within populations of the 
subspecies A. nitens tandai (Glor et al., 2001). Therefore, we have reason to suspect that 
the two clades might correspond to different subspecies of Anolis nitens, or two highly 
divergent populations within A. nitens. The subspecies A. n. brasiliensis, which occurs in 
Cerrado, was previously identified in our study area along Araguaia and Coco rivers (Vitt 

et al., 2008). The other known subspecies of A. nitens occur in the Amazonia. Whether 
the individuals from FLV are a different subspecies or are related to Amazonian 

subspecies is dependent on including molecular data from the other subspecies in these 

phylogenetic analyses. If individuals captured in FLV are more related with Amazonian A. 

nitens, it will provide evidence for an ancient relationship between the forested remnants, 

ipucas, and Amazonian rainforest. 
 

6.5.2 – Is Araguaia River a barrier for lizard species? 
The frequent occurrence of the same haplotypes on both banks of the Araguaia 

river, in A. ameiva and T. teguixin is enough to refute the hypothesis that this river might 
have a strogn effect in limiting the gene flow in this species. Both species are abundant in 

the Araguaia islands and haplotypes shared between banks are often also found in the 

islands. On this regard, it is important to refer that previous authors hypothesized that 

gene-flow could occur when extensive portions of land are passively transferred from one 

bank to another in a river, each time a meander loop is cut off or a new river course is

carved out within the floodplain (Haffer, 1997; Gascon et al, 1998). This is known to occur 

in the Araguaia, where some large islands are stable for as long as a decade (Latrubesse, 

2009). 

Another indirect source of evidence comes from the support for the monophyly of 

the populations of T. teguixin from the Araguaia basin and from Roraima, relatively to the 

populations of Cuyabeno (Equador). The two Brazilian populations are separated by the 

lower course of several large rivers flowing from the Brazilian Shield (Araguaia, Tocantins, 

Xingú and Tapajós), and of the Amazonas itself. On the other hand, several rivers like 

Negro, Japurá and Napo exist between the populations of Roraima and Cuyabeno. 

However, in the latter case, the areas are separated by the headwaters of these rivers. 

These findings appear not to be consistent with the predictions of the Riverine Barrier 

Hypothesis (Haffer, 1997; Lougheed et al, 1999), since it would be expected that the river 

barrier effect would be greater in the lower course of the river. 

A very different situation occurs with A. n. brasiliensis. Despite being no reciprocal 
monophyly of the haplotypes from both banks, the monophyly of the western bank is 

strongly supported. The eastern bank is, however, paraphyletic relatively to the western 

bank, which might suggest dispersal from one bank to the other (Patton et al., 2000), most 

probably from the eastern (paraphyletic) to the western (monophyletic) bank. The 

haplotypes from FLV are located eastern to Araguaia (and Javaés), and are much more 

divergent from the Araguaia haplotypes, than both banks are from each other. However, 

as previously referred, the FLV clade might represent a different subspecies. Thus, we 

consider that river Araguaia limitates, at least partially, the genetic flow in A. n. 
brasiliensis. Glor and collaborators (2001) detected a very deep split between the 
subspecies of A. nitens north and south of the Amazonas river. 

Tupinambis teguixin and Ameiva ameiva are heliothermic lizards (Vitt and Colli, 
1994; Sartorius et al., 1999; Vitt et al, 2008b) and at least T. teguixin is known to be a 
good swimmer (Ávila-Pires, 1995; Vitt et al., 2008b). We had the opportunity, for a couple 

of times, to observe A. ameiva swimming in flooded pitfalls and submerging for several 
times when we tried to capture them. At the time, they also seem to have no problem 

dealing with water. Vitt and Zani (1998) found this species several times in wet ground. 

We also frequently observed both species in beaches and river bluffs along Araguaia and 

its tributaries. On the contrary, A. n. brasiliensis was never found in these habitats, 
probably because of thermal restrictions (Vitt et al., 2008a), since beaches and bluffs were 

frequently exposed to direct sunlight. Anolis n. brasiliensis is a diurnal and non-

heliothermic lizard, occurring almost only in shaded places or exposed to filtered sunlight  

(Mesquita et al., 2006; Vitt et al., 2008a). For a forest-specialist species, a river such as 

Araguaia, with exposed bluffs and large sand beaches, might be an even greater barrier 

than just the flowing water, much more than for heliothermic species that are frequently 

active on transitional or open areas. 

 

6.5.3 – Some considerations on genus Tupinambis 
The taxonomy of the genus Tupinambis was involved in substantial confusion until 

the 1990 decade. Ávila-Pires (1995) clarified part of this confusion by assigning the 

Amazonian form, previously known as T. nigropunctatus, to T. teguixin (which is now the 
valid name for that species) and the Central Brazilian form, previously known as T. 
teguixin, to T. merianae. A few years later, a new species, T. quadrilineatus, was 
described for the Cerrado biome, almost simultaneously by different authors (Manzani and 

Abe, 1997; as T. cerradensis by Colli et al. 1998). A molecular phylogeny by Fitzgerald et 
al. (1999) clarified the phylogenetic relationships inside Tupinambis, but draw attention to 
the non-monophyletic relation between T. duseni and T. rufescens. However, these 
authors considered them to be valid species based on morphological data. These findings 

were later corroborated by Peres and Colli (2004). A new species T. palustris was 
described by Manzani and Abe (2002) but was considered a junior synonim of T. teguixin 
by Peres (2003). Fitzgerald et al. (1999) found substantial genetic divergence between 

population of T. teguixin from Roraima (Brazil) and Cuyabeno (Equador). The divergence 
between these two populations was comparable to the divergence of valid species within 

genus Tupinambis. Peres (2003) found no morphological support for geographical 
structure within T. teguixin. 

The analysis of our data together with the data by Fitzgerald et al. (1999) and an 

additional sample of T. quadrilineatus generated in the study by Pellegrino et al. (2001), 

allowed us to clarify some issues. First, we were able to confirm the sympatry of three 

Tupinambis species in the region of the mid-Araguaia. Despite the large size of this 

species, the sympatry of Tupinambis species was reported several times (Ávila-Pires 
1995; Colli et al, 1998; Fitzgerald et al, 1999; Peres and Colli, 2003). There is a report on 

the sympatry of T. duseni, T. merianae and T. teguixin in the state of Goiás (Abe et al., 
1992), and Ávila-Pires (1995) suggests the possibility of sympatry of the two latter species 

and T. longilineus. To our knowledge, this is however the first report on the sympatry of T. 
teguixin, T. quadrilineatus and T. merianae. Voucher specimens were only collected for T.

teguixin, since T. quadrilineatus (3 individuals) and T. merianae (1 individual) were only 
found dead on road, not suitable for voucher preparation. Even though, coloration patterns 

were consistent with the patterns of the latter two species, and their identification was 

corroborated by molecular data analysis. The three species were detected within a short 

range from each other (less than 10 Km), but in different habitats. T. teguixin was allways 
captured inside or near gallery forests and seasonally flooded forests around Araguaia, 

Coco and Javaés rivers. T. quadrilineatus was found in a road crossing a Cerrado sensu 
strictu area, near forested patches, while T. merianae in a more open area. These findings 
are consistent with the ecology of these tree species (Ávila-Pires, 1995; Colli et al, 1998; 

Colli et al, 2002). Niche segregation might justify the frequent sympatry between such 

large lizards. 

Second, by adding samples from T. quadrilineatus to phylogenetic analyses we 
found some evidence that this species would be sister to T. longilineus. When describing 
T.  quadrilineatus (in the original reference: T. cerradensis), Colli and collaborators (1998) 
analyzed allozyme data and found greater genetic distances between T. quadrilineatus 
and T. merianae than between the former and T. teguixin. Based on morphological data, 
Ávila-Pires (1995) concluded that T. longilineus was closer to T. teguixin than to the other 
known species. These findings were supported by the morphological data analysed by 

Colli and collaborators (1998) and later by molecular analysis (Fitzgerald et al., 1999). It is 

important to notice that tissue samples were not available for T. longilineus in the study 
from Colli et al. (1998) and that T. quadrilineatus was also not included in the molecular 
analysis by Fitzgerald et al. (1999). Thus, our findings do not contradict any of the 

previous findings, but suggest that T. quadrilineatus and T. longilineus might in fact be 
sister taxa. These two species would then by closer to T. teguixin than to the species from 
the southern clade detected by Fitzgerald et al. (1999). 

Third, our re-analysis of the data from Fitzgerald and collaborators, provides very 

little support for the monophyly of T. teguixin. In the original analysis, the authors found 
that the divergence between T. teguixin from Roraima and Cuyabeno was comparable to 
some interspecific relationships within the genus Tupinambis. Here, the monophyly of the 
Roraima and the Araguaia populations is corroborated by MP and NJ analysis, but 

receives little support from BI analysis. However, even less support, in all phylogenetic 

analysis, is provided to the monophyly of the three intraspecific populations of T. teguixin. 
Average pairwise divergence between the clades corroborates that T. teguixin populations 
from Roraima and from the Araguaia are significantly less divergent than other taxa. The 



 
 
 
Chapter 6 

144 
 

divergence between any of these populations and the population from Cuyabeno is 

however not significantly lower the divergence between the latter and the closest relatives 

to T. teguixin, which appear to be T. longilineus and T. quadrilineatus. Thus, and despite 
the lack of support from morphological data (Peres, 2003), we reinforce the suggestion by 

Fitzgerald and collaborators, that significant variation within T. teguixin might be found in 
an expanded analysis.

7.1 – On the study and monitoring of herpetofauna 

One of the most important steps in research is to clearly identify the questions to 

be answered and to devise an approach based on these questions (Heyer et al., 1994; 

Ratti and Garton, 1996). However, if different questions are to be addressed at the same 

time, demanding different methodological approaches, a level of compromise must be 

achieved. To update the species check-list for a given taxonomic group and region, at the 

same time that one tries to obtain data that allow the comparison of different areas, and to 

obtain a sufficiently large and widespread sample of some target species can become 

conflicting objectives. 

As reported in this thesis (Chapter II), different techniques capture different sets of 

species, and individual species are more or less prone to be captured by each capture 

technique. If the objective is to try to sample as much species as possible in a particular 

region, it is a common opinion that it is advisable to apply a set of different capture 

techniques (e.g.: Mengak and Guyn 1987; Greenberg et al. 1994; Voss and Emmons 

1996; Crosswhite et al. 1999; Hutchens and DePerno, 2009). An alternative approach to 

capture, which can be applied in the study of some particular taxa, is the use of artificial 

habitats. Artificial pools (Gascon, 1994), artificial covers (Fellers and Drost, 1994), or 

artificial pipe refuges (as reported in Chapter III) can be used, with different levels of 

success, in the study of amphibian and reptile taxa. The use of artificial habitats allows 

some level of standardization, which can be important for long-term studies and 

population monitoring. The analysis of different characteristics of artificial refuges can 

provide us an insight into the ecological preferences of colonizing species, as already 

suggested by Johnson and Semlitsch (2003) and Pittman et al. (2008). It is important to 

stress that some species would certainly be more prone to use these artificial habitats, 

than others, and that inter-specific comparisons might become compromised. 

However, this is a problem I found to be transversal to several capture methods. 

Excluding methods that result in total counts of individuals, the reliability of estimation 

methods depend on several variables, such as: a) the accuracy of the observer (Hayek, 
1994); b) the size, color, vagility or any other factor that influences the detectability of a 
species (Lancia et al, 1996); c) the different efficiency of the method for different taxa 
(Corn, 1994); d) or the social behavior or any kind of territoriality or gregarious behavior 
(Scott and Woodward, 1994). I believe that these limitations should not be considered an 

impediment to the collection and analysis of field data, rather should work as cautionary

notes to be accounted when choosing methods and analyzing and comparing data from 

different taxa or locations. 

Field data are still the primary and most important kind of data for informed 

decision-making regarding conservation strategies. Estimation of species richness, 

complementarity, irreplaceability (Diniz-Filho et al., 2004, 2006, 2007; Costa et al 2007) or 

any other dimension of biodiversity based on meta-data is a very useful approach when 

field-data are sparse, unevenly distributed or even inexistent. These macro-scale are 

subjected to bias (Bini et al., 2006) but might provide important insights to biodiversity 

patterns and point regional and local biodiversity hotspots. An example is the 

corroboration of the results of Costa et al. (2007), which point lower species richness at 

the periphery of Cerrado biome, by the data presented in Chapter IV. For the middle 

Araguaia basin, both the anuran and squamate species diversity proved to be greater 

than previously estimated but, even though, not higher than in other Cerrado or 

Amazonian localities. Our results also corroborated previous field data (Nogueira et al, 

2005; Nogueira et al., 2009), which point for higher diversity in the interfluvial areas than 

in gallery forests, in the Cerrado biome. These findings support the idea that long-term 

biodiversity assessments and monitoring are still one of the keystones of efficient wildlife 

conservation and management planning. 

 

 

7.2 – The dynamic relation between river and herps 

Large rivers, just as mountains and canyons, are frequently considered as 

potential barriers to the dispersal of species and the gene flow between populations. Here, 

we tested the hypothesis that the Araguaia could be a barrier to a different set of species 

(Chapters V and VI). In most cases, in turned out that species were able to cross the river 

and exchange genes. This was the case for the three studied amphibian species (Chapter 

V). However, in the case of the least vagile species, Elachistocleis ovalis, two divergent 
lineages were found. The single fact that some haplotypes were shared between 

riverbanks should not constitute evidence that Araguaia River was not the cause of this 

divergence. The fact that individuals could migrate from on bank to the other does not 

invalidate that it was sufficiently low to allow diversification. However, in such a situation, it 

would be expected that the populations on the two sides of the river were sister to each 

other (Patton et al, 2000; Haffer, 2008). However, our phylogenetic analyses failed to 

support the monophyly of the two Araguaia clades relatively to a very distant population 



 
 
 

Final Discussion

from Panama. This result better suggests that the Araguaia is probably an area of 

secondary contact between two non-sister populations originated elsewhere (Patton et al., 

2000), and that these are able to cross Araguaia at some extent. 

The results obtained with lizards were not much different (Chapter VI). The 

Araguaia seems to constitute no barrier for the two teiid lizards, which are larger, more 

active and less habitat-restricted than Anolis nitens brasiliensis. The former, Ameiva 
ameiva and Tupinambis teguixin are not restricted to forested areas (Vitt and Colli, 1994; 
Ávila-Pires, 1995; Sartorius et al., 1999) and spend much time actively searching for food 

(Colli et al., 1997; Vitt and Zani, 1998). Anolis n. brasiliensis, on the other hand, spends 
most of its time within forested areas, in fixed positions, ambushing preys (Vitt and Zani, 

1998; Vitt et al., 2008). This species appears not to be able to cross the Araguaia River, at 

least frequently enough to leave a genetic signature. In the case of this polychrotid lizard, 

we found no evidence of haplotype share across the river and the western bank was 

monophyletic relatively to the eastern bank. This result is consistent with a scenario of 

dispersal of a original population from one side to the other of Araguaia. The hypothesis 

that Araguaia might be a barrier to this species is supported in two ways. First, at the 

subspecies level, the phylogeny of Anolis nitens appears to be influenced by the Amazon 
River (Glor et al., 2001). Second, despite the much larger sampling effort in the eastern 

side of the Araguaia, only one Anolis species was found on the eastern bank. However, a 
second species, Anolis ortonii was once captured in the western bank, very near to the 
river (Chapter IV). Anolis ortonii is a species widely distributed in Amazonia and in the 
northern portion of the Atlantic Forest (Peres and Donoso-Barros, 1986; Ávila-Pires, 

1995). Because, despite all sampling effort, we were never able to find this species on the 

eastern bank, we believe that the Araguaia River might constitute a distribution limit for 

this species. 

In resume, the Araguaia River appears to play different roles with different species 

(see also Rocha et al., submitted), most often not limiting their dispersal. The dynamics of 

this river, with the accretion and isolation of large islands (Latrubesse, 2009), might 

provide the appropriate vehicle for transferring the individuals, and their genes, from one 

bank to the other, as already suggested by other authors (Haffer, 1997; Gascon et al, 

1998). For some Amazonian species, like the large Tupinambis teguixin, the alluvial and 
gallery forest of the Araguaia and its tributaries are better explained as corridors, 

extending their distribution into the Cerrado biome (Ávila-Pires,1995).

7.3 – Conservation areas and species assemblages 

A project for the establishment of an ecological corridor, with an area of 10 million 

hectares, in the region of the middle Araguaia has been in the paper for a long time 

(Arruda, 2003; MMA, 2005). According to these authors, this corridor would comprise: four 

indigenous areas, three sustainable use areas, and one federal and two state strict 

conservation areas. It would comprise 36 municipalities from the states of Goiás, Mato 

Grosso, Tocantins and Pará. However, the implementation depends on the participative 

management of all the intervenient parts, which has not yet been achieved. In some 

cases, the borders of the conservation areas included in the project still are, or recently 

were, matter of debate (MPF-TO, 2005; MPF-TO, 2010). The area of implementation of 

the ecological corridor Bananal-Araguaia lies within the deforestation arc between 

Amazonia and Cerrado, a region under strong deforestation pressure (Azevedo-Ramos 

and Galatti, 2002; Vieira et al., 2008). 

The human pressure in the five municipalities that comprise our study area goes 

with the general trend (Table 7.1). It becomes clear from the data in the table that human 

pressure is much higher in the western border of Araguaia River, in Santana do Araguaia, 

state of Pará, where no state or federal conservation units exist. On the eastern side, the 

municipality of Pium encompasses both the Parque Estadual do Cantão (PEC) and 

Parque Nacional do Araguaia (PNA). The remaining area of Pium municipality and from 

the municipalities of Caseara and Marianópolis are located within the Área de Protecção 

Ambiental do Bananal/Cantão (APABC). The latter is a sustainable use area and human 

pressure is much higher in APABC than in PEC, where only a handful of ribeirinhos is 
allowed to reside.

Final Discussion  

159 
 

 

However, according to our results, APABC harbors a significant portion of the 

regional biodiversity that is not present within the strict conservation area of PEC. Despite 

being less intensively sampled, Fazenda Santa Fé (FSF), in the state of Pará, also 

appears to have the potential to harbor some species that do not occur in the eastern 

border of the Araguaia River. In a recent study by Negrões et al. (2011), FSF presented a 

higher species richness for medium and large mammals, than PEC. In our study, only one 

species captured in FSF was not present in PEC or APABC. The highly seasonal nature 

of the Araguaia alluvial plains, and its low heterogeneity, are surely an impediment for the 

establishment of several vertebrate species, which are able to colonize the surrounding 

areas, which are drier and more heterogeneous. In resume, it becomes clear that 

successful conservation will result not only from the creation of strict conservation areas, 

but also from integration with surrounding areas. Indigenous lands, sustainable use areas 

and private forests might play an important role in the preservation of regional fauna and 

ecosystems, an opinion shared by several other researchers (Peres, 2004; Campos and 

Nepstad, 2005; Rylands and Brandon, 2005; Azevedo-Ramos et al., 2006; Gardner et al, 

2006; Negrões et al., 2011). 

 

 

7.4 – Is there room for everyone? 
Besides deforestation rates, the region of the arc of deforestation in the 

Southeastern Amazonia is in the top list for several other reasons: number and size of 

bovine herds; violence against rural workers; slave work; land concentration and, recently, 

land redistribution (Girardi et al., 2008). Data from South America and other tropical areas 

indicate that environmental degradation is intimately connected with social instability and 

poverty (Fragoso et al., 2004; Rudel, 2005; Sanchez et al., 2005). However, and in the 

particular case of Brazil, environmental degradation is also the result of decades of 

inefficient large-scale agricultural and logging activities, many times with the political and 

economical support of national governments (Klink and Moreira, 2002; Fearnside, 2005; 

Rudel et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005; Clement, 2006; Ratter et al., 2006). A recent study by 

Rangel and co-authors (2007) found that patterns of modern agriculture and cattle 

ranching were better predictors of conflict with conservation planning, than human 

population density. 



 
 
 
Chapter 7 

160 
 

Brazilian Ministry of Environment recently released a list of the top 100 illegal 

deforesters in Amazonia (MMA, 2008), which included nine settlements of rural landless 

people, with the remaining positions belonging to large private corporations or individual 

owners related with logging, livestock and agricultural activity. Almost all the 100 top 

deforesters come from the states of Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia, with the few 

remaining scattered by other Amazonian states. Judicial measures were taken against the 

transgressors. Unfortunately, deforested areas can no longer be turned into pristine areas. 

The solution might pass by the enforcement of the law in the deforestation border. 

However, there are other possible and complementary measures. There have been some 

examples of successful integration of smallholders, indigenous and local communities in 

the preservation of very large tracts of forest (McGrath et al., 2004; Sears and Pinedo-

Vasquez, 2004; Silvius, 2004; Campos and Nepstad, 2006). All these cases imply a level 

of use of forest resources, such as small-scale selective logging or subsistence hunting, 

but prevent deforestation and leave untouched large nuclear areas. Thus, measures such 

as the mediation of conflicts between the different stakeholders, the enforcement of 

Brazilian law and the integration of local communities in conservation policies, providing 

alternative sources of income, might turn to be as important as surveying and 

understanding biodiversity. The question is if we should try to preserve natural habitats 

despite the existence of local human populations or should we preserve it for and with the 

help of these communities?
