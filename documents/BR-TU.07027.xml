ABSTRACT

A Permian bentonite deposit at Melo, Uruguay is composed of a calcite-cemented sandstone containing clay

pseudomorphs of glass shards (0–0.50 m) overlying a pink massive clay deposit (0.50–2.10m). The massive

bed is composed of two layers containing quartz and smectite or pure smectite respectively. The smectite is

remarkably homogeneous throughout the profile: it is a complex mixed layer composed of three layer types

whose expandability with ethylene glycol (2EG 1EG or 0EG sheets in the interlayer zone which correspond

to low-, medium- and high-charge layers respectively) varies with the cation saturating the interlayer zone.

The smectite homogeneity through the profile is the signature of an early alteration process in a lagoonal

water which was over saturated with respect to calcite. Compaction during burial has made the bentonite

bed a K-depleted closed system in which diagenetic illitization was inhibited. Variations in major, REE and

minor element abundances throughout the massive clay deposit suggest that it originated from two successive

ash falls. The incompatible element abundances are consistent with that of a volcanic glass fractionated from

a rhyolite magma formed in a subduction/collision geological context.

Key words: bentonite, REE, incompatible elements, mixed-layer minerals, Uruguay.

INTRODUCTION

Bentonite beds are generally formed by alteration
of volcanic ash in sea, brackish or fresh waters (Grim
and Güven 1978). They represent useful chrono-
stratigraphic units that can be traced for very long
distances. They have been shown to preserve a
chemica magmatic signature (Wray 1995, Christi-

Mongelli 1996). Huff and Kolata (1989) showed
that each bentonite bed have a unique chemical sig-
nature.

A thick Permian bentonite bed (&gt; 2 m) was
discovered in the Melo area, Uruguay (Goñi 1952).
It is nearly monomineralic and is composed of an
exceptionally well-crystallized Ca-montmorillonite
(Calarge et al. 2002). The purpose of the present
work is to investigate the mineralogical and chem-

origin of the initial volcanic ashes.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

Permian bentonite beds have been described in dif-
ferent geological formations of the South East part
of the Paraná basin: Rio do Rastro area in Acegua
– RS – Brazil (Pintaude and Formoso 1972), Tuñas
and Yaguari Formations, in the Sierras Australes,
Argentina (Iñiguez et al. 1988) and the Bañado de
Medina-Melo area, Uruguay (Andreis et al. 1996)
respectively. A fossil reptile (Pareiasaurus ameri-
canus) discovered at Aceguá indicates that the ben-
tonite bed can be correlated to the Daptocephalus
biozone of the Karoo basin (Barberena et al. 1985)
which belongs to the Upper Permian (Tatarian) ac-
cording to D.C. Araújo, unpublished data.

The Melo bentonite bed crops out in a small
quarry 50 m on the South side of the Melo to Mon-
tevideo road (Uruguay) 1 km from the R7 and R6
road intersection and 20 km from the Melo city
(Fig. 1a). This bentonite bed and the Acegua one
belong to the Late Permian Yaguary Formation
(Tatarian) of the Bacia do Paraná (Andreis et al.
1996). The rocks are mostly sandstones of fluvi-
atile and eolian origin alternating with mudstone
deposits (red beds) which are typical lagoonal de-
posits formed during the Late Permian regression.
Concomitantly, the volcanic activity in the north-
ern part of Patagonia increased, peaking during the
Triassic and Early Jurassic (Andreis et al. 1996).
The magmas were silica-rich, and the eruptions were
highly explosive and gave rise to large ash deposits
(Axelrod 1981). The bentonite bed itself is a pink,
massive, soft rock 1.6 m thick (Fig. 1b). It is over-
lain by a calcite-cemented sandstone 50 cm thick.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

XRD ANALYSES

The bentonite samples were gently ground after
drying at 60?C and the powders were ultrasonical-
ly dispersed in distilled water. The &amp;lt;0.1 m? frac-
tion was separated using centrifugation and Ca-,
Na- and K-saturated with 1N CaCl2, NaCl or KCl,
respectively. The excess of chloride was rinsed
using ethyl alcohol until no white precipitate was
formed with AgNO3. An aliquot of the K-saturated
samples was Ca-exchanged using the same proce-
dure (K-Ca samples). Oriented and random powder
mounts were prepared for each sample. XRD pat-
terns were recorded using a Siemens D500 diffrac-
tometer (Cu K? radiation generated at 40 kV and
40 mA), equipped with a stepping motor drive on
the goniometer (SOCABIM DACO system) and a
Kevex PSI detector (resolution: 260 eV). The an-
alytical conditions regarding angular range, scan-
ning step size and counting time were 2–35 and
2–75 ?2? , 0.025 and 0.040 ?2? , 4 s for oriented pre-
parations and random powders, respectively. De-
tailed XRD patterns were obtained from random
powders in the 32–42 (4s) and 58–64 ?2? (8s) an-
gular ranges for detailed study of hkl bands charac-
teristic of 3D structures.

Calculations of XRD patterns were performed
using the MLM3C software developed by Plançon
and Drits (2000). Atomic coordinates for the dif-
ferent layer types were set as recommended by
Moore and Reynolds (1989), and the structural for-
mula determined from chemical analyses was used
to define the layer composition. The d00l of the dif-
ferent layer types was adjusted as needed within
the limits given by Sato et al. (1992) to improve
the quality of the fit (Table I).

Among the other parameters that had to be
adjusted in the trial-and-error fitting procedure, spe-
cial attention was paid to the proportions of each
layer type, and to the coherent scattering domain
size (N). The Reichweite parameter (Jagodzinski
1949) for these three-component MLM was limited
to R= 0 (random interstratification). Because on1y

the main features of the experimental XRD patterns
were reproduced, the estimated precision on the
proportion of the different layer types is about
±10%. An additional parameter describes the seg-
regation degree of the third component (Pcc).

CHEMICAL ANALYSES

Major and minor elements including Rare Earth
Elements (REE) were analyzed from bulk rock
samples by ICP-Emission spectroscopy. Trace el-
ements were analyzed by ICP-MS (Service d’ana-
lyses du CNRS, Nancy). The cation exchange ca-
pacity (CEC) of the &amp;lt;1?m fraction was obtained
from Mg2+-exchanged Ca-saturated samples, the
excess of Mg salt being carefully washed out with
ethanol. Mg2+ was then exchanged by NH+4 and
analyzed in the exchange solution by atomic absorp-
tion spectrophotometry.

TOTAL SURFACE AREA (TSA)

TSA measurements (external + internal surfaces)
were performed on the run products (&amp;lt;1?m frac-
tion) using the adsorption of ethylene glycol mono-
ethyl ether (EGME) according to the method re-
commended by Heilman et al. (1965). The total
surface area (TSA) is calculated from the measu-
red EGME mass divided by the monolayer EGME
mass adsorbed per surface unit (3.77 10?4 g m?2).

RESULTS

PETROGRAPHY

The studied profile is composed of two parts: From
the top down they are:

1) 0 to 0.50 m deep: From 0 to 20 cm, the upper
sandstone is composed of angular quartz and
feldspar grains, disseminated in a clay matrix
and cemented by calcite. It exhibits glass shard
pseudomorphs in its lower part from a depth
of 20 cm to the sandstone-bentonite interface.
Calcite cement is more abundant in the lower
than in the upper part. Feldspar, mostly pla-
gioclase, was observed only in the upper sand-
stone. Quartz and feldspar are fairly typical of

the detrital input in a deltaic environment and
are consistent with the mineral composition of
adjacent siliciclastic beds. The fact that vit-
roclastic ash structures were preserved only in
the lower part of the sandstone suggests that
volcanic debris were cemented early by car-
bonates (Jeans et al. 1977). The volcanogenic
debris, as well as the detrital grains, seem to
have been deposited simultaneously with the
precipitation of calcite.

2) 0.50 to 2.10 m deep: the bentonite bed is a mas-
sive pink clay with layer a density of 1.92 ±
0.05 g cm?3. Clay pseudomorphs are absent;
the microstructure is typical of clay-rich sedi-
ments. Calcite and dolomite crystals are pre-
sent in all the bentonite samples as trace com-
ponents (&amp;lt;1% in weight). The examination
of thin sections of the massive clay bed did
not show the presence of any magmatic phe-
nocrysts (zircon, sanidine, micas). The coarser
grains size (5 to 10?m) contains only quartz.

XRD ANALYSES

Powder XRD patterns from the massive

bentonite bed

XRD patterns from bulk rock powders show that
the bentonite bed is mostly composed of a well-
crystallized smectite. Quartz is present in the upper
part from a depth of 0.50 to 1.30 m. Other silica-
tes (feldspar, mica or zeolites) or carbonates com-
monly observed in bentonite beds are not present
here. The 0.60 diffraction peak at 1.498 Å shows

that the smectite is dioctahedral. Its intensity sug-
gests a large size of the coherent scattering domains
in the b direction (Moore and Reynolds 1989), and
is remarkably homogeneous throughout the profile.
The Ca-saturated samples exhibit a large asymme-
trical band at 2.58 Å typical of completely turbo-
stratic 3D structures (Reynolds 1992).

XRD patterns of oriented samples

(&amp;lt;1?m fraction)

Ca-saturated samples. As the studied samples are
apparently all composed of “pure smectite”, only
sample 8 (1.55m depth) will be detailed for sim-
plicity. The intensity and sharpness of the 001 peak
in the AD and EG XRD experimental patterns is
typical of a “well-crystallized” smectite (Fig. 2a-b).
However, calculated patterns (Plançon and Drits
2000) give a coherent solution for the AD and EG
XRD patterns for a random MLM of 2W or 2EG
(96%) and 1W or 1EG (4%) expanded layers (Ta-
ble II).

K-saturated samples. The expandability is strong-
ly reduced: the 001 peak shifts to 11.94 Å and
14.06 Å in the AD and EG states, respectively (Fig.
2c-d). Calculated patterns do not give a coherent
solution for the two states. Indeed, the best approx-
imations for AD and EG are a single three compo-
nent random MLM, and a mixture of two three
component random MLM respectively (Fig. 2c-d).

K-Ca saturated samples. When Ca-saturated, the
expandability of K-samples increases but does not
reach the values obtained in the Ca-saturated sam-

ples: 14.36 Å and 16.27 Å for AD and EG states
respectively. This indicates that some layers have
irreversibly fixed the K+ cations. The calculated
patterns do not give exactly the same solution for
the AD and EG states but the best solution for
both of them is a three component random and two
component random MLM (Fig. 2e-f).

All samples present the same XRD pattern dif-
ferences between the Ca-, K- and K-Ca-saturated
preparations suggesting that the crystal structure of
the smectite is remarkably constant all over the ben-
tonite bed. It is characterized by strong layer charge
heterogeneities.

Three types of layers have been considered in
the mixed layering depending on their respective
layer charges (Sato et al. 1992):

– high-charge layers: collapsed to 10 Å after K-
saturation (0 water or ethylene glycol layer:
Sm0W, Sm0EG),

– medium-charge layers:1 EG or EG in the K-
saturated state re-expanding to 2EG in the K-
Ca sample,

– low-charge layers: 2EG even in the K-saturated
samples.

Except for the Ca-saturated samples, the calculated
XRD patterns do not give similar solutions for the
AD and EG states (Table II). Such a discrepancy
may be due to the fact that water and ethylene glycol
molecules do not have the same dipolar moment.
Thus, the number of water or ethylene glycol layers
depends on the Ca and K ion distribution within the
interlayer zones.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF THE MASSIVE

BENTONITE BED

Bulk rock composition (Table III)

Based on bulk rock chemical compositions, the
massive bentonite bed appears to be divided in two
zones. The upper zone (0,5–1,55 m) is SiO2-rich
while the lower one (1,55–2,10 m) is Al2O3, Fe2O3,
CaO, MgO – rich (Figs. 3a, b, c). However, these
chemical differences could be an artefact due to

the presence of quartz in the upper zone as shown
by powder XRD patterns. Thus, it is more appro-
priate to compare ratios than absolute amounts of
major elements excluding SiO2. The MgO/CaO and
Al2O3/MgO ratios are roughly constant within the
two zones but change abruptly at –1.55 m (Figs.
3d, e). The MgO/MgO + Fe2O3 ratio decreases
from bottom to top forming two successive para-
bolic trends joining at –1.55 m (Fig. 3f). To the
chemical changes observed at –1.55 m corresponds
also changes in physical properties of the clay min-
erals. Indeed, the average TSA value (Ca-saturated
samples) is lower in the upper part: 597.90 instead
of 596.64 m2 g?1. Such a convergence between
chemical and physical properties strongly suggests
that the bentonite bed is composed of two layers,
each of them being homogeneous in itself (constant
chemical composition and TSA values).

Trace elements and REE abundances

Trace and REE element concentrations (Table IV)
vary with depth. For simplicity, elements exhibiting
the same concentration profiles have been grouped.
Four groups were distinguished: 1) identical con-
centrations amounts in the two layers (Co, Ga, Hf,
Nb, Rb, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, Zr). This group is rep-
resented by the Sr concentration profile (Fig. 4a);

2) higher concentrations in the bottom layer (Cs,
Cu, Ge, In, Pb, U, Zn). This group is represented
by the Cs concentration profile (Fig. 4b); 3) higher
concentrations in the upper layer (Ba, Be). This
group is represented by the Ba concentration pro-
file (Fig. 4c); 4) identical patterns with a larger
range of variation in the bottom layer (Ce, Dy, Er,
Eu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sb, Sm, Tb, Tm, Y,
Yb). This group is represented by the Dy concen-
tration profile (Fig. 4d). The total REE concentra-
tions in the studied samples vary from 130 to 570
ppm. However, in spite of these large differences,
the REE pattern abundances, normalized to chon-
drite, are constant in shape throughout the profile
(Fig. 4e). They all show the negative Eu anomaly.

DISCUSSION

THE ORIGIN OF THE VOLCANIC GLASS

As bentonites result from an alteration process, the
chemical composition of the initial volcanic ash is
modified through gains and losses of elements with
respect to the altering solutions. Christidis (1998)
showed that these chemical exchanges depend on
the composition of the volcanic debris and the wa-
ter/rock ratio in a marine system. Consequently, it
is excluded to use the proportions of the major ele-
ments to determine the original glass composition.

Christidis (1998) showed that only the ratios of the
relatively immobile elements in the bulk bentonite
rock (smectite + accessory minerals) are potential
indicators. Such attempts at chemical fingerprint-
ing have had mixed success because alteration pro-
cesses have been shown to variably modify the rel-
ative proportions of most elements. However, using
ratios of the so-called “immobile” elements such
as Ti, Zr, Y and Nb in the projection of Winch-
ester and Floyd (1977), the studied samples are in
the rhyolite composition field or near its boundary

with comendite/pantellerite one (Fig. 4f). The Eu
anomaly is commonly attributed to the removal of
Eu by plagioclase feldspar during fractionation of
the melt. This anomaly is typical of evolved mag-
mas.

Considering the Permian age of the bentonite
deposit, the source of the volcanic glass could be
related to a volcanic activity triggered by the col-
lision of the northern active margin of the Patag-
onian micro-plate with the South American conti-
nental plate (Ramos 1984).

THE VOLCANIC GLASS TO SMECTITE REACTION

During alteration, the rhyolitic ignimbrite lost Sr
and Rb, whereas Zr and Th display a residual en-
richment. In the present case, those elements re-
mained constant throughout the profile (group 1,
represented by the Sr concentration profile type,
Fig. 4a), indicating that the chemical balance of
the volcanic glass-to-smectite reaction was perfect-
ly constant throughout the deposit. This means that

the water/rock ratio was high enough for the re-
action to be complete. It also suggests that no other
significant chemical reaction has subsequently af-
fected the bentonite deposit.

Geological studies of the sedimentary environ-
ment have shown that the volcanic ash was deposi-
ted in a lacustrine system (Andreis et al. 1996).
The preservation of smectite pseudomorphs of glass
shards in the upper sandstone confirms that vol-
canic ashes were deposited into low energy envi-

ronments where current sorting and redistribution
were minimal (Jeans et al. 2000). Evaporation con-
centrated seawater in the lagoon until the conditions
for calcite precipitation were attained. The forma-
tion of montmorillonite instead of zeolite suggests
that the water was not highly saline or alkaline as
happens in playas. The formation of montmoril-
lonite from rhyolitic or dacitic glass produces opal
CT (Altaner and Grim 1990). In the present case,
the absence of opal CT or secondary quartz indi-
cates that oversaturation with respect to amorphous
silica was not attained. The lack of zeolite and opal
CT suggests that the solutions were continuously
diluted by fresh water from rivers forming the del-

taic environment. The presence of small amounts of
calcite and dolomite crystals in the bentonite sam-
ples indicates that calcium concentration was lower
than alkalinity (Hardie and Eugster 1970). These
conditions favor the formation of Mg smectites.

Compared to the chemical compositions of
montmorillonite formed from rhyolite ash altered
in a lacustrine environment (Zielinski 1982), the
Melo bentonite presents a number of similarities: 1)

CHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF TWO BENTONITE DEPOSITS 535

(Rb, Th, Ta, Hf, Sr) belong to group 1 (represented
by the Sr concentration profile type, Fig. 4a). There-
fore, whatever the chemical variations in the profile
were, the formation of montmorillonite happened
in identical conditions throughout the bentonite de-
posit. This process is different from the progres-
sive diagenetic transformation of volcanic glass to
smectite in deep-sea environments (Hein and Scholl
1978). In the latter case, polyphased assemblages
are produced while some glass relics survive. Fur-
ther, the smectitic minerals produced contain only
a few illite layers.

The absence of any K-bearing mineral phase
in the Melo bentonite implies that excess Si4+ and
K+ ions were leached out of the system. During
burial, as compaction increases the density of the
sediment and decreases its permeability, the ben-
tonite bed became progressively more compact and
formed a closed K-depleted chemical system in
which the smectite-to-illite diagenetic reaction was
inhibited. This explains why there are no illite-
smectite mixed layers as commonly observed in K-
bentonites (Huff and Türkmenoglü 1981, Altaner
et al. 1984). Nevertheless, even though illite is
not formed, charge heterogeneities still appear, as
shown by the effects of K- and K-Ca-saturations on
XRD patterns. The Melo smectite is an interstra-
tification of expandable layers that have different
layer charge.

In summary, the volcanic glass was probably
altered shortly after deposition in lagoonal water
that was oversaturated with respect to calcite. These
particular conditions were stable during the ash
fall, which explains the mineralogical homogeneity
throughout the profile. Afterwards, diagenetic con-
ditions did not modify the composition of the smec-
tite significantly because the compacting bentonite
bed became progressively a Ca-rich K-depleted
closed system that was improper to illitization. The
compaction process destroyed the volcanoclastic
structures, except in the upper sandstone where
these structures were preserved by the rigidity of
the calcite cement.

GRADING IN A SINGLE ASH FALL OR

IN TWO ASH FALLS?

The abrupt variation of major component concen-
trations at the depth 1.55 m (Fig. 3) suggests that
the bentonite bed is composed of two parts. This
is confirmed by variations in trace element abun-
dances elements with greater or lower abundance in
the upper layer, i.e., Cs, Cu, Ge, In, Pb, U, and Zn,
(group 2, represented by the Cs concentration pro-
file type, Fig. 4b) or Ba and Be (group 3, represented
by the Be concentration profile type, Fig. 4c) and
Dy concentration profile type for group 4 (Fig. 4d)
respectively. Compared to sample 8 (1.55 m depth)
which has the lowest REE abundance, most of the
upper ones appear to be more HREE depleted than
the lower ones (Fig. 4e). The La/Yb ratio varies
from 3,04 to 7,80. This means that the HREE were
partially leached (Christidis 1998). The four groups
of elements are shown in Figures 5a to 5d.

There variations in the amounts of major and
trace elements are significant. They suggest that
either the chemical composition of the magmatic
products has varied during a rhythmic volcanic
eruption, or that two successive eruptions produced
the ash falls. In either scenario, the two ash de-
posits were superimposed before the transforma-
tion of glass into smectite. The lack of any detrital
deposit between the two parts militates for a single
rhythmic event. Unfortunately, as magmatic phe-
nocrysts and particularly heavy minerals have not
been found in the massive bentonite bed, it is almost
impossible to discriminate between the two alter-
natives.

A POSSIBLE RHYOLITIC COMPOSITION

Even if most of the major element abundances are
modified during the transformation of volcanic glass
to smectite, the less mobile ones (Fe3+, Al) sug-
gest that the initial ash composition was closer to
rhyolite than to rhyodacite or andesite. This is con-
firmed by the so-called “immobile” elements such
as Ti, Zr, Y and Nb. Using ratios rather than ab-
solute values, the projection from Winchester and
Floyd (1977) can be applied to altered volcanic ma-

terials such as bentonites (Huff et al. 1993). In the
present case, most of the studied samples are in the
rhyolite composition field or near its boundary with
comendite/pantellerite (Fig. 4f). The Eu anomaly is
commonly attributed to the removal of Eu by pla-
gioclase feldspar during fractionation of the melt.
This anomaly is typical of evolved magmas.

Therefore, the Melo bentonite probably deri-
ved from ash resulting from an explosive frag-
mentation of the residual melt, after plagioclase
feldspar crystallized from a rhyolitic magma. This
is confirmed by spider diagrams (Figs. 5a to 5d)
normalized to a subduction/collision rhyolite glass
(Juteau and Maury 1997). Considering that the neg-

ative Rb, K and Eu anomalies are related to mag-
matic differentiation and plagioclase crystallization
respectively, it appears that the bentonite patterns
are close to the reference line.

CONCLUSION

Based on its chemical characteristics, the thick
Melo bentonite bed resulted probably from the su-
perposition of two different volcanic ash deposits.
Using the distribution of incompatible elements,
the composition of the original glass appears to be
similar to that of glass resulting from the fractiona-
tion of a rhyolitic magma in a subduction/collision

setting. It is to be noticed that the chemical dif-
ferences between the two ash falls were not suffi-
cient to cause a mineralogical contrast. The high ho-
mogeneity of the smectitic minerals throughout the
massive bentonite suggests that the volcanic glass
has been altered in stable chemical conditions im-
posed by the sedimentary environment.

rosado (0.50–2.10 m). A camada maciça é composta

por dois níveis contendo quartzo e esmectita ou esmectita

pura, respectivamente. A homogeneidade de esmectita ao

longo do perfil é notável: trata-se de um interestratificado

composto de três tipos de camadas, cuja expansibilidade

com etileno-glicol (folhas 2EG, 1EG ou 0EG na zona in-

terfoliar correspondentes a camadas com baixa, média e

alta carga, respectivamente) variam com o tipo de cátion

que satura a zona interfoliar. A homogeneidade da es-

mectita ao longo do perfil é a assinatura de um processo

de alteração precoce em uma água lagunar supersaturada

em calcita. A compactação durante o soterramento tornou

a camada de bentonita um sistema fechado empobrecido

em K no qual a ilitização diagenética foi inibida. Varia-

ções nas abundâncias de elementos maiores, menores e

ETR no depósito maciço de argila sugere que este foi

originado a partir de duas quedas sucessivas de cinza.

A abundância de elementos incompatíveis é consistente

com a de um vidro vulcânico fracionado a partir de um

magma riolitico formado em um ambiente geológico de

subducção/colisão.
