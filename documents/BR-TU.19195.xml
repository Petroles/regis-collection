SUMMARY 

 

Octopus vulgaris is one of the most important fishery resources in the coastal area of the 

Atlantic Iberian basin. One to two years lifespan, terminal semelparity with numerous eggs 

and the absence of generation overlap are the reasons for high variability in the species 

abundance between years strongly connected with environmental conditions. The overall 

aim of this thesis is to identify which factors, physical, environmental and biologic 

influencing the Octopus vulgaris life cycle. First of all, we look at the reproductive season 

of the species in the northwest and south Portuguese coasts and conclude that spawning 

depends on the local oceanographic regime but also partially on the nutritional quality of 

the food. The study was followed by an analysis of the local factors that influence 

abundance in the nursery of Ría de Vigo (Southwest Galicia). Here, the newly-hatched 

paralarvae concentrate in shallow waters and protected areas under the influence of the 

Cies islands and feed on the meso-zooplanktonic community that supply these paralarvae 

with the adequate nutritional requirements balanced to protein but also rich in n-3HUFA 

fatty acids essential for growth and survival at this stage. After settlement, the physical and 

environmental characteristics of the feeding grounds are essential for recruitment success. 

Here we identified five areas of pre-recruit aggregation along the Portuguese Coast. 

Finally, the age and growth were determined for juveniles of the Northwest Portuguese 

coast. Age estimates are fundamental tools to chronologically follow the effect of the 

environmental factors through the life cycle. Here, ageing methodologies using the stylets 

as age recorders were improved to achieve precision and accuracy in ageing estimates in 

this species. The results and conclusions of the thesis present important data to incorporate 

in the future ecosystem approach models for the assessment and management of the 

octopus fisheries in the Portuguese coast.

RESUMO 

 

Octopus vulgaris é um dos recursos marinhos mais capturados na área costeira da costa 

Ibérica Atlântica. A longevidade de um a dois anos, semelparidade com descendência 

numerosa e ausência de sobreposição de gerações faz com que a abundância da espécie 

varie muito de um ano para o outro em função de condições ambientais. O objetivo geral 

desta tese é identificar quais os fatores físicos, ambientais e biológicos que condicionam o 

ciclo de vida das populações de O. vulgaris da costa continental portuguesa. Para 

desenvolver esta tese observámos, numa primeira fase, a época reprodutiva das duas 

populações da costa noroeste e sul portuguesas concluindo que esta depende do regime 

oceanográfico local mas também é parcialmente influenciada pela disponibilidade 

nutricional no momento. De seguida, analisaram-se os fatores locais que fazem com que a 

Ría de Vigo (Galiza) seja área de berçário importante para esta espécie. Aqui as paralarvas 

recém-eclodidas concentram-se em águas pouco profundas do interior da ria junto às Ilhas 

Cies, onde se alimentam da comunidade de meso-zooplâncton que lhes fornece o equilíbrio 

nutricional adequado de proteínas e lípidos e o suficiente em ácidos gordos poli-

insaturados da família n-3 de que necessitam para a fase de crescimento exponencial que 

ocorre até ao assentamento. Após o assentamento, as características físicas e ambientais e 

locais são essenciais para o sucesso do recrutamento à pesca. Com este trabalho, 

identificaram-se e caracterizaram-se cinco áreas de agregação de juvenis ao longo da costa 

Portuguesa. Finalmente, foram abordados a idade e o crescimento. A estimação da idade é 

uma ferramenta essencial para acompanhar cronologicamente o efeito dos fatores 

ambientais ao longo do ciclo de vida. Neste trabalho foram desenvolvidas metodologias 

que permitiram melhorar a precisão e a exatidão das estimativas diretas da idade dos 

polvos a partir da deposição de anéis de crescimento na concha vestigial. Os resultados e 

conclusões obtidos ao longo deste documento oferecem dados fundamentais para os 

modelos de abordagem ecossistémica que serão usados na futura avaliação e gestão efetiva 

do polvo-comum na costa continental portuguesa.

RESUMO ALARGADO 

 

O polvo-comum Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier 1797) é um dos mais importantes recursos 

explorados pela frota pesqueira em Portugal e na Galiza. Com desembarques em Portugal 

na ordem das 7 500 toneladas (média dos desembarques registados entre 1982 e 2012) dos 

quais 90% são da responsabilidade da frota artesanal e costeira, este é o recurso que 

permite maior rendimento ao pescador no leilão de primeira venda uma vez que associa 

frequentemente a espécie com maior peso desembarcado e o valor de primeira venda mais 

elevado (em média, no mesmo período, 4€/kilo). Estes dois fatores fazem com que o 

polvo-comum seja considerado atualmente um recurso de rendimento garantido para várias 

frotas artesanais e de pequena escala. Este rendimento garantido não passa despercebido à 

frota industrial de arrasto de fundo que é hoje em dia responsável por 10 % dos 

desembarques totais de Polvo-comum em águas portuguesas. Porém, o interesse do Polvo-

comum como recurso pesqueiro é partilhado pelas comunidades costeiras de Espanha, 

Itália e outros países mediterrânicos. Em particular, a comunidade autónoma da Galiza é 

responsável por desembarcar em média 5, 700 ton de polvo por ano. 

Ao nível ecológico e biológico, O. vulgaris é uma das espécies que melhor se adapta 

a diferentes condições ambientais como mostra a sua extensa distribuição geográfica desde 

o Mediterrâneo, passando pelo Atlântico Sul, Sul do Índico e Noroeste do Pacífico. Hoje 

em dia considera-se mesmo que O. vulgaris é um complexo de espécies que engloba O. 

oculifer, O. tetricus e O. insularis. A pressão evolutiva sobre a espécie favoreceu a redução 

da concha vestigial a dois bastonetes com função de suporte do funil, melhorando a 

mobilidade e passagem para águas mais profundas, a adoção do estilo de vida bento-

pelágico com uma recente fase paralarvar pelágica, a estratégia reprodutiva de 

semelparidade com a produção de milhares de ovos numa única desova terminal e proteção 

materna dos ovos durante o desenvolvimento embrionário. O. vulgaris é também um 

predador do nível superior da cadeia trófica que se alimenta de forma oportunistica de 

peixes, crustáceos e outros moluscos. Por isto, podemos dizer que O. vulgaris se 

especializou em ser um generalista. 

Para espécies como esta que combinam uma fase paralarvar pelágica relativamente 

longa com uma fase bentónica juvenil e adulta sedentária (não são conhecidos padrões 

migratórios significativos) as condições ambientais que uma e outra experimentam são 

particularmente importantes para a sobrevivência e o sucesso do recrutamento à pesca.

Neste aspeto, a costa Ibérica Atlântica apresenta condições ideais para avaliar como a 

espécie se adapta a diferentes ambientes. Aqui podemos encontrar dois regimes 

oceanográficos diferentes cujas características costeiras influenciam diretamente os ciclos 

biológicos. Na costa noroeste, a circulação costeira (até aos 200 m) é dominada pelo 

Sistema de afloramento costeiro Ibérico ocidental (Western Iberian Upwelling System, 

WIUS). Aqui os ciclos biológicos da maioria das espécies são influenciados pela 

sazonalidade e intensidade do afloramento costeiro provocado pelo padrão de ventos 

predominantes de norte da primavera e verão, alternando com ventos de sudoeste 

predominantes no Inverno que promovem uma contra circulação de água mais quente e 

menos salina junto à costa em direcção ao pólo. Na costa sul, o afloramento costeiro 

sazonal não é tão intenso devido ao efeito sombra provocado pela orientação a sul da costa, 

onde a circulação depende do padrão de ventos este-oeste. Aqui os ciclos biológicos estão 

sincronizados com a época de maior temperatura da água do mar e com os regimes de 

input de nutrientes provenientes das bacias hidrográficas do Guadiana e do Guadalquivir e 

a sua área de influência que depende da orografia local.  

Esta tese desenvolve-se em cinco capítulos de forma a explicar o condicionamento 

das condições ambientais sobre o ciclo do O. vulgaris, focando-se no ciclo reprodutivo da 

espécie nas duas áreas da costa continental portuguesa que apresentam condições 

oceanográficas diferentes; nas características físicas, ambientais e nutricionais que habitats 

reconhecidos como importantes berçários ou áreas de alimentação apresentam e que fazem 

deles habitats essenciais (Essential Fish Habitats, EFH) e no desenvolvimento de 

ferramentas de estimação da idade e do crescimento da espécie. O capítulo 1 faz o 

enquadramento da tese no que diz respeito à exploração do recurso no mundo e em 

especial em Espanha e Portugal, sobre os eventos evolutivos relevantes para a plasticidade 

ambiental da espécies, sobre as características e regime oceanográfico da área costeira 

menos profunda (&amp;lt;200 m) da costa Ibérica Atlântica e por último sobre a metodologia 

escolhida para estudar o ciclo de vida da espécie.  

No capítulo dois são analisados os ciclos de reprodução de duas populações da costa 

continental portuguesa e que estão sujeitas aos dois regimes oceanográficos da costa 

continental portuguesa. Inicialmente foi estudada uma série temporal de dados biológicos 

de peso, sexo, estado de maturação e índice gonadossomático que permitiu concluir que 

apesar das épocas em que podemos encontrar mais indivíduos em estado reprodutivo serem 

coincidentes no Verão, na costa noroeste a época reprodutiva prolonga-se por toda a 



Resumo Alargado

Primavera e Verão e coincide com o afloramento costeiro sazonal; enquanto que na costa 

sul, a época reprodutiva (a época com a maior proporção de indivíduos maduros) ocorre no 

fim do Verão em Agosto/Setembro e coincide com a época do ano em que temperatura da 

água do mar atinge o seu valor máximo. Conhecendo esta diferença espacial da época de 

reprodução e sabendo que à partida podemos encontrar indivíduos maduros ao longo de 

todo ano, investigou-se se as condições nutricionais encontradas fora e durante a época 

reprodutiva variam e se esta variação poderia afectar a condição nutricional dos ovos. 

Analisaram-se classes de lípidos e ácidos gordos na glândula digestiva e nas gónadas de 

fêmeas imaturas e maduras das duas áreas de estudo. Os resultados mostram que apesar de 

existirem diferenças significativas na qualidade da alimentação que o polvo encontra numa 

e noutra costa, estas diferenças não afectam a qualidade dos ovos, indicando que os 

factores que despoletam a reprodução são fundamentalmente intrínsecos ao organismo e 

não à quantidade ou qualidade do alimento encontrado. 

O capítulo três lida com os fatores e áreas que potenciam a sobrevivência de 

paralarvas e juvenis. Numa espécie cujos adultos têm poucos predadores (o seu maior 

predador é o homem) e que são bastante resistentes às condições ambientais adversas, a 

maior parte da pressão sobre os indivíduos ocorre antes (na fase de paralarva) e durante o 

assentamento (quando chegam a sub adulto). A Ría de Vigo é protegida na sua embocadura 

pelas Ilhas Ciés que funcionam como barreira à ondulação de oeste e sudoeste, 

predominante na costa nordeste Atlântica e formam a fronteira exterior da Ría de Vigo. 

Aqui, monitoriza-se regularmente a comunidade de zooplancton da Ría em transectos 

longitudinais às Ilhas Cies localizados a oeste (fora da Ría) e a este destas (dentro da Ría). 

Os resultados mostram que as maiores abundâncias de zooplankton se correlacionam com 

as áreas de menor profundidade e mais próximas das ilhas. Estas condições facilitam a 

análise do teor nutricional das potenciais presas das paralarvas nesta área de berçário e 

como o perfil nutricional varia entre presas e predadores. As maiores diferenças são 

quantitativas com variações em alguns rácios nutricionais como o rácio n-3HUFA/n-

6HUFA, nas razões DHA/ARA e DHA/EPA mas em especial as paralarvas de O. vulgaris 

apresentam um teor significativamente maior em ARA do que as suas presas. Os resultados 

que obtivemos neste capítulo permitem confirmar a importância da manutenção da razão 

Proteina: Lípidos entre presas e predadores mas também evidenciam a importância de 

disponibilidade de uma fonte de n-3 HUFA para suprir os requisitos em ARA essencial 

para o crescimento. O capítulo três descreve ainda as áreas de alimentação e crescimento

dos juvenis. Aqui, definiram-se ao longo da costa portuguesa 8 áreas de maior abundância 

de pré-recrutas. Estas áreas localizam-se em zonas de pouca profundidade 

(aproximadamente 80 m) sob a influência dos grandes estuários onde a abundância de 

potenciais presas é maior. Este estudo permitiu também concluir que as condições de 

salinidade local são muito mais determinantes para a agregação dos juvenis do que a 

temperatura local. 

O capítulo quatro lida com o desenvolvimento de metodologias de estimação direta 

de idades que permitam a estimação mais precisa e exacta da idade individualmente. A 

maioria dos modelos de avaliação de mananciais de pesca requer a inclusão de informação 

relativa à estrutura etária das populações exploradas. Porém, a impossibilidade de observar 

incrementos de crescimento diário nos estatólitos, a erosão a que as mandíbulas estão 

sujeitas ao longo da vida, e a fragilidade da estrutura do bastonete (concha vestigial) que 

impossibilitava o uso das técnicas abrasivas de corte e polimento e a reprodutibilidade das 

observações têm sido obstáculos difíceis de ultrapassar. Só recentemente, com a inclusão 

dos cortes de bastonetes em resina acrílica, que preserva a estrutura interna dos bastonetes, 

foi possível melhorar a técnica da estimação de idades usando esta estrutura. Com este 

trabalho analisámos a estrutura dos bastonetes em paralarvas e juvenis, de forma a medir e 

validar marcas de crescimento determinantes como a marca de desova. Para validar a 

marca de desova, observaram-se e mediram-se bastonetes de paralarvas com 1 e 3 dias de 

idade e paralarvas capturadas no meio selvagem com menos de 10 dias. Foi possível 

observar que na desova, e logo após a mesma, é possível distinguir uma zona nuclear de 5 

µm de diâmetro e cuja dimensão é conservativa em relação à dimensão da paralarva e da 

concha vestigial. A definição desta região foi essencial para o passo seguinte de estimação 

de idades em sub adultos pós assentamento. O uso de técnicas de corte dos bastonetes 

idêntico aos métodos de corte de otólitos para a observação da microestrutura foi essencial 

para identificar pela primeira vez a área nuclear e pela primeira vez fazer uma estimativa 

directa da idade de juvenis e estimar o tempo que estes demoram a atingir o tamanho 

mínimo de captura, aproximadamente oito meses. Assim como para outras espécies do 

género Octopus, o exercício de observação da microestrutura de crescimento e estimação 

de taxas de crescimento permitiu mais uma vez confirmar que a variação individual das 

taxas de crescimento é elevada, o que torna difícil definir um modelo de crescimento que 

represente o crescimento da espécie ou de determinada população. É crítico neste caso, 

como se demostrou ao longo de toda a tese, que o ciclo de vida e a ecologia do O. vulgaris 



Resumo Alargado

seja muito dependente das condições ambientais físicas e biológicas locais, sendo 

importante que qualquer modelo de exploração que se venha a aplicar a esta espécie, 

integre e parâmetros ambientais, para que possamos prever a abundância, a disponibilidade 

do recurso e mesmo a quantidade de biomassa que se pode retirar em cada ano das 

populações residentes para que o recurso possa ser explorado de forma sustentável. 

O capítulo cinco apresenta e engloba os resultados e conclusões obtidas no contexto 

do conhecimento mais recente que se tem da biologia e ecologia da espécie O. vulgaris.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

1.1. OCTOPUS FISHERIES 
 

Cephalopods world catches have been increasing constantly during the last 40 years 

(Norman et al., 2014). This growing interest on cephalopods is related with the decline of 

the finfish catches and the perception of cephalopods as alternative protein sources for 

human consumption (Jereb et al. 2014). In this group, the octopuses (most belonging to the 

family Octopodidae) play an important role as a resource exploited by the small-scale 

fishing communities spread along the coastal areas, but and also by some industrial fleets 

(Fonseca et al., 2008). Since the 1950's, the official statistics have been showing a global 

increase in octopus annual catches (FAO, 2011-2014). The Food and Agriculture 

Organization (FAO) estimated that between 2002 and 2012 an average 334 033 ton/year of 

octopuses were captured worldwide with an increasing tendency (FAO, 2011-2014). 

Despite that, since 2009 octopus landings have been decreasing, with 2012 registering 

annual global landings of 316 582 ton (Figure 1.1). A major problem is that only a few 

countries discriminate octopus catches by species, and the relative importance of the 

common octopus Octopus vulgaris is therefore unknown. Nevertheless due to its 

commercial value, it should be expected that the octopus landings from the eastern Atlantic 

and Mediterranean waters are dominated by O. vulgaris (Pierce et al., 2010). 

 

Figure 1.1– Evolution of the worldwide annual landings of the octopus species group between 1980 and 

2012. The lines indicate the landings tendency by decade. The 2000's decade comprises the years between 

2000 and 2012 (data source: FAO, 2014). 

 



1. General introduction 

 

18 

 

In Europe, O. vulgaris is the most important exploited octopus species (ICES, 2012a; 

Tsangridis et al., 2002), the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese fleets being the most important 

contributors to the total catch (Pierce et al., 2010). In the Iberian Peninsula, O. vulgaris 

reached an average 18 639 ton/year in the last 30 years, 6 % of the worldwide octopus 

landings in the same period. Here, the general tendency of the last 32 years (1982-2012) 

show that in Portugal O. vulgaris landings have been increasing, and Spanish 

Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic catches have been decreasing both at approximately 

the same rate (Figure 1.2).  

It is worth of note that the O. vulgaris catches can vary by more than 50% between 

consecutive years. Between 2008 and 2009 for instances, octopus landings of the 

Portuguese fleet decreased by 48% in landed weight, increasing by 36 % in 2010 (Figure 

1.2; INE, 2014). The O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics, such as the short lifespan, the 

semelparity, and the lack of stock-recruitment relationship makes to be virtual impossible 

to predict fisheries outcomes from a year to another (Pita et al., in prep).  

In Portugal, O. vulgaris is captured mainly with pots and traps (around 90%) (ICES, 

2012a) by the “local fleet” (small-size boats, the majority of which do not exceed 9 m in 

total length) and the “coastal fleet” (comprised of vessels generally ranging from 9-15 m in 

total length). The multi-specific trawling fleet is responsible for the other 10% of catches 

with an increasing tendency (Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). The 

traditional small-scale fishery targeting O. vulgaris in the northeast Spanish waters is 

identical to the Portuguese fleet (Freire &amp;amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000). As in Portugal, the 

Northeast Spanish fleet is markedly local, multi-gear and multi-specific with an important 

economic and social role in the coastal fisher communities (Freire &amp;amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000; 

Otero et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the two neighboring areas seem to present distinct 

exploitation patterns, with the northeast Spanish catches being stable or slightly decreasing 

in the last 32 years, probably an influence of the fishing moratorium due to the Prestige oil 

spill, and the Portuguese catches still increasing (Figure 1.2). Another important aspect, is 

the fact that the northeast Spanish O. vulgaris catches present a marked seasonality (Otero 

et al., 2005), which is only comparable in Portugal to the octopus landings pattern found in 

cephalopod targeting  trawls (Fonseca et al., 2008).

Figure 1.2 – Evolution of the octopus annual catches in the Iberian Peninsula. Annual landings data are 

discriminated by geographical area (Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic) and by landing country (Sources: 

INE 2013; FAO, 2014). 

In Portugal and despite the unpredictable variability in the stock availability, O. 

vulgaris is the most important target species in the entire Portuguese fisheries in terms of 

economic value, when all official and non-declared landings are considered (Pilar-Fonseca 

et al., 2014) with evidences that the species’ catches play an important role as guaranty 

revenue species to the non-targeting octopus fisheries. In fact, O. vulgaris has long been an 

important target species for artisanal fishers and, nowadays, it is an increasingly important 

fishery resource in terms of quantities landed and particularly in terms of commercial 

value. O. vulgaris is frequently the species with higher value in first sale auction (mean 

price of €4/kg) and, for instance in 2012, its official catches represented 14% (€38.7 

million) of the official first sale revenue of all Portuguese fisheries, second only to sardines 

(INE, 2014).  

The increasing dependence of the Portuguese small-scale and trawling fisheries of 

the O. vulgaris stock (Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014) associated to the 

unpredictable variation in availability of the resource have, from time to time, lead to 

important pressure actions of fishers on governmental bodies, demanding protective 

measures. These fisher actions have, almost without exemption, lead to changes in the 

management rules that regulate fishing activity.  This was the case in 1996, when fishers’ 

worries about the risk of overexploitation of octopus brought them together to request 

protective measures for octopus, which resulted in the implementation of new legislation 

(Portaria nº 27/2001), and again in 2010, when a “bad” fishing year drove fishers’ action to 

change the legislation (Portaria nº 230/2012) (Pita et al., in prep).

Targeting small-scale fishery conducted with “shelter traps” (pots) (Pereira, 1999) targets 

the mature individuals of higher outcome (individual weight c.a. 1100 g, Pereira pers. 

comm), with virtually no by-catches or discards and minimum environmental damage. 

These characteristics elect the Portuguese octopus small-scale fishery as a good candidate 

for environmentally sustainable fisheries eco-labelling schemes (Matias, 2013). Although 

problems associated with the unpredictability of stock availability to fisheries, illegal and 

unreported catches, high auction first sale value and the lack of the formal producers 

organizations can be identified as constrains to the adoption of the eco-labelling. 

 

1.2. EVOLUTION AND GENETICS  

All modern cephalopods including the squids, cuttlefishes and octopuses, belong to 

the subclass Coleoidea (Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 2006; Kröger et al., 2011). Fossil records and 

molecular studies show that the Coleoidea evolved along with their sister group, the 

Nautiloidea, in the late Paleozoic, 276 Ma ago (Kröger et al., 2011) when in competition 

with modern fish, they apparently occupied the deep waters. The adaptation to this high 

pressure environment leaded to the progressive internalization of shell, trading the 

buoyancy for speed and the possibility of occupying the bentho-pelagic habitat (Kröger et 

al., 2011; Young et al., 1998).  

With the loss of shell and its shield function, the modern cephalopods gain the ability 

to swim. Consequently, the exploration of larger areas demands for more energy and to 

fulfill the higher metabolic rates, the respiratory and circulation system evolved for 

capillary circulation with two branchial hearts located at the base of each gill to enhance 

circulation within a single pair of gills and a systemic heart. The more efficient ventilation 

of the gills allowed producing a more elaborate musculature in the mantle cavity leading to 

the evolution of the primitive expulsion chamber for jet propulsion (Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 

2006). Swimming faster and becoming more maneuverable, the cephalopods also 

developed more sophisticated sensory systems, especially eyes and large brains (Nixon &amp;amp; 

Young, 2003).    

Along with the internalization and reduction of shell, the adaptation to carnivory is 

also a unique event to all coleoids (Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 2006). The development of the 

beak during embryologic development in both the Teuthidae and Octopodidae supports this 

early adaptation in the feeding behavior (Franco-Santos &amp;amp; Vidal, 2014; Franco-Santos et 



1. General introduction 

 

21 

 

al., 2014). In fact, at hatch the beaks are fully developed only growing and hardening as 

individuals grow (Franco-Santos &amp;amp; Vidal, 2014; Franco-Santos et al., 2014).  

With the adaption to the pelagic realm, the coleoids evolved in two distinct groups, 

the ten-armed, Decabrachia and the eight-armed Vampyropoda. The latter group comprises 

the Octopodidae as well as the vampire squids (Vampyroteuthidae), that in fact have ten 

arms, but two arms are reduced sensory filaments (Kröger et al., 2011).    

The first modern octopuses appeared in fossil deposits of the late Cretaceous. The 

evolution of Vampyromorpha and Octopoda as sister groups shows a trend towards the 

reduction of the gladius. The modern fin supports of the Octopoda Cirrata, and the stylet-

like shell vestiges of the Octopoda Incirrata, are considered to represent the remains of a 

teudopseid gladius (one of the three gladius morphotypes, Fuchs &amp;amp; Weis, 2010) (see 

Bizikov, 2004, for a review on stylet morphology, functional role and evolution of the 

Vampyropoda). The reduction of gladius was most probably accompanied by a shift in the 

locomotion mode. Some octopus of the modern Octopoda Incirrata had completely lost the 

ability to secrete organic shells resulting in a loss of attachment sites for fins. This radical 

shell reduction results in the increasing of extraordinary body plasticity (Kröger et al., 

2011).    

During its evolutionary pathway, the modern coleoids adopted a fast growing and 

relatively short lifespan and reproduced once pattern called semelparity (Rocha et al., 

2001; Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 2006). The modern benthic octopuses (Octopoda, Incirrata) 

show two reproductive strategies. The holobenthic strategy, where the benthic adults 

produce few and large eggs resulting in well-developed benthic hatchlings (Villanueva &amp;amp; 

Norman, 2008) and a merobenthic strategy, where benthic adults produce batches of 

numerous small eggs (c.a. 350 000 eggs for Octopus vulgaris Mangold, 1983) hatching 

into free-swimming planktonic paralarvae (Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008) showing different 

strategies to the adaptation to the benthopelagic environment (Ibáñez et al., 2014). 

Molecular studies show that in their adaption to the benthopelagic environment, the first 

octopuses would all have a planktonic paralarval phase and the holobenthic strategy 

evolved afterwards as a specialization (Ibáñez et al., 2014). 

The existence of a paralarval stage during the modern cephalopods life cycle is also a 

distinctive characteristic of this taxon. The term paralarva comes of the fact that those 

cannot be considered as a true larval stage as no truly metamorphic changes occur during 



1. General introduction 

 

22 

 

the transition between paralarva and juvenile (or sub-adult as defined in Robin et al., 2014) 

and in some cases, as the in the sepiids, the hatchlings already resemble their parents. 

Nevertheless, the transition phase from hatchling or paralarvae to sub adult implies 

considerable physiologic, morphometric, allometric and habitat changes (with different 

degrees depending of the cephalopods families) supports the definition of a paralarva life 

stage between hatch and the adoption of the adult life characteristics (Young &amp;amp; Harman, 

1988; Robin et al., 2014).        

The study conducted by Ibánez et al. (2004) supports the theory that successful 

colonization by the octopuses depend of the dispersal of the paralarva. The holobenthic 

octopuses are common in deep and cold waters while merobenthic octopuses are common 

in temperate and warm waters. And while in temperate and warm waters, shifts between 

strategies seem occurred through time, the deep and cold waters species all evolved into 

the holobenthic strategy the octopus. This differentiation of strategies seems to be related 

with environmental stability. In low temperature and low environment stochasticity as the 

deep-sea and polar environments, to survive the octopuses produce few large eggs and 

well-developed benthic hatchlings that improved the chance of survival and reproduction 

in the same benthic area. In high temperature and high environmental stochasticity, as the 

tropical and temperate habitats, to stay alive the octopuses produce numerous small eggs 

with free-swimming planktonic paralarvae that improved the chance of survival and 

reproduction using the transient opportunities of the environment between benthic and 

pelagic (Ibáñez et al., 2014).  

The Octopus vulgaris benthopelagic life cycle strategy most certainly explains its 

wide distribution and the existence of several cryptic species associated to the O. vulgaris 

species complex. This species group is composed by O. vulgaris sensu strictu (or sensu 

Cuvier, 1797) and several crypt species. In their study, Guzik et al. (2005) suggested to 

include O. oculifer from Galapagos, O. cf. tetricus from Western Australia, and O. tetricus 

from New South Wales in the species complex. Accordingly to Leite et al. (2008), this 

group also may contain the O. insularis in tropical western Atlantic. The wide range and 

number of cryptic species highlights’ the evidence that the genus Octopus is polyphyletic 

(Guerra et al., 2010). These recent findings on the species diversity and dispersion within 

the O. vulgaris species complex would suppose a reduction of the geographic range of O. 

vulgaris s. str. Nevertheless, the studies conducted by Warnke et al.(2004) and Guerra et al. 

(2010) showed evidences that O. vulgaris s. str. is monophyletic but also show evidences 



1. General introduction 

 

23 

 

of its wide distribution. The samples collected show that O. vulgaris s. str. can be found in 

coastal waters as distant as the North-eastern Atlantic waters can be from the Southern 

Indian Ocean or from North-western Pacific. Thus, the known distribution area of O. 

vulgaris s. str. is the Mediterranean Sea, the eastern Atlantic (from southern England to 

south-western Africa), the Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, St Helena, the Tristan 

da Cunha Islands, the southeast coast of South Africa in the Indian Ocean, and the north-

western Pacific, namely the waters of Taiwan and Japan (Warnke et al., 2004). 

 

1.3. BIOGEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT OF THE STUDY AREA  

To meroplanktonic organisms like O. vulgaris, that in their life cycle combine a 

planktonic paralarval stage relatively long with a benthic juvenile and adult phase with 

non-significant migratory patterns (Robin et al., 2014), the oceanographic patterns and 

coastal topography play an important role in the survival and recruitment success of each 

generation (González et al., 2005; Otero et al., 2008; 2009; Roura et al., 2013). Moreover, 

in cases as this one where the recruitment to fisheries is independent of previous generation 

stock size but dependent of the local environmental conditions, it is worthwhile to look in 

detail to the regional oceanographic features that influenced the life cycle of O. vulgaris in 

the study area.    

The Iberian Atlantic basin includes the western coast of Portugal and Spain. 

Considering the Estremadura Promontory (EP, 39ºN), the São Vicente Cape (CSV, 37º1’N; 

8°59’W) and Sta Maria Cape (CSM, 36°57’N; 7°53’W) as references, the continental shelf 

is relatively wide (50 – 60 km) with several canyons (e.g the Nazaré and the Aveiro 

canyon) and a steep slope northern to the EP. Here the freshwater contribution is 

significant due to the river runoff from the Tagus, Douro and Minho but also from other 

smaller rivers, lagoons and inlets in its northern limits (the Rías) (Peliz et al., 2005). South 

to the EP, the continental shelf is narrower (~25 km) with a moderate slope with no 

significant freshwater input (Peliz et al., 2005). The CSV marks the transition of the 

coastline orientation from west to south, here the Portuguese and Spanish south coast’s 

limit the northern boundary of the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC), the large bight that encloses the 

transition between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Between the CSV and the CSM, the 

shelf is narrow (~25 km wide), and east to the CSM it starts to widening till 40 km wide in 

the Spanish coast of the Gulf of Cádiz. East to the CSM, the continental shelf receives 



1. General introduction 

 

24 

 

important freshwater inputs from the Guadiana, Tinto, Odiel and Guadalquivir rivers (Pires 

et al., 2013).  

The entire Iberian Atlantic coast is under the influence of the Canary Current 

upwelling system, one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems (Arístegui et 

al., 2009) and comprises two sub-regional systems: The Western Iberia Upwelling System 

(WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS) (Peliz et al., 2005; Arístegui et al., 2009) 

where the mesoscale oceanographic processes are major factors controlling the ecosystem 

functioning in those regions (Relvas et al., 2007). 

The WIUS is a highly dynamic and productive system with marked seasonality that 

supports a complex food web (Bode et al., 2004). The predominantly equatorward winds 

observed in summer off West Iberia, drive an offshore Ekman transport and force the 

upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, sub-surface waters along the coast (Relvas et al., 2007). 

Here, during the late spring and summer, a narrow band of cold water of relatively uniform 

width is observed along the coast and small scale (20-30 km) perturbations are usually seen 

along the thermal front. This cold front is responsible for the formation of major filament 

structures than can extend more than 200 km offshore (Relvas et al., 2007). Those 

filaments can spread through the CSV to the east and influence the continental shelf 

circulation in the area between the CSV cape and the CSM. The filaments are responsible 

for exporting the new production offshore, although evidences show that the new 

production can be recirculated back in time scales of one month with interesting 

implications for the retention of fish larvae near shore (Relvas et al., 2007).  During winter, 

the Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) associated with the wind stress of south-westerly 

orientation dominates the WIUS system. The IPC increases its flow in September-October 

and persist in intensity till April. Nevertheless its influence do not reach the inner shelf, 

here the most important mechanism of forcing the shelf circulation is the wind stress. The 

prevailing winds in the west coast of Iberian Peninsula during winter are mainly south-

westerlies, and the atmospheric circulation is dominated by the eastward displacement of 

cyclonic perturbations and their associated frontal systems (Relvas et al., 2007). Several 

rivers drain in the west coast of the Iberian Basin, the contributions of the Tagus, 

Mondego, Douro and Minho, and the Galician rías feed the Western Iberian Buoyant 

Plume (WIBP). The WIBP is characterized by low salinities and is identified in winter sea 

surface temperature satellite imagery from its low temperature compared to the shelf 

waters and during summer the plume waters are warmer than surrounding waters. It 



1. General introduction 

 

25 

 

reaches its higher intensity during winter conditions when prevailing south-westerly winds 

generate an onshore Ekman component of transport, convergent to the coast and hence a 

saline front and the plume develops into a narrow (5–10 km) coastal current with strong 

poleward velocities (Relvas et al., 2007). Sardine and other fish larvae are distributed 

vertically in the upper 20 m, associated with the WIBP water (Santos et al., 2006). The 

surface stratification in the WIBP favours the optimal conditions for phytoplankton 

development (Ribeiro et al., 2005) and the development of high zooplankton biomass. 

Figure 1.3 shows the seasonality of both the Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) and the 

winds patterns in the northwest Portuguese coast based in data collected between January 

2000 and December 2009. 

 

Figure 1.3 - Monthly mean Sea Surface Temperature (sst), East-West component of Ekman transport 

(ekmanx) and north-south wind stress component (north_south_swind) obtained from the SST and wind time 

series registered along the Portuguese coast under the influence of the WIUS. The mean monthly SST and 

ekmanx were obtained from the data registered in two points along the Portuguese coast between January 

2000 and December 2009 (Source: NOAA ERDDAP database). 

The south Portuguese coast is under the influenced by the Gulf of Cádiz System 

(GCS). The GCS can be defined as a sub- system embedded in the large-scale Canary 

Current upwelling system (Arístegui et al., 2009) and its dynamic is highly influenced by 

this larger system. There are, however, two distinctive features that separates the GCS of 

the neighbors sub-systems: the coast orientation shift from north-south to west-east and the 

presence of the Strait of Gibraltar as the door to the Mediterranean. Here, the water masses 

exchange between the Atlantic and Mediterranean influences the large-scale circulation in 

the region. The meso-scale and inner-shelf circulation patterns are most influenced by the 

upwelling off CSV and the cold-water upwelling filaments from the eastern boundary, the 

runoff from the Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers mouth, the coastal counter-current, and 



1. General introduction 

 

26 

 

the east and west wind dynamic. The interaction between those oceanic processes and the 

coast topography results in distinct circulation patterns east and west of the CSM (García-

Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007) that influences the biological processes in the area. As in the 

western coast, the circulation is influenced by the seasonality of winds pattern and 

upwelling/downwelling events (Sánchez et al., 2006) (Figure 1.4). During the spring-

summer upwelling, the dominant westerlies winds resulted of a prevailing positive z-

component of the wind curl in the zone of the CSV create conditions to bring cold and 

nutrient rich water to east of CSM and producing a cell over the western shelf associated 

with the upwelling off CSV. Nevertheless, this cell is not strong enough to influence the 

circulation and bring biological material eastward. During downwelling relaxation events, 

the easterlies are stronger and the coastal counter-current flows beyond CSM and invades 

the western shelf, providing transport of biological material from the east to the west and 

the biological connection between both shelves. During winter, the east-west counter-

current and the east circulation cell are responsible for the introduction in the system of 

nutrient rich water from the Guadalquivir basin (García-Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2006).   

Despite the strong seasonality present in SST and wind pattern profiles (Ekman’s 

transport and west-east wind stress component) (Figure 1.4), the upwelling/downwelling 

strength is not as intense as in the northwest coast. The water column stratification is also 

responsible by the higher temperatures attained in the end of summer in the coast oriented 

to south.  

Both in the WIUS and the GCS, the retention and advection processes play the most 

important role in the control of the biological processes (Catalán et al., 2006). And this 

advection and retention processes are related with the seasonality of the wind patterns and 

upwelling/downwelling processes. In the WIUS, the seasonality of the 

upwelling/downwelling processes sets the pace of the biological cycles. Here, the duality 

between the offshore transport of the upwelling filaments and the retention processes 

associated to the IPC and the westerly winter winds mark the seasonality of the biological 

cycles (Arístegui et al., 2009) and sets the west coast of the Iberian Atlantic basin as the 

main spawning and recruitment areas for sardine (Sardine pilchardus, Bernal et al., 2007; 

Silva et al., 2009), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus, Murta et al., 2008) and for the 

marine invertebrates (Marta-Almeida et al., 2006; dos Santos et al., 2008).

(ekmanx) and East-west wind stress component  (east_west_swind) obtained from the SST and wind time 

series registered along the Portuguese coast under the influence of the GCS. The mean monthly SST and 

ekmanx were obtained from the data registered in two points along the Portuguese coast between January 

2000 and December 2009 (Source: NOAA ERDDAP database). 

 

In the GCS, the coastal orientation has a shadow effect in the upwelling conditions 

created by the prevalent northerly winds, and is the east-west wind pattern that controls the 

strength and influence of the two circulation cells east and west of the CSM. Here the 

biological cycles adapt to this east-west alternation. For instances, the anchovy Engraulis 

encrasicolus population in the northeastern area of the Gulf of Cádiz synchronizes its 

spawning cycle with summer to benefit of the warmer and rich waters and trophic regimes 

more suitable for the survival of the early stages in winter along the eastern basin (Ruiz et 

al., 2006). As in the northwest coast, here the advective and retention processes are 

essential to explain not only the larval distribution and abundance as well as the survival of 

early life stages (Catalán et al., 2006; Pires et al., 2013). For instances, decapod crustacean 

larvae distribution and survival is closely related with the circulation processes and 

alternation along the south Portuguese coast under the GCS (Pires et al., 2013).  

Nevertheless, while the oceanographic processes dominate the biological processes 

in the pelagic habitat, the benthic and demersal habitat suffer the influence of the 

continental shelf width or the bottom type. In their work Sousa et al. (2005) defined five 

species assemblages: shallow northern, shallow southern, intermediate northern, 

intermediate southern and deep. Those assemblages are associated primarily with depth 



1. General introduction 

 

28 

 

gradient and latitude, but coastal topography, bathymetry, coastal morphology, river runoff 

and currents also play an important role. In those assemblages, the seasonality is 

particularly important for the shallow assemblages (Sousa et al., 2005). The species 

richness in the demersal and benthic habitats is affected by the same factors (Sousa et al., 

2006) with the south coast presented higher species richness that the northwest coast, with 

species richness decreasing with the latitude increase. Being the latitude the main factor 

driving the decreasing gradient in species richness, this is a proxy of other factors with 

higher biological meaning as the shelf morphology, substrate characteristics, hydrology 

and oceanography, primary productivity and food availability. The narrower continental 

shelf associated to a higher productive area and shorter food web are the main factors that 

influence the low species richness of the northwest coast in relation to the south coast 

(Cunha, 2001; Sousa et al., 2006). 

 

1.4. ANALITICAL METHODS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR 
ECOLOGICAL STUDIES 

The O. vulgaris as other cephalopods, aside from being an important fisheries 

resource worldwide, has also an important ecological role in the marine benthic ecosystem 

as a predator of several species of fish, crustacean, molluscs and other cephalopods 

(Quetglas et al., 1998; Velasco et al., 2001; Smith, 2003). Their life cycle characteristics of 

fast growing, short life cycle and semelparity associated with the absence of known 

migratory patterns after settlement and their opportunistic feeding behaviour make of this a 

good model to assess environmental stability or shifts.  

While the classical biological studies of growth and spawning associated to relatively 

long time series allows to follow changes in the life cycle that are closely related with local 

environmental conditions and/or environmental shifts, the studies based in the use of 

biochemical tracers helps to define species habitat and can be used add trophic information 

to the ecosystem based models (Jackson et al., 2007). Defined as a predator of upper 

trophic level, O. vulgaris has the potential to be used to study habitats and food webs in 

relation to prey populations, oceanographic domains and environmental variability. 

The biochemical tracers more frequently used to characterize cephalopods habitat are 

the Fatty Acids (FA), mainly Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) but also the Stable 

Isotopes signatures (SIS), mainly the 13C/12C (?13C) and the 15N/14N (?15N).   



1. General introduction 

 

29 

 

The FA have been used as trophic markers since 1960's (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). The 

FA trophic markers (FATM), particularly PUFA are incorporated into consumers in a 

conservative manner, thereby providing information about predator-prey relationship not 

only in short-term but also over longer periods of time as FA are going to be sequestered in 

the predator reserves of lipid with time (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). Considering that most FA 

and particularly the PUFA are primarily produced by microalgae and zooplankton (Bergé 

&amp;amp; Barnathan, 2013; Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Piché et al., 2010) and the variations in the 

biomass, distribution and species composition of microalgae are driven by hydrodynamic 

processes, these environmental processes are ultimately influencing the basic pattern of FA 

in the marine environment (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). The second most important producers 

of FA are the herbivorous calanoid copepods that are in a central position within the food 

web linking the autotrophic organisms (phytoplankton and algae) and the second order 

producers (e.g. other zooplankton species as euphausiids and fish). These calanoid 

copepods feed on phytoplankton and also other copepods depending on food availability 

but also are able to biosynthesize monounsaturated FA (MUFA). The balance between 

different PUFA and between those and the MUFA in a specific moment or area is 

conservative through the upper levels of the food web and can be used as FA trophic 

marker (FATM) to assess the feeding conditions or productivity of a specific area or season 

(El-Sabaawi et al., 2008; Gonçalves et al., 2012), or being used to examine differences or 

changes in foraging patterns or diets, both within and between populations of predator 

species, without specifying what species are eaten (Budge et al., 2006; Iverson et al., 

2007).  

The FA profile in muscle and digestive gland of cephalopod species has been used to 

assess these species ecological role. In her work, Stowasser (2004) combined stomach 

analysis with analytical methods to determine the FA profile of muscle and digestive gland 

of several neritic and pelagic species of squids to validate the use of FA profile but also 

stable isotopes signatures as indicators of squids feeding history and habitat shifts. Using 

feeding experiments and samples of different locations, Stowasser proved that, although 

with some limitations, is possible to follow the feeding history of species with those 

analytical methods. In their work, Phillips et al. (2003a, 2003b, 2002, 2002, 2001a, 2001b) 

combined analytical methods with stomach content methods studying the feeding ecology 

in Moroteuthis ingens but also in other polar squids. Their studies showed that the 

cephalopods digestive gland is a rich source of fatty acid dietary tracers (Phillips et al., 



1. General introduction 

 

30 

 

2002) and can provide the history of dietary intake and indirectly give an image of the 

history of environmental conditions through the individual life history. In the same line, 

Rosa et al. (2004a) investigated the lipid content and FA profile in the digestive gland and 

gonad of immature and mature O. vulgaris and O. deffilipi. In their study, they did not 

found a close relationship between immature and mature gonads in both species, showing 

evidences that the gonad FA profile is more closely related with the food availability at that 

time that with prior feeding history.   

The stable isotopes signatures, the 13C/12C (?13C) and the 15N/14N (?15N) ratios are used 

here as complementary method to the lipid content and fatty acids profile giving 

information about trophic position and ontogenic changes of feeding habitat of O. vulgaris. 

The measurement of ?13C and ?15N of a consumer tissues in marine food webs provides 

important indications about the ecology of individuals and species and the trophic 

interactions within complex species communities (Hobson &amp;amp; Cherel, 2006a) as they reflect 

the consumers diet (Cherel and Hobson, 2005). Consumers are enriched in 15N relatively to 

their food in 2.5 ‰ to 3 ‰ (Vanderklift &amp;amp; Ponsard, 2003) and consequently the ?15N 

measurements indicate the consumer trophic position (Hobson &amp;amp; Welch, 1992). On the 

other hand, the ?13C vary little along the food chain but can be used to determine primary 

sources in a trophic network. The ?13C values indicate the lower versus higher latitudes 

plankton, and inshore versus offshore, or pelagic versus benthic contributions to food 

intake (Cherel et al., 2000).   

During several decades, the studies on food and feeding ecology of cephalopods 

were restricted to studies conducted in stomach contents (Sanchez &amp;amp; Obarti, 1993; 

Quetglas et al., 1998; Smith, 2003; Rosa et al., 2004b) or based on den ecology 

(Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verripoulos, 2004). However, stomach content analysis is time 

consuming and prey determination is often difficult because cephalopods tear prey into 

small pieces by their chitinous beaks and items are often too digested. Another major 

limitation is that stomach contents represent the last feeding events with no indication of 

long-term dietary habits (Jackson et al., 2007). 

Recently, several studies have been applying the stable isotopes signatures in 

cephalopods mainly squids (Takai et al., 2000; Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson, 2005; Hobson &amp;amp; Cherel, 

2006; Ruiz-Cooley et al., 2006; Stowasser et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009a) aiming to 

understand the role of cephalopods both as prey as well as predator in the marine food 

webs. Some of those studies investigate the contribution of squids to the diet of top

predators by investigating the stable isotope signatures in beaks found in the stomachs of 

sperm whales (Ruiz-Cooley et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009b) but many investigate the role 

of cephalopods as predators following the stable isotope signatures in both beaks and 

muscle (Takai et al., 2000; Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson, 2005; Stowasser et al., 2006). The study 

conducted by Hobson &amp;amp; Cherel, (2006) is particularly relevant. Here, the relationship 

between the isotopic signatures of prey and the beak and muscle of Sepia officinalis was 

assessed in a controlled environment experiment providing for the first time an estimate of 

isotopic discrimination between diet and hard and soft tissues of cephalopods (Hobson &amp;amp; 

Cherel, 2006). This study also proved that little or none discrimination between diet and 

tissue and that the differences found between beaks and muscle or between different beak 

regions are closely related with diet in a specific moment in the species life cycle and for 

that reason the stable isotope signature in the beaks can be used as life cycle recorder of the 

feeding and habitat, while the isotopic signature in muscle or flesh can be used as an 

indicator of present feeding behavior and habitat.  

 

1.5. OBJECTIVES  

O. vulgaris is one of the most studied marine species of the world. Important 

fisheries resource for Iberian and Mediterranean countries, potential candidate to 

aquaculture production, biological model for physiologic and behavior studies and 

emblematic species known by its intelligence and survival ability, the name O. vulgaris 

returns 1420 peer-reviewed papers in the web of knowledge database (724 in the last 10 

years).  

However, the O. vulgaris life cycle combining a pelagic paralarval stage with a 

benthic juvenile and adult stage, the high capacity to adapt to environmental conditions 

(plastic life cycle), the absence the of generations overlap and recruitment success highly 

dependent of the environmental conditions results in the necessity of study the adaptations 

of the population to the local conditions. Additionally, the paralarval dispersion processes 

and the grounds that offer the best settlement and growth conditions are still poorly known 

and appear to be quite variable. Lastly, the plastic life cycle characteristics result in highly 

variable growth rates and direct relationship between size and age has been difficult to 

address. This work addresses these three gaps in the knowledge about the O. vulgaris life 

cycle, particularly for the populations living along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian 

Peninsula. Under the influence of the coastal features of one of the four most productive 



1. General introduction 

 

32 

 

upwelling systems, the Canary Current upwelling system, the O. vulgaris population 

presents particular characteristics that makes of it one of the most resilient fisheries stocks 

for the coastal fisheries communities of Portugal and Galicia.  

In the chapter two, the O. vulgaris reproductive season and nutritional requirements 

of mature females are address under the light of the different environmental conditions 

experienced in the Portuguese northwest (under WIUS) and south (under GCS) coasts. In 

this chapter, we aimed to identify different reproductive strategies adopted by those two 

populations defined as different spawning seasons but also addressing different strategies 

between males and females. After defining these different spawning strategies depending 

of environmental conditions, was time to understand how different environmental 

conditions affect the nutritional quality of food and if this affects the nutritional quality of 

eggs using the mature gonads as proxies of eggs quality. Following the hypothesis that the 

environmental conditions and trophic habitat influence the biochemical composition of 

storage organs and the nutritional quality of the eggs, we followed the EFA profile and the 

content of total lipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of 

variations in the digestive gland and in immature and fully developed gonads of females of 

both populations. Here, the stable isotope signatures in the flesh and beaks were 

determined to set the trophic level of these octopus populations and proof the existence or 

not of differences in the trophic level of both populations. 

Chapter three addresses the habitat and diet requirements of the O. vulgaris 

paralarvae and juveniles. The Ría de Vigo, an inlet ecosystem in the western coast of 

Galicia is an important nursery for the O. vulgaris population of the entire northeastern 

Atlantic coast of Iberian Peninsula. Here, we characterize the local factors that confirm the 

Ría de Vigo as an essential fish habitat for the O. vulgaris northeastern Atlantic population. 

The settlement process is still poorly unknown due to sampling limitations but the survival 

of juvenile during and post-settlement is important to the recruitment to fisheries 

success.  For that reason, the identification of juvenile settlement and aggregation grounds 

is essential to an effective fishery management and to ensure sustainability of this heavily 

exploited species. Here, we aim firstly identify along the Portuguese coast areas where pre-

recruits of O. vulgaris aggregate, and secondly, to analyse the relationships between pre-

recruit abundance and several abiotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum 

habitat. The preferential preys of the O. vulgaris paralarvae have been recently identified in 

this area (Roura et al., 2012), nevertheless the nutritional requirements of this phase of the 



1. General introduction 

 

33 

 

life cycle, essential to successfully rear O. vulgaris paralarvae and complete the life cycle 

under culture conditions, is still under debate. Here, we determine the lipid content and FA 

profile of wild captured paralarvae and their potential prey. After hatch and feed in the 

shallow waters of the Galician and Portuguese coast, the paralarvae leave this habitat and 

travel along shore until attained the reasonable size to settle.  

The chapter four is dedicated to the ageing methods. It is generally accepted that the 

octopus, as generally all the cephalopods have a short life span of one to two years, 

nevertheless doubts arise when comparing senescent O. vulgaris with one kilogram and 

other with six kilograms of theoretically the same age. Well studied as a captivity animal, 

the pure observation of the animal in their natural status leads to conclude that the growth 

rate in captivity of controlled temperature and feeding at libitum hardly imitate the natural 

conditions. The latest achievements in determine age counting growth increments in the 

vestigial shell shows to be promising in the idea of determining age directly for this 

important resource. Nevertheless, an accurate and precise age determination needs to 

achieve the validation of different landmarks in the lifecycle of the individual as the hatch, 

the settlement of the onset of maturation. Considering this, firstly we aimed to develop a 

technique to locate the stylets in the muscle of paralarvae and to determining the stylet size 

at hatching as a reference to the nuclear area in the post-settled stylets. And secondly, to 

estimate the age of O. vulgaris juveniles (pre-recruits) of the Portuguese northwest coast 

(western Iberian upwelling system, WIUS) using SIA discussing the best methodology 

allowing to repeat and compare age estimates between populations and between Incirrata 

octopus species at the light of achieve higher precision in counts and closer age accuracy.

ABSTRACT 

Octopus vulgaris is an important fisheries resource, particularly in Iberian waters. Species life cycle is 

short with capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions and, considered a simultaneous 

terminal spawner. Data on maturation and other biological parameters collected from January 2007 to 

November 2010 are used to define spawning seasons for octopus landed by the small-scale trap fisheries 

in two oceanographically distinct Portuguese coastal areas: the northwest coast (western Iberia upwelling 

system) and the south coast (Gulf of Cadiz system). On a monthly basis, we followed the proportion of 

mature individuals, and the Gonad-Somatic and Hayashi Indices. Length-weight relationship, weight-at-

maturity, body condition and energy allocation were other biological parameters studied. Spawning 

season was markedly different in both areas. The northwest population spawns from March to July, in 

synchrony with the northwest coast upwelling season, and the south coast population spawns mainly in 

summer, between August and September. A less intense spawning peak in early spring is present 

occasionally in the south coast. Weight-at-maturity is geographically indistinct, but in both areas males 

mature at smaller sizes than females. Body condition increases significantly during maturation and mass 

allocation for reproduction results indicate that males and females channel energy to reproduction from 

several sources.

1.5.1. Introduction 

The common octopus Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier, 1797) is exploited as a target species by 

demersal trawl fleets and numerous small-scale fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and 

trammel nets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al., 2009). In 

2010, the Portuguese landings of common octopus in national ports were 12 602 tons (ten years 

average landings of 9 050 tons). The small-scale fleet, using traps and pots, is responsible for 

95% of the common octopus landings (ICES, 2011). Nevertheless, a growing interest in this 

species as well as in other commercial cephalopod species is presently noticed for the bottom 

trawl fleet, with 10% of the landings, in 2007 (Fonseca et al., 2008). 

Cephalopods are characterized by a plastic life cycle with a recognized capacity to adapt to 

different ecosystems, due to a short life span, high growth rate and diverse diets. O. vulgaris is a 

merobenthic incirrate octopod, common in temperate shallow habitats between the coastline and 

200 m depth (Roper et al., 1984; Boletzky, 1992). Due to its wide distribution, O. vulgaris is one 

of the best models to investigate the adaptation of reproductive strategies to specific 

environmental features.  

The species is characterized by a life span of one year in Saharan bank waters to two years 

in Galician waters attaining relatively large sizes, of up to 6000 g in weight and 25 cm mantle 

length (Domain et al., 2000; Otero et al., 2007). It is a simultaneous terminal spawner, laying on 

average 350 000 eggs in sheltered places between 20 and 120 m depth (Rocha et al., 2001; Silva 

et al., 2002). The spawning season is generally extended throughout the year with one or two 

peaks geographically variable in timing (Hastie et al., 2009). 

The Portuguese coast is a highly dynamic oceanographic region in the temperate northeast 

Atlantic, influenced by two important oceanographic systems the Western Iberia Upwelling 

System (WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS). The WIUS is characterized by a strong 

influence of the spring-summer coastal upwelling (Fíuza, 1983; Mason et al., 2005). The 

predominantly equatorward winds observed in summer, drive an offshore Ekman transport and 

force the upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, subsurface waters along the coast (Relvas et al., 

2007). The presence of the poleward current, responsible for the formation of convergence zones 

over the shelf-break, has an important ecological role for the retention and/or poleward transport 

of the phytoplankton (Ribeiro et al., 2005) and zooplankton (Santos et al., 2004), with 

zooplankton peaking in biomass during late spring and early summer near the outer-shelf 

(Cunha, 2001). All year round the coastal sea water temperature ranges between 14.4 ºC and 19.6 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

39 

 

ºC (Moreno et al., 2009) with a shallow thermocline developing during spring (Cunha, 2001). 

The south Portuguese coast on the other hand, is influenced by the GCS. The south coast 

orientation does not favour upwelling under northerly winds. Upwelling and downwelling events 

tend to be weak and the circulation is mainly wind forced and influenced by the local orography 

(García-Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007). The Cape Stª Maria (36º 57’N, 7º 53’W) divides the continental 

shelf in two, supporting different oceanographic processes (García-Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007). East 

to the Cape Stª
 
Maria, the presence of the Huelva front as a warm coastal current flowing along 

the shore, the significant fresh water runoff forming buoyant river plumes in spring, the 

occasional occurrence of the Stafford Shear, a cold-warm frontal region associated to local 

upwelling systems (Mason et al., 2005) and an extended Sea Surface Temperature (SST) range, 

between the 15.4 ºC and the 21.9 ºC (Moreno et al., 2009) are the main characteristics of the 

GCS.  

Studies on the reproductive features of commercially exploited marine species such as the 

common octopus are an important tool for the assessment of the stock status. Detailed 

information about the timing and the sites of spawning, size at maturity, and sex ratio at 

breeding, require a consistent assessment of the state of sexual maturity. These assessments 

usually involve several aspects of the reproductive development, such as the state of the gonad 

and the accessory reproductive structures, and are based on descriptive maturity scales and/or 

maturity condition indices (Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 2006). Due to the extensive distribution area of 

O. vulgaris and the commercial interest of the species in the Atlantic waters of the Iberian 

Peninsula, several studies have been conducted on the reproductive features of geographically 

distinct sub-populations. Based in her experiments in captivity Mangold (1983) reviewed all 

aspects of the O. vulgaris life cycle, and more recently other two reviews addressing O. vulgaris 

were published (Hastie et al., 2009 and Pierce et al., 2010), compiling recent advances on 

fisheries and life cycle aspects.  

Regarding specifically O. vulgaris reproductive aspects, several papers targeting 

Mediterranean, Iberian and other regional sub-populations have been published since the late 

70’s, with diversified sampling designs and methodology used to identify spawning season 

mainly based on proportions of mature individuals and several condition indices, such as Gonad-

somatic index or Hayashi index. Such studies rely mostly on landings from trawl fleets (e.g. 

Quetglas et al., 1998) and small-scale fleets (e.g. Sánchez &amp;amp; Obarti, 1993; Hernández-García et 

al., 2002; Fernandez-Rueda &amp;amp; Garcia-Flórez, 2007). A few studies were conducted with 

sampling designed specifically to O. vulgaris (e.g. Smith &amp;amp; Griffiths, 2002; Oosthuizen &amp;amp; 

Smale, 2003; Rodríguez-Rua et al., 2005; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verripoulos, 2006).  



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat

Considering its regional proximity and the methodology used, the studies of Silva et al. 

(2002) and Otero et al. (2007) are particularly relevant for the present study. In the Northwest 

Galician waters, Otero et al. (2007) define a single spawning season during spring (May to June) 

related with the seasonal coastal upwelling in Galician waters, despite the presence of mature 

females all year round. In those waters, males mature at smaller sizes than females and the mass 

transfer during the maturation process occurs directly from feeding sources. According to Silva 

et al. (2002), in waters of the Gulf of Cadiz, the reproductive season covers most of the year, 

with two distinct peaks in April/May and August/September. As in the previous study, males 

mature at smaller sizes than females. 

The present study aims to identify different reproductive strategies adopted by different 

populations, considering the distinct oceanographic features of the northwest coast within the 

WIUS and the South coast within the GCS. The reproductive strategies identified are described 

in terms of sex ratio, proportion of mature individuals and monthly mean gonad-somatic and 

Hayashi indices. At the individual level, length-weight relationships are determined by sex and 

area, as well as maturity ogives and the size effect at maturity. Additionally the effect of size and 

body condition is analyzed for each sex in both regions in order to identify sexual and regional 

differences regarding the use of storage mass for reproduction. 

 

1.5.2. Material and Methods 
 

1.5.2.1. Sampling  

Samples were collected monthly from January 2007 to November 2010 from the small-

scale trap fishery (Table 2.1) and frozen. Sampling sites were chosen considering the two 

different oceanographic regions, the Northwest coast, with Peniche as the landing port, and the 

South coast with Olhão as the landing port (Figure 2.1).  

For all individuals, the dorsal mantle length (ML in mm), individual weight (W in g) and 

digestive gland weight (DGW in g) were measured to the nearest 5 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. 

To assess maturation, the following data were collected: testis and ovary weight (TW and OW), 

Needham’s complex weight (NCW), oviduct weight (ODW) and oviducal complex weight 

(OCW), all weighed to the nearest 0.01g. A maturity scale of four stages for males (I: immature; 

II: maturing; III: mature; IV: post-spawning) and five stages for females (I: immature; II: 

maturing; III: pre-spawning; IV: mature; V: post-spawning) was used (adapted from Guerra, 

1975).

1.5.2.2. Data Analysis 

a) Sex ratio and spawning season  

Individual weight data aggregated in 200 g weight classes by study area were analyzed 

using RMIX, an algorithm designed to identify and separate normal distributions in size 

frequency distributions (MacDonald and Green, 1988; MacDonald, 2008). RMIX identifies a set 

of overlapping component distributions that give the best fit to the histogram. The modal weight 

classes, identified by visual inspection of the weight distribution, were used as the initial weight 

parameters. Constraints were applied in the analysis, such as a fixed variance coefficient for each 

component. Only components with n &gt; 50 were considered and all components were assumed to 

be lognormal. 

The sex ratio by month was estimated as the ratio between males and females. Significant 

deviations from 1:1 were tested by a ?
2
 test with ? = 0.05. In order to define the spawning season 

by study area, the proportion of mature individuals (MI) was determined monthly as: MIfi = 

(?Mi/Ni)f, with i as month, and M as the frequency of mature females, f (maturity stage III and 

IV) in each month; MImi = (?Mi/Ni)m, with i as month, and M as the frequency of mature males, 

m (maturity stage III) in each month. The spawning season was defined empirically as the 

sampling months in which MIfi &gt; 0.1 and MImi &gt; 0.1. 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

43 

 

Both the Gonad-somatic index (GSI) and the Hayashi index (HI) are important tools to 

assess the reproductive and maturation condition both at the individual and population level. The 

GSI, most indicated to assess the maturation condition in females (Guerra, 1975), was 

determined individually for all females in the form GSI  = OW*100/ (BW-OW) (Otero et al., 

2007). The monthly GSI was determined as the monthly mean of the individual GSI and 

analyzed separately for each study area. The HI, most indicated to assess the maturation 

condition in males (Guerra, 1975) was determined individually for all males in the form HI = 

NCW/(NCW+TW) (Otero et al., 2007). The monthly HI was determined as the monthly mean of 

the individual HIm and analyzed separately for each study area. The standard error was adopted 

as the measure of variability for the determination of the monthly mean of GSI and HI, and 

determined as SE = ?(Var(GSIi)/ni) or SE = ?(Var(HIi)/ni) with i as month (Zar, 1999). 

 

b) Length-weight relationship and weight-at-maturity 

The effect of both study area and sex in the length-weight relationship and maturity 

proportion was investigated with Scheffé F-tests at a significance level ? = 0.05. In order to 

normalize the data,  ML, W and MI by 200 g weight class were log transformed and compared 

with a two-way ANOVA test at a significance level ? = 0.05. 

Length-weight relationships for combined sexes as well as for all females and all males 

were determined by means of non-linear estimates by maximum likelihood of the form log (W) = 

a+b*log(ML). Goodness of fit was expressed by r
2
 and the significance level of the parameters 

estimated by a t-Student test.   

A maturity curve, for each sex in each study area, was fitted to the weight frequency 

distribution of the proportion (Pi) of mature individuals by 200 g weight class, with a logistic 

model: Pi = 1/(1+exp(?+?Wi) by weight class, i. Differences in the maturity curves between 

areas and between sexes were tested by means of the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for 

successive comparisons. The Weight-at-Maturity was defined as the weight class where 50% of 

individuals are mature and determined from W50% = -?/?. 

 

c) Body condition and energy allocation 

The body condition was determined for each study area for females and males separately, 

as the value of the residuals obtained from the geometric mean regression of log(BW) by 

log(BW)-log(OW) for the females, replacing log(OW) by log(TW) for the males. The residuals 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

44 

 

resulting from this analysis allow a comparison of individuals independently of body weight: 

positive residuals indicate animals that are heavier than predicted by the model, and negative 

residuals indicate individuals that weight less than predicted. Variations in body condition were 

compared by maturity stage using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s honesty significant difference 

HSD post hoc test (McGrath Steer &amp;amp; Jackson, 2004; Zar, 1999). 

To study the relative energy allocation, the variation in weight between organs in mature 

animals was assessed. Two geometric regressions were performed on mature individuals of each 

study area, for each sex separately: (A) the body weight vs. gonad weight and (B) the body 

weight vs. digestive gland weight, after log transformation. The residuals obtained from these 

two regressions, provide a size-independent estimate of the relative weight of the gonads and 

digestive gland. To determine if there is a mass transfer between organs during the reproductive 

process, the residuals derived from both regressions were compared to the body weight (W), the 

reproductive complex weight (OW+OCW for females and TW+NCW for males) and the 

digestive gland weight using the Pearson correlation test procedure (Zar, 1999).  

 

1.5.3. Results 
 

The weight of females ranged between 625 g (135 mm ML, maturity stage II, northwest 

coast) and 6189 g (247 mm ML, maturity stage IV, south coast). The weight of males ranged 

between 635 g (100 mm ML, maturity stage II, south coast) and 5612 g (248 mm ML, maturity 

stage III, south coast). The weight distributions were significantly different between areas

On the Northwest coast the weight distribution presents two modal peaks in the 1100 g weight 

class (modal weight, 1147 g) and in the 2200 g weight class (modal weight, 2216 g). On the 

South coast the weight distribution presents a mode in the 900 g weight class (modal weight of 

979 g) and another in the 1700 g weight class (modal weight of 1724 g)  (Table 2.1).

a) Sex ratio and spawning season 

The overall sex ratio (F:M) showed that in the Northwest coast sample, males are 

significantly more abundant than females, 0.88:1. In these samples, more males occurred in all 

months with the exception of April, October and November when the sex ratio was balanced 

towards females. On the other hand, despite the fact that the overall sex ratio on the South coast

was 1:1, females were more abundant than males except for the months of August, October, 

November and December, where the sex ratio was balanced towards males (Table 2.3).

Table 2.4 presents the proportion of mature individuals found by month in both sampling 

sites. In the Northwest coast, mature males were present every month with the exception of 

November 2007. For females, it is possible to identify a consistent pattern of a higher proportion 

of mature individuals (proportion mature &gt; 0.10) between early spring and late summer. In the 

south coast, no mature males were found in the samples in September 2008 and October 2008, 

between March 2009 and May 2009, and in September 2010 and November 2010. In this region, 

there was a non-negligible presence of mature females in late winter and earlier spring months of 

2007, 2008 and 2010, although the major proportion of mature females occurs in a single month 

in summer or late summer in each year.  

Considering the overall results, females in maturity stage I present a mean GSI of 0.198 (± 

0.004, SE), in stage II of 0.507 (± 0.022), in stage III of 3.947 (± 0.215), and for fully mature 

females (stage IV) of 9.134 (± 0.566), revealing a clear separation between maturing females and 

pre-spawning females. In males, the HI maturity index also presents increasing values from 

immature to mature males, with HI values of 0.357 (± 0.004) for stage II males, and 0.429 (± 

0.005) for stage III males, although in this case with overlapping extremes. For both maturity 

stages I and IV, not enough data were available for the determination of HI by maturity stage (n 

= 2 for maturity stage I, and n = 1 for maturity stage IV). 

In the northwest coast (Figure 2.3) females present higher GSI between early spring and 

summer, with two GSI peaks, during the studied period. After the second GSI peak, values 

decrease to near 0.1, comparable to the mean GSI for stage I. Regarding males in the northwest

coast, HI present higher values roughly between late winter and late summer, comparable to 

those of stage III males.

In the south coast (Figure 2.4), the plot of mean monthly GSI for females shows that there 

is a spawning peak in the summer or late summer months, although in adjacent months values 

are always high and near the average for mature animals, indicating the occurrence of mature 

females throughout the year. A secondary peak occurs in some spring months as is evident in 

March 2008 and June to July 2009. As for the HI of males, no specific season stands out for a 

higher proportion of mature specimens, although peaks are found in January 2007, from March 

2008 to July 2008, and from April 2009 to March 2010, indicating that mature males are present 

independently of the season.

b) Length-weight relationship and weight-at-maturity 

Length-weight relationship parameters by area and by sex as well as the statistical tests to 

the parameters estimated are summarized in Table 2.5. The ANCOVA analysis of the influence of 

geographic location and sex in length-weight relationships shows that the combined effect of 

both factors is significant (area : sex, F = 11.83, p-value &amp;lt;0.05), with the effect of the single 

factor area also being significant (F = 46.93, p-value &amp;lt;0.05) but not the effect of the single factor 

sex (F = 2.47, p-value &gt; 0.05), resulting in different length-weight relationships in each area, and 

for males and females in the northwest coast. In every case the increase in weight with length 

may be characterized as positively allometric (b &gt; 1).  



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

49 

 

Regarding weight-at-maturity, the Kruskal-Wallis one-factor analysis of variance shows no 

effect of geographic area of origin (?
2

Kruskal-Wallis = 0.20, p &gt; 0.05) but a significant difference 

between sexes (?
2

Kruskal-Wallis = 8.34, p &amp;lt;0.05). Considering each sex separately, the effect of 

geographic area was tested and a no significant effect of area was shown for both females 

(?
2

Kruskal-Wallis = 0.11, p &gt; 0.05) and males (?
2

Kruskal-Wallis = 0.003, p &gt; 0.05). Therefore there are 

only distinct maturity ogives for males and females with different values of weight at maturity, 

2548.01 g for females and 1577.54g for males (Figure 2.5).

c) Body condition and energy allocation 

In females, body condition increases significantly between the early maturation (maturity 

stage II) and late maturation (maturity stage III) (?stageII ? ?stageIII,, p &amp;lt;0.05).  Males also present a 

considerable increase in body condition between maturity stage II and stage III (?stageII ? ?stageIII, 

p &amp;lt;0.05) (Figure 2.6).  

 

Figure 2.6 - Mean body condition (±SE) with maturity stages. 

 

The Pearson Correlation index for female energy allocation shown by the size-independent 

digestive gland weight, evidences a negative correlation to individual total weight (-0.109, df 

=160, p &amp;lt;0.05) and to the weight of reproductive structures (-0.226, df =160, p &amp;lt;0.05). In the 

case of males, no significant correlation was found between the size-independent digestive gland 

weight and total weight or reproductive complex weight. Energy allocation shown by the size-

independent gonad weight evidences a negative correlation with total weight for both females (-

0.428, df = 261, p &amp;lt;0.05) and males (-0.256, df = 492, p &amp;lt;0.05), and similarly with the digestive 

gland weight (females: -0.256, df = 261, p &amp;lt;0.05; males: -0.412, df = 492, p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

1.5.4. Discussion 

 

The definition of different spawning seasons in octopus populations within relatively short 

distances off the Portuguese coast confirms the plasticity of environmental responses of the O. 

vulgaris life cycle, as observed in other cephalopods such as Loligo forbesi and Loligo vulgaris 

(Boyle et al., 1995; Moreno et al., 2005). In the northwest coast, females mature preferentially

51 

 

between early spring and summer in a long spawning season that encompasses two spawning 

peaks, one in February-April and another in June-July. In this region, mature males are found all 

year round and are generally more abundant in the fishery than females, due to the spawning 

behaviour of the latter, which decreases their availability at spawning. In autumn, the proportion 

of immature females in the population increases with a decrease of mature individuals, both 

males and females.  

In the south coast, the reproductive season occurs during summer peaking in September, 

despite the non-negligible occurrence of mature females during late winter or early spring, which 

would indicate that more favourable conditions could generate a secondary peak. Similar 

situations have been described for other populations in oligotrophic conditions as in the eastern 

Mediterranean waters and south-eastern coast of South Africa (Sanchez &amp;amp; Obarti, 1993; 

Oosthuizen &amp;amp; Smale, 2003; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verripoulos, 2006). Here, the overall sex ratio is 

balanced towards males, which seems particularly common in commercially exploited O. 

vulgaris populations (Hernández-García et al., 2002; Fernández-Rueda &amp;amp; García-Flórez, 2007; 

Otero et al., 2007). This variation in sex ratio, other than purely derived from the behavioral 

unavailability of females to commercial fisheries, has also been explained by a combination of 

different factors, such as different growth rates, migrations, feeding or post-spawning behavior 

(Mangold, 1983) although we have not found any study that indisputably proves the existence of 

ontogenic or reproductive migrations in populations of the common octopus.  

Our results seem to indicate that it is mainly the females that display environmentally 

adaptive reproductive strategies. In the Northwest coast where the ocean is more dynamic, the 

spawning season is extended over more than 6 months usually with two reproductive peaks 

similarly to the results of Hernández-García et al. (2002) and Fernández-Rueda &amp;amp; García-Flórez 

(2007) and Otero et al. (2007). In this area, the reproductive cycle of O. vulgaris, therefore 

appears to be highly connected with the long upwelling season as in other regions, such as the 

adjacent Galician waters and the Sahara Bank (Hatanaka, 1979; Demarq &amp;amp; Faure, 2000; Otero et 

al., 2007), synchronizing hatching with ideal conditions for food supply (Otero et al., 2008; 

Moreno et al., 2009) combined with reduced exchanges with offshore areas (Demarq and Faure, 

2000). Ecologically, the WIUS is characterized by a persistent nutrient and zooplankton 

shoreward transport (Almeida &amp;amp; Queiroga, 2003; Santos et al., 2004; Queiroga et al. 2007), 

favored by the westerly winds in late winter and spring, that create a continuous supply of food 

and potentiate the survival of two cohorts of paralarvae, hatching approximately four months 

apart, in July and November (Mangold &amp;amp; Boletzky, 1987; Otero et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 

2009).     



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

52 

 

In the South coast, where conditions are more stable but less productive, females 

concentrate spawning over a shorter period of time. The factors that trigger the onset of the 

reproduction seem to be related with the seasonal occurrence of favourable oceanographic 

conditions, such as higher temperatures and salinities, favoured by the easterly winds which are 

common during summer in the coastal areas close to Cape Stª Maria (Sánchez &amp;amp; Relvas, 2003; 

García-Lafuente et al. 2006). Ecologically, the GCS is a less dynamic and oligotrophic system, 

in which species tend to direct all of their energy onto a single spawning peak, such as in the case 

of the sardine Sardina pilchardus, the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and the wedge sole 

Dicologlossa cuneata (Baldó et al., 2006). In the case of the common octopus, individuals spawn 

in late summer, with the next generation hatching in winter, when the predominant westerly 

winds favor the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near to the Cape Stª Maria (García-

Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007).  

Actually, these differences of timing and spawning strategies adopted by neighboring O. 

vulgaris populations is also observed on the South African coast, where the southwest coast is 

bathed by the cold-water northward flowing Benguela Current producing long and strong 

upwelling events, and the southeastern coast is influenced by the Agulhas Current, a western 

boundary current that transports warm equatorial water pole wards (Gibbons et al., 2010). On the 

west coast, O. vulgaris females spawn throughout the year but mainly between spring and 

summer (Smith &amp;amp; Griffiths, 2002), and in the southeast coast, females spawn in summer, in a 

shorter and more intense spawning season (Oosthuizen &amp;amp; Smale, 2003).     

The length-weight relationship in the present study varies not only with sex but also with 

region, apparently reflecting environmental conditions. For the northwest region we determined 

different length-weight relationships for females and males, both positively allometric, but 

showing that males increase in weight faster than females (bmales &gt; bfemales). In the south coast, no 

differences were found in the length-weight relationship between sexes and both present lower 

increases in weight with length than either sex in the northwest coast. 

It is particularly interesting to note that in this study, geographic area is not reflected in 

maturity ogives, which may suggest that biological constraints could be imposing limits to 

minimum maturation body size, as occurs in other cephalopod species (see e.g. Boavida-Portugal 

et al., 2010 and Moreno et al., 2005). The weight-at-maturity for females is 2550 g and 1577 g 

for males. The differences found between sexes are probably linked with the simultaneous 

terminal spawning strategy, with females having to store reserves that are then mobilized to 

produce yolk, and for behavioral traits related to egg laying and protection. Additionally males 

probably reach maturity earlier in the life cycle, followed by an earlier decrease in growth rate 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

53 

 

(Mangold, 1983; Smith et al., 2005). However, weight-at-maturity registered for both sexes in 

our samples is higher than previously published for adjacent waters. In the northerly neighboring 

waters of Galicia, females mature at 1788.3 g and males at 903.4 g (Otero et al., 2007), and in 

the southeastern neighboring waters of the Gulf of Cadiz females mature at 2023 g and males at 

671 g (Silva et al., 2002). The differences found in the weight-at-maturity in different regions 

may be related with the sampling strategy followed by each author, since weight-at-maturity 

decreases at peak population maturity (Moreno, 2008) and thus the proportion of samples taken 

from peak reproduction seasons in relation to those obtained throughout the year affects the size-

composition of the sample of mature females. It can also indirectly result from the gears with 

which the samples were collected, since some gears are less likely to collect fully mature females 

(Fernández-Rueda &amp;amp; García-Flórez, 2007). It is therefore likely that there is high variability 

between individuals in any population and that sample characteristics, among which size and 

timing, may strongly influence the results. It seems reasonable to assume, and has been 

demonstrated, that maturity is first of all driven by a minimum weight limit and subsequently 

modulated by biological and environmental conditions. In our samples, there is a significant 

increase in body condition for both females and males between stage II (immature) and stage III 

(pre-spawning), indicating that the relative success of somatic growth in this pre-spawning stage 

may be crucial to determine subsequent events (McGrath Steer &amp;amp; Jackson, 2004; Otero et al., 

2007).  

Mass allocation data show that reserves are heading for reproduction in both sexes, 

although some differences can be found between males and females, in accordance with the 

studies conducted by Otero et al. (2007) and Rosa et al. (2004), and similarly to Loligo forbesi 

(Collins et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2005). Considering that males mature at smaller sizes than 

females, and can maintain this stage for several months until a female is available to breed, there 

seems to be a differentiated breeding strategy between males and females. Other studies, such as 

Gonçalves et al. (2002) and Rodríguez-Rua et al. (2005), additionally suggest that mature males 

are able to breed with immature females which receive and store the mature spermatophores 

inside the oviducal glands until the oocytes mature. However, only the mass transfer between 

organs was considered here, and this should be complemented by a study of the types of 

energetic nutrients that are transferred between organs.  

The present study has shown the potential influence and relative importance of 

environmental factors on the reproduction cycle of O. vulgaris, modulating timing, intensity and 

synchronism. Other studies have been constantly disclosing interactions that may improve our 

understanding of the main mechanisms. Nevertheless, in terms of population segregation, it

54 

 

seems evident that even under conditions of apparent genetic homogeneity (Cabranes et al., 

2008), populations subjected to fisheries in different geographic areas must be managed 

differently. And if we agree on the extent of its distribution pattern, O. vulgaris is one of the most 

diversely impacted cephalopods in terms of environmental exposure.

ABSTRACT 

This study aims to test whether environmental conditions including the trophic habitat and diet, impact 

the biochemical composition of storage organs and affect the nutritional quality of eggs of Octopus 

vulgaris. Trophic habitat and gonad quality of neighbouring populations off the Portuguese coast, subject 

to different oceanographic regimes, were compared using the digestive gland and beaks as recorders of 

trophic and habitat preferences, and gonads as indicators of egg quality. Cholesterol, phospholipids’ and 

triacylglycerol content, essential fatty acid (EFA) profile of the digestive gland and stable isotopes, ?
15

N 

and ?
13

C, in the buccal mass flesh and beaks were indicators of the differences in the trophic habitat 

between populations. For gonad quality, the same bio-indicators were used to identify differences with 

maturation. The study shows that, although diet influences the EFA profile of the gonads to a certain 

degree, the main lipid content, phospholipids and cholesterol content in the gonads are not influenced by 

habitat conditions. This therefore suggests that O. vulgaris is able to influence the quality of egg content 

independently of diet. The species is believed to be an income breeder which attains maturity upon 

reaching a sufficient condition level, then channelling energy directly from food to gonad development.

2.2.1. Introduction 

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier (1797) is an important fisheries resource 

and a key component of coastal food webs as a prey and generalist predator (Smith, 2003; 

Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verripoulos, 2004). The species is believed to channel energy to growth and 

reproduction directly from food (Quetglas et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011). It is a species with high 

feeding and turnover rates (Semmens et al. 2004), short life cycle and high plasticity to 

environmental conditions. Studies on the molecular and nutritional composition of reserve and 

reproductive organs reflect the benthic characteristics of the species. The habitat biodiversity and 

energy flow to which the populations are exposed are mirrored in the molecular and energetic 

composition of the tissues (e. g. Rosa et al. 2004a; Bandarra et al. 2006; Cherel et al. 2009; 

García-Garrido et al. 2010).  

The diet of O. vulgaris depends on the life-cycle stage, size, depth of occurrence, habitat 

and seasonal availability of their prey (Nixon, 1985; Smith, 2003). The cephalopod hepato-

pancreas or digestive gland has different functions in the physiology Octopus spp., including the 

synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes, the reabsorption and metabolism of nutrients; 

synthesis and storage of lipids like cholesterol, lipoproteins, glycogen, pigments, vitamins and 

protein-bound Fe, Cu, Ca and non-physiological heavy metals; and excretion and rejection of 

waste products of the digestion and cell metabolism (Blanchier &amp;amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984; 

Budelmann et al. 1997; Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp; Johnston, 2006). Its function as a storage organ 

indicates its utility as the ideal source of dietary tracers such as essential fatty acids (EFA) 

(Phillips et al. 2001) and dietary lipids (e.g. triacylglycerol and cholesterol) that are deposited in 

this organ with little or no modification of the lipid content (Boucaud-Camou &amp;amp; Boucher-

Rodoni, 1983; Phillips et al. 2003).  

Lipids are important dietary constituents, providing energy, vitamins and EFA. Cholesterol 

is the predominant sterol in the cephalopods lipids reserves (Sieiro et al. 2006) and proxy of the 

production of hormones in marine invertebrates (Kanazawa, 2002). The endogenous synthesis of 

cholesterol seems to be absent in cephalopods, suggesting that it is an essential dietary nutrient 

(Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). Triacylglycerol is a neutral lipid involved in fatty acid (FA) 

storage and metabolism (Lee et al. 2006).The FAs incorporated within the phospholipids act as 

building blocks for the membrane lipid bilayer (Athenstaedt &amp;amp; Daum, 2006; Bergé &amp;amp; Barnathan, 

2005; Dalsgaard et al. 2003). The triacylglycerol and phospholipids seasonal variability is related 

with cellular mechanisms under different environmental conditions and because of that, they are 

good indicators of condition (Shulman &amp;amp; Love, 2006). The most important EFA are arachidonic 

acid C20:4n6 (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5n3 (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3

(DHA). The requirements on ARA, EPA and DHA and the balance between them are important 

for growth (Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2000; Shulman &amp;amp; Love, 2006). These EFA are related with 

the energy channelling, the cellular membrane structure and function, and are integral elements 

of phospholipids as components of lipid bilayers (Tocher, 2010). 

Reproduction timing in O. vulgaris depends on the local oceanographic regime: a long 

season in productive systems, frequently with two reproductive peaks; and a shorter season (one 

to two months) in oligotrophic systems (Lourenço et al. 2012). The formation of the yolk is 

extremely important during maturation and egg development, because the newly hatched 

paralarvae are not truly lecithotrophic depending to some extent on these reserves to survive 

(Boletzky, 1975, Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). The nutritional content of the yolk is mainly 

protein, but lipids are also important for membrane formation and energetic supply (11-14% of 

dry weight) particularly the of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), phospholipids and cholesterol 

(Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2000). 

The ?
13

C and ?
15

N signatures in different tissues of a predator like O. vulgaris reflect its 

habitat and trophic position respectively (Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson, 2005). Consumers or predators are 

enriched in 
15

N relative to their food and consequently the ?
15

N measurement is an indicator of 

the consumer trophic position (Hobson &amp;amp; Cherel, 2006; Vander Zanden &amp;amp; Rasmussen, 2001).
 

With little variation along the food chain, the ?
13

C is used to determine primary sources in the 

trophic web indicating the habitat of the organism, and the inshore vs offshore, or pelagic vs 

benthic contribution of food intake (Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson, 2007; Jackson et al. 2007). The 

determination of ?
13

C and ?
15

N stable isotope signatures both in muscle and in cephalopod beaks 

are complementary approaches to stomach content and fatty acid analysis in studies of trophic 

dynamics and feeding ecology, permitting the identification of ontogenic migration and feeding 

shift events (Stowasser, 2004; Jackson et al. 2007). In species like O. vulgaris, diet studies are 

difficult to carry out due to the diversity of preys (Smith, 2003); the fast digestion rate (Boucaud-

Camou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983); and the large number of empty stomachs. For these cases, 

an analytic approach combining fatty acids and stable isotopes analyses provides overall 

information on the average diet regarding both trophic level and habitat of a particular 

population. 

Here we hypotheses that environmental conditions, including the trophic habitat, influence 

the biochemical composition of storage organs and the nutritional quality of the eggs (indirectly 

potentially affecting the next generation). The Portuguese coast presents an advantageous 

geographical setting where it is possible to follow O. vulgaris populations which are subjected to 

distinct environmental conditions: in the northwest coast, one of the populations is in a

productive system integrated in the Western Iberia Upwelling System (Relvas et al. 2007); in the 

south, the other is integrated in the Gulf of Cadiz System influenced by the oligotrophic and 

warmer waters of the Huelva front where downwelling and upwelling events are weaker and not 

seasonal (García-Lafuente et al. 2006). To test our hypothesis, we followed the EFA profile and 

the content of total lipids, cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of 

variations in the digestive gland and in immature and fully developed gonads of females of both 

populations. We also followed the ?
13

C and ?
15

N stable isotope signatures in the upper and lower 

beaks and buccal mass tissue of immature and mature individuals to identify the possible 

differences in the overall diet between population and maturity stages. 

 

2.2.2. Material and Methods 

2.2.2.1. Sampling 

 

All tissue samples were obtained from females captured in the small-scale O. vulgaris 

fisheries from March to April 2011 within the two study areas represented by landings in ports of 

Peniche (northwest coast area; lat: 39º 21.40 N, long: 9º 20.38 W) and Olhão (south coast area; 

lat: 36º 59.34 N, long: 7º 50.44 W). Within each area, five immature females and five mature 

females were selected and digestive gland tissue and gonads were collected, freeze dried and 

stored at -20ºC.  

Cleaned upper and lower beaks and buccal mass muscular tissue (referred as flesh 

hereafter) samples were collected from frozen animals and kept in 70% ethanol for isotopic 

analysis. Sampling was conducted considering the same explanatory factors, area and maturity in 

an unbalanced sampling design, collecting 27 flesh samples (4 mature and 6 immature samples 

in the northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature samples in the south coast) and 33 beak 

samples (8 mature and 9 immature in the northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature in the 

south coast). The dorsal mantle length and individual weight were measured to the nearest 5 mm 

and 0.1 g, respectively. Immature and maturing females were classified as immature whereas 

mature and spawning females were classified as mature (according to Guerra 1975).

2.2.2.1. Stable isotope analyses 

 

Beaks and flesh samples were freeze-dried and homogenized prior to analysis. To avoid the 

depletion of ?
13

C values due to lipids presence, flesh samples were rinsed successively in a 2:1 

chloroform-methanol solution (Cherel et al. 2005). Nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios were 

determined via Finningan conflo II interface to a Thermo Delta V S mass spectrometer coupled 

to a Flash EA1112 Series elemental analyser. Approximately 0.3 mg of each sample was 

combusted in a tin cup for the simultaneous determination of nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. 

Isotope ratios are presented in the usual ? notation relative to the PeeDee Belemnite (PDB) for 

carbon and atmospheric N2 (AIR) for nitrogen, and expressed as ‰. Replicate measurements of 

internal laboratory standards (acetanilide) indicate a precision of &amp;lt;0.2‰ both for ?
13

C and ?
15

N. 

The C/N mass ratio was used to check the effectiveness of the lipid extraction in the flesh and in 

the beaks (Post et al. 2007; Cherel et al. 2009). 

Prior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of normality and sample variance 

homogeneity were assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test, and Bartlett´s test, respectively. A paired t-

test was performed to assess possible differences in stable isotope signatures between upper and 

lower beaks. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the effect of 

area, maturity and the interaction between the two factors in the ratios ?
13

C and ?
15

N in the upper 

and lower beaks and flesh. The hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the 

assumption of: H0A: there is no main effect of the factor area on the stable isotope (?
13

C or ?
15

N) 

mean value in the beaks upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0B: there is no main effect of the 

factor maturity on the stable isotope mean value in the upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0C: 

there is no additive effect of the interaction between area and maturity on the stable isotope mean 

value in the upper and lower beaks and flesh. If H0C was rejected, a post-hoc Tukey test for 

multiple comparisons was performed to determine which combination of factors were 

significantly different (p-value &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

2.2.2.2. Lipid class analyses  

 

The total lipid (TL) fraction was extracted by the Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer (1959) method. Samples of 

? 1 g and ? 2 g of dry tissue of digestive glands and gonads were used respectively. The results 

were expressed as g lipid/100 g dry weight. Lipid classes were determined by different 

spectrophotometric methods. The phospholipids fraction was purified from the total lipid extract

according to Auborg et al. (1996). Total phospholipids were quantified by measuring the organic 

phosphorus in total lipid extracts according to the Raheja et al. (1973) method based on a 

complex formation with ammonium molybdate. Results are expressed as g PL/100 g dry weight. 

Total cholesterol was determined in the total lipids extracts by the method of Huang et al. (1961) 

based on the Liebermann-Buchardt reaction. Results are expressed in g cholesterol/100 g dry 

weight. FA composition of lipids present in the Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer extract was determined converting 

total lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), according to the method described by Lepage &amp;amp; 

Roy (1984). FAME were analysed by gas chromatography. Peaks corresponding to FAs were 

identified by comparison of their retention times with standard mixtures. Peak areas were 

automatically integrated with C19:0 being used as an internal standard for quantitative analysis. 

The concentration of each fatty acid or fatty acid group was expressed as g/100g total FAME.  

Prior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of normality and sample variance 

homogeneity were assessed with Shapiro-Wilk’s and Bartlett´s tests, respectively. Whenever 

these assumptions failed the data were log-transformed to guarantee normality and variance 

homogeneity. Two-way ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of area, maturity and the 

interaction between the two factors in the lipid classes in the digestive gland and in the gonad. 

The hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the assumption of: H0A: there is 

no main effect of the factor area on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0B: there is no main 

effect of the factor maturity on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0C: there is no additive effect 

of the interaction between area and maturity on the mean lipid class content in the tissue. If H0C 

was rejected, a post-hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine which 

factor combinations were significantly different.   

Major FAs were defined as those presenting concentration by area and by maturity stage 

higher than 1g/100g of FAME. For each FA, the assumption of sample normality and 

homogeneity was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk’s and Bartlett´s respectively by tissue and factor 

(area and maturity), when these assumptions failed, the variable was log-transformed. 

Differences in mean concentration of each FA between area and maturity stage were tested with 

t-test (Zar, 1999). The major fatty acids profile was compared by explanatory factor, area and 

maturity and the interaction between area and maturity by means of Multivariate ANOVA 

(MANOVA), followed by Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA).  The MANOVA and DFA are 

complementary approaches based in the separation of observation groups represented by their 

centroids obtained under the effect of two or more factors levels (Quinn and Keough, 2002). 

DFA is particularly useful to detect the variables that better discriminates between different 

observation groups (Zuur et al. 2007).

The mean individual weight of the females collected was 2340.30 ± 979.45 (SD) g in the 

northwest coast and 2637.40 ± 479.00 (SD) g in the south coast. Digestive gland and gonad 

presented different mean content in total lipids and lipid classes, with the digestive gland 

presenting higher mean content of total lipids, cholesterol and triacylglycerol (Figure 2.8). 

Despite that, the gonads were richer in phospholipids than the digestive gland (Figure 2.8).  

In the digestive gland the mean total lipid content and mean cholesterol content was 

depended on area. The digestive glands collected in the northwest coast presented a significantly 

lower content of total lipids (t = -2.42, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01), and higher mean content in 

cholesterol (t = 7.91, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01, see Figure 2.8) when compared with south coast. 

The two-way ANOVA for the interaction between the factors area and maturity showed 

significant differences in the mean content of cholesterol and triacylglycerol due to the additive 

effect of the two factors (Table 2.6).  

In the digestive gland, the fatty acids (FA) represented 31?g/mg and 46 ?g/mg of the total 

lipid content in the northwest coast and the south coast, respectively. The most abundant FA were 

the saturated fatty acids (SFA), followed by the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the 

monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (Table 2.7). The mean content of myristic acid, C14:0, 

palmitoleic acid, C16:1n7, gondoic acid C20:1n9, ARA, C20:4n6 and DHA were significantly 

different between areas, as well as the ratio DHA/EPA mainly due to the increase in DHA 

content in digestive glands of the south coast (Table 2.7). Results of the MANOVA analysis 

showed that content levels depend both on area and maturity, with no effect on the interaction 

between both factors (Table 2.8). In the DFA, the first discriminant function maximizes the 

differences between groups. The DFA for region groups show that the first function explained 

84% of the variability, with a good separation between the northwest coast group (class score = 

0.92) and the south coast group (class score = -0.92). The FA that contributed the most to the 

group separation was the DHA which was positively correlated with the south coast and 

negatively correlated with northwest coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a good 

separation between immature (class score = - 0.85) and mature digestive glands (class score = 

1.02) with 86 % of explained variation. The FAs that most contributed to the group separation 

were EPA and DHA and C18:0. The DFA for area x maturity groups (Figure 2.9, Digestive 

gland) showed a poor separation between groups with an explained variance of 51% in 

accordance with MANOVA results. Nevertheless, the FAs that contributed the most to the group 

separation were: DHA, positively related with immature females of the south coast area and 

negatively related with the immature and mature females from northwest coast: EPA, positively

2.2.3.2. Maturity 

 

Stable isotope signatures showed that the ?
13

C signature is statistically significant 

different with the maturity stage (Table 2.6), with the beaks of immature females 

presenting significant higher ?
13

C signature (Figure 2.7).   

The effect of different nutritional levels on maturity was studied by assessing 

differences in the digestive gland and gonads with maturity. For the digestive gland, there 

was no effect of this factor in the lipid classes content studied (Table 2.6). Total lipid, 

cholesterol and triacylglycerol content tended to increase from immature to mature females 

although this increase is not statistically significant. In relation to the phospholipid content, 

the digestive glands of mature females of south coast were significantly poor in 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

69 

 

phospholipids in relation to the immature ones (t = 3.50, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01) (Figure 

2.8). Nevertheless, when comparing the digestive glands lipid content between mature 

females of northern coast with mature females of south coast, some differences arose. 

Particularly, the total lipid content (t = -2.82, df = 18, p-value = 0.01), the cholesterol 

content (t = 10.52, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01) and the phospholipids content (t = 6.04, df = 

18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01) were significantly higher in the mature digestive glands of south coast 

(Figure 2.8).   

 Mature gonads of the northwest coast present higher contents in triacylglycerol, 

cholesterol and phospholipids, although no significant differences were found for the mean 

content of those bio-indicators between immature and mature individuals (Figure 2.8, 

Table 2.6). In the south coast, the gonads of mature individuals are significant higher than 

immature individuals in triacylglycerol (t = -2.86, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01) and 

phospholipids (t = 3.50, df = 18, p-value &amp;lt;0.01).  

The FA profile in the gonads was affected by area, maturity, and by the interaction 

of both factors (Table 2.8). Mature gonads were rich in SFA, showing the capacity to 

produce saturated fatty acids namely palmitic acid C16:0, increasing significantly from 

immature to mature females in the northwest coast.  In opposition, the stearic acid C18:0 in 

the northwest coast decreased from immature to mature gonads (Table 2.7). MUFA were 

the second most abundant fatty acids in the gonads, with the presence of vaccenic acid 

C18:1n7 as a minor FA, presenting significant differences between the northwest coast and 

the south coast namely in the FA C17:1 and C20:1n9. The FA C16:1n7 was significantly 

more abundant in immature than in mature gonads from the northwest coast. The PUFA 

represented between 9% and 13% of the FAME present in the total lipid content of the 

gonads, with the content in ARA, DHA and EPA decreasing significantly from immature to 

mature gonads in both study areas. In particular, the significant decrease in DHA in the 

northwest coast leaded to significant differences between the DHA/EPA ratio of immature 

and mature females in that area (Table 2.7). 

The DFA on the FA profile of the females’ gonads between areas showed that the 

first function explained 79% of the variability , with a good separation between the 

northwest coast group (class score = 0.82) and the south coast group (class score = -0.97). 

The FA that contributed the most to the group separation is the C18:0 which is positively 

correlated with the northwest coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a good 

separation between immature (class score = - 0.94) and mature individuals (class score = 



2. Reproductive cycle and nutritional habitat 

 

70 

 

0.79) with 74 % of the variability explained. The FA that contributed the most to the group 

separation was the C18:0, positively correlated to the immature individuals. The DFA for 

area x maturity groups (Figure 2.9, Gonad) showed a good separation between groups with 

an explained variability of 95% in concordance with MANOVA results. The FAs that 

contributed the most to the group separation were C16:0, 18:0 and ARA that were 

positively correlated with immature gonads from both areas.    

 

2.2.4. Discussion 

 

The ?
15

N and ?
13

C signatures in the flesh seem to be adequate short term indicators 

of diet and habitat. Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson (2005), working on Psychroteuthis glacialis, 

suggested that the difference between the ?
15

N of the flesh relative to the beaks relates to 

the chitin synthesis and consequent N accretion in the beaks. In the more recently formed 

regions of the beaks, such as the wing, the ?
13

C signature of the predator closely matches 

that of the prey (Hobson and Cherel, 2006), therefore also reflecting to an extent the recent 

dietary composition. The ?
15

N and ?

C of beaks are therefore used as indicators of habitat 

and diet preference (Post, 2002; Jackson et al. 2007). In our southern population of O. 

vulgaris, beak ?
13

C signature is different between maturity stages, probably a reflection of 

the recent trophic history of the different maturation stages. The higher ?
15

N ratio in the 

beaks from the south coast in relation to the northwest coast is probably related to the 

higher frequency of occurrence of crustacean prey (e.g. decapod crabs) found in the diet of 

O. vulgaris sampled (Lourenço, unpublished data). Rosa et al. (2004b) show that the 

decapod crabs are important prey of the O. vulgaris populations along the Portuguese coast 

and the presence of crustacean prey in the diet of Loligo forbesi is known to increases the 

?
15

N content of the beaks and flesh of that species (Stowasser 2004). Darnaude et al. 

(2004) relate increased ?
15

N to a significant input from river plumes, through the added 

input of ?
15

N rich particulate organic matter. This however does not appear to be the case 

of our study, since river input is more important on the west than on the south coast.  

Considering that the digestive gland is mainly a lipid reservoir and therefore has a 

high lipid content, it is the ideal organ to trace fatty acids as diet bio-indicators (Phillips et 

al. 2001;  Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp; Johnston, 2006; García-Garrido et al. 2010). In our study the 

total lipid content ranged between 14.60 % in northwest coast immature females, in line 

with values obtained by Rosa et al. (2004a), and 24.42 % in south coast mature females.

Contrary to what might be expected for a nutrient rich area, the digestive glands of the 

northwest coast population present relatively low lipid content in comparison to the south 

coast population, in particular of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. This is probably related 

to nutrient seasonality. In March and April the pre-upwelling conditions in the northeast 

coast determine a low fat content in sardine Sardina pilchardus (Bandarra et al. 2006) and 

horse-mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Bandarra et al. 2001), while on the other hand 

phytoplankton peaks in the south coast are common in early spring associated with the 

warmer and nitrogen rich river plumes. Conditions in the south are then relatively 

favourable to the development of earlier phytoplankton blooms dominated by 

dinoflagellates  (Navarro and Ruiz, 2006; Crespo et al. 2012), which is corroborated by the 

higher relative content in ARA, EPA and DHA produced by the community of primary 

producers (Dalsgaard et al. 2003). 

 The high digestive gland content of C18:1n9 (? 11 % in both study areas), which is 

indicative of deep waters prey species, and C16:0 (? 20% in both study areas) which is 

indicative of the presence of herbivorous preys, actually suggest a diverse diet (Piché et al. 

2010). Comparing both areas, the DHA/EPA ratio is exceptionally low in the north-western 

population. According to Dalsgaard et al. (2003), the DHA content should be higher 

relative to the EPA for a carnivorous species. In their study Rosa et al. (2004b) observed 

the possibility of a carnivorous preys on the northwest coast, while this study highlights a 

dominance of a carnivorous preys towards the south coast. A higher triacylglycerol content 

in the South can in addition be related with the dominance of crustacean preys (Phillips et 

al. 2003) in the diet of the population of this area, which is also suggested by the ?
15

N and 

?
13

C of the beaks. 

It is therefore likely that during the period in analysis the diet of the south coast 

population had a relatively higher dominance of crustacean prey, those in turn recently fed 

on lipid-rich plankton. 

As in the squids Sepioteuthis lessoniana and Photololigo sp. (Semmens, 1998), or 

the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Blanchier &amp;amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984), the lipid class 

contents in the digestive gland do not correlate directly with the lipid contents of the 

oocytes in the gonad, especially for total lipid content, triacylglycerol and phospholipids 

(see Figure3.8).The lipid class contents of the digestive gland of mature females shows 

significant differences between regions but this regional difference is not found in the 

gonads of the same females, which seems to indicate that the factors triggering oocytes

maturity are independent of the nutritional value of reserves, even though females 

generally reach maturity beyond the optimum body mass and independently of gonad size 

(Lourenço et al. 2012). As income breeders that channel the energy directly from food to 

the gonad during maturation (Houston et al. 2006; Quetglas et al. 2011), the different 

levels in triacylglycerol and cholesterol noted in the O. vulgaris digestive glands between 

geographical areas should be expected to show in the gonads as a reflection of diet. Despite 

that, only the gonad fatty acid profile presents significant differences related with both area 

and maturity stage evidencing that the composition changes as maturation progresses but 

also that there are differences between areas at every stage of the process. The gonads of 

the south coast are richer in PUFA and in MUFA and the gonads of the northwest coast are 

richer in SFA especially C16:0 and C18:0. Nevertheless, the differences found in the ratio 

DHA/EPA between areas are marginally insignificant (t = -1.86, df = 18, p-value = 0.08), 

indicating a low impact of trophic habitat in the quality of oocytes. These results partially 

agree with the results obtained by Farías et al. (20115). In that study, the authors found a 

direct effect of diet in the DHA/EPA ratio for the Patagonian red octopus Enteroctopus 

megalocyathus, here, although FA profile in the gonads revealed different between areas, 

the contents in DHA, EPA or DHA/EPA ratio are identical between the studied areas. 

In conclusion, this study shows that, despite the variability observed in the stable 

isotopic signatures studied, ?
15

N signature in beaks is a valuable bio-indicator to follow the 

diet history of different O. vulgaris populations, and the ?
13

C signature has potential to 

assess feeding behaviour changes related with maturity in O. vulgaris females. 

Furthermore, specific lipid classes as the triacylglycerol and the cholesterol and its content 

in the digestive gland can be used as indicators of their nutritional availability in the local 

habitat. The fatty acid profile is a good indicator of both nutritional availability in the 

environment and also of gonads quality as shown by the main EFA content and the 

EPA/DHA ratio. The environmental availability of these EFA depends on seasonal cycles. 

Upwelling/downwelling events for example determine changes in the lipidic contents of 

the plankton and in turn of the prey of octopus, as evidenced by the higher total lipids and 

cholesterol content in the digestive glands of the animals from the south coast. In spite of 

their characteristics as income breeders, it is difficult to observe a direct relationship 

between the lipid class contents in the digestive gland and in the gonad, suggesting that a   

measure of regulation is exerted between food intake and oocyte formation.

3.1. THE RÍA DE VIGO OCTOPUS VULGARIS SPAWNING GROUND: LOCAL 
FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF 

PARALARVAE 
 

 

ABSTRACT 

The Ría de Vigo (Southwestern Galicia) is an important spawning ground for the Octopus vulgaris 

population of the north-western Atlantic coast. The large-scale oceanographic conditions that are 

linked to the abundance and distribution peaks of the paralarvae have been extensively discussed. 

Nevertheless, the local micro-scale factors that favour the paralarvae concentration in Ría de Vigo 

have been less well studied. With this study, the correlation between local variables on O. vulgaris 

paralarvae abundance were analysed. The correlation of water column depth, distance from coast, 

and zone were analysed during the season of higher paralarvae abundance (the autumn). Our results 

have shown that the depth of the water column and the distance to the coast have a significant 

correlation with the paralarvae abundance. The importance of those results is discussed under the 

insight of the role of the Ría de Vigo as an essential habitat for the O. vulgaris population of the 

northwestern Atlantic coast.

3.1.1. Introduction 

Octopus vulgaris is a neritic benthic species, common in the coastal waters between 

shore and approximately 100 m depth (Mangold, 1983). Its distribution extends to the edge 

of the continental shelf but most animals aggregate in the coastal waters at a relatively 

short distance from the coastline (Quetglas et al., 2000). The paralarvae are pelagic from 

hatching to settlement (Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008), and this transition to the juvenile 

benthic life style depends biologically on feeding opportunities (energy input) and 

environmentally on the local temperature (Villanueva, 1995; Faure et al., 2000; Iglesias et 

al., 2004). The choice of the ground to settle depends of the dispersal of the paralarvae 

during the pelagic phase, but bottoms of large grain sediments, namely gravel and coarse 

sand, and the proximity to rocky reefs appear to be beneficial to the juvenile and sub-adult 

recruitment success (Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2004; Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008; 

Moreno et al., 2014).  

Different environmental factors (e.g. sea surface (SST) and bottom (SBT) 

temperatures, depth, water-column stratification) have different impacts in O. vulgaris 

survival and growth. The level of impact depends of the life cycle stage following 

important shifts in each life cycle transition (see Robin et al., 2014 for a review in life 

cycle transitions). Nevertheless, in the case of O. vulgaris, the degree of influence of 

environmental (mainly oceanographic) conditions is considered to be higher during the 

paralarval stage affecting the present generation recruitment to fisheries (Otero et al., 2008; 

Roura et al., 2013). In the last fourteen years several studies have been conducted to 

understand the effect of the oceanographic parameters on the distribution and abundance of 

O. vulgaris paralarvae in the vicinities of important fishing areas. Those studies have been 

targeting the effect of large and meso-scale indicators such as sea surface temperature 

(Demarcq &amp;amp; Faure, 2000; Moreno et al., 2009) or coastal upwelling (Faure et al., 2000; 

Gonzalez et al., 2005; Otero et al., 2008, 2009), but few have been conducted on the 

environmental conditions at the local scale as in situ temperature, water column 

stratification, bottom characteristics or distance to the coast line.  

The coastal areas, particularly those in the vicinity of important estuaries, or those 

featuring large inlets (e.g. Northwest Spanish coast) are considered important spawning 

grounds and nurseries for most of the exploited marine fish and invertebrate species (Able, 

2005; Pallas et al., 2006; Vasconcelos et al., 2008; Morais et al., 2011). Larvae and

juvenile stages of several species grow in these areas to the adult stage, then often 

undergoing ontogenic migrations to different habitats (Able, 2005).  

For marine invertebrate species with complex life cycles, with pelagic phases that 

carry out medium- or large-scale dispersion movements and benthic phases of limited 

mobility, the definition of nursery ground is more complex (Stoner, 2003; Pallas et al., 

2006). These species depend on larval dispersion to enhance survival and the definition of 

a nursery ground should add temporal (e.g. season) and physical dimensions (e.g. 

temperature, dispersion currents, water column stratification) to the spatial factors (e.g. 

sediments, depth).  

Shallow inlets such as the "Rías" are structurally complex environments where many 

biotic (e.g. predation, food availability) and abiotic factors (e.g. physical disturbance) 

determine habitat quality and generate different stress gradients that determine community 

structure and population dynamics (Pallas et al., 2006). The most important stress 

gradients impact at the micro (meters) or meso-scales (hundreds of meters or kilometers) 

and as a response to this variability, benthic organisms might select their habitat to reduce 

the trade-offs among different stress factors (Pallas et al., 2006).  

The identification of essential habitat (essential fish habitats, EFH) for O.vulgaris 

requires knowledge about how environmental and biological factors affect the survival of 

pre- and post-settlement juveniles both at the micro-scale and meso-scales (Moreno et al., 

2014). Considering this, the aim of this study is to assess the local effect of some factors 

(water column depth, zone and distance to coast) in the abundance of O. vulgaris 

paralarvae in the spawning grounds around the Cies Islands, in Ría de Vigo.  

 

3.1.2. Material and Methods 

To determine Octopus vulgaris paralarvae abundance near the Cies islands, a survey 

was conducted using a 750 mm diameter bongo net of 375 µm, equipped with a 

mechanical flowmeter (Figure 3.1). Sampling was conducted at night in four transects and 

two tows per transect at 2 knots. The tows were conducted during 20 min near surface 

(between 10 and 15 m depth) according to the depth strata of higher abundance of 

paralarvae (see Otero et al., 2009 and Roura, 2013 for methods).

Mean abundance (n/1000 m

) of O. vulgaris paralarvae were determine by transect 

and compared considering the factors transect water column depth (depth), distance to the 

Cies Islands (dland) and sampling zone (zone). Sample abundance results were tested for 

the assumptions of normality and homogeneity with Shapiro-Wilk’s and Bartlett´s tests, 

respectively. The main effects and interaction between the factors depth, dland and zone on 

the mean abundance were determined by two-way ANOVA with permutation test, re-

sampling the original data 10 times to generate a sampling distribution F against which to 

test H0 and obtain a probability measure. The hypothesis for the two-way ANOVA was that 

there is no main effect of depth, dland and zone and no interaction effect of depth × dland, 

depth × zone and dland × zone on paralarval mean abundance. The existence of 

collinearity between factors was assessed by determining the spearman correlation index 

(rspearman), assuming that two factors were collinear when rspearman was significantly higher 

than 0.90.

The average abundance (n/1000 m

 ± SD) of O. vulgaris paralarvae was determined 

by transect (Table 3.1). Higher paralarval abundance was observed in station inn_1 in the 

inner zone (19.73 ± 4.32 n/1000

 ) followed by station out_2 close to the outside part of

the islands in the Ría de Vigo. The lower average abundance occurs in the more distant 

transect of outer zone, out_1 with 0.92 ± 1.30 n/1000
3
. 

Despite the differences found, there is no statistical evidence that the outer zone and 

the inner zone present significantly different levels of paralarval abundance (Table 3.2). 

The transects both sides of the Cies islands presented higher abundances than the more 

distant transects (out_2 and inn_1 transects) (Table 3.1), this relationship observed between 

the average abundance of paralarvae and the vicinity of the Cies Islands is proved with the 

ANOVA results for the factor dland in Table 3.2. 

The shallower transects (out_2 and inn_1) were the ones where paralarval average 

abundance was higher. Those differences were confirmed by the ANOVA results, 

presenting statistical differences between transects with different water column depths. It is 

important to note here that the factors dland and depth are not collinear (rspearman= 0.44, p-

value = 0.27).

The two-way ANOVA results on the interactions between the three factors show that 

those interactions have a significant effect on the abundance of the paralarvae (Table 3.2 

and Figure 3.2). Despite the fact that the factor zone had not a significant effect on the 

paralarvae abundance, the inner zone of the Ría de Vigo is associated with shallower 

waters that were associated with the higher abundances of O. vulgaris paralarvae (Figure 

3.2), clearly benefiting of the barrier and protection effect of the Cies Islands.

3.1.4. Discussion 

The analysis conducted here showed that additionally to SST, physical disturbance or 

productivity, there are local factors as the water column depth and the distance to the coast 

that have an important effect in the distribution and abundance of paralarvae, at least at the 

local scale. 

All of the paralarvae captured here and the majority of the paralarvae captured in 

previous studies conducted in the same study area (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Roura, 2013) 

show 3 suckers on the arms and weigh on average 2.5 mg indicating that they are newly 

hatched (Villanueva 1995; Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008; Roura, 2013) and confirming this 

area as a spawning ground. During the autumn hatch peak (our sampling season), Roura 

(2013) described the dispersion mechanism of paralarvae from this area. According to his 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile

work, during September/October upwelling conditions, the paralarvae concentrate in the 

surface waters and are washed out from the inlet due to the offshore currents. This is, 

probably, the mechanism responsible for “feeding” up some of the winter juvenile (pre-

recruits) grounds identified by Moreno et al. (2014). 

 According to Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman (2008) most benthic octopus species with 

pelagic paralarvae spawn in shallow rocky or coral substratum areas, and consequently 

their hatchlings are more abundant near the coastline. 

 This link between important spawning grounds, feeding grounds (or nurseries) and 

favorable transport conditions was also identified by Garofalo et al. (2010) for the O. 

vulgaris population of the Strait of Sicily. There, the spatial distribution of the O. vulgaris 

spawning grounds and nurseries is controlled by the meso-scale eddies that favor the 

migration of the paralarvae to south-western feeding grounds. The circulation is further 

modified by the formation of meso-scale eddies, which appear to control the spatial 

distribution of the spawning and nursery grounds of O. vulgaris in the strait of Sicily. 

Spawning octopuses concentrate in the northern and central sectors of the Strait of Sicily at 

the margin of fronts or eddies, the presence of which favors larval retention and benthic 

settlement, promoting the formation of nursery areas close to the spawning grounds 

(Garofalo et al., 2010). 

In the present study, we show that the Cies Islands influence the abundance of the 

paralarvae inside the Ría de Vigo system. The Cies Islands possibly act as a barrier and 

protection for the O. vulgaris breeding females and consequentially for the newly hatched 

paralarvae wich have limited swimming capacity. Here, the paralarvae start to feed mainly 

of zoeae (Roura et al., 2012) of decapod species of the families Paguridae, Palaemonidae 

and Procellanidae which live in these shallow inlets (Lindley, 1982; Sampedro et al., 1997; 

Valdés et al., 2007). 

The functional role of the Ría de Vigo as a nursery is not fully understood because 

few or no paralarvae with more than 3 suckers per arm (sucker number at hatching, 

Villanueva, 1995) have been found in the several studies conducted until now. 

Nevertheless, there is evidence (Guerra pers comm) of mature females looking for shallow 

grounds in the surroundings of the Cies Islands to spawn. Furthermore, Otero et al. (2008) 

and Roura et al. (2013) found out that the local environmental conditions as wind stress 

and the strength of downwelling/upwelling events prior and during hatch in this region 

highly explains the abundance and biomass paralarvae abundance and particularly the

year-to-year variability of the adult catches for the entire Galician coast. Additionally, 

comparing the studies conducted by Moreno et al. (2009) and by Roura (2013), the 

abundances obtained by the latter for the Ría de Vigo (a maximum abundance of in Out_2 

transect of 395 n/1000
3
 m in 2008) seem to be higher than the abundances estimates 

obtained by the former for the entire portuguese coast (maximum abundance in autum in 

the north coast of 6 n/100
3
) for a 18 years survey data.  

Although oceanic features appear to be the main driving forces that explain why Rías 

Baixas is an important spawning ground, this preliminary study showed that at the local 

level other factors determine the abundance of newly hatched O. vulgaris and these may 

also contribute to explain why this area can be considered an EFH to the Northwestern 

Atlantic coastal population of O. vulgaris.

ABSTRACT 

The Iberian Atlantic coast and particularly the Rías Baixas (Southwestern Galicia, Spain) constitute 

an important spawning ground for Octopus vulgaris. Unfed hatchlings of O. vulgaris were directly 

collected by scuba diving from wild ripe eggs in the Ría de Vigo in Rías Baixas. At the same time, 

plankton samples were collected in the same area to capture wild paralarvae and their potential 

prey. The calorimetric analytical methods were used to assess the nutritional quality 

(carbohydrates, proteins and lipid classes content) of unfed hatchlings, planktonic paralarvae and 

their potential prey aiming to interpret the nutritional requirements of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae. 

Multivariate analyses show that O. vulgaris hatchlings are richer in carbohydrates (and glycogen), 

proteins, total lipids, cholesterol and phospholipids although maintaining the protein:lipid ratio of 

their potential prey. The fatty acids (FA) content was also determined and compared between unfed 

hatchlings, planktonic paralarvae and potential prey to understand if there specific FA were 

incorporated by the planktonic O. vulgaris through their diet. There are differences in the n-3 

Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (HUFA) content, with mesozooplankton samples being richer in 

C22:6n3 (EPA), poorer in C20:5n3 (DHA) and also in C20:4n6 (ARA) than hatchlings and 

paralarvae. The planktonic paralarvae have an FA profile markedly different from that of the 

hatchlings and mesozooplankton, being particularly rich in C16:1n7, C18:1n9 and ARA, 

evidencing their capability to biosynthesizing Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Considering that few 

days of life separate the O. vulgaris hatchlings from the planktonic paralarvae, the observed 

changes in O. vulgaris FA profile occur in a relative small step of time, thus showing that their 

natural prey greatly influence specific FA enrichment. This kind of selective enrichment could be 

carried out under culture conditions in order to enhance survival during the first critical days. 

Keywords: Octopus vulgaris, paralarvae, prey, fatty acids, diet profile.

3.2.1. Introduction 

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an important resource for the artisanal 

and industrial fisheries in the Atlantic margin of the Iberian peninsula, with official average 

annual landings of 9185 tons in Portugal (INE, 2013) and 4000 tons in Galicia (Gonzalez 

et al., 2005). In 2011, the Portuguese artisanal fleet was responsible for 95 % of the 

common octopus landings in this country (ICES, 2011). Landings statistics also show the 

increasing importance of common octopus in catches of the trawling fleet in recent years 

(ICES, 2012; Fonseca et al., 2008; Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). O. vulgaris is also 

considered one of the species with most aquaculture production potential due to its high 

growth and high food convertion rates (Vaz-Pinto et al., 2004). Nevertheless, there is a 

bottleneck in the transfer of knowledge to an industrial scale  because of the high mortality 

rates prior to settlement in captivity, even after the cycle has been closed. This is believed 

to be due to feeding and nutritional constrains at the paralarval stage (Iglesias et al., 2007).     

O. vulgaris is defined as an “r” life-history strategy organism with the production of 

numerous small eggs that hatch into pelagic paralarvae (although not strictly, due to the 

maternal egg care). The factors responsible for the recruitment success in cephalopods are 

most dependent on the interaction between egg masses, hatchling and pre-recruit juveniles 

and the physical and biological environment prevailing during each phase (Gonzalez et al., 

2005); sea temperature playing an important role (Forsythe, 2004). In the north-east 

Atlantic, the O. vulgaris population is characterized by a bimodal life cycle with an 

extended reproduction phase with two spawning peaks, one in early spring and another in 

late summer (Otero et al., 2007; Lourenço et al., 2012) resulting in two hatching peaks in 

July and September/October (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2009) and two 

recruitment peaks in coastal areas (Demarcq &amp;amp; Faure, 2000) linked with the seasonality 

and strength of the seasonal coastal upwelling of the Western Iberia (Demarcq &amp;amp; Faure, 

2000; Otero et al., 2008, 2009).  

The Iberian Atlantic coast is known as a hatchery and nursery area for Octopus 

vulgaris (Moreno et al., 2014), and the Rías Baixas in the Galician coast are believed to be 

particularly important (Otero et al, 2008). Here as in the coastal waters, the dynamics of 

the coastal upwelling/downwelling events favours the cross-shelf dispersion of O. vulgaris 

paralarvae (Moreno et al., 2009; Roura, 2013). After hatching, O. vulgaris paralarvae 

remain pelagic for 2 to 4 months, depending on the temperature, contributing to the 

mesozooplankton community (Villanueva, 1995; Demarcq &amp;amp; Faure, 2000; Katsanevakis &amp;amp;

Verriopoulos, 2006). In the first days of life, O. vulgaris paralarvae combine endogenous 

(yolk) with exogenous (prey) feeding (Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). Using molecular 

methods, Roura et al. (2012) concluded that the main preys of O. vulgaris paralarvae, at 

least in this region, are larval stages of decapods of the families Crangonidae, Alpheidae, 

Brachyura, Paguridae, Thalassinidae and Porcellanidae, followed by euphausiids and fish 

larvae (Roura et al., 2012). With the exception to the euphausiids, all the species detected 

contributed less than 4,3 % to the abundance of the mesozooplanktonic community in this 

region, suggesting that O. vulgaris paralarvae are specialist predators in the wild (Roura et 

al., 2012).  

The mesozooplankton community is a key component of the coastal ecosystems, 

linking the microbial food web to the macrozooplankton and neritic food webs. In the Rías 

Baixas (Galicia), the mesozooplankton community is closely linked to the 

upwelling/downwelling events associated to the Western Iberian Upwelling System, where 

primary production is increased by wind-driven currents that bring nutrient-rich sub-

surface water up into the photic layer during the spring/summer coastal upwelling events 

(Relvas et al., 2007; Álvarez-Salgado et al., 2009). In this region Roura et al. (2013) 

identified 3 mesozooplankton communities following the bathymetric gradient, named as 

coastal, frontal and oceanic. These communities differed in both species composition and 

abundance, and are influenced by the regional meteorology and hydrography.    

Despite the extended knowledge about the environmental physical factors that drive 

the distribution, abundance and recruitment success of O. vulgaris paralarvae (González et 

al., 2005; Otero et al., 2008, 2009; Moreno et al., 2009; Roura 2013), there is a gap in 

studies regarding the feeding requirements of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae and the 

nutritional profile of their natural preys. The studies conducted to date were undertaken on 

reared eggs and individuals in captivity, showing that an O. vulgaris paralarva weighs 

about 1.4 mg at hatching with approximatelly 80% of water (Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2003; 

Villanueva, 1995) and protein (between 46 % and 69 % of the dry weight). Lipid classes 

are minor nutrients accounting for 12 % of the paralarva dry weight, mainly cholesterol 

and polar lipids (phospholipids) (Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2003; Villanueva et al., 2004).  

Accordingly, our study aims to identify the composition profiles of O. vulgaris 

paralarvae collected from wild ripe eggs (unfed hatchlings) and the nutritional profiles of 

their potential preys present in the mesozooplankton (species bigger than 1 mm) of the Ría 

de Vigo. The profiles were assessed in terms of lipid classes (phospholipids, cholesterol, 

triacylglycerol, wax esters and fatty acids profile), proteins, carbohydrates and glycogen

content. Condition indices and trophic markers based in the protein, lipids and fatty acids 

(FA) classes (Saturated, Polyunsaturated, PUFA and Highly Unsaturated) were determined 

and compared between potential preys and O. vulgaris hatchlings to understand the 

nutritional requirements of the paralarvae. Additionally, we follow the variation in the FA 

profile between unfed hatchlings and older paralarvae aiming to understand which FA were 

incorporated into planktonic O. vulgaris hatchlings through their diet, in order to 

understand their nutritional requirements for aquaculture.  

 

3.2.2. Material and Methods 

3.2.2.1.  Zooplankton sampling 

Mesozooplankton samples were collected at the surface (5 m depth) with a 

multitrawl (MultiNet®) sampler (0.71 × 0.71 m opening frame, 200 µm mesh) in three 

surveys conducted under the LARECO project (CTM2011-25929) in autumn 2012 

(September 17th, October 1st and 5th) in the outer part of Ría de Vigo (Figure 3.3). 

Samples were collected east (inner sample) and west of Cies Islands (outer sample). 

Zooplankton samples were visually examined on board, looking for Octopus vulgaris 

paralarvae. Up to 40 O. vulgaris paralarvae were found and stored at -80ºC in a solution of 

Methanol: Dicloromethane (2:1) solution for analytical purposes. Samples with paralarvae 

were split into two subsamples. One was washed with sea water and filtered through a 

1000 µm sieve to retain individuals larger than 1000 µm (considered hereafter as the 

potential prey of O. vulgaris paralarvae), frozen at -80ºC, freeze dried for 48 h and stored 

again at -80ºC for further analysis. The second subsample was stored in 70% ethanol and 

used to identify the mesozooplankton community accompanying the paralarvae. Organisms 

were identified under a binocular (Nikon SMZ800) or inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse 

TS100) to the lowest possible taxonomic level. To determine the base biochemical profile 

of the O. vulgaris paralarvae, newly hatched paralarvae were obtained from ripe eggs 

collected by scuba diving in October 9
th

 2012 off the Ría de Vigo (site coordinates: 

42º14’N, 8º 54’W) (Figure 3.3). The hatchlings were counted and pooled in three samples 

for biochemical analysis.

3.2.2.2. Biochemical methods 

Proteins, carbohydrates, total lipids and the lipid classes phospholipids (phos), wax 

esters (wax), cholesterol (chol), triacylglycerol (tag), free fatty acids (ffa) and fatty acids 

(FA) were determined from the samples.  

The protein content was determineded through the method of Lowry et al. (1951) 

after alkaline hydrolysis with 0.5 N NaOH at 30°C for 24 h. Bovine albumin (Sigma), 

which underwent the same treatment as samples, was used as a standard.  

Carbohydrates were quantified according to the phenolsulphuric acid method 

(Strickland and Parsons, 1968) using glucose as the standard. Glycogen was quantifieded 

through the same assay as carbohydrates, after sample precipitation with 100 % ethanol.  

Lipids were first extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:2) and after centrifugation, 

the precipitate was re-extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1). Both supernatants were 

subsequently washed with chloroform:methanol:water (8:4:3) as described by Fernández-

Reiriz et al. (1989). Total lipids were quantified following the method described by Marsh 

&amp;amp; Weinstein (1966) with a tripalmitine standard (Sigma Aldrich Inc., Buchs, Switzerland). 

Lipid classes were studied by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)/densitometry. Silica gel 60 

W plates (Merck 16486) of 20 × 20 cm by 0.25 mm in thickness, were used. Samples were 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile

applied by an automatic TLC sampler (Camag 27220). The chromatographic stain was 

made according to Freeman &amp;amp; West (1966). The plates were stained with a 10% CuSO4 

solution in 0.85% H3PO4 by heating to 180ºC (Bitman &amp;amp; Wood, 1982). Standards 

employed for the quantitative analysis of the sterol and waxes esters, sterols, free fatty 

acids and triacylglicerol were cholesterol, palmitate, cholesterol, palmitic acid and cod 

liver (CLO, Sigma), respectively. A standard obtained from a natural sample was used for 

phos. The plates were scanned with a Shimadzu CS9000 densitometer, using a 

monochromatic 370 nm beam of 0.4 × 0.4 mm working in the zigzag mode, reading the 

whole spot, and with automatic autozero for baseline correction. All solvents, reagents and 

fatty acid standards used in this work were of analytic grade (Merck, Darmstadt, and 

Sigma). 

The results of the biochemical analyses, expressed in units of weight per individual, 

were transformed into their energy equivalents using the following factors: 18, 17.2 and 35 

KJ/g for protein, carbohydrates and lipids, respectively, based on Beukema &amp;amp; De Bruin 

(1979). 

The FA composition of the total lipid fraction was determined converting total 

lipids into FA methyl esters, according to the method described by Lepage &amp;amp; Roy (1984). 

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were analysed by gas chromatography. Peaks 

corresponding to FAME were identified by comparison of their retention times with 

standard mixtures. Peak areas were automatically integrated with C19:0 being used as an 

internal standard for quantitative analysis. The concentration of each fatty acid or fatty acid 

group was expressed as g/100g total FAME. 

Nutrient and FA ratios are used as biomarkers of condition (Shulman &amp;amp; Love, 

1999) and represent the trophic position or dietary quality of a species population (e.g. El-

Sabaawi et al., 2008). The content in saturated FA (SFA), Monounsaturated FA (MUFA), 

polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) including n-3 Highly Unsaturated (n-3 HUFA), n-6 HUFA, 

Docosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3 (DHA), Eicosapenteonoic acid C22:6n3 (EPA) and 

Arachidonic acid C20:4n6 (ARA) are particularly important to determine biomarkers of 

condition. Here were determined the protein:lipid, tag:lipid, n-3 HUFA:n-6 HUFA, 

SFA:PUFA; DHA:EPA and the DHA:ARA ratios for mesozooplankton and O. vulgaris 

hatchlings and paralarvae. Although the number of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae collected 

form the zooplankton samples was apparently high (n=40), their low weight prevented us 

from carrying the whole biochemical analyses and only FA profiles could be obtained.

3.2.2.3. Statistical analysis 

The species composition and abundance of zooplankton samples, macronutrients, 

lipid classes and FA profiles were analysed using metric multidimensional techniques. 

Prior to analysis, the zooplankton database was log (x+1) transformed and screened to 

select those taxa that appeared in at least 10% of the samples. A zooplankton dissimilarity 

matrix was calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Zuur et al., 2007) and 

analysed with principal coordinate analysis (PCO). The dimensions (axes) eigenvalues and 

species scores in each dimension of a full model were used to reduce the matrix size to the 

species that most correlate with the PCO axes in a reduced model (Table 3.3). The 

macronutrients and lipid classes content dataset was normalized according to Zuur et al. 

(2007). The similarity matrix was calculated based in the Euclidean distance matrix (Zuur 

et al., 2007) and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA). The groups separated 

by PCA were tested for differences related with sampling area and species composition by 

non-parametric permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA).  

The FA profile database was screened to select the major FA (of which the mean 

content is &gt; 1g/100g FAME) and data were normalized according to Zuur et al. (2007). 

The FA similarity matrix was calculated based in the Euclidean distance matrix (Zuur et 

al., 2007) and further analyzed with PCA. The dimension (axes) eigenvalues and FA scores 

in each dimension of the full model were used to reduce the FA matrix size to the FA that 

explain most of the variance in a reduced model (Table 3.3). Both zooplankton species and 

FA profile reduced models were tested for differences related with sampling area and 

species composition by non-parametric permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA) 

considering type I errors.  

A constrained canonical analysis (CCA) was applied to the zooplankton reduced 

model using the macronutrients, lipid classes and FA as explanatory variables to identify 

significant correlations between the content of those nutrients and the zooplankton species 

composition and abundance in each sample. The CCA was conducted on the site scores of 

the species composition reduced model, applying the macro-nutrients and lipid classes 

content as explanatory variables in the nutrients model; and the FA's content as explanatory 

variables for the FA model. The analysis was conducted applying the “envfit” function of 

the VEGAN package in R (Oksanen et al., 2013). 

The macronutrients, lipid classes and FA profile of zooplankton and O. vulgaris 

paralarvae (unfed hatchlings and feeding paralarvae) were compared using PCA to 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

96 

 

determine which FA could differentiate between the groups and then, the arising groups 

were tested with PERMANOVA. The CCA was used to assess the correlation between 

different  groups, the condition indices (protein:lipid and tag) and trophic markers 

(SFA:PUFA; n-3 HUFA:n-6 HUFA; DHA:ARA; DHA:EPA) studied.

3.2.3. Results 

Specific composition of the zooplankton with size &gt; 1 mm (Table 3.4) showed a 

dominance of holoplankton species both in the inner zone (67.65 %) and the outer zone 

(83.61%) with the copepods Paracalanus parvus and Acartia clausii, and the euphausid 

Nyctiphanes couchii being the most frequent species. The meroplankton species 

contributed with 32.35 % in the inner zone and 16.39 % in the outer zone, with the most 

frequent larvae being cirripids and brachyuran zoeae, mainly in the inner zone stations. The 

mean holo/meroplankton ratio of the &gt; 1 mm fraction of the zooplanktonic community 

ranged between 2.12 in the inner zone and 6.33 in the outer zone indicating that the two 

sampling groups belong to the same coastal community. The similarity observed between 

inner and outer zone groups was confirmed by the PERMANOVA for differences between 

sampling zone (F = 1.57, p-value 0.25, 199 perm). Although differences between areas 

were not significant, the PCO on the zooplankton reduced model allowed the samples to be 

separated considering the presence and abundance of species in two different groups: the 

copepod group that aggregates the samples dominated by the copepods species (samples 

out_d1, out_d2 and inn_d2); and the zoeae group which aggregates the samples for which 

the larval stages of crustacean, Cnidaria and Siphonophora and the copepod Temora 

longicornis are the most important species (samples inn_d1, inn_d3 and out_d3) (Figure 

3.4, zooplankton reduced model).  

The zooplankton samples are rich in protein and total lipids, with a Protein: Lipid 

ratio of 2.99. Lipids are the second most abundant nutrient and an important energy source 

(7.50 KJ/g) (Table 3.5 - Macronutrient composition and energy content of the zooplankton samples and 

Octopus vulgaris hatchlings. Different superscripts indicate significant statistical differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) 

between studied groups. * indicates a significance level of  p &amp;lt;0.05 between groups;  ** indicates a 

significance level of  p &amp;lt;0.01.), with tag being the most abundant lipid class, followed by the 

ffa and waxes (Figure 3.5). Individual FA average concentration (g/100g FAME ± SD) 

obtained by GC are presented in Table 3.6. The zooplankton fatty acids profile was 

analysed with PCA and results show that the first and second dimensions explained 81% of 

variation due to the Myristic acid C14:0, Palmitic acid C16:0, Palmitoleic acid C16:1n7, 

Margaric acid C17:0, C17:1 and Vaccenic acid C18:1n7 variation between groups (Table 

3.3).

C17:1 is highly correlated with zoeae, Cnidaria and Siphonophora species, and that the 

DHA is closely related with the copepods samples group (marginally significant).

The macronutrient content of O. vulgaris hatchlings shows that the paralarvae are 

rich in protein (43.23 %DW) and lipids (12.06 % DW) with an average Protein: Lipid of 

3.65 (Table 3.5). For the lipid classes’ content, O. vulgaris hatchlings are rich in 

phospholipids and fatty acids, followed by cholesterol and a very low content in ffa. No tag 

and waxes esters were detected (Figure 3.5). 

Both macronutrients and lipid classes content are statistically different between 

zooplankton samples and hatchlings with the latter being richer in carbohydrates (and 

glycogen), proteins, total lipids, chol and phos (Table 3.5, Figure 3.5). PCA shows that the 

different macronutrients and lipid classes content allow zooplankton samples to be 

separated from O. vulgaris hatchlings, explaining 92 % of the model variation (Figure 3.6: 

nutrients model) further supported by PERMANOVA (F = 8.86, p-value = 0.025, 199 

perm). The canonical constrain analysis shows that the nutrients that better explain the 

separation between zooplankton and hatchlings are tag (r

waxes (r

the FA C20:4n6 and FA C20:3n3 have the same retention time, and the concentration of FA C20:4n6 is dominant in 

marine products, the concentration presented here is representative of C20:4n6. 

 

Comparing O. vulgaris hatchlings (with embryonic yolk) with the zooplankton, most 

FA show different concentrations with the exception of lignoceric acid C24:0 (minor 

concentration FA), erucic acid C22:1n9, nervonic acid C24:1n9 and linoleic acid C18:2n6. 

Some FA were only identified for O. vulgaris hatchlings as oleic acid C18:1n9 and 

eicosadienoic acid C20:2n6 (a minor concentration FA), and others were only identified for 

the zooplankton community such as ?-linoleiric acid C18:3n3 and eicosatetraenoic acid 

C20:4n3. The overall FA profile is significantly different when comparing zooplankton 

samples and O. vulgaris hatchlings (PERMANOVA, F = 266.79, p-value = 0.03, 199 

perm). The biplot in figure 3.6 showed that the first axis explained about 98 % of the 

variation observed and the zooplankton samples are correlated with higher content of

short-chain C14:0, C16:1n7 and the family of denatured stearic acid C18:0 with exception 

of C18:1n9 that was only detected in O. vulgaris hatchlings. The O. vulgaris hatchlings are 

particularly rich in the long-chain fatty acids erucic acid C20:1n9, docosapentanoic acid 

C22:5n3 and ARA. 

 

Figure 3.6 - Biplots of principal component model of macro-nutrients and lipid classes profiles (nutrients 

model) and the fatty acids profile (Fatty acids model) comparing zooplankton samples and Octopus vulgaris 

hatchlings. The vectors represent the most correlated variables obtained in the canonical constrained analysis. 

Legend: out_d1, out_d2, out_d3, inn_d1, inn_d2 and inn_d3 represent the zooplankton samples and 

hatchlings represents the O. vulgaris hatchlings samples. The codes in grey represent the nutrients scores 

(nutrients model) and the fatty acids names (fatty acids model). 

The condition indices (Protein: lipid) and trophic markers (SFA: PUFA, n-3HUFA: 

n-6HUFA, DHA: EPA and DHA: ARA) showed that in terms of protein: lipid ratio, the 

protein content was three-fold the lipid content in the zooplankton compared with the 

hatchlings. The ratio n-3 HUFA: n-6 HUFA is twice as large in the zooplankton community 

than in O. vulgaris hatchlings, which influences in the same degree the DHA: ARA ratio. 

O. vulgaris hatchlings are richer in DHA in comparison with the EPA content (DHA: EPA 

ratio &gt; 1) (Table 3.7). Those conditions indices and trophic markers were compared with 

the nutrients (macro-nutrients and lipid classes) and with the fatty acid profile of 

zooplankton samples and O. vulgaris hatchlings as explanatory variables of the observed 

fatty acid profile. Results show that those can be used to differentiate between samples 

(Figure 3.6), particularly the tag content, n-3HUFA: n-6HUFA, DHA: EPA and DHA: ARA 

(blue arrows in Figure 3.6 FA model) and tag content (blue arrow Figure 3.6 nutrients 

model).  

Table 3.6 presents the fatty acids profile identified in the sample of 40 O. vulgaris 

paralarvae collected from the plankton. Some of the minority (&amp;lt;1 g/100g FAME) FA 

identified in O. vulgaris hatchlings were not identified in the planktonic paralarvae. It is 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile

noteworthy that C16:1n7 and C18:1n9 content is particularly high in the paralarvae in 

comparison both with the hatchlings and the zooplankton samples. The ARA content is 

identical in both hatchlings and paralarvae and higher than in the zooplankton samples. 

The DHA content of paralarvae is identical to that of the zooplankton and lower to that of 

the hatchlings. EPA content in wild paralarvae is particularly low in comparison with the 

other groups (Table 3.6). Overall, planktonic O. vulgaris have increased concentrations of 

MUFAs and lower concentrations of PUFAs when compared with the hatchlings. The PCA 

reflects those differences separating the planktonic paralarvae from hatchlings and 

zooplankton samples, mainly based in the differences in the content of Oleic acid (Figure 

3.7). The PERMANOVA results showed that the FA profile is different between these three 

groups in terms of both FA identified and FA content (F = 119.5, p-value = 0.005, 199 

perm). The trophic markers (blue arrows in the Figure 3.7 biplot) are highly correlated with 

axis 1 (95 % explained variation), indicating that differences found in these trophic 

markers ratios are more significant between O. vulgaris samples and mesozooplankton 

samples than between hatchlings and feeding paralarvae.

3.2.4. Discussion 

The zooplankton species identified represent a small time and size window of the 

mesozooplankton community of the Ría de Vigo during the season of higher O. vulgaris 

abundance. In the western Iberian Atlantic coast, O. vulgaris paralarvae hatch 

preferentially in September/October in synchrony with the higher levels of food and energy 

availability as a result of the previous spring/ summer upwelling (Gonzalez et al., 2005). 

O. vulgaris paralarvae start to feed from some hours to a few days after hatching 

(Villanueva et al., 1996; Roura et al., 2012), hunting preferentially on crustacean species 

larger than 1mm in length, which coincides with observations documented in captivity (e.g. 

Villanueva et al., 1996; Hernández-García et al., 2000, Iglesias et al., 2006; Roura et al., 

2010). Accordingly, we analysed as potential prey for O. vulgaris only the zooplankton 

species that were larger than 1 mm. It included a heterogeneous assemblage of organisms 

such as cnidarians, appendicularians, siphonophores, crustaceans, chaetognaths, 

polychaetes, echinoderms and fish larvae. Although O. vulgaris paralarvae appear to be 

specialist predators feeding preferentially on decapod crab larvae (Roura et al., 2012), we 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

106 

 

included the entire zooplankton assemblage to understand what was the nutritional profile 

of the community. 

Our samples were dominated by two copepods Paracalanus parvus and Acartia 

clausi, the euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchii, chaetognaths and small Tunicata (see Table 

3.4). In spite of their abundance, copepods were not detected in the gut contents of the 

early stages of octopus (Roura et al., 2012), but these organisms may constitute an 

important part of the diet of the paralarvae later in their planktonic stage (Roura et al., 

2013), as studies in captivity show that O. vulgaris feds on copepod species in absence of 

other preys (Iglesias et al., 2007). Additionally, the identification of the species 

composition in our samples linked with the FA profile, permitted the identification of the 

source of some of the most limiting FA for the optimal growth of O. vulgaris paralarvae 

such as DHA (Monroig et al., 2012a) which is biosynthesized by the more abundant 

copepod species (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Bergé &amp;amp; Barnathan, 2005).  

The lipid classes content in the zooplankton community denotes a rich source of 

phospholipids and free FA that can be easily incorporated by the O. vulgaris paralarvae and 

fuel their high growth rates. Furthermore, this earlier autumn zooplankton community is 

richer in tag than wax esters, which is characteristic of a community that experienced a 

peak of food availability (phytoplankton) (Lee et al., 2006). The higher content in tag 

relatively to wax esters is also related with the increasing presence of the meroplankton 

species in some samples, particularly cirripedes and brachyuran larvae that are known to 

store tag in large lipid globules (Lee et al., 2006), in opposition to the copepod dominated 

samples richer in wax esters from PUFA (Lee et al., 1970, 1971). 

  The zooplankton community FA profile showed a dominance of the saturated FA 

(SFA) and the polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). This is related with the dominance of calanoid 

copepod species but also due to the sampling season. In this season there is a higher 

availability of bacteria, detritus and green algae in the water which are richer in short-chain 

SFA (Falk-Petersen et al., 2002) ando n which the zooplankton feeds, influencing the high 

content in SFA (~ 30%) and PUFA (~ 49 %) (Falk-Petersen et al., 2002; Gonçalves et al., 

2012). 

The biochemical profile and nutritional ratios determined for O. vulgaris hatchlings 

allowed predicting the nutritional requirements during the paralarval stage (Sargent et al., 

1999). O. vulgaris hatchlings collected here are particularly rich in carbohydrates (and 

glycogen), proteins and phos, with proteins comprising the major energy source for 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

107 

 

hatchlings individually (see Table 3.5 and Figure 3.5). Navarro and Villanueva (2000, 

2003) already showed that newly hatched and older O. vulgaris paralarvae in captivity,  are 

relatively low in lipid contents with relatively large phos and chol fractions and small lipid 

reserves (e.g. tag). Other early stages of cephalopod species such as Galiteuthis glacialis 

show the same pattern (Piatkowski &amp;amp; Hagen, 1994). 

On the other hand, these O. vulgaris hatchlings depend on the inner yolk rich in 

lipoproteins to survive through the first hours of life (Boletzky, 2003; Lee, 1991; 

Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). The digestive gland is not fully developed (Moguel et al., 

2010) and paralarvae get energy from the lipoproteic yolk rich in phosp and chol (Lee, 

1991) which explains the relatively high content of those nutrients. Tag and waxes are only 

vestigial in content and were not quantified by the method employed. We believe that tag 

and waxes had been greatly consumed due to stress during collection as at least tag should 

be expected as a natural low percentage reserve of mature O. vulgaris females (Lourenço 

et al., 2014). 

Accordingly to Iglesias et al. (2013) wild zooplankton populations in general, present 

the suitable biochemical composition for the diet of O. vulgaris paralarvae, presenting 

lower levels of total lipids, phos and tag, and higher percentage of PUFAs (DHA and EPA). 

Here, it is important to note that potential prey and hatchlings present identical Protein/ 

Lipid ratios. On the other hand, the differences found in the trophic ratios such as n-

3HUFA/n-6HUFA, DHA/ARA and DHA/EPA found between potential preys and O. 

vulgaris hatchlings are small but significant as they allow differentiating between the two 

groups.  

Notwithstanding being a single pooled sample, this is the first time that the FA 

profile of wild planktonic O. vulgaris paralarvae is determined. Keep in mind the 

preliminary characteristics of these results, the FA profile of these paralarvae shows some 

particular aspects when compared with the hatchlings and the zooplankton groups. 

Compared with the O. vulgaris hatchlings and paralarvae present higher content in C16:0, 

C18:0, C16:1n7 and C18:1n9. This relative enrichment is related with their diet which 

includes herbivorous species such as decapod zoeae and other omnivorous and carnivorous 

holo and meroplankton species (responsible for the denaturation of PUFA and MUFA into 

SFA) (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Bergé &amp;amp; Barnathan, 2005). On the other hand, the ARA 

content of the paralarvae is identical to the observed in the hatchlings and both 

significantly higher than in the potential preys. This fact clarifies the ARA role as an 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

108 

 

essential fatty acid. The high ARA content was already observed in mature females gonads 

(Rosa et al., 2004; Lourenço et al., 2014) and in hatchlings collected off the Gran Canaria 

Island (J. Estefanell, pers comm).  

There are two possible sources for this input of ARA in paralarvae. One of the 

sources can be the PUFA rich tag intake through the meroplankton larvae. Alternatively, it 

may be a product of the desaturation and chain elongation of 18:2n6 and 18:3n3 present in 

the zooplankton (Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Almansa et al., 2006). As found in captive feeding 

experiments (e.g. Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2000, 2003; Almansa et al., 2006) O. vulgaris 

hatchlings and paralarvae are particularly rich in n-6HUFA in relation to their prey 

including ARA, EPA and DHA. The work conducted by Monroig and colleagues (Monroig 

et al. 2012a, 2012b) showed that O. vulgaris are capable of the biosynthesis of several 

essential PUFA particularly C20:3n3, ARA and EPA from HUFA of the families C18 and 

C20. This fact can explain the high content in ARA found in the hatchlings and paralarvae 

in relation to their potential preys. According to Monroig et al., (2012a) the most common 

pathway to the biosynthesis of ARA is through the elongation of n-6HUFA, particularly 

C20:4n6 that we failed to identify both in hatchlings and paralarvae samples. Probably 

other pathway can be active in the paralarvae, biosynthesizing ARA through the n-3HUFA, 

although this option is less clear (Dalsgaard et al., 2006; Monroig et al., 2012a). On the 

other hand, the higher peak of ARA identified in the hatchlings and paralarvae sample can 

be associated with the of C20:3n3, normally a minor FA in marine product, that is also 

synthesized by O. vulgaris (Monroig et al., 2012a) and was not separate from ARA in the 

GC column. 

The comparison of the conditions indices and trophic markers with other studies 

conducted on O. vulgaris paralarvae and their potential preys (see Table 3.7) ashowed a 

consistency between studies in the case of the protein: lipid ratio (Iglesias et al., 2013) and 

for the FA trophic markers SFA: PUFA, DHA: EPA and DHA: ARA (Navarro &amp;amp; 

Villanueva, 2000; Uriarte et al., 2011; Couto, 2012; Iglesias et al., 2013). It is worth noting 

the variability observed in the tag content obtained here as compared to results obtained in 

the previously cited studies. Both for the potential preys and for the O. vulgaris hatchlings, 

our results show a significantly lower content in tag by comparison with the feeding 

experiments conducted by Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva (2000), Couto (2012) and Iglesias et al. 

(2013).

109 

 

The high natural availability of HUFA n-3 (HUFA n-3: HUFA n-6 ~ 12) supports the 

results obtained by Seixas et al. (2010) as they failed to observe any enhanced survival or 

growth when paralarvae were fed with Artemia enriched with DHA. DHA and other HUFA 

n-3 are naturally abundant in the prey of O. vulgaris paralarvae as well as in the summer 

phytoplankton community, so it is unlikely that these FA are limiting nutrient for the 

development of the species.  In this case, the protein: lipid ratio of the diet was found to be 

more important to promote a good growth and survival of the paralarvae. A significant 

positive linear correlation was found between an increasing Protein: Lipid ratio in the diet 

and the dry weight of paralarvae, at 15 and 25 days of rearing, whereas no correlation 

could be established between dietary DHA content and growth or survival of paralarvae 

(Seixas, 2009).   

We believe that the biochemical profile and trophic ratios determined here both for 

the potential preys and for the O. vulgaris hatchlings allow an understanding of the 

nutritional requirements of the paralarval stage. Several studies showed that the lipid 

content of preys has a clear influence on the lipid composition of octopus paralarvae both 

at the level of lipid class and FA composition (Navarro &amp;amp; Villanueva, 2000, 2003; Iglesias 

et al., 2013). On the other hand, the nutritional profile of newly hatched paralarvae from 

the wild permits the identification of the specific nutritional requirements under culture 

conditions, in order to attain a good nutritional condition independently of external factors 

(Uriarte et al., 2011). 

Studies such as this one are difficult to perform due to constrains related with the low 

number of wild O. vulgaris paralarvae that can normally be captured and to the high water 

content of their tissues. Nevertheless, the colorimetric methods applied herein facilitate the 

study of these small-sized O. vulgaris paralarvae. Further biochemical and physiological 

studies on wild paralarvae after first feeding are however still needed to untangle the 

nutritional deficiencies verified under culture conditions for O. vulgaris paralarvae.

ABSTRACT 

The exploitation of the common octopus Octopus vulgaris in Portugal increased 50% in the last 20 

years, largely motivated by the depletion of many fish stocks. Recently, the biomass of this fishery 

resource sharply decreased in some areas causing a major concern among local fishermen and an 

effort is underway to advice on novel and sustainable management measures. In this context, the 

octopus pre-recruit aggregations along the Portuguese coast are identified using georeferenced 

fishery-independent data, from autumn and winter sampling between 1996 and 2008. The 

relationships between pre-recruit aggregations and several environmental variables are analysed to 

characterize their essential habitats (EFH). Pre-recruits are distributed throughout the Portuguese 

coast aggregated in 8 distinct recruitment grounds located on the middle-shelf at 11-19 km from the 

coastline, which are characterised by average bottom depths of 65-110 m and to be associated to 

major rivers and lagoon systems. Within each season pre-recruit abundance is much higher in the 

south region, while pre-recruit aggregations on the northwest coast showed high inter-annual and 

seasonal variation driven by environmental variability. The western zone adjacent to Ria Formosa 

lagoon (southern coast) was identified as the main recruitment ground for O. vulgaris along the 

Portuguese coast. This is supported either by the higher abundance of pre-recruits and by the 

recurrence of their presence in this area over the years analysed, both in autumn and winter. The 

effects of physical variables on pre-recruit abundance modelled with generalized additive models 

(GAM) showed important regional differences. Bottom salinity and river runoff are the 

environmental variables that have more impact on pre-recruit distribution and abundance on the 

west coast, regardless of any seasonal effects. On the other hand, temperature imposes distinct 

seasonal and regional limitations to pre-recruit distribution, both on the NW and S regions. Pre-

recruit preferential habitat is characterised by bottom temperatures of 14 ºC, salinity values around 

36.0, low precipitation (average&amp;lt;200 mm), and coarse sediments (in which they find shelters to 

escape predation). Some of the octopus recruitment grounds identified are located in areas under 

intense fishing pressure, both by artisanal fisheries using traps and by bottom trawling. Thus, their 

value for the sustainability of the octopus fishery should be taken into consideration in future 

marine management strategies.

3.3.1. Introduction 

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797, is one of the most 

commercially important cephalopods worldwide. It is exploited as a target species by 

demersal trawl fleets and several local fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel 

nets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al., 2009). In Portugal 

it is also one of the most important fisheries resources, often the most important species in 

first sale value, with average landings of 8500 tonnes per year (1986 - 2011). It is captured 

mainly with traps (~90%), thus having a major importance in the Portuguese artisanal 

fishery, namely on the south region (Algarve), where it accounts for more than 20% of the 

fishing activity income (DGRM, 2012). The exploitation of octopus in Portugal increased 

50% in the last 20 years, largely motivated by the depletion of many finfish stocks. 

Recently, the landed biomass of this fishery resource has sharply decreased in some areas 

causing a major concern among local fishermen and an effort is underway by scientists to 

advice on novel and sustainable management measures.  

O. vulgaris has a short life cycle of 12-18 months (Iglesias et al., 2004; Katsanevakis 

&amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). The spawning season extends, in general, throughout the year 

(Hastie et al., 2009). Over the NW Portuguese shelf spawning occurs in two main peaks 

(April and August) and at the south shelf a single peak is generally detected in summer 

(Lourenço et al., 2012). Paralarvae are planktonic and settle in the benthic habitat of adults 

at ca 173 mg of total weight (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). After settlement animals 

grow fast at ca. 1.2-1.6% d
-1 

reaching the fisheries minimum landing weight (750 g) at 9-

10 months old (Domain et al., 2000; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). O. vulgaris is 

mainly a coastal species (0-100 m depth) with a wide geographic distribution. Density is 

low between 100 and 200 m and only few specimens have been found beyond the 

continental shelf break (Belcari &amp;amp; Sartor, 1999; Quetglas et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002; 

Garofalo et al., 2010). Juveniles and spawners have generally a distinct depth range 

distribution (Sanchez &amp;amp; Obarti, 1993; Hernandez-Garcia et al., 1997; Faraj &amp;amp; Bez, 2007). 

Of the environmental variables that may affect the spatial distribution and abundance of 

juveniles, seawater temperature is thought to be the most important one (Garofalo et al., 

2010).  

Habitat modelling for marine animals is increasingly used as a management tool, to 

support conservation and sustainable exploitation. “Essential Fish Habitat” (EFH) is the 

habitat identified as essential to the ecological and biological requirements for critical life

history stages of exploited species, and which may require special protection to improve 

stock status and long term sustainability (e.g. Ardizzone, 2006; Valavanis &amp;amp; Smith, 2007). 

EFH may be modelled based on the abundance of animals at specific life cycle stages (e.g. 

juveniles) and the habitat identified as the aggregation of abiotic and biotic parameters 

where individuals of that specific life cycle stage are concentrated (e.g. recruitment 

grounds). Successful modelling depends on knowledge of species biology and ecology, 

thus permitting selection of appropriate variables, measured at an appropriate scale (see 

Valavanis et al., 2008).  

The O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics increase this species resilience to high 

fishing pressure. At the same time O. vulgaris populations are vulnerable to overfishing 

because of non?overlapping generations (Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 2005), and the juvenile phase 

(the pre-recruits) is therefore a key life stage on which we may concentrate fishery 

management to ensure sustainability of this heavily exploited species. The present study 

aims to, firstly identify along the Portuguese coast areas where pre-recruits of O. vulgaris 

aggregate, using georeferenced fishery-independent data, that may be protected in future 

management options; and secondly, to analyse the relationships between pre-recruit 

abundance and several abiotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum habitat.  

 

3.3.2. Material and Methods 

3.3.2.1. Survey sampling 

Two sets of bottom trawl surveys carried out on the Portuguese continental coast 

onboard R/V Noruega and R/V Capricórnio were selected for the analysis of Octopus 

vulgaris pre-recruit aggregations, the autumn and winter surveys. The main objective of 

these research surveys is to estimate indices of abundance and biomass of the most 

commercially important fish and crustacean species. For our study we selected only the 

surveys which used a bottom trawling net suitable to sample benthic species, the 

“FGAV019”, with a cod end of 20 mm mesh size, a mean vertical opening of 2.5 m and a 

mean horizontal opening between wings of 25 m. The sampling area covered latitudes 

36.7º to 41.8º N and longitudes 7.47º to 10.0º W in the NE Atlantic. Both datasets were 

obtained following a similar depth stratified sampling design, with ca. 70-80 hauls 

distributed along the Portuguese continental shelf and slope (Figure 3.8). The tow duration 

varied between 20 and 60 min, but no significant differences were previously found in the

mean abundance and length distribution for several species due to different tow duration 

(Cardador, pers comm). The number of hauls by research cruise and other characteristics of 

the sampling procedure are detailed in Table 3.8. In each sampling station, all of the O. 

vulgaris captured were weighted (individual body weight, to the nearest g) and measured 

(mantle length, to the nearest 0.5 mm).

3.3.2.2. Environmental data 
 

The following environmental variables were selected and assigned to each sampling 

station. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data (SST) were obtained for each 

sampling station from the AVHRR Pathfinder V.5 provided by NASA-JPL-Physical 

Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). Sea bottom temperature 

(SBT), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea bottom salinity (SBS) were extracted from CTD 

temperature profiles undertaken during the survey cruises at the end of the fishing stations.

CTD data were not available for a few stations and for the winter2005 cruise. SBT data to 

fill in these gaps were obtained from CTD casts extracted from NODC and ICES 

databases. Bottom sediment type (BS) in each sampling station was classified based on the 

fishery charts from the Instituto Hidrográfico as gravel (gv), coarse sand (cs), sand (s), 

mud (md) and rocky mud (rm). River runoff (RR) from the main rivers and rainfall (RA) 

were extracted from the Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos 

(http://snirh.pt).

3.3.2.3. Data analysis 

Octopus with body weight below the fisheries minimum landing weight (750 g) 

captured on the survey cruises listed in Table 3.8, were classified as pre-recruits and their 

distribution and abundance used to identify O. vulgaris recruitment grounds. Catches were 

converted into an abundance index as number of pre-recruits per hour trawling. 

The spatial distribution of pre-recruits was analysed and mapped with the 

geostatistics interpolation method, Krigging (Cressie, 1991), implemented in the software 

SURFER 9.0. Pre-recruit abundance (PR) data were interpolated separately by Krigging, 

using a linear variogram with no nugget effect, for each cruise and also averaged for 

autumn and winter cruises. Distinct recruitment grounds were spatially identified as those 

areas centered at pre-recruit distribution centroids with a mean PR ? 5 ind.h

 (in at least

one season). Additionally, to assess the relevance of each recruitment ground for the 

common octopus pre-recruits, an index of exclusiveness, EI was calculated as the ratio 

between PR and the total species abundance. To verify whether the recruitment grounds 

were located in the same area consistently through time, an index of persistence, PI 

(adapted from Garofalo et al., 2010) was also estimated as the proportion of cruises within 

each season a given recruitment ground was actually used. 

To analyze the spatial distribution, the sampled area was divided into 3 regions, 

which are environmentally different and 13 areas. To analyze distribution with depth 

(DepthZ), the sampling stations were also assigned to the inner-shelf (is,&amp;lt;40 m), middle-

shelf (ms, 40-90 m), outer-shelf (os, 90-200 m), and slope (s, &gt; 200 m). The distance of 

each sampling station to the coast line (Dcoast) was also estimated. Total pressure (PRS) in 

each sampling station was estimated from bottom depth. A measure of RR by cruise and 

area was calculated as the total runoff in each of the 13 areas. A measure of RA by cruise 

and area was calculated as the total rainfall for the period of each survey cruise recorded in 

the main coastal city in each of the 13 areas. These values were replicated and assigned to 

each sampling station within each area. Mean pre-recruit abundance was calculated in 

relation to categorized temporal, spatial and physical variables. The effects of these 

explanatory variables in pre-recruit abundances were investigated using one-way ANOVA, 

after checking for normality in the sample distributions (Shapiro test), and for homogeneity 

of variances (Bartlett test). The interactions between Region and the other variables and the 

interactions between Season and the other variables, were also tested by two-way ANOVA. 

The relationships between log transformed pre-recruit abundance (logPR) and the 

continuous physical explanatory variables: Dcoast, PRES, SST, SBT, SSS, SBS, RA, and 

log transformed RR (logRR) were further investigated using Generalised Additive Models 

(GAMs), thereby allowing non-linearity in the relationships to be taken into account. Since 

logPR was normally distributed we used a Gaussian GAM with identity link. The nominal 

variables Year and BS were also included in models. For all continuous explanatory 

variables, degrees of freedom were constrained to be less than 5 to avoid overfitting. 

Models were fitted using a backwards selection starting with full models and removing 

explanatory variables with non-significant partial effects. The Akaike Information 

Criterion (AIC) was used to choose the best fitting model (lowest AIC). More information 

about these techniques can be found in Zuur et al. (2007). Preferred habitat (highest mean

PR) and habitat limits (PR&lt;1 ind.h

) for O. vulgaris pre-recruits within the sampled area 

were estimated as proxies of EFH for this key life stage. 

 

3.3.3. Results 

3.3.3.1. Environmental variation along the Portuguese continental shelf 
 

Over the Portuguese continental shelf SST is much higher in autumn than in winter 

and was ca. 2-4 ºC lower in the NW region than in the S region. Within the period analysed 

autumn SST ranged between 14.0 ºC and 21.7 ºC and winter SST ranged between 11.6 ºC 

and 16.6 ºC (Figure 3.9 a). There was little seasonal variation in the mean SBT (13.9±0.9 

ºC), but SBT was on average ~1.5ºC lower in the NW region than in the S region. Autumn 

SBT ranged between 11.4 ºC and 17.3 ºC, and winter SBT ranged between 11.7 ºC and 

15.8 ºC (Figure 3.9 b). In autumn the water column was still stratified and important 

differences existed between SST and SBT, namely in the SW and S regions (~5 ºC). On the 

contrary SST was only slightly higher than SBT during the winter period of water column 

mixing, namely on the NW region (~0.5 ºC). 

The expected positive correlation between temperature and salinity may be observed 

by the spatial variation of salinity similar to that of temperature, decreasing with increasing 

latitude and also away from the influence of the Mediterranean salty waters. Despite this 

fact, both mean SSS and mean SBS along the Portuguese shelf were lower in autumn 

(when temperature was higher) than in winter (Figure 3.9 c, d). Rainfall levels during 

autumn and winter were similar between areas 1 and 10, but towards the north rainfall 

increased substantially, especially during autumn (Figure 3.10 a). The higher river runoff 

levels occurred in autumn located at areas 7, 10, 12 and 13 (Figure 3.10 b), associated 

mainly to the rivers Tagus, Mondego, Douro and Lima, respectively. The low saline waters 

from these river discharges generally spread along the west coast with a poleward 

direction, therefore with no influence in the areas south of area 7. The seasonal differences 

in salinity derive most likely from the higher levels of autumn rainfall and consequent river 

discharges, which contributed to a decrease in salinity of coastal waters more significant in 

autumn than in winter.

O. vulgaris pre-recruits were quite frequent (55-83% of total octopus catches) both 

during the autumn and winter research surveys and were represented by specimens with a 

mean body weight of 300 - 450 g (Table 3.8). They were widely distributed along the 

Portuguese coast, but an important seasonality in their distribution and abundance was 

apparent, in winter, octopus pre-recruits were more abundant, spread and shifted towards 

the south (Figure 3.11). In winter abundance was twice as high (mean PR ? 6ind.h
-1

) as in 

autumn (mean PR ? 3ind.h
-1

), in particular during the winter2005 and winter2008 surveys. 

However, on the NW region, pre-recruit abundance was higher in autumn, namely in the 

autumn1996 survey. Within each season abundance was much higher on the S region, 

especially at area 2, where the concentration of pre-recruits was recurrent each year.

standard error. 

Pre-recruits were found aggregated in eight distinct grounds, A to H. On the NW 

region 3 recruitment grounds were identified during autumn (Figure 3.12 a), located close 

to the mouth of river Lima (A, only present in autumn1996 survey); close to river Douro 

and the lagoon system of Ria de Aveiro (B); and south of river Mondego (C). During 

winter (Figure 3.12 b), the recruitment ground B shifted to the southern part of Ria de 

Aveiro, partially merging with C. On the SW region, 3 recruitment grounds were also 

identified: D located at ? 140 m in autumn in the vicinity of the Nazaré canyon and shifted 

southwards closer to the mouth of river Tagus in winter; E at area 6, close to the estuary of 

the river Sado with higher PR in winter; and the recruitment ground F at areas 4 and 5 

extending from the coastline to offshore of the 130 m isobath in winter. On the S region the 

highest concentration of pre-recruits was located west of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa 

(H) in autumn (mean above 30 ind.h
-1

). The whole S region could be considered a single 

recruitment ground in winter. Despite this, based on spatial differences in abundance 

within this region, two distinct areas of concentration of pre-recruits may be identified: the 

recruitment ground G centred at area 3; and H with the highest concentration of pre-

recruits (winter mean above 80 ind.h
-1

), centred at area 2 west of the lagoon system of Ria 

Formosa, as was in autumn, but spreading eastwards into area 1.

The location of each recruitment ground is summarized in Table 3.9. Overall, the 

most persistent recruitment grounds, with PI=1, were the recruitment grounds F and G in 

winter and H both in autumn and winter. Additionally, these grounds were important 

habitats in particular for pre-recruits showing high levels of exclusiveness (EI). The 

recruitment grounds on the NW region showed high EI but low PI giving evidence of 

higher inter-annual variation in pre-recruit distribution within this region.

3.3.3.3. Environmental effects and essential habitat   
 

ANOVA results indicated that the individual effects of all temporal, spatial and 

physical variables analysed on pre-recruit abundance were significant. The effects of the 

explanatory variables Year, DepthZ, Dcoast, BS, SST and SBT were significantly 

dependent of Region, but independent from any seasonal effects (except for SST) (Table 

3.10). The effects of the physical variables related to water salinity: SSS, SBS, RA, and 

RR, were independent both of Region and Season.  

To further investigate the relationships between physical variables and pre-recruit 

abundance, GAMs were fitted separately for the NW, SW and S regions given the above 

mentioned “explanatory variable”: Region interactions. The optimum models are listed in 

Table 3.11. The best-fit GAM for pre-recruit abundance on the NW region explains about 

47% of deviance and has the form: logPR ~ 1 + factor(Year) + factor(Season) + factor(BS)

+ s(Dcoast) + s(SST) + s(SBS) + s(logRR). The best-fit GAM for the SW region explains 

ca. 44% of deviance and has the form: logPR ~ 1 + factor(Year) + s(Dcoast) + s(SBS) + 

s(logRR). Finally, the best-fit GAM for the S region explains ca. 69% of deviance and has 

the form: logPR ~ 1 + factor(BS) + s(PRS) + s(SST).

Preferred habitat and habitat limits of O. vulgaris pre-recruits are summarized in 

Table 3.12. The variation in pre-recruit abundance with the categorical variables Year, 

Season, DepthZ, Dcoast, and BS in each region is depicted in Figure 3.13. Pre-recruit 

abundance presented an important inter-annual variation within each region (Figure 3.13 

a), particularly high in autumn 1996 on the NW region and in autumn 2004 on the S 

region. During winter, the abundance was very high in 2005, 2006 and 2008 on the S 

region and in 2007 on the SW region. On the west regions the Year effect explained some 

variability not accounted by the other explanatory variables considered (Table 3.11). On 

the other hand, the Year effect was not retained in the optimum GAM for the S region.

Pre-recruit’ habitat includes a variety of bottom sediments, but they seemed to 

concentrate preferably over large grain sediments in relation to fine sand or mud (Figure 

3.13 b). Their abundance was the highest over gravel on the NW region and coarse sand on 

the S region (gravel not sampled). The effect of BS on the SW region was not significant 

(Table 3.11), but the overlay of the recruitment grounds on a bottom sediments type map 

(online figure) showed that those on the SW region were located over several BS, all 

neighbouring rock outcrops. 

Pre-recruits were concentrated mainly in the middle-shelf at a mean depth of 79 m 

(±44 SD) on the NW region, 108 m (±45 SD) on the SW region, and 66 m (±31 SD) on the 

S region, with insignificant seasonal variation in the preferred depth zone (Figure 3.13 c). 

The highest abundances were located at 19 km (±9 SD) from the coastline on the NW 

region, 11 km (±6 SD) on the SW region, and 13 km (±3 SD) on the S region (Figure 3.13 

d). The distribution limit was slightly deeper in winter (360 m) than in autumn (332 m), but 

abundances on the slope deeper than 350 m (PRS &gt; 35.7 atm) were consistently rather low 

(Table 3.9, PR &amp;lt;1 ind.h
-1

). On the SW region, because the continental shelf is narrow and 

steep, pre-recruits aggregated on the middle-shelf deeper than in the other regions (see also 

Table 3.9). Nevertheless, distribution on the west coast was mainly affected by the distance 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

128 

 

to the coast line (Dcoast) rather than by total pressure (PRS). Abundance decreased linearly 

with increasing distance to the coast line; gradually on the wider continental shelf of the 

NW region (Figure 3.14 a), and more obviously on the narrow and steeper continental shelf 

of the SW region (Figure 3.14 e). On the other hand, pre-recruit distribution on the S 

region was mainly affected by PRS, with abundance abruptly decreasing until depths of 25 

atm and with no further effect in deeper waters (Figure 3.14 h).

Over the continental shelf pre-recruits were found associated preferably with SST of 

15.3 ºC (±1.3 SD) on the NW region and with SST of 16.0 ºC (±1.6 SD) on the SW (Table 

3.12). On the NW region, the effect of SST was non-linear showing some seasonal 

dependence: abundance increases with increasing local winter SST and with increasing 

local autumn SST, i.e. main recruitment grounds are located under the warmest 

temperatures available and the general SST effect seems a more complex nonlinear 

relationship (Figure 3.14 b). On the other hand, abundance decreases with increasing SST 

on the S region (Figure 3.14 i). In this region, over the continental shelf, pre-recruits were 

found associated preferably with SST of 16.0 ºC (±1.8 SD). The effect of SBT showed 

some regional dependence, but regional SBT differences were of small magnitude and the 

effect of this explanatory variable on GAMs for each region was negligible (Table 3.11). 

Pre-recruits were found associated preferentially with SBT of 14.0 ºC (±0.7 SD) on the 

NW region, 14.1 ºC (±0.7 SD) on the SW region and 14.6 º C (±0.9 SD) on the S region. In 

general, pre-recruit habitat seems to be limited to temperatures above 12.0 ºC, SST&gt;13ºC 

and SBT&gt;12ºC (Table 3.12).

and S (white bar) regions by (a) in each research cruise (Year), (b) bottom sediment (BS), (c) depth zone 

(DepthZ), and (d) distance to coast line (Dcoast). 

 

Pre-recruit abundance was consistently higher in the more saline waters, with salinity 

? 36.0, independently of any regional or seasonal effects. The effect of SSS was not 

relevant to explain pre-recruit distribution, but on the NW region abundance increased with 

SBS between 35.5 and 36.2 where most data were obtained. Moreover, the exceptional 

occurrence of recruitment ground A was probably related to the unusual high salinities in 

area 13 verified in autumn1996 survey. Episodic lower salinities also introduced some 

complexity to the SBS effect on this region (Figure 3.14c). SBS explained also the location 

of recruitment grounds on the SW region: pre-recruit abundance increased with increasing 

SBS until a maximum of ca. 36.1, decreasing towards the saltiest waters (Figure 3.14 f). In 

general, pre-recruit habitat was limited by SBS below 35.60 and above 36.30 (Table 3.12).

Higher concentrations of pre-recruits were also related to areas with relatively low 

rainfall (preferred RA = 166±82 mm), such as on the S region (Table 3.12). However, 

rainfall was not relevant to explain pre-recruit distribution within each region (Table 3.11). 

Similarly, the highest concentrations of pre-recruits were found on the S region, where 

there is considerably less river runoff than on the west coast (Figure 3.10 b). Both on the 

NW and SW regions, distribution and abundance were significantly affected by RR. 

Despite the main recruitment grounds were located close to the main rivers and lagoon 

systems, i.e. associated to areas with important river runoff, abundance decreased under the 

highest runoff levels of the NW region (Figure 3.14 d). This negative effect was not 

observed on the SW region, (Figure 3.14 g), despite the important RR levels which 

occurred in area 7 (Figure 3.10 b). 

 

3.3.4. Discussion 

O. vulgaris pre-recruits were widely distributed along the Portuguese coast. The 

abundance was substantially higher in the south coastal waters than on the west coast as 

expected, considering that the general distribution of this species in the Eastern Atlantic 

have the highest densities towards the south, namely on the north-western coasts of Africa 

(Balguerias et al., 2000). Pre-recruit distribution in Portuguese waters was patchy and 

animals aggregated in several recruitment grounds. The area surrounding the lagoon 

system “Ria de Aveiro” seems to be the most important recruitment ground for O. vulgaris 

in the NW region, and on the SW region pre-recruits aggregated in recruitment grounds 

close to Tagus and Sado estuaries. Moreover, on the S region, despite the whole continental 

shelf showed a high abundance of small octopus, they were aggregated more abundantly 

close to the lagoon system “Ria Formosa”. Consequently, some of the most important 

recruitment grounds of O. vulgaris are located in the vicinity of estuarine or lagoon 

systems. These are highly productive ecosystems with high abundance and diversity of 

marine fish and invertebrate species, providing excellent feeding conditions to the young 

stages of many species (Cabral et al., 2007). Species such as O. vulgaris, which are 

stenohaline in all life stages, are not estuarine inhabitants, but may take advantage of these 

productive ecosystems by living in their vicinity.

Likewise in Portuguese waters, in other areas of O. vulgaris distribution, juveniles and sub-

adults generally aggregate in coastal waters at a relatively short distance from the coastline. 

It is the case of several Mediterranean areas, where the highest abundances of O. vulgaris 

captured by bottom trawl surveys (mostly pre-recruits) were found within the depth range 

of 10-50 m by Belcari et al. (2002). Similarly, sub-adult densities are higher in shallow 

waters (20-40 m) than further offshore in the NW African coasts (Faraj &amp;amp; Bez, 2007). Even 

so, these authors located the preferred distribution of small octopus inshore of the main 

recruitment grounds identified along the Portuguese coast. In contrast, a different 

demographic distribution was described by Belcari et al. (2002), Quetglas et al. (1998) and 

Sanchez &amp;amp; Obarti (1993) for the Western Mediterranean and by Hernandez-Garcia et al. 

(1997) for the Canary Islands, as they all observed a wider bathymetric distribution of the 

small animals.  In Portuguese waters we also found a wide distribution of O. vulgaris pre-

recruits, with aggregations centred at mean depths of ~80 m, and approximately at 10-15 

km from the coast. However, the surveyed area of the cruises analysed poorly covers the 

inner-shelf, namely on the S region (see Figure 3.8), the region where the abundance was 

the highest, which may have contributed to an overestimation of the pre-recruit preferred 

depth or distance to the coast line. Overcoming this sampling constrain, both the spatial 

distribution predicted by geostatistics interpolation of abundance and the GAM modelling 

of the Depth or Dcoast effects on PR for each region indicated that PR increases towards 

shallow waters, and for that reason the main recruitment grounds should be in general 

located in even more coastal areas. 

O. vulgaris adults are equally abundant over a variety of sediment types (Mangold, 

1983). Nevertheless, we observed that sub-adults have a preference for large grain 

sediments, namely gravel and coarse sand. Despite the lack of sampling over the rocky 

ocean floor, we found also the pre-recruit distribution to be closely related to the proximity 

of rocky bottoms and abundance over mud with rock outcrops significantly higher than 

over soft mud. This positive relationship between small size octopus density and sediment 

grain size was also documented by Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos (2004a) in Greek waters. 

This sediment type preference is, to some extent, related to their necessity of sheltering to 

avoid predation, and octopuses do it either selecting or building shelters (“dens”) in the 

substratum (Mather, 1988).  

The relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several abiotic environmental 

variables were analyzed to delineate pre-recruit optimum habitat and eventual 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile

environmental limitations to their distribution. Using presence-absence data, Hermosilla et 

al. (2011) modelled the distribution and large scale habitat preferences of O. vulgaris in the 

Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and concluded that the area used by octopus differs 

from the average available environmental conditions in terms of bottom temperature and 

bottom salinity.  

In Portuguese waters salinity proved to be an important determinant for the 

aggregation of O. vulgaris pre-recruits. Their distribution was limited by SBS below 35.60 

and above 36.30 and the preferred habitat was characterized by salinities of ? 36.0. The 

higher abundance was hence observed on the S region, where both rainfall and river runoff 

are generally low and mean seasonal SBS has a narrow range (36.01-36.21, Figure 3.9 d). 

Within its global distribution this species prefers habitats with bottom salinity between 30 

and 45 (Hermosilla et al., 2011), and is fairly abundant under salinities at least up to 39 

(e.g. in the Greek Seas, Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2004a). Thus, the reason why we 

observed a negative effect of salinities above 36.03 in Portuguese waters may be partially 

related to the low availability of more saline waters in the study area, or that negative effect 

relates to regional environmental tolerances. At the same time, low salinity is a limitation 

for octopus survival (Chapela et al., 2006; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004) and hence constrains its 

distribution. The negative effect of SBS was mainly observed on the west coast. Here, 

salinities generally fall below 36.0 in autumn and winter, namely on the northern area 

caused by heavy rainfall and subsequent important river discharges. Despite this, as 

mentioned before, several recruitment grounds were identified close to large rivers and 

lagoon systems (although this does not equate to low salinity water). The proximity to 

estuarine systems provides an increased availability of prey, namely bivalves, but greatly 

enhances the risk of low salinity episodes. In fact, mass mortality episodes of O. vulgaris 

have sometimes been reported on the Portuguese coast and have been related to sudden 

falls in water salinity due to intense river discharges, following heavy rainfall periods 

(Ruano, 2011).  

The effect of temperature on pre-recruits distribution was also important, even if less 

significant than salinity. It was observed that SST affects the distribution and abundance of 

octopus paralarvae in their zooplanktonic habitat (González et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 

2009). However, it is expected that the subsequent life stages, living strongly associated 

with the ocean floor, suffer a more intense (or direct) influence of the temperature near the 

bottom. In that sense, pre-recruits were found associated preferably with SBT between 15 



3. Habitat requirements for Octopus vulgaris paralarvae and juvenile 

 

135 

 

and 16 ºC and the main recruitment grounds were limited to mean SBT &gt; 13.6 ºC. 

Similarly, to the general distribution of the species in relation to the available environment 

described by Hermosilla and co-workers (2011), we found that the pre-recruits of O. 

vulgaris concentrate also under the warmest temperatures, i.e. prefer areas where SBT have 

an average greater than those of the environment. On the other hand, if compared with the 

habitat modelling in Hermosilla et al. (2011), cold water (SBT &amp;lt;12 ºC) seems to impose a 

more pronounced limitation to pre-recruit distribution than to adult distribution. During the 

surveys analysed, SBT was quite stable within each region and no significant effect of this 

variable on PR was retained by GAMs. Even so, on the NW region we observed important 

seasonal and inter-annual variation in distribution and abundance of pre-recruits which 

may stand for seasonal and yearly differences in SBT (e.g. unusual low SBT in autumn 

2004). Even if temperature at surface supposedly affects less the life stages living on the 

bottom, we found a significant effect of SST on pre-recruit distribution (positive on the 

west regions and negative on the S region). Pre-recruit preferred habitat was characterized 

by SSTs of 15.3-16.0 ºC and limited by SST&lt;13 ºC. Furthermore, SSTs above 21 ºC seem 

to have constrained the eastwards spread of the recruitment ground H on the S region in 

2003. In this region the Year effect was not kept in the optimum GAM for the S region and 

consequently the inter-annual variation in pre-recruit abundance in this region must be 

explained essentially by SST (the only variable in the model passive of yearly changes). 

Other studies which modelled O. vulgaris abundance in relation to environmental 

variables found that oceanographic conditions play a very significant role in determining 

the distribution and abundance during the paralarval phase (e.g. Moreno et al., 2009; Otero 

et al., 2009). Inter-relationships between paralarval distribution, settlement and recruitment 

ground locations are still largely unknown. This is a field in which much work is still 

required and that we expect will be evolving in the near future.  

Based on pre-recruit abundance, PI and EI together we may consider the winter 

recruitment grounds D and F on the SW region, and G and H on the S region, as the main 

pre-recruit hot spots on the Portuguese continental shelf, where these animals meet their 

optimum habitat. Ria Formosa recruitment ground (H) is probably the most important O. 

vulgaris pre-recruit hot spot along the Portuguese coast showing the highest abundances 

both in autumn and in winter. Important recruitment grounds were also observed on the 

NW region close to Ria the Aveiro (B) and south the mouth of the river Mondego (C), but

136 

 

pre-recruit abundance showed larger inter-annual variation, probably associated to the 

environmental dynamics of the local upwelling ecosystem. 

Overall, the distribution pattern of pre-recruits predicted by the spatial interpolation 

might have missed the identification of some important aggregation areas. Indeed, the 

model predicted low concentration of small octopuses in the eastern part of the south coast. 

Notwithstanding, according to fishermen surveys, in this part of the coast aggregations 

occur in very shallow waters (6–12m depth) between October and December, with higher 

concentrations in front of the inlets of the Ria Formosa lagoon and near the estuary of the 

river Guadiana. In these areas, there is high abundance of prey, mainly bivalves (Rufino et 

al., 2010), and the substrate is coarse (Rosa et al., in press) with a high fraction of bioclasts 

constituted by large molluscan shells fragments where small octopuses can hide. 

Altogether, food availability and habitat characteristics might explain the high 

concentration of pre-recruits in this part of the coast. Similarly, fishermen also reported 

that small-sized octopuses are numerous during winter in the westernmost part of the south 

coast (between Lagos and Sagres), especially near the rocky outcrops in inshore waters, 

where they find refuge from predators.  

The recruitment grounds in the proximity of Ria de Aveiro and close to Ria Formosa 

are areas subject to intense fishing activity: the artisanal fishery (traps and pots) exploits 

the inshore part and the bottom trawl fishery exploits the offshore part of those recruitment 

grounds (Pilar-Fonseca et al., 2014). In principle, Portuguese fishery regulations determine 

that small animals (&lt;750g) are to be returned to the water if caught, which if respected 

would suffice to maintain the safety of octopus recruitment grounds, regardless of the type 

of activity in the area. Nevertheless, the identification of a spatially restricted critical area 

could be useful to the legislation reinforcement.  

This study was an essential first step towards the understanding of O. vulgaris pre-

recruits essential habitat. Nevertheless, we recognize that further information should be 

obtained in future studies to complement and refine our research. First of all, abundance 

based on trawl data should be complemented with data from other sources because the 

efficiency of a fishing trawl depends on the type of dens that the octopuses use in the 

surveyed area, which varies in relation to depth, octopus size, and sediment type 

(Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopolus, 2004b). Additionally, it would be desirable to include other 

sources of abundance data to have a better coverage of octopus distribution over the inner-

shelf, and in areas with extensive deployment of artisanal fishing gears, where survey

sampling is often compromised. More input derived from “Fishers ecological knowledge” 

(FEK) would be desirable in future studies.

ABSTRACT 

The estimation of age and growth of cephalopod stocks is a key issue for their sustainable 

management. Recently, several studies have successfully validated the daily deposition of growth 

rings in the vestigial shell or stylets of several octopus species. Octopus vulgaris eggs were 

incubated to hatching at two different temperatures, 18
o
C and 22

o
C, to determine stylet size at 

hatching and assess the effect of temperature in the stylet dimensions. The 3 days-old hatchlings 

were sectioned transversally and 6 µm sections were stained to enhance the stylet position and 

visibility. The sections were observed under transmitted light microscopy at 1000x magnification, 

and the stylets identified as blue/green structures inside of the mantle – funnel retractor muscle. 

The transversal sections of the whole paralarva allowed the diameter of the embryonic stylet of an 

octopus species to be measured for the first time. The mean stylet diameter in three-day old 

paralarvae is 3.99 ?m independently of the thermal conditions. Moreover, significant differences in 

stylet size between captive and wild paralarvae were observed; the latter showed significantly 

larger stylets, an indication that they are over three-days old. Our results also evidence that the 

stylet nucleus of hatchlings is much smaller than previously thought based on measurements in 

stylets of juveniles and adults, and its' dimensions are independent of paralarva and stylet size.

4.1.1. Introduction 

The assessment of growth and age provides important input data for many stock 

assessment models and thus is very important for the sustainable management of fisheries 

stocks. In cephalopods, considering that the success of recruitment depends almost entirely 

on environmental conditions, it is quite important to understand how reproduction, life 

span and in particular growth, are affected by those conditions. 

Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797 is an important resource for the artisanal and industrial 

fisheries in all of the Atlantic margin of the Iberian peninsula, with annual average landings 

of 9185 tons in Portugal (INE, 2013) and 4000 in Galicia (Otero et al., 2005). Females of 

this species brood thousands of small eggs usually in rocky crevices (Rocha et al., 2001). 

After hatching, the jet-propelled hatchlings (paralarvae) stay in the pelagic realm, where 

they are highly vulnerable to predation by the macro zooplankton (mainly decapods) and 

mid water fish (Roura, 2013; Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). During the first days, 

paralarvae still carry the yolk sac within the visceral mass and combine endogeneous 

(yolk) with exogenous (prey) feeding until the yolk is completely consumed (Villanueva &amp;amp; 

Norman, 2008). Thereafter, the paralarvae grow exponentially until settlement, followed by 

a logarithmic phase where the instantaneous growth rate decreases until the maturation 

phase is complete (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). The life span of O. vulgaris was 

estimated in one to two years (Domain, Jouffre, &amp;amp; Caveriviére, 2000; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; 

Verriopoulos, 2006). Direct ageing methods based on statolith increment analysis were not 

found to be useful in incirrate octopods, while approaches using beaks in Octopus vulgaris 

still need accuracy validation, in particular due to erosion by feeding (Raya &amp;amp; Hernández-

González, 1998; Perales-Raya et al., 2010; Canali et al., 2011). A further alternative to 

perform direct age assessments is the use of the vestigial shell or stylet (Sousa Reis &amp;amp; 

Fernandes, 2002). Stylets are slender, needle–shaped and bent rods, a non-calcified ?-chitin 

structure lying obliquely on the dorso-lateral side of the mantle, that arose from the 

reduction of the shell in the Incirrata (Budelmann et al., 1997; Naef, 1921, 1923 in 

Bizikov, 2004). Its function is unclear in finless octopus but its position in the insertion of 

the funnel retractors, visceral sac and gillnets in the mantle is an indication of a structural 

function (Budelmann et al., 1997; Bizikov, 2004). Growth of stylets progresses from the 

centre (stylet primordium) located in the bend through the deposition of concentric layers 

of semi-transparent chitin. Growth increments and apical lines are clearly visible inside 

both shoulders under transmitted light (Bizikov, 2004). In the case of Octopus pallidus the

nucleus looks pale with no discernable increments (Doubleday et al., 2006). The chemical 

composition of the matrix of the stylets is based on hydrated calcium phosphates (e.g. 

hydroxiapatite) and a fraction of the vestigial elements P, Cl and Ca, which can be used to 

differentiate increment bands (Doubleday et al., 2008; Marquez &amp;amp; Re, 2009; Napoleão et 

al., 2005).  

Stylets have recently been used successfully to assess age in wild populations of 

some octopus species (e.g. O. pallidus, Leporati et al., 2008; O. cyanea, Herwig et al., 

2012). The fast degradation of the structure upon contact with air and the abrasive 

techniques used to expose the growth structures are major concerns to the standardization 

of the techniques and their regular implementation. Nevertheless, new preparation methods 

are being developed, which appear to produce good quality stylet sections (Barratt &amp;amp; 

Allcock, 2010) and consequently the age determination by stylet increment analysis (SIA) 

is potentially an effective tool for the age determination in O. vulgaris, as was first 

advanced by Sousa-Reis &amp;amp; Fernandes (2002). It is also worth noting that the daily 

deposition of growth increments in the stylets of adults of this species was validated by 

Hermosilla et al. (2010) by staining the stylets with oxytetracycline and tetracycline, and 

comparing the number of rings produced after staining with the number of days elapsed. 

However, this marking of adult structures does not validate the age of an individual at first 

increment formation, essential for a rigorous age validation of the SIA in each species 

(Campana, 2001). The difficulties and potential inaccuracies associated with determining 

the age of merobenthic octopuses (such as O. vulgaris) using SIA and the importance of 

validating age at first increment formation are discussed in Doubleday et al. (2011). 

The present study aimed firstly to develop a technique to rapidly locate the stylets in 

the muscle of paralarvae, and secondly to determine the stylet size at hatching in newly 

hatched O. vulgaris paralarvae as a tool to define the starting point for age determination in 

stylets of later stages. Additionally, the stylets of three-day old paralarvae were compared 

to unknown age paralarvae captured in the wild to determine if the stylet nuclear area is 

conservative between paralarvae of different sizes and ages and between animals incubated 

at different temperatures.

Recently spawned eggs of O. vulgaris were raised in captivity at 18
o
C and 22

o
C. 

After hatching, three day-old paralarvae from both experimental temperatures were 

collected. Three-day old paralarvae were chosen to ensure some growth past the hatch 

check and permit the observation of increments if already formed. All paralarvae were 

preserved in 70% ethanol. Wild and captive paralarvae were measured under transmitted 

light binocular microscopy at 30 x magnification. Measurements were taken as follows: 

total length (TL in mm), mantle ventral length (ML in mm), eye diameter (D-eye in mm) 

and total weight (W in mg). 

To establish the most adequate protocol that could simultaneously permit the location 

and examination of several sections of the paralarval stylet, six captive individuals were 

embedded in paraffin and sectioned (in 6 µm width sections) according to three 

morphological planes: (A) the sagittal, (B) transversal, and (C) frontal planes (Figure 4.1). 

Sections were stained with acetic alcian blue solution (n = 3) and Masson’s trichrome (n = 

3) in order to enhance the fibrous nature of the stylets, by staining fibrin tissue in a solution 

of acetic alcian blue (adapted from Vecchione, 1991) or light green/blue (Jones, 2002), 

respectively. It was expectable that the staining would improve the identification of the 

structures inside the mantle and funnel muscles. Stained sections were observed under a 

binocular microscope equipped with transmitted light, at 400 x and 1000 x magnification. 

All sections were sequentially photographed. Taking into account the results of the 

experiment above, two groups of 3 day-old paralarvae (18ºC group and 22ºC group, n=20) 

and wild paralarvae (n=9) were subsequently sectioned in the transversal plane in 6 µm 

sections and stained with Masson’s Trichrome method. All sections were observed under 

transmitted light at a magnification of 400 x and 1000 x and photographed.

The elected transversal sections of the stylet (the best transversal section closer to the 

stylet bend), were used to identify the embryonic primordium or nucleus of the stylet and 

to estimate the diameter of the stylet at hatching. The nucleus is limited by a discontinuity 

which appears as a high-contrast micro-increment with a deeply darker zone under 

transmitted light, or an abrupt change in the micro-structural growth pattern (Panfili et al., 

2002). 

Stylet measurements were taken under 1000x magnification from the selected section 

of the stylet, as follows: stylet diameter (SD in µm), stylet perimeter (SP in µm), stylet area 

(SA in µm
2
), stylet major radius (SRmax in µm) and the radius of the nucleus (SRnucleus 

in µm). 

To assess the effect of temperature on paralarva and stylet sizes, size data were 

grouped according to the incubation temperature and sampling source, as “18ºC” and 

“22ºC” groups for paralarvae raised in captivity and “wild” group for the paralarvae 

collected during the mesozooplankton surveys. Prior to the statistical analysis, the 

assumptions of sample normality and homogeneity were assessed by group with Shapiro-

Wilk’s and Bartlett´s tests, respectively. A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to 

identify differences in mean measurements between groups, followed by a non-parametric 

post-hoc test whenever significant differences were found between mean values. 

Additionally, wild paralarvae of unknown age were collected in July and September 

2010 in Ría de Vigo (Southwest Galicia, Spain) during mesozooplankton surveys. These 

paralarvae were collected in depth and surface strata using a multitrawl (MultiNet
®
) 

sampler (0.71 × 0.71 m opening frame, see Roura (2013) for details). The wild paralarvae 

were stored in 70 % ethanol and measured similarly to the captive paralarvae. These were 

then transversally sectioned according to the protocol defined for captive paralarvae and 

stained with Hemotoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin. Selected sections were measured following the same 

procedure defined for the captive paralarvae. The wild paralarvae and respective stylet 

dimensions were compared with the captivity group with a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis 

test of variance.  

A Spearman correlation index was used to identify cases of collinearity between the 

measurements taken from the whole paralarva or the stylet, as well as to identify strong 

correlations between the size of the paralarva and measurements of the respective stylet.

4.1.3. Results  

As in adults, the stylets of O. vulgaris paralarvae were located at the insertion of the 

funnel retractor muscles, in the posterior region of the mantle. In relation to those of adults, 

in paralarvae these structures were situated more dorsally and mid region of the mantle 

(Figure 4.2). In the paralarva, the stylet bend (where the primordium of the structure is 

located) was found to lie between 100 ?m and 200 ?m from the tip of the mantle.

The use of Masson’s trichrome as a stain clearly improved the ability to locate the 

stylet inside the mantle – funnel retractor muscle insertion (compared to alcian blue).  Due 

to its ?-chitin nature similar to cartilage tissue, the stylet appeared stained in most 

paralarvae sections as green/blue. The stylet is anterior-posteriorly oriented in the mantle 

with the anterior branch (or rostrum) inserted deep inside the mantle muscle, the bend was 

located inside the mantle – funnel retractor muscle insertion, and the post-rostral branch 

positioned more superficially along the interior wall of the mantle (Figure 4.3). Several 

orientation experiments were made to obtain the best section of the stylet, frontal (Figure 

4.3), sagittal (Figure 4.4) and transversal planes of the paralarva (Figure 5). Although both 

sagittal and transversal plane sections gave good results in terms of locating the 

primordium, the transversal section improved the chances of obtaining good cross sections 

of the stylet near the bend (Figure 4.5). This transversal plane allowed firstly to identify the 

stylet at the bend level in the mantle-funnel retractor muscle insertion and then to identify 

the best section where it was possible to detect the hatch check in the stylet and to measure 

the diameter, perimeter, area and major radius of the stylet.

In the three day-old paralarvae, the mean diameter of the stylet (measured between 

the most distant points) was 3.99 ± 0.46 ?m and the mean area measured was 13.00 ± 6.13 

µm
2
. In those stylets, the nucleus was only identifiable in the sections near the bend. It was 

identified as a distinctively darker area circumscribed by one highly-contrasted micro-

increment (with a deeply darker zone), and within which first order growth rings are not 

observed. The mean diameter of the nucleus was 2.71 ± 0.42 ?m.

To determine the effect of temperature on stylet diameter as well as its variability, 

twenty cross sections of the stylet were measured and compared to the corresponding 

paralarval dimensions between “18ºC” and “22ºC” groups. Both paralarval dimensions and 

stylets measurements did not present any significant difference between the two groups 

(see Kruskal-Wallis comparison results for groups “18ºC” and “22ºC” in Table 4.1).

The nuclear area previously defined in the captive paralarvae was easily identified in 

the nine stylets of wild paralarvae by its microstructure. In the wild paralarva group, the 

diameter of the stylet measured 5.98 ± 0.95 µm and the area measured 27.54 ± 8.62 ?m
2
. 

The diameter of the stylet nucleus measured 3.02 ± 0.55 µm, and, it was only possible to 

identify the deposition of one growth increment in the post-nuclear area (Figure 2C) of the 

stylets of two wild paralarvae.  

When comparing paralarval and stylet measurements between the three-day old 

captive paralarvae and the unknown age wild paralarvae, statistically significant 

differences arise.  Paralarvae captured in the Rias Baixas presented significantly higher 

mean ML, TL, D-eye and weight in relation to the paralarvae for which the embryologic 

development occurred in captivity. Nevertheless, the diameter of the nucleus did not show 

significant differences between a combined captive group (“18ºC” and “22ºC” groups 

pooled together) and wild paralarvae (Table 4.1). 

 The comparison between paralarval measurements did not show any significant 

collinearity (Table 4.2).  On the other hand, for the stylet dimensions, significant 

collinearity was found between SD and SP (rs= 0.90, N = 29, P&amp;lt;0.001), between SD and 

SA (rs= 1.00, N = 29, P&amp;lt;0.001), between SD and SRmax (rs= 0.94, N = 29, P&amp;lt;0.001), and 

between SP and SRmax (rs= 0.90, N = 29, p &amp;lt;0.001) (Table 4.2). SRnucleus, was 

dependent on SDnucleus, but showed strong independence from other stylet dimensions. 

When comparing stylet dimensions with other paralarval dimensions, all combinations of 

measurements presented positive correlations to one another. The stronger correlations 

presented were between the diameter of the eye and the diameter and section area of the 

stylet and between the weight of the paralarva and stylet diameter and area (Table 4.2).  

Table 4.2 – Spearman correlation (rs) matrix. For comparisons between measurements of the same structure, 

rs&gt; 0.75 indicates collinearity. For comparisons between measurements of different structures, rs&gt; 0.50 

indicates correlation. For all cases, N = 29. * indicates significant correlation between variables (P &amp;lt;0.05).

4.1.4. Discussion 

To our knowledge, this is the first time that the vestigial shell (or stylet) was 

identified in pelagic paralarvae of a merobenthic octopus, proving its formation in a prior 

embryonic stage. In the adults of Octopus vulgaris, the stylet is a recognizable structure in 

the dorso-anterior region of the mantle, easily extracted by dissection. However, in newly 

hatched individuals, the body size and the fragile structure of non-mineralized chitin of the 

stylet make it particularly difficult to collect the stylets by dissection. Several methods to 

isolate and collect the stylet from the body of the paralarva were tried, including staining 

with an acetic alcian blue solution, in an adaptation of the method used by Vecchione 

(1991) to identify stomach contents in squids. According to that author, alcian blue 

efficiently stains cartilaginous structures such as eye rings and funnel/mantle-locking 

cartilages in squid paralarvae. We observed that, although the alcian blue successfully 

stained the eye lenses of O. vulgaris paralarvae, the staining achieved for the stylets was 

not effective and resulted in unclear structures.  

To overcome this difficulty and considering the fragile nature of newly-hatched 

paralarvae with the beaks and radula still under-developed, we chose to adopt a 

histological approach to obtain and observe sections of the stylets. Nevertheless, other 

challenges arise with this approach. As in adults, the stylets of paralarvae are spine-like 

rods with an irregular shape, presenting a middle bended region with concave and convex 

arms in the insertion area of the mantle-funnel retractor muscles. Both sagittal and 

transversal cutting planes result in good cross sections of the stylet, but only the transversal 

plane allowed a greater number of sections in the vicinity of the primordium. Additionally, 

this sectioning plane allowed the definition of a methodology to identify the bend and the 

closest section in which it is possible to identify the nucleus and to measure the structure in 

a replicable manner. 

 The nucleus (primordium) is visible in the nearest section to the stylet bend, with a 

mean diameter of 2.71 µm independently of the developmental temperature. The diameter 

of the stylet in newly-hatched (three-days old) paralarvae is close to 5 ?m. Under a 

magnification of 1000x, the stylet does not have visible growth rings in the majority of the 

sections. In only two stylets of the wild paralarvae group were post-nuclear growth 

increments visible. Smooth core regions seem to be particularly common in stylets of 

holobenthic octopus such as O. pallidus (Doubleday et al., 2006) and merobenthic octopus 

such as Macroctopus maorum (Doubleday et al., 2011). These observations are in

agreement with observations made in the stylets of adults, where it is possible to identify a 

core region with few irregularly marked increments (Figure 4.6). Nevertheless, one should 

hypothesise that the absence of visible growth increments near the nucleus may reflect an 

inadequate resolution power of light microscopy to resolve distances of less than 1 ?m 

(Campana, 1992; Doubleday et al., 2011) rather than an actual feature of the structure. The 

use of scanning electronic microscopy associated with cryo-sectioning of the paralarvae 

could be useful tools to improve the analysis of the stylet. 

 

Figure 4.6 – Octopus vulgaris juvenile and adult stylet sections showing the central area which corresponds 

in size to the stylet diameter at hatching (magnification 630x). SD – diameter of the stylet at hatching; A – 

stylet section of a juvenile weighing 384 g (SD = 3.5 ?m); B – stylet section of a juvenile weighting 700 gr 

(SD = 3.39 ?m).  

 

In Octopus vulgaris a merobenthic species, both stylet diameter and nuclear region of 

hatchlings are considerably smaller than in O. pallidus, a holobenthic species, but identical 

to stylet sizes and characteristics described by Doubleday et al. (2011) for Macroctopus 

maorum, a merobenthic octopus living in temperate and subantarctic waters off the 

Australian coast. In comparison with O. pallidus, O. vulgaris hatchlings are small and 

pelagic until settlement 30 to 60 days after hatching (Villanueva, 1995; Villanueva &amp;amp; 

Norman, 2008), while O. pallidus hatchlings are larger in relation to their adults and 

benthic from hatching. This results in two orders of magnitude difference in weight (2 mg 

weight for O. vulgaris hatchlings vs. 0.10 to 0.54 g for O. pallidus hatchlings, Semmens et 

al. 2011) at hatching and fully accounts for size differences between stylet diameter and 

nuclear area. Such differences illustrate the importance of investigating and validating 

growth structures and check marks in the stylets of each species.

Comparing our observations between O. vulgaris paralarva and juvenile stylet 

sections it is possible to observe correspondences of the nuclear area among the two life 

stages (Figure 6). In the juveniles, the identified nucleus ranges between 3 and 5 ?m in 

diameter, followed by a smooth region where growth increments are hardly visible, 

necessarily larger than observed in these paralarvae. Nevertheless, the dimensions of the 

nuclear area are within the same range in both stages (paralarvae and juveniles).  

 The three day-old captivity-hatched paralarvae of which the embryologic 

development was conducted under controlled temperatures did not show significant 

differences in either body size or stylet dimensions. These findings are consistent with 

results obtained in laboratory essays under similar developmental temperatures: 18ºC and 

21ºC. Although embryos at warmer temperatures grow faster and hatch earlier, hatchlings 

do not present significant differences in size or weight (Baptista et al., pers. comm.). It is 

important to note that these paralarvae were not fed during the first three days of life, 

which could influence growth. Working with squid, Vidal et al. (2002) suggested that in 

the first hours to days of life, even if they start to feed, paralarvae depend almost entirely 

on their yolk reserves, going through a two-stage critical period with a “no net growth”, 

comprised of a negative phase (decreasing in weight) and a posterior positive phase 

(weight recovery). In our study, the paralarvae were not fed and there was no recovery 

phase, so only a negative grow-phase was present. However the two groups might have 

been different at hatching and different net negative growth phase between the 18ºC and 

22ºC could have resulted in similar weights and sizes at the end of the three days. 

 We were not able to determine the age of the nine paralarvae captured in the Cies 

Islands. Those paralarvae were in all cases larger in size and weight than the ones hatched 

in captivity, indicating that they may be over three-days old. The results of studies 

conducted by Villanueva (1995) with O. vulgaris hatchlings reared at 21ºC, suggest that 

these paralarvae could be approximately 10-days old (Figure 4.7). Nevertheless, these 

larvae were captured in July and October experiencing mean surface temperatures between 

16.5 ºC (for the July paralarvae) and 19.2 ºC (for the October paralarvae) during 

embryologic development (SST data source: Seawatch buoy located off Cape Silleiro , 42º 

7.80 N, 9º 23.40 W, www.puertos.es). This means that on average these paralarvae 

experienced lower temperatures that those in captivity, resulting in a longer embryologic 

development (Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008; Moreno et al., 2012) and therefore larger sizes 

at hatching (Leporati et al., 2007). Even though the nucleus is the same diameter between 



4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile 

 

155 

 

wild-caught and captive-hatched paralarvae, body size, stylet area and diameter and major 

radius are all larger in the wild paralarvae, which indicates that deposition of new material 

in the stylet after hatching had occurred, although no increments were observed. One can 

hypothesize that at this stage the deposition of growth increments does not happen daily or 

that their contrast is not sufficient to show. During the paralarval stage, individuals go 

through a dramatic change from endogenous feeding to exogeneous feeding (Boletzky, 

2003; Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008) associated to a no-net growth (Moguel et al., 2010) 

and a learning to hunt process that is not cyclic. Either during this process growth 

increment deposition depends on other factors that are not regulated by circadian 

mechanisms, or the composition of the deposition layers is not very different. Either 

possibility may have resulted in a single increment deposition having been observed in two 

paralarvae.  

 

Figure 4.7 - Comparison of the mean weight of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae of known age reared under 

different temperatures (18ºC 3day, 22ºC 3day, 21ºC 1 day* and 21ºC 3 day*). Data for the 21ºC 1 and 21ºC 

10 day paralarvae were published in Villanueva (1995). 

 

Despite the significant differences in paralarvae and stylet measurements between 

groups, the dimension of the nuclear region in the stylet seem to be conservative between 

them and independent of both biological and environmental factors, suggesting that the 

nuclear region (corresponding to stylet size at hatching) can be used as a reference point to 

determine age and growth and related measurements. More studies on the stylet structure

are however needed to understand how the structure grows in both girth and length at this 

pre-settlement stage.

ABSTRACT 

Age and growth estimates are essential to understand the life cycle of Octopus vulgaris including 

the time span of paralarvae, juvenile and fully mature individuals. Stylet increment analysis, SIA, is 

one of the most promising methods to accurately estimate age and growth rate in wild populations 

of O. vulgaris. Despite the recent developments to improve SIA some challenges remain including 

the definition of protocols to achieve age precision. Here, we estimate the age and growth rates of 

O. vulgaris juveniles hatched along the Portuguese coast based on the daily deposition of growth 

increments in their stylets. A counting protocol designed to achieve age precision is described. 

According to our results, O. vulgaris juveniles grow following a logarithmic model with an 

instantaneous growth rate of 6.2 % d
-1

 and take approximately 11 months to attain 750 g, the 

minimum commercial size established in Portuguese fisheries regulations.

4.2.1. Introduction 

Age and growth estimates are essential to understand the biology and ecology of 

marine organisms. These estimates are important for stock assessment using population 

age structured models, longevity and mortality models, productivity and recruitment 

models, all important tools for sustainable fisheries management. Ecologically, the 

assessment of age and growth rates permit the determination of the duration of crucial life 

stages (e.g. paralarva), and the timing of important transitional stages (e.g. settlement). 

Furthermore, environmental impacts on growth can be assessed based on age and growth 

estimates throughout the species life cycle. 

In cephalopods, estimates of age and growth have been conducted applying both 

indirect methods based in demographic and modal progression methods and direct methods 

from hard structures. The direct methods of age estimation are based on counts of growth 

increments (GI) in the statoliths (González et al., 1996; Moreno et al., 2005), beaks 

(Perales-Raya et al., 2010; 2014; Canali et al., 2011), internal shell (Ré &amp;amp; Narciso, 1994) 

and the stylets (vestigial shell) supported by a few studies associated to mark-recapture and 

daily deposition validation techniques (see Semmens et al., 2004, and Boyle &amp;amp; Rodhouse, 

2006 for a review). Additionally, some biochemical and histochemical methods have been 

used to assess individual age in cephalopods as the RNA/protein ratio in Eledone cirrhosa 

and Octopus vulgaris (Pierce et al., 1999) and lipofuscin pigment concentration in the 

optic gland of O. pallidus (Doubleday &amp;amp; Semmens, 2011).  

In Incirrate octopods such as O. vulgaris, direct ageing methods based on statolith 

increment analysis are not considered accurate, while approaches using beaks still need 

accuracy validation, in particular due to erosion by feeding (Perales-Raya et al., 2010, 

2014; Canali et al., 2011). 

The use of the stylets to assess age has been trialed in the past (e.g. Reis &amp;amp; 

Fernandes, 2002) with improvements achieved in the preservation and observation 

techniques in transversal sections of these structures. Today, age estimation by stylet 

increment analysis (SIA) is considered a successful and promising method to assess age in 

wild populations of octopus species (e.g. O. pallidus, Leporati et al., 2008; Macroctopus 

maorum, Doubleday et al., 2011, O. cyanea, Herwig et al., 2012;). Important contributions 

on validation of daily deposition of GI in O. pallidus were made by Doubleday et al. 

(2006) and Leporati et al., (2008) and in O. vulgaris by Hermosilla et al. (2010). Recent 

improvements in stylet preparation methods that resulted in the production of good quality 



4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile 

 

161 

 

and definitive sections (Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock, 2010) definitively push forward the use of SIA 

to estimate age in octopus species. 

Despite the growing number of studies on age and growth based on the count of 

growth increments in transverse sections of stylets in incirrate octopods, few efforts have 

been conducted to follow identical counting protocols between species as is the case of age 

studies based on fish otoliths (Panfili et al., 2002). The definition of a protocol for ageing 

purposes allows comparisons to be made between different populations of the same species 

or between species with different life strategies, e.g. compare growth and lifespan 

estimates between holobenthic and merobenthic species. 

O. vulgaris is a merobenthic species (Mangold, 1983) with a short life cycle of one 

(Iglesias et al., 2004; Perales-Raya et al., 2014) to two years (Katsanevakis &amp;amp; 

Verriopoulos, 2006; Otero et al., 2007). The paralarvae are planktonic and settle to the 

benthic habitat (weighing 173 mg) 32 to 57 days after hatching (Villanueva, 1995; Iglesias 

et al., 2004; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). Upon settling grow rates are high, at 

approximately 1.2-1.6% d
-1

, allowing animals to reach the fisheries legal minimum landing 

weight (750 g in Portugal, Portaria nº 27/2001) at 9-10 months of age (Domain et al., 2000; 

Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos, 2006). The stylet develops throughout embryogenesis, 

probably as a single piece (Budelmann et al., 1997; Naef, 1921, 1923 in Bizikov, 2004) 

and at hatching it is located in the dorso-anterior region of the mantle (Lourenço et al., 

unpublished data). 

The present study aims to estimate the age of O. vulgaris juveniles (pre-recruits) of 

the Portuguese northwest coast (western Iberian upwelling system, WIUS) using SIA. 

Secondly, it aims to provide a protocol for stylet preparation and SIA methods, based on 

Doubleday et al. (2006) and Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock (2010) and the daily deposition validation 

conducted by Hermosilla et al. (2010), such that repeated and comparable age estimates 

can be made between populations and between various incirrate octopods species to a 

higher precision than hereto possible, providing greater ageing accuracy.  

 

4.2.2. Material and methods 

4.2.2.1. Sampling and storing 

Twenty-eight stylets collected from pre-recruits weighing between 99 g and 748 g 

captured in the small-scale fisheries were stored in a 4% formalin solution. For each

individual (yielding a pair of stylets), dorsal mantle length (DML in mm) and total weight 

(W in g) were measured to the nearest mm and 0.1 g, respectively. Sex and maturity stage 

were macroscopically evaluated whenever possible.  

Previous studies have highlighted that storing solutions are a key issue in the prevention of 

stylet degradation and improvement of GI visualization (Sousa-Reis &amp;amp; Fernandes, 2002). 

To find the best storing solution, two sets of stylets were stored in a 3:1 mixture of 70% 

ethanol and glycerol (solution A), and in a 4% formalin solution (solution B). The core 

region of several stylets stored in solution A appeared darkened, layers were easily 

separated from each other during preparation due to drying, and no improvement in the 

visualization of GI was observed. Solution B revealed to be a better storing solution: 

drying was less significant and counting of GI comparatively easier. 

 

4.2.2.2. Stylet preparation 

Before resin embedding, the entire stylet was dehydrated in sequential baths of 70%, 

80% and 100% ethanol for two hours each. After dehydration, a section of the stylet with 

roughly 1 cm long (including the stylet bend) was cut towards the post-rostral region. The 

section was then embedded in a low-viscosity acrylic resin (LR White
TM

) for 24 h in an 

Eppendorf after Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock (2010). Following resin infiltration, the stylet section 

was removed from the solution and placed horizontally in a plastic histology mould. 

Approximately 50 ml of fresh resin was polymerized using 5 drops of accelerator solution 

(LR White
TM

 UV accelerator) filling up the mould until the stylet section was completely 

covered. The section orientation inside the mould was corrected before resin hardening. 

This operation was conducted over a cold plate at – 8 ºC to prevent resin overheating. The 

embedded stylets were left overnight to polymerize. After polymerization, the resin blocks 

were removed from the plastic moulds, lined up over a fresh epoxy resin layer and oriented 

vertically with the stylet bend facing up. They were then covered with transparent epoxy 

resin and left to dry overnight. The new epoxy resin block was cut with a variable speed 

precision cutting machine (Extec's Labcut 250B) blade producing 500 ?m transversal 

sections of the stylets. This new step was introduced in the procedure following the 

protocols designed by Doubleday et al. (2006) and Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock (2010). It facilitates 

the production of identical 500 µm stylet sections, minimizing the occurrence of variable 

section thicknesses which would require considerable time in grinding. The 500 µm 

sections were then removed from the base resin, mounted onto a glass slide with Neo-

R
 and left to dry for a further 24 h untill completely hard. They were then further 

ground and polished with a sequence 1200-grade Carborundum fine sandpaper, followed 

by a sequence of 30, 9 and 3 µm lapping film and finally wet neoprene impregnated with a 

solution of 0.05 µm aluminum oxide powder and distilled water (after Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock, 

2010). During polishing, the sections were checked under a light microscope (100 and 

400x magnification) until GI, nucleus and core region were visible, while making sure they 

would not get polished away. 

 

4.2.2.3. Stylet microstructure analysis and age estimation 

Stylet microstructure and GI were observed at 100 and 625x magnifications using a 

Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging light microscope. Sequential digital images of the whole stylet 

section were captured under 100x magnification with a Zeiss Axiocam MRC digital 

camera and composed digitally using ImageJ plugin MosaicJ (Thévenaz &amp;amp; Unser, 2007). 

The nucleus was identified in 13 stylets and appeared in the center of the stylet as a 

dark portion limited by the first growth discontinuity or check identified by the a colour 

change from dark to light grey. The diameter of this portion was on average 5.8 ± 2.2 µm, 

similar to the diameter of the stylet of a three-day old paralarva (3.99 ± 0.96 µm, Lourenço 

et al., unpublished data). Considering that this was the first growth discontinuity visible 

after the nucleus, we considered it the hatch check (Lourenço et al., unpublished data). 

The transversal section of the stylet presented an irregular shape and the nucleus 

divided the stylet surface in two unequal parts. In order to have reproducible GI counts, 

two reading segments were defined along the stylet’s major axis and called large segment 

and small segment depending of the length of each. 

The core region was identified in all stylets as the region between the hatch check 

and the second growth discontinuity. The core region was defined as a smooth region 

where none or few growth increments were visible due to increments low contrast. The 

core region presented a variable diameter, ending where regular deposition of the GI is 

visible under the microscope.  

Measurements of the area, perimeter, major axis, minor axis, core region (radius) and 

nucleus (diameter) were taken from the scaled mosaics (Figure 4.8) and compared to 

individual weight, dorsal mantle length and number of GI. The assumption of normality 

and homogeneity of the variables was assessed with Shapiro-Wilk’s and Bartlett´s tests,

respectively, and the correlation matrix of the dimensions was obtained applying the 

Pearson correlation index.

axis and major axis with arrows indicating of the large and small counting segments along the stylet’s major 

axis (mosaic of images with 100x magnification).   

GI were observed under bright light, with the condenser adjusted to optimize 

brightness and contrast. To count GI in each stylet, a sequential series of 625x 

magnification grayscale images were captured along the stylet’s major axis and composed 

digitally using the ImageJ plugin MosaicJ (Thévenaz&amp;amp; Unser, 2007).  

Based on the validation conducted by Hermosilla et al. (2010) of the daily deposition 

of GI in the stylets of O. vulgaris, GI counts were conducted under 625x magnifications 

along the small and large segments. A daily GI was defined as the set of a light grey (or 

white) band followed by a dark ring and the increment count was marked in the latter. At 

this stage, the first increment was defined as the nearest clear dark ring after the nucleus 

defining the end of the core region (Figure 4.9 A). The last increment was defined as the 

most marginal dark ring. The light band was always wider than the dark ring, and 

frequently presented several very fine dark rings or shadows within it, that were considered

sub-daily growth increments (Figure 4.9B).  

The distance between consecutive increments was determined by dividing the 

distance between the first GI and the last GI by the number of GI counted. To asses if the 

number of increments counted was independent of the axis length, three independent 

counts were made on both large and small axis. The segment length and correspondent 

counts were statistically compared by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and differences 

found between segment counts were assessed by a paired t-Student test for differences 

between group means.

The precision of age estimates was defined as the reproducibility of repeated counts 

(Campana, 2001). The precision can be assessed by the average percent error (APE), the 

index of precision (D) or by the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV tends to be the 

preferential method used for microstructure studies because it is more robust and more 

sensitive to differences between observers (Campana, 2001). The CV can be written as

, where CVj is the estimate for age precision of the jth stylet. 

Xij is the ith age determination of the jth stylet, Xj is the mean age estimate for the jth 

stylet, and R is the number of times each stylet is aged. The CV of age estimates was 

determined per observer based on three independent GI counts made by experienced 

observers (A) (CVWO) and between observers by comparing the mean GI counts of 

observer A with an independent GI count of a second experienced observer (B) (CVBO). 

Additionally, the relative precision between readers was tested by comparing the slopes 

and intercepts of regressions of number of GI on axis length, as determined by each reader, 

through an analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) (Quinn &amp;amp; Keough, 2002). 

 The GI counts results obtained by observer A over the large segment were used to fit 

different growth models. To describe the growth of O. vulgaris after settlement, four 

different growth models (linear, exponential, logarithmic and power models) were fitted to 

the weight-at-age data. The best fit model was selected by checking the model fit residuals 

for normality with Shapiro-Wilk’s test and by calculating the Akaike Information Criterion 

(AIC) of fitted results (Zuur et al., 2007). Post-settlement instantaneous growth rates 

(IGR’s) were calculated on an individual basis but averaged over the lifetime based on the 

equation determined by Forsythe &amp;amp; Van Heukelem (1987):

4.2.3. Results: 

 

The stylet dimensions, minor axis, major axis, perimeter and area are highly 

correlated with each other and with the juveniles’ dml and weight. The core region radius 

and the nucleus diameter are independent of the other dimensions of both stylets and 

juveniles. Table 4.3 present the correlation between the stylet dimensions and the juvenile 

dimensions.

Twenty-two sections of the 28 stylets collected were observed and GI counted. This 

means that 21% of the stylets collected were lost due to processing damage. GI counts 

were made in 95 % to 99 % of the segments length.  

The comparison of counts between large and small segments of the major axis, 

showed that in 50% of the stylets GI counts are significantly different between the 

segments (Figure 4.11) with differences found between counts increasing with the 

increasing differences in the segments size. Considering this, the distance between GI is 

conservative among segments (DLS = 4.29 ± 0.62 (SD) µm; DSS = 4.56 ± 0.74 (SD) µm). 

The average CVWO determined was low (5.15%) ranging between 1.57 % and 9.93 %. The 

average CVBO increased to 8.78 %, ranging between 0 % (total agreement) and 23.08 %.

Segment length, GI counts and mean distance between GI were compared by 

observer with ANOVA and results showed that, although no significant differences were 

found between observers GI counts (F = 1.914, p-value = 0.174), the mean distance 

between GI was significantly different (F = 10.86, p-value = 0.002). These results are 

supported by the ANCOVA analysis (Table 4.3). ANCOVA showed that even if there is no 

effect of the categorical factor observer in the relationship between segment length and 

number of GI counted (interaction effect model results: F = 0.013, p-value = 0.90), 

observer B tends to count more GI than observer A.

Juvenile dorsal mantle measured between 70 mm and 145 mm in length with 

individual weight ranging between 98.57 g and 748 g (12 females and 10 males). GI counts 

ranged between 59 and 219 increments. Assuming that the deposition of the growth 

increments identified occurs on a daily basis, the first GI counted determines the end of the 

core region and probably matches with settlement. Stylets sections observed therefore 

correspond to octopus which settled at between two and seven months prior to being 

caught (Table 4.4). 

 

GIs counted by stylet were compared with major segment axis length, perimeter and 

core region radius using linear regression. Results show that the number of GI is linearly 

correlated and increases with increasing size of the stylet (in perimeter, area and major axis 

length) with the exception of the radius of the core region with which no relationship exists 

(Figure 4.12).

Considering that the number of GI counted corresponds to the time in days elapsed 

between settlement and capture, different growth models were fit to weight-at-age data. 

Table 4.5 presents the growth model parameters and the AIC obtained. In all cases, the 

growth parameter b estimate was significant, while growth parameter a was only 

significant for the exponential and logarithmic models. Based on the AIC, weight-at age 

data were best described by a linear model. Based on the fitted growth parameters and on 

previous knowledge of the biology of the species, the model that appears to better explain 

growth is the logarithmic model (Figure 4.13 A). Based on the lower AIC result (Table 4.5) 

and the previously knowledge of the biology of the species, the model that best fits IGR 

results is the power model (Figure 4.13 B).

4.2.4. Discussion: 

The methodology used to prepare the stylets to SIA was time consuming and 

produced a 21% loss of material. The introduction of the automated 500 µm section was an 

improvement regarding the previous age studies with SIA (Barrat &amp;amp; Allcock, 2010; 

Doubleday et al., 2006). However, the high percentage of stylet damage from layer 

detachment is still high, making this a time and material demanding technique. Reducing 

the storing time prior to sectioning can probably reduce detachment from layer 

dehydration, but the discontinued nature of the layered deposition of the stylet matrix will 

always be a limiting factor for the optimization of the technique.

Figure 4.13 - Growth model (A) and instantaneous growth rate model (B) fits to Octopus vulgaris juvenile 

weight – at –age data. 

 

Age estimation based on SIA now appears to be a promising accurate method when 

used for octopus species. Since the preliminary work conducted by Sousa-Reis &amp;amp; 

Fernandes (2002), several advances in methodological approaches have been achieved, 

including the possibility to prepare permanent resin embedded sections (Barratt &amp;amp; Allcock, 

2010) and the daily deposition validation in holobenthic (Doubleday et al., 2006; Leporati 

et al., 2007) and merobenthic (Hermosilla et al., 2010) octopods. In fact, the possibility to 

have permanent section preparations assures samples will remain available for continued 

improvements to observation protocols. Here, for the first time, independent GI counts 

were conducted in different regions of the stylet proving that the choice of the region of 

interest to conduct GI counts is determining to age assessing particularly in the most 

irregular stylet sections. 

 Since the daily deposition of GI in stylets has been validated by Hermosilla et al. 

(2010) for O. vulgaris, this is the first study in which wild post-settled juveniles were aged 

with SIA. According to our results, post-settlement O. vulgaris took a minimum of eight 

months to reach the 750 g minimum landing size required from Portuguese legislation. The 

average instantaneous growth rate estimated during this period is 6.26% per day, but IGR 

decreases continuously from settlement, following a power function. 

 Albeit promising for the accurate and precise assessment of the age of O. vulgaris, 

the described SIA methodologies require the establishment of specific protocols. The prior 

definition of a region of interest (ROI) in the stylet surface facilitates precise age estimates 

using SIA because it removes a source of variability, since the distance between GI can 

vary. Since GI were visible in more than 90 % of the stylet surface, and the major axis

(with the greatest distance between GI) was therefore established a priori as the ROI for 

counts. Stylet section shape is asymmetric and, in most cases, the nucleus is not located at 

the center of the structure, resulting in counting segments with different lengths depending 

of their position in relation to the nucleus. Observers tend to use the distance between 

increments as the main criterion to distinguish daily from sub-daily growth increments, and 

therefore the counts produced over different length segments tend to be different and the 

difference increases with increasing length differences between segments. In age studies 

conducted with squid statoliths, the more frequent ROI defined a priori is the region 

between the nucleus an the rostrum in the lateral dome of the statoliths (Lipinski &amp;amp; 

Durholtz, 1994; Arkhipkin &amp;amp; Bjorke, 2000; Moreno et al., 2005) for similar reasons. 

Despite our best efforts, a mean CV of 9% between observers was the most precise 

estimate achieved, which is considerably high in comparison with age studies on other 

octopus species (Herwig et al., 2012; Leporati et al., 2008). The associated error can 

therefore produce underestimated ages by 3% to 4%, considering a theoretical life span of 

between 18 months (Domain et al., 2000) and two years (Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 

2006; Otero et al., 2007).  

The use of a magnification of 625x permitted the identification of the nucleus in only 

59 % of the stylets observed (13 sections). The nucleus presents characteristics which 

resemble in size those of the stylet at hatching, as previously defined. However, the 

nucleus of the stylets observed in the present study, with a mean diameter of 5.80 µm, are 

statistically different (t = -2.78, df = 15.12, p-value = 0.01) from the stylet diameter of 

three-day old paralarvae (3.99 µm, Lourenço et al., unpublished data). In comparison with 

the holobenthic species O. pallidus (Doubleday et al., 2006) the nuclear area of the stylets 

of O. vulgaris, which would correspond to hatching size, is proportionately smaller, 

similarly to the ratio of post-hatching size / adult size of the two species. This extremely 

small size in conjunction with the existence of the core region, which has not yet been fully 

explained, may account for the verified difference in size between hatching stylet diameter 

and nuclear diameter in juvenile and adult specimens.  

The stylet nucleus is located at the center of the core region, which is defined as a 

smooth, mostly unmarked (due to low contrast increments) area of variable size. The core 

region ends with the deposition of a checkmark which marks the beginning of a regular 

deposition of rings that extend to the outer edge of the stylet. Number of GI, distance 

between GI and core region size all seem to be independent of stylet section size and 



4. Assessing age in Octopus vulgaris juvenile

octopus size suggesting that post-core ring deposition is the only source of a relationship 

between section size and octopus size (and in some way age). The core region has also 

been identified in M. maorum, another merobenthic octopus (Doubleday et al., 2011b). 

Based on knowledge of the pre-hatching formation of the stylet and its size in three-day 

old paralarvae (Lourenço et al., unpublished data), it is possible to hypothesize that the 

core region is formed throughout a relatively long period after hatching, while the 

paralarva undergoes its pelagic existence, and that probably the first checkmark is layed 

when the paralarva changes into a juvenile at settlement to the benthic habitat. In fact, the 

radius of the core region was on average 382 µm. Considering that the mean distance 

between GI was estimated to be 4.29 µm and assuming that the GI deposition was regular 

during the entire life of the juveniles, we can estimate that at least 88 GI could be deposited 

between hatch and settlement marks, corresponding to about 3 months. Although, 

representing a significantly longer paralarval stage than the results obtained by Villanueva 

(1995) on captive paralarvae would suggest (they settled 60 days after hatching), it is in 

line with estimates made by Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos (2006) from density studies, 

which indicated paralarval stage lengths of three to four months depending on water 

temperature (colder waters leading to longer paralarval stages). 

Support for a conservative nuclear size has been gained from this study, which in 

turn would support a conservation of the hatchling stylet diameter as the nucleus of the 

developing structure. It is then possible that the core region somewhat masks nuclear 

dimensions, making it more difficult to determine nuclear dimensions in larger individuals. 

Albeit generally featureless, 5 to 23 low contrasts GI are usually visible in the core 

region. It would therefore stand to reason that whatever dictates the deposition of GI, either 

their period or their characteristics vary throughout the life of the individual. Therefore, in 

complement to the validation of the daily deposition of GI in adults, it is also necessary to 

attempt to validate it in other life stages. During juvenile and adult life stages, the animals 

are benthic and the daily deposition of GI is probably related with the circadian activity 

controlled by the light cycle, even if directly it is dictated by hunting or actual feeding 

success (Wells et al., 1983; Meisel et al., 2003). If factors such as feeding success play a 

role, the variability of possible outcomes may also explain the variability observed in the 

thickness and other characteristics of the individual GI. Paralarvae are pelagic, and other 

than being subject to external cues, they may also modulate these cues via their own 

behaviour, collectively the zeitgeber, which includes dial migrations, light or temperature

cycles, feeding success, etc., all of which influence their metabolism during this stage. 

Considering those differences in the external factors that influence behaviour and 

metabolism, it is essential to take validation methods to another level (Doubleday et al., 

2011b) in order to adequately interpret the whole extent of the assumed age record. 

Individuals weighing between 99 g and 748 g take 59 to 219 days after settlement to 

attain those weights. Having in mind that complete age results might be underestimated 

due to the difficulties in identifying daily GI in the core region, up to 3 months should be 

added relating to the paralarval stage. We therefore estimate that such juveniles might be 

conservatively aged at 5 to 10 months. These age estimates are higher than those obtained 

by Perales-Raya et al. (2010, 2014) for the same weight range from beak growth increment 

analysis. The O. vulgaris population of the Central East Atlantic studied by Perales-Raya et 

al. (2010, 2014) is subject to higher environmental temperatures than those experienced by 

the population studied here (which is influenced by the Western Iberian upwelling system - 

WIUS). Different environmental temperatures are known to influence growth rates 

(Forsythe, 1993), lower temperatures leading to slower weight gains. This could explain 

the different results obtained here in comparison with Perales-Raya et al. (2010). On the 

other hand, age estimates conducted by Canali et al. (2011) in beaks of population of O. 

vulgaris from the Bay of Naples (western Mediterranean Sea) show that animals weighing 

on average 350 g are aged between 72 days and 371 days, a wide age range for such small 

animals, even considering that Mediterranean populations attain smaller sizes than Atlantic 

populations (Quetglas et al., 1998). Studies on beak growth increments, such as those 

conducted by Perales-Raya et al. (2010, 2014) and Canali et al. (2011) are however 

sometimes also questioned due to the unknown level of beak increment erosion induced by 

feeding. 

Despite the high variability in age estimates, the model that best explained growth at 

this pre-maturity stage was the logarithmic model. This is in accordance with the review 

conducted by Forsythe &amp;amp; Van Heukelem (1987) for laboratory-based growth in cephalopod 

species in general. They show that growth in benthic octopods occurs in two phases, the 

first being exponential, and the second logarithmic. During the logarithmic phase, 

individuals were never shown to reach an asymptote, contrary to the study of Domain et al. 

(2000), but growth rates decreased progressively. In the present study, the instantaneous 

growth rate estimated with a power model was on average 6.26 % d
-1

, which is low when 

compared to estimates by Iglesias et al. (2004) for captive animals and high when

compared to the direct estimates by Domain et al. (2000) or the demographic model 

produced by Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verriopoulos (2006).  

 The variability in age estimates obtained through different methods highlights the 

importance of validation studies, among which those based on wild-caught specimens 

would be particularly relevant (Perales-Raya et al., 2014). Validations of daily deposition 

of GI in different stages of the life cycle are then also necessary. In the case of O. vulgaris 

(and possibly other merobenthic species) this validation is essential to understand the 

differences that are apparent in different regions of the stylet. 

 Finally, adequate ageing protocols are also essential to allow repeatable and 

comparable exercises between octopus populations and researchers. The definition a priori 

of count areas (e.g. the larger segment of the major axis) will enhance counts comparison 

within and between individuals (or populations). Additionally, improving the structures 

contrast introducing differential interference contrast filters to the observation with the 

400x and 625x magnification objectives will improve the GI contrast particularly in the 

core region, which is, at this stage, the most difficult and demanding stylet region in terms 

of identification and GI counting. Hand-in-hand with the validation of GI deposition in the 

paralarval stage, the increasing contrast of the GI laid in the stylet will be the most 

significant methodological aspect to improve to obtain precise and accurate age estimates 

to the Incirrate octopuses’ species.

5. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  

 

5.1.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  
 

The Octopus vulgaris population of the northeastern Atlantic is very important from 

a socioeconomic perspective. The coastal fishing communities of Portugal and Galicia fish 

an average of 14 911 tons of common octopus each year (FAO 2014; INE 2013) mainly 

through the small-scale fishing fleet (Freire &amp;amp; Garc??a-Allut, 2000; ICES 2012a), and 

increasingly in the latest years, the bottom-trawling fleet (Fonseca et al., 2008). 

Characterized by high abundance variability mainly related with the impact of different 

environmental factors in the paralarval and juvenile stages (González et al., 2005; Otero et 

al., 2008; 2009; Sobrino et al., 2002; Sonderblohm et al., 2014), the resilience of the 

species to heavy fishing is, most certainly, related with its plastic life-strategy (Hastie et 

al., 2009), the highly productive coastal conditions of the Northeastern Atlantic coastal 

basin (Arístegui et al., 2009; García Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007; Relvas et al., 2007), the 

opportunistic feeding behaviour of the adults (Quetglas et al., 1998) and the availability of 

several potential prey assemblages (Sousa et al., 2005).  

In the coastal basin of the northeast Atlantic, Octopus vulgaris spawn year-round 

(Hastie et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the northeast Atlantic population presents seasonal 

trends that differ from north to south. While in Galician waters the population spawns 

mainly in spring (Otero et al., 2007), we observed that in southern waters near 

Estremadura Promontory (39º N) the spawning season extends from early spring until the 

end of summer, with intensity peaks in February-April and  June-July, coupled to seasonal 

upwelling (Lourenço et al., 2012). In the southern section of the Iberian Atlantic basin  the 

spawning season is shorter occurring in summer and peaking in September (Lourenço et 

al., 2012) similarly to neighbouring eastern waters between the River Guadiana mouth and 

Cádiz (Silva et al., 2002). In this area, the primary production seasonality is not as 

pronounced, being mainly driven by the west-east wind pattern, river runoff associated to 

raining periods and strong water column stratification with significant warming of sea 

surface waters (García Lafuente &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2007; Ruiz et al., 2006). The O. vulgaris 

population takes advantage of these conditions, channelling more energy for spawning in a 

shorter period of time (higher Gonad-somatic index attained by females in this area), in the 



5. General Conclusions 

 

182 

 

end of summer, timing paralarval hatching to winter, when the predominant westerly winds 

favour the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near to the Cape Stª Maria (Ruiz et al., 

2006).   

On an individual basis, females and males seem to have different reproductive 

strategies. Males attain maturity at smaller sizes (Lourenço et al., 2012) and maintain 

spawning capacity for a longer period than females (both to senescence). Females couple 

their reproductive strategy with environmental conditions (Lourenço et al., 2012) 

guaranteeing the best survival chances for their offspring. The onset of maturation and 

energy allocation to maturation depend on individual weight and body condition. However, 

the lack of a correlation (in the case of males) or the inverse correlation (in the case of 

females) between total body weight (and digestive gland) and gonad weight (Lourenço et 

al., 2012), and between the nutritional profiles of the digestive gland and the mature gonad 

(Lourenço et al., 2014) show that both males and mature females channel energy directly 

from food to reproduction supporting the hypothesis that O. vulgaris is an income breeder 

(Houston et al., 2006; Quetglas et al., 2011) and whenever the environmental and feeding 

conditions are favourable (increasing body condition), the maturation process is triggered.  

Independently of maturity stage, the lipid content and fatty acids profile in the 

digestive gland seems to offer a good indication of the nutritional condition of the 

population (Lourenço et al., 2014). The function of the digestive gland as a reservoir in 

cephalopods has been under discussion (Blanchier &amp;amp; Boucaud-Camou, 1984; García et al., 

2011; García-Garrido et al., 2010; Moguel et al., 2010; Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp; Johnston, 

2006) for long, evidence suggesting that although cephalopods have a protein based 

metabolism (Lee, 1995), polar lipids play an important role as constituents of the 

lipoproteins that form the cells membrane (Navarro et al., 2014) and the digestive gland 

plays an important role in lipid metabolism (Moguel et al., 2010; Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp; 

Johnston, 2006). Here, we showed that the FA profile found in the digestive gland of 

females of populations under different environmental conditions reflects the nutrients 

available, mainly in the PUFA and MUFA profile but also in the n-3HUFA/n-6HUFA and 

DHA/EPA ratios (Lourenço et al., 2014). 

With a short life cycle (one to two years) and absence of generation overlap, 

population resilience and the success of recruitment to fisheries are supported by the 

biological and physical conditions that paralarvae and juveniless find prior to settlement, 

during and immediately post settlement. The paralarval stage and the transition stage 



5. General Conclusions 

 

183 

 

between paralarva and juvenile are the phases when most significant changes occur in 

morphology, habitat and behaviour (including feeding behaviour) and also when higher 

rates of natural mortality occur (see Robin et al., 2014 for a review on the role of habitat, 

environment, functional morphology and behaviour in the transitions of the life history of 

cephalopods). It is therefore important to understand which of the environmental 

parameters (physical and nutritional) contribute to survival and recruitment success. Local 

factors that most correlate with the higher abundances of O. vulgaris paralarvae in the 

spawning area of the Ría de Vigo were investigated, showing that shallow waters protected 

from physical disturbance offer the best brooding grounds, as attested by the relatively 

higher abundance of newly-hatched paralarvae.  

The nutritional conditions found by the paralarva are determinant to their survival 

and later recruitment success. The nutritional requirements of the paralarval stages in the 

wild and in captivity have been under discussion for several years and are perceived as the 

bottleneck factor preventing commercial scale aquaculture production of O. vulgaris 

(Iglesias et al., 2007; Seixas, 2009; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004). The identification of the 

preferential preys of O. vulgaris paralarvae in the Ría de Vigo (Roura et al., 2012) open the 

door to a definition of the nutritional profile of the potential preys and O. vulgaris 

paralarval requirements in their natural conditions. Here, for the first time, it was possible 

to identify macro-nutrients and lipid classes including the fatty acid (FA) profile in newly 

hatched and recently-feeding O. vulgaris paralarvae and their natural preys, following the 

changes in the FA trophic markers that occur between preys and paralarval predator. 

Potential prey (specific zooplankton communities) and O. vulgaris paralarval stages 

present an identical Protein:Lipid ratio while small but significant differences in the ratios 

of n-3HUFA/n-6HUFA, DHA/ARA and DHA/EPA and in the ARA content. The results 

obtained here confirm the importance of maintaining the Protein:Lipid ratio between preys 

and paralarvae to guarantee the nutritional requirements of the latter, but at the same time 

maintain high levels of n-3 HUFA that can be used by the paralarva to biosynthesize ARA, 

an essential component to growth. 

Few days after hatching in the Ría de Vigo, the pelagic paralarvae disperse, first 

across-shore and then along-shore by action of the coastal upwelling/downwelling 

mechanism (Moreno et al., 2009; Roura, 2013), and eventually (two to four months later) 

find suitable grounds to settle and grow to maturation. Those grounds are located 

preferentially in the vicinity of estuaries or lagoons systems at short distances from the 



5. General Conclusions 

 

184 

 

coast line (10-15 km) at mean depths of approximately 80 m over grounds with a mixture 

of coarse sand and rocky outcrops that permit adequate sheltering in. Despite the short 

distance between estuarine and lagoon systems where changes in salinity can occur more 

frequently, we found that O. vulgaris juvenlies (sub-adults or pre-recruit) aggregations are 

particularly vulnerable to changes in bottom salinity withstanding salinity variations 

ranging between 35.60 and 36.30 (with a mean optimum salinity of 36.0) (Moreno et al., 

2014). Sea temperature does not play a similarly limiting role, and animals present in 

northwest and south grounds seem to present different optimal sea bottom and surface 

temperatures (Moreno et al., 2014) as would be expected from the different reproductive 

strategies followed on each coasts.  

The environmental characteristics of the southern pre-recruit grounds, and 

particularly the Ría Formosa ground are probably the most persistent in time and the most 

important to support the fisheries exploitation of the entire Portuguese coast and possibly 

the neighbouring communities of the Gulf of Cádiz. Considering the division in 

oceanographic features between the seasonal upwelled northeast coast and the south coast, 

which Cape St. Vincent provides, and the coastal orientation shift from north-south to 

west-east, it is believed that this region acts as barrier to biological exchanges between the 

two adjacent areas (Relvas et al., 2007; Pires et al., 2013). It is therefore most likely that 

the spawning ground identified in the Ría de Vigo and the nurseries found along the 

Portuguese northwestern coast do not support the south coast pre-recruitment grounds and 

the latter is entirely supported by the nurseries identified in the south coast.   

The age structure of an exploited population is seen as a fundamental piece of 

information for the application of traditional assessment models, aiming to achieve the 

sustainable management of a fisheries resource. In the case of O. vulgaris, both the 

application of traditional assessment models and the accurate estimation of age are not 

trivial. Firstly, recruitment success does not depend on the previous spawning-stock 

biomass (due to the absence of generation overlap) but on environmental conditions; and 

secondly research on age and growth for a number of octopods  has shown an incredible 

variability in size between individuals of the same attributed age (e.g. Leporati et al., 2008, 

2007). 

Accurate age and growth estimates will allow adding a time scale to stressful events 

in the life cycle of the animals which potentially increase pressure on the individual, 

affecting population survival and growth rates. Some known stress events can be related to 



5. General Conclusions 

 

185 

 

hatching, settlement and spawning, but potentially others such as fishing patterns and 

varying environmental conditions play crucial roles as well. How these influences the time 

population takes to attain a specified weight or how long the paralarvae from a specific 

seasonal hatchery remain in the pelagic realm or take to settle in pre-recruit grounds are 

important pieces of information to add to our modelling capabilities. The fact that stylets 

register the life of an individual from the very first day, is an advantage of the use of this 

structure to estimate age in relation to the use of beaks. Beaks have been used to estimate 

the age of the O. vulgaris in the Mediterranean (Canali et al., 2011) and in the Sahara bank 

(Perales-Raya et al., 2010), but the estimation of absolute age using these structures is 

difficult due to the erosion on the rostral region from feeding activity.  

We identified and measure the stylets in newly hatched paralarvae for the first time. 

This study also allowed the identification of the hatch check in the stylets of adults on 

which the daily deposition of growth increments (GI) was already validated. Following the 

hatch check, juvenile stylets present a core region where the deposition of GI appears 

irregular or GI are less visible. The core region is limited at its end by the beginning of the 

regular deposition of GI. As no other check or marked transition in the GI deposition 

pattern is identifiable in the stylets, we assume that this core region corresponds to the 

paralarval stage prior to settlement, but recognise that further studies are required in order 

to validate the correspondence between this core region and the paralarval phase.  

Using the stylets of pre-recruits and recruits of the Portuguese Northeast coast we 

investigated the level of precision that this ageing technique allows and made the first 

direct determination of the approximate age of the individuals recruiting to the fishery in 

this area, estimating that it takes approximately eleven months for the animals to attain the 

minimum landing weight of 750 g. 

 

5.1. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 

The growing interest and dependence of the Portuguese fisheries on the commom 

octopus as a guaranteed revenue source, associated to the new demands raised with the 

reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which commits Member-States to assess and 

manage their most important fisheries, thus achieving sustainability by 2020 (EU 

Regulation 1380/2013) has sprouted new interest in research on the species. Additionally, 

the national implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive with the 



5. General Conclusions 

 

186 

 

obligation to achieve Good Environmental Status by 2020 and the use of indicators on 

biodiversity, food web resilience and fisheries sustainability among others, is an additional 

challenge to the management of the marine environment and the maintenance of fisheries 

“health”. 

Achieving sustainable fisheries for O. vulgaris stocks or protecting its best habitat 

are small bricks in the greater framework that ensures GES. However, the characteristics of 

the species and the level of its interactions with prey and predators, including a strongly 

dependent Portuguese fishing community afford it a particular importance. According to 

ICES (2012b), the common octopus stock is identified as a category 4 stock for which only 

reliable catch data are available, implying that a precautionary approach should be 

followed in the advice to future exploitation rates. Due to its life cycle characteristics and 

recruitment dependence of environmental conditions, the future of the stock assessment of 

the species seems to follow the path of the integration of environmental effects in the 

assessment models. This work provided indications of what physical and biological factors 

could have a predominant role in the survival and recruitment success and what 

characteristics identify the essential habitat of juveniles. The next step is to analyse the 

abundance time series (e.g. LPUE, CPUE and survey dedicated abundance estimates) 

comparing those to environmental indicators (e.g. salinity, temperature, fresh water input) 

aiming to identify cause-effect relationships and predict their impacts on stock availability 

to fisheries in the short-term (nine to twelve months predictions to couple with the lifespan 

of the species).  

The coupling of the species life cycle with local environmental conditions, its upper 

predator level in the trophic web and short life span place O. vulgaris (and potentially the 

other cephalopod species) in a good position to be considered a key functional group in the 

definition and monitoring of the marine environmental status in relation to biodiversity, 

fisheries and trophic web descriptors. Associating the biologic monitoring of parameters 

such as the age structure, growth rates and reproductive status of a population under a 

specific environmental condition, with the application of environmental biomarkers, such 

as stable isotope signatures and FA trophic markers, is going to allow the  identification of 

specific environmental conditions or status that  can be useful as tools to monitor 

environmental status and steer towards the GES aimed by the Marine Strategy Framework 

Directive.

Octopus  vulgaris  is an  important  fisheries  resource,  particularly  in  Iberian  waters.  Species  life  cycle  is short
with capacity  to adapt  to  different  environmental  conditions  and,  considered  a  simultaneous  terminal
spawner.  Data  on  maturation  and  other  biological  parameters  collected  from  January  2007  to  November
2010  are  used  to  define  spawning  seasons  for  octopus  landed  by the  small-scale  trap  fisheries  in two
oceanographically  distinct  Portuguese  coastal  areas:  the  northwest  coast  (western  Iberia  upwelling  sys-
tem)  and  the  south  coast  (Gulf  of Cadiz  system).  On a monthly  basis,  we  followed  the  proportion  of
mature  individuals,  and  the  Gonad-Somatic  and  Hayashi  Indices.  Length–weight  relationship,  weight-
at-maturity,  body  condition  and  energy  allocation  were  other  biological  parameters  studied.  Spawning
season  was  markedly  different  in  both  areas.  The  northwest  population  spawns  from  March  to  July,  in
synchrony  with  the  northwest  coast  upwelling  season,  and  the  south  coast  population  spawns  mainly
in summer,  between  August  and  September.  A  less  intense  spawning  peak  in  early  spring  is  present
occasionally  in  the  south  coast.  Weight-at-maturity  is geographically  indistinct,  but  in  both  areas  males
mature  at smaller  sizes  than  females.  Body  condition  increases  significantly  during  maturation  and  mass
allocation  for  reproduction  results  indicate  that  males  and  females  channel  energy  to  reproduction  from
several  sources.

1. Introduction

The common octopus Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier, 1797) is
exploited as a target species by demersal trawl fleets and numer-
ous small-scale fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel
nets operating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie
et al., 2009). In 2010, the Portuguese landings of common octopus in
national ports were 12,602 tons (ten years average landings of 9050
tons). The small-scale fleet, using traps and pots, is responsible for
95% of the common octopus landings (ICES, 2011). Nevertheless,
a growing interest in this species as well as in other commercial
cephalopod species is presently noticed for the bottom trawl fleet,
with 10% of the landings, in 2007 (Fonseca et al., 2008).

Cephalopods are characterized by a plastic life cycle with a rec-
ognized capacity to adapt to different ecosystems, due to a short life
span, high growth rate and diverse diets. O. vulgaris is a merobenthic
incirrate octopod, common in temperate shallow habitats between

the coastline and 200 m depth (Roper et al., 1984; Boletzky, 1992).
Due to its wide distribution, O. vulgaris is one of the best models
to investigate the adaptation of reproductive strategies to specific
environmental features.

The species is characterized by a life span of one year in Saharan
bank waters to two years in Galician waters attaining relatively
large sizes, of up to 6000 g in weight and 25 cm mantle length
(Domain et al., 2000; Otero et al., 2007). It is a simultaneous ter-
minal spawner, laying on average 350,000 eggs in sheltered places
between 20 and 120 m depth (Rocha et al., 2001; Silva et al., 2002).
The spawning season is generally extended throughout the year
with one or two  peaks geographically variable in timing (Hastie
et al., 2009).

The Portuguese coast is a highly dynamic oceanographic region
in the temperate northeast Atlantic, influenced by two impor-
tant oceanographic systems the Western Iberia Upwelling System
(WIUS) and the Gulf of Cadiz System (GCS). The WIUS is character-
ized by a strong influence of the spring-summer coastal upwelling
(Fiúza, 1983; Mason et al., 2005). The predominantly equatorward
winds observed in summer, drive an offshore Ekman transport
and force the upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich, subsurface waters
along the coast (Relvas et al., 2007). The presence of the poleward
current, responsible for the formation of convergence zones over

the shelf-break, has an important ecological role for the retention
and/or poleward transport of the phytoplankton (Ribeiro et al.,
2005) and zooplankton (Santos et al., 2004), with zooplankton
peaking in biomass during late spring and early summer near the
outer-shelf (Cunha, 2001). All year round the coastal sea water tem-
perature ranges between 14.4 ?C and 19.6 ?C (Moreno et al., 2009a)
with a shallow thermocline developing during spring (Cunha,
2001). The south Portuguese coast on the other hand, is influenced
by the GCS. The south coast orientation does not favor upwelling
under northerly winds. Upwelling and downwelling events tend to
be weak and the circulation is mainly wind forced and influenced
by the local orography (García-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007). The Cape
Sta Maria (36? 57?N, 7? 53?W)  divides the continental shelf in two,
supporting different oceanographic processes (García-Lafuente and
Ruiz, 2007). East to the Cape Sta Maria, the presence of the Huelva
front as a warm coastal current flowing along the shore, the signifi-
cant fresh water runoff forming buoyant river plumes in spring, the
occasional occurrence of the Stafford Shear, a cold–warm frontal
region associated to local upwelling systems (Mason et al., 2005)
and an extended Sea Surface Temperature (SST) range, between
the 15.4 ?C and the 21.9 ?C (Moreno et al., 2009b)  are the main
characteristics of the GCS.

Studies on the reproductive features of commercially exploited
marine species such as the common octopus are an important
tool for the assessment of the stock status. Detailed informa-
tion about the timing and the sites of spawning, size at maturity,
and sex ratio at breeding, require a consistent assessment of the
state of sexual maturity. These assessments usually involve sev-
eral aspects of the reproductive development, such as the state
of the gonad and the accessory reproductive structures, and are
based on descriptive maturity scales and/or maturity condition
indices (Boyle and Rodhouse, 2006). Due to the extensive distribu-
tion area of O. vulgaris and the commercial interest of the species in
the Atlantic waters of the Iberian Peninsula, several studies have
been conducted on the reproductive features of geographically
distinct sub-populations. Based in her experiments in captivity
Mangold (1983) reviewed all aspects of the O. vulgaris life cycle,
and more recently other two reviews addressing O. vulgaris were
published (Hastie et al., 2009 and Pierce et al., 2010), compiling
recent advances on fisheries and life cycle aspects.

Regarding specifically O. vulgaris reproductive aspects, several
papers targeting Mediterranean, Iberian and other regional sub-
populations have been published since the late 70s, with diversified
sampling designs and methodology used to identify spawning sea-
son mainly based on proportions of mature individuals and several
condition indices, such as Gonad-Somatic index (GSI) or Hayashi
index (HI). Such studies rely mostly on landings from trawl fleets
(e.g. Quetglas et al., 1998) and small-scale fleets (e.g. Sánchez and
Obarti, 1993; Hernández-García et al., 2002; Fernández-Rueda and
García-Flórez, 2007). A few studies were conducted with sam-
pling designed specifically to O. vulgaris (e.g. Smith and Griffiths,
2002; Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003; Rodríguez-Rua et al., 2005;
Katsanevakis and Verripoulos, 2006).

Considering its regional proximity and the methodology used,
the studies of Silva et al. (2002) and Otero et al. (2007) are par-
ticularly relevant for the present study. In the Northwest Galician
waters, Otero et al. (2007) define a single spawning season during
spring (May–June) related with the seasonal coastal upwelling in
Galician waters, despite the presence of mature females all year
round. In those waters, males mature at smaller sizes than females
and the mass transfer during the maturation process occurs directly
from feeding sources. According to Silva et al.  (2002),  in waters
of the Gulf of Cadiz, the reproductive season covers most of the
year, with two distinct peaks in April/May and August/September.
As in the previous study, males mature at smaller sizes than
females.

The present study aims to identify different reproductive strate-
gies adopted by different populations, considering the distinct
oceanographic features of the northwest coast within the WIUS
and the South coast within the GCS. The reproductive strategies
identified are described in terms of sex ratio, proportion of mature
individuals and monthly mean Gonad-Somatic and Hayashi indices.
At the individual level, length–weight relationships are determined
by sex and area, as well as maturity ogives and the size effect at
maturity. Additionally the effect of size and body condition is ana-
lyzed for each sex in both regions in order to identify sexual and
regional differences regarding the use of storage mass for repro-
duction.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sampling

Samples were collected monthly from January 2007 to
November 2010 from the small-scale trap fishery (Table 1) and
frozen. Sampling sites were chosen considering the two different
oceanographic regions, the Northwest coast, with Peniche as the
landing port, and the South coast with Olhão as the landing port
(Fig. 1). For all individuals, the dorsal mantle length (ML in mm),
individual weight (W in g) and digestive gland weight (DGW in
g) were measured to the nearest 5 mm  and 0.1 g, respectively. To
assess maturation, the following data were collected: testis and
ovary weight (TW and OW), Needham’s complex weight (NCW),
oviduct weight (ODW) and oviducal complex weight (OCW), all
weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. A maturity scale of four stages for
males (I: immature; II: maturing; III: mature; IV: post-spawning)
and five stages for females (I: immature; II: maturing; III: pre-
spawning; IV: mature; V: post-spawning) was used (adapted from
Guerra, 1975).

2.2. Data analysis

2.2.1. Sex ratio and spawning season
Individual weight data aggregated in 200 g weight classes by

study area were analyzed using RMIX, an algorithm designed to
identify and separate normal distributions in size frequency dis-
tributions (Macdonald and Green, 1988; Macdonald, 2010). RMIX
identifies a set of overlapping component distributions that give
the best fit to the histogram. The modal weight classes, identified
by visual inspection of the weight distribution, were used as the
initial weight parameters. Constraints were applied in the analy-
sis, such as a fixed variance coefficient for each component. Only
components with n &gt; 50 were considered and all components were
assumed to be lognormal.

The sex ratio by month was  estimated as the ratio between
males and females. Significant deviations from 1:1 were tested by
a ?2 test with  ? = 0.05. In order to define the spawning season by
study area, the proportion of mature individuals (MI) was deter-
mined monthly as: MIfi = (?Mi/Ni)f, with i as month, and M as the
frequency of mature females, f (maturity stage III and IV) in each
month; MImi = (?Mi/Ni)m, with i as month, and M as the frequency
of mature males, m (maturity stage III) in each month. The spawning
season was  defined empirically as the sampling months in which
MIfi &gt; 0.1 and MImi &gt; 0.1.

Both the Gonad Somatic index (GSI) and the Hayashi index (HI)
are important tools to assess the reproductive and maturation con-
dition both at the individual and population level. The GSI, most
indicated to assess the maturation condition in females (Guerra,
1975), was determined individually for all females in the form
GSI = OW × 100/(BW ? OW)  (Otero et al., 2007). The monthly GSI
was  determined as the monthly mean of the individual GSI and

analyzed separately for each study area. The HI, most indicated to
assess the maturation condition in males (Guerra, 1975) was deter-
mined individually for all males in the form HI = NCW/(NCW + TW)
(Otero et al., 2007). The monthly HI was determined as the monthly
mean of the individual HIm and analyzed separately for each study
area. The standard error was adopted as the measure of variabil-
ity for the determination of the monthly mean of GSI and HI, and
determined as SE =

?
(Var(GSIi)/ni) or SE =

?
(Var(HIi)/ni) with i as

month (Zar, 1999).

2.2.2. Length–weight relationship and weight-at-maturity
The effect of both study area and sex in the length–weight rela-

tionship and maturity proportion was investigated with Scheffé
F-tests at a significance level  ? = 0.05. In order to normalize the
data, ML,  W and MI  by 200 g weight class were log transformed
and compared with a two-way ANOVA test at a significance level

 ? = 0.05.
Length–weight relationships for combined sexes as well as

for all females and all males were determined by means of
non-linear estimates by maximum likelihood of the form log

(W) = a + b × log(ML). Goodness of fit was expressed by r2 and the
significance level of the parameters estimated by Student’s t-test.

A maturity curve, for each sex in each study area, was  fit-
ted to the weight frequency distribution of the proportion (Pi) of
mature individuals by 200 g weight class, with a logistic model:
Pi = 1/(1 + exp(  ? + ?Wi) by weight class, i. Differences in the matu-
rity curves between areas and between sexes were tested by
means of the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test for successive
comparisons. The weight-at-maturity was  defined as the weight
class where 50% of individuals are mature and determined from
W50% = ??/?.

2.2.3. Body condition and energy allocation
The body condition was  determined for each study area for

females and males separately, as the value of the residuals
obtained from the geometric mean regression of log(BW) by
log(BW) ? log(OW) for the females, replacing log(OW) by log(TW)
for the males. The residuals resulting from this analysis allow a
comparison of individuals independently of body weight: positive
residuals indicate animals that are heavier than predicted by the

model, and negative residuals indicate individuals that weight less
than predicted. Variations in body condition were compared by
maturity stage using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s honesty sig-
nificant difference HSD post hoc test (McGrath Steer and Jackson,
2004; Zar, 1999).

To study the relative energy allocation, the variation in weight
between organs in mature animals was assessed. Two  geomet-
ric regressions were performed on mature individuals of each
study area, for each sex separately: (A) the body weight vs. gonad
weight and (B) the body weight vs. digestive gland weight, after log
transformation. The residuals obtained from these two regressions,
provide a size-independent estimate of the relative weight of the
gonads and digestive gland. To determine if there is a mass trans-
fer between organs during the reproductive process, the residuals
derived from both regressions were compared to the body weight
(W), the reproductive complex weight (OW + OCW for females and
TW + NCW for males) and the digestive gland weight using the
Pearson correlation test procedure (Zar, 1999).

3. Results

The weight of females ranged between 625 g (135 mm ML,
maturity stage II, northwest coast) and 6189 g (247 mm  ML,
maturity stage IV, south coast). The weight of males ranged
between 635 g (100 mm ML,  maturity stage II, south coast)
and 5612 g (248 mm ML,  maturity stage III, south coast). The
weight distributions were significantly different between areas
(?2Kruskal–Wallis = 19.62, df = 6, p &amp;lt;0.05) and within each area
between sexes (Northwest coast, ?2Kruskal–Wallis = 28.55, df = 6,
p &amp;lt;0.05; South coast, ?2Kruskal–Wallis = 42.07, df = 6, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 2).
Weight frequency analysis indicates that the weight distribution
was bimodal in both areas. On the Northwest coast the weight
distribution presents two modal peaks in the 1100 g weight class
(modal weight, 1147 g) and in the 2200 g weight class (modal
weight, 2216 g). On the South coast the weight distribution presents
a mode in the 900 g weight class (modal weight of 979 g) and
another in the 1700 g weight class (modal weight of 1724 g)
(Table 2).

3.1. Sex ratio and spawning season

The overall sex ratio (F:M) showed that in the Northwest
coast sample, males are significantly more abundant than females,
0.88:1. In these samples, more males occurred in all months with
the exception of April, October and November when the sex ratio
was  balanced towards females. On the other hand, despite the
fact that the overall sex ratio on the South coast was 1:1, females
were more abundant than males except for the months of August,
October, November and December, where the sex ratio was bal-
anced towards males (Table 3).

Table 4 presents the proportion of mature individuals found
by month in both sampling sites. In the Northwest coast, mature
males were present every month with the exception of November
2007. For females, it is possible to identify a consistent pattern of a
higher proportion of mature individuals (proportion mature &gt; 0.10)
between early spring and late summer. In the south coast, no
mature males were found in the samples in September 2008
and October 2008, between March 2009 and May  2009, and in
September 2010 and November 2010. In this region, there was  a
non-negligible presence of mature females in late winter and ear-
lier spring months of 2007, 2008 and 2010, although the major
proportion of mature females occurs in a single month in summer
or late summer in each year.

Considering the overall results, females in maturity stage I
present a mean GSI of 0.198 (±0.004, SE), in stage II of 0.507
(±0.022), in stage III of 3.947 (±0.215), and for fully mature females
(stage IV) of 9.134 (±0.566), revealing a clear separation between
maturing females and pre-spawning females. In males, the HI
maturity index also presents increasing values from immature to
mature males, with HI values of 0.357 (±0.004) for stage II males,
and 0.429 (±0.005) for stage III males, although in this case with
overlapping extremes. For both maturity stages I and IV, not enough
data were available for the determination of HI by maturity stage
(n = 2 for maturity stage I, and n = 1 for maturity stage IV).

In the northwest coast (Fig. 3) females present higher GSI
between early spring and summer, with two  GSI peaks, during the
studied period. After the second GSI peak, values decrease to near
0.1, comparable to the mean GSI for stage I. Regarding males in the
northwest coast, HI present higher values roughly between late
winter and late summer, comparable to those of stage III males.

In the south coast (Fig. 4), the plot of mean monthly GSI for
females shows that there is a spawning peak in the summer or late
summer months, although in adjacent months values are always
high and near the average for mature animals, indicating the occur-
rence of mature females throughout the year. A secondary peak
occurs in some spring months as is evident in March 2008 and June
to July 2009. As for the HI of males, no specific season stands out
for a higher proportion of mature specimens, although peaks are
found in January 2007, from March 2008 to July 2008, and from
April 2009 to March 2010, indicating that mature males are present
independently of the season.

3.2. Length–weight relationship and weight-at-maturity

Length–weight relationship parameters by area and by sex
as well as the statistical tests to the parameters estimated are
summarized in Table 5. The ANCOVA analysis of the influence of
geographic location and sex in length–weight relationships shows
that the combined effect of both factors is significant (area: sex,
F = 11.83, p-value &amp;lt;0.05), with the effect of the single factor area
also being significant (F = 46.93, p-value &amp;lt;0.05) but not the effect of
the single factor sex (F = 2.47, p-value &gt; 0.05), resulting in different
length–weight relationships in each area, and for males and females
in the northwest coast. In every case the increase in weight with
length may  be characterized as positively allometric (b &gt; 1).

Fig. 5. Mature proportion by weight class and maturity ogives for females and
males. The weight-at-maturity is the weight at which 50% of the individuals in the
population are mature.

Regarding weight-at-maturity, the Kruskal–Wallis one-factor
analysis of variance shows no effect of geographic area of origin
(?2Kruskal–Wallis = 0.20, p &gt; 0.05) but a significant difference between
sexes (?2Kruskal–Wallis = 8.34, p &amp;lt;0.05). Considering each sex sepa-
rately, the effect of geographic area was tested and a no significant
effect of area was shown for both females (?2Kruskal–Wallis = 0.11,
p &gt; 0.05) and males (?2Kruskal–Wallis = 0.003, p &gt; 0.05). Therefore
there are only distinct maturity ogives for males and females with
different values of weight at maturity, 2548.01 g for females and
1577.54 g for males (Fig. 5).

3.3. Body condition and energy allocation

In females, body condition increases significantly between the
early maturation (maturity stage II) and late maturation (maturity
stage III) (?stageII /= ?stageIII, p &amp;lt;0.05). Males also present a consid-
erable increase in body condition between maturity stage II and
stage III (?stageII /= ?stageIII, p &amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 6).

The Pearson correlation index for female energy allocation
shown by the size-independent digestive gland weight, evidences
a negative correlation to individual total weight (?0.109, df = 160,
p &amp;lt;0.05) and to the weight of reproductive structures (?0.226,
df = 160, p &amp;lt;0.05). In the case of males, no significant correlation
was found between the size-independent digestive gland weight
and total weight or reproductive complex weight. Energy alloca-
tion shown by the size-independent gonad weight evidences a
negative correlation with total weight for both females (?0.428,
df = 261, p &amp;lt;0.05) and males (?0.256, df = 492, p &amp;lt;0.05), and sim-
ilarly with the digestive gland weight (females: ?0.256, df = 261,
p &amp;lt;0.05; males: ?0.412, df = 492, p &amp;lt;0.05).

4. Discussion

The definition of different spawning seasons in octopus pop-
ulations within relatively short distances off the Portuguese coast
confirms the plasticity of environmental responses of the O. vulgaris

life cycle, as observed in other cephalopods such as Loligo forbesi and
Loligo vulgaris (Boyle et al., 1995; Moreno et al., 2005). In the north-
west coast, females mature preferentially between early spring and
summer in a long spawning season that encompasses two spawn-
ing peaks, one in February–April and another in June–July. In this
region, mature males are found all year round and are generally
more abundant in the fishery than females, due to the spawn-
ing behavior of the latter, which decreases their availability at
spawning. In autumn, the proportion of immature females in the
population increases with a decrease of mature individuals, both
males and females.

In the south coast, the reproductive season occurs during sum-
mer  peaking in September, despite the non-negligible occurrence
of mature females during late winter or early spring, which would
indicate that more favorable conditions could generate a secondary
peak. Similar situations have been described for other popula-
tions in oligotrophic conditions as in the eastern Mediterranean
waters and south-eastern coast of South Africa (Sánchez and Obarti,
1993; Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003; Katsanevakis and Verripoulos,
2006). Here, the overall sex ratio is balanced towards males, which
seems particularly common in commercially exploited O. vulgaris
populations (Hernández-García et al., 2002; Fernández-Rueda and
García-Flórez, 2007; Otero et al., 2007). This variation in sex ratio,
other than purely derived from the behavioral unavailability of
females to commercial fisheries, has also been explained by a
combination of different factors, such as different growth rates,
migrations, feeding or post-spawning behavior (Mangold, 1983)
although we  have not found any study that indisputably proves the
existence of ontogenic or reproductive migrations in populations
of the common octopus.

Our results seem to indicate that it is mainly the females that
display environmentally adaptive reproductive strategies. In the

Northwest coast where the ocean is more dynamic, the spawn-
ing season is extended over more than 6 months usually with two
reproductive peaks similarly to the results of Hernández-García
et al. (2002) and Fernández-Rueda and García-Flórez (2007) and
Otero et al. (2007).  In this area, the reproductive cycle of O. vulgaris,
therefore appears to be highly connected with the long upwelling
season as in other regions, such as the adjacent Galician waters
and the Sahara Bank (Hatanaka, 1979; Demarcq and Faure, 2000;
Otero et al., 2007), synchronizing hatching with ideal conditions
for food supply (Otero et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 2009a)  combined
with reduced exchanges with offshore areas (Demarcq and Faure,
2000). Ecologically, the WIUS is characterized by a persistent nutri-
ent and zooplankton shoreward transport (Almeida and Queiroga,
2003; Santos et al., 2004; Queiroga et al., 2007), favored by the
westerly winds in late winter and spring, that create a continu-
ous supply of food and potentiate the survival of two  cohorts of
paralarvae, hatching approximately four months apart, in July and
November (Mangold and Boletzky, 1987; Otero et al., 2008; Moreno
et al., 2009b).

In the South coast, where conditions are more stable but less
productive, females concentrate spawning over a shorter period of
time. The factors that trigger the onset of the reproduction seem to
be related with the seasonal occurrence of favorable oceanographic
conditions, such as higher temperatures and salinities, favored by
the easterly winds which are common during summer in the coastal
areas close to Cape Sta Maria (Sánchez and Relvas, 2003; García-
Lafuente et al., 2006). Ecologically, the GCS is a less dynamic and
oligotrophic system, in which species tend to direct all of their
energy onto a single spawning peak, such as in the case of the sar-
dine Sardina pilchardus,  the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and the
wedge sole Dicologlossa cuneata (Baldó et al., 2006). In the case of
the common octopus, individuals spawn in late summer, with the
next generation hatching in winter, when the predominant west-
erly winds favor the transport of nutrients and zooplankton near
to the Cape Sta Maria (García-Lafuente and Ruiz, 2007).

Actually, these differences of timing and spawning strategies
adopted by neighboring O. vulgaris populations is also observed
on the South African coast, where the southwest coast is bathed
by the cold-water northward flowing Benguela Current producing
long and strong upwelling events, and the southeastern coast is
influenced by the Agulhas Current, a western boundary current that
transports warm equatorial water pole wards (Gibbons et al., 2010).
On the west coast, O. vulgaris females spawn throughout the year
but mainly between spring and summer (Smith and Griffiths, 2002),
and in the southeast coast, females spawn in summer, in a shorter
and more intense spawning season (Oosthuizen and Smale, 2003).

The length–weight relationship in the present study varies not
only with sex but also with region, apparently reflecting envi-
ronmental conditions. For the northwest region we determined
different length–weight relationships for females and males, both
positively allometric, but showing that males increase in weight
faster than females (bmales &gt; bfemales). In the south coast, no differ-
ences were found in the length–weight relationship between sexes
and both present lower increases in weight with length than either
sex in the northwest coast.

It is particularly interesting to note that in this study, geographic
area is not reflected in maturity ogives, which may  suggest that
biological constraints could be imposing limits to minimum mat-
uration body size, as occurs in other cephalopod species (see e.g.
Boavida-Portugal et al., 2010; Moreno et al., 2005). The weight-at-
maturity for females is 2550 g and 1577 g for males. The differences
found between sexes are probably linked with the simultaneous
terminal spawning strategy, with females having to store reserves
that are then mobilized to produce yolk, and for behavioral traits
related to egg laying and protection. Additionally males proba-
bly reach maturity earlier in the life cycle, followed by an earlier

decrease in growth rate (Mangold, 1983; Smith et al., 2005). How-
ever, weight-at-maturity registered for both sexes in our samples
is higher than previously published for adjacent waters. In the
northerly neighboring waters of Galicia, females mature at 1788.3 g
and males at 903.4 g (Otero et al., 2007), and in the southeastern
neighboring waters of the Gulf of Cadiz females mature at 2023 g
and males at 671 g (Silva et al., 2002). The differences found in
the weight-at-maturity in different regions may  be related with
the sampling strategy followed by each author, since weight-at-
maturity decreases at peak population maturity (Moreno, 2008)
and thus the proportion of samples taken from peak reproduction
seasons in relation to those obtained throughout the year affects the
size-composition of the sample of mature females. It can also indi-
rectly result from the gears with which the samples were collected,
since some gears are less likely to collect fully mature females
(Fernández-Rueda and García-Flórez, 2007). It is therefore likely
that there is high variability between individuals in any popula-
tion and that sample characteristics, among which size and timing,
may  strongly influence the results. It seems reasonable to assume,
and has been demonstrated, that maturity is first of all driven by a
minimum weight limit and subsequently modulated by biological
and environmental conditions. In our samples, there is a significant
increase in body condition for both females and males between
stage II (immature) and stage III (pre-spawning), indicating that
the relative success of somatic growth in this pre-spawning stage
may  be crucial to determine subsequent events (McGrath Steer and
Jackson, 2004; Otero et al., 2007).

Mass allocation data show that reserves are heading for repro-
duction in both sexes, although some differences can be found
between males and females, in accordance with the studies con-
ducted by Otero et al. (2007) and Rosa et al. (2004),  and similarly to
Loligo forbesi (Collins et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2005). Considering
that males mature at smaller sizes than females, and can maintain
this stage for several months until a female is available to breed,
there seems to be a differentiated breeding strategy between males
and females. Other studies, such as Gonc? alves et al. (2002) and
Rodríguez-Rua et al. (2005),  additionally suggest that mature males
are able to breed with immature females which receive and store
the mature spermatophores inside the oviducal glands until the
oocytes mature. However, only the mass transfer between organs
was  considered here, and this should be complemented by a study
of the types of energetic nutrients that are transferred between
organs.

The present study has shown the potential influence and rel-
ative importance of environmental factors on the reproduction
cycle of O. vulgaris, modulating timing, intensity and synchronism.
Other studies have been constantly disclosing interactions that may
improve our understanding of the main mechanisms. Neverthe-
less, in terms of population segregation, it seems evident that even
under conditions of apparent genetic homogeneity (Cabranes et al.,
2008), populations subjected to fisheries in different geographic
areas must be managed differently. And if we agree on the extent
of its distribution pattern, O. vulgaris is one of the most diversely
impacted cephalopods in terms of environmental exposure.

Abstract This study aims to test whether environ-

mental conditions including the trophic habitat and

diet impact the biochemical composition of storage

organs and affect the nutritional quality of eggs of

Octopus vulgaris. Trophic habitat and gonad quality of

neighbouring populations off the Portuguese coast,

subject to different oceanographic regimes, were

compared using the digestive gland and beaks as

recorders of trophic and habitat preferences, and

gonads as indicators of egg quality. Cholesterol,

phospholipids and triacylglycerol content, essential

fatty acid (EFA) profile of the digestive gland and

stable isotopes, d15N and d13C, in the buccal mass
flesh and beaks were indicators of the differences in

the trophic habitat between populations. For gonad

quality, the same bio-indicators were used to identify

differences with maturation. The study shows that,

although diet influences the EFA profile of the gonads

to a certain degree, the main lipid content, phospho-

lipids and cholesterol content in the gonads are not

influenced by habitat conditions. This, therefore,

suggests that O. vulgaris is able to influence the

quality of egg content independent of diet. The species

is believed to be an income breeder which attains

maturity upon reaching a sufficient condition level,

then channelling energy directly from food to gonad

development.

Introduction

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier (1797),

is an important fisheries resource and a key component

of coastal food webs as a prey and generalist predator

(Smith, 2003; Katsanevakis &amp;amp; Verripoulos, 2004). The

species is believed to channel energy to growth and

reproduction directly from food (Quetglas et al., 2011;

Smith et al., 2011). It is a species with high feeding and

turnover rates (Semmens et al., 2004), short life cycle

and high plasticity to environmental conditions.

Studies on the molecular and nutritional composition

of reserve and reproductive organs reflect the benthic

characteristics of the species. The habitat biodiver-

sity and energy flow to which the populations are

exposed are mirrored in the molecular and energetic

composition of the tissues (Rosa et al., 2004a;

Bandarra et al., 2006; Cherel et al., 2009; Garc??a-

Garrido et al., 2010).

The diet of O. vulgaris depends on the life-cycle

stage, size, depth of occurrence, habitat and seasonal

availability of their prey (Nixon, 1985; Smith, 2003).

The cephalopod hepatopancreas or digestive gland has

different functions in the physiology of Octopus spp.,

including the synthesis and secretion of digestive

enzymes, the reabsorption and metabolism of nutri-

ents; synthesis and storage of lipids like cholesterol,

lipoproteins, glycogen, pigments, vitamins and pro-

tein-bound Fe, Cu, Ca and non-physiological heavy

metals; and excretion and rejection of waste products

of the digestion and cell metabolism (Blanchier &amp;amp;

Boucaud-Camou, 1984; Budelmann et al., 1997;

Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp; Johnston, 2006). Its function as

a storage organ indicates its utility as the ideal source

of dietary tracers such as essential fatty acids (EFA)

(Phillips et al., 2001) and dietary lipids (e.g., triacyl-

glycerol and cholesterol) that are deposited in this

organ with little or no modification of the lipid content

(Boucaud-Camou &amp;amp; Boucher-Rodoni, 1983; Phillips

et al., 2003).

Lipids are important dietary constituents, providing

energy, vitamins and EFA. Cholesterol is the pre-

dominant sterol in the cephalopod’s lipid reserves

(Sieiro et al., 2006) and proxy of the production of

hormones in marine invertebrates (Kanazawa, 2002).

The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol seems to be

absent in cephalopods, suggesting that it is an

essential dietary nutrient (Villanueva &amp;amp; Norman,

2008). Triacylglycerol is a neutral lipid involved in

fatty acid (FA) storage and metabolism (Lee et al.,

2006). The FAs incorporated within the phospholipids

act as building blocks for the membrane lipid bilayer

(Dalsgaard et al., 2003; Berge? &amp;amp; Barnathan, 2005;

Athenstaedt &amp;amp; Daum, 2006). The seasonal variability

of triacylglycerols and phospholipids is related with

cellular mechanisms under different environmental

conditions and because of that, they are good indica-

tors of the condition (Shulman &amp;amp; Love, 2006). The

most important EFA are arachidonic acid C20:4n6

(ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5n3 (EPA) and

docosahexaenoic acid C22:6n3 (DHA). The require-

ments on ARA, EPA and DHA and the balance

between them are important for growth (Navarro &amp;amp;

Villanueva, 2000; Shulman &amp;amp; Love, 2006). These

EFA are related with the energy channelling, the

cellular membrane structure and function, and are

integral elements of phospholipids as components of

lipid bilayers (Tocher, 2010).

Reproduction timing in O. vulgaris depends on the

local oceanographic regime: a long season in produc-

tive systems, frequently with two reproductive peaks;

and a shorter season (1–2 months) in oligotrophic

systems (Lourenc?o et al., 2012). The formation of the

yolk is extremely important during maturation and egg

development, because the newly hatched paralarvae

are not truly lecithotrophic depending to some extent

on these reserves to survive (Boletzky, 1975; Villanu-

eva &amp;amp; Norman, 2008). The nutritional content of the

yolk is mainly protein, but lipids are also important for

membrane formation and energetic supply (11–14% of

dry weight) particularly that of polyunsaturated fatty

acids (PUFA), phospholipids and cholesterol (Navarro

&amp;amp; Villanueva, 2000).

The d13C and d15N signatures in different tissues of
a predator like O. vulgaris reflect its habitat and

trophic position, respectively (Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson,

2005). Consumers or predators are enriched in
15

N

relative to their food and consequently the d15N
measurement is an indicator of the consumer trophic

position (Vander Zanden &amp;amp; Rasmussen, 2001; Hobson

&amp;amp; Cherel, 2006). With little variation along the food

chain, the d13C is used to determine primary sources in
the trophic web indicating the habitat of the organism,

and the inshore versus offshore, or pelagic versus

benthic contribution of food intake (Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson,

2007; Jackson et al., 2007). The determination of

stable isotope d13C and d15N signatures both in muscle
and in cephalopod beaks are complementary

approaches to stomach content and fatty acid analysis

in studies of trophic dynamics and feeding ecology,

allowing the identification of ontogenic migration and

feeding shift events (Stowasser, 2004; Jackson et al.,

2007). In species like O. vulgaris, diet studies are

difficult to carry out due to the diversity of preys

(Smith, 2003); the fast digestion rate (Boucaud-

Camou &amp;amp; Boucher-Rodoni, 1983); and the large

number of empty stomachs. For these cases, an

analytic approach combining fatty acids and stable

Hydrobiologia

123



isotopes analyses provides overall information on the

average diet regarding both trophic level and habitat of

a particular population.

Here we hypothesise that environmental condi-

tions, including the trophic habitat, influence the

biochemical composition of storage organs and the

nutritional quality of the eggs (indirectly potentially

affecting the next generation). The Portuguese coast

presents an advantageous geographical setting where

it is possible to follow O. vulgaris populations which

are subjected to distinct environmental conditions: in

the northwest coast, one of the populations is in a

productive system integrated in the Western Iberia

Upwelling System (Relvas et al., 2007); in the south,

the other is integrated in the Gulf of Cadiz System

influenced by the oligotrophic and warmer waters of

the Huelva front where downwelling and upwelling

events are weaker and not seasonal (Garc??a-Lafuente

et al., 2006). To test our hypothesis, we followed the

EFA profile and the content of total lipids, cholesterol,

triacylglycerol and phospholipids as bio-indicators of

variations in the digestive gland and in immature and

fully developed gonads of females of both popula-

tions. We also followed the stable isotope d13C and
d15N signatures in the upper and lower beaks and
buccal mass tissue of immature and mature individuals

to identify the possible differences in the overall diet

between population and maturity stages.

Materials and methods

Sampling

All tissue samples were obtained from females

captured in the small-scale O. vulgaris fisheries from

March to April 2011 within the two study areas

represented by landings in ports of Peniche (northwest

coast area; lat: 39?21.40 N, long: 9?20.38 W) and
Olha?o (south coast area; lat: 36?59.34 N, long:
7?50.44 W). Within each area, five immature females
and five mature females were selected and digestive

gland tissue and gonads were collected, freeze-dried

and stored at -20?C.
Cleaned upper and lower beaks and buccal mass

muscular tissue (referred as flesh hereafter) samples

were collected from frozen animals and kept in 70%

ethanol for isotopic analysis. Sampling was conducted

considering the same explanatory factors, area and

maturity in an unbalanced sampling design, collecting

27 flesh samples (4 mature and 6 immature samples in

the northwest coast and 5 mature and 12 immature

samples in the south coast) and 33 beak samples

(8 mature and 9 immature in the northwest coast and 5

mature and 12 immature in the south coast). The dorsal

mantle length and individual weight were measured to

the nearest 5 mm and 0.1 g, respectively. Immature

and maturing females were classified as immature

whereas mature and spawning females were classified

as mature (according to Guerra, 1975).

Stable isotope analyses

Beaks and flesh samples were freeze-dried and

homogenized prior to analysis. To avoid the depletion

of d13C values due to the presence of lipids, flesh
samples were rinsed successively in a 2:1 chloroform–

methanol solution (Cherel et al., 2005). Nitrogen and

carbon isotope ratios were determined via Finningan

conflo II interface to a Thermo Delta V S mass

spectrometer coupled to a Flash EA1112 Series

elemental analyser. Approximately 0.3 mg of each

sample was combusted in a tin cup for the simulta-

neous determination of nitrogen and carbon isotope

ratios. Isotope ratios are presented in the usual d
notation relative to the PeeDee Belemnite (PDB) for

carbon and atmospheric N2 (AIR) for nitrogen, and

expressed as %. Replicate measurements of internal
laboratory standards (acetanilide) indicate a precision

of\0.2% both for d13C and d15N. The C/N mass ratio
was used to check the effectiveness of the lipid

extraction in the flesh and in the beaks (Post et al.,

2007; Cherel et al., 2009).

Prior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of

normality and sample variance homogeneity were

assessed by Shapiro–Wilk’s test and Bartlett’s test,

respectively. A paired t test was performed to assess

possible differences in stable isotope signatures

between upper and lower beaks. A two-way analysis

of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the

effect of area, maturity and the interaction between the

two factors in the ratios d13C and d15N in the upper and
lower beaks and flesh. The hypothesis for the two-way

ANOVA was formulated under the assumption of:

H0A: there is no main effect of the factor area on the

stable isotope (d13C or d15N) mean value in the beaks
upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0B: there is no main

effect of the factor maturity on the stable isotope mean

value in the upper and lower beaks and flesh; H0C: there

is no additive effect of the interaction between area and

maturity on the stable isotope mean value in the upper

and lower beaks and flesh. If H0C was rejected, a post-

hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons was per-

formed to determine which combination of factors

were significantly different (P value \ 0.05).

Lipid class analyses

The total lipid (TL) fraction was extracted by the Bligh

&amp;amp; Dyer (1959) method. Samples of &amp;amp;1 and &amp;amp;2 g of
dry tissue of digestive glands and gonads were used,

respectively. The results were expressed as g lipid/

100 g dry weight. Lipid classes were determined by

different spectrophotometric methods. The phospho-

lipids fraction was purified from the total lipid extract

according to Auborg et al. (1996). Total phospholipids

were quantified by measuring the organic phosphorus

in total lipid extracts according to the Raheja et al.

(1973) method based on a complex formation with

ammonium molybdate. Results are expressed as

g PL/100 g dry weight. Total cholesterol was deter-

mined in the total lipids extracts by the method of

Huang et al. (1961) based on the Liebermann–Buchardt

reaction. Results are expressed in g cholesterol/100 g

dry weight. FA composition of lipids present in the

Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer extract was determined by converting

total lipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME),

according to the method described by Lepage &amp;amp; Roy

(1984). FAME were analysed by gas chromatography.

Peaks corresponding to FAs were identified by com-

parison of their retention times with standard mixtures.

Peak areas were automatically integrated with C19:0

being used as an internal standard for quantitative

analysis. The concentration of each fatty acid or fatty

acid group was expressed as g/100 g total FAME.

Prior to the statistical analysis, the assumptions of

normality and sample variance homogeneity were

assessed with Shapiro–Wilk’s and Bartlett’s tests,

respectively. Whenever these assumptions failed the

data were log-transformed to guarantee normality and

variance homogeneity. Two-way ANOVA was per-

formed to assess the effect of area, maturity and the

interaction between the two factors in the lipid classes

in the digestive gland and in the gonad. The hypothesis

for the two-way ANOVA was formulated under the

assumption of: H0A: there is no main effect of the

factor area on the lipid class content in the tissue; H0B:

there is no main effect of the factor maturity on the

lipid class content in the tissue; H0C: there is no

additive effect of the interaction between area and

maturity on the mean lipid class content in the tissue. If

H0C was rejected, a post hoc Tukey test for multiple

comparisons was performed to determine which factor

combinations were significantly different.

Major FAs were defined as those presenting

concentration by area and by maturity stage higher

than 1 g/100 g of FAME. For each FA, the assumption

of sample normality and homogeneity was tested by

the Shapiro–Wilk’s and Bartlett’s, respectively, by

tissue and factor (area and maturity), when these

assumptions failed, the variable was log-transformed.

Differences in mean concentration of each FA

between area and maturity stage were tested with

t test (Zar, 1999). The major fatty acids profile was

compared by explanatory factor, area and maturity and

the interaction between area and maturity by means of

Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA), followed by Dis-

criminant Function Analysis (DFA). The MANOVA

and DFA are complementary approaches based in the

separation of observation groups represented by their

centroids obtained under the effect of two or more

factors levels (Quinn &amp;amp; Keough, 2002). DFA is

particularly useful to detect the variables that better

discriminates between different observation groups

(Zuur et al., 2007).

Results

Diet and habitat

According to the mean C:N mass ratio, lipids were

effectively removed from flesh (C:N = 3.13 ± 0.06,

mean ± standard deviation, SD) and from beaks

(upper beak: 3.38 ± 0.07; lower beak: 3.33 ± 0.08).

The flesh of O. vulgaris females presents a mean d15N
of 11.86 ± 0.66 (SD) %, and the mean d13C value of
-16.77 ± 0.74 (SD) % (Fig. 1) independently of
area, maturity stage or the interaction of both factors

(Table 1). Upper and lower beaks present different

d15N and d13C signatures between them (for d15N:
paired t = -2.12; df = 32, P value \ 0.01; for d13C:
paired t = -4.14, df = 32, P value \ 0.01). The
factorial ANOVA shows that area has a significant

effect in d15N signature (Table 1), with both beaks
presenting higher values in south coast (Fig. 1). The

d13C signature is not affected by area in both beaks
(Table 1).

The mean individual weight of the females col-

lected was 2340.30 ± 979.45 (SD) g in the northwest

coast and 2637.40 ± 479.00 (SD) g in the south coast.

Digestive gland and gonad presented different mean

contents in total lipids and lipid classes, with the

digestive gland presenting higher mean content of

total lipids, cholesterol and triacylglycerol (Fig. 2).

Despite that, the gonads were richer in phospholipids

than the digestive gland (Fig. 2).

In the digestive gland the mean total lipid content

and mean cholesterol content depended on area. The

digestive glands collected in the northwest coast

presented a significantly lower content of total lipids

(t = -2.42, df = 18, P value \ 0.01), and higher
mean content in cholesterol (t = 7.91, df = 18,

P value \ 0.01; see Fig. 2) when compared with
south coast. The two-way ANOVA for the interaction

between the factors area and maturity showed signif-

icant differences in the mean content of cholesterol

and triacylglycerol due to the additive effect of the two

factors (Table 1).

In the digestive gland, the fatty acids (FA) repre-

sented 31 and 46 lg/mg of the total lipid content in the
northwest coast and the south coast, respectively. The

most abundant FA were the saturated fatty acids

(SFA), followed by the polyunsaturated fatty acids

(PUFA) and the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)

(Table 2). The mean content of myristic acid, C14:0;

palmitoleic acid, C16:1n7; gondoic acid, C20:1n9;

ARA, C20:4n6 and DHA were significantly different

between areas, as well as the ratio DHA/EPA mainly

due to the increase in DHA content in digestive glands

of the south coast (Table 2). Results of the MANOVA

analysis showed that content levels depend both on

area and maturity, with no effect on the interaction

between both factors (Table 3). In the DFA, the first

discriminant function maximizes the differences

between groups. The DFA for region groups show

that the first function explained 84% of the variability,

with a good separation between the northwest coast

group (class score = 0.92) and the south coast group

(class score = -0.92). The FA that contributed the

most to the group separation was the DHA which was

positively correlated with the south coast and nega-

tively correlated with northwest coast. The DFA for

maturity groups showed a good separation between

immature (class score = -0.85) and mature digestive

glands (class score = 1.02) with 86% of explained

variation. The FAs that most contributed to the group

separation were EPA and DHA and C18:0. The DFA

for area x maturity groups (Fig. 3, digestive gland)

showed a poor separation between groups with an

explained variance of 51% in accordance with MA-

NOVA results. Nevertheless, the FAs that contributed

the most to the group separation were: DHA, posi-

tively related with immature females of the south coast

area and negatively related with the immature and

mature females from northwest coast: EPA, positively

related with the immature females, and negatively

related with the northwest coast mature females.

Maturity

Stable isotope signatures showed that the d13C signa-
ture is statistically significant different with the

maturity stage (Table 1), with the beaks of immature

females presenting significant higher d13C signature
(Fig. 1).

The effect of different nutritional levels on maturity

was studied by assessing differences in the digestive

gland and gonads with maturity. For the digestive

gland, there was no effect of this factor in the lipid

classes content studied (Table 1). Total lipid, choles-

terol and triacylglycerol contents tended to increase

from immature to mature females although this

increase is not statistically significant. In relation to

the phospholipid content, the digestive glands of

mature females of south coast were significantly poor

in phospholipids in relation to the immature ones

(t = 3.50, df = 18, P value \ 0.01) (Fig. 2). Never-
theless, when comparing the digestive glands lipid

content between mature females of northern coast with

mature females of south coast, some differences arose.

Particularly, the total lipid content (t = -2.82,

df = 18, P value = 0.01), the cholesterol content

(t = 10.52, df = 18, P value \ 0.01) and the phos-
pholipids content (t = 6.04, df = 18, P value \ 0.01)
were significantly higher in the mature digestive

glands of south coast (Fig. 2).

Mature gonads of the northwest coast present

higher contents in triacylglycerol, cholesterol and

phospholipids, although no significant differences

were found for the mean content of those bio-

indicators between immature and mature individuals

(Fig. 2; Table 1). In the south coast, the gonads of

mature individuals are significantly higher than

immature individuals in triacylglycerol (t = -2.86,

df = 18, P value \ 0.01) and phospholipids (t =
3.50, df = 18, P value \ 0.01).

The FA profile in the gonads was affected by area,

maturity, and by the interaction of both factors

(Table 3). Mature gonads were rich in SFA, showing

the capacity to produce saturated fatty acids namely

palmitic acid C16:0, increasing significantly from

immature to mature females in the northwest coast. In

opposition, the stearic acid C18:0 in the northwest

coast decreased from immature to mature gonads

(Table 2). MUFA were the second most abundant

fatty acids in the gonads, with the presence of

vaccenic acid C18:1n7 as a minor FA, presenting

significant differences between the northwest coast

and the south coast namely in the FA C17:1 and

C20:1n9. The FA C16:1n7 was significantly more

abundant in immature than in mature gonads from the

northwest coast. The PUFA represented between 9

and 13% of the FAME present in the total lipid

content of the gonads, with the content in ARA, DHA

and EPA decreasing significantly from immature to

mature gonads in both study areas. In particular, the

significant decrease in DHA in the northwest coast led

to significant differences between the DHA/EPA ratio

of immature and mature females in that area

(Table 1).

The DFA on the FA profile of the females’ gonads

between areas showed that the first function explained

79% of the variability, with a good separation between

the northwest coast group (class score = 0.82) and the

south coast group (class score = -0.97). The FA that

contributed the most to the group separation is the

C18:0 which is positively correlated with the north-

west coast. The DFA for maturity groups showed a

good separation between immature (class score =

-0.94) and mature individuals (class score = 0.79)

with 74% of the variability explained. The FA that

contributed the most to the group separation was the

C18:0, positively correlated to the immature individ-

uals. The DFA for area x maturity groups (Fig. 3,

Gonad) showed a good separation between groups

with an explained variability of 95% in concordance

with MANOVA results. The FAs that contributed the

most to the group separation were C16:0, 18:0 and

ARA that were positively correlated with immature

gonads from both areas.

Discussion

The d15N and d13C signatures in the flesh seem to be
adequate short-term indicators of diet and habitat.

Cherel &amp;amp; Hobson (2005), working on Psychroteuthis

glacialis, suggested that the difference between the

d15N of the flesh relative to the beaks relates to
the chitin synthesis and consequent N accretion in

the beaks. In the more recently formed regions of the

beaks, such as the wing, the d13C signature of the
predator closely matches that of the prey (Hobson &amp;amp;

Cherel, 2006), also reflecting to an extent the recent

dietary composition. The d15N and d13C of beaks are,
therefore, used as indicators of habitat and diet

preference (Post, 2002; Jackson et al., 2007). In our

southern population of O. vulgaris, beak d13C signa-
ture is different between maturity stages, probably a

reflection of the recent trophic history of the different

maturation stages. The higher d15N ratio in the beaks
from the south coast in relation to the northwest coast

is probably related to the higher frequency of occur-

rence of crustacean prey (e.g., decapod crabs) found in

the diet of O. vulgaris sampled (Lourenc?o, unpub-

lished data). Rosa et al. (2004b) show that the decapod

crabs are important prey of the O. vulgaris populations

along the Portuguese coast and the presence of

crustacean prey in the diet of Loligo forbesi is known

to increase the d15N content of the beaks and flesh of
that species (Stowasser, 2004). Darnaude et al. (2004)

relate increased d15N to a significant input from river
plumes, through the added input of d15N-rich partic-
ulate organic matter. This, however, does not appear to

be the case of our study, since river input is more

important on the west than on the south coast.

Considering that the digestive gland is mainly a

lipid reservoir and, therefore, has a high lipid content,

it is the ideal organ to trace fatty acids as diet bio-

indicators (Phillips et al., 2001; Moltschaniwskyj &amp;amp;

Johnston, 2006; Garc??a-Garrido et al., 2010). In our

study the total lipid content ranged between 14.60% in

northwest coast immature females, in line with values

obtained by Rosa et al. (2004a), and 24.42% in south

coast mature females. Contrary to what might be

expected for a nutrient-rich area, the digestive glands

of the northwest coast population present relatively

low lipid content in comparison to the south coast

population, in particular to the storage lipid triacyl-

glycerol. This is probably related to nutrient season-

ality. In March and April the pre-upwelling conditions

in the northeast coast determine a low-fat content in

sardine Sardina pilchardus (Bandarra et al., 2006) and

horse-mackerel Trachurus trachurus (Bandarra et al.,

2001), while on the other hand phytoplankton peaks in

the south coast are common in early spring associated

with the warmer and nitrogen-rich river plumes.

Conditions in the south are then relatively favourable

to the development of earlier phytoplankton blooms

dominated by dinoflagellates (Navarro &amp;amp; Ruiz, 2006;

Crespo et al., 2012), which is corroborated by the

higher relative content in ARA, EPA and DHA

produced by the community of primary producers

(Dalsgaard et al., 2003).

The high digestive gland content of C18:1n9

(&amp;amp;11% in both study areas), which is indicative of
deep waters prey species, and C16:0 (&amp;amp;20% in both
study areas) which is indicative of the presence of

herbivorous preys, actually suggest a diverse diet

(Piche? et al., 2010). Comparing both areas, the DHA/

EPA ratio is exceptionally low in the north-western

population. According to Dalsgaard et al. (2003), the

DHA content should be higher relative to the EPA for

a carnivorous species. In their study Rosa et al.

(2004b) observed the possibility of a carnivorous

preys on the northwest coast, while this study high-

lights a dominance of a carnivorous preys towards the

south coast. A higher triacylglycerol content in the

Hydrobiologia

123



South can in addition be related with the dominance of

crustacean preys (Phillips et al., 2003) in the diet of the

population of this area, which is also suggested by the

d15N and d13C of the beaks.
It is, therefore, likely that during the period in

analysis the diet of the south coast population had a

relatively higher dominance of crustacean prey, those

in turn recently fed on lipid-rich plankton.

As in the squids Sepioteuthis lessoniana and

Photololigo sp. (Semmens, 1998), or the cuttlefish

Sepia officinalis (Blanchier &amp;amp; Boucaud-Camou,

1984), the lipid class contents in the digestive gland

do not correlate directly with the lipid contents of the

oocytes in the gonad, especially for total lipid content,

triacylglycerol and phospholipids (see Fig. 2). The

lipid class contents of the digestive gland of mature

females show significant differences between regions

but this regional difference is not found in the gonads

of the same females, which seems to indicate that the

factors triggering oocytes maturity are independent of

the nutritional value of reserves, even though females

generally reach maturity beyond the optimum body

mass and independently of gonad size (Lourenc?o et al.,

2012). As income breeders that channel the energy

directly from food to the gonad during maturation

(Houston et al., 2006; Quetglas et al., 2011), the

different levels in triacylglycerol and cholesterol

noted in the O. vulgaris digestive glands between

geographical areas should be expected to show in the

gonads as a reflection of diet. Despite that, only the

gonad fatty acid profile presents significant differences

related with both area and maturity stage evidencing

not only that the composition changes as maturation

progresses but also that there are differences between

areas at every stage of the process. The gonads of the

south coast are richer in PUFA and in MUFA and the

gonads of the northwest coast are richer in SFA

especially C16:0 and C18:0. Nevertheless, the differ-

ences found in the ratio DHA/EPA between areas are

marginally insignificant (t = -1.86, df = 18,

P value = 0.08), indicating a low impact of trophic

habitat in the quality of oocytes. These results partially

aggree with the results obtained by Far??as et al. (2011).

In that study, the authors found a direct effect of diet in

the DHA/EPA ratio for Patagonian red octopus

Enteroctopus megalocyathus; here, although FA pro-

file in the gonads revealed different between areas, the

contents in DHA, EPA or DHA/EPA ratio are identical

between the studied areas.

In conclusion, this study shows that, despite the

variability observed in the stable isotopic signatures

studied, d15N signature in beaks is a valuable bio-
indicator to follow the diet history of different O.

vulgaris populations, and the d13C signature has
potential to assess feeding behaviour changes related

with maturity in O. vulgaris females. Furthermore,

specific lipid classes as the triacylglycerol and the

cholesterol and its content in the digestive gland can

be used as indicators of their nutritional availability in

the local habitat. The fatty acid profile is a good

indicator of both nutritional availability in the envi-

ronment and also of gonads quality as shown by the

main EFA content and the EPA/DHA ratio. The

environmental availability of these EFA depends on

seasonal cycles. Upwelling/downwelling events for

example determine changes in the lipidic contents of

the plankton and in turn of the prey of octopus, as

evidenced by the higher total lipids and cholesterol

content in the digestive glands of the animals from the

south coast. In spite of their characteristics as income

breeders, it is difficult to observe a direct relationship

between the lipid class contents in the digestive gland

and in the gonad, suggesting that a measure of

regulation is exerted between food intake and oocyte

formation.

The  exploitation  of  the  common  octopus  Octopus  vulgaris  in  Portugal  increased  50%  in  the  last  20 years,
largely  motivated  by  the  depletion  of  many  fish  stocks.  Recently,  the  biomass  of  this  fishery  resource
sharply  decreased  in  some  areas  causing  serious  concern  among  local  fishermen  and  an  effort  is under-
way  to  advise  on  novel  and sustainable  management  measures.  In  this  context,  the  octopus  pre-recruit
aggregations  along  the  Portuguese  coast  are  identified  using  georeferenced  fishery-independent  data,
from  autumn  and  winter  sampling  between  1996  and  2008.  The  relationships  between  pre-recruit  aggre-
gations  and  several  environmental  variables  are  analyzed  to  characterize  their  essential  habitats  (EFH).
Pre-recruits  are  distributed  throughout  the  Portuguese  coast  aggregated  in  8  distinct  recruitment  grounds
located on the  middle-shelf  at 11–19  km  from  the  coastline,  which  are  characterized  by  average  bottom
depths of  65–110  m  and  are  associated  to major  rivers  and  lagoon  systems.  Within  each  season  pre-
recruit  abundance  is much  higher  in  the  south  region,  while  pre-recruit  aggregations  on  the  northwest
coast  showed  high  inter-annual  and seasonal  variation  driven  by  environmental  variability.  The  western
zone adjacent  to  Ria  Formosa  lagoon  (southern  coast)  was  identified  as  the  main  recruitment  ground  for
O.  vulgaris  along  the  Portuguese  coast.  This  is  supported  by  the  higher  abundance  of  pre-recruits  and  by
the recurrence  of  their  presence  in  this  area  over  the  years  analyzed,  both  in autumn  and  winter.  The
effects of physical  variables  on  pre-recruit  abundance  modelled  with  generalized  additive  models  (GAM)
showed  important  regional  differences.  Bottom  salinity  and river  runoff  are  the  environmental  variables
that have  most  impact  on  pre-recruit  distribution  and  abundance  on  the  west  coast,  regardless  of  any
seasonal  effects.  On  the  other  hand,  temperature  imposes  distinct  seasonal  and  regional  limitations  on

pre-recruit  distribution,  both  on  the  NW  and  S  regions.  Pre-recruit  preferential  habitat  is characterized
by  bottom  temperatures  of 14 ?C,  salinity  values  around  36.0,  low  precipitation  (average &amp;lt;200  mm),  and
coarse  sediments  (in  which  they  find  shelters  to escape  predation).  Some  of the  octopus  recruitment
grounds  identified  are  located  in  areas  under  intense  fishing  pressure,  both  by  artisanal  fisheries  using
traps and  by bottom  trawling.  Thus,  their  value  for the  sustainability  of  the  octopus  fishery  should  be

in fut
taken  into  consideration  

. Introduction

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier 1797, is one of
he most commercially important cephalopods worldwide. It is

xploited as a target species by demersal trawl fleets and sev-
ral local fisheries, using hand jigs, pots, traps and trammel nets
perating in southern Europe and northwestern Africa (Hastie et al.,

2009). In Portugal it is also one of the most important fisheries
resources, often the most important species in first sale value,
with average landings of 8500 tonnes per year (1986–2011). It is
captured mainly with traps (?90%), thus having a major impor-
tance in the Portuguese artisanal fishery, especially in the south
region (Algarve), where it accounts for more than 20% of the fish-
ing activity income (DGRM, 2012). The exploitation of octopus in

Portugal increased 50% in the last 20 years, largely motivated by
the depletion of many finfish stocks. Recently, the landed biomass
of this fishery resource has sharply decreased in some areas
causing serious concern among local fishermen and an effort is

nderway by scientists to advise on novel and sustainable man-
gement measures.

O. vulgaris has a short life cycle of 12–18 months (Iglesias et al.,
004; Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2006). The spawning sea-
on extends, in general, throughout the year (Hastie et al., 2009).
ver the NW Portuguese shelf spawning occurs in two  main peaks

April and August) and on the south shelf a single peak is generally
etected in summer (Lourenc? o et al., 2012). Paralarvae are plank-
onic and settle in the benthic habitat of adults at ca 173 mg  total
eight (Mangold, 1983; Villanueva, 1995). After settlement ani-
als grow fast at ca. 1.2–1.6% d?1, reaching the fisheries minimum

anding weight (750 g) at 9–10 months old (Domain et al., 2000;
atsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2006). O. vulgaris is mainly a coastal
pecies (0–100 m depth) with a wide geographic distribution. Den-
ity is low between 100 and 200 m and only few specimens have
een found beyond the continental shelf break (Belcari and Sartor,
999; Quetglas et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002; Garofalo et al., 2010).
ub-adults and spawners generally have a distinct depth range dis-
ribution (Sánchez and Obarti, 1993; Hernández-Garcia et al., 1997;
araj and Bez, 2007). Of the environmental variables that may  affect
he spatial distribution and abundance of sub-adults, seawater tem-
erature is thought to be the most important one (Garofalo et al.,
010).

Habitat modelling for marine animals is increasingly used
s a management tool, to support conservation and sustainable
xploitation. “Essential Fish Habitat” (EFH) is the habitat identified
s essential to the ecological and biological requirements for critical
ife history stages of exploited species, and which may  require spe-
ial protection to improve stock status and long term sustainability
e.g. Ardizzone, 2006; Valavanis and Smith, 2007). EFH may  be mod-
lled based on the abundance of animals at specific life cycle stages
e.g. sub-adults) and the habitat identified as the aggregation of
biotic and biotic parameters where individuals of that specific life
ycle stage are concentrated (e.g. recruitment grounds). Successful
odelling depends on knowledge of species biology and ecology,

hus permitting selection of appropriate variables, measured at an
ppropriate scale (see Valavanis et al., 2008).

The O. vulgaris life cycle characteristics increase resilience of this
pecies to high fishing pressure. At the same time O. vulgaris popu-
ations are vulnerable to overfishing because of non-overlapping
enerations (Boyle and Rodhouse, 2005), and the sub-adult phase
the pre-recruits) is therefore a key life stage on which we may
oncentrate fishery management to ensure sustainability of this
eavily exploited species. The present study aims to, firstly identify
reas along the Portuguese coast where pre-recruits of O. vulgaris
ggregate, using georeferenced fishery-independent data, that may
e protected in future management options; and secondly, to ana-

yze the relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several
biotic environmental variables to delineate their optimum habitat.

. Materials and methods

.1. Survey sampling

Two sets of bottom trawl surveys carried out on the Portuguese
ontinental coast onboard R/V Noruega and R/V Capricórnio were
elected for the analysis of O. vulgaris pre-recruit aggregations, the
utumn and winter surveys. The main objective of these research
urveys is to estimate indices of abundance and biomass of the most
ommercially important fish and crustacean species. For our study
e selected only the surveys which used a bottom trawling net suit-

ble to sample benthic species, the “FGAV019”, with a cod end of

0 mm mesh size, a mean vertical opening of 2.5 m and a mean
orizontal opening between wings of 25 m.  The sampling area
overed latitudes 36.7? to 41.8? N and longitudes 7.47? to 10.0? W
n the NE Atlantic. Both datasets were obtained following a similar

depth-stratified sampling design, with ca. 70–80 hauls distributed
along the Portuguese continental shelf and slope (Fig. 1). The tow
duration varied between 20 and 60 min, but no significant differ-
ences were previously found in the mean abundance and length
distribution for several species due to different tow duration (Car-
dador, com. pers.). The number of hauls by research cruise and other
characteristics of the sampling procedure are detailed in Table 1. In
each sampling station, all of the O. vulgaris captured were weighted
(individual body weight, to the nearest g) and measured (mantle
length, to the nearest 0.5 mm).

2.2. Environmental data

The following environmental variables were selected and
assigned to each sampling station. Satellite-derived sea surface
temperature data (SST) were obtained for each sampling station
from the AVHRR Pathfinder V.5 provided by NASA-JPL-Physical
Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). Sea
bottom temperature (SBT), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea bot-
tom salinity (SBS) were extracted from CTD temperature profiles
undertaken during the survey cruises at the end of the fishing sta-
tions. CTD data were not available for a few stations and for the
winter 2005 cruise. SBT data to fill in these gaps were obtained
from CTD casts extracted from NODC and ICES databases. Bottom
sediment type (BS) in each sampling station was classified based
on the fishery charts from the Instituto Hidrográfico as gravel (gv),
coarse sand (cs), sand (s), mud  (md) and rocky mud  (rm). River

runoff (RR) from the main rivers and rainfall (RA) were extracted
from the Sistema Nacional de Informac? ão de Recursos Hídricos
(http://snirh.pt).

.3. Data analysis

Octopus with body weight below the fisheries minimum landing
eight (750 g) captured during the survey cruises listed in Table 1,
ere classified as pre-recruits and their distribution and abundance
sed to identify O. vulgaris recruitment grounds. Catches were con-
erted into an abundance index as number of pre-recruits per hour
rawling.

The spatial distribution of pre-recruits was analyzed and
apped with the geostatistical interpolation method, Krigging

Cressie, 1991), implemented in the software SURFER 9.0. Pre-
ecruit abundance (PR) data were interpolated separately by
rigging, using a linear variogram with no nugget effect, for each
ruise and also averaged for autumn and winter cruises. Distinct
ecruitment grounds were identified as those areas centred at
re-recruit distribution centroids with a mean PR ? 5 ind h?1 (in
t least one season). Additionally, to assess the relevance of each
ecruitment ground for the common octopus pre-recruits, an index
f exclusiveness, EI was calculated as the ratio between PR and
he total species abundance. To verify whether the recruitment
rounds were located in the same area consistently through time,
n index of persistence, PI (adapted from Garofalo et al., 2010)
as also estimated as the proportion of cruises within each season
uring which a given recruitment ground was actually used.

To analyze the spatial distribution, the sampled area was  divided
nto 3 regions, which are environmentally different, and 13 areas.
o analyze distribution with depth (DepthZ), the sampling stations
ere also assigned to the inner-shelf (is,&amp;lt;40 m),  middle-shelf (ms,

0–90 m),  outer-shelf (os, 90–200 m),  and slope (s, &gt;200 m).  The
istance of each sampling station to the coast line (Dcoast) was also
stimated. Total pressure (PRS) in each sampling station was esti-
ated from bottom depth. A measure of RR by cruise and area was

alculated as the total runoff in each of the 13 areas. A measure of RA
y cruise and area was calculated as the total rainfall for the period
f each survey cruise recorded in the main coastal city in each of the
3 areas. These values were replicated and assigned to each samp-

ing station within each area. Mean pre-recruit abundance was
alculated in relation to categorized temporal, spatial and physical
ariables. The effects of these explanatory variables on pre-recruit
bundances were investigated using one-way ANOVA, after check-
ng for normality in the sample distributions (Shapiro test), and for
omogeneity of variances (Bartlett test). The interactions between
egion and the other variables and the interactions between Sea-
on and the other variables, were also tested by two-way ANOVA.
he relationships between log-transformed pre-recruit abundance
log PR) and the continuous physical explanatory variables: Dcoast,
RES, SST, SBT, SSS, SBS, RA, and log-transformed RR (log RR) were
urther investigated using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs),
hereby allowing non-linearity in the relationships to be taken

nto account. Since log PR was normally distributed we used a
aussian GAM with identity link. The nominal variables Year and
S were also included in models. For all continuous explanatory
ariables, degrees of freedom were constrained to be less than 5
8 + 214 78.5 444.2
1 + 187 78.6 307.7
3 + 372 70.2 390.5

to avoid overfitting. Models were fitted using a backwards selec-
tion starting with full models and removing explanatory variables
with non-significant partial effects. The Akaike Information Crite-
rion (AIC) was used to choose the best fitting model (lowest AIC).
More information about these techniques can be found in Zuur
et al. (2007). Preferred habitat (highest mean PR) and habitat limits
(PR &amp;lt;1 ind h?1) for O. vulgaris pre-recruits within the sampled area
were estimated as proxies of EFH for this key life stage.

3. Results

3.1. Environmental variation along the Portuguese continental
shelf

Over the Portuguese continental shelf SST is much higher in
autumn than in winter and was ca. 2–4 ?C lower in the NW region
than in the S region. Within the period analysed autumn SST ranged
between 14.0 ?C and 21.7 ?C and winter SST ranged between 11.6 ?C
and 16.6 ?C (Fig. 2a). There was little seasonal variation in the mean
SBT (13.9 ± 0.9 ?C), but SBT was  on average ?1.5 ?C lower in the NW
region than in the S region. Autumn SBT ranged between 11.4 ?C and
17.3 ?C, and winter SBT ranged between 11.7 ?C and 15.8 ?C (Fig. 2b).
In autumn the water column was  still stratified and important dif-
ferences existed between SST and SBT, especially in the SW and S
regions (?5 ?C). On the contrary SST was only slightly higher than
SBT during the winter period of water column mixing, namely in
the NW region (?0.5 ?C).

The expected positive correlation between temperature and
salinity may  be observed in the spatial variation of salinity which is
similar to that of temperature, decreasing with increasing latitude
and also away from the influence of the highly saline Mediter-
ranean waters. Despite this fact, both mean SSS and mean SBS
along the Portuguese shelf were lower in autumn (when temper-
ature was higher) than in winter (Fig. 2c and d). Rainfall levels
during autumn and winter were similar between areas 1 and 10,
but towards the north rainfall increased substantially, especially
during autumn (Fig. 3a). The highest river runoff levels occurred
in autumn, located in areas 7, 10, 12 and 13 (Fig. 3b), associated
mainly with the rivers Tagus, Mondego, Douro and Lima, respec-
tively. The low saline waters from these river discharges generally
spread along the west coast in a poleward direction, therefore with
no influence in the areas south of area 7. The seasonal differences in
salinity derive most likely from the higher levels of autumn rainfall
and consequent river discharges, which contributed to a decrease
in salinity of coastal waters which is more significant in autumn
than in winter.

3.2. Recruitment grounds
O. vulgaris pre-recruits were quite frequent (55–83% of
total octopus catches) both during the autumn and winter
research surveys and were represented by specimens with a mean
body weight of 300–450 g (Table 1). They were widely distributed

Fig. 4. Distribution and abundance of O. vulgaris pre-r

long the Portuguese coast, but an important seasonality in their
istribution and abundance was apparent: in winter, octopus pre-
ecruits were more abundant and their distribution shifted towards
he south (Fig. 4). In winter abundance was twice as high (mean
R ? 6 ind h?1) as in autumn (mean PR ? 3 ind h?1), in particular
uring the winter 2005 and winter 2008 surveys. However, in the
W region, pre-recruit abundance was higher in autumn, espe-
ially in the autumn1996 survey. Within each season abundance
as much higher in the S region, especially in area 2, where the

oncentration of pre-recruits was recurrent each year.
Pre-recruits were found aggregated in eight distinct grounds, A

o H. In the NW region three recruitment grounds were identified
uring autumn (Fig. 5a), located close to the mouth of river Lima
A, only present in autumn1996 survey); close to river Douro and
he lagoon system of Ria de Aveiro (B); and south of river Mon-
ego (C). During winter (Fig. 5b), the recruitment ground B shifted
o the southern part of Ria de Aveiro, partially merging with C. In
he SW region, three recruitment grounds were also identified: D
ocated at ?140 m in autumn in the vicinity of the Nazaré canyon
nd shifted southwards closer to the mouth of river Tagus in win-
er; E in area 6, close to the estuary of the river Sado with higher PR
n winter; and the recruitment ground F in areas 4 and 5 extending
rom the coastline to offshore of the 130 m isobath in winter. In
he S region the highest concentration of pre-recruits was located
est of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa (H) in autumn (mean

bove 30 ind h?1). The whole S region could be considered a sin-

le recruitment ground in winter. Despite this, based on spatial
ifferences in abundance within this region, two  distinct areas of
oncentration of pre-recruits may  be identified: the recruitment
round G centred in area 3; and H with the highest concentration
s in (a) the autumn and (b) the winter survey cruises.

of pre-recruits (winter mean above 80 ind h?1), centred in area 2
west of the lagoon system of Ria Formosa, as was  in autumn, but
spreading eastwards into area 1.

The location of each recruitment ground is summarized in
Table 2. Overall, the most persistent recruitment grounds, with
PI = 1, were the recruitment grounds F and G in winter and H both
in autumn and winter. Additionally, these grounds were important
habitats in particular for pre-recruits, showing high levels of exclu-
siveness (EI). The recruitment grounds in the NW region showed
high EI but low PI, giving evidence of higher inter-annual variation
in pre-recruit distribution within this region.

3.3. Environmental effects and essential habitat

ANOVA results indicated that the individual effects of all
temporal, spatial and physical variables analyzed on pre-recruit
abundance were significant. The effects of the explanatory variables
Year, DepthZ, Dcoast, BS, SST and SBT were significantly dependent
on Region, but independent from any seasonal effects (except for
SST) (Table 3). The effects of the physical variables related to water
salinity: SSS, SBS, RA, and RR, were independent both of Region and
Season.

To further investigate the relationships between physical vari-
ables and pre-recruit abundance, GAMs were fitted separately for
the NW,  SW and S regions using the above mentioned “explanatory
variables”: Region interactions. The optimum models are listed

in Table 4. The best-fit GAM for pre-recruit abundance in the
NW region explains about 47% of deviance and has the form:
log PR ? 1 + factor(Year) + factor(Season) + factor(BS) + s(Dcoast) +
s(SST) + s(SBS) + s(log RR). The best-fit GAM for the SW

ith the categorical variables Year, Season, DepthZ, Dcoast, and BS

n each region is depicted in Fig. 6. Pre-recruit abundance presented
n important inter-annual variation within each region (Fig. 6a),
articularly high in autumn 1996 on the NW region and in autumn
004 on the S region. During winter, the abundance was very high

n 2005, 2006 and 2008 in the S region and in 2007 in the SW region.
n the west regions the Year effect explained some variability not
ccounted by the other explanatory variables considered (Table 4).
n the other hand, the Year effect was not retained in the optimum
AM for the S region.

Pre-recruit’ habitat includes a variety of bottom sediments, but
hey seemed to concentrate preferentially over large grain sedi-
ents in relation to fine sand or mud  (Fig. 6b). Their abundance was

on a bottom sediments type map  (online figure) showed that those
in the SW region were located over several BS, all neighbouring
rock outcrops.

Pre-recruits were concentrated mainly in the middle-shelf at a
mean depth of 79 m (±44 SD) on the NW region, 108 m (±45 SD)
in the SW region, and 66 m (±31 SD) in the S region, with insignif-
icant seasonal variation in the preferred depth zone (Fig. 6c). The
highest abundances were located at 19 km (±9 SD) from the coast-
line in the NW region, 11 km (±6 SD) in the SW region, and 13 km
(±3 SD) in the S region (Fig. 6d). The distribution limit was slightly
deeper in winter (360 m)  than in autumn (332 m),  but abundances
on the slope deeper than 350 m (PRS &gt; 35.7 atm) were consistently
rather low (Table 5, PR &amp;lt;1 ind h?1). In the SW region, because the
continental shelf is narrow and steep, pre-recruits aggregated on
the middle-shelf deeper than in the other regions (see also Table 2).
Nevertheless, distribution on the west coast was mainly affected by
the distance to the coast line (Dcoast) rather than by total pressure
(PRS). Abundance decreased linearly with increasing distance to the

coast line; gradually on the wider continental shelf of the NW region
(Fig. 7a), and more obviously on the narrow and steeper continental
shelf of the SW region (Fig. 7e). On the other hand, pre-recruit distri-
bution in the S region was mainly affected by PRS, with abundance

Pre-recruit abundance was  consistently higher in the more
saline waters, with salinity ?36.0, independently of any regional
or seasonal effects. The effect of SSS was not relevant to explain
pre-recruit distribution, but in the NW region abundance increased
with SBS between 35.5 and 36.2 where most data were obtained.
Moreover, the exceptional occurrence of recruitment ground A was
probably related to the unusual high salinities in area 13 verified in
the autumn1996 survey. Episodic lower salinities also introduced
some complexity to the SBS effect on this region (Fig. 7c). SBS
also explained also the location of recruitment grounds in the SW
region: pre-recruit abundance increased with increasing SBS until
a maximum of ca. 36.1, decreasing towards the saltiest waters
(Fig. 7f). In general, pre-recruit habitat was limited by SBS below
35.60 and above 36.30 (Table 5).

Higher concentrations of pre-recruits were also related to areas
with relatively low rainfall (preferred RA = 166 ± 82 mm), such as
in the S region (Table 5). However, rainfall was  not relevant to
explain pre-recruit distribution within each region (Table 4). Sim-
ilarly, the highest concentrations of pre-recruits were found in the
S region, where there is considerably less river runoff than on the
west coast (Fig. 3b). Both in the NW and SW regions, distribution
and abundance were significantly affected by RR. Although the
main recruitment grounds were located close to the main rivers
and lagoon systems, i.e. associated with areas with important river
runoff, abundance decreased under the highest runoff levels of the
NW region (Fig. 7d). This negative effect was not observed in the
SW region (Fig. 7g), despite the important RR levels which occurred
in area 7 (Fig. 3b).

4. Discussion

O. vulgaris pre-recruits were widely distributed along the Por-
tuguese coast. The abundance was substantially higher in the
south coastal waters than on the west coast as expected, consid-
ering that the general distribution of this species in the Eastern
Atlantic have the highest densities towards the south, namely on
the north-western coasts of Africa (Balguerías et al., 2000). Pre-
recruit distribution in Portuguese waters was  patchy and animals
aggregated in several recruitment grounds. The area surrounding
the lagoon system “Ria de Aveiro” seems to be the most impor-
tant recruitment ground for O. vulgaris in the NW region, and in the
SW region pre-recruits aggregated in recruitment grounds close to
the Tagus and Sado estuaries. Moreover, in the S region, despite the
whole continental shelf showed a high abundance of small octopus,
they were aggregated more abundantly close to the lagoon system
“Ria Formosa”. Consequently, some of the most important recruit-
ment grounds of O. vulgaris are located in the vicinity of estuarine or
lagoon systems. These are highly productive ecosystems with high
abundance and diversity of marine fish and invertebrate species,
providing excellent feeding conditions to the young stages of many
species (Cabral et al., 2007). Species such as O. vulgaris,  which are
stenohaline in all life stages, are not estuarine inhabitants, but may
take advantage of these productive ecosystems by living in their
vicinity.

The common octopus is known to be a coastal benthic species,
living from 0 to 510 m in the Atlantic coasts (unpublished data),
but mostly restricted to depths below 100 m,  both in the East-
ern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean (Guerra, 1981; Belcari et al.,
2002). In Portuguese waters, as in other areas of the O. vulgaris
occurrence, juveniles and sub-adults generally aggregate in coastal
waters at a relatively short distance from the coastline. This is
dances of O. vulgaris captured by bottom trawl surveys (mostly
pre-recruits) were found within the depth range of 10–50 m by
Belcari et al. (2002). Similarly, sub-adult densities are higher in

hallow waters (20–40 m)  than further offshore on the NW African
oasts (Faraj and Bez, 2007). Even so, these authors located the
referred distribution of small octopus further inshore than the
ain recruitment grounds identified along the Portuguese coast.

n contrast, a different demographic distribution was  described
y Belcari et al. (2002), Quetglas et al. (1998) and Sánchez and
barti (1993) for the Western Mediterranean and by Hernández-
arcia et al. (1997) for the Canary Islands, as they all observed

 wider bathymetric distribution of the small animals. In Por-
uguese waters we also found a wide distribution of O. vulgaris
re-recruits, with aggregations centred at mean depths of ?80 m,
nd at approximately 10–15 km from the coast. However, the
urveyed area of the cruises analyzed provides poor coverage of
he inner-shelf, especially in the S region (see Fig. 1), the region
here the abundance was the highest, which may  have con-

ributed to an overestimation of the pre-recruit preferred depth
r distance to the coast line. Overcoming this sampling constraint,
oth the spatial distribution predicted by geostatistical interpo-

ation of abundance and the GAM modelling of the Depth or
coast effects on PR for each region indicated that PR increases

owards shallow waters, and for that reason the main recruit-
ent grounds should in general be located in even more coastal

reas.
O. vulgaris adults are equally abundant over a variety of sediment

ypes (Mangold, 1983). Nevertheless, we observed that sub-adults
ave a preference for large grain sediments, namely gravel and
oarse sand. Despite the lack of sampling over the rocky ocean
oor, we found also the pre-recruit distribution to be closely related
o the proximity of rocky bottoms and abundance over mud  with
ock outcrops significantly higher than over soft mud. This posi-

ive relationship between small size octopus density and sediment
rain size was also documented by Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos
2004a) in Greek waters. This sediment type preference is, to some
xtent, related to their necessity of sheltering to avoid predation,
(grey bar) and S (white bar) regions by (a) in each research cruise (Year), (b) bottom

and octopuses do it either selecting or building shelters (“dens”) in
the substratum (Mather, 1988).

The relationships between pre-recruit abundance and several
abiotic environmental variables were analyzed to delineate pre-
recruit optimum habitat and eventual environmental limitations to
their distribution. Using presence–absence data, Hermosilla et al.
(2011) modelled the distribution and large-scale habitat prefer-
ences of O. vulgaris in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean and
concluded that the area used by octopus differs from the average
available environmental conditions in terms of bottom tempera-
ture and bottom salinity.

In Portuguese waters salinity proved to be an important
determinant for the aggregation of O. vulgaris pre-recruits. Their
distribution was  limited by SBS below 35.60 and above 36.30 and
the preferred habitat was characterized by salinities of ?36.0. The
highest abundance was  hence observed in the S region, where
both rainfall and river runoff are generally low and mean sea-
sonal SBS has a narrow range (36.01–36.21, Fig. 2d). Within its
global distribution this species prefers habitats with bottom salin-
ity between 30 and 45 (Hermosilla et al., 2011), and is fairly
abundant under salinities at least up to 39 (e.g. in the Greek
Seas, Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2004a). Thus, the reason why
we observed a negative effect of salinities above 36.03 in Por-
tuguese waters may  be partially related to the low availability
of more saline waters in the study area, or that the negative
effect relates to regional environmental tolerances. At the same
time, low salinity is a limitation for octopus survival (Chapela
et al., 2006; Vaz-Pires et al., 2004) and hence constrains its
distribution. The negative effect of SBS was  mainly observed
on the west coast. Here, salinities generally fall below 36.0 in

autumn and winter, especially in the northern area, caused by
heavy rainfall and subsequent important river discharges. Despite
this, as mentioned before, several recruitment grounds were
identified close to large rivers and lagoon systems (although this

og  transformed river runoff (log RR), and (h) total pressure (PRS) on pre-recruit ab
ndicates 95% confidence intervals around the main effects. The density of tick mar

oes not equate to low salinity water). The proximity to estua-
ine systems provides an increased availability of prey, for example
ivalves, but greatly enhances the risk of low salinity episodes. In
act, mass mortality episodes of O. vulgaris have sometimes been
eported on the Portuguese coast and have been related to sud-
en falls in water salinity due to intense river discharges, following
eavy rainfall periods (Ruano, 2011).

The effect of temperature on pre-recruits distribution was  also
mportant, even if less significant than salinity. It was  observed that
ST affects the distribution and abundance of octopus paralarvae
n their zooplanktonic habitat (González et al., 2005; Moreno et al.,
009). However, it is expected that the subsequent life stages, living

trongly associated with the ocean floor, suffer a more intense (or
irect) influence of the temperature near the bottom. Pre-recruits
ere found associated prefererentially with SBT between 15 and

6 ?C and the main recruitment grounds were limited to mean
ce (PR) on the northwest (NW), southwest (SW) and south (S) coasts. Shaded area

SBT &gt; 13.6 ?C. Similarly to the general distribution of the species
in relation to the available environment described by Hermosilla
and co-workers (2011), we found that the pre-recruits of
O. vulgaris concentrate also under the warmest temperatures.
On the other hand, if compared with the habitat modelling in
Hermosilla et al. (2011), cold water (SBT &amp;lt;12 ?C) seems to impose
a more pronounced limitation on pre-recruit distribution than to
adult distribution. During the surveys analyzed, SBT was  quite sta-
ble within each region and no significant effect of this variable on PR
was  retained by the GAMs. Even so, in the NW region we observed
important seasonal and inter-annual variation in distribution and
abundance of pre-recruits which may  stand for seasonal and yearly

differences in SBT (e.g. unusual low SBT in autumn 2004). Even if
temperature at the surface supposedly has less effect on the life
stages living on the bottom, we found a significant effect of SST on
pre-recruit distribution (positive in the west regions and negative

n the S region). Pre-recruit preferred habitat was characterized by
STs of 15.3–16.0 ?C and limited by SST &amp;lt;13 ?C. Furthermore, SSTs
bove 21 ?C seem to have constrained the eastwards spread of the
ecruitment ground H in the S region in 2003. In this region the
ear effect was not retained in the optimum GAM for the S region
nd consequently the inter-annual variation in pre-recruit abun-
ance in this region must be explained essentially by SST (the only
ariable in the model affected by yearly changes).

Other studies which modelled O. vulgaris abundance in relation
o environmental variables found that oceanographic conditions
lay a very significant role in determining the distribution and
bundance during the paralarval phase (e.g. Moreno et al., 2009;
tero et al., 2009). Inter-relationships between paralarval distribu-

ion, settlement and recruitment ground locations are still largely
nknown. This is a field in which much work is still required and
hat we expect will be evolving in the near future.

Based on pre-recruit abundance, PI and EI together we may  con-
ider the winter recruitment grounds D and F in the SW region, and

 and H in the S region, as the main pre-recruit hot spots on the
ortuguese continental shelf, where these animals meet their opti-
um  habitat. The Ria Formosa recruitment ground (H) is probably

he most important O. vulgaris pre-recruit hot spot along the Por-
uguese coast, showing the highest abundances both in autumn
nd in winter. Important recruitment grounds were also observed
n the NW region close to Ria the Aveiro (B) and south of the mouth
f the river Mondego (C), but pre-recruit abundance showed larger
nter-annual variation, probably associated with the environmental
ynamics of the local upwelling ecosystem.

Overall, the distribution pattern of pre-recruits predicted by the
patial interpolation might have missed the identification of some
mportant aggregation areas. Indeed, the model predicted a low
oncentration of small octopuses in the eastern part of the south
oast. Notwithstanding, according to fishermen surveys, in this part
f the coast aggregations occur in very shallow waters (6–12 m
epth) between October and December, with higher concentrations

n front of the inlets of the Ria Formosa lagoon and near the estu-
ry of the river Guadiana. In these areas, there is high abundance
f prey, mainly bivalves (Rufino et al., 2010), and the substrate is
oarse (Rosa et al., 2013) with a high fraction of bioclasts consti-
uted by large molluscan shells fragments where small octopuses
an hide. Altogether, food availability and habitat characteristics
ight explain the high concentration of pre-recruits in this part of

he coast. Similarly, fishermen also reported that small-sized octo-
uses are numerous during winter in the westernmost part of the
outh coast (between Lagos and Sagres), especially near the rocky
utcrops in inshore waters, where they find refuge from predators.

The recruitment grounds in the proximity of Ria de Aveiro and
lose to Ria Formosa are areas subject to intense fishing activity: the
rtisanal fishery (traps and pots) exploits the inshore part and the
ottom trawl fishery exploits the offshore part of those recruitment
rounds (Fonseca et al., 2008). In principle, Portuguese fishery reg-
lations determine that small animals (&lt;750 g) are to be returned
o the water if caught, which if respected would suffice to maintain
he safety of octopus recruitment grounds, regardless of the type
f activity in the area. Nevertheless, the identification of a spatially
estricted critical area could be useful to reinforce the legislation.

This study was an essential first step towards the understand-
ng of O. vulgaris pre-recruits essential habitat. Nevertheless, we
ecognize that further information should be obtained in future
tudies to complement and refine our research. First of all, abun-
ance based on trawl data should be complemented with data from
ther sources because the efficiency of a fishing trawl depends

n the type of dens that the octopuses use in the surveyed area,
hich varies in relation to depth, octopus size, and sediment type

Katsanevakis and Verriopoulos, 2004b). Additionally, it would be
esirable to include other sources of abundance data to have a
arch 152 (2014) 74– 85

better coverage of octopus distribution over the inner-shelf, and in
areas with extensive deployment of artisanal fishing gears, where
survey sampling is often compromised. More input derived from
“Fishers’ ecological knowledge” (FEK) would be desirable in future
studies.
