Abstract: Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of water 
and sediment characteristics on the abundance, richness and diversity of the benthic 
invertebrate community in Peri lagoon, a freshwater coastal lagoon located in central 
coast of Santa Catarina State; Methods: Samplings were performed in April, May and 
June 2009, in five different sites of Peri lagoon. The samples were taken with an Eckman-
Birge drag, totalizing 60 for the invertebrate community, and 45 for sediment. Water 
physicochemical variables were also measured. Environmental influences in benthic 
community have been measured using a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). 
Linear regressions were also plotted for main correlations; Results: A total of 5,535 
specimens were collected, identified into 18 taxa. Tanaidacea was the most abundant 
representing 54% of relative abundance, followed by Diptera (23%), and Ostracoda 
(17%). The richest family was Chironomidae with 6 taxa. CCA results indicated positive 
correlation between Chaoborus and Stenocypris with local depth, and negative correlation 
between Odonata, Gastropoda, Cytheridella and Coleoptera with the finest grains of 
sediment, as well as between Tanaidacea, Lopescladius, Annelida and Nematoda with both 
organic matter (OM) content in sediment and local depth. Linear regression analysis 
demonstrated inverse relation of Tanaidacea in response to OM (y =  0.6 – 0.62.OM) 
and sand (y = 0.6 – 0.6.sand), and of Lopescladius in response to OM (y = 0.37 – 0.41.
OM) and sand (y = 0.37 – 0.46.sand). The fact that Peri lagoon has no marine influence 
and has Tanaidacea as the most abundant taxa, a group not expected in freshwaters, 
gives to this lagoon a particular relevance among coastal lagoons. The study concluded 
that sediment characteristics and local depth are more significant than water variables in 
determining the benthic community structure in Peri lagoon, which varied in accordance 
with different local conditions.

Keywords: benthic community, richness and diversity, lentic system.

reservoirs, and benthic communities are still poorly 
understood. 

We studied the structure and composition of the 
benthic invertebrate community in Peri lagoon, a 
subtropical coastal lagoon which acts as a freshwater 
reservoir, aiming to examine the correlation between 
these community and particular characteristics of 
water and sediment.

2. Material and Methods

2.1.Study area

Peri lagoon (27° 44’ S and 48° 31’ W) is located 
in the southern region of the Florianópolis island, 
central coast of Santa Catarina (Figure  1). The 
lagoon’s surface area of 5.7 km2 is surrounded by 
mountains covered with well preserved Atlantic 
Rain Forest in the northern, western and southern 
portions, and by “restinga” vegetation in the eastern 
portion. The climate in the area is characteristically 
subtropical, with rainfall well distributed along 
the year, but concentrated in spring and summer 
months (October–March) (Hennemann and 
Petrucio, 2010).

Peri lagoon is a freshwater coastal lagoon 
without marine influences (freshwater all over the 
year), making from it the main freshwater resource 
in the Florianópolis’s island. A water supply network 
is working at the lagoon with mean capacity of 
200  L/s, providing water for five districts of the 
municipality. Thus, almost the entire area of 
the Peri Lagoon Watershed is situated within an 
environmentally protected area since 1981, with 
restricted human occupation. 

2.2.Data sampling

Samplings were carried out three times, 
respectively in April, May and June 2009. Five 
different sites were chosen in Peri Lagoon (Figure 1). 
The samples sites were selected considering an 
adequate representation of the different parts of the 

1. Introduction

Benthic invertebrates are a component of aquatic 
communities with a large distribution and a strong 
interaction with environmental conditions (Moretti 
and Callisto, 2005; Würdig et al., 2007). They play 
a key role in the nutrient cycling and energy flow 
of aquatic environments, acting in organic matter 
breakdown process and taking effectively part in 
ecosystems biogeochemical cycles (Covich  et  al., 
1999; Strixino and Trivinho-Strixino, 2006). This 
faunal component has been frequently used in 
environmental quality assessment (Guimarães et al., 
2009; Mugnai et al., 2010).

This community shows a different distribution 
in space and time, varying in accordance with 
water physical-chemical conditions (Pereira and 
De  Luca, 2003), substrate type and organic 
matter content in sediment (Covich et al., 1999), 
influence of macrophytes (Kevrekidis, 2004), and 
local depth (Pamplin and Rocha, 2007). Because 
the environmental heterogeneity, these variables 
may differ in distinct areas of lakes, wetlands and 
streams, determining changes in the structure and 
distribution of benthos (Würdig et al., 2007).

Considering the aquatic ecosystems in general, 
the coastal lagoons and estuaries demonstrate 
a strong interaction between benthos and the 
water column (Bemvenuti and Rosa-Filho, 2000). 
Additionally, these environments provide nursery 
habitats for various species (Almeida et al., 2008). 
These ecosystems are complex environments 
that experience large fluctuations in abiotic 
variables associated with drastic changes in the 
structure of assemblages (Carvalho  et  al., 2011). 
Nevertheless, there is no general consensus on 
which environmental variables are more important 
in structuring invertebrate assemblages in these 
ecosystems. Many studies have shown that salinity is 
the most important factor determining the benthic 
community structure (Gamito, 2006; Pech et al., 
2007; Almeida  et  al., 2008). There is, however, 
a lack of studies about coastal lagoons that act as 

local. Regressões lineares demonstraram uma relação inversa de Tanaidacea em resposta 
a MO (y = 0.6 – 0.62.MO) e areia grossa (y = 0.6 – 0.6.are) assim como de Lopescladius 
em relação a MO (y = 0.37 – 0.41.MO) e areia grossa (y = 0.37 – 0.46.are). O fato da 
lagoa do Peri não ter influência do mar e ter Tanaidacea como táxon mais abundante, um 
grupo não esperado em ambientes de água doce, lhe confere destaque entre demais lagoas 
costeiras do Brasil. Através deste estudo concluímos que as características de sedimento 
e profundidade local foram mais importantes que variáveis da água na determinação da 
estrutura da comunidade de invertebradoss bentônicos na lagoa do Peri, que variou de 
acordo com características ambientais locais.

2.3.Data analyses

The statistical treatment was made considering 
the mean values of the three months together, and 
all data were log transformed prior to analyses. 
The work was carried out using community mean 
densities (ind.  225  cm–2) and environmental 
parameters, which were normalized using Primer 
6 Beta software. Univariate analyses of variance 
(ANOVA) were used to test for differences in 
the environmental measured parameters of water 
and sediment, and in invertebrate community 
densities between the sampling sites. Pearson 
Correlation coefficients “r” were used to identify 
significant correlations between community taxa 
and environmental variables. Stepwise regressions 
were used to illustrate the response of main 
community taxa to their main environmental 
variables. The relationship between environmental 
variables and invertebrate community structure was 
explored by means of a Canonical Correspondence 
Analysis (CCA) biplot distribution, tested with 
Mont Carlo significance levels, using Canoco for 
Windows 4.5 software. ANOVA, Pearson’s “r”, and 
linear regressions were calculated using Statistica 7 
software.

3. Results

The summary of environmental variables values 
of water and sediment measured in the five sampling 
sites is presented in Table 1. Depth was higher in P1, 
with a maximum of 9 m in April, and it achieved 

lagoon, ranging the northern (P5), central (P1) and 
southern (P3) regions, and describing deep (P1) and 
shallow (P4) areas, both in a mouth of rivers (P2 
and P3) or in other areas (P5, P4, P1) (Figure 1).

In each sampling site four samples using 
an Ekman-Birge grab (15  ×15  cm) were taken 
for invertebrate analyses, and three samples for 
sediment analyses (mean grain size and percentage 
of organic matter), totalizing 105 samples in the 
studied period. The samples were washed under 
running water using 250 µm mesh sieves, and all 
invertebrates retained were sorted, counted and 
preserved in 70% ethanol. The aquatic fauna were 
sorted under stereo microscope and identified to the 
lowest possible taxonomic level using identification 
keys by Fernández and Domínguez (2001) and 
Mugnai et al. (2010). The organisms belonging to 
the Chironomidae family were mounted on semi-
permanent slides and subsequently identified under 
stereomicroscope, according to Trivinho-Strixino 
and Strixino (1995).

Water was collected in Sechis disc depth for 
analyses. The water temperature (°C), conductivity 
(µS.cm–1), pH and dissolved oxygen (mg.L–1) 
were measured in situ at each sampling station 
with the specific probe WTW-Multi  350i. Local 
depth (m) was also measured. The granulometric 
composition of the sediment was determined by 
sieving in laboratory, and grain size was classified 
into 3 size classes according to the granulometric 
scale of Suguio (1973). Organic matter content was 
determined by ignition (7 g of sediment burnt at 
550 °C during 4 hours).

among the sampling sites (F  =  5.16, p  =  0.03). 
Total abundance and species richness between the 
five sampling sites ranged from 201 individuals 
in P5 and 9 taxa in P3 to 4,131 individuals and 
14 taxa in P4. In the central site (P1) Ostracoda 
predominated with the highest abundance, followed 
by Chaoborus. In the two southern sites (P2 and 
P3) Chironomus predominated followed by the 
ostracode Cytheridella ilosvayi Daday, 1905. In site 
P4 Tanaidacea was the predominant taxa, and in 
the northern site (P5) Chironomus and Coelotanypus 
predominated.

Tanaidacea densities found in Peri lagoon were 
extremely high in P4, reaching more than 10,000 
individuals per  m–2, despite the low densities 
observed in others sites. C. ilosvayi was also present 
in high density in P3, reaching 1,818.5  ind.m–2, 
and the quironomid Lopescladius presented a density 
of 1,655.5 ind.m–2 also in P4. The lowest density 
among sample sites were observed in P5 with 
744.4  ind.m–2, and the highest one was observed 
in P4, which presented 15,300 ind.m–2.

According to the CCA between the mean 
environmental variables and community densities 
of the five different sampling sites, the main 
environmental variables that determined the 
community structure were organic matter content 
in sediment, coarse grains and water depth (Table 3). 
The first two components of CCA explained 61.4% 
of total community variability (Figure 2). The first 
axis accounted with 36.1% (Monte Carlo test 
p-value  =  0.002) and the second accounted with 
others 25.3% (Monte Carlo significances test of all 
canonical axes p-value = 0.03). 

In accordance with CCA analysis, it was possible 
to observe that Chaoborus and Stenocypris  major 
Baird, 1859 were positively correlated with water 
depth. In the other hand, Annelida and Tanaidacea 
were negatively correlated with this variable, and 
they also showed to be negatively correlated with 

the minimum value in P4 with 1.3 m, measured in 
the same month. 

Water variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature and conductivity) did not show 
significant differences between the sampling sites 
(F = 0.5, p = 0.91). Water temperature showed a 
decreasing tendency along the sampling months due 
to the subtropical climate. Oxygen concentrations 
have presented an inverse tendency to water 
temperature, in which the concentrations increased 
with the decrease of the last.

The organic matter percentages in sediment 
were higher in P2 and P1 (35.12 and 30.34%), and 
smaller in P4 and P5 (3.45 and 3.84%). Sediment 
of Peri lagoon was quite heterogeneous in relation 
to the granulometric composition, with mean 
values of sand ranging from 3.59% in site P4 to 
32.22% in site P2, and mean values of silt ranging 
from 44.23% in site P2 to 78.76% in site P4 
(Table 1). ANOVA showed significant differences 
of granulometric composition and organic matter 
contents in sediment among the sampling sites 
(F = 2.89, p = 0.01).

The aquatic invertebrate community was 
described on the basis of mean densities (ind.m–2), 
taxonomic richness and relative abundance 
(Table 2). A total of 5,535 specimens of fauna were 
collected in the sediment, distributed in 18 taxa 
and 6 classes. Chironomidae was the more diverse 
taxa, presenting 6 genus (Table 2). Crustacea was 
the numerically dominant taxa, representing more 
than 70% of the community, where the group 
Tanaidacea showed 54.2% of these amount, and 
Ostracoda 17.4%. The second most abundant group 
was Diptera, representing more than 23% of the 
relative abundance, mainly with the genus of the 
Chironomidae Lopescladius (8.3%), Chironomus 
(6.7%) and Coelotanypus (4.6%).

Invertebrate community composition and 
abundance in Peri lagoon varied significantly

Figure 3 illustrate the responses of Tanaidacea, 
that represents the most abundant taxa of the 
lagoon, and Lopescladius, that represents the main 
quironomid genus, to organic matter content and 
percentage of sand in sediment, respectively the 
main environmental variables that structured these 
groups. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient for 
these taxa was calculated against all environmental 
variables, considering only significant (p &amp;lt;  0.05) 
variables for each taxa to make the regressions.

For the tanaids group, organic matter content in 
sediment was a core explanatory factor (r2 = 0.44, 

organic matter content in the sediment, while 
Chironominae showed to be positively correlated 
with this variable.

The groups Trichoptera and Tanypodinae 
demonstrated a positive correlation with water 
temperature and silt particles of the sediment. In 
the other hand, Gomphidae and C.  ilosvayi, and 
even Gastropoda, Libellulidae and Coleoptera 
showed to be negatively correlated with the finest 
particles of the sediment (silt), and demonstrated 
a positive correlation with sand, clay, and water 
oxygen concentrations (Figure 2).

negative correlation with OM content (r2 = 0.41, 
p = 0.01) and sand percentage (r2 = 0.54, p = 0.001) 
in sediment, this last one explaining more than 50% 
of its variability (Figure 3).

4. Discussion

Among the measured environmental variables of 
Peri lagoon, organic matter percentage in sediment, 
granulometric composition and local depth 
explained the largest proportion of the structure 
and distribution of benthic community. This was 
subjected to the spatial variability of physics and 
chemical variables of the lagoon, primarily to the 
characteristics of sediment and local depth. In fact, 
studies on lentic ecosystems came to the conclusion 
that environmental factors such as organic matter 
content in sediment (Würdig  et  al., 1998; 
Cartier et al., 2010) and grain sizes (Cenzano and 
Würdig, 2006; Würdig et al., 2007) are considered 
explanatory variables for density and distribution 
of benthic community. In the other hand, size and 
habitat structure seems to play an important role 
on invertebrate community composition (Heino, 
2000), and even water temperature and influence 
of macrophytes could have a key role structuring 
this community (Kevrekidis, 2004).

p  =  0.007) with negative correlation. We found 
evidence that the percentage of sand in sediment is 
also determinant for the variation of these group, 
showing a direct negative relation with tanaids 
density (r2 = 0.42, p = 0.009). The most abundant

and Cartier  et  al. (2010). The low dominance of 
Annelida (3% of the relative abundance), compared 
with the findings of Cenzano and Würdig (2006) 
and Würdig  et  al. (2007) in other Brazilians 
coastal lagoons, may attest the good quality of the 
lagoon ecosystem. Hypothetically, it could also 
be considered if the low dominance of Annelida 
presents a correlation to oligotrophic for nutrients 
concentrations, as shown by Hennemann and 
Petrucio (2010). 

Evident correlation between Chaoborus and 
water depth observed in this study has been 
established in many others studies of lentic 
environments (Arcifa, 2000; Bezerra-Neto and 
Pinto-Coelho, 2002; Pamplin and Rocha, 2007), 
and could be explained by the natural behavior 
of this group (Bezerra-Neto and Pinto-Coelho, 
2002). Nevertheless, it was Stenocypris major that 
showed the strongest correlation with water depth, 
and studies about this interaction are infrequent. 
Oligochaeta was negatively correlated with water 
depth, what was already observed by Pamplim and 
Rocha (2007), and may be explained by a better 
adaptation of these group in the site with the 
greatest density of organisms.

The direct negative relationship of Tanaidacea 
and Lopescladius, respectively the first and the third 
most important components of benthos densities, 
with OM and sand content in sediment, suggests 
that an organic enrichment in this system could 
promote drastic changes in the composition and 
abundances of aquatic invertebrate community in 
the entire lagoon. Nevertheless, few studies with 
these groups were performed in Brazilian freshwater 
systems, and their real importance is still by far 
unknown.

The present study intended solely to correlate 
the aquatic invertebrate community with water 
and sediment’s characteristics of the lagoon. Many 
other variables play also a role in the community 
structure, such as influence of macrophytes 
(Kevrekidis, 2004; Albertoni et al., 2007), predation 
intensity (Marques  et  al., 1999), habitat stability 
(Herbst and Bromley, 1984), water renewal regimes 
(Gamito, 2006) and temporal and spatial dynamics 
(Carvalho et al., 2011). A biogeographycal multi-
scale approach could also be taken into account 
(Ricklefs and Schulter, 1993).

Even with the great importance of invertebrates 
in nutrient’s cycling and ecological successional 
process of aquatic ecosystems, few studies have 
been made with these organisms in freshwater 
coastal lagoons. Despite the punctual empirical 

In coastal lagoons, however, many studies 
show that salinity is a key factor in regulating 
benthic community, assigning secondary role to 
sediment granulometric composition and organic 
matter content (Gamito, 2006; Pech et al., 2007; 
Almeida  et  al., 2008). Notwithstanding, Peri 
lagoon is situated among the infrequent coastal 
lagoons with no marine influence, besides its 
proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The presence 
of Tanaidacea is a fact that corroborates this 
ambiguity of influences. According to Jaume and 
Boxshall (2008), tanaids are essentially marines, and 
worldwide represented in freshwater systems only 
with four species. In addition, in South America 
occurs only one species (Jaume and Boxshall, 
2008). These observations make from Peri lagoon a 
conspicuous case. Being one of the first studies ever 
made on benthic communities to the Peri lagoon, 
we were able to demonstrate a presence of more 
than 50% of the relative abundance composed by 
tanaids. This dominance of crustaceans was already 
observed in other Brazilian coastal lagoons, being 
also tanaids one of the most abundant groups in 
Taim Hydrological System (Würdig et al., 2007). 
According to Würdig  et  al. (2007), a historical 
process of ecological and large temporal scale 
explains the presence of these taxa in these systems. 
In addition, Covich  et  al. (1999) have shown 
that crustaceans play important roles in aquatic 
ecosystems, mainly on detritivorous food web.

The water supply network located in Peri lagoon 
must ensure a good water quality without salinity, 
making from this coastal lagoon also a reservoir 
with a constructed barrier to control the water 
level. In spite of this consideration, we argue that 
Peri lagoon differs from other man-made reservoirs, 
that have the water level flow and regime controlled 
according to human necessities and are dominated 
by Oligochaeta and Diptera (Pamplin et al., 2006; 
Pamplin and Rocha, 2007). Peri lagoon has most of 
its dynamics governed by nature, and a community 
that is closer related to those of others coastal lagoons 
(Würdig et al., 2007). Working with semi-natural 
coastal lagoons in Southern Portugal, Gamito 
(2006) found a similar community characteristic 
of estuarine and shallow-water habitats, but in this 
case dominated by mollusks and Chironomidae. In 
the same direction, Kevrekidis (2004) observed low 
salinities Mediterranean coastal lagoons dominated 
by mollusks and amphipods.

The highest zoobenthos abundance in Peri 
lagoon was observed at the shallowest sites, in 
accordance with Cenzano and Würdig (2006)
