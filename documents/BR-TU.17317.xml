RESUMO 

A composição e biomassa do zooplâncton dos recifes de Tamandaré (PE, Brasil) foram 

investigadas com o objetivo de caracterizar esses ecossistemas como fontes ou sumidouros de 

zooplâncton para o ambiente pelágico. Foram desenvolvidos dois novos sistemas de redes 

estacionárias: a Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN) e a Reef Edge Net (REN), adaptadas 

para a coleta de zooplâncton em pontos fixos próximos aos recifes. Também foram 

desenvolvidos fatores de conversão para o cálculo da biomassa do zooplâncton, através da 

análise de imagens, com base nos dados de comprimento, diâmetro esférico equivalente, área e 

biovolume do zooplâncton de ambientes costeiros tropicais. As coletas foram realizadas durante 

noites de lua nova de 19 a 22 março e de 10 a 12 de novembro de 2015 e de 7 a 11 de março de 

2016. A camada subsuperfícial da água foi amostrada através de arrastos subsuperficiais com 

rede cônica (300 µm), com duração de 13 minutos, após o pôr do sol. As novas redes 

estacionárias (300 µm) coletaram durante 4 horas, contra o fluxo de corrente das marés 

vazantes. A REN foi ancorada na borda dos recifes e amostrou o zooplâncton “lavado” do topo 

recifal. A CMNN coletou os organismos que estavam sendo transportados para a plataforma 

continental em canais entre os recifes. Os dados obtidos com o uso da CMNN e a REN em 

comparação com a rede cônica mostraram que as novas redes são eficientes na coleta de 

zooplâncton de recifes rasos. A REN mostrou uma melhor performance na coleta de larvas de 

peixes e invertebrados bentônicos quando comparada com a CMNN e a rede cônica, 

provavelmente pela sua posição e profundidade em relação ao recife. As correlações entre os 

dados de tamanho e biomassa do zooplâncton mostraram que o biovolume foi o parâmetro mais 

adequado para mensurar a biomassa do zooplâncton de ambientes costeiros tropicais. No 

tocante às assembleias zooplanctônicas dos recifes de Tamandaré, a abundância do zooplâncton 

foi significativamente maior na subsuperfície da água e nas bordas dos recifes quando 

comparada aos canais. A abundância alta de zooplâncton registrada na borda recifal sugere que 

existe uma baixa predação desses organismos no topo dos recifes, o que pode ser explicado 

também pela baixa cobertura de corais escleractíneos e alta cobertura de macroalgas dos recifes 

do Tamandaré. Esses resultados sugerem que ao invés de sumidouros, esses ecossistemas 

podem ser classificados como fontes importantes de zooplâncton para o ambiente pelágico. O 

meroplâncton foi mais abundante em relação ao holoplâncton na borda dos recifes e canais. O 

grupo mais abundante do meroplâncton foi representado pelas larvas de decápodes. Náuplios 



 
 

de cirrípedes, larvas de estomatópodes e ovos e larvas de peixes também foram importantes. O 

meroplâncton contribuiu com mais de 50% para a biomassa do zooplâncton dos recifes de 

Tamandaré. Esse estudo mostra a relevância do meroplâncton nos sistemas pelágicos ao entorno 

de um recife tropical e sugere que a influência de larvas e ovos produzidos por peixes e 

invertebrados bentônicos residentes dos recifes tem sido subestimada em estudos que abordam 

a produtividade desses ecossistemas.

ABSTRACT 

The composition and biomass of the zooplankton of the reefs of Tamandaré (Pernambuco state, 

Brazil) were investigated aiming to characterize theses ecosystems as sources or sinks of 

zooplankton for pelagic systems. Two new systems of passive nets suitable for sampling 

zooplankton at fixed stations close to patch reefs were created: the Channel Midwater Neuston 

Net (CMNN) and the Reef Edge Net (REN). Factor conversions were created to estimate 

zooplankton biomass through image analysis based on length, equivalent spherical diameter, 

body area and biovolume of zooplankton from coastal tropical waters. Sampling was carried 

out during new moon nights from March 19 to 22 (2015), from November 10 to 12 (2015), and 

from March 7 to 11 (2016). A conical plankton net (300 µm) sampled the subsurface of the 

water in tows carried out for 13 minutes after sunset. The new passive nets (300 µm) sampled 

for 4 hours against the local current flow of ebb tides. The REN was deployed at the reef edge 

and sampled the zooplankton “washed” from reef tops. The CMNN sampled the organisms 

transported to the continental shelf through channels between reefs. The CMNN and REN were 

efficient for sampling zooplankton assemblages in shallow reefs when compared to the results 

obtained using a common conical plankton net. The REN showed a better performance for 

sampling eggs and larvae of fish and benthic invertebrates compared to the CMNN and the 

plankton net, probably due to its position and depth in relation to reefs. The correlation between 

body size and biomass of zooplankton showed that the biovolume is the best parameter to infer 

the biomass of zooplankton from tropical coastal waters. Regarding the zooplankton 

assemblages of the reefs of Tamandaré, the abundance of these organisms was higher at 

subsurface and reef edges compared to the channels. The high abundance record at the reef 

edges suggests that there is a low predation pressure on zooplankton, which may also be 

explained by the low coverage of scleractinian corals and high coverage of macroalgae on the 

reefs of Tamandaré. These results suggest that these reefs are sources instead of sinks of 

zooplankton. The meroplankton showed higher abundances than holoplankton reef edges and 

channels. Decapod larvae was the most abundant group regarding the meroplankton 

composition but cirripedian nauplii, stomatopod larvae, fish eggs and larvae were also 

important. The meroplankton composed more than 50% of zooplankton biomass in the reefs of 

Tamandaré. This study shows the relevance of meroplankton in pelagic systems adjacent to a 

tropical reef and suggests that the influence of eggs and larvae released by reef resident benthic 



 
 

invertebrates and fish have been underestimated in studies that investigate the productivity of 

these ecosystems.

1 INTRODUÇÃO  

Os recifes costeiros tropicais de águas rasas são ambientes rochosos utilizados como 

habitat por uma grande variedade de espécies marinhas. As assembleias zooplanctônicas de 

águas que banham recifes costeiros tropicais são caracterizadas pela abundância de larvas e 

ovos de animais bentônicos e pelágicos que residem nos recifes. A produção e a dispersão 

desses organismos são essenciais para o estabelecimento das comunidades recifais. Além disso, 

larvas e ovos recém eclodidos são considerados uma fonte de alimento importante para vários 

organismos planctívoros (Holzman e Genin, 2003).  

Os recifes tropicais são reconhecidos como ecossistemas produtivos, onde o que é 

produzido e importado de áreas adjacentes (ex. região oceânica) é consumido de forma rápida 

pelos organismos residentes dos recifes (Odum e Odum, 1955; Hamner et al., 2007; Nakajima 

et al., 2014; Nakajima et al., 2017). Por exemplo, os recifes de coral verdadeiros apresentam 

uma cobertura coralínea alta e uma abundância relevante de peixes recifais que causam uma 

pressão predatória intensa sobre a comunidade zooplanctônica. Os peixes planctívoros são 

predadores ativos de zooplâncton próximo à superfície do recife, principalmente durante o 

período diurno. Durante a noite, os corais abrem os seus tentáculos para se alimentarem dos 

organismos planctônicos (Holzman et al., 2005; Yahel e Yahel, 2005; Yahel et al., 2005; 

Hamner et al., 2007; Heidelberg et al., 2010). Por isso, esses ambientes representam 

verdadeiros sumidouros de zooplâncton.  

Outra característica importante desses ecossistemas é a dominância de copépodes no 

mesozooplâncton ao entorno dos recifes (Heidelberg et al., 2004; Nakajima et al., 2008; 

Alldredge e King, 2009; Heidelberg et al., 2010; Nakajima et al., 2014). Embora exista uma 

abundância relevante de espécies bentônicas e pelágicas residentes dos recifes tropicais e que 

liberam suas larvas e ovos no ambiente pelágico (como por exemplo, decápodes e peixes), a 

captura desses organismos em estágios iniciais de desenvolvimento, em amostras de 

zooplâncton coletadas com redes tradicionais, pode não retratar o verdadeiro potencial desses 

ecossistemas como produtores de meroplâncton.  

A distribuição espacial e temporal de larvas e ovos de peixes e invertebrados em 

ambientes marinhos está diretamente relacionada ao regime de correntes, temperatura, 

salinidade, concentração de organismos fitoplanctônicos na água do mar, tempo de vida das 

larvas no ambiente pelágico, taxas de mortalidade, habilidades sensoriais das larvas, presença 



20 
 

de locais apropriados para o assentamento, característica demográficas das populações de 

adultos, momento e local de desova,  etc. (Williams et al., 1984; Forward, 1987; Anger, 2001; 

Sale e Kritzer, 2003; Fernandes et al., 2012; Kough et al., 2013; Kough e Paris, 2015; Epifanio 

e Cohen, 2016; Mactavish et al., 2016). 

Em ambientes costeiros o meroplâncton vem sendo estudado com ênfase na distribuição 

vertical e temporal de larvas de poliquetas, bivalves, cirrípedes, braquiúros, camarões 

decápodes e peixes em função de mudanças nas variáveis ambientais (Ziadi et al., 2015; 

Mactavish et al., 2016) e em relação às marés, fases da lua, regime de ventos e outras variáveis 

(Criales et al., 2002; Criales et al., 2003; Criales et al., 2010; Ayata et al., 2011; Roura et al., 

2013; Blake, 2017). Entretanto, pouco se sabe sobre a contribuição do meroplâncton produzido 

pelos recifes nesses processos.     

No nordeste do Brasil, poucos estudos têm enfatizado a quantificação do meroplâncton 

de ambientes pelágicos no entorno de recifes costeiros. Alguns registros desses organismos são 

encontrados em estudos desenvolvidos nos recifes de Tamandaré (PE) que abordaram: a análise 

do zooplâncton demersal dos recifes (Silva, 2003; Melo et al., 2010), a influência dos estuários 

nos ambientes costeiros ao entorno dos recifes (Porto Neto, 2003; Nascimento-Vieira et al., 

2010), a composição do séston da baía de Tamandaré (Silva, 2016) e a distribuição espaço-

temporal de larvas de peixes (Silva-Falcão et al., 2012). O estudo da biomassa sestônica e da 

estrutura da comunidade zooplanctônica dos recifes de Maracajaú (RN) também revelaram a 

importância do meroplâncton nesses ecossistemas (Mayal et al., 2009). Todavia, as estratégias 

de amostragem de zooplâncton utilizadas nos trabalhos anteriormente citados não são 

apropriadas para um estudo quantitativo do meroplâncton produzido pelos recifes. 

Nos bancos dos Abrolhos (BA), Koettker e Lopes (2013) descreveram uma comunidade 

abundante e diversa de larvas de invertebrados no ambiente pelágico sobre e no entorno dos 

recifes, com ênfase em larvas de decápodes braquiúros de espécies residentes dos recifes. 

Entretanto, pouco se sabe sobre o potencial dos recifes como ecossistemas produtores de ovos 

e larvas em momentos de desova de peixes e invertebrados bentônicos, bem como a importância 

desses eventos no aporte de biomassa para os ambientes pelágicos.    

Quantificar, de forma precisa, a presença de larvas e ovos de peixes e invertebrados 

bentônicos em ambientes recifais é um grande desafio. A maioria dos organismos bentônicos e 

pelágicos residentes desses ecossistemas liberam larvas e ovos durante a noite (Forward, 1987; 



21 
 

Samoilys, 1997; Nanami et al., 2013), preferencialmente em dias de lua nova (Forward, 1987; 

Nolan e Danilowicz, 2008), o que torna a navegação próxima aos recifes, bem como a 

manipulação de redes tradicionais de coleta de zooplâncton, um trabalho perigoso.  

Outro problema é a hora exata e duração dos momentos desova, que varia para cada 

espécie (Forward, 1987), visto que uma amostragem realizada em um horário “inadequado” 

poderia subestimar a verdadeira contribuição do meroplâncton recifal para os ambientes 

pelágicos ao entorno dos recifes. A falta de conhecimento sobre padrões de correntes, dispersão, 

mecanismos de retenção e distribuição em manchas de larvas nesses ambientes também 

dificultam uma quantificação confiável do meroplâncton. 

Métodos tradicionais de coleta de zooplâncton também podem subestimar a 

quantificação da produção do meroplâncton de origem recifal nos ambientes pelágicos de águas 

rasas, umas vez que as malhas e design de redes comumente usadas em estudos realizadas 

nesses ecossistemas são mais apropriadas para a captura de organismos com pouca mobilidade, 

como é o caso de bombas de sucção usadas na coleta de zooplâncton em recifes (Heidelberg et 

al., 2004; Holzman et al., 2005; Heidelberg et al., 2010). Outros métodos de coleta usados 

nesses ecossistemas são mais adaptados para a captura de pós-larvas de decápodes e peixes, 

que é o caso das channel nets (Shenker et al., 1993; Thorrold et al., 1994; Doherty e Mcilwain, 

1996; Nolan e Danilowicz, 2008; Criales et al., 2010) e das armadilhas luminosas (Brogan, 

1994; Hickford e Schiel, 1999; Chan et al., 2016). 

Outra dificuldade metodológica para o estudo do zooplâncton dos ecossistemas recifais 

tropicais está relacionada às estimativas precisas da biomassa dos organismos através de 

métodos não destrutivos de amostras. O método do peso úmido do plâncton vem sendo utilizado 

como uma alternativa para o estudo da biomassa do séston marinho (Wiebe et al., 1975; Postel 

et al., 2000; Pitois e Fox, 2006; Melo Júnior et al., 2007; Silva, 2016). Entretanto, não é 

possível, através desse método, estimar de forma precisa, a biomassa dos grandes grupos do 

zooplâncton. Devido à forte correlação existente entre o tamanho e a biomassa dos organismos 

marinhos, é possível obter fatores de conversão confiáveis para o cálculo do peso seco, massa 

de carbono e nitrogênio do zooplâncton baseados em medições do comprimento dos organismos 

obtidas com o uso de ocular micrométrica em estereomicroscópios (Uye, 1982).  

Todavia, essas medições demandam um grande tempo de análise em laboratório. Por 

isso, muitos equipamentos ópticos e softwares têm sido desenvolvidos para a obtenção de dados 



22 
 

de tamanho do zooplâncton, in situ e em laboratório, de uma forma mais rápida e automatizada. 

Alguns exemplos desses equipamentos são o UVP (Underwater Vision Profile), o LOPC 

(Laser-Optical Plankton Counter), o Coulter Counter, a FlowCam e o ZooScan (Sheldon et al., 

1972; Grosjean et al., 2004; Schultes e Lopes, 2009; Gorsky, G. et al., 2010; Forest et al., 2012; 

Álvarez et al., 2014). 

Nesse contexto, alguns estudos têm enfatizado a elaboração de fórmulas para calcular a 

biomassa do zooplâncton a partir de dados de área corpórea e biovolume dos organismos 

obtidos por análises de imagens medidas com ocular micrométrica (Alcaraz et al., 2003; 

Hernández-León e Montero, 2006; Lehette e Hernández-León, 2009). Entretanto, os fatores de 

conversão disponíveis na literatura, até o presente momento, foram elaborados em ambientes 

antárticos e subtropicais. Logo, o uso dessas fórmulas pode ser inapropriado para as estimativas 

de biomassa do zooplâncton de origem tropical.   

A área escolhida para a realização dessa tese foi o complexo recifal de Tamandaré, 

localizado dentro dos limites da Área de Proteção Ambiental Costa dos Corais (ICMbio - 

Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação e Biodiversidade - 

http://www.icmbio.gov.br/apacostadoscorais), no município de Tamandaré, litoral sul do 

estado de Pernambuco (8º 45’36” e 8º 47’20” S e 35º 03’45” e 35º 06’45” W). Esses recifes são 

caracterizados pela baixa cobertura de corais escleractíneos e alta cobertura de macroalgas e 

zoantídeos (Costa, 2013; Santos et al., 2015). Representam um habitat importante para o 

desenvolvimento de várias espécies de peixes que realizam migrações de estuários para regiões 

da plataforma continental adjacente (Silva-Falcão et al., 2012; Aschenbrenner et al., 2016). 

Esses ambientes são considerados uma fonte importante de sustento para várias famílias que 

vivem no município de Tamandaré e realizam atividades relacionadas à pesca e ao turismo 

(Ferreira e Maida, 2001). Apesar da sua proximidade com a região costeira, as águas que 

banham os recifes de Tamandaré não estão em processos de eutrofização (Silva, 2015). 

Diferente dos recifes de corais localizados em regiões tropicais oligotróficas do Caribe 

e Indo-Pacífico, os recifes de águas rasas de ambientes costeiros do Nordeste do Brasil recebem 

uma grande influência de regiões estuarinas, o que aumenta consideravelmente a turbidez das 

águas que banham esses recifes (Silva et al., 2013). Esse fator é uma das principais razões pelas 

quais os recifes da costa brasileira apresentem uma alta cobertura de macroalgas e uma baixa 

cobertura de corais escleractíneos (Leão e Dominguez, 2000; Leão e Kikuchi, 2005). 

http://www.icmbio.gov.br/apacostadoscorais


23 
 

Provavelmente, esses recifes apresentam uma produção alta de organismos planctônicos que 

estão sob uma menor pressão predatória, quando comparados às assembleias zoooplanctônicas 

que habitam recifes com uma cobertura alta de corais escleractíneos. 

Para testar uma das hipóteses propostas na presente tese foram incialmente 

desenvolvidos dois capítulos voltados à metodologia de coleta e análise da biomassa do 

zooplâncton tropical. O primeiro capítulo teve como objetivo principal apresentar dois métodos 

novos apropriados para a amostragem de zooplâncton em pontos fixos próximos aos recifes, 

visando uma quantificação precisa de larvas e ovos, recém eclodidos, de peixes e invertebrados. 

O segundo capítulo teve o objetivo de apresentar fatores de conversão para o cálculo da 

biomassa do zooplâncton de regiões tropicais e comparar as fórmulas propostas no presente 

estudo com as fórmulas da literatura. O terceiro e último capítulo teve o objetivo de investigar 

se os recifes de Tamandaré podem ser considerados sumidouros ou fontes de zooplâncton para 

o ambiente pelágico, bem como destacar qual o grupo do mesozooplâncton mais relevante para 

o aporte de biomassa para os ambientes pelágicos. 

Pela primeira vez no Brasil é realizada uma coleta de zooplâncton com o uso de redes 

estacionárias durante o período noturno, em pontos fixos próximos aos recifes, em potencial 

momentos de desova de invertebrados bentônicos e peixes. O principal objetivo é avaliar a real 

contribuição e o papel de ambientes recifais tropicais, de uma área protegida marinha, no aporte 

de meroplâncton para os sistemas pelágicos. Também é relevante, no presente trabalho, a 

investigação das assembleias de zooplâncton de uma área recifal completamente fechada ao 

uso, onde são proibidas práticas como a pesca e o pisoteio. Vale salientar que também é 

executado, pela primeira vez, um estudo comparativo da análise de imagens de zooplâncton 

com o uso do ZooScan e da composição elementar (porcentagem de carbono e nitrogênio) 

desses organismos, em um ambiente tropical costeiro, que culminará na elaboração de fórmulas 

para calcular, de forma mais precisa, a biomassa do zooplâncton de uma região tipicamente 

tropical.

origem recifal;

4 TWO NEW METHODS FOR SAMPLING ZOOPLANKTON AND LARVAL 

ASSEMBLAGES IN TROPICAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS 

 

Abstract 

Sampling mobile zooplankton on reefs is a major challenge, mainly due to the problems faced 

when towing plankton nets inside complex reef mosaics. This study presents two new systems 

that permit precise point sampling of micro- and mesozooplankton and larvae of invertebrates 

and fish: the Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN) and the Reef Edge Net (REN). Both are 

moored systems that are equipped with 64- and 300-micron mesh nets. The CMNN system was 

designed for continuous sampling in tidal channels between reef patches. It samples at three 

precise depth layers (epineuston: 0 m to 0.075 m, hyponeuston: 0.075 m to 0.0225 m, 1 m layer:  

0.925 m to 1.075 m depth). The REN system allows sampling at precise, adjustable depths at 

given distances from the reef edge. The objective of the REN is to collect organisms that are 

washed from reef tops and reef edges with the ebb flow. The performance of these two new 

systems was evaluated and compared with results obtained by using common Ring nets in 

horizontal subsurface tows. Fieldwork was performed at two reef patches of the Tamandaré reef 

system (Brazil) in November 2015. The CMNN and REN showed similar performance in 

comparison with Ring net tows, capturing microzooplankton communities as well as veliger, 

polychaete, decapod and barnacle larvae in similar abundances. For the mesozooplankton, the 

REN presented a similar performance to the Ring net tows, efficiently capturing decapod 

crustacean and fish larvae as well as fish eggs. The CMNN showed lower abundance of decapod 

larvae and fish eggs but showed a good performance for the quantification of fish larvae. The 

two new passive nets showed a high effectiveness in collecting larvae and advantages over tows 



26 
 

with Ring nets since they stay for several hours continuously capturing larval aggregations 

during spawning events. This high capturing efficiency is probably related to the avoidance of 

sample reflux in the long nets that sink and close at slack tide for the CMNN, and due to the 

long, trap-like design with funnel-shaped internal “anti-reflux” nets, for the REN. Navigation 

safety and easy handling are further advantages of these moored systems, as compared to 

towing plankton nets at nighttime between reefs. CMNN and REN may become useful tools 

for the study of zooplankton and larval ecology and for integrated long-term studies in marine 

protected areas and reefs under multiple human impacts. 

 

Key words: Channel Midwater Neuston Net - Reef Edge Net - passive net systems - 

meroplankton - ichthyoplankton - larval production  

 

4.1 INTRODUCTION 

Tropical reefs harbor diverse communities of benthic and pelagic organisms. Larval 

dispersal plays a key role in population dynamics and connectivity in these ecosystems (Oliver 

et al., 1992; Sheppard et al., 2009; D’Agostini et al., 2015; Kough and Paris, 2015). In shallow 

tropical reefs, spawning events have been recorded mainly during nocturnal ebb tides 

(Samoilys, 1997; Francini et al., 2002). Several species of fish and invertebrates have shown 

this behavior as a strategy to increase the chances of survival. Furthermore, many fish and 

invertebrates spawn during new moon periods (Babcock, 1984; Williams et al., 1984; Francini 

et al., 2002; Padilla-Gamiño et al., 2011) to hinder the visualization of larvae by planktivores 

and other predators (Nolan and Danilowicz, 2008). 

To design an appropriate sampling strategy for surveys of larval production and dispersal 

is a considerable challenge. In tropical regions, several species spawn during the dry season, 

when temperature is higher and winds, currents and turbidity are fainter. Clearly, temperature 

and primary production have an influence on spawning and meroplankton (larvae and eggs) 

abundance in coastal waters (Williams et al., 1984; Anger, 2001; Mwaluma et al., 2011; 

Fernandes et al., 2012; Ziadi et al., 2015). 

Many studies recorded that spawning events in nearshore ecosystems have occurred at night 

(Jokiel et al., 1985; Forward, 1987; Francini et al., 2002; Nanami et al., 2013). However, it is a 

challenge to identify the right time to capture newly hatched larvae, and thus to design 

appropriately timed sampling strategies. Standard plankton net tows have been extensively used 



27 
 

to study zooplankton communities and larval abundance (Harding, 2001; Castro et al., 2005; 

Hernandez Jr et al., 2011; Mwaluma et al., 2011; Fernandes et al., 2012; Koettker and Lopes, 

2013; Ziadi et al., 2015; MacTavish et al., 2016). However, tows at given times of the night 

may underestimate the larval production if they are not conducted exactly during specific 

spawning events. Plankton patchiness is another serious concern for the assessment of larval 

abundance (Omori and Hamner, 1982; White et al., 2014).  

Several plankton trap and pump systems have been developed to obtain new insights into reef 

plankton, such as the horizontal in situ plankton pump sampler (Rützler et al., 1980), several 

types of  light traps (Brogan, 1994; Hickford and Schiel, 1999), cone-shaped plankton traps to 

collect organisms on reef tops (Porter and Porter, 1977; Ohlhorst, 1982; Yahel and Yahel, 2005; 

Melo et al., 2010) and zooplankton pump samplers (Heidelberg et al., 2004; Holzman et al., 

2005; Yahel and Yahel, 2005; Heidelberg et al., 2010).  

However, it is still a considerable challenge to study the production of larvae during 

spawning and hatching events. Pump samplers are unable to collect vagile organisms due to 

their escape behavior. The destruction of fragile organisms in pumps is a further serious 

drawback. Light traps are not quantitative, and their efficiency depends on moon regime, 

turbidity, the animal’s sensory capacity, behavioral response and swimming speed, etc. 

(Hickford and Schiel, 1999). Common channel nets (mesh size: 1 to 3 mm) are, such as light 

traps (Shenker et al., 1993; Thorrold et al., 1994; Criales et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2016) and 

crestnets (Doherty and Mcllwain, 1996; Nolan and Danilowicz, 2008) mainly designed for the 

capture of large pre-settlement stages of fish and shrimp, and are not useful for the study of 

spawning events and larval production. Thus, in spite of the vast literature on this subject, there 

is still a lack of appropriate methods that are specifically designed to collect newly hatched 

larvae of invertebrates and fish. 

The design of the two new systems described in the present study was based on several 

requirements to accurately quantify nocturnal larval release on reefs.   

There are several issues in quantitatively sampling larvae and zooplankton on shallow 

reefs: (I) Spawning occurs at discrete, often very narrow time spans, which are hard to predict, 

with a high risk of missing these peak events in standard plankton tows. (II) Towing plankton 

nets in between reef patches is often dangerous and in some situations simply impossible, even 

with a very small boat. This is especially critical in nighttime sampling and under rough weather 



28 
 

conditions and new moon, when reefs may not be well perceived during navigation in complete 

darkness. (III) Tows will always have to be conducted at a safe distance from the reef edge, 

thus the association of the samples with the reefs is weak, if any. (IV) Tows cover large 

stretches, and thus cannot be associated to a specific sampling point or to a specific reef patch.  

The aim of this study was: (I) to characterize and evaluate the performance of two new 

passive net systems in shallow coastal reef areas; (II) to integrate data obtained with the two 

new passive nets and standard plankton net tows for sampling micro- and mesozooplankton (64 

and 300 µm mesh sizes, respectively), with emphasis on larvae of fish and invertebrates; (III) 

to describe and test two new tools for sampling zooplankton and improve our ability to detect, 

quantify and understand the dynamics of larval production in reef ecosystems. 

 

4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

4.2.1 Description of the two new passive net systems 

Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN) – A lightweight mini-catamaran equipped 

with six rectangular-conical plankton nets attached to two floating tubes (two PVC tubes with 

2.15 m length and 100 mm diameter). Three depth layers are sampled: 1.) Epineuston: air-water 

interface, 0 m to 0.075 m, 2.) Hyponeuston: 0.075 m to 0,0225 m, 3.) 1 m layer: 0.925 to 1.075 

m (Fig. 1). Each depth layer of the CMNN contains two nets with different mesh sizes: 64 µm 

mesh for microzooplankton (mouth area: 15 cm x 15 cm, i.e., 0.022 m2, length: 1.5 m) and 300 

µm mesh for meso-, macrozooplankton and fish larvae (mouth area: 30 cm x 15 cm, i.e., 0.045 

m2, length: 2.5 m). The 300 µm mesh nets of the hyponeuston and 1 m layers were equipped 

with calibrated flowmeters (Hydro-Bios, Kiel, Germany) to measure filtered volume. The 

CMNN was designed to stay for several hours at a fixed station and sample during maximum 

ebb flow in tidal channels between reefs patches. The whole system is allowed to move freely 

according to the main current flow (Fig. 1). 

Reef Edge Net (REN) – A lightweight moored system composed of two slim, long, 

double-conical plankton nets, each net being equipped with an internal “anti-reflux net”. It 

contains a 64 µm mesh net for microzooplankton (mouth area: 15 cm x 15 cm, i.e., 0.022 m2) 

and a 300 µm mesh net for meso- and macrozooplankton and ichthyoplankton (mouth area: 30 

cm x 15 cm, i.e., 0.045 m2). Both nets have a length of 2 m (Fig. 1). The nets have an internal 

layer of the same mesh, an “anti-reflux net”, designed to hold back the return of vagile 



29 
 

organisms. The length of the inner anti-reflux net is 1.35 m, with an internal opening diameter 

of 8 cm, being considerably narrower than the opening diameter (11 cm) of the external net  

towards the net bucket (Fig. 2). The internal net is hold permanently stretched and open by two 

straps at the distant end (Fig. 2). At the front of the collector bucket of the 64 µm net, a sieve 

(1 mm mesh size) was loosely attached to prevent the entrance of large predators. The REN was 

firmly moored with two weights (20 kg of concrete at the front and 3 kg lead at the cod end) 

and maintained stretched out with a slim PVC tube that was placed alongside the net between 

the cod end and the mouth (Fig. 2). Two floats (5 and 0.5 liters buoyancy) kept the net in a fixed 

position in the water column. Ropes were adjusted as to have the net mouth exactly aligned 

with the upper reef edge and as to have the whole system always completely submerged. The 

300 µm mesh net was equipped with a Hydro-Bios (Kiel, Germany) calibrated flowmeter to 

measure filtered volume. The REN was designed to stay for several hours at a fixed station, 

thus sampling as close as possible to the reef edge during maximum ebb flow. The central 

objective of the REN is to collect organisms that are washed from the reef tops and reef edge 

with the ebb flow. It was designed to be as lightweight and small as possible, to be deployed 

manually and handled and transported in any small boat. Diving or snorkeling may be necessary 

for fine adjustments of the ropes that define position and depth of the REN, at least during the 

first use at a given location.

4.2.2 Case study: Tamandaré reefs 

The new sampling systems were tested in the Tamandaré reefs, Brazil (Fig. 3). This reef 

complex is part of the “Costa dos Corais” Marine Protected Area (Pernambuco State, Brazil). 

This MPA was created to preserve the biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources on 

shallow coastal reefs. In April 1999, through a federal decree, a reef patch known as "Ilha da 

Barra" and its surrounding waters were permanently closed to any fishing and visiting (Fig. 3). 

Two sampling areas were chosen for this study: “Ilha da Barra” (closed area) and 

“Pirambu” (open-access area, with moderate fishing and visiting). In each area, two fixed 

stations were determined for the mooring of CMNN and REN systems: one station in a tidal 

channel (for the CMNN) and one station at the downstream side (at ebb tide) of the reef patch 

(for the REN).  

Sampling was carried out during three consecutive nights, from November 10 to 12, 

2015 (new moon). Tidal amplitude was 1.9 m. CMNN and REN systems were deployed during 

high tide, in the afternoon (3:00 pm to 4:50 pm) and recovered after approximately four and 

half hours (at low tide, during the night).

Average water temperature and salinity ranged from 28.4°C to 29.0ºC and from 35.3 to 

36.3, respectively, measured at the beginning and at the end of each sampling with a YSI 

CastAway CTD (SonTek, San Diego, CA, USA). Maximum current speed during new moon 

spring tides at the Ilha da Barra tidal channel (depth: 7 to 9 m according to the tides) varied 

from 3 to 5.8 cm s-1, measured in March and October 2015, 1.5 m above the bottom with a S4 

current meter (InterOcean Systems LLC, San Diego, CA, USA). 

At the sandy bottom adjacent to the reef edges, where the RENs were deployed, local 

depth was 4 to 5 m at high tide. Sampling depths of the two RENs (at Ilha da Barra and Pirambú 

reefs) were adjusted by divers as to be aligned with the upper edge of each reef. RENs thus 

stayed 2.2 m and 1.9 m above the bottom at Ilha da Barra and at Pirambu, respectively and 

stayed approximately 5 m distant from the reefs (Fig. 4). This resulted in an effective sampling 

depth of approximately 2.2 to 2.7 m (during deployment at high tide) to 0.5 to 1.4 m at the end 

of the sampling (at retrieval during low tide). 

At the tidal channels where the two CMNNs were deployed, local depth was 8.1 to 9.8 

m during high tide (Fig. 4). The three sampling depth layers of the CMNNs (center of each net) 

were constant at 0.0375 m, 0.1875 m and 1 m.  

Additionally to deploying REN and CMNN systems (Fig. 5), horizontal subsurface tows 

were conducted with two standard conical-cylindrical Ring nets (64 and 300 µm mesh nets, 

with 0.3 m and 0.6 m diameters, i.e., 0.07 and 0.282 m2 mouth area, respectively). These tows 

were performed at 1.5 to 2 knots between both stations during nocturnal ebb tide in each area, 

covering the distance between both fixed stations (Fig. 3). Mean sampling depth of the Ring 

nets was 0.15 m for the 64 µm mesh (0.3 m diameter, 1 m length) and 0.3 m for the 300 µm 

mesh (0.6 m diameter, 2.5 m length). Ring net tows were conducted immediately after sunset 

for thirteen minutes, starting at the CMNN station towards the REN station (towing against the 

ebb current flow).

All 20 nets (2 x 6 CMNN, 2 x 2 REN, and 2 x 2 Ring nets) sampled simultaneously 

during each night. 

In the 64 and 300 µm mesh sizes of the 1 m depth layer of the CMNN, filtered volume 

ranged from 8.03 to 20.85 m3 and from 16.07 to 41.71 m3, respectively. In the REN, filtered 

volume ranged from 3.07 to 7.78 and from 6.15 to 15.56 m3 for 64 and 300 µm mesh nets, 

respectively. Ring net tows yielded larger filtered volumes, from 12.09 to 31.92 m3 for the 64 

µm mesh and from 48.39 to 127.68 m3 for the 300 µm mesh nets. 

An unexpected influence of strong winds on the epineuston and hyponeuston nets 

(CMNN) was observed at both channel stations. This happened when the wind direction was 

against the surface current flows. Hence, an entanglement of the 64 µm nets of the two upper 

(epineuston and hyponeuston) layers occurred occasionally, as could be observed in low 

flowmeter rotations. Therefore, only relative abundance composition and length frequency 



34 
 

distribution data of the micro- and mesozooplankton from epineuston and hyponeuston nets 

were presented in this study. 

All samples were preserved in 4% formaldehyde buffered with 0.05% sodium 

tetraborate (final concentrations in seawater). Any large organisms trapped on the 1 mm sieve 

of the 64 µm REN were preserved separately. In this study, 60 samples (30 for each mesh size) 

were analyzed (three nights x 20 nets). 

 

4.2.3 Laboratory methods 

Seston biomass (mg.m-3) was measured as wet weight (Wiebe et al., 1975). First, 

samples were accumulated on sieves (20 and 200 µm sieves for 64 and 300 µm mesh samples, 

respectively). Then, sieves were placed on absorbant paper towels to remove excess water 

before weighing on a balance with 0.01 g precision. Microzooplankton samples (64 µm mesh) 

were analyzed under a Zeiss Axiostar plus binocular microscope, using a Sedgewick-Rafter 

counting chamber. Aliquots of 1 ml were taken from a diluted microzooplankton sample 

(varying from 1 to 1000 ml, depending on total abundance). 

These subsamples were used to count, measure and identify 100 to 300 organisms per 

sample. Thirty individuals per sample were measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer. The 

300 µm mesh samples (mesozooplankton and ichthyoplankton) were scanned at 2400 dpi 

resolution using a ZooScan equipment (Hydroptic, France). Two size fractions (&gt;1 mm and&amp;lt;1 

mm) were thus scanned for each sample. Aliquots were splitted with a Motoda splitter (Motoda, 

1959) to obtain 1000 to 1500 objects per scan. Objects were manually separated for 20 minutes 

prior to scanning.

After scanning and image processing (with the ZooProcess software), each image was 

converted, processed and had its vignettes (small images of each object) extracted and loaded 

into the Plankton Identifier software (Gorsky et al., 2010). All objects were measured prior to 

semi-automated classification of vignettes, based on the Random Forest algorithm, followed by 

manual identification and validation by an experienced zooplankton taxonomist (Grosjean et 

al., 2004; Gorsky et al., 2010). 

 

4.2.4 Data Analysis 

To test possible differences in seston biomass (mg.m-3), organism abundance (ind.m-3) 

and size distribution among the sampling systems, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used with 

Mann-Whitney tests for post-hoc comparisons at ? = 0.05 (Zar, 1996). The relative frequencies 

of specific size classes were compared between gears (i.e., percentage of organisms &amp;lt;2 mm 

and &gt; 2 mm for the 64 µm samples and percentage of organisms &amp;lt;3 mm and &gt; 3 mm for 300 



36 
 

µm samples) using Mann-Whitney tests at ? = 0.05. Meroplankton / holoplankton abundance 

ratios were also tested between gears using Mann-Whitney tests at ? = 0.05 (Zar, 1996). 

 

4.3 RESULTS 

4.3.1 Quantification of spawning and hatching events on reefs  

The new sampling systems proved to be very useful for the study of spawning events 

on reefs. For instance, very large amounts of fish eggs where sampled in the 300 µm mesh net 

(7.35 ± 8.3 ind. m-3 and 19.8 ± 35.49 ind. m-3 for CMNN and REN, respectively). Larvae of 

reef macroinvertebrates were also very abundant in these samples, for example, zoea-stage 

larvae of brachyuran crabs (1.66 ± 1.39 ind. m-3 and 7.43 ± 5.91 ind. m-3 for CMNN and REN, 

respectively) and larvae of other decapods (2.78 ± 2.5 ind. m-3 and 9.56 ± 8.38 ind. m-3 for 

CMNN and REN, respectively), mainly larvae of caridean shrimps, hermit crabs and lobsters. 

Larvae of reef fishes were even more abundant than decapods (1.1 ± 1.18 ind. m-3 and 10.96 ± 

11.26 ind. m-3 for CMNN and REN, respectively). Among these fish larvae, recently hatched 

early stages (preflexion) were clearly dominant, while among decapod larvae, early zoea-stage 

larvae were dominant, indicating the capture of freshly hatched larval communities that were 

directly obtained from the reefs.   

  

4.3.2 Comparing sample composition between gears  

The new net systems and the towed Ring nets yielded highly diverse communities of 

reef plankton organisms. Overall, nineteen groups were identified in the 64 µm samples and 

twenty-one in the 300 µm samples (Table 1). Copepods (nauplii and adults) were the most 

abundant group in all sampling systems and in both mesh sizes (Table 1 and Fig. 6). 

In the microzooplankton (64 µm), copepod nauplii dominated by abundance in all gears.  

Furthermore, foraminiferans and appendicularians were also very abundant in 

microzooplankton samples (Table 1 and Fig. 6). Composition and density of the 

microzooplankton community was very similar between gears, indicating a similarly efficient 

capture for these organisms, in spite of much lower net current speeds for passive systems than 

for towed nets. 

In contrast to the microzooplankton, the large organisms caught in 300 µm samples 

displayed considerable differences in composition and density between gears. In the 300 µm 



37 
 

samples, fish eggs were the second most important group (after copepods), representing on 

average 16.2% abundance in the epineuston and 1 m layer (CMNN) and in REN samples. 

Decapods were the second most abundant group in the 300 µm Ring net samples, representing 

on average 22.6% of the total abundance (Table 1 and Fig. 6).  

Additionally to the small early-stage larvae and copepods, many groups of organisms 

larger than 3 cm were effectively quantified in this study, such as polychaetes, isopods of the 

genus Excorallana spp., juveniles of the penaeid shrimp Rimapenaeus spp., unidentified 

juveniles of Penaeidae, megalopae and juveniles of portunid crabs and puerulus-stage lobsters 

of the genus Palinurus spp. 

 

4.3.3 Comparing size structure between gears  

The length-frequency distribution of the organisms captured by the different sampling 

systems showed very similar patterns, with higher abundances in smaller size classes followed 

by a rapid decrease in abundance towards larger animals. The organisms captured in 64 µm nets 

ranged from 0.07 to 3.6 mm, and 95% of them were in the 0.01 to 2 mm size range in all gears. 

Organisms captured by 300 µm mesh nets ranged from 0.42 to 67.4 mm, and 72% were in the 

0.01 to 2 mm size range for all gears tested (Fig. 7). The relative contribution of the organisms 

captured in 64 µm nets with &amp;lt;2 mm and &gt; 2 mm did not show differences between gears. 

However, the samples obtained with the 300 µm mesh Ring net tows presented a significantly 

higher contribution of large organisms (&gt; 3 mm) when compared to the passive nets (Mann-

Whitney tests, p&lt;0.001). 

 

4.3.4 Comparing seston biomass and abundance between gears 

The seston biomass and total abundance of the microzooplankton community did not 

show differences among the CMNN, REN and towed Ring nets (Table 2; Fig. 8), in spite of 

much lower current speeds for passive systems than for towed nets. Similarly, abundances of 

veliger larvae, polychaetes, decapods (i.e., caridean early-stage zoea larvae), brachyuran larvae 

(zoeae and megalopae) and cirripede nauplii did not show significant differences amo ng the 

nets, for the microzooplankton.

However, seston biomass and abundance of the mesozooplankton were markedly lower 

in the passive nets than in the Ring net, but no significant differences were found between 

CMNN and REN (Table 2 and 3; Fig. 8). The abundance of decapods, i.e., larvae of caridean 

shrimps (zoea I), early phyllosoma-stage larvae of Palunirus (stage I), porcellanid crabs and 

unidentified decapods, brachyurans (zoeae and megalopae) and fish eggs did not show any 

significant differences between the two new systems, but presented differences between CMNN 

and Ring nets, except for early stage (preflexion) fish larvae, that were captured in similar 



39 
 

densities in CMMN and Ring nets (Table 2 and 3; Fig. 9). No differences were observed 

between REN and Ring nets in all four groups analysed (Table 2 and 3; Fig. 9), in spite of very 

low effective current speeds for the REN.

For the 64 µm mesh nets, the meroplankton : holoplankton ratio in CMNN (1 m layer), 

REN and Ring nets were always less than 1 (mean: 0.03, 0.05 and 0.03, respectively), indicating 

a dominance of holoplankton (i.e., copepods) in the microzooplankton. Conversely, for the 300 

µm mesh nets, meroplankton : holoplankton ratios included values above 1 (mean: 0.62, 1.12 

and 1.2, respectively). Thus, for 300 µm mesh REN and Ring nets, holoplankters (e.g. 

copepods) were less abundant than larvae (Fig. 10). No differences in meroplankton / 

holoplankton ratios were recorded between gears, for both mesh sizes, indicating that the new 

systems and standard nets sample similar communities.

4.4 DISCUSSION 

This study presents two new systems that were designed to quantify zooplankton and 

larval production during spawning events on shallow reefs. Even under the weak tidal current 

regime of the study area, the passive systems presented in this study (CMNN and REN) showed 

to be clearly suitable for investigations that require punctual and accurate sampling, thus 

opening new perspectives for research on tropical reefs. 

The high density of early life history stages of invertebrates, fish larvae and fish eggs in 

the passive nets indicates freshly released organisms (Forward, 1987; Nanami et al., 2013) and 

shows the usefulness of the two new systems for sampling larval assemblages at shallow reef 

ecosystems during spawning and hatching events. 

The Channel Midwater Neuston Net and the Reef Edge Net showed a high efficiency in 

sampling holoplankton and meroplankton (larvae and eggs), similarly to the results of Rützler 

et al. (1980), who used a complex motor-driven horizontal net (HOPLASA) with 250 µm mesh 

size for 5 to 8 hours of sampling on the shallow tropical reefs of Belize. However, the target of 

the sampler of Rützler et al. (1980) was on small, less mobile larvae of invertebrates such as 

larval sponges, cnidarians and echinoderms, while this is the first study to present a method to 

capture highly vagile crustacean and fish larvae on reefs. 

The 64 µm nets showed the same microzooplankton capturing performance among the 

three sampling techniques used, with good agreement in seston biomass, total abundance and 

abundance of larvae. 

The new passive net systems yielded a good representation of the composition of major 

groups of the micro- and mesozooplankton as compared to results obtained with towed Ring 

nets, in spite of much lower effective current speeds. This high capturing efficiency is probably 

due to the avoidance of sample reflux due the long nets that sink and close at slack tide for the 

CMNN, and to the long, trap-like design with funnel-shaped internal anti-reflux nets, for the 

REN.   

 

4.4.1 Filtered volume and sample size 

Several factors have been described in previous studies as having a strong influence on 

zooplankton sampling efficiency, such as net design, mouth diameter, mesh size, towing speed, 

plankton patchiness and sampling depth (Fleminger and Clutter, 1965; Cassie, 1968; Clutter 



46 
 

and Anraku, 1968; Tranter and Smith, 1968; Barkley, 1972; Cook and Hays, 2001; Holzman et 

al., 2005; Tseng et al., 2011; Skjoldal et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2016; Pitois et al., 2016). 

The most important factor to understand the differences in filtered volumes between 

passive and towed gears used in the present study are the weak currents at all fixed sampling 

stations. Ring net tows filtered a considerable volume of water, due to the constant and high 

speed during the hauls (1.5 to 2 knots) and their much larger mouth area (3 and 6 times larger 

than the mouth areas of the passive nets for the 64 and 300 µm meshes, respectively). Thus, the 

filtered volume recorded in the CMNN and REN was 4 and 8 times lower than in the Ring net 

tows, respectively.   

There is a sense that longer tows increase the chances of encountering patches of 

plankton (Cassie, 1968) and larval retention may be an important source of patches around reefs 

zones (Mwaluma et al., 2011). Large volumes of filtered water by plankton gears increase the 

chances to capture mobile as well as rare animals (Dixon and Robertson, 1986). This may 

partially explain the higher abundance in the 300 µm mesh Ring nets. The shape and size of 

samplers also have a strong influence on filtering performance and zooplankton avoidance 

(Fleminger and Clutter, 1965; Tranter and Smith, 1968). It is relevant to consider that the design 

of the mouth of the new passive nets and their apertures are three and six times smaller than the 

64 and 300 µm Ring nets, respectively. 

The filtered volume was much lower in the CMNN and REN than in the Ring nets, 

although the passive nets sampled for more than four hours (vs 13 minutes of towing for the 

Ring nets). The same patterns have also been observed in previous intercomparisons of various 

zooplankton trap net systems, which recorded the volume of water filtered, the zooplankton 

abundance as well as the abundance of specific mobile species inside the plankton trap systems. 

These parameters were much lower than those recorded in standard tows (Dixon and Robertson, 

1986; Cook and Hays, 2001; Pitois et al., 2016).   

Probably, the higher filtering efficiency of the Ring net tows and shallower sampling 

depth (compared to the 1 m layer of the CMNN and the deep REN) at least partially explains 

the higher total abundance in 300 µm mesh samples in the tows datasets compared to the results 

obtained by the passive nets described in the present study. In coastal areas, most zooplankton 

organisms and fish eggs tend to accumulate and disperse at the surface, especially during the 

night (Hardy et al., 1987; Yannicelli et al., 2006; Irisson and Lecchini, 2008), which would 



47 
 

explain higher densities and biomasses in subsurface Ring net tows as compared to REN 

samples and 1 m layer samples of 300 µm meshes. 

 

4.4.2 Gear avoidance  

Several groups of zooplankton have been described as active swimmers, showing 

response mechanisms to vibrational stimuli and hydrostatic pressure waves, which may 

influence their avoidance to any samplers (Fleminger and Clutter, 1965; Clutter and Anraku, 

1968). 

Towing speed has a huge influence on capture in two different ways: by extrusion, when 

smaller animals escape through the mesh or, by avoidance, when mobile species escape from 

the sampler. At high-speed tows, the pressure of the water filtered through the mesh is higher 

when compared to low-speed tows, which strongly influences the evasion of smaller plankton 

species through the sampler by extrusion. In contrast, larger animals with swimming 

mechanisms may increase their chances of escaping by avoidance in tows performed at lower 

speeds (Cook and Hays, 2001; Fleminger and Clutter, 1965). 

The effects of zooplankton escaping by extrusion and avoidance from samplers 

observed in previous intercomparasions (Dixon and Robertson, 1986; Pitois et al., 2016) have 

not influenced the size structure of the communities sampled by 64 µm nets in this study since 

the organisms collected by the three gears used in the current study showed a similar percentage 

of contribution by the size intervals approached. Conversely, for 300 µm mesh nets, higher gear 

avoidance against passive nets may explain the higher contribution of large organisms (&gt; 3 mm) 

to Ring net tow samples. 

The 64 µm mesh size of the 1 m layer of the CMNN, REN and the Ring net had the 

same capturing performance with no differences in total abundance of microzooplankton, 

veliger, Polychaeta, Decapoda and Cirripedia larvae, although the new passive net systems 

presented lower filtration efficiency compared to the Ring net. On the other hand, animals 

captured with the 300 µm nets presented higher total abundance in the Ring net samples when 

compared to the CMNN and REN samples. 

Pitois et al. (2016) described Decapoda as contributing 24% more to the Ring net 

samples than to the Continuous Semi-Automatic Sampler (CALPS) samples and the authors 

attributed their findings to the ability of Decapoda and other larger zooplankton groups to 



48 
 

escape from the CALPS. Dixon and Robertson (1986) recorded higher abundance of mobile 

animals such as chaetognaths, polychaetes and larvaceans in traditional towns compared to 

pump sampling systems. Holzman et al. (2005) also noted that the use of some traps in coral 

reef ecosystems such as pumps underestimate the abundance of large zooplankton, e.g. 

decapods and larvaceans due to the fact that those groups avoid capture using their swimming 

abilities. 

Similarly, the 300 µm nets at the 1 m layer (CMNN) presented lower abundances of  

decapod larvae and fish eggs, as compared to 300 µm Ring net samples. This is probably due 

to the difference in sampled depth (1 m vs subsurface). Eggs of innumerous coastal fish species 

have been known to accumulate close at surface (Hardy et al., 1987), as do many decapod larvae 

(Yannicelli et al., 2006). Additionally, the weak currents at CMNN stations may have facilitated 

sampler avoidance by agile decapods. Conversely, the 1 m layer of the CMNN recorded the 

same fish larvae abundance as the Ring net. It seems that nocturnal gear avoidance and sampling 

depth had no effects on fish larvae captured by the 1 m layer of the CMNN. 

The REN showed a much better performance for capturing decapod larvae and fish eggs, 

as compared to the CMNN. These differences may be related to the production of these 

organisms at the reefs, and that the REN sampled them right at their dispersal source. Decapod 

larvae and fish eggs are probably washed directly from the reefs and are then captured at the 

edge, indicating the existence of intense spawning activities of reef fish and high densities of 

decapods on these reefs. 

The two new methodologies described in the current study for sampling micro-, meso-  

and macrozooplankton, combined with standard tows, may be applied for further studies aiming 

at a more comprehensive picture of larval ecology in shallow tropical reefs. 

 

4.5 CONCLUSIONS 

The Channel Midwater Neuston Net and the Reef Edge Net provide a collection of 

robust scientific data with reliable representation of micro, meso-, and macrozooplankton, as 

well as fish eggs and fish and invertebrate larvae. The Reef Edge Net showed a better 

performance for the quantification of fish and invertebrate larvae, although it presented a lower 

filtered volume compared to the CMNN and Ring nets. It seems that the fixed depth and position 

in relation to the reefs during the sampling period are the main factors to explain the REN larvae 



49 
 

capture performance, together with the anti-reflux net inside the REN, which functions as a 

larval trap.  

The main advantage of using the new passive net systems described in the present study 

over Ring nets is that they stay longer in situ, capturing larval aggregations during spawning 

events. In addition, the safety of navigation and easy handling are big advantages of these 

moored systems, as compared to towing plankton nets at nighttime between the reefs.   

The integrated use of traditional plankton nets with novel passive gears may optimize larval 

monitoring and spawning records in integrated long-term studies in tropical coastal 

environments, emphasizing larval production, connectivity, trophic interactions, and the role of 

larval supply from marine protected areas to damaged reefs.

5 FROM IMAGES TO ELEMENTS: USING BODY DIMENSIONS TO INFER 

CARBON AND NITROGEN MASS IN TROPICAL COASTAL ZOOPLANKTON 

 
Abstract 

The biomass of zooplankton is one of the key parameters for any marine ecosystem models. 

However, there are only few non-destructive methods available to measure this biomass, and 

none of them is intended to coastal tropical marine zooplankton. This study proposes 

conversion factors to predict the biomass (i.e., dry weight, carbon and nitrogen mass) of 

tropical zooplankton based on the body size data of organisms obtained through semi-

automatic image analysis. Biomass estimates of the zooplankton from a coastal tropical area 

of Brazil are compared to previously published conversions for zooplankton from subtropical 

and Antarctic waters. Length (mm), equivalent spherical diameter (mm), body area (mm2) 

and ellipsoid biovolume (mm3) of zooplankton were significantly correlated with dry weight, 

carbon and nitrogen mass (p &amp;lt;0.001 for all correlations). Ellipsoid Biovolume showed the 

best correlation coefficients for all biomass measurements (r = 0.93, 0.96 and 0.96, 

respectively). Comparisons between tropical zooplankton biomass estimations using 

formulas proposed in the present study with other conversion factors showed significant 

differences (Mann-Whitney test, p &amp;lt;0.001) in dry weight, carbon and nitrogen 

measurements. Tropical zooplankton biomass was underestimated up to 54% and 

overestimated up to 254% using the conversion factors proposed in previous studies. The use 

of regression equation parameters suggested in the present study will help researches to 

prevent such errors in biomass estimations of pelagic organisms of coastal tropical areas, 

when using image analysis tools. 

Key words: zooplankton biomass, factor conversions, equivalent spherical diameter, body area, 

ellipsoid biovolume

5.1 INTRODUCTION 

The study of biomass is essential to understand key aspects of marine life such as 

growth, production, community structure, the efficiency of energy transfer through trophic 

levels, etc. (Rodriguez and Mullin 1986; Sprules and Munawar 1986; Zhou 2006; Andersen et 

al. 2016). Several analytical techniques have been used to measure dry weight, carbon and 

nitrogen mass for assessing zooplankton biomass (Omori 1969; Hopkins 1982; Schram and 

Schmitz 1983; Froneman 2001; Puelles et al. 2003; Yahel et al. 2005). However, these methods 

implicate in the complete destruction of organisms, thus hampering the use of samples for 

further taxonomic studies (Postel et al. 2000).  

Instead of that, analyses of wet mass have been used as a nondestructive method to 

estimate the total sestonic biomass of plankton samples, since there is a consistent linear 

relationship between dry and wet mass (Wiebe et al. 1975; Postel et al. 2000; Pitois and Fox 

2006; Kiørboe 2013). Nevertheless, a proper measurement of biomass of specific zooplankton 

major groups through this method is not achievable, and sestonic mass may contain large 

contributions of detritus. Other concern regarding to biomass measurements is that formalin-

fixed samples may have their zooplankton biomass underestimated as suggested by Alcaraz et 

al. (2003) due to organism biomasses loss after the formalin fixation of samples.   

Only few studies have yet suggested methods for measurements of zooplankton 

biomass through images analysis. For example, Alcaraz et al. (2003) studied the relationship 

between biovolume and carbon and nitrogen mass of zooplankton, through the analysis of 

images obtained under a stereomicroscope. They proposed allometric regression equations to 

estimate carbon and nitrogen mass of the bulk zooplankton, without considering the variability 

of organism body shapes and group-specific elemental composition. Lehette and Hernández-

León (2009) published compiled data of the relationships between dry mass and digitized body 

area of zooplankton (obtained by using stereomicroscope images) from subtropical and Antartic 

waters. Gorsky et al. (2010) recorded the relationship between ZooScan image metrics and 

elemental composition of zooplankton from the California Current, in an upwelling area, but 

the authors only provided conversion factors to assess the biomass (in carbon and nitrogen 

units) for three groups (copepods, euphausiids and chaetognats) from an upwelling ecosystem.  

There is still a large gap concerning biomass conversion factors, mainly in relation to 

body size vs carbon and nitrogen contents of group-specific zooplankton data for tropical areas. 



52 
 

Information on elemental composition of zooplankton of tropical waters is limited to Beers 

(1966) and Ikeda and Mckinnon (2012), who studied organisms from the Sargasso Sea and the 

Great Barrier Reef, respectively, but the relationship between carbon and nitrogen mass and 

body size was not in the scope of these studies.  

The current use of current conversion factors that were intended to estimation of 

biomass of zooplankton from subtropical and Antarctic environments can increase the error in 

biomass measurements of planktonic groups from tropical areas, given the high variability of 

body size of pelagic organisms around the world (Acevedo-Trejos et al. 2015; Brun et al. 2017). 

Thus, the elaboration of specific conversion factors to estimate biomass of zooplankton from 

tropical waters, through image analyses, may help researches to provide more reliable biomass 

measurements of specific-groups of pelagic organisms from these regions.     

This study addresses four main objectives: i) to provide carbon and nitrogen contents, 

and dry mass data of zooplankton major groups from tropical coastal waters of northeastern 

Brazil; ii) to compare the percentage of carbon and nitrogen in the dry mass of the organisms 

in fresh and formaline- preserved samples; iii) to integrate dry, carbon and nitrogen mass to 

length, equivalent spherical diameter (ESD), body area and biovolume of the zooplankton and 

create reliable conversion factors to measure zooplankton biomass through image analyses; iv) 

to compare the conversion factors proposed in the present study with formulas published in the 

literature. The application of the regression equations proposed in this study as well as the 

comparison of these formulas with those published in the literature aim to contribute to a more 

precise assessment of zooplankton biomass of tropical regions, based on size measurements. 

 

5.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Field activities were carried out in two coastal areas: Bacia do Pina estuary 

(08°03’S; 34°52’W – Recife city) and in the reefs of Tamandaré (8°45’S; 35°06’W – 

Tamandaré city), both located in Northeastern Brazil. Samplings were performed from 

November 2016 to January 2017 (dry season) using standard ring nets with 200, 300 and 500 

µm mesh sizes, which were towed horizontally at subsurface (at 1.5 to 2 knots).  

Fresh samples were stored in 5L-bottles filled with ambient seawater at 6 to 10ºC for 

up to 12 hours to have the organisms immobilized (cold-shock) in order to obtain images. 

Each sample was splitted into two aliquots: the first one was used to analyze fresh organisms 



53 
 

(fresh samples) and the second to perform further analyses with organisms preserved in 

formalin at 4% final concentration (preserved samples). The acquisition of zooplankton 

images and the analytical procedures performed in this study (details explained hereafter) 

were carried out with fresh samples approximately 12 hours after the sampling. Fixed 

samples were analyzed after 2 months.  

Fresh and fixed zooplankton samples were sorted into two fractions: &amp;lt;0.5 mm and &gt; 

0.5 mm. All organisms were quickly washed with distilled water to remove detritus and 

phytoplankton on zooplankton body surface. In order to obtain group-specific relationships 

between body size and elemental composition of the zooplankton, the organisms were sorted 

into major groups (copepods, decapods, mysids, polychaets and fish larvae) under a 

stereomicroscope. After that, each group (varying from 1 to 294 organisms belonging to the 

same group) was scanned at 2400 dpi resolution, using a ZooScan (Hydroptic, France). The 

organisms of each scanning were then stored in tin capsules and dried at 60ºC for 24 hours. 

Each capsule was weighed in a microbalance and the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mass were 

measured by using a EuroVector elemental analyzer (model Euro EA 3000-Single).  

The percentage of carbon and nitrogen in the zooplankton dry mass (%) were 

transformed (log x+1) and normality and homoscedasticity were tested using Kolmogorov-

Smirnov and Bartlett tests, respectively. To compare the percentage of carbon and nitrogen 

contents in fresh and fixed organisms, Mann-Whitney tests were used. Only copepods (12 

and 10 capsules for fresh and fixed samples, respectively) and planktonic decapods (18 and 

10 capsules for fresh and fixed samples, respectively) were used for these comparisons.  

The images obtained with the ZooScan were analyzed in the Plankton Identifier 

(PkID) software (Gorsky et al. 2010). The length of organisms was measure based on the 

“major” metric that represents the largest linear axis of the particle in an image. The body 

area (mm2) of zooplankton was considered based on the “area excluded” metric, which 

represents the 2-D area of the particle (surface area) on the image, i.e., the sum of pixels of 

the scanned particle (Gorsky et al. 2010; Vandromme et al. 2012). The sum of pixels of an 

organism in an image, was converted to a sphere and the ESD was estimated as the diameter 

of this sphere. The ellipsoid biovolume (mm3) was calculated based on “major” and “minor” 

(major and minor axes of the particle) metrics, i.e., as Biovolume = 

4/3*?*(major/2)*(minor/2)2 (Vandromme et al. 2012).  



54 
 

Data of biomass (dry, carbon and nitrogen mass) and size (length, ESD, body area and 

biovolume) of the zooplankton were transformed into their natural logarithms and parameters 

of exponential regressions (y = a * xb) were obtained to calculate the linear regressions that 

correlate organisms biomass and size. The regressions were determined from Biomass (µg) 

= exp(a).Sizeb, where the a and b are the intercept and the slope of the regressions, 

respectively. The Biomass may be measure as dry, carbon or nitrogen mass (in µg) while the 

Size represents the length (mm), ESD (mm), body area (mm2) and biovolume (mm3) of the 

zooplankton.  

Five zooplankton groups were analyzed: mysids (n = 6), polychaetes (n = 5), 

copepods (n = 22), planktonic decapods (n = 28) and fish larvae (n = 13). Due to the fact that 

mysids and polychaetes were only sporadically captured in plankton samples, the n was 

insufficient to derive group-specific regression equations for these groups. Thus, data on 

these taxa were only included in the general regression equations for the whole zooplankton 

community.  

The conversion factors created in the present study to estimate biomass (dry, carbon 

and nitrogen mass) were compared, through Mann-Whitney tests, with biomass 

measurements performed with the formulas published by Uye (1982), Alcaraz et al. (2003) 

and Lehette and Hernández-León (2009) (Table 4), in order to access prospective errors in 

biomass measurements of tropical zooplankton using formulas generated with organisms of 

subtropical and Antarctic waters. The biases related to biomass measurements (in percentage) 

using the formulas created in this study and other from literature was estimated as bias = 

100*(this study – reference)/this study. All statistical analysis was performed by using 

Matlab R2017.b at a level of significance of 0.05 (Zar 1996). 

 

5.3 RESULTS 

The carbon and nitrogen contents of dry mass (%) of the zooplankton sampled in 

tropical waters of Northeastern of Brazil varied within a consistent, narrow range, from 39.1% 

to 47.58% and from 8.38% to 15.27%, respectively (Fig. 11 and Table 5). The copepods analyzed 

in the present study were mainly represented by Temora turbinata, Acartia lilligeborgii and 

Labidocera fluviatilis and the decapods by Belzebub faxoni, brachyuran larvae and other 

decapod larvae. The pairwise comparisons between fresh and fixed samples of copepods and 



55 
 

planktonic decapods did not show any significant differences in the percentage of carbon or 

nitrogen  contents of zooplankton dry mass (Mann-Whitney test, p &gt; 0.05), thus indicating 

that there was no significant carbon or nitrogen loss due to fixation. Thus, both fresh and 

fixed samples were used together to elaborate the conversion factors to estimate zooplankton 

biomass.  

Copepods showed the smallest individual dry mass compared to the other 

zooplankton groups and varied from 1.75 to 26.6 µg with a median of 12.9 µg. The carbon 

and nitrogen mass of copepods varied from 0.78 to 14.6 µg and from 0.31 to 4.04 µg, with 

median values of 6.52 and 1.4 µg, respectively. Copepods metrics are described at (Table 6). 

The fish larvae composed the largest individual dry mass, ranging from 35.6 to 2397 µg and 

showed a median of 100 µg. Carbon and nitrogen values of fish larvae ranged from 17 to 

1160 µg and from 4.74 to 262.9 µg, with median values of 53.9 and 13.57 µg, respectively. 

Fish larvae metrics are described at (Table 6).  

The total length, ESD, body area and biovolume of the total zooplankton were 

significantly correlated with dry, carbon and nitrogen mass (p &amp;lt;0.001 for all correlations) 

(Table 7; Fig. 12 and 13). Conversion factors to estimate the biomass for total zooplankton 

and for zooplankton major groups (copepods, planktonic decapods and fish larvae) are shown 

in Table 7.  

The comparison of the conversion factors proposed in the present study with those 

published by Uye (1982), Alcaraz et al. (2003) and Lehette and Hernández-León (2009) 

showed significant differences (Mann-Whitney test, p &amp;lt;0.001) in their resulting biomass 

estimates. While estimates using the equations of Alcaraz et al. (2003) were several orders 

of magnitude lower than the present results (by up to 54%), the tropical zooplankton biomass 

was overestimated by up to 254% using the conversion factors proposed by Lehette and 

Hernández-León (2009), as compared to the present results. Additionally, biomass 

measurements of tropical zooplankton using the conversion factors proposed by Uye (1982) 

showed errors of biomass estimation around 50% (Table 6).

5.4 DISCUSSION 

The present study provides new carbon and nitrogen content data for common 

zooplankton major groups found in coastal tropical areas of Brazil and shows that the 

individual biomass of these organisms can be precisely estimated based on data of the length, 

ESD, body area, and biovolume measurements obtained through image analysis. Carbon and 

nitrogen percentages of dry mass of tropical zooplankton are similar to those observed in 

other parts of the world (Table 5). However, our results show that dry, carbon and nitrogen 

mass of zooplankton from tropical waters of Brazil are not precisely estimated using the 

current conversion factors from subtropical and polar areas.  

Our dataset did not detect any significant carbon and nitrogen losses in copepods 

and decapods from fixed samples in comparison with carbon and nitrogen contents of 

organisms in fresh samples. These results suggest that these groups preserve the elemental 

composition of their dry mass at least until two months after fixation. In contrast, Omori 

(1978) detected losses of organic weight in chaetognaths and copepods sampled in Suruga 

Bay (Japan) after one week of sample preservation. Alcaraz et al. (2003) analyzed the 

zooplankton community from the Mediterranean Sea and the Galician shelf (North Atlantic) 

and recorded differences in C and N contents of organisms comparing fresh and fixed 

samples after two months of fixation.  

One possible explanation is the gentle procedure of low-speed sampling and careful 

handling of the samples taken in shallow waters, which prevented any significant physical 

damage to these fragile organisms, and thus avoided loss of tissue and liquids in subsequent 

fixation and storage in this study. In contrast, the above mentioned studies were based on 

common offshore sampling from research vessels, which may be more destructive, leading 

to carbon as nitrogen loss from damaged organisms. Therefore, we suggest that any such 

studies should be conducted with slow sampling and careful handling of these fragile 

organisms. 

Also, the different patterns recorded in Alcaraz et al. (2003) in comparison to the 

present study may be due to the fact that those authors analyzed the whole zooplankton 

community (copepods, cladocerans, ostracods appendicularians, other tunicates, cnidarians, 

chaetognaths and invertebrate larvae), while we analyzed pairwise samples of copepods and 

decapods. Probably, rates of carbon and nitrogen losses of the plankton samples, after 



62 
 

fixation, may be different for each specific groups. Other possibility is that zooplankton 

obtained in different regions (upwelled subtropical and tropical waters) may be different 

biomass losses after fixation. 

Investigations on body size and elemental composition of zooplankton elucidate 

important ecological traits of pelagic organisms such as metabolism rates and ecosystem 

productivity (Ikeda and Skjoldal 1989; Kimmel et al. 2006; Ikeda and Mckinnon 2012). Due 

to the difficulties to analyze zooplankton body mass in carbon and nitrogen units, several 

studies on zooplankton ecology approaching analyses of ZooScan images have focused on 

ellipsoid biovolume of organisms to assess the size spectra of zooplankton communities 

(Gilabert 2001; Zhou 2006; Zhou et al. 2009; Basedow et al. 2010; Dai et al. 2016).  

On the other hand, Hernández-León and Montero (2006) suggested that the body 

area of zooplankton is a better parameter, in comparison to biovolume, to create conversion 

factors to estimate biomass through image analysis, since the ellipsoid shape sometimes does 

not represent the real morphology of some zooplankton taxa. However, the results of the 

present study showed that the relationship between the biovolume and the dry mass showed 

the best correlation coefficients compared to the body area, length and ESD, indicating that 

the ellipsoid biovolume may be more useful for such assessments.  

Alcaraz et al. (2003) documented the correlation between carbon and nitrogen 

contents and the ellipsoid biovolume of zooplankton (for the all community, in general, and 

for salps) by analyzing silhouette photographs obtained using a camera attached to 

stereomicroscope. The present study is the first to describe the same relationship by using 

the ZooScan for specific zooplankton groups and corroborate with Alcaraz et al. (2003) 

results, since we observed a strong correlation between carbon and nitrogen mass and 

biovolume for the organisms investigated in Brazilian tropical waters. 

Only few studies have used the conversion factors proposed by Alcaraz et al. (2003) 

to estimate biomass (using carbon and nitrogen units) for whole zooplankton community  

(Frangoulis et al. 2010; Frangoulis et al. 2017). However, the use of the formulas presented 

in this study will help future researchers to convert, length, ESD, body area or biovolume 

data into carbon and nitrogen mass when the biomass of specific-groups of zooplankton be 

the interest of future studies on zooplankton ecology.  



63 
 

Currently, most studies on zooplankton biomass, using data of ZooScan images, 

have applied the conversion factors proposed by Hernández-León and Montero (2006) and 

Lehette and Hernández-León (2009) to achieve the dry mass of zooplankton. In order to 

calculate the carbon and nitrogen mass of major groups, other data sources from literature 

(Beers, 1966, Uye 1982, Cabel and Wiebe 1985, etc.) have been commonly used 

(Vandromme et al. 2012; Schultes et al. 2013; Vandromme et al. 2014; Marcolin et al. 2015). 

In conclusion, the present study provides conversions factors to the direct 

measurement of carbon and nitrogen mass of zooplankton major groups from the tropical 

Atlantic. It also shows that the use of conversion equations to estimate zooplankton biomass 

based on organisms of subtropical and polar waters provides unreliable data in biomass 

estimation of zooplankton from tropical waters. Thus, we expect to prevent such errors in 

biomass estimates using size measurements on further studies about the ecology of tropical 

pelagic communities.

6 ARE TROPICAL COASTAL REEFS SINKS OR SOURCES OF ZOOPLANKTON? A 

CASE STUDY IN A BRAZILIAN MARINE PROTECTED AREA 

 
Abstract 

In spite of the paramount ecological and socio-economic relevance of tropical reefs ecosystems, 

the dynamics of their larvae abundance remain poorly characterized. The small-scale 

distribution and detailed analysis of individual biomass of zooplankton were studied in the 

coastal reefs of Tamandaré (Brazil). Zooplankton samples were collected during nocturnal ebb 

tides at new moon, using three different devices to sample at three different environments: a 

standard ring net that was towed at subsurface, the Channel Midwater Neuston Net that 

collected at midwater in channels between patch reefs and the Reef Edge Net, that captured 

organisms that are washed by ebb currents from reef tops towards the reef edge. Zooplankton 

was analyzed using a ZooScan to obtain abundances and biovolume of each taxonomic groups. 

Specific biomass measurements were done to obtain allometric equations used to calculate 

zooplankton biomass from biovolume. Zooplankton were significantly more abundant at 

subsurface and at the reef edge compared to channel environments. The high abundance of 

organisms at reef edges suggests a low predation pressure on zooplankton at near-bottom areas, 

since the reefs of Tamandaré present a low coverage of planktivorous corals, being dominated 

by macroalgae. These results show that rather than sinks these ecosystems may be considered 

important sources of zooplankton available for planktivorous species.  Regarding zooplankton 

composition, we found large amount of initial stages of meroplanktonic larvae and newly 

hatched fish eggs, which presented consistently greater abundances compared to holoplankton 

and emergent benthic taxa. Decapod larvae were the most abundant group of the meroplankton, 

but cirripedian nauplii, stomatopod larvae, fish larvae and fish eggs were also abundant. More 

than 50% of the total zooplankton estimated biomass was due to meroplankton taxa, mainly 

 



65 
 

composed by decapod larvae. This study shows that the contribution of meroplankton on 

pelagic productivity of tropical reefs has been underestimated.

6.1 INTRODUCTION 

Zooplankton is an important source of carbon within food webs of tropical reef 

ecosystems (Odum e Odum, 1955; Hobson, 1991; Sheppard et al., 2009). In coral reefs, the top 

down control on these pelagic organisms has a particular diel feature: numerous species of 

planktivorous fishes are active predators at near-bottom zones during the day (Hamner et al., 

1988; Hobson, 1991; Motro et al., 2005; Hamner et al., 2007) while most scleractinian corals 

feed on zooplankton at night (Odum e Odum, 1955; Sebens e Deriemer, 1977; Sebens et al., 

1998). This intensive predation causes a severe depletion of zooplankton on reefs with a high 

coverage of corals (located in oligotrophic waters far from coastal areas and estuarine 

influence), which can be observed as a near-bottom depletion of pelagic organisms (Holzman 

et al., 2005; Yahel e Yahel, 2005; Yahel et al., 2005; Hamner et al., 2007; Alldredge e King, 

2009; Heidelberg et al., 2010). These patterns have led to the general characterization of reef 

ecosystems as sinks of zooplankton, a steadfast paradigm in reef ecology.  

Conversely, tropical reefs located along the Brazilian coastline present a high cover of 

macroalgae and a low coverage of corals (Maida e Ferreira, 1997; Barbosa et al., 2009; 

Francini-Filho et al., 2013; Feitosa e Ferreira, 2015; Santos et al., 2015) mainly due to the high 

levels of sedimentation (from estuarine discharges) in reef areas, which interferes on 

scleractinian development (Leão e Dominguez, 2000; Leão e Kikuchi, 2005).  

Studies on zooplankton ecology in waters surrounding Brazilian reefs have recorded 

the numerical dominance of copepods (Mayal et al., 2009; Melo et al., 2010) and its high 

contribution for biomass in zooplankton assemblages (Marcolin et al., 2013). Copepoda is also 

the most important group of typical coral reefs systems (Heidelberg et al., 2004; Nakajima et 

al., 2008; Alldredge e King, 2009; Heidelberg et al., 2010; Nakajima et al., 2014). Due to their 

high abundances, copepod swarms have been considered a relevant carbon source available to 

higher trophic levels of coral reefs (Hamner e Carleton, 1979).  



66 
 

In addition, the presence of a diverse sessile macrofauna in tropical reefs provides a 

relevant supply of meroplankton in pelagic systems since several benthic invertebrates and 

pelagic vertebrates spend the initial phase of theirs lives (eggs and larvae) carried by local 

currents in pelagic environment (Williams et al., 1984; Anger, 2001; Sheppard et al., 2009). 

Thus, production, retention and transport of larvae play an important role in population 

dynamics and connectivity in reef ecosystems (D’agostini et al., 2015; Kough e Paris, 2015).   

In tropical regions, spawning and hatching events are common during the dry season, 

when temperature and wind are high and currents and turbidity are weaker (Williams et al., 

1984; Anger, 2001). Several species of benthic and pelagic organisms release their eggs and 

larvae during nocturnal high and ebb tides (Forward, 1987; Francini et al., 2002; Nanami et al., 

2013) especially during new moon (Williams et al., 1984; Morgan e Christy, 1995; Samoilys, 

1997). This helps to avoid visual predation of larvae and eggs (Nolan e Danilowicz, 2008). 

However, the influence of spawning and hatching events on zooplankton abundance of tropical 

reefs has probably been underestimated, since assessing peaks of larvae release is not a trivial 

task, because I) the navigation around shallow reefs at night is dangerous, II) there are few 

information regarding to duration (minutes, hours) of spawning events and III) methodological 

problems (Santos et al., 2017). 

Although copepods are considered numerically dominant in zooplankton assemblages 

of coral reefs and other marine systems, they are smaller than meroplankton forms (i.e., 

decapods, fish larvae etc) and contributes little for total zooplankton biomass of tropical reefs 

(Heidelberg et al., 2010). However, the relevance of larvae and eggs for the input of biomass 

in pelagic systems around tropical reefs has not been properly approached. Thus, information 

on meroplankton abundance is essential to understand the potential contribution of larvae and 

eggs biomass in food webs of shallow tropical reefs.  

The reefs of Tamandaré are within the largest Marine Protected Area of Brazilian 

coastal waters called “APA Costa dos Corais” (created in 1997). In April 1999 through a federal 

decree a patchy reef within the Tamandaré reef complex known as "Ilha da Barra" and its 

surrounding waters were permanently closed to any fishing and visiting activities. Nowadays, 

this no-take area provides great opportunities to investigate a tropical system without 

anthropogenic activities. The reef tops of the Ilha da Barra closed area are mainly covered by 

the zoanthid Zoanthus sociathus (Ellis, 1768) (30.5%) and by macroalgae (30%), being 



67 
 

dominated by the Rhodophyta Palisada perforta (Bory) KW Nam.  In spite of complete closure 

for more than a decade, these reef tops have a very low coverage of corals (less than 1%) (Santos 

et al., 2015).   

The present study intends to test the hypothesis that coastal tropical reefs characterized 

by low coverage of scleractinian corals are sources of zooplankton for pelagic systems, by 

addressing the question whether zooplankton shows a significant near-bottom depletion 

compared to adjacent channels and subsurface environments. 

If the shallow reef tops of Tamandaré are sinks of zooplankton, samples taken in the 

waters that are washed from the reef tops towards the reef edge should have lower abundances 

of zooplankton compared to samples taken in open waters (channels and subsurface 

environments). If the reef tops are sources of zooplankton, no numerical differences should be 

detected between organisms taken in the waters washed from the reef tops and samples taken 

in open waters. Furthermore, this study investigates the relative importance of meroplankton to 

holoplankton and emergent benthic organisms (bottom-dwelling species, which are suspended 

by waves or perform vertical migration) in these ecosystems.  

 

6.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

6.2.1 Study area 

The reefs of Tamandaré (8º 45’36’’ and 8º47’20’’ S and 35º03’45’’ and 35º06’45’’ 

W) are located in the state of Pernambuco in northeast of Brazil (Fig. 14) under a tropical 

climate with high precipitation (ranging from 81 mm3 to 526 mm3 in summer and winter per 

season, respectively) and average air temperature ranging from 26ºC in the winter to 30ºC in 

the summer (Maida e Ferreira, 1997). This reef system is an important habitat for different life 

stages of fishes that use the estuary as a nursery and perform cross-shelf ontogenetic migrations 

(Silva-Falcão et al., 2012; Aschenbrenner et al., 2016). This ecosystem provides livelihood to 

many families through fishing (octopus, crabs, lobsters, fishes, etc) and tourism activities.  

At the period of this study Chlorophyll a was analyzed using the spectrophotometric 

method (Unesco, 1966) and ranged from 0.01 to 1.27 mg m-3. Temperature and salinity were 

measured using a YSI CastAway CTD (SonTek, San Diego, CA, USA) and ranged from 28.56 

to 30.45 ºC and from 35.46 to 35.84, respectively. The current speed was measured in Ilha da 

Barra channel (depth varying from 7 to 9 m according to the tides) using a S4 current meter 



68 
 

(InterOcean Systems LLC, San Diego, CA, USA) in March and October 2015 and varied from 

3 to 5.8 cm s?1.

6.2.2 Sampling strategy  

Zooplankton samples were obtained in two reef areas with extensive shallow reef tops: 

“Ilha da Barra” (fishing prohibited reef) and “Pirambú” (fishing regulated reef), during three 

campaigns: I) from March 19 to 22 (2015), II) from November 10 to 12 (2015) and III) from 

March 7 to 11 (2016) in consecutive nights of new moon, during the dry season. Three different 

devices were used for zooplankton sampling: a common ring net, the Channel Midwater 

Neuston Net (CMNN) and the Reef Edge Net (REN) (Fig. 14 and 15). 

The CMNN is a set of 6 passive nets (3 nets with 64 µm and 3 with 300 µm mesh 

sizes) adapted to be deployed in channels between patch reefs (Fig. 15) and samples 3 layers: 

the epineuston (air-water interface) at 0 m to 0.075 m, the hyponeuston at 0.075 m to 0.225 m 

(CMNN-neuston) and the 1 m layer (at midwater of channels) at 0.925 m to 1.075 m. The 



69 
 

CMNN sampled the zooplankton transported from reefs towards continental shelf (Santos et 

al., 2017). 

The REN is a set of 2 passive nets (one with 64 µm and another with 300 µm mesh 

sizes) that allows the adjustment of sampling depth at sandy bottom adjacent to reefs (Fig. 15). 

The RENs were deployed approximately 5 m away distant from the reef (to assure safe 

nocturnal navigation) and aligned with the upper edge of each patchy reef (Ilha da Barra and 

Pirambú) studied. The RENs stayed 2.2 m and 1.9 m above the bottom at Ilha da Barra and at 

Pirambú, respectively and sampled the zooplankton washed from near-reef areas (Santos et al., 

2017).  

The tidal amplitude during surveys was 1.85 m. The vertical position of nets from 

CMNN regarding to patch reefs changes according to tidal regime, but all CMNN nets sampled 

similar depth during all ebb tide. In contrast, the position of REN does not changes close to 

edges of patch reefs during ebb tides but the sampling depth changes and showed an average of 

2.1 m in the beginning (at high tide) and 0.4 m in the end of sampling period (late ebb tide).  

Each passive net (CMNN and REN) was deployed before dusk in fixed stations close 

to Ilha da Barra and Pirambu patch reefs (Fig. 14) in high tide regime. They sampled during 

nocturnal ebb tides for approximately 4 hours. In the northeast of Brazil, the sunset occurs 

approximately at 6:00 pm during summer season.  

Subsurface horizontal tows were carried out using a ring net with a 300 µm mesh size (against 

the local current flow) after sunset, from CMNN stations towards the REN stations, during 13 

minutes (Fig. 14 and 15).  

These devices sampled specific environments around the reefs: subsurface (CMNN-

neuston and ring net), channels (the 1 m layer of the CMNN) and the reef edge (REN) (Fig. 

15). All samples were preserved in 4% formaldehyde buffered with 0.05% sodium tetraborate 

(final concentration in seawater). The present study will present only results obtained from the 

300 µm mesh size nets.

During fieldwork the CMNN showed operational problems in epineuston and 

hyponeuston nets (entanglement of nets caused by strong winds), which caused unreliable 

flowmeter readings on some sampling days. The abundances in ring nets and CMNN-neuston 

(epineuston and hyponeuston) were compared from samples of days that we did not have 

problems with entanglement of nets (n = 4). The zooplankton abundance between the ring net 

and the CMNN-neuston did not show differences (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.3429) and the Two-

sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the carbon weight distribution of zooplankton 

in both nets are from the same continuous distribution (h = 0, p = 0.5759). Thus, we considered 

the ring net samples (from all campaigns) to appropriately characterize the subsurface 

environment (Fig. 15 and 16), in an overall comparable way to the stationary nets. In the present 

manuscript, only data from the 1 m layer of the CMNN (channels) will be considered, 

additionally to the REN (reef edges) and ring net (subsurface) samples.

6.2.3 Laboratory methods 

Samples were divided into two size fractions: &gt; 1 mm and &amp;lt;1 mm. Aliquots of each 

fraction were split (when necessary) using a Motoda splitter (Motoda, 1959) and scanned using 

a ZooScan (Hydroptic, France) at 2400 dpi resolution (Grosjean et al., 2004; Gorsky, Gaby et 



72 
 

al., 2010). Some samples were scanned completely (without fractioning) due to their low 

amount of particles. Touching objects were manually separated (for 20 minutes) prior to 

scanning. Each image (containing from 1000 to 1500 objects) created by the scanning was 

processed in ZooProcess software, i.e., vignettes were created of each particle scanned for each 

aliquot. The data set of vignettes was uploaded in the Ecotaxa Plataform (http://ecotaxa.obs-

vlfr.fr) and all vignettes were classified into zooplankton major groups.   

Additionally, fresh organisms were scanned and C and N contents were analyzed using 

a EuroVector elemental analyzer (model Euro EA 3000-Single). Using the major and minor 

axis of each image scanned, the ellipsoid biovolume of zooplankton was calculated using the 

following formula (4/3*?*(major/2)*(minor/2)2). From comparing pairwise measurements of 

individuals C and N content and biovolume, allometric regression equations were developed to 

measure zooplankton biomass. 

  

6.2.4 Data analysis 

Total abundance (ind.m-3) and biomass (ug C m-3) of zooplankton was transformed 

(log x+1) and normality and homoscedasticity were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 

Bartlett tests, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used with Mann-Whitney tests for 

post-hoc pairwise comparisons at ?=0.05 (Zar, 1996). The zooplankton abundance did not show 

statistical differences among or between campaigns. Thus, samples from different campaigns 

were used as replicates. Zooplankton was grouped into 3 categories: meroplankton (Cirripedia, 

Stomatopoda, Decapoda, Teleostei larvae and Teleostei eggs), holoplankton (Hydrozoa, 

Siphonophorae, Gastropoda, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Euphausiacea, Chaetognatha 

Appendicularia) and emergent benthic organisms (i.e., Polychaeta, Cumacea, Mysida, Isopoda, 

Tanaidacea and Amphipoda). The abundance of meroplankton was divided by holoplankton 

abundance plus emergent benthic organism abundance. These ratios were obtained to 

investigate if newly hatched larvae, and eggs show dominance in zooplankton assemblages. 

Abundance and biomass were compared between patch reefs (Ilha da Barra and Pirambu) and 

among sampling environments (subsurface, channel and reef edge). All analyses were 

performed by using Matlab R2017.b.

6.3 RESULTS  

Overall, the zooplankton assemblages of the Tamandaré of reefs showed a high 

contribution of meroplankton groups in relation to holoplanktonic and benthic associated 

organisms, in all sampling days and all environments studied. 

 

6.3.1 Evidence of spawning and hatching events  

Large amounts of early stages of larvae and eggs were sampled. Decapod larvae were 

the most abundant, mainly at the reef edges, with high abundances of larvae of caridean shrimps 

(130.2 ± 196.6 ind.m-3), zoea-stages of brachyuran crabs (46.2 ± 60.2 ind.m-3), hermit crabs 

(12.9 ± 18.65 ind.m-3), lobsters (1.54 ± 3.39 ind.m-3), which included the first record of 

Palinurellus gundlachi larvae and other decapod larvae (33.64 ± 37.16 ind.m-3). Cirripedian 

nauplii and stomatopods larvae also showed high abundances at the reef edges (41.2 ± 74.9 

ind.m-3 and 13.7 ± 24.5 ind.m-3, respectively).  

Furthermore, newly hatched fish larvae were very abundant at the reef edges (108.4 ± 

235.3 ind.m-3). Fish eggs (42.6 ± 40.2 ind.m-3) were also abundant in all campaigns, mainly at 

subsurface. Among fish larvae, yolk-sac and preflexion stages were dominant. Preflexion stages 

were identified as being mostly of the Pomacentridae family.  

 

6.3.2 Composition and distribution of zooplankton  

Decapod larvae was the most abundant group at reef edge (36.8%) and it was also very 

important at subsurface (21.2%) and channels (27.7%). Copepods were the second most 

important group being particular abundant at subsurface (33.5%) (Fig. 17 and Table 9). 

Furthermore, fish eggs were also important at subsurface (10.7%), while stomatopods were 

more important at channels (16.2%) and fish larvae were more relevant at reef edge (17.8%) 

(Fig. 17; Table 9).  

Zooplankton abundance was similar between the closed (Ilha da Barra) and the open-

access (Pirambu) areas (Mann-Whitney tests, p &gt; 0.05). Total abundance did not show 

significant differences between subsurface samples and reef edges, but both environments 

showed significant higher zooplankton abundance compared to the samples taken in the 

channels (Fig. 18; Tables 9 and 10).  



74 
 

Cumaceans and mysids were dominant at subsurface compared to channel and reef 

edge stations. Fish larvae were significantly more abundant at the reef edges and were less 

abundant at subsurface and channel sites (Table 9 and 11).  

Holoplankton and meroplankton abundances did not show any significant difference 

between subsurface and reef edge environments. In opposition to that, emergent benthic 

organisms showed significantly higher abundance at subsurface compared to reef edges (Fig. 

19; Table 10). All three categories, i.e., meroplankton, holoplankton and emergent benthic 

organisms, showed the lowest abundance in the channels compared to subsurface and reef edge 

environments (Fig. 19; Table 10).  

Meroplankon / (holoplankton and emergent benthic organisms) abundance ratios 

showed values above 1 in all environments (Fig. 20). The difference observed in the ratios 

between Ilha da Barra and Pirambu reefs at channels (Mann-Whitney tests, p = 0.02) is mainly 

driven by the high contribution of stomatopod larvae at the Pirambu reef especially during 

campaign 1.

6.3.3 Zooplankton biomass 

More than 50% of the total calculated zooplankton biomass in the reefs of Tamandaré 

was due to meroplankton taxa, mainly composed of decapod larvae, which contributed with 

32.2%, 40.2% and 37.7% for total zooplankton biomass at subsurface, channels and reef edge 

environments, respectively (Fig. 21; Table 12). Stomatopods larvae were also very important 

and represented about 16.8% of total zooplankton biomass in channels sites (Fig. 21; Table 12). 

While copepods contributed around 20-30% for total zooplankton abundance in the Tamandaré 

reefs (Table 9), they accounted for only 16% of the total zooplankton biomass (Fig. 21; Table 

12). Regarding emergent benthic organisms, mysids (11.8%) and cumaceans (5.5%) were the 

most important in biomass at subsurface (Fig. 21; Table 12).

Holoplankton showed the lowest contribution to total zooplankton biomass compared 

to meroplankton and emergent benthic taxa in all the environments investigated (Fig. 21; Table 

12). The zooplankton biomass was the lowest at channels compared to subsurface and reef edge 

environments, but no significant difference was found between the subsurface and the reef edge 

samples (Fig. 21; Table 9 and 12).

6.4 DISCUSSION 

The present study revealed a notable abundance of zooplankton at near-bottom zones 

(sampled at the reef edges). The higher abundance and biomass of holo- and meroplankton at 

the reef edges, as compared to the open water (i.e., channel) samples, indicate that rather than 

sinks these shallow benthic ecosystems were sources of zooplankton during the study period. 

Conversely, previous studies on zooplankton assemblages of coral reefs have reported a strong 

near-reef depletion of zooplankton. Potential causes of this hitherto undescribed inverse pattern 

are discussed hereafter.    

Our results also provide information on the relevance of newly hatched larvae and eggs 

of fish and invertebrates in zooplankton assemblages in shallow tropical reefs. The dominance 

of meroplankton in those communities suggests that the sampling carried out in the present 

study was performed during periods of spawning and hatching events. The high abundance of 

meroplankton in all environments studied in the reefs of Tamandaré (subsurface, channels and 



81 
 

reef edge) shows records of zooplankton released by reef resident organisms (adults of caridean 

shrimps, stomatopods, barnacles, lobsters and fishes) and the consequential contribution of 

larvae and eggs to the zooplankton biomass of coastal pelagic systems around tropical reefs.  

 

6.4.1 Zooplankton composition 

The numerical dominance of meroplankton organisms in relation to holoplankton 

groups is unusual in tropical reefs. Available information on larval variability of benthic species 

in the reefs of Tamandaré is limited to studies focusing on spatial distribution and community 

structure of zooplankton (grey literature) and few records of larvae in samplings using traps 

adapted to catch demersal zooplankton (Melo et al., 2010). Therefore, this study is the first to 

elucidate the relevance of larvae and eggs within zooplankton communities in the reefs of 

Tamandaré.   

Overall, previous studies on zooplankton ecology of shallow tropical reefs have not 

focused on strategies for sampling zooplankton to detect peaks of meroplankton release. 

Heidelberg et al. (2004) suggested that the abundance of some groups of zooplankton around 

tropical reefs have been underestimated, mainly because of inappropriate sampling strategies.  

The use of the CMNN and REN allowed the precise and intensive sampling, for hours, of 

zooplankton close to reefs, which increased the probability of larvae and eggs capture since the 

exact time and duration of larvae release and spawning events are poorly known in tropical 

reefs.    

Although the proper period, which surveys were carried out (summer season, new 

moon and nocturnal ebb tides), i.e. under ideal environmental conditions for larvae and eggs 

release (Forward, 1987; Nanami et al., 2013), the mesh size used in the present study (300 µm) 

may be another important factor that explains the considerable capture of larvae and fish eggs 

in the devices used in the reefs of Tamandaré. Previous studies in tropical reefs have mostly 

focused on zooplankton which was caught by towing and passive nets with much smaller mesh 

sizes, i.e., 40, 80, 90 and 100 µm (Alldredge e King, 1985; Heidelberg et al., 2004; Holzman et 

al., 2005; Yahel et al., 2005; Nakajima et al., 2008; Heidelberg et al., 2010; Nakajima et al., 

2014; Pagano et al., 2017).  

Few studies have recorded peaks of meroplankton in the zooplankton communities 

sampled with small mesh sizes. For instance, Pagano et al. (2017) detected peaks of bivalve 



82 
 

larvae in the zooplankton assemblages sampled with a 80 µm towing net around a reef lagoon 

that harbor an oyster farming in coral reefs from French Polynesia. Nevertheless, small mesh 

apertures (&amp;lt;200) are not suitable for capturing active swimmers such as decapods larvae. 

Additionally, the use of small pumps in coral reefs have demonstrated inefficiency to capture 

larger zooplankton groups, which can easily avoid pumps (Holzman et al., 2005).  

The higher abundance of meroplankton forms rather than holoplankton organisms in 

the zooplankton assemblages recorded in this study is in accordance with Hammer et al. (2007) 

work, which used a similar device to CMNN, i.e., channel nets with 305 µm mesh size which 

sampled during ebb tide periods. The authors reported decapods as the most important group in 

the zooplankton communities, sampled during ebb tides, in Palau barrier reefs (Republic of 

Palau) and highlighted that these reefs produce and export fish eggs to adjacent open sea.  

Alldredge &amp;amp; King (2009) also reported an increase in decapod larvae abundance in the 

zooplankton assemblages sampled with 200 and 300 µm mesh-size nets in the coral reefs of 

Moorea (French Polynesia) during new moon periods. Thus, the use of nets equipped with 200 

and 300 µm mesh sizes around tropical reefs appeared to be suitable for a reliable quantification 

of fish eggs and larvae with swimming abilities, such as decapods and fishes. While small mesh-

size nets (&amp;lt;200 µm) have focused the importance of copepods in tropical reefs, this work 

suggests that the sampling strategy used in the surveys carried out in the reefs of Tamandaré 

highlighted the numerical relevance of meroplankton in relation to copepods in tropical reef 

systems.  

On the other hand, emergent benthic groups were also important in the zooplankton 

assemblages sampled in the reefs of Tamandaré. Peracarid crustaceans have been classified as 

“pseudoplanktonic” organisms by its high abundance in the plankton sampled mainly at night 

around reefs ecosystems (Echelman e Fishelson, 1990). These organisms remain close to the 

bottom or buried during the day, and then migrate towards the surface at night to mate and feed 

in the water column (Johnson et al., 2012a; Johnson et al., 2012b). The high abundance of 

cumaceans and mysids recorded at the subsurface around the reefs of Tamandaré may be related 

to summer reproduction periods and nocturnal feeding habits.

The distribution of zooplankton around the coastal reefs of Tamandaré showed an 

enrichment of organisms at subsurface and at reef edge environments. These results suggest 

that these shallow reef tops did not function as a relevant sink of zooplankton during nocturnal 

ebb tides of new moon days. 

The zooplankton of coral reefs avoids near-bottom areas at night, mainly due to the high 

predation pressure caused by corals. The moonlight also attracts them to the surface. These 

features increases the nocturnal abundance of zooplankton near surface (Alldredge e King, 

1985; Holzman et al., 2005; Yahel e Yahel, 2005; Yahel et al., 2005; Alldredge e King, 2009; 

Heidelberg et al., 2010). In any case, the zooplankton produced around coral reefs is generally 

quickly consumed by planktivorous species (Hamner et al., 1988; Hamner et al., 2007). 

The organisms sampled in RENs were washed by local currents of ebb tides from near-

bottom zones towards reef edge and channel stations. The high abundance of zooplankton at 

reef edge stations may partly be attributed to the low coverage of scleractian corals in the coastal 

reefs of Tamandaré, which probably implicates in a low predation pressure on zooplankton.  

In contrast, the low abundance of zooplankton recorded at midwater in the channels 

around the reefs of Tamandaré indicates that these sites do not seem to be as important as 

subsurface environments for the transportation of organisms from reefs to continental shelf 

during ebb tide regime.   

Overall, the data of this study suggest that the reefs of Tamandaré present a relevant 

stock of zooplankton organisms available for planktivorous predators during nocturnal ebb 

tides. 

 

6.4.3 Benthopelagic coupling 

The results of the present study show a remarkable benthopelagic coupling during the 

surveys carried out in the reef systems of Tamandaré. The significant abundance of fish eggs 

and initial stages of decapod and fish larvae in the zooplankton assemblages sampled in this 

work indicates that the capture of freshly hatched larvae were obtained from adult organisms 

that reside in patch reefs, since early-stage larvae in pelagic systems indicates presence of adult 

stocks (Forward, 1987; Brandão et al., 2015). The values above 1 observed in the ratios of 

meroplankton / (holoplankton and emergent benthic organisms) abundances demonstrate that 



84 
 

the benthopelagic coupling in the reefs of Tamandaré during the period of this study was 

relevant.   

Shallow tropical reefs harbor several species of sponge-inhabiting alpheids, hermit 

crabs, coral guard-crabs, carideans associated with sea anemones, carideans considered fish 

cleaners, etc. (Omori et al., 1994; Gilchrist, 2003; Macdonald et al., 2006; Mccammon et al., 

2010; Mckeon e Moore, 2014). A diverse community of epibenthic and endobenthic decapods 

has been described for these coastal reefs (Giraldes et al., 2015), but the ecology of these 

organisms is still poorly studied.  

The high abundance of zoea stages of caridean shrimps and crabs quantified in this 

work demonstrates the importance of benthic decapods for zooplankton communities in the 

shallow reefs of Tamandaré and opens new perspectives for research on ecology of these 

invertebrates on coastal tropical reefs. The large amounts of stomatopod larvae detected in the 

zooplankton samples also revealed that the shallow sand-gravel seafloor around the reefs of 

Tamandaré harbors an abundant and hitherto unknown population of mantis shrimps. 

Information on these organisms is limited to sporadic records of occurrence (Lucatelli et al., 

2012) but their ecology has not been studied in those reefs yet.  

This study also recorded the first capture of the first zoea-stage of the furry lobster 

Palinurellus gundlachi. This small lobster species displays cryptic habits and is used in 

aquarium trade (Giraldes et al., 2015). Common spiny lobsters, such as Palinurus argus, P. 

echinatus and P. laevicauda are fishing targets in reefs of northeast of Brazil. These species 

usually release their larvae far from the coastal reefs, on the continental shelf or slope (Acosta 

et al., 1999; Jeffs et al., 2005). However, there is no currently information on spawning regimes 

of Palinurellus gundlachi in coastal waters of Brazil. Our results suggest that the sampling of 

the first zoea-stage of P. gundlachi in subsurface waters and in fixed stations (channel and reef 

edge environments) close to reefs indicates that this species releases its larvae around reef 

systems, differently of the Palinurus species that habit the reefs of Tamandaré. Supplementary 

studies are necessary to assess the dynamics of P. gundlachi larval dispersal or retention in 

these coastal tropical areas. 

The nocturnal ebb tide flows around the reefs of Tamandaré also revealed a remarkable 

abundance of fish eggs and fish larvae. It is worth noting that the morphotypes of fish larvae 

sampled in this study are not commonly found in ichthyoplankton samples taken on reefs or 



85 
 

elsewhere in northeastern Brazil. Brazilian coastal reefs harbors a dense community of reef 

fishes from the Pomacentridae family (Feitosa et al., 2012) characterized by a territorial habitat 

(Jones, 2005) and parental care (Bessa e Sabino, 2012; Francini-Filho et al., 2012). However, 

the dynamics of Pomacentridae larvae in Brazilian reefs is poorly studied. Likely, the mesh 

sizes of nets used in previous studies (&amp;lt;300 µm) on zooplankton assemblages were not suitable 

to catch these small larvae. 

The dominance of early hatched fish larvae (mostly of pomacentrids) at the reef edges 

and their hitherto total absence in earlier studies, suggests that these larvae may avoid their 

transport by surface currents towards the continental shelf (at subsurface and channels areas), 

remaining close to the reefs.  

 

6.4.4 Zooplankton biomass 

This study shows for the first time the relevance of meroplankton biomass for pelagic 

systems of tropical reefs, based on their carbon content. Our results are similar to the findings 

of  Heidelberg et al. (2010), who reported that although copepods are considered very abundant 

in zooplankton assemblages of coral reefs of Jamaica (i.e., representing &gt; 85% of total 

abundance) they contributed only 35% to total zooplankton biomass, while larger groups 

(mostly decapods) had a relevant impact on total biomass. However, the authors did not 

describe carbon contents of these specific larger groups of the zooplankton comunities 

investigated.  

Regarding holoplankton organisms, our data show that in the reefs of Tamandaré, 

copepods composed only 16% of total biomass. On other locations (reefs of Malaysia), 

Nakajima et al. (2014) have been reported copepods and larvaceans as the most important 

groups in zooplankton biomass. Besides that, Marcolin et al. (2013) have discussed the 

relevance of copepods and ostracods for the zooplankton biomass in coral reef ecosystems of 

Brazil. However, the influence of ostracods on zooplankton biomass was negligible in the reefs 

of Tamandaré during the period of this study.  

It is worthy noting that although the emergent benthic groups presented low abundance 

in the reefs of Tamandaré, they contributed much more to the total zooplankton biomass than 

holoplankton taxa. Nevertheless, among the all taxa sampled in the reefs of Tamandaré, 

decapod larvae presented the greatest contribution to biomass within the zooplankton 



86 
 

communities. Larger groups (i.e., &gt; 1 mm), such as decapod larvae, stomatopod larvae, 

amphipods, cumaceans, isopods and polychaetes are very important prey for diurnal and 

nocturnal planktivorous fishes in reef systems (Holzman e Genin, 2003). Thus, the 

meroplankton production and the nocturnal vertical migration of emergent benthic organisms 

present a strong influence on transference of carbon to higher trophical levels in tropical reefs.  

Overall, the present study suggests that larval production, additionally to providing 

new settlers for the recruitment of benthic and pelagic species around reefs, has important 

implications for local productivity in pelagic systems of shallow coastal reefs. Therefore, the 

plankton fraction investigated in the present study (including bottom-dwelling organisms found 

in all pelagic environments sampled) shows an important role regarding carbon transfers, 

representing a link between primary energy sources (nano- and microplankton, mucus 

producing by zoanthids and detritous in general, etc.) and planktivorous species of coastal food 

webs. Rather than being sinks, these highly productive coastal reefs are important sources of 

zooplankton to pelagic systems.

7 CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

Nessa tese foram apresentados novos métodos de coleta de zooplâncton para a 

amostragem de organismos em recifes costeiros rasos, visando a captura de larvas e ovos recém 

eclodidos. Também foi realizada uma abordagem inédita para estimativas de biomassa do 

zooplâncton tropical, através da análise de imagens obtidas com o uso do ZooScan, o que 

culminou a elaboração de equações empíricas. Nossos resultados também registram novos 

padrões no tocante à distribuição do zooplâncton no entorno de recifes costeiros tropicais, bem 

como a elucidação de alguns aspectos da interação entre componentes da megafauna residente 

dos recifes e o sistema pelágico adjacente. 

O primeiro capítulo relatou que as redes Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN) e 

Reef Edge Net (REN) foram eficazes na coleta de zooplâncton, com ênfase na captura de ovos 

e larvas de peixes e invertebrados bentônicos que residem nos recifes. O uso destas redes 

permitiu a realização de coletas noturnas e uma quantificação confiável do meroplâncton em 

pontos fixos próximos aos recifes de Tamandaré (PE, Brasil). As estratégias de amostragem de 

zooplâncton com o uso da CMNN e REN abrem novas perspectivas para a realização de estudos 

de monitoramento do zooplâncton em ecossistemas recifais costeiros de águas rasas. 

O segundo capítulo mostrou os erros associados às estimativas de biomassa do 

zooplâncton de origem tropical com o uso de fórmulas elaboradas com a análise de organismos 

de ambientes subtropicais e antárticos. Sugerimos que o uso dos fatores de conversão propostos 

no presente trabalho estimam de forma mais precisa a biomassa do zooplâncton (peso seco, 

massa de carbono e nitrogênio) de origem costeira tropical, baseando-se em dados de 

comprimento, diâmetro esférico equivalente, área e biovolume de organismos.  

O último capítulo mostrou a relevância do meroplâncton na composição e biomassa do 

zooplâncton em um recife costeiro tropical. Estes resultados demonstram que a produção de 

zooplâncton por organismos bentônicos e pelágicos residentes dos recifes de Tamandaré vem 

sendo subestimada, bem como a influência de organismos bentônicos emergentes (misidáceos, 

anfípodes, isópodes e cumáceos), larvas e ovos de peixes e invertebrados bentônicos 

(principalmente decápodes e estomatópodes) no aporte de biomassa para os sistemas pelágicos 

costeiros no entorno desses recifes.  

A análise detalhada da biomassa corporal individual do zooplâncton revelou que as 

larvas de decápodes bentônicos representam o grupo com maior contribuição na biomassa 



88 
 

mesozooplanctônica dos sistemas pelágicos dos recifes de Tamandaré. Os resultados do terceiro 

capitulo também sugerem que a baixa cobertura de corais e a alta cobertura de macroalgas dos 

recifes estudados causam uma pressão predatória baixa nas assembleias de zooplâncton desses 

ambientes, o que pode ser explicado pela abundância alta de zooplâncton nas bordas desses 

recifes.  

Portanto, os recifes de Tamandaré representam um ecossistema produtivo e ao invés de 

sumidouros, podem ser considerados fontes de zooplâncton para o sistema pelágico costeiro. 

Provavelmente, esses recifes são potenciais exportadores de zooplâncton para a plataforma 

continental adjacente durante períodos de liberação de ovos e larvas de peixes e invertebrados 

bentônicos residentes desses recifes. Os dados apresentados nesta tese abrem novas 

perspectivas para a elaboração de estudos que abordam temas como relações tróficas, predação 

do zooplâncton, dispersão, retenção larval, etc., para uma melhor compreensão de outros 

aspectos ecológicos do meroplâncton desses ecossistemas tropicais costeiros.
