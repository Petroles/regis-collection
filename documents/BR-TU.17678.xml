Abstract
Root and stem wood anatomy of C. myrianthum (Verbenaceae) from a semideciduous seasonal forest in 
Botucatu municipality (22º52’20”S and 48º26’37”W), São Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. Growth increments 
demarcated by semi-ring porosity and marginal bands of axial parenchyma were observed in the wood of both 
root and stem. Many qualitative features were the same in both root and stem: fine helical thickenings, and 
simple and multiple perforation plates in vessel elements; large quantities of axial parenchyma in the growth 
rings, grading from marginal bands and confluent forming irregular bands in earlywood to lozenge aliform in 
latewood; axial parenchyma cells forked, and varied wall projections and undulations; septate fibres; forked 
and diverse fibre endings. Quantitative features differing between root and stem wood were evaluated using 
student’s t-test, and vessel frequency, vessel element length, vessel diameter, ray height, and vulnerability 
and mesomorphy indices differed significantly. Root wood had lower frequency of vessels, narrower and 
longer vessel elements, and taller rays than wood of the stem. The calculated vulnerability and mesomorphy 
indices indicated that C. myrianthum plants are mesomorphic. Roots seem to be more susceptible to water 
stress than the stem.
Key words: secondary xylem, semideciduous seasonal forest, wood anatomy.
Resumo
A anatomia da madeira da raiz e do caule de Citharexylum myrianthum (Verbenaceae) que ocorre em uma 
área de floresta estacional semidecídua próximo à cidade de Botucatu (22º52’20”S e 48º26’37”W), estado 
de São Paulo, Brasil, foi estudada. Camadas de crescimento distintas, demarcadas por anel semi-poroso e 
faixas marginais de parênquima axial foram observadas em ambos os órgãos. As características qualitativas 
observadas tanto em raiz quanto em caule foram: espessamentos helicoidais finos e placas de perfuração 
simples e múltiplas em elementos de vaso; grandes quantidades de parênquima axial nos anéis de crescimento, 
em faixas marginais a confluente formando faixas irregulares no lenho inicial a aliforme losangular no lenho 
tardio; células do parênquima axial bifurcadas, com projeções e ondulações na parede; fibras septadas; fibras 
bifurcadas e com diversas terminações. Na análise quantitativa comparativa entre raiz e caule foi aplicado 
teste t-student que mostrou diferenças significativas na frequência e diâmetro de vasos; comprimento dos 
elementos de vaso; altura dos raios; índices de vulnerabilidade e mesomorfia. A madeira da raiz teve menor 
frequência de vasos, vasos com menor diâmetro e elementos mais longos, e raios mais altos. Os índices 
de vulnerabilidade e mesomorfia indicaram que as plantas de C. myrianthum são mesomórficas. As raízes 
parecem estar mais susceptíveis ao estresse hídrico do que os caules.

Introduction
C i t h a re x y l u m  m y r i a n t h u m  C h a m . ,  a 

deciduous tree, reaches 8 to 15 m in height and 20 
to 40 cm in breast height diameter, and has a wide 

occurrence in Brazilian forest formations (latitude 
14045’?31050’S). It occurs in Dense Ombrophilous 
Forest (Atlantic Rain Forest sensu stricto), semi-
deciduous seasonal forest, riparian areas (Carvalho 



568 Marcati, C.R. et al.

Rodriguésia 65(3): 567-576. 2014

1994), and also in  lowland dry tropical forest 
(Tabarelli 1992). The rapid growth makes C. 
myrianthum an important species for restoration 
of degraded areas (Sansevero et al. 2009). 

General descriptions of wood anatomy of the 
genus Citharexylum have already been reported by 
Metcalfe and Chalk (1950). For C. myrianthum, 
Gomes et al. (1989) studied stem wood anatomy 
from trees that occurred in eastern part of Paraná state 
(South Brazil) and it was the first time that radiate 
perforation plates in vessels were mentioned in this 
species. Barros et al. (2001) described the wood 
anatomy of trees from a seasonally flooded forest 
of the Reserva Biológica de Poço das Antas (Rio de 
Janeiro state, Southern Brazil). Cambial activity and 
the seasonal formation of secondary xylem in stems 
of C. myrianthum occurring at São Paulo State were 
studied by Marcati (2000) and annual growth rings 
were observed in the wood. Seasonal presence of 
acicular calcium oxalate crystals in the cambial zone, 
with greater abundance in dry than in wet periods, 
was reported for this species (Marcati 2000; Marcati 
&amp;amp; Angyalossy 2005). Across this rich body of work, 
only stem wood was studied.

P e r h a p s  n o t  s u r p r i s i n g l y,  g i v e n  t h e 
comparative difficulty of collection specimens, 
root wood anatomy, in general, has received much 
less attention than stem wood anatomy (e.g. Gasson 
&amp;amp; Cutler 1990). When studied, physiological and 
anatomical research demonstrated that within a 
species, root xylem has wider vessels than stem 
xylem and that root wood is more vulnerable to 
embolism than stem wood (Alder et al. 1996; Ewers 
et al. 1997; Machado et al. 1997; Kavanagh et al. 
1999; Kolb &amp;amp; Sperry 1999; McElrone et al. 2004; 
Psaras &amp;amp; Sofroniou 2004). 

The objectives of this study were to compare 
root and stem wood anatomy of Citharexylum 

myrianthum qualitatively and quantitatively and 
to relate any anatomical differences between the 
organs to their function and ecological adaptations.

Material and Methods
Citharexylum myrianthum were collected in a 

semi-deciduous seasonal forest in the municipality 
of Botucatu (22052’20’’S, 48026’37’’W), São 
Paulo state, south-eastern Brazil. The average 
annual rainfall is about 1300 mm, with a mean 
annual temperature of 20°C. July is the driest and 
coldest month with mean temperature of 15°C, 
and January is the wettest and warmest month 
with mean temperature of 25°C. The dry season 
typically extends from May to September (Fig. 
1). Climate data were obtained from the Estação 
Meteorológica of the Faculdade de Ciências 
Agronômicas, UNESP, Botucatu, São Paulo State. 
The Estação Meteorológica was about 11 km from 
the study site.

Stem and main root samples from three 
adult specimens (Tab. 1) were collected at 1.30 
m and 30 cm distal from root collar, respectively. 
Wood samples from sapwood were fixed in 
70% ethanol. Transverse, radial and tangential 
sections (10–18 ?m) were cut using a sliding 
microtome. These sections were double stained 
with 1% aqueous solution of fuchsin and astra 
blue (Roeser 1972) and mounted on slides in 
Entelan® synthetic medium. Some root and stem 
materials were macerated in a mixture of equal 
volumes of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide 
at 60°C (Johansen 1940) for 12 to 24 hours. The 
material was stained with 1% aqueous solution of 
safranin and mounted in glycerin. The presence 
of calcium oxalate was confirmed, since dilutions 
with hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced no effect 
(Chamberlain 1932).

Wood descriptions follow the microscopic 
features definitions of IAWA Committee (1989).

The vouchers and samples of root and 
stem wood were deposited, respectively, in the 
Herbarium (BOT) and in the Wood Collection 
(BOTw) (Tab. 1) of the Departamento de Recursos 
Naturais, Faculdade de Ciências Agronômicas, 
UNESP, São Paulo.

Quantitative data were based on 30 individual 
counts per specimen; the statistical requirements 
or minimum numbers of measurements were 
fulfilled: n = (t value)2 * (sample variance)/
(accuracy of 10% × sample mean)2, following 
Freese (1967) and Eckblad (1991). The numerical 

values given in Table 2 are the means accompanied 
b y  s t a n d a r d  d e v i a t i o n .  Wo o d  a n a t o m i c a l 
parameters were analysed statistically using the 
Student’s t-test and a threshold of p&amp;lt;= 0.05 for 
significance (Zar 1996).

Results
Q u a l i t a t i v e  a n a t o m i c a l  f e a t u r e s  o f 

Citharexylum myrianthum did not vary between 
stem and root wood; differences between the 
organs were found only in quantitative features 
(Tab. 2).

Growth rings ? distinct, delimited by 
marginal bands, semi-ring-porous wood (Fig. 
2a-b), and slightly distended rays in earlywood, 
and radially flattened fibers with thick walls in 
the latewood. In addition, the axial parenchyma 
pattern varied through the growth ring, with 
marginal bands and confluent irregular bands in 
the earlywood, and confluent and lozenge-aliform 
in latewood (Fig. 2a-b).

Vessels: predominantly solitary (70?92%), 
in multiples of 2 (7?24%) and of 3?6 (0,8?9%); 
fine helical thickenings throughout the body of 
vessel element in both earlywood and latewood

a greater appreciation for the variability of the 
soil environment and its influence on plant 
development can be gained. The trees studied 
here grew in a semi-deciduous seasonal forest 
with a dry season of about 5 months. During the 
dry season, soil water availability is low (Borchert 
1994) and thus the roots experience at least one 
form of distinct seasonality presumably sufficient 
to signal distinct growth increment formation in 
the roots. 

Semi-ring porous wood and marginal bands 
of axial parenchyma delimiting growth rings have 
already been described by Metcalfe &amp;amp; Chalk (1950) 
in Citharexylum, and by Gomes et al. (1989) in C. 
myrianthum specifically, but only for stem wood. 
Metcalfe &amp;amp; Chalk (1950) stated that semi-ring 
porous wood is a common feature to Verbenaceae 
and, according to Carlquist (2001), this feature 
would provide functional advantage to the species 
as wide earlywood vessels would accommodate 
larger volumes of water in wet seasons while 
narrow latewood vessels maximize the resistance 
to cavitation during the dry season. If this rationale 
holds true, the presence of semi-ring porosity in 
the roots suggests that the seasonality of soil water 
availability may strongly influence root wood 
vessel diameter. 

Combinations of simple and multiple 
perforation plates in Verbenaceae woody species are 

Discussion 
Our observations of the stem wood of 

Citharexylum myrianthum are in concordance, in 
general, with previous descriptions of the genus 
(Metcalfe &amp;amp; Chalk 1950; Détienne &amp;amp; Jacquet 1983) 
and of the species (Gomes et al. 1989; Marcati 
2000; Barros et al. 2001). The inclusion of root 
wood anatomy in this study broadens the literature 
on C. myrianthum and allows for within-plant 
organographic comparisons. 

The presence of growth rings in root 
wood has been demonstrated for a variety of 
different species in diverse habitats, such as in 
Styrax (Styracaceae) (Machado et al. 1997), in 
Clusia criuva (Clusiaceae) (Esemann-Quadros 
2001), and in Lippia salviifolia (Verbenaceae) 
(Goulart &amp;amp; Marcati 2008). These findings provide 
counterexamples to the assertions of Ledebenko 
(1962) and Brown (1971), who suggested that root 
wood is less likely to form growth rings because of 
the comparative uniformity of the environmental 
conditions in the soil. Esemann-Quadros (2001), 
Machado et al. (1997) and Goulart &amp;amp; Marcati 
(2008) suggested that the seasonal soil water 
availability might be an important factor affecting 
the formation of growth rings in the wood of roots 
and stems. We agree with these authors and further 
suggest that by tracking such soil parameters,

common and were described in Vitex sp. (Metcalfe 
&amp;amp; Chalk 1950), Citharexylum myrianthum (Gomes 
et al. 1989; Marcati 2000; Barros et al. 2001), 
Gmelina arborea (Ohtani et al. 1989), and Lippia 
salviifolia (Goulart &amp;amp; Marcati 2008). According 
to Gomes et al. (1989), there are different 
multiple perforation plates in C. myrianthum 
wood, including radiate and also derivatives from 
foraminate and reticulate types, and that agrees with 
what was found in this study. Multiple perforation 
plates in wood may function in preventing the 
spread of air embolisms by retaining air bubbles 
(Wheeler &amp;amp; Baas 1991). With such a functional 
interpretation, multiple perforation plates and semi-
ring porous wood would be important contributors 
to the physiology of this species and its growth in 
a seasonally dry environment. 

Fine helical thickenings in vessel walls were 
also observed by Gomes et al. (1989) and Barros et 
al. (2001) to Citharexylum myrianthum. Carlquist 
(2001) pointed out that the helical thickenings on 
the vessel walls would increase the contact area 
between the vessel wall and water column, and 
might increase the mechanical resistance of the 
vessel walls. We observed no change in distribution 
of helical thickenings from earlywood to latewood 
in C. myrianthum in stem or root, suggesting that 
an important physiological role related to seasonal 
water stress is unlikely in this species. 

The variation in the axial parenchyma 
through the increment zone, grading from 
marginal bands and confluent irregular bands 
in the earlywood to lozenge aliform in the 
latewood, and in some places rays slightly 
distended when crossing the marginal bands of 
axial parenchyma were described for the first 
time to this species. Marcati et al. (2006) reported 
distended rays delimiting growth rings in addition 
to other markers to some species from cerrado 
(Piptocarpha rotundifolia (Asteraceae), Annona 
coriacea and A. crassiflora (Annonaceae)). The 
distended rays delimiting growth rings might 
be advantageous in addition to the other growth 
markers helping the dendrochronologists in the 
correct distinction of the growth rings limits.

Septate fibres are common in Verbenaceae 
species, and they were observed in the root and 
stem wood of Citharexylum myrianthum. As they 
are living fibres, they could play a role in water 
and starch storage (Carlquist 2001, 2012), and this 
might be important in the seasonal environments 
where the species are growing.

Typically, root vessels are wider than stem 
vessels (Alder et al. 1996; Ewers et al. 1997; 
Machado et al. 1997; Kavanagh et al. 1999; Kolb 
&amp;amp; Sperry 1999; McElrone et al. 2004; Psaras &amp;amp; 
Sofroniou 2004). The opposite was observed in this 
study in Citharexylum myrianthum, Styrax forest 
species (Machado et al. 2007) and Leguminosae 
lianas (Ewers et al. 1997). Christensen-Dalsgaard 
et al. (2007) associated the smallest vessels and 
the lowest vessel frequency to parts of the root 
and stem subjected to the greatest mechanical 
stresses or strains, observing a trade-off between 
hydraulic conductivity and wood stiffness. The 
semi-ring porosity of the root wood combined with 
larger amounts of axial parenchyma surrounding 
the vessels may provide functional advantages 
to the species during the dry season. The axial 
parenchyma surrounding the narrower vessels may 
play a role in regulating the osmotic potential of 
the sap in the dry season, permitting the plants to 
take up water or refill embolized vessels.

In conclusion, Citharexylum myrianthum root 
and stem wood were different in quantitative but 
not qualitative features. The root wood had lower 
frequency of vessels, narrower and longer vessel 
elements, a greater abundance of paratracheal axial 
parenchyma in the latewood, and taller rays than 
the wood of the stem. The calculated vulnerability 
and mesomorphy indices (Carlquist 1977) indicated 
that C. myrianthum is mesomorphic, but by 
comparison, the roots are more susceptible to water 
stress than the stem. The overall physiognomy of 
the wood suggests anatomical specialization to 
seasonally dry environment.
