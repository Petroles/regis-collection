Pelagic juvenile wreckfish, Polyprion americanus (Schneider, 1801) were tagged in the 
surface waters around the Central Group of the Azores. One wreckfish was recaptured 
three months after tagging, and 217 km from its release point. It had settled to the bottom 
i n  254 m of water. The recapture of this specimen suggests that wreckfish take up a 
demersal life at a total length of about 50 cm.

INTRODUCTION 

The wreokfish, Polyprion americanus 

(Schneider, 1801), is globally distributed in 
temperate rocky-bottom habitats on insular and 

continental slopes. In the western Atlantic 
Ocean, wreckfish are found from about 45"N to 
45"s. The wreckfish is a large demersal species, 
and adults in the western North Atlantic are 

known only from rocky bottom and coral 
pinnacles on the Blake Plateau and Great and 

Little Bahama Banks, in depths from 450 to 600 

m (SEDBERRY et al. 1994; SEDBERRY et al. 1996). 
Spawning occurs on the Blake Plateau, primarily 

in February and March (D. Wyanski pers. comm.). 
While large demersal wreckfish have a limited 
distribution in the western Atlantic, pelagic 

juveniles are found north of Cape Hatteras, and 
into Canadian waters, and are abundant in the 
eastern North Atlantic. Juvenile wreckfish live at 
the surface to a length of at least 30 cm, where 

they associate with floating objects (ROBERTS 
1989). Wreckfish are recruited to the Blake 

Plateau at age four, which corresponds to a mean 



total length of 68 cm (G. SEDBERRY et al. 
unpubl.). Wreckfish smaller than 65 cm total 
length have not been observed in fishery 

landings, by research vessel, or from submersible 
on the Blake Plateau, and fish less than 85 cm 
are very rare there (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). 

The fishery for wreckfish in the southeastern 
United States developed in the mid-1980s, and 
the species formerly had been considered rare in 
the western North Atlantic (ROBINS &amp;amp; RAY 
1986). Because of its perceived rarity and very 
specific habitat requirements, the wreckfish has 
been managed conservatively. SEDBERRY et al. 
(1994) reviewed development of the fishery from 
its establishment through the first management 
plans. Management measures in the U.S. now 
include a total allowable catch, individual 
transferable quotas, gear restrictions (no 
longlines) and a spawning season closure of the 

fishery. The management plan assumed a single 
stock of wreckfish in the North Atlantic, which 
has since been confirmed with mtDNA analyses 
(SEDBERRY et al. 1996). However, little is 
known about recruitment of wreckfish to the 
Blake Plateau fishing grounds, or when or where 
pelagic juveniles from Blake Plateau spawning 
descend to their adult benthic habitat. A single 
genetic stock of wreckfish extends from the only 
documented North Atlantic spawning grounds 
off South Carolina to the Madeira archipelago 
and Mediterranean Sea (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). 
Mechanisms for maintaining gene flow, and the 
patterns of recruitment of juveniles and adults 
are poorly understood, but some active adult 
migration or drifting of pelagic juvenile phases 
must be involved (SEDBERRY et al. 1996). 

American wreckfish are often caught on the 
Blake Plateau fishing grounds with fish hooks, 
already in their mouths and guts, which are of a 
type not used by American fishermen. SEDBERRY 
et al. (1996) speculated that these hooks, which 
are used by European fishermen, are acquired by 
demersal wreckfish in the eastern Atlantic from 
bottom longlines, before migrating to the Blake 
Plateau. 

To explain distribution of mtDNA haplotypes 
in the North Atlantic and to corroborate the 
circumstantial evidence about recruitment 
patterns derived from fish hooks (SEDBERRY et 

al. 1996), we began tagging pelagic juvenile 
wreckfish in the eastern Atlantic, around the 
Azores and Madeira archipelagos. Here we report 
the recapture of a tagged juvenile wreckfish. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Wreckfish (n=20) were tagged with nylon dart 
tags (Hallprint 146 mm) inserted with a canula 
between the pterygiophores of the first dorsal fin. 
Five fish were double-tagged with an internal 
anchor tag (Floy 0.5 x 1.9 cm oval anchor; 7.6 cm 

streamer) in addition to the dart. Tagging took 
place in waters adjacent to the Central Group of 
islands of the Azores archipelago (Fig. 1). Tags 
were printed with identification numbers and the 
word "reward" and "mail to" in English, French, 
Portuguese and Spanish. The return address of the 
senior author's laboratory was printed on the tag. 
Posters describing the tagging program and 
advertising a reward (in the four languages) were 
distributed among the major fishing ports in the 
Azores, Madeira, Canary islands and Majorca, 
with instructions to contact either of the authors' 
laboratories. The tagging program was publicised 
in the southeastern U.S. with posters and press 
releases. 

Epipelagic juvenile wreckfish for tagging were 
located by spotting floating debris and dipnetting 
or angling fishes associated with the debris. 
Tagging took place in June 1996 (n=l), and in 
April (n=14) and July (n=5) 1997. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Floating objects with which wreckfish were found 
consisted primarily of plastic debris, including 
sheeting, packaging, shopping b a g ,  buckets, jugs, 
buoys and polypropylene line; styrofoam floats; 
sealed metal cans; glass bottles; and vegetable 
matter such as woody plants and branches, 
lumber, and (rarely) coconuts. Juvenile wreckfish 
were most commonly associated with floating 
plastic buckets and ,'boxes with 'some barnacle 
encrustation, and would only venture out to take 
bait when other small fish species were present. 
These species wefe most commonly grey 
triggerfish, Balistes capriscus; &amp;amp;d oceanic boy 
mackerel, Trqchurus picturatus. Other species 
encountered with floating objects included 





pompano, Trachinotus ovatus; the centrolophid 

Schedophilus ovalis; and pilotfish, Naucrates 

ductor. Juvenile loggerhead turtles, Caretta 
caretta, were often observed when looking for 

debris. Occasionally, presumed predators of 

juvenile wreckfish (dolphin fish, Coryphaena 

hippurus; sharks, Isurus sp. and Sphyrna sp.) 
were encountered beneath windrows and near 
debris, and no wreckfish or other small fishes 

were encountered when large predators were 

present. 
One wreckfish we tagged at the surface, near 

a floating tree, in approximately 1000 m of water 

near Condor de Fora Seamount, 38 krn southwest 
of Horta on Faial Island (tagging location: 
38"22'N, 29'00'W), was later recaptured. This 

fish was 49.0 cm total length when tagged on 6 
April 1997, and it was recaptured on 9 July 1997 
by a commercial fisherman using bottom 
longline in 254 m depth. The specimen was 
caught 217 km east-southeast of its release point, 

at a location 0.9 km east of Banco D. Jolo de 
Castro (at 38'13.6'N, 26'33.9W). The wreckfish 
weighed 2.85 kg when recaptured, which 

indicates a total length of 50.1 cm, according to 
the length-weight regression provided by 

SEDBERRY et al. (1994). 
The wreckfish congener Polyprion 

oxygeneios also lives at the surface as a juvenile, 
and switches from pelagic to the demersal habitat 
at around 50 cm TL and 3-4 years old (M. 
Francis pers. comm.). Wreckfish also apparently 
take up the demersal habitat at about 50 cm. We 
have not aged wreckfish this small, but data from 
P. oxygeneios suggest that these fish may be over 
one year old, and theoretical and back-calculated 

wreckfish lengths at age indicate that these fish 

may be two years old or older (G. SEDBERRY et 

al. unpubl). 
This change in size and depth from tagging to 

recapture is consistent with known and surmised 

life history, and this is the first documentation of 
wreckfish completing a transition from the 

epipelagic to benthic habitat. Additional tag 

recoveries should further elucidate the timing and 

nature of the transition for the North Atlantic 
population.
