Resumo 

 

O Complexo migmatítico-graniulítico-granítico Nova Venécia (CNV), localizado no núcleo do Orógeno 

Araçuaí (OA, 630-480 Ma), sudeste do Brasil, registra processos crustais anatéticos ocorridos no norte 

da Província Mantiqueira durante a amalgamação Brasiliana-Pan Africana de Gondwana Ocidental. O 

núcleo do OA compreende abundantes e volumosos granitoides tipo-S e –I (Supersuítes G1 a G5), que 

são espacialmente e temporalmente associados a eventos metamórficos de alto grau no NVC. Este 

estudo integra observações de campo, análises de química mineral, petrografia, geocronologia U-Pb LA-

ICP-MS de zircões e monazitas e modelagem termodinâmica, a fim de definir a evolução dos 

migmatitos-granulitos do CNV, desde sua deposição até o metamorfismo de alto grau, e correlacionar a 

história metamórfica com os vários episódios de magmatismo granítico (G1-G5). Sete populações 

compõe a base de dados de zircões detríticos. A gama mais significativa de zircões detríticos 

concordantes zircão são representados pelas duas populações mais jovens, variando 650-610 Ma. Isso 

indica que a principal fonte do CNV é provavelmente o Arco Rio Doce, com contribuições menores de 

fontes contemporâneas ao Arco Rio Negro. Populações mais velhas sugerem proveniência dos primeiros 

registros do arco Rio Negro e de segmentos do OA relacionados a riftes de idades Criogeniana e 

Toniana. O período de sedimentação do CNV é limitado entre a idade máxima de sedimentação em ca. 

606 Ma e a intrusão dos primeiros granitóides sin-colisionais (ca. 593 Ma), ou seja, durante ca. 13 Ma. 

Compilação dos dados disponíveis de U-Pb em zircão mostra que a maior parte dos granitoides G1 e G2 

se cristalizaram contemporaneamente ao longo de um período de 15 Ma (595-570 Ma, com um pico a 

575 Ma), interpretado como o período sin-colisional no OA. O período de pico metamórfico regional 

no OA é limitado em 575-560 Ma, o que pode ser uma consequência de magma underplating G1 + G2. 

Petrografia detalhada e análises de química mineral mostram diferentes assembléias de pico 

metamórfico (regional) que contêm quantidades variáveis de granada, ortopiroxênio e cordierita 

peritéticos e cordierite retrógrada. Sugerimos que essas diferenças são principalmente devidas a 

parâmetros de composição dos protólitos, e não devidas a diferentes evoluções de P-T entre as amostras. 

A química de rocha total neste estudo sugere que os protólitos do CNV eram grauvacas peraluminosas 

contendo diferentes quantidades de componentes de matriz (isto é, porções pelíticas) e que as rochas de 

alto-grau do CNV devem ter perdido melt para terem se tornado caracteristicamente restíticas. Isto é 

corroborado pelo nosso conjunto de dados de zircões detríticos, que mostram diferentes contribuições 

percentuais entre as 7 populações que compõem as amostras. Além disso, a modelagem termodinâmica 

indica que todas as amostras modeladas registram um caminho P-T semelhante, desde condições PT de 

metamorfismo regional de pico a 750-850 ° C e 5300-7500 bares (granulito, profundidades de ~ 25 km) 

a condições de estabilidade das assembléias preservadas a 640- 800 ° C e 4500-6000 bares (transição 

entre amfibolito superior a granulito, profundidades de ~ 18 km). Infere-se que o metamorfismo regional 

de alto grau (575-560 Ma) deve ter afetado ambos os metassedimentos e granitos pré-existentes, 

corroborado pelo fato de que ambos mostram feições anatéticas datadas em ca. 571 Ma. Os produtos da 

fusão parcial em todo o OA poderia ser, pelo menos, parte dos granitóides contemporâneos àqueles 

formados durante os períodos G2 (570-540 Ma) e G3 + G4 (540-525 Ma). O evento térmico pós-

colisional G5 (520-480 Ma), relacionado ao colapso tectônico do OA, é registrado em metagrauvacas 

(monazita U-Pb) e em granitos (monazita e zircão U-Pb) entre 507 e 495 Ma. Sugerimos que, a essa 

altura, as metagrauvacas já haviam sido submetidas a alguma descompressão e arrefecimento, com base 

em modelagem metamórfica, observações de campo e datação de um dique tardio não deformado que 

intrude rochas do CNV (518 Ma). Infere-se que o evento termal pós-colisional G5, registrado por 

abundantes intrusões de granitoides tipo-I em todo o OA, causou um segundo período de metamorfismo 

de alto-grau a ca. 500 Ma. A principal característica deste evento em rochas metassedimentares é, além 

das idades U-Pb em monazitas, um overprint parcial de Baixa Pressão-Alta Temperatura em assembléias 

regionais de pico, gerando cordierita texturalmente tardia e espinélio hercinítico. Em nossas amostras, 

este registro metamórfico limita-se a auréolas de contato.

Abstract 
 

The Nova Venécia migmatite-granulite-granite Complex (NVC) in the core of the Araçuaí Orogen (AO, 

630-480 Ma), southeast Brazil, records anatectic crustal processes occurring in the northern Mantiqueira 

Province during the Brasiliano-Pan African amalgamation of West Gondwana. The AO core comprises 

abundant S- and I-type granitoids (G1 to G5 Supersuites) that are spatially and temporally associated 

with high-grade metamorphic events in the NVC. This study integrates field-based observations, textural 

and mineral chemistry analyses, zircon and monazite U-Pb LA-ICP-MS geochronology and 

thermodynamic modeling in order to constrain the evolution of the NVC migmatites-granulites from 

deposition to high-grade metamorphism, and to correlate the metamorphic history with the several 

episodes of granite magmatism (G1-G5). Seven populations compose the NVC zircon detrital dataset. 

The most significant range of concordant detrital zircon ages are obtained from the two youngest 

populations, ranging from 650 to 610 Ma. This indicates the main NVC source is probably the Rio Doce 

Arc, with minor contributions from sources contemporaneous to the Rio Negro Arc. Older populations 

suggest provenance from the early Rio Negro arc and from Cryogenian and Tonian rift-related segments 

of the AO. The period of NVC protolith sedimentation is bracketed between its maximum sedimentation 

age at ca. 606 Ma and the intrusion of early syn-collisional granitoids (ca. 593 Ma), i.e. ca. 13 My. 

Compilation of the available U-Pb data shows that the bulk of the G1 and G2 rocks crystalized 

contemporaneously over a period of 15 Ma (595-570 Ma, with a peak at 575 Ma), interpreted to represent 

the AO syn-collisional period. The period of peak regional metamorphism in the AO is constrained at 

575-560 Ma, which may be a consequence of G1 + G2 magma underplating.  Detailed petrography and 

extensive mineral chemistry analyses show different (regional) peak metamorphic assemblages 

containing variable amounts of peritectic garnet, orthopyroxene and cordierite, and retrograde cordierite. 

We suggest these differences are mainly due to protoliths compositional parameters, and not due to 

different P-T evolution among samples. Our whole-chemistry suggests that NVC protoliths were 

peraluminous greywackes probably containing different amounts of matrix components (i.e. pelitic 

portions) and that NVC high-grade metagreywackes must have lost melt to become restitic in character. 

This is corroborated by our detrital zircon dataset showing different percentage contributions from 7 

populations among samples. Moreover, thermodynamic modeling indicates that all modeled samples 

record a similar P-T path, recording P-T conditions of peak regional metamorphism of 750-850 °C and 

5300-7500 bars (granulite, depths of ~25 km) and stability of preserved assemblages of 640-800 °C and 

4500-6000 bars (transition between upper amphibolite to granulite, depths of ~18 km). The high-grade 

regional metamorphism (575-560 Ma) is inferred to have affected both metasediments and pre-existing 

granites, as suggested by partial melting in both of sampled rock-types at ca. 571 Ma. The products of 

partial melting throughtout the AO could be at least part of the granitoids contemporaneous to G2 (570-

540 Ma) and G3 + G4 (540-525 Ma) periods. The post-collisional G5 thermal event (520-480 Ma), 

related to tectonic collapse of OA, is recorded in metagraywackes (monazite U-Pb) and granites 

(monazite and zircon U-Pb) between 523 and 495 Ma. We infer that, by this time, the metagreywackes 

had already undergone some decompression and cooling, based on metamorphic modeling, field 

observations and dating an undeformed late dyke (518 Ma). The post-collisional G5 thermal event, 

recorded by abundant granitic intrusions of I-type granitoids throughout the AO, is inferred to have 

caused a second high-grade metamorphic event at ca. 500 Ma. In addition to monazite U-Pb ages, the 

main record of this event in metasedimentary rocks is a partial LP-HT overprinting in regional peak 

assemblages, with generation of texturally late cordierite and hercynitic spinel. In our samples, this 

metamorphic record is limited to contact aureoles.

CHAPTER 1  

INTRODUCTION 

The P-T-t evolution of high-grade orogenic cores are recorded in migmatites, granulites and 

associated granites, which account for processes of melt/magma production, extraction and 

emplacement that ultimately lead to crustal differentiation. Migmatitic and granulitic terranes in 

orogenic belts that record thickening before maximum temperatures are achieved typically display 

clockwise P-T paths (Brown 1994). Within this path, metamorphic peak is achieved during prograde 

heating, which is followed by near-isothermal decompression and a posterior close to isobaric cooling 

(Yakymchuck and Brown 2014). Reactions occuring during prograde heating generate melt, the loss of 

which produce high-grade mineral assemblages (Brown and Korhonen 2009). Residual compositions 

and preserved anhydrous high-grade mineral assemblages with minor evidence of retrogression are 

consistent with loss or isolation of melt from these middle to lower crustal domains (Brown 2004). As 

H2O strongly partitions into the melt, melt isolation and loss creates a system where no free H2O-rich 

volatile phase attends high-grade metamorphism (Brown and Korhonen 2009).  

Many studies suggest that, at high-T conditions (T &gt; 800°C), fluid-absent reactions dominate 

during most crustal melting and production of mobile, large-volume granitic magmas (e.g. Stevens and 

Clemens 1993, Clemens and Watkins 2001). The major types of fluid-absent reactions depend on the 

protolith mineralogy and temperature. Notably, major crustal melting in peraluminous metasedimentary 

protoliths involves muscovite then biotite breakdown producing high-grade assemblages that commonly 

bear peritectic sillimanite, garnet, cordierite and orthopyroxene (e.g., Brown 2007, Taylor et al.  2014). 

These assemblages and the proportion of melt produced by those reactions depend on P-T conditions 

and protolith compositions, where different protholiths will produce different melt volumes (Brown 

2007, Korhonen et al. 2010). Predictive modeling of protolith fertility (Clemens and Vielzeuf 1987, 

Johannes and Holtz 1990) suggests that metagreywackes may represent the optimum rock compositions 

for high-scale granitic melt production, although pelites are also highly fertile (and may sometimes be 

more so than metagreywackes). Other rock-types, such as intermediate to felsic quartzofeldspathic rocks 

and mafic rocks, are far less fertile (Clemens 2006).

Many terrains that expose high-grade orogenic cores provide insights on crustal processes that 

occured in deep crustal levels of old large-scale orogenic belts. Some examples are: the Fosdick 

migmatite granite complex in West Antartica (e.g., Korhonen et al. 2010, 2012); the Round Hill, Broken 

Hill in southeastern Australia (e.g., White et al.  2004, White et al. 2005); the Ivrea Zone, Italy (Barboza 

and Bergantz 2000, Barboza et al. 1999, Redler et al. 2012); and the Southern Marginal Zone of the 

Limpopo Belt (e.g., Stevens &amp;amp; Van Reenen 1992, Nicoli et al.  2014, Taylor et al. 2014). In such terrains, 

determining the processes governing crustal anatexis, the P-T conditions and the timing of magmatic 

and metamorphic events may help elucidate the tectonic evolution of orogenic crust. This ultimately 

leads to a better understanding of Earth’s crustal evolution through time. 

One important segment in South America that still lacks detailed investigation is the core of the 

Araçuaí Orogen (AO), in Brazil, which formed as part of the Brasiliano-Pan African Orogenic System 

during the assembly of West Gondwana. The metamorphic core of the AO exposes a nearly continuous 

crustal section from mid-crustal anatectic migmatites and granulites in the southern part of the orogen 

to progressively shallow-level granitoid plutons and pegmatites towards the north (Pedrosa Soares et al. 

2011). Migmatites and granulites of the Nova Venecia Complex (NVC) are exposed through an 

extensive area of the AO and record different high-grade preserved mineral assemblages with little 

evidence for retrogression, which are exposed in close association with voluminous S-type and I-type 

granitoids. The sediments that formed the protoliths of the NVC are believed to have been eroded from 

a magmatic arc constructed in a pre-collisional stage of the orogen (ca. 630-585 Ma) and subsequently 

deposited in a back-arc region (Noce et al. 2004, Gradim et al. 2014). In a syn-collisional stage of the 

orogen (ca. 585-560 Ma), the rocks are believed to have been metamorphosed under high-grade 

conditions and their anatectic features are believed to be associated with the genesis of syn-collisional 

S-type granitoids, which have ages spanning from 585-560 Ma (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011, Roncato 

2009, Gradim 2013). Post-collisional I-type granitoids related to the tectonic collapse of the AO have 

been emplaced within all of these units, recording ages of ca. 500 Ma (Gradim et al. 2014). These late 

intrusions might have a link with late- to post-collisional fault zones that inverted and disrupted units 

across the orogen (Oyhantçabal 2011), causing the last (G5) thermal event recorded in the AO core (e.g. 

Alkmim et al.  2006, Roncato 2009). 

3.1 - MAIN GOALS 

This study uses field-based observations, textural and mineral chemistry analyses, U-Pb LA-

ICP-MS geochronology in zircon and monazite and pseudosection modeling in order to: 1) Constrain 

the P-T evolution of samples; 2) Determine the reason why the high-grade rocks record different 

preserved mineral assemblages; 3) Determine a possible source or different sources for high-grade 

metasedimentary samples using geochronology; 4) Correlate metamorphic events to intrusion of igneous

bodies occurring in close association with the sampled high-grade rocks.  

3.2 - RATIONALE 

Details of the metamorphic reactions that affected these rocks as well as the timing and extent 

of partial melting remain largely unknown. Specifically, it is not clear whether the age of peak 

metamorphic conditions coincide with main crystallization ages of granitoids emplaced in the high-

grade anatectic zone and very little has been documented about the effect caused by the post-collisional 

granitoids on all units.  

3.3 - LOCALITY AND MAIN ACCESS ROADS 

The Nova Venécia Complex lies approximately southwards from latitude 18°00’S, 

encompassing both the States of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. The field work in this study took 

place mostly in the region between the cities of Central de Minas, Nova Venécia, Baixo Guandú and 

Colatina. Table 1 shows the distance between the main cities within the studied area. Figure 1 shows the 

main roads from Ouro Preto - MG to the studied area and the main access roads in the area.

3.4 - METODOLOGY 

 Field work and sampling 

Field work took place in the States of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, Brazil, during two 

periods: (1) January 21 to 25 of 2012; and (2) May 27 to 29 of 2014. In both, the aim was to observe 

outcrop-scale features of the NVC, the relations between the high-grade rocks and the granitoids within 

the areas and to collect representative samples. Sample localities are indicated in Table 2. Figure 2 shows 

a map of the studied area and sampling sites (eight outcrops). Twenty-nine representative samples of 

different rock types were collected, namely: seven biotite-garnet metagreywacke (BGM) samples (4A1, 

4A2, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116); five cordierite granulites (CG) samples and one cordierite-garnet 

granulite (CGG) samples (3A1, 3A2, 3A3, 3A4, 3A5, FMC10); six biotite-garnet-orthopyroxene 

metagreywacke samples: 7A1A, 7A2A, 7A1B, 7A2B, 7C1, 7C2; and G2 and G3 granite samples: 5A, 5B,

 Microscopic petrography, whole-rock and trace element chemistry, mineral 

chemistry analysis, geochronology and metamorphic modeling 

Table 3 summarizes the methods used to study each of the samples. Whole rock chemistry was 

obtained for samples  3A1, 3A5, 3A4, 3A3 ,3A2, 7A2A, 7A1A, 7A1B, 7A2B, 113, 114, 112, 116, 111, 

4A2, 4A1, 102, 104, 103, 101, 7C1, 7C2, FMC10. Samples 101, 7A1B, 3A1, FMC10 were chosen for 

detailed study according to their petrographic aspects determined from thin sections and mineral 

assemblages recorded in each of them. Three samples (101, 7A1B and 3A1) were chosen that have good 

potential for metamorphic modelling based on their whole rock chemistry, mineral chemistry and 

observed microstuctures and textures. Samples chosen for geochronology are: 3A1, 101, 7A1B, 7B, 7B  

(zircon and monazite U-Pb LA-Q-ICP-MS) and sample 114 (U-Pb LA-ICP-MS in situ monazite 

analysis).  

Microscopic petrography 

Twenty-seven thin sections were made in the LAMIN (Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto). 

The thin sections were inspected for mineral paragenesis and textures in the rocks.  

  

Mineral chemistry analysis 

Mineral chemistry analysis was carried out at Stellenbosch University. Prior to imaging and 

analysis, the thin sections were carbon-coated. Samples were analyzed by a wavelength-dispersive X-

ray spectroscopy (EDS) using a Zeiss EVO MA 15 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) fitted with an 

Oxford Instrument Wave Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer and Oxford INCA Software. Beam conditions 

during the analysis were 20.00 kV and approximately 1.0 A, with a working distance of 8.5 mm and a 

specimen beam current of -20.00 nA. Analysis were quantified using natural mineral standards. Later 

on, mineral compositions were recalculated to mineral stoichiometries to obtain mineral structural 

formulae using the Software Excel 2010.  

Analysis was made on spots of interest with the aim to obtain mineral compositions that could 

be helpful in understanding the paragenesis and equilibria of stable assemblages in each sample. Figure 

3 shows four thin sections and the spots where mineral chemistry analysis was carried out.

Stellenbosch University, South Africa. Samples were crushed to a fine powder using a jaw crusher and 

swing mill, and glass disks prepared for XRF analysis using 1.5 g of high purity trace element and REE 

element free flux (LiBO2 = 80%, Li2B4O7 = 20%) mixed with 0.28 g of the rock sample. Whole-rock 

major element compositions were determined by XRF spectrometry on a Philips 1404Wavelength 

Dispersive spectrometer. The spectrometer is fitted with an Rh tube, analyzing crystals LIF200, LIF220, 

LIF420, PE, TLAP and PX1. The instrument is fitted with a gas-flow proportional counter, a scintillation 

detector. The gas-flow proportional counter uses a 90% Argon, 10% methane gas mixture. Major 

elements were analyzed on a fused glass disk at 50 kV and 50mA tube operating conditions. Matrix 

effects in the samples were corrected for by applying theoretical alpha factors and measured line overlap 

factors to the raw intensities measured with the SuperQ Philips software. Control standards that were 

used in the calibration procedures for major element analyses were AGV (Andesite from the United 

States Geological Survey, Reston), NIM-G (Granite from the Council for Mineral Technology, South 

Africa) and BHVO-1 (Basalt from the United States Geological Survey, Reston). 

Trace element chemistry was performed at the Central Analytical Facilities (CAF), Department 

of Earth Sciences, Stellenbosch University, South Africa. Trace element in bulk rock samples were 

analyzed on polished mounts prepared from XRF fusion disks. For laser ablation work, a Resonetics 

193nm Excimer laser was connected to an Agilent 7500 ICP-MS for the trace element analysis.  

U-Pb LA-Q-ICP-MS Geochronology 

Samples were prepared in the “Laboratório de Preparação de Amostras para Geoquímica e 

Geocronologia” (LOPAG), in the Department of Geology of the University of Ouro Preto. Zircons and 

monazites were separated from the chosen samples (3A1, 7A1B, 7B, 7D, 101) by rock crushing, 

concentration of heavy minerals (heavy liquid separation), magnetic separation and individual selection 

and handpicking of grains with the use of a petrographic binocular. The grains were subsequently 

mounted on an acrylic plate covered with a double-face tape where collected grains were disposed in 

lines, so each of the lines represented one distinct sample. A mixture of resin and a hardening solution 

was added to a mold that was put over the tape, which produced mounts (2.5x1 cm). The mounts were 

polished until zircon and monazite grains were exposed to half thickness. Cathodoluminescence images 

were produced in the Department of Geology from the University of São Paulo. 

The analysis was carried out using the LA-Q-ICP-MS (Mass spectrometry plasma coupling 

ionization laser ablation) method. The system is composed of a laser (New Wave UP-213) coupled with 

a mass spectrometer with a quadrupole mass analyzer (Agilent 7700x). The spots diameters were 

between 30 µm and the ablation time interval was 40 seconds. Data was reduced by using the Software 

Glitter (GEMOC Laser ICP-MS Total Trace Element Reduction). This software allows for an interactive 

selection of background and time-signal intervals from ICP-MS analysis. Figure 4 shows zircon images

from all samples, as well as some ages obtained on the indicated spots. 

U-Pb LA-ICP-MS in-situ monazite dating 

Monazite grains were dated in thin section in the Stellenbosch University Central analytical 

facility (CAF) ICP-MS unit using an Agilent 7500ce quadrupole ICP-MS coupled to a 213 nm New 

Wave laser. Prior to analysis monazite grains were imaged in BSE (back-scattered electron) mode using 

a ZEISS EVO MA15VP SEM housed in the Central Analytical Facility (CAF) electron micro-beam 

unit. Operating conditions for monazite are described in Buick et al. (2011) and were optimised to 

provide maximum sensitivity for the high masses (Pb–U) while inhibiting oxide formation 

(ThO+/Th+&lt;0.5%). Ablations occurred in a custom-built small-volume, teardrop-shaped sample cell 

(cf. Horstwood et al. 2003) in a He carrier gas, and the resulting aerosol was mixed with Ar prior to 

introduction into the ICP-MS via a signal-smoothing manifold. Initial data reduction used the Glitter 

software package (van Achterbergh et al. 2001) to calculate the relevant isotopic ratios (207Pb/206Pb, 

208Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/232Th, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U). 235U was calculated from 238U counts via the natural 

abundance ratio 235U = 238U/137.88 (Jackson et al. 2004). Individual isotopic ratios were displayed in 

time-resolved mode. Isotopic ratios generated during the first 5-10s of each analysis were not used, and 

from the remainder of each analysis the integration window was chosen so as to maximise concordance 

(Jackson et al. 2004). Ablation depth-dependent elemental fractionation was corrected for by tying the 

integration window for the unknown monazite to the identical integration window of the standard 

(Jackson et al.  2004). 

Instrumental drift was corrected against the monazite standard using linear interpolative fits. 

The U-Pb data were plotted on a Wetherill concordia diagram using the software Isoplot (Ludwig 2003). 

Uncertainties in these Tables were propagated assuming a 1% uncertainty on the age of the standards. 

204Pb-based common Pb corrections were not applied because of the well-known contamination of the 

carrier gases by 204Hg (e.g. Jackson et al. 2004). 

The analytical runs involved repeated analysis cycles of the USGS 46609 standard (424.9 Ma; 

Aleinikoff et al. 2006), used as the primary standard, Thompson Mine monazite (1766 Ma; Williams et 

al. 1996), used as a control/secondary standard, and 6-8 analyses of monazite from the thin section. 

Integration times for U/Pb age determinations were 15 ms for 206Pb, 40 ms for 207Pb, and 10 ms for 208Pb, 

204Pb, 232Th and 238U. LA-ICP-MS acquisitions consisted of a 60 second measurement of the gas blank, 

followed by 40 seconds of measurement of U, Th and Pb signals during ablation. Laser ablations were 

performed at a frequency of 4 Hz and an energy density of ~4.5-5 J/cm2, and produced 20 nm diameter 

wide pits. As noted by Buick et al. (2011), a problem with U/Pb analysis of monazite at Stellenbosch 

University using the above set-up is a matrix affect that occurs when the low-Th Palaeozoic 46609 

monazite standard is used to date older (Mesoprotoerozoic and older) monazite. The LA-ICP-MS U-Pb

15 

isotope analyses of the old monazite are reversely discordant, even when independent TIMS analyses 

show that this monazite is concordant. This was the case in the present study where analyses of the 

nominally concordant high-Th Thompson Mine secondary standard were 7-13% reversely discordant. 

However, as noted by Buick et al. (2011) the weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of the monazite is 

unaffected. This was found to be the case in the, present study, where the weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age 

of 9 analyses of the Thompson Mine monazite was 1753±17 Ma (95% confidence level, or c.l.; MSWD 

= 0.57), within error of the accepted value. 

From DF20912-1 (sample 114), 16 LA-ICP-MS analyses were made in thin section. 

Unfortunately, 7 of these were apatite inclusions, rather than monazite. Of the remaining 9 analyses all 

were concordant (98-100% based on the agreement between 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U ages), but not all 

were the same age. Two concordant analyses had apparent spot 206Pb/238U ages  of  c. 550 Ma (analyses 

MNZ_6  and _9). The remaining seven analyses were younger and could be combined  together to  yield 

a concordia age of 502.1 ± 6.3 Ma (2sigma; MSWD of concordance and equivalence  = 0.51) 

Metamorphic Modelling 

Constraining metamorphic conditions and evaluating the relation between mineral assemblage 

stability and melting is crucial to determine the nature of the two metapelites regarding to one another 

and to the granites in the studied area. The use of equilibrium phase diagrams constructed within the 

confines of a specific bulk rock composition, i.e. pseudosections (Powell et al. 1998), is a powerful 

approach to evaluate this relationship. The metamorphic conditions in peak and preserved assemblages 

in three samples of the NVC were investigated using numerous quantitative T-MFe2O3, T-MH2O, T- MMelt, 

P- MMelt and P-T pseudosections. Calculations were undertaken in the chemical system Na2O–CaO–

K2O–FeO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2–H2O–TiO2–Fe2O3 (NCKFMASHTO) using THERIAK-DOMINO 

software (de Capitani &amp;amp; Petrakakis 2010), in combination with the up-dated Holland &amp;amp; Powell (1998) 

dataset. The modelling uses the a-x relationships of White et al. (2007) for silicate melt; White et al. 

(2002) for orthopyroxene, spinel and magnetite; Holland &amp;amp; Powell (2003) for K-feldspar and 

plagioclase; White et al. (2000, 2005) for ilmenite; White et al. (2005) for garnet and biotite; Holland 

and Powell (1998) for cordierite. The dataset was compiled for Theriak-Domino by Doug Tinkham.

CHAPTER 2  

GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE ARAÇUAÍ OROGEN 

The Brasiliano-Pan African amalgamation of West Gondwana generated a complex and large 

orogenic system limited by the São Francisco, Paranapanema and Rio de la Plata cratons to the west and 

the Congo and Kalahari cratons to the east. To the south of the São Francisco and Congo crations, the 

complementary orogenic segments that are exposed today in east South America and west Africa are: 

the Araçuaí Orogen, the Ribeira Fold Belt (RFB) and the Dom Feliciano Belt (DFB) in Brazil and 

Uruguay (Mantiqueira Province); and the West-Congo Belt, the Kaoko Belt, the Damara Belt and the 

Gariep Belt in Africa. These orogenic segments were amalgamated in the Neoproterozoic-Lower 

Paleozoic during the closure of the Adamastor Ocean (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1998) and Khomas Ocean 

(Gray et al. 2008) and posteriorly separated by the Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting. Prior to this rifting, 

it is suggested that the São Francisco and Congo Cratons had remained connected since the Amazonian-

Eburnian Cycle (2300-1900 Ma) by the so-called Bahia-Gabão Bridge (Porada 1989). This indicates 

that the Araçuaí-West Congo segment was formed as a confined orogenic system inside a gulf of the 

Adamastor Ocean, limited by the São Francisco-Congo craton to the north, east and west (Pedrosa-

Soares et al. 2001). Figure 4 shows the location of the Araçuaí-West Congo Orogen, which is today 

exposed in Brazil and Africa, limited by the São Francisco and Congo Cratons.

2.1 - STRATIGRAPHY 

Figure 5 shows a regional map of the Araçuaí Orogen. The evolution of the AO is recorded by 

major lithostratigraphic units that compose this system, from the basement and rift events to the 

plutonism and metamorphism that mark the orogenic Brasiliano-Pan African event.  

 

Figure 5- Regional map of the Araçuaí Orogen (modified from Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007) and the study area. 

 The basement 

Essentially, the basement encompasses the Guanhães, Gouveia, Porteirinha, Mantiqueira and 

Juiz de Fora Complexes, as defined by Noce et al. (2007). They constitute segments of a Rhyacian 

orogen that record evolution between 2.2 and 2.05 Ma and reworking in the Brasiliano orogeny. The 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

19 

Guanhães, Gouveia, Porteirinha, Mantiqueira are autochthonous to para-autochthonous segments while 

the Juiz de Fora Complex is juxtaposed to the Mantiqueira Complex by an extense shear zone (the Abre 

Campo Fault; Noce et al. 2007). 

The Guanhães, Porteirinha and Gouveia include tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) 

gneisses and migmatites, granitic plutons and greenstone belt sequences that are similar to the 

Quadrilátero Ferrífero basement, although there is a mismatch among their ages (Noce et al. 2007). In 

the Guanhães Complex, TTG gneisses and migmatites yield ages of ca. 2.867 and 2711 Ma and a granitic 

intrusion yield an age of 2710 Ma (Silva et al. 2002).  In the Gouveia Complex, a greenstone belt 

sequence and a granitic pluton yield ages of 2971 and 2839 Ma (Machado et al. 1989), respectively. U-

Pb data for the Porteirinha Complex is currently unavailable. In the Mantiqueira Complex, the 

characteristic orthogneisses yield magmatic crystallization ages of 2180 to 2041 Ma (Silva et al. 2002, 

Noce et al. 2007). Sr and Nd data suggest melting of an ancient crustal segment, which is infered to 

represent a magmatic arc(s) developed around an Archean paleocontinent margin (Noce et al. 2007). 

On the other hand, the Juiz de Fora Complex seems to record the development of an intra-ocean 

magmatic arc, with isotopic signature that suggests melting of a juvenile crust and magmatic 

crystallization at ca. 2134 and 2084 Ma (e.g. Heilbron et al. 2001, Noce et al. 2007). 

 Rift-related rock-types 

According to Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Alkmim et al. (2011), the Araçuaí-West Congo orogeny was 

preceded by at least six events of rifting and-or anorogenic magmatism, namely: the Statherian E1 (1.77-

1.7 Ga), Calymmian E2 (1.57-1.5 Ga), Early Stenian E3 (1.18 - ? Ga), Stenian-Tonian E4 (ca. 1 Ga), 

Tonian E5 (930-850 Ma) and Cryogenian E6 (750-670 Ga) events. Until now, the records of events E1, 

E2, and E3 were only found in the Araçuaí Orogen. The E1 event is recorded in the 

Paleo/Mesoproterozoic plutonic, volcanic and sedimentary basal section of the Espinhaço Supergroup 

and in the Borrachudos (Guanhães Complex) and Lagoa Real Suites. The Borrachudos Suite have an 

age of 1.740±8 a 1.670±32 Ga (Silva et al. 2002). The E2 event is recorded in the northern Espinhaço 

and Chapada Diamantina by sediments and volcanics of the middle portion of the Espinhaço 

Supergroup. The E3 event is recorded in the syn-rift deposition of the Sopa-Brumadinho Formation, in 

the Espinhaço Supergroup. The E4 event is represented by the anorogenic Noqui granites (ca. 999 ± 7 

Ma; Africa) and related volcanic rocks, which can be correlated to to mafic dykes in southern Bahia 

State (Brazil). The E5 (Tonian rift) event is representd by: the thick bimodal volcanic pile of The 

Zadinian and Mayumbian groups in the West Congo Belt; and by the A-type Salto da Divisa (Silva et 

al. 2008), Tonian mafic dykes (e.g. Pedro Lessa Suite) and the pre-glacial formations of the Macaúbas 

basin in the Araçuaí Oorgen and São Francisco craton. The records of the Cryogenian E6 event, which 

evolved to oceanic spreading in the Central–southern Macaúbas basin, include: the Southern Bahia 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

20 

alkaline Province (ca. 735-675 Ma, Brazil, Rosa et. al 2007), the deposition of diamictites formations of 

the Macaúbas Group, and possibly the La Louilla felsic volcanism in SW Gabon. All these rifting events 

were unsuccessful in splitting the São Francisco-Congo craton. This cratonic segment remained 

connected since the Amazonian-Eburnian Cycle (2300-1900 Ma) by the so-called Bahia-Gabão Bridge 

(Porada 1989) and was only split by the Cretaceous Atlantic rifting.  

 Macaúbas Group and correlative units 

The Macaúbas Basin is the precursor Neoproterozoic basin of the Araçuaí Orogen, which 

evolved mainly from a Cryogenian continental rift (E6 event) to an inland-sea basin (Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; 

Akmim 2011). The basin, which was partially floored by a Cryogenian oceanic crust, was inverted 

during the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano-Pan African orogeny. The rocks within this basin sector include 

the remnants of Neoproterozoic oceanic lithosphere (660 Ma, Queiroga et al. 2007) and the thick 

Macaúbas Group that includes rift, transitional and passive margin sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive 

rocks with late Tonian to Cryogenian ages (Silva et al. 2008, Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2008, 2011). 

 Accretionary wedge 

 A suture related accretionary wedge was characterized in the region of São José da Safira, west 

of the Rio Doce magmatic arc, by Peixoto et al. (2015). The suture zone consist of a 30km-wide and 

100 km-long complex schist belt. It includes pelitic schist intercalated with quartzites, metaultramafic 

schists and diopsidites, intruded by collisional granites. The belt is limited to the west by the Guanhães 

Block and to the east by the Rio Doce arc. It presents the architecture of an asymmetric flower structure 

developed in a transpressional regime and a Barrovian-type metamorphic zoning. Detrital zircon data 

from a lower succession point to maximum depositional ages similar to passive deposits of the precursor 

basin (Macaúbas; ca. 819 Ma). Detrital ages obtained from an upper succession indicate main 

provenance from the Rio Doce arc (ca. 600 Ma). A metamorphic age of 560 ± 20 Ma was obtained for 

the sheared top of the basement and a crystallization age of 544 ± 10 was obtained for the intrusive Santa 

Rosa granite, which are both interpreted to represent the syn-collisional stage of the Brasiliano orogeny. 

This led to the suggestion by Peixoto et al. (2015) that the basin closure during the assembly of Western 

Gondwanaland lasted close to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, i.e. approximately 20 Ma later than 

previously suggested. 

 Granitoids 

The voluminous granitoid plutons in the core of the Araçuaí Orogen had been grouped into five 

main Supersuites (G1 to G5) according to their chemistry and tectonic history, with ages spanning from 

630 to 480 Ma. The G1 Supersuite encompasses pre-collisional arc-related I-type rocks that range in 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

21 

age from 630-580 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2011). The G2 Supersuite comprises S-type 

granitoids that crystallized and were deformed during a syn-collisional stage of the Brasiliano orogeny 

that have ages of 585-560 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2011). S-Type G3 granitoids were formed in 

a late to post-collisional stage of the Araçuaí orogeny (545-520 Ma; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2011). 

S-type G4 granitoids (535-500 Ma) and I-type G5 granitoids (520-480 Ma) were formed during a post-

collisional stage of the orogeny and represent the lateral scape of the southern segment and the 

gravitational collapse of the AO (Alkmim et al. 2006, Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2011). 

 Jequitinhonha and Nova Venécia Complex 

The Jequitinhonha and Nova Venécia are paragneiss complexes that border the eastern limits of 

the Araçuaí Orogen from north to south, respectively. It is believed that the protoliths of the Nova 

Venécia Complex have been deposited in a barc-arc basin, whereas the Jequitinhonha Complex records 

a distal passive margin sedimentation that would be correlative to post-glacial Macaúbas sequences 

(Noce 2004, Gradim 2013, Vieira 2007, Gonçalves-Dias et al. 2011). 

The Jequitinhonha Complex is located in the northeast portion of the Minas Gerais State, Brazil. 

It consists of peraluminous kinzigitic migmatitic paragneisses intercalated with quartzite, graphite 

gneiss and calcsilicate rocks. Detrital zircon ages indicate provenance from: the São Francisco-Congo 

Craton basement; the Espinhaço-Chapada Diamantina; and the rift-related rocks from Noqui-Zadinian-

Mayumbian-Salto da Divisa rift system. The Jequitinhonha Complex is interpreted as a passive margin 

deposit of the precursor basin of the Araçuaí Orogen, younger than the glaciation recorded in the 

Macaúbas Group (Gonçalves-Dias et al. 2011). 

Silva et al. (1987) first included the Nova Venécia Complex as part of a larger complex, known 

as Paraíba do Sul, which was interpreted as a volcano-sedimentary migmatitic and granitic Proterozoic 

sequence (Féboli 1993a, 1993b). Tuller (1993) divided this complex into a proximal, an intermediary 

and a distal marine domain. The first one (to the west) would comprise aluminous gneisses, quartzites 

and calc-silicate rocks. The second one comprised marble and amphibolitic sequences, which was 

interpreted to represent a relative proximity to a basic magmatic source (Signorelli 1993). The third one 

(to the east) consisted of major aluminous gneisses and calc-silicate rocks, with minor quartzite and 

amphibolites. This distal domain was denominated Nova Venécia Complex by Pedrosa-Soares et al. 

(2006). The NVC comprises migmatitic and granulitic paragneisses rich in biotite, garnet, cordierite 

and/or sillimanite, and calc-silicate rocks (Roncato 2009). Detrital zircons in these rocks yield ages of 

631±19 Ma (Noce et al. 2004), 608 ±18 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2008) and ca. 590 Ma (Gradim 

2013), which constrain the range of maximum depositional age for the Nova Venécia Complex.

 Salinas Formation 

The Salinas Formation is a metasedimentary unit comprising meta-arenites, metapelites and 

metaconglomerates metamorphosed under greenschist to amphibolite conditions. This unit lies 

discordantly onto the Macaúbas Group, to the west, and is intruded by Neoproterozoic and Cambrian 

granites, to the east. It records the development of a syn-orogenic basin (flysch) between a passive 

margin and an orogenic front (Santos et al. 2009). 

2.2 - ANATOMY OF THE ARAÇUAÍ-WEST CONGO OROGEN 

There are nine main structural domains in the Araçuai West Congo Orogen that differ from each 

other in terms of style, orientation, deformation history and shear sense (Figure 6). They have been 

described by Alkmim et al. (2006), based on a synthesis from numerous individual studies, and represent 

an image of the general kinematic that took place during the Brasiliano Pan-African Orogeny.  

 The Serra do Espinhaço Fold-Thrust Belt 

It encompasses the Archean basement and units from the Espinhaço Supergroup and Macaúbas 

Group. This domains consists of a 700 km west verging fold-thrust belt bordering the eastern limits of 

the São Francisco Craton. 

 The Chapada Acauã shear zone 

Chapada Acauã is a 50 km wide x 150 km long plateau that lies on the east side of the Serra do 

Espinhaço. The rocks that underlie this plateau comprise the hanging wall of a regional east-dipping 

shear zone, the Chapada Acauã Shear Zone (CASZ; Marshak et al. 2006). 

 The Minas Novas corridor 

This domain is characterized as a 30 km wide and 150 km long dextral strike-slip shear zone 

that cuts Macaúbas Group metapelites. 

 The Rio Pardo salient 

This salient was traced out by the internal trend-lines of the Serra do Espinhaço fold-thrust belt 

in a regional-scale convex-to-the-foreland curve (Cruz and Alkmim 2006). It involves rocks within the 

Espinhaço Supergroup and the Macaúbas Group. 

 The Paramirim aulacogen 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

23 

This domain presents a NNW trend marking the limit between the northeast and the southeast 

lobe of the São Francisco Craton. The structure was initially formed by the Espinhaço rifting event and 

reactivated during the Macaúbas rifting event. Subsequently, the segment was partially inverted during 

the Brasiliano Pan African Orogeny (Danderfer e Dardenne 2002). 

 The Guanhães Basement Block 

The Guanhães Block is exposed southeast of the Serra do Espinhaço fold-thrust belt. It consists 

of Archean TTG gneisses, migmatites that have ages ranging from 2.8 – 2.7 Ma (Silva et al. 2002). 

Northwards, a shallowly dipping shear zone juxtaposes Macaúbas Group strata onto the Guanhães 

basement, recording reverse-sinistral and normal-dextral distinct phase motions (Peres et al. 2004). The 

west margin of the Block is a foreland-(west)-verging thrust, where the Guanhães basement lies onto 

the Espinhaço Supergroup strata. In the southeastern margin of the Guanhães Block, the Dom Silvério 

shear zone juxtaposes Rio Doce metapelites to the east against the basement to the west. 

 The Dom Silvério shear zone and adjacent structures 

The Dom Silvério shear zone is a 100 km long, 4 km wide, steeply dipping belt of mylonitic 

rock that terminates against the dextral strike-slip Abre Campo shear zone at its northern end. The shear 

zone has a NNE-trending and a dominantly sinistral motion (Peres et al. 2004). 

 The Itapebi shear zone 

The Itapebi is a NW-trending shear zone that is characteristic of an overall dextral transpressive 

system at the northern edge of the Araçuaí Orogen. It affects the Archean basement, the Salto da Divisa 

Suite and the Jequitinhonha Complex. 

 The High grade internal zone 

The high grade internal zone comprises the granite Supersuites (G1 to G5) and the paragneisses 

complexes (Jequitinhonha and Nova Venécia complexes). This internal zone consists of two distinct 

sub-domains, from a structural standpoint. The northern one contains west- and east- verging thrust 

sense shear zones, whereas the southern subdomain contains a system of dextral-transpressional shear 

zones. One of the most representative of these shear zones is known as Abre Campo shear zone, a major 

geophysical and structural discontinuity that can be traced for 300 km. It is interpreted to represent either 

a Paleoproterozoic suture (Cunningham et al. 1998; Brueckner et al. 2000) or a Brasiliano suture 

developed during closure of the oceanic portion of the Macaúbas basin (e.g. Peixoto et al. 2015). The 

first hypothesis is supported by the fact that the shear zone is the boundary between two categories of 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

24 

basement: the Archean Mantiqueira Complex and the Paleoproterozoic Juiz de Fora Complex, 

metamorphosed in amphibolite and granulite facies, respectively. Support for the second proposal comes 

from the fact that the Neoproterozoic Rio Doce arc occurs just to the east of the Abre Campo shear zone, 

south of 18°S latitude. 

 The West Congo Belt 

The Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting split the AWCO into the Araçuaí Orogen in Brazil and its 

complimentary part in West Africa (Gabon, Congo and Angola), the West Congo Belt. The West Congo 

Belt is a single NW-trending and ENE-verging fold-thrust belt that borders the west margin of the Congo 

craton (Alkmim et al. 2006). It includes thrust slices of Archean and Paleoproterozoic basement, as well 

as a thick pile of Neoproterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary units (Alkmim et al. 2006). 

 

Figure 6- The main structural domains in the Araçuaí-West Congo Orogen: 1) the Serra do Espinhaço Fold-Thrust 

Belt; 2) the Chapada Acauã shear zone; 3) the Minas Novas Corridor; 4) the Rio Pardo Salient; 5) the Guanhães 

Basement Block; 6) the Dom Silvério shear zone; 7) the Itabepi shear zone; 8) the high-grade internal zone; and 

9) the West Congo Belt. Modified from Alkmim et al. (2007). 

2.3 - THE HIGH GRADE ANATECTIC AND CRYSTALLINE CORE OF THE 

OROGEN 

The study area within the NVC is inserted in the high grade zone of the Araçuaí Orogen, 

comprising metasedimentary and arc-related rocks, including pre- to post-collisional granitoids. The 

relevant units for this study are: (1) the Rio Doce Group, comprising an arc-related metavolcano-

sedimentary sequency (Vieira 2007, Peixoto et el. 2015); (2) the Nova Venécia Complex, which consists 

of migmatitic and granulitic metasedimentary rocks whose protoliths have been deposited in back-arc 

basin (Gradim et al. 2014); and (3) Granitoid Supersuites G1 (arc-related pre-collisional granitogenesis), 

G2 (syn-collisional granitogenesis), G3 (late to post-collisional granitogenesis), G4 (post-collisional 

granitogenesis) and G5 (post-collisional granitogenesis). 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

25 

 The Rio Doce Group 

The Rio Doce Group records components of a volcano-plutonic-sedimentary system, accreted 

to an active continental margin during a pre-collisional stage of the Araçuaí West-Congo Orogen (ca. 

630-585 Ma; Vieira 2007). According to Vieira (2007), field and geographic relations and geochemical 

similarities between the metavolcanic rocks of the Rio Doce Group and the G1 Supersuite indicate that 

the former unit represents the upper-crustal section of the Araçuaí Orogen and the latter the plutonic 

segment of the AO magmatic arc. One of the basins related to this arc would have evolved to form the 

Nova Venécia Complex. Figure 9 shows a model of a paleogeographic profile reconstruction of these 

units. From base to top, the Rio Doce Group comprises the Tumiritinga (mica-schist, gneiss and 

volcanoclastic rocks), São Tomé (metagraywacke, mica-schist and meta-dacite), Palmital do Sul (mica-

schist and gneiss) and the João Pinto (quartzite) Formations. The following description of these units is 

based on Vieira (2007).  

The Palmital do Sul Formation is composed by schists and gneisses containing minor lenses of 

quartzite and calc-silicate rocks. The first metavolcanic rock ever observed in the Rio Doce Group lies 

intercalated with schists within this formation (Vieira 2007). From compositions and textural 

observations, this rock is classified as a dacitic tuff (metapyroclastic rock). The pyroclastic rocks yield 

ages of ca. 585 Ma. 

The Tumiritinga Formation consists of schists intercaled with calc-silicate rocks and of  

metavolcanoclastic rocks. P-T quantitative estimations in two samples using THERMOCALC show 

values of T = 468 ± 50 ºC; P = 4,96 ± 1 kb and T = 638 ± 76 ºC; P =4,56 ± 1 kb. That constrains 

metamorphic conditions from green-schist/amphibolite transition to upper amphibolite facies 

(Castañeda et al. 2007). The protoliths of the schists are interpreted to be graywacke pelites, which 

suggests a source with granodiorite-tonalite-diorite composition. It is suggested that the 

metavolcanoclastic rocks represents a marine distal deposition in relation to the metapyroclastic rock in 

the Palmital do Sul Formation. Yet, both formations would be correlatives, as their rocks yield 

approximately the same ages (ca. 585 Ma).  

The São Tomé Formation are non-anatectic rocks consisting of schists with variable amounts of 

quartz, mica and plagioclase. The protoliths of this rocks have been deposited in a marine environment 

(deep continental shelf to slope), with deposition controlled by the magmatic arc. U-Pb TIMS detrital 

zircon analysis yield ages of ca. 594 Ma in arenites within this unit. This age differs from the maximum

Ma, but it is in agreement with the youngest range in ages for sedimentary sources of the NVC suggested 

by Gradim et al. (2014) from 641 to 590 Ma. Vieira (2007) suggests that the NVC underlies the São

Tomé Formation.  

The João Pinto Formation consists of pure, micaceuous and/or feldspatic quartzite. Its protoliths 

are interpreted to be quartz-arenites with small clay fractions. The mature sedimentary strata from this 

formation covers the arc-related volcanic-sedimentary strata from all other formations in the Rio Doce 

Group.

 The Nova Venécia Complex 

The NVC consists essentially of peraluminous migmatites, granulites and of calc-silicate rocks 

(Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). The main rock-types in the NVC are cordierite-rich granulites and biotite 

+ garnet ± cordierite ± orthopyroxene ± sillimanite migmatitic paragneisses that record a foliation 

developed during the main ductile deformation (Roncato 2009, Gradim 2013). Three main field relations 

between the NVC and other units within the AO core are reported: (1) A transitional contact observed 

between biotite-garnet gneisses (NVC) and the Ataléia granitic Suite (G2 Supersuite) is interpreted to 

reveal anatexis increase in biotite-garnet gnaisses from granite-free sites to granitic sites (i.e. Ataléia 

Suite) bearing calc-silicate and gneiss xenoliths (Roncato 2009); (2) The NVC is interpreted to represent 

a roof-pendant in relation to the Carlos Chagas Batolith (G2 Supersuite) northwest from the area in his 

study (Roncato 2009); and (3) I-type post-collisional plutons (G5 Supersuite) intrude the NVC and all 

other units in the study area (e.g., Gradim et al. 2014). 

The NVC high-grade rocks have a foliation parallel to the migmatitic layers, being syn-

cinematic to the main ductile regional deformation (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). Most commonly, 

migmatitic structures within these rocks are stromatic, but flebitic, folded and ptigmatic structures are 

also observed. Biotite-garnet gneiss neossomes occur as biotite-free, garnet-rich, quartz-feldspar

27 

leucossomes. Mesossome and melanossome layers/schlieren are composed of biotite, feldspar, quartz, 

garnet, cordierite, sillimanite and/or hercynite. Restitic rocks are considered to be sillimanite-cordierite-

garnet-biotite gneisses, spinel-sillimanite-cordierite-biotite gneisses, cordierite granulite and calc-

silicate rocks (interpreted to truly represent the paleossome; Roncato 2009). All anatectic processes are 

believed to relate to syn-collisional granitogenesis and generation of the G2 Supersuite (e.g. Ataléia 

Suite) (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, Gradim 2013). 

Altough there is a lack of more detailed studies on the NVC metamorphism, some studies report 

that the paragneisses were metamorphosed under high-grade conditions, reaching high amphibolite 

facies to granulite facies (Table 4; e.g. Munhá et al. 2005, Gradim 2013). Qualitative estimations from 

the paragenesis Qtz+Pl+Kfs+Bt+Sil+Grt+Crd±Opx, Qtz+Pl+Kfs+Bt+Sil+Grt+Crd±Opx, 

Qtz+Pl+Kfs+Bt+Crd±Sp, Qtz+Pl+Kfs+Bt+Sil+Grt+Crd+Sp±Opx (for biotite-garnet gneisses) and 

Qtz+Kfs+Pl+Crd+Bt±Sil±Sp (for cordierite granulites) point to metamorphism under amphibolite to 

granulite facies transition. P-T conditions estimated from semi-quantitative thermobarometry using 

those assemblages are 5 to 6.1 kbar and 712º to 930º C (Gradim 2013). Munhá et al. (2005) suggests 

that the maximum P-T metamorphic conditions were 6.5 ± 0.5 kbar, 820 ± 30 ºC. The suggested age of 

peak metamorphism in the NVC is 575 Ma, according to Söllner et al. (2000), de Campos et al. (2004) 

and Gradim et al. (2014). In the northern Rio de Janeiro State (RFB), Bento dos Santos et al. (2011) 

suggested peak metamorphism for high-grade rocks at 850 ± 50?C and 8 ± 1 kbar, occurring 

simultaneously to the formation of high-temperature deep thrusts and shear zones, followed by 

clockwise P-T-t retrograde path with cooling and decompression to ca. 500°C and 5 kbar.

Gradim (2013) and Gradim et al. (2014) suggest that the NVC protoliths were greywacke 

sediments enriched with a peraluminous pelitic fraction and plagioclase. Geochemical signatures 

reported in studies from Vieira (2007), Pedrosa Soares et al. (2008) and Roncato (2009) indicate that 

those protoliths have been deposited in a backarc region. U-Pb detrital zircon ages from the NVC 

corroborates that proposition, considering that the pre-collisional stage of the AO (630 to 585 Ma) 

encompasses the presumably arc-related G1 plutonism (e.g., Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). Noce et al. 

(2004) dated paragneiss samples providing protolith ages for the NVC: 631 ± 19 Ma (maximum

sedimentation age) and 774 ± 13 Ma, 2104 ± 12 Ma (other sources). Gradim et al. (2014) constrains the 

maximum depositional age range for the NVC from 590 to 641 Ma and other sources at 733-810 Ma, 

901 Ma and 2086-2124 Ma. 

  Granitoid Supersuites 

Several studies present relevant data on the petrology, structural geology, geochemistry and 

geochronology of the granitic magmatism in the Araçuaí Orogen, bringing many new insights on the 

evolution of the orogeny. Inicially, plutonism in the orogen was divided into six main suites: G1, G2, 

G3S, G3I, G4 e G5 (Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1999, 2001; 

Silva et al. 2005). De Campos et al. (2004) and Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2006) regrouped those suites into 

G1, G2, G3, G4 e G5. Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2011) suggested a substitution from the term Suite to 

Supersuite according to the specific geotectonic significance of each group of granitoids. According to 

Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2011), this would avoid confusion arising from the innumerous names given 

locally to batoliths and small granitic bodies. The main characteristics of the granitic magmatism of the 

Araçuaí orogen and its genesis is synthesized in Table 5. 

The G1 Supersuite 

 Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2007) suggest that the magmatic arc of the Araçuaí-West Congo Orogen 

is represented by the volcanic rocks within the Rio Doce Group and by the plutonic G1 Supersuite. 

Therefore, the G1 Supersuite is interpreted to have formed during a pre-collisional stage of the Araçuaí 

orogeny, from 630-585 Ma (Table 6; Pedrosa-Sares et al 2007, 2011). It consists of calc-alkaline, 

metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, I-type granitoids that evolved during the pre-collisional stage 

of the Araçuaí Orogen (Noce et al. 2000a). Litogeochemistry and isotopic data (Nd epsilon between -5 

and -13, and TDM between 1,2 e 2,2 Ga) suggest that G1 is an expanded calc-alkaline suite, representing 

a magmatic arc in an active continental margin, with hybrid geochemical signature and predominant 

contribution from crust over mantle (Nalini 2000, Noce et al. 2000b, Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-

Leonardos 2000). The G1 batholiths and stocks are mainly tonalities and granodiorites, with minor 

dioritic and mafic facies bearing xenoliths of metassedimentary rocks. They record a regional foliation 

(many times mylonitic) imprinted in a collisional stage of the orogeny.  

The G1 Supersuite encompasses numerous plutons locally known as: Alto Capim, Brasilândia, 

Cuité Velho, Derribadinha, Divino, Estrela-Muniz Freire, Galiléia, Guarataia, Manhuaçu, Mascarenhas-

Baixo Guandu, Muriaé, São Vitor, Teófilo Otoni, Valentim, Rancho Alegre e Topázio (Pedrosa-Soares 

&amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, 2011; Vieira 2007; Novo 2013).

The G2 Supersuite  

The G2 Supersuite is interpreted to have formed from 585-560 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 

2011) in a syn-collisional stage of the Araçuaí orogeny. It consists mainly of foliated S-type batholiths 

of subalkaline to calc-alkaline granites, with ubiquitous remnants of banded paragneisses and 

migmatites, according to Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2001). Locally, some portions of large batholiths do not 

contain a syn-tectonic foliation (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). The G2 Supersuite is composed of Suites 

such as Carlos Chagas, Ataléia and Montanha, the two former are observed within the study area. Table 

7 summarizes the ages of the G2 Supersuite obtained from literature. 

Pinto et al. (2001) interpreted the Ataléia Granite and Carlos Chagas Leucogranite as the 

granitoids generated in a syn-tectonic setting. According to them, the Ataléia unit consists of fine to 

medium-grained foliated biotite-granite and garnet-biotite-granite, rich in xenoliths and paragneiss 

restites and calcsilicate rocks. According to Roncato (2009), the Ataléia Suite consists essentially of 

quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar (orthoclase and microcline) and biotite. Garnet is ubiquitous, locally 

representing &gt;5% in volume of the rock. Other accessory minerals are sillimanite, hercynite, apatite, 

monazite, orthopyroxene, cordierite, zircon, ilmenite, sulfide, magnetite and rare titanite. Roncato 

(2009) points out that the Ataléia Suite is always spatially associated with the Nova Venécia Complex. 

The NVC would gradationally evolve to the Ataléia Suite, in a process involving metatexites gradating 

to diatexites and finally to Ataléia bodies. Tuller (1997) describes field relations between Ataléia 

granites, Carlos Chagas leucogranites and paragneisses (correlated to the NVC) as gradational, although 

locally these contacts could be tectonic (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). At least part of the anatectic process 

that generated migmatites would be syn-kinematic to the main foliation in the Ataléia Suite, which 

would result from the high-grade regional metamorphism affecting the Nova Venécia Complex.  

The Carlos Chagas Leucogranite was described as foliated and folded leucocratic, coarse-

grained, granitic bodies marked by augen feldspar crystals by Pinto et al. (2001). Pedrosa-Soares et al. 

(2006) define the Carlos Chagas Suite as an S-type leucocratic granitic unit containing ubiquitous garnet 

and biotite, where metasedimentary xenoliths are often observed. Regionally, the Suite is extensive, 

voluminous and compositionally homogeneous, recording a Sn foliation and proto- to milonytic fabrics 

amongst most of exposed rocks. Roncato (2009) interpreted that, although the Carlos Chagas 

leucogranite matrix could be classified as a monzogranite, the best petrographic classification for this 

unit would be as a syenogranite, considering the high amount of large K-feldspar crystals within the 

rocks. Other minerals are garnet, biotite, sillimanite, apatite, monazite and ilmenite. According to Pinto 

et al. (2001), Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2006) and Castañeda et al. (2007), the Carlos Chagas leucogranites 

are, in general, tectonically juxtaposed with the paragneisses. 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

32 

It is suggested that the evolution of G2 Supersuite occurred between 585-560 Ma (Pedrosa-

Soares et al. 2007, 2011). Interestingly, there is a temporal overlap between the earliest G2 ages and the 

later G1 ages (630-580 Ma, Table 5). An older magmatic crystallization age of 591 ± 5 Ma obtained by 

Noce et al. (2000) for Ataléia granites indicate a larger period for the genesis of G2 Supersuite and 

corroborate the temporal overlap between the generation of G1 and G2 Supersuites. 

The G3 Supersuite 

The G3 Supersuite originated in a late to post-tectonic orogenic stage (Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; 

Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007). The G3 granites are usually garnet-cordierite 

leucogranites, garnet-leucogranites and cordierite-leucogranites that do not record the regional foliation. 

They are medium to coarse-grained, porphyritic to sub-porphyritic leucogranites containing garnet 

and/or cordierite large crystals (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). 

It is suggested by field relations and petrographic observations that G3 leucogranites are 

anatectic autochthonous to para-autochthonous products of deformed G2 granite partial melting, 

although the anatexis of NVC may also be an important source (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). In all cases, 

G3 genesis occurred posteriorly to the (syn-collisional) event that imprinted the regional foliation in the 

G2 and NVC rocks. According to Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2006), age differences between the 

crystallization of G2 and G3 Supersuites are ca. 35 million years. Table 7 summarizes the ages of the 

G3 Supersuite obtained from literature. 

The G4 Supersuite 

G4 Supersuite was generated between 535-500 Ma in a post-collisional orogenic stage related 

to gravitational (extensional) collapse of the Araçuaí Orogen (Table 9; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-

Leonardos 2000, Alkmim et al. 2006, Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2011). The G4 Supersuite consists 

mainly of S-type two-mica granites with locally well-preserved pegmatitic granite and biotite-granite 

bodies. These granitoids are foliation-free intrusive plutons, although some of them record a concordant 

regional foliation at their rims (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007). In majority, the G4 Supersuite is hosted by 

the Ribeirão da Folha and Salinas Formations, northwest from the study area.  

Although it is suggested that G4 Supersuite records the orogenic gravitational collapse (that 

generated G5 Supersuite), geochronological data also indicates a temporal overlap between the 

generation of the G3 and G4 Supersuites. Considering that there is a relation between contemporaneous 

rock-types, Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2007) interpreted that the G4 Supersuite consists of alochthonous 

bodies crystallized at higher crustal levels in comparison with autochthonous and para-autochthonous 

G3 bodies. Because the G4 Supersuite consists mainly of hydrated two-mica granite and whereas G3 is

The G5 Supersuite 

G5 Supersuite consists of I-type, post-collisional (ca. 520-490 Ma) plutonic magmatism related 

to the Araçuaí orogenic collapse (Table 10; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, Pedrosa-

Soares et al. 2001, 2006, Wiedemann et al. 2002, Alkmim et al. 2006). The G5 intrusions are Sn-free, 

ranging in composition from gabbro-norite to granite, with minor enderbite to charnockite facies. They 

are metaluminous to peraluminous, high-K calkaline, I-type granitoids that progressively evolve to more

36 

alkaline to peralkaline rocks (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011). Field relations suggest that all rock-types 

within the G5 Supersuite (e.g. biotite-granites and charnockite) have formed in the same magmatic 

event.

To the south of the Rio Doce river and in the Nova Venecia region, the intrusive G5 bodies are 

hosted mainly by high-grade paragneisses (including the NVC), as well as by G1 and G2 Supersuites. 

In these locations, deeper erosion levels tend to expose the internal structure of G5 plutons, e.g. the roots 

of diapirs with inverse zoning (Pedrosa-Soares et al 2011). To the north of latitude 19°, these mafic 

cores are absent due to higher erosion levels. In this segment, G5 bodies show a high-K and -Fe calk-

alkaline to alkaline, I- to A2-type post-collisional signature. These G5 intrusions are mainly hosted by 

G2 and high-grade paragneisses (i.e. NVC), where the metamorphic foliation of host-rocks are wrapped 

aroung G5 bodies. However, it has been suggested that metamorphism may have affected host rocks 

with contact aureoles, causing migmatization of mica-bearing rocks and forming cordierite-garnet 

leucogranitic neosomes (Pedrosa-Soares et al 2011). 

2.4 - KINEMATIC EVOLUTION OF THE ARAÇUAÍ OROGEN 

 The Brasiliano-Pan African amalgamation of West Gondwana generated a complex and large 

orogenic system limited by the São Francisco, Paranapanema and Rio de la Plata cratons to the west and 

the Congo and Kalahari cratons to the east. The Araçuaí West Congo Orogen formed as part of this 

orogenic system during the Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic times. This orogen was divided by the 

Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting into two complementary counterparts: the Araçuaí orogen in Brazil 

and the West Congo Belt in Africa (Fig. 4). Prior to this rifting, the São Francisco and Congo Cratons 

had remained connected since the Amazonian-Eburnian Cycle (2300-1900 Ma) by the so-called Bahia-

Gabão Bridge (Porada 1989). A model called “The nutcracker tectonics” (Alkmim et al. 2006, 2007) 

proposes five main stages for the evolution of the Orogen, each of which associated with the production 

and emplacement of the main granitoid Supersuites G1 to G5. The cartoon in Figure 8 illustrates these 

five stages, as well as the main contemporaneous events occurring in related Brasiliano-Pan African 

orogenic systems.  

 Stage 1 (Fig. 8) started with a continental rift phase, recorded in: anorogenic granites in Zadinian 

and Mayumbian groups in the West Congo Belt (ca. 1000-900 Ma; Silva et al. 2008); the anorogenic 

Salto da Divisa Suite (ca. 875 Ma; Silva et al. 2008) in northeast Brazil; syenites in the Southern Bahia 

Alkaline Province in northeast Brazil (ca. 732-696 Ma; Rosa et al. 2007); and in the Ribeirão da Folha 

ophiolite in southeast Brazil (ca. 660, Queiroga et al. 2007). According to Silva et al. (2008), these ages 

recorded in Africa and Brazil indicate a westward migration of the thermal axis of the rift. This rift 

created a narrow inland-sea basin to the south of latitude 18°S (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1998) where 

the units of the Macaúbas Group were deposited through an approximately 220 My period. Field 

evidence and U-Pb geochronology from both sides of the rift (e.g., Silva et al. 2008) as well as the 

presence of an ophiolitic sequence within the Macaúbas basin suggest that the maturation of the rift and 

full oceanic crust development occurred at ca. 660 Ma (Queiroga et al. 2007). 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

38 

Stage 2 (pre-collisional, 630-575 Ma) involved tectonic convergence of the two passive margins 

at ca. 630 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, Silva et al. 2005a), when the São-Francisco Peninsula started 

to rotate anti-clockwise, leading to compression of the Macaúbas basin, subduction of the oceanic crust 

underneath the Congo Continent and construction of a magmatic arc (Fig. 8). During convergence, the 

G1 granitoid Supersuite is believed to have been generated as part of the magmatic arc at ca. 630-585 

Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006, 2011). Contemporaneously to stage 2, some of the events occurring in 

the Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic system are: syn-orogenic formation of the Brasília Belt (ca. 650-

630 Ma; Valeriano and Pimentel 2008); final collision between the São Francisco and Paranapanema 

Cratons (ca. 630 Ma; Trouw et al. 2000, Campos Neto and Caby 2000); arc-magmatism in the Kaoko 

Coastal Terrane (655-625 Ma; Goscombe et al. 2005); arc-magmatism in the RFB (Rio Negro arc; ca. 

635-620 Ma; Heilbron and Machado 2003); and pre- to syn-orogenic magmatism in the DFB (ca. 640-

590 Ma), with collisional climax at 640-620 Ma (Basei et al. 2005, Silva et al. 2005b).  

Stage 3 (Syn-collisional) began with the collision and development of a double-verging external 

fold-thrust belt towards the São Francisco Craton to the east and the Congo Craton to the west (Pedrosa-

Soares et al. 2001, 2007; Fig. 8). During this stage, the G2 Supersuite is believed to have been formed 

at ca. 585-560 Ma (Nalini et al. 2000, Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, Pedrosa-Soares 

et al. 2001, 2006, Silva et al. 2005a, Martins et al. 2004). This is contemporaneous with the collisional 

tectono-metamorphic event affecting most of the Ribeira Belt (590-550 Ma; Heilbron and Machado 

2003); with peak of metamorphism in the Kaoko Belt (ca. 580-570 Ma); and partly with the 

transpressional orogenesis and reworking of the Kaoko Belt (ca. 570-550 Ma, Goscombe et al. 2005). 

Several studies (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares 2001, 2006, 2008, Gradim et al. 2014) link the G2 granitoids to 

anatexis of the paragneisses in the NVC. The migmatitic paragneisses (i.e. NVC) contain a Sn foliation 

that is only observed in specific G2 granititic plutons (widespread or locally within plutons or in small 

bodies intruding the NVC), which are interpreted to be coeval with the ductile deformation generated 

by the collisional phase in both rock-types (Roncato 2009).  

 Stages 4 and 5 record the lateral scape of the southern part of the belt due to space problems as 

the convergence between the landmasses continued, promoting the tectonic collapse of the central part 

of the orogen (Alkmim et al. 2006; Fig. 8). The G3 Supersuite is inferred to have formed during a late- 

to post-collisional stage whereas the G4 and G5 are interpreted to have formed during a post-collisional 

stage and orogenic collapse (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, 2006, 2008). The records of stage 4 (560-535 

Ma) in the AO are contemporaneous to: the development of major dextral trascurrent faults and 

associated metamorphism in the RFB (Heilbron and Machado 2003); the end of transpressional 

reworking of the Kaoko Belt (ca. 570-550 Ma; Goscombe et al. 2005); the final closure of southern 

Adamastor ocean (Frimmel and Frank 1998).; the initiation of closure of the Khomas Ocean, recorded 

in mafic magmatism (560-550 Ma; Gray et al. 2008); the continent-continent collision in the Gariep

Belt (547-543 Ma; Frimmel and Frank 1998).; the collision of the Amazon Craton forming the Araguaia 

and Paraguai Belts (540-520 Ma; Valeriano and Pimentel 2008). Likewise, contemporaneous to Stage 

5 (520-480 Ma) are: the Buzios Orogeny, formed from the collision between the Cabo Frio terrane and 

the RFB (530-510 Ma; Schmitt et al. 2004); end of transpression followed by shortening phase, with 

post-kinematic magmatism and post-metamorphic cooling in the Kaoko Belt (530-505 Ma; Goscombe 

et al. 2005); accretion of the Cuchilla Dionisio terrane to the south of the DFB (530 Ma; Bossi and 

Gaucher 2003); the Damara Belt peak deformation/metamorphism (530-510 Ma; Jung and Mezger 

2003). The final events occurring within stage 5 period are: shear zone reactivation in the Gariep Belt 

(506-495 Ma; Frimmel and Frank 1998). and Kaoko Belt (490-467 Ma, Gray et al. 2006); and the 

tectonic collapse of the Ribeira Belt (513-480 Ma, Heilbron and Machado 2003). These late events are 

encompassed by the period in which most of G5 granitoids were generated.

CHAPTER 3  

GEOCHRONOLOGY 

3.1 - Introduction 

Zircon and monazite are common accessory phases in high-grade rocks that may record a 

number of metamorphic and magmatic events and processes in orogenic terranes, as well as ages of 

deposition in sedimentary basins. Both of them strongly fractionate Uranium (U) from Lead (Pb), 

although monazite is much less resistant in relation to zircon to complete reseting during subsequent 

metamorphic events (Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997). This and other differences should be taken into 

consideration when analyzing both and the data obtained should be carefully interpreted with respect to 

their mineral characteristics and behavior. The link between assemblages and common accessory 

minerals in migmatites and granulites, such as zircon and monazite, have the potential to constrain the 

P-T evolution of the rocks through time. Accessory mineral growth can be linked to a particular part of 

the P-T path, specific metamorphic reactions particular coexisting minerals, allowing for rates of 

orogenic processes and times of events to be constrained (e.g. Korhonen et al. 2013, Rubatto 2002,  

Hermann &amp;amp; Rubatto 2003; Rubatto et al. 2006; Baldwin &amp;amp; Brown 2008).and  

The correct interpretation of accessory mineral ages is critical in this correlation, otherwise 

allowing for a complete mislead in the construction of geodynamic models. Specific problems may arise, 

for instance, from the simplistic interpretation of zircon and monazite ages as dating the peak of 

metamorphism. Recent advances have shown that many zircon and monazite ages record events along 

the retrograde P-T path (e.g., Brown &amp;amp; Korhonen 2009; Korhonen et al. 2013; Baldwin &amp;amp; Brown 2008). 

Such advances include the use of trace element partitioning between zircon and ferromagnesian phases 

and the accessory phase trace element thermometry (Brown &amp;amp; Korhonen 2009, Rubatto 2002). One 

important advance in quantitative constrains to this matter is the thermodynamic modeling of accessory 

phases by the integration of experimental data on zircon and monazite growth and dissolution to 

quantitative phase diagrams (Kelsey et al. 2008; Kelsey &amp;amp; Powell 2011). Such pioneer studies bring 

light to our current limited knowledge of the dissolution and growth of zircon and monazite in 

suprasolidus crust in relation to the P-T evolution and the changing bulk chemistry during melting 

(Yakumchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014). What we know is that both physics and chemistry control the complex 

behavior of zircon and monazite under suprasolidus conditions through factors that include: the 

microstructural location of the accessory minerals; the kinectics of dissolution; the extent of antexis; the 

chemistry of the melt; the P-T path; and the rate of extraction (Yakumchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014, and 

references therein). Using a thermodynamic modelling approach, Yakumchuck &amp;amp; Brown (2014) 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region

evaluated the consequences of melt loss on the dissolution and growth of zircon and monazite in residual 

source rocks. In migmatite melanosomes and residual granulites (metagreywackes and metapelites), 

those authors suggests that: (1) During heating to peak temperature and subsequent isothermal 

decompression recorded, some zircon is expected to survive whereas monazite may be completely 

consumed; (2) During cooling to the solidus, after decompression, limited growth of new zircon and 

monazite is expected to occur from melt trapped along grain boundaries; and by contrast that (4) 

leucosomes and anatectic granites will contain mostly newly formed zircon and monazite with minimal 

inherited components; and (5) observed preservation of cores inside newly formed zircon in many 

anatectic granites demonstrates that segregation, ascent and emplacement is commonly fast enough to 

limit dissolution of these inherited grains. Because of these complexities in zircon systematics, in the 

ideal case it would be better to use only the concordant zircons. However, this may lead to an oversight 

of important thermal episodes (Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997), especially in multiply intruded terranes 

recording metamorphic overprints. In this context, complications in interpreting age data arise 

(Korhonen et al. 2013, Yakumchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014): do ranges of (Concordia) ages in depleted source 

rocks record the duration of a process such as crustal melting or simply register the crystallization of 

trapped melt during exhumation and cooling? Based on systematic dating of several samples combined 

with phase equilibria modelling, Korhonen et al. (2013) suggest that variability in wheighted mean ages 

between samples results mainly from differences in the temperature of the solidi according to the degree 

of melt depletion. Thus concordant U-Pb ages from matrix zircons likely record the time taken for melt 

trapped on grain boundaries to crystallize during cooling to the solidus (Yakumchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014). 

Zircon is the most common accessory mineral used in geochronology. The main reasons for that 

are: (1) its widespread occurrence; (2) the high precision ages obtained and; (3) the resistance of this 

mineral to thermal disturbance  (Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997). Uranium and Pb are strongly fractionated 

during the growth of zircon because of differences in the two ion charges (U4+ vs. Pb2+) and in their ionic 

radii (U4+ =1.00 A °; Pb2+=1.29 A °, in VIII coordination; Shannon, 1976). The fact that U4+ substitute 

readily for Zr4+ (ionic radii= 0.84 A°) explains the high U-content and high U/Pb ratios in zircon in 

comparison to other silicates and that is the reason why zircon is suited for high precision 

geochronology. The decay of two U-isotopes to two Pb-isotopes allows the determination of three ages 

(238U/206Pb, 235U/207Pb, 207Pb/206Pb) by analyzing Pb isotopes and U and Pb concentrations from any 

zircon. In the concordia diagram proposed by Wetherill (1956) all three ages can be plotted, which 

facilitates interpretation of discordant data.  

This chapter aims to describe some of the characteristics of zircon and some of the complexities 

involved in the usage of zircon geochronology. First, the main morphologies (Figure 10) and textural 

characterization of igneous and metamorphic zircon are presented in order to relate metamorphic 

petrogenesis and zircon growth. Then, it is presented brief description of the radioactive decay law and

the use of lead isotopes in geochronology. What follows is a summary of how to evaluate and filter U-

Pb ages, including common ways to interpret discordance in magmatic and metamorphic zircons. 

3.2 - Zircon in igneous rocks 

Zircon is more common in igneous rocks of intermediate to Si-saturated composition and least 

common in less saturated rocks. Zircon formation depends on the relationship between zircon saturation, 

crystallization and melt composition. The zircon saturation temperatures will determine whether zircon 

was an early or late crystallizing phase. In zircon-undersatured melts, zircon xenocrysts will dissolve. 

Zircon crystals in some rock-types preserve information from melt compositions prior and after 

dissolution. For instance, in intermediate S-type granites, it is common to observe dissolution textures 

preserved within zircon crystals, which record period of undersaturation to periods of zircon saturation 

in the melt (Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger 2003). Figure 10 shows the variation in growth zoning in magmatic 

zircons. 

 Textural characterization of igneous zircon 

External morphology of igneous zircon 

Often zircon crystals are faceted with combination of prism ({100} and {110}) and pyramid 

forms ({211}, {101} and {301}), although morphologies are highly variable. In general, zircon form 

development and grain size are dependent upon the time of zircon-saturation in the crystallization history 

of a rock (Fig.1). Examples for that are (Corfu et al. 2003): (1) Small, often acicular crystals tend to 

form due to local saturation at the edge of an early crystallizing phase; (2) Euhedral, large crystals with 

width-to-length ratios of about 1:2-1:4 tend to form in early zircon-saturated melts; (3) Late crystallizing 

anhedral crystals tend to grow in the interstices between earlier-formed crystals in plutonic rocks; (4) 

Rapidly crystallized prismatic to acicular crystals with large width-to-length ratios (up to about 1:12) 

tend to form in volcanic rocks; and (5) Zircons that contain large melt-trail inclusions tend to form in 

volcanic rocks and sometimes in plutonic rocks. However, it is important to note that: (1) A variety of 

morphologies may be observed within a single rock; (2) Similar to identical morphologies may be 

observed in different rock-types; and (3) During a single growth event, the external morphology of a 

single crystal can change a number of times.

Internal morphology of igneous zircon 

The application of CL and BSE imaging allows the identification and description of a large 

number of internal textures in many minerals, including zircon. The predominant zircon texture is the 

oscillatory zoning (also called growth zoning, Corfu et al. 2003). The origin of this zoning probably 

involves a kinetic mechanism operating at the crystal/melt interface (Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger 2003). 

Mattinson et al. (1996) suggest that episodic growth zoning is a result of the interplay between the stage 

of zircon growth, the nature of the crystal-liquid interface, the degree of melt supersaturation, the 

diffusion rates and the oxidation state.  

The growth zoning reflects compositional variations of Zr and Si and of Hf, P, Y, the REE, U 

and Th (Corfu et al. 2003, Hoskin 2000). The zones composition tend to vary between two end-

members, one of which is very low in trace elements (i.e. approaching pure zircon) and the other is 

highly enriched in trace elements (up to several wt% of the impurity element). The mode of development 

and thickness of the bands is largely variable, as shown in the following cases (Corfu et al. 2003): 

(1) Almost bimodal sucession of trace-element rich and trace-element poor bands with almost no 

intermediate composition (Fig. 11(1-2));  

(2) The zones span a wide compositional range (Fig. 11(3-12)); 

(3) The compositional difference becomes so small that yields only faintly visible patterns (fig 11(13-

15)); 

(4) There is no visible zoning (Fig. 11(16)); 

Regular oscillatory zoning can be interrupted by textural discontinuities along which the original 

zoning is resorbed and succeded by the deposition of new-growth-zoned zircon (figs. 11(1), 10(1) and 

10(2)). This may reflect intermediate periods of Zr undersaturation in the magma, owing to large-scale 

mixing phenomena, or to local kinetic phenomena (e.g. Fig. 11(15)). Sector zoning is a special case of 

zoning. Examples of sector zoning are shown in Figures 10(3) and 10(4). In the first, the pyramidal 

sectors are enriched in U (and other trace-elements) in opposition to low-U contents in the prismatic 

sectors and in the latter the sectors are defined by variations between the two prismatic faces.  

3.3 - Xenocrystic zircon cores 

Xenocrystic zircon cores are commonly observed in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. 

Figure 11 shows the variable appearance of xenocrystic cores in magmatic and high-grade metamorphic 

rocks. What follows is a brief description of them based on Corfu et al. (2003).  



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

46 

Xenocrysts occur as cores mantled by newly grown zircon, as unmantled subrounded crystals 

or, rarely, as euhedral crystals. The recognition of xenocrystic cores takes in consideration many factors, 

such as differences in U-content between a core and a rim. In this case, differential metamictization 

expands the high-U part and transforms the original colorless domains into pink to brown (or even 

opaque) zircon. If the core is richer in U than the rim, core expansion will eventually fracture the more 

rigid rim (figs. 10(1-4; 19-21)). Conversely, if the rim is richer in U than the core, generally, the rim 

become much darker than the core and there will be no fracturing (Figs. 10(1,3)). However, there might 

be some exceptions (figs. 12(1-2)). 

When both the core and rim are low in U, the use of CL and BSE is usually successful in the 

determination of the xenocryst. In order to distinguish rims from xenocrystic cores, one need to observe 

the geometries and local discontinuities characterized by: geometrically iregular surfaces which truncate 

internal zoning (figs. 10(5-8,11,18)); and geometrically irregular surfaces that separate subrounded, 

unzoned, or chaotically zoned cores from growth zoned rims (Fig. 10(2-3, 9, 12, 16,19-20)). 

These features can indicate part of the zircon history. For instance, some discontinuities can 

indicate resorption of the early zircon phase (Figs. 10(7, 11, 13) or reveal that new zircon growth has 

occurred in a different crystallographic orientation than the substrate zircon (Fig. 10(11)). However, 

sometimes it may be difficult to make a distinction or locate the actual boundary between cores and rims 

(figs. 10(4, 12, 16, 17)), which may signify that the zircon record a more complex geological history.  

Evaluating the origin of xenocrystic cores may not be a clear and straightforward task. The 

reason is that xenocrystic cores themselves do not yield many clues as to their origin. Occasionally, they 

preserve the abrasions and fracturing caused by erosion and sedimentation processes (figs. 10(14-15)), 

but usually such clues are not present. One way to interpret the origin of these cores is using evidence 

from field observations. For instance, xenocrystic cores from zircons that grew in migmatites within a 

clastic sedimentary sequence or in a classical S-type granitic body can readily be interpreted as being of 

detrital origin and thus xenocrystic populations can be linked to potential sedimentary sources. On the 

other hand, in granitic bodies of less obvious crustal origin or in a mixed gneissic terrane, the xenocrysts 

could represent both supracrustal and magmatic origin. In this case, it may be not possible to 

unambiguously verify a detrital origin. 

3.4 - Zircon in metamorphic rocks 

Unlike melt-precipitated igneous zircons, the term “metamorphic zircon” is ambiguous as it 

refers to zircons formed under metamorphic conditions by a large set of different processes. According 

to Hoskin &amp;amp; Black (2000, and references therein), these processes include: (1) precipitation from melt 

during anatectic melting; (2) sub-solidus nucleation and crystallization (blastogenesis) by diffusion of 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

47 

Zr and Si released by metamorphic breakdown reactions of major silicates and accessory phases; (3) 

precipitation from aqueous metamorphic fluids; and (4) recrystallization of protolith zircon. As the 

precipitation from a fluid (aqueous or melt) may occur under non-metamorphic conditions as well as at 

metamorphic pressures and temperatures, “metamorphic zircons” are not formed by processes (1) and 

(3) in a strict sense. Processes (2) and (4) form zircons that display no internal structures, except for 

possible weak sector zonation. Metamorphic zircon crystals that display internal texture features are 

expected to form if zircon formation via mechanism (4) is not complete. They may display areas with 

preserved oscillatory zoning and unzoned areas where zoning have been destroyed.  Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 

(1997) make a distinction between metamorphic zircons (i.e. that grew as a result of a metamorphic 

reaction) and metamorphosed zircons (i.e that were formed during an earlier event and recrystallized 

during a thermal overprint) in a regional metamorphic context or as a result of entrainment in a magma. 

Hoskin &amp;amp; Black (2000) and Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad (1997) suggest different nomenclatures for 

zircons formed during metamorphic events, which may lead to a confusion in the use of terms. However, 

in essence they define zircons from metamorphic rocks similarly. Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad (1997) interpret 

that metamorphic zircons formed via mechanisms (1) and (3) behave like igneous zircons and that the 

ones formed via mechanisms (2) and (4) are metamorphosed zircons. Hoskin &amp;amp; Black (2000) consider 

that zircons formed via mechanisms (1) and (3) would not be “metamorphic”, whereas the ones formed 

via mechanisms (2) and (4) would be the true metamorphic zircon.    

  Textural characterization of metamorphic zircon 

Accompanying the variety of P-T-x conditions that are collectively termed as metamorphic, 

there is a multiplicity of metamorphic zircon textures.  

 External morphology of metamorphic zircon 

Metamorphically grown, or metamorphically modified zircon crystals are generally 

characterized by subrounded and highly resorbed (=grown from a fluid phase) shapes (figs. 11(25-

27,31,34)), but euhedral shapes are also possible, especially in fluid-rich systems such as amphibolite 

facies mica schists or migmatites (Corfu et al. 2003).  

Zircons in low-grade metamorphic rocks display resorption or metamorphic growth over zircon 

usually inherited from the protolith. High-grade metamorphic rocks (e.g. granulites) may contain zircon 

that grew in the presence or absence of anatectic melt (Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger 2003). In migmatites, if 

the development of crystal faces was due to growth in contact with a melt phase, the zircons are not 

strictly metamorphic, but are magmatic (Corfu et al. 2003). Morphologies in high-grade rocks are 

usually rounded and ovoid shapes interpreted to have formed by resorption by a zircon-undersaturated 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

48 

intergranular fluid. These zircons are often accompanied by “soccer-ball” shaped zircon (Hoskin &amp;amp; 

Schaltegger 2003, soccer-ball zircon in Fig. 11(32). 

According to Corfu et al. (2003), the subrounded metamorphic zircons may display various 

degrees of modification. Moderate rounding as well as smoothly subrounded grains (destroyed original 

crystal shape) are both observed in zircons from gneiss samples. The second feature is more common in 

granulite facies metamorphic rocks, where zircons often display multifaceted exteriors (fig 11(32-33)) 

that may consist either of largely reworked original zircon or of entirely new-grown metamorphic zircon. 

In metamorphosed mafic rocks, it is locally observed that zircons may have irregular shapes (Fig.11(25-

27)) that in some cases may represent metamorphically grown polycrystalline zircon. In other instances, 

they may reflect resorption of originally irregular and fragmented zircons in mafic rocks (Fig. 11(24)) 

or in composite crystals found in granites (Fig.11(22)). Special cases are those observed in impact-

related fracturing and rapid new growth of polycrystalline zircon immediately after the impact (Fig. 

11(35-36)).  

 Internal morphology of metamorphic zircon 

According to Corfu et al. (2003), zircons from metamorphic rocks display internal textures that 

may represent growth zones, preserved igneous cores, recrystallized domains or other domains with 

different structural (re)organization. Those textures are observed with the use of CL and BSE imaging. 

In high-grade rocks, there is often a distinct sequence of internal structures from an initial low-

luminescence growth zone (that can be over growing an inherited core) to a sequentially overgrow by 

sector domains. These textural domains are often followed by oscillatory-zoned domains (Hoskin &amp;amp; 

Schaltegger, 2003).  

The formation of metamorphic zircon by the reworking of existing zircon may occur via 

recrystallization and local dissolution-reprecipitation. Such processes produce a variety or textures, 

which are commonly the secondary textures: blurred primary zoning; convoluted zoning; and 

transgressive recrystallization (Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger, 2003).

3.5 - Zircon and metamorphic petrogenesis 

Zircon-forming events may occur prior to, at, or after peak metamorphic (P-T) conditions. To 

determine the geological significance of an isotopic age from a metamorphic zircon it is necessary to 

define when in the petrogenesis of the rock this zircon (or a specific growth zone) formed. Thus, it has 

to be determined whether zircons formed in the solid-state, by precipitation from a fluid (melt, aqueous 

or carbonic), or by recrystallization of protolith zircon. Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger (2003) summarized many 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

51 

aspects of metamorphic petrogenesis and zircon behavior. This section is mainly based in the study from 

Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger (2003), which, combined with other further mentioned studies, summarizes much 

of the systematic of zircon generation during metamorphic petrogenesis.   

  The growth of new zircon during metamorphism 

New zircon can grow during prograde, peak and retrograde metamorphism, which occur within 

a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. At P-T conditions lower than upper-amphibolite 

and granulite-grade, the growth of new “metamorphic” zircon is rare and may be attribute to 

recrystallization of protolith zircon. At P-T granulite-grade conditions, the growth of new zircon occurs 

at sub-solidus conditions and also during anatexis. In general, the volume of newly formed zircon is 

dependent upon temperatures and the volume and composition of melt. However, there are examples 

where the volume of zircon generated exceeds-by-far the volume expected from saturation limits.  

The formation of new zircon in granulite-grade rocks by net-transfer reactions is dependent upon 

the solubility of Zr in product phases. For instance: 

(1) Both garnet and hornblende contain tens of ppm of Zr, enough to produce new zircon by Zr release 

in these minerals partake in breakdown reaction such as garnet + sillimanite + quartz -&gt; cordierite 

+ zircon (Fraser et al. 1997); 

(2) During anatexis, biotite may be a source of Zr for zircon growth (in the Ivrea Zone, Vavra et al. 

1996); 

(3) Zircon, titanite and rutile may form from breakdown of zirconolite and zircon from breakdown of 

allanite in upper-amphibolite grade gneisses (Pan 1997); 

(4) Ilmenite may be the source for Zr to form metamorphic zircon (Bingen et al. 2001); 

(5) Zr has a higher solubility in osumilite and orthopyroxene at higher grades than in cordierite at lower 

grades. In high-grade rocks from Rogaland (Norway), zircon was formed by the reaction garnet + 

sillimanite +quartz -&gt; cordierite + zircon but did not form during the reaction garnet + sillimanite + 

quartz + biotite -&gt; osumilite +orthopyroxene + spinel + magnetite (Degeling et. al 2001).  

The REE display specific patterns in metamorphic zircon. Rubatto (2002), Rubatto et al. (2001) 

and Rubatto and Hermann (2001) studied those compositions and which patterns are displayed in 

igneous, metamorphic and metamorphic-melt zircons. The REE compositions of new net-

transfer/metamorphic zircon can be linked to specific stages of metamorphic petrogenesis, which means 

that the U-Pb isotopic ages of those domains can allow the assessment of the rate of tectonic and 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

52 

metamorphic processes. For instance, when trace-element partitioning between co-existing zircon and 

garnet occurs, Ce has by far the highest preference for zircon thus producing extremely large positive 

Ce anomalies. In high-grade rocks, zircons formed by net-transfer reactions have additionally REE 

patterns characterized by depleted HREE abundances (due to partitioning competition with garnet) and 

very small negative Eu anomalies (that may be inherited from whole-rock compositions as well as 

indicate formation in the absence of plagioclase). However, these patterns from zircon produced by 

subsolidus-growth with garnet greatly differ from metamorphic zircon grown in equilibrium with an 

anatectic melt (which behaves likewise igneous zircon). The latter are enriched in trace-elements with 

ionic radii close to that of Zr (i.e. Hf, Y, U, P) and have steep REE patterns increasing from La to Lu 

with positive Ce and negative Eu anomalies. Apparently, one systematic distinction between igneous 

and metamorphic zircon may be the high Th/U ratio for the first and low Th/U ratio for the latter, 

although this does not apply for all the cases. 

  Solid-state recrystallization and dissolution-reprecipitation of protolith zircon 

Solid-state recrystallization and local dissolution-precipitation are the processes responsible for 

the formation of metamorphic zircon by “reworking” of protolith igneous or detrital zircon or previously 

formed metamorphic zircon. At low-grade metamorphism, these processes appear to be insignificant 

because only non-metamictic protoliths tend to survive, although they can be mechanically fractured. 

At high-grade metamorphic conditions, these processes tend to create a variety of internal (secondary) 

textures, described by Vavra et al. (1996, 1999), Schaltegger et al. (1999), Hoskin &amp;amp; Black (2002) and 

Rubatto (2002). Based on these authors, the textures include the following: 

(1) Blurred (faded) primary zoning: the first indication of metamorphic disturbance of the structure; 

(2) Convoluted zoning: texture considered to result from further convolution of blurred primary zoning. 

External parts of metamorphic zircon may show non-planar zoning formed by a series of low-CL 

and high-CL sinuous zones (“flow zones”) that may appear to be folded. Each of the zones can 

become discontinuous and truncated;  

(3) Transgressive recrystallization: the secondary texture produced by local recrystallization of zircon 

both under non-metamorphic conditions and in high-grade metamorphic rocks. This texture is 

reported to be internally featureless, have sinuous and lobate edges, and to cut across other primary 

and secondary textures. Although in general these areas may be featureless, they may preserve relics 

(“ghosts”) of primary textures including oscillatory zoning. A grey-CL border can determine the 

recrystallization front that separates recrystallization areas from other structures. Most commonly, 

the recrystallization front appears to migrate from crystal pyramidal-terminations towards the 

interior of grains, although recrystallization may occur at locations away from crystal terminations, 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

53 

at domain boundaries or around inclusions. 

The end result of transgressive recrystallization is complete recrystallization. The preservation 

of primary textures (ghost textures), the “mixed” isotopic ages (Fig. 13) and their measured trace-

element compositions is evidence for solid-state, isochemical (in a crystal-scale) recrystallization. The 

occurrence of solid-state recrystallization has been proposed to occur either by the presence of a fluid-

phase, absence of a fluid-phase or in both cases.  

Recrystallization of protolith has the effect of purging cations that are not the essential structural 

constituent cations (ESCs, which are Zr, Hf, Si) because of the significant difference between their ionic 

radii. Figure 14 shows isotopic and trace-element characteristics of partially to fully recrystallized zircon 

from a meta-granitoid gneiss in a study by Hoskin and Black (2000). Some of the observation is this 

study are: (1) eightfold coordinated Th4+ is believed to be preferentially purged because it has a larger 

ionic radius than U4+ in recrystallized zircon, which appears to be the cause for the decrease in the Th/U 

ratio that correlates with a decrease in the 207Pb/206Pb age of the zircon; (2) the completely recrystallized 

zircon have the younger cluster of ages with Th/U &amp;lt;0.1; and (3) within a single crystal, trace elements 

are partitioned between recrystallized areas and the recrystallization front, enriching the front and 

depleting the recrystallized areas, except for Hf. Hafnium enrichment is characteristic of recrystallized 

zircons. This differential trace-element purging as a function of cation ionic radii may be the explanation 

for U-Pb resetting during recrystallization with preservation of Lu-Hf isotopic system. In a single crystal, 

recrystallized patterns for co-existing recrystallized zircon and recrystallization fronts reveal that the 

first tend to be relatively depleted in the LREE and MREE with no measurable difference for Tm, Yb 

or Lu (Fig. 14). This observation results from the fact that the LREE have a greater difference in cation 

size in relation to Zr, whereas the HREE have the smallest difference, likewise Th and U.

3.6 - The law of radioactive decay 

The law of radioactive decay is well known and described in many studies. Hereafter, the law 

will be briefly described based on Dickin (2005).

The rate of decay of a radioactive parent nuclide to a stable daughter product is proportional to 

the number of atoms, n, present at any time t: 

 

  [1]  

On rearranging equation [1] we obtain: 

  [2] 

Integrating expression [2] from t = 0 to t, given that the number of atoms present at time t = 0 is 

n0, we obtain: 

[3] 

Hence 

[4] 

Which can also be written as 

[5] 

A useful way of referring to the rate of decay of a radionuclide is the ‘half-life’, t½ , which is the 

time required for half of the parent atoms to decay. In [5], on substituting n = n/2 and t = t1/2 , and taking 

the natural logarithm of both sites, we obtain: 

[6] 

The number of radiogenic daughter formed, D*, is equal to the number of parent atoms 

consumed: 

[7] 

Where: 

?=constant of proportionality called decay constant, which is 

characteristic of the radionuclide in question and is expressed in 

units of reciprocal time. The decay constant ? states the probability 

that a given atom of the radionuclide will decay within a stated time. 

dn/dt = rate of change of the number of parent atoms. It is negative 

because the rate decreases with time.

If the number of daughter atoms at time t = 0 is D0, then the total number of daughter atoms 

after time t is given as 

[10] 

This equation is the fundamental basis of most geochronological dating tools. 

- The uranium-series decay chains 

In these chains, the daughter products of radioactive decay (other than three Pb isotopes) are 

themselves radioactive. Hence the rate of decay of such a daughter product is given by the difference 

between its rate of production from the parent and its own decay rate: 

[11] 

On substituting [5] for n1 in [11], we obtain 

[12] 

This equation is integrated for a chosen set of initial conditions, the simplest of which sets n2 = 

0 at t = 0.

 Lead isotopes 

A summary of the main equations related to lead isotopes is hereafter given based on Dickin 

(2005). Lead (Pb) has four stables isotopes: 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb and 204Pb. Among them, only 204Pb is non-

radiogenic, whereas the others are the final decay products of three complex decay chains from uranium 

(U) and thorium (Th). In the time-scale of millions of years, the intermediate members of those chains 

can be ignored, as they are relatively short-lived. Table 11 shows the ultimate parent-daughter pairs, of 

which the parent of highest atomic weight decays to the daughter of lowest atomic weight. From the 

Table, is can be noted that the half-life of 235U is comparable to the age of the universe and the half-life 

of 238U is comparable to the age of the Earth, whereas that for 235U is much shorter, so that almost all 

primordial 235U in the Earth has now decayed to 207Pb.

It is possible to write an equation derived from the general equation [10] for each of the nuclides 

involved in the above-mentioned decay schemes, considering a system of age t (e.g. a granite intrusion 

that crystallized from a magma): 

[14] 

[15] 

[16] 

Because 204Pb is non-radiogenic, we can conveniently divide the members of the equations 

throughout by 204Pb, obtaining equations that contain isotope ratios rather than absolute nuclide 

abundances. For the two uranium decay schemes, we obtain: 

[17] 

[18] 

There are minerals that strongly incorporates uranium at the time of formation but does not 

incorporate lead, such as zircon. In this case, equation [14] could be simplified by removal of the initial 

206Pb to yield

Where Pb* represents radiogenic lead only or that the initial lead has been subtracted. Taking 

238U to the other side of the equation yields 

[20] 

A similar equation is obtained by deriving from [15]: 

[21] 

If U-rich minerals such as zircon have remained in a closed system for U and Pb, they give 

concordant values of t when their isotopic compositions are inserted into the left-hand sides of equations 

[20] and [21]. Plotting those compositions graphically, they define a curve that was termed the 

Concordia by Wetherill (1956). The Concordia curve can be drawn by substituting decay constants and 

successive values of t into the right-hand sides of [20] and [21] and plotting the results for each value of 

t. 

3.7 - Using ages: how to evaluate and filter U-Pb ages 

Geherels (2011) describes the graphical representation of ages in a Concordia diagram and 

evaluates methods on how to use ages and how to filter ages obtained from U-Pb zircon analysis 

(especially from detrital zircons).  

The graphical representation of U-Pb ages on a Pb*/U concordia diagram is possible because: 

(1) There are two decay systems (238U?206Pb and 235U?207Pb); 

(2) Half lives for the two systems are appropriate for use through all Earth time, except for the most 

recent one; 

(3) The two decay systems are linked because 238U/235U is constant (=137.88, Steiger and Jäger, 1977) 

in nearly all crustal rocks; 

(4) As 204Pb is non-radiogenic, it can be used to account for Pb present in the crystal at the time of 

formation. 

The Pb*/U Concordia diagram plots 206Pb*/238U versus 207Pb*/238U as a function of age. The

59 

Concordia diagram also shows 206Pb*/207Pb*, which is the slope of a line from the origin through the 

analysis (206Pb* / 207Pb* = 206Pb* / 238U/ [207Pb* / 235U x 137.88]. 

The 206Pb*/238U and 206Pb*/207Pb* are two independent measurements whereas 207Pb*/235U is 

calculated from these ratios and the modern 238U/235U. The 206Pb*/238U ratio is determined by comparison 

with a tracer solution containing known amounts of Pb and U for ID-TIMS, or by comparison with 

standards for SIMS and LA-ICP-MS. The 206Pb*/207Pb* ratio generally requires only a minor correction 

because there is little instrumental fractionation of 206Pb relative to 207Pb. The 207Pb*/235U is calculated 

instead of measured because 235U is much (137.88 times) smaller than 238U and its measurement would 

add significant uncertainty to the 207Pb*/235U age. An analysis is plotted on a Concordia diagram based 

on 206Pb*/207Pb* (expressed as 207Pb*/206Pb* in many labs) and 206Pb*/238U. The three 206Pb*/238U, 

206Pb*/207Pb* and 207Pb*/235U ages are the intersection of 206Pb*/238U,  206Pb*/207Pb* and 207Pb*/235U lines 

with Concordia (Fig. 15).  

The 206Pb*/238U, 207Pb*/235U and 206Pb*/207Pb* have uncertainties that form, coincidently, a 

zircon-shaped polygon in the diagram (Fig. 16). There is a variation in the relative values of the three 

uncertainties as a function of age. In theory and in practice, all three uncertainties have the same value 

at about 1.4 Ga. The age resolution of the U-Pb system is poorest at ~1.4 Ga because of the variations 

in the relative values of the three uncertainties as a function of age. For younger samples than 1.4 Ga, 

206Pb*/238U ages are the most precise and the 206Pb*/207Pb* the least precise, whereas for older samples 

the values are reversed, with 206Pb*/207Pb* more precise than 206Pb*/238U. The uncertainty of 207Pb*/235U 

is always intermediate in value.  

When all three ages are similar within error, an analysis plots on the Concordia line and is 

described as being concordant. If it does not, it is discordant, which means that ages increase from 

206Pb*/238U to 207Pb*/235U to 206Pb*/207Pb*. For detrital zircons, discordance most commonly occurs due 

to loss of Pb during younger thermal/hydrothermal events or due to inheritance of older material. In the 

first case, the analysis moves down the 206Pb*/207Pb* line that existed at the time of disturbance and in 

the second case it moves up along a mixing line. Reverse discordance (plots above the Concordia) occurs 

most commonly due to inaccuracy in the measurement of 206Pb*/238U. The discordance = 100 – 100 × 

[206Pb*/238U age / 206Pb*/207Pb* age], where a perfectly concordant analysis have 0% of discordance. 

The concordance = 100 × [206Pb*/238U age / 206Pb*/207Pb* age], where a perfectly concordant analysis is 

equal to 100%.

2012). The Concordia line shows coincidence of the three chronometers as a function of age (Wetherill 1956). 

Note that 206Pb/238U and 206Pb/207Pb are the two independent measurements; 207Pb/235U is calculated from these 

ratios and the modern 238U/235U (137.88).

and Archean ages (from Geherels 2011). The relative magnitudes (in millions of years) of the three primary 

uncertainties are also indicated. Inset on right is a graphical depiction of the three primary uncertainties. 

With increasing age, zircons are more susceptible to Pb-loss (due to increasing lattive damaging 

during radioactive decay, see next section). Thus, it is more common to Precambrian zircons to be by a 

few percent to a few tens of percent. For instance, Figure 17 shows a Concordia diagram for a zircon 

that crystallized at ~1500 Ma and experienced Pb-loss at ~500 Ma. All three ages (207Pb*/235U, 

206Pb*/207Pb*and 206Pb*/238U) are younger than the crystallization age, with the 206Pb*/207Pb* age the 

closest to the true age. Thus, for reasonable degrees of discordance (~10-30%) the 206Pb*/207Pb* age is 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

61 

generally more accurate, even though the 206Pb*/238U age is more precise. A common cutoff is 0.8-1.0 

Ga (Gehrels 2000, Gehrels et al. 2008), which is a balance between the more accurate 206Pb*/207Pb* 

(assuming that discordance results from Pb-loss) and the more precise 206Pb*/238U age.  

  How to filter data in a detrital zircon study 

According to Gehrels 2011, there are generally four ways to filter data: (1) Based on the degree 

of discordance; (2) Based on clustering; (3) Based on a discordance weighting scheme; (4) Conducting 

multiple analysis in each grain. 

Filtering data based on the degree of discordance is used from the observations of the 

relationships between accuracy and precision of ages regarding Pb-loss and inheritance. For analysis 

that are discordant due to Pb-loss, all three ages are younger than the crystallization age, even the 

206Pb*/207Pb* age (which would be the more accurate; Fig.16). The inaccuracy of 206Pb*/207Pb* age 

increases with discordance and as the age of Pb-loss increases. If discordance results from inheritance, 

the 207Pb*/235U, 206Pb*/207Pb*and 206Pb*/238U ages have potential inaccuracy increasing with increasing 

discordance. Thus the appropriate level of discordance filter needs to be determined for each data set in 

light of the goals of the study and the complexities encountered (Fig. 17). For instance, in a study that 

yields important mix of Phanerozoic and Archean ages, it may be appropriate to apply a generous 

discordance cutoff (e.g. 30%) so that most Precambrian ages are retained. If the aim in the study is to 

test for a specific Archean age, it should either be used a tight discordance cutoff (e.g. 10%) or even 

only concordant ages. Finally, in a study that yields only young ages (e.g.&amp;lt;100 Ma), a discordance filter 

could not even be used due to the difficulty in determining reliable 206Pb*/207Pb* ages. Importantly, a 

discordance filter is not assured of yielding robust ages because Pb-loss soon after crystallization and/or 

inheritance of slightly older components will yield analysis that are analytically concordant but of 

inaccurate age.  

Filtering based on clustering is a method that places significance primarily on analysis that 

belong to a cluster, given that Pb-loss and inheritance always scatter analysis away from their true age. 

For instance, a cluster may be defined by three or more analysis that overlap at 2? uncertainty. Analysis 

that do not belong to a cluster may also be accurate, and are not discarded, but their true significance 

remains uncertain. Geherels (2011) shows more detail and an example of how to use the clustering filter. 

Filtering based on a discordance weighting scheme is a strategy suggested by Nemchin &amp;amp; 

Cawood (2005). The method is to weight each analysis according to degree of discordance such that 

highly discordant analysis contribute little age probability to the final age-distribution curve. In Figure 

18, a Concordia diagram showing strategy of using clustering and discordance filters to evaluate detrital 

zircon ages is presented. 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

62 

Finally, conducing multiple analysis on each grain increases the possibility to obtain reliable 

ages (Figure 19). When grains record Pb-loss, it is possible to identify domains where little Pb-loss have 

occurred (e.g. portions with low-U concentration) and/or to generate a Pb-loss trajectory with a robust 

upper intercept by using variable degrees of Pb-loss. Besides, in the case where there is multiple episodes 

of zircon growth, it is possible to determine a crystallization history rather than a single age (e.g. 

Geherels 2008).  

 

Figure 16 - Diagram showing that, for a mid-Proterozoic analysis with Pb loss, the 206Pb*=207Pb* age is more 

accurate than 206Pb*=238U and 207Pb*=235U ages. This is why 206Pb*=207Pb* ages should be used for samples in the 

~800-1400 Ma age range (assuming that discordance is due to Pb-loss), even though 206Pb*=238U ages are generally 

more precise (from Gehrels 2011 and references therein).  

 Evaluating the interpretations of discordant U-Pb ages 

Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad (1997) summarized and evaluated the interpretation of discordant U-Pb 

ages in zircon. They suggest that the understanding of the reasons and processes governing Pb-loss and 

the meaning of the lower intercept ages in the concordia diagram are at the center of the interpretation 

of discordant zircon U-Pb data. 

The interpretation of upper and lower intercepts of the discordia line with the concordia curve 

is much debated. The interpretation of upper intercepts is less controversial, being commonly interpreted 

to represent the time of zircon growth. The main issue when interpreting lower intercept ages is whether 

or not they represent a discrete geological event. Interpretations of those are often dependent on 

particular beliefs of each investigator on the reason for discordance. In this context, some two common 

reasons and interpretations are attributed for discordance. The first and simplest reason is the growth of 

new zircon around old cores, which is a recurrent phenomenon in igneous and high-grade metamorphic 

rocks. The simplest interpretation for this is that the upper intercept provides primary crystallization 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

63 

ages and the lower intercept the time of overgrowth formation, implying that old and new material 

remained always as closed systems. The second reason is that zircons lose more Pb than U as a result of 

a metamorphic event. In this case, it is commonly interpreted that the upper intercept represents the time 

of crystallization and the lower the time of a later thermal disturbance. Pb-loss would be caused only as 

temperatures increase in the thermal event by diffusion and/or recrystallization of damaged zircon. This 

would happen because Pb is much less compatible than U in zircon.  

 

Figure 17 - Concordia diagram showing strategy of using clustering and discordance filters to evaluate detrital 

zircon ages. (from Gehrels 2011 and references therein). For Precambrian ages, clusters are defined by analyses 

that yield similar 206Pb*=207Pb* ages (shown graphically with gray lines). Single analyses or pairs of analyses may 

yield useful information, but may be less reliable than analyses belonging to larger clusters. Application of an 

appropriate discordance filter (e.g., 10–30%) may further improve reliability of the final ages. For younger data 

(lower right inset), clusters are defined on the basis of 206Pb*=238U ages, with individual analyses or pairs of 

analyses interpreted to be less robust than analyses belonging to larger clusters. Application of a discordance filter 

for young ages is generally not possible because of the large uncertainty of 206Pb*=207Pb* ages for young grains. 

It is important to realize that in some cases application of a clustering filter may be ineffective in identifying robust 

ages. For example, if analyses lie along a discordance trajectory with ancient upper and lower intercepts (e.g., 

analysis shown in Fig. 17), both 206Pb*=238U and 206Pb*=207Pb* ages will be inaccurate and no clusters will be 

apparent. In such cases, application of a tight discordance filter (e.g., 10% or less) may be the only way to focus 

significance on the more robust analyses. Both discordance and clustering filters need to be applied with caution, 

and with full consideration of the complexities of the data and the objectives of the study.  

 

Figure 18 - Example of the power of using multiple small-volume analysis on a single grain to resolve a complex 

history of zircon growth. (from Gehrels 2011 and references therein). 

In contrast with both reasons presented above are the observations that even zircons from 

igneous intrusions that do not contain xenocrysts and have not been metamorphosed afterwards display

64 

discordant U-Pb zircon ages. Figure 20 shows an example of this. It is noted that the zircon analysis 

aligned in the discordia yields a lower intercept of questionable geological significance. Since zircons 

may behave this way for no obvious reasons, if zircons do align in a discordia because of a thermal 

overprint, there is no a priori reason why they should not become discordant again (i.e. move toward the 

origin of the Concordia diagram) without a geological event. This means that there is no reason to 

assume that zircons from metamorphic rocks have lost Pb only during a discrete event of metamorphism. 

Therefore, it seems possible that zircons can lose Pb without an event of metamorphism and that the two 

above mentioned interpretations may not reliably explain all discordant data.  

 

Figure 19 - Examples of analysis showing discordant U-Pb ages (modified from Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997). (a) 

Concordia diagram with a characteristic array of zircon data from an igneous intrusion that did not undergo any 

later thermal disturbance. The upper intercept age represents the time of intrusion and the lower intercept may 

have no geological meaning. (b) Characteristic array of zircons from a metamorphic rock. The strong discordance 

may be as a result of new overgrowth of zircon over old recrystallized cores. In order to evaluate the significance 

of the upper and the lower intercept it is necessary to separate core and rim material and to evaluate whether there 

was post metamorphic Pb-loss (see also Fig. 2). (c) Metamict zircons that recrystallize during medium to high 

grade metamorphism become strongly discordant. Such zircons are particularly difficult to interpret. For a valid 

interpretation of the upper and the lower intercept it is necessary to evaluate whether there was post metamorphic 

Pb-loss. Although such zircons may yield the approximate times of primary crystallization and later metamorphic 

overprint, the ages may be quite inaccurate in detail (see also Fig. 2). 

Understanding the causes for discordance is particularly relevant when studying rocks that have 

undergone more than one high-temperature event (magmatic or metamorphic). Information on all those 

events must come from the zircons for a reliable interpretation of data. Even though it is preferable to 

attempt to obtain concordant zircons (since there is less ambiguity in their interpretation), such material 

is not always available and ignoring discordant zircons can lead to ignoring important thermal events.  

In magmatic rocks that have not been affected by late thermal disturbance, many studies show 

that Pb-loss occurs more readily in zircon than in other minerals such as monazite and titanite in the 

same sample (e.g. Corfu et al. 1985). Those minerals clearly behave differently. Titanites and monazites 

from high-grade metamorphic rocks give U-Pb ages that are typically younger than zircon ages from the 

same sample or field area. This suggests that zircon has a higher initial closure temperature for Pb-

diffusion. Moreover, only zircons tend to become discordant subsequently, which means that there is a 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

65 

reason why zircons lose Pb more readly at low temperatures than in high temperatures. The most likely 

reason for low-temperature loss must be related to metamictization.  

 Metamictization and recrystallization 

Metamictization (=the destruction of zircon lattice) occurs because of the decay of U and Th in 

zircon that yields ?-particles and fission products that damage the crystal structure. Over the time, 

zircons approach the metamictic state, where they lose their crystallinity and approximate a glassy state. 

In or during the process of metamictization they are very susceptible to alteration, particularly if fluid is 

present. The interpretation that metamictization plays an important role in in the Pb-loss patterns of 

zircons is strongly related to the relationship between magnetic susceptibility, degree of discordance and 

U-content. Silver &amp;amp; Deutsch (1963) showed that most zircons with low U-content plot closer to the 

upper intercept on Concordia than zircons with high U-content, although this is not a rule. Besides, the 

least magnetic grains typically plot closest to the Concordia line and the most magnetic ones furthest 

away. This provides easy means to separate grains with different degrees of metamictization, which is 

crucial when distinguishing pristine from damaged zircon lattices for the interpretation of discordant 

patterns.  

Specific features in metamorphic and magmatic zircons support the suggestion that 

metamorphic zircons recrystallize during metamorphism if they are metamictic (Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 

1997):  

(1) zircons that grow in metamorphic rocks tend to have lower U-concentrations (a few 100 

p.p.m or less) than magmatic zircons (several 100 to several 1000 p.p.m.); 

(2) recrystallized zircons from metamorphic rocks tend to be typically rounded at their 

terminations because of partial dissolution resulting from recrystallization; 

(3) magmatic zircons tend to have large crystal faces and to be strongly zoned, whereas 

metamorphic zircons do not show well developed internal zoning.  

As the temperatures of metamorphism are much lower than the ones of magmatism, the lower 

zircon U-concentration in metamorphic zircons can be explained by the fact that the partition 

coefficients seem to favor lower U-concentrations in zircons growing in metamorphic rocks. Moreover, 

the U in the rock may not be available for reaction with newly growing zircon in metamorphic rocks. 

This implies that after formation or recrystallization of metamorphic zircons, their lower U-content 

slows down the process of metamictization and they are less likely to undergo Pb-loss (Mezger &amp;amp; 

Krogstad 1997). Another special feature commonly observed in metamorphic and magmatic zircons is 

that the Th/U ratio of the first is often ~0.01 or lower, when apparently the second has a value of &gt;0.5 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

66 

(e.g. Rubatto 2002). According to Hoskin &amp;amp; Schaltegger (2003), this behavior is not fully understood 

but might be due to the presence of a fluid during metamorphic crystallization and in some cases due to 

differential expulsion of cations from zircon during recrystallization. 

Many studies show that the recrystallization temperature of metamitctic zircons occurs around 

600-650 °C and that severe Pb-loss below middle amphibolite facies conditions seems less common 

(e.g. Lancelot et al. 1983). Experimental studies show that this may be attributed to leaching of Pb 

caused by the presence of fluids from metamictic zircon rather than from recrystallization. Around 500 

°C and under hydrothermal conditions, Pb is readly leached from metamictic zircons; at temperatures 

between 400-500 °C, it is observed only rearrangement of the damaged zircon lattice; and above 600 

°C, zircon recover their crystallinity rapidly under laboratory conditions (e.g. Farges 1994).  

There is evidence that zircons from igneous rocks that have not undergone later metamorphism 

or reheating tend to be discordant, but parts of them can stay concordant. Pristine and metamictic 

material seem to occur in the same crystal and seem to be characteristic for the typically magmatic 

zircon. Different techniques used for U-Pb zircon analysis corroborate this. Mechanical abrasion 

techniques (e.g. Goldich &amp;amp; Fischer 1986) are suiTable to remove preferentially the metamictic and softer 

parts of zircon. Abraded zircons from rocks with a simple geologic history provide more concordant 

data than unabraded grains. Likewise, the evaporation technique used to obtain 207Pb*/206Pb* ages from 

individual zircon grains (e.g. Kober 1987) corroborate that the zircon pristine parts remain concordant 

whereas the metamictic parts record Pb-loss. Using this technique in igneous and metamorphic zircons 

of simple history, with increasing temperature a constant age value can be reached. These “plateau ages” 

agree with the upper intercept obtained conventionally. In igneous rocks with a simple history, zircons 

generally plot close to the upper intercept with Concordia. In these cases, the abrasion technique 

provides zircon concordant ages and the evaporation technique provides reproducible plateau ages. Both 

of these can be interpreted as corresponding to the initial time of zircon formation. On the other hand, 

many zircons in metamorphic rocks lie closer to the lower intercept than to the upper intercept with 

concordia. In this case, it cannot be assumed that the lower intercept record a later metamorphic or 

thermal event. Since all igneous zircons lose Pb after its formation, it is likely that metamorphic zircons 

also could lose Pb after formation or recrystallization, which would not reflect any geological event. 

Therefore, the relationship between U-content, metamictization and thermal history have to be 

understood before interpreting any data. 

 Conditions for Pb-loss and examples 

As pointed out before, c. 600-650 °C is the annealing temperature of zircon to repair itself soon 

after structural damage has occurred, resulting in limited Pb-loss. Below this temperature, the damage 

to the zircon lattice over time increases the chance of Pb-loss. Thus, appreciable Pb-loss or partial

67 

resetting of zircons possibly occurs within a low temperature time interval in the rock history that allows 

sufficient time for metamictization. A study from Corfu &amp;amp; Ayres (1984) provides an instructive example 

of this. They obtained two distinct populations of zircon from one rock that experienced the same 

geological history. Population 1 had high U-content, defined upper intercept ages of about 2.720 Ga and 

lower intercept age of about 1750 Ga. The authors interpreted this last age to record a possible real low 

temperature event. The Pb-loss in the high-U zircons occurred much earlier than in population 2 because 

they were more metamictic. That allowed them to lose Pb continually or as a result of very low-grade 

overprint. Population 2 had low U-content, defined upper intercept ages of about 2.720 Ga and lower 

intercept age of about 380 Ma. The authors interpreted this last age to be meaningless. The low-U zircons 

lost less Pb because they are less metamictic. Those zircons lost Pb later because they needed much 

longer time to become metamictic, which is shown by the age of the lower intercept. 

Pb-loss can also occur by diffusion in zircon. In temperatures in excess of 1000 °C, Pb may 

diffuse slowly in the lattice during long geological periods. However, this Pb-difusion is practically an 

insignificant process for Pb-loss compared to appreciable amounts of Pb that are lost only from damaged 

zircons with the appropriate temperature history. This is possible and facilitated at medium to low 

temperatures, which allows damage accumulation in zircon lattice and enhance Pb movement.  

In short, it is suggested that Pb-loss is caused by at least four mechanisms: (1) diffusion in 

metamict zircon, (2) leaching from metamict zircon; (3) diffusion in pristine zircon and (4) 

recrystallization of metamict zircon. Therefore, in crust conditions Pb-loss occurs in partially to strong 

metamict zircons. 

 Causes for discordance 

The major causes for discordance in zircon result from alternating episodes of low (&lt;600–650 

°C) and high (&gt;600– 650 °C) temperatures that may produce multiple growth events of metamictization, 

recrystallization and thus Pb-loss. According to Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad (1997), the reasons for this are: 

(1) Radiogenic Pb-loss occurs easily from metamictic zircons because these materials have low binding 

energies, which explains zircon sensitivity to low temperatures and hydrothermal fluids.  

(2) During reheating and recrystallization of zircon, the metamictic parts will largely reject Pb from 

the new crystal whereas the pristine (or not strongly metamitctic) parts will keep most of their Pb. 

(3) Zircons that are constantly above the annealing temperature (600 – 650 °C) will have their lattice 

constantly repaired soon after metamictization and will stay concordant throughout their history.  

(4) For most zircons Pb-loss by diffusion is not an important process except for pristine zircons that 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

68 

equilibrated under mantle condition (&gt;1000 °C). In crustal environments, such as short-lived 

magmatic bodies, granulite or diamond facies, complete resetting of zircon by diffusion is not 

achieved. Therefore, once zircons have formed, they do not move along Concordia, even if they 

stayed at high temperatures for several years. Concordant zircons that spread along Concordia are 

most likely a result of multistage growth rather than Pb-diffusion.  

(5) Zircons will always provide crystallization ages (=upper intercept) and recrystallization ages 

(=lower intercepts) if they formed from a metamictic parent, rather than providing cooling ages. 

Subsequent modification in the U-Pb systematics will be due later episodes of metamictization at 

low temperatures or overgrowths. 

Therefore, in general, there are four temperature intervals for the history of zircons that must be 

taken into consideration for any interpretation: 

(1) Below c. 600 °C: zircons become metamictic and may lose Pb by chemical alteration, leaching and 

possibly diffusion in the metamictic material; 

(2) At or above 600-650 °C: Pb-loss occurs as a result of recrystallization of the zircon damaged lattice 

after heating of even partially metamictic; 

(3) From c. 650 °C to at least 1000 °C: there is no appreciable Pb-loss because Pb-diffusion in pristine 

zircon lattice is extremely slow; 

(4) Above at least 1000 °C: Pb-loss may occur slowly as a result of diffusion in zircon pristine lattice. 

Furthermore, under crustal conditions, it seems that the only way for zircon to become 

completely reset is through dissolution and subsequent reprecipitation. 

 Interpretation from magmatic zircons 

Even in magmatic rocks that have experienced no later thermal disturbance or deformation, only 

the upper intercept age be interpreted with confidence as geological significant. Because metamictic 

zircons are very sensitive to thermal disturbance, the cause for discordance may be a low temperature 

overprint that may be ignored. To insure that a lower intercept has a geological significance, other 

geochronological evidence has to corroborate that, such from phases with lower closure temperatures 

(e.g. Mezger 1990).  

 Interpretation from zircons in metamorphic rocks 

Metamorphic zircons, as defined by Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997 ((i.e. that grew as a result of a 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

69 

metamorphic reaction), should behave the same way as igneous zircons. This means that both can 

become discordant and only the upper intercept has a definite geological meaning. However, 

metamorphic rocks contain older preexisting zircons that have inherited material (i.e. metamorphosed 

zircons that formed during an earlier event and recrystallized during a thermal overprint, Mezger &amp;amp; 

Krogstad 1997). They tend to plot close to the lower intercept, closely defining it and creating a big 

uncertainty in the upper intercept because of the large extrapolation. Nonetheless, if there is zircon Pb-

loss during formation or recrystallization during a metamorphic episode, the lower intercept is too young 

and do not record a geological event. It can record, at best, minimum ages, unless there are others 

chronometers showing that this lower intercept is indeed a geological event, which is generally the last 

metamorphic episode (e.g. Machado et al. 1990). As new and more precise analytical techniques are 

being developed, a concerning question is how accurately this lower intercept can register the last 

metamorphic episode considering that even a slight disturbance after (re)crystallization can lead to 

misinterpretation of tectonic-metamorphic processes.  

When analysed together with zircon, others geochronometers such as monazite and titanite can 

help elucidate much of the upper and lower intercept significance. In igneous rocks with a simple history, 

monazites and titanites, which have closure temperatures &gt; 600 °C, tend to yield similar or lower ages 

than the upper intercept given by zircon. In metamorphic rocks where zircons are used to determine a 

lower intercept given by discordia, monazite and titanite ages can be similar or older than those given 

by this lower intercept and thus are often used to constrain it more precisely. Conversely, in high-grade 

terranes, monazite and titanite closure temperatures are well under peak temperatures of metamorphism 

and it is expected that zircon growth or Pb-diffusion terminated even earlier than peak, if it ever occurred 

at all. In such cases, using monazite and titanite combined with zircon to determine a lower intercept is 

only accepted if the cooling rates are known to have been rapid compared with the uncertainty of the 

mineral phases. In this case, minerals with lower closure temperatures will provide a less ambiguous 

age of metamorphism than zircon. Thus, in an ideal case, the lower intercept age defined by 

recrystallized or newly grown zircon around old cores is only meaningful if it is older than the ages of 

accessory minerals with closure temperatures below the peak conditions. This assumes that zircon does 

not grow during retrograde P-T path. 

In high-grade metamorphic rocks, it is very common that zircon data will plot approximately 

halfway between the lower and upper intercept. This data is particularly difficult to interpret and most 

probably results from recrystallization of preexisting metamictic grains that become homogeneous and 

without pronounced zonation. It is possible that in such cases, neither the upper nor the lower intercepts 

have a geological significance. The upper intercept can be too old (or too young, Gebauer &amp;amp; 

Grünenfelder 1979) and the lower intercept can be too old than the last metamorphic overprint (Fig. 20). 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

70 

As the history of zircons in a dataset is often complex, especially in metamorphic rocks, it is 

difficult to reconstruct the U-content prior to the last recrystallization event and thus essential 

information on the early rock history is not available. Because of these complexities in zircon 

systematics, in the ideal case it would be better to use only the concordant zircons. However, this may 

lead an oversight of important thermal episodes. Interpreting the lower intercept as a metamorphic age 

is accepTable because metamorphic and metamorphosed zircons tend to have low U-concentrations 

(less than c. 100 p.p.m.) compared to most igneous zircons, as stated previously. Therefore, in these 

zircons, the radiation damage may not be sufficient to cause substantial Pb-loss. If reproducible U-Pb 

ages from differentially abraded zircons can be found, there is strong evidence that Pb-loss has not 

occurred, that inherited material is absent, and that these are meaningful ages. These ages can be 

validated by analysing a mineral with high closure temperatures, such as monazite. In rocks that formed 

above the closure temperature of monazite, the lower intercept defined by zircon should yield an age 

older than the monazite age. In fact, because pristine zircon has a higher closure temperature of the U-

Pb system than monazite, the zircon age should never be younger than the monazite age (Mezger &amp;amp; 

Krogstad 1997). 

 

Figure 20 - Interpretation of zircons that became strongly discordant as a result of a high grade metamorphic 

overprint can be particularly difficult. As shown in this diagram primary zircons lost some Pb because of 

metamictization. Then, in the above example, a high grade metamorphism affects the zircons at the present time. 

Since zircons with a high U-content become the most metamict they may also lose the most Pb during this last 

thermal overprint when the crystals recrystallize. This can result in a rotation of the data array as a result of 

differential Pb loss following the arrows. If there was no zircon material that remained concordant since the first 

crystallization the resulting discordia line can yield an upper it and a lower intercept age that have no geological 

significance (modified from Mezger &amp;amp; Krogstad 1997).

CHAPTER 4  

MELTING OF THE CONTINENTAL CRUST – A SUMMARY 

It is generally agreed that crustal melting generates granitic magmas at high temperatures that 

equate the conditions of upper amphibolite- to granulite-facies metamorphism (Clemens 2006). Thus it 

is inferred that the differentiation of crust is a consequence of the generation of granulite-facies rocks 

and production and withdrawal of partial melts (e.g. Clemens 1990; Thompson 1990). Although various 

intracrustal processes occurring during tectonic thickening and orogenic collapse of the crust may cause 

partial melting, granulite-facies conditions of metamorphism and granitic magma production generally 

require additional, extra-crustal heat sources be available to drive the reactions (Clemens 2006). These 

conditions are commonly achieved by advection of mantle heat to the continental crust, through heat 

vectors that are most likely to be underplated and intraplated mafc magmas (Clemens 2006). Another 

local alternative would be that the source crust was unusually enriched in heat-producing elements. Two 

major consequences arise from these. First, the deep crust will become mafic, partially dehydrated, 

restitic, ande denser, which may eventually hamper their exposure at the surface (Clemens 1990; 

Thompson 1990). For such exposure, the rocks may need a second major tectonic episode that enables 

them to eventually outcrop. Second, the upper crust will become enriched in felsic minerals and heat-

producing elements (Clemens 2006). 

High temperature metamorphism and partial melting may occur under three main fluid regimes: 

(1) fluid-dominated (high fluid/rock ratio), where the composition of the fluid phase will control both 

the activities of volatile components and the nature of the reaction and trigger reactions; (2) rock-

dominated (low fluid/rock ratio), where the fluid will initially control the activities of volatile 

components and trigger reactions that will subsequently modify the fluid compositions; (3) fluid absent, 

where most grain boundaries are effectively “dry” and the only significant reactions that may occur are 

those that do not require the presence of a free fluid phase (Clemens 2006).  

Many studies suggest that, at high-T conditions (T &gt; 800°C), fluid-absent reactions dominate 

during most crustal melting and production of mobile, large-volume granitic magmas (e.g. Stevens &amp;amp; 

Clemens 1993; Clemens &amp;amp; Watkins 2001). The major types of fluid-absent reactions depend on the 

protolith mineralogy and temperature. Numerous experimental studies suggest some simplified 

reactions observed on a range of common crustal rocks (Clemens 2006, references therein). The most 

important ones for the matter of this study are those occurring in metapelites and metagreywackes. In 

metapelites, simplified reations are (abbreviations after Kretz 1983; melt = H2O understaured granitic 

melt): 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

72 

Ms ± Bt + Pl + Qtz = Als ± Grt ± Kfs + melt (amphibolite facies); and 

Bt + Pl + Als + Qtz = Grt ± Crd ± Kfs + melt (upper amphibolite to granulite facies). 

In alumina-poor metagreywackes and quartzofeldspathic rocks, reactions are: 

Bt + Pl +Qtz = Hbl + Cpx ± Kfs + melt (upper amphibolite to granulite facies); and 

Bt ± Hbl + Pl + Qtz = Opx + Cpx ± Grt ± Kfs ± melt (granulite facies). 

In peraluminous metagreywackes: 

Bt + Pl + Qtz = Opx ± Grt ± Crd ± Kfs + melt (granulite facies). 

Notably, major crustal melting in peraluminous metasedimentary protoliths involves muscovite 

then biotite breakdown producing high-grade assemblages that commonly bear peritectic sillimanite, 

garnet, cordierite and orthopyroxene (e.g., Brown 2007; Taylor et al. 2014). These assemblages and the 

proportion of melt produced by those reactions depend on P-T conditions and protolith compositions, 

where different protholiths will produce different melt volumes (Brown 2007, Korhonen et al. 2010). 

Predictive modeling of protolith fertility (Clemens &amp;amp; Vielzeuf 1987; Johannes &amp;amp; Holtz 1990) suggests 

that metagreywackes may represent the optimum rock compositions for high-scale granitic melt 

production, although pelites are also highly fertile (and may sometimes be more so than 

metagreywackes). Other rock-types, such as intermediate to felsic quartzofeldspathic rocks and mafic 

rocks, are far less fertile (Clemens 2006). 

Migmatitic and granulitic terranes in orogenic belts that record thickening before maximum 

temperatures are achieved typically display clockwise P-T paths (Brown 1994). Within this path, 

metamorphic peak is achieved during prograde heating, which is followed by near-isothermal 

decompression and posterior close to isobaric cooling (Yakymchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014). With increasing 

temperature, deformation and volume of melt produced, a dynamic rheological environment is created. 

Rosenberg &amp;amp; Handy (2005) suggest that melt may escape from the source when its volume achieves the 

melt connectivity transition (~7 vol %), in the first of several melt loss events. Conversely, some authors 

suggest that fracture controlled systems may allow melt to escape essecially instantaneous on melt 

formation or soon after anatexis (e.g., Taylor et al. 2014, Villaros et al. 2009). In any of the cases, as 

H2O strongly partitions into the melt, melt isolation and loss creates a system where no free H2O-rich 

volatile phase attends high-grade metamorphism (Brown &amp;amp; Korhonen 2009). Subsequently, this allows 

for the preservation of high-grade (peritectic) assemblages with residual compositions and minor 

evidence of retrogression (Brown 2004; Brown &amp;amp; Korhonen 2009). Furthermore, melt loss will create 

anisotropy due to differences in rheology and permeability amongst residues (Korhonen et al. 2010). 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

73 

Subsequent melt loss events reduce the potential for melt production creating anisotropic residual 

domains with increased mechanical strength and decreased permeability (Korhonen et al. 2010). Over 

time, this may modify the anatectic zone by moving the solidus isotherm upward and downward in the 

crust. Although the anatectic front (at the top of the anatectic zone) will likely shallow during the later 

stages of syn-deformational prograde heating and deepen during retrograde cooling (Brown and 

Korhonen 2009), this will be strongly dependent on the chemistry and mechanical hetereogeneity of the 

source. Consequently, high-grade terranes may represent zones of melt generation, transfer and 

accumulation for melts derived from deeper crutal levels (Brown 2004, Korhonen et al. 2010).  

The link between assemblages and common accessory minerals in migmatites and granulites, 

such as zircon and monazite, have the potential to constrain the P-T evolution of the rocks through time. 

Accessory mineral growth can be linked to a particular part of the P-T path, specific metamorphic 

reactions and particular coexisting minerals, allowing for rates of orogenic processes and times of events 

to be constrained (e.g. Korhonen et al. 2013, Rubatto 2002, Hermann &amp;amp; Rubatto 2003, Rubatto et al. 

2006, 2013, Baldwin &amp;amp; Brown 2008). Phase equilibria modelling of open-system melting for clockwise 

P-T paths shows that some zircon is expected to survive prograde heating followed by isothermal 

decompression, whereas monazite may be completely consumed. Subsequent cooling to the solidus 

should allow only limited growth of these minerals from trapped melt along grain boundaries 

(Yakymchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014). Furthermore, weighted mean ages among migmatite and granulite 

samples might reflect the timing of final crystallization of trapped melt at the solidus and differences 

between samples might signify changes in the solidus temperature according to the degree of melt 

depletion (Korhonen et al. 2013, Yakymchuck &amp;amp; Brown 2014).

CHAPTER 5  

WHOLE ROCK CHEMISTRY 

Bulk-compositions from samples in this study and from compiled data shown in Figure 21 are 

presented in Table 12 (normalised to 100 wt% on an anhydrous basis). Figure 21(a) shows Al2O3–

Fe2O3(T)–MgO and CaO–K2O–Na2O ternary plots of metasedimetary rocks from the NVC obtained in 

this study and other NVC natural samples obtained from compiled data (Gradim 2013). Relevant 

samples 101, 7A1B, 3A1 and FMC-10 are highlighted and represent the main rock-types in this study: 

Grt – Bt ± Crd metagreywacke (101), Bt – Grt – Opx metagreywacke (7A1B) and Crd ± Grt 

metagreywacke (3A1 and FMC10). Important common characteristics of the highlighted samples in this 

study are that they are Al-rich rocks that have relatively high SiO2 contents (Appendix B.2): 74.37wt% 

(3A1); 63.59wt% (FMC10); 62.44wt% (7A1B); and 71.63wt% (101). Figure 21(a) shows that, amongst 

those samples, the Al2O3:Fe2O3:MgO ratio ranges from aprox. 8:1:1 to 5:4:1 whereas the CaO: 

K2O:Na2O ratio ranges from aprox. 7:1:2 to 1:8:1. Sample 3A1 has a Al2O3:Fe2O3:MgO ratio of aprox. 

7:2:1 and a CaO:K2O:Na2O ratio of aprox. 3:4:3, which is reflected by the presence of abundant 

cordierite and feldspar in the rock, with other smaller contributions from silimanite and hercynite. 

Compared to garnet-absent, biotite-poor sample 3A1, sample FMC10 (from the same location) has lower 

Al2O3, higher Fe2O3 and higher K2O contents, which is reflected by its higher contents of biotite, garnet 

and magnetite. Cordierite granulite samples from compiled data plots closer to sample FMC10 than to 

3A1. Samples 101 and 7A1B have Al2O3:Fe2O3:MgO ratios varying from aprox. 6:3:1 to 5:3:2 and have 

CaO:K2O:Na2O ratios varying from aprox. 3:4:3 to 5:2:3, respectively. Sample’s 101 relatively higher 

K2O concentration is reflected by higher biotite contents with respect to other modelled samples 7A1B 

and 3A1. Sample 7A1B is depleted in K2O with respect to CaO and Na2O, which is reflected by the high 

amounts of plagioclase in the rock.  

The ternary diagrams shown in Figure 21 (b) delineate a relationship between the studied NVC 

samples and possible protoliths (similarly to Nicoli et al. 2014). The diagrams contain Al2O3, Fe2O3, 

MgO, CaO, Na2O and K2O compositions of possible protoliths ((meta)greywackes and (meta)pelites 

from compiled data (Table 12) compared to compositions of relevant samples in this study. From these 

data, the diagrams show that (meta)greywackes are generally more ferromagnesian and depleted in K2O 

than (meta)pelites, which are generally more Al- and K-rich. However, there is a compositional overlap 

between their compositions that encompasses plots of samples in this study. The Al2O3– Fe2O3(T)–MgO 

diagram shows that: (1) sample 3A1 plots within the compositional overlap between (meta)pelites and 

peraluminous (meta)greywackes, although there is an Al-depletion between 3A1 and some (meta)pelites 

and peraluminous (meta)greywackes; (2) samples 101 and FMC10 are generally depleted in Al in 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

76 

relation to (meta)pelites and peraluminous (meta)greywackes; (3) sample 7A1B show a significant 

depletion in Al in relation to most (meta)pelites and peraluminous (meta)greywackes. The CaO– K2O – 

Na2O diagram shows that: (1) Sample FMC10 have a small K-depletion in comparison to most other 

samples; (2) samples 101 and 3A1 have a general K-depletion compared to most (meta)pelites and plot 

within the range of K-poor (meta)greywackes; (3) sample 7A1B have a strong K-depletion compared to 

all samples in this study and to (meta)pelites and (meta)greywackes. Thus there is a general depletion 

in Al and K of all samples compared to possible protoliths; they all have relatively high SiO2 contens; 

and they all contain variable amounts of garnet, cordierite and orthopyroxene. Considering that 

greywackes are sandstones containing 15-50% matrix (clay and silt) components (Pettijohn 1975), the 

above mentioned observations suggest that, if their protoliths were mica-rich (peraluminous) 

metagreywackes, the rocks must have lost melt to become restitic in character. Moreover, it indicates 

that their peraluminous greywacky protoliths probably contained different amounts of matrix 

components (i.e. pelitic portions), where sample 7A1B had the lowest amounts and samples 

3A1/FMC10 the highest.

the studied NVC samples and possible protoliths ((meta)greywackes and (meta)pelites). (Meta)pelite compostions of 

unmetamorphosed to amphibolite grade rocks were compiled from Ague (1991), Stevens et al. (1997), Vielzeuf &amp;amp; Holloway 

(1988), Patiño Douce &amp;amp; Johnston (1991), Pickering &amp;amp; Johnston (1998) and Patiño Douce &amp;amp; Harris (1998). (Meta)greywacke 

compositions from unmetamorphosed to amphibolite grade rocks were compiled from Stevens et al. (1997), Vielzeuf &amp;amp; Montel 

(1994), Patiño-Douce &amp;amp; Beard (1995, 1996), Pettijohn (1963) and Sawyer (1986). The seven samples from the last two 

mentioned studies represent peraluminous greywackes which compositions were used for metamorphic modeling by Johnson 

et al. (2008). See appendix B.2 for more details on the nature of compiled data.

CHAPTER 6  

SEDIMENTATION, METAMORPHISM AND GRANITE GENERATION 

IN A BACK-ARC REGION: RECORDS FROM THE EDIACARAN 

NOVA VENÉCIA COMPLEX (ARAÇUAÍ OROGEN, SOUTHEASTERN 

BRAZIL) 

 

ABSTRACT 

The Nova Venécia migmatite-granulite-granite Complex (NVC) in the core of the Araçuaí Orogen (AO, 

630-480 Ma), southeast Brazil, exposes a mid-crustal section with abundant evidence for production, 

extraction and emplacement of peraluminous melts. In this study we combine U-Pb geochronology and 

metamorphic petrology to constrain the evolution of the NVC migmatites-granulites from deposition to 

high-grade metamorphism, and to correlate the metamorphic history of the terrain with the several 

episodes of granite magmatism (G1-G5) in the AO. The sedimentation of the NVC can be bracketed 

within at least a 16 Ma period, between its maximum depositional age at ca. 606 Ma and the intrusion 

of early syn-collisional granitoids at 593 Ma. Compilation of available U-Pb data shows that the bulk of 

the magmatic rocks in the AO (G1 + G2 rocks) crystallized contemporaneously over a period of 15 My 

(ca. 595-570 Ma) with a peak at ca. 575 Ma. Altough it is inferred a protacted period of crustal heating 

in the AO (from ca. 640-480), U-Pb ages of metamorphic and magmatic zircons and monazites suggest 

at least two major heat pulses with partial melting of the AO rocks at ca. 593-560 and 523-495 Ma. The 

peak of regional metamorphism is constrained from 575 to 560 Ma, which temporally overlaps with the 

magmatic crystallization of the youngest G1 + G2 granitoids. Thermodynamic modeling indicates that 

all metasedimentary samples record a similar P-T path, from P-T peak conditions of 750-850 °C and 

5300-7500 bars (granulite, depths of ~25 km) to stability of preserved assemblages of 640-800 °C and 

4500-6000 bars (transition between upper amphibolite to granulite, depths of ~18 km). The post-

collisional G5 thermal event (ca. 500 Ma), related to decompression and tectonic collapse of the AO, is 

recorded in metagreywackes (monazite U-Pb) and in granites (monazite and zircon U-Pb) from 523 to 

495 Ma. We suggest that the metagreywackes had already been subjected to some decompression and 

cooling by that time, based on metamorphic modelling, field observations and dating of a late 

undeformed dyke (at 518 Ma) that sharply intrudes the NVC. We link this second high-grade 

metamorphic event to the intrusion of large norite bodies that crystalized betwen ca. 520-480 Ma. In 

addition to monazite U-Pb ages, the main record of this event in metagreywackes is a partial LP-HT 

overprinting in regional peak assemblages, with generation of texturally late cordierite and hercynitic 

spinel.

6.1 - Introduction 

Investigating the main processes governing crustal anatexis in orogenic belts help us elucidate 

the tectonic evolution of old and recent crust and ultimately leads to a better understanding of Earth’s 

crustal evolution through time. Terrains such as the Fosdick Complex, West Antarctica (e.g., Korhonen 

et al. 2012), the Broken Hill Block, NSW Australia (e.g., White et al. 2004), the Ivrea Zone, Italy, 

(Barboza &amp;amp; Bergantz 2000), and the Limpopo Belt, South Africa (e.g., Stevens &amp;amp; Van Reenen 1992, 

Nicoli et al. 2014, Taylor et al. 2014) have provided a valuable wealth of information on a variety of 

processes including melting, melt extraction and emplacement and more significantly crustal 

differentiation (Brown 2007, 2013). One important crustal segment in South America that still lacks 

detailed investigation is the core of the Araçuaí Orogen (AO, Figure 1) in southeast Brazil. This 

metamorphic core exposes a nearly continuous crustal section from mid-crustal anatectic migmatites 

and granulites in the south to progressively shallow-level granitoid plutons and pegmatites towards the 

north (Pedrosa Soares et al. 2011). Particularly, migmatites and granulites of the Nova Venecia Complex 

(NVC; Fig. 1) are exposed through an extensive area of the AO core and preserve a range of high-grade 

mineral assemblages with little evidence for retrogression. They are exposed in close association with 

voluminous peraluminous and metaluminous granitoids that represent pre-, syn- and post-collisonal 

periods in the Araçuaí orogeny (630-480 Ma, Pedrosa Soares et al. 2011). However, no previous study 

has attemped to contrain the nature of these migmatites and the association between high grade 

metamorphism and the magmatic phases that occur in the complex.  

This study uses field-based observations, petrography, mineral chemistry, U-Pb LA-ICP-MS 

geochronology in zircon and monazite and thermodynamic modeling (using pseudosections) in order 

to: 1) constrain the P-T evolution of samples; 2) establish why the high-grade rocks record different 

mineral assemblages; 3) determine a possible source or different sources for high-grade 

metasedimentary samples based on geochronology; and 4) correlate metamorphic events to intrusion of 

igneous bodies occurring in close association with the sampled high-grade rocks.  

6.2 - Geological setting 

The Brasiliano-Pan African amalgamation of West Gondwana generated a large orogenic 

system that is today exposed to the south of the São Francisco and Congo cratons in eastern South 

America and western Africa. In South America (Brazil and Uruguay), this orogenic segment comprises 

the Araçuaí Orogen, the Ribeira Fold Belt (RFB) and the Dom Feliciano Belt (DFB), which compose 

the Mantiqueira Province. In western Africa the orogenic segment comprises the West-Congo Belt, the 

Kaoko Belt, the Damara Belt and the Gariep Belt. These complementary orogenic components were 

amalgamated during the closure of the Adamastor Ocean (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1998) and the Khomas

Ocean (Gray et al. 2008) in the Neoproterozoic-Lower Paleozoic, and were broken apart by the 

Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting. Prior to break up, the São Francisco and Congo Cratons remained 

connected since the Amazonian-Eburnian Cycle (2300-1900 Ma) by the so-called Bahia-Gabão Bridge 

(Porada 1989). The Araçuaí-West Congo segment was formed as a confined orogenic system within an 

embayment of the São Francisco-Congo Craton, which hosted a gulf of the Adamastor Ocean (Fig. 2; 

Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001).  

 

Figure 1 - Map of the Araçuaí Orogen and the study area (modified from Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007). 

The NVC is located in the high grade and crystalline core of the Araçuaí Orogen, one of the ten 

structural domains of the Araçuaí-West Congo Orogen (AWCO, Alkmim et al. 2006). Figure 2 

illustrates the evolution of the AWCO in five stages (Alkmim et al. 2006). In this model, most of the 

geodynamical stages are associated with production and emplacement of five main pre- to post-

86 

collisional granitoid Supersuites known as G1 to G5 (Table 1; e.g. Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006, 2011) 

and with deposition to metamorphism of metassedimentary rocks in the AO belts and core.  

Stage 1 (Fig. 2) records a continental rift phase (1000-660 Ma, e.g. Pedrosa-Soares and Alkmim 

2011, Silva et al. 2008, Queiroga et al. 2007) that created a narrow inland-sea basin to the south of 

latitude 18°S (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1998) where the units of the Macaúbas Group were deposited. 

Stage 2 (pre-collisional, 630-575 Ma; Fig 2) involved tectonic convergence of the two passive 

margins at ca. 630 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, Silva et al. 2005a), when the São-Francisco 

Peninsula started to rotate anti-clockwise, leading to compression of the Macaúbas basin, subduction of 

the oceanic crust underneath the Congo Continent and construction of a magmatic arc. The G1 granitoid 

Supersuite is believed to have been generated during convergence (630-585 Ma) as the plutonic part of 

the arc (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011).  

Stage 3 (syn-collisional, 585-560 Ma; Fig 2) began with the collision and development of a 

double-verging external fold-thrust belt towards the São Francisco Craton to the east and the Congo 

Craton to the west (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001). This stage was marked by the emplacement of the G2 

Supersuite between 585 and 560 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011) and anatexis of the paragneisses in the 

NVC. The migmatitic paragneisses (i.e. NVC) contain a Sn foliation that is only observed in specific 

G2 granitic plutons, which are interpreted to be coeval with the ductile deformation generated by the 

collisional phase in both rock-types (Roncato 2009).  

Stages 4 (560-535 Ma) and 5 (520-490 Ma) record the lateral scape of the southern part of the 

belt due to space problems as the convergence between the landmasses continued, promoting the 

tectonic collapse of the central part of the orogen (Alkmim et al. 2006). The G3 (545-525 Ma) Supersuite 

is inferred to have formed during a late- to post-collisional orogenic stage whereas the G4 (530-500 Ma) 

and G5 (520-480 Ma) Supersuites are interpreted to have formed during a post-collisional stage and 

orogenic collapse (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006, 2008, 2011; Table 1).

6.3 - Previous studies on the NVC and related rocks 

The core of the AO comprises the following granitoid and metasedimentary units: (1) the Rio 

Doce Group, which records components of a volcano-plutonic-sedimentary system, accreted to an active 

continental margin during a pre-collisional stage of the Araçuaí West-Congo Orogen (Vieira 2007, 

Peixoto et al. 2014); (2) the granitoid Supersuites G1 to G5 (Table 1); (3) the Jequitinhonha Complex, 

which consists of peraluminous migmatitic paragneisses located north of the NVC (Fig. 1; Gonçalves-

Dias et al. 2011) and (4) the NVC, which consists essentially of peraluminous migmatites, granulites 

and of calc-silicate rocks (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006). The main rock-types in the NVC are cordierite-

rich granulites and biotite + garnet ± cordierite ± orthopyroxene ± sillimanite migmatitic paragneisses 

(Roncato 2009, Gradim 2013). Altough there is a lack of more detailed studies on the NVC 

metamorphism, some studies report that the paragneisses were metamorphosed under upper amphibolite 

to granulite facies (e.g. Munhá et al. 2005, Gradim 2013). Qualitative estimations from biotite-garnet 

gneisses and cordierite granulites point to metamorphism under amphibolite to granulite facies transition 

(Gradim 2013). Preliminary thermobarometry data from paragneisses assemblages are 5 to 6.1 kbar at 

712º to 930º C (Gradim 2013) and 6.5 ± 0.5 kbar at 820 ± 30 ºC (maximum P-T conditions; Munhá et 

al. 2005). The suggested age of peak metamorphism in the NVC is 575 Ma (Gradim et al. 2014). In the 

northern Rio de Janeiro State (RFB), Bento dos Santos et al. (2011) suggested that peak P-T conditions 

of 8 ± 1 kbar and 850 ± 50?C developed synchronously with high-temperature deep thrusts and shear 

zones, followed by a clockwise P-T-t retrograde path characterised by cooling and decompression to ca. 

500°C and 5 kbar. 

6.4 - Methodology 

In this study, 29 samples were separated for microscopy and petrographic characterization from 

eight outcrops located in the Espírito Santo State, Brazil (Figure 3; Table 2). Three metasedimentary 

samples (101, 7A1B and 3A1) were chosen for metamorphic modelling based on their whole rock 

chemistry, mineral chemistry and petrography. U-Pb LA-Q-ICP-MS zircon and monazite 

geochronology data were obtained from metasedimentary samples 3A1, 101, 7A1B, 114 and granitoid 

samples 7B, 7B. 

The U/Pb data was collected with a New Wave UP-213 coupled with a mass spectrometer 

Agilent 7700x in the Geology Department of the University of Ouro Preto. In-situ monazite dating was 

performed in sample 114 at the Central Analytical Facility in Stellenbosch University, South Africa, 

LA-Q-ICP-MS. For detailed descriptions of the analytical method please refer to Appendices A.2 and 

A.3 and Appendices B.2 and B.3 for U/Pb data. Uncertainties on single spot ages are given at 1? 

uncertainties; uncertainties on weighted mean or concordia ages of populations are given at 2?

uncertainties. The data is presented using density concordia diagrams constructed by cumulatively 

adding the normalized probability density functions (PDF's) of each individual analysis according to 

their calculated mean values and 2? uncertainties (Figure 9). The PDF of each individual spot analysis 

was calculated using the equation for a bi-variate normal distribution with correlated errors, using the 

DensityDist code of Pullen et al. (2014) which incorporates a mathematical approach similar to that 

described in detail by Sircombe (2006). Each of the diagrams in Fig. 9 contains Concordia and mean 

ages calculated using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003). Traditional concordia diagrams presenting the 

individual ellipses of each analysis at 95% confidence are provided as supplementary material to this 

article (Appendix C.1).

The metamorphic conditions in peak and preserved assemblages in three samples of the NVC 

were investigated using numerous quantitative T-MFe2O3, T-MH2O, T-MMelt, P-MMelt and P-T 

pseudosections. Calculations were undertaken in the chemical system Na2O–CaO–K2O–FeO–MgO–

Al2O3–SiO2–H2O–TiO2–Fe2O3 (NCKFMASHTO) using THERIAK-DOMINO software (de Capitani 

and Petrakakis, 2010), in combination with the up-dated Holland &amp;amp; Powell (1998) dataset. The 

modelling uses the a-x relationships of White et al. (2007) for silicate melt; White et al. (2002) for 

orthopyroxene, spinel and magnetite; Holland and Powell (2003) for K-feldspar and plagioclase; White 

et al. (2000, 2005) for ilmenite; White et al. (2005) for garnet and biotite; Holland and Powell (1998) 

for cordierite. The dataset was compiled for Theriak-Domino by Doug Tinkham. The mineral 

abbreviations are as follows: Ms - white mica; Bt - biotite; Grt - garnet; Opx - orthopyroxene; Crd - 

cordierite; Ky - kyanite; Sil - sillimanite; And - andalusite; Pl - plagioclase; Kfs  - K-feldspar; Ilm -

(CGG-FMC10), represented by sample FMC10 collected from outcrop FMC10. 

In the next subsections we provide a detailed description of these main lithotypes and the 

anatectic features of each locality from where they were collected. 

 Outcrops 10 and 11 

Outcrops 10 and 11 are located in the city of Colatina (Fig. 3). Both outcrops expose a gently 

folded stromatic migmatite, where leucosomes and melanosomes are, in general, spaced regularly and 

oriented parallel to the foliation largely defined by biotite (Fig. 4 (a-1)). This banded sequoence may 

relate to the protolith structure. Melanosomes containing 1 cm fine-grained garnet are in contact with 

leucossomes containing 2-3 cm medium- and coarse-grained garnet (Fig. 4(a-2)). The melanosomes, 

represented by BGCM-101, contain biotite – garnet – K-feldspar – plagioclase – quartz – cordierite – 

sillimanite – ilmenite. Melanosomes represented by BGCM-114 are composed by the same minerals 

except for cordierite. Leucosomes locally cross-cut the foliation, forming a network of interconnected 

leucosomes (Fig. 4 (a-1)).

Figure 4 - Anatectic features of the high-grade rocks in outcrop-scale. (a) Outcrop 10. (a-1) Most of the exosure 

consists of a metatexite with leucocratic layers that are folded and parallel to the foliation. Locally, felsic 

segregations cross-cut the foliation (a-4). (a-2) Garnet is present both in leucosomes and melanosomes (sample 

BGCM-101). (b) Outcrop 7. (b-1) The outcrop exposes a stromatic (locally folded) metatexite, which bears 

leucocratic segregations and granitoid intrusions with variable structural and anatectic features. (b-2) Garnet and 

orthopyroxene are present both in leucosomes and melanosomes (sample BGOM-7A1B). (b-3) Granitic balloon-

shaped dyke intrudes the stromatic migmatite and shows sharp contacts with the host-rock (sample G-7B). (b-4) 

Specific granitoid intrusions have been affected by solid-state deformation and have a foliation oriented parallel 

to the main layering. There is evidence they have also been affected by partial melting (sample PG-7D). (c) 

Outcrops 3 and FMC-10. (c-1) Outcrop FMC-10 exposes a diatexite with a network of interconnected leucocratic 

segregations. Approximately 50% of the outcrop exposes the melanosome and 50% leucosomes + mesocratic 

neosomes. (c-2) Nebulitic leucosome and foliation-paralel mesocratic neosome in outcrop 3, hosted by the

melanosome (samples CG-3A1 and CG-3A4). (c-3) In outcrop FMC10, garnet and cordierite are present both in 

leucosomes and melanosomes (sample CGG-FMC10). (c-4) Garnet-shaped cordierite in the leucosome. 

 Outcrop 7  

Oucrop 7 is located near the community of Vila Fartura (Fig. 3). The outcrop (Fig. 4 (b-1)) 

primarily consists of a stromatic metatexite where the layering of garnet-bearing leucosomes and 

melanosome are oriented parallel to the biotite foliation. The mineral assemblage in melanossomes, 

represented by BGOM-7A1B, is biotite – garnet – K-feldpar – plagioclase – quartz ± orthopyroxene ± 

pyrite ± ilmenite. Rarely, cordierite is present as part of the melanosome, as represented by 

metasedimentary sample 7C. Orthopyroxene and ubiquitous medium- to coarse-grained garnet are 

present both in leucossomes and melanosomes, where they are commonly associated (Fig.4 (b-2)).  

Four different types of broadly granitic segregations occur at this locality. First, large (&gt;1 m 

wide) cross-cutting garnet-bearing intrusions with a foliation parallel to the stromatic metaxite. This 

lithotype is represented by PG-7D (Fig. 4 (b-4)), which consists of a biotite- and garnet-bearing 

granodiorite containing leucosomes concordant to the migmatite layering (indicating it was also affected 

by anatexis). Second, garnet-bearing, balloon-shaped dykes that cross-cut the stromatic migmatite with 

sharp contacts and show no evidence of solid-state deformation. This lithotype is represented by G-7B 

(Fig. 4 (b-3)), which consists of coarse-grained quartz-feldspar granite containing a relatively low 

volume of fine-grained garnet crystals. Third, garnet-rich leucosomes with patchy morphologies 

seemingly connected with stromatic leucosomes. Fourth, a large vein-structured leucogranitic dyke that 

cross-cuts the migmatitic layering. 

 Outcrops 3 and FMC10 

The locality encompassing outcrops 3 and FMC10 is near the city of Nova Venécia (Fig. 3), less 

than 4 km distant from the 15 km wide G5 Pedra do Elefante Batolith (biotite-granite and charnockite; 

Roncato 2009). The outcrops were studied in combination because of their similarities and close spatial 

association. The sole difference between them is that in outcrop 3 garnet is rarely observed whereas in 

outcrop FMC10 garnet is locally present in patchy leucosomes and melanosomes. Both outcrops expose 

a diatexite dominated by networks of interconnected leucosomes and mesocratic neosomes hosted by 

the melanocratic portion of the exposure (Fig. 4 (c-1)). Leucosomes consist of K-feldspar – quartz ± 

plagioclase and often display patchy and nebulitic morphologies. Melanosomes, represented by CG-

3A1, CG-3A4 and CGG-FMC10, consist of cordierite – k-feldspar – plagioclase – quartz - spinel – 

ilmenite ± garnet ± biotite (Fig 4 (c-3)). The mesocratic neosome contains the same assemblage with a 

higher volume of felsic minerals. Melanosomes locally display schollen (Fig 4 (c-1)) and schlieren 

morphologies (Fig 4 (c-2)). Inferred cordierite pseudomorphs after garnet occur locally in the 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

95 

leucosomes (Fig. 4 (c-4)), where relict garnet is commonly present within cordierite crystals. 

6.6 - Petrography, mineral chemistry and whole-rock chemistry 

Whole-rock chemistry is presented in appendix B.1 and mineral chemistry in Table 3. The 

samples chosen that have good potential for metamorphic modeling (BGCM-101, BGOM-7A1B and 

CG-3A1) share some textures and microstructures despite having different preserved mineral 

assemblages. All samples show textural evidence consistent with the occurrence of partial melting with 

production and loss of melt to varying degrees, namely (Vernon 2011, Sawyer 2008): (1) the presence 

of small felsic patches, films and veinlets of former melt (“pools of melt” or “protoleucosomes”), now 

pseudomorphs of quartz, K-feldpar or sodic plagioclase; (2) the pools are developed where the grains of 

the reactant assemblage touch and are commonly rimmed by grains with euhedral outlines that may be 

feldspar or peritectic minerals; (3) quartz, K-feldspar or sodic plagioclase often have cuspate rims; (4) 

the presence of patches and layers rich in peritectic minerals; and (5) reactant minerals have corroded 

and embayed shapes.  

 Biotite – garnet ± cordierite metagreywacke (BGCM-101 and BGM-114) 

BGCM-101 (Fig. 5(a-e)) consists of biotite + garnet + cordierite + sillimanite + plagioclase + 

K-feldspar + ilmenite + quartz, with zircon, monazite and apatite as accessory phases. BGM-114 

consists of biotite + garnet + sillimanite + plagioclase + K-feldspar + ilmenite + quartz with zircon, 

monazite and apatite as accessory phases. The hereafter presented mineral chemistry and detailed 

petrography description are based on BGCM-101, but BGM-114 has very similar characteristics. 

Subhedral garnet poikiloblasts range in size from 2 to 7 mm in diameter. They contain lobate or rounded 

inclusions of quartz and biotite, rounded or subhedral and locally myrmekitic inclusions of plagioclase, 

and elongate to acicular sillimanite inclusions (Fig. 5 (b)). Garnet is set in a medium to fine-grained 

matrix composed of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, cordierite and biotite that typically defines the 

foliation. Locally, fine-grained subhedral biotite occurs at the rims of garnet (Fig. 5 (c)). Garnet crystals 

are fairly homogeneous in composition, yielding XAlm (Fe
2+/(Fe2+ + Mg + Ca + Mn))= 0.67, XGros 

(Ca/(Fe2+  + Mg + Ca + Mn))= 0.02, XSpss (Mn/(Fe
2+ + Mg + Ca + Mn))= 0.02 and Mg# (100 ×Mg/(Mg 

+ Fe2+))= 29. Locally, garnet rims less than 150 ?m thick with no difference in texture from cores have 

compositions of XAlm = 0.69-0.73, XGros =0.03, XSpss =0.02 and Mg# = 28. Because of these textural 

relationships and the anatectic features of outcrop 10, garnet is considered to have originated from fluid-

absent biotite melting reactions and to be peritectic in origin. Cordierite is commonly associated with 

garnet, rimming garnet grains and in instances it appears to be a garnet pseudomorph (Fig. 5 (d)). 

Anhedral, 1-10 mm, pinitised poikiloblastic cordierite crystals have Mg# within the range of 67 to 70. 

K-feldspar occurs as 2-6 mm subhedral to anhedral crystals that may show embayed shapes and cuspate

areas when surrounded by plagioclase, quartz and biotite. They commonly contain included fine-grained 

euhedral biotite (Fig. 5 (e)). Plagioclase is anhedral to subhedral and 1-2 mm in size.  

 Biotite – garnet – orthopyroxene metagreywacke (BGOM-7A1B) 

BGOM-7A1B consists of garnet + orthopyroxene + biotite + plagioclase + K-feldspar + ilmenite 

+ quartz + pyrite, with zircon, apatite and monazite as accessories. Poikiloblastic garnet and medium-

grained orthopyroxene are set in a fine to medium-grained granoblastic matrix of quartz, K-feldspar, 

plagioclase and biotite that defines the foliation (Fig. 5 (f-k)). Garnet poikiloblasts (1-10 mm in diamter) 

contain inclusions of lobate and rounded quartz, plagioclase and biotite. Garnet compositions are 

homogeneous and garnet is unzoned with XAlm = 0.64-0.65, XGros =0.04, XSpss = 0.03 and Mg# = 31. 

Some compositions measured within very thin rims (&lt;150 ?m) vary slightly in composition (e.g. from 

XAlm=0.64 in cores to 0.65 in rims), althought there is no textural difference from cores to rims. 

Composite Grt + Opx aggregates are common (Fig. 5 (f)). Orthopyroxene crystals are fine to medium-

grained and are always in contact with either biotite or garnet. Matrix orthopyroxene (XFeOpx= 0.48-0.49 

and Mg#= 50-51) is coarse-grained and contains inclusions of both rounded biotite (biotite Mg#= 57-

58; Fig. 5 (g, h)) and fine-grained subhedral (&lt;200 ?m) biotite (Fig. 5 (i)). Locally, orthopyroxene 

associated with garnet has compositions of XFeOpx= 0.45 and Mg#= 54. This specific compositional 

difference between matrix Opx and Opx in contact with garnet may signify that the former may have 

engaged in Fe-Mg diffusion to produce late biotite. These features and field relationships suggest that 

both the garnet and orthopyroxene are peritectic phases that formed from fluid-absent melting of biotite. 

Anhedral 0.4-1.0 mm plagioclase grains (XAb=0.53-0.60, XAn=0.37-0.44 and XSan=0.01-0.02) are 

common in the granoblastic matrix, and are locally replaced by sericite. Strings of sub- to euhedral Qtz 

+ Pl rim Grt crystals (Fig. 5 (j)). K-feldspar is observed either as anhedral crystals in the granoblastic 

matrix, or as cuspate and lobate crystals riming orthopyroxene, garnet (Fig. 6 (k)), feldspar and quartz. 

Anhedral biotite crystals in the matrix that do not touch either garnet or orthopyroxene and have Mg# = 

53-54 whereas rounded biotite inclusions in garnet have Mg#= 58-59.  

Sample 7C, from the same locality (outcrop 7), bears the same assemblage as BGOM-7A1B, 

except for the presence of cordierite (2% in volume) and absence of orthopyroxene. Garnet has abundant 

inclusions of sillimanite, rounded biotite, quartz and plagioclase. Anhedral cordierite rims garnet and 

biotite and less commonly has rounded biotite inclusions. Locally, cordierite is subhedral.  

 Cordierite ± garnet granulite (CG-3A1, CG3A4 and CGG-FMC10) 

CG-3A1 is a biotie-poor and garnet-absent lithotype that consists of cordierite + K-feldspar + 

plagioclase + sillimanite + spinel + ilmenite + biotite + quartz, with zircon, monazite and apatite in trace

97 

amounts. Minor retrograde white mica and carbonate are observed. Cordierite poikiloblasts and K-

feldspar porphyroblasts are set in a granoblastic matrix composed of fine-grained cordierite, K-feldspar, 

plagioclase, spinel, ilmenite, and minor biotite (Fig. 5 (i)). Anhedral, 0.3-10 mm cordierite crystals 

contain biotite, quartz and spinel inclusions and are commonly pinitized (Fig. 5 (m, n)). Subhedral ~1 

mm cordierite crystals (XFeCrd= 0.23-0.24 and Mg#= 76-77) are rimmed by feldspar with cuspate shapes 

(Fig. 5 (l)). K-feldspar occurs as 0.5-5mm porphyroblasts, smaller crystals in the matrix, and anhedral 

cuspate-shaped crystals embaying spinel, quartz and plagioclase. They are commonly perthitic and show 

simple twinning. Quartz, plagioclase, biotite, zircon and monazite inclusions occur in K-feldspar 

poikiloblasts. Anhedral 0.5-2.0 mm diameter plagioclase grains are commonly antiperthitic. Biotite 

occurs as inclusions in cordierite and K-feldspar, or as corroded crystals in the matrix (Fig. 5 (p)). Spinel 

consists mainly of magnetite and hercynite. Magnetite is ubiquitous in the matrix, as well as commonly 

associated with ilmenite and hercynite. Locally, imagnetite growth appears to have occurred at the 

expense of biotite remnant crystals. Hercynite is always associated with crystals of magnetite ± ilmenite 

within cordierite crystals (Fig. 5 (m)). 

CG-3A4 is richer in biotite than CG-3A1 (Fig. 5 (q)) and consists of cordierite + K-feldspar + 

plagioclase + sillimanite + spinel + ilmenite + biotite.  Additionally, zircon, monazite and apatite are 

present at trace abundances. CG-3A4 contains elongate, poikiloblastic coarse-grained cordierite 

aggregates (XFeCrd = 0.24-0.26 and Mg# = 73-75) bearing inclusions of hercynite and sillimanite (Fig. 5 

(r)). Fine grained cordierite is less commonly observed in the matrix, where it is more pinitized than 

cordierite in elongate aggregates. These aggregates, in addition to relict biotite, define the foliation. 

Plagioclase + quartz + matrix cordierite (XFeCrd = 0.26 and Mg# = 73) locally form a mosaic rimming 

elongated cordierite aggregates (Fig. 5 (s)).  

CGG-FMC10 is a garnet-bearing lithotype that consists of cordierite + garnet + K-feldspar + 

plagioclase + sillimanite + spinel + ilmenite + biotite. Garnet poikiloblasts with silimanite inclusions 

(Fig. 5 (r)) are rimmed (Fig. 5 (r)), or wrapped, by hercynitic spinel (Fig. 5 (s)). Cordierite occurs as 

coarse-grained poikiloblasts that include biotite and silimanite (Fig. 5 (t, u)). Garnet is either rimmed by 

cordierite (Fig. 6 (r)) or corroded garnet touches cordierite crystals (Fig. 5 (u)). Corroded and subhedral 

biotite is rimmed by bright segregations that probably consist of feldspar (Fig. 5 (v)). Euhedral cordierite 

is observed in sites where K-feldspar form apparent “pools” rimming other feldspar and quartz with 

cuspate and lobate shapes (Fig. 5 (w)).  

The combination of supramentioned features of samples CG-3A1, CG-3A4 and CGG-FMC-10 

and the anatectic aspects of outcrop 3 and FMC10 suggest that garnet and most cordierite are peritectic 

in origin, having formed from fluid-absent melting reactions mainly via the breakdown of biotite. 

However, some features in these samples suggest that they may have been affected by a second

metamorphic event, such as: newly formed euhedral to subhedral cordierite (Fig. 5 (l, v)) and the 

presence of anhedral to subhedral hercynite always associated with crystals of magnetite ± ilmenite 

within cordierite crystals (Fig. 5 (m)).

6.7 - P-T conditions of equilibria  

 Assessing metamorphic conditions of inferred peak and preserved assemblages  

Outcrop-scale observations show abundant leucosome oriented parallel to, as well as 

overprinting structural fabrics that contain variable amounts of peritectic garnet, cordierite and 

orthopyroxene (Fig. 4). Microstructures provide evidence of the former presence of melt and for the 

formation of peritectic minerals, as shown in Figure 5. It is inferred that, over time, leucosomes acted 

either as sites of melt accumulation and melt drainage that allowed effective melt loss from the system. 

As H2O strongly partitions into the melt, melt segregation and escape is required for the preservation of 

largely unretrogressed high-grade assemblages (e.g. White &amp;amp; Powell, 2002). In this study, it is assumed 

that the preservation of high-grade assemblages must have followed melt loss at, or close to, peak P-T 

conditions (e.g. White &amp;amp; Powell 2002; Taylor et al. 2014; Nicoli et al. 2014). Modeling of all samples 

show the solidus just below the peak P-T assemblages, which is consistent with the preservation of these

101 

assemblages (White &amp;amp; Powell, 2002). Thus modeling allows metamorphic equilibria to be constrained 

from the moment rocks have lost melt. However, because samples have undergone melt loss and hence 

bulk compositional modification, their prograde evolution cannot be constrained using melt-depleted 

bulk-rock compositions (White &amp;amp; Powell, 2002). Therefore, this study focuses on the peak to retrograde 

evolution of the modeled samples.  

Because the determination of FeO, Fe2O3 and H2O contents in bulk-rock compositions play a 

major role in determining phase relations in pseudosections calculations, a number of T-MFe and T-

MH2O were constructed for each of the samples in a variety of pressure conditions so the values were 

consistent with the assumed peak-metamorphic mineral assemblages observed in each of them. H2O 

contents were set to values consistent with: (1) the formation of the infered peak-metamorphic 

assemblages based on the assumption of partial melting driven by biotite-breakdown reactions; (2) the 

modal abundance of melt between 0 and 10% at peak metamorphic conditions (Nicoli et al. 2014); (3) 

the absence of phases at peak which occur only as decompression related textures (e.g., cordierite); (4) 

the presence of phases at peak that likely have been replaced during decompression considering related 

textures (e.g., garnet). The bulk-Fe2O3 content was chosen to values consistent with the formation of the 

observed mineral assemblages in determined P-T conditions according with the mineral modes and Fe3+ 

contents in garnet and ilmenite. Bulk-rock compositions used for modeling were obtained from those 

calculations and normalized to 100% (Table 4). Within stability fields, compositional isopleths and 

isomodes of volume % of solids were plotted with the aim to better contrain P-T conditions within peak 

and preserved assemblage fields. These isopleths were compared to mineral chemistry and isomodes 

with visually estimated mineral modes.

with the modeling (see text) and normalized to 100%.

 Biotite-garnet-cordierite metagreywacke (BGCM-101) 

Figure 6 shows pseudosections calculated for BGCM-101. The P-T pseudosection in Figure 6 

(a) shows the P-T fields of peak assemblage Bt – Grt – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Liq – Qtz and the preserved 

assemblage Bt – Grt – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Qtz. Figure 5(b) shows compositional isopleths of XAlm and 

volume % of Grt. Measured mineral composition of Grt yield XAlm values ranging from 67 (cores) to 73 

(&gt;150 ?m thin rims) and estimated grt volume of 6-8% delineate two highlighted zones that overlap in 

the peak field and in the suprasolidus lower-pressure field Bt – Grt – Crd – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Liq – Qtz.

Figure 6 (c) shows compositional Crd Mg# isopleths and volume % of Crd. The two highlighted zones 

are delineated by measured compositions yielding Crd Mg# that range from 67-70 and cordierite vol% 

of 2-3. These zones overlap in the Crd-in transition from the peak field to the lower-pressure 

suprasolidus field and in the preserved assemblage lower-temperature field. Figure 6 (d) shows melt vol 

% isomodes. The delineated melt vol % zone assumes that no more than 5% was produced at peak. This 

same procedure was used for the other modelled samples.  

P-T path and P-T conditions of stable assemblages 

The clockwise P-T path depicted in Figure 6 (e) was constructed by overlapping all the 

highlighted zones of Figure 6 (b-d). The peak metamorphic assemblage Bt – Grt – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm 

– Liq – Qtz is stable between 755 to 815°C and 5900 to &gt;9000 Bar. The path starts in the narrow T 

(~760-780°C) zone delineated by overlapping zones of Bt Mg# (59-61), Grt vol % (7), Grt XAlm (0.67) 

and melt vol % (=2-3). Peak conditions are followed by nearly isothermal decompression until the path 

crosses the Crd-in line and reaches P-T conditions where the assemblage Bt – Grt – Crd – Sil – Pl – Kfs 

– Ilm – Liq – Qtz is stable. The path crosses part of this field where melt vol % decreases (from 3 to 0), 

Grt XAlm increases (from 0.71-0.73), Grt vol % decreases (from 7 to 5), Crd vol% increases (from 0 to 

3) and Crd Mg# decreases (from 70 to 67). This is followed by cooling where the path crosses the solidus 

(at 765° C and 5800 Bar) and reaches the field where the preserved assemblage Bt – Grt – Sil – Pl – Kfs 

– Ilm – Qtz is stable. Within this field, P-T conditions are further restricted by overlapping zones 

determined by XAlm (thin 150 ?m rims = 0.73), Crd Mg# (67-70) and Crd vol% (~2-3). The restricted 

field within the preserved assemblage field is stable in P-T conditions of 720 to 766°C and 5100 to 5900 

Bar. This clockwise P-T path is consistent with the petrography of the rock and measured mineral 

chemistry, particularly with cordierite rimming and pseudomorphing garnet (Fig. 6 (d)) and with the 

preservation of the high-grade assemblage with minor evidence of retrogression.  

 Biotite-garnet-orthopyroxene metagreywacke (BGOM-7A1B) 

Figure 7 shows pseudosection calculated for BGOM-7A1B. Figure 7 (a) shows P-T conditions 

where the peak assemblage Bt – Grt – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Liq – Qtz and the preserved assemblage 

Bt – Grt – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Qtz are stable. This Figure displays a P-T path constructed by 

overlapping highlighted zones in Figures 7 (b-d). Figure 7 (b) shows plots of Grt XAlm, Grt XGros isopleths 

and isomodes of Grt vol %. Measured Grt compositions yield XAlm and XGros values that range from 0.63 

to 0.65 and 0.04 to 0.05, respectively. Grt volume in the rock is estimated between 4 to 5 %. The 

highlighted zones were delineated within these ranges of values and intersect in the subsolidus 

assemblage fields Bt – Grt – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Qtz and Bt – Grt – Crd – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – 

Qtz. Figure 7 (c) shows compositional isopleths of Opx Mg# and and isomodes of Opx vol%, as well as

103 

zones delineated by the measured compositional range of Opx Mg# (50-54) and estimated Opx vol % 

(3-4). These fields intersect in the peak assemblage field and in the two above-mentioned subsolidus 

fields. Figure 7 (d) shows melt vol % isomodes from 0 to 5%. 

P-T path and P-T conditions of stable assemblages 

Figure 7 (e) depicts a P-T path constructed with the use of overlapped zones in Figures 7 (b-d). 

The peak assemblage Bt – Grt – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Liq – Qtz is stable within a narrow field from 

810 to 852°C and 5300 to &gt;9000 Bar. The clockwise P-T path starts at peak and is followed by 

decompression and subsequent cooling after the solidus is crossed (at 810°C and 5300 Bar). A suggested 

restricted field of stability of the preserved assemblage Bt – Grt – Opx – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Qtz ranging 

from 630 to 800°C and 4300 to 5200 bars was constructed by overlapping zones of Grt XAlm (0.63-0.65), 

Grt XGros (0.04-0.05), Grt vol % (4-5), Opx Mg# (50-54) and Opx vol% (3-4). After the P-T path crosses 

the solidus and reaches this restricted field, values of Grt Xalm increases from 0.63 to 0.65, Grt XGros 

decreases from 0.05 to&amp;lt;0.05, Grt vol% remain inbetween 5 to 4, Opx Mg# decreases from 54 to 52 and 

Opx vol% slightly decreases from ~4 to &gt;4. This decompression and subsequent cooling is consistent 

with measured compositions in most small garnets and in a few garnet rims of XAlm=0.64, as well as in 

matrix orthopyroxene (Mg#=50) containing fine-grained biotite inclusions (Fig. 7 (i)). This is also 

reflects the slightly decrease in Opx vol % whereas Grt vol% remains roughly the same.  

The subsolidus restricted field encompasses part of a lower-pressure Crd-present assemblage 

(Crd-in line shown as a dashed line within this field), although Crd was not observed as part of the 

preserved assemblage. In the lower-pressure section of this field, plots of Crd vol % yield less than 1 

vol% Crd. It is possible that: (1) such values are so small that may not be represented in thin sections or 

visible in outcrop-scale; or (2) the dashed Crd-in line in fact represents a low-pressure limit for the 

stability of the preserved assemblage restricted field. Consistent with this, other samples from the same 

outcrop (e.g. sample 7C) do contain a few cordierite crystals, which do not reach 1 % vol of the rock. 

Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that the low-pressure limit for the stability of the preserved 

assemblage would be from the cordierite-in line until the 1% vol cordierite isomode. In any case, the P-

T obtained from modeling is consistent with observed microstructures and with the preservation of the 

high-grade assemblage with minor evidence of retrogression.

 Cordierite granulite (CG-3A1) 

In Figure 8, pseudosections calculated for CG-3A1 show the peak assemblage Grt – Crd – Sil – 

Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Mag – Liq – Qtz and the preserved assemblage Bt – Crd – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Mag 

– Qtz in (a). The P-T path between these assemblages is depicted in Figure 8 (a) and was constructed by 

overlapping the highlighted zones in Figures 8 (b-d). Figure 8 (b) shows plots of Crd Mg# and Crd vol% 

isomodes. The measured values of Crd Mg# and estimated Crd vol% delineate two highlighted zones. 

Figure 8 (c) shows plots of Bt Mg#, Bt vol% and Grt vol%. Although CG-3A1 is a Grt-absent 

metagreywacke, Grt vol% isomodes were plotted because: (1) CGG-FMC10, collected from the same 

location, is a Grt-bearing metagreywacke; (2) there is textural evidence in CG-3A1, CG-3A4 and CGG-

FMC10 that garnet has been replaced by cordierite and spinel (Fig. 8). In fact, the pseudosection shows 

that Grt is only stable in suprasolidus fields above ~6000 bar. The measured values of fine-grained 

biotite Mg# range from 65-68 and the estimated modes of 0-3 vol% are consistent with the small amount 

of Bt observed in thin sections from CG-3A1. Figure 8 (d) shows plots of melt vol % isomodes and Pl 

Xan isopleths. Values of melt% from 0 to 5 and Pl XAn from 0.28 to 0.33 delineate two highlighted zones.  

P-T path and P-T conditions of stable assemblages 

The clockwise P-T path depicted in Figure 8 (e) was constructed by overlapping zones of Figures 

8 (b-d). The peak assemblage Grt – Crd – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Mag – Liq – Qtz is stable between 775 

to &gt;1000°C and 6250 to 7500 Bar. The path starts at peak, which is followed by decompression where 

the path crosses the Grt-out line.  Microstuctures corroborate this, particularly in CGG FMC10, where 

garnet is rimmed and wrapped by spinel (e.g., Fig 5 (r, s)) and cordierite locally appears as a garnet 

pseudomorph (e.g. Fig 5 (l)) and touching corroded garnet (e.g., fig 5 (u)). This is also consistent with 

Crd vol% increase until approximately 16 % in the field Crd – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Mag – Liq – Qtz. 

The path continues with substantial cooling where it crosses the solidus (at ~780°C and 5500 Bar), the 

Crd – Sil – Pl – Kfs – Ilm – Mag – Qtz field and reaches the preserved assemblage Bt – Crd – Sil – Pl – 

Kfs – Ilm – Mag – Qtz. The small field that further restricts P-T conditions of equilibria of the preserved 

assemblage is delineated by a dashed line and represents the overlapping of Crd Mg# and Bt Mg# 

isopleths. It is stable in P-T conditions of 650 to 720°C and 4250 to 5555 Bar. This restricted field almost 

reaches measured values of Pl XAn=0.34. Interestingly, it underestimates the volume of cordierite 

observed in the rock (12-15%) to 7% whereas it overestimates the amount of Bt (0-3%) to 4%.

The modal abundance of cordierite and the presence of hercynite in CG-3A1, CG-3A4 and 

CGG-FCM10 are not completely explained by metamorphic modeling but can be assessed from 

metamorphic microstructures and field relations. The fact those samples were collected from outcrops 

that are less than 4 km distant from the wide Pedra do Elefante G5 Batholith suggests that the peak-

metamorphic mineral assemblages have been modified by a lower pressure overprint associated with 

emplacement of this pluton. This has been observed in other orogenic segments worldwide, e.g. the 

Ivrea Zone, Italy (Barboza &amp;amp; Bergantz 2000). The overprint consists mainly in late generation of 

cordierite and hercinitic spinel. The generation of more cordierite post-peak may justify the 

underestimation of cordierite modes obtained by metamorphic modeling. Moreover, the presence of 

fine-grained euhedral to subhedral cordierite crystals (Figs. 5 (m, w) that are commonly within melt 

pseudomorphs may indicate that part of cordierite is a cotectic phase (e.g. Grant 2004) formed during 

melt crystallization.  

Altought the modeling does not constrain the evolution of sample 3A1 in response to the nearby 

intrusion, the use of it in combination with microstructures from samples 3A1, 3A4 and FMC10 shows 

that the simplified P-T path is consistent with both the microstutcures and the evolution of other samples 

in the NVC during peak regional metamorphism.   

6.8 - Zircon and monazite U-Pb geochronology 

U-Pb zircon and monazite ages obtained in our study are presented in Figure 9 and summarized 

in Tables 5 and 6. Suplementary figures can be found in Appendices C.1 and C.2. 

 Peraluminous granodiorite (PG-7D) 

PG-7D contains zircons that vary in size from 50-100 µm (width) to 50-400 µm (length) and 

have a variable morphology (Fig. 9 (k)). Analysis in 50 spots yield a range of concordant to sub-

concordant ages that spread along the Concordia diagram from ca. 631 to 475 Ma (Fig. 9 (a)) and record 

a complex history. The unmix ages routine of Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) yields at least 5 populations 

with ages (±2?) of 626.0 ± 9 (6%), 594.4 ± 7.8 (14%), 570.6 ± 3 (41%), 508.8 ± 5 (26%) and 483.2 ± 7 

(13%) Ma (appendix C.2(a)). The ages of these populations are consistent with the following described 

mean ages, Concordia ages and morphologies from this sample and from other samples in this study. 

CL-defined cores with bright luminescence truncated by darker overgrowths define the oldest 

population (n=3) with a mean age of 626.1 ± 8 Ma (MSWD=0.44; appendix C.2(a)). Six spots in 

elongate, prismatic, euhedral to subhedral magmatic zircons with oscillatory zoning (OZ) or faded OZ 

(that may or may not be truncaded by thin mostly 10 µm rims) yield a Concordia age of 593 ± 8 Ma 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

109 

(MSDW=2.1, Fig.9 (a)) and Th/U= 0.14-0.46. This age is interpreted to record the magmatic 

crystallization of the intrusive PG-7D prior to peak regional deformation and metamorphism. The 

remaining 39 spot analysis was obtained from zircon metamorphic overgrowths (30-70 µm) that have 

Th/U= 0.04-0.26, are mostly bright luminescent and truncate CL-defined cores with OZ or faded OZ. 

Twenty-one zircon spots yield a mean age of 571 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=1.4; Fig. 9 (a)). Four spots yield a 

concordia age of 523.2 ± 9.4 Ma (MSDW=2.1; appendix C.2(a)), which is very similar to the magmatic 

age of the granite sample 7B (Fig 9 (c); see next). Ten spots yield a mean age of 501.9 ± 4 Ma 

(MSDW=0.84; appendix C.2(a)). The remaining four spots have a mean age of 483 ± 6 Ma 

(MSWD=0.99; appendix C.2).   

Monazites are 1:2 and 1:1 (100-300 µm in lenght) subhedral to subrounded unzoned grains with 

very little number of preserved cores, whose spots compose three very distinct age populations (Fig. 9 

(b)). The oldest one (n=3) have ages from ca. 663 to 620 Ma that are interpreted as inherited. Twenty-

eight spots have mean ages of 566.5 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=0.86). The youngest population (n=20) have mean 

ages of 513.0 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=0.1). 

 Granite (G-7B) 

G-7B contains zircons varying in size from 1:2 and 3:5 (50-250 µm in length). Analysis in 81 

spots yield a range of concordant to sub-concordant ages that spread along the Concordia diagram from 

&gt;680 to ca. 486 Ma (Fig. 9 (c)). The Unmix ages routine of Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) yields 3 younger 

populations (&lt;600 Ma) with ages (±2?) of 558.7 ± 5 (17%), 519.9 ± 2 (66%) and 495.7 ± 5 (16%) Ma 

(appendix C.2(b)), which are consistent with the following described mean ages, Concordia ages and 

morphologies from this sample and from other samples in this study (Table 6). CL-defined rounded, 

mostly dark, 10-80 µm cores, have apparent ages ranging from ca. 2609 to 588 Ma. Analysis in 30 

euhedral to subhedral prismatic and/or elongated crystals with faded OZ, that in a few cases overgrow 

cores, yield a mean age of 519.3 ± 2 Ma (MSWD=1.1; Fig. 10(c)) and have Th/U=0.01-0.39. This age 

is interpreted to record the magmatic crystallization of G-7B, which is undeformed and sharply intrusive 

in outcrop 7. The zircon cores (inherited and magmatic) are truncated by well defined 20-50 µm rims 

that are mostly bright luminescent (Fig. 9 (k)). Analysis in eleven of these rims show one significant 

youngest population with a Concordia age of 497. 7 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=1.6; Fig. 9 (c)) and Th/U=0.02-

0.20. The meaning of the population at ca. 560 (Fig 9 (c)) in this sample is uncertain, but may record 

the metamorphic event ranging from 571 to 560 Ma (next subsections) imprinted in all metasedimentary 

samples and in sample 7D.  

Monazites from G-7B are 1:2 and 1:1 (100-300 µm in lenght) subhedral to subrounded unzoned 

crystals. Figure 9 (d) shows that analysis yield an age range from 548 to 488 Ma along the Concordia 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

110 

line. A mean age of 506.8 ± 5 Ma (MSWD=2.2) was calculated using the 37 spot analysis within this 

range. The Unmix ages routine of Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003)  yields three main populations with ages 

and 2? uncertainties at 542 ± 25 Ma (4%), 519.8 ± 19 Ma (22%) and 501.7 ± 6 Ma (74%). The age of 

the two youngest populations (representing 96% of the analysis) are consistent with the supramentioned 

zircon magmatic ages (519.3 ± 2 Ma) and the zircon youngest metamorphic population (497. 7 ± 4 Ma) 

in this sample.  

 Biotite-garnet-orthopyroxene metagreywacke (BGOM-7A1B) 

Zircons from high-grade BGOM-7A1B have a variable morphology, ranging from 1:4 and 3:5 

(100-250 µm in lenght) subhedral, elongated to 1:1 (50 µm in length) sub-rounded crystals, which 

correlate with age groupings. The analysis yield a complex age set that ranges almost continuously from 

ca. 660 to 530 Ma (Fig. 9 (e)) along the corcondia line. CL-defined detrital cores are 2:5 and 1:5 (50-

100 µm in length) domains that mostly present ghost OZ. Twenty-five spot ages in cores reveal an 

apparent span from ca. 873 to 600 Ma. The Unmix ages rotine of Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) indicate 

there are 4 main populations of detrital zircons within this range, with ages (±2?) of 877.3 ± 14 Ma 

(8%); 822.8 ± 11 Ma (12%); 649.2 ± 6 Ma (20%); and 609.7 ± 3 Ma (60%; appendix C.2(c)). These 

peak ages are clear in the probability density diagram constructed using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) in 

Fig. 10(e). The youngest spots (n=12) among detrital zircons yield a concordia age of 606.1 ± 3.4 Ma 

(MSWD=0.91; appendix C.2), interpreted to represent the maximum sedimentation age of sample 

7A1B. The CL-defined cores are truncated by both dark and bright luminescent rims that overgrow cores 

and/or present a transgressive recrystallization over cores. Analysis in rim domains indicate distinct 

metamorphic populations. The Unmix ages rotine of Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) indicate there are 2 (out 

of 4, appendix C.2) more important populations of metamorphic zircons within this range at: 587.8 ± 4 

Ma (46%) and 568.4 ± 4 (42%). The oldest population (n=13) have a mean age of 589.6 ± 3 Ma 

(MSWD=0.86; Th/U=0.09-0.28; Fig. 9 (e)), interpreted to record the intrusion and magmatic 

crystallization of early granitoids, such as PG-7D (593 ± 8 Ma), prior to peak 

deformation/metamorphism. A metamorphic population obtained from 16 zircon spots have a Concordia 

age of 570 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=1.6; Th/U= 0.03-0.29; Fig. 9 (e)) is interpreted to represent the regional 

peak metamorphism, which is also recorded in PG-7D (571 ± 4 Ma).  

Monazite grains are subhedral and subrounded 1:1 100-200 µm (in length) grains that are 

unzoned in BSE images. A monazite concordia diagram is presented in Figs. 9 (f), from 64 analysed 

monazite spots. Fifty-six of the youngest zircon spots yield a mean age of 495.0 ± 3 Ma (MSWD=1.08).  

 Biotite-garnet-cordierite metagreywacke (BGCM-101) 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

111 

Zircons from BGCM-101 have variable morphologies, including 1:1 and 2:5 (50-250 in length) 

elongate, subhedral, subrounded and oval crystals. Ubiquotous CL-defined zircon cores, truncated by 

overgrowths and transgressive recrystallization of rims, are mostly dark 25-100 µm (in length) oval to 

sub-rounded shaped domains. Sixty-seven analysis in these cores reveal an apparent range of spot ages 

from ca. 2097 to 597 Ma. Using the Unmix ages routine (Isoplot/Ex; Ludwig 2003), six main 

populations are determined among detrital zircons (ages ± 2?): 903.4 ± 7 Ma (13%); 807.8 ± 19 Ma 

(2%); 781.1 ± 18 (2%); 698.2 ± 7 Ma (21%); 652.5 ± 6 Ma (24%); and 612.3 ± 3 Ma (38%; appendix 

C.2(d)). These populations are crearly shown in the probability density diagram of Figure 11(c). A 

concordia age of the youngest population (n=19) is 607.3 ± 4 Ma (MSWD=1.80), interpreted to be the 

maximum sedimentation age of sample 101. The zircon rims are 20-50 µm bright domais that overgrow 

cores, with Th/U=0.03-0.21. Analysis (n=5) yield a metamorphic Concordia age of 560.8 ± 5 Ma 

(MSWD=1.16; Fig 9 (g)), interpreted to represent the peak regional metamorphism.  

Monazites are mostly unzoned rounded 1:1 100-200 µm (in length) crystals. Three analysis have 

ages around 608 Ma, interpreted to be detrital. Two very distinct age populations have were obtained: 

the oldest (n=16) with a mean age of 557.4 ± 5 Ma (MSWD=0.67) and the youngest (n=18) with a mean 

age of 498.6 ± 4 Ma (MSDW=0.94).  

 Cordierite granulite (CG-3A1) 

Zircons from metasedimentary sample 3A1 are oval to sub-rounded 1:1 and 1:2 (50-200 in 

length) crystals. Ubiquotous CL-defined cores are both dark and bright luminescent 50 µm domains that 

often present ghost OZ. Analysis in these cores yield an apparent range of spot ages spanning from ca. 

1942 to 588 Ma. Using the Unmix ages routine (Isoplot/Ex; Ludwig 2003), six main detrital populations 

are determined within the most important range from ca. 806 to 588 Ma (ages ± 2?): 789.5 ± 7 Ma (8%); 

746.4 ± 6 Ma (15%); 715.4 ± 9 Ma (7%); 649.1 ± 4 Ma (34%); and 612.8 ± 3 Ma (36%). These peak 

ages are clear in the probability density diagram constructed using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) in Fig. 10 

(d). The youngest group (n=10) yield a Concordia age of 607.4 ± 5.7 Ma (MSWD=2.2; Fig 9 (g)), 

interpreted to represent the maximum sedimentation age of sample 3A1. Rims are 10-50 µm both dark 

and bright domains that truncate and recrystallize transgressively over cores. Analysis in seven of these 

domains yield a mean age of 564.6 ± 5 Ma (MSWD=1.18), interpreted to represent the peak regional

 Biotite-garnet metagreywacke (BGM-114) 

In-situ monazite dating was undertaken in BGM-114. BSE images show that monazite crystals 

are unzoned, range from 20 to 120 µm in size and are included or rimming biotite, garnet and feldspar.

6.9 - Discussion and concluding remarks 

 Magmatism in the Araçuaí Orogen 

In the diagram shown in Fig. 10(a), sets of 71 reported zircon concordia ages from G1 to G5 

Supersuites have a broad age overlap, which can be interpreted as a nearly continuous supply of magma 

from at least 640 to 480 Ma. Major peaks in zircon crystallization are grouped into six periods: 640-595 

Ma (G1 event); 595-570 Ma (G2+G1 events); 570-540 Ma (G2); 540-525 Ma (G3+G4); 525-505 Ma 

(G4+G5); and 505-475 Ma (G5). Relative probability density (RPD) diagrams constructed using 

compiled G1-G5 ages (Fig. 10(b)) corroborate these overlaps and further suggest two main magmatic 

pulses: one that comprise the most voluminous G1 and G2 Supersuites, both with a peak at ca. 575 Ma; 

and the late event comprising the G5 Supersuite.  

 Nature and provenance of the Nova Venécia Complex 

The seven populations that compose the NVC detrital zircon dataset (Table 5) are correlated 

with the main peaks in detrital ages depicted in Figure 10(c-e). Populations 1 (ca. 609-612 Ma) and 2 

(ca. 649-652 Ma), which are the main detrital populations in all of our samples, clearly overlap with the 

early AO magmatism (Fig. 10(a-b)). This indicates the Rio Doce arc (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011) 

as the main provenance of NVC protoliths, from ca. 650 to 610 Ma, as illustrated in Figure 12. These 

findings aggree with previous suggestions that the NVC represents a back-arc basin related to the Rio 

Doce magmatic arc, including the Serra da Bolivia Complex (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011; Heilbron et 

al. 2013; Novo, 2013, Noce et al. 2004, Gradim et al. 2014) and part of the G1 Supersuite. However, 

the geochronology in this study suggests that only the early G1 plutonism (and contemporaneous rocks 

with ages around 620 Ma; Fig.10(a-b)) may truly represent the pre-collisional plutonic portion of the 

Rio Doce arc and, therefore, a possible source for the NVC basin. Other possible sources during this 

same period (650-610 Ma) could have been related to the southern Rio Negro arc (RFB, e.g. Heilbron 

&amp;amp; Machado 2003). Older populations 3 (ca. 715-698 Ma), 5 (ca. 789-781 Ma) and 7 (ca. 903-877 Ma; 

Table 5) may correlate to reported ages of the rift-related Southern Bahia alkaline province (732-696 

Ma, Rosa et al. 2007), the early portion of the Rio Negro magmatic arc in the RFB (ca. 790 Ma, 

Tupinambá et al. 2012) and the rift-related Salto da Divisa Suite (ca. 880 Ma, Silva et al. 2008). 

Provenance of populations 4 (ca. 746 Ma) and 6 (ca. 807-822 Ma) is uncertain.  

The maximum sedimentation age of the NVC is 606 Ma, calculated based on the youngest 

population that compose the detrital zircon dataset of each sample (Table 5). The NVC sedimentation 

can be bracketed between its maximum depositional age at ca. 606 Ma and the intrusion of granitoids at 

593 Ma (PG-7D, Fig. 9(a)). This indicates the NVC was deposited within at least a 13 Ma period, during

115 

a transition from convergent (G1) to syn-collisional (G2) plutonism, as shown in Figs. 10(b) and 12. 

Our interpretation is that the NVC protoliths were (meta)greywackes (enriched with more or less 15 to 

50% clay and silt components), possibly formed as turbidites (high energy density flows) from the Rio 

Doce magmatic arc. A possible mechanism that may have accounted for the effective erosion of the 

early Rio Doce arc may relate to the global-scale Marinoan glaciation (end-Cryogenian, ca. 660 to 635 

Ma, e.g. Hoffmann et al. 2004). Records of the Marinoan glaciation are observed in other 

Neoproterozoic Belts in Brazil, such as the Sergipano and Brasília (Caxito et al. 2012).

 Metamorphism in the Nova Venécia Complex 

The thermodynamic modeling presented in Figs. 6, 7 and 8 suggests that all modeled samples 

depict a similar P-T path, recording peak P-T conditions from aprox. 750-850 °C and 5300-7500 bars 

and conditions of stability of preserved assemblages from aprox. 640-800 °C and 4500-6000 bars. Figure 

11 shows their simplified metamorphic evolution, related to biotite and muscovite breakdown 

temperature intervals. The metamorphic peak in all samples was attained at granulite-facies conditions 

and all preserved assemblages equilibrated close to the transition between upper amphibolite to granulite 

conditions. CG-3A1 and BGOM-7A1B record very similar peak P-T conditions constrained by the T 

interval of biotite fluid-absent melting reactions. Altough BGCM-101 records lower peak T conditions 

(an area inbetween the T interval of muscovite and biotite fluid-absent melting reactions), there is 

ubiquitous evidence that reactions taking place in this rock-type are typical fluid-absent biotite 

breakdown reactions (e.g. Fig. 5 (a,b)).  

Notably, major crustal melting in peraluminous metasedimentary protoliths involves 

incongruent reactions consisting of muscovite then biotite breakdown, producing high-grade 

assemblages that commonly contain peritectic sillimanite, garnet, cordierite and orthopyroxene (e.g., 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

116 

Clemens 2006, Brown 2007, Taylor et al. 2014). These assemblages, and the proportion of melt 

produced by incongruent reactions, depend on P-T conditions and protolith compositions. As a result, 

different protholiths will produce different melt volumes (e.g. Brown 2007) and different assemblages 

along a given P-T-t path. Predictive modeling of protolith fertility (Clemens and Vielzeuf 1987) suggests 

that metagreywackes may represent the optimum rock compositions for high-scale granitic melt 

production, although pelites are also highly fertile (sometimes more so than metagreywackes). We 

believe that, during peak regional metamorphism, significant crustal melting in the NVC 

metagreywackes generated granitic magmas at high temperatures that equate the conditions of upper 

amphibolite- to granulite-facies metamorphism and that such magmas were produced and extracted from 

the current level of exposure.

S-type granite. All probability density curves were constructed using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2003) by: assigning a 

normal (Gaussian) distribution to each analysis that is less than 15% (compiled data) and 2% (our data) discordant, 

based on 206U/238Pb reported ages and 1? uncertainties; and summing the probability distribution of each 

accepTable analysis into a single curve. 

Considering that peak and preserved assemblages equilibria were achieved at P-T conditions 

shown by the arrows in Figs. 6 (a), 7 (a) and 8 (a), we can make inferences on their depths and amount 

of exhumation. Figure 11 shows that P-T values of equilibria within the restricted fields of peak 

assemblages are ca. 780°C at 7000 bars (BGCM-101), 820 °C at 6500 bars (BGOM-7A1B), 850°C at 

7000 bars (CG-3A1) and of preserved assemblages are ca. 740°C at 5500 bars (BGCM-101), 720 °C at 

4800 bars (BGOM-7A1B), 680°C at 5000 bars (CG -3A1). Therefore, at peak conditions, BGCM-101, 

BGOM-7A1B and CG-3A1 were possibly at depths of ~ 24-25 km whereas the final assemblages 

preserved on the retrograde P-T-t path require depths of ~17-20 km, i.e. ~5-7 km of exhumation. We 

interpret that this exhumation and cooling occurred subsequently to peak metamorphism, but prior to 

the G5 thermal event (520-480 Ma), related to decompression and the AO tectonic collapse. Evidence 

for that is: some of our samples record a late LP-HT overprint (CG-3A1, CG-3A4, CGG-FMC10), 

similarly to other reports from the AO (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2011); and G-7B (519 Ma) sharply intrudes 

the NVC showing no evidence of solid-state deformation related to peak or partial melting linked to the 

exposed migmatites.  

The reason why the metagreywackes record different assemblages are: (1) their protolith 

compositions, also reflected by the fact that each sample contains different percentages of main age 

populations (Table 5)); and (2) some of the samples were affected by two metamorphic events. While 

assemblages in BGCM-101 and BGOM-7A1B (and other samples from outcrops 10, 7 and 11) record 

mostly regional granulitic-peak metamorphism (575 to 560 Ma, next subsection) assemblages in CG-

3A1, CG-3A4 and CGG-FMC10 record two events: the regional metamorphic event and a younger dated 

at ca. 500 Ma (Table 6). We suggest that massive I-type G5 intrusions may have caused a late granulite-

facies metamorphism episode in the NVC rocks (and, by inference, in pre-existing granitic rocks). This 

is analogous to the metamorphic events affecting the Ivre Zone, in northern Italy (Barboza and Bergantz, 

2000). Altought all of our samples record ca. 500 Ma ages, only the samples located close to the G5 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

119 

Pedra do Elefante Batolith clearly record a LP/HT overprint in their assemblages: newly-formed 

euhedral to subhedral cordierite (Fig. 5 (l, v)) and the presence of anhedral to subhedral hercynitic spinel, 

always associated with crystals of magnetite ± ilmenite within cordierite crystals (Fig. 5 (m)). From our 

samples, we can only infer metamorphism within contact aureoles, which is consistent with Pedrosa-

Soares et al. (2011) previous suggestions that G5 intrusions may have caused contact metamorphism in 

granites and metasedimentary rocks throughout the AO. However, it is possible that this late event may 

have affected assemblages in the whole AO. 

 

Figure 11 - Suggested and simplified metamorphic evolution for all samples related to granulite and amphibolite 

conditions of metamorphism and to temperature intervals where biotite and muscovite breakdown most likely 

occur (Vielzeuf and Holloway, 1988; Patiño Douce and Johnston, 1991; Montel and Vielzeuf, 1997; Stevens et al. 

1997; Pickering and Johnston, 1998). Peak metamorphism in all samples was attained at granulite conditions and 

all preserved assemblages must have equilibrated close to the transition between upper amphibolite to granulite 

conditions. 

 Metamorphic history of the Araçuaí Orogen as recorded by the Nova Venécia 

Complex 

Metamorphism recorded in zircons and monazites in our samples can be grouped into 4 periods, 

as presented in Table 6. Group 1 (ca. 590 Ma) is recorded in outcrop 7, where the magmatic 

crystallization of PG-7D can be related to metamorphism recorded in zircons from BGOM-7A1B. This 

group is interpreted to record an early period of peraluminous magmatism, within the 595-570 Ma range 

of G1 + G2 plutonism (Fig. 10(a-b)). Group 2 is recorded by metamorphic zircons and monazites in 

BGOM-7A1B, BGCM-101, CG-3A1 and G-7D. In this study, this group is interpreted to represent the 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

120 

AO peak metamorphism ranging from ca. 571 to 560 Ma, causing partial melting in both 

metagreywackes and early granites (e.g. PG-7D; Fig. 4). Notwitstanding the complexities of the regional 

geology, it seems reasonable to assume that peak regional metamorphism in the Araçuaí Orogen lasted 

15 My, between 575 and 560 Ma, through combining the peak ages determined in previous studies (575 

Ma, e.g. de Campos et al. 2004, Gradim et al. 2014) and those obtained here. This period is similar to 

the period of peak granulitic metamorphism in the central-north part of the Ribeira Belt (575-560 Ma; 

Bento dos Santos et al. 2011). Notably, these ages partly overlap with the syn-collisional period of 

magmatism (G1 + G2, 595-570 Ma) with a peak at ca. 575 Ma (Fig. 10 (a-b)). This suggests a 

relationship between the peak regional metamorphism recorded in our samples and the youngest portion 

of the G1 + G2 plutonism, which needs further detailed investigation. We infer that the products of 

partial melting generated during peak throughtout the AO could be at least part of the granitoids 

contemporaneous to G2 (570-540 Ma) and G3 + G4 (540-525 Ma) periods (Fig. 12). This agrees with 

the suggestion of Bento dos Santos et al. (2015) that, in the Northern Ribeira Belt and AO, magmatism 

took place at 584-544 Ma and metamorphism at 587-560 Ma within a syn-orogenic period. In our study, 

however, late granitogenesis and metamorphism is also remarkably significant. For instance,  in outcrop 

7, the sharply intrusive G-7B records magmatic crystallization at ca. 519.3 ± 2 Ma, which is registered 

by metamorphic-related zircon age of 523.2 ± 9 Ma and monazite age of 513.0 ± 4 Ma in PG-7D (Group 

3, Table 6). In addition, Group 4 represents the G5 thermal event at ca. 500 Ma, recorded in 

metagreywackes (monazites) and in granites (monazites and zircons). We infer that ages at ca. 523-495 

Ma are linked to partial dissolution of peak 575-560 Ma zircon and monazite in restricted partial melts 

and then re-precipitation of new anatectic zircon and monazite. Moreover, during this period, CG-3A1, 

CG-3A4 and CGG-FMC10 were affected by a late metamorphic event. According to all supramentioned 

observations, we suggest that the supply of magma arising from deep crustal levels throughout the AO 

was probably continuous from syn- to post-collisional periods (Fig. 10(a-b)), altought they were more 

significant during ca. 590-560 Ma and 520-480 Ma.

CHAPTER 7  

CONCLUSIONS 

Conclusions based on field observations, petrography, metamorphic modeling and 

geochronology, summarized in Figure 12 (chapter 6), are:  

(1) Among the seven population that compose our detrital zircon dataset, the two youngest indicate that 

the main provenance of the NVC is the Rio Doce Arc, from 650-610 Ma, likely with minor 

contributions from the Rio Negro Arc. This period is similar to the early G1 magmatic period in the 

AO (640-595 Ma). Older populations yield provenance from Cryogenian and Tonian rift-related 

segments in the AO; 

(2) The period of NVC protolith sedimentation is bracketed between its maximum sedimentation age 

at ca. 606 Ma and the intrusion of early peraluminous granitoids (ca. 593 Ma), i.e. ca. 13 My (based 

on outcrop 7). As peak metamorphism in this locality occurred at ca. 570 Ma in depths of ca. 25 km, 

we infer a tectonic burial at rates of 0.8 km/My from 606 to 570 Ma.  

(3) The temporal overlap between the voluminous G1 + G2 Supersuites (595-570 Ma) is interpreted to 

represent the AO syn-collisional period. The peak high-grade regional metamorphism is constrained 

from 575 to 560 Ma, encompassing part of the syn-collisional period. Thus the peak metamorphism 

in interpreted to be related to G1 + G2 magmatism.  

(4) The reason why samples record different assemblages is a protolith compositional parameter and 

not major differences in their P-T evolution. Metagreywackes record peak P-T conditions from 

aprox. 750-850 °C and 5300-7500 bars, at granulite conditions, close or within the T interval that 

allows biotite-breakdown melting reactions. P-T conditions of stability of preserved assemblages 

was from aprox. 640-800 °C and 4500-6000 bars, close to the transition between upper amphibolite 

to granulite conditions. 

(5) The G5 thermal event (520-480 Ma) is recorded in monazites (metagreywackes and granites) and 

in zircon (in granites) in all our samples from 523 to 495 Ma. We infer it caused a partial LP-HT 

overprint in pre-existing regional high-grade assemblages. In our samples, this overprint is limited 

to inferred metamorphic contact aureoles (e.g. samples CG-3A1, CGG-FMC10), generating 

texturally late cordierite and hercynitic spinel. Thus, it is suggested that two main high-grade 

metamorphic events took place in the AO: one early regional metamorphism at ca. 575-560 Ma; and 

a younger local LP-HT metamorphic event (ca. 500 Ma).

APPENDIX A – METHODS 

A.1. XRF Analysis 

Whole-rock chemistry analysis was performed at the Department of Earth Sciences, Stellenbosch 

University, South Africa. Samples were crushed to a fine powder using a jaw crusher and swing mill, 

and glass disks prepared for XRF analysis using 1.5 g of high purity trace element and REE element 

free flux (LiBO2 = 80%, Li2B4O7 = 20%) mixed with 0.28 g of the rock sample. Whole-rock major 

element compositions were determined by XRF spectrometry on a Philips 1404Wavelength Dispersive 

spectrometer. The spectrometer is fitted with an Rh tube, analyzing crystals LIF200, LIF220, LIF420, 

PE, TLAP and PX1. The instrument is fitted with a gas-flow proportional counter, a scintillation 

detector. The gas-flow proportional counter uses a 90% Argon, 10% methane gas mixture. Major 

elements were analyzed on a fused glass disk at 50 kV and 50mA tube operating conditions. Matrix 

effects in the samples were corrected for by applying theoretical alpha factors and measured line overlap 

factors to the raw intensities measured with the SuperQ Philips software. Control standards that were 

used in the calibration procedures for major element analyses were AGV (Andesite from the United 

States Geological Survey, Reston), NIM-G (Granite from the Council for Mineral Technology, South 

Africa) and BHVO-1 (Basalt from the United States Geological Survey, Reston). 

A.2. Zircon and monazite U-Pb LA-Q-ICP-MS  

Prior to the analysis, samples were prepared in LOPAG. Zircon and monazite grains were separated 

from the chosen samples (3A1, 7A1B, 7B, 101, 114) by rock crushing, concentration of heavy minerals 

(heavy liquid separation), magnetic separation and individual selection and handpicking of grains with 

the use of a petrographic low-magnification microscope. Grains were hand-picked and  mounted  in 2.5 

cm diameter epoxy disks, which were polished to expose grain centres. Cathodoluminescence images 

were produced in the Department of Geology from the University of São Paulo.  

The analysis was performed using the LA-Q-ICP-MS (quadrupole laser ablation-inductively coupled  

plasma-mass spectrometry) method. Isotopic analysis of several zircon crystals were obtained via laser 

ablation Quadrupole-Q-ICP-MS followed the technique described in Takenaka (2015). Pb/U and Pb/Pb 

isotopic ratios were measured using An Agilent 7700x quadrupole ICP-MS coupled to a 213 Nd-YAG 

laser (New Wave Research UP-213). The laser was set up to produce energy density of ca. 8 J/cm2 at a 

repetition rate of 10 Hz, producing spots of 30 ?m in the sample. As primary reference material, we used 

the GJ-1 zircon (608.5 ± 0.4 Ma; Jackson et al. 2004) and for quality control, we used, as secondary 

standard, the Plešovice zircon (337.1 ± 0.4 Ma; Sláma et al. 2008). Fifty-three analyses of Plešovice 

zircon gave a Concordia age of 338.4 ± 1.4 Ma (MSWD (of conc+equiv) =1.30); mean 206Pb/238U age = 



Richter F. 2015. Sedimentation, metamorphism and granite generation in a back-arc region  

136 

338.5 ± 3.2 Ma (MSDW = 0.04); mean 207Pb/235U age = 337.4 ± 1.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.43). The 

background data were acquired for 20 s followed by 40 s of laser ablation signal. The relevant isotope 

rations (207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/232Th, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U, where 235U is 

calculated from 238U counts by abundant natural reason 235U = 238U/137.88) were processed using 

the Glitter software package and plotting and age calculations were done using the Excel-based Isoplot 

program (Ludwig, 2012). The data reduction included the correction of fractionation problems and of 

errors in the mass counting.   

A.3. In-situ monazite U-Pb LA-ICP-MS  

Monazite grains were dated in thin section in the Stellenbosch University Central analytical facility 

(CAF) ICP-MS unit using an Agilent 7500ce quadrupole ICP-MS coupled to a 213 nm New Wave laser. 

Prior to analysis monazite grains were imaged in BSE (back-scattered electron) mode using a ZEISS 

EVO MA15VP SEM housed in the Central Analytical Facility (CAF; Stellenbosch University) electron 

micro-beam unit. Operating conditions for monazite are described in Buick et al. (2011) and were 

optimised to provide maximum sensitivity for the high masses (Pb–U) while inhibiting oxide formation 

(ThO+/Th+&lt;0.5%). Ablations occurred in a custom-built small-volume, teardrop-shaped sample cell 

(cf. Horstwood et al. , 2003) in a He carrier gas, and the resulting aerosol was mixed with Ar prior to 

introduction into the ICP-MS via a signal-smoothing manifold. Initial data reduction used the Glitter 

software package (van Achterbergh et al. , 2001) to calculate the relevant isotopic ratios (207Pb/206Pb, 

208Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/232Th, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U). 235U was calculated from 238U counts via the natural 

abundance ratio 235U = 238U/137.88 (Jackson et al. , 2004). Individual isotopic ratios were displayed in 

time-resolved mode. Isotopic ratios generated during the first 5-10s of each analysis were not used, and 

from the remainder of each analysis the integration window was chosen so as to maximise concordance 

(Jackson et al. , 2004). Ablation depth-dependent elemental fractionation was corrected for by tying the 

integration window for the unknown monazite to the identical integration window of the standard 

(Jackson et al. , 2004). 

Instrumental drift was corrected against the monazite standard using linear interpolative fits. The U-Pb 

data (Table X) were plotted on a Wetherill concordia diagram using the software Isoplot (Ludwig, 2001). 

Uncertainties in these Tables were propagated assuming a 1% uncertainty on the age of the standards. 

204Pb-based common Pb corrections were not applied because of the well-known contamination of the 

carrier gases by 204Hg (e.g. Jackson et al. , 2004). 

The analytical runs involved repeated analysis cycles of the USGS 46609 standard (424.9 Ma; 

Aleinikoff et al. , 2006), used as the primary standard, Thompson Mine monazite (1766 Ma; Williams 

et al. , 1996), used as a control/secondary standard, and 6-8 analyses of monazite from the thin section. 

Integration times for U/Pb age determinations were 15 ms for 206Pb, 40 ms for 207Pb, and 10 ms for 208Pb, 

204Pb, 232Th and 238U. LA-ICP-MS acquisitions consisted of a 60 second measurement of the gas blank, 



Contribuições às Ciências da Terra, M.74, 326, 160p. 

137 

followed by 40 seconds of measurement of U, Th and Pb signals during ablation. Laser ablations were 

performed at a frequency of 4 Hz and an energy density of ~4.5-5 J/cm2, and produced 20 m diameter 

wide pits. As noted by Buick et al. (2011), a problem with U/Pb analysis of monazite at Stellenbosch 

University using the above set-up is a matrix affect that occurs when the low-Th Palaeozoic 46609 

monazite standard is used to date older (Mesoprotoerozoic and older) monazite. The LA-ICP-MS U-Pb 

isotope analyses of the old monazite are reversely discordant, even when independent TIMS analyses 

show that this monazite is concordant. This was the case in the present study where analyses of the 

nominally concordant high-Th Thompson Mine secondary standard were 7-13% reversely discordant. 

However, as noted by Buick et al. (2011) the weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of the monazite is 

unaffected. This was found to be the case in the, present study, where the weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age 

of 9 analyses of the Thompson Mine monazite was 1753±17 Ma (95% confidence level, or c.l.; MSWD 

= 0.57), within error of the accepted value. 

For sample 114, 16 LA-ICP-MS analyses were made in thin section. Unfortunately, 7 of these were 

apatite inclusions, rather than monazite. Of the remaining 9 analyses all were concordant (98-100% 

based on the agreement between 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U ages), but not all were the same age. Two 

concordant analyses had apparent spot 206Pb/238U ages of  c. 550 Ma (analyses MNZ_6  and _9). The 

remaining seven analyses were younger and could be  combined  together to  yield a concordia age of 

502.1 ± 6.3 Ma (2 ; MSWD of concordance and equivalence  = 0.51). 

A.4. Mineral Chemistry 

Mineral chemistry analysis was performed at Stellenbosch University. Prior to imaging and analysis, 

the thin sections were sputter-coated with carbon. Samples were analyzed by a energy-dispersive X-ray 

spectroscopy (EDS) using a Zeiss EVO MA 15 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) fitted with an 

Oxford Instrument Wave Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer and Oxford INCA Software. Beam conditions 

during the analysis were 20.00 kV and approximately 1.0 A, with a working distance of 8.5 mm and a 

specimen beam current of -20.00 nA.  Analyses were quantified using natural mineral standards.
