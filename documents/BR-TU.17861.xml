ABSTRACT 
 
Benthic macrofauna zonation was studied for one year (June 2004 to May 2005) with monthly 
sampling on Cassino Beach, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Three sites (spaced 50 m apart) were 
selected. Three transects were anchored at each site, spaced equidistantly 2 m apart. Each transect 
extended from the base of the primary dunes to the inner surf zone at approximately 1m in depth, 
with between 7 and 8 sampling levels. Monthly, with a 20 cm diameter core, one biological sample 
was collected per transect at each level, a total of nine samples  per level. Within transects, the 
distance between the levels was 20 m until the upper swash zone, from which the distance was 10 m 
until the 1-meter isobath. Zonation proved to be variable throughout the year. Variability was mainly 
a reflection of the greater instability of the lower part of the beach, which comprised the lower 
mesolittoral zone and the inner surf zone. This was evidenced seasonally with the formation of 
distinct groups of fauna in accordance with the peculiarity of each season of the year. The formation 
of these groups was strongly influenced by fluctuations in densities stemming from recruitments and 
the migration of juvenile and adult infauna, as well as superimposing of the distribution of organisms 
as a result of rises in sea level due to storms.  
 

RESUMO 
 
A zonação da macrofauna bentônica na praia do Cassino, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, foi estudada 
durante um ano (junho 2004 a maio de 2005) com base em coletas mensais. Para isso escolheu-se 3 
locais, com 50 m de distância um do outro, sendo que em cada local foram fundeadas 3 transversais 2 
m eqüidistantes. Cada transversal se estendeu desde a base das dunas primárias até aproximadamente 
1m de profundidade no infralitoral, sendo 7 a 8 níveis de coleta distribuídos em cada uma das 
transversais. Mensalmente, utilizando-se um tubo extrator de 20 cm de diâmetro, coletou-se uma 
amostra biológica por transversal em cada nível, totalizando nove amostras por nível. A distância dos 
níveis de coleta em cada transversal foi de 20 m até o limite superior da zona de varrido, a partir da 
qual a distância foi de 10 m. A zonação mostrou-se variável ao longo do ano, sendo que esta 
variabilidade refletiu, principalmente, a maior instabilidade da zona inferior da praia, que 
compreendeu o mesolitoral inferior e a zona de arrebentação interna. Isto ficou evidenciado 
sazonalmente, com a formação de distintos grupos faunísticos de acordo com a peculiaridade de cada 
estação do ano. A formação destes grupos foi fortemente influenciada pelas flutuações das 
densidades, decorrentes dos recrutamentos e migrações de juvenis e adultos da infauna, e da 
sobreposição da distribuição dos organismos, em função da elevação do nível da água devido às 
ressacas.

INTRODUCTION 
 

Beaches are dynamic environments where 
elements such as wind, water and sand interact, 
resulting in complex hydrodynamic and depositional 
processes (BROWN; MCLACHLAN, 1990). The 
peculiar demands or tolerations of each species to 
different ecological factors result in a vertical 
distribution of organisms in characteristic zones, 
which is known as zonation.  

Despite the difficulty in identifying zonation 
on sandy beaches, some schemes have been proposed. 
Based on the distribution of crustaceans, Dahl (1952) 
proposed a universal division into three zones. Salvat 
(1964) proposed a zonation scheme that divides 
beaches into four zones (dry sand, retention, 
resurgence  and  saturation  zones)  based  on  physical 
factors. In spite of these and other proposals, 
controversy remains regarding the validity of zonation 
definition schemes on sandy beaches (RAFFAELLI et 
al., 1991). 



 

It has been verified that the zonation pattern 
of macrofauna changes according to the type of beach, 
and the number of zones increases from reflective 
beaches to dissipative beaches (DEFEO et al., 1992a; 
JARAMILLO et al., 1993). 

An analysis of macrofauna in the 
mesolittoral zone of 15 beaches in the state of Rio de 
Janeiro (Brazil) indicated more than one zonation 
scheme. There was the recognition of two or three 
biological zones, and reflective beaches presented a 
more stable pattern of two zones (VELOSO et al., 
2003).  

In a study carried out on a sandy beach in the 
state of Paraná (Brazil), a persistent pattern of four 
fauna zones was recorded throughout the year 
(SOUZA; GIANUCA, 1995). Also in Paraná, a study 
analyzing the influence of morphodynamics on the 
benthic community of 10 beaches recognized 4 fauna 
zones following the scheme proposed by Salvat (1964) 
(BORZONE et al., 1996). Borzone and Souza (1997) 
verified that macrofauna zonation adjusted to the 
Salvat (1964) scheme, but evidenced temporal 
variations in zonation patterns, which were more 
related to the stability of the sediment than tide levels. 
Based on data from six beaches, Barros et al. (2001) 
demonstrated that the macrofauna zonation pattern 
was better adjusted to the Salvat (1964) scheme, with a 
small difference between the winter and summer 
results.  

The Uruguayan coast on the border of the 
state of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) biogeographically 
constitutes what is known  as the Riogrande-
Uruguayan Sector, due to the similarity in the fauna 
composition of sandy beaches (ESCOFET et al., 
1979). A one-year accompaniment of macrofauna 
zonation at Barra del Chuy (Uruguay) indicated the 
existence of three zones between the supralittoral zone 
and the lower levels of the swash zone (BRAZEIRO; 
DEFEO, 1996). However, the authors identified an 
important variation in the zonation of organisms 
throughout the seasons of the year, which reinforces 
the need for temporal follow-ups of the benthic 
macrofauna in the Riogrande-Uruguayan Sector.    

On the northern coast of the state of Rio 
Grande do Sul (Brazil), daily accompaniment (for five 
days) of benthic macrofauna zonation between the mid 
mesolittoral zone and the beginning of the surf zone 
on three sandy beaches, distinguished only two fauna 
zones (NEVES; BEMVENUTI, 2006). Despite work 
carried out regarding the composition and distribution 
of benthic macrofauna on beaches along the southern 
coast of Rio Grande do Sul (GIANUCA, 1983, 1987; 
BORZONE; GIANUCA, 1990), there is a lack of 
approaches regarding quantitative sampling with 
replication between the supralittoral zone and the 
lower bounds of the swash zone. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the vertical distribution 

of benthic macrofauna during the four seasons of the 
year on a sandy beach on the southern coast of Rio 
Grande do Sul. 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 

Study Area 
 

The sandy beaches of southernmost Brazil 
are exposed, with a slight decline, fine sand, moderate 
to strong wave action and well-developed surf zone, 
presenting dissipative to intermediate morphodynamic 
states (GIANUCA, 1988; GARCIA; GIANUCA, 
1998; BORZONE; GIANUCA, 1990). The 
astronomical tides are insignificant, and 
meteorological factors are the main cause of variations 
in water level (CALLIARI;  KLEIN, 1993).  

Cassino Beach, Rio Grande (RS) presents 
dissipative characteristics in the area near the jetties of 
Barra de Rio Grande, whereas 17.2 km southwards of 
the western jetty (052º 14’ 040 W and 32º 15’ 554 S) 
(Fig. 1), intermediate characteristics were observed 
(CALLIARI; KLEIN, 1993; PEREIRA, 2005).  
 For the zonation denomination, the 
nomenclature proposed by Gianuca (1998) for Cassino 
beach was used. The supralittoral level is a zone under 
the effect of sea spray, which is only inundated by the 
ocean during extreme events, such as tides of storms. 
The mesolittoral corresponds to the zone inundated by 
the tides, with the swash zone in its lower bounds, 
which is subjected to the swash and backwash of 
waves. The upper bounds of the infralittoral was 
denominated the inner surf zone, which is 
characterized by shallow sandy bottoms and turbulent 
between the lower swash zone and approximately 2 m 
in depth.  
 

Sampling 
 

The sampling of benthic macrofauna was 
performed monthly for a period of 12 months (June 
2004 to May 2005). Three sites were selected at a 
distance of 50 m from each other. At each site, 3 
transects were demarked, 2 m equidistant from one 
another. Each transect extended from the base of the 
primary dunes to the inner surf zone at approximately 
1 m depth, with between 7 and 8 collection levels.  
Monthly one biological sample was  collected per 
transect at each level, a  total of  nine samples per 
level.  Within transects, the distance between the 
levels was 20 m until the upper swash zone, from 
which distance was 10 m until the 1-meter isobath 
(Fig. 1). The smaller distance between levels on the 
lower parts of the beach was due to the greater number 
of species and organisms that tend to concentrate in 
this area (GIANUCA, 1983). 

Biological samples were collected using a 
core  of  20  cm  diameter  (0.031416 m2), sunk into 
the  sediment  to  a  depth  of  20  cm,  as  most  of  the

macrofauna was collected. 

 
macrofauna abundance is found in the first 15-20 cm 
of depth in the sediment (BALLY, 1983). Samples 
were sieved with a nylon mesh with a 0.5 mm pore 
opening, and the material collected was fixed in a 10 
% formaldehyde solution. In the laboratory, organisms 
were quantified and identified to the smallest possible 
taxonomic level under a stereoscopic microscope. 

A monthly quantification was also 
performed on the number of Ghost Crab burrows 
(Ocypode quadrata), which were mainly located in the 
supralittoral zone. The method utilized to quantify the 
density of O. quadrata through the number of burrows 
was also used by Neves and Bemvenuti (2006) and 
Alberto and Fontoura (1999) in works carried out on 

the coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Starting 
from the bases of the primary dunes, 100 m lines 
parallel to the beach were established. These lines 
were anchored in the area of occurrence of the O. 
quadrata burrows at a distance of 5 m from one 
another. Through the continuous arrangement of 1x1m 
grid, the density of burrows along each line was 
recorded.  

Regarding the bivalve Mesodesma 
mactroides,  organisms  with a shell  length  between 1 
and 10 mm were defined as recruits; those with 10.1 – 
42.9 mm were defined as juveniles; and as adults, 
those with a shell length greater than 43 mm,

according to the procedure proposed by Masello and 
Defeo (1986) and Defeo et al. (1992b). Recruits, 
juveniles and adults of the bivalve Donax hanleyanus 
were defined respectively as organisms of 1-5 mm, 
5.5-15 mm and &gt;15 mm in length, following Defeo 
and de Alava (1995). 

For the analysis of the spatial variation of the 
benthic macrofauna, samples pertaining to each level 
at each site were totaled on a monthly basis. 

 
Environmental Data 

 
Seasonal sediment samples were taken at 

each of the levels of the 3 sites. The grain size analysis 
of sediment were performed through the proportions 
of sand, silt and clay in the sediment were determined 
through sieving (&gt; 0.062 mm in diameter) and 
pipetting (&amp;lt;0.062 mm in diameter), following 
procedures described by Suguio (1973). During the 
monthly sampling, wave height (visual observations), 
average wave period (digital chronometer) and salinity 
(optical refractometer) were recorded, along with air 
and water temperatures Using a fixed reference, the 
monthly topographic profile of the beach was obtained 
for the central transversal at Site 2. For such, a dumpy 
level was used. Hourly data on wind speed and 
direction were provided by the Barra de Rio Grande 
Pilotage Authority.  

To characterize the seasonal 
morphodynamics state of the beach, the Dean’s 
dimensionless parameter (?=Hb/Ws.T) was 
employed, where Hb is the wave height of the surf, Ws 
is the rate of sediment decantation and T is the wave 
period.  The ? values less than 1 represent reflective 
beaches; intermediate beaches are classified within the 
1 to 6 interval; and dissipative beaches present ? 
values greater than 6 (SHORT; WRIGHT, 1983). 
 

Statistical Analyses 
 

In order to analyze the zonation and possible 
variations of the benthic macrofauna distribution 
throughout the year, statistical analyses were 
performed on the PRIMER v5 program (Plymouth 
Routines in  Multi Ecological Research) using 
quantitative data (CLARKE; WARWICK, 1994). For 
the multivariate analyses, the sum of the samples of 
each level, for site, was used to draw up a similarity 
spreadsheet (Q mode) using the Bray-Curtis 
dissimilarity index. The spring and summer data and 
the annual total were transformed into ?? due to the 
considerable difference in the density of individuals 
(CLARKE;  GREEN, 1988). Multi-Dimensional 
Scaling (MDS) analysis was then performed to find 
the groups. This analysis is considered the most robust 
to verify the benthic macrofauna zonation on sandy 
beaches (KENKEL; ORLOCI, 1986; RAFFAELLI et 
al., 1991). The difference between groups was tested 
through the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), at a 

significance level of p&lt;5% and R statistic &gt; 0.5. 
Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) was used for 
the determination of dissimilarity between the groups 
formed and to verify the contribution of the principal 
species in the groups formation. Levels 1 and 2 
(supralittoral) were not considered in the multivariate 
analyses, as they presented only benthic macro-
invertebrates originating from the stranding, i.e. 
organisms that were flung to these levels by storms. 
The vast majority of them were dead at the time of 
sampling.   

The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H’) 
and the Peilou evenness index (J') were also 
determined for each level. 

 
RESULTS 

 
Environmental Variables 

 
 Minimum salinity was recorded during the 
July  sampling (29 ‰)  and  maximums  in January 
(36 ‰) and March (36 ‰). Water temperature of the 
inner surf zone followed the same tendency as air 
temperature, with minimums recorded in July (water = 
14ºC and air = 15ºC) and May (water = 13.5ºC and air 
= 15ºC), and the maximum in January (water = 26ºC 
and air = 30ºC). Wave height presented higher values 
in November (1.5 m) and July (1 m), whereas the 
average wave period ranged from 8 to 11.9 sec. 
Average declivity of the beach was 1.7º throughout the 
sampling period. 

From the ? values, it was determined that 
the beach studied presented an intermediate stage 
throughout the four seasons of the year (Table 1). The 
sediment type for most of the area was classified as 
fine sand, but on some occasions medium sand 
predominated on the lower part of the beach (Table 1). 
The beach presented constant erosion and accretion 
throughout the year, but the profiles that composed the 
summer were more stable (Fig. 2). 

During the 7 days prior to sampling of the 
benthic macrofauna, NE wind was the most frequent, 
with a maximum velocity of 26.4 m.s-1 in October. 
The SW wind was more frequent in periods of lower 
temperature, but its maximum velocity of 25.1 m.s-1 
occurred in March (Table  2). 
 

Benthic Macrofauna 
 
 A total of 18 taxa were collected in winter 
(June, July and August). Crustacea was the most 
diverse,  followed  by polychaeta, which also occurred 
in the other seasons. At Level 4, there was a greater 
average index of diversity (H’=1.29) and greater 
average density of macrofauna, but the highest number 
of taxa occurred at Level 6 (Table 3). 

MDS and ANOSIM analyses determined the 
formation of 3 groups: Level 3, Level 4 and Levels 5 
to  8  (ANOSIM 3x4 R=0.9 and p=0.1%; 3x5-8 R=0.8

and p=0.1%; 4x5-8 R=0.5 and p=0.1%) (Fig. 3a). 
Through the SIMPER analysis, the dissimilarity 
between groups 3x4, 3x5-8 and 4x5-8 was 87%, 96% 
and 86%, respectively. Table 4 displays the 
contribution percentages of the main taxa in the 
formation of the distinct groups. 

A total of 21 taxa were collected in spring 
(September, October and November). Level 4 had the 
greater average index of diversity (H’=1.02), whereas 
Level 5 presented the greatest average density and 
Level 7 contained the highest number of taxa (Table 
5). 
 The formation of 2 groups was verified: one 
formed by Level 3 and the other by Levels 4 to 7 
(ANOSIM R=0.8 and p=0.1%) (Fig. 3b). The 
difference between these groups was 76%. Table 4 
displays the percentages of the main taxa that formed 
each group. 

A total of 21 taxa were found in summer 
(December, January and February). For the period, 
Level 6 presented the greater average index of 
diversity (H’=1.35) and highest number of taxa, 

whereas Level 5 presented the greatest average density 
(Table 6). 

Four groups were identified: Level 3, Levels 
4-5, Levels 6-7 and Level 8 (ANOSIM 3x4-5 R=0.5 
and p=0.1%; 3x6-7 R=0.8 and p=0.1%; 3x8 R=0.3 and 
p=7.7%; 4-5x6-7 R=0.5 and p=0.1%; 4-5x8 R=0.8 and 
p=0.4%; 6-7x8 R=0.6 and p=0.5%) (Fig. 3c). There 
was no significant difference between Levels 3 and 8. 
The likely cause for this was the abrupt reduction in 
the density of Euzonus furciferus at Level 3, which 
was the characteristic species of the level. The 
difference between groups 3x4-5, 3x6-7, 4-5x6-7, 4-
5x8 and 6-7x8 were 70%, 83%, 55%, 69% and 49%, 
respectively. Table 4 displays the percentages of the 
main taxa in the formation of each group. 
 A total of 22 taxa were collected in fall 
(March, April and May). Level 4 presented the 
greatest average index of diversity (H’=1.43), whereas 
Level 6 showed the greatest average density. Level 5 
and 6 contained the highest number of taxa for the 
season (Table 7).

Only 2 groups were identified in the period: 
one was formed by Levels 3-4, and the other by Levels 
5 to 8 (ANOSIM R=0.6 and p=0.1%) (Fig. 3d). The 
dissimilarity between these groups was 87%. Table 4 
displays the contribution percentages of the main taxa 
in the formation of each group. 

Based on the analyses of data throughout the 
sampling period, the formation of 2 groups was 
distinguished: one formed by Level 3 and the other by 
Levels 4 to 8 (ANOSIM R=0.6 and p=0.1%) (Fig. 4). 
These groups presented a dissimilarity of 76%. Table 

4 displays the contribution percentages of the main 
taxa in the formation of each group. 
  The zonation of the 10 taxa that presented 
the greatest densities throughout the seasons of the 
year indicated a clear spatial/temporal pattern in the 
benthic macrofauna abundance. The greatest densities 
of benthic macrofauna were concentrated in the swash 
zone (Figs 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d). With regard to seasonality, 
the months of spring and, especially, summer 
presented greater benthic macrofauna densities, 
reflecting the recruitments recorded in these warmer 
seasons.

The greatest average density of Ocypode 
quadrata burrows was found in March (0.2125 dens 
m-2), while no burrows were encountered in July, 
August, September, October, December and May. For  
all months in which burrows were found, there was a 
greater concentration in dune proximities, with a 
reduction in number of burrows toward the lower parts 
of the beach. 

 
DISCUSSION 

  
A 3-zone pattern was found based on data 

recorded throughout the year: the supralittoral, where 
the Ghost Crab Ocypode quadrata occurred; the upper 
mesolittoral, characterized by polychaeta Euzonus 
furciferus and the isopod Excirolana armata; and the 
final zone including the lower mesolittoral and inner 
surf zone, which was characterized by the tidal 
migrants clams Donax hanleyanus and Mesodesma 
mactroides, together with the amphipod 
Phoxocephalopsis sp. The fauna of the supralittoral 
zone may be related to the subterrestrial zone 
described by Dahl (1952) and the dry sand zone 
described by Salvat (1964).  In the scheme proposed 
by Dahl (1952), the mesolittoral, which corresponds to 
the retention zone proposed by Salvat (1964), is 
characterized by cirolanid isopods. In the present 
study, Excirolana armata was found in this zone, 
along with Euzonus furciferus, similarly to what was 

observed on Uruguayan beaches (DEFEO et al., 
1992a; GIMÉNEZ; YANNICCELLI, 1997). The third 
fauna zone corresponds to the infralittoral zone of 
Dahl (1952), that includes the resurgence and 
saturation zones of Salvat (1964) (MCLACHLAN, 
1990).  

In a one-year accompaniment of a 
Uruguayan beach with similar characteristics of the 
beach studied in the present work, 3 zones were also 
observed based on the annual average abundance of 
each species. In the study, however, the occurrence of 
the talitrid amphipod Pseudorchestoidea brasiliensis 
was  recorded  in  the  supralittoral zone (BRAZEIRO; 
DEFEO, 1996). An earlier study on Cassino Beach 
reports the occurrence of this amphipod in the 
supralittoral zone (GIANUCA, 1983). As recorded for 
other amphipods in the estuary region of Patos 
Lagoon, this species presents an aggregated 
distribution, which is reflected in its absence from the 
sampling of the present study.   
 In winter, there was the formation of 4 
biological zones: the supralittoral, where the Ghost 
Crab Ocypode quadrata occurred; the upper 
mesolittoral, characterized by Euzonus furciferus and, 
to a lesser degree, Excirolana armata; the mid 
mesolittoral, represented by the amphipod 
Platyischnopidae; and the lower mesolittoral together 
with the inner surf zone, inhabited by the tidal 
migrants Donax hanleyanus and Mesodesma 
mactroides.

The winter zonation pattern presented a 
division of the mesolittoral zone, similar to that found 
by James and Fairweather (1996). Raffaelli et al. 
(1991) concluded that up to 3 zones based on 
macrofauna assemblages could be identified within the 

mesolittoral zone defined by Dahl (1952). The 
division of the mesolittoral zone was mainly due to the 
occurrence of the amphipod Platyischnopidae. The 
low temperatures of the season may determine the 
distribution  of  the  amphipod  in this zone. Charvat et

al. (1990) observed that amphipods were more 
important in the infralittoral than in the mesolittoral 
zone, suggesting that higher temperatures exclude 
amphipods from the upper parts of the beach. 

Another factor that may have influenced the 
division of the mesolittoral zone was the low density 
of organisms found in winter, mainly stemming from 
the absence of recruitments. Even if meteorological 
factors are the main cause of variations in water level 
on the beach studied (CALLIARI; KLEIN, 1993), 
where winds from the south can raise the sea level by 
as much as 2 m (BARLETTA; CALLIARI, 2003), the 
greater frequency of southwestern winds, which 
reached as much as 16.1 m.s-1 in the 7 days prior to the 
sampling, did not cause a significant superimposing of 
organisms, probably due to the low density of benthic 
macrofauna in the period.  

In spring, a 3-zone pattern was found, with 
the supralittoral composed basically of Ocypode 
quadrata, the upper mesolittoral dominated by 
Euzonus furciferus and the lower mesolittoral together 
with the inner surf zone characterized by amphipod 
Bathyporeiapus sp., polychaeta Scolelepis gaucha and 
Mesodesma mactroides. The spring zonation pattern 
fits into Dahl proposal (1952), but, similar to what 
occurred in the upper mesolittoral in winter, the 
cirolanid isopod zone was inhabited mostly by 
Euzonus furciferus. On a dissipative beach in 
Uruguay, Defeo et al. (1992a) observed that 
Excirolana armata and Euzonus furciferus were 
dominant organisms in the mesolittoral zone, the latter 
being responsible for 44% of the overall benthic 
macrofauna on the beach.  

The high densities of Bathyporeiapus sp. and 
Scolelepis gaucha in spring were probably the cause of 
the junction of levels located from the upper swash 
zone to the last level, located in the inner surf zone, 
thereby forming a single broad band that corresponded 
to the infralittoral zone of Dahl (1952).  

On a beach in the state of Paraná (Brazil), 
Bathyporeiapus ruffoi was normally well represented 
in the lower zones of the beach, extending its 
distribution with high abundance into the infralittoral 
zone, especially in the spring months (BORZONE; 
SOUZA, 1997). In the present study area, the action of 
the south, southwest and southeast winds, which 
occurred in the 7 days prior to the sampling, reaching 
velocities of up to 24.6 m.s-1, raised the sea level and 
should have collaborated to the increased density of 
Bathyporeiapus sp. in the mid mesolittoral zone. In 
this zone, the amphipod significantly superimposed its 
distribution  with Scolelepis gaucha, the latter of 
which  a  species  that  present  greater  density  in  the 
mesolittoral zone, with values reaching 100 000 m-2 in 
spring and early summer (SANTOS, 1991).  

On flatter beaches, the lower zones can often 
be fused and divided (DEFEO; MCLACHLAN, 

2005). In Chile, Jaramillo et al. (1993) observed that 
the lower zone of the beach was broader on most 
dissipative beaches in comparison to other types of 
beaches. Giménez and Yannicelli (1997) observed that 
seasonal changes in wind direction may cause a 
variation in the position of the swash zone, leading to 
the superimposing of species and broadening the lower 
zone of the beach. Furthermore, McLachlan (1990) 
verified that species inhabiting the lower zones of the 
beach can extend their distribution to the infralittoral 
zone, which may explain the greater amplitude of the 
lower zone of the beach.  

A differentiated zonation pattern was found 
in summer, when up to 5 zones were identified: the 
supralittoral, composed of Ocypode quadrata; the 
upper mesolittoral, dominated by Scolelepis gaucha 
and Excirolana armata; the mid mesolittoral, 
represented by Scolelepis gaucha and Mesodesma 
mactroides; the lower mesolittoral, inhabited mostly 
by the tidal migrants Mesodesma mactroides and 
Donax hanleyanus together with Bathyporeiapus sp; 
and the inner surf zone, characterized by Mesodesma 
mactroides and Emerita braziliensis (Anomura, 
Hippidae).  

The similarity between the groups that 
characterized the upper mesolittoral and inner surf 
zone was influenced by the low densities of benthic 
macrofauna at the two levels. A relevant factor for this 
similarity was the low density of Euzonus furciferus in 
the  upper  mesolittoral  zone,  a  zone  which was well 
characterized by this species in the other seasons of 
the year. In summer, E. furciferus presented greater 
abundance   at  a  level  below  the  upper  mesolittoral 
zone, but even here its abundance was still not very 
high. The greater abundance at a lower level of the 
beach (mid mesolittoral) may be the result of a damper 
substrate, which would favor the survival of this 
species in summer, season when occur the higher 
incidence of sunlight and warmer temperatures.  

During the summer months, a greater 
number of people visit Cassino Beach, with 
consequently greater vehicle traffic precisely in the 
zone where the polychaeta occur, which may have 
influenced the lower density of Euzonus furciferus for 
the period. Jaramillo et al. (1996) observed no 
evidence of human impact on the benthic macrofauna 
of a Chilean beach, but Gianuca (1983) pointed out 
that vehicles of all types, including trucks used by 
fishermen, affect the macrofauna of Cassino Beach.  

Moreover, the low density of the inner surf 
zone reflects the turbulence of this zone, where 
hydrodynamic conditions are severe and cause 
instability in the substrate. In a study on Dutch 
beaches, Janssen and Mulder (2005) observed a low 
diversity of species together with lower abundance in 
the surf zone.

The possible segregation of the other two 
biological zones (mid and lower mesolittoral) was 
partially due to the greater occurrence of Scolelepis 
gaucha in the mid mesolittoral. Even with the 
superimposing of Mesodesma mactroides recruits in 
the lower part of this zone (the species has two 
recruitment periods – one between November and 
January, and another between February and April 
(DEFEO et al., 1992b), the low frequency of winds 
from the south, except the SE in December, may not 
have been sufficient enough to superimpose the 
species and thereby fuse these zones, as occurred in 
spring. Even with this separation, the 2 zones were not 
as distinct as the upper zones. McLachlan (1990) 
observed that the lower zones of the beach were less 
clearly defined than the upper levels, though the 
definition was still evident. 

In general, we can compare the summer 
zonation pattern to that proposed by Salvat (1964). 
Thus, the supralittoral, upper mesolittoral, mid 
mesolittoral and lower mesolittoral respectively 
corresponded to the dry sand, retention, resurgence 
and saturation zones of Salvat (1964). The inner surf 
zone was much more evident in this season and was 
separated from the lower zones of the beach. 

Similar to the summer zonation pattern 
found in the present study, Barros et al. (2001) and 
Borzone et al. (2003) observed that the resurgence 
zone was characterized by abundance peaks of 
Scolelepis squamata. 

In fall, the 3-zone pattern repeated once 
again, with the supralittoral composed basically of 
Ocypode quadrata, the upper mesolittoral inhabited by 
Euzonus furciferus and Mesodesma mactroides and 
the final zone, including the lower mesolittoral and the 
inner surf zone, was largely characterized by Donax 
hanleyanus. This pattern can be related to that 
proposed by Dahl (1952), but it should be pointed out 
that the zonation scheme the author suggests is only 
based on crustacean distribution, whereas in the 
present study, other classes along with the Crustacea 
were found in the distinct zones of the beach in 
different seasons.  

Euzonus furciferus once again characterized 
the upper mesolittoral in fall, significantly extending 
its distribution to a level below. This was especially 
due to the recruitment of the polychaeta, which 
occurred in this season. Kemp (1988) observed that 
Euzonus mucronata adults were restricted to the upper 
mesolittoral, whereas juveniles settled both within and 
below this zone. This can explain the significant 
expansion in the distribution of Euzonus furciferus at 
this time of year. Throughout the study, E. furciferus 
extended its distribution principally to Level 4, but this  
was only evident in fall, as a result of the recruitment 
of the species. 

In the present study, the lower zone of the 
beach in fall encompassed nearly the entirety of the 
swash zone, and was inhabited largely by Donax 
hanleyanus recruits. Cardoso and Veloso (2003) found 
a similar result for a tropical beach, recording higher 
abundances of this species in winter and fall, when 
recruits were mainly found in the swash zone.  

During the study,  the levels 1 and 2 
(supralittoral) were not considered in the multivariate 
analyses because there were many organisms 
originated from the stranding, i.e. organisms that were 
flung to these levels by storms, without the possibility 
of their returning to the lower parts of the beach, 
consequently interfering in the recognition  of the 
zones. This phenomenon is commonly observed in 
sand beaches of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and 
Argentina, where strong southern winds carry and 
deposit a large number of organisms on the upper parts 
of the beach (Ramírez et al., 2004). 

In summary, zonation on Cassino Beach 
proved to be variable throughout the seasons of the 
year, however, based on the data for the entire year, 
the following general zonation pattern is suggested: 
the supralittoral, characterized by Ocypode quadrata; 
the upper mesolittoral, characterized by the polychaeta 
Euzonus furciferus; and a broad lower zone, more 
variable, including the lower mesolittoral and the inner 
surf zone, characterized by diverse species.  

The two upper zones (supralittoral and upper 
mesolittoral) were more stable throughout the study 
period. Brazeiro and Defeo (1996) observed that the 
supralittoral was the zone that presented greater 
stability over time, which was corroborated in the 
present study. This stability was also recorded for the 
upper mesolittoral zone, principally due to the 
distribution and occurrence of Euzonus furciferus. 
Borzone et al. (1996) concluded that biological zones 
may be more evident in the presence of sedentary 
species than in the presence of migrant ones. Euzonus  
furciferus was found at depths greater than 10 cm in 
the sediment, which should have influenced the greater 
stability of this zone.  

The greater variability of benthic 
macrofauna in the lower zone of the beach, which 
included the lower mesolittoral and the inner surf 
zone, was evident seasonally with the formation of 
distinct fauna groups according to the peculiarity of 
each season.  

In winter, the formation of two groups in the 
lower zone of the beach was mainly due to the low 
density of organisms, reflecting the absence of 
recruitment. Even with the greater frequency of SW 
winds on the days preceding the sampling, with a 
consequent rise in sea level, the low density of benthic 
macrofauna may have impeded the significant 
superimposing of species, resulting in the formation of 

                         NEVES ET AL.: ZONATION OF BENTHIC MACROFAUNA ON CASSINO BEACH                          305



 

two groups. In spring, the high density of individuals 
at the lower levels of the beach, together with strong 
winds that likely raised the sea level, caused the 
expressive superimposing of species resulting in the 
formation of a single large group.  

In summer, recruitments and milder 
hydrodynamic conditions may have led to the 
formation of three groups in the lower zone of the 
beach. Even with the high densities of benthic 
macrofauna, the frequency of winds from south in the 
7 days prior to sampling was probably not sufficient 
enough to cause the superimposing of species. In this 
season, the separation of the group corresponding to 
the inner surf zone became more evident as a result of 
greater densities in the swash zone, reflecting the 
recruitment of tidal migrants. In fall, there was once 
again the formation of a single group in the lower zone 
of the beach, reflecting the recruitment of one tidal 
migrant (Donax hanleyanus) in the swash zone.  

In general, the spatial variability of the 
benthic macrofauna groupings in the lower zone of the 
beach during the distinct seasons of the year was 
strongly influenced by fluctuations in densities 
stemming from both recruitments and the migration of 
juvenile and adult infauna. Another factor that 
influenced the vertical distribution of benthic 
macrofauna was the superimposing of species 
distribution due to the rise in sea level during storms.
