RESUMO 

 

Os primeiros trabalhos de pesquisa mineral no Complexo Luanga datam de 1983 

e desde então, ao longo de mais de 20 anos de pesquisa mineral, a área foi estuda por 

diversas empresas, com foco exploratório em diferentes bens minerais. Em 2001, a 

VALE S.A. deu início a um projeto de exploração com foco em Elementos do Grupo da 

Platina (EGP) na região da Serra Leste, Carajás. Este trabalho apresenta a primeira 

descrição sistemática do Complexo Luanga e seu depósito de EGP, desenvolvida com o 

auxílio das extensiva base de dados gerada pela VALE. 

 Neste cenário, esta dissertação objetiva entender a gênese e evolução geológica 

do Complexo Luanga e seus diferentes estilos de mineralização de EGP. Para isso 

foram realizados trabalhos de campo, mapeamento geológico, descrição e amostragem 

de testemunhos de sondagem, interpretação de seção de sondagem, interpretação de 

dados de geoquímica, petrografia óptica, química de minério, química mineral, 

imageamento em microscópio eletrônico de varredura (MEV) e análises químicas 

isotópicas de isótopos de Sm, Nd e S.  

 O Complexo Luanga é parte da suíte magmática Serra Leste, localizada na 

porção nordeste da Província Mineral de Carajás. O Complexo Luanga é uma intrusão 

de médio porte, que pode ser dividida em três zonas principais: i. Zona Ultramáfica, 

localizada na porção inferior da intrusão, composta por cumulados ultramáficos 

(peridotitos), ii. Zona de Transição, localizada na porção central da intrusão, composta 

por uma intercalação de cumulados ultramáficos e máficos (harzburgito, piroxenito, 

norito) e iii. Zona Máfica, localizada na porção superior da intrusão, composta por uma 

sequência monótona de cumulados máficos (noritos) com intercalações pontuais de 

ortopiroxenito. A Zona Ultramáfica sobrepõe a Zona de Transição, que sobrepõe a Zona 

Máfica, sugerindo assim que o complexo está tectonicamente invertido. A mineralogia 

primária dos cumulados citados é frequentemente substituída em resposta a uma 

transformação metamórfica heterogênea sobreposta. Apesar da recristalização 

mineralógica, a transformação metamórfica preserva as texturas e domínios 

composicionais das rochas magmáticas.  

Diferentes estilos de mineralização de EGP ocorrem ao longo do Complexo 

Luanga, com o destaque para ocorrências associadas a sulfetos disseminados e 

ocorrências sem associação clara com sulfetos e/ou cromititos. O primeiro caso é 

ilustrado por um horizonte de 10-50 metros de espessura, localizado na passagem entre 



 

iv 
 

as Zonas Ultramáfica e de Transição, com uma disseminação de sulfetos (i.e. 3% vol.) 

denominado Sulfide Zone. A mineralogia dos sulfetos é tipicamente pentlandita &gt; 

pirrotita &gt;&gt;&gt; calcopirita, o que resulta em um elevado tenor de Ni (i.e. 16-18%) e alta 

razão Ni/Cu (i.e. 10-12). A Sulfide Zone hospeda a maior parte dos recursos de EGP do 

depósito de Luanga (i.e. 142 Mt@ 1.24g/t EGP+Au e 0.11% Ni).  O segundo estilo de 

mineralização é definido por horizontes de 2-10 metros de espessura, 

estratigraficamente acima da Sulfide Zone, que apresentam concentrações anômalas de 

EGP, denominados silicate-related PGE. As rochas observadas nestes horizontes não 

possuem nenhuma característica textural ou mineralógica que as distinga dos cumulados 

supracitados. Os dois estilos citados apresentam características geoquímicas distintas, 

quanto às concentrações de EGP. A Sulfide Zone possui razões Pt/Pd de 

aproximadamente 0.5 e um padrão de EGP, normalizados ao manto primitivo, típico de 

depósitos de sulfetos magmáticos hospedados em intrusões máfica-ultramáficas. O 

silicate-related PGE possui razões Pt/Pd de aproximadamente 1.2-1.3 e forte depleção 

em Ir e Os. Outra característica importante é a ocorrência de cristais de olivina com até 

7500 ppm de Ni em alguns harzburgitos que hospedam a mineralização do tipo silicate-

related PGE. Tais características sugerem que os dois estilos são formados por 

processos geológicos distintos.  

 Cromititos estratiformes, com textura variada e espessura de até 60 centímetros, 

ocorrem ao longo do Complexo Luanga, hospedados no topo da Zona de Transição e 

base da Zona Máfica. Em função do extensivo processo de metamorfismo que afeta as 

rochas do Complexo Luanga, as composições dos cristais de cromita são modificadas. 

A alteração da composição primária é marcada em cristais zonados, com  Mg# 

(Mg/Mg+Fe
2+

) progressivamente menor do núcleo para a borda. Estas alterações na 

composição primária de cristais de cromita comprometem sua aplicabilidade em estudos 

petrogenéticos. Nossos resultados sugerem que estas feições são comuns em cromititos 

hospedados em rochas alteradas em outros locais no mundo. 

 A composição do magma parental do Complexo Luanga não pode ser obtida por 

métodos diretos, aplicados a intrusões bem expostas e preservadas (i.e. diques 

correlatos, margens de resfriamento, equivalentes extrusivos). Desta forma, a 

composição do magma responsável pela geração de olivinas extremamente ricas em Ni 

e horizontes ricos em EGP na intrusão estudada, não é óbvia. De fato, diferentes 

modelos podem explicar a origem de magmas ricos em Ni e a existência ou não de 

magmas férteis para a geração de depósitos de EGP. Os resultados apresentados 



 

v 
 

suportam a geração de um magma rico em Ni que dá origem ao Complexo Luanga e a 

existência de uma suíte magmática fértil para a geração de depósitos de EGP na porção 

leste da Província Mineral de Carajás.

ABSTRACT 

 

Since 1983 the area of the Luanga Complex has been studied by different mining 

companies, aiming different commodities. In 2001, Vale S.A. started an exploration 

program for PGE in the Serra Leste region. This project resulted in a great volume of 

geological data upon the layered intrusions and related mineralizations of the region. 

This study provides the first systematic study of the Luanga Complex and its PGE 

mineralization supported by the extensive database provided by VALE.  

Based on this scenario, the present dissertation aims the genesis and geological 

evolution of the Luanga Complex and its associated PGE mineralization. To achieve 

this objective we performed field work, geological mapping and sampling, drill core 

description and sampling, reinterpretation of geological sections, detailed petrography, 

mineral chemistry, interpretation of lithogeochemical data, scanning electron 

microscope images (SEM) and isotopic analyses for Sm-Nd and S systematics.   

The Luanga Complex is part of the Serra Leste Magmatic Suite, located in the 

northeastern portion of the Carajás Mineral Province. The Luanga Complex is a 

medium-sized layered intrusion consisting of three main zones: i. the lower Ultramafic 

Zone, comprising ultramafic cumulates (peridotite), ii. the Transition Zone comprising 

interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulates (harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite) 

and iii. the upper Mafic Zone comprising a monotonous sequence of mafic cumulates 

(norite) with minor orthopyroxenite layers. The Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition 

Zone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the layered sequence is 

tectonically overturned. Metamorphic assemblages commonly replace primary igneous 

minerals of the Luanga Complex. This metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous and 

characterized by an extensive hydration that largely preserves primary textures, bulk 

rock compositions and the compositional domains of igneous minerals. 

Different styles of PGE mineralization occur along the Luanga Complex, with 

occurrences associated with disseminated sulfides and occurrences with no clear 

association with sulfides and/or chromites. The first, ascribed as Sulfide Zone, consists 

of a 10 – 50 m thick interval with disseminated sulfides located along the contact of the 

Ultramafic and Transition Zones of the intrusion. The mineralogy of the Sulfide Zone 

consists of base metal sulfides with pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; chalcopyrite, resulting 

in high Ni tenors (i.e. 16-18) and high Ni/Cu ratios (i.e. 10-12). The Sulfide Zone hosts 



 

vii 
 

the bulk of PGE resources of the Luanga Complex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au 

and 0.11% Ni). The other PGE mineralization, ascribed as silicate-related PGE, consists 

of 2-10 m thick stratabound zones across the Transition Zone. These sulfide- and 

chromite-free rocks, mainly harzburgite and orthopyroxenite, do not show any 

distinctive texture or change in modal composition that characterize the PGE 

enrichment. The Sulfide Zone and silicate-related PGE show differences in 

geochemistry behavior of PGE. The Sulfide Zone has Pt/Pd ratios of 0.5 and mantle-

normalized PGE patterns typical of magmatic sulfide deposits hosted in layered 

intrusions. The silicate-related PGE has Pt/Pd ratios of 1.2-1.3 and a strong depletion in 

Ir and Os. A remarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-rich olivines (up to 

7400 ppm Ni) in harzburgites closely associated with silicate-related PGE 

mineralization. The geochemical and textural differences between these mineralization 

styles suggest that they were formed by distinct geological processes.  

 Several variable textured stratiform chromitites, up to 60 centimeters thick, 

occur in the upper portion of the Transition Zone and the lower portion of the Mafic 

Zone. Due to the extensive metamorphic transformation overprinted over the Luanga 

Complex, the primary compositions of chromite crystal are extensively modified. 

Alteration of primary magmatic composition is indicated by zoned crystals with 

progressively lower Mg# (Mg/Mg+Fe
2+

) from core to rim. Significant changes on 

primary compositions of chromite identified in the Luanga Complex compromise their 

application for petrogenetic studies. Our results suggest that these features should be 

common in chromitites hosted in altered rocks worldwide.  

The composition of the parental magma of the Luanga Complex cannot be 

constrained by common approaches used to define their composition in well-exposed 

and well-preserved intrusions (e.g., chilled margin, bulk composition, extrusive 

equivalents, related dykes). Hence, the composition of the parental magma that leads the 

formation of Ni-rich olivines and PGE-rich horizons is not straightforward. Actually, 

different models have been proposed to explain the origin of Ni-rich magmas and the 

existence or not of PGE-fertile suites. The results of this study support the generation of 

a Ni-rich magma that originates the Luanga Complex and the existence of a PGE-fertile 

suite at the eastern portion of the Carajás Mineral Province.

INTRODUÇÃO 

 

 A maior parte dos recursos de Elementos do Grupo da Platina (EGP) está 

concentrada em um pequeno número de intrusões (Cawthorn et al., 2005). Estes 

depósitos podem ser divididos em dois grupos principais, baseados na associação destes 

EGP: i. depósitos de EGP associados a sulfetos e ii. depósitos de EGP associados a 

cromititos. Estes dois grupos podem ser ilustrados pelos depósitos de sulfetos Merensky 

reef, e cromititos do UG2, ambos localizados no Complexo de Bushveld, África do Sul 

(e.g., Barnes &amp;amp; Maier, 2002; Cawthorn et al., 2002 e 2005; Naldrett, 2004). 

 Alguns fatores podem justificar a concentração de recursos de EGP em poucas 

intrusões. Destacam-se a elevada eficiência dos processos que concentram EGP e a 

possibilidade da existência de determinadas províncias magmáticas férteis em EGP. Ao 

que diz respeito aos processos de concentração de EGP, estudos indicam processos 

geológicos com uma eficiência de ordens de 10
5 

(Finnigan et al., 2008; Mungal &amp;amp; 

Naldrett, 2008). Por outro lado, ao que condiz a existência ou não de uma província 

magmática fértil para a geração de depósitos de EGP, tem-se um extenso debate. Alguns 

estudos propõem a existência de províncias que geram magmas de composições 

distintas, que originam depósitos de Ni-Cu-PGE (e.g., Maier &amp;amp; Groves, 2011; Griffin et 

al., 2013). Por outro lado, alguns autores afirmam que os dados obtidos em intrusões 

estudadas ao redor do mundo não suportam a existência destas suítes férteis (e.g., 

Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015). 

 O Complexo Luanga faz parte da suíte magmática Serra Leste (Ferreira Filho et 

al., 2007), localizada na porção nordeste da Província Mineral de Carajás. Esta suíte foi 

definida com base em concentrações anômalas de EGP. Desta forma, o estudo 

sistemático e entendimento da evolução magmática do Complexo Luanga, assim como 

de outros complexos da região (Teixeira et al., 2015) permitem entender quais os 

principais fatores que atuam na formação de depósitos de EGP.  

  Esta dissertação apresenta uma descrição sistemática do Complexo Luanga e 

mineralizações associadas e visa contribuir com o entendimento de processos que levam 

à concentração de EGP. Adicionalmente, o trabalho faz uma caracterização sistemática 

de cromititos que ocorrem ao longo do complexo e uma análise crítica do efeito de 

processos de alteração pós-magmática e metamórfica na composição de cristais de 

cromita. Tal análise crítica pode ser extrapolada para o estudo de rochas ricas em 

cromita de outros complexos ultramáfico-máficos. Por fim, o trabalho destaca a 



 

2 
 

importância de processos de concentração de EGP sem uma associação típica a sulfetos 

magmáticos e/ou cromititos. Os resultado obtidos são comparados a dados da região de 

Carajás e outros complexos máfico-ultramáficos do mundo, desta forma, o Complexo 

Luanga é posicionado em um cenário global.   

  

OBJETIVO, PERGUNTAS E HIPÓTESES 

 

 Este trabalho tem por objetivo principal entender a gênese e evolução geológica 

do Complexo Luanga e seu depósito de Elementos do Grupo da Platina. 

 

 Este objetivo visa responder as seguintes perguntas elaboradas dois anos atrás e 

durante o desenvolvimento da dissertação: 

 

i. Qual a evolução magmática do Complexo Luanga? E qual a estrutura 

magmática deste Complexo? 

ii. Como se deu a formação dos diferentes estilos de mineralizações de EGP do 

Complexo Luanga? 

iii. Qual o impacto de processos pós-magmáticos e metamórficos nos estudo 

petrológicos do Complexo Luanga? Como estes processos podem ser 

extrapolados para diferentes complexos? 

iv. Como os resultados obtidos para o Complexo Luanga se comparam com os 

diferentes complexos ultramáfico-máficos da Província Mineral de Carajás? 

e com os principais complexos do mundo? 

 

Para responder estas perguntas testamos as seguintes hipóteses: 

 

i. O Complexo Luanga apresenta a estrutura típica de intrusões máfica-

ultramáficas acamadas geradas por sucessivos pulsos magmáticos, 
 

ii. Os diferentes estilos de mineralizações de EGP são originados por processos 

magmáticos distintos durante a evolução do Complexo Luanga.  
 

iii. A composição da cromita nas várias camadas de cromititos resulta em 

grande parte de processos pós-magmáticos.  
 

iv. Os teores muito elevados de Ni das olivinas do Complexo Luanga resultam 

da sua cristalização à partir de magmas anômalos para Ni,  



 

3 
 

v. A abundância de intervalos estratigráficos com diferentes estilos de 

mineralização de EGP é resultado de um magma parental originalmente 

enriquecido em EGP.

Abstract 
 

The Luanga Complex is part of the Serra Leste Magmatic Suite, a cluster of PGE-

mineralized mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern portion of the 

Carajás Mineral Province. The Luanga Complex is a medium-sized layered intrusion 

consisting of three main zones: i. the lower Ultramafic Zone, comprising ultramafic 

adcumulates (peridotite), ii. the Transition Zone comprising interlayered ultramafic and 

mafic cumulates (harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite) and iii. the upper Mafic Zone 

comprising a monotonous sequence of mafic cumulates (norite) with minor 

orthopyroxenite layers. Several PGE-mineralized zones occur in the Transition Zone but 

the bulk of the PGE resources are hosted within a 10 – 50 meters thick interval of 

disseminated sulfides at the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition zones. The 

compositional range of cumulus olivine (Fo78.9-86.4) is comparable to those reported for 

layered intrusions originated from moderate primitive parental magmas. Mantle 

normalized alteration-resistant trace element profiles of noritic rocks are fractionated, as 

indicated by relative enrichment in LREE and Th, with negative Nb and Ta anomalies, 

suggesting assimilation of older continental crust. Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga 

Complex (up to 7,500 ppm) stand among the highest values reported in layered 

intrusions globally. The highest Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga Complex occur in 

distinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd &gt; 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, in both 

sulfide-poor and sulfide bearing (1-3 vol.% ) rocks. The origin of the PGE- and Ni-rich 



 

8 
 

parental magma of the Luanga Complex is discussed considering the upgrading of 

magmas through dissolution of previously formed Ni-rich sulfide melts. Our results 

suggest that high Ni contents in olivine and/or orthopyroxene provide an additional 

exploration tool for Ni-PGE deposits, particularly useful for target selection in large 

magmatic provinces.

1.1 - Introduction 

 The Luanga Complex is part of a cluster of PGE-mineralized mafic-ultramafic 

intrusions located in the eastern portion of the Carajás Mineral Province, denominated 

Serra Leste Suite. This suite consists of several small to medium size intrusions that 

host PGE mineralizations of different styles, including PGE associated with chromitite 

layers, stratabound magmatic base metal sulfide zones and hydrothermal alteration 

zones (e.g., Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). These 

layered intrusions have Neoarchean ages (e.g., Machado et al., 1991; Teixeira et al., 

2015) that overlap with the ca. 2.75 Ga extensive basaltic magmatism of the Carajás 

Mineral Province (e.g., Trendall et al., 1998), thus representing coeval magmatic events 

at the scale attributed to large igneous provinces (LIP; Ernst et al., 2005). The spatial 

association of PGE-mineralized layered intrusions of the Serra Leste suite led to the 

suggestion that they originated from a PGE-fertile parental magma (Ferreira Filho et al., 

2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). How magmas with distinctive geochemical characteristics 

that enhance the origin of Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are formed and whether such 

compositions are systematically associated with Ni-Cu-PGE deposits is a debated issue 

(e.g., Zhang et al., 2008; Fiorentini et al., 2010; Griffin et al., 2013). While some studies 

have proposed that LIP containing Ni-Cu-PGE deposits have magmas with distinctive 

geochemical compositions, usually attributed to specific characteristics of the sub-

continental lithosphere (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013), others 

indicate that a systematic association of unusual magmas and magmatic deposits are not 

supported by current data (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015). In this study 

we present anomalously high Ni contents for olivine in rocks of the Luanga Complex. 

Extensive data on olivine compositions have been used to suggest that high Ni contents 



 

9 
 

in olivine occur in mantle melts from sources containing high proportions of recycled 

oceanic crust (i.e., Sobolev et al., 2005 and 2007) due to the predominance of pyroxene 

over olivine in the source. Ni-rich magmas with elevated PGE contents are also 

attributed to processes that lead to the dissolution of previously formed sulfides during 

magma ascent (i.e., Kerr and Leitch, 2005). Our results provide additional data to the 

ongoing debate about whether Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are favored or not by specific 

magma compositions. 

 This paper presents the first extensive geological and geochemical 

characterization of the Luanga Complex, the layered intrusion that hosts the most 

significant stratiform/stratabound PGE mineralization in Carajás (Ferreira Filho et al, 

2007). Our results provide evidence for an anomalous Ni-rich magmatism associated 

with the PGE-mineralized Luanga Complex. These results are compared with previous 

studies of layered intrusions in the Carajás Mineral Province and worldwide in order to 

evaluate the petrological processes that take place during the evolution of PGE-fertile 

districts.  

 

1.2 - Regional setting 

 

1.2.1 – The Carajás Mineral Province 

 The Carajás Mineral Province is one of the most important mineral provinces of 

the South American continent, hosting several Fe, Cu–Au and Ni world-class deposits. 

It is located in the southeastern portion of the Amazonian Craton (Fig. 1.1A), bounded 

by the Neoproterozoic Araguaia Belt in the east and south, and overlain by 

Paleoproterozoic sequences generically assigned to the Uatumã Supergroup in the west 

(Araújo and Maia, 1991; Docegeo, 1988). To the north, where Paleoproterozoic gneiss–

migmatite–granulite terrains predominate (Vasquez et al., 2008), geological limits are 

not precisely defined. The Carajás Mineral Province is subdivided into two Archean 

tectonic domains: the older Mesoarchean Rio Maria Domain to the south and the 

younger Neoarchean Carajás Domain to the north (Fig. 1.1B; Araújo and Maia, 1991; 

Araújo et al., 1988; Dall'Agnol et al., 2006; Docegeo, 1988; Feio et al., 2013). A 

regional E–W shear zone, known as the Transition Subdomain (Feio et al., 2013), 

separates the Rio Maria and Carajás domains.

 The Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite–greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., 

2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual 

Mesoarchean greenstone belts (2904 ± 29 Ma;Macambira and Lancelot, 1996) and 

metasedimentary rocks (Huhn et al., 1986; Souza and Dall'Agnol, 1996; Souza et al., 

2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone belt 

sequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016) 

suggests that granite–greenstone terrains extend further north than indicated in previous 

regional maps. 

 The basement of the Carajás Domain consists mainly of gneiss– migmatite–

granulite terrains of the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; Machado et al., 1991; Pidgeon 

et al., 2000). The evolution of the Carajás Domain, where the study area is located, is 

widely discussed. Different models have been proposed to explain the evolution of the 

Archean volcano-sedimentary sequences, which includes the large sequence of 

metabasalts of the Grão Pará Group (ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., 1991; Vasquez et al., 

2008). While several studies have proposed an intraplate rift model (Gibbs et al., 1986; 

Villas and Santos, 2001), others have suggested subduction-related environments 

(Dardenne et al., 1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). These volcano-sedimentary 

sequences are covered by low-grade metamorphic sequences of clastic sedimentary 

rocks of the Águas Claras Formation (i.e., Rio Fresco Group; Araújo et al., 1988; 

Docegeo, 1988; Nogueira et al., 1994, 2000). 

 Several mafic–ultramafic complexes intrude into both the Xingu Complex and 

the Archean volcano-sedimentary sequences (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., 

2007). These intrusions host large Ni laterite deposits (e.g., Onça-Puma, Vermelho, 

Jacaré) as well as PGE deposits (e.g., Luanga, Lago Grande) and were ascribed as part 

of the Cateté Suite in regional studies (e.g., Macambira and Ferreira Filho, 2002). 

Significant differences in the magmatic structure and evolution of the layered intrusions 

suggest, however, that they belong to different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., 

Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014; Teixeira et al., 2015). 

 

1.2.2 - The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite  
 

 The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster 

of small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern 

portion of the Carajás Mineral Province (Fig. 1.2). Mafic-ultramafic complexes are 

intrusive into gneiss rocks of the Xingu Complex and/or volcanic-sedimentary rocks of 



 

12 
 

the Grão Pará Group. This suite was originally grouped based on abundant PGE 

anomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding any geological, stratigraphic or 

petrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). Recent studies of the Lago 

Grande Complex (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga Complex (this study) are the first 

systematic stratigraphic and petrological investigations of layered intrusions ascribed to 

the Serra Leste Suite, thus providing data for the composition of their parental magmas 

and fractionation processes. Geochronological studies of the Serra Leste Suite are 

restricted to the crystallization age of the Luanga Complex (2,763 ± 6 Ma, U-Pb in 

zircon, Machado et al. 1991) and Lago Grande Complex (2,722 ± 53 Ma, U-Pb in 

zircon, Teixeira et al. 2015). Magmatic ages of the layered intrusions overlap with the 

age of the bimodal volcanism of the Grão Pará Group (2,759 ± 2 Ma, U-Pb in zircon, 

Machado et al. 1991; 2,760 ± 11 Ma, U-Pb in zircon, Trendall et al. 1998), supporting 

the interpretation that they are part of a major Neoarchean magmatic event (Machado et 

al., 1991; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). The architecture of the intrusion and the 

crystallization sequence described in the Luanga and Lago Grande complexes (Fig. 1.2) 

indicate an overturned layered sequence (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 

2015). Even though the tectonic processes leading to the overturned sequence of layered 

rocks in the Lago Grande and Luanga complexes have so far not been studied in detail, 

regional structural studies in the Serra Leste region indicate significant tectonic 

transport that may lead to major overturned blocks (Holdsworth and Pinheiro, 2000; 

Tavares, 2015).

1.3 – Sampling and analytical procedures 
 

 For this study, drill core from eleven boreholes and outcrops rocks were 

systematically sampled in order to select unweathered rocks with primary magmatic 

minerals and textures. The analytical procedures are described as follows.  

1.3.1 - Microprobe analyses 
 

 Mineral analyses were performed on polished thin section using a JEOL 

JXA-8230 SuperProbe with 5 wavelength dispersive (WDS) spectrometers at the 

Electron Microprobe Laboratory of the University of Brasília (Brazil). Systematic WDS 

analyses were obtained for olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Operating conditions 

for the WDS analyses for orthopyroxene and plagioclase were 15 kV accelerating 

voltage, with a beam current of 10 nA and probe diameters of 3 ?m for orthopyroxene 

and 5 ?m for plagioclase. Count times on peak and on background were 10s and 5s 

respectively. Operating conditions for Ni were 15 kV accelerating voltage, with a beam 

current of 100 nA, probe diameters of 3 ?m and count times on peak and on background 

were 60s and 30s, respectively. These different conditions were used because of the 

importance of Ni values for further discussions. Using these analytical conditions, 

detection limits for major elements are around 100 ppm while for Ni the detection limit 

is around 25 ppm. Both synthetic and natural mineral standards were used for the 

analyses and the same standards and procedure were retained throughout the analytical 

work. The results are provided in Online Supplementary Table 1.  

1.3.2 - Bulk rock analyses 
 

Sample preparation and lithogeochemical analyses were performed at ALS 

Chemex (Canada). Analytical procedures include the whole-rock package plus LOI 

(ALS Chemex codes: ME-XRF12st and OA-GRA05x), total S plus total C (ALS 

Chemex codes: S-IR08 and C-IR07) and the 38 elements fusion ICP-MS package (ALS 

Chemex code: ME-MS81). A complete description of analytical methods is available in 

the ALS Chemex Home Page (www.alsglobal.com). Results for representative samples 

are shown in Table 1.1 (see Online Supplementary Table 2 for all analytical data).

1.4 - The Luanga Layered Mafic-Ultramafic Complex 
 

1.4.1 – Geology 
 

 The Luanga Complex consists of a 6 km long and up to 3.5 km wide (~18 km²) 

sequence of mafic-ultramafic layered rocks (Fig. 1.3A). Unweathered rocks are 

abundant compared to adjacent areas of the Carajás Mineral province and consist 

mainly of massive blocks and boulders. The most prominent geomorphologic feature 

consists of an elongated arc-shaped smooth hill sustained mainly by ultramafic rocks, 

up to 60 meters higher than flat areas where gabbroic rocks prevail. The layering forms 

an arc-shaped structure (Fig. 1.3A) that matches the morphology. Host rocks of the 

Luanga Complex consist of highly foliated gneiss and migmatite of the Xingu Complex 

in the south/southeast and mafic volcanics and iron formations of the Grão Pará Group 

in the north/west. 

The central portion of the complex has the thickest sequence of layered rocks. 

To the north and northeastern the layered sequence is truncated by granitic intrusions 

and, to the south, it becomes progressively thinner. The Luanga Complex and host rocks 

are cross cut by NNW-SSE diabase dykes. These vertical dykes are up to several meters 

wide and consist of fine- to medium-grained intergranular to ophitic textured rocks with 

thin aphanitic chilled margins.  Diabase dykes consist mainly of clinopyroxene, olivine 

and plagioclase, with accessory Ti-magnetite. They belong to a Proterozoic swarm of 

magnetic mafic dykes that occurs in the Serra Leste region (Teixeira, 2013; Teixeira et 

al., 2015). 

Geological sections (e.g., Fig. 1.3B) defined by drilling indicate that igneous 

layers have steep dip to the SE. These sections indicate that the Ultramafic Zone 

overlies the Transition Zone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the 

layered sequence is tectonically overturned. An overturned layered sequence was 

previously described for the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and for the 

Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira, et al., 2015). These studies suggest the existence of 

regional scale structures leading to large overturned blocks in the Serra Leste region.  

The subdivision of the Luanga Complex into three zones, Ultramafic, Transition 

and Mafic, is based on different type and/or proportion of cumulus minerals (Fig. 1.3C). 

The estimated thickness of the layered sequence indicated in the stratigraphic column 

(Fig. 1.3C) and schematic block diagram (Fig. 1.4) is constrained by extensive drilling 



 

17 
 

in the central portion of the complex, likely to represent the axial portion of the original 

magma chamber.

minerals along the stratigraphy. 

 



 

18 
 

1.4.1.1 –Ultramafic Zone 
 

 The Ultramafic Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, is up to 800 meters 

thick (Fig. 1.3C) and consists of serpentinites (i.e., metamorphosed peridotite) with a 

few meters thick orthopyroxenite lenses at the upper portions (facing criteria 

considering the overturned sequence). The lower contact of the Ultramafic Zone with 

the Xingu Complex and Grão Pará Group is poorly exposed and was mapped based 

mainly on soil geochemistry surveys. The contact with the overlying Transition Zone is 

gradational and characterized by a 5-10 meters thick sequence of interlayered 

orthopyroxenite and serpentinite. Serpentinite is a massive fine-grained rock  (Fig. 

1.5A), with discrete cross-cutting domains of foliated magnetite-serpentine schist. These 

foliated domains are up to several meters thick and probably result of discrete high 

strain zones. Magmatic textures are usually preserved in massive serpentinites but 

primary igneous minerals are commonly partially to extensively replaced by 

metamorphic minerals. Based upon the domains with best preserved textures and 

minerals, serpentinites are olivine (Ol) cumulates with abundant intercumulus minerals. 

Chromite (Chr) is a common accessory mineral (~ 2 vol.%) suggesting its occurrence as 

a liquidus (or cumulus) mineral throughout the Ultramafic Zone. Chromite occurs in 

relict cores of fine-grained euhedral crystals variably replaced by magnetite (or 

ferrichromite) in the outer rim or along fractures. Serpentinites have variable modal 

proportions of serpentine, chlorite, talc, amphibole (tremolite/actinolite) and magnetite, 

as the result of extensive replacement of olivine and intercumulus minerals. Textural 

and mineralogical features indicate that the Ultramafic Zone consists mainly of olivine 

+ chromite cumulates with ortho- to mesocumulate textures, the later consisting of 

abundant intercumulus plagioclase (Pl) and orthopyroxene (Opx).  

 

1.4.1.2 –Transition Zone 
 

  The Transition Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, comprises an up to 

800 meters thick (Fig. 1.3C) pile of interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks. 

Interlayering of different rocks types in different scales (from a few centimeters up to 

dozens of meters), is a distinctive feature of the Transition Zone. Cumulate rocks have 

variable textures, from adcumulate to orthocumulate, and variable assemblages of 

cumulus and intercumulus minerals. The most common rock types are orthopyroxenite, 



 

19 
 

harzburgite, norite and chromitite, but minor dunite, troctolite, olivine orthopyroxenite 

and melanorite occur in the Transition Zone.

structure where the Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition and Mafic Zones. The downward 

limit of the PGE mineralization is given by drilling. B) Panoramic view of the Luanga 

Complex. Note the contrasting highest relief of the Transition Zone and the flat terrain of the 

Mafic Zone. The higher hill in the back consists of iron formation and volcano-sedimentary 

rocks from the Grão Pará Group.

 Orthopyroxenite is a medium- to coarse-grained orthopyroxene cumulate. The 

texture varies from adcumulate (Fig. 1.5B) to meso- and orthocumulate with plagioclase 

as the predominant intercumulus mineral. The transition from an adcumulate 

orthopyroxenite to orthocumulate rocks (i.e., plagioclase orthopyroxenite or melanorite) 

is commonly gradational and result from continuous upward increase in plagioclase 

content.  

 Harzburgite is a medium- to coarse-grained olivine and chromite cumulate with 

meso- to orthocumululate texture. Most rocks consist of abundant oikocrysts of 

orthopyroxene (harzburgite) or orthopyroxene and plagioclase (plagioclase harzburgite) 

enclosing several olivine and chromite crystals (Fig. 1.5C). Olivine crystals included in 

orthopyroxene oikocrysts show corrosion features (Fig. 1.5D) indicating a peritetic 

reaction of cumulus olivine and intercumulus liquid (i.e, Ol + liquid = Opx).  

 Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase adcumulate rock (Fig 

1.5E). It occurs as discontinuous layers commonly following a gradational upward 

fractionation from orthopyroxenite, to plagioclase orthopyroxenite and norite.

 Chromitite layers with variable thickness and textures occur mainly in the upper 

portions of the Transition Zone and the lowermost portion of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 

1.3C). The thickest chromitite is an up to 60 cm chromite-rich layer located at the 

contact between the upper harzburgite and orthopyroxenite layers from the Transition 

Zone. Several thin chromitites (&amp;lt;10 cm-thick) occur in the Transition Zone and in the 

lowermost portion of the Mafic Zone. Thin chromitites hosted by noritic rocks are 

commonly preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite, These chromitites are fine- to 

medium-grained chromite cumulates with intercumulus plagioclase and orthopyroxene 

The upward transition from massive chromitite, to chain textured chromitite and 

disseminated chromite is common and provides a facing criterion for the igneous 

stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 1.5F).  

1.4.1.3 – Mafic Zone 
 

The Mafic Zone, about 5 km long and up to 3 km wide, comprises an up to 2000 

meters-thick (Fig. 1.3C) sequence of monotonous noritic rocks (i.e., orthopyroxene and 

plagioclase cumulates). Minor interlayered ultramafic rocks in the Mafic Zone consist 

mainly of orthopyroxenite (Fig. 1.3C). These rocks are similar to those described in the 

Transition Zone. Medium-grained norite consisting of tabular plagioclase and anhedral

orthopyroxene is the characteristic rock type of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 1.5G). These rocks 

are adcumulates except for rare domains with interstitial quartz and/or clinopyroxene 

 

1.4.1.4 – Sulfide Zone 
 

 Several PGE-mineralized intervals occur in the Transtion Zone but the Sulfide 

Zone hosts the bulk of the PGE resources in the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., 

2007). A detailed description of the PGE deposit is being developed (Mansur et al., in 

prep.) and just a brief description of the Sulfide Zone is provided in here. The Sulfide 

Zone consists of a 10 – 50 meters thick interval with disseminated sulfides located at the 

contact of the Ultramafic and Transition zones (Figs. 1.3A, 1.3B and 1.4A). This 

stratabound PGE mineralization consists of disseminated sulfides (~ 1-3 vol. %) hosted 

mainly by orthopyroxenite. Base metal sulfides (pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; 

chalcopyrite) interstitial to cumulus silicates or their pseudomorphs characterize the 

Sulfide Zone. PGE contents in the Sulfide Zone have strong positive correlation with 

modal sulfides. Pt+Pd contents are highly variable in the mineralized interval, from a 

few ppb up to several ppm, have positive correlation with copper and sulfur contents, 

and show consistent Pt/Pd ratios of about 0.7 (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur et al., 

in prep.). In addition to PGE associated with disseminated sulfides in the Sulfide Zone, 

distinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd &gt; 1 ppm) occur in sulfide-poor intervals in the 

Transition Zone. These unusual sulfide-poor PGE mineralizations are similar to those 

described in the Serra da Onça Complex (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and in the footwall 

zone of the Santa Rita deposit in the Mirabela Complex (Ferreira Filho et. al., 2013). 

 

1.4.1.5 – Metamorphism 
 

 Metamorphic assemblages commonly replace primary igneous minerals of the 

Luanga Complex. This metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous and characterized by an 

extensive hydration that largely preserves primary textures, bulk rock compositions and 

the compositional domains of igneous minerals. The penetrative fabric is restricted to 

narrow domains of up to a few meters across, and igneous textures are identified in 

adjacent nondeformed domains. These assemblages include serpentine + talc + 

magnetite ± cummingtonite in replaced olivine-bearing ultramafic rocks, talc + 

serpentine + magnetite ± cummingtonite in replaced orthopyroxenites, and hornblende + 

chlorite + epidote in replaced mafic rocks. Metamorphic assemblages indicate 

temperatures up to the amphibolite facies of metamorphism in the Luanga (Ferreira 



 

23 
 

Filho et al., 2007) and Lago Grande Complexes (Teixeira et al., 2015). The age and type 

of metamorphism affecting the layered intrusions and their host metavolcanic and 

metasedimentary rocks in the Serra Leste region is a debated issue (Dardenne et al., 

1988; Suita, 1988; Teixeira et al., 2015; Tavares, 2015) and will not be addressed in this 

study. However, the effect of metamorphism on sulfides is relevant for discussions 

regarding PGE mineralizations hosted by sulfide-bearing and sulfide-poor cumulate 

rocks in the Luanga Complex. The metamorphic alteration is heterogeneous as indicated 

by rocks with magmatic minerals and texture closely associated (i.e., a few to dozen of 

meters apart in drill core) with rocks where primary textures are preserved but 

magmatic minerals are extensively replaced. Apart from highly variable hydration, the 

compositions of variably altered samples are very similar when recalculated on 

anhydrous basis, thus supporting that metamorphic alteration does not promote a 

significant change in composition. 

 

1.4.2 – Mineral Chemistry  
 

 Systematic studies of mineral chemistry of cumulus minerals from the Luanga 

Complex (i.e., olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase) were performed in samples 

collected in a representative section along the central and northern parts of the complex 

(Fig. 1.3A). This composed section comprises drill core samples collected from 

boreholes intersecting the Ultramafic Zone (LUFD-143, LUFD-141 and LUFD-69), 

Transition Zone (LUFD-69, LUFD-71, LUFD-77, LUFD-78 and LUFD-79) and Mafic 

Zone (LUFD-105, LUFD-104 and LUFD-93), together with samples from outcrops of 

the Mafic Zone (see Fig. 1.3A for the location of boreholes and outcrops). Based on 

detailed sampling (~ 140 samples) and petrographic studies, 10 samples with olivine, 19 

samples with orthopyroxene and 27 samples with plagioclase were chosen for chemical 

analyses. Olivine was analysed in samples of serpentinite and harzburgite from the 

Ultramafic and Transition zones, respectively. Orthopyroxene was analysed in samples 

of orthopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite from the Transition Zone. Plagioclase was 

analysed in samples of norite from the Transition and Mafic zones. Compositional 

variation of olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase with stratigraphy in the Luanga 

Complex is shown in figure 1.6.  



 

24 
 

 

 

 

 

Olivine compositions range from Fo78.8 to Fo86.7 mol% (Fig. 1.6) indicating 

moderately primitive compositions. A systematic evaluation of cryptic variation of 

olivine is hampered by the restricted distribution of unaltered crystals throughout the 

Ultramafic and Transition zones. Nevertheless, our results indicate that higher Fo 

contents occur in harzburgites of the upper portion of the Transition Zone (Fig. 1.6). Ni 

contents in olivine from the Ultramafic Zone range from 2800 to 3700 ppm and are 

positively correlated with Fo contents (Fig. 1.7A). Ni contents in olivine crystals from 

the Transition Zone range from 4500 to 7400 ppm and are weakly correlated with Fo 

contents (Fig. 1.7A). Considering the Fo range, the contents of Ni in the Luanga 

Complex, especially in the Transition Zone, are distinctively high.  

Orthopyroxene compositions range from En77.0 to En89.9 mol% in the Transition 

Zone. The cryptic variation of orthopyroxene shows many reversals within a consistent 

upward increase in En contents, suggesting an inverse fractionation in the Transition 

Zone (Fig. 1.6). This trend is consistent with olivine compositions and indicates 

Fig. 1.6:  Compositional variations of cumulus minerals throughout the stratigraphy of the 

Luanga Complex.  



 

25 
 

progressively more primitive compositions (i.e., higher Mg/Mg+Fe ratios) toward de 

upper portions of the Transition Zone. Ni contents in orthopyroxene range from 800 to 

1700 ppm with weak positive correlation with En contents (Fig. 1.7B). Ni contents in 

orthopyroxene of the Transition Zone are distinctively high and consistent with elevated 

values reported for olivine.  

Plagioclase compositions range from An83.2 to An57.3 mol% in the Mafic Zone 

and the upper portion of the Transition Zone. The cryptic variation of plagioclase shows 

several reversals within a consistent upward decrease in An contents, suggesting a 

normal fractionation in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 1.6). Plagioclase compositions in the 

Transition Zone, range from An74.28 to An78.61 indicating An contents lower than those 

reported in the lower portion of the Mafic Zone.

enstatite contents for orthopyroxene crystals. 



 

26 
 

In summary, cryptic variations shown in figure 1.6 indicate an inverse 

fractionation trend in the Transition Zone, followed by a normal fractionation trend in 

the Mafic Zone. These broad compositional trends include several reversals throughout 

the stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex, thus suggesting a magmatic evolution in a 

dynamic open system magma chamber, a subject to be considered in the following 

discussions.  

1.4.3 -  Bulk rock geochemistry 
 

 A group of 21 samples representative of the stratigraphy of the Luanga 

Complex, comprising 3 samples from the Ultramafic Zone, 11 samples from the 

Transition Zone and 7 samples from the Mafic Zone, was analysed for major, minor and 

trace elements (see Table 1.1 and Online Supplementary Table 2). Variable amounts of 

loss on ignition reflect the degree of alteration and/or different alteration minerals for 

distinct rock types. Hence, the compositions of major and minor elements are 

normalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis. The reasoning for normalizing on 

anhydrous basis is to equilibrate differences originated by various degrees of hydration, 

especially when olivine cumulates (i.e., 6 to 11 wt.% LOI) are compared with 

orthopyroxene or orthopyroxene-plagioclase cumulates (i.e., 1 to 5 wt.% LOI).  

 

1.4.3.1 – Major and minor elements 
 

 Because the Luanga Complex consists of cumulate rocks, their major and trace 

element compositions are controlled by the type of cumulus minerals. The plot of MgO 

vs major element oxides (Fig. 1.8A-F) is consistent with the predominance of olivine, 

orthopyroxene and plagioclase cumulates, as indicated by petrographic studies. This 

suggestion is supported by comparing major element compositions with the 

composition of cumulus minerals obtained in this study (Fig. 1.8A-F).  

 Rocks with olivine as cumulus mineral (i.e., serpentinite and harzburgite) have 

MgO content (normalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis) between 26.05 to 43.17 

wt.%. These highly variable values are consistent with distinctively different 

proportions of intercumulus minerals in these rocks, as indicated by samples with 

adcumulate to orthocumulate textures. The contents of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and 

K2O of these rocks are not controlled just by different proportions of olivine and 

orthopyroxene (Fig. 1.8A-F). Compositions plotting outside the Ol-Opx tie lines have

Luanga Complex. I: Plot of Al2O3 versus CaO for rocks of the Luanga Complex. Data from 

Table 1 normalized to 100% on an anhydrous basis. Compositions of olivine, orthopyroxene and 

plagioclase correspond to microprobe analyses reported in this study, whereas the composition of 

clinopyroxene are from gabbroic rocks of the Serra da Onça Complex (Rosa, 2014).  



 

28 
 

intercumulus plagioclase, resulting in relatively lower SiO2 content and higher CaO and 

Al2O3 contents. The contents of Ni and Cr are controlled by olivine and chromite, 

respectively (Fig. 1.8G-H). Values of Ni and Cr are compatible with Ni content in 

olivine (~ 3000-6000 ppm of Ni in rocks with approximately 40-50 vol. % olivine) and 

the presence of chromite as an accessory mineral (~ 1-2 vol.%), respectively. Very low 

sulfur contents in these rocks (S &amp;lt;0.04 wt.%) are consistent with the lack of sulfide 

minerals and Ni contents being controlled mainly by olivine.  

 Orthopyroxenites have MgO content (normalized to 100% on an anhydrous 

basis) between 24.52 and 28.25 wt.%, consistent with rocks composed mainly of 

cumulus orthopyroxene and minor amounts of intercumulus plagioclase. The contents 

of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and Fe2O3 of these rocks are restricted to compositions 

plotted along the Opx-Pl tie lines (Fig. 1.8A-F). Cr contents (up to 3500 ppm) are 

essentially the same of the olivine-bearing samples, attesting that Cr is also controlled 

by accessory chromite in orthopyroxenites. Ni contents are lower than in olivine-bearing 

rocks (up to 1500 ppm) due to lower Ni content in orthopyroxene (up to 1600 ppm) 

compared to olivine. 

 Norite is the lithotype with the lowest MgO content (from 7.52 to 11.59 wt.%) of 

the Luanga Complex. The compositions of norites from the Transition and Mafic zones 

are very similar (Fig. 1.8A-F) with contents of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O and Fe2O3 

restricted to the plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie line (Fig. 1.8A-F), as expected for 

plagioclase-orthopyroxene adcumulates. Nevertheless, contents of K2O above and Na2O 

bellow the plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie line may result from minor alteration and/or 

accessory phlogopite (Fig. 1.8E-F). Cr and Ni contents decrease with decreasing MgO 

contents as the result of progressive disappearance of chromite and reduction of Ni and 

Cr contents in orthopyroxene with fractionation (Fig 1.8G-H). Cr contents of up to 1880 

ppm are consistent with the common presence of chromite as a liquidus mineral in 

norites of the Transition Zone. 

 Primary pyroxenes are not preserved throughout most of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 

1.8E-F). While extensive petrographic data indicate that norite is the only mafic rock 

type in the Transition Zone, direct petrographic evidence is not available for the 

extensively replaced rocks of the Mafic Zone, This raises the possibility that 

fractionation in the Luanga Complex led to the crystallization of clinopyroxene as a 

liquidus mineral in the upper portion of the Mafic Zone, such that the crystallization 



 

29 
 

sequence evolved from Opx+Pl cumulates to Opx+Cpx+Pl cumulates, as described in 

several layered intrusions. The plot of CaO vs Al2O3, comparing bulk rock and mineral 

compositions (Fig. 1.8I), indicate that plagioclase and orthopyroxene adcumulates 

prevail in the Mafic Zone. Sample LUFD-120B, a coarse-grained gabbroic rock 

collected from an elongated 1-2 meters long pegmatoidal pod has a composition 

consistent with a gabbronorite (Fig. 1.8I). This sample has the lowest MgO, Ni and Cr 

contents (Fig. 1.8G-H) and is interpreted as resulting from crystallization of trapped 

intercumulus liquid. 

 

1.4.3.2 – Trace elements 
 

Mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Luanga Complex have relatively low contents of 

incompatible trace elements (Table 1.1), as expected for olivine, pyroxene and 

plagioclase cumulates. Variations in contents of incompatible trace elements in mafic-

ultramafic cumulates in layered complexes result from the combined effect of variable 

assemblages of cumulus minerals, fractionation of the parental magma and variable 

amounts of trapped intercumulus liquid (e.g., Barnes, 1986; Ferreira Filho et al., 1998). 

Distinct primitive mantle-normalized rare earth element (REE) profiles characterize 

different cumulate rocks of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 1.9). REE profiles for 

serpentinites (i.e., olivine cumulates) have flat to slightly positive slope for LREE and 

flat slope for HREE (Fig. 1.9A). Sample LUFD-141-39, an extensively replaced 

serpentinite (11.57 wt.% LOI) with adcumulate texture, has the lowest contents of REE 

(Fig. 1.9A). This sample has an irregular REE profile with distinct negative Eu 

anomaly, likely to result from alteration or due to larger analytical errors in samples 

close to the detection limits of the analytical methods. REE patterns for samples of 

orthopyroxenite (Fig. 1.9B) have positive slope for LREE and slightly negative slope 

for HREE. The contents of LREE and primitive mantle normalized La/Sm ratios 

(La/Sm MN) of orthopyroxenites increase with the amount of intercumulus plagioclase. 

Samples with intercumulus plagioclase also have positive Eu anomalies, while an 

adcumulate orthopyroxenite (sample LUFD-69-115.64) has negative Eu anomaly (Fig. 

1.9B). REE patterns for harzburgite have slightly positive slope for LREE, flat to 

slightly negative slope for HREE and weak negative Eu anomalies (Fig. 1.9C). These 

samples have the lowest LREE contents for the Luanga Complex. Norite from the 

Transition and Mafic zones has distinctively positive slopes for LREE, flat slopes for 



 

30 
 

HREE and distinctively positive Eu anomalies (Figs. 1.9D-E), as expected for rocks 

with abundant plagioclase. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Contents for several incompatible high field strength elements (e.g., Ta, Nb, Th, 

Hf) in ultramafic rocks of the Luanga Complex are close to their lower limits of 

quantification in the analyses of this study (Table 1.1), and should be considered with 

discretion. In addition, contents for several LILE (large ion lithophile elements) are 

variable due to the effect of metamorphic alteration. In order to prevent scattering 

associated with alteration or analytical uncertainties, mantle normalized trace elements

patterns were plot for alteration-resistant trace elements on norite samples, which have 

the highest trace elements content (Fig. 1.10). The mantle-normalized alteration-

resistant trace element patterns for norite samples are fractionated, as indicated by 

relative enrichment in LREE and Th, with strong negative Nb and Ta anomalies (Fig. 

1.10). 

 

 

 

 

 

1.5 – Discussion 
 

1.5.1 – Magmatic structure  
 

 Ni-Cu-PGE deposits in mafic-ultramafic intrusion are broadly classified into 

those associated with magma conduits (or chonoliths) and those associated with layered 

intrusions (Beresford and Hronsky, 2014). Ore-hosting intrusions come in widely 

variable architectures and sizes as the result of highly complex mechanisms of mantle 

magma transport and storage in the crust (Barnes et al., 2016). Although typical tube-

like conduits (e.g., Limoeiro, Mota-e-Silva et al., 2013; Nebo-Babel, Seat et al., 2007) 

have very distinct architecture compared with classical layered intrusions (e.g., 

Skaergaard, Irvine, 1987; Niquelandia, Ferreira Filho et al., 1992 and 2010), they are 

just members of a wide range of structures resulting from variable and usually 

continuous magmatic processes. The main features of the architecture of the Luanga 

Complex are listed below to provide the framework for the following discussion on the 

compositional variations through the intrusion.

norite from the Mafic Zone of the Luanga Complex. Data from Table 1 and Supplentary Table 2. 

Lower and Upper Crust values are from Wedepohl (1995). Primitive mantle normalization 

values are from Sun and McDonough (1989). 

 



 

32 
 

a) The morphology is broadly an arc-shaped structure with a thicker central portion that 

becomes thinner toward the edges. 

b) Layering in variable scales (from a few centimeters to a few hundred meters thick) is 

the most characteristic structure. 

c) Cyclic units occur in all zones of the Luanga Complex and are abundant in the TZ. 

 The features mentioned above are characteristic of layered intrusions originated 

in open-system magma chambers through successive influxes of magma. 

 

1.5.2 – Compositional variations through the Luanga Complex  
 

 Geochemical results described in this study provide constraints for the magmatic 

fractionation of the Luanga Complex. The schematic model in figure 1.11 summarizes 

these features. The Ultramafic Zone (Fig. 1.11; Stage 1) at the base of the layered 

sequence results from initial inputs of magma into the chamber. Cryptic variation of 

olivine in the Ultramafic Zone indicates a narrow compositional range (Fo 79.3 to 84.9) 

and moderately primitive compositions. The restricted compositional range within the 

monotonous sequence of olivine and chromite cumulates of the Ultramafic Zone 

suggests open-system crystallization involving periodic replenishment by new primitive 

magma pulses (Fig. 1.11; Stage 1). Fractionation following the replenishment of the 

magma chamber is limited, such that the evolving magma does not usually depart from 

the field where olivine and chromite are liquidus minerals. The contact of the 

Ultramafic and Transition zones is marked by the change from a monotonous to a 

highly variable sequence of rock types, the later interpreted as a sequence of cyclic 

units. Cryptic variation of orthopyroxene in the Transition Zone (Fig. 1.6) indicates 

several reversals within a major upward trend of progressively more primitive 

compositions. From bottom upwards this reversed fractionation consists of several 

normal fractionating cyclic units of variable thickness, which are indicated by individual 

cycles consisting of a complete sequence of harzburgite, orthopyroxenite and norite, or 

an incomplete sequence (usually orthopyroxenite-norite or harzburgite-

orthopyroxenite). Chromitite layers or seams commonly occur at the base of cyclic units 

as reported in several layered intrusions (e.g., Bushveld Complex, Naldrett et al., 2012; 

Great Dyke, Wilson, 1982), or immediately (~ 10 centimeters) above the most primitive 

rock type of a new cycle. Cryptic variation of olivine in the Transition Zone indicates a 

larger compositional range (Fo 78.8 to 86.7) compared to the Ultramafic Zone. Results 



 

33 
 

indicate that the most primitive olivine in the Luanga Complex occurs at the upper 

portion of the Transition Zone, which is consistent with cryptic variation of 

orthopyroxene (Fig. 1. 6). The compositional variation of orthopyroxene and olivine in 

the Transition Zone suggests and open-system crystallization involving periodic 

replenishment by new primitive magma pulses followed by significant fractionation 

(Fig. 1.11; Stage 2). To explain the reversed fractionation of the Transition Zone, the 

residual magma resident in the magma chamber after fractionation should become 

progressively more primitive. This upward trend of progressively more primitive 

compositions may result either from an input of progressively more primitive parental 

magma, or a progressive increase in the amount of the same parental magma. Despite 

the fact that the Mafic Zone consists mainly of a monotonous sequence of 

orthopyroxene and plagioclase adcumulates, cryptic variation of plagioclase along the 

Mafic Zone indicates multiple reversals within an upward fractionation trend (Fig. 1.6). 

These reversals indicate several new influxes of fresh magma followed by fractionation, 

such that the evolving magma does not usually depart from the field where plagioclase 

and orthopyroxene are liquidus minerals (Fig. 1.11; Stage 3). 

 Cryptic variation and the crystallization sequence along the stratigraphy of the 

Luanga Complex (Fig. 1.11) are characteristic of layered intrusions originated in highly 

dynamic open-system magma chambers, a common feature in PGE-mineralized 

intrusions.  

1.5.3 –Constraints on the composition of the parental melt 
 

 The characterization of parental magmas in layered complexes is a key feature to 

understand the nature of mantle source, the amount of assimilation of crustal rocks 

during ascent and emplacement and their potential to host economic deposits. The 

composition of the parental magma of the Luanga Complex cannot be constrained by 

common approaches used to define their composition in well-exposed intrusions with 

primary composition and magmatic architecture largely preserved (e.g., chilled margin,  

 



 

34 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

bulk composition, extrusive equivalents, related dykes). Once a direct composition of 

parental magma is not available, its nature can be inferred from the crystallization 

sequence and cumulate geochemistry. The compositional range of cumulus olivine 

within the Ultramafic and Transition zones of the Luanga Complex (Fo78.9-86.4) is 

comparable to those reported for the central zone of the Jinchuan intrusion (Fo83-86; Li et 

al., 2004) and the Ultramafic Zone of the Lago Grande Complex (Fo80.0-84.7; Teixeira et 

al., 2015). This range of olivine compositions is typical of layered intrusions originated 

from moderate primitive parental magmas, as suggested by the MgO and FeO 

compositions of 11.5 wt.% and 11.2 wt.% respectively, estimated by Chai and Naldrett 

(1992) for the parental magma of the Jinchuan Complex.  

The crystallization sequence of the Luanga Complex is similar to those of the 

major PGE-bearing intrusions (e.g., Bushveld, Stillwater, Great Dyke) in which 

orthopyroxene precedes clinopyroxene (Eales and Cawthorn, 1996). In fact, cumulus 

clinopyroxene does not occur in the Luanga Complex. The early crystallization of 

orthopyroxene indicates that the primary magma was silica saturated, a feature 

commonly interpreted as the result of crustal assimilation (Campbell, 1985).  

Mantle-normalized trace element profiles for norites of the Luanga Complex 

show characteristic negative Nb and Ta anomalies with relative enrichment in LREE 

Fig. 1.11: Schematic model illustrating the evolution of the Luanga Complex. See text for 

explanation. Mineral abbreviations: (Ol) olivine, (Opx) orthopyroxene and (Plg) plagioclase. 

 



 

35 
 

and Th (Fig. 1.10). A comparison between alteration-resistant mantle-normalized trace 

elements of lower and upper crust and norites of the Luanga Complex shows similar 

profiles (Fig. 1.10), which may be interpreted as the result of crustal assimilation during 

ascent and/or emplacement of the parental magma. The trace element profiles for 

gabbroic rocks of the Luanga (Fig. 1.10) and Lago Grande complexes (Teixeira et al., 

2015) show the same pattern, characterized by negative Nb and Ta anomalies with 

relative enrichment in LREE and Th. Additional evidence for crustal contamination of 

the parental magma of the Lago Grande Complex is provided by Nd model ages 

between 2.94 and 3.56 Ga, with variably negative ?Nd (T .= 2.72 Ga) values (Teixeira et al., 

2015). Together with the crystallization sequence, geochemical results obtained for 

layered intrusions of the Serra Leste region, are consistent with original mantle melts 

contaminated with older continental crust. This interpretation is consistent with the 

emplacement of layered intrusions within gneisses and migmatites of the Xingu 

Complex (ca. 3.0 Ga). Although the distribution of alteration-resistant elements in the 

Luanga Complex is consistent with contamination of a primitive mantle melt with 

continental crust, lithogeochemical data from the Luanga Complex may also be 

interpreted as the result of melting an old lithospheric mantle (Zhang et al., 2008). 

1.5.4 - Reasons for high nickel contents in olivine and orthopyroxene 
 

 Compared with most layered intrusions, olivine from ultramafic rocks of the 

Luanga Complex has significantly higher Ni content (Fig. 1.12). In fact, when similar 

Fo contents are considered, Ni contents in the Luanga Complex stand among the highest 

values ever reported in layered intrusions. The values reported in this study are much 

higher than content in olivine with variable Fo contents (Fo70.7 to Fo91.5) of the Bushveld 

Complex (Fig. 1.12A), including Ni-rich olivine from the Sandsloot section located 

below the Platreef (Yudovskaya et al, 2013). The similar high Ni contents in the range 

of 4,000-14,000 ppm for Fo contents of 77.9-90.6 was reported in olivine from the Ni-

PGE sulfide lensoid orebodies of the Kevitsa intrusion (Yang et al., 2013).  

 Possible reasons for high Ni contents in olivine and orthopyroxene include their 

crystallization from anomalously Ni-rich magmas or their upgrade through interaction 

with closely associated sulfide liquids (i.e., diffusion of Ni from sulfide liquid to 

silicates) or sulfides (i.e., solid state diffusion of Ni from sulfides to silicates). The later 

may be ruled out as an explanation for the Ni enrichment in olivine and orthopyroxene 

crystals in rocks of the Luanga Complex, as high contents occur mainly in rocks with no 

associated sulfides. In fact, the Ni content of olivine crystals within the Sulfide Zone (Ni 



 

36 
 

contents in the range of 3700 to 5900 ppm) is the same or even lower than Ni content of 

olivine crystals from outside this zone (Ni contents in the range of 2800 to 7400 ppm). 

Furthermore, although minor Ni enrichment in zoned olivine crystals closely associated 

with sulfides was reported in a few Ni-Cu deposits (e.g., Voisey's Bay: Li and Naldrett, 

1999; Santa Rita: Barnes et al., 2013), olivine crystals closely associated with sulfides 

are not Ni-enriched in the majority of deposits.  

 Possible mechanisms for Ni-enrichment of the parental magma include the 

generation of magmas from pyroxenitic mantle sources (Sobolev et al., 2005; 2007), or 

the upgrading of magmas through dissolution of previously formed Ni-rich sulfide melts 

(Kerr and Leitch, 2005). These two alternative mechanisms to generate unusually Ni-

rich magmas will be considered for the Luanga Complex. 

 The Ni contents in olivine in equilibrium with primary magma from peridotite 

mantle should not contain more than 3,200 ppm Ni (Herzberg, 2011). On the other 

hand, magmas derived from pyroxenitic sources are expected to have higher Ni contents 

(up to a factor of 2) such that olivine in equilibrium with these magmas is expected to 

have proportionally higher Ni contents (Sobolev et al., 2007; Herzberg, 2011). Sobolev 

et al. (2007) used a large data set of high-precision analyses of olivine phenocrysts from 

different tectonic settings to conclude that a pyroxenitic mantle source is a major 

contributor to tholeiitic (silica-saturated) and transitional (moderately silica-

undersaturated) magmas of ocean island basalts and large igneous provinces emplaced 

on thick oceanic or continental lithosphere. The authors' data set indicates that most 

olivine crystals from these magma types are significantly enriched in Ni and depleted in 

Mn. This mechanism was recently considered as an explanation for the high Ni contents 

of olivine crystals in the mafic-ultramafic intrusion associated with the Santa Rita Ni-

Cu-PGE sulfide deposit in Brazil (Fig. 1.12B, Barnes et al., 2013). The highest Ni 

contents in olivine of the Luanga Complex occur in distinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd 

&gt; 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, while olivine in the Ultramafic Zone have 

lower Ni (Fig. 1.7A) and PGE contents (Pt+Pd usually &amp;lt;LDL= 80 ppb).

 The association of high Ni contents in olivine with high PGE contents in both 

sulfide-poor and sulfide-rich intervals is characteristic of the Transition Zone. Because 

the distribution of PGE during melting of pyroxenitic sources are not well constrained 

by experimental data, the interpretation for higher Ni contents in olivine crystals due to 

a pyroxenitic mantle source indicated by Sobolev et al. (2007) does not necessarily 

provide an explanation for the high PGE contents in the Luanga Complex. Nevertheless, 

Barnes et al. (2016) noticed that the basaltic crustal component most likely to provide 

the raw material for deep mantle pyroxenite and eclogite, would be expected to be 

impoverished in PGE compared with the peridotitic mantle. The authors conclude that 

melts associated with pyroxenitic sources should be PGE-depleted compared to those 

derived mainly from peridotitic sources. 

 The Kerr and Leitch (2005) model of partial dissolution of early formed 

magmatic sulfides by new fresh inputs of fresh magmas, known as "multistage-

dissolution upgrading model", provides a possible explanation to some extremely PGE-

rich sulfides. Although the authors' model was mainly applied for the origin of high 

tenor sulfide liquids, the concept that preexisting sulfide liquid could be partly dissolved 

by later batches of magma, suggests that this process could also proceed to the sulfide 

liquid be entirely dissolved and previously extracted metals returned to later batches of 

silicate magma (Kerr and Leitch, 2005). This process that may lead to the origin of 

metal enriched magmas was proposed to explain the origin of extremely Ni-rich olivine 

associated with Ni-PGE orebodies in the Kevitsa intrusion (Yang et al., 2013). The 

suggested "cannibalization" of proto-sulfide ore model, applied for the Kevitsa PGE-

rich magma, may also justify the association of high Ni contents in olivine with high 

PGE contents in both sulfide-poor and sulfide-rich rocks in the Luanga Complex. 

 

1.5.5 – Tectonic setting of the PGE-mineralized magmatism in the Carajás Mineral 

Province  
 

 The ages of the layered intrusions of the Carajás Mineral Province (2763 ± 6 Ma 

Luanga Complex: Machado et al., 1991; 2766 ± 6 Ma Serra da Onça Complex: Lafon et 

al., 2000) overlap with ages of bimodal volcanism in the Grão Pará Group (2759 ± 2 

Ma: Machado et al., 1991; 2760 ± 11 Ma: Trendall et al., 1998), supporting the 

interpretation that mafic volcanics and mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions resulted from 

coeval major magmatic events in the Carajás region (Machado et al., 1991; Ferreira 

Filho et al., 2007). The extensive basaltic volcanism is considered to result either from 



 

39 
 

intra-plate rifting of older continental crust (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1986; Olszewski et al., 

1989; Villas and Santos, 2001) or from subduction-related settings (Dardenne et al., 

1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994; Zucchetti, 2007). The basaltic volcanism in the 

Carajás Domain shows lithogeochemical and isotopic evidence for significant 

contamination of mantle-derived melts by continental crust, thus supporting the 

continental rifting model (Gibbs et al., 1986; Olszewski et al., 1989). The structure and 

composition of the layered intrusions of the Carajás are also consistent with a 

Neoarchean intra-plate rifting environment in Carajás. Apart from contentious 

discussions regarding the tectonic setting of the Carajás Mineral Province, we use 

results obtained in this study to evaluate the petro-tectonic setting of the PGE-

mineralized magmatism in Carajás. 

 The cluster of PGE-mineralized intrusions in the eastern portion of the Carajás 

Mineral Province was identified during regional exploration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). 

Mineralized intrusions have similar fractionation sequences, comparable petrological 

evolution, overlapped U-Pb zircon ages and similar styles of PGE mineralization, 

supporting the interpretation that they belong to the same magmatic suite (Teixeira et 

al., 2015). Results obtained for the Lago Grande and Luanga complexes indicate that 

this magmatic suite originated from siliceous magnesian basaltic magmas, similar to the 

parental liquids of the world's principal PGE-sulfide deposits (Barnes and Lightfoot, 

2005). However, the unusually high contents of Ni obtained in olivine of the Luanga 

Complex do not occur in the Lago Grande Complex (Fig. 1.12C). Considering the 

petrological similarities of these complexes, the distinct Ni contents in olivine are a 

remarkable feature. Distinct Ni contents in olivine suggest that the process leading to Ni 

enrichment in the parental magma is restricted to the Luanga Complex in the Serra 

Leste suite. Because the most significant PGE-mineralized intersections with 

consistently high PGE tenors in the Serra Leste region occur in the Luanga Complex 

(Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur et al., in prep.), the same process should promote 

the enrichment in Ni and PGE in the parental magma. Regardless of the mechanism 

leading to enrichment of Ni and PGE, the high Ni content in olivine described in the 

Luanga Complex has implications for mineral exploration. Unusually high Ni contents 

in olivine and/or orthopyroxene may provide an additional exploration tool for Ni-PGE 

deposits. We have compared Ni content of olivine for several layered intrusions in the 

Carajás Mineral Province (Fig. 1.12C). Our data set includes data from complexes 

located in the Serra Leste region (Luanga and Lago Grande), the Canaã dos Carajás 

region (Vermelho and Touro), the Tucumã region (Serra do Onça and Serra do Puma) 



 

40 
 

and a few analyses for the Jacaré Complex located in the westernmost portion of the 

Carajás Mineral Province. All these intrusions have Ni contents in olivine compatible 

with values obtained in most layered complexes globally, except Luanga and Jacaré 

complexes  (Fig. 1.12A-B). Olivine in dunite and harzburgite of closely associated 

samples of the Jacaré Complex has very primitive composition (Fo contents range from 

89.8 to 92.7) and very high Ni content (4000 to 7000 ppm). The Jacaré Complex is a 

very large ultramafic intrusion (~ 100 Km
2
) best known for hosting large Ni laterite 

resources (Carlon et al., 2006). The magmatic structure and petrology of the Jacaré 

Complex have not been investigated in detail and olivine analyses are limited to a few 

samples. Nevertheless, preliminary data for olivine compositions are higher than most 

intrusions and may suggest a favorable potential for Ni-PGE mineralization.   

 

1.6 - Conclusions  

  

 Systematic geological and petrological characterization of the Luanga Complex 

provides additional evidences for a PGE-fertile magmatism at the eastern portion of the 

Carajás Mineral Province. Our results indicate that Ni contents in olivine in the Luanga 

Complex (up to 7,500 ppm) stand among the highest values reported in layered 

intrusions globally. High Ni contents in olivine of the Luanga Complex occur in 

distinctively PGE enriched (Pt+Pd &gt; 1 ppm) intervals of the Transition Zone, in both 

sulfide-poor and sulfide-rich rocks. The origin of the PGE- and Ni-rich parental magma 

of the Luanga Complex is likely to result from the “cannibalization” of previously 

formed sulfides (Kerr and Leitch, 2005). Regardless of the process that lead to the 

generation of anomalously Ni- and PGE-rich magmas, our results indicate that an 

anomalous PGE-fertile magmatism took place at the eastern portion of the Carajás 

Mineral Province, thus triggering the development of different styles of PGE 

mineralization.

Abstract 
 

The Neoarchean (ca. 2.75 Ga) Luanga Complex, located in the Carajás Mineral 

Province in Brazil, is a medium-size layered intrusion consisting, from base to top, of 

ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone), interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulates 

(Transition Zone) and mafic cumulates (Mafic Zone). Chromitite layers in the Luanga 

Complex occur in the upper portion of interlayered harzburgite and orthopyroxenite of 

the Transition Zone and associated with the lowermost norites of the Mafic Zone. The 

stratigraphic interval that hosts chromitites (~ 150 meters thick) consists of several 

cyclic units interpreted as the result of successive influxes of primitive parental magma. 

The compositions of chromite in chromitites from the Transition Zone (Lower Group 

Chromitites) have distinctively higher Cr# (100Cr/(Cr+Al+Fe3+)) compared with 

chromite in chromitites from the Mafic Zone (Upper Group Chromitites). Chromitites 

hosted by noritic rocks are preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite located 15-20 cm 

below each chromitite layer. Lower Cr# in chromitites hosted by noritic rocks are 

interpreted as the result of increased Al2O3 activity caused by new magma influxes. 

Electron microprobe analyses on line transverses through 35 chromite crystals indicate 

that they are rimmed and/or extensively zoned. The composition of chromite in 

chromitites changes abruptly in the outer rim, becoming enriched in Fe3+ and Fe2+ at 

the expense of Mg, Cr, Al, thus moving toward the magnetite apex on the spinel prism. 

This outer rim, characterized by higher reflectance, is probably related to the 

metamorphic replacement of the primary mineralogy of the Luanga Complex. Zoned 

chromite crystals indicate an extensive exchange between divalent (Mg, Fe2+) cations 



 

52 
 

and minor to none exchange between trivalent cations (Cr3+, Al3+ and Fe3+). This Mg-

Fe zoning is interpreted as the result of subsolidus exchange of Fe2+ and Mg between 

chromite and coexisting silicates during slow cooling of the intrusion. A remarkable 

feature of chromitites from Luanga Complex is the occurrence of abundant silicate 

inclusions within chromite crystals. These inclusions show an adjacent inner rim with 

higher Cr# and lower Mg# (100Mg/(Mg+Fe2+)) and Al# (100Al/(Cr+Al+Fe3+)). This 

compositional shift is possibly due to crystallization from a progressively more 

fractionated liquid trapped in the chromite crystal. Significant modification of primary 

cumulus composition of chromite, as indicated in our study for the Luanga Complex, is 

likely to be common in non-massive chromitites and the rule for disseminated chromites 

in mafic intrusions.

2.1 - Introduction  
 

 Cr-bearing spinels have been used as important petrogenetic indicators in many 

studies (e.g., Irvine, 1965; Stowe, 1994; Barnes and Roeder, 2001). The composition of 

chromite, a mineral relatively resistant to alteration that crystallizes over a wide range of 

mafic and ultramafic magmas, is particularly useful as an indicator of magmatic 

processes in rocks submitted to metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration. However, 

chromite is susceptible to significant post-magmatic modification, as indicated by 

several studies of chromite in komatiites (e.g., Barnes, 2000) and ophiolitic complexes 

(e.g., Evans and Frost, 1975; Gole and Hill, 1990). Primary chromite compositions 

inherited from the magma may also be modified due to reaction with intercumulus 

liquid or subsolidus reaction with silicates (e.g., Barnes and Roeder, 2001; Barnes, 

1998). Mass balance arguments are commonly used to indicate that massive chromitites 

with &gt; 70 % vol. chromite are likely to preserve its original igneous compositions 

because there are few other phases available for element exchange (e.g., Eales and 

Reynolds, 1986). This reasoning was successfully used in several studies of chromitites 

(e.g., Bacuri Complex, Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Ipueira-Medrado Sill, Marques 

and Ferreira Filho, 2003; Nuasahi and Sukinda Massifs, Mondal et al., 2006). However, 

apart from massive chromitites, post-magmatic modifications should be carefully 



 

53 
 

evaluated before using chromite compositions to indicate magma types, tectonic 

environments and magmatic fractionation. 

 This study, the first systematic description of chromitites throughout the 

stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex, provides an additional example of chromitites 

hosted by mafic cumulates. The stratigraphic distribution of chromitites and mineral 

composition data of chromite support previous results from host cumulate rocks 

suggesting that the Luanga layered intrusion originated in a dynamic open-system 

magma chamber (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Our results also indicate extensive 

modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite in chromitites of the Luanga 

Complex. We discuss this composition modification considering both late-magmatic 

and metamorphic processes. Our results indicate that the common use of chromite 

composition as a petrogenetic indicator for mafic intrusions should be considered with 

caution.  

 

2.2 - Regional setting 
 

2.2.1- The Carajás Mineral Province 
 

 The Carajás Mineral Province, located in the southeastern portion of the 

Amazonian Craton (Fig. 2.1A), is one of the most important mineral provinces of the 

South American continent, hosting several world-class Cu-Au and Ni deposits along 

with the largest iron resources of the world. The Carajás Mineral Province is subdivided 

in two Archean tectonic domains: the Rio Maria Domain to the south and the Carajás 

Domain to the north (Fig. 2.1B; Vasquez et al., 2008). A poorly defined zone 

characterized by regional EW faults, designated as the Transition Subdomain (Feio et 

al., 2013), separates these two domains.  

 The Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite–greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., 

2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual 

Mesoarchean (ca. 2.94 Ga) greenstone belts (Macambira and Lancelot, 1996; Souza et 

al., 2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone 

belt sequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016), 

suggests that the Andorinhas Supergroup extends further north than indicated in 

previous regional maps.

Geological map of the Carajás Mineral Province (modified from Vasquez et al., 2008). The dashed 

rectangle indicates the location of the Serra Leste magmatic suite. 



 

55 
 

The Archean basement of the Carajás Domain consists mainly of gneiss-

migmatite-granulite terrains, generally related to the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; 

Machado et al., 1991; Pidgeon et al., 2000). Different models have been proposed to 

explain the evolution of the Neoarchean volcano-sedimentary sequences, which include 

the large sequence of metabasalts of the Grão Pará Group (ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., 

1991; Vasquez et al., 2008) and associated banded iron formations. An intra-plate rift 

model is presented in several studies (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1986; Villas and Santos, 2001) 

but subduction-related environments have also been proposed (e.g., Dardenne et al., 

1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). These volcano-sedimentary sequences are covered by 

low-grade metamorphic sequences of clastic sedimentary rocks from the Águas Claras 

Formation (Araújo et al., 1988).  

Several mafic-ultramafic complexes intrude rocks of the Xingu Complex and the 

volcanic-sedimentary sequences in the Carajás Domain (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho 

et al., 2007). These intrusions host large Ni laterite deposits (e.g., Onça-Puma, 

Vermelho, Jacaré) as well as PGE deposits (e.g., Luanga, Lago Grande). Distinct 

magmatic structures and petrological evolution of the layered intrusions suggest that 

they include different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., Rosa, 2014; Siepierski, 2016; 

Teixeira et al., 2015).  

 

2.2.2 - The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite  

 

 The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster 

of small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern 

portion of the Carajás Mineral Province (Fig. 2.1). Mafic-ultramafic complexes are 

intrusive into gneiss and migmatites of the Xingu Complex and/or into volcano-

sedimentary rocks of the Grão Pará Group. This suite was originally grouped based on 

abundant PGE anomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding geological, 

stratigraphic or petrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). Systematic 

geological and petrological studies of the Lago Grande (Teixeira et al., 2015) and 

Luanga (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) Complexes provided the geological-

petrological framework of the Serra Leste Magmatic Suite described in here. 

 

 

 

 



 

56 
 

2.2.2.1 - Lago Grande Complex  

 

  The Lago Grande Complex is a NE-trending medium-size (12 km long and 

average 1.7 km wide) layered intrusion consisting mainly of mafic cumulate rocks 

(Mafic Zone) and minor ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone). Recent studies 

(Teixeira et al., 2015) indicate that igneous layers are overturned, such that the 

Ultramafic Zone overly the Mafic Zone. The Ultramafic Zone comprises an up to 250 m 

thick sequence of interlayered harzburgite and orthopyroxenite at the base and 

orthopyroxenite at the top. The Mafic Zone consists of an up to 1000 m thick 

monotonous sequence of gabbroic rocks. Primary igneous minerals are partially 

replaced by metamorphic assemblages that indicate temperatures up to the amphibolite 

facies of metamorphism. This metamorphic replacement is heterogeneous and 

characterized by an extensive hydration of primary minerals that largely preserves 

magmatic textures and bulk chemical composition. PGE mineralizations occur in 

chromitites (up to 10 ppm) and associated with base metal sulfides in the Ultramafic 

Zone (Teixeira et al., 2015).  

 

2.2.2 Luanga Complex 
 

 The Luanga Complex is a 6 km long and up to 3.5 km wide layered intrusion 

(Fig. 2.2) consisting, from base to top, of ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone), an 

intercalation of ultramafic and mafic cumulates (Transition Zone), and mafic cumulates 

(Mafic Zone). Similar to the configuration of the Lago Grande Complex, the Ultramafic 

Zone overlies the Transition Zone, which overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that 

the layered sequence in the Luanga Complex is also tectonically overturned (Fig. 2.2B; 

Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The Ultramafic Zone comprises an up to 800 m thick 

sequence of serpentinite (i.e., metamorphosed peridotite) with thin (&amp;lt;10 m thick) 

interlayered orthopyroxenite lenses. The Transition Zone consists of an up to 800 m 

thick pile of interlayered ultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks. Interlayering of variably 

textured orthopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite (Fig. 2.2C) in different scales (from 

few centimeters up to hundreds of meters thick) is a remarkable feature of the Transition 

Zone. Interlayering and reversals in cryptic variation of orthopyroxene and olivine in 

the Transition Zone (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) support an open and dynamic 

magmatic system. The Mafic Zone consists of an up to 2000 m thick sequence of  



 

57 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monotonous norite and minor interlayered orthopyroxenite (Fig. 2.2C). Chromitite 

layers with variable thickness (from few centimeters up to 0.6 m thick) and textures 

(Fig. 2.3) occur mainly in the upper portions of the Transition Zone and the lowermost 

Fig. 2.2: A) Geological map of the Luanga Complex (partially modified from unpublished report of 

VALE). Note the location of drill hole LUFD-079 referred to in this study. B) Geological section on 

the central portion of the complex (partially modified from Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). C) 

Representative stratigraphic column for the Luanga Complex (partially modified from Mansur and 

Ferreira Filho, 2016). Note the variation of cumulus minerals through the stratigraphy 



 

58 
 

portion of the Mafic Zone. Chromitites are better preserved in the central portion of the 

complex, where primary igneous textures and/or minerals prevail, becoming 

tectonically disturbed on its southern and northern limits (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 

2016). PGE mineralizations occur associated with base metal sulfides in the contact 

zone of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones and associated with chromitite layers in the 

Transition Zone (Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007).  

 

2.3 - Sampling and analytical procedures 
 

For this study, a drill hole representative of the Transition Zone in the central 

portion of the Luanga Complex was systematically sampled for unweathered rocks with 

primary magmatic textures and minerals (drill hole LUFD-079; Fig. 2.2A and 2.2B). A 

total of 24 samples were collected for petrographic and mineral analyses, including one 

sample of each thin chromitite layers (06 samples), six samples from the thickest (~ 60 

cm) chromitite layer, and 12 samples from host cumulate rocks (Fig. 2.3).  

 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) photos were taken with a JEOL JCM-

5000 Neoscope, at the Micropaleontology Laboratory of the University of Brasília 

(Brazil), using carbon coating to enhance the contrast and definition. 

 Mineral analyses were performed on polished thin section using a 5 wavelength 

dispersive (WDS) spectrometer JEOL JXA-8230 SuperProbe at the Electron 

Microprobe Laboratory of the University of Brasília (Brazil). Systematic WDS analyses 

were obtained for chromite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Operating conditions for the 

WDS analyses were 15 kV accelerating voltage, with a beam current of 10 nA and 

probe diameters of 3 ?m for chromite and orthopyroxene and 5 ?m for plagioclase. 

Count times on peak and on background were 10 sec and 5 sec, respectively. Using 

these analytical conditions, detection limits are around 80 ppm. Both synthetic and 

natural mineral standards were used for the analyses and the same standards and 

procedure were retained throughout the analytical work. For chromite analysis, the 

cation compositions were calculated following the method described by Haggerty 

(1976) and Robin et al. (1992), Fe

 was calculated assuming perfect stoichiometry.

2.4 - Geology and stratigraphy through the drill hole LUFD-079 
 

The drill hole LUFD-079, located at the central portion of the Transition Zone 

(Fig. 2.2A and 2.2B), intersects several chromitite layers hosted by different rock types 

(Fig. 2.3). From the stratigraphic base to top the drill core comprises interlayered 

harzburgite and orthopyroxenite from the upper portion of the Transition Zone, and a 

Fig. 2.3: Stratigraphic section of the drill core LUFD-079 (i.e., 210 meters deep; left) and a detailed 

section of the main chromitite (right). Note that the Luanga Complex comprises an overturned 

intrusion, but the stratigraphy of the drill core is shown in the original position. The location of the 

samples is indicated. MZ = Mafic Zone; TZ = Transition Zone.

monotonous sequence of norite with minor thin layers of harzburgite from the base of 

the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.3). The chromite-rich layers (Fig. 2.3) are divided into those 

located in the Transition Zone (Lower Group Chromitites - LGC), and those located in 

the lowermost portion of the Mafic Zone (Upper Group Chromitites - UGC). 

Harzburgite is a medium- to coarse-grained olivine + chromite cumulate with 

intercumulus orthopyroxene. Coarse-grained harzburgite usually consists of large 

orthopyroxene oikocrysts enclosing several olivine crystals (Fig. 2.4A). The modal 

composition is variable due to different amount of interstitial minerals, including 

plagioclase as an additional common intercumulus mineral. Orthopyroxenite is a 

medium- to coarse-grained rock with tabular orthopyroxene as cumulus mineral. The 

texture varies from meso to orthocumulate with plagioclase as the predominant 

intercumulus mineral (Fig. 2.4B). The thickest chromitite layer (designated main 

chromitite) is ~ 60 cm thick and occurs at the contact between harzburgite and 

orthopyroxenite (Fig. 2.3). Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase 

adcumulate rock. A thin (i.e., 2-3 m thick) harzburgite layer always occur 15-20 cm 

below thin chromitite layers hosted by norite (Figs 2.3, 2.4C, 2.4D and 2.4E).  

Primary igneous minerals of these cumulate rocks are commonly partially 

replaced by metamorphic assemblages. This replacement is heterogeneous and 

characterized by an extensive hydration that preserves primary textures and the 

compositional domains of igneous minerals. These assemblages include serpentine + 

talc + magnetite ± cummingtonite in replaced harzburgite, talc + serpentine + magnetite 

± cummingtonite in replaced orthopyroxenite (Fig. 2.4B), and hornblende + chlorite + 

epidote in replaced norite. Metamorphic assemblages indicate temperatures up to the 

amphibolite facies of metamorphism, thus consistent with those described in previous 

studies of the Luanga (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and Lago Grande Complexes 

(Teixeira et al., 2015).

2.5 - The chromitite layers 
 

2.5.1 – Petrography 
 

 Chromitite layers intersected by drill core LUFD-079 include the main 

chromitite and 6 thin layers (&amp;lt;10 cm thick) (Fig. 2.3). The main chromitite is an up to 

60 cm chromite-rich layer located at the contact between harzburgite and 

orthopyroxenite layers from the upper portion of the Transition Zone (LGC; Figs. 2.2C 

and 2.3). It has sharp contacts with both the underlying harzburgite and the overlying 

orthopyroxenite, suggesting abrupt changes in the sequence of cumulate minerals in 

both contacts. The main chromitite extends for 1-2 hundred meters along strike, as 

indicated by drill core information, but the continuity beyond that is not constrained due 

to poor outcropping. Massive chromitite prevails (~ 65 vol. %) and is associated with 

irregular domains of chain-textured and disseminated chromitite (Figs. 2.3 and 2.5A). 

Massive chromitite is a fine- to medium-grained chromite cumulate with chromite 

grains representing more than 50 vol. % (Fig. 2.5A). Orthopyroxene and plagioclase, 

commonly replaced by fine-grained aggregates of serpentine, amphibole, chlorite and 

talc, are typically the main interstitial minerals. Chromite occurs as euhedral to 

subhedral annealed crystals with discrete alteration along crystal borders and fractures 

(Fig. 2.5B). Rounded silicate inclusions inside chromite grains are common and have 

variable sizes (Fig. 2.5). These inclusions consist of the same fine-grained replacement 

minerals described for the matrix. Chain-textured chromitite, consisting of 15-20 vol. % 

chromite, is characterized by orthopyroxene pseudomorphs surrounded by dozens of 

medium- to fine-grained chromite crystals (Figs. 2.5C). Fine-grained chromite grains 

are also enclosed by orthopyroxene pseudomorphs in chain-textures chromitites (Fig. 

2.5C). The transition from massive to chain-textured chromitite is gradational and 

marked by the progressive decrease on the chromite modal composition. The same type 

of silicate inclusions observed in massive chromitites occurs in chain-textured 

chromitites, but they are less abundant in the latter. The disseminated chromitite 

contains 5-10 vol. % of cumulus chromite and 95-90 vol. % of variably replaced 

orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Chromite grains in disseminated chromitite are 

extensively altered and rarely have silicate inclusions. Coarse-grained chromitite is 

restricted to a 2 cm thick layer (see pegmatoid chromitite in Fig. 2.3) characterized by 

coarse chromite grains containing a large volume of silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.5D). Both 

coarse chromite crystals and silicate inclusions show irregular shapes in the pegmatoidal 

chromitite (Fig. 2.5D), different from

replaced by a fine-grained aggregate of serpentine and talc. Carbonate-rich veinlets cross cut the 

chromitite. The arrow points upward the stratigraphy. B) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of 

massive chromitite with polygonal contact between chromite grains. Note that chromite grains are 

partially altered along borders and fractures (light gray color). C) Photomicrograph of chain-textured 

chromitite. Chromite crystals are interstitial to orthopyroxene pseudomorphs replaced by amphibole 

(Amp) and talc (Tlc). Note interstitial fine-grained aggregates of chlorite (Chl) and talc, probably 

resulting from alteration of intercumulus plagioclase in contact with Opx.

the euhedral crystals with rounded inclusions characteristic of the main chromitite. All 

three types of chromitites are cross-cut by fine grained amphibole-chlorite-carbonate 

veinlets (Fig. 2.5E). These veinlets do not appear to extensively affect the composition 

of chromite grains (i.e., no significant zonation or reaction border is observed).  

 Thin chromitites (&amp;lt;10 cm thick) are mainly hosted by noritic rocks of the Mafic 

Zone (UGC; Fig. 2.3). These chromitites are fine- to medium-grained chromite 

cumulates with intercumulus plagioclase and orthopyroxene (Fig. 2.4E). Chromite 

grains are euhedral and show many rounded silicate inclusions with well-developed 

inner rims (Fig. 2.5F). These inclusions consist of the same aggregate of fine-grained 

silicates that replace the original intercumulus minerals in the main chromitite of the 

LGC. Locally, sulfide minerals occur at the bottom of the inclusions, facing the base of 

the chromitite layer (i.e., based on oriented thin sections; Fig. 2.5G). 

 

2.5.2 - Spatial analysis of silicate inclusions and their variation through the 

stratigraphy 
 

 Silicate inclusions and “atoll-like” structures are common features in chromite 

grains of the studied chromitites (Fig. 2.5). The three-dimensional shape of these 

inclusions and hosting crystals were described utilizing a SEM (Fig. 2.6). Chromite 

grains are euhedral with well-defined faces without any indication of reaction or 

reabsorption features (Fig. 2.6A). Inclusion-bearing crystals have the same morphology 

of inclusion-free crystals, except for the presence of predominantly rounded inclusions 

in the first (Fig. 2.6B). Inclusion-bearing chromite grains usually have the inclusions 

locked within the crystals, with no physical connection of the included silicates and 

outside matrix minerals. However, few silicate inclusions are connected with the outside 

Fig. 2.5 (cont.) : D) Photomicrograph (crossed polarizers) of pegmatoid chromitite. Note silicate 

inclusions with irregular shape in chromite grains. The intercumulus and inclusion-hosted minerals 

are replaced by a fine-grained aggregate of chlorite and talc. E) Photomicrograph (crossed polarizers) 

of carbonate (Cc)-amphibole-talc veinlet cross cutting massive chromitite. Note that chromite grains 

are surrounded by a fine-grained aggregated of chlorite and talc, probably resulting from alteration of 

intercumulus silicates. F) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of inclusion-bearing chromite crystals 

from a thin chromitite of the Mafic Zone. Note the characteristic sector zoning of inner rims adjacent 

to silicate inclusions. G) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of inclusion-bearing chromite crystal 

highlighting the presence of a sulfide droplet at the bottom of the inclusion. The thin section is 

oriented and the sulfide droplet faces the base of the chromite-rich layer (the arrow points upward the 

stratigraphy).

matrix (Fig. 2.6C). The inclusions are composed of the same silicate minerals that occur 

in the matrix of chromite grains, consisting of extensively replaced plagioclase and/or 

orthopyroxene (Fig. 2.6D).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The silicate inclusions show significant variations in the shape, number and 

volume proportions in chromite crystals from chromitites of the LGC and UGC (Fig. 

2.7). Chromite grains from the LGC commonly have just one large silicate inclusion 

(Fig. 2.7A). The thin pegmatoid chromitite (Fig. 2.3) has chromite crystals with the 

larger silicate inclusions (up to 0.65 mm of diameter enclosed within chromite crystals 

around 1 mm diameter) of all the studied samples (Fig. 2.7B). Upward in the

photo of an euhedral chromite crystal. B) SEM photo of an euhedral chromite crystal showing one 

rounded silicate inclusion. C) SEM photo of chromite crystal with a partially-enclosed silicate 

inclusion. The silicate inclusion appears as a sub-circular shape in one face of the octahedral 

chromite crystal. D) Photo (using a magnifying glass) of chromite grain enclosing a coalescent 

silicate inclusion. The inclusion shape indicates that the inclusion and interstitial minerals 

surrounding the chromite grain are connected.

inclusions (Fig. 2.7C).

2.6 - Mineral Chemistry 

2.6.1-  Orthopyroxene and plagioclase 
 

Systematic studies of mineral chemistry of cumulus minerals from drill core 

LUFD-079 (i.e., orthopyroxene and plagioclase) were limited by metamorphic 

replacement of igneous minerals in several samples. Orthopyroxene was analysed in 

samples of orthopyroxenite and harzburgite from the Transition Zone and norite from 

the Mafic Zone, while plagioclase was just analysed in samples of norite from the Mafic 

Zone. Representative analyses of orthopyroxene and plagioclase are reported in Tables 

2.1 and 2.2, respectively.  

  Orthopyroxene compositions range from En83.49 to En89.9 mol % through the 

top of the Transition Zone and the base of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). The cryptic 

variation of orthopyroxene shows a few reversals and relatively more fractionated 

compositions (En83.49 to En86.45 mol %) in the Transition Zone, whereas the 

compositions of orthopyroxene in norite of the Mafic Zone are more primitive (En89.0 

to En89.84 mol %) (Fig. 2.8). Plagioclase compositions range from An76.61 to An83.20 

mol % in the lower portion of the Mafic Zone. The cryptic variation of plagioclase 

shows a consistent upward increase in An contents, indicating a reversed fractionation 

in the lower portion of the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). Cryptic variations of orthopyroxene 

and plagioclase in drill core LUFD-079 are consistent with the common reversals within 

a general inversed fractionation trend of the Transition Zone and lower portion of the 

Mafic Zone, as described in previous studies of the Luanga Complex (Ferreira Filho et 

al., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). 

2.6.2 – Chromite 
 

 Chromite grains show alteration rims (Figs. 2.5 and 2.7) that are probably 

associated with different compositions. In order to evaluate the compositional variation 

in chromite grains, EMP analyses were performed on line transverses through 35 

chromite crystals with different morphologies (Fig. 2.9 shows 4 representative line 

traverses), totaling ~ 700 analyses. Investigated chromite crystals were separated into 

inclusion-free and inclusion-bearing crystals (see Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 for 

representative analyses from line traverses of inclusion-free and inclusion-bearing 

crystals, respectively). An outer alteration rim characterized by higher reflectance (see 

Fig. 2.9B) is common in both inclusion-free and inclusion-bearing crystals. These 

alteration rims have variable thickness and are commonly continuous along fractures in 



 

68 
 

extensively altered chromite crystals. Composition of chromite changes abruptly in this 

outer rim, becoming enriched in Fe
3+

 and Fe
2+

 (i.e., Fe
3+

# up to 91) at the expense of 

Mg, Cr, Al. This alteration is easily recognized in petrographic studies and have highly 

different compositions compared with the core of the crystals. These rims were avoided 

in the systematic probe investigation and analyses are limited to few line traverses.

2.6.2.1 - Line traverses through inclusion-free crystals 
 

 Inclusion-free crystals have a core-to-rim variation in composition (or concentric 

rim) that varies in thickness according to the modal percentage of chromite. Chromite 

crystals from massive chromitites (i.e., &gt; 50 vol % of chromite) have thinner concentric 

rims compared with chain-textured and disseminated chromitites (i.e., &amp;lt;50 vol % of 

chromite). Line traverses through inclusion-free crystals (Figs. 2.9A and 2.9B) show 

significant progressive core to rim changes in Mg# (i.e., a Mg-Fe core-rim zoning). The 

core of the crystals has higher Mg and lower Fe
2+

 contents than the rims, resulting in an 

up to 40% difference in Mg# across a chromite crystal. Difference in Mg# from core to 

rim progressively decreases for chromitites with higher amount of intercumulus 

minerals, as illustrated by line traverses through chromite crystals from massive (Fig. 

2.9A), chain-textured (Fig. 2.9B) and disseminated (Fig. 2.9C) chromitites. This feature 

(i.e., the progressively lower difference in Mg# for chromitites with higher amounts of 

intercumulus minerals) is matched with progressively lower Mg# in the core of 

chromite grains. Significant differences in Mg# of chromite crystals suggest extensive 

Mg and Fe
2+

 exchange, a subject to be addressed in the discussion of this study. The 

Cr#, Al# and Fe
3+

# are constant in line traverses through different types of chromite 

crystals (Figs. 2.9A, 2.9B and 2.9C), except for few analyses located in the outer bright 

colored rim in some crystals (not analysed for line traverses represented in Figs. 2.9A, 

2.9B and 2.9C). This feature indicates that the suggested extensive exchange between 

divalent cations in chromite crystals (i.e., Mg and Fe
2+

) does not affect trivalent cations 

(i.e., Cr, Al and Fe
3+

).  

2.6.2.2 - Line traverses through inclusion-bearing crystals 
 

 Inclusion-bearing crystals (Figs. 2.5G, 2.5H and 2.7) have an outer alteration 

rim, similar to the one described for inclusion-free crystals, and a variably developed 

rim adjacent to the silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.9D). The latter, designated inner rim, has a 

distinctive morphology consisting of rounded contacts with the silicate inclusion and a 

characteristic sector zoning following the octahedral form of the hosting chromite 

crystals (Fig. 2.9D). The existence and/or extent of the inner rim do not have any 

systematic relation with the size of host chromite crystal and silicate inclusion, the 

number of inclusions, or the chromite modal percentage and texture of the chromitite. 

Line traverses through inclusion-bearing crystals (Fig. 2.9D) indicate significant 

compositional changes close to silicate inclusions.

76 
 

Compared to the host chromite, compositions within the rims adjacent to silicate 

inclusions have higher Cr#, lower Al# and Mg# and similar Fe
3+

# (Fig. 2.9D). These 

relative compositional changes are described for all studied rims regardless the size 

and/or composition of the host chromite.  

2.6.2.3 - Cryptic variation of chromite 
 

Line traverses across chromite crystals of several chromitites from drill core 

LUFD-079 indicate that chromite compositions are highly variable for each sample. 

Compositional variation occurs within a single grain (i.e., zoning) as well as when 

different grains from the same sample are compared. These compositional variations 

pose limits for the use of chromite composition as a parameter for the composition and 

fractionation of the parental magma. The cryptic variation study of chromite through 

drill core LUFD-079 (Fig. 2.8) includes just compositions obtained in homogenous core 

of inclusion-free chromite crystals from chain-textured or massive chromitites. These 

compositions are interpreted to be close to primary crystallization compositions and 

largely reduce the variability resulting from zoned crystals. 

Chromite compositions in crystals from chromitites through drill core LUFD-

079 indicate an increase in Al# along with a decrease in Cr# (Fig. 2.8). Cr# and Al# of 

LGC (including samples from the main chromitite), respectively 45-54 and 32-44, are 

distinctively different from those obtained in UGC, respectively 36-42 and 52-58. The 

Fe
3+

# follows the Cr# and decrease from LGC (6-19) to UGC (1-9). The Mg# in 

chromite is largely controlled by textural features of chromite and the modal 

composition of the chromitite, as indicated in the description of line traverses. Mg# are 

low and close to ~ 20 for all chromitites, except for higher and highly variable values 

(30-66) for samples of the main chromitite. The low values of Mg# obtained for most 

chromitites are likely to result from later alteration processes and, therefore, not useful 

as an indication of magmatic evolution.  

Chromite compositions in crystals from samples through the main chromitite do 

not provide any significant base-to-top compositional trend (Fig. 2.10). Cr# and Al# in 

chromite crystals show negative correlation and a limited compositional range, 

respectively 47-51 and 36-42., except for the unusually Fe
3+

 rich (8-15) and Cr-poor 

(45-50) uppermost sample. Highly variable Mg# (22-62) are likely to result from 

heterogeneous effects of alteration processes, as previously described for other 

chromitites from drill core LUFD-079.

2.7 -  Discussion 
 

2.7.1 - Magmatic compositions of chromite  
, 

 The extensive database of chromite analyses (~ 700 analyses) for chromitites of 

the Luanga Complex obtained in this study indicates a large range of compositions. 

Two common projections of the spinel compositional prism, the triangular Cr-Al-Fe
3+

 

plot (Fig. 2.11) and the plot of Fe
2+

/(Mg+Fe
2+

) vs Cr/(Cr+Al) (Fig. 2.12), are used to 

illustrate the compositional variation of chromite in chromitites. Results indicate that 

LGC have distinctively higher Cr# compared with UGC. The upward decrease of Cr# in 

chromitites of the Luanga Complex matches the fractionation of the magma from 

ultramafic cumulates (olivine and/or orthopyroxene cumulates) in the Transition Zone 

to plagioclase-bearing cumulates in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.8). Our results also indicate 

Fig. 2.10: Compositional variations of chromite throughout the main chromitite of the Transition 

Zone (see stratigraphic section in Fig. 3 for orientation). Chromite compositions are expressed in 

terms of Al# = 100Al/(Al + Cr + Fe
3+

), Cr# = 100Cr/(Cr + Al + Fe
3+

). Modal % indicates the chromite percentage of each sample. The

78 
 

that compositions of chromite from the UGC are distinctively different from those 

hosted in chromitites from continental layered intrusions (Fig. 2.12). While most 

chromitites in continental layered intrusions are located within ultramafic cumulates, 

our results for the UGC add another case for the few examples of chromitites hosted 

within mafic cumulate (e.g., Rum layered intrusion, Henderson, 1975; Upper Group 

chromitites of the Bushveld Complex, Eales and Reynolds, 1986). Due to extensive Fe
+2

 

and Mg compositional variation in chromite, our data is highly scattered in a Fe# vs Cr# 

plot (Fig. 2.12). Therefore, typical trends indicating either a positive correlation 

between Fe# (or otherwise a negative correlation if Mg# is plotted) and Cr# (known as 

the Cr-Al trend by Barnes and Roeder, 2001), or a negative correlation (known as the 

Rum trend by Barnes and Roeder, 2001) are not obvious for chromitites from the 

Luanga Complex (Fig. 2.12). Nevertheless, the very low Cr# of the UGC and the abrupt 

upward decrease in Cr# from the LGC to the UGC are remarkable compositional 

features. Lower Cr# in the UGC results from the increase in Al at the expense of Cr and 

some Fe
3+

 (Fig. 2.8 and 2.12). The upward decrease in the Cr# through a layered 

intrusion has been ascribed to the depletion of Cr in the melt during fractionation 

(Irvine, 1977; Hulbert and Von Gruenewaldt, 1985). However, the content of TiO2 in 

chromite from chromitites of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 2.8) does not show an upward 

increase as expected for progressively more fractionated magmas. It should also be 

noted that chromite in the Upper Group of the Bushveld Complex chromitites have 

higher Cr# compared with chromite in the underlying Middle Group chromitites, a 

feature interpreted as the result of reduced Al2O3 activity by the appearance of cumulus 

plagioclase in cumulates hosting the Upper Group chromitites (Eales and Marsh, 1983; 

Naldrett et al., 2009). The previous discussion suggests that the unusual composition of 

the UGC chromitites are not satisfactory explained by models and processes indicated 

for chromitites from other locations. We suggest that compositions of the UGC 

chromite may be linked to petrological processes associated with peridotites underlying 

each chromitite, an issue addressed in the following discussion.

2.7.2 - Petrological implications of the stratigraphic distribution of chromitites 
 

As commonly described in layered intrusions, chromitites in the Luanga 

Complex occur in specific stratigraphic intervals with distinct petrological 

characteristics. Chromitites occur mainly in the upper portions of the Transition Zone 

and through the immediate contact with the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.2C), a stratigraphic 

interval consisting of several cyclic units interpreted as the result of successive influxes 

of parental magma (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Different models were proposed 

to explain the common association of chromitites and cyclic units. They include, among 

others, the mixing of an injection of primitive magma with a more fractionated magma 

residing in the magma chamber, thus causing chromite to be the sole liquidus mineral 

(e.g., Irvine, 1977) and the result of slumping of semi-consolidated cumulates in a 

chromite-rich slurry (e.g., Mondal and Mathez, 2007; Maier and Barnes 2008; 

Voordouw et al., 2009). It is not the aim of this paper to discuss the processes that lead 

to the accumulation of chromite-rich layers, a highly controversial subject (see Mondal 

and Mathez, 2007 and Naldrett et al., 2012 for reviews and references). We rather want 

to focus on possible petrological implications provided by the stratigraphic sequence 

associated with chromitites in the Mafic Zone (Fig. 2.3). Thin chromitites hosted by 

noritic rocks are always preceded by a thin layer of harzburgite located 15-20 cm below 

each chromitite layer (Figs 2.4C to E). Because this unusual stratigraphic association of 

harzburgite and chromitite is consistently repeated, a petrological link of harzburgite 

layers and chromitites located above them is suggested. Thin chromitites closely 

associated with peridotite-troctolite are also reported in the Rum Complex (O'Driscoll et 

al., 2010). Although chromitites in the Rum Complex occur mainly at the base of 

several peridotite-troctolite cyclic units, thin chromitites also occur a few centimeters 

away from the basal peridotite. O'Drisoll et al. (2010) suggested that chromitites were 

formed by in situ crystallization following assimilation of troctolitic cumulate by a new 

influx of primitive magma at the crystal mush-magma interface. The authors' also 

suggested that chromitites located above the unit boundaries resulted from coeval syn-

magmatic deformation of the crystal mush. This interpretation may be also applied for 

chromitites hosted in noritic rocks of the Luanga Complex. When the new influx of 

primitive magma assimilated norite the concentration (and thus activity) of Al2O3 

should have increased. The relatively lower Cr# and Fe
+3

 of chromite in the UGC may 

result from an increase in Al2O3 activity right in the crystal mush-primitive magma 

interface, just preceding the first appearance of liquidus plagioclase. This suggesting 



 

81 
 

follows O'Driscoll et al. (2010) idea that unusually aluminous composition of chromite 

in the Rum Complex resulted from high Al2O3 content of hybrid liquids originated from 

assimilation of plagioclase-rich cumulate from a picritic magma. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.7.3 - Compositional zonation in chromite grains and its implications for the 

interpretation of chromite compositions 
 

 Our results indicate that extensive compositional variation occurs in different 

scales, as indicated by large variation obtained in analyses of one chromitite (Fig. 2.11B 

and 2.12B) or even within a chromite crystal (Fig. 2.11C and 2.12C). Compositional 

traverses in chromite crystals from several chromitites of the Luanga Complex indicate 

three distinct types of rim or compositional zoning: i. an outer alteration rim, ii. a Mg-

Fe core-rim zoning, iii. an inner rim adjacent to silicate inclusions. Distinct textures and 

compositions of these three types of rim or zoning suggest that they originated from 

different processes.

and Roeder (2001). 



 

82 
 

 An outer alteration rim characterized by higher reflectance (see Fig. 2.9B and 

photomicrographs in Sack and Ghiorso, 1991) is common in chromite crystals from 

chromitites overprinted by metamorphism, especially under lower to intermediate 

grades of the regional metamorphism (i.e., up to amphibolite facies) (e.g., Evans and 

Frost, 1975; Sack and Ghiorso, 1991; Liipo et al., 1995). This alteration is also common 

in chromite crystals in serpentinized and/or hydrothermally altered mafic-ultramafic 

rocks (e.g., Barnes and Roeder, 2001; Mukherjee et al., 2010). The composition of 

chromite in samples of the Luanga Complex changes abruptly in the outer rim, 

becoming enriched in Fe
3+

 and Fe
2+

 at the expense of Mg, Cr, Al, thus moving toward 

the magnetite apex on the spinel prism. The formation of the outer rim is probably 

related to the metamorphic replacement of the primary mineralogy of the Luanga 

Complex. This interpretation is supported by progressively larger outer rims in chromite 

associated with extensively replaced rocks. While chromite grains are commonly 

completely altered to magnetite-ferrichromite in extensively replaced rocks, chromite 

enclosed in relicts of olivine or orthopyroxene have just minor alteration along 

fractures. Once this alteration is easily recognized in petrographic studies and have 

highly different compositions compared with the core, analyses of the outer rim were 

disregarded as far as the magmatic and sub-solidus interpretation of chromite 

compositions of the Luanga Complex is concerned. 

 The Mg-Fe zoning in chromite crystals has a strong correlation with the modal 

percentage of chromite in a given layer (Fig. 2.9A to 2.9C). This is indicated by thinner 

concentric rims in chromite crystals from massive chromitites (i.e., &gt; 50 vol % of 

chromite) compared with chain-textured and disseminated chromitites (i.e., &amp;lt;50 vol % 

of chromite), and has been described in several studies of chromitites (e.g., 

Danyushevsky et al., 2000; Marques and Ferreira Filho, 2003; Spandler et al., 2005). 

The Mg-Fe zoning in chromite crystals results of significant core-to-rim difference in 

Fe
2+

 and Mg contents with none to minor difference in Fe
3+

, Al and Cr contents. The 

progressive core-to-rim decrease in Mg# of chromite crystals may result either from an 

evolving melt composition during crystallization, or by subsolidus exchange of Fe
2+

 and 

Mg between chromite and coexisting silicates during slow cooling of the intrusion. The 

first option is favored by the progressive fractionation of the trapped intercumulus 

liquid coexisting with cumulus chromite (e.g., Henderson and Wood, 1981; Roeder and 

Campbell, 1985). However, the fractionated trapped melt should become enriched in 

TiO2 and Fe
3+

 and therefore, a negative correlation of Mg# and Fe
3+

# along with TiO2 



 

83 
 

contents would be expected for Mg-Fe zoned chromite crystals. Because these 

correlations do not occur in the Mg-Fe zoned crystals of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 2.9), 

the first option is not an appropriate interpretation. The second option demands an 

extensive exchange between divalent cations hosted in tetrahedral sites in chromite 

crystals (i.e., Mg and Fe
2+

) and coexisting silicates. This extensive exchange would not 

be accompanied with exchange between trivalent cations hosted in octahedral sites (i.e., 

Cr, Al and Fe
3+

) in chromite and coexisting silicates due to their lower diffusion rates 

(Sack and Ghiorso, 1991). The second option has been proposed as an explanation for 

Fe
2+

 and Mg variation across chromite grains in chromitites (e.g., Danyushevsky et al., 

2000; Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Spandler et al., 2005), and provides an appropriate 

interpretation for Mg-Fe zoned chromite crystals of the Luanga Complex. 

 Inclusion-bearing chromite crystals have the same Mg-Fe zoning but also show 

additional inner rims adjacent to the silicate inclusions (Fig. 2.9D). The chromite 

composition adjacent to the silicate inclusion (i.e., in the inner rim) have higher Cr#, 

lower Mg# and Al#, and similar Fe
3+

# (Fig. 2.9D), possibly due to crystallization from a 

progressively more fractionationed liquid trapped in the chromite crystal (i.e., following 

the process suggested for progressive fractionation of the trapped intercumulus liquid by 

Henderson and Wood, 1981). Borisova et al. (2012) describe chromites with similar 

compositional variation in coronas adjacent to silicate inclusions from the Oman 

ophiolite. Based on the hydrous Na-Cl-rich composition of the melt inclusions, the 

authors proposed a subsolidus process for the origin of the coronas in chromite from the 

Oman ophiolite, suggesting that hydrothermal or metamorphic processes induced higher 

Cr# in chromite close to the hydrous silicate inclusions. Because silicate inclusions in 

the Luanga Complex are eventually connected to intercumulus minerals, and no 

evidence for hydrous Na-Cl melt inclusions exists, such a hydrothermal-metamorphic 

process is not favored for the inner rim coronas described in our study. In particular, 

reaction of Cr-spinel with intercumulus liquid, as suggested for the inner rim coronas of 

the Luanga Complex, results in both divalent (Fe
2+

 and Mg) and trivalent (Cr, Al, Fe,) 

cation exchange. On the other hand, subsolidus reaction of Cr-spinel and intercumulus 

silicates, as suggested for the Fe-Mg zoning, results mainly in exchange of divalent 

cations. 

 Our results indicate that chromite compositions from chromitites of the Luanga 

Complex (Figs. 2.11 and 2.12) have their primary cumulus composition extensively 



 

84 
 

modified by postcumulus magmatic processes. Although distinct primary magmatic 

compositions are indicated by different Cr# for chromites from the Transition Zone and 

Mafic Zone, the extensive variation of Mg# for a single chromite crystal indicates that 

the compositional field of the Luanga Complex chromitites are not entirely primary 

magmatic. Due to the indicated modification of primary magmatic compositions, it is 

critical to determine what range of compositions of the Luanga Complex chromites 

represents the closest composition of original cumulus chromite. These are the 

compositions useful for defining magmatic trends and/or comparison with other layered 

intrusions. Mass balance arguments are commonly used to indicate that massive 

chromitites with &gt; 70 % vol. chromite are likely to preserve its original igneous 

compositions because there are few other phases available for element exchange (e.g., 

Eales and Reynolds, 1986). This reasoning was used in several studies of chromitites 

(e.g., Bacuri Complex, Spier and Ferreira Filho, 2001; Ipueira-Medrado Sill, Marques 

and Ferreira Filho, 2003), but is not appropriate for chromitites of the Luanga Complex, 

where modal compositions rarely exceed 70 vol. %. Our results suggest, in fact, that just 

the compositions from analyses in the very core of chromite from massive portions of 

the main chromitite (e.g., Fig. 2.9A) represent compositions close to original cumulus 

compositions of the Luanga Complex. None of the other analyses represent cumulus 

compositions. These altered compositions represent &gt; 90 % of the analyses of this 

study, including all analyses of chromite from chromitites of the Mafic Zone. The range 

of chromite compositions likely to represent primary cumulus composition for 

chromitites of the Transition Zone, as well as the range of Fe
+2

-Mg exchange, is 

indicated in figure 2.13. The range of cumulus compositions of chromite of the 

Transition Zone is restricted to analyses with high Mg# in the core of chromite from 

massive portions of the main chromitite (as indicated in Fig. 2.9A). 

 The extensive modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite, 

indicated in our study for the Luanga Complex, is likely to be common in non-massive 

chromitites (i.e., &amp;lt;70 vol. % chromite), and the rule for disseminated chromites in 

mafic intrusions. Therefore, the common use of spinel compositions as a petrogenetic 

indicator for mafic intrusions (e.g., Sack and Ghiorso, 1991; Power et al., 2000; Barnes 

and Roeder, 2001) should be considered with caution and always supported by 

extensive petrographic/analytical investigation of post-magmatic alteration.

2.7.4 - Why different types of inclusion-bearing chromite crystals are formed? 
 

 Silicate inclusions of distinct types are common in chromitites through the 

stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex (Figs. 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7). Different models have been 

proposed to explain the formation of silicate inclusions in chromite (e.g., Augé, 1987; 

Ballhaus and Stumpfl, 1986; Hulbert and Von Gruenewaldt, 1985; Li et al., 2005; 

Lorand and Cottin, 1987; Lorand and Ceulenner, 1989; Roeder et al., 2001; Spandler et 

al., 2005). It is beyond the scope of this article to enter into a thorough discussion of the 

mechanisms of formation of these inclusions, and just a parallel of our observation and 

available models is considered in here.  

 Based on the size and number of inclusions, the inclusion-bearing chromite 

grains of the Luanga Complex split into two groups. LGC commonly have chromite 

crystals with just one large inclusion (Fig. 2.7A), while UGC consist mainly of chromite 

Fig. 2.13: Fe
2+

/(Mg + Fe
2+

) versus Cr/(Cr + Al) of chromites from chromitites of the Luanga Complex. 

The field of primary cumulus composition for chromitites of the Transition Zone (1) is indicated. The 

field of chromite compositions in layered intrusions is from Barnes and Roeder (2001).

grains with several small inclusions (Fig. 2.7C). Both groups show inclusion 

coalescence (Figs. 2.5E and 2.6D), minor accumulation of sulfides at the bottom of 

inclusions (Fig. 2.5G) and rounded shapes (Figs. 2.5 to 2.7). These features support the 

concept that inclusions were formed due to the entrapment of melt during chromite 

growth, a process that requires fast growth rate as described for chromite grains in 

komatiites (e.g., Arndt et al., 1977; Barnes 1985; Godel et al., 2013) and modern picritic 

basalts (Roeder et al., 2001). High growth rate allows the crystallization of chromite 

with skeletal shapes and the entrapment of melt between dendritic branches (Fig. 2.14). 

Different types of inclusion-bearing crystals, as described for chromitites from different 

stratigraphic portions of the Luanga Complex, would thus require different growth rates 

during the evolution of the complex. Chromite crystals hosting just one large inclusion 

demand lower growth rates than those hosting several inclusions, thus allowing the 

coalescence between the entrapped liquid and the development of just one inclusion 

(Fig. 2.14A). On the other hand, chromite crystals hosting several inclusions are formed 

under higher growth rates, allowing the entrapment of many physically isolated melt 

droplets in each crystal (Fig. 2.14B). High growth rate in chromite is generally related 

to high diffusion and cooling rates (Arndt et al., 1977; Barnes and Hill, 1995; Godel et 

al., 2013). This reasoning suggests that the entrapment of many silicate melt droplets 

within UGC is a response to higher cooling rates, caused by new primitive magma 

injections within mafic cumulates. In contrast, chromite crystals from LGC would have 

a slower growth rate due to no major difference in temperature between primitive 

magmas and hosting ultramafic cumulates.

2.8 - Conclusions  
 

The principal conclusions of this study are as follows:  

a) Chromitites in the Luanga Complex occur mainly in the upper portions of the 

Transition Zone, where they are hosted by ultramafic cumulates, and through the 

immediate contact with the overlying Mafic Zone, where they are hosted by 

plagioclase-bearing cumulates. This stratigraphic interval consists of several cyclic units 

interpreted as the result of successive influxes of primitive magma. 

b) Chromite crystals in chromitites from the Transition Zone (i.e., Lower Group 

Chromitites - LGC) have distinctively higher Cr# compared with chromite crystals in 

chromitites from the Mafic Zone (i.e., Upper Group Chromitites - UGC). The upward 

decrease of Cr# in chromitites of the Luanga Complex matches the fractionation of the 

magma from ultramafic cumulates (olivine and/or orthopyroxene cumulates) in the 

Transition Zone to plagioclase-bearing cumulates in the Mafic Zone. 

c) Extensive modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite in chromitite of 

the Luanga Complex is indicated by rimmed and/or extensively zoned chromite crystal. 

Zoned chromite indicates an extensive exchange between divalent (Mg, Fe
2+

) cations 

and minor to none exchange between trivalent cations (Cr, Al and Fe
3+

), and should 

result of subsolidus exchange of Fe
2+

 and Mg between chromite and coexisting silicates 

during slow cooling of the intrusion. 

d) Significant modification of primary cumulus composition of chromite, as indicated in 

our study for the Luanga Complex, is likely to be common in non-massive chromitites 

and the rule for disseminated chromites in mafic intrusions. Therefore, the common use 

of spinel compositions as a petrogenetic indicator for mafic intrusions should be 

considered with caution.

Abstract  
 

The Luanga Complex, located in the eastern portion of the Carajás Mineral Province, 

hosts the largest Brazilian PGE deposit. The deposit is hosted by a sequence of layered 

ultramafic and mafic cumulates and has two distinct styles of PGE mineralization. The 

first, ascribed as Sulfide Zone, consists of a 10 – 50 m thick interval with disseminated 

sulfides located along the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones of the 

intrusion. The mineralogy of the Sulfide Zone consists of base metal sulfides with 

pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; chalcopyrite. The other PGE mineralization, ascribed as 

silicate-related PGE, consists of 2-10 m thick stratabound zones across the Transition 

Zone. These sulfide- and chromite-free rocks, mainly harzburgite and orthopyroxenite, 

do not show any distinctive texture or change in modal composition that characterize 

the PGE enrichment. The Sulfide Zone hosts the bulk of PGE resources of the Luanga 

Complex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au and 0.11% Ni). The Sulfide Zone and 

silicate-related PGE show differences in geochemistry behavior of PGE. The Sulfide 

Zone has Pt/Pd ratios of 0.55 and a positive correlation between all PGE and S. The 

silicate-related PGE has Pt/Pd ratios of 1.2-1.3 and a strong depletion in IPGE. A 

remarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-rich olivines (up to 7400 ppm 

Ni) in harzburgites closely associated with silicate-related PGE mineralization. The 

geochemical and textural differences between these mineralization styles suggest that 

they were formed by distinct geological processes. Our results supports that the Sulfide-

Zone is formed by typical segregation of a sulfide immiscible liquid during fractional 



 

98 
 

crystallization. However, silicate-related PGE is formed by direct crystallization of 

platinum group minerals directly from the magma, in response to PGE saturation of the 

magma.

3.1 – Introduction 
 

  Most of the platinum-group elements (PGE) deposits are hosted by a small 

number of layered intrusions (Cawthorn et al., 2005 and references therein). These 

deposits can be generally subdivided into sulfide- and chromite-related, as exemplified 

by the well-studied world-class PGE deposits of the Merensky reef and UG2 chromitite, 

from the Bushveld Complex (e.g., Barnes and Maier, 2002; Cawthorn et al., 2002 and 

2005; Naldrett, 2004). The concentration of PGE global resources within just a few 

intrusions probably reflects the extremely efficient processes involved during the 

formation of PGE deposits (i.e., PGE enrichment in orders of 10
5
; Mungal and Naldrett, 

2008). The common processes that lead to PGE concentration within sulfide-related 

(Naldrett, 2004 and references therein; Mungal and Naldrett, 2008) and chromite-related 

deposits (Finnigan et al., 2008) are considered sufficiently efficient. Anyways, the 

discussion about alternative processes that lead to PGE accumulation, apart from 

chromite- and/or sulfide-bearing rocks, and their implications for the exploration of 

these elements is still open.  

 Apart from the processes that lead to PGE accumulation, the existence or not of 

PGE-fertile suites worldwide is still a debated issue. Some authors proposed that LIP 

containing Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are formed by magmas with distinctive geochemical 

compositions (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013), while others indicate 

that a systematic association of unusual magmas and magmatic deposits are not 

supported by current data (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015a). The 

Luanga Complex is part of a cluster of PGE-mineralized layered intrusions at the 

eastern part of the Carajás Mineral Province (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Hence, 

a discussion about the existence, or not, of a PGE-fertile suite within this region is 

supported by our results.  



 

99 
 

 This study provides the first systematic geological and geochemical 

characterization of the PGE deposit of the Luanga Complex. Our results provide 

evidence for different styles of PGE mineralization (i.e., sulfide- and silicate-related 

PGE mineralization) within this layered intrusion. These results support a discussion 

about efficient processes able to concentrate PGE, apart from the conventional sulfide- 

and/or chromite-related. Additionally, our data fits into the ongoing discussion of the 

existence of PGE-fertile suites, especially within the Carajás Mineral Province.  

 

3.2 - Regional Setting 

 

3.2.1 - The Carajás Mineral Province  
 

 The Carajás Mineral Province is located in the southeastern portion of the 

Amazonian Craton (Fig. 3.1A). It has become widely known due to several important 

mineral deposits, including several IOCG and Ni world-class deposits and the largest 

iron resources of the world (Dardenne and Schobbenhaus, 2001; Klein and Ladeira, 

2002; Lobato et al., 2005; Xavier et al., 2010). The Carajás Mineral Province also hosts 

the world-class Au-Pd deposit of Serra Pelada (Meireles and Silva, 1988; Berni et al., 

2014). The province is subdivided in two Archean tectonic domains, separated by a 

poorly defined Transition Subdomain (Dall'Agnol et al., 2006; Feio et al., 2013). These 

domains are defined as the Rio Maria Domain to the South and the Carajás Domain to 

the north (Fig. 3.1B; Vasquez et al., 2008).  

The Rio Maria Domain is a typical granite–greenstone terrain (Vasquez et al., 

2008). The Andorinhas Supergroup (Docegeo, 1988) comprises several individual 

Mesoarchean greenstone belts (2,904 ± 29 Ma; Macambira and Lancelot, 1996) and 

metasedimentary rocks (Huhn et al., 1986; Souza and Dall'Agnol, 1996; Souza et al, 

2001). The recent characterization of spinifex-textured komatiites in a greenstone belt 

sequence within the Transition Subdomain (Siepierski and Ferreira Filho, 2016), 

suggests that the Andorinhas Supergroup extends further north than indicated in 

previous regional maps.

101 
 

The basement of the Carajás Domain consists mainly of gneiss-migmatite-

granulite terrains, generally related to the Xingu Complex (Docegeo, 1988; Machado et 

al., 1991; Pidgeon et al., 2000). This Domain comprises Archean volcano-sedimentary 

sequences, which includes the large sequence of metabasalts of the Grão Pará Group 

(ca. 2.75 Ga; Machado et al., 1991; Vasquez et al., 2008) and several mafic-ultramafic 

layered intrusions (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015). 

Different models have been proposed to explain the origin of these rocks, such as an 

intra-plate rift model (Gibbs et al., 1986; Villas and Santos, 2001) and also the evolution 

of a subduction-related environment (Dardenne et al., 1988; Teixeira and Eggler, 1994). 

These volcano-sedimentary sequences are covered by clastic sedimentary rocks from 

the Águas Claras Formation (i.e., Rio Fresco Group; Docegeo, 1988; Araújo et al., 

1988; Nogueira et al., 1994 and 2000). 

 

3.2.2 - Mafic-ultramafic intrusions and associated mineral deposits of the Carajás 

Mineral Province  
 

Several mafic-ultramafic layered complexes intrude rocks of the Xingu Complex 

and Archean volcano-sedimentary sequences (Docegeo, 1988; Ferreira Filho et al., 

2007). These intrusions include, among many others, the Serra da Onça and Serra do 

Puma Complexes (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014) that host large Ni laterite 

deposits in the western portion of the Carajás Mineral Province, and the Vermelho 

Complex (Siepierski, 2016) that also host Ni laterite deposit in the Canaan dos Carajás 

region (Fig. 3.1). The PGE-mineralized layered intrusions of the eastern portion of the 

Carajás Mineral Province, at the Parauapebas region, include the Luanga and Lago 

Grande Complexes (Fig. 3.1; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015; Mansur 

and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Layered intrusions in the Carajás Mineral Province show 

significant differences in magmatic structures and petrological evolution, thus 

suggesting that they belong to different Neoarchean magmatic suites (e.g., Ferreira 

Filho et al., 2007; Rosa, 2014; Teixeira et al., 2015). 

The Serra Leste Magmatic Suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) consists of a cluster 

of small- to medium-size layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions located in the northeastern 

portion of the Carajás Mineral Province (Fig. 3.1). This suite was originally grouped 

based on abundant PGE anomalies of the layered intrusions, disregarding any 

geological, stratigraphic or petrological consideration (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). 

Recent studies of the Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga 



 

102 
 

Complex (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) are the first systematic stratigraphic and 

petrological investigations of layered intrusions ascribed to the Serra Leste suite, thus 

providing data for the composition of their parental magmas and fractionation 

processes. The Luanga Complex, subject of this study, hosts the bulk of the PGE 

resources in the Serra Leste region. 

 

3.2.3 – Luanga Complex  
 

The Luanga Complex is a 6 km long and up to 3.5 km wide layered intrusion 

(Fig. 3.2A) consisting of, from base to top, ultramafic cumulates (Ultramafic Zone), an 

intercalation of ultramafic and mafic cumulates (Transition Zone) and mafic cumulates 

(Mafic Zone; Fig. 3.2B; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Geological section defined 

by drilling indicate that the Ultramafic Zone overlies the Transition Zone, which 

overlies the Mafic Zone, suggesting thus that the layered sequence is tectonically 

overturned (Fig. 3.2B; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The 

Ultramafic Zone comprises an up to 800 m-thick sequence of serpentinites (i.e., 

metamorphosed peridotite) with few meters thick orthopyroxenite lenses at the upper 

portions. The Transition Zone consists of an up to 800 m pile of interlayered ultramafic 

and mafic cumulate rocks. Interlayering in the Transitin Zone consists of 

orthopyroxenite, harzburgite and norite in different scale and variable textures. The 

Mafic Zone consists of an up to 2000 meters-thick monotonous sequence of noritic 

rocks and minor interlayered orthopyroxenite with subordinated chromitite (Mansur and 

Ferreira Filho, 2016).  

 PGE mineralization occurs associated with base metal sulfides between the 

Ultramafic and Transition Zones (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) and associated with 

chromitite layers along the Transition Zone (Diella et al., 1995). A systematic 

description of different styles of PGE mineralization in the Luanga Complex is 

presented in this study.

3.3 – Exploration Review 
 

Mafic-ultramafic rocks and chromitites of the Luanga Complex were identified 

in 1983 during regional exploration developed by DOCEGEO (now VALE S.A.) in the 

Serra Leste region. Following the discovery of up to 2-m thick chromitites, DOCEGEO 

Fig. 3.2: Local geology. A) Geological map of the Luanga Complex (partially modified from 

unpublished report of VALE). Note the location of drill holes referred to in this study. B) Geological 

section on the central portion of the layered complex. PGE mineralized intervals are indicated (partially 

modified from Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). 



 

104 
 

carried out geological mapping, soil geochemistry survey (400 m x 40 m grid) and 

ground magnetometric survey in the Luanga Complex. Four diamond bore holes were 

drilled to test the thickness and lateral continuity of outcropping chromitites. The 

drilling was not positive for chromite mineralization, but intersected anomalous 

concentrations of Pt and Pd, including 9 meters at 2.57 ppm of Pt+Pd (i.e., drill core 

LUFD-04). In 1997, a joint-venture DOCEGEO-Barrick Gold carried out a stream 

sediment campaign over the Luanga Complex area that identified Au anomalies (up to 

3,061 ppb). In 2000, Vale S.A., aiming to increase the Au resources of the Serra Leste 

Au Project (which included VALE’s Serra Pelada deposit), carried out a new soil 

geochemistry survey to test the Au anomalies indicated by Barrick Gold. The sampling 

grid, covering the southern portion of Luanga Complex, indicated a 1 km long trend of 

Pt and Pd anomalies. Due to his anomalous trend with up to 1,450 ppb of Pt+Pd, Vale 

S.A. carried out in 2000 additional soil geochemistry survey in the northern portion of 

the Luanga Complex (next to chromitite layers). This sampling indicated another 1 km 

long Pd and Pt anomalous trend with up to 804 ppb of Pt+Pd, The geochemical survey 

was extended to the central portion of the layered complex and indicated a 2 km 

extension trend of Pt and Pd anomalies with up to 1,436 ppb of Pt+Pd, providing a 

continuous Pt-Pd-Cu anomalous trend along the entire layered intrusion. In 2001, Vale 

S.A. started an exploration program for PGE in the Serra Leste region. Systematic 

geological and structural mapping using RADARSAT and TM5 integrated data, along 

with airborne geophysical survey, led to the discovery of several layered intrusions 

(e.g.,  Formiga, Lago Grande, Luanga Norte, Pegasus, Órion, Afrodite). From 2001 to 

2007 Vale S.A performed 79,335 meters of diamond drilling and several ore technology 

characterization tests in layered intrusions of the Serra Leste region. The resource 

drilling program in the Luanga Complex reached 45,174 meters of diamond drilling. 

The systematic evaluation indicated that the Luanga Complex hosts a PGE deposit with 

resources of 142 Mt@ 1.24g/t PGE+Au and 0.11% Ni, for a given cut-off grade of 0.5 

g/t PGE+Au. These resources were evaluated for a shallow (i.e., aproximatelly 250 

meters deep) open pit.  

 

3.4 - Sampling and Analytical Procedures 
 

For this study, drill holes from the central and northern portions of the Luanga 

Complex (Figs. 3.2A and 3.2B) were systematically sampled in order to select 

unweathered rocks. The sampling was supported by litogeochemical data of VALE’s 



 

105 
 

exploration database. Thin polished sections of the selected samples were studied in 

detail at the microscopy laboratory at University of Brasília. The analytical procedures 

are described as follows.  

3.4.1 - Bulk Rock analyses 
 

For litogeochemical analyses, two representative drill holes that intersect 

different styles of mineralization (LUFD-224 and LUFD-226; Fig. 3.2B) were selected. 

Sample preparation and lithogeochemical analyses were performed at ALS Chemex 

(Canada). Analytical procedures include the whole-rock package plus LOI (ALS 

Chemex codes: ME-XRF06 and OA-GRA06), total S (ALS Chemex codes: S-IR08), 

PGE nickel sulfide collection plus Pt, Pd, Au 30g fire assay ICP (ALS Chemex codes: 

PGM-MS26 and PGM-ICP23) and the 48 elements four acid ICP-MS package (ALS 

Chemex code: ME-MS61). A complete description of analytical methods is available in 

the ALS Chemex Home Page (www.alsglobal.com). 

3.4.2 - Sm-Nd isotopes 
 

 Sm-Nd isotopic analyses followed the method described by Gioia and Pimentel 

(2000) and were carried out at the Geochronology Laboratory of the University of 

Brasília (UnB). Whole-rock powders (~3000 mg) were mixed with 
149

Sm-
150

Nd spike 

solution and dissolved in Savillex bombs. Sm and Nd extraction of whole-rock samples 

followed conventional cation exchange techniques. The isotopic measurements were 

carried out on a multi-collector Finnigan MAT 262 mass spectrometer in static mode. 

The 
143

Nd/
144

Nd ratios were normalized to 
146

Nd/
144

Nd of 0.7219 and the decay constant 

used was 6.54 × 10-12
-1

. The TDM values were calculated using the model of DePaolo 

(1981). Nd procedure blanks were better than 100 pg. Sm-Nd results for 9 samples of 

the Luanga Complex are shown in Table 3.1. 

3.4.3 – Sulfur isotopes 
 

 Sulfur isotopic analyses were carried out at the Geochronology Laboratory of the 

University of Brasília (UnB) and followed an internal methodology. Approximately 

2000µg of sulfide grain powders were enclosed within tin capsules by the automatic 

sampler Thermo Scientific MAS 200R and introduced at the Thermo Scientific Flash 

2000 element analyzer. The sample is heated up to 1800ºC by an automatic addition of 

oxygen and the combustion products are carried out by helium gas. The SO2 is 

separated by a chromatographic column and then sent to the ion fount of the Thermo 

http://www.alsglobal.com/


 

106 
 

Scientific MAT253 IRMS mass spectrometer. After the ionization and acceleration of 

the sample, gas species with different masses are separated and analysed by faraday cup 

collectors. The spectrometer is monitored and the obtained results are treated using the 

software Isodat 3.0.  

 

3.5 - Geology of the Transition Zone and PGE Mineralizations 
 

The Transition Zone of the Luanga Complex (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3) hosts several 

PGE mineralized intervals (Fig. 3.2B). The following description of the Transition 

Zone, based on Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016), aims to provide the stratigraphic 

setting of the mineralized intervals. 

The Transition Zone, about 5 km long and up to 1 km wide, represents the 

central part of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.2A) and comprises a pile of interlayered 

ultramafic and mafic cumulate rocks (Fig. 3.3). Interlayering of different rocks types 

occurs in different scales (from few centimeters to dozens of meters), and is a 

distinctive feature of the Transition Zone. Cumulate rocks have variable textures, from 

adcumulate to orthocumulate, and variable assemblages of cumulus and intercumulus 

minerals, resulting in several different rocks types (Fig. 3.3). The most common rock 

types are orthopyroxenite (orthopyroxene adcumulate), harzburgite (olivine + chromite 

cumulate with either cumulus or intercumulus orthopyroxene), norite (orthopyroxene + 

plagioclase cumulate) and chromitite. The stratigraphic division presented in figure 3 is 

simplified from a complex rock succession and illustrates the main cumulates from the 

Transition Zone. 

 Orthopyroxenite (Figs. 3.3A and 3.3C) is a medium- to coarse-grained rock with 

tabular crystals of orthopyroxene as cumulus mineral. The texture varies from 

adcumulate to meso- and orthocumulate with plagioclase as the predominant 

intercumulus mineral (Fig. 3.3C). Harzburgite (Fig. 3.3C) is a medium- to coarse-

grained olivine + chromite cumulate with meso- to orthocumululate textures. The 

contact between orthopyroxenite and harzburgite in the Transition Zone is commonly 

abrupt (Fig. 3.3C). Norite is a medium-grained orthopyroxene and plagioclase 

adcumulate rock (Fig. 3.3B). It occurs as discontinuous layers commonly following a 

gradational upward fractionation from orthopyroxenite, to plagioclase orthopyroxenite 

and norite.  

 



 

107 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Several chromitites occur at the top of the Transition Zone and at the lower part 

of the Mafic Zone (Diella et al., 1995; Ferreira Filho et al, 2007; Mansur and Ferreira 

Filho, 2016). These rocks consist of fine-grained euhedral cumulus chromite with 

variable proportions of interstitial minerals (mainly extensively replaced plagioclase). A 

systematic description of chromitites throughout the stratigraphy of the Luanga 

Complex is provided by Mansur and Ferreira Filho (submitted) and they are not 

addressed in this study.

the Sulfide Zone. Medium-grained orthopyroxenite with interstitial base metal sulfides. B) 

Representative core sample of norite from the Transition Zone. Adcumulate textured norite consisting

contact of orthopyronenite and harzburgite. Orthopyroxenite consists of cumulus orthopyroxene with 

minor intercumulus plagioclase, while harzburgite consists of cumulus olivine with intercumulus 

orthopyroxene. Ol: olivine; Opx: orthopyroxene; Plg: Plagioclase.  



 

108 
 

Apart from PGE mineralization hosted in chromitites (Diella et al., 1995; 

Ferreira Filho et al., 2007), two distinct styles of PGE mineralization that occur in the 

Luanga Complex are detailed in this study: i) sulfide-related PGE mineralization and ii) 

silicate-related PGE mineralization (Fig. 3.2B).  

3.5.1 - Sulfide-related PGE  
 

PGE mineralization associated with disseminated sulfides hosts the bulk of PGE 

resources of the Luanga Complex (i.e., 142 Mt at 1.24 ppm Pt+Pd+Au and 0.11% Ni; 

VALE internal reports). The stratigraphic section hosting the PGE deposit, referred to 

as the Sulfide Zone (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016), consists of a 10 – 50 m thick 

interval with disseminated sulfides located along the contact of the Ultramafic and 

Transition Zones (Figs. 3.2B and 3.3A). The primary mineralogy of the hosting rocks is 

commonly replaced by metamorphic assemblages. This metamorphic alteration is 

heterogeneous and characterized by an extensive hydration that largely preserves 

primary textures (Fig. 3.3) and the compositional domains of igneous minerals (Ferreira 

Filho et al., 2007; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016).  

The Sulfide Zone is a stratabound PGE mineralization consisting of interstitial 

sulfides (~ 1-3 vol. %) hosted by variably metamorphically altered orthopyroxenite 

(Fig. 3.3A) and peridotite (Fig. 3.4A). The location of the Sulfide Zone along the 

contact zone is variable, such that sulfides may be hosted just by the lowermost 

orthopyroxenite of the Transition Zone, or encompass both the orthopyroxenite and the 

underlying peridotite of the Ultramafic Zone (Fig. 3.3A). The mineralogy of the Sulfide 

Zone does not show major variation through the deposit and consists of base metal 

sulfides with pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B). Magnetite is 

commonly developed at the outer border or along fractures in sulfide blebs (Fig. 3.4C). 

Both magnetite and rare pyrite crystals (Fig. 3.4D) occur in partially altered sulfide 

aggregates.  Chalcopyrite is not abundant (&amp;lt;10 vol% of the sulfides) and commonly 

occurs as fine-grained crystals at the borders of larger pentlandite and/or pyrrhotite 

crystals (Fig. 3.4E). Additionally, thin lamellar chalcopyrite occurs enclosed within 

pentlandite crystals (Fig. 3.4F). The metamorphic transformation of primary igneous 

silicates of the hosting rocks (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) does not seem to 

significantly modify the sulfide mineralogy. 

The occurrence of sulfide minerals is not restricted to the Sulfide Zone. Minor 

sulfide veinlets occur in thin (up to 8 m thick) discontinuous shear zones located along 



 

109 
 

the Luanga Complex. Sulfides in these zones have distinct texture and mineralogy 

described for the Sulfide Zone, showing typically intergrowth with amphibole and 

predominantly composed by chalcopyrite. These occurrences are ascribed as 

hydrothermal sulfides.  

3.5.2 - Silicate-related PGE 
 

 The term silicate-related PGE is used in this study to indicate PGE-mineralized 

rocks devoid of base metal sulfides and/or chromite. The silicate-related PGE 

mineralization of the Luanga Complex consists of 2-10 m thick stratabound zones 

across the Transion Zone.  These zones occur above the Sulfide Zone and do not show 

extensive lateral continuity (Fig. 3.2B). These silicate-related PGE zones commonly 

occur at the contact between layers of distinct cumulate rocks in the Transition Zone 

(Figs. 3.2B and 3.3C), but its occurrence within one rock type is also observed (e.g., 

norite layer intersected by drill hole LUFD-077; Fig. 3.2B). The hosting rocks, mainly 

harzburgite and orthopyroxenite, do not show any distinctive texture or change in modal 

composition that characterize the PGE enrichment (Figs. 3.4G and 3.4H). In this way, 

the PGE enriched intervals were not identified during core logging or routine 

petrographic studies. These PGE-anomalous intervals were just indicated by their 

anomalous Pt-Pd contents. A remarkable feature is the occurrence of anomalously Ni-

rich olivines (up to 7400 ppm Ni; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016) in harzburgites 

closely associated with silicate-related PGE mineralization.  

 

3.6 - Litogeochemistry of PGE Mineralizations 
 

  Two representative drill holes (LUFD-224 and LUFD-227; Fig. 3.2) were 

investigated in detail for a systematic characterization of different styles of PGE 

mineralization of the Luanga Complex.

The plot of S vs PGE contents for unweathered samples with PGE contents 

higher than 500 ppb and/or S contents higher than 0.05 wt.% is shown in Figure 3.5. 

The correlation of these PGE-enriched (&gt; 500 ppb) and/or sulfide-bearing (&gt; 0.05 wt.%) 

indicates three geochemically distinct groups: i. sulfide-related PGE, ii. silicate-related 

PGE and iii. hydrothermal sulfides (Fig. 3.5). The sulfide-related PGE group comprises 

samples with high PGE and S contents (i.e., up to 7000 ppb and 1 wt.%, respectively). 

These samples correspond to orthopyroxenites and peridotites with interstitial base 

metal sulfides from the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.3A). The silicate-related PGE group 

comprises samples with high PGE (i.e., up to 2000 ppb) and very low S contents (&amp;lt;0.1 

wt.%). These samples correspond to orthopyroxenites and harzburgites from the 

Transition Zone (Fig. 3.3C). Finally, the group referred to as hydrothermal sulfides 

corresponds to samples with high S contents (up to 0.7 wt.%) with low PGE contents (&amp;lt;

300 ppb. A description of these groups is provided as follows. 

3.6.1 - Sulfide-related PGE 
 

 The groups referred to as sulfide-related PGE and hydrothermal sulfides include 

samples with S content higher than 0.1 wt.% (Fig. 3.5). The analyses presented in this 

section are core samples from drill hole LUFD-224 (Fig. 3.2A), which intersected the 

Sulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.6).  

 The drill hole LUFD-224 intersects the contact between the Ultramafic and 

Transition Zones, and consequently the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6). A sharp decrease in 

MgO and Al2O3 contents occurs in the transition, from olivine cumulates with 

interstitial plagioclase below the Sulfide Zone to overlying orthopyroxene cumulates 

(Fig. 3.6). Two alteration zones located at the bottom of the drill hole LUFD-224 (i.e., 

the uppermost portion of the stratigraphic column in Fig. 3.6) consists of partially to 

extensively sheared rocks.   

Fig. 3.4 (cont.): E) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of chalcopyrite crystals at the contact between 

pyrrhotite and pentlandite. F) Photomicrograph (reflected light) of intergrowth between thin 

chalcopyrite lamellae and pentlandite. G) Typical core sample of harzburgite from the Transition Zone. 

The harzburgite consists of cumulus olivine and intercumulus orthopyroxene and plagioclase. This rock 

shows high PGE contents (up to 2 ppm) and no sulfide is observed. H) Photomicrograph (crossed 

polarizers) of the harzburgite core sample shown in G. Note cumulus olivine crystals enclosed in 

orthopyroxene oikocryst. Cpy: Chalcopyrite; Mt: Magnetite; Ol: olivine; Opx: orthopyroxene; Pn: 

Pentlandite; Plg: Plagioclase; Py: Pyrite; Po: Pyrrhotite. 



 

112 
 

 

 

 

These altered intervals (~ 96-112 and 145-162 m in Fig. 3.6) have discrete zones with 

lower MgO and higher Al2O3 and S contents (Fig. 3.6) characterized by abundant 

amphibole and sulfide veinlets. Except for the weathered rocks, Ni and S show a 

positive correlation throughout the drill hole LUFD-224, with high Ni contents (&gt; 2500 

ppm) limited to the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6). Pt and Pd show positive correlation with S 

and Ni, but high values are restricted to the Sufide Zone. Hence, samples from the 

altered intervals above the Sulfide Zone belong to the the hydrothermal sulfides group 

while samples from the Sulfide Zone belong to the sulfide-related PGE group (Fig. 3.5). 

 Sulfide-bearing rocks from the Sulfide Zone contain 1-3% of base metal sulfides 

with pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B). The modal proportion of 

base metal sulfides in these rocks is consistent with their high Ni tenors (16-18 wt.%; 

Fig. 3.7A), low Cu tenors (1.3-1.4 wt.%; Fig. 3.7C) and, consequently, high Ni/Cu 

ratios (10-12; Fig. 3.7B). Samples with meaningful Au contents (i.e. up to 0.25ppm) are 

restricted to the Sulfide Zone and the Au tenor is around 5 ppm. High PGE contents in 

drill hole LUFD-224 are restricted to samples from the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6).  These 

samples have strong positive correlation between Pd and S, high Pd tenors (130-140 

ppm; Fig. 3.7E), and remarkably consistent Pt/Pd ratios (~ 0.55; Fig. 3.7D). Pt values 

systematically lower than Pd is a characteristic feature of the Sulfide Zone, with Pt/Pd 

Fig. 3.5: Plot of PGE versus S contents for samples with S and PGE values higher than 500 ppb and 

0.01 wt.%, respectively. The samples split into three groups: i. sulfide-related PGE, ii. silicate-related 

PGE and iii. PGE-depleted sulfides.  



 

113 
 

consistently lower than 1 along the entire extension of the ore zone. Ru and S also show 

a positive correlation and Ru tenor is around 2.5 ppm (Fig. 3.7G). These samples show 

a strong positive correlation between Pd and Ru (Fig. 3.7F), and between Ru and Ir 

(Fig. 3.7H). The positive correlation between PPGE and IPGE is compatible to the 

simultaneous segregation of these elements into the immiscible sulfide liquid during 

magma crystallization. 

 

 

 

 

 Mantle-normalized patterns (Fig. 3.8) for samples from the Sulfide Zone show 

high to moderate PGE enrichment (10-1000 times) and minor to moderate Ni, Cu and 

Co enrichment (2-10 times). The PGE patterns are enriched in Pt, Pd and Rh (i.e., 

Platinum Group Elements – PPGE) relative to Ir, Ru and Os (i.e., Iridium Group 

Elements – IPGE). PGE patterns indicate a progressive increase from incompatible

3.6.2 - Silicate-related PGE 
 

The group referred to as silicate-related PGE includes samples with PGE 

contents higher than 500 ppb and very low S contents (Fig. 3.5). The analyses presented 

in this section are core samples from drill hole LUFD-227 (Fig. 3.2A). 

The drill hole LUFD-227 intersected the upper portion of the Transition Zone, 

comprising mainly orthopyroxenite with minor interlayered harzburgite at the top (Fig. 

3.9). The weathering profile is indicated by progressively lower MgO and higher Al2O3 

contents (Fig. 3.9). The high PGE and S values observed at the top of the drill hole (i.e., 

the lower portion of the stratigraphic column in Fig. 3.9), partially contained within the 

weathering profile, consist of samples of the Sulfide Zone at the northern portion of the 

Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.2A). Samples from the Sulfide Zone in drill hole LUFD-227 

are variably weathered and were not considered in the following discussion, aimed to 

investigate a representative interval of silicate-related PGE mineralization.

Apart from the weathering profile, no significant variation is observed in MgO 

and Al2O3 contents throughout the monotonous sequence of orthopyroxene adcumulates 

in drill hole LUFD-227 (Fig. 3.9). High Ni values (~ 750-1000 ppm) through the 

stratigraphy are consistent with Ni contents of 800-1200 ppm in orthopyroxene in the 

lowermost portion of the Transition Zone reported by Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016). 

The reported values for Ni in orthopyroxene of the Transition Zone, together with very 

low S contents in orthopyroxenite in drill hole LUFD-227 (&amp;lt;0.1 wt.%), indicate that 

bulk rock Ni is mainly controlled by silicates. The distribution of Ni also indicates a 

consistent upward decrease from ~ 1000 ppm above the weathering profile down to ~

750 ppm at the base of the PGE mineralized zone (Fig. 3.9). Following an abrupt 

increase to ~ 1000 ppm at the base of the PGE mineralized zone, Ni contents remain at 

values of ~ 1000 ppm in the upper portions of drill hole LUFD-227. High Pt and Pd 

contents in the silicate-related PGE zone are not correlated with disseminated base 

metal sulfides and S contents. This PGE-mineralized interval has minor to none sulfides 

and very low S contents (&amp;lt;0.1 wt. %). Different from the Sulfide Zone, Pt values are 

systematically higher than Pd in the silicate-related PGE mineralized interval (Fig. 3.9), 

with Pt/Pd ratios at 1.2-1.3 values across the entire zone (Fig. 3.10A). 

 

 

 

 

Mantle-normalized patterns (Fig. 3.10B) for samples from the silicate-related 

PGE zone show none to moderate PGE enrichment (1-100 times) and depleted Ni, Cu

and Co contents. The PGE patterns are enriched in PPGE relative to IPGE, with Ir and 

Os contents below their detection limits, 50 and 30 ppb, respectively. PGE patterns 

indicate a progressive increase from incompatible IPGE toward compatible PPGE, as 

well as a distinct negative anomaly for Au (Fig. 3.10B). The low contents of base 

metals are compatible with the absence of base metal sulfides and low S contents PGE-

enriched in this interval.

samples from the Ultramafic and Transition Zones render variably positive ?Nd 

(T=2.76Ga) values, bracketed between 0.9 and 11.58. Samples from the Mafic Zone 

show slightly negative ?Nd (T=2.76Ga) values, ranging from -0.23 to -0.93. Plotted 

against the stratigraphy, ?Nd (T=2.76Ga) values are scattered but show an upward 

decrease (Fig. 3.11), with negative values restricted to norites of the Mafic Zone.

3.8 – Discussion 
 

3.8.1 - Crustal assimilation and sulfur source 
 

 The role of crustal assimilation in the formation of magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide 

deposits is widely discussed (e.g., Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005; Mungall and Naldrett, 

2008; Naldrett et al., 1999 and 2010). Both Nd and S isotopes are commonly used to 

evaluate the importance of the assimilation of crustal rocks during ascent and 

emplacement of mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Maier et al., 2000; Ripley and Li, 2007).  

 Sm-Nd isotopic data obtained for the Luanga Complex indicates positive ?Nd 

(T=2.76Ga) values, except for the slightly negative values of noritic rocks from the 

Mafic Zone (Fig. 3.11). In terms of crustal assimilation, magmas that assimilated 

significant amounts of older sialic rocks are expected to show negative ?Nd values 

(Maier et al., 2000). Once the cumulates from the Transition and Ultramafic Zones 

show variably positive ?Nd values (from 0.9 to 11.58), crustal assimilation of older 

crustal rocks does not appear to be a significant process during the evolution of their 

parental magmas. Anyways, noritic rocks from the Mafic Zone show slightly negative 

?Nd values (-0.23 to -0.92), contrasting with the analysed norite sample from the 

Transition Zone (?Nd = 2.56). Noritic rocks from Transition and Mafic Zones of the 

Luanga Complex have very similar lithogeochemical features (Mansur and Ferreira 

Table 3.2: Sulfur isotopic data of Luanga Complex. 



 

120 
 

Filho, 2016). The distribution of alteration-resistant trace elements of these mafic rocks, 

characterized by significant Nb and Ta anomalies and LREE enrichment, were 

interpreted as the product of primitive magmas partially contaminated with older 

continental crust (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). This interpretation follows what 

has been proposed for the magmatic evolution of the Lago Grande Complex (Teixeira et 

al., 2015). Mafic cumulate rocks from the Luanga and Lago Grande Complexes have 

very similar distribution of alteration-resistant elements, but the latter has variably 

negative ?Nd values (-0.32 to -4.25). Different Nd isotope compositions for the Lago 

Grande and Luanga Complexes, together with similar fractionation patterns and 

lithogeochemical compositions of their cumulates, may be interpreted as the result of 

similar primitive magmas variably contaminated with crustal rocks. This interpretation 

is consistent with the emplacement of 2.76 Ga layered intrusions within gneisses and 

migmatites of the Xingu Complex (ca. 3.0 Ga). In this scenario the assimilation of 

crustal rocks by the primitive magma would be significant for the parental magma of 

the Lago Grande Complex but minor for the Luanga Complex.  

 

 

 

Fig. 3.11: Variations of ?Nd values throughout the stratigraphy of the Luanga Complex. The ?Nd 

values are calculated for an age of 2.76Ga.  



 

121 
 

The ?
34

S values of the mantle are traditionally considered to be 0±2‰, but some 

studies suggest a larger range around 0‰ (Seal, 2006). The ?
34

S values of the analysed 

samples from the Sulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex fall in the range of 0 ± 2‰, 

which suggests that the sulfur of these rocks is mantle-derived (Fig. 3.12). However, 

once the country rocks of the Luanga Complex were not investigated, sulfur isotope 

results do not provide unequivocal evidence for mantle-derived sulfur, considering that 

country rocks may also show mantle-like signature for sulfur isotopes. The ?
34

S value 

obtained from a sample of hydrothermal sulfide (i.e. 0.35) is similar to the values 

obtained for the Sulfide Zone. Hence, is reasonable to propose that these sulfides may 

be originated by a hydrothermal remobilization of magmatic sulfides of the Sulfide 

Zone. 

The Nd isotopic data for the Ultramafic Zone and Transition Zone, which does 

not suggest major assimilation of older crustal rocks, is thus compatible with a mantle-

derived sulfur signature (Fig. 3.12). Both Nd and S isotope results suggest that sulfur 

saturation that led to the formation of the Sulfide Zone in the Luanga Complex was not 

triggered by the addition of external sulfur, as proposed in several studies of Ni-Cu-

PGE deposits (Fig. 3.12; Ripley and Li, 2007).  

The assimilation of crustal rocks is commonly considered as a key factor for the 

formation of magmatic sulfide Ni-Cu-PGE deposits in mafic-ultramafic intrusions (e.g., 

Ripley and Li, 2003; Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005). However, recent studies have also 

suggested that magmatic deposits were originated from mantle-derived sulfur, as 

exemplified by the Nebo-Babel Ni–Cu–PGE deposit (Fig. 3.12; Seat et al. 2009), the 

Platreef PGE–Ni–Cu deposit (Penniston-Dorland et al. 2008) and the Santa Rita deposit 

(Ferreira Filho et al., 2013). The evidence for another magmatic PGE deposit with 

mainly mantle-derived sulfur, provided in this study, reinforces the suggestion that an 

external source of sulfur is not essential for their genesis.  

 

3.8.2 - PGE source 
 

 The origin of magmas that lead to the generation of magmatic PGE deposits is 

controversial. Some authors propose the existence of igneous provinces where PGE-rich 

magmas were formed (e.g., Maier and Groves, 2011; Griffin et al., 2013). This would 

explain the spatial concentration of PGE deposits in a few locations worldwide. On the 

other hand, some authors argument that current data do not indicate the existence of 

PGE-rich igneous provinces (e.g., Fiorentini et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2015a). These 



 

122 
 

authors propose that the generation of PGE deposits result from multiple enrichment 

factors during evolution of magmas with low PGE contents commonly reported in 

primitive magmas. 

 

 

 

 

 The Luanga Complex is one of the layered intrusions ascribed as part of the 

Serra Leste suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007). This suite was originally grouped based 

on PGE anomalies and spatial association of the mafic-ultramafic intrusions. Current 

data, provided by recent studies (Teixeira et al., 2015; Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 

2016), support the existence of a PGE-fertile suite within the eastern portion of the 

Carajás Mineral Province. Whether this magmatic suite originated from anomalous

123 
 

PGE-rich magmas or by the magmatic evolution of regular mafic magmas is the subject 

of current studies in the Carajás Mineral Province..  

 Systematic studies in Lago Grande (Teixeira et al., 2015) and Luanga (Mansur 

and Ferreira Filho, 2016) Complexes suggest that layered rocks in both intrusions 

fractionated from moderately primitive basaltic magma. Apart from similar rock types 

and PGE mineralizations, the magmatic evolution of these layered intrusions resulted in 

distinct magmatic structure, stratigraphic sequence and Nd isotope composition. 

Because the composition of the parental magmas of the Luanga and Lago Grande 

Complexes is not constrained by common features available in several layered 

intrusions (e.g., chilled margins, volcanic equivalents, feeder dykes), discussions 

regarding their PGE contents are not straightforward. An unusually PGE-rich parental 

magma provides a convenient explanation for the abundance of PGE mineralizations in 

the Serra Leste region, as well as different styles of PGE mineralization in individual 

intrusions. However, mafic-ultramafic magmas with abnormally enriched PGE contents 

are uncommon and PGE-mineralized layered intrusions are not usually considered to 

originate from PGE-rich magmas.  

 In addition to magmatic PGE deposits hosted in layered intrusions, the Serra 

Pelada Au-Pd hydrothermal deposit (Meireles and Silva, 1988; Berni et al., 2014) also 

occurs in the Serra Leste region. The Serra Pelada deposit Au-Pd mineralization is 

located 10 km northwest from the Luanga Complex (Fig. 3.1B). Berni et al. (2014) 

propose that the mineralizing fluids of this deposit become enriched in PGE by 

interacting with mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Serra Leste suite. This assumption 

contributes for the existence of a PGE-fertile underplate beneath the eastern portion of 

the Carajás Mineral Province. The existence of a PGE-fertile magmatic province would 

thus justify the spatial association of several PGE-mineralized layered intrusions and the 

unusually PGE-enriched Au deposit of Serra Pelada.  

3.8.3 - Genetic model for the PGE-deposit  
, 

Our results indicate that two highly different styles of magmatic PGE 

mineralization occur in the Luanga Complex. These are referred to as sulfide- and 

silicate-related PGE mineralizations (Fig. 3.2B).  

The sulfide-related PGE, comprising the Sulfide Zone, consists of PGE 

associated with interstitial base metal sulfides and resembles typical deposits originated 



 

124 
 

from sulfide liquids segregated from mafic–ultramafic magmas (e.g., Campbell et al., 

1983; Naldrett, 2004). The silicate-related PGE mineralization, on the other hand, 

occurs in rocks with no base metal sulfides. Host rocks of silicate-related PGE 

mineralization have no distinctive feature compared to adjacent unmineralized rocks. 

Sulfide-related and silicate-related PGE mineralization have distinct mantle-normalized 

PGE profiles (Fig. 3.8 and 3.10A) and Pt/Pd ratios, typically 0.5-06 and 1.2-1.3, 

respectively. The differences between both mineralization styles, together with its 

different stratigraphic positions, suggest that they formed by distinct processes. Because 

these different styles of PGE mineralization are closely associated to the Transition 

Zone, a genetic model for their origin should be consistent with the magmatic evolution 

of this stratigraphic interval.  

A simplified model for sulfide- and silicate related PGE mineralizations of the 

Luanga Complex is shown in figure 3.13. The crystallization of olivine cumulates in the 

Ultramafic Zone without the crystallization of sulfide minerals progressively upgrades 

the S content of the residual magma (stage 1; Fig. 3.13). The Transition Zone marks an 

abrupt change in the dynamics of the magmatic chamber, caused by several magma 

inputs characterized by cyclic units (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Hence, these 

periodic inputs of primitive magma are considered responsible to trigger the S 

saturation of the magma and consequently the segregation of a sulfide liquid. Due to the 

high partition coefficients, PGE and base metals segregated into this sulfide liquid 

(Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005), which originates the Sulfide Zone between the Ultramafic 

Zone and Transition Zone (stage 2; Fig. 3.13). Sulfur isotopes of the Sulfide Zone have 

mantle-like signature (Fig. 3.12), which means that sulfur saturation is not likely to be 

attained by new injections of crustal contaminated magmas.  

The silicate-related PGE mineralization occurs above the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 

3.2B). The Transition Zone originated from several magmatic pulses, such that the 

depleted resident magma that followed the segregation of the Sulfide Zone may again 

become progressively enriched in PGE. Thus, if this magma does not reach the S 

saturation again, the progressive PGE enrichment would not be accompanied by sulfide 

segregation. We consider that the development of silicate-related PGE zones indicates 

PGE saturation in the magma leading to concomitant crystallization of silicates and 

Platinum Group Minerals (stage 3; Fig. 3.13). The processes that led to PGE 

accumulation within these horizons are still poorly constrained. The investigation of 



 

125 
 

platinum group minerals (PGM) is currently being developed to investigate the minerals 

containing PGE. The accumulation of PGE apart from chromite- and/or sulfide-bearing 

rocks has been documented in other layered intrusion (Knight et al., 2011; Ferreira 

Filho et al., 2007). Models suggesting a direct crystallization of PGM from magma have 

already been proposed (Hiemstra, 1979). Anyways, there is no clear agreement about 

the processes that originate these chromite- and/or sulfide-free PGE-bearing rocks.  

 

 

 

 

The occurrence of hydrothermal sulfides, with no PGE content and no magmatic 

characteristics, few meters above the Sulfide Zone (Fig. 3.6), is not genetically related 

with the magmatic evolution of the complex. These sulfide-bearing rocks are probably 

formed by post-magmatic hydrothermal processes that remobilizes sulfide minerals but 

apparently do not concentrate PGE (stage 4; Fig. 3.13). Anyways, it is not the aim of the 

Fig. 3.13: Schematic model illustrating the formation of different styles of PGE mineralization 

throughout the Luanga Complex. See text for explanation. UZ: Ultramafic Zone; TZ: Transition Zone; 

MZ: Mafic Zone. 



 

126 
 

present study to discuss the genetic model of these hydrothermal sulfide-bearing rocks, 

once they do not appear to significantly disturb PGE-bearing rocks.  

In summary, the Sulfide Zone marks a moment of S saturation while the silicate-

related PGE rich horizons mark the PGE saturation of the magma. The S saturation is 

triggered by periodic primitive magma influxes at the contact of the Ultramafic Zone 

and the Transition Zone (Fig. 3.13). The formation of PGE-bearing rocks within 

stratigraphic horizons that marks dynamic moments in the evolution of a given 

magmatic chamber is common and also documented in the Bushveld Complex (e.g., 

Naldrett, 2004). The processes that control the PGE accumulation in sulfide- and 

chromite-free horizons are still poorly constrained. 

3.8.4 - Sulfides with high Ni tenor and its implications  
, 

Previous studies, based on extremely high Ni contents in olivine (up to 

7500ppm) and orthopyroxene (up to 1600ppm), indicate an anomalously Ni-rich 

parental magma for the Luanga Complex (Mansur and Ferreira Filho, 2016). The 

authors considered two possible explanations for the origin Ni-rich magma: i. a parental 

magma derived from pyroxenitic mantle sources (Sobolev et al., 2007) or ii. Ni 

upgrading through dissolution of previously formed nickel-rich sulfide melts (Keer and 

Leitch, 2005). The model proposed by Keer and Leitch (2005) provides an explanation 

for both the high nickel and PGE contents, as the dissolution of previously formed Ni-

Cu-PGE sulfides increases both Ni and PGE of resulting magma. Our results provide 

additional data to contribute with this discussion and understand the relation between 

high Ni parental magma and PGE contents of the Luanga Complex.  

The study of chalcophile elements in sulfide bearing rocks of the Luanga 

Complex indicates a positive correlation between Ni and Cu with S (Fig. 3.7). 

Additionally, these sulfides show remarkably high Ni tenors (up to 18 wt.%) with low 

Cu tenors (up to 1.4 wt.%). These results are compatible with the sulfide assemblage of 

pentlandite &gt; pyrrhotite &gt; &gt;&gt; chalcopyrite (Fig. 3.4B) and high Ni contents in olivine 

and orthopyroxene crystals from the Ultramafic and Transiton Zones (Mansur and 

Ferreira Filho, 2016). A comparison between Ni, Cu and PGE tenors of different PGE 

deposits worldwide is given in figure 3.14. The Sulfide Zone of the Luanga Complex 

stands out among other intrusions due to its high Ni and low Cu tenors, resulting in a 

very low Ni/Cu ratio. In contrast, PGE tenors are not different, and eventually lower, 

when compared to other intrusions with much lower Ni/Cu ratios (Fig. 3.14).   



 

127 
 

 

 

 

Additionally, PGE mineralization is a remarkable characteristic of all the layered 

intrusions of the Serra Leste suite (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015), 

while high Ni olivine has so far been documented just in the Luanga Complex (Mansur 

and Ferreira Filho, 2016). Because systematic studies, including olivine analyses, in 

layered intrusions of the Serra Leste region is so far restricted to the Lago Grande and 

Luanga Complexes, the model proposed for PGE mineralization of the Luanga 

Complex should be considered with discretion for other layered intrusions in the region. 

3.8.5 - Constrains for Ni and PGE exploration in the Carajás Mineral Province  
 

 The identification of anomalously high-Ni magmatism (Mansur and Ferreira 

Filho, 2016), as well as the characterization of different styles of PGE mineralization in 

Luanga Complex in this study, provided additional data to be considered during mineral 

exploration for magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE in the Carajás Mineral Province. Following the 

model developed by Kerr and Leitch (2005), Mansur and Ferreira Filho (2016) 

interpreted these features as the result from the "cannibalization" of previously formed 

Ni-PGE sulfides. This model, previously proposed to explain the origin of extremely 

Ni-rich olivines associated with Ni-PGE orebodies in the Kevitsa intrusion in Finland 

(Yang et al., 2013), implies that the new inputs of Ni-rich fresh magma of the Transition 

Fig. 3.14: Comparison of Ni, Cu and PGE tenors and Ni/Cu ratios of different PGE deposits 

worldwide. The data is obtained from Naldrett (2004) and references therein. LZ: Lower Zone; UZ:

128 
 

Zone have partially dissolved early formed sulfides. Exploration for magmatic Ni-Cu-

PGE deposits in the Carajás Mineral Province indicated several PGE-mineralized 

layered intrusions, but typical massive Ni-Cu-PGE deposits were not described in the 

region. The indirect evidence that such deposits may have formed in the Carajás 

Mineral Province is very positive for mineral exploration. Massive Ni-Cu-PGE deposits 

are commonly hosted in small conduit-type mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Barnes et al., 

2016), as exemplified by Nebo-Babel (Seat et al., 2009) and Limoeiro (Mota-e-Silva et 

al., 2013). Fingerprints of conduit-type Ni-Cu sulfide deposits are usually very small, 

representing thus a challenge to exploration.  

 Another important feature to be considered during further exploration programs 

in the Carajás Mineral Province is the occurrence of non-traditional PGE-rich layers in 

the Luanga Complex. PGE mineralizations that are not related to sulfide- and/or 

chromite-bearing rocks, characteristic of the silicate-related PGE ore described in this 

study, do not provide the usual associated geochemical anomalies (e.g., Cu and Cr) 

expected in PGE deposits. Silicate-related PGE mineralizations are not restricted to the 

Luanga Complex and also occur in the Serra da Onça Complex (Macambira and 

Ferreira Filho, 2005; Ferreira Filho et al., 2007) (Fig. 3.1B). These stratabound silicate-

related PGE mineralizations are also not identified by any characteristic texture or 

mineralogical feature during drill core logging. These suggests that they may have been 

overlooked during previous exploration focused on traditional PGE deposits associated 

with base metal sulfides or chromitites.  

Mafic-ultramafic intrusions in the Carajás Mineral Province have characteristics 

suggesting a favorable potential to host magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. The most 

significant are listed as follows:  

i. The Carajás Mineral Province hosts several mafic-ultramafic intrusions 

within a Neoarchean cratonic terrain; 

ii. Many layered intrusions have primitive parental magmas emplaced in 

dynamic magmatic system (e.g., Vermelho Complex; Luanga Complex); 

iii. The cluster of PGE-mineralized intrusions in the Serra Leste region suggests 

the existence of a PGE-fertile suite in the eastern portion of the Carajás 

Mineral Province (Ferreira Filho et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2015); 

iv. New inputs of Ni- and PGE-rich magmas in the Luanga Complex originated 

from the "cannibalization" of previously formed Ni-PGE sulfides; 



 

129 
 

3.9 – Conclusions 
 

 The main conclusions derived from the present study are listed below. 

? Apart from chromitites, two PGE mineralization styles occur in the Luanga 

Complex. These are referred to as sulfide-related PGE and silicate-related PGE. 

? The sulfide-related PGE comprises the Sulfide Zone, a 10-50 m thick 

stratabound zone of disseminated base metal sulfides (~ 1-3 vol.%) located 

along the contact of the Ultramafic and Transition Zones. 

? The Sulfide Zone has high Ni tenors (16-18 wt.%) and Ni/Cu ratios (10-12), 

compatible with the high modal percentage of pentlandite in the sulfide 

assemblage. PGE ore has Pt/Pd ratios lower than 1 (~ 0.55) and PPGE-enriched 

mantle-normalized patterns.  

? The silicate-related PGE mineralization consists of 2-10 meters thick 

stratabound zones, located stratigraphically above the Sulfide Zone. These PGE-

rich zones consist of cumulates (orthopyroxenite and harzburgite) with no 

distinctive textural and mineralogical features compared to barren rocks.  

? Silicate-related PGE is characterized by Pt values systematically higher than Pd 

with Pt/Pd ratio around 1.2-1.3. Mantle-normalized patterns show high 

enrichment of Pt, Pd, Rh and Au without significant contents of Ir and Os.  

? Nd isotopic data for cumulated from the Ultramafic Transition Zones show 

positive ?Nd (T=2.76Ga) values while cumulates from the Mafic Zone show 

slightly negative values. These positive values suggest that no extensive 

contamination with older crustal rocks took place during the development of the 

Luanga Complex. 

? Sulfur isotopes show a narrow range of variation for ?
34

S values (between -

1.69‰ and 0.35‰), which indicates that the sulfur of these rocks are possibly 

derived from mantelic source.  

? Textural and geochemical differences between sulfide- and silicate-related PGE 

mineralizations support that they formed by different processes. While sulfide-

related mineralization results of segregation of immiscible sulfide liquids, 

silicate-related PGE mineralization formed possibly due to saturation of PGE in 

the magma and co-precipitation of silicates and PGM. 

? The Sulfide Zone shows high Ni tenors and extremely high Ni/Cu ratios when 

compared to other PGE deposits worldwide.

eastern portion of the Carajás Mineral Province (Serra Leste suite).

CONCLUSÃO DA DISSERTAÇÃO 

 

As conclusões detalhadas da dissertação estão divididas em três partes, cada uma 

no final de cada um dos capítulos apresentados. Entretanto, uma versão sintética das 

conclusões pode ser demostrada desta forma: 

 

1. Sobre a intrusão: 

 

i. O Complexo Luanga é uma intrusão acamadada de médio porte, 

subdividido em três porções principais. A evolução do Complexo é 

dinâmica, marcada pela sucessiva entrada de novos pulsos magmáticos 

em um sistema magmático aberto.  

ii. Os conteúdos de Ni nas olivinas da Zona de Transição do Complexo 

Luanga encontram-se entre os maiores valores registrados no mundo. A 

formação de um magma anômalo em níquel pela dissolução de sulfetos 

previamente formados é considerada adequada para explicar estes 

resultados.  

 

2. Sobre a mineralização  

 

i. Dois estilos diferentes de mineralização de EGP são observados no 

Complexo Luanga. Estes são indicados como Sulfide Zone e silicate-

related PGE e possuem características distintas. 

ii. A Sulfide Zone é um horizonte de 10-50 metros de espessura, localizado 

na passagem entre as Zonas Ultramáfica e de Transição, com uma 

disseminação de sulfetos (i.e. 3% vol.). A silicate-related PGE é 

representada por horizontes de 2-10 metros de espessura, 

estratigraficamente acima da Sulfide Zone, que apresentam concentrações 

anômalas de EGP e nenhuma associação com sulfetos e/ou cromita.  

iii. Diferenças texturais e geoquímicas entre os dois estilos de mineralização 

indicam que estes se formaram por processos geológicos distintos. A 

Sulfide Zone é formada pela segregação de um líquido imiscível de 

sulfeto, ao passo que a silicate-related PGE é gerada pela saturação do 

magma em EGP. 



 

139 
 

iv. Isótopos de S indicam uma fonte mantélica para os sulfetos da Sulfide 

Zone, de forma que não é necessária uma fonte externa de enxofre para 

que o magma atinja a saturação nesse elemento.  

 

3. Sobre os cromititos 
 

i. Cromititos estratiformes, com textura variada e espessura de até 60 

centímetros, ocorrem ao longo do Complexo Luanga, hospedados no 

topo da Zona de Transição e base da Zona Máfica.  

ii. Em função do extensivo processo de metamorfismo que afeta as rochas 

do Complexo Luanga, as composições dos cristais de cromita são 

modificadas. A alteração da composição primária é marcada em cristais 

zonados, com  Mg# (Mg/Mg+Fe
2+

) progressivamente menor do núcleo 

para a borda.  

iii. Alterações da composição primária de cristais de cromita comprometem 

sua aplicabilidade em estudos petrogenéticos.  

 

4. Sobre o magmatismo na Província Mineral Carajás 

 

i. Os resultados apresentados suportam a existência de uma província fértil 

para a formação de depósitos de EGP na porção nordeste da Província 

Mineral de Carajás.  

ii. Os dados de Ni em olivina, bem como o tenor de Ni elevado indicam que 

magmas anômalos em Ni foram gerados na Província Mineral de 

Carajás.
