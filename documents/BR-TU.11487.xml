the removal of thick layers of soil under native scrubland (Cerrado) on the right bank of 
the Paraná River in selvíria (state of Mato grosso do sul, brazil) for construction of the ilha 
solteira hydroelectric Power Plant caused environmental damage, affecting the revegetation 
process of the stripped soil. over the years, various kinds of land use and management 
systems have been tried, and the aim of this study was to assess the effects of these attempts 
to restore the structural quality of the soil. The experiment was conducted considering five 
treatments and thirty replications. the following treatments were applied: stripped soil 
without anthropic intervention and total absence of plant cover; stripped soil treated with 
sewage sludge and planted to eucalyptus and grass a year ago; stripped soil developing natural 
secondary vegetation (capoeira) since 1969; pastureland since 1978, replacing the native 
vegetation; and soil under native vegetation (Cerrado). in the 0.00-0.20 m layer, the soil was 
chemically characterized for each experimental treatment. a 30-point sampling grid was used 
to assess soil porosity and bulk density, and to assess aggregate stability in terms of mean 
weight diameter (MwD) and geometric mean diameter (gMD). aggregate stability was also 
determined using simulated rainfall. the results show that using sewage sludge incorporated 
with a rotary hoe improved the chemical fertility of the soil and produced more uniform 
soil pore size distribution. leaving the land to develop secondary vegetation or turning it

intRoDuction

Among the disturbances that can be imposed 
upon a soil body, the removal of thick soil layers 
leads to the most significant deterioration of natural 
resources and can compromise the sustainability 
of the environment (Doran and Parkin, 1994). 
Construction of embankments, creation of landfill 
sites, clearing of routes for highways, and mining 
activities all involve this procedure, which 
typically requires the use of heavy, high capacity 
earthmoving machinery. These large-scale civil 
engineering projects promote soil compaction, 

principally within the layers closest to the surface. 
The concomitant damage to the soil structure 
may hampers the growth of plant root systems, 
and also reduces aeration and water infiltration. 
Decreased infiltration contributes to surface runoff, 
with consequent dislodging and transport of soil 
particles associated with fertilizers and organic 
matter for example. This transport can occur in the 
form of aggregates and, or, as aqueous suspensions 
(Letey, 1985; Soane, 1990; Soane and Ouwerkerk, 
1995; Streck et al., 2004).

The anthropogenic actions which frequently 
cause the most severe degradation to soils 

over to pastureland produced an intermediate level of structural soil quality, and these two 
treatments produced similar results. stripped soil without anthropic intervention was of the 
lowest quality, with the lowest values for cation exchange capacity (cec) and macroporosity, 
as well as the highest values of soil bulk density and percentage of aggregates with diameter 
size&amp;lt;0.50 mm, corroborated by its lower organic matter content. however, the percentage of 
larger aggregates was higher in the native vegetation treatment, which boosted MwD and 
gMD values. therefore, assessment of some land use and management systems show that 
even decades after their implementation to mitigate the degenerative effects resulting from 
the installation of the Hydroelectric Plant, more efficient approaches are still required to 
recover the structural quality of the soil.

Keywords: aggregate stability, soil compaction, stripped soil, soil quality.

ResuMo: ReCupeRação de um LatossoLo degRadado peLa ImpLantação 
de uma usIna HIdReLétRICa

a retirada de espessas camadas de solo sob cerrado nativo da margem direita do rio paraná, em 
selvíria, ms, para a construção da usina Hidrelétrica de Ilha solteira, provocou degradação ambiental, 
com reflexos no processo de revegetação do solo decapitado. Esse local foi submetido às tentativas de 
usos e manejos diversificados ao longo dos anos, constituindo o objetivo deste trabalho avaliar o efeito 
das abordagens aplicadas à recuperação da qualidade estrutural do solo. O experimento foi realizado 
considerando cinco tratamentos e 30 repetições. Os tratamentos experimentais consistiram em: solo 
degradado (decapitado), sem intervenção antrópica e com ausência de cobertura vegetal; solo degradado, 
tratado com lodo de esgoto e cultivado com eucalipto e gramínea há um ano; solo degradado, mantido com 
capoeira em regeneração natural desde o ano de 1969; solo com pastagem desde 1978, em substituição 
à vegetação nativa; e solo sob vegetação nativa (Cerrado). A caracterização química do solo para cada 
tratamento experimental foi realizada na camada de 0,00-0,20 m. Uma grade de amostragem com 
30 pontos foi utilizada para avaliar a porosidade e densidade do solo e os índices de estabilidade de 
agregados diâmetro médio ponderado (DMP) e diâmetro médio geométrico (DMG). A estabilidade de 
agregados foi também determinada com chuva simulada. Os resultados evidenciaram que a utilização de 
lodo de esgoto incorporado com enxada rotativa melhorou a fertilidade química e promoveu distribuição 
mais equilibrada do tamanho de poros do solo. Os tratamentos com capoeira e pastagem apresentaram 
nível intermediário de qualidade estrutural do solo, sendo mais similares entre si. A qualidade do solo 
degradado e sem intervenção antrópica foi a mais prejudicada, havendo valores menores de capacidade 
de troca catiônica e macroporosidade, bem como valores maiores de densidade do solo e de porcentagem 
de agregados com diâmetros&amp;lt;0,50 mm, corroborados pelo seu menor teor de matéria orgânica. Já o 
porcentual de agregados de tamanhos maiores foi mais expressivo no tratamento sob vegetação nativa, 
o que refletiu positivamente nos valores de DMP e DMG. Portanto, mesmo decorridas várias décadas da 
implantação de alguns dos sistemas de uso e manejo avaliados, para mitigar os efeitos deletérios advindos 
da instalação dessa Usina Hidrelétrica, ainda são necessárias abordagens mais eficientes para recuperar 
a qualidade estrutural do solo.

are inappropriate mining practices and the 
installation of hydroelectric plants, both of 
which have potentially degenerative effects on 
the chemical, physical, and biological properties 
of the soil (Duda et al., 1999; Colodro et al., 
2007; Modesto et al., 2009). Mining activities 
can completely alter the characteristics of the 
remaining substrate, including the soil particle 
composition of the soil (Espindola et al., 2000). 
Since the 1960s, the increasing demand for energy 
within Brazil has been met by expanding the 
number and generating capacity of hydroelectric 
plants. The construction of each new plant has 
been accompanied by the removal of thick layers 
of soil in the surrounding area. The magnitude 
and extent of the consequent impacts on the 
environment extend far beyond the time and space 
of the construction period and area. However, 
when the mantle is thick, as is the case with 
Oxisols, it has proven possible to construct a new 
and fertile soil profile (Tavares Filho et al., 1999) 
in a relatively short period of time. This has been 
achieved through measures such as land leveling; 
control of soil acidity; fertilization; cultivation 
of, for example, leguminous plants (Boni et al., 
1994) or eucalyptus associated with grasses after 
application of sewage sludge (Colodro et al., 2007).

Soil aggregates consist of assemblies and 
rearrangements of the primary soil particle 
fractions (sand, silt, and clay), and determine the 
soil structure (Brady, 1989). Therefore, evaluation 
of the soil physical quality can be performed 
by considering the properties of its aggregates. 
Aggregate development and modification are 
dependent on specific local circumstances, such that 
aggregate characteristics are sensitive indicators of 
the history of land use and soil management (Watts 
and Dexter, 1997; Tormena et al., 2008; Vezzani 
and Mielniczuk, 2011). In addition, chemical 
properties, such as organic matter content, have 
been positively associated with macroaggregation 
in soils (De Gryze et al., 2008; Anders et al., 2010) 
and with soil structural quality (Sá et al., 2010). 
Monitoring of chemical properties may assists in 
understanding the mechanisms through which 
land mitigation may be achieved, for instance in 
restoration of areas degraded by the installation of 
hydroelectric plants.

environmental mitigation techniques applied 
to the areas surrounding the Ilha Solteira 
Hydroelectric Plant, SP, Brazil, provide the 
recovery of degraded soil. The objective of the 
present study was evaluation of soil chemical 
and physical quality in areas surrounding this 
hydroelectric plant. This was carried out through 
examination of the soil under various land use 
and management systems that represent different 
levels and periods of human intervention.

MateRial anD MethoDs

The study was carried out on the Teaching and 
Research Farm of Universidade Estadual Paulista, 
Ilha Solteira, SP, Brazil, and is located within the 
municipality of Selvíria, MS, on the right bank 
of the Paraná River (51º 22’ W, 20º 22’ S) at an 
altitude of 355 m. The local climate type (Köppen 
classification scheme) is Aw, with average annual 
precipitation of 1,300 mm. The relative humidity 
is from 60 to 80 % during the rainy months 
(October to March), and from 50 to 60 % in the 
driest months. The average annual temperature 
for the region is 23.7 ºC, with an average of 25.7 ºC 
for the hottest months (January and February), 
falling to 20.6 ºC in the coldest months (June and 
July) (Setzer, 1966).

The local topography is gently undulating to flat, 
with the soil covered by native vegetation typical 
of the Cerrado. The original soil is an Oxisol (Soil 
Survey Staff, 2010), corresponding to a Latossolo 
Vermelho by the Brazilian classification system 
(Embrapa, 2006), of medium texture, and very deep 
and rich in Fe and Al oxyhydroxides (Demattê, 
1980). In the early 1960s, part of the soil (from an 
area of 700 ha) was excavated to a depth of 6.0 m 
and taken to the embankment and foundations of 
the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Power Plant, SP. The 
stripped soil exhibits part of the B horizon, and this 
has remained exposed since 1969. An inspection in 
1992 found high levels of soil surface compaction 
(Bonini and Alves, 2011). However, in some areas, 
natural regeneration in the form of rarefied and 
low-growing vegetation has started and has been 
allowed to remain in this condition until the present 
study was conducted.

In 2003, the soil condition (stripped and hence 
degraded, or undisturbed during the power plant 
construction) and vegetation (natural, pasture, 
natural regeneration, or bare) of the land available 
for the study around the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric 
Plant were surveyed. Soil samples for analysis 
were collected, in which there were 30 sampling 
points (repetitions) within a 12 × 10 m plot per 
treatment. Areas corresponding to four treatments 
were delineated: SD, degraded stripped soil with 
an absence of spontaneous plants and without 
human interventions for land regeneration; SDCap, 
stripped soil upon which secondary scrub vegetation 
(capoeira) has developed since 1969 as a result of 
natural regeneration; SNat, soil beneath the native 
vegetation of the Cerrado; and SPas, where the 
native vegetation has been replaced by pasture. For 
treatment SD, the B horizon has remained exposed 
since 1969. A regeneration treatment, consisting of 
the application of sewage sludge, followed by the 
cultivation of eucalyptus and grasses, was applied 
to randomly selected plots within the SD area, 
establishing the fifth treatment: SDle.

The conversion of part of the SD area to SDle 
was through the following operations. A sequence of 
two subsoilings to a depth of 0.40 m was performed 
in January and February of 2003. In July 2003, the 
sewage sludge was applied in a single broadcast 
operation (rate: 60 Mg ha-1, dry weight basis). The 
sludge was first manually distributed over the 
surface, and then incorporated to a depth of 0.10 m 
using a rotary hoe. The sewage application rate 
was defined after considering the rates adopted in 
various investigations of soil regeneration, such 
as those by Kitamura et al. (2008) and Colodro 
and Espindola (2006), which had previously been 
conducted in the same geographical region of Brazil 
as the present study. The sewage sludge, which 
was predominantly of domestic origin and had been 
produced by the extended aeration process, was 
obtained from the Sewage Treatment Plant operated 
by Sanear (Araçatuba Sanitation Company S.A.) in 
Araçatuba, SP, Brazil. Chemical characterization of 
the sludge was performed by Colodro and Espindola 
(2006), who determined that the concentrations 
of heavy metals in the sewage sludge met the 
limits established by the principal national and 
international environmental monitoring agencies 
(Table 1). Microbiological characterization of 
the sludge, performed by Modesto et al. (2009), 
indicated 0.04 eggs g-1 of total solids, for both 
protozoa and helminths, satisfying the maximum 
limit established by Cetesb (1999) and identifying 
the sludge type as Class B. Correction of soil acidity 
was performed with limestone, incorporated by 
light harrowing, so that base saturation was raised 
to 60 %. In August 2003, the experimental plot was 
planted to eucalyptus (eucalyptus citriodora) in a 
2.0 m between rows and 1.5 m between plants in 
0.40 m deep furrows. Seeds of the grass Brachiaria 
decumbens were broadcast over the entire surface 
of the plot, with two objectives: to absorb the excess 
nitrate generated by the addition of the sewage 
sludge and to increase the organic matter content 
of the soil. The grass was not cut.

For treatment SPas, the substitution of native 
vegetation for pasture (Brachiaria decumbens) 
was effected in 1978. Soil preparation consisted 
of heavy harrowing (large disc harrow) and light 
harrowing (leveling harrow). Liming to raise 
the base saturation to 60 % and fertilization 
were performed as part of the conversion to 
pasture and during subsequent renovations of 
the pasture. The animal stocking rate was 2.5 
animal units ha-1 yr-1.

For each treatment, soil particle distribution 
analysis was conducted on a composite sample 
from the 0.00-0.20 m layer collected from a 30-point 
grid. The maximum differences identified between 
treatments (?48 g kg-1) for clay and total sand 
content were considered to be of low physical 
significance (Table 2).

Soil sampling was performed in 2004. Chemical 
characterization was conducted on samples 
collected from the 0.00-0.20 m layer, with the aim 
of assisting understanding of the evolution of the 
experimental treatments since their inception, and 
focused on parameters likely to affect the stability 
of aggregates. The methodology made available in 
Raij et al. (2001) was employed, with soil coming 
from 10 sampling points per treatment.

Determinations of soil bulk density (Blake 
and Hartge, 1986), and porosity (Camargo 
et al., 2009), consisting of total, macro-, and 
microporosity (water content retained under 
a  t e n s i o n  o f  6  k P a )  w e r e  p e r f o r m e d  w i t h 
undisturbed samples. These samples were taken 
from the 0.00-0.05 m layer in the designated plot 
for each experimental treatment using 100 cm3 
volumetric rings. For each plot, the 30 sampling 
points were on a square grid, with a distance of 
2 m between adjacent points.

Analysis of the stability of the soil aggregates in 
water was performed according to methods outlined 
by Kemper and Chepil (1965). Sampling points were 
located on the previously established 30-point grid, 
and undisturbed soil samples were obtained from the 
0.00-0.20 m layer. In duplicate, 25 g of the air-dried 
soil sample for each sampling point were passed 
through a set of sieves with mesh openings of 9.52, 
7.93, 6.35, 4.00, 2.00, 1.00, and 0.50 mm. From the 
soil masses retained in the sieves, the distribution 
of the soil aggregates by size class was determined, 
from which mean weight diameter (MWD) and 
geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the aggregates 
were computed.

Additional stability testing was performed using 
a rain simulator, operated under hydraulic loading 
conditions sufficient to maintain a constant rate of 
raindrop formation (Boyle-Mariotte principle), as 
described by Roth et al. (1985). In duplicate, 3 g of 
the air-dried soil sample for each sampling point, 
as previously mentioned, were kept under an 
average precipitation rate of 60 mm h-1 for a period 
of 20 min; sieves were utilized to retain aggregates 
o f  t h r e e  s i z e  c l a s s e s :  9 . 5 2 - 6 . 3 5 ,  9 . 5 2 - 4 . 0 0 , 
and 9.52-2.00 mm. The retained size-selected 
aggregates were subsequently transferred to 
aluminum crucibles with the aid of a wash bottle, 
and dried in an oven (105 ºC) to constant weight. 
From the dry weights determined, the percentages 
of aggregates which resisted the simulated rainfall 
were obtained.

The experimental data were subjected to 
analysis of normality (SAS, 2002) and were 
transformed whenever necessary to achieve an 
approximately normal distribution. Mean values of 
soil properties between treatments were compared 
using the confidence intervals (95 %), according to 
Payton et al. (2000).

Results anD Discussion

Chemical properties of the soil demonstrate 
that for all the experimental treatments the pH 
remained in the acid range, with values&amp;lt;5.0 
(Table 3). The highest concentration of organic 
matter (OM) was found in the soil under native 
vegetation, that is, Cerrado with no history of 
human interventions. The average OM content 

did not differ significantly between the soil under 
native vegetation and the soil now under pasture, 
showing the positive effect of grasses on the 
accumulation of organic C in the soil.

Degraded soil resulting from stripping which had 
experienced no human interventions directed toward 
regeneration (treatment SD) was highly compacted 
(soil bulk density (Bd) = 1.92 Mg m-3) and displayed 
the lowest content of organic matter, approximately 
12 % of the maximum observed value (soil under 
native vegetation, SNat; Table 3). Soil from stripped 
areas where scrub vegetation (capoeira) appeared as 
a result of natural regeneration reached an organic 
matter content approximately half that of the soil 
under natural vegetation (SNat) and under pasture 
(SPas). The determination of OM content for the 
degraded soil to which sewage sludge was applied 
(SDle) showed that this treatment was effective 
in improving the condition of the degraded soil. 
Regeneration of the soil occurred, the organic matter 
content of the soil increased, and this made the 
cultivation of eucalyptus possible. The effectiveness 
of sewage sludge in the regeneration of degraded 
soils has been verified in other investigations, such 
as Colodro and Espindola (2006).

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) values for the 
soils of the different treatments followed, in general, 
the same trend as observed for the organic matter 
content (Table 3). However, although the organic 
matter content of the soil treated with sewage 
sludge (SDle) was approximately 40 % lower than 
for the SNat and SPas soils, the SDle soil displayed 
the highest mean CEC. An explanation for this 
observation can be found in the presence of organic 
matter in an amorphous state within the SDle soil; 
this colloidal material has a significantly greater 
surface area than for organic materials in a less

advanced state of decomposition (such as plant 
remains), which contributed to the increase in the 
negative charge carried by soil (Lopes and Guidolin, 
1989). With regard to the chemical fertility of the 
soils, the SDle treatment led to large increases in 
the levels of nutrients, especially P, Ca, and Mg, 
with associated improvements in the sum of bases 
(SB) and the base saturation (V). The treatment 
also offered control of Al toxicity to plants and of the 
acidity of the soil. Taken together, these observations 
serve to emphasize the importance of the type and 
the quality of the OM applied in recovery programs 
for degraded soils. These results are in agreement 
with other investigations carried out in the same 
geographical region as the present study, which 
evaluated soils treated with biosolids and cultivated 
with corn and beans (Nascimento et al., 2004), and 
with tree species (Modesto et al., 2009).

For the soil under the native vegetation of the 
Cerrado, soil Bd = 1.19 Mg m-3 was consistent with 
its soil particle properties (Reichert et al., 2009) and 
the absence of any agricultural use and management 
(Tables 2 and 3). The soil under capoeira, which 
was regenerating naturally (SDCap), displayed a 
Bd = 1.65 Mg m-3 very close to that observed for the 
soil under pasture (SPas, Bd = 1.68 Mg m-3). This 
similarity in Bd and hence compaction reflects, in 

part, the history of the stresses applied to the soils 
of these treatments. There was regular traffic of 
heavy machinery over the SDCap soil during the 
construction period of the hydroelectric plant, while 
the SPas soil was burdened by grazing livestock. 
Excluding the soil under native vegetation, the 
soil from the SDle treatment exhibited the lowest 
Bd (1.61 Mg m-3), an observation which may be 
attributed principally to the alleviation of compaction 
provided during the incorporation of the broadcast 
sewage sludge. The most intense degradation was 
observed where the soil had been stripped and there 
had been no subsequent regeneration (treatment 
SD); this was evidenced by the high value for Bd of 
1.92 Mg m-3, which is a recognized consequence of 
the occurrence of high accumulated strains on a soil.

Compaction of the soil under the different 
treatments compared to the soil under native 
vegetation, revealed by the changes in Bd, 
compromised the total porosity (TP) of the soil, 
and was further reflected in decreases in the 
macroporosity of the soil (Table 3). The TP of the 
SNat soil was greater than the upper value of 
0.50 m3 m-3 indicated as desirable for plant growth 
(Kiehl, 1979). The distribution of the TP between 
micro- and macroporosity was most balanced for the 
soil into which sewage sludge had been incorporated,

with the macroporosity of this SDle soil coming 
closest to that for the soil under native vegetation. 
Various authors have proposed minimum values 
of soil macroporosity as necessary for gas diffusion 
and for avoidance of physiological damage to plant 
roots, for example, ?0.10 m3 m-3 (Grable and Siemer, 
1968) and ?0.14 m3 m-3 (Carter, 1988; Mueller 
et al., 2008; Reynolds et al., 2009). For most of the 
evaluated treatments, the macroporosity exceeded 
these minimum suggested values.

Indications of the structural stability of the soils 
from the different treatments were obtained by 
comparing the size distributions of the aggregates 
(percentages by dry weight within different size 
classes) that were stable in water. The soils under 
the SD and SDle treatments proved to be the least 
structurally stable from the significantly (p&lt;0.05) 
greater proportions of aggregates smaller than 
0.50 mm for these soils in comparison to the other 
treatments (Table 4). A higher proportion of small 
aggregates is attributed to more facile fragmentation 
of larger aggregates; in the context of the present 
study, this may be explained by the history of the 
SD and SDle soils and especially the impact of 
extensive use of heavy earthmoving machinery 
(Oliveira et al., 2004) in the area surrounding the 
hydroelectric plant.

Comparing the proportions of aggregates 
stable in water among the different experimental 
treatments, the values for the size classes 
9.52-7.93, 7.93-6.35, and 6.35-4.00 mm were 
largest for the soil under native vegetation (Table 
4). For the treatments that underwent some 
degree of human intervention, clear differences 
among the treatments were only detected in the 
proportions of stable aggregates with sizes&amp;lt;6.35 
mm. Considering the two smallest size classes, 
1.00-0.50 mm and&amp;lt;0.50 mm, the percentages 

in these classes were smallest for SNat. For the 
2.00-1.00 mm class, the proportion for SNat was 
substantially smaller than for SDCap and SPas 
and not significantly different from the values 
for SD and SDle. The predominance of larger, 
water-stable aggregates in the soil under native 
vegetation in comparison to the other treatments 
was attributed to the positive effect of organic C on 
the stability of larger aggregates (Demarchi et al., 
2011; Costa Júnior et al., 2012). These results 
are in accord with Bonini and Alves (2011), who 
conducted evaluations of the physical quality of 
a previously exposed soil (B horizon remaining) 
in an experimental area similar to that of the 
present study. In their study, the B horizon had 
been exposed by deep stripping, and the soil 
subsequently was under 17 years of agricultural 
management with green manure, limestone, 
gypsum, and forage grasses (Brachiaria).

Among the managed systems, the stability 
of aggregates with sizes larger than 6.35 mm 
from soil under pasture appeared to be no better 
than for aggregates from the SDCap and SDle 
treatments (Table 4). This was despite the higher 
level of organic matter in the SPas soil, which 
was similar to the level in the soil under native 
vegetation (Table 3). This indicates that the soil 
compaction produced by trampling of the ground 
by cattle masked the combined contributions 
to the aggregation afforded by the growth of 
roots of pasture grasses and the activity of 
soil microorganisms and fauna (Haynes and 
Beare, 1997). The net result found for the SPas 
treatment was a decrease in the percentage of 
the macroaggregates found to be stable in water 
(Longo et al., 1999) compared to SNat. This 
decrease in macroaggregate stability in a managed 
system is in accordance with findings from Horn 
et al. (1995), who affirmed that compaction is one

of the factors responsible for the generation of 
denser aggregates of low structural resistance.

In regard to aggregates in the SDle soil, this 
treatment did not improve soil structural condition 
in relation to the most degraded soil (SD). For each 
size class, there was no difference in the percentage 
by weight of water-stable aggregates between the 
SDle and SD soils (Table 4). These contrasts with 
the SDCap and SPas treatments, for which the 
proportions of aggregates in the smallest size 
class (&lt;0.5 mm) were much less than for the SD 
and SDle soils, with associated increases for the 
intermediate size classes. This apparent lack 
of improvement under the SDle treatment may 
have been a consequence of the relatively short 
time (one year) between the incorporation of the 
sewage sludge into the soil and the collection and 
evaluation of the soil samples. In comparison, 
the other treatments had been under their 
respective systems of management for decades. 
It is recognized that the duration under which a 
system of use and management is operated has a 
profound effect on the structural quality of the soil. 
A recognized phenomenon, which can be invoked 
to explain changes in aggregate stability, is age 
hardening, in which an increase in the internal 
resistance of the aggregates develops over time to 
the extent that the connections between the solid 
particles of an aggregate are preserved during 
the period following the initial tillage of the soil 
(Utomo and Dexter, 1981).

Significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) percentages of 
stable aggregates in the size classes from 9.52-
7.93 to 6.35-4.00 mm for the soil under native 
vegetation were reflected in the mean weight 
diameter (MWD) of the SNat aggregates, 4.74 mm, 
which was the highest value among the treatments 
(Table 4). Considering the remaining treatments, 
the sequence of MWD values was SPas &gt; SDCap 
&gt; SDle = SD; this demonstrates the importance 
of plant cover in the recovery of degraded areas 
(Demarchi et al., 2011). The behavior of the values 
for geometric mean diameter (GMD) was similar. 
The GMD gives an estimate of the most frequently 
occurring size class in a soil. With the exception of 
the SNat soil, the estimates were ?1.02 mm; while 
for the soil under native vegetation, the estimate 
was 3.5 times greater.

For soils displaying a high degree of compaction 
or where plant cover has only recently been 
established (Table 3), the aggregates are generally 
less resistant to the action of external forces (Horn 
et al., 1995), such as the impact of water drops from 
a mechanical rain simulator. These expectations 
were confirmed by the tests of aggregate stability 
under simulated rain for the treatments of the 
present study. Thus, the SD and SDle treatments 
exhibited lower percentages of weight retained for 

the three classes of aggregate size evaluated than 
did the other three treatments (Table 5).

The results for the SPas, SDCap, and SNat 
treatments reflected the positive effects of plant 
cover on soil structure. These three treatments 
behaved as a single group, with no significant 
differences among them for any of the aggregate 
size classes (Table 5). The tests of aggregate 
stability under rain for the size classes 9.52-6.35 
and 9.52-4.00 mm divided the treatments into two 
groups: (SDle = SD) &amp;lt;(SDCap = SPas = SNat). 
However, for the size class 9.52-2.00 mm there 
was differentiation between the SDle and SD 
treatments, with division into three groups: SDle 
&amp;lt;SD &amp;lt;(SDCap = SPas = SNat). The placement of 
the SDle treatment with the degraded soil SD on 
the basis of the relative stability under simulated 
rain of different aggregate size classes was in 
accord with the aggregate size distribution results 
obtained by wet-sieving (Table 4). The soil of the 
SDle treatment had passed through tillage only 
a year before the collection and testing of the soil 
samples, so that the SDle aggregates were the 
least age-hardened (Utomo and Dexter, 1981). 
Thus, the rapid entrance of water into the soil 
pores during the testing of the dry aggregates in 
the rain simulator may have led to their rupture 
(Caron et al., 1996), thereby compromising the soil 
structural stability.

conclusions

The hypothesis of this research was partially 
accepted, since there was only a significant 
improvement in soil quality treated with sewage 
sludge and planted with eucalyptus and grasses. 
The physical quality of the stripped soil without 
a n y  a m e l i o r a t i o n  p r o c e d u r e  w a s  t h e  m o s t 
impaired. The incorporation of sewage sludge 
improved the chemical fertility and total porosity 
of the soil; in addition, soil macroporosity was 
increased and the distribution between macro- 
and microporosity became more similar to each 
other. The natural regeneration treatment with 
development of scrub vegetation (capoeira) and 
the soil under pasture presented intermediate 
levels of structural quality and a high degree of 
similarity in soil physical properties.

Alterations in land use and management 
caused effects on soil structure. These effects 
were reflected with considerable sensitivity in 
the stability of soil aggregates, especially when 
evaluated through size distributions following 
agitation in water.

Size distributions of the water stable aggregates 
were increasingly shifted towards smaller aggregates 
with increased environmental degradation. Key 
factors for improvement in the quality of aggregation 
are the input and residence time of organic matter 
in the soil.
