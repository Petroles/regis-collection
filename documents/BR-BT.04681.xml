Simulación de vibración inducida por vórtice en cilindro de libre oscilación

Abstract
The flow around a circular cylinder was simulated using both laminar and turbulent modeling, depending on Reynolds number (laminar for the Re 200 case and turbulent for Re 10.000 case). The preliminary cases were run with a Reynolds number of 200, for the purpose of testing the methodology, the moving mesh methods and the parameters settings. For those cases, a laminar formulation was used and a two-dimensional mesh was built, in order to save time and computational resources. In the Re 10,000 cases, the LES turbulence model was used and a tri-dimensional mesh was applied. The cylinder is free to oscillate in the transverse direction and the Rigid Body motion equation is solved with external elastic and damping forces. Simulations were carried out for a small mass-damping parameter m*z=0.013, where m*=3.3 and z=0.0026.

Introduction
The case of an elastic mounted cylinder is the most studied problem related to vortex induced vibration, concerning the computation of the unsteady flow behind the cylinder and the motion caused by the variation of the lift force due to vortex shedding.
As can be seen in Williamson and Govardhan (2004) this problem has been studied experimentally and also numerically for a large variety of conditions, such as Reynolds numbers, mass-damping parameter, mass ratio (m*) and reduced velocity. A large number of results can be found in literature, mainly experimental in low or medium Reynolds numbers. Numerical results are more difficult to obtain due to the large computational resources required to predict accurately the behavior of this kind of flow. A good example of the challenges related to the simulation of large Reynolds three-dimensional turbulent flows around bluff bodies can be seen in Breuer (1998).
Another difficulty associated with the vortex shedding problem is turbulence modeling. As pointed out by Menter (2012), “depending on the Reynolds number, experience shows that classical URANS models do not provide any spectral content, even if the grid and time step resolution are sufficient for that purpose. It has long been argued that this behavior is a natural outcome of
the RANS averaging procedure (typically time averaging), which eliminates all turbulence content from the velocity field". For this reason many authors advocate the use of Scale-Resolving Simulations (SRS) or Subgrid-scale models (SGS) as better alternatives for the simulation of the flow around bluff bodies with large separation regions.
Those models are based on filtering the governing equations in order to calculate the flow structures (eddies) that are bigger than the filter (generally a size associated with the mesh) and modeling just the small scales of the flow, which have the smaller portion of the energy. The most used SGS models are the Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS).
This work aims is to be a reference to future simulations using higher Reynolds numbers and/or the inclusion of one or more cylinders in the domain. The work was divided into two phases, where the initial simulations were carried out using a low Reynolds number (Re=200) and the further ones with Reynolds 10,000.
The low-Re number studyhas a laminar regime andthe flow is basically two-dimensional. Because of that, the mesh can be significantly reduced using just one element in the spanwise direction (or a purely 2D mesh), making this condition a good test case for the methodology developed, which will be described further in the article.
The main objective is to evaluate if the numerical models chosento solve this problem are suitable and if the methodology tested can be extended to other types of problem. After these first tests with low Reynolds, a tri-dimensional model for the cases with Reynolds 10,000 was built, run and its results compared with experimental data available in literature.
All low Reynolds simulations were carried out using the commercial software package ANSYS CFD (ANSYS CFX and ANSYS Fluent) and some comparison between modeling and simulation in those tools will also be a result of this work. For the Re 10,000 cases, the ANSYS Fluent package was selected.
Physics modeling and equations
This problem requires solving two differentpheno-mena, the fluid flow and the rigid body motion caused by the unsteady forces around the body. However, this is not a simple task because the movement of the body influences the flow and this new flow field also affects the forces on the body. This problem is known as a two-way fluid structure interaction.
For the initial cases, where the results were obtained with the low Reynolds number, the calculations were carried using laminar formulation and for the cases with higher Reynolds number, Large Eddy Simulation turbulence modeling was used. In the LES method, the application of the filter function in the Momentum Conservation equation leads to a modified expression, which includes an additional term that intends to model the effects of the small scales of turbulence in the largest eddies of the flow. This new term requires an additional modeling, which in this case is the most classical approach: the Smagorinsky model.
In short, the equations solved in the simulations are: Continuity Equation (equation 1) for both formulations (laminar and LES), thetraditional Conservation of the
Momentum for an incompressible flow (equation 2) for the low-Re cases, the filtered Momentum Equation (LES formulation) (equation 3) for the Re 10,000 cases and the rigid body dynamic equation to solve the cylinder motion (equation 4). The domain is discretized with many small control volumes, called cells, where the quantities of interest must be conserved, and this set of cells is known as the domain mesh. The most common discretization techniques are the Finite Volume Method, used in ANSYS Fluent, and the element-based finite volume method (EbFVM), which is used in ANSYS CFX.

Simulation domain and parameters
The next sections describe the computational model created, its dimensions, the mesh characteristics and the correlations used to determine the mesh size based on the flow near the cylinder walls. Finally, the results obtained and comparisons with some experimental data are shown.
Computational domain, boundary conditions and mesh characteristics
The computational model created has its dimension parameterized relative to the diameter (D) of the cylinder. In the flow direction, the domain has 10D in the cylinder upstream region and 20D in the wake region, behind the cylinder. In the transverse direction, where the motion is calculated, the domain has 10D for each side, totaling 20D,as shown in figure 1. In the spanwise direction, there are two different sizes depending on the Reynolds number. For the low-Re cases, the domain size is 0.5D and just one cell is placed in this direction, emulating a 2D condition (this was necessary because CFX does not accept a pure 2D mesh) and for the Re 10,000 cases the spanwise size is n times diameter (n D), based on the studies of Breuer (1998, 2000).
The velocity is prescribed in the “x” direction in the top, bottom and upstream faces of the domain and in the downstream side a pressure condition is applied. At the cylinder walls, the no-slip condition is used, which means that when the cylinder is in movement, the velocity of the flow is the same as the body velocity, due to the zero velocity condition in the wall.
In order to generate a mesh that is able to solve correctly both laminar and LES equations, capture the larger scales of the flow and also capture the boundary layer effects reasonably, the mesh built is full hexahedral and based on constant growth of the first layer cell, whose size is calculated based in the boundary layer thickness.
To estimate the boundary layer thickness,a simple correlation for laminar flow was used and the resulting value was divided by 10, to determine the first cell size. The correlation used is shown in equation 7.

Two different first cell sizes were found, one for each Reynolds Number problem. Starting from the obstacle walls, a growth factor of 1.05 was applied in all directions. The models were built with a cylinder diameter value of 0.01m, so the boundary layer estimated size is 0.0035m for Re 200 cases and 0.0005 for the Re 10.000 cases.
To guarantee that the first cell size will be adequate to correctly capture the boundary layer effects, the non-dimensional number y+ must have a value of around 1. This value can be estimated using the correlation shown in equation 8, where the U* is the estimated velocity near the wall, y is the first cell height, p is the density and p the viscosity. The estimated g+ number in the simulations with Reynolds number 200 is 1.08 and for the Re 10,000 case is 2.88.

Simulation parameters
The Large Eddy Simulation technique requires, besides a good quality mesh with a level of refinement enough to capture the desired turbulent structures, a timestep small enough to describe the evolution of these phenomena during the simulation time. The choice of the timestep is closely associated with the frequency of the large scales of the flow, which in this case are the vortices emitted.In that light, the vortex shedding frequency is used as a time reference and this period is divided into 400 timesteps to describe the phenomena well.
To predict the vortex-shedding frequency, the Strouhal number is used. This number is a dimensionless number which relates flow characteristics with a geometric dimension and a vortex-shedding frequency. Its formulation is given by equation 9.
(9)
From Norberg (2003), for a circular cylinder this value is approximately 0.2, which gives a vortex-shedding frequency of 0.4Hz for the low-Re case and a frequency of 20Hz for the Re 104 case. Using 400 timesteps per cycle of vortex shedding, the value of each time step is 0.00625s for the low-Re case and 0.000125s for the Re 10 4 case.
Another way to check if the timesteps and the mesh size are compatible with each other is the Courant Number. This quantity is often used to analyze the solution stability and its formulation is given by:
where C is a non-dimensional number which relates the flow velocity at a certain point of the grid with the timestep and the mesh size nearby. This number can be interpreted as how many cells a fluid particle travels within the timestep chosen. If the Courant Number has a value of 1, the solution often has a good convergence and the flow physics are being correctly calculated.
Figure 4 shows an overview of the Courant number along the mesh Re 200 and Re 10,000 cases. One can observe that the Courant number is close to 1 in most of the domain in both simulations, and there are a few spots of slightly higher values because of the higher velocities that occur due to the vortex shedding and the cylinder motion phenomena.

Simulation configurations
As said before, the cylinder is free to oscillate in the transverse direction of the flow and its movement is a result of transientlifting force acting on a mass-springdamper system. For the each Reynolds number a different set of spring and damping constants are applied, always keeping the same body mass. This different configuration represents different natural frequencies of vibration, and the response of each configuration will give distinct amplitude depending on how close the frequency of excitement (vortex shedding frequency) is to the natural frequency of the body. The relationship between the stream velocity and the natural frequency of the body is given by a dimensionless quantity called reduced velocity (equation 11).
The simulations were carried with many reduced velocity configurations, as shown in table 1, below.

Results
Simulations were carried out for a range of reduced velocities (Vr) using both CFX and Fluent solvers for the low-Re cases and Fluent for the Re 104 cases. Due to the large computational resources needed to perform the Re 104 cases, just one software package was selected.
The motion amplitudes captured in the simulations are reported as a dimensionless number, given by the ratio between the amplitude and the cylinder diameter. The results of the Re 200 numerical calculations can be seen in figure 5.
In Figure 6, the experimental results produced by Anagnostopoulos and Bearman (1992) with a similar Reynolds number (80~140), but with a different mass ratio and damping factor, are set out for comparison.
One can observe that even with slightly different Reynolds numbers, the maximum amplitudes of movement are fairly similar (around 0.6 diameters) and occur near the lock-in region (reduced velocity around 6). The velocity profiles of the vortex shedding can be seen in

Due to the satisfactory results obtained in the preliminary cases, all the methodology of mesh generation based on a boundary layer calculation and y+ estimation was used to generate the mesh for the cases with

Reynolds 10,000 and the time step calculation based on the vortex shedding emission was also used to determine the time-step value of those cases. It is intended to use a LES model as can be seen in the work of Breuer (1998).
The simulation results were also compared with experimental data achieved by Khalak and Williamson (1996). Figure 8 shows the response amplitude and figure 9 the

Conclusion
Due to lack of experimental results for low Reynolds problems, a detailed comparison between the experimental and simulation data was not possible: only the comparison of the maximum amplitudes could be used as a reference for the methodology testing.
The differences between the results obtained using Fluent and CFX in the low-Re cases can be explained by the different numerical methods used for each solver to calculate the flow and the mesh deformation, even though both packages solved the same group of equations with the same setup (same timestep, 2nd order discretization in time and space, etc.). The last calculated value of amplitude using Fluent, is far from the CFX results and those observed in experiments. In this study, this valuewas discarded and further investigation into the model must be undertaken to better understand what happened in this calculation.
Despite these uncertainties, we were encouraged to use the same methodology for the case with Reynolds number of 10000 and the Fluent solver was chosen based on previous experience regarding computational time. The amplitude results show very close agreement with the experimental data and the drag and lift coefficients show the same behavior as the experimental results, with some differences in values.
These differences are associated with the difficulty of the LES model to correctly predict the separation point due to the lack of wall and transition modeling in the LES formulation. Even with a mesh fine enough to calculate the flow near the wall, the phenomena of the boundary layer transition is very difficult to predict without a specific model and the Smagorinsky formulation treats equally the turbulence in both regions, near wall and far field. There are alternatives to this problem, for example, using Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) or Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) models, where it is possible to include a transition model in the k-o SST formulation with the cost of solving another set of equations.
