ABSTRACT

Botrychiopsis has been considered an important floristic element of Westphalian/Artinskian associations of

the Paraná Basin. The occurrence of Botrychiopsis in roof-shales of the Rio Bonito Formation in Southern

Paraná Basin (Quitéria area), supported by the identification of Botrychiopsis valida, enlarges the genus

biochron. Consequently, the stratigraphic hierarchy for Botrychiopsis plantiana and Botrychiopsis valida

was defined for the Paraná Basin. Although it is climatically controlled and related to a deglaciation icehouse

stage, stratigraphic distribution of the genus presents a substantial climate tolerance, from cold/cool to

warm/temperate conditions. A new phytostratigraphic zonation is proposed for the southern portion of the

basin that includes the Botrychiopsis Zone (Asselian/Kungurian), which is subdivided into the Botrychiopsis

plantiana (Asselian/Artinskian) and Botrychiopsis valida (Late Artinskian/Kungurian) subzones.

Key words: Botrychiopsis, biostratigraphy, Paraná Basin, Permian, palaeoclimatology, Gondwana.

INTRODUCTION

The intracratonic Paraná Basin covers 1.700.000

square kilometers of East and Central South

America (1.100.000 square kilometers in Brazil) and

encloses Paleozoic, Mesozoic and, locally, Ceno-

zoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks. According to

Milani et al. (1998), the Paraná Basin comprises

six stratigraphic megasequences bounded by interre-

gional unconformities (sensu Vail et al. 1977). The

three lower megasequences (Ordovician – Silurian,

Devonian and Carboniferous – Early Triassic) con-

sist of transgressive – regressive cycles whereas the

three upper megasequences (Late Triassic, Juras-

sic – Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous) encom-

pass continental strata and volcanic rocks. Each

megasequence corresponds to previously proposed

lithostratigraphic units.

The Carboniferous – Early Triassic (CET)

megasequence represents a second-order transgres-

sive – regressive cycle. It contains a basal transgres-

sive unit overlain by a regressive succession. The

basal succession includes the Itararé Group and Rio

Bonito and Palermo formations.

Botrychiopsis plantiana, recoverd from thick

sandstone and siltstone strata, was recorded in the

megafloras of the lower part of the Brazilian Gond-

wana succession, which comprises lowland glacio-

continental deposits of the Itararé Group (Millan

1975, 1979, Cazzulo-Klepzig and Guerra-Sommer

1983, Zampirolli 2001).

The synonymization of distinct taxa to this

morphogenus, which is characterized by heteromor-

phy, took place for more than a century (1844-1971)

during which several Earth Science paradigms were

established and abandoned, from the Fixist models

to Plate Tectonics. The main studies that produced

the current genus conception are presented in Fig. 1.

Studies of Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971)

demonstrated the biogeographic and biostrati-

graphic importance of the genus in Gondwana suc-

cessions. These sequences occur in Argentina

(Sessarego and Césari 1986, Archangelsky et al.

1987, Archangelsky and Cúneo 1987, Andreis and

Archangelsky 1996); Brazil (Millan 1975, 1979,

1987a,b, Rösler 1978, Guerra-Sommer and Caz-

zulo-Klepzig 1981, Guerra-Sommer and Cazzulo-

Klepzig 1993); South Africa (Rayner 1985, 1986,

Rayner and Coventry 1985, Anderson and Ander-

son 1985, Kovács-Endrödy 1991), India (Srivastava

1997) and Australia (Rigby 1973, 1993, Retallack

1980).

The paleofloristic assemblages show a homo-

geneous composition dominated by foliar organs of

plants with arborescent habit as well as remnant

shrub-like plants, such as Botrychiopsis plantiana.

Shrub-like plants identified as Botrychiopsis

plantiana have also been recorded in the southern-

most portion of the Paraná Basin, within the Glos-

sopteris Flora and are associated with fluvial, delta

and estuarine sedimentary rocks at the base of the

Rio Bonito Formation (Pasqualini et al. 1986).

The presence of Botrychiopsis in Paleozoic

Gondwana floras of the Paraná Basin has usually

been associated with tundra and taiga environments

(Archangelsky 1971, 1978, 1984, Rocha-Campos

and Archangelsky 1985, Retallack 1980, 1999).

In their description of the Glossopteris Flora

Early Permian evolution in Southern Brazil, Guerra-

Sommer et al. (1991, 2001) regarded Botrychiop-

sis plantiana as a remnant plant from a rigorous

periglacial cold climate.

The first records of Botrychiopsis within roof-

shales in Southern Paraná Basin (Quitéria area), as

discussed herein, allow to infer the relationship be-

tween the biostratigraphic distribution of this genus

and its tolerance to climate changes. In this case, cli-

mate change has been associated with a deglaciation

phase of an icehouse period and is represented by an

evolution from cool-temperate to warm-temperate

climate. The validation of this hypothesis would

then broaden the current parameters used to inter-

pret the climatic conditions favorable for the devel-

opment of these plants.

This paper comprises the first step of a larger

project that aims to evaluate the chronostratigraphic

significance of the Botrychiopsis within Gondwana.

It was carried out to verify earlier taxonomic and

biostratigraphic descriptions of Botrychiopsis forms

of the Southern Paraná Basin. This revision was re-

quired due to the reduced nature of previous descrip-

tions, which did not define the diagnostic differences

between previously identified and original material.

REVIEW OF THE Botrychiopsis OCCURENCE
IN SOUTHERN PARANÁ BASIN

Forms related to Botrychiopsis have been identified

in Rio Grande do Sul State in Faxinal, Base of Morro

Papaléo and Quitéria outcrops (Fig. 2).

The Faxinal outcrop, described by Morgenthal

et al. (1970) and later by Andreis et al. (1979), is

located in the northeastern portion of the Barão do

Triunfo topographic Sheet, close to the confluence

of the Grande and Faxinal creeks, about 10 km west-

northwestward from the Mariana Pimentel District.

The exposure includes variable amounts of

sandstone and mudstone related to the uppermost

part of the Itararé Group in the Rio Grande do Sul

State. It represents the westernmost exposure of a

paleovalley that extends from Potreiro Grande, 4 kM

eastwards from the Mariana Pimentel District.

Andreis et al. (1979) recognized two infor-

mal siltstone facies (white and grayish brown silt-

stone facies). Isolated Rubidgea-type leaves, Botry-

chiopsis fronds and small platispermic seeds rep-

resent most of the quantitatively poor megafloristic

association. Minor amounts of the Cordaites, Glos-

sopteris, Gangamopteris and Ginkgoites genera as

well as articulate stems and conifer branches are also

present.

According to Andreis et al. (1979) both white

and grayish brown facies represent the final filling

stage of large lakes, and considered then as related

to the end of the Itararé Group sedimentary cycle

(Corrêa da Silva 1970 and Bossi and Piccoli 1979).

According to Milani et al. (1998), these sedi-

ments correspond to lowland glaciocontinental sed-

iments, deposited during the deglaciation produced

by warming of a glacial climate.

The specimens hereby presented were previ-

ously studied by Guerra-Sommer et al. (1980) and

Cazzulo-Klepzig and Guerra-Sommer (1983) and

are stored (samples PB 3097 e PB 3098) in the Pale-

obotanic Sector of the Earth Sciences Institute of the

Federal University of the Rio Grande do Sul State

(UFRGS).

of long bipinnate fronds (3,9 to 8,2 cm long and

0,6 to 2,9 cm wide). They present a main robust

rachis, between 0,6 cm (proximal part) and 0,2 cm

(distal portion) wide, which features a solid longitu-

dinal nervure (Fig. 3b). From the widely decurrent

(Fig. 3e), separated (Fig. 3f) to slightly imbricated

(Fig. 3b) rachis, minor sessile pines displaying com-

plete limbus emanate with a somewhat acute angle

of insertion (50? a 70?). The pines outline is subcir-

cular and either smooth (Fig. 3f) or showing small

insertions (Fig. 3a,b, and d). These insertions origi-

nate their bipinnate aspect, with pines ranging from

oblong and rhomboidal at their base (Fig. 3e and f) to

oblong-elliptical or elliptical at their apex (Fig. 3a),

being 0,4 to 3,2 cm long and 1,1 to 1,4 cm wide.

These pines present an open venation, derived from

the rachis nervures, which is denser at its base and

that disperses along the pinnules (Fig. 3a,b,c and

d). As the nervures go along the pinnules they suf-

fer dichotomy, which can occur twice or four times

(Fig. 3a). Pinnules are strongly decurrent and the

more developed ones are free down to their base and

may present an asymmetrical, subcircular to slightly

oblong outline.

The associated microflora, composed of trilete

spores (75%) and monosaccate pollen (15%), rare

bisaccate and striate pollens, was related by An-

dreis et al. (1979) to the H1/H2 biostratigraphic

interval of Daemon and Quadros (1970). It cor-

responds to the upper part of the Potonieisporites-

Lundbladispora Zone proposed by Archangel-

sky and Marques-Toigo (1978) for the Chaco-

Paraná Basin (Argentina). According to Andreis et

al. (1979), this interval is equivalent to either the

Stephanian C – Sakmarian boundary or, according

to Faddeieva (1976), to the base of the Asselian in

Russia.

The outcrop Base Morro Papaléo is situated in

the Barão do Triunfo topographic sheet (SH-22-0-1-

2), 8 Km northwestward of Mariana Pimentel. It is

located in a ravine on the lower part of the southwest-

ern border of the Morro Papaléo (UTM 0438317 E

and 6647584 N).

This outcrop, described by Pasqualini et al.

(1986), comprises an alternation of carbonaceous,

fossiliferous siltstone, mica-rich, fine-grained sand-

stone, lenticular, coarse-grained sandstone and con-

glomerate, and sandstone exhibiting iron-rich con-

cretions. Plane bedded siltstone and sandstone and

cross-bedded sandstone are common sedimentary

features.

Pasqualini et al. (1986) related the fossiliferous

beds to the bottom of efemerous water bodies asso-

ciated with the margins of interdistributary lakes.

The taphoflora is mostly composed of glos-

sopterids with pinnate venation (Glossopteris com-

munis, Glossopteris indica) and Botrychiopsis plan-

tiana associated with articulates (Phylloteca indica)

and conifers (Buriadia isophylla). Gangamopteris

sp., Glossopteris angustifolia, Cordaites and pro-

toglossopterids (Rubidgea obovata) occur as minor

elements.

Some specimens formerly described by Pas-

qualini et al. (1986) were analyzed herein, as well

as others stored in the Paleobotanic Sector of the

Earth Science Institute at UFRGS.

The samples comprise basal and medial-basal

fragments of elongated and bipinnate fronds (3,8

to 9,0 cm long and 0,6 to 7,9 cm wide). They

present a robust main rachis, with strong longitu-

dinal nervures, which can be 0,9 cm wide at its

proximal portion and disperse at the more distal

pines (Fig. 3b). In a subordinate way, and show-

ing somewhat acute insertion angles (50? to 70?),

sessile, widely decurrent to pseudopetiolate pines

emanate from the rachis. They change from iso-

lated to slightly imbricated, show complete limbus,

and can either present or lack insertions on their bor-

ders, therefore producing their bipinnate aspect.

The pines from the basal portions of the fronds

are decurrent and separated (Fig. 3e) to fairly im-

bricated (Fig. 3b). They can present rhomboidal

(Fig. 3e), rhomboidal-ovoid (Fig. 3f) or rhomboidal-

elongated (Fig. 3b) outlines with no insertions. They

are 0,8–1,8 cm long and 1,3–1,8 cm wide. These

pines present an open venation, derived from the

rachis nervures, which is denser at its base, disperses

at the apex and can dichotomize twice to three times.

The pines from the medial-basal portions of the

fronds are rather imbricated and change from exten-

sively decurrent to pseudopetiolate. They present ei-

ther an elliptical-elongated or oblong-elliptical out-

line that can display slight to strong insertions on

their borders. In this latter case a bipinnate mor-

phology is produced and the lobes correspond to

the pinnules. The pine length spans from 0,7 to 5,4

cm and their width between 0,9 and 2,8 cm. They

present an open venation, derived from the rachis

nervures, which is denser at its base and more dis-

perse along the pinnules. As the nervures go along

the pinnules they suffer dichotomy, from twice to

four times. The pinnules are strongly decurrent and

the more developed ones are free down to their base.

They always present an asymmetrical outline that

can be subcircular to slightly oblong (Fig. 3).

One of the samples (PB 2575), previously de-

scribed by Guerra-Sommer et al. (1986), presents

the central axis of the plant perpendicularly posi-

tioned relative to the bedding planes and from which

four fronds radiate (3,3 cm long and 1,8 cm wide)

and a rachis (0,6 cm wide) with strong longitudinal

nervures. From the rachis subaltern, separated, ses-

sile, extensively decurrent pines emanate, exhibiting

entire limbus, slightly acute insertion angles (50? a

70?) and a reniform morphology. These pines are

0.6 cm long and 1.3 cm wide and show venation

derived for the rachis nervures. Venation is open,

denser at its base (dispersing towards the apex) and

can dichotomize twice to three times.

Samples from Base of Morro do Papaléo lack

spores and pollen probably due to non-preservation.

The Quitéria outcrop is located in the Pan-

tano Grande County (Rio Grande do Sul State), in

the southeastern border of the Paraná Basin (UTM

0387516 E and 6643183 N). It is about 130 km from

Porto Alegre, along the BR 290 freeway, and can be

localized in the Quitéria topographic sheet (SH22-

NH). It comprises a sedimentary package about 8

meters thick, characterized by the intercalation of

carbonaceous shale, argillite, fine- to coarse-grained

sandstone, matrix-supported (silty to sandy) con-

glomerate and thin, up to 25 cm thick coal beds.

The fronds are preserved in a light-yellow, fine-

grained sandstone bed (45 cm thick) that exhibits

plane bedding and is situated immediately above a

carbonaceous argillite bed. Both horizontal and in-

situ lycophyte stems (Brasilodendron) occur in as-

sociation with this level, as well as Coniferophyta,

Cordaites, Filicophyta and scattered fragments of

glossopterids (Rubidgea sp. and Glossopteris sp.).

Piccoli et al. (1991) related the sedimentary

succession to a delta system dominated by low-

energy fluvial processes, with well-developed allu-

vial plain facies and peat-forming swamps in the

interdistributary lowlands.

Based on specific features, mostly those re-

lated to lycophyte specimens of the Brasilodendron

genus, and previous regional stratigraphic studies

(Menezes 1994, Chaves et al. 1994, Della Fávera et

al. 1994, Holz 1995, Lopes and Lavina 1995, Holz

1997) Jasper and Guerra-Sommer (1999) suggested

a barrier-lagoon system (and associated washover

fans), similar to the model formulated by Reison

(1992).

The samples are stored in the Botany and Pa-

leobotany Sector of the UNIVATES Natural Sci-

ences Museum and in the Paleobotany Sector of the

DPE/UFRGS.

The samples from Quitéria include basal and

medial-basal fragments of elliptical, elongated and

bipinnate fronds (3,5 to 11,6 cm long and 0,4 to

5,1 cm wide). They present a robust main rachis

(0,1 to 0,9 cm thick) that encompasses strong lon-

gitudinal nervures (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5a) from which

sessile pines in a sub-opposite trend emanate with

slightly acute insertion angles (60? to 80?). These

pines are decurrent to extensively decurrent, sepa-

rated to slightly imbricated, and present complete

limbus, with (bipinnate morphology) or without in-

sertions on their borders.

The pines of the frond basal portions are widely

decurrent and either separated (Fig. 4b and d and

Fig. 5c) or slightly imbricated (Fig. 4a and c and

Fig. 5a). They present a rhomboidal (Fig. 4d and

Fig. 5c), rhomboidal-elongated (Fig. 4c and Fig. 5a),

rhomboidal-widened (Fig. 4a) or reniform outline

(Fig. 4b and Fig. 5b) on which insertions are some-

times observable (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Pines are 0,4

to 1,1 cm long and 0,8 to 2,5 cm wide. Pine ve-

nation, derived from the rachis nervures, is open,

denser towards its base and disperse at its apex, and

dichotomize twice to four times (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6).

The pines of the medial-basal portions of the

fronds are slightly imbricated and vary from de-

current (Fig. 6b) to extensively decurrent (Fig. 6a).

They present an elliptical or elliptical-elongated out-

line and can present insertions (bipinnate morphol-

ogy) on their borders (Fig. 6d). Their lengths vary

from 0,5 to 5,0 cm and their width from 0,7 to 2,8 cm.

These pines display an open venation, derived from

the rachis nervures, which is denser at its basal and

central portions and disperses along the pinnules. As

the nervures go along the pinnules they dichotomize

twice to four times (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). Pinnules are

strongly decurrent and the more developed ones are

free down to their base, presenting a subcircular to

elliptical-elongated outline.

Apiculatisporis, Granulatisporites, Cyclogranis-

porites and Convolutispora genera.

Monosaccate pollen (Plicatipollenites, Cahe-

niasaccites, Potonieisporites and Cannanoropollis

genera) is less common and indicates the occur-

rence of Cordaitophyta. On the other hand, bisac-

cate pollen, such as Scheuringipollenites, Vesicas-

pora and Limitisporites, is related to Glossopterido-

phyta.

The identified striated pollen specimens have a

botanical affinity with Coniferophyta, such as Proto-

haploxypinus, Vittatina and Lunatisporites. Mono-

lete spores are rare and essentially represented by

forms of Cycadopites.

Due to the predominance of species related to

Zonati and Cingulicavati spores the palynoflora is

comparable, in the Paraná Basin, to the microfloris-

tic association identified in the Candiota Superior

and Banco Louco beds in the Candiota Coalfield by

Meyer (1999).

Among the spore-pollinnic associations pro-

posed by Marques-Toigo and Corrêa da Silva (1984)

for the coal measures of the Rio Grande do Sul State,

this type of palynoflora is comparable to the Pun-

tatisporites, Lundbladispora and Portalites Associ-

ation, which is related to plants of hydrophylous to

hygrophilous environments.

In terms of biostratigraphy, the microflora

identified in the Candiota Upper Coal Seams was

included in the Caheniasaccites ovatus Zone of Mar-

ques-Toigo (1988) – Artinskian/Kungurian. Based

on isotopic dating of tonstein beds interbedded in

the coal seams, Cazzulo-Klepzig (2001) linked this

zone to Late Kungurian/Early Roadian age.

Palynological analyses on samples from Quité-

ria confirm its correspondance with the Caheniasac-

cites ovatus biozone (Kungurian/Early Roadian).

TAXONOMIC AFFINITIES

In this chapter, the taxonomic affinities of the previ-

ously described material (Faxinal, base of the Morro

Papaléo and Quitéria) are re-evaluated.

The morphological features of the studied spe-

cimens indicate affinities with the Eusphenopteris

Novik (1947) and Botrychiopsis (Kurtz) Archangel-

sky and Arrondo (1971).

The Eusphenopteris Novik (1947) genus is

characterized by a bipinnate frond, with alate

rachis and alternated pines. These pines show a

poorly defined rachis as the pinnule limbus presents

decurrent spreading. Pinnules are trilobate and

deeply incised, with an open, dichotomized vena-

tion that arises from a central nervure starting from

the rachis. Within Carboniferous Gondwana succes-

sions these forms have been considered intermediate

between Botrychiopsis and Dactylophylum (Zam-

pirolli 2001). In Western Gondwana this genus was

recorded by Cúneo (1990), in the Mojón de Hierro

Formation (Upper Paleozoic Tepuel Group), Arroyo

Garrido area (Chubut Province of Argentina). It was

also found by Zampirolli (2001), in the Santa Marta

Farm (Itapeva region in the São Paulo State), within

Neo-Carboniferous interglacial rocks (Itararé Sub-

group of the Paraná Basin).

Based on previous studies (Archangelsky

Iannuzzi 1994, Ricardi 1994, Iannuzzi et al. 1998),

Iannuzzi and Rösler (2000) have stated that the

Eusphenopteris genus was a rare component of the

Archeosigillaria/ Lepidondrops/ Frenguellia, Euro-

american and Northern Rhacopteris Nothorha-

copteris floras, although common in the Southern

Nothorhachopteris Flora, during the Carboniferous.

Among the main features of the Eusphenopteris

genus are its tripinnate frond with trilobate pinnules,

deeply incised margins and subtriangular outline,

showing an open and dichotomized venation that

arises from a single and thick nervure going into

the pinnules from the rachis. Although presenting

an open and dichotomized venation in the pinnules,

the studied material does not show all other features

of the Eusphenopteris genus.

The morphology of the analyzed material

points towards the Botrychiopsis (Kurtz) Archan-

gelsky and Arrondo (1971).

logical and taxonomic data, but also stratigraphic

implications, was presented by Archangelsky and

Arrondo (1971). The authors, based on Argentinean

material and relating it to Gondwana and extra-

Gondwana data, confirmed Kurtz’s (1895a, b) orig-

inal interpretations. A new diagnosis was defined

and the concepts of frond, pines and pinnules were

reviewed. Furthermore, descriptive features diag-

nostic of the following three species were presented:

Botrychiopsis weissiana (Kurtz) Archangelsky and

Arrondo (1971), Botrychiopsis plantiana (Carru-

thers) Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971) and Botry-

chiopsis valida (Feistmantel) Archangelsky and Ar-

rondo (1971), the latter only compared with the Up-

per Paleozoic of India. According to Archangelsky

and Arrondo (1971) the different species present a

wide geographic distribution and clear chronostrati-

graphic boundaries that allow some phylogenetic as-

sumptions in terms of an ascendancy of Botrychiop-

sis weissiana in relation to Botrychiopsis plantiana,

and of this one to Botrychiopsis valida.

Cúneo (1990) confirms the genus features

pointing out that the pines are arranged in a slightly

subopposite way, with a rachis that goes to the base

of the apical pinnule. Furthermore, pines are lobate

with deccurent insertions, its venation is open and

can be dichotomized up to three times.

In this study, both generic and specific propo-

sitions of Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971) are ac-

cepted. A pteridophytic or pteridospermic affinity

has been proposed for this genus.

Considering the original diagnosis of Kurtz

(1895a,b), emended by Archangelsky and Arrondo

(1971), Botrychiopsis weissiana presents some fea-

tures that were not seen in the studied samples of the

Faxinal and Base of Morro Papaléo outcrops. The

morphological characters of Botrychiopsis weis-

siana include an alate basal portion of the frond, a

twisted insertion of the pines with a pronounced im-

brication, and an ovoid-spatulated morphology of

the frond apical pinnule.

Similarly, it is not possible to correlate the stud-

ied samples with Botrychiopsis valida. In Feist-

mantel’s (1879) previous description, also emended

by Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971), this species

presents divided basal frond pinnules, confluent

along the entire frond and presenting subrhombic

morphology with sinuous margins. These charac-

teristics are not present in the studied samples.

The main morphological features of this mate-

rial are apical, medial and medial-basal fragments

of the pines. The pines have long and bipinnate

fronds presenting a robust main rachis that can dis-

perse in the distal pines. The rachis presents strong

longitudinal nervures from which minor sessile pin-

nules radiate displaying slightly acute insertion an-

gles (50? to 70?). The pinnules are generally decur-

rent to pseudopetiolate, separated to slightly imbri-

cated, presenting entire limbus with or without inser-

tions on their borders. They may assume a sublobate

morphology, from rhomboidal, rhomboidal-ovaled

or rhomboidal-elongated to elliptical, elliptical-

elongated or oblong-elliptical morphology. They

present an open venation derived from the rachis

nervures, which is denser at their base and disperse

along their limbus, which can dichotomize twice

to four times. These elements link this material

to Botrychiopsis plantiana (Archangelsky and Ar-

rondo 1971).

This conclusion is reinforced by comparative

analysis of the samples discussed herein and the

specimens shown by Archangelsky and Arrondo

(1971, Slide V, Fig. 1 and 2, Slide VI, Fig. 1, 2 and

3) and their diagnoses.

This review also confirms the designations of

Guerra-Sommer et al. (1980), Cazzulo-Klepzig and

Guerra-Sommer (1983) and Pasqualini et al. (1986).

Botrychiopsis valida

The Quitéria frond samples were not correlated to

Botrychiopsis weissiana due to the lack of some crit-

ical morphological features, such as the basal por-

tion of the alate frond, the twisted insertion of the

pines displaying heavily delineated imbrication and

the ovoid-spatulated morphology of the frond apical

pinnules.

On the other hand, the Quitéria forms can not

be associated with Botrychiopsis plantiana due to

An Acad Bras Cienc (2003) 75 (4)



Botrychiopsis AND ITS BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC IMPLICATIONS IN SOUTHERN PARANÁ BASIN 525

the absence of characteristics such as the connected

to slightly imbricate pinnules of the frond base and

the spatulate shape with the rounded distal margin

of the apical pinnules.

However, these specimens can be correlated to

another species, Botrychiopsis valida, taking into

account the material described by Feistmantel

(1880), Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971), Rigby

(1973), Anderson and Anderson (1985) Gould

(1975), Retallack (1980), Rayner (1995), Rigby

(1985) and Archangelsky and Cúneo (1981).

The pines and pinnules morphology along the

fronds supports the identification of the Quitéria ma-

terial with Botrychiopsis valida. Among the main

features used for its identification the presence of a

robust and well-defined main rachis can be consid-

ered, with solid longitudinal nervures, from which

subopposite sessile pinnules emanate with slightly

acute insertion angles (60? to 80?). These pinnules

are extensively decurrent to decurrent, separated to

slightly imbricated, and have entire limbus present-

ing, or not, insertions on their borders.

Furthermore, the decurrent aspect of the sepa-

rated basal pines, with rhomboidal, elongate-

rhomboidal or reniform outline, are very similar

to the material previously related to Botrychiopsis

plantiana by Gould (1975, Fig. 3C and D) and later

on to Botrychiopsis valida by Retallack (1980).

Some other aspects also evidence the associa-

tion of the specimen hereby analyzed to Botrychiop-

sis valida, largely by comparison with the mate-

rial described and synonymized by Archangelsky

and Arrondo (1971) as well as that identified by

Rigby (1973), Anderson and Anderson (1985),

Gould (1975), Retallack (1980) and Rayner (1995).

Among these evidences, the presence of slightly

imbricate, highly decurrent to decurrent pinnules

with elliptical or elongated-elliptical outline and

sub-lobate border insertions was observed. The pin-

nules present an open venation, derived from the

rachis nervures, denser at their basal and central

portions and dispersing along the upper portions of

the pinnules, which dichotomize twice to four times

(similar to the basal pinnules).

Botrychiopsis valida was previously described

as Neuropteris valida by Feistmantel (1876) within

Eopermian sedimentary successions of India. Later,

Feistmantel (1879, 1880) again mentioned the same

species, also within Indian sedimentary rocks.

Gothan (1927) registered the presence of Gondwani-

dium validum in the Serra de los Llanos (Argentina).

Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971) synonymized all

these specimens to Botrychiopsis valida, stressing

that this species was restricted to India. In their spe-

cific description, Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971)

highlight that the frond base presents well-defined,

subcircular to slightly elongated and clearly sepa-

rated pinnules with a large insertion base. The pines

present normal insertions and vary from slightly im-

bricate to united. The highest number of pinnules

per pine (up to 5 cm long) is five. The usual in-

sertion angles range from 70? to 80?. All pinnules

are convergent, the apical ones presenting a sub-

rhombic morphology with sinuous margins. Ac-

cording to Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971), an-

other important aspect of this species is the pres-

ence in the medial portions of the frond of just pro-

duced pines. These pines present fused pinnules

at their base and free ones at their apical portions.

Similar features are reported by Anderson and An-

derson (1985, pl. 167, Fig. 2) and can be seen in

the material presented herein. However, Retallack

(1980) considered the designation of Botrychiop-

sis valida, defended by Archangelsky and Arrondo

(1971), as nomen vanum and sinonymized to Botry-

chiopsis ovata (Mc’Coy). Retallack (1980) also

states that the specimen classified as Botrychiop-

sis plantiana by Gould (1975, Fig. 3C, D) should

also correspond to the Botrychiopsis ovata species.

Later, Rigby (1985) suggests, keeping the Botry-

chiopsis ovata species, including in this species

other taxa such as Otopteris ovata Mc’Coy (1847,

p. 148; pl. IX, Fig. 2), Aneimites austrina Etheridge

(1888, p. 1304; pl. 37), Cardiopteris polymorpha in

White (1969a,b; p. 98; plates A and B, Fig. 1), Gond-

wanidium plantianum in Rigby (1973, p. 4-5; plate

1, Fig. 2 and plate 2 Fig. 3), Triphyllopteris austrina

in Morris (1975, p. 104; pl. 8.1c, Fig. 8.1 and 8.4

Even so, in this paper the designation Botry-

chiopsis valida is maintained in accordance with

Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971) criteria.

THE BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC IMPLICATIONS
OF THE Botrychiopsis GENUS IN

SOUTHERN PARANÁ BASIN

The Botrychiopsis genus was proposed by Kurtz

(1895a,b), based on Carboniferous material of the

Rio Jejenes Formation (San Juan Province, Argen-

tina). Similar forms, previously recorded by Fren-

güelli (1944, 1946, 1954) under other denomina-

tions, were identified by Archangelsky and Arrondo

(1971) as Botrychiopsis weissiana.

According to Archangelsky and Arrondo

(1971), the description of distinct biocrons for the

species of the Botrychiopsis genus highlights not just

its phylogenetic relationship but also its chronos-

tratigraphic importance. The phylogenetic associ-

ations come from the Botrychiopsis weissiana and

Botrychiopsis plantiana sequential record within

Argentinean Gondwana associations. Forms related

to Botrychiopsis valida would also be descended

from Botrychiopsis weissiana developed in distant

areas, hence differentiating from the Western Gond-

wana coeval forms. Based on these evidences and

the inferences of Gothan and Sahni (1937), it seems

that the group development occurred from an ances-

tral stock identified in Peninsular India and Australia

Namurian successions.

However, some aspects of this evidence, such

as the presence of Botrychiopsis weissiana and

Botrychiopsis plantiana as coeval elements within

Argentinean Paleozoic floras (Archangelsky and

Azcuy 1985), suggest the need of re-evaluating pre-

supposed phylogenetic relations. Although these

data support the idea that the specific relations

should be reviewed, studies on distinct basins have

confirmed the stratigraphic importance of the differ-

ent morpho-species.

In a first inference to the Botrychiopsis

chronostratigraphic impact Archangelsky and Ar-

rondo (1971) indicated a time span from Upper Car-

boniferous (Westphalian) to Lower Permian (Artin-

skian) for the genus. The Botrychiopsis weissiana

biochron was restricted to the Carboniferous Sys-

tem (Tupense local age – Westphalian/Stephanian

of Western Europe). This geochronological posi-

tion was corroborated by marine invertebrates (An-

telo 1972) and palynology (Menéndez 1965).

Botrychiopsis plantiana is linked to the earliest

Conifers and Ginkgoales occurrences in the Tram-

peadero and Libertad formations (Paganzo Basin),

in Upper Carboniferous sequences of Trampead-

erense local age.

The record of Botrychiopsis plantiana in the

Nueva Lubecka Formation, referred to the Lube-

kense A/B (Sakmarian/Artinskian), according to pa-

lynological and marine invertebrates (Antelo 1972),

is considered as a Carboniferous relict.

Archangelsky and Arrondo (1971) considered

Botrychiopsis valida as exclusive to Indian succes-

sions (Kaharbari Formation). The age interval was

attributed to the Artinskian through the analysis of

marine invertebrates (Robison 1967), hence com-

prising the youngest species of the genus (Archan-

gelsky and Arrondo 1971).

In the Paraná Basin, Carruthers (1869) regis-

tered Botrychiopsis plantiana in coal-bearing strata,

later named Odontopteris plantiana. White (1908)

and Lundqvist (1919) designated the same form with

the epithet Neuropteridium plantianun. Dolianiti

(1948) named similar species found in the Itararé

Group of the Rio Grande do Sul State (Acampa-

mento Velho outcrop) as Gondwanidium plan-

tianum.

In an attempt to characterize a Pre-Glossop-

teris Flora for Upper Paleozoic successions of the

Northern Paraná Basin (Monte Mor outcrop – Itararé

Group, São Paulo State), Millan (1975, 1979)

pointed out Botrychiopsis plantiana as the diagnos-

tic element. A Westphalian/Stephanian age was pro-

posed for the succession based on palynological data

(Trindade 1970). According to Iannuzzi (pess.

comm. 2002), however, from the analysis of the

An Acad Bras Cienc (2003) 75 (4)



Botrychiopsis AND ITS BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC IMPLICATIONS IN SOUTHERN PARANÁ BASIN 527

available type-material studied by Millan (1975,

1979), which is now kept in the Museu Nacional

(UFRJ), it is impossible to establish the specific

affinity of the material. Therefore, the specimens de-

scribed by Millan (1975, 1979) remain here termed

Botrychiopsis sp.

On the informal phytostratigraphic zonation

of the Late Paleozoic Paraná Basin, Rösler (1978)

recorded the presence of Botrychiopsis plantiana

in Taphoflora A, relating it to the early stages of

deglaciation in the Paraná Basin (Sakmarian/

Artinskian). Andreis and Archangelsky (1996), in a

review of the Neopaleozoic basins of South Amer-

ica, related the Taphoflora A to a probable Stepha-

nian age, taking into account the lack of the Glos-

sopteris genus. According to Guerra-Sommer and

Cazzulo-Klepzig (1981) the Itararé Group tapho-

flora in the Rio Grande do Sul State, including Botry-

chiopsis plantiana, can be related to the Cerquilho

(Taphoflora A and B of Rösler 1978) and Argen-

tinean Bajo de Veliz (Lubekense A) taphoflora.

Studies of Millan (1987a) on the megafloris-

tic association of coal-bearing strata from Itapeva

(São Paulo State) – the Santa Marta Flora of the

Itararé Group – record a large amount of Botrychiop-

sis plantiana fronds and subordinate Sphenopsida

(Paracalamites, Sphenophyllum), Cordaitales (Cor-

daites) and platispermics seeds (Cordaicarpus). An

Itapevense local age was indicated for this associa-

tion.

In an attempt to define floristic stages for coal-

beds of the Itararé Group, Millan (1987b) correlated

the Monte Mor Taphoflora (Montemorense Stage)

to the Trampeaderense Megafloristic Zone of

the Argentinean Paganzo Basin (Azcuy and Jelin

1980). This taphoflora is regarded as Westphalian/

Stephanian and correlated to the Potonieisporites-

Lundbladispora Zone (Archangelsky and Césari

1986). According to Millan (1987b), Botrychiopsis

plantiana is the leading element of the Itapevense

Sub-Stage (Itapeva Flora). A Stephanian age for the

Itapevense Sub-Stage was estimated by correlation

with palynological data (Lima et al. 1976).

Zampirolli (2001) carried out a detailed review

of the formerly described Santa Marta Taphoflora

(Millan 1987a), using the same material that is now

stored in the National Museum (Universidade Fed-

eral do Rio de Janeiro). In this review, in addition to

Botrychiopsis, other important diagnostic elements

have been included, such as Sphenopteris sp. and

Nothorhacopteris cf. argentinica. Palynological

data from the same strata are comparable with the

Ahrensisporites cristatus Interval Zone of the Itararé

Group lower portion (Zampirolli et al. 2000, Souza

2000). Taking in account mega- and microfloristic

data, Zampirolli (2001) estimated a Westphalian age

for the Santa Marta Flora. According to Zampirolli

(2001) this association is comparable to the NBG

Zone of Argentina (Middle to Late Carboniferous

– Tupense – according to Archangelsky and Cúneo

1991).

In a study on the biostratigraphic importance of

the upper Paleozoic taphofloras in Southern Paraná

Basin, Guerra-Sommer and Cazzulo-Klepzig (1993)

characterized some morphogenera as very impor-

tant in terms of dating and correlation. In their at-

tempt to establish paleofloristic associations based

on observable boundaries of lithostratigraphic units,

Botrychiopsis plantiana (recorded in the Faxinal and

Francisquinho outcrops by Andreis et al. 1979) was

regarded as one of the main elements related to the

interval of deposition of the Itararé sequences in the

Rio Grande do Sul State (Sakmarian).

Botrychiopsis plantiana remains a significant

component of the Eopermian Glossopteris flora,

then associated with Glossopteris, Gangamopteris,

Phyllotheca, Buriadia (Pasqualini et al. 1986),

which was related by Guerra-Sommer et al. (1986)

to the basal sequences of the Rio Bonito Formation.

In a preliminary biozoning of the South-

ern Paraná Basin (Guerra-Sommer and Cazzulo-

Klepzig 1993) the Botrychiopsis plantiana Zone was

identified (Itararé Group and base of the Rio Bonito

Formation) and related to the Sakmarian-Artinskian.

The main feature of the lower subzone (Gang-

amopteris angustifolia) is the predominance of

Botrychiopsis plantiana associated with protoglos-

sopterids (Rubidgea obovata and Rubidgea lancio-

latus) and the first glossopterids, mostly represented

by Gangamopteris (Gangamopteris obovata, Gang-

amopteris buriadica and Gangamopteris angusti-

folia). Glossopteris (Glossopteris communis and

Glossopteris indica) occur as complementary ele-

ments. The Phyllotheca indica Subzone comprises

elements related to articulate (Phyllotheca indica)

associated with Glossopteris (Glossopteris commu-

nis) and Conifers (Buriadia isophylla).

Recent data have shown that paleofloristic evo-

lution in the Southern Paraná Basin during deposi-

tion of the Carboniferous – Early Triassic Megase-

quence was closely related to palaeoclimate, in addi-

tion to biostratigraphic and paleoecological controls

(Guerra-Sommer et al. 2001). This assumption was

confirmed by the evaluation of taphofloristic param-

eters from different biostratigraphic units.

The homogeneous composition of Early Per-

mian (Sakmarian) wet lowland biomes, character-

ized by the Glossopteris flora and herbaceous to

shrub-like plants considered to be relicts from a rig-

orous cold climate (e.g. Botrychiopsis plantiana),

suggests the persistence of an ice age. The progres-

sive colonization of the lowland clastic habitats by

Cordaitales, Ginkgoales, Coniferales, in addition to

the herbaceous articulates, indicates an Early Artin-

skian climate warming.

Glossopterids with pinnate venation and re-

lated to Glossopteris are common in Early Per-

mian coal-bearing strata (Artinskian/Kungurian)

whereas Gangamopteris (palmate form) is poorly

represented. The sudden enrichment of filicoid

fronds is characteristic of the landscape units in this

stage. Arborescent lycophyte communities become

important, associated with glossopterid-dominated

communities. This event coincides with the wan-

ing of the Permian icehouse stage, which reached

its peak around the Asselian/Sakmarian boundary.

The record of Botrychiopsis valida within coal-

bearing megafloras in the Southern Paraná Basin,

associated with Glossopterids (Glossopteris, Gang-

amopteris and Rubidgea), Filicophyta (Rhodeop-

teridium?), Conifers (Buriadia and Ferruglio-

cladus?) and arborescent Lycophyta (Brasiloden-

dron pedroanum), as presented herein, indicates a

larger biogeographic distribution range of this genus

in the Gondwana.

CONCLUSIONS

Botrychiopsis has been considered an impor-

tant floristic element of Westphalian/Artinskian as-

sociations of the Paraná Basin. In the Southern

Paraná Basin, several authors have related its oc-

currence to glacial-influenced environments. This

genus has been recorded within associations related

to a Permian glacier retreat (icehouse stage – As-

selian/Kungurian). During the early deglaciation

phases (cold/cool temperate climate), the Glos-

sopteris Flora, linked to wet biomes, changed gradu-

ally. However, during the latest deglaciation stages,

when a fast transition took place in the wet biomes

due to warming (warm temperate climate), in asso-

ciation with peat formation, the Botrychiopsis genus

persisted, then represented by Botrychiopsis valida.

In the phytostratigraphie scheme presented by

Guerra-Sommer and Cazzulo-Klepzig (1993), the

Botrychiopsis plantiana Zone ranges from Sakmar-

ian to Artinskian.

The new data here presented enlarge the Botry-

chiopsis genus biochron and define a stratigraphic

hierarchy between Botrychiopsis plantiana and

Botrychiopsis valida. In the Southern Paraná Basin,

Botrychiopsis plantiana is restricted to Asselian/

Artinskian and Botrychiopsis valida to Kungurian.

It is also reported that the stratigraphic range of the

Botrychiopsis genus in Southern Paraná Basin is re-

lated to a deglaciation stage (icehouse) and, there-

fore, to a wide climate range, from cold/cool tem-

perate to warm temperate. Megafloristic association

in biomes cold-cool, cool and warm-temperate cli-

mates were identified, in the Lower and Midle/

Upper Permian in Southernwest Paraná Basin (Fig. 7

and 8).

A new phytostratigraphic scheme is proposed.

It includes an Asselian/Artinskian Botrychiopsis

Zone encompassing the Asselian/Artinskian Botry-

chiopsis plantiana and the upper Artinskian/

Kungurian Botrychiopsis valida subzones (Fig. 9).

The Faxinal microflora associated with the

Botrychiopsis plantiana Subzone suggests a Stepha-

nian C/Sakmarian or lower Asselian age. The Qui-

téria microflora on the other hand, is related to the

Caheniasaccites ovatus Zone (Kungurian to lower

Roadian).
