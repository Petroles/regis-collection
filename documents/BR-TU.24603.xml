Resumo alargado 

 

O sucesso do tratamento eletroquímico de águas residuais depende de um grande número de 

fatores; em particular, da natureza do material do elétrodo, que influencia fortemente a 

eficiência do processo. 

Os materiais de elétrodo são claramente um dos parâmetros mais importantes na otimização 

dos processos eletroquímicos. A opção por um determinado material de elétrodo é feita em 

função da sua zona útil de potencial na solução a utilizar. Esta zona de potenciais está limitada 

por diversos fatores, como a estabilidade estrutural, mecânica, química e eletroquímica do 

material de elétrodo, a formação na sua superfície de uma camada de uma substância isoladora 

(passivação), a decomposição do eletrólito suporte, etc. A durabilidade do elétrodo nas 

condições de trabalho, assim como o seu custo, são igualmente parâmetros a ter em conta. O 

material de elétrodo ideal para a degradação de poluentes orgânicos deve exibir alta atividade 

para a oxidação e baixa atividade perante as reações secundárias (por exemplo, evolução de 

oxigénio).   

Este trabalho consistiu na preparação de filmes de SnO2-SbOx que sejam estrutural, química, 

mecânica e electroquimicamente estáveis; estes materiais devem ainda ter tempos de vida útil 

prolongados, de modo a que possam vir a ser utilizados exaustivamente na degradação de 

contaminantes, reduzindo assim o seu custo. 

Ao longo deste trabalho, foram preparados diferentes filmes de óxidos mistos de estanho e 

antimónio. Um dos métodos utilizado foi a eletrodeposição em camadas alternadas de estanho 

e antimónio sobre um substrato. Foram testadas deposições diretas sobre o substrato de titânio 

ou sobre uma camada intermédia de platina ou de cobre. Estas deposições intermédias têm 

como objetivo otimizar o tempo de vida útil do filme de óxidos.  

De seguida, e com o objetivo de obter filmes mais finos e uniformes, testou-se a 

eletrodeposição simultânea de Sn e Sb, tendo utilizado substratos idênticos: Ti; Ti/Pt; Ti/Cu. 

Deste modo, foram preparadas vários materiais de elétrodos com base em filmes de óxidos de 

estanho e antimónio, usando os dois métodos de eletrodeposição diferentes e com diferentes 

camadas intermédias. Para todos os materiais preparados foi realizada a caracterização 

estrutural, morfológica e eletroquímica do elétrodo, recorrendo-se a várias técnicas, como 

difração de raios X, microscopia eletrónica de varrimento e voltametria cíclica. 

Com estes filmes de óxidos, após a caracterização usual, foi efetuado um estudo sobre a reação 

de evolução de oxigénio, tendo-se determinado a energia de ativação aparente da oxidação da 

água em cada um dos diferentes materiais. Conclui-se ainda que o fator de rugosidade 

influencia profundamente a reação de evolução de oxigénio, pois o material com fator de 

rugosidade superior apresenta menor energia de ativação aparente para a evolução do oxigénio.  

Os materiais preparados sobre substratos contendo uma camada intermédia de cobre 

mostraram ter apetência para a evolução do oxigénio, não podendo contudo ser usados na 



 viii 

degradação de poluentes orgânicos, pois este processo requer potenciais mais elevados, onde 

se dá a oxidação do cobre e a desativação do elétrodo. 

O elétrodo Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb que apresentava boas características para ser utilizado em eletro-

oxidação, foi utilizado na degradação de soluções de 100 mg L-1 de diclofenac, tendo-se obtido 

remoções de carga poluente de cerca de 50% ao fim de 6 h de ensaio. Para além disso, o material 

manteve-se e com resultados reprodutíveis ao fim de 200 h de ensaios.  

O material que ao longo de todos os estudos já descritos mostrou apresentar uma maior 

estabilidade mecânica, química e eletroquímica, o Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, foi usado na degradação 

de lixiviados de aterros sanitários, que são efluentes com cargas orgânicas e inorgânicas muito 

elevadas. Este material foi ainda usado em amostras de efluentes simulados contendo ácido 

húmico e sais inorgânicos. Embora os resultados obtidos para este material em termos de 

remoção de carga orgânica sejam, em geral, ligeiramente inferiores aos obtidos com outros 

materiais de ânodo, como o diamante dopado com boro (BDD) e o Ti/Pt/PbO2, os elétrodos de 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 provaram ser uma excelente alternativa àqueles dois materiais. Em 

particular, para a remoção de azoto total verifica-se que o ânodo Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 é mais 

eficiente do que o ânodo de BDD.

Abstract 

 
In this work, SnO2-SbOx films were prepared over different substrates and utilizing different 

electrodeposition techniques for the deposition of the tin and antimony layers over the 

substrates, namely alternate and simultaneous depositions. All the mixed oxides prepared were 

structural, morphological and electrochemically characterized by, respectively, X-ray 

diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry.   

To obtain thinner and uniform films, Sn-Sb oxide materials were prepared using the 

simultaneous and alternate deposition of the metals over several different substrates, namely 

Ti; Ti/Pt; Ti/Cu. All these materials were fully characterized and used in a thermodynamic 

study to find the material most suitable for oxygen evolution. It was observed that: Materials 

roughness depends mainly on the substrates roughness, being Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb the material with 

higher roughness; Oxides grown on Ti/Cu substrate presented the lowest potential for oxygen 

evolution, particularly the material prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition of Sn and Sb; 

The roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution potential.  

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb material, prepared by simultaneous Sn Sb electrodepositions, was utilized in a 

degradation study, using as model pollutant diclofenac. It was observed a good degradation 

rate of the diclofenac, with the electrode material presenting good mechanical, chemical and 

electrochemical stabilities.   

From all the prepared materials, the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 was the anode that presented more 

stability towards anodic oxidation, as well as the highest lifetime. For this reason, it was chosen 

to be used in the degradation of very complex real effluents, sanitary landfill leachates, and in 

the degradation of humic acid. Results were compared with other anode materials, boron-

doped diamond (BDD) and Ti/Pt/PbO2. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes proved to be an excellent 

alternative to the other materials, although they were not so efficient in the removal of the 

organic matter. On the other hand, they were more efficient than BDD in the removal of the 

total nitrogen.  

The exhaustive utilization of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, even with sanitary landfill leachates 

at 700 A m-2, has been showing that it is an excellent option to other electrode materials. 

However, the use of the platinization step increases its price and an alternative solution should 

be further attempted.

1. Introduction 

 

This chapter presents an overview on the motivation to develop the studies involving the 

preparation, the characterization and the environmental applications of stannous and antimony 

mixed oxides. It defines also the main objectives and the strategy implemented to attain the 

objectives.   

1.1 Environmental context  

Dyes, toxic organic molecules, inorganic salts, adsorbable organohalogens, aromatic pesticide 

residues, drugs, and surfactants are the major components of the wastewaters released from 

textile, leather, pulp and paper, printing, photograph, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food 

industries [Rao et al., 2014]. Wastewaters containing these chemicals are refractory and are 

often toxic to microorganisms involved in the biological treatment processes. Other major 

environmental concern are the leachates formed by the percolation of rainwater through the 

solid waste deposited on sanitary landfills [Fernandes et al., 2015]. 

In order to solve the environmental problems posed by the presence of all the cited toxic 

substances, several methods, besides the biological processes, have been endeavoured [Sirés 

et al., 2014]. Electrochemical degradation processes are being developed as an attempt to 

solve the environmental challenge posed by the effluents containing refractory substances, 

since they are attractive processes due to their environmental compatibility, simplicity, 

robustness in structure, and easy operation. Especially, electrolysis can be used as a 

pretreatment technology to detoxify ahead of biotreatment, rather than mineralizing 

completely the effluent to be treated, with high cost [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

Although organic wastes can, in general, be oxidized at numerous electrode materials, the 

electrochemical efficacy depends on the kind and on the structure of the anode materials 

[Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

Long service lifetime, large surface area, wide operating potential window between hydrogen 

and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials, high catalytic activity, physical stability, 

resistance to corrosion, low price, and easy to fabricate are the prerequisites to be fulfilled by 

the anodes employed in the electrochemical wastewater treatment [Rao et al., 2014]. 

The use of metallic oxide electrodes (MMO) for electrocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants 

is very promising. These electrodes generally consist of a titanium substrate covered with 

metallic oxide films, whose composition strongly affects their electrochemical behaviour. 

Among the metallic oxide electrodes, tin and antimony mixed oxide electrodes are one of the 

best candidates to be utilized as anodes for the electrochemical combustion of organic 

pollutants, since, in general, they present higher oxygen overpotential than other metallic 



2 

 

oxide electrodes, particularly when the appropriate preparation techniques are employed 

[Huang et al., 2007]. Nevertheless, there are very few studies in the literature where this 

material was utilized as anode for the degradation of complex mixtures [Cossu et al., 1998; 

Fernandes et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2016]. 

 

1.2 Global aims 

The main goal of this thesis was to search for an efficient tin and antimony metal oxides 

material to be utilized as anode, to find suitable and low-cost electrochemical solutions for the 

degradation of organic pollutants and refractory wastewaters, such as pharmaceutical 

compounds, and refractory wastewaters, such as sanitary landfill leachates and synthetic 

wastewaters containing humic acid.   

In this context, the objectives of this study are: 

1. To prepare Sb-doped SnO2 materials that are structural, chemical, mechanical and 

electrochemically stables. 

2. To obtain Sb-doped SnO2 materials with extended lifetime, suitable to be used in the 

degradation of organic pollutants or in the oxygen evolution reactions. 

3. To find correlations between the preparation method and the abilities of the prepared 

material for the different possible applications, namely degradation of organic 

pollutants or oxygen evolution reactions. 

4. To find, among all the prepared materials which is the most appropriate to be used as 

anode in the degradation of different types of pollutants. 

 

1.3 Strategy 

To attain the objectives defined in the previous point, the following strategy was implemented: 

1. To make Sb-doped SnO2 oxides using different preparation methods, namely alternate 

or simultaneously electrochemical depositions of tin and antimony layers, in order to 

obtain thin films with uniform surfaces, thus avoiding the interaction between the 

solution and the substrate or any existent interlayer. 

2. To test different substrates, besides titanium, to avoid the formation of the TiO2 

passivating film. A platinum interlayer was deposited over the titanium substrate and 

other substrates, such as copper, were also tested.  



3 

 

3. To perform the structural, morphological, chemical and electrochemically 

characterization of the oxides, for all the new materials prepared, to assess the 

influence of utilizing different deposition techniques or the deposition over different 

substrates. 

4. To perform a thermodynamic study, to evaluate some of the properties of the new 

materials and understand the influence of the metals deposition technique and of the 

substrate on that properties. 

5. To utilize the prepared materials that presented the most favourable properties for the 

degradation of different pollutants/wastewaters. 

 

1.4 Thesis overview 

This thesis is divided into five chapters. This first chapter presents the context in which this 

thesis is inserted and the overall goals to attain with the studies performed. It also gives a 

description of the strategy to achieve the proposed objectives. 

The second chapter contains a literature review on the preparation methods of tin and antimony 

mixed oxides and their environmental applications.  

Chapter 3 presents a description of the preparation methods employed to obtain the different 

tin and antimony oxide materials, utilizing different metal deposition strategies and different 

substrates. This chapter also contains the structural and morphological characterization of the 

prepared materials, as well as the assessment of the relative roughness of the prepared 

materials, utilizing electrochemical techniques. 

In Chapter 4, a thermodynamic study of the oxygen evolution reaction at the oxide anodes 

described in the previous chapter is presented. Chapter 4 also contains one environmental 

application of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb anode, in the degradation of diclofenac, and two environmental 

studies with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, using complex effluents, such as real leachate from 

sanitary landfills and simulated wastewaters, containing humic acid. At the end of both studies, 

the degradation efficiency of this material is compared with other reference anode materials, 

namely, Ti/Pt/PbO2, and commercial boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes.

2. SnO2-Sb2Ox films - Literature review 

 

SnO2 in its pure form is an n-type semiconductor, with a band gap of about 3.5 eV, which cannot 

be used directly as electrode material due to its high resistivity at room temperature. The 

conductivity, the electro-catalytic properties and the stability of the SnO2 films can be deeply 

increased by the introduction of dopant ions.  

Antimony is one of the most commonly used dopants in SnO2 films, because it can reduce the 

band gap and increase the conductivity and the electro-catalytic activity [Comninellis and 

Chen, 2010]. When doped with Sb, SnO2 electrodes present high overpotential for the oxygen 

evolution and electro-catalytic characteristics suitable for the oxidation of organic pollutants 

[Kong et al., 2007].  

In this chapter, a literature review on the different preparation methods of the stannous oxides, 

and the influence of the preparation method on the oxides properties will be first discussed. 

The influence of the SnO2 doping agent on the applications of the oxides will be also assessed. 

  

 

2.1 Films preparation methods 

 

The mixed metal oxide anodes are cheap and easy to fabricate [Rao et al., 2014]. Various 

preparation methods have been attempted to produce SnO2-Sb2Ox anodes. In general, these 

methods fall into two main groups: chemical methods, such as, thermochemical decomposition, 

electrodeposition, sol–gel method, spin coating, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), spray 

pyrolysis; and physical methods, like magnetron sputtering [Chen et al., 2010a; Zhang et al., 

2014]. However, when the objective is to prepare metal oxide anodes, the most common 

procedure is the layer by layer synthesis techniques, including thermochemical degradation of 

the support layer and electrodeposition of the active layer. This usually results in good anti-

corrosion characteristics of the inner layer and good electro-catalytic of the outer layer [Wu et 

al., 2014]. To ensure the stability of the oxides layer, it is necessary to ensure a good adhesion 

of this layer on the substrate. Thus, it is important to perform a pretreatment to remove grease 

or oxides from the surface of metal substrate, which might influence the layer adherence 

[Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

One of the most used substrates is titanium and many of the variations in the preparation of 

SnO2 electrodes are meant to extend the lifetime of the electrode, a problem associated with 

the performance of the Ti/SnO2 electrodes.  

The interaction of the electrode material with the substrate may also influence the chemical 

adsorption and the catalytic properties of the deposited metal oxides. Several studies have 

concluded that Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes have a short lifetime due to the formation of an 

intermediate layer of TiO2 with high resistivity [Berenguer et al., 2009]. This layer can be 

formed during the electrode preparation or during its use as anode because oxide films have a 



6 

 

considerable porosity. In both cases, the formation of a TiO2 interlayer is inevitable [Chen et 

al., 2005; Cossu et al., 1998 and Stucki et al., 1991a]. To avoid the formation of the TiO2 

interlayer, various attempts have been made, such as pre-platinization of the substrate, 

addition of an IrO2 layer and deposition of a Cu film over the substrate [Chen et al., 2005; 

Comninellis, 1992; Cossu et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2000; Rodgers et al., 1999]. 

In the following paragraphs, the main methods described in the literature for the preparation 

of metal oxide films will be discussed, giving a special emphasis to those utilized in the 

preparation of antimony-doped tin oxides. The influence of the preparation methods on the 

characteristics of the films will be considered. 

 

 

2.1.1 Thermochemical decomposition 

Thermochemical decomposition, or pyrolysis, is the most widely applied method for the 

fabrication of Sb-SnO2-based MMO anodes or Ir- and Ru-based MMO anodes. The main advantage 

of this synthesis method is its easy operation. In a typical thermochemical decomposition 

procedure, the metal salts, in general metal chlorides, are directly dissolved. The solvent used 

may be isopropanol, ethanol, butanol or their mixtures. In order to avoid the hydrolysis of the 

metal salts, it is necessary to acidify the precursor solution by adding hydrochloric acid. The 

calcination temperature is also a very important factor and it plays a critical role in the 

electrocatalytic performance of MMO anodes [Feng, 2010; Wu et al., 2014]. 

The MMO properties, such as, chemical composition, crystallinity and crystal grain size, surface 

morphology, electrical conductance, electrocatalysis performance, and electrode stability, are 

affected by the precursor composition, solvents and loadings, substrate pretreatment, and 

thermal decomposition parameters, especially the temperature and the duration of the 

preparation and calcinations processes [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

In general, the Sb-SnO2 films have a “cracked-mud” morphology, being formed by small uniform 

particles, and the electrode surface presents low roughness /porosity [Wu, 2014]. 

 

2.1.2 Electrodeposition  

 

Electrodeposition is a simple and cheap method for the preparation of metal oxides, even for 

large-scale production [Chen et al., 2010 b]. This method allows the direct deposition of the 

metal layer over the substrate, with a good control of the deposited amount and without 

needing adhesive substances to join the metal layer to the substrate [Bartlett, 2002; Chen et 

al., 2010 b; Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Musiani, 1997]. 

Electrodeposition is analogous to a galvanic cell acting in reverse. To deposit a metal, the 

substrate can be used as anode or cathode, and both electrodes must be immersed in an 

electrolytic solution containing one or more dissolved metal salts. When the substrate is used 

as anode, the application of a direct current to the anode can oxidize the metal atoms, forming 



7 

 

the metal oxide. If the substrate is utilized as cathode, the dissolved metal ions in the 

electrolyte solution are reduced and deposited over the cathode [Musiani, 1997]. 

Electrochemical deposition is rather used to prepare metals and conducting metal oxide films 

because it presents several interesting features: the thickness and morphology of the metal 

oxide layer can be controlled by varying the experimental parameters and the films are 

uniformly deposited at good deposition rates [Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Chen, 2010b]. This 

film layer uniformity is very important if the films are to be used in electrodegradation studies. 

Other advantages of the electrodeposition technique is that it can be performed at low 

temperature, with trivial equipment [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

The preparation of mixed metal oxides, like Sb-doped Sn oxides, can be prepared either by co-

electrodeposition together or by a sequencing electrodeposition [Comninellis and Chen, 2010]. 

In general, the films obtained by electrodeposition present granular surface structure and high 

electrocatalytic activity [Wu et al., 2014]. 

 

 

2.1.3 Other preparation methods 

? Sol-Gel method 

The sol-gel process is, in general, used to produce solid materials from small molecules. It can 

be utilized to prepare metal oxides by the conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution 

(sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of discrete particles or 

network polymers. Metal alkoxides can be used as typical precursors [Sakka, 2005; Wu et al., 

2014]. 

In general, the precursor salts are hydrolyzed, by dispersion, in appropriate media, followed 

by vigorous stirring. The formation of solid phase particles from hydrolyzed precursor is time 

dependent [Rao et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014]. 

The sol-gel process presents several advantages, such as: it allows deposition of thin films over 

substrates of different shapes or areas, and the films composition can be easily controlled by 

controlling the homogeneity and the concentration of the solutions, without using expensive 

equipment [Canevari, 2011; Sakka, 2005].  

The doped tin oxide films formed by sol-gel technique present heterogeneous cracked 

morphology. They have low impedance and very good electrocatalytic activity [Wu et al., 

2014]. 

 

? Spin Coating 

The spin coating technique is the most indicated for flat substrates because it leads to very 

uniform coatings. For uneven substrates, dip coating or painting is preferred. In the spin coating 

technique, a small amount of the coating material is deposited at the center of the substrate 

that is rotated at high speed to spread the coating material, due to the centrifugal force. The 

material is then dried and the process of coating and drying is repeated until a desired thickness 

of the coat is obtained. Finally, the coated substrate is annealed to obtain the desired thickness 



8 

 

that will give the material the wanted morphological characteristics and wear resistance [Rao 

et al., 2014]. 

 

? Chemical Vapor Deposition 

In Chemical Vapor Deposition, generally the reactant (precursors) gases are pumped into the 

reaction chamber, maintained at optimum temperature and pressure, where these reactive 

gases are adsorbed and react with the substrate to form a thin film. Metal organic chemical 

vapor deposition utilizes organometallic compounds as precursors. Using this technique, thin 

films with high uniformity can be reproduced. However, it involves complex processes, high 

temperature, and toxic gases. Amjoud et al. (1998), Duverneuil et al. (2002), Yusta et al. (1997) 

and Watts et al. (2008) have used gas phase methods for the preparation of thin film metal 

oxide-coated electrodes. 

CVD appears to be the least attempted chemical method for preparing MMO anodes, due to its 

high operation cost and the difficulty in introducing several metal precursors in the furnace 

[Rao et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014]. 

The films prepared by this technique present dense, homogeneous surface with high roughness 

[Wu et al., 2014]. 

Recently, Ti/SnO2 anodes were prepared by chemical vapor deposition without O2 as a 

precursor, H20 as a precursor was used, avoiding the formation of the TiO2 passivation layer. 

These electrodes presented a compact microstructure with high overpotential for oxygen 

evolution and a superior activity for pollutant oxidation. Although a higher surface area should 

lead to improved catalytic properties in this electrode (as in BDD) prepared by CVD, the surface 

area was smaller than when prepared by conventional methods, but the catalytic properties 

were still improved.  

 

? Spray Pyrolysis 

Spray pyrolysis is an aerosol process, relatively simple and cost effective. It involves the 

atomization of the precursors in the form of droplets and the conversion of these droplets into 

solid particles by heating. The nature of the deposit obtained on the substrate is dependent on 

the transformations suffered by the droplets. There are several parameters influencing the 

transformations experienced by the droplets, namely, the temperature gradient between the 

spraying nozzle and the substrate, the carrier gas and precursor solution flow velocity, and 

shape and nature of the substrate [Rao et al., 2014]. 

 

? Magnetron Sputtering 

In the basic sputtering process, a target (or cathode) plate is bombarded by energetic ions 

generated in a glow discharge plasma, located in front of the target. The bombardment process 

causes the removal, i.e., “sputtering”, of target atoms, which may then condense on a 

substrate as a thin film.  



9 

 

Secondary electrons are also emitted from the target surface as a result of the ion 

bombardment, and these electrons play an important role in maintaining the plasma. The basic 

sputtering process has been known for many years and many materials have been successfully 

deposited using this technique [Kelly and Arnell, 2000]. 

The sputtering method presents several advantages, namely high adhesion of films, facility of 

sputtering any metal, alloy or compound, high-purity films, ability to coat heat-sensitive 

substrates, and excellent uniformity on large-area substrates, which explains the numerous 

applications of the sputtered films [Barrocas et al., 2013]. 

 

2.2 Applications of SnO2-Sb2Ox films 

 

There are a multitude of examples in the literature about possible applications of antimony-

doped tin oxides [Lan et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2015]. However, as this study was mainly 

focused on environmental applications and water oxidation using SbSn mixed oxides, a 

literature review on these subjects will be presented below.  

 

   

2.2.1 Environmental applications 

 

Pollution by recalcitrant organic compounds is a significant environmental problem mainly 

because the most spread wastewater treatments are based on biological processes that fail in 

their degradation. To prevent the release of these compounds to the environment new 

treatment techniques to complement or even substitute the biological processes must be 

developed. In particular, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), processes where there is 

production of OH radicals, are being under intensive study, since they can operate in an 

efficient and sustainable way [Chaplin, 2014; Sirés et al., 2014]. 

Among AOPs, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have emerged as a 

promising technologies for the destruction of recalcitrant compounds and complex wastewaters 

[Chaplin, 2014; Sirés et al., 2014]. 

The electrochemical treatment effectiveness depends on many factors, namely, on the 

electrode material, because its nature is determinant for the type of mechanism involved in 

the pollutants degradation process and strongly influences its selectivity and efficiency 

[Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Panizza and Cerisola, 2005]. 

There are several electrochemical techniques for the pollutants removal or degradation, such 

as electrocoagulation/flocculation, electro-Fenton, cathodic reduction, and anodic oxidation. 

Since the anodic oxidation was the technique utilized in this thesis for the degradation of 

several types of polluted wastewaters, the following paragraphs will be mainly focused on the 

application of this process using MMOs. 



10 

 

The ideal electrode material for the electro-oxidation of organic pollutants should be stable as 

anode in the electrolytic medium and present high activity for the oxidation of the organic 

matter and low activity towards secondary reactions. It should also be cheap and environmental 

compactible [Chen et al., 2010b; Comninellis and Chen, 2010; Maharana et al., 2015]. 

Comninellis (1994) has investigated different anode materials, namely Pt, Ti/IrO2, and Ti/SnO2, 

in the electrochemical conversion/combustion of several organic pollutants. Simplified 

mechanisms for electrochemical oxidation and combustion were presented, being the first step 

of the mechanism the discharge of water molecules to form •OH radicals: 

 

MOx + H2O ? MOx(•OH) + H
+ + e-                 (1) 

 

Depending on the nature of the electrode material (MOx), selective oxidation (for ‘‘active’’ 

electrodes) or combustion (for ‘‘non-active’’ electrode) can occur. The Ti/SnO2 has been 

considered “non-active” electrode since Sn(IV) is the highest oxidation state. This anode has 

high overvoltage for oxygen evolution reaction and can promote the oxidation of organic 

compounds by highly reactive OH radicals, generated at the electrode surface [Comninellis, 

1994]. 

The performance of doped SnO2 electrodes is believed to be superior to Pt, graphite, PbO2, and 

many other common electrodes, due to its higher current efficiency and because the oxidation 

reactions on the SnO2 electrode are very unselective, which gave to this electrode the 

possibility of being applied to a multitude of different wastewaters [Chen et al., 2005; 

Comninellis and Pulgarin, 1993; Stucki et al., 1991a; Stucki et al., 1991b].  

The anodic oxidation of phenol was performed on different electrode materials and a SnO2–

Sb2O5 electrode showed the highest ability to completely oxidize phenol among PbO2, IrO2, 

RuO2, and Pt, and with a current efficiency over three times higher than for the other electrodes 

[Rodgers et al., 1999]. In addition, the behavior of a Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5 electrode in the 

electrodegradation of phenol in the presence of NaCl was studied and compared with that of a 

Ti/IrO2 electrode, but the indirect oxidation process attributed to ClO
- was only verified with 

the Ti/IrO2 electrode [Comninellis and Nerini, 1995]. 

Ti/SnO2 and Ti/IrO2 anodes were also used in the oxidation of 1,4-benzoquinone [Pulgarin et 

al., 1994]. With Ti/IrO2, non-toxic carboxylic acids were obtained as final products, while these 

carboxylic acids were oxidized to CO2 with Ti/SnO2. 

Polcaro et al. in 1999 compared the performance of Sb-doped Ti/SnO2 and Ti/PbO2 anodes in 

the electrochemical degradation of 2-chlorophenol and concluded that Ti/SnO2 presented a 

better ability to oxidize toxic compounds. These two electrode materials were also used in the 

electrochemical treatment of landfill leachate, but did not show substantial differences under 

the experimental conditions used, achieving a COD removal of 50% from a leachate with an 

initial COD of 1200 mg/L [Cossu et al., 1998]. A Ti–SnO2–Sb2O5 electrode, prepared by the 

thermal method, and a BDD electrode were used in the anodic oxidation of acetic acid, maleic 

acid, and phenol [Chen et al., 2003]. Interestingly, the BDD electrode presented a higher 



11 

 

current efficiency and service-life. Furthermore, a mixed oxide electrode of Ti/SnO2–Sb2O3–

Nb2O5/PbO2 was applied to the oxidation of phenol with good performance [Yang et al., 2009]. 

The SnO2–Sb2O3 layer was obtained by dipping and annealing at 450 ºC under an influx of oxygen, 

followed by Nb2O5/PbO2 electrodeposition. Recently, the anodic oxidation of 4-chloro-3-

methylphenol in aqueous solution using Ti/SnO2–Sb/PbO2 electrodes was investigated [Song et 

al., 2010]. PbO2 was used because it is a cheap material, easy to prepare and has low resistivity, 

good chemical stability and, with a SnO2 + Sb2O3 interlayer, increased lifetime and 

electrocatalytic activity.  

In another recent report in this area, Sb-doped SnO2 electrodes were prepared by two different 

methods, electrodeposition followed by thermal oxidation, which gave a nanocoated material, 

and by a dip-coating method, where a non-nanocoated material was obtained [Liu and Feng, 

2009]. When comparing the performance of both these electrodes, the nanocoated electrode 

gave a faster and higher phenol and TOC removals, probably due to the larger specific surface 

area and oxygen adsorption.  

The various studies found in the literature have shown that doped Ti/SnO2 is a very promising 

material for the electrodegradation of organics, due to its unselective character toward anodic 

oxidation and also because of its low price, especially when compared to BDD.  

 

2.2.2 Oxygen Evolution 

 

The anodic activity of an electrode material depends on the overpotential for oxygen evolution 

reaction. If the material is to be used in the production of oxygen from the water 

electrooxidation reaction, there are advantages in choosing materials with a low overpotential 

for oxygen evolution so that the energy consumption becomes lower. Additionally, at these 

materials, the direct anodic oxidation of pollutants occurs with high efficiency for low current 

densities [Armenta-Armenta and Diaz, 2005] because if the current density is high, a significant 

decrease in the current efficiency is expected due to oxygen evolution. However, it was 

observed that the electrochemical combustion of most of the organic compounds only occurs 

without the loss of electrode activity at anode materials presenting high overpotential for 

oxygen evolution [Comninellis, 1994]. According to a compilation of values for oxygen evolution 

overpotentials at different anode materials presented by Chen [2004] in a review paper, SnO2 

and PbO2 anodes have similar oxygen evolution overpotentials, which are higher than that of 

platinum and lower than that of BDD. Thus, regarding current efficiency, SnO2 or PbO2 anodes 

are more advantageous than BDD. The anodic oxidation of pollutants is more efficient in the 

oxygen evolution region because, in addition to avoiding polarization of the electrode’s surface, 

hydroxyl radicals can be produced and promote pollutant oxidation by indirect processes, 

although with a decrease in the current efficiency due to the competition between 

water/pollutant oxidation. 

Although anodic oxidation is an effective technique for producing oxygen or oxidizing organic 

pollutants, to achieve good oxidation rates, the choice of the appropriate anode material is of 



12 

 

great importance, and it must possess suitable oxygen overpotential, good electrical 

conductivity and electrochemical and mechanical stabilities [Martínez-Huitle et al., 2004; 

Martínez-Huitle and Andrade, 2011; Sirés and Brillas, 2012; Wu et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2011]. 

Various electrode materials, such as platinum, carbon, BDD and metal oxides, namely PbO2, 

SnO2, RuO2 and IrO2, have already been studied [Ciríaco et al., 2009; Panizza and Cerisola, 

2004; Sirés and Brillas, 2012]. Among them, SnO2 has been extensively tested due to its low 

preparation cost.  

Although the increasing concern over environmental pollution brought renewed attention to 

research for suitable anode materials, the interest in the kinetics and mechanism of the oxygen 

evolution reaction in the process of the water electrolysis still remains of great importance 

[Villullas et al., 2003]. The study of the electrocatalytic properties of electrodes coated with 

films of metal oxides is of fundamental importance for the understanding of their 

electrochemical behavior, including the Tafel slope, exchange current density, the effect of 

the temperature on the kinetic parameters and the apparent activation energy [Lassali et al., 

1999; Suffredini et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2011].

3. Preparation and characterization of tin and 

antimony mixed oxides 

 

This chapter presents the preparation method and the results from the characterization of the 

Sb-doped SnO2 films, prepared by different techniques and utilizing different substrates: 

? Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, prepared by alternate electrodeposition over a platinized titanium foil; 

? Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3, prepared by alternate electrodeposition over a titanium foil previously 

recovered with a copper layer; 

? Ti/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a titanium foil; 

? Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a platinized titanium foil; 

? Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb, prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition over a titanium foil previously 

recovered with a copper layer. 

The studies presented in this chapter were already published in specialized journals [Santos et 

al., 2013; Santos et al., 2014a]. 

   

 

3.1 Materials and methods  

 

3.1.1 Reagents  

In the preparation of the electrodes, the following reagents were used: titanium foil, 0.25 mm 

thick, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich; sodium hydroxide, 96.8%, Pronalab; oxalic acid, 99%, Merck; 

chloridric acid, 37%, Pronalab; H2PtCl6.xH2O, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich; tin (II) chloride, 98%, Sigma-

Aldrich; antimony (III) chloride, 99%, Fluka; citric acid, 100%, Pronalab; copper sulfate, 99%, 

Merck; tartaric Acid, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich; Na4P2O7.10H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich; Gelatine, Merck 

and Sulfuric Acid, 95 to 98%, Sigma-Aldrich. 

 

3.1.2 Characterization techniques 

The electrodes were structurally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) at room 

temperature using a Rigaku DMAXIII/C diffractometer with Cu K? radiation (?= 0.15406 nm) at 

30 kV/40 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected in the range of 2? = 10–90º with a 0.028 

step and an acquisition time of 2 s per step.  

The morphologies were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microanalysis was 

performed by dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS), in a Hitachi (S-2700)/Oxford (60–74) 

system, operating at 20 keV.  

The electrochemical behavior was evaluated by voltammetric studies. The cyclic voltammetric 

measurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat VoltaLab PGZ 301, in a one-

compartment cell, with a 10 cm2 doped-Sb SnO2 electrode as the working electrode, a 5 cm
2 



14 

 

(per side) platinum plate as the counter electrode and a commercial saturated Ag/AgCl,KClsat 

electrode as the reference electrode. 

The relative roughness factor, Rf, of the electrodes’ coating was estimated by running cyclic 

voltammetric curves with the prepared metal oxides as the working electrode. Because the 

electrodes are made of conductive oxides, the double-layer charging current, I, which is closely 

related to the double-layer capacitance, C, of the electrode/solution interface, is linearly 

dependent on the scanning rate, ?. Thus, running cyclic voltammetries at different scan rates 

in the potential region where only double-layer charging currents are observed, different I 

values can be obtained for the different scan rates, at a constant E value that is the point at 

which an approximate symmetry for the anodic and cathodic currents is observed. From the 

plot of I versus ? a linear correlation can be obtained. The slope of the obtained equation 

divided by the geometric area of the electrode yields the normalized capacitance of the 

oxide/solution interface (C = dq/dE = dI/d?). To estimate the relative roughness factor of the 

films, the normalized capacitance is compared with that of an oxide with a smooth surface, 

which is assumed to be 60 µF cm-2. 

 

 

3.2 Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 

 

3.2.1 Electrode preparation 

Ti substrates, with dimensions of 2 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.25 mm, were pre-treated by mechanical 

polishing followed by etching with 40 % NaOH (w/w) at 80 ºC for 2 h and 15 % oxalic acid (w/w) 

at 98 ºC for 1 h. The substrates were then washed with double-distilled water. Substrate 

platinization was performed in a one-compartment double-walled cell connected to a 

thermostatic water bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 65 ºC. The cell contained 

a chloroplatinic acid solution, and a current density of 250 mA cm-2 was applied using the Ti 

substrate as the cathode and two platinum plates (8 cm2) as anodes.  

After platinization, alternate Sn and Sb electrodepositions on the Ti substrate were carried out 

in the same cell. For the Sn deposition, 100 mL of an aqueous solution with 0.948 g of SnCl2 and 

2 mL of concentrated chloridric acid was used with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 maintained 

for 30 min at 35 ºC. For the Sb deposition, 100 mL of an aqueous solution with 1.329 g of SbCl3 

and 3.842 g of citric acid was used with a current density of 10 mA cm-2 maintained for 10 min 

at 35 ºC. These two procedures were repeated 4 times. 

After this treatment, the electrodes were heated in a tubular furnace at 550 ºC for 6 h, to 

obtain the respective oxides. The geometric area of the prepared electrodes was 10 cm2 (both 

sides).

? Structural Characterization by DRX 

 

After calcination at 550 ºC, an X-ray diffractogram of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was 

obtained (Figure 1) and compared with those from the JCPDS ICDS database. The presence of 

the Sb2O4 (file PDF#11-0694, relative to an orthorhombic structure with a = 5.436 Å, b = 4.81 Å 

and c = 11.76 Å) and SnO2 (file PDF # 41-1445, tetragonal structure with a = b = 4.7382 Å and c 

= 3.1871 Å) phases were confirmed. A platinum phase was also identified (PDF # 04-0802), 

probably detected due to the porosity and thickness of the material.

? Morphological characterization by SEM 
 

Morphology views of the Ti substrate (Figure 2 a), platinized (Figure 2 b) and covered with the 

oxides Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode (Figure 3), are presented. The appearance of the Ti substrate 

platinized is similar to cauliflower. The morphology of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode is quite 

different from that of the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes prepared in a similar way but without 

platinization, which presented the characteristics of cracked mud [Andrade et al., 2004; Ciríaco 

et al., 2011; Zanta et al., 2003]. In fact, the morphology views of Figure 3 show a granular 

morphology.

? Chemical Characterization by EDS 
 

The results from the EDS analysis of the final stage of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrodes, in 

atomic molar percentages, were as follows: O - 74%, Sn - 9% and Sb - 17%. The Sb content was 

higher than expected, possibly because the final electrodeposited layer consists of antimony, 

which is more easily detected by EDS. 

 

? Relative roughness 

 

Figure 4 presents several cyclic voltammograms recorded at different scan rates between 2 and 

50 mV s-1 in 0.035 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution from 0.6 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl,KClsat. The I values 

for the different scan rates were obtained at E = 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl,KClsat, the point at which 

an approximate symmetry for the anodic and cathodic currents was observed. From the plot of 

I versus ? for the Ti/Pt/SnO2–Sb2O4 electrode (Figure 4 and inset), the following linear equation 

was obtained: 

 

I (A) = 0.0245 ? (V s?1) + 0.000068, with r2 = 0.997     (2) 



17 

 

Dividing the slope value by the geometric area of the electrode yields the normalized 

capacitance of the oxide/solution interface, CTi/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4=0.00245 F cm
-2. 

To estimate the relative roughness factor of the Ti/Pt/SnO2–Sb2O4 film, its capacitance was 

divided by 60 µF cm-2, providing an Rf of 41 for the prepared material.  

In a previous work with these electrodes [Ciríaco et al., 2011], which were not platinized and 

with 4 alternate depositions of each metal, a normalized capacitance of 0.0466 F cm?2 and a 

roughness factor of 777 were obtained; however, the deposition time for each metal was 4 

times longer. The roughness factors were lower for the platinized electrode prepared in this 

work, likely due to the lower metal deposition time used in this case, which prevents the 

growth of surface imperfections and decreases the roughness factor of the films. The metal 

deposition time was reduced to avoid excessive imperfections, which fall into the solution 

and increase electrode preparation costs. 

Wu and co-workers in 2008 have prepared amorphous tin oxide (SnOx) films by cathodic 

deposition on graphite, achieving a specific capacitance of 0.255 F cm?2 and a roughness 

factor of 4167, which is much higher than that obtained in this work. This order-of-magnitude 

discrepancy between roughness factors is not unusual; the literature includes roughness 

factors for metal oxide films that vary by factors of several thousand.

3.3 Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3  

 

3.3.1 Electrode preparation 

In the first step of the Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3 electrode preparation, the Ti substrate was pre-

treated as previously described in preparation of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4. The copper deposition on 

the Ti substrate, pretreated, was performed in a one-compartment double-wall cell connected 

to a thermostatic water-bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 44ºC. The cell 

contained a copper sulfate aqueous solution and a current density of 50 mA cm-2 was applied 



18 

 

for 0.5 h using Ti substrate as the cathode and two platinum plates as anodes [Martínez-Huitle 

and Andrade, 2011]. After copper deposition, alternate Sn and Sb electrodepositions on the Ti 

substrate were carried out in the same cell and in the same method of section 3.2.1.  

After this treatment, the electrodes were heated in a tubular furnace at 550 ºC, as for the 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4

After calcination at 550 ºC, an X-ray diffractogram of the Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3 electrode was 

obtained (Figure 5) and compared with those from the JCPDS ICDS database. The presence of 

the SnO2 (file PDF#41-1445) and Sb2O3 (file PDF#43-1071) phases were confirmed. A SbSn 

intermetallic phase (PDF#33-0118) can also be detected.

To determine the oxides’ capacitance, cyclic voltammetric curves were run at scanning rates 

varying from 2 to 50 mV s?1, in 0.035 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, in a one-compartment 

electrochemical cell, using the prepared oxide as working electrode. Figure 8 presents the 

cyclic voltammograms recorded in the potential range where only double-layer charging 

currents were observed. From the plot of I values vs scan rates (inset of Figure 8), at E=-0.18 V, 

a Rf of 70 was obtained for the Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3 material.

3.4 Ti/SnO2-Sb 

 

3.4.1 Electrode preparation 

 

To achieve more uniform films than those prepared by alternate deposition of tin and antimony, 

a different deposition method was tested, where tin and antimony were electrodeposited 

simultaneously [Martínez-Huitle and Andrade, 2011]. 

The Ti substrate was first pretreated, and the pretreatment consisted of a mechanical polishing 

of the substrate followed by its immersion in a concentrated chloridric acid boiling bath for 1 

minute. For the Ti/SnO2-Sb anode preparation, simultaneous deposition of tin and antimony on 

the Ti substrate was performed using a one-compartment double-wall cell connected to a 

thermostatic water-bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 44ºC. The cell contained 

a tin and antimony solution and a current density of 2.5 mA cm-2 was applied for 1 h using Ti 

substrate as the cathode between two Pt plate anodes. The molar ratios of the components of 

the electrodeposition solutions were 16:1:54.8:5.9 of SnCl2:SbCl3:Na4P2O7.10H2O:C4H6O6, with 

the SnCl2 concentration of 0.13 mol L
?1. A 0.4 g L?1 solution of gelatine was also added. After 

this treatment, the electrodes were heated in a tubular furnace at 500 ºC for 2 h to obtain the 

respective oxides.

phase (PDF#33-0118) can also be detected in the diffractogram. In this films prepared by the 

simultaneous electrodeposition method, some diffraction lines, not assigned to the previous 

discussed phases, can be assigned to the Sn,Sb-P2O7 phases [Chernaya et al., 2005; Xu et al., 

2012 Hibino and Kobayashi, 2013] because pyrophosphate is used in the simultaneous 

electrodeposition preparation method.

3.5 Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb 

 

3.5.1 Electrode preparation 

 

The Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb electrode preparation comprised the substrate pretreatment, the 

electrodeposition of the platinum intermediate layer, the simultaneously deposition of tin and 

antimony and finally the heating of the electrode in a tubular furnace at 500 ºC for 2 h to obtain 

the respective oxides. 

The pretreatment consisted of a mechanical polishing of the titanium substrate followed by its 

immersion in a concentrated chloridric acid boiling bath for 1 minute. The Pt deposition on the 

Ti pretreated substrate was performed as described elsewhere [Andrade et al., 2007]. 

For the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb anode, simultaneous deposition of tin and antimony on the Ti substrate 

was performed using a one-compartment double-wall cell connected to a thermostatic water-

bath, which enabled the recirculation of water at 44ºC. The solutions’ composition is described 

in section 3.4.1.

In this films prepared by the simultaneous electrodeposition method, some diffraction lines, 

not assigned to the previous discussed phases when the alternate deposition were performed, 

can be assigned to the Sn,Sb-P2O7 phases [Chernaya et al., 2005; Hibino and Kobayashi, 2013;

preparation method.

heating of the electrode in a tubular furnace at 500 ºC for 2 h to obtain the respective oxides. 

The pretreatement was similar to that already described (3.4.1). The copper deposition on the 

Ti substrate, pretreated, was performed as in section 3.3.1  

For the Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb anode, simultaneous deposition of tin and antimony on the Ti substrate 

was performed as previously described (3.4.1).

3.7 Discussion and conclusions   

Looking at the structural characterization, when Sn and Sb electrodepositions were carried out 

simultaneously the predominant phase was the SnO2, assigned according to the file PDF#41-

1445 from the JCPDS ICDS database. In the materials prepared with a Pt or Cu electrodeposited 

interlayer, Pt or Cu diffraction lines were, respectively, identified. When the Sn and Sb 

electrodepositions were alternated, the formation of distinct Sn or Sb oxide phases was 

observed: SnO2 (PDF#41-1445) and Sb2O4 (PDF#11-0694) or Sb2O3 (PDF#43-1071). This fact is in 

agreement with what was previously observed in the cases of Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 [Ciríaco et al., 

2011], with a different electrodeposition time from the one prepared in this work, and 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 [Santos et al., 2013], although antimony presents a different oxidation state 

when copper is the interlayer, possibly due to competition between copper and antimony for 

the oxygen. An SbSn intermetallic phase (PDF#33-0118) can be detected in almost all of the 

diffractograms. The simultaneous or alternated electrodeposition form of Sn and Sb produce 

different results: when Sn and Sb electrodeposition is simultaneous, Sb may substitute Sn in the 

lattice, and only one oxide phase, SnO2, is obtained in addition to the intermetallic SbSn phase; 

when the Sn and Sb electrodeposition is alternated, the two oxide phases are obtained. In the 

films prepared by the simultaneous electrodeposition method, some diffraction lines, not 

assigned to the previous discussed phases, can be assigned to the Sn,Sb-P2O7 phases [Chernaya 

et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2012; Hibino and Kobayashi, 2013] because pyrophosphate is used in the 

simultaneous electrodeposition preparation method.  

Regarding the SEM results, it can be observed that the introduction of a Pt or Cu interlayer 

increases the roughness of the surface, particularly in the case of the Pt layer. Ti/SnO2-Sb and 

Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb present similar morphologies, with homogeneous Sn-Sb oxide crystallites with a 

globular form consisting of 5-10 µm agglomerates of smaller crystallites. The structure is highly 

porous. The introduction of a Pt metallic interlayer reduces the porosity of the film and 



27 

 

presents a more compact coating similar to cauliflower. However, the number of agglomerates 

is higher and presents lower dimensions, leading to a higher surface area.  

In Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4, prepared with a shorter deposition time than the one presented in Ciríaco et 

al. (2011), shows a different morphology from the cracked mud view that characterizes these 

films [Andrade et al., 2004; Montilla et al., 2004]. This fact is related to the higher homogeneity 

obtained in the films prepared with shorter deposition times that prevents a higher separation 

of the two phases, with different thermal expansion coefficients. In Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3, two 

distinct morphologies are presented, evidencing the two oxide phases identified by X-ray 

diffraction: one with a sea sponge look, attributed to tin oxide, and another with a branched 

tree form, attributed to antimony oxide. 

Considering the relative roughness the highest roughness factor was found for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. 

Comparing Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb (Rf =201) prepared with simultaneous metal electrodeposition, with 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf =41), prepared in a previous work by alternating metal electrodeposition 

[Santos et al., 2013], it may be concluded that, for this platinized material, simultaneous 

electrodeposition produces higher roughness factors, as shown by the SEM results (Figure 13 a 

and b, and [Santos et al., 2013]). The explanation for this fact is that the roughness of the 

platinized titanium is very high (see Figure 2 b) and can influence the roughness of the posterior 

SnO2-Sb layer, whose thickness is low, because it is prepared with only one simultaneous Sn,Sb 

electrodeposition. On the other hand, the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode is prepared with 4 

alternating electrodepositions of each metal, leading to a higher thickness that can minimize 

roughness. Comparing the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf =18), prepared in this work, with Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 (Rf 

=777), prepared in a previous work [Ciríaco et al., 2011], both by alternating metal 

electrodeposition but different electrodeposition durations, it can be concluded that a fourfold 

increasing in the electrodeposition time increases the roughness. The main differences found 

in the roughness factors for the Sn-Sb oxide films prepared on Ti/Pt or Ti/Cu must be due to 

the interlayers of Pt or Cu that present completely different aspects (see Figure 2 b and 6). 

From the observed roughness factors obtained for the films prepared in this work, it seems that 

they depend on the substrate morphology, as well as on the electrodeposition process and 

probably also on the film thickness. It is difficult to show a linear behavior for the roughness 

from the experimental details.

4. Environmental applications of tin and antimony 

mixed oxides  

 

This chapter presents different environmental applications of tin and antimony mixed oxides. 

It starts with a description of the materials and methods utilized in the studies performed with 

the different electrode materials.  

The results of the thermodynamic study of the oxygen evolution reaction for all the tin and 

antimony mixed oxides, whose preparation and characterization was described in the previous 

chapter, are then presented and discussed.  

The utilization of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb as anode in the degradation of a pharmaceutical compound, 

diclofenac, is also presented in this chapter. 

Due to its mechanical, chemical and electrochemical stabilities and extended lifetime, 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 was chosen as anode for the electrodegradation of complex mixtures, namely: 

? biologically pretreated sanitary landfill leachate and simulated samples, having in their 

composition only different N-containing compounds, without organic matter; 

? raw sanitary landfill leachate and synthetic samples, containing humic acid and 

inorganic salts, with COD and ammonium ion contents similar to that of the real 

leachate. 

The results and the main conclusions obtained in these two studies are also presented in this 

chapter. 

 

4.1 Materials and Methods 

 

4.1.1 Reagents 

The following reagents were used as purchased in the preparation of synthetic samples: 

Ammonium nitrate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, humic acid, 

ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride and potassium chloride.  

The chemicals used as model pollutants and electrolyte were sodium diclofenac salt (DIC) and 

sodium sulfate, respectively. 

The reagents were analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without 

additional purification.

4.1.2 Samples characterization techniques 

 

Several parameters were used to characterize samples and to follow the electrochemical 

experiments, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand BOD5, 

dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total kjedahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia 

nitrogen (AN), pH, conductivity (Cond.), suspended solids (SS), dissolved solids (DS) and UV–

visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrophotometry. Also, chloride, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium 

concentrations were determined by ion chromatography. In subsections below, a brief 

description of the analytical methods and equipment’s used to determine each parameter is 

presented. 

4.1.2.1 Chemical oxygen demand 

The COD is commonly used to indirectly measure the amount of organic matter in samples and 

to evaluate the performance of the oxidation treatment in these samples. It is defined as the 

amount of a specified oxidant that reacts with the sample under controlled conditions. The 

quantity of oxidant consumed is expressed in terms of its oxygen equivalence. The basis for the 

COD determination methods is that nearly all carbon content of the organic compounds can be 

fully oxidized to carbon dioxide with a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. 

In this work, COD was determined by closed reflux titrimetric method, following the procedure 

described in Section 5220C of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005]. Dichromate ion is the 

oxidant used in this method, being reduced to the chromic ion. In COD determinations, 

digestion of the samples occurred in strongly acid solution with a known quantity of potassium 

dichromate that has to be in excess, and containing also a silver catalyst to oxidize resistant 

organic compounds and mercury sulphate to reduce interferences from the oxidation of chloride 

ions. The samples closed reflux digestion was performed, using a thermoreactor Merck 

Spectroquant TR 420, during 2 h at 150 ºC. After digestion, the remaining unreduced K 2Cr2O7 

was titrated with ferrous ammonium sulphate, using ferroine as indicator, to determine the 

amount of K2Cr2O7 consumed. The titration was performed using an automatic titrator Metrohm 

876 Dosimat Plus. The dichromate consumed by the sample is equivalent to the amount of 

oxygen required to oxidize the organic matter. 

4.1.2.2 Biochemical oxygen demand 

The BOD is defined as the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic 

matter dissolved in samples. Its function is similar to that of COD, since both measure the 

amount of organic compounds present in waters and wastewaters. However, COD is less 

specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, and the BOD evaluate 

biologically active organic matter. Biochemical oxygen demand determination occurs over some 

variable period of time depending on temperature, nutrient concentrations, and the enzymes 



31 

 

available to indigenous microbial populations. This is not a precise quantitative test, although 

it is widely used as an index of the biodegradable organic matter present in a wastewater, 

being an important parameter to evaluate the quality of wastewaters’ treatment results. 

BOD determination is a slow process that theoretically requires an infinite time to be 

completed. To overcome this drawback, it is determined the BOD5, which corresponds to an 

incubation period of 5 days at which about 60-70% of the reaction has occurred. It is also used 

the BOD20, that corresponds to an incubation period of 20 days in which 95-99% of organic 

matter has already been degraded. 

In this work, BOD5 was determined by the respirometric method, following the procedure 

described in Section 5210D of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005], which provided the 

direct measurement of the oxygen consumed by microorganisms from an air enriched 

environment, in a closed vessel, under conditions of constant temperature (20±1 ºC) and 

stirring. Manometric respirometers were used, which relate oxygen uptake to the change in 

pressure caused by oxygen consumption while maintaining a constant volume. The assays were 

performed in a WTW Oxitop IS 12 with Inductive Stirring System, in a WTW TS 606-G/2-i 

Thermostat Cabinet, using lyophilized biomass PolySeed, commercially available. 

4.1.2.3 Dissolved organic carbon 

The total organic carbon is the amount of organic carbon in the samples, expressed in 

concentration of carbon. Unlike COD or BOD5, TOC is independent of the oxidation state of the 

organic matter. It is a global parameter that allows the evaluation of the mineralization 

efficiency of the leachate sample treatment. In the present work, it was measured DOC, which 

is the fraction of TOC that passes through a 0.45 µm pore-diameter filter. 

DOC was determined by the high-temperature combustion method, following the procedure 

described in Section 5310B of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005]. Its value is not 

achieved by direct measurement, the method used in this work analyses separately the 

dissolved fractions of total carbon (DC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and DOC is then determined 

by subtracting DIC from DC. 

The DOC determinations were performed in a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyser, which combines 

combustion catalytic oxidation at 680°C and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detection method. 

The samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter, from Whatman (GF/F filter, 0.45 µm). 

For the DC determinations, an automated process injected the sample into the combustion 

furnace, where it undergoes combustion through heating at 680 ºC, with a platinum catalyst in 

an oxygen rich atmosphere. The water is vaporized and the organic and inorganic carbons are 

oxidized to CO2 and H2O. The gas phase, containing the CO2, is transported by the carrier gas 

through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers, to remove water vapour and halides from the gas 



32 

 

stream before it reaches the detector. The CO2 concentration is then measured with non-

dispersive infrared detector. DIC is measured separately by injecting the sample into a reaction 

chamber where it is acidified, and all inorganic carbon is converted to CO2, which is carried to 

the detector and measured. The obtained DIC or DC values are the average of, at least, two 

measurements. Regularly, calibration curves are performed.  

4.1.2.4 Total nitrogen 

The total nitrogen determination accounts for all forms of organic and inorganic nitrogen 

present in the leachate sample. Since before TN determinations samples are filtered through a 

GF/F Whatman filter, 0.45 µm, it is assumed that, in complex matrix samples as sanitary landfill 

leachates, TN stands for total dissolved nitrogen. 

TN was measured in a Shimadzu TNM-1 unit coupled with the TOC-VCPH analyser. All nitrogen 

present in samples is first converted to nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide by catalytic 

combustion in the furnace. Then, the nitrogen species react with ozone, to form an excited 

state of nitrogen dioxide. Upon returning to ground state, the emitted light energy is measured, 

using a chemiluminescence detector, and converted to TN. 

4.1.2.5 Total Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen 

TKN measures the sum of organic nitrogen, ammonia and ammonium. It is determined using the 

Kjeldahl method that determines all the nitrogen in the trinegative state present in the 

samples. This method fails to account for nitrogen in the form of azide, azine, azo, hydrazine, 

nitrate, nitrite, etc.  

TKN determinations followed the procedure described in Section 4500-Norg B of the Standard 

Methods [Eaton et al., 2005], and as equipment it was used a Kjeldatherm block-digestion-

system and a Vapodest 20 s distillation system, both from Gerhardt, and an automatic titrator 

Metrohm 876 Dosimat Plus. 

The method to determine TKN consists of heating the sample with sulfuric acid, which 

decomposes the organic substance by oxidation to liberate the reduced nitrogen as ammonium 

sulfate. In this step, potassium sulfate is added to increase the boiling point of the medium and 

cupric sulfate is used as catalyst. After samples digestion, a small quantity of sodium hydroxide 

is added and the resulting ammonia solution is distilled from an alkaline medium, after adding 

a boric acid solution in the presence of a mixture of indicators (methyl red and methylene 

blue). The ammonia present in the sample, corresponding to the amount of nitrogen contained 

in the initial sample, reacts with the boric acid, and is determined indirectly by the titration 

of the borate ion formed with a H2SO4 standard solution. 



33 

 

The determination of ammonia nitrogen followed the procedure described in Section 4500-NH3 

B and Section 4500-NH3 C of the Standard Methods [Eaton et al., 2005], using the same 

distillation and titration systems used to determine TKN. The determination of ammonia 

nitrogen is similar to the determination of Kjeldahl nitrogen, although in this case the sample 

does not undergo digestion. For AN determinations, samples were buffered at pH 9.5 using a 

borate buffer to decrease hydrolysis of cyanates and organic nitrogen compounds. Then, they 

were distilled into a boric acid solution, containing the mixture of indicators used in TKN 

determination, and titrated with a standard H2SO4 0.1 M solution. 

4.1.2.6 Ion chromatography 

Ion chromatography is a process that allows the separation of ions based on their affinity to the 

ion exchanger. The basic process of ion chromatography can be represented in four steps: 

eluent loading to equilibrate the column, sample injection, separation of sample, and elution 

of the analyte. Elution is the process by which the compound of interest is moved through the 

column. This happens because the eluent is constantly pumped through the column. Ion 

chromatography retains the analyte ions on the column based on coulombic interactions. The 

stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups that interact with analyte ions of 

opposite charge. As the sample elutes through the column, the analyte ions interact differently 

with the stationary phase. The affinity of the ions present in the sample with the stationary 

phase depends primarily on the ion charge and radius. 

In section 4.3, ion exclusion chromatography was used in the determination of carboxylic acids. 

It was performed using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC apparatus coupled with a Shimadzu SPD M20A 

diode array detector. Acids were separated using an Aminex HPX – 87H of Bio-Rad (7.8 mm ID 

× 300 mm) column at 35 ºC. The elution was performed in isocratic mode using an aqueous 

solution of 4 mM of sulfuric acid as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min?1. The sample 

volume injected was 100 µL. The detection wavelength was 210 nm. The concentrations of the 

different ions were determined using calibration curves, prepared with standard solutions. 

In section 4.4 and 4.5, ion chromatography was used in the determination of Cl?, NO3
?, NO2

? 

and NH4
+ ions. It was performed using a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC apparatus coupled with a 

Shimadzu CDD 10Avp conductivity detector. Anions were separated using an IC I-524A Shodex 

(4.6 mm ID × 100 mm) column at 40 ºC. The elution was performed in isocratic mode using an 

aqueous solution of 2.5 mM of phthalic acid and 2.3 mM of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 

as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min?1. For the determination of the NH4
+, an IC YK-

A Shodex (4.6 mm ID × 100 mm) column at 40 ºC was used. The isocratic elution mode was used 

and the mobile phase was a 5.0 mM tartaric acid, 1.0 mM dipicolinic acid and 24 mM boric acid 

aqueous solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min?1. For both analyses, the sample volume injected 

was 20 µL. The retention time of the ions determined were the following: Cl? - 2.32 min; 



34 

 

NO3
? - 3.89 min, NO2

? - 2.78 min and NH4
+ - 5.13 min. The concentrations of the different ions 

were determined using calibration curves, prepared with standard solutions. 

4.1.2.7 Voltammetric studies 
 

The cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed with a potentiostat/galvanostat 

VoltaLab PGZ 301, in a one-compartment cell, with a 10 cm2 anode prepared as the working 

electrode, a 5 cm2 (per side) platinum plate as the counter electrode and a commercial 

saturated Ag/AgCl, KClsat electrode as the reference electrode. Voltammograms were recorded 

at scan rate 0.5 50 mV s?1 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.  

 
4.1.2.8 Other parameters 

? pH 

In this work, the pH of the samples, thermostatised at 20 ºC, was measured using a pH meter 

HANNA (HI 931400). 

? Conductivity 

Conductivity is a measure of the ability of an aqueous solution to carry an electric current. This 

ability depends on the presence of ions, on their total concentration and mobility, and on the 

temperature. In this work, samples conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter 

Mettler Toledo (SevenEasy S30K). Before measurement samples were kept at 20 ºC. 

? UV-Vis absorption spectrophotometry 

UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry uses light in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. The 

absorption or reflectance in the visible range directly affects the perceived colour of the 

chemicals involved. In this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, molecules undergo 

electronic transitions. According to Beer-Lambert law, the absorbance of a solution is directly 

proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution and the pathlength. 

Thus, for a fixed pathlength, UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry can be used to determine 

the concentration of the absorber in a solution.  

In this work, UV–Vis absorbance was measured from 200 to 800 nm using a Shimatzu UV-1800 

spectrophotometer. The method was used to determine the variation in the absorbance of the 

samples, as well as in the content of aromatic compounds during the electrodegradation assays.

4.2 The oxygen evolution reaction at Sn-Sb oxide anodes 

  

The oxygen evolution reaction is one of the most intensively studied electrochemical reactions 

due to its importance in practical applications such as water electrolysis, chloralkali cells, fuel 

cells, and secondary metal air batteries. 

The OER is a very interesting process because of its high activation overpotentials in aqueous 

solutions [Wu et al., 2011]. 

The anodic activity of an electrode material depends on the oxygen evolution overpotential. If 

the material is to be used in the production of oxygen from the water electrooxidation reaction, 

there are advantages in choosing materials with a low overpotential for oxygen evolution so 

that the energy consumption becomes lower. Additionally, at these materials, the direct anodic 

oxidation of pollutants occurs with high efficiency for low current densities [Armenta-Armenta 

and Diaz, 2005] because if the current density is high, a significant decrease in the current 

efficiency is expected due to oxygen evolution. However, it was demonstrated that the 

electrochemical combustion of most of the organic compounds only occurs without the loss of 

electrode activity at anode materials with high overpotential for oxygen evolution [Comninellis, 

1994]. 

In this study, the apparent activation energy for the water oxidation at the different materials 

was determined. The electrode materials utilized were the following: 

Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 (described in Ciríaco et al., 2011); Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 (described in section 3.2); 

Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3 (described in section 3.3; Ti/SnO2-Sb (described in section 3.4; Ti/Pt/SnO2-

Sb (described in section 3.5 and Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb (described in section 3.6). 

 

4.2.1 Experimental results 

 

Figure 18, presents the voltammograms of the anodic currents obtained with one set of the five 

new electrode materials prepared in this work, as well as with one electrode material prepared 

according to literature [Santos et al., 2013], for five different temperatures, up to the oxygen 

evolution region. Regarding the type of Sn and Sb electrodeposition, simultaneous or alternate, 

and the existence or absence of a Pt or Cu interlayer, the following conclusions can be obtained: 

the introduction of a Pt or a Cu metallic interlayer leads to an increase in the current intensity 

values due to the increase in the conductivity of the substrates Ti/Pt and Ti/Cu relative to the 

Ti. When the metallic interlayer is the same, the electrodes of the composite material of Sn 

and Sb oxides present lower current intensity for equal applied potential, indicating that the 

presence of only one predominant phase increases the current intensity. The presence of two 

distinct phases introduces more resistance in the grain boundaries; however, the real surface 

area has also an important role in the current intensity. In Figure 18, c and d, it can be observed 

that, simultaneously to the oxygen evolution, Pt can be oxidized, leading to distinct behaviors 

in the voltammogram profiles of the platinized and not-platinized electrodes [Wiberg and 



36 

 

Arenz, 2012]. In the voltammograms presented in Figure 18, e and f, before oxygen evolution, 

an anodic peak can be observed, which can be attributed to the copper oxidation. 

To better visualize the potential window and the relative intensities at the same applied 

potential for the different Sn-Sb materials, a comparison of the obtained voltammograms for 

different temperatures are 25 and 65 ºC is depicted in Figure 19. The highest potential window 

is presented by the electrode materials prepared without a metallic interlayer, followed by 

that with a Pt interlayer and finally that with a Cu interlayer. Regarding the preparation mode, 

the simultaneous electrodeposition of Sn and Sb slightly decreases the potential window.     

To study the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction on the surface of the different 

prepared anodes, steady-state polarization curves were conducted at temperatures ranging 

from 25 to 65 ºC in aqueous 1 M KOH solutions at the anodic potential limit of the 

electrochemical window. This reaction at the Sn-Sb anodes’ surfaces (MOx) can be represented 

by the following mechanism [Lyons and Brandon, 2008]: 

MOx + OH- ? MOx-OH + e-        (3) 

MOx-OH + OH- ?MOx-O- + H2O        (4) 

MOx-O- ?MOx-O + e-         (5) 

2 MOx-O ? 2 MOx + O2         (6) 

where equation (3) is the rate determining step.

65 ºC using different electrode materials: (a) Ti/SnO2-Sb; (b) Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4; (c) Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb; (d) 
Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4; (e) Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb; (f) Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3. Scan rate 0.5 mV s

-1. 

 

Because the Tafel plots of log j, where j is the current density, versus the overpotential, ?, 

presented two different slopes, one for low overpotential and another for high overpotential, 

all of the calculations were made at two different ranges of current density for all of the tested 

materials and for temperatures ranging from 25 to 65 ºC. The corresponding overpotentials for 

the different anode materials, used for the three sets of electrode materials, are presented in 

Table 1. This table also contains Tafel slopes and exchange current densities, j0, determined 

from the Tafel plots for one set of freshly prepared materials at all experimental conditions. 

From Table 1, it can be seen that j0 and the Tafel slopes are higher for the highest overpotential 

region and for higher temperatures. According to Montilla et al. (2004), the existence of two 

different Tafel slopes, for low and high overpotentials, may be related with the change in the 

valence state of the active sites of the anode materials. Thus, the active sites partially 



38 

 

inactivated for low overpotential or lower temperatures can be activated in the high 

overpotential region and at higher temperatures [Kibria and Tarafdar, 2002].  

 
Figure 19. Cyclic voltammograms performed with 1 M KOH solutions at different temperatures, for 
different electrode materials. Scan rate 0.5 mV s-1. 

 

The anodes that present higher catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction are those 

that present lower overpotential and higher j0. From Figure 19, it can be seen that the anodes 

with better electrocatalytic properties for this reaction are those with a copper interlayer, 

followed by those with a platinum interlayer. The anodes without a metallic interlayer have 



39 

 

the poorest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. However, the latter are the most 

efficient for the oxidation of organic pollutants, with lower energy loss in water electrolysis. 

The Tafel slope depends on the electrodes’ surface characteristics and on the reaction 

mechanism. The materials that present higher increases in the Tafel slope between low and 

high overpotential are those having antimony in the form of Sb(III) and that can be partially 

oxidized to Sb(V) at higher overpotential, increasing the adsorption of OH-. However, this is not 

the only factor that can affect the Tafel slope because for high roughness factors, an increase 

in the active sites can decrease the Tafel slope. When similar anodes prepared by the two 

different methods are compared, those presenting higher roughness have lower Tafel slopes. 

To determine the apparent activation energy, log j0 was plotted versus 1/T(K) for the three 

sets of the different anode materials at low and high overpotentials. These Arrhenius plots are 

presented in Figure 20 for one set of freshly prepared materials. From these Arrhenius plots, 

apparent activation energies for the oxygen evolution reaction at the Sn-Sb materials, for low 

and high overpotentials, were attained and are presented as mean values in Table 2. The 

apparent activation energies standard errors presented are mainly due to differences between 

the Tafel slopes and the j0 obtained for the two sets of the freshly prepared materials. The 

apparent activation energies values are distributed into two groups: one that presents values 

similar to the value reported for the oxygen evolution reaction on Pt in acid medium, 47 kJ mol-1 

[Chernaya et al., 2005], and the other with values higher than 160 kJ mol-1, suggesting that 

adsorption on the surface of these latter materials is more difficult to attain. Values higher 

than 47 kJ mol-1 were also obtained by Suffredii et al. (2004) for this reaction at boron-doped 

diamond anodes in acidic media.

From the data collected in Tables 1 and 2, the following conclusions can be drawn: the values 

of 73 and 51 kJ mol-1 presented by Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb are similar to that presented by a Pt electrode 

because the Sn-Sb film is very thin, as shown in Figure 12, where the lines attributed to Pt are 

very intense, showing a poor coverage of the Pt interlayer; for equal substrate and interlayer, 

the material with higher roughness factor presents lower apparent activation energy because a 

higher specific surface area favors adsorption; the highest difference in apparent activation 

energy observed for low and high ? for Ti/SnO2-Sb and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 is related with the Ti 

or Pt oxidations, respectively, which may occur simultaneously with the oxygen evolution; the 

materials prepared with a copper interlayer are those that present the lowest differences in 



42 

 

apparent activation energy among them, probably because the influence of the interlayer is a 

dominant factor, and Cu oxidation must have a lower activation energy than Ti or Pt oxidations.

4.2.2 Conclusions 

Several electrode materials based on tin and antimony oxides were prepared by two different 

methods and with different substrates/interlayers. Depending on the preparation method, 

different phases were identified by XRD: when the Sn and Sb electrodepositions were 

alternated, the formation of distinct SnO2 and Sb2O4 or Sb2O3 phases was observed; for 

simultaneous Sn and Sb electrodepositions, the main phase observed was SnO2. The roughness 

of the prepared materials strongly depends on the roughness of the substrate/interlayer and 

on the thickness of the deposited layer, more than on the deposition method. The material that 

presented the highest roughness was Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb prepared over a Pt interlayer with very high 

roughness. The roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution reaction because for equal 

substrate and interlayer, the material with higher roughness factor presents lower apparent 

activation energy, probably because the higher specific surface favors adsorption and facilitates 

the rate determining step. For some of the prepared materials, namely Ti/SnO2-Sb and 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, a large difference was observed between the apparent activation energies 

calculated for low and high overpotentials, which is related to the Ti or Pt oxidation that can 

occur simultaneously with oxygen evolution. The lowest apparent activation energy for oxygen 

evolution was observed for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb, the material that presented the highest roughness 

factor. The materials containing a copper interlayer presented very similar apparent activation 

energy for the oxygen evolution reaction. These materials also presented the lowest potentials 

for oxygen evolution, in particular the oxide prepared over a Cu interlayer with simultaneous 

Sn,Sb electrodepositions. Thus, for the tested materials, the most appropriate for oxygen 

evolution is Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb.

4.3 Anodic oxidation of diclofenac 

 

This subchapter presents the results obtained in a study performed to test Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb as 

anode in the electrochemical degradation of a pharmaceutical compound - diclofenac. 

 

 

4.3.1 Introduction 

 

Over the last 15 years, pharmaceuticals have received increasing attention as potential 

bioactive chemicals in the environment. They are considered as emerging pollutants in 

waterbodies because they still remain unregulated or are currently undergoing a regularization 

process, although the directives and legal frameworks are not yet set-up [Sirés and Brillas, 

2012]. 

Drugs are reaching the aquatic environment and, despite their very low concentrations, up 

to ?g L-1, presenting a potential hazard for human health, such as the increase of antibiotic-

resistant bacterial infections, especially in locations where advanced wastewater treatments 

are not used [Boxall et al., 2003; Chopra et al., 2001; Martinez, 2009]. In fact, there are studies 

concerning the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in the effluents of municipal sewage 

treatment plants [Hirsch et al., 1999; Kolpin et al., 2002; Kümmerer , 2009].  

Thousands of tons of pharmaceutical drugs are consumed yearly worldwide in human and 

veterinary medicine and agricultural and consumer products. An important part of these 

compounds enters into the environment from excretion after drug administration to humans 

and animals, production sites, direct disposal of excess of drugs in households and treatments 

throughout the water in fish and other animal farms [Brillas et al., 2010]. 

Diclofenac (2-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)aminophenyl]acetate ion), commercialized as sodium salt, 

is one of the most common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is extensively used for 

controlling renal colic and protecting against recurrent urinary calculi, also being present in 

numerous pharmaceutical formulations to treat various diseases. As a result of its resistance to 

biodegradation, it is one of the most frequently pollutants detected in ground waters, influents 

and effluents of sewage treatment plants, rivers and lakes around the world up to contents of 

4.4 ?g L-1 [Brillas et al., 2010]. 

Electrochemical oxidation treatment is a potential alternative method for eliminating 

pollutants with good efficiency. However, for the elimination of organic pollutants, it requires 

an anode with a high oxygen overpotential, high electrical conductivity and suitable mechanical 

and electrochemical stability.  

The main advantage of the electrochemical technologies is their environmental compatibility 

because the main reagent, the electron, is a clean reagent. Other advantages include their 

versatility, high energy efficiency, amenability to automation, easy handling because of the 

simple equipment required and safety because they operate under mild conditions [Sirés and 



44 

 

Brillas, 2012]. Brillas et al. (2010), studied degradation of diclofenac in aqueous medium by 

anodic oxidation using an undivided cell with a Pt or BDD anode. It was demonstrated that 

diclofenac was completely depleted by AO with BDD even at the very high concentrations 

assessed (175 mg L- 1). Only some carboxylic acids were accumulated in low concentrations and 

oxalic and oxamic were found to be the most persistent acids.  

In a previous work [Santos et al., 2013], our group studied the anodic degradation of Diclofenac 

with a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. After an 8 h assay, about 50% of COD and TOC removals were 

observed, with a combustion efficiency of 85% at an applied current density of 30 mA cm-2.

Electrodegradation experiments were conducted in a 250 mL undivided cell using batch mode 

with stirring. The anode was a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb electrode and the cathode a stainless steel foil, 

both electrodes being 10 cm2 in area and having a 2 cm gap between them. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb 

electrode was prepared as described in the section 3.5. All anodic oxidation assays were 

performed under galvanostatic conditions with an imposed current density of 30 mA cm?2. The 

processed solution volume was 200 mL with a diclofenac concentration of 100 mg L-1. Sodium 

sulfate aqueous solutions (0.035 M) were used as the supporting electrolyte in all experiments. 

Assays were run for 6 h, and data were collected at 1 h intervals.  

Diclofenac degradation was followed by UV-Visible absorption spectrophotometry, with 

absorbance measurements between 200 and 800 nm, and COD and TOC determinations. The 

products formed during the electrodegradation assays were followed by ion exclusion 

chromatography, for the determination of the low molecular carboxilic acids determination. 

Assays were also followed by pH and conductivity measurements.  

All of the assays were repeated twice, and COD and TOC values presented are mean values. 

 

 

4.3.3 Results and discussion 

 

Figure 21 presents the results obtained for the diclofenac electro-oxidation at a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb 

anode. After a 6-h assay, the COD and TOC removals were almost 50% (Figure 21 a and b). The 

similar reductions in COD and TOC point towards a degradation mechanism of mainly 

combustion rather than conversion. The decay in absorbance, measured at 276 nm (Figure 

21 c), where a maximum in the UV-Vis spectrum is observed (Figure 21 d), is slightly lower than 

COD and TOC decays, showing that some of the formed products may present absorbance at 

that wavelength. However, these products must be in low concentration, since the decay in 

the absorbance spectra seems very regular and do not show the formation of new absorbance 

bands.  



45 

 

There is also a decay in the pH (Figure 21 e), which is probably due to the formation of some 

carboxylic acids, well documented in the literature during this type of degradations [Panizza 

and Cerisola, 2009]. The slight reduction in the conductivity (Figure 21 e) must be due to the 

formation of some polymeric substances that precipitate when the samples are thermostated 

at the measuring temperature.

density of 30 mA cm-2, using a diclofenac concentration – 100 mg L-1 in sodium sulfate aqueous solutions, 
0.035 M. Inset of (a) – Diclofenac molecule. 

 

To analyze the variation of the mineralization degree during the assays, a plot of TOC vs. COD 

is depicted in Figure 22 [Pacheco at al., 2007]. It can be observed that after the first hour there 

is a reduction in the ?TOC/?COD slope, showing that the mineralization degree decreases, 



46 

 

probably due to the formation of some products less easily mineralized than diclofenac. Thus, 

the existence of new products with lower mineralization degree reduces the referred slope. 

To investigate the formation of carboxylic acids, samples collected during the assay were 

analyzed by ion exclusion chromatography, and the results are presented in Figure 23. To better 

visualize in the same figure the plots collected at different times, the HPLC spectrum baseline 

was gradually increased with assay time. In fact, the formation of several different carboxylic 

acids can be observed, namely oxamic acid formed from the amino group of the diclofenac 

molecule. Since the carboxylic acid concentrations did not vary significantly during the assay, 

it may be concluded that the diclofenac molecule is first broken into small very oxidized 

metabolites, the acids that are then mineralized, keeping acids concentration almost constant.

4.3.4 Conclusions 

 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb electrode has proved to be a suitable material for the electro-oxidation of 

organic compounds. In fact, the diclofenac anodic oxidation was successfully attained at this 

anode material. After more than 200 working hours, the material presented reproducible 

results, showing that this is a material with potentialities for environmental applications.   

Medium COD and TOC removals, close to 50%, were obtained after 6 h assay. However, in similar 

experimental conditions, COD and TOC removals obtained at a BDD electrode were higher 

[Santos et al., 2014b].   

The similarity between COD and TOC removal rates points to a high degree of mineralization of 

the diclofenac molecule that is corroborated by the gradual decay of the UV-Visible spectra 

along the time. The main by-products identified by ion exclusion chromatography were oxalic, 

maleic and oxamic acids, the last one formed from the amino group of the diclofenac molecule. 

Vestigial quantities of formic and acetic acids were also found.

4.4 Nitrogen and organic load removal from sanitary landfill 

leachates by anodic oxidation at Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes 

 
 
In this subchapter, the oxidation ability of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes for the treatment of a 

biologically pretreated sanitary landfill leachate is accessed. To understand the elimination of 

the different forms of nitrogen present in the leachate samples, assays were also performed 

with simulated samples, having only different N-containing compounds, without organic 

matter. This work was already published in a scientific journal [Fernandes et al., 2014]. 

 

4.4.1 Introduction 

 

Recently, several studies have been reported the application of advanced oxidation 

technologies for the treatment of sanitary landfill leachates. Landfill leachate is one of the 

major environmental problems concerning water pollution, and conventional treatments have 

been inefficient in the treatment of this type of wastewater [Abbas et al., 2009; Eggen et al., 

2010; Öman et al., 2008]. Due to its effectiveness and ease of operation, the application of 

electrochemical oxidation to treat these effluents has been studied, with promising results. 

The effect of several operating factors and different types of anode material, in particular 

boron-doped diamond (BDD), have been assessed [Anglada et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010].  

Anglada and co-workers [Anglada et al., 2009; Anglada et al., 2011], reported several studies 

concerning the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate using BDD anodes. In these 

studies, the effect of the applied current density, the initial concentration of chloride ions, the 

treatment time and the initial pH were analyzed. They reported that the electro-oxidation 

process of landfill leachate with BDD anodes is an efficient technology that is able to completely 

oxidize the organic matter and almost all ammonia under appropriate conditions. Their results 

showed that organic matter and ammonia oxidation are highly influenced by the applied current 

density, indicating a change in the mechanism of the organic matter oxidation when high 

current densities are applied. Moreover, the concentration of chloride has an effect on the 

oxidation of ammonia, and chloride ions compete with organic matter to be oxidized at the 

anode. Similar conclusions were reported by Cabeza et al. (2007 a and b) and Urtiaga et al. 

(2012). These authors observed that ammonium oxidation occurs at a slower rate than chemical 

oxygen demand (COD) decay and that chlorine evolution is enhanced at lower COD values, 

causing the indirect oxidation of ammonium. These authors also observed that when additional 

chloride ions were provided, the treatment efficiency increased. 

The formation of inorganic oxidation by-products during the electrocatalytic treatment of 

ammonium from landfill leachates with BDD anodes was assessed by Pérez and co-workers 

[Pérez et al., 2012]. It was found that ammonium oxidation leads to the formation of nitrogen 

gas and nitrate as the main oxidation products. Higher chloride concentrations have a positive 



49 

 

influence on the formation of nitrogen as the main oxidation product. When high chloride 

concentrations (5-20 g L-1) were used in the presence of ammonium, chloride remained almost 

constant because it was regenerated during the indirect oxidation reactions. 

Other studies performed with BDD anodes [Fernandes et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013; 

Urtiaga et al., 2009; Urtiaga et al., 2012] confirm that the anodic oxidation can be an efficient 

alternative/complement to treat sanitary landfill leachates. However, despite these good 

results, BDD anodes present a significant disadvantage: they are expensive. Thus, the use of 

different electrode materials that are less costly than BDD for the electrochemical oxidation of 

sanitary landfill leachates has been reported by several authors. Cossu et al. (1998) described 

the electrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate with two different anode materials, Ti/PbO2 

and Ti/SnO2. No significant differences were found in the behaviors of the two anode materials. 

An average current efficiency of 30% was measured for a decrease of COD from 1200 to 150 

mg L-1. The results indicated that the organic load was removed by both direct and indirect 

oxidation. Indirect oxidation by chlorine or hypochlorite originated from chloride oxidation was 

believed to be responsible for the nitrogen removal. 

The indirect oxidation effect in the electrochemical oxidation treatment of landfill leachate 

using different anode materials was also studied by Chiang et al. (1995). These authors observed 

that the electrocatalytic behavior of the anode material strongly affects the 

chlorine/hypochlorite production efficiency. Moreover, there is a correlation between the COD 

removal efficiency and chlorine/hypochlorite production, and because COD and ammonium 

were removed simultaneously by the indirect oxidation effect during electrolysis, there is a 

competition between the removal of COD and ammonium.  

Panizza et al. (2010) reported the anodic oxidation of a real leachate using a lead dioxide 

anode. The results indicated that the organic compounds were mainly removed by indirect 

oxidation by the active chlorine generated from chloride oxidation. 

A comparative study between different anode materials, including Ti–Ru–Sn ternary oxide, PbO2 

and BDD, for the electrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate was also performed [Panizza 

and Martinez-Huitle, 2013]. The experimental results indicated that after 8 h of electrolysis, 

the Ti-Ru-SnO2 anode yields only 35% COD, 52% color and 65% ammonium removal. Using PbO2, 

ammonium and color were completely removed, but residual COD was present. On the contrary, 

BDD enables complete COD, color and ammonium removal and also exhibits greater current 

efficiency along with a significantly lower energy cost compared to the other electrodes. 

Most of the PbO2 and SnO2 electrodes implemented in previous studies used a titanium foil 

substrate that may oxidize during the anodic oxidation of the leachates, leading to the 

formation of an insulating titanium oxides layer that inactivates the electrode [Montilla et al., 

2004; Río et al., 2009]. This insulating layer may be avoided by depositing a Pt layer over the 

titanium foil prior to deposition of the metallic oxide [Andrade et al., 2007]. The anode 

materials thus obtained, Ti/Pt/PbO2 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, have been successfully prepared 

and used by our research group in the electrochemical degradation of several pharmaceutical 

drugs [Ciríaco et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013].

4.4.2 Experimental details 

 

4.4.2.1 Samples preparation and characterization 

The landfill leachate used in this study was collected from the intermunicipal sanitary landfill 

facility of Cova da Beira, Portugal. This site, which serves a population of over 220,000 

inhabitants in 13 municipalities, has an onsite facility capable of treating up to 50 m3 of 

leachate daily. The raw leachate was initially treated on site by an activated sludge process. 

The characteristics of the biologically pretreated leachate are presented in Table 3. 

Simulated samples were prepared as follows: NH4NO3 - 0.232 g, NH4Cl - 1.605 g, CaCl2 - 0.7 g, 

MgCl2.6H2O - 1.42 g, NaCl - 2.472 g and KCl - 2.0986 g and distilled water up to 1 L.

4.4.2.2 Electrodegradation experiments 

Experiments were conducted in batch mode, with stirring, using 200 mL of solution. A 10 cm 2 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was used as anode, and 10 cm
2 stainless steel foil was used as 

cathode, being the gap between them 2.0 cm. Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was prepared as 

described in the section 3.2 [Santos et al., 2013]. Experiments were conducted at an applied 

current intensity of 0.3 A, at room temperature (22-25 ºC) without the addition of a background 

electrolyte. A Multimetrix XA 3033 unit was used as the power supply.  

Simulated samples were prepared as follows: NH4NO3 - 0.232 g, NH4Cl - 1.605 g, CaCl2 - 0.7 g, 

MgCl2.6H2O - 1.42 g, NaCl - 2.472 g and KCl - 2.0986 g and distilled water up to 1 L.

All the electrochemical tests were performed at least in triplicate. The mean values are 

presented for the parameters used to follow the assays: COD, DOC, TN, TKN, AN, and chloride, 

nitrate and nitrite concentrations. 

  

4.4.3 Results and discussion 

Figure 24, a and b, presents the results for the variation with time of the normalized COD and 

DOC obtained from the experiments performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. The variation of 

the normalized COD with electrical energy consumption is also presented (Figure 24 d). It can 

be observed that DOC removal was lower than COD removal. This behavior has been reported 

previously in the literature and has been explained by the formation of low molecular weight 

organic compounds with high degrees of oxidation that resist to further oxidation [Anglada et 

al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2012]. The conversion of the organic matter into more oxidized by-

products rather than resulting in mineralization promoted by Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes must be 

due to the fact that hydroxyl radicals are expected to be strongly adsorbed on the electrode’s 

surface.  

When experimental COD evolution with time (Figure 24 c) is compared with the theoretical 

trend Eq. (7) according to the model previously proposed in the literature for electrolysis under 

current limited control [Panizza et al., 2001], where I is the current intensity in A, F is the 

Faraday constant and V is the volume in m3, it can be seen that the experimental results 

obtained for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 are slightly better. This result is due to the electrocatalytic 

effect of the platinum because despite being covered by the metal oxides, platinum peaks are 

always detected by X-ray diffraction [Ciríaco et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013], probably due to 

the porosity of the oxide film.

When the normalized COD is plotted against the electrical energy consumption (Figure 24 d) 

calculated based on the potential difference mean values, which was 6.2 V, an increase in the 

energy consumption with COD decay can be observed. This happens for two main reasons: the 

easier degradable compounds goes first, and as the assay proceeds, the effect of mass 

transportation becomes more important, reducing COD removal rate.

consumption. Error bars refer to the standard deviation of the normalized mean values. 

 

Figure 25 shows the results obtained for the nitrogen removal in the experiments performed 

with real leachate, where similar TN and TKN decays can be observed. AN removal is more 

pronounced, especially in the last hours of the assays, showing that Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes 

are more effective in the removal of the ammonium nitrogen.

performed with real leachate using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes. Error bars refer to the standard deviation 
of the normalized mean values. 

 

Comparing the COD (Figure 24 a) and AN (Figure 25) profiles during the anodic oxidation runs, 

AN removal occurs at a slower rate than that of COD during the first 3 hours of the assays. 

However, when the COD value decreases to approximately 70% of the initial concentration, the 

AN removal rate increases. Similar results can be found in the literature. Cossu et al. (1998), 

using a Ti/Pt anode, reported that the removal rate of AN was lower than that of COD at the 

initial stage of electro-oxidation and that AN was substantially removed in the subsequent 

electrochemical oxidation stage when indirect oxidation became prevalent. This increase in 

indirect oxidation may be enhanced by the formation of HClO or chlorine from chloride [Anglada 

et al., 2009; Chiang et al., 1995]. According to Chiang et al. (1995) ammonium reacts with 

HClO through the following ‘‘breakpoint reactions’’ that regenerate chloride ions:  

HClO + NH4
+    ?  NH2Cl + H2O + H

+       (8) 

HClO + NH2Cl ? NHCl2 + H2O        (9) 

NHCl2 + H2O ? NOH + 2H
+ + 2Cl-       (10) 

NHCl2 + NOH ? N2 + HClO + H
+ + Cl-       (11) 

In fact, chloride concentration, determined by ionic chromatography, is always higher for the 

assays performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode (Figure 26 a), indicating that this ion may be 

involved in the oxidation of ammonium and may be regenerated after that process. 

Additionally, this metal oxide anode is very effective in total nitrogen removal, showing that 

nitrogen gas is being formed at a high rate, being very effective at partially oxidizing ammonia 

to nitrate (Figure 26 b) [Cabeza et al., 2007a]. Regarding nitrites (Figure 26 c), they are 

completely eliminated during the anodic oxidation.

Sb2O4 anode. (d) Mass balance of the different forms of nitrogen determined in solution during the assays. 
Error bars refer to the standard deviation of the mean values.  

 

The mass balance to all nitrogen forms determined during the assays performed with the 

different electrode materials is presented in Figure 26 d. A discrepancy is observed only for the 

final period of the assays, although the zero value is always contained in the interval of the 

value?SD. 

Biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days of incubation was determined for samples obtained 

after 6 h of electrochemical treatment with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, and a value of 0.40 ? 

0.05 g L-1 was obtained. This value led to BOD5/COD ratio of 0.11 ? 0.02, indicating that the 

biodegradability of the samples after 6 h of anodic oxidation did not improve, and was even 

slightly worse. This issue occurs because matter that is more difficult to electrolyze is also less 

biodegradable and because the presence of chlorine/hypochlorite may also alter the BOD5 

results, since these species can deactivate microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation.  

After the electrochemical treatment, there were reductions of 42% in the absorbance measured 

at 275 nm and reductions of 8.6% in the conductivity for the assays performed with Ti/Pt/SnO2-

Sb2O4 anodes. The reduction in the absorbance is due to the removal/degradation of aromatic 

structures by anodic oxidation in materials with high oxygen evolution potentials that produce 

high concentrations of hydroxyl radicals [Panizza et al., 2001], whereas the decrease in 

conductivity is due to metal deposition over the cathode, caused by the cathodic reduction of 

the metal ions present in the leachate samples, and also due to the elimination of other ions, 



55 

 

like ammonium to give nitrogen gas [Fernandes et al., 2014b]. Regarding the pH variation during 

the assays, it was almost constant, within an acceptable range for experimental error.    

To understand the effect of organic matter on the elimination of ammonium nitrogen, assays 

were run using simulated solutions containing chloride, nitrates and ammonium in 

concentrations similar to those encountered in the leachate samples. The results are presented 

in Figure 27. The elimination rate of chloride is enhanced because there is no competition with 

the organic matter for oxidation. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals are free to convert ammonium, 

which does not participate in equations (8) to (11) and which does regenerate chloride ions. 

Also, removals in ammonium and total nitrogen are increased and nitrate formation rate is 

decreased, showing that this metal oxide is effective in the complete elimination of nitrogen 

from solution via the partial oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen.

+ and (d) TN concentrations for the anodic 
oxidation experiments performed with the simulated sample using a Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode. Error bars 
refer to the standard deviation of the mean values.  

 

After the electrochemical treatment performed with this simulated solution, there were 

reductions in conductivity of approximately 20% for the assays performed, due to the oxidation 

of species with high conductivity, such as ammonium and chloride, and the formation of nitrate, 

which has lower conductivity than ammonium. The increase in pH (from 6.1 ? 0.1 to 7.5 ? 0.1) 

also contributed to the decrease in conductivity.

4.4.4 Conclusions 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes, which had already been used with good results in the degradation of 

pharmaceutical compounds [Ciríaco et al., 2011], prove to be also very effective in the 

degradation of very complex mixtures, such as leachates from sanitary landfills. Its 

effectiveness was proved with COD removal rates higher than the theoretical one. Also, it can 

be a good material for the elimination of N-containing compounds, with a good TN removal, 

which means that part of the nitrogen is eliminated as nitrogen forms. It also promotes 

elimination of the organic load by indirect oxidation with chlorine oxidizing species. Although 

a Pt layer makes the material more expensive than a Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, and a less efficient 

in the COD removal [Santos et al., 2013], it can strategically increase the electrode lifetime; 

the electrodes used in this work were tested for more than 1000 h. 

When the results of the oxidation ability to remove nitrogen and organic load from biologically 

pretreated sanitary landfill leachates obtained with Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anodes are compared 

with those from Ti/Pt/PbO2, and BDD [Fernandes et al., 2014a; Fernandes, 2014] the following 

conclusions can be drawn: 

• They all present similar COD removal kinetics, although BDD anode promotes the 

highest DOC removal, leading to a higher mineralization degree. This must be due to its inert 

surface where hydroxyl radicals, responsible for the indirect oxidation, are less strongly 

adsorbed than at the metal oxides surfaces.  

• Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 promotes TN and AN removals higher than BDD and lower than 

Ti/Pt/PbO2. This effect occurs because at metallic oxides, the partial oxidation of ammonium 

to nitrogen gas occurs, whereas for BDD, ammonium is oxidized to nitrate. On the other hand, 

it shows lower appetency than BDD shows for TKN removal.  

• Metallic oxide anodes demonstrate low energy consumption because they are more 

conductive than BDD and also due to the electrocatalytic effect of the oxides. 

Thus, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 can be a good alternative as anode materials for the treatment of 

sanitary landfill leachates.

4.5 Electrochemical oxidation of humic acid and sanitary 

landfill leachate: Influence of anode material, chloride 

concentration and current density  

 

Following the study presented in section 4.4 of this thesis, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode was 

utilized to study the influence of the applied current density and of the chloride ion 

concentration on the oxidation of a raw sanitary landfill leachate and, to better understand 

the influence of the experimental conditions on the elimination of organic matter and nitrogen 

in the presence of recalcitrant compounds, synthetic samples containing humic acid and 

inorganic salts, with COD and ammonium ion contents similar to that of the real leachate, were 

also prepared and subjected to electro-oxidation. Humic acid was chosen to prepare the 

synthetic samples because it has recalcitrant properties and, according to the literature, 

sanitary landfill leachates present a high content in humic substances [Bhalla et al., 2013; Foo 

and Hameed, 2009; Kang et al., 2002]. Besides humic acid, synthetic samples contained as 

nitrogen and chloride sources ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride.   

This study was already published in specialized literature [Fernandes et al., 2016].  

 

 

4.5.1 Introduction 

Electrochemical oxidation is the most popular electrochemical procedure for removing organic 

pollutants from wastewaters (Brillas and Martínez-Huitle, 2015) and its application in the 

treatment of complex effluents, such as sanitary landfill leachates, has been reported by 

numerous authors with promising results (Anglada et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Fernandes 

et al., 2012, 2014a, 2014b, 2015; Panizza and Martinez-Huitle, 2013; Panizza et al., 2010; Pérez 

et al., 2012; Turro et al., 2011; Urtiaga et al., 2012). Since the anode material strongly 

influences the selectivity and the efficiency of the EO process (Brillas and Martínez-Huitle, 

2015), different anode materials have been investigated, being the highest organic oxidation 

rates and the highest current efficiencies attained with boron-doped diamond electrodes 

(Anglada et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2015). This is due to the chemical, physical and 

electrochemical outstanding properties of this anode material, when compared with other 

conventional electrode materials (Fryda et al., 1999; Panizza and Cerisola, 2005). Removals of 

100% in chemical oxygen demand and ammonium nitrogen contents have been achieved for the 

EO of sanitary landfill leachates using BDD anodes (Anglada et al., 2010b; Cabeza et al., 2007a, 

2007b). However, despite the BDD electrodes exceptional properties and the good results 

obtained when this electrode is used, the most common BDD electrodes are Si-supported, which 

present difficulties related to their industrial transposition, due to the fragility and the 

relatively low conductivity of the Si substrate (Brillas and Martínez-Huitle, 2015). BDD films 

synthesized on Nb, Ta and W have also shown promising results, but their large-scale utilization 

is impossible due to the unacceptably high costs of these metal substrates (Brillas and Martínez-



58 

 

Huitle, 2015). Therefore, it is necessary to study the application of new electrode materials 

that can successfully remove the pollutants with lower capital and operational costs. Among 

the different electrode materials studied for the EO process, metal oxides have shown 

promising results, even when used to treat complex effluents such as sanitary landfill leachates 

(Chiang et al., 1995; Cossu et al., 1998; Feki et al., 2009; Fernandes et al., 2014a; Panizza et 

al., 2010; Panizza and Martinez-Huitle, 2013). A study comparing BDD and two different 

metallic oxides anodes, Ti/Pt/PbO2 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, in the EO of a sanitary landfill 

leachate showed that metal oxides anodes promoted COD removals similar to that of BDD and 

lower energy consumptions, although the difference between the COD and dissolved organic 

carbon removals for BDD was less pronounced than for the other anodes, suggesting that BDD 

promotes more easily the complete combustion of the organic matter (Fernandes et al., 2014a). 

Also, regarding nitrogen removal, metal oxide anodes were found to be more effective in the 

ammonium removal, whereas BDD was more efficient in the organic nitrogen removal 

(Fernandes et al., 2014b). In a similar study, Panizza and Martinez-Huitle (2013) compared the 

performance of BDD, PbO2 and Ti-Ru-SnO2 and different results were achieved, since BDD 

yielded complete COD, color and AN removal, whereas with PbO2 a residual COD remained and, 

when Ti-Ru-SnO2 was used, the organic pollutants were only partially oxidized. Also, faster 

oxidation rate, higher current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption were achieved 

using the BDD anode, resulting, consequently, in lower treatment costs (Panizza and Martinez-

Huitle, 2013). Although the results presented by Fernandes et al. (2014a) and Panizza and 

Martinez-Huitle (2013) were different, it must be noticed that whereas the leachate samples 

used by the first authors presented COD/AN/chloride concentrations of 6200/480/4700 mg L-1, 

the leachate samples used by the second authors only had 780/266/1800 mg L-1. Also, the lead 

and stannous electrodes used by Fernandes et al. (2014a) had a Pt layer between the titanium 

foil and the metallic oxide, which was not the case of the electrode used in the other study. 

Besides the anode material, applied current density and chloride ion concentration also have 

shown to play an important role in the EO performance. Several authors reported an increase 

in COD and AN removals by increasing the applied current density or the chloride ion 

concentration (Anglada et al., 2009, 2011; Bashir et al., 2009; Cabeza et al., 2007a, 2007b; 

Chiang et al., 1995; Cossu et al., 1998; Feki et al., 2009; Moraes and Bertazzoli, 2005; Pérez 

et al., 2012; Turro et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010, 2011). In a study performed by Anglada et 

al. (2009), it was observed that an increase in the current density from 300 to 450 A m-2 scarcely 

affected the removal rate of the organic matter, but at higher current densities the oxidation 

levels increased with current density, which suggested a change in the oxidation mechanism of 

the organic matter, since at high current densities mediated electrochemical oxidation 

processes, such as indirect oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and by other electrogenerated 

oxidants, had a strong influence. Also, the influence of the applied current density was much 

more significant in the ammonium oxidation than in the COD removal, even if ammonium 

removal occurred at a slower rate than that of COD.  Different results were achieved by Zhang 

et al. (2010 and 2011) that reported an increase in the COD removal with increasing current 



59 

 

density, but only up to a certain value of current density, from which a further increase would 

lead to a decrease in the COD removal rate. This behavior was explained by the authors taken 

into account that, at lower current densities, organic matter anodic oxidation with hydroxyl 

radicals was favored against chlorine evolution at the anode, and thus the increase in current 

density would lead to the increase in COD removal rate. However, a further increase in the 

current density would enhance chlorine generation and hence the anodic oxidation with 

hydroxyl radicals would be depressed. In the meantime, the AN removal would be dominant in 

the competition between AN and COD removal by the indirect oxidation, via active chlorine, 

and, consequently, COD removal rate would decrease with current density (Zhang et al., 2010 

and 2011). The effect of the indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite species in the EO 

treatment of landfill leachates had already been studied by Chiang et al. (1995) that provided 

additional chloride ions to the leachate as supporting electrolyte during the electrolysis. The 

experimental results showed that when 2.5 g L-1 chloride was added, both COD and AN removal 

rates increased, being the AN removal rate much higher than that of COD.  

Pérez et al. (2012) identified nitrogen and nitrate as the main ammonium oxidation products 

obtained in the EO of a landfill leachate with a BDD anode: for high chloride concentration, 

nitrogen gas was the main product, having the percentage of ammonium transformed into 

nitrogen gas increased from 74 to 85%, after 4 hours, when the chloride content was increased 

from 5 to 20 g L-1, while the percentage of ammonium converted into nitrate varied from 26% 

to 15%. Also, the formation of chloramines, chlorate and perchlorate was hindered by increasing 

the initial concentration of chloride ions. 

Since the difficulties in treating complex effluents such as landfill leachates is associated to 

the presence of persistent organic pollutants, the oxidation of synthetic wastewaters with 

different test substances has been investigated. The electrochemical oxidation of synthetic 

solutions, containing glucose and humic acid using BDD anodes was performed by 

Woisetschläger et al. (2013) and the results showed that the degradation process was 

increasingly inhibited by the increase in the amount of humic acid. According to these authors, 

during the electrochemical oxidation, hydroxyl radicals primarily react with organic substances 

to form partially oxidized intermediate products and carbon dioxide. Retardation and inhibition 

of these reactions due to mass transport limitations or because of the low reactivity of 

constituents will preferably lead to the decomposition of hydroxyl radicals as gaseous oxygen. 

As a consequence, the dissolved oxygen content increases, leading to low current efficiency 

and COD removal. 

 

4.5.2 Experimental details 

 

4.5.2.1 Sanitary landfill leachate and humic acid synthetic samples 

The landfill leachate samples (L) used in this study were collected from an intermunicipal 

sanitary landfill facility in Portugal. This site, with an area of approximately 7 ha, is sealed 

since 2003. The leachate samples were collected in the stabilization lagoon, before any kind of 



60 

 

treatment, and were kept refrigerated until their use, in order to maintain their initial 

characteristics. L samples characterization was performed just after the collection and just 

before their use in experiments and no significant differences on the parameter values were 

found. The characteristics of the landfill leachate are presented in Table 4. No nitrite or nitrate 

were detected in the L samples.  

In the electrodegradation assays, besides the raw leachate samples, L samples with added 

chloride (2 g L-1) were also assayed. 

The synthetic samples (S), were prepared as aqueous solutions of humic acid and inorganic salts 

presented COD and NH4
+ contents similar to the real landfill leachate samples. The inorganic 

salts utilized were ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride and potassium chloride, to provide 

the necessary amounts of ammonium and chloride. Different Cl- contents were tested, from 0 

to 4.5 g L-1. Table 5 summarizes the composition of the different S samples used in the 

experiments and Table 4 presents the physicochemical characteristics of the S samples before 

the chloride addition.  

All the reagents used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used 

without additional purification.

4.5.2.2 Electrodegradation experiments 

Experiments were conducted in batch mode, with stirring, using 200 mL of solution. A 10 cm2 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 plate was used as anode, and 10 cm
2 stainless steel plate was used as cathode, 

with a 2.0 cm gap between them. Assays were performed with synthetic and real leachate 

samples at applied current densities of 300 and 700 A m-2, using a GW, Lab DC, model GPS-

3030D (0–30 V, 0–3 A) as power supply. Synthetic and leachate samples with different chloride 

concentrations were assayed. 

All the electrochemical tests were performed at least in duplicate. The mean values are 

presented for the parameters used to follow the assays: COD, DOC, TN, TKN, AN, and chloride, 

nitrate and nitrite concentrations. 

 

4.5.3 Results and discussion 

Figure 28 present the results for the variation with time of COD and DOC for the experiments 

performed with synthetic and sanitary landfill leachate samples, with different initial Cl- 

concentrations and for the different applied current densities, utilizing as anode material 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4. For L samples, the chloride concentration of 2.5 g L
-1 corresponds to samples 

where no chloride was added, since this was the chloride concentration in the raw leachate 

(Table 4). 

 



62 

 

 
Figure 28. Variation with time of the COD (a,b,c) and DOC (d,e,f) removed in the electrodegradation 
experiments performed with synthetic (S) and leachate (L) samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two 
applied current densities, 300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  

 

Figure 28, a to c, shows that when S samples were used, for both applied current densities 

studied, the presence of Cl- influenced the COD removal, since in the assays without chloride 

COD removal rate was much lower than for the assays performed with the addition of chloride. 

However, the increase in chloride initial concentration from 2.5 to 4.5 g L-1 did not introduce 

meaningful changes in the COD removal rates, at both applied current densities, meaning that 

the increment on the chloride concentration did not significantly increase the indirect oxidation 

through chlorine/hypochlorite. This fact must be related with an optimum COD/[Cl-] ratio, and 

an extra addition of chloride does not result in an increase in COD removal rate, because part 

of the applied current is spent in the chloride oxidation and intermediate compounds more 

resistant to oxidation may also be formed, in particular at low j. In fact, according to the 

medium mass transfer coefficients presented in the literature for leachate samples (Anglada et 

al., 2011; Fernandes et al., 2012), the current densities used are lower than the limiting current 

density for the initial COD value (738 A m-2 &amp;lt; jlim &amp;lt;1156 A m
-2). Thus, the process is under 

kinetic control most of the time, and only when COD removals are high the process becomes 

diffusion controlled. 

The inexistence of a positive effect due to the increase in [Cl-] from 2.5 ad 4.5 g L-1 was also 

observed for the L samples, where the effect of the current density was much more significant 



63 

 

than the increase in chloride concentration. Regarding the influence of the current density, for 

the assay performed with S samples without chloride, COD removal rate decreased with j. This 

behavior has been reported in the literature and has been explained by the increased 

production in oxidizing species with the operating current density (Chiang et al., 1995). The 

existence of such species is determinant due to the growing relevance of the diffusional step 

with j. Thus, for [Cl-] = 0 g L-1, the decrease in COD removal with the increase in j may be 

related with an enhanced oxygen evolution at higher j that may hinder the mass transfer 

process and the adsorption of the reacting species on the electrode surface. In fact, due to the 

influence of the platinum interlayer and to the higher porosity of this material, the hydroxyl 

radicals, with more expression at higher j, are more strongly adsorbed at the anode surface, 

enhancing their decomposition as gaseous oxygen. Regarding the slightly lower COD removal 

rate obtained with this material in the treatment of L samples, a similar behavior was also 

observed by Zhang et al. (2010 and 2011), due to an enhancement in the active chlorine 

generation that reduces the anodic oxidation with hydroxyl radicals. 

Concerning DOC removal for S samples, for j = 300 A m-2 (Figure 28d) there is a regular influence 

of the chloride initial concentration. This fact is due to the organic matter random oxidation in 

the bulk of the solution promoted by the active chlorine, formed by the chloride oxidation, 

that leads to low mineralization when the chloride initial concentration is low, being more 

oriented to COD removal. At higher initial chloride concentration, the excess in active chlorine 

promotes the compounds complete oxidation, leading to higher mineralization degree. The 

increase in the formation of the active chlorine with chloride initial concentration can be 

observed by the chloride concentration decay during the electrolysis (Figure 29), which 

increases with chloride initial concentration and with applied current density. Although for 700 

A m-2 the differences in the chloride concentration decay still exists, chloride concentration of 

2.5 g L-1 must be enough to indirectly oxidize most of the organic matter present in the S 

samples, being the effect of the chloride initial concentration in DOC removal (Figure 28, d to 

f) similar to what was observed for the COD removal rate.  

In the DOC removals in time, for most of the S samples, there are sudden changes in the curves’ 

slope. This is due to the formation of a precipitate, associated with a sharp drop in the pH of 

the solution (Figure 30), observed for the assays performed with S samples containing chloride. 

The formation of the precipitate interferes with DOC determination because the samples are 

filtered before analysis. The precipitation occurrence was enhanced by the increase in the Cl- 

initial concentration and applied current density. The reason why the pH drop was only 

observed in the S samples could be the buffer effect caused by carbonate in the leachate 

samples (Chiang et al., 1995). 

Regarding DOC removals for L samples (Figure 28, f), it can be observed that the increase in 

chloride initial concentration leads to an increase in the mineralization degree, since the effect 

of the increase in chloride initial concentration was obvious in the DOC removal and was 

insignificant in the COD removal.

When the variation of ammonia and total nitrogen forms present in the samples is analyzed 

(Figure 31, a to f), at any applied current density, it can be seen that, for S samples without 

added Cl-, no significant removal of the ammonium ion was observed, showing that NH4
+ removal 

takes place mainly by indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite species. Another 

possible explanation is the formation of small amounts of AN from the oxidation of the low 

organic nitrogen content, simultaneously with its consumption to give nitrates (Figure 32). This 

balance could also explain the ammonium ion irregular removal for S samples without added 

chloride (Figure 31 a and b). Similar results were found for total nitrogen (Figure 31, d to f), 

indicating that TN removal happens also by the indirect oxidation mediated by 

chlorine/hypochlorite species.

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two applied current densities, 300 and 700 A m

-2, and different initial chloride 
contents.  

 

For the S samples with initial addition of chloride and j=300 A m-2, the influence of the initial 

amount of added chloride, 2.5 or 4.5 g L-1, is very small in the ammonium ion removal (Figure 

31 a) and on the nitrate formation (Figure 32 a), but significant on the TN removal (Figure 31 

d). High TN removal was also described by Pérez et al. (2012), using a BDD anode, during the 

electrochemical oxidation of a landfill leachate. According to these authors, ammonium 

degradation takes place mainly due to the indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite, 

according to Eq. 12 and 13, being nitrogen gas the main ammonium oxidation product, leading 

to a removal in the TN content.

Regarding the assays performed with L samples, an increase in j increases ammonium ion 

removal (Figure 31 c), TN removal (Figure 31 f) and nitrate formation (Figure 32 c). The effect 

of the increase in the chloride content is not so linear, being very small for nitrate formation 

and presenting a marked influence in the ammonium ion removal, in particular for the highest 

applied j, showing the effect of the indirect oxidation. On the other hand, in TN removal at 

higher j, an increase in the chloride content presents a very clear impact, showing the 



66 

 

importance of Eq. 12 in the process. For the lowest applied j, however, the increase in chloride 

content leads to a decrease in TN removal, probably due to lower active chlorine production 

at lower electrical current, or due to a competition with the organic matter, since at low j the 

increase in chloride content deeply influences the DOC removal rate (Figure 28 f).

performed with (a,b) synthetic, S, and (c) leachate, L, samples using Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode, at two 
applied current densities, 300 and 700 A m-2, and different initial chloride contents.  
 
 

In general, comparing the results obtained for L and S samples, it can be seen that the highest 

organic load removals were achieved with S samples, while the highest nitrogen removals were 

attained for L samples. These dissimilar results are probably due to the different composition 

of the samples, since in the S samples the humic acid was the single source of organic matter, 

whereas L samples contain a lot of different organic compounds, being some of them complex 

structures of humic substances and inorganic ions (Kang et al., 2002), more resistant to 

oxidation than the humic acid itself. 

To analyze the influence of the chloride concentration on the COD and ammonium ion removals, 

the variations of the COD removed vs. [Cl-]/COD ratio and NH4
+ removed vs. [Cl-]/[ NH4

+] (Figure 

33)  were plotted for the different experimental conditions tested. Regarding the influence of 

chloride concentration on the COD removal, it can be seen that the [Cl-]/COD ratio remains 

almost constant, especially for the first hours of the assays, meaning that chlorine/hypochlorite 

resulting from the chloride ion oxidation is being consumed proportionally to the oxidation of 

the organic load and indirect oxidation through chlorine/hypochlorite is dominant. A different 

behavior is observed for the NH4
+ removal, since in L samples an increase of the [Cl-]/[NH4

+] 

ratio with time is found, whereas in S samples the plots show a general tendency for a decrease 

in time of this ratio. This behavior is consistent with the fact that NH4
+ removal rate is higher 

for L samples than for S samples, being the COD removal rate depressed for L samples and NH4
+ 

removal rate improved. This shows that indirect oxidation with chlorine/hypochlorite is even 

more important in the NH4
+ elimination than in the COD removal and that increasing Cl- initial 

concentration without using an adequate j may lead to higher [Cl-] in the final samples with 

only a small increase in the NH4
+ removal.

To analyse the influence of the applied current density and chloride ion concentration on the 

leachate treatment energetic costs, the specific energy consumptions, Esp, in W h (g COD)
-1, for 

the different assays performed with leachate samples were calculated, by means of Eq. 14, and 

are presented in Table 6. This Table also contains values from the literature for other two 

materials utilized with the same samples as those described in Table 4, and at identical 

experimental conditions.

COD, in mg L-1, during ?t. The lowest energy consumptions were achieved in assays performed 

at j = 300 A m-2 with [Cl-]0 = 4.5 g L
-1, and the highest consumptions were attained for j = 700 

A m-2 and [Cl-]0 = 2.5 g L
-1. These results were expected since the increase in chloride ion 

concentration increases the electric conductivity of the sample, and consequently the cell 

voltage decreases. On the other hand, an increase in j leads to a decrease in current efficiency. 

Among the anode materials studied, PbO2 showed the lowest energy consumptions for j = 300 

A m-2 and [Cl-]0 = 4.5 g L
-1. 

Regarding the possible leaching of heavy metals from the anode material, when metal oxide 

anodes are used, results from previous studies have shown that metal content in the 

electrolyzed solutions is negligible, either because anodes are mechanically stable (Ciríaco et 

al., 2009) or the metal ions in samples are removed by cathodic reduction, during the 

electrodegradation assays (Fernandes et al., 2014b).

4.5.4 Conclusions 

Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode proved to be very effective in the electrooxidation of humic acid and 

sanitary landfill leachates, with a performance similar to that of BDD [Fernandes et al., 2016].  

Regarding the influence of chloride ion, both organic load and nitrogen removal rates increase 

with chloride ion concentration, although there is an optimum ratio between initial COD and 

chloride contents below which there is no further increase in the COD removal. The increase 

of current density has also a positive effect on the COD removal rate. The indirect oxidation 

through chlorine/hypochlorite is dominant on the electrooxidation process, being more 

relevant in leachate samples and for NH4
+ elimination. However, depending on the applied 

current density, an increase in the Cl- initial concentration may lead to higher [Cl-] in the final 

samples, without a significant increase in the COD and NH4
+ removal. 

The results obtained for L and S samples, regarding the removals of organic load and nitrogen, 

are not coincident, probably due to the different recalcitrance of both samples.

5. Conclusions 

 

The main goal of this thesis was to search for an efficient tin and antimony mixed oxide to be 

utilized as anode and to find suitable and low-cost electrochemical solutions for oxygen evolution 

and degradation of organic pollutants, and refractory wastewaters. The above presented results 

show that this objective was achieved. In the next paragraphs this subject will be discussed in 

more detail.  

  

Concluding remarks 

 

To attain the main objectives, secondary goals were established and experimental work was 

developed to achieve the proposed objectives. In the presentation of the experimental results 

the main conclusions were already drawn for each of the different studies performed. Based 

on those conclusions, an evaluation of the obtained results according to the proposed objectives 

is presented in this chapter.  

First objective: To prepare tin and antimony mixed oxides materials that are structural, 

chemical, mechanical and electrochemically stables. 

This goal was accomplished, and five different new materials were prepared by two different 

preparation methods. Two different Sn-Sb mixed oxides were prepared, over a Ti/Pt and Ti/Cu 

,substrate, by the alternate electrodeposition technique, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 and Ti/Cu/SnO2-

Sb2O3. To obtain thinner and uniform films, Sn-Sb oxide materials were prepared using the 

simultaneous deposition of the metals over several different substrates, namely Ti, Ti/Pt and 

Ti/Cu, to obtain the anodes Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb and Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb.  All the mixed oxides 

prepared were structural, morphological and electrochemically characterized by, respectively, 

XRD, SEM and CV.   

In the simultaneous electrodeposition only one oxide phase was identified, SnO2, being the 

antimony present in an intermetallic SbSn phase; in the alternate deposition, two oxide phases 

are obtained, SnO2 and Sb2O4 or Sb2O3.  

The introduction of a Pt or Cu interlayer increased surface’s roughness, particularly in the case 

of the Pt layer, being the highest relative roughness presented by Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. Apparently, 

relative roughness depends on the substrate morphology, as well as on the electrodeposition 

process and probably also on the film thickness. However, it is difficult to show a linear 

correlation between preparation method and roughness. 

 



70 

 

Second objective: To obtain tin and antimony mixed oxides materials with extended lifetime, 

suitable to be used in the degradation of organic pollutants or in the oxygen evolution reactions. 

This goal was accomplished. Regarding the lifetime of anodes, the electrodes with platinium 

interlayer have the best performance. The lifetime of the anodes prepared without interlayer 

is shorter when compared with that of Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. However the 

materials without a Pt interlayer are the best for direct oxidation of pollutants, as they present 

the largest potential window for oxygen evolution.  

From the prepared oxides, those with a copper interlayer presented the lowest potentials for 

oxygen evolution, being the most appropriate for oxygen production. On the other hand, they 

are less stable towards oxidative potentials, being unsuitable as anodes for the 

electrodegradation of organic pollutants. In fact, in the presence of sulfate, the copper layer 

oxidizes, resulting in the formation of copper sulfate.  

The roughness deeply influences the oxygen evolution reaction since for equal substrate and 

interlayer, the material with higher roughness factor (Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb prepared over a Pt 

interlayer) presents lower apparent activation energy, probably because the higher specific 

surface favors adsorption and facilitates the rate determining step. 

Third objective: To find correlations between the preparation method and the abilities of the 

prepared material for the different possible applications, namely degradation of organic 

pollutants or oxygen evolution reactions. 

Apparently, the correlation between the preparation method and the oxidizing abilities of the 

prepared material lies essentially on the existence or not of an interlayer and on the type of 

interlayer, since: 

– The inexistence of an interlayer between the titanium plate and the mixed oxide layer 
promotes the formation of a passivating TiO2 film that deeply reduces the lifetime of 

the electrode; 

– A copper interlayer is not appropriate for the utilization of the electrode at high 
potentials, since copper oxidizes and disables the electrode;  

– A platinum interlayer confers extended lifetime to the electrode, but reduces the 
electrodegradation rate of organic compounds, due to the platinum catalytic effect 

that promotes the reaction at the electrode’s surface, reducing the ability of the 

hydroxyl radicals for indirect oxidation.  

   

Fourth objective: To find, among all the prepared materials which is the most appropriate to 

be used as anode in the degradation of different types of pollutants. 



71 

 

From the discussion presented above, the most suitable materials to be used as anode in the 

degradation of organic pollutants are those with a platinum interlayer. In fact, although they 

have a more expensive preparation, due to the platinization, they present an outstanding 

service lifetime, with oxidation abilities similar to those presented by boron-doped diamond 

and lead oxide. Moreover, this electrode material, along with Ti/Pt/PbO2, presents higher 

ability for nitrogen elimination as gaseous forms and lower energy consumption than BDD, even 

in the treatment of sanitary landfill leachates and humic substances. 

 

 

Future trends 

 

Electrodes with platinium interlayer have proved to be electrochemical and mechanically 

stable. However, the introduction of a Pt layer increases their cost. Thus, to reduce the 

preparation costs, Pt must be substituted by a cheaper metal that also avoids the formation of 

an insulating TiO2 interlayer. Thus, other substrates, such as titanium nanotubes, carbon 

nanotubes, niobium, should be tested.
