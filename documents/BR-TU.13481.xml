ABSTRACT

A fish survey in 35 stream reaches (from 1st to 3rd order) with physicochemical and habitat assessment 
in the São José dos Dourados system, southeastern Brazil, was conducted. Most of the basin land cover 
(77.4%) is used for pasture. From the sampled stream reaches, 24 were of good physicochemical quality, 
10 of fair quality, and only one of poor quality. A habitat assessment showed that 10 stream reaches were 
considered fair, 22 were poor, and 3 were very poor. Fifty species were collected and their abundances 
showed strong correlation with habitat descriptors. In addition to the correlation between fish abundance 
and habitat, some species also showed optimal distribution related to the degree of physical habitat 
conservation. Streams located in this region experience organic pollution, but the most important aspect is 
the decline of the instream physical habitat condition, especially in first order streams, which negatively 
affects coarse substrates and water column dependent fish species. Effluent control, riparian vegetation 
restoration programs, siltation control and adequate sustainable soil use are practices which could mitigate 
such impacts.

Keywords: Upper Paraná, integrity, physicochemical, conservation, indices.

RESUMO

Ictiofauna de riachos, qualidade da água e do hábitat em uma bacia hidrográfica 
dominada por pastagens, Sudeste do Brasil

A ictiofauna de 35 trechos de riachos (de 1ª a 3ª ordem) no sistema do Rio São José dos Dourados, 
Sudeste do Brasil, foi estudada juntamente com a avaliação físico-química e física do hábitat. Na região 
estudada, 77,4% do solo é utilizado para pastagens. Quanto à avaliação físico-química da água, 24 trechos 
foram classificados como bons, 10 como regulares e um como pobre; quanto à avaliação física do hábitat, 
10 foram considerados regulares, 22 como pobres e 3 como muito pobres. Cinqüenta espécies foram 
coletadas e suas abundâncias apresentaram forte correlação com descritores do hábitat. Em adição a esta 
correlação, observou-se que algumas espécies também demonstraram sua distribuição ótima coincidente 
com o grau de conservação do hábitat físico. Os riachos dessa região estão expostos a impactos provenientes 
de poluição orgânica, mas especialmente pequenos riachos de primeira ordem estão seriamente afetados 
pela perda de qualidade física do hábitat, que, negativamente, afeta tanto espécies de peixes dependentes 
de substratos rochosos como espécies que exploram a coluna d’água. Controle da entrada de efluentes, 
programas adequados de restauração da vegetação ripária, controle do aporte de sedimento e uso adequado 
e sustentável do solo são práticas que podem mitigar tais impactos.

Palavras-chave: Alto Paraná, integridade, físico-químico, conservação, índices.

INTRODUCTION

An effective assessment of lotic condition 
requires comprehending the multiple causes of 
stress on the aquatic biota, including habitat loss 
and degradation, the spread of non-native species, 
overexploitation, secondary extinctions, chemical 
and organic pollution, and global climate change 
(Allan &amp;amp; Flecker, 1993). The accuracy in detecting 
such impacts is clearly limited, but the search for 
adequate indicators at several levels (i.e. chemical, 
physical, and biological) has been carried out for 
nearly a century (e.g., Forbes &amp;amp; Richardson, 1919). 
Dams and anthropogenic deforestation at levels 
ranging from massive projects to local cumulative 
alterations are important forces worldwide that are 
modifying both landscapes and waterways (Allan 
&amp;amp; Flecker, 1993).

With the exception of some remote Amazonian 
rivers, most aquatic environments have been altered 
by human activities in Brazil (Tundisi &amp;amp; Barbosa, 
1995), including wetland drainage, dams, road 
building, and deforestation for human settlements 
and intensive agriculture. All of these modifications 
had a negative impact on the hydrology, vegetation 
cover, and terrestrial-aquatic linkages (Allan &amp;amp; 
Flecker, 1993) of the affected systems. A prime 
example is the State of São Paulo, the most 
industrialized and populous in Brazil that retains 
only 14% of its original vegetation (Zorzetto et al., 
2003), which originally was represented primarily 
by Semi-Deciduous forests, Atlantic rainforests, and 
Savannah (Cerrado). These last two biomes were 
considered biodiversity hotspots for conservation 
priorities by Myers et al. (2000). Semi-Deciduous 
forests, which were previously the main vegetation 
coverage of the western portion of the State are now 
restricted to small, unconnected, residual fragments. 
This region is drained by the lower rio Tietê, the rio 
São José dos Dourados, and the rio Turvo, and few 
studies reported stream fish assemblages in these 
river basins (Garutti, 1988; Lemes &amp;amp; Garutti, 2002; 
Castro et al., 2004). We surveyed the São José 
dos Dourados system as part of a project aiming 
to develop a fish index of biotic integrity for the 
upper rio Paraná headwaters and streams. The most 
important step in the IBI development is to choose 
and integrate metrics that reflect diverse responses 
of biological systems to human actions (Karr &amp;amp; 
Chu, 1999). Because ecology and biology of stream 
fish in that region are poorly known, in this study 

we investigated fish assemblage structures in a wide 
range of physicochemical and habitat conditions, 
in randomly selected places in order to detect the 
main kinds of impacts on the fish fauna.

STUDY AREA AND REGIONAL 
REFERENCE AREA

The São José dos Dourados system includes 
the river basin plus some small tributaries of 
the left margin of the rio Paraná. The system is 
located in the Serra Geral formation, composed of 
basaltic and sedimentary rocks of the Cauiá and 
Bauru groups. The sandy Botucatu and Pirambóia 
formations (both belonging to the São Bento 
group) are the aquifers of the region (IPT, 2000). 
The climate is hot tropical (Nimer, 1989), with a 
wet season from October to March (January and 
February are the wettest months, with 54% of the 
annual rainfall), and a dry season, extending from 
April to September (Barcha &amp;amp; Arid, 1971). The 
maximum mean temperature (31 °C) occurs in 
January, and the minimum average (13 °C) occurs 
in July (IPT, 2000).

We adopted the regional reference concept to 
calibrate physicochemical and habitat descriptors, 
a more adequate design when monitoring is 
applied to a watershed or river basin (Barbour 
et al., 1999). The most important reference area 
was the quasi pristine Morro do Diabo State Park 
(22° 27’ to 22° 40’ S, 52° 10’ to 52° 22’ W), that 
encompasses approximately 33,000 ha, in the 
municipality of Teodoro Sampaio, Pontal do 
Paranapanema region, southwestern São Paulo 
state. Four streams within the park were previously 
studied by Casatti et al. (2001) and Casatti (2002, 
2004). The park’s monthly rainfall varied from 
14.7 mm (May 2000) to 361 mm (December 2000) 
and temperatures ranged from - 1.2 °C (July 2000) 
to 37.8 °C (October 2000) (data from the weather 
station in the park). Physicochemical unpublished 
data recorded in the Morro do Diabo State Park 
streams were also provided by Daniela M. L. da 
Silva. Additional reference areas included also 
relatively less impacted streams studied in the upper 
Rio Paraná basin by Castro et al. (2003, 2004).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Thirty-five sites of first to third order 
(according to Strahler, 1957, map scale 1:50,000) 



683STREAM FISH AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

were selected using a random approach (Kasyak, 
2001). The number of sites was approximately 
proportional to the total length in km for a 
particular stream order (Roth et al., 1997). One 
site was selected for each 100 km of length order, 
for a total of 22 first order, nine second order, and 
four third order sites. Following Kasyak (2001), a 
75 m stream reach was chosen at each site with the 
aim of including all available macrohabitats. All 
stream reaches were sampled during the beginning 
of a single dry season (March to June, 2003) to 
minimize seasonal effects.

Land cover
The land cover map of the São José dos 

Dourados River system was developed by digitally 
supervised classification of two TM/Landsat-
5 images (path-row: 222/74 and 221/74 already 
georeferenced), using the maximum likelihood 
method (Eastman, 2001; Lillesand &amp;amp; Kieffer, 
2000). The images of the study area (August 1996) 
were acquired from the Instituto Nacional de 
Pesquisas Espaciais (Brazil). Bands 3, 4, and 5 were 
digitally processed to produce a land cover map 
with the following categories: pasture, perennial 
crops, remaining natural vegetation, sugar-cane, 
reforestation, water-bodies, annual crops, bare soil, 
urban locations, and others. Training sites were 
identified using field observations and internet data 
(www.cati.sp.gov.br) and the classification accuracy 
was checked using a field survey. Sixty randomly 
selected points were visited, and the Kappa Index 
of Agreement (Eastman, 2001) was 0.88, where 
90% of the points had corresponding land use.

Fish
Fish were collected during two electrofishing 

passes (modified from Mazzoni et al., 2000; 
Castro et al., 2003), fixed in 10% formalin and 
later transferred to 70% ethanol. All specimens 
were deposited in the ichthyological collection 
of the Departamento de Zoologia e Botânica da 
Universidade Estadual Paulista, São José do Rio 
Preto, Brazil (DZSJRP 5833 to 6190).

Water and habitat quality
The combination of water quality and physical 

description can provide insight to the presence of 
chemical and non-chemical stressors to the stream 
ecosystem and for this reason we analyzed both 

components in separate ways, always comparing 
them to regional reference conditions (Barbour 
et al., 1999). In a broad sense, habitat incorporates 
all aspects of physical and chemical constituents 
along with the biotic factors, but following Barbour 
et al. (1999), we consider habitat as the instream 
and riparian zone that influences the structure and 
function of the ichthyocenosis. 

A water quality index for small streams 
(Stream Water Index, SWI) of the upper Rio 
Paraná basin is herein proposed and includes 
physicochemical descriptors usually linked to fish 
health, specifically dissolved oxygen, conductivity, 
pH, turbidity (all measured through digital meter 
Horiba®, model U-10), orthophosphate, nitrate, 
and ammonia (all analyzed in laboratory). In 
addition, water odors and water surface oils were 
also registered (Barbour et al., 1999) as indicators 
of possible human disturbance of a stream reach. 
Scores 4 to 1 were determined based on their 
deviation from the reference conditions and the 
average final score for each site was classified in 
four categories (Table 1).

For the physical assessment of the habitat, 
a visual-based habitat approach was conducted. 
Many protocols are applied around the world, all 
of them including descriptors which describe the 
stream micro/macro features, riparian condition, 
and bank structure (Barbour et al., 1999). We 
combined the protocols proposed by Roth et al. 
(1996), Barbour et al. (1999), and Kasyak (2001). 
Scores were established a priori according to 
reference conditions, usually separating sites 
into high-gradient and low-gradient reaches. To 
minimize subjectivity, the same person evaluated 
all sites. All descriptors were evaluated and rated 
on a numerical scale of 0 to 20 for each sampling 
reach (see Habitat Form on Appendix). The sum 
of all scores represented four habitat integrity 
categories (Table 2) of the Physical Habitat Index 
(PHI). Habitat descriptors are:

1. Substrate stability. This includes the degree 
of cover provided by natural structures in 
each stream, such as cobble (in riffles), large 
rocks, fallen trees, logs and branches that are 
available as shelter, feeding, or spawning 
and nursery sites. Decreases in the variety 
and abundance of such structures render 
the habitat more homogeneous, thereby 
decreasing habitat diversity and recovery 



684 CASATTI, L. et al.

potential. Logs and branches in low gradient 
streams are often critical habitats for such 
purposes (Barbour et al., 1999);

2. Velocity and depth variability. The different 
combinations of velocity and depth represent 
another component of habitat diversity. High 
gradient streams often show four patterns 
of flow: slow/deep, slow/shallow, fast/deep, 
fast/shallow. Low gradient streams show 
four patterns of pools: large/shallow, large/
deep, small/shallow, small/deep (Barbour 
et al., 1999; Kasyak, 2001);

3. Flow stability. This represents the occurrence 
of natural and continuous flows versus 
flashy or ephemeral flow (Roth et al., 1996), 
such as typically found in areas with dams, 

obstructions, diversions for irrigation or 
during droughts;

4. Bottom deposition. Fine sediments accumu-
late mainly in pools, but may also embed 
in riffles, or create islands, point bars, or 
embayments. Depending on the channel 
slope, an increase in fine sediment indicates 
a less suitable environment for aquatic biota 
(Barbour et al., 1999); however, islands, 
point bars, and embayments increase channel 
complexity;

5. Combinations of pool-riffles-runs. This 
describes the variety of macrohabitats 
present; i.e. the combinations between 
pools, riffles, runs, and small marginal pools, 
against the predominance of channelized 
reaches (Roth et al., 1996);

aspects of physical condition not resembling those of minimally disturbed 
streams, indicating some degradation (50-25% of the reference).

streams, indicating severe degradation (below 25% of the reference).

6. Channel alteration. Measures large-scale 
changes in the shape of the stream channel 
such as artificial embankments, artificial 
bank stabilization, channelization, and 
dredging (Barbour et al., 1999);

7. Streamside cover. Riparian zones are areas 
along water bodies, often with flood tolerant 
plants. When these zones support complex 
woody vegetation, they play a vital role in 
the structure and maintenance of physical 
habitat, energy flow, and aquatic assemblage 
composition. Riparian vegetation buffers 
against siltation, and elevated pollutants and 
water temperature, while providing habitat, 
nutrient input, and shelter and substrate 
for microorganisms (Millard et al., 1999; 
Barbour et al., 1999). The limits of the 
riparian zone are not easily defined and may 
vary with the season (Lima &amp;amp; Zakia, 2000). 
There is no definitive method to establish 
the minimal riparian width for satisfactorily 
protecting water courses (Bren, 1993). For 
temperate streams in Ontario, Canada, 
Barton et al. (1985) defined a minimum 
buffer zone of 18 m from each bank. In 
Australia, Clinnick (1985) recommended 
30 m. For Maryland streams, Kasyak (2001) 
proposed at least 50 m, but FEMAT (1993) 
proposed a 70 m minimum buffer zone in 
the northwest USA. Brazilian legislation 
requires a minimum of 30 m of riparian 
vegetation for water bodies 10 m wide. In the 
absence of scientific consensus concerning 
the ideal riparian width, we used the 
minimal limits required by Brazilian laws. 
The mere presence of riparian vegetation is 
not indicative of natural conditions, since the 
presence of non-native species (Roth et al., 
2001) and the absence of larger trees indicate 
a decline of integrity. This metric was 
consequently scored considering both the 
width and integrity of riparian vegetation;

8. Bank vegetative stability. Measures the 
extent of the streambank surface covered 
with vegetation or rubble, both of which 
provide protection from erosion (Roth et al., 
1996; Barbour et al., 1999); and

9. Bank stability. This metric verifies whether 
stream banks are eroded, thereby including 
their potential for erosion. Higher potential 

for erosion is found in steeper and therefore 
more unstable banks. Erosion signs include 
crumbling, unforested banks, exposed roots 
and exposed soil. Each bank is evaluated 
separately (Barbour et al., 1999; Kasyak, 
2001).

Data analysis
In order to ordinate the information about 

species abundance along sites, a detrended 
correspondence analysis (DCA) was conducted, 
using the option of 26 segments in the PCOrd 
software (McCune &amp;amp; Mefford, 1999). Following 
Cao et al. (1998) rare species were not excluded 
from ordination because of the importance of 
this class of species in bioassessment. The mean 
velocity, mean depth, amount of riparian coverage 
(absent, present, or abundant), amount of marginal 
vegetation in contact with water (absent, present, 
or abundant), and predominant substrate (sand, 
sand/gravel, or sand/gravel/woody debris) were 
correlated with an ichthyocenosis structure using 
the Mantel test and Euclidean Distance for the 
abiotic matrix and Morisita-Horn for the species 
matrix; comparisons were made with the option 
of normalization and 5,000 permutations in the 
NTSYSpc software (Rohlf, 2000).

RESULTS

The São José dos Dourados system covers 
6,793 km2, most of which (77.4%) is pasture. 
The original vegetation, mostly represented by 
Semi-Deciduous forests, is found in only 5.6% of 
the system (Table 3), and is represented by very 
degraded, small, and unconnected fragments.

Among the 35 stream reaches sampled, 
24 had good SWI, 10 had fair, and only one had 
poor water quality (Fig. 1a). Expressive differences 
were not registered stream among orders (mean 
SWI for first order = 32.8, second order = 31.0, 
third order = 32.5). The physical habitat assessment 
(Fig. 1b) suggests greater disturbance in the structure 
of the habitat than the physicochemical conditions 
of the water. Ten stream reaches had regular PHI 
(mean score = 98.3), 22 were considered poor 
(mean score = 69.4), and 3 had very poor habitats 
(score = 28.3). The lowest PHI scores were 
registered for streamside cover, bank stability, bank 
vegetative stability, and bottom deposition, in that

order. First order streams showed the lowest PHI 
scores (mean = 66.4) in comparison to the second 
(mean = 86.7) and third order streams (mean = 
88.5). SWI and PHI were not significantly correlated 
(Spearman coefficient = - 0.1923, p = 0.2685).

Fifty species of fish, belonging to six orders 
and 18 families (Table 4) were collected, for a 
total of 7,324 specimens and 19.7 kg. Astyanax 
altiparanae was the most abundant species 
(26% of the total abundance), followed by Poecilia 
reticulata (18%), and Knodus moenkhausii (12%). 
In terms of biomass, Astyanax altiparanae, Hoplias 
malabaricus, and Gymnotus carapo were the most 
important species. Poecilia reticulata, Oreochromis 
niloticus, and Tilapia rendalii are introductions 
from outside the upper Rio Paraná system in the 
first case and outside South America in the two last 
cases. Knodus moenkhausii, Laetacara sp., and 
Satanoperca pappaterra represent species whose 
origin is not clearly defined in the upper rio Paraná 
basin. The mean richness increased according to 
stream order (5 for first order, 7 for second order, 
and 12 for third order). Higher abundance and 
biomass were registered in stream 34, a second 
order stretch, whereas lowest abundance and 
biomass were obtained in stream 12, a first order 
stretch (Table 5).

Mantel statistics showed that species 
abundance and habitat descriptors were correlated 
(r = - 0.26024, p = 0.0012, ? = 0.01) and DCA 
analysis indicated that species gradient is, in 
general, compatible with physical habitat conditions 
(Fig. 2). Sites 5, 6, 7, 11, 16, 17, 18, 27, 31, and 
34, all with the best PHI values, were placed in 
close ecological proximity. Some species reflect 
such ordination (Fig. 3) and thus can potentially 
indicate habitat conservation (i.e., Bryconamericus 
stramineus, Characidium zebra, Hypostomus 
sp., Imparfinis schubarti, Moenkhausia 
sanctaefilomenae, Pamphorichthys hollandi, 
Piabina argentea, Pimelodella avanhandavae, 
Pseudopimelodus pulcher, and Steindachnerina 
insculpta). In contrast, in the opposite ordination 
gradient (Fig. 2), sites 19, 30, and 32 showed the 
lowest values for PHI. Similarly, species whose 
optimum reflects this ordination (Fig. 3) could 
reveal signals of habitat degradation (i.e., Aspidoras 
fuscoguttatus, Callichthys callichthys, Cichlasoma 
paranaense, Geophagus brasiliensis, Gymnotus 
carapo, Knodus moenkhausii, Laetacara sp., 

Oreochromis niloticus, Pyrrhulina australis, 
Poecilia reticulata, Rivulus pictus, Satanoperca 
pappaterra, and Tilapia rendalli).

DISCUSSION

Environmental conditions
Streams located in the northeastern region of 

São Paulo State are subject to two major classes 
of environmental impacts which could negatively 
affect fish biotic integrity. One of them is organic 
pollution derived from domestic sewage. Despite 
the fact that a high percentage (97%) of sampled 
streams demonstrated a water condition which was 
theoretically adequate for fish assemblages, at least 
three other streams in the basin (not selected in our 
analysis) received untreated sewage (IPT, 2000), 
and we believe that this number could be higher and 
this source of impact must be evaluated at the basin 
scale. Rapid population growth after 1970 intensified 
problems associated with urbanization. In 1970, 
the São José dos Dourados system had 194,000 
inhabitants, and by 2010 it is expected to have 
213,000, corresponding to 0.52% of the total 
population expected for São Paulo State (IPT, 
2000). Despite its low population densities when 
compared to the rest of the State, only 12% of the 
municipalities in the basin had any kind of municipal 
planning (IPT, 2000). Continuous uncontrolled 
human growth rates combined with little attention 
paid to aquatic resources suggest a future decrease 
in the stream water quality within the basin.

The agency responsible for monitoring surface 
water chemical quality in São Paulo State traditionally 
uses a water quality index (WQI), developed by the 
National Sanitation Foundation, that employs nine 
parameters which are combined to classify water 
for human usage (Braga et al., 2002). Despite being 
500 km long, in the São José dos Dourados river, the 
WQI is currently calculated for only one site in the 
main course of the river (Braga et al., 2002), which 
is clearly insufficient to assess water quality of the 
entire basin. Seasonal water quality changes were 
not tested in our study, but in two agricultural streams 
in a close region, the WQI showed better conditions 
in the winter than in the summer (Carvalho et al., 
2000). The authors attributed these differences to 
the increased water temperature, turbidity, pH, and 
fecal bacteria load resulting from land degradation

in the availability of sites for feeding, shelter, and 
reproduction. Ninety-four percent of the sites had 
poor or very poor physical habitats for supporting 
fish assemblages, which means substantial 
deviation from regional reference conditions and 
indicates high levels of degradation. Furthermore, 
we observed that many small first order streams 

listed in our 1970 map database are dry and 
completely silted.

The lowest PHI scores were obtained

replacement of the original forests by pasture 
in more than 77% of the region is critical and

the State of São Paulo, since about 12% of the 
forested area has been logged during the last ten 
years (Zorzetto et al., 2003). Deforestation of 

riparian buffers follows agriculturalization, often 
without environmental planning or conservation 
(Rodrigues &amp;amp; Gandolfi, 2000), increasing thermal

and nutrient sediment inputs into water courses 
(Rabeni &amp;amp; Smale, 1995). Wichert &amp;amp; Rapport 
(1998), assessing agricultural watersheds, 
suggested that enhancement of stream habitat 
for fish may be achieved by rehabilitating the 
riparian vegetation. Nonetheless, rehabilitation of 
riparian areas must be prioritized and intensified 
in headwaters because the negative impacts of 
deforestation are more significant in these small 
water bodies (Gregory et al., 1991), extending 
along downstream sites (Dale Jones et al., 1999).

Fish fauna
We evaluated small streams ranging from 

the first to third order. The mean species number 
increased according to the stream order, reflecting 
the predictive power of this descriptor in richness 
(Matthews, 1998). Along a stream-order, gradient 
changes in habitat features may reflect species 
addition, species replacement or changing relative 
abundances (Gorman &amp;amp; Karr, 1978). In fact, streams 
belonging to similar orders have similar physical 
attributes influenced by peculiar combinations of 
current, discharge, depth, and substrate, which 
select for fish species adapted to local features 
(Matthews, 1998), but in some cases discharge 
can be a better predictor concerning richness, 
abundance, and biomass than order (Hughes &amp;amp; 
Omernik, 1983). In some cases there is not a unique 
descriptor that can satisfactorily predict richness 
because of the sinergistic combination among many 
of them. In site 34, a second order stretch, we found 
the highest richness, abundance, and biomass. This 
site presents high macrohabitat diversity, regular 
habitat integrity, absence of riparian vegetation, and 
also a relative amount of debris from aviculture. 
The two last features may sinergistically increase 
in situ primary production, and consequently the 
secondary production. However, this condition 
may be transitory because the absence of riparian 
vegetation facilitates sediment intake with further 
embeddedness of specific microhabitats, thereby 
further affecting fish assemblage integrity.

Fish abundance correlates with habitat, as 
indicated by results of the Mantel test. A similar 
association was also found by Wilkinson &amp;amp; Edds 
(2001) in temperate streams and was considered 
consistent with the hypothesis that community 
organization depends on environmental factors at 
the basin-wide scale. We have observed not only 

correlations between fish abundance and habitat, 
but also noted that some species have their optimal 
distribution coincident with the degree of habitat 
conservation (see Fig. 3) or specific impacts. The 
land is mainly used for pasture, which means low 
inputs of nutrients when compared to sewage, and 
probably also herbicides and pesticides pollution 
when compared to crops. Thus, the main threat 
for streams in the region is the physical habitat 
degradation, mostly substrate simplification and 
water column reduction, both consequences of 
the excessive sedimentation or siltation. In spite 
of being a natural process, siltation is difficult to 
document, but probably the process has been greatly 
increased in the studied region since the early 
last century, after the initial deforestation mainly 
for coffee plantation (Monbeig, 1998). Either 
in temperate regions and tropics, high sediment 
loading is considered the major problem affecting 
the quality of continental waters and aquatic biota 
(Lemly, 1982; Dudgeon, 2000).

As examples of fish species particularly 
associated with good physical habitat conditions, 
Bryconamericus stramineus and Moenkhausia 
sanctaefilomenae are considered good water 
column swimmers (Casatti &amp;amp; Castro, 1998; 
Casatti, 2002), depending on adequate habitat 
volume which decreases with severe siltation. 
Characidium zebra, Hypostomus sp., Imparfinis 
schubarti, and Pseudopimelodus pulcher have 
reophilic preferences (Castro &amp;amp; Casatti, 1997; 
personal observations) and must also be negatively 
affected with siltation due to the embeddedness of 
the rocky substrate. The toothless Steindachnerina 
insculpta probably requires special soft substrates 
to ileophagy (see Fugi et al., 1996 for feeding data) 
being also negatively affected with siltation.

Through substrate changes, siltation could 
benefit some species; specifically those adapted 
to sandy bottoms, as in the case of Knodus 
moenkhausii, a feeding generalist species (M. 
Ceneviva-Bastos, personal communication). 
Reduction of the water column caused by siltation 
negatively affects water oxygenation and only 
species with behavioral or physiological strategies 
can support these changes. In a very silted stream 
(site 32) Poecilia reticulata represented 62% of 
the fish abundance. This species is considered as 
having expressive phenotipic plasticity (Trexler, 
1988), including swimming strategies for

living in hypoxic waters (Kramer &amp;amp; Mehegan, 
1981). Laetacara sp., Satanoperca pappaterra, 
Cichlasoma paranaense, and Geophagus 
brasiliensis, despite presenting distinct feeding 
tactics, all feed on soft bottoms (Sabino &amp;amp; Castro, 
1990; Casatti et al., 2003; personal observations), 
largely available in silted streams. In addition, 
Laetacara sp. was often observed in hypoxic waters 
(about 1 mg/l). Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia 
rendalli are species introduced in many aquatic 
systems worldwide, and the hypoxia tolerance 
for the first species was documented by Chapman 
et al. (1995). Native species like Aspidoras 
fuscoguttatus, Callichthys callichthys, Pyrrhulina 
australis, Rivulus pictus, and Gymnotus carapo 
were found in low oxygen waters (Araújo &amp;amp; 
Garutti, 2003; Mol, 1994; Shibatta &amp;amp; Bennemann, 
2003; personal observations), a condition often 
found in shallow silted streams. Thus, ecology 
of these species and their responses to a range of 
human interference could reveal reliable metrics 
for the regional IBI.

The validity of assemblage structure 
descriptors in the evaluation of the biotic integrity 
has been discussed by some authors (Fausch 
et al., 1990). Despite showing indications of 
disturbance, such methods are strongly influenced 
by sample size (Fausch et al., 1990). The great 
challenge in stream biological monitoring is to 
find, define, measure, and test metrics which can 
integrate elements and biological processes at 
several organization levels and reflect the antropic 
influence on such communities (Karr, 1999). As 
we demonstrated in this study, routine ecological 
analysis and ordination techniques, together with 
natural history and biogeographical knowledge, 
can give meaningful signals when searching for 
good biological attributes.

Measurements of physicochemical or habitat 
conditions cannot replace biological assessments 
and do not capture all the ways humans influence 
water resources (Karr &amp;amp; Chu, 1999). Fish require 
more than only good chemical or physical 
conditions to thrive, and such restrict assessments 
are insufficient to evaluate biological integrity. Our 
survey is the first attempt to produce a method 
to assess stream habitat for the region and an 
alert to resource managers and society about the 
anthropogenic threats to surface water resources 
in the São José dos Dourados system. Based on 

our cursory analysis in this pasture dominated 
landscape, mitigation efforts should be centered 
on reversing the degradation in the physical quality 
of the streams, specifically those of the first order, 
minimizing physical habitat losses of aquatic biota 
by rehabilitating riparian vegetation, controlling 
siltation, and conserving soil. Specifically in the 
case of riparian zones restoration, this could be an 
important opportunity for improving connectivity 
between terrestrial habitats (Becker et al., 2004). 
In addition, effluents should be treated and land use 
controls must be developed for, at least, the most 
populous municipalities in the system. The next 
steps of this study will include tests on biological 
attributes in order to develop a fish biotic integrity 
index. Thus, we expect to obtain a more complete 
scenario regarding the multiple sources of threats 
to the streams in this region.
