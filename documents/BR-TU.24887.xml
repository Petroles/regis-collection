RESUMO 
 
As tecnicas convencionais para o controlo da salinidade do solo, nomeadamente a 
lixiviação do solo e o aumento da fertilização, são métodos usados para diminuir a 
salinidade do solo e  aumentar a tolerância das culturas que se desenvolvem em solos 
salinos. Contudo, o uso intensivo destas tecnicas tem chamado a atenção pública para o 
problema da contaminação ambiental devido à salinização de camadas mais profundas do 
solo e dos aquíferos. Recentemente surgiu uma nova tecnica limpa e amientalmente útil, em 
que espécies removedoras de sal (iões) são plantadas ou semeadas nos solos salinos e têm 
sido utilizadas para remover o sal dos solos. A capacidade de remoção de sal de Portulaca 
oleracea Golden Purslane e sete plantas natives locais - Tamarix hispida, Apocynum 
lancifolium, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Portulaca oleracea Green Purslane, Alhagi pseudalhagi, 
Karelinia caspia, e Chenopodium album foram testadas neste estudo. Os ensaios de campo 
foram efectuados na região Khoresm, no norte do Uzbequistão, durante o Verão, o período 
mais sensível para os solos salinos. . A Portulaca oleracea golden purslane foi semeada em 
dois solos salinos diferentes, um deles regado e o outro de sequeiro. A colheita foi realizada 
duas vezes, ao longo da fase de crescimento e na da fase de frutificação da . Portulaca 
oleracea golden purslane. Os resultados mostraram que a  cultura de sequeiro removeu uma 
quantidade mais alta de sais e a sua produção foi superior. Isto deve-se à ascensão da água 
capilar, que resultou numa contribuição significativa para as necessidades hídricas das 
plantas, aumentando a sua transpiração. A maxima remoção de sal variou de 496.6 a 511.3 
kg ha-1 na fase de crescimento e na fase de frutificação da Portulaca oleracea, que 
eventualmente removeu cerca de 16.8 % do total de sais no solo, a 10 cm de profundidade. 
A mais eficiente planta nativa na remoção de sal foi a C.album. Esta planta removeu 538.4 
a 596.6 kg ha-1 na fase de crescimento e na fase de frutificação, a uma profundidade de 25 
cm, respectivamente, Este estudo mostrou que a Portulaca oleracea golden purslane (maior 
quantdade de sais) e a Chenpodium album (extracção mais profunda de sais) podem vir a 
ser potenciais espécies usadas para controlar e combater a salinidade nas regiões do norte 
do Uzbequistão e poderão também vir a ser integradas nos programas de cultivo e de 
rotação na para a remediação dos solos salinos.

ABSTRACT 

Conventional techniques, namely soil leaching and the use of enhancing fertilization are 
methods used to mitigate soil salinity and to increase the salt tolerance of agricultural crops 
grown in salt-affected soils. However, the intensive use of these techniques has also 
attracted public attention due to the environmental pollution caused and the contamination 
of groundwater resources. Recently, a new environmentally safe and clean remediation 
technique, whereby salt (ion) removing species are planted in the salt-affected soils, has 
been introduced to address salinity problems. The salt removal potential of Portulaca 
oleracea Golden Purslane and seven native naturally grown wild plants - Tamarix hispida, 
Apocynum lancifolium, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Portulaca oleracea Green Purslane, Alhagi 
pseudalhagi, Karelinia caspia, and Chenopodium album have been evaluated under this 
study. The field experiments were carried out in the Khorezm Region, in the northwest of 
Uzbekistan, during the summer, the most sensitive period for salt-affected soils. Portulaca 
oleracea golden purslane was planted in two different salt-affected soils, one field with 
irrigation and one without irrigation. The harvest was twice, in the developing and seedling 
stages of Portulaca oleracea golden purslane. The results have revealed that no irrigation 
was required to remove the highest soil salts and to obtain the highest biomass in Portulaca 
oleracea golden purslane. The capillary rise from groundwater played a significant role in 
meeting the demand of plants for water, increasing plant transpiration. The highest salt 
accumulation varied from 496.6 up to 511.3 kg ha-1 in the developing and seedling phases 
of Portulaca oleracea, which eventually, removed about 16.8 % of the total soil salts, at a 
depth of 10 cm. The most efficient wild plant in removing salts from the soil was C.album.  
This plant removed 538.4 up to 596.6 kg ha-1 at a depth of 25 cm, in the developing and 
seedling stages, respectively. The study indicated that Portulaca oleracea golden purslane 
(higher amount of salts) and Chenopodium album (deeper salts extraction) could become 
potential species used to control and to combat salinity in the northern part of Uzbekistan 
and could also be integrated into cultivation/rotation programmes to remediate saline soils. 
 
 
 
 
 
Keywords: Soil salination, phytoremediation, salt removing species, conventional 
techniques, clean techniques.

I - INTRODUCTION 

Salinity stress is a key factor that limits crop production world-wide and is a constraint to 

economic development and to the environment. The economic impacts resulting from 

salinity are mainly associated with a decrease in the production capacity of land. The 

negative environmental impacts are most often the degradation of land, namely soil 

salination and groundwater contamination. 

Soil salination is a major threat to the environment and is especially problematic where 

human interventions have disturbed natural ecosystems. Anthropogenic activities have 

increased soil salinity by changing the natural balance of the water cycle, by allowing 

excess recharging of groundwater and salt accumulation through its concentration (Justin 

Murphy, 1999). Moreover, groundwater contamination is also an important negative 

environmental impact, which is intensified by seawater intrusion in coastal zones (Ben 

Asher et al., 2002).  

With a land mass covering 447,400 square kilometer, Uzbekistan is one of the countries in 

Central Asia most heavily reliant on irrigated agriculture. The contribution of agriculture to 

the national economy is 24.1% of Gross National Product (GNP), 60% of foreign currency 

income, and 45% of employment (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2003). The total land area of 

Uzbekistan amounts to 44.7 million hectares of which 4.3 million hectares are potentially 

suitable for irrigation (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2003). Almost 85% of Uzbekistan’s territory 

is covered by desert or semi-desert, including the largest desert in Central Asia, the 

“The ground – is not only a huge property, but it is also a  
  key factor of which this country depends”.

Introduction 

 2

Kyzylkum Desert. The most serious threat to agricultural production and ecosystem safety 

in the north of Uzbekistan is high salt accumulation and secondary salinization of irrigated 

soil. This has mostly resulted due to the mis-management of water and land resources over 

the last forty years (Szabolcs, 1989). More than half of the 2.32 million hectares of irrigated 

land in Uzbekistan is salt-affected and the build-up salinity is seriously threatening 

agricultural productivity (ICARDA, 2002). Every year, 75 million tons of salt is spreading 

with a 1000 km radius and into other Central Asian countries (Shadimetov, 2006). The 

main causes for this are identified as the shrinking of the Aral Sea, seawater intrusion 

towards the land, long-term irrigation, inappropriate drainage systems and global climate 

changes. 

Before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Uzbekistan was a major producer of 

cotton, which is one of the most salt-tolerant crops. In order to obtain an increasing amount 

of cotton, the country was using enormous amounts of water resources from the two main 

rivers – the Amudarya and the Syrdarya. These rivers supply the Aral Sea. Furthermore, 

farmers have been pursuing extensive agricultural development through the use of high 

levels of fertilizers and pesticides in order to increase crop productivity. The consequences 

of using enormous amounts of water resources and heavy application of chemicals has 

resulted in rising groundwater tables, salinization and the well-known ecological disaster 

around the Aral Sea (Toderich et al., 2002). Moreover, low irrigation efficiencies – caused 

by unlined canals and a poor drainage networks – has led to major waterlogging and 

salinization that has now affected about 55 percent of irrigated land in the country (FAO, 

1998).  



Introduction 

 3

Due to long-term irrigation and poor drainage systems, the salinity of irrigated areas in the 

northern part of Uzbekistan has amounted to 100 percent in the Khorezm region and to 94.3 

percent in Karakalpakstan region (Uzgipromeliovodhoz, 2002).  

The Khorezm region has been selected as the focus of this thesis study as it is one of the 

areas in Central Asia most strongly affected by secondary soil salinization. In this region, 

the dominant approaches adopted by farmers to mitigate salinity is to apply excessive 

amounts of water to salt-affected fields in order to leach the salts into the root zone 

allowing infiltration of salts to deeper layers. This approach has two potential outcomes – 

firstly, when there is an impermeable layer, salts are accumulated above this layer and 

secondly, when there is no impermeable layer, groundwater contamination can be observed 

(Ayers and Westcot, 1985; Ben Mechlia, 2002). When soils become highly saline, farmers 

tend to abandon the salt-affected fields resulting in large tracks of saline/waterlogged soils 

(Kushiev et al., 2005). 

An alternative approach used in the region to combat salinity and to maximize agricultural 

crop production is the heavy application of fertilizers; in this case the tolerance of plants to 

saline conditions is increased, but contamination by hazardous chemicals will also be 

increased due to the higher amount of fertilizers applied (Beltrao et al., 2002).  

It was reported by World Bank that annually significant irrigated land is taken out of crop 

production due to salinization. The rehabilitation of these salinised areas requires major 

technical expertise and financial investment. The rehabilitation cost has been assessed by 

the World Bank to be more than USD $ 3 billion (World Bank, 2003).   

In recent years, a new environmentally safe and clean technique known as 

phytoremediation has been introduced to address the salinity problem. This includes the 

introduction of salt (ion) removing species to control salinity and to maintain the 



Introduction 

 4

sustainability of landscapes and agricultural fields (Cuartero et al., 2002; Shaaban &amp;amp; El 

Fourly, 2002).  Phytoremediation is defined as the use of plants to remove pollutants from 

the environment and to render them harmless (Salt et al., 1998). Large-scale 

decontamination of soils and underground water using phytoremediation techniques 

requires plants with high salt uptake rates, large biomass and tolerance to a wide array of 

environmental conditions and constraints. Moreover, the creation of highly productive 

fodder systems1 through the establishment of palatable halophytes2 has been shown to 

remediate saline/sodic soils3 as well as provide an income resource to poor farmers (Hyder, 

1981; Helalia et al., 1992; Dagar et al., 2004). 

The best way to select salt removing species is to assess native naturally grown halophytic 

species since the salt tolerance of a plant relates to its resistance and ability to grow under 

conditions of high winds, salt spray, alkaline soils and infertile sandy soils. In addition, the 

use of halophytes has great potential for landscaping and building greenification4 in high 

saline areas. 

The main aim of this work is to develop recommendations for soil remediation for the 

northern region of Uzbekistan and to rehabilitate salt-affected soils using phytoremediation 

techniques. The specific research objectives are as follows: 

• to evaluate Portulaca oleracea golden purslane in the salt-affected soils of northern 

Uzbekistan for its ability to remove salts; 

                                                 
1 Any plants and crops that is used specifically to feed livestock, such as cattle, sheep, horses and chickens 
2 Salt tolerant species that have a good enough taste to be eaten or drunk 
3 A nonsaline soil containing sufficient exchangeable sodium (Na+) to adversely affect crop production and 
soil structure under most conditions of soil and plant type. The sodium adsorption ratio of the saturation 
extract (SARe) is at least 13 
4 Beautify and sustain the nature with plants 



Introduction 

 5

• to identify the most suitable native plants for removing salts from the soil based on the 

morphological and physiological characteristics of the plants including dry matter 

production and ability to adapt to saline environments; 

• to determine the amounts of salts (ions) accumulated by salt removing species; 

• to improve the conventional techniques of soil in the local conditions of Uzbekistan; 

and 

• to combine the new clean techniques with the old conventional techniques in order to 

establish the best balance between economical, environmental and social aspects, 

improving the sustainability of the ecosystem. 



Literature Review

II – LITERATURE REVIEW 

Soil salinity is of common occurrence in arid and semi-arid zones wherever irrigated 

agriculture has been practiced. According to several reports, there is a total area of 987.5 

million hectares in the world occupied by problematic soils, and around 322.9 million 

hectares are considered as saline and sodic soils (Brinkman, 1980). As an example of this 

problem, Szabolcs (1989) reported that 10 percent of the world’s arable land is on saline 

alkali soils. Soil salinization is a major problem in Uzbekistan and consequently, irrigated 

area is being tremendously damaged. 

Broadly, many international researches indicated that salinity management can be 

considered in a two stage process: 1) Use of conventional techniques – soil leaching, 

combination of salts and fertilizers, subsurface trickle irrigation, and salt tolerant species, 

and 2) Application of new clean and environmentally useful techniques – salt removing 

species, drought tolerant crops and regulated deficit irrigation. 

 

II.1 – Conventional Techniques 

II.1.1 - Soil Leaching 

Leaching is practiced for reclamation and for maintaining salt balance in the soil by 

irrigation water application (Pereira, et al., 1996). Moreover, Gupta and Chandra (1972) 

stated that due to world shortages of freshwater, saving in freshwater can be achieved by 

performing part of the leaching with saline water which is less saline than the soil to be 

leached. Thus, it is important to establish the threshold salinities of water draining from the 

root zone to determine leaching requirements. Meanwhile, to estimate leaching 

requirements, both the irrigation water salinity (ECw) and the crop tolerance to soil salinity

(ECe) should be known, which can be estimated in the laboratory conditions. The necessary 

leaching requirement (LR) can be estimated for a particular crop by using the following 

equation (Rhoades, 1974; and Rhoades &amp;amp; Merill, 1976): 

 

 

where:       LR    -     the minimum leaching requirement needed to control salts within the 

tolerance (ECe) of the crop with ordinary surface methods of irrigation 

       ECw   -  salinity of the applied irrigation water in dS m-1 

      ECe    -  average soil salinity tolerated by the crop as measured on a soil 

saturation extract (dS m-1) 

Moreover, the total annual depth of water that needs to be applied to meet both the crop 

demand and leaching requirement should be identified. The following equation can be used 

for that: 

 
where:       AW - depth of applied water (mm year-1) 

       ET  -  total annual crop water demand (mm year-1) 

       LR -   leaching requirement 

In general, soil salinity in many other 

regions of Uzbekistan as well as in the 

study region is controlled by leaching of the 

soil with extra freshwater since the study 

region is highly affected by salinity (Fig. 

II.1). Djanibekov (2005) pointed out that on 

average, 4300 m3 ha-1 of water is applied 

for leaching on 85 % of the irrigated land in Khorezm. However, intense use of this 

leaching technique attracted public awareness of environmental pollution and the impact on

aquifers. For instance, UKPC (2002) mentioned that application of huge amounts of water 

to wash the salts from the soil in Khorezm led to raise the groundwater level near the 

surface resulting in large amount of salts moving from the lower soil strata to the surface 

layers. Consequently, this strategy increases the risk of resalinization in the root zone. As a 

result, soil leaching process has to be repeated every cropping season in order to avoid 

build-up of high salt concentration. 

Furthermore, after leaching, water runs into the drainage systems and when the salt-

contaminated drainage water returns to the Amudarya River, it has severe impact on the 

ecosystems of the river and wetlands. It can be presumed that drainage water contains not 

only salt but also pesticide residue, fertilizers, defoliants and other agrochemicals, which 

enter the rivers, destroys the fine balance of nature and deteriorates water quality in these 

water bodies. 

 
II.1.2 - Combination of Salts and Fertilizers 

The application of fertilizers, namely nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) has become an 

alternative approach for farmers to combat soil salinity and to maximize agricultural crop 

production. Enhanced fertilization leads to increase of plant salinity tolerance. 

Initially, Mass and Hoffman (1977) proposed that the effect of salinity on yield could be 

described with a piece-wise linear response function characterized by a salinity “threshold” 

value below which the yield is unaffected by soil salinity and above which yield decreases 

linearly as salt concentrations increase (Fig. II.2). Later on, Beltrao et al. (2002) have 

modeled the combined effects of salts and nitrogen (N) on the crop yield function and 

proved that tolerance (threshold salinity value) for N1 is lower than for N2, which means 

that relative yield maintains constant at 100% until C for N1 and D for N2 (Fig. II.3). On the 



Literature Review 

 9 
 

other hand, sensitivity (rate of yield reduction per unit of salinity) is larger for N1 than for 

N2, which interprets with the higher values of the salinity threshold, the relative yield 

decreases sharply until zero. 

In addition, Mass and Hoffman (1977) proposed that relative crop yield Yr (%) for any 

given soil salinity exceeding the threshold could be calculated according to the following 

formula: 

 
where:  b  -  the slope represents the crop sensitivity (yield losses per unit increase of 

electrical conductivity). 

  a  -  the salinity threshold value (crop tolerance, expressed in dS m-1). 

  ECe – the mean electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract of root zone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, Achilea (2002) stated that constant application of potassium nitrate is an 

efficient method of preventing salinity-induced stresses in many crops. However, one of the 

main negative consequences of enhanced fertilization to mitigate soil salinity is to increase 

of environmental contamination through chemical hazards (Beltrao &amp;amp; Ben Asher, 1997). 

 
II.1.3 - Subsurface Trickle Irrigation

decades primarily due to increased pressure to conserve water resources and to control

salinity. This conventional technique, the application of water below the soil surface 

through emitters, allows for the direct application of water into the plant root-zones 

achieving more manageable, balanced water distribution throughout a relative shallow soil 

profile, hence minimizing potential groundwater depletion (Gushiken, 1995). Furthermore, 

STI reduces losses to evaporation from the soil surface, economizes water resources, and 

less additional salts will be used. Lamm (2002) highlighted that STI technique is also useful 

for controlling weeds and the enhancement of plant growth, crop yield and quality.  

However, Oron and Beltrao (1993) pointed out that the problem of groundwater 

contamination due to natural rain or artificial leaching remains. In addition, Lamm (2002) 

pointed out that SDI may restrict plant root development and tillage operation may also be 

limited by dripline placement. 

II.1.4 - Salt Tolerant Species 

In most developing countries, due to the expansion of population, fertile soils and fresh 

water resources are becoming insufficient. Besides, Shay (1990) mentioned that saline soil 

areas are continuously increasing throughout the world. About over 2 million hectares are 

affected by salinity in Uzbekistan. For the Solonchak soils to achieve economically viable 

and environmentally non-degradable land, many scientists have proposed to use salt 

tolerant species. The use of salt tolerant species, or halophytes, has great potential for 

landscaping and building greenification in the salt affected soils. Meanwhile, Lieth et al. 

(1997) stated that a number of halophytes are also useful for food, feed and ornamental 

purposes. Black (2004) pointed out that salt tolerant species have the ability to resist and 

grow under high winds, salt spray, alkaline soils9 and infertile, sandy soil conditions.

In addition, Akjigitova (1981) and Hinsinger (1998) highlighted that halophytic plants are 

capable of producing high biomass production under saline conditions.  

Mass and Hoffman (1977) divided the crops into four salinity rating groups: sensitive, 

moderately sensitive, moderately tolerant and tolerant (Table II.1).

As seen, the use of salt tolerant species is a useful technique to combat with salinity in the 

salt-affected zones. However, Hamdy (2002) highlighted that it does not solve the problem 

of soil salinity and groundwater contamination. 

 

II.2 - Clean and Environmentally Useful Techniques 

II.2.1 - Salt Removing Species 

Phytoremediation – salt removing species have become the best technique to remediate 

saline soils and decontaminate the environment (Anac et al., 2005).  Ebbs and Kochian 

(1997) pointed out that the ideal plant to remediate salt affected soils would be a high 

biomass producing crop that can not only tolerate but also accumulate the salts. High salt 

uptake species potentially could be integrated into cultivation/rotation programmes. 

In recent years, Matjanova (1999) and Davletmuradova (2002) investigated naturally grown 

wild desert plants in Karakalpakstan (north of Uzbekistan) as potential salt removing 

species and proposed dividing them into five categories according to their halo-adaptation 

and halo-tolerance: hyper-halophytes (may accumulate 21-29 % of soluble salts from soil), 

euhalophytes (12 - 13 %), hemi-halophytes (10.2 - 10.9 %), halo-glycophytes (6.2 – 8.3 %) 

and glycophytes (3.6 – 5.1 %). However, the main concern of their research was 

ontogenetic10 aspects of the wild species. 

In general, this new technique to mitigate salinity is a powerful and environmentally clean 

tool to maintain the sustainability of the agricultural areas and landscapes (Neves et al., 

2005). However, there is lack of information regarding this technique, and, additional 

research is needed.

II.2.2 - Drought Tolerant Species 

Drought and high salinity are common stress conditions that adversely affect plant growth 

and crop production (Xiong et al., 2002).  In both cases, the ability of plants to take up 

water is restricted and this leads to reduction of growth rate. Moreover, as the global 

climate is rapidly changing towards longer dry seasons and infrequent rainfall, it is 

anticipated that such changes will affect water supply to the plants, especially in arid and 

semi-arid zones (Farooq &amp;amp; Azam, 2001). As Gassemi et al. (1995) pointed out, crop 

productivity in most of the areas has already been affected by salinity. Any further 

deterioration induced by drought might result in the collapse of agricultural systems. In 

recent years, many researchers stated that induction of drought tolerant species could 

potentially be the best method to avoid this. 

Generally, “drought tolerant species” refers to plants which are associated with tolerance of 

water-deficit stress and well adapted to high temperatures and other abiotic stresses. Since 

they consume less water, naturally fewer salts will be infiltrated into the soil. 

In reality, the most drought tolerant species are usually the plants native to the specific area. 

With the help of initiatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of 

Uzbekistan, drought tolerant species have been introduced into 500 hectares to afforest and 

to protect forest belts on the dried seafloor near the Aral Sea in the northern part of 

Uzbekistan.

II.2.3 - Deficit Irrigation 

Intensive irrigation of agricultural crops with high level of water mineralization causes salts 

to accumulate in the root zones, which adversely affects the crop productivity. In order to 

reduce such negative impacts, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) technique was adopted to 

combat salinization in the arid and semi-arid environments by reducing the water 

application during certain growth stages of the crops (Cameron et al., 2006). Furthermore, 

Ben Mechila (2002) pointed out that one way to control or at least to postpone salinization 

in horticulture is the use of RDI. He also mentions that development of small irrigation 

schemes in the saline soils could be the best way to manage the field properly. Occasional 

heavy rains may also help take salts from this small area to places where they can 

concentrate with a minimum effect on the natural resources. Meanwhile, Beltrao et al. 

(1999) proposed that RDI can be obtained in two cases: 1) decrease the amount of added 

salt by reducing irrigation water supply, which also improves agricultural productivity and, 

2) apply minimal levels of water to obtain a good visual appearance (GVA) of the 

landscape. 

The proper application of less water to the plants can generate significant savings in 

irrigation water allocation and apparently, less salts will be infiltrated (Kirda, 2000). 

Moreover, they classified some crops as tolerance to less irrigation water either throughout 

the growing season or at pre-determined growth stages taking into account yield response.  

In addition, Costa et al. (2002) proved that application of minimal water level could be 

sufficient for some plants to obtain GVA of the landscape. For instance, they analyzed 

Bermuda grass and obtained good visual appearance where crop coefficient kc &gt; 1.7 (kc - 

represents water consumption rate), and kc &gt; 0.6 when potable water irrigation + nitrogen

III - MATERIALS AND METHODS 

III.1 - Geographical Location 

The study area is located in the Gurlan district, Khorezm Region, northwest part of 

Uzbekistan, in the lower reaches of Amudarya River (100 meters above sea level), which is 

the major water source for all water sectors in Khorezm. The region covers an area of about 

6,100 km2 and is spread between 40.49 and 41.97 N and 60.21 and 62.18 E of the 

Greenwich meridian, or about 245 km south of the remainders of the Aral Sea (Fig. III.1).

Amudarya River is a supplier of water for the whole Khorezm Region and in the last years, 

the water amount has been tremendously reduced because of intensive upstream utilization 

(Djalalov et al., 2005). The river provides irrigation water for 231 000 ha of which more 

than 12 % are severely saline. The region contributes to 15% of the national Uzbekistan 

river water withdrawals. And water withdrawal for agriculture is estimated at 94% of the 

whole regional water withdrawals (Schieder, 2004).  

The region has become particularly vulnerable to short and long-term droughts, as a result 

during the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons resulted in major crop failures (WHO, 2001). 

Consequently, the agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has become one of the 

lowest in Uzbekistan (Djalalov et al., 2005). Moreover, the socio-economic and public 

health situation in the region has been worsening due to geographical proximity to the 

ecologically degraded Aral Sea (Khamzina 2006). 

Khorezm borders with Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakistan in the North and East, 

with Turkmenistan in the South and West, with the Bukhara region in the South and East. 

The population of the region is equal to 1 324 000 people, 24% of which reside in towns 

and the density is equal to 217,4 people per km2 (Gulomov et al., 2001). The population 

growth rate has averaged 2.8% over the past 11 years (MMS, 1999). The Khorezm region 

is divided into ten administrative districts with Urgench as the administrative center. The 

population of Urgench is equal to 139 000 people whereas experimental district’s (Gurlan) 

population is around 27 300 people. About 80% of Khorezm’s population resides in rural 

areas and is engaged in cotton production, which is the main cultivated crop for that region, 

followed by winter wheat, rice and various other crops.

III.2 – Climatic Conditions 

The study area is situated in the Central Asian semi desert zone with an extremely 

continental climate (Glazirin et al., 1999). Potential evapotranspiration exceed precipitation 

during the most parts of the year. It is also considered as daily temperature fluctuation 

region with long hot dry summers, infrequent rains in spring-autumn and very cold 

temperatures during winter. Annual precipitation of the region is determined as 100-120 

mm, which falls mostly outside of growing season in autumn-winter period (Fig. III.2). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Local potential evapotranspiration (ET) is about 1,600 mm/year greatly exceeds 

precipitation (Glavgidromet, 2006). Thus, large scale irrigation for cultivated crops is 

essential to this area. The mean annual air temperature (T) is 13
o
C, whereas monthly 

average maximum and minimum temperatures can reach + 37
o 

C and – 13

C, respectively 

(Fig. III.3).

Potential evapotranspiration (ETp) greatly exceeded from rainfall during the study period.

meteorological data for the study site, Ivanov´s formula with a regional coefficient K of 0.8 

was used to calculate ETp for the experimental periods (Clarke et al., 1991). Meanwhile,

III.3 - Experimental Design and Plant Collection 

Portulaca oleracea golden purslane seeds were planted in two different salt-affected soils 

of Khorezm Region and reported as field 1 and field 2 in this study. The size of the land 

was 16 m2 for field 1 and 49 m2 for field 2. Furthermore, field 3 was used for naturally 

grown wild species. The experiment was held in the lands of Vazir Water Users 

Associations (WUA), Gurlan city. In this study, field 1 was not irrigated while field 2 was 

irrigated twice with 0.78 dS m-1 salinity level of canal water. Irrigation was of 30 and 25 

min duration which allowed the soil to be completely saturated and flow rates were 0.438 

and 0.144 m3 min-1. A research was carried out for three months of summer period (July, 

August and September) and the duration of the experiment was 49 days for field 1 and 58 

days for field 2. 

The plants were harvested twice, in the developing and seedling stages of Portulaca 

oleracea golden purslane. Meanwhile, selected native naturally grown wild species were 

harvested at the same time of that P.oleracea golden purslane to evaluate their efficiency to 

remove salts. 

In both cases, all plant samples were 

taken, plant height was measured, they 

were weighed, washed with tap water 

and distilled water, oven dried at 70O C 

for 48 hours (Fig. III.6), re-weighed,

the remaining cations were assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a 

Shimadzu, AA-680 model spectrometer. Chloride (Cl

) ions were determined in the 

aqueous extract by potentiometer using a Crison, pH meter GLP 22 after extraction in cold 

water. 

 

III.4 - Soil and Water Measurement 

Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have classified four 

different types of soil in Khorezm Region: mostly aridic and gleyic calcaric (sodic) 

Arenosols and calcaric Cambisols, whilst gleyic humus Fluvisols are commonly originated 

along the Amudarya River (Khamzina, 2006). In most cases, the thickness of alluvial 

sediments in or nearby to the river bed have 35-70 cm thick sands whereas former lake 

locations are characterized by loam and clay (Fayzullaev, 1980). Total Nitrogen and 

Phosphorus contents in these soil types are very low, usually ranging between 0.03 - 0.15% 

and 0.060 - 0.18%, respectively. Since the natural fertility of the soils in the region is 

relatively low, thus, heavy applications of chemical fertilizers are required in order to 

cultivate agricultural crops. 

Soils were sampled by horizon (stratification) in three places of each site to describe the 

soil profile (Fig. III.7). Three 0.5 m deep pits were located in two P.oleracea fields, 

representing both ends and the middle of the experimental site, and 

one  0.5 m deep pit was dug in each field of naturally grown wild 

species. The soil sample was collected from 5 soil layers (0-10, 10-

20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 cm) using auger to analyze for texture,

bulk density, infiltration rate, wilting point, field capacity, total N as well as available P and 

K. Moreover, different soil depth samples (0-15, 15-30, 30-45 cm) were collected to 

determine soil salinity. Samples were collected from within and between rows of 

P.oleracea plants and combined. 

The samples were analyzed by the Central Laboratory of the Uzbek Research Institute of 

Cotton Growing (UzRICG). 

In order to measure the electrical conductivity (ECw) of groundwater, irrigation water and 

drainage water, the water samples were taken from the experimental fields to the 

laboratory. 

 

III.5 – Tested Crops

Golden Purslane in Study Area 

Portulaca oleracea golden purslane is characterized by a short harvesting period and 

relatively resistant to salinity (Fig. III.8). It is widely used as food consumption in daily life 

of human. Leaves and stems of this plant can be eaten raw or cooked. The young leaves are 

a very acceptable addition to salads, their mucilaginous quality also making them a good 

substitute for okra as a thickener in soups (Grieve, 1984). Older leaves are used as a 

potherb. Furthermore, in many places of the world, particularly in Central Asia, chopped 

leaves of the Portulaca oleracea is used in the national food “samsa”.  

Additionally, it has medicinal importance, e.g. the leaves 

of Portulaca oleracea are a rich source of omega-3 fatty 

acids, which is thought to be important in preventing 

heart attacks and strengthening the immune system. A tea 

made from the leaves is used in the treatment of stomach 

aches and headaches. The leaves can be harvested at any 

time before the plant flowers; they are used fresh or 

dried. However, this remedy is not given to pregnant 

women or to patients with digestive problems (Brown, 1995). 

Moreover, the selected Tamarix hispida 

crop is characterized as an easily grown 

plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant 

of saline conditions (Fig. III.9). It grows 

well in heavy clay as well as sandy soils. It 

is also tolerant of maritime winds and dry 

soils when grown near the coast, plants 

require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in

non-saline soils because they use soil salt that are found in saline soils to help them reduce 

transpiration (Bochansev et al., 1955). This plant is mainly used to stabilize the soil and 

also to make a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens. The plant can be found in East and 

Central Asia – Caspian Sea to Manchuria.  

Apocynum lancifolium is a wild halophytic species 

widely distributed in the northern part of Uzbekistan 

(Fig. III.10). The stems of this plant are from 80 to 

200 cm tall, glabrous except for inflorescences; 

braches and branchlets whitish gray, terete, finely 

striate. This plant can be found in the salt-barren 

zones, desert margins, alluvial flats, riversides. 

The strong bast fibers obtained from the inner bark 

are used in making cloth, strings, sails, fishing nests, and high-quality paper. The leaves 

yield up to 5% gum, which is used for making rubber, and a medicine used as a sedative 

and to treat hypertension. The species has fragrant flowers and is grown as a honey plant 

(Bondarenko et al., 1961). 

The physical characteristics of the Karelinia 

caspia is: stems from 50 to 100 cm length 

(Fig. III.11). The calathidiums are cylindrical, 

width 4-8 mm, length 10-15 mm. Flowers are 

pink-lilac in color. Cypselas are wedge-

shaped, slightly arcuated with vague blunt 

and puce color. Pappus is almost 10 times

longer than cypsela (Bondarenko et al., 1962). It can be found in the salt marshes, coastline 

and riversides, usually occurs as weed in the abandoned lands, and also cultivated in saline 

lands. Furthermore, it can serve as animal grazing, particularly sheep, goat and cow feed. 

Glycyrrhiza glabra is one of the most widely used species of Glycyrrhiza. It is used 

traditionally to relieve coughs and sore throats, and against gastric inflammation. One of 

the main active ingredients is glycyrrhizin, which has a cortisone-like effect and, 

additionally, is 50 times sweeter than sucrose (Borisova et al., 1955). Apart from its 

medicinal applications, it is employed as a flavoring agent in sweets and tobacco, and as a 

foaming agent in fire extinguishers and beer (WWF). The plant is 1.2-1.8m tall, leaves 

pinnate with 9-17 leaflets and flowers pale blue, pea-like. It is widely distributed in Eurasia, 

including the Mediterranean region, China, India, Central Asia and western Siberia.  

Alhagi pseudalhagi is a noxious weed13 in the US 

but a medicinal plant in the Asia (Fig. III.12). This 

green shrub is to 1 - 2 m tall, with simple leaves, 

many thorny branches, and an extensive root 

system. Plants spread rapidly by clonal vegetative 

reproduction from vigorous rhizomes. This desert 

plant introduced from the Mediterranean region and 

Central Asia. The whole plant is diaphoretic, 

diuretic, expectorant and laxative. Oil from the 

leaves is used in the treatment of rheumatism. The flowers are used in the treatment of piles 

(Bown, 1995). Extensive rhizomes present. Woody root system can grow more than 2 m

deep and to a distance of 8 (12) m or more in all directions. Rhizomes at depths to 1.5 m 

produce new shoots and deep vertical roots at about 1-1.5 m intervals. 

Chenopodium album (Fat Hen; also called white goosefoot, lamb's quarters, or pigweed), is 

a fast-growing, upright, weedy annual species of goosefoot, very common in temperate 

regions, growing almost everywhere in soils rich in nitrogen, especially on wasteland. Its 

pollen can contribute to hayfever-like allergies. It tends to grow upright at first, reaching 

heights of 30-80 cm, but typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of 

the foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants (Bochansev et al., 1953). Fat Hen 

can be eaten as a vegetable, either steamed in entirety, or the leaves cooked like spinach as 

a leaf vegetable. Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds. These are very 

nutritious, high in protein, vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Quinoa is a 

closely related species grown specifically for its seeds (www.wikipedia.org). As the 

common name suggests, it is also a very good feed (both the leaves and the seeds) for 

chickens (hens) and other poultry. Furthermore, according to the PFFD report, the plant can 

be discovered around the world. 

Native naturally grown Portulaca oleracea green 

purslane was also assessed to its potential salt 

removal capacity (Fig. III.13). The whole 

characteristics of this purslane are the same as of 

golden purslane but it is more unpleasant. This green 

purslane is mainly used as poultry feed in Central 

Asia.

III.6 - Laboratory Analysis of Soil-Plant-Water 

III.6.1 - Physical-Chemical Analytical Methods for Soil 

The soil samples were analyzed for physical and chemical properties in the field and 

laboratory conditions. The methods of the analysis are described below. 

 

 



Materials and Methods 

 29 
 

III.6.1.1 – Texture 

Soil texture was determined according to the Kachinskii pipette method (Plusnin et al., 

1974). A weighed 20 gram of air-dried soil placed into porcelain flask. 12 mL of sodium 

oxalate solution along with 8 mL of deionized water was added to the flask. The sample 

was mixed and transferred into the 250 mL flask filled with deionized water to heat up. 

After cooling, the sample was transferred to the 1 L cylinder flask to quantify the soil 

texture through titration. The flask was filled with deionized water and mixed carefully. 

The cylinder flask was installed into the titration device and through pipettes the device 

took the sample from the flask with 20-25 mL volume. 

In total, the soil was differentiated into seven size classes with the following diameters:      

&gt; 0.25; 0.25-0.1; 0.1-0.05; 0.05-0.01; 0.01-0.005; 0.005-0.001;&amp;lt;0.001 mm according to 

Kachinsky´s method and converted to the American texture classification (Annex 3). The 

first two fractions were determined through washing the sieves whereas the last four 

through pipettes. The fraction weight of 0.1-0.05 mm calculated with the difference 

between initial soil sample weight (20 g) and sum of six fractions. The calculations of soil 

fraction weights B (%) was performed using following equation: 

 

 

where: P – weight of appropriate fraction (g) 

 20 – amount of soil samples (g) 

 25 – volume of pipette (mL) 

 1000 – volume of cylinder (mL) 

Moreover, the following equation was applied to calculate first two fractions (&gt; 0.25; 0.25-

0.1), washed in sieves: 

25*20
1000*100*P

B = (III.2)

where: B – content of fraction (%) 

 P – weight of fraction (g) 

 20 – amount of soil samples (g) 

In addition, the fraction 0.1-0.05 mm was quantified by the difference between soil sample 

weight and sum of obtained fraction. 

 

III.6.1.2 – Soil Water Content 

The soil moisture at the nonsaline wilting point (WP) and at the field capacity (FC) was 

determined for field 1 and field 2 by gravimetric method (Annex 3) and was calculated at 

the field (Beltrao, 1996; Ben Asher, 2002). The samples were analyzed by gravimetric 

method and later on, converted into a volumetric basis by considering the bulk density of 

the respective soil layers (determined in the soil pits).  

 
 
III.6.1.3 - Bulk Density 

The soil bulk density (BD) was determined 

using core sampler to inquire the soil 

compactness (Blake &amp;amp; Hartge, 1986). The soil 

samples were collected from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 

cm depths using shovel and core sampler (Fig. 

III.14). A core weight recorded, soil moist 

along with core was recorded, moist soil

Rate in the Investigated Field 

placed into the tin cans, transferred to the laboratory, the tin cans and soil weighed, oven- 

dried at 105
o
C for 6 hours, cooled in a desiccator and reweighed. The following equation 

was used to calculate the bulk density (BD), expressed as g cm-3: 

 

 

where: W – soil sample weight (g) 

C – core weight (g) 

A – gravimetric soil moisture (%), determined using soil moist and oven-dry weight 

V – volume of core (cm3) 

 r – core radius = 3.75 cm 

 h – core height = 5 cm 

 

III.6.1.4 - Infiltration Rate 

The infiltration rate was measured for field 1 and field 2 using cylinder infiltrometer to 

know the velocity at which water moves into the ground (Pankov, 1957). Field 3 was 

analyzed for soil texture and thus, was not measured for infiltration rate in this study. It is 

known that infiltration rate is directly correlated with texture and can be predicted by 

looking at the soil texture results. 

Infiltration rate was measured by the depth (in 

mm) of the water layer that can enter the soil in 

one hour. A cylinder with the diameter of 22.5 

cm was hammered into the soil in the 

experimental fields. The timber was used to 

protect the ring from the damage during 

hammering. The cylinder was kept vertically,

so approximately 15 cm was left above the ground. Additionally, 55 cm cylinder was 

constructed an earth bund around the 22.5 cm cylinder to the same height as the cylinder 

and placed the hessian inside the infiltrometer to protect the soil surface when pouring the 

water (Fig. III.15). 

Afterwards, the water was poured into the cylinder and to the space between the two 

cylinders. The time was recorded to know the infiltration rate. After 4-5 minutes, the drop 

in water level in the inner cylinder was recorded and water added to bring the level back to 

approximately the original level at the start of the test. The test was continued about 6 hours 

while keeping the water level the same over the same time interval, but as the time goes on 

the interval between readings was extended (e.g. 20-30 minutes). Meantime, infiltration 

volume was recorded each time of water adding. The final infiltration rate (f), expressed as 

mm h-1, was calculated as following:

  t -  time differences (min.) 

 S – inner cylinder area (cm2), determined through             equation 

  d – inner cylinder diameter = 22.5 cm   

 

 

III.6.1.5 - Total Nitrogen 

The Kjeldahl method was used to determine total nitrogen (N) in the soil (McGill &amp;amp; 

Figueiredo, 1993). The soil samples were air-dried, ground and sieved before analysis.  

This method is divided into three phases:

- Digestion – 1 gram of sieved soil placed in a dry digestion tube. 5 mL of deionized H2O 

was added and swirled to wet all the soil. Then, 25 mL of concentrated H2SO4 was added 

and placed into the digestion block in 450
o
C for 4 hours. 

- Distillation – the digested samples were transferred to a distillation flask, which was 

connected to the steam distillation apparatus. Samples were neutralized with sodium 

hydroxide. In order to receive and keep the N distilled, 10 mL of 4% (weight/volume) boric 

acid was added to the flask. 

- Titration – the distillate was titrated with 0.01 M sulphuric acid. The color changed at the 

end point from green to pink. The following equation was used to compute total N (%) in 

the soil: 

 

where: V – volume of H2SO4 spent in the titration (mL) 

 f –  H2SO4 concentration (M) 

 m – mass of the sample (g) 

 0.28 – 1 mL of 0.01 M H2SO4 is equivalent to 0.28 mg of N 

 

 

III.6.1.6 - Potassium and Phosphorus 

Machigin method was used to determine available potassium and phosphorus in the soil of 

experimental area (Radov et al., 1971). Five grams of sieved soil were placed into a 250 

mL conical retort and filled up with 100 mL of 1% (w/v) ammonium carbonate solution. 

The suspension was shaken for about 5 minutes and stored for 24 hours. During this time it 

was shaken every 6 hours. Afterwards, the suspension was filtered and the filtrate was 

analyzed for potassium (K+) by flame-photometry.

Fig. III.16 - Soil Extraction 

 In order to analyze phosphorus, the filtrate was decolorized by adding dilute sulphuric acid 

and 0.5 M potassium permanganate solutions. The mixture was then boiled for 2 minutes. 

After adding 1 mL of 10 % (w/v) glucose, the solution was cooled and neutralized with 10 

% (w/v) Na2CO3 solution in the presence of an indicator. In addition, to the 50 mL of 

colorless mixture, 2 mL of molybdenum reagent solution and 0.5 mL stannous chloride 

were added. After 5 minutes, the phosphorus was analyzed colorimetically.  

 

 

III.6.1.7 - Salinity 

The analysis for determining soil salinity was 

conducted according to Machigin’s (1963) method 

using an aqueous extract of the soil (ratio 1:5, i.e. 

30 gram of air-dry soil and 150 mL of distilled 

water). The sample solution was 4 times shaken for 

1 minute at a 30 minute interval and allowed to stay 

24 hours in order the soil to settle (Fig. III.16). Afterwards, the solution was filtered and 

prepared to quantify for total dissolved solids (TDS) and salt ion compositions (Cl
-
, Na+, 

K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) at the UzRICG laboratory (Annex 4). 

This USSR classification of soil salinity, used in Central Asia, based on laboratory 

measurements of the TDS (%), was converted according to FAO classification, in electrical 

conductivity of saturated soil extract (ECe). The standard unit for ECe is deciSiemens per 

meter (dS m-1).

the Soil using Titration Method 

III.6.1.7.1 - Chloride 

Potassium chromate was used as an indicator in the 

determination of chlorides in the soil by titration 

with standard AgNO3 solution (Machigin, 1963). 

This method is called the Mohr method of 

determining Cl
-
 and is based on the formation of a 

red precipitate of silver chromate (Ag2CrO4) at the 

end point, after all the Cl
-
 has been precipitated as 

white AgCl. To 10 mL of the sample solution, 2-3 

drops of 10% (w/v) K2CrO4 solution was added 

and titrated with 0.01 N of AgNO3 until the appearance of a reddish color (Fig. III.17). The 

following equation was used to quantify Cl
-
 content (X), expressed in percentage, in the air-

dried soil: 

 

where: a – volume of 0.01 N AgNO3, spent for titration (mL) 

0.00035 – this amount of gram Cl
-
 corresponds 1 mL 0.01N AgNO3  

E – volume of water sample (mL) 

M – volume of sample solution (mL) 

W – amount of soil sample (g) 

 

III.6.1.7.2 - Sodium and Potassium 

The analyses of Na+ and K+ in the soil were performed using flame photometry method 

(Samokhvalov et al., 1999). Standard solutions were prepared and calibration curves were

plotted. For sodium, NaCl 0.005 N was used and 0.2923 g of dried NaCl was dissolved in 

one liter of extracting solution. For potassium, KCl 0.005 N was used and 0.3728 g of dried 

KCl was dissolved in one liter of extracting solution. In the case of high concentrations of 

K+ and Na+, appropriate dilutions with extracting solution were performed. Obtained results 

were converted into percentage using Annex 5 and 6. 

 

III.6.1.7.3 - Calcium and Magnesium 

The Calcium (Ca2+) and Magnesium (Mg2+) concentrations in the in the examined soil 

profiles of the experimental fields were determined by titration method (Machigin &amp;amp; 

Protasov, 1963). To determine the sum of Ca2+ and Mg2+, 10 mL of the sample solution 

was taken and diluted with distilled water. After addition of 5 mL of ammonium chloride 

and 2-3 drops of darkish chromogen, the mixture was titrated with 0.05 N Trilon B solution 

until the appearance of a blue color. 

To quantify Ca2+ separately, 10 mL of the sample solution was taken and diluted with 

distilled water. After the addition of 2 mL of potassium hydroxide, the mixture was titrated 

with 0.05 N Trilon B solutions until the appearance of a violet color. 

Mg2+ was quantified by subtraction of the result of Ca2+ from the result of Ca2+ + Mg2+. 

The following equation was used to perform calculation: 

 

 

In order to convert into percentage based, the molecular weight (n) of ions was used:

III.6.1.7.4 - Total Dissolved Solids 

Gravimetric method was used to measure total dissolved solids (often abbreviated TDS), 

which is the most accurate and involve evaporating the liquid solvent to leave a residue 

(Position Paper, 2003). In order to measure TDS, 20 mL of sample solution was placed into 

a 100 mL beaker and allowed the liquid to evaporate in the oven at 105
o
C for 3 hours. 

When the beaker was dry, it was cooled in a dessicator and reweighed. The following 

formula was used to calculate TDS, expressed in percentage (Annex 4 a): 

 

 

where: a – mass of beaker after water evaporated (g) 

b – tare weight of beaker (g) 

E – volume of water sample (mL) 

M – volume of sample solution (mL) 

W – amount of soil sample (g) 

 

 

III.6.2 - Chemical Analytical Methods for Plants 

Plant materials were extracted to measure chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium and 

magnesium concentrations in a Laboratory of the University of Algarve (UALG). Chloride 

was extracted using cold water at room temperature (23-25
o
C), according to the procedure 

proposed by Drew and Saker (1984), whereas the cations were extracted by a dry-ash 

method at 5500C incinerator using a Thermolyne, Type 1500 Furnace (Yeo &amp;amp; Gullasch, 

1977).

In the case of chloride, a 100 mg of ground shoot material was stirred in a glass vial with 

50 mL of deionized water at room temperature (23-25
o
C) using three replicates. The 

supernatant was filtered and stored in a volumetric flask (Fig. III.18). 

1 gram of ground shoot material was 

weighed, placed into a glass liquid 

scintillation vial and ashed in a muffle 

furnace for 6 h at 5500C to measure 

cations. After cooling, the ash was 

dissolved with 10 mL of 0.1 N HCl 

solutions in a heater. The samples were 

filtered and filled up with deionized water until 100 mL in a volumetric flask. 

 

 

III.6.2.1 – Chloride 

The potentiometric method, pH/mV meter, 

was used with double Junction Reference 

Electrode and Chloride Ion Electrode to 

measure Cl
- 

concentrations in the dry matter 

(Fig. III.19). By serial dilution of the 1000 

ppm standards, 100 and 10 ppm chloride 

standards were prepared. 2 mL of a Ionic 

Strength Adjuster (ISA) was added per 100 mL of standard. Using the semi-logarithmic 

graph paper, the mV reading (linear axis) was plotted against the concentration (log axis). 



Materials and Methods 

 39 
 

The curve was extrapolated down to about 1 ppm to build up a calibration curve. 

Afterwards, to the dry 100 mL beaker, 50 mL of sample and 1 mL of ISA was added. The 

baker was placed into the magnetic stirrer. The electrode tips were placed into the solution 

and when the reading was stabilized, the mV reading was recorded. The concentration of 

chlorides in the dry shoot material was determined directly from the calibration curve with 

the unit of parts per million (ppm). Later, the ppm (equal to mg L-1) unit was converted to 

mg g-1 unit using the following equation:  

L = Fc * Se 

where: L – chloride concentration, expressed as mg g-1 

 Fc – chloride concentration given by the machine, expressed as mg L-1 

 Se  – extraction solution, expressed as L g-1;   S =

III.6.2.2 - Sodium and Potassium 

Flame photometry (FP) method was used to measure Na+ and K+ in the dry shoot material. 

In order to calibrate FP, a series of standard solutions were prepared containing exact and 

increasing amounts of a cation over a selected range. Moreover, standard concentrations 

were prepared using sodium or potassium standard solutions, i.e. to the 10 mL of sodium or 

potassium standard solution (1000 ppm) added 90 mL of deionized water to make 100 ppm 

solution. Afterwards, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mL of the 100 ppm solutions of K+ and Na+ were taken 

separately into 100 mL volumetric flask, filled with deionized water and read for 

calibration curve (Annex 7). After the calibration curve, the samples were placed into the 

machine. The necessary dilutions of the samples were prepared according to the results 

given by the FP machine. The machine has given in absorption and based on curve, it was

standards, 5 mL of strontium chloride (SrCl2) 

and 1 mL of 3 N HCl were added to each sample. The calibration curve was obtained using 

standard solutions (Annex 7). Moreover, to the 2 mL of extracted sample 50 mL of 

deionized water was added along with 5 mL SrCl2 and 1 mL of 3 N HCl. Appropriate 

dilutions were made in case of high concentrations of the analyzing ions.

of extraction and quantification was the same 

as used in soil salinity. At the end of the 

experiment, the results were obtained in g L-1. 

In the case of TDS, 50 mL of water was 

placed into the oven at 105
o
C for 3 hours to evaporate the water. The residue weight left 

after water has evaporated was recorded and the value was multiplied into initial water 

sample to obtain g L-1 unit. 

Later, this USSR classification to determine water mineralization based on laboratory 

measurements was converted, according to FAO classification, in electrical conductivity of 

water (ECw) and recorded as dS m-1. 

 
 
III.7 - Statistical analysis 

The data were subjected to standard analyses of variance using the One-Way ANOVA 

procedure of the SPSS 14.0 for Windows (SPSS, 2005) to compare mean values of Cl
-
 

concentrations, obtained through potentiometric method, with two different harvested 

months. Differences at the P?0.05 level were used as a test of significance and means were 

separated using the Duncan post hoc t-test (Annex 15).

Moreover, data of dry yield of plant samples was modeled using a linear regression 

equation, i.e. it was assumed that dry yield is a linear function and individual independent 

variables set as Cl
-
, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ concentrations and extraction of ions kilogram per 

hectare, which thought to be main parameters accounted for the changing of dry matter in 

the salinized lands of experimental field. The full derivation of this regression modeling 

technique is described in the Annex 15 (a &amp;amp; b).

IV.1 - Soil Characteristics in the Experimental Area 

The experimental area covered three fields in the region. As it was mentioned in the 

previous section, the following general investigations were carried out in each field to 

determine the soil characteristics: soil profile, bulk density, infiltration rate and soil water 

content. Furthermore, agrochemical properties and soil salinity were also assessed. The 

findings are described below. 

 

IV.1.1 – Texture 

The soil profile investigation showed that the soils in the study areas are partially stratified. 

According to Kachinsky´s classification (Handbook on Soil Science, 1980) the topsoil layer 

(0-20 cm) and middle layers (30-40 cm) of field 1 was medium loamy (Fig. IV.1, Annex 2). 

In field 2, the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) was heavy loamy whereas the subsoil layers (30-50 

cm) contained more silt and sand, thus were classified as medium loamy. Meanwhile, field 

3 had a lighter texture (loamy light topsoil followed by loamy sandy subsoil).

Results and Discussions

In addition, based on FAO (1998) classification and the results obtained, the soil of field 1 

can be classified as Fluvisols with histic horizon having fluvic soil material starting within 

25 cm from the soil surface and continuing to a depth of at least 50 cm from the soil 

surface. It should be noted that due to influence from the river, the soils always in change 

and thus, named as alluvial soils. 

Due to a heavy textured surface horizon, field 2 classified as Fluvisols with takyric horizon, 

which mainly occurs under semi-arid conditions. On the other hand, because of sandy and 

highly saline soils, field 3 was classified as Solonchak with calcic horizon having high 

calcium and salt content in the surface horizons. 

 

IV.1.2 - Bulk Density 

The soil bulk density data is shown in Annex 2. As can be seen in this table, the soil bulk 

density of field 2 ranged from 1.41-1.44 g cm-3 and averaged 1.43 g cm-3 over the examined 

profiles. For instance, in the topsoil layer from 0-10 cm, the density was 1.41 g cm-3, 

whereas the deeper subsoil layer from 10-30 cm, an increased of density 1.43 g cm-3 was 

observed. In the subsoil layer from 30-50 cm, the density was 1.44 g cm-3. Based on these 

results, this field can be characterized as a heavy loamy soil, with slow water movement 

between soil particles, high bulk density, soil water holding capacity is low and irrigation 

periods are long. 

On the other hand, with a fluvisols histic horizon soil structure, field 1 had lower bulk 

density than field 2. In the first 0-10 cm of soil depth, the bulk density was 1.35 g cm-3 and 

in the deeper soil layer, a higher bulk density was observed. Likewise, at 10-20 and 20-30 

cm soil depth, the bulk density was 1.36 and 1.37 g cm-3, respectively. In the 30-50 cm 

subsoil layer, the bulk density was observed as 1.39 g cm-3. An average, the bulk density of 



Results and Discussions 

 45 
 

the 0-50 cm soil layer was 1.37 g cm-3. This data shows that the soil is middle loamy, the 

soil water holding capacity is high, water fills the soil particles rapidly and infiltrates to the 

impermeable layer, and irrigation is required frequently. 

Furthermore, field 3 had sandy soils, thus, higher bulk density was observed. For instance, 

for the 0-50 cm soil depths, the soil bulk density averaged 1.60 g cm-3. As can be seen in 

Annex 2, the bulk density under the investigated fields was lower in the topsoil layers and 

increased with the depth of profiles. Generally, bulk density is related to soil texture and 

eluvia processes in the soil. It can be presumed, from the experimental results, that the 

volumetric weight of soil in field 1 could be appropriate and satisfactory to the growth and 

development of Portulaca oleracea as well as other potential salt-removing plants. 

 

IV.1.3 – Infiltration Rate 

Previous investigations showed that bulk density is related to water infiltration (Revut, 

1962; Voronin, 1996). The compaction of the soil leads to a decrease in the infiltration rate 

(Cheshev et al., 1978). The investigated soils were characterized by different percolation 

rates. The water infiltration was significantly higher during the two hours of experimental 

period in field 1 compared to field 2. The infiltration rate in field 1 ranged between 13.6-

173.5 mm h-1 and averaged 45.3 mm h-1 during an experimental period of six hours, which 

illustrates that a water layer of 45.3 mm on the soil surface, will take one hour to infiltrate 

(Fig. VI.2). During the early stages of infiltration, the highest infiltration rate was observed 

due to dry soil. As time went on, the water from the soil surface infiltrated more slowly 

because the air in the pores was replaced by water and eventually reached a steady rate.  

In principal, infiltration rate depends on soil texture and soil structure, and is the best way 

of categorizing soils from an irrigation point of view. In the field 1, obtained results showed 



Results and Discussions 

 46 
 

that with the medium loamy soil, irrigation water should be applied frequently since water 

is soaked/absorbed by the soil rapidly. 

On the other hand, infiltration rates in field 2 were observed to be relatively low compared 

to field 1, ranging between 2.0-52.5 mm h-1 and averaging 11.4 mm h-1 during the study six 

hours period. Therefore, it can be stated that the soil was at a saturation point where the 

macropores and micropores are full of water. More details on infiltration rates for the two 

experimental sites are reported in Annex 8. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
IV.1.4 – Soil Water Content 

In the field 1, the volumetric soil water content at nonsaline wilting point ranged between 

0.210-0.281 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.259 m3 m-3 over the examined soil profiles (Annex 3). 

This means that below this point the availability of soil water to the plant roots is limited. 

This is known as called hydroscopic water condition. It is interesting to note that topsoil 

layers had lower values compared to deeper layers, which illustrates that upper layers have 

drier soil and plants withdrew water rapidly. Meanwhile, volumetric soil water content at 

field capacity (FC) varied from 0.281 to 0.304 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.290 m3 m-3 in field 1.

It should be pointed out that topsoil layers showed higher values of field capacity (FC) than 

subsoil layers requiring higher irrigation amounts in upper layers. 

Moreover, field 2 results showed that the volumetric soil water content values at wilting 

point is closer to volumetric soil water content at field capacity, which illustrates the soil 

contains excess water. For instance, volumetric soil water content at wilting point ranged 

between 0.283-0.313 m3 m-3 and averaged 0.292 m3 m-3, while FC ranged between 0.298-

0.319 m3 m-3, averaging 0.305 m3 m-3, which can be interpreted as the maximum amount of 

water the soil can hold. Monitoring soil water content is essential in this field to optimize 

crop production, conserve water, reduce environmental impacts and save money. 

In addition, soil water content data in the fields investigated helps to improve irrigation 

decisions such as how much water to apply and when to apply it, to match water applied 

irrigation with crop water requirements and thus avoiding over-irrigating the crop. 

 

IV.1.5 – Agrochemical Properties 

It is known that the growth and development of crops depend on the availability of 

nitrogen, phosphorus, humus and other elements in the soil. The total nitrogen (N) in the 

soil, available phosphorus (expressed as P2O5) and humus content in the investigated fields 

are summarized in Fig. IV.3. As can be seen in Fig. IV.3, the content of total N, available 

P2O5 and humus in the field 1 soils were higher than in other fields. Furthermore, upper 

layers of soils had higher content of nutrients in all experimental fields.  

It can be noticed that the highest amount of potassium (140 mg K2O kg-1) was found in the 

topsoil layers of field 1 and the lowest (40 mg kg-1) in the subsoil layers of field 2 and 3 

(Annex 9). Likewise, upper layers showed higher concentrations of K2O than subsoil 

layers. 



Results and Discussions 

 48 
 

In general, the clay soils contain more nutrients whereas sandy soils are poor in organic 

matter, nitrogen and mineral nutrients. Meanwhile, loam soils have an intermediate position 

regarding soil properties and are usually more fertile than sandy soils. Since the soils of 

investigated fields have a silt-sand texture, they are poor in nutrients thus heavy application 

of fertilizers is essential in order to increase crop productivity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
IV.1.6 - Salinity 

The soil solution in the experimental fields had higher salt concentrations than irrigation 

water. The electrical conductivity of soil ECe (expressed as dS m-1) examined during the 

experimental period mostly corresponded to the degree of salinity ranging between slight 

and moderate (FAO classification, 1985). However, values above 8 dS m-1 have been 

observed. Such deviations towards a strong degree in soil salinity were more prominent in 

the fields with naturally grown plant fields (Fig. IV.4).

For instance, the degree of salinity in field 1, averaged over the 0-45 cm soil profile could 

be classified as low saline with an average electrical conductivity of 1.20 dS m-1. It should 

be pointed out that, before plantation, the field 1 was properly leached from the salinity and 

used as a pasture for animal feed. Thus, the soil salinity in this field was lower compared to 

other investigated fields. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Furthermore, adequate soil moisture conditions during the growing season of P.oleracea 

and input of highly saline groundwater to the plant roots, field 2 classified as slight to 

moderate degree of soil salinity ranging between 1.48-5.50 dS m-1. In all cases, the upper 

layers had higher salt concentrations than subsoil layers (Annex 4).

In field 3, the highest degree of soil salinity in a 0-15 cm soil layer was 14.4 dS m-1 (highly 

saline) in the T.hispida field whereas the lowest degree of 9.78 dS m-1 was observed in the 

G.glabra field at the same soil profile. It should be stated that due to accessibility and 

adequate quality of the groundwater resources in this field, the plant species exposed to soil 

ECe levels over 8 dS m-1 did not show any visual symptoms of salt stress. Elsewhere, 

Bochansev et al. (1955) highlighted that T.hispida, C.album and K.caspia have highest 

adaptation to grow in saline environments and can be considered as halophyte species. 

As it is known, high sodium concentration in the soil adversely affects to the development 

of plant roots. Moreover, high sodium can cause soil structure deterioration and water 

infiltration problems. Thus, sodium levels in soil were analyzed in our study to identify the 

specific soil problems and its severity using Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) equation 

(Richards, 1954). Here, sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ion 

concentrations are given in milliequivalent per liter (meq L-1): 

 

 

 
According to the results, SAR values for field 1 and field 2 averaged 1.1 and 3.35, 

respectively, within 45 cm soil surface (Annex 10). Meanwhile, high SAR values observed 

in the naturally grown fields. For instance, the highest 6.83 SAR was observed in 

Apocynum lancifolium soils, within 0-45 cm soil subsurface layers. Davis et al.  (2006) 

highlighted that if the SAR value is above 13, sodium can cause problems for plants and 

soils. In our experimental sites, the SAR values were below 13 and no significant sodium 

effect was observed.

Moreover, Richards (1954) proposed soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) using 

SAR to classify soils. The following equation was used to calculate ESP (%): 

 

 
 
The results showed that field 1 had lower ESP values than field 2 (Annex 10). However, as 

was the case in SAR, field 3 plants had the highest ESP. Average highest ESP 7.6 was 

observed in G.glabra field over the examined 45 cm soil profile. It should be stated that 

according to Richards (1954) soil classification, none of the investigated fields had 

significant sodic problems. 

 

IV.1.7 – Depth and Mineralization of Groundwater 

According to the results, the high groundwater table was observed in field 2 ranging 

between 56-61.5 cm within the soil pits (Annex 14), probably due to either inefficient 

drainage or drainage that is artificially blocked by farmers in order to raise either drainage 

water or the groundwater table to meet the crop water requirement. The farmers within the 

area of field 2 highlighted that the area sometimes faced irrigation water shortages and thus, 

groundwater resources is used as a source of moisture for crops. It should be pointed out 

that application of irrigation water could also have influenced to the increase of GWT in 

field 2. On the other hand, in spite of leaching activities in field 1 before the experiment, 

the groundwater table was far from the soil surface ranging between 108 and 115 cm within 

the soil pits. 

Meantime, the mean electrical conductivity of the groundwater was 11.2 dS m-1 for field 2 

and 6.2 dS m-1 for field 1. According to Rhoades et al. (1992), the groundwater of field 1

could be classified as moderate while field 2 as highly saline. The main reasons for high 

groundwater ECw in field 2 could have been: higher soil osmotic potential than matric 

pressure and improper drainage systems causing a rise in GWT. 

 

IV.2 - Experiments with Portulaca Oleracea Golden Purslane 

IV.2.1 – Crop Yield and Vegetative Growth 

Despite the fact that the field 2 was irrigated during the vegetation period, the biomass of 

P.oleracea at the harvest time was very low averaging from 411 to 489 kg ha-1 dry matter 

in August and September, respectively (Annexes 11a &amp;amp; 11b). It can be presumed that other 

factors significantly influenced the decrease of production of biomass at field 2. These 

could have been: higher degree of soil salinity, higher rate of upward water movement from 

a shallow water table and no plucking the weeds after the irrigation. Interestingly, with no 

irrigation of field 1, high biomass production of P.oleracea averaging from 3507 to 3948 

kg ha-1 DM was obtained. These results are confirmed by previous research implemented 

by the UzRICG (Kurambaev, 1969), which found that without irrigation the high crop (e.g. 

cotton) production can be obtained when the groundwater table (GWT) is at 1-1.2 m depth 

and only slightly saline. Moreover, before the experiment, field 1 was used as a pasture for 

cattle and sheep and the input of manure from these animals might have positively 

influenced to the higher production. On the other hand, field 2 was used to produce maize 

and fertilization was not done effectively. In addition, field 2 GWT was shallow, which 

caused anaerobic conditions and hampered the development of the P.oleracea root system. 

These aspects have already been studied in several crops, where the development was

adversely affected with a significant decrease in production due to shallow GWT (Torres &amp;amp; 

Hanks, 1989; Beltrao et al., 1996). 

In addition, a mean length of P.oleracea was 

measured in field 1 and 2 at harvest during 

the experiment to identify the vegetative 

growth (Fig. IV.5 &amp;amp; IV.6). At field 1, a 

mean length of P.oleracea averaged 

between 12.7–19.7 cm at harvest in August 

and September, respectively, whereas at 

field 2 it varied from 14.5 to 17.8 cm at the 

harvest time.  

Moreover, the roots of the plant varied from 5-10 cm in both experimental fields. It should 

be pointed out that the higher degree of soil salinity in field 2 did not greatly affect to the 

plant height.

IV.2.2 – Salt Accumulation 

The analysis revealed that P.oleracea tissues accumulated the largest amounts of chloride 

and magnesium in field 1 (Annex 12). Moreover, sodium and calcium concentrations were 

also relatively high in this field. The highest chloride ion concentration was accumulated by 

P.oleracea in field 1 and ranged between 64.16-75.63 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 71.10 mg 

g-1 DM in August harvest (Table IV.1). Furthermore, it was observed that the uptake of 

chloride (Cl
-
) by examined species in the September harvest was lower, and ranged 

between 64.70-72.73 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 69.4 mg g-1 DM. Meanwhile, the 

magnesium varied from 42.02-48.49 mg g-1 DM, and averaged 44.54 mg g-1 DM in August 

harvest. The magnesium concentration also decreased in the September harvest, and ranged 

between 35.05-42.02 mg g-1 DM and averaged 37.86 mg g-1 DM. The sodium and calcium 

concentrations varied between 9.54-8.19 mg g-1 DM and 12.9-11.1 mg g-1 DM over the 

examined period. In addition, Potassium showed considerably low accumulation varying 

from 3.7-2.83 mg g-1 DM at the harvested periods. The results also showed the slight 

decrease of some ions in the month of September. 

Interestingly, at field 2, P.oleracea tissues accumulated largest amounts of chloride and 

sodium while magnesium and calcium concentrations were rather low. For instance, 

sodium ranged between 18.65-31.51 mg g-1 DM and averaged 26.40 mg g-1 DM in the 

August harvest, while the September harvest showed slight decreases in sodium uptake, 

ranging between 18.08-33.09 and averaging 24.85 mg g-1 DM. Furthermore, chloride 

accumulation averaged from 59.9 to 56.7 mg g-1 DM in August and September, 

respectively. In addition, higher accumulation of Cl
-
 and Na+ in the tissues of P.oleracea 

plants in moderately saline soil can mean this plant is a relatively a salt removal plant since

soils contain mainly NaCl. As was the case in field 1, the potassium concentration in field 2 

was low varying from 3.1 to 2.5 mg g-1 DM in August and September, accordingly. 

Table IV.1 – Chloride Content (mg g-1 DM) in the Tissues of P.oleracea in Khorezm 
Region. Values are Means and Standard Deviations of Three Treatments 

 
In many cases of our results, August period extracted higher amounts of ions than 

September due to several factors: 1) plant transpiration and soil evaporation are higher in 

August because of higher radiation (temperature and light); 2) air relative humidity is 

higher in September. 

In addition, the extraction of total soluble salts by P.oleracea was similar in both fields 

(Fig. IV.7). As can be seen from Fig. IV.7, on average, the plant can extract from 141.8 to 

129.4 mg g-1 DM in field 1 over the examined period. In field 2, it averaged between 120.5-

113.8 mg g-1 DM in August and September, correspondingly.

Fig. IV.9 (a) - P.oleracea at Field 1 Fig. IV.9 (b) - P.oleracea at Field 2

Despite low soil salinity levels in field 1, the higher salt uptake, on average, 496.7 kg ha-1 

was obtained in August, while 511.3 kg ha-1 in September (Fig. IV.8). As shown in Fig.  

IV.8, average salt accumulation of P.oleracea in field 2, in terms of kilogram per hectare, 

was decreased drastically ranging between 49.6-55.5 kg ha-1 during the examined period, 

most probably due to low biomass production. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
This evergreen P.oleracea species showed to be relatively tolerant to saline conditions and 

can be planted as ornamentals without irrigation. Furthermore, due to higher capillary rise 

of groundwater and the lack of plucking weeds after irrigation, field 2 had produced lower 

amounts of dry matter. Furthermore, as stated earlier, field 1 produced higher plant density 

than field 2, because field 2 was sparsely populated compared to field 1 (Fig. IV.9 a, b).

Meanwhile, our analysis showed that P.oleracea accumulated 16.81 % of the total soil 

salts. It should be pointed out that P.oleracea can remove the salts only from 5-10 cm of 

soil surface because of its root length (Table IV.2). Due to low plant density and high soil 

salinity, the extraction of salts from the soil was much lower in field 2.

IV.3 - Experiments with Native Wild Species 

IV.3.1 – Crop Yield and Vegetative Growth 

According to the results of experiment, C.album had the highest biomass production 

amongst native wild species ranging between 2689-3243 kg ha-1 DM in August and 

September, respectively (Annex 11a and 11b). Moreover, T.hispida had produced slightly 

lower biomass production than C.album with the potential yield of 1889-2062 kg ha-1 DM. 

The less efficient crops, in terms of yield productions, were native P.oleracea, 

A.lancifolium, K.caspia, G.glabra and A.pseudalhagi. In addition, the data showed a yield 

reduction in September harvest as comparing to August for native P.oleracea and G.glabra, 

probably due to climatic parameters such as low light intensity and low air temperature 

during September. Previous results show (Khamidov et al., 2005) that the experimental 

region is often leached in the end of vegetation period, i.e. in the autumn, because of higher 

soil salinity in that period. Thus, lower biomass production could have been obtained in the 

autumn season.

The analysis of the plant height data showed that C.album height reached a mean value of 

65 cm in the August harvest but was as high as 82 cm in the September harvest (Annex 13). 

However, a mean highest value was obtained for A.lancifolium varying from 95 to 85 cm at 

harvest. In general, the plant height was not greatly affected by the soil salinity even with 

the highest salt concentration level of 13 dS m-1. This indicates that the plant height is not 

extensively influenced by salinity of soil or GWT. However, greater improvement of the 

plant height could be attained under either irrigation or/and fertilization. 

IV.3.2 – Salt Accumulation 

T.hispida, K.caspia and C.album were found to be the most effective in removing chloride 

ions from the soil in naturally grown wild species field (Table IV.3). The following 

efficient species were native P.oleracea, A.pseudalhagi, G.glabra and A.lancifolium. 

Furthermore, the analysis revealed that sodium concentration were relatively high for 

T.hispida, C.album and K.caspia plant species ranging between 32.53, 38.74 and 40.09 mg 

g-1 DM in the August period (Annex 12). However, in the September period there showed a 

slight decrease 25.87, 33.66 and 26.43 mg g-1 DM, respectively for the above-mentioned 

species. P.oleracea green purslane, C.album and K.caspia showed higher values in 

accumulation magnesium content. Since the organic matters of the soils in the investigated 

area are relatively low, the potassium concentrations in the plant tissues were also low.

In addition, capacity of the wild plants to remove salts from the soil is shown in Fig. IV.10. 

It is clear from the figure that three species C.album, K.caspia and T.hispida have high 

potential to accumulate soluble salts. Native P.oleracea and A.pseudalhagi showed 

relatively low removal of salts from the soil. It is interesting to note that A.lancifolium was 

developed in high saline soils but had removed very low amount of salts, and thus can be 

considered as a salt-tolerant but not a salt removal species.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The most efficient wild plant in removing salts from the soil was C.album which removed 

between 538.4-569.6 kg ha-1 in August and September, respectively (Fig.  IV.11). 

Furthermore, T.hispida and K.caspia accumulated between 330.8-370.9 kg ha-1 and 271.5-

275.5 kg ha-1 during August and September periods. The least efficient native wild species 

were identified as A.pseudalhagi, G.glabra and A.lancifolium where they removed less than 

150 kg ha-1. Meanwhile, P.oleracea green purslane showed slight lower ion accumulation 

ranging between 204.4-200.8 kg ha-1 during August and September periods.

In addition, C.album showed the highest accumulation of salts (1.45 %) from the soil on the 

percentage basis. Because its root depth is about 25-30 cm, it can only remove the salts 

within that profile (Table IV.4). Followed efficient species were K.caspia, T.hispida, 

G.glabra and A.lancifolium.

V – CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

In arid areas, drought and salinity are the key factors that responsible for limiting crop 

productivity. Uzbekistan’s Khorezm region is a semi-arid area which is badly affected by 

soil salinity of which the main causes are the mismanagement of water and land resources 

over the past forty years as well as poor drainage infrastructures. As long as these problems 

continue to intensify, the health and livelihood of the population of the region will be 

threatened and the land and water resources irreversibly affected. 

Conventional techniques, namely leaching and use of enhancing fertilization have been 

used to mitigate soil salinity and to increase the salt tolerance of agricultural crops. 

However, the intense use of these conventional techniques has also attracted public 

attention due to environmental pollution and contamination of groundwater resources. The 

phytoremediation technique has become an efficient method to cope with soil salinity in 

developed countries. More recently, this method has been applied to the northern region of 

Uzbekistan with the hope of remediating saline soils and helping to maintain the 

sustainability of agricultural lands. Moreover, as cotton is the dominant crop in the 

Khorezm region and low yields of cotton are mostly caused by salinity, the introduction of 

salt removing species could potentially create both environmental and economic solutions, 

provided that they can be used as vegetables, ornamentals or fodder, and could also be 

integrated into cultivation/rotation programmes to remediate temporarily saline soils. 

The findings from eight investigated species indicated that annual Portulaca oleracea 

golden purslane is the most potential salt (ion) removal species in the Khorezm region of 

Uzbekistan. In general, the ideal multipurpose plant species should have a combination of 

the following features: ability to remove high levels of ions from the soil; high biomass

production potential; a short vegetation period; low water consumption; good acceptance 

by local consumers as a leafy vegetable; tolerance to drought and hot conditions; and easy 

crop management. Taking into consideration all these parameters of the ideal multi-purpose 

plant species and the results of the field experiments, the P.oleracea golden purslane has 

the highest potential to mature in salt-affected soils, to remove high levels of salts from the 

soil and to develop on both loamy and sandy soils, which represent the dominant soil 

textures in the region. 

However, in the experimental area in field 2, high capillary water rise from a shallow 

groundwater table significantly contributed to soil moisture conditions and to the biomass 

production of the P.oleracea. Many scientists have pointed out that capillary rise may have 

a negative effect on yield, when the groundwater table is about 0.6 m from soil surface. 

This research proved that due to a shallow groundwater table (~ 0.6) and applied irrigation 

water in field 2, the plant density and biomass production was significantly low. 

On the other hand, no irrigation was required for obtaining the highest biomass production 

in field 1 when the water table remained at a depth of about 1.1 m, and slightly saline, 

during the cropping season. It can be concluded that upward flow from shallow water is a 

significant component in the irrigation water balance of crops as well as optimization of 

crop productivity.  

Furthermore, the analysis showed that among the native wild plants, grown on the salinized  

soils, Chenopodium album, Tamarix hispida and Karelinia caspia accumulated the highest 

ion concentrations and can be widely cultivated in the Khorezm region to remediate saline 

soils. Furthermore, native plants have the advantage of being highly adapted to the local 

climatic and edaphic contaminated conditions. 



Conclusions and Recommendations 

 63 
 

However, a major negative aspect of annual P.oleracea was its root profile because it can 

only remove ions within 15 cm of the soil surface. On the other hand, the findings from 

native plants revealed that perennial C.album, K.caspia, T.hispida, G.glabra and 

A.lancifolium species were able to remove less salts but from much deeper layers - up to 50 

cm. 

Previous investigations in the Mediterranean area have shown that annual Tetragonia 

tetragonioides and perennial Atriplex prostrata crops produced the highest biomass and 

were efficient crops to remove ions from salt-affected soils. For instance, Beltrao et al. 

(2006) found that Tetragonia tetragonioides produced 4200 kg ha-1 DM and removed up to 

700 kg ha-1 NaCl in Portugal, whereas Cuartero et al. (2002) successfully tested Atriplex 

prostrata in Spain, which produced a biomass of 14 tons ha-1 DM and removed about 2 

tons ha-1 ions. In this study, Portulaca oleracea produced about 3950 kg ha-1 DM and 

removed about 500 kg ha-1 ions. Therefore, in future investigations, we need to assess other 

crops, such as Tetragonia tetragonioides and Atriplex prostrata for their efficiencies to 

remove ions from the saline soils. 

Nevertheless, the phytoremediation technique is not the sole method to prevent soil salinity 

and to optimize crop productivity. Economically, soil leaching and combined effects of 

fertilizers and salts have been an efficient method to control salinity because they are easier 

and cheaper than phytoremediation. In the leaching process, ions move from upper layers to 

deeper layers and may reach the aquifers, which is a negative environmental consequence.  

The plants can be produced but this has a negative impact on deeper soil layers and 

aquifers. The phytoremediation technique is an environmentally cleaner and safer method 

but is not always economically feasible. Thus, the best way to remediate soil salinity in the 

agricultural areas of Khorezm Region and to maintain the natural environment in good

condition is to combine both conventional and phytoremediation techniques in order to 

achieve economic, environmental and social sustainability. However, additional research is 

needed and encouraged on these topics, in particular, how to develop the phytoremediation 

method into more a economically feasible technique for the remediation of saline soils.

Linear Regression 
 
A crop production system is characterized by the link between the production and the 
factors involved in it. Mathematically it is given by: 
 

Y = F(Xi) = F (X1, X2, …….Xn) 
 
where: Y is the dry matter crop production (kg ha-1) and Xi is the factor (mg g-1) affecting it 
(i.e. Cl

-
, Mg

2+
, etc). The findings of the regression output are provided below.
