RESUMO 

Actualmente assiste-se a uma crescente exigência dos consumidores relativamente à 

qualidade dos papéis de impressão e escrita (P&amp;amp;W), especialmente no que respeita à sua 

imprimabilidade. As interacções tinta-papel são afectadas quer pelas propriedades físico-

químicas da superfície do papel quer pelas propriedades da matriz fibrosa, pelo que não 

apenas o tratamento final da superfície mas, em geral, todas as operações do processo de 

produção condicionam o desempenho do papel em termos de impressão. Neste contexto, a 

modificação química da superfície do papel é hoje em dia uma prática comum para 

aumentar a qualidade de impressão, sendo a colagem superficial uma operação corrente 

em qualquer fábrica de papel.  

Tradicionalmente, é utilizada uma solução de amido para o tratamento superficial de 

papéis de impressão e escrita, a fim de melhorar propriedades como a resistência 

superficial ou imprimabilidade. No entanto, recentemente têm vindo a ser usadas 

formulações de colagem superficial à base de misturas de amido catiónico com pequenas 

percentagens de copolímeros sintéticos, de modo a realçar os efeitos da colagem 

superficial, particularmente no que diz respeito à energia de superfície, carácter hidrofílico 

e afinidade para com diferentes tipos de tinta. O objectivo principal é o de optimizar os 

processos de absorção e espalhamento das tintas de impressão, e assim favorecer a 

qualidade de impressão. 

O principal objectivo do presente trabalho é precisamente analisar o impacto da aplicação 

de diferentes formulações de colagem superficial, constituídas por misturas de amido e um 

agente de colagem, tanto nas propriedades superficiais do papel como na qualidade de 

impressão. Para tal foram utilizadas misturas de amido catiónico com 10 copolímeros 

distintos, em três percentagens diferentes de copolímero (5%, 10% e 20% w/w), num total 

de 30 formulações. Estas formulações foram devidamente caracterizadas e depois 

aplicadas na superfície de folhas de papel não revestido produzido com base em pasta 

kraft branqueada de E. globulus e procedeu-se à análise exaustiva das respectivas 

superfícies, designadamente em termos de lisura, porosidade e algumas propriedades 

químicas, como a energia de superfície e o carácter ácido-base da superfície. O papel 

tratado com 100% de amido catiónico foi tomado como amostra de referência. Foram 

utilizadas diversas técnicas de caracterização, como perfilometria óptica, porosimetria de 

mercúrio, medição dos ângulos de contacto e cromatografia gasosa de fase inversa (IGC). 



 

 x 

Complementarmente, usou-se ainda Microscopia de Força Atómica, Espectroscopia 

Electrónica para Análise Química e Espectroscopia de Ião Secundário, a fim de esclarecer 

aspectos mais específicos em algumas das amostras. Por fim, procedeu-se à avaliação da 

qualidade de impressão inkjet nas diferentes amostras, através quer da determinação de 

vários parâmetros de qualidade de impressão quer da análise das amostras impressas por 

um painel de utilizadores finais deste tipo de papéis. Estes resultados foram correlacionados 

com os provenientes da caracterização da superfície do papel, recorrendo a PLS (Partial 

Least Squares). Todos os resultados experimentais foram sujeitos a uma análise de variância 

(ANOVA) e análise de componentes principais (PCA - Principal Component Analysis) por 

forma a avaliar a variabilidade intra e inter-amostras. Esta variabilidade foi analisada de 

modo sistemático tendo em conta os tratamentos de superfície aplicados. 

O estudo desenvolvido revelou que os tratamentos de colagem na superfície do papel têm 

um impacto pouco significativo em parâmetros físicos, como os determinados por 

perfilometria ou por porosimetria de mercúrio, mas influenciam decisivamente as 

propriedades químicas da superfície das amostras. Com efeito, as diferentes formulações 

testadas conduziram a níveis de energia de superfície e de carácter ácido-base, avaliados 

pela medição dos ângulos de contacto e por IGC, significativamente diferentes. Estas 

diferenças permitiram detectar e interpretar os efeitos quer da natureza quer da 

quantidade de copolímero incorporado nas formulações, conduzindo ainda a uma melhor 

compreensão das interacções de natureza físico-química que ocorrem à superfície do papel 

quando este é sujeito a tratamentos de colagem superficial para optimização do processo 

de impressão inkjet. 

Por último, é de sublinhar que os resultados obtidos neste trabalho se revestem do maior 

interesse para a indústria papeleira nacional, na medida em envolvem o seu mais 

importante produto – os papéis não revestidos para impressão e escrita –, para o qual não 

há estudos sistemáticos publicados com as formulações testadas. Além disso, a selecção das 

formulações e dos copolímeros teve em conta a viabilidade da sua aplicação industrial.

ABSTRACT 

The consumer’s demand for quality in printing and writing paper grades (P&amp;amp;W) is increasing, 

especially in what concerns printability. 

Paper-ink interactions are strongly dependent on the structural and chemical properties of 

the paper surface. These properties are the result not only of specific surface treatments but 

also of the properties of the fibrous matrix, namely the quality of the pulp fibers. Therefore 

final printing quality performance of the paper is influenced, in general, by all the 

operations in the papermaking process. For this reason the chemical modification of the 

paper surface in order to improve printing quality is nowadays a common practice in 

papermaking, and surface sizing is a standard operation in many paper mills. 

Typically – and especially for P&amp;amp;W papers - starch is used for surface sizing, with the main 

goal of improving paper surface resistance and printability. However, there is an increasing 

tendency to use blends of cationic starch and synthetic copolymers to enhance surface sizing 

effects by controlling the paper surface energy, the corresponding hydrophilic character and 

the affinity towards different types of ink. The main objective of this approach is to improve 

print quality by optimizing the balance between the absorption and spreading phenomena.  

This work targets the analysis of the impact of the application of different surface sizing 

formulations, composed of blends of cationic starch and minor quantities of distinct 

copolymers, in the chemical and physical surface characteristics of the modified paper 

samples and in the final printing quality. Ten distinct copolymers were blended with cationic 

starch in three different percentages of copolymer (5%, 10% and 20% w/w), resulting in a 

total of 30 different formulations. These formulations were characterized and applied to the 

surface of an E. globulus bleached kraft pulp based uncoated paper, and the corresponding 

paper surfaces were fully characterized with respect to some structural properties, namely 

roughness and porosity, as well as some chemical properties, namely surface energy and 

acid-base character. A sample surface sized only with cationic starch was taken as 

reference. Several characterization techniques were used, namely laser profilometry, 

mercury porosimetry, contact angle measurements and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). 

Selected samples were additionally analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy, Electron 

Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, in 

order to clarify specific aspects. Finally, the influence of the different sizing agents on the 

printing quality of the samples was investigated by quantifying several parameters in a 



 

 xii 

specific inkjet printed mask and also by using the results of an evaluating panel composed of 

several end users of this type of papers. 

The results from the printing tests were correlated to those obtained from the 

characterization of the paper surfaces by using Partial Least Squares. All the data were 

submitted to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in 

order to evaluate inter and intra-samples variability.  This variability was thoroughly 

analyzed and interpreted in terms of the corresponding surface treatments. 

The results revealed that the surface sizing treatments used in this study have a minor impact 

on the surface roughness and porosity, but a substantial influence on surface energetics. In 

fact, relevant differences were detected in the surface energy and acid-base character of 

the sized samples, as measured by contact angle and IGC.  These differences enabled the 

interpretation of the influence of the nature and quantity of the copolymers used in the sizing 

formulations and simultaneously a better understanding of the physical and chemical 

interactions that occur at paper surface when it is subjected to a sizing treatment in order to 

optimize the inkjet printing process. 

Finally, it should be pointed out that the results are of the utmost importance to the national 

paper industry as they relate to its most relevant product – the eucalyptus based printing 

and writing uncoated papers – for which there are no published results involving the tested 

formulations. Furthermore, both the copolymers and the formulations used were selected 

having in mind the feasibility of their application in the paper industry.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Paper has played a vital role in the cultural development of mankind, being used mainly for 

writing, printing, and packaging. It plays a key role in communication; printed communication 

is almost synonymous with paper. Papermaking is a vast, multidisciplinary technology that has 

expanded tremendously in recent years. Significant advances have been made in all areas 

of papermaking, including raw materials, production technology, process control and end 

products. The complexity of the processes, the scale of operation, and production speeds 

leave little room for error or malfunction. Modern papermaking would not be possible 

without a proper command of a great variety of technologies. Along the years not only has 

the technology progressed and new technology emerged, but also the understanding of the 

fundamentals of unit processes, raw materials and product properties have also deepened 

considerably. Paper products are complex in structure and contain many different 

components. The requirements placed on the way these products perform are wide, varied 

and often conflicting. Product development and improvements is thus a constant need and 

requires a profound understanding of the chemistry and physics of both raw materials and 

product structures (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 

2000) 

 

1.1 HISTORY 

Following the evolution of the human intelligence, the graphical representations became 

increasingly complex, and together with an increase in the ability to create tools, took to the 

development of more adequate supports. The history tells about the use of boards, cooked 

clay, tissues of various fibers, papyrus, parchment and finally paper (Oittinen and Saarelma 

1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000). 

Clay seems to have been the first material used explicitly for writing, by Sumerians, 6 

millennia B.C.. The manuscripts on dry palm leaves appeared after the invention of the 

alphabet, and they were used mainly in India and Southeast Asia until the 19th century. In 

Greece appeared the waxed boards, which the Romans have also adopted. About 3 

thousand years B.C. it was found out the possibility of the adaptation for writing of thick stem 

plants, which grew in the margins of the Nile River and were called “Papyrus”. Many years 

after, the Romans improved the papyrus quality, by pasting the fibers to each other with

starch glues. Papyrus was in fact the main mean for writing communication until the 8th 

century. (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000). 

The primacy of paper production is assigned to Ts'ai Lun of china in the year 105 After 

Christ, who made paper of fishing nets and rags pulp, and later using vegetable fibers. In 

Europe, paper was first manufactured in Spain and Sicily, and gradually its use spread 

northward (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  

When the paper demand rapidly increased in the eighteenth century, papermakers in 

Continental Europe came up with the idea of developing a machine for forming the paper.  

Nicolas-Louis Robert (1761-1828) has gone down in history as the inventor of a continuously 

moving belt of wire cloth on which the fiber suspension was spread and the water was 

allowed to drain away, leaving an endless sheet of paper on the wire. The first trials were 

made as early as 1793, but only in 1798 a construction on which a continuous web of paper 

could be made. The wooden machine was 260 cm long, and the width of the paper was 64 

centimeters (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  

In 1807, a patent for a machine with the essential features of the "fourdrinier" machine we 

know today was procured in the names of the Fourdrinier brothers (Henry and Sealy) and 

John Gamble (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  

In the 1820s in England, machine-produced paper surpassed in quantity the hand-paper 

production. Around 1840, there were about 250 paper machines in operation in England, 

125 in France, and 50 in Germany, the majority of which were of English origin (Lehtinen 

2000; Paulapuro 2000). 

Along the years many individuals and companies obtained patents on the basic components 

in the process. Improvements at each stage of the papermaking process have contributed to 

the exceptional speed, runnability, and reliability of today's paper machines. Figure 1.1 shows 

the exponential increase in maximum operating speeds of paper machines (Lehtinen 2000; 

Paulapuro 2000).

Papers can be graded in several ways, some of the main criteria used to classify papers 

include basis weight, fiber furnish, type of surface finish or end use, as depicted in Table 1.1 

(Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; URL 4 2009).

1.2 PAPER PRODUCTION 

Paper is obtained by a mixture of fibers, typically from vegetal origin composed by 

cellulose, which are kept together by hydrogen bridges. The most common source of natural 

fibers is the pulp obtained from the wood of threes. Vegetal fibers such as cotton, hemp, flax 

and rice can also be used. Usually, and regarding printing and writing (P&amp;amp;W) papers in 

particular, composition also includes filler and additives (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; 

Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  

The papermaking process contains a great number of different unit processes, which work 

through different mechanisms to produce the desired effects on the fiber suspension, and 

subsequently, on the fibrous web. It starts with slushing of fibers and other raw materials in 

water, continues through paper machine and finishing operations and ends with packaging of 

the paper. The papermaking process is essentially a very large drainage operation. Figure 

7.12 presents the main sections of a paper mill, which comprise the stock preparation, paper 

machine and finishing and the typical layout of a P&amp;amp;W paper machine. 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.2 – Schematic representation of the production process for printing and writing papers. 

 

Consistency of the stock flow entering the paper machine forming section is typically between 

0.2% and 1.0% (2 - 10 g fiber per kg water). After drainage on the wire of the forming 

section using gravitation, pulsation, or vacuum, the web consistency increases to 15% - 25%. 

Mechanical compression removes water on the press section. The web consistency (now called 

dry solids content) then increases to 33% - 55% depending on the paper grade and press 

section design. After the press section, the web enters the pre-dryer section where 

evaporation, removes the remaining water. However, a small amount of moisture (2% - 5%)

remains in the paper before the surface sizing operation, after which the paper web enters 

in the after-drying section, to achieve the final moisture content typically between 5% and 

7% (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  

 

Although the principles of paper manufacturing are similar to the ones developed many 

centuries ago, significant advances have been made in all areas of papermaking, including 

raw materials, production technology, process control and end products. As mentioned in the 

very beginning of this work, at the present time, the complexity of the processes, the scale of 

operation, and the production speeds leave little room for error or malfunction. Paper must 

maintain its competitiveness through continuous product development in order to meet the 

ever-increasing demands on its performance. This framework is the main driving force for 

many studies on paper, with a great focus on paper surface in the most recent years, mainly 

due to the increasing importance given to paper ink interactions, which are mainly ruled by 

the paper surface properties (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 

2000). 

 

1.3 PAPER SURFACE TREATMENTS 

Currently, paper surface has been the subject of many attentions, since it is one of the crucial 

factors affecting the final performance of the paper. Paper surface treatments are thus 

increasingly used in every paper mill to control and improve the surface properties of its 

product. These surface treatments may be physical (calendering) or chemical (surface sizing 

or coating) (Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000).  

In the production of P&amp;amp;W papers, the physical treatment of the surface by calendering and 

the chemical treatment by surface sizing are generally always used. Coating is a chemical 

surface treatment rarely applied for this type of papers; it is currently used for many other 

paper grades such as magazine paper of photographic paper (Lehtinen 2000). 

Calendering consists in submitting the paper to pressure, by passing it between rolling 

cylinders. The main target of calendering is to modify the surface structure and/or the sheet 

thickness. In the case of printing, the main calendering targets are to reduce surface 

roughness and compress the pore structure to obtain a good printing result. Two different 

options can be used for calendering: hard rolls, made from cast iron or soft rolls, with 

polymer coverage. The latter distribute the calendering pressure more evenly creating a

 Isabel M. T. Moutinho 8 

more uniform surface finish and are currently the option preferably used in the industry 

(Oittinen and Saarelma 1998). 

Regarding the chemical treatment, it should be mentioned that the main difference between 

coating and surface sizing is that the former involves pigments in the solution that is applied 

to the paper surface, in concentrations that are in general larger than 3.5 g/m2. Pigments 

such as clay, talc, and calcium carbonate are often used to produce the coating formulations 

in order to further enhance the printability of fibrous sheets (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998) 

(Donigian et al. 1997; Nissi et al. 1999; Lohmander and Rigdahl 2000; Ahlroos and grön 

2001; Fardim 2002; Conceição et el. 2003; Forsström et al. 2003; Ridgway and Gane 

2003; Garcia 2004; Putkisto et al. 2004; Engström 2005). 

Surface sizing is the subject this work and will be detailed in the following section. 

 

1.3.1 SURFACE SIZING 

Surface sizing is a common operation in any paper mill of P&amp;amp;W papers. It consists in the 

application of an aqueous suspension composed of several functional chemicals at the 

surface of the paper, mainly to improve surface resistance, increase paper stiffness and 

improve paper printability. 

There are two types of formulations that can be used in surface sizing: starch alone or starch 

combined with a synthetic surface sizing agent. The most common option in the industry is to 

perform surface sizing by using starch alone (usually modified starch - cationic), however 

there is an increasing tendency, already applied in several paper mills, to combine the 

cationic starch with some synthetic surface sizing agents (Browning 1977; Bauer et al. 1999; 

Sequera 1999; Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000; Lee et al. 2002; Carceller and Juppo2004; 

Andersson et al. 2006; Prinz and Schultz 2007). 

When both starch and synthetic surface sizing agents are used, the most important function of 

the starch is to act as a binder, in order to produce an even blend. As for the synthetic 

surface sizing agents, their use is often necessary because the primary raw material of 

paper and paperboard is the hydrophilic component cellulose. As these synthetic surface 

sizing agents are usually polymers with some degree of hydrophobicity, the paper surface 

becomes water resistant, which is crucial for many printing processes (Oittinen and Saarelma 

1998; Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000; Glittenberg and Leonhardt 2007).  



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 9 

It should be pointed out that besides starch (usually cationic) and, in some cases, the synthetic 

surface sizing agents, the sizing formulations include additional compounds, such as salt, 

optical brightener agents (OBA) and defoaming agents. 

 

Starch is a natural polymer consisting of glucose monomers. It is the second most abundant 

biologically produced organic material after cellulose. Chemically, the starch polymer is 

much like cellulose. The difference lies in the structure which gives these two materials 

different properties, as illustrated in Figure 1.3 (Bauer et al. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.3 - Structure of starch and cellulose. 

 

As indicated in Figure 1.3, the difference relies in the way glucose monomers are bonded. The 

bonds between glucose units are called glycosidic bonds, and their orientation is different in 

cellulose and starch. In starch, all glycosidic bonds are oriented in the same direction 

whereas, in cellulose, the orientation of two consecutive bonds is opposite. This is the reason 

for cellulose being a straight polymer while starch is coiled. Cellulose forms fibers, which are 

partly crystalline, while starch is totally amorphous and forms granules with different shapes 

and sizes depending on which plant they come from (corn, wheat, potato, and tapioca are 

common sources) (Bauer et al. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). 

In the paper industry, the starch is previously cooked by steam. During the cooking process, 

the starch granules start to swell, at 40°C - 50°C, and after that, the starch polymers start to

dissolve. Starch has binding properties only in the dissolved form (seeFigure 1.4) (Bauer et 

al. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.4 - Starch during cooking. 

 

Cooked native starch tends to be very viscous and forms gels at very low dry solids. This 

behavior is called retrogradation because the starch polymers strive to rebind to each other 

and to form irreversible gels. Thus, starch for surface sizing is usually modified to ensure its 

good functionality, by improving and/or controlling its binding power, rheology, viscosity-

temperature stability, and tendency to degradation. In the particular case of the starch 

modified for application in surface sizing, the most important modification that it is submitted 

is cationization, making it positively charged, bi the addition of H+ functional groups, in order 

to increase the affinity for the anionic surface of the cellulose fibers (Bauer et al. 1999; 

Lehtinen 2000; Glittenberg and Leonhardt 2007).  

The synthetic surface sizing agents are usually polymeric compounds, totally or partially 

hydrophobic. Typically the chemical bases used to produce synthetic surface sizing agents 

are styrene, maleic anhydride, acrylic acid, ester or polyurethanes (Brandão 1999; Exner 

2001; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Prinz and Schultz 2007). 

When combined with starch, a thin reticular film is formed at the paper surface, as depicted 

in Figure 1.5. This film influences several paper properties such as smoothness, surface 

resistance, surface free energy and hydrophobicity.

In terms of industrial application of surface sizing, a revolutionary change over the years has 

undergone in terms of equipments. Until the beginning of the 1980’s, the pond size press 

technology was the most used. In this system, the paper passes through a pond with the sizing 

blend and after, between two cylinders, as depicted in Figure 1.6 (Lehtinen 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.6 – Schematic representation of a pond size press. 

 

This main advantage of this technology presented is the penetration depth of the sizing 

blend, giving z-directional strength to the paper. However, it limited paper machine speeds 

to approximately 1000 m/min. The main breakthrough in surface sizing technology, 

introduced in the 1980’s, was the appearance of the film size press technology. In this 

method, the sizing blend is applied in the rolls, in the desired amount, and not directly onto 

the paper. The paper is passed through those rolls to allow the transfer of the blend, as 

depicted in Figure 1.7 (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000).

Figure 1.7 – Schematic representation of a film size press. 

 

One of the main advantages of the film press technology is the metering elements that allow 

uniform films to be formed on the transfer roll surface. During the last years, film presses 

were the technology selected for the new woodfree paper machines installed and at the 

same time, most pond size presses on larger machines have been converted into film presses. 

The introduction of the film press technique has improved surface properties, such as dusting 

of the paper surface, due to reduced sizing penetration (Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000).  

Regardless the technology used, the surface sizing operation is affected by the sizing 

formulation properties (composition, viscosity, pH, temperature) as well as the base paper 

properties (basis weight, bulk, internal sizing, water content and surface energy, porosity 

and roughness). Thus, these properties must be adequately controlled, mainly in order to 

control the penetration of the surface sizing blend in the sheet structure. 

 

Currently, this is an area of the papermaking process where many attention has been 

focused, due to the increasing importance attributed to the surface properties of the paper. 

Thus, this is a research area under high development and many related studies have been 

published in the open literature (Borch 1982; Aspler et al. 1987; Aspler et al. 1993; Mangin 

1993; Lee et al. 2002; Ajerschi et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; Laleg 2004; 

Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Mešic et al. 2004; Andersson et al. 2006; Glittenberg and 

Leonhardt 2007; Gu et al. 2007; Moutinho et al. 2007b; Olkkonen and Lipponen2007; 

Prinz and Schultz 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ashori et al. 2008; Moutinho et al. 2008a).

1.4 CHARACTERIZATION OF PAPER SURFACE 

The evaluation of the effect of any surface modification requires a deep knowledge of the 

paper surface characteristics. Surface characterization can be undertaken either from the 

physical or the chemical point of view, and many techniques have been used for that 

purpose. 

Physical characterization of the paper surface is a more explored subject, since it is long 

established that properties such as porosity or roughness decisively influence paper 

performance. Thus profilometry (Gadelmawla et al. 2002; Wågberg and Johansson 2002; 

Barros 2004; Ashori et al. 2008; TrueGage 2008), mercury porosimetry (Knauf and Doshi 

1986; Johnson et al. 1999; Moura et al. 2005), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Chinga 

and Helle 2002b), Confocal microscopy (Conners and Banerjee 1995), and more recently, 

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Chhabra et al. 2005; Das et al. 2006), are now currently 

used to investigate the characterize paper. 

Regarding the surface chemical properties, modern and sophisticated techniques have been 

implemented (or adapted) for the  chemical characterization of paper sheets, namely contact 

angle measurements (Roe et al. 1967; Brigs et al. 1989; Marmur 2006), Fourier Transform 

Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Liu et al1998; Ernstsson 2005; Fardim and Durán 2005), 

Electronic Spectroscopy for Chemical analysis (ESCA/XPS) (Brinen 1993; Belgacem et al. 

1995; Kangas and Kleen2004), Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) (Gutierrez et al. 1999; 

Kunaver et al. 2004; Wang and Sain 2007), Time of Flight – Second Ion Mass Spectroscopy 

(ToF-SIMS) (Kleen et al. 2003; Koljonen 2004; Lee et al. 2006) and Raman Spectroscopy 

(Vyörykkä 2005). Most of these techniques were used in the present work, although some of 

them were only applied in some specific studies an on a few samples, in order to complement 

this study. In both cases the main objective is to provide information about paper surface that 

enables a better knowledge of the surface performance, in particular the paper-ink 

interactions, most relevant for P&amp;amp;W papers. The basic principle of the techniques used for 

the majority of the samples will be described in later chapters together with the 

corresponding results.  

 

1.5 PRINTING 

Paper is definitely the most important raw material in printing. The techniques and 

procedures used to produce printed products have evolved tremendously specially over the 



  Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps

last century, as summarized in Table 1.2. The Chinese invented the oldest known printing 

method, letterpress, in the year 700. Since then, many and revolutionary steps have been 

given, especially in the 20th century, from flexography, gravure, and offset to the modern 

digital printing and techniques (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000).

The traditional methods are usually called mechanical printing, in order to expresses the fact 

that the energy for image formation in the printing step is pressure. The term “mechanical” 

distinguishes conventional printing methods from electronic or digital printing methods, which 

are based on computer output. 

Mechanical printing uses the rotary principle in which printing ink transfers to the paper in a 

nip between two rotating cylinders. The imaging steps during mechanical printing procedures 

include transfer of the ink to a plate, ink transfer from the plate to the paper, and ink drying 

(Oittinen and Saarelma 1998). Figure 1.8, Figure 1.9 and Figure 1.10 describe the basic 

principles of flexography, rotogravure and offset printing, respectively.

The term digital printing refers to printing methods where the page data is input directly 

from a computer system to the printing device, without intermediate steps, and the printed 

information can be varied from sheet to sheet (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998). 

In digital printing methods, such as laser or inkjet printing there is no physical contact 

between the printing device and the paper. Laser printing, uses a laser to expose the non-

image areas of a charger photoconductive drum,  and the image areas, which remain 

charged, pick up a thin layer of oppositely charged toner particles. The drum then transfers 

the toner particles to the paper. In Inkjet printing by directing individual drops to a paper 

surface an image is created (Keskitalo 2000). Because of its ability to print on a variety of 

substrates, inkjet technology is also increasingly used in industrial printing and in the package 

printing industry (Svanholm 2004). And thus, due to its current and increasing importance in 

the printing market related to the paper type under study in this work, inkjet printing was the

method selected to perform printing quality evaluation in this work, and thus it will be further 

developed in Chapter 8. 

 

1.5.1 PRINTING QUALITY 

Regardless the printing method involved and the purpose of the printed material, printing 

quality evaluation is always done, as a control tool or at least by the final user of the printed 

material. Print quality definition does not have absolute terms it depends on interactions 

between paper and printing ink and the printing process variables (Oittinen and Saarelma 

1998; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000).  

The performance of paper in printing depends on its runnability and printability. Runnability 

relates to the factors that determine how the paper runs in the press. Printability factors 

concern to quality of paper in relation to ink and printing (Oittinen and Saarelma, 1998). 

Thus, the final performance of a paper, in terms of printing quality achieved depends on the 

properties of the fibrous matrix and on the characteristics of the paper surface, which are 

influenced by the quality of the pulp fibers, the refining process, the chemicals added in the 

preparation of the furnish, the operations at the paper machine and the modifications of the 

paper surface (Levlin and Söderhjelm, 2000; Moutinho et al. 2007b). 

Quantitative evaluation of printing quality is very difficult but very important, that is why in 

the last years the number of studies regarding this subject has increased substantially 

(Varnella 1998; Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000; Chen et al. 2002; Donderi et al. 

2003; Mattila et al. 2003; Rosenberger 2003; Glittenberg and Voigt 2004; Danby and 

Zhou 2004; Svanholm 2004; Lee et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005; Olsson et al. 2006; 

Mäkenen et al. 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ungh et al. 2007) 

 

1.6 ABOUT THE WORK 

The work described in this thesis was motivated by the need of increasing the knowledge in 

specific fields related to paper ink interactions. This need was driven by the growing 

importance of the printing quality in the costumer demands and by the recognition of paper 

surface modification as a major tool to improve the quality of many paper products as 

described in Section 1.3

Besides the scarce information on this topic in the open literature, the available information is 

not focused in printing and writing papers produced with eucalyptus globulus fibers, which is 

the core of the Portuguese papermaking industry. Thus this study is pioneer in the surface 

studies of paper and also and in particular in the context the Portuguese paper industry and 

research. 

Before embracing this larger and longer work, a previous one was performed, as 

undergraduate student, whose main purpose was to compare the impact of different surface 

sizing agents on the surface properties and printing quality of paper sheets prepared in the 

laboratory. Despite the limitation of using handsheets, this work pointed out many aspects 

that required further investigation (Moutinho et al. 2004). Furthermore, it provided a first 

contact with this field, namely with the phenomena related to the interactions between paper 

and sizing formulation and/or printing inks as well as with techniques currently used to 

characterize the surface of the paper samples. This constituted the main incentive for this 

project that includes the present thesis, whose main objective is to analyze the effect of the 

addition of different types of synthetic surface sizing agents to the more classical surface 

sizing blend (composed of cationic starch) on the properties of commercial paper sheets, in 

particular, on inkjet printing performance. In order to apply the obtained results and 

conclusions to the industry, all the steps of the work followed as close as possible the 

industrial practice. Furthermore the selection of the surface sizing was also performed having 

this point in mind.  

Finally, it is important to stress that this work is focused on surface sizing and not on coating. 

The main difference between these two surface treatments lies on the fact that the coating 

blends include pigments and the amount applied is usually above 6 g/m2. Moreover printing 

and writing papers (P&amp;amp;W) are not usually coated. 

The experimental work carried out in order to achieve these goals involves the following 

main steps:  

? Characterization/identification of the compounds used in the surface sizing 

blends. These were composed of cationic starch and different proportions of 

synthetic sizing agents. The sizing agents used ranged from styrene acrylate 

copolymers that have been recently applied for surface sizing at industrial level, to 

melamine copolymers that are not usually used for this purpose. The formulation 

constituted only by cationic starch was taken as reference, as it is the most commonly 

used. It should be highlighted that some of the sizing agents tested possessed distinct

chemical composition whereas others had identical composition but different 

molecular configurations. Additionally, the influence of their incorporation 

percentage was also investigated, using incorporation percentages of 5, 10 and 

20%. 

? Production of the surface sized samples. Preliminary studies were undertaken in 

order to optimize the surface sizing procedure. These included the selection of the 

formulations to be applied and the identification of the variables to be controlled, as 

will be detailed in Section 2.1.2. Additionally, also a methodology to guarantee the 

traceability of each paper sheet used was set. 

? Physical and Chemical characterization of the samples. As the major concern is 

about surface behavior, the characterization techniques focus mainly surface 

energetics (contact angle e inverse gas chromatography), surface topography 

(profilometry), and porosity (mercury porosimetry). It should be pointed out that 

these techniques are not used as routine and thus, a previous work was needed 

regarding each one of them, to establish the most adequate operating conditions 

and to fully interpret their results. Additionally, some of the samples were analyzed 

with more sophisticated techniques as AFM or ESCA in order to investigate specific 

details. 

? Evaluation of the inkjet printing performance of the samples. This is not a simple 

issue as it is a subject not usually disclosed in the open literature, and thus all the 

methodology was developed specifically for this work, using the available 

technologies. 

The surface sizing operation, which is the focus of this work, represents at the most 5% of the 

paper structure, depending on the paper basis weight, and the differences between the 

samples are necessarily limited by this fact. Thus it should be highlighted that previously to 

any analysis of the characterization results, these were subjected to Analysis of Variance 

(ANOVA), to guarantee that the differences between the samples were statistically valid. 

This document is organized in 11 Chapters: 

In this chapter (Introduction) some generic information regarding the papermaking process, 

surface sizing, paper surface characterization and printing in presented. It is also given a

Chapter 2 (Materials and Methods) describes the experimental procedures used in the work, 

in what concerns to the surface sizing operation, the paper surface characterization and the 

printing quality evaluation. However the characterization techniques are fully detailed in 

further chapters together with the corresponding results.  

Chapter 3 (Characterization of the Sizing Chemicals) covers the methodology developed to 

determine the composition and the properties of the compounds used in the sizing 

formulations (starch and synthetic surface sizing agents). 

 The following chapters concern the physical and chemical characterization of the paper 

surface of all 31 samples produced. Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 regard, respectively, to 

profilometry, mercury porosimetry, contact angle measurements, and inverse gas 

chromatography (IGC).The structure of theses chapters is similar. They are all divided in two 

sub-sections: firstly the principles of the technique, details and the methodology used are 

described and, secondly, the corresponding results are presented and analyzed. 

Chapter 8 (Printing Quality) covers the method used to evaluate the inkjet printing 

performance of the samples and the corresponding results. Mathematical models were 

implemented in order to correlate the values of the printing parameters with the surface 

properties determined in the previous chapters. 

Chapter 9 (Complementary Studies) is a compilation of scientific papers (published and 

submitted) regarding specific aspects of the work. These papers involve either only a few 

samples and/or a particular characterization technique which were found adequate to point 

out a particular aspect of the work. 

Chapter 10 (Conclusions) summarizes the main conclusions that can be withdrawn from this 

study and points out some suggestions for future work. 

Chapter 11 (References) is used to list the most relevant publications consulted to accomplish 

this work, were detailed information on a given subject can be consulted. 

The thesis is also complemented by a series of appendices (Appendix A to G.) where 

additional information is presented, mainly in tables and plots. This was done to avoid 

making the main text too extensive and too hard to follow.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

As detailed in Section 1.6, this work aims at modifying the surface properties of printing and 

writing paper sheets through surface sizing. For that, different surface sizing formulations 

(previously characterized) will be tested and the corresponding sized samples characterized 

in terms of their physical and chemical properties. Finally the impact of the surface 

modifications into the inkjet printing quality will also be evaluated.  

Figure 2.1 represents schematically the methodology used to achieve these objectives. 

 

Figure 2.1 – Schematic representation of the methodology used in this work 

 

The compounds and techniques involved in this work will be described in this chapter, in four 

different sections: Section 2.1 that not only describes the sizing equipment but also the sizing 

formulations, which will be followed by an explanation of the techniques used to characterize 

the sizing agents (Section 2.2) and to characterize the sized paper sheets (Section 2.3). 

Finally, information on how printing quality is evaluated will be given in Section 2.4. More 

extensive descriptions will be provided regarding the surface sizing process and the sizing 

formulations, whereas only a brief explanation of the techniques used to characterize the 

sized paper samples will be presented, since these will be supplied in subsequent chapters 

along with the corresponding experimental results (Chapters 4 to 8).

2.1 SURFACE SIZING 

2.1.1 EQUIPMENT AND METHODOLOGY 

The surface sizing formulations were applied to a base paper (79 ± 0.5 g/m2 basis weight), 

produced in a paper mill with an Eucalyptus globulus Kraft pulp. This paper was calendered 

(20 KN/m calendering pressure) and had no surface chemical treatment of any kind. 

The Mathis laboratory device, model SVA-IR-B (illustrated in Figure 2.2), was used for paper 

sheet surface sizing. It operates automatically with velocities ranging from 1 to 10 m/min 

and can be used with three applicator rolls of different diameters. A preliminary study was 

undertaken in order to optimize the sizing procedure. The main goal was to obtain a sizing 

amount (pick-up) similar to that of industrial scale (usually approximately between 2 and 5 

g/m2). This was achieved using the 0.15 mm roll in conjunction with a velocity of 6 m/min. A 

pick-up of 3.5 ± 0.3 g/m2 (including both faces) was reached for these operating conditions. 

Additionally, and to minimize the migration of the sizing formulations into the fibrous matrix 

paper samples were subsequently dried (Figure 2.2) using the maximum intensity available 

for the IR dryer (1.0 kW).  

Due to equipment limitations, the sizing process was performed separately for each side of 

the paper sheets. The uniformity of the application with the selected conditions was 

confirmed using a colored blend (by sizing the paper sheet with a colored blend it is easily 

observed the evenness for the color distribution at the surface, indicating that the equipment 

allows good uniformity). The surface sized samples produced were no further calendered 

since this mechanical operation could mask the effect of the different sizing formulations in 

what concerns the physical properties of the paper surface.

sheet is placed in the support table and secured with the sample holder, after, using a syringe, a straight line 

of sizing blend is manually spread in front of the applicator roll, with it in the start position (right in front of 

the sample holder) by pressing the start bottom on the control panel, the applicator roll spreads the sizing 

blend at the paper surface and the IR dryer dries it partially immediately after the application. 

 

At least 20 paper sheets (A3 size) were sized with each sizing formulation in order to obtain 

enough appropriate samples for further analysis. For each set the following was observed: 

? Identification of each of the A3 paper sheets used; 

? Determination of the exact net basis weight of each unsized paper sheet (weight of 

each paper sheet and basis weight calculation according to the dimensions;  

? Sizing of a set of 20 paper sheets for each sizing formulation, according to the 

procedure described above;  

? Determination of the net basis weight after surface sizing and consequent determination 

of the surface sizing pick-up (from the weight difference). 

? Selection of the paper sheets with adequate pick-up (3.5 ± 0.3 g/m2 in both sides); 

For each surface sizing formulation, an average of 10 paper sheets with the required pick-

up was obtained.

2.1.2 SIZING FORMULATIONS 

As mentioned before (Chapter 1), the most common sizing formulation applied in 

papermaking is cationic starch alone; however there is an increasing tendency, already 

applied in several paper mills, of combine the cationic starch with some synthetic surface 

sizing agents. 

Thus and in order to be as close as possible to the industrial practice, the first sizing 

formulation used in the present work was also cationic starch, which was taken as reference. 

The cationic starch suspension was collected immediately before the size press of the paper 

machine and consequently includes all the size press additives (such as OBA, salt, biocide and 

anti-foam). Subsequently other sizing formulations were tested, in a total 30, consisting of 

blends of cationic starch and small amounts of synthetic surface sizing agents (up to 20% 

w/w). The latter were not only copolymers containing styrene and acrylate, also commonly 

used in the paper industry, but also included styrene, acrylate and melamine based 

compounds in order to expand the chemical variability of the sizing agents tested. Table 2.1 

lists the compounds used in the preparation of the surface sizing formulations and the 

corresponding abbreviations.

Co-styrene-acrylate* S9 
Co-styrene-acrylate* S10 

                                  * Different monomers proportion 

 

Although cationic starch was the predominant component of the blends, concentrations of 5, 

10 and 20% of the different synthetic surface sizing agents were used. An incorporation of 

10% is usually found in the paper mills for this kind of formulations, being  20% the 

maximum allowed in a paper machine, namely due to white water contamination problems. 

In the present work 5% incorporation percentage was additionally selected in order to 



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 27 

expand the concentration range of the surface sizing agent providing a better picture of its 

influence. 

The nomenclature used to identify the sizing formulations was:  

StSi-j 

Meaning St that the blend contains cationic starch, taken as standard (St), while Si-j indicates 

that the blend includes surface sizing agent Si (i varies from 1 to 10, see Table 2.1), in the 

percentage j (j equals 5, 10 or 20 w/w). For instance, formulation StS2-10 is composed of 

cationic starch and surface sizing agent S2 (Co-styrene-maleic anhydride, Table 3.1) in a 

percentage of 10 of S2 and (consequently) 90% of cationic starch. In Appendix B are 

summarized the blends composition. 

 

2.2 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SURFACE SIZING AGENTS 

The knowledge of the characteristics of the compounds used to prepare the surface sizing 

formulations, in what concerns either their chemical composition or their physical and chemical 

properties, as this information is crucial to relate the resultant surface modifications with the 

performance of the sized paper sheets, namely in terms of printing quality. 

Since most of the co-polymers used as surface sizing agents were commercial products, the 

information about their chemical characteristics, provided by the corresponding datasheets 

(Appendix A), was rather limited (or confidential). Thus, it was necessary to carry out some 

additional measurements namely density, elemental analysis, particle size, pH, solids content 

and total surface tension. As described later (Chapter 3) this information enabled the 

schematic representation of the compounds molecules.  

 

2.3 PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PAPER SAMPLES 

The characterization of the paper samples produced was performed by using several 

techniques, listed in Table 2.2. Some of these techniques (profilometry, mercury porosimetry, 

contact angle and IGC) were applied for all samples, while others (AFM, ESCA, ToF-SIMS 

and SEM) could only be applied in some samples (mainly because they are not available in 

our laboratories). Detailed considerations about all these techniques will be presented in the

next chapters (Chapter 4 to Chapter 7) together with the analysis of the corresponding 

results.

2.4 PRINTING QUALITY EVALUATION 

To evaluate the printing quality all the samples were printed with a specific mask (Figure 

2.3) using the inkjet printer HP5652. Inkjet printing quality was evaluated both by 

quantitative measurements and by subjective evaluation. The quantitative measurements 

include: Optical Density, measured by the spectrophotometer Gretag D19C;  Gamut Area, 

determined through the CIE Lab color coordinates obtained for six colors by using the 

AvaMouse spectrophotometer (Avantes); and Line quality, evaluated using the Personal  

Image Analysis system PIA BASF – 8042319 for the black line with yellow background. 

Subjective evaluation was based on the observation of a panel members and subsequent 

classification of the printed images depicted in Figure 2.3.

3 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SIZING CHEMICALS 

As mentioned before, most of the surface sizing agents used in this work were not prepared 

in the lab but were supplied by industrial producers and the information available was 

limited to the respective compound datasheet. Figure 3.1 illustrates, as an example, the typical 

information available in a datasheet (a copy of all the available datasheets used is given in 

Appendix A) 

As it can be seen, besides the name of the compound (monomer), the data provided in those 

datasheets is rather vague (frequently corresponding to a range rather than to an accurate 

value).

The following sections report the measurements and calculations undertaken to gather a relevant 

set of properties of the sizing agents, which will be most useful for the interpretation of the 

paper surface properties and printing quality results. 

 

3.1 SIZING AGENTS COMPOSITION 

As mentioned before, the compounds datasheets give information on the monomers that 

constitute each copolymer. However, nothing is revealed about the monomers proportion. 

Although several attempts were made to experimentally determine this parameter, a trial 

and error procedure was found to be necessary to establish this proportion for each sizing 

agent used. 

The methodology followed, described in Figure 3.2 in the form of a flowchart, was based on 

three types of inputs: 

? Identification of the monomers present in each copolymer (given in the datasheet); 

? Chemical composition of each monomer (NIST database, 2004) 

?  Elemental composition (N, C, H, O) experimentally determined by elemental analysis 

(Table 3.1).

Essentially, this methodology consists of a first estimation of the monomers proportion, from 

which, based on the corresponding chemical formula (NIST database), it is possible to 

calculate the elements percentage (N, C, H, O). These are then compared to the results 

obtained from sample elemental analysis (Table 4.1) and adjusted until both match. The 

proportion of the monomers estimated in this way is listed in Table 3.2.

Knowing the chemical composition of the compounds, a schematic representation of the 

molecules structure was drawn, using the freeware software ChemSketch (Figure 3.3). When 

necessary (S1 and S9), additional information of the compounds properties, such as particle 

size and surface tension was considered to validate the structure drawn.

From Figure 3.3 it is clear that there are visible differences either in the composition as in the 

structure of the compounds that will most certainly led to distinct chemical properties.  

 

3.2 SIZING AGENTS PROPERTIES 

Additionally to the chemical composition, some other relevant properties of the compounds 

used in the sizing formulations (both cationic starch and synthetic surface sizing agents) had to 

be determined, as described below:  

? Density was measured by liquid picnometry, following ISO 758 method. 

? Particle size was determined, from a dilute suspension previously sonicated, by photon 

correlation spectroscopy using the COULTER® N4 Plus. Three independent samples were 

prepared and three measurements were taken for each one.  

? pH measurements were performed following ISO 787-9 method (Lehtinen, 2000). 

? Solids content determination was carried out at 105 ºC (SCAN-P 39:80) (Lehtinen, 

2000). 

? The total surface tension was determined using the contact angle measurement device 

OCA20 from Dataphysics (as described in detail in Chapter 6) using the pendant drop 

method.  

The results obtained for the several properties are gathered in Table 3.3. However, in some 

cases, these properties could not be measured due to experimental restrictions (eg. Some 

surface tension values could not be achieved due to the viscosity of some sizing agents).

As can be seen from this table, the compounds exhibit relevant differences in terms of 

particle size, surface tension and pH. This was not surprising considering the significant 

diversity of the constituent molecules.  

The values of these properties will be used in combination with the composition and structure 

of the compounds to interpret some surface properties and behaviors of the sized papers.

4.1 THEORY 

Surface texture is a property naturally associated to any material, from the large scale of a 

mountain to the small scale measured by a microscope. Paper is no exception for this rule of 

nature, since its surface is always textured (Thomas 1998). 

The surface texture, most commonly called topography, is often crucial for the end-use 

properties of any type of paper. For printing and writing papers (P&amp;amp;W), surface texture is a 

physical characteristic which results from the production process itself and it is an important 

factor affecting printability (Ashori et al. 2007). 

In the surface topography of P&amp;amp;W papers, four components can be distinguished, according 

to the scale: form, waviness, roughness and micro-roughness, as depicted in Figure 4.1 

(Wagberg and Johansson 2002; URL 2; URL 3): 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.1 – Different surface texture components (URL 2; URL 3). 

 

Among the components of the surface topography of P&amp;amp;W papers, roughness and micro-

roughness stand out from the remaining, since due to the topographic range to which it 

corresponds it becomes the most relevant to be considered for printing processes. From this 

point on, the term roughness will include these two components of surface texture. 

Roughness directly controls gloss and also has a major role in determining printing quality 

and uniformity.  Thus, it is an important property to be accessed in order to adequately 

characterize paper surface. From its measurements several parameters are obtained, which 

are usually called topographical parameters. 

Topographical parameters can be computed from two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional 

(3D) profile analysis of the paper surface. The calculation of 2D parameters has widely 

been carried out in science and engineering for almost a century. However, in more recent 

years, there has been evidence of an increasing need for 3D surface analysis.

This need arises partially as a result of the recognition that all surfaces interact in three 

rather than two dimensions. In some cases 2D parameters introduced in many national and 

international standards are inadequate to give a comprehensive description of 3D surfaces 

and thus unable to meet the need of a wide variety of applications (Stout at al. 1993; Dong 

et al. 1994a; Dong et al. 1994b; Wågberg 2002). 

The functional applications of the materials in fields like wear, friction, lubrication, fatigue, 

sealing, painting, etc., are deeply influenced by the amplitude and spatial characteristics of 

the 3D surface topography of the materials (Dong et al. 1994a). 

 

4.1.1 ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS DEFINITION 

3D topography is complex and cannot be described completely by a single or a few 

parameters.  

Each one of the roughness parameters reduce all the information in a profile to a single 

number which is calculated using a specific formula. As each parameter only describes one 

aspect of the topography, a set of parameters is necessary to accurately characterize 

surface topography (Dong et al 1994a; Wågberg 2002). 

Some of these parameters are naturally extended from their 2D counterparts; others are 

uniquely defined for 3D topography. Currently, in order to distinguish 2D and 3D 

parameters, a capital letter “S” (meaning that it is calculated from an area (or surface) 

rather than a line) is used to identify 3D parameters whereas a capital “R” is traditionally 

used for 2D parameters (Stout et al. 1993; Dong et al 1994a; Dong et al 1994b; Cohen 

2006). 

3D measurement systems are all digital height measurement systems. They represent the 

measured surface with a set of data usually in the form of a x-y matrix of the Cartesian 

coordinate, where x and y spacing are not necessarily the same (Stout et al. 1993; Dong et 

al. 1994a; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008). 

An equally spaced digitalized 3D surface, can be denoted by z(xi, yj) (xi=i?x, yj=j?y; 

i=1,2,…M; j=1,2,…,N), where ?x and ?y are the sampling intervals, and M and N 

represent the number of sampling points in the x and y directions, respectively (Stout et al. 

1993; Dong et al. 1994a; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

Parameters used to describe surfaces are mainly statistical indicators that can be divided in 

amplitude parameters, spacing parameters and hybrid parameters. 

 

4.1.1.1 Amplitude Parameters 

Amplitude parameters, defined below, are a class of surface parameters based on the 

vertical deviations of the roughness profile from the mean plane, i.e. the best fitting plane, 

also called reference plane (Figure 4.2). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.2 – Exemplification of the deviations from the reference plane for a given profile line (Gadelmawla 

et al. 2002).  

 

Most of them are closely related to the parameters found in statistics for characterizing 

population samples. The reference plane of the calculation of these parameters is the mean 

plane of the measured surface (Stout et al. 1993; Gadelmawla et al. 2002; Cohen 2006; 

TrueGage 2008). 

They can be divided in: i) dispersion; ii) asymmetry of the height distribution, and iii) extreme 

parameters. 

 i) Dispersion Parameters 

Sa - The roughness average - is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the surface 

height deviations (Figure 4.3) measured from the reference plane, given by:

Sa was one of the first parameters used to quantify surface texture and is the most 

universally recognized roughness parameter for general quality control. It is easy to define,

easy to measure and gives a good general description of height variations (Gadelmawla et 

al. 2002) However, it only quantifies the “absolute” magnitude of the surface heights, and 

thus a deep valley or a high peak will result in the same Sa. Moreover, it is insensitive to their 

spatial distribution, in that two very high peaks will contribute the same to Sa whether the 

peaks are close to each other or separated.  In fact, surfaces with grossly different features 

may have the same Sa. (Stout et al. 1993; Bastos 2004; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.3 – Representation of the surface height deviations for a given profile line: (a) real values; (b) 

absolute values (Cohen 2006). 

 

Sq - The root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of the surface - is the standard deviation or “first 

moment” of the height distribution (Figure 4.3) and it is an important parameter to describe 

the surface roughness by statistical methods.

Sq is very similar to Sa since the surface heights are “squared” prior to being 

integrated/averaged, and thus peaks and valleys of equal height/depth are 

indistinguishable. Therefore a series of high peaks or a series of deep valleys of equal 

magnitude will produce the same Sq value (Stout et al. 1993; Bastos 2004; Cohen 2006; 

TrueGage 2008). 

ii) Asymmetry of the Height Distribution Parameters 

Ssk - The skewness is the “second moment” of the height distribution - indicates if the surface is 

composed of primarily one plateau and how much the valleys and/or peaks deviate from 

this plateau (Figure 4.4).

Since the height values are cubed prior to the integration/averaging, the polarity of the 

surface is maintained. Thus a surface with predominantly deep valleys will tend to have a 

negative skew, whereas a surface comprised predominantly of peaks will have positive 

skew. Due to the big exponent used, this parameter is very sensitive to the sampling and to 

the noise of the measurement. (Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).  

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.4 – Typical surface structure, demonstrating peaks and valleys (Cohen 2006). 

 

Sku - The kurtosis, is the “third moment” of the height distribution - is the “third moment” of the 

height distribution and characterizes the anomalies in the surface height distributions in that a 

normally (i.e. following a Gaussian or Bell curve distribution) disturbed surface texture would 

tend to have a value of Sku = 3.

When the surface texture is composed of non-normally distributed high peaks or deep 

valleys, the Sku becomes very large. When the surface is composed of a slowly varying, 

“rolling” hill type texture, the Sku will be less than 3. Sku is a good indicator when an 

otherwise Gaussian distributed surface may have some defects. Due to the big exponent 

used, this parameter is very sensitive to the sampling and to the noise of the measurement 

(Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008). 

ii) Extreme Parameters 

These parameters are evaluated from the absolute highest peak and lowest valley found on 

the surface. A peak is defined as any point above all 8 nearest neighbors. A valley is any 

point, which is bellow all 8 nearest neighbors. 

Sp - The maximum height of summits - is the distance between the highest peak and the mean 

plane (Figure 4.5) (Stout et al. 1993; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

 Isabel M. T. Moutinho 48 

Sv - The maximum depth of the surface - is the distance between the mean plane and the 

deepest valley (Figure 4.5) (Stout et al. 1993; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).  

St - The total height of the surface - is the height between the highest peak and the deepest 

valley (Figure 4.5) (Stout et al. 1993; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

Sz - The ten point height of the surface – is the mean of distance between the 5 highest peaks 

and the 5 deepest holes. A neighborhood of 3×3 unit areas is taken into account to find out 

the peaks and the valleys (Stout et al. 1993; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

4.1.1.2 Spatial Parameters 

The spatial parameters are those which measure the horizontal characteristics of the surface 

deviations.

making up the surface. Summits are derived from peaks. This parameter is expressed in

Peaks are constrained to being separated by at least 1% of the minimum “x” or “y” 

dimension comprising the 3D measurement areas. Additionally, summits are only found above 

a threshold that is 5% of Sz above the mean plane (Figure 4.7) (Bastos 2004; Cohen 2006; 

TrueGage 2008).

Str - The texture aspect ratio of the surface, is a measure of the spatial isotropy or directionality 

of the surface texture. This parameter has a value between 0 and 1. If the value is near 1, 

the surface is isotropic, i.e. has the same characteristics in all directions. If the value is near 0, 

the surface is anisotropic, i.e. has an oriented and/or periodical structure (Stout et al. 1993; 

Bastos 2004; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

Hybrid parameters are a class of surface parameters characterized by depending both on 

amplitude and spacing, such as slopes, curvatures, etc.

Sdq - The root-mean-square slope of the surface – is the modulus of the decay value, 

measured in several small segments, through the tangent to the angle formed between each 

segment and the horizontal direction. Smoother surfaces correspond to small Sdq values

Sdr - The developed interfacial area ratio - indicates the complexity of the surface due to the 

comparison of the curvilinear surface and the geometric surface. A completely flat surface 

will have an Sdr near to 0%. A complex surface will have an Sdr of some percents (Stout et 

al. 1993; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008).

Sdr may further differentiate surfaces of similar amplitudes and average roughness. 

Typically Sdr will increase with the spatial intricacy of the texture whether or not Sa changes. 

Sdr is useful in applications involving surface coatings and adhesion. 

 

4.1.2 ROUGHNESS MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES AND EQUIPMENTS 

The techniques for paper roughness measurement can be classified in two categories. One 

type of measurement simulates the printing process under pressure, and the other, called 

profilometry, determines an effective three-dimensional (3D) surface profile (Barros 2004; 

Ashori et al, 2008). 

Air-leak methods, such as Bendtsen and Parker Print-Surf (PPS), were developed to simulate 

printing pressure. Unfortunately air-leak meters have some drawbacks in paper surface 

research. Because the total airflow volume is measured, no information is obtained about the 

surface structure in detail. In other words, traditional surface roughness assessing instruments 

give average numbers for the measured area but do not provide any detailed description of 

the paper surface. This makes such instruments less suitable for revealing details of the 

surface treatments effect (Barros 2004; Ashori et al, 2008). 

As for the determination of the three-dimensional (3D) surface profile, its purpose is to 

present a surface profile under room conditions as accurately as possible. There are two 

types of methods to perform profilometry measurements: Contacting methods (Stylus 

profilometry) and non-contacting methods (Optical profilometry). Laser and electron 

microscopy can also be applied for profilometry measurements, embracing both contacting 

and non-contacting methods (Barros 2004; Ashori et al 2008).

 Isabel M. T. Moutinho 52 

The Stylus instruments (Figure 4.9) are easily described as a mechanical instrument that 

contacts with the surface under analysis and profiles it by following the surface details as 

accurately as possible. These instruments can have several configurations, particularly in what 

concerns to the tip that touches the surface. Its simplicity, however, is associated to several 

limitations: on one hand, since the instrument touches the surface, there is the risk of damaging 

it. On the other hand, since the stylus is an artifact of finite dimensions, it sometimes fails to 

follow peaks and valleys faithfully and produces a distorted record of the surface. The 

“traced profile” (ISO 3274, 1996) recorded by the Stylus instrument is the locus of the centre 

of the stylus, thus, if the contacting portion of the stylus is assumed to be spherical in section, 

the radius of curvature of a peak may be exaggerated, while the valley may be 

represented as a cusp (Thomas, 1998; Barros 2004).  

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.9 - Principle of a contacting stylus instrument profilometer: A cantilever (1) is holding a small tip (2) 

that is sliding along the horizontal direction (3) over the object's surface (5). Following the profile the 

cantilever is moving vertically (4). The vertical position is recorded as the measured profile (6) shown in light 

green. 

 

The optical instruments used to access surface roughness are based in the simple principle 

that when electromagnetic radiation is incident on a rough surface a portion of its energy, 

depending on the local physical properties of the surface, will be reflected and the reflected 

beam will carry information about the roughness (Thomas, 1998). The radiation may be 

reflected either specularly or diffusely or both (Figure 4.10). Reflection is totally specular 

when the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence (Snell’s law), and a surface 

that reflects radiation in this manner is said to be smooth. Reflection is totally diffuse when 

the energy in the incident beam is distributed in all directions (Barros 2004; Thomas, 1998).

Figure 4.10 – Schematic representation of the different types for reflection of the incident radiation. 

 

According to Vorburger &amp;amp; Teague (1981) the optical techniques can be divided in profiling 

and parametric. Profiling techniques are associated with specular reflection, whereas 

parametric techniques are associated mainly with diffuse reflection (Thomas, 1998). One 

possible method of optical measurement is simply to use the light beam as a non-contacting 

stylus for profile measurement. The most straightforward method is to detect the change in 

the angle of specular reflection as the surface is moved under an incident beam.  

There are some general aspects that have to be considered in order to choose a specific 

measuring instrument: cost, ease of operation, size and robustness. There is also the issue of 

whether a measurement is relative or absolute. In addition, for roughness measuring 

instruments, it is necessary to decide whether or not the instrument should have a physical 

contact with the surface, and whether it needs to be able to measure an area of a surface or 

only a section or profile through it. Most important of all are the horizontal and vertical 

range and resolution. In fact every instrument or technique presents some limitations of 

resolution, and the actual values involved will vary from instrument to instrument (Thomas 

1998; Barros 2004). 

 

4.1.2.1 Equipment - Altisurf® 500 

In this work, and in order to obtain the roughness parameters without the effect of any 

external force, a non-contact profilometer was chosen, the Altisurf®500 profilometer 

manufactured by Cotec-Ca (France), coupled with the PaperMap Software. This non-contact 

device gives accurate height information with the possibility of visual evaluation of the 3D 

surface structure of paper samples (Bastos 2004; Ashori et al. 2007).  

The system consists of a white light source, lens, spectrophotometer, a signal processing 

system, together with a motorized sample holder and appropriate image analysis software

(Figure 4.11). The white light source (quartz-halogen) is focused through the lens onto the 

sample to be analyzed. The reflected light is passed through a pinhole into a 

spectrophotometer where built-in software is used to select the wavelength of maximum 

intensity, which is used to determine the relative height of that point.  

The sample is fixed to the sample holder, which is scanned under an adequately positioned 

fixed sensor. A 3D surface profile (topographic map) can be created, visualizing the 

irregularities of the papers surface (two-dimensional line scans can also be measured). The 

sample holder moves the sample, by pre-programmed steps, under the focused beam. The 

resolution in the x and y directions (from 0.5 to 100 µm) and the area (up to 10×10 cm) to 

be measured are selectable. By choosing an appropriate filter (e.g., Gaussian) the roughness 

of interest can be obtained (Ashori et al. 2008; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.11– Schematic representation of the optical profilometer used in this work (Ashori et al. 2008). 

 

In this study, for each paper sample, 6 pieces of 4×4 mm2 were scanned, with a scanning 

resolution of 2 µm. Therefore 2000 profiles were obtained for each piece. From the data 

acquisition, a 3D surface profile is obtained (Figure 4.12 (a)), then several mathematical 

operations are performed in order to apply adequate mathematical filters to the results and  

to highlight the relevant information, by excluding the surface texture components that are 

less relevant  (Figure 4.12 (b) to Figure 4.12 (e)).  

The mathematical treatment includes the following operators: 



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps

? Leveling operation – corresponds to the application of a mathematical filter to remove 

the general slope of a surface, caused by a measurement that was not strictly 

horizontal due to the inclination of the sample on the support used to fix it. Figure 4.12 

(b) represents the analyzed area after this correction. 

? 4th degree polynomial form removal - This operator consists in mathematically 

removing the general form of a surface. The remaining information, made up of 

waviness and roughness, can then be studied separately (Figure 4.12 (c)).  

? Filtering waviness and roughness (0.8 mm filter) - This operator is used to separate the 

roughness and waviness phenomena of the surface. The quality of the separation 

depends both on the type of filter and the cut-off value. This process allows obtaining a 

roughness and a waviness surface that can then be studied individually (Figure 4.12 

(d)).

artificially truncate the surface at a given altitude (at the top and/or bottom). This 

operator is especially useful for suppressing peaks that are too large and that 

therefore hide other relieves, or for simulating a wear process (Figure 4.12 (e)).

4.2 RESULTS 

Figure 4.14 illustrates the final result of the profilometry measurement procedure, and 

presents, as an example, the values obtained for one of the measurements performed for 

samples St. 

 

Figure 4.14 - Output obtained from each of the profilometry measurements. In this case, for sample St as an 

example. 

 

The profilometry measurements were performed for each of the 31 samples. Since 6 

measurements per samples were performed, an enormous amount of information was 

obtained. Thus, the first step to work with valuable and useful information through the 

profilometry measurements was to isolate the parameters that better characterize the 

samples. In order to do that, a 2 components PCA was applied. For the purpose of paper 

surface analysis it is possible to isolate, among all the parameters presented in Section 4.1.1, 

10 that may be considered the most relevant as the start point for the PCA analysis: Sa, Sq, 

Sp, Sv, St, Ssk, Ssc, Str, Sdq and Sdr. The result is presented in Figure 4.15. 

Sa = 2.82 µm 

Sq = 3.56 µm 

Sp = 8.61 µm 

Sv = 10.9 µm 

St = 19.5 µm 

Ssk = -0.313 

Ssc = 0.182 1/µm 
Str = 0.545 

Sdq = 0.502 µm/ µm 
Sdr = 11.6 %

Figure 4.15 - PCA using the descriptive variables obtained by profilometry.  

 

For this set of 10 variables a 73% degree of explanation of the results variability (51% 1st 

component; 22% 2nd component) was obtained. According to the correlation loadings, the 

variables Ssc, Sdq and Sdr can be eliminated from the set (as they exhibit the smaller 

correlation loadings). The resulting PCA analysis is presented in Figure 4.16. 

 

Figure 4.16 - PCA using 7 of the descriptive variables. 

 

This new set, composed by the variables Sa, Sq, Sp, Sv, St, Ssk and Str, explain 90% of the 

results variability (61% 1st component; 29% 2nd component), and so it is adequate to 

describe the set of 31papers. These seven parameters will be the ones used to analyze the 

effect of surface sizing in topography. It is important to mention that although the variable 

Sdr was eliminated from this set due to its smaller descriptive power regarding the effect of 

surface sizing in paper roughness, it will be used later in this work to correct the contact 

angle values (Section 6.2.1). 

By applying ANOVA to the topographical parameters selected by PCA it is possible to 

analyze in detail the variations in the results of each parameter. The results are presented in 

Table 4.1.

The quality of this analysis is confirmed by the reduced values of the P factor for all 

variables analyzed and also because F is much greater than Fcritical, for all variables. Thus the 

use of this analysis to perform truthful considerations is validated. 

According to results previously published by other authors (Ström 2003; Ashori et al 2008), it 

is generally believed that a film (surface sizing and/or coating) on the top of a paper sheet 

reduces roughness by filling the depression irregularities of the paper surface. However, the 

main observation that can be drawn from Table 4.1 is that there is a large variability within 

samples, which indicates that the addition of the surface sizing agents to the cationic starch 

has a reduced impact on the surface topography.  This was not totally unexpected, since 

even considering the largest percentage of surface sizing agent added (20%), the surface 

sizing blend is composed mainly of starch (80%). It should also be remembered that the main 

objective of the copolymers addition is to change the chemical rather than the physical 

properties of the surface. Detailed results corresponding to the several topographic 

parameters and additional plots can be consulted in Appendix C. Here, the analysis will be 

illustrated with the most adequate and relevant plots. 

In order to have a general understanding of the surface topography of the samples, the most 

adequate variables, Sa and Sq, corresponding respectively to the average roughness and 

the root mean square roughness deviation, are represented in Figure 4.17. 

Figure 4.17 presents the results according to the percentage of surface sizing agent added 

to the sizing blend. In these graphs the interval within which the differences from the 

standard sample are not valid (based on the reproducibility factor) is also represented (the 

interval between the dashed lines).

Figure 4.17 – Sa and values obtained for all the paper samples, divided according to the amount of surface 

sizing agent added; (a) Sa values for samples with 5% of surface sizing agent; (b) Sa values of the samples 

with 10% of surface sizing agent, (c) Sa values of the samples with 20% of surface sizing agent. Lines 

 delimit the interval (based on ANOVA) in which the samples are not distinguishable from the St 

sample.  

 

From the observation of Figure 4.17 it is possible to notice that there is not a clear tendency 

among the different samples, for any of the incorporation percentages. In some cases Sa 

and/or Sq increase when the synthetic copolymers are added to the cationic starch while in 

others they diminish. However, the Sq values are high, which means that these samples have 

a large amount of valleys or peaks (this variable does not allow to differentiate valleys from 

peaks, as mentioned before). 

Figure 4.18 illustrates the effect of the concentration increase in the surface topography, 

using as example some surface sizing agents with quite different behaviors.

Figure 4.18 – Influence of the surface sizing agent concentration in the Sa values; (a) surface sizing agent S1; 

(b) surface sizing agent S4, (c) surface sizing agent S5, (d) surface sizing agent S7. 

 

From Figure 4.18 it is clear that the increase of the surface sizing agent amount has not a 

consistent impact on Sa. Besides, the differences can not be recognized or analyzed as a 

result of the surface modifications performed, since they are not statistically significant. 

From the analysis of the maximum height (Sp), the maximum depth (Sv) and the Skewness 

(Ssk) it is possible to verify whether are the valleys or the peaks that dominate the 

topography of the samples. The results are presented in Table 4.2.

For all samples, the Sv values are larger than the Sp values, meaning that these samples 

have more deep valleys than high peaks. This is also confirmed by the Ssk negative values.  

Since the surface sizing formulations were applied in a laboratory device which implies the 

contact of the sizing roll with the paper surface (Chapter 3), and considering a previous 

publications on this issue (Bodurtha et al. 2005), it is important to verify whether the

application process induces directionality in the surface of the paper samples. For that the 

texture aspect ratio of the surface, evaluated by the topographic parameter Str, must be 

analyzed. From the values of Str presented in Figure 4.19 it is possible to confirm that the 

paper surfaces exhibit a certain degree of anisotropy, since the Str values are mostly 

inferior to 0.5. However this anisotropy is not significant since the values are not too close to 

0. 

Figure 4.19 – Str values obtained for all the samples. 

 

Despite the impossibility of detailed comparisons between all the samples using the 

profilometry results, due to the little differences and the lack of statistical significance, some 

general characteristics of the physical properties of these paper samples can be underlined.  

The addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents changes the values of the topographical 

parameters, but not significantly. The surfaces are moderately rougher with a large 

predominance of valleys over peaks, and without any significant anisotropy.  

The topographical characteristics of the samples will certainly participate in the ink reception 

process, but since they are identical to all samples, they will not respond for the differences 

in terms of printing performance. 

Thus, any eventual distinct impact of the various sizing agents will only be noticed on the 

porous structure of the samples and/or on the chemical characteristics of the paper surface, 

which will be analyzed in the next chapters.

5 MERCURY POROSIMETRY 

5.1 THEORY 

The porosity of any type of material is defined as the ratio of the voids volume to the total 

volume of the sample:

voidsofVolume
Porosity

+
==                               (5.1) 

Paper is a porous material made of a network of fibers with voids in between. Porosity is a 

critical factor in all sorts of paper, from printing papers, filter papers, cigarette papers to 

bag papers.  In particular for P&amp;amp;W papers, porosity significantly affects opacity, bulk and 

the ink reception process (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Johnson et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). In 

fact, porosity indicates how paper will react to fluid penetration in coating, sizing and 

printing operations. Additionally, porosity can also be an important factor in a vacuum 

feeding operation of a printing press (Johnson et al. 1999) 

 

5.1.1 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES 

Although easy to define, paper porosity is hard to measure accurately and several 

techniques can be employed to quantify the volume of voids, whose values greatly depend 

upon the method and the conditions used (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Murakami and Imamura 

1980). However, two types of procedures are frequently used for paper porosity 

determination: the air resistance and air permeability methods and the methods involving 

volume or density measurements (Chinga and Helle 2002a; Bordurtha et al. 2005).  

The air resistance and air permeability methods are both based on the resistance to the 

passage of air offered by the paper structure when a pressure difference exists between 

the two sides of the paper. The air resistance is measured as the time for a given volume of 

air to flow through a specimen under specified conditions, while the air permeability is 

measured as the volume of air which flows through the paper for a given time interval, 

following the Sheffield Method (described in TAPPI T 547) or the Gurley Method (detailed in 

TAPPI T 460 and TAPPI T 536). Many papermakers rely upon Gurley Densometer tests to 

evaluate the porous nature of paper. However, it has been shown that the volume fraction 

available to flow (permeability) is not equal to porosity: papers can have the same

permeability but different porosities (Lindsay 1998; Lindsay 2000; Branton and Baker 

2002). 

The methods involving volume or density measurements include water saturation and 

evaporation methods, nitrogen gas adsorption or mercury intrusion porosimetry (Johnson et 

al. 1999; Alince et al. 2002). 

Among these methods, mercury porosimetry has an increasing use for paper porosity 

measurements, since it is able to characterize a wide range of pore sizes, from a few 

hundred micrometers to a few nanometers and a distribution of the pore sizes is also 

achieved (Alince et al. 2002). 

 

5.1.1.1 Mercury Porosimetry 

Mercury Porosimetry is based on the capillary law governing liquid penetration into small 

pores. This law, in the case of cylindrical pores and non wetting liquids like mercury is 

expressed by the Washburn equation (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Bordurtha et al. 2005):

where D is the pore diameter, P is the applied pressure, ? the surface tension, and ? the 

contact angle, all in consistent units. As this equation shows, the larger the pore size, the lower 

the pressure needed to overcome the capillary forces. Therefore the pore-size distribution 

can be measured by gradually increasing the pressure on a vessel (called penetrometer, 

Figure 5.1) containing a piece of paper submerged in mercury and measuring the intake of 

this by the paper after each increase of pressure. In this way a cumulative pore volume can 

be determined as a function of the applied pressure (or pore diameter, inversely 

proportional to pressure as described Washburn eq.), starting with the volume of the largest 

pores. The output is the so called intrusion curve.

Figure 5.1 – Schematic representation of a penetrometer used in mercury intrusion porosimetry (URL1 2008). 

It is constituted by a small reservoir where the sample is placed and a long stem. All this is full of mercury at 

the lowest pressure. As pressure is increased, mercury penetrates into the sample pores (intrusion) and the 

length of penetrometer stem that is filled with mercury decreases. The difference in mercury level corresponds 

to the volume intruded in the sample. 

 

However, real pores are never exactly cylindrical, and thus the measured pore radius is an 

equivalent circular pore radius. 

Mercury porosimetry data is not limited to porosity and pore size distribution but this 

technique also provides information about bulk and skeletal density. Bulk density is the ration 

between the weight and the bulk volume, which includes the solid volume as well as the 

volume of all empty spaces. This volume is measured at the lowest intrusion pressure.  In 

opposition the “skeletal” density, corresponding to the “skeletal” volume, refers to the volume 

of the sample discounting all the voids occupied by the mercury at the highest pressure 

(Micromeritics 2000). 

 

5.1.1.2 Equipment - AutoPore IV 9500 

In this study, the Micromeritics equipment AutoPore IV 9500 (Figure 5.2) was used to perform 

the mercury porosimetry measurements for all the 31 samples produced. In this apparatus 

mercury pressure is increased from about 1 psia up to 33 000 psia in two different

chambers: the low pressure port, where the increment in pressure is due to pressured gas (± 

2 atm (25 psia)) and the high pressure port where pressure is generated by an hydraulic 

system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 5.2 – Mercury porosimeter AutoPore IV 9500. 

 

After submitting the sample to a previous degasification, mercury is admitted to the 

penetrometer at a pressure of about 1-2 psia, being the pressure continuously increased up 

to about 25 psia at the low pressure port (covering pore diameters from 360 to 6 µm). The 

penetrometer is subsequently installed in the high pressure port where pressure is increased 

up to 33 000 psia, enabling the measurement of pore diameters as small as 5 nm. 

The analysis was repeated three times for each paper sample, using pieces of different 

sheets (approximately 10 pieces of about 1.5 x 1.5 cm2 per analysis). All the 31 samples 

were analyzed.

5.2 RESULTS 

As mentioned before, mercury data provides information not only about porosity but also 

about intrusion volume (volume of mercury per sample weight) and density (bulk and 

skeletal). These values are tabulated in Table 5.1 for one of the measurements performed 

for the reference sample (sized with cationic starch only) and for sample STS4-20, as an 

example. All the other values can be found in Appendix D.   

 

Table 5.1 – Exemplification of the mercury porosimetry output, using samples St and StS4-20. 

Sample = St  Sample = StS4-20 
Total Intrusion Volume = 0.7624 ml/g  Total Intrusion Volume = 0.7851 ml/g 
Bulk Density at 0.52 psia = 0.7450 g/ml  Bulk Density at 0.52 psia = 0.7181 g/ml 
Apparent (skeletal) Density = 1.7246 g/ml  Apparent (skeletal) Density = 1.6464 g/ml 
Porosity = 56.8003 %  Porosity = 56.3830% 
 

As it can be seen, and despite the different sizing formulations, the values obtained for the 

different parameters are quite similar: intrusion volumes of about 0.77mL/g, bulk densities 

close to 0.73 g/ml, skeletal densities of 1.65 and 1.72 g/ml and porosities of 

approximately 56% were obtained. Considering the totality of the samples tested the range 

of variation remains reduced: 0.68 - 0.85 ml/g for intrusion volume, 0.66 - 0.79 g/ml and 

1.45 - 1.80 g/ml for bulk and skeletal densities, respectively, and a variation between 

51.71 - 58.69 % regarding porosity. These values are in agreement with those published in 

literature (Moura et al. 2005) 

Regarding the skeletal density, the values measured are in general larger than that of 

cellulose (1.55 g/ml) which is compatible with the fact that paper contains other denser 

components besides cellulose fiber, such as fillers. 

In Figure 5.3 are represented the intrusion curves (differential and cumulative) of the St 

Sample, which exhibits two peaks: one at about 3 µm and another at about 20 µm. The 

same is detected for all the samples tested, whose curves can be consulted in Appendix D. 

This result is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors (Moura et al. 2005) for 

paper sheets and is usually associated to the mercury penetration into smaller pores of the 

paper internal structure.

Figure 5.3 - Differential (a) and cumulative (b) pore size distribution diagrams for sample St. 

 

The effect of the surface sizing agent amount is illustrated in Figure 5.4  for StS6-j samples, 

which also includes the curves corresponding to the standard sample (St). This figure shows 

that although the curves are quite close to each other, those corresponding to the larger 

copolymer concentrations are slightly but consistently displaced to the right (more evident in 

the differential curves), denoting a slight decrease in the pores size, as the amount of 

synthetic sizing agent increases.  This was a widespread effect in all samples and is 

probably due to the filling of the larger pores by the sizing formulation.

It should be pointed out that the effect of surface sizing on paper porosity has not been the 

subject of many studies but the general idea is that it decreases paper porosity (Martin 

2008). Moreover regarding the effect of adding distinct copolymers no studies are 

available in the open literature.  

Before continuing the study of the effect surface sizing on paper porosity, ANOVA was 

applied to the porosimetry data. The results are presented in Table 5.2 for all samples and 

for each group corresponding to a given concentration of the synthetic agents (5 %, 10 % 

and 20 %) 

 

Table 5.2 - ANOVA results for porosity.

Porosity (St + StSi-20) 22.28 77.72 5.14 0.77 0.63 2.30 

 

From Table 5.2 it is possible to observe that the statistical validity of this analysis is not 

guaranteed, since F is inferior to Fcritical. Nonetheless, it is worth to mention that, in general, 

the contribution to the total variation of the variability within samples is larger than that 

among the different samples. Therefore, the addition of the surface sizing agents does not 

have a relevant and consistent effect on the samples porosity, as evaluated by mercury 

intrusion. 

Figure 5.5 and  

Figure 5.6 represent the average porosities of all paper samples tested and of each 

copolymer incorporation percentage, respectively, and the corresponding deviations. In these 

graphs the interval within which the differences from the standard sample are not valid 

(based on the reproducibility factor) is also represented by the dashed lines.

In spite of the aforementioned lack of statistical significance, a slight decrease in sample 

porosity is noticed, in general, as the copolymer amount increases (relatively to the standard 

sample), in addition to the pore size diminution tendency detected in Figure 5.4. 

Furthermore, the small impact of the various surface sizing formulations on sample porosity is 

in agreement with profilometry data presented in Chapter 4, confirming the reduced 

influence of the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the surface sizing 

formulation in the physical properties of the paper. Thus, any eventual distinct impact of the 

various sizing agents will only be noticed on the chemical characteristics of the paper surface.

6 CONTACT ANGLE MEASUREMENTS 

6.1 THEORY 

6.1.1 FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS 

When a liquid is brought into contact with a solid, a solid-liquid interface is formed as a 

result of the molecular contact between the solid and the liquid. The importance of this 

interface in lots of applications has led to extensive studies over the past 60 years (Brigs 

1989; Adamson 1997).The molecular contact between the solid and the liquid is called 

wetting and is essential in many applications such as spreading of coatings or adhesion and 

absorption into porous solids as paper sheets. 

The knowledge of the factors controlling the interaction between the paper and the different 

liquids used in the printing processes is fundamental in order to control and improve paper 

behavior in printing operations (Aspler 1983; Garret and Lee 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Shen 

et al. 2000; Wågberg and Westerlind 2000; Hoang et al. 2001; Seppänen et al. 2004; 

Kannangara et al. 2006; Gu et al. 2007). 

In printing techniques where water is used as solvent, such as inkjet printing, the wetting 

properties of the paper are even more important, since ink does not stay at the surface but it 

spreads and is absorbed (Figure 6.1) before drying, naturally affecting print quality (Breda 

2001; Keskitalo 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.1 – Schematic representation of paper-ink interaction. 

 

Figure 6.2 represents a typical wetting system consisting of a liquid drop on a solid surface. 

In such systems, the most important measurable characteristic is the contact angle,? , which 

results of the equilibrium between the adhesive (?SL) and cohesive (?L and ?S) forces 

involved. It is defined as the angle between the tangent to the liquid-gas interface and the 

Time

tangent to the solid interface at the contact point between the three phases (Gennes 1985; 

Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000; Marmur 2006). 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.2 – Contact angle formation on a solid surface according to the Young equation 

 

When a wetting system is created, three distinct situations may be found: no wetting (contact 

angle &gt; 90º), partial wetting (0º &amp;lt;contact angle &amp;lt;90º) or complete wetting (contact angle 

= 0), as illustrated in Figure 6.3 (Gennes 1985; Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; Levlin 

and Söderhjelm 2000; Marmur 2006). 

 

 

 

Figure 6.3 – Representation of the possible wetting situations: (a) non wetting, (b) partial wetting and (c) complete 

wetting. 

 

The main factor ruling wetting is the surface energy (usually called surface tension when 

referring to liquids) of the components involved, which determines how the liquid phase and 

the solid phase interact with each other. (Gennes 1985; Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; 

Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000; Marmur 2006).  

To understand the origin of the surface tension/energy of a material it is necessary to 

examine its surface at a molecular scale. Between the individual molecules there are 

different attraction forces, such as London-Van der Waals, dipole, hydrogen bonds, ionic 

forces or even acid-base interactions. In the interior of the material, each molecule is 

surrounded by others, and a force balance is established. This balance does not exit at the 

surface of the material, and all forces are directed towards the interior, creating the surface 

tension of the material, ruled by the type of attraction between the molecules of the surface 

(Gennes 1985; Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000; Marmur 

2006).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 81 

When the equilibrium between the liquid and the solid is establishes, the balance of forces of 

the system at the contact point between the three phases (Figure 6.2) can be described by 

the well known Young equation: 

???? cos?+= LSLS                                                                                                   (6.1) 

where S?  is the surface free energy of the solid, SL?  is the interfacial free energy between 

the liquid and the solid, L?  is the surface tension of the liquid, and ?  is the contact angle. 

The new interface formed by the contact between the liquid and the solid surface is 

characterized by a given energy that would be the one needed to remove the liquid drop 

from the surface; this energy is called the work of adhesion (Wa ), and is computed by (Brigs 

et al. 1989):   

SLLSWa ??? ?+=                                                                                                     (6.2) 

By combining Equations 6.1 and 6.2 the so called Young-Dupre equation is obtained, which 

relates the work of adhesion with the contact angle value: 

)cos1( ?? +?= LWa                                                                                                    (6.3) 

These relations, based on force balances and thermodynamic definitions, are applicable to 

the interactions occurring in any solid-liquid system and several theories have been 

developed to use them in order to calculate the surface properties of solids, namely the 

surface free energy, ?S. 

 

6.1.2 SURFACE ENERGY CALCULATION THEORIES 

The most used theories to determine the surface energy of solids from contact angle data 

using liquids whose surface tensions are known, are those of Zisman (1960’s); Owens, Wendt, 

Rabel and Kaelbe (OWRK) (1960’s); Fowkes (1950´s) and of van Oss &amp;amp; Good (1980´s) 

(Gennes 1985; Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000; Marmur 

2006) 

 

6.1.2.1 Zisman 

In this theory, at least two liquids with known surface tensions are used and the cosines of the 

measured contact angles are plotted versus the surface tension of the corresponding liquid.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 82 

The straight line obtained is then extrapolated to a value of cosine=1 (?=0º). The 

extrapolated value is called the critical surface tension ( C? ), and corresponds to complete

The Young equation (6.1) then comes: 

CSLS ??? +=                                                                                                              (6.4) 

when 0=SL? , SC ?? =  and thus the critical surface tension equals the solid surface energy. 

This method is of limited use since the linear relationship only applies when the relationship 

between the dispersive and the polar interactions is the same in the solid and in the liquid. 

This practically only occurs under exceptional circumstances as when purely dispersive 

interactive solids and liquids are involved (eg. non-polar solids as polymers as polyethylene 

and Polytetrafluoroethylene).  

 

6.1.2.2 Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble  

This theory distinguishes the dispersive and polar components of the surface energy, which 

are considered independent and additive for all the constituents of the system: 

PD ??? +=                                                                                                              (6.5) 

Thus, for a liquid: 

P
L

D
LL ??? +=                                                                                                             (6.6) 

where ?L is the liquid surface tension, ?LD is the dispersive component of the liquid surface 

tension and ?LP is the polar component of the liquid surface tension. 

 Similarly, for the solid: 

P
S

D
SS ??? +=                                                                                                            (6.7) 

In this theory the polar interactions include Coulomb interactions between permanent and 

induced dipoles.  

As for the work of adhesion, this theory also considers the addition of a dispersive and a 

polar component: 

PD WaWaWa +=                                                                                                        (6.8)

6.1.2.3 Fowkes 

Like in the previous theory, the Fowkes theory also distinguishes the dispersive and non-

dispersive parts of the surface energy. The geometric mean is again used to approximate 

the work of adhesion, but only in the case of the dispersive part. The non dispersive 

interactions, simply denoted as ndI , are not quantified in this theory. Since no information is 

available for ndI , this analysis is only used for liquids having merely dispersive interactions 

with the solid surface under study. 

Considering Equation 6.3 and using the approximation for Wa as:

From Eq. 6.3 and considering 0=ndI , Eq. 6.14 leads to

By plotting ( ) DLL vs ??? cos1 +?  for several liquids, a straight line is obtained from 

whose slope the value of ?SD is computed. 

Similarly to the Zisman theory, only the dispersive interactions are taken into account and thus 

it is a quite restricted theory, since it is only applicable to non-polar systems. 

 

6.1.2.4 van Oss &amp;amp; Good 

In this theory, the interaction between liquid and solid is interpreted as the interaction 

between an acid and a base. It considers that the surface energy can be decomposed into 

LW?  and ab? : 

abLW ??? +=                                                                                                         (6.16) 

here the superscript LW stands for Lifshitz - van der Waals interactions, which include London 

dispersion, Keeson dipole-dipole and Debie induction whereas ab stands for Lewis acid-base 

interactions. 

Once again the geometric mean is used to approximate the several components of the forces 

considered for the work of adhesion:

+?  denoting Lewis acid (electron-acceptor) and ??  Lewis base (electron-donor) character. 

Combining Equation 6.17 with Equation 6.3 leads to:

Equation 6.18 has three unknowns ( LWS? ,

S?  and

(based on graphical solving strategies), it is necessary to establish this equation for at least 

three liquids and solve the corresponding system numerically.

6.1.3 CONTACT ANGLE MEASUREMENTS 

For the measurements of the contact angle, several methods are available such as the 

Wilhelmy, the Washburn or the Sessile drop method. The former two methods are not 

commonly used, mainly because they are indirect methods (Koljonen and Stenius 2005; 

Gurau et al. 2006).  

The sessile drop method is an optical contact angle method, which involves directly measuring 

the contact angle for a drop of liquid resting on a horizontal solid surface (Figure 6.2). 

Traditionally, the measurement of the contact angles was carried out using a goniometer 

eyepiece, being the results quite operator dependent. Nowadays, the measurement is 

performed through video based systems. Sophisticated CCD cameras are used to capture the 

drop image which is stored and subsequently analyzed by the equipment software.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 86 

Great care is however necessary in the position of the base line (phase boundary 

solid/liquid) and of the drop contour line. For the latter, different functions can be used, 

depending upon the software and the computing time available, as described in the next 

section. The test liquids to be used must be free from evaporation during the measurements 

and should correspond to a large range of polar and dispersive components. Table 6.2 lists 

the five test liquids selected for this study (diodomethane, propileneglycol, ethileneglycol, 

formamide and water), as well as their surface tensions and corresponding dispersive and 

polar components.

6.1.3.1 Equipment – OCA 20 

The equipment used for the contact angle measurements was the model OCA 20 from 

Dataphysics, which can also be used for liquids surface tension measurements. 

This equipment, depicted in Figure 6.4, is mainly composed of a light source, a sample 

holder, a dispense system and a CCD camera for image acquisition.  Besides the calculations, 

the software coupled to the equipment, allows the user to control the dispense mechanism 

and the image acquisition (picture or video).

Figure 6.4 – Equipment used for the contact angle measurement - OCA 20 from Dataphysics. 

 

With regard to the contact angle measurements, two distinct types of outputs can be 

achieved: the “static” contact angle, corresponding to the initial equilibrium contact angle, 

and the “dynamic” contact angle, corresponding values of the contact angle obtained by 

measuring the liquid drop contour throughout time. 

Both types of results are achieved using the sessile drop method, which comprises five steps: 

drop dispense, image acquisition, base line detection, drop contour definition and contact 

angle calculation. 

In this method a drop of the liquid under analysis is suspended in the bottom of a capillary. 

The shape of the drop is the result of two forces: the weight and the force that keeps the 

drop in a spherical form in order to minimize its surface (Roe et al. 1967). 

The drop dispense is performed using an appropriate needle for achieving the static or the 

dynamic contact angle results: the liquid drop with a specified volume, dependent on the 

liquid viscosity (Table 6.3), is dispensed over the sample surface.

Regarding image acquisition, the static contact angle measurement is based on a digital 

image, captured by the CCD camera, of the resting drop immediately after contact with the 

solid surface (normally corresponding to a time interval inferior to 3 sec), whereas, for the 

dynamic contact angle, successive images of the liquid drop are acquired during 180 sec 

with a velocity of 2 frames/sec.  

For the static contact angle measurements, at least 10 drops of each of the five test liquids 

(Table 7.2) were used, using at least two stripes of paper from two different sheets, cut in 

the diagonal direction in order to avoid any possible effect of fiber orientation. This 

procedure was repeated for each of the 30 samples. The surface free energy of each 

samples was computed from the average contact angle values (standard deviation of the 

measurements &amp;lt;2º). While for the dynamic contact angle measurements, at least three drops 

were analyzed (water was the test liquid for these measurements), also using at least two 

stripes of paper from two different sheets, cut in the diagonal direction in order to avoid any 

possible effect of fiber orientation and it was ensured the reproducibility of the results 

between tests, by verifying that the same behavior was observed. 

The contact angle calculations depend on the accuracy of the baseline of the drop, 

corresponding to the solid/liquid interface, as well on the drop profile (liquid/air interface). 

Distinct mathematical methods are available for fitting the drop contour, resulting in different 

accuracies and computational times: the height/width method, the Ellipse method and the 

Laplace-Young method. In the height/width method a segment of circle is fitted to the drop 

shape, but for large drops leads to considerable errors and thus it is of limited use.  In the 

ellipse method, the drop contour is approximated by an ellipse whereas in the Laplace-

Young method a line is fitted exactly to the drop contour which requires a longer 

computational time. The ellipse method is thus slightly less accurate but faster, being selected 

when a rapid calculation is necessary (fast absorption by the solid or dynamic contact angle 

measurements). 

Besides the calculation of the contact angle values and corresponding errors associated to 

the measurement, the equipment software also enables the computation of other drop 

properties such as the drop volume, drop base diameter and drop age (associating a time to 

each contact angle value in the dynamic measurements).

6.1.4 TOPOGRAPHY INFLUENCE IN CONTACT ANGLE VALUES 

The influence of the surface texture on contact angle measurements is well recognized and 

has been the subject of various studies (Wenzel 1936; Cassei and Baxter 1944; Cassei 

1948; Wenzel 1949; Swain and Lipowsky 1998; Bico et al. 2002; Lai 2003; Marmur 

2006). This influence results from the fact that, within a measured (geometric) unit area on a 

rough surface, the real surface is actually larger and consequently the intensity of the surface 

energy is greater than in the same (geometric) unit area of a smooth surface. Thus, between 

one liquid and one solid surface with some degree o roughness, two values of the contact 

angle are assigned: the apparent contact angle,? , experimentally determined, and the real 

contact angle, '? , derived from Young equation. 

Reported results show that high surface roughness increases large contact angles (&gt; 90º) and 

decreases small contact angles (&amp;lt;90º), as schematically represented in Figure 6.5 (Levlin 

and Söderhjelm 2000; Bico at al. 2002; Marmur 2006). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.5 – Schematic representation of the surface roughness influence in contact angle values. 

 

The earliest works on the effect of surface roughness on the contact angle measurement are 

attributed to Wenzel (Wenzel 1936; Wenzel 1949) and to Cassei and Baxter (Cassei and 

Baxter 1944; Cassei 1948), who provided different expressions for correcting apparent 

contact angles, based on different average parameters of a rough surface.  

Cassei and Baxter assumed that the liquid forms a composite surface on the rough surface, 

not filling the grooves, as illustrated in Figure 6.6. In this case, the contact area includes a 

liquid-solid interface and a liquid-air interface (Lai 2003).

When a unit area of the surface has a surface fraction, s? , corresponding to the solid-liquid 

interface, with a Young contact angle

? , and a surface fraction, a? , corresponding to the 

air trapped in the hollows with contact angle

according to Cassei, C?  , is  expressed by: 

21 coscoscos YaYsC ????? ?+?=                                                                                 (6.19) 

Applying this equation to a rough surface trapping air in the hollows, leads to

The Wenzel approach assumes that the liquid fills up the grooves of the rough surface 

(Figure 6.7) and considers that for an identically same increase in the free liquid area at the 

upper surface of the drop (liquid-air interface), a greater amount of actual surface is wetted 

under the drop in a rough surface when compared to a smooth surface (Lai 2003).  

 

 

 

Figure 6.7 - Schematic representation of a drop on a rough surface according to Wenzel. 

 

Therefore, according to Wenzel, a distinction must be made between the total (or actual) 

surface and the superficial (or geometrical) surface. Four that a “roughness factor”, R*, 

corresponding to the ratio between the actual surface and the geometric surface, is used in 

the following relation between the apparent ( )?  and the real or Young contact angle ( '? ) : 

'cos*cos ?? ?= R                                                                                                      (6.21)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 91 

In the present work, the Wenzel correction was selected to account for the influence of 

topography on the contact angle measurements for the following reasons: i) the material 

under study is paper, typically hydrophilic in nature, and thus the approach  of Wenzel 

(Figure 6.7) seems a more realistic assumption; ii) the correction factor R* is easier  and more 

accurately determined than the surface fraction s?  defined in the Cassie correction (Swain 

1998; Wågberg and Westerlind 2000; Bico et al. 2002; Lai 2003; Marmur 2006). 

Thus, the contact angle experimentally measured will be corrected using Equation 6.22 with 

the topographical correction factor R given by:

R +=                                                                                                            (6.22) 

here Sdr is the interfacial area ratio obtained by profilometry, as previously defined in 

Section 4.1.1.3 

 

6.1.5 DYNAMIC PARAMETERS 

Besides the measurement of the contact angle as a function of time, the software used also 

provides the values of the drop base diameter and of the drop volume. With this 

information, it is possible to simultaneously evaluate the spreading and absorption 

phenomena by computing the following parameters: 

? Wetting velocity 

? Spreading coefficient 

? Absorption coefficient 

The wetting velocity is calculated, according to the Tappi standard T458 om-89, using the 

contact angle values after 5 and 60 seconds ( 5?  and 60?  respectively):

6.2 RESULTS 

The results obtained for the contact angles measured with the selected liquids, using the 

above described equipment, will be fully analyzed in this section.  

Since inkjet inks are water based, the results obtained for the initial contact angle (known as 

static contact angle) with water are of special relevance to evaluate printing performance. 

Nevertheless, the data collected for the five liquids will be used to determine the surface 

energy and its components. The influence of the various synthetic surface sizing agents as 

well as of their different proportions will also be discussed. Finally, to complement the results, 

the evaluation of the contact angles variation throughout time (dynamic contact angle) will be 

examined. 

Similarly to the procedure adopted in previous chapters, the results were firstly analyzed by 

ANOVA, in order to evaluate the statistical significance of their variability. The results of this 

analysis are presented in Table 6.4.

Water  98.88 1.12 4.01 0.0E+00 1099.36 1.49 

 

From Table 6.4 table, it is possible to observe that, for all the liquids used, the contribution of 

the inter-sample differences is much higher than that corresponding to intra-sample variation. 

This indicates that the differences induced by distinct sizing agents in the various sample 

surfaces are statistically valid. Table 6.4 also shows that the quality of the statistical analysis 

is high as denoted by the extremely low value of P and by the fact of F being much larger 

than Fcritical. Additionally, the values of the reproducibility factor (r) indicate that, for any 

liquid, differences larger than 4º in the contact angle values are statistically significant.  

Having demonstrated the validity of the differences between samples, the next step is to

6.2.1 EFFECT OF TOPOGRAPHY 

As previously mentioned in this chapter, the contact angle values are claimed to be affected 

by the sample surface topography. In order to study this effect the Wenzel correction was 

applied to the measured values, using Equation 6.21, with the corrective factor (R*) 

computed from Equation 6.22, by using the Sdr values measured by Profilometry (Appendix 

C). The values of R* determined for each sample are compiled in Table 6.5. As it can be 

seen, all values are close to unity, indicating that the corrections applied are not much 

relevant.

The differences between the uncorrected values of the contact angle and the corrected 

values are evident in Figure 6.8, in which the results obtained for water (a) and 

diodomethane (b) (respectively the more and the less polar of the liquids tested), are 

plotted.

Figure 6.8 - Comparison of the contact angle values before and after the application of the Wenzel 

correction for water (a) and diodomethane (b). 

 

The analysis of Figure 6.8 indicates that the corrected values are, for all samples, superior to 

the uncorrected ones (as expected from the values of Table 6.5). However, the relative order 

between samples is maintained. These observations are equally valid for the other liquids 

tested (propileneglycol, ethileneghycol and formamide), being the corresponding graphics 

presented in Appendix E. 

The above figures lead to the conclusion that the sample roughness only slightly affects the 

measurements of the contact angle and consequently the derived parameters as total surface 

energy and its components. Since good correlations between corrected and uncorrected 

values were obtained, it can be stated that the above corrections will not alter any conclusion 

undertaken from raw data in studies where the Sdr measurement is not possible to allow the 

correction. 

 

6.2.2 STATIC CONTACT ANGLES 

As mentioned before, the static contact angles correspond to the initial wetting measurements 

which are taken for times approximately equal to 3 seconds from the contact of the drop 

with the sample surface. This time was found to correspond to the average time interval 

necessary for the system to reach equilibrium. Figure 6.9 illustrates, as an example, the 

water contact angle values measured for the samples sized with the lowest amount (i.e. 5%) 

of surface sizing agent. This figure shows that all sized papers are wetted (contact angles

inferior to 90 º) and that the addition of the synthetic sizing agents always increases the 

water contact angle, when compared to the value obtained for the standard sample (where 

only starch is applied). In fact, cationic starch has a hydrophilic nature and thus the reduced 

values of the contact angle with water (&amp;lt;40 º) are perfectly natural. The increase in paper 

surface hydrophobicity as a result of adding the sizing agents was also expected regarding 

the copolymers composition (Section 3.1).

Figure 6.9 - Contact angle values with water, measured for the reference samples and the samples sized with 

the addition of 5% of synthetic surface sizing agent. 

 

Nonetheless, it is evident that some samples exhibit values close to that of the reference 

sample (e. g. StS3 and StS9) whereas others present values close to the hydrophobicity 

barrier (e.g. StS4-05). The latter are, in principle, not favorable for printing performance 

with based water inks. However, it is important to stress that the final printing quality is the 

result of the balance of a set of properties and can not be predicted only by the analysis of 

the contact angle measured for water. 

A detailed explanation of these differences will be given when discussing the results 

obtained for the surface energies and its components since these are the parameters that 

indeed condition the values of the contact angle. Figure 6.10 presents the average values of 

the contact angle measured with the five liquids tested and for all the concentrations of the 

sizing agents (5 %, 10 % and 20 % w/w).  

Comparing all the plots, it can be concluded that the contact angle values exhibit in general 

the following trend: 

? water &gt; ? formamide &gt; ? ethileneglycol &gt; ? propileneglycol &gt; ? diodomethane

Figure 6.10 – Influence of the amount of the sizing agent on the contact angle values measured with the 

liquids tested (water, formamide, ethileneghycol, propileneglycol and diodomethane).

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 97 

This sequence was somehow expected since the polarity of the liquids tested decreases in the 

same way (water is the most polar whereas diodomethane is non-polar), and the size agents 

are mainly non-polar compounds. 

However, there is one sizing agent, agent S5 (quaternary ditallow methyl epoxypropyl 

ammonium), that presents a unique behavior:  as the polarity of the liquid decreases, the 

contact angle consistently increases (reaching a remarkably high contact angle value, 

relatively to the others, for the diodomethane).  This indicates that this surface sizing agent 

has a much larger influence on the surface properties ruling the dispersive interactions than 

on those ruling the polar interactions. 

With regard to the effect of increasing the amount of copolymer (5, 10 and 20 %), all types 

of tendencies can be observed, as illustrated in Figure 6.10: the contact angle increases with 

the amount of the sizing agent, the contact angle decreases as the amount of the sizing agent 

increases or, an inflexion point is detected.  

The reason why the increase of the surface sizing concentration originates these distinct types 

of variation is probably related with the arrangement of the copolymers molecules at the 

sample surface, i.e., molecule orientation and the availability of their functional groups for 

interacting with the various liquids. This point will be discussed in the next section, together 

with the results of the surface energies.    

 

6.2.3 SURFACE ENERGIES 

Surface free energy and the corresponding dispersive and polar components were 

determined, according to OWRK method, as describe in Section 6.1.3. The knowledge of 

these parameters is essential to assess the impact of the various sizing agents on the sample 

surface properties. The results obtained are plotted in Figure 6.11, while the numerical 

values are listed in Appendix E.

Figure 6.11 - Graphical representation of the polar and dispersive components of the surface energy for the 

various samples tested. 

 

As it can be seen, the surface free energy of the paper samples is mainly dispersive. 

Moreover, the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the cationic starch tends to 

decrease the total surface energy mainly due to the decrease of its polar component rather 

than the dispersive one, leading to more hydrophobic surfaces, as can be more clearly 

visible in Figure 6.12 where a star diagram shows the normalized values, relative to the 

standard sample.

This effect was expected, since the surface sizing agents added are mainly non-polar 

compounds. Since the major effect of the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents is 

detected in the polar component of the surface energy, the values of this component will be 

analyzed in more detail in Figure 6.13, regarding the influence of the amount of the sizing 

agent.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.13 – Polar component of the surface free energy for all the samples tested.  

 

As Figure 6.13 shows, the addition of the various synthetic agents significantly reduces the 

polar component of the surface energy, from 20 to 95 %, depending on the type of 

compound as well as its amount. Concerning the concentration of the sizing agent, and 

similarly to Figure 6.10, all types of behaviors are observed, being the most common the 

existence of an inflection point for the intermediate quantity of the surface sizing agent. As 

mentioned above, this might be a consequence of the distinct molecular orientations of these 

agents at the surface of the paper samples.  

For instance, samples StS2 and StS8 (that include co-styrene-maleic anhydride and co-

styrene-butyl acrylate, respectively) present a consistent decrease in the values of the polar 

component with the sizing agent concentration, suggesting that the molecules of these co-

polymers are oriented at the paper surface with the styrene monomer towards the exterior. 

On the contrary, the oxygen containing monomers are pointing inwards, i.e. towards the 

fibrous matrix, probably as result of some attraction from the -OH groups of cellulose. 

However, when the copolymer concentration is increased from 10 to 20 %, the decrease in 

the polar component is much more attenuated for surface sizing agent S8 (co-styrene-butyl 

acrylate). This may be because, for the intermediate concentration, their molecules (larger 

than the ones of co-styrene-maleic anhydride) nearly fill the available sites. Presumably if 



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 101 

the amount of this sizing agent would be further increased, the molecules would re-orient and 

the polar component would again increase. 

This is probably what happened with samples St S3 and StS9 whose polar components 

exhibit a minimum for 10 % incorporation. Regarding the surface sizing agent S3 (co-

acrylonitrile-acrylate), for the lowest concentration (5 %), the less polar nitrile group is most 

likely oriented outwards. As concentration increases (to 10 %), all the available sites are 

nearly filled. A further increase in concentration leads not only to the accumulation of the 

molecules but also to their reorientation. The affinity of their functional groups makes that the 

acrylate group (more polar) reorient outwards leading to an increase in the polar character 

of the surface. A similar explanation can be advanced for the sizing agent S9 (co-styrene-

acrylate): initially the styrene monomer is the one oriented outwards but the increase of the 

co-polymer amount after saturation of the available sites originates a re-orientation of the 

molecule and ultimately a new increase of the polar component. However, in this case, the 

polar component variations are more pronounced than those found for sample StS3, most 

certainly because the molecule of compound S9 is larger. 

Similar justifications can be produced for the behaviors detected for the remaining surface 

sizing agents, being the only difference the critical amount needed to change the molecules 

orientation. This amount is probably related to the particle size of the copolymer, as 

mentioned above, but might also be related to other factors such as, the penetration of the 

surface sizing agent or the surface tension of the liquids.  

Since, as Figure 6.12 indicates, the major impact of the surface sizing agents on surface 

energetics seems to be derived from contribution of the polar component,  the contact angle 

was plotted as a function of the surface free energy the ( PS? ). Figure 6.14 shows the 

relationship obtained with water while Table 6.6 gathers the results achieved for the 

remaining liquids tested.

As it can be seen, a good linear correlation is obtained for water, but this correlation 

deteriorates as the liquid polarity increases. This is an important observation to register, since 

the inkjet inks are water based, and consequently polar liquids. 

 

6.2.4 DYNAMIC CONTACT ANGLES  

In addition to the static contact angle measured immediately after the equilibrium between 

phases has been reached, the evolution of the contact angle with water throughout time 

(dynamic contact angle) was investigated. The ultimate purpose of this study is to anticipate 

the final printing performance. The measurement of the dynamic contact angle corresponds 

to the analysis of successive pictures captured by the CCD camera approximately every 0.5 

sec., during 180 seconds.  

As mentioned before, water was the test liquid chosen for this type of study, not only 

because it is the liquid currently used for most wetting evaluations but also because the 

printing technology that will be further applied to evaluate print quality is inkjet, which uses 

water based inks.

From each measurement an output in table form is produced by the equipment software, that 

includes the drop age value (corresponding to the time interval between the initial 

equilibrium of the drop with the surface (t=0) and the instant of the measurement (t=t)), the 

contact angle measured at time t, the corresponding error of each measurement and the 

corresponding drop base diameter and drop volume. Table 6.7 presents, as an example, an 

extract of this type of table.

As can be easily perceived from the example presented above, this type of measurements 

generates very extensive tables, and the accuracy of the contact angle values measured is 

verified by the reduced values of the measuring error. 

The contact angle values are used to calculate the wetting velocity (defined as the difference 

between the contact angle measured at 5 and at 60 seconds (Equation 6.23) and to 

evaluate the variation profiles determined for the contact angle as well as for the drop

(evaluated from the drop volume profile).  

It should be stressed that in this text the results presented correspond to the average values 

obtained for (at least) three independent measurements whereas the results presented in 

graphical form correspond to an individual measurements representative of the behavior 

detected for the sample under analysis. 

The statistical validity of the wetting velocity results is confirmed by ANOVA, as depicted in

The average wetting velocity (WV) values obtained for each sample are presented in Table 

6.9. To facilitate the analysis the results are divided into four groups depending upon the 

value of the wetting velocity: wetting velocities smaller than 0.1º/sec, wetting velocities 

between 0.1 and 0.2º/sec, wetting velocities between 0.2 and 0.3º/sec and wetting 

velocities larger than 0.3º/sec.

As this table shows, most of the sizing formulations lead to water wetting velocities smaller 

than that of the standard sample (St), which is 0.23º/sec. However, it should be stressed that, 

regarding the wetting velocity, it is not easily obvious which values should be considered 

“large” or “small”, since the optimum wetting velocity value for a given paper also depends 

upon absorption and spreading phenomena. Concerning P&amp;amp;W papers it is usually accepted 

that relatively small wetting velocities are beneficial for inkjet printing performance, if 

accompanied with a predominance of absorption over spreading. However, small wetting 

values do not necessarily mean better printing performances. In fact, very small wetting 

velocities may indicate that the paper has no capacity to absorb the ink solvent, leading to 

bad printing performance.

Analyzing the performance of the standard sample, in terms of dynamic contact angle 

(Figure 6.15) it is obvious that the water contact angles decreases abruptly during the first 

15 seconds and beyond that, presents a much slower reduction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.15 – Water contact angle variation for sample St, normalized relatively to the initial value (t=0) 

 

This behavior is a consequence of the drop spreading and absorption on the paper surface, 

respectively illustrated by the variation throughout time of the drop base diameter and of 

the drop volume, Figure 6.16 (a) and Figure 6.16 (b), respectively. 

 

Figure 6.16 – Normalized (relatively to the initial values (t=0)) drop base diameters and drop volume values 

for sample St. 

 

As it is clear from this figure, the variation of these parameters is also very accentuated in 

the first 15 seconds. Moreover, the evaluation of the drop volume shows an anomalous 

increase with time. This is unexpected, since the drop is supposed to be gradually absorbed 

by the paper surface thus leading to a decrease in the drop total volume.  This odd fact is 

probably the result of an excessively high spreading together with a too fast absorption of 

the drop by the paper fibrous matrix, originating paper swelling. This is (wrongly)

interpreted by the image detecting system as an increase in drop volume. Obviously this 

behavior is not adequate for printing purposes, indicating, as expected, that the standard 

sample needs further treatment. 

In fact, as Table 6.9 shows, the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the starch 

suspension usually leads to a decrease in the wetting velocities. However, this decrease can 

not be analyzed independently of the evaluation of the drop base diameter and volume, as 

explained before. 

The profiles determined for each sample, regarding the normalized contact angle, drop 

base diameter and drop volume, presented in Appendix E, show that in general the addition 

of a synthetic surface sizing agent does not originate that unusual increase in drop diameter. 

Moreover, no significant swelling was observed for any of these samples. This is valid either 

for wetting velocities larger and smaller than that of the standard sample (0.23º/sec). It can 

then be concluded that the sizing agents positively influence the wetting process. Figure 6.17 

shows a typical result, obtained for sample StS4-05, that exhibits a wetting velocity similar 

to that of the reference sample (0.27º/sec).

In this figure, a gradual decrease of both the normalized contact angle and the drop volume 

can be noticed. Additionally, no swelling effects were observed at the paper surface. Similar 

findings were detected for the majority of the samples, confirming that the synthetic surface 

sizing agents have a controlling action over the dynamics of the wetting phenomenon. 

The influence of the concentration of the sizing agent will be studied by analyzing the 

dynamic contact angle profiles of different samples.  

Let us take, for example, the case of the sizing agent S2, co-styrene-maleic anhydride. The 

graphic of Figure 6.13 indicates that the polar component of the surface free energy 

decreases as the incorporation percentage of S2 increases. As explained, this is probably 

because the styrene molecules are always turned outwards, that is, oriented towards the air 

interface. The results achieved for the dynamic contact angle measurements are also in 

agreement with this assumption, since an increase in the copolymer amount also results in a 

progressively lower wetting velocity: 0.20, 0.10 and 0.04º/sec, respectively for 5%, 10% 

and 20 % of S2.  

The normalized contact angle as a function of time is plotted in Figure 6.18. From this plot, it 

is evident that the higher the percentage of S2 the slower is the profile slope. Nonetheless, 

for the first few seconds, the distinction between the curves is not so obvious.

Figure 6.18 – Normalized contact angle for samples sized with the synthetic surface sizing agent S2. 

 

The decrease in the contact angle measured with water when only 5% of S2 is added results 

from the fact that the hydrophobicity of the styrene is not enough to maintain the value of the 

initial contact angle. Thus, after the initial wetting, the oxygen atoms of the maleic anhydride 

monomer are accessible to the water drop, originating the profile of Figure 6.18 for this 

concentration. When the amount of S2 is increased, the accessibility of the oxygen atoms is

delayed, and the styrene mainly rules the wetting process, and thus no significant decrease in 

the contact angle occurs. However, and as mentioned before, the analysis of the dynamic 

contact angle should not be made independently of the drop behavior in terms of drop base 

diameter (spreading) and drop volume (absorption). These results are presented in Figure 

6.19  

 

Figure 6.19 – Normalized drop base diameter and drop volume for the samples sized with the synthetic 

surface sizing agent S2. 

 

As this figure shows, the decrease in the wetting velocity of sample StS2-05 is found to be 

due to high absorption, indicating that the addition of 5% of sizing agent is not sufficient to 

decrease that absorption. On the contrary, the addition of 20% of S2 seems excessive, since 

the absorption is negligible and thus almost no contact angle variation is detected. The 

optimum sizing amount for this surface sizing agent seems to be above 5% and below 20%. 

Since the sizing agent S2 is similar in composition to sizing agent S4 (the main difference 

being the monomers ratio styrene/maleic anhydride that is 3/1 in the case of S2 and 2/1 in 

the case of S4, (Table 3.2), it was found interesting to compare the dynamic performance of 

these two copolymers. Figure 6.20 illustrates the variation of contact angle for the three 

concentrations tested (5, 10 and 20%) of both styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers.

Figure 6.20 – Comparison of the normalized water contact angle values of the sizing agents S2 and S4 for 

the three different incorporation percentages (5%, 10 % and 20%). 

 

These graphs show that:  

i) for the lower concentration, both co-polymers exhibit practically coincident profiles, 

corresponding the sample StS2-05 to a wetting velocity of 0.20º/sec and sample StS4-05 to 

0.27º/sec;  

ii) for the intermediate concentration distinct profiles are obtained, corresponding that of S4 

to a higher wetting velocity (0.22º/sec for StS4-10 and 0.10º/sec for StS2-10);  

iii) for the highest concentration, the difference between the dynamic contact angles of both 

samples is decreased but shows the same trend: wetting velocities of 0.16º/sec and of 

0.04º/sec were determined for sample StS4-20 and StS2-20, respectively.  

The lower wetting velocities of S2 compared with those of S4 for the same copolymer 

concentration were expected since the amount of styrene is smaller in the sample StS4. 

The spreading and absorption profiles of these samples are compared in Figure 6.21.

Regarding these profiles, the samples sized with the sizing agent S4 are more consistent with 

the corresponding contact angle profiles, exhibiting a continuous increase in the drop base 

diameter and a decrease in the drop volume. For 20% of incorporation, the contact angle 

variation is caused almost only by absorption. This suggests that, most probably, the sample 

StS4-20 will be the one with better inkjet printing performance among these.  

Figure 6.22 and Figure 6.23 illustrate the dynamic behavior of the samples sized with the 

sizing agent S9 that also contains styrene (co-styrene-acrylate, Table 3.2).

Figure 6.23 - Normalized drop base diameter and drop volume for the samples sized with the synthetic

The analysis of the surface energy results (Section 6.2.3) suggested that, for 5 and 10% of 

incorporation of this sizing agent, the styrene groups are the ones oriented outwards. 

However, at 20% of incorporation, a re-orientation of the molecule takes place and the 

acrylate groups are the ones facing the air interface. The dynamic behaviors depicted in 

Figure 6.22 and Figure 6.23 also show similar profiles for the lower concentrations (5 % and 

10 %) and a distinctive performance for 20 % of incorporation. The latter corresponds to a

considerable drop absorption that is certainly caused by the OH groups of the acrylate, 

which are now more accessible for interaction with the water, thus confirming the above 

assumption.  

Since the surface sizing agent S9 is similar to S1 (Table 3.2), the only difference being the 

molecular configuration (Figure 3.3), it is interesting to compare their dynamic behaviors 

(Figure 6.24). 

 

Figure 6.24 - Comparison of the normalized contact angle values at each incorporation percentage for the 

sizing agents S9 and S1. 

 

As shown in this figure, when the concentration of the sizing agent increases, the dynamic 

contact angle profiles invert their relative positions: for the lower concentration the decay of 

the contact angle variation of the sample containing S9 is more attenuated than that 

containing S1; for the intermediate incorporation, both profiles coincide; and for the highest 

concentration, sample containing S9 exhibits a more steep variation. Interestingly, as Table 

6.9 reports, the highest values of the wetting velocity, 0.21º/sec, were achieved for the 

samples StS1-05 and StS9-20. 

This indicates that the accessibility of the OH groups does not change significantly with the 

increase of the incorporation percentage, and thus the wetting velocity and the contact angle 

variation decrease with the sizing agent increase. 

In the particular case of the 5% incorporation, the difference detected between the profiles 

of the samples containing S9 and S1 can be associated to the fact that the molecules of 

styrene, being more close together in the sizing agent S1 Figure 3.3, and its effect is thus less 

noted when a small amount is used. 

Identical analyses can be made for other samples. In general, the sample performance in 

terms of wetting behavior is in agreement with the results obtained for the surface energy, as 

expected. However, the accessibility of hydrophilic groups, in particular OH also affects the

sizing agents at the paper surface is of great importance since it affects the accessibility of 

the hydrophilic groups.

7 INVERSE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY (IGC) 

IGC derives from the conventional gas chromatography (GC), which is a simple technique 

used to separate and identify solutes in a mixture, based on the fact that each solute has a 

particular interaction with the stationary phase and thus will travel through the column at 

different rates. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) uses this fact to study of the stationary 

phase instead of the mobile phase: by using a series of solutes (probes) of well known 

physicochemical characteristics, it is possible to extract valuable information about the 

packing material of the column.  (Figure 7.1) (Gutierrez et al. 1999; Kunaver et al. 2004; 

Carvalho et al. 2005; Santos and Guthrie 2005; Wang and Sain 2007). 

Figure 7.1 – Schematic representation of conventional gas chromatography (GC) and inverse gas 

chromatography (IGC) analysis. 

 

After the introduction of IGC in 1967, the application of this technique has grown rapidly, 

being frequently used for the surface characterization of organic and inorganic materials 

such as polymers, industrial fibers, wood and pulp fibers, composites, coatings, pigments, 

catalysts as well as particles, glass beads or chemicals. The quantity of related publications 

has been permanently increasing, covering applications in many fields, like pharmaceutical, 

ceramics, constructions, pulp and paper or transports (Pyda et al. 1993; Cordeiro et al.

In the particular case of pulp and paper, the use of IGC to evaluate the properties of fibers 

and pulps is common, and several studies covering themes such as the surface energetics of 

cellulose fibers properties, or the effects the cooking and bleaching processes on surface and 

strength properties can be found in the literature  (Felix and Gatenholm 1993; Belgacem et 

al. 1995; Böras et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1998; Shen et al. 1998; Shen and Parker 1999; van 

Asten et al. 2000; Belgacem 2000; Aquino et al. 2003; Shakeri and Tabar-Haidar 2004; 

Carvalho et al. 2005). However, the use of IGC to study paper surface and, in particular, its 

interaction with ink is more recent and is still  matter of development (Shen et al. 2000; 

Santos et al. 2001; Moutinho et al. 2007a; Moutinho et al. 2008a). 

The application of IGC to the surface characterization of paper samples enables the 

evaluation of the dispersive component of the surface energy arising from London and Van-

der-Waals forces as well as its variation with temperature. Moreover, it also enables the 

analysis of the surface acid-base character according to the Lewis concept (i.e., ability to 

accept and donate electrons) (Gutierrez et al. 1999; Carvalho et al. 2005; Santos and 

Guthrie 2005; Wang and Sain 2007; Aquino et al. 2003). It is in this context that IGC will 

be used in the present work. 

The theoretical principles of IGC are a widely discussed matter and many studies can be 

found in the literature regarding the subject (Belgacem et al. 1995; Cordeiro et al. 1995; Liu 

et al. 1998; Shen and Parker 1999; van Asten et al. 2000; Belgacem 2000; Wålinder and 

Gardner 2000; Aquino et al. 2003; Planinšek and Buckton 2003; Kunaver et al. 2004; 

Shakeri and Tabar-Haidar 2004; Carvalho et al. 2005;  Santos and Guthrie 2005;  Wang 

and Sain 2007) thus, only brief considerations, useful to better understand the work, will be 

presented here.

7.1 THEORY 

In an IGC analysis, an inert carrier gas elutes a minute quantity of a probe molecule through 

a column packed with the material under study. Due to the interactions between the 

stationary and the mobile phase, the probe molecules are retained for a certain time (tr), 

known as the retention time, which is used to calculate the net retention volume (Vn), 

according to:  

JFttVn r ???= )( 0                                                                                                     (7.1) 

where t0 is the dead retention time of a marker probe, F is the carrier gas flow rate and J is 

the correction factor for gas compressibility, calculated according to Equation 7.2:

Pi and P0 are the inlet and outlet pressures of the carrier gas, respectively. 

Taking into account the fact of the experiments being undertaken at infinite dilution 

conditions, the free energy of adsorption of the probes on the stationary phase surface per 

mole (?G) can be determined from the retention volume (Vn) according to Equation 7.3: 

1)ln( CVnTRG +??=??                                                                                              (7.3) 

where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute column temperature and C1 is a constant 

which depends upon the chromatographic column. 

Considering that the dispersive and specific components, ?GD and ?GS, respectively, are 

additive (Equation 7.4), as suggested by Fowkes in 1987, Equation 7.3 can be rewritten as:  

SD GGG ?+?=?                                                                                                       (7.4) 

Considering Equation 7.3, the above equation leads to 

1)ln()( CVnTRGG
SD +??=?+??                                                                               (7.5) 

On the other hand, the free energy of adsorption can also be related to the work of 

adhesion (Wa) according to Equation 7.6: 

WaaNG ??=??                                                                                                        (7.6)

  Isabel M. T. Moutinho 120 

where N is the Avogadro’s number and a is the cross-sectional area of the probe to be 

tested.  

According to Fowkes, The work of adhesion can be considered as the sum of a dispersive 

(WaD) and a specific (WaS) component: 

S
a

D
a WWWa +=                                                                                                          (7.7) 

Following this principle, the interactions evaluated by IGC are the dispersive interactions, 

through the determination of the dispersive component of the surface energy, and the 

specific interactions, in this case through the determination of the acidic and basic constants, 

as described in the following Sections (7.1.1 and 7.1.2). 

 

7.1.1 DISPERSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SURFACE FREE ENERGY  

When non-polar probes are used (n-alkane series), the interactions are purely of dispersive 

nature, and Equation 7.7 can be reduced to: 

DWaWa =                                                                                                                 (7.8) 

As presented in Chapter 6, WaD can be approximated by the geometric mean of the 

surface free energy/tension of the phases involved: 

( ) aDLDSDa WW =?= ??2                                                                                              (7.9) 
where ?SD and ?LD are the dispersive components of the solid surface energy and of the 

liquid surface tension, respectively. Equations 7.3 and 7.6 can then be combined so that: 

)ln()()(2 2

By plotting R·T·ln(Vn) vs 2·N·a·(?LD)1/2 for a homologous alkane series (Figure 7.2), a straight 

line is obtained usually referred to as the reference line. The slope of the reference line 

leads to the determination of ?SD for a given temperature.

7.1.2 ACID-BASE CHARACTER  

In the late 70´s, it was proposed by Fowkes that the totality of specific interactions may be 

interpreted as Lewis acid-base forces, and thus that the dispersive forces and acid-base 

interactions are the primary forces operating across the interface. This approach has been 

later supported by experimental results. 

The acid-base interactions are analyzed through the net retention volume measured using 

polar probes. In order to obtain the acidic (Ka) and the basic (Kb) parameters of the solid 

surface, the vertical deviations from the reference line for each polar probe, are quantified, 

allowing the estimation of the specific component of free energy (?GS) as: 

)ln()ln( Re f
S VnTRVnpTRG ?????=??                                                                       (7.11) 

where Vn,Ref is the retention volume established by the n-alkanes reference line, and Vnp is the 

retention volume of the polar probes.  The adhesion work between the polar probes tested 

and the paper samples (Was) can be obtained from the specific free energy (Eq.7.6) as:

In order to relate these concepts with the acid-base interactions, which according to Fowkes 

can be considered as the origin of all specific interactions, it is necessary to make use of the 

following thermodynamic definitions: 

ABABAB STHG ????=?                                                                                            (7.13)

energy, ?H  the enthalpy of adsorption, ?S is the entropy of adsorption, Ka is the acidic 

constant, DN is the Gutmann’s donor number, Kb is the basic constant and AN is the 

Gutmann’s acceptor number. 

Experiments are undertaken at different temperatures in order to determine the enthalpy 

(?HS) and the entropy (?SS) of adsorption from the plots of ?GS/T vs 1/T for each probe 

tested, using Equation 7.13 in the following form:

7.1.3 EQUIPMENT - DANI GC 1000 

In this work, the Chromatograph DANI GC 1000 (Figure 7.5) was used to perform the inverse 

gas chromatography measurements for all the samples produced (31).

The analysis consists in the determination of retention times followed by an adequate 

mathematical treatment. The retention times correspond to the time that each gaseous probe 

is delayed by the solid stationary phase (paper sample) under analysis.  

A typical IGC analysis is undertaken in three steps: sample preparation, sample conditioning 

and analysis. 

Sample preparation began by filling the IGC column. For that approximately 2 g of the 

paper sample was cut into small pieces of approximately 2×2 mm2 (Figure 7.6 (a)) and 

subsequently packed into a stainless steel column, 0.5 m long and 0.4 mm ID. To facilitate this

operation and to ensure the quality of the packing, in terms of homogeneity, a vacuum pump 

was used as illustrated in Figure 7.6 (b). Finally, the column packed with the paper sample as 

the stationary phase is folded (Figure 7.6 (c)) before being placed and fixed in the 

equipment. The packed columns were conditioned for approximately 12 h under a helium 

flow before the beginning of each analysis. Similar experimental procedures have also been 

adopted by other authors (Cordeiro et al. 1995; Shen et al. 1998; Santos et al. 2001; 

Carvalho et al. 2005; Santos and Guthrie 2005).

packed into the IGC column; (b) Experimental assembly used for packing the columns; (c) ICG column packed 

and folded, ready to be introduced into the equipment. 

 

The experiments were carried out at temperatures between 35 and 60ºC using 5ºC steps. 

This temperature range was selected since it was not possible to operate the equipment 

below 35ºC, and above 60ºC, there was the risk of damaging the paper surface by a 

prolonged exposure to such high temperatures. The injector and detector were set at 180 

and 200ºC respectively, in order to keep an adequate temperature difference (a minimum 

difference of 20ºC between the injector and detector is desirable) and simultaneously to 

maintain both temperatures higher that the maximum vaporization temperature of the 

probes. Helium was used as carrier gas and to each sample tested the flow was selected to 

ensure that neither absorption nor diffusion of the probes would occur inside the column 

(preliminary tests were undertaken for this purpose). Small amounts of each probe vapor (&lt;1 

µl) were injected into the carrier gas flow to ensure that the experiments were carried out at 

infinite dilution. 

The retention times were determined by measuring the electrical signal with a Flame 

Ionization Detector (FID) located at the end of the IGC column.

The n-alkane probes used to determine the dispersive component of the surface energy 

were: n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane and n-decane. To evaluate the acid/base 

properties, the polar probes used were: dichloromethane (DCM, CH2Cl2, acidic), 

trichloromethane (TCM, CHCl3, acidic), acetone (Acet, C8H6O, amphoteric), ethyl acetate 

(ETA, CH3COOCH2CH3, amphoteric) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, C4H8O, basic). Natural gas 

(83.7 % methane) was used to determine the dead retention volume. 

The relevant characteristics of the probes used, such as the dispersive component (?LD) of the 

surface tension, molecular surface area (a), Gutmann’s modified acceptor number (AN*), (DN) 

and Lewis character are gathered in Table 7.1.

At least three determinations of the retention time were carried out for each of the eleven 

probes (methane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane and n-decane, trichloromethane, 

dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate,  and tetrahydrofuran), for six different 

temperatures: 35ºC, 40ºC, 45ºC, 50ºC, 55ºC and 60ºC.

7.2 RESULTS 

Figure 7.7 shows peaks obtained from a typical IGC analysis together with the 

corresponding retention times determined by the Clarity software, coupled to the 

chromatograph.  

 

 

 

 

Figure 7.7 – Exemplification of the output undertaken after the injection of a probe into the IGC column: peak 

obtained for sample StS3-10 after the injection of C7 at 45ºC. 

 

For the 31 different paper samples tested in this study, a total of at least 200 peaks were 

obtained, corresponding to six temperatures per sample, eleven probes per temperature 

and at least three injections per probe. The calculations and subsequent analysis presented in 

this chapter correspond to average values of the retention time of each pair probe/sample. 

First of all, the analysis will be focused on the retention time values, in order to detect 

generic tendencies and behaviors. Afterwards the dispersive components of the surface free 

energies and the acid-base character of the paper surface computed from those retention 

time values will be analyzed.  

The effect of the temperature as well as the addition of different synthetic surface sizing 

agents on the dispersive component of the sample surface energy will also be evaluated. 

These results will be compared to those obtained by the contact angle measurements. Finally, 

the acid-base character of the samples will be analyzed by computing the corresponding Ka 

and Kb values. 

As in previous chapters, the statistical validity of the values of the retention time was 

confirmed by ANOVA. Although the corresponding results are presented in Appendix F (due 

to the large quantity of data), sorted by probe and temperature, it should be pointed out 

that the quality of the statistical analysis is ensured by the values of the parameters P, F and 

Fcritical (P values between 1.32E-64 and 1.08E-06 and F values much higher than the ones of 

Fcritical in all cases). For all the probes tested, the variation registered is much more due to 

inter-samples differences than to intra-samples differences (values between 0.02% and

41.18% for intra samples variation and from 58.82%  to 99.98% for inter-samples 

variation; the large majority of the cases corresponds to inter samples variations above 

90%). This indicates that the retention times, and consequently the chemical properties 

derived from them, clearly allow the differentiation between the samples. The same was 

found for the contact angle results (Chapter 6), but the opposite was observed for the results 

of profilometry (Chapter 4) and porosimetry (Chapter 5), leading to the conclusion that the 

major effect of the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents is more evident in the 

chemical, rather than in the physical,  properties of the papers surface. 

 

7.2.1 RETENTION TIMES 

Tables with the average retention times determined for all the samples can be consulted in 

Appendix F. Here, the data analysis will be supported by the plots considered more 

relevant.  

Figure 7.8 represents, as an example, the retention times obtained for the n-alkanes tested 

at 35ºC. This plot illustrates the typical behavior of all samples at all the temperature tested 

and was randomly selected from the remaining plots, which are depicted in Appendix F.

samples with 10% of the different surface sizing agents. 

 

This graph shows that the retention times of the non-polar probes increase with the weight 

and size of the molecules:  tr(C6) &amp;lt;tr(C7) &amp;lt;tr(C8)&amp;lt;tr(C9) &amp;lt;tr(C10).

This was expected since both these properties rule the majority of the interactions with the 

stationary phase when non-polar probes are used.  

A similar plot for the polar probes is presented in Figure 7.9. Although less strong, an 

increasing tendency of tr with the electron acceptance ability of the probes can still be 

noticed:  tr(DCM) &amp;lt;tr(TCM) &amp;lt;tr(Acet) &amp;lt;tr(THF) &amp;lt;tr(ETA).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 7.9 - Retention times obtained at 35ºC with the polar probes for the reference sample and for the 

samples with 10% of the different surface sizing agents  

 

In this case, since the probe molecules are not neutral, the retention time values are related, 

to the modified acceptor number (AN*) value, generally decreasing with this number, as 

depicted in Figure 7.10 for samples S1 , S3, S5 and S7 at 45ºC. The same trend was found 

for the other synthetic surface sizing agents at all temperatures.

Regarding the influence of the temperature, Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12 reveal that the 

increase of the temperature leads, in general, to a decrease in the retention times. Moreover, 

the higher the temperature the smaller the differences between the retention times of the 

samples for the same probe. Additionally, the difference between the distinct probes, for the 

same sample, is also smaller. 

 

Figure 7.11 – Effect of temperature on the retention times measured with the non-polar probes. 

 

Figure 7.12 - Effect of temperature on the retention times measured with the polar probes. 

 

The reduction in the variation amplitude of the retention times measured for all the samples 

(31), caused by an increase in temperature, can be better observed in Figure 7.13 for a 

non-polar probe (C9) and in Figure 7.14 for a polar probe (ETA). Both probes were selected 

merely to illustrate this fact and are representative of the results obtained for all the probes 

tested.

7.2.2 DISPERSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SURFACE ENERGY 

As mentioned before, from the retention times determined for the n-alkane series at different 

temperatures, the corresponding value of the dispersive component of the surface free 

energy (?SD) can be computed.  

Figure 7.15 shows the values of ?SD obtained for the reference sample and for the samples 

sized with 5% incorporation of the different synthetic sizing agents as a function of 

temperature.

Figure 7.15 – Influence of the temperature on the dispersive component of the surface free energy, for the 

samples sized with 5% incorporation of synthetic sizing agents (the straight line indicates the behavior of 

sample St). 

 

This figure shows a tendency for linear decrease of ?SD with temperature.  Identical trends 

were found for the remaining the samples, sized with 10% and 20% incorporations 

(Appendix F). This is in agreement with results previously reported by other authors, 

regarding pulp and paper studies (Shen et al. 1996; Santos et al. 2001; Carvalho et al. 

2005). This decrease with temperature is associated to an entropic contribution of the surface 

free energy.  

Also regarding the magnitude of the ?SD values, it should be stressed that similar values can 

be found in previously published studies, which reported  ?SD values of 24.6 mN/m  at 50ºC 

for an office paper, and 33.4 mN/m at 40ºC for handsheets of Eucalyptus globulus pulp 

(Santos et al. 2001; Carvalho et al. 2005). 

The quality of the linear correlation between ?SD and T is very good for all the samples (with 

the exception of sample StS1-05), as summarized in Table 7.2. Therefore, these correlations 

can be used for the calculation of ?sD (mN/m) at temperatures that were not tested.

StS10-20 ?SD = - 0.25 · T(ºC)   + 50.40 0.99 

 

It should be mentioned that the values of the temperature coefficients (d?SD/dT), are also in 

agreement with those reported in literature for an office paper, of - 0.35 mN/(m·K) in the 

range 50-90ºC and for amorphous cellulose, of - 0.36 mN/(m·K) in the range 50-100ºC 

(Santos et al. 2001). 

Concerning the effect of the addition the synthetic surface sizing agents to the cationic starch, 

it was found that, in general, higher  ?SD values are obtained for the sizing blends than for 



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 133 

the reference sample (St). The same was detected in the contact angle measurements, as 

reported in Chapter 6. 

This indicates that the sizing agent generally increases the surface ability to establish 

dispersive interactions, probably due to the higher surface tension of the sizing agents 

compared to that of the cationic starch (Table 3.3).  

However, in addition to the surface tension effect, the size and the spatial orientation of the 

molecules of sizing agents at the paper surface can also influence its ability to establish 

dispersive interactions.  

Concerning the influence of the type and of the concentration of the sizing agent, different 

behaviors were detected. Let us examine for instance the results of Figure 7.16 that shows 

the variation of ?SD with the concentration of the sizing agent S2 (co-styrene-maleic 

anhydride), together with value of the reference sample, for different temperatures. Besides 

a consistent decrease of ?SD with temperature, it is visible that the relative position 

corresponding to the three incorporation percentages is maintained between 35 ºC and 

45ºC, but above this temperature, quite distinct behaviors can be observed. A dissimilar 

behavior was detected for the synthetic surface sizing agent S4 (co-styrene-maleic 

anhydride) which shows a different behavior for each of the temperatures tested. In fact 

these are just examples of the myriad of patterns found for the various sizing agents. 

This is most certainly a consequence of the dispersive interactions being weak by nature, and 

thus significantly affected by the vibrational movement of the molecules caused by the 

temperature.  In fact the increase in temperature was found to alter the impact of the 

molecules size and spatial orientation of the molecules on the intensity of the dispersive 

forces (in particular when the molecules are non linear).

surface sizing agents S2 and S4 (St sample is also included, as reference). 

 

This is most pertinent for papers with a reduced polar component (like P&amp;amp;W papers) when 

subjected to printing devices, such as laser printers, which imply an increase in temperature. 

In these papers, the dispersive interactions are those ruling the printing process, and thus the 

results will be extremely dependent on the temperature. 

Since  ?SD was also evaluated from the contact angle measurements, it is interesting to 

compare the above results with the contact angle data.  

 

7.2.3 IGC VERSUS CONTACT ANGLE IN THE DETERMINATION OF ????SD 

As already mentioned, below 35ºC the IGC equipment can not be operated without 

substantial experimental problems. Thus to compare the values of ?SD determined by IGC 

with those derived from the contact angle measurements,  the former have to be 

extrapolated to 21ºC.The extrapolated values are calculated using the correlations 

presented in Table 7.2, being the comparison presented in Figure 7.17.

Figure 7.17 – Comparison of the ?SD values calculated from the contact angle measurements and from the 

extrapolation of the IGC data (based on the correlations of Table 7.2). 

 

As this figure clearly shows, the values of the dispersive component of the surface energy 

derived from IGC are always superior to those derived from the contact angle 

measurements.  

This superiority (mostly between 10 and 20%, but reaching in some cases 40%) is not 

surprising since the n-alkanes used in the IGC technique to perform the experiments are very 

stable molecules and are transported in very low concentrations within the inert gas, thus 

inducing the predominant detection of high energy sites which in turn leads to higher values 

of ?SD. Conversely, the contact angle method detects surface sites of all energy levels, 

computing an average energy level of the surface (Kwok et al. 1998; Shen et al. 2000). This 

also leads to higher amplitude of variation of the values determined by IGC, as illustrated in 

Figure 7.18. In fact, the colored lines of Figure 7.18(b) are more spread than those of Figure 

7.18(a), which are mostly coincident.

Figure 7.18 – Values ?SD (normalized relatively to the reference sample, St) determined for all the samples 

tested: (a) by contact angle method; (b) by IGC (using the regressions of Table 7.3). 

 

This leads to the conclusion that the IGC seems a more reliable technique when the objective 

is to differentiate samples in terms of ?SD. 

 

7.2.4 ACID-BASE CHARACTER  

As mentioned before, besides the dispersive interactions investigated using the n-alkane 

probes, the acid- base interactions, based on the Lewis concept, can be studied injecting 

polar probes.  

Previous studies published by other authors reported difficulties in evaluating the acid-base 

character using IGC, due to negative values of -?HAB (Wålinder and Gardner 2000), or to 

the lack of a clear correlation between the enthalpy of acid-base interaction and the 

acceptor and donor numbers of the probes (Asten et al. 2000). In the present study, 

however, the values of -?HAB are positive and good linear relationships were obtained 

between the enthalpies and the donor and acceptor numbers, thus validating the use of this 

methodology. 

It should be mentioned that the evaluation of the acid-base character of the surface is often 

performed using the values of the work of adhesion of only one polar and one non-polar 

probe. However, an accurate determination of Ka and Kb requires that several polar probes

should be tested which is a time consuming process (Shen et al. 1998; Santos et al. 2001; 

Carvalho et al. 2005). In the present work five polar probes were tested, and subsequently 

the acid-base character of the surface was evaluated by computing the values of Ka and 

Kb, according to Figure 7.4. The values obtained for all samples are plotted in Figure 7.19. 

 

Figure 7.19 – Values of Ka and Kb computed from the IGC measurements for the different sizing agents and 

different concentrations. 

 

From this plot, it is possible to observe that all the Ka and Kb values determined by IGC 

have the same order of magnitude, and for most of the samples the Kb values are superior 

to those of Ka. This indicates that the surface of the papers is predominantly amphoteric with 

a slight tendency to donate electrons (i.e. with a moderate basic character). In comparison to 

the sample sized with cationic starch alone (St), it is possible to see that the largest impact of 

the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents is specially noticed on the values of Kb. 

The surface acid-base character, evaluated by the Ka and Kb values, is ruled by the 

availability of functional groups at the paper surface. Thus, and similarly to the procedure 

followed in the last chapter, it is possible to elaborate further about the composition and 

orientation of the molecules of the sizing agents.  

Previously published studies with IGC indicated that surface sizing decreases the paper 

surface acidity, and stated that the availability of the hydroxyl groups (-OH) at the surface 

strongly relates to the surface acidity (Tze and Gardner 2001; Shakery and Tabor-Haidar 

2004; Carvalho et al. 2005).  

The influence of the percentage of the incorporation of the sizing agent in the blend will be 

analyzed individually, as in the previous chapter. Furthermore, comparisons with the contact 

angle results will be made whenever necessary.

Starting with the sample sized with the synthetic sizing agent S1, (co-styrene-acrylate), no 

relevant differences are found in the Ka values for 5 and 10 % incorporation (StS1-05 and 

StS1-10). Having in mind that the surface acidic character is related to carboxyl groups 

(COOH) and the proximity of Ka and Kb values at 5 and 10%, the most likely explanation is 

that the amounts of the styrene and acrylate functional groups oriented outwards are 

equivalent. Nonetheless, for the 5% incorporation, a slight predominance of styrene is 

detected whereas for 10% the opposite occurs (acrylate dominates). For 20% incorporation 

(StS1-20), a reduction in Ka and an increase in Kb were found, probably due to the 

electronic cloud of the styrene. This interpretation, based on the molecular orientation, 

enables to justify the results obtained by the contact angle method for the polar component 

of the surface free energy (Figure 6.13), which were not explained there. 

As for behavior of the sizing agent S9, which has the same composition of S1 (the difference 

between these two sizing agents lies on arrangement of the monomers), some assumptions 

regarding the orientation of its molecules at the paper surface were anticipated, in Chapter 

6, when analyzing the contact angle results for 5 and 10% of incorporation (Fig. 6.13). As 

explained then, the styrene monomer was the one oriented outwards, and only for 20% 

incorporation, the acrylate monomer was the one predominantly turned out. The IGC results 

confirm this analysis but reveals that at 5% incorporation the amount of styrene and acrylate 

groups oriented outwards is similar, while at 10% the orientation of the styrene outwards 

predominates. These results also indicate that the arrangement of the monomers (styrene and 

acrylate) has a greater influence on the acid-base character of the sample StS9 than in the 

case of sample StS1 (Figure 3.3). 

Although having the same monomers than S1 and S9, the results obtained by IGC for sample 

StS10 are inconclusive with regard to the orientation of the copolymer molecules at the 

paper surface.  

As for the surface sizing agent S2, composed of styrene and maleic anhydride, the results of 

the contact angle measurements presented in Section 6.2.3 suggested that its molecules are 

probably oriented so that the styrene monomer is turned to the exterior and the oxygen of 

the maleic anhydride monomer point inwards for all concentrations. This hypothesis is in 

agreement with the IGC results presented in Figure 7.19. In fact, the increase of the Kb 

values in comparison to the reference sample (St) is certainly due to the presence of the 

electronic cloud of the styrene monomer. In addition, when the amount of sizing agent is 



                           Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 139 

increased to 20% the electron accepting effect of the oxygen atoms of the maleic anhydride 

monomer is strongly enhanced, as detected by the increase in Ka.  

Analyzing now the concentration of the sizing agent S4, which differs from the sizing agent 

S2 in the styrene/maleic anhydride ratio (Table 3.2),  and considering that styrene causes an 

increase in Kb(as found for sample StS2), the enhancement of the basic character of samples 

StS4 in comparison with the St sample was to be expected. However, the increment in Kb is 

smaller than that found for sample StS2 in agreement with the also smaller styrene amount.  

As for the surface sizing agent S3, which is quite distinct from the ones referred to in the 

previous paragraphs, the analysis relative to the orientation of the acrylonitrile and acrylate 

monomers at the paper surface derived from the contact angle data (Section 6.2.3) can not 

be  confirmed by the IGC. Nevertheless, the variation of the Ka and Kb values are in perfect 

agreement with the copolymer composition: for 5% incorporation, a decrease of Ka 

relatively to the reference sample St is observed, which is a consequence of the smaller 

acidic character of the copolymer in relation to the cationic starch; increasing the amount of 

copolymer, the Ka gradually increases due to the augment of the number of electron 

accepting functional groups. 

Regarding the sizing agents S5, S6, S7 and S8, the IGC results are not conclusive in what 

concerns the influence of the polymer concentration on Ka and Kb values neither on the 

orientation at their molecules at the surface.

8 PRINTING QUALITY 

8.1 THEORY 

As described in Section 1.5, there are innumerous types of printing processes, however 

considering its importance in the P&amp;amp;W papers applications, the printing process selected for 

this work was inkjet printing.  

8.1.1 INKJET PRINTING 

Inkjet is a non-impact printing process, where the ink is emitted from a jet device, driven by 

an electronic signal, directly onto the substrate. The principles of inkjet were laid over a 

century ago, but the practical inkjet devices did not appear until the mid 1960’s and in the 

1970’s significant developmental efforts were made, the ink stream could be controlled and 

individual droplets could be charged (Svanholm 2004). 

However the real breakthrough for inkjet technology came in the early 1980’s, associated to 

the introduction of IBM’s personal computer (PC). In the beginning of the 1980’s, 

technological advances such as the thermal printers invented by Canon (UK Patent - GB 

2007162A, 1987) and Hewlett Packard (US Patent – US 4490728, 1982) had made inkjet 

a technology that was more reliable and more affordable, making it a strong potential 

candidate for desktop printer applications (Svanholm 2004). 

In 1984, Hewlett Packard launched their first line of low-cost printers with disposable inkjet 

print heads, which reduced the cost even further. By the mid-1990’s and onwards, the image 

quality, reliability and cost effectiveness had improved to a point where it was realistic for 

inkjet to compete with conventional small-scale printing. The resolution was improved from 

around 100 dots per inch (dpi) in the early 1980’s to 2400 dpi in 2004 (Svanholm 2004). In 

1982-1984, an inkjet printer cost $1000-$6000. Nowadays a desktop inkjet printer can be 

purchased for as little as $50. 

The principle of inkjet printing consists in directing individual drops to a paper surface in 

order to create an image. There are two main categories of inkjet printers (Oittinen and 

Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004): 

? Continuous (Figure 8.1a) 

? Drop-on-Demand – DoD (Figure 8.1b)

Figure 8.1 – Example of (a) continuous and (b) Drop on Demand inkjet printers. 

 

The continuous printers work by breaking up a continuous liquid stream into single droplets 

(normally using a piezo driver element). The droplets are subsequently charged individually 

and passed through a deflection array. The charge decides whether the droplets are to 

impact onto the substrate or are sent into a gutter and recirculated to the drop generator. 

The continuous printers are classified by the type of drop deflection method (multiple, binary, 

Hertz or magnetic deflection) (Svanholm, 2004).

The DoD print heads work by ejecting droplets only when they are required for imaging on 

the substrate. These print heads have a drop-ejection element that is located in an ink 

channel near the nozzle. When a voltage pulse is applied to the drop ejection element, a 

droplet is emitted. The DoD printers are organized by the type of drop-ejection element: 

thermal printers, which emit the droplet by a volume expansion of the heated ink (Figure 

8.3), and piezoelectric printers, which work by the high vibration of an electronically charged 

piezo-ceramic (Figure 8.4). Electrostatic and acoustic DoD printers also exist, but they are far 

less common than these two (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm, 2004).

Figure 8.4 - Schematic representation of the piezoelectric inkjet DoD printing system. 

 

Continuous inkjet printers print at higher speeds because the drop generation rate is 10-100 

times higher that the one achieved in DoD printers. However, they are also much more 

complicated and expensive, and this makes them more suitable for industrial applications 

such as the printing of packages, labels and direct mail (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; 

Svanholm, 2004). The use of DoD printers is limited due to the slow speed determined by the 

systems physics. Consequently, DoD printers are mainly used for office, home and wide 

format printing applications. Color pictures have an increasingly important role in home and 



  Physical &amp;amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface – Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 146 

wide format printing and digital photography is an important driving force behind color 

printing in homes. In 2002, more than 95% of the color desktop printers in the world were 

DoD units (Svanholm, 2004). 

Inkjet printing is a direct-to-substrate technology, since the ink goes directly from the ink 

chamber to the paper. It is thus of major importance that the ink to be used is appropriate 

for the physical process adopted by the print head (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004). 

A characteristic of inkjet inks compared with inks in other printing methods is that have a low 

viscosity. This is especially true for the continuous stream inkjet method where rapid drop 

formation requires viscosity near 1 mPas. In thermal jetting, viscosity is commonly less than 5 

mPas, being 10 mPas is the upper limit (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998).  

Inkjet inks are composed of mainly four components, with specific functions, as depicted in 

Table 8.1 (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000). 

 

Table 8.1 – Inkjet inks components.

Inkjet inks are currently commercially available in two different types: dye and pigment 

based. In the first the color consists of highly diluted solutions of soluble organic dye 

molecules, while pigmented inks consist in dispersions of micro-sized ink pigment particles of 

approximately 0.1 µm (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Glittenberg and 

Voigt 2004; Svanholm 2004). 

The solvents are blends of water and various organic materials, typically high-boiling point 

alcohols. Solvents are used to enable the ink to penetrate the paper and for jet formation. 

Ecological aspects, low viscosity and desired drying properties are the main criteria in 

selecting solvents for the inks (Donigian et al. 1999; Glittenberg and Voigt 2004; Svanholm 

2004)

Most aqueous inkjet inks have no binder. Binder-containing inks increase markedly in viscosity 

when small amounts of solvent are removed. When used, the polymeric binder creates a 

bridge between the pigment and the substrate. In water based inks the binder consists mainly 

of water-insoluble styrene- or acrylate-based polymers (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004) 

Additives improve ink properties such as light stability or electrical charge (Oittinen and 

Saarelma 1998; Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). 

Surface tension plays an important role in the runnability of the inkjet printing process. In 

fact, a high surface tension to form ink drops, but to be able to penetrate the paper, the 

solvent has to have a low surface tension. In water based inks surface tension is around 30 - 

60 dynes/cm, due to the mixing of water with organic compounds. This difference in surface 

tension suggests that water based inks can not be expected to behave as water (72 

dynes/cm), in terms of paper penetration (Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). 

Before drying, inkjet ink layers may be 15 µm or more in thickness for each color. For good 

printed appearance, the dyes should be fixed on the paper’s outer surface with only enough 

lateral spreading from the position of drop impact to merge adjacent drops in solid colors. In 

fact, proper dye fixation is the key to several components of inkjet print quality and, after 

drying, the dyes should stay at the surface, even if this is rewetted (Donigian et al. 1999) 

Additionally, because inkjet inks are highly fluid, highly surface active and penetrative and 

also because of the high velocity of impact on the paper, inkjet papers require 

characteristics that match with the inks and the drop volumes. Inkjet papers must respond to 

high demands on properties such as surface tension, charge, roughness and porosity (Oittinen 

and Saarelma 1998; Donigian et al. 1999). 

 

8.1.2 PRINTING QUALITY EVALUATION 

As mentioned in Section 1.5.1, there are no absolute definitions and concepts to define print 

quality and the corresponding paper ideal characteristics. They depend on the final use of 

the printed product. 

An ideal paper for inkjet printing must meet several runnability and printing quality 

requirements. For runnability the critical operation is feeding, which is influenced by friction 

coefficient, static electricity and cutting quality. Regarding printing quality, paper-ink

   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 148 

interaction is obviously the key factor, which is ruled by surface roughness, porosity and 

surface chemistry (Donigian et al. 1999; Levlin and Söderhjelm, 2000; Svanholm 2004). 

Printability tests depend on the printing process involved. Certain types of printability test 

are used for all types of papers regardless the printing method used, while some other test 

methods are only suitable for papers specific of a certain printing process. For inkjet printing 

quality some laboratory printing tests are commonly used, such as print density, print through, 

dot gain, circularity, and sharpness or inter color bleeding (Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000). 

The assessment of printing quality either in qualitative or in quantitative terms is the subject 

of many published studies (Varnell 1998; Chen et al. 2002; Donderi et al. 2003; Mattila et 

al. 2003; Rosenberger 2003; Danby and Zhou 2004; Lee et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005; 

Olsson et al. 2006; Mäkenen et al. 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ungh et al. 2007; 

Moutinho et al. 2007b). Some printing quality parameters found relevant for this study are 

presented in Section 8.1.2.1 (Kowalczyk and Trksak 1998; Oittinen and Saarelma, 1998; 

Varnell 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Levlin and Söderhjelm 2000; Hladnik 2003; Lee et al. 2005; 

Moutinho et al. 2007b; Sreekumar et al. 2007). 

 

8.1.2.1 Inkjet Printing Quality Parameters 

Printing quality parameters are mainly intended for the evaluation of two different 

characteristics of the printed image, the intensity or range of the color reproduction and the 

image contour definition. In this work, the color intensity will be accessed through optical 

density and gamut area, while for accessing image definition the gain, raggedness and 

feathering were measured, as described in Section 8.1.2.2. 

Optical Density measurement is probably the most commonly used property for printing 

quality evaluation. It abbreviates as OD, and is given by the relation between the intensity 

of the light reflected from a paper sheet before printing (I0) and after printing (I), as 

described in Figure 8.5. The calculation is performed according to Equation 9.1.

A higher value of optical density means less ink penetration. Density measurements do not 

have standard conditions: usually angles relative to the normal surface of 45º in illumination 

and zero in detection are used. In terms of printing quality, the higher the optical density 

values the better. 

The evaluation of color reproduction ability is based on the coordinates a* and b*, which 

represent the saturation of the color in the CIELAB color space (Figure 8.6). L* is a measure of 

perceived lightness, ranging in the scale 0-100; a* is a measure of the hue on the red/green 

axis (a positive value for a* means red, and a negative value means green); b* is a measure 

of hue on the yellow/blue axis (a positive b* means yellow, and a negative value means 

blue). Greater values of a* and b* correspond to more saturated colors, so that absolute 

values of a* and b*of strongly saturated spectral colors range between 80 and 90 (Levin 

and Söderhjelm, 2000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 8.6 – Representation of the CIELAB color space. 

 

Gamut Area is then a color relater parameter, which evaluates the colors that each paper 

can reproduce. It corresponds to the area of the hexagon whose vertices are the pairs (a*, 

b*) obtained for cyan, yellow, magenta, green, blue and red areas of a specified mask, 

plotted as depicted in Figure 8.7.

Figure 8.7 - Exemplification of Gamut Area’s Graphic representation. 

 

The higher the Gamut Area, the greater is the potential of a paper to reproduce colors. 

Therefore, paper 2 in Figure 8.7 is better in terms of color range reproduction than paper 1. 

 

As for the image contour definition, several mathematical parameters can be used and 

sometimes different definitions can be found for the same parameter. 

Gain is the difference between the printed area (PA) and the area that should have been 

printed (target area - TA):

In this case, better printing performance corresponds to smaller gain values. 

Feathering corresponds to edge defects caused by ink run along the fibers length (Figure 

8.8b). Also in this case, smaller values of feathering correspond to better printing quality.

Raggedness is the measure of the irregularity of the line contour (the smaller the better). 

Corresponds to the sum of the differences found between a straight line adjusted to the 

image line, and the printed line. 

 

When using water based inkjet inks, the extent of spreading and penetration of the ink 

components in the paper surface and fibrous matrix has a major effect on all these print 

quality parameters. Poor penetration of the ink vehicle means slow drying of the ink, which 

results in problems of color bleeding and feathering. On the other hand, too much 

penetration of the colored dye reduces color saturation, producing an image of inferior 

quality. For good print quality a compromise must be achieved between ink drying (which 

requires good penetration) and color saturation (which require poor penetration) (Keskitalo, 

2000; Svanholm, 2004). 

 

8.1.2.2 Methodology  

For the evaluation of the inkjet printing quality of all the samples produced three main 

aspects were addressed in this study: color reproduction intensity/range and image 

definition, as quantitative information, and human perception of printing quality, as 

subjective qualitative assessment of the papers performance in terms of inkjet printing 

quality. For that a specific mask was selected were three zones can be isolated (Figure 8.9): 

? Zone A – where the color related measurements were performed; 

? Zone B – where the line quality was evaluated; 

? Zone C – used for the subjective printing quality evaluation.

Figure 8.9– Mask printed in the paper samples for the printing quality evaluation. 

 

Several preliminary tests were performed in order to determine the necessary number of 

prints and the number of measurements to be performed for accessing each parameter. 

According to those testes, it was decided to print the mask presented in Figure 8.9 in two 

sheets of each paper sample, using different sides of the sheet. 

The paper sheets were printed using an HP5652 inkjet printer, selecting always the same 

printing mode, indicated in the printer settings as “best”. The printing quality parameters 

were then assessed for each paper sheet printed.

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 153 

Optical Density (OD) values were measured in the black, cyan, magenta and yellow areas in 

the zone indicated as A in Figure 8.9 using the spectrophotometer Gretag D19C. At least 

three measurements for each color were performed in each printed sample and an average 

value was computed for the OD values of each color and paper. 

The CIELab color coordinates (a*, b*) used to compute the gamut area values were assessed 

using the AvaMouse spectrophotometer. For each paper sheet, two separate measurements 

of a* and b* for each of the six colors (A zone of the mask) were performed, and the gamut 

area was computed using the average values of those measurements. This procedure was 

repeated for the two sheets printed for each paper type, and the average of the two values 

was used for further analysis. 

Regarding the image definition, accessed in this work by evaluation the line quality a 

personal image analysis system PIA BASF – 8042319 was used in the black line with yellow 

background (B zone of the mask). For each type of paper tested, the average of six 

measurements was considered (three separated measurements for each printed sheet). Each 

of the three measurements performed by sheet corresponds to a different zone of the 

printed line and to six measurements of each property. The variables measured by this 

device are named as plain (mm2), borderlenght (mm) and roughness and are used to access 

the printing quality parameters gain, feathering and raggedness, respectively. 

The subjective evaluation was based on the perception of an independent panel of ten 

different persons, regarding the images printed (zone C of Figure 8.9). The following 

procedure was used: 

? The pictures were separated in four groups (corresponding to two pictures in two sheets 

of each type of paper).  

? Each panel member was asked, for each of the four groups separately, to classify the 

images according to his personal preference in a 0 to 100 scale, assigning a different 

classification only when perceiving a relevant difference between the samples. 

? The results were normalized according to the maximum and minimum values used by 

each person, in order to allow the comparison of the results. 

? The average of the normalized rating achieved for each sample was computed and 

used for further analysis.

8.2 RESULTS 

As presented in Section 8.1.2.2, eight quantitative parameters were accessed for the paper 

samples under analysis in this work (OD black, OD cyan, OD magenta, OD yellow, Gamut 

area, gain, feathering and raggedness). To determine which parameters are the most 

important to describe the samples printability, PCA was used, and a 73% degree of 

explanation of the results variability (42% 1st component; 31% 2nd component) was obtained 

(Figure 8.10). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 8.10 – PCA for all the printing quality parameters. 

 

Since the optical densities of the three colors cyan, magenta and yellow are in the same zone 

of the plot, and yellow is the most critical in terms of achieving a good inkjet printing quality, 

the OD of cyan and magenta were no further considered. The same overlapping was found 

for the line quality parameters (feathering, raggedness and gain), after testing several 

solutions it was decided to consider only the gain. Next, a new PCA was performed using the 

remaining four variables (OD black, OD yellow, gamut area and gain) and the result is 

presented in Figure 8.11.

From Figure 8.11 it is possible to see that the degree of explanation is not largely improved 

(79% is now reached, 49% corresponding to the 1st component, and 30% to the 2nd 

component). However the four variables are now quite more disperse, and therefore they 

will be used for the subsequent analysis. After reducing in 50% the number of variables 

important to study the printability of the distinct samples, by using PCA, ANOVA was carried 

out for each of them (Table 8.2).

The quality of this statistical analysis is ensured by the values of the parameters P, F and 

Fcritical, and the results reveal that for all variables the larger variation is due to inter-samples 

differences.  

The values achieved for the optical densities are presented in Figure 8.12 for the black color 

and in Figure 8.13 for the yellow color. The dashed lines limit an interval of 0.2 units of 

magnitude (in this case relative to the reference sample, St) usually stated and accepted as 

distinguishable by the human eye in terms of optical density differences (Oittinen and 

Saarelma, 1998).

considered that the samples can not be clearly differentiated from the St sample.

OD Yellow

 

Figure 8.13 - Optical density values achieved for yellow color. The lines delimit the range in which it is 

considered that the samples can not be clearly differentiated from the St sample. 

 

The black optical density values generally increase with the addition of the synthetic surface 

sizing agents to the surface sizing formulation (Figure 8.12). As for the yellow optical density 

a slight increase relative to the reference sample is detected only in some situations (Figure 

8.13 and the measurements do not allow to differentiate the samples within the limits 

considered.  

The increase of the OD values is probably influenced by the increase of the surface 

hydrophobicity of the samples due to the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agent, and 

it is more visible when using the black ink because it has as surface tension value more close 

to the one of the water than the one of the yellow ink (Donigian et al. 1999). 

It is important to emphasize that, in spite of the small differences, for both black and yellow 

colors, the optical density values of all samples are acceptable in terms of printing quality 

(values superior to 2 for black ink and 0.9 for the yellow ink). Nevertheless, and since it is 

always desirable to reach the highest possible values for this parameters, it is easy to find 

out that some samples (StS1-05; StS2-05; StS2-10; StS3-10; StS4-10; StS4-20; StS9-05; 

StS9-20; StS10-10) have a distinguishable positive combined performance, as depicted in 

Figure 8.14.

Gamut Area

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 8.14 – Identification of the samples whose behavior in terms of black and yellow optical densities is 

improved by the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the sizing formulation. 

 

As mentioned before, while the OD values report the color intensity achieved for specific 

colors, the gamut area is used to evaluate the paper ability to reproduce a wide range of 

colors. The results obtained are plotted in Figure 8.15. 

 

Figure 8.15 – Gamut area values. The dashed line in the figure corresponds to the Gamut area value 

achieved for sample St.  

 

For most of the samples the gamut area values are satisfactory (values superior to 7000 are 

usually accepted for this kind of papers and printing process). Using the St sample as 

reference, also for this variable there is a set of samples with an improved performance

resultant from the addition of the surface sizing agents to the sizing formulation: StS2-05; 

StS2-10; StS3-10; StS3-20; StS4-10;StS7-20; StS8-20; StS9-05; StS10-10 

The results for the gain are presented in Figure 8.16, and it is possible to see that most of the 

sizing formulations improve the printing performance in terms of image definition. 

Figure 8.16 – Gain values. The line in the figure refers to the value achieved for the St sample. 

 

As previously mentioned, the printing quality parameters refer to different aspects of the 

printed image (mainly color saturation or image definition) and thus they must not be 

analyzed separately. In this context, combining the results obtained for the four parameters 

(OD black, OD yellow, gamut area and gain), the samples with the best printing 

performance reported by the quantitative parameters that were analyzed are: StS2-05; 

StS9-05 and StS10-10. 

These three samples have styrene in the composition of the sizing agent used in the sizing 

blend, present values of wetting velocity between 0.09 and 0.2º/sec and polar components 

of the surface free energy between 6 and 8 mN/m. However, other samples also fitting 

these characteristics do not exhibit a good printing performance and therefore no definite 

and unique conclusion can be drawn regarding their combined influence in the printing 

quality 

Besides this quantitative analysis of the inkjet printing performance, and as mentioned 

before, this work also comprises a subjective evaluation of the printing quality obtained for 

each sample, from the point of view of the human perception. The results achieved using the 

methodology presented in Section 8.1.2.2 are plotted in Figure 8.17.

Figure 8.17 – Results achieved from the numerical treatment of the subjective printing quality evaluation (the 

dashed line indicates the score of sample St). 

 

The deviations presented for the qualitative perception of the printing quality are notoriously 

higher than those reported along this work, for the quantitative parameters, which is 

understandable considering the subjective nature of this evaluation. Additionally it is also 

important to state that the images evaluated are completely different in terms of 

requirements in color and details (Figure 8.9C). 

From Figure 8.17 it is visible that the majority of the samples were classified above 50%, 

including the reference sample St. This good result for the sample St is not unexpected since, 

as already mentioned, the reference sample corresponds to the surface sizing treatment 

usually available in the market for Printing and Writing papers. Most of the samples 

including synthetic surface sizing agents are identified as having a performance similar or 

inferior to the one of the reference sample, and among the three samples identified as 

having the best quantitative printing performance according to the parameters measured 

only sample StS10-10 is also identified as having good performance in the subjective 

evaluation. 

There is not a clear correlation between the quantitative measurements performed and the 

subjective evaluation of the inkjet printing quality. In fact, a PLS (Partial Least Squares) 

model was adjusted and it was verified that the 4 quantitative variables used (OD black, 

OD yellow, area gamut and gain) can explain the subjective evaluation results in 64% (32 

1st components; 32 2nd component), and this explanation is mainly due to the variables

8.3 CORRELATIONS AND MODELS 

From the discussion presented so far and in the previous chapters, is possible to highlight that 

the differentiation between samples in terms of printing performance and the detail of the 

analysis did not reach the same level obtained with the surface characterization techniques, 

which is a consequence of the differences in the corresponding capacity for the analysis of 

small and specific differences such as surface properties. Therefore, the use of more precise 

printing quality evaluation techniques to detect and quantify the differences between the 

samples is desirable. 

Nonetheless the remarks presented, it is possible to state that the addition of synthetic 

surface sizing agents to the surface sizing formulation improves some printing quality 

parameters and in some cases an overall improvement of the printing quality in terms of 

both, quantitative parameters and perceived printing quality was noticed.  

In order to relate this printing quality performance with the results of the previous analysis 

regarding the interactions at the paper surface and the effect of each surface sizing agent 

into the surface properties of the paper samples, partial least squares (PLS) numerical 

models were used. Table 8.3 lists the variables used to perform the PLS analysis.

Considering the number of variables and the groups that were made, a total of 135 models 

was considered. Table 8.5 and Table 8.6 summarize the results of those presenting a degree 

of explanation equal or superior to 10%. For instance, all the characterization variables 

together explain 14% of the variability of the total printing quality performance, with a 

coefficient of correlation of 0.02.

From both Table 8.5 and Table 8.6 it is visible that the explanation percentages as well as 

the correlation coefficients are in general quite small. 

The quantitative parameters are more explained by the surface properties determined, and 

in particular, the gamut area values are quite well explained by the Ka and Kb values 

achieved by IGC. 

The previous analysis shows that the surface characteristics influence the printing quality 

parameters that were evaluated. However, the techniques and parameters considered in this 

study do not allow explain and anticipate the impact of the nature, structure or amount of 

the surface sizing agents on the printing performance. 

This means that other paper surface properties and maybe other printing variables than 

those measured is this study and used in the PLS analysis should also be considered in order 

to fully understand the paper-ink interactions.

9 COMPLEMENTARY STUDIES 

This chapter reports some relevant studies that were performed using paper samples 

produced in this work, oriented to specific objectives, and thus subject of isolated papers. 

 

The paper “Effect of surface sizing on the surface chemistry of paper containing 

eucalyptus pulp” aims at verify for this type of papers the suitability of ESCA and ToF-SIMS 

in obtaining detailed information about the chemical composition of the outermost surface 

layers of the surface sized papers and at answering the question how those surface layers 

are affected by the surface sizing formulations.  

This specific study allowed to conclude that ESCA complemented with ToF-SIMS is a good 

way to evaluate the effect of different sizing formulations. The elements present at the 

samples surfaces were identified and their relative quantity could be evaluated. It was also 

possible to confirm that the samples surfaces exhibited distinct chemical characteristics. 

Although both formulations possessed the same percentage of cationic starch, relatively more 

of this polymer was detected on the sample surfaces, if co-acrylonitrile-acrylate was 

applied. This result was interpreted in terms of the properties of copolymers particles. It is 

suggested that the co-acrylonitrile-acrylate particles penetrate deeper to the paper structure 

than the co-styrene-acrylate particles due to their lower surface tension and therefore leave 

behind relatively more starch at the paper surface. Additionally, it was found that the 

increase of the sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 only slightly changed the surface 

characteristics. Accordingly, lower amount of size is enough for surface improvement. 

 

The paper “On the evaluation of the topography of surface sized Eucalyptus based 

papers” aims at compare the surface structure of two paper samples with different surface 

sizing treatments by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The sizing performance is also 

evaluated in terms of uniformity, particle size, shape and distribution over the paper surface 

as well as in terms of surface topography.  

This specific study indicated that AFM and SEM can be complementary used to study paper 

surface sizing. SEM allows a general evaluation of the surface and AFM enables to resolve 

small details on the paper surface, showing topographic differences not only between the 

unsized and sized samples but also between samples sized with distinct surface sizing

formulations.  In fact, differences both in the copolymer distribution on the paper surface and 

in the copolymers particle size were clearly visible. Nonetheless, these differences were not 

reflected in the roughness parameters quantified by AFM. Despite considerable differences 

between the absolute values of AFM and profilometry, the results of the latter (with much less 

deviations) confirm that both the unsized and the sized samples exhibited very similar 

roughness parameter values.

Abstract 

The effect of different surface sizing formulations on the chemical features of surfaces of the papers 

produced from Eucalyptus kraft pulp has been studied. The surface analysis techniques electron 

spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) 

has been applied. An uncoated base paper, the reference material, was sized with blends of cationic 

starch with either co-acrylonitrile-acrylate or co-styrene-acrylate. The results of both techniques are in 

good agreement and complete each other. It was possible not only to detect the presence of the surface 

sizing agents on the paper surface but also to distinguish them and evaluate their distribution and 



 

 clxxiv 

relative concentration. In addition, it was found that application of higher amounts of the sizing 

formulations, at a constant ratio of 20% copolymer to starch, did not change significantly the chemical 

properties of the paper surfaces.  

 

Introduction 

The papermaking industry has to increase its know-how and to improve the quality of all paper grades 

(COST E32 2002; Pruszynski 2003) because of the increasing demand of costumers and the competition 

between information media. For printing and writing papers and other special paper grades, physical 

and chemical properties of paper surfaces are critical for achieving a good performance of the final 

products (Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; Laleg 2004). The physical structure of 

the paper surface – its roughness and porosity, for example – plays an outstanding role on the quality of 

the printed details. The surface is influenced by the structural , and surface characteristics of the fibers, 

fines, and mineral fillers of the paper matrix, Moreover, the surface chemistry of paper has a great 

impact on the spreading and absorption rate of coating colors and inks. The surface characteristics of 

papers depend on the base paper composition and on the surface treatments, such as coating and 

surface sizing (Rutar and Hladnik 2000; Keskitalo 2000; Oliver et al. 2001; Koskela and Hormi 2003). 

Surface sizing influences the porosity, roughness, internal strength of the paper, particles detachment, and 

the hydrophobic character of surface. The latter is important to prevent excessive absorption of liquids. 

Starch and synthetic polymers are common sizing chemicals and these also have an influence on the 

physical and chemical properties of paper bulk (Pruszynski 2003; Koskela and Hormi 2003; 

Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Laleg 2004; Mešic et al. 2004; Moutinho et al. 2007). 

The characterization of paper surfaces is of outermost importance for evaluating the effect of sizing and 

selecting the most appropriate chemicals for a specific base paper (Donigian et al. 1997; Shirazi et al. 

2003; Forsström  et al. 2003; Hladnik 2003; Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; 

Mešic et al. 204; Ajerschi 2004; Hamers 2005). 

From the techniques currently available for chemical characterization of the paper surfaces, the two most 

capables were selected for this study. These are: 1) electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) 

and 2) time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Since the fundamentals of these 

techniques are well described in the literature, only a short description of each one is provided in this 

text. 

ESCA has proved to be a sensitive technique for obtaining information about the chemical composition 

and structure of a solid surface, within a sampling depth of about 5 nm (Dorris and Gray 1978; Brinen, 

1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Hale et al. 2007). It is based on the energy changes 

of the emitted electrons to generate a spectrum of peaks corresponding to the elements present on the 

surface (except hydrogen and helium). The peak areas give measures of the relative amounts of each 

element (absolute quantitative measurements are seldom feasible), whereas the shape and position of 



 

 
clxxv 

the peaks reflect the chemical environment of each element, namely their bonding structure (Dorris and 

Gray 1978; Brinen, 1993; Ström et al. 1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Hale et al. 

2007). 

ToF-SIMS analysis provides additional information regarding the identification of not only elements but 

also molecular species present on the surface. The distribution of molecules at the surface can be 

deduced from the data, also as a function of depth at a submicron scale. This technique is suited for 

comparison of samples as it delivers semi-quantitative information of the surface constituents (Kleen 

2000a; Kleen 2000b; Kristola 2001; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Kleen 2005; Lee t al. 2006; Parolis et al. 

2007). ToF-SIMS is based on ionized particles which are emitted from a solid surface when energetic 

primary particles bombard that surface. The secondary ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer, 

where they are analyzed by measuring their time-of-flight between the sample and the detector. Major 

compounds in mixtures can be separated. The mass range and resolution of the technique are high. The 

analyzed area in ToF-SIMS is smaller than that of ESCA, and the surface sensitivity is higher, because 

ToF-SIMS analyzes the outermost surface layers of 1-2 nm. 

There is large body of literature concerning paper analysis by ESCA (Dorris and Gray 1978; Kleen et 

al. 2002; Shchukarev et al. 2003; Johansson et al. 2005; Freire  et al. 2006) or by ToF-SIMS (Brinen 

and Proverb 1991; Kleen 2000a; Kleen 2000b; Kleen 2005; Fardim and Hombom 2005a; Fardim and 

Hombom 2005b), or both ESCA and ToF-SIMS (Brinen 1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen 

2004). 

The present work aims at obtaining detailed information about the chemical composition of the outermost 

surface layers of the surface sized papers and at answering the question how those surface layers are 

affected by the surface sizing formulations.  

 

Experimental 

Paper samples  

A calendered uncoated base paper (80 g m-2) produced from bleached Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp 

(ISO Brightness ? 90) and without any surface treatment was the reference (denoted as RP). This paper 

was surface sized with blends of cationic starch with either co-acrylonitrile-acrylate (samples A1 and A2) 

or co-styrene-acrylate (samples B1 and B2), as described in Table 1.

The surface sizing formulations were applied by a Mathis laboratory coating device (SVA-IR-B), which 

operates automatically with different velocities of the applicator roll. A 0.15 mm diameter roll was used 

at a velocity of 6 m min–1. The total surface sizing pick-up was controlled by the weight applied on top 

of the applicator roll: in case of no weight, a 3.5 ± 0.3 g m-2 pick-up was obtained (samples A1 and B1), 

whereas by placing two weights of 730 g each on the applicator roll a 9.0 ± 0.3 g m-2 pick-up was 

obtained (samples A2 and B2). The drying process was performed by an IR drier coupled to the 

applicator roll (1.0 kW drying intensity), followed by air drying (for at least 10 min). The surface sized 

samples were no further calendered. 

Surface analyses 

The ESCA analyses: AXIS 165 high-resolution electron spectrometer; monochromatic Al K? irradiation 

(12.5 kV, 8 mA). For each sample, survey scans in the range 0-1100 eV (1 eV step, 80 eV analyzer pass 

energy) and high-resolution spectra of the C 1s region (0.1 eV step, 20 eV pass energy) were recorded 

at three different locations. The areas of the peaks corresponding to carbon (200-300 eV), calcium (350 

eV), nitrogen (400 eV), oxygen (500-600 eV), and sodium (1000-1100 eV) were measured. The 

analyzed area was approximately 1 mm2 and the depth of analysis was 2-10 nm. The sample surfaces 

were neutralized during the measurements with low-energy electrons. 

ToF-SIMS measurements: PHI TRIFT II time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. High mass resolution 

spectra and images in positive and negative ion modes were acquired by a 69Ga+ liquid metal ion gun 

with 15 keV primary ions in bunched mode for mass spectra and with 25 keV primary ions in unbunched 

mode for images over the mass range 2-2000 m z-1. The primary ion current was 600 pA and time per 

channel 0.138 ns. The analysis area was 200 × 200 µm2 and the acquisition time 2 min for spectra and 

5 min for images. Analytical charge compensation was used for insulating samples. The calculated ion 

dose was 2.7?1011 cm-2, which ensured static conditions during data acquisition. Three replicate runs were 

made for each sample. Selected peak areas were integrated from ToF-SIMS spectra and normalized to 

the total ion intensity of the spectrum. Images were reconstructed from raw data files with the off-line 

WinCadence software. 

Results and discussion 

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) 

The elements present at the paper surface can be identified from the survey scans obtained by ESCA. 

Figure 2 includes the results of the reference paper (RP) and of samples A1 and B1. The spectra of 

samples A2 and B2 corresponding to the largest amount of sizing agents are not shown here because 

they revealed only minor differences in the intensity of the peaks compared with samples A1 and B1, 

respectively.

Figure  2  Spectra of the ESCA survey scans: (a) sample RP; (b) sample A1;(c) sample B1. 

 

The peaks corresponding to carbon, oxygen, and sodium can be easily detected in all the samples, 

whereas calcium is only visible in the reference paper and nitrogen in sample A1 (and A2). As readily 

visible, the most abundant elements are carbon and oxygen (hydrogen is not detectable by ESCA). For 

quantification, the amount of each element, relative to all specimens detected in the surface of each 

sample, was determined by measuring the peak area. The results, based on the analyses of three 

locations in each paper sample, are summarized in Figure 3 together with the reproducibility of the 

results. The reproducibility is satisfactory.

Figure 3  Relative amount of each element, obtained by ESCA for each sample: (a) carbon; (b) calcium; (c) 

oxygen; (d) sodium; (e) nitrogen.  

 

The amounts of carbon and calcium present at the surface of the reference paper (RP) are higher than 

those at the surface of the surface sized papers (Figure 3). The opposite is true for oxygen and sodium. 

The much larger amount of calcium detected in the reference paper is associated with the precipitated 



 

 clxxx 

calcium carbonate applied as filler, which is almost completely covered the surface after sizing. The same 

covering effect may be responsible for the slight decrease of the carbon percentage in the sized 

samples, while the proportion of oxygen is increased. The presence of NaCl in the cationic starch 

suspension (supplied by the industry) causes the increase of sodium at the surface of the sized papers, in 

comparison with the reference paper. 

Although the co-styrene-acrylate polymer (B) contained about 1.5% more oxygen than the co-

acrylonitrile-acrylate polymer (A), similar amounts of oxygen were found on the surface of A and B sized 

papers (Figure 3c). This indicates that relatively more of the oxygen-rich starch and less copolymer were 

found on the A sized papers. Besides, though having a low surface tension, starch has large particles 

(Table 2) which leads to high surface concentrations. We suggest that copolymer A can easier penetrate 

into paper than copolymer B, which can be explained by its lower surface tension (Table 2). Finally, and 

as expected, the quantity of nitrogen increased significantly in samples A1 and A2 due to the presence 

of acrylonitrile copolymer. 

It is obvious that no relevant benefits arise from increasing the surface sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-

2 since, in general, the differences between the reference paper and samples A1 and A2 are identical. 

The same is true for samples B1 and B2. Therefore, from a chemical point of view, a pick-up level of 3.5 

g m-2 seems to be enough to promote the key changes intended by surface sizing. 

The relative contents of the different “types” of carbon, considering their chemical environment and 

bonding structure, were determined from their high resolution spectra of carbon (Figure 4).

Figure 4  Quantification of the different types of chemical bonds detected by ESCA for the carbon atoms: (a) C1 

(C–C, C=C, C–H); (b) C2 (C–O); (c) C3 (C=O, O–C–O); (d) C4 (O–C=O). 

 

These results with a very good reproducibility are in agreement with the molecular structure of the sizing 

agents depicted in Figure 1. In fact, the relative amount of C1 is considerably higher for RP, especially in 

comparison with papers A1 and A2, probably mainly because of lower percentage of C=C bonds in the 

sized papers. Acrylonitrile-acrylate copolymer (A), e.g., do not contain any C=C bonds (Figure 1a). It is 

also clear that, in terms of the type of different carbon bonds, there is a greater resemblance between 

samples B1 and B2 and the RP (Figure 4a-c) than between the latter and samples A1 and A2. The 

exception occurs for the O–C=O bonds (C4, Figure 4d), which are predominant in the styrene-acrylate 

copolymer (B1 and B2). This result is also supported by the results from elemental analysis demonstrating 

that the copolymer B contains more oxygen than the copolymer A. 

Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) 

Both positive and negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra were recorded. In order to identify the most significant 

peaks corresponding to the sizing agents, subtraction of the reference paper spectrum was performed 

(Figure 5). The upper parts of each difference spectra show the peaks which are typical for the sized 

papers, while the peaks in the lower side represent the reference paper. Figure 5a (m z-1 0 – 70, 

positive ion difference spectra), Figure 5b (m z-1 70 – 110, positive ion difference spectra) and Figure 5c 

(m z-1 0 – 70, negative ion difference spectra) show the results for paper A1, while the corresponding 

difference spectra for paper B1 are presented in Figs. 5d-f. The most relevant peaks are listed in Table 

3. The difference spectra revealed more typical peaks than presented in Table 3 for both the starch and 

the acrylates, but the selected peaks are the most intense ones for the compounds and therefore they 

were evaluated. Sodium, calcium, cationic starch, and acrylate were evaluated from the positive mass 

spectra, whereas acrylonitrile was analyzed from the negative mass spectra.

Figure 5  ToF-SIMS difference spectra between the sized paper A1 and the reference paper (a-c) as well as that

The difference spectra in Figure 5 confirm that the surfaces of the samples exhibit distinct chemical 

characteristics. The surface characteristics of the sized papers clearly differ from those of the reference 

paper. Also, the differently sized papers clearly differ from each other having typical characteristics of 

their own in addition to their similarities, which originated from cationic starch and acrylate, both present 

in sized papers. According to Figure 5, the reference paper contains more calcium (peak at m z-1 40) 

than the sized papers, whereas the sized papers have more sodium (peak at m z-1 23), cationic starch 

(peaks at m z-1 58 and 59) (Matsushita et al. 2007), and acrylate (peaks at m z-1 71, 73, 85, 87, 99 

and 101) on their surfaces. Since the difference spectra for samples A2 and B2 were quite similar to the 

ones given for A1 and B1, respectively, they are not presented here. It should be mentioned that, 

according to some authors, the penetration of the cationic starch may be larger than the depth of 

analysis achieved by this technique (Lipponen, 2004; Lipponen, 2005). 

The difference spectra between the negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra from the sized papers and the RP 

(Figure 5c,f) indicates the presence of acrylonitrile (peak m z-1 26) on the surface of A1, but not on the 



 

 
clxxxiii 

surface of B1 paper. Corresponding results were also observed for A2 and B2 samples. In addition, the 

results in Figure 5c,f support the ESCA results (Figure 3c) showing that there is more oxygen (peak m z-1 

16) on the surfaces of the sized papers than on the surface of the RP. 

As an attempt to determine the relative quantity of each chemical specimen for each paper sample, the 

areas of the peaks in Table 3 were integrated from the original positive and negative ion ToF-SIMS 

spectra. The results, after combining the peaks according to their origin, are plotted in Figure 6. 

Accordingly, the reproducibility of the results is very good.

Like in ESCA results (Figure 3), the RP exhibits a considerable amount of calcium, while only traces of it 

were found on all the surface sized samples (Figure 6a). On the other hand, the amount of sodium is much 

higher in the sized papers (Figure 6b. These results also confirm that NaCl in the starch suspension is 

detectable at the surface. Only a slight increase in the surface concentration of sodium was observed 

when the amount of size was almost threefold.

As expected, surface sized samples possess more starch at the surface than the reference paper (Figure 

6c. Somewhat larger relative amounts of starch are detected on the surfaces of samples A1 and A2 in 

comparison to B1 and B2. This is in agreement with the results from ESCA. Probably, the co-acrylonitrile-

acrylate particles have penetrated more easily the bulk of paper than the co-styrene-acrylate ones. As 

discussed before, this is probably due to the surface tension values. Some increase in the surface 

concentration of starch was observed when the amount of size was almost threefold. 

The results further confirm the presence of acrylate in all the sizing formulations (Figure 6d). The amount 

of acrylate on the surfaces of B samples is higher than in the A samples, probably due to its higher 

concentration in B formulations. Large amount of acrylonitrile was found on the sized A papers, as 

expected. Paper A2 had clearly higher surface concentration of acrylonitrile than paper A1. Neither the 

RP nor the sized B papers contain acrylonitrile. 

In general, the increase of the surface sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 in both cases had relatively 

low impact on the paper surface composition. The surface concentration of sodium and starch increased 

slightly, while that of acrylonitrile increased somewhat more. These effects were not seen with ESCA. ToF-

SIMS is more sensitive with this regard as ESCA. 

ToF-SIMS also provides additional information about the spatial distribution of surface compounds. 

Figure 7 presents the sodium images of the five samples analyzed in this study. Sodium images were 

chosen since it was already proved that the sodium is from the sizing blends.

The larger area of white spots in Figures 7b to 7e confirms the presence of the surface sizing in samples 

A1, A2, B1 and B2. More sizing was found on A2 and B2 than on A1 and B1, respectively. Although 

distributed throughout the paper surfaces, the sizing formulation does not form a continuous film.

Conclusions 

ESCA complemented with ToF-SIMS proved to be a good way to evaluate the effect of different sizing 

formulations. The elements present at the samples surfaces were identified and their relative quantity 

could be evaluated. It was also possible to confirm that the samples surfaces exhibited distinct chemical 

characteristics. Although both formulations possessed the same percentage of cationic starch, relatively 

more of this polymer was detected on the sample surfaces, if co-acrylonitrile-acrylate was applied. This 

result was interpreted in terms of the properties of copolymers particles. It is suggested that the co-

acrylonitrile-acrylate particles penetrate deeper to the paper structure than the co-styrene-acrylate 

particles due to their lower surface tension and therefore leave behind relatively more starch at the 

paper surface. Additionally, it was found that the increase of the sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 

only slightly changed the surface characteristics. Accordingly, lower amount of size is enough for surface 

improvement.

ABSTRACT 

The surface properties of paper depend not only on the fibrous matrix but also on the final treatment of 

the paper surface. The present work compares paper samples with two different surface sizing 

treatments by using AFM and profilometry to assess topography and roughness parameters as well as to 

evaluate the spreading of the sizing formulation and to estimate sizing agent particle sizes. The results 

were confronted with dynamic light scattering measurements regarding particle size. This work shows that 

AFM is a valuable technique to visualize the effects of sizing onto the paper surface. However, due to the 

small pick up applied no differences could be detected in terms of the surface roughness parameters.

INTRODUCTION 

Printing quality is strongly influenced by the structural and chemical properties of paper surface, which 

depend not only on the fibrous matrix but also on the final treatment of the surface.  This treatment may 

be of physical nature, like calendering, and/or of chemical nature, like surface sizing or coating. A 

common practice in industry regarding surface sizing, which was also followed in this work, is to use a 

blend of cationic starch and a synthetic surface sizing agent1-3. 

Many studies pertaining paper coating can be found in the open literature, concerning in particular the 

characterization of paper surface in terms of physical and chemical properties4-7. However, not many of 

these are related to the surface sizing of fine papers. The present work aims at comparing the surface 

structure of two paper samples with different surface sizing treatments by using Atomic Force Microscopy 



 

 cxciv 

(AFM). The sizing performance will be evaluated in terms of uniformity, particle size, shape and 

distribution over the paper surface as well as in terms of surface topography. 

Although Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been traditionally used for surface analysis, it requires 

a laborious sample preparation (that can eventually change surface topography), needs vacuum and 

does not provide high contrast images on flat surfaces8. To overcome these drawbacks, AFM has been 

alternatively used, since it provides direct three-dimensional images of almost any type of surface in 

ambient air conditions, requires no sample preparation and can resolve extremely small surface features 

both at the micro- and nanoscale. Additionally, AFM images can be used to quantify surface roughness 

parameters. Other surface properties as hardness and adhesion can also be assessed. The technique 

seems therefore especially suited for the present study and has been previously applied by other authors 

for pulp &amp;amp; paper characterization9-12. The principles of AFM are well described in the literature13-15 and 

therefore will not be detailed here.  

In the present work, the results obtained by AFM will be confronted with those of SEM in what concerns 

the homogeneity of the surface treatment. The topographic parameters obtained by AFM will also be 

compared with those provided by Optical Profilometry, a non-contact technique increasingly used for 

studies of the paper surface3, 16. The equivalent mean diameter of the sizing particles estimated by AFM 

will be further compared with measurements carried out in the sizing suspensions by Dynamic Light 

Scattering (DLS). 

 

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 

Two distinct surface sizing treatments applied on a calendered uncoated base paper produced with a 

Eucalyptus globulus Kraft pulp were analyzed. Two different blends of cationic starch and acrylate 

copolymers, described in Table 1, were used for surface sizing. A sample of the base paper without any 

surface treatment was taken as reference (RP).

The surface sizing formulations were applied using a Mathis laboratory device, SVA-IR-B, which 

operates automatically with different velocities of the applicator roll. A 0.15 mm roll was used 

and its velocity adjusted to 6m/min, so that a total surface sizing pick-up of 3.5 ± 0.3 g/m2 (on 

both sides of the sheet) was obtained. The drying process was performed in two steps: firstly

using an IR drier coupled to the applicator roll (1.0 kW) followed by air drying for at least 10 

min. The surface sized samples were no further calendered. 

The chemicals used for the preparation of the sizing formulations were provided by a paper mill 

instead of being prepared in laboratory. Because of this, information about their properties was 

limited and/or confidential and thus the most relevant had to be experimentally determined 

(Table 2). The calculation of the ratio of monomers of each copolymer was based on elemental 

analysis. These results together with the software ChemSketch enabled to derive the schematic 

representation of the chemical composition of the co-polymers, depicted in Figure 2.

AFM experiments were performed with a Nanoscope IIIa microscope from Digital Instruments Inc 

equipped with the Extender Electronics Module, which enables phase imaging in the tapping 

mode. High and low tapping images were acquired. Silicon cantilevers with a resonance 

frequency of 250-319 kHz were used. The damping ratio set point amplitude/free amplitude 

was varied between 0.5 and 0.8, and scanning rates from 0.7 to 2.0 Hz were used. The free 

amplitude varied between 100 and 150 nm Images of the surface topography and phase

contrast, corresponding to 512 × 512 pixels in size were acquired by measuring the three 

samples (RP, A1, B1) in air. For that, areas of 5 × 5 µm2 were analyzed. Filtering was not used 

during scanning. 

From AFM data, the following roughness parameters were computed, using at least eight images 

per sample17, 18: average roughness (Sa, µm); root mean square roughness (Sq, µm); maximum 

peak height (Sp, µm) maximum valley depth (Sv, µm); skewness (Ssk); and the ratio of the 

developed surface area to the nominal surface area (Sdr). 

The JSM-5310 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) from Jeol was used with a 20 kV electronic 

beam intensity and images with magnifications from 200× to 3500× were acquired (the images 

obtained with higher magnifications were not good enough for further analysis).  

The profilometry measurements were carried out using a monochromatic laser profilometer 

Altisurf 500 from AltiMet coupled with the PaperMap software. For each sample at least six 

images of 4 × 4 mm2 in size were scanned with a scanning resolution of 2 µm. From the 2000 

profiles obtained for each piece, the aforementioned roughness parameters were computed. 

Mean particle size and size distributions were measured for the sizing formulations by dynamic 

light scattering (DLS) using the Coulter N4 Plus19, 20. Samples were previously sonicated. At least 

three independent measurements were performed for each sample20. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was first applied in order to evaluate qualitatively the 

uniformity of the surface treatment. The resulting images are presented in Figure 2.

amplifications (a) 200×, (b) 1000× and (c) 3500×, obtained using a 20 kV electronic beam. 

 

The SEM images in Figure 2 reveal that surface sizing has changed the surface to a more closed 

structure with less porosity between the cellulose fibres. However, no fine structure can be 

resolved on the studied paper surfaces. 

On the contrary, a more detailed structure is seen in Figure 3 which shows AFM topographic (a), 

phase contrast (b) and 3D simulation (c) images obtained in the high tapping mode for the 

samples RP, A1 and B1.

For the reference sample the fine structure of the cellulose fibre is resolved, consisting of bundles 

of microfibrils. In the sized samples these bundles are not visible, instead, a smoother surface is 

apparent with a granular fine structure. The differences between the sized samples appear in 

terms of spreading of sizing formulation as well as the size of the grains (particles). The co-

styrene-acrylate appears to be more evenly spread over the paper surface than the co-

acrylonitrile-acrylate. Besides, the particles of the former appear to be smaller and more 

spherical than those of the latter.  

The average values obtained for the topographical parameters, together with the corresponding 

deviation values are listed in Table 3. Besides the roughness parameters, also the diameter of

All the topographic parameters exhibited a large standard deviation. This may refer to the low 

homogeneity of the surfaces at the nanoscale. However, the most probable explanation is the 

analyzed image area (5 × 5 µm2) in contrast to the size of the imaged objects, which may result 

in a data set in which part of the images represent a fibre surface, part of the images represent 

edges of the fibres, and some of the images may even represent the sizing material appearing 

between cellulose fibres.  

Higher values were expected for the roughness parameters Sa, Sq, Sp and Sv of the reference 

paper, when comparing to those of the surface sized samples, due to the distinct topographic 

features clearly visible in the 3D simulations of Figure 3. In spite of the aforementioned 

limitations, the visual inspection of the AFM images revealed two important differences between 

the surface sized samples A1 and B1, not detected by the SEM analysis: the particles 

corresponding to the sizing formulation of sample B1 are smaller (as confirmed by the values of 

Table 3) and more uniformly distributed on the paper surface. 

As mentioned before, the results of AFM were confronted with those obtained by dynamic light 

scattering (regarding particle size) and profilometry (regarding topographic parameters). Table 

4 presents the comparison of the diameter of the particles computed from AFM data and 

directly measured in the sizing suspensions by DLS.

This table shows that the values derived from AFM are larger than those obtained by DLS but 

the relative size (DB /DA) only differs by 10%. It should be pointed out that discrepancies 

between the results of the two techniques were expected since, in AFM, particles are analyzed in 

the solid state being most probably aggregated, whereas by DLS they are analyzed in the 

liquid suspension adequately dispersed. Furthermore, the tip-sample convolution results in 

distorted (too large) lateral dimensions of the imaged objects. The low values obtained for the 

polydispersity index guarantee the reliability of the DLS analysis (0.38 and 0.21 for A and B, 

respectively). The results of the optical profilometry analysis are listed in Table 5.

Sdr (%) 10.27 ± 0.33 10.35 ± 0.07 8.67 ± 0.02 

 

The absolute values of the parameters Sa, Sq, Sp and Sv in Table 5 are larger than those 

obtained by AFM (at least by two orders of magnitude), demonstrating the strong scale-

dependence of the analyzed parameter, typical for a non-stationary surface. This apparent 

discrepancy obtained with different techniques is also found in the results reported by other 

authors (Xu et al. 2005). The standard deviations for each measurement are much smaller, 

indicating that roughness at the macro-scale was less heterogeneous than roughness at the micro-

scale (assessed by AFM). The much larger areas scanned by profilometry may certainly 

contribute to this remarkable reduction in the variability of the results. From Table 5, it is also 

clear that, once again, no significant differences exist between the three samples, in agreement 



 

 
cci 

with the results of AFM, and that the surface of the paper samples is mainly composed of valleys 

rather than peaks since Sv is consistently larger than Sp and, simultaneously, Ssk is negative. 

In general, the results of AFM and optical profilometry show that the three samples tested 

appeared visually different, but the data was too heterogeneous to be able to demonstrate 

quantitative differences in the roughness parameter values. Two facts may contribute to this 

result: i) the pick-up used in each surface size treatment (approximately 1,7 g/m2, similar to the 

values used in industry) was probably not enough to introduce significant changes in the surface 

roughness of the reference paper; and, ii) the two sizing formulations being too identical to 

cause distinct impacts on topographic parameters (in fact, they contain both 80% of starch and 

only 20% of different copolymers (co-acrilonitryle-acrylate or co-styrene-acrylate) with 

different particle sizes). Nonetheless, it should be mentioned that these formulations originate 

important differences in terms of surface chemistry, as described by the authors in another 

publication21.  

 

CONCLUSIONS 

The above results confirm that AFM and SEM can be complementary used to study paper surface 

sizing, SEM allows a general avaluation of the surface and AFM enables to resolve small details 

on the paper surface, showing topographic differences not only between the unsized and sized 

samples but also between samples sized with distinct surface sizing formulations. In fact, 

differences both in the copolymer distribution on the paper surface and in the copolymers 

particle size were clearly visible. Nonetheless, these differences were not reflected in the 

roughness parameters quantified by AFM  

Despite considerable differences between the absolute values of AFM and profilometry, the 

results of the latter (with much less deviations) confirm that both the unsized and the sized 

samples exhibited very similar roughness parameter values.

10 CONCLUSIONS 

Having already outlined the relevant aspects of each of the covered topics within the 

respective chapters, the main conclusions to be drawn relate essentially to the integration 

and summary of these aspects. The major objective of this study was to analyze the 

alterations in physical and chemical properties of the paper surface caused by the 

application of different surface sizing formulations (constituted by mixtures of cationic starch 

and minor quantities of distinct synthetic copolymers) and the impact of these physical and 

chemical alterations on the inkjet printing quality of uncoated fine papers. The use of these 

surface sizing blends raised additional difficulties due to the lack of information about the 

chemical composition and structure of the copolymers, since these were industrial products 

and the only information available was basically about the monomers that constituted each 

copolymer. A trial and error procedure was then implemented to determine the monomers 

proportion. This was based on the comparison between the elements ratios calculated from a 

previous estimation and those measured by elemental analysis. Knowing the chemical 

composition, a schematic representation of the molecules structure was then proposed and 

validated by additional measurements of the compounds properties, such as particle size 

and surface tension.  

The different surface sizing formulations were applied to the paper sheets (? 3.5 g/m2) and 

some surface properties of the treated papers were determined using distinct techniques 

(some of them not routinely used for paper surfaces). The differences between the results 

were explained in terms of composition of the corresponding copolymers used and their 

quantities. Having in mind that the surface sizing is only a small percentage of a printing and 

writing paper composition, that the variation of the applied sizing formulations was only in 

the amount of copolymer added (20% at most, in order to be not far from the industrial 

practice) and also that some of the copolymers had identical composition, the initial 

expectation was for relatively small magnitude effects. Thus, and in order to guarantee that 

the differences between the samples were statistically valid, an analysis of variance was 

consistently applied to all the results of the various surface characterization techniques. 

The results obtained can be divided in two major groups: those related to the physical 

properties of the paper sheets (surface roughness and porosity) and those related to their 

chemical characteristics (surface free energy, dispersive and polar components, and acid-

base character).

Regarding the 3D topographical parameters measured by laser profilometry, it was shown 

that the surfaces are moderately rough with a predominance of valleys over peaks. With 

respect to porosity, mercury porosimetry has shown that a value around 56% was found for 

practically all samples. Additionally, the pore sizes exhibited a bimodal distribution with one 

peak around 3 µm and another around 20 µm. The increase in the quantity of copolymer 

incorporated in the blend led to a slight decrease in both porosity and pore size. In general, 

it can be concluded that no significant changes were induced by the distinct sizing blends in 

terms of surface roughness and paper porosity. As mentioned above, this is a logical 

consequence of the surface sizing treatment, since only small amounts of sizing were applied 

which in turn differed only in even smaller quantities of incorporated copolymers. 

Nonetheless, complementary studies carried out with AFM for some of the samples enabled 

to resolve small details on the paper surface allowing to detect differences in the size, shape 

and spatial distribution of the surface sizing agents’ molecules at the paper surface.  

Contrary to the results obtained in terms of surface topography, the differences in the 

composition of the surface sizing blends had a relevant impact on the chemical properties of 

the paper surface, as measured by contact angle and inverse gas chromatography. With 

respect to the contact angle, both static and dynamic measurements were undertaken.  A 

preliminary study of paper topography’s influence revealed that surface roughness does not 

significantly affect the contact angle values of the tested samples. As expected, the addition 

of the copolymers to the cationic starch increased paper surface hydrophobicity in different 

degrees according to the respective composition and concentration. As for the derived 

surface energetics results, it was shown that the P&amp;amp;W papers’ surface is predominantly 

dispersive, meaning that the polar and acid-base interactions have a smaller influence on 

paper behavior. However, these secondary interactions allow detailing the influence of the 

surface modifications, since they are more specific than the dispersive ones. In fact, the values 

of the polar component of the surface free energy obtained for different copolymer 

concentrations enabled to present solid hypotheses concerning the orientation of the 

molecules at the paper surface, namely regarding the different functional groups. 

Additionally, the dynamic contact angle measurements carried out with water to analyze the 

wetting behavior have confirmed some of these hypotheses and revealed that the addition 

of the synthetic surface sizing agents has an effect of controlling the wetting phenomena, 

both in terms of spreading and absorption.

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 209 

The IGC analysis of the dispersive interactions has not only confirmed but in some cases also 

complemented the hypotheses raised for the molecules’ orientation based on the contact 

angle measurements. Furthermore, it was verified that the paper’s dispersive component of 

the surface free energy decreases as the temperature increases and that the values derived 

from IGC are always above the ones determined from contact angle measurements, due to 

the specificities of the techniques. As for the acid-base character it was found that the paper 

surface is amphoteric with a slightly basic character (Kb values always higher than those of 

Ka) and that the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the traditional sizing 

formulation increases the surface ability to establish acid-base interactions due to a general 

increase of Ka and Kb values (more relevant for Kb).  

From the results of both contact angle and IGC measurements, it was possible to find out that, 

in general, styrene based surface sizing agents induce more consistent and logical variations, 

associated to the chemical properties of the compounds. As for the distribution of the surface 

sizing agents on the surface, it was verified that they stay at the paper surface in layers, and 

the amount necessary to complete each layer depends on the size of the copolymer 

molecules. Moreover, the functional groups of the sizing agent turned towards the air 

interface are those that mostly influence the paper surface properties.  

Complementary studies using ESCA and ToF-SIMS undertaken for some of the paper samples 

enabled not only to confirm the above findings but also to detect differences in the 

penetration of the copolymer particles into the paper structure, explained as a result of 

distinct copolymer surface tensions. Furthermore, the use of these techniques has shown that 

the increase of the sizing pick-up (up to 9.0 g/m2) does not significantly change the chemical 

properties of the paper surfaces. 

The final inkjet printing performance, evaluated through the determination of several 

parameters related to color reproduction and image definition (as measured by optical 

densities, gamut area and gain),  has shown that the surface sizing agents including styrene 

proved to be, in general, more successful than the remaining sizing agents tested.  

Regarding the surface sizing agents’ molecules orientation, it was confirmed that for better 

inkjet printing performances the predominance of non-polar rather than polar groups turned 

outwards is desirable. However the predominance of these polar groups can not be 

excessive since they must also be accessible for paper-ink interactions in order to allow the 

ink to dry fast.

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 210 

As for the subjective evaluation of the inkjet printing quality performed by a panel of end-

users, it was verified that the human perception of quality in a printed image is more 

associated to parameters related with color reproduction quality (optical densities and 

gamut area) than parameters reporting image definition (gain). 

From all the available results, it can be concluded that the techniques used to analyze the 

paper surface seem to be more sensitive to differences in the sizing blend formulations than 

those specifically used to evaluate inkjet printing quality. This leads to the conclusion that the 

final printing performance is clearly under-evaluated with the existing techniques. 

Nonetheless, the results point to some recommended windows for the values of key variables 

that potentiate a good printing quality:  

75º &amp;lt;water contact angle &amp;lt;85º; 

0.09º/sec &amp;lt;wetting velocity &amp;lt;0.19º/sec 

6 mN/m &amp;lt;polar component of the surface free energy &amp;lt;12 mN/m 

Finally, in the total set of samples, those with an overall better performance are samples 

StS9-05 and StS10-10, which include co-styrene-acrylate copolymers in the sizing blend.  

  

 

Additionally, the work developed throughout these years and the results that were obtained 

suggest some further studies in order to better understand the interactions ruling the printing 

process and the sizing agents’ influence on inkjet printability of uncoated fine papers. 

A deeper chemical characterization of the industrial compounds used in papermaking, taking 

advantage of polymer chemistry, computational analysis and reversing engineering, would 

be of utmost interest and usefulness. 

In spite of the fact that the methodology used for the surface sizing operation in the 

laboratory was quite reliable and sufficient to fulfil the objectives of the study, the 

knowledge of other variables involved in the process such as the temperature and 

rheological properties of the sizing formulations as well as the room temperature would be 

helpful to better characterize the sizing process. 

The delamination of the treated paper samples and the subsequent analysis of the distinct 

layers both by SEM and FT-IR would contribute to a deeper insight on the effect of the 

surface sizing process and of the absorption and spreading of inks.

Isabel M. T. Moutinho 211 

Based on the results that were obtained with some of the copolymers, the use of tailor-made 

sizing agents containing styrene would also provide a deeper insight on the interactions 

occurring at paper surface. A larger variability in the composition of the surface sizing 

formulations in terms of the percentage of surface sizing agent is also recommended, to 

better understand the influence of each compound. 

Finally,  and in order to obtain printing quality results with a detail close to that provided by 

the techniques used for the surface characterization, further developments in specific 

techniques to evaluate printing parameters are mandatory. This would most certainly help to 

achieve more comprehensive and reliable correlations between the surface properties and 

the final inkjet printing quality as well as to establish more consistent mathematical models.
