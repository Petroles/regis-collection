RESUMO 

 

A presente dissertação de mestrado baseia-se no estágio curricular feito na empresa Total EP 

Angola entre Julho e Dezembro de 2013. Os dados apresentados são relativos a um caso de 

estudo real de um bloco de exploração, que por razões de confidencialidade tem a designação de 

bloco Michocho. 

A medição pressão dos fluidos nas formações rochosas pode ser inferida, a partir dos logs de 

resistividade das formações. Em poços não perpendiculares às camadas rochosas, as curvas de 

resistividade apresentam valores mais elevados do que o esperado devido ao efeito anisotrópico 

das formações, portanto a inferência da pressão dos fluídos a partir destas resistividades pode 

conduzir a valores irrealistas. A maioria dos poços de desenvolvimento perfurados no bloco 

Michocho em Angola são altamente desviados, se não forem sub-horizontais, na secção do 

reservatório.  O objetivo deste trabalho é corrigir o efeito anisotrópico da resistividade devido à 

inclinação do poço em relação as formações atravessadas. A correção da resistividade neste 

estudo é baseada na fórmula proposta por Moran e Gianzero em 1979 e envolve a inclinação da 

ferramenta de indução e o coeficiente de anisotropia da formação rochosa. 

Para a aplicação desta fórmula nos logs de resistividade dos poços do bloco Michocho fizeram-

se, em primeiro lugar, testes de validação. Por falta de dados nos poços de desenvolvimento 

(poços muito inclinados), o teste de validação foi efetuado em cinco poços de exploração, onde 

se tem disponíveis logs de resistividades nas duas direções principais. Assumiu-se que a 

fórmula seria aprovada para a correção da resistividade se a resistividade horizontal obtida pela 

fórmula tivesse boa correspondência com a resistividade horizontal obtida pela ferramenta de 

indução de logs. Posteriormente à validação, fez-se a calibração do coeficiente de anisotropia a 

ser usado na fórmula e corrigiram-se as curvas de resistividades dos poços de desenvolvimento, 

estes muito desviados em relação as camadas rochosas.  

As resistividades corrigidas permitem a previsão da pressão dos fluidos nas formações rochosas, 

onde o principal objetivo é identificar formações de baixa permeabilidade que são zonas onde a 

pressão dos fluidos é mais elevada (Overpressure). Para ilustrar esta etapa, escolheu-se uma 

curva de resistividade de um dos poços de exploração e calculou-se a pressão dos fluidos em 

formações de baixa permeabilidade utilizando a fórmula proposta por Eaton, 1975. Com estes 

dados identificou-se uma potencial ocorrência de sobrepressões, situação que deve ser evitada 

na perfuração de poços. 

Palavras-chave: reservatórios petróleo; pressão dos fluidos; logs de resistividade; anisotropia 

das formações; correção da resistividade.

ABSTRACT 

 

This dissertation is based on a curricular training period done at company Total EP Angola 

between July and December 2013. The data presented relate to a real case study of an 

exploration block, which for reasons of confidentiality is designated by Block Michocho. 

The fluids pressure measurement in the geological formations can be inferred from the 

formation resistivity log. In not perpendicular wells to the layers, resistivity curves show higher 

values than the expected due to the anisotropic effect of the formation thus the inference of the 

pressure of fluids from resistivity logs can lead to unrealistic values. Most of the developments 

wells drilled on Block Michocho in Angola are highly deviated, if not sub-horizontal, in the 

reservoir section. The objective of this work is to correct the anisotropic effect of the resistivity 

of Block Michocho due to non-perpendicularity of the wells when intersect the geological 

formations. In this study, the correction of the resistivity is based on the formula proposed by 

Moran and Gianzero in 1979 and involves the dipping angle of the induction logging tool and 

the coefficient of anisotropy of the rock formation. 

Prior to application of this formula for the corrections of resistivity of the Block Michocho wells 

logs, a set of validation tests were made. Due to lack of data on development wells (highly 

inclined wells) the validation test was carried out in five exploration wells where resistivity is 

available in the two principal directions. It was assumed that the formula would be approved for 

resistivity corrections if the horizontal resistivity obtained by the formula had a good 

correspondence with the horizontal resistivity obtained by the induction logging tool. After this 

validation step, the coefficient of anisotropy to be used in the formula was calibrated as well as 

the correction of the curves of resistivity of the remaining development wells, those much more 

diverted regarding the rock layers. 

The corrected resistivity can be applied for pore pressure prediction in low permeability rock 

formations, in which the main objective is to identify regions where fluid pressure is higher than 

normal pressure, i.e. overpressure regions. For illustration purposes, a resistivity curve from an 

exploration well was chosen and the pressure of the fluids in low permeability rocks was 

computed by using the formula proposed by Eaton in 1975. With this well data, a potential 

overpressure region was identified and should be avoided in drilling activities. 

 

Key-words: oil reservoir; fluids pressure; resistivity logs; geological formation anisotropy; 

correction of resistivity.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The resistivity is a measure used to infer pore pressures lithology in depth, once it is not 

possible to measure the pressure directly from the rock formations. In deviated wells, due to the 

lack of logs data available in the non-reservoir zones, it is difficult to follow-up continuously 

the pressure. 

The resistivity and gamma ray are both usually some of the available well logs, and those data 

are often used for reservoir characterization and modelling (Luis &amp;amp; Almeida, 1996; Da Costa e 

Silva et al, 1997; Almeida, 2010; Quental et al, 2012; Kuznetsova et al, 2014; Alves et al, 

2014). But resistivity measurements are affected by wells deviations mainly in the low 

permeability zones. Hence, to use resistivity for pressure predictions, it is necessary to correct 

the anisotropy generated by the deviation of the wells and make use of an apparent angle. 

The correction of anisotropy in the resistivity must be done just in low permeability rock 

formations, such as mudstone and shale. 

 If corrections are not made to resistivity, anisotropy and dip may cause erroneous induction log 

interpretation (Klein, 1993). 

The first and main objective of the work is to test a methodology to correct resistivity from 

anisotropy generated by the apparent angle of intersection between the wells and the geological 

formations (dip plus deviation). In order to validate the proposed method of correction of 

anisotropy, a set of wells with logs data from log while drilling (LWD) and wireline (WL) were 

used. The study is addressed to real data from a block renamed to Block Michocho, and were 

tested and validated with five exploration wells closer to the operated fields. 

The methodology proposed for correction of the anisotropy is based on a model given by Moran 

and Gianzero (1979) in the paper “Induction Log Anisotropy Corrections” written by James 

D.Klein (Klein, 1993).  

This model assumes a laminated sand-shale sequence inclined to the wellbore with isotropic 

sand layers and anisotropic shale layers, and includes two levels of anisotropy at macroscopic 

and microscopic scale. The model assumes that the thicknesses of the individual sand and shale 

beds are lower than can be captured by induction logging tools. The parameters of the model are 

dip angle, sand resistivity, volume of laminar shale, shale longitudinal resistivity, and shale 

coefficient of anisotropy. 

The deviation of the geological structure in vertical wells can also generate erroneous i.e. this 

deviation is relative. The model applies only to laminated formations with bed thicknesses less 



 

2 

than the tool resolution. The preferred lithologies for pore pressure interpretation are shale and 

mudstones because they are more responsive to overpressure than most rock types.  

In this study, the corrected resistivity logs will be used in the pore pressure prediction to find 

along depth water reservoir, oil reservoir, overpressures zones, and it will help in the design of 

the well, and in the determination of the mud weight to drill, once there is a hazard associated to 

the drilling in overpressure zones. 

The hazards of pore pressure concern in pressure fluids within low permeability rock formations 

higher than normal pressure (hydrostatic) which can be termed overpressure. Abnormal 

pressures, particularly overpressure, can greatly increase drilling non-productive time and cause 

serious drilling incidents (e.g., well blowouts, pressure kicks, and fluid influx) if the abnormal 

pressures are not predicted before drilling and while drilling. Pressure prediction is fundamental 

for drilling activities. 

The pore pressure gradient is used in drilling engineering due to the convenience of determining 

mud weight as is shown in Figure 1.1. The pore pressure gradient at a given depth is the pore 

pressure divided by the true vertical depth (TVD). The mud weight should be appropriately 

selected based on pore pressure gradient, wellbore stability and fracture gradient prior to setting 

and cementing a casing.

The drilling fluid (mud) is applied in the form of mud pressure to support the wellbore walls and 

for preventing influx and wellbore collapse during drilling. In order to avoid fluid influx, kicks 

and wellbore instability in an open hole section, a heavier mud pressure than the pore pressure is 

needed. When mud weight is higher than the fracture gradient of the drilling section, it may 

fracture the formation, causing losses or even lost circulation. To prevent wellbore from 

hydraulic fracturing by the high mud weight , as needed where there is overpressure , casing 

needs to be set to protect the overlying formations from fracturing, as illustrated in figure 1.1. 

First, predictions are usually done from sonic or velocity logs, which are data available before 

and during drilling in order to determine the pressure in depth, particularly in low permeability 

rock formations. 

Resistivity is the measure used to infer fluid pressures in this study. However, resistivity from a 

high deviated well must be corrected due to its anisotropic effects. Most of development wells 

are highly deviated, if not sub-horizontal, in the reservoir section. and A proposed correction of 

anisotropy is presented in Figure 1.2 below, in which a hypothetical corrected resistivity of a 

development well termed Dona 761 was performed through the equation given by Moran and 

Gianzero (1979).

plot (middle) represents the inclination of the well vs burial around 90º. A correction of resistivity is 

represented in the third plot (right), as well as the comparison with the observed resistivity.

Dona 761 well is a development well with 80º deviation. The inclination angle of the well has 

an impact upon the observed resistivity values as it can be seen in Figure 1.2. It appears that the 

hypothetical corrected resistivity is the more appropriate method to infer pressure prediction 

attenuating the anisotropy effect observed in tool resistivity.  

This work is based on this type of correction, through a prior validation step using logs of data 

of five exploration wells with different inclination angles.  

This study is divided into five chapters:  

? The first chapter presents a bibliography synthesis that addresses overpressure, normal 

compaction trend, pore pressure prediction, anisotropy and its correction, and an 

explanation of the induction of gamma ray and resistivity logs. This chapter shows 

shortly the problem of resistivity corrections from log well data and relate all these 

terms to the case study. 

? Second chapter presents the method of correction of the anisotropy and the test of 

validation of the correction on exploration wells. It also quantifies and qualifies the 

influence of anisotropy on Block Michocho. In order to validate test findings, this 

chapter also explains how the equation of correction of the anisotropy in the fields of 

the block is checked. 

? Third chapter discusses the possibility of calibrating the coefficient of anisotropy 

using the normal compaction of the fields of Block Michocho and the application of 

correction on deviated development wells. 

? Fourth chapter addresses the application of the pore pressure prediction method in the 

Lango well and a discussion of benefits and disadvantages of the using corrected 

resistivity. 

? Finally, fifth chapter presents conclusions about the work and recommendations about 

using the study’s method to correct anisotropy. 

As to the parameters implied in this work, this study refers to the technical reports of the 

respective exploration wells from TEPA, in order to understand the lithology of Block 

Michocho.

2. METHODS 

This section details from a theoretic point of view a set of concepts to introduce the problem and 

the solutions proposed for correction of resistivity in the present case study. 

 

2.1 Overpressure 

The overpressure is a problematic issue during drilling in the petroleum’s industry. It can be 

understood as an abnormal pressure, which concerns in a pressure higher than normal or 

hydrostatic pressure in the formations as we can see in Figure 2.1. Normal pressure is defined as 

the weight of the water column that comes from surface. Pressure below hydrostatic is called 

underpressure and it will not be discussed in this report.

Osborne, 1998) 

 

In terms of dynamics of the subsurface fluid flow, overpressure is defined as inability of the 

formation fluids to escape. This retention of fluids can result in disequilibrium states of 

pressure, and to control that phenomenon it is very important to check the permeability and 

behaviour of rock seal. 

There are many basins in the world containing overpressured reservoirs and the age of the rocks 

in which overpressures have been recognized ranges from Pleistocene to Cambrian (Swarbrick 



 

6 

and Osborne, 1998). The carbonated rocks and clastic reservoirs are materials in which 

overpressure is found and it is in rocks deposited too deeper the sedimentary basins. 

The hydrostatic line in Figure 2.1 corresponds to single overburden stress, and pressure 

increases linearly with depth. The mechanisms responsible for overpressure are 

undercompaction, fluid expansion, lateral transfer and tectonic loading (Bowers, 2002); 

compaction disequilibrium or undercompaction and fluid volume expansion during gas 

generation are the ones with more magnitude.  

Undercompaction results from low permeability rocks (high sedimentation rates). Increase in 

vertical stress during loading can lead to incomplete dewatering of the sediment when part of 

the weight of the load is added to the pore-fluid pressure. This is commonly termed 

“undercompaction”. 

Overpressure due to compaction disequilibrium is often recognized by higher porosity than 

expected at a given depth. Porosity can be considered as a function of the overburden stress and 

the effective stress. If all the fluid is retained the porosity and effective stress remain constant 

with depth. Conditions that favour compaction disequilibrium are rapid burial and low 

permeability rocks. 

Compaction disequilibrium is therefore likely to be found in thick clay and shale successions 

during continuous rapid burial (England et al, 1987). Overpressure in adjacent, high 

permeability reservoir rocks will result from isolation of the reservoir within the low-

permeability section. 

To characterize compaction disequilibrium, we must study the plots of pressure vs depth 

through fluid retention depth where overpressure begins and increases downwards along a 

gradient, which can closely follow the lithostatic (overburden) gradient. 

Fluid expansion creates overpressure in low permeability rocks, where pore fluid volume 

increases with minimal change in porosity and a rate which does not permit effective dissipation 

of fluids. 

Overpressure can be generated within the pore space by fluid expansion mechanisms such as 

heating, hydrocarbon maturation, and the expulsion/expansion of intergranular water during 

clay diagenesis (Bowers, 1995). When such events occur, overpressure results from the rock 

matrix constraining the pore fluids as the fluids try to increase in volume. Fluids pressure within 

rock formation cannot be measured directly, but it can be inferred.  

Some log parameters allow the inference of pore pressures within rock formation. These log 

parameters are density, sonic velocity and resistivity. Just as in an overpressure situation, which 

appears in rock formations with low permeability, log parameters can infer pressure indirectly 



 

7 

identifying shale layers. When pore pressure in shale formations using log parameters are 

inferred, the trend of the normal curve increases with depth. At a certain depth of the normal 

curves of these parameters that, is supposed to increase with depth, the pressure decreases. This 

means that pore pressure in this zone is higher than normal pressure, which corresponds to the 

normal curve. The subchapter 2.4 discusses this method in more detail. 

 

2.2 Normal Compaction Trend 

The compaction trend is related to the normal behaviour of porosity with depth. Normally with 

depth, the weight above sediments, that is termed overburden stress, increases and the 

compaction of the sediments increases, too. 

Porosity usually decreases with depth due to compaction. This occurs when the sedimentation 

rate is slow i.e., the equilibrium between increasing overburden and the reduction of pore fluid 

volume due to compaction or ability to expel fluids is maintained (Mouchet and Mitchell, 

1989). This usual compaction generates hydrostatic pore pressure in the formation. Therefore, 

the deeper the sediment is buried, the higher the overburden stress and the associated 

compaction. 

During burial of sediments, if compaction increases continuously and porosity decreases, fluids 

dewater with burial, this behaviour can be a linear trend, which is called by normal compaction 

trend line. When normal compaction is increasing with depth, there are zones in which 

sedimentation does not undergo the same process: porosity does not decrease as would be 

expected. In such zones, a phenomenon called compaction disequilibrium or undercompaction 

occurs. In zones characterized by compaction disequilibrium, fluids are trapped in low 

permeability formations with pressure higher than hydrostatic pressure. 

For in a given log, representative of porosity, the normal compaction trend is used to deduce 

abnormal pressure zones in the shale. In order to predict pore pressure build-up in sediments 

due to compaction disequilibrium, it is necessary to establish a trend curve for porosity versus 

depth due to normal compaction. One commonly approach is based on porosity versus depth 

relationship Athy (1930): 

    
 
          (1) 

Where   is porosity;  
 
 is the porosity in the mudline;   is the true vertical depth below the 

mudline; and   is the compaction constant in 1/m or 1/ft.  

As with porosity, resistivity is also used to infer fluids. As porosity, decreases with burial, 

resistivity increases in the shale along depth. The function of the normal compaction trend line 



 

8 

acts as a reference in the measuring resistivity to help to make a better interpretation on the 

study of pore pressure prediction being resistivity a parameter of control. 

It should be noted that pore pressure in the formation near the wellbore is affected by drilling-

induced stresses (Zhang and Roegiers, 2005). Therefore, in order to obtain formation pore 

pressure the deep resistivity is also required for calculations of the pore pressure. Figure 2.2 

demonstrates the normal compaction trend line. 

 

 

Figure 2.2 Normal compaction trendline according to resistivity versus depth. Red line is shale resistivity 

and black line is normal resistivity (Rn) (Source: Zhang, 2011). 

 

The resistivity varies according to depth as can be seen in Figure 2.2. At depths less than 4900ft 

below the sea floor the formation is in normal compaction. From 4900 to 7600ft, the formation 

is slightly under-compacted with lower resistivity than the normal compaction trend, implying 

that the pore pressures increases according to Eaton’s theory. From 7600 to 13000ft, the 

formation is further under-compacted and more elevated pore pressures exist. Figure 2.2 also 

demonstrates that the adapted Eaton’s resistivity method gives a good result in pore pressure 

calculation. 

It is difficult to determine normal shale resistivity or shale resistivity in the condition of 

hydrostatic pore pressure. One approach is to assume that normal shale resistivity is a constant, 

but this does not work in most cases. However, normal resistivity (Rn) is a function of the burial 



 

9 

depth, as shown in Figure 2.2. Hence, the normal compaction trendline needs to be determined 

for pore pressure prediction. 

Based on the relationship of measured resistivity and burial depth in the formations with 

hydrostatic pressures, the following equation of the normal compaction trend of resistivity can 

be used:  

      
        (2) 

Where    is the shale resistivity with normal compaction condition;    is the shale resistivity in 

the mudline;   is the constant; and   is the depth below the mudline. 

 

2.3 Pore Pressure Prediction 

Pore pressure is also known as formation pressure and is related to interstitial fluids that 

percolate within the rocks formations. Hydrostatic pressure occurs when the pressure within the  

formations is equal to the pressure in the column of water that extends to the surface. When the 

fluid pressure in the sediment with low permeability (shale or mudstones) is greater than normal 

pressure, overpressure zones are present.  

For a driller’s geologists, it is important to know pore pressure within formations to determine 

the mud weight required to drill future wells safely. 

The fundamental theory for pore pressure prediction is based on Terzaghi’s and Biot’s effective 

stress law (Biot, 1941; Terzaghi et al, 1996). This theory argues that pore pressure in the 

formation is a function of total stress (overburden stress) and effective stress. The overburden 

stress, effective vertical stress and pore pressure can be estimated by:  

  
      

 
 (3) 

Where   is the pore pressure;    is the overburden stress;    is the vertical effective stress; and 

  is the Biot effective coefficient. It is conventionally assumed that  =1. 

When overburden stress and effective stresses are known, pore pressure can be calculated from 

equation (3). Overburden stress can be easily obtained from bulk density logs, while effective 

stress can be correlated to well log data, such as resistivity, sonic velocity, bulk density and 

drilling parameters.  

The pore pressure profile is similar to many geologically young sedimentary basins where 

undercompaction is the major cause of overpressure that can be encountered at a certain depth.  



 

10 

In Figure 2.3, hydrostatic pressure, formation pore pressure, overburden stress and vertical 

effective stress with the true vertical depth (TVD) are displayed for a typical oil and gas 

exploration well. 

 

 

Figure 2.3 Variations of hydrostatic pressure, formation pore pressure, overburden stress and vertical 

effective stress with the true vertical depth (TVD) in a typical oil and gas exploration well. (Source: 

Zhang, 2011) 

 

At relative shallow depths (less than 2000m) pore pressure is hydrostatic, indicating a 

continuous interconnected column of pore fluid that extends from the surface to a certain depth. 

Overpressure starts deeper than 2000m, where pore pressure increases rapidly with depth, 

implying that deeper formations are hydraulically isolated from shallower ones. By 3800m, pore 

pressure reaches to a value close to the overburden stress, a condition referred to as hard 

overpressure. According to the equation (3), the increasing in overpressure causes reduction in 

the effective stress. 

Pore pressure analyses include three steps:  

? Pre-drill pore pressure prediction; 

? Pore pressure prediction while drilling; 

? Post-well pore pressure analysis.  



 

11 

The pre-drill pore pressure can be predicted by using the seismic interval velocity data in the 

planned well location as well as using geological, well logging and drilling data in the offset 

wells. The pore pressure prediction while drilling generally uses the logging data while drilling 

(LWD), measurement while drilling (MWD), drilling parameters, and mud logging data for 

analyses. Finally, the post-well analysis intends to analyse pore pressures in the drilled wells 

using all available data to build pore pressure model, which can be used for pre-drill pore 

pressure predictions in the future wells. The well-log-based resistivity method serves to predict 

pore pressure formation, in order to identify reservoir and fluids pressures. 

Eaton (Eaton, 1975) proposes an equation to predict pore pressure gradient in shales using 

resistivity log. This equation, presented below is more applicable for young sedimentary basins, 

and requires that the normal shale resistivity is properly determined. 

                   
 

  
       (4) 

 

Where     is the formation pore pressure gradient;     is the overburden stress gradient;     is 

the hydrostatic pore pressure gradient (normally 0.465psi/ft or 1.03MPa/km, dependent on 

water salinity);   is log the shale resistivity;    is the shale resistivity normal compacted trend, 

  is the exponent constant ranging from 0.6 to 1.5, and normally  =1.2 (Zhang, 2011). 

 

2.4 Pore Pressure Estimation in Real Time 

The estimation of pore fluids is a method that helps detect overpressure. It consists of the 

observation of the trend of resistivity (as study parameter) according to depth within low 

permeability rock formations such as shale and mudstones. Because resistivity increases with 

depth in the shale zones, we infer that fluids pressure also increase in a linear fashion.  

In Figure 2.4 below, resistivity versus depth is plotted in shale zones in order to predict fluid 

pressure. The blue line represents the linear trajectory of resistivity under normal conditions. At 

a certain depth in shale zones, the trend of resistivity decreases as yellow line shows. That 

sometimes happens; can be interpreted this as being overpressure due to a phenomenon related 

to undercompaction. The green line represents the top of overpressure.  

The estimation of pore pressure inferred in the resistivity log data can be performed in real-time 

or in the office, but the values of resistivity must be accurate and unaffected by the effects of 

anisotropy. Rather than resistivity, the method of pore pressure estimation in real-time can also 

be performed using parameters such as sonic velocity or density logs.

2.5 Electrical Anisotropy 

Electrical anisotropy consists of the dependence of resistivity on the direction of current flow 

within a rock. The measure resistivity in the induction logging tool in a vertical wellbore with 

horizontal bedding gives the longitudinal resistivity, which corresponds to current flow parallel 

to the bedding. Whether bedding has a significant inclination angle relative to the wellbore or 

dip angle of the well is deviated relatively to the bedding it is possible to obtain high resistivity 

values due to anisotropy. It means that horizontal induction logs crossed more than one 

formation or different materials in a certain depth of investigation.  

A rock is isotropic if it has same value of resistivity independent of its direction. If the 

measurement of resistivity in a given direction is greater than measurement of resistivity in 

another two directions, this rock is termed anisotropic rock. 

There are two types of anisotropy – microscopic and macroscopic. Microscopic anisotropy is 

related to the fabric of the rock itself. Microscopic anisotropy can be both mica or clay grains. 

Such anisotropy could originate during primary deposition and compaction, during later 

cementation or diagenesis, or by stress from tectonic forces long after deposition (Klein, 1993). 

To the naked eye, rocks with microscopic anisotropy can appear homogenous. Macroscopic 

anisotropy consists in homogenous rock layers divided in parallel sequences; each layer 

contains distinct electrical properties. In scale, the layering can vary from fine to coarse grain, 



 

13 

but the sequence of beds seen in part or whole behave in an anisotropic manner. Current flowing 

that passes through to the bedding perpendicularly have more difficulty due to resistance of the 

rock than when current flowing occurs parallel to the bedding. Macroscopic resistivity will 

affect measurement of resistivity when the scale of the bedding is less than the resolution of the 

measurement tool (Klein, 1993). 

The combination of microscopic (from individual beds) and macroscopic (from beds with 

different electrical properties) anisotropy results in total anisotropy that exists in a given 

bedding. The coefficient of anisotropy and the apparent angle (dip plus deviation) are 

responsible for the effect of the increasing resistivity, which does not correspond to the real 

reading of resistivity.  

Anisotropy in a wellbore with high angle relatively to the bedding can have huge impact on the 

resistivity. One interpretation of this resistivity log of specific material can lead to erroneous 

estimates of hydrocarbon (Klein, 1993). Hence, resistivities from wells in which anisotropy 

have a big impact must be corrected to improve interpretation of the formation and fluids that 

percolate in its interstitials. 

The influence of the anisotropy in resistivity (Rv/Rh) of wellbore highly deviated is shown 

below in Figure 2.5, where several curves of apparent resistivity having different coefficients of 

anisotropy vary as the relative inclination increases. 

 

 

Figure 2.5 Influence of the relative inclination in resistivity measurement when different values of 

anisotropy (Rv/Rh) within the formations are considered. (Source: KSI PPP Training) 



 

14 

Initially, all curves have 1ohm of apparent resistivity and until a certain point of relative 

inclination start to increase. Each curve of apparent resistivity with the respective coefficient of 

anisotropy increases with inclination relative to the bedding. The first curve (in red) has a 

coefficient of two (2), starts to increase clearly after 30º. The same occurs to the remaining 

curves, but the increasing gradient of the apparent resistivity is greater for higher orders of 

anisotropy magnitude. Without any doubt, higher coefficients of anisotropy correspond to 

higher gradients of apparent resistivity increasing. In addition, there is minimum value of 

inclination on the graph (around 40º) that anisotropy starts to have a significant impact on 

resistivity. 

 

2.6 Correction of the Anisotropy  

The main objective of this study is to propose a methodology to attenuate the effects of the 

anisotropy in the resistivity, using the equation proposed by Moran and Gianzero (1979): 

   
   

                 
      (5) 

  
  

  
       (6) 

Where: 

-    – True resistivity 
-    – Vertical resistivity 
-    – Horizontal resistivity 
-   – Angle between the tool axis and a vector normal to the bedding 

plane (figure 2.6). 

 

This equation must be validated for the field or block that resistivity curves will be 

corrected. The criteria of validation consists of correlate the measure resistivity to 

the calculated resistivity. The acquisition of the logs are made by two tools: 

- arcVision Array Resistivity that provides just the true resistivity; 
- Rt Scanner Triaxial that provides resistivity of the three principal 

directions; 

 

The corrected resistivity is parallel to bedding plane as well as horizontal 

resistivity. 

If the calculated horizontal resistivity using the true resistivity from Rt Scanner tool 

has correspondence to the measure horizontal resistivity from the same tool, in all 

study wells, the validation of equation (5) is done. Therefore, using the true 

resistivity from arcVision tool (where we do not have horizontal resistivity) in the 

equation (5), the horizontal resistivity can be calculated. 

Figure 2.6 shows both arcVision and Rt Scanner tools. The first tool is used in log 

acquisitions of development wells, which are highly deviated. The second tool is 



 

15 

more expensive and is used just in log acquisitions of exploration, which are the 

first’s wells of each field.       

 

 

Figure 2.6 Interpretation of the apparent angle. 

 

Both vertical and horizontal resistivities derive from the tool RT SCANNER TRIAXIAL 

INDUCTION SERVICE, and their ratios give the recorded coefficient of anisotropy with depth 

(  . According to Moran and Gianzero (1979), making correction using this equation is 

necessary to assume a laminated sequence of sand-shale, that has an inclination relative to the 

wellbore, and consider that material of sand are isotropic and low permeability rocks, such as 

shale is anisotropic. 

For a reservoir composed by intercalated layers of sand and shale that are sufficiently thick to be 

resolved by Depth Induction Log (ILD), only the microscopic anisotropy of the individuals 

layers are important.  

 

2.7 Induction Logs 

2.7.1 Gamma ray 

Nuclear well logging is fundamentally based on natural and induced gamma ray measurements 

and the results of neutron or gamma ray interactions with atoms and their components. Gamma 

ray includes natural gamma radioactivity, gamma ray emission resulting from bombardment and 

the different types of interactions with the elements.  



 

16 

Gamma ray is the most important radiation involved in nuclear logging because they have a 

high power of penetration and consequently can be recorded even if they have to cross the mud 

column or a casing. 

Gamma ray is used to measure the radioactivity of a rock formation. Natural gamma ray is 

related to the radioactivity intrinsic to rock formation, whilst induced gamma ray consists of the 

emission of energy to the rock formation to get a response of the lithology, which can be high or 

low gamma ray. The responses of the rocks formation are detected in a gamma ray detector 

installed in the logging tool. 

Clay minerals have a crystalline structure that can contain more radioactive elements than 

sandstones. Therefore, gamma ray data in well logs can be used to separate shale intervals from 

other lithologies. The step required to separate shale from other rocks is drawing base lines in 

gamma ray data, as shown in figure 2.7. 

A simple interpretation of the plot of the gamma ray versus depth is to consider that a 

measurement of above 75API (counts per second) of gamma ray, indicates a rock formation 

with huge radioactivity material and low permeability, such as mudstone and shale. Below 

75API of gamma ray, indicates a lithology with less radioactivity material and high 

permeability such as sandstones.

17 

2.7.2 Resistivity 

Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity. The electrical resistivity of a substance is its ability to 

block the flow of electrical current through it. The unit of resistivity is ohm-m and it is a 

fundamental inherent property of substance (metal, rock or fluid). 

The measurement of formation resistivity is of particular importance for the evaluation of 

hydrocarbon saturation in the non-invaded portion of the reservoir. Combination of the 

resistivity data with porosity measurements and formation-water resistivity knowledge allows 

the computation of the water saturation in both shallow and deep zones. Comparison of these 

two saturation values indicates the amount of the fluid mobility and, consequently, allows the 

evaluation of the reservoir productivity. 

There are several of techniques or tools in use for measurement of the formations resistivity, but 

all are variations of a common system: 

? One emitter (electrode) sends a signal (electrical current) into the formation.  

? One receiver (electrode) measures the response of the formation to this signal at a 

certain distance from the emitter. 

Generally, an increase in the distance between emitter and receiver (called spacing) results in an 

improved depth of investigation (and a reading nearer to   ), at the expense of vertical 

resolution.  

Resistivity trends are often used in pore pressure determination. This technique relies upon 

accurate determination of shale resistivity as an indication of elevated pore pressure. 

According to Hottmann and Johnson (1965), well-compacted shale rock with less quantity of 

water (less porosity) is more resistive than a less compacted shale rock. They concluded that a 

sequence of normally compacted sediments should have a normally increasing shale resistivity 

trend. Then, any shale resistivity decrease from the normal trend indicates the presence of 

overpressure.  

The techniques used to determine the shale points of the rock formation consist of trace a cut off 

in the a gamma ray plot and read the correspondent resistivity curve at the same depth (Figure 

2.8).

2.8 Types of Wells 

2.8.1 Exploration Wells 

The exploration well is the first well drilled in an area identified by survey data as having 

potential for oil or gas production. Enough accurate data from the field exists about the nature, 

size and viability of the reservoir and its contained gas. For this reason, it uses wireline logging 

to get more details (parameter) of the area. If an exploration well is well succeeding in terms of 

hydrocarbons production, it can be modified for production. An unsuccessful well is 

decommissioned and the area rehabilitated. 

“An exploratory well represents a risk for the company drilling it, because it is not known, 

before investing in the well, how much oil or natural gas it might contain. The well may turn out 

to be a profitable new source of fossil fuel, or it may contain noncommercial quantities of fuel 

that aren't worth extracting; in the latter case, the well may be plugged and abandoned.” 

(Source: www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exploratory-well.asp). 

In summary, an exploration well is drilled to:  

a) Find oil or gas in an area previously considered unproductive;  

b) Find a new reservoir in a known field, i.e., one previously producing oil and gas from 

another reservoir; 

c) Extend the limit of a known oil or gas reservoir  

 

2.8.2 Development Wells 

Development wells are wells drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the 

depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive, to maximize the chances of success.  In 

order arrive to the reservoir horizontally, development wells generally are highly deviated.  

Development wells do not need much log data, hence log data acquisitions are made by 

logging-while-drilling (LWD) mainly true resistivity and gamma ray exist.

2.9 Description of the Logging Tools 

This study uses two techniques to produce the acquisition of logging data: (1) Logging While 

Drilling (LWD); and (2) Wireline logging (LW).  

Logging While Drilling is the technique of transmitting well logging tools into a well borehole 

downhole as part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). Wireline logging is an expensive 

technique that consists of continuously collecting and recording data from a borehole during the 

drilling process.  

The LWD – arcVISION is a compensated array resistivity tool developed by Schlumberger for 

medium to large boreholes (Figure 2.9). The 6.75 inch (17 cm) diameter tool makes multiple, 

borehole-compensated phase shift and attenuation resistivity measurements at two frequencies: 

2MHz and 400 kHz; With arcVision, which usually uses 2MHz. At 2 MHz, phase-shift and 

attenuation can be measured between two antennas with negligible induction. Borehole 

compensation cancels the differences between the two receivers. 

 

 

Figure 2.9 arcVISION tool and devices: wear band, transmitters and receivers. (Source: Schlumberger) 

 

The tool’s antenna array consists of five transmitters and two receivers to achieve both a range 

of depths of investigations as well as borehole compensation. This tool provides gamma ray, 

resistivity, inclination and annular pressure–while–drilling measurements (APWD) that help to 

produce and evaluate reservoirs. 

To differentiate between borehole effects, anisotropy, invasion and shoulder beds are useful for  

multiple depths of investigation (DOI). Borehole compensation is important because it 

significantly reduces the effects of borehole rugosity. 

The arcVISION tool can operate in memory mode or in real-time mode in combination with the 

TeleScope MWD tool; it can also be combined with any other LWD tool. 

 



 

21 

Three factors have a considerable influence in depth of investigation (DOI): 

? Distance from transmitter (T) to receiver (R) (as greater is the distance T/R, the deeper 

is the DOI); 

? Signal frequency (the lower the frequency the deeper the DOI); 

? Type of measurement (phase shift reads are more shallow than attenuation). 

 

Mode of operation (see Figure 2.10 and Figure 2.11): 

? The current from the top transmitter induces an electromagnetic field within the 

formation; 

? This propagates away from the transmitter; 

? The wave induces a current at the receivers; 

? The phase and amplitude of the wave are measured and converted to resistivity.

3. CASE STUDY 

This study investigates a block and five exploration wells whose names have been changed in 

order to keep certain privileged information confidential. This section describes the 

geographical and geological characteristics of the Block Michocho and the wells available. 

 

3.1 Geographical and Geological Settings of Block Michocho 

3.1.1 Geographical Settings  

Block Michocho is an exploration and production block located in the West of the Luanda 

province, in the region of the capital of Angola. The main operator of these fields is the 

Company Total EP Angola. A set of wells closer to the operated fields were chosen to 

characterize anisotropy in the Block Michoho. Figure 3.1 shows location of the five exploration 

as well as a set of development wells named “Dona”.

3.1.2 Geological Settings 

The Block Michocho is located at the SouthWestern edge of the huge Lower Congo Basin, 

mainly of Tertiary Period. The structural evolution is attributed to a westward regional thin-

skinned extension that has been affecting the Upper Cretaceous to current sedimentary cover 

since the Albian. 

The Aptian “Loeme” salt layer corresponds to the basal detachment level which permitted the 

westward gravity gliding of the sedimentary cover above a pre-Aptian passive deposits. 

From east to west, the Block Michocho’s passive margin is divided into four main tectonic 

domains with contrasted deformation styles (Figure 3.2): (1) stable, (2) proximal extensional (3) 

transitional and (4) Compressional. 

The Middle Miocene – Upper Miocene (M-UM) area is located in the proximal-extensional 

domain marked by numerous listric and normal faults separating some tectonic rafts of 

Cretaceous, Eocene and Oligocene series separated by huge compensation graben (as the NW-

SE oriented Oligocene E Graben) which are unfilled by Miocene to actual series. 

During the Pliocene Period, the area was characterized by a significant increase in tectonic 

sliding activity that created a typical turtleback anticline westward and a thick Plio-Pleistocene 

depot-centre above the M-UM area and eastward (graben). 

 

 

Figure 3.2 Location of block Michocho (Source: TEPA). 

 

According to the combination of numerous faults and sand levels overall, the sedimentary series 

(Lower Miocene, Middle Miocene, Upper Miocene) M and UM present the same source rocks, 

pathway and timing migration.  



 

25 

According to a technical report of TEPA, the Middle Miocene interval is constituted of channel-

levee turbidity complexes and initial lobe deposits. Lower Miocene interval is constituted by 

sand lobes and slightly erosive sandy channels, which are more or less canalized by graben axis. 

The lithology of the Block Michocho is composed predominantly of sand, shale, laminations of 

sand-shale and turbidity’s sequences from the Oligocene series. (see Figure 3.3).

           (6) 

One study objectives is to check in each well (table 3.1) if the computed horizontal resistivity 

(  ) matches with horizontal resistivity measured with the logging. If the matches verify in the 

five wells, we can conclude that Equation (5) serves to make correction of the anisotropy in 

resistivity. It is very important to know the coefficient of anisotropy that we have to use in that 

formula. 

 

3.4 Validation of the Formula and Results Well by Well 

The same procedure was applied for the five exploration wells as mentioned. The results are 

present in a sequence of graphics subdivided by well and stratigraphy to better understand the 

behaviour of the formation anisotropy in the resistivity. 

First, to restrict the shale points, a gamma ray versus depth graph was plotted. A threshold of 

75API was used to separate shale. It is important to take into account that neither all gamma ray 

above 75API is shale, as it is possible to find micro-carbonaceous specks, organic matter and 

other materials with high radioactive. Second, boxes of intervals of shale from the plot of 



 

29 

gamma ray versus depth were selected and correlated with resistivity and anisotropy in the same 

depth to produce an expedited interpretation. 

 

3.4.1 Joia Well 

Figure 3.7 displays the plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth 

for Joia; stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. 

 

 

Figure 3.7 Joia well: plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth separated by 

stratigraphy. 

 

Concerning Joia well: 

? The depth is more in Upper Miocene and the material is turbidity. 

? Shale points (were gamma ray are above 75API, black line) are delimited by green 

boxes to better visualize the correspondent values in resistivity and anisotropy.  

? The inclination of Joia well increases until 24º and stabilize. Therefore, the impact of 

deviation on the anisotropy with depth is insignificant. 



 

30 

? Within the depth range between 1480m and 1590m (first box) resistivity is around 

0.85?m representing a massive claystone interval (TEPA technical report). 

? Between depths 1650m and 1700m, gamma ray decreases abruptly and becomes 

almost proportional to the increase of resistivity. This interval is predominantly 

sandstone; by correlation with the plot of resistivity in that zone, an expedited 

interpretation reveals that it corresponds to on oil reservoir. A similar situation occurs 

at depths between 1900m and 2000m. 

? The righter plot of the Figure indicates an increase of anisotropy with depth. The 

Figure 3.8 shows that increase with more detail. 

 

 

Figure 3.8 Joia well: plots of gamma ray and recorded coefficient of anisotropy with depth. Red lines 

represent trends of anisotropy within the shale intervals. 

 

 



 

31 

? From the correlation between the plot of gamma ray (green boxes) and anisotropy in 

depth, it is observed an increase of anisotropy in the low permeable rock formation 

(shale) (red lines). Fortunately, that evolution of anisotropy will not cause major 

changes in the resistivity. 

? The peak of gamma ray at around 1670m corresponds to the sequence of sand-shale, 

and a high peak of anisotropy in that depth was observed. That abrupt transition of 

lithology creates locally high anisotropy. 

 

Figure 3.9 demonstrates the result of Equation (5) modified to Equation (6) using the recorded 

coefficient of anisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the 

horizontal resistivity from the tool and computed horizontal resistivity.  

 

 

Figure 3.9 Joia well. Application and validation of Equation 5 using recorded coefficient of anisotropy. 

Left track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with horizontal 

resistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated with the matching between computed Rh 

and measured Rh. 

 



 

32 

The plot on the right shows the error, or the difference between the computed resistivity and the 

logging tool resistivity. Within the green boxes (shale points) errors are below 10%, which can 

be acceptable for the validation of the Equation (5). 

The plot of anisotropy versus depth (see Figure 3.7 and 3.8) demonstrates a range of anisotropy 

between 2 and 6. Besides the use of recorded values for coefficient of anisotropy in the equation 

5, in a second test and for sensitivity purposes three constant values for coefficient of anisotropy 

were used in the equation 5 in order to check if the results are similar. In figure 3.10, results are 

of coefficient of anisotropy equals to 3. The others plots with coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 

are in the annex. 

 

 

Figure 3.10 Joia well. Validation of the equation 5 using constant coefficient of anisotropy equals to 3 and 

computed error. 

 

The results show that there is no substantial difference between the plots with recorded or 

constant coefficient of anisotropy of Equation 5 and the error associated is almost the same in 

the shale points. Similar results are obtained for the remaining coefficient of anisotropy values 2 

and 6 (see annex). 



 

33 

In order to understand the evolution of anisotropy and its relationship with gamma ray in depth, 

Figure 3.11 displays a scattergram of those two variables in three intervals of shale.  

 

 

 

Figure 3.11 Joia well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) within shale 

intervals. 

 

Despite a strong dispersion of values, Figure 3.11 enables to observe that the anisotropy 

increase with GR and both increases in depth, due to compaction of material, where sediments 

are undergoing to reorganization and they create laminations of different materials.  

 

3.4.2 Obika well 

Figure 3.12 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; 

stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. 

Concerning Obika well: 

? Obika well stratigraphy sits in Upper Miocene with predominance of sand and shale. 

? A gamma ray cut-off of 75API (black line) to get shale points was also applied, which 

are identified by grey boxes. 

? Obika well is vertical; therefore, anisotropy will not have impact in the resistivity.  



 

34 

 
Figure 3.12 Obika well: plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth 

separated by stratigraphy. 

 

? At the interval between 1480m and 1800m, (selected box) a massive claystone is 

identified (TEPA technical report).  

? Between depth 1800 and 1900m gamma ray decreases abruptly, and becomes almost 

proportional to the increase of resistivity. This interval contains predominantly 

sandstone; the behaviour of resistivity in that zone suggests a correspondence to an oil 

reservoir.  

? After the oil reservoir, at a depth between 1900m and 2500m a massive claystone 

occur again. 

 

Figure 3.13 shows the application and validation of the equation (5) using recorded coefficient 

of anisotropy for each point of depth and the error (differences) between the values of the 

horizontal resistivity from the logging tool and the computed horizontal resistivity. 

 



 

35 

 

Figure 3.13 Obika well. Application and validation of equation 5 using recorded coefficient of anisotropy. 

Left track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with horizontal 

resistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated to the matching between computed Rh and 

measured Rh. 

 

The center plot shows Computed Horizontal Resistivity (blue line) matching with Horizontal 

Resistivity (red line) from the tool. From the selected box, the error matching between the 

computed horizontal resistivity and the horizontal resistivity from the logging tool is quite 

always below 10%.  

Again, in the figure 3.14, the computed horizontal resistivity uses a coefficient of anisotropy of 

3. In annex plots with coefficient of anisotropy of 2 and 6 are presented. Both plots using record 

or constant coefficient of anisotropy on equation (5) get the same results and the error 

associated are almost the same in the shale points. The plot of validation of the equation (5) 

using coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 present the same results (see annex).  

Finally, figure 3.15 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of 

shale.

and error associated. 

 

 

Figure 3.15 Obika well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) within shale 

intervals. 



 

37 

Obika well is vertical and it is a shallow well hence, anisotropy has a lower range interval when 

compared for instance with Joia well. The scattergram between anisotropy and gamma ray in 

these three intervals of shale points does not give good answers about the behaviour of both 

parameters in depth. There is a small increase in anisotropy but it is not expressive to support 

the idea that anisotropy increase with depth due to compaction. 

 

3.4.3 Moyo Well 

Figure 3.16 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; 

stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. 

 

 

Figure 3.16 Moyo well. Plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth 

separated by stratigraphy. 

 

Concerning Moyo well: 

? Moyo well sits in Lower Miocene shale, sand and laminations of sand-shale occurs. 



 

38 

? A gamma ray cut-off of 75API (black line) was made to get shale data, which are 

identified by green boxes. 

? Moyo well is vertical; therefore, anisotropy will not have an impact on resistivity. 

? From depth 1600m to 1700m, (selected box) resistivity represents claystone (TEPA 

technical report).  

? At depth 1730m there is an interval in which gamma ray decreases, indicating the 

presence of sand sediment and resistivity increases indicating the presence of an oil 

reservoir. 

? Gamma ray presents many peaks below 75 API. Those peaks represent sequences of 

sand-shale. 

? At depth of 2100m gamma ray is very low which indicates a sand interval. The same 

depth presents decreasing resistivity, which indicates the presence of a water reservoir. 

? Moyo well is vertical; but the behaviour of anisotropy is unlike Obika well. That 

happens because of the sand-shale sequence. The transitions of lithology are 

macroscopically anisotropic. 

Once again, Figure 3.17 demonstrates the application and validation of Equation (5) using the 

recorded coefficient of anisotropy for each point of depth and the error (differences) between 

the values of the horizontal resistivity from the logging tool and the computed horizontal 

resistivity. 

The plot in the center shows a good match between both true and computed horizontal 

resistivity (respectively the red and the blue lines). From the green box, the error or differences 

in resistivity are below 10% in shale zones.  

Figure 3.18 shows the computed horizontal resistivity with the constant 3 as coefficient of 

anisotropy. The plots with coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 are included as attachments to this 

paper. 

There is no substantial difference between the plots using record or constant coefficients of 

anisotropy on Equation (5); the error associated is almost the same in the shale points. The plot 

of validation of Equation 5 using coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 present the same results (see 

annex). 

Finally, figure 3.19 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of 

shale.

Figure 3.17 Moyo well. Application and validation of equation 5 using recorded coefficient of anisotropy. 

Left track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with horizontal 

resistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated to the matching between computed Rh and

Figure 3.19 Moyo well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) in shale 

intervals. 



 

41 

 

The Moyo well is vertical and shallow hence, anisotropy has a low expression. The crossplot 

between anisotropy and gamma ray does not provides a good reading concerning to the 

behaviour of anisotropy with depth in shale intervals. 

 

3.4.4 Samalesso well 

Figure 3.20 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; 

stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. 

Concerning Samalesso well: 

? The Samalesso well sits in Miocene and Oligocene formations, and consists of 

predominantly shale, sand and trace micro carbonaceous specks, that is occasionally 

sub-laminated with organic matter, slightly to very dolomitic. 

? Gamma ray presents high values in both Miocene and Oligocene formations. This 

probably occurs because of the presence of organic matter. 

? We define a gamma ray cut-off of 80API (black line) to select shale points. The 

gamma ray box includes shale intervals to verify what happens in the evolution of the 

plots of resistivity versus depth. 

 



 

42 

 

Figure 3.20 Samalesso well. Plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy with depth 

separated by stratigraphical units. 

 

? According to the plot of gamma ray versus depth, intervals from depths of 2800m to 

2840m, from 3120m to 3140m and 3270m to 3380m indicate a large amount of sand. 

The correlation of these intervals with the plot of resistivity indicates an oil reservoir.  

? The Samalesso well has an inclination of 50º; therefore, anisotropy will have a impact 

on the resistivity. 

? Anisotropy presents many high peaks in both formations because of the variation of 

the lithology along the depth. 

? The plot of anisotropy versus depth reveals many high peaks in the zones of a change 

of sediments, for instance, a sequence of sand-shale. 

 

Figure 3.21 plots the application and validation of Equation (5) using a recorded coefficient of 

anisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the measure horizontal 

resistivity and computed horizontal resistivity. 



 

43 

 

 

Figure 3.21 Samalesso well. Application and validation of equation 5 using recorded coefficient of 

anisotropy. Left track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching 

with horizontal resistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated to the matching between 

computed Rh and measured Rh. 

 

The plot in the center shows computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching well with 

horizontal resistivity (red line) from the logging tool. From selected box, the matching error 

between computed horizontal resistivity and horizontal resistivity from the tool is below 10% in 

shale zones. 

 

Figure 3.22, the computed horizontal resistivity uses a coefficient of anisotropy 3. The plots 

with coefficients of anisotropy 2 and 6 are included in the annex. There is no substantial 

difference between the plots using record or constant coefficients of anisotropy in Equation (5) 

and the error associated is almost the same in the shale points. The plot of validation of 

Equation (5) using coefficients of anisotropy 2 and 6 present the same results (see annex). 

 



 

44 

 

Figure 3.22 Samalesso well. Validation of the equation 5 using constant coefficient of anisotropy of 3 and 

error associated. 

 

Finally, Figure 3.23 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of 

shale. 

 

 



 

45 

 

Figure 3.23 Samalesso well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) in shale 

intervals. 

 

In the scattergram, anisotropy is disseminated in every part of both formations; it is very high. 

The Samalesso well has a high deviation and it is deeper than all wells; hence, anisotropy will 

produce huge impact on resistivity. 

 

3.4.5 Lango well 

Figure 3.24 displays a plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy by depth; 

stratigraphic units are showed at the left part of the graphic. 

Concerning Lango well: 

? The Lango well sits in a Miocene formation, and consists of predominantly shale, sand 

and many sequences of sand-shale. 

? Gamma ray presents many peaks of low values that represent sequences of sand-shale. 

The correlation of these peaks in the plot of resistivity corresponds to the presence of 

oil reservoirs. 

 



 

46 

 

Figure 3.24 Lango well. Plot of gamma ray, inclination, resistivity log and anisotropy all with depth 

separated by stratigraphy. 

 

? A gamma ray cut-off of 80API (black line) was defined to select shale points. From 

gamma ray the boxes shows shale intervals to verify what happens in the evolution of 

the plots of resistivity versus depth. 

? The depths below 1800m low values of gamma ray are observed, which corresponds 

to sandstone. When correlating it in the plot of resistivity, that zone shows the 

presence of a water reservoir. We can find the same scenario in depth of 2600m.  

? The depth below 2200m presents a similar situation in gamma ray but the resistivity 

shows the opposite behaviour corresponding to the presence of an oil reservoir. 

? Anisotropy reveals some high peaks in the zones of change of sediments for example, 

sequences of sand-shale. The depth 2200m is the best example of the presence of a 

sequence of sand-shale.  

 



 

47 

Figure 3.25 plots the application and validation of Equation 5 using recorded coefficient of 

anisotropy for each point of depth and the error between the matches of the measure horizontal 

resistivity and computed horizontal resistivity. 

 

 

Figure 3.25 Lango well. Application and validation of equation 5 using recorded coefficient of 

anisotropy. Left track: gamma ray; middle track: computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching 

with horizontal resistivity (red line) from the tool; right track: error associated to the matching between 

computed Rh and measured Rh. 

 

The plot in the center shows computed horizontal resistivity (blue line) matching with measure 

horizontal resistivity (red line). In the green box, we see the error of the matching between 

computed horizontal resistivity and horizontal resistivity from the tool is below 10%. 

Figure 3.26, the computed horizontal resistivity has in its coefficient of anisotropy the constant 

3. The plots of equation (5) with coefficients of anisotropy 2 and 6 are included in attachments 

to this paper. 

 



 

48 

 

Figure 3.26 Lango well. Validation of Equation 5 using constant coefficient of anisotropy 3 and error

As the previous wells, there is no substantial difference between the plots using record or 

constant coefficient of anisotropy in Equation (5) and the error associated is almost the same in 

the shale points. The plot of validation of equation (5) using coefficient of anisotropy 2 and 6 

present the same results (see annex).

Finally, Figure 3.27 displays a scattergram of anisotropy and gamma ray in the intervals of 

shale. 

 

 

Figure 3.27 Lango well. Scattergram between anisotropy (x-axis) and gamma ray (y-axis) in shale 

intervals. 

 

The Lango well is vertical and shallow hence, anisotropy is not expressed. The scattergram 

between anisotropy and gamma ray does not provide a good explanation for the behaviour of 

anisotropy with depth in shale intervals.

3.5 Characterization of the Anisotropy 

Figure 3.28 shows the trend of anisotropy with depth in the five exploration wells 

simultaneously. The global visualization clearly exhibits an increasing trend of the anisotropy 

with depth in the five exploration wells of Block Michocho. 

 

  

Figure 3.28 Global trend of anisotropy with depth. 

 

 

 

Figure 3.29 explain the increase of anisotropy in depth. Along the depth, sediments are 

compacted and they reorganized themselves, creating laminations of material with different 

properties. Because of that, the logging tool reads vertical resistivity greater than the horizontal 

resistivity when cross over different layers along the depth. As the anisotropy is the ratio 

between vertical and horizontal resistivity, the greater the depth the greater anisotropy will be.

Impact of ? on Rt  Reasonable Very low Very low High Very low 

 

From the plots of the five wells, a range of anisotropy values with depth was obtained being  

possible to quantify and qualify the impact of the anisotropy on resistivity. Of the five 

exploration wells, Samalesso is the well most affected well by the anisotropy due its high 

inclination. 



 

52 

The shale of the Oligocene formation is very anisotropic as shown in Table 3.4. A simple 

explanation for this is that Oligocene is a deeper formation than Miocene. Therefore, resistivity 

in that formation will be affected manly in high deviated wells.

4. APPLICATION OF THE CORRECTION ON A DEVELOPMENT WELL 

4.1 Dona 761 Well 

The Dona 761 is one of a set development wells that sit between Middle Miocene and Lower 

Miocene series. Dona 761 has a maximum deviation of 80º and the measure resistivity is 

unrealistic due to the anisotropy effect. Hence, it is important to correct the resistivity acquired 

at Dona 761 well, in order to make a better interpretation in the pore pressure prediction. Figure 

4.1 shows the correction of the observed resistivity using different constants coefficients of 

anisotropy of 2, 3 and 6. 

 

Figure 4.1 Dona development well. Plot on the left shows correction of the observed resistivity (red line) 

using minimum, mean and maximum coefficient of anisotropy. Plot on the right shows the inclination of 

Dalia well with depth. 

 

The application of Equation (5) to correction of resistivity of this development well presents 

different curves for different coefficients of anisotropy. From that plot, it is difficult to know 

which curve is the proper curve to use in the pore pressure prediction. Therefore, Equation (5) 

cannot be used with a constant coefficient of anisotropy. The solution found for the calibration 

of the coefficient of anisotropy based in the normal compaction trend of shale resistivity.  



 

54 

 

4.2 Calibration of the Coefficient of Anisotropy 

According Eaton, the normal resistivity (Rn) is a function of the burial depth. Therefore, it is 

possible to calibrate the coefficient of anisotropy using the normal compaction condition of both 

vertical and horizontal resistivity. 

      
     (7) 

 

Where    is the shale resistivity with normal compaction condition;    is the shale resistivity in 

the mudline;   is the constant; and   is the depth below the mudline. 

We calculate the constant b through the global trend of both vertical and horizontal resistivity of 

the five exploration wells applying a value of z (z=5000m) greater than all the wells of Block 

Michocho. Once we have the constant b, we calculate both vertical and horizontal normal shale 

resistivity for the five exploration wells. 

From the ratio between vertical and horizontal resistivity (Equation 8), it is possible to get the 

coefficient of anisotropy in the normal compaction condition. 

 

           
     ;              

     ;

Figure 4.2 shows the application of Equation (8) to obtain a global trend of both horizontal and 

vertical normal shale resistivity and the global trend of anisotropy in depth. 



 

55 

 

Figure 4.2 Horizontal and vertical resistivity of the wells. The lines showing the trend of resistivity 

resulted from equation 2. The line in the global resulted from the ratio between vertical and horizontal 

resistivity. Righ plot shows the calculated trend for anisotropy. 

 

4.3 Impact of the Anisotropy in Resistivity 

The presence of an anisotropic formation in deviated wells or in wells in which bedding is 

inclined relative to the wellbore can result in significant deviations in induction log response.  

Three exploration wells with different relative dip to the bedding were chosen to evaluate the 

impact of the anisotropy on their apparent resistivity (see Figure 4.3).  

We get the impact of the anisotropy by comparing the corrected resistivity curve (blue line) 

regarding to the measure true resistivity (red line) of the three exploration wells as the slope of 

the wells increases.

Figure 4.3 Log plots of observed resistivity and corrected resistivity for three wells with different 

deviation. The corrected resistivities in the more highly deviated wells are generally consistent with the 

resistivities recorded in the nearly vertical well, which is nearly perpendicular to the bedding. 

 

According to Figure 4.3, the first track is a vertical well, in which both observed and corrected 

resistivity have the same result. This means that, in the vertical wells it is not necessary correct 

the anisotropy. 

The second track of the Joia well presents a well with 24º inclination. In that well, anisotropy 

has an insignificant impact and is observed recorded corrected resistivity that differ from 

recorded observed resistivity at a certain depth. 

The third track is Samalesso well, which has a 50º inclination, and corrected resistivity lower 

than the observed resistivity. That formation is very deep and anisotropic; therefore, we have 

values of the deep induction log that are significantly larger in deviated wells than in vertical 

wells. 

That corrected resistivity is correct measurement to use to estimate of pore pressure. Figure 4.4 

below demonstrates the impact of the anisotropy in a set of curves of resistivity of development 

wells. All these wells have high inclination and give unrealistic resistivity values. Even in the 

Figure 4.4, on the right track are the respective corrections of these curves, which are more 



 

57 

coherent, with resistivity values closer to the resistivity values of vertical wells, which are 

resistivity’s parallel to the bedding plane.

the wells; on the right track: corrected resistivity of the development wells. 

 

The high inclination of the development wells changes completely the observed resistivity due 

to the anisotropy environment. Equation (5) corrects the global trend of the resistivity to the 

vertical direction. The present corrected resistivity is appropriate for  use in pore pressure 

prediction.

5. AN EXAMPLE OF PORE PRESSURE PREDICTION 

5.1 Lango Well 

Lango is a vertical well hence, it is not necessary to correct its resistivity. Lango resistivity is 

ready to be used in the pore pressure prediction. 

The log resistivity of Figure 5.1 is only from shale points, and fluids in these formations are 

under much pressure. Pore pressure prediction was performed using the Equation (4) given by 

Eaton (1975). That requires calculating the pressure in a rock formation with low permeability 

such as shale.  

                   
 

  
   (4) 

 

Where     is the formation pore pressure gradient;     is the overburden stress gradient;     is 

the hydrostatic pore pressure gradient (normally 0.465psi/ft or 1.03MPa/km, dependent on 

water salinity);   is log the shale resistivity;    is the shale resistivity normal compacted trend, 

  is the exponent constant ranging from 0.6 to 1.5, and normally  =1.2 (Zhang, 2011).

pore pressure prediction.

From gamma ray and resistivity, shale points were filtered. Therefore, the pressure inferred in 

the resistivity of the Lango well is all from low permeability formation. At lower depths the 

pressure is normal but at a certain depth the pressure increases more than the normal pressure. 

The selected area on the resistivity plot shows oil reservoir and water reservoir under much 

pressured. An overpressure can be identified in the right track of Figure 5.1. The track on the 

right demonstrates pore pressure in the shale. From the normal pressure of the water and the 

(respectively, 1.525psi/m and 3.28psi/m), we calculate the pressure until depth 3300m. 

Hydrostatic pressure is under redline. The phenomenon of overpressure is between the 

hydrostatic pressure and the overburden gradient. Overpressure is what we want to avoid in 

drilling activity. Hence, we have to report the above situation to the department of the company 

that will design future wells in the Block Michocho. 

 

5.2 Benefits and Disadvantages of the Correction of Resistivity 

The correction of anisotropy in resistivity from wells with high relative dips serves to obtain the 

resistivity parallel to a bedding plan; that resistivity is appropriate in pore pressure prediction. 

Although the details of the logs are different, corrected resistivity recorded are more consistent 

than observed resistivity. Anisotropy correction gives results more closely resemble to logs 

from vertical wells. 

Application of Equation (5) requires horizontal resistivity logs, which are logs obtained with 

wireline induction tools that are very expensive. Before using Equation (5) to correct resistivity, 

the Equation must be validated for the field that we want to investigate. That requires to have 

available all log data of the parameter involved in the Equation. 

For this study, the calibration of the coefficient of anisotropy did not utilize a unique coefficient. 

We have to use a mean of the normal resistivity shale of the field. 

The correction of anisotropy reduces resistivity logs used to estimate reserves. 

Corrected resistivity curves from Equation (5), when validated are appropriate for pore pressure 

prediction.

6. FINAL REMARKS 

6.1 Conclusion 

Whenever anisotropy is present in a formation and a wellbore performed in that is not 

perpendicular to the bedding, having high relative dip angle, the measured induction log 

resistivities will be too large. The higher the coefficient of anisotropy, the higher the increase of 

apparent resistivity. 

In addition, there is a minimum angle of the relative well inclination required to see a significant 

impact of the anisotropy on the apparent resistivity.  

The resistivity of anisotropic rock formations relies on the horizontal resistivity of the specific 

rock formation (resistivity measured by an induction tool normal to the bedding), the coefficient 

of anisotropy, and the angle between the wellbore and a vector normal to the bedding plane.  

Shales or thinly laminated sand-shale sequences are the cause of anisotropy. In the shale 

materials in all five exploration wells, anisotropy increases with burial due to compaction, 

which reorganizes the sediments. 

Block Michocho presents an Oligocene formation more anisotropic than Miocene. The increase 

of anisotropy with compaction is the more likely explanation for this situation. 

The formula of correction of the anisotropy in resistivity was validated, with 10% as global 

error associated, which can be seen as acceptable when working with resistivity logs.  

This formula computes horizontal resistivity, the closest property measured by wireline 

induction logs, for the five exploration wells.  

In the Block Michocho, the coefficient of anisotropy reached a global range between two and 

six along the depth. This required us to use the Equation (5) with different constants of 

coefficient of anisotropy in resistivity curves of the development well highly deviated. But we 

realized during this study that making a correction with Equation (5) using a constant 

coefficient of anisotropy gives us different curves i.e for this block, there is no appropriate 

constant coefficient of anisotropy that would produce a better correction.  

It is important to calibrate the coefficient of anisotropy correctly, in order to predict/estimate the 

right shale pressure; therefore, we used the normal compaction condition (applying Eaton’s 

equation) of both vertical and horizontal shale resistivities to produce the global trend of 

coefficient of anisotropy for Block Michocho. 

From the set of curves of development wells, we see the correction of anisotropy putting 

vertical trend to the curves, and also see that the values of corrected resistivity are more 



 

62 

coherent and relatively close to the values resistivities of vertical wells, which is nearly normal 

to the bedding. 

The application of the method of pore pressure prediction in shale resistivity was performed 

successfully, which allowed us to verify that the behaviour of resistivity log with depth permits 

us to infer the pressures of the fluid within formations. From the resistivity curve, we infer the 

pressure on the well under study and could find an overpressure situation starting at depth 

1050m. We could check the overpressure using Eaton’s Equation (4) of pore pressure in shale. 

 

6.2 Recommendations on the use of the Method Developed 

To use the correction of anisotropy in pore pressure prediction is important to filter resistivity to 

select the shale points (regions). 

In the other blocks or fields, equation (5) must be validated before using to correct resistivity 

logs. A better way to make validation of equation (5) is to compare horizontal resistivity from 

induction log tool with computed horizontal resistivity for the wells where this information is 

available. 

It is not necessary to apply the correction of anisotropy in resistivity of wells that intersect 

perpendicular to the bedding because the induction logs tool gives the true resistivity, which is 

equal to horizontal resistivity. 

To correct more accurately the curves of resistivity it is better to calibrate the coefficient of 

anisotropy using the normal compaction condition.
