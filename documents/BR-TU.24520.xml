ABSTRACT - The experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% water restriction
(WR) on broiler performance, behavior, organ development (heart, leg, proventriculus and gizzard, liver, and intestines),
and intestinal micrometry. Four hundred and eighty ROSS 308 male broilers were raised in battery cages measuring 0.72 m2,
from 1 to 21 days of age. Feed was offered ad libitum, and environmental temperatures were kept in thermoneutral
conditions. Water intake was estimated based on a control group, two days older than the experimental birds, with same
initial weight. A linear reduction on bird performance, duodenal villi height, and fresh organs weight were observed as WR
increased. At 21 days of age, for each 1% WR, a weight loss of 8.5 g was observed. However, the mortality rate was not
affected by any WR level. Organ weight, relative to body weight, was not affected by WR, except for heart, which weight
increased with WR. Villi numbers and crypts depth were not affected by WR. Birds under WR changed their behavior,
becoming aggressive and irritated. Electron microscopy data showed higher villi extrusion in WR broilers. In conclusion,
WR, regardless its magnitude, should be avoided in broiler production.

Influência da restrição de água no desempenho e no desenvolvimento dos
órgãos de frangos de corte

RESUMO - Avaliou-se a influência da restrição de água (0, 10, 20, 30 e 40%) no desempenho, no comportamento e
desenvolvimento de orgãos (coração, perna, proventrículo e moela, fígado e intestinos) e na micrometria intestinal de frangos
de corte. Utilizaram-se 480 machos, linhagem ROSS 308, do 1o ao 21o dia de idade, criados em gaiolas de 0,72 m2. As aves
receberam dieta basal à vontade e foram mantidas em temperatura de conforto térmico. O consumo de água foi estimado em
um grupo de aves controle, dois dias mais velhas que as aves experimentais, porém com o mesmo peso inicial. As medidas de
desempenho foram tomadas semanalmente e o consumo de água, diariamente. Aos 21 dias, 18 aves por nível de restrição
(tratamento) foram sacrificadas para realização das medidas de micrometria intestinal (6 aves) e do peso de órgãos (12 aves).
Diariamente, observou-se o comportamento das aves durante o período de fornecimento da água. O desempenho das aves, a
altura das vilosidades duodenais e os pesos frescos dos órgãos reduziram de forma linear de acordo com o aumento da restrição
de água. Aos 21 dias de idade, a cada 1% de restrição de água, houve perda de 8,5 g no ganho de peso. No entanto, a mortalidade
não foi afetada por qualquer nível de restrição de água. Não foi encontrada diferença na profundidade de cripta, no número
de vilos e no peso relativo dos orgãos (em relação ao peso corporal), exceto do coração, que aumentou com a restrição de água.
Nas aves sob restrição de água, houve maior extrusão dos vilos. Os frangos submetidos à restrição de água alteraram seu
comportamento, tornando-se agressivos e irritadiços. A restrição de água, independentemente de sua magnitude, deve ser
evitada na criação de frangos de corte.

Introduction

Water is considered the most important nutrient for
animals. While growth rate, uniformity and health are
common problems in commercial production, water quality

and consumption are usually not taken into consideration
(Counotte, 2003). Water intake per animal and feed
intake:water consumption ratios of modern broiler genetic
strains are higher when compared to non-selected broilers.
The growth rate capacity of modern broiler strains (around

55 to 60 g/day) makes water essential. Water restriction
reduces broiler performance (Bruno &amp;amp; Macari, 2002). Marks
(1981) compared non-selected and selected fast growing
commercial strain broilers (Cobb) and observed that water
intake was higher for the fast growing strain, with feed and
water provided ad libitum. The selected strain broilers,
restricted to the same water intake as that of the non-
selected strain broilers, presented worse feed conversion.
These findings indicate that water intake may play a major
role in facilitating the genetic potential for growth. Kellerup
et al. (1965) observed water restriction effects in broilers
from one to eight weeks of age. Body weight and feed
consumption decreased with each water restriction
increment, but the mortality rate was not significant among
restriction levels (up to 50%). When ad libitum in water
intake was reduced in 20 percent or more, feed conversion
was impaired. Age and increments in water restriction levels
reduced the water:feed consumption ratio.

Water restriction is related to a typical stress behavior,
with muscular motility coordination, modulated directly or
not by the neuroendocrine system (Zulkilfi &amp;amp; Siegel, 1995).
Bieres et al. (1965) observed that water deprivation for 12
hours or more had adverse effects on the chick growth
performance. Since birds are different in their ability to
conserve body water by increasing kidney resorption, it is
possible to cause dehydration in some birds by practicing
water restriction in a flock (NRC, 1994). Arad (1983) observed
that, after 48 hours of water deprivation, dehydrated birds
presented slightly higher body temperature when compared
to normally hydrated birds. Dehydrated fowls were capable
of recovering 92% of the initial body weight within 30 min
of drinking. However, birds that lost more than 15% of their
weight failed to recover it. In addition, since feed intake is
related to water intake, any factor interfering with feed
intake affects water intake (Macari, 1995).

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the
effect of four water supply levels on broiler performance,
behavior, development of legs, heart, proventriculus and
gizzard, liver and intestines, and duodenal histology and
morphology by scanning electron microscopy.

Material and Methods

Four hundred and eighty Ross 308 male chicks were
submitted to five treatments based on water restriction
during a 21-day experimental period. The following
treatments were applied: 100% - ad libitum water supply;
90%-90% daily water supply (10% restriction); 80%-80%
daily water supply (20% restriction); 70%-70% daily water

supply (30% restriction); 60%-60% daily water supply
(40% restriction). The experiment was carried out in an
environmentally controlled room, and the birds were
housed in battery cages measuring 0.72 m2 equipped with
feeders and baby drinkers (one per cage). A randomized
complete block design was used, with five treatments and
six replicates of 14 chickens per treatment. The blocks were
established based on the initial body weight. According to
that, chicks were divided into three weight groups (light
– below 44.3 g, intermediate- between 44.4 and 47.2, and
heavy- above 47.3 g).

Ad libitum water supply was estimated based on a
control group of six replicates of 10 chicks per replicate. The
control group was housed in battery cages in the same
room, two days before the beginning of the experiment. The
chicks had the same initial weight as the experimental ones.
Water consumption in this group was used as reference to
establish the amount of water to be supplied to birds from
the restricted treatments. In the restricted treatments, water
was supplied once a day, around 12:00 am. The chick
behavior was daily observed during water supply and for
the next two hours.

The same diet was offered ad libitum to chicks
from all treatments. It contained 22% of crude protein,
3100 kcal/kg of AME, 1.26% of Total Lys , 0.94% of Total
Met-Cys, 1.0% of Calcium, and 0.5% of available
Phosphorus. Chicks were provided 24 hours of light, and
the room temperature was adjusted according to the
ROSS 308 manual (AgRoss, 2000).

Feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG) and feed conversion
ratio (FCR) were weekly evaluated, whereas water
consumption (WC) was daily evaluated. At 21 days of age,
two chickens per replicate were sacrificed, and heart, liver,
proventriculus+gizzard (P+gizzard), small+large intestine,
and deboned leg were collected and weighed. Relative
organ weight was calculated by dividing the weight of the
part by the bird’s body weight. The dry matter content of
organs and legs was determined (AOAC, 1993).

A third chicken per replicate was sacrificed to collect two
centimeters of the duodenum, at the pancreatic region. The
sample was washed with de-ionized water and kept in plastic
flasks, with buffered formalin at 10% in order to determine
villi number (VN), villi height (VH), and crypt depth (CD).
Also, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age, the duodenum of a fourth
chicken was collected, washed with de-ionized water, and the
samples were prepared for electron microscopy reading.

Data were analyzed through ANOVA and regression
analysis, and the means were compared by Tukey test
(SAS, 2000).

Influence of water restriction on the performance and organ development of young broilers

Results and Discussion

The water consumption between chicks from the control
group and chicks receiving water ad libitum were
compared and no differences were observed. Therefore,
keeping birds with the same initial weight, but two days
older than the experimental group resulted in an acceptable
way to estimate the water intake.

The different chick initial weights (blocks) did not show
significant effect in any analysis.

Weekly data are not presented because the responses
were quite similar to data obtained for the total experimental
period (1 to 21 days). Water restriction caused severe
reduction in broiler performance, as demonstrated in Table 1.
Data show a linear reduction (P&lt;0.0001) of feed intake (FI)
and weight gain (WG) as water restriction increased. As
demonstrated through the regression equation, for each
1% of water restriction, 8.5 g of body weight were lost
within 21 days. Nilipoul &amp;amp; Butcher (1998) demonstrated
that water-restricted chickens, even if restricted for few
hours, stop growing.

The feed conversion ratio also presented linear increase
as water restriction levels increased. However, the
determination coefficient of the regression analysis was
lower than those of the other variables. The Tukey test also
showed that increases on the water restriction levels did not
have a clear relationship with FCR. Restriction levels of 10,
30, and 40% resulted in equal FCR. Kellerup et al. (1965)
found no differences in FCR either, when chickens were
submitted to 10% of water restriction. These researchers
observed that chickens submitted to 20 and 30% of water
restriction showed significant performance differences
only at the 7th week of age. However, when 40 and 50% of
water restriction was applied, differences were already
observed at the 4th week of age. These contradictory data
may be related to one of the most important factors interfering
with water consumption, which is genetics (Penz &amp;amp; Vieira,
2002). Modern strains are very different from the strain used
by Kellerup et al. (1965), with a higher weight gain capacity.
Each day of water restriction is meaningful for the
performance of modern broilers due to the lower number of
days required for birds to be ready for market.

The water restriction did not affect chicken livability.
These results are consistent with those found by Kellerup
et al. (1965). In fact, birds tried to adapt themselves to
adverse conditions. Although the absolute weight of all
organs and legs was reduced in function of the increment
of water restriction levels (data not shown), Table 2 shows
that when the water supply levels decreased, no difference

was observed in tissue weights in relation to the body
weight. Data indicated that the reduction in tissue weight
was proportional to the reduction in body weight, regardless
the water restriction level. Only heart relative weight (HW)
increased as water supply levels decreased. These results
may be explained by the higher blood viscosity caused by
water restriction. This phenomenon was visually observed
when birds were sacrificed. Buhr et al. (1998) studied the
effect of feed restriction and observed opposite results.

In terms of dry matter, only the leg dry matter increased
with water restriction, regardless the supply level (24.8% x
26.4%). Davis et al. (1988) observed in newly-hatched
chicks that leg skin is the area that undergoes the fastest
dehydration when compared as to other areas and it is used
as an emergency water source during osmotic stress periods,
when water is lacking. Although not found in literature for
older broilers, this phenomenon may explain the results
observed.

Another evidence of coping was that treatments did
not affect the water intake: feed intake ratios, which were
always 2:1, regardless the water supply level. These ratios
are the same as those reported in literature (NRC, 1994).

When water is offered ad libitum, chickens develop a
very characteristic feed intake pattern. However, this pattern
can change according to the water availability and
management (Macari, 1995). In this experiment, chickens
submitted to water restriction showed a non-conventional
behavior, which was maintained during the entire experi-
mental period. Without water, chickens did not eat and were
sleepy, regardless the supply level. Water restriction can
increase heart rate, respiratory frequency, cloacal temperature,
in addition of causing sleepiness, pain at the body
extremities, blood concentration increase, blood volume

reduction, and blood circulation reduction. These effects
may cause nausea and appetite reduction (Lloyd et al.,
1978). In the present study, in the presence of humans, the
birds were excited, running, and jumping into the cages.
When water was offered to birds, some started to peck other
chicken’s toes. When water-restricted chickens received
water, they tried to drink it all very fast, in approximately two
hours, regardless the restriction levels. It was possible to
observe that the limit of water consumption was the crop
size, which was enlarged. Chicks usually consumed feed
after drinking.  However, they frequently regurgitated water
due to the presence of feed. After satisfied of water, birds
were often seen watering their bodies. After eating, they
started to produce excreta within two hours, in two separated
forms (solid excreta and water, showing a rapid water transit
and a possible decrease in its absorption). Lloyd et al.
(1978), Yu et al. (1990), and Brooks (1994) also described
similar behaviors in chickens submitted to water restriction.

Water restriction did not affect villi number and crypt
depth. However, there was a linear reduction in villi height
(Table 3). Dibner et al. (1996), Geyra et al. (2001), and Penz
&amp;amp; Vieira (2002) reported that feed nutrients are essential for
mucosa metabolism. Since water restriction leads to a feed
restriction, a decrease nutrient supply to the intestine is
expected. Villi height is associated with a larger absorptive
surface due to the higher number of enterocytes capable of
absorbing nutrients (Geyra et al., 2001).

Based on scanning electron microscopy, seven-day-
old chicks submitted to water restriction showed cells
extrusion from apices villi. This fact could be explained by
the higher abrasive affect of the diet on the villi surface in
water-restricted birds (Figure 1). At 14 and 21 days of age,
the differences were more significant and increased as the
water supply levels decreased (Figure 2). The villi of chicks
not submitted to water restriction had a smooth surface, and

Influence of water restriction on the performance and organ development of young broilers

the tip was round. The villi of water-restricted chickens
presented damaged surface, with long tips, less turgid
texture, and were thinner, causing tip extrusion.

Conclusions

 Water must be considered as an essential nutrient
since its restriction caused reduction in feed intake and
weight gain and increase in the feed conversion ratio in
broilers reared from 1 to 21 days. On the other hand, water
restriction up to 40% did not increase the mortality rate
of birds kept under thermoneutral conditions.  Water
restriction did not reduce the weight of most of the organs
as a proportion of the body weight, except for heart, which
weight increased. Water restriction reduced the villi height,
but did not affect the villi number or crypt depth.

It is suggested that in further experiments on water
restriction, water should be offered often (more than once
a day) in order to prevent water spillage.
