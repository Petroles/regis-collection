AbstrAct

The aim of this study was to evaluate the deposition impact of dredged material from Patos lagoon estuary 
on a benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in an adjacent coastal marine area. Nine sampling 
stations were chosen at random in the disposal area, and nine others in the same way in an adjacent control 
area. Samples were collected at a 19 m depth before sediment disposal (11 July 2000), during dredging 
and disposal operations (25 Oct. 2000), and three months thereafter (24 Aug. 2001). Statistical analysis 
indicated that sampling periods presented similar characteristics in both the control and disposal sites. 
Disposal of dredged sediment from Patos lagoon had no detectable detrimental effects upon macrobenthic 
faunal assemblage at the dumping site. This result is attributed both to adaptation of resident biota to 
dynamic sedimentary conditions and to the fine estuarine sediment dredged, the dispersion of which in the 
water column might have minimized sediment deposition and consequent damage to the benthic fauna.

Keywords: dredge, environmental impact, Patos lagoon, coastal zone.

resumo

efeitos da deposição de material proveniente de dragagem sobre uma associação de 
macroinvertebrados bentônicos na zona costeira do sul do brasil 

Objetivou-se avaliar o impacto da deposição de material dragado proveniente da região estuarina da lagoa 
dos Patos sobre a estrutura da associação macrobentônica no sítio de deposição, situado no ambiente 
marinho costeiro adjacente à desembocadura da laguna. Nove estações de coleta foram sorteadas, tanto 
no sítio de deposição quanto na área controle adjacente. As amostras, a 19 m de profundidade, foram 
coletadas antes do início de deposição do sedimento (11/07/2000), durante as operações de dragagem 
e deposição (25/10/2000) e três meses após o encerramento das atividades de deposição do material 
dragado (24/08/2001). Análises estatísticas indicaram que áreas controle e sítio de deposição apresentaram 
características faunísticas similares dentro dos períodos amostrais. Não foram detectados efeitos prejudiciais 
da deposição do sedimento sobre a associação de macroinvertebrados bentônicos na área de depósito. 
Este resultado pode ser atribuído às características da biota residente que está, provavelmente, adaptada 
às condições da dinâmica sedimentar do local e também às características predominantemente finas do 
sedimento dragado que, ao dispersar-se na coluna d´água, minimizaram a deposição das frações mais finas 
e um eventual dano ao macrozoobentos. 

Palavras-chave: dragagem, impacto ambiental, lagoa dos Patos, zona costeira.

Due to the relative immobility of most 
benthic organisms, sediment deposition from 
open-sea dredging may be more damaging to 
benthic macroinvertebrate communities than 
to any other member of the aquatic ecosystem, 
(Kennish, 1992; Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 1994). Studies 
have demonstrated broad differences in disposal 
effects on the macrofauna, ranging from minimal 
(van Dolah et al., 1984; Radenac et al., 1997; 
Roberts &amp;amp; Forrest, 1999; Smith &amp;amp; Rule, 2001) to 
significant community-structure changes (Rees  
et al., 1992; Harvey et al., 1998; Roberts et al., 
1998), indicating that the potential environmental 
effects of each dredging project must be evaluated 
on a case-by-case basis (Harvey et al., op cit). 

The Rio Grande Harbor is located in the 
estuarine region of Patos lagoon (southern Brazil). 
This huge coastal lagoon covers a 10,360 km2 area 
along the coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul state. 
The estuarine region occupies the southern portion 
of the lagoon and corresponds to 10% of its total 
area. Commercial navigation needs coupled with 
inadequate water depth make frequent dredging 
necessary in the Rio Grande Harbor area. Thus, 
from July 2000 to May 2001, approximately 
2,334,000 m3 of sediment were dredged from the 
harbor’s navigation channel. The dredged sediment, 
which, in estuarine region channels is composed 
predominantly of silt, clay, and fine sand (Calliari, 
1997), was deposited in a coastal region, adjacent 
to the estuarine mouth, in an approximately 3.6 km2 

area located 10 nautical miles offshore at 19-20 m 
depths. This site is delimited by the coordinates: A 
(32° 14’ 200” S and 051° 58’ 900” W); B (32° 14’ 
750” S and 051° 58’ 200” W); C (32° 15’ 700” S 
and 052° 00’ 070” W); and D (32° 16’ 210” S and 
052° 00’ 010” W). Due to the influence of the Patos 
lagoon outlet, this region suffers natural periodic 
disturbances from silt and clay deposition, which 
results in fine particle increase in relation to sand 
grains (Calliari &amp;amp; Fachin, 1993). This area is also 
impacted by deposition of sediments dislodged 
by dredging, whose effects on the marine benthic 
macroinvertebrate community are not yet known.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
the impact of dredged material deposition on the 
composition and abundance of the macrobenthic 
invertebrates in a marine coastal disposal site.

Field sampling
In the coastal marine zone nine sampling 

stations were randomly chosen in the disposal area, 
and others selected in the same way in an adjacent 
control area (Fig. 1). Samples, which were taken at 
depths of 19-20 m, were collected before sediment 
disposal (11 July 2000) within the target dumpsite 
(D1) as well as at the nine stations in the control 
area (C1). During the disposal period, the samples 
were taken on 25 Oct. 2000 (D2 and C2) and three 
months after disposal operations (24 Aug. 2001) 
at the same nine stations (D3) as well as the nine 
stations in the control area (C3). 

 At each station one sample was taken with a 
0.078 m2 van veen grab (19 x 41 cm). Samples were 
screened with a 0.5 mm pore-size nylon screen and 
the retained material was fixed in 10% formalin in 
seawater. In the laboratory all macrobenthic fauna 
– before being preserved in 70% ethanol - were 
identified with the help of a stereomicroscope and 
a microscope to the lowest possible taxon.

In July and October 2000, in the same 
area in which the biological samples were 
collected additional samples were collected to 
examine textural characteristics of area sediment.  
Grain-size structure was determined by the 
Geochemistry Laboratory of the Geosciences 
Department, FURG.

Data analysis
For each sampling station, species richness 

(expressed in number of species), density (expressed 
in number of individuals/0.078 m2), abundance 
of individuals, the Shannon-Wiener (H’) (log

e
) 

diversity index, and the Pielou evenness index (J) 
were determined for each biological sample. 

The densities of some of the species (those 
appearing to be more abundant in control or 
dumpsites, or vice-versa) were compared through 
a 1-way analysis of variance. Multivariate analyses 
were carried out for objectively identifying spatial 
changes in composition and abundance of the 
macrobenthic invertebrate communities (MDS, 
ANOSIM). The statistical analysis was carried out 
on log-transformed data (log (x + 1)) using the Bray-
Curtis similarity index. Statistical analysis was 
performed using a Primer 5.0 computer package

resuLts

 Bottom sediments sampled at the disposal 
site immediately before sediment disposal 
consisted mainly of a high silt and clay proportion. 
Sediment sampled during dumping operations at 
the same site showed an increase of the gravel and 
sand proportion (Table 1). 

Table 2 represents the most abundant taxa 
(mean density in a 0.078 m2 area), which accounted 
for more than 90% of the total abundance in each 
temporal sample. Fig. 2 shows basic descriptive 
variables for macrofaunal samples from controls 

(C) and dumping areas (D), with mean values and 
standard deviation of each variable.

Species richness displayed low variation 
between controls and the disposal sites (Fig. 2a). 
Mean values varied between 12 and 16 species in 
all sampling periods. Mean macrobenthic densities 
also showed similar values between control 
areas(C1- 55 ind/0.078 m2; C2 - 49 ind/0.078 m2; 
and C3 - 58 ind/0.078 m2) and dumpsite areas  
(D1 - 76 ind/0.078 m2; D2 - 62 ind/0.078 m2; and 
D3 - 63 ind/0.078 m2) (Fig. 2b).

Shannon diversity index (H´) was similar 
between control and dumpsites (Fig. 2c). In pre-
disposal sampling, the mean values were 2.11 at C1 
and 2.40 at D1; during disposal 2.10 was registered

at C2 and 2.08 at D2; and in post-disposal samples 
the mean values reached 1.92 at C3 and 1.98 at D3. 
The Pielou evenness index (P) followed the same 
patterns as those of the diversity index, with similar 
values between control and dumpsite samples.

In pre-disposal samples, benthic macrofaunal 
species composition was practically the same, with 
similar densities at C1 and D1 (Table 2), except 
for the higher densities of some species, e.g., the 
polychaetes Myriochele oculata (Oweniidae),

Parandalia tricuspis (Pilargidae) and Neanthes 
bruaca (Nereididae) (at least &gt; 50%) at the dumping 
area (D1). However, there was no significant 
statistical difference between the control area 
(C1) and pre-disposal site (D1) within the period 
that preceded the sediment disposal (ANOvA 
p &gt; 0.05) due to the significant density variance in 
the samples.

During dredged sediment disposal, the 
gastropod species Heleobia australis was collected 

in the disposal site and also in the control area, 
whereas it had not been registered in the sampling 
prior to the dredged material disposal (C1 and D1). 
Other polychaete species, Cirrophorus americanus 
(Paraonidae) and Magelona posterelongata 
(Magelonidae), among a few other species, were 
found in higher densities at the dumpsite (D2). 
However, the standard deviation around the mean 
of each value showed that the densities were similar 
(ANOvA, p &amp;lt;0.05).

Braz. J. Biol., 66(2A): 413-420, 2006

In post-disposal samples, the polychaete 
C. americanus densities remained high, mainly 
at the dumpsite (D3), but still without being 
statistically significant in relation to the control 
(C3). M. posterelongata and Sigambra grubei 
also presented higher densities (at least &gt; 50%) at 
the dumpsite, while Ninoe brasiliensis specimens 
were found in higher quantity in the control area. 
Similarly, the difference in density among C3 and 
D3 areas was not significant. In this period, only  
H. australis shells (without living organisms inside) 
were found.

The multi-dimensional scaling ordinations 
(MDS) and ANOSIM showed that the macrobenthic 
communities at both dumpsite and control areas 
were similar (Fig. 3). Samples from each site are 
spread throughout the plot (Fig. 3a, b, and c), though 
there is a tendency for samples to form groups with 
respect to the sampling periods (Fig. 3d). This 
temporal variability was statistically significant 
(ANOSIM).

DIscussIoN

Neither descriptive nor multivariate analytical 
methods used on the macrobenthic composition 
and abundance evidenced a distinction between 
controls, pre-disposal zones, and post-disposal 
zones. These analyses showed that control site 
samples, pre-disposal, and post-disposal target site 
samples were biologically similar. 

At first glance, dumping operations would be 
considered detrimental, mainly through smothering, 
to macrobenthic faunal assemblages, but some 
studies have demonstrated that benthic asssemblages 
show broad variation in their responses to this kind 
of disturbance. At one extreme, a study developed 
in Anse à Beufilis (eastern Canada) showed that, 
in the wake of open-sea dumping, drastic changes 
occurred in the form of a decrease in density of 
less opportunistic families and a major increase in 
the density of families with the more opportunistic 
habits (Harvey et al., 1998). Jones (1986) observed

a decrease in species number after deposition, but 
a similar number of individuals when compared to 
that of the control site. However, some other studies 
have shown minimal (van Dolah et al., 1984) or non-
detectable effects of sediment deposition (Smith 
&amp;amp; Rule, 2001). These last authors demonstrated 
that, even in a shallow area (6 m depth), dredge-
spoil dumping at Park Beach (Australia) had no 
detectable short- or medium-term effects upon the 
infaunal community.

The impact of sediment disposal upon 
benthic communities varies depending on factors 
such as volume and sediment characteristics of 
the discharged material, water depth, surface 
and hydrography of the disposal area, types 
of organisms inhabiting the disposal area, and 
similarity of sediments in dredged and disposal 
areas, among others (Windom, 1976).

In this work, pre-disposal sampling at the 
dumpsite area showed the sediment type to be 
primarily silt-clay (81.9%) with lesser percentages 
of sand (18%) and gravel (0.086). During sediment 
disposal, the samples showed increased fractions 
of coarser sediment (Table 1). Baisch et al. (2000), 
after analyzing the sediment characteristics before 
and during dredged material disposal, observed that 
contents of metals, and dissolved organic carbon 
and nitrogen in the disposal site were similar in 
these two periods and remained within the range 
usually detected for that area. 

 During the present study it was registered 
that the current’s flow speed was significant only 
in surface waters (between 0.42 to 0.46 m/s), 
whereas in deeper waters it was greatly reduced  
(&amp;lt;0.05 m/s) (Möller et al., 2000). Thus, it 
is likely that fine dredged-sediment particles 
had already dispersed before hitting the 
seafloor, leaving to be deposited only gravel 
and sand. This fact was reinforced by the 
presence of the typically estuarine gastropod  
H. australis (Bemvenuti, 1997a) during operations 
in the disposal site (D2). In a finding that can be 
related to the ocean surface current, which may 
have changed the deposition route of the shells, 
this species was also found in the control site 
(C2) (Table 2), but not in several samplings from 
coastal region areas near the dumpsite studied 
here (Bemvenuti et al., 1978; Absalão, 1991). On 
the other hand, studies carried out in Patos lagoon 
estuarine region (Bemvenuti, 1997a, b; Bemvenuti 

&amp;amp; Netto, 1998; Rosa-Filho &amp;amp; Bemvenuti, 1998; 
Bemvenuti et al., 1992) registered this species 
as dominant in the sublittoral, among 2 and 6 m 
isobaths, and at depths greater than 6 m in muddy 
sand bottoms in channel areas (&gt; 40,000 ind/m2). 

Another factor relevant to similarity of 
macrobenthic assemblages between the disposal 
and control sites is that biota resident in the study 
area is influenced by the Patos lagoon outlet. 
According to Calliari &amp;amp; Fachin (1993), the area 10-
50 m deep suffers periodic disturbances due to silt 
and clay deposition through Patos lagoon runoff. 
To survive these conditions, resident animals need 
to be mobile and capable of withstanding local 
sedimentation rates (Smith &amp;amp; Rule, 2001).

A number of studies in different types of 
soft-sediment habitat have shown that benthic 
invertebrates can migrate vertically through 
overlying sediment. Maurer et al. (1981a, b; 1982), 
through laboratory experiments with mollusk, 
crustacean, and polychaete species concluded that 
under certain conditions vertical migration can be 
a viable mechanism for recolonizing a dredge-
dumping site.

Such data suggest that the marine 
macrobenthic community under the influence of 
the Patos lagoon has a natural resistance to the 
sediment deposition, developed as a reaction to 
the conditions frequently found at the disposal 
site. For instance, some abundant groups and 
species recorded in this study, like the Oweniidae 
(Myriochele oculata), Paraonidae, and Magelonidae 
(Magelona posterelongata), among others, are 
considered opportunistic or resistant (Harvey  
et al., 1998; Hilbig &amp;amp; Blake, 2000). According to 
Richardson et al., 1977, Magelona sacculata was 
unaffected by dredge material disposal by being an 
active species, capable of considerable migration 
over the sediment surface as well as rapid burrowing 
through the sediment. 

We concluded that the disposal of dredged 
sediment from Patos Lagoon had no detectable 
detrimental effects on macrobenthic faunal 
assemblages in the study area. These results we 
attributed both to the resident biota being adapted 
to dynamic sedimentary conditions, and to the 
dumped estuarine sediment being predominantly 
fine, so that its dispersion in the water column 
might have minimized sediment deposition and 
consequent damage to the benthic fauna.
