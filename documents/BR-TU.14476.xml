ABSTRACT 
This study sought to identify and spatialize the risk of transmission of Manson’s 

schistosomiasis at localities in Pernambuco, Brazil that are used for tourist leisure activities and 

have freshwater environments that are inhabited by the snail that transmits this disease. In order 

to accomplish this, malacological surveys were conducted at the selected localities between 

May and December 2016, in order to identify and georeference the breeding sites and foci of 

schistosomiasis-transmitting mollusks of the genus Biomphalaria. The essential abiotic data for 

mollusk survival were evaluated at each breeding site: temperature, water pH and total 

dissolved solids (TDS). Data relating to breeding site quality were also recorded. The SPSS 20 

software was used to analyze these data, and the chi-square test was applied to investigate 

associations between variables, taking a p-value ? 0.5. Based on geographic coordinates, maps 

representing the distribution of breeding sites and foci, mollusk species found and numbers of 

mollusks sampled in each water body were created. ArcGIS 10.4 software was used to build 
thematic maps using the interpolation technique of inverse distance weighting (IDW). A total 

of 72 localities distributed among 44 municipalities located in the Metropolitan, Zona da Mata 

and Agreste regions of Pernambuco were investigated. At these, 26 reservoirs, 32 breeding sites 

and 10 foci of schistosomiasis intermediate hosts were found. The study identified and located 

problematic localities that are visited by special groups that through exposure to unhealthy 

environments are subject to infection by the parasite S. mansoni. 

Keywords: environment, GIS, monitoring, schistosomiasis.

O presente estudo teve como objetivo identificar e espacializar o risco para transmissão da 

esquistossomose mansoni em localidades pernambucanas com ambientes aquáticos 

dulciaquícolas para a prática do turismo de lazer, onde existe a presença do caramujo 

transmissor da esquistossomose mansoni. Para isso foram realizados inquéritos malacológicos 

entre maio a dezembro de 2016 para identificar e georreferenciar os criadouros/focos de 

moluscos do gênero Biomphalaria, transmissores da esquistossomose. Em cada criadouro 

foram aferidos os dados abióticos essenciais para a sobrevivência dos moluscos: temperatura, 

pH da água e sólidos totais dissolvidos (TDS). Foram também registrados os dados relativos 

à qualidade do criadouro. Para análise desses dados foi utilizado o programa SPSS 20, e foi 

aplicado o teste qui-quadrado para verificar a associação entre as variáveis, considerando p-valor 

?0,5. Com base nas coordenadas geográficas foram criados mapas da distribuição dos criadouros 

e focos, das espécies de moluscos encontrados e do número de moluscos coletados em cada 

coleção hídrica. Foi utilizado o programa ArcGIS 10.4. para construção de mapas temáticos 

usando a técnica de interpolação do Inverso da potência das distâncias (IDW). Foram 

investigadas 72 localidades distribuídas em 44 municípios localizados na Região 

Metropolitana, Zona da Mata e Agreste Pernambucano e nelas foram encontrados 26 

reservatórios, 32 criadouros dos moluscos vetores e 10 focos de transmissão da 

esquistossomose. O presente estudo identificou e localizou com precisão localidades 

problemáticas e frequentadas por grupos especiais que, mediante exposição a ambientes 

insalubres, estão sujeitos à infecção pelo parasita Schistosoma mansoni. 

Palavras-chave: esquistossomose, GIS, meio ambiente, monitoramento. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Ecological tourism attracts nature lovers who choose leisure activities related to nature that 

offer accommodations and additional services. The Travelers’ Health Guidelines studied 

people’s movements and their interactions with various environments, in order to identify the 

risks to which tourists are exposed so that the tourists’ health may be protected during their 

travels. Pre-trip vaccination is among the recommendations for tourists who come to Brazil. 

There are websites that provide information about preventive actions that aim to protect 

travelers and reduce the risk of epidemics (Brasil, 2005). However, movement of people is not 

an activity that is limited to tourism: it also includes migrant or refugee groups. Moreover, it 

must be borne in mind that, for some diseases, there is still no specific vaccination.  

Locally, weekend recreational activities and second-home refuges need to be taken into 

account. The populations involved in such activities live close to natural tourist resources and 

are more exposed to unhealthy environments than are travelers who are just passing through. 

The Travelers’ Health Guidelines need to acknowledge this diversity and healthcare services 

need to expand their differentiated action strategies in order to meet this challenge (Matos e 

Barcellos, 2010). 

The state of Pernambuco presents a mild climate throughout the year and has a large 

network of natural water accumulations consisting of rivers and waterfalls that are attractive for 

water-related leisure activities. In this context, rural and coastal accommodation structures, 

inns, fish-and-pay establishments, resorts and travel agencies offer countless options for 

freshwater sports or leisure activities. Farm owners and urban entrepreneurs have been 

encouraged to diversify their activities through investing in structures for this type of recreation 

without proper attention to basic sanitation infrastructure that would provide health safety for 

freshwater leisure activities. Growth of the tourism industry contributes to the economic and 

social development of the state by attracting visitors. However, landscapes with natural water

resources are becoming modified, and this is leading to serious damage to the environment 

(Agência Nacional de Águas, 2005). 

Manson’s schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease for which the etiological agent is the 

parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Its intermediate hosts are freshwater snails belonging to the 

genus Biomphalaria When parasitized individuals dispose of their feces, which includes the 

parasite’s eggs, in water collection systems inhabited by these snails, these animals become 

infected with the Schistosoma miracidium and start transmitting the disease to other people who 

come into contact with these polluted waters. 

In Pernambuco, schistosomiasis started as an endemic disease in the rural area of the Zona 

da Mata region, and now the foci are spread throughout the coast. It causes high rates of human 

infection, maintenance of acute and severe clinical forms and a significant number of deaths 

(Barbosa et al., 2016). A recent survey indicated 119 localities in Pernambuco where over 15% 

of the population is parasitized and 97.5% of houses do not have sewage collection or treatment. 

This exposes 152,865 people to the risk of infection by S. mansoni (Saucha et al., 2015).  

Poor sanitation conditions at localities that are endemic for schistosomiasis contribute to 

the spread of cases, with severe illness and deaths due to this disease. The relationship between 

the environment and lack of basic sanitation determines occurrences of waterborne diseases. 

Social groups that live in areas that lack sanitation services are subject to potentially greater 

adverse effects to their own health if they pollute freshwater accumulations where disease 

vectors proliferate.  

Sewage discharge into rivers, ponds and peridomestic ditches creates unhealthy 

environments that favor transmission of parasitic diseases. Examples of this include the severe 

schistosomiasis outbreaks that occurred in the metropolitan areas of Belo Horizonte, Minas 

Gerais, Recife, Pernambuco (Barbosa et al., 2011) and Aracaju, Sergipe (de Jesus et al., 2002), 

and in the interior of the state of São Paulo. Recently, in the Chapada Diamantina region 

(Bahia), 32 tourists became infected after swimming in a local pond. Thus, in resorts and parks, 

travelers become susceptible to this parasitic disease when exposed to water contaminated with 

fecal material. 

The term “environmental risk” refers to situations that present a risk relating to what 

surrounds the individual, which may be the natural environment (natural risk) or a man-made 

environment (social and technological risk) resulting from human actions and occupation of 

territory (Dagnino e Carpi, 2007). 

Travelers who are exposed to this environmental risk and who become infected by S. 

mansoni develop the acute form of the disease, if there has been no previous contact between 

the individual and this parasite. However, the acute infection is self-limited and so these 

travelers may return home without presenting typical signs of infection. Timely treatment of 

the disease is thus delayed, which contributes towards its spread into disease-free areas, given 

that travelers move between endemic and non-endemic areas (Barreto et al., 2016).  

This study sought to identify and spatialize the risk of transmission of Manson’s 

schistosomiasis at localities in Pernambuco that are inhabited by the snail that transmits this 

disease and that have freshwater environments used for tourism. 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Localities in municipalities in the Agreste and Zona da Mata regions and in the 

Metropolitan Region of Recife were selected using the Rural Tourism Guidelines of 

Pernambuco and accommodation websites for this state.  

Malacological surveys were conducted at these selected localities between May and 

December 2016 and were made with appropriate tools, like forceps, according to the depth of 

the water collection, following the method developed by Olivier and Schneiderman (1956), in

order to identify and georeference (using the Garmin eTrex® 20 GPS) breeding sites (reservoirs 

with intermediate host snails) of Biomphalaria and foci (breeding sites with infected mollusks) 

of schistosomiasis transmission. Intermediate hosts were sampled and sent to the 

Schistosomiasis Laboratory and Reference Service of Aggeu Magalhães Institute - Fiocruz, in 

order to identify the species and detect infectivity due to S. mansoni, using the traditional light 

exposure technique (Kuntz, 1946) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is sensitive 

and specific for diagnosing low loads of parasitic infection (Melo et al., 2006).  

The essential abiotic data for mollusk survival were evaluated at each breeding site: 

temperature, water pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured in loco with a digital 
spit thermometer, digital pH meter and digital TDS meter, respectively. Data relating to 

breeding site quality were also recorded: natural or artificial water accumulation, presence of 

sewage, presence of vegetation cover, water transparency and the sediment composition. 

Breeding sites were classified as natural (pond, river or waterfall) or artificial (natural pools or 

fish-and-pay ponds). The SPSS 20 software was used to analyze these data, and the chi-square 

test was applied to investigate associations between variables, taking the p-value ? 0.5. 

Based on geographic coordinates, maps representing the distribution of breeding sites and 

foci of transmission, mollusk species found and numbers of mollusks sampled in each water 

accumulation were created. The ArcGIS 10.4 software was used to build thematic maps using 

the interpolation technique of inverse distance weighting (IDW). The IDW interpolator 

determines values for unknown areas by calculating the weighted mean using the inverse of the 

distance between this area and a point where the value is known (Harman et al., 2016). The 

Equation 1 to determine the values of interpolation areas is described by the following formula: 

?0 =
? =1 ?? . ??
?
?

? =1?? ??
                 (1) 

Where: 

 n represents the number of known points;  

Ni is the interpolation value at position i;  

and Pi is the weight of each interpolation value at position i. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A total of 72 localities distributed among 44 municipalities located in the Metropolitan, 

Zona da Mata and Agreste regions of Pernambuco were investigated. At these, 26 reservoirs, 32 

breeding sites of intermediate hosts and 10 foci of schistosomiasis transmission were found. The 

correlation analysis (Pearson and Spearman coefficients) and chi-square and Fisher tests did not 

show any statistically significant differences in presence of schistosomiasis intermediate hosts 

in relation to the variables of each breeding site environment (Table 1). 

Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of breeding sites and species of schistosomiasis 

intermediate hosts at leisure localities. At 36 breeding sites, the species was Biomphalaria 

straminea and at 6 sites it was B. glabrata. The breeding sites for B. straminea at which presence 

of S. mansoni DNA was diagnosed by means of PCR were considered to be potential foci (6 

breeding sites were positive). At 4 breeding sites where B. glabrata was found, snails were found 

to be releasing infecting cercariae. Therefore, these can be considered to be active transmission 

foci for schistosomiasis.

Figure 2 shows the numbers of snails sampled from each breeding site. Two breeding sites 

located at touristic localities on the coast of Pernambuco (Porto de Galinhas and Serrambi) where 

large numbers of the snail B. glabrata infected by S. mansoni were collected are highlighted. 

 
Figure 2. Numbers of specimens sampled from breeding sites of intermediate hosts and foci of 

schistosomiasis transmission identified at water-activity leisure localities in Pernambuco. 

Figure 3 shows that the results regarding the physical-chemical conditions of the water 

accumulations were very similar, both for breeding sites and for reservoirs, thus indicating that 

these reservoirs were susceptible to colonization by schistosomiasis intermediate hosts. 

The data that resulted from the present study made it possible to construct thematic maps 

that indicated schistosomiasis transmission risk areas in touristic water-activity leisure localities 

in Pernambuco that are breeding sites for schistosomiasis-transmitting snails. These breeding 

sites become transmission foci for the disease in the absence of local sanitation systems, which 

leads to fecal pollution of freshwater bodies and favors waterborne diseases, thus threatening the 

health of tourist populations engaged in aquatic recreational activities in Pernambuco. 

The fact that no association regarding specific ecological conditions that favored or 

differentiated breeding sites from reservoirs was found indicated that the aquatic environments 

studied presented the same favorable characteristics and conditions for the intermediate hosts’ 

survival, and that they were able to quickly transform into breeding sites and/or foci. Spatial 

analysis using the IDW estimator was an important epidemiological tool, complementary to the 

statistical analysis of this study. It showed, in map form, that reservoirs, breeding sites of 

intermediate hosts and foci of schistosomiasis transmission, are found under similar physical-

chemical conditions. This facilitates intermediate host colonization and enables the spread of 

disease. The spatial distribution and numbers of mollusks sampled showed the spot intensity of 

the disease and the occurrence of each event. This makes it possible to undertake situational 

analyses in the future, in order to predict the epidemiological and spatial dimensions of the 

disease in the study area.

leisure localities in Pernambuco. 

Among the 8 foci identified, the epidemiological importance of the four foci of the 

intermediate host B. glabrata at which cercariae of S. mansoni were being eliminated needs to 

be highlighted. These represent situations of active transmission of the disease at coastal 

localities such as Itamaracá, Serrambi, Porto de Galinhas and Carne de Vaca, which are 

important resorts in Pernambuco, visited by tourists and local vacationers throughout the year. 

In these coastal areas, there are no natural water accumulations and transmission of 

schistosomiasis is seasonal, governed by the rainy season (May to August). During this period,

peripheral foci overflow and infected snails are carried into the streets. These artificial and 

peridomestic foci are formed by wastewater that is discharged into the environment, in 

communities that dwell in areas surrounding the resorts (Barbosa et al., 2015a; 2015b). 

When tourists disembark in Recife, they receive an information leaflet on “Rural Routes in 

Pernambuco”, which indicates localities with freshwater leisure attractions that are located in 

areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis. Considering that these localities receive visitors 

throughout the year, information needs to be provided for them regarding the risks that they may 

be exposed to when visiting water bodies at localities with foci of schistosomiasis transmission, 

and the risk that they run of becoming agents that disseminate parasitic diseases into non-

endemic areas. Travelers’ health precautions should be based on a set of actions and partnerships 

between governments, travel agencies and health surveillance sectors, in order to provide proper 

and precise information about the risks present in aquatic leisure environments, with the aim of 

protecting people who visit these areas.  

Some of the problems relating to ecotourism are far from being resolved, such as insistence 

that tourism entrepreneurs should follow the technical norms issued by the Brazilian Association 

of Ecotourism and Adventure Tourism Agencies (ABETA) and sanctions for those that do not 

conform. This Association has been active throughout Brazil since 2004 and is responsible for 

management and implementation of the Safe Adventure Program, in partnership with the 

National Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas (SEBRAE), the Ministry 

for Tourism, and the main Brazilian ecotourism and adventure tourism agencies (Abeta e 

Ministério do Turismo, 2009). 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

Although the present study was only descriptive, it precisely identified and located 

problematic localities that are visited by tourist groups that, through exposure to unhealthy 

environments, are subject to infection by the parasite S. mansoni. Expansion of this knowledge 

is necessary in order to evaluate the environmental characteristics responsible for maintenance 

of these foci of the disease transmission, and thus to produce more significant conclusions that 

might become effective public healthcare strategies that minimize the impact of transmission of 

this disease among local populations and tourists who come to this state seeking leisure in its 

beautiful landscapes.
