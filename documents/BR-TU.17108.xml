Keywords: Petrological cooling rates; Fe-Mg diffusion; Ribeira Fold Belt. 

Abstract: The São Fidelis – Santo António de Pádua sector of central Ribeira Fold Belt is mainly composed of migmatites, granulites and
blastomylonites. Application of two contrasting methodologies to obtain petrological cooling rates based on Fe-Mg diffusion between garnet and
respective biotite inclusions proved unfruitful. This was mainly due to: a) high dispersion of results caused by open-system behaviour; and b) narrow
closure temperature variation caused by garnet reequilibration at high temperatures followed by very fast cooling. The obtained results are mainly
qualitative but in broad agreement with previously obtained thermochronological results based on integration of multiple isotopic systems.

Resumo: O sector São Fidelis – Santo António de Pádua, pertencente à zona central da Faixa Ribeira, é fundamentalmente composto por migmati-
tos, granulitos e blastomilonitos. A aplicação de diferentes metodologias com o objectivo de obter taxas de arrefecimento baseadas na difusão Fe-Mg entre
granada e respectivas inclusões de biotite revelou-se infrutífera. Tal deve-se fundamentalmente a: a) elevada dispersão dos resultados causada pela existência
de um sistema aberto; b) estreita variação das temperaturas de fecho do sistema causada por re-homogeneização da granada a altas temperaturas seguida de
arrefecimento muito rápido. Os resultados obtidos são fundamentalmente qualitativos, mas estão de acordo com resultados termocronológicos previamente
obtidos baseados na integração de múltiplos sistemas isotópicos.

1. INTRODUCTION

Previous works in central Ribeira Fold Belt (RFB)
established age constraints for the Brasiliano orogeny
and tectonic evolution of the belt (e.g.: CORDANI et al.,
1973; MACHADO et al., 1996; SCHMITT et al., 2004;
2008; HEILBRON &amp;amp; MACHADO, 2003; BENTO DOS
SANTOS et al., 2007; FONSECA et al., 2008). However,
there are few thermochronological studies (BENTO DOS
SANTOS et al., 2008; FONSECA et al., 2008; SCHMITT et
al., 2004) that accurately depict the geodynamic evolu-
tion and quantitatively constrain the cooling rates of
central RFB. 

This work provides new petrological cooling rates,
which can be determined from analysis of diffusional

zoning in metamorphic minerals (SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH,
1996). Here, petrological cooling rates based on Fe-Mg
diffusion between garnet and biotite inclusions for the
studied granulites and migmatites are presented. The
obtained results are then compared with geochronologi-
cal cooling rates previously obtained in the study area
(BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2008). 

Several authors tried to use mineral diffusion mecha-
nisms in order to determine cooling rates (e.g.: DODSON,
1973; LASAGA et al., 1977; EHLERS et al., 1994; SPEAR
&amp;amp; PARRISH, 1996). These authors assumed that diffusion
induced by compositional variation in the garnet-biotite
interface is a function of Kd(Mg/Fe)

Garnet-Biotite in
response to thermal changes, such as cooling during the
retrograde path. During cooling garnet is enriched in

Fe/(Fe+Mg), whereas biotite inclusions become poorer.
When temperature drops below closure temperature,
diffusion becomes negligible. The diffusive process is
limited by the rate of diffusion in garnet, because
DFe/Mg

Biotite &gt;&gt; DFe/Mg
Garnet and mass balance deter-

mines that diffusive flows (rate of cation transfer in the
mineral interface) between garnet and biotite must be the
same. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a func-
tion of biotite inclusion size or garnet/biotite proportion.
This implies that Fe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite
inclusions can be transformed in its respective apparent
closure temperature and cooling rates can be obtained
(Fig. 1). The used methodologies only consider diffusion
between garnet and respective biotite inclusions and
exclude garnet – matrix biotite interface diffusive proces-

ses, because it is very likely that the latter had open-system
behaviour. Besides, most matrix biotite is affected or was
formed by net-transfer reactions that include consump-
tion of garnet rims. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use
garnet and matrix biotites to model cation diffusion
based petrological cooling rates. 

This work explores the referred assumptions that
allow petrological cooling rates to be applied to natural
systems, as well as the potential pitfalls regarding these
methodologies, namely the difficulty in assuring that
open-system behaviour did not take place in complex
orogenic belts, such as the RFB. Therefore, this article is
a critic work to the applied methodologies and also a first
attempt to constrain petrological cooling rates in the
RFB.

in petrological cooling rates using the SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH (1996) methodology. Garnet’s core composition is used with the FERRY &amp;amp; SPEAR (1978)
thermometer in order to obtain apparent closure temperatures. CHAKRABORTY &amp;amp; GANGULLY (1992) – C&amp;amp;G (1992) – diffusion coefficients are used
to depict the petrological cooling rates. In this example, cooling rates range from 1 – 1000ºC/Ma (modified from SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH, 1996).

2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND FIELD
OBSERVATIONS 

The RFB extends over 1,500 km along the SE
Brazilian coast from southern Bahia State to Uruguay,
through Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais,
São Paulo and Paraná States (CORDANI, 1971). The RFB
is a NE-SW trending (south and central sectors) and
NNE-SSW trending (northern sector) Neoproterozoic
mobile belt (CORDANI et al., 1973) formed during the
Brasiliano Orogeny as outcome of the collision between
the São Francisco and West Congo cratons, from which
resulted Western Gondwana at around 670 – 480 Ma ago
(TROUW et. al., 2000; SCHMITT et al., 2008) (Fig. 2a). 

The RFB constitutes a very complex orogenic zone
composed of several geological units, commonly sepa-
rated by deep dextral shears, being the studied São
Fidelis – Santo António de Pádua (SFSAP) sector located
inside the Além Paraíba – Santo António de Pádua Shear
(APPS) system (Fig. 2b). This megashear system
deformed the area rocks imposing a NE trending trans-
pressive shear deformation (FONSECA et al., 2008) asso-
ciated with long-term HT/LP metamorphism (BENTO
DOS SANTOS et al., 2008). 

According to TROUW et al. (2000), the RFB can be
divided in four major lithologic associations: a) reworked
Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement rocks composed
of metavolcanic-sedimentary sequences, granodioritic
orthogneisses and intermediate granulites; b) a deformed
meta-sedimentary sequence composed of pelitic schists
and high grade migmatitic paragneisses with quartzite,
calc-silicate and amphibolite intercalations; c) molasic
sedimentary basins; and d) widespread granitoid intru-
sive bodies with different tectonic settings, from pre- to
post-collision stages of the Brasiliano orogenic system
(CAMPOS NETO &amp;amp; FIGUEIREDO, 1995; TROUW et. al.,
2000; PEDROSA SOARES &amp;amp; WIEDMANN-LEONARDOS,
2000). 

HEILBRON &amp;amp; MACHADO (2003) and VALLADARES et
al. (2008) divided the central RFB into four tecto-
nic/lithologic/geochronological domains as klippen
thrusted against the São Francisco Craton. According to
these authors, the central sector of RFB includes from
NW to SE: a) the Occidental Domain, a pre-1.8 Ga
passive margin succession, considered to be the reworked
margin of the São Francisco Craton (basement rocks);
b) the Paraíba do Sul klippe, composed of amphibolite
facies orthogneisses and meta-sediments; c) the Oriental

Domain, comprising the Rio Negro Magmatic arc
(TUPINAMBÁ, 1999) and fore-arc and back-arc meta-
-sedimentary sequences; and d) the Cabo Frio Terrane
(SCHMITT et al., 2008), an allochthonous terrane belon-
ging to the West Congo Craton. 

Regarding the RFB tectonic evolution, a dominant
ensialic evolution with important crustal reworking has
been favoured (CORDANI et al., 1973), although subordi-
nated oceanic crust subduction (and obduction) and con-
tinental accretion have also been considered (PEDROSA
SOARES &amp;amp; WIEDMANN-LEONARDOS, 2000; PEDROSA
SOARES et al., 2001). Within the central part of the belt,
in the Rio de Janeiro state, HEILBRON et al. (1993) and
MACHADO et al. (1996) proposed that the tectonometa-
morphic evolution of the Brasiliano Orogeny should be
divided in: a) collision period (590 – 563 Ma) in which
occurred the main deformation phases and meta-
morphism, with reworking and partial melting of older
continental basement rocks and emplacement of several
granitoid bodies; b) post-collision period at 535 – 520 Ma,
corresponding to major dextral shear zones and retro-
grade metamorphism; c) post-tectonic period of orogenic
collapse with emplacement of late granitic plutons at 490
Ma ago (BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007). 

The studied area, the SFSAP sector, is located in the
central-north part of the RFB in northern Rio de Janeiro
State (SE Brazil) and SE to the APPS main shear (near
Santo António de Pádua) (Fig. 2 and 3). The SFSAP
sector underwent complex polyphase ductile deforma-
tion, with thrusting dominantly to ESE, followed by
NNE-SSW sub-horizontal dextral shearing that produced
the elongated mineral fabric observed in the studied
rocks (BASCOU et al., 2002; FONSECA et al., 2008). In the
studied area three main deformation phases can be
observed. As outlined by FONSECA et al. (2008), the
earliest deformation event (D1) corresponds to high
temperature (ductile) thrusts (250°, 55-70° NW), that
were mostly erased by the main syn- to post-metamor-
phic peak D2 event. This corresponds to the dextral
megashear APPS system (50-65°, 70-85° NW). Finally, a
D3 fragile/brittle event is simultaneous with reactivation
of D2 conjugated fault systems (290-320°, subvertical). 

Intense granulite facies metamorphism produced
generalized migmatization and granitoid production by
partial melting of paragneisses. Outcrops in the area
comprise the referred migmatites, granulites and blasto-
mylonites that resulted from late retrogression of the
other rock types. Migmatites (Fig. 4a-b) show a clear

separation of gneissic paleosome and aplitic or pegma-
titic neosome (Migmatite terminology as recommended
by WIMMENAUER &amp;amp; BRYHNI, 2007). These rocks present
gneissic foliation and banding, as well as clear evidences
of late deformation and retrogression. These are associa-
ted with large elongated or rounded, undeformed and
homogeneous granitic to migmatitic batholiths (diatexi-
tes), that represent a more advanced stage of anatexis of
the migmatites. Marbles are occasionally interlayered in
the migmatites as decametric to kilometric thick bands or
small metric pockets. In the study area, granulites range
from charnockites (s. s.) (Fig. 4c) to enderbites (basic
granulites) that crop out as elongated NE-SW trending
massifs and are overthrusted onto the migmatites during
D2 and D3 deformation phases (FONSECA et al., 2008). 

Blastomylonites resulted from the deformation and
retrogression of the other rock types in areas closer to the
APPS main shears (Fig. 4d). They represent the
deformed and retrogressed equivalents of the granulites
(mainly) and of the migmatites. 

3. PETROGRAPHY

Petrographic observations and a mineral chemistry
synthesis for the studied rocks are provided in this
section with the exception of garnet and biotite mineral
chemistry that will be provided with more detail below. 

3.1. Migmatites

Paleosome commonly comprises a g + bi + q + pl
(Xan = 0.26 – 0.43; Xor = 0.01 – 0.04) + ksp (Xab &amp;lt;0.1;
Xan &amp;lt;0.01) ± mt ± sill ± ilm (Mineral abbreviations
according to POWELL &amp;amp; HOLLAND, 1999) gneissic asso-
ciation, whereas the neosomatic fraction consists of a
g + bi + pl (Xan = 0.27 – 0.42; Xor = 0.01 – 0.04) + q + ksp
(Xab &amp;lt;0.1; Xan &amp;lt;0.01) ± sill ± ap mineral association
(Fig. 5a). Migmatites do not show significant composi-
tional difference between paleosome and neosome,
including for garnets and biotites (see below). The

granolepidoblastic texture present in both paleosome and
neosome, largely defined by the biotite + quartz associa-
tion, is commonly obliterated by coarse grained, some-
times centimetric, subhedral or rounded poikiloblastic
garnet, plagioclase and K-feldspar granoblasts. They fre-
quently have matrix mineral inclusions, such as biotite,
quartz and magnetite. These megablasts are usually
deformed, bent or cracked and show recrystallized rims.
The garnet – plagioclase – K-feldspar granoblastic
assemblage represents the metamorphic peak paragenesis
of the migmatites, possibly with small amounts of quartz
and residual biotite. 

The presence of biotite and sillimanite at garnet rims
is a clear evidence of retrogression by garnet consump-
tion. Symplectitic biotite + quartz + sillimanite growth
after garnet is a common feature of these rocks. In some
cases, these migmatites are intensively sheared, origina-
ting a fine grained mylonitic banding with abundant silli-
manite (Fig. 5b). 

3.2. Granulites 

Isotropic charnockites (s. s.) show a medium to coarse
sized granoblastic texture with megablastic (sometimes
centimetric) subhedral g + pl (Xan = 0.29 – 0.51; Xor =
= 0 – 0.03) + ksp (Xab &amp;lt;0.1 and Xan &amp;lt;0.01) + opx
(Xen = 0.39 – 0.48; Xwo &amp;lt;0.03) assemblage. Bi + q + mt
+ ilm + ap + zrc are only present as diffuse, rarely orien-
tated, matrix minerals (Fig. 5c). Biotites are frequently
included in garnet and rarely in orthopyroxene mega-
blasts. Bi + q symplectites are common around garnet
and pyroxene rims, revealing that the retrometamorphic
path involved significant deformation with decompres-
sion. 

Some granulites are extensively sheared and retro-
gressed, showing a fine grained mylonitic or cataclastic
texture with g + bi + pl + q + ksp + opx (relic) ± ap ± hb
(XMg = 0.35 – 0.65) mineral assemblage (Fig. 5d).
Metamorphic peak minerals (pl + ksp + q + opx + g) are
intensively deformed, fractured, grinded and replaced by
an amphibolite facies assemblage of bi + hb. 

Enderbites are banded, medium to coarse grained
and have a subhedral g + pl (Xan = 0.29 – 0.51; Xor =
= 0 – 0.03) + opx (Xen = 0.41 – 0.44; Xwo &amp;lt;0.02) + cpx
(Xen = 0.30 – 0.35; Xwo = 0.42 – 0.48) metamorphic peak
paragenesis. This assemblage is often replaced by the hb
(XMg = 0.35 – 0.65) + pl (Xan = 0.29 – 42; Xor = 0 – 0.03)
± bi amphibolite facies assemblage (Fig. 5e). 

3.3. Blastomylonites 

Migmatites and granulites are profusely deformed
and retrogressed in the near region of Santo António de
Pádua, centre of the APPS system. There, it is very diffi-
cult to determine if the observed rocks were granulites or
migmatites because of the blastomylonitic transforma-
tion they experienced. Therefore, the broad term blasto-
mylonite is employed. 

Petrographic features indicate that they are equivalent
to their undeformed counterparts, with the exception of
having a profuse equigranular mylonitic texture and
finely recrystallized mineral grains (Fig. 5f). Mineralo-
gical replacement of metamorphic peak assemblage
progresses in the same way as previously stated for
migmatites and granulites, but in blastomylonites there
are only remnants of the high grade paragenesis. There-
fore, the typical mineral assemblage of blastomylonites
is pl (Xan = 0.17 – 0.55; Xor = 0.01 – 0.02) + bi + q + ksp
(Xab &amp;lt;0.22; Xan &amp;lt;0.01) with some small relics of the
high temperature minerals, such as garnet, orthopyro-
xene (Xen = 0.41 – 0.44; Xwo &amp;lt;0.02) or clinopyroxene
(Xen = 0.30 – 0.35; Xwo = 0.42 – 0.48). 

4. GARNET AND BIOTITE MINERAL
CHEMISTRY

Samples were prepared for the different types of
analyses at the Instituto de Geociências da Universidade
de São Paulo (IGc-USP) and at the Departamento de
Geologia da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de
Lisboa (DG-FCUL). 

Mineral composition data were determined on carbon
coated polished thin sections using a JEOL JXA 733
wavelength dispersive Electron Microprobe, at the
Centro de Geologia da Faculdade de Ciências da
Universidade de Lisboa (CeGUL). Minerals were
analysed with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a
current of 25 nA, using a beam of 5 µm. Both natural and
synthetic silicates were used as standards. Errors are
typically below 1.5 wt% for major elements. 

An extensive mineral chemistry study on garnets,
biotite inclusions in garnets and matrix biotites was
performed in the studied rocks, namely major element
analyses of rim – core – rim (RCR) profiles in garnets
and garnet – biotite interface (GBI) profiles in garnets.
These results were obtained in granulites and in the paleo-
somes (mainly) of migmatites. However, no significant

compositional variation was found for paleosomes and
neosomes of the migmatite samples. 

The following mineral chemistry data on garnets and
biotites is summarized due to the extensive number of
chemical analyses performed in both garnet and biotite
(over 2500 and over 1800 analyses, respectively).
Examples of RCR profiles of the studied garnets are
provided in Fig. 6 as a synthesis. GBI profiles in garnets

and summarized analyses of biotite inclusions are
provided in the petrological cooling rates section. 

Mineral chemistry results for blastomylonites are
presented as a synthesis in order to be compared with
their undeformed equivalents. However, due to the
extensive shearing and metamorphic recrystallization
that characterize these rocks, no attempt to obtain petro-
logical cooling rates in blastomylonites was performed.

4.1. Garnets 

Garnets are almandine-rich in all rock types, with
Xalm always higher than 0.54 and always with Mg-richer
cores compared to the rims. All rock types show the same
zoning pattern from core (Mg-richer) to rim (Fe-richer),
but display very different range of values, namely Xalm =
0.61 to 0.75 and Xpy = 0.07 to 0.21 for granulites, Xalm
= 0.54 to 0.77 and Xpy = 0.07 to 0.37 for migmatites and
Xalm = 0.59 to 0.77 and Xpy = 0.11 to 0.19 for blastomy-
lonites. Migmatites do not show significant composi-
tional difference between paleosome and neosome. They
present the highest pyrope contents and variable grossu-
lar contents ranging from Xgr = 0.01 to 0.27. Although
the highest value of Xgr is present in a migmatite, granu-
lites are normally richer in calcium, with Xgr ranging
from 0.02 to 0.22. Spessartine contents are always low
(normally Xspss &amp;lt;0.1), reaching a maximum of 0.13 in
granulites and migmatites. Examples of compositional
RCR profiles of garnets from both rock types are
provided in Fig. 6a-d. 

4.2. Biotites 

Granulites have matrix biotites with XMg ranging
from 0.39 to 0.55 and high TiO2 contents ranging from
3.8 to 6.3 wt%. Migmatites show a great range of XMg
contents ranging from 0.36 to Fe-poor matrix biotites
with XMg = 0.76, whereas TiO2 contents range between
3.7 to 4.5 wt%. This XMg range is observable in both
paleosome and neosome. Blastomylonites show XMg
values similar to granulites (0.39 to 0.55) and TiO2
contents ranging from 4.9 – 5.8 wt%. Fe/Mg composition
and size of biotite inclusions in garnet from migmatites
and granulites are synthesized in Tables 1a-f and will be
further discussed below. 

5. PETROLOGICAL COOLING RATES 

As previously referred, diffusion induced by compo-
sitional variation in the garnet-biotite interface is a func-
tion of Kd(Mg/Fe)Garnet-Biotite in response to thermal
changes, such as cooling during retrograde path.
Fe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite inclusions can
thus be transformed in its respective closure temperature
(Tc) and converted in terms of thermochronological
evolution by obtaining cooling rates. 

This work uses two significantly different metho-
dologies that relies on Fe-Mg exchange between garnet
and biotite inclusions: a) the method proposed by SPEAR
&amp;amp; PARRISH (1996), based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling
between a garnet megablast and its corresponding biotite
inclusions; b) the method proposed by GANGULLY et al.
(1998) that uses garnet compositional profiles near the
garnet/biotite inclusion interface in order to infer meta-
morphic cooling rates. These methods are relatively
recent but have been applied successfully in other
orogenic belts (e.g.: SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH, 1996; MUNHÁ et
al., 2005; STORM &amp;amp; SPEAR, 2005). 

5.1. The SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH (1996) method

This method is based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling
between a garnet megablast and its corresponding biotite
inclusions. Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a function of
biotite inclusions size if diffusion is exclusive between
garnet and the several biotites included. This will
produce larger compositional variations in smaller biotite
inclusions. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg) in each inclusion can
be transformed in its respective apparent closure temper-
ature using the garnet’s core composition and the FERRY
&amp;amp; SPEAR (1978) thermometer (Tab. 1a-f). Cooling rates
are obtained using the diffusion coefficients of
CHAKRABORTY &amp;amp; GANGULLY (1992), as shown in Fig. 7
and 8. 

Fig. 7 shows that some Fe/Mg results are indeed
correlated with biotite inclusions size, providing trends
for some migmatites and granulites, whereas others
provide significant dispersion and no correlation.
However, samples that provide correlation trends
between Fe/Mg results and biotite inclusions size are
not significantly different in Fe/Mg contents, having
Fe/Mg variation &amp;lt;0.2, in most cases (Table 1a-f). This
is problematic, since small amplitudes in Fe/Mg of
biotite inclusions provide a very narrow variation for
apparent closure temperatures, as can be seen in Table 1
and Fig. 8. 

The several petrological cooling rates plots, summa-
rized in Fig. 8, allow us to state that samples that show
high Fe/Mg dispersion, also show significant closure
temperature dispersion (Fig. 8 a-c) with cooling rates
spanning from 0.1 to 200°C/Ma, whereas samples that
show very narrow Fe/Mg variation provide flat closure
temperature patterns (Fig. 8 d-f) with cooling rates span-
ning from 1 to 200°C/Ma.

Fig. 6  – Examples of compositional RCR profiles in garnets from migmatites (Fig. 6a-b) and granulites (Fig. 6c-d). Xalm is always plotted in the main
axis (at the left), whereas Xspss, Xpy and Xgr are plotted in the secondary axis (at the right). Fig. 6a shows a typical zoning pattern for garnet
(as described in the text), increasing substantially the Fe/(Fe+Mg) values in the core area due to the proximity of a biotite inclusion; Fig. 6b
shows a rare RCR profile where garnet does not present the expect results, which is probably due to garnet consumption or some other
heterogeneity; Fig. 6c shows a typical diffusive RCR profile for garnet with a zoning pattern where Fe and Mn decreases and Mg increases
from rim to core; Fig. 6d shows the same zoning pattern, but only in one rim.

5.2. The GANGULLY et al. (1998) method 

Another attempt to obtain petrologic cooling rates
with compositional Fe-Mg diffusion between garnet and
biotite was performed by using the GANGULLY et al.

(1998) method. It consists in modelling the variation of
garnet’s composition in the interface with a biotite inclu-
sion, from the biotite/garnet interface to an area of the
garnet that is far enough from the compositional effect
caused by the biotite inclusion, i.e. the plateau composi-

in the same order as in Fig. 7. Some samples show a great dispersion of results, making it impossible to accurately depict any trend for
cooling rates (Fig. 8a-c), whereas others show a very narrow closure temperature variation (Fig. 8d-f), suggesting homogenized Fe/Mg
values. Apparent closure temperatures vs. biotite dimensions are plotted with the CHAKRABORTY &amp;amp; GANGULLY (1992) diffusion coefficients.

tion of garnet. This method is significantly opposed to
the previous one because it does not use the compositio-
nal variation of biotite inclusions, but the compositional
variation of garnet around the biotite inclusion. For this
second method we used the software “GARBIDIF”
developed by MUNHÁ (personal communication) and
the garnet Fe-Mg diffusion parameters of GANGULLY et
al. (1998). 

A GBI compositional profile was obtained for granu-
lite 153c and migmatite 73A (Tab. 2 a-b; Fig. 9-10)
around the respective biotite inclusions. However, the
granulite garnet shows no Fe/(Fe/Mg) zoning in the inter-
face with the biotite inclusion, even with a minimum

distance of analyse to the garnet – biotite interface being
5 µm (Fig. 9). Migmatite 73A GBI profile shows 220 µm
size Fe/(Fe/Mg) zoning in the interface with the biotite
inclusion (Fig. 10). This will be discussed in the following
section. 

6. DISCUSSION

The results obtained with the SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH
(1996) method are very difficult to interpret both for
granulites and migmatites, because biotite dimension

temperatures show very high dispersion of results. It is,
therefore, impossible to discriminate a cooling rates
trend (Fig. 8). Other samples (Fig. 8 d-f) show a very low
range of apparent closure temperatures for biotites that
are very different in terms of size. This suggests that
garnet and its biotite inclusions must have been reequili-
brated (re-homogenized) at high temperatures and then
cooled very fast, inhibiting significant change in the
Fe/Mg of biotite inclusions, and consequently, in the
apparent temperatures. In both cases, important assump-
tions for the application of this method were not main-
tained: cationic exchange with mass balance preservation
between garnet and biotite inclusions (i.e. close system
behaviour) and/or sufficiently discriminating Fe/Mg
variation in biotite inclusions correlated with respective
size. Therefore, although this methodology provided
some insights regarding the general trends for cooling
patterns, it did not constrain accurately the cooling rates
of the studied rocks. 

The obtained compositional profiles using the
GANGULLY et al. (1998) method also provided unsatis-
factory results, since granulite 153c shows no type of
Fe/(Fe/Mg) garnet zoning in the interface with the biotite
inclusion (Fig. 9). This implies that garnet was equili-
brated with a significant amount of biotite at high
temperatures, followed by very fast cooling that did not
allow the formation of any type of zoning pattern (mini-
mum distance of the analyses to the garnet – biotite inter-
face is 5 µm). This hampers any type of inference regar-

ding petrological cooling rates. However, it is possible to
conclude (qualitatively) that it must have been high
temperature maintenance for a substantial amount of
time (that allowed for the garnet to be homogenized),
followed by a period of very fast cooling rates, as
evidenced in samples 36Cb-1, 341a and 222-2 (Fig. 8 d-f).
This is in overall agreement with geochronological
cooling rates provided by BENTO DOS SANTOS et al.
(2008) (see below). 

Migmatite 73A garnet compositional profile (Fig. 10)
in the interface with the biotite inclusion is significantly
opposed to the previous one, because it presents a
pronounced zoning pattern from Fe/(Fe+Mg) higher
values close to the biotite to more Mg-rich values far
from the interface with the biotite inclusion. 

The profile is divided in three parts (as evidenced in
Fig. 10): zone 1 (far from the biotite inclusion) shows
plateau values (Fe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.623 – 0.629; average
Fe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.6261), equivalent with the garnet’s core
composition far from the inclusions (compare with Fig. 11
that shows the RCR profile for the referred garnet; ave-
rage core Fe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.628). This area of the profile
is absent of Fe-Mg cation exchange between the garnet
and the inclusion, i.e. there is preservation of garnet’s
initial composition; zone 2 shows an apparent arithmetic
increase of Fe/(Fe + Mg) values according with proxi-
mity to the biotite inclusion; and, finally, zone 3 shows
an exponential Fe/(Fe + Mg) increase with proximity to
the biotite inclusion. 

Fig. 10 – Zoned GBI compositional profile of the studied garnet in migmatite 73A, as explained in the text.



Assumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet – biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 97

Modelling for this compositional profile is based on
the assumption that Fe-Mg cationic exchange between
garnet and corresponding biotite inclusion is exclusive
and that mass balance preservation between both mine-
rals occurred. Therefore, the effective dimensions of
each mineral were used (garnet radius (RGarnet) is 1 mm
and the average biotite dimension (RBiotite) is 0.1 mm) at
different cooling rates. The other diffusive parameters
used were DFe/Mg

Biotite = 100DFe/Mg
Garnet; Initial

Temperature (Ti) = 800°C and Initial Pressure (Pi) = 8 kbar
(BENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008; MUNHÁ et al., 2008);
Fe/(Fe+Mg)i

Garnet = 0.6261). 
After performing several modelling with different

cooling rates from 5 to 200°C/Ma (Fig. 12), it became
evident that it was impossible to adequately adjust any
cooling rate pattern to the obtained compositional
profile, especially in zone 2. The mentioned modelling,
besides not adjusting adequately to the profile, appa-
rently would imply the possibility of having cooling rates
so disparate as 5 and 200°C/Ma (Fig. 12). 

The fact that none of the obtained modelling is adjus-
table to the GBI profile and because zone 2 presents
arithmetic increase, suggests the existence of non-exclu-
sivity of diffusive processes between garnet and biotite
inclusion. Hardly, such a small inclusion of biotite (0.1 mm
radius) could cause such a significant increase in
Fe/(Fe+Mg) in a part of the garnet so far away from the

interface (220 µm), even with very low cooling rates.
Therefore, it is suggested that garnet may have not
maintained equilibrium exclusively with the referred
biotite inclusion during an early period of its cooling.
This must have been caused by retrograde reaction
processes (SPEAR &amp;amp; FLORENCE, 1992; KOHN &amp;amp; SPEAR,
2000) with a large amount of biotite, such as matrix
biotite. Modelling performed with similar amounts of
garnet and biotite (RGarnet = 1mm; RBiotite = 1mm;
DFe/Mg

Biotite = 100DFe/Mg
Garnet; Ti = 800°C; Pi = 8 kbar;

Fe/(Fe+Mg)i
Garnet = 0.6261) at different cooling rates

(Fig. 13) show very reasonable adjustment to zones 1 and
2, suggesting initial very high cooling rates (50 to
200°C/Ma), but a pronounced difference to the composi-
tional profile in zone 3. 

Thus, migmatite 73A must have had a very complex
cooling pattern during which remained in equilibrium
with a biotite reservoir such as available matrix biotite
(in an early period when biotite was very abundant or
when garnet had smaller dimensions than presently) at
high cooling rates. This was probably followed by a
period when garnet must have been in exclusive equili-
brium with its biotite inclusion at lower temperatures.
However, the aforementioned cooling pattern, inferred
by combining the two modelling with different gar-
net/biotite volume proportions, cannot simply be put
together to infer a coherent cooling pattern, because the

Fig. 11 – RCR compositional profile of the studied garnet in migmatite 73A. Xalm and Xpy are plotted in the main axis (at the left), whereas Xspss and
Xgr are plotted in the secondary axis (at the right). This garnet does not show a typical RCR zoning pattern, because the left rim shows plateau
values, probably due to retrograde consumption of garnet.

kinetics of garnet-biotite diffusion of each step is non-
reproducible. This was confirmed when several model-
ling were performed by combining a first non-diffusive
(open-system behaviour) followed by a purely diffusive
(closed-system behaviour) Fe-Mg exchange between
garnet and biotite. No modelling provided reasonable
results compatible with the obtained garnet composi-
tional profile near the biotite inclusion. 

It can be concluded, after the use of two significantly
different methodologies to obtain petrological cooling
rates, that there was not exclusivity of mass balanced
diffusive processes between the studied garnets and
respective biotite inclusions. The system was opened to
reaction processes with the rock’s matrix, which
increases the difficulty of using these methodologies.
Therefore, the existence of non-diffusive processes in

Fig. 12 – Zoned compositional profile of garnet from migmatite 73A (as in Fig. 10) plotted with the different modelling results at different cooling
rates, based on the assumption that garnet – biotite inclusion cationic diffusion is exclusive. As can be seen, the GBI profile is only adequate
in zone 3, near the biotite inclusion, implying the possibility of having cooling rates as different as 5 and 200ºC/Ma.

rates, based on the assumption that garnet was in equilibrium with reasonable amounts of matrix biotite. As can be seen, the GBI profile is
only adequate to zones 1 and 2 (far from the biotite inclusion) implying very high cooling rates from 50 to 200ºC/Ma.



Assumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet – biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 99

garnet, as well as the possibility of plastic deformation of
garnet at high temperatures (STOREY &amp;amp; PRIOR, 2005),
such as those estimated for peak metamorphic conditions
in central RFB (T = 800 – 900°C; BENTO DOS SANTOS,
2008; MUNHÁ et al., 2008), makes it very hard to apply
this methodologies, since deformation at high tempera-
tures reduces the effective dimension of garnet and
allows the interaction between garnet’s core and matrix
biotite. Probably, this is also the cause for the high
dispersion of results in some samples used for the
SPEAR &amp;amp; PARRISH (1996) method. 

BENTO DOS SANTOS et al. (2008) provided ther-
mochronological constraints for the SFSAP sector based
on integration of multiple isotopic systems and
concluded that migmatites were cooled at relatively
stable 3 – 5°C/Ma, whereas granulites were maintained
at lower crustal levels and very slowly cooled (&amp;lt;2°C/Ma)
during long-term sub-horizontal transpressive shearing
(FONSECA et al., 2008). This period of slow-cooling
endured until orogenic collapse occurred, leading to
abrupt fast cooling of granulites (8 to 30°C/Ma) in the
last stages of Brasiliano Orogeny. The present petrologi-
cal cooling rates are very difficult to interpret and to
quantify, but provide qualitative results in agreement
with BENTO DOS SANTOS et al. (2008) conclusions, such
as the idea of having high temperature maintenance that
reequilibrated the garnets, followed by very fast cooling
that did not allow significant Fe/Mg diffusion between
garnet and biotite inclusions. 

Intense deformation caused by the long-term sub-
-horizontal transpressive shearing (FONSECA et al., 2008)
can be seen in sheared migmatites and granulites (as
described in the Petrography section of this work), as
well as in the fact that some are abundantly blastomy-
lonitized. This is the probable cause for the open-system
behaviour found in some samples. It may have altered
biotite diffusion mechanisms and reequilibrated garnet
with minerals or fluids outside the garnet – biotite inclu-
sion system, adding complexities and increasing the
uncertainties regarding the use of these methodologies.

7. CONCLUSIONS 

The several obtained petrological cooling rates with
two significantly different methodologies are very dubious
and provide mainly qualitative results due to the
complex evolution of the belt that allowed open-system
behaviour. This altered biotite diffusion mechanisms or

reequilibrated garnet with minerals or fluids outside the
garnet – biotite inclusion system. Nevertheless, the
presented results, although very difficult to interpret and
to quantify, provide qualitative results that are in broad
agreement with previously obtained geochronological
cooling rates. Thermochronology based on integration of
multiple isotopic systems are thus more accurate for
inferring cooling rates in rocks that endured complex
cooling patterns, significant deformation and Fe-Mg
open-system behaviour.
