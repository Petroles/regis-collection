resumo 

 

 

Durante a sinterização de sistemas policristalinos ocorrem processos às 

partículas do material entre os quais densificação, engrossamento do grão, 

controlo da porosidade, segregação das partículas entre outros. Estes 

processos resultam num de três transportes de mecanismos 

condensação/evaporação na superfície, pela difusão nos limites do grão e 

pela difusão da látice. A microestrutura final pode ser modificada ao forçar 

um específico fenómeno a ser predominante sobre os restantes durante o 

processo de sinterização. 

Por exemplo, o processo de sinterização por aquecimento rápido representa 

um procedimento onde o perfil Temperatura-Tempo (T-t) é alterado 

rapidamente para atingir uma Temperatura (T) onde a densificação 

predominante sobre o crescimento do grão. Desta maneira é possível obter 

um tamanho de grão mínimo mantendo no entanto um grau de densificação 

elevado em materiais policristalinos. O trabalho aqui apresentado irá 

projectar e construir um dispositivo mecânico que permita introduzir 

amostras cerâmicas dentro de um forno com uma rampa de aquecimento 

controlada, enquanto tendo um feedback constante da posição e 

temperatura das amostras.

abstract 

 

The processes that occur during sintering of polycrystalline systems, 

are those of particle necking, densification, grain coarsening, porosity 

control, and segregation. These processes result from three mass 

transport mechanisms: surface condensation/evaporation, grain 

boundary diffusion, and lattice diffusion. The final microstructure can 

be varied by forcing a specific phenomenon to predominate over the 

others during the sintering process. For example, the fast-firing 

process represents a sintering procedure where the temperature–

time (T–t) profile is altered to rapidly reach the T regime where 

densification dominates over grain growth. In this way, a small grain 

size can be maintained while still offering a high densification of 

polycrystalline materials. Therefore, the current work will design and 

build a mechanical device, to introduce ceramic samples into a 

furnace at a controlled ramp rate, with an instantaneous 

temperature/motion feedback loop.

Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

1 INTRODUCTION 

Nowadays given the continued evolution of materials based technologies, has driven the need for 

materials offering a specific set of pre-determined characteristics that are often closely linked 

with their microstructure. For this reason, the ability to control sintering mechanisms during the 

densification of ceramics has become an essential tool with which to tailor final properties such as 

electrical behavior, porosity and strength. 

The objective of this work focuses on the design and construction of a mechanical device for use 

at a laboratorial level, which is capable of controlling the sintering of ceramic samples up to high 

ramp rates, while recording this data for subsequent analysis.  Normally ramp rates greater than 

50ºC/min are difficult to achieve with standard furnaces due to damage to the heating elements 

and insulation caused by the rapid heating. In contrast, the current design avoids this limitation by 

maintaining a constant furnace temperature and controlling effective temperature instead by the 

positioning of the sample in the hot zone. 

The thesis is organized in five chapters, commencing with a bibliographic revision. In this first 

chapter particular focus is given to the sintering process. The theory of the sintering process is 

described, highlighting its controlling mechanisms .Various sintering methods are briefly 

explained and the salient method of this thesis, fast firing, is explained in more detail.  

The second chapter outlines the theory of the technology selected in this project for the 

construction of the fast firing device. 

The third chapter is dedicated to the description of the methodology and the design of the 

mechanical device and the selection of the materials and equipments acquired and assembled. 

This chapter also explains the operating principles for the control of the device. 

In the fourth chapter, the experimental results and limitations of the device are explored as a 

function of different target temperatures and desired ramp rates  

The overall conclusions are presented in the fifth chapter. This chapter discusses the outcome of 

the project and offers insight of potential future work to improve on the current performance.

2.1 SINTERING 

By definition sintering can be described as the consolidation, densification, recrystallization and 

bonding between agglomerated powders during or following compaction, at temperatures below 

the melting point of the material (1) or as Herring defined sintering is “…understood to mean any 

changes in shape which a small or a cluster of particles of uniform composition undergoes when 

held at high temperature” (2). 

There are four basic types of sintering processes; they are solid-state sintering (Figure 1), liquid-

phase sintering, viscous sintering and vitrification. This paper is fully dedicated to the solid-state 

sintering process. During this sintering process occurs particle necking, densification, grain 

coarsening, porosity control and segregation. 

 

 

Figure 1- Solid-state sintering (1). 

 

Over the years there were experimental studies and theoretical analyses that formed an 

exceptional qualitative understanding of sintering in terms of the driving forces, the mechanisms, 

and the influence of the principal processing variables such as particle size, temperature and 

applied pressure (3). 

There are a number of parameters that can be easily identified on the sintering process, as the 

Table 1 lists.

Some of the parameters can be controlled precisely such as the sintering temperature, the 

average particle size and the atmosphere while others such as the powder characteristics and 

particle packing are more difficult to control but still having a significant effect on the process. 

2.1.1 SINTERING STAGES 

The sintering process in solid-state sintering has three main stages. A sintering stage can be 

described as an “interval of geometric change in which pore shape is totally defined (such as 

rounding of necks during the initial stage sintering) or an interval of time during which the pore 

remain constant in shape while decreasing in size” (4). The sintering stages are named as initial, 

intermediate and final stage. 

 

Figure 2- Ceramics model before sintering (5). 

 

During the initial stage (Figure 3), the interparticle contact area increases by neck growth from 0 

to almost 0.2. A reasonably rapid interparticle neck growth occurs in this stage either by diffusion, 

vapor transport, plastic flow or viscous flow. The relative density increases from 60 to 65 percent 

(6). The initial stage as indicated by Coble, involves no grain growth (7). 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       6   

 

Figure 3- Model of the initial stage sintering (5). 

 

The intermediate stage only begins after the pores have reached their equilibrium shapes as 

dictated by the surface and interfacial tensions. This stage is characterized by the continuous pore 

channels that are coincident with three-grain edges (Figure 4). The densification is assumed to 

occur by the pores simply shrinking to reduce their cross section and by having matter diffuse 

toward and vacancies away from the long cylindrical channels the relative density is increased by 

65 to 90 percent (5) . By the time the pores become unstable and the separation starts isolated 

pores eventually begin to appear, this phenomena represents the ending of this stage (8). Most of 

the densification and microstructures changes take place in this intermediate stage. 

 

 

Figure 4- Model of the intermediate stage sintering (5). 

 

When the pore phase eventually pinches off the final stage beings (Figure 5), it is characterized by 

the absence of a continuous pore channel. In this stage the pores are supposed to shrink

continuously and acquire a lenticular shape if residing on the grain boundaries or rounded if 

residing within a grain. The mobility of grain boundaries and pores are increased, this factor must 

be controlled in order to achieve the required the theoretical density (5). 

 

Figure 5- Model of the final stage sintering (5). 

 

2.1.2 MICROSTRUCTURE CONTROL 

Properties, such as the size and shape of the grains, the pore size and distribution in the body and 

the nature, and distribution of second phases are in the realm, of microstructure control and this 

greatly influences the engineering properties of ceramics. The sintering behavior and final grain 

size are affected in particular by the particle size of the starting ceramic material, the degree of 

accumulation and also by the microstructure of the green body, which in addition is also 

determined by the shaping technology used. 

Usually while sintering occurs the coarsening of the microstructure due to the densification of the 

polycrystalline powder, the average size of the pores and grains gets greater. This phenomenon is 

very complex but simple approaches taken by engineers indicate that the achievement of high 

density and controlled grain size is dependent on reducing the grain growth rate or increasing the 

density rate (or a combination of both) (3). 

To understand the sintering phenomena occurring while the sample material is at work we must 

first determine the type of densification taking place. There are various types such as solid-state, 

viscous, liquid-phase and vitrification sintering. The sintering process applied on the material at 

work produces densification of the solid-state type.

2.1.3 MECHANISMS OF DIFFUSION 

Mechanisms of sintering are the phenomenon that allows the sintering of polycrystalline 

materials; this occurs by diffusion transport of matter along definite paths. There are six diverse 

mechanisms of sintering in polycrystalline materials, such as surface, lattice (the effect of lattice 

diffusion differs when it is located at the surface or on the grain boundary regions) and grain 

boundary diffusion, plastic flow and vapor transport, as can be seen in the Figure 6.  

 

Figure 6- Distinct mechanisms of sintering on polycrystalline materials (3). 

 

But only some lead to shrinkage or densification of the material. The distinction is usually made 

between densifying and nondensifying mechanisms. The nondensifying mechanisms are the 

diffusion mechanism, lattice diffusion from the particles surfaces to the neck and vapor transport. 

They belong to this group because while leading to neck growth they promote no densification of 

the materials. The densifying mechanisms are the grain boundary diffusion and lattice diffusion 

from the grain boundary to the pore; these are the most important sintering mechanisms while 

sintering polycrystalline ceramics. Lattice diffusion from the grain boundary to the pore also leads 

to neck growth. Plastic flow mechanism also leads to densification but the effect is much more 

common on sintering of metal powders. 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

During the sintering process there are transport mechanisms activated by increasing the 

temperature inducing then grain growth and densification on the material being sintered. The 

availability of several matter transport paths and the presence of grain boundaries increase the 

complexity of the sintering phenomena in polycrystalline materials over other types of sintering 

methods.  

Diffusion in the boundaries of polycrystalline bodies is recognized as influencing many physical 

and metallurgical processes such as grain growth, re-crystallization, plastic deformation and 

whisker growth (8) 

The major solid-state mechanisms of matter transport in sintering of polycrystalline material are 

lattice diffusion (also referred to as volume or bulk diffusion), grain boundary diffusion and 

surface diffusion (condensation/evaporation) (9). 

Each mechanism of diffusion has a different impact while the sintering of polycrystalline ceramics 

takes place. While coarsening and grain growth are primarily related to surface and grain 

boundary diffusion, the impact of lattice diffusion is mainly on densification and porosity 

elimination, where the grain boundary diffusion type has lower influence. By understanding the 

mechanism of diffusion, it is possible to influence which mechanism has the dominant effect and 

in this way to control the final microstructure. 

The diffusion coefficient Di(T) is defined according to the next expression:

Where D0 is a constant, Qi is the activation energy of the diffusion process; R is the gas constant 

and T the absolute temperature. The fact that the diffusion phenomena are thermally activated in 

solid materials creates the possibility to control the resultant microstructure by manipulation of 

the characteristic temperature dependences of each process. For polycrystalline materials the

2.1.3.1 LATTICE DIFFUSION 

Lattice diffusion refers to atomic diffusion within a crystalline lattice (4). The mechanism of lattice 

diffusion changes according to the type of defect encountered. It can be either vacancy or 

interstitial defects being the mechanism designed as vacancy mechanism or interstitial 

mechanism correspondently. This phenomenon involves grain bulk and involves a higher 

activation energy than the surface mechanisms. Although there are four types of lattice diffusion 

there are two mechanisms that have the most influence and therefore gain more importance. 

These are the vacancy and interstitial mechanism, the others are the interstitialcy and the ring 

mechanisms (3). These mechanisms will be described briefly below. 

 

2.1.3.1.1 Vacancy mechanism 

Atoms on a normal lattice site exchange places with a vacant site. The vacancy concentration is 

affected by the temperature, solute and atmosphere. The diffusion coefficients of the atoms and 

the vacancies are related but not equal. An atom can only jump if a vacancy is located on an 

adjacent lattice site, but a vacancy can jump to any of the occupied nearest neighbor sites. The 

number of atomic jumps will be then proportional to the fraction of sites occupied by vacancies 

(Cv). The relation between the coefficients atomic diffusion and vacancy diffusion can be 

explained by the follow expression: 

 

a v v
D C D= ×    (2.3) 

 

Being Da, Atomic diffusion coefficient, Dv, vacancy diffusion coefficient and Cv, fraction of sites 

occupied by vacancies. 

The Figure 7 represents the vacancy mechanism phenomenon.

Figure 7- Lattice diffusion by vacancy mechanism (3). 

 

2.1.3.1.2 Interstitial mechanism 

The interstitial defect phenomenon takes place when atoms which occupy a site in the crystal 

structure at which there is usually not an atom, or two or more lattice sites such that the number 

of atoms is larger than the number of lattice sites. This happens when the solute or regular atoms 

are small enough to be located in the interstitial sites of the lattice (Figure 8).

A relationship analogous to the equation that represents the vacancy phenomenon can still be 

used:

Being Dic, interstitial diffusion coefficient and Ci , concentration of the interstitial atoms. 

  

2.1.3.1.3 Interstitialcy mechanism 

 

If the distortion of the lattice becomes too large for interstitial diffusion to be favorable, then 

movement of the interstitial atoms may occur by the interstitialcy mechanism. An atom on the

regular lattice site exchanges position with a neighboring interstitial atom (they do not need to be 

the same type of atoms) (Figure 9). 

 

 

Figure 9- Lattice diffusion by interstitialcy mechanism (3). 

 

2.1.3.1.4 Ring mechanism 

In ring mechanism an atom exchange takes place by rotation in a circle without the participation 

of a defect. Several atoms can participate in a simultaneous exchange. The significant momentary 

distortion couple with the large energy changes arising from electrostatic repulsion makes this 

mechanism improbable in ionic solids (Figure 10). 

 

 

Figure 10- Lattice diffusion by ring mechanism (3). 

 

Other mechanisms of diffusion as referred before are the grain boundary diffusion and the 

surface diffusion  

2.1.3.2 GRAIN BOUNDARY DIFFUSION 

 Grain boundary diffusion plays a key role (by often controlling the evolution of structure and 

properties of the materials)in many processes occurring in polycrystalline bodies at elevated 

temperatures, such as Coble creep, sintering, diffusion-induced GB migration (DIGM), different 

discontinuous reactions, recrystallization and grain growth (11). Grain boundaries in 

polycrystalline materials are the designation of the separation between crystal (also known as 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 13 

grains) from each other by regions of lattice mismatch and disorder. Grain boundary diffusion can 

be swifter than the lattice diffusion in the adjacent grains because of the highly defective nature 

of the grain boundary. The grain boundary diffusion is affected by the grain size present in the 

material, so to obtain a constant grain boundary width the fraction of the solid that is occupied by 

the grain boundary increases with the decreasing grain size (3). Grain boundary diffusion is 

sensitive to the grain boundary structure and chemical composition and it the diffusion can be 

studied with modern radiotracer methods without disturbing the grain boundary state (11). 

Most mathematical treatments of Grain boundary diffusion are based on Fisher´s model (12) 

2.1.3.3 SURFACE DIFFUSION 

This type of diffusion plays an important part in crystal and film growth, in evaporation and 

condensation, in surface chemical reaction and catalysis, in sintering as well as in other surface 

processes.

3 CONTROLLING THE FIRING (SCHEDULE) 

Fast Firing, also known as rapid sintering, is a sintering process where the heating cycle control 

subjects the sample material to a short firing at high temperatures. For some materials, this 

process will provide equivalent densities at smaller grain sizes in a less energy consuming process. 

To have benefits from the use of this process several parameters need to be known before 

starting the sintering such as: The controlling mechanism for the process of densification and 

coarsening and reliable data for the activation energies for the appropriate diffusion coefficients.  

The best situation to utilize the fast firing technique is when the activation energy for 

densification is greater than the energy for coarsening, meaning that at higher temperatures the 

densification rate would be faster than the coarsening rate (3), Figure 11. 

 

Figure 11- Effect of a fast heating rate on a ceramic material (3). 

 

The process usually involves a rapid insertion of a specimen into a preheated furnace at high 

temperatures followed by soaking at maximum temperature for shorter times than used in 

conventional sintering (4). 

Densification with lower grain growth is achieved due to the rapid passage of the sample 

thorough the low temperature regime where grain coarsening dominates, into the region where 

the densification mechanisms prevail. A fast heat-up can provide an effective route for the 

formation of a dense material, while avoiding grain growth, where??? &gt; ??.  



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       16   

The occurrence of heat conduction happens during the process because energy is absorbed in the 

surface of the material which is then transferred into the bulk of the sample. 

Figure 12 shows an example of fast firing, selected from the literature. A series of experiments to 

test the different fabrication process of Al2O3 doped with 200 parts-per-million (ppm) MgO were 

performed. This figure illustrates clearly that choosing the right process is crucial for the 

microstructure control and the fast firing technique can provide dense samples with reduced 

grain size. 

 

Figure 12- Experimental results for microstructural development / grain size versus density trajectories 

for fabrication by hot pressing, conventional sintering and fast firing (7) 

 

As stated by Bradeau (5) the temperature gradient is very significant in mass transportation, 

further analysis in this subject by Searcy suggests that temperature in driving densification during 

fast firing (9). Improved diffusion is then a result of fast sintering the sample as undertook 

3.1 SUPPORT TECHNOLOGIES 

To successfully control the system a real time analysis of parameters assumes a vital importance. 

The constant monitoring of the different parameters, such as temperature, position and the 

human input controls must be made instantaneously without flaws in the receiving or sending of 

the data packages. Such feedback is essential for optimum control of the system and for it to be 

autonomous use. 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 17 

To implement the monitoring and control several technologies were considered for the 

development of the system. In the current section different existing protocols will be addressed to 

enable the communication between devices with enough functionality to control the system. The 

used protocols and equipments are in agreement with the model Open Systems Interconnection 

(OSI) (13). 

The OSI model was created by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as an answer to the 

increasing number of architectures of proprietary and specific communications protocols by a 

particular manufacturer. This model serves as a reference by which others can be created. The 

OSI model was originally developed to be a detailed specification of an abstract interface. It is no 

more than a description or model of reference of how the information must be transmitted 

between two equipments on a network, regardless of any hardware being used (14). This model is 

organized in seven layers, the order of the diverse layers can be understood by reference to the 

Figure 13. 

 

Figure 13- Layers of OSI model (Edited from (14)). 

 

The application layer is responsible for the support to the user applications. This goes for either 

the receiving side or the receptor. Services of files transfer (FTP), email are some of the examples 

of services available in the libraries of this layer. 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       18   

The presentation layer is responsible for the delivery and formatting the information to the 

application layer for further processing or display. It relieves the application layer of concern 

regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems. This layer 

deals with issues of string representation. There are applications and protocols where no 

distinction is made between the application and presentation layer for example, the HTTP 

protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol) generally regarded as an application layer protocol, has 

Presentation Layer aspects such as the ability to identify character encoding for proper 

conversion, which is then done in the application layer. 

The session layer is the fifth layer of the OSI model of computer networking. This layer provides 

the mechanism for opening, closing and managing a session between end-user application 

processes. The communication sessions consist of a request and responses that occur between 

applications. These services are normally used in application environments that make use of 

remote procedure calls (RPCs). The Session layer responds to service request from the 

Presentation layer and issues service request to the transport layer. The Session Layer of the OSI 

model is responsible for session checkpointing and recovery. It allows information of different 

streams, perhaps originating from different sources, to be properly combined or synchronized. 

3.1.1 PHYSICAL LAYER PROTOCOLS 

The serial standard Rs-232 was developed in 1962 by EIA (“Electronic Industries Association), with 

the goal to enable the communication between a computer and a modem; nowadays it is 

available to a bigger range of other connections (15). This standard suffered some revisions since 

it was created, being the last the Rs-232-F made in 1997. As with any other serial transmission 

equipment, the bits are sent one by one sequentially and usually with the left bit being the less 

significant (LSB). For being an asynchronous protocol (without a clock line) it is the emitter and 

receiver responsibility to coordinate the respective time cycles to start and end each bit. The 

signals on a Rs-232 communication are transmitted with voltage of ±5V. 

In its standard form the Rs-232 protocol uses two different control signals, the RTS (Ready to 

Send) and the CTS (Clear to Send) to manage the flux of data exchange by hardware ( Whenever 

the emitter starts sending  data the RTS pin is flagged. The RTS pin being flagged makes the 

receiver understand that there is data arriving the CTS pin goes to the level high (as “1”) 

confirming the sending (“Acknowledge”). Only after receiving the signal from the CTS pin can the 

emitter start the transmission. The RS-232 standard defines the electrical, mechanical and 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 19 

functional characteristics allowed. The transmission rate and maximum extend of the line are not 

defined, but they are normally 115200 bit/s and the capacitance should not exceed 2500 pF, 

respectively (15). 

This standard does not define the settings to be used by the data connection. Normally seven or 

eight bits of data are used and one start bit to initiate of the string and one or two to end the 

same. Other bits may be included to control the errors (Parity bit) and the flux control by 

hardware or software. 

The connection made by equipments is usually done through wires with connector (DB-25 or DB-

9, being the last one the most used nowadays). In the Figure 14 can be seen both types of 

connectors referred in a connection between two equipments. 

 

Figure 14- Rs-232 communication between a computer and a terminal (15). 

 

 

Currently the Rs-232 standard communication is being gradually substituted by the USB standard 

for the local connection, because the USB is faster, has easier to use connectors and possesses a 

better software support. But the Rs-232 is still being used in many vending points (bar code 

registers, or magnetic tape, amongst others) and in industrial machinery (remotely controlled 

devices). For this reason some computers have inbuilt Rs-232 doors (onboard, or in boards with  

PCI or ISA bus enabled)  , although even if most modern computers don´t have this function 

available there are USB to Rs-232 converters that fix this aspect.  

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is used primarily for a synchronous serial communication of 

host processor and peripherals.  



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       

The SPI can be used with a wide variety of peripheral equipments and they can be subdivided into 

the following categories (16): 

? Converters (ADC and DAC)

? Memories (EEPROM and FLASH)

? Real Time Clocks (RTC) 

? Sensors (temperature, pressure)

? Others (signalmixer, potentiometer, LCD controller, UART, CAN controller, USB controller, 

amplifier) 

The standard configuration for a slave device is

With this configuration two control and two data lines are used. To enable this standard there 

must be a master device and a slave device. The master provides a clock signal and determines 

the state of the chip select lines (this function determines which slave the master is 

communicating with). Using the master/slave relationship, the master starts the communication 

by generating a clock and selecting the device, the data can be transferred on both directions 

simultaneously (by definition data is always sent both directions but it is

which peripheral device it wants to communicate. The clock line SCLK is brought to the device 

whether it is selected or not. The clock serves as synchronization of the data communication(18). 

The majority of SPI devices provide these four lines. Sometimes it happens that SDI and SDO are 

multiplexed, for example in the temperature sensor LM74, or that one of these lines is missing. A 

peripheral device that must or cannot be configured requires no input line, only a data output for 

example the integrated circuits Max6675 or Max31885. As soon as it becomes selected it starts 

sending data. In some ADCs, therefore, the SDI line is missing. There are also devices that have no 

data output. For example, LCD controllers that can be configured, but cannot send data or status 

messages. 

Figure 16 describes the control over a number of slave devices by splitting the CS pins into a 

number equal to the slave devices needed, the slave enabled and consequently the one that is 

sending/receiving data is determined by the state of the CS pin (High or Low states) that is 

changed the program sent to the microchip.

3.2.3 DESIGN OF A MICROCONTROLLER 

 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 25 

The design of the microcontroller incorporates all of the features found in a microprocessor 

(ALU,PC ,SP and the registers), also adding other features required to perform all the operations a 

computer can do such as ROM(read-only memory),RAM (random access memory), parallel I/O, 

serial I/O, counters and a clock circuit. 

The main use of the microcontroller is to control the operation of a machine using a fixed 

program that is stored in ROM and that does not change over the lifetime of the system (20). The 

design it took makes it usable on many applications, it accomplishes this feat by having a very 

flexible and extensive repertoire of multi-byte instructions (21), the hardware configuration. 

There are tools and resources needed to work with microcontrollers in this work we used a 

microchip microcontroller (Picmicro) such as: 

? An assembler or a high-level language compiler (C language with Hi-Tech C compiler). 

? A computer to run the software and develop it. 

? A hardware device (Programmer) that connects through the serial, parallel or USB 

line.  

? Cables to connect the programmer to the computer and to connect the Pic to the 

programmer. 

? Pic microcontroller. 

Prototypes circuits are usually made in breadboards and we followed this “trend” by building a 

fully operational controller in the breadboard. 

There are at least a dozen manufactures of microchips in the world and each has its own assembly 

language to program the devices, so as a result, a decade ago every time a user changed the type 

of the device it would have to recode/learn a new programming language before starting to 

elaborate a project. Nowadays, there are high-level language compilers that can translate the 

code into numeric values for the PICmicro (Hexadecimal). These compilers offer many advantages 

to the programmer such as the multi-platforming, program maintenance, the posterior testing 

and the lower probability of having errors within the code. Nonetheless, it also has some short 

comings such as the memory it takes on the microcontroller, the length of code becomes greater 

and it runs usually slower.

3.2.4 INTERFACE APPLICATION 

The interface application is at core a program that enables the user to control and view the results 

that the system is performing with each command without having to understand how the system 

works or the underlying logic of the stored program. It is intended to be simple, intuitive, efficient 

and responsive to let the user to start working and finish the task at hand without much effort or 

time needed to learn it. 

This is, as a rule, called as graphical user interface (GUI). The term came into existence because 

the first interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical; they were text-and-keyboard 

oriented and usually consisted of commands you had to remember and computer responses that 

were infamously brief. The command interface of the DOS operating system (which you can still 

get to from your Windows operating system) is an example of the typical user-computer interface 

before GUIs arrived. An intermediate step in user interfaces between  

To create the interface application the software Microsof Visual Basic 2010 Express was used. 

Visual Basic 2010 Express is Microsoft´s latest version of Visual Basic.NET programming language. 

This software greatest strength is its ease of use and the speed it enables the programmer to

Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

4 PROJECT 

As mentioned in the state of art, to sinter samples using the method of fast-firing it is required to 

achieve high temperatures under a certain fraction of time. This work aims to project and build a 

system that successfully accomplishes this goal. The fast firing project had some pre-requisites 

has minimum temperature on the furnace of 1250 °C and the furnace also had to be open on both 

sides, the linear guide to possess a speed of 200 mm/s and the real time answer of the circuit. The 

project was planned in function of the process to be used, the size of the equipment and the 

assembly of the different would need to be clear and simple. A limited budget was also taken in 

account.  

 

4.1 FAST FIRING PROCESS 

The fast firing process can be applied at least by two different ways: i) fast firing process with 

adjustable temperature and constant position, or ii) variable position with constant gradient of 

temperature in the furnace.  

4.1.1 ADJUSTABLE TEMPERATURE 

During the sintering process the samples used in the experiment are maintained in the same place 

while the temperature is controlled by a computer or a PLC. 

One of the advantages of this method is the space occupied by the machine. The need for a Belt 

or a linear guide is non-existent since the ceramic samples are stationary. 

A representation of this method is explained on the following Figure 21.

Figure 21- Method for controlling the firing of ceramics (United States Patent 6511628). 

 

4.1.2 CONSTANT GRADIENT OF TEMPERATURE 

The constant gradient of temperature consists on having a controlled belt or linear guide to move 

the materials in the furnace at a given ratio. The temperature inside the furnace has a known 

gradient along its course. The movement/speed of the materials is calculated using the uniform 

temperature distribution.  

This method allows the sintering of materials in a continuous way by allowing various materials to 

be processed at the same time; this fact makes this method very useful and a reason why it is so 

widely used in the industry. One example of these fast firing furnaces can be found on the Figure 

22.

4.2 FAST FIRING PROJECT 

The chosen method used on this work was the constant gradient of temperature, based on the 

method explained on the subchapter 4.1.2. This version does not reach the high costs of the 

example mentioned, while performing and executing the experiment with an acceptable precision 

of the results. The furnace although does not have a controlled atmosphere (because it is open on 

both sides) and the linear guide does not allow multiple samples to be sintered at the same time. 

The project consists on controlling the Temperature/Time ramp. To this it was developed a 

project which used a Thermocouple, a linear guide, a step motor, a furnace and various support 

components. 

4.3 CONTROL SYSTEM 

The control system designed and built for this particular work can be visualized in the scheme 

(Figure 23). The flow of information (data packages) between the devices can be understood by 

interpretation of the scheme.

                                                                                       30   

 

Figure 23- Control system scheme. 

 

The system was designed with the objective of being both easy to understand by the usual user 

and the possible engineer who might want to upgrade or change any aspect or parameter of this 

system. 

The flow of the information is described by the scheme presented in Figure 23.  

The measurements of the temperature at the position of the samples, is done by the 

thermocouple. These data are then translated into an analog signal in the microcontroller. After 

this the temperature is sent to an application installed in the computer over a RS-232 

communication as a data string (this string also includes the position of the sample holder). If 

using the automated movement of the motor the user is then prompted to choose a sintering 

rate, then with an algorithm created with the objective of controlling the speed of the motor 

receives the temperature and position of the samples and decides what is the proper speed to 

produce the effect of sintering on the samples material, or the direction of the movement 

depending on which mode of operation the user is working After calculating the adequate speed, 

the information is transmitted to the microcontroller (again over the RS-232 communication). 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 31 

After this step, the motor will start moving at the speed wanted and on the liquid crystal display 

(LCD) both the sintering rate and the current position of the samples are shown. 

4.4 MICROCONTROLLER  

The electrical circuit was developed with the objective to control the movement of the “CAR” that 

supports the alumina bar carrying the samples to be sintered. This movement is controlled 

rigorously with a status check of the data (Temperature of the samples and the position of the 

CAR).  

When building industrial or commercial machinery we can apply a multitude of procedures. We 

could choose to use microcontrollers (as was opted in this case), programmable logic controllers 

(also known as “PLC”) or the use of interconnected relays designed using ladder logic. These are 

logic controlled systems that may respond to switches or light, pressure sensors between others. 

With the response we can have the machine do a number of tasks such as start or stop. 

The microcontroller was chosen for the present device by the fact that it is lighter, smaller, but 

mostly because it is a much cheaper device than a programmable logic controller (PLC). Although 

there are some benefits in having a PLC, such as robustness (it can endure sand and hits, which 

makes it more suitable for industrial applications) and the ladder logic used is much easier to 

understand and rewrite, there are not enough reasons to justify the cost of this option in the 

current work. 

The microcontroller selected was the PIC 16F877 (Figure 24).

                                                                                       32   

 

Figure 24- PIC 16F877 as in the datasheet (datasheet). 

 

Some of the characteristics it possess can be directly extracted from its name  

 

Being,   

A: Number “16” which symbolizes the MID-Range devices from microchip. It belongs to the 8 bit 

family, meaning that the ALU (Arithmetic and Logique Unit) is read with words with the length 

having the maximum of 8. 

B: Letter “F” is followed by the meaning that the PIC is of the Flash type. Each line of memory is a 

14 word bits. 

C: Numbers “877” allows us to know exactly the PIC we have chosen between all the other series 

of devices. 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

Flash memory is non volatile, so it can be used to store the user program and for posterior use it 

can be erased or reprogrammed electrically. Although there are other devices with more than 8k 

program memory it was decided that for the control system at hand it would not be need any 

more memory. In the future if any data should be stored it can always be built within the circuit 

an EEPROM memory for data storage and for the use of the microcontroller during the process. 

The organization of the pins is described in the Figure 25; with this information the 

building/programming of the project can be started. 

For this work the crystal oscillator type used was the 4Mhz, it is an electronic oscillator that uses 

the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical 

signal with a very precise frequency. This provides a stable clock signal for digital integrated 

circuits. The oscillator belongs in the pins numbered as 13 and 14 (OSC1 / OSC2) 

The Pin 1 is designed as MCLR/Vpp/THV is the mode on which the microcontroller boots in, either 

in programmer mode (to insert the program the developer created), master clear entry (Reset), or 

high voltage test control. It is decided the way it boots with voltage supplied to this pin, for 

example to start running the program is 5V and to enable programming mode it is 4V.

In order to reduce the confusion and to offer a better understanding it will be used in the circuit 

diagrams the simplified representation of the microcontroller Pic 16F877.In this the I/O Ports are 

organized in order of groups and numbers inside the groups, and the voltage supplier and the 

ground pins are not represented. 

Some of the I/O Ports are multiplexed with alternative functions to access features from 

peripheral devices, being this the main reason to have five main groups in this device (Port A, B, C, 

D, E). For example most I/O pins on Port A can be used as either a general I/O pin or as an analog 

input (this function is being used to receive the measurements of the thermocouple), on Port C 

the I/O pins RC6 and RC7 are used as the transmitter and receiver respectively of the data 

packages over the RS-232 communication. 

For the project the general purpose of each I/O ports are as followed: 

Port A – Status LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) 

Port B – Stepper motor involved circuitry 

Port C – RS-232 communication and Temperature measurement 

Port D – LCD involved circuitry 

Port E – Control buttons and interrupts 

4.5 BIPOLAR STEPPER MOTOR 

After careful considerations, the type of motor chosen was the stepper motor. 

The stepper motor is an electromechanical device that converts electrical pulses into discrete 

mechanical movements. The shaft or spindle of a stepper motor rotates in discrete step 

increments when electrical command pulses are applied to it in the proper sequence. The motor 

rotation has several direct relationships to this applied pulse. The sequence of the input pulses 

influences directly the direction of the movement as well as the speed by the frequency the input 

pulses occur, while the number of input pulses is related to the length of the motor rotation. 

The stepper motor is used on a very wide number of applications thanks to its precision, 

reliability, precise positioning and the repetition of the same movement. The accuracy of a step 

motor is of 3 – 5% per step and this is error is not cumulative from one to step to the next, but it 

has as a disadvantage due to the difficulty of controlling the operation at high speeds. 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 35 

There are three basic stepper motor types: 

? Variable-reluctance (“VR”) 

? Permanent-magnet (“PM”) 

? Hybrid 

The stepper motor used in this work is a hybrid one. As the name indicates this motor is a 

combination between the two other types and it groups the best features of the permanent-

magnet and the variable reluctance motor types.  The hybrid stepper motor although being more 

expensive than a permanent-magnet type, provides better performance concerning step 

resolution, torque and speed. The range of the step angles usually vary between 3.6° to 0.9° (100-

400 steps per revolution). The rotor is multi-toothed like the VR motor and contains an axially 

magnetized concentric magnet around its shaft. The teeth on the rotor provide an even better 

path that helps guide the magnetic flux to preferred locations in the air gap. This further increases 

the detent, holding and dynamic torque (15). 

The step motors are mostly two-phase motors (the motor chosen is also a two phase motor). 

These can be unipolar (Figure 26) or bipolar (Figure 27). 

 

 

Figure 26- Unipolar stepper motors. 

 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       36   

 

Figure 27- Bipolar stepper motor. 

 

In unipolar step motor there are two winding per phase. The two winding to a pole may have one 

lead common i.e. centre tapped. The unipolar motor so, have five, six or eight leads. In the 

designs where the common of two poles are separate but centre tapped, motor have six leads. If 

the centre taps of the two poles are internally short, the motor has five leads. Eight lead unipolar 

facilitates both series and parallel connection whereas five lead and six lead motors have series 

connection of stator coils. The unipolar motor simplifies the operation because in operating them 

there is no need to reverse the current in the driving circuit. These are also called bifilar motors. 

In bipolar stepper there is single winding per pole.These are also called unfiled motors. 

Although it is easier to control the operation of a unipolar stepper motor, the bipolar motor 

produces the maximum speed and torque available for the circuit at hand, this fact occurs due to 

the physical space occupied by the windings. A unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in 

the same space, but only half is used at any point in time, therefore it is only 50% efficient (or in 

the region of 70% of the torque output available). 

To move the stepper motor there are three methods. The stepping method refers to pattern of 

sequence in which the stator coils are energized, they are: 

I. Wave drive 

 

Figure 28- Representation of the Wave drive effect on the stepper motor coils(23). 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 37 

 

In this drive method only a single phase is activated (or energized) at a time. Although it shares 

the same number of steps as the full step drive the motor will be less powerful than it would be 

by using full drive. This phenomenon occurs because only one winding is energized. This is the 

least used stepping method because of the mentioned disadvantage comparing with the other 

methods. 

II. Full drive 

 

 

Figure 29- Representation of the Full drive effect on the stepper motor coils (23). 

With this method there are always two phases energized at any given time. This full step mode 

results in the angular movement as wave drive, but the mechanical position is offset by one-half 

of a full step.  The output torque on the motor will be maximized. 

III. Half drive 

 

 

Figure 30- Representation of the Full drive effect on the stepper motor coils (23). 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       38   

The half drive combines the both methods mentioned before, meaning that the drive alternates 

between two phases on and a single phase on. But while increasing the angular resolution, the 

motor will also have less torque available at the half step position because only one phase is 

energized (approximately 70%). While the two phases are energized the motor will have full rated 

torque. 

The stepping sequences (Table 2) are presented in the following table. Note that the polarity of 

each terminal is indicated with ± and that in the last step of each sequence it loop again endlessly 

until indicated by the controller. To change the direction of the motor it is only needed to reverse 

the stepping sequence.

As mentioned, the stepper motor chosen for this particular work is a bipolar stepper motor. It was 

selected according to the characteristics of a number of existing variables while the operation is 

running (values of friction between the fuse and the car, weight of the sample holder carrier, 

torque needed to move, between others) with this values on hand it the Nema 23 motor was 

selected (Figure 31). Being a usual and standard piece of equipment, it is a component that is easy 

to substitute or replace if anything should happen to it.

4.6 STEPPER MOTOR DRIVER 

The driver board is solely responsible to receive the signal that is sent from the computer and to 

treat and amplify these signals in a way that will make the motor turn. For this project we used 

the Chopper type drive circuit. This circuit provides an optimal solution both to current control 

and fast current build-up and reversal. Chopper drive circuits are also referred to as constant 

current drives because they generate constant current (below the nominal maximum voltage of 

the motor) in each winding rather than applying a constant high voltage. On each new step it will 

apply a very high voltage (normally several times higher than the nominal voltage of the motor) to 

the winding activating the motor all as a consequence creating movement. The ratio VM/Vsupply is 

usually called the overdrive ratio (Figure 32). 

 

 

Figure 32- Current waveform in the basic chopper circuit (23). 

 

Constant current regulation is achieved by switching the output current to the windings. This is 

done by sensing the peak current through the winding via a current-sensing resistor, effectively 

connected in series with the motor winding. As the current increases, a voltage develops across 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing 

 41 

the sensing resistor, which is fed back to the comparator. At the predetermined level, defined by 

the voltage at the reference input, the comparator resets the flip-flop, which turns off the output 

transistor. The current decreases until the clock oscillator triggers the flip-flops, which turns on 

the output transistor again, and the cycle is repeated. The advantage of the constant current 

control is a precise control of the developed torque, regardless of power supply voltage 

variations. It also gives the shortest possible current build-up and reversal time. Power dissipation 

is minimized, as well as supply current. Supply current is not the same as the motor current in a 

copper drive. It is the motor current multiplied by the duty cycle, at standstill typically:

= ×   4.1 

 

Depending on how the H-bridge is switched during the turn-off period, the current will either 

recirculate through one transistor and one diode (path 2), giving the slow current decay, or 

recirculate back through the power supply (path 3). The advantage of feeding the power back to 

the power supply is the fast current decay and the ability to quickly reduce to a lower current 

level. One example is when microstepping at a negative slope, which may be impossible to follow 

if the current decay rate is lower than the slope demands. The disadvantage with fast current 

decay is the increased current ripple, which can cause iron losses in the motor. 

The stepper motor driver has three main components being them the L297 and L298N integrated 

circuits. 

4.6.1 INTEGRATED CIRCUIT L297 

The L297 IC is a stepper motor controller that generates four phase drive signals for two phase 

bipolar and four phase unipolar step motors in microcomputer controlled applications. This 

controller enables the user to drive the stepper motor in every drive described before and on chip 

PWM chopper circuits permit switch-mode control of the current in the windings of the motor. 

One advantage of this particular integrated circuit is that to work it only requires the clock, 

direction and mode input signals. The phase signal is generated internally reducing consequently 

a heavier use on the microcontroller and it simplifies the coding for the programmer. Mounted in 

DIP20 and SO20 packages, the L297 can be used with monolithic bridge drives such as the L298N 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       42   

or the L293R or even discrete transistors, mosfets and darlingtons. In the Figure 32 and in the 

Figure 33 can be seen the L297 real representation and the pin connections, respectively. 

 

Figure 33- Integrated Circuit L297. 

 

Figure 34- L297 Pin connection (Top view) 

     

4.6.2 INTEGRATED CIRCUIT L298N 

The integrated circuit L298N has inbuilt a high current dual full-bridge and its main objective is to 

drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, DC and stepping motors. It is a high voltage part, 

but it can also be activated with a few milivolts, to the maximum voltage range of 45V. It also has 

two pin connections that enable the monitoring of the current circulation that the motor is 

consuming (Pins SENSE-A and SENSE-B), by receiving the given information of the consumed 

current. With the L297 it is also possible to control the current by limiting using a potentiometer. 

For each one of the four outputs it can give an current as high as 2A or as peak current a 

maximum of 4A. 

This device is also known for overheating while working at high voltages and high current. Given 

that the motor works at 24V and 4A it is need to fabricate an heat sink made of aluminium and a 

fan to keep the temperature within the working range temperature of the L298N (it situates itself 

in the range of  -25 °C to 130 °C at the absolute maximum ratings). In the Figure 35 and Figure 36 

can be seen the L298N real representation and the pin connections, respectively.

Figure 35- Integrated Circuit L298N. 

 

Figure 36- L298N Pin connection (Top view)- 

 

Although the usual circuit seen while combining L297 and the L298N (Figure 37) integrated 

circuits is widely used as a stepper motor drive in this case it cannot be used given the high, 

because as referred before the maximum current output per output is of 2A. 

 

 

Figure 37- Two phase bipolar stepper motor control circuit. 

 

To counter this limitation of the L298N it has decided to implement a change in how the circuit 

works. 



Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       44   

The L298N device possess two separate channels (Output 1 and 4, and Output 2 and 3), each one 

capable of driving 2A current loads, so by connecting them in parallel it is possible to drive the 

motor with inductive loads up to 4A continuously because it will become a single 4A integrated 

circuit driver, this can be achieved by following the circuit as seen on Figure 38. 

 

 

Figure 38-Circuit of L298N integrated circuit as a 4A single driver. 

 

Being, W1 and W2 the one of each pair of outputs of the L297 device and J1 one of the windings 

in the motor. As referred before by using this implementation it is required a second L298N 

device in order to connect to the second pair of outputs of L297 and the second winding on the 

motor

4.7 EIA-232 DRIVER/RECEIVER 

 

Figure 39-Integrated circuit Max232. 

 

The MAX232 is an integrated circuit that converts signals from an RS-232 serial port to signals 

suitable for use in TTL compatible digital logic circuits. The MAX232 is a dual driver/receiver and 

typically converts the RX, TX, CTS and RTS signals. 

The drivers provide RS-232 voltage level outputs (approx. ± 7.5 V) from a single + 5 V supply via 

on-chip charge pumps and external capacitors. This makes it useful for implementing RS-232 in 

devices that otherwise do not need any voltages outside the 0 V to + 5 V range, as power supply 

design does not need to be made more complicated just for driving the RS-232 in this case. 

The receivers reduce RS-232 inputs (which may be as high as ± 25 V), to standard 5 V TTL levels. 

These receivers have a typical threshold of 1.3 V, and a typical hysteresis of 0.5 V.

With this furnace it is possible to control both maximum temperature and the rate of heating. It is 

a cylindrical oven with two entries (both sides are open enabling the sample holder to enter from 

either side) as can be seen in Figure 43. 

 

 

Figure 43-Entry point of view of the oven. 

 

One of the objectives successfully obtained with this furnace is the nullification of the 

electromagnetic forces while not obtaining a long hot zone while maintaining the required 

gradient of temperatures (the dispersion of the temperature is not homogenous) on the ceramic 

cylinder. This fact can be also seen on the Figure 43 by noting the increase of the temperature 

with the higher distance. 

The heating is produced by a resistor constructed with Kanthal A1 wire. It has 3.75mm of 

diameter. The power supply of this resistor is one with low voltage. The total dissipated power 

output by the heating element has a maximum value of 1.200 W.

4.9.1 THERMOCOUPLE / MAXIM MAX31855 IC 

To measure the temperature of the sample holder a thermocouple of the type K is used. This 

thermocouple can read temperatures that belong to the range of -180 °C to 1300 °C. 

 

Figure 46- Thermocouple Type K 

The thermocouple is connected to an integrated circuit ("IC") with designation max31855. The 

max31855 is an IC that performs cold-junction compensation and digitalizes the signal from the 

thermocouple it is connected to. The output data from this IC has the format describe on Table 4.

the maximum temperature allowed by this IC is 1800 °C (far above the maximum required by this 

project, approximately +- 1250 °C) being the minimum -270 °C, it resolves temperatures to 0.25 

°C. The accuracy of the measurement of the temperature for temperatures ranging from -200 °C 

to +700 °C is of +-2 °C and from 700 °C to 1300 °C the range being +-4 °C.

Having the Serial peripheral interface bus (also known as "SPI") implies that we have a 

master/slave combination; the master is the Pic16f877 and the slave the IC max31855. This 

interface is a serial data link that operates in full duplex mode. The master device is the one to 

start the transmission of data.  

To measure the temperature of the sample holder a thermocouple of the type K is used. This 

thermocouple can read temperatures that belong to the range of -180 °C to 1300 °C

4.10 MECHANIC EQUIPMENT 

As it was referred previously the samples are inserted in the furnace via a cylindrical bar of 

Alumina. The bar needs to be hollow to insert the thermocouple and the fiberglass cotton to 

encompass the samples. The outer diameter must also be large enough to sustain the samples 

while not touching the walls of the furnace to not jeopardize the furnace, the experimental tests 

or even the alumina bar.

To allow simple assembly/dismantling the linear guide does not have a support beneath it, 

instead it was developed in a manner to allow the movement on the Z axis (height) to adjust the 

height of the center of the alumina bar with the center of the furnace.

4.11.1 PROGRAMMING 

For the programming of the microprocessor was used MPLAB ID v8.56 with the compiler Hi-Tech 

Pro Lite.  

The C programming language was used to develop the program needed to accomplish the tasks 

that this dissertation demands.  

MPLAB uses by default the assembly language; afterwards it would translate the code into 

numerical values for the PIC (hexadecimal). 

But this language is specific to each device, which means that each program becomes obsolete 

the moment the microcontroller families is changed, this is the main reason that was opted to use 

C language being it general-purpose programming language that can work on any microcontroller 

that has a C compiler working for it. 

The C language has also more programmers and a better library to gather research, this allows 

changes more easily to  be made to the microcontroller we are using and to give it more flexibility 

and specifications that are not used in this dissertation. 

The only fault while programming with C language is the memory which it occupies within the 

microchip. This is one of the limits of this device. The low memory the programmer as allocated to 

code, means that the memory allocation on the microchip is not fully optimized. This is one 

problem we would not have using the assembler language, but the memory given on the 

PIC16F877 is enough for the coding necessary to fulfill the task at hand. 

Hi-Tech Pro Lite is a C language compiler, this software is free to use and it optimizes ANSI C 

language. This compiler supports all microchip in this range PIC10,PIC 12 and PIC16 devices. 

The compiler is also available on a number of popular operating systems such as Windows (32 and 

64-bit), Linux and Apple OS X. 

Being this the free version of the Hi-Tech compiler it does not make use of the Omniscient Code 

Generation (OCG) technology, it improves the compilation of the code to a degree of 40% 

reduction of memory allocation on the microcontroller. This allows future uses of the code 

generated for this purpose to be expanded for future uses by upgrading to the licensed version of 

Hi-Tech Pro compiler. 

 

 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

The elaboration of the circuit passed through a variety of steps to the final condition. 

 1) Manual control 

 2) Thermocouple value input 

 3) LCD integration 

 4) Encoder programming 

 5) Rs232 connection 

 6) Automatic control 

The manual control of the stepper motor was created to enable the user to control the position 

of the sample holder without having to use the computer (Visual Basic application). Nonetheless, 

the information regarding the temperature and the position of the motor will still be sent to the 

computer and the LCD, enabling the user to have a basic understanding of the system parameters.  

The movement is defined by an interrupter that creates an ON/OFF setting and an additional 

button that creates the CW (Close Wise) or CCW (Counter Clock Wise) movement of the stepper 

motor to reproduce forward or backwards movement of the sample holder. Using this option the 

speed of the motor is predefined and cannot be changed. 

The second step will allow the use of the thermocouple to evaluate the actual temperature of the 

samples.  

The LCD is used in this circuit to enable the user to have real time surveillance over the variables 

of the position of the sample holder and temperature of the samples the sample holder is 

carrying. It is used and LCD of 16 digits per line, having the LCD a maximum of two lines. It will 

display the values like demonstrated on the Figure 54.

Jorge Machado  

                                                                                       58   

A new architecture was used on this particular LCD this means that this LCD already uses the 

ROHS architecture implemented since 2006. The difference between versions is that we need to 

switch on a transistor (PortD pin 7) to power up the LCD module; this is embedded within the 

code.  

The position of the sample holder is known by creating a counter in each step the stepper motor 

does (as explained before on the working of the motor). 

To control and be able to move at various different sets speeds and ramps the sample holder it is 

used the RS232 standard connection with a computer that would then connect to a Visual-Basic 

application that would make the necessary calculations between the temperature and current 

position of the sample holder to create the ratio of speed or movement wanted on the stepper 

motor. 

Automatic control was the last step to be made because it needed all the other functions working. 

This function will allow the user to program a given set of instructions (Speed ratio and/or 

direction) without having to actually control the motor manually. In this step the connection 

between the microcontroller and the computer cannot be stopped. 

There are major differences embedded in the code between the two types of work (Speed ratio or 

direction). By using the first type, the control of the velocity is achieved by changing the delay 

between the steps which will influence directly the velocity the motor is running. The application 

on the computer would gather the information given by the thermocouple to determine either it 

should faster or slower, and then send the information to the microcontroller. The following code 

example will explain how this was achieved. 

Input= Getch();  // received information over Rs232 

RB1=1;      //  Enable stepper motor 

RB0=1;      //  Direction given to the stepper motor 

 for(i = 0; i = input;i++) 

{  

 RC0=1;      //  Stepper Clock 

 __delay_ms(1);     // 

 RC0=0;      // 

 __delay_ms(1);     //   StepperClock 

 Position_Counter= Position_Counter +1; //   Position Counter 

  

}       //  End For 

 



Temperature/Motion Feedback Loop for Fast Firing

By using the direction type of control, the speed would be at constant value but the direction 

would be changed according to the needs. The control would still be using the application on the 

computer to be able to identify either the motor should be moving clock wise or counter-clock-

wise. The movement would be controlled only by the type of ramp set by the user, meaning that 

when the temperature read by the thermocouple would surpass the indicated value the 

application would send an order to the control to move the sample backwards while the 

temperature is not below the value it should be at. This loop will continue until the allowed 

temperature increases, by then the motor will keep moving forward while the temperature does 

not surpass once again the set value. The following code example will explain how this was 

achieved. 

if (RE1 == 0){  

    

 if(RCIF) {         // Receive Data from rs232, use of interrupt 

  input= getch();   // read a response from the user 

  Dir=input-0x30;                            // Conversion from Ascii to Decimal numbers 

}  

      

  else 

  { 

  __delay_ms(1);  // Does not receive data from rs232, continues program 

  }   

  if (dir==2){ 

RB0=1;    //  Direction given to the stepper motor 

 

   RC0=1; 

   __delay_ms(5); 

   RC0=0; 

   __delay_ms(5); 

   Position_Counter= Position_Counter +1;    

  }    // End input ==2 

  if (dir==1){ 

RB0=0;    //  Direction given to the stepper motor 

   RC0=1; 

   __delay_ms(5); 

   RC0=0; 

   __delay_ms(5); 

   Position_Counter= Position_Counter -1; 

  }    // End input ==1 

             if (dir==3){ 

RB1=1;   //  Disable stepper motor 

  }    // End input ==3 

 }     // End RE1 Off 

The flowchart presented on the Figure 55 explains how the program works.

In the application the user is able to visualize the position and temperature at all times when 

connected to the microcontroller.

4.13.1   MANUAL CONTROL 

 

This mode allows the user to control the direction freely at a constant velocity. Although this 

mode is called Manual control, the microcontroller needs to be set up as automatic control since 

the control is still not been given directly by pushing buttons but by sending information over the

connection between the microcontroller and the computer. This mode work by sending a string 

telling the microcontroller in which direction it should move.

3- Display of the position and temperature 

4- Command Buttons 

5- Input Settings 

6- Information Display 

A visual aid was implemented on the representation of the furnace and sample holder for the 

user to help observe where the sample holder is in the furnace, since it will move accordingly to 

the position it is given by the microcontroller. Of course this feature will only work with this 

particular furnace or with one of a similar geometry. The stage of sintering indicator will indicate 

whether the sintering is still on the heating process, the soaking time inside of the furnace or if 

the sintering process is complete and the sample holder is returning to the point of origin. The 

command buttons allows the user to start the sintering process, stop it, view the graphical 

representation of the last experimental test and it can also save or not the test. The input setting 

allows the choosing of the heating ramp, the soak time and the desired temperature to be 

reached. The information display shows the time spent on the test, the temperature to be 

reached, and the maximum temperature selected by the user.

5 RESULTS 

Experimental tests were performed at different furnace temperatures and different heating rates. 

The method used in the experiments was, for any given constant motor velocity, to follow a 

sintering ramp with the closest possible fidelity. This was accomplished by changing the motor 

direction whenever it was required to increase or decreased the temperature. The graphics show 

the relationship obtained between the temperature and the time for any specific heating rate, 

represented in red. 

 

 

 

 

Figure 61- Graph obtained with a ramp of 100°C/min, at 100mm/min and the furnace set at 1000°C 

 

Figure 61, shows a reasonable agreement between sample temperature and desired ramp rate 

for a fast firing ramp rate of 100ºC/min. Nonetheless, one can observe fluctuations in 

temperature of the order of ±100ºC around the intended temperature values. These temperature 

fluctuations arise due to slow heating and cooling of the surrounding alumina sample support 

tube due to its low thermal conductivity. This is discussed further in the conclusions. Control is

also observed to be difficult at the lowest temperatures due to low temperature gradients at the 

mouth of the furnace and, thus, the greater influence of the ambient air temperature and drafts. 

This low temperature deviation is observed to be more severe at high ramp rates, Fig.63.

6 CONCLUSION 

 

The work accomplished in the scope of this thesis, had as the objective of the Conception of a 

system that allows the sintering of samples on any given tubular furnace, with different 

displacements, different gradients of temperatures and different working conditions. 

For the development of this work it was necessary to choose a set of equipment that allowed the 

fulfillment of the task at hand, the development of the programs and the methodology and to test 

and validate through experimental tests and analysis. 

One of the crucial aspects of the described project on this thesis was the selection of the method 

of control of the motor while reading/analyzing the temperature. Some constrains were cost, 

reliability of the results and the possibility of having a permanent and fast connection between 

the computer and the circuit.  

All of the selected components follow the above principle and are within the scale of work being it 

temperature level or speed of analysis and to highlight the possibility of having the possibility to 

also control the position manually and having an instant feedback, this fact also adds a new layer 

of security and use to this project. 

The control system developed contains an intrinsic error in the reading of the temperature of 0.25 

°C and this only represents and error off 0,02% to 0,025%  on the operative scale of the 

temperatures to be used on this particular work that goes from 1000 °C to 1200 °C (note that the 

temperature range can go from a minimum of 100ºC to a maximum of 1350 °C, with 100 °C being 

the lowest temperature to do a valid operation with the program and the 1350 °C the maximum 

temperature the IC max31855 can read). The monitoring of the temperature on manual setup is 

done in an interval of 500 milliseconds and while on operation of 1second to avoid any errors of 

communication between the microcontroller and the amplifier of the thermocouple.  

The results show that the starting point of the sintering process shows great discrepancies on the 

temperature values gathered, due to the already mentioned ambient temperature fluctuations 

which went from 15 °C to over 30 °C caused by drafts and in addition the low temperature 

gradient at the mouth of the furnace.  

The thermocouple cooling also affects in some degree the readings of the temperature. When the 

thermocouple is placed inside the alumina cylinder that carries the samples the value of the

temperature takes longer to decrease/increase because it depends directly on the ability of the 

alumina material to follow the heating/cooling process. For more accuracy a support material of 

higher thermal conductivity is, therefore, needed. 

 

By increasing the temperature over 600 °C the resolution required on the position is below 1 

millimeter, because the temperature changes much more quickly as the thermocouple starts to 

get near to the core of the furnace. 

The project, therefore, accomplished the objectives. However, fine tuning of the control is still 

needed with respect to motor speed and thermal conductivity of the support tube.. The operation 

can reach temperatures has high as 1350 °C, with sufficient speed to enable sintering rates from 

50ºC per minute to 150 °C per minute with a reliable response given the conditions of the 

experimental tests. The selected components proved to be appropriate to achieve the functional 

conditions desired. The circuit offers an acceptable level of precision and works with consistency 

with the Visual Basic application created for this work.

7 FUTURE WORKS 

Since the continuity of the work presented on this thesis possess a high interest, at this point are 

provided some suggestions and tasks to enhance the project. 

 

i) More tests at more specific rates of sintering to determine which control parameters 

are needed for which furnace temperatures and ramp rates. For example, additional 

parameters can be altered such as changes of backwards speed to attempt to 

compensate for the slow cooling of the support tube. With this improvement the 

relation Temperature/Time may possibly be improved. 

 

ii)  The addition of a second thermocouple that will move at the same time the 

thermocouple checking the temperature of the samples. This second thermocouple 

will be placed in front of the sample holder to read the temperature and store it the 

visual basic application. This will change how the program functions, because instead 

of relying on direction changes at a constant speed, it will work with variable speeds 

calculated with the displacement between the temperature taken by the second 

thermocouple and the sample holder one. 

The second thermocouple can be applied to the already made circuit, because this 

concept has been predicted for future works and the code to read two thermocouples 

simulatiously has already been implemented in the code. 

 

iii) The implementation of a Wifi or Bluetooth component to enable the working of this 

circuit without it needing to be near the either the circuit or the furnace. 

 

iv) If the same furnace is used for a long period of time it could also be create an array of 

data between the temperature/position to determine the exact velocity at any point 

of the motor to conduct a more reliable experimental test. This method was not 

implemented in this work, because the main idea was the ability to change the 

furnace that the sample is supposed to be sintered with, without the need to make 

additional changes to the code either in the microcontroller or in the Visual Basic 

application.
