COURSE BOOKS AS MENUS, NOT AS RECIPES:
TEACHING ENGLISH IN PRIMARY EDUCATION
ANA LOURENÇO
Abstract
KEYWORDS: course books, lesson planning, materials, English, young learners
This report aims to respond to my initial research question which was “What are the possibilities of using a course book as a menu?" and its main aim was to discover how it is possible to teach English in the 1st cycle in Portugal and accomplish the Metas Curriculares without always using the course book: in this case by designing a unit from scratch and creating original materials. This study took place from September 2016 to February 2017 in a 4th grade class in a primary school in Portugal. The results show that I was able to follow the Metas without the course book and enrich learning by including more student-centred and interactive activities. My study also shows that students may enjoy lessons designed by teachers from scratch more, although it is more time-consuming and does not always guarantee that every activity will be successful. During the research project there were significant differences felt from my perspective as a teacher and materials creator, which will also be approached.

Resumo
PALAVRAS-CHAVE: manuais, planificar aulas, materiais, Inglês, jovens aprendentes
Este relatório pretende responder à minha questão inicial, nomeadamente “Quais são as possibilidades de usar um manual como um menu?" e o objetivo principal é descobrir como é possível lecionar Inglês no 1° Ciclo em Portugal e cumprir os objetivos das Metas Curriculares sem se ter de recorrer sempre ao manual: neste caso criando uma unidade de raiz e materiais originais Este estudo realizou-se entre setembro de 2016 e fevereiro de 2017 numa turma de 4° ano numa escola do 1° ciclo em Portugal. Os resultados demonstram que consegui atingir as Metas sem o manual e enriquecer as aprendizagens ao incluir atividades mais interativas e mais centradas nos alunos. O meu estudo revela também que os alunos poderão gostar mais das aulas criadas de raiz pelos próprios professores, apesar de exigir muito mais tempo e de nem sempre garantir que todas as atividades sejam bem sucedidas. Durante este projeto de investigação foram sentidas diferenças significativas na minha perspectiva de professora e criadora de materiais que irão também ser abordadas.

Chapter 1: Introduction
From a general perspective, course books are undoubtedly an important tool “written by a group of experts and they constitute a great part of the materials used in the classroom language” (Ek§i, 2010: 323), which to a certain extent releases teachers from creating materials from scratch.
As a student, I can easily recall that my whole school life was based on learning from my teachers that accompanied the course book contents and that was never an issue for me. It was just the norm. When I started working as an English teacher in the Atividades de Enriquecimento Curricular (AEC) in the 1st cycle a few years ago I found it awkward having to teach without a course book, but I soon discovered that there were many alternatives and resources available to help me plan my lessons, especially on the Internet. With the help of my colleagues I learned that it was indeed possible to teach English to young learners without resorting to a course book and having lots of fun at the same time.
So,	when I began my practicum (PES I in 2016) it was the first time I had ever worked with a course book as a teacher and I felt under pressure to complete it to ensure that the Metas Curriculares (MC) were accomplished. At the same time, I was also under the impression that many teachers opted to follow the course book instructions very rigidly in order to finish it completely by the end of the school year. This insight was due to a large number of comments I read (made by the teachers themselves) on social media but also heard during conversations among some colleagues, not only from English in the 1st cycle but from other subjects. By following the course book during my practicum, I knew I would not have much of an opportunity to try different activities, which I knew were more suitable.
For this reason, I wanted to know if I could ensure MC would be accomplished without following the course book. After reading about my interest and reflecting on how to conduct my research, and instead of opting to adapt and substitute activities from the course book, I decided instead to design a whole unit as soon as I knew the course book I was going to work with and with a view to finding out how to use a course book “as a menu from which you choose, rather than a recipe which you follow rigidly” (Brewster, Ellis &amp;amp; Girard, 2002: 231).
Chapter 2: Literature review
The question around the usefulness of English Language Teaching (ELT) course books is not recent. Few authors seem to defend it as the only teacher resource in the classroom and the majority appear to agree that teaching solely based on the course book can never be enough to meet both L2 teachers' and students' needs. However, in many countries around the world, schools' adoption of course books, from pre-primary school to university, is a reality and regarding the development of alternative materials and strategies by the teacher, the fact is that millions of course books are still acquired each year. Nevertheless, the arguments for and against do not seem to vary greatly.
In this chapter, I will discuss the role of the course book in the classroom and how it interferes with the teachers' and learners' roles, showing the pros and cons of following a course book and presenting ideas to develop new materials.
2.1	- Pros and cons of using course books
2.1.1	- The pros of using course books
O'Neill (1982: 106-107) reports his own experience as an English teacher to expose his arguments for the use of course books, namely that: many of them are suitable for almost all needs because “there is often a common core of needs shared by a variety of groups in different places studying under different conditions at different times”; they allow students to look back on what they have done and to look forward to what is coming since “the books made it possible for learners who, for various reasons, had missed lessons to catch up”; they provide ready-made materials which could cost lots of time and money to replace by others, so “Books are good value for money”; and finally that they should leave space for teachers to adapt and improvise and that is why “it is important that textbooks should be so designed and organized that a great deal of improvisation and adaptation by both teacher and class is possible” (p. 107). Similarly, he adds that not using a course book prevents learners “from making the fullest possible use of their resources for staying in touch with the language” and that the learner does not have the chance “to look ahead to future lessons and spend time preparing oneself for them”. The author also considers that home-made materials “tend to get shabby very quickly” and that asking for photocopies is sometimes restrictive in some places and costs more, besides the fact
that sheets are more likely to get lost and that books are easier to carry and to read everywhere.
In addition, Hutchinson and Torres (1994) propose that a good dynamic interaction in a lesson can only be achieved considering three main elements: the teacher, the materials and the students (figure 1), in order to “provide the structure and predictability” (p. 323) that only a course book can offer.
Figure 1 - A model of the lesson (Hutchinson &amp;amp; Torres, 1994: 318)
Hutchinson and Torres believe that course books offer complete guidance for lessons, considering of course that there may be different interpretations from teacher to teacher, since each one has their own convictions and preferences. They also stress the importance of a very well-structured lesson, arguing that a clear lesson has “phases clearly marked and signposted, regularly scheduled events, and clear and fair turn allocation for student participation” (p. 319) and that, again, a course book provides what is needed for this to be successfully achieved. Last but not least, Hutchinson and Torres focus on the importance of the teacher's role, acknowledging that they may benefit from “the security that a clear structure provides” (p. 325), so the more secure they feel about the script provided by the course books, the more willing they are to free themselves from that script. In this sense, the course book can be an important tool and seems to help develop teachers' potential to be creative. Hence, it is suggested that there should be room for more seminars and workshops for the teachers to be more familiarized with the course books and for the publishers to know more about teachers' needs (p. 327).
Finally, for teachers to make sure they make a good choice while analysing course books, Ek§i (2010) suggests a checklist grid because, according to the author,
the appraisal of a course book “provides a greater perception of the book's strengths and weaknesses, which enables the teacher to focus on the weak points and adapt or supplement them accordingly” (p. 329).
2.1.2	- The cons of using course books
Swan (1992), on the other hand, highlights the fact that course books are dangerous in the way that they release teachers from responsibility, justifying that “it is easy to just sit back and operate the system, secure in the belief that the wise and virtuous people who produced the textbook knew what was good for us” (p. 2). Jordan (2016) subscribes and considers that contents and methodologies are already predetermined and imposed by the course book, which assume that teachers will follow its order and succession of activities, depriving them and the students from owning the learning process.
2.2	- Supplementing course books
A course book will be written for a particular market, global or local, and by nature are 'one size fits all' - regardless of the social, geographical and educational context of use (Stranks, 2012: 125). They should be flexible, and for that reason “the language teacher has to be a 'materials developer' in the sense that s/he needs to be able to select, evaluate, adapt and produce materials to ensure a match between the given students and the materials they use” (Ek§i, 2010: 323). It is extremely important to ensure that the pupils' needs are met, because in a single class there are children with different levels of English and socio-cultural backgrounds as well as different learning styles and preferences. Similarly, Halliwell (1992) corroborates this with the idea of supplementing when, in spite of presenting advantages of the course book both for teachers and for learners, she concludes that “there are several things that the teacher can often do better than a book” (p. 114), that is to say:
-	providing the spoken word in spoken exchanges;
-	adjusting work in response to the reactions of the children;
-	using communication other than words and pictures to back up language elements;
-	setting up learning activities which encourage learners to talk and profit from interaction (Halliwell, 1992: 114).
So, it seems very clear that working only with the course book is not enough and that teachers have much more to add to enhance their English lessons.
2.3	- Teachers creating materials
Moon (2000) suggests that what leads teachers to create their own materials depends on factors such as the amount of freedom, time, interest and experience. Hence the causes include: lack of time, the cost involved, lack of handbooks or reference books to get ideas from and lack of skills/expertise. Her suggestions for overcoming those difficulties include: exchanging materials with other teachers or investing a little step by step (e.g. laminated materials last longer), to have confidence to try out new things and subscribing to some teachers' magazines.
Brewster, Ellis &amp;amp; Girard (2002) put the children's needs above all as the most important factor to take into consideration when it comes to reaching a balance between the language aims of the syllabus and the pupils' needs. In terms of variety, the authors suggest preferably authentic stories, videos and games in order to captivate the students and to keep them motivated and interested in learning.
Graves (2003) also proposes getting to know the course book and to see how to select, adapt, reject or supplement (SARS). The author suggests analysing it first (maybe just a unit for the beginning) to check what we like or don't like, and if we would emphasize, supplement or even reject something; to personalize, or in other words, to make other materials more relevant and meaningful for the students; and to use props, visuals or realia.
Last but not least, Ek§i (2010) emphasizes a different approach to be considered when planning authentic materials' activities for young learners, namely considering their purpose, their difficulty, their relevance and interest, the quality of the materials, if they are practical and their cultural appropriateness.
2.4	- Literature review summary
Summing up, a course book is undeniably an important tool both for teachers and students. However, there seems to be common sense in suggesting that teachers need to take into consideration their students' needs and take risks, developing new ideas, which does not necessarily mean following what is suggested in the course book. Creating new materials leads teachers to develop their creativity, to take risks and consequently to learn and understand what works best and what does not.
This report aims to find out more about the teacher's performance when teaching based on the course book and without it, considering the pros and cons previously presented and hoping to find answers to the following research questions:
1.	What are the possibilities of using a course book as a menu?
2.	What differs between teaching solely based on the course book and teaching without the course book?
Chapter 3: The Action Research
3.1	- Context
The school where I did my teaching practice is in the district of Lisbon. In this area, a middle-low social status prevails, a large part of the population is aging and there is a high number of immigrants, turning this parish into a multicultural centre (unpublished school documentation).
In the school year 2016/2017, about 355 students attended the school, distributed over 15 classes: one pre-school class and 14 first cycle classes. About 55% of the students benefitted from economic aid from the school's social action services (SASE). In addition, the school offers Atividades de Enriquecimento Curricular (AEC) -English, Music and Physical Education - and provides an extended schedule, assured by Componente de Apoio à Família and Atividades de Animação e Apoio à Família.
The class group I worked with was a 4th grade group of 19 students: eight girls and 11 boys, aged between 9 and 10 years old. One of the students had special educational needs and I did not have permission to include him in my study. He attended very few lessons and did very little in relation to English.
Generally speaking, their average English level was good according to the placement test marks (average of 74%) and they were always enthusiastic during the lessons and very eager to learn. It is important to say that they had had English since the 1st grade in the AEC and there were a few students who stood out in terms of acquisition (vocabulary and structures) from the previous years; they were quite fast acquiring new contents and always tried to express themselves in English. There were others, three in particular, who were constantly interrupting and whose attention span was low. After speaking with their mainstream teacher, I came to know that their difficulties were not restricted to the English lessons.
As in all of the 4th grade groups in this school cluster, there were two English lessons per week, of 60 minutes each. In this class, the lessons were on Wednesdays at 2 o'clock and on Thursdays at 3 o'clock. The course book was New Treetops 4 (Oxford University Press) and in the previous year it had been New Treetops 3. I soon found out that the students not only enjoyed this course book, but also felt a great connection to its characters.
3.2	- Methodology
After carefully choosing my area of interest and then researching the literature, I developed my action research project. I followed the four stages of action research: planning, action, observation and reflection (Burns, 2010: 8).
Initially, my practicum was expected to take place from September to December 2016, but for health reasons I was unable to work from November to December 2016. I returned to the second part of my study in January 2017 and concluded it in February 2017. For better understanding, the diagram below (figure 2) shows the stages I went through, including the tools I used (which will be explained next):
Stages
Figure 2 - My practicum stages
3.2.1	- Informed consent
Before starting my practicum, I had to ask for informed consent to the school, parents and children. I handed in a formal letter to the school's director (see appendix
1), another one to the parents at the first meeting of the school year (see appendix 2) and then a more informal letter to the children in the first lesson (see appendix 3). This was done after carefully explaining the purpose of my study and making clear that they were not forced to accept and that they could change their minds at any time during the study.
In the end, only one out of 19 parents did not give permission and the 18 children who were allowed all agreed to participate.
3.2.2	- Tools
For my study I chose both qualitative and quantitative tools to help me to collect data. As I had to plan and design a unit, I started by evaluating the course book according to the grid (see appendix 4) provided by Ek§i (2010: 338), which works as a checklist “to evaluate course books so as to find the best of its kind available for the intended use”. This grid analyses the physical format of the course book, the content, vocabulary and structures, graphic elements, the teacher's book, other supplementary materials and pedagogical issues. This was done at the beginning of the school year.
Since my area of study is about the use of course books in the classroom, I prepared questionnaires to hand in after a unit taught exclusively based on the course book (see appendix 5) and another one to apply after a unit planned and designed by me without following the course book (see appendix 6), so that I could have students' opinion about learning and working with the course book and without it.
In order to collect data to help me provide progress notes on the class, during the lessons I took notes using an observation grid, which considered skills, attitudes and motivation. The results helped me compare if there were any differences in participation, motivation and acquisition of the contents taught in those two moments. In addition, to keep a record of my own thoughts, I kept a teaching journal, written after the lessons, about my personal perceptions. The results helped mostly to identify in which part of my study students were more motivated and engaged according to each type of activity, but also to analyse my own feelings during the two moments of my study.
3.3	- Results and discussion
This section describes the results of the tools of each stage of my practicum, accompanied by the analysis and discussion of the data I collected. To make this analysis and discussion more meaningful and understandable, I will include the observations I collected during the lessons and my teaching journal reflections. I will also add some excerpts of my weekly reflections to my supervisor during PES II whenever I feel it is useful to support my points of view felt during the practicum.
3.3.1	- Research questions
Before I started my practicum, my initial research question was “What are the possibilities of using a course book as a menu?”. My main aim was to discover more options to teach the contents foreseen by the MC without having to rigidly follow the instructions suggested by the course book, whether in terms of units, skills or the sequence of activities. With the course book I was going to use I had a good opportunity to insert a topic from the MC from scratch because it was not included. Besides, I was used to creating my own materials and I was curious about how to do it. So, this was a great opportunity to apply my prior knowledge and at the same time I would practice and learn more about how to plan a unit based on a topic, which was something I only started learning properly during the MA. I decided that in the first stage I would teach a unit based on the course book, following the 'script' suggested in the Teacher's Book guide and after that I would design my own unit from scratch and teach with my own materials. While planning my own unit, I had to guarantee that the MC were accomplished and at the same time I could not alter the school's year plan which had already been established and approved.
During my practicum, another question emerged: “What differs between teaching solely based on the course book and teaching without the course book?”. This issue arose because while preparing the lessons I felt there were significant differences for me as a teacher and there were also differences in my students when comparing their performance and attitudes in my lessons with and without the course book.
3.3.2	- Course book analysis (Stage 1)
As previously mentioned, I used Ek§i's checklist grid (see appendix 4) to know more about the course book I was going to use, although the real intent of the grid is to use it while analysing course books to compare with others and to select one later. Still, it helped me to analyse the first units in New Treetops 4 and to have my own perception of it.
Overall, my impression of the course book was quite good. It is clearly written for a global audience and it is very short when compared to the majority of the other course books for this grade. At the same time, the grid presented me with a lot of
other criteria that I had not thought about before, such as the usefulness of the Teacher's Book guidance or if the contents were up-to-date and thus meaningful for the students. Among others, I considered as the most positive aspects: the physical format and the graphic elements (very appealing), the topics and their meaningfulness (vocabulary and grammar), the characters, stories and songs and chants and the adaptability of the course book's contents and activities.
Regarding the negative aspects, I considered the poor representation of other countries or cultures; the variety and pace of the activities and materials and the increasing of complexity in the activities. These last two I scored low but I do not see them as negative aspects: the fact that the course book does not have a huge variety of activities and materials makes it consistent, and I consider that the level of complexity does not increase much, which means, in my point of view, that they are appropriate for the students, although for the best students they may not be challenging enough. Considering the materials that come with the course book, they were generally appropriate, but some of the flashcards had overly small images that the students could not visualize well. Last but not least, while analysing the course book I became aware that some 4th grade contents of the MC were not included, namely 'places at school', 'body parts', 'the five senses' and 'rooms in the house'. The last one would be the topic I would chose to introduce together with furniture.
3.3.3	- Working with the course book (Stage 2)
This took place in the second stage of my practicum, from September to October 2016. Here I started teaching solely based on the course book and followed only the teacher's book guidelines at the beginning of the school year.
In the first place I will explain the process of planning according to the course book; secondly, I will give one example of an activity that went well and another one that did not go so well, supporting that data with evidence given by my observation grids, my teaching notes and questionnaire 1; then I will add my feelings and thoughts about working with the course book, laying out what I considered positive and negative for me as a teacher-trainee, taking into account what I had researched for my literature review.
3.3.3.1	- Planning: the process
Together with my co-operating teacher, it was decided that I would start from the beginning of the course book, so I taught pages 4 to 11 from New Treetops 4, which corresponded to an introductory unit - Autumn, pp. 4-5 - and to unit 1 - In the Town, pp. 6-11. Overall, I taught six lessons based on the course book. Thus, I prepared the lessons solely based on the New Treetops 4 - Teacher's Book (pp. 13-19), excluding activities from the Activity Book, because the students did not have it.
So, for each lesson I prepared my lesson plan with both the course book and teacher's book in front of me. After carefully reading what was supposed to be done in that lesson, I had to interiorize it and basically the very act of planning consisted of copying the stages suggested in the teacher's book to my own lesson plan outline. I assume here that I understood the meaning of operating the system that absolves teachers from responsibility mentioned by Swan (1994), because in fact I did not have to think much about what I was going to do - everything was there - except to memorize what to teach, in the order the course book gave it to me.
My experience of planning following the teacher's book guidelines gave me the insight that it is a somewhat easier and time-saving task when comparing it to planning on my own because the hard work was done, and by hard work I mean the process of thinking about the topic, the aims for the unit, thinking about activities or tasks, planning each session, the aims for each lesson, the skills to explore in each lesson, how to access them etc., which was what I had to do later when planning all by myself. In this sense I must agree that the course book “is the best means of providing the structure” (Hutchinson and Torres, 1994: 321).
I	would also want to make clear that even with my intention of following exclusively the teacher's book guidelines, it was not always possible and it needed adaptations. For example, it contains activities from the Activity Book that the students did not have, so I never did those activities, although it was a very good resource for them to practise and consolidate contents. Regarding the flashcards, they are an extremely useful tool for classes, but I could not count on them for most of these lessons, because they were very small and students could not understand the images
from a short distance. For this reason, I used the teacher's flash drive and projected the course book's pages on the board and I did not use flashcards for this unit.
3.3.3.2	- A successful activity
This activity took place on 12th October 2016 and the aim of that lesson was to introduce a new topic in Unit 1 - In the Town. As it is described in the lesson plan (see appendix 7), it actually consisted of a sequence of three activities in one: listen and point, repeat and then number. As this was a vocabulary introduction lesson, the objectives were to say and identify places in a town.
Initially, the students had to look at an image of a town and identify places (they could use L1 in this stage). After that I introduced the new words related to places in town. Students had to follow by pointing to the numbered places in the image and repeating the words I said. This was done two or three times.

Then, I played the audio and the learners had to listen to the words and point to the correct image. There were three sequences of repetitions, each one with a different order. After that, they had to listen and repeat the words. Finally, we all read the words in the box aloud and they were able to write the number of each place in the correct word in the box.
Taking into consideration the Encounter, Engage and Exploit model (Dias &amp;amp; Mourão, 2005), this sequence of activities was inserted in the Encounter stage. Even though this was not very mentally engaging (Halliwell, 1992), I considered this very simple but very successful for the students, because of what I could be aware of during the lesson, namely their interest and their behaviour. I remember an interesting observation from student K referring to the word 'café7: “Teacher, há um erro no livro. Em inglês não há acentos" (my journal, 12/10/2016). I immediately praised her for being so attentive and said that she was right, but that there were exceptions just like in many other languages, so I explained that the word 'café' had a French origin but it is used in English to mean the place where people can go to drink coffee. Another curious remark was from student A, who noted that “Library é livraria" (my journal, 12/10/2016). I commended his observation very much, because he was one of the students with more difficulties. Then I explained that sometimes there are words in English similar to Portuguese ones, but with different meanings. In this case, 'a library' is where we can go to read or request books, and that livraria in English is a bookshop. For me, these two examples were an evidence that the students were engaged in learning the new lexical items and curious about the nature of those lexical items, expressing curiosity and their ability to notice and compare new words.
As the students were listening to the words to point to in their course books, I walked around the classroom and observed that they were indeed dedicated to the activity. One of the difficulties, however, was to make sure that everyone was pointing to the correct image. The tendency (at least mine) was to monitor the weaker students, but I made sure I also checked the stronger ones. They enjoyed the activity as they asked me to put the track on one more time.
The overall behaviour in this lesson was also very good, considering a previous one that did not go so well. As this was the first lesson introducing a new topic, I may assume that the students feel more motivated and committed when they start learning new content never taught before and that they understand the importance of paying attention from the start.
3.3.3.3	- An unsuccessful activity
Figure 4 - New Treetops 4, pages 4-5
I	do not think that any of the activities suggested by the course book went wrong. However, it was the students' restlessness during this lesson, and more specifically during this activity, that made me think that things did not go as I expected. Unbeknown to me, it had been an outdoor activity day and consequently the students were overexcited and it was hard to take full control of the lesson.
As the teacher's book was not totally clear about whether it was an individual or pair-work activity, I thought that doing this in pairs would be a better idea, because the words expected from the students were related to the 3 grade course book and I supposed they might remember the words, but that they would not know how to write them. Apparently, in this case, and as they were restless, it would have been a better idea to change plans during the lesson and make them work individually to settle them down. Even while explaining the activity, some students were not paying attention and were looking at different pages, doing exercises on their own. It was not a successful activity because of their restlessness combined with it being the first time they were
actually writing in their course book. It would have worked better if I had known that they were having a day full of outdoor activities and prepared a different kind of lesson. Instead I opted to stick to my plan, which was following the course book; however, I should had been able to improvise and do something different to suit their mood.
3.3.3.4	- My feelings and thoughts
Teaching according to what was already planned was always something that put me under a great deal of pressure: when following something already done we need to make sure we do not skip steps, otherwise an activity or even a lesson may fall apart. Due to that insecurity, “I had to take topics with me. I feel silly but not comfortable without it. I'm afraid I can forget some step and then I ruin it all” (my journal 13/10/2016).
I would also like to add that it was unfortunate that the students did not have access to the Activity Book. It works as an extremely useful resource to supplement the course book, whether to work on during the lessons or for the students to practise at home and consolidate their learning. As the course has been created around both books, I believe the students would have benefited from having the Activity Book. Nevertheless, these lessons went really well most of the time regarding the objectives planned for each lesson, completing most of the activities, the students' response and their motivation. I only had some behaviour management issues in the first lessons which I overcame by introducing a behaviour managing strategy, not part of the course book.
3.3.4	- Questionnaire 1 (Stage 2)
I gave the children questionnaire 1 after finishing the first unit “Places in Town” in October 2016 (see appendix 5). The following results show the 18 students' opinions about their course books and it consisted of three questions:
1.	Gostas de usar o manual de Inglês? (Pinta uma carinha)/ Do you like to use your English course book? (Colour one face)
2.	De que é que mais gostas no teu manual? (Pinta só três carinhas)/ What do you like most in your English course book? (Colour only three faces)
3.	Como é que te sentes quando não precisas de usar o manual numa aula? (Pinta uma carinha)/ How do you feel when you don't have to use the course book in a lesson? (Colour one face).
Gostas de usar o manual de Inglês?
12	------H-
Muito	Bastante	Pouco	Nada
Figure 5 - Questionnaire 1 - Q1: “Gostas de usar o manual de Inglês?'
To the question “Do you like to use your English course book?” it is clear that the majority of students enjoyed using the course book as 16 out of 18 indicated they liked it 'very much'. This was clear since the beginning of September when they had to start using the course book and they were extremely excited about it, leafing through it to explore the new contents. It is also the case in their other subjects. My final thought was that these results were a little frightening since the next stage would be to work without the course book, so the lessons and the contents had to be interesting and challenging enough to grab their attention so as not to let them miss the course book.
Figure 6 - Questionnaire 1 - Q2: "De que e que mais gostas no teu manual?'
Concerning the question "What do you like most in your English course book?” the three most voted for were: the stories (14 votes), the characters (12 votes) and the songs (nine votes). The images had five votes and the written and listening exercises both had seven votes. In my opinion, these results show that the students do relate to this course book's characters and their adventures in the stories: "Stories help young children to develop concentration skills and also aspects of emotional intelligence,
such as empathy and relating to other people” (Read, 2007: 114). I can also infer that the course book's songs also have an important impact on the students' preferences because they “allow for both verbal and non-verbal participation through physical movement, actions drama and play” (ibid, p. 182). These preferences match with my own opinion while assessing the course book for the first time (see appendix 4), where I also thought that, overall, it was a very appealing course book in that sense. I think it is also clear that the students do not give such great importance to the written and listening exercises as complementing exercises and although the images were the least voted, they are what makes the stories and the characters so interesting for them.
My final thought on this was that for my next stage where I had to design my own unit, I had to definitely think about a story, a song and keeping the characters.
Figure 7 - Questionnaire 1 - Q3: “Como é que te sentes quando não precisas de usar o manual numa aula?”
To the final question “How do you feel when you don't use your English course book”, seven students considered they felt happy, another seven felt indifferent and four admitted they felt angry. In theory then, not using the course book during the lesson should not be a problem for most them, but I wondered if the students truly understood the question, because the vast majority had indicated they loved working with the course book.
3.3.5	- Working without the course book (Stage 3)
This took place in the third stage of my practicum, from January to February 2017. Here I had to discuss my idea with my co-operating teacher so that I did not diverge much from the school cluster's planning. It was established that I could teach the topic I had chosen and that I would assess the students informally during the lessons, but it would not be assessed formally in the test at the end of the term.
In the following section I explain how I chose my topic, the process of planning and the materials I created. I will give one example of an activity that went well and another one that did not go so well and I will describe my feelings and thoughts about working without the course book. Finally, I will analyse the responses from questionnaire 2.
3.3.5.1	- Choosing the topic
I had to take into consideration the previous content taught by my co-operating teacher - Healthy eating - and the following one - My bedroom furniture, so I compared the units offered by the course book with what was required by the MC for the 4th grade. Rooms in the house (Lexis and Grammar, 4. 4. Identificar vocabulário relacionado com os espaços à nossa volta - Divisões da casa) was not represented in this level, but it was in the course book from the 3 grade. As I could not make sure that that content had been taught previously and as it was related to the following topic 'My bedroom furniture', I planned to introduce rooms in the house.
Since my biggest concerns were the song and the story (the most voted for in Questionnaire 1), I chose the song Topsy-turvy house1, which would fit in perfectly in my topic, because it is about furniture placed in strange rooms in the house (e.g: “A bath in the dining room”). Concerning the story, I opted to use the New Treetops 4 story as it refers to the contents I would teach (rooms in the house and furniture); it keeps the characters the students loved so much and it also introduces the prepositions of place. The song became the starting point for me to articulate my lessons: starting with rooms in the house, then moving on to furniture and finally to prepositions of place.
3.3.5.2	- Planning: the process
After choosing the topic, I had to start planning my unit. I had to take into account the seven skills (Intercultural Domain, Lexis and Grammar, Listening, Spoken Interaction, Spoken Production, Reading and Writing) and think about what I wanted
1
Topsy turvy house from: Canções em Ingles: pre-escolar e 1° ciclo. Divisão Educaçao, 2001 Camara Municipal de Leiria (Arranjos musicais Joaquim Branco; vozes Sandie Mourão &amp;amp; Ines Marques; adaptado de Lobo M. J. &amp;amp; P. Subirà, 1993 Heinemann)
to develop in the lessons. So, I opted to start with the rooms in the house, then move
to different items of furniture and finally introduce some prepositions of place.
My unit plan (see figure 7) describes the aims I set up for each skill, what I wanted to focus on for each skill and the respective activities, assessment tools and materials.

Figure 8 - My unit plan
Planning a unit like this based on my own ideas was not an easy task for me. It requires ability and a knowledge that I had not yet developed, despite teaching in the AEC for a few years, so I found it very hard to put in practice. Besides, it took me a lot of time. I had to look at the course book's planning and other course books as well to see how it was done and adapt these to suit my students' needs. I also had to make it as clear as possible to work with it as my support-base to further plan lesson after lesson. In the end, I think I was able to put in practice most of the activities that I had planned, despite the fact that from lesson to lesson I had to adapt some things here
and there due mostly to time constraints and to ensure that I would accomplish what I had planned.
Overall, it was very stressful, especially thinking about how to link everything together in order to have a coherent sequence and not forgetting to cover all the skills. Besides, it was not only about designing the unit and planning: it demanded creating my own materials.
Concerning the lesson plans I wrote twice a week, I must say that this was where I learned the most. Again, it took far longer compared to planning with the course book. There is a huge difference between just thinking about what we are going to teach and actually sitting down and dedicating time to think about the aims for the lesson and what we want from the students for each activity.
3.3.5.3	- Materials
Concerning the materials for my unit, I used both teacher resources and selfmade materials, which were created to look professional and to last longer. The following table (figure 8) lists the materials and for which part of my unit I used them.
House		Furniture
Teacher resources	Self-made resources	Self-made resources

Figure 9 - List of materials
As can be seen in appendix 9, what was handmade I did with cardboard and markers and the rest I did on the computer, using the Paint programme to cut and edit images searched online and the Word programme to create the worksheets, flashcards and mini cards, the puzzle game and the true or false exercise.
The materials I used were cardboard, colourful sheets of paper and markers and it involved a printer and print cartridges. I cannot say exactly how much time I spent on each item of material, but I easily spent one to three hours on each one.
It gave me immense pleasure to create my own materials and be able to use some from magazines, something I had already done with other topics while teaching in the AEC. In my experience, and as previously discussed in the Literature Review chapter, it is undeniable, however, that: it requires a lot of time choosing images, formatting them, printing, cutting, laminating and cutting again if necessary; and it requires spending some money (cartridges, cardboard, colourful sheets, laminating sheets...). Nevertheless, it was time and money spent that provided me with materials for the rest of my professional life as a teacher and the students seemed to enjoy my choices: “Onde é que arranjas coisas tão giras, teacher?”, by student S (my journal, 9/02/2017).
3.3.5.4	- A successful activity
This activity started on the 9th February and finished on the 15th February 2017 and its aim was to have students working in groups of four or five students to create their own version of the song Topsy-turvy house (see appendix 12) and then perform it in front of the class as an oral presentation. Having the vocabulary (rooms and furniture) previously introduced and consolidated, I introduced the song and played it several times until the children were confident about the lexical set and the melody.
I split the class into groups of four and five students and, together, they had to write new lyrics for the song. They could include any rooms, furniture or animals they wanted to. After deciding it, they had to write the lyrics on the notebooks or on a sheet of paper and draw and colour the correspondent topsy-turvy house in a house outline I gave them. Finally, and as homework, they had until the following week to practise the song in groups in order to present their poster and sing their song in the next lesson.
I felt from the very beginning that this activity was going to be a success. When I first introduced the song one or two lessons before, they found it very funny because of its nonsense and absurdity and they easily let themselves flow in the jingle the song
offers. So, when I told them they would have to work in groups and make their own song, “They definitely were surprised and excited about the group work and most of the groups made an effort to express themselves in English” (PES II reflection, week 4). Proof of that was when student E reprehended a colleague because he suggested a normal description, when it was supposed to be weird descriptions: “A wardrobe in the bedroom, N? Really, N?” (my journal, 9/02/2017). Later I found out from the mainstream teacher that the children “had spent the whole week singing Topsy-turvy house, they used time-breaks to gather in groups to conclude their projects and rehearse and were even critical about each other's roles during the work” (PES II reflection, week 5). Their presentations were amazing: they showed commitment and took it seriously; the pronunciation and accuracy was generally very good and they were very creative. There was a group that decided to use completely different animals to place in the furniture, including a dolphin and a mole, which was something that would never have crossed my mind (see figure 8).
Figure 10 - Group work sample
Another thing I would like to emphasize is that it is indeed extremely important to have students working in groups, which is something that grants them ownership: “Students feel important, 'adult-like', responsible, they want to impress the teachers, their colleagues but also themselves. This can only bring positive things and amazing
results.” (PES II reflection, week 5). Also, as Hillyard (2013) explains concerning the use of songs, "we face the challenge of turning repetition into something meaningful and fun”. Considering her sequence of before (exposure), during (production) and after (expansion) activities, with this task the students easily moved into the expansion stage, "turning the repetition [of the song] into something meaningful and fun” (p. 19), giving them ownership.
3.3.5.5	- An unsuccessful activity
This activity took place on 2nd February 2017 during my observed lesson with my supervisor and the aim was to have students working in pairs playing a puzzle game (see figure 9) with images of the furniture items and asking and answering questions (see appendix 15).
Figure 11 - Puzzle game
The objectives for this game were to apply and consolidate previously learned vocabulary and to promote speaking skills by practising question/answer. The students worked in pairs and together they had to join the pieces of seven furniture images to complete seven complete puzzles. After that, they had to choose and point to a puzzle and ask each other "What is it?” and the other had to answer "It's a ...”.
My intention was to provide an enjoyable activity while making a puzzle and interacting with each other in L2, practising what they had been learning. While planning at home before the lesson, I joined the pieces of the seven images together and I estimated approximately that the students would need 12 to 15 minutes to complete the puzzles and ask and answer questions with each other.
In fact, what happened was that three or four pairs finished the puzzles and the question/answer in less than 5 minutes and others did not finish the seven puzzles until the end of the lesson. My supervisor gave me the following feedback:
You set up the pair work activity nicely, dividing the cc into pairs using AB, but unfortunately once the puzzle activity began, the lesson fell apart. Children were left for long periods of time with nothing to do and it could have been a recipe for chaos, although they were very well behaved really! There was huge potential for this activity and I would have liked to see the cc making the sentences as a follow up, which was also a nice idea (Supervisor's feedback, 2nd February 2017).
This was exactly what happened and at that time I was so obsessed with taking observation notes on each pair asking and answering that I did not notice that others were already bored and without anything to do. I had planned a follow up activity, which was to build sentences to label each puzzle - I had set an envelope for each pair with all the words mixed, so for those who had finished so fast I should had given them this second activity. I did not do it because when I realized it the lesson was about to finish in five minutes.
So, after the lesson and during the meeting with my supervisor, here are the conclusions we discussed concerning this activity (taken from this lesson's feedback):
1.	The puzzle activity did not provide reasons to speak English by itself, so the students just divided the pieces and completed each one by themselves and said nothing or just spoke L1.
2.	The puzzles were too difficult and prompted students to speak in L1.
3.	The speaking activity was not an information gap activity, because asking and answering about seven images that can be seen by both students leaves no real reason to ask the question.
4.	The fact that I was collecting observation notes from each and every pair prolonged the activity, which led a lot of students with nothing to do for more than 10 minutes.
As an alternative to this activity, a mini-cards memory game or a guessing game in pairs would have worked better and speaking skills would have been incorporated in a more meaningful way.
From this activity I learned that even when we want to create an enjoyable learning environment and give students the opportunity to play a different game, we must always think about the level of meaningfulness and challenge and never forget that the main purpose must always be to use L2. This activity clearly did not demand much use of English and gave opportunities to speak L1, which was something that I had not predicted.
3.3.5.6	- My feelings and thoughts
When comparing both stages - using the course book and not using the course book - I definitely felt a greater freedom and much more self-confidence in the classroom while teaching the lessons I had designed. When teaching my own lessons without the course book I did not worry about skipping steps as I did while following the course book planning: when I planned, I idealized things from scratch and the ideas - whether they were good or bad choices - were mine, so I knew them by heart.
I also think I was able to create a pleasant environment in the classroom most of the time and the insight that I have is that the students had a lot more fun with the lessons I designed than those based on the course book. The biggest evidence of that is in a lovely notebook that the class offered me in the end of the practicum and where they mention, among other things, that: “Foi muito divertido este tempo de aulas. Aprendemos muitas coisas na brincadeira” (student C); "[...] e que volte para nos dar mais aulas e podermos fazer mais jogos divertidos” (student O); “Nunca mais irei ter uma te[a]cher tão divertida e brincalhona” (student L).
However, this does not mean that everything went perfectly well: in fact, there were more flaws in the lessons I designed than with those I taught based on the course book. I believe I was being too ambitious, I should have dedicated more time to some of the activity set-up stages and their aims and probably that was why some activities were not challenging enough for my group of students.
3.3.6	- Questionnaire 2 (stage 3)
I applied this questionnaire when I finished my practicum. This shows the responses of the 18 students on the lessons without using the course book and the questions were:
1.	Gostaste das aulas sem teres de usar o manual de Inglês? (Pinta uma carinha)/ Did you like English without the course book? (Colour one face)
2.	De que é que mais gostaste nesta aulas? (Pinta só quatro carinhas)/ What did you like most in these lessons? (Colour only four faces)
3.	Como é que te sentiste por não usares o manual de Inglês? (pinta uma carinha)/ How did you feel about not using your English course book? (Colour one face)
Gostaste das aulas sem teres de usar o manual
de Inglês?

Figure 12 - Questionnaire 2 - Q1: “Gostaste das aulas sem teres de usar o manual de Inglês?”
To the question “Did you like English without the course book?”, 16 students responded they enjoyed the lessons while only two did not like it very much. With these results it is clear that, although they also like to use the course book, they do not mind learning without it. If initially I was afraid of teaching without the course book for fear that they would not like the idea of not working with it, it seems that my work in this class was successful in that sense and they did not miss their 'old friend'.
Figure 13 - Questionnaire2 - Q2: "De que e que mais gostaste nesta aulas?"
Considering what they liked the most in these lessons, the students' preferences were: the games (15 votes), the songs and working in pairs (12 votes each)
and the materials and working in groups (10 votes each). Listening exercises come closer with eight votes and what they liked the least were the written exercises (three votes) and working individually (two votes).
These results show that games play a huge role in the students' engagement in the English lessons: they promote an enjoyable environment in the classroom and they are fun (Read, 2007: 150). The same must be said about the songs: in this case I believe they referred specifically to Topsy-turvy house, so I must believe that my choice worked very positively because of the absurdity of the song but most of all because they were able to create their own version. I also feel very pleased for observing that they enjoyed working in pairs and in groups.
Considering working in pairs, although there was that one activity that did not go well, they worked like this more times and I observed they enjoyed doing it and were engaged. They also enjoyed working in groups and they were able to respect each other and organize their projects with confidence and responsibility. I may be wrong, but from the insight that I have, the students enjoyed working in pairs or groups this much because it is something they are not really used to doing. Finally I found it interesting that they also liked the materials I used, which makes me really happy and proud of myself. It means they acknowledged the things I did for their lessons, so the time and effort was worth it.
As in Questionnaire 1, written exercises do not seem to be the favourite activity for the students and in fact it was not a priority for me while planning my lessons. I consider they have plenty of time to practise writing in the near future and I favoured speaking, reading and listening more. Despite being voted as the least favourite, they obviously enjoyed writing their own song.

To the final question “How did you feel about not using your English course book?” the majority of the students (17) responded they felt happy or indifferent about using the course book or not and only one admitted having felt sad. This confirms that they are perfectly fine with learning using different materials and resources other than the course book.
3.3.7	- Results and discussion summary
Throughout this chapter, I was able to show and discuss the evidence I collected from my study. In the first stage, I presented the importance of analysing the course book to devise my future work, which helped me to be aware of the course book's “strengths and weaknesses” (Ek§i, 2010: 239) and to have my own point of view. After that I explained and discussed the processes of working with and without the course book: the process of planning between those two moments was different and despite having much more work planning on my own, I felt more comfortable teaching my unit than that suggested by the course book.
Taking into account the materials I used, it was clear that I used many more resources in the lessons without the course book. I spent much time and money creating my own resources, but they were made to last and I enjoyed making them. The course books resources were not always reliable in my point of view (e.g. A5 flashcards with small images which the students could not understand).
Considering the results of a successful and an unsuccessful activity for both moments: with the course book the lessons regularly went well and the one that did not go so well was due to my option of keeping to my lesson plan instead of adapting to suit the students' mood on that day; without the course book, the lessons also went well, although some of my choices planning the activities were not always successful and not adequate both for the stronger and for the weaker students.
Questionnaires 1 and 2 given to the students were also analysed mainly to validate what I could observe during the lessons: they enjoyed working with the course book but they also enjoyed the lessons without it and they demonstrated more enthusiasm and engagement during these lessons.
In the end, I think the biggest find was that both the children and I preferred the lessons without the course book.
Chapter 4: Conclusion
4.1	- Brief summary of research questions and findings
To my initial question “What are the possibilities of using a course book as a menu?" my choice fell on building a whole unit planned by me from scratch and making or using my own materials. When comparing the lessons I taught in both moments - with and without the course book - there was no clear evidence of activities that had gone wrong while teaching based on the course book, but the same did not happen during the lessons planned by me. As could be realized, my options were not always successful whether in terms of challenge or meaningfulness of the activities, which I think were intrinsically related to poor judgement while planning, especially when defining the aims. I must admit maybe I was being too ambitious with my area of interest. However, the students seemed to enjoy more the lessons without the course book than those with the course book.
Regarding the question “What differs between teaching solely based on the course book and teaching without the course book?", the major differences were felt during the planning process in my stage 3. Choosing the topic to teach was the easiest part, but designing the unit plan and lesson plans and creating the materials were an exhausting path. Nevertheless, I always felt very at ease doing what I thought of myself, even with its flaws, than teaching the way the course book indicates and I believe that contributed to such a good environment in the classroom. Maybe that also justifies why they enjoyed the lessons designed by me so much.
4.2	- Relevance of the results for my development as a teacher
What I definitely learned more about with my study was how to plan a lesson properly. As I mentioned initially, I had already worked as an AEC teacher for a few years but I was baffled by everything that I learned about lesson planning. The MA and this practicum gave me a real perception of how defining aims for each lesson and
goals for the students regarding each activity is essential when preparing the sessions. I will not say I was a bad teacher before that - I always planned my lessons for each class and I always took their specificities into consideration - but now I see that having a proper lesson plan improves the quality of my lessons, of the activities and tasks and my performance as teacher.
At the same time, I learned that what we think might work, even fairly planning, in fact may have the opposite effect. As a teacher and for the future, I must be more alert to the signs the students give whether they are bored or restless and I need to be able to improvise more and change plans if what I am doing is not working.
Concerning the self-made materials, I felt proud of what I was able to research and create and those materials are now available for upcoming lessons with other classes as I was very careful making them to last for a long time. However, the time I spent making those materials was huge and thinking that I had to plan so many lessons not forgetting my personal job as an AEC teacher, it can be truly demanding at times. If I could and if I had much more time too, I would like to create a story and if I was skilled at music, maybe to write and produce a song related to the topics in question. In this sense, I consider that course books have full advantage because they generally present us and the students with beautiful stories, with characters the students get easily used to and the songs are very funny and appealing.
Last but not least, this study helped me realize I need to practice more how to implement pair work activities. I tried it a couple of times and overall it worked, but I always missed the 'information gap' factor that makes the activity meaningful. For the future I have to research more relevant activities with a clear purpose.
4.3	- Further thoughts
Considering my concern about implementing more pair work activities, while planning according to the course book in unit 1, I noticed that there were not many activities requiring non-individual work, exception made to the role plays, songs and games. This can be a perfect example of how teachers should easily adapt and supplement activities in order to make the lessons more students-centred and triggering their interests.
4.4	- How the results might be relevant to other classrooms or situations
I think that what this study may mostly offer is a view that it is indeed possible to work on the MC without using the course book. It is time-consuming and it can be exhaustive but if teachers could try to design a unit every now and then, in a short period of time they would build their own repertoire they could use anytime from then on to supplement the course book. In this sense, it is important to have a critical eye towards the course book in use and there should be an awareness of the importance of the SARS model in order to enhance each lesson.

Appendix 7 - Lesson plan (12th October 2016)
Lesson plan - 12th October 2016 (Thursday)
Trainee: Ana Louren^o	Supervisor:
Class:	Class size: 19
Date:12/10/2016	Level: 4th
Class profile (a brief description of the class)
In this class, there are 8 girls and 10 boys.
They are very interested, competitive (in a good way), eager to learn but talkative and sometimes restless. Overall, it is a great class, with great students.
Aims for the lesson (language/skills/other aims)
To introduce a new unit: identify and say words related to places in town.
Timetable fit (why you are teaching this content at this point in the course)
This is the first unit suggested by the CB and by the trimester's planning made by the English teachers in my cluster. It is also the first stage for my report: to work only based on the CB.
Anticipated problems and possible solutions (language/behaviour/ other things that might affect your lesson)
Ss might struggle to pronounce some words correctly.
Possible solution: repeating two or three times each while doing the listening exercise; ask some Ss to answer to what I'm pointing at and recasting when necessary; the chant, played two or three times, will also help them to improve their pronunciation.
Behaviour issues (Ss talking loudly and all at the same time trying to answer)/ time management. Possible solution: a change in the initial routines, because that is where most of the time has been wasted.
Language content: Vocabulary
A library, a police station, a market, a school, a toy shop, a post office, a café, a playground.
Language content: Structures/Grammar
What do you see? (I see) A market, a café...
Intercultural content
Materials
Course book, page 6; CD 1 - tracks, 5 - 7; New Treetops 4 USB flash drive; projector; lyrics of the chant to project on the board.
Extra activities ( for early finishers)
Homework
Assessment ( self/peer assessment or teacher assessment)
Observation grid - teacher assessment.

Appendix 10 - Topsy-turvy house original lyrics
My house is topsy turvy it's a topsy turvy house. A sofa in the bedroom, A bed in the kitchen.
A TV in the bathroom.
In my topsy turvy house.
My house is topsy turvy it's a topsy turvy house.
A bath in the dining room, A wardrobe in the kitchen. A fridge in the living room In my topsy turvy house.
My house is topsy turvy it's a topsy turvy house.
A rabbit in the cupboard, A mouse in the fridge.
A fish in the wardrobe.
In my topsy turvy house.

4. Story time: “A messy bedroom” Coursebook (pp. 42-43) CD2 - track 31 -	8-10 minutes (L2 and L1)	To listen, understand and read a story. To introduce prepositions of place.	Then, Ss will be asked to open their CBs on page 42. T plays track 31 (CD2) and Ss listen, read and underline words they don't know (if there are any). In the end, T asks for any questions (if they didn't understand any words or don't know how to spell) and makes questions about the story (e.g. What does Bud's bedroom look like? Tidy? Messy? Where are Bud and Squirrel in picture 9? Where is the umbrella?). T asks Ss' opinion about the importance of having a tidy bedroom and what their bedrooms look like (in L1).

Class profile (a brief description of the class)
In this class, there are 8 girls and 10 boys.
They are very interested, competitive (in a good way), eager to learn but talkative and sometimes restless. Overall, it is a great class, with great students.
Aims for the lesson (language/skills/other aims)
At the end of the lesson, Ss will be able to identify and recognize vocabulary related to furniture, while using short sentences.
Skills: speaking, listening, thinking and reading.
Timetable fit (why you are teaching this content at this point in the course)
Learning, practising and consolidating vocabulary related to furniture, so in the following lessons Ss can start learning and using prepositions.
Anticipated problems and possible solutions ( language/behaviour/ other things that might affect your lesson)
I made the audio for the listening exercises myself. Although I already tried it and it sounds good, if somehow there's trouble with the sound, I'll read it to them.
There might be some noise during the pair work (puzzle game), because it is the first time they have done it. I'll explain they must talk in a lower tone and demonstrate first on the board what they have to do, using L1 if necessary to save time and get their questions clarified.
Stage 6 will depend on the time spent in the previous activities. If there is no time, I'll leave it to the next lesson, instead of being in a rush.
Language content: Vocabulary
Furniture: cupboard, fridge, bed, bath, wardrobe, sofa, TV.
Language content: Structures/Grammar
What is it? It's a sofa.
Is it a sofa? No, it's not/ Yes, it is.

Checks if they understood by asking them to raise their hand while calling “Student A/Student B”. Each pair will have 7 puzzled pictures (furniture items). Together, they must join the pieces until finding the 7 items. After that, they must practise question/answer: A points to a picture/puzzle and asks “What is it?”; B answers “It's a (wardrobe)”. They must do this with all the seven pictures/puzzles. T makes explicit that no Portuguese is allowed, they must speak only English.	T - Ss T
