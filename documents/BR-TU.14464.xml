ABSTRACT

Evidences of coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul have been obtained by three methods: (a) analysis of

the long-term morphodynamics and stratigraphy of coastal barriers, (b) annual shoreline mapping using the

Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), and (c) local beach profile measurements. The first method

reflects coastal erosion as continuity of the geological evolution in the last 5 ka, taking place mainly along

the southern half of gentle coastal projections. The second method represents a shorter temporal scale and

indicates that approximately 80% of the coast is eroding. Beach profiling has been measured in very few

places that are distant from each other since the early 1990s; consequently, their results reflect local and

very short time shoreline behavior. A critical evaluation of published data addressing coastal erosion in Rio

Grande do Sul strongly suggests that short and long term negative balance on the sediment budget is the main

cause of erosion along this coastline.

Key words: coastal evolution, Quaternary, shoreline changes, coastal barriers, sediment budget.

INTRODUCTION

Coastal erosion is a process occurring worldwide,

especially on low-lying coastal plains (Bird 1985).

Many studies have discussed the causes of erosion,

in the short and long temporal and spatial scales.

Erosion usually results from the combination of

multiple factors interacting along the coast. How-

ever, regardless of the time and spatial scale, coastal

erosion is essentially a consequence of sea level rise

and/or negative sediment budget.

Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is the southernmost

state of Brazil (Fig. 1). Except for the northernmost

136 km, its 620-km long shoreline is mainly unde-

veloped and visited mostly in the summer months

when calm and warm weather prevails (Esteves et

al. 2003b). Probably, this is the reason why coastal

studies have not attracted the attention of commu-

nity, government, or researchers until recently. Only

in the late 1980s, studies started to focus on coastal

processes, including the first published note ad-

dressing beach erosion in RS (Tomazelli and Vill-

wock 1989). Since then, coastal erosion in RS has

been discussed on several studies, mainly regarding

its natural and human-induced causes in the long-

(e.g. Tomazelli et al. 1998, Tomazelli and Dillen-

burg 1998, Dillenburg et al. 2000) and short-term

(e.g. Calliari et al. 1998a,b, Esteves et al. 2000,

Toldo et al. 1999). Recently, attempts have been

made to critically evaluate published data on ero-

sion along the RS coast (Esteves et al. 2002).

The increasing interest on coastal processes

and shoreline changes reflects the intensification of

coastal occupation and beach use, as well as the

growing economic importance of beach-related

tourism. This paper aims to critically evaluate the

state-of-the-art in the knowledge of coastal erosion

in RS almost 15 years after the first studies about

this theme.

REGIONAL SETTING

The southern Brazil continental margin is a rifted

plate boundary formed in Early Cretaceous times.

In the vicinity of Rio Grande do Sul (29? to 34? south
latitudes), deposition of a large amount of post-rift,

mainly clastic sediments, produced a wide (100 to

200 km), shallow (100 to 140 m), and gently sloping

(0.03? to 0.08?) continental shelf. Seismic records
of the upper slope reveal a sedimentary thickness of

at least 10 km (Fontana 1990).

Rio Grande do Sul coastline is characterized

by a 620-km long and gently undulating barrier,

generally oriented NE-SW, comprised essentially

by exposed, fine sand, dissipative to intermediate

beaches (Fig. 1). It is one of the longest sandy

beaches of the world, presenting only two perma-

nent discontinuities (Tramandaí and Patos lagoon

inlets).

Climate is humid temperate with annual mean

temperatures of 18?C, presenting warm to hot tem-
peratures in summer (mean of 26?C) and cool tem-
peratures in winter (mean of 12?C). Rainfall is
evenly distributed throughout the year, ranging

from 1000 to 1500 mm. The dominant northeast

winds persistently blow along the RS coast, al-

though southerly winds are the strongest and more

frequent during the fall and winter seasons.

This is a microtidal coast with semidiurnal

tides presenting a mean range of 0.5 m. Thus, sedi-

ment transport and deposition along the open coast

is primarily dominated by wave action. Although

the most frequent waves are generated by local and

usually long-lasting winds from the northeast,

southerly waves associated to the formation of

extra-tropical cyclones far away in the Mid-Atlantic

are the strongest. The average significant wave

height is 1.5 m, measured at depths of about 15-20 m

(Motta 1969). A net northward littoral drift is ev-

ident in coastal geomorphologic features (Tomazelli

and Villwock 1992) and by field measurements

(Toldo et al. 1993). At present, RS beaches receive

very little sand from inland as most of the beadload

carried through the drainage system is trapped in

lagoons and other coastal plain environments

(Tomazelli et al. 1998).

The post-glacial sea level history of the RS

coast extends from about 17.5 ka BP, when the sea

was positioned at about -120 to -130 m (Corrêa

1995). Since then, sea level rose at an average rate

of 1.2 cm/yr until 6.5 ka BP, when it started to slow

down (Fig. 2). There is no reliable data on sea level

change from the Middle to Late Holocene along the

RS coast. Sea level curves established for areas fur-

ther north in Brazil indicate that sea level reached

a few meters above its present level at the culmi-

nation of the Post-glacial Marine Transgression –

PMT (5 ka BP), followed thereafter by a slow sea

level fall (Martin et al. 1979, Angulo and Lessa

1997) (Fig. 2). It is likely that the general shape

of these sea level curves also apply to the northern

sector of the Rio Grande do Sul coast (Dillenburg

1996), although peaks might have not reached the

same level. The sea level curve presented by Martin

et al. (1979) show a maximum of +5 m for the coast

of Bahia (NE Brazil). Angulo and Lessa (1997)

suggest a maximum sea level around +3.5 m in the

states of São Paulo (SE Brazil) and Paraná (southern

Brazil, north of RS). Finally, Angulo et al. (1999)

show evidences of a maximum around +2 m in the

state of Santa Catarina, 100 km north of RS.

QUATERNARY COASTAL EVOLUTION

The geologic evolution of the RS coastal plain was

described by Villwock et al. (1986) and detailed in

several following studies (i.e. Villwock and Toma-

zelli 1995, Tomazelli et al. 2000). This section sum-

marizes the main points of the Quaternary coastal

evolution, as it is a key-factor for the present shore-

line configuration.

The coastal plain comprises two major depo-

sitional systems formed by sea level fluctuations in

the Quaternary: the alluvial fan deposits that mark

the western limit of the coastal plain and the barrier-

lagoon systems developed seawards (Tomazelli et

al. 2000) (Fig. 1). The alluvial fan system consists

in coarse-grained clastic deposits originated from

gravity flows and accumulated at the base of the

highlands. These deposits date probably from the

Late Pliocene regression up to the Early Holocene.

Deposits at the edge of coalescent fans were eroded

by higher sea levels in the Pleistocene resulting in

marine and lagoon terraces that are particularly well

developed and preserved to the south.

Four barrier-lagoon depositional systems were

identified in the RS coastal plain, each represent-

ing the sedimentary record of a marine transgres-

sion, three during the Pleistocene and one in the

Holocene (Fig. 1). Each barrier represents the land-

ward limit of the respective maximum transgressive

event (Villwock and Tomazelli 1995, Tomazelli et

al. 2000). Villwock et al. (1986) named the four

barrier-lagoon systems as Barrier I (the oldest) to

IV (the youngest). Absolute ages of the Pleistocene

barriers are still unknown (Tomazelli et al. 2000).

An attempt to correlate the last major peaks of the

oxygen isotopic record and barrier formation sug-

gests that they were probably formed in the last

400 ka (Villwock and Tomazelli 1995). Barrier I,

II, and III correlate with oxygen isotopic stage 11

(about 400 ka), stage 9 (325 ka), and sub-stage 5e

(approximately 120 ka), respectively. Barrier IV

was formed in the Holocene and corresponds to

oxygen isotopic stage 1. About 18 ka ago, sea level

was near the present shelf break and rose steadily

up to 2-4 m above the present level at the maximum

of the last transgression (5 ka). Recent 14C data in-

dicate that Barrier IV was formed between 6.44 and

4.65 ka in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul

(Dillenburg et al. 2004b). After that, a slow sea

level fall (rates ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mm/year)

favored progradation of Barrier IV in the smooth

embayments in between Torres and Tramandaí and

in Rio Grande, and retreat along the coastal projec-

tions (Dillenburg et al. 2000).

EVIDENCES OF COASTAL EROSION

Analysis of the long-term morphodynamics and

stratigraphy of coastal barriers provided the most

conspicuous evidence of erosion along the RS coast,

the exposure of lagoonal muds and peat at the

present backshore in Hermenegildo and Bujuru

(Fig. 3a and b). The exhumation of relict muds

occurs continuously along 15 km alongshore in Her-

menegildo and 60 km in the area Bujuru-Conceição

lighthouse. In both locations muds are exposed

along the southern half of the gentle coastal projec-

tions. Lagoonal muds were dated (14C) on 4.33 ka

and 3.49 ka at Hermenegildo and Bujuru, respec-

tively (Tomazelli et al. 1998). The formation of

such deposits implies that, at that time, there was a

coastal barrier seaward of those places. Thus, some-

time later, the barrier started a landward translation

to reach its present position.

Foredunes in front of the Conceição lighthouse

have retreated at an average rate of 2.5 m/yr in the

period 1975-1995 (Tomazelli et al. 1998). As a con-

sequence of such intense erosion, the lighthouse felt

under wave attack during a storm in 1993 (Fig. 3c,

d and e). The analysis of beach profiles from 1996

to 1999 shows an average retreat rate of 3.6 m/yr for

the same area and 1 m/yr for Lagamarzinho beach,

about 70 km north of Conceição lighthouse (Bar-

letta and Calliari 2003). Unfortunately, beach pro-

files have been monitored locally and for less than

about a decade, at best. Consequently, their results

reflect local and short-time shoreline behavior only.

Since 1997, the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline

has been mapped in a yearly basis using the kine-

matic Differential Global Positioning System

(DGPS) method (Morton et al. 1993, Toldo et al.

1999, Esteves et al. 2003c). A DGPS is installed

in a vehicle moving along the water line in an av-

erage speed of about 50 km/h to register positions

every 3 s. DGPS errors are less than 1 m for the

method used. In an attempt to determine longer-

term changes, DGPS lines have been compared to

a digitized shoreline of 1975 obtained from topo-

graphic maps printed in a scale of 1:50,000 (Toldo

et al. 1999). Although the scale of the base maps is

inadequate to this type of study, it was the best avail-

able source for a statewide analysis in a time period

of more than a couple of years. A large error range

was used to qualitatively classify shore segments

in three classes: eroded, stable, and accreted. The

comparative analysis of the 1975 digitized shore-

line and the 2000 DGPS line indicates that approx-

imately 81% of the beaches are eroding, 12% are

stable, and the remaining 7% are accreting (Esteves

et al. 2002). Similarly, Toldo et al. (1999) identified

erosion along 84% of the shoreline and accretion

along about 8% for the 1975-1997 interval. Obvi-

ously, results will be more reliable after decades of

continued shoreline mapping from which long-term

trends and erosion rates can be determined.

CAUSES OF EROSION

Although evidences of erosion are clear, its causes

are still in debate. About 15 years ago, the first

paper addressing coastal erosion in RS suggested

that the key factor leading to erosion was a con-

temporaneous rise in sea level (Tomazelli and Vill-

wock 1989). Analysis of recent studies indicate that

negative balances on the sediment budget may play

a major role on coastal erosion.

Following, the discussion will focus on the two

main causes of coastal erosion: sea level rise and a

negative balance on sediment budget. Sea level rise

will be considered as a factor producing coastal ero-

sion in a long-term when rates of sea level exceeds

rates of sediment input. Sediment budget will be

discussed on both short and long term scales.

Relative Sea level Rise

A sea level rise is an outstanding cause of erosion

and an important factor on coastal evolution. Ma-

rine transgression occurs when the rate of sea level

rise exceeds the rates of sediment input to the coast.

Such conditions typically form transgressive barri-

ers on wave-dominated coasts (e.g. Roy et al. 1994).

A barrier translation under a rising sea level leads to

the overlying of lagoonal/estuarine fine sediments

by barrier sands, usually washover deposits.

Tomazelli and Villwock (1989) evocated that a

contemporaneous sea level rise is eroding the coast-

line of Rio Grande do Sul based on evidences such

as: (a) the exhumation of lagoonal muds at Herme-

negildo and Bujuru beaches, (b) the landward dune

transgression, and (c) a 1-meter depth terrace bor-

dering the Patos lagoon, interpreted as a drowned

lagoonal margin. The authors suggest that sea level

started to rise 1-2 ka ago, when it probably was 1-2 m

lower than the present level.

Lagoonal muds exposed at the backshore are

a strong evidence of coastline retreat. However,

the stratigraphy of transgressive barriers migrating

landwards due to a sea level rise, clearly shows

that, after barrier translation, lagoonal/estuarine

sediments may outcrop somewhere at the shoreface

or even at the continental shelf, but not at the back-

shore (see Kraft 1971, Morton 1995, Roy et al.

1994) (Fig. 4a). The outcrop of lagoonal sedi-

ments at the backshore typically occurs on barriers

that are translating landwards mainly controlled by

a negative balance on sediment budget during a rel-

atively stable sea level condition. A shift from a sea

level rise to a negative balance on sediment budget

as the main factor controlling barrier transgression

may lead to such stratigraphic record where la-

goonal muds outcrop at the backshore or even at the

foreshore on a microtidal barrier (Dillenburg et al.

2004a) (Fig. 4b and c).

The hypothesis of a rising sea level inducing

landward dune transgression was first presented by

Cooper (1958) while studying dune fields in Oregon

(USA). Since then, opposite ideas have suggested

that dunes transgression may be facilitated by the

exposure of shelf sands under a sea level fall (e.g.

Dominguez et al. 1987). According to Hesp and

Thom (1990), transgressive dunes can be activated

either by changes in external boundary conditions

(e.g. sea level change) or by internal morphody-

namic adjustments, being difficult to define which

one is the effective cause.

Finally, the 1-meter deep terrace bordering the

Patos lagoon is a product of lagoonal margin progra-

dation (Barboza, personal communication) rather

than a margin drowned by a 1-2 m rise in sea level,

as suggested by Tomazelli and Villwock (1989).

New 14C datings of shells from a 2.7-m long core

collected near the border and within the most con-

spicuous terrace showed ages of 240 ± 80 years and
310±60 years for samples collected at 2.0 and 2.3-m
deep, respectively (Barboza, personal communica-

tion). These ages do not support the hypothesis of

the terrace being a lagoonal margin older or even

contemporaneous to the rise in sea level occurred

at 1-2 ka ago, as suggested by Tomazelli and Vill-

wock (1989). Additionally, three studies indicate

a continuous sea level fall in the last 2 ka with no

evidences of levels below the present along the

southern Brazilian coast (Martin et al. 1979, An-

gulo and Lessa 1997, Angulo et al. 1999).

Coastal Sediment Budget

Sediment budget is a major factor controlling shore-

line changes. Sea level change is the key-factor

determining large-scale coastal evolution when it

rises or falls rapidly. However, when sea level is

stable (or quasi-stable), temporal and spatial varia-

tions in the sediment budget control barriers evolu-

tion (Roy et al. 1994). Generally, negative balances

on sediment budget favors shoreline retreat, while

positive balances favors progradation.

The RS coast presents two large lagoons along

the central (Patos lagoon) and southern coastal sec-

tors (Mirim lagoon) and several other small lagoons

and lakes along the northern littoral. This lagoon

system traps sediment from fluvial discharge, re-

ducing significantly the sand volume reaching the

shore (Tomazelli et al. 1998). Such condition exists

since the formation of Barrier IV, so inland sources

have not contributed to coastal sediment budget at

least in the last 5 ka. Alongshore gradients of wave

energy regulate the sand budget in the RS coast

(Dillenburg et al. 2003). Large-scale gentle coastal

projections concentrate wave energy while it is

dissipated in the gentle shelf gradients adjacent to

coastal reentrances. The latter has favored high rates

of onshore sand transfer inducing coastal prograda-

tion in a long-term (Dillenburg et al. 2000). Thus, a

link between coastal morphology, wave energy gra-

dients, and imbalances on sand budget is evident.

Changes in coastal sediment budget in RS will be

discussed below in terms of long and short temporal

and spatial scales.

Long Scale

Long-term changes on coastal sediment budget will

be discussed here as the influence of a macro-scale

shoreline configuration and shelf morphology on

the alongshore distribution of wave energy that has

strongly controlled coastal evolution in Rio Grande

do Sul (Dillenburg et al. 2000).

At the end of the Post-Glacial Marine Trans-

gression (5 ka) the contour of the RS coast was sim-

ilar to the present one, which is gently undulated,

alternating gentle reentrances and projections (Fig.

1). Since then, barriers prograded within coastal

reentrances and retreated mainly along the southern

half of coastal projections. This contrasting behav-

ior could not be explained by sea level changes alone

what would favor either progradation or retrograda-

tion under a falling or rising condition, respectively.

In fact, sea level has remained stable or felt very

slowly (about 2-4 m) in the last 5 ka, showing mi-

nor interference on coastal evolution. The deposi-

tional and erosional behavior of coastal reentrances

and projections, respectively, has been explained by

May and Tanner (1973) using a graphical model for

littoral sediment transport. In general terms, the

model explains how the coastline tends to flatten

out its embayments and projections by wave action.

Due to refraction, wave energy concentrates along

coastal projections while it is dispersed along the

reentrances. As a result, coastal projections erode

and the sediments are transported alongshore to be

deposited in adjacent embayments. Wave energy is

enhanced along coastal projections also due to the

steeper adjacent shelf morphology that dissipates

less energy by bottom friction (Wright 1974). As

long-term coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul is

restricted to protruding (steeper) sections of the

coast, it is believed that negative balances on sed-

iment budget due to wave energy concentration is

an important factor driving barrier retrogradation.

Considering that shoreline orientation and di-

rection of prevailing winds may have remained the

same throughout the Holocene to the present, the an-

gle waves approach to the shoreline is a factor that

might have significant influence on both the long-

and short-time scale. Lima et al. (2001) have esti-

mated the potential littoral drift along the RS coast

based on wave measurements in deep water apply-

ing the Energy Flux Method (USACE 1984). Their

results show that higher potential of alongshore sedi-

ment transport is estimated to occur along the south-

ern half of coastal projections (where shoreline ori-

entation is about N45?E), where intense coastal ero-
sion is usually observed. Thus, shoreline orientation

also plays an important role on the littoral drift and

coastal erosion along the RS.

Short Scale

Short scale variations on sediment budget are

related to natural and human-induced coastal pro-

COASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 619

cesses, such as offshore sand transport during storm

surges, concentration of wave energy due to sub-

merged small-scale features, and human activities.

Storm Surges

Storm surges occur when the passage of a coastal

storm induces water levels to exceed the predicted

tide (Dolan and Davis 1994). In southern Brazil,

they occur when S-SE winds pile water onshore dur-

ing the passage of intense cold fronts. Storm surges

are about 1.5-m high along the RS coast, where the

higher water level intensify the erosive capacity of

storm waves, causing severe damage at the coast

mainly when simultaneous with high spring tides

(Calliari et al. 1998b). This catastrophic combina-

tion is more frequent in April and May and is more

destructive as it lasts longer (Calliari et al. 1998b).

It is also known that the frequency of storms is also

a factor that influences beach erosion (Fenster et al.

2001).

Studies addressing the occurrence and impact

of storm surges in Brazil are scarce and limited to

the monitoring of individual events. Few examples

are the storms of July 14, 1993 and April 19-21,

1995 (Calliari et al. 1998b), April 3-5 and 24-26,

1997 (Barletta and Calliari 2003), and April 16, 1999

(Esteves et al. 2003a). The 1993 and the 1999

storms were very similar and consisted in extratrop-

ical cyclones formed after the passage of a cold front

striking the RS coast with average wind velocities

of about 75 km/h, resulting in a storm surge of 1.3m

and 0.8m (measured at the Rio Grande Port), respec-

tively (Esteves et al. 2000). Beach profile measure-

ments showed that the 1993 and 1999 storms caused

subaerial beach erosion in Hermenegildo of 60 m3/m

and 45 m3/m, respectively. Tozzi and Calliari (2000)

observed that maximum changes in sand volume oc-

cur when the first fall storms (from March to June)

erode the accreted profile built during the summer

months (from December to March). Based on the

results of Tozzi (personal communication), Esteves

et al. (2000) stated that the storm of April 1999

was a typical example of the high-energy events

that threat Hermenegildo once a year. The num-

ber of cold fronts passages along the RS coast in the

winter months (June to August) from 1988 to 1998

varied from 6 to 14, with a mean of 10 for that pe-

riod (Britto and Saraiva, personal communication).

However, it is still lacking studies that show storms

distribution and frequency, related storm surges, and

beach profile responses in a longer term (do they

fully recover?).

Concentration of Wave Energy Due to Submerged

Small-Scale Features

Recent studies have shown that convergence of

wave rays due to refraction on small-scale changes

in bathymetry concentrates wave energy at some

coastal sectors and is one of the probable causes of

erosion in Rio Grande do Sul (Calliari et al. 1998a,

Speranski and Calliari 2001). According to these

studies, convergence patterns in those two areas

were identified for waves with period longer than

9 s approaching from SSE-SW while a divergent

pattern is observed in the northern shores. Speranski

and Calliari (2001) suggest that wave “focus” is the

major cause of erosion in the Conceição lighthouse

area and in Hermenegildo. The authors have stated

that most of the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is sta-

ble as concentration of wave energy is not observed

along most of the coast. However, this mechanism

could not explain erosion in Lagamarzinho, where

Barletta and Calliari (2003) have estimated a retreat

rate of 1m/yr. Based on Calliari et al. (2003) data,

Esteves et al. (2002) estimated that wave refrac-

tion may explain erosion along about 15% of the RS

coast, accretion along 2%, and a variable response

along 8% of the RS shoreline. These data do not

imply that the remaining of the shoreline is stable,

as other factors clearly contribute to changes in RS

shorelines.

Human Activities

Despite the long and undeveloped coastal segments,

almost one-third of the state shoreline have been im-

pacted by human activities, such as urbanization in

An Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)

active dune areas, shore armoring, sand mining, and

construction of jetties (Esteves et al. 2000). Anthro-

pogenic activities affect local sand balance, more

in a way of intensifying natural shoreline changes

rather than generating them. For example, fixation

of the Patos lagoon inlet by two 4-km long jetties

accelerated accretion on updrift (southern) beaches

due to obstruction of the longshore sediment trans-

port, an area that was already prograding in the long-

term (Dillenburg et al. 2000). In Hermenegildo,

urbanization in the active beach/dune system and

coastal armoring seem to have aggravated erosion

in a long-term retreating shoreline. Coastal devel-

opment did not leave much space for natural beach

dynamics to take place increasing the risk of struc-

tures damage during storms (e.g. Tramandaí and

Hermenegildo). The artificial closure of natural

washouts might be another anthropogenic change

that tampers with local sand balance. In many

coastal communities, washouts were artificially

closed for road construction and tend to reopen tem-

porarily during intense rainfall events. Sand from

the dune/beach system has been used for landfill

and civil engineering purposes for a long time and,

in some places, resulted in the complete removal of

dunes. Although the impact of human activities in

the sand balance is still unknown, it seems to play a

role only in a local extent, enhancing natural trends

rather than reversing them (Esteves et al. 2002).

SUMMARY

Sandy barriers dominate the scenario along the 620-

km long Rio Grande do Sul coastline. The type

and evolution of these barriers during the last 5 ka

clearly indicate that sea level oscillations were not

the main factor controlling coastal evolution during

the Late Holocene. If that was the case, coastal

barriers would have evolved in a more uniform way.

Because minor or no sand is delivered by

streams to the coastal system in the last 5 ka, sed-

iment budget imbalances might have resulted from

alongshore gradients of wave energy. Negative bal-

ances on sediment budget were produced by con-

centration and enhancing of wave energy that are

the main factors driving the retrogradation of bar-

riers along coastal projections. In the other hand,

dispersion and reduction of wave energy resulted

in positive balances on the sediment budget, favor-

ing barrier progradation along coastal embayments.

Extensive exhumation of lagoonal muds along the

southern half of coastal projections (e.g. Bujuru

and Hermenegildo), where shoreline orientation is

N45?E, suggests that the appropriate angle of wave
attack plays an important role on coastal erosion.

As pointed out by Lima et al. (2001), the highest

rates of littoral drift occur along this shoreline’s ori-

entation. Therefore, there are evidences that erosion

along the RS shoreline is the continuity of a large-

scale geological evolution operating in the last 5 ka;

with erosion being more intense along the southern

half of gentle coastal projections.

The focusing of wave energy due to refrac-

tion on small-scale submerged features, suggested

by Calliari et al. (1998a) as the major cause of ero-

sion in the Conceição lighthouse and Hermenegildo,

sounds reasonable to explain local erosion. How-

ever, this process cannot explain the widespread

long-term erosion along most of the central RS coast,

from Estreito to Lagamarzinho (Fig. 5). If erosion

in Conceição lighthouse and Hermenegildo was due

to wave refraction on small-scale features only, the

shoreline should be locally reentrant, what is not

the case.

The short-term erosion detected from the anal-

ysis of 1997 and 2000 shorelines (mapped by DGPS)

and a coastal chart of 1975 should be viewed cau-

tiously. If erosion is really affecting approximately

80% of the coast of Rio Grande do Sul (Toldo et al.

1999, Esteves et al. 2002) a new explanation should

be formulated. The results presented by both au-

thors show a high frequency alternation of coastal

stretches under erosion, accretion, and stable. Such

behavior means that coastal processes are changing

continuously along the coast and/or their relative

dominance changes alongshore. If, in the future,

these results become more consistent with longer

historical data (a decade or more) new factors driv-

COASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 621

half of protruding (steeper) sections of the coast.

ing shoreline behavior should be investigated (e.g.

cell circulation controlled by submerged features in

the shoreface or inner shelf). The impact of human

activities in the sand balance is still unknown, but

seems to play a role only in a local extent.

RESUMO

Evidências de erosão costeira no Rio Grande do Sul têm

sido obtidas através de três métodos: (a) análises es-

tratigráficas e morfodinâmicas de longo período de bar-

reiras costeiras, (b) mapeamento anual da linha de costa

através do Sistema de Posicionamento Global Diferencial

(DGPS), e (c) levantamentos altimétricos de perfis praiais.

O primeiro método mostra a erosão costeira como uma

continuidade da evolução geológica nos últimos 5 ka, e

ocorrendo principalmente na metade sul de suaves pro-

jeções costeiras. O segundo método representa uma es-

cala temporal curta e indica que, aproximadamente 80%

da costa está em erosão. Levantamentos altimétricos de

perfis praiais têm sido executados em poucos locais, dis-

tantes uns dos outros, desde o início dos anos 1990; e,

conseqüentemente, seus resultados refletem um compor-

tamento local e de curto período da linha de costa. A

avaliação crítica dos dados até hoje publicados sobre a

erosão da linha de costa do Rio Grande do Sul sugere

fortemente que o balanço negativo no estoque de sedi-

mentos costeiros, em escalas de longo e curto período, é

a principal causa da erosão.

Palavras-chave: evolução costeira, Quaternário, mudan-

ças da linha de praia, barreiras costeiras, estoque de sedi-

mentos.
