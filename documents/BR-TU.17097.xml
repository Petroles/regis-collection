ABSTRACT

The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is considered the gold
standard method for determination of aerobic /anaerobic metabo-
lic transition during continuous exercise, but the blood lactate re-
sponse at this intensity is ergometer-dependent in human beings.
An important tool for exercise physiology and correlated fields is
the use of animal models. However, investigation on evaluation
protocols in rats is scarce. The aim of the present study was to
verify if the MLSS is ergometer-dependent for the evaluation of
the aerobic conditioning of rats. Therefore, 40 adult male Wistar
rats were evaluated in two different exercise types: swimming and
treadmill running. In both, the MLSS was obtained with 4 conti-
nuous 25 minutes tests, at different intensities, performed at 48
hours intervals. In all tests, blood samples were collected from a
cut at the tail tip every 5 minutes for blood lactate analysis. The
swimming tests occurred in a deep cylindrical tank, with water
temperature at 31 ± 1°C. The loads used in the tests were 4.5; 5.0;
5.5 and 6.0% of the body weight tied to the animal’s back. For
MLSS determination in running exercise, there was selection of
running rats and velocities used in the tests were 15, 20, 25, 30
m.min-1. The MLSS was interpreted as an increase not exceeding
1.0 mM of blood lactate, from the 10th to the 25th minute of exer-
cise. The MLSS in swimming exercise occurred at 5.0% of body
weight (bw), with blood lactate at 5.20 ± 0.22 mM. The running
rats presented MLSS at the 20 m.min-1 velocity, with blood lactate
of 3.87 ± 0.33 mM. The results indicated that the MLSS is ergom-
eter-dependent in experimental models using animals, as it is in
human beings.

INTRODUCTION

The determination of the metabolic predominance for the ener-
gy supply during an exercise presents extreme importance for the
correct prescription of an activity. Accordingly, there are many pro-
posed evaluation protocols in order to detect the intensity of tran-
sition between the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms (Wasser-
man and McIloroy, 1964; Monod and Scherrer, 1965; Kinderman et
al., 1979; Sjödin and Jacobs, 1981; Chassain, 1986 and Tegtbur et
al., 1993).

Exercise physiology and correlated fields have been developing
simple and complex methodologies over the years, with the pur-
pose to determine the effort intensity. According to Gaesser and
Poole (1996), the physiological responses facing the exercise trust-
fully signal the characteristic of the predominant metabolism of
the energy supply for the given activity. Among these responses it
is possible to highlight the blood lactacidemia.

The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), defined as the high-
est intensity in which the anaerobic metabolism still predominates
over the aerobic, is currently considered the gold standard method
for the determination of the transition intensity between these
metabolisms in continuous exercise performed by humans (Beneke,
1995; Beneke, 2003, Billat et al., 2003). According to Beneke et al.
(1995), the lactacidemic response in this intensity is dependent on
the ergometer used by these individuals, which implies in careful
generalizations of mistaken information on the training loads pre-
scribed by the concentration of blood lactate.

The importance to precisely determine the exercise intensity is
not restricted to works in which humans are objects of the study.
A tool that has been considered interesting to the organism obser-
vation facing effort is the use of experimental models with ani-
mals. Such models have been elaborated in order to simulate phys-
iopathological or training-related situations occurred with humans,
and solve occasional problems derived from the observed alter-
ations (Oliveira et al., 2005; Braga et al., 2004; Murdes et al., 2004).

With this aim, Gobatto et al. (2001) evaluated the MLSS in sed-
entary rats adapted to the aquatic environment, submitted to the
swimming exercise, as proposed by Heck et al. (1985) for evalua-
tion in humans. Thereby, the animals performed 20 minutes of
continuous effort in intensities correspondent to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and
10% of their body weight attached to their bodies, with blood sam-
ples collection being conducted at every five minutes for later lac-
tacidemia determination. The authors observed MLSS in intensi-
ties correspondent to 6% of the body weight, with stabilization
concentration of 5,5 mM. This index is different and higher than
the one reported for humans in distinct exercises and for rats per-
forming effort in rolling treadmill (approximately 4 mM). In a recent
review on the maximal lactate steady state, Billat et al. (2003) point
out the findings by Gobatto et al. (2001) as representative for the
study with animals.

Other evaluation protocols have been developed in swimming,
such as the determination of the critical load and anaerobic work
ability (Marangon et al., 2002) and minimal lactate test (Voltarelli et
al., 2002). However, due to its great importance, all of them use
the MSLL as gold Standard in order to validate their procedures.

The rolling treadmill is another ergometer widely used for train-
ing in rats, and thereby, the detection of the effort intensity in run-
ning exercise is extremely important. In 1993, Pillis et al. proposed
the application of incremental test and observation of the lactaci-
demic response for aerobic evaluation of runner rats, based on the
anaerobic thresholds concepts (Lan) suggested for humans (Sjod-
in and Jacobs, 1981). Therefore, the animals performed a test char-
acterized by the progressive velocity increase, with five minute-
stages and blood samples collection at the end of each load, with
later determination of the anaerobic threshold through exponential
behavior analysis of the lactacidemic curve. The rats’ anaerobic
threshold was obtained at 25 m.min-1, in a lactate concentration of
4 mM. The results of this study revealed blood lactate behavior



234e Rev Bras Med Esporte _ Vol. 12, Nº 5 – Set/Out, 2006

similar to the one described for humans, with the same concentra-
tion associated with the Lan, indeed. However, in the rats swim-
ming, Gobatto et al. (1991) did not find this classic exponential
behavior of the blood lactate curve, which suggests the need of
further investigation on the lactate kinetic in animals submitted to
physical exercise and the lactate responses distinction in different
ergometers.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the max-
imal lactate steady state is dependent on the ergometer used for
the aerobic evaluation in rats, as it is for humans, due to this meth-
od’s importance and also for prevention of mistakes in the pre-
scription of activity for animals in different kinds of exercise.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

All experiments were conducted according to the American
College of Sports Medicine politics and approved by the Biosciences
Institute of the São Paulo State University – UNESP, Rio Claro.
Forty-four Wistar rats, with 90 days of age, weighting 443 ± 33 g,
were used. During the experimental period, the animals were kept
in collective cages (five rats per cage) in a lighted room with light-
dark cycle of 12:00-12:00 hs and temperature of 25°C. The rats
received commercial food specific for rodents (Labina-Purina) and
water ad libitum.

Experimental protocol

Adaptation to the water environment

Twenty animals were submitted to maximal lactate steady state
tests in swimming exercise. The rats were adapted to the water
environment in a standardized manner prior to the tests conduc-
tion. The adaptation occurred in a total period of 15 uninterrupted
days, in a cylindrical tank with smooth surface, measuring 60 cm
of diameter by 120 cm of depth (Marangon et al., 2001), with wa-
ter temperature kept at 31 ± 1°C (Harri and Kuusela, 1986). The
purpose of the adaptation was to decrease the animal’s stress with-
out promoting physiological adaptations derived from the physical
training, though.

Initially, the rats were inserted in shallow water for three days
during 15 minutes. Later, the water level was increased, as well as
the effort duration time and the load to be held by the animal. Thus,
on the forth day, the rats swam in deep water for two minutes,
with increase of two minutes at each day until the tenth day of
adaptation. On the eleventh day, the animals were submitted to
the swimming exercise for five minutes holding a load of 3% of
their body weight, with increase of five minutes at each day, when,
on the fifteenth day, the adaptation ceased.

Selection of the runner rats and adaptation to the treadmill

It was necessary to previously select the runner animals in or-
der to conduct the tests in treadmill. The selection occurred in a
seven day-period, in which the 20 rats that presented positive re-
sponse to the running stimulus at least five times were chosen
After the selection, the animals were submitted to an adaptation
to the treadmill exercise, with progressive velocities (5 to 20 m.min-
1) and duration (5 to 15 min). The aim of the adaptation was also
the reduction of stress indices presented by the animal due to the
task being known without physical training promotion.

Determination of the maximal lactate steady state

The whole experimental protocol was conducted in environmen-
tal conditions identical to the ones during the adaptation period,
both in swimming and in treadmill running.

In both exercises, the protocol for the MLSS determination con-
sisted of five continuous tests with duration of 25 minutes, in dif-
ferent effort intensities, randomly distributed and separated by a

48-hour resting interval. In all tests there was blood collection of
the animals‘ tails in the resting times, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes
of exercise, for later blood lactate analysis and the lactacidemic
curves in each intensity.

Swimming tests

The rats performed 25 minutes of continuous effort in loads
equivalent to 4,5; 5,0; 5,5 and 6,0% of their body weight, attached
to their backs. There was daily load adjustment, with the animals‘
body mass measurement. Blood samples from the animals‘ tails
were performed for each intensity in the times previously described,
and the blood sample’s treatment occurred according to a tech-
nique detailed below.

Treadmill running tests

For the MLSS evaluation in running, the selected animals per-
formed the continuous tests in the 15, 20, 25 and 30 m.min-1 ve-
locities. The treadmill specific for training with rats composed of
eight lanes, was kept with the electric shock off, reducing hence,
the stress effect in the effort conducted by the animal. Blood sam-
ples were removed from the rats‘ tails as in swimming.

Blood samples and analysis

During the continuous tests, blood samples (25 µl) were removed
from the animal’s tail in the times already described and placed in
Eppendorf tubes (capacity of 1,5 ml), containing 50 µl of sodium
fluoride (1%). In order to avoid the blood dilution in water in the
case of the swimmers, the animals were removed from the cylin-
der and dried, returning to the aquatic environment immediately
after the blood collection. The blood lactate concentrations were
determined in a lactate analyzer (Model YSI 1500 Sport, Yellow
Springs, OH, EUA).

Statistical analysis

In both ergometers the MLSS was interpreted as the highest
exercise intensity in which the increase of the lactacidemia was
equal or lower than 1 mM, from the 10th to the 25th minute. The
average concentrations of blood lactate in each intensity for the
two ergometers were obtained through the ratio of the lactaci-
demic indices of the times 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes of exercise.
A one-way ANOVA was used in order to identify the differences
between the blood lactate concentrations in the several durations
of the continuous exercise and between distinct ergometers: swim-
ming and treadmill running. The results are expressed in average
± standard error of the average. In all statistical procedures, the
significance index was preset in P &amp;lt;0,05 (Dawson-Saunders and
Trapp, 1994).

RESULTS

The blood lactate curves of the rats submitted to the swimming
exercise are expressed in figure 1. The MLSS was observed in the
intensity equivalent to 5% of the body weight, in an average lac-
tate concentration of 5,20 ± 0,22 mM.

In the running exercise, the velocity correspondent to the max-
imal lactate steady state was 20 m.min-1, in lactate concentration
of 3,87 ± 0,33 mM, though (figure 1). In the intensity equivalent to
30 m.min-1 only 20% of the animals completed the test.

The one-way ANOVA identified significant difference between
the maximal lactate steady state obtained in the swimming exer-
cise and the treadmill running.

DISCUSSION

Although the lactate production occurs internally in the skeletal
muscle, the blood measurements of this metabolite during exer-
cise provide precise information about the energetic supply for the

ificity of the water tank used. In the present work, it was chosen to
perform the swimming exercise in a deep tank (60 cm of diameter
by 120 cm of depth) with a smooth surface, avoiding thus, that the
animals could lean on the sides of the tank during the test or could
touch the bottom of the tank performing a jump movement. In the
study by Gobatto et al. (2001), the tanks used were not deep (100
cm of diameter by 80 cm of depth), which possibly favored the
rats‘ activity.

The stabilization concentration of the lactate in the maximal aer-
obic intensity in swimming was 5,20 ± 0,22 mM, an index very
close to the one described by Gobatto et al. (2001) for sedentary
rats (5,5 mM), which suggests reproducibility of this concentration
for the species of evaluated animals. Even after aerobic training,
Gobatto et al. (2001) did not observe alteration in the lactate stabi-
lization concentration. In humans, the lactate stabilization in maxi-
mal aerobic intensity is usually found between 3 and 7 mM (Steg-
mann et al., 1981; Harnish et al., 2000), however, in swimming
exercise, this index seems to be close to the lower threshold of
the described group. Pereira et al. (2002) determined the anaero-
bic threshold of swimming athletes in progressive test and ob-
served inflexion of the lactacidemic curve in 3,5 mM concentra-
tion. Thus, it seems that Wistar rats present higher lactate
concentration indices in the MLSS in swimming exercise when
compared to humans.

In the treadmill running we obtained MLSS in 20 m.min-1 intensi-
ty in 3,87 ± 0,33 mM concentration. Pillis et al. (1993) and Langfort
et al. (1996) suggest the occurrence of the anaerobic threshold in
runner rats in the 25 m.min-1 velocity, which is higher than in our
findings. In the present study, the animals were submitted to 25
minutes of continuous exercise in the 15, 20, 25 and 30 m.min-1

velocities, allowing a longer observation of the blood lactate kinet-
ic, while those authors only observed the lactate behavior related
to progressive exercise.

Concerning the lactate concentration, the treadmill exercise pro-
moted stabilization in an index significantly lower to the one ob-
served in swimming (figures 1 and 2). The lactacidemic concentra-
tion verified in the present study is similar to the point of inflexion
of the lactate curve described by Pillis et al. (1993) (4 mM) and to
the index obtained in a classic study performed with humans in
this kind of exercise (Heck et al., 1985). There are no works in the
literature which present aerobic training results in running in max-
imal lactate steady state with Wistar rats, as the one conducted by
Gobatto et al. (2001) in swimming.

Our results clearly demonstrate the ergometer dependence of
the maximal lactate steady state protocol in exercises for Wistar
rats, as well as in humans. Such fact demands caution in the eval-
uation and prescription of physical training for these animals. Fur-
ther studies should be conducted with rats in different physiopatho-
logical and training conditions in order to identify possible alterations
in the evaluated aerobic parameter.

effort. Such fact implies in the use of this parameter as a prescrip-
tion instrument (Mujika et al., 1995) and sports training aid (Pyne
et al., 2001).

The maximal lactate steady state is related to the biochemical
balance between appearance and removal of the blood lactate
(Mader and Heck, 1986) and is considered the highest exercise
intensity in which this steady state still occurs, outlining hence, a
transition of aerobic-anaerobic metabolic predominance (Beneke,
1995; Billat et al., 2003). Therefore, it is considered a safe method
for aerobic ability identification (Jones and Carter, 2000), which
corroborates so that many studies use this procedure in the evalu-
ation of active individuals and high performance athletes (Jones
and Doust, 1998; Harnish et al., 2001; Beneke, 2003).

Our study is important due to the application of this individual
protocol in order to evaluate laboratory animals in two different
kinds of exercise: swimming and treadmill running. Moreover, there
is massive scientific meaning in obtaining data about probable dif-
ferences of lactacidemic responses in two ergometers widely used
for training of Wistar rats.

Concerning swimming, our MLSS results are similar to the ones
shown by Gobatto et al. (2001) and Voltarelli et al. (2002). The blood
lactate stabilization for our sedentary rats was obtained in 5% of
the body weight, as described by Voltarelli et al. (2002). Gobatto et
al. (2001) reported stabilization load equal to 6% bw. Such small
distinction in the load related to the MLSS may be due to the spec-
