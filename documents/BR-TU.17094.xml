ABSTRACT – This study reports on the conodonts from an outcrop region in the south Amazonas Basin that
comprises the lower part of the Itaituba Formation. The studied area consists of two limestone quarries,
informally named 1 and 2, owned by CAIMA, a cement industry. The conodont association includes Pa
elements of Idiognathodus incurvus, Idiognathoides sinuatus, Neognathodus roundyi, N. medadultimus, N.
bassleri, N. atokaensis, Adetognathus lautus, Hindeodus minutus, Diplognathodus coloradoensis, and
Idioprioniodus sp. It is herein proposed one informal taxon-range zone and one subzone, respectively:
Idiognathoides sinuatus zone and Neognathodus roundyi subzone. The conodonts occur mainly in the packstones,
and subordinately in the wackestones and mudstones. The Itaituba Formation is the richest interval containing
normal marine organisms in the Pennsylvanian of Amazonas Basin. The associated fauna includes brachiopods,
crinoids, echinoids, bryozoans, gastropods, foraminifers, sponges, ostracodes, trilobites, scolecodonts, bivalves
and fish teeth and scales. The studied interval is characterized by moderate to high levels of bioturbation.
Burrows are common in the packstones and wackestones. The predominant trace fossil observed was classified
as Thalassinoides, occurring mainly in the packstones and wackstones. Zoophycos occurs less commonly, in the
mudstones and packstones. Because of the presence at the conodonts Neognathodus atokaensis and Idiognathodus
incurvus, it is possible to suggest an Atokan age for the analyzed interval. The associated fauna, bioturbation,
and lithology suggests shallow, nearshore waters, with mudstones of low-energy, wackestones and packstones
of moderate-energy, and grainstones of relatively high-energy marine conditions.

Key words: Conodonts, Morrowan, Atokan, Amazonas Basin, biostratigraphy.

RESUMO – Este estudo tem por objetivo analisar a fauna de conodontes na região sul da Bacia do Amazonas,
compreendendo a porção mais inferior da Formação Itaituba e, através desses organismos, refinar a idade
sugerida para este intervalo, discutindo o limite Morrowano-Atokano nesta região. A área de estudo é represen-
tada por duas pedreiras de calcário, denominadas informalmente como 1 e 2, exploradas pela indústria de cimento
CAIMA. Dentre os conodontes encontrados estão: Idiognathodus incurvus, Idiognathoides sinuatus,
Neognathodus roundyi, N. atokaensis, N. medadultimus, N. bassleri, Diplognathodus coloradoensis, Adetognathus
lautus, Hindeodus minutus e Idioprioniodus sp. Foi aqui informalmente proposta uma zona de ocorrência de
Idiognathoides sinuatus e uma subzona de ocorrência de Neognathodus roundyi. Os conodontes ocorrem predo-
minantemente nos packstones e secundariamente nos wackestones e mudstones. A Formação Itaituba é o inter-
valo mais abundante em fósseis do Pensilvaniano da Bacia do Amazonas, com espessos pacotes de carbonatos
marinhos ricos em organismos de fauna marinha normal, sendo composta por braquiópodes, gastrópodes, crinóides,
briozoários, foraminíferos, ostracodes, trilobitas, escolecodontes, dentes de peixes e fragmentos orgânicos. O
intervalo estudado é caracterizado por níveis de moderada a alta bioturbação. As bioturbações são freqüentes nos
packstones e wackestones. O traço fóssil predominante foi classificado como icnogênero Thalassinoides, ocor-
rendo principalmente nos packstones e wackstones e Zoophycos, ocorrendo secundariamente em mudstones e
packstones. Os conodontes estudados, principalmente Neognathodus atokaensis e Idiognathodus incurvus,
sugerem uma idade Atokana para o intervalo analisado. Além disso, a fauna associada, bioturbação e caracteres
litológicos descritos, atestam um ambiente de água rasa, proximal, com mudstones de energia baixa, wackestones
e packstones de energia moderada e grainstones de energia relativamente alta.

INTRODUCTION

The Pennsylvanian Itaituba Formation has the thickest
marine carbonate deposits and the richest preservation of
marine organisms of the Amazonas Basin. This formation
has been intensively studied in terms of its sedimentary
deposits and fossil constituents. The study area is located
in the Amazonas Basin, northern Brazil. It comprises two
calcareous quarries situated 30 km of Itaituba city,
corresponding to the map locations 1 and 2 (Figure 1).

Preliminary studies regarding the fossil assemblages
were undertaken to determine the systematic classification,
the biostratigraphic range and correlation of the conodont
group (Lemos, 1990; Lemos &amp;amp; Medeiros, 1996; Scomazzon,
1999, among others).

T h i s  w o r k  a i m s  t o  d e s c r i b e  t h e  c o n o d o n t s  a n d
associated fauna of two calcareous quarries in the lower
part of the Itaituba Formation, Pennsylvanian of the Ama-
zonas Basin. The studied conodonts are characteristic of
the early Pennsylvanian, Morrowan and Atokan stages
and have been used to biostratigraphically refine the
Carboniferous of the Amazonas Basin. The study involves
the establishment of one informal biostratigraphic taxon-
range zone and one subzone, and determination of the
paleoecological conditions in which these microfossils
were deposited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Seventy-five samples, totalling thirty-seven kg of rocks,
mainly carbonates, were processed for the study of
conodonts. The laboratory techniques followed the
methodology of Austin (1987).

In addition, 15 carbonates thin-sections from quarry
1 and 12 thin-sections from quarry 2 were prepared.  From
the thin-sections the associated fauna was described and

GEOLOGIC SETTING

The Amazonas Basin is a large intracratonic sedimentary
basin occupying 500,000 km2 within the northern Brazilian
states of Amazonas and Pará. Its strata cover the Precambrian
provinces of the Guyanas Shield to the north and the Guaporé
Shield to the south. To the east, it is separated from the
Marajó Basin by the Gurupá Arch. To the west, is separated
from Solimões Basin by a subsurface basement-high, the N-
S trending Purus Arch. In its depocenter, the basin preserves
a stratigraphic record up to 5,000 m thick deposited from
Proterozoic through Tertiary time. The Carboniferous-Permian
strata accounts for more than half of the total thickness (Milani
&amp;amp; Zalán, 1998).

 In structural and depositional terms, the Amazonas
Basin is divisible into three distinct sectors, a northern

plataform, a southern platform, and a deep central basin
area. These trend generally east-west, and evolved
geologically for 500 Ma. Along both the northern and
southern boundaries of the basin are outcrops of Paleozoic
rock.

The stratigraphic framework of the Amazonas Basin
includes three Paleozoic units covered by Cretaceous to
Recent continental clastics (Cunha et al., 1994): the
Ordovician – Devonian Unit, Devonian – Mississippian Unit,
and Pennsylvanian – Permian Unit. The latter unit
accumulated following intense erosion caused by the early
Hercynian Orogenic episode. It represents a transgressive
to regressive cycle from the Pennsylvanian through the
Permian time associated with significant climatic changes from
cold to warm and arid (Scotese &amp;amp; Mckerrow, 1990). This cycle
corresponds to the rocks of the Tapajós Group, which consists
of four conformable formations, in ascending order the Mon-
te Alegre, Itaituba, Nova Olinda and Andirá formations (Cu-
nha et al., 1994).

The Itaituba Formation overlies the Monte Alegre
Formation. The Monte Alegre is considered to be late
Morrowan-Atokan in age. The Itaituba varies from 110 m
thick in the southern outcrop area to 420 m thick in the
central part of the basin. The dominant lithologies include
mainly intercalated carbonates and evaporates, and
secondarily, clastics. A diverse marine fauna with Andean
and U.S. Midcontinent affinities characterizes the carbonate
units, and are the richest known from the Amazonas Basin.
Groups represented include foraminifers, corals, bryozoans,
crinoids, trilobites, ostracodes, gastropods, brachiopods,
scolecodonts, fish remains and conodonts. Shale and
siltstone beds often contain crustaceans and plants
indicative of episodic freshwater deposition and are
interpreted as shallow marine subtidal to supratidal
e n v i r o n m e n t s .  T h e  I t a i t u b a  F o r m a t i o n  i s  o v e r l a i d
conformably by the Nova Olinda Formation of Atokan-early
Desmoinesian age.

 Age estimations of the Itaituba Formation have been
based on microfossil assemblages, including spores and
pollen (Playford &amp;amp; Dino, 2000), fusulinids (Altiner &amp;amp; Savini,
1995), and conodonts (Lemos, 1990, 1992a,b; Neis, 1996,
Scomazzon, 1999), but they are controversial.

CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

The first discussion of the conodont biostratigraphy
in the Amazonas Basin based on multielement taxonomy
was made by Lemos (1990, 1992 a,b), followed by Lemos
&amp;amp; Medeiros (1996), Neis (1996), Scomazzon (1999), and
Lemos &amp;amp; Scomazzon (2001), each analyzing different
areas in the Amazonas region.

Lemos (1990) described three assemblage zones:
N e o g n a t h o d u s  s y m m e t r i c u s / R h a c h i s t o g n a t h u s
muricatus, Diplognathodus orphanus/D. coloradoensis;
and S t r e p t o g n a t h o d u s  e l o n g a t u s / I d i o g n a t h o d u s
ellisoni. The first zone contains R.  muricatus and N.

gre Formation and lower part of the Itaituba Formation.
The second zone contains D. orphanus, which is typical
of the Atokan, and Diplognathodus coloradoensis,
typical of the early Desmoinesian, and were recovered
from the middle part of the Itaituba Formation. The
third zone is characterized by S.  elongatus and I.
ellisoni, which were interpreted to be of Middle-Late
Pennsylvanian age, recovered from the Nova Olinda
Formation.

Neis (1996) suggested two zones: Idiognathoides
ouachitensis/Rhachistognathus muricatus; and
Diplognathodus spp. The first zone is typical of Morrowan
age rocks, with Rhachistognathus muricatus and
Idiognathoides ouachitensis. The second zone, with
Diplognathodus suggests an Atokan age. The conodont
associations studied by Neis (1996) suggest a late Morrowan
to middle Atokan age for this interval in the Itaituba
Formation.

Scomazzon (1999), who also studied the Itaituba
Formation, suggested three interval zones: Idiognathodus
sinuosus/Rhachistognathus muricatus - late Morrowan;
Idiognathodus klapperi/Streptognathodus parvus - late
Morrowan-Atokan; and Idiognathodus claviformis/
Idiognathodus incurvus - early Desmoinesian.

Lemos &amp;amp; Scomazzon (2001) redesignated the third
zone of Lemos (1990), formerly the Streptognathodus
e l o n g a t u s / I d i o g n a t h o d u s  e l l i s o n i  z o n e ,  a s  t h e
Idiognathodus claviformis/Idiognathodus incurvus
zone.

The conodont fauna analyzed herein comprises
twenty-four specimens collected from quarry 1 (Table

ZONATION

It is herein proposed one informal taxon-range zone
and one subzone, respectively: Idiognathoides sinuatus
zone and Neognathodus roundyi subzone.

Idiognathoides sinuatus Zone
The Idiognathoides sinuatus zone extends from the

lower part of quarry 1 to the upper part of the quarry 2,
and is recognized by the occurrence of I. sinuatus. The
associated fauna comprises abundant Idiognathodus

incurvus and Neognathodus spp., and less common
Diplognathodus coloradoensis, Idioprioniodus sp.,
Hindeodus minutus and Adetognathus lautus (Figure 3).

According to Manger &amp;amp; Sutherland (1984), I.  sinuatus
is characteristic of the Morrowan age, although it ranges
into the Atokan. Idiognathoides sinuatus is very common
in both quarries 1and 2, totalling thirty-five specimens.
The occurrence of I. sinuatus might suggest a Morrowan
age for this interval, but the presence of I.  incurvus in
the lower strata of quarry 1 indicates an Atokan age.
Idiognathodus incurvus is an excellent Atokan index for
the Atokan and is abundant in both quarries. It is not
recommended as a zone marker here because many
specimens are probably juveniles. According to Merrill
&amp;amp; von Bitter (1976), D. coloradoensis occurs from
Morrowan to early Desmoinesian, being typical of late
Atokan. Two specimens of D. coloradoensis were found
near the top of quarry 1.

Neognathodus roundyi Subzone
The Neognathodus roundyi subzone is recognized

by the local occurrence of this species in the basal portion
of quarry 2. This subzone contains Neognathodus
medadultimus and N. atokaensis. The conodont fauna
is characterized by N.  roundyi, Idiognathoides sinuatus,
I d i o g n a t h o d u s  i n c u r v u s ,  H i n d e o d u s  m i n u t u s  a n d
Adetognathus lautus.

Grayson &amp;amp; Lambert (1987) suggest that Neognathodus
is the most important conodont genus for biostratigraphy
of Early-Middle Pennsylvanian strata. Neognathodus is
abundant in quarry 2, where 21 specimens were collected.
Neognathodus atokaensis, considered an index fossil for
the Atokan, was collected in the lower part of quarry 2.

M a n g e r  &amp;amp;  S u t h e r l a n d  ( 1 9 8 4 ) ,  w o r k i n g  t h e
biostratigraphy of the Morrowan - Atokan boundary in
Texas, studied an assemblage composed mainly of N.
medadultimus and N. roundyi. They suggest an Atokan-
early Desmoinesian age for the strata studied. The same
species were observed in quarry 2, with N. roundyi most
abundant in the lower portion of quarry 2, from which we
named the zone.

According to the presence of N. atokaensis, N.
m e d a d u l t i m u s a n d  N .  r o u n d y i,  t h e  f o r m e r  s p e c i e s
restricted to Atokan age and the latter two typical of
the Atokan-early Desmoinesian age, it is possible to
suggest an Atokan age to the lower part of quarry 2,
which includes the N.  roundyi zone.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

The two quarries are mainly composed of interbedded
fossiliferous carbonates, subordinate shales and nodular
a n h y d r i t e .  To  c o m p l e m e n t  t h e  p a l e o e c o l o g i a l

interval analyzed. These environments are mainly
characterized by differences in water energy, depth,
consistency of the substrate and faunal composition.

Intertidal environment
Represented by moderate to high energy grainstones.

Peloidal Grainstone are composed of pellets, crinoids and
fusulinacean foraminifers. This microfacies characterizes
moderate energy conditions. Bioclastic grainstones are

b r a c h i o p o d s ,  b r y o z o a n s ,  f o r a m i n i f e r s ,  o s t r a c o d e s ,
trilobites, crinoids and echinoids; sparse ooids and pellets
can be found. Bioturbation and sparry cement are common
features. This microfacies characterizes high energy
conditions. Oolitic grainstones are composed of non-
skeletal, allochthonous components, generally quartz
grains with micritic envelopes. Sparry cement is commonly
present. Rare oncoids with crinoidal nuclei and pellets can
be found, and bioturbation is common. These microfacies
characterize high energy conditions.

Subtidal environment
R e p r e s e n t e d  b y  b i o c l a s t i c  w a c k e s t o n e s  a n d

packstones. These microfacies represent normal marine
bottom conditions and are composed of bioclasts from
a normal marine fauna. Mudstones with gastropods
correspond to a restricted microfacies and is composed
of bioclasts of gastropods floating in a micritic matrix.
Secondarily ostracodes, foraminifers, brachiopods and
crinoids are present. Bioclasts do not show preferential
orientation. This microfacies suggests a muddy low
energy depositional environment, probably in a back

shoal. Bioclastic wackestones are composed of bioclasts
from normal marine fauna, such as fibrous and prismatic
brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, bivalves, bryozoans,
foraminifers, trilobites and ostracodes. Bioturbation is
common. Bioclastic packstones are the most common

Pennsylvanian in the Amazonas Basin. The bioclastic
constituents represent a normal marine fauna, including
brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids, bivalves, bryozoans,
foraminifers, trilobites and ostracodes. Bioturbation is
common. The orientation of the bioclasts suggests that
these sediments were deposited in settings affected by
normal waves, under some energetic conditions, but
insufficient to remove the matrix, which suggests a
subtidal environment.

The conodonts
The conodont fauna characterized by Idiognathodus,

Idiognathoides and Neognathodus occurs widely in both
quarries in the bioclastic packstones of the subtidal
environment.

Davis &amp;amp; Webster (1985) studied biofacies represented
b y  I d i o g n a t h o d u s ,  I d i o g n a t h o i d e s  a n d
Declinognathodus, and suggested that these conodonts
represent shallow marine, subtidal deposits with muddy
substracte, low to moderate energy and normal salinity.
Neognathodus biofacies generally represent lagoon
deposits characterized by calcareous mudstones and
common co-occurrence with Adetognathus or with
Idiognathodus in shallow waters. Adetognathus biofacies
typically represent more shallow waters of intertidal to
lagoon deposits, characterized by moderate to high
energy and high salinity conditions.

A c c o r d i n g  t o  D u n n  ( 1 9 7 6 ) ,  D i p l o g n a t h o d u s
coloradoensis is usually common in shallow marine
waters, with relatively high energy conditions. Elements
of D. coloradoensis were found in only one level of
quarry 1, associated with Adetognathus lautus.

In quarry 1, the predominant occurrence of bioclastic
packstones and Idiognathodus  and Idiognathoides
suggest an environment of shallow waters with low to
moderate energy, which grades to more shallow and
moderate to high energy in the lower part of quarry 2

with the presence of Neognathodus associated with
Adetognathus. The presence of Idiognathodus and
Idiognathoides through the lower to upper levels of the

quarry 2 suggests a return of shallow water with low to
moderate energy conditions.

According to some authors (Merrill &amp;amp; von Bitter, 1976)

04_Art03_Nascimento.pmd 28/11/2005, 09:49199



REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 8(3), 2005200

Table 2. Conodont distribution in quarry 2.

Hindeodus and Idioprioniodus are more abundant in deep
waters. Idioprioniodus was rare in the basal strata of
quarry 1, and absent in the quarry 2. Hindeodus is also
rare in both quarries, suggesting that the studied interval
represents shallow waters.

Thus, according to field description, facies analyses,
environmental characteristics and conodont fauna, we
suggest a general transgressive episode through quarry
1, grading to a regressive episode in the lower part of
quarry 2, which shifted to transgressive deposits through
the rest of quarry 2.

The associated fauna

containing normal marine organisms in the Pennsylvanian
of Amazonas Basin. The associated fauna in the studied
quarries contain brachiopods, crinoids, echinoids,
b r y o z o a n s ,  g a s t r o p o d s ,  f o r a m i n i f e r s ,  s p o n g e s ,
ostracodes, trilobites, scolecodonts, bivalves and teeth
fish fragments. The brachiopods are the most abundant

group, represented mainly by the Productida Order.
Secondarily abundant are fish teeth and scales, mainly
actinopterygians of the Paleonisciforms Order. In the
studied material specimens of the Acanthodii and
Chondrichthyes Classes (identified by Dr. Martha Richter,
an expert in fossil fish) were recovered.

The associated fauna represents normal marine
bottom conditions, with relatively shallow, quiet and
warm waters, and muddy substrate suggesting subtidal
environmental deposition. The occurrence of fragmented
organic material in the lower levels of quarry 2 (P2 0 C0,
P2 10 C1, P2 30 C2 and P2 71 C3/6) suggest possible
reworking by currents and/or bioturbation in moderate
energy conditions. The presence of bryozoans, crinoids

The material studied is characterized by moderate to high

and wackestones. The predominant trace fossil observed

sediment, but the probable trace-maker was a general shrimp-
like animal, adapted to live in environments with variable
levels of oxygenation and salinity. Zoophycos is the second
ichnogenus described, occurring mainly in mudstones and
secondarily in packstones.

According to Doyle et al. (1994), the distribution of
Thalassinoides ranges from intertidal to supratidal, low
to moderate energy, nutrient-rich and dysaerobic settings,
while Zoophycos is restricted to subtidal low energy,
disaerobic and soft substrate environments.

CONCLUSIONS

Conodonts from the two quarries comprising strata
of the lower Itaituba Formation, Amazonas Basin, were
studied to refine the suggested age of this area and to

Diplognathodus coloradoensis, Hindeodus minutus,
Idioprioniodus sp. and Adetognathus lautus in quarry
1, and I. sinuatus, I. incurvus, Neognathodus roundyi,
N. medadultimus, N. atokaensis, N. bassleri, H.  minutus
and A. lautus in quarry 2.

Idiognathodus, Idiognathoides and Neognathodus
are the most abundant genera. In the carbonates of quarry

Diplognathodus, Hindeodus and Adetognathus.

In quarry 2 Idiognathodus and Idiognathoides were
recovered in great abundance, and the first appearance
of Neognathodus is in the basal strata of this quarry,

medadultimus and N. roundyi, typical of Atokan-early
Desmoinesian age. Conodonts were mainly found in the
p a c k s t o n e s  a n d  s e c o n d a r i l y  i n  w a c k e s t o n e s  a n d
mudstones.

One taxon-range zone and one subzone are informally
p r o p o s e d :  I d i o g n a t h o i d e s  s i n u a t u s  z o n e ,  a n d
Neognathodus roundyi subzone. The I. sinuatus zone
extends from the lower part of the quarry 1 to the upper
part of quarry 2, and recognized by the local occurrence of
the nominate species. The conodont fauna comprises the
index species Idiognathoides sinuatus, Idiognathodus
incurvus, Diplognathodus coloradoensis, Idioprioniodus
sp., Hindeodus minutus and Adetognathus lautus. The N.
roundyi subzone is recognized by the local occurrence
of N. roundyi in the lower part of quarry 2. The conodont
fauna is characterized by N. roundyi, N. medadultimus,
N. atokaensis, I.  sinuatus, I. incurvus, H. minutus and A.
lautus.

The Itaituba Formation is the richest interval containing
normal marine organisms in the Pennsylvanian of the Ama-
zonas Basin. The associated fauna contains brachiopods,
crinoids, echinoids, bryozoans, gastropods, foraminifers,
sponges, ostracodes, trilobites, scolecodonts, bivalves

and fish teeth and scales. The presence in both quarries

conditions as warm and clean waters. The conodonts,
associated fauna and facies analysis suggest relatively
shallow, quiet and warm waters, with muddy substrates in
a subtidal setting. At a larger depositional scale, a general
t r a n g r e s s i v e - r e g r e s s i v e - t r a n g r e s s i v e  e p i s o d e ,
characterizes these Atokan age deposits.
