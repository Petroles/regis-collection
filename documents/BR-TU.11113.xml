ABSTRACT: In view of the diversity of environments found in 
the Brazilian territory, it is understandable that the use of native 
species can provide more relevant information for ecotoxicological 
studies. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the quality of water 
samples from the Atibaia River in an area that is under the influence 
of petroleum refinery using a native test-organism and submitting 
the data to PCA statistical analysis. Therefore, acute toxicity assays 
with Lecane bulla (Rotifera) were performed in four locations of 
the river, as well as physical-chemical analyses. Sampling was drawn 
in the dry and rainy seasons. The bioassays were static and lasted 
48 hours; dead organisms were quantified at the end of the tests. 
Toxicological differences among the samples/per location and control 
were compared by means of the Analysis of Variance. Physical-
chemical and mortality variables were simultaneously analyzed by 
multivariate analysis of the principal components and the Pearson 
correlation coefficient. Water samples from the exit of the refinery 
stabilization pond (location S.1) were toxic to L. bulla in both 
seasons, with significant differences in relation to the control and 
between the seasons. The statistical treatment of data showed that 
mortality was strong and positively correlated with total hardness, 
chlorides and EC, which together with pH presented higher values in 
location S.1, in the dry and in the rainy seasons. Due to its sensibility 
to the quality of the Atibaia river water samples, the potential use of 
L. bulla for ecotoxicological studies as an alternative test organism 
could be demonstrated.

KEYWORDS: multivariate analysis; PCA; bioassays; acute toxicity;

RESUMO: Em virtude da diversidade de ambientes encontrada no 
território nacional, o uso de espécies nativas em estudos toxicológicos 
constitui assunto de extrema relevância. Este trabalho objetivou avaliar 
a qualidade das águas do rio Atibaia, em uma região sob influência de 
uma refinaria de petróleo utilizando-se um organismo-teste nativo, e 
aplicando-se o método estatístico multivariado análise de componentes 
principais (PCA). Ensaios de toxicidade aguda com o rotífero Lecane 
bulla (Rotifera) e análises físico-químicas foram realizados com amostras 
obtidas em quatro diferentes pontos do rio em questão. As amostragens 
ocorreram nas estações seca e chuvosa. Os bioensaios foram estáticos 
e duraram 48 horas; organismos mortos foram quantificados no final 
dos testes. Diferenças toxicológicas entre as amostras de cada ponto e o 
controle foram comparadas por análise de variância. As variáveis físico-
-químicas e a mortalidade foram simultaneamente submetidas à análise 
multivariada dos componentes principais e pela correlação de Pearson. 
Amostras de água retiradas da saída da lagoa de estabilização (ponto S.1) 
foram tóxicas ao organismo L. bulla nas duas estações, com diferenças 
significativas em relação ao controle e entre as estações. O tratamento 
estatístico dos dados demonstrou que a mortalidade correlacionou-se 
forte e positivamente com parâmetros como dureza total, cloretos e EC, 
e, com o pH, apresentou valores maiores no ponto S.1 em ambas as 
estações. A sensibilidade apresentada pela espécie L. bulla em relação à 
qualidade das amostras da água do rio Atibaia indicou que este organis-
mo apresenta potencial de uso para estudos de ecotoxicologia, podendo 
ser futuramente empregado como organismo-teste alternativo.

INTRODUCTION

The Atibaia River runs through a large industrial and me-
tropolitan area and several cities use the waters of this 
river as source of public water supply. Along its cour-
se, the river receives discharges of urban sewage and ef-
fluents of many industries, including a petroleum refinery 
(Hoshina et al., 2008).

Ecotoxicological assays aiming at monitoring bodies of 
water generally use internationally standardized exotic species. 
It is known, however, that determining such toxic levels us-
ing native species would provide the ecotoxicological studies 
with higher representation and reliability. Rotifers prove to 
be a suitable alternative for test organisms, since they present 
parthenogenetic reproduction, short life cycle and gestation 
periods, besides occurring in Brazilian aquatic ecosystems. 

The abundance of rotifers shows how important they 
are as one of the largest groups of freshwater zooplanktons in 
limnological studies, together with Cladocera (Anomopoda) 
and Copepoda. They make up organisms that are frequently 
used in aquaculture and are strongly connected with aquatic 
habitats in virtually all of their active stages, and only their 
resting stages are drought-resistant (Segers, 2008)

In a water quality assessment, different approaches can 
be used, including chemical analysis and toxicity tests. When 
applied individually, they can lead to great uncertainties; 
however, if used together, they generate safer data on envi-
ronmental conditions (César et al., 2007). The use of mul-
tivariate analysis comes as a valuable tool for interpreting the 
obtained environmental data. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) provides information about the most significant pa-
rameters which describe all the interpretation of the mass of 
data, data reduction, besides summarizing the statistical cor-
relation among constituents in the water with minimum loss 
of the original information (Helena et al., 2000).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality of 
the Atibaia River using the rotifer Lecane bulla as an indica-
tor-organism, showing its potential for this use. The principal 
component analysis was performed to show the parameters 
measured in the water that might interfere with the same 
quality and mortality of the rotifer. This kind of analysis aims 
at identifying the variables that better explain seasonal and 
temporal variations and the relationship between them.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sampling

Water samples were collected close to a petroleum refinery in 
the state of São Paulo, as follows: site (S.1) corresponds to the 
output of the stabilization pond effluent from the petroleum 

refinery, biologically treated, stabilized for about seven days 
and discarded in the Atibaia River; site (S.2) 200  m ups-
tream of the discharge of effluents refinery stabilization pond; 
site  (S.3)  200  m downstream from the effluent disposal; 
and  site (S.4) 800 m downstream from discharge, as shown 
in Table 1. Sampling was conducted during Brazil’s dry (April, 
May, June and August, 2008) and rainy (October, December, 
2008 and Februbary, 2009) seasons. All samples were stored at 
4ºC up until the moment the assays were carried out.

Water quality analyses
Physical-chemical analyses were carried out using the metho-
dology described by the Standard Methods (Clesceri et al., 
1998). The analyzed parameters were hydrogenionic poten-
tial (pH), electrical conductivity (EC) in µS/cm, dissolved 
oxygen (DO) in mg/L of O2, total hardness in mg/L CaCO3, 
apparent color in Pt-CO/L and chlorides in mg/L of Cl-1. 
Previous analyses on ammonia concentration of the studied 
sites (data not shown) were found between 2.28 – 2.65 mg/L 
with no statistical influence on the living organisms.

Test organism
L. bulla was obtained in Lobo-Broa Reservoir (Itirapina, Brotas, 
SP; 22º15’S, 47º49’W), bred in laboratory, being fed with mi-
croalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata containing approxima-
tely 1 x 106 cells/mL. The animals were kept in clean places with 
no substance or toxic vapor, under a 16-hour photoperiod and 
an 8-hour darkness at a thermoperiod of 20 ± 2ºC. Breeding 
and test were carried out with dilution water, which had pH 
between 7.4 ± 0.2, total hardness of 44 ± 4 mg/L in CaCO3 and 
EC of approximately 160 µS/cm.

Sensitivity test of L. bulla 
to a reference toxicant
Tests were conducted using juvenile rotifers. There is a clear dis-
tinction in size between adults and juvenile rotifers. Thus rotifers 
that appeared much smaller in size in comparison to full-fledged 
adults were collected and used directly in the testing.

Evaluation of the Atibaia River water quality using Lecane bulla as a test organism

 A light intensity of 600 lux, a light cycle of 16-hour 
light and 8-hour dark, and a temperature of 20.0 ± 2ºC was 
used in all tests, which were conducted in two well culture 
plates with a test well volume of 1 mL. Juvenile rotifers were 
transferred from their culture dishes to each test well us-
ing a glass micropipette so that there were animals in each 
well, the ones that had previously been fasting for 48 hours. 
Rotifers were transferred under a stereoscope (used at 40X 
magnification). Dilution water transferred with the rotifers 
was drained from each well with the use of a glass micropi-
pette, and test solutions were added to the wells. 

Stock solutions were serially diluted with dilution water 
to achieve the required test concentrations. A definitive toxic-
ity test was undertaken using 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5 and 10.5 mg/L 
cadmium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%). Testing also 
included a negative control (dilution water only, 0 mg/L cadmi-
um chloride). Ten replicates were used for each concentration.

After a 24-hour exposure period, mortality was recorded 
for each well. Rotifers were considered dead if they were not 
moving. Tests were accepted if there was at least 90% sur-
vival in the controls.

The LC50 value was calculated using JSPEAR, the 
Trimmed Spearman-Karber method (Hamilton et  al., 
1977). Thereafter, rotifers were exposed to this calculated 
LC50 concentration on a further ten occasions over an elev-
en-month period. 

Acute toxicity test 
using L. bulla as test organism
Toxicity tests were performed using the same methodology 
for testing for sensitivity to cadmium chloride, by 48 hours 
of exposure to the Atibaia River water samples. Twelve repli-
cates were used for each sampling. 

Statistical analysis
L. bulla mortality data was statistically analyzed on the R 
platform (R Development Core Team, 2009). By means of 
the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), considering the inte-
raction of seasonal effects on factorial experiments, toxicity 
differences of sampled locations were compared with the 
control carried out in the dry season, which did not pre-
sent mortality rate as in the rainy season. The data regarding 
physical-chemical variables, along with toxicity data, under-
went a multivariate analysis of PCA using the aforementio-
ned software. The multivariate factor analysis is an analytical 
technique resulting from a set of uncorrelated variables called 
factors, which explain the variation observed in the original 
set (Anazawa; Ohmori, 2005; Brown, 1998). Correlated 
analyses were developed for combined data of all sample lo-
cations for physical-chemical variables and mortality, which 
were calculated with the Pearson correlation coefficient.

RESULTS

Physical-chemical variables in the Atibaia River waters analy-
zed in the four sample locations (S.1; S.2; S.3 and S.4) in the 
dry and rainy seasons can be found in Table 2. 

 In all sample locations, the color variable presented 
concentrations above the water quality standards for Class 
II Rivers — CONAMA Resolution n. 357/05 (CONAMA, 
2005) — and all of the values recommended by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water quality 
(Who, 2004). The same was observed for DO values in lo-
cations S.2 and S.4 in the rainy season, and for chloride in 
location S.1 in both seasons. Total hardness parameters, EC, 
pH and chlorides presented higher values for location S.1 in 
comparison to the others in both seasons. 

The 24-h LC50 average was calculated to be 3.86 mg/L 
cadmium chloride, which suggests the rotifers used in this 
study are reasonably tolerant to cadmium chloride.

The mean mortality rate of L. bulla was higher in 
the rainy season for all ocations but S.4. The highest 
mean mortality rates were found in location S.1 in both 
seasons (Fig. 1). 

The Analysis of Variance results verified the influence of 
the location on mortality; S.1 and S.4 presented differences 
from the control (p = 0.00264; p = 0.00324). Seasonal ef-
fects were verified only for location 1 (p = 0.0148). 

The correlation coefficient of the seven analyzed vari-
ables (Table 3) distinguished several relevant relationships 
(indicated by underlined values):
•	 strong,	positive	correlation	between	total	hardness,	pH,	

chlorides and EC (r = 0.71 – 1.0) was attributed to con-
tributions of residuary waters;

•	 strong,	negative	correlation	between	color	and	pH,	co-
lor and OD (r = -0.88 – 0.91);

•	 high	positive	correlation	between	pH	and	DO,	pH	and	
chlorides (r = 0.68 – 0.72); d) mortality rate was stron-
gly and positively correlated with total hardness, chlori-
des and EC (r = 0.51 – 0.73). Concentrations of most 
physical-chemical parameters were highly correlated.

Analyses of PCA were simultaneously applied to physical-
chemical and ecotoxicological data of surface water, from the 
four sampling locations, in order to extract the main factors 
corresponding to the different variation sources in water qual-
ity; the purpose was to determine the main controls for as-
sessing surface water. The results obtained from the two main 
factors of PCA showed significant associations of different 
variants. Liu et  al. (2003) classified load factors as ‘strong’, 
‘moderate’ and ‘weak’ corresponding to the absolute load val-
ues &gt;  0.75, 0.75 – 0.50 and 0.50 – 0.30, respectively. Both 
factors explained 86.21% of the variance in the set of original 
data, which was considered very good, and capable of identi-
fying the main variance sources of the analyzed parameters.

The first main factor was prevalent and represented 64.21% of 
total variance, with strong positive loads of total hardness, EC, 
pH and chlorides; and a strong negative load for color, indi-
cating an intense correlation with these parameters, and mod-
erate positive loads for mortality and DO. This can be attrib-
uted to a mineral component of the river water and could be 
called a “geogenic” factor. The second main factor represented 
26.0% of total variance, showing a strong negative load for 
DO, and moderate positive loads for mortality rate and color, 
so that it could be called “anthropogenic factor” (Table 4).

With the aim of identifying seasonal and spatial tenden-
cies of the concentration, the sampling locations were plotted 
(Fig. 2). A line over the ordinal plan showed that the samples in 
the rainy season tended to converge towards the upper left part 
of the plan, where the variables color and mortality had higher 
relative importance for the y-axis in this region; and along the 
x-axis there was high correlation with color, except for location 
S.1, presented in the upper right part, in which the variables 
pH, EC, total hardness and chlorides better explained its loca-
tion in the x-axis. The samples in the dry season were located in 
the lower part, slightly directed towards the left, where greater 

importance was placed to DO in relation to the y-axis and to-
wards color in the x-axis. Location S.1, however, was presented 
in the upper right part, in which the variables pH, EC, total 
hardness and chlorides better explain its location in the x-axis.

since it presented higher values than the other locations. 
The EC values were attributed to the mineral content in all 
sampled locations, in which ion concentrations were higher. 

The values of pH in the collected water samples met the 
6.5 – 8.5 standards specified by the WHO (WHO, 2004). 

The highest chloride concentrations were found in loca-
tion 1. Such values were higher than the ones recommended 
by WHO and CONAMA 357/05, which suggest concentra-
tions that are lower than 250 mg/L of Cl. The concentrations 
in the dry season were higher than those in the rainy season. 

Total hardness presented high concentrations in location 
S.1, being the concentrations in the dry season higher than 
the ones in the rainy season. High values of hardness may af-
fect acceptability in water consumption concerning taste and 
deposition levels; however, ecological and epidemiological 
studies have shown inverse relationships between the water 
hardness and cardiovascular diseases (WHO 2004).

DO levels in locations S.2 and S.4 in the rainy season 
were in disagreement with CONAMA 357/05, which rec-
ommend DO values higher than 5 mg/L of O2. Oxygen con-
centration monitoring in the aquatic system is important for 
the biological, chemical and physical systems. The variables 
involved in both the increase and the decrease of oxygen lev-
els in the river water are so numerous and complex that there 
is no model capable of being used without carrying out a 
careful analysis of local characteristics. 

Color results were high in all sample locations – higher 
than the 15 and 75 mg/L limits established by WHO and 
CONAMA 375/05, respectively, being the highest values 
found in the rainy season. Color is generally caused by the 
presence of organic matter (mainly humic and fulvic acids), 
especially associated with the fractions of humus found in 
soils of river banks. Color is also strongly influenced by the 
presence of iron salts and other metals, which might indicate 
sources of water contamination with industrial effluents and, 
consequently, a risky situation (WHO, 2004). 

The results of susceptibility testing with CdCl2 is higher 
than those found by Nandini et al. (2007), who reported a 24 
LC50 of 0.19 mg/L for the freshwater rotifer Brachionus mac-
racanthus, but lower than that reported for the water frog Rana 
ridibunda a 96 h LC50 of 51.2 mg/L (Selvi et al., 2003), and 
that determined for guppy Poecilia reticulata the 96 h LC50, 
30.4 mg/L in a static bioassay test system, and 30.6 mg/L with 
Behrens–Karber’s method (Yilmaz et al., 2004).

Surface water samples from location S.1 proved to be 
highly toxic for L. bulla in both seasons, presenting signifi-
cant differences from the control by the ANOVA, as well as 
significant toxicity differences for this location between the 
two seasons. Values in this location were found higher than 
the ones recommended by WHO and CONAMA 357/05 for 
physical-chemical parameters of color and chlorides, besides 
presenting higher pH, EC and total hardness values. Location 
S.4 also showed significant differences in relation to control;

When it comes to spatial distribution, scoring parts for the 
sample locations were better explained by factor 1 (y-axis), in 
which the variables pH, EC, total hardness, chlorides and color 
presented higher loads. Locations S.2, S.3 and S.4 were near the 
left axis, with high correlation with color, whereas location S.1 
was located next to the right side of the axis, having a high cor-
relation with the variables pH, EC, total hardness and chlorides.

DISCUSSION

High levels of EC, due to the significant amount of dissolved 
salts, were observed in all river locations in both dry and rainy 
seasons during the study; location 1, though, was in evidence, 



66 Arq. Inst. Biol., São Paulo, v.82, p. 1-7, 2015

however, seasonal variation was not significant. The other lo-
cations did not show significant differences from the control 
or between the dry and the rainy seasons. Water toxicity of this 
area might be due to effluent inputs from fertilizer industries, 
petrol refineries and chemical companies located in the region. 

The correlation analysis supported these results, since 
strong positive correlation was found between mortality rates 
and total hardness, chlorides and EC and between the vari-
ables themselves, which can reflect the inflow of either sedi-
ments or others related to anthropogenic activities. Strong, 
negative correlation between color and pH, color and DO 
may indicate contamination by organic matter from house-
holds, agriculture, industries or discharges of other pollut-
ants into industrial effluents. However, color and DO slight-
ly correlated with total hardness, chlorides and EC, which 
may suggest different or multiple sources. 

There are several studies in which the PCA is used to in-
tegrate environmental physical-chemical data with toxicity pa-
rameters (César et al., 2007; Riba et al., 2004a, b; Delvalls 
et al., 2002; Delvalls; Chapman, 1998). The results of both 
the PCA and the Pearson correlations showed strong relation-
ship between variables that may have a common source of 
inflow in the field of study. Color, DO and pH association is 
mainly connected with anthropogenic activities. Chloride, total 
hardness and EC association is attributed to high salt discharges 
from industrial effluents or to the elements on rocky materials. 

The first factor (F1) shows environmental degradation 
related to some parameters that show the presence of salt (to-
tal hardness, EC, pH and chlorides), since such variables were 
moderately linked to toxicity by the analysis of PCA. Toxicity 
data for L. bulla was also moderately associated with the sec-
ond factor (F2), along with color and DO, meaning that the 
high level of color and the low level of DO are leading to 
environmental degradation in the places where this factor 
presents strong positive load. Plotting of PCA data due to the 
locations and seasons verify the differences in location 1 in 
relation to sampling locations and the dry and rainy seasons. 

Studies on acute water toxicity assays are known for the 
species Philodina acuticornis odiosa (Hagen et  al., 2009), 
Brachionus havanaensis (Juárez-Franco et  al., 2007), 
Brachionus macracanthus (Nandini et al., 2007), Brachionus 

patulus (Sarma et al., 2006) Brachionus calyciflorus (Calleja 
et  al., 1994), Brachionus plicatilis (Snell et  al., 1991), 
Brachionus rubens (Halbach et  al., 1983); however, there 
are no records of tests with rotifers in Brazil.

The species L. bulla fits the criteria of availability for 
laboratory culture, small-sized species and life cycle, organ-
ism availability, representation in the studied ecosystem and 
genetic stability for obtaining uniform organism stocks, 
being used as a test organism assessed in the present study, 
which proved to be positive to ponder the toxic potential of 
the analyzed surface water samples. 

CONCLUSION

Different statistical techniques used in this study showed how 
useful they can be to monitor surface water, identifying the va-
riables that better explain seasonal and temporal variations and 
the relationship between them. Multivariate analyses were in 
evidence, which allowed identifying the behavior of each season 
sampling and the correlation analysis that identified the relation-
ship among them. The PCA revealed the factors or the sources 
accounting for the water quality variations, proving to be an 
efficient way to manage water resources. Due to environmen-
tal degradation in the Atibaia River, especially in the region of 
Paulínia, the PCA technique was used, and the inferences about 
water quality could be drawn without a reference area. The main 
reason for the Atibaia River degradation in step with the phy-
sical-chemical and the ecotoxicological parameter evaluated has 
been the input of industrial and agricultural effluents, as well 
as domestic sewage, resulting from great changes in the water 
characteristics. Specifically in location S.1, the refinery effluents 
analyzed in this study may contain chemical compounds that 
could compromise, in this collection, the quality of the waters 
where they are discharged. L. bulla is a widely distributed species 
in the Brazilian aquatic ecosystems. It plays an important role in 
preserving primary production in biomass for a large number of 
invertebrates, and may be a useful and economic tool for moni-
toring surface water, since it is easy to culture and carry out toxi-
city assays. Moreover, it is sensitive to differences in water quality.
