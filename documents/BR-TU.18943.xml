resumo 
 

 

A hidrodinâmica da Ria de Aveiro tem sido extensamente analisada através de 
vários estudos observacionais e de modelação numérica, sendo concluído que 
a maré constitui o principal forçamento hidrodinâmico da laguna. Contudo, a 
costa adjacente à Ria de Aveiro está a sujeita a um clima de agitação marítima 
bastante intenso, com um regime de agitação anual médio caracterizado por 
ondas com altura significativa entre 2 e 2.5 m e períodos entre 9 e 11 s, 
tipicamente provenientes de WNW-NNW. Assim, é expectável que a 
hidrodinâmica da embocadura dependa simultaneamente da maré e da acção 
das ondas.  
Apesar dos vários estudos hidrodinâmicos realizados anteriormente sobre este 
sistema, o impacto das ondas na hidrodinâmica da embocadura nunca foi 
avaliado. Assim sendo, o principal objectivo deste estudo consiste em avaliar a 
influência do efeito da ondulação na dinâmica da embocadura, quer por 
análise de dados observados, quer por modelação numérica 
Na análise numérica foi utlizado o sistema de modelação MORSYS2D, que 
integra o modelo hidrodinâmico ELCIRC acoplado com o modelo de ondas 
SWAN. O modelo hidrodinâmico foi calibrado com sucesso, apresentando 
valores de RMS e Skill que reflectem o bom desempenho do modelo. 
A metodologia utilizada para atingir os objectivos definidos consiste em forçar 
os modelos numéricos com os constituintes harmónicos locais de maré e com 
diferentes cenários de ondas típicas do litoral norte Português: um cenário 
normal e outro de elevada actividade de ondas (regime de temporal). Foi 
igualmente definido um cenário de referência que consiste na ausência do 
forçamento das ondas. Os cenários foram simulados para três tipos distintos 
de maré: maré viva, intermédia e morta.  
Os resultados mostram que para o cenário normal de agitação marítima, a 
hidrodinâmica da embocadura é essencialmente dominada pela maré. Para o 
cenário de temporal, são encontradas sobre-elevações do nível do mar quando  
comparado com o cenário de normal actividade das ondas e com o cenário 
sem ondas. De facto, os resultados do modelo mostram que durante períodos 
de tempestade o nível do mar da laguna permanece acima do nível do mar 
observado ao largo.    
A análise do campo de correntes mostrou que as correntes induzidas pelas 
ondas interagem com as correntes de maré, alterando as suas características, 
quer em magnitude, quer em direcção do fluxo predominante. Assim, devido à 
sobre-elevação, a profundidade da coluna de água aumenta causando um 
ligeiro aumento da velocidade da corrente na zona da embocadura. 
Conclui-se que embora o forçamento principal da Ria de Aveiro seja a maré, o 
nível do mar e as flutuações de velocidade na embocadura da Ria de Aveiro 
também dependem do regime de agitação. Consequentemente, os eventos de 
tempestade podem alterar a sua hidrodinâmica, justificando que o 
acoplamento entre as ondas e marés deva ser considerado de modo a 
representar com precisão os processos que dependem da dinâmica de 
embocadura.

abstract 

 
The hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon has been extensively analysed 
through previous observational and numerical studies, being concluded that the 
tide is the main forcing of the lagoon’s hydrodynamic. However, the adjacent 
coastal zone of Ria de Aveiro is subjected to a highly energetic wave climate, 
with a yearly mean significant wave height of 2 - 2.5 m and wave periods of 9 - 
11 s, corresponding to WNW to NNW swell. Consequently, it should be 
expected that the lagoon inlet hydrodynamic depends simultaneously on both 
tidal and wave regime forcing. 
Despite the several hydrodynamic studies previously performed about this 
system, the impact of the coastal waves in the inlet hydrodynamic has never 
been evaluated. Thus, the main goal of this study is to assess the influence of 
the coastal wave regime at the inlet channel dynamics, either by observational 
data as by numerical modeling. 
The numerical analysis was performed through the modeling system 
MORSYS2D, which comprises the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC coupled with 
the wave model SWAN. The hydrodynamic model was successfully calibrated 
and the RMS errors and Skill values determined reflect the good performance 
of the model.  
The methodology used consists in forcing the numerical models with local tidal 
harmonic constituents and with different constant regular wave scenarios 
typical of the northern Portuguese coast: a normal and a high (storm condition) 
wave activity. A scenario with waves absence was also defined. These three 
scenarios were simulated for spring, intermediate and neap tidal conditions. 
The results found under the wage regime forcing show that for the low wave 
activity scenario (normal regime) the inlet hydrodynamics is mainly dominated 
by the tidal forcing. For the highest wave regime higher sea surface elevations 
at the inlet when compared with simulations performed only with tidal forcing or 
with the normal regime are found, induced by the wave set-up. In fact, the 
modelling results show that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea 
level during storm wave periods. 
The currents field analysis shows that the currents induced by the waves 
interact with the tidal currents, modifying its characteristics such as the 
magnitude and the direction of the predominant flow. In summary, due to wave 
set-up, the water depth increases, causing a slight increase of the current 
velocity in the inlet area. 
Is concluded that despite the tide constitute the dominant forcing of the Ria de 
Aveiro inlet hydrodynamics, the sea level and current velocity fluctuations at the 
Ria de Aveiro inlet also depend on the wave regime. Consequently, the storm 
events induce important waves set-up that change the inlet hydrodynamics, 
requiring that the coupling between waves and tides should be considered in 
order to accurately represent the processes dependent on the inlet dynamics.

Introduction  1 
 

1. Introduction 

 1.1. Motivation and Aims 

 Estuaries and the adjacent coastal areas are very complex and extremely dynamic regions 

exposed to vast natural and anthropic pressure. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon is an evident example of this, 

since it is inserted in highly populated region, harbouring important commercial and fishing ports. 

 The coastal shoreline includes a considerable extension of lagoons and estuaries, often 

characterized by dynamic tidal inlets. These environments are normally sheltered and the wave action is 

minimal when compared with exposed coasts [Short, 2007; Vila-Concejo et al., 2010]. 

 Coastal systems of this type are quite dynamic and strongly influenced by tidal action. The 

physics and hydrodynamics in these systems play a major role in the development of several processes, 

including ecological, biological and sediment transport. The importance of coastal systems has been 

recognized over the years, not only by the scientific community but also by the people who live around 

these areas. The freshwater discharge, the entry of sea water and transport of suspended sediment and of 

organic and inorganic nutrients are processes that have a great importance for urban and social-economic 

development of surrounding estuarine regions [Miranda et al., 2002]. 

 The scientific knowledge about these systems can be used to develop solutions to several 

problems such as the hydrographic basin’s changes, the identification of sedimentation areas that can 

affect navigation, the computation of the residence time of substances within these areas, the study of 

water properties patterns to support aquaculture projects, among others [Vaz, 2007]. In terms of estuarine 

hydrodynamics, tidal currents structure analysis is essential to understand problems such as dispersion, 

rate of pollutants, sediment transport and erosion processes [Prandle, 1982]. Moreover, tidal asymmetries 

and residual circulation have an influence on nutrient balances, sediment loads, particles and pollutants 

transportations [Aldridge, 1997]. Therefore, understanding the central processes induced by the tidal wave 

is crucial to obtain an overview concerning the different uses of the coastal systems. 

 Talking further about the tidal inlets, where this work is focused, is clear that its economic and 

environmental importance has been growing worldwide. The management of these systems is no longer 

restricted to the maintenance of navigation channels, but also addresses new challenges, such as the 

adjacent shoreline stability or the water renewal in the inner part of the system, for instance in the back 

barrier lagoons which are used for aquaculture. Portuguese lagoons illustrate very well this phenomenon, 

since many social and economic activities are concentrated in these coastal areas and include [Bertin et 

al., 2009]: 

? habitation and construction development on the barrier islands, despite the shoreline threat 

hazard; 

? aquaculture and fishing; 

? commercial maritime traffic; 

? recreational activities. 

 

According to Fitzgerald [1996], among the different types of tidal inlets, wave-dominated inlets 

rather occur in micro to mesotidal environments subjected to moderate to severe wave regimes. Because 

of the combination of wave, tides and shallow waters, wave dominated inlets are frequently extremely 

dynamic, with fast and considerable morphological changes. This strongly dynamic behaviour is 

particularly true for several Portuguese tidal inlets, where the combination of a severe wave climate, a 

mesotidal range and shallow channels may result in channel migration which can reach 200 meters within 

a few months [Oliveira et al., 2006a]. 



Introduction  2 
 

In this type of inlets, changes in the sea level may be related to the tide, but also with the action 

of wind and waves, and with meteorological events. Therefore, direct and indirect atmospheric and marine 

(tide and waves) forces cause large differences and rapid changes in the physical characteristics of 

coastal lagoons [Troussellier and Gattuso, 2007].  

The presence of waves can cause large differences in terms of sea-level variations [Nielsen and 

Apelt, 2003]; their relative importance depends upon the morphology of the lagoon entrance, as well as 

the local wave regime. In shallow and narrow entrances, the sea-level elevation caused by wave motion, 

such as wave breaking, is an important mechanism. This rise in sea level, or set-up, induced by waves is 

commonly termed as ‘‘wave set-up’’ [Angwenyi and Rydberg, 2005]. 

 Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the influence of the wave regime on the 

hydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro inlet through the analysis of field data and numerical model results. 

Combined with this primary aim, there are other specific goals such as: improve a previous implementation 

to Ria de Aveiro of the hydrodynamic numerical model ELCIRC, updating the lagoon bathymetry using the 

most recent bathymetry data sets and consequently recalibrating the model; use MORSYS2D to couple 

the wave model SWAN to ELCIRC, to make the study of the combined effects of tidal and wave regime. 

 Consequently, this work was driven not only by the need to improve and develop the numerical 

tools available to study Ria de Aveiro dynamics, but also to research the influence of the coastal waves in 

the lagoon hydrodynamic that has never been the subject of study in this coastal system. 

 

 1.2. State of the Art 

The importance of coastal environments is recognized worldwide by the scientific community, 

being published several studies on coastal lagoons focusing its hydrology, biology, physical and chemical 

processes, among others. 

The Ria de Aveiro lagoon was largely studied from a biological and chemical perspective and 

several publications regarding to bacterioplancton, zooplankton, benthic biodiversity, pollution impacts, 

fisheries, among several others issues were performed [e.g. Morgado et al., 2003; Lopes et al., 2010; 

Pereira et al., 2011; Ahmad et al., in press; Anjum et al., 2012; Pires et al., in press].  Also the physical 

processes in the lagoon have been studied in the last decades. One of the first steps in this task is the 

study made by Dias et al. [1999]. The authors concluded that the tide in the Ria de Aveiro is semi-diurnal 

and is the main forcing agent, and M2 and S2 are the most important constituents in the lagoon, 

representing approximately 90% of the tidal energy in Ria de Aveiro. They also showed that the lagoon 

should be considered vertically homogenous, with exception to periods of important rainfalls. These 

hydrological characteristics may also be found in Vaz and Dias [2008] which verified that, during the winter 

(wet season), the stratification caused by Vouga river flow can be extended up to the inlet. 

The tide in the entire lagoon was simulated by Dias et al. [2000] using a two-dimensional depth 

integrated mathematical model with the aim to predict the water level and depth mean current. These 

authors showed that tides propagate from the inlet and are present in the entire lagoon, decreasing its 

amplitude with the distance to the mouth while the phase lag increases. 

Another relevant study in order to understand the changes of tidal characteristics was performed 

by Araújo [2005]. The author compared two different surveys (1987/8 and 2002/3) in order to analyse sea 

level changes and the amplitude and phase of the main harmonic constituents. The data showed that the 

amplitude of the main harmonic constituents in the lagoon increased and its phase decreased. The tidal 

asymmetry also showed modifications over the past years. During 1987/8, the majority of the lagoon was 



Introduction  3 
 

flood-dominant and, since then, the central section of the Ria de Aveiro has become ebb-dominant 

whereas the northern and southern sections are flood-dominant. 

Several studies based on numerical modelling were performed to investigate subjects such as the 

tidal propagation in the lagoon [Dias and Fernandes, 2006; Dias and Picado, 2011], the Lagrangian 

transport of particles [Picado et al., 2011] and the sediment transport [Lopes et al., 2006; Lopes et al., 

2011b; Plecha et al., 2011; Plecha et al., 2012;]. 

An important numerical study were performed by Mendes et al. [2011], that included, for the first 

time in the numerical models, the low lying areas adjacent to Ria de Aveiro. The goal of this work is to 

evaluate if the inclusion of the low lying coastal adjacent flooded areas in the models’ numerical 

bathymetry induce changes in model predicted hydrodynamics for the Ria de Aveiro. They found minor 

differences for the Ria de Aveiro numerically predicted general circulation when including the low lying 

coastal adjacent flooded areas. 

Recently, Dias and Mariano [2011] evaluated the hydrodynamic response of Ria de Aveiro to an 

alteration on the present geometry of its inlet. It was studied the impact of the extension by 200 meters of 

the north jetty of the lagoon inlet. This study shows a slightly change of the local hydrodynamic patterns, 

and that may induce modifications in the overall lagoon circulation related with the tidal prism decrease 

found for the main channels. 

The Ria de Aveiro lagoon is also source of concern when discussing climate changes impacts. 

Silva and Duck [2001] analysed the historical modifications of bottom topography and tidal amplitude in 

the lagoon since the construction of the articial inlet and presented tendencies for future evolutions. These 

authors concluded that any future increase of the mean sea level will contribute to an increase of both 

area and volume of water mass, increasing the speed of tidal propagation. Lopes et al. [2011a] estimated 

the impact of sea level rise in lagoon hydrodynamics performing projections of SLR for the end of this 

century and found an increase of 20% of the lagoon tidal prism for a sea level rise of 0.42 m.  

The tidal prism, as well as the tidal asymmetry were also analysed by Picado et al. [2010] when 

explored possible tidal changes induced by local geomorphologic changes, specially the flood caused by 

salt pans walls collapse. These authors concluded that the increase of the lagoon total area (5.6% for 

extreme destruction) also results in an increase of 5% of the tidal prism as well as in the tidal asymmetry, 

with the higher variations found close to the flooded area and in neap tide. 

As previously mentioned, the influence of waves on the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics was never 

studied. However its influence in morphodynamics has already been studied. As example, Plecha et al. 

[2011], performed the evaluation of single waves effects on the morphologic evolution of a Ria de Aveiro 

lagoon inlet, concluding that the wave induced residual sediment fluxes in the cross sections upstream the 

lagoon mouth are smaller in magnitude than at the inlet, restricting the influence of the waves to the 

lagoon mouth and adjacent coastline. 

In fact, the influence of waves has been weakly studied, however, there are some works studying 

this subject in other Portuguese estuaries or rivers entrances. For instance, Malhadas et al. [2009] 

analysed the effect of the coastal waves on sea level in Óbidos lagoon and they found a correlation 

between wave height and sea-level elevation only during high wave activity periods, and the occurrence of 

a significant super-elevation on lagoon sea level during storm wave periods. This super-elevation is 

explained, not only by wave set-up or radiation stresses due to waves, but also by tidal inlet morphology. 

Additionally, this subject has relevance in some systems outside Portugal. Factors governing the 

relative magnitude of wave set-up at tidal inlets and river entrances have been addressed by Guza and 

Thorton [1981], Hanslow and Nielsen [1992], Hanslow et al. [1996], Dunn et al. [2000], Tanaka et al. 

[2000, 2003], Dunn [2001], Oshiyama et al. [2001] and Nguyen et al. [2007]. These authors found a wave 



Introduction  4 
 

set-up at tidal inlets or river entrances with its magnitude dependent on the coastal system characteristics, 

being the morphology of the inlet a determinant factor to be taken into account on the wave set-up 

generation. 

The most recent and consequently most importantly studies mentioned above, was the work 

performed by Nguyen et al. [2007], based upon data collected in seven different morphological river 

entrances and one inlet, showed that the set-up, or sea-level elevation, depends not only upon offshore 

wave height but also on the different morphological river entrances or tidal inlets. These authors found a 

correlation between wave set-up height and water depth of the entrance, concluding that the wave set-up 

height is inversely proportional to the average water depth, at a river entrance or inlet. 

Different numerical models have been used to study the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. The first 

numerical used to study the physical characteristics of Ria de Aveiro lagoon was SYMSYS2D model 

[Leendertse and Gritton, 1971]. Dias et al. [2000] used this numerical model to study the tidal propagation 

in Ria de Aveiro. Thenceforward, this model was used by several authors to study the Ria de Aveiro 

lagoon [Dias et al. 2003; Dias and Mariano, 2011]. More recently the lagoon has been characterized with 

other numerical models. As example, Vaz et al. [2005] and Vaz et al. [2007] used a 3D baroclinic model, 

Mohid [www.mohid.com], to study the importance of the river flow in the establishment of thermohaline 

horizontal patterns.  Other numerical model usually used to study the lagoon hydrodynamics is ELCIRC 

model. Oliveira et al. [2006b] resorted to this model to analyse the tidal propagation in Ria de Aveiro 

lagoon and the variability of tidal asymmetry in the upper and lower lagoon. Posteriorly, several authors 

applied this numerical model in Ria de Aveiro [Picado 2008; Lopes 2009; Picado et al. 2010]. 

In this study, it was used the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D. This modelling 

system integrates the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC [Zang et al., 2004], the wave model SWAN [Booij et 

al., 1999], and the model SAND2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004]. In this study, the module SAND2D was 

not activated. This modeling system has been already successfully applied in some previous studies in 

Ria de Aveiro. As example, Lopes et al. [2011a] used this numerical tool to study the local sea level 

change scenarios for the end of the 21st century and potential physical impacts in the lower Ria de Aveiro. 

[Plecha et al. 2011, 2012] also used this modeling system to study the Ria de Aveiro morphodynamics.

 2.1. General Description 

The Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is the most extensive in Portugal [Teixeira, 1994] shallow coastal 

lagoon located on the northwest coast of Portugal, being separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a sand 

dune barrier. It has an irregular geometry, and its only connection with Atlantic Ocean is through an 

artificial channel, constructed in 1808 [Dias, 2001, Dias and Mariano, 2011]. The lagoon has a maximum 

width of 8.5 km and a length of 45 km, being constituted by four main channels: Mira, São Jacinto, Ílhavo 

and Espinheiro channels. The Mira channel is an elongated shallow arm, with 14 km length. S. Jacinto 

channel is about 29 km long, and Ílhavo and Espinheiro are 15 and 17 km, respectively [Dias, 2001]. 

The system is also characterized by a large number of channels between which lie significant 

intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans [Picado et al., 2010].

 The Ria de Aveiro is a very important ecosystem to the local economy and to the environment. It 

acts as keystone to the local agriculture, holds a large number of small traditional fishing ports, houses the 

Aveiro’s Harbour, has aquaculture activities, it is an important place for the tourism with a growing 

subsector in the water sports area and it’s also related to the traditional salt production activities [Alves et 

al., 2011]. 

 From the nature conservation and biodiversity point of view, it is a great value area, both locally 

and nationally. It has a rich fauna and flora housing a large number of species. Due to rich variety of 

species the Aveiro lagoon was classified as a Special Protected Area, a classification that comes from the 

application of the Birds Directive. It contains also an important protected area, the Natural Reserve of 

‘Dunas de São Jacinto’. A well preserved dune barrier located in the seaside area of the lagoon with 

several ponds that present themselves as an essential habitat for numerous local and migratory birds. 

[Alves et al., 2011]. 

 

 2.2. Physical and Hydrodynamic Description 

 As mentioned before, the Ria de Aveiro is the most extensive lagoon in Portugal and it has a very 

complex and irregular geometry, composed by long and narrow channels, with a large longitudinal 

development, characterized by extensive intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marsh and old 

saltpans. Consequently, the physical processes that occur in the system are also quite complex. 

 The area of the lagoon has a large variability according with the tidal influence in its 

hydrodynamics. In spring tides the lagoon area reaches a maximum area of 83 km2 at high tide, which 

decreases to a minimum of 66 km2 at low tide. The average depth in Ria de Aveiro is about 1 meter, 

relative to local datum, although the inlet channel can exceed 30 meters deep, due to dredging operations 

that are frequently carried out to allow the navigation [Dias and Lopes, 2006a]. 

  The main forcing agent driving water circulation in Ria de Aveiro is the tide, which is mesotidal, 

presenting an average tidal amplitude at the inlet of 2 meters, and amplitudes of 0.6 meters in neap tides 

and 3.2 meters in spring tides [Dias 2001; Araújo et al., 2008]. Several authors evaluated the tidal prism 

for the Ria de Aveiro lagoon through different numerical models (considering different bathymetries), and 

several values were obtained. For maximum spring tide Dias [2001] and Lopes et al. [2006] estimate 

136.7×106 m3, Picado et al. [2010] 86.3×106 m3 and Lopes et al. [2010] 87.5×106 m3 and for minimum 

neap tide Dias [2001] and Lopes et al. [2006] estimated 34.9×106 m3, Picado et al. [2010] 31.0×106 m3 and 

Lopes et al. [2010] 28.9×106 m3. These values of tidal prism were computed in a flooding cycle, thus the 

flux related to these ranges are 3.87 to 6.12×103 m3s-1 for spring tide and 1.30 to 1.56×103 m3s-1 for neap 

tide. These values are much higher when compared with the total freshwater input in a tidal cycle. Moreira 

et al. [1993] projected an input of nearly 1.8×106 m3. The tidal prism of each channel relative to it its value 

at the mouth is: 35.4% for S. Jacinto channel, 25.6% for Espinheiro channel, 10.0% for Mira channel and 

13.5% for Ílhavo channel [Dias and Picado, 2011]. Likewise, the semidiurnal tides are the main factor 

influencing the hydrodynamics of the lagoon [Dias et al., 2000]. Thus, the most important harmonic 

constituents in Ria de Aveiro are M2 and S2, corresponding of about 88% and 10% of total tidal energy, 

respectively [Dias, 2001]. 

 The lagoon has five main rivers, one for each channel: Vouga, Antuã, Caster, Boco and Ribeira 

dos Moinhos, being the most important the Vouga river. According with Ria de Aveiro Polis Litoral 

program, which considered the data present in the Plano de Bacia Hidrográfica (www.arhcentro.pt), the 

mean freshwater inflow for Vouga River is 60.0 m3s-1, 4.5 m3s-1 for Antuã, 1.6 m3s-1 for Caster, and 1.0 and 

3.6 m3s-1 for Boco and Ribeira dos Moinhos, respectively.  



Study Area  7 
 

 Additionally to the tidal forcing, and in extreme situations, also the wind and freshwater discharge 

(mainly the Vouga river) influence the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. During strong freshwater flows, the 

lagoon is characterized as weakly stratified [Vaz and Dias, 2008]. Wind is very significant in Aveiro 

considering periods from a few hours to a few days, when can become an important influence on lagoon 

circulation. Extreme conditions of strong wind may induce particular circulation patterns mainly in shallow 

areas and wide channels [Dias, 2001]. 

 2.3. Wave and Wind Characterization 

 The wave and wind characterization was based in two technical reports of Plano de 
Ordenamento da Orla Costeira [Dias et al., 2011a; Dias et al., 2011b].  In summary, the analysis 

presented in this subsection is used to establish regimes of typical wind and wave climate, as well as the 

exceptional regimes (storms). Thus, this knowledge will allow the establishment of scenarios to perform 

the numerical simulations in the frame of the research topics to be developed in this study. 

 2.3.1. Wave Characterization 

The characterization of the wave regime was performed by analysing records of the Figueira da 

Foz wave directional buoy (40°11.13’ N; 9°8.73’ W, depth 92m ZH). The data was collected by the 

Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (IH) and is available on the website. The station is located 50 km South 

of Aveiro, however it is possible to say that there are no important variations in the wave regime in this 

spatial difference [Coli, 2003]. Therefore, in this work, it will considered that the wave regime in Figueira 

da Foz is representative of the region of Aveiro. The buoy data are comprised between 1984 and 1996. 

In more detail, through the buoy data analysis of the rose of directions shows that the waves have 

a predominance from the Northwest quadrant (Figure 2). The higher frequency of occurrence, 

corresponding to the sector NW, is equivalent to 41% of the percentage of records, and then the sectors 

WNW and NNW have a frequency of occurrence of 29% and 18%, respectively. The combination of 

frequency of occurrence of direction and Hs, also presented in Figure 2, illustrates that the highest waves 

occur at west-northwest direction, albeit with small percentage of occurrence. 

The distribution in classes of the significant wave height (Figure 3) shows that the class of 

significant height between 0.5 - 1.0 meters is dominant in the Portuguese coast with 40% frequency of 

occurrence, followed by class 1.5 - 2.5 meters with 35%. In continuity with the downward trend are the 

following classes, 2.5 - 3.5 and 3.5 - 4.5 meters, with frequencies of occurrence of 16% and 6%, 

respectively. With frequencies lower than 1% are found classes of significant height smaller than 0.5 m 

and higher than 5.5 meters. The waves with Hs higher than 5.5 meters represent the storm events. 

 The analysis of the distribution of the wave period (Figure 4) reveals that the most frequent 

periods of the waves in the Portuguese coast lie between 5 and 9 seconds, occurring with 77% of 

frequency. Within this range, the dominant class, with 23% of the frequency of occurrence, is 6 - 7 

seconds, followed by the class between 7 - 8 seconds with 20% of occurrences.

 Several storm events that were characterized by Hs higher than 5 meters and wave period higher 

than 10 seconds affects the study area during winter and transition periods. According to Pires [1985], 

there are two types of storm events. The first corresponds to exceptionally strong NW or SW swells that 

affected the area for one to two days. Several of these storm events are experienced each year, and are 

the most common types of storm that occur during the winter and transition periods of the western Iberian 

coast. The most severe of these storms can generate wave conditions with significant wave heights of up 

to 7.5 meters and wave peak periods of about 16.5 seconds. The second type of storm event is 

characterized by a succession of highly energetic storms that affect the western Iberian area for one to 

two weeks. These occur when the Azores anticyclone is situated at its most extreme southerly position 

(~30°N), allowing the transit of eastward-moving synoptic perturbations to the northern Iberian latitudes. 

These conditions, known as ‘westerly storms’, typically occur once per year and generate the most 

extreme wave conditions observed on the northern Portuguese shelf, mainly associated with a southerly 

wind regime [Pires, 1985]. 

In contrast to winter conditions, in the summer the wave regime is characterized by low energy 

conditions. From June to September, significant wave heights mean periods and peak periods are 

consistently smaller than 3 meters, 8 and 12 seconds, respectively. The monthly averages and standard 

deviations of the wave parameters are at their lowest values between June and August. In August, 

significant wave heights are smaller than 3 meters [Vitorino et al., 2002]. 

 

 2.3.2. Wind Characterization 

The characterization of the wind field was performed through the analysis and representation of 

monitored data from the meteorological station ‘Casal do Rato’ (http://snirh.pt). The station is located in 

Figueira da Foz (40°09'12.52'' N, 8°50'36.07'' W), 50 km South of Aveiro. However in this study, the wind 

of the station ‘Casal do Rato’ is considered representative of the wind in the region of Aveiro. Wind 

intensity and the percentage of occurrence of each direction for all the records and seasonally (Spring, 

Summer, Autumn and Winter) are represented. The date of station data are between the years 2001 and 

2009. 

The most representative values of wind speed are between 0 and 8 ms-1, while maximum values 

are around 18 ms-1. Relatively to the prevailing wind direction, it should be noted that in the wind rose is 

shown the place where the wind blows. Thus, a typical North wind is represented in the wind roses in the 

lower quadrants. Therefore, the analysis of Figure 5 shows that the prevailing winds are from Northwest 

(NW) and Southeast (SE). In more detail, about 37% of the wind records are from NW quadrant, 27% 

comes from SE quadrant, 22% from NE quadrant, and finally, 15% from SW.

 In Figure 6 is illustrated the seasonal variability of intensity and wind direction for Casal do Rato 

meteorological station. Note that the months of March, April and May are considered as Spring, June, July 

and August as Summer, September, October and November as Autumn, and finally, December, January 

and February as Winter. 

 In Spring about 60% of the wind records are northerly, with considerable speed, especially the 

winds coming from NW. These are most frequent (approximately 40%) and also the strongest, being 

usually referred as 'Nortada'. This phenomenon is even more evident in the Summer months, with about 

70% of wind records coming from the North, with maximum speeds of 18 ms-1. During these months, the 

wind that comes from South is typically weaker, with maximum values of 8 ms-1. 

 The patterns observed for Autumn and Winter are quite similar, showing higher frequency of wind 

records from the NW and SE quadrant. For the Autumn months, 35% of the winds are from the SE and 

30% from NW. Already in the Winter months, 35% of the wind comes from the SE quadrant and 25% 

comes from NW. North winds are of higher intensity (almost always greater than 4 ms-1), whereas the 

South winds have frequently intensity of 2 to 4 ms-1.

Numerical Models and Methodology  11 
 

3. Numerical Models and Methodology 

The numerical simulations were performed with the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system 

MORSYS2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004]. This modelling system integrates the hydrodynamic model 

ELCIRC [Zang et al., 2004], which calculates tidal elevations and currents, the wave model SWAN [Booij 

et al., 1999], which computes wave propagation and the model SAND2D [Fortunato and Oliveira, 2004] 

that computes sand transports and updates the bottom topography. In this study, the module SAND2D 

was not activated. A brief description of each model component used in this study is presented in the 

following subsections. 

  

 3.1. Hydrodynamic Numerical Model (ELCIRC) 

ELCIRC (www.stccmop.org/CORIE/modeling/elcirc/index.html) is a model developed for the 

effective simulation of three dimensional baroclinic circulation across river-to-ocean scales. The model 

ELCIRC uses a finite-volume/finite difference Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm to solve the set of six 

hydrostatic equations based on the Boussinesq approximation: mass conservation, momentum 

conservation and conservation of salt and heat, addressing a wide range of physical processes and of 

atmospheric, ocean and river forcings [Zhang et al. 2004]. A finite volume technique conservation and 

natural treatment of wetting and drying are used to solve the model equations. The horizontal domain is 

discretized with a triangular mesh for flexibility. A semi-implicit time-stepping algorithm and the 

Lagrangean treatment of advective terms ensure stability at large time steps [Oliveira et al., 2006b]. 

Within MORSYS2D, the hydrodynamic model solves the equations in order to determine the free 

surface elevation, 3D water velocity, salinity and temperature. In Ria de Aveiro, a single layer is adopted, 

so the model reverts from 3 dimensions into 2 dimensions. The depth-integrated equations solved in this 

model express the conservation of mass and momentum:

 There are several options of forcing agents in ELCIRC within MORSYS2D: tides, tidal potential,

waves-induced radiation stresses are considered in this study. Under the action of tides only, the stress is 

defined at the bottom according to each horizontal direction:

A semi-implicit scheme is used in the numerical algorithm of ELCIRC. The barotropic pressure 

gradient in the momentum equation and the flux term in the continuity are treated semi-implicitly, with 

implicitness factor 0.5 ? ?  ? 1. The vertical viscosity term and the bottom boundary condition for the 

momentum equation are treated fully implicit and all other terms are treated explicitly. According to Casulli 

and Cattani [1994] this ensures both stability and computational efficiency. 

According to Longuet-Higgins and Stewart [1964] and Phillips [1977] the effect of short waves on 

the hydrodynamics is expressed through the forcing by the gradients of wave radiation stresses, which in 

this 2DH mode can be defined by:

 3.2. Wave Model (SWAN) 

SWAN is a third generation wave prediction model used to represent wave conditions in coastal 

and near-shore waters. This model has been extensively used for environmental impact assessment 

studies, sediment transport studies, near-shore wave prediction. The free surface elevation in SWAN is 

described in terms of action density (or energy density in the absence of currents). The energy balance 

equation gives a statistical description of the time evolution of surface gravity waves [Booij et al., 1999]. 

The wave model SWAN [Booij et al., 1999] computes the evolution of the wave spectrum by 

solving the spectral action balance equation adapted to near shore zones, given in Cartesian coordinates 

by Equation 13.

in which ?  is the wave frequency (s-1), ?  the wave angle (radians), N the wave action density (m), xc , 

y
c  the wave propagation speeds in x and y directions (ms-1) and S the energy source term (ms-2). 

The first term is the local rate of change of action density with respect to time. The second and 

third terms represent the propagation of the group velocity over a cartesian grid ( xc  and yc  are the 

group velocity in x and y space). The fourth term accounts for the shifting of the relative frequency of 

waves due to variations in depth and currents. The fifth term is the refraction and propagation due to the 

depths and currents in the directional space ( ?c and ?c  are in spectral space). The right side of the 

equation incorporates S, which is the total of all source and sink terms in the form of energy density. 

The model SWAN also accounts for depth-induced wave breaking and triad wave-wave 

interactions which is important for near-shore wave predictions. The inherent physical processes 

accounted in SWAN comprises the parameterization of wind input, non-linear wave-wave interaction, 

white-capping dissipation, bottom interaction, changes due to variation in water depth and effect of 

currents [Arora et al., 2012]. In this study, the white-capping dissipation was not taken into account. 

 

 3.2.1 Wave Model Setup 

In the present study two nested grids are used in the wave model with different dimensions and 

characteristics, as reported in Plecha [2011] and Plecha et al., [2012]. The grid with higher dimensions 

extends from the offshore area with a coarser resolution. In this grid are imposed the waves boundary 

conditions: a regular monochromatic wave or a wave regime. The second grid encompassing the inlet 

area is curvilinear in space and with finer resolution. The calibration of SWAN was performed by Plecha 

[2011], by comparing model predictions with buoy records at Leixões (41°19'00"N, 8°59'00"W).

 3.3. Model Establishment and Hydrodynamic Model Calibration 

 This study starts with the improvement of the previous implementation of the hydrodynamic 
model ELCIRC performed by Picado [2008], in order to understand the consequences of the partial salt 

pans walls destruction on the entire Ria de Aveiro lagoon hydrodynamics. The author used a bathymetry 

with topo-hydrographic data mainly from 1987/88 collected by Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (I.H). 

The exception is the inlet area where the bathymetry were updated with 2001 data, collected by the 

Administration of the Ria de Aveiro (A.P.A.). 

 Is known that the depth and the morphology of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro changed 

considerably since 1987/88 until nowadays. For that reason and in order to represent the physical 

processes in the lagoon with more recent data, the bathymetry developed by Picado [2008] was updated, 

constituting the first step of this study. 

 Thus, the new bathymetry is composed by a 

compilation of 3 different topo-hydrographic data (POLIS 

2011 collected by Ria de Aveiro Polis Litoral program; A.P.A 

2010 data, collected by Administration of the Ria de Aveiro 

in the year 2010 and finally, the data of I.H 1987/88 also 

present in the bathymetry used by Picado [2008]). Thus, as 

illustrated in Figure 7, the bathymetry in the inlet area was 

updated with the data collected by A.P.A in 2010. The 

majority of the S.Jacinto channel was updated with POLIS 

2011 data, however, in some channels in the upstream zone 

of the S.Jacinto channel, the bathymetry is from 1987/88. 

 In the downstream zone of Mira channel, the 

bathymetry was updated with A.P.A 2010 data, while in the 

remaining channel, the data used to update the bathymetry 

was POLIS 2011 data. 

  With the exception of the downstream area that 

was updated with A.P.A data, the Ílhavo channel was mainly 

updated with POLIS 2011 data. 

 Since the downstream area until the middle zone of 

the Espinheiro channel, the bathymetry was updated with 

POLIS recent data. The upstream zone of the channel keeps 

with the data of 1987/88. 

 The analysis of Figure 7 allows affirm that the 

principal zones of the main channels were updated with 

more recent data. 

  The two bathymetries (the bathymetry used by 

Picado [2008] and bathymetry created in this study) are 

represented in Figure 8, and the zoom of the inlet zone 

(study area) is also in the figure. The numerical bathymetries 

are referent to average mean sea level (2 m). The main difference between them is the deepening visible 

in the new bathymetry when compared with the bathymetry used by Picado [2008]. This is mainly

observed in the inlet zone, in the deeper zones of S.Jacinto channel and in the downstream region of

 The grid initially used in this study is the grid developed by Picado [2008] and represented in 

Figure 9 (B). It is numerical discretized with 87747 elements and 66092 nodes. This grid includes, with 

high resolution, all the channels in the interior of the lagoon, however without high resolution in offshore 

and inlet regions. Therefore, after some numerical runs, it was concluded that this grid has insufficient 

resolution in offshore zone to represent accurately the coastal waves propagation.  

 Therefore, it was necessary integrate the grid with higher resolution in the offshore and inlet 

areas developed by Plecha [2011] in order to study the morphodynamic in the Ria de Aveiro inlet. It is 

numerical discretized with 43169 elements and 25819 nodes. Due to the focus of the study (inlet area) 

performed by Plecha [2011], in this grid is excluded some interior channels of Ria de Aveiro. Thus, the 

final grid (C) is a merging of a grid with high resolution in the ocean area (A) with a grid with a high 

resolution in the lagoon area (B), as represented in Figure 9. Thus, this grid allows studying accurately the 

processes that occur in the inlet without neglecting the interiors channels of Ria de Aveiro. The final grid 

has 103515 elements and 74094 nodes, and is illustrated in the bottom panel of the figure (C).

 Once completed this procedure, was performed the hydrodynamic model calibration. The 

hydrodynamic model ELCIRC was forced by eleven harmonic constituents (MSF, O1, K1, N2, M2, S2, M4, 

MN4, MS4, M6 and 2MS6) obtained from the regional model of Fortunato et al. [2002]. The largest time step 

that prevents the appearance of oscillations was set to 90 seconds.  

 The calibration of the hydrodynamic model is based on the adjustments of parameters to which 

the model is most sensitive. According to Dias and Fernandes [2006], the magnitude of the bottom friction 

coefficient induces changes in the tidal wave propagation within the Ria de Aveiro. The water depth 

influences strongly the bottom stress. Therefore, based in previous works [Dias and Lopes, 2006a,b; Dias 

et al. 2009; Picado et al., 2011], it was decided to use the Manning coefficient dependent of the depth as 

calibration parameter. Several model runs were performed to calibrate the numerical model, by adjusting 

the bottom stress in order to reduce the differences between the available data and model results, 

reaching the relationship showed in Table 1. The Manning coefficients were adjusted using the guideline 

that an increase in the bottom friction will induce a decrease in the tidal wave amplitude in that zone, and 

vice-versa. Another principle used is that an increase in the bottom friction will lead an increase in the 

phase lag for high tide and a decrease for low tide [Fry and Aubrey, 1990].

 The model was calibrated following the methodology proposed by Dias and Lopes (2006a), by 

initially comparing visually the observed sea surface elevation data with the hydrodynamic model results. 

For the model calibration, the data available are from field works carried out in Ria de Aveiro in the years 

2003 and 2004. Field data were collected in the framework of the Araújo [2005] PhD Thesis and the 

measurements were performed every six minutes, with the exception of the Barra station, where the 

measurements were performed every hour. It is important to note that, in order to compare model results 

with measurements, the low frequency signal was removed from the data, considering a cut-off frequency 

of 0.0000093 Hz (30 h). This method has already been adopted in previous studies [Picado, 2008]. 

 The hydrodynamic model calibration is performed at 18 stations within the lagoon (Figure 10). 

The predicted and observed time series of sea surface elevation comparison is shown in Figures 11 and 

12. After comparing visually the observed sea surface elevation data with the hydrodynamic model results, 

the model performance was quantified by Root Mean Square (RMS) errors and Skill parameter (Table 2), 

given by:

[2009], the RMS values should be compared with the local tidal amplitude and if those errors are lower 

than 5% of the local amplitude, the agreement between model results and observations should be 

considered excellent and if they range between 5% and 10% the agreement should be considered very 

good. The model predictive Skill, a method developed by Wilmott [1981] and used initially by Warner et al. 

[2005] and Li et al. [2005], yield a Skill of one for a perfect agreement between model results and 

observations and zero for a complete disagreement. Skill values higher than 0.95 should be considered 

representative of an excellent agreement between model results and observations [Dias et al., 2009]. 

It was also performed the comparison between 

the observed and predicted amplitude and phase of the 

main tidal constituents determined from harmonic 

analysis is also performed, in order to quantify 

separately the amplitude and phase lags of the major 

tidal constituents for the all monitoring stations (Figure 

13). In this work the harmonic analysis is performed 

using Pawlowicz et al. [2002] package.

3.3.1. Results 

 With the exception of the stations E, M, K and J, the RMS values ranges from 2.5% to 13.3% of 

the local amplitude in all stations. The stations B, F, G, H, I, L, N, O, P, Q and R have a RMS value 

between 0 and 10%. Thus, the agreement between predictions and observations, in the most of the 

stations, ranges from very well to excellent. For the stations E, M, K and J located on the North of the 

lagoon, the agreement between model and observations are lower comparing with other previous studies 

[Picado, 2008]. In the analysis of the calibration results, it is important to note that, in this study, is 

compared field data from 2003 with modelling results of the year 2011. Is known, through several 

publications, including Araújo et al., [2008], which over the years, the tidal range in the Ria de Aveiro has 

been increased, and the phase is decreasing. Thus, it is likely that these patterns will be visible in the time 

series of SSE, and in the comparison of the amplitude and phase of the main harmonics constituents. In 

these stations (E, M, K and J), the patterns identified by Araújo et al., [2008] are amplified, leading a 

highest disagreement between predictions and observations.

At station B (Barra), the most important for the aim of this study because is where this work is 

focused, the computed and observed data comparison should be perfect. The RMS is approximately 7 cm, 

which represents an error of 2.5% when compared with local tidal amplitude. This small error may partially 

explain the errors found in the other stations within the lagoon. In stations B, F, G, L and O the 

disagreement is lower than 5% of local tidal range. In general, the errors increase with the distance 

between the station and the lagoon mouth. 

The time series represented in Figures 11 and 12 shows that the model results predicts a global 

increase of tidal amplitude since 2003 to 2011 and a slight phase lag between predictions and 

observations leading to an increase of the RMS. However, these patterns are in agreement with Araújo et 

al. [2008]. 

With the exception of the stations D, E, J, K and M, the skill values are always higher than 0.90. 

All of these stations are in the upstream zone of the channels, where the model has lower agreement with 

the observations. The stations B, F, G, H, I, L, N, O, P and Q have skill values greater than 0.95, thus it 

should be considered as an excellent agreement between model results and observations.

 The analysis of the tidal constituents reveals that the M2 and S2 are the most important 

constituents in the lagoon, representing approximately 90% of the tidal energy in Ria de Aveiro lagoon in 

agreement with Dias et al. [1999]. The tidal constituent comparison shows major disagreement at the 

upstream stations.  

 The analysis of these results shows that the mean amplitude difference, in all stations, for the M2 

constituent is about 9 cm, and the mean phase difference is about 10º. This value corresponds to a 

difference of about 20 minutes in the arrival of tidal wave. In the station B, this difference is much smaller 

than the average value (less than 6 minutes in phase and 0.15 cm in amplitude). For the S2 constituent, 

the mean amplitude difference is approximately 4 cm and phase difference is 10º, which means that the 

average delay is about 29 minutes. At station B, the difference in amplitude is 8 cm and in the phase is 

1.8º, corresponding to 3.7 minutes. 

 For diurnal constituents (O1 and K1), the results are similar when compared with the semi-diurnal 

constituents, but with higher disagreement. The apparent error present in the O1 phase at stations C, H 

and P is because of the adopted graphic scale. For the O1 constituent, the mean amplitude difference 

corresponds to 0.79 cm and the mean phase difference is 48º, which means that the average delay is 

about 207 minutes. However, in Barra station it is observed a better agreement between model and 

observations, with an average of amplitude difference of about 0.26 cm and phase delay about 14 

minutes. The mean amplitude difference for K1 constituent is about 1.3 cm and the mean phase difference 

is approximately 60º, corresponding to 239 minutes. For station B (Barra), the amplitude difference is 0.25 

cm and the phase difference is 6º, corresponding to a delay of 25 minutes. 

 The M4 is a harmonic constituent which characterises a short-period harmonic term in order to 

take into account the change in the form of a tidal wave resulting from shallow water condition. In shallow 

waters the progression of a tidal wave is changed by numerous physical factors which depend on the 

square or higher powers of the tidal amplitudes [Pugh, 1996]. The mean amplitude difference, in all 

stations, for the M4 constituent is about 6 cm while the mean phase difference is 69º, which corresponds to 

71 minutes. In the most important station for this study, the difference in amplitude is 0.47 cm and the 

phase delay is about 30 minutes. The M4 constituent amplitude and phase was not reproduced with the 

expected accuracy. The errors found in this constituent reproduction may be due to bathymetric errors that 

cannot be corrected by the adjustment of the bottom coefficient and because it was not considered the low 

lying areas adjacent to Ria de Aveiro. 

 According to the RMS and Skill results obtained, it may be considered that the model reproduces 

accurately the SSE data, and consequently the tidal processes in the lagoon. The numerical results 

obtained for the study area (inlet) should be considered in excellent agreement with the observed data. 

Relatively to the harmonic analysis, the observations and predictions has a good agreement, essentially in 

semi-diurnal constituents (the most important). In Barra station, area where this study is focused, the 

results are very good. Therefore it may be concluded that the hydrodynamic model is calibrated and able 

to reproduce the tidal processes in the area of interest for this study.

 3.4. Analyses of Field Data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric Pressure  

 In this subchapter, will be present the methodology used to relate the field data of Hs with over-

elevations in Sea Surface Elevation (SSE), from the Barra tidal gauge (40°38.5’N, 8°44.92’W). The data 

available of Hs is from the Leixões Buoy comprised between 1984 and 1996. In this case, the analysis is 

done considering the Leixões wave directional buoy data, when previously was made with Figueira da Foz 

buoy data. This is possible because, according with Coli [2003], there is homogeneity of wave climate on 

the northern coast of Portugal. 

 Therefore, between 1984 and 1996, were searched events of high wave climate. Of the several 

found, will be studied the month of December of 1985 as well as the period between 1 and 15 of January 

of 1996. 

 In order to separate the high (tidal signal) and low frequencies signals of the tidal gauge data, 

was used a filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.0000093 Hz (30 h). Therefore, in the low frequency signal 

are included the meteorological events, mainly the atmospheric pressure variation, as well as the coastal 

waves effects. Thus, taking into account the goal of this work (study the influence of coastal waves in the 

inlet hydrodynamics), in order to represent only the effect of the waves in the low frequency signal, was 

remored the influence of atmospheric pressure in the SSE through the inverted barometer effect, given by: 

a

where ?? is the water level variation, ?  is the water density, g  is the acceleration of gravity and ap? is 

the atmospheric pressure variation, given by Pmeasured – 1013.25 hPa. The value of 1013.25 hPa 

corresponds to the normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level. 

 The atmospheric pressure data used in this work for the Aveiro coast are available in the website 

of NOAA [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html], corresponding to 

reanalysis data with a temporal resolution of 6 hours. In order to put in concordance the atmospheric 

pressure and tidal gauge data, an interpolation of the atmospheric pressure data was made, creating a 

new serie with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. 

 With this procedure is quantified the effect of the coastal waves in the SSE, through the analysis 

of field data, since a direct comparison between Hs data and the low frequency signal containing only the 

effect of the waves will be performed. 

 3.5. Establishment of Scenarios  

 After it has been demonstrated that the model simulates accurately the Ria de Aveiro 

hydrodynamics, will be defined the scenarios to simulate, in order to understand the influence of the 

waves in the lagoon hydrodynamics. 

 The SWAN model runs considering the wave and wind fields as driving forces, more specifically 

the significant wave height, period and direction of the waves and the velocity and direction of the wind. 

These inputs are defined and considered as constant for all the simulation period. As schematized in 

Figure 14, for each tidal range (Spring, Typical and Neap tide), it was simulated the normal and the storm 

wave action in the Portuguese coast, and a case with the absence of waves. The case with the absence of 

waves, therefore considering only the tidal forcing, is defined as scenario 0, constituting the reference 

scenario. 

(14) 



Numerical Models and Methodology  25 
 

 The normal and storm scenarios were defined taking into account the characterization of waves 

and wind presented in section 2.3. Thus, the normal regime has a typical WNW to NNW swell, with Hs 

between 2 and 2.5 meters and periods between 9 and 11 seconds, and moderate wind Northerly. In the 

storm events, the Hs may reach 8 meters, and the waves usually come from SW with a period of 12 

seconds. In these events, the wind is stronger and has a provenience from SE.  

 Therefore, the normal regime named scenario 1 is characterized by: 

? Significant wave height (Hs) = 2 meters 

? Wave period  = 9 seconds 

? Wave direction  = NW 

? Wind speed = 4 ms-1 

? Wind direction  = NW 

 

For storm regime named scenario 2 it was considered: 

 

? Significant wave height (Hs) = 8 meters 

? Wave period  = 12 seconds  

? Wave direction  = SW 

? Wind speed = 16 ms-1 

? Wind direction  = SE 

 

 The duration of the simulations is 8 days, and the spring, typical and neap tide were identified 

through the analyses of the tide at the inlet of the Ria de Aveiro during the year 2011. The event of 

maximum tidal amplitude (spring tide) was in March 20th 2011, the minimum amplitude (neap tides) in July 

24th 2011 and intermediate tidal range in November 12th 2011.

 4.1. Analyses of Field Data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric pressure 

 As mentioned in the methodology of the analyses of field data of SSE, Hs and Atmospheric 

pressure (section 3.4), the aim of this subsection is relate the Hs with over-elevations measured of the 

Barra tidal gauge and induced by coastal waves. Then, the SSE variations induced by atmospheric 

pressure were removed from the low frequency signal of SSE, in order to represent only the influence of 

waves in this signal. 

 Therefore, the atmospheric pressure data from December of 1985 (upper panel) and between 1 

and 15 of January of 1996 (lower panel) is represented in Figure 15.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  28 
 

 The atmospheric pressure has an important effect in SSE, wherein an increase of atmospheric 

pressure causes a compression in the water column leading to under-elevation in SSE. On the other hand, 

a decrease of atmospheric pressure causes an expansion of water column leading to over-elevation of 

SSE. Thus, a 1 mbar atmospheric pressure change corresponds to a linear response of the sea level of 

about 1 cm.  

 Therefore, in the upper panel of Figures 16 and 17 are illustrated the time series of the tidal signal 

(red line) and of the low frequency signal (blue line), which might be originated by meteorological action or 

'wave set-up', collected from the Barra tidal gauge, for the periods in study.  

 The values of atmospheric pressure represented in Figure 15 were converted to values of low 

frequency water level through the expression of inverted barometer effect, constituting the red line of the 

middle panel of Figures 16 and 17. The blue line corresponds to the low frequency signal, also 

represented in the upper panel.  

 The analysis of the middle panel shows that the atmospheric pressure is related with the low 

frequency signal, because some over or under-elevations are mainly caused by the atmospheric pressure 

variation. However, there are some periods in the times series that the low frequency signal is not related 

with the atmospheric pressure, therefore, in the lower panel is represented the low frequency signal 

without the atmospheric pressure contribution. Thus, only the influence of coastal waves is represented. 

 Analysing the figures is observed that the tidal forcing is the most important forcing in the Ria de 

Aveiro, and the waves have a visible effect on SSE. In fact, some over-elevations observed in the figures 

are caused by the coastal waves. Some of these events are represented with a black bar in the figures. 

When Hs increases up to 4 meters, the mean sea level caused by wave set-up increases to a maximum of 

approximately 0.21 m. When the Hs decrease, the signal also tends to decrease. Indeed, only the waves 

higher than 4 meters have a considerable effect in SSE. The waves with a Hs lower than this value, has a 

maximum of over-elevation of 7 cm. 

In most cases, the estimation of wave set-up at inlets is only based on observations. Numerical 

models, on the other hand, provide an approach to study the importance of simulating waves effect or 

other external forces (e.g., winds) upon the hydrodynamic behaviour. In addition, hydrodynamic model 

applications are useful in understanding the main physical processes [Malhadas et al., 2009]. 

 Thus, these initial results through field data analyses could provide a starting point to understand, 

through the use of numerical modelling, the real effect of waves on the hydrodynamics of the Ria de 

Aveiro inlet.

 4.2. Modelling Results 

 4.2.1. Sea Surface Elevation 

 Considering the scenarios defined in section 3.5, the results of the numerical simulations 

performed are present in this subsection. Additionally, the variations in sea surface elevation induced by 

the wave action are evaluated. First, the analysis of the time series of SSE at station 1 is performed, for 

each tidal range. The horizontal fields of the differences of SSE between scenarios 0 and 1 and between 

scenarios 1 and 2 for each tidal range are also shown in this subchapter. 

 4.2.1.1. Spring Tide 

 The time series for the three scenarios aforementioned for spring tide condition for station 1 

(Figure 8) are illustrated in Figure 18, as well as the differences between all the scenarios.

spring tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to illustrate 

horizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the differences between 

all the scenarios.  



Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  32 
 

 The analysis of the SSE time series reveals that the normal wave climate (scenario 1) has no 

influence in the sea surface elevation, because there is an almost complete overlap of the lines of the 

scenario 1 and scenario 0. For the storm regime scenario (scenario 2) is found a clear over-elevation of 

the sea surface (wave set-up), and consequently the high and low tides have higher elevations. The 

differences between the numerical results are higher in low tide when compared with high tide (visible in 

the low panel of the figure). In the station analysed, the difference between scenarios 1 and 2 in the high 

tide is 14.5 cm, while in the low tide is about 25 cm. As mentioned before, the differences between the 

scenarios 0 and 1 are not substantial, however there is a slight over-elevation in scenario 1 not visible in 

the figure. In high tide, those differences are 1.3 cm, while in low tide are 1.2 cm. The analysis of the low 

panel of time series help to clarify that the differences between scenarios 0 and 1 (red line) are negligible. 

The highest difference between these scenarios is 3.6 cm. The figure also shows that the differences 

between blue and green lines corresponding to the differences between scenario 2 and 0, and between 2 

and 1, respectively, never exceed 2.1 cm, therefore, for this station, only the storm waves (scenario 2) 

causes significant changes in SSE. In order to investigate if these differences are not significant for all the 

inlet area, the horizontal fields of the differences between SSE determined for scenarios 0 and 1 are 

performed and are presented in Figure 19. It is important to note that the vertical lines and correspondent 

letters, represented in Figure 18, correspond to instants chosen to illustrate the horizontal sea surface 

elevation fields. In order to analyse the time evolution of the spatial distribution of the SSE differences, the 

images A, B, C and D of Figure 19 corresponds to high tide, ebb condition, low tide and flood condition, 

respectively. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0.  

 The analysis of Figure 19 reveals that the differences between the scenarios 0 and 1 never 

exceed the 3 cm, being close to 0 for most of the area, therefore there are negligible. Thus, it is assumed 

that the SSE in scenarios 0 and 1 are equal. Taking this into account and to better visualize the effects of 

the wave characteristics, horizontal fields of the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 are performed and 

are presented in Figure 20. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to 

scenario 1. 

 The patterns found in the illustration of the SSE time series (Figure 18) are also perceptible in the 

horizontal fields of SSE differences between scenarios 1 and 2 (Figure 20), verifying an over-elevation in 

scenario 2. Generally, the Barra beach (south to the inlet) is the most affected area by the coastal waves. 

In contrast, the Meia Laranja beach is the local where the wave set-up is smaller, because it is a sheltered 

zone. 

  Analysing the time evolution it is observed that at high tide (Figure 20 A) the differences between 

the scenarios are minimal, approximately 15 cm in whole inlet area. However, between the jetties there 

are areas where the differences are 17 cm. On the other hand, in the Meia Laranja beach the wave set-up 

is minimal (12 cm). In ebb condition (Figure 20 B), the differences increase to values around 19 cm in 

most of the inlet area. Close to the North jetty, the difference between the scenarios are lower (12 cm), 

while near to the South jetty, the difference is about 22 cm. In the low tide (image C), the differences 

reache a maximum of 21 cm in all the inlet area. In the flood condition (image D), the difference between 

the scenarios decrease to values about 13 cm.

 4.2.1.2. Intermediate Tide 

 The time series for the three scenarios mentioned before for the intermediate tidal condition are 

illustrated in Figure 21 for station 1 (upper panel). In order to better visualize the differences between the 

scenarios, the time series of the differences between all of them are illustrated in the lower panel. 

 Similarly to the spring tide condition, the normal wave climate (scenario 1) has no influence in the 

sea surface elevation while the storm regime scenario (scenario 2) shows a clear over-elevation of the sea 

surface elevation (wave set-up). The SSE differences are, once again, higher in low tide. In the station 

analysed, the difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 in high tide is about 13 cm, while in low tide is 

approximately 19 cm. As in the previous tidal condition, the differences between the scenario 0 and 1 are 

negligible, however there is a slight over-elevation in scenario 1. In the high tide, those differences are 1.8 

cm, while in the low tide are 0.6 cm. These values are clearly visible in the low panel of the Figure 21.

for intermediate tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to 

illustrate horizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the differences 

between all the scenarios. 



Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  36 
 

 The lower panel of Figure 21 lightens that the major differences are verified in scenario 2, 

because, as in spring tide condition, the differences between scenario 1 and 0 (red line) are close to 0, 

reaching a maximum of 3.2 cm. The blue and green lines corresponding to the differences between 

scenario 2 and 0, and between 2 and 1, respectively, reinforce the idea that there are no major differences 

between scenarios 0 and 1 (major differences between theses lines are 2.9 cm). Thus, it is possible to say 

that, for station 1, only the storm waves have influence in Sea Surface Elevation. In order to demonstrate 

that the differences between 0 and 1 are negligible in the entire inlet area, the horizontal fields of the 

differences between SSE for scenarios 0 and 1 are performed and are presented in Figure 22. Positive 

values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0. As before, the vertical 

lines and correspondent letters, represented in Figure 21, correspond to instants chosen to illustrate 

horizontal sea surface elevation fields. Similarly to the Spring tide condition, the differences in SSE 

between scenarios 0 and 1 never exceeds 3 cm in the entire inlet region, showing that the differences 

between scenarios 0 and 1 are negligible. Having this knowledge as a starting point, the horizontal 

fields of the SSE differences between scenarios 1 and 2 were performed and are presented in Figure 23. 

Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to scenario 1. 

 As referred in the analyses of time series (Figure 21), the wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively 

to scenario 1 in the high tide (Figure 23 A) is about 13 cm. The difference between scenario 1 and 2 is 

constant in the entire inlet zone. In the ebb condition (image B), the patterns are similar to those obtained 

in the high tide, however the differences increase to values around 15 cm, reaching a maximum in the 

image C, corresponding to low tide condition. In this case, the differences between the scenarios are 

about 18 cm in most of the inlet area.  However there are some places where the differences are higher, 

for example, between the jetties (location of the station previously analysed), with values close to 20 cm. 

In the flood condition, the wave set-up decrease again to values of about 14 cm, nevertheless in the 

region close to the North jetty the differences are 16 cm.

 4.2.1.3. Neap Tide 

 The time series of SSE for the three scenarios under study for neap tide for station 1 is illustrated 

in Figure 24. Additionally, in order to get a better observation of the differences between the scenarios, the 

time series of the differences between all of them are illustrated in the lower panel. 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 As previously observed for the spring and intermediate tide conditions, the normal wave climate 

(scenario 1) has no influence in the sea surface elevation at the inlet and the storm regime scenario 

(scenario 2) shows a clear wave set-up. The difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 (visible in lower 

panel) in the high tide is 14.3 cm, while in the low tide is approximately 21.4 cm. As in the previous tidal 

regimes, the differences between the scenario 0 and 1 are negligible. In the high tide, those differences 

are 1 cm, while in the low tide are 0.65 cm. The lower panel of Figure 24 reinforces the idea that the 

Figure 24. Comparison between normal and storm regimes as well as the reference scenario, 

for neap tide condition (upper panel). The vertical lines correspond to instants chosen to 

illustrate horizontal sea surface elevation fields. In the lower panel is represented the 

differences between all the scenarios. 



Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  40 
 

scenario 1 has no significant influence in SSE at the inlet, because the differences between scenarios 2 

and 0 (blue line) are identical to the differences between scenarios 2 and 1 (green line). As expected, the 

differences between scenario 1 and 0 are close to 0, reaching a maximum of 1.6 cm. The analysis of 

Figure 24 shows, as in previous tidal conditions, that only the scenario 2 cause important changes in SSE. 

The influence of scenario 1 in the entire inlet area will be analysed, in more detail in Figure 25, that 

represents the horizontal fields of the differences of SSE between scenarios 0 and 1. Positive values 

mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 1 relatively to scenario 0.  

 As expected, the scenario 1 has no significant influence in SSE, because the difference between 

the scenarios never exceed 2 cm, being close to 0 in the majority of the instants studied.  Taking this into 

account, the horizontal fields of the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 were computed and are 

presented in Figure 26. Positive values mean that there is a wave set-up in the scenario 2 relatively to 

scenario 1.  

 In high tide (image A), the SSE differences between the scenarios are minimal, revealing a wave 

set-up in scenario 2 of 13 cm relatively to scenario 1. In this case, the differences are higher in the 

Northern zone of the inlet, reaching a value of about 18.6 cm. In ebb condition (image B), the differences 

between the scenarios are approximately 18 cm in the inlet entrance, increasing gradually along the inlet 

channel, reaching values of 19.5 cm. As mentioned before, the maximum values are found in low tide 

(image C), where the differences are about 22 cm. In flood condition, the wave set-up decreases, 

presenting values of 14 cm for all the inlet area. 

From the analysis performed for each tidal condition, was obtained the general pattern of the 

variations of SSE induced by the coastal waves. The results at the inlet reveal that the normal wave 

climate (scenario 1) has no influence in the sea surface elevation. For the storm regime scenario (scenario 

2) was found a clear over-elevation of the sea surface (wave set-up). These results are consistent with the 

findings of Malhadas et al. [2009] for the Óbidos lagoon that concluded that there is a correlation between 

the wave height and the sea-level elevation only during high wave activity periods, when a significant 

wave set-up on lagoon sea level is observed. 

 The waves effect observed in the results obtained for the numerical model simulations are in 

agreement with the effect of waves found in the analysis of field data (section 4.1). The field data analysis 

shows a maximum of set-up induced by the waves of approximately 21 cm for a wave with Hs of 8 meters. 

The model results evidence results of the same order of magnitude, however in same instants, the over-

elevation can reach values slightly higher than 25 cm. 

 The wave set-up found at the inlet in all the numerical results may be explained by the water 

gathering in the inlet zone caused by the constant wave propagation and consequently breaking inside the 

Ria de Aveiro inlet. The differences are higher during ebbing and consequently in the low tide, because in 

this case the waves propagation and tidal currents have opposing directions. In this circumstance there is 

a wave’s compression, with a decrease in their wavelength and an increase in their amplitude. Thus, in the 

normal regime the tide acts almost as a single forcing agent, while in the storm regime scenario the 

constant wave propagation in the opposite direction of the tidal currents causes higher water retention in 

the inlet. 

 All the study area is exposed to the wave set-up, however the most affected zone is the Barra 

beach. This may be explained by the Southwestard direction of the storm waves, causing water retention 

between the South jetty and the beach, producing a constant wave set-up in that zone. Contrarily, the 

Meia Laranja beach located in a sheltered zone is characterized by a lower set-up.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  43 
 

 These results in SSE may have a considerable impact in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. With the 

knowledge that the higher elevation induced by a storm surge registered in Ria de Aveiro was 1 meter, 

these values of wave set-up corresponds to approximately 20% of this value. Supposing that these wave 

set-up propagates into the lagoon, the margins of Ria de Aveiro may inundate. If the high wave climate 

coincides with a condition of spring tide, heavy rainfall and with the occurrence of a storm surge, the 

effects can be even higher. 

 It was also found that the effect of coastal waves at the Ria de Aveiro inlet is independent of tidal 

range, as there are no differences in the over-elevations determined for each tidal condition under study. 

  



Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  44 
 

 4.2.2. Current Velocity 

 In this section, the effect of the waves in the current velocity at Ria de Aveiro inlet is evaluated. 

Firstly, the velocities in the three scenarios are compared, through the representation of the horizontal 

fields in the same instants chosen to illustrate the horizontal SSE fields. Posteriorly, the horizontal fields of 

the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 are illustrated. All these analyses are performed for each tidal 

condition. 

 4.2.2.1. Spring Tide 

 The horizontal fields of the velocity intensity for the three scenarios, for the instants in study, are 

shown in Figure 27. To recall, the images A, B, C and D are illustrative of high tide, ebb condition, low tide 

and flood condition, respectively. 

 Starting with the comparison between scenario 0 (tide only) and scenario 1 (tide + normal wave 

climate), it was found that, in general, the waves considered in scenario 1 have no significant influence in 

the current velocity, due to the similarity between the patterns (in the inlet area) in scenario 0 and 1. The 

near shore zone is excluded of the analysis, because the goal of this study is focused in the inlet area. 

The other reason is that due to the waves breaking in the beaches, the velocity shows changes with 

chaotic patterns. 

 In images A of Figure 27, the current velocity has small values in the axis of the channel because 

this instant corresponds to a high tide period. The patterns and the order of magnitude of velocity in 

scenarios 0 and 1 are similar, however for high wave activity (scenario 2) a slight increase of the current 

velocity, reaching 1.3 ms-1 in the deeper areas of the inlet, is observed. 

 As expected, the current velocity in ebb condition (images B) is highest, reaching a value of 2.5 

ms-1. At the inlet area, the patterns and the order of magnitude of the current velocity are similar in 

scenarios 0 and 1. In scenario 0, the strong ebb current reaches the offshore zone, with velocities 

between 1.5 and 2 ms-1. An identical pattern is observed in scenario 1, nevertheless with lower intensity, 

because the tide and waves act as opposite forces, minimizing the current velocity. In scenario 2, the 

waves coming from SW ‘push’ the ebb current to North, increasing its magnitude, to values between 2 and 

2.5 ms-1. Into the inlet, the velocity has a slight increase in scenario 2 when compared with scenario 1. 

 In low tide (images C), the current velocity is smaller when compared with ebb condition. The 

current patterns between scenario 0 and 1 are similar, with velocities of about 0.8 ms-1 in the axis of the 

channel. In the scenario 2, the patterns remain identical, with a slight increase of the velocity.  

In the flood condition (images D), the comparison of current velocity between scenarios 0 and 1 in 

the interior of the inlet, show that the waves of scenario 1 have no influence in the current velocity. Thus, 

in scenarios 0 and 1, the velocity reaches maximum values of 1.8 ms-1 in the deeper areas of the inlet. In 

scenario 2, the velocity patterns are similar, however there is an increase of velocity, reaching 2.0 ms-1. In 

this scenario, it are observed high velocities for all channel width, consequently the velocities in the inlet 

margins are higher when compared to those found for the scenarios 0 and 1. 

 From the analysis of Figure 27 it can be verified that in scenario 1 the tidal currents have more 

influence than the currents induced by waves. Nevertheless, in scenario 2 the presence of a combined 

effect of tidal currents and waves is observed. Then, the horizontal fields of the differences of current 

velocities between scenarios 1 and 2 are represented in Figure 28. Positive values represent higher 

velocities in the scenario 2, while negative values denote that the velocity is higher in the scenario 1.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  46 
 

 Figure 28 A represents the difference between the scenarios 1 and 2 in the high tide. In this 

condition, the storm waves coming from SW increases the current velocity close to the South jetty and in 

the axis of the channel (deeper areas), where the velocity differences reaches 0.35 ms-1. Out of the central 

region of the inlet, the velocities are higher in the scenario 1, reaching a maximum difference of 0.33 ms-1, 

close to the North jetty. 

 The horizontal field of the differences of current velocity at ebb condition represented in Figure 28 

B, indicates that the currents induced by waves have lower importance when compared with the tidal 

currents, which in the ebb condition are very strong. Thus, in the offshore zone exists an area Northern of 

the inlet where the velocity is higher in scenario 2 (difference of 0.6 ms-1), while Southern of the inlet the 

velocity is higher in scenario 1. This is justified by the ebb current that comes out the inlet. In scenario 1, 

the ebb current has the same orientation of the jetties, while in scenario 2 the waves coming from SW, 

‘push’ the ebb current to North. Inside the inlet, the differences between the scenarios are constant, 

revealing an increase of velocity of 0.1 ms-1, for scenario 2, in the entire study area. The exception is close 

to Meia Laranja beach, where the velocity is higher in scenario 1. 

 The image C (low tide) illustrates the same velocity patterns, inside the inlet, when compared to 

the ebb condition (image B). With exception to the area close to Meia Laranja beach, the velocity in 

scenario 2 is higher comparing with scenario 1. The difference value is uniform for all the inlet area (0.1 

ms-1).  

 In flood condition (image D), the differences are higher when compared to low tide. Close to the 

North jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 2, revealing differences of 0.39 ms-1. This may be explained 

due to the combined effect of flood current with the SW storm waves that break in the North jetty, leading 

to an increase of the velocity in this area. In most of the central channel of the inlet, the velocity increases 

about 0.15 ms-1 in scenario 2. On the other hand, in the region close to the South jetty, the velocity is 

higher in the scenario 1, because the waves coming to NW breaks in the South jetty, increasing the 

velocity in this zone.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  48 
 

 4.2.2.2. Intermediate Tide 

 The horizontal fields of the current velocity for the three scenarios are illustrated in Figure 29, for 

the instants in study. The images A to D correspond to the high tide, ebb condition, low tide and flood 

condition, respectively. 

 In general, comparing the three scenarios, it is verified that the velocity patterns found in scenario 

0 (tide only) and in scenario 1 (tide + normal wave climate) are similar. Comparing the scenario 2 (tide + 

storm wave climate) with the other scenarios in study, some changes in the velocity patterns are 

observed, mainly in images B and D, corresponding to ebb and flood condition, respectively.  

 In high tide (images A), the difference between the three scenarios is negligible. Into the inlet 

area, in the central zone of the channel, the velocity is about 1.0 ms-1, reaching values of 1.3 ms-1 in some 

restricted areas (deeper zones).  

 The image B shows, as in spring tide, a strong ebb current in the central channel, with velocities 

between 1.5 and 1.65 ms-1, reaching 1.9 ms-1 in the deepest area of the inlet. Although inside the inlet 

there is a slight increase of the velocity in the scenario 2, what becomes evident is the ebb current being 

‘pushed’ to North due the SW storm waves. This pattern was also observed in spring tide condition. 

 In low tide (images C), the current velocity is lower than the verified in the ebb condition. In the 

scenarios 0 and 1, the velocity in the axis of the inlet ranges between 0.47 and 0.61 ms-1. The velocity 

patterns between these two scenarios are similar. The main difference is, due the NW waves, the tidal 

current in scenario 1 is pushed Southward, incrementing the velocities close to the South jetty (maximum 

of 1.06 ms-1). The opposite pattern is observed in scenario 2, leading to high velocities near the North jetty 

(1.59 ms-1). Into the inlet area the velocity is higher in scenario 2 (about 0.1 ms-1).  

 In images D, corresponding to flood condition, the velocity pattern between scenarios 0 and 1 is 

similar. In most areas of the inlet, the velocity magnitude ranges between 1.01 and 1.21 ms-1, with 

exception of the deepest zone of the inlet, where the velocity is 1.44 ms-1. Comparing the scenario 2 with 

the scenarios 0 and 1, the differences are clear.  

 Thus, in order to study the differences between scenario 1 and 2, and since there are no 

considerable differences between scenarios 0 and 1, the horizontal fields of the current velocity 

differences between scenarios 1 and 2 is computed and illustrated in Figure 30. As in the previous tidal 

condition, positive values represent higher velocities in the scenario 2, while negative values denote that 

the velocity is higher in the scenario 1. 

 Figure 30 A shows small differences between scenarios 1 and 2, however in the upper region of 

the inlet, the velocities are higher in scenario 1. The magnitude of the difference is 0.07 ms-1, reaching a 

maximum of 0.28 ms-1 between the jetties. In the Southest area of the inlet, the scenario 2 presents higher 

velocities (0.04 ms-1). 

In ebb condition (Figure 30 B), the velocity in scenario 2 is higher in all the inlet area, with 

differences ranging between 0.02 and 0.08 ms-1. Close to the North jetty, the difference is about 0.45 ms-1, 

while in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.16 ms-1). This might be justified by the 

inflection of the ebb current forced by the orientation of the storm waves.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  50 
 

 As mentioned and explained in the analysis of Figure 29, in low tide, the direction of the waves in 

scenarios 1 and 2 are very relevant. In scenario 1 the tidal current is pushed Southward, incrementing the 

velocities close to the South jetty, while in scenario 2 the opposite pattern is observed, leading to high 

velocities near the North jetty. Consequently, it is observed in Figure 30 C that the velocity close to North 

jetty is higher in scenario 2 (0.43 ms-1) while in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.47 

ms-1). In the remaining inlet region, the velocity is higher in the scenario 2, with differences ranging 

between 0.04 ms-1 and 1.1 ms-1. 

 The differences between the scenarios in the flood condition (Figure 30 D) are considerable. In 

the axis of the inlet channel, the velocity is higher in scenario 2 with a magnitude difference of 0.53 ms-1 

close to the South jetty, decreasing gradually into the inlet, achieving differences of about 0.18 ms-1 in its 

upstream zone. Close to the North jetty the velocity is higher in scenario 1, where the maximum 

differences reach 0.51 ms-1.

 4.2.2.3. Neap Tide 

 The horizontal fields of the velocity for the three scenarios in study are computed and illustrated 

in Figure 31, for high tide (A), ebb condition (B), low tide (C) and flood condition (D). 

 The first analysis of the Figure indicates, as expected, that the current velocity in the neap tide is 

significantly lower when compared with spring and intermediate tidal conditions. It is important to note that 

the scale adopted in Figure 31 is different of the one used in Figures 27 and 29. 

 In Figure 31 A, is observed a slight increase of current velocity in scenario 1 when compared with 

scenario 0. However major differences are observed in scenario 2, in comparison with scenarios 0 and 1. 

In the central axis of the channel, in scenario 1, the velocity range between 0.41 and 0.46 ms-1. In scenario 

2, the region where the velocity is higher is in the Northern area of the inlet: 0.85 ms-1, reaching a 

maximum of 0.96 ms-1. In the central area, the velocity is close to 0 ms-1, while in the Southern area, the 

velocity increases again to values around 0.62 ms-1. Thus, the differences between scenario 2 and the 

reference scenario (0) seem clear. 

 In the ebb condition (images B), the patterns found in scenarios 0 and 1 are similar. In the central 

zone of the channel, the velocity range between 0.67 and 0.82 ms-1, decreasing between the jetties, with 

values of about 0.48 ms-1. In scenario 2, the current patterns are identical, however an increase of velocity 

is observed. In the axis of the channel, the velocity range between 0.72 and 0.84 ms-1, while between the 

jetties the velocity is approximately 0.79 ms-1 close to the North jetty and 0.45 ms-1 near the South one. 

 In the low tide (images C), the velocity patterns inside the inlet for the three scenarios are similar. 

The velocities are lower when compared with the ebb condition, and are relatively constant in the central 

channel of the inlet, with values of about 0.30 ms-1.  

 In the flood condition (images D), the velocity increases again. The velocity patterns between 

scenarios 0 and 1 are similar. However, in scenario 1, the velocity is higher when compared with reference 

scenario (scenario 0). In scenario 0, the velocity is about 0.55 ms-1 in the major part of the channel, 

reaching a maximum of 0.75 ms-1. In scenario 1, the velocity in the central channel range between 0.57 

and 0.65 ms-1, reaching a maximum of 0.84 ms-1. Nevertheless, the highest differences are observed in 

scenario 2. The waves coming from SW ‘push’ the flood current to the Northern zone of the inlet, leading 

to a substantial velocity increase in this area, reaching a value of 1.034 ms-1. Consequently, the velocity in 

the Southern area of the inlet is smaller (close to 0.1 ms-1) when compared with scenario 1. 

 Based on these results, the horizontal fields of the current velocity differences between scenarios 

1 and 2 are represented in Figure 32. Positive values represent higher velocities in the scenario 2, while 

negative values means that the velocity is higher in the scenario 1. 

As mentioned in the analysis of Figure 31 A, corresponding to the high tide, the scenario 2 

reveals a considerable increase of the velocity Northern of the inlet channel, a decrease in the centre and 

an increase in the Southern area of the inlet. As expected, this pattern is observed in the horizontal fields 

of the current velocity differences between scenarios 1 and 2. In the Northern area of the channel, the 

velocity is higher in scenario 2 with values of 0.44 ms-1, reaching a maximum of 0.72 ms-1. In the central 

area, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (maximum of 0.38 ms-1), while in the Southern area of the 

channel, the velocity is higher in scenario 2, with a value of 0.41 ms-1.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  54 
 

 In ebb condition (Figure 32 B), the velocity, in scenario 2, is higher in the entire inlet area, with 

exception to the zone close to South jetty. In more detail, close to the North jetty major differences are 

observed (0.77 ms-1). Close to the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 1 (0.20 ms-1). In the central 

channel of the inlet, the difference between the scenarios never exceeds 0.1 ms-1, with the exception of 

the Southern zone, where the velocity difference can reach 0.21 ms-1. 

 In Figure 32 C, corresponding to low tide, the difference between the scenarios inside the inlet is 

not significant. More specifically, as in previous tidal conditions, the velocity in the North jetty is higher in 

scenario 2 (0.57 ms-1). On the other hand, in South jetty the velocity is higher in the normal wave climate 

scenario, with a difference of about 0.27 ms-1. In the central area of the channel, the differences range 

between 0.02 (higher in scenario 2) and -0.02 ms-1 (higher in scenario 1). Then, it was found that, inside 

the inlet there are no important differences between the scenarios in this situation. 

 As mentioned before, in the flood tide situation (Figure 32 D), in scenario 2, the waves coming 

from SW ‘push’ the flood current to the Northern region of the inlet, with a significant increase of the 

velocity in this area (0.35 ms-1). On the other hand, in scenario 1, the flood current enters in the lagoon in 

the central area, thus the velocity in this zone is higher in scenario 1 (maximum of 0.47 ms-1). Close to the 

jetties, the velocity is higher in scenario 2. In the North jetty, the difference is about 0.35 ms-1, although in 

the South one, the difference is 0.57 ms-1. Between the jetties, the velocity is higher in scenario 1, 

reaching a maximum of 0.39 ms-1. 

From the analysis performed for each tidal condition, can be discussed the general patterns of 

the current velocity induced by the coastal waves. The pattern of the velocities difference between the 

scenarios is not as well defined as that found for the sea surface elevation. The regions with higher 

differences between the scenarios are offshore the inlet and near shore, Northward and Southward the 

inlet. This is justified considering that there are important differences in the current velocities in the 

breaking zone (where they show a chaotic pattern), which are dependent on the characteristics of the 

waves adopted for each scenario. 

 From the analysis of the previous results it was found that the currents in the Ria de Aveiro inlet 

are mainly tidal currents, however the currents induced by storm waves must be taken into account. In 

reality, it was verified that the currents induced by the waves interacts with the tidal currents, modifying its 

magnitude and direction. Therefore, the direction of the waves is an important factor, because it was 

observed that the waves can cause changes in the main flow direction. 

In general, it was observed that, in the majority of situations analysed, the high wave climate 

(scenario 2) increases the velocity inside the inlet. This may be explained considering that the wave set-up 

caused by the storm waves (studied in subsection 5.2.1) creates a higher gradient pressure between the 

offshore sea level and the lagoon sea level, and consequently the velocity increases. 

 Other important pattern found in the majority of situations studied is that the velocity, in scenario 

2, is higher close to the North jetty. On the other hand, in the South jetty, the velocity is higher in scenario 

1. This happens because the waves in scenario 1 are Southward, breaking in the South jetty, whereas the 

waves coming from SW, in the high wave scenario breaks against the North jetty, increasing the velocity 

surrounding this zone.  

In some shallow zones, for example in Meia Laranja beach, the velocity in some instants is higher 

for scenario 1. In this case, due the low depth of these areas, the velocity will be lower in scenario 2, since 

the increase in the total water column height is higher, and therefore by continuity the velocity will 

decrease.

Wave Effect in the Aveiro Inlet  56 
 

 These results may have an important effect, for instance, in the sediment transport, because the 

changes in the current velocity may modify the patterns in its transport. In fact, the scientific community 

have it into regard. In Ria de Aveiro, the majority of the morphodynamics studies take into account the 

tidal forcing as well as the coastal waves. As example, Plecha et al. [2011], performed the evaluation of 

single waves effects on the morphologic evolution of a Ria de Aveiro lagoon inlet, concluding that the 

wave induced residual sediment fluxes in the cross sections upstream the lagoon mouth are smaller in 

magnitude than at the inlet, restricting the influence of the waves to the lagoon mouth and adjacent 

coastline.



Conclusions and Future Improvements  57 
 

5. Conclusions and Future Improvements 

 The main goal of this work was to study the influence of the wave regime on the hydrodynamics 

of Ria de Aveiro inlet through the analysis of field data and numerical modeling results. With this purpose, 

the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D has been used. This modeling system integrates, 

in this study, the hydrodynamic model ELCIRC and the wave model SWAN, that was successfully applied 

to research the integrated effect of tidal and wave effects.  

 The hydrodynamic model ELCIRC was previously implemented in the Ria de Aveiro by Picado 

[2008], in order to understand the consequences of the partial salt pans walls destruction on the entire Ria 

de Aveiro lagoon hydrodynamics. The bathymetry used by the author was successfully updated with a 

recent bathymetry data set. Picado [2008] had also developed a horizontal grid which resolution was 

insufficient for the present work, because the grid had insufficient resolution in the offshore zone. For that 

reason and taking into account the main aim of this work the existing grid was improved, refining the 

offshore and the inlet zone, where this work is focused. 

 Several model runs were performed to calibrate the numerical model, by adjusting the bottom 

stress in order to reduce the differences between the available data and model results. According to the 

final results, the model was considered successfully calibrated for a very complex system as Ria de 

Aveiro. The results of the calibration in the inlet should be considered excellent. In the upstream channels, 

the agreement between the observations and model results is smaller when compared to the calibration 

results in the inlet. These differences are due to several factors, such as very narrow lagoon channels that 

are not well resolved by the horizontal model grid, and some possible uncertainties in the field data, as 

well as due to possible inaccuracies in the bathymetry. The temporal discrepancy between the data and 

predictions is also an important factor for the higher disagreement in the upper stations of the lagoon. 

 Once calibrated the ELCIRC component, the 2DH morphodynamic modeling system MORSYS2D 

was used to understand the effect of the coastal waves in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. Different 

scenarios were defined: scenario with the absence of waves and wind; normal wave climate scenario and 

high wave climate scenario. In order to achieve the main goal of this study, the sea surface elevation and 

current velocity were analysed for all the scenarios in study.   

 The results found under the wave regime forcing show that for the low wave activity scenario 

(normal regime) the inlet hydrodynamics is mainly dominated by the tidal forcing. For the highest wave 

regime are found higher sea surface elevations at the inlet induced by the wave set-up when compared 

with simulations performed only with tidal forcing or with the normal regime. In fact, the modelling results 

show that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea level during storm wave periods. The wave 

set-up found at the inlet in all the numerical results may be explained by the gathering of water in the inlet 

zone caused by the constant wave propagation and consequently breaking inside the Ria de Aveiro inlet. 

The differences are higher during ebbing and consequently in the low tide, because in this case the waves 

propagation and tidal currents have opposing directions. In this case there is a wave’s compression, with a 

decrease in their wavelength and an increase in their amplitude. 

 The currents induced by the waves interact with the tidal currents, modifying its characteristics 

such as the magnitude and the direction of the predominant flow. In summary, due to wave set-up, the 

waves cause a slight increase of the current velocity in the inlet area. 

 Although the dominant forcing of the Ria de Aveiro inlet hydrodynamics is the tide, it may be 

concluded that the sea level and current velocity fluctuations at the Ria de Aveiro inlet depend also on the 

wave regime. Consequently, the storm events induce important waves set-up that change the inlet

hydrodynamics, requiring that the coupling between waves and tides should be considered to represent 

accurately the processes which depend on the inlet dynamics. 

 As mentioned in introduction chapter, this is the first study that aims to research the influence of 

the waves in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics. For that reason, this work may constitute a starting point for 

further studies and improvements in the study of this subject. As example, it would be interesting to study 

how the over-elevation at the inlet caused by the waves propagates into the lagoon. 

 Dias and Mariano [2011] evaluated the hydrodynamic response of Ria de Aveiro to an extension 

by 200 meters of the north jetty, that is being presently implemented. Based on this study, it is of crucial 

importance to include the combined effect of tide and waves on modelling simulations in order to 

understand the influence of this coastal work in the hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro inlet. Another 

important issue to research in the future consists in performing a sensitivity analysis in order to understand 

which is the most important wave component (Hs, direction or period) that causes the wave set-up in the 

lagoon, as well as what will be there relevant threshold values. 

 As referred in the introduction chapter (Section 1.1), the economic and environmental importance 

of tidal inlets has been growing worldwide. The Ria de Aveiro is an unmistakable example of this due to 

harbouring important commercial and fishing ports, and because many social and sportive activities are 

concentrated in the inlet area. Thus, the improvement of the knowledge of the processes that occur in the 

zone is crucial to the development of the economic activities surrounding these areas, as well as to the 

people who live around this region and enjoy its activities.
