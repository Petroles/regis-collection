RESUMO 

A Planície Costeira do estado do Rio Grande do Sul (PCRS) foi estruturada ao longo do 

Quaternário por sucessivas oscilações do nível do mar. Alem das oscilações eustáticas, o 

clima também afetou a região, influenciando nos padrões deposicionais representados pelas 

fácies expostas em afloramentos e na distribuição dos organismos. O objetivo da presente tese 

é reconstituir condições climáticas e ambientes da região durante o Pleistoceno tardio, a partir 

de levantamentos estratigráficos, sedimentologia, datações, e análises de fósseis. A área 

escolhida para o desenvolvimento da tese foi o Arroio Chuí, localizado no sul da PCRS entre 

as barreiras II e III, onde afloram seqüências deposicionais que representam ambientes 

marinho e terrestre. Os resultados mostram que a porção marinha da seqüência exposta ao 

longo do arroio representa a fácies marinha do sistema deposicional Laguna-Barreira II. 

Datações em sedimentos e conchas de bivalves coletados nesta fácies indicam que este 

sistema teria sido formado pelo máximo transgressivo marinho ocorrido durante o estágio 

isotópico marinho (MIS) 7, há aproximadamente 230 mil anos. As temperaturas do oceano na 

região durante esse intervalo eram mais quentes do que nos dias de hoje, como evidenciado 

por espécies de moluscos bivalves e foraminíferos indicativos de águas mais quentes. A 

camada acima da fácies marinha representa paleossolos e antigos sistemas fluviais, onde 

ficaram preservados fósseis de grandes mamíferos. Datações feitas nos fósseis desses animais 

mostraram idades entre 226 e 34 mil anos; análises de isótopos estáveis (13C e 18O) em dentes 

fósseis mostram que o ambiente era caracterizado por pradarias compostas por gramíneas, 

arbustos e possivelmente matas de galeria. As características sedimentológicas mostram 

intercalações entre períodos mais úmidos e outros mais secos. Na camada acima do horizonte 

que contem os restos de grandes mamíferos não foram encontrados fósseis ate agora, e o 

aumento na quantidade de silte e presença de nódulos e concreções carbonáticas indicam 

clima mais seco, provavelmente relacionado ao ultimo máximo glacial (LGM).

ABSTRACT 

 

The Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS) was formed during the Quaternary by 

successive sea-level oscillations. Besides the eustatic oscillations, the region was also affected 

by climate changes, which influenced the depositional patterns represented by the facies 

exposed along outcrops and the distribution of organisms. The objective of this thesis is to 

reconstruct late Pleistocene climate conditions and environments of the region, using 

stratigraphic surveys, sedimentology, datings ands analysis on fossils. The area chosen for 

this work was the Chui Creek, located in the southern CPRS between the barriers II and III, 

where depositional sequences that represent marine and terrestrial environments are exposed. 

The results show that the marine portion of the sequence exposed along the banks of the creek 

represents the marine facies of the depositional system Barrier-Lagoon II. Datings on 

sediments and bivalve shells from this facies indicate that this system would have been 

formed by the marine highstand during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 7, around 230 

thousand years ago. The ocean temperatures during this interval were higher than today, as 

indicated by bivalves and foraminifers that indicate warmer waters. The layer above the 

marine facies represents paleosoils, and ancient fluvial systems where fossils of large 

mammals were preserved. Datings on these fossils revealed ages between 226 and 34 

thousand years; analyses of stable isotopes (13C and 18O) in fossil teeth showed that the 

landscape consisted of prairies composed by grasses, shrubs and possibly gallery forests. The 

sedimentary record show intercalated humid and dry periods. The layer above the horizon 

with large mammalian remains provided no fossils so far, and the increase in silt-sized 

particles and the presence of carbonate nodules and concretions indicate very dry conditions, 

probably correlated with the last glacial maximum (LGM).

INTRODUÇÃO 

1 - Generalidades 

 O clima é um sistema complexo resultante da interação entre a atmosfera, superfícies 

emersas, neve e gelo, oceanos e outros corpos d’água, e seres vivos. Pode ser definido como a 

expressão estatística das condições climáticas diárias, e é geralmente descrito em termos da 

média e variabilidade de temperatura, precipitação e ventos ao longo de períodos de pelo 

menos 30 anos (Bradley, 1999). Os padrões climáticos resultam do balanço entre a radiação 

solar absorvida e refletida, bem como a emissão absorção e transporte da energia pela 

atmosfera e oceanos, e configuração e natureza da superfície sólida da Terra (massas 

continentais) (Hay, 1996). O sistema climático se modifica ao longo do tempo influenciado 

por sua própria dinâmica interna e por alterações nos fatores externos (forçantes climáticas). 

Estes incluem fenômenos como erupções vulcânicas e variações na atividade solar. Em 

décadas recentes, descobriu-se que atividades humanas também têm afetado os padrões 

climáticos (Le Treut et al., 2007). 

O clima da Terra tem oscilado continuamente ao longo da sua história; uma vez que os 

padrões climáticos influenciam diversos fenômenos naturais relacionados ao clima, como 

precipitação, circulação oceânica e atmosférica, padrões deposicionais, e processos 

biológicos, os efeitos do clima sobre esses fenômenos ficam documentados nos registros 

naturais. As principais fontes de informações paleoclimáticas são geológicas (paleossolos, 

espeleotemas, depósitos eólicos, etc.), glaciológicas (gases e elementos traços aprisionados no 

gelo, composição do gelo, etc.), biológicas (palinomorfos, anéis de crescimento em árvores, 

insetos, corais etc.) e químicas (isótopos estáveis em rochas e materiais orgânicos). Além 

destas podem ser também utilizadas fontes históricas, mas como estas abrangem um intervalo 

de tempo muito curto da história da Terra, têm aplicações limitadas. Estudando-se esses 

registros é possível reconstituir as condições climáticas do passado em extensas escalas de 

tempo, o que permite visualizar ciclos e padrões, que servem de base para projetar condições 

climáticas futuras, bem como anomalias. A Paleoclimatologia dedica-se ao estudo das 

condições climáticas que têm afetado o planeta em épocas anteriores à adoção de observações 

e registros sistemáticos e instrumentos, e para isso utiliza-se de registros paleoclimáticos 

encontrados na natureza. 

As variações climáticas são resultado basicamente de processos que atuam em escalas 

de tempo distintas, e podem ser divididas em três categorias: oscilações de longo prazo 

(ocorrem em escalas de aproximadamente 106 a 107 anos), oscilações de curto prazo (em 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       4 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
escalas de 104 a 105 anos) e aberrações (escalas de 103 a 104 anos) (Zachos et al., 2001). As 

variações climáticas de longo prazo são controladas por processos contínuos que atuam em 

amplas escalas temporais (condições-limites), basicamente condicionados pela tectônica 

global, como abertura ou fechamento de passagens oceânicas (Haug &amp;amp; Tiedemann, 1998; 

Lawver &amp;amp; Gahagan, 2003), geografia e topografia continentais (Ramstein et al., 1997; Hay, 

1996) e concentração de gases do efeito estufa (Petit et al., 1999; Pearson &amp;amp; Palmer, 2006; 

Zachos et al., 2008). Uma vez que a tectônica é um processo contínuo e unidirecional, tais 

variações não são cíclicas, e se estendem ao longo de milhões de anos. 

 Oscilações climáticas cíclicas, em freqüências da ordem de 104 a 105 anos, são 

controladas basicamente por oscilações periódicas ou quase periódicas de três parâmetros 

orbitais, que constituem os Ciclos de Milankovich (Hays et al., 1976): 

Excentricidade - oscila em períodos de 400 e 100 ka. Este parâmetro caracteriza a variação da 

forma da órbita da Terra ao redor do Sol, de elíptica (máxima excentricidade) a quase circular 

(excentricidade mínima). Essa variação altera a distância média entre o planeta e o Sol, mas 

seu efeito sobre a taxa de insolação é muito pequeno. 

Obliquidade - oscila em períodos de 41 ka, e descreve a inclinação do eixo de rotação da 

Terra em relação ao plano da eclíptica, que varia entre 22,1º e 24,5º.Quanto maior o ângulo de 

inclinação do eixo, maior o contraste entre as estações, especialmente em altas latitudes. 

Precessão – o ciclo precessional ocorre em função da rotação do eixo do planeta, e tem uma 

periodicidade de 26 ka. Contudo, é modulado pela excentricidade, resultando em sinais 

climáticos com periodicidade de 23 e 19 ka. Determina em que pontos ao longo da órbita irão 

ocorrer as estações, amplificando a sazonalidade em um hemisfério e reduzindo no outro.  

 

2 – O clima na América do Sul entre o Pleistoceno Tardio e Holoceno 

 Diversos registros sedimentológicos, geomorfológicos e paleontológicos são 

indicativos das condições climáticas no continente sul-americano desde o final do 

Pleistoceno. Em resposta às oscilações climáticas relacionadas aos ciclos glaciais-

interglaciais, o continente passou por marcantes alterações na paisagem e ecossistemas, que se 

refletem nos ambientes atuais.  

 O clima da América do Sul é fortemente condicionado por sua conformação 

geográfica e topografia. Os oceanos que cercam o continente exercem profunda influência 

sobre o clima, modulando flutuações extremas de temperatura e grandes diferenças 

meteorológicas entre verão e inverno. A porção norte está na área de influência de correntes 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       5 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
oceânicas quentes, que chegam até 36oS na margem atlântica e ao Equador na margem 

pacífica, o que resulta em forte assimetria latitudinal em grande escala. O extremo sul é 

influenciado pela Corrente Circum-Antártica (ACC); um ramo dessa corrente sobe pela costa 

atlântica, formando a Corrente das Malvinas; outro, de maior proporção, sobe pela costa 

pacífica, formando a Corrente de Humboldt. A Cordilheira dos Andes, com 8 mil km de 

extensão e entre 200 e 400 km de largura, tem o efeito de uma barreira climática, que mantém 

boa parte do interior do continente situada a leste da cordilheira isolada da influência do 

oceano Pacífico. Os principais componentes meteorológicos que afetam os padrões climáticos 

regionais são a Zona de Convergência Intertropical (ITCZ), os ventos alísios, o Anticiclone do 

Pacífico Sul (SPA), Anticiclone do Atlântico Sul (SAA) e o Anticiclone dos Açores (AA) 

(Iriondo, 1999).  

  Devido à conformação geomorfológica e topográfica, na América do Sul as únicas 

áreas sujeitas a cobertura por mantos de gelo durante os máximos glaciais foram as áreas do 

extremo sul do Chile e Argentina (da Patagônia à Terra do Fogo) e os picos montanhosos 

mais altos. A formação dessas coberturas teria sido condicionada principalmente pela 

disponibilidade de umidade (precipitação); devido ao ambiente mais seco, mesmo nos picos 

mais elevados dos Andes Bolivianos, com altitudes superiores a 5.500 metros, nunca se 

desenvolveram glaciares (Clapperton, 1993).  

Os períodos glaciais ocorridos nas altas latitudes estão relacionados a episódios de 

intensa atividade eólica (aridez) nas baixas latitudes do Hemisfério Sul. Registros na 

Austrália, África e América do Sul mostram que fases de aridificação ocorreram entre 65 e 8 

ka AP, com maior frequência entre 32 e 8 ka AP; entre 41 e 36 ka, nos três continentes é 

registrada redução na atividade eólica (Munyikwa, 2005). Na América do Sul episódios de 

aridificação são representados por dunas fósseis na Bacia do Rio Negro, Rio São Francisco e 

camadas de loess e areia na Região Pampeana da Argentina (Tatumi et al., 2002; Oliveira, 

1999). A intensa aridificação e deflação eólica observadas nos intervalos glaciais estão 

associadas aos efeitos combinados do clima antártico sobre a ACC e o sistema de ventos 

oriundos do Pacífico (westerlies). O maior resfriamento da Antártica durante os máximos 

glaciais, resultou no deslocamento do sistema ACC-westerlies em direção ao equador. 

Durante o estágio isotópico marinho (MIS) 4, entre 74 e 60 mil anos atrás, o deslocamento foi 

de aproximadamente 5º-6º, e no MIS , entre 24 e 11 mil anos atrás, em torno de 4º-5º; durante 

esses episódios a ACC teria atingido até 33º S de latitude. Durante os interglaciais, o 

aquecimento da Antártica teve efeito inverso, com a retração latitudinal em direção ao Pólo 

Sul do sistema ACC-westerlies (Kaiser et al., 2005). Na costa chilena, os avanços do sistema 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       6 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
tiveram como resultado a intensificação da precipitação e consequente expansão das florestas 

úmidas para o norte (Heusser et al., 2006).  

No sul do Brasil ainda são poucos os estudos relativos às condições climáticas e 

ambientais do Quaternário. As principais contribuições nesse sentido vêm de estudos de 

palinomorfos obtidos em diversas localidades (Ledru et al., 1996; Behling, 2002; Behling et 

al., 2004; 2005; Leonhardt &amp;amp; Lorscheitter, 2010).  

 

3 – Objetivos  

 Estudos feitos no sul da Planície Costeira do Rio Grande do Sul (PCRS) ao longo dos 

últimos anos têm levantado diversas questões relacionada aos registros sedimentares e fósseis 

aí encontrados: 

• As variações faciológicas encontradas no sul da PCRS estariam relacionadas a 

condições climáticas distintas das atuais durante a deposição das unidades geológicas? 

• Que condições climáticas estariam representadas nos depósitos sedimentares da 

PCRS? 

• De que forma as variações climáticas poderiam ter influenciado os registros 

sedimentares encontrados? 

• Quais mecanismos poderiam ter influenciado o clima durante o intervalo abordado? 

• Como a fauna teria sido afetada pelas variações climáticas decorrentes dos ciclos 

glaciais? 

• Como as variações nos ambientes observadas nos registros geológicos se relacionam 

com registros encontrados em outros locais? 

Estas questões são bastante amplas e podem ser abordadas por diferentes ângulos, mas 

aqui buscou-se obter respostas a partir dos registros sedimentares e paleontológicos 

encontrados na área de estudo, que compreende basicamente os depósitos expostos ao longo 

das barrancas do Arroio Chuí. 

O objetivo geral desta tese é analisar os registros geológicos e paleontológicos 

preservados no sul da Planície Costeira do Rio Grande do Sul (PCRS), a fim de identificar 

indicadores paleoclimáticos e avaliar como as variações climáticas do Quaternário exerceram 

influência sobre a evolução geológica e ambiental da região.  

Espera-se com o cumprimento deste objetivo contribuir para a compreensão dos 

climas e ambientes do sul do Brasil no intervalo entre o Pleistoceno tardio e o Holoceno, 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       7 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
avaliando como as oscilações do clima afetam o meio físico e biota e eventualmente gerando 

subsídios para prever como mudanças climáticas futuras podem influenciar a região. 

4 – Área de estudo 

 A área definida para este trabalho está situada no extremo sul da PCRS (Figura 1). 

Nesta área, estão representados essencialmente três dos grandes conjuntos de sistemas 

deposicionais do tipo laguna-barreira que constituem os depósitos quaternários da PCRS 

(Villwock &amp;amp; Tomazelli, 1995). Os sistemas aí encontrados englobam dois de idade 

pleistocênica (Laguna-Barreira II e III) e o sistema holocênico (Laguna-Barreira IV). Cada 

um destes é caracterizado essencialmente por extensas barreiras arenosas que representam 

ambientes marinho raso e eólico costeiro; estas barreiras isolam os depósitos correspondentes 

aos sistemas lagunares, que atualmente são representados pela Lagoa Mirim (Lagunar II), 

banhados e o Arroio Chuí (Lagunar III) e Lagoa Mangueira e banhados associados (Lagunar 

IV). 

 O local escolhido para a realização dos estudos da tese foi o Arroio Chuí, localizado 

próximo à cidade de Santa Vitória do Palmar. O Arroio nasce no Banhado dos Canelões e flui 

pela planície formada entre as barreiras II e III, e que corresponde ao sistema Lagunar III. Até 

a década de 60, o arroio era um curso d’água mais largo e raso do que atualmente (Figura 2), 

mas em 1963 foi dragado para aprofundamento e modificação do curso com objetivos 

agrícolas. Durante as escavações do arroio, foram expostas camadas sedimentares ao longo 

das barrancas, que representam a evolução geológica deste sistema deposicional e contêm 

importantes registros paleontológicos (Paula Couto &amp;amp; Cunha, 1965; Lopes et al., 2009). 

 

5 – Organização do trabalho 

 A tese foi elaborada na forma de artigos científicos integrados, conforme a resolução 

002/98 do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Geociências da Universidade Federal do Rio 

Grande do Sul (PPGGEO-UFRGS). Os artigos que integram a tese incluem dois já 

publicados, e outros três submetidos, além de resumos de trabalhos referentes à tese 

apresentados em congressos. 

O Capítulo I abrange basicamente o paleo-ambiente marinho, e consiste de três 

manuscritos submetidos. O primeiro, intitulado “THE SEA-LEVEL HIGHSTAND 

CORRELATED TO MARINE ISOTOPE STAGE (MIS) 7 IN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF 

RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, BRAZIL”, foi submetido aos Anais da Academia 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       8

 O segundo artigo, intitulado “A PLEISTOCENE MARINE MOLLUSCAN 

ASSEMBLAGE FROM THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL 

STATE, BRAZIL”, foi submetido à Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia. Aqui é descrita a 

assembléia de moluscos fósseis encontrada na fácies marinha, seus aspectos tafonômicos, 

inferências relativas ao ambiente deposicional em que as conchas foram preservadas, e suas 

implicações paleo-climáticas.  

O terceiro artigo, “ESR DATINGS ON PLEISTOCENE MAMMALS AND MARINE 

SHELLS FROM THE COASTAL PLAIN OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL STATE, 

SOUTHERN BRAZIL” foi aceito para publicação no Quaternary International; aqui são 

descritos os resultados de novas datações feitas em fósseis de mamíferos encontrados no 

arroio e da datação feita nas conchas encontradas na fácies marinha. 

Este capítulo inclui ainda o resumo “FORAMINÍFEROS EM SEDIMENTOS 

PLEISTOCÊNICOS NO SUL DA PLANÍCIE COSTEIRA DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL”, 

apresentado na forma de pôster durante a reunião anual da Sociedade Brasileira de 

Paleontologia (PALEO 2012), onde é descrita a composição taxonômica da assembléia de 

foraminíferos encontrada junto com as conchas da fácies marinha, bem como suas 

implicações paleo-climáticas. 

O Capítulo II abrange basicamente o paleo-ambiente terrestre, e inclui os artigos 

“BIOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE PLEISTOCENE FOSSILIFEROUS DEPOSITS OF THE 

SOUTHERN BRAZILIAN COASTAL AREA”, publicado no Journal of Mammalian 

Evolution n° 20, páginas 69 a 82, e “LATE MIDDLE TO LATE PLEISTOCENE 

PALEOECOLOGY AND PALEOENVIRONMENTS IN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF RIO 

GRANDE DO SUL STATE, SOUTHERN BRAZIL, FROM STABLE ISOTOPES IN 

FOSSILS OF TOXODON AND STEGOMASTODON” publicado na Palaeogeography, 

Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology n° 369, páginas 385 a 394. O primeiro apresenta questões 

relativas à posição estratigráfica e distribuição biogeográfica dos mamíferos pleistocênicos 

encontrados no Arroio Chuí, e possíveis correlações entre a composição da fauna e as 

variações climáticas. No segundo é apresentada uma reconstrução dos tipos de vegetação 

consumida e composição isotópica da água ingerida pelos mamíferos Toxodon e 

Stegomastodon (= Notiomastodon), a partir da qual foi inferido o tipo de ambiente em que 

esses animais viveram.  

Os dados preliminares relativos à estratigrafia foram apresentados no VIII Congresso 

da Associação Brasileira de Estudos do Quaternário (ABEQUA) e publicados no resumo 

expandido “GEOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EVOLUTION OF LAGOON 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       10 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
SYSTEM III IN THE SOUTHERNMOST COASTAL PLAIN OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL 

STATE”. Aqui são apresentadas informações referentes à evolução geológica dos depósitos 

situados acima da fácies marinha observada no arroio. A seqüência deposicional mostra 

paleossolos e sistemas fluviais na base, sobrepostos por uma camada de silte arenosos com 

nódulos carbonáticos, indicando clima progressivamente mais seco. 

Outras inferências paleo-ambientais feitas a partir de fósseis de mamíferos 

encontrados no Arroio Chuí, descritos nos artigos “CHINCHILLIDAE AND 

DOLICHOTINAE RODENTS (RODENTIA, HYSTRICOGNATHI, CAVIOMORPHA) 

FROM THE LATE PLEISTOCENE OF SOUTHERN BRAZIL” (Anexo 1) publicado em 

2011 na Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia, no. 14, volume 3, páginas 229 a 238 e “NEW 

REMAINS OF LATE PLEISTOCENE MAMMALS FROM THE CHUÍ CREEK, 

SOUTHERN BRAZIL” (Anexo 2), publicado em 2012 na Revista Brasileira de 

Paleontologia, no. 15, vol. 2, páginas 228 a 239. Os mamíferos que tem implicações paleo-

ambientais são Lagostomus cf. maximus, cf. Dolichotis (roedores) e Catagonus stenocephalus 

(porco selvagem), indicadores de ambientes semi-áridos; Myocastor coypus (ratão-do-

banhado, indicador de ambientes permanentemente úmidos); Eremotherium cf. laurillardi 

(preguiça gigante característica da região intertropical das Américas). O artigo do anexo 2 

ainda descreve fosseis de cervídeos do gênero Antifer, que se extinguiu na Região Pampeana 

da Argentina há aproximadamente 120 mil anos mas sobreviveu até o final do Pleistoceno no 

Rio Grande do Sul Uruguai e norte do Chile.     

 

6 – Metodologia 

 Os dados apresentados nesta tese foram coletados entre 2009 e 2011, através de 

trabalhos de campo no Arroio Chuí, feitos em parceria com o Museu Coronel Tancredo 

Fernandes de Mello, de Santa Vitória do Palmar. Foram feitas diversas saídas de um dia de 

duração, e mais duas saídas com permanência em acampamento de sete dias em 2010 e 2011, 

cobrindo aproximadamente 10 km da extensão do arroio. Os trabalhos de campo envolveram 

levantamentos estratigráficos para visualização da faciologia das barrancas, medições da 

espessura das camadas e coletas de fósseis e de sedimentos para análises sedimentológicas e 

datações. 

Cada perfil foi aberto, descrito e amostras de sedimento retiradas, bem como fósseis 

que eventualmente foram encontrados. As análises granulométricas e morfoscópicas foram 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       11 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
feitas no Laboratório de Geologia e Paleontologia da FURG; os fósseis encontrados foram 

tombados no museu.  

As análises isotópicas e datações por TL foram feitas em parceria com Ana Maria 

Ribeiro e Jorge Ferigolo, do Setor de Paleontologia do Museu de Ciências Naturais da 

Fundação Zoobotânica do Rio Grande do Sul. As amostras de esmalte dentário de mamíferos 

para análises isotópicas foram processadas no Núcleo de Estudos Geoquímicos – Laboratório 

de Isótopos Estáveis (NEG-LABISE) da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE). As 

datações por TL foram feitas na empresa Datação Comércio e Serviços, de São Paulo. 

As datações por ESR foram feitas em parceria com o laboratório de Física da USP de 

Ribeirão Preto e com o Instituto de Pesquisas Energéticas e Nucleares (IPEN) da USP de São 

Paulo. 

A identificação dos fósseis apresentados na tese foi feita por consultas a descrições 

publicadas e comparação com materiais de coleções osteológicas, com apoio de especialistas.  

 

7 - Conclusões 

• A estratigrafia, icnofósseis e fósseis de moluscos encontrados na fácies marinha 

exposta ao longo do Arroio Chuí indicam ambiente marinho raso, sob condições de 

elevada sedimentação. A ausência de variações faciológicas sugere agradação da 

costa, seguida de regressão marinha.  

 

• Datações por termoluminescência (TL) em sedimentos e ressonância do spin do 

elétron (ESR) nas conchas da fácies marinha indicam que a Barreira II teria sido 

formada durante o MIS 7, mais precisamente durante o sub-estágio 7e, há 

aproximadamente 220-240 mil anos. 

 

• O nivelamento altimétrico feito no arroio mostra que a amplitude máxima da 

transgressão que formou a Barreira II teria atingido aproximadamente 10 metros acima 

do atual, mas existe a possibilidade de essa amplitude ter sido influenciada por 

neotectônica posterior.  

 

• A presença na assembléia fossilífera de moluscos que atualmente vivem apenas em 

áreas mais quentes ao norte do Rio Grande do Sul, e as espécies de foraminíferos 

associadas, indicam condições oceanográficas mais quentes durante o Pleistoceno 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       12 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 

médio. Condições similares inferidas a partir de fósseis da última transgressão 

marinha sugerem que os máximos transgressivos podem ser caracterizados como 

hipsitérmicos.   

 

• A transição entre a fácies marinha e o ambiente terrestre é caracterizada pela presença 

de paleossolos e sistemas fluviais, estes provavelmente formados sob condições de 

elevada pluviosidade correlacionada a um período de baixa insolação (= baixa 

amplitude da precessão) há aproximadamente 220 mil anos atrás. Um sistema fluvial 

erosivo datado por TL em aproximadamente 173 mil anos também coincide com um 

período similar, reforçando que a precipitação no sul do Brasil é controlada 

basicamente pela precessão, como já inferido a partir de estudos em espeleotemas. 

 

• A assembléia fóssil encontrada no Arroio Chui abrange o período entre 226 e 34 mil 

anos atrás, como indicado pelas datações por ESR. A escassez de fósseis mais antigos 

que 50 mil anos pode resultar da destruição desses restos devido a retrabalhamento 

pós-deposicional, condicionados por episódios de reativação fluvial durante fases 

úmidas.    

 

• A presença na assembléia de mamíferos característicos da Fauna Pampeana 

(temperada) como Antifer e Doedicurus, e de táxons provenientes da Fauna Brasiliana 

(intertropical) como Eremotherium, indica migrações latitudinais das zonas climáticas. 

Durante fases mais frias (glaciais) a zona temperada teria migrado ate 750 km para 

norte, como inferido também a partir de registros polínicos no sudeste e sul do Brasil, 

enquanto durante fases quentes (interglaciais e interestadiais) a zona subtropical teria 

migrado para sul. 

 

• Os fósseis de Catagonus stenocephalus, Lagostomus cf. maximus e Dolichotis sp. 

indicam clima semi-árido, provavelmente correlacionado ao último máximo glacial 

(LGM), como indicado também pela deposição de grande quantidade de silte.  

 

• Análises de isótopos de carbono (13C) em dentes dos mamíferos Toxodon e 

Stegomastodon (= Notiomastodon) coletado no Arroio Chui indicam que a vegetação 

na época em que esses animais viveram era composta por gramíneas, arbustos e 

possivelmente matas de galeria, uma paisagem semelhante ao cerrado atual. 

  



                                                                                                                                                                                                       13 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
 

• Os valores de isótopos de oxigênio (18O) encontrados em Stegomastodon indicam que 

esses animais são bons indicadores da composição isotópica da água meteórica 

(proveniente da precipitação). Os valores mais altos observados em Toxodon sugerem 

que estes animais não teriam hábito semi-aquático similar ao dos hipopótamos, como 

originalmente proposto. 

 

• A sedimentologia indica que o clima regional se tornou semi-árido, como indicado 

pela elevada proporção de silte e presença de nódulos carbonáticos, que são formados 

sob condições de precipitação inferiores a 500 mm/ano. Esta fase seca teria ocorrido 

após aproximadamente 34 mil anos (inferido a partir das datações nos dentes de 

mamíferos), indicando correlação com o ultimo máximo glacial (LGM), ocorrido entre 

25 e 18 mil anos atrás, aproximadamente.   

 

• Os registros geológicos e paleontológicos apresentados e suas implicações 

paleoclimáticas mostram que as condições ambientais no sul do Brasil, tanto em terra 

quanto no oceano, têm sido controladas ao longo do Quaternário (ao menos entre o 

Pleistoceno tardio e Holoceno) pelas variações latitudinais das zonas climáticas, 

influenciadas pelos padrões orbitais (ciclos de Milankovitch), especialmente a 

Precessão e Obliqüidade. 

 

• Essas variações têm afetado diretamente a distribuição da fauna e flora no sul do 

Brasil (e provavelmente no norte do Uruguai, da Argentina e do Chile), 

proporcionando a dispersão para o norte de organismos pampeanos / patagônicos 

durante fases mais frias e a dispersão para o sul de organismos brasilianos durante 

fases mais quentes.

isotope stages (MIS) 11, 9, 7 and 1, but precise datings are lacking. Here is described a marine 63 

highstand older than 125 ka BP, based on the stratigraphy, ages and fossils of the marine facies of a 64 

coastal barrier. This facies is mostly covered by younger sediments, but is well-exposed along the 65 

banks of Chuí Creek. It is composed of fine, well-sorted quartz sand with ichnofossils Ophiomorpha 66 

nodosa and Rosselia sp., and shell concentrations. The sedimentary record indicates coastal 67 

aggradation, followed by sea-level fall and progradation of the coastline. Thermoluminescence (TL) 68 

and electron spin resonance (ESR) ages from sediments, shells and mammalian fossils point to an 69 

age of ~230 ka for the end of this marine transgression, thus correlating it to MIS 7 (substage 7e). 70 

Altimetric data point to a maximum amplitude of some 10 ± 1 meters above present-day mean sea-71 

level, but it is possible that neotectonics affected this record. Paleoclimatic conditions at the time of 72 

the highstand and correlations with other deposits in the Brazilian coasts are also discussed. 73

1. INTRODUCTION 77 

The Quaternary System encompasses the last 2.58 million years of Earth’s history, and has 78 

been characterized by glacial-interglacial cycles, represented mostly by the waxing and waning of 79 

ice sheets, most notably in the Northern Hemisphere (Pillans and Naish, 2004; Head et al., 2008; 80 

Gibbard et al., 2010). Besides affecting terrestrial environments due to changes in patterns of 81 

atmospheric circulation and moisture, latitudinal displacement of ecosystems and cooling, another 82 

important effect of these cycles has been the sea-level (eustatic) oscillations. Although regional 83 

isostasy, faulting and uplifting in coastal areas also play an important role in relative sea-level 84 

changes, the oscillations are directly linked to variations in the volume of the ice sheets, thus 85 

variations in the ratio of oxygen isotopes (16O/18O) in microfossils and gases recovered from deep-86 

sea and ice cores are used as proxies for changes in sea-levels, by assuming a relationship between 87 

these ratios and ice volumes.  88

Although recorded in coastal areas all around the globe since the XIX century (e.g. Darwin, 89 

1846), direct, reliable and well-preserved indicators of past sea level highstands older than the 90 

Pleistocene marine transgression of ~125 ka BP, correlated to marine isotope stage (MIS) 5, are 91 

relatively scarce throughout the globe. While oxygen isotope curves obtained from benthic 92 

foraminifera are used as indirect evidence of sea level oscillations through correlation with past ice 93 

volumes (Imbrie et al., 1984; Pisias et al., 1984, Martinson et al., 1987), direct records in coastal 94 

areas are represented by paleo-shorelines that contain datable geomorphological features such as 95 

raised terraces, wave-cut notches and aeolianites (Pirazzoli et al., 1991; Hearty and Kinder, 1995; 96 

Barreto et al., 2002) and other materials such as corals, vermetids or speleothems (Gallup et al., 97 

1994; Angulo et al., 2006).  98 

In the Brazilian coast, the Holocene highstand of ~6-5 ka BP (MIS 1) is well-represented by 99 

several records, despite of some discrepancies regarding its timing and amplitude (Martin et al., 100 

2003; Angulo et al., 2006). Good records of the transgression correlated to MIS 5 are found in some 101 

areas (Poupeau et al., 1988; Suguio et al., 2003, 2011; Tomazelli and Dillenburg, 2007) but the 102 

situation is complex for older transgressive events; so far only the northeastern Brazilian coast has 103 

provided features recognized as formed by the marine transgression during MIS 7 (Barreto et al., 104 

2002; Suguio et al., 2011). In the Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS), in southern 105 

Brazil, records of sea level oscillations prior to MIS 5 were reported from microfossils in drilling 106 

cores (Closs, 1970; Carreño et al., 1999) and geomorphological features (Poupeau et al., 1988; 107 

Villwock and Tomazelli, 1995; Tomazelli et al., 2000).  108 

The absolute chronologies and amplitudes of past sea-level oscillations in the coast of Rio 109 

Grande do Sul, however, are not well defined yet. This problem arises from the fact that most of the 110 

geomorphological units formed by sea-level highstands represent the aeolian facies of coastal 111 

barriers; these deposits are usually reworked by erosion, aeolian reactivation and/or vegetation 112 

growth. Besides, the CPRS is composed essentially of siliciclastic sediments, devoid of consolidated 113 

structures that could contain paleo sea-level indicators such as vermetids or erosion notches; thus, 114

most reliable sea-level indicators would be found in well-preserved deposits representing the marine 115 

facies of the barrier systems. However, the marine facies of the barrier systems are usually covered 116 

by younger sediments and coastal lakes. So far, the ~125 kyr-old Barrier System III is the only 117 

Pleistocene unit whose marine facies is well-preserved and exposed (Tomazelli and Dillenburg, 118 

2007).  119 

Here is presented a description of the marine facies of the Barrier System II, from outcrops 120 

found in the southern sector of the CPRS, with information regarding the amplitude and chronology 121 

of the marine highstand that was responsible for the origin of this depositional system. Correlations 122 

with other deposits and paleoclimatic inferences from fossils and sedimentary features are also 123 

presented. 124

2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 126 

The CPRS (Figure 1) is located in the southernmost portion of the Brazilian coast. This 127 

geomorphological unit is some 620 km-long and up to 100 km-wide, located between the latitudes 128 

29°18’31”S and 33°43’17”S, and it is the uppermost portion of the Pelotas Basin, the southernmost 129 

marginal basin of the Brazilian coast. This basin is composed of terrigenous siliciclastic sediments 130 

eroded from older geological units located landwards, accumulated in the coastal area since the split 131 

between South America and Africa in the Late Cretaceous; its maximum thickness is of some 132 

10,000 meters (Closs 1970; Bueno et al. 2007; Barboza et al. 2008). During the Quaternary, sea-133 

level oscillations correlated to glacial cycles reworked the uppermost sediments of the Pelotas 134 

Basin, as evidenced by facies changes and microfossil assemblages recovered from drilling holes 135 

(Closs 1970; Carreño et al. 1999). 136 

The first systematic geological survey of the CPRS was presented by Delaney (1965). That 137 

author followed the classical lithostratigraphy and proposed the name “Itapoã Formation” for the 138 

aeolian deposits found along the coastal plain, while the marine deposits were named “Chuí 139 

Formation”; these units were considered of Quaternary age because they overlie the Tertiary 140

“Graxaim Formation”. During the 1980s, new geological surveys led to a revision of the geology of 141 

the CPRS, and it became clear that the units grouped together as “Itapoã” and “Chuí” formations 142 

were in fact several distinct units deposited during different time intervals in response to distinct 143 

marine transgressions.  144 

The new surveys led to the replacement of the classic lithostratigraphic scheme of Delaney 145 

(1965) by the concept of depositional systems formed by chronocorrelated facies and facies 146 

associations (Tomazelli and Villwock, 2005). Following this scheme, the CPRS is divided in two 147 

major depositional systems: an Alluvial Fans System (the former “Graxaim Formation”) of 148 

Miocene-Pliocene age (Closs, 1970) and four barrier-lagoon depositional systems, each one 149 

correlated to a sea level highstand during a Quaternary interglacial epoch (Villwock and Tomazelli, 150 

1995). The Pleistocene marine highstands are recognized mostly by the aeolian facies of the barrier 151 

systems; deposits that represent the marine facies of these systems are usually covered by younger 152 

sediments. Precise indicators of paleo sea-level highstands are scarce in these coastal barriers; the 153 

only reliable records of Pleistocene sea levels known so far are ichnofossils Ophiomorpha nodosa 154 

preserved some 5 to 7 meters a.s.l. in shallow marine facies of the Barrier System III (Tomazelli and 155 

Dillenburg, 2007). 156 

The southernmost portion of CPRS is dominated by two Pleistocene (II and III) and one 157 

Holocene (IV) barrier-lagoon systems. Each system was chronologically correlated by Villwock and 158 

Tomazelli (1995) with the calibrated ?18O curves of Imbrie et al. (1984), thus attributing an age of 159 

~325 ka (MIS 9) for system II, ~125 ka (MIS 5) for system III and ~6 ka (MIS 1) for system IV. TL 160 

datings on sandstones exposed on the shoreline beneath the Holocene sediments of the Barrier IV 161 

System provided age of 109 ± 7.5 ky BP, reinforcing the proposed age for the Barrier System III 162 

(Buchmann and Tomazelli, 2003).  163

The Barrier System II is well-represented along the southern sector of the CPRS, stretching 166 

almost continuously for more than 200 km in the same SW-NE orientation of the coastline. The 167 

only important interruption is in the area of Taim, where a negative gravimetric anomaly suggests 168 

the existence of deformation features in the underlying bedrock, formed during the opening of the 169 

South Atlantic (Rosa et al., 2007; 2009). Only a small portion of this barrier is preserved in the 170 

northern area of the CPRS (Poupeau et al., 1988; Villwock and Tomazelli, 1995). 171 

The aeolian deposits of this system reach up to 25 meters above present sea-level and are 172 

composed of siliciclastic, well-sorted fine to medium quartz sand with feldspars, iron oxide crusts 173 

and nodules, diagenetic clays and small amounts of organic matter. The primary sedimentary 174 

structures have been obscured due to diagenetic processes, but the physical properties of the grains 175 

clearly indicate aeolian deposition (Villwock and Tomazelli, 1995). 176 

The low topographic area located landwards of the barrier is occupied by a large water body 177 

(Mirim Lake). The barrier gently dips seawards, where it is covered by younger sediments of the 178 

Barrier-Lagoon System III. The only area known so far where the marine facies of the barrier 179 

outcrops is along the Chuí Creek, near the town of Santa Vitória do Palmar (Figure 2a). This fluvial 180 

system flows in a NE-SW direction until the town of Chuí, where it turns SE following the Chuí 181 

faulting zone. The creek was a shallow water course that was further deepened in the early 1960s to 182 

drain the surrounding wetlands and provide area for agriculture.  183 

 184 

3.1. Stratigraphy of the Marine Facies 185 

 The deepening of the creek exposed marine sediments at the base of the banks; these are 186 

overlaid by a terrestrial sequence formed by paleosoils, aeolian and fluviolacustrine facies that 187 

contain remains of Pleistocene mammals (Figure 2b, c; Lopes et al., 2009). The first stratigraphic 188 

description of the deposits exposed along Chuí Creek was presented by Soliani (1973), who 189 

correlated the marine sediments to the “Chuí Formation” of Delaney (1965) and assigned the 190 

overlying fossil-bearing strata to a new unit which he called “Santa Vitória Formation”.  191

Under the new concept adopted since the 1980s, the marine sediments exposed along the 192 

creek are recognized as the marine facies of the Barrier II. These sediments constitute the uppermost 193 

portion of the highstand systems tract of the Barrier System II (HST2), while the overlying 194 

sediments are part of the Lagoon System III, represented by fluvial and aeolian facies and 195 

paleosoils, according to the stratigraphic scheme proposed by Rosa (2012). 196 

Some 2 meters of this facies outcrop above the creek bed; drillings with hand auger indicate 197 

that it is more than 10 meters in thickness. At least three types of contact between the marine facies 198 

and the overlying terrestrial sediments have been identified (Figure 3). One is characterized by 199 

paleosoils developed directly on top of the marine facies, with root traces, mud-filled root cavities 200 

and usually mottled by iron oxide (Figure 3a); sometimes aeolian deposits are also found on this 201 

interval (see Figure 3c). Other type is fluvial-concordant (Type I, Figure 3b), characterized by 202 

massive sand layers containing mud intraclasts and mammalian remains; the absence of erosive 203 

surfaces indicates a gradual transition from marine to fluvial facies. This type of fluvial system was 204 

probably established when regional base level was still high, before sea-level had fully retreated 205 

after the marine highstand. The third type of contact is fluvial erosive (Type II, Figure 3c), found 206 

along the banks as 30 to 40 cm-thick dark brown sand lenses that erode into the underlying marine 207 

sediments, contain vertebrate fossils and mud intraclasts, and are interpreted as oxbow lakes (Lopes 208 

et al., 2009). At least five of these lenses have been observed so far along the banks, and the erosive 209 

contact with the underlying marine sediments indicate that this type of fluvial system was formed at 210 

a time when the regional base level was lowered, i.e., when sea-level had fully retreated. One dating 211 

by thermoluminescence (see below) reinforces this interpretation. 212 

The marine facies is composed of fine, well-sorted siliciclastic sand with some amounts of 213 

biogenic carbonate, heavy minerals, muscovite and some minerals of terrigenous origin. Primary 214 

sedimentary structures are well-represented by cross and parallel stratifications (Figure 3b, c). The 215 

presence of several erosion surfaces, ichnofossils and some shell concentrations (see below) suggest 216 

the occurrence of storm events. The sedimentary structures and ichnofossil content indicate that this 217

facies was deposited under similar conditions (upper shoreface-foreshore) of the Facies B described 218 

from the Barrier System III (Tomazelli and Dillenburg, 2007). 219 

The ~2 meter-thick marine layer exposed along the banks of the creek clearly indicates a 220 

sea-level rise, but from the base to the top portion of the layer there are no visible faciological 221 

changes. In a shallow slope coast such as the one of Rio Grande do Sul (between 0.03° and 0.08°; 222 

Dillenburg et al., 2009), a sea-level rise would result in increased depth and lateral migration of 223 

facies, thus lower shoreface (finer) sediments would be deposited on top of upper coarser sediments 224 

of the shoreface. The absence of fine sediments in the marine facies and the persistence of shallow 225 

marine conditions throughout the exposed portion of the sequence, however, show that there were 226 

no faciological changes despite of the sea-level rise. This suggests that sea-level rise was 227 

accompanied by high sedimentation rates, which resulted in aggradation of the coastline, followed 228 

by sea-level fall and progradation. 229 

 230 

3.2. Fossil content 231 

Until recently, only ichnofossils have been found in the marine facies (Lopes et al., 2001). 232 

The most conspicuous ichnofossil is Ophiomorpha nodosa, consisting of pellet-lined vertical shafts 233 

and horizontal galleries (Figure 3d), produced by thalassinidean crustaceans. This ichnofossil is 234 

regarded as an indicator of shallow marine conditions (Frey et al., 1978; Pollard et al., 1993), and is 235 

also common in the marine facies of the Barrier System III (de Gibert et al., 2006; Tomazelli and 236 

Dillenburg, 2007). 237 

 Other type of ichnofossil is Rosselia sp. (Figure 3e), produced by terebellid polychaetes in 238 

shallow marine settings (Nara, 2002). These traces are conical-shaped vertical galleries, usually 239 

nested within each other. This ichnofossil is usually spindle-shaped, but the conical shapes of those 240 

found in Chuí Creek indicate truncation by storm events. Both Ophiomorpha and Rosselia are found 241 

from the lower to the upper level of the marine facies. Other smaller galleries have not been 242 

identified, and have been probably produced by other small invertebrates (Figure 3c). 243

The only body fossils found so far in the marine facies consist of molluscan shells, ostracod 244 

carapaces and foraminiferal tests, forming at least four densely-packed concentrations (Lopes and 245 

Simone, 2012). These concentrations consist of marine, mostly shallow-living infaunal bivalves, 246 

and include complete, well-preserved specimens and small, rounded and unidentifiable fragments. 247 

Because the four concentrations outcrop at the same stratigraphic position, contain essentially the 248 

same taxa and exhibit the same pattern of preservation, it is assumed that they represent a single 249 

isochronous taphocoenosis (Lopes and Simone, 2012). The association between complete shells, 250 

including articulated bivalves and ostracodes, and smaller, much abraded fragments, seems to 251 

indicate that a storm event was responsible for the deposition of this assemblage. Vertical shafts of 252 

O. nodosa have been observed crossing one of the shell concentrations. 253 

The ostracods have not been described yet, but the foraminifera include mostly Ammonia 254 

beccari forma tepida, Buccella peruviana and Elphidium discoidale, besides few individuals of 255 

other genera (Lopes and Bonetti, unpublished data).  256 

 257 

3.3. Timing and amplitude of the marine highstand 258 

As an attempt to establish a more precise chronology for this marine highstand, fossil shells 259 

and mammalian remains were subject to dating by electron spin resonance (ESR), and sediments 260 

extracted from the marine and overlying terrestrial beds exposed along the creek were dated using 261 

thermoluminescence (TL). The only absolute ages obtained so far for the Pleistocene deposits of the 262 

CPRS are from the Barrier System III (Poupeau et al., 1988; Buchmann and Tomazelli, 2003). 263 

The first ESR ages for mammalian fossils from Chuí Creek provided ages of 226 ± 35, 42 ± 264 

3, 38 ± 2 and 34 ± 7 thousand years (Lopes et al., 2010). The ~226 kyr-old sample was collected at 265 

the lowermost portion of the fossil-bearing layer, just above the marine sediments, and its age, much 266 

older than previously estimated (e.g. Lopes et al., 2009) raised the question of whether the marine 267 

facies below could represent a transgression younger than MIS 9 (about 325 kyr BP), which was 268 

originally proposed by Villwock and Tomazelli (1995).  269

As an attempt to test this assumption and refine the regional chronostratigraphy, four 270 

sediment samples were collected for age determination using TL dating. One sample was collected 271 

from the shallow marine facies, about 1 meter below the marine-continental transition (Figure 4a), 272 

and one other was extracted from fossil-bearing aeolian sediments located ~1 meter above, at the 273 

basis of the continental sequence (Figure 4b). The two other samples were also collected from the 274 

continental unit, but in different points along the banks. One was extracted from a fossiliferous dark 275 

sand lens which represents one fluvial-erosive facies (Figure 4c), and the other was collected from 276 

paleosoils positioned some 0.5 m above the top of the marine facies (Figure 4d). 277 

The TL ages were determined at Datação Comércio e Prestação de Serviços Ltda. (São 278 

Paulo, Brazil) using the multiple aliquote regeneration (MAR) protocol. The sediments from the 279 

shallow marine facies provided an age of 235.5 ± 23.5 kyr BP, and the sediments collected near the 280 

mammalian fossils were dated on 214 ± 21 kyr BP. The sample from the fluvial sand lens was dated 281 

on 173 ± 22 kyr BP, while the sample from the paleosoil was dated on 132 ± 18 ky BP, respectively 282 

(Figure 4).  283 

In addition to the TL datings, fifteen molluscan shells, plus other six mammalian teeth from 284 

the fluvial facies were also selected for dating using ESR. The shells were collected from three of 285 

the concentrations at the lower portion of the marine facies, and a mean age of 224 ± 24.6 ka was 286 

obtained (Lopes et al., unpublished data). This age is younger than the ‘real’ age due to the high 287 

Uranium concentrations observed in several specimens; considering that ~224 ka should be 288 

considered the minimum age of these shells, an estimated age closer to ~235-240 kyr BP, within the 289 

error margin, would be consistent with the TL ages obtained from the overlying sediments. This 290 

estimate is consistent with the oceanographic conditions indicated by the taxonomic composition of 291 

the molluscan assemblage (see below). The mammalian teeth provided ages between 80±10 kyr and 292 

42±3 kyr, consistent with the previous ESR datings (Lopes et al., 2010).  293 

The altimetric data were obtained with Total Station, using as reference a nearby geodetic 294 

reference level (RN1968U, 33°36’03”S / 053°19’54”W), complemented by digital elevation models 295

of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results show that the contact between the 296 

marine and continental sequences observed along the creek (see Figure 2) is positioned some 9.5 297 

meters above mean sea-level (a.s.l.). Subsurface features detected with ground-penetrating radar 298 

(GPR) surveys between the Barrier Systems II and III show that the height of this contact varies 299 

between ~12 and 8,5 meters a.s.l. (Rosa, 2012), thus, a mean amplitude of some 10 ± 1 meters a.s.l 300 

for this record of the marine highstand seems reasonable.  301 

 302 

4. DISCUSSION 303 

 304 

4.1. Amplitude of the transgression 305 

The marine facies of the Barrier System II described here is the first paleo sea-level indicator 306 

older than MIS 5 with good stratigraphic control and associated datings found in the CPRS. The 307 

obtained data improve the estimates for the late Pleistocene-early Holocene sea-level curve for 308 

southern Brazil (Figure 5). The estimated amplitude is of some 7±1 m a.s.l for the MIS 5 highstand 309 

(Tomazelli and Dillenburg, 2007), and of 4±1 m for the Holocene highstand (Martin et al., 2003; 310 

Angulo et al., 2006; Caron, 2007).  Although Villwock and Tomazelli (1995) estimated amplitudes 311 

between 18 and 24 meters a.s.l for this transgression, based on terraces cut along the western margin 312 

of Mirim Lake and Patos Lagoon, the sedimentary record suggests a lower amplitude; thus it is 313 

possible that those terraces represent an older marine transgression. 314 

A comparison among paleo sea-level records found around the globe show that estimates of 315 

the amplitude of highstands during MIS 7 are highly variable (Table 1), but are below the values 316 

found for the Barrier System II. While some data indicate that the sea level during that interval did 317 

not reach amplitudes comparable to present mean sea-level (Dutton et al., 2009; Bard et al., 2002; 318 

Schellmann and Radtke, 2004), other records indicate sea levels equal or higher than the present one 319 

(Bezerra et al., 1998; Vesica et al., 2000). This variability is likely to be caused by different dating 320 

methods employed (U/Th series, ESR), by differences among dated materials (corals, vermetids, 321

shells, sediments) and by the tectonic history of each site, as is the case for Holocene deposits in 322 

northeastern Brazil (Barreto et al., 2002; Suguio et al., 2011). Moreover, it shows that it is not 323 

possible to establish a single global sea-level curve for any specific time interval based solely on 324 

stratigraphic records.  325 

The 16O/18O ratio (?18O) obtained from tests of benthic foraminifera have been used as a 326 

proxy for global sea-levels because the isotopic composition of ocean water is considered to be 327 

covariant with ice volumes (Shackleton, 1967; Shackleton and Opdyke, 1973; Imbrie et al., 1984; 328 

Martinson et al., 1987). This relationship, however, is not straightforward, because the isotopic 329 

composition of the tests is also affected by ocean water temperature, salinity and isotopic 330 

composition (Goy et al., 2006; Siddal et al., 2007). The isotopic composition of the ice caps may 331 

vary due to regional fluctuations of isotopically heterogeneous glaciers or to increase in size and 332 

elevation of the ice sheets; the ?18O signal of these ice masses is transferred to seawater when they 333 

melt at the end of glacial phases or when they collapse due to instability (Mix and Ruddiman, 1984; 334 

Berger, 2008). This implies that the collapse of an ice sheet with high ?18O values during an 335 

interglacial may result in several meters of marine transgression and still produce an isotopic signal 336 

similar to that observed during glacial times (and lower sea-levels). This could explain (at least in 337 

part) the apparent discrepancies between sea-levels estimated from isotopic values and those 338 

inferred from stratigraphic records. 339 

Nevertheless, the oxygen isotope curves are regarded as reliable indicators of the timing of 340 

marine highstands/lowstands. The available curves show that MIS 7 is characterized by three 341 

substages, 7e, 7c and 7a, from older to younger (Imbrie et al., 1984), each one marked by an 342 

isotopic event peak (7.5, 7.3 and 7.1, respectively). The curves show the highest peaks usually occur 343 

at the beginning of the interglacials (Figure 6), and are followed by progressive fall punctuated by 344 

minor oscillations (Hodell et al., 2000). Although sea-level variations seem to mirror this pattern, 345 

the amplitude of the highstands are influenced not only by variations in ice volume, but probably 346 

also by the isostatic response of the shelf to increasing water load, and will be a function of mantle 347

rheology, the amount and rate of meltwater discharged into the oceans and of the coastline geometry 348 

(Lambeck et al., 2012).  349 

The eastern South America coastline is a passive margin, characterized by trailing-edge 350 

coasts, thus considered stable in terms of large-scale tectonics. Nevertheless, there are evidences of 351 

tectonic processes related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean during the Tertiary and possibly 352 

during the Quaternary. The most conspicuous evidences of neotectonics are found in the 353 

southeastern and northeastern portions of the Brazilian coast (Suguio and Martin, 1996; Bezerra et 354 

al., 1998; 2003; Barreto et al., 2002), where deposits correlated to MIS 7c and positioned between 355 

1.3 and 7.5 meters a.s.l (lower than the 11 to 20 meters a.s.l. terraces of MIS 5) are considered to 356 

represent downfaulted blocks. Although Delaney (1962) proposed that the coastal barriers of Rio 357 

Grande do Sul state have been formed by vertical tectonic movements, the southern Brazilian coast 358 

has been regarded as tectonically stable, which favored the development of the large barrier-lagoon 359 

systems in response to the Quaternary sea-level oscillations (Villwock and Tomazelli, 1995).  360 

Fonseca (2005) reported some deformations and microfaultings in deposits of the Barrier 361 

System II in the northern sector of the CPRS, and regarded these features as evidence of 362 

neotectonics. Such features, however, have not been observed so far in Barrier System II deposits in 363 

the southern portion of the coastal plain. 364 

Despite of the apparent absence of features indicative of neotectonic processes on the 365 

surface, some features on the underlying bedrock have the potential to influence the coastal 366 

tectonics. The most important tectonic feature in the CPRS is the Pelotas Fault that runs in a NE-SW 367 

direction beneath Patos Lagoon and Mirim Lake (see Figure 1). In the area of Mirim Lake, the fault 368 

is considered normal with a vertical component to SE, but there are no reliable data regarding this 369 

(Saadi et al., 2002). Other subsurface features in the southern CPRS include the E-W negative 370 

gravimetric anomaly at Taim and the positive E-W to NW-SE Mirim Lake Anomaly (Rosa, 2009). 371 

The Taim Anomaly is related to sediment-filled fault system, while the Mirim Lake Anomaly is 372 

related to fractures filled by Mesozoic magmatic rocks. If these fractures have been reactivated 373

during Quaternary times, then it seems possible that the southern sector of the CPRS has been 374 

uplifted along the Pelotas Fault, which could explain the relative absence of deposits correlated to 375 

the Barrier System II in the central and northern sectors of the plain.  376 

Besides local tectonics, another possible explanation for the uplifting involves large-scale 377 

processes affecting the South American plate. The westwards movement of the plate would result in 378 

crustal thickening and vertical thrusting and uplifting along the eastern coast of South America due 379 

to horizontal compression (Pedoja et al., 2011). Those authors also observed that uplift rates 380 

estimated from deposits correlated to MIS 5 decrease from south to north, which could be related to 381 

differences in elastic thickness between the Patagonian Massif and the Brazilian Shield. By 382 

assuming an altitude of 6 to 8 m a.s.l. for the highstand of MIS 5e in Rio Grande do Sul (Tomazelli 383 

and Dillenburg, 2007) an estimated uplift rate of 0.06 mm/yr is obtained; if this value is extrapolated 384 

for MIS 7 (considering an age of ~230 ka for the maximum highstand, see below) it would result in 385 

an amplitude of ~13-14 meters a.s.l., higher than the observed record. This implies that if the 386 

southern Brazilian coast has been subject to uplifting since the middle-late Pleistocene, the uplifting 387 

rates have varied through time.  388 

Most paleo sea-level records indicate that the amplitude of the MIS 5 highstand was close to 389 

that of MIS 7. Along the Argentinean coast of Patagonia, for example, the absence of features 390 

correlated to MIS 7 indicates that the MIS 5 highstand reached amplitudes equal or higher than the 391 

former (Rostami et al., 2000). If in the CPRS the amplitudes of both highstands were similar, then 392 

the estimated difference of 1 to 5 meters between the MIS 5 (7±1m a.s.l) and MIS 7 (10±1m a.s.l) 393 

highstands could indicate that the Barrier System II in the southern sector of the CPRS was uplifted 394 

to altitudes higher than those reached by the following highstand of 125 ka BP. This could also 395 

explain the absence in the continental sequence exposed along the banks of Chuí Creek of lacustrine 396 

facies of the Lagoon System III, which are likely to be preserved only closer to the Barrier III, as 397 

shown in Figure 2b, and possibly explain the relative absence of the Barrier System II in the central 398 

and northern sectors of the coastal plain.  399

4.2. Chronology of the transgression 401 

Both TL and ESR ages presented here indicate that the Barrier System II was formed by the 402 

marine transgression correlated to MIS 7. Despite of the apparent discrepancy between the shells 403 

(mean age = ~224 ka) and the overlying marine sediments (~235 ka), it should be taken in account 404 

that the shells exhibit younger ages due to excessive Uranium uptake (Lopes et al., 2012), thus their 405 

‘real’ ages are probably closer to 235-240 ka. An age of ~238 ka BP would be consistent with 406 

warmer sea waters (see below) recorded for the isotopic event 7.5 (Figure 6), and also with most 407 

accepted ages for the MIS 7e marine highstand, from 237 to 228 ka BP (Robinson et al., 2002; Goy 408 

et al., 2006; Dutton et al., 2009). 409 

 The lowest ?18O values during MIS 7 for the Atlantic (Figure 6) and Pacific oceans 410 

(Lisiecki and Raymo, 2009), derived from several deep-sea cores, is the isotopic event 7.5; some 411 

paleo sea-level records (Table 1) also indicate that the highest amplitude of sea-level was reached 412 

around this time (Lea et al., 2002). Other records, however, correlate the highest peak to the event 413 

7.3 (MIS 7c, Barreto et al., 2002; Walbroeck et al., 2002; Suguio et al., 2011) or to the event 7.1 414 

(MIS 7a, Gallup et al., 1994; Hearty and Kindler, 1995; Goy et al., 2006).  415 

The ESR age of ~226 ka BP from a tooth of the extinct mammal Toxodon collected from a 416 

Type 1 fluvial facies at the transition between the marine and terrestrial sequences exposed along 417 

Chuí Creek (Lopes et al., 2010) suggests that sea-level was already falling around this time, which 418 

would be consistent with the end of MIS 7e, around 228 ka BP (Robinson et al., 2002). The absence 419 

of erosional featureas indicative of fluvial incision, however, which would be expected if regional 420 

base level was lower than the fluvial system (Catuneanu, 2006), indicate that sea-level was still 421 

relatively high around 226 ka BP. The TL age obtained from the fossil-bearing aeolian sediments 422 

above the marine-terrestrial transition indicates that sea-level had fully retreated around ~214 ka BP, 423 

and the ~207 ka ESR age of a mammalian tooth from the continental shelf (Lopes et al., 2010) 424 

shows that sea-level was already below present level at this time. The TL age of ~173 ka BP from 425

the dark sand lens, interpreted as a meandering fluvial system that incised the underlying marine 426 

facies due to lowered regional base level, is also consistent with an interval of lower sea-level. 427 

Substages 7e and 7c are separated by an interval marked by a sharp increase in  the return to 428 

almost full glacial conditions (isotopic event 7.4), indicated by increase in ?18O values and decrease 429 

in temperatures (Hodell et al., 2000; Lang and Wolff, 2011; Figure 6) which are likely to represent 430 

ice expansion and thus sea-level fall. The absence of marine sediments in the upper levels of the 431 

banks of Chuí Creek indicate that sea-level did not reach similar amplitude during MIS 7c or 7a, 432 

despite of the return to interglacial conditions during these substages. 433 

 434 

4.3. Paleoclimatic inferences 435 

MIS 7 is marked by three oxygen isotope peaks, with the highest and oldest (7e) generally 436 

considered to be characterized by fully interglacial conditions, while the following substages (7c 437 

and 7a), although weaker, are also considered full interglacials according to some records (Lang and 438 

Wolff, 2011). The transition from MIS 8 to MIS 7 (Termination III) occurred around 250 ka BP, 439 

and full interglacial conditions were reached around 237 ka BP (Robinson et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 440 

2009). 441 

Some of the fossil mollusks found within the marine facies point to paleoclimatic conditions 442 

different than the present ones in the CPRS. The presence of four bivalve taxa (Anomalocardia 443 

brasiliana, Arcinella brasiliana, Chione cancellata and Chione paphia) that today inhabit only 444 

warmer waters in areas to the north of Rio Grande do Sul state, at about 28°S (Lopes et al., 2012b 445 

indicate warmer conditions. Anomalocardia and other ‘Brazilian’ (warm water) taxa have also been 446 

recorded in Pleistocene and Holocene deposits of Uruguay and Argentina (up to 38°S), and this 447 

have been regarded as caused by stronger southwards influence of the Brazil Current (BC) 448 

(Martínez et al., 2006; Aguirre et al., 2011).  449 

The oceanographic conditions in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (up to ~41°S) today are 450 

under the direct influence of the warm BC, which constitutes the southern branch of the warm South 451

Equatorial Current, and the cold Malvinas Current (MC) which branches from the Antarctic 452 

Circumpolar Current (ACC) and has been reaching southern Brazil since the Pliocene (Coimbra et 453 

al., 2009); the confluence between both currents forms the Subtropical Front (STF). The southwards 454 

influence of the BC and associated water masses is controlled mostly by two seasonal processes: 455 

one is the shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) to the south of the equator during 456 

austral summer (Emílsson, 1960; Johns et al., 1998); the other is the intensification of the ACC (and 457 

consequently northwards displacement of the MC) during austral winter (Matano et al., 1993; 458 

Wainer et al., 2000).  459 

It is likely that in geological timescales precession-driven cyclic variations of Southern 460 

Hemisphere insolation also control the latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ, and consequently of 461 

the range and intensity of the BC. Conditions of stronger southwards influence of the BC in the Late 462 

Pleistocene and Holocene are correlated to the insolation-driven shift of the ITCZ (Toledo et al., 463 

2008). The interval between 235 and 225 ka BP was marked by higher Southern Hemisphere 464 

insolation (Figure 6), thus it seems probable that the BC was also stronger during this time.  465 

On the other hand, temperature changes in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean could 466 

have also contributed for general warmer oceanographic conditions in southern Brazil. Warmer than 467 

present temperatures (hypsithermals) are generally observed during the early phases of interglacial 468 

stages and are followed by cooling (neoglacial) phases (Emiliani, 1972; Hodell et al., 2000). 469 

Hypsithermal conditions in the Southern Ocean, with summer sea surface temperatures (SSSTs, 470 

Figure 6) 1–5°C warmer than today, happened during the isotopic events 7.5, 7.1, 5.5, and the early 471 

Holocene, as indicated by paleotemperature reconstructions from planktonic foraminifera and the 472 

absence of ice-rafted debris (Becquey and Gersonde, 2002, 2003). Warmer atmospheric 473 

temperatures in Antarctica at these intervals are also inferred from Deuterium and CO2 474 

concentrations found in Vostok ice cores (Petit et al., 1999, Figure 6) and are likely to have 475 

contributed for this hypsithermal (Cheng et al., 2009). Low obliquity (Figure 6) may have also 476

contributed for warmer temperatures in Antarctica around ~235 ka BP, because such condition 477 

results in less seasonal temperature variations. 478 

The ~2°C warming recorded during MIS 7.5 in the Southern Ocean was marked by a 479 

polewards migration of the STF, also indicated by reduction in ice-rafted debris from deep sea cores 480 

(Becquey and Gersonde, 2002; 2003; Kanfoush et al., 2002). The reduction in sea ice cover around 481 

Antarctica during the Holocene hypsithermal (~10 to 5 ka BP) indicates that circumpolar water 482 

fronts and air masses have retreated polewards at this time (Domack et al., 2001; Hodell et al., 483 

2001; Lamy et al., 2002), which probably occurred also during past hypsithermals. This retreatment 484 

would weaken the ACC, and consequently reduce the equatorwards influence of the MC, thus 485 

allowing the BC to reach farther south than during colder intervals. The association of weakened 486 

MC, insolation-enhanced BC, low obliquity and warmer Southern Ocean during MIS 7.5 could have 487 

been responsible for the shift of the ‘Brazilian’ molluscan fauna to higher latitudes than their 488 

present-day distribution. Thus, not only the datings but also the paleoclimatic inferences from the 489 

molluscan taxa indicate that the Barrier System II was formed by a transgression during an 490 

hypsithermal at the beginning of the interglacial epoch.  491 

Besides the Barrier II, warm water marine mollusks have also been recorded in deposits 492 

correlated to the Holocene highstand of ~5-6 ka BP and located some 3 meters a.s.l. (Caron, 2007). 493 

This interval has also been considered as an hypsithermal, based on the presence of Holocene beach 494 

rocks in the Brazilian and Argentinean coasts and large accumulations of molluscan remains found 495 

in the Todos os Santos Bay and Araruama Lagoon in northeastern and southeastern Brazil, 496 

respectively, and interpreted as representing episodes of increased biological productivity (Suguio, 497 

2001). The presence of vermetids found some 2 meters a.s.l. and dated as of ~5.4 ka BP in Laguna 498 

and Imbituba (~28°S) also point to warmer conditions, because these organisms do not live to the 499 

south of 22°S today (Angulo et al., 1999). Although paleoclimatic indicators have not yet been 500 

found in deposits correlated to MIS 5 (~125 ka BP), it seems that the highstands recorded in the 501 

Brazilian coast have been marked by warmer oceanographic conditions. 502

The marine-terrestrial transition represented in the sedimentary record exposed along the 503 

banks was gradual, represented either by aeolian sediments/paleosoils right on top of the marine 504 

sediments, or by the Type 1 fluvial facies. The presence of fluvial systems at the transition could be 505 

related to paleoclimatic conditions, i.e, high precipitation regimes that would result in increased 506 

fluvial discharge and sedimentary input. Precipitation in southern Brazil is basically controlled by 507 

two seasonal processes: the South America summer monsoon (SASM), that brings tropical moisture 508 

from Amazonia through a low-level jet (LLJ), and the winter precipitation of extratropical origin, 509 

controlled by the northwards displacement and enhancement of the polar fronts. The amount of 510 

precipitation is higher during winter than during summer, and the same pattern also operates in 511 

orbital timescales, because the interplay between tropical/extratropical precipitation is controlled by 512 

the precessional 23-ka cyclic oscillations in insolation, with increased precipitation during periods 513 

of low Southern Hemisphere summer insolation, due to higher northwards influence of the polar 514 

fronts. Conversely, intervals of high summer insolation, when precipitation is mostly of tropical 515 

origin, tend to be less humid in southern Brazil (Cruz et al., 2005; 2009).  516 

After the Barrier II was formed, all fluvial discharge from the continent became trapped by 517 

the Mirim Lake, and would not reach the shoreline (see Figure 1). Considering that the area of Chuí 518 

Creek is located seawards of the barrier, the only discharges that could contribute to coastal 519 

sedimentation during the marine highstand would have been small washouts and streams of pluvial 520 

origin formed on this side of the barrier. Today, this mechanism is the only source of sediment 521 

transport from the backbarrier to the shoreface in most of the coast of Rio Grande do Sul state, and 522 

is more expressive during winter because of the higher amount of precipitation during this season 523 

(Figueiredo and Calliari, 2005; Figueiredo et al., 2007). Considering that in orbital timescales the 524 

precipitation in southern Brazil is driven by precessional variations of insolation (Cruz et al., 2005; 525 

2009), it is likely that periods of lower insolation in the past have been marked by increased amount 526 

and volume of washouts and consequently of higher terrigenous sedimentary input to the shoreline. 527

The mud intraclasts found in the Type 1 fluvial facies (Figure 3) probably represent terrigenous 528 

sediments, given that no mud have been found in the marine facies. 529 

The insolation values for southern Brazil were much lower than today around 215-227 ka 530 

BP, due to a combination of low precessional and high eccentricity values, plus high obliquity 531 

(Figure 6), thus resulting in increased seasonal (mostly during winter) precipitation. The Type 1 532 

(concordant) fluvial facies represented in the sedimentary record exposed along Chuí Creek at the 533 

marine-terrestrial transition seems consistent with high sediment input, possibly representing 534 

material eroded from the nearby aeolian facies of the barrier by increased pluviosity and discharged 535 

into the shoreline through washouts. For comparison, conditions of low insolation, high eccentricity 536 

and probably high precipitation rates are also observed around 173 ka BP (Figure 6), thus consistent 537 

with increased fluvial activity represented by the Type 2 (erosive) fluvial facies dated by TL. 538 

 539 

4.4. Correlations 540 

Along the Brazilian coast the Holocene transgression, also called Santos (or Last) 541 

Transgression is well-represented by several deposits with good altimetric control and absolute ages 542 

which show that the maximum amplitude of some 4±1 meters a.s.l. was reached between 6 and 5 ka 543 

BP (Suguio et al., 1985; Angulo et al., 1999; 2006; Martin et al., 2003, Caron, 2007; Dillenburg et 544 

al., 2009). There are relatively few Pleistocene units with well-established chronostratigraphic 545 

setting; most of the data are from deposits correlated to the ~125 ka BP transgression, also called 546 

Cananeia or Penultimate Transgression. In southeastern Brazil (São Paulo state) the Cananeia 547 

Formation is well-constrained by several absolute TL ages (Suguio et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 548 

2003). In northeastern Brazil (Bahia state), Martin et al. (1982) identified this transgressive event on 549 

the basis of Io/U datings on corals. The Touros Formation that outcrops along the coast of Rio 550 

Grande do Norte state, provided luminescence ages of 117-110 thousand years (Barreto et al., 551 

2002), consistent with the ~110 ka BP age obtained for the Barrier System III (Buchmann and 552 

Tomazelli, 2003). Other marine terraces found along the coasts of Bahia, Sergipe and Alagoas states 553

were tentatively correlated to this transgressive event (Bittencourt et al., 1979; 1983), but without 554 

absolute ages. 555 

Besides the Barrier System II in Rio Grande do Sul, the only other units recognized as 556 

representing the MIS 7 transgressive event on the basis of absolute ages are the aforementioned 557 

deposits from northeastern Brazil dated by Barreto et al. (2002) and Suguio et al (2011) that belong 558 

to the Barra de Tabatinga Formation, and provided TL and OSL ages between 215 and 220 ka (MIS 559 

7c). The discrepancy in ages between the transgressive deposits of MIS 7 found in Rio Grande do 560 

Norte and Rio Grande do Sul could be explained by analytical factors (resolution, calibration, etc) 561 

or by the distinct depositional histories between these sites, but could also represent a delayed 562 

eustatic signal in the northeastern area, due to its greater distance from the nearest ice sheet 563 

(Antarctica) and hence from the deformational bulge produced in the crust by this sheet, as proposed 564 

by Lambeck et al. (2012).  565 

The presence of MIS 7 highstands in southern and northeastern Brazil (distant some 4.000 566 

km from each other) indicate that other deposits correlated to this marine highstand are likely to be 567 

found in other areas along the coast. Several marine terraces found along the coasts of Sergipe, 568 

Bahia, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina states, considered as evidences of the “Older 569 

Transgression”, could possibly  indicate the MIS 7 highstand, but lack absolute datings for any 570 

conclusive correlation (Figure 7). 571 

 572 

5. CONCLUSIONS 573 

The portion of the marine sequence exposed along Chuí Creek represents the uppermost 574 

portion of the highstand systems tract of the Barrier System II, and constitute the first good direct 575 

evidence of a maximum sea-level highstand older than MIS 5 recorded in southern Brazil. The TL 576 

and ESR ages, and the stratigraphic sequence along Chuí Creek indicate that this sea level highstand 577 

is correlated to MIS 7, reached some 10 meters a.s.l. around ~230 ka BP and was retreating around 578 

~226 ka BP. Although the timing of the highstand is consistent with other records of MIS 7e, the 579

amplitude is much larger than most records; despite the fact that the southern Brazilian coast is 580 

considered tectonically stable, this could indicate the influence of local neotectonics or tectonic 581 

processes operating on continental scales. Variations in altitudes between Pleistocene and Holocene 582 

deposits along the southeastern and northeastern portions of the Brazilian coast are related to 583 

neotectonic processes, but further research is needed in order to evaluate whether the amplitude of 584 

the MIS 7 highstand in southern Brazil was influenced by such processes. 585 

The presence within the marine facies of bivalve species that today live only to the north of 586 

Rio Grande do Sul state suggests warmer oceanographic conditions in the past, possibly related to 587 

orbitally-driven increased southwards influence of the Brazil Current and/or warming of the Atlantic 588 

sector of Southern Ocean during the hypsithermal phase (isotopic event 7.5) of MIS 7e. 589 

 The sedimentary record exposed along Chuí Creek indicates that the marine-terrestrial 590 

transition was gradual and occurred around 230 ka BP. This transition is coincident with an interval 591 

of low Southern Hemisphere insolation and probably high pluviosity, which produced high input of 592 

terrigenous sediments through washouts and increased fluvial activity.  593 

The ages also improve the chronology of the Pleistocene barrier-lagoon depositional systems 594 

of the CPRS, by showing that the Barrier-Lagoon System II was formed around 230 ka BP rather 595 

than 325 ka BP (MIS 9), as previously proposed. This leaves open the question of whether the older 596 

system (Barrier-Lagoon I) is correlated to MIS 9 or represents an older transgression. 597

ABSTRACT - A marine molluscan assemblage is described from four fossil concentrations in the 
Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The concentrations were found at the 
same stratigraphic interval, some 7.5 meters above present sea-level, in a layer deposited in shallow 
marine environment and currently exposed along the banks of Chuí Creek, located some 11 km 
landwards of the present coastline. The assemblage is composed of a mixture of highly fragmented, 
unidentifiable shells and well-preserved bivalves and gastropods. Many bivalve remains are 
complete, including juveniles and thin-shelled taxa, lacking signs of abrasion or bioerosion. The 
origin of the shell concentrations is interpreted as a short-termed depositional event, generated by 
storms, in shallow water settings under a marine transgressive regime. The predominant taxa in the 
assemblage are infaunal, stenohaline bivalves that inhabit shallow sandy bottoms, with few 
gastropods and epifaunal organisms. Most of the taxa have living representatives today in the 
southern Brazilian coast, indicating a mixture of Argentinean and Caribbean (or Brazilian) 
malacological provinces. The presence of taxa that indicate warm waters (Anomalocardia 
brasiliana, Chione paphia, C. cancellata, Anadara brasiliana and Arcinella brasiliana), that are not 
found living today in the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, suggests warmer oceanographic conditions 
coinciding with past sea-level highstands, also indicated by similar taxa found in fossil 
concentrations in the Uruguayan and Argentinean coasts. A discussion of the stratigraphic position, 
age and correlation of this assemblage with other outcrops is also presented.

RESUMO - Aqui é descrita uma assembléia de moluscos marinhos a partir de quatro concentrações 
fossilíferas encontradas na Planície Costeira do estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. As 
concentrações foram encontradas na mesma posição estratigráfica, aproximadamente 7,5 metros 
acima do nível atual do mar, em uma camada depositada em ambiente marinho raso e atualmente 
exposta nas barrancas do Arroio Chuí, localizado a aproximadamente 11 km da linha de costa atual. 
A assembleia é composta por uma mistura de conchas altamente fragmentadas, nãoidentificáveis, 
bem como bivalves e gastrópodes bem preservados. Muitos bivalves são completos, incluindo

juvenis e táxons de conchas finas, sem sinais de abrasão ou bioerosão. A origem dessas 
concentrações é interpretada como um evento deposicional de curta duração, gerado por 
tempestade, em águas rasas sob regime marinho transgressivo. Os táxons predominantes na 
assembleia são bivalves estenohalinos infaunais que habitam fundos arenosos rasos, com poucos 
gastrópodes e organismos epifaunais. A maioria dos táxons ainda habita a costa sul do Brasil, 
indicando uma mistura das províncias malacológicas Argentina e Caribenha (ou Brasileira). A 
presença de táxons indicativos de águas mais quentes (Anomalocardia brasiliana, Chione paphia, 
C. cancellata, Anadara brasiliana and Arcinella brasiliana), que não são encontrados vivendo 
atualmente na costa do Rio Grande do Sul, sugere condições oceanográficas mais quentes, 
coincidentes com durante máximos transgressivos marinhos no passado, também indicadas por 
concentrações fósseis encontradas em depósitos do Holoceno nas costas da Argentina e Uruguai. A 
posição estratigráfica, idade e correlação desta assembleia com outros afloramentos são discutidas.

INTRODUCTION  

The southernmost portion of the 
Brazilian coast comprises the Coastal Plain of 
Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS), a 
geomorphological unit formed by successive 
sea-level oscillations during the Neogene and 
Quaternary (Tomazelli et al., 2000). The CPRS 
is known for the presence of several deposits of 
marine fossils, located both on the continental 
shelf (Figueiredo Jr, 1975) and continental 
areas far from the Present-day coastline. The 
latter were studied by several authors (Bianchi, 
1969; Closs &amp;amp; Forti, 1971; Forti Esteves, 1974; 
Godolphim et al., 1989), but focusing mostly on 
the taxonomic composition of the fossil 
assemblages, rather than their stratigraphy or 
paleoecology. From the Santa Vitória do 
Palmar County, in the southern CPRS, Closs &amp;amp; 
Forti (1971) described several fossil marine 
mollusks, found in four outcrops in continental 
areas, including the Chuí Creek. These fossils, 
however, were described without any indication 
of their stratigraphic origin, and probably 
represent material that was found out of their 
original depositional setting, reworked by 
erosive processes resulting from fluvial activity.  
 During recent surveys in the Chuí 
Creek, four concentrations of marine fossil 
shells were found on their original stratigraphic 
position, at the base of the banks of the creek. 
These concentrations were briefly described by 
Lopes &amp;amp; Simone (2012), but focusing mostly 
on new fossil records of molluscan taxa. Here is 

presented an expanded report on these 
concentrations, encompassing the systematics, 
taphonomy, paleoenvironmental and 
stratigraphic implications of these

fossil shells reported by Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 The CPRS is formed by sediments 
accumulated in the coastal area of southern 
Brazil after the South America and Africa 
break-up, during the  Late Cretaceous. These 
sediments filled-up the Pelotas Basin, the 
southernmost marginal sedimentary basin in the 
Brazilian coast (Closs, 1970). During the Late 
Pleistocene-Early Holocene, four major sea-
level transgressions correlated to interglacial 
phases reworked the uppermost portion of the 
basin. Each transgression originated a long 
sandy barrier system on the coastline and 
coastal lagoons located landwards, named 
Barrier-Lagoon Systems I, II, III and IV, 
correlated to marine isotope stages 11, 9, 5 and 
1, respectively, following the oxygen (?18O) 
curves of Imbrie et al. (1984, in Villwock &amp;amp; 
Tomazelli, 1995).  
 The Chuí Creek flows subparallel to the 
coastline in a NE-SW direction between the 
Pleistocene barriers II and III, through the plain 



that is part of the Lagoon System III (Figure 
1A, B). In its lower course, the creek makes a 
southeastwards turn following the Chuí faulting 
zone until reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The 
creek channel was originally shallow, but was 
further excavated for agricultural purposes in 
the early 1960s. During this, a marine sand 
layer was exposed, underlying sediments that 
contain remains of Pleistocene mammals 
(Figure 1C). Soliani Jr. (1973) correlated the 
marine layer to the “Chuí Formation” of 
Delaney (1965), and named the overlying 
fossiliferous layer as “Santa Vitória 
Formation”. Under the chronostratigraphic 
scheme proposed for the description of the 
geology of the CPRS by Villwock et al. (1986), 
which replaced the classical lithostratigraphic 
scheme of Delaney (1965), the marine 
sediments are identified as the shallow marine 
facies deposited during the sea-level highstand 
that originated the Barrier System II and 
underlies the youngest sediments of Lagoon 
System III (Lopes et al., 2011; Rosa, 2012). 
 The marine sand deposit is composed of 
fine, well-sorted, well-rounded and mature 
sand, with parallel and cross stratifications. The 
sand is essentially composed of quartz and 
contains small amounts (less than 10%) of 
heavy minerals and carbonate fragments of 
biogenic origin; the uppermost centimeters of 
this layer are reddish due to iron oxide coating 
resulting from subaerial exposure. Ichnofossils 
Ophiomorpha nodosa (Lopes et al., 2001), 
Rosselia sp. and other unidentified traces are 
commonly found, and indicate shallow coastal 
waters (Weimer &amp;amp; Hoyt, 1964; Frey et al., 
1978; Pollard et al., 1993; Nara, 2002). Some 2 
meters of this facies remain exposed above the 
creek bed; its total thickness is of at least 10 
meters, based on direct observation of drilling 
activities made for building purposes near the 
creek. 

The marine sand deposit is covered by a 
sediment layer containing the mammalian 
remains and generated in fluvial systems (Lopes 
et al., 2009). The oldest age for a fossil 
mammal tooth obtained by ESR dating (226 ± 
35 kyr BP) indicates that the marine facies 
below corresponds to the marine isotope stage 
(MIS) 7 (Lopes et al., 2010), a conclusion

also reinforced by ESR datings on shells from 
this facies (Lopes et al., 2012). The layer with 
mammalian remains is covered by sandy silt 
probably of loessic origin (Lopes et al., 2011);   
the uppermost portion of the sedimentary 
sequence is composed of organic matter-rich 
sand and clay, containing fossil remains 
indicative of wetland environments and 
archaeological structures (Schmitz et al., 1997). 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Previous descriptions of fossils of 
marine mollusks found in the Chuí Creek were 
presented by Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971) and Forti 
Esteves (1974). The fossils described by those 
authors were collected in four different 
outcrops: on the bridge over Chuí Creek 
(sample E3, Figure 1B); on dredged sediments 
piled near the road between the town of Santa 
Vitória do Palmar and Hermenegildo Beach 
(sample E4, not shown in the figure); some 4 
km to the south of the town of Chuí, in the 
Brazilian-Uruguayan border (samples E1 and 
E2), and some 50 km to the northeast of the 
town of Santa Vitória (sample E5, also not in 
the figure). 

During the field work on the creek in 
2010, when the water table was very low due to 
a drought, a concentration of fossil marine 
shells (M002) was found exposed at the base of 
the right bank of the creek (Figure 1C, D), some 
2 km to the north of the bridge on the road 
between the town of Santa Vitória do Palmar 
and Hermenegildo Beach. Two other 
concentrations (M001 and M004) were 
identified in the left and right banks, 
respectively, at the same stratigraphic position 
of M002, but some 600 m to the north of the 
bridge. The specimens collected from these 
outcrops were the basis for the paper by Lopes 
&amp;amp; Simone (2012); later, a fourth concentration 

(M003) was found in the left bank some tens of 
meters to the south of M002.  

The term “concentration” is used here to 
designate a densely-packed shell accumulation 
sensu Kidwell &amp;amp; Holland (1991). Each 
concentration is formed by a patch of densely 
packed (sensu Kidwell &amp;amp; Holland, 1991), 
decimetric thick layer (Figure 1D) of clustered 
and chaotically-oriented shells; smaller 
specimens are found nested within larger ones. 
Above this layer shell remains are scarce and 
disperse on the sandy matrix until disappearing 
some 15 cm upwards. A remarkable feature 
found in M003 is an ichnofossil Ophiomorpha 
nodosa that vertically crosses the shell 
concentration (Figure 1E). The total lateral 
extension of each concentration is yet unknown, 
because the adjacent banks remain covered by 
alluvium, but the absence of shells in portions 
of the creek between the outcrops M002, M003 
and M001/04 suggest that each one is a single 
concentration rather than a laterally continuous 
shell bed. The physical proximity of some 20 
meters between the outcrops M001 (in the left 
bank) and M004 (in the right bank) suggests 
that both may represent the same accumulation. 
The outcrop M001 is visible on a gully 
transversal to the left margin of the creek, 
which shows that the fossil shell concentration 
extends in subsurface for at least 10 meters 
eastwards of the creek.  

The bulk samples collected from each 
outcrop were washed and particles smaller than 
2 mm were separated by using a sieve, in order 
to remove fragments that are not considered 
bioclasts sensu Kidwell &amp;amp; Holland (1991); 
identifiable specimens were hand picked among 
the remaining fragments. Identification was 
based on the compendia of Brazilian seashells 
(Rios 1994, 2009) and comparison with 
reference specimens from MZUSP and FURG. 
 
RESULTS 

 
Taxonomic composition of the assemblage 

Although most of the remains are 
unidentifiable fragments, a total of 708 
specimens were identified at the species level 
(TABLE 1, Figures 2 and 3). All four 
concentrations are composed by the same taxa, 



except for those represented by a single 
individual. Besides the new records described 
by Lopes &amp;amp; Simone (2012), six other taxa not 
previously recorded from this assemblage were 
collected in the outcrop M003: the bivalves 
Anadara brasiliana, A. chemnitzi and Erodona 
mactroides, and the gastropods Buccinanops 
gradatus, B. duartei and Terebra gemmulata). 
         The analysis of the shells shows a 
predominance of bivalves (95% of the 
specimens) over gastropods, both in species 
richness and total number of individuals 
(TABLE 2). The remains include mostly sandy 
bottom dwellers that inhabit the intertidal to 
infralittoral zone. Most of the species are 
stenohaline; the only taxon that usually inhabits 
brackish waters is Erodona mactroides, 
represented by two individuals. The gastropods 
and some bivalves are epifaunal, but most 
bivalves are infaunal taxa. All the gastropods 
found in the assemblage are taxa that live today 
in the southern Brazilian shelf, except for 
Lamniconus lemniscatus carcellesi, a taxon that 
currently does inhabit Argentinean and 
Uruguayan waters but is not found in Brazil 
(Rios, 1994; 2009; Lopes &amp;amp; Simone, 2012). 
The bivalves Chione paphia, C. cancellata, 
Arcinella brasiliana, Anadara brasiliana and 
Anomalocardia brasiliana are not recorded 
among living molluscan assemblages of the 
coast of Rio Grande do Sul (e.g. Absalão, 1986, 
1991; Borzone, 1988; Capitoli, 2002; Wigger &amp;amp; 
Veitenheimer-Mendes, 2003; Pimpão, 2004), 
although found living in other areas of the 
Brazilian coast. 
 Of the 35 species recorded, 10 belong to 
the Caribbean/Brazilian malacological province 
and 10 to the Argentinean; 12 occur on both 
Argentinean and Caribbean provinces and 3 
occur on both Argentinean and Magellanic 
provinces (Figure 4). 
 
Preservation 

The shells were divided in two groups, 
according to their preservational state: Group I 
is composed of highly abraded, unidentifiable 
and sometimes corroded and/or bioeroded 
fragments, and Group II, composed of 708 
specimens, either complete (85% of the total) or 
incomplete (15%). The term  

 
Figure 4 – Relative percentages of taxa belonging 
to the Caribbean/Brazilian, Argentinean and 
Magellanic malacological provinces. 
 
incomplete is used here to describe specimens 
that although broken, still have at least 50% of 
the shell preserved.  

All specimens are, white-colored and 
without periostracum, except for a few Chlamys 
tehuelchus and two ostreids that exhibit traces 
of the original color pattern, and the Tegula 
patagonica, that exhibits traces of the original 



color and the pearly internal lining. The 
complete fossils of Group II do not exhibit 
signs of abrasion; the corrosion seen in 45.3% 
of these fossils (Figure 5A) was probably 
caused by exposure to acidic water. Good 
preservation is observed even among fragile 
shells, such as those of small juvenile 
individuals and thin-shelled taxa (e.g. Mactra 
janeiroensis). 
All bivalves are represented by disarticulated 
valves, except for six Corbula caribaea that 
were found with valves still closed articulated. 
32% of the shells exhibit signs of bioerosion; 
one specimen of M. janeiroensis exhibits a 
Caulostrepsis ichnofossil (Figure 5B) and one 
specimen of Pitar rostratus exhibits 
ichnofossils Entobia (Figure 5C). Ichnogenera 
Pennatichnus or Maeandropolydora have not 
been observed on the bivalves, although these 
are common in shells from other fossil 
concentrations. On the other hand, 8 specimens, 
including 5 ostreids, exhibit ichnofossils 
Oichnus (Figure 5D) that are virtually absent 
among fossils found in other localities of CPRS 
(Lopes and Buchmann, 2008; Lopes, 2012). 
One ostreid (Figure 5E) and one pectinid 
(Figure 3L) exhibit ovoid borings (cf. 
ichnogenus Gastrochaenolites isp.); another 
ostreid exhibit several borings of Entobia and 
Caulostrepsis (Figure 5F).  
Most of the gastropods are poorly preserved in 
comparison to the bivalves. The specimens of 
Zidona dufresnei and most Adelomelon 
brasiliana are broken; both taxa also exhibit 
signs of corrosion and ichnofossils Entobia and 
Caulostrepsis (Figure 2F, G). The only other 
gastropod that exhibit bioerosion by Entobia, 
Caulostrepsis and also Pennatichnus is one 
specimen of Olivancillaria urceus (Figure 2J). 
The latter also exhibits traces tentatively 
assigned to the ichnogenus Clionoides sp. 
(Lopes, 2012). 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Comparison with other fossil assemblages 
 In the southern sector of the CPRS, two 
other concentrations of fossil marine shells are 
found, one in the southwestern margin of 

Mangueira Lake, at the locality known as Passo 
da Lagoa, and the other, known as Concheiros, 
is found on the present shoreline, close to the 
Brazilian-Uruguayan border (Lopes &amp;amp; 
Buchmann, 2008). The fossils from Passo da 
Lagoa are found among sediments dredged 
from the bottom of the lake, thus their 
stratigraphic position is still unknown. The 
Concheiros are formed by fossils transported 
from the continental shelf to the beach by storm 
waves (Figueiredo Jr., 1975; Buchmann, 2002; 
Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2008), thus actually 
represent several storm-generated 
concentrations (multiple event concentrations, 
sensu Kidwell, 1991). The fossil deposits of the 
continental shelf, which constitute the source 
for the material accumulated on the beach, are 
likely to be lag deposits formed during past 
marine transgressions that are being reworked 
today by the erosive processes affecting the 
southern coast of Rio Grande do Sul 
(Dillenburg et al., 2004). 
 

The main taxonomic difference between 
the fossils from the Passo da Lagoa and 
Concheiros and those from Chuí Creek is the 
scarcity of the bivalve Glycymeris longior on 
the latter (only two specimens found), while it 
is common in Concheiros (72% of the 
specimens) and Passo da Lagoa (18%) (Lopes 
&amp;amp; Buchmann, 2008). The co-occurrence of both 
shallow living taxa such as Amiantis purpuratus 
and deeper dwellers such as G. longior 
indicates that the assemblages of Concheiros 
and Passo da Lagoa do not represent paleo-
communities, but were formed by 
sedimentological processes related to sea-level 
oscillations. During a marine transgression, the 
rising sea-level would erode the shallow areas, 
removing finer sediments and leaving coarser 
ones (including fossils) concentrated on the 
ravinement surface, thus forming a 
transgressive lag deposit. The deeper-living 
taxa would also have their distribution 
expanded landwards following the rising sea-
level, and would accumulate on top of the 
remains of shallow living taxa. During a sea-
level lowering, such as seen today in most of 
the coast of Rio Grande do Sul for the last 6 ka

(Dillenburg et al., 2004), these lag deposits 
would be eroded and the fossil shells 
transported to the beach, mixing together fossil 
remains of taxa that inhabit different depths. A 
similar process seems to be responsible for the 
abundance on the coastline of fossil remains of 
the echinoid Encope emarginata that inhabits 
the infralittoral (Lopes, 2011a).  
 
Taphonomy 

The assemblage from Chuí Creek is 
composed of well-preserved remains, 
concentrated together with highly fragmented 

and abraded unidentifiable shells. Good 
preservation may result of less exposure time 
on the taphonomically active zone (TAZ, sensu 
Davies et al., 1989), while longer exposure 
times cause the destruction of more fragile 
shells, such as juveniles, small and thin-shelled 
taxa, and result in highly abraded and corroded 
specimens (Driscoll, 1970; Brandt, 1989; 
Davies et al., 1989a, b; Kidwell, 1989). A 
survey among complete specimens of the most 
abundant bivalves (A. purpuratus, P. rostratus 
and M. janeiroensis) shows that these include 
elements of all ontogenetic stages (Figure 6), 
with predominance of juveniles. If the transport 
took longer time or the burial of these remains 
was delayed, it would be unlikely that the shells 
of juvenile individuals, more fragile in 
comparison to adults, would have been 
preserved. Studies have shown that shells of 
juveniles are more readily destroyed by 
currents, waves and dissolution, thus are often 
underrepresented in fossil concentrations 
(Cummins et al., 1986; Kidwell, 1989; Kidwell 
&amp;amp; Bosence, 1991).  

The estimated time of survival of shells 
in nearshore environments is shorter than in the 
shelf (Flessa &amp;amp; Kowalewski, 1994; Carroll et 
al., 2003; Krause et al., 2010) due to continuous 
mechanical reworking by waves and chemical 
dissolution while exposed on the water-
sediment interface or buried within the zone 
affected by bioturbation. Because the 
sedimentation rates are usually lower than the 
rates of chemical destruction (dissolution) of 
the shells (Davies et al., 1989b), the good 
preservation seen in many specimens indicates 
either an elevated rate of sedimentation during 
their final burial, or that these specimens have 
died shortly before burial, thus were exposed on 
the TAZ for a brief interval. Most of the 
bivalves found here are infaunal (spend most of 
their lives buried in the sediment), so it is likely 
that these could have died and remained 
articulated within the sediment, which 
prevented biogenic or mechanical reworking, 
until their removal and disarticulation by a 
storm event, after which the remains would 
have been buried under a thick sediment layer 
below the TAZ (depth of final burial, or DFB, 
sensu Olszewski, 2004). The presence of at

length of complete, well-preserved specimens of 
the most abundant bivalve taxa found in Chuí 
Creek. 
 
least one Ophiomorpha nodosa preserved in 
association with the fossil concentration M003 
(Figure 2E), plus six individuals of C. caribaea 
and several yet undescribed ostracods found 
with the valves still closed, reinforce the 
interpretation that the assemblage has not been 
reworked since their burial. 

The specimens that are broken, 
bioeroded and/or corroded probably remained 
in the TAZ for longer periods. Among 
Holocene molluscan assemblages from 
Argentina, Aguirre &amp;amp; Farinatti (1999a) 
observed that infaunal bivalves (e.g. Mactra 
isabelleana, Pitar rostratus) are better 
preserved than epifaunal taxa. Lazo (2004) 
found similar results for the bivalve Protothaca 
stamina, which exhibits both infaunal and 

epifaunal behavior. The poor preservation 
among the larger gastropod shells (A. brasiliana 
and Z. dufresnei) could have resulted from 
transportation of these specimens from their 
living areas (between 15 and 77 m in depth 
according to Rios, 1994) to the shoreline. 
Although predation is also a possible source of 
breakage on shells (Cate &amp;amp; Evans, 1994; 
Alexander &amp;amp; Dietl, 2003; Zuschin et al., 2003), 
no conclusive evidence of such activity was 
identified among the specimens. It seems, 
however, that the high degree of bioerosion 
seen in some specimens was directly related to 
the breaking of the shell (see figure 5c). 

Most of the dissolution that affects the 
shells occurs in the sediment-water interface 
and within the zone affected by bioturbation 
(Driscoll, 1970; Davies et al., 1989a; Walker &amp;amp; 
Goldstein, 1999). Some processes related to 
storm events such as removal of organic matter, 
quick burial below the TAZ, and winnowing, 
that causes the shells to become densely 
packed, also contribute for reducing or avoiding 
the destruction of shells by dissolution (Cherns 
et al., 2008). Dissolution after burial should 
have been minimal, considering the presence 
together with the shells of well-preserved 
foraminifer tests (Lopes &amp;amp; Bonetti, 2012) and 
ostracod carapaces. On the other hand, a single 
storm event could not have imprinted the 
taphonomic signature (corrosion and abrasion) 
visible in the unidentifiable fragments (Davies 
et al., 1989a), thus the poor preservation of 
these remains indicates that they were 
continuously reworked in shallower areas 
within the depths affected by waves prior to 
their final burial together with the well-
preserved shells. 
 The shells from Chuí Creek resemble 
those found in Passo da Lagoa, with white to 
light grey color, while those from the 
Concheiros are dark grey to reddish (Lopes &amp;amp; 
Buchmann, 2008). The color variation seen 
among the shells from submarine deposits is 
probably caused by incorporation of iron, 
manganese and other components dissolved in 
the seawater. Coimbra et al. (2009) found 
oxidized glauconitic coatings on Neogene 
foraminiferal tests from the southern Brazilian 
shelf, attributing it to a combination of 



glauconite incorporation under marine 
conditions and oxidization due to sea-level 
change. The absence of color in shells from 
both the Passo da Lagoa and Chuí Creek 
suggest that this feature is caused by a 
combination of less time of exposition to 
marine conditions after death and the influence 
of acidic freshwater after sea-level retreatment.  

The amount of specimens affected by 
bioerosion is similar in the three assemblages 
(32% in Chuí Creek, 22% in Passo da Lagoa 
and 37% in the Concheiros). In soft bottom 
coasts such as in southern Brazil, any dead 
skeletal remain is a potential substrate for 
colonization by epi- and endoskeletozoans, and 
the longer these skeletons remain exposed on 
the water-sediment interface, higher will be the 
amount of bioerosion. Remarkably, the most 
common ichnofossil observed among the shells 
from Chuí Creek is Oichnus, virtually absent 
from the other two concentrations (Lopes &amp;amp; 
Buchmann, 2008; Lopes, 2012). This 
ichnogenus, however, indicates predatory 
activity by gastropods, thus it is not produced 
on dead remains, although cases of erroneous 
attacks by predators on dead shells are possible 
(Kelley &amp;amp; Hansen, 2003; Simões et al., 2007). 
The gastropods that exhibit bioerosion (Z. 
dufresnei, A. brasiliana and O. urceus) are 
epifaunal taxa that inhabit depths below the 
influence of normal waves (some 10-12 m) and 
are much larger than the bivalves, thus are 
likely to remain exposed for a long time period 
and be subject to the action of bioeroders after 
death. Bioerosion could have been also 
produced while the hosts were still alive, at 
least concerning Caulostrepsis, produced by 
spionid polychaetes, as it was recorded in 
brachiopods (Rodrigues et al., 2008). This trace 
was observed on the external surface of one 
Mactra (Figure 5b) ostreids (figure 5F) and one 
gastropod (figure 2J), thus it is possible that 
these individuals could have been infested 
while still alive, as is the case of fossil oysters 
(bioeroded mostly on the external surfaces of 
the valves) from the continental shelf (Lopes, 
2011b; 2012). The Entobia observed on the 
external surface of Adelomelon and Zidona, 
which are epifaunals, could also have been 
produced while these were still alive.  

The characteristics of this assemblage 
suggest that its deposition was a short-termed 
process. A plausible scenario would be the 
erosion of the lower shoreface and 
transportation of well-preserved shell remains 
to shallower zone by storm waves, followed by 
their final burial together with highly reworked 
fragments at the DBF. This process would be 
similar to what is seen today in the Concheiros: 
during autumn and winter, storm waves deposit 
in the upper shoreface large amounts of fossil 
shells transported from the lower shoreface, 
concentrating them together with smaller shell 
fragments that are continuously reworked and 
abraded in the surf zone, while during summer 
and spring, when storm surges are rare, these 
deposits remain above the range of waves and 
are covered by sand when the beach recovers 
the summer profile and also by sand blown 
from the foredunes (Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2008). 
The deposits formed in the shoreface exhibit 
layers of fossil shells with variable thickness, 
interspersed with sand layers (Figure 7). 
 
Paleoecology and Paleobiogeography 
 The relative absence of articulated and / 
or specimens in life position, plus the mixing of 
unidentifiable fragments and complete 
specimens indicate that the concentrations are 
sedimentological in origin, rather than 
representing a paleo-community preserved in 
situ. These concentrations can be considered 
parautochtonous, formed by dead remains of 
shallow-living taxa reworked in their habitat 
(Kidwell et al., 1986), concentrated together 
with allochtonous elements that were 
transported from their original living areas such 
as deep-living taxa (Z. dufresnei and A. 
brasiliana), hard bottom dwellers 
(Bostrycapulus odites, Diodora patagonica) 
and inhabitants of brackish-water environments 
(Erodona mactroides). 

Most of the taxa found in this 
assemblage live today in the southern Brazilian 
coast (Borzone, 1988; Absalão, 1991; Gianuca, 
1998; Capítoli, 1998; 2002), but some taxa (e.g. 
M. guidoi, M. janeiroensis) are not common

Although living in most areas of the Brazilian

Chione paphia, C. cancellata, Anadara 
brasiliana and Arcinella brasiliana are not 
found today in the coast of Rio Grande do Sul 
state; their southernmost distribution confirmed 
so far is the northern neighboring state of Santa 
Catarina (Figure 8; Veitenheimer-Mendes &amp;amp; 
Lopes-Pitoni, 1995; Klein et al., 2001; Almeida 
et al., 2004; Caregnato et al., 2009; Rodrigues 
et al., 2010). Although the current distribution 
of Anomalocardia has been described as 
reaching up to the Uruguayan coast (Rios, 
1994; 2009), this taxon is not found living 
today in that area (Scarabino, 2003); Absalão 
(1986) mentioned one single specimen of 
Anomalocardia collected in the coast of Rio 
Grande do Sul, without specifying whether it 
was a living individual or just an isolated valve. 
Considering the presence of large 
concentrations of fossil and subfossil shells on 
the continental shelf (Figueiredo Jr., 1975; 
Lopes &amp;amp; Buchmann, 2008), containing other 
taxa that do not inhabit the southern Brazilian 
shelf today (Simões et al., 2011) it seems 
probable that the material mentioned by that 
author do not represent a recent individual. 

Anomalocardia and other ‘Brazilian’ 
taxa (e.g. Anadara brasiliana, C. cancellata,  

 
Bulla striata, among others) have been 

found in late Pleistocene and early-middle 
Holocene fossil deposits in the coastal areas of 
Uruguay and Argentina, at latitudes up to 38°S 
(Figure 10), and their presence so far to the 
south is considered as an indicator of conditions 
warmer than today around 6-4.5 kyr BP 
(Aguirre, 1993; Gordillo, 1998; Clavijo et al., 
2005; Martínez et al., 2006; Aguirre et al., 
2011). The interval between ~10 and 5 kyr BP 
corresponds to the Holocene climatic optimum, 
(Hypsithermal) marked by warmer temperatures 
in high latitudes (Emiliani, 1972; Rabassa, 
1987; Ciais et al., 1992). Aguirre &amp;amp; Farinatti 
(1999b) found a higher proportion (35%) of 
warm water mollusks (of the 
Caribbean/Brazilian malacological province) in 
middle Holocene fossil deposits of the 
Argentinean coast than in present-day 
assemblages (14%). Because the distribution of 
the Caribbean/Brazilian province is controlled 
by the warm Brazilian Current (Martínez &amp;amp; Del 
Río, 2002), a higher southern influence of this 
current during past interglacials has been 
considered the factor responsible for the 
southwards displacement of molluscan taxa that

Anomalocardia brasiliana along the Brazilian 
coast and its range during the late 
Pleistocene/early-middle Holocene. The 
distribution of Arcinela brasiliana, Anadara 
brasiliana, Chione cancellata and C. paphia is 
similar. The capital letters indicate the areas of 
the Caribbean/Brazilian (B), Argentinean (A)

black dot indicates the location of Chuí Creek. 
 
today reach only up to southern Brazil (Aguirre, 
1993; Martínez &amp;amp; Del Río, 2005). 

The oceanographic conditions in the 
area that encompasses southern Brazil, Uruguay 
and the Bonaerensian coast of Argentina (up to 
~41°S) are controlled basically by the interplay 
between the warm Brazilian Current (BC) and 
the cold Malvinas Current (MC), which is a 
branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current 
(ACC). The convergence between these two 
currents forms the Brazilian-Malvinas 
Confluence (BMC), which is subject to 
seasonal latitudinal shifts that characterize the 
Subtropical Front (STF). The southwards 
influence of the BC is stronger during austral 
summer, while during austral winter the pattern 
is reversed, when the ACC (and consequently 

the MC) are intensified; thus the intensity of the 
MC seems to exert control on the maximum 
southern reach of the BC (Matano et al., 1993; 
Wainer et al., 2000).  

Several records have shown that during 
the Holocene hypsithermal, between ~10 and 5 
kyr BP, the surface waters around Antarctica 
were warmer and ice-free, suggesting a 
polewards retreatment of the Subantarctic 
(SAF) and Polar (PF) fronts (Domack et al., 
2001; Hodell et al., 2001; Lamy et al., 2002). It 
seems likely that during past hypsithermals this 
retreatment resulted in weakened ACC and 
consequent reduction in the equatorwards 
influence of the MC, thus allowed the BC to 
reach farther south than during colder intervals. 
Besides, paleotemperatures obtained from 
foraminiferal tests found in drilling cores 
indicate temperatures between 1 and 5°C 
warmer than today for the waters surrounding 
Antarctica during the early phases of the last 
five interglacials (Becquey &amp;amp; Gersonde, 2003). 
Thus it seems possible that these warmer 
conditions would have allowed a southwards 
expansion of tropical to subtropical taxa. The 
age of some 235 thousand years for these shells 
(see below) is correlated with an hypsithermal 
phase of the penultimate interglacial; the 
foraminiferal assemblage found associated with 
the shells also point to warmer conditions 
(Lopes &amp;amp; Bonetti, 2012). 

The current southernmost distribution 
(28oS) of the ‘Brazilian’ taxa found here is 
coincident with mean sea surface temperature 
(SST) of 21oC, while in the latitude of Chuí 
Creek it is of 18oC (Garcia, 1998; de Castro et 
al., 2006). If temperature was the key 
environmental factor controlling the distribution 
of those taxa, then it is reasonable to assume 
that mean SSTs during past hypsithermals were 
at least 3oC warmer than today.   

Anomalocardia was also recorded in 
fossil concentrations formed by the Holocene 
marine highstand around 6-5 kyr BP in the 
coast of Rio Grande do Sul (Closs &amp;amp; 
Forti,1971; Buchmann et al., 1998; Caron, 
2007; Lima, 2008), and Caron (2007) also 
reported the presence of C. paphia. This 
suggests that during the Holocene Hypsithermal 
the marine conditions were also warmer than at 



present. The cooler conditions during the 
Neoglacial stage that followed the 
hypsithermal, would led to the Present-day 
conditions of relatively increased influence of 
the Malvinas current, resulting in the 
northwards retreatment of the fauna adapted to 
warmer waters. Although reliable data about 
molluscan faunas correlated to the ~123-kyr 
marine transgression (MIS 5) from Southern 
Brazil are not available yet, Aguirre et al. 
(2011) considered that the high molluscan 
diversity found in deposits of this age in the 
Argentinean coast is also related to warmer 
conditions than at present. Thus, the data 
gathered so far points towards a cyclic pattern 
of southwards displacement of warmer marine 
conditions (and due southwards distribution of 
taxa adapted to warm waters) during the early 
phases of interglacial epochs. Conversely, the 
presence in the southern Brazilian continental 
shelf of late Pleistocene fossils of a brachiopod 
(Magellania cf. M. venosa) that today inhabits 
only the colder waters of Argentina, suggests 
that during glacial times the Magellanic fauna 
had its distribution extended northwards, 
following the displacement of the SAF and PF 
(Simões et al., 2011). Becquey &amp;amp; Gersonde 
(2003) estimated that these fronts suffered a 
northwards shift of ~5° during glacial intervals. 
 
Comparison with previous studies  
 Previous works regarding fossil marine 
mollusks found in the Chuí Creek were 
presented by Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971) and Forti 
Esteves (1974). Although those authors have 
not described the precise stratigraphic position 
of the fossils, they considered that all samples 
were from the “Chuí Formation”, represented 
by the marine sediments exposed at the base of 
the banks of the creek. 
 Delaney (1965) attributed a Pleistocene 
age for the “Chuí Formation”, while Closs &amp;amp; 
Forti (1971) considered it Holocene, and 
correlated it to the “Querandinense” 
transgression and the Vizcaíno Fm. of Uruguay, 
and to the “Belgranense” sediments of 
Argentina. Forti Esteves (1974) mentioned a 
14C age of 5,045 years for fossil shells collected 
4 km to the south of the town of Chuí (outcrop 
E1/E2). Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971) and Forti Esteves 

(1974) considered that all the five outcrops 
represented a single transgressive event, namely 
the Holocene transgression of some 6 kyr BP. 
Sprechmann (1978) also correlated marine 
deposits of the Vizcaíno Formation of Uruguay 
with those described from Santa Vitória do 
Palmar County, but concluded that the latter 
were also of late Pleistocene age.  

Recent research on the outcrop from 
where samples E1/E2 were collected (Caron, 
2007) revealed that this can be confidently 
considered a Holocene deposit, based on a 14C 
age of 5,750 ± 40 years (cal. 6,260-6,080 yr 
BP) for an articulate bivalve (Tagelus plebeius). 
A 14C age of 5,070 ± 70 years (cal. 5,073-5,541 
yr BP) was found for a specimen of M. 
isabelleana from the Uruguayan bank of Chuí 
Creek (Martínez et al., 2006), which is part of 
the same deposit from where the samples E1/E2 
were collected. This deposit represents a 
Holocene estuarine environment, as indicated 
by the muddy sediment and abundance of the 
mollusks T. plebeius (in life position), Erodona 
mactroides and Heleobia australis, and is 
positioned some 2 meters above present sea-
level (Caron, 2007). This deposit is part of of 
the Barrier-Lagoon System IV and represents 
the last marine transgression (MIS 1), that 
reached an estimated amplitude of 4 ± 1 meters 
above present sea-level in southern Brazil 
(Dillenburg &amp;amp; Hesp, 2009), thus it cannot be 
correlated to the fossil assemblage described 
here or to the samples E3, E4 and E5 of Closs 
&amp;amp; Forti (1971).  

Although the fossils of the outcrop E3 of 
Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971) are likely to be remains 
found scattered along the creek bed, removed 
from their original stratigraphic position by 
erosion, they probably came from the same 
stratigraphic level that contains the assemblage 
described here, because no shells were found so 
far in upper levels of the marine facies. The 
remains from E5, however, may represent 
fossils from different stratigraphic settings; 
these were collected among sediments extracted 
during the construction of a small dam in the 
late 1960s, according to verbal communication 
from local people. These shells are not exposed 
on the surface, so additional drillings are 



needed in order to identify their exact 
stratigraphic position. 
 The fossil assemblage described here is 
of Pleistocene age (see below), thus cannot be 
correlated to assemblages from outcrops E1 and 
E2 of Closs &amp;amp; Forti (1971).  
 
Age and stratigraphic significance 
 Fifteen shells from the outcrops M001, 
002 and 004 were dated using electron spin 
resonance (ESR), and provided a mean age 
close to ~235 kyr BP (Lopes et al. 2012). This 
result indicates a late middle Pleistocene age, 
and correlates this assemblage with the MIS 7, 
possibly representing the marine highstand 
during the substage 7.5. The ages are in 
agreement with the stratigraphic position of the 
shells, ESR ages of fossil mammals from the 
overlying sediments (Lopes et al., 2010).  
 The presence of a ~2 meter-thick sand 
layer above the shells, containing ichnofossils 
Ophiomorpha, Rosselia and cross strata 
indicates the persistence of shallow marine 
conditions after the deposition of the shell 
concentrations, until sea-level gradually started 
to fall and sedimentation under terrestrial 
conditions began, as indicated by paleosoils, 
fluvial channels and vertebrate fossils found 
just above the marine facies. The absence of 
faciological or environmental changes above 
the shell concentrations indicate that although 
sea-level continued to rise after the deposition 
of the shells, the total depth did not change 
much. If depth was increasing, one would 
expected to find a greater proportion of mud, 
which accumulates in deeper areas (lower 
shoreface and offshore) below the influence of 
waves (Catuneanu, 2006). The sedimentary 
record, however, shows the persistence of 
shallow-marine conditions, seemingly under 
high rates of sedimentation, punctuated by 
storm events, as indicated by the shell 
concentrations and truncated ichnofossils 
Rosselia sp. Such a scenario of conditions of 
high sedimentation rates under a regime of sea-
level rise is consistent with coastal aggradation 
followed by shoreline progradation, resulting in 
marine regression (Assine &amp;amp; Perinotto, 2001; 
Catuneanu, 2006).  

Because of the low thickness and the 
same stratigraphic position of the shell 
concentrations along the banks of the creek, this 
assemblage can be used as a paleo sea-level 
indicator. Such indicators are scarce in the 
PCRS in comparison to other places of the 
Brazilian coast (e.g. Martin et al., 2003; Angulo 
et al., 2006). These concentrations are placed 
nearly 7.5 meters above present sea-level 
(Lopes &amp;amp; Simone, 2012), but are overlain by ~2 
meters of marine sediments. Thus the total 
amplitude of this transgression was ~9.5 meters 
above present sea-level, higher than the 
transgression that formed Barrier III around 
~123 kyr BP (Tomazelli &amp;amp; Dillenburg, 2007).  
 
CONCLUSIONS 

The fossils described by Lopes &amp;amp; 
Simone (2012) and here are the first record of 
body fossils from sediments of the Barrier 
System II. From the taxonomic composition, 
taphonomy, ecological aspects and stratigraphy 
of this assemblage, several conclusions can be 
drawn:  

 
• Most of the fossil mollusks found in Chuí 

Creek are shallow-living taxa that inhabit 
sandy bottoms, mixed together with 
gastropods from deeper areas and a few hard 
substrate dwellers. This, plus the mixture of 
shells exhibiting very distinct taphonomic 
features indicate that it is a parautochtonous 
assemblage, probably formed by storm 
events. 

 
• Most of the shell material from this 

assemblage is composed of unidentifiable, 
highly abraded shell fragments, as a result of 
continuous reworking by wave action in the 
surf zone. 

 
• The well-preserved shells (lacking signs of 

abrasion, fragmentation and corrosion), 
including fragile juveniles, indicates that 
these remains were buried below the TAZ 
and were not subject to reworking, thus 
preventing further destruction by physical 
and chemical agents. 

 



• The relative absence of corrosion, bioerosion 
or bioincrustation in most of the complete 
shells indicates that these fossils remained for 
a short period exposed in the TAZ prior to 
their final burial, while those that are 
bioeroded and/or corroded were exposed for 
longer periods. 

 
• The assemblage described here is probably 

the source of the fossil molluscan sample E3 
described by Closs and Forti (1971) and Forti 
Esteves (1974) as collected near the bridge 
over Chuí Creek. The stratigraphic position 
of the assemblage and ESR datings, however, 
indicate that these fossils are Pleistocene and 
not Holocene in age, as stated by those 
authors. 

 
• The presence of molluscan taxa that are not 

found living today in the coast of Rio Grande 
do Sul and whose current distribution seems 
related to warmer conditions (Anomalocardia 
brasiliana, Arcinella brasiliana, Anadara 
brasiliana, Chione cancellata and C. 
paphia), also recorded in molluscan 
assemblages from Uruguay and Argentina, 
suggests a weakened Malvinas Current and 
stronger southwards influence of the 
Brazilian Current during this marine 
highstand. 

 
• The presence of taxa that indicate warmer 

conditions in the deposits of late middle 
Pleistocene of Chuí Creek and also in middle 
Holocene deposits of the CPRS, suggests a 
cyclic pattern of warmer oceanographic 
conditions during the hypsithermal phases of 
past interglacials, coincident with marine 
highstands.

Abstract: The Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS), in southern Brazil, encompasses four 
barrier-lagoon depositional systems formed by marine highstands during the Quaternary, but the ages 
of the Pleistocene systems older than ~125 ka BP are not precisely known due to the lack of absolute 
datings. In order to refine the chronology of these deposits, several fossils of terrestrial mammals 
collected in the fluvial facies of the Lagoon System III and fossil shells from the marine facies of the 
Barrier System II, exposed in the southern sector of the CPRS, were subject to dating by electron spin 
resonance (ESR). The ages of the mammalian remains range from  90 ± 10 to 43 ± 3 thousand years, 
thus representing the last glacial cycle (marine isotope stages, or MIS, 4 and 3). The mean EU age of the 
shells is 224 ± 24.6 ka, but this value is considered younger than the 'real' age because of excessive 
Uranium uptake observed among the younger shells. An estimated mean age of some 235 to 238 
thousand years would agree with other ESR and TL ages obtained for fossils and sediments collected 
from beds overlying the shells, and would be consistent with the sea-level hightand at the early MIS 7 
(substage 7e). The presence of bivalves and foraminifers that indicate ocean temperatures higher than 
at present seems to corroborate this estimate, given that MIS 7e was characterized by hypsithermal 
conditions.

ABSTRACT 31 

The Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS), in southern Brazil, encompasses four barrier-32 

lagoon depositional systems formed by marine highstands during the Quaternary, but the ages of 33 

the Pleistocene systems older than ~125 ka BP are not precisely known due to the lack of absolute 34 

datings. In order to refine the chronology of these deposits, several fossils of terrestrial mammals 35 

collected in the fluvial facies of the Lagoon System III and fossil shells from the marine facies of 36 

the Barrier System II, exposed in the southern sector of the CPRS, were subject to dating by 37 

electron spin resonance (ESR). The ages of the mammalian remains range from  90 ± 10 to 43 ± 3 38 

thousand years, thus representing the last glacial cycle (marine isotope stages, or MIS, 4 and 3). 39 

The mean EU age of the shells is 224 ± 24.6 ka, but this value is considered younger than the „real? 40 

age because of excessive Uranium uptake observed among the younger shells. An estimated mean 41 

age of some 235 to 238 thousand years would agree with other ESR and TL ages obtained for 42 

fossils and sediments collected from beds overlying the shells, and would be consistent with the 43 

sea-level hightand at the early MIS 7 (substage 7e). The presence of bivalves and foraminifers that 44 

indicate ocean temperatures higher than at present seems to corroborate this estimate, given that 45 

MIS 7e was characterized by hypsithermal conditions. 46

1. INTRODUCTION 54 

 In recent years, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) technique has been used for dating 55 

speleothems, travertines, marine organisms, terrestrial megafauna and archaeological remains 56 

(Grün, 1989; Rink, 1997; Kinoshita et al., 2008; Blackwell et al., 2010; Kerber et al., 2011). The 57 

physical basis of the ESR method is the measurement of the concentration of unpaired electrons by 58 

ESR spectroscopy. Electrons trapped in defects of the lattice of solid materials are produced by 59 

ionizing radiation emitted by radioactive elements (mainly 238U, 232Th and 40K) present in the 60 

surrounding sediments and within the sample being dated; and from cosmic rays. The total dose  of 61 

natural radiation is called equivalent dose (De) and is proportional to the age. By measuring the 62 

concentration of unpaired electrons trapped in the material and the dose rate from the environment 63 

and radioactive elements in the material itself, the age can be calculated The internal dose rate 64 

depends on the way in which the radioactive elements were incorporated by the sample. Thus some 65 

theoretical models for uranium uptake have been developed and implemented in a computational 66 

algorithm . In the Early uptake (EU) model it is assumed that uranium incorporation occurs in a 67 

short time relative to age and remains constant (Bischoff and Rosenbauer, 1981). This model 68 

corresponds to closed system and provides the minimum age of sample. In the Linear Uptake 69 

model, the absorption of Uranium occurs at a constant rate (Ikeya, 1993). These models were 70 

implemented in the ROSY (Brennan et al 1999) and DATA (Grün, 2009a) software for tooth 71 

dating. In the ROSY software, there is another option, the Combination Uptake model, in which, it 72 

is possible to calculate the ages with different  combinations of the EU and LU for enamel and 73 

dentine. The Recent Uptake (RU) provides de maximum age since it is assumed that the Uranium 74 

present in the tissues was recently incorporated ( Blackwell and Schwarcz 1993). When U-series is 75 



used coupled to ESR, the uptake history can be determined by solving the equation proposed by 76 

Grün et al (1988). This methodology has been applied successfully in several problematic dating 77 

(Grün 2009b; Falgueres et al 2010; Duval et al. 2011; Duval et al. 2012) and it becomes 78 

increasingly important as  the ages increases  and the difference between the ages obtained by 79 

models above mentioned are very large, thus justifying the resources needed to perform this 80 

method. 81 

ESR has been employed for dating Quaternary fossils of mammals, human remains, mainly 82 

using tooth enamel, and shells of both marine and terrestrial mollusks (Molodkov, 1988; 1993; 83 

Engin et al., 2006; Kinoshita et al., 2006). This method is useful for Quaternary fossils because it 84 

can determine ages older than the maximum limit of 14C (about 50,000 years) its upper limit is 85 

dependant on the saturation of defects and signal stability in older samples and on the thermal 86 

stability of the defects (Ikeya and Ohmura, 1981; Radtke et al., 1985; Shimokawa et al., 1992; 87 

Schellmann and Radtke, 1997).  88 

 The coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS, Fig. 1), in southern Brazil,  is a 89 

geomorphological unit formed by successive marine transgressions correlated to glacial cycles of 90 

the Quaternary; the exact ages of the depositional systems, however, are mostly unknown. The only 91 

ages published so far were obtained for sediments from the northern and central sectors of the 92 

CPRS using thermoluminescence (TL) (Poupeau et al., 1988; Buchmann and Tomazelli, 2003), and 93 

shells, peat and mammalian remains from the southern sector using 14C and ESR (Forti Esteves, 94 

1974; Buchmann et al., 1998; Caron, 2007; Lima et al., 2013; Lopes et al., 2010). 95 

 Two major problems concerning the ages of the Pleistocene units of the CPRS are the 96 

predominance of sandy deposits mostly reworked by aeolian activity and/or covered by younger 97 

sediments, and the absence of fossil materials with good stratigraphic control. Although Holocene 98 

shells and peat are found in or near the present-day shoreline, Pleistocene materials in their original 99 

stratigraphic setting are scarce. The only deposit known so far that contains such materials is Chuí 100 



Creek, located in the southern sector of the CPRS. Lopes et al (2010) published seven ESR ages 101 

from mammalian remains from the continental shelf (dated between ~650 and 18 ka BP) and four 102 

from the banks of Chuí Creek, with ages between 226 and 34 ka BP. Although these ages were 103 

useful for refining the stratigraphy, paleobiogeography and paleo sea-level curves for the CPRS, 104 

additional dating on fossils from Chuí Creek are necessary in order to establish more robust 105 

interpretations. Here are presented new results on dating of other mammalian fossils from the creek 106 

and from marine shells collected from a stratigraphic interval that outcrops below the mammalian 107 

remains.   108 

 109 

2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 110 

 The study area encompasses the Chuí Creek, located in the southernmost portion of the 111 

CPRS (Fig. 1A); in this area only three of the four barrier-lagoon depositional systems that form 112 

the CPRS are preserved (Fig. 1B). The creek flows over a plain that is part of the Lagoon III 113 

depositional system, located between the Pleistocene barriers II and III; each barrier was formed in 114 

response to a marine transgression correlated to an interglacial epoch. While the age of the Barrier 115 

System III was found to be correlated to the ~125 ka BP marine transgression (MIS 5), according 116 

to TL datings (Poupeau et al., 1988; Buchmann and Tomazelli, 2003), the age of the Barrier 117 

System II was considered to be of some 325 thousand years, by correlation with the oxygen 118 

isotopic curves of Imbrie et al. (1984) (Villwock and Tomazelli, 1995; Tomazelli et al., 2000). The 119 

Barrier-Lagoon System IV comprises the present coastline and was formed by the marine 120 

transgression around ~6ka BP (Caron, 2007; Lima, 2013). 121 

 The Chuí Creek is the most studied Pleistocene fossiliferous locality of the CPRS. It flows 122 

parallel to the coastline in a NE-SW direction, which changes to NW-SE near the town of Chuí 123 

following the Chuí faulting zone. Prior to the 1960s, the creek was a shallow stream surrounded by 124 

wetlands, but it was further excavated in 1963 for agricultural purposes. During the excavations, a 125 



stratum containing remains of extinct mammals was exposed (Paula Couto and Cunha, 1965). The 126 

fossiliferous interval has been extensively studied in the last 10 years and has provided several new 127 

records of extinct mammals, besides information on past environments and climate conditions in 128 

the area (Lopes et al., 2009, 2011, 2013; Lopes, 2013; Pereira et al., 2012). 129 

Closs and Forti (1971) reported the presence of several species of marine mollusks in the 130 

creek, but did not correlate these remains with any specific stratigraphic interval, thus this material 131 

probably consisted of shell remains scattered on the creek bed due to erosion of the banks, as can 132 

be seen today. Recently, four outcrops containing concentrations of marine shells were discovered 133 

in their original stratigraphic position, exposed at the base of the banks of the creek (Lopes and 134 

Simone, 2012). 135 

 The total height of the banks is of some 4.5 meters (Fig. 2A, B). The lowermost layer is 136 

composed of well-selected, quartz sand with small amounts of biogenic carbonate, heavy minerals 137 

and micas, contains ichnofossils Ophiomorpha nodosa and Rosselia sp., shell concentrations (Fig. 138 

2C) and exhibits parallel and cross stratifications, thus indicating a shallow marine environment 139 

(upper shoreface). Some 2 meters of this layer remain above the creek bed, and although the total 140 

thickness is yet unknown, it measures more than 4 meters, based on soundings with hand auger. In 141 

the first survey of the stratigraphy of Chuí Creek, Soliani (1973) considered the marine sediments 142 

to be part of the “Chuí Formation” of Delaney (1965), while the overlying mammal-bearing 143 

stratum has been assigned to a new unit he called “Santa Vitória Formation”. The reviews on the 144 

geology and stratigraphy of the CPRS in the 1980s led to the replacement of the lithostratigraphic 145 

units by chronostratigraphic units (barrier-lagoon depositional systems) formed by associations of 146 

facies (Tomazelli and Villwock, 2005). Following the new scheme, the marine sediments exposed 147 

along the banks of the creek are part of the marine facies of the Barrier System II. 148 

 After the marine highstand, sea-level retreated and the uppermost portion of the marine 149 

facies was occupied by paleosoils, fluvial systems and possibly small lakes that constitute the 150 



Lagoon System III. The contact between the marine facies and the overlying terrestrial 151 

environment is gradual, except in places where ancient fluvial streams eroded the marine 152 

sediments. These fluvial facies contain remains of Pleistocene terrestrial mammals, mostly 153 

fragmented and isolated, indicating intense erosion and reworking after the fossilization (Lopes, 154 

2009; Lopes et al., 2009). The fossiliferous bed measures between 1.0 and 1.5 meter in thickness, 155 

and is composed of silty sand with root traces and iron oxide concentrations; at some points of the 156 

banks a ~40cm-thick caliche horizon consisting of nodules and rhizocretions is found at its upper 157 

portion. Above the fossiliferous bed the amount of silt increases and vertebrate remains disappear. 158 

The silty layer measures some 1m in thickness, and is covered by a ~50-70 cm-thick layer of 159 

organic matter-rich sand and clay of Holocene age, indicated by the presence of paleoindian 160 

remains (Schmitz et al., 1997).  161 

    162 

3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 163 

 164 

3.1 Fossil Teeth  165 

Six teeth of extinct mammals, three of the notoungulate Toxodon and three of the 166 

proboscidean Notiomastodon (= Stegomastodon) were selected for dating. All remains have been 167 

collected from the fossiliferous level in the banks of Chuí Creek, near the town of Santa Vitória do 168 

Palmar, and belonged to the paleontological collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande 169 

(FURG). Three samples of the surrounding sedimentary matrix containing the fossils were also 170 

collected. considering that the sediments containing mammalian remains are rather homogeneous, 171 

composed mostly of siliciclastic sand deposited and reworked by fluvial systems,. Because the area 172 

is isolated from other fluvial systems since the Barrier II was formed, it is considered here that the 173 

fossil-bearing layer did not receive sediment contributions from external sources that could affect 174 

the results. The humidity of 10% was used to calculate the cosmic ray attenuation. This water 175 



content was estimated considering that the fossils are most of the time located above the water 176 

table (except during winter, when large floods can cover the fossiliferous horizon from periods of 177 

hours to a few days), and the beds above the shells are rather impermeable. The fossils are also too 178 

deep beneath the surface to be reached by plant roots, thus the only humidity that could usually 179 

affect the fossil remains comes from precipitation, but this reaches only the first few centimeters of 180 

the banks. 181 

 Between 2.2g and 5g of enamel and dentine were extracted from the specimens by 182 

mechanical drilling; enamel was separated from dentine using the thermal expansion technique. 183 

The samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for a few minutes and then warmed to room 184 

temperature; this procedure was repeated a few times until enamel was detached from dentine due 185 

to differences in thermal expansion between these two materials. The enamel was then etched in a 186 

1:10 HCl solution for 2 minutes to remove a thin surface layer (approximately 100µm in 187 

thickness). The etched enamel was manually powdered until obtaining a fine (about 500 µm in 188 

diameter) powder which was then divided in 200 mg samples for irradiation  with additive doses 189 

using a radioactive source with known energy (60Co). The final dose of each aliquot was obtained 190 

in a single step, with the same dose rate, to increase the ESR signal. ESR spectrum was recorded in 191 

a JEOL FA-200 X-band spectrometer with the following acquisition parameters: central field 192 

344mT, scan width 10mT, scan time 1min, modulation amplitude 0.1mT, microwave power 2mW, 193 

time constant 100ms. The amplitude peak-peak at g? was used to construct the dose response 194 

curves. The dose-response curve was adjusted using an single saturation exponential function 195 

(Ikeya, 1993): 196 

 197 

(equation 1) 198 

 199 



where I0 is the signal intensity of the saturation signal, D the additive dose and D0 is the 200 

dose at saturation, using instrumental weighing (1/I2) (Grün and Brumby, 1994, Skinner 2000). 201 

Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was used to obtain the concentration of 238U, 232Th and 40K in 202 

enamel, dentin and sediments. Once the De was obtained, the ages of the samples were calculated 203 

using one of the softwares available. Although DATA (Grün, 2009a) has incorporated the most 204 

recent beta attenuation factor, the software  ROSY (Brennan et al., 1999) allows combinations of 205 

uptake models for dentine and enamel and was used in this work. Due to differences on porosities , 206 

the combination uptake (CU) was set as EU for dentine and LU for enamel is the best choice. This 207 

option is in accordance with U-concentration maps obtained by ICPMS that show that U-migration 208 

through the external enamel surface is very small when compared to the bulk of the uranium that 209 

migrated internally through the dentine into the enamel (Grün et al., 2008).  210 

 211 

3.2 Fossil Shells 212 

 Shells were collected from three outcrops exposed at the banks of Chuí Creek (M001, M002 213 

and M004). The three concentrations are at the same stratigraphic horizon, and seem to have been 214 

accumulated by a storm event, thus are considered as a single assemblage. Today, the 215 

concentrations are positioned at the level of the creek, thus are permanently saturated in water. 216 

Shell remains consisted mostly of bivalves, with few gastropods (Lopes and Simone, 2012). One 217 

major concern regarding the suitability of these shells for dating is the fact that most of the bivalves 218 

are disarticulated. Schellmann and Radtke (1997) considered that only well-preserved, articulated 219 

(in living position) bivalves are useful for datings, but the only articulated specimens from Chuí 220 

Creek are six Corbula caribaea, a taxon that is too small to provide reliable results using ESR.  221 

 One sample of the sedimentary matrix surrounding the shells was collected from each 222 

outcrop; the sediments samples are homogeneous, consisting of well-selected, rounded mature 223 



siliciclastic sand. The presence of articulated bivalves and ostracod carapaces indicates that the 224 

shells have not undergone reworking before being collected.  225 

The dating of reworked shells could give a wide range of ages due to time-averaging (e.g. 226 

redeposition of older shells together with much younger material). As an attempt to minimize these 227 

problems, the taxon selected for dating was the bivalve Amiantis purpuratus, because it is abundant 228 

in all outcrops and is a shallow-living species, thus the probability of survival of the shells of dead 229 

individuals for more than 103 years is low, as pointed by studies of the rate of mechanical and 230 

chemical destruction of shells in marine habitats (Flessa and Kowalewski, 1994). Because of the 231 

higher rate of shell destruction in shallow areas, it is expected that well-preserved shells of taxa that 232 

inhabit these areas represent material that was quickly buried shortly after the individuals have 233 

died. Thus, the use of A. purpuratus would in theory avoid large uncertainties that could result 234 

from the larger time-averaging of species that inhabit deeper areas of the continental shelf, where 235 

chemical and mechanical destruction rates are lower (Flessa and Kowalewski, 1994). Besides, 236 

considering that the assemblage seems to have been formed by a short-termed depositional event 237 

and that the shells were covered by marine sediments and were not disturbed until the creek was 238 

excavated, they are probably reliable indicators of the time of deposition of the marine facies. The 239 

use of a single taxon would also exclude variations related to interspecific physical differences, as 240 

pointed by other studies (Shimokawa et al., 1992; Brumby and Yoshida, 1994). 241 

 Five pristine, similar-sized and well-preserved (without signs of abrasion and / or 242 

bioerosion), disarticulated valves of A. purpuratus from each outcrop were selected for dating. The 243 

samples were subject to etching in a 1:10 HCl solution for 1 minute for removal of the surface 244 

layers of the shells (Table 1). After drying, the shells were manually powdered with agate mortar 245 

and pestle; the sediment samples were also manually disaggregated. The resulting powder 246 

(&lt;0.5mm) was separated in subsamples and irradiated with additive doses up to 550Gy using a 247 

radioactive source with known energy (60Co). Aliquots from the fifteen shells and sediment 248 



samples from each outcrop were subject to Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) to determine 238U, 249 

232Th and 40K concentrations The ESR spectra of subsamples were recorded using a X-band 250 

(9.5GHz) JEOL FA-200 spectrometer. The acquisition parameters were: center field 338mT, sweep 251 

width 1.5mT, scan time 1minute, modulation frequency 100kHz, modulation width 0.025mT, time 252 

constant 100ms, microwave power 1mW. The value of the double integration signal was associated 253 

to the additive dose for obtaining the dose-response curve. As performed in the fossil teeth 254 

experiment, the dose-response curve was adjusted using the equation (1) using instrumental 255 

weighing (1/I2) (Grün and Brumby, 1994; Skinner, 2000).  256 

 257 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 258 

4.1 Mammalian remains 259 

In South America there are few Pleistocene fossil localities with both good stratigraphic 260 

control and absolute ages for the associated fossils. This had hampered the biostratigraphic 261 

correlations, that have been based mostly on the Stage/Ages defined from the fossil beds of the 262 

Pampean region of Argentina (Cione and Tonni, 1999; Lopes 2013). The reworked nature of most 263 

fossiliferous units of fluvial origins indicate that absolute datings on fossil remains rather than on 264 

sediments from such deposits is the most reliable way of establishing biostratigraphic correlations. 265 

Table 2 lists concentration of 238U, 232Th and 40K in enamel, dentin and sediments. Table 3 266 

lists the Equivalent Dose (De), early uptake (EU), linear uptake (LU) and combined uptake (CU) of 267 

the fossil teeth. The value of 190 µGy / year was found for cosmic radiation after corrections of 268 

latitude and longitude, altitude (Prescott and Hunton, 1994). The water content of the sediment was 269 

considered 10%, values of 234U / 238U = 1.20 ± 0.20, ?eff = 0.13 ± 0.02 270 

 Although some obtained ages  are older than most of the previously published ages, they are 271 

in agreement with others presented by Lopes et al. (2010). These CU ages are also consistent with 272 

ages obtained for large mammal fossils from the Touro Passo Formation in the western Rio Grande 273 



do Sul state (Kerber et al., 2011), thus reinforcing the biostratigraphic correlation between both 274 

areas and also with those from the Sopas Formation of Uruguay (Ubilla et al., 2009). 275 

 The new ages, together with the results previously published by Lopes et al. (2010), also 276 

help to refine the chronology of the formation of the fossil mammalian assemblage from Chuí 277 

Creek. The ages indicate that most of the fossils represent the time interval between the end of MIS 278 

5 and MIS 3 (roughly between 90 and 30 ky BP); the only specimen dated so far older than this 279 

interval is the aforementioned 226 ka-old tooth of Toxodon, which represents MIS 7 (Fig. 4). These 280 

results in part fill the ~180 thousand years gap between the oldest fossil dated of 226 ± 35 ka and 281 

the next older of 42 ± 3 ka from Chuí Creek (Lopes et al., 2010). The relative absence of specimens 282 

older than 80 ka may be a result of successive reworking and destruction of the fossils from this 283 

location by fluvial action (Lopes, 2009; Lopes et al., 2009). The sedimentary record exposed along 284 

the banks of the creek shows evidences of humid and dry phases, linked to climate oscillations; it is 285 

likely that older fossils have a lower chance of being preserved because of successive reworking by 286 

episodes of fluvial reactivation. The co-occurrence in the same stratigraphic interval of fossils with 287 

such age variation corroborates the existence of several episodes of burial-exhumation-redeposition 288 

of most of the remains and associated sediments (Lopes, 2009).  289 

The identification of the time interval during which these animals lived in southern Brazil 290 

may help to identify the causes that led to their disappearance in this area. Most of the specimens 291 

are chronocorrelated to intervals of milder climates, mostly the MIS 3 interstadial (Figure 4), a 292 

relatively warm interval marked by warm (and cold) pulses in both hemispheres caused by 293 

Dansgaard-Oeschger (and Heinrich) events (EPICA Community Members, 2006; Rabassa and 294 

Ponce, in press). This pattern suggests that the late Pleistocene climatic oscillations affected the 295 

faunal dynamics of the large mammal community that inhabited the area. Several studies have 296 

pointed that the interval between ~50 and ~18 ka BP in south and southeastern Brazil and the 297 

Argentinean Pampas was marked by intercalated dry/humid and cold/warm conditions, followed by 298 



very dry conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between ~25 and ~11 ka BP (Ledru, 299 

1993; Behling and Lichte, 1997; Turcq et al., 1997; Carignano, 1999; Iriondo, 1999). Other 300 

geological records show that during the pre-LGM interval the environmental changes in southern 301 

Brazil were also influenced by insolation-driven millennial-scale oscillations that occurred in the 302 

Northern Hemisphere and affected the patterns of precipitation (Cruz et al., 2005; Wang et al., 303 

2007).  304 

 305 

4.2 Shells 306 

  307 

Figure 3 shows the dose response curve for sample 1 from outcrop M001. The equivalent 308 

dose (De) was determined by fitting with exponential function (Ikeya, 1993) (equation 1).  309 

 Table 4 lists the concentration of  238U, 232Th and 40K  of shells and sediments that were 310 

used to convert De in ages using the software DATA (Grün, 2009a). The value of 116 µGy / year 311 

was found for cosmic radiation after corrections of latitude and longitude, altitude (~7 m a.s.l) and 312 

depth (~4,5 m). The water content of the sediment was considered 100%, because the water table is 313 

at the same level of the shells since the creek was excavated in the early 1960s. Also for the age 314 

calculations the values of 234U / 238U = 1.20 ± 0.20, ?eff = 0.10 ± 0.02 and density = 2.71 ± 0.02 315 

g/cm-3 were adopted following the literature (Blackwell et al., 2010). 316 

The calculated early uptake (EU) and linear uptake (LU) ages for the shells are listed in 317 

Table 5. Because the oldest dated tooth from the fluvial facies above the marine sediments was 318 

dated of 226 ± 35ka (Lopes et al., 2010), it was expected that all shells were older than this; the 319 

results however, show a wide variation. The ages obtained through the EU model range from 140 ± 320 

40 ka to 430 ± 30 ka; the average ages are 266 ± 30 ka for the shells from M001, 222 ± 26 ka for 321 

M002, and 184 ± 18 ka for M004. The mean EU age for the fifteen specimens is of 224 ± 24.6 ka 322 



and corresponds to the average of the minimum age of shells (Ikeya, 1993; Blackwell 1995). The  323 

LU ages range from 570 ± 20 ka to 230 ± 30 ka, with a mean value of 340 ± 31 ka. 324 

 Differences of approximately 120 ka between EU and LU models due to uranium uptake 325 

modeling were also observed by  Schellmann and Radtke (1999), indicating how sensitive this 326 

information can be to the age obtained, thus the results shall be considered as minimum ages, 327 

unless it is assumed that the enrichment has occurred shortly after the burial of the material (Radtke 328 

et al., 1985). Because Early Holocene shells already display uranium concentrations equivalent to 329 

those found in shells from the Last or Penultimate Interglacial, the most reliable ages are those 330 

obtained by the EU model (Schellmann and Radtke, 1997; 1999; 2000). The amount of uranium 331 

found in the fifteen shells was relatively low, ranging from 0.28 to 1.91 ppm (1.09 ppm on 332 

average), thus suggesting that the U-uptake occurred shortly after the shells were deposited; recent 333 

shells exhibit uranium concentrations around 0.2 ppm (Schellmann and Radtke, 1999). 334 

Nevertheless, the specimens with higher U-concentrations are also the ones that exhibit the 335 

younger ages (Fig. 5); as already mentioned, EU ages are the youngest possible (Blackwell, 1995). 336 

The coupled  ESR-US method provides results of age independently of uranium uptake, but as in 337 

this study the US determination was not available, so the entire discussion here is  based on the EU 338 

ages, taking into account that these are probably younger than the „real? ages of the samples.   339 

The U-uptake may be related to the thickness (higher concentrations are usually found in 340 

thinner shells), the type of surrounding matrix (higher in sandy sediments) and the mobility of the 341 

interstitial water (Shimokawa et al., 1992). The sedimentary matrix in which the shells are 342 

embedded is composed of fine sand; the shells themselves were progressively buried beneath a 343 

~4.5 meter-thick sedimentary cover, and although it is not clear how much the water table varied 344 

since their burial, it is probable that they remained below the water table until the creek was 345 

excavated in the early 1960s. Today, the shells are at the mean level of the creek, constantly 346 

saturated in water (Fig. 2D). 347 



On the other hand, some shells exhibit very low uranium concentrations, and conversely are 348 

the ones with older ages. This pattern needs further investigation, but may indicate that these shells 349 

were reworked from older deposits or that there was some diagenetic alteration on these specimens, 350 

which interfered in the uranium uptake. Considering that the assemblage is composed mostly of 351 

shallow-living mollusks accumulated in the upper shoreface, with many specimens well-preserved, 352 

including small and fragile juveniles, it seems unlikely that the large age discrepancies represent 353 

time-averaging, because the shells would not have withstood the mechanical destruction for such a 354 

long time in this high-energy environment (Flessa and Kowalewski, 1994). Large time-averagings 355 

are expected to be found in transgressive lag deposits that are formed on the shelf during marine 356 

transgressions, as those found in the continental shelf today (Figueiredo, 1975) 357 

 The ages of the shells reinforce the interpretation that the marine facies of the Barrier II is 358 

older than 226- thousand years, based on a tooth from the overlying fossiliferous bed (Lopes et al., 359 

2010). Despite of the large ages difference of the shells, the results seem consistent with TL ages 360 

obtained for marine sediments collected about 1 meter above the shells (Lopes, unpublished data). 361 

Given the time interval indicated by the EU (~224 ± 24.6 ka BP) and the LU (~340 ± 31 ka BP) 362 

models, and that the EU ages are the youngest possible, these shall be considered younger than the 363 

„real? ages due to excessive U-uptake. An estimated age closer to ~234-238 ka BP, therefore within 364 

the error margin of the EU model, seems reasonable and also agrees with the interglacial peak of 365 

the marine isotope substage 7e, according to oxygen isotope curves for the Atlantic (Lisiecki and 366 

Raymo, 2009; Fig. 4). The interval between ~238 and 234 ka BP, within the substage 7e, is 367 

considered a hypsithermal, marked by warmer ocean temperatures than at present in the southern 368 

Atlantic (Robinson et al., 2002; Becquey &amp;amp; Gersonde, 2002; 2003). The shell assemblage from 369 

Chuí Creek also points to oceanographic conditions warmer than at present, indicated by the 370 

presence of the bivalves Anadara brasiliana, Anomalocardia brasiliana, Chione cancellata and C. 371 

paphia, which today are found living only in areas of the Brazilian coast to the north of Rio Grande 372 



do Sul state, and also by foraminifers found together with the shells (Lopes &amp;amp; Bonetti, 2012; Lopes 373 

et al., 2012).  374 

 Kanfoush et al. (2002) and Rainer and Gersonde (2002) reconstructed past oceanographic 375 

conditions from the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and concluded that the early phases of 376 

the last four interglacials were hypsithermals, characterized by higher temperatures in comparison 377 

to the present. Thus, the presence of warm-water bivalves in the coastal waters of southern Brazil 378 

around ~234-238 ka BP seems consistent with the hypsithermal recorded at the beginning of MIS 7 379 

(substage 7e). A hypsithermal was also identified during the late MIS 7 (substage 7a) around 200 380 

ka BP, which would fall within the lower error margin of the EU ages; nevertheless, one tooth of 381 

Notiomastodon from the continental shelf dated as of 207 ± 28 ka BP (Lopes et al., 2010) indicates 382 

that sea-level had already retreated around 200 ka BP. 383 

On the other hand, a LU age around ~340 ka BP would not be consistent with a sea-level 384 

highstand, considering that at this time sea-level was more than 120 meters below the present due 385 

to the glacial maximum of MIS 10 (Rohling et al., 1998). Nevertheless, an age closer to ~325 ka 386 

BP, within the lower error margin, would be consistent with the marine transgression of MIS 9. 387 

 388 

4.3 Stratigraphic implications 389 

The ages presented here increase the available ages for the deposits of the CPRS (Table 6), 390 

and help refine the sea-level curves for the coast of Rio Grande do Sul state presented by Lopes et 391 

al. (2010) (Fig. 6). Because of the scarcity of datable indicators of past sea-levels, mainly for the 392 

Pleistocene deposits, the exact timing of the sea-level highstands that formed the barrier-lagoon 393 

depositional systems have been mostly unknown. Based on the oxygen curves of Imbrie et al. 394 

(1984), Villwock and Tomazelli (1995) correlated the Barrier-Lagoon System II with the marine 395 

highstand of MIS 9, while the ages presented here suggest instead that the Barrier System II was 396 

formed by the marine transgression correlated to MIS 7. That leaves open the question of whether 397 



the oldest system (Barrier-Lagoon I) is correlated to MIS 9 or if it may represent an even older 398 

marine highstand.  399 

 The ~125 ka-old marine transgression that formed the Barrier System III, correlated to MIS 400 

5 and called Cananéia Transgression or Penultimate Transgression, is relatively well documented 401 

along the Brazilian coast (Bittencourt et al., 1983; Suguio et al., 1986), but deposits formed by 402 

older transgressions are scarce. In the northeastern Brazilian coast, several raised marine terraces of 403 

a unit called Barra de Tabatinga Formation have yielded TL and optical stimulated luminescence 404 

(OSL) ages of ~210-220 thousand years (Barreto et al., 2002; Suguio et al., 2011). The similar ages 405 

suggest that the Barrier System II and the Barra de Tabatinga Formation have been formed by the 406 

same transgressive event. The presence of chronocorrelated transgressive marine deposits in two 407 

distant areas (more than 3,000 km from each other) indicates that there are probably other similar 408 

deposits along the Brazilian coast that have not yet been identified due to lack of absolute datings.. 409 

  410 

5. CONCLUSIONS 411 

 The new ESR datings confirm a Late Pleistocene age for most of the mammalian remains 412 

found in Chuí Creek and their correlation with similar faunas found in deposits from Northern 413 

Uruguay and Western Rio Grande do Sul state. These new results help to put this assemblage in a 414 

more precise time interval, which should contribute to biostratigraphic correlations with other 415 

localities and for the assessment of the causes that led to the disappearance of the large mammals in 416 

the area. One hypothesis is that the progressive increase in aridity after ~34 ky BP, correlated to the 417 

LGM, may have played a role in their (pseudo)extinction. These ages will also help to reconstruct 418 

and understand the evolution of the terrestrial environments in the southern CPRS during the late 419 

Quaternary. 420 

 The mean EU age of ~224 ka obtained from the fossil shells seem to be in agreement with 421 

other unpublished datings and provide an estimate for the timing of the marine transgression that 422 



formed the Barrier System II. These results indicate a Late Middle Pleistocene age; considering 423 

that 224 ka is the youngest possible age, and that the younger shells are probably younger than the 424 

„real? age due to excessive Uranium uptake, an estimated age of ~234-238 ka BP for the shells 425 

seems closer to the „real? ages and would be consistent with the marine highstand during early MIS 426 

7 (substage 7e). This time interval was characterized by higher ocean temperatures, related to the 427 

hypsithermal phase at the beginning of the interglacial; such conditions are indicated by the 428 

presence in the fossil assemblage of bivalves that today live only in warmer areas to the north of 429 

Rio Grande do Sul state. Although the LU values suggest a mean age of 340 ± 31 ka BP for the 430 

shells, the higher reliability of the EU model and the correlation with other yet unpublished ages 431 

suggest that the EU values are closer to the real ages than the LU values.  432 

These results help to refine and improve the knowledge regarding the chronostratigraphy 433 

and sea-level variations for the Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state, showing that the 434 

maximum amplitude of the marine highstand that formed the Barrier System II was reached around 435 

230 ka BP. The ages also indicate chronological correlation of this depositional system with other 436 

marine deposits from northeastern Brazil. This correlation among two distant areas indicates that 437 

other depositional systems formed by this marine transgression are likely to be found in other parts 438 

of the Brazilian coast.. ESR datings on shells, in conjunction with other methods and datable 439 

materials, are a potential tool for refining the chronology of the middle to late Quaternary deposits 440 

along the Brazilian coast. 441

REFEREE 1: 
 
All the considerations were taken into account in the new version of the article. An introduction about the 
parametric and non-parametric models for Uranium uptake for ESR dating were included in the text as well 
as the rationale for use of parametric model, used in the absence of data from the U-series. All discussion 
of the chronology of the CPRS area respect the limitations imposed by the models and are described in the 
text. Unfortunately the in situ dosimetry site was not possible but we adjusted cosmic radiation dose rate 
through well established model described in the literature. Other text and typing corrections were also 
included. 

 
 
 
REFEREE 2: 

The discussion on shells must make clear what 'younger' means.  The phrasing should be something like 

"Calculated ages are probably younger than true ages due to uranium uptake" and should be repeated 

every time 'younger' appears.  However, there seems to be some inconsistency in interpretation here.   On 

the one hand, the authors insist that 224 ka can only be a minimum age, implying that there is little 

confidence in it.  The 'true' age could be 250 ka or it could be 550 ka. They cite an older tooth age as 

evidence that 224 ka is an underestimate.  Then they correlate 224 ka with a high seastand at 230 ka, 

implying that they do believe the EU values, although there is a nod to a possible earlier high seastand.  

Clearly there has been uptake of U since the fossil samples contain on average about five times the 

modern.  That does not tell us, unfortunately, whether it occurred early or more linearly.   It is also possible, 

of course, that the actual model is neither of these, something in between, perhaps.  Additionally, the 

M001 and M002 assemblages strongly suggest two populations, as the distribution of ages is not 

continuous (especially for M002).  Incidentally, the quoted averages for M001 and M003 are reversed in 

Table 5.  In the end, it seems as if the ages of the shells are deduced from the seastand rather than from 

the ESR measurements.  With respect to those, the correlation between uranium concentration and age is 

hardly surprising.  All samples have very similar AD's.  The internal dose is determined by the uranium 

concentration.  If the uranium concentration is high, the internal dose is high, and for the same AD you will 

get a younger age than you will get with a low uranium concentration. 

The best reason to believe that a ‘real’ age between ~235 and 240 is the result of two luminescence 

datings that provided ages of 235 ka (middle height of the exposed marine facies) and 214 ka (Aeolian 

sediments at the lower part of the terrestrial sequence). Unfortunately, these ages have not been 

published yet. Besides the age, the bivalves that indicate warmer oceanographic conditions are 

consistent with the hypsithermal recorded around 235-238 ka BP. 

 

The results for the teeth are much more consistent.  Here we note that the dentinal uranium concentration 

is very much higher than that in the enamel.   Most teeth show a difference of a factor of 10-20.  In fact the 

absolute amount of uranium in the dentine borders on dangerous exposures.  This is characteristic of fossils 

from a saline environment, such as these.  The issue then is whether 'normal' uptake models hold.  There 

are examples where recent uptake (RU) modeling gives ages in better agreement with other methods.  This 

is not to say that the actual model is RU.  Rather, apparently uranium concentration and mobility in saline 

environments may be considerably higher than in fresh water.  The authors might try RU modeling (with a 

relatively small p-value), not only because others have done so, but also because the quoted ages seem, 

*Detailed Response to Reviewers



again, younger than would be expected.  Lagoon III lies between Barriers II and III.  While there are no good 

ages for Barrier II except the shell ages in this manuscript, there are several ages for Barrier III that suggest 

the teeth in this study should exceed 85 ka in age.  This is not discussed in the manuscript, but should be.  If 

the explanation is that the teeth washed into the lagoon at a later date rather than when the lagoon was 

formed, then they do not date the lagoon.  If there is another explanation, what is it? 

In fact, the mammalian fossils are preserved in fluvial rather than lagoon facies. Stratigraphy shows 

different fluvial systems represented along the banks. We believe that most of the fossils should be 

younger than the ~125 ka-old Barrier III, because prior to the formation of this barrier, the fluvial systems 

flowed eastwards until discharging into the sea, thus many wouldn’t be preserved close to the area 

where the creek is located. The formation of the Barrier III created the conditions for preservation of all 

the fossils between the barriers.

ORIGINAL PAPER

Biostratigraphy of the Pleistocene Fossiliferous Deposits
of the Southern Brazilian Coastal Area

Renato Pereira Lopes

# Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011

Abstract Fossils of Pleistocene mammals have been
discovered in the southern Brazilian coastal area since the
late XIX century, in two main places: the continental shelf
and the Chuí Creek. Although the taxonomic composition
of fossil assemblages from these areas has been the focus of
most studies during the late XX century, research
concerning the ages, stratigraphic position, and biostratig-
raphy of such assemblages remains scarce. This is due to
the lack of suitable materials for age determination and the
reworked nature of the fossiliferous deposits in the
continental shelf. Only in recent years have new data shed
light on these subjects. Taxonomic revisions, ESR ages, and
biostratigraphic correlations confirm a late Pleistocene age
for the fossil assemblages, although those from the shelf
represent a significant time averaging, while fossils from
the Chuí Creek exhibit a narrower age range. The fossil
mammals found in southern Brazil represent a mixture of
Brazilian and Pampean taxa, including forms that disap-
peared much earlier from the Argentinean pampas. Gaining
an understanding of the biostratigraphic context of such
assemblages in comparison to similar assemblages from
Argentina and Uruguay, in conjunction with stratigraphic,
geomorphological, and paleoclimatic data should provide
additional tools with which to reconstruct the environmen-
tal and climatic dynamics of this portion of South America
during the late Pleistocene—early Holocene and its effects
on the fauna, and possibly to help address the problem of
the disappearance of megamammals in the area.

Introduction

Fossils of Pleistocene mammals were first reported from
southern Brazil (coastal area of Rio Grande do Sul state) in the
late XIX century, by the German naturalist Hermann Von
Ihering (Von Ihering 1891). The first discoveries consisted of
disarticulated, mostly fragmented specimens of extinct
megamammals found scattered along the beach after storms.
In the late 1960s, excavations for agricultural purposes
revealed a fossiliferous level in Chuí Creek, located some
14 km landwards of the coastline and containing essentially
the same extinct groups found in the marine deposits. During
most of the past century, these fossils have been the object of
several taxonomic studies (e.g., Cunha 1959; Paula Couto
and Cunha 1965; Oliveira 1992, 1996; Rodrigues and
Ferigolo 2004; Rodrigues et al. 2004; Scherer 2005; Marcon
2008), which led to a detailed understanding of the extinct
fauna that inhabited the area. Few studies were aimed at
understanding the stratigraphy, geology (Soliani 1973), and
biostratigraphy (Bombin 1975) of these fossil assemblages.
These studies, however, have been hampered by the lack of
suitable materials for age determination and the view of the
fossiliferous deposits of the continental shelf and Chuí Creek
as chrono-correlated lithostratigraphic units (Paula Couto
and Cunha 1965; Soliani 1973). Recent studies using new
dating methods, a new geological framework, and revision of
collections have led to updates of the nature, ages, faunal
composition, biostratigraphy, and taphonomy of the fossil
assemblages (Lopes et al. 2001, 2005, 2008, 2010; Pereira et
al. 2009; Aires et al. 2010; Lopes and Buchmann 2010;
Lopes and Pereira 2010a, b; Lopes et al. 2011; Pereira et al.

2011). New fossiliferous outcrops in the southern coastal
area of Rio Grande do Sul have also been identified, but
these are still in need of detailed studies (Lima and
Buchmann 2005; Lopes and Pereira 2010a, b).

Geological Setting

The best known fossiliferous deposits in the southernmost
portion of the Brazilian coast, the continental shelf and the
Chuí Creek area, are located in the area encompassed by the
Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul state (CPRS, Fig. 1).
The CPRS measures some 620 km in length and 100 km in

width; it is located between the latitudes 29°18?31?S and
33°43?17?S, and corresponds to the uppermost portion of
the Pelotas Basin that remains above sea level. This
marginal sedimentary basin has a maximum thickness of
10 km and was formed by the accumulation of sediments
eroded from Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks of the conti-
nental geological units after the split between South
America and Africa in the Late Cretaceous (Closs 1970;
Bueno et al. 2007; Barboza et al. 2008). During the
Quaternary, sea-level oscillations correlated to glacial
cycles reworked the uppermost sediments of the Pelotas
Basin, as evidenced by facies changes and microfossil
assemblages recovered from drilling holes (Closs 1970;
Carreño et al. 1999). As a result of these oscillations, two
major depositional systems were formed parallel to the
coastline: the Tertiary Alluvial Fans System and the
Quaternary Complex Multiple Barrier system (Villwock
1984; Villwock et al. 1986). The Complex Multiple Barrier
System is subdivided into four major barrier-lagoon
depositional systems and associated features. Each system
was formed in response to a major sea-level transgression
during interglacial episodes, and although the exact ages
have not yet been determined, they have been correlated to
the interglacial episodes at 400 ky (Barrier-Lagoon System I),
325 ky, (Barrier-Lagoon System II), 123 ky (Barrier-Lagoon
System III), and 6 ky (Barrier-Lagoon System IV) (Villwock
and Tomazelli 1995; Tomazelli et al. 2000). The sediments
that constitute these systems are essentially terrigenous
siliciclastic, well-sorted and mature, with small fractions of
organic matter, biogenic carbonate and diagenetic clays, with
some concentrations of heavy minerals (Villwock and
Tomazelli 1995).

Fossiliferous Deposits of the Continental Shelf

The southern Brazilian continental shelf has a low
topographic gradient (a 1:1.000 average ratio), with the
shelf break located at depths between 80 and 170 m. The
shelf is broad, contains submerged paleofluvial channels
and sand banks (Corrêa et al. 1996; Weschenfelder et al.
2008). During the Holocene sea-level transgression, around
6 ky BP, variations in the rates of sea-level rise resulted in
the reworking and concentration of terrigenous clastic
sediments of the shelf, and erosive terraces were formed
in response to episodes of sea-level stabilization (Kows-
mann and Costa 1974; Martins et al. 1996). Sediments that
constitute the upper portion of the shelf are nonmarine
clastics that originated from erosion of the older geo-
morphologic units, and were deposited by several fluvial
systems during the sea-level lowstands, including the La
Plata River (Tomazelli 1978; Martins 1983).

The fossils of megamammals are found in two distinct
areas of the shelf: the inner shelf (from the surf zone up to

depths of 10 m, roughly the zone affected by wave action),
and the outer shelf (at depths of 20 m and more, where the
action of waves does not reach the ocean bottom, as
indicated by extensive bioincrustation in vertebrate remains
collected in deeper areas of the shelf; Lopes and Buchmann
2010). Although the presence of fossils of terrestrial
mammals has been recorded all along the coastline of Rio
Grande do Sul, such fossils are more conspicuous in the
southernmost portion (Buchmann 1994). These are found
associated with large concentrations of fossil marine shells
and other marine organisms on the inner continental shelf
(Figueiredo 1975). During autumn and winter, storm waves
erode these deposits, removing the fossils and throwing
them onto the beach, forming large konzentrat-lagerstätte
called “Concheiros” (Buchmann et al. 2009; Fig. 2).
Virtually all knowledge about the fossils from the shelf is
based on those from the inner shelf, collected along the
beach; fossils from the outer shelf are scarce and only
recently have been described in the literature (Lopes and
Buchmann 2010). The presence of terrestrial mammalian
elements in deeper areas of the shelf, several kilometers far
from the present coastline, does indicate that the fossilifer-
ous area of the shelf is much larger than previously
imagined.

The fossils of terrestrial mammals found in the shelf
comprise extinct and extant taxa. Fossils found scattered
along the beach are mostly fragmented and much abraded,
but sometimes complete specimens can be found (Lopes et
al. 2008). The fossils from the outer shelf are incomplete,
but lack signs of abrasion, and are partially covered by

encrusting and boring organisms. The available data
indicate that the mammalian fossils found in the shelf
come from ancient fossiliferous deposits formed on areas
of the shelf that remained above sea level during marine
regressions and were subsequently eroded and exposed to
marine environments by sea-level transgressions; this
process occurred several times during the Quaternary, in
response to glacial-interglacial episodes (Lopes and
Buchmann 2010).

Chuí Creek

The Chuí Creek is a fluvial system located some 14 km
landwards of the present coastline. It flows parallel to the
coastline for most of its course, and its southernmost part
marks the boundary between Brazil and Uruguay. The
fossiliferous layer was exposed in the late 1960s, when the
creek was further excavated for agricultural purposes. The
first mention of these fossils was presented by Paula Couto
and Cunha (1965); later, Soliani (1973) described the
stratigraphy of the Chuí Creek, correlating the fossiliferous
level to a new lithostratigraphic unit that he proposed and
named “Santa Vitória Formation,” presumably representing
an ancient lagoon environment. Following the revisions of
the geology of the CPRS during the 1980s and 1990s, the
lithostratigraphic scheme was abandoned and replaced by
the concept of depositional systems. Under this new
scheme, the Chuí Creek flows over a large plain associated
with the Lagoon III System, positioned between two
Pleistocene barriers: the ~325 ka Barrier II located land-
wards and the ~123 ka Barrier III. Additionally, new
geological surveys and taphonomic analysis on the remains
indicate that the fossils were preserved in a meandering
fluvial system instead of a lagoon (Lopes et al. 2001, 2005).

The stratigraphic sequence exposed above the creek bed
measures some 4.5 meters (Fig. 3). The basal layer is
composed of well-sorted, fine sand and represents a marine
environment developed during a Pleistocene sea-level
transgression (Buchmann et al. 2001; Lopes 2010). This
layer is correlated to the “Chuí Formation” (Delaney 1965;
Soliani 1973) and contains galleries of calianassid crusta-
ceans (ichnofossils Ophiomorpha nodosa), fossils of
shallow-living mollusks, and parallel and crossed stratifi-
cations (Fig. 4a, b), indicating a shallow marine environ-
ment. The layer above represents continental environments
and is composed of fine sand and exhibits an upwards
increase in silt-sized sediments. Paleosols with root traces
and dark sand lenses are visible at the base of this layer
(Fig. 4c); the latter are interpreted as oxbow lakes formed
by abandoned fluvial meanders (Lopes et al. 2005). This
layer also contains fossils of large terrestrial mammals,
preserved and re-worked in a paleo-fluvial system (Fig. 3).
This layer also bears a ~40 cm-thick horizon of caliche

the center, an osteoderm of Glyptodon

nodules and rhizoliths (the “Caliche Cordão” of Delaney
1965) and vegetal remains in the form of rhizoliths and root
traces (Fig. 4d). The caliche level is not continuous, and its
longest exposure measured so far is some 460 m in length;
until now, no fossils have been recovered from this horizon.
The mammalian remains are mostly disarticulated and
fragmented due to fluvial dynamics, but sometimes com-
plete and even articulated remains can be found, indicating
that this is a parautochtonous assemblage. Although most
of the specimens found in the fossiliferous layer exposed
along Chuí Creek comprise the same taxa found on the
continental shelf, there are some differences and the former
represent a narrower time span, according to recent age
determinations (see below).

Stratigraphic Position of the Fossils

The exact biostratigraphic context of the fossil mammalian
assemblages from southern Brazil was subject to some
misconceptions, due to the reworked nature of the speci-
mens found along the coast, to geological interpretations,
the lack of materials suitable for dating techniques, and lack

of information on the exact taxonomic composition of the
fossil assemblages. In the first systematic geological
mapping of the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Delaney
(1965) attributed a Tertiary age to the fossils found along
the beach and correlated them to deposits of the “Graxaim
Formation” (now recognized as the Alluvial Fans Systems)
that presumably extended in the subsurface from the
continent to the continental shelf. Paula Couto and Cunha
(1965) challenged this assumption because no vertebrate
fossil was ever recovered from the “Graxaim Formation.”
The major problem with the stratigraphic origin of the
fossils from the continental shelf is the fact that these
specimens are all removed from their original context. The
coastal area of Rio Grande do Sul has been subject to
erosive processes (Esteves et al. 2002; Dillenburg et al.
2004), which are removing the Holocene sediment cover
and exposing the underlying Pleistocene substrate and
fossils along the coast. Additionally, the four major sea-
level transgressions that are recorded in Rio Grande do Sul

also contributed to the erosion of the deposits now located
on the continental shelf; Dillenburg (1994) estimated that
each transgression would erode at least 10 m of the
sedimentary cover, thus exposing and mixing together
fossils of different ages. This assumption is corroborated
by the large age span observed among the fossils from the
shelf (see below).

The Chuí Creek so far represents the best fossiliferous
area of the CPRS in terms of stratigraphic relations. The
fossils are found in the ~1.5 m-thick layer just above the
marine facies. The fossils are mostly fragmented and
disarticulated, but complete and even articulated remains
can be also found, suggesting that this level represents a
fluvial facies, which is reinforced by the presence of some
organic matter-rich sand lenses that seem to represent
oxbow lakes formed by abandoned channels in a meander-
ing fluvial system. Many fossil specimens can be found
removed from the fossiliferous layer due to erosion of the
banks, but those found in situ seem to occur all in the same
level, except for a much older upper incisor of a Toxodon
sp., found in the stratigraphic level below the fossiliferous
layer, and one dentary of a vizcacha (Lagostomus sp.;
Kerber et al. 2010), found above the fossiliferous level. The
presence of a caliche layer (Fig. 3) above the fossiliferous
level does indicate a drier climate period, which probably
affected the distribution of the large mammals in the area.
The uppermost portion of the sequence, representing the
Holocene, is a dark, carbon-rich muddy sand, marked by
the presence of specimens of Blastocerus dichotomus,
Myocastor coypus, Caiman latirostris, and fishes, indicat-
ing a humid environment (wetland), plus several “cerritos,”
low mounds built by paleoindians and containing archae-
ological artifacts (Schmitz et al. 1997).

In his description of the stratigraphy of Chuí Creek,
Soliani (1973) considered that the fossils from the creek
and those from the continental shelf came from coeval
lagoon facies of the “Santa Vitória Formation,” after the
interpretations of Paula Couto and Cunha (1965). Follow-
ing the re-interpretations of the regional geology proposed
during the 1980s (e.g., Villwock 1984; Villwock et al.
1986), the lithostratigraphic scheme was abandoned in
favor of a chronostratigraphic framework that recognizes
the geomorphological units of the CPRS as depositional
systems formed at distinct times. Under this framework, the
fossiliferous layer containing vertebrates exposed along the
banks of Chuí Creek is now correlated with the fluvial
facies of Lagoon System III, younger than most of the
fossils from the continental shelf. Thus, the new data
obtained by geological surveys and ages of fossils from the
Chuí Creek and continental shelf indicated that these
deposits constitute distinct units, and led to a better
understanding of the stratigraphy of this portion of the
coastal plain (Fig. 5).

Ages

The only previous ages reported in the literature for the
fossils of CPRS are found in Soliani (1973), who
estimated an age of 15,000 years for the material from
Chuí Creek, and Bombin and Klamt (1976), who
mentioned ages of 7,000 and 9,000 years for specimens
found in “lacustrine deposits below recent soils,” without
any additional details. As an attempt to establish conclu-
sive ages, several fossil teeth (seven from the continental
shelf and four from Chuí Creek) were selected for dating
using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). The results
revealed that the mammalian fossils from the shelf
represent a large time range (Table 1), with their ages
coinciding with marine isotope stages (MIS) 16, 12, 8, 6, 4
and 2, and indicating that the organisms occupied the area
during periods of sea-level regressions related to glacial
maxima (Lopes et al. 2010).

The ages obtained so far for specimens from the
fossiliferous level in Chuí Creek represent a narrower time
span, except for the incisor of Toxodon (Table 1) found in a
stratigraphic level below, which probably represents the
transition from marine to continental environments. Chro-
nologically, the fossiliferous fluvial facies exposed along
Chuí Creek is correlated to the Luján, Tezanos Pinto,
Arroyo Feliciano and Toropí formations of Argentina
(Kröhling 1999; Zurita and Lutz 2002; Zurita et al. 2007;
Ferrero and Noriega 2009; Tonni 2009) and the Touro
Passo Formation of western Rio Grande do Sul, which
bears fossils with ages ranging between 34 and 19 thousand
years at least (Kerber et al. in press).

Faunal Composition of the Assemblages

Another problem regarding the biostratigraphy of the fossil
assemblages from the coastal area of Rio Grande do Sul is
related to its faunal content. Throughout the years, several
taxa such as Equus, Hippidion, Ozotocerus, Smilodon,
Blastocerus, Antifer, Tayassu, Macrauchenia, Megathe-
rium, Hydrochoerus, and Tapirus have been cited as
occurring in Chuí Creek (e.g., Oliveira et al. 2005; Oliveira
and Pereira 2009), although no report or formal description
has been presented in the literature. The problem seems to
date back to the work by Paula Couto and Cunha (1965),
which presented a taxonomic list of fossils collected both
on the beach and the Chuí Creek, without specifying what
came from each deposit. Their original taxonomic list was
accepted and cited by different authors, who added new
taxa but didn’t review the original specimens. The reason
why Paula Couto and Cunha did not specify the exact
provenance of the fossils was probably because they
considered that Chuí Creek and the fossiliferous deposits

in the continental shelf were part of the same lithostrati-
graphic unit, the “Santa Vitória Formation.” The fossils
collected by those authors were taken to the paleontological
collection of Museu Nacional, in Rio de Janeiro, and a
recent survey of the collection revealed that none of the

specimens from Chuí Creek included the taxa mentioned
above. Nevertheless, specimens of Antifer, Macrauchenia,
Equus, Hippidion, and Smilodon have been recently
described from this location (Lopes and Pereira 2009;
Scherer et al. 2009; Pereira et al. 2009; Aires et al. 2010).

The most common taxa from the continental shelf
assemblage are glyptodonts, represented mostly by isolated
osteoderms, followed by cervids, toxodontids, ground
sloths, pampatheriids, and equids. Until now, carnivorans,
tayassuids, and tapirids are known from only a few
specimens. In Chuí Creek, glyptodonts, Toxodon, and
Stegomastodon are the most common, while cervids,
equids, and dasypodids are scarce. The only confirmed
record of Camelidae is a molar attributed to Hemi-
auchenia described by Oliveira (1992). In both assemb-
lages the most abundant taxa are those adapted to open
environments, while remains of camelids, carnivorans,
and rodents are rare. The last seems mostly absent
probably due to taphonomic processes (Lopes et al.
2008), while carnivorans were a group with low specific
richness in South America (Prevosti and Vizcaíno 2006);
thus their low proportion in the samples is expected. The
differences in abundance among the two assemblages are
probably the result of the large time-averaging observed
among the remains from the continental shelf, but can
also include environmental and/or climatic conditions
(see below).

Among the specimens from the continental shelf,
there are few problematic taxa, such as a Toxodontidae
indet. (Cunha 1959) and a Haplodontheriinae indet.
(Oliveira 1992), represented by a fragmentary femur and
tooth, respectively. Given the wide time span encom-
passed by material found on the shelf, it is possible that
the Toxodontidae indet. may represent another species of
Toxodon, because several Bonaeran and Ensenadan spe-
cies are known from Argentina (Bond 1999). The
haplodonteriine toxodontids seem to have become extinct
during the Pliocene; thus their record in younger sedi-
ments of southern Brazil is problematic and needs to be
revised. The presence of Megatherium in both assemb-
lages is also debatable. Throughout the years, several
fragmentary specimens of megatheriids have been
regarded as belonging to this genus, but lacked precise
descriptions or comparisons. Until now, the only mega-
theriid formally recognized among the material from Chuí
Creek is Eremotherium, represented by a dentary of a
juvenile (Pereira et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the co-
occurrence of Eremotherium and Megatherium cannot be
discarded, because both taxa have been found in the same
deposit, located in the central area of Rio Grande do Sul
(Toledo 1986; Oliveira 1999).

Some remarkable taxa found in the continental shelf
include Pachyarmatherium (Ribeiro et al. 2008; Bostelmann
2008) and Neolicaphrium (Scherer et al. 2009). The former
is a Plio-Pleistocene taxon found until recently only in
northeastern Brazil, Venezuela, and southeastern USA, and
the latter is a taxon that disappeared in the Pampean Region
of Argentina during the late Pliocene, but has also been

found in the Pleistocene Sopas Formation of northeastern
Uruguay (Bond et al. 2001). In Table 2 an updated list is
presented of taxa known so far from the continental shelf and
Chuí Creek.

Biostratigraphy

In their review of the mammalian fossils from the CPRS,
Paula Couto and Cunha (1965) correlated the fossils to the
“Pampeano Superior” (Bonaerean) of Argentina, according
to the biostratigraphic scale of Ameghino. Bombin (1975),
based on the presence of fossils of Equus (Amerhippus)
neogaeus, correlated the fossil mammals of Rio Grande do
Sul to the Lujanian “Land-Mammal Age” of the Pampean
Region of Argentina, following the biostratigraphic scheme
proposed by Pascual et al. (1966), and this has been
accepted throughout the years. Pascual et al. (1966)
proposed a homogenous distribution for this Pampean
fauna, encompassing southern Brazil, Uruguay, and
Argentina; however, recent fossil records have shown
that this concept is incorrect (Noriega et al. 2004; Carlini
et al. 2004; Ubilla 2004). The concept of South American
Land-Mammal Ages (SALMAs) has been changed
throughout the years, with several revisions and corrections,
reflecting new fossil finds, and the instability of this
concept. More recently, Cione and Tonni (1995, 1999)
proposed the replacement of the concept of SALMAs by
the more stable biostratigraphically-based chronostrati-
graphic Stage/Age scheme, defining the Lujanian Stage/
Age as the biozone of Equus (Amerhippus) neogaeus,
encompassing the time interval between 130 and 8.5 ka AP.
Following this new scheme, the ages obtained so far for
remains from the fossiliferous layer in Chuí Creek confirm
a Lujanian Stage/Age, while the older Toxodon tooth is
Bonaeran. Among the specimens from the shelf, however,
the ESR ages indicate that they encompass not only the
Lujanian, but also the Ensenadan and Bonaeran Stage/Ages
(Lopes et al. 2010; Fig. 6).

The presence of Antifer in Chuí Creek (Lopes and
Pereira 2009) is also significant, because in the Pampean
region, this taxon is restricted to the Ensenadan (A.
ensenadensis) and Bonaeran (A. ultra) (Cione and Tonni
1999; Cione et al. 1999), but fossils of this genus have been
found in Lujanian deposits of northern Chile (Quebrada
Quereo Formation, Labarca and López 2006), Mesopota-
mian region of Argentina (Toropí Formation, Alcaraz and
Zurita 2004), Uruguay (Sopas Formation, Ubilla 2004), and
western Rio Grande do Sul (Touro Passo Formation, Kerber
and Oliveira 2008). Although common among fossils from
the shelf (Scherer et al. 2007), specimens of Antifer cannot
be conclusively regarded as Lujanian, due to the large time-
averaging of this deposit.

The faunal shifts observed in the region located between
southern Brazil, northern Argentina, northern Uruguay, and

the Argentinean Pampas seems to be correlated to climatic
variations and resulting environmental changes that affected
this area during the Quaternary. Several researchers have
pointed to the similarities between the faunas from Rio
Grande do Sul and those from northwestern Uruguay and
the Mesopotamian region of Argentina (Carlini et al. 2004;
Noriega et al. 2004; Oliveira and Kerber 2009; Oliveira and
Pereira 2009; Tonni 2009; Ubilla et al. 2009). The taxa
found in the fossil assemblages of CPRS include mostly
Pampean forms, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts,
Toxodon, Antifer, and Morenelaphus, but also include
Brazilian taxa such as Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris and
Tapirus (in the continental shelf), Protocyon troglodytes
and Eremotherium laurillardi (in Chuí Creek), and Catonyx
cuvieri, Holmesina paulacoutoi, and Pampatherium typum
in both assemblages (Table 3). The faunal content of these
assemblages includes mostly large-bodied taxa, presumably
adapted to open environments (grasslands) (Oliveira 1999).

Good correlation between the faunal content and
paleoclimate/paleoenvironment can be observed in the
vertical faunal and sedimentological variations found in

Fig. 6 Stage/Ages and corresponding biozones recognized for the
Quaternary of South America, according to Tonni (2009), and ages of
the mammalian remains from RSCP according to Lopes et al. (2010)

the Luján Formation of Argentina (Prado and Alberdi 1999;
Tonni et al. 1999). The lowermost La Chumbiada Member
indicates a temperate climate around 30 ka AP, while the
Guerrero Member above was formed under cold and arid
climates correlated to the LGM (between ~21 and 10 ka AP,
Tonni et al. 2003), and there is a definite faunal turnover
between both units. A similar variation seems to be
recorded in the stratigraphic sequence exposed along Chuí
Creek: the fossiliferous layer is a muddy sandstone
deposited in fluvial environments that exhibits an upward
gradual increase in silt-sized sediments and the disappear-
ance of large-bodied taxa. This sequence suggests a humid
environment at the base of the sequence, represented by the
reworked mammalian fossils and organic matter-rich sand

lenses, progressively replaced by a drier environment,
represented by the caliche level above and the increase in
silt, probably reflecting the deposition of wind-blown loess
from periglacial areas of the Andes under progressively
semiarid conditions, as suggested by Soliani (1973). The
ages obtained for the fossils from this layer suggest that the
humid interval took place between 30 and 40 ka AP. This
interval could also have been warmer, which would enable
the incursion of the Brazilian (intertropical) taxa. Until now
the only fossil recovered from an upper level is a dentary of
Lagostomus (Kerber et al. 2010), a rodent that may be
associated with arid environments. Other fossil indicators of
arid environments found in Chuí Creek are Microcavia
(Ubilla et al. 2008) and Dolichotinae (Pereira et al. 2009).
Unfortunately, the material cannot be assigned to a
particular stratigraphic level, because the former was
collected without exact determination of its stratigraphic
position, and the latter was collected in sediments dredged
from the creek.

The sea-level lowstands correlated with glacial advances
probably influenced the distribution of the mammalian
fauna as well, by affecting the regional climate regimes due
to increased continentality. While in Chuí Creek and the
continental shelf the record of camelids is scarce, in Touro
Passo Formation, located some 500 km landwards, camel-
ids are common fossils (Ribeiro and Scherer 2009) and
specimens of Catagonus have also been found in this unit
(Gasparini et al. 2009). The former is adapted to drier
and colder climate, thus is considered good environ-
mental indicators (Scherer 2005), and Catagonus is
associated with semiarid environments. It seems probable
that during sea-level regressions the westernmost Rio
Grande do Sul, northwestern Uruguay, Mesopotamian,
and western Pampean areas have experienced drier
climates, with increased seasonality, while the CPRS
would have milder climates due to its proximity to
Atlantic Ocean, despite the fact that the coastline was
located some 100 km eastwards in relation to the present.
It seems that temperature was not a major factor affecting
the faunal dynamics in southern Brazil, northern Uruguay,
and the Mesopotamian region, because several taxa, such
as glyptodontids, pampatherids, ground sloths, toxodon-
tids, macraucheniids, and mastodonts, have a wide
latitudinal distribution, reaching even equatorial areas.
Instead, it seems that humidity played a major role in this
pattern, by affecting the distribution of vegetation that was
the food source for these organisms, but additional studies
are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.

In both the continental shelf and Chuí Creek, the fossil
assemblages contain disharmonious or non-analogs faunal
elements sensu Lundelius (1989), such as taxa adapted to
arid environments (Dolichotinae, Microcavia, Lagostomus,
Catagonus) together with taxa adapted to humid environ-

ments (Hydrochoerus, Myocastor), a pattern similar to that
observed in the fossil assemblage of the Sopas Formation
(Ubilla 2004; Ubilla et al. 2004). An explanation for this
pattern could be the existence in the Pleistocene of climatic
regimes without analogs today, which would allow the
coexistence of such different taxa. Nevertheless, other
causes may be responsible for this pattern in the fossil
assemblages of CPRS. In the case of the continental shelf,
this mixture may be a result of the large time interval
represented by the fossils, which include material from
several different assemblages developed through time under
different climatic conditions. In Chuí Creek, which spans a
narrower time interval, there are three possible scenarios to
explain this faunal mixture:

1) The fluvial system was active during some ten
thousand years, as indicated by the ages of the fossils
(Lopes et al. 2010); thus, the presence of both Brazilian
and Pampean taxa may represent either a true mixture
of both faunas during this interval or the gradual
replacement of one by the other, but the reworking of
the older deposits by the fluvial dynamics prevents the
identification of this stratigraphic succession.

2) During a humid and/or warmer interval after 33 ka
BP, the Brazilian taxa migrated to the south, and the
fluvial system reworked older deposits, mixing the
specimens of the Brazilian fauna with the older
Pampean taxa.

3) The climatic regime that allowed the entrance of the
Brazilian fauna occurred before 42 ka BP, and was
replaced by a colder/humid climate that led to the
retreat of this fauna and the readvance of the Pampean
one. Fluvial dynamics between 42 and ~30 ka BP
reworked and deposited together the remains of both
faunas.

The mixture of both Pampean (temperate to cold) and
Brazilian (intertropical) taxa suggests a northwards-
southwards migration of climatic belts, related to glacial
cycles. According to Rabassa et al. (2005), during glacial
maxima the Pampean fauna would migrate farther to the
north, following the northward displacement of the climatic
belt, while Brazilian fauna would migrate southwards
during interglacials, reaching the Pampean region. It can
be difficult to evaluate this pattern on fossil assemblages,
due to erosion and reworking of the sediments, and ages of
the sediments using TL/OSL might be inconclusive due to
the possibility of older fossils being re-deposited on
younger sediments. Ages obtained on the fossils them-
selves, however, using 14C or ESR, can provide direct
correlation between the ages of the remains and paleocli-
matic patterns recorded on sediments and palynomorph
assemblages.

In southeastern Brazil, several studies have shown that
the interval between ~45 and ~25 ka AP was marked by
cold and/or humid climates, followed by drier ones in some
areas until the beginning of the Holocene (Ledru 1993;
Ledru et al. 1996; Behling and Lichte 1997; Salgado-
Laboriau 1997; Turcq et al. 1997), a pattern that seems to
be represented in the geological and fossil records of Chuí
Creek, as evidenced by ESR ages of the fossils and the co-
occurrence of taxa indicative of distinct environmental
conditions. These data, correlated with the ages obtained in
the fossils from Chuí Creek, seem to corroborate the
statement by Oliveira (1999) proposing a cold and humid
environment in this area during the late Pleistocene, based
on the presence of Mylodon darwini, Holmesina paulacou-
toi, and Stegomastodon waringi. However, southern Brazil
was also probably influenced by drier climatic conditions
seen in Uruguay and Pampean region, because during
glacial maxima the colder/drier Patagonian climatic belt
would have been displaced up to 750 km northeastern of its
present position (Iriondo 1999; Behling 2002), thus reach-
ing southernmost Brazil, resulting in vegetation changes,
loess deposition and faunal migration. These conflicting
climatic influences were most probably the main factor
responsible for the faunal mixture of Pampean and
Brazilian taxa found at this latitude.

Final Remarks

While both fossil assemblages from the southern Brazilian
coastal area contain specimens of terrestrial mammals
correlated to Lujanian Stage/Age, the assemblage from the
continental shelf also contain fossils chronologically
correlated to older Stage/Ages (Ensenadan and Bonaeran).
In Chuí Creek, however, the fauna found in the
fossiliferous level is Lujanian, encompassing an interval
of some ten thousand years, between 42 and 33 ka BP.
Nevertheless, older specimens have also been found, but
in other stratigraphic levels. While there seems to be a
correlation between the stratigraphic position of the fauna
from Chuí Creek and the progressively drier climate of
latest Pleistocene, this has yet to be compared with
additional data in order to confirm or deny this
correlation.

These data support the biostratigraphic correlation of this
fossil assemblage with other localities in southern Brazil,
Uruguay, and Argentina. Such a correlation can improve
the understanding about the latest Pleistocene faunal
dynamics, its distribution, extinction, and relation to
climatic variations, when combined with geomorphological,
sedimentological and palynological data.

The information presented here is a synthesis of the
current knowledge regarding the biostratigraphy of the

fossil assemblages from the CPRS. The ongoing research
on the Chuí Creek should provide further information on
the subject, in addition to increasing our knowledge of the
stratigraphy, geologic evolution, paleoclimate, chronology
and faunal dynamics in southern Brazil during the latest
Pleistocene-early Holocene.

Stable isotopes (?13C, ?18O) in teeth of extinct mammals have been used as indicators of diets and climate
conditions, which in turn are used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The first analysis of stable isotopes
in Pleistocene mammals from Southern Brazil is reported here. The analyzed taxa were the notoungulate
Toxodon and the proboscidean Stegomastodon from Late Middle to Late Pleistocene fossiliferous beds exposed
along Chuí Creek, in the coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul State. The ?13C isotopes indicate that Toxodon was a
mixed-feeder that fed mostly on C4 plants, while Stegomastodon was a browser to mixed-feeder with
preference for C3 plants, with less C4 plants in the diet compared to modern African elephants. Comparison
with carbon isotopic values in fossils of these taxa from other Late Quaternary localities in South America
shows an increased proportion of C3 plants in the diets of both Toxodon and Stegomastodon in higher latitudes.
The values of ?18O in both taxa seem to reflect the isotopic composition of the ingested water rather than the
isotopic content in the plants of which they fed on, and the observed variations are likely to mirror variations
of the patterns of precipitation. Paleoclimatic inferences and possible causes for the (pseudo)extinction of
these taxa in southern Brazil are also discussed.

1. Introduction

The Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul State (CPRS), in southern
Brazil, contains fossiliferous assemblages of Pleistocene age. The
most important and studied is the one found in Chuí Creek (Fig. 1).
The fossil assemblage is found in a sedimentary layer exposed along
the banks of the creek, and includes mostly large-bodied extinct
mammals correlated to the Lujanian Stage/Age from the Pampean
region of Argentina (e.g. Paula Couto and Cunha, 1965; Soliani, 1973;
Lopes et al., 2009). This assemblage is a mixture of Pampean taxa
(e.g. Doedicurus sp., Lestodon armatus and Mylodon darwinii) and taxa
with Brazilian affinities (Eremotherium laurillardi, Protocyon troglodytes,
Holmesina paulacoutoi). Besides these, there are taxa indicative of
humid (Myocastor coypus, Holochilus brasiliensis) and dry/semiarid en-
vironments (Dolichotinae sp.; Microcavia sp., Catagonus stenocephalus)
(Oliveira et al., 2005; Ubilla et al., 2008; Kerber et al., 2011; Lopes,

in press). The taphonomy of the fossils indicates that the assemblage
is parautochthonous, composed of remains reworked and mixed by
fluvial dynamics (Lopes et al., 2009). ESR ages obtained from fossil
teeth show that the fossil assemblage from the Chuí Creek encompasses
a time interval between Late Middle (~226 ka BP) and Late (~34 ka BP)
Pleistocene at least (Lopes et al., 2010).

The mixing of organisms related to different environments, the
large time interval represented by this assemblage, and the reworking
by fluvial dynamics, indicate that paleoenvironmental reconstructions
based solely on the faunal composition of the fossil assemblage can be
difficult (Lopes, in press). The climate of the South America during the
Middle to Late Pleistocene was highly variable, driven by Milankovitch
cycles and millennial-scale oscillations (Clapperton, 1993; Salgado-
Laboriau et al., 1998; Rabassa et al., 2005; Whitney et al., 2011).
Such variation is likely to have influenced the range of habitats and
the distribution (and possible the extinctions) of large terrestrial
mammals, but paleoenvironmental data from southern Brazil are
so far based on pollen records (Behling and Lichte, 1997; Behling,
2002) and speleothems (Cruz et al., 2005, 2006; Wang et al., 2007).
The results of the first analyses of stable isotopes in fossil mammals
from Chuí Creek, as an attempt to understand their paleoecology and
make inferences about the climate and environments in southern
Brazil during the Late Middle to Late Pleistocene are presented here.

2. Geological setting

Chuí Creek is a small fluvial system located in the coastal area
of southernmost Brazil, near the town of Santa Vitória do Palmar
(Fig. 1). It flows over a plain located some 11 m above sea level,
between two Pleistocene coastal barriers (Fig. 2), each one formed
by a marine highstand during interglacial epochs (Villwock and
Tomazelli, 1995). The creek was originally a shallow stream, but in
the early 1960s it was further excavated for agricultural purposes,
exposing a layer containing fossils of Pleistocene mammals (Paula
Couto and Cunha, 1965). The fossiliferous layer overlies shallow
marine sediments and is composed of muddy sand, with organic
matter-rich sand lenses that contain palynomorphs indicative of len-
tic environments, interpreted as oxbow lakes formed by abandoned
meanders, an interpretation reinforced by the taphonomic features
observed on the fossils (Lopes et al., 2009).

All fossils found so far have been collected from the lower portion
of the ~1 m-thick muddy sand layer; its uppermost portion exhibits an
~40 cm-thick discontinuous horizon of caliche nodules and rhizoliths,
and it is overlain by an ~1.0 m-thick silty sand layer that seems to
represent loessic deposition, suggesting a drier climate regime. No
vertebrate fossils have been recovered so far from the silty sand, but
plant roots and some possible burrows made by small vertebrates
are found. The uppermost portion of the sequence is composed of

organic matter-rich clay and sand that also contains archeological
remains.

Although fossils of different ages come from the same stratigraphic
interval, due to fluvial reworking, the association of different faunal
elements such as indicators of humid and dry environments, and
also taxa with Pampean and Brazilian (intertropical) affinities indi-
cates that southern Brazil (together with northern Uruguay and the
Mesopotamian region of Argentina) was under the influence of differ-
ent climate and environmental conditions between the Pleistocene
and Holocene (Lopes, in press).

3. Methods

In recent years, stable isotopes in organic remains have been used as
tools for paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in
continental environments of the Paleogene and Neogene (Koch et al.,
1995; MacFadden and Cerling, 1996; MacFadden et al., 1996; Koch,
1998; Kohn and Cerling, 2002; Palmqvist et al., 2003). Among terrestrial
mammals, the main object of the studies has been tooth enamel, that
has a mineral phase composed of hydroxylapatite (Ca10[PO4, CO3]6
[OH, CO3]2) and records dietary and environmental informations in
the form of carbon and oxygen isotopes in the phosphate (PO4

3?)
and carbonate (CO3) components. Several studies have demonstrated

that isotopic values from enamel carbonate can be preserved with
minimal or no significant diagenetic alteration (Wang and Cerling,
1994; Bocherens et al., 1996; Cerling et al., 1997; Sánchez et al., 2004).

The isotopic abundances are expressed in parts permil (‰), using
the notation ?:

? ¼ RSample=RStandard
? ?

?1
h i

? 1000

where R is the ratio between the heavier and the lighter isotope (13C/12C;
18O/16O) and represents deviations in the isotopic ratio in relation to a
standard. The standard used for carbonate is Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite
(VPDB), while oxygen values are usually compared to the Standard
Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). More positive values of ? indicate enrich-
ment of the heavier isotope in relation to the lighter one.

The oxygen isotopic ratios in enamel are derived from the isotopic
content of ingested water (18Ow), either by drinking or from food,
which in turn is related to climatic conditions such as mean annual
temperature (MAT) and local precipitation (Dansgaard, 1964; Fricke
et al., 1998). Another factor that influences the ?18O content of organ-
isms is the loss of body water through transpiration, respiration and
excretion (Luz and Kolodny, 1985). Large mammals obtain most of
their water by drinking, thus are more reliable paleoclimatic indica-
tors (Bryant and Froelich, 1995; Fricke and O'Neil, 1996).

The carbon isotopic content (?13C) in herbivores' tooth enamel
indicates preference for plants that use C3 or C4 photosynthetic path-
ways, thus it can be used as tools for reconstructing the diet, which
can indicate in what type of environment the animals lived (De Niro
and Epstein, 1978; Ehleringer et al., 1997; MacFadden, et al., 1999).
The plants that use C3 photosynthetic pathway (dicotyledonous such as
trees, shrubs, herbs and cool growing season grasses) exhibit ?13C values
between ?22‰ and ?35‰ (mean=?27‰), while those that use C4
pathway (monocotyledonous such as warm growing season grasses
and CAM plants) exhibit ?13C values between ?19‰ and ?9‰
(mean=?13‰) (Koch, 1998). In large herbivore mammals (body
mass?100 kg), the ?13C values are between 12 and 14‰ more positive
in relation to the plants they eat, because of fractioning conditioned by
stable body temperature of 37 °C (Cerling and Harris, 1999; Palmqvist
et al., 2003; MacFadden, 2005). The 13C values among different species,
however, can differ by values up to ~5‰ because of different physiologies
and metabolic rates (Passey et al., 2005). Herbivores that eat only C3
plants will exhibit mean ?13C values of ~?13‰, while those feeding
on C4 plants only will exhibit mean values of +1‰. Herbivores that
eat both C3 and C4 plants (mixed feeders) will exhibit intermediate
?13C values.

Sixteen fossil teeth from Chuí Creek were selected among speci-
mens from the paleontological collection of Universidade Federal
do Rio Grande (FURG). All remains have been collected in the fossilif-
erous layer exposed on the banks of Chuí Creek in the last 10 years.
The selected taxa were two common elements of the Pleistocene
megafauna found in Chuí Creek, the toxodont Toxodon (ten speci-
mens) and the mastodont Stegomastodon (six specimens). Because
the teeth of Toxodon are euhypsodont and all specimens were frag-
ments, there was no preferential portion of the teeth for enamel
extraction; in Stegomastodon the teeth are brachydont, so the enamel
was extracted from the lingual or labial side of the crown. Besides, the
teeth of the latter have a thick enamel layer, so provide more material
for the analyses.

The chosen specimens did not have carbonate or iron crusts, and
were mostly teeth fragments. Between 0.4 and 2.3 g of enamel from
each specimen were mechanically drilled and manually powdered.
The enamel samples were then treated with 2% NaOCl during three
days under local temperature for the removal of any organic contam-
inants, and treated with 0.1 M acetic for one day to remove any diage-
netic carbonates and bicarbonates (Koch et al., 1997). The samples
were then treated with 85% H3PO4 at 25 °C for 3 days to release the

CO2 (McCrea, 1950). The ?
13C and ?18O values were measured on

cryogenically cleaned CO2, according to the method described by
Craig (1957) in a double inlet, triple collector mass spectrometer
(VG Isotech SIRA II) at NEG-LABISE, Universidade de Pernambuco,
Brazil. The C and O isotopic data are presented as standard ‰ deviation
with reference to the standards VPDB and SMOW for ?13C and ?18O,
respectively. The statistical analysis of the results consisted of normal-
ity test (Kolmogorov–Smirnov), t-test and coefficient of variation fol-
lowing Zar (1999) and were performed using the software Bioestat
5.0. Estimates of percentages of C4 plants in diet were calculated fol-
lowing Koch et al. (1998).

4. Results

4.1. Carbon isotopes

The results of the 13C and 18O analyses of both taxa, with the ages of
the dated specimens (Lopes et al., 2010; unpublished data) are listed in
Table 1. Isotopic data from African elephants (Loxodonta africana) from
Bocherens et al. (1996) are also presented for comparison.

Nine samples of Toxodon exhibit ?13C values between ?4.0‰
and ?5.5‰, except for one sample (LGP-E0011) that exhibits value
of ?8.8‰; the standard score (z) shows that it is an outlier (Hair et
al., 2005). The mean value of ?13C (excluding the outlier) is ?4.6‰
(s=0.554). These values indicate a mixed diet, with predominance
of C4 plants (between 53 and 64% excluding the outlier, Fig. 3) and
are similar to those obtained by MacFadden (2005) for fossils of
Toxodon from northern Argentina, which exhibit ?13C values between
?1.5 and ?7.2‰.

The teeth of Stegomastodon provided ?13C values between ?7.3‰
and ?10.2‰ (mean=?8.5‰, s=0.934), indicating browsing to
mixed feeding habit with predominance of C3 plants in the diet
(with 20 to 40% of C4 plants, Fig. 3). Five teeth exhibit values between
~?7‰ and ?8‰; although one specimen (LGP-G0002) exhibits
value of ?10.2‰, comparable to values found in extinct Stegomastodon
from the late Pleistocene of the Pampean region of Argentina (Sánchez

1996) shown here are ~1.5‰ more depleted after correction for the Suess effect.

et al., 2004) and values found in modern African elephants (Table 1)
(Bocherens et al., 1996; Cerling et al., 1999). Although the independent
t-test shows that the carbon values of Stegomastodon do not differ
statistically from those found in L. africana (p&gt;0.05), analysis of the
coefficient of variation shows that the latter exhibits a wider range of
?13C values (30.9%) in comparison to Stegomastodon (11.2%).

4.2. Oxygen isotopes

The values of ?18O for Toxodon teeth range between 31.0‰ and
28.5‰ (mean=29.9‰, s=0.80); while in Stegomastodon range from
27.9‰ to 29.6‰ (mean=29.1‰, s=0.78). Although direct comparison
between different regions may be hampered by variable hydrologic
conditions, ?18O values for Toxodon are similar to those observed in
fossils from northeastern Brazil, Bolivia (Chaco), northern Argentina
and Buenos Aires Province of Argentina (MacFadden, 2005). The values
obtained for Stegomastodon are similar to those found in teeth of
modern L. africana from Amboseli Park (Bocherens et al., 1996) and
Stegomastodon from Argentina and northeastern Brazil (Sánchez et al.,
2004).

The correlation between ?18O and ?13C in both taxa is weak (Fig. 4),
indicating that the isotopic content of the plants that these animals fed
on didn't contribute for the isotopic composition of their body water.

5. Discussion

5.1. Carbon isotopes

The ?13C values obtained for both taxa indicate a browsing to
mixed-feeding habit based mostly on C3 plants for Stegomastodon,
and indicate a mixed diet for Toxodon, composed of C3 and C4 plants
(Fig. 5). The values obtained for Stegomastodon are very close to those
found in modern African elephants, but the higher coefficient of var-
iation seen in the latter indicates a wider range of dietary preferences
that include large amounts of C4 plants, related to the seasonal feed-
ing pattern. Most of their diet is composed of C3 plants, but during a
few weeks after the beginning of the rainy season, up to 60% of their
diet includes C4 grasses (Cerling et al., 2004), while in Asian ele-
phants (Elephas maximus) the amount of C4 grasses in the diet during
the rainy season can reach up to 90% (Sukumar and Ramesh, 1992).
The ?13C values in Stegomastodon from southern Brazil indicate that
their diet included a lower proportion of C4 plants in comparison.

The values found in Toxodon teeth clearly indicate the presence of
both C3 and C4 plants in its diet (Fig. 5). The value of ?8.8‰ found in
the specimen E0011, lower than in the other specimens, suggests that
it had a higher proportion of C3 plants in its diet (about 70%); similar
values have been found in Toxodon from the Buenos Aires Province,

Argentina (MacFadden et al., 1996; MacFadden, 2005). It is possible
that this individual had migrated from an area with a different pat-
tern of vegetation, or it inhabited the region during a time when the
vegetation pattern was different. Another possible explanation is
that this specimen may represent a young individual that was still
feeding mostly on mother's milk. Studies have demonstrated that
sucklings may exhibit a 3–4‰ depletion of 13C values in comparison
to adults as a result of the carbon isotopic content of the milk (Witt
and Ayliffe, 2001).

C4 plants are less digestible and exhibit lower proteic values in
comparison to C3 plants (Ehleringer et al., 2002), thus the high con-
tent of C4 plants in the diet of Toxodon from southern Brazil may be
one cause of the widespread occurrence of enamel hypoplasy in the
form of pits and sulci in the teeth of this taxon, that indicates a path-
ological condition related to nutritional stress (Ferigolo, 2007; Braunn
et al., 2011).

5.2. Oxygen isotopes

The range of variation of the ?18O values of Stegomastodon and
Toxodon are 2.2 and 2.9‰, respectively (Fig. 6). In African elephants
from Amboseli the range of variation is similar; because the migratory
habits of elephants (in some cases reaching some 500 km) result in
differences of up to 1‰ in ?18O (Ayliffe et al., 1992), only migrations
cannot account for such variation. Although an important part of the
diet of modern elephants consists of C4 grasses, that are enriched in
18O due to evaporation, the oxygen content of their body water mir-
rors the isotopic composition of the meteoric (local) water, because
they obtain at least 1/3 of their ingested water from parts of C3 plants
(stems, twigs and fruits) that are 18O-depleted in comparison to
leaves. Besides, trees and shrubs that constitute most of the C3 diet
of elephants also have deeper roots that reach less-enriched under-
ground water, while C4 grasses have shallow roots and can only ab-
sorb the surface, 18O-enriched water (Kohn et al., 1996; Sponheimer
and Lee-Thorp, 1999). If this pattern was similar for Stegomastodon,
then the variations in oxygen values may be explained by different
isotopic compositions of the ingested water. The relatively large
variation of ?18O values of L. africana (Fig. 6) is likely to represent
seasonal variations of local precipitation, possibly enhanced by the
migration of these animals in search of other water sources during
dry seasons.

Grazers tend to exhibit higher ?18O values compared to browsers
and mixed-feeders because of the enriched 18O content of C4 grasses
in comparison to C3 plants, probably related to anatomical differ-
ences (Helliker and Ehleringer, 2000), thus, the higher 18O content
of the teeth of Toxodon could be related to the ingestion of C4 grasses.
Nevertheless, as in Stegomastodon, there is poor correlation between
the diet and oxygen content of body water (Fig. 4), suggesting that
Toxodon also obtained most of its water from drinking rather than
from food. Because there is no overlapping among the ages of the
dated specimens, then the variations found in the oxygen values
of Toxodon teeth (mostly enriched in comparison to Stegomastodon)
probably reflect variations in the isotopic composition of meteoric
water through time. Because of the incompleteness of the teeth, the
possibility that such variations could reflect seasonal patterns of pre-
cipitation (causing different parts along the tooth to exhibit distinct
?18O values) was not addressed here, but may be explored in the
future.

It has been proposed that Toxodon had a semiaquatic lifestyle
similar to that of hippopotamuses, based mostly on its skull morphol-
ogy (Darwin, 1839; Paula Couto, 1979; Anderson, 1984). In modern
African hippos, the ?18O values are lower in comparison to other
large herbivores living in the same area. This pattern seems to be
related to the semiaquatic habit of these animals that causes the
depletion of the ?18O content of body water by preventing the loss
of water by transpiration (Cerling et al., 2008; Clementz et al., 2008).

If Toxodon was also a semiaquatic animal, it would be expected to
find average low ?18O values, similar as to those found for hippos.
The values reported by Bocherens et al. (1996) for hippos from
Amboseli Park, however, are about 2.9‰ lower (mean=26.9‰) in
comparison to elephants living in the same area. The ?18O values in
Toxodon teeth are in fact more enriched than those found in hippos
and do not differ much than those found in Stegomastodon. Thus, the
oxygen isotopes in Toxodon do not seem to support a semiaquatic
habit. A similar conclusion was reached by analysis of the postcranial
anatomy of Toxodon (Shockey, 2001).

5.3. Comparison with other localities

Late Pleistocene toxodontid remains are found from Central America
to Argentina. The only valid genus of this group recognized for the
Pleistocene of Southern South America is Toxodon (Bond, 1999).
MacFadden (2005) analyzed teeth of Toxodon from several localities
of South America and found a large variation in ?13C values, showing
that this taxon was a generalist, feeding on both C3 and C4 plants,
according to the available type of vegetation that existed in the
area. The overall variation of ?13C values in fossils from Chuí Creek
(excluding the outlier E0011) is smaller in comparison with values
from other localities (Fig. 7a), and are similar to those found in Toxodon

Creek and modern Loxodonta africana (from Bocherens et al., 1996).

from northern Argentina (MacFadden, 2005). The latitudinal distribu-
tion of the ?13C values in Late Quaternary fossils of Toxodon shows a
clear southwards increase in C3 vegetation in the diet, except for the
specimens from the Amazon basin and Toca dos Ossos (NE Brazil),
which had a lower proportion of C4 plants on their diet (MacFadden,
2005). The variation in ?18O values, however, do not show a clear
pattern, probably because the oxygen content is dependent of several
external factors such as the ?18O content of the ingested water, temper-
ature and local precipitation.

Gomphotheriidae proboscideans were widespread in South America
during the Middle to Late Pleistocene and remains of Stegomastodon
have been found from Colombia to the Pampean region of Argentina
(Prado et al., 2005; Alberdi et al., 2007). Similarly to the pattern ob-
served in Toxodon, carbon isotope analyses revealed a latitudinal pat-
tern of dietary preferences: while specimens from lower latitudes had
a higher content of C4 plants (including an exclusive C4 grazer from
northern Argentina), those living in latitudes south of ~30° S had a
greater proportion of C3 plants in their diet (Sánchez et al., 2004;
Alberdi et al., 2008; Asevedo et al., 2012), a pattern reinforced by the
present study (Fig. 7b). Except for specimens from Ecuador and north-
ern Argentina, which had a higher proportion of C4 plants on their
diet, specimens from Chuí Creek had ?13C more similar to those found
in northeastern Brazil and the Buenos Aires Province, all very close to
values found in modern L. africana.

The oxygen isotopic values do not exhibit a latitudinal pattern
as seen in carbon isotopes; mean ?18O values from Chuí Creek are
close to all other localities of South America, except for Ecuador and
northern Argentina. In comparison with Toxodon, the oxygen values
for Stegmastodon remains from South America seem to exhibit much

less range of variation; no fossils of this taxon exhibit ?18O values
lower than ~28‰ (Fig. 7b).

5.4. Paleoclimatic and paleoecological implications

Toxodon is a taxon with widespread records in South America, and
is considered a generalist herbivore adaptable to a wide range of diets
(MacFadden, 2005), so it seems reasonable to consider that the ?13C
values reported here are reliable indicators of the type of vegetation
that existed in the CPRS during the interval represented by the fossils
(Late Middle to Late Pleistocene). The available palynological surveys
show that the landscape during the Late Pleistocene–Early Holocene
of Rio Grande do Sul State consisted of grasslands (“campos”) with
gallery forests, dominated by Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Asteraceae, but also
included Caesalipiniaceae, Papilionaceae and Verbenaceae (Behling et
al., 2004). It seems likely that the diet of Toxodon consisted of C4 grasses
and C3 herbs, while Stegomastodon fed mostly on C3 herbs and shrubs
(and possibly trees) but included also C4 grass in their diet.

The small range of variation of 1.54‰ in the composition of the
carbon values of Toxodon teeth (excluding the outlier E0011 men-
tioned before), indicates that these animals had very strict feeding
habits, regarding the relative proportion of C3 and C4 plants in the
diet. Among the four dated specimens (E0038, E0040, E0053 and
MOT0050) the total range of variation is of 0.5‰, indicating that
their feeding habit didn't change much through time, despite of the
large (~180 thousand years) of difference between the oldest and
youngest dated specimens. Such a specialized diet may indicate that
Toxodon inhabited southern Brazil during times of stable environmental
conditions, without drastic changes that could affect the composition

of the vegetation assemblages. Another possible explanation could be
the competition with other large herbivores such as glyptodonts and
ground sloths, considered grazers and browsers, respectively (Vizcaíno
et al., 2006), that were common in the Late Pleistocene of South America.
This competition could also explain why horses are relatively scarce in
the fossil deposits of Chuí Creek.

Despite of the small number of analyzed samples, the variation
of 2.8‰ in the carbon values of Stegomastodon teeth suggests that it
had a more generalistic feeding habit, based on C3 plants but also
including between 20 and 40% of C4 plants. The lack of specimens
of the same age do not allow to infer whether the inclusion of C4
plants reflects a possible seasonal feeding pattern, as seen in modern
elephants, or if it represents different diet habits related to changes in
the composition of the plant assemblages through time. Nevertheless,
the dated specimens (G0001, G0036 and G0037) exhibit a range of
variation of only 0.3‰.

The time interval represented by the dated specimens (except for
MOT0050) encompasses the glacial interval corresponding to marine
isotope stages (MIS) 4 (71–60 ky BP) and MIS 3 (60–24 ka BP; Table 1).
This interval, mainly MIS 3, was marked by several millennial-scale
oscillations, related to climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere
and recorded in geological records from other areas of southern Brazil
(Cruz et al., 2005, 2006; Wang et al., 2007). Considering that there is
no overlapping in ages between the dated specimens of Toxodon and
Stegomastodon, it is possible that the distinct dietary patterns and
oxygen values deduced from the isotopic composition of the two taxa
may reflect distinct environmental conditions, related to the climatic
oscillations within the last glacial period.

The oxygen values in hydroxyapatite of obligatory drinkers are
correlated to those from ingested water (?18Ow), which in turn
depends on local climatic conditions, thus can be used as proxies for
isotopic values in paleoprecipitation (Dansgaard, 1964; Longinelli,
1984). Such a relationship is well-established for modern elephants
(Ayliffe et al., 1992; Koch, 1998; Kohn and Cerling, 2002). Because
the oxygen isotopic content of Stegomastodon appears to be inde-
pendent of the diet as in elephants, it probably mirrors the isotopic
composition of the local waters. The 18Ow for Stegomastodon was
calculated using the relationship between the oxygen content of the
PO4 component of bioapatite (?

18Op) and ingested water in modern
elephants (Ayliffe et al., 1992):

?18Op ¼ 0:9?18Ow þ 23:3:

The carbonate in enamel is ~8.7‰ more enriched in ?18O than
phosphate and both are in isotopic equilibrium in mammalian enamel
(Bryant et al., 1996). The isotopic values from enamel carbonate
obtained here (?18Oc) were first converted to phosphate values
(?18Op) by reducing the ?18Oc values by 8.7‰. The ?18Ow results
(Table 2) varied between ?4.5‰ and ?2.1‰ (mean=?3.0‰).
The Lagoon System III where Chuí Creek is located is isolated by the
Barrier II (see Fig. 2) from other water bodies such as large rivers
and lakes located landwards, thus local precipitation was the only

source of water that formed the rivers and possible small lakes from
where the mammals drank.

In medium and low latitudes there is no correlation between the latter
and local temperatures, but good correlation between precipitation and
oxygen isotopic composition of meteoric waters (Dansgaard, 1964;
Rozanski et al., 1992; Bowen and Revenaugh, 2003). In southern Brazil
today there is a good positive correlation between ?18O in precipitation
and the amount of precipitation (Fig. 8). This pattern is related to the
extratropical origin of rain during the wet seasons (Winter and Spring),
that brings 18O-enriched precipitation; during Summer and Autumn
there is less precipitation and the rain is 18O-depleted because of its dis-
tant tropical (Amazonian) origin related to southwards migration of the
South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) when the intertropical con-
vergence zone (ITCZ) is located closer to the equator (Gan et al., 2004;
Cruz et al., 2005).

If the 18Ow calculated from Stegomastodon represents the isotopic
content of meteoric water, and the relationship between oxygen in
precipitation and the amount of precipitation seen today is valid for
the past, then the ~2.2‰ drop in ?18O between the oldest specimen
(G0036) and the youngest (G0001) indicates a change in precipitation
(from extratropical to monsoonal) and possibly a reduction in the
amount of precipitation in Southern Brazil. The small range of variation
in the isotopic values of oxygen seen in specimens of Stegomastodon
from several localities of the continent suggests that these animals re-
quired very specific environmental conditions, at least regarding the
amount of available water, and a drastic reduction in the water supply
may have been detrimental. Despite of the small number of available
isotopic data from northern areas of South America, it seems that
Stegomastodon did not inhabit areas with low precipitation, as would
have been indicated if these had ?18O-depleted values (Fig. 7b). In
Southeastern Brazil, a population of mastodonts died apparently as re-
sult of a dry period some 55 thousand years ago (Avilla et al., in press).

If we consider the relationship between oxygen isotopes and pre-
cipitation, it seems likely that the specimens with enriched ?18O
values (G0036 and G0037) lived during periods of increased precipi-
tation, while the most depleted in ?18O (G0001) indicate drier inter-
val. Although it is not possible to estimate precisely the values of
?18Ow from Toxodon remains, because its physiology is not known
and there are no living relatives from which to establish a basis for
comparison, the enrichment or depletion in 18O may as well indicate
changes in the isotopic content of meteoric water ingested by those
animals. The specimens E0038 and E0053, ~2 ky older and younger,
respectively, than G0001, exhibit comparatively more enriched ?18O

values, suggesting periods of increased precipitation of extratropical
origin.

Behling et al. (2004) described pollen records from the highlands
of Rio Grande do Sul state (some 600 km to the north of Chuí Creek)
and concluded that climate was wetter between ~43 and ~27 ky BP in
comparison with the last glacial maximum (LGM). During this inter-
val the pollen records show high-frequency, small random changes
in vegetation, indicating relatively stable climate conditions. This rel-
ative stability seems compatible with the conservative dietary pattern
of Toxodon, inferred from carbon isotopes. On the other hand, the
seemingly conservative diet habit of this taxon suggests that it may
have been very sensitive to drastic changes in vegetation, although
not much affected by variations between dry and wet conditions, as
suggested by the high variations in ?18O seen in specimens from several
localities (Fig. 7a).

The main driver of changes in the composition of plant assemblages
during the Late Pleistocene seems to have been moisture, because after
~27 ky BP there was a reduction of the arboreal vegetation and pre-
dominance of grasses, indicating drier conditions (Behling et al., 2004).
The changes in moisture were probably related to the increased latitudi-
nal displacement of the polar front, enhanced by the increased con-
tinentality due to the sea-level lowstand (some 130 m below present
sea-level (Lopes and Buchmann, 2010)). In fact, several studies have
shown the northwards displacement of the “campos” vegetation,
reaching as far as 750 km from their present distribution (Ledru et al.,
1996; Behling and Lichte, 1997; Salgado-Laboriau, 1997; Behling, 2002).

In Chuí Creek, the large mammals are so far absent from the upper
stratigraphic levels, which also record an increase in silt-sized parti-
cles probably of loessic origin (Lopes et al., 2011), suggesting drier
conditions; this is reinforced by the presence in the fossil assemblage
of taxa that indicate semiarid environments, such as Catagonus cf.
stenocephalus, Dolichotis sp., Lagostomus maximus and Microcavia sp.
(Oliveira et al., 2005; Ubilla et al., 2008; Kerber et al., 2011; Pereira
et al., 2012; Lopes, in press). This dryness is probably correlated to
the LGM, and the corresponding environmental stress may have
resulted in dramatic changes in the composition of the vegetation,
and consequently upon the large mammals communities.

Oliveira (1999) proposed that the fauna from the Chuí Creek
represented cold and dry grassland environment. Although the data
presented here and faunal composition of the fossil assemblage
corroborate the open environment interpretation, the isotopic data
and the recent findings of intertropical taxa, indicate that dry periods
were intercalated with more humid phases. Millenial-scale climatic
oscillations, in time scales of 1 to 7 thousand years, have been
recorded in deep sea and ice cores, and were most prominent during
glacial intervals (Siddall et al., 2005). The ESR ages obtained from
fossil teeth indicate that most of the remains encompass the time in-
terval corresponding to MIS 3 (between 60 and 24 ky BP), which was
marked by several millennial-scale oscillations. The changes in the
pattern of precipitation in scales of 2 thousand years are compatible
with the high-frequency and high-amplitude climatic oscillations
during the last glacial phase, which were probably a major factor
behind the disappearance (pseudoextinction) of these large-bodied
herbivores from southern Brazil.

6. Conclusions

• The ?13C values presented here indicate that Stegomastodon was
a browser to mixed feeder, with a high content of C3 plants in its
diet, while Toxodon was a mixed feeder that fed mostly on C4
plants, probably grasses, and had a very specific dietary composi-
tion regarding the proportion o C3/C4 plants in Southern Brazil.

• The ?13C values in Stegomastodon are similar to those found in modern
L. africana, but the lower coefficient of variation found in ?13C values of
Stegomastodon indicate that it was mostly a C3 feeder, with lower
proportion of C4 plants in its diet than L. africana.

• The distinct carbon values from both taxa suggest that an open
grassland environment with patches of trees and shrubs occupied
the coastal plain of Southern Brazil between the Late Middle to
Late Pleistocene.

• The carbon content in fossils of Stegomastodon and Toxodon rein-
forces the existence of a latitudinal variation in their diet, with
specimens from lower latitudes consuming more C4 plants than
those from higher latitudes.

• In both taxa there is no correlation between the carbon and oxygen
content, thus indicating that the ?18O values mirror the oxygen com-
position of the ingested water, rather than the isotopic content of
ingested plants.

• The ?18O values obtained for Toxodon are more enriched than those
found in living and fossil hippopotamuses and thus do not seem to
support the similar semiaquatic habit that has been attributed to it.

• The very conservative diet preferences of Toxodon, indicated by the
low variability in ?13C values, suggest that this taxon may have
been very sensitive to drastic changes in the composition of the
local vegetation.

• If the relationship between ?18O in precipitation and the amount of
precipitation in mid- to low latitudes of South America is valid for
the past, then the low variability in ?18O values of Stegomastodon
could indicate that these animals required a constant water supply,
while Toxodon also could have inhabited dry/semiarid environments.

Here is presented a preliminary report of an ongoing research on the deposits of the 
Lagoon System III found in the Santa Vitória do Palmar county, in southernmost Rio Grande 
do Sul state. This contribution includes new paleoenvironmental and paleontological data that 
provide further information regarding the evolution of this unit. The southernmost portion of 
the Brazilian coast comprises the Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul State (RSCP). This 620 
km-long geomorphological unit had its morphology influenced by glacioeustatic oscillations 
during the Neogene and Quaternary. Between late Pleistocene and Holocene, sea-level 
transgressions originated four major barrier-lagoon depositional systems parallell to the 
coastline. The transgressive event of 123 ka AP formed the Barrier-Lagoon System III, which 
is well represented along the entire RSCP (Tomazelli &amp;amp; Dillenburg, 2007). In the southern 
sector of RSCP, the Lagoon System III, located between Barrier III and the older Barrier II, is 
well preserved, and the facies associated to this system are exposed along the banks of Chuí 
Creek (Fig. 1A). The creek flows in a NE-SW direction, parallel to the coastline, but near the 
town of Chuí its course changes to NW-SE before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean. 

Chuí Creek was originally a shallow creek flowing through the plain between 
Pleistocene barriers II and III. During the late 1960s, it was further excavated for agriculture 
purposes and during the excavations the underlying sedimentary facies were exposed, 
revealing marine sediments and continental sediments containing fossils of Pleistocene 
mammals (Figure 1B). The first stratigraphic study on Chuí Creek was made by Soliani Jr. 
(1973), who correlated the marine deposits at the base of the stratigraphic sequence to the 
“Chuí Formation” of Delaney (1965), and the overlying fossiliferous layer to a new 
lithostratigraphic unit that he named “Santa Vitória Formation”. During the 1980s the 
lithostratigraphic scheme of the RSCP was abandoned in favour of the concept of depositional 
systems, replacing the lithostratigraphic units by chronocorrelated stratigraphic units. Under 
this new scheme, both the marine and continental deposits are now correlated to the Lagoon 
System III.

Marine facies 

Today the banks of Chuí Creek measure some 4,5 meters in height above the creek 
bed (Figure 1C). The lowermost 2 meters of the sequence is the marine facies correlated to 
the “Chuí Formation”. The total thickness of this layer is still unknown, but manual drillings 
revealed that it is more than 4 meters. Ichnofossils Ophiomorpha nodosa are common 
throughout this facies (Figure 1D); the sediment is a fine yellow sand, exhibiting parallel and 
low-angle cross stratifications (Figure 2A). Recently, an accumulation of marine mollusks 
was identified at the base of the exposed portion of this facies, with abundant remains of 
sandy bottom dwellers such as Amiantis purpurata, Pitar rostrata and Mactra isabelleana 
(Lopes, 2010). It is noteworthy that above this accumulation Ophiomorpha galleries are found 
but no shells have been observed yet.  
 
Fluvial facies 

The transition between the marine facies and the overlying layer is gradual (Figure 
2B). The latter is the fossiliferous unit that Soliani Jr. named “Santa Vitória Formation” and 
interpreted as deposited in a lagoon environment. However, the taphonomic features of the 
vertebrate fossils, mostly unidentified fragments but also including articulated remains, and 
the presence of dark sand lenses interpreted as oxbow lakes, indicate a meandering fluvial 
environment. These lenses are massive and measure between 20 and 30 centimeters in 
thickness and 3 to 7 meters in length (Figure 2C); the top and bottom exhibit iron oxide 
crusts. The lenses protrude into the marine facies below and may contain small fragments of 
vertebrate fossils. Adjacent to these lenses paleosols with abundant root traces can be 
observed (Figure 2D).  

Until now, vertebrate fossils were found only on the lower portion of the fluvial facies, 
in a ~1m-thick level. ESR datings on fossil teeth found in this layer revealed ages between 42 
and 33 thousand years (Lopes et al., 2010). No sedimentary structures have been observed in 
this facies. Above the fossiliferous layer only root traces have been recorded, but at some 
points along the banks a carbonate layer can be found, which was named “Caliche Cordão” by 
Delaney (1965) (Figure 2E). It measures some 40 cm in thickness, and although its 
distribution is not homogeneous, its longest continuous exposition is 461 meters in length. 
The carbonate forms irregular nodules and rhizocretions. 

The sediment that constitutes the fluvial facies is composed mainly by fine sand, but 
there is an upwards increase in silt-sized particles. Although no vertebrate fossils have been 
recovered so far from the upper portions of this facies, some structures that suggest burrows 
made by micromammals were recently found (Figure 2F). The uppermost portion of the 
sequence is formed by a ~70 cm-thick layer of organic matter-rich fine clayey sand, which 
contains archaeological artifacts and vertebrate remains indicative of a Holocene wetland 
environment.

DISCUSSION 

The sedimentary sequence exposed along the banks of Chuí Creek shows the transition 
between a shallow marine environment to a continental one. Although detailed regional 
stratigraphic data are not available yet, the present data suggest that the marine facies may be 
correlated to the Barrier System II, formed by the marine transgression estimated to have 
occurred around 325 ka AP, by correlation with the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 9 by 
Villwock &amp;amp; Tomazelli (1995), but it may also represent the transgression of 200 ka BP, 
correlated to MIS 7. One tooth of an extinct mammal found in the same level of the marine 
facies and dated on 226 ka BP (Lopes et al., 2010), suggests that the transgression may have 
occurred at 200 ka BP and reworked older continental deposits. Until datings for the 
sediments and large-scale, detailed stratigraphic surveys are available, the exact age of this 
depositional system is still debatable. Anyway, the stratigraphic sequence indicates that after 
the marine transgression that formed the Barrier II, sea-level retreated and continental 
sediments started to accumulate on top of the marine facies. During the interval before the 
marine transgression of 123 ka BP, that formed the Barrier System III seawards of Barrier II, 
all drainage presumably would flow eastwards to the ocean. Seismic surveys on the 
continental shelf have shown the existence of several fluvial paleochannels with an E-W 
orientation that were correlated to fluvial systems that existed during sea-level lowstands. 
Thus, during the interval between 325 or 200 ka AP and 123 ka BP, Chuí Creek on its present 
NE-SW orientation wasn’t established yet. After the 123 ka BP transgression, drainage 
coming from the surrounding higher areas of Barriers II and III would have flown to Lagoon 
System III, increasing the sedimentation. Although Soliani Jr. (1973) and other authors 
considered the sediments above the marine facies were deposited in lagoon environment, no 
evidence of such lagoon have been found yet. The dark, organic matter-rich sand lenses 
contain palynomorphs that suggest the existence of shallow lentic environments, such as the 
margins of a lake or lagoon or oxbow lakes. Because this dark sand layer is not continuous 
along the banks, the correlation with oxbow lakes, formed by abandoned channels in a 
meandering fluvial system, seems more plausible. The presence of mostly fragmented 
remains of fossil mammals, with clear indication of post-fossilization reworking, reinforces 
the existence of a fluvial system (Lopes, 2009). 

It’s not clear yet whether this fluvial system was continuously active after the 
formation of Barrier-Lagoon System III. The only available ages obtained so far from three 
fossil mammal teeth revealed ages of 42, 38 and 33 ka BP, which suggest an active fluvial 
system around 30 ka BP. However, additional ages should probably reveal the existence of 
older fossils and fluvial sediments. The ages between 42 and 33 thousand years are correlated 
to a more humid climatic phase that has been recorded in other parts of central-southern 
Brazil (Ledru, 1993) and Argentina (Prado &amp;amp; Alberdi, 1999), coincident with the milder 
climate of MIS 3. The fossil record of the aquatic rodent Myocastor coypus on this layer 
indicates the presence of a stable water body (Pereira et al., 2009). The vertebrate fossils are 
concentrated on the ~1 meter-thick basal portion of the fluvial facies, and the apparent 
absence of such remains on the upper portion may be related to climatic and environmental

changes, as recorded in the Luján Formation of the Pampean Region of Argentina (Tonni et 
al., 1999). The deposition of the caliche layer and the upwards increase in silt-sized sediments 
seem to be result of an increasingly drier climate and deposition of finer, probably loessic 
sediment, correlated to the climate deterioration that led to the last glacial maximum (LGM) 
during  MIS 2. During the LGM the dry (Patagonian) climatic belt was displaced some 750 
km NE of its present position, as indicated by loessic deposits in Uruguay (Iriondo, 1999) and 
probably southern Rio Grande do Sul. The presence in Chuí Creek of fossil mammals that 
indicate drier environments such as Catagonus stenocephalus, Dolichotis sp. and Microcavia 
sp. (Pereira et al., 2009) also reinforces a drier climatic phase. The Pleistocene-Holocene 
transition in the study area is represented by the dark clayey sand layer on top of the 
sequence. The increase in organic matter, plus the vertebrate remains and archaeological 
evidence found in this layer indicate a more humid environment that allowed the development 
of wetlands in the area. The excavation of Chuí Creek, in the 1960s, changed this 
environmental condition, favoring the drainage of the wetlands for agriculture purposes

CHINCHILLIDAE AND DOLICHOTINAE RODENTS (RODENTIA:
HYSTRICOGNATHI: CAVIOMORPHA) FROM THE LATE PLEISTOCENE OF

SOUTHERN BRAZIL

ABSTRACT –  New records of rodents from the late Pleistocene Chuí Creek, Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil, are
here described. A partial dentary with fragmented cheek teeth is identified as Chinchillidae, Lagostomus Brookes cf. L.
maximus (Desmarest). Other two specimens are identified as cheek teeth of Dolichotinae indet. (Caviidae). Pleistocene
fossils of Lagostomus were previously reported for Argentina and Uruguay. The material of Lagostomus from Chuí Creek
represents the first confidently record of this taxon Brazil. Pleistocene fossil remains of Dolichotinae have been found in
Argentina, Uruguay and other areas of southern Brazil, though the Brazilian find lack precise stratigraphic information.
These new records widen the paleobiogeographic distribution of Lagostomus and confirm the presence of Dolichotinae
during the late Pleistocene of southern Brazil.

Key words: Lagostomus, Lagostominae, Dolichotinae, Chuí Creek, Rio Grande do Sul, Quaternary.

RESUMO – Este trabalho reporta novos materiais de roedores provenientes dos depósitos fossilíferos do arroio Chuí (Rio
Grande do Sul, sul do Brasil). O material de Chinchillidae é identificado como Lagostomus Brookes cf. L. maximus
(Desmarest) e é representado por um dentário esquerdo faltando sua região posterior, com o incisivo preservado e a série
p4-m3 fragmentada. Os outros dois espécimes são identificados como molariformes de Dolichotinae indet. (Caviidae). Os
fósseis de Lagostomus durante o Pleistoceno estavam restritos a Argentina e Uruguai. O material aqui reportado caracteriza
o primeiro registro seguro deste táxon no Brasil. Fósseis de Dolichotinae têm sido encontrados em depósitos pleistocênicos
da Argentina, Uruguai e sul do Brasil, porém este último provém de uma localidade sem contexto estratigráfico preciso.
Desta forma, estes novos registros ampliam a distribuição paleobiogeográfica de Lagostomus e confirmam a presença de
Dolichotinae durante o Pleistoceno final do sul do Brasil.

INTRODUCTION

Chinchillidae are South American hystricognath rodents
that include the extant chinchillas (Chinchilla Bennett, 1829),

mountain vizcachas (Lagidium Meyen, 1833) and pampas
vizcachas (Lagostomus Brookes, 1828). The stratigraphic
distribution of Chinchillidae extends from Eocene/early
Oligocene to Recent (Vucetich et al., 1999, 2010; Flynn et al.,

Kerber et al_.pdf   1 26/12/2011   17:16:11

2003). Molecular studies confirmed that the extant
Chinchillidae are a monophyletic group (Spotorno et al., 2004)
and suggest a close relationship with Dinomyidae (Huchon
&amp;amp; Douzery, 2001). Extant chinchillids have euhypsodont cheek
teeth, composed of laminar and oblique prisms, labially (upper
teeth) or lingually (lower teeth) united, with a very thin
interlaminar cement layer, bullae well developed and
locomotion partially saltatory (Wood, 1955; Bondesio et al.,
1975). According to Pocock (1922), Chinchillidae includes
two subfamilies, Chinchillinae and Lagostominae.
Chinchillines have cheek teeth with two flexi/flexids and three
lophs/ids, and the lagostomines have two lophs/ids,
separated by only one flexus/flexid. Lagostomines are
represented in the fossil record since the Oligocene (Vucetich
et al., 1999, 2010). For the Pliocene and Pleistocene, two
genera have been described: Lagostomopsis Kraglievich,
1926 from Montehermosan and Chapadmalalan ages, and
Lagostomus from Barrancalobian to Recent (Vucetich &amp;amp; Verzi,
1995). However, according to Vucetich &amp;amp; Verzi (1995) the
differences between these taxa are mainly of size. In the
absence of more diagnostic characters, Vucetich &amp;amp; Verzi (1995)
suggested that the only valid genus in the Pliocene/
Pleistocene is Lagostomus. The same problem is present in
the extinct species of Lagostomus because their diagnoses
are also based on size (see Gervais &amp;amp; Ameghino, 1880), which
is quite variable in the living Lagostomus (Llanos &amp;amp; Crespo,
1952). The current taxonomy of the family and extinct species
of Lagostomus needs review (Vucetich &amp;amp; Verzi, 1995; Candela,
2005), as well as cladistic analyses, including fossil and extant
taxa.

Caviidae are taxonomically diverse caviomorphs, often
small and cursorial, with euhypsodont cheek teeth (Wood,
1955). The group originated in the middle/late Miocene
(Vucetich et al., 1999) and achieved its greatest diversity
during the late Pliocene (Quintana, 1997). According to Paula
Couto (1979), the family includes an extinct subfamily, the
Cardiomyinae (but see Pérez, 2010), and two extant
subfamilies, the Caviinae and the Dolichotinae. Dolichotines
share the following characters: the skull with the foramen
magnum displaced ventrally, diastema longer than P4-M3
series, absent nasolacrimal foramen on the maxilla, and
mesopterygoid fossa reaching the M2 (Paula Couto, 1979;
Quintana, 1998; Ubilla &amp;amp; Rinderknecht, 2003). The Quaternary
dolichotines are represented by a single genus, Dolichotis
Desmarest, 1820 (including Pediolagus), with two species,
D. patagonum Zimmermann, 1780 and D. salinicola
(Burmeister, 1876).

Until now, the Pleistocene fossil record of caviomorph
rodents in southern Brazil only included Caviidae,
Hydrochoeridae and Echimyidae. For the continental shelf
of Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), Rodrigues &amp;amp; Ferigolo (2004)
described several teeth and a fragment of a dentary of
Myocastor coypus (Molina, 1782), a P4 of Dolichotinae indet.,
and a dentary of Eumysopinae indet. For Chuí Creek,
southernmost of RS, Ubilla et al. (2008) reported cranial

fragments and postcranial elements of Microcavia Gervais
&amp;amp; Ameghino, 1880. From Touro Passo Formation, remains of
H. hydrochaeris (Linnaeus, 1766), Caviidae indet., and Galea
Meyen, 1832 have been recognized (Kerber &amp;amp; Oliveira, 2008;
Kerber &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 2011; Kerber et al., 2011) and for Quaraí
River, Oliveira (1992) referred H. hydrochaeris.

This paper reports new remains assigned to a Chinchillidae
and a Dolichotinae from Chuí Creek (upper Pleistocene),
southern Brazil and discusses the late Pleistocene fossil record
of both taxa as well as the paleobiogeographic implications
of these findings.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The specimens studied herein are stored in the
paleovertebrate collection of Museu Coronel Tancredo
Fernandes de Melo (MCTFM in Santa Vitória do Palmar, RS)
and Laboratório de Geologia e Paleontologia da Universida-
de Federal do Rio Grande (LGP-V in Rio Grande, RS).

The material of Chinchillidae was compared to the extant
chinchillids Lagostomus maximus (Desmarest, 1817),
Chinchilla and Lagidium (from Argentina); and the
Dolichotinae were compared with the caviids Dolichotis
patagonum, D. salinicola, Microcavia, Galea (from Argen-
tina) and Kerodon F. Cuvier, 1825 (from northeast Brazil)
(Appendix 1). Traditionally, Kerodon was considered a
Caviinae. However, in recent papers, using molecular and
paleontological evidence, it has been considered more closely
related to Hydrochoeridae (Rowe &amp;amp; Honeycutt, 2002; Pérez,
2010). It was included in this comparison because it shares
several dental features with Caviidae.

The mandibular nomenclature follows Woods &amp;amp; Howland
(1979) and Pérez (2010), and the dental nomenclature of
Caviidae follows Quintana (1996). The measurements were
taken with a digital caliper accurate to 0.01 mm and
stereomicroscope, and are expressed in millimeters.

Lujanian age [Equus (A.) neogaeus Biozone, sensu Cione &amp;amp;
Tonni, 1999] are found in Chuí Creek (Oliveira et al., 2005),
collected from a ~1.5 meter-thick muddy sandstone bed
(Lopes et al., 2001, 2005). The fossils are found articulated or
isolated, mostly fragmented, but sometimes complete and
well-preserved specimens, probably deposited and reworked
in a meandering fluvial system. According to Buchmann et
al. (2009) the presence of a fossiliferous bed, lenses of organic
matter-rich sediments interpreted as abandoned meanders
(oxbow lakes), a high proportion of fossils broken after burial,
and occurrence of fossils at a considerable distance from the

present course of the creek, suggest that the fossils were
accumulated and reworked in a wide flood plain. Lopes et al.
(2010) dated teeth of megamammals from the fossiliferous
level using Electron Spin Resonance, showing ages between
42 and 33 Ka BP. The fossiliferous bed contains fossils of
large-bodied mammals, mostly herbivores, including
xenarthrans and ungulates, while carnivores are very scarce
in comparison (Oliveira, 1992; Oliveira et al., 2005; Marcon,
2008; Oliveira &amp;amp; Pereira, 2009; Scherer et al., 2009; Lopes &amp;amp;
Pereira, 2010). Remains of medium- and small-sized mammals
are scarcely represented.

Material. MCTFM-PV 0769, left dentary lacking the posteri-
or portion, with very fragmented cheek teeth.
Geographical and stratigraphic provenance. Chuí Creek, in
the upper portion of the muddy sandstone bed. Santa Vitória
do Palmar, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.
Description and comparison. The dorsal area of the diastema
is thin and forms a tenuous crest that extends from the mesial
face of p4 alveolus up to the symphysis. The alveolus of the
incisor forms a well-developed prominence on the medial
surface of the dentary, which extends up to the level of m3, as
in Lagostomus maximus and different from Chinchilla and
Lagidium, in which it extends up to the m1/m2 level. The
coronoid process is located at the level of the distal area of
the m3 alveolus, being posteriorly oriented. This process is
thin and is different from Chinchilla and Lagidium, in which
it is located posteriorly to the m3 and more vertical. The lunar
notch is deeper than in Chinchilla and Lagidium. The man-
dibular foramen is located on the dorsal surface of the dentary,
posteromedially to the m3 alveolus. The notch for the

insertion of the tendon of the masseter medialis pars
infraorbitalis muscle is located below m1 and m2, as in L.
maximus and Lagidium, while in Chinchilla the notch is
below m1. The incisor is slightly longitudinally striated on
the labial face. The cheek teeth are very fragmented, but it
can be seen that they are bilophodont and obliquely oriented,
features that characterize Lagostominae. In size, MCTFM-
PV 0769 is smaller than the adult males of L. maximus, but
more similar to the young males and adult females analyzed
(Table 1).

Description and comparison. The description is based on
MCTFM-PV 0736, which is the best preserved, but the
same characters are also observed in LGP-V 0001. MCTFM-
PV 0736 is euhypsodont and biprismatic (Figure 3A). It
has a linguolabial curvature (Figure 3B) and is slightly
mesiodistally curved, with the apex more distal than the
occlusal surface (Figures 3C-D), characterizing a lower tooth.

The hypoflexid is well developed, transversally oriented,
and its lingual end largely surpasses the middle of the
tooth. Opposite to the hypoflexid, there is a shallow furrow
located between both prisms (Figure 3A). The prisms are
transversally oriented, with similar size and shape, and are
united by a thinner and shorter isthmus (Figure 3A) than
those of the Galea, Microcavia and Kerodon (Figures
4A-C). The lingual area of the prisms is more convex than
in Galea, Microcavia and Kerodon. The material is
morphologically very similar to D. salinicola and D.
patagonum (Figures 4D-E), but smaller than the adult
specimens of D. patagonum (Table 2).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The specimen MCTFM-PV 0769 is assigned to the genus
Lagostomus based on the tooth structure with two oblique
laminae, coronoid process located at the level of the distal
area of the m3 alveolus and posteriorly oriented and striated
incisor extending up to the m3 level. The material does not
differ from L. maximus, but given its fragmentary status, it is
assigned to Lagostomus cf. L. maximus.

The specimens MCTFM-PV 0736 and LGP-V 0001 are
assigned to Dolichotinae based on the characteristic tooth
structure of two chordiform lobes with only one poorly-
developed external furrow opposite to the hypoflexid
(Kraglievich, 1930). These characteristics are similar to
Dolichotis (Figures 4D-E); however the material is scarce
and there are no characters that allow it to be confidently
assigned to a genus or species.

Today, Lagostomus maximus inhabits plains of southern
Bolivia, western Paraguay and central Argentina (Figure 5A)
(Llanos &amp;amp; Crespo, 1952; Jackson et al., 1996 and references
therein). Extant Dolichotinae are also represented in these
regions, but reaching higher latitudes than Lagostomus
(Cabrera, 1961; Eisenberg &amp;amp; Redford, 1989; Campos et al.,
2001 and references therein) (Figure 5B).

Previous confirmed Pleistocene records of Lagostomus
were from Argentina and Uruguay (Figure 5A). The Danish
naturalist Peter W. Lund (1841) mentioned a Lagostominae
(Lagostomus brasiliensis) from the karst of Lagoa Santa
(Minas Gerais State, Brazil), based on a fragmented dentary
and one euhypsodont and bilaminar tooth (Lund, 1841:pl.

XXV, figs. 1-3; pl. XXVI, figs 1-4). However, in the review of
Lagoa Santa rodents, Winge (1888) did not recognize this
taxon (Paula Couto, 1950: footnotes 36 and 318). In fact, the
drawings by Lund (1841) are not clear enough to identify this
material. For example, the tooth is about 50% narrower than
in Lagostomus maximus. In addition, the occlusal design
shows completely independent laminae separated by a thick
layer of cement (Lund, 1841:pl. XXV, fig. 2a), even thicker
than in Miocene lagostomines.

The confirmation of the presence of Lagostomus in the
Quaternary from the Intertropical region of Brazil (sensu
Cartelle, 1999) depends on the discovery of new remains.
According to Cione et al. (1999), during the Quaternary of
Argentina, Lagostomus first occurs in the Ensenadan. In
Argentina, Lagostomus sp. is recorded for late Pleistocene
in Buenos Aires Province at Punta Hermengo (Tonni &amp;amp; Fidal-
go, 1982) and Dolores locality (Chimento, 2007), and also in
Córdoba Province (Cruz et al., 2009). L. maximus is a guide
fossil for the Platan age (Holocene) (Cione &amp;amp; Tonni, 1999),
though the species also occurs in the late Pleistocene at

at Arroyo Seco 2 (Gómez et al., 1999) and Cueva Tixi, both in
Buenos Aires Province (Tonni et al., 1988). In Uruguay,
Lagostomus sp. was reported for the late Pleistocene at El
Caño locality, and Libertad and Dolores formations (Ubilla &amp;amp;
Perea, 1999; Ubilla et al., 2009).

The Quaternary fossil record of Dolichotinae is very
scarce. The only genus recognized is Dolichotis (Figure 5B),

which is known from the late Pliocene at least (Vucetich &amp;amp;
Verzi, 1995; Verzi &amp;amp; Quintana, 2005). In the late Pleistocene,
Dolichotis sp. was reported for Arroyo Toropí, Corrientes
Province, Argentina (Scillato-Yané et al., 1998); and the So-
pas Formation, Uruguay (Ubilla et al., 2004). Dolichotis cf.
D. patagonum was mentioned for the late Pleistocene at Jesús
María, Córdoba Province, Argentina (Sarrat, 2009) and
Dolores Formation, Uruguay (Ubilla et al., 2009). D. salinicola
was reported for the late Pleistocene of Buenos Aires Province
(Tonni, 1981). A P4 of Dolichotinae indet. was reported for
the continental shelf of southern Brazil (Rodrigues &amp;amp; Ferigolo,
2004), but unfortunately these submarine deposits have no
stratigraphic context, and the associated fossils encompass
ages from Ensenadan to Lujanian (Lopes et al., 2010). Thus,
Lagostomus cf. L. maximus described here is the first positive
record of a Chinchillidae from Brazil, and Dolichotinae
confirms the presence of this subfamily in the late Pleistocene
of southern Brazil.

Lagostomus maximus usually lives in open areas, with
grasslands or shrubs, often characterized by little rain
(Eisenberg &amp;amp; Redford, 1989). They are colonial diggers that
live in colonial burrows systems, the “vizcacheras”, which
are occupied by many generations (Llanos &amp;amp; Crespo, 1952;
Villarreal et al., 2001). According to Villarreal et al. (2001), the
vizcachas are found together with other mammals that indicate
dry environments, such as the xenarthrans Chaetophractus
villosus (Desmarest, 1804) and Zaedyus pichiy (Desmarest,
1804). Although predominantly associated with dry
environments, Lagostomus seems to be more tolerant than
Chinchilla and Lagidium, being found in arid to subtropical
environments, with rainfall ranging from&amp;lt;300 mm in west
central region of Argentina to &gt; 1000 mm in the north the
country (Jackson et al., 1996). The dolichotines are cursorial
rodents and restricted to arid and semi-arid environments
(Einsenberg &amp;amp; Redford, 1989; Campos et al., 2001).

Diverse taxa indicative of open areas and environments
drier than today’s have been reported for the late Pleistocene
of southern Brazil, such as camelids, the tayassuid Catagonus
and the rodent Microcavia (Scherer et al., 2007; Ubilla et al.,
2008; Gasparini et al., 2009). However, the presence of
Myocastor in Chuí Creek suggests the presence of permanent
water bodies. These discrepancies perhaps can be explained
by the presence of mosaic environments (Bombin, 1975; 1976).
The palynological data available for the late Pleistocene of
Rio Grande do Sul State suggest a predominance of open
areas and grasslands (Bauermann et al., 2009 and references
therein). Based on the ecology of the living taxa, the material
reported here is consistent with this pattern. The presence of
Lagostomus and Dolichotinae in southern Brazil, together
with Microcavia which has a similar distribution, is probably
related to the latitudinal displacements of the environmental
and climatic belts during the late Pleistocene.

ABSTRACT – The Chuí Creek, located in the southernmost Brazil, is a fossiliferous outcrop known since the late 1960s, 
which bears important records of late Pleistocene mammals, other vertebrates and invertebrate fossils. The presence of some 
taxa (e.g. Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus, Tapirus terrestris Linnaeus, Ozotoceros bezoarticus Linneaus), although 
mentioned on the literature, is still to be confirmed. Specimens from Chuí Creek belonging to several collections are reexamined 
and new excavations and geological surveys in the area are being conducted. The new records include isolated teeth of cf. 
Ursidae and Rodentia (Myocastor cf. M. coypus Molina); a complete and articulated skull and jaw of a tayassuid, Catagonus 
Ameghino, as well as a left dentary of a juvenile ground sloth, Eremotherium cf. E. laurillardi Lund. The ongoing systematic 
revision led to the confirmation of the presence of the glyptodont Doedicurus Burmeister, represented by a portion of the 
carapace; the cervid genera Antifer Ameghino and Morenelaphus Carette; and the equids Equus Linnaeus and Hippidion Owen, 
represented by cranial and dental remains. These findings expand the knowledge on the diversity of the extinct fauna found in 
the Chuí Creek, and have biogeographic, biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental implications, which are herein discussed.

RESUMO – O Arroio Chuí, situado no extremo sul do Brasil, é um afloramento fossilífero conhecido desde o final da década 
de 1960 e contém importantes registros de mamíferos, outros vertebrados e invertebrados fósseis do final do Pleistoceno. A 
presença de determinados táxons mencionados na literatura (e.g. Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus, Tapirus terrestris 
Linnaeus, Ozotoceros bezoarticus Linnaeus) ainda necessita confirmação. Fósseis provenientes do Arroio Chuí depositados 
em diferentes coleções vêm sendo revisados, e novas escavações e levantamentos geológicos vêm sendo desenvolvidos neste 
depósito. Os novos registros incluem dentes isolados de cf. Ursidae e Rodentia (Myocastor cf. M. coypus Molina); crânio 
e mandíbula completos e articulados de Catagonus Ameghino e um dentário esquerdo de Eremotherium cf. E. laurillardi 
Lund. A revisão sistemática levou à confirmação da presença do gliptodonte Doedicurus Burmeister, representado por parte 
de carapaça; de cervídeos dos gêneros Antifer Ameghino e Morenelaphus Carette, representados por galhadas incompletas; 
e dos equídeos Equus Linnaeus e Hippidion Owen, representados por restos cranianos e dentários. Estes achados ampliam 
o conhecimento sobre a diversidade da fauna extinta encontrada no Arroio Chuí, além de terem implicações biogeográficas, 
bioestratigráficas e paleoambientais, as quais são aqui discutidas.

INTRODUCTION

The fossil mammals from the Coastal Plain of Rio Grande 
do Sul State (CPRS), southern Brazil; have been known since 
the final of the Century XIX, after the first records by the 
German naturalist Hermann Von Ihering (Oliveira, 1996). 
In this geomorphologic unit, such remains are found in 
fossiliferous concentrations along the continental shelf (Lopes 

&amp;amp; Buchmann, 2010) and in the outcrops exposed along the 
banks of the Chuí Creek (Lopes et al., 2001, 2009). The fossils 
from the continental shelf are collected along the beach, where 
are thrown by storm waves, therefore do not have a precise 
stratigraphic context (Buchmann, 2002). Fossils of extinct 
mammals from the Chuí Creek were first reported in 1965, 
when the Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas 
(DNOCS) excavated and modified the course of this creek for

irrigation purposes. During these excavations, the fossiliferous 
beds were exposed, and the paleontologists Carlos de Paula 
Couto and Fausto de Souza Cunha brought a large number of 
fossils to the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro (Paula Couto 
&amp;amp; Souza Cunha, 1965; Henriques, 1992). 

Recently, several studies have expanded the knowledge 
about the fossil content, geology and biostratigraphy (e.g. 
Oliveira, 1992; Lopes et al., 2001; Oliveira et al., 2005; Lopes 
et al., 2001, 2009; Kerber et al., 2011a; Lopes, in press). In 
a geologic survey of the CPRS (Delaney, 1965), the fossil 
mammals were considered of Tertiary age, associated to the 
Graxaim Formation. In the same year, however, Paula Couto 
&amp;amp; Souza Cunha (1965) correlated the fossils to the “Pampeano 
superior (Bonaerense)” of Argentina (late Pleistocene) (see 
also Soliani Jr., 1973). Posteriorly, Bombin (1975) analyzed 
the faunal similarity of the fossil mammals from Argentina, 
Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul (RS), concluding that fossils 
from RS are from Lujanian Land-Mammal Age (sensu 
Pascual et al., 1966). Absolute ages obtained by Electron 
Spin Resonance (ESR) dating of fossil teeth from Chuí 
Creek showed results between 226 and 34 ka (Lopes et al., 
2010), thus indicating that the fauna from the Chuí Creek 
encompasses a larger time span than was estimated before by 
Bombin (1975). The lithologies exposed along the banks and 
the taphonomic features suggest that the fossils were deposited 
and reworked in a meandering fluvial system (Lopes, 2009; 
Lopes et al., 2009). 

Although studied for several years, the exact taxonomic 
composition of mammals from the creek is discussed. In a 
report about the geology and paleontology of CPRS, Paula 
Couto &amp;amp; Souza Cunha (1965) have listed several mammalian 
taxa, but did not discriminate between fossils collected along 
the beach and those collected in the creek. In his stratigraphic 
and paleontologic study on this creek, Soliani Jr. (1973) 
presented a systematic list based on verbal communication 
by Carlos de Paula Couto and in the description of ungulate 
fossils collected by Souza Cunha (1959) along the beach. 

Most of the fossils deposited in the Museu Nacional 
(Rio de Janeiro) by Carlos de Paula Couto and Fausto de 
Souza Cunha were never formally described, except for 
Lestodon armatus Gervais, 1855 reported by Henriques 
(1992) and Holmesina paulacoutoi Cartelle &amp;amp; Bohórquez, 
1985 described by Oliveira (1992) and Oliveira &amp;amp; Pereira 
(2009). Other papers (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2005; Oliveira 
&amp;amp; Pereira, 2009) have listed taxa from Chuí Creek such as 
Equus neogaeus Lund, 1840, Hippidion principale Lund, 
1845, Ozotocerus bezoarticus Linnaeus, 1758, Blastocerus 
dichotomus Illiger, 1815, Antifer sp. Ameghino, 1889, 
Smilodon populator Lund, 1842, Megatherium americanum 
Cuvier, 1796, and Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris Linnaeus, 
1766, whose occurrence have never been confirmed, neither 
formally described. 

In this paper, new findings of Pleistocene mammals from Chuí 
Creek are described; the presence of some previously mentioned 
taxa are confirmed and biogeographic, biostratigraphic and 
paleoenvironmental implications are discussed. An updated list 
of known taxa is presented (Appendix 1).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The specimens reported herein are deposited in the 
paleovertebrate collections of the Museu Coronel Tancredo 
Fernandes de Mello (Santa Vitória do Palmar, RS) and 
Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG, Rio Grande, 
RS). All specimens were measured using precision calipers.

de Mello, Santa Vitória do Palmar, RS. 

 
LOCATION AND GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The specimens come from a fossiliferous bed exposed 
along the banks of Chuí Creek, located 6 km from Santa 
Vitória do Palmar municipality, in the southernmost RS, 
next to the border between Brasil and Uruguay (Figure 
1). The creek flows in a NE-SW direction, parallell to the 
coastline up to the Chuí County, where it turns eastwards 
until reaching the Atlantic Ocean. The plain through which 
the creek flows is located between two Pleistocene coastal 
barriers: the Barrier II, located westwards and the Barrer III 
located eastwards of the creek. Although precise ages have 
not yet been determined, it is estimated that the Barrier II 
was formed by the 325 ka AP marine transgression and the 
Barrier II by the 123 ka AP transgression (Tomazelli et al., 
2000).

The base of the sedimentary sequence exposed along 
the banks is constituted by shallow marine sediments, 
containing the ichnofossil Ophiomorpha nodosa Lundgren, 
1891 and large numbers of marine shells. The layer above 
contains the mammalian remains; it is composed by sand 
with an upward increase in silt. This layer seems to have 
been deposited in a meandering fluvial system (Lopes et 
al., 2009). Although this layer is some 2,5 m thick, until 
now the mammalian fossils found in situ are restricted 
to a ~1meter-thick horizon at its lower portion. Fossils 
were not found in the uppermost portion of this layer 
until now. At some points along the banks, just above the 
mammalian remains, the fossiliferous layer exhibits a 30 to 
40 cm thick level of carbonate nodules and rhizocretions, 
called “Caliche Cordão” by Delaney (1965). Besides the 
remains found in situ, several other fossils can be found 
removed from the original layer due to erosion of the 
banks and by dredging activities. The uppermost portion 
of sequence is composed by a ~70 cm-thick dark, muddy 
sand, corresponding to the Holocene and containing 
archaeological artifacts (Schmitz et al., 1997).

Except for the bear canine and the equid skull, collected 
and donated by other persons, all remains were collected by 
authors on the fossiliferous level exposed along the banks 
of the creek.

SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY

XENARTHRA Cope, 1889
PILOSA Flower, 1883

MEGATHERIIDAE Owen, 1843
Genus Eremotherium Spillmann, 1948

Eremotherium cf. E. laurillardi Lund, 1842
(Figure 2A)

Material. Left dentary (EPM-PV 0133).
Description. The dentary has the molariforms preserved, 
with exception of m1, which is fragmented. The small size 
of the specimen indicates that it is a juvenile. The dorsal 
portion of the symphysis is fragmented; the first alveolus is 
fragmented on both labial and lingual sides, and the remaining 
of the dental series is fragmented in the lingual side. The 
m1 has preserved only a fragment of its base, which shows 
that its distal portion was slightly convex and wider than the 
mesial one. The remaining molars are well preserved and all 
exhibit the distal side more convex than the mesial one. The 
m2 exhibit labial side slightly longer mesiodistally than the 
lingual one; the m3 exhibit subquadrate outline and is the 

widest one; the m4 bears a mesial ridge considerably wider 
and mesiodistally compressed than the distal one, giving it a 
subtriangular outline. The posterior end of the angular process 
and the coronoid process were not preserved. The articular 
condyle is partly broken, mostly the medial portion. 

The specimen EPM-PV0133 is assigned as Eremotherium 
on the basis of the following characteres: symphysis reaching 
up to the m1 (in Megatherium Cuvier, 1796 it reaches up to the 
m2) and slightly projected dorsally, above the level of dental 
series (which is ventrally curved in Megatherium); ventral 
bulge of the dentary less developed than in Megatherium; 
a shallow sulcus between m4 and the ascending ramus (in 
Megatherium a deep sulcus); angular process posteriorly 
projected, at the same level of the horizontal ramus (in 
Megatherium dorsally projected, above the dental series) 
and articular condyle projected posteriorly (in Megatherium 
dorsally projected) (Owen, 1861; Cartelle, 1992; Cartelle &amp;amp; 
De Iullis, 1995). 
Measurements (mm). Maximum length: 217,0; length of the 
cheek teeth series: 80,0; dentary height (measured in the m3 
region): 56,0; maximum height at the level of the mandibular 
condyle: 92,0.
Comments. Two taxa of Pleistocene megatheriids are 
currently referred for Brazil: Megatherium americanum, 
restricted to RS, and Eremotherium laurillardi, which 
inhabited the intertropical areas of Americas (Cartelle 
&amp;amp; DeIuliis, 1995). The fossil record of Eremotherium is 
common in the intertropical region of Brazil (e.g. Cartelle 
&amp;amp; DeIullis, 1995; Dantas &amp;amp; Zucon, 2005; Dantas &amp;amp; Zucon, 
2007; Dantas &amp;amp; Tasso, 2007; Ribeiro &amp;amp; Carvalho, 2009), with 
only one previous record for southern Brazil (Toledo, 1986). 
Cartelle (1992) stated that the morphological characters of 
Eremotherium do not differ considerably between juveniles 
and adults, thus the specimen reported here is assigned to 
this genus. It probably represents E. laurillardi, the only 
valid species from the Brazilian Pleistocene (Cartelle &amp;amp; 
DeIuliis, 1995). The southernmost record of this species was 
in Caçapava do Sul municipality, located in the central area 
of RS, some 400 km NW of Chuí Creek (Toledo, 1986); thus, 
the record of Eremotherium in the outcrops of Chuí Creek 
expands its known paleogeographic distribution being in 
this way the southernmost record for the Americas until now. 

CINGULATA Illiger, 1881
GLYPTODONTIDAE Burmeister, 1879

Genus Doedicurus Burmeister, 1874

Doedicurus sp. 
(Figure 2B)

Material. Fragment of carapace (MCTFM-PV 0445).
Description. The specimen presents about 13 fused 
osteoderms. The sutures between them are barely discernible. 
Each osteoderm has 30-50 mm in diameter and bears 5-6 
pilose foramina measuring about 5 mm in diameter. The 
osteoderms of Doedicurus are distinguished by the presence 
of large foramina in a circle on the central portion. Differently

from other glyptodonts, such as Glyptodon and Panochthus, 
their surface is smooth without ornamentation. 
Comments. The occurrence of Doedicurus in Brazil is 
restricted to RS (Paula Couto 1975, 1979), and the known 
specimens come mostly from the continental shelf. This taxon 
is rare in comparison to Glyptodon and Panochthus, what 
also happens among the remains from Chuí Creek. The only 
previous record of this taxon in Chuí Creek was presented 
by Oliveira (1992). 

RODENTIA Bowdich, 1821
HYSTRICOGNATHI Tullberg, 1899

CAVIOMORPHA Wood &amp;amp; Patterson (in Wood, 1955)
ECHIMYIDAE Gray, 1825

MYOCASTORINAE Ameghino, 1904
Genus Myocastor Kerr, 1792

Myocastor cf. M. coypus (Molina, 1782)
(Figure 2C)

Material. Right M2 (MCTFM-PV 0732).
Description. The specimen is protohypsodont, with rectangular 
outline and all flexi open. The hypoflex is extended up to the 
middle of the occlusal surface, and is opposite to the protoloph, 
between the paraflex and the mesoflex, as described for 
Myocastor (Verzi et al., 2002). The labial flexi (paraflex and 
mesoflex) have the same size than the hypoflex, while the 
metaflex is more developed, reaching almost the entire width of 
the occlusal surface. The characters observed in this specimen 
are the same of M. coypus; however, due to the scarcity of the 
material, it is assigned to Myocastor cf. M. coypus. 
Measurements (mm). Maximum height: 12,9; mesiodistal 
length: 8,14; labiolingual width: 7,04.
Comments. The previous record of fossil rodents from Chuí 
Creek is very scarce, represented by cranial and postcranial 
remains of Microcavia Gervais &amp;amp; Ameghino, 1880 described 
by Ubilla et al. (2008) and remains of Dolichotinae indet. and 
Lagostomus Brookes, 1828 reported by Kerber et al. (2011a). 
The stratigraphic distribution of Myocastor extends from the 
late Miocene (Mesopotamian) (Candela &amp;amp; Noriega, 2004) 
to Recent. For Pleistocene assemblages, Myocastor have 
been reported for Bolivia, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil 
(Frailey et al., 1980; Ubilla, 2004; Ferrero &amp;amp; Noriega, 2009). 
Rodrigues &amp;amp; Ferigolo (2004) described remains of M. coypus 
from the continental shelf of RS, and Kerber et al. (2011b) 
referred remains of Myocastor sp. from the continental upper 
Pleistocene beds from RS. The extant M. coypus lives in 
permanently wet environments of Uruguay, Argentina, Chile 
and southern Brazil (Woods et al., 1992).

CARNIVORA Bowdich, 1821
cf. URSIDAE Fischer de Waldheim, 1817

(Figure 2D)

Material. Complete right upper canine (MCTFM-PV 0710). 
Description. The specimen is large and exhibits wear on the 

crown apex, exposing dentine. The crown represents 1/3 of 
the tooth, and bears a distinct ridge on the mesial side. The 
cross section is subcircular, and the root is wider at its middle, 
becoming narrower towards the base. The root is closed, a 
little narrower than the limit of the crown. The root exhibit 
surface crackings that suggest weathering. 
Measurements (mm). Maximum height: 99,0; crown height: 
40,0; mesiodistal length (at the crown base): 25,0; labiolingual 
width (at the crown base): 22,0; maximum diameter: 32,0.
Comments. Fossil remains of Carnivora are very scarce 
in RS. The previous record of this group in CPRS is 
almost exclusively from the continental shelf. It includes 
the felid Smilodon populator Lund, 1842; the pinnipeds 
Arctocephalus sp. Saint-Hilaire &amp;amp; Cuvier, 1826 and Otaria 
byronia Blainville, 1820; and the canids Dusicyon cf. avus 
and Theriodictis sp. Mercerat, 1891 (Moreira, 1970; Oliveira 
&amp;amp; Drehmer, 1997; Drehmer &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1998; Rodrigues et 
al., 2004). From the Chuí Creek, the only records so far are 
Protocyon troglodytes and Dusicyon avus Burmeister, 1866 
(Oliveira et al., 2005; Pereira et al., 2011). Paula Couto (1975) 
mentioned the presence of S. populator in the “Santa Vitória 
Formation”, but did not specify whether the specimen came 
from the Chuí Creek or from the continental shelf. 

In South America, the Ursidae are recorded from the early 
Pleistocene to the Recent, and represented by the extinct genus 
Arctotherium, the only valid Pleistocene taxon (Soibelzon, 
2004; Soibelzon et al., 2005) and the living Tremarctus 
ornatus Cuvier, 1825 in Geoffroy St. Hilaire &amp;amp; Cuvier, 1825. 

ARTIODACTYLA Owen, 1848
CERVIDAE Gray, 1821

Genus Antifer Ameghino, 1889

Antifer sp. 
(Figures 3A-B)

Material. Incomplete antler (MCTFM-PV 0581); fragment 
of the base of an antler (LGP-I0003).
Description. Both specimens are assigned as Antifer by their 
large dimensions and presence of surface ornamentation in 
the form of well-marked longitudinal grooves, with small 
tubercles at the base (Castellanos, 1945). The specimen 
MCTFM-PV 0581 is an almost complete right antler (Figure 
3A), concave on the medial side and convex on the lateral 
one. The medial surface bears a longitudinal depression; 
the 1st ramification is mediolaterally flattened, and the rami 
are subcircular in cross section. At the height of the 2nd 
ramification the axis of the antler is flattened mediolaterally, 
giving it a subrectangular cross section. The specimen 
LGP-I0003 consists of the basal portion of a left antler (Figure 
3B), longitudinally broken on the posterior side.
Measurements (mm). MCTFM-PV 0581. Maximum 
height: 440,0; height of the bifurcation: 163,0; maximum 
anteroposterior and transversal diameters: 58,0 and 
53,0, respectively. LGP-I0003. Maximum height: 68,5; 
anteroposterior diameter: 34,0; transversal diameter: 35,0.
Comments. The morphological features of the specimen

REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PALEONTOLOGIA, 15(2), 2012232

MCTFM-PV 0581 are similar to the description of Antifer 
ultra (Ameghino, 1888) by Castellanos (1945). The distinction 
between the two species of this genus recognized by Ameghino, 
A. ensenadensis (Ameghino, 1888) and A. ultra, is based on 
size differences between both, but it is possible that these are 
only a result of intraspecific variations (Menégaz, 2000). In 
the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina, the genus Antifer 
is restricted to Ensenandan Stage/Age (A. ensenadensis) and 
Bonaerian Stage/Age (A. ultra) (Cione &amp;amp; Tonni, 1999; Cione 
et al., 1999). However, this taxon has been reported for the late 
Pleistocene of northern Chile (Quebrada Quereo Formation, 
Labarca &amp;amp; López, 2006), Argentine Mesopotamian (Toropí 
Formation, Alcaraz &amp;amp; Zurita, 2004; Tezanos Pinto Formation, 
Ferrero &amp;amp; Noriega, 2009; El Palmar Formation, Ferrero et al., 
2007), Uruguay (Sopas Formation, Ubilla, 2004) and western 

RS (Touro Passo Creek, Scherer et al., 2007; Kerber &amp;amp; Oliveira, 
2008a). This fact suggests that Antifer may have survived in the 
late Pleistocene of this area (Lopes &amp;amp; Pereira, 2009).

EPM-PV 0145, MCTFM-PV 0534, LGP-I0005, LGP-I 0006 
and LGP-I 0008). 
Description. These specimens are smaller in comparison to 
specimens of Antifer and the surface ornamentation is less

evident; slightly curved in “S”, as described for Morenelaphus  
(see Figure 3 C’) (Kraglievich, 1940; Menégaz &amp;amp; Ortiz 
Jaureguizar, 1995); and less robust than Blastocerus Wagner, 
1844. The angle between the axis and the 1st ramification is more 
open than that of Antifer. Specimen MCTFM-PV0578 (Figures 
3C, C’) is still attached to a skull fragment, portions of occipital 
and parietal regions. Specimen MCTFM-PV0579 (Figures 3D, 
D’) also bears part of the skull, but smaller; the space between 
the rosette and the 1st ramus is large, and the axis is less sinuous 
in comparison to the specimen MCTFM- PV0578. Specimen 
LGP-I0005 is the only fossil known so far from the Chuí Creek 
that exhibits carbonate concretions on its surface (Lopes, 2009). 
Comments. In previous publications (e.g. Paula Couto 
&amp;amp; Souza Cunha, 1965; Soliani Jr., 1973; Souza Cunha &amp;amp; 
Magalhães, 1981), the presence of the cervids Morenelaphus 
and Ozotoceros Ameghino, 1889 was mentioned for the Chuí 
Creek. Oliveira et al. (2005) listed Antifer and Ozotoceros for 
Chuí Creek, but they not referred and described the materials. 
Scherer et al. (2007), in a review of the fossil cervids from 
the CPRS, did not identify remains of Ozotoceros. Here we 
confirmed the presence of Antifer and Morenelaphus in the Chuí 
Creek. Besides the remains described here, there are several 
other cervid fragments that could not have been conclusively 
identified either as Antifer, Morenelaphus or other genera.

Measurements (mm). MCTFM-PV 0575a. Skull, total length: 
315,0; maximum height: 114,0; upper cheek teeth length: 74,0. 
MCTFM-PV 0575b. Mandible, total length: 168,0; height at 
the condyle: 93,0; lower cheek teeth length: 80,0.
Comments. In South America, the Tayassuidae have a 
stratigraphic distribution that range from late Pliocene to 
Recent, and is represented by three genera (Gasparini, in 
press): Platygonus Le Conte, 1848, Tayassu Fischer, 1814, 
and Catagonus. Only the last two have living representatives. 
The living species Catagonus wagneri Rusconi, 1930 was 
discovered only in the 1970s (Wetzel et al., 1975). Fossils 
of Catagonus have been reported for Pleistocene of Bolivia, 
Argentina and Uruguay (Gasparini, in press); in Brazil it 
has been recorded for caves of Minas Gerais, Tocantins and 
Paraná states and Touro Passo Creek (RS) (Paula Couto, 
1981; Gasparini et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2010; Ávilla et al., 
2010). The current distribution of C. wagneri is restricted 
to the Chaco, in Paraguay and Bolivia, where semi-arid 
conditions are predominant (Mayer &amp;amp; Brant, 1982; Mayer 
&amp;amp; Wetzel, 1986). The wide paleobiogeographic distribution 
of Catagonus can be related to the presence of dryer 
environments during the Pleistocene (Menégaz &amp;amp; Ortiz 
Jaureguizar, 1995). This specimen needs a more comparative 
study to determine its specific status, as well as, a complete 
description of its anatomic features.

Genus Equus Linnaeus, 1758

Equus cf. E. (A.) neogaeus Lund, 1840
(Figures 4B-C)

Material. Incomplete skull (MCTFM-PV 0618). 
Description. The specimen represents part of the rostral 
portion of a skull, without incisors but with the left canine 
and cheek teeth series preserved (lacking the M2 and M3). 
The nasals are fractured, but it is visible that the retraction 
of the nasal fissure begins anteriorly to the P2, differently 
from Hippidion which have a long fissure reaching at least 
the M2 or M3 (Alberdi &amp;amp; Prado, 1992; Alberdi et al., 2003). 
The palatal surface is flattened and the incisive foramina are 
located slightly anteriorly to the canine. The parastyle and 
mesostyle are well developed and bigger than the metastyle 
on both P2 and P3. In the M1 the parastyle is absent. The 
lingual sides of the anterofossae and posterofossae have 
poorly developed plis, except for the anterofossa of the P2. 
The hypocone is oval, with a constriction that separates itself 
from the the metaloph, except on the M1. The outline of the 
protocone on the P2 is oval on its distal end, while on the P3, 
P4 and M1 it is subtriangular, with distal end more developed 
than the mesial one, differently from Hippidion, which bears 
an oval protocone. 
Measurements (mm). Mesiodistal length (MDL) of the P2: 
35,0; Labiolingual width (LLW) of the P2: 22,0; MDL of the 
P3: 23,0; LLW of the P3: 27,0; MDL of the P4: 21,0; LLW 
of the P4: 24,0; MDL of the M1: 20,0; LLW of the M1: 23,0.

Catagonus sp.
(Figure 4A)

Material. Skull (MCTFM-PV 0575a) and mandible 
(MCTFM-PV 0575b). 
Description. The skull is almost complete, with the right side 
best preserved, lacking the canine and I2, and with the I1 
broken. The left side was partially destroyed by weathering. 
In the mandible, the right ramus is well preserved, but without 
canine, incisors and m2; the posterior portion of the left 
side was destroyed by weathering. Among the diagnostic 
characteristics of the genus Catagonus are the convex dorsal 
profile of the nasal portion of the rostrum and the orbit 
posteriorly displaced some 34 mm in relation to the M3 
(Gasparini et al., 2009).

Genus Hippidion Owen, 1869

Hippidion sp.
(Figure 4D)

Material. Upper molar (M1?), (EPM-PV 0137). 
Description. The specimen consists of a partial crown of the 
tooth. The material is diagnosed as Hippidion by the presence 
of an oval-shaped protocone (Alberdi &amp;amp; Prado, 1992). The 
occlusal surface exhibits a labiolingual depression between 
the metacone and paracone. The parastyle and mesostyle are 
well developed, and the metastyle is absent. The hypocone is 
poorly developed. The tooth is longitudinally curved, concave 
on the lingual side. The distal side exhibit bioerosion traces as 
irregular sulci near the occlusal surface, possibly caused by 
plant roots or worms. Part of the enamel on the mesial side 
was lost, and the presence of longitudinal crackings suggests 
weathering.
Measurements (mm). Maximum height: 53,0; mesiodistal 
length: 27,0; labiolingual width: 29,0.
Comments on the equids. According to the review of South 
American equids by Alberdi &amp;amp; Prado (1993) and Prado 
&amp;amp; Alberdi (1994), two genera are recognized, Hippidion 
and Equus. Hippidion is represented by three species: H. 
devillei (Gervais, 1855), H. principale and H. saldiasi Roth, 

1899. Equus (Amerhippus) is represented by five species: 
E.(Amerhippus) neogaeus, E. (Amerhippus) insulatus 
C. Ameghino (in F. Ameghino 1904), E. (Amerhippus) 
santaeelenae Spillmann, 1938, E. (Amerhippus) andium 
Branco, 1883 and E. (Amerhippus) lasallei Daniel, 1948. For 
Brazil, only H. devillei, H. principale and E. (A.) neogaeus 
are referred (Alberdi et al., 2003). In RS, Hippidion was 
previously reported for Touro Passo Creek, Sanga da Cruz 
and the Continental Shelf; and E. (A.) neogaeus for Quaraí 
River, Garupá Creek, Touro Passo Creek and the continental 
shelf (Oliveira, 1992; Scherer &amp;amp; Da Rosa, 2003; Kerber &amp;amp; 
Oliveira, 2008a,b). The material here reported confirms the 
presence of these taxa in the Chuí Creek. E. (A.) neogaeus, 
the only species of Equus recorded in late Pleistocene of 
southern South America, is considered the fossil-guide of the 
Lujanian Stage/Age of the Pampean Region (Tonni, 2009). 
The equids are indicatives of open areas and grasslands 
(Alberdi &amp;amp; Prado, 1992). 

FINAL REMARKS

The remains here reported contribute to the knowledge 
of the fossil mammals from Chuí Creek. Some specimens  
are new records (Eremotherium, Myocastor, cf. Ursidae, 
Catagonus), while others confirm the presence in this area of

certain taxa that have been previously mentioned but never 
formally published, such as Antifer, Morenelaphus, Equus 
and Hippidion. This report increases the known taxonomic 
diversity of the fossil assemblage from the creek and 
contributes to a better understanding of faunal and climatic 
changes in the coastal area of southern Brazil during the Late 
Pleistocene.

The occurrence of Eremotherium increases the number 
of intertropical (Brazilian) taxa known from Chuí Creek, 
together with Protocyon troglodytes, Propraopus sulcatus, 
Pampatherium humboldti, Holmesina paulacoutoi and 
Catonyx cf. C. cuvieri (Oliveira et al., 2005; Oliveira &amp;amp; 
Pereira, 2009; Lopes &amp;amp; Pereira, 2010), besides increasing its 
distribution. The presence of Myocastor in this assemblage 
indicates the existence of perennial wet environments during 
some phase in the past, which seem to corroborate the 
interpretation that most remains were preserved and reworked 
in fluvial systems (Lopes et al., 2001; 2009). On the other 
hand, the fossil assemblage of Chuí Creek contains fossils 
of Pampean taxa  such as Doedicurus sp., Macrauchenia 
patachonica, and Lestodon sp. and also taxa that indicate 
semi-arid environments such as the Dolichotinae, Lagostomus 
cf. L. maximus, Microcavia sp. and Catagonus (Ubilla et al., 
2008; Kerber et al.,2011a; Lopes, in press).

Besides southern Brazil, northern Uruguay and the 
Mesopotamian region of Argentina have also shown a 
similar faunal composition during the Late Pleistocene, 
characterized by the co-occurrence of taxa of Pampean and 
Brazilian affinities. This pattern has been pointed by several 
authors (e.g. Oliveira, 1996; 1999; Carlini et al., 2004; Ubilla 
et al., 2004; Gasparini &amp;amp; Zurita, 2005; Kerber &amp;amp; Oliveira, 
2008a; Ferrero &amp;amp; Noriega, 2009; Oliveira &amp;amp; Kerber, 2009; 
Oliveira &amp;amp; Pereira, 2009) and is likely to be caused by the 
latitudinal displacement of climatic belts and corresponding 
environments, correlated to glacial-interglacial cycles. Several 
pollinical studies show that cold-tolerant vegetation found 
today in southern Brazil migrated up to 750 km northwards 
during the last glacial maximum (LGM), which probably also 
occurred during past glacials (Lopes, in press). It is likely 
that Pampean taxa followed these latitudinal migrations, 
thus reaching areas to the north of the Pampean Region. The 
presence of intertropical taxa in southern Brazil, Uruguay and 
Argentina permit to suggest that the opposite also occurred, 
with southwards migration of warmer climates, either during 
full interglacials but also during interstadials. Tapirids, for 
example, appear in the fossil record of the Pampean Region 
during the Ensenadan Stage / Age, between ~2 myr and ~780 
kyr BP (Cione &amp;amp; Tonni, 1999), but their current distribution 
is much farther to the north.

One major problem that hampered the bio- and 
chronostratigraphic correlations of the Pleistocene faunas of 
the region is the lack of absolute ages for most deposits. Lopes 
et al. (2010) published dating between 226 kyr and 34 kyr BP 
for the assemblage of Chuí Creek obtained by electron spin 
resonance (ESR) datings on teeth. These ages indicate that the 
fauna encompasses the final part of an interglacial, correlated 
to marine isotope stage (MIS) 7, two interglacials (MIS 5 and 

3) and two glacials (MIS 6 and 4). Taking into account these 
datings, it seems reasonable to argue that the intertropical 
fauna may have reached the area of Chuí Creek during the 
climatic optimum of MIS 5 (Eeemian stage, between 131 and 
114 kyr BP) or during one of warmer climate fluctuations 
(interstadials) of MIS 3.

Besides the lacking of absolute datings, another problem 
for a batter understanding of paleoenvironmental and 
paleoclimatic conditions at Chuí Creek is the fact that most 
remains have been reworked due to erosion of the banks 
by fluvial activities. Geological and taphonomic studies in 
Chuí Creek indicate that the fossiliferous level represents 
meandering fluvial systems that have reworked most of the 
remains, thus removing them from their original stratigraphic 
setting. Nevertheless, the stratigraphic successions exposed 
along the banks of the creek seem to indicate environmental 
modifications related to the climatic changes during Late 
Pleistocene. Until now, no mammalian remains, but only 
traces of plant roots have been found so far above the ~1 
meter-thick fossiliferous horizon. The absence of vertebrate 
remains, the high silt content and the presence of carbonate 
nodules and concretions in some points along the banks, seem 
to indicate that the climate changed to more dry and arid 
conditions, which may have contributed to the disappearance 
of large mammals in the area.

The continuous research efforts in this area, focusing on 
stratigraphy, fossil collecting, mineralogical and palynological 
analyses, are likely to provide new information regarding the 
mammalian community from southernmost Brazil permitting 
to establish comparisons with other fossil localities in order 
to understand the responses of this community to the climatic 
changes in the late Pleistocene.
