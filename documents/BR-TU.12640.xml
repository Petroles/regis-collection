ABSTRACT
Rock art researches in Tanzania have concentrated in regions known since pre- and postcolonial eras. These include central, north-central and Lake Victoria Basin (LVB). In LVB, the focuses of rock art researches have been in Bukoba (Kagera) and Mwanza regions. Recently, such researches have been expanded to Mara region. Many of these pre- and postcolonial rock art studies are devoid of recent digital techniques to record, document and analyze the paintings. In order to correct the geographic imbalances in rock art researches, this study was conducted in a recently defined region of Simiyu in LVB. This study area was selected for survey, recording and documentation following brief reports by game rangers about the possible existences of rock paintings in Maswa Game Reserve (GR), Makao Wildlife Managed Area (WMA), Mwiba Ranch and nearby areas. The study was conducted for three weeks. Methodologically, the study combined use of informants and traditional archaeological surveys in recovering the sites. A total of four sites were recorded and documented. Given time, logistic and financial constraints, the use of informants proved to be the most productive method that yielded three of the four rock art sites. These rock sites include Kijashu in Maswa GR, Gululu in Mwiba Ranch, Nyungu in Makao WMA and Butimba in nearby village of Sungu. The study shows that Simiyu region contains rock paintings that belong to three major rock art traditions (see Mabulla and Gidna 2014). These include Hunter-Forager, Red Geometric (H-F, RG) Art tradition occurring at Kijashu and Nyungu rock art sites, Bantu-Language Speaker Art tradition at Butimba site and Maasai Olpul Art tradition occurring at Gululu site. The later is historic while the former are prehistoric. Of the two prehistoric rock art traditions, H-F, RG is considered the oldest (Masao 1979; Anati 1986; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). At Kijashu and Nyungu, the H-F, RG paintings are characterized by concentric circles with externally radiating rays, circles with externally radiating lines or “sun-like” designs, circles and semi-circles with internally vertical lines, bands of lines arranged in row, “stick” human figures, wild animals, birds, and reptiles. These are painted in monochrome and in fine lines possibly using brushes. Moreover, they are depicted in semi-naturalistic and stylized styles and in shades of dusky-red, light red and orange colours. The Bantu-Language Speaker Art is represented by geometric designs, reptiles and stylized human figures and/or cattle brands. These are crudely painted in monochrome using fingers and all in dirty-white colour. The Maasai ‘Olpul’ Art tradition is represented by semi-naturalistic human figures, wild animals, domestic animals and weapons. These are painted in monochrome and biochrome shades of dusky-red and black colours. Detailed analysis of Kijashu site using ImageJ (DStretch Plugin) and Photoshop C5 identified four phases of painting. The first is represented by concentric circles with externally radiating lines, few wild animals, 20 small human figures and three human figures that are interpreted to represent a family (father, mother and child), all in dusky-red colour. The second phase is represented by the majority of wild animals and birds, all in light-red colour. The third phase is represented by abundant “stick” human figures some of which are attenuated and others in forward-bending positions, all in light-red colour. The last painting phase is represented geometric designs, all in orange colour. The long-range survival and sustainability of the sites and paintings are threatened by both anthropogenic, physical and biological agents. The states of preservation of the sites and paintings range from fair, good to very good. Accordingly, some these sites are suitable for public displays and archaeo-tourism. Nonetheless, this study calls for the establishment of site management plans and training of heritage guides before they are opened for public displays and archaeo-tourism. Also, the study recommends integrating the local communities in the management and displays of the sites and that the local communities should benefit from the accrued
revenues from archaeo-tourism. Lastly, the study recommends conducting fresh researches to record, document and analyze old and new rock art sites and paintings using the available state of the art digital techniques.
RESUMÉ
Os estudos de arte rupestre na Tanzânia têm-se concentrado em regiões conhecidas desde os períodos pré e pós-coloniais. Estas incluem o centro, o centro-norte e a zona da Bacia do Lago Victoria (BLV). Na BLV, os estudos de arte rupestre têm-se concentrado nas regiões de Bukoba (Kagera) e Mwanza. Recentemente estes estudos têm-se expandido para a região de Mara. Muitos dos trabalhos de investigação da arte rupestre pré e pós-colonial, estão desprovidos das recentes técnicas digitais de documentação e análise de pinturas. De modo a corrigir os desequilíbrios geográficos nos trabalhos de investigação da arte rupestre, este estudo foi realizado na região recentemente definida de Simiyu na BLV. Esta região foi definida após relatos dos vigilantes das reservas de Maswa Game Reserve (GR), Makao Wildlife Managed Area (WMA), Mwiba Ranch e áreas adjacentes, indicarem a possibilidade da existência de pinturas rupestres nestas zonas. Os trabalhos decorreram ao longo de três semanas. Como metodologia para localizar os sítios, recorreu-se à ajuda dos vigilantes das reservas juntamente com os métodos tradicionais de prospeção arqueológica. No total, foram registados e documentados quatro sítios com arte rupestre. Dada a existência de limitações financeiras, logísticas e de tempo, o uso dos vigilantes revelou-se como o método mais eficaz já que com a sua ajuda foi possível localizar três dos quatro sítios. Estes sítios são: Kijashu na Maswa GR, Gululu no Mwiba Ranch, Nyungu na Makao WMA e Butimba na aldeia de Sungu. O estudo realizado permitiu verificar que a região de Simiyu tem pinturas rupestres que pertencem a três grandes estilos de arte rupestre (ver Mabulla and Gidna, 2014). Estas incluem o estilo Caçador-Recolector, Geometria Vermelha (C-R, GV) que está patente nos sítios de arte rupestre de Kijashu e Nyungu, o estilo Língua Falada Bantu, no sítio de Butimba e o estilo Maasai Olpul no sítio de Gululu. O último estilo é considerado histórico, enquanto os dois primeiros são pré-históricos. Dos dois estilos de arte rupestre pré-histórica, C-R, GV é considerado como sendo o mais velho (Masao, 1979; Anati, 1986; Mabulla and Gidna, 2014). Em Kijashu e Nyungu, as pinturas C-R, GV caracterizam-se por ter círculos concêntricos com raios radiais exteriores, figuras do tipo soliformes, círculos e semicírculos com linhas verticais internas, grupos de linhas em fila, figuras humanas em “palito”, animais selvagens, aves e répteis. Os círculos estão pintados em tons monocromáticos e desenhados com linhas finas feitas possivelmente com recurso a pinceis. Além disso, estão representados de forma semi naturalística, em estilos estilizados e em tons de vermelho escuro, vermelho claro e tons cor-de-laranja. A arte do estilo Língua Falada Bantu é representada por desenhos geométricos, repteis e figuras humanas estilizadas e/ou marcas de gado. Estas representações são pintadas de forma grosseira em tons monocromáticos de branco-sujo usando os dedos. A arte Maasai ‘Olpul’ é representada por figuras humanas desenhadas de forma semi naturalística, animais selvagens, animais domésticos e armas. Estas figuras são pintadas com recurso a tons monocromáticos e bio cromáticos de vermelho escuro e preto. Uma análise detalhada das pinturas do sítio de Kijashu com recurso aos programas ImageJ (DStretch Plugin) e Photoshop C5 permitiu identificar quatro fases de pintura. A primeira é representada por círculos concêntricos com linhas externas radiais, alguns animais selvagens, 20 pequenas figuras humanas e três figuras humanas que foram identificadas como representando uma família (pai-mãe-criança), todos pintados em cor vermelha escura. A segunda fase é representada na sua maioria por animais selvagens e aves, todos em tons de vermelho claro. A terceira fase é representada por muitas figuras humanas em forma de “palito” algumas das quais atenuadas e outras em posição de inclinação para a frente, pintadas em tons vermelho claro. A última fase de pintura é representada por desenhos geométricos pintados a cor de laranja. A sobrevivência a longo prazo e a sustentabilidade dos sítios e das pinturas identificadas é ameaçada por fatores antropogénicos, físicos e biológicos.
Os estados de preservação das pinturas variam entre o razoável, o bom e o muito bom. Desta forma alguns destes sítios são visitáveis e podem ser inseridos em projetos de arqueo turismo. No entanto e antes dos sítios referenciados serem abertos ao público, aponta-se para a necessidade da criação de planos de gestão patrimonial bem com a criação de programas de treino para formar guias turísticos adaptados à realidade destes sítios de arte rupestre O estudo também recomenda a integração das comunidades locais na gestão destes sítios arqueológicos sendo que estas comunidades também devem de beneficiar das receitas geradas pelo arqueo turismo. Por último também se recomenda que sejam realizadas novas campanhas de investigação para registar e documentar os velhos e novos sítios de arte rupestre com recurso às novas técnicas digitais.

CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY
1.0 Background to the Study
In this dissertation, rock art refers to paintings or pictographs and engravings or petroglyphs made on rocks. The paintings and engravings are among the oldest forms of graphic art and examples of rock art to be found on every continent of the World, except Antarctica (Willcox 1984: 4). The majority of the paintings are on the surfaces of rock shelters whereas the engravings mostly are carved, incised or pecked into rock surfaces or boulders. According to Nooter (1986), painting and engraving techniques were not commonly employed at the same site, arguing that, an entire rock art zone may contain just one of these techniques. This implies that a group of painters in a particular zone may not have the knowledge of engraving and vice versa. However, Willcox (1966: 48) argues that the same people-might have mastered both skills but made use of them under different circumstances, at different places, and on different kind of surfaces.
Unlike other archaeological and paleontological data, rock art tells humanity’s preoccupations of daily life from hunters and gatherers to, farmers, metal workers and protoliterate populations (Anati 2004). The depictions reveal individuals and the social needs of communities, and conceptual and communicative motivations on stages of development (Anati 2004). Rock art further tells more about all aspects of humanity, such as, knowledge, art, imagination and religion. Recent research indicates that the beginning of rock art on every continent goes back further in time than it was believed before (Anati 2004). As observed by Renfrew (2008) the tradition of painting and engraving pictures on natural rock surfaces and objects by prehistoric people in the areas they lived spread all over the World from about 40,000 years ago.
Prehistoric art in Europe is distributed in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, England, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Most of the rock art sites in Europe are found in caves, for instance, the Lascaux, Gruta de Chauvet, Gruta de Niaux, Ariege Pirineus, Gruta de Rouffinac, Altamira and much more. These sites are famous not only in Europe, but all across the World due to the information they carry. The discovery of painted bisons at Altamira in Spain in 1879, stimulated investigations of rock art in other parts of the World, especially Africa, Australia and North America. For many years researchers from Europe and
elsewhere believed prehistoric art in Europe was only concentrated in caves. The discovery of first open-air engravings in Mazouco, Portugal implied that rock art in Europe could also be preserved out of caves or rock shelters (Aubry et al., 2010). The discovery of this site was followed with major discoveries of other open-air sites in the Iberian regions as well as southern France. In Spain, the engravings were found in the Spanish sector of the Douro drainage basin, at the Siega Verde (Balbin Behrmann et al., 1991 in Aubry et al., 2010) and in the Spanish Guadiana watersheds at Molino Manzanes (Collado 2009 in Aubry et al., 2010). A lot of engravings were found in the lower valley of the Côa and Sabor rivers (Aubry et al., 2010), along the Ocreza and the Zêzere Rivers and along the right margin tributaries of the Tagus River in Portugal. The engravings of the Côa valley were discovered in 1994 during the construction of a dam, a project that was later abandoned. Up to date more than 62 sites have been recorded in Côa and Sabor rivers (www.arte-coa.pt). The discovery of these open-air sites have contributed to the new ideological and perspectives regarding the Paleolithic art of Europe.
Africa is said to be the continent with the most rock art sites and diversified rock art traditions (Coulson and Campbell 2001). The rock paintings in Africa are found at three types of sites: on straight-faced overhangs, on shelters, and in shallow caves (Masao 1976). In Africa, at least three broad areas with dense rock art sites can be identified. These are the Sahara and neighboring regions, Southern Africa and Eastern Africa (Coulson and Campbell 2001; Campbell 2007). Currently the oldest date for rock art comes from Africa, at Blombos cave, South Africa. Thirteen pieces of incised ochre have been recovered from archaeological deposits ca. 75,000-100,000 years ago (Henshilwood et al., 2009). Previous studies indicated that the oldest date came from Apollo 11 cave in Namibia dated to about 27,000 BP (Anati 2004). Other studies thought that the earliest rock art came from Kondoa, Tanzania dated to over 40,000 BP (Anati 1986, 2004). Recent studies and re-dating of the Bed V of Mumba rock shelter show that at this shelter, rock art may have been practiced since 60,000 years ago (Mehlman 1989; Prendergast et al., 2007; Gliganic, et al., 2012). Although findings from Africa have improved our understanding of African rock art system, still dating is inconsistent and relative.
Tanzania is endowed with the largest concentration of known rock art with different styles and affinities in eastern and central Africa (Mabulla 2005; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Rock
paintings of Bukoba were the first to be reported in Tanzania as far back as 1908 while those of central Tanzania were reported in 1923 (Culwick 1931; Leakey 1936; Mturi 1998; Bwasiri 2008). Colonial administrators and officials discovered the paintings. In Tanzania, rock art sites are concentrated in central Tanzania especially in Kondoa, Mpwapwa, Manyoni and Iramba districts in Dodoma and Singida regions respectively (Culwick 1931; Fosbrooke 1950; Fozzard 1966; Masao 1974, 1976, 2007; Ten Raa 1974; Leakey 1983; Anati 1986; Lim 1992; Bwasiri 2008; Mahudi 2008). Majority of paintings in this zone are attributed to the hunter foragers dominated by both big and small mammals, reptiles and anthropomorphic figures in scenes such as hunting, dancing, running, fighting and herding. These areas have received most of rock art research in Tanzania since pre-independence to the present.
The other zone with dense concentrations of rock art is the north-central Tanzania, particularly, in Ngorongoro, Karatu, Mbulu, Babati and Hanang districts in Arusha and Manyara regions respectively. This area has received some attentions recently (Masao 2007; Bendera 2011; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). The project led by Audax Mabulla and Bushozi documented to about 15 rock art sites between July-August 2007. In 2008, Audax Mabulla and Agness Gidna documented more rock art sites in Duru and Ufana areas in Babati and Hanang districts respectively. Archaeological survey in 2009 at Endadu hills, Gideware village, Bashnet Division in Babati District, Manyara Region also discovered and documented two new rock art sites to the previously surveyed. This was part of a Field School training of the Department of Archaeology and Heritage, University of Dar es Salaam. The results of this rock art documentation are publications of scientific articles and various B. A. and M. A. Dissertations as shown earlier.
Until recently, southern highlands were only known for the late Acheulian occurrences, particularly, at Isimila. Nonetheless, recent researches in Iringa by Canadians and Tanzanian archaeologists have discovered a range of archaeological sites including painted rock shelters (Biittner, 2011 and Bushozi 2011, 2012 and Willoughby 2009, 2012 in Itambu 2013). Even though this research team reported six rock art sites, there was no detailed study directed towards rock art sites until in 2012 (see Itambu 2013). In 2012 Makarius P Itambu recorded, mapped and documented two new rock art sites that are Lutona and Tavimienda rockshelters. He also studied in detail the previously reported sites of Kihessakilolo and Mlambalasi Hill. Zoomorphic (animal) figures, reptiles and insects, anthropomorphic figures, equipments or paraphernalia, geometric and script-like designs and indeterminate/non-
representational paintings (abstract) are the subject matter compositions of Iringa rock art (Itambu 2013). His study showed that rock shelters are still socially and culturally attached to human survival and are still in use for ritual purposes. This study has bridged a gap in our understanding on rock art of southern highlands.
Research in Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) have been conducted in Kagera, Mwanza and Mara in Tanzania, Nyanza in Kenya and some parts of Rwanda and Uganda (Taner 1953; Soper and Golden 1969; Odner 1971; Chaplin 1974; Masao 1991b; Mabulla 2005; Chami 2008; Namono 2010). The Kagera region, which is located along the western shore of Lake Victoria, is the richest area with rock paintings compared to Mwanza and Mara regions (Mabulla 2005). Most of the rock art studies around LVB on the side of Tanzania have been conducted in 1970's especially, in Kagera and Mwanza regions. The Mara Regional Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (MRARP) of 2002 financially supported by the British Institute in Eastern Africa recorded for the first time nine rock art sites composed of fourteen-painted rock shelters and overhangs. Before then this area was archaeologically unknown. However more survey can result to the discovery of more rock art sites in this region. Hunter-foragers red geometric tradition characterizes the rock art of Mara. Uterus-like oval, circles, concentric circles with externally radiating lines, semi circles, dots, divided circles, ladders, lines and sets of parallel lines are hallmark of the tradition (Mabulla, 2005). Despite a lot of research on rock art being conducted around the Lake Victoria Basin (Kagera, Mwanza, and Mara regions on the side of Tanzania), yet no study has been conducted in Simiyu region, which also occurs in LVB. Recently, some rock shelters with paintings and stratified archaeological deposits were reported in this region by wildlife rangers (AZP Mabulla, pers. communication 2013). Therefore, this region if well studied it has the potential to contribute to our existing knowledge about prehistoric art in Tanzania.
1.1	Statement of the Research Problem
Rock art has remained in situ in many regions across the globe. About more than 70,000 sites of rock paintings and engravings are known throughout the World with over 45 million images and signs recorded (Anati 2004). Despite a lot of efforts, which still continues from rock art researchers and experts, only a fraction of the World's rock art has been studied and documented. In this respect, more rock art studies should be conceived and conducted.
In Tanzania, there are about 1,000 rock art sites with different styles, affinities and periods (Coulson 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Despite Tanzania having rich and diversified rock art, the majority of them have not been documented and studied fully. Most parts (more than 90%) of Tanzania remain unknown archaeologically. This is due to few rock art experts, insufficient fund to carry eXtensive and intensive research and inaccessibility of many parts of the country. Most of our knowledge about the rock art of Tanzania comes from central Tanzania, especially, Kondoa, Mpwapwa, Manyoni and Iramba districts in Dodoma and Singida regions, north-central and LVB as noted earlier. It is clear that most of the rock art researches in Tanzania have concentrated to areas that are known to have rock art since colonial times. Little efforts have been undertaken to explore new territories like in this study. Based on the report of the existence of rock art in Simiyu region by wildlife rangers, this project was designed to investigate and document the existence of rock art sites in the area. Being in the LVB, I assumed that rock art practices were widespread in the region and therefore, I expected to find rock art sites in Simiyu region.
1.2	Objectives of the Study
1.2.1	General objective
The main objective of this study was to investigate and document the rock art of Simiyu region, Lake Victoria Basin.
1.2.2	Specific objectives
i.	To survey and document the rock painting sites.
ii.	To study, analyze, and identify the images depicted, styles and rock art tradition of the sites.
iii.	To evaluate the state of rock art sites and paintings and identify threats for their the long-range survival.
iv.	To assess the potentials of the rock art sites for archaeo-tourism.
1.3	Hypotheses and Test Implications
Rock art studies in Lake Victoria Basin have shown that the rock paintings of the region broadly share some styles and affinities. Generally, they belong to the hunter-forager red geometric (H-F, RG) (Mabulla 2005; Mabulla and Gidna, 2014) or Twa (Smith 1995) tradition. Yet, some differences have also been noticed, especially, the Bukoba rock art that are interpreted as cattle brands (Chaplin 1974) and as script-like (Chami 2008). The
similarities and differences have been observed in terms of subject matters, colour types and artistic styles as well as the rock art tradition. This study developed two hypotheses and two test implications to investigate the rock art and archaeology of Simiyu region, which occurs in the Lake Victoria Basin.
Null Hypothesis:
The rock art of Simiyu region does not share characteristics with those from other regions of the Lake Victoria Basin.
Test Implication:
The researcher expected to find that the subject matters, colour types, artistic styles and the rock art tradition of Simiyu region to be different and to belong to other areas with rock paintings, especially those of north-central Tanzania.
Alternative Hypothesis:
The rock art of Simiyu region share similarities with those from other regions of the Lake Victoria Basin.
Test Implication:
The researcher expected to find that the subject matters, colour types, artistic styles, and the rock tradition to belong to those observed in other regions of Lake Victoria Basin.
1.4	Significance of the Study
Since pre-independence period rock art researches in Tanzania have concentrated much in central regions, Dodoma and Singida. As discussed previously, LVB is the second area with concentration of rock art sites and some researches have been conducted in the area. Mwanza, Kagera and Mara regions have received some attentions. This study has documented sites in Simiyu region with rock paintings. Hence this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge of rock art in Tanzania in particular, and the World in general. The results of this study inform not only the academic communities but also other stakeholders in rock art studies. In addition, the researcher evaluated the state of the paintings and their potential for archaeo-tourism. Therefore, this study might contribute to the management and conservation of the paintings and their potential use for socio-economic activities. This has the potential for improving the local economy.

CHAPTER TWO RESEARCH AREA'S PROFILE
2.0 Introduction
This chapter gives an overview description of the study area to include its geographical location and administrative units, geological setting, climate, soils, topography and vegetation. It also describes the land use system, socio-economic activities and demographic characteristics of the study area.
2.1	Geographical location and Administrative units
This study was conducted in Meatu district in Simiyu region. Simiyu region was officially inaugurated in March 2012. The region is situated in northeastern part of Tanzania, south east of Lake Victoria at about 2° 57' 00” Southern Latitude and 34° 12' 00” Eastern Longitude (Figure 1). Meatu district has an area of 8,835 km2 of which, about half, 4,582 km2, is agricultural and pastoral land (MRDCO, 2010). The elevation ranges between 1,000-1,400 m above sea level (Meertens et al., 1995). In the north the region borders Mara region, to the east Arusha region, to the south Tabora and Mwanza to the west. In south-east the region borders Singida regions and to the south west Shinyanga. The region is subdivided into five districts. The districts are Bariadi, Maswa, Meatu, Itilima and Busega. Bariadi, Maswa and Meatu districts formerly belonged to the region of Shinyanga. Itilima and Busega are the newly districts created prior to the inauguration of the region.

2.2	Geological Setting
2.2.1	The overview geology of Tanzania
Tanzania is dominated mainly by Archean and Proterozoic rocks exhibiting ages of greater than two billion years (&gt;2,000 Ma). The Archaean rocks form the Tanzania Craton, a
component of the African Plate, one of the world's largest slabs of continental crust. The country being situated in the southern part of east African rift systems there are many mechanisms for rifting and the tectonic history of rifting is quite complex (Dawson 2008). On regional scales four major tectonic provinces have been recognized: the western system (Ubendian system), central system (Tanzanian Craton partial covered by Dodoma system), mobile Usagaran system and eastern continental and marine sedimentary rocks of Lower Jurassic to Quaternary (Bell and Dodson 1981; Schluter 1997; Lupogo 2013; Figure 2, Table 1 and 2). The stable Tanzania craton consists of Archean rocks which are granitic complexes, Dodoma system and greenstone belt. The eastern extension of this underlies Mozambique belt contained deformed metasedimentary rocks and intrusions. Folds and thrusts verging eastward from the orogenic belt characterize this area. The same characteristics are obtained in Ubendian system. Ubendian system comprises of high-grade metamorphic rocks of sedimentary and igneous origin. The rocks include granulite, amphibolite, migmatite, gneiss, schist, quartzites and marble. The metamorphic grade of Ubendian system is mainly amphibolite or granulite facies. The Usagaran system contains rocks of Paleoproterozic age that were deposited in geosynclinals troughs. The Usagaran system comprises sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks. In the coast regions and in the parts of the rift, the Mesozoic rocks occur. The Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are alternating transgressive and regressive sequence. The rocks comprises of sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, coral limestones and silty shales. The Cenozoic period consist of sediments and volcanic eruption occurred in several parts of Tanzania. The Neogene volcanic which most occur within East African rift valley overlie Precambrian rocks in the southwest and northeastern part of the country. The quaternary period is characterized by deposition and erosion cycles related to mainly sea level, climate changes and tectonics.

2.2.2	Regional geology
The geology of Simiyu region is dominated by Precambrian rocks situated on the Tanzania Craton and is mainly composed of Archean granitoids and metasediments, along with the rocks of Nyanzian system (Saggerson 1967; Figure 3). The rocks of the Nyanzian system are typically developed in the area around Lake Victoria. The system is associated with the intrusive gold bearing granites. A period of folding and intrusion due to tectonic activities during the period of orogeny uplifted part of the landscape to form broad and/or narrow valleys interrupted by rocky hills. These exposed hills consist mainly granitic and sometimes gneissic rocks. There are also some huge plains which developed on old alluvium (lacustrine) or colluvium derived from granitic and gneissic rocks. Catenas (soil sequences from hill tops to valley bottoms) have developed due to natural soil-forming processes on the predominantly granite parent material. Even in slightly undulating areas several soil types can be distinguished in the toposequence. Granite hills (shelters and overhangs) which are resistant to erosion formed readymade canvases for rock painters. Hadza hunter-gatherers who are among the oldest indigenous of Tanzania and the most likely authors of early paintings in central and north-central Tanzania (Masao 1976; Mabulla 1996; Mabulla 2007) still inhabit some of these rock shelters.

2.3	Climatic Features
The region has a tropical type of climate with clearly distinguished rainy and dry seasons.
According to meteorological statistics, the average temperature for the region is about 28° C.
The region experiences minimum rainfall of 600 mm and maximum of 1,000 mm per year.
The rainy season usually starts between mid-October and December and ends in the second week of May. These rains have two peak seasons. The first peak is the short rains (Vuli), falls between mid-October and December, while the second one, the long season (Masika), falls between February and mid- May. The whole rainy season covers a total of almost six months, with a dry spell, which usually occurs in January and February. The dry season begins in mid-May and ends in mid-October. This is a period of about five months. During such period the soils become very dry and hard to cultivate and pastures become very poor in quality and quantity. The availability of water for domestic use and livestock also becomes an acute problem. The understanding of climate of the study area is important in designing conservation, preservation and protection plans of the rock art sites. In addition, in promoting archaeo-tourism the aspect of climatic related factors have to be considered when planning ways to bring visitors to the sites.
2.4	Soil and Vegetation
On hilltops, soils are moderately well drained greyish brown and sandy (ferric acrisols and oxisols). Moderately deep well drained, greyish brown sand loams (ferric luvisols) occur on the slopes. On low-lying bottom lands, are the poorly drained black cotton clays (cambisols and vertisols). Climate (rainfall and temperature), soil, anthropogenic activities and wildlife determine the natural vegetation of the study area. The vegetation cover of the area is dominated by perennial grasses and some scattered shrubs (Acacia fischeri, Acacia mellifera, Commiphora campestris, Lannea humilis). Also present are bushlands with shrubs like Acacia drepanolobium, and Acacia spirocarpa. In addition trees like baobab (Adansonia digitata), tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and fig (Ficus sonderi or Ficus nigropunctata) are found in the region. Depiction of vegetation in rock paintings is very rare in Tanzania. Nevertheless fruits, tubers, nuts, seeds and other plant foods may have formed an important component of the painter's diet (Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Although it's very hard to identify the kinds of vegetation in rock paintings, understanding of the vegetation around the study area may be potential during the interpretation.
2.5	Human Population and Ethnicity
According to the Tanzania Population and Housing Census (2012), the region has a total population of 1,584,157 people of which 824,266 are women and 759,891 are men. The household size amounts to 6.9 people. The average annual population growth rate according
to the 2002 and 2012 censuses is 1.8. The population by districts in Simiyu region is depicted in Table 3.
The major ethic group is the Wasukuma who are both agriculturist and livestock keepers. There are also substantial numbers of Wanyiramba, Wataturu and Wahadzabe from neighbouring regions who have settled in Meatu district. It is important to understand the ethnic groups inhabiting the area because some have been regarded as responsible for the art. For example Wasandawe and Hadza are considered likely to be the authors of the early rock art of central Tanzania (Masao 1976). Also rock art in South Africa and many regions of southern Africa are attributed to Bushmen hunter-gatherers. Also some objects depicted in rock art have been ethnographically proven to still be used by some extant ethnic groups (see Masao 1976; Mturi 1998, 2001, Mabulla 2005).

Recent studies have shown that some rock shelters with paintings continue to be used by extant humans for ritual ceremonies, sleeping, refuge, etc. (see, Mabulla 1996, 2007; Bwasiri 2011; Itambu 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Mabulla and Gidna (2014) reported that, the paintings in the Olpul Art tradition were painted by moranis during or after the Olpul ceremony. Painted are the animals consumed and encountered, weapons like shields and spears, cattle brands and cattle bells and humans. Itambu (2013) compared the script/letter like-signs patterns or symbols represented in the Iringa rock paintings with symbolic signs painted on ceremonial gourds of the Nyaturu people of central Tanzania. His analysis indicated that the script/letter like-signs are similar to those depicted on ceremonial gourds of
the Nyaturu people of central Tanzania (Figure 4). Hence ethnographic objects and ritual ceremonies made by present ethnic groups can form a linkage between the past and the
present.

2.6	Social Economic Activities
The types of economic activities carried out in the region are dependent of climate and the existing natural resource base. Agriculture is the dominant socio-economic activity of Simiyu inhabitants followed by livestock keeping. More than 90% of the region's population lives in rural areas practicing agro-pastoralism. Gender, norms, customs, individual wealth and access to resources have to a large extent influenced economic activities in the region. The activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry that earns most income benefit only men in the society. This is due to gender differences and traditional imbalance in the ownership and control of resources.
Subsistence farming for food and cash crops, as well as livestock keeping rank high as the main occupations in the region. Cotton and tobacco are the main cash crops while sorghum and maize are the staple crops. In addition, crops such as paddy rice, sweet potatoes, cassava, beans, finger millets and groundnuts are cultivated on varying scales. Other activities for the
people in the region include: casual labour, petty trading, beekeeping, lumbering and charcoal making and formal employment for government staffs working in towns and villages.
As shown earlier, it is clear that the livelihoods of people in the region depend on climate and natural resources for their sustainability. As such the ongoing climate change is really having significant impacts to the region's societies who depend entirely on natural resources (Adger 2006; IUCN 2008; Amruta 2009; Lyimo and Kangalawe 2010). Studies have indicated that societies with fewer resources to adapt, lower adaptive capabilities, growing population and lower technological capabilities are highly impacted. Simiyu region and the community are at risk without further intervention. Hence this study discusses the potential of rock art sites in promoting archaeo-tourism as a new form of economy to support the livelihoods of the communities surrounding rock art sites and the region at large.
2.7	Natural Resource
Abundant natural resources and biodiversity in Simiyu region contribute immensely to the region's economy and employment opportunities. The region has one game reserve and game controlled area both in Meatu district. Maswa Game Reserve (GR) borders the Serengeti National Park covering an area of 2,880 square kilometers. Makao Wildlife Management Area (WMA) covers an area of 1,330 square kilometers. A wide variety of wildlife can be found within these game conservation areas such as hippo, lion, zebra, buffalo, wild dog, bushbuck, impala, giraffe and baboon. The fairly large wildlife areas in the region with a diversity of wildlife species already attract a fair number of tourists. Most of the surveyed and documented rock art sites occur within these game reserves. There is the possibility that the varieties of depicted animals in these sites are evidence of the type of environments and resources that were available within the ecosystem. The rock art painters could have exploited such available natural resources. Therefore this information may help us to understand and compare the past and the present environment and available resources in the landscape.
CHAPTER THREE
LITERATURE REVIEW
3.0 Introduction
This chapter reviews some rock art literatures and other archaeological works conducted in LVB and Tanzania at large and linking the available information with this study. The review starts by giving general information and knowledge over the rock art of Africa. It goes further by discussing the rock art of Tanzania; its historical development, styles and techniques employed by painters in producing the art. The chapter also covers previous research and knowledge of rock art on LVB. The chapter suggests future research to consider archaeological excavation in the area so as to reconstruct the cultural chronology and occupation of the region. The study also discusses how rock art should be treated as other archaeological record. Finally the chapter reviews theories used in interpretation of rock art and emphasizes that the location and distribution of rock art sites within the landscape are important in our understanding of the context in which the art was made and used.
3.1	Rock Art Distribution in Africa
Africa is rich in rock art sites and the continent has the largest concentration of rock art sites in the World (Coulson and Campbell 2001). The zones of rock art are scattered from the very north to the very south of the continent (Masao 1979; Campbell 2007; Figure 5). According to Rudner and Rudner (1970 in Masao 1976), the African rock art is divided into two groups. Firstly, is the northern or Saharan group is found in north of latitude 16° N in the Sahara Belt from the Atlantic to the Red sea. Most of the art in this area consists of petroglyphs on rock outcrops; while the paintings are concentrated in the mountainous rocky massifs such as the Atlas, the Tassili, the Fezzan, the Tibesti and the Uweinat (see Masao 1979). Secondly, is the southern Africa, south of latitude 8° S and consists mainly of paintings and petroglyphs on the Central Plateau (see Masao 1979). Eastern Africa is also endowed with a lot of rock art sites, however, incomparable to northern or southern group. In this group, paintings occur in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eretria, Djibouti, Somalia and Madagascar (Coulson and Campbell 2001; Campbell 2007; Masao 1976; Rosolondrainy 2012). In his study, Masao (1976) commented that in the forest belt of west and central Africa there are no rock art. However, currently a number of rock art sites in this zone have been reported. In Bizdal village, northern Cameroon, rock paintings and engravings have been recorded (Marliac 1982). In east, north, and south of Angola rock paintings and engravings have also been
documented (Martins 2008). Nonetheless rock art sites from other regions from these zones have yet not been reported. This is due to a number of problems among others is lack of research, lack of suitable rocks in other areas and poor conditions than discontinuity in their distribution (Mabulla 2005; Campbell 2007). Inaccessibility of many parts of the continent due to rough terrain and poor travel infrastructures are other factors for less documentation of rock art in other parts of the continent (Mabulla and Gidna 2014).

3.2	Rock Art of Tanzania: History and Development
In Tanzania as it was in other African countries, the genesis of rock paintings coincided along with the period of exploration and colonial expansion (Lewis-Williams 2006: 306). Much of documentation of rock art in Tanzania was conducted in the process of German and British
colonialism (Leakey 1983). Colonial administrators, officials, travelers and missionaries discovered the paintings in the course of their duties (Bagshawe 1923, 1925; Culwick 1931; Aitken 1948; Fosbrooke 1950; Fozzard 1959, 1966). The first recording and documentation of rock art in Tanzania was done by Missionaries in Bwanjai, Kagera in 1908 (Mturi 1998). In 1923, Bagshawe a District Commissioner by then reported some rock-shelters with paintings in an area west of Lake Eyasi (Leakey 1983; Mturi 1998). In 1929, T. A. M. Nash published a short paper on paintings found in Kondoa District. In 1931, A. T. Culwick reported on the discovery of more sites with rock paintings in central Tanganyika.
Systematic documentation of rock art in different parts of Tanzania started in 1930s. This was marked by the work of Louis and Mary Leakey who at first visited rock shelters with paintings in Kisese and Cheke areas in Kondoa District and identified about 13 styles of rock paintings (Mturi 1998). Between 1934 and 1936, Ludwig Kohl-Larsen and his Wife Margit Kohl-Larsen conducted archaeological investigation along the Lake Eyasi Basin. Their investigation and survey resulted to the discovery and documentation of a number of rock art sites (Kohl-Larsen 1938 in Masao 1979). During 1940's Henry Foosbrooke and his wife recorded and documented about 100-rock art sites in the Maasai escarpment, Kondoa district. These earliest recording and documentations were published in a special issue of the Tanganyika Notes and Records no. 49. Yet the reports produced by these people were unscientific and did not interpret the paintings rather than describing them. However, some reports made an effort to categorize the paintings according to styles, colors and established typological descriptions. The first scholarly publication was that of Leakey L. S. B, Tanganyika Rock Paintings: A Guide and Record, produced in 1950. The guide made great achievements in presenting rock-art sites of the then Tanganyika. The guide offered few answers to the ‘‘whom,'' ‘‘when'' and ‘‘why'' of rock art. As noted by L.S. B Leakey (1950) this was the beginning of scientific rock art study in Tanzania.
Later in 1951, Louis and Mary Leakey conducted detailed systematic surveys, and documented rock-shelters with paintings in Kondoa, located on the eastern side of the Maasai escarpment. They also excavated a number of shelters with paintings, recovering materials belongs to the later Stone Age. The results of these work, however, remained unpublished until 1983. Mary Leakey henceforth produced a well-illustrated book of rock art in 1983: ‘‘Africa's Vanishing Art: The Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' from paintings recorded and documented from Kondoa district in 1950s. In this book, Mary Leakey identified four styles
leading to 17 stylistic descriptions which were by then adopted by many scholars in the description of rock paintings elsewhere.
During the post-colonial period (1965-1980), rock art research intensified, but yet, continued being directed towards the same areas previously reported by colonial agents, such as Kagera and Mwanza regions in LVB and central Tanzania in Dodoma and Singida regions (Odner 1971; Chaplin 1974; Masao 1979; Leakey 1983). Nonetheless, by this time, we began to see Tanzanians such as Dr. Fidelis T. Masao conducting rock art researches. Also in the mid 1960s and early 1980s, series of publications were made (see Inskeep 1962; Masao 1976, 1979).
Masao conducted extensive surveys on rock paintings in Mpwapwa, Kondoa, Manyoni and Iramba Districts. Masao documented rock art sites at Kwa Mwango-Isanzu and Kirumi Isumbirira in Iramba District as well as Kandaga A9 and Majilili 2B sites in Kondoa District. He recorded to about 68 rock art sites. About 30 rock paintings sites were recorded in Kondoa and 38 from Singida region. However in his study Masao only selected about half of the number for detailed study. Analysis of subject matter indicated that this was hunter art motivated either by magico-religious beliefs or mere pleasure of paintings and recording events (Masao 1979). From his study he recognized four stylistics categories, which are described in next sections. Nevertheless he concluded that the rock paintings of central Tanzania share some common features with the rock art of the Sahara and that of central/south Africa
In 1980, Anati, as UNESCO consultant visited and documented 102 rock art sites in Kondoa, Iramba, Singida urban and Singida rural district. He proposed a stylistic scheme, which categorized the rock art of Eastern Africa into four socio-economic stages: Early Hunting and Gathering; Late Hunting and Gathering; Pastoral Farming; and Mixed Economy. As far as the rock art of Tanzania is concerned, Anati (1983) identified six chrono-socio-economic styles. His scheme is both typological and chronological. It reflects the main economic activities of society concerned with art.
Imogene Lim in 1992, 1996 attempted to interpret the hunter-gatherer paintings of Usandawe by combining both the physical environment and the social context of the site using “a site-oriented approach to rock art”. The site oriented approach focused on the relationship
between the rock paintings and sites, sites and the landscape, and the landscape and the community. Lim concentrated on understanding the Sandawe beliefs and how these beliefs tied to the rock paintings. She learned that Sandawe view certain shelters and baobab trees as wombs, places were all life began, invested with supernatural powers. Only some sites hold such power and not all of these sites contain rock art. Lim also noted the importance of another trance dance (iyari) performed at these places by women when seeking to ensure rain and health in the land.
In the previous paragraphs it has been revealed that most of researches around LVB were conducted during 1950s and 1970s. Until recent few studies were conducted in 2001, 2002, 2003 (Mturi 2001; Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mabulla 2005). In the western and southern shores of the Lake Victoria rock paintings are also concentrated (Mturi 2001; Kwekason and Chami 2003). In the area, “stylized cattle” form is a dominant motif, especially in Bukoba Rural, Bukoba Urban and Muleba districts. There are also executed figures that represent lacustrine adaptations, like fishing activities, fish, canoes and/or boats (Mturi 2001). Moreover geometric figures such as circles, concentric circles, and lines belonging to Red Geometric tradition have been documented in Muleba and Bukoba rural (Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mturi and Bushozi 2002).
In 2002, the Mara Region Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (MRARP) recorded nine rock art sites composed of fourteen-painted rock shelters and overhangs in three districts of the Mara Region, LVB. It was followed by the publication of these sites by Mabulla (2005). After the inventory, analysis and classification of paintings according to their subject matters, stylistic characteristics, composition, action, aspect, techniques of execution and colour coding and clarity, Mabulla identified two traditions in this region. Majority of paintings belonged to the Red Geometric tradition like those of Bukoba area and Mwanza Gulf, and the Red Animal tradition, which has fairly large stylized paintings in red and yellowish red (Mabulla 2005). According to him the Mara Region's rock art is fascinating and informative, comprising a complex, unique and remarkably advanced form of art that signify the work of highly skilled artisans.
In 2000s researches were again directed in area of central Tanzania. We now see works from Tanzanian Masters students specializing in rock art developing projects in the field. Hiltruda Mahudi conducted a project at Matongo-Isanzu in Iramba District in 2008. Her study
investigated the use of rock art in understanding of socio-economic activities and cultural values. Results from her study revealed that rock art sites were used for habitations as well as performing of ritual activities. Hiltruda also noted that there were other activities, which could only be inferred by studying the rock art such as hunting and dancing. Another student was Emanuel James Bwasiri who conducted a study at Mongomi wa Kolo site in Kondoa District in 2008. His study provided a vision of how living heritage sites in Tanzania, particularly Mongomi wa Kolo should be managed (see Bwasiri 2008). Shortly, he called for the involvement of local community in the management programmes but also allowing Warangi and Wasi/Waragwa communities to still use Mongomi wa Kolo site for the traditional ritual ceremonies. In addition to that multiple stakeholders and institutions should be involved in planning and decision-making towards for proper management of Kondoa sites. Moreover he suggested that the cultural heritage resources should improve the economy of the local people through resource benefit and sharing. Furthermore by empowering people or their leaders in conservation and management activities their livelihood may improve. Also the income generated from heritage asset to be directed in communities' development projects.
In 2011, Ashura Bendra, another Tanzanian student did a rock art research in Babati and Hanang Districts of Manyara region. Her study was part of an on going project of documenting rock paintings of north-central Tanzania that was initiated in 1998 by Audax Mabulla, joined later by Pastory Bushozi and Agnes Gidna. Until the end of the project seven localities were surveyed. They included Suera, Aata, Matangarimo and Simbay (Hanang district), Hoshang, Kwaraa and Ufana (Babati district). A total of twenty-one rock-painting sites were recorded and documented. Humans, animals, reptiles, insects and geometric designs formed the subject matter in these sites. Human figures were dominant over the other figures, followed by animal figures, geometric designs, reptiles and insects at last.
Pamela Willoughby, Pastory Bushozi and Katherine Biittner were the first Canadians-Tanzanian researchers to report the rock art of Iringa Region in 2006. This was during their archaeological surveys in the region where archaeological occurrences including Middle Stone Age (MSA), Later Stone Age (LSA), and Iron Age sites were discovered. Based on their research objectives and other constraints no detailed study was conducted on the rock art. It was until 2012 when Makarius Peter Itambu conducted a systematic study and documentation in the area. He documented to about 10-rock art sites including the previous
reported ones. Nonetheless three sites well preserved were adopted for the careful analysis and presentation (see Itambu 2013). Upon his conclusion, Makarius calls upon more surveys and search for more rock art sites in the southern Tanzania. Basing on the geology and geomorphology of the area, he believes more shelters, overhangs and surfaces with paintings are prevailing in this zone.
Between 1998 and 2012, the project initiated by Audax Mabulla in north-central Tanzania had documented more than 250 rock art sites in this area. The most recent publication of these sites is that of Mabulla and Gidna (2014). The study shows that the rock art of this region is primarily painted, typically monochrome and usually displayed in small and large shelters and over-hangs. Amongst the paintings, the most common subjects are wild animals, human figures and geometric designs. Characteristically, one or a few panels occur, each with large number of representations that often are grouped together. In some cases these groupings present narrative scenes, of people dancing or hunting.
Most of the rock art studies in Tanzania have concentrated in surveying and documentation of sites. However, management studies of rock art should also be taken into considerations. Although survey and documentation of cultural heritage assets is considered by scholars to be the first step towards their management and conservation (Pearson and Sullivan 1995) but also they should go hand in hand with management approaches and impacting knowledge to the local stakeholders on why management of assets is crucial. In this respect Audax Mabulla (Pers. Communication 2013) is designing a project on the rock art of Singida east. The major aim of the project is to ensure the long-range survival, productivity, and contribution of rock art of Singida east to Tanzania and Global education, research, tourism, and pride in human past accomplishments. As far as preservation, conservation and management of the rock art is concerned, the project will aim at educating the communities around rock art sites about the cultural significances of the rock art and the need to be conserved and managed by them for the present and future generations.
3.3	Rock Art Distribution in Tanzania
Major concentrations of rock art sites, studies and surveys have been in Dodoma and Singida regions in central Tanzania, Lake Victoria regions of Mwanza, Kagera (Bukoba) and Mara (Musoma) (Figure 6). Also rock art sites occur in Mtwara, Kilimanjaro, Tabora, Iringa, near Lake Rukwa, Iringa. The rock art of Kondoa and those of other regions in central Tanzania
have played great role to our understanding of rock art regionally and internationally (Anati 1986; Bwasiri 2008; Culwick 1931; Fosbrooke 1950; Fozzard 1966; Leakey 1983; Lim 1992; Mahudi 2008; Masao 1974, 1979, 2007; Ten Raa 1974). The rock art of central Tanzania
have received attentions by researchers since colonial times due to their impressive and
ubiquitous nature.

3.4	Classification of Styles and Traditions
Studies of rock art styles, motifs, execution techniques and subject matter in Tanzania can be traced starting from the works of Louis Leakey (1936, 1950). Leakey came up with 17 styles of rock paintings based on a few sites investigated in Kondoa, central Tanzania. However,
Leakey's model was later criticized because it was very restrictive and site specific and did not cover many sites across the country. It was believed that the rock art in other regions might represent a large amount of stylistic attributes more than it was previously estimated (Anati 1986; Masao 1979).
Fozzard (1959) studied six rock-painting sites in the western part of Kondoa district and suggested a sequence of five styles. These were:
1.	Human figures where the body filled in with paint and the head is drawn in outline with the centre or face left blank with a combination of solid and open line styles;
2.	Open line style where animals are drawn in thin outline only. Although the animals are well shaped, the drawings are a little crude without much detail;
3.	Spot styles where shapes of animals are constructed by grouping large sports of orange vermillion paint. There is no outline in this style;
4.	The finest detailed line whereby animals are drawn in thin delicate outline with details such as manes, tails and body lines, and are lifelike and full of expressions; and;
5.	Solid where both humans and animals were drawn in a thick coat of paint.
In 1971, Knut Odner undertook recording and documentation of rock shelters with paintings in Iramba District. He came up with a new scheme that emphasized on three styles;
1.	Realistic or near realistic animals and human figures in solid red and other symbols such as geometric and amorphous figures;
2.	Schematic animals or crudely depicted human beings with white as a dominant colour, while other colours are red and yellow; and
3.	Symbols of handprints, suns and comb-like representations in white and black, sometimes red in colour.
Odner's scheme focused on chronological aspects, colours and subject matter. However, the scheme ignored to include outline drawings, which presumably should be included in naturalistic and semi-naturalistic works (Willcox 1984).
Masao (1979) made a synthesis based on Odner's and Fozzard's models that produced four complex stylistic units for the rock art of central Tanzania. These include:
1.	Stylized representation which is seen best in human figures. The whole human figure is schematized in simplistic line drawings with occasional exaggeration for anatomical parts such as the head or/and
muscle. Stylized figures are divided into (i) red thin and thick line drawings where the figure is schematized all over; (ii) red stylized sharp profile silhouettes where the whole figure (head, trunk, arms and legs) are represented by a think bold line approaching a silhouette and there is very little exaggeration of body parts; (iii) Red conventionalized schematic human and naturalistic figures filled in with animals whereby pigments varied from vermillion to scarlet red;
2.	Naturalistic representations in which many animals are portrayed in this style. Both largest terrestrial animals for instance elephant to the small creeping lizards are represented by this style as far as rock paintings of central Tanzania are concerned. In this complex many sub styles are depicted for animals than humans for example (i) simple open line outline style. The outline is normally done in fine red line, orange, brown and white; (ii) double open line style, in which the profile is done in double line outline; (iii) red boldly filled-in silhouettes, which is the most naturalistic style and the infilling is a bold wash of the same red colour; and (iv) red line outline infilled with various motifs. This style is finely executed profile outline of the animal and then infilled with different motifs in the same shade of colour. Paintings in this style are well drawn and look more realistic than those of boldly filled in silhouettes;
3.	White semi-realistic silhouettes. This is a very prolific style representing both human figures and animals, predominantly naturalistic but some elements of stylization are present. Paintings are executed in various shades of white and filled in with either a thin wash or a thick paste of the same colour. The painting art in this style is generally poor;
4.	Abstract and geometric figures being representations of different geometric motifs of lines, circles, square dots and non-geometric signs and symbols. They are more commonly done in white but orange, brown, red and black are also found. The more common geometrics found are simple lines, crosses, checkers, ladders and circles. Abstract figures include dragon-like pictures, symbols and dots.
Detailed assessments of Kisese 1 sites by Mary D. Leakey concluded that the rock art of central Tanzania has 9 stylistic sequences (Leakey 1983). Leakey's stylistic scheme was arranged in a sequence from the earliest to the latest as indicated here:
1.	Black figures in thick outline, rather poorly drawn;
2.	Brown-faded brownish-red fingertip paintings such as the two groups of stylized human figures and unidentified spotted animals at Kisese 1;
3.	Naturalistic paintings in fine outline executed in free-flowing lines with great appreciation of form;
4.	Animals in red outline filled with yellow wash, most often used when depicting friezes;
5.	Naturalistic animals in full red;
6.	Naturalistic streaky style;
7.	Stiff wooden animals in rather thick, brick-red-outline, often without tails;
8.	Crude daubs in white, black and red; and
9.	Representations of humped cattle including symbols in both black as well as white pigments.
Anati (1983) identified six chrono-socio-economic styles. His scheme was a by-product of
102 documented rock art sites of Kondoa District and it emphasized the typological and chronological descriptions. Anati's scheme reflected the main socio-economic activities of the society based on the depicted figures. Anati proposed six styles for the rock art of Tanzania, starting from the later to the earliest ones:
1.	Late White Bantu (Farming and Mixed Economy) in which figures are dominated by white colours. Depicted animals are commonly domesticated cattle, goats and sheep. In rare cases, there are snakes, lizards and crocodiles. The style belongs to the Iron Age period dating from early centuries of the first millennium AD, though some of the paintings might be as recent as 300 to 200 years ago;
2.	Pastoral culture dominated by oxen-zebu or humped animals. They are painted in black, grey and green-grey colour. They are believed to date between 3000 BC and early centuries of the first millennium AD;
3.	Stone Bowl Culture: the culture is dominated by earth and mud colours characterized by large animal figures in which elephant is mostly depicted. Other animals include a few giraffes and wild carprines;
4.	Art of the Late Hunters: the dominant colours are the various shades of red. Other colours include yellow, orange, brown and violet. Painted figures are mostly in monochrome though there is a sporadic representation of biochrome and polychrome figures. Depicted figures include humans carrying bows and arrows, in hunting scenes. Particular attention was given to body decoration, hairstyles, clothing and headdresses. The eland is the most dominant animal depicted. Other depicted animals include the giraffe and antelope. It dates after 7000 BP and continued through the last millennium BC;
5.	Art of Early Collectors: the main colours are various shades of red and brown. The subject matters include anthropomorphic figures engaged in dances, social activities and religious activities dated between 12,000 and 7,000 BP;
6.	Early Hunter Style: this is dominated by a dark reddish brown colour. The subject matters are animals and symbols while human figures are rarely depicted and sometimes absent. It probably began as early as 40,000-50,000 BP, but flourished during the period of 30,000-12,000 BP.
A study of rock art of north-central Tanzania by Mabulla and Gidna (2014) recognized four broad traditional styles on the basis of predominating colour types, subject matters and artistic styles. These are:
1.	The Hunter-Forager Art Tradition: The clarity of painting's edges suggests that the “Hunter-Forager” art were painted with fine “brushes”. On the basis of subject matter and superimposition, they subdivide this art tradition into two broad categories: the “HunterForager Figurative Fine Line” (H-F, FFL) and the “Hunter-Forager Red Geometric” (H-F, RG). Where H-F, FFL and H-F, RG art occur together, usually RG paintings overlie FFL paintings suggesting that FFL paintings are relatively older than RG paintings.
1.1.	The Hunter-Forager Figurative Fine-Line (H-F, FF-L) Art
This H-F, FF-L art depicts mostly wild animals in naturalistic and semi-naturalistic forms and humans in stylized form. Other subject matters include depictions of birds, vegetation, handprints, and anthropomorphic, therianthropic and shamanistic figures. Also present are spectacular panoramas of dynamic daily lives of these hunterforagers. Mostly the paintings are in various shades of red, dark red, reddish brown, and reddish-orange. Very few were painted in yellow colour and in two or more colours. Paintings were executed in fine-lines possibly using brushes and showing details of the painted figures.
1.2.	The Hunter-Forager Red Geometric Tradition (H-F, RG) Art
It is executed in fine-lines using “brushes”. It is dominated by depictions of geometric designs. Typical designs include circles, concentric circles, circles with externally radiating lines, circles surrounded by ordered lines of dots, semi-circles, dots, divided circles, ladders, lines, and sets of horizontal and vertical lines. Other accompanying figures include few wild animals and “stick”-like human figures. These were painted in various shades of red colour.
2.	The Pastoral Art Tradition: is executed in fine-lines using brushes. This is a rare rock art tradition in north-central Tanzania. At present, it has only been recorded at two sites. Paintings of domesticated animals constitute the principal subject matters. Identifiable animals include humped bovids (cattles) and ovicaprids (sheep and goats). The cattle are painted in red while the sheeps and goats are painted in white or dirty-white colours
3.	Bantu-speaking or Late White Art Tradition: is attributed to Bantuspeaking Iron-Working farmers and was mostly painted using fingers. The paintings appear crude and the tradition is dominated by geometric designs including dots, lines, circles, squares and smears. Also present are schematic depictions of anthropomorphic figures such as “spread-eagle”, “spread-legged” or distended human figures, “stick”-like human figures and stylized animal figures. These are predominantly painted in “white” or “dirty-white” colours. Other colours include red, orange, yellow and black, but these are secondary. Where more than one colour is employed, usually “dirty-white” colour is superimposed on top of the other colour.
5.	Maasai Olpul Art Tradition: The paintings are mostly executed in red, orange, white and black colours. The subject matters include, humans, domesticated and wild animals, and tools and weapons such as spears and shields. Also painted are geometric designs such as concentric circles and squares. Cattle are the only domesticated animals painted. At many of the sites, large humped bulls dominate.
It is clear that there are numerous socio-economic schemes in studying the rock art of Tanzania. Most of the researchers develop the scheme that is seen applicable to the rock art found in the area. Clearly, most of present studies adopt previous schemes and modify them by incorporating with other studies. Therefore, there is no common analytical socio-economic scheme in studying and classifying the rock art of Tanzania. Most of the schemes use colour and subject matter as the basis for rock paintings classification. The recent study of rock art of Uganda (see Namono 2010) suggests that rock art tradition classification might be influenced by variation in image typology and that colour may not be a fundamental factor in distinguishing different traditions. She continues to argue that we should distinguish images on the basis of shape. Yet, she agreed that in some cases colour might be used to help in classification of rock traditions, for example, in Malawi and Zambia (see Smith 1995).
3.5	The Rock Art of Lake Victoria Basin, Tanzania
Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) is the second area with high concentration of rock art especially on the western and southern shore of the lake (Mabulla 2005). This area includes Mwanza, Kagera and Mara Regions (Chaplin 1974; Masao 1991a; Odner 1971; Soper and Golden 1969; Tanner 1953; Mabulla 2005; Figure 7). As noted by Mabulla (2005), Kagera region, which is located on the western shore of the lake, is the richest in paintings than Mwanza. The painting sites in Kagera regions are concentrated in Bukoba Rural, Urban districts and Muleba districts (Ibid). More than 35 sites constituting over 90 painted shelters, overhangs, and caves have been reported (Chaplin 1974; Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mturi and Bushozi 2002). In Mwanza region about 21 rock art sites have been recorded in and around Mwanza Gulf (Chaplin 1974; Soper and Golden 1969; Tanner 1953). In 2002 the Mara Archaeological Reconnaissance Project documented nine rock art sites composed of 14 painted shelters and overhangs (see Mabulla 2005). Most of the paintings sites occur in Musoma Rural, Musoma town and Bunda district. The discovery of these rock art sites in Mara region has broadened our knowledge of rock art in LVB. As shown by Mabulla (2005), most of archaeological evidences in Lake Victoria Basin are those derived from researches conducted in Kagera and
Mwanza from the early 1950s to late 1970s. He continued to argue that, compared with Kenya and Uganda sections, the archaeological knowledge of LVB in Tanzania is still patchy. Therefore the Mara Archaeological Reconnaissance Project was developed to address that problem (Mabulla 2005). It is obvious that the sites discovered, recorded and documented from Kagera, Mwanza and Mara regions have given us great insights into the rock art of LVB (Chaplin 1974; Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mabulla 2005; Mturi and Bushozi 2002; Soper and Golden 1969; Tanner 1953) but still other regions like Simiyu are still archaeologically terra incognita. This study addressed this problem by surveying, studying and recording the rock paintings and the archaeology of Simiyu region.

Figure 7: Distribution of major rock art sites around Lake Victoria Basin, Tanzania Source: Modified after Chaplin 1974
There are similarities and differences in terms of subject matter, style and colour of rock paintings of LVB. Geometric figures and stylized cattle form the subject matter of Kagera rock art (Chaplin 1974; Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mturi and Bushozi 2002). The stylised
cattle dominate in Bukoba Rural and Urban district whereas those of geometric figures dominate in Muleba (Kwekason and Chami 2003; Mturi and Bushozi 2002). Also figures representing lacustrine adaptations (e.g., fishing activities, canoes and/or boats) occur but are rare (Chaplin 1974; Mturi and Bushozi 2002). These paintings are painted in red. Geometric figures seen in Kagera region were also observed in Mwanza and they dominate the region (Chaplin 1974; Soper and Golden 1969; Tanner 1953). The cattle forms, human figures and figures representing lacustrine adaptations like those from Kagera region are also present but rare (Tanner 1953; Soper and Golden 1969; Chaplin 1974). In Mwanza region, the paintings are executed in red colour similar to the paintings of Kagera Region, but some are in purple and brown colours. Mabulla (2005) observed that the Mara Region rock paintings share some characteristics with the rock paintings found elsewhere in LVB. A possible canoe figures found at Nyabekwabi, fish-like creatures found at Balima and a human fishing at Chamsinja, represent lacustrine resources or fishing activities (Mabulla 2005). Furthermore the majority of paintings are painted in various shades of red and very few in black or yellow. Three inclusive differences were noted between the rock paintings of Mara Region and those of Kagera and Mwanza Regions. Firstly, ‘‘ the stylized cattle forms that dominate among the painted figures in Bukoba Rural (Chaplin 1974; Mturi and Bushozi 2002) and Muleba districts (Kwekason and Chami 2003), and at many sites in Uganda and Kenya (Chaplin 1974) are absent in Mara region”. Other major differences not only in rock painting sites of Kagera and Mwanza regions but also in Africa at large were reported in Mabulla (2005) as follows:
The “uterus-like” design is characteristic of the Mara Region alone as it has not been reported anywhere else in Africa. Also the stylized large human, animal and weapon figures at Chamsinja have never been found before in East Africa.
In 2010, the author of this study assisted Musa Said in conducting archaeological survey to search for more possible rock shelters with rock paintings and excavating rock shelters, which had a lot of stratified archaeological materials in Kasoma village, Musoma rural. One rock shelter (see Mabulla 2005; Said 2012; pers. observation) was observed with this surprisingly “uterus-like” design that Mabulla reported. Mabulla (2005) argues that the Mara region's rock art is fascinating and informative. This is in line with my observations made during fieldwork in Kasoma village, Musoma rural with Musa Said in 2010.
Rock art researches around LVB have divided the rock paintings into different rock art traditions depending on the regions. In Bukoba the majority of art are semi-representational figures (Chaplin 1974). They are either intended to depict humans or cattle (Ibid). The stylized cattle and horns have been recorded. The paintings are executed in red and yellow. According to Arundell (1936:114 in Chaplin 1974), he regarded the design as conventional figures and argued that Bantu people drew the paintings. Mabulla (2005) argues that the stylized cattle designs probably belong to the herders and farmers. From his observations the Kagera paintings are “agro-pastoralist art”. Originally the Bantu people are farmers and herders.
Researches by scholars in Mwanza Gulf have revealed that geometric design dominates the art of the region (Chaplin 1974; Soper and Golden 1969; Tanner 1953). Geometric designs are in form of concentric circles, spirals, ellipses, wavy, curved and straight lines, dots, incisions. The paintings are in reds, purples, and brown (Chaplin 1974). But other representational figures in the same context have been observed including turtle like figures, cattles, and wild animal figures, such as “rhinoceros”.
In Mara region two rock art traditions have been identified (Mabulla 2005). These are characterized by the red geometric designs and red animal designs. As observed by Mabulla (2005), the red geometric design is predominant art in many sites in Mara region. As shown in Mabulla (2005), the typical designs in this art include that fascinating “uterus-like” designs, “oval” designs, circles, concentric circles, circles with externally radiating lines, circles surrounded by ordered lines of dots, semi-circles, dots, divided circles, ladders, lines, sets of parallel lines and “H-like” designs. Other accompanying figures include a few wild animals, some weapons (bow and arrows), crude human (“stick”, “alligator-like” and “rectangular”) designs, distended human figures and snake-like designs. All the paintings are in red. Mabulla (2005) observed that the geometric art of Mara region is similar to that of Mwanza Gulf.
Another rock art tradition, which was observed by Mabulla in Mara region, is that of the red animal tradition. This tradition occurs only at Chanyamsinja rock shelter. The paintings are characterized by thick-line painting of fairly large paintings in red and yellowish red of animals, humans, spears, an arrow and vertical parallel lines (Mabulla 2005). The human figures in this tradition depict carrying objects on top of their head. In his assessment
Mabulla (2005) commented that, this rock art tradition differs from the Hunter-Forager Figurative Fine-Line art tradition of Kondoa, Singida and Eyasi Basin. Nonetheless the red animal tradition resembles that of Zambia in terms of painting style, colour and depictions of fairly large stylized animals, dots and parallel lines (Mabulla 2005).
Generally the rock art of LVB regions share some close similarities. However differences also have been noted. In terms of subject matter, almost the majority of the sites within the region share some close relationships. Stylized animals and human figures have been observed. Geometric tradition is occurring all around LVB. The paintings are executed in red, but also in brown and yellow colours. The stylized cattle are common in Kagera region. Possible canoe figures, fish-like creatures and a human fishing suggesting lacustrine resources or fishing activities are only found in sites in Kagera and Mara regions (Chaplin 1974; Mabulla 2005). Also, at present, the “uterus-like” design is characteristic of the Mara Region alone as it has not been reported anywhere else in Africa (Mabulla 2005).
3.6	Age of Lake Victoria Basin Rock Art
Providing chronological context of rock art of Tanzania remains a major challenge in rock art research and the rock art of LVB is not different. Secure age dates are unavailable in rock art of Tanzania since no direct dating of the pigments has been conducted. Chronology of paintings in this area as many parts of the country has been resolved with relative dating associating archaeological findings. Therefore most of rock sites in this area are associated with Later Stone Age (LSA) and Iron Age (IA) archaeological remains dating to about 15,000 BP to 200 BP (Chaplin 1974; Kwekason and Chami 2003; Said 2012).
The recent excavation of rock art shelters was done in 2010 (Said 2012). The excavation was conducted in Kasoma village, Musoma rural district, and Mara region. The author of this study was part of the team conducted the excavations of the shelters with rock art and surveying for more possible rock shelters with rock art. In his study, Musa Said aimed at studying the culture and societies of the rock painters of Kasoma village, Musoma rural. His study was guided by two objectives, which he successfully accomplished. These were (i) to study human behaviours including cultural capabilities and subsistence patterns reflected by lithic artifacts, fossil fauna, and other symbolic revealing artifacts such as beads, ochre and pottery and (ii) to establish the culture history of the area through studying stone tools and pottery typologies and compositions. The study indicated that the Ceramic LSA people
represent the early occupation of shelters in Kasoma village (Said 2012). Ceramic LSA people succeeded these. The data analysis indicated that the Aceramic LSA of Nyamang'ora and Nyankingi rock shelters resemble to the Silale industry established first by Mehlman (1989) and dated to 8,100 bp at Nasera rock shelter. Also the Ceramic LSA is associated with Kansyore pottery and resembles the Olmoti industry at Nasera rock shelter and is dated to 5,400 bp (Mehlman 1989). Therefore, Said (2012) concluded that from 8,000 to 5,000 bp hunter-gatherer communities that relied on lithic tools, pottery, and painted on rock shelters occupied this area.
Another archaeological research was that done in Muleba district, Kagera region. The study was conducted in 2002 (Kwekason and Chami 2003). Their excavation retrieved cultural materials from Middle Stone Age as well as Later Stone Age. In addition, they recovered potsherds. The analysis of potteries revealed that they belong to Turkwell tradition. Currently, the tradition is recognized as a facie of Kansyore ware, Early Iron Age (EIA)-Urewe ware and Roulette pottery tradition (Said 2012). In their study Chami and Kwekason (2002) could not observe any cultural continuity and hence they recommended for more comprehensive research and material analysis to address this problem.
It is important to study the archaeology so as to understand the culture and behaviours of the rock artists of Simiyu region. Also it is important to understand the cultural chronology and the history of the area through archaeological studies. This study did not conduct archaeological excavation of the rock shelters nor collect pigment for dating. Future study needs to address this so as to establish the culture and absolute dating of the region. As stated earlier, before this study no any rock art research had been conducted in this region. Chaplin (1974) observed that the LVB is geographically important for rock art studies because it occupies part of the ‘no man's land' between the two major rock art areas of the Sahara to the north and southern/central Africa to the south and hence called for more and more research in the area. Apart from the gaps this study has observed and stated, it also responds to this call.
3.7	Rock Art as Archaeological Record
Through rock art we can understand and tell the present generation about past technology, culture, people, symbolism, religious and human's daily lives. In some of the rock art, humans are painted carrying bows and arrows and, in some cases, it is clearly seen that arrowheads were made of hafted geometric microliths (Mturi 1998). Such depictions tell
about the technology used to manufacture tools but also the bow and arrows hunting techniques and daily life (Mturi 1998). In Lake Victoria Basin, for example, (Sasson 1983 in Mabulla 2005) recovered iron artifacts from Bweranyange in Karagwe that were historically interpreted to represent cattle. According to Mabulla (2005), those iron cattle possibly belong to the Late Iron Age period and may have been made by the rock art painters in Kagera. Within LVB, there are also figures representing lacustrine adaptations like fishing activities, fish, canoes and boats that symbolize fishing technology and activities (Mturi 2001; Mabulla 2005).
Also ceramic objects have been depicted in rock art. The study by Dos Santos (2013) observed anthropomorphic figures that appear carrying or sharing objects for instance polished axes. He argued that the ceramists or basketry cultures possibly could have produced these objects. Dos Santos (2013) strongly commented pottery depictions could really exist in the rock art.
Through rock art we can reconstruct the past environment and resources that were available in society. According to Mturi (1998), the variety of depicted animals and plants is a good testimony of the type of environments and resources available, which could have been exploited by hunting and gathering communities of a given area. Also the mode of subsistence and various economic activities depicted in the art help us to reconstruct the past environment and available resources by then in the landscape. Some paintings depict hunting and collecting scenes, people fishing from boats and scenes of honey gathering (Masao 1976; Mturi 1998, 2001; Mabulla 2005; Abreu 2013; Itambu 2013). Human figures in this case are painted holding hunting weapons such as bows and arrows, and spear. In some occasion human figures are depicted shooting at animals (Mabulla and Gidna 2014) or hunting on top of horse while holding a spear (Abreu 2013). However, other scholars argue differently by asserting that depictions of rows of men holding arrows represent a ritual occasion rather than an economic activity as is the cases in the Western Cape Province (Parkington, et.al., 1996). Domesticated animals and people processing plant foods (Mabulla and Gidna 2014) are also depicted in rock art. Such depictions can be taken to mean evidence of food producing economies.
Also, rock art depicts ritual and belief systems of concerned societies. Some paintings were connected with ritual and religious activities (Bednarik 1990; Bahn 1997; Mturi 1998). The
paintings can be used as symbols and icons such that archaeologists can decode the meaning of the symbols and icons. In South Africa, rock art is associated with the trance experience of shamans and these paintings were powerful ritual objects, not just pictures (Bower 1996). Lewis-William (1995) argued that a group of eight ‘San' pictures dating to several hundred years ago depicts shamans' trance-induced journeys to the spirit world. He argued that ‘San' shamans used dancing and hyperventilation rather than hallucinogenic substance to enter trance states. This clearly shows rock art scientists can reconstruct religious, rituals and belief systems of communities who executed the paintings.
3.8	Theories and Interpretation of Rock Art
Theories have been proposed by researchers to interpret rock art. Artistic production and characteristics of the art made scientific community to develop theories in explaining the meaning. These theories proposed include sympathetic magic and fertility rites, art for art's sake and shamanism. The theories have been explained and documented in many literatures and publications (see Uncko and Rosenfeld 1967; Anati 1968; Brentjes 1969; Rudner and Rudner 1972; Vinnicombe 1972; Hill 1974 in Masao 1979) hence won't be discussed here.
In North America two schools of thought to view rock art have been recognized. These are:
(1)	most rock art were produced for ideological or aesthetic purposes, ceremonies, mythological narrative, representation of visions, artistic expression, etc., and (2) most petroglyphs were produced for pragmatic purposes, to convey information markers, maps, counters, labels, etc. (see Swartz 2000). The first school of thought corresponds to the sympathetic magic and art for art's sake developed by other scholars. Ross (2001) identified 10 leading theories about the function and meaning of rock art. These include,
1.	Trance shamanism and entoptic/phosphine phenomena (Clottes and LewisWilliams 1998; Hedges 1983; Hyder and Lee 1994; Whitley 1998 in Ross 2001)
2.	Shrine (Grant 1967; Schaafsma 1992 in Ross 2001)
3.	Archaeoastronomy (Hudson and Lee 1984 in Ross 2001)
4.	Trade markings (Hartley and Vawser 1998 in Ross 2001)
5.	Hunter (Tacon and Brockwell 1995 in Ross 2001)
6.	Puberty and other communal rites (Grant 1967; Hudson and Lee 1984; Solomon 1998; Whitley 1998 in Ross 2001)
7.	Riverine, territory and trail/path markers (Bradley 1997; Hyder 1989; Tacon et al., 1997; Tilley 1996 in Ross 2001)
8.	Biographical and narrative (Klassen 1998 in Ross 2001)
9.	Vision quest/non-shamanic trance (Whitley 1992 in Ross 2001)
10.	Event/mythical/historical markers (Hudson and Lee 1984; Ouzman 1998; Schaafsma 1992; Stoffle at al., 1997 in Ross 2001).
It is important to understand these theories when studying rock art. They may not only act as guides when doing the interpretation but also to come up with procedures, techniques in answering rock art questions. Schaafsma (1985) noted that theory governs the questions we address, methods and techniques that are useful in finding the answers. Ross (2001) argued that in order to understand theories and the context of interpretation of the hunter-foragers rock art, it is vital to know what is the fundamental and essential to all hunter-foragers cultures. According to him, the most fundamental element is that hunter-foragers had a sophisticated, specific and intimate relationship with the natural land upon which they live. This relationship with the natural land, observation and perception of the environment are portrayed in the rock art. In addition to that hunter-foragers are mobile societies and that they use sophisticated cultural navigational strategies to journey across the land and along water routes. Therefore to him rock art meaning might be reflected relating to these journeys. Moreover Ross noted that location of mythic, historical events, cosmological structures, wisdom teachings and ritual symbolisms within the specific landscape or site might be reveal the meaning of the hunter-foragers rock art. To him there is connection of physical location of the rock art sites in the landscape, geomorphological attributes (rock outcrop, cliff face, rock shelter walls and ceiling) and the rock panel themselves which in fact were important symbolically.
Generally rock art interpretation is difficult and it faces a lot of challenges. Historically the interpretation of rock art focused on the motifs, styles and studying the symbols (Ross 2001). Still most of the current studies use the motifs, and styles in understanding the meaning. But also it is still common to find interpretation of rock art based on previous researchers’ documentation. Although many have proved to be accurate and relevant to consult, there is a need to acquire new approaches to understand better the context of rock art. Ross (2001) comments that although it is important to interpret rock art in the context of ‘rockscape’, but the current and new approaches of interpretation should focus on the ‘holistic’ context which includes a more accurate view of hunter-gatherer’s culture, landscape, information from contemporary native peoples, style and motifs, historical, ethnographic, and cultural
materials.
Chippindale and Tacon (1998) provided the unities and approaches in studying rock art. These unities include definition of rock art, dating rock art and three approaches to interpretation, which are ‘formal’, ‘informed’ and ‘analogy’. According to them ‘formal’ are those approaches that depend on no inside knowledge. The information in this approach is restricted to that which immanent in the image themselves or which we can discern from their relations to each other and to the landscape, or in relation to the other archaeological context. ‘Informed’ is defined as those approaches that depend on some source of insights passed directly or indirectly from those who made and used the rock art through ethnography, ethnohistory and historical records. “Analogy’ is the approach by which we interpret one thing by finding something else that it is like.
As seen earlier, natural lands upon which rock art artists lived are the most fundamental element in interpretation of rock art. In hunter-gatherer cultures, information about environments is transmitted from one generation to another over thousands of years, resulting in detailed compendium of vital environmental knowledge and successful economy (see Lewis-William et al., 1993; Smith 1994; Wright 1994; Conkey 1996; Bradley 1997; DiazGranados and Duncan 2000 in Ross 2001). This shows how the understanding of location and landscape setting are crucial in understanding how, where and why the rock art was made and used in deriving the meaning. These are discussed in the following sections.
3.9	Location
Production, consumption and representation of rock art is attributed to a number of variables. Rock art studies have pointed out that the variables relating to the characteristics of the shelter, its location in the landscape to include its accessibility, prominence, visibility and orientation are crucial in our understanding the context of use of the site. It is only by studying these variables we can possibly understand that the fulfillment of different economic activities might have social or symbolic dimensions leading to the production of art (Fairen-Jimenez 2007).
The study by Namono (2010) recorded physical characteristics of the sites so as to know the past use of the site and habitation of the place. Namono classified site type based on whether the painted panel occurs on an overhang, on the exposed surface of a boulder or on the
ceiling or lip of a rock. Her aim was to determine whether sites had deep shelters suitable for habitation as suggested by Lawrance (1953) and Posnansky (1961). She found out that some rock art sites might be big enough for only one or two people (e.g. Ngora 1) while others may hold quite a large crowd (e.g. Lolui main, Nyero 2 or Obwin 1; see Namono 2010). A study by Masao (1979) also identified three types of rock painting sites in central Tanzania. These were straight-faced rock shelters, shelters with overhangs and exterior caves. In his study, rock shelters with overhangs were the commonest type of sites in central Tanzania accounting to a total of 70 sites. Masao (1979) reported the preference of overhangs shelters over straight-faced ones and caves as follows:
“Not only did the overhangs offer protection from the direct assault of heavy rainfall and the resultant cascading water and in other times shade from the hot sun, but afforded an ideal place to camp and watch the game. Some of the game thus watched, it may be assumed, formed the subject matter, which was depicted on the rock face in various styles and techniques”.
The investigation of locational settings may also answer the question as to why certain surfaces were chosen for painting or engraving and not others. Observations by Namono (2010) indicate that some sites were specifically chosen while very similar locations were ignored. Similar observation at Nyero was reported by Lawrance (1953). Lawrance found out many shelters around Nyero but only two rock shelters had paintings. Also Chaplin observed that in the Teso area- there are excellent surfaces on sheltered and conspicuous rocks that seem very suitable, but no traces of ochre can be found on them (Chaplin 1974: 34). On Lolui islands Chaplin noted that there are other ideal surfaces entirely devoid of decoration in such positions as to preclude destruction by weathering of once- existing ochre. Clearly, as discussed here, paintings could never have been executed if the necessary technology of painting rocks was not available (Holl 2002). There was a need for painters to learn how to create and make beautiful paintings. The artists, depending on their level of expertise, may have mastered a certain range of pictorial techniques, knowledge and skills of painting and identification of suitable and reliable rock surfaces to work on.
Consideration of sites orientation as well as their exposure to sun provides a broad range of rock art interpretation about site choices (see Clark 1959; Masao 1979; Smith 1995; Mabulla 2005; Namono 2010; Rasolondrainy 2011). Namono (2010) considered site orientations to determine which surfaces are frequently painted on, the visibility of the panels and whether the orientation of the panel influenced choice of site for painting on. The results of her
analysis indicated that 53.1% of the painted sites oriented southerly. She argued that deliberate selection of southerly oriented sites may be linked to rain control and fertility. In addition to that rainfall on the greater part of Uganda is a product of evaporation, spread by southeast winds enforced by Lake Victoria breezes. Southerly orientation of the sites particularly for the Geometric Art tradition has also been reported in Zambia and Mara region, Tanzania (see Smith 1995; Mabulla 2005). In Kondoa and Singida, Tanzania, sites face either east or west however preference was great for the east facing sites only in Kondoa (Masao 1979). This was accounted for warming effects from the sun in the mornings and assurance of shade and cool atmosphere in the evenings. Such condition would make less tedious work in the rock shelter, whether the work was painting or tool manufacturing (Masao 1979). Therefore, deliberate choices of east-west facing shelters were done even when there were equally suitable shelters but of different orientation (Masao 1979).
Availability of resources is another meaningful aspect when exploring selection of rocks for painting. Choices of rock sites by prehistoric painters may have been influenced by the availability of food resources and water. Marufu (2012) observed that many of the rock art sites with paintings were located close to either water or plant food sources. This is also demonstrated by Hadza hunter-foragers who place their camps near food and water resources (Blurton Jones 2011). Also these two ecological factors influence Hadza hunter-forager mobility patterns in the Eyasi Basin (Mabulla 1996; 2003). Another important aspect in selecting rock art sites was vantage point. According to Namono (2010) there is a relationship between site location and use of site. Rock shelters with good command of the surrounding areas were preferred. Nonetheless, painting was not restricted to these rock surfaces. For example, in central and north-central Tanzania rock art sites are located high up on the bush covered hillsides, overlooking some plains, a valley or a river (Masao 1979; 2008; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Hill slope sites commanded wide views over far reaching plains and immediate areas around for watching game or hostile warring bands (see Masao 1979). Moreover, hill slopes were also suitable for camping during wet seasons, when low-lying plains would be liable to flooding. Yet, some rock art sites in north-central Tanzania also occur in the foot slopes of hills bordering the plains (Mabulla and Gidna 2014).
3.10	Landscape
Until recent years rock art has been kept aside within landscape context. Not even cultural anthropology and archaeology have historically had much to say about the place, leaving a
gap in our understanding of rock art within the context of landscape (Bradley 1997). Rock art is found where it was made. But also rock art establishes a place from space (Nash 2000). This act of choosing a space and turning it into a place, positioning figures and the rock surface and using a place over generations require and reinforce an affinity with landscape (Nash 2000). This thinking has recently stimulated a number of landscape analysis studies in the field of rock art (Bender 2006; Bradley 1997, 2000; Nash 2000; Helskog 2001; LewisWilliams 2002a; Nash and Chippindale 2002; Chippindale and Nash 2004).
To acquire understandings of the context in which rock art was made, used and distributed within the landscape it is also necessary to consider the daily routines of prehistoric communities. It has been noted that hunter-gatherers were responsible in defining their foraging territories in the landscape that they exploited (Nash 2000). They identified significant landscape features, which served as signposts in the landscape (Nash 2000). Bradley (2002) shows that rock art was also used to mark paths, rivers, and resources to claim ownership or ancestral affiliations over specific areas; and even to impose limits to the movement through landscape or access to specific area.
The importance of landscape context in the interpretation of hunter-gatherer rock art is also reflected in the location of mythic and historic events, cosmological structures, wisdom teaching and ritual symbolism within specific landscapes (Ross 2001). Rock art sites represented human knowledge about the past, and when associated with specific myths the art served to facilitate sacred communications in ritual contexts (see Hudson and Lee's 1984; Ouzman 1998). According to Whitley (1998), in studying the physical location of rock art sites in the landscape, the geomorphological attributes are symbolically important as the iconography. Therefore the landscape gains the meaning when interpreting rock art, because the characteristics of rock art depend on its placement on the natural landscape (Whitley 1998). This is in line with the observations of Nash (2000) who argued that the diversity of European landscape and their topographic features might have influenced different rock art styles and the subject matters. Consequently, the site's landscape context is crucial in understanding the meanings and functions of rock art.
It is evident that no comprehensive interpretation of rock art can be conducted that ignores its location within, and relationships to, the landscape. Ross (2001) suggests that the landscape
should be considered as an essential context for rock art studies. Through this, the meanings and functions of rock art may be reconstructed.
CHAPTER FOUR
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
4.0 Introduction
This chapter describes the research methods that were employed in collecting the data. Both primary and secondary data were collected. Primary data were collected through inquiries about known rock-painting sites, archaeological surveys, recording/documentation and study of the paintings. These methods are described in details in the next sections. Secondary data were in form of documentary reviews.
4.1	Primary Data
4.1.1	Use of informants
An inquiry about known rock-painting sites was my main technique of finding rock art sites. Co-operation with wildlife game rangers and local people was necessary in implementing the project. While traversing the landscape, wildlife game rangers and local people constantly inventory its resources for conservation and future use, including painted rock shelters. With limited funds, labour, and time this method facilitated and quickened the finding and documentation of rock art sites.
4.1.2	Survey strategies
Inquiries about known rock-painting sites were supplemented by random surface survey of potential areas. Random surface was chosen instead of systematic survey because of time and financial constraints, dense vegetation cover and rocky terrain. A team of three to four crewmembers surveyed, located recorded and documented sites in details. The survey took place in rock outcrops nearby identified rock shelters with paintings. In game controlled areas, an armed ranger accompanied the survey team.
4.1.3	Studying the paintings
In studying the rock paintings of Simiyu region, I employ the traditional approach that of describing and typing the paintings on the basis of style and technique of production. Moreover, the rock art sites and the surrounding landscape and ecology were described in detail. This approach will enable us to build up a large and important body of information related to rock art. This database will enable present and future researchers to understand the patterns of relationships between painting(s) and site(s) and site(s) and landscape(s) (Lim
1992; Smith 1995). Only by understanding these relationships, can “meaning(s)” and “motive(s)” be derived.
The paintings were described and classified according to their subject matters, stylistic characteristics, composition, action, aspect, and techniques of execution. In this aspect, The study adopted Mabulla and Gidna's (2014) chrono-socio-economic framework. In their study of the rock paintings of north-central Tanzania, Mabulla and Gidna (2014) recognized four major traditions. These traditions beginning from the youngest are: 1) Maasai Olpul art, 2) Bantu-language-speaker art, 3) Pastoral art and 4) Hunter-Forager art. The later is subdivided into a) Hunter-Forager Figurative Fine Line (H-F, FFL) and b) Hunter-Forager Red Geometric (H-F, RG).
4.1.4	Evaluating the state of paintings and sites
Although the rock art of some parts of Tanzania (central, north-central and LVB) have received much attention and possibly detailed studies and documentations (Foosbrooke 1950; Leakey 1983; Lim 1992; Mabulla 2005; Masao 2007; Mahudi 2008; Bwasiri 2008), the conservation and management of the paintings and sites have never been a major focus of these research projects. Nevertheless, Leakey (1983), Mabulla (2005) and Mabulla and Gidna (2014) noted the deteriorating conditions of the paintings and sites. Following Mabulla and Gidna's (2014) approach, the study evaluated and analyzed in detail the state of preservation of paintings and sites, sources of potential threats to their integrity and survival; the shelter's/overhang's exposure to sunlight, slope, modern usage of rock art sites, and suitability for public display and archaeo-tourism. This approach is, by itself, a conservation and management strategy, the first step towards saving this priceless national and international cultural heritage from vanishing (Mabulla and Gidna 2014).
4.1.5	Ethnographic inquiries
An ethnographic inquiry was employed in order to understanding the past and present use of rock art sites. An ethnographic inquiry allows the researcher to study the lifestyles and belief systems of modern societies in reconstructing the past life ways (Itambu 2013). Scholars agree that indigenous people like the Bushmen, Sandawe, Maasai and Hadza offer the best opportunities for the better understanding the meaning(s) of rock paintings (Coulson and Campbell 2001; Mahudi 2008; Bendera, 2011; Itambu 2013). Accordingly, in the field the author informally interviewed one local Maasai wildlife game ranger residing in Mwiba
Ranch. The interview centered on the painters and meaning(s) of the rock paintings at the Gululu rock shelter.
4.2.	Secondary Data
Secondary data were collected through documentary review. Various published and unpublished literatures were consulted so as to familiarize with the study area, previous researches and themes about rock art studies in Tanzania in particular.
4.3.	Ethical Considerations
Research clearance letter from local supervisor and the proposal draft were submitted to the Department of Antiquities (DoA), Ministry of Tourism and Natural Resources in Tanzania. DoA issued me a research permission letter. On arrival to Meatu district, the author submitted the research permission letter to the District Commissioner (DC) who on behalf of the Regional Commissioner (RC) gave me a letter approving my study in the district. The Dc’s letter was submitted to wards, villages, Mwiba Ranch and Maswa GR officials where the study was undertaken.
4.4	Data Recording and Documentation System
Opinions differ on how to record and document rock paintings. Some authorities argue that tracing is more superior to any other technique of rock art recording and documentation (Fordyce 1983:3 cited in Smits 1991). On the contrary, others believe that photography is the best method of rock art recording and documentation (Smits 1988, cited in Smits 1991). However, as Smits (1991:251-252) correctly observe, “photography and tracing fulfill fundamentally different purposes of recording and documentation, they are not competing and are certainly not incompatible”. Yet, Inés et al., (2012) argue that digital recording allows the overlapping of many records or readings of the panel. Accordingly and due to time and financial constraints, photography was selected by this study to record and documents the rock paintings and associated data. A high-resolution digital camera, Canon EOS 600D, 18 megapixel was used in photographing relevant archaeological data, rock paintings and the environment contexts of the area.
The quantitative, qualitative, and distributional characteristics of rock paintings and sites (e.g., shelter’s/overhang’s size to include length, width and height, number of painted figures, size of the painted area, exposure to sunlight), artifacts, features, and other field observations
were recorded in field notebooks and on survey forms. The survey forms are standardized and formatted for computer analysis (Appendix 1-4). A Munsell color chart was used to record the main colours of the paintings. A hand-held Garmin GPS 72 was used to record and mark rock painting sites and other landmarks. A digital audio recorder was used in recording ethnographic conversations with informants. The height, length and width of shelters and painted panels were measured using a 50 meters tape measure. Due to time constraints and nature of shelter's location and position, topographic mapping of rock art sites was conducted only at Gululu and Nyungu rock shelters. Generally, daily field activities and field important observations were all carefully and in detail recorded in notebooks to avoid information loss.
4.5	Data Analysis and Presentation Plan
Initial rock painting analysis started in the field where recording, typology and inventory were undertaken. After fieldwork, gathered data were inserted in Microsoft Excel 2011 where frequencies and percentages were calculated. Then tables and charts were plotted to show relationships between variables (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Microsoft excel 2011 was useful in drawing tables and charts
Painting analysis employed the use of digital image processing and enhancement tools. ImageJ (Image Processing and Analysis in Java) and Adobe Photoshop C5 were used in tracing rock paintings so as to facilitate further understanding and interpretation of the depicted images (see Figure 9). Bonobo touchpad was used to facilitate precise tracings in
Adobe Photoshop C5 software. ImageJ plugin named DStretch was used to manipulate colours and bring up faded images or improve the clarity of colours (Plate 1).
Plate 1: Image manipulation by ImageJ, DStretch plugin
In Photoshop, ‘image adjustment tools’ like brightness/contrast, color balance, hue/saturation and black and white were used to improve the visualization of the image/panel. Color range tool was also used in selecting or deselecting the colour needed on the image. Then eraser tool and/or lasso tool was used to remove false colours. Magic wand, colour picker and paint bucket tools were used in coloring the images. All the described techniques were done after duplicating an invincible background layer that had an original image to be processed. Thereafter, a white or gray background layer was created because the traced images/panels had to retain white background. Then a series of layers were created depending on the amount of figures in the original panel. Each figure was traced separately to facilitate accuracy and neatness.

CHAPTER FIVE RESEARCH RESULTS
5.0 Introduction
This chapter presents the results from fieldwork. All the rock art recovered and observed data is described in this chapter. Also presented are the results of interview and data analysis.
5.1	Survey Results
Three weeks of archaeological fieldwork survey in Meatu district, Simiyu region yielded four-rock shelters/boulders with paintings. Although most of the rock art sites were the results of acquiring information from our key Hadza informant, and who was our research assistant, it was not easy to locate these sites as the informant saw those shelters very long time ago when he was hunting around those areas and sheltering himself and his family (parents). The author was eager to know for how long the key informant has not been in the areas and around the shelter and the reasons. He had these to say,
It is almost about 10 years since the last time I was here.. .By then I was still very young and living with my parents. We used to hunt and forage in this area even in the game reserve areas. These shelters were our homes. But the hunting restrictions around the game reserve forced us and many other Hadzabe (Hadza)1 to flee from the area.This is because many Hadzabe were sentenced in prisons for many years when they were caught hunting in the game reserve or even caught with wild meat. Thus we run to Mang’ola 2
Despite of difficulties in reaching the sites due to rough terrain landscape, thick vegetation with thorns and long hours of driving to and from the sites, the study was able to locate, document and study the shelters and boulder with paintings. The four located, documented and studied rock paintings sites are Butimba, Gululu, Nyungu and Kijashu. All the shelters and boulder were recorded and documented based on their local names as mentioned by local communities. This decision was reached in order avoid misunderstandings between the researcher and the local community when presenting data of this work to them and respective authorities. Also it might be useful and to avoid inconveniences when relocating the sites for

future studies. These rock art sites and their paintings are described in the following sections. Only Kijashu rock paintings are analyzed and studied in detail. The results of the site and painting analysis are presented in chapter six.
5.1.1	Kijashu rock boulder
This rock art site occurs in Maswa GR (Game Reserve). This is the largest boulder encountered in our fieldwork in terms of size of the painted area. Because all of the sites occur in the Game Protected Areas, their geographical locations are presented. This site is located at 03° 12' 21'' S and 034° 33' 222'' E with the elevation of 1,524 above sea level (a.s.l). The nature of site terrain is rocky and is dominated by bushy and thicket vegetation (Plate 2). The shelter was about 14.4 m long, 9 m wide and 12 m high. The size of painted area is about 23.2 m2 and the slope of painted rock is steep, about 40-90°. The site has evidence of past use and probably prehistoric people inhabited the area. The game ranger who accompanied the research crew said that ‘‘10 years ago the site was used as a poacher's hideout since game patrol was not yet consolidated''. This was evidenced by the presence of fireplaces with ashes in the site. Kijashu rock art contains “Hunter-Forager Art” Tradition. These are analyzed and presented in chapter six.

5.2.2	Nyungu rock shelter
Nyungu rock shelter occurs within the Makao Wildlife Managed Area (WMA). The shelter is located at 03° 33' 862” S and 034° 50' 302” E with an elevation of 1,735 a.s.l. The shelter is a circular granite boulder facing north. The site terrain is dominated by rocky and a mosaic type of vegetation including thorns, thickets and savannah grassland. The shelter had a length of 4.2 m, 5.0 m width and a height of 4.2 m. The size of the painted area is 20.2 m2. The slope of painted rock is steep about 40-90°. Just part of the site is exposed to sunlight due to the nature of the shelter. The site is named as Nyungu (Chungu in Kiswahili) due to its shape, like a pot. This site was mapped so as to give an overview of the size of the occupation area (Figure 10). Site mapping is very important in recording and understanding changes on the site uses over time and space (Itambu 2013).
Figure 10: Nyungu rock shelter site plan
Three painted panels were identified at Nyungu rock shelter. Overall, the subject matters include geometric figures, anthropomorphic figure and reptiles-like figures (Figure 11). Geometric figures dominate. The geometric designs are in the forms of bands of lines arranged in row, circles and semi-circles with internally vertical lines. The semi-circle (half circle on top, Panel 1) had three internally vertical lines. Although the complete circle was too faded particularly from the inside but the internal vertical lines were estimated to be three
at most. Bands of vertical lines consisted of three to ten vertical lines from 1 cm to 4 cm long. Furthermore, there were five separate bands of very small figures of less than 1 cm long. A stylized anthropomorphic figure is occurring in Panel 1. This is painted with one hand and represented by reverse articulation of legs (see Figure 11, Panel 1). Nonetheless the sexual and gender expression of the figure is not revealed. Also painted in Panel 1 are creatures with many small lines beneath the body that appear like legs. Probably these creatures are millipedes. A hand-like print is depicted on Panel Two. Nonetheless, this had only four fingers instead of five fingers. The painted figures weren't in scenic composition and they were in motionless. All the paintings were executed in monochrome weak red. Many of the painted images are faded and the edges are not clear. On the basis of subject matter, colour and style, the paintings of Nyungu rock shelter belong to the “Hunter-Forager, Red Geometric Art” tradition.
Figure 11: Nyungu rock shelter traced figures
The state of preservation of the site and the paintings is very poor. The visibility of the paintings was extremely poor. Thus identification of the painted figures in the field was difficult. Human, natural and biological factors were the main agents for the rock painting deterioration. Human agents include chalk graffiti (Plate 3) and smoke forming a film of soot on the shelter. Natural factors include weathering of paint and rock exfoliation. Biological factors were growing termite mounds, birds' excretions, birds' mud nests and wasp nests. Therefore, this site has low potential for public display and is not suitable for archaeo-tourism.

5.2.3	Butimba rock shelter
This was the first rock shelter to be located, documented and recorded. It occurs in Sungu area, Meatu district. The site is located at 03° 28' 069” S and 034° 36' 061” E and at 1,406 m a.s.l. The site occurs on granite rock outcrop (Plate 4). The primarily vegetation of the area included shrubs with small bushes and thickets. Also acacia woodlands occur. Baobab and candelabra trees (Euphobia candelabrum) were also seen in the area.
The shelter had the following measurements: 7.5 m long, 7 m wide, and 2.3 m high and 16.9 m2, size of painted area. The site is exposed to sunlight only during the morning. The paintings in this shelter are on ceiling making the slope of painted rock to be very low to less than 20°. As the paintings were in the ceiling it was very difficult to take photos. Thus the procedure was to lie down on the ground and take the photos. Also it was impossible to use the tripod stand in taking the photos. To the south of the site there was a river nearby. The river is seasonal due rainfall seasonality and weather uncertainty. The presence of the river might have influenced the prehistoric authors of the art to choose the site. But also this shelter is positioned on top of a boulder. This gives the shelter an excellent commanding view of the surrounding areas. Yet, being on top of a boulder, limited access to it from north, south and west because of the boulder's steepness. The only possible way to access the site is from the
east side. This might also be the reason as to why the painters chose the site, as it would be difficult to be easily accessed by other people.
Plate 4: Butimba rock outcrop landscape and surrounding ecology
The paintings on this site appears very crude, hand stencile. The subject matter is dominated by geometric figures. Also painted are domesticated animals and reptiles (Table 4). Geometric figures are in the forms of sun-like designs, star-like designs, crosses and lines. Also free-form abstraction are found in greatest abundance at Butimba. Also present, are paintings that can be intepreted as either cattle or humans. These type of paintings are similar to those found in Kagera region (see Chaplin 1974) with the exception that those in Kagera are painted in red colours while the ones at Butimba rock shelter are in dirty-white colour.
Other scholars such as Arundell (1936) and Fosbrooke (1950b) interpreted the so called cattle brands as schematized human figures. According to Chaplin (1974: 36) the cattle paintings are semi-representational figures that either intended to depict humans or cattle. Chaplin argued that for the figures to be considered as humans we must assume them to be headless as for cattle, the upper projections become horns but also body and neck become one, the legs trucked away become tail. With these descriptions he arrived in conclusion that the depiction
was intended to be cattles. Moreover Chaplin (1974: 36) considered these abstract cattle brands as late paintings around Lake Victoria.
In the category of reptiles, motifs depicted included snakes, alligators, lizards and dragon-like designs. Two snakes were observed at Butimba. Depictions of snakes and/or paired snakes have also been observed in Bukoba area (see Chaplin 1974). Snakes could be detected because of their elongated zig-zag looks, but also having heads at one end. One of the snake was very long to about 108.07 cm. This snake figure is the longest than all the painted figures occupying almost the height of the painted area on roof. Snakes figures were exucuted vertically on the roof of the shelter. Snakes particularly the longest one may be a specie of a python. Studies in some parts of Uganda and Bukoba area in Tanzania around Lake Victoria (see Chaplin 1974) show that some societies had strong connections with snakes, using them in initiation ritual ceremonies. Also these societies believe that snakes are inhabited by spirits of their ancestors. The Sukuma (Wasukuma) tribe from Mwanza, Shinyanga and Simiyu regions still presently dance with python in their traditional dances called “Bugobogobo”. Therefore, depictions of snake at Butimba may also suggest that initiation ceromonies were undertaken at the site.
The lizards were naturalistically depicted while the alligator-like figures were drawn in semi-naturalistic and schematic way with some parts, especially, the body and legs being exaggerated. The front legs of reptiles are schematized represented, facing front while the back legs are stylized, being smaller than the front legs. The dragon-like figures at Butimba are schematized drawn with two to three legs and being similar in size. Some of the figures are painted in motionless while others are in motionless,
The artistic representations at Butimba site appear in monochrome white pigments (Figure 12). Painted figures are filled in with thin wash and some with thick paste of the same colour, especially, the reptiles and many of the geometrics. The clarity of the colour was fairly moderate and the edges were moderately clear. Details of the pictographs were excellent to the extent that painted figures could be identified.
The state of preservation of the paintings is good and given the easy accessibility of the site, Butimba rock shelter is highly potential for public display as well as for archaeo-tourism. Therefore human agents damage to the paintings such as smokes due to habitation, scratching
the paintings and charcoal graffiti need to be controlled and monitored. Proper management of the site and education awareness to the community residing nearby and those still using the site need to be addressed and promoted. Studies on how to control the natural agents of damaging the art should also be devised.

The research team found a baboon skin at the site (Plate 5). Possibly, the baboon was killed and skinned at the site by Hadza hunter-foragers who live in the area and are known for consuming baboon meat. Baboon’s meat is highly favoured by the Hadza and is seen as delicious and medicinal meat (Mabulla 2007).
Plate 5: Baboon's skin inside the shelter
Another finding that was observed in the shelter is a circle of two tied sticks (Plate 6). Discussion with my Hadza informant concluded that the present community around the area uses the site for various activities. The findings evidenced the present use of the site for
habitation and ritual activities or ceremonial initiations. Also meat-processing and consumption activities by the Hadza hunter-foragers may have taken place at the site.

5.2.4	Gululu rock shelter
This was the only historic site located and documented in our field survey. This shelter was among of the painting site reported by the wildlife ranger. The other painting site is Kijashu boulder that has been briefly discussed earlier. The shelter also occurs within the Mwiba wildlife ranch about, 3-4 km from Nyungu rock shelter. Gululu is Maasai name and the site is located near the river named Gululu from which the name of the site and the area was given. The site is positioned at 03° 31’ 618” S and 034° 53’ 376” E. The site had an elevation of 1,720 m a.s.l. The area around the site is dominated by rocky terrain covered with bushes. The shelter is about 6.7 m long, 3.8 m wide and 2.5 m high. The size of the painted area was
10.5	m2. The slope of painted rock is steep about 40-90°. The shelter is exposed to sun in the evening. In the time of the site visit the river was dry and information from the wildlife ranger show that the river dries up during the dry seasons and is full during the wet seasons. Possibly the painters of this art (olpul) had reasons to be near water source during their artistic work. Mkenyela Sananga, the wildlife ranger at Mwiba Holding Ltd, verbally confirmed this. He had the following to say;
The Olpul is the meat-feasting ceremony, which is mainly done, in rainy season usually around March or April. The ceremony involves about ten Maasai worriers (moranis) who organize themselves and contribute one grown fat cow each or two goats for the person who does not have cows... Then they ask two old people (laibons) who have tradional medicines knowledge to accompanying them in the
bush... After reaching the bush they slaughter cows and mix the herbal medicines in the soup. Then feasting of herbal soup and meat begins. Being near source of water helps during meat preparation and cooking... Women are not allowed to participate in olpul... According to our informant usually the olpul ceremony camp is established near shelters, caves or big tree to cover themselves and the meat if it is raining.
The researcher asked the informant if he thinks Maasai made the paintings. He had this to say;
“Maasai drew these paintings in the past... In the past we used to have a lot of shields and we used the shields especially when we went to the bush to fight with the lions... You can see even the paintings with the shields and the warriors (moranis) fighting lions”.
The above information is similar to that reported by Mabulla and Gidna (2014). They conducted an ethnographic enquiry to Mr. Simon Kateyo Matayo aged about 61 years old. The informant reported this;
‘‘When rain starts, lines of bull fats were smeared across the shelter's ceiling on the drip line to prevent drops of rain water to seep into the shelter's floors... In this way, the warriors, their equipment and meat remained dry... According to Mr. Mataro, the smeared bull fats could also have worked as a substrate to smoothen the rock surfaces and to bind the paintings... Paintings were done by the moranis during or after the olpul ceremony. They painted on the shelter's walls and ceilings the animals they eat and encountered, the symbols of animals they eat, weapons and humans''.
Gululu rock shelter had two panels with total amount of 38 figures photographed and traced (Figure 8). At this site subject matters include wild animals, domesticated animals, anthropomorphic figures, tools and equipments. Incomplete (broken) figures and unidentified figures were added as subject matter after tracing (Table 5). These incomplete or broken figures were the results of several rock fractures on the rock panel. The figures were executed in monochrome black and biochrome black and dusky-red. Black pigments executed to about 35 (92%) painted figures while only 3 (8%) painted figures were executed in black and dusky-red pigments. All the human, domesticated and wild animal figures were painted in monochrome black. Only weapons (shields) were painted in biochrome black and dusky-red. The black colour was very bright but the dusky-red colour was fainted. The edges and details of figures were clear and excellently preserved. The painted wild animals included lions,
elephant, rhinoceros, and rabbit (Figure 13). Lions were painted in such a way that their sexes could be identified. Male lions were painted in large bodies and with rich and bigger manes. Female lions are small and lack the rich and bigger manes. The elephants were painted in a stylized form particularly, the tail, that was exceedingly painted too long. Like at many Olpul art sites in the Serengeti National Park and NCA, cattle were the only domesticated animals painted at Gululu. Bulls with humps and horns were dominated.

Humans were the most representative figures at Gululu rock shelter. Preliminary analysis showed that human figures dominated amounting to 13 individual figures or 34.2%. Human were depicted carrying various objects, tools and weapons and engaging in a scene associated with domestic or wild animals. In panel two, human figures were painted holding like spear fighting charging lions. Mabulla and Gidna (2014) reported similar observation at one site in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). Also one human individual was depicted fighting or attacked by an animal probably a lion. In panel one, painted were files of walking humans holding like sticks and probably machetes at their waist. One human figure was painted holding up a stick to the cattle. This was interpreted as the grazing scene (Figure 14). In other occasion two humans were painted holding hands. Although their sexes could not be determined but one figure had what was interpreted as machete at the waist. It is known that Maasai women never carry machetes at all. Therefore the other figure could be the female. Hence the scene of cooperation or friendship is depicted. At one site in Serengeti National Park, Mabulla and Gidna (2014) revealed that humans were painted with hands holding on their waist. Initial general analysis of the paintings at Gululu indicated that the action of motion and motionless of the figures were present. At least 11 (42%) of the figures in panel 1 indicated the state of motion. The rest 15 (58%) figures were in motionless.
Figure 14: Human figure in association with a cattle depicting grazing scene
Damage to the rock art included smokes, pecking and scratches. Rock weathering at Gululu panels was high causing most of paintings to faint. Termite growth, bird and mud nest as well as wasp nest occur at panel one. This site is high potential for public display because the
present generation, the Maasai community still uses the shelters for their olpul ceremonies. Although it is not well known if the present generation still does the art or the paintings, future study needs to investigate if during the olpul ceremony the warriors do the paintings. Also to understand what ingredients they use to produce the pigments and the context in which the art was made. Because the paintings are in very good state of preservation it add more value to the art. Because this site occurs within the WMA, if well conserved and promoted it may attract more visitors visiting the park and increase the income of the company that own the ranch but also local, community residing the area share the benefits.
The Gululu rock shelter had evidence of recent human use. Firstly, the shelter was found fenced with trees and thorns at the main entrance (Plate 7). Secondly, inside the shelter just after the fence there were ashes on the ground indicating recent fire use on the shelter’s floor. Thirdly, a wooden table-like covered with grasses on top was found inside the shelter (Plate 8). A fresh hearth or fireplace was found outside the shelter (Plate 9). Clearly, all these indicate recent human habitation at the rock shelter by either poachers or moranis during olpul ceremonies.

During site mapping (Figure 15) we found scatters of lithic materials. However the study did not collect any archaeological materials because it was not the objective of the study. Therefore they were left in in situ for future studies. Generally the site has archaeological deposit and is worthy excavating.

5.2.5	Other field finding
During field survey, our informant took us to another rock shelter named Ze’nape’e (Hadza local name) meaning the “things that a person loves most”. Ze’nape’e granite boulder is located at 03° 32’ 356’’ S and 034° 37’ 231’’. According to our informant, the boulder used to have paintings and the last time when he saw the paintings was in 2003. Yet, we could not observe even a single trace of a painting. The paintings may have been covered by soot from smokes (Plate 10). The soot indicates that the inhabitants lit fire inside the shelter. A bed-like structure made of wooden sticks was found inside the shelter (Plate 10). Perhaps the wooden bed-like structure was used for sleeping on. Also a hearth with three cooking stones was found on the shelter’s floor. Pottery remains and few stone artifacts were found on the floor. Therefore, the site is potential for archaeological excavation that might reveal past human occupation of the site.

CHAPTER SIX
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
6.0 Introduction
This chapter presents site and rock painting analysis, and discussion. Kijashu rock site information such as the nature and positioning of the site as well as its size, site accessibility, view from the site, site orientation, exposure to sunlight and wind, nature of painted surface, height of paintings and visibility of paintings are analyzed in this chapter. Paintings are analyzed and compared with findings from other sites in LVB regions and north-central Tanzania. This is possible by establishing their relationships and variations in terms of subject matters, colour and order of superimposition, chronological sequence of paintings, scenic relationships and state of motion of figures, stylistic characteristics, techniques of paintings execution and traditions. Also discussed are, the state of preservation and conservation and past and present use of the site for sustainable heritage management in order to promote archaeo-tourism.
6.1	Site Analysis
6.1.1	Nature, positioning and size of the boulder
Kijashu rock art site occurs in Maswa Game Reserve, southwest of Serengeti National Park. The site is located in granite rock outcrop on one side of a huge boulder on the southwestern side of the rock outcrop (Plate 11). The site is located at 03° 12’ 21’’ S and 034° 33’ 222’’ E with an elevation of 1,524 m a.s.l. The nature of the site terrain is rocky and is dominated by bushy, thicket vegetation and trees. The boulder is about 14.4 m long, 9 m wide and 12 m high. To the western part of the boulder there is a big rock boulder that protects the site from wind, sun and direct access.
Plate 11: Kijashu rock outcrop surrounded with trees, thickets and dry grasses
Exfoliated rock slabs occur on the floor of the shelter (Plate 12). According to Coulson (2013) these slabs feature a grave (see Plate 12 in red). Nonetheless, my observations of the shelter floor noted that exposed granite bedrocks dominate it with very small areas composed of sediments. Therefore, Coulson’s idea that the exfoliated slabs indicate a burial is rejected. The small areas of sediments within the shelter’s floor had few stone artifacts of LSA cultural affinity and a recent fireplace or hearth. Archaeological excavation of the shelter’s floor is not worthy. This is due to the exposed bedrock covering a large part of the floor. The stone slabs observed on the floor could probably be due to either exfoliation prior to painting or post human activities, especially, since the site has evidence of recent human use. Alternatively, the slabs were brought by the prehistoric authors and used them as ladder or scaffolding during painting executions.
Plate 12: Rock slabs on the floor of the boulder
6.1.2	Site accessibility and outlook
This site is easy to reach although local terrain and vegetation cover resulted to few challenges to locate the site. The panel boulder is obstructed by another boulder to the western side. There were two possible ways to enter to the painting site. There is a corridor from northwest of the overhang that the research crews used to reach the site under the directives of the game ranger (Plate 13). Also, it is possible to enter from the southwest of the boulder, however, tree branches protected direct entrance to the site. Unless tree branches and little vegetation are pruned, access to the site from southwest is limited. The northwest entrance shows more signs of use (preference) than the other one, certainly because of the obstacle mentioned on the other. The study recommends the continuation use of the northwest entrance since any modifications or transformation of the surroundings at the southwest entrance will have negative impacts to the site, particularly, in understanding the occupation history of the area but also changes of site uses over time and space. Hall et al., (2007) noted that the removal (or loss) of trees at rock art sites, largely for visitor purposes, influences ambient thermal and humidity conditions. The change in temperature and moisture at rock art sites can influence weathering mechanisms thereby posing a threat towards conservation of the art.
Plate 13: A game ranger leading the way to enter Kijashu rock painting site
The outlook of the site is hidden by the boulder-facing west. This boulder obstructs people standing outside to have a direct view to the site. But also, people standing within the site do not have a commanding view of the surrounding areas. The only way of having a commanding view of the surrounding area is to standing on the boulder, which obstructs the site
6.1.3	Site orientation and exposure to the sun
Kijashu rock art site is northwesterly oriented. This allows partial exposures of the paintings to sunlight in the evening. The western granite boulder adjacent to the site blocks direct sunlight from reaching the site. Hence some parts of the site get sun and others do not get sun at all. Although the boulder blocks direct sunlight to reach the site, the site maintains warmth throughout the day. Scholars have discussed orientation of the site and the preferences on the choice of sites to paint (see Clark 1959; Smith 1995; Mabulla 2005; Namono 2010). Possibly, painters selected Kijashu rock boulder because of its northward orientation and ability to maintain warmth during the night. Clark (1959: 166) asserts that;
Shelters with a north or northwesterly aspect were preferred where the afternoon sun heats up the rock so that the shelter remains warm
and comfortable throughout the greater part of the night, as anyone who has slept in one will know.
However, in Uganda 53.1% of the sites are oriented southerly, 8.0% easterly, 24.8% northerly and 14.1% westerly (Namono 2010). The Red Geometric paintings of Uganda and like those of Zambia occur on sites oriented in south (Smith 1959; Namono 2010). Deliberate selections of southerly sites in Uganda are linked to rain control and fertility (Namono 2010). In Mara region, Tanzania, the majority of geometric painted shelters and overhangs face to the south and east (Mabulla 2005: 36). Although Kijashu site is also geometric painted site, its orientation is contrary from other sites with geometric tradition in Uganda, Zambia and Mara region, Tanzania. This study does not confirm that Kijashu was selected for painting because of its northwesterly orientation in order to take advantage of the afternoon sun heat. It is possible that the site was selected because the adjacent boulder protects it from wind, rain, animals and enemies. The occurrences of few LSA stone artifacts on the floor indicated that the site was used for habitation.
6.1.4	Nature of painted surface, highest and visibility of paintings
Pictographs at Kijashu are executed on the large steep sloping wall of the boulder. The slope of painted surface (wall) of the boulder is steep, about 40-90°. This is quite similar to most painted sites in Mara region. The painted surface is horizontally and vertically flat and smooth. According to Clark (1959: 165), flatness and smoothness of surfaces might have attracted artists to concentrate in these areas. The size of the painted area is about 23.2 m2. In comparison with 14 sites from Mara region, only Nyamang’ora rock shelter 1 and Nyabiterangi rock shelter 1 had biggest sizes of painted area of 46.2 and 40 m2 respectively. The degree of protection of the painted surface was good as the boulder is protected by another huge boulder to the west. Hence receives protection from the afternoon sun and rainfall. A massive stone as a ‘roof’ cover a small part of the boulder’s top. The ‘roof’ protects only the painted surface from direct rainwater drops, though not so significantly as few paintings are faded due to rainwater. Therefore, this site was carefully chosen as it offered a range of factors, which facilitated from initial decorating the surface to protection of art. Scholars have reached into a consensus that prehistoric artists were very careful when choosing areas and surfaces for painting. And since rock art represent their social,
economical and cultural ways of accruing the living, there is no doubt that long-term preservation of the paintings was an issue of great importance.
The highest pictograph was painted at about 2.2 m high, suggesting that painters may have used a ladder or scaffolding when painting. The lowest pictograph was at 23 cm high from the shelter’s floor. The distance in which the paintings can be seen is only within the site. This is because the site is protected on the western side by another boulder.
6.2	Paintings Analysis
The objective of analyzing the paintings is to qualitatively and quantitatively discerns attributes that help to establish the meaning and motives of the painters at Kijashu site. These attributes were later attempted to ascertain similarities and/or differences with rock paintings of other sites within LVB and northern-central Tanzania. The attributes of the analysis have been listed in the methodological section as well as in the introductory part of this section.
6.2.1	Inventory and motifs classification
Inventory of painted figures was done after finalizing tracing of the panels using Adobe
Photoshop C5. A total of 215 figures were analyzed and traced. The results of analysis of
subject matters and inventories are presented in Figure 16.
Kijashu boulder
Figure 16: Subject matters classification and inventories
The figure shows that there are four categorical classification of subject matter at Kijashu site. The subject matters represented are anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and birds.
About 77% (n=166) of the analyzed images were anthropomorphic figures, 11% (n=24) wild animals, 7% (n=15) geometric and 5% (n=10) were birds. Clearly, anthropomorphic figures were the most representative motif at Kijashu rock art site followed by zoomorphic figures. Anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and geometric figures have also been observed at other sites in LVB. Birds are not depicted in many sites in LVB, but they observed in north-central Tanzania.
6.2.1.1	Anthropomorphic figures
Kijashu rock shelter consist at least eight kinds of anthropomorphic. The typical design of the anthropomorphic figures is the “stick-like” design. The design is simple and crude (Figure 17). Some of the human figures are associated with animals. Other human figures are superimposed by geometric designs. Many of the elongated stick-like humans are concentrated on the right part of the painted panel as well as in the middle. Although no interpretation of this has been made, perhaps it was just the choices of painters in utilizing the paintable surface. At least eight types of “stick” human figures are discerned. These include:
(i)	Human “stick” figures without hands and legs,
(ii)	Human “stick” figures with hands,
(iii)	Human “stick” figures with hands and legs,
(iv)	Human “stick” figures in forward bending position,
(v)	Tiny faded human figures in rows,
(vi)	Human “family” figures,
(vii)	The “key” human figure, and
(viii) Bolded human figures
Figure 17: Anthropomorphic figures representation at Kijashu site
Human “stick” figures with no hands and legs
Of the analyzed “stick” anthropomorphic figures, about 19% (n=28) were drawn extremely simple without hands and legs. These figures are simple lines drawn on the panel (Figure 18). Also observed is, a non-hands and legs stick figure in a bending position. This is associated with stick human figures in forward bending positions. Some stick human figures without hands and legs are superimposed by and associated with wild animals and geometric paintings. Generally, these “stick” human figures without hands and legs were 12 to 75 cm tall.
10 cm
Figure 18: Very crude "stick" like human figures
Human “stick” figures with hands
“Stick” human figures with hands were also predominant at Kijashu site. These are figures with either two or one hand and form 24% (n=40) of analyzed human figures. . Significant amount of two handed “stick” figures occur at the left corner of the panel. On top right of the panel also two handed stick human figures as well as one handed stick figures were observed. Also depicted is one stick human figure in bending position. ’’Stick” human figures with hands are associated with wild animals, particularly, at the left side of the panel. Two-handed “stick” human figures, possibly men are superimposed on concentric circles at the centre of the panel. The exceptionally long two handed “stick” human figures at the centre of the panel and which overlap the concentric circle, had visible rounded heads and two of them had spiky heads (Figure 19). These “stick” human figures with hands ranged in size from 20 cm to 100 cm (1 m) long.

Human “stick” figures with hands and legs
Human “stick” figures with hands and legs are well represented in this group. Most of the figures are represented with both hands and others with only one hand but pairs of legs are dominant in both one and two-handed figures. About 37% (n=61) of the analyzed anthropomorphic figures were noted to have these features. These figures were painted on the upper part and left side of the panels close to the birds, on the upper and lower parts of the centre of the panel and on the lower part at the right side of the panel. Although they share the same characteristics, their alignments, heights and depictions on the panel are distinct. Ten “stick” humans with hands and legs occur at the upper part of the left side of the panel. Out of these, six figures and in the same shade of colour have more pronounced hands and
legs (Figure 20). The rest are faded but some elements like hands, legs and heads were observable. These six figures were arranged in a parallel row. They measured to about 25-30 cm tall.

Figure 20: Human "stick" figures with hands and legs
Depicted at the upper part of the central panel were eight human “stick” figures with hands and legs drawn. The figures were drawn in a row (Figure 21). The lower section of the legs retain a linear form while the upper part notably the heads increase in parallel way. Nonetheless, these figures were painted in a vertical plane on the panel. In terms of height, these eight elongated “stick” stick human figures measured to 28 cm long.

Human “stick figures” in forward bending positions
About 4% (n=7) of the analyzed anthropomorphic figures were painted in forward bending positions facing left (Figure 22). These “stick” and attenuated human figures were 70-90 cm tall. They are painted with hands and legs, but some lack these features. Simple but hard curved lines interpreted as forward bending position characterize the group. The authors of the art may have done intentionally with specific representational in the mind. The bending position of the “stick” human figures may have two interpretations. Scholars relate the human’s forward bending position with shamanistic activities such as dancing and singing (Lewis-Williams 1981). The forward bending dance position is adopted as trance energy begins to boil and the intensity of trance increases. When this dance position is adopted, normally it is also performed with sticks (Lewis-Williams 1981). These figures were painted at the very end of the rock panel. Possibly the artists took an advantage of the bending rock surface to fit the paintings on the panel.

Tiny faded humans in row
About 10% (n=16) of the analyzed anthropomorphic figures were tiny and faded “stick” humans arranged in a row (Figure 23). These occur on the upper central part of the panel and are smaller than any of the human figures types. They are approximately 8 cm tall. These tiny figures were depicted in a group of 16 arranged in a single file. Some figures had small hands and legs.
Figure 23: Tiny human figures in parallel line
Human “family” figures
About 2% (n=3) of all analyzed anthropomorphic figures represent a family. These three human figures occur in the upper part of the central panel. They are facing to the left and painted in motion. They are not associated with any figure and are about 4 cm to 9 cm tall (Figure 24). One of the figures was much faded. I had to use the ImageJ (DStretch Plugin) software that helped in visualizing fainted colours. Otherwise it was difficult to see it. That is why Coulson (2013) could not identify this image. As a result he presented only two figures noted in darker red pigment. This author argues that these three human figures represent “family”. Accordingly, front and short human figure is a child. The second in the row and in the middle is a mother and the last one is a father. In daily and traditional African life when on safari on foot, the child always walks in front of the parents. A mother follows the child and the father acting as a “caretaker” of the family walks behind of all.
Figure 24: Three individuals human figures
The “key” human figure
Only one figure equal to 1% of all analyzed human images was depicted alone like a key human figure (Figure 25). The figure was well executed in association with geometric designs. The “key” human figure was executed with head and hands connected to geometric designs notably, circles and circles with externally radiating lines or “sun-like” designs. To the bottom part the key human figure has circular legs. This “key” human figure is 42 cm long and 8 cm breadth. In comparison with the “stick” human figures with hands and legs, the “key” human figure is noted to have a slightly broader body, stretched arms (hands) and a pronounced head. The majority of “stick” human figures had bodies that are about 2.5 cm broad.
Figure 25: A "key" human-like design
Bolded human figures
Results of analysis indicate that about 3% (n=4) of the anthropomorphic figures were depicted in very thick paste of the same colour referred to as bolded human figures (Figure 26). The finished piece of art is generally poor although some element of hands and legs could be clearly seen. Nevertheless one figure lacked these features. Two of the bolded human figures occur in the upper left part of the panel, one occur in the upper central part of the panel on top of 16 very small human figures and the rest occur in the upper right end of the rock panel. The bodies especially, of the two figures are broad while the legs and arms are
thin compared to the bodies. The head is represented only on one figure. Therefore, the rest of the bolded human figures lack the anatomical features as well as proportions.

“Stick” human designs are less representative in many sites in LVB compared to Kijashu site. Three “stick” human figures have been reported in Mara region at Nyamang’ora rock shelter 2 and Nyabiterangi rock shelter 1 (see Mabulla 2005). Most of the sites from north-central and central Tanzania lack these motifs. However, similar “stick” images have been reported in the Matopo Hills World Heritage Site, in Zimbabwe (see Coulson 2013).
6.2.1.2	Wild animals
Wild animals are also numerous at Kijashu rock art site. Big, medium and small sized animals are depicted. They are depicted in semi naturalistic and stylized styles. Depicted animals include giraffes, possibly lion, hartebeests, buffalo, warthogs and other indeterminable animals (Figure 28). Giraffes (46%, n=11) were the most common animals depicted on the panel.

Figure 28: Wild mammals
Giraffes were semi-naturalistically drawn some with short necks and others with long necks. Those painted with short necks probably are young giraffes. Six giraffes were painted in linear facing right, on the left side of the panel. On the upper central panel, one giraffe with extremely long neck was painted facing also right. At least four giraffes in the upper and middle part of the panel were drawn facing left on the right side of the panel. Three giraffes were painted with their heads down indicating browsing or grazing activities. The predominance of giraffes at Kijashu site indicates that painters favoured them. The reason for this is unclear. Some scholars argue that may have been preferred for hunting because of their big game meat. Prehistoric painters would have favoured giraffes because they offer pretty meat for the entire group. Hadzabe hunter-foragers prefer to hunt big games. Once they kill a big game, it takes them up to three days to consume the meat and without going out again for
the hunt. This reduces the hunting load to hunters. Other scholars argue that big games such as giraffes, elands and play a special role during ritual ceremonies. For example, big game is potential sources of ritual meat for Hadzabe hunter-forager’s epeme dance (Marlowe 2010). Prehistoric painters at Kijashu site may have painted giraffes as a favoured animal as a source of big game meat for consumption and ritual.
Kijashu site is located within the Maswa GR, a part of the Serengeti Ecosystem. The high representation of giraffes in the rock art may suggest that these animals were widely available. For example, Mahudi (2008) commented that some animals were painted because they were frequently seen in the area and thus marking their signatures on the rocks. This statement may correspond with the observation at Kijashu. Favourable depiction of giraffes may also have connection with the society’s myth, belief system and ideology as it is for the eland in South Africa (Mahudi 2008). This is seen among the community in Botswana in which giraffe plays an important role in the ritual and folklore practices (Bisele 1993; Bendera, 2011 in Itambu 2013). Moreover, the predominance of giraffes in the art can be associated with aesthetic purposes, which attracted the painters. Consequently, depictions of giraffes at Kijashu may had central important roles to the community at large.
About 25% of the analyzed animals could not be identified (Figure 29, images 1 to 6). Coulson (2013) identified these animals as cattle. They were drawn with tiny heads but also lacking anatomical details such as humps, horns and tails. Cattle in Africa exist in different kinds. They may be divided according to the presence or absence of a hump, possession of long or short horns and/or combinations of these two characteristics arising from hybridization. Rock art studies in eastern Africa show that the region contains rock paintings of domesticated cattle. These include stylized depictions of domesticated long-horned humpless cattle and short-horned cattle with humps (Wright 1961; Odak 1976; Odak 1977 in Schmidt 2001). In Sudanese, Somalian, Eritrean and Ethiopian rock art, depiction of longhorned humped, long-horned humpless and short-horned humpless cattle are dominant. The study by Nado (2011) in southwestern Madagascar identified humped horn and humpless horn cattle at the site of Ampasimaiky rock shelter (ARS). In LVB, all the recorded sites have cattle depicted with horns. In north-central Tanzania, a short-horned humpless cattle was recorded at one site (Mabulla and Gidna 2014, Figure 29). As such horns or humps are the most important possessions for the African cattle species. Therefore, this author thinks that there is insufficient evidence to support cattle representation at Kijashu as argued by Coulson
(2013).
Figure 29: Short-horned humpless cattle
6.2.1.3	Birds
Birds are very rare in the rock paintings of LVB. A flying bird was reported at Nyamang'ora rock shelter 1, Mara region by Mabulla (2005). Nonetheless, the study could not identify the type of the depicted flying bird. At Kijashu rock art site the only birds represented are ostriches. A group of 10 ostriches are drawn on the upper left part of the panel and all facing to the right side. With the exception of one, the rest were drawn with missing legs. The necks and bodies were depicted very proportionally and in great detail that enabled easy identification. Their elongated necks were painted in a forward bending postures showing that they were painted in motion (Figure 30).

Figure 30: Ostriches in a group of ten
Recent studies in central and north-central Tanzania recorded depictions of ostriches (Mahudi 2008; Mabulla and Gidna 2014; Figure 31). In central Tanzania the site was at Nkinto Village, Iramba District just about 3.6 km from Isanzu mission. Despite such recent discoveries, birds are still very rare in the paintings, represented only by owls, ostriches, eagles and bats (see Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Kijashu site might be the only site with high representation of birds/ostriches in the country. As said earlier, this site occurs in the Serengeti National Park that is known as home of many animal and bird species. Among the bird species, there are a lot of ostriches in Maswa GR. This brings back the theory that depiction of animals and other figures depended on their frequency and occurrence in the landscapes.

6.2.1.4	Geometric figures
At Kijashu painting site, the geometric designs include concentric circles, concentric circles with externally radiating lines, semi circles, curved dots, curved lines, circles with externally radiating lines or sun-like designs, ladder-like designs, and oval shapes (Figure 32). The dominant designs are the concentric circles with externally radiating rays occurring at the centre of the panel. The concentric circles were fainted especially the medium sized ones which were very hard to observe and trace. The concentric circles had varying diameters of 11-32 cm. Furthermore, the circles were varying from four to six circles. Two concentric circles had their externally radiating lines faded, but also not covering the entire circumference whilst the three concentric circles lacked this feature. Two circles with externally radiating lines or “sun-like” design were also depicted on the panel. These figures had 9-16 externally radiating rays. The “key” human figure described earlier is associated with five circles and ovals. Some of the circles have externally radiating rays or “sun-like” designs (Figure 32).
Geometric figures are widely represented in the rock art of Tanzania (see Chaplin 1974; Masao 1976; Mabulla 2005; Bendera 2011; Itambu 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). In LVB, sites in Mwanza, Bukoba and Mara are well distributed with these designs. At Yakok and Nyakira in Mwanza Gulf, concentric circles with externally radiating lines were documented similarly to those observed at Kijashu (Figure 33). Although the concentric circles at Yakok had filled-in-dots at the centre, the Kijashu concentric circles lack this feature. Nonetheless, at both sites, the externally radiating lines do not cover the entire circumferences of the circles. In Mara region geometric figures were the most representative occurring at many sites (see Mabulla 2005). At Nyamang’ora rock shelter 1 and 2, Nyakingi and Nyagogo rock shelters. The dominant motifs are concentric circles with external radiating lines and dots at the centre and oval shapes (Figure 34). At Nyamang’ora rock shelter 1, the concentric circles were very large having up to 10 circles and a maximum diameter of 57 cm (Mabulla 2005). This is unlike those observed at Kijashu and in Mwanza Gulf. Nevertheless, Kijashu and Mara concentric circles are vey similar in many aspects. Similar concentric circles have also been recorded in Bukoba rural and Muleba districts (see Chaplin 1974; Leakey 1983; Anati 1986; Mturi and Bushozi 2002; Kwekason and Chami 2003).

Some scholars have argued that geometric designs portray a range of meteorological phenomena (Collinson 1970; Kenny 1976; Phillipson 1976; Willcox 1984; Prins and Hall 1994; Smith 1997, Mabulla 2005). Circles, concentric circles with externally radiating lines and semi-circles with radiating lines are argued to represent either the sun, stars, or moon. This weather and/or astronomical divinations hypothesis is supported by the fact that sites with such geometric paintings function as sacred gathering places for rain making and other ritual activities in different parts of Africa (Nooter 1986; Smith 1997). Mabulla (2005) conducted an ethnographic enquiry at Nyabiterangi rock shelter 1. His key informant had this to report:
“Nyabiteragi rock shelter 1 was used as rainmaking ritual site until the early part of post independence era in Tanzania”.
Namono (2010: 142) associated most of rock art site with geometric motifs as magical places for rain-control ceremonies. She had this to comment about such ceremonies;
“It is probable that because rock paintings are believed to have been
made by the ancestors, their antiquity and association are powerful; making sites with rock art such as Nyero, enhance the power of the rainmaker. This does not imply that rock art was made in the context of rain-control but that it is now used in such a context”.
Smith (1995) pointed out that the geometric designs, especially concentric circles are always associated with fertility. This interpretation is supported by ethnographies of some cultures in eastern, central, and southern Africa that continue to use some geometric designs in fertility contexts. For instance the Bemba of northern Zambia, draw concentric circles on walls of girls’ initiation huts during Chisungu (van Riet Lowe 1937: 411; Richards 1956: 106; Corbeil 1982: 40 in Smith 1995). Finally her future husband has to shoot an arrow into the centre of the drawn circle. By this act, the husband claims his bride and the act symbolically seems to represent the penetration and fertilization of the girl who now becomes a woman (Smith 1995). Also in northeast Angola, concentric circles are used as fertility tattoos (Redinha 1948: 6 in Smith 1995).
In summary, the paintings of Kijashu site are dominated by anthropomorphic figures as discussed earlier “stick” human figures with no hands and legs, “stick” human figures with hands, “stick” human figures with hands and legs, “stick” human figures in forward bending position, tiny and faded human figures in rows, “family” human figures, a “key” human figure and humans in bolded forms. Also represented are animals including giraffes, possibly a lion, warthog, hartebeest, and other unidentified animals, which are argued, may probably represent elands in some context. Ostriches are the only birds painted at the site. Geometric figures found are concentric circles with externally radiating lines or dots, circles with externally radiating lines or “sun-like” shapes, semi circles, curved and dotted lines and simple lines. Such geometric designs are said to be associated with rain control and fertility rituals in different parts of Africa. Possibly, this may have been the case at Kijashu, yet, an ethnographic enquiry is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis. The typological table of motif identification and classification of Kijashu site paintings is presented in Table 6.

6.2.2	Scenic relationship and state of motion
In his study of Later Stone Age and the Rock Paintings of Central Tanzania, Masao identified scenic relationships between images. He categorized the relationships into three: the relationships of cooperation, opposition and neutral. The scenes of opposition may be of fighting or animals attacking humans and vice versa. The cooperation scenes involve dancing, hunting, files of walking humans and others.
At Kijashu a scene of cooperation was observed. Some anthropomorphic figures were painted in files or in groups, portraying scenes of cooperation. At the top left of the panel close to birds a file of 10 “stick” human figures with outstretched hands, motionless legs and round heads occur. These “stick” human figures painted in a single file probably were drawn performing different kinds of ritual activities or dancing. At the top centre of the panel, a group of eight associated individuals with hands and legs were drawn depicting certainly a dancing scene. Probably the best dancing scene is the depictions of the elongated and forward bending human figures. Also the three human figures interpreted as father, mother and child were depicted walking as their legs are outstretched forwardly. It has been previously stated that birds were drawn with missing legs but their heads bending forward. This may suggest were painted in motion, possibly running. Also the six giraffes painted at the left side of the
panel in a single file and right were possibly painted in motion and probably in search of either pastures or water.
6.2.3	Colour and overlapping
In describing the colour of the paintings, a Munsell Colour chart was used. Painting analysis and fieldwork observations show Kijashu paintings were depicted in monochrome. Paintings were executed in monochrome red of variations shades such as dusky-red, light red and orange or reddish yellow. Dusky red pigments dominated and formed about 79% of the painted figures. Light-red and orange (reddish yellow) pigments formed about 14% and 7% of the paintings, respectively. Anthropomorphic figures and few animals were painted in dusky red. Birds, giraffes and few “stick” human figures were executed in light red. The early geometric figures were painted in dusky-red and light red. The later geometric figures were executed in orange or reddish yellow. The paintings in orange or reddish yellow were more visible and easy to trace than figures in light red, especially, the giraffes, some unidentified figures and few “stick” human figures located on the left and central part of the panel. The “stick” human figures on top left, top central and central parts of the panel were traceable. The interpreted “family” human figures and one animal figure were painted in very bright dusky red that were well preserved than most of the figures of such kind. Namono (2010: 243) suggested that variations within the red colour (dusky red, light red and orange/reddish yellow) might be a result of either pigment fading and bleeding through time or mixing of core pigments with other soils or contaminants.
Kijashu site has complex superimposition of many painted figures (Figure 35; Table 7). Superimpositions of paintings dominate at the centre the panel. Such overlaps of images on the panel made it harder to identify the sequences of paintings and analyzing them. The analyses of paintings indicate that anthropomorphic figures overlapped many other figures. The light red giraffes and other animals were overlaid by dusky and light red “stick” human figures at the left side of the panel. The head of the giraffe overlay the concentric circle. Also at the centre of the panel, an unidentified animal (elands?) and a concentric circle are overlaid by the “stick” human figures. On the right side of the panel, two concentric circles with externally radiating lines are also overlaid by the stick human figures. In turn, both the concentric circles and the “stick” human figures are superimposed by the geometric designs (lines, ovals and circles). Tracing of paintings to show details and clarity of superimposition
figures is shown in Figure 35. Although the tracing colours are not as those painted on the panel, the aim objective was to show the sequence of superimpositions.

6.2.4	Paintings sequence
Namono (2010) acknowledge that time depth between one painting episode and another is difficult to determine, it may be the same day, same year or thousands of years. Whitley (2005: 55) went further by admitting that superimposition sequences may not primarily be a function of age but what is clear is that one episode was painted after another. Therefore, superimposition may not only reflect time depth, but may also reflect cultural associations where over-painting describes relationships between motifs or colours (Namono 2010).
Based on superimpositions of paintings, at least four painting episodes are discernible on the panel (Figure 36). The concentric circles with externally radiating lines and other concentric circles represent the first painting phase at Kijashu. In the same first phase painted were also few animals, a total of 20 small human figures as well as three individuals figures (A “family” human figures) all in dusky red. The majority of animals and birds represent the second phase all in light red. The third phase is represented by light-red “stick” human figures that overlay concentric circle with externally radiating lines, concentric circles, and animals. Phase four is represented by geometric motifs in orange or reddish yellow, which overlay concentric with externally radiating line, concentric circles and “stick” human figures.

6.2.5	Stylistic and techniques of execution
According to Masao (1982), styles are the collective characteristics of the art of a given culture that include motifs, techniques and forms. Thus, styles define groupings of paintings and help to understand the motives behind their application. Semi-naturalistic, stylized and geometric styles are the styles found at Kijashu. Animals are represented in semi-naturalistic although some are stylized. Paintings of animals are completely or partially filled-in with the same shade of colours of dusky and light red. Few animals are outlined shaded with dots vividly seen on the “unidentified/elands? animals. Giraffes are semi-naturalistically painted with very tiny legs and in most occasions only two legs are painted. Giraffes also missed tails. Also semi-naturalistically painted are ostriches. The other unidentified animals are
highly stylized missing some anatomical features such as legs, tails, heads and/or horns that made even their identification become complicated.
Stylization is seen best in human figures all across the rock art zones in the country (Masao 1976; Mabulla 2005; Mahudi 2008, Bendera 2011; Itambu 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Also at Kijashu site human figures are painted in stylized forms. Humans are painted in very simple forms or in red thin straight lines like “sticks”. The heads are rounded and missing facial features. Sometimes a slight concavity on one side of the face is seen. Other human figures have rounded heads with spiky. Heads are painted very close to hands/arms but joined to rest of the bodies by simple strokes. Some human figures lacked hands while others are painted with either one or two hands. The arms are usually short, protruding and outstretched sideways but facing down. They are also slightly thicker at the shoulder to the lower part joining the trunk. As seen before, human figures are depicted with legs and some lacking legs. The legs are thicker near the waist. Legs are outstretched sideways. Most of the human figures are painted in motionless. Only the three human “family” figures are with legs outstretched forward to show that they are in motion.
Masao (1976) considered the geometric designs to fall under the non-outline styles. He argued that the subject matter is so varied that it defies proper description. The non-outline representation includes different geometric motifs of lines, circles, square, dots and nongeometric signs and symbols (Masao 1979). At Kijashu site similar motifs were documented. This study observed three general categories of geometric motifs depicted. They fall under circular/hemispherical/oval shapes, lines/strokes and abstracts. Abstracts are dragon like pictures that are impossible to understand which represent neither animals nor geometrics (Masao 1979). These figures are also apparent at Kijashu boulder
6.2.6	Rock art traditions at Kijashu
Depending on subject matters, pigments and style manner of depiction a rock art tradition can be suggested. The study also compared subject matters, styles and execution techniques from other rock art regions so as to achieve this goal. In reaching this objective, the study was guided by Mabulla and Gidna (2014) chrono socio-economic framework in studying the paintings. The adopted socio-economic framework was analyzed and compared with the established traditions from regions of LVB. In north-central Tanzania, Mabulla and Gidna (2014) recognized four rock art traditions namely Hunter-Foragers Art, Pastoral art, Bantu-
Language-Speaker Art or Late White Art, and Maasai Olpul Art. The Hunter-Foragers Art tradition is sub-divided into two categories: (i)“Hunter-Forager Figurative Fine Line” (H-F, FFL) and (ii) the “Hunter-Forager Red Geometric” (H-F, RG). According to Mabulla and Gidna (2014) where H-F, FFL and H-F, RG art occur together, usually RG paintings overlie FFL paintings suggesting that FFL paintings are relatively older than RG paintings. This H-F, FF-L art depicted mostly wild animals in naturalistic and semi-naturalistic forms and humans in stylized form. The H-F, RG art is dominated by depictions of geometric designs. Typical designs include circles, concentric circles, circles with externally radiating lines, circles surrounded by ordered lines of dots, semi-circles, dots, divided circles, ladders, lines, and sets of horizontal and vertical lines. These were painted in various shades of red color executed with fine line by using brushes. The subject matters analyzed and presented in this study clearly suggest that Kijashu site belongs to H-F, RG Art tradition. It is dominated by geometric figures, concentric circles, circles with externally radiating lines or “sun-like” designs, oval shapes, and abstraction designs which scholars have attributed these figures to dragons. Wild animals and “stick” human figures are also painted at Kijashu. In Eyasi Basin the predominant H-F, RG is accompanied with few wild animals and “stick”-like human figures (Mabulla and Gidna 2014). This observation is opposite to what is seen at Kijashu where “stick”-like human figures dominated.
This rock art tradition is also predominant in other regions of LVB. In Mwanza Gulf the tradition is distributed in areas of Yakok or Mamba Island and Nyakira (see Chaplin 1974). H-F RG art also occur in Bukoba rural district and Muleba (Chaplin 1974; Mturi and Bushozi 2002; Kwekason and Chami 2003). In Mara region this tradition is predominant occurring at many sites with common subject matters resembling the Kijashu (see Mabulla 2005). Apart from LVB this tradition is similarly found in Eyasi Basin, southern and central Tanzania (Masao 1976; Leakey 1983; Anati 1986; Itambu 2013 Mabulla and Gidna 2014).
The RG tradition is also widely distributed in central and other countries in eastern Africa. Studies show that this art occur in Angola, Zambia, Malawi, northern Mozambique, and extend northwards through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania as previously seen. Most of studies in these zones have attributed the Red Geometric tradition to the “Batwa” or “Twa” communities who are believed to be the descendant of hunter-gatherers (Clark 1959; Smith 1997; Namono 2010; Coulson 2013). Furthermore, researches have suggested that the central African Batwa were related
physically and culturally to the modern-day Pygmies hunter-gatherers of the Congo region who decorate bark cloth and their bodies with the geometric designs (Smith 1997; 2005; 2006: 89). Although these studies have linked the art with the present population groups, yet, this direct linkage is still debated. This study, however, does not focus on this debate, but rather it suggests that RG painters of Kijashu site were hunter-gatherers.
At Kijashu site some animals were unidentified. The study by Coulson (2013) identified these animals as cattle. But also Coulson suggested two traditions at this site. The RG Tradition similarly to what this study had suggested but also the later Pastoral Art Tradition. According to him elongated “stick” figures, giraffes and cattle paintings are from Pastoral Art. Nonetheless, this author has a different opinion to what Coulson observed. Previously, this author argued that there are no cattle representations at Kijashu. The study is aware that domesticated cattle might be highly stylized. Nonetheless, studies from elsewhere, like Ethiopia, Eritrea and Madagascar where cattle are highly stylized still have retained some anatomical features like horns or humps which someone could easily identify the cattle. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the purported cattle at Kijashu.
Furthermore, painting phases at Kijashu and the order of superimposition clearly indicate that giraffes and the unidentified animals (“cattle” according to Coulson 2013) were almost painted during the same span of time. These are overlain by the “stick” human figures. This author argues that domestics such as cattle could not be painted at the same time span as giraffes or wild animals. Pastoralist Art tradition is a very rare tradition. In East Africa, a few pastoralist group developed rock art tradition that occur at few sites (Namono 2010; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Where it occurs, paintings of domesticated animals such as humped and humpless bovids (cattles) and ovicaprids (sheeps and goats) constitute the subject matters (Namono 2010; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Kijashu site lack these motifs and therefore, the site's paintings does not qualify to belong to the Pastoral Art Tradition.
6.2.7	Chronology of paintings
The age of rock art of Tanzania like many countries in Africa is still patchy. No secure dates have been established in Tanzania. As such, most of the painting's ages are established through relative dating of associated archaeological findings and climatic episodes (Whitley 2005; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). “Relative dates can also be established by observing similarities/differences in the manner of depictions and techniques that may suggest a
common authorship” (Namono 2010). For example, images can be discerned as natural objects that can be placed within a particular period and hence provide relative dating of rock art (Namono 2010).
This study neither collected pigments for absolute dating nor conducted archaeological excavations to retrieve dateable materials for dating the paintings by association. As said earlier, Kijashu site is not worthy excavating because it lacks archaeological deposits. Thus studying the pigments will be the only solution to understand the chronology. Nevertheless, since the rock art of Kijashu belong to H-F, RG Art Tradition, I argue that LSA hunterforagers executed the paintings. At Mumba rock shelter in central Tanzania LSA materials have been recovered from Bed V in direct association with remains of modern fauna assemblage, large quantity of land snail shell, ostrich eggshell fragments and beads, red ochre fragments, ochre pencils, palettes and grinders with traces of red colours (Prendergast et al., 2007). The bones and ostrich eggshell from middle Bed V and upper Bed V were dated to about 45,000-60,000 years ago by uranium series and amino acid racemization (aar) (Mehlman 1989; McBrearty and Brooks 2000, cited in Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Recent dating of Mumba Bed V archaeological deposits by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) indicated that the deposits are old as 49,000 to 60,000 years ago (Gliganic et al., 2012). Mabulla and Gidna (2014) suggest that the H-F, FFL rock paintings of central and north-central Tanzania may have been executed from 60,000 years ago to the present. However, on the basis of subject matter and style, I consider the paintings of Kijashu to be younger than those of north-central and central Tanzania.
6.2.8	Threats to the rock painting's sustainability and management approaches
It has been noted by researchers that rock art studies in Tanzania place much attention towards understandings of the meanings, styles and subject matters of paintings andless emphasis on the integrity and survival of these priceless treasures (Mabulla 2005; Bwasiri 2008; Itambu 2013). Field observations noted effects of weathering on the rock art panel at Kijashu to be very high. Weathering has been explained as an ongoing process and without lasting preservation methods deterioration of the rock will continue as it is exposed to weathering agents. Environmental agents that accelerates rock art weathering are wind, sunlight, temperature, rain and moisture (Warcheid and Braams 2000). These agents encourage both physical and chemical weathering processes. These environmental agents
leading to physical and chemical weathering affect the stability of the rock matrix and corrosion of the rock causing oxidation and hydration reactions (Keller 1957). Micro-cracks or strains are apparent on Kijashu rock surface due to ongoing chemical and physical weathering. These ultimately result in the decay of rock art paintings (Keller 1957). This prevails at Kijashu rock art site. Kijashu roof is not well protected allowing water to run down through the rock surface and over the paintings in some parts. This has caused whitish crusts or layers, which have covered some paintings at the centre of the panel. Where surface water run-off occurs regularly, mosses, fungi and lichens may grow (Leuta 2009). It is important to be aware that running water not only dissolves soluble pigments, causing paintings to fade, but can also deposit minerals on the surface that may cover the art (Batchelor 1990). At Kijashu rock shelter the majority of paintings have faded due to surface water run-off. This, together with chemical and physical weathering, the rock panel is highly weathered causing the colour of the rock to change and fracture.
All rock art sites in Tanzania are not fenced to protect them. This complies with UNESCO's regulations. Nonetheless, sites are vulnerable from small and larger animals that can cause damage to rock art. Small animals such as lizards, birds and rock hyraxes are the main threats to the rock art of Tanzania due to their droppings. In central, north-central and southern Tanzania this is a great challenge to the sustainability of the paintings. This threat also occurs at Kijashu rock art site. Furthermore, Prinsloo (2007) observed that accumulation of excreta by animals such as rock hyraxes in deposits may enrich rising groundwater in organic compounds, including urea, which possible consequent slat influx through the rock that deteriorate the paintings from the ground. However, this is not the case at Kijashu rock art site as no animal droppings were observed on the floor.
Preservation and conservation of rock art may indeed ensure that this fragile heritage asset has log term survival. Complete preservation of rock art is in most instances not possible (Mirmehdi et al., 2001) since the weathering processes on the rock surface will remain active (Walderhaug 1998). Thus deterioration of the art is inevitable. Therefore, there is a need for good conservation and management programmes for rock art sites. Recently, studies on management of rock art sites in Tanzania have been initiated (Bwasiri 2008, Mabulla upcoming). These management and conservation approaches and strategies will hopefully save the rock art heritage. The relevance strategies and approaches are presented in the following sub-sections:
6.2.8.1	Recording
“Recording is to rock-art what digging is to archaeology-the process where much of information and documentation is collected, including all the details and data that will enable the analyses and the study of the site or the area” (Abreu 2013: 319). Information and all kinds of elements that can help to locate, describe, characterize and classify a site need to be taken into account. Abreu (2013) comments that, the site name, administrative details, and collection of any relevant facts like legends, stories and ceremonies associated with the site should be properly recorded. Site's geographical information should be gathered and stored in Geographic Positioning System (GPS) for reference at any time needed.
In Tanzania, most of rock art researches including this study, point out that LVB is the second area with dense concentration of rock painting sites. Yet, most of the sites are not fully documented. Furthermore, detailed and updated descriptions of the paintings are nonexistence. The LVB is topographically significant to rock art studies because it is rich in rocks with suitable surfaces for painting. Therefore, more surveys to document new sites and, re-recording and re-documenting the old sites are crucial to save the art but also to ensure the correctness of information reported by legends.
6.2.8.2	Documentation
This entails using all means that will help to have a full picture of the site. This should be accomplished by using as many techniques as possible. Importantly, is to document all the site's information with minimal site and heritage damage. Hence, sketching or drawing of images by “freehand” without the help of any instrument has to be done and the copying should be close to reality (Abreu 2013). Nowadays digital documentation is highly developed and applied. Photographing by using cameras is widely recommended as the primarily rock art documenting technique. Professionally, photographing of rock art is complicated needing financial resources for proper equipment, logistics and time. Yet, it is one of the best techniques to document and conserve the art. Visiting site more than once may help to understand at what time of the day is suitable for taking a good picture but also controlling light to achieve constructing results. Standard use of scale, i.e. IFRAQ Standard Scale has to be used most of time since it helps to calibrate colours when doing further analysis of paintings.
6.2.8.3	Tracings
This method was first developed in 1950s (see Abreu 2013). This was done by copying the images directly from the wall of the rock shelters, caves and rocks (Abreu 2013). This was employed in copying both engravings and paintings on plastic tracing sheets. In Tanzania, probably even in most countries of Africa tracing of rock art panels have been done on transparent papers. Although results are little bit pleasing (Leakey 1983), most efforts have failed to document all images on the panels due to time constraints and lack of expertise. The other shortcomings of tracing are that it is impossible to show overlaps. In Tanzania, tracing has only been done to show prominent scenes and recognizable figures while ignoring unclear figures and superimpositions. The age of computers is facilitating documentation and tracing is becoming easier although training is required. Developments of image processing softwares such as ImageJ (DStretch Plugin), ASRix, Autocad, and Adobe Photoshop have contributed to the production of high quality images for study and documentation. Tracing is now being done in the laboratory with computers and drawing touchpads, which technically trace precisely the paintings and engravings and identifies overlies. In this study, ImageJ (DStretch Plugin) and Adobe Photoshop C5 softwares facilitated the tracing of most presented figures. The better the painting’s photos the best are the tracing results. The photos and tracing works can be stored or exhibited in museums, universities and at respective sites and can be used for publications of journal papers and posters
6.2.8.4	Training and education
To achieve the presented rock art management and conservation strategies, training, education and publicity need to be addressed by researchers. These should be complemented with seminars, presentations, vigorous fieldworks and visits. Partnerships and collaborations with internal and external Universities, Museums and Research Centres responsible or working in preservation, conservation and management programmes of rock art sites need to be encouraged. The best rock art conservation practices are long-term commitments to conveying messages to people of all ages that this art heritage is a fragile, priceless and irreplaceable resource, which needs to be treasured and preserved for future generations (Leuta, 2009). Awareness by people about the values, rarity and fragility of art heritage will compel them to respect and conserve it. In Tanzania, the government institutions responsible for cultural heritage management believe that local people have nothing to play for the sustainable management of cultural heritage (Itambu 2013). They have forgotten their role to
educate the local community about the scientific, aesthetic and economic values of cultural heritage resources (Itambu 2013). Therefore, this lack of education has resulted in ignorance, causing the local people to vandalize rock art sites and paintings. Through public education and awareness campaigns we will be able to combat vandalism and save this rock art heritage from vanishing.
6.2.8.5	On-site management
For conservation purposes, the most vulnerable or badly damaged sites from vandalism should be closed to the public, while the less damaged sites need to be protected in a more visitor-friendly manner. A site without any type of protection should not be suddenly “visible” (Abreu 2013). Also taking the same route every time when visiting the site should be avoidable. It has been suggested by other specialists that it is great to have a trained guide who knows the area when the site frequently receives visitors. In such cases preparing the site for visitors must consider the preservation of the area. At sites, lectures to visitors should cover the significance of rock art preservation and conservation, visitor regulations (do’s and don’t do’s) and the types of paintings. Prior information about the rock paintings and sites should be given to 'visitors. This means the qualified personnel should be employed to manage these sites, particularly, those with archaeo-tourism significance like those of central Tanzania, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Serengeti National Park and north-central Tanzania. This should also be the case to all the sites found in this study, which fall within the Maswa GR.
6.2.8.6	Laws and legislation enforcement
Law and guidelines to protect rock art heritage against vandalism need to be established and/or enforced. Why do I put more emphasis on rock art heritage? Everywhere in the world rock art is more perilous than the rest of cultural heritages. In Tanzania dynamiting rock shelters and unprofessionally excavating shelter deposits in search for “Germany” treasures is rampant. People believe that colonialists, particularly, Germans buried treasures when fleeing the colony after Word War I (WWI). According to the “treasure hunter” myth, paintings on shelters signify buried “treasures” in rock shelters. In north-central Tanzania alone, treasure hunters have illegally and unprofessionally excavated about 30% of recorded and documented rock painting sites (Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Similar vandalism to rock art sites and paintings have also been reported in other parts of Tanzania (Leakey 1983; Itambu 2013).
With the establishment and/or enforcement of to prohibit the ongoing unprofessional excavating of shelters with paintings in searching for treasures, the cultural and environmental data during when the paintings were made can be saved. Nevertheless, this should be accompanied by educating people about the “treasure hunter” myth does not exist. Although rock art vandalism, such the excavation of floor deposit was not found at Kijashu, it is worthy discussing this for the survival of the rock at of Tanzania in general.
6.2.9	Present and ancient use of Kijashu site
Observations on the shelter's floor revealed cultural materials ranging from LSA to the present. Stone artifacts of LSA tradition on the floor reveal that LSA hunter foragers inhabited the site. Yet, the presences of recent hearths indicate that the site is also being used in modern times (Plate 15). According to our ranger informant, poachers used Kijashu as hideout more than 10 years ago. Probably, poachers made the recent hearths. No remains of material cultures indicating either ritual or religious ceremonies were found at Kijashu site. Nevertheless the geometric designs on the panel may indicate ritual divine power the site had and probably practiced by ancient people. Currently, the site is undisturbed with modern peoples' activities. This is because the site occurs within the GR area hence, human influence in the game reserve is limited.

6.2.10	Potentials of Kijashu rock art site for archaeo-tourism
Archaeo-tourism deals with visiting archaeological sites, places of historical importance or interests, places of cultural interests, museums and art galleries (Holt- Biddle, 1999). It is a component of cultural heritage tourism, and is concerned with management and promotion of sites and engagement of communities. The evaluation of rock art site and the contribution to archaeo-tourism is a wide subject that may require an independent study. Yet, this study presents just an overview, which Kijashu rock art site may contribute to the development of archaeo-tourism in Simiyu region.
Simiyu region largely depends on the cash crops, livestocks and available natural resources to support her economy. Agropastoralism is the main economic activity people depend on for their livelihoods. Besides agropastoralism, tourism in Maswa GR, Makao WMA and Mwiba Ranch contribute directly to the income of the region and countrywide. Maswa GR is home of buffalos, zebras, lions, leopards, roan gazelles, hartebeests, impala and abundance of other large and small animals. Tourists visit these wildlife areas for hunting, photographing and for leisure. Promotion of Kijashu rock art site for archaeo-tourism may attract more tourists in this area. The paintings are in fair state of preservation. Most of the painted human figures are still visible and identifiable making the site to have more archaeo-tourism attractions. The faded animals and some geometric figures require the use of image processing software for easy visualization. The paintings can be processed and the traced images can be mounted on a panel on the floor for tourists to see and compares. The decision to introduce archaeo-tourism should be practiced in great care so that the paintings are not damaged due to tourists’ activities. Educating local communities and tourists about the aesthetic, educational, scientific, and economic values including the irreplaceable nature of paintings can minimize the negative impacts (Mabulla 2005). An accompanying guide (s) should be able to give informative explanation on the art and protect it from vandalism. Also special pamphlets for this site and the art should be prepared and distributed to visitors and local communities. Information boards can also be made at the main office in the park but also promoting the site through Internet and Websites. More importantly, the local communities must enjoy the art and directly and/or indirectly benefit from it. The challenge is that the rock art site occurs in a wildlife-restricted area. This can be addressed by the Maswa GR management to include the local community in the management, conservation and display of Kijashu site for archaeo-tourism. By engaging the local community, the long-range survival and sustainability of
Kijashu rock paintings will be ensured.
6.3	Simiyu Rock Art in Relation to Rock Art from other Regions of LVB
This section discusses the relationships of rock art between Simiyu region to those of other regions within LVB. As reported earlier, this study documented four rock art sites in Simiyu, though only Kijashu rock painting site was subjected to detailed analysis and study. The rest were generally described so as go to give an overview of the paintings, their stylistics characteristics and tradition. The analysis and descriptions show that Simiyu rock paintings share similarities with paintings from other areas of LVB. Yet differences were also observed.
Like the majority of sites in Mwanza Gulf, Mara region and Muleba district in Kagera region, Kijashu rock art site also contain geometrical designs. The diversity of geometric designs from these regions are very similar in character dominated by simple geometric forms in which circles, concentric circles and concentric circles with externally radiating lines predominate. Also lines, rings, vertical “gridiron” patterns, circles surrounded by ordered lines of dots, semi-circles, dots, ladders, sets of parallel lines, crosses, rounded, quadrilateral figures and “H-like” designs are present (Chaplin 1974; Mabulla 2005). All the mentioned geometric designs are portrayed in red. Despite the fact that geometric designs are not predominant motifs at Kijashu, fundamentally, they were sequentially depicted into two phases. The first phase was the concentric circles and concentric circles with externally radiating lines executed in dusky red pigments. The geometric designs executed in orange were the last painting phase as seen before featured by circles with externally radiating line or “sun-like” designs, lines, circles with semi-circles inside, ovals, a geometric human-like figure and free form abstractions. Kijashu phases of geometric designs differ stylistically as well as their mode of execution. This suggests two different groups of hunter-forager painters.
The “stick” human figures dominate at Kijashu site. It is observed that in East Africa the elongated “stick” human figures are rare and when depicted only in low frequency (Coulson 2013). Unlike other sites within LVB, at Kijashu the attenuated “stick” human figures form 77% of all depicted images. At other sites in LVB the “stick” human figures are also painted, but not in significant abundance. While a scenic relationship of cooperation in humans such as dancing, singing, and walking is depicted at Kijashu site, humans in other regions of LVB
are painted adapting lacustrine environment for instance fishing. Also canoes and fishtails are depicted referring to lacustrine adaptations. In Mara, some of the human figures are painted holding their waists and others carrying objects on their heads (Mabulla 2005). These cases were not observed at Kijashu site.
Paintings of wild animals are extremely rare in Mwanza and Bukoba. Only two undisputed figures at Nyamkira in Mwanza Gulf were identified as giraffes (Chaplin 1974). In Mara, depictions of giraffes and zebras at Nyabiterangi rock shelter 2, Nyetasho rock shelter 2 and Chanyamsinja are the painted animals (Mabulla 2005). On the contrary, paintings of wild animals are numerous at Kijashu site. Giraffes dominate suggesting that the painters favoured them. The social, cultural and economical significances of these big game animals have been discussed earlier.
Ostriches are the only bird species depicted in the study area. Also, depictions of birds in other regions of LVB are very rare. Only a flying bird probably an eagle has been recorded at Nyamang’ora rock shelter 1 in Mara region.
As regards to superimposition, only sites in Mara and Simiyu regions can be meaningfully compared. While concentric circles and concentric circles with rays represent the first phase or episode of painting at Kijashu, in most sites of Mara region, these were painted in the second phase, although they overlay other geometric figures.
In LVB, rock art sites predominantly occur hilly and rocky areas similarly to central, northcentral and southern Tanzania. Exposed schists, granites and gneiss rocks of basement hills of Precambrian period formed shelters and overhang that prehistoric people used as habitation sites and canvases for painting. Yet, there are some good shelters and overhangs without traces of pictographs. The reason for this is unclear and was not the goal for this research.
In LVB as the rest part of Tanzania, most of the paintings occur in hidden sites that are difficult to access. Two observations can be made out of this. Firstly, the prehistoric painters chose sites that offered protection from enemies/invaders and dangerous wild animals. The choice could also have been means of protecting the art from being seen by everybody in the group. Thus shelters with good commanding views and difficult to access would be favoured. Secondly, sites may have been chosen for habitation purposes and later on painted. This is why many rock sites’ floors have artifact scatters on the surface and sometimes deep
archaeological deposits. The artifacts in shelters' floors indicate human occupations and activities.
6.4	Simiyu Rock Art in Relation to North-Central Tanzania Rock Art
Although the Kijashu rock art site is attributed to H-F, RG tradition but most of sites in northcentral Tanzania are predominately H-F, FFL. Most of the paintings in north-central Tanzania are painted on various shades of various red characterized by thin-lines executed by brushes. Naturalistic and semi-naturalistic wild animals and stylized humans mostly dominate the subject matters. Mammals such as kudu, gazelle, eland, impala, hartebeest, wildebeest, giraffes, elephants, rhinos, buffalos, and zebras are represented. Like in central and southern highlands, most of the painted animals are bovids. Scholars have agreed that most of the painted animals might have represented animals that supplied surplus meat or had deeper symbolic meaning (Leakey 1983; Itambu 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Such evidences show that the H-F FFL of north-central Tanzania share characteristics with the paintings from central and southern Tanzania.
The H-F, RG Art tradition of north-central Tanzania shares similar characteristics with the H-F RG Art tradition of Simiyu Region. Typical designs include circles, concentric circles, circles with externally radiating lines, semi-circles, dots, divided circles, ladders, lines, and sets of horizontal and vertical lines. With the exception of dots, ladders, divided circles, circles with radiating lines, sets of horizontal and vertical line the rest of the figures particularly, the concentric circles and concentric circles with externally radiating rays are also found at Kijashu site. In both regions, these figures were painted in fine line using brushes, but the dots were finger-painted.
The Bantu Language-Speaker Art tradition of north central Tanzania has close link to that that of Simiyu region, LVB. The subject matters, artistic style and colour types are similar. Both are crudely painted, dominated by geometric designs. The schematic depictions of anthropomorphic figures and stylized animals in this tradition have been reported only in north-central and other sites from southern Tanzania (Itambu 2013; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). The “Bantu Language-Speaker” Art in Simiyu region is found at Butimba site.
Gululu rock shelter is the only site with Maasai “Olpul” Art tradition. This rock art tradition also occurs in north-central Tanzania. It occurs at seven sites, three in the Serengeti National
Park and four sites in NCA (Mabulla and Gidna 2014). The subject matter from these sites are similar with those of Gululu rock shelter motifs although the common subject matters in all sites include humans, domesticated and wild animals, and tools and weapons such as spears and shields. Humped bulls are the only painted domestic animals in all the sites. Painted wild animals in Serengeti sites and NCA comprised of male lions, elephants, giraffes, eland and rhinoceros. Similar wild animals were painted at Gululu rock shelter. Common scenic relationships have also been noted in all sites. Humans are painted holding sticks and spears associated with wild and domestic animals. In one site in NCA human figures are painted with hands holding their waists. At Gululu site human figures were painted holding their hands together. At one site in the NCA, a human figure is painted holding a shield and spear fighting a charging male lion. Similar oppositional scenes were also observed at Gululu rock shelter. The geometric designs documented at one site in Serengeti and NCA respectively, were not documented at Gululu. Such geometric designs are now interpreted as cattle bells (Audax Mabulla, pers. Comm., 2014). The occurrence of such geometric designs in Serengeti and NCA sites and not at Gululu is the only difference characterizing the Maasai “Olpul” Art. These paintings are mostly executed in monochrome black, monochrome red, biochrome red and white, biochrome red and black, polychrome red, black and white, as well as polychrome red, orange, black and white colours. The preference and consistency in motifs, style, scenic relationships, association of figures and colours from suggest that these paintings were the works of the same groups of people with the same culture and life styles. When documenting Gululu site, game rangers reported to have seen another site with similar paintings. The research crew tried to locate this site but was unable due to restrictions to enter in Maswa GR for the second time. Future study will locate this site.
CHAPTER SEVEN CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.0 General Research Findings
The first objective of this research was to survey and document rock art sites in Simiyu region. The survey was conducted for about three weeks under financial, physical and logistic challenges. Nonetheless, the survey recorded and documented four rock art sites. These include Gululu, Butimba, Nyungu and Kijashu rock art sites.
The second objective of the research was to study, analyze, and identify the images depicted, styles and rock art tradition of the sites. Due to time constraints, only Kijashu site is was subjected to intensive analysis and discussion. Intensive analysis employed ImageJ, (DStretch Plugin), Photoshop C5 and Microsoft office excel 2011 softwares using a MacBook Pro Retina (2013) laptop computer. The analysis indicates that the site belongs to H-F, RG Art tradition. The subject matters include “stick” human figures, wild animals, birds and geometric designs. These are executed in thin line using brushes and in shades of dusky red, light red and orange colours. The human figures are painted in stylized form while the wild animals are painted in semi-naturalistic and stylized forms. Also, the birds are painted in semi-naturalistic and stylized forms, while the geometric designs are in abstract form. The Kijashu site paintings represent a single panel that may have been painted at different times. The study of paint superimpositions shows that Kijashu paintings were painted in four phases. The first phase is represented by concentric circles with externally radiating lines, 20 small human figures, the human family of three figures and few animals all in dusky red colour. Wild animals and birds, all in light-red colour, represent the second phase. The third phase is represented by the “stick” human figures overlying concentric circles and wild animals of first and second phases respectively. Geometric circles and a human figure, all in orange colour, represent the last phase. These paintings overly the concentric circles and “stick” human figures of first and third phases respectively.
The third objective was to evaluate the state of rock art sites and paintings and identify threats for their long-range survival. This study reveals three factors that threaten the long-range survival of the paintings. These include, firstly, physical agents such as weathering/exfoliation of rocks and pigments. Some of the paintings are exposed to sunlight, rainwater and wind, causing deterioration of the paintings. Secondly, biological agents such
as animal excretions, tree growths, termite mounds and bird and wasps nests also deteriorate the paintings. Lastly, are the anthropogenic agents. These include graffiti, scratching, pecking, and smoke/soot.
The last objective of the study was to assess the potentials of the rock art sites for archaeo-tourism. Of the four recorded and documented rock art sites, three of them have potential for public display and development of archaeo-tourism programmes. These are Gululu, Butimba and Kijashu rock art sites. These sites are easily accessible and their paintings are in good to very good state of preservations. Kijashu and Gululu rock art sites occur in the Maswa GR and if well promoted, they can attract many visitors. Nonetheless, before these sites are open for displays, management plans should first be put in place. This should go hand in hand with training of guides and site managers. Such training can be done at either certificate, diploma or degree levels at the University of Dar es Salaam, Department of Archaeology and Heritage Management. These guides and site managers will be able to guide, educate and control the tourists when visiting the sites. Also, they will have to involve the local communities in conservation and managing the rock art sites since they are the immediate stakeholders and caretakers of these heritage assets. In order to have meaningful partnerships with the communities in managing and conserving the rock art sites, the local communities should benefit from the generated revenue. This study has generated a wealth of information and new knowledge about the rock art of Simiyu region in general and Maswa GR in particular. If this information is properly used for archaeo-tourism, it will attract tourists and the public to visit the sites. Therefore, the archaeo-tourism sites will generate revenues that will improve the economy of the local people, region and country. Yet, some of the revenue should also be invested into managing the sites (Mabulla 2000).
Overall, Simiyu region contains of rock paintings of three major art traditions. These include the H-F, RG Art at Kijashu and Nyungu sites, Bantu Language Speaker Art at Butimba site and Maasai “Olpul” Art at Gululu. These rock art traditions resemble those from other regions of LVB, north-central, central and southern Tanzania. Such resemblances can be found in the subject matters, stylistic characterizations and the employed colours. Nonetheless, there are also minor regional variations as explained in this dissertation. This study hypothesizes that the painters of these prehistoric and historic paintings may have close cultural, social, and/or religious ties and similar cosmological understandings and beliefs
7.1	Final Remarks and Future Direction for research
Clearly, this study shows that Simiyu region has the potential to add to the existing body of knowledge about the rock art of LVB in particular, and Tanzania in general. The existing body of rock art knowledge in Tanzania is biased towards known areas with dense concentration of sites, such as central Tanzania. Most of these sites were reported and recorded very long time ago during pre- and post-colonial eras with limited recording and documentation techniques. Therefore, this study calls for survey and documentation projects of new and known areas with new recording and documentation techniques. For example, this study was carried in a rock art terra incognito region and with time and financial constraints. Yet, the research recovered and documented four sites. After knowing of what we were looking for, informants reported the existence of many rock art sites within the study area, but could not visit them due to logistic, time and financial constrains. Therefore this study recommends the following:
1)	Design and conduct more rock art surveys in the region with a goal of recovering and documenting new sites. This study was conducted on in Meatu district, yet pre-Cambrian rocks that formed suitable canvases for painters are widespread in Simiyu region;
2)	This study is a progressive work and hence it is not expected to conclude. Three sites have not been analyzed and discussed in details. Therefore, future research should aim to re-visit the sites, spending some times to study the sites and paintings and applying more precisely documentation methods, particularly, photographing;
3)	To analyze the paintings in details using the state of the art analytical techniques such as ImageJ (DStretch Plugin), Photoshop, Autocad and ASRix techniques to trace the paintings and identify overlays. This is crucial because with the exception of this study, previous researchers have used none of these techniques. Therefore, there are need to employ such techniques to all rock paintings of Tanzania including those of central, north-central, southern and LVB regions;
4)	To excavate and study the cultural material remains and establish relative cultural chronology of rock art sites in Simiyu region;
5)	In Tanzania, absolute dating of pigments has not yet been conducted. This means that the given dates of rock paintings are based on association with other absolutely dated archaeological materials and climatic association as described earlier. Thus dating is not consistency. Future researches in Tanzania should desire to collect pigment samples and date the pigments directly (Gomes et al., 2013). This endeavor will yield absolute dates for the paintings of Tanzania and clarify the existing dilemma. At present, some authorities argue that the oldest HF, FFL of Tanzania date to 60,000-40,000 years old (Anati 1986; Mabulla and Gidna 2014). Others argue that the oldest paintings of Tanzania are only 10,000 years ago (Masao 1979; Coulson and Campbell 2000); and
6)	Design and implement rock art projects with management, conservation, education and archaeo-tourism goals that integrate communities around rock art sites. This approach will involve promoting rock sites for public displays and generate revenues for the local, regional and country’s economies. The generated rock art revenues should also benefit the local communities who are the immediate caretakers and beneficiaries. In this way, the long-range survival of rock art will be ensured (Leakey 1983; Mabulla 2000, Bwasiri 2008, Mabulla and Gidna 2014).
