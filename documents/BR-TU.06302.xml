Resumo
O objetivo deste trabalho é investigar como os processos relacionados à subducção no noroeste da América do Sul deformam e alteram a composição da placa superior, assim como a relação entre fluidos crustais e vulcanismo ativo/inativo. Para esse fim, este estudo desenvolveu: (1) Correlações cruzadas de ruído sísmico ambiente para os componentes vertical, radial e transversal entre todos os possíveis pares de estações permanentes implantadas pelo Serviço Geológico da Colômbia entre 2012 e 2016, que foram usadas para reconstruir as funções empíricas de Green para ondas Rayleigh e Love na região; (2) Novas medições de velocidade de ondas supeficiais de grupo para ondas Rayleigh e Love a partir de fontes de terremotos regionais e distantes; (3) Novos Mapas de ondas de superfície de fase e grupo entre 7 e 150 s para as ondas Love e Rayleigh, a partir de tomografia de ruído ambiente e ondas de superfície; (4) Novos mapas de velocidad das ondas e para a crosta e manto superior (até 140 km); e, (5) Um modelo 3D de anisotropia radial do noroeste da América do Sul. Os modelos de velocidade da onda S e de anisotropia radial para a crosta e manto superior para o noroeste da América do Sul foram desenvolvidos a partir de 1.300 funções de Green empíricas a partir de correlações cruzadas de ruído ambiente, e de 11.000 percursos de ondas de superfície de fontes de terremotos. As curvas de dispersão de fase e grupo para as ondas Rayleigh e Love foram medidas no intervalo de 7 a 150 s no conjunto de dados total, e invertidas tomografica-mente para produzir mapas de fase e de grupo para ondas Rayleigh e Love numa grade de 0.5° x 0.5° para tomografia de ruido sismico e de 1.0° x 1.0° para tomografía de on-
das de superficie. Perfis de velocidade para Vsv e VSH en função da profundidade foram construídos a partir da inversão conjunta das curvas de dispersão de grupo e fase em cada nó da grade da tomográfica até 140 km de profundidade.
Os modelos de velocidade revelam zonas de baixa velocidade a 25-35 km de profundidade sob regiões de vulcanismo ativo e inativo, sugerindo a presença de magmas que levam a assinatura da subducção segmentada na placa superior. As regiões de baixa velocidade crustal exibem anisotropia radial negativa (VSH&amp;lt;Vsv) sob vulcões ativos, sugerindo a presença de diques magmáticos subverticais alimentando o volcanismo, enquanto anisotropia radial positiva (VSH&gt; Vsv) sob regiões vulcânicas inativas é consistente com o armazenamento de magma em soleiras. A 40 km de profundidade, velocidades baixas sob as cordilheiras Central e Oriental exibem anisotropia radial positiva (até 15%), que é interpretado como armazenamento de magmas relacionados à subducção na crosta inferior. Baixas velocidades da onda S com anisotropia radial positiva são observadas na Bacia Inferior do Magdalena em todos os níveis crustais, o que é consistente com velocidades altas e baixas alternadas dentro do pacote sedimentar, tensões extensionais, cisalhamento sub-horizontal e/ou magmas sub-litosféricos que atravessaram uma placa caribenha fraturada. Em níveis crustais superiores a médios, anisotropia radial negativa e altas velocidades coincidem com os principais terrenos tectónicos (Maciço de Santa Marta, Batólito de Antioquia, Maciço de Santander, Batólito de Ibagué), enquanto a anisotropia positiva e as velocidades baixas caracterizam as principais bacias costeiras (por exemplo, Bacia Inferior do Magdalena, Bacia de Tumaco). Em terrenos tectónicos, a anisotropia negativa pode ser explicada através de tectónica de escape, enquanto a anisotropia positiva sob as bacias costeiras pode ser resultante de uma combinação de soleiras, tectónica extensional e/ou cisalhamento sub-horizontal.

Abstract
The objective of this work is to investigate how subduction-related processes in NW South America deform and alter the composition of the overriding plate, as well as the relationship between crustal fluids and active/inactive volcanism. To that end, this study developed: (1) Vertical, radial and transverse ambient seismic noise cross-correlations between all possible pairs of permanent stations deployed by the Colombian Geological Survey between 2012 to 2016, to reconstruct empirical Green’s functions for inter-station Rayleigh and Love waves in the region; (2) New surface-wave group-velocity measurements for Rayleigh and Love waves from regional and teleseismic earthquake sources; (3) Surface-wave dispersion maps of phase and group velocity variation between 7 and 150 s for Love and Rayleigh waves; (4) New maps of and velocity at crustal and upper mantle depths (down to 140 km); and, (5) a 3D model of radial anisotropy for NW South America. S-wave velocity and radial anisotropy for the crust and upper mantle under NW South America have been developed from 1,300 empirical Green’s functions from ambient noise cross-correlations and from 11,000 fundamental-mode, surface-wave trains from earthquake sources. Phase- and group-velocity curves for Rayleigh and Love waves were measured in the 7-150 s period range from the combined dataset, and tomographically inverted to produce maps of phase- and group-velocity variation in a 0.5° x 0.5° grid for ambient noise and 1.0° x 1.0° for surface waves. and velocity-depth profiles were constructed from the joint inversion of local group and phase dispersion curves at each node in the tomographic grid down to 140 km depth.
The S-velocity models reveal zones of slow velocity at 25-35 km depth under regions of both active and inactive volcanism, suggesting the presence of melts that carry the signature of segmented subduction into the overriding plate. The regions of slow crustal S-velocity display negative radial anisotropy (VSH &amp;lt;VSV) under active volcanoes, suggesting the presence of sub-vertical magmatic dykes feeding the volcanics, and positive radial anisotropy (VSH &gt; VSV) under inactive volcanic regions, consistent with magma storage along flat-lying sills. At 40 km depth, slow velocities under the Central and Eastern cordilleras display positive radial anisotropy (up to 15%), which is interpreted as storage of subduction-related magmas in the lower crust. Slow S-velocities with positive radial anisotropy are observed in the Lower Magdalena Basin at all crustal levels, consistent with a combination of alternating fast and slow velocities within the sedimentary package, extensional stresses, sub-horizontal shear, and/or sub-lithospheric melts from a fractured Caribbean flat slab. Negative radial anisotropy is also observed under Lower Magdalena Basin at upper mantle levels, coinciding with the location of the Caribbean flat slab. At upper to mid crustal levels negative radial anisotropy and high velocities coincide with major tectonic terrains (Santa Marta Massif, Antioquia Batholith, Santander Massif, Ibague Batholith), while that positive anisotropy and slow velocities characterizes major coastal basins (e.g., Lower Magdalena Basin, Tumaco Basin). In tectonic terrains, negative anisotropy may be explained through escape tectonics, while positive anisotropy under the coastal basins could be resulting from a combination of flay-lying magmatic sills, extensional tectonics, and/or sub-horizontal shear.

Introduction
Subduction is an important tectonic process that plays a major role in the dynamics of the Earth. The sinking of cold oceanic lithosphere into the mantle is associated with extensive recycling of hydrated materials (sediments, hydrated oceanic crust and upper mantle) and the growth of continents (e.g. (Condie 2005)). In addition, subduction zones are sites that are usually related to natural hazards such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, and tsunamis (Turcotte &amp;amp; Schubert 2002). The study of subduction-related processes can also address questions related to the nature of the plate-driving forces, and the mechanism of deformation in the upper plate and its magmatic overprint.
Seismological observations have traditionally provided valuable information about the nature of the crust and underlying mantle (Romanowicz 1991, Rawlinson et al. 2010). They have also been the main tool for exploring the structure of subduction zones at great depths and related processes. In particular, crustal thickness variations, bulk elastic properties, Vp/Vs ratio and P- and S-wave velocity variations and seismic anisotropy have provided important information of tectonic and geological processes all around the planet. For this reason seismologists have dedicated significant time and effort to knowing the internal structure of the Earth.
One of the most important seismological tools to map the structure of the Earth has
been seismic tomography and, perhaps to a lesser extent, seismic anisotropy. In the last decade, improvements in measuring surface-wave dispersion from earthquake-generated surface waves and empirical Green‘s functions (EGFs) extracted from ambient noise cross-correlations have allowed the crust and lithospheric mantle to be imaged in unprecedented detail. Surface-wave tomography (SWT) has been successfully utilized to image the continental lithosphere at several scales (Feng et al. 2004, Ritsema et al. 2004, Rosa et al. 2016). Tomographic images from naturally-occurring surface-waves, however, rarely provide information at periods shorter than 20 s, which are required to image the upper and middle crust. Fortunately, the cross-correlation of continuous recordings of ambient seismic noise for pairs of stations has recently been shown to be a powerful method for surface-wave imaging at local-to-regional scales (Sabra et al. 2005, Snieder 2004, Bensen et al. 2008, Lin et al. 2008a, Villasenor et al. 2007). Since both ANT and SWT methods are, in principle, sensitive to the same bulk properties of the solid Earth, combining the two methods to produce measurements in a broad band of frequencies has become an important tool for investigating lithospheric structure as a whole.
In addition, the study of seismic anisotropy allows to learn about the deformation history of the crust and upper mantle, their magmatism, and flow patterns resulting from tectonic processes. In the recent years. it has become popular to investigate the patterns of deformation in the crust through radial anisotropy (Becker et al. 2008). Traditionally, seismic anisotropy studies had utilized SKS phases from distant earthquake sources (Porritt et al. 2014, Bastow et al. 2015, Idarraga-Garcia et al. 2016, Becker et al. 2008), inferring the orientation of anisotropic fabrics in the lithosphere and/or flow patterns in the asthe-nospheric mantle; most recently, radial anisotropy has been considered for inferring patterns of fluid flow and/or direction of ductile deformation in the crust through the VsV and Vsh discrepancy in Rayleigh and Love waves (Das &amp;amp; Rai 2017, Lynner et al. 2018, Spica et al. 2017, Yudistira et al. 2017).
The recent deployment of seismic stations by the Colombian Geological Survey in
the Colombian Andes, and the availability of seismological data from other international networks has allowed the application of several methods to improve our knowledge of the lithospheric structure under northwestern South America (van der Hilst &amp;amp; Mann 1994, Ta-boada et al. 2000, Corredor 2003, Gutscher et al. 2000, Vargas &amp;amp; Mann 2013, Idárraga-García et al. 2016, Syracuse et al. 2016). Those studies have demonstrated that the geometry of the Nazca and Caribbean plates at depth is complex, as evidenced by the presence of two Wadati Benioff zones displaced ~250 km from each other at about ~5.5°N. However, few studies have focused on the structure of the overriding South American plate and the relationships to subduction-related processes. Refraction surveys, for instance, were performed in southern Colombia as part of the Nariño Project (Aldrich et al. 1973, Ocola et al. 1975, Meissnar et al. 1976, Meyer et al. 1976, Mooney et al. 1979), producing a crustal cross-section for the region; and a 1D velocity model for the Colombian crust was developed by Ojeda and Havskov (2001), seeking to improve accuracy in the location of crustal seismicity. On a more regional scale, crustal thickness was surveyed by Poveda et al. (2015), based on receiver functions analysis and a published compilation of crustal thickness observations; and images of lateral P- and S-wave velocity variation between
12.5	and 155 km depth were developed by Syracuse et al. (2016), but interpretations focused on the deep structure. A regional-scale investigation of lateral seismic velocity variation of the overriding South American plate is thus still missing.
The present configuration of the northwestern corner of South America is the result of the interaction between two major oceanic plates (Nazca, Caribbean), and three continental blocks (Northern Andes, Panamá and Maracaibo). The crustal rocks in this corner of the continent keep a record of the amalgamation and disassembly of western Pangaea, pieces of South America rifted away from North America (Spikings et al. 2015). More recently, the collision of the Caribbean province created new crust that was added to the Atlantic margin during Early and Late Cretaceous times (Escalona &amp;amp; Mann 2011), and the subsequent collision of the Panamá arc in western Colombia during Middle Miocene
times (Restrepo &amp;amp; Toussaint 1988, Taboada et al. 2000, Cediel et al. 2003) completed the present make-up of NW South America. These terrains were later reworked and altered by convergence-related processes. The composition of the South America upper plate is presently being deformed by subduction-related volcanism, which reaches as far north as ~5.5°N latitude. Volcanism is active along the Central Cordillera and inactive along the Eastern Cordillera, and is offset at ~5.5°N latitude by ~250 km in the EW direction, following the pattern delineated by intermediate, subduction-related seismicity (Wagner et al. 2017, Pennington 1981).
The NW corner of South America thus constitutes a unique tectonic setting to investigate how subduction-related processes deform and alter the overriding plate, and the relationship between crustal fluids and active/inactive volcanism. Currently, there are no investigations connecting how subduction systems alter and deform the upper plate.
In this study, vertical, radial and transverse ambient seismic noise cross-correlations between all possible pairs of permanent stations deployed by the Colombian Geological Survey between 2012 to 2016 in NW South America were computed to extract empirical Green’s functions for inter-station Rayleigh and Love waves in the region, and develop maps of phase and group velocity variation between 7 and 38 s. The resulting ambient noise tomography (ANT) maps were then combined to map radial anisotropy with depth through the Love-Rayleigh wave discrepancy (Lynner et al. 2018, Moschetti et al. 2010a, Spica et al. 2017). Moreover, group-velocity maps in the 40 to 150 s period range were also constructed through surface wave tomography (SWT) of Love and Rayleigh waves from regional and teleseismic sources, and combined with the shorter-period ANT results to develop joint VSV and VSH velocity models at crustal and upper mantle depths (down to 140 km).
Shear velocities show an excellent correlation with surface geology at shallow depths, and reveal low-velocity patterns at mid-crustal depths (25-35 km) that correlate with active and inactive surface volcanism in the central portion of the Eastern Cordillera and the
southern flank of the Central Cordillera, respectively. These low-velocity anomalies are interpreted as magmas derived from the mantle wedge above the Nazca and Caribbean plates. More strikingly, a similar low-velocity anomaly is also observed under the Lower Magdalena Basin, where flat subduction of the Caribbean plate has prevented the occurrence of surface volcanism. We argue that this low-velocity region represents either the signature of fluid expulsion near crustal faults or upwelling magmas from the underlying asthenosphere, which would have breached the flat-subducting Caribbean plate through a preexisting fracture and pond at mid-crustal levels within the overriding plate.
Radial anisotropy reveals positive anisotropy for the upper crust where the principal sedimentary basins (e.g. LMB, TB, EC) are located, coinciding with sub-horizontal layering of Quaternary sedimentary sequences, while negative anisotropy overlaps with active volcanism (CC) and igneous-metamorphic (SMM, SM) terrains. In the middle crust, negative anisotropy regions are found under active volcanic complexes, consistent with storage along sub-vertical magmatic dykes; in contrast, positive radial anisotropy is observed under inactive volcanism along the EC, suggesting storage along flat-lying sills. In the upper mantle negative radial anisotropy under the LMB is found consistent with the proposed extent of Caribbean flat subduction.
This thesis contains six chapters. In Chapter 1 (this chapter), I present the motivation of this research and outline the main results of my investigations. In chapter 2 the Colombian geological and tectonic framework is described. Chapter 3 is dedicated to describing the techniques and methods used in this research. In Chapter 4, published as Poveda et al. (2018), I present the first ambient noise tomography of the Colombian Andes and surrounding regions, and provide a 3-D shear velocity model for the upper and middle crust. In Chapter 5, I determine lateral variations in radial anisotropy from ambient noise and surface wave tomography, and analize the relationship between crustal fluids and ac-tive/inactive volcanism under the Colombian Andes. In Chapters 6 and 7, the discussion and concluding remarks are presented, final considerations on the results obtained.
Chapter 2
Geology and Tectonic setting
Northwestern South America corresponds to the area in which the Colombian Territory is located, being limited to the north and west by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, respectively. The northern Andes extend through Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela; in Colombia, they are structured into three main ranges (Eastern, Central and Western Cordilleras) and two intervening valleys (Middle Magdalena Valley, and Cauca-Patia Valley), where the Magdalena and Cauca rivers are respectively located. The Eastern Llanos, an extensive zone with flat and slightly undulating topography located eastwards, is part of the South American shield that extends further toward the Brazilian plains. The Macarena range, a small and isolated range from the Andean Cordillera is found within the western half of the Eastern Llanos. The Caribbean region is a flat area that encompasses a pyramidal structure (Santa Marta Massif) to the north, and where the Magdalena and Cauca rivers come together to flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The presence of a small mountain range (Baudo range) in the western most portion of Colombia, parallel to the Pacific coast, completes the physiographic landscape of the region.
The Northwestern region (Figure 2.1) has undergone significant tectonic deformation over geological time, which resulted from the interaction among three tectonic plates (South American, Nazca and Caribbean), and a number of tectonic blocks (Panama arc,
North Andean and Maracaibo). The Nazca plate is moving east with respect to the South American continental plate at ~5 cm/year (Trenkamp et al. 2002) with a variable angle of subduction between 30° and 40° beneath the NAB, the convergence being accommodated along of Pacific subduction zone, and numerous fault systems along the Andean belts and intervening valleys. Pacific subduction is manifested through active seismicity throughout the region and volcanism in the Central Cordillera between Peru and latitude 5.5°N within Colombia. The Panama arc (also know as Panama-Chocó Block) behaves as a rigid indenter that is in collision with the NAB. As a result, the Panamá arc is under compression and has an ENE movement with respect to the remaining South American continent, indicative of an escape caused by indentation (Freymueller et al. 1993, Trenkamp et al. 2002). The Caribbean plate, on the other hand, is converging at 1-2 mm/yr ESE with respect to South America. Several authors proposed that the Caribbean Plate subducts beneath the North Andean Block at a shallower dip (Mora-Bohórquez et al. 2017, Vargas &amp;amp; Mann 2013, Yarce et al. 2014) without subducted-related volcanism, being responsible for extensional deformation in the Lower Magdalena Basin. Seismicity in this area is reduced with respect to the Pacific region, and active volcanims is absent. The Caribbean plate and NAB interaction place the triangularly-shaped Santa Marta Massif under compression. It has been proposed that this portion of the NAB is a separate tectonic block that accommodates deformation in the area. This postulated block - known as the Maracaibo Block (MaB) - would thus be being expulsed north eastwards with respect to South America as a result of plate convergence (Taboada et al. 2000).
The northern Andes and the Caribbean region behave as a coherent tectonic unit known as the North Andean Block (NAB), which can thus be regarded as a collage of several terrains that accreted against the Guyana Shield at different stages through Earth’s history (Restrepo &amp;amp; Toussaint 1988, Cediel et al. 2003). The latest addition to the NAB was the Panamá arc, which includes the Baudó Range, and represents an oceanic arc covered by oceanic sediments (Case et al. 1971, Restrepo &amp;amp; Toussaint 1988, Taboada
et al. 2000, Cediel et al. 2003). The Panamá arc is thus seen as an exotic terrain within the NAB (Duque-Caro 1990, Taboada et al. 2000).
2.1	Geology
The geology of each of the Colombian cordilleras is varied, reflecting the diverse histories of subduction, collision, accretion and uplift that has characterized the western margin of Colombia through the geological ages (Restrepo &amp;amp; Toussaint 1988, Spikings et al. 2015, Cediel et al. 2003). To the west, the Baudo range represents an oceanic, basic and ultramafic magmatic arc covered by oceanic sediments (Case et al. 1971, Restrepo &amp;amp; Toussaint 1988, Taboada et al. 2000). The Western Cordillera is composed by a sequence of allochthonous accreted oceanic mafic and ultra mafic terrains of MORB composition, accreted during Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic times (Weber et al. 2015). The proposed tectonic scenario that gives rise to the geology of the western cordillera and neighboring areas is due to the oblique subduction of the Caribbean Oceanic plateau under South America (Figure 2.2), during the Upper Cretaceous to the Eocene (Pindell &amp;amp; Kennan 2009, Spikings et al. 2015, Weber et al. 2015). Subduction gave rise to an oceanic and continental plutonic arc (Weber et al. 2015).
The Central Cordillera is made of Paleozoic metamorphic rocks with intrusions of Mesozoic and Tertiary plutons of continental affinity, with deposit of Tertiary to Quaternary volcanic and volcano-sedimentary sequences (Bustamante et al. 2016, Restrepo-Moreno et al. 2009). The history of the Central Cordillera maintains a records of the fragmentation of Pangea that ocurred in the lower Triassic (240 ma). This area remained passive until 209 Ma within Pangaea, where a magmatic arc related to the oblique subduction of the Pacific plate (Farallon plate) between early Jurassic to early Cretaceous was originated, accompanied by extensional and retro-arc settings (Figure 2.3) generated by a roll-back of the plate (Spikings et al. 2015, Bustamante et al. 2016). The intense magmatism in the
Jurassic is represented mainly in the Ibague and Segovia (located in the San Lucas range
- SLR) batholiths in the Central Cordillera.

The Eastern Cordillera is covered by sequences of continental and marine sediments of several ages and contains Precambrian basement rocks with meta-sedimentary supra-crustals of Lower Paleozoic age and oceanic affinity (Gomez et al. 2007). The Eastern Cordillera has been interpreted as a wide Mesozoic extensional basin that was subsequently inverted by Andean compression and orogeny (Dengo &amp;amp; Covey 1993, Egbue et al. 2014). Next to the Eastern Cordillera are the Eastern LLanos, an extensive foreland basin associated to the Andean Orogen that overlays the Guyana craton with Lower Paleozoic and Tertiary sediments (Farris et al. 2011).

The main inter mountain valleys of NW South America include the Cauca-Patia Valley, which divides the Western Cordillera from the Central Cordillera and is made of volcanic and sedimentary rocks of oceanic and continental affinity, and the Middle Magda
lena Valley, which intervenes between the Central and the Eastern Cordillera and is covered by sequences of continental and marine sediments of several ages (Gomez et al. 2007).
The Caribbean region can be geologically described as an Oligocene-to-Recent forearc basin - the Lower Magdalena Basin (LMB) - overlying the shallowly dipping Caribbean slab (Bernal-Olaya et al. 2015, Mora-Bohorquez et al. 2017). The LMB is in turn composed of several subduction-related basins, such as the Plato, San Jorge, and Sinu-San Jacinto basins, and is bounded to the West by Sinu-San Jacinto fold-and-thrust belt. The Plato and San Jorge basins consist of Paleogene sediments overlying Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks, while the Sinu-San Jacinto fold-and-thrust belt is regarded as an accretionary wedge that includes rocks of Cretaceous age as well as Tertiary and Quaternary lacustrine sediments. The sedimentary prism making the Sinu-San Jacinto basin extends offshore along the margin of the northern South American Plate, with thicknesses of up to 10 km (Toto &amp;amp; Kellogg 1992, Flinch 2003, Montes et al. 2010, Lara et al. 2013). In the northernmost corner of the northern Andes outcrops the Santa Marta Massif, which includes Jurassic volcanics and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, along with volcano-sedimentary Cretaceous materials (Cardona et al. 2011).

2.2	Tectonic Setting
Several studies have been conducted in order to investigate the precise contact geometry between the Nazca and Caribbean plates, although this still remains a matter of debate. An initial model was proposed by (Pennington 1981). Through selection of hypocentral locations of earthquakes and focal mechanisms in the region, two distinct segments of subducted lithosphere were identified beneath the Colombian Andes: the Bucaramanga segment, related to subduction of the Caribbean Plate; and the Cauca segment, related to subduction of the Nazca Plate. This implied the existence of a slab tear at depth separating the postulated segments. The Bucaramanga segment would be subducting in the N109°E direction and dipping at 20°-25°, while the Cauca segment would be subducting in the N35°E direction with a 35° dip. Taboada et al. (2000), from seismological data, and seismic tomography among other observations, suggests an overlapping zone between 5.2°N and 7°N between the Nazca Plate and the Paleo Caribbean Plateu (thus called by the authors). This interaction produced a major E-W transpressive shear zone at 5.5°N, where the Bucaramanga seismic nest is located, associated with the Paleo-Caribbean Slab. This hypothesis is adopted by Cortes and Angelier (2003), based on a study of focal mechanisms.
At the same time, from three-dimensional analysis of CMT solutions, Corredor (2003) argues that the limit between Caribbean and Nazca plates is around 10° N. Corredor (2003) proposes, at 5.5°N, a fault zone overlap associated with the termination of volcanism. More recently, Vargas and Mann (2013), from relocated hypocenters, coda-Q tomography and regional magnetic and gravity data, propose that the Caribbean and Nazca plates are separated by a 240 km EW trending slab tear at 5°N latitude - the Caldas tear - separating subduction in the Caribbean and Nazca slabs. Recent tomographic images by Chiarabba et al. (2016) place the tear entirely within the Nazca plate, pushing the boundary of this plate north and implying an EW trending slab torn separating a steeply subducting
segment to the south from a flat subducting segment to the north. The latter is taken into account by Syracuse et al. (2016), from hypocentral relocations, joint inversion of local body wave arrivals, surface-wave dispersion measurements, and gravity data, propose that the region at 5.5°N is a non-overlaping slab tear of the Nazca plate, where intermediatedepth seismicity is shifted 200 km toward the East, beneath the Eastern Cordillera. Within the Nazca flat-slab, north of the slab tear, slab colission at 7.5°N, marks the location of the Bucaramanga seismic nest. This last study is in agreement with Wagner et al. (2017), which is based on observations of seismicity and ages of volcanoes.
In figures 2.5 and2.4 the Taboada et al. (2000) and Syracuse et al. (2016) models are displayed for comparison. Some differences can be observed in the interpretation of the northern limit of the Nazca plate, and the location and origin of the seismicity of the Bucaramanga nest. The two models agree that the Caribbean Plate presents flat subduction, as in most models do.

2.3	Seismicity
Figure 2.6 displays observed seismicity in NW South America (2011-2015) relocated
by Syracuse et al. (2017). The seismicity shows patterns that are related to the main faults
Figure 2.5: 3D schematic of the plate geometry proposed in Taboada et al. (2000)
and tectonic structures: (i) in the center and eastern border of the Eastern Cordillera, between 2°N to 4°N, seismicity concentrates between 0 and 30 km depth; (ii) offshore the Pacific Ocean relatively shallow earthquakes (&lt;60 km) show variations from north to south related to the subducted oceanic crust of the Nazca plate; (iii) intermediate and shallow seismicity is observed in the Darien range in Panamá, which is explained by the interaction of the Chocó-Pánama Block with South America; (iv) finally, there is a concentration of shallow earthquakes along the Salinas fault system, at the middle and Upper Magdalena Valley, which extends to the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga fault.
With the recent expansion of the Red Sismológica Nacional de Colombia (RSNC), a greater number of seismic events have been identified and located in the northern part of Colombia, throughout the Lower Magdalena Valley (LMB) and the Sinú-San Jacinto folded belts. However, the seismicity under the LMB continues to be diffuse, which can be explained by the low rate of convergence between the Caribbean and South American plates (Trenkamp et al. 2002). Also, a mixture of seismicity between 10 and 50 km is observed over the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.
Figure 2.6: Seismicity recorded between 2011-2015, relocated at Syracuse et al. 2016
Regarding intermediate-depth seismicity (60 - 200 km), two patterns are observed associated to the subduction systems in the region. Between 2°N and 5.5°N, under the CC and the CV, seismicity is linked to the subduction of the Nazca plate (Pennington 1981, Taboada et al. 2000, Vargas &amp;amp; Mann 2013). Intermediate seismicity in this area has been interpreted recently as a region with high volumes of dehydrated fluids (Chang et al. 2017). North of 5.5°N and until 11°N, to the east, under the LMB and the EC, there is a second region with intermediate seismicity overlapping with that of the Bucaramanga nest (Zarifi et al. 2007, Prieto et al. 2012), probably associated with Caribbean plate subduction ((Vargas &amp;amp; Mann 2013, Taboada et al. 2000)). North of 5.5N, the seismicity between 2°N-5.5°N seems to be displaced to the east, generating an offset in intermediate-depth seismicity. Recent studies, (Syracuse et al. 2016, Wagner et al. 2017) have proposed that in this region there is a tear (“the Caldas Tear” Vargas and Mann, 2013) of the Nazca plate, extending towards the north and containing the seismicity of the Bucaramanga nest. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain wether the seismicity north of 5.5°N is related to the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate or an overlap of both (van der Hilst and Mann, 1994, Taboada et al., 2000; Cortés and Angelier, 2005, Vargas and Mann, 2013, Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015a, Chiarabba et al., 2016, Syracuse et al., 2016, Wagner et al., 2017). Finally, for deep seismicity (&gt; 200 km), some events have been recorded in the south of the country, along the border with Perú. These events are associated with the Wadati-Benioff zone of Nazca plate.
Interesting, a cluster of shallow events is observed between ~71°W and ~3.8°N. The reported sequence started in 2013 and continueed until 2014. This seismicity has been associated to anthropogenic sources and coincides with an increase in oil production in late 2013 (Gómez-Alba et al. 2016).
Chapter 3
Methods
In this chapter, I present the fundamentals of ambient seismic noise processing to obtain the Empirical Green’s function (EGFs) between two receivers. I also review processing techniques used for obtaining surface wave dispersion curves from cross-correlation of seismic ambient noise recordings, followed by inversion procedures to obtain surfacewave velocity maps. These maps were inverted for (from Rayleigh wave), (from Love wave), and the Voigt average and radial anisotropy. These procedures are reviewed, as well.
3.1	Ambient seismic noise
Ambient seismic noise is the ubiquitous signal captured in the seismometers in the absence of seismic events and explosions. In the past, ambient seismic noise was considered unusable, interferring with earthquake signals recorded by seismometers. In the last years, it has been realized that seismic ambient noise due to Earth’s surface continuous vibrations over a wide frequency range provides continuous sampling of the Earth’s interior at different scales. Ambient noise can provide coherent information for interdisciplinary studies of the Earth. In Seismology, ambient noise can be transformed into a deterministic
seismic responses.
Seismic noise can be induced by natural or anthropogenic sources, containing a wide spectrum of frequencies. The sources that generate noise have different origins, and are classified by their spectral content. The principal sources of ambient noise are generated by pressure fluctuations on the ocean’s bottom along the coastlines, interactions of ocean waves traveling in opposite directions, and atmospheric perturbations (Prieto 2012, Bromirski 2009). Microseismic noise can be classified as either primary (single frecuency) and secondary (double frecuency) (Bromirski 2009). Primary microseism propagates periods similar to those of ocean waves (10-20 s), which are generated by ocean gravity waves near the coast, while secondary microseism is generated by the nonlinear interaction between direct and reflected ocean waves at a period band of 5-10 s (Tanimoto 2007). Higher frequencies have a local origin, closer to the sensor, and their generation is usually related to anthropogenic activities (e.g., machinery, explosions, etc.). In the absence of anthropogenic sources and earthquakes, simple and double frequency microseismic noise are clearly observed. Figure 3.1 shows the probability density function for station Prado (PRA) located in the Eastern Cordillera; high probability occurs in a band between 1 and 10 s, where the sources of the microseismic noise dominate. Note how the ambient noise signal falls within the HNM and LNM standard noise curves of (McNamara 2004).
Micro-seismic peaks can be considered as constituted mainly by surface waves. Changes in the oceans’ levels as ocean waves propagate across them, produce pressure differences in the seabed that generate Rayleigh and Love surface waves. This occurs because the seismic noise is excited by shallow sources (Bromirski 2009). However, global body waves can be generated by storms over the oceans, propagating through the Earth’s mantle and reflecting at major interfaces (Prieto 2012). By utilizing the correlation of ambient noise recordings, the dispersive nature of the surface waves can be extracted and used to obtain the shear wave velocity at varying depths and scales.

3.2	Seismic imaging with ambient noise
The pioneering work of Aki (1957) showed that it is possible to obtain the phase velocity of the surface waves under a seismic array from ambient noise. The technique, known as the SPatial AutoCorrelation method (SPAC) (Aki 1957), makes use of the frequency wavenumber (f-k) filtering of (Capon 1973) to obtain the dispersion relation and investigate the shallow S-wave velocity structures from recordings of ambient noise. Later on, Claerbout (1968) proposed that the temporal average of this spatial correlation could be used to retrieve the very impulse response itself. Based on these ideas, Campillo and Paul (2003), Shapiro and Campillo (2004) and Shapiro et al. (2005), presented a tomographic model of the upper and middle crustal using the long-term correlations of ambient noise recordings between station pairs. The approach was supported by the assumption that the surface wave Green's function between two stations could be extracted from crosscorrelations of a diffusive wavefield (Weaver &amp;amp; Lobkis 2002) recorded simultaneously at several stations pairs. The empirical Green's functions are composed by the surface waves packets because the noise sources occur at shallow depths, with more energy in the
fundamental mode.
The emergence of the Green’s function from the cross-correlation of simultaneously recorded ambient noise records is based on the assumption of an homogeneous distribution of noise sources and the proportionality of the cross-correlation to the Green’s function (Weaver &amp;amp; Lobkis 2002, Snieder 2004). This is a complete Green’s function of the medium that is symmetric in time, including all reflections, propagation modes and scattering.
The cross-correlation C(t) is a quantitative measure of the similarity between two time series, f (t) and g(t). The cross-correlation is defined as
f (t )g(t + T)dt,	(3.1)
where t is time, and T is the lag time of g(t) with respect to f (t). The cross-correlation between seismic recordings of ambient noise generated by independent sources, is described as (Wapenaar et al. 2010):
C(t) = G(rB, rA, t) + G(rB, rA, -t) (p(rB, t) * p(rA, -t)),	(3.2)
where G(rB, ra, t) is the Green’s function between rA and rB, and p(r, t) is the wave-field function describing the noise at r and at time t. Thus, by cross-correlating traces of seismic noise recorded at two receivers on the surface, it is possible to build the wavefield as if there were a source in one of the receiver’s locations (Wapenaar et al. 2010). Accordingly, with seismic array deployments at the surface, noise can be cross-correlated for each sensor pair, as if each of them were a virtual source.
Green’s function retrieval from cross-correlations between stations pairs thus relies on some measure of similarity between continuous seismic signals from different noise sources recorded at each station. There are several methods for calculating this similarity, such as the correlation (Bensen et al. 2007) and coherency (Prieto et al. 2009) functions.
The most commonly used in ambient noise tomography is the correlation function.
3.3	Ambient noise data processing
3.3.1	Preprocessing, time and frequency-domain normalization
The processing of ambient seismic noise to retrieve the empirical Green’s function can be divided into three stages: 1) preprocessing, 2) cross correlation, and 3) stacking. The aim of the preprocessing stage is to decrease the influence of earthquake signals and instrumental irregularities from the time series prior to cross correlation, the ambient noise bandwidth. It begins with cutting the continuous recordings into non-overlapping, 1 day-long segments, which are then demeaned, detrended, and tapered. Instrumental responses are deconvolved from the daily time series, bandpass-filtered between 0.01 and 0.2 Hz, and decimated to 1 sample per second. Time- and frequency-domain normalization is then applied to remove the signature of seismic waveforms within the frequency band of interest. Time-domain normalization is implemented through 1 bit normalization, preserving the phase and neglecting amplitude variations within the time series (Bensen et al. 2007, Larose 2004); frequency-domain normalization or spectral whitening is implemented through normalization of spectral amplitudes to a unit value without altering the phase, effectively broadening the frequency band of the ambient noise recordings (e.g., Bensen et al. 2007). After time-frequency normalization is applied to all 1 day long segments, cross correlations are computed in the time domain for all station pairs for frequencies between 0.01 and 0.2 Hz. Figure 3.2 illustrates the preprocessing steps for the San Jacinto station located in the Lower Magdalena Basin (LMB).
After preprocessing, the horizontal components (N, E) must be rotated into the greatcircle-path according to inter-station orientations, in order to produce the radial (R) and transverse (T) components. The pre-processed traces are finally cross-correlated in the time domain to develop vertical-vertical (ZZ) and radial-radial (RR) cross-correlations,
related to Rayleigh wave energy, and transverse-transverse (TT) cross-correlations, asso-
ciated to Love wave energy (see figure 3.4).
3.3.2	Cross-correlations and stacking
The next stage in the data processing consists of obtaining the daily cross-correlations for all possible station pairs. To that purpose, it was used the geometrical normalized cross-correlation (CCGN). This method is insensitive to amplitude changes between data sets, but is biased towards the large amplitude portions within the considered correlation windows (Schimmel 1999). It is defined as:
Cccgn (t) =
+ t)U2(t) ui(t + t)2	U2(T)2 ’
(3.3)
where u1 and u2 are the seismic noise recordings, and T, T and t are the lag time, the correlation window length and the time sample, respectively. Throughout this work, a T = 86400 s and lag-times of -1000 to 1000 s were used.
Individual cross-correlations are then stacked into average cross-correlation functions representing each Julian day to improve signal-to-noise ratio (Bensen et al., 2007). Stacking of the calculated ambient-noise cross-correlations was achieved through the timefrequency phase-weighted stack (tf-PWS) of (Schimmel et al. 2011). The tf-PWS is an improvement with respect to the original phase weighted stack (PWS) developed by (Schimmel &amp;amp; Paulssen 1997). The original PWS performed the stacking after weighting each sample of the linear stack with a measure of coherence independent of amplitude, as defined by the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal. The time domain PWS is expressed as

The final trace used for cross-correlation is shown in panel c). The 1 day-long time series was recorded on 21/12/2014. Note how the spurious signals (earthquakes) in the original waveform disappear after the pre-processing steps.
where N is the number of stacked traces, Sj is the j-th trace to be stacked, §(t) the instantaneous phase of the trace (Bracewell 1965), and v is the power intensity of the phase
weight.
The tf-PWS makes use of the S-transform (Stockwell et al. 1996) to obtain a time
frequency representation for each cross-correlogram, so that the stacking is controlled with frequency-dependent resolution while maintaining a close relationship between the time-averaging and the Fourier spectrum (Stockwell et al., 1996). The tf-PWS phase stack analogy with the PWS phase stack is defined as:
Cp.(T, f ) =
1 Sj(T, f ■ ' j MV)|
(3.5)
where Sj (t, f) is the S-transform of the j-th cross-correlogram and v is a value that adjusts coherent and less coherent signal stacking. The tf-PWS is obtained through the product of the phase stack cps(x, f) and the S-transform of the linear stack Sls(t, f) of the N-daily cross-correlations,

The cps(T, f) weights the coherent portions of the linear stack in the time-frequency domain (Schimmel et al. 2011). The time-frequency dependent phase coherence attenuates incoherent noise, because it allows for the determination of weak amplitude signals that are more phase-coherent than the background noise. Signals obtained with this method have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than those obtained with conventional methods (e.g. the classical correlation and stack method) (Bensen et al. 2007, Lin et al. 2008b, Villasenor et al. 2007, Yang et al. 2007). Figure 3.3 shows the Rayleigh wave cross-correlations with SNR greater than 20 computed with linear and tf-PWS. Note that, for this value of SNR, half of the cross correlations calculated with the linear stack are
lost.

3.4	Group and phase velocity estimation
3.4.1	Frequency Time ANalysis (FTAN) method
The empirical Green's functions from ambient noise cross-correlation are dominated by energy that is propagated as surface waves (Shapiro &amp;amp; Campillo 2004). Therefore, we can apply the time-frequency analysis (FTAN) of (Levshin &amp;amp; Ritzwoller 2001) to determine group velocity. This approach is constructed by applying a series of narrow bandpass filters to the signal, to then retrieve the group delay at each frequency by tracing the maximum of the signal envelope. The FTAN method also includes a phase-matched filter (Herrin &amp;amp; Goforth 1977) that cleans dispersion curves from multi-pathed signals.
One major advantage is that the procedure can be easily automated.
Dispersion measurements are obtained by considering the analytic signal in the frequency domain,
s(t )= f (t) + iH [. f ((I )]= A(t
(3.7)
where H[f (t)] is the Hilbert transform of f (t), A(t) is the envelope, and §(t) is the instantaneous phase. To build a frequency-time function, Gaussian filters are applied to the analytic signal,
z z _a( “ “n Gn(“) = e a(
)2
(3.8)

where “n is the central frequency and a is a tunable distance-dependent parameter that defines the width of the filter. The filtered analytical signal is then transformed back into the time domain through an inverse Fourier transform:
s(.“ni t) =
Gn(“)S(“)eiatd “,
(3.9)
where S(“) is the Fourier transform of s(t), defined as S(“)	s(t)eimtdt.
Group velocity is taken from the 2D envelope function |A(t, “n)|. In particular, the group delay time, t (“n), is determined from the envelope peak, so that group velocity is calculated as
U (“0 = r/t (“0)),	(3.10)
where r is the distance between stations. Group velocity estimation is improved if the instantaneous frequency “ = |d§(t, “0/dt) |t=t(ffl0) is used instead of the central frequency
(Bensen et al. 2007).
Phase velocity, on the other hand, is measured using the method outlined in (Lin et al. 2008a), by which the phase velocity 9 at a given period can be calculated from the equation
9
n n
= kr + rot + X + 2nN +------1—,
2	4
(3.11)
where k is the wave number, r is the interstation distance, ro is the instantaneous frequency, t is the observed group-delay time, X is the source phase or initial phase, and 2nN represents the phase ambiguity (with N = 0, ±1, ±2,...,). The additional n/2 phase represents the phase shift from the negative time derivative, and the n/4 phase arises from interference of the non-stationary terms in a homogeneous noise source distribution (Lin et al. 2008a, Snieder 2004). The phase ambiguity 2nN is assessed by comparing the long-period phase velocity measurements to a reference curve, which is based on the preliminary Earth model of (Dziewonski &amp;amp; Anderson 1981). A detailed example of FTAN
processing is displayed in figure 3.5.

3.4.2	Multiple Filter Analysis (MFA)
To develop dispersion measurements from earthquakes sources, the instrumental response was first removed from the recorded waveforms, which were then converted to displacement, demeaned, detrended and re-sampled to one sample per second. The best way to assess the effect of noise in a signal is to look at the seismograms over a range of frequencies. Thus, plotting the observations for a range of frequency bands is a good first step for finding reliable dispersion curves. An example is shown in figure 3.6.

The panel in the upper left is unfiltered and the title in that panel lists the distance (r) and the azimuth of the seismometer. The other three panels show the results of band-pass filtering the seismograms using a four-pole, two-pass Butterworth filter for different period ranges. The corner periods of the filters are shown above each panel. The data units are counts, which for most sensors indicates that a velocity seismogram is shown.

Time (s)
Dispersion was measured through the Multiple Filter Analysis (MFA) of (Dziewonski et al. 1969), as implemented in the PGSWMFA package (PGplot Surface Wave Multiple Filter Analysis) of Ammon, (1998), after isolating the fundamental mode through application of a phase-match filter (Herrin &amp;amp; Goforth 1977). Similarly to FTAN, the MFA approach uses a series of narrow bandpass Gaussian filters that isolate the wave trains around the central frequency of each filter. The group velocity for each frequency can then be determined by dividing the raypath length by the travel time of the maximum of the envelope. To obtain Love-wave measurements, we can apply the same filter to data rotated into the transverse direction. A detailed example of waveform processing for periods between 30 - 200 s, is shown in Figure 3.7.
3.5	Quality control and uncertainty estimation
3.5.1	Convergence analysis for EGFs and dispersion curves
One parameter to adjust in the computation of EGFs is the amount of data to be stacked in order to obtain reliable group-velocity measurements. To this purpose, waveform similarity was calculated for several trajectories through the zero-lag cross correlation between a reference trace (taken as the stacked cross-correlation of the maximum number of days available) and a subset of cross-correlations from the stack of a fixed number of days selected randomly at 30 days increment until matching the reference trace. Then, a plot of similarity versus number of random subset days was built and the minimum number of days after which the cross-correlation remains stable was chosen. Two examples are shown in figures 3.8 and 3.9 for two trajectories (HEL-ROSC and HEL-FLO2), with inter-station distances of 198 and 509 km, respectively. For HEL-ROSC, with a interstation path of 198 km, the convergence is very fast, with the minimum number of days at 150; for greater distances (&gt;500 km), at least 300 days are necessary for convergence. This process was repeated for even longer distances, finding that for distances greater than

The bottom-right panel displays the similarity as a function of random number days. Convergence is achieved in 300 days.
Also, in order to assess the performance of stacking methodologies (linear vs timefrequency phase weight-stack), convergence was assessed for several methodologies. It was observed that the time-frequency phase weight-stack reaches convergence with fewer days than the linear stack. This is illustrated in figure 3.10, for an interstation path of 217 km, for which convergence is reached with 100 days with the tf-PWS and 150 days with the linear stack.

Following Bensen et al. (2007), dispersion measurements from cross correlations with interstation distances less than three wavelengths and with SNR &amp;lt;7 were rejected. The SNR was calculated for periods between 5 to 40 s. In general, higher values of SNR were observed with tf-PWS procedure, since the tf-PWS allows to eliminate incoherent phases and increases the contribution of coherent, low-energy phases (Schimmel &amp;amp; Gallart 2007). Figure 3.11 displays the SNR values for the tf-PWS and linear stacks.
Figure 3.11: SNR averaged over all cross-correlations between all station pairs (solid line) computed with the tf-PWS stacking approach. The inset shows the SNR computed with the linear stacking approach.
To evaluate the uncertainties for dispersion velocities in each dispersion curve, the procedure of (Bensen et al. 2007) was applied. In that approach, dispersion curves are calculated from correlations developed within different periods of the year and with a fixed time lenght. Thus, if the dispersion curve is computed from cross-correlation of 3-months of data, using a year of data, there are up to twelve 3-month stacks: January-February-March, February-March-April, and so on. The dispersion curve uncertainty for each trajectory is then obtained from the standard deviation of the dispersion curves from the triplets. The standard deviation of a trajectory is calculated only if it has at least four triplets with SNR &gt; 7; otherwise, the uncertainty for the trajectory is set on the average standard deviation of all trajectories with enough triplets. An example for the trajectory is shown in figure 3.12. The figure shows that for periods between 7 and 40 s the average group velocity uncertainties for Rayleigh wave are less than 0.1 km/s, dropping significantly for intermediate periods to 0.04 km/s. For phase velocities, the standard deviation is much smaller, ranging from 0.002 to 0.07 km/s.

3.6	Tomographic inversion
The inter-station dispersion curves computed from ambient noise and those resulting from earthquakes sources, are inverted tomographically to produce phase and group velocity maps for NW South America at periods from 7 to 150 s. The non-linear, 2-D tomographic inversion technique developed by (Rawlinson &amp;amp; Sambridge 2003) is considered. Traveltimes through the 2-D model are computed using the fast marching algorithm (FMM) of (Sethian 1996), in which a finite-difference method is used to solve for the eikonal equation (forward problem). This technique brings considerable benefits over conventional ray-tracing methods, as it is more stable and successfully finds the first
arrival times for diffraction paths in shadow zones. The inversion algorithm, on the other hand, uses a gradient method based on the subspace technique of (Kennett et al. 1988), where the minimization is carried out simultaneously along several search directions that together span a subspace of the original model space (Rawlinson &amp;amp; Sambridge 2004, Rawlinson &amp;amp; Sambridge 2003).
3.6.1	Fast Marching Method (FMM)
The fast marching method (FMM) is a grid-based numerical scheme for tracking the evolution of monotonically advancing interfaces, via finite-difference solution of the ei-konal equation. In its simplest form, the FMM uses the first-order upwind difference scheme:
max(D-'T. -DjT.0)2
+max(j. -j0)2
— sijk.
(3.12)
+max(D-T.-D+T. 0)2
where the finite difference operator notation used is defined as
(3.13)
(3.14)
D+xT — T(x + bx) - T(x)
bx
D-xT = T(x)	- T(x -	§x)
bx
with Dijk the slowness at grid point (i. j. k). Realize that eq. (3.12) is a non-linear equation (quadratic) for the traveltime Tjk for which, out the two possible solutions, the larger value is always the correct value. The FMM of Sethian and Popovici (1999) systematically constructs traveltimes T in a downwind fashion from known values upwind using a narrow band scheme. The the scheme is illustrated in Figure 3.13, where the narrow band represents the propagating wavefront, and the grid points are labelled as either alive, close
or far, depending on whether they have had the narrow band passing through them, they are inside it, or are yet to be touched by it, respectively.

The FMM begins from a source point (or wavefront), and computes the traveltimes at neighboring node points using, for example, Eq. (3.11) to generate the first stage of the narrow band. The point with minimum traveltime is then accepted as alive (it is a true first-arrival traveltime), and all points neighboring this alive point are updated (if close) or calculated for the first time (if far), in which case they become close and the narrow band progresses downwind (see Figure 3.14).

3.6.2	Subspace inversion method
The second stage is the inversion procedure, which follows an iterative, non-linear scheme known as the subspace approach (Kennett et al. 1988). The scheme provides a model for the local phase and group velocities that best explains the interstation traveltimes. The subspace approach significantly reduces the computational effort during the inversion.
The functional to be inverted consists of a data residual term and two regularization terms:
S(m) = (g(m) - dobs)TC-1 (g(m) - dobs) + e(m - m0)TCm 1 (m - m0) + qmTDTDm,
(3.15)
where g(m) represents the predicted traveltimes from -the model m, m0 is an initial estimate of the model, dobs is a vector of traveltimes, Cd is the data covariance matrix filled
with variances based on uncertainty from the 3-months stacks, and Cm is the a priori model covariance matrix with uniform a priori variances based on a model parameter uncertainty. D is the derivative operator, which has the role of smoothing the model, and £ and n are the damping and smoothing parameters, respectively.
To overcome the non-linearity of g, the minimization of the objective function is performed using an iterative approach:
mn+i = mn + 8m,	(3.16)
where 8m is found iteratively using the subspace method. At each iteration, the subspace method restricts the minimization of the quadratic approximation of S(m) to a p-dimensional subspace of the original model space, so that the perturbation 8m occurs in the space spanned by a set of p M-dimensional basis vectors {aj]. The perturbation is expressed as
n
8m =	a7' = A//,	(3.17)
i=1
where A = aj is the Mxp projection matrix. The component u determines the length of the corresponding vector aj that minimizes the objective function S(m) in the space spanned by aj. The final expression for the model update can be written as:
8m = -A[At (Gt C-1G + £Cm1 + nDT D)A]-1At y,	(3.18)
where G is the Frechet matrix of partial derivatives. Since the projection matrix A is orthonormal, A model update 8m is readily obtained by the inversion of a relatively small part of the n x n matrix. After each update of the model, the surface waves are retraced through the updated model using the fast marching method described above, and the terms of A, Y and G are then re-computed.
The tomographic inverse problem is generally ill-posed in a Hadamard's sense (Tikhonov &amp;amp; Arsenin 1977), implying the existence of many solutions but, above all, the presence of instability; that is, small perturbations in dobs, such as noise present in the seismological observations, can result in large variations in the solution. The solution to this difficulty lies in the regularization of the solution (Tikhonov &amp;amp; Arsenin 1977), that is, in the introduction of constraints in the inversion functional (second and third terms in eq. (3.14)). One of the most standard ways of estimating the ideal value of the regularization is the so-called L-curve criterion or trade-off curve. This criterion is based on the fact that the dependency of data misfit with respect to a model characteristic is supposed to have shape of letter L. The most appropriate model is chosen as that corresponding to the corner of the L-curve, where the sufficient decrease of the data misfit is achieved by the model with the smallest complexity.

(b) Data misfit (RMS) vs model perturbation for different values of £. (c) RMS data misfit variation vs number of iterations; note that with 4 iterations convergence is reached.
The regularization parameters (£ e n) are chosen by inspecting the trade-off between RMS (root mean square) misfit and model roughness, and RMS misfit and model variance, respectively. Model roughness is defined as mTDTDm and model variance as
(m — m0)TCm1(m — m0) (see eq. (3.14) and figure 3.15). The choice of parameters is done systematically as described in (Rawlinson &amp;amp; Sambridge 2005). Figure 3.16 displays sample trade-off curves for both group and phase velocity corresponding to tomographic inversions at 22 s period, demonstrating values of £ = 9 and n = 10 for group velocities, and £ = 3 and n = 2 for phase velocities. Parameters for tomographic inversions at other periods are similar, ranging between 0.3 and 10 for smoothness (£) and between 0.3 and 9.0 for damping (n). Similar plots are built to investigate the required number of iterations, demonstrating that 6 iterations generally suffice to achieve convergence.
3.7	Inversion for Shear-wave velocity
Local dispersion curves can be extracted from the tomographic maps for each grid point, and the resulting dispersion curves can then be inverted to obtain 1D velocitydepth profiles of S-wave velocity. To this purpose, two methodologies were adopted: the Neighborhood Algorithm (NA) (Sambridge 1999), and a Linearized Inversion Method (Ammon et al. 1990).
3.7.1	Neighborhood Algorithm (NA)
The Neighborhood Algorithm (NA) (Sambridge 1999) was used to invert Rayleigh phase and group velocities for S-velocity structure. The NA is a global optimization method similar to genetic algorithms (Lomax &amp;amp; Snieder 1994) and simulated annealing (Sen &amp;amp; Stoffa 1991). These methods work by exploring the range of possible solutions in a quasi-random form. The result is a family of solutions that includes the best-fitting models in the parameter space. The neighborhood algorithm (NA) is a direct search scheme, so it does not require the presence of an initial model or linearization of the inverse problem (Wathelet 2008).
The NA makes use of Voronoi cells to model the misfit function across the parameter
space and offers a robust sampling of the solution space. The formal Voronoi cell definition is as follows: let P = [m1,..., mnp] be a set of points in the d-space, where 2 &amp;lt;np &amp;lt;«&gt;, and let m1 = mj for i = j. The Voronoi cell about point mi is given by:
V(mi) = {x| || x- mi ||&lt;|| x- mj || forj = i, (i, j = 1,...,np)}	(3.19)
The Voronoi cell formulation is later utilized to resolve the forward problem with the formulation proposed in (Dunkin 1965) to evaluate the misfit function for different solutions. The misfit functions are defined through the L2-norm between the dispersion curve predicted by the model and the one constructed from the tomographic maps. The misfit function is given as:
||(ma - mb) || = [(ma - mb)TCM1 (ma - mb)]1/2,	(3.20)
The equation above represents the distance between models ma and mb. CM is a matrix that non-dimensionalizes the parameter space.
The sequence of steps taken during the application of the NA are as follows:
•	Generation of ns model samples, uniformly in parameter space and with associated Voronoi cells.
•	Calculation of the misfit functions from the generated models and ranking of the nr lowest misfit models.
•	Creation of ns new models inside the Voronoi cells for the nr lowest misfit models by uniform random walk.
•	Reiterate from step 2.
The software package Dinver (http://www.geopsy.org), implemented by Wathelet 2008, combines the forward modeling algorithm of Dunkin (1965) with an improved version of
the original NA. This implementation has been applied successfully by several authors (e.g. (Behr et al. 2010, Kao et al. 2013, Kohler et al. 2012)).
3.7.2	Linearized Inversion Method
A second method to invert for Shear velocities is the the linearized, iterative inversion scheme described in Ammon et al. (1990), in which the RMS misfit between observed and predicted dispersion velocities is minimized in a least-square sense, with smoothness constraints on the inverted velocity-depth profile. The method was originally developed for the inversion of receiver functions, and expanded to the joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion in Julia et al. (2003). It can be easily used for the inversion of dispersion curves alone from the joint inversion implementation.
Let’s start by expressing forward problem as
y = F[x]
(3.21)
where y is a N-dimensional vector of data points, F[] is a non-linear operator that maps vectors in the model space into vectors in the data space, and x is a M-dimensional vector that contains shear wave velocities for fixed-thickness layers at depth. Let’s now expand eq. (3.21) in a Taylor series
y « F[xo] + VF|x0 • [x - x©]
(3.22)
where x0 is the starting model. To make the dependence of the final model with respect
to the initial model more explicit, eq. (3.22) can be re-arranges as
y - F[xo] + VF|xo • xo = VF|xo • x
(3.23)
or, alternatively, as
y' — VF|x0 • x.	(3.24)
where y' is the modified vector of residuals. The solution is then obtained in a linearized and iterative fashion as
Xi+1 — (VF|xi )-1 • y'.	(3.25)
The inverse operator (VF|Xi) — G-1 is obtained by minimizing the functional 9, composed of a least squares term and a smoothing parameter
9 — (Ay - GAx)T(Ay - GAx) + 0((Ax)TATA(Ax) - GAx)	(3.26)
where 0 is an adjustable parameter that controls the trade-off between fitting the waveform and the smoothness of the model. This value is computed through L-curve analysis. The matrix A constructs the second difference of the model m.

Upper and middle crustal velocity structure of the Colombian Andes from ambient noise tomography (Paper I)
The following article, entitled Upper and middle crustal velocity structure of the Colombian Andes from ambient noise tomography: Investigating subduction-related magmatism in the overriding plate, reports on the results obtained from ambient noise cross-correlations at 52 broadband stations in NW South America. 3-D maps of S-velocity variation were produced for the region for the upper and middle crust. The results suggest that slow S velocities under the Central Cordillera have been attributed to accumulation of magmas in the middle crust generated in the underlying mantle wedge. In addition, evidence of magmatic activity was reported under the inactive volcanoes of the Eastern Cordillera. Slow S-velocities in the Caribbean middle crust were related to asthenosphe-ric melts that would have breached the Caribbean flat slab through a vertical tear. This manuscript was accepted in 13 JAN 2018 and published online 23 JAN 2018 in Journal of Geophysical Research - Solid Earth (JGR). DOI: 10.1002/2017JB014688

Abstract
New maps of S-velocity variation for the upper and middle crust making up the northwestern most corner of South America have been developed from cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise at 52 broadband stations in the region. Over 1300 empirical Green’s functions, reconstructing the Rayleigh-wave portion of the seismic wave-field, were obtained after time-and frequency-domain normalization of the ambient noise recordings and stacking of 48 months of normalized data. Inter-station phase- and group-velocity curves were then measured in the 638 s period range and tomographically inverted to produce maps of phase- and group-velocity variation in a 0.5 ° x 0.5 ° grid. Velocity-depth profiles were developed for each node after simultaneously inverting phase- and group-velocity curves and combined to produce 3-D maps of S-velocity variation for the region. The S-velocity models reveal a ~7 km thick sedimentary cover in the Caribbean region, the Magdalena Valley, and the Cordillera Oriental, as well as crustal thicknesses in the Pacific and Caribbean region under ~35 km, consistent with previous studies. They also display zones of slow velocity at 25-35 km depth under regions of both active and inactive volcanism, suggesting the presence of melts that carry the signature of segmented subduction into the overriding plate. A low velocity zone in the same depth-range is imaged under the Lower Magdalena Basin in the Caribbean region, which may represent either sub-lithospheric melts ponding at mid-crustal levels after breaching through a fractured Caribbean flat slab or fluid migration through major faults within the Caribbean crust.
Key words: ambient noise tomography; Colombian Andes; subduction-related magmatism.
1.	Introduction
The recent tectonic evolution of Northwestern South America has been shaped by the complex interactions of up to three different lithospheric plates: South America, Caribbean, and Nazca. It is accepted that this corner of the continent maintains a record of Grenvillian basement, originated during the amalgamation and disassembly of western Pangaea [Spikings et al., 2015]. The subsequent collision of the Caribbean Igneous province created new crust, which was added to the Pacific margin during Early and Late Cretaceous times [Escalona and Mann, 2011], and emplaced the Panama arc in western Colombia during Middle Miocene times [Restrepo and Toussaint, 1988; Taboada et al., 2000; Cediel et al., 2003]. These terrains were later reworked and altered by convergence-related processes. The end result is the present configuration of the Colombian Andes (north of the Ecuadorian border) into three main ranges - the Eastern Cordillera, the Central Cordillera, and the Western Cordillera - and two intervening valleys - the Middle Magdalena Valley, and the Cauca-Patia Valley - separating the ranges (Figure 1). The origin and composition of these three main ranges are essentially different, each of them deriving from distinct tectonic processes driven by plate convergence [Taboada et al., 2000; Cediel et al., 2003]. The composition of the South American plate is presently being altered by subduction-related volcanism, which reaches as far north as ~6oN latitude. Volcanism is active along the Central Cordillera and inactive along the Eastern Cordillera, and is offset at 5oN latitude by ~270 km in the EW direction, following the pattern delineated by intermediate, subduction-related seismicity [e.g. Pennington, 1981; Vargas and Mann, 2013], The NW corner of South America thus constitutes a unique tectonic setting to investigate how subduction-related processes deform and alter the composition of the overriding plate.
Passive-source seismic studies in the region have focused mainly on the relative geometry of the subducting Nazca and Caribbean plates under South America [Pennington, 1981; van der Hilst and Mann, 1994; Vargas and Mann, 2003, Chiarabba et al., 2016; Syracuse et al., 2016]. An early study by Pennington [1981], for instance, used patterns of seismicity and focal mechanisms to define two separate segments of subducted lithosphere - Cauca and Bucaramanga - that were associated to the Nazca and Caribbean plates, respectively. The segments were found to be dipping at different angles, thus defining a slab window within the South American mantle that explained the offset of intermediate-depth seismicity and surface volcanism. The detailed geometry of the slab window was later refined through seismic tomography, suggesting either superposition of the Nazca and Caribbean plates [van der Hilst and Mann, 1994], tearing of the Caribbean slab [Vargas and Mann, 2013], tearing of the Nazca slab [Chiarabba et al., 2016], or even multiple tears segmenting the subducting plates [Corredor, 2003; Syracuse et al., 2016]. Fewer studies have focused on the structure of the overriding South American plate. Refraction surveys, for instance, were performed in southern Colombia as part of the Narino Project [Aldrich et al., 1973; Ocola et al., 1975; Meissnar et al., 1976; Meyer et al., 1976; Mooney et al., 1979], producing a crustal cross-section for the region; and a 1D velocity model for the Colombian crust was developed by Ojeda and Havskov [2001], seeking to improve accuracy in location of crustal seismicity. On a more regional scale, crustal thickness was surveyed by Poveda et al. [2015], based on receiver functions analysis and a published compilation of crustal thickness observations; and images of lateral P- and S-wave velocity variation between 12.5 and 155 km depth were developed by Syracuse et al. [2016], although with no tectonic interpretation at crustal levels. In spite of these efforts, therefore, a regional-scale investigation of lateral
seismic velocity variation of the overriding South American plate is still missing.
Surface-wave tomography has been successfully utilized to image the continental lithosphere at several scales [e.g. Feng et al., 2004, Ritsema et al., 2004]. Tomographic images from naturally-occurring surface-waves, however, rarely provide information at periods shorter than 20 s, which are required to probe into the upper and middle crust [Levshin and Ritzwoller, 2001]. Fortunately, the modal representation of ambient seismic noise for a diffuse wavefield with an homogeneous source distribution has demonstrated that surface-wave imaging at local-to-regional scales can be performed with ambient seismic noise [Sabra et al., 2005; Snieder, 2004]. Indeed, an ever increasing number of ambient seismic noise studies have been produced during the last decade mapping different parts of the globe [e.g. Shapiro et al., 2005; Yao et al., 2006; Stehly et al., 2006; Bensen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2007; Villasenor et al., 2007; Saygin and Kennett, 2010; Ward et al., 2013; Mottaghi et al., 2013; Boue et al., 2014; Abdetedal et al., 2015; Haned et al., 2016]. These studies have conclusively demonstrated that empirical Green’s function recovery from average cross-correlations of ambient noise between pairs of seismic stations is capable of providing tight constraints on upper and middle crustal structure.
In this study, we use information derived from cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise between pairs of permanent seismic stations in NW South America to reconstruct the surfacewave portion of the empirical Green’s functions and develop surface-wave tomographic images at periods sampling upper and mid-crustal levels. More specifically, we utilize seismic stations deployed by the Colombian Geological Survey between 2012 to 2015 in and around the Andean
region to reconstruct the empirical Green’s functions for all possible pairs of stations, and develop high-quality, Rayleigh-wave group- and phase-velocity tomographic images at periods between 6 and 38 s. Our tomographic study includes more than ~780 interstation raypaths that sample the region, derived from ~1300 empirical Green’s functions imaging the upper and middle crust at an unprecedented resolution in the region. The group and phase-velocity maps are further inverted for isotropic S-wave velocity structure, building a detailed 3D S-velocity model for the middle and upper crust under NW South America. The resulting images show an excellent correlation with surface geology at shallow depths, and reveal low-velocity patterns at mid-crustal depths (25-35 km) that correlate with active and inactive surface volcanism in the central portion of the Eastern Cordillera and the southern flank of the Central Cordillera, respectively. These low-velocity anomalies are interpreted as magmas derived from the mantle wedge above the Nazca and Caribbean plates. More strikingly, a similar low-velocity anomaly is also observed under the Lower Magdalena Basin, where flat subduction of the Caribbean plate has prevented the occurrence of surface volcanism. We argue that this low-velocity region represents either the signature of fluid expulsion near crustal faults or upwelling magmas from the underlying asthenosphere, which would have breached the flat-subducting Caribbean plate through a preexisting fracture and pond at mid-crustal levels within the overriding plate.
2.	Geology and Crustal Structure
2.1.	Geology and tectonic setting
NW South America is broadly divided into the northern Andes, the Caribbean region, and the
Eastern Llanos. The northern Andes comprise the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, which are structured into three main ranges (Eastern Cordillera, Central, Cordillera, and Western Cordillera) and two intervening valleys (Middle Magdalena Valley, and Cauca-Patia Valley). Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks form the basement of the Eastern Cordillera and the Central Cordillera, immediatelly West of the Guyana Shield. The Eastern Cordillera is covered by sequences of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, while the Central Cordillera is dotted by instances of Meso-Cenozoic batholits related to subduction of the Nazca plate. Cenozoic andesitic volcanism dominates the southern portion of the Central Cordillera (Figure 1). The Western Cordillera, on the other hand, consists of oceanic rocks that accreted during Cretaceous and early Cenozoic times, and are covered by sedimentary rocks. The division between the Western and the Central Cordilleras are the Cauca Valley and the Romeral Fault System, which separate the accreted oceanic part from the provinces of continental affinity next to the Guyana shield (Figure 1). The separation between the Central and the Western Cordilleras is marked by the presence of the Middle Magdalena Valley, which is covered by sequences of Cretaceous, Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary sedimentary rocks from the Eastern and the Central Cordilleras. In the northernmost corner of the northern Andes outcrops the Santa Marta Massif, which includes Jurassic volcanics and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, along with volcano-sedimentary Cretaceous materials [Cardona et al., 2011].
The Caribbean region can be geologically described as an Oligocene-to-Recent forearc basin -the Lower Magdalena Basin (LMB) - overlying the shallowly dipping Caribbean slab [Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b; Mora-Bohorquez et al., 2017]. The LMB is in turn composed of several subduction-related basins, such as the Plato, San Jorge, and Sinu-San Jacinto basins, and is
bounded to the West by Sinú-San Jacinto fold-and-thrust belt. The Plató and San Jorge basins consist of Paleogene sediments overlying Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic basement rocks, while the Sinú-San Jacinto fold-and-thrust belt is regarded as an accretionary wedge that includes rocks of Cretaceous age as well as Tertiary and Quaternary lacustrine sediments. The sedimentary prism making up the Sinú-San Jacinto basin extends offshore along the margin of the northern South American Plate, with thicknesses of up to 10 km [Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Flinch, 2003; Montes et al., 2010; Lara et al., 2013; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b]. The Eastern Llanos represent an extensive foreland basin associated to the Andean orogen that overlays the Guyana craton [e.g., Farris et al., 2011].
The northern Andes and the Caribbean region behave as a coherent tectonic unit known as the North Andean Block (NAB), which can thus be regarded as a collage of several terrains that accreted against the Guyana Shield at different stages through Earth’s history [Restrepo and Toussaint, 1988; Cediel et al., 2003]. The latest addition to the NAB is the Panamá arc, which includes the Baudó Range and represents an oceanic, basic and ultramafic magmatic arc covered by oceanic sediments [Case et al., 1971; Restrepo and Toussaint, 1988; Taboada et al., 2000; Cediel et al., 2003]. Flueh et al., [1981] reported sedimentary sequences with thicknesses between 7.5 and 10 km under the Panama arc. The Panama arc is thus seen as an exotic terrain within the NAB [Duque-Caro, 1990; Taboada et al., 2000].
The present geology of northwestern South America is partly the result of a complex interplay between the South American (overriding) plate and the (subducting) Nazca and Caribbean plates. An initial model of this interplay was proposed by Pennington [1981]. Through careful selection
of hypocentral locations of earthquakes and focal mechanisms in the region, the author identified two distinct segments of subducted lithosphere beneath the Colombian Andes: the Bucaramanga segment, related to subduction of the Caribbean Plate; and the Cauca segment, related to subduction of the Nazca Plate. These two segments would have resulted from the collision of the Panamá istmus against South America and buoyancy of partially subducted bathimetric features, implicitly implying the existence of a slab tear at depth separating the postulated segments. The Bucaramanga segment would be subducting in the N109oE direction and dipping at 20o-25o, while the Cauca segment would be subducting in the N35oE direction with a 35o dip.
Although several studies have been conducted to investigate the precise contact geometry between the Nazca and Caribbean plates, this issue still remains a debate. Tomographic images developed by van der Hilst and Mann [1994], imaged oblique convergence of the Caribbean and Nazca slabs (including the Panama istmus segment), showing an overlap between latitudes 5.2oN and 7oN with both plates being simultaneously overridden by the South American plate. This interpretation was adopted in Cortés and Angelier [2005] and Taboada et al. [2000]. Vargas and Mann [2013], on the other hand, return to the slab tear model of Pennington [1981]. From additional earthquake locations accumulated during the intervening years, coda-Q tomography, and regional magnetic and gravity data, they propose the existence of a lithospheric, ~240 km wide, east-west trending slab tear at 5oN latitude - the Caldas tear - that separates the shallowly-dipping Panama arc indenter from the more steeply dipping normal oceanic crust of the Nazca plate. Similar to Pennington [1981], they further propose that the tear would have resulted from the collision of the Panamá arc and buoyancy of a subducted oceanic ridge. Tomographic imaging by Chiarabba et al. [2016] places the tear entirely within the Nazca plate, pushing the
boundary of this plate north and indicating an EW trending slab tear separating a steeply subducting segment to the south from a flat subducting segment to the north. Finally, Syracuse et al. [2016] presented 3D models of P- and S-velocity variation for the mantle and hypocentral relocations based on the joint inversion of local body wave arrivals, surface-wave dispersion measurements, and gravity data. They imaged up to three separate slab fragments, separated by two slab windows: one at about 5oN, coinciding with the termination of active volcanism; and one at 7.5oN, marking the location of the Bucaramanga seismic nest. The region at ~5.5°N (Northern termination of volcanism) is interpreted as a non-overlaping slab tear of the Nazca plate, where intermediate-depth seismicity is shifted ~200 km toward the East, beneath Eastern Cordillera. A similar model had been previously proposed by Corredor [2003] from a threedimensional model of CMT solutions and other seismicity in northwestern South America.
In spite of the many interpretations from tomographic imaging, all models seem to agree that the Nazca plate is subducting with an average angle of 35o in a nearly eastward direction, although with high variability along the subduction front and, therefore, presenting segmentation [Gutscher et al., 1999]. The Caribbean Plate, on the other hand, would be subducting at shallower dip angle&amp;lt;10° in a WNW-ESE direction [Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015a; Mora-Bohorquez et al., 2017], with no apparent signs of segmentation. All models also agree that the shift in intermediate-depth seismicity and surface volcanism would be the result of deep versus shallow subduction along the Colombian trench.
2.2.	Crustal structure
The average crustal structure of the NW Andean region can be obtained from continental-scale models. Chulick et al., 2013 for instance, presented contour maps and statistical analyses of the seismic structure of the crust and upper mantle, based on a large seismic compilation of multiple datasets. They reported an average crustal thickness of 38 km for South America, with a maximum crustal thickness estimate of 60 km for Colombia. Feng et al. [2007; 2004] and Lloyd et al. [2010], on the other hand, produced tomographic images from surface-wave dispersion with ~200 km resolution in the continent; although ray coverage is low for northern Colombia, crustal thickness is reported to be in the 40-50 km range. These values are consistent with thickness up to 45 km for the Colombian Andes and 33 km for the Lower Magdalena Basin reported from analysis of satellite gravity measurements from the GOCE mission by van der Meijde et al. [2013].
The most complete survey of crustal structure for the NW Andean region is the crustal thickness map presented in Poveda et al. [2015] from receiver function analysis, which has been updated here following the procedures described in their study. We include 11 new stations (Fig. 2) that improve the sampling of the Caribbean region and the Western and Central Cordillera. A close inspection of the figure reveals that the crust in the southern Pacific Coast is about 22 km thick, increasing to about 30 km under the Panama arc. The WC is characterized by thicknesses between 30 km south of 4°N and 40 km north of this latitude, similar to those observed under the Cauca Valley. Crustal thickness increases to 52-58 km beneath the northern Central Cordillera and to almost 60 km beneath some of the volcanoes of the Southern Cordilleran system; in the EC, crustal thickness is between 55 and 60 km. In the Middle Magdalena Valley, separating the CC from the EC, crustal thickness is around 45 km. In the Caribbean region, the crust is ~30 km
thick under the Sinu-San Jacinto Basin, and ~35 km thick under Lower Magdalena Basin, the Plato Basin, and the San Jorge Basin. These variations may be due to the shallowly dipping Caribbean slab [Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015a]. Beneath the Santa Marta Massif, the uptaded crustal thickness map displays a crustal thickness of ~40 km, decreasing to ~30 km under the Guajira Peninsula.
Detailed velocity structure was developed from active-source profiling in southern Colombia as part of Narino Project [Aldrich et al., 1973; Meyer et al., 1976; Ocola et al., 1975], where the crust between 1°N and 4°N latitude, and 82°W and 76°W longitude was mapped with seismic refraction lines [Meissnar et al., 1976]. In the off-shore portion, results revealed P-wave velocities of ~3.2 km/s for the upper crust (top 5 km) and 6.8 km/s for the lower crust (down to 15 km); on-shore, P-wave velocities ranged between 6.0 and 6.8 km/s for the upper and lower crusts, and were found to be ~8.0 km/s in the underlying mantle. Crustal thicknesses ranged between 30 and 40 km in the region, with upper and lower crustal thicknesses of 11-19 km and 15-25 km, respectively. Bowland and Rosencratz, 1988 investigated the upper crustal structure of the Caribbean sea region from multichannel seismic refraction, and found that oceanic crust is between 10 and 15 km thick, with P-velocities around 4.5 km/s in the upper crust, 7.0 km/s in the lower crust, and 8.2 km/s in the uppermost mantle.
From relocalization of hypocenters, Ojeda and Havskov [2001] developed a 1D crustal velocity model that improved location accuracy of local (crustal) seismicity, and Ojeda and Ottemoller, [2002] developed a local QLg tomography that defined several crustal regions according to attenuation values. Ojeda and Havskov [2001] developed a regional model with three layers for
the crust (32 km), with P-wave velocities of 4.8, 6.6 and 7.0 km/s with thicknesses of 4, 21 and
7.5	km respectively, and an upper mantle velocity between 8.0 and 8.1 km/s. A constant Vp/Vs ratio of 1.78 was determined for the entire data set. Ojeda and Ottemoller [2002], on the other hand, subdivided the central portion of the study area into 7 zones, according to attenuation characteristics of QLg. The principal regions with high attenuation correspond to active volcanic areas and the northeastern cordillera, which is characterized by young sedimentary rocks and lacustrine sediments, and high water content in the Bogotá altiplano.
Finally, as mentioned above, images of lateral P- and S-wave velocity variation for depths ranging between 12.5 and 155 km were produced in the recent tomographic study of Syracuse et al. [2016]. As the crustal slices in that study are directly comparable to our velocity models, we postpone the discussion of those images until section 6, where they will be compared to the results developed here from ambient noise tomography.
3.	Data and Data Processing
3.1. The dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of the continuous recordings of the 50 seismic stations of the Red Sismológica Nacional de Colombia (RSNC), which is operated by the Colombian Geological Survey (SGC), and 3 nearby Global Seismograph Network (GSN) stations in Ecuador, Venezuela, and Panamá. In total, it makes a combined network of 53 permanent broadband stations that recorded continuously from 2012-04 through 2015-12. The equipment is quite heterogenous, and consists of a combination of Streckeisen STS-2, Güralp CMG-3T,
Guralp CMG3-ESP, Trillium 120p, Reftek 151-120A, and Reftek 152B-120 broadband sensors (flat response in velocity down to 120 s) feeding high-gain digitizers (Quanterra Q330, Guralp DM24, and Taurus) sampling continuously at 100 samples per second. We considered all accessible vertical component data within the recording time window from all the permanent stations. Figure 3 displays the location of the broadband stations, color-coded by recording time window duration, while Table 1 lists station coordinates and recording time windows. Realize that, because the network was gradually built, the amount of data available among the stations may vary. The final dataset offers good spatial and azimuthal coverage for the Colombian Andes and most of the Caribbean region of Colombia, with an average inter-station spacing of approximately 400 kilometers, and minimum and maximum inter-station distances of 20 km and 1300 km, respectively.
3.2.	Empirical Green’s functions
To retrieve the empirical Green’s functions by cross-correlation, we followed the approach described in Shapiro and Campillo, [2004], Sabra et al., [2005] and Bensen et al. [2007], with modifications. Data processing can be divided into three stages: (i) pre-processing, (ii) crosscorrelation, and (iii) stacking. Only vertical-component data were considered, which implies that only the Rayleigh wave portion of the empirical Green’s function were reconstructed by crosscorrelation. The aim of the pre-processing stage is to decrease the influence of earthquake signals and instrumental irregularities from the time-series prior to cross-correlation. It starts with cutting the continuous recordings into non-overlapping, 1-day long segments, which are demeaned, detrended, and tapered with a 5% cosine window. Instrumental responses are then
deconvolved from the daily time series to be bandpass-filtered between 0.01 and 0.2 Hz and decimated to 1 sample per second. Time- and frequency-domain normalization is then applied to remove the signature of seismicity within the frequency-band of interest. Temporal normalization is implemented through one-bit normalization, preserving the phase and neglecting amplitude variations within the time series [Larose, 2004; Bensen et al., 2007]; frequency-domain normalization or “spectral whitening” normalizes spectral amplitudes to unit value without altering the phase, effectively broadening the frequency-band of the ambient noise recordings [e.g. Bensen et al., 2007]. After time-frequency normalization is applied to all 1-day long segments, cross-correlations are computed in the frequency domain for all station pairs for frequencies between 0.01 to 0.2 Hz.
Stacking of the one-day long ambient-noise cross-correlations is achieved through the timefrequency phase-weighted stack (tf-PWS) of Schimmel et al. [2011]. The tf-PWS makes use of the S-transform [Stockwell et al., 1996] to obtain a time-frequency representation for each crosscorrelogram, so that the stacking is controlled with frequency-dependent resolution while maintaining a close relationship between the time-averaging and the Fourier spectrum [Stockwell et al., 1996].
The time-frequency dependent phase coherence attenuates incoherent noise, because it allows for the determination of weak amplitude signals that are more phase-coherent than background noise. Signals obtained with this strategy have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than those obtained with conventional methods [e.g. the classical correlation and stack method; Villasenor et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2007; Bensen et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008].
A total of 1286 cross-correlation stacks were constructed from the assembled dataset. A record section of cross-correlations is displayed in Figure 4, where only those cross-correlations with SNR &gt; 20 are included for displaying purposes. The empirical Green’s functions clearly emerge from the ambient seismic noise for distances ranging between about 50 km and over 1100 km. Moreover, travel times correspond to propagation velocities between ~2.1 and ~3.2 km/s, which are consistent with short-period, fundamental-mode, Rayleigh-wave propagation.
Selection of stable empirical Green’s function was achieved through analysis of the coherence functional [Schimmel et al., 2011], which measures the similarity of two time-series. First, waveform similarity was calculated using the zero-lag cross-correlation between a reference trace (correlogram with maximum stack size) and a subset of correlograms that correspond to a fixed number of days, which are selected randomly with 30 days increments to the maximum stack length. Then, a plot of similarity versus number of days was built, so that signal emergence and minimum number of days could be assessed for each Green’s function for several interstation raypaths and azimuthal directions. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the process through select examples corresponding to two different inter-station raypaths. The first raypath (Fig. 5e) travels through the central portion of the Colombian Andes in the N-S direction, and has an interstation distance of 423 km, while the second raypath (Fig. 6e) samples the Eastern portion of the Caribbean region and the Central Cordillera and has an interstation distance of 723 km. The figures reveal that, for distances greater than 700 km, about 450 days (Figure 6a,b) are necessary for convergence of the empirical Green’s function; while for shorter raypaths of ~400 km, about 250 days seem to be enough (Figs 5a,b). This relatively large number of days required to achieve convergence contrasts with other studies in the stable portion of the continent, where just a few
weeks were enough to achieve convergence [e.g. Dias et al., 2015]. We think that the observed rate of convergence is probably due to the intense seismic activity in the country, especially around the Bucaramanga nest [Ojeda andHavskov, 2001; Zarifi et al., 2007; Prieto et al., 2012], which could not be fully mitigated through the standard time-frequency normalization process. This might be especially true for the URI-HEL interstation path (Figure 6a), which intersects the Bucaramanga nest. Note how stacking of just 100 days is not enough to recover both the causal and acausal portions of the empirical Green’s function, which is eventually recovered when adding additional one-day correlograms to the stack.
4.	Phase- and Group-Velocity Tomography
4.1. Measuring group and phase velocity
The empirical Green’s functions extracted in the previous section are dominated by surfacewaves. Group velocity can thus be measured by applying the time-frequency analysis (FTAN) of Levshin et al. [1972] and Levshin and Ritzwoller [2001], which is based on the application of a series of narrow bandpass-filters to the signal. The FTAN method also implements a phase-matched filter that cleans dispersion curves from multi-pathed signals [Herrin and Goforth, 1977], so that the whole procedure can be easily automated [Levshin and Ritzwoller, 2001]. Phase velocity can be measured from the empirical Green’s function as [Lin etal., 2008]
= kr + Ml + A + 2nN + ! — !,	(1)
where k is the wavenumber, r the interstation distance, m is the instantaneous frequency, t is the observed group-delay time, A is the source phase or initial phase, and 2nN represents the phase ambiguity term (with N = 0, ±1, ±2,). The phase corrections at the end of eq. (1) are specific to empirical Green’s functions from ambient noise cross-correlations. The n/2 represents the phase shift from the negative time-derivative, and the n/4 arises from interference of the non-stationary terms in a homogeneous noise source distribution [Lin et al., 2008; Snieder, 2004]. The phase ambiguity (2 nW) is assessed by comparing the long-period phase-velocity measurements to a reference curve, which here is based on the PREM global earth model [Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981]. Sometimes, FTAN fails to measure the dispersion curve due to abrupt jumps or spectral gaps. To overcome this shortcoming, the period window is reduced sequentially in bands from 5-100 s down to 5-30 s, in steps of 10 s.
To measure dispersion velocity, we first reject empirical Green’s functions with SNR &amp;lt;7 at each period. The tf-PWS technique of Schimmel et al, [2011] is quite successful in attenuating incoherent noise in the stacked cross-correlations, so the SNR is improved dramatically after increasing the number of available daily cross-correlations. Following Bensen et al. [2007], we also eliminate dispersion measurements on cross-correlations with inter-station distances less than three wavelengths. To estimate uncertainties, we applied the repeatibility of measurements through seasonal variability. First, we selected 12 overlapping, 3 month-long time series for each interstation path for a time window between 2012 to 2015. The first 3-month stack will include data from January through March for each year between 2012 and 2015, the second 3-month stack will include data from February through April for each year between 2012 to 2015, and so on. After the dispersion curve for group and phase velocity is measured for all the 3-month long
cross-correlations, the standard deviation is calculated if at least half of the twelve 3-month stacks have a SNR greater than 7. If this criteria is not satisfied, the standard deviation is taken as the average value for all the raypaths.
Figures 5 and 6 also illustrate the measuring of dispersion velocities through two select empirical Green’s functions. The figures reveal that the stability of the dispersion curves is slightly dependent on interstation distance, especially for periods longer than 20 s, where microseismic energy decays abruptly [Bromirski, 2009]. For the raypath through the central part of the Colombian Andes (Fig. 5), the dispersion curve reveals normal dispersion between 7-22 s with an average group velocity of ~3.2 km/s. The standard deviations, calculated from seasonal variability, are around 0.05 km/s and 0.03 km/s for group and phase velocity, respectively (Fig. 5c). For the raypath sampling the Eastern portion of the Lower Magdalena Basin and the Central Cordillera (Fig. 6), we observe a gradual increase in both phase and group velocity between 7-40 s, with standard deviations of ~0.07 km/s for group velocity and ~0.02 km/s for phase velocity (Fig. 6c). The final results of FTAN processing are shown in Figures 5d and 6d, where the dispersion curves for phase and group velocity are clean of spurious and multi-pathed signals. Also note how for the longer raypath (Fig. 6c), the dispersion curve obtained from the empirical Green’s function is not stable at long periods when stacking only 100 days, in accordance with the lack of convergence of the empirical Green’s function noted in the previous section.
The average group and phase velocity uncertainties, number of measurements that passed the quality control, average arrival time uncertainty, and average raypath length for each period are displayed in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows that for periods between 6 and 30 s the average group
velocity uncertainties are less than 0.1 km/s, dropping significantly for intermediate periods to ~0.05 km/s. For phase velocities, the standard deviation is much smaller, ranging from ~0.06 to ~0.1 km/s, with a minimum of 0.04 km/s at 14-22 s. Our uncertainties are similar to those reported in independent studies with similar datasets [e.g. Lin et al., 2007; Mottaghi et al., 2013; Dias et al., 2015]. The greatest uncertainties are for periods &gt; 30s, which we believe are due to the decrease in amplitude of the microseismic noise spectrum at those periods that make it difficult to recover the empirical Green's function. Travel time uncertainties as a function of period are displayed in Figure 7c, which will be used to weight the datasets in the tomographic inversion (section 4.2). Figures 7b and 7d show the number of raypaths and the average path length in each period for the selected observations, respectively, demonstrating that the optimal coverage is in the intermediate period range of 12-30 s.
4.2.	Tomographic Inversion
The inter-station dispersion curves developed in the previous section are next inverted tomographically to produce phase and group-velocity maps of NW South America at different periods. The Fast Marching Surface Tomography (FMST) package of Rawlinson and Sambridge [2005] is utilized for the inversion. The formulation of the forward problem is based on the solution of the Eikonal equation by finite differentiation of the phase or group delays, thus mapping the evolution in time of the first-arriving wavefronts across the study area. This eikonal solver, known as the Fast Marching Method (FMM), is described in detail elsewhere [Sethian, 1996; Sethian and Popovici, 1999], and its migration to the surface-wave tomography problem can be found in Rawlinson and Sambridge [2005]. This methodology is advantageous when the
stations coverage is sparse, providing stable, robust solutions for wave propagation in heterogeneous media [Rawlinson and Sambridge, 2004]. The inversion procedure follows an iterative, nonlinear scheme know as the subspace method [Kennett et al., 1988], which acts by projecting the quadratic approximation of the objective function of the inversion into a multidimensional subspace. Therefore, at each iteration, the optimization functional S(m) is projected into a subspace of dimension smaller than the original parameter space in order to reduce the computational effort in the local linearization. More details of the subspace method can be found in Rawlinson and Sambridge [2004]. Because of the size of the study area and the amount of data, we found that it is not necessary to project in greater than one dimension. The optimization functional is defined as,
(2)
where m0 is the reference model, Cm is the a priori model covariance matrix, Cd is the data covariance matrix, and D is the second derivative smoothing operator. The parameters e (&gt; 0) and (&gt; 0) are the damping and smoothing regularization parameters, respectively. The smoothing parameter controls the trade-off between data misfit and model smoothness, while the damping parameter controls the trade-off between data misfit and proximity of the inverted model to a reference model m0 [Rawlinson and Sambridge, 2005].
A discretized grid consisting of 0.5° x 0.5° cells was defined throughout the study area, with a constant initial velocity taken from the average observed group or phase velocity at each period. Uncertainties from 3 month-stacks (Figure 7c) were then included in the objective function (Eq.
4) to define the covariance matrices. Appropriate regularization parameters, (. and ?'/, in the objective function were determined through L-curve analysis [Aster et al., 2012]. We explored several combinations of regularization parameters by varying the damping and smoothing from 0 to 100 in steps of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 for all periods. Figure 8 displays sample trade-off curves for both group and phase velocity tomographic inversions at 22 s, demonstrating values of e = 9 and = 10 for group velocities and e = 3 and =2 for phase velocities. Parameters for tomographic inversions at other periods are similar, ranging between 0.3 and 10 for smoothness (e) and between 0.3 and 9.0 for damping (^). Furthermore, the tomographic inversions converge after six iterations for the selected regularization values (Fig. 8c). Figure 8b, also shows that model variance decreases to an average of ~0.015 km2/s2 (group) and ~0.01 km2/s2 (phase) with our selected parameters or, equivalently, to average standard deviations of ~0.12 km/s and ~0.1 km/s, respectively. These values are within the confidence bounds of the observed dispersion curves obtained from the 3-month stacks and are sufficiently high to indicate that the data are not overfitted.
The robustness of the tomographic inversions depends mostly on the azimuthal coverage of the seismic raypaths. Figure 7b already showed that path density is best for periods between 12 to 30 s, with over 800 measurements for both group and phase velocities. However, the azimuthal raypath distribution is not uniform in the study region, being highest for the central part of Colombia and gradually decreasing towards the edges of the study area. To assess the bias due to poor raypath coverage, we used standard checkerboard tests at each period. The tests were performed using input models of alternating fast and slow velocity defined through a grid of nodes with B-spline cubic interpolation with the same grid size, same ray-path geometry, and
same regularization values as for the real model. Each input model had velocities varying ±0.5 km/s around a background velocity for each dispersion map. Additionally, Gaussian noise was added to the synthetic group and phase arrival times for all station pairs. A series of checkerboard tests mimicking the ray-path coverage of all inversion periods (i.e., 7 s, 14 s, 22 s, 30 s, 34 and 38 s) are shown in the Figure 9. The recovery is very good in the center of the study area, especially in the Andean region, but the recovery worsens in the northern part of the Caribbean region (Guajira peninsula), the Pacific coast bordering with Ecuador, and also towards the edges, especially at long periods. Nonetheless, the recovery of the velocity contrasts is excellent. Similar results hold for checkerboard tests using phase velocities (not shown).
4.3.	Phase and Group Velocity Images
Figure 10 displays the tomographic results for group- and phase- velocity for periods of 7, 22 and 34 s; the remaining group and phase velocity maps can be found in the Supplementary Material section (Figures S1 and S2). The group and phase velocity maps are organized in order of increasing period, therefore increasing penetration depth into the crust. Group velocities, for instance, sample down to a depth approximately equal to one-third of their wavelength; thus, short periods (7 - 10 s) are a good indicator of sedimentary structure, while periods above 30 s are primarily sensitive to the S-wave velocity structure at ~30 km of depth. The tomographic maps at short periods (7 s) show an excellent correlation with surface geology (recall Figure 1). The main sedimentary basins, such as the Lower and Middle Magdalena valleys, the Túmaco basin along the Pacific coast, the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela, and the sediments covering the Panamá arc, are clearly depicted by slow phase and group velocities, as well as the Eastern Cordillera between latitudes 4°N - 6°N, which is geologically expressed as a Cretaceous
sedimentary basin. In contrast, the provinces composed of igneous-metamorphic complexes, such as the Santa Marta massif, the Santander massif, the Central Cordillera - which includes the Antioquia and Ibagué batholiths (AB, IB) - the Western Cordillera, and the southern segment of the Eastern Cordillera - which encompasses the Garzon massif - are mapped with higher-thanaverage velocities.
At intermediate periods of 22 s a similar pattern is observed, especially for group velocities. This is because some of the sedimentary structure leaks into the longer periods, which keep some sensitivity to shallow structure as well as upper crustal structure. This is especially true for the accretionary wedge making up the Caribbean in the Sinú-San Jacinto fold-belt and the Lower Magdalena Basin regions along the Atlantic coast of Colombia, which consist of ~10 km thick deposits [Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Vernette et al., 1992; Montes et al., 2010; Lara et al., 2013] and for the sedimentary basins along the Pacific coast that possess a similar accretionary wedge, although not as thick as in the Caribbean. Phase velocities, on the other hand, seem to be sampling deeper structure when compared to the corresponding group velocities. Slow velocities are still mapped within the Caribbean basins, but slow velocities also correlate with active volcanic regions along the Central and Eastern cordilleras. In contrast high-speed anomalies are observed along the Pacific coast and Eastern Llanos, perhaps resulting from a thinner crust under those regions. A similar interpretation seems to hold at periods of 34 s for both group and phase velocities, indicating that group velocities are no longer sensitive to shallow sedimentary structure, although slow velocities in the Panamá arc and the Lower Magdalena Basin might still be related to thick sedimentary depositions (recall section 2). Finally, faster phase velocities are observed in the Maracaibo and Caribbean basins, perhaps sensing mantle velocities under a thin
crust. The correlation of slow velocities under the Central Cordillera with active volcanics is, nonetheless, remarkable.
5.	Shear-wave Velocity Models
5.1. Inverting dispersion for S-velocity
From the tomographic maps shown in Figure 10, local dispersion curves can be extracted from each grid point at successive periods ranging between 6 and 38 s, and the resulting phase- and group-velocity dispersion curves can then be jointly inverted to develop S-wave velocity-depth profiles for each grid point. Inversion of group and phase velocities has been performed through the Neighborhood Algorithm (NA) of Sambridge [1999a], as implemented in the software package Dinver (http://www.geopsy.org) of [Wathelet, 2008]. This tecnique has been applied successfully by several authors [e.g. Behr et al., 2010; Kao et al., 2013; Kohler et al., 2015; 2012] to estimate isotropic layered models from dispersion data. The implementation combines computation of dispersion curves (forward problem) through the Dunkin [1965] formulation and an improved version of the original NA. The implementation is based on a powerful geometric sampling with Voronoi cells, which explores the model space in a quasi-random, sequential, and non-uniform manner, taking into account previous estimations of the cost function to generate new and better families of solutions. The misfit function is optimized in a least squares sense (L2-norm) between the dispersion curve predicted by the model and that constructed from the surface-wave maps. The velocity search in the NA is performed by varying 20% the velocity in each layer.
We considered two starting S-velocity models in order to assess the variability of the inversion results. The first starting model is a modified IASP91 model [Kennett and Engdahl, 1991] with Moho depths constrained from crustal thickness estimates developed by Poveda et al. [2015]. The Vp/Vs ratio is constrained to be between 1.60 and 1.85, consistent with typical values of the rocks in the continental crust [Christensen, 1996]; and density is kept to the values from IASP91 with a 10% perturbation. Wathelet et al., [2004] demonstrated that influence of density in the dispersion curve is minimal. The second model is based on a crust of uniform shear wave velocity of 4 km/s with layer thickness of 4 km, with no a priori constraints on crustal thickness. Vp/Vs varies in the same way as for the first model. Finally, the density varies 20% around a starting density of 3.0 g/'em3 for each layer.
The NA search in the model space starts with 100 models, and the 50 best Voronoi cells in the model space are then selected to generate 100 new models during several iterations. The inversion is stopped after 250 iterations, resulting in 25,000 shear velocity models being evaluated at each grid point. From the set of 25,000 models examined during the NA process, we select and average the 500 best-fitting models to obtain a representative model for each grid point. Figure 11 displays inversion examples at three select locations starting from the constrained IASP91 velocity model, where a good fit between observed and predicted dispersion curves can be observed. Optimal misfit values are around 0.06 km/s, with the corresponding best-fitting models being concentrated within a narrow portion of the model space. The select models are located in the Santa Marta massif (Fig. 11a), the Western Cordillera (Fig. 11b), and between the Western and Central cordilleras (Fig. 11c). Tests of depth-resolution for the
dispersion curves are given in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S3), showing that negative, delta-like anomalies interspaced at depths of 10, 20, 30 and 40 km, respectively, are recovered at the right depths for spikes shallower than 40 km. Our S-wave models are thus only reliable for depths down to ~35 km.
The uniqueness of the results is assessed from the similarity of the velocity models developed from the two starting models (constrained IASP91 and unconstrained, uniform crustal velocity). A detailed comparison is provided in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S4), showing histrograms of RMS between the inverted S-velocity models developed from the two starting models that reveal differences are small, especially in the upper crust. Somewhat larger differences begin to appear after 30 km, concluding that the dependence with the starting model is minimal. For interpretation, we will take the results from the IASP91 starting model with crustal thickness constraints. Maps of average misfit distribution between observed and predicted dispersion velocities are given in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S5). The misfit varies between 0.01 and 0.15 km/s, with overall better fits in the Andean Region (misfit &amp;lt;0.06 km/s) than in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts (&amp;lt;0.1 km/s, with local occurrences of 0.1-0.15 km/s).
Finally, to check the robustness of some crustal anomalies - specifically, those under thick sedimentary layers such as the Lower Magdalena Basin - we performed two synthetic tests (Figure S6). The first test consists of a spike test for the 30 s group velocity tomography, concluding that anomalies for this period are well recovered. The second test consists of an inversion of synthetic “data” generated after assuming a 30 km thick crust with a 10 km thick sedimentary layer. This second test demonstrates that, although sedimentary velocities are
smeared into the shallower basement (down to ~15 km depth), they do not pervade the entire crustal column.
5.2.	Models of S-velocity variation
The suite of 1D S-velocity profiles were assembled to build maps of lateral S-velocity variation for depths ranging between 5 and 35 km. Solutions generated from the IASP91 model with Moho depth constraints were selected for the construction of the maps. The minimum curvature interpolation method of Smith and Wessel [1990], with a tension factor of T=0.25, was considered for this purpose. A number of velocity slices are presented in Figure 12 at depth intervals of 5 km. The S-velocity maps show features similar to the dispersion velocity maps, with shallow slices (5-10 km depth) mostly correlating with surface geology and deeper slices (25-35 km depth) mostly correlating with the location of active surface volcanism.
More in detail, at 5 km depth (Figure 12a), we find marked slow S-velocity values on the northwestern side of the Sinu and San Jacinto belts (~2.4 km/s), Maracaibo Basin (~2.7 km/s), the Eastern Cordillera between 4°N-5°N (~2.7 km/s), and the Pacific coastal basin (~2.5 km/s), all of them correlating with the presence of sedimentary rocks (Figure 1). High velocities of ~3.6 km/s characterize the northern Central Cordillera, especially in the Antioqueno Plateau and the Antioqueno Batholith. This region is characterized by the intrusion of Mesozoic quartz diorite batholiths and plutons [Restrepo-Moreno et al., 2009], with metamorphic basement of Paleozoic and Precambrian ages [Case et al., 1971]. Batholiths of Jurassic age [Tschanz et al., 1974; Cardona et al., 2011] present in the northernmost part of Colombia, such as the Santa Marta
massif, also correlate with relatively high velocities (~3.2 km/s). Finally, high-velocity values of ~3.3 km/s are observed in the Eastern Cordillera, Middle Magdalena Valley, and Central cordillera south of ~4°N, correlating with mapped outcrops such as the Garzón Massif, the Quetame Massif, and with Jurassic plutonism under the Central Cordillera.
Similar patterns are observed at 10 km depth (Figure 12b), although some slow-velocity features start to fade away. This is the case of the Panamá arc, where velocity increases from 2.8 km/s to
3.1	km/s at 5 and 10 km, respectively, and the central segment of the Eastern Cordillera, where the velocity estimated is ~3.0 km/s. High velocities of ~3.6 km/s north of the Central Cordillera, nonetheless, remain.
At 20 km depth, low-velocity anomalies (~3.0 km/s) are observed throughout the Caribbean region (SSJB, PB, SJB) and the central segment of the Eastern cordillera (~3.3 km/s). In contrast, the northern segment of the central cordillera, the middle Magdalena Valley and the Santander Massif (EC northernmost flank), and Santa Marta massif display high velocities of ~3.7 km/s with little lateral variation among them. This high-velocity pattern extends further down to 25 and 30 km depth. At 25 km depth under the Pacific coast, South of 4°N, high velocities (&gt; ~4.0 km/s) are also observed. More interestingly, within the same depth-range, low-velocities of ~3.4 km/s are found under the volcanic complexes, especially under the volcanoes near the border with Ecuador and those located between 3°N - 5.4°N (Figure 12d).
At 30 - 35 km depth, we find high velocities (&gt; 4.1 km/s) along the Pacific coast (Tumaco basin, Panama arc), part of the Western Cordillera, Lower Magdalena Basin, and the Llanos Basin,
probably reflecting thin crust. In the Central and Eastern Cordilleras slow velocities around 3.7 km/s dominate the regions, consistent with the presence of a crustal root. Slow velocities (&amp;lt;3.5 km/s) along the southern Central Cordillera still correlate with active volcanic systems located on the surface, and similar slow velocities are also observed in the central part of the Eastern Cordillera, approximately coinciding with the location of inactive volcanism. Slow velocities are also observed at these depths in the southern flank of the Lower Magdalena Basin under the San Jorge Basin. A possible origin for these anomalies is discussed in the next section.
6.	Implications for magmatism and (magmatic) overprint in the upper plate.
The velocity slices described in the previous section show a generally good agreement with previous studies [Meyer et al., 1976; Mooney et al., 1979; Flueh et al., 1981] and, at shallow depths, correlate well with major surface geological features [Gomez et al., 2007a; Veloza et al., 2012]. Our results are directly comparable to those produced by Syracuse et al. [2016]. From the joint inversion of local P- and S-wave arrival times reported by the RSNC, regional surface wave dispersion in the 10-70 s period range, and gravity data from the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 [EGM2008; Pavlis et al., 2012], Syracuse et al. [2016] produced images of lateral P- and S-wave velocity variation down to 155 km depth for the Colombian Andes and adjacent regions. The S-velocity depth-slices at 12.5 km and 32.5 km (see Fig. 6 in Syracuse et al., 2016) are - at long wavelengths - similar to our S-velocity maps at 10 and 35 km depth, respectively (Figs 12b and f), displaying similar patterns of fast and slow S-velocity throughout the area. At shallow crustal depths, for instance, both studies show slow velocities in the Lower Magdalena Basin and the Eastern Llanos, separated by faster velocities in the intervening cordilleras; and, at intermediate
crustal depths, both studies display slow velocities in the Lower Magdalena Basin and under the volcanic areas of the Eastern and Central cordilleras. Due to the inclusion of shorter periods in the development of our velocity models, however, the resulting velocity images have better resolution at short wavelengths. Our images, for instance, clearly depict the fast velocities characterizing the Antioqueno batholith at shallow depths (Fig. 12a,b) and successfully image the shift in volcanism following the trend marked by the Caldas tear at intermediate depths (Fig. 12d,e), which were not resolved by Syracuse et al. [2016].
6.1. Magmatic overprinting
Figures 12a-b show that the signature of sedimentary basins and accretionary wedges can be tracked through slow S-velocities (&amp;lt;3.0 km/s) at shallow depths (5-10 km). In the Lower Magdalena Basin, slow S-velocities are observed along the Sinu-San Jacinto fold belt (SSJB), Plato-San Jorge basin, and Cesar-Rancheria basins, where sediment thickness can reach values of 3-12 km [Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Vernette et al., 1992; Montes et al., 2010; Lara et al., 2013; Sanchez and Mann, 2015]; the Cesar Rancheria basin, however, is not clearly discriminated in the shear wave velocity maps because the dimensions (20-30 km) are lower than the resolution length (~50 km) of the velocity maps. Similarly, the Plato and San Jorge Basins - also characterized by thick sedimentary sequencies - display slow S-velocities. And slow velocities are also found in the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela, where sediment thickness varies between 3 - 9 km [Mann et al., 2006]. Slow velocities (2.8-3.0 km/s) are also observed under the central flank of the Eastern Cordillera (4°N to 6.5°N, figure 12a,b), which is considered a fold and thrust belt with Cretaceous sedimentary cover units [Mora and Parra, 2008; Horton et al., 2015], and
the neighbouring Middle Magdalena Valley, which is covered by Quaternary-Neogene sedimentary rocks [Mora et al., 2006; Parra et al., 2009]. These anomalies do not show continuity at larger depths, as sedimentary basins are shallow features that are confined within the shallow crust.
Some shallow, high-velocity anomalies also lack continuity at depth. High velocities are, for instance, observed in the Ibague Batholit and paralleling the volcanic line under the Central Cordillera; however, these anomalies are replaced by low-velocity anomalies at larger depths of 20-35 km (Figs 12c-f). As argued in the next section, we believe that velocity anomalies below those depths are dominated by the signature of subduction-related volcanism, implying that the geological formations observed at surface levels, which attest to the accretionary and deformational history of the northeastern Andean region, are being overprinted at depth by younger magmatism.
In contrast, some high-velocity anomalies do have continuity at depth. High velocities are observed in the Santa Marta Massif and Santander Massif (SM) down to ~30 km depth (Figs 12a-e), reflecting the presence of an outcropping crystalline basement, Jurassic Plutonism, and Precambrian metamorphic rocks [Cardona et al., 2011]; and fast velocities are also observed along the Central Cordillera, which can be traced down to 35 km depth north of 5oN latitude and extending laterally into the Middle Magdalena Valley (Figs 12a-f). According to Montes et al. [2005], this whole region represents a unique crustal block with a more rigid behavior and less deformation than the surrounding Eastern Cordillera, consistent with persistently fast velocities.
This would conversely attest to the lack of magmatic overprinting in these areas due to the absence of volcanic activity in this region. Magmatic overprinting at depth of surface geological features in the Colombian Andes seems thus to be dictated by the geometry and segmentation of the subducting Nazca and Caribbean slabs.
6.2.	Subduction-related volcanism
Active volcanism in Colombia is presently found along the Central Cordillera, south of ~5oN latitude (Fig. 1), and has been related to the subduction of the Nazca Plate along the Pacific margin of South America. This volcanism is generally described as mainly explosive in character and andesitic in composition [e.g. Marin-Ceron et al., 2010]. The strong correlation between slow S-velocities at intermediate depths (25-35 km) and surface volcanism in the CC, makes us think that those velocities are related to magma production along the subduction front. The magmatic evolution of the Colombian Andes was investigated in Weber et al. [2002] from the analysis of deep crustal xenolith suites. They proposed a model for the deep Andean crust in which basaltic components (e.g. oceanic plateau) and minor sediment are incorporated into the subduction-accretion complex, with areas of possible melt formation within the mantle wedge, mantle-crust transition, and accreted lower crust. Considering that our observed S-velocities display a similar S-velocity range of 3.4-3.6 km/s within the entire 25-35 km depth-range, which exclude a purely thermal origin, and that the xenolith suite does not display evidence of pervasive crustal melting [Weber et al., 2002], we conclude that the observed slow S-velocities likely correspond to subduction-related magmas ponding at mid-crustal depths.
More enigmatic is the presence of even slower S-velocities (3.2-3.6 km/s) in the same depthrange under the inactive volcanoes of the Eastern Cordillera (Fig. 12d-f). Volcanism in the EC is concentrated in the Paipa-Iza volcanic complex, which is believed to have formed during the late Pliocene when the Cordillera reached its present elevation [Pardo et al., 2005]. Recent thermo and geochronological constraints on the eruption history of this complex developed from zircon fission-track analysis and U-Pb data have bracketed the time of this volcanic activity between 5.9 Ma and (at least) 1.8 Ma [Bernet et al., 2016]. Interestingly, the study argues that hydrothermal activity, with water temperatures up to 73oC, CO2 gas seepages associated with regional faults, and a strong local geothermal gradient of 74 oC/km, support the existence of a magma chamber at shallow depths. If this inference were correct, an interpretation of the observed slow S-velocities under the volcanic complex as deriving from partial melts - similar to the interpretation under the active volcanism of the Central Cordillera - would be plausible. Indeed, bulk Vp/Vs ratios in the area are high, around 1.82-1.86 [Poveda et al., 2015], as well as Lg attenuation [Ojeda and Ottemoller, 2002], consistent with the presence of partial melts in the crust. Our results therefore support Bernet et al. [2016]’s conclusion that volcanism under the EC might be inactive but not necessarily extinct. Moreover, magmatic activity in the region might help explain the non-isostatic residual topography of the region reported by [Yarce et al., 2014], as the thermally perturbed asthenospheric wedge expected in the region [Chiarabba et al., 2016] might provide the necessary buoyancy to explain the elevations.
Alternatively, low-velocities may also be an indication of aligned anisotropic minerals. High Vp/Vs ratios might be related to high pore fluid pressure and crack anisotropy [Wang et al., 2012], and recent local S-splitting estimations [Idarraga-Garcia et al., 2016] display high
anisotropy values of 3.09% and 3.43% for the EC crust. Moreover, it is well known that the EC is a deformed NE-trending fold-and-thrust belt, and several authors have documented the crustal shortening, thickening and uplift that occurred in this region [Colletta et al., 1990; Dengo and Covey, 1993; Cortes et al., 2006; Mora et al., 2010] during late Miocene [Taboada et al., 2000; Egbue et al., 2014]. The detachment surface depth under EC fold-and-thrust belt is postulated to be between 20 and 30 km depth [Mora and Parra, 2008], which correlates well with the termination of slow S-velocities at depth (Figure 12).
Even more enigmatic is the presence of similarly slow S-velocities under the Lower Magdalena Basin, where slower-than-average S-velocities are found for almost the entire depth-range (Fig. 12a-e). S-velocities are 2.4-2.8 km/s down to ~10 km depth, which have been found consistent with the accretionary prism reported earlier (section 6.1); S-velocities of 3.0-3.4 km/s at 20-30 km, however, are harder to explain. To help clarify this issue, a NW-SE trending cross-section crossing the LMB and EC regions is displayed in Figure 13a. The figure shows that the Caribbean region, like the Eastern Cordillera, consists of a shallow layer of slow (2.4-2.8 km/s) S-velocities overlying an also slow (3.0-3.4 km/s) upper-middle crust. Moreover, also like the EC, bulk Vp/Vs ratios in the Caribbean region are in the 1.82-1.86 range [Poveda et al., 2015], which would again be consistent the presence of partial melts. Strikingly, this region is regarded as amagmatic.
We argue, nonetheless, that partial melts might be present within the Lower Magdalena basin. A recent study of field, geochemical, gechronological, biostratigraphical, and sedimentary provenance of basaltic and associated sediments in northern Colombia has revealed the existence
of Middle Miocene (13-14 Ma) mafic volcanism within the Caribbean continental margin [Lara et al., 2013]. In particular, geochemical analysis showed that basalts were formed by asthenospheric melting at shallow depths mixed with some additional slab input and, together with biostratigraphic results, demonstrated that they were deposited in a platform setting. Considering the low-angle subduction of the Caribbean plate and the corresponding absence of a mantle wedge (recall section 2.1), the authors proposed the presence of a vertical tear in the subducting plate through which asthenospheric melts would have found their way through while acquiring the observed slab input. Vertical tears might result from along-strike extension related to the strong curvature of the subduction as it passes around the NW corner of South America, and this type of extension was invoked in Bernal-Olaya et al. [2015a] to explain the origin of the Plato and San Jorge basins within the Lower Magdalena Basin. Assuming a speed of 20 mm/yr for the Caribbean plate relative to the South American plate, and a position of the tear under the continental platform at 13-14 Ma, it is easy to calculate that the tear would be presently located 260-280 km further inland under the South American plate. This distance-range is consistent with the location of the Caribbean low S-velocity region (Fig. 12c-e), suggesting that the Caribbean slab might have been breached by asthenospheric melts that are now ponding at mid-crustal depths within the overriding plate.
As stated before (recall section 5.1 and Figure S6), we are confident that the mid-crustal, low-velocity anomaly under the Lower Magdalena Basin is not an artifact from the inversion procedure. Moreover, the trace of the Romeral Suture - which is regarded as a major fault separating the oceanic crustal rocks of the Western Cordillera from the continental-affinity basement to the East [Restrepo and Toussaint, 1988; Taboada et al., 2000; Cediel et al., 2003] -
is very consistent with the velocity contrast separating the Central Cordillera from the sedimentary units described above at shallow depths (Figs 12a-b), suggesting a continuation of this fault into the Lower Magdalena Basin (Fig. 12a) [Taboada et al., 2000; Toro et al., 2004; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b]. This consistency degrades at larger depths (Figs 12d-f), suggesting that the low-velocity anomaly under the Lower Magdalena Basin at mid-crustal depths is not related to sedimentary structure.
However, we do acknowledge that the large lateral extent of the anomaly is at odds with the lack of surface volcanism associated with it, and that alternative mechanisms might be at play. Low velocity zones may also be related to fluid migration along major faults zones, especially when coincident with large Vp/Vs ratios [Zhao et al., 1996; Thurber et al., 2003]. Such relationships have been recently invoked, for instance, to explain large Vp/Vs ratios within the western Hispaniola crust [Corbeau et al., 2017] and, perhaps more importantly, to explain low velocity anomalies along the Sinu and Romeral Fault system [Bernal-Olaya et al, 2015c]. In the case of the Lower Magdalena Basin anomaly, the Romeral fault system - which, as described above, might actually be extending under the basin - could provide the paths for fluids emanating from the subducting Caribbean plate to infiltrate the surrounding continental mantle and reach mid-crustal depths. Fluid migration along the Romeral fault system would then explain both the low velocities reported in this study, as well as high bulk Vp/Vs ratios reported in the receiver function study of Poveda et al, [2015]. Moreover, fluid expulsion might also provide an alternative explanation for the mid-crustal, low-velocity anomaly under the Eastern Cordillera, as Bernal-Olaya et al. [2015c] have related low-velocities at depths &gt; 80 km near the Bucaramanga earthquake nest with such phenomenon.
Finally, we note that our velocity slices cleary image the signature of the "Caldas tear" postulated by Vargas and Mann [2013] at crustal depths within the overriding plate. As mentioned in section 2, the “Caldas tear” is an E-W trending feature that extends for ~240 km and separates two slab segments that subduct at different angles. The projection of the Caldas tear is superimposed in our S-velocity model (Figure 12d and 12e), showing it can be traced down to 20-35 km depth.
7.	Conclusions
We have presented the first ambient noise tomography of the Colombian Andes and surrounding regions from recordings of 53 broadband seismic stations belonging to the Red Sismológica Nacional de Colombia (RSNC). A total of 1300 empirical Green’s functions - identified as fundamental-mode, Rayleigh waves - were recovered, covering much of the country and furnishing new constraints in areas where previous information was limited. Our results resolve geological features with high accuracy at shallow levels, as well as patterns associated with magmatism and plate segmentation at mid-crustal depths. More specifically, slow S velocities under the Central Cordillera have been attributed to accumulation of magmas in the middle crust generated in the underlying mantle wedge, and evidence of magmatic activity has been reported under the inactive volcanoes of the Eastern Cordillera. Slow S-velocities in the Caribbean middle crust have been related to asthenospheric melts that would have breached the Caribbean flat slab through a vertical tear. Alternatively, migration of fluids along faults from expulsion of nearby subducting slabs could provide a feasible explanation for such velocity anomalies.

Investigating Active and Inactive Volcanism under the Colombian Andes with Radial Anisotropy (Paper II)
The following manuscript, entitled Investigating Active and Inactive Volcanism under the Colombian Andes with Radial Anisotropy from Ambient Noise and Surface Wave Tomography, presents results on radial anisotropy for the Colombian Andes, inferred from the discrepancy between vertically (VSV) and transverselly (VSH) polarized S-velocities. A total of 1,264 empirical Green’s functions were developed from ambient noise cross-correlations, and long-period (40 - 150 s) group velocities were determined from 11,000 fundamental-mode, surface-wave trains from earthquake sources at regional and teleseismic distances. The most important findings are related to regions of active and inactive volcanism, where negative/positive radial anisotropy in the upper-middle crust is observed, respectively, consistent with the presence/absence of feeding dykes. The manuscript also reports on positive radial anisotropy found at all crustal levels under the Lower Magdalena Valley, which is attributed to a combination of SPO (Shape Preferred Orientation) mechanisms including thick sedimentary sequences of alternating velocity, extensional stresses, and storage of asthenospheric magmas that breached the Caribbean flat slab. Additionally, it is argued that observed negative radial anisotropy in the Caribbean upper mantle might be characterizing the lateral extent of the Caribbean flat slab. This manuscript was submitted for publication in Tectonophysics on 02 AUG 2018.

Key Points:
•	Regions of active and inactive volcanism are underlain by negative and positive
radial anisotropy, respectively, at upper- and mid-crustal depths.
•	Positive radial anisotropy pervades the Colombian lower crust, suggesting
widespread accumulation of subduction-related melts.
•	Radial anisotropy in the upper mantle is generally small and can be disregarded.
•	Negative radial anisotropy characterizes flat subduction under the Caribbean
region at lithospheric depths.
Abstract
The relationship between crustal fluids and active/inactive volcanism under the
Colombian Andes is investigated by mapping seismic radial anisotropy at crustal and
upper mantle levels. Radial anisotropy is inferred from the discrepancy between
vertically (VSV) and transverselly (VSH) polarized S-velocities in horizontally propagating Rayleigh and Love waves, respectively. First, short-period (8 - 38 s) phase and group velocities are estimated from 1,264 empirical Green's functions from ambient noise cross-correlations, and long-period (40 - 150 s) group velocities are determined from 11,000 fundamental-mode, surface-wave trains from earthquake sources at regional and teleseismic epicentral distances. Dispersion velocities are then tomographically inverted to develop maps of phase and group velocity variation for periods between 8 and 38 s and 8 and 150 s, respectively. Finally, VSV and VSH velocity-depth profiles are constructed from the joint inversion of local group and phase velocity dispersion curves at each node in the tomographic grid down to 140 km depth. Our results reveal complex patterns of positive (VSH &gt; VSV) and negative (VSH &amp;lt;VSV) radial anisotropy at both crustal and upper mantle depths. At upper to mid crustal levels radial anisotropy displays values of ±20%, with negative anisotropy coinciding with major tectonic terrains (Santa Marta Massif, Antioquia Batholith) and regions of active volcanism, and positive anisotropy characterizing major coastal basins (Lower Magdalena Basin, Tumaco Basin) and regions of inactive volcanism. Negative anisotropy under active volcanic regions is consistent with the presence of sub-vertical magmatic dykes feeding the volcanics, while positive anisotropy under inactive volcanic regions is consistent with magma storage along flat-lying sills. In tectonic terrains, negative anisotropy may be explained through escape tectonics, while positive anisotropy under the coastal basins could be resulting from a combination of flay-lying magmatic sills, extensional tectonics, and/or sub-horizontal shear. In the lower crust, positive anisotropy (up to 15%) is pervasive and interpreted as storage of subduction-related magmas, perhaps feeding
the dykes and sills at shallower crustal depths. Radial anisotropy in the upper mantle is generally small (&amp;lt;2%), except in the Caribbean region where negative anisotropy up to 4% coincides with the postulated location of the Caribbean flat slab.
1.	Introduction
The tectonic complexity of the northwestern Andes has been demonstrated through a number of geological and geophysical studies (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015a; Chiarabba et al., 2016; Corredor, 2003; Cortés and Angelier, 2005; Idárraga-García et al., 2016; Pennington, 1981; Syracuse et al., 2016; Taboada et al., 2000; van der Hilst and Mann, 1994; Vargas and Mann, 2013; Wagner et al., 2017a; Yarce et al., 2014). Those studies demonstrate that the geometry of the Nazca and Caribbean plates is characterized by the presence of two Wadati-Benioff zones displaced by ~250 km at about 5.5°N and form a slab window. The first Benioff zone is located south of 5.5°N and displays a well-defined, N-S trending line of active volcanoes. The second Benioff zone is located between latitudes 5.5°N and 9°N and, interestingly, has no active volcanism associated with it (see Fig. 1).
The geometry of the Nazca plate under NW South America can be divided into two segments, based on the angle of subduction from focal mechanisms and seismicity Pedraza-Garcia et al. (2007): a segment between 0°N and 3°N, with an angle that varies between 28° and 30°, and a second segment with an angle of 45° between 3°N and 5.5°N. The belt of associated volcanic activity is also segmented, with a volcanic gap between 2.92°N to 4.48°N possibly associated with the variation in the slab angle along the plate. South of the volcanic gap, volcanism is dominantly andesitic, with small
volumes of dacites and rhyolites and little explosive potential (e.g. Galeras Volcanic Complex). North of the volcanic gap (between ~4.5°N to ~5.5°N), several volcanic complexes are found (e.g. Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, Cerro Bravo volcano and Cerro Machín volcano), which are considered the most active and dangerous volcanoes in NW South America (Londoño and Sudo, 2003). The composition of these volcanoes ranges from basaltic andesites to dacites (Londoño and Sudo, 2003; Vatin-Pérignon et al., 1990). Recent studies (Londoño, 2016; Murcia et al., 2018) agree that the plumbing system under this volcanic segment is associated with vertical ducts in the shallow crust (between 5 - 20 km depth), fed by a common reservoir between 20 and 30 km depth under the entire volcanic segment. Lundgren et al. (2015), on the other hand, from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, propose that the magma ascent is associated with dike-generated conduits and lenses of magma stored at ~14 km depth.
The geometry of the Caribbean plate has not been accurately delineated, although several authors agree with very shallow subduction and oblique convergence of this plate below NW South America (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b; Mora-Bohórquez et al., 2017; Sanchez-Rojas and Palma, 2014; Sanchez and Mann, 2015; Taboada et al., 2000; van der Hilst and Mann, 1994). The shallow subduction angles postulated for this plate (5 - 10o) have been invoked to explain the paucity of active surface volcanism in the overriding South American plate (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015a; Mora-Bohórquez et al., 2017).
The presence of subduction-related melts within the overriding plate has been recently investigated in Poveda et al. (2018). In that study detailed velocity variations for
the Colombian Andes were recovered from ambient noise tomography (ANT) and inversion of Rayleigh-wave dispersion velocities. Low velocity values were reported in the upper crust coincident with sedimentary basins and quaternary deposits, such as the Sinu and San Jacinto belts (~2.4 km/s), the Maracaibo Basin (~2.7 km/s), and the Eastern Cordillera (EC) between 4°N and 5°N (~2.7 km/s), and along the Pacific coastal margins (~2.5 km/s). High velocity values were observed along the Central Cordillera (CC), coinciding with igneo-metamorphic rocks and batholits (eg., Ibague and Antioqua Batholiths). At mid-crustal levels (25-30 km) slow velocities were identified right under regions of active and inactive volcanism along the Central and Eastern Cordilleras, respectively, from which the presence of subduction-related melts were inferred. Why surface volcanism under the EC is inactive, however, remained unanswered. Even more intriguingly, similar slow velocities were reported under the Lower Magdalena Basin (LMB), right above the subducting Caribbean flat slab. The presence of Middle Miocene (13-14 Ma) mafic volcanism in the Caribbean continental margin, which might have reached the surface through a vertical tear in the Caribbean flat slab (Lara et al.,
2013), let Poveda et al. (2018) propose that the slow velocities might reflect the presence of melts that breached the Caribbean slab and are now ponding at mid-crustal depths within the South American plate. Poveda et al. (2018), however, also acknowledged that those slow velocities could alternatively be related to fluid migration along major crustal faults (Corbeau et al., 2017) located under LMB (e.g. Romeral and Sinu faults).
Seismic anisotropy offers an excellent tool for investigating the stress and shear strain history associated with past deformation, magmatism and flow patterns resulting
from tectonic processes (e.g., Moschetti et al., 2010a, 2010b). Traditionally, seismic anisotropy studies had utilized SKS phases from earthquake sources [e.g. Porritt et al., 2014; Bastow et al., 2015; Idarraga-Garcia et al., 2016] to infer orientation of fossil anisotropic fabrics in the lithosphere and/or flow patterns in the sublithospheric mantle; most recently, radial anisotropy has been considered for inferring patterns of fluid flow and/or direction of ductile deformation in the crust through the discrepancy between VSV and VSH velocities in Rayleigh and Love waves, respectively (Das and Rai, 2017; Lynner et al., 2018; Spica et al., 2017; Yudistira et al., 2017). Radially anisotropic media (or, equivalently, transversely isotropic media) are defined through a vertical symmetry axis [e.g Xie et al., 2013], so that horizontally propagating waves travel at different wavespeeds depending on their vertical (VSV) or horizontal (VSH) sense of polarization. Radial anisotropy has been utilized to investigate crustal and/or mantle deformation on regional and global scales (Lynner et al., 2018; Moschetti et al., 2010b; Yudistira et al., 2017), as well as fluid flow in volcanic systems (Mordret et al., 2014; Spica et al., 2017). Radial anisotropy can be classified as positive (VSV &gt; VSH), or negative (VSH &amp;lt;VSV), depending on which velocity is dominating.
Radial anisotropy can originate from either crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) or shape preferred orientation (SPO). CPO is associated with alignment of the crystallographic axes of elastically anisotropic minerals, while SPO is related to structural controls exerted by geologic structures, such as sedimentary layering, magmatic intrusions, dykes, sills, melt lenses and partial melting (Babuska and Cara, 1991; Crampin, 1986, 1981; Leary et al., 1990; Shapiro, 2004). In the upper crust, the most important type of deformation for radial anisotropy is SPO (Karato, 2008). Positive
radial anisotropy is related to horizontal layering and/or aligned cracks and structures, such as horizontal bedding in sediments, fabric alignment created by extension and/or magma storage in flat-lying sills; negative radial anisotropy is attributed to vertically aligned structures such as vertical shear zones, high fault density in sedimentary sequences and/or dyke systems (Karato, 2008; Spica et al., 2017). Nevertheless, biotite and horblende can cause CPO anistropy in the crust. In the lower crust, plastic deformation is generally related to CPO of anisotropic minerals, such as amphibole and mica, during deformation along sub-horizontal shear zones at the upper-lower crust and the lower crust-lithospheric mantle boundaries (Gerbault and Willingshofer, 2004). In the upper mantle, horizontal, large-scale asthenospheric flow in the presence of strong anisotropic minerals, such as olivine or orthopyroxenes has been related to CPO, as well (Karato, 2008).
In this work, we compute transverse ambient seismic noise cross-correlations between all possible pairs of permanent stations in NW South America to extract empirical Green's functions for inter-station Love waves in the region, and develop maps of phase and group velocity variation between 8 and 26 s. The resulting ambient noise tomography (ANT) maps are then combined with those developed in Poveda et al. (2018) for Rayleigh waves to map radial anisotropy with depth through the LoveRayleigh wave discrepancy (Lynner et al., 2018; Moschetti et al., 2010b; Spica et al., 2017). Moreover, group-velocity maps in the 40 to 150 s period range are additionally constructed through surface wave tomography (SWT) of Love and Rayleigh wave from regional and teleseismic earthquake sources, and combined with the shorter-period ANT results to develop joint VSV and VSH velocity models at crustal and upper mantle
depths (down to 140 km). In the upper crust, our results reveal positive anisotropy coinciding with the thick, sub-horizontal Quaternary sequences that fill the main sedimentary basins, and negative anisotropy under active surface volcanoes in igneous-metamorphic terrains. In the middle crust, negative anisotropy is again observed under active volcanic complexes, while positive anisotropy is found under inactive volcanoes, suggesting storage of subduction-related melts along vertically oriented (feeding) dykes and flat-lying sills, respectively. In the lower crust, positive anisotropy is pervasive throughout the study area. In the upper mantle negative radial anisotropy is generally small, but moderate negative anisotropy characterizes the lithospheric mantle under the LMB, perhaps delineating the area of Caribbean flat subduction.
2.	Ambient noise and surface-wave tomography
2.1.	Short-period dispersion velocities
The dataset utilized to develop short-period dispersion measurements consisted of continuous recordings of ambient seismic noise at up to 47 seismic stations operated by the Colombian Geological Survey and 3 nearby Global Seismograph Network stations in Ecuador, Venezuela, and Panamá. Recording time windows from January 2015 to December 2016 were considered. The combined seismic network consisted of a variety of seismic sensors and digitizers, which included Streckeisen STS-2, Streckeisen STS-2.5, Güralp CMG-3T, Güralp CMG3-ESP, Trillium 120p, Reftek 151A-120, and Reftek 151B-120 broadband and very broadband sensors, all with flat response in velocity down to 120 s, and high-gain digitizers (Quanterra Q330, Güralp
DM24 and Taurus) sampling continuously at 100 samples per second. The geographic distribution of the seismic stations is depicted in Figure 1.
Empirical Green's functions (EGFs) containing the Love wave train between all station pairs were obtained from the cross-correlation of up to two years (January 2015 - December 2016) of continuous data. We adopted the same procedure that Poveda et al. (2018) utilized to develop Rayleigh wave EGFs from the same dataset, which was based on the well-established approaches of Bensen et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2008). At each station, data were first resampled to 1 sample per second and split into one-day segments, to then be demeaned, detrended, and have the instrument response removed. The resulting one day-long segments were next band-pass filtered between 0.01 and 0.2 Hz, and normalized in the time (one-bit) and frequency (spectral whitening) domains. The horizontal components (N, E) were then rotated into the great-circle-path according to interstation orientations to produce the radial (R) and transverse (T) components, and cross-correlated to develop radial-radial (RR) and transverse-transverse (TT) cross-correlations. Finally, the RR and TT cross-correlations were stacked through the time-frequency, phase-weighted procedure (tf-PWS) of Schimmel and Paulssen (1997) and Schimmel et al. (2011) to develop the EGFs. In total, 1264 Rayleigh (RR) and Love (TT) EGFs were obtained from the assembled data set (see Figure 2).
Phase and group velocity dispersion was measured in the Love-wave (TT) EGFs only, using the Automated Frequency-Time Analysis (AFTAN) of Levshin and Ritzwoller (2001), as Rayleigh-wave dispersion was already measured in the ZZ component by Poveda et al. (2018). Phase and group velocities were obtained for periods between 8
to 26 s for EGFs with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &gt; 7, and dispersion measurements with inter-station distances smaller than 3 wavelengths were eliminated (Bensen et al.,
2007). The intrinsic 2nN phase ambiguity of phase-velocity measurements was resolved using the global phase velocity reference model from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) of Dziewonski and Anderson (1981). Additional details about data processing and measurement of dispersion velocities can be found in Poveda et al. (2018), along with Rayleigh-wave EGFs and dispersion measurements from ZZ (vertical-vertical) cross-correlations.
2.2.	Long-period dispersion velocities
The dataset utilized to develop dispersion measurements at longer periods, consisted of local, regional and telesseismic waveforms recorded between 1994 and 2016 by 50 seismic stations operated by the National Seismological Network of Colombia (RSNC), and 9 additional Global Seismological Network (GSN) stations in Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, Brazil and the Caribbean region. The time windows considered for each station and their geographical locations are listed in Table 1, and the location of the stations and earthquake sources are displayed in Figure 3. Hypocentral information was obtained from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) for distant and regional events, and from the RSNC catalogue for local events. In total, we selected 430 local (&amp;lt;1000 km), 270 regional (1000 - 2000 km) and 420 teleseismic (&gt; 2000 km) earthquake sources with magnitudes larger than 4.5 and depths less than 30 km (see Figure S1, in the Supplemmentary Materials, for further details).
To develop dispersion measurements, the instrumental response was first removed from the recorded waveforms, which were then converted to displacement, demeaned, detrended and re-sampled to one sample per second. Fundamental-mode, group-velocities for Rayleigh and Love waves were then measured through the Multiple Filter Analysis of Dziewonski et al. (1969), as implemented in the PGSWMFA package (PGplot Surface Wave Multiple Filter Analysis) of Ammon (1998) , after isolating the fundamental mode through a phase-match filter (Herrin and Goforth, 1977). Rayleighwave dispersion was obtained from the vertical components, while Love-wave dispersion was measured on the rotated, transverse components. In total, over 11,000 wavetrains were analyzed, resulting in over 10,000 dispersion curves for Rayleigh wave and over 7,000 for Love waves. A detailed example of waveform processing for periods between 30 and 150 s is given in the Supplemmentary Materials (Figure S2). Dispersion measurements were obtained in a wide period range (10 - 150 s), although the range of periods for a given waveform varied according to waveform complexity, epicentral distance, and event magnitude.
A rigorous quality control was applied to the measured dispersion velocities to ensure that only high-quality group velocities were used in the tomographic inversion. First, in order to identify possible timing problems in the seismograms, P-wave travel times were computed with the TauP software of Crotwell et al. (1999) and compared to those picked from the waveforms. Those that did not agree within 5 s were rejected. Second, only group velocity estimates that formed continuous dispersion curves were considered, discarding measurements with abrupt jumps and/or gaps in the dispersion curve. Finally, as for the EGFs above, dispersion measurements with inter-station
distances smaller than 3 wavelengths were eliminated (Bensen et al., 2007). The final number of raypaths as a function of distance and period are displayed in Figure 4. Note that for periods between 20 and 60 s the number of measurement is larger than 8000 and 5000 for Rayleigh and Love waves, respectively; between 60 and 130 s, the number of raypaths gradually decreases from 8000 to 2000 for Rayleigh waves, and from 6000 to 1500 for Love waves (Figure 4a). The average distance travelled is similar for Rayleigh and Love waves (Figure 4c). Histograms for 50 s Rayleigh and Love wave raypaths reveal the most common distance is 10 degrees (Figs 4b,d).
2.3.	Tomographic inversion
For the tomographic inversion, we used dispersion data between 8 to 26 s from EGFs (phase and group, Love) and 30 to 150 s from earthquake data (group only, Rayleigh and Love). Group velocities for periods below 30 s from earthquake sources were not considered, as they were found of lower quality when compared to those obtained from the ANT at similar periods, and no corresponding phase velocity estimates were developed. The FMST (Fast Marching Surface-wave Tomography) procedure of Rawlinson and Sambridge (2005) was utilized for either ambient noise or surface-wave dispersion measurements. The FMST solves the forward problem through the Eikonal equation, which allows for the description of the entire wavefront in time and space (Sethian and Popovici, 1999). The inverse problem was approached through an iterative, non-linear scheme driven by the subspace method, which minimizes the RMS misfit between observed and predicted dispersion velocities with damping and smoothness regularizations. Further details can be found in Rawlinson and Sambridge (2004, 2005).
For the tomographic inversion of ambient noise (Love waves, 8 - 26 s) and surface-wave dispersion velocities (Rayleigh and Love waves, 30 - 150 s), the study area was divided into cells of 0.5o x 0.5o and 1.0o x 1.0o, respectively. An average velocity was determined from all the observations at a given period, which was then utilized as both the starting model and for damping regularization. The regularization parameters in the objective function were estimated through the L-curve (Aster et al., 2013), after exploring a wide variety of smoothness and damping values. Figure S3, in the Supplemmentary Materials, displays the L-curves for 26 and 110 s for Love wave. The regularization parameters ranged between 1 to 300 for smoothness and roughness, for all periods. Convergence was generally achieved after 6 iterations.
Tomographic images for Rayleigh and Love group velocities at 10, 50, and 100 s are displayed in Figure 5; similar images for Rayleigh and Love phase velocities can be found in Figure S4, along with checkerboard resolution tests (Figure S5). Recall that the ANT tomographic images for Rayleigh waves (phase and group) were borrowed from Poveda et al. (2018). As already noticed in that study, Rayleigh-wave group velocities at short periods (10 s) display a pattern of fast and slow dispersion that correlates well with surface geology: low velocity anomalies are found under coastal and intracontinental basins (LMB, MMV, EC), while fast velocities correlate with igneous-metamorphic complexes (SMM, AB, IB) and along the southern segment of the EC (which encompasses the Garzon Massif). At 50 s, Rayleigh-wave dispersion shows an inverse correlation with crustal thickness, with high velocities in regions of thin crust and low velocities in regions of thick crust. The Andean zone, where crustal thickness is larger than 50 km (Poveda et al., 2015), is characterized by slow velocities, while fast
velocities characterize the Guiana craton, the Santa Marta Massif and the Maracaibo Block, where the crustal thickness is small (&amp;lt;40 km). Finally, at long periods (100 s), low velocities are related to the asthenospheric mantle wedge above the subducting Nazca plate, while fast velocities are possibly associated with flat subduction of the Caribbean plate (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b; Mora-Bohórquez et al., 2017) and the presence of thick lithosphere under the EC.
Tomographic images for Love-wave dispersion display similar patterns, although the match to the corresponding Rayleigh-wave images is not perfect (Figure 5). At short periods the sedimentary basins (LMB, MMV, EC) still display slow velocities; however, velocities under the CC and SMM are not fast, but slow. At 50 s, Love and Rayleigh wave velocities are almost identical, probably reflecting the same variations in crustal thickness; yet, small discrepancies are still observed. At long periods (100 s) the transition from slow to fast velocity is shifted East with respect to that observed in the Rayleigh wave images at the same period. The reported discrepancies in the velocity patterns are due, in part, to the different depth-sensitivity of Rayleigh and Love waves at similar periods (e.g. Lay and Wallace, 1995); as demonstrated in the next section, the observed discrepancies also result from radial anisotropy.
3.	Radial anisotropy patterns
3.1.	Inversion for VSV and VSH
The tomographic dispersion estimates described in the previous section were next combined to build dispersion curves at each node making the 0.5o x 0.5o grid utilized in the ANT. Local dispersion curves (phase and group) for Rayleigh-waves were
constructed by combining the ambient noise tomography results of Poveda et al. (2018) between 7 to 38 s with group velocities developed in this work from earthquake sources between 40 and 150 s. Local dispersion curves were similarly built for Love waves by combining the Love-wave dispersion velocity estimates from ANT and from earthquake sources developed in this study. SV and SH velocity-depth profiles were then developed obtained from the joint inversion of Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion. Following Lynner et al. (2018), Rayleigh and Love-wave dispersion velocities were inverted separately.
To develop the 1D velocity-depth profiles we followed the linearized, iterative inversion scheme described in Julia et al. (2003), in which the RMS misfit between observed and predicted dispersion velocities is minimized in a least-squares sense, with smoothness constraints. The method was originally developed for the joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion measurements, but can be easily applied to the inversion of dispersion curves by giving zero influence to the receiver function portion of the objective function. Smoothness is controlled through the a priorily defined smoothness parameter (0), which is determined through analysis of the trade-off curve between RMS misfit and model roughness for each inversion (see e.g. Ammon et al., 1990). The number of iterations was determined through inspection of the RMS misfit with iteration number.
The starting model was parametrized with a crust consisting of a S-velocity gradient from 3.3 to 4.0 km/s, using 2.5 km-thick layers that extended down to the local Moho depth reported in Poveda et al. (2018). In the upper mantle, we used S-velocity values from the PREM global velocity model (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981),
parametrized in 5.0 km thick layers for depths between 70 and 150 km, and 10 km thick below 150 km depth. The crustal Vp/Vs ratio was set to the value reported by Ojeda and Havskov (2001) of 1.78 for NW South America, while densities were estimated from Vp through the well-established empirical relationship of Berteussen (1977).
A detailed example of the linearized dispersion curve inversion for VSV and VSH velocity is presented in Figure 6 for a node at 5.5°N, 73°W under the EC. The inversion results shows a fast VSH with respect to VSV for the middle crust, resulting in a marked peak of positive radial anisotropy (Vsh &gt; Vsv) of 20% at 39 km depth. Figure 6 also shows a good match between observed and predicted Rayleigh and Love waves for both group and phase velocity. As shown in the Supplemmentary Materials (Figure S6), Rayleigh and Love dispersion curves could not be simultaneously matched using a single S-velocity model.
3.2.	Radially anisotropic S-velocity structure
Radial anisotropy was inferred from the inverted VSV and VSH velocity models by first estimating isotropic S-velocity through the Voigt average
Voigt average = J(2Vs"3	(1)
and then computing the percentage of radial anisotropy as
Radial anisotropy = !Vsh Vsv" x 100%	(2)
OZS" + !SV)
(see e.g. Lynner et al., 2018). Figures 7 and 8 display the Voigt average and radial anisotropy percentage obtained from inverted VSV and VSH velocities for select depths
between 10 and 140 km. As expected (recall eq. 2), the variations in Voigt average are similar to those reported in Poveda et al. (2018) for VSV where there is depth overlap.
More in detail, at 10 km depth fast velocities (3.4 km/s) and negative values of radial anisotropy are observed coinciding with igneous-metamorphic terrains along the AB (20%), the SMM (5%) and, perhaps, the SM (2%). South of the EC, under the Garzon massif (GM), negative radial anisotropy is observed with a value of 5% and a Voigt average of 3.3 km/s. Slow velocities and positive radial anisotropy patterns, on the other hand, are observed at the LMB (2.8 km/s - 12%), under the EC north of 4°N (2.9 km/s - 3%), at the SSJB (2.9 km/s - 5 %), and at the TB (2.8 km/s - 10%). At 25 km depth, slow velocities and positive radial anisotropy are observed under the LMB, with values about of 3.3 km/s and 20%, respectively. Fast velocities and negative radial anisotropy are observed under the CC (north of 5.5°N), the MMV and the SM, with values of 3.8-3.9 km/s and 5-10%, respectively. Below the CC (south of 5°N), the WC and the TB, on the other hand, slightly slow velocities and positive radial anisotropy (3.4 km/s - 5%) are found. Note that active volcanism is found along the CC south of latitude 5°N. Positive radial anisotropy (6%) and slow velocities (3.5 km/s) characterize the EC. At 40 km depth, positive radial anisotropy dominates the entire study area, with peaks of 10-15% under zones of active and inactive volcanism associated with slow velocities (3.4 to 3.9 km/s). Similarly, in the Maracaibo Basin (MaB) and regions limiting with Venezuela, positive radial anisotropy and slow velocities (18% - 3.7 km/s) are observed.
At 50 km depth, the Voigt average displays slow velocities (3.9 - 4.2 km/s) below the CC and the EC, likely due to crustal thicknesses over 50 km, and a marked positive
radial anisotropy of 10%. Fast velocities (4.4 km/s) under the LMB and the SMM and MaB (4.5 - 4.6 km/s) probably reflect the presence of upper mantle rocks. Except for the CC and the EC, radial anisotropy is slightly positive (2 - 3%) throughout the region. At 80 km depth, Voigt average velocities increase from West to East, with low values (4.4 km/s) under the Pacific coast, the WC, the CC, the TB and the Panama arc and high values under the MMV and the EC. Alternating patterns of small positive and negative radial anisotropy (1 - 2 %) are observed throughout, except under the LMB where negative values of radial anisotropy are larger. The velocity and anisotropy patterns at 120 km depth are similar to those reported at 80 km.
The vertical relationship between the velocity and anisotropy patterns described above is demonstrated through a number of cross-sections in Figures 9 through 11. Note how positive anisotropy of 7 - 20% pervades the entire lower crust, with values becoming largest under the CC and the EC and with correspondingly high values of isotropic shear velocities (3.8 - 4.0 km/s). More in detail, Figure 9a shows a crosssection through the Caribbean region. Under the LMB, positive anisotropy values for the entire crust are observed, along with slow velocities (2.8-3.4 km/s); in this area, the positive anisotropy layer located between 20-30 km seems to delimit the top of the Caribbean plate. Under the SLR high values of negative radial anisotropy and high Voigt averages, respectively (3.6 km/s - 10%), are found (Figure 9a).
The cross-section in Figure 9b crosses the CC and the EC at latitude 6°N, where CC volcanism ceases, showing negative values of anisotropy in the upper (15%) and middle (5%) crust under the CC and slightly positive (5 %) under the EC, where the inactive Iza-Paipa volcanic complexes are located. Figure 10a displays another cross
section through the CC and EC, now at latitude 4°N. Regions with active volcanism (south of 5.5°N) are characterized with negative anisotropy (5%) and slow velocity (3.4 km/s); intriguingly, a similar pattern is observed under the EC where no surface volcanism is observed. Finally, Figure 10b maps the volcanic complexes at latitude 2°N, showing negative radial anisotropy and slow isotropic velocities (15% - 2.6 km/s) in the upper and middle crusts.
A SW-NE transect (Figure 11) is presented crossing the entire study area. As mentioned, slow isotropic velocities (3.4 km/s) are observed below the volcanic provinces, with negative anisotropy in the middle crust (5 - 10%). Absence of positive radial anisotropy between 30 and 50 km of depth coincides with the location of the volcanic gap under the CC (250 to 430 km along profile). A region with hight Voigt averages (4.0 km/s) between 20 - 35 km depth is observed under the CC, where the volcanism filnalizes (between 600 - 800 km along profile), with values of negative anisotropy of 5%. The lower crust, as mentioned before, displays positive radial anisotropy throughout.
4.	Implications for fluid flow and deformation
One of the main findings reported in Poveda et al. (2018) was the presence of marked slow velocities within the crust (25 - 35 km depth), mimicking the track of the surface volcanism along the CC and EC. Such slow velocities were interpreted as resulting from subduction-related melts that pond at mid-crustal depths in the overriding plate. Poveda et al. (2018) further noticed that volcanism along the EC is inactive, and that the presence of slow velocities in the underlying crust implied that it was not extinct.
The Voigt averages obtained in this study extend the presence of such slow velocities under the surface volcanics down to 40 km depth (Figure 7e), with associated positive anisotropy (Figure 7f); more interestingly, estimates of radial anisotropy show that negative radial anisotropy characterizes the crust immediately above (&amp;lt;25 km depth) under the CC, where volcanism is active, while positive radial anisotropy characterizes a similar depth-range under the EC, where volcanism is inactive (Figures 7b, 10). We speculate that the negative radial anisotropy might be related to some structural alignment in the vertical direction, for instance, emplacement of magmas intruding through sub-vertical feeding dykes. Indeed, recent studies (Londono, 2016 and Murcia et al., 2018) from seismological and geochemical data reported a deep magmatic body emplaced at about 20-40 km depth north of the active volcanic segment at ~4.5°N that feed several active volcanoes in the area (e.g. Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, Cerro Bravo volcano and Cerro Machin volcano). Moreover, Lundgren et al. (2015), reported the existence of dykes in the shallow crust under the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano from InSAR modelling. On the other hand, under the Iza-Paipa volcanic complex in the EC, positive radial anisotropy is observed, which is consistent with the proposal that volcanism in this area is inactive but not extinct (Bernet et al., 2016; Poveda et al., 2018). The profile in Figure 09b clearly shows a low-velocity zone under eastern side of EC at depths between 25 and 35 km associated with an area with strong positive radial anisotropy, suggesting the presence of horizontally lying magma bodies. The absence of negative radial anisotropy immediatelly above would indicate the absence of dyke systems feeding the surface volcanoes.
In the Caribbean region, positive radial anisotropy is found under the LMB at all crustal levels (Figures 7 and 9) overlying the Caribbean flat slab. In this region, Poveda et al. (2018) found a the crust is characterized by slow S-velocity (VSV), as also observed through the Voigt average in this work, and raised two hypotheses. The first hypothesis was related to the presence of Middle Miocene (13-14 Ma) mafic volcanism within the Caribbean continental margin, as reported by Lara et al. (2013). Those authors proposed that asthenospheric magmas might have breached the Caribbean flat slab through a preexisting vertical tear, and that they are now ponding at mid-crustal depths within the overriding plate. Indeed, this hypothesis would be consistent with positive anisotropy, provided that melts were ponding in flay-lying structures such as sills. Note that, if this were correct, the preferred storage of the melts along horizontal structures (rather than vertical structures such as feeding dykes) would additionally explain the paucity of surface volcanism in the region. The second hypothesis was related to fluid migration along major crustal faults (Corbeau et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 1996); this hypothesis would be inconsistent with positive anisotropy, as SPO from vertical structures such as faults would be expected to yield negative anisotropy (Yudistira et al., 2017).
Alternatively, crustal extension might also explain positive anisotropy. The Plato (PB) and San Jorge Basins (SJB), which are part of the LMB, have been suggested to result from extensional stresses produced by a Miocene to Recent, 23°-30° clockwise rotation of the Santa Marta Massif (Montes et al., 2010), with a total of 50-56 km of east-west shortening in the Cesar-Rancheria Basin (CRB) and 115 km of extensión throughout the LMB. In the shallow crust, the deposition of thick, flat-lying sedimentary
sequences (Lara et al., 2013; Montes et al., 2010; Vernette et al., 1992), with alternating layers of fast and slow S-velocity, might be responsible for the observed positive radial anisotropy (Xie et al., 2013; Yudistira et al., 2017); in the middle crust, positive radial anisotropy could result from subhorizontal alignment of anisotropic minerals due to CPO associated to the extensional process. Additionally, dragging through coupling with the Caribbean flat slab right under the LMB might have induced sub-horizontal shear in the upper plate, which might in turn have further contributed to positive radial anisotropy (Gerbault and Willingshofer, 2004; Karato, 2008).
Radial anisotropy in the lower crust is commonly explained by CPO of minerals due to sub-horizontal plastic or ductile channel flow (Karato, 2008). This mechanism of deformation has been invoked in Tibet (e.g. (Guo et al., 2012; Shapiro, 2004; Xie et al., 2013), where crustal thickness is more than 50 km, to explain the extensional setting and crustal thinning of the region (Shapiro, 2004). Most recently, it has also been invoked to explain positive radial anisotropy in the middle and lower crust in some parts of the Central Andes (Lynner et al., 2018). This mechanism produces sub-horizontal shear zones at the boundaries between the upper and lower crusts, and between the lower crust and lithospheric mantle, and might be playing a role in the pervasive positive radial anisotropy reported in this study for the Colombian Andes (Figure 7h). However, we note that the magnitude of positive anisotropy is stronger where active and inactive volcanism are found, and that it is coincident with slow S-velocities. This makes as think that magmatic storage in flat-lying sills is more plausible. The mechanism under CC is more likely to be related to horizontally aligned magmatic addition, which can also play a role in thickening the crust (Poveda et al. 2015) and agrees with the proposal of
Weber et al. (2002) of magmatic addition from the upper mantle wedge. Under the EC, a combination of SPO and CPO due to horizontally lying magma bodies and upper mantle flow (Yarce et al. 2014) could be a plausible explanation for the observe positive radial anisotropy, as it would explain non-isostatic residual topography associated with subduction.
In the upper mantle, radial anisotropy is generally small (2 %) and can probably be ignored. However moderate (4 %) negative radial anisotropy is observed north of latitude 8°N below 80 km depth (Figures 08 and 09). According to Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015a), the Caribbean plate subducts under NW South America with an anomalous low angle of 3-8° over a distance of 200 km into the South American continent from the trench zone. If the Caribbean plate is indeed characterized by negative radial anisotropy, we can then suggest that the southern termination of the Caribbean slab occurs at around of 8°N. This suggests that the Nazca plate can extend to at least 8°N, which implies that the limit at 5.5 N (seismicity offset) represents a slab tear as proposed by Chiarabba et al. (2016), Syracuse et al. (2016), and Wagner et al. (2017) rathern than a boundary between two separate plates (e.g. Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015b; Yarce et al. (2014); Cortés and Angelier, 2005; Taboada et al., 2000).
Finally, negative radial anisotropy also characterizes the upper crust of some tectonic blocks, such as the SMM, AB, SM, SRL and IB (Figure 7b). The SMM, SM, SRL and IB they are of plutonic nature and represents a NNE-trending batholitic record of Late Triassic - Jurassic age associated with volcanic rocks distributed along of the Central Cordillera and the middle and upper Magdalena Valley (UMV) (Bustamante et
al., 2016; Spikings et al., 2015). In particular, the AB is the most important intrusive body of the northern segment of the Central Cordillera (Restrepo-Moreno et al., 2009). The origin of those magmatic pulses have been associated to oblique subduction of the Farallon plate, which explains the segmented distribution of these batholiths along the CC (Bustamante et al. 2016). The intrusive nature of these bodies, especially the SMM, SM, SRL and IB, with similar ages and genesis, can explain the negative anisotropy through vertical shape preferred orientation (SPO). Furthermore, Restrepo-Moreno et al., (2009) reported long-term erosional exhumation of the Antioqueno plateau, which includes the AB, along with deformation related to uplift, shortening and high fault angles making negative radial anisotropy more likely. Also, the modern stress regime is accommodated by major structures within the North Andean Block through lateral escape at 6±2 mm/a to the northeast, with the South American plate acting as a rigid body, while the Panama-arc (or Panama-Choco Block) is in active collision at a rate of ~25 mm/yr (Egbue et al., 2014; Trenkamp et al., 2002). Escape tectonics could be triggering a combined shortening-and-upplift deformation that would be consistent with negative radial anisotropy, especially under the CC.
5.	Conclusions
Combined Rayleigh and Love wave tomography using seismic ambient noise (7 - 38 s) and earthquake sources (40 - 150 s) revealed the radial anisotropic structure under NW South America. Anisotropic parameters were obtained through a linearized inversion scheme that estimated 3-D variation in VSV and VSH in the crust and upper mantle. Positive anisotropy is pervasive in the lower crust, especially under the CC and EC, consistent with the accumulation of subduction-related magmas along flat-lying
structures. Positive radial anisotropy if found under the LMB at all crustal levels, perhaps due to a combination of SPOs from extensional stresses, drag by the Caribbean flat slab, and storage of asthenospheric magmas breaching the slab. Negative radial anisotropy characterizes the upper and middle crusts under the CC, where surface volcanism is active, which can be related magmatic alignment along subvertical feeding dykes, positive radial anisotropy is observed at similar depth-ranges under the EC, suggesting storage of magmas along flat-lying sills. Weak negative radial anisotropy is observed throghout the upper mantle, except under the LMB, perhaps marking the lateral exteng of the Caribbean flat slab.

Discussion
The manuscripts presented in the previous chapters have reported on two tomographic studies that map the structure of the crust and upper mantle under NW South America in unprecedented detail. The most important features revealed by the S-wave velocity model developed from the seismic tomographies are: (i) The strong correlation between slow S velocities at mid-crustal depths (25-35 km) and surface volcanism in the CC; (ii) The presence of even slower S-velocities in the mid-crust under the inactive volcanoes of the EC (Paipa and Iza); (iii) The presence of similarly slow S velocities under the Lower Magdalena Basin, where slower-than-average S velocities are found for almost the entire depth range; (iv) Positive radial anisotropy throughout the lower crust, particularly under CC and EC; (v) Negative radial anisotropy in middle crust under the CC, where volcanism is active, and positive radial anisotropy under the EC, where volcanism is inactive; (vi) Negative anisotropy at mid-crustal levels where major tectonic terrains (e.g., SMM, IB, AB, SLR) and regions of active volcanism are located; (vii) Positive anisotropy characterizing major coastal basins (e.g., LMB, TB); (viii) Positive radial anisotropy under the LMB at all crustal levels; (ix) Moderate (4 %) negative radial anisotropy in the upper mantle under the LMB.
The joint interpretation of isotropic (Voigt) S-velocities and radial anisotropy has al
lowed to investigate the relationship between crustal fluids and active/inactive volcanims under NW South America. The main conclusions have been that: (i) Under active volca-nims along the CC, slow velocities and negative radial anisotropy might be related to emplacement of magmas along intruding, sub-vertical dyke systems feeding the volcanics; (ii) Slow velocities and positive radial anisotropy under the Iza-Paipa volcanic complex in the EC is consistent with storage of magmas in flat-lying sills, reinforcing the proposal that volcanism in this area is inactive but not extinct; (iii) The presence of positive radial anisotropy in all the crust under the LMB is consistent with horizontal structures in this area, suggesting that the effect of migration of fluids in faults may be minimal or negligible; (iv) Negative anisotropy under the LMB at upper mantle depths, seems to map the shallow flat subduction of the Caribbean plate, suggesting that the limit between the Nazca and the Caribbean plates is around latitude 8°N.
In the following, the interpretation of our results and their implications are discussed in more detail.
6.1 Comparison with independent studies
The S-velocity model for the upper and middle crusts shows a generally good agreement with previous studies in southern Colombia, such as the Narino Project active-source profiling survey (Meissnar et al. 1976, Meyer et al. 1976, Mooney et al. 1979, Flueh et al. 1981). The results of Meissnar et al. (1976) for the region at 1°N and 4°N and 82°W and 76°W, for instance, showed that P-wave velocities ranged between 6.0 and 6.8 km/s for the upper and lower crusts and ~8.0 km/s for the underlying mantle. Through conversion of these values into S-wave velocity, after assuming a Vp/Vs of 1.78 (Ojeda &amp;amp; Havskov 2001), it is observed that this range of velocities compares similarly to the results reported in this thesis.
At shallow crustal levels, S-velocities in this study are consistent with major surface
geological features (Gomez et al. 2007, Veloza et al. 2012). Slow S-wave velocities correlate with the main sedimentary basins and with offshore regions (LMB, TB, MMV, MaB, EC), while high velocities are consistent with the regions where the main massifs, metamorphic rocks, batholiths and plutons are located (SMM, SM, AB, SLR, IB, GM). Alternated low and high velocities are correlated with the main fault systems: the Romeral fault system, from the LMB to the northern segment of the CC; the Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault System, which divides the LMB from the SMM; and the Otu-Pericos Faults System, which separates the CC and the MMV.
Our results are consistent with reported values of sedimentary thickness in Laske &amp;amp; Masters (1997) (Figure 6.1) for the upper crust. The slow velocity region in the lower Magdalena Valley coincides with sediment thickness values up to 7 km; similarly, in the Pacific coast under the Tumaco basin and the Eastern Cordillera, sediment thickness values are between 3 and 5 km and are associated with slow shear wave velocities. In contrast, regions with thin sedimentary layers (&lt;2 km) such as the Central Cordillera and the Santa Marta Massif are imaged with high velocities in the tomographic slices.
The results presented in this work are also comparable to those produced by Syracuse et al. (2016), where images of lateral P wave and S wave velocity variation down to 155 km depth were developed for the Colombian Andes and adjacent regions. Their S-velocity depth slices at 12.5 km and 32.5 km (see Figure 6 in Syracuse et al., 2016) have similar dimensions to our S-velocity maps at 10 and 35 km depth, displaying similar S-velocity patterns throughout the area. At shallow crustal depths, both studies show slow velocities in the LMB and the Eastern Llanos, separated by faster velocities in the intervening cordilleras; at intermediate crustal depths, both studies display slow velocities in the LMB and under the volcanic areas of the EC and CC. Due to the inclusion of shorter periods in our velocity models, however, our velocity images have better resolution at short wavelengths. Our images, for instance, clearly depict the fast velocities characterizing the Antioqueno batholith at shallow depths and successfully image intra-crustal slow velocity
regions that mimic the patterns described by surface volcanism.
Similarly, it is possible to compare our results for the upper mantle with the results presented in Syracuse et al. (2016). At 100 km depth, both studies show high velocities under the LMB, SMM, MMV and the EC, while low velocities are found under the Panamá arc and under active volcanism. Their results, however, differ from ours below the WC and the TB, where low velocities are found for our study in contrast with high velocities resolved in Syracuse et al. (2016). The differences may be related to the use of different datasets and methodologies; while Syracuse et al. (2016) used 134 local events (&amp;lt;1000 km) to make Rayleigh dispersion measurements, 1340 events with P- and S-wave readings, and gravity data, we used a larger selection of 430 local (&amp;lt;1000 km), 270 regional (1000 - 2000 km) and 420 teleseismic (&gt; 2000 km) earthquake sources with magnitudes larger than 4.5 and depths less than 30 km. This resulted in a total of 1120 events, and over 10.000 dispersion curves for Rayleigh wave and 7.000 for Love waves covering all NW South America. Additionally, the methodology used in Syracuse et al. (2016) consisted of a combined body-wave velocity tomography algorithm (tomoDD) (Zhang &amp;amp; Thurber 2006), and a joint inversion algorithm for surface wave dispersion curves and gravity anomalies (Maceira &amp;amp; Ammon 2009). The body-wave, surface-wave and gravity data are combined in a single system of equations with weighting factors that control the contributions of each data types to the solution. The method seems quite sensitive to the chosen weight values for each dataset, if over-fitting of observables is to be avoided (Zhang et al. 2014). An LSQR approach is used to solve the system of equations (Paige &amp;amp; Saunders 1982).
6.2	Shear Velocities and Radial anisotropy
One of the most common forms of anisotropy is radial anisotropy, which is also know as transverse isotropy. It may develop, for instance, for a stack of layered materials (Stein
Figure 6.2: Schematic diagram showing radial anisotropy due to layering, with displacements of P and S waves propagating in the x1 direction. The S1 wave (SH) travels faster than the S2 (SV), because the latter travel across layering. (Adapted from Stein and Wysession, 2003).
&amp;amp; Wysession 2003), where each layer is isotropic in their properties, but these properties differ from layer to layer. A transversely isotropic material is one with physical properties which are symmetric about an axis that is normal to a plane of isotropy. In this case, the elastic properties do not depend on the azimuth of propagation of the waves in the horizontal plane, but differ in the perpendicular direction (Babuska &amp;amp; Cara 1991).
For transverselly isotropic media, the elastic tensor Cijkl contains five independent elastic constants; this is a particular case of anisotropy, because the two quasi-shear wave polarizations correspond to SH and SV (Shearer 2009). Transverse isotropy is frequently invoked in seismic reflection surveys and sedimentary layering of the crust and, more recently, in ambient noise tomography studies that investigate past and ongoing crustal deformation (Moschetti et al. 2010b, Lynner et al. 2018, Yudistira et al. 2017). In the upper mantle, it is generally utilized to account for discrepancies between Love and Rayleigh surface-wave velocities.
A case where radial anisotropy develops is illustrated in Figure 6.2. Let’s consider
a medium with horizontal layers, with waves propagating in the x1 direction. The shear velocities will depend on the polarization of the particle motions, with waves polarized in one plane traveling faster (s1) than those polarized in the other plane (s2). Commonly, horizontal layering is observed in the Earth and resulting in transverse anisotropy with vertical axis of symmetry. VSH is generally faster than VSV, since the VSH displacement is in the plane of the layering. This is called positive radial anisotropy (VSH &gt; VSV); on the other hand, when VSH &amp;lt;VSV, the term adopted is negative radial anisotropy.
Radial anisotropy is inferred from VSV and VSH velocity models by first estimating isotropic S-velocity through the Voigt average
VS	+ vsh )/3
(6.1)
and then computing the percentage of radial anisotropy (y) as
=	x 100%
(Vsh + Vsv )
(6.2)
Anisotropy can originate through two primordial processes: (i) Crystal Preferred Orientation (CPO), in which anisotropy emerges from a preferred orientation of intrinsically anisotropic crystals; and (ii) Shape Preferred Orientation (SPO), in which the material is isotropic at fine scales but anisotropic at coarser scales, inducing seismic anisotropy at long wavelengths compared to the scale of the heterogeneity (Shearer 2009).
SPO is associated to geological structures, such as sedimentary layering, magmatic intrusions, dykes, sills, melt lenses and partial melting (Spica et al. 2017, Yudistira et al. 2017). Those include fine alternating layers of fast and slow material or small aligned cracks within a rock, which can cause radial anisotropy when the wavelength exceeds the dimensions of the layer or crack spacing. This mechanism is the most important to explain radial anisotropy in the upper and middle crusts (Karato 2008). As mentioned earlier, negative radial anisotropy is generated when VSV propagates faster than VSH, which
can be explained through SPO due to vertically aligned structures such as vertical shear zones, high fault density in sedimentary sequences and/or dyke system. Positive radial anisotropy (VSH &gt;	) by SPO, on the other hand, is related to horizontal layering and/or
aligned cracks and structures, such as horizontal bedding in sediments, fabric alignment created by extension and/or magma storage in flat-lying sills.
Radial anisotropy induced by CPO of micas, has been invoked by Shapiro et al. (2004) to explain horizontal flow in the middle crust due to crustal thinning in Tibet. The CPO mechanism is more dominant in the lower crust and upper mantle (Karato 2008), due to the presence of strongly anisotropic minerals such as olivine or orthopyroxenes. These minerals present strong anisotropy, with seismic velocities often differing by 20% or more among the different directions defined by the symmetry axes. Large-scale asthenospheric flow, for instance, has been related to CPO (Karato 2008, Shearer 2009). Moreover, CPO in anisotropic minerals, such as amphibole and mica, can generate positive radial anisotropy during deformation at sub-horizontal shear zones in the upper-lower crust and the lower crust-lithospheric mantle boundaries.
6.3	Tectonic and geological implications
6.3.1	Magmatic overprinting in the Eastern Cordillera
The Eastern Cordillera was uplifted during the Cenozoic because of compression of the North Andean Block. Former extensional basins were thus inverted through fault reactivation, facilitating the shortening of the crust and surface uplift of the EC (Kellogg et al. 1995, Taboada et al. 2000, Egbue et al. 2014). The crust in this area has been significantly thickened, reaching values over 50 km (Poveda et al. 2015). The presence of a few isolated, inactive volcanoes (extinct about 6 Ma) may be unrelated to modern arc magmatism (Bernet et al. 2016).
One of the thickening mechanisms may be associated to the shortening of the crust
due to a combination of compression and escape tectonics (Trenkamp et al. 2002). The greatest shortening and high topography formation in the EC began in the Miocene, in response to the accretion of the Panama arc along the western margin of Colombia (Taboada et al. 2000). An alternative mechanism for crustal thickening may be associated to magmatic addition, as evidenced through the Pliocene volcanim reported in (Pardo et al. 2005, Bernet et al. 2016). Our results display a low velocity zone in the middle crust overlying a wide area of positive radial anisotropy down to the lower crust. If shortening were the predominant mechanism, deformation would likely have generated negative radial SPO anisotropy due to vertically oriented structures such as the high-angle faults that bound the EC. However, positive radial anisotropy is observed instead, making some sort of magmatic addition along horizontally lying magma bodies more likely.
Moreover, in the upper crust positive radial anisotropy might be related to sub-horizontal structures that prevent magmas from reaching the surface. Although shortening of the EC cannot be ruled out, we suggest that the dominating mechanism is magmatic addition. The mechanims of magmatic addition could be related to mantle flow or some other convective disturbance below the EC, as those would explain non-isostatic residual topography associated with subduction reported by Yarce et al. (2014).
6.3.2	Implications for extension and melts in the Lower Magdalena Basin
The Lower Magdalena Basin is an Oligocene to Recent basin, located between two basement massifs: the Central Cordillera and Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Santa Marta Massif), and the Sinu and San Jacinto fold belts (Mora-Bohorquez et al. 2017). This area includes the Plato (PB) and San Jorge Basins (SJB). The evolutionary characteristics of this basin indicate that from the Oligocene it behaves as a set of rotational and extensional basins (Montes et al. 2010, Mora-Bohorquez et al. 2017), due to the oblique and shallow
subduction of the Caribbean Plate without subduction-related volcanims.
In this area, we have reported slow shear velocities with positive radial anisotropy throughout the crust. In the upper crust, the slow velocities seem to be controlled structurally by the Romeral Fault and the trench zone below Sinu and San Jacinto, which may be related to the dense sedimentary cover reported for this area (Vernette et al. 1992, Lara et al. 2013, Mora-Bohórquez et al. 2017). In the middle and lower crust slow velocities and positive radial anisotropy extend throughout the LMB. Two hypotheses were proposed to explain the low velocities in the middle and upper crust. The first hypothesis was related to the presence of Middle Miocene (13-14 Ma) mafic volcanism within the Caribbean continental margin, as reported by Lara et al. (2013). Those authors proposed that asthenospheric magmas might have breached the Caribbean flat slab through a preexisting vertical tear, and that they are now ponding at mid-crustal depths within the overriding plate. The second hypothesis was related to fluid migration along major crustal faults (Zhao et al. 1996, Corbeau et al. 2017). Taking the observations of positive radial anisotropy for this region into account, it is easy to rule out the effect of fault migration, since negative radial anisotropy related to vertical faults should be observed. Nonetheless, the presence of the Romeral fault system in the LMB, could indeed be the object of fluid migration, and negative radial anisotropy should be expected under the Sinú and San Jacinto fold belts. Observations of positive radial anisotropy and low velocity dominate the entire LMB, suggesting the first hypothesis is more plausible. Moreover, if this hypothesis is considered, the storage of the melts along horizontal structures located in the middle and lower crusts would explain the paucity of surface volcanism in the region.
An additional mechanism that can contribute to generate positive radial anisotropy under the LMB is extension in the area, which has been active since the Early Cenozoic. Montes et al. (2005) document a recent, 23°-30° clockwise rotation of the Santa Marta Massif, with a total of 50-56 km of east-west shortening in the Cesar-Rancheria Basin (CRB) and 115 km of extensión throughout the LMB. This is consistent with a small
crustal thickness in the Caribbean Plains between 25 and 31 km (Poveda et al. 2015). Under that mechanism, positive radial anisotropy could result from sub-horizontal realignment of crystals due to extension.
6.3.3	Implications for fluid flow and deformation in the Central cordillera
The Central Cordillera hosts active volcanism and keeps a Late Triassic to Late Jurassic record of magmatism between 203 and 145 Ma (Aspden et al. 1987, Spikings et al. 2015, Bustamante et al. 2016), which includes large NW-NE batholiths associated with volcanic rocks distributed along the eastern margin of the Central Cordillera and the middle and upper Magdalena River Valley (UMV). Our results show high velocities in the upper crust that mark the footprint of those batholiths (Ibague, Antioquia, and Segovia in the San Lucas Range). Radial anisotropy is predominantly negative, which may indicate an intrusive nature for these bodies, especially the SMM, SM, SRL and IB. With similar ages and genesis, it can explain negative anisotropy through vertical shape preferred orientation (SPO). Negative anisotropy with high velocities can also be consistent with the modern stress regime, through accommodation by major structures within the North Andean Block, deformation related to uplift, shortening, and high fault angles (Restrepo-Moreno et al., 2008), and exhumation of the Antioqueno Plateau including the AB.
One of the most important results of this thesis is that subduction-related melts are marked by slow velocities within the crust (25 - 35 km depth), while estimates of radial anisotropy show a negative character throughout the crust immediately above (&amp;lt;25 km depth). We suggest that negative radial anisotropy is consistent with structural alignment in the vertical direction, through sub-vertical feeding dykes and an SPO mechanim. In the lower crust, positive anisotropy with slow velocities are observed, similar to the EC,
suggesting the presence of horizontally lying magma bodies. Recent studies (Londono 2016, Murcia et al. 2018) have proved the existence of a common magmatic body about 20-40 km depth that feeds the volcanoes of northern Colombia, which is consistent with our interpretation.
6.3.4	Negative radial anisotropy of the Caribbean plate
The radial anisotropy found in the upper mantle is generally small (±2%) and can likely be disregarded. However, a moderate value of 4% and negative sign is found under the Lower Magdalena Valley. According to several authors (van der Hilst &amp;amp; Mann 1994, Taboada et al. 2000, Vargas &amp;amp; Mann 2013) the Caribbean plate subducts under NW South America with an anomalous low angle over a distance of 200 km into the South American continent. According to (Bowland &amp;amp; Rosencratz 1988) the Caribbean plate is a thick oceanic plateau, with a crustal thicknesses that can reach ~20 km. The Caribbean plate may have formed in an intrusive environment, which would be consistent with the observed negative anisotropy. Our observations would then imply that the southern termination of the Caribbean slab occurs at around of 8°N, and that the Nazca plate might be extending north to 8°N. If correct, the offset in seismicity at 5.5°N would represent a slab tear (Chiarabba et al. 2016, Syracuse et al. 2016, Wagner et al. 2017) rather than a boundary between two separate plates (Yarce et al. 2014, Cortés et al. 2006, Taboada et al. 2000).
Chapter 7
Conclusions and future work
Through cross-correlation of long time series, from 2012 to 2016, of ambient seismic noise between stations, we have obtained Rayleigh and Love wave phase and group velocity dispersion curves at periods between 7 s and 38 s. From earthquake sources at regional and teleseismic distances, group velocity curves of Rayleigh and Loves wave have been determined from 11,000 surface-wave trains at periods from 40 to 150 s. Surface wave tomographic maps between 7 to 150 s, have been used to estimated 3-D variations in VSV and VSH in the crust and upper mantle down to 140 km depth. These results have then been used to infer shear velocity Voigt average and radial anisotropy maps for NW South america with unprecedent resolution. The results resolve geological features with high accuracy at shallow levels, as well as features associated with magmatism, revealing the relationship between crustal fluids and active/inactive volcanims under NW South America. In the middle crust, negative anisotropy is found under active volcanics, consistent with sub-vertical magmatic dykes; in contrast, positive radial anisotropy is observed under inactive volcanism along the EC, suggesting storage along flat-lying sills. Positive radial anisotropy pervades the entire lower crust, suggesting widespread accumulation of subduction-related melts. In the upper mantle, negative radial anisotropy under the LMB is found consistent with the proposed extent of Caribbean flat subduction.
Future research that can be based on the results of this thesis include:
•	Investigate the most important seismic discontinuities in NW South America from the Common-Conversion-Point stacking of receiver functions (Dueker &amp;amp; Sheehan 1997, Frassetto et al. 2010), in order to find phase conversions that can improve the results of crustal thickness found in Poveda et al. (2015) and the main discontinuites in the upper mantle. However, due to the strong lateral hetereogeneities of the Andean the crust (dipping boundaries and/or anisotropic structures), it would be advisable to develop the migration of the isotropic part of the receiver functions, after application of harmonic decomposition (Bianchi et al. 2010).
•	Taking advantage of the isotropic receiver functions, the joint inversion of receiver functions and surface waves dispersion observations (Julia et al. 2000) could be applied, gaining greater control of the main interfaces in the crust and the upper mantle.
•	Improve the upper mantle seismic structure beneath NW South America from P-and S-wave regional and teleseimic traveltime tomography (Schimmel et al. 2003, Rocha et al. 2011), perhaps jointly inverting with group delays from the surfacewave dispersion curves develop in this thesis (West et al. 2004).

Appendix A
Crustal thickness estimates
The crustal thickness map presented in Poveda et al. (2015) from receiver function analysis has been updated in this thesis, following the procedures described in their study. We include 11 new stations that improve the sampling of the Caribbean region, the WC and the CC. We include new receiver functions at previous stations, as well. In the table A.1 results of crustal thickness with associated uncertainties are presented, with misfit obtained with bootstrap method (Efron &amp;amp; J. Tibshirani 1993) with 500 replications. About 5000 receiver functions recorded in 43 stations were analyzed. In the Figures A.1 and A.2 the distribution of events ordered by ray parameter and back-azimuth are displayed. In figures (A.3 to A.11) the h — K stacks (Zhu &amp;amp; Kanamori 2000) for new stations not included in the previous study are displayed.
