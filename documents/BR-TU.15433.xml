Ultrasonographic and ecobiometric findings in the eyes of adult goats

Achados  ultrasonográficos  e  ecobiométricos  em  olhos  de  cabras  adultas

ABSTRACT

The knowledge of the normal appearance and
ocular dimensions of goat eyes facilitates the use of
ultrasonography in the evaluation of ocular disease. The
objective of the present study was to determine ultrasonographic
and ecobiometric findings in the eyes of adult goats. B- and A-
mode ultrasonography was performed in 30 healthy adult goats
(60 eyes) (n=5 intact females and n=15 castrated males).
Ultrasonography was performed after instillation of a topical
anesthetic. Lubricating jelly was placed on the 20MHz
transducer tip as a stand-off pad. The transducer was placed in
a longitudinal position until optimal B-scan images, according
to echoes of the A-mode images, were obtained. Statistical
analysis was carried out to compare the ecobiometric readings
among genders (P&lt;0.05). Means and standard deviations of
the ocular structures for male and female goats, respectively,
were, 3.46±0.55, 3.33±0.46mm (anterior chamber depth);
8.60±0.34, 8.65±0.39mm (lens thickness); 11.34±0.61,
11.39±0.66mm (vitreous chamber depth); and 23.43±0.92,
23.39±0.86mm (axial globe length). Ocular measurements
between right and left eyes, as well as between males and females
were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). The ultrasonographic
appearances of goat eyes were very similar to those of other
domestic and wild species.

RESUMO

Conhecer o aspecto e as dimensões de olhos de
cabras facilita o uso da ultrassonografia na avaliação de
doenças oculares. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi o de

avaliar os achados ultrassonográficos e ecobiométricos em
olhos de cabras adultas. Ultrassonogramas nos modos A e B
foram realizados em 30 caprinos adultos (60 olhos) (n=15
fêmeas intactas e n=15 machos castrados). O exame
ultrassonográfico foi realizado após a instilação de colírio
anestésico. Gel a base de água foi utilizado sobre o transdutor
de 20 MHz posicionado-o de forma longitudinasobre a córneal,
até que imagens no modo B estivessem de acordo com os ecos
gerados pelo modo A. Utilizou-se análise estatística para se
comparar os achados ecobiométricos entre os sexos (p&lt;0,05).
As médias com seus respectivos desvios padrões das estruturas
oculares em machos e fêmeas foram, respectivamente,
3,46±0,55, 3,33±0,46mm (profundidade da câmara anterior);
8,60±0,34, 8,65±0,39mm (espessura da lente); 11,34±0,61,
11,39±0,66mm (profundidade da câmara vítrea) e 23,43±0,92,
23,39±0.86mm (comprimento axial do bulbo ocular). Não foi
observada diferença significativa entre os olhos direito e
esquerdo, assim como entre machos e fêmeas (p&gt;0,05). O
aspecto ultrassonográfico de olhos de cabras se assemelha
com o de outras espécies domésticas e silvestres.

INTRODUCTION

It is known that ocular diseases in food-
producing animals play a significant role in economic
losses (WHITTAKER et al., 2003; POTTER et al., 2008).

and cases of phenothiazine toxicosis may cause
corneal opacity (WHITTAKER et al., 2003). Corneal
edema is a common clinical sign of corneal ulceration,
keratitis, anterior uveitis, and many systemic diseases,
and precludes the direct visualization of intraocular
structures by ophthalmoscopy (WHITTAKER et al.,
2003). Under such conditions, alternative diagnostic
methods for intraocular diseases must be explored
(BOROFFKA et al., 1998; BENTLEY et al., 2003;
SCOTTY et al., 2004).

In the scope of investigative
ophthalmology, the eyes of goats are frequently used
in in vitro research, notably in pharmacodynamic
studies of drugs (PAWAR &amp;amp; MAJUMDAR, 2007), or
for training novice surgeons in different techniques of
phacoemulsification for cataract removal (DADA &amp;amp;
SIDHU, 2000; SUDAN et al., 2002). However, knowledge
of ophthalmic parameters in this species is still sparse
and must be defined (GALÁN et al., 2006; MORALES
et al., 2006; BROADWATER et al., 2007).

Transcorneal ultrasonography enables the
evaluation of intraocular structures in opaque eyes.
Ocular biometry is a useful tool for the assessment of
abnormalities such as phthisis bulbi, microphthalmia,
pseudoexophthalmia, scleral ectasia, and congenital
glaucoma (BRANDÃO et al., 2007; POTTER et al., 2008).
They allow calculations of intraocular lens dioptric power
to be employed in eyes of animals that have undergone
cataract surgery to achieve emmetropia (SAMPAIO et
al., 2002; McMULLEN &amp;amp; GILGER, 2006; ZHOU et al.,
2006; CARTER et al., 2007). Additionally, biometry values
are frequently used for the construction of schematic
eyes in optics (GÖRIG et al., 2006).

Knowledge of the ultrasonographic
appearance and normal dimensions of the eye would
serve as a basis for ultrasonographic examinations when
ocular disease may have caused alterations in the
dimensions and appearance (BENTLEY et al., 2003;
SCOTTY et al., 2004; POTTER et al., 2008). For this
reason, the aim of this research was to study the
dimensions (ecobiometry) and the ultrasonographic
aspect of adult goats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Thirty adult Boer/Alpine cross breed goats
(Capra hircus) (60 eyes) (15 intact females and 15 castrated
males), with an average age of 549 days were used in this
study. Prior to ultrasonographic evaluation, all subjects
underwent a complete ophthalmic examination based on
dazzle and pupillary reflexes, Schirmer tear testa, slit lamp
biomicroscopyb, intraocular pressurec, binocular indirect
ophthalmoscopyd, and fluorescein staininge.

A- and B- mode ultrasonographyf were
performed in both eyes simultaneously by the same
operator after administration of a topical anestheticg.
Lubricating jellyh was placed on the 20MHz transducer
tip as a stand-off pad. The transducer was placed in a
longitudinal position (sagittal plane) until optimal B-
scan images, according to echoes of the A-mode, were
obtained. The anterior chamber depth was measured
as the distance between echoes from the posterior
corneal surface and the anterior lens surface. The lens
thickness was the distance between echoes from the
anterior and posterior lens surfaces. The vitreous
chamber depth was the distance between echoes from
the posterior lens surface and the retina. The axial globe
length was measured from the posterior corneal surface
to the retina. For all measurements, the gain was set at
80dB, and the velocity of sound was 1,532m s-1 for the
anterior chamber, 1,641m s-1 for the lens, and 1,523m s-1
for the vitreous chamber at a depth of 4.0cm. Gender
data were compared using T testi. A value of P&lt;0.05
was considered to be significant.

RESULTS

In accordance with the ultrasonographic
findings in other domestic species, the aqueous and
vitreous humors of the goats, as well as the lens cortices
and nuclei, appeared anechoic. The cornea, anterior
and posterior lens capsule, sclera and iris appeared
hyperechoic, and generated peaks on the A-mode
(Figure 1). The cornea generated two peaks on the A-
mode, the first one corresponding to its epithelium,
and the second to its Descemet membrane. On the B-
mode, the iris was identified as being immediately
adjacent to the anterior lens capsule with the thicker,
more irregular ciliary body located adjacent to it. The
scleroretinal rim appeared as a concave echogenic line;
the three layers that comprise this anatomical site could
not be differentiated ultrasonographically. The head
of the optic nerve casts acoustic shadows from its
margins. The ciliary artery could not be identified in
any of the eyes studied.

Regarding ecobiometric measurements, for
all parameters evaluated, significant differences were
not observed between male and female subjects
(P&gt;0.05). The descriptive statistical data of the
ecobiometric values measured in adult male and female
goats are summarized in table 1.

DISCUSSION

The aspheric nature of bovine eye species
was also observed in the present study, in which eyes



570   Ribieiro et al.

of goats were evaluated (POTTER et al., 2008). In
addition, the ultrasonographic appearance of goat eyes
showed great similarity in comparison to other domestic
species (GILGER et al., 1998; OSUOBENI &amp;amp;
HAMIZADA, 1999; BRANDÃO et al., 2004;
McMULLEN &amp;amp; GILGER, 2006; POTTER et al., 2008).
Ultrasonographic studies accomplished in two distinct
bovine breeds were able to identify the ciliary artery in
70% of the animals examined (POTTER et al., 2008). In
the present research, however, it was not possible to
visualize the ciliary artery in both male and female goats,
probably because of the axial globe length of the goats
eyes, which are 27% smaller (23.41mm) than the average
axial globe length of bovines eyes (33.65mm) (POTTER
et al., 2008).

Regarding to ecobiometry, studies of
caprine species were not found in the literature. The
ecobiometric values measured for adult goats resemble
those obtained from Ile de France Sheep of 11 months
of age (BRANDÃO et al., 2004). Although feasible, it
was decided not to measure the axial corneal thickness
since such measurement can be overestimated
ultrasonographically given difficulties in positioning
the calipers exactly on the corneal surfaces. In addition,
some depression in the corneal axial region may occur
due to transducer pressure generating biases (POTTER
et al., 2008). For all parameters measured, significant

differences were not observed between male and female
subjects of the same age. Our findings contrast with
the results of previous reports, which stated that adult
women had shorter axial globe length, shallower
anterior and vitreous chamber depth, and thicker lenses
than adult men (WONG et al, 2001; WARRIER et al.,
2008). Other paper also reported that axial globe length
of adult male dogs was found to be significant longer
than that of adult female dogs (SCHIFFER et al., 1982).
Considering that all adult males used in the research
were castrated, differences related to ecobiometric
readings could be found if intact males and a larger
sample of goats were studied. Although not significant,
minimum and maximum values of anterior chamber
depth in males (1.80mm) and females (1.98mm) goats
varied. Such variances may be attributed to ocular
irritation after jelly instillation and tip of ultrasound
probe, which may reduce intraocular pressure values,
consequently reducing anterior chamber depth due to
antidromic stimuli (KROHNE et al, 1988).

Although discrepancies relative to intra- and
interobserver repeatability are acceptable for measuring
intraocular structures by means of B-mode
ultrasonography in dogs (BOROFFKA et al., 2006), it
was decided that all examinations would be done by
the same person.  OSUOBENI &amp;amp; HAMIZADA (1999)
observed that there can be differences in the readings

ocular structures of camels obtained from A- and B-
mode ultrasonography, with the A-mode being the most
reliable method. Likewise, it was verified that sedation
decreases the likelihood of errors during measurements
with A-mode ultrasonography (EKESTEN, 1994).
Notwithstanding, in this study good ultrasonograms
were obtained with animals under physical restraint
and topical anesthesia. In another study on cadaveric
ovine eyes, it was assumed that ocular distances vary
in accordance with the method employed: A- and B-
mode ultrasonography, or caliper rule (BRANDÃO et
al., 2004). For these reasons, in the present research, it
was decided to calculate all measurements using A-
mode ultrasonography.

The high-resolution 20MHz transducer
used in our study offers a power of penetration ranging
from 2 to 6cm, which is necessary to visualize the entire
globe, without the formation of reverberation artifacts
in the anterior chamber (BENTLEY et al., 2003).
Compared with conventional 10 MHz probes that have
resolutions of 300 to 400?m, high-frequency probes
(20MHz) enable imaging at resolutions comparable to
low-power microscopic views (20?m) (FOSTER et al.,
2000). However, in the equipment used in the present
study, the minimum power of penetration is limited to
20mm, not reaching lower tissue penetrations of 5 to
10mm, which are necessary to visualize structures such
as the ciliary cleft (BENTLEY et al., 2003).

The ultrasound machine used during this
research was calibrated to acoustic wave propagation
velocities for ocular tissue of humans at 1,532m s-1 for
the anterior chamber, 1,641m s-1 for the lens, and 1,523m
s-1 for the vitreous chamber (GÖRIG et al., 2006). The
speed of sound waves in ocular tissues is not constant,
particularly in the lens where it slows gradually from
the center of the structure to the periphery (van der
STEEN et al., 1994). Tissue velocities through the
aqueous and vitreous mediums are similar to that in

water at a similar temperature, while velocities are higher
through the lens, where the value is 1650m s-1 (GÖRIG
et al., 2006). Recent data indicate that conversion factors
for the speed of sound waves through lens tissue are
needed to accurately perform comparative quantitative
A-mode ultrasound studies (GÖRIG et al., 2006). For
example, an underestimation of approximately 4%
results when calculations of the lens thickness in dogs
are made on the basis of sound wave speeds in human
tissues. In contrast, the error in the estimation of
vitreous body depth is approximately 0.2%, and is thus
negligible (GÖRIG et al., 2006). Considering that the
values of the axial lens thickness obtained herein for
adult goats (8.63±0.36mm) are considerably larger than
that of adult humans (4.75±0.47mm) (WONG et al, 2001),
acoustic wave propagation velocities in the ocular
tissues of goats may have lead to some discrepancies
during ultrasonographic measurements in this study.

The results of this research showed that
dimensions of anterior chamber, lens, vitreous chamber
and axial globe length of adult goats did not differ
between the genders. Ultrasonographically, intraocular
chambers and structures resemble those observed for
other animal species. The knowledge of normal ocular
dimensions facilitates the use of ultrasonography in
the evaluation of ocular disease in adult goats.
