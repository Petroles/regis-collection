All the biocenose possesses a particular structure that corresponds
to the disposition of the individuals of the various species in
relation to each other, in both the vertical and horizontal plane.
According to WILLIAMSON et al. (1996), many planktonic organ-
isms exhibit daily vertical migrations in response to the daily
oscillations of several environmental variables. The distribution
of planktonic communities is influenced by the intermediate
disturbance hypothesis proposed by CONNELL (1978), that is, high
diversity is at intermediate levels of disturbance.

The intermediate disturbance hypothesis furnishes an
explanation for the fact that the majority of ecosystems are far
from being at climax or dynamic equilibrium or in a stable
state, in accordance with the theory of ecological succession.
This holds true as long as for the majority, a period of time has
elapsed sufficient for this to be attained. The structure of com-
munities that undergo intermediate perturbations, have their
development, or autogenic succession, delayed, interrupted or
destroyed. This allows the term “intermediate” to be applied

ABSTRACT. The aim of investigation was to study the model of vertical distribution in Lago Amapá, taking into
consideration the seasonality of its zooplanktonic composition. Lago Amapá (10º2’36”S and 67º50’24”W) is
located in the floodplain of the Rio Acre. Samplings were conducted at three different depths of the water
column, to study the vertical distribution of zooplankton populations and determine some physico-chemical
and biological parameters of Lago Amapá. Weekly samples were taken with a Van Dorn sampler. The species
showed greater concentrations at the by means of water column. Thirty-eight zooplankton species were found
in the samples represented by Rotifera (30), Cladocera (5) and Cyclopoida (3). The temperature of the water
column showed a tendency toward relatively high values (about 30°C) with little variation, consequently resulting
in low viscosity. Based of Jaccard‘s index, it was seen that during the low-water phase, S1 and S3 of the three
sampling stations studied, had greater similarity (C

j
 = 0.7058) in the middle of the water column. Lago Amapá

showed characteristics in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis model, favoring colonization by
opportunistic species such as rotifers.

RESUMO. O objetivo desta investigação foi observar a distribuição vertical da comunidade do zooplâncton no
Lago Amapá (10º2’36”S e 67º50’24”W), localizado na planície de inundação do Rio Acre. Amostragens foram
conduzidas em três diferentes profundidades da coluna da água, considerando aspectos sazonais do zooplâncton,
parâmetros físicos, químicos e biológicos. Coletas foram realizadas semanalmente com Garrafa de Van Dorn. As
espécies apresentaram maiores concentrações no meio da coluna da água. Foram encontradas 38 espécies, assim
distribuídas: Rotifera (30), Cladocera (5) e Cyclopoida (3). A temperatura da coluna da água em geral apresentou-
se alta, em torno de 30°C, com pequena variação, resultando em baixa viscosidade. O índice de Jaccard,
comparando-se as três estações de coletas, demonstrou que durante a fase de águas baixas, as estações 1 e 3
foram as mais similares (C

j
 = 0.7058), especialmente no meio da coluna da água. Lago Amapá apresentou

características em conformidade com o Modelo do Distúrbio Intermediário, favorecendo a colonização de
grupos oportunistas, tais como rotíferos.

with respect to two meanings, that is, referring to medium
intensity or to a disturbance that occurs with an intermediate
succesive step. Disturbance is the main determinant of com-
munity structure, with the important element of time influ-
encing the level of diversity that is established after the event.
When it is frequent, it can become a requirement of the com-
munity it creates. It is this consistency of disturbance that is at
the core of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (CONNELL
1978, REYNOLDS et al. 1993, HARPER 1978). Periodic flooding of
abandoned meander lakes, common in aquatic ecosystems in
Amazonia, are events that exemplify these perturbations that
influence the zooplanktonic communities present.

Limnologic studies, including those on vertical distribu-
tion, are still scarce. Some existing interrelations between or-
ganisms and physico-chemical parameters, considering verti-
cal distribution, have been studied by LEWIS &amp;amp; WEIBEZAHN (1976),
INFANTE (1980), and BINI et al. (2001). The existing differences in
the vertical distribution of zooplankton species are probably
determined by an interaction among physical, chemical and
biological factors, such as predation and competition.

Such studies conducted in Brazil have examined mainly
the daily variation of the floodplain of the Rio Paraná (PAES DA
SILVA &amp;amp; THOMAZ 1997). FISHER et al. (1983), in studies of Lago
Calado in Central Amazônia found microcrustaceans in the
oxygenated layer, with no evident vertical migration.

The aim of this study was to determine the patterns of
vertical distribution, taking into consideration the seasonality
of the composition of the zooplankton community, and some
abiotic variables of Lago Amapá and of the floodplain of Rio
Acre in the morning, during the main phases of the hydro-
logic cycle.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

In the areas of the Amazonia lowlands, the character of
the Andean rivers develop strong lateral incisions instead of
showing depth erosion, resulting in meandering. After pass-
ing their cones of coarse rubble, deposited when leaving the
mountainous section of their courses, the rivers carry a bot-
tom-load of sand which forms sandbanks, and their waters
become turbid, because of their load of fine suspended par-
ticles. The meanders migrate down the rivers, old ones are cut
off and transformed into oxbow lakes, and new ones are
formed. The whole land adjacent to the rivers is in a constant
and rapid process of dismantling and rebuilding, a process
which can be observed on a time scale of a few decades (SIOLI
1984).

The lake studied is environment situated in the Amazon
Basin. Lago Amapá is situated in the municipality of Rio Branco
with the geographic coordinates 10°02’36”S and 67°50’24”W
(Fig. 1). It is an affluent of the Rio Acre, characterized accord-
ing to SIOLI (1984) as a whitewater river with turbid water, more
or less ochre-colored water; this type of river is well regarded
in the pre-Andean zone as southwestern. One of the main char-

acteristics of the lakes studied is the fluctuation of the water
level, which is distinguished by two phases: high water and
low water. They are directly influenced by the hydrologic re-
gime of the Rio Acre, especially during high water periods. These
lakes are abandoned meanders. The minimum and maximum
depths for Lago Amapá are respectively 2.7 and 4.5 m.

According to SALATI et al. (1978), the hydrologic complex,
which is the Amazon basin, is formed by thousands of small
rivers and has probably been in dynamic equilibrium, together
with the exuberant forest, for millennia. The lakes studied are
situated south of the equator, beyond parallel 65°W, and re-
ceive a minimum amount of precipitation in June/July (SIOLI
1984). Lago Amapá is a lake belonging to the hydrographic
basin of the Rio Acre, to which it is permanently linked, and
thus considered a whitewater lake, according to SIOLI (1968).
The lakes are surrounded by forest, which is inundated during
high water, and as a consequence, there is a great input of
organic matter from the forest into the lake.

The data on the biotic and abiotic parameters were col-
lected at the lake generally at weekly intervals (except in Octo-
ber), during two periods comprising the the low-water phase
(dry season) between May 8, 1997 and October 30, 1997 and
the high-water phase (rainy season) between January 2, 1998
and February 24, 1998. Three stations were selected: station I –
a region located close to a canal that connects Lago Amapá
with Rio Acre; station II – an approximately central region of
the lake; station III; the terminal region of the lake.

To carry out a qualitative and quantitative analysis of
the zooplankton, 5-L aliquots were collected from each layer
(top, middle and bottom) of the water column. The zooplank-
ton organisms were collected with a Van Dorn sampling bottle,
using a conical net (55-µm mesh) to filter 15 liters of water at
the different dephts.

The samples were preserved in a solution of 4% formal-
dehyde. The determination of the physical, chemical and bio-
logical parameters, that is, water temperature (°C), transpar-
ency and depth of the water column (m), electrical conductiv-
ity (µS.cm-1), dissolved oxygen (mg.L-1) and chlorophyll-a
(µg.L-1), was according to GOLTERMAN et al. (1978), and included
a modification of the assay for dissolved oxygen using sodium
azide (GOLTERMAN et al. 1969). Alkalinity was determined by a
titrometric method according to MACKERETH et al. (1978).

The qualitative similarity between the populations of the
different collection locations was calculated using Jaccard‘s
Index (KREBS 1989) as follows: C

j
 = a/a + b + c, where C is the

index, a is the number of species present in both locations, b is
the number of species present only in location A, and c is the
number of species present only in location B. The presence of
a species in at a collection location was scored as 1, and its
absence was scored as 0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Physical and chemical parameters and their influence on
the presence of zooplankton

The hydrometric levels obtained for the Rio Acre, in ac-
cordance with the data furnished by the Civil Defense of the
Rio Branco Corp of Firemen for the period studied (low-water
phase/1997 and high-water phase/1998), remained practically
constant up to almost the end of the low-water phase. How-
ever, from October, it increased considerably up to the second
half of February in the high-water phase.

As a result of the qualitative analysis of the zooplank-
ton, 30 taxa de rotifers, five taxa of cladocers and four taxa of
copepods were found. The species of Rotifera found were:
Asplanchna brightwelli Gosse 1850; Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig,
1850); Brachionus calicyflorus Pallas, 1766; Brachionus calicyflorus
anuraeformis (Brehm, 1903); Brachionus caudatus (Barrois &amp;amp;
Daday, 1884), Brachionus dolabratus Harring, 1915; Brachionus
falcatus (Zacharias, 1898); Brachionus havanaensis Rousselet,
1911; Brachionus plicatilis (O.F. Müller, 1786), Keratella americana

(Carlin, 1943); Keratella cochlearis Gosse, 1851; Keratella
cochlearis hispida Lauterborn, 1900; Platyias quadricornis
(Ehrenberg, 1834); Epiphanes macrourus (Barrois &amp;amp; Daday, 1894);
Filinia longiseta (Ehrenberg) 1834; Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias,
1898); Filinia pjeleri (Hutchinson, 1964), Filinia terminalis Plate
1886; Hexarthra intermedia brasiliensis (Hawer, 1953); Lepadella
ovalis (O.F. Müller, 1786); Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943;
Testudinella patina (Hermann, 1783); Trichocerca similis
(Wierzejski, 1893); Trochosphaera aequatorialis Semper, 1872.
The cladocers were: Bosminopsis deitersi (Richard, 1895);
Ceriodaphnia cornuta SARS, 1886; Diaphanosoma spinulosum
Herbst, 1975; Moina minuta Hansen, 1899; Moina reticulata
(Daday, 1905); and copepod Neutrocyclops brevifurca (Lowdes,
1934). Moreover, were determined genera of species without
identification: Rotifera (6) and Copepoda (1). Also found were
juvenile forms such as nauplii, copepodites of Cyclopoida and
Calanoida, and other invertebrates such as Chaoboridae.

Among the collection stations, the most similarities,
based on zooplankton composition, were found for stations
S1 and S3 during the low-water phase (Tab. I).

S3) at La go Amapa, ta king into conside ration the diverse
compartments of the water column according to Jaccard's index,

Greater similarities occurred during the low-water phase,
by virtue of the separation of waters from Lago Amapá and the
Rio Acre. The zooplankton was found to be distributed through-
out the water column, showing a greater abundance of rotifers
during both periods, which were concentrated in the middle
and the top of the water column in the dry season, and prefer-
entially in the top layer in the rainy season (Fig. 2).

In the dry season, the zooplankton had a defined pat-
tern of distribution, clearly with a greater density in the middle
and the top of the water column, since the bottom regions of
stations 3 and 1 formed separate groups. Station 2 is calmer
than station 3 and deeper than station 1. (Fig. 2). On the other
hand, at high water, a greater distribution of organisms is seen
throughout the water column, with the exception of station

3, which is a deeper station. This distribution can be explained
by the more elevated levels of chlorophyll-a (145µg.l-1) in the
middle of the water column recorded during the low-water
phase, with the inverse occurring in the rainy season. The water
column was shown to be generally oxygenated, with lower
values at the end of the low-water phase (Tabs II and III).

The values for dissolved oxygen accompanied the tem-
perature. They were also generally high in the top layer, and at
times high values were also seen in the bottom layer, contrary
to studies conducted by PAES DA SILVA &amp;amp; THOMAZ (1997), who
found values close to zero in the bottom layer. Oxygenation
was much greater in the upper layers, permitting a propitious
habitat, as was the survival of the zooplankton populations.

The more elevated concentrations of chlorophyll-a oc-
curred in the low-water period, primarily at the end, during
which there was also an abundance of particular zooplankton
groups because of the abundance of food.

Temperature did not appear to be the cause of this distri-
bution, since it showed small variations of only 1° to 3°C dur-
ing low water, and of 0° to 1°C during high water. Similarly,
pH did not vary substantially, showing values generally in the
acid range. With regard to vertical distribution, the middle and
bottom of the water column did not show any stratification
during the course of the study.

Lago Amapá showed seasonal patterns influenced by the
elevation of the water level of the Rio Acre during the high-
water period. During this phase, there was greater transpar-
ency, concomitant with the fall in chlorophyll-a values. How-
ever, transparency accompanied proportionally the concen-
tration of dissolved oxygen. ESTEVES et al. (1994) explained that
the penetration of light to the bottom favors a high photosyn-
thetic activity throughout the water column. Temperature re-
mained nearly constant the entire period, and among the dif-

ferent water layers as well, sometimes by the fact that the lake
was calm, showing thus the absence of stratification. There
was thereby a tendency for organisms to be distributed through-
out the water column, not determining defined niches.

The pH appeared to be generally homogeneous in the
water column, while electrical conductivity was greater at the
bottom. ESTEVES et al. (1994) also observed in Lago Batata a
homogeneous pH and high values of electrical conductivity,
mainly at the bottom, due to the accumulation of ions result-
ing from the decomposition of organic material and from the
contact of the water with the sediment.

The number of zooplanktonic organisms was reduced,
at the end of the low-water phase as well as at the end of the
high-water phase, possibly due to the fluctuations in the wa-
ter level, which causes stress to the organisms.

Two species of the genus Keratella were examined in this
study. The species K. cochlearis was more abundant, and oc-
curred in the intermediate layer of the water column, which
also showed low pH values and high levels of chlorophyll-a. A
peak was shown on June 5 (during the dry season) in all three
layers of the water column. In the rainy season, the density
diminished drastically, and this species was replaced by K.
cochlearis hispida, with density peaks in the top layer (Fig. 3),
which appeared to adapt better to the changes in pH from
neutral to slightly basic during the dry season to acidic during
the rainy season, along with a reduction in chorophyll-a.

Three species of the genus Filinia were identified. F.
opoliensis and F. longiseta had two similar density peaks and
were present during all the study period, in contrast to F.
terminalis, which showed lower densities, mainly at low water.
Only one density peak was evident at high water, as of January
19, in the top and middle layers of the water column. Brachionus
falcatus, abundant in the low-water phase, was succeeded in
the high-water phase by Brachionus calicyflorus and B. calicyflorus
anuraeformis, present in all three layers, although the greater
density being seen preferentially in the top layer (Fig. 3). When
this occurred, there was also a greater electrical conductivity
during this phase.

Greater peaks for Filinia terminalis, Brachionus calicyflorus,
Brachionus calicyflorus anuraeformis and Keratella cochlearis
hispida occurred when there was greater electrical conductiv-
ity during the high-water phase, especially on January 19, 1998.

Alkalinity, pH and electrical conductivity had higher
values in the low-water than in the high-water period, which
possibly favored the presence during low water of Brachionus
falcatus, Filinia opoliensis, Filinia longiseta, Keratella cochlearis
and Moina minuta.

The density levels obtained for microcrustaceans (Cla-
docera) are shown in figure 3. Moina minuta was predominant
in the middle of the water column, mainly during the dry sea-
son, while Diaphanosoma spinulosum showed a peak in the top
layer during this phase, but was distributed among all three
layers in the rainy season.

Figure 4 describes the variation in population density
for Chaoboridae during the two main phases of the hydro-
logic cycle, where it is seen that this species occupied preferen-
tially the middle layer mainly during the dry season. The num-
ber of Chaoboridae was much greater during the low-water
phase.

Seasonal succession of zooplankton and spatial distribution
of the taxa

The results obtained in this study show that zooplank-
ton species are distributed throughout the water column, prin-
cipally during the high-water phase, with the entrance of wa-
ter from the river beginning January 19, 1998, making new

habitats, especially for some species of the more abundant ro-
tifers such as Filinia longiseta, Filinia terminalis, Keratella
cochlearis hispida, Brachionus calicyflorus and Brachionus
calicyflorus anuraeformis. In addition, in the low-water phase,
some associations are established among the taxa Brachionus
falcatus, Filinia opoliensis, Filinia longiseta and Keratella cochlearis.

Rotifers occurred in greater abundance in the top layer,
and less in the middle and bottom of the water column. In
general, they do not appear to be associated with the preda-
tion of Chaoboridae, since the number of Chaoboridae in this
layer was low in both phases of the hydrologic cycle. This study
demonstrated that predation does not play a principal role in

controlling the distribution of these species, since the number
of Chaoboridae in the middle of the water column was greater
than in top or bottom. If some organisms had been affected by
predation, they could have been the species Brachionus
calicyflorus, Brachionus calicyflorus anuraeformis, Filinia terminalis,
Keratella cochlearis hispida and Diaphanosoma spinulosum. This
would have likely involved the first stages of Chaoboridae lar-
vae, for they are more specific for rotifers.

In the high-water phase, there was a predominance of
the taxa Brachionus calyciflorus and B. calyciflorus anuraeformis,
Filinia opoliensis, Filinia terminalis and Keratella cochlearis hispida.
Of these, only Filinia opoliensis and Filinia longiseta were also
able to develop, although in smaller numbers, during the low-
water period.

With regard to the microcrustaceans, there was a greater
abundance of Moina predominating in the low-water phase,
especially in the middle of the water column, accompanying
the presence of food.

This study showed that there was a concentration in the
middle of the water column of some species of rotifers includ-
ing Brachionus falcatus, Brachionus calicyflorus, Brachionus
calicyflorus anuraeformis, Filinia opoliensis, Keratella cochlearis
hispida and of the microcrustacean Moina minuta. The pres-
ence of these species in this niche is possibly explained by the
levels of chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen, which were
shown to be relatively high. According to WILLIAMSON et al.
(1996), food specific for planktonic organisms is approximately
three times more elevated in the middle of the water column
than in the top layer.

When stratified, lakes produce compartmentalization
and a vertical gradient in the distribution of the planktonic
communities, in contrast to what was observed in Lago Amapá.
The absence of stratification and the presence of food, acting
together, explains possibly the abundance of these species in
the middle of the water column.

During the entire period studied, the levels of dissolved
oxygen showed a pronounced difference between the top and
bottom layers with the greater values being limited to the up-
per layers, explaining the absence of zooplanktonic organisms
at the bottom of the lake.

FISHER et al. (1983) observed during a 24-h cycle at Lago
Calado, that the zooplankton was stratified in relation to dis-
solved oxygen, always being in or moving toward the most
oxygenated layer during the day. LANSAC-TÔHA et al. (1992) also
noted that some calanoid cladocers and copepodites were dis-
tributed preferentially in layers where the concentration of
dissolved oxygen was more elevated.

The larvae of Chaoboridae also regulated the presence
of plankton, although to a much lesser extent compared to
the physico-chemical parameters. The numbers found dem-
onstrated the presence of a high concentration of these larvae
in the bottom followed by the middle layer of the water col-
umn. According to NEILL &amp;amp; PEACOCK (1980) apud HAVENS (1990),
rotifers are the principal source of food for the first stages of
Chaoboridae. ARCIFA (1997) reported that Chaoborus spp. have
the potential for predation during the entire year, whereby
the pressure on the plankton is diminished by the seasonal
fluctuations of the population and its vertical migration. In
the latter study, population growth during the warm-rainy sea-
son reached a level of 4 ind.L-1.

Nonetheless, in Lago Amapá a maximum of 12,000 ind.m-3

occurred, possibly influencing the presence of zooplankton,
mainly the cladocers, which are the preferred food for these
larvae.

During low water, there was blooming period for the
Cyanophyceae algae, observed by chance in great abundance
in samples, in addition to being visible to the naked eye in

Lago Amapá. The effect of blue-green algae (toxic) on the struc-
ture of zooplankton communities, influenced the distribution
of some species in this study, which migrated to the bottom of
the lake during this phase, probably in search of adequate food.

The low diversity in Lago Amapá must have been affected
by the increase in the water level, despite a fluctuation varying
at least 2 m during the whole hydrologic cycle. According to
the explanation provided by the intermediate disturbance hy-
pothesis, if the disturbances are moderate or rare, the groups
then tend toward an equilibrium and few species dominate, since
this equilibrium eliminates other species (CONNELL 1978), through
the competition for niches, food and predation. Therefore, a
moderate disturbance occurred in the environment studied here.

Various factors, such as the competition for food, preda-
tion, presence of light, and temperature, acted together to de-
termine the presence of zooplankton populations in a particu-
lar niche in the water column, whereby physical and chemical
parameters were determinants.
