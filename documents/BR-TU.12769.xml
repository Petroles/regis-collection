RESUMO 

A recessão económica de 2008 desencadeou flutuações relevantes em diversos 

âmbitos, nomeadamente na indústria automóvel. O objetivo desta dissertação é analisar 

a influência da atual crise no preço de venda dos carros em segunda mão. Para tal, foi 

estimada uma regressão linear, recorrendo ao método dos Mínimos Quadrados 

Ordinários, com base numa amostra de carros usados vendidos em Portugal, entre 2005 

e 2012. Variáveis macroeconómicas tais como a Taxa de Desemprego, o Preço do 

Petróleo, os Empréstimos concedidos a Particulares, o Indicador do Consumo Privado, 

o Índice Harmonizado de Preços no Consumidor, entre outras, foram testadas na 

regressão. Para além destas, foram incluídas variáveis que representam as próprias 

características do veículo. Por fim, foi realizada uma análise out-of-sample para testar a 

validade do modelo de regressão linear. Os resultados revelaram que algumas das 

variáveis escolhidas têm, de facto, impacto no preço de um automóvel vendido no 

mercado secundário e que, devido à sua capacidade preditiva, podem ser úteis para 

procedimentos de pricing ou apenas para avaliação de ativos.

ABSTRACT 

The 2008 economic downturn triggered significant fluctuations in several scopes, 

namely in the automotive industry. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse the 

influence of the current crisis on the sale price of second hand vehicles. A linear 

regression model was estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares procedure, based on a 

sample of used cars sold in Portugal, since 2005 to 2012. Macroeconomic variables 

such as Unemployment Rate, Oil Prices, Loans granted to Private Individuals, Private 

Consumption Indicator, Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, among others, were 

tested in the estimated regression. In addition, some variables representing the own 

vehicle characteristics were also included. Finally, an out-of-sample analysis was 

performed to evaluate the predictive ability of the linear regression model. Results 

suggested that some of the selected macroeconomic indicators actually influence the 

sale price of an automobile sold in the secondary market and due to its predicting 

capacity can be useful to pricing procedures or just for asset valuation.

1. INTRODUCTION 

After a period of a strong economic expansion across the world, the 2008 global 

economy slowdown triggered many consequences in several different scopes. The crisis 

in the financial sector restricted the access to credit and shifted the borrowing 

conditions. As a result, domestic investment and consumption demand declined, 

affecting the national production in general. 

In the majority of countries, the unemployment increased significantly which 

reduced the households’ disposable income and therefore the purchasing power. 

Consumers needed to become more rational and redefine more carefully their 

purchasing decisions, not just because of the uncertainty about future income levels but 

also because of the reduction on the economic growth expectations. 

Within this crisis environment, the automotive industry has been one of the most 

resented sectors. 

As a durable good, a car is an acquisition particularly sensitive in times of difficulties 

to access credit and when disposable income is decreasing, since it needs a certain 

money amount. When facing a period of such uncertainty, consumers can postpone the 

decision of acquiring a new car to the future when economic conditions will probably 

be more stable; instead of buying a brand new car, they can choose to purchase a second 

hand vehicle or even to sell their current car without replacing it due to the high costs 

(insurance, maintenance, fuel, among others) of owning an automobile. 

Car retailers, renting companies and other businesses related with the automobile 

industry, did not manage to create appropriate mechanisms to minimize the negative 

crisis impact. Some products continued to be overpriced, asset valuations were still 

overestimated and residual values of renting companies, for instance, were not 

calculated in the proper way. If macroeconomic factors and different scenarios were 

taken into account earlier, this issue would possibly have been addressed and computed 

with more accuracy and, even though it could bring immediate losses, the damage 

caused would probably have been lower.

Sales of New Vehicles in Portugal (in units)

In Portugal it is estimated that sales of all new vehicles dropped more than 59%, 

since 2005 to 2012 and this was one of the largest falls in car sales of European 

countries, which can be observed in appendix A. 

Figure 1 – Sales of New Vehicles in Portugal (in units)

The information available about the evolution of second hand car sales is scarce 

since it is very hard to collect accurate data about the total sales by private individuals 

and used car dealers but it would be interesting to observe whether the impact on used 

car sales was similar to the decline in new car sales.  

As previously mentioned, if by one hand the current crisis can delay consumer’s 

decision of buying a new vehicle, on the other hand it may lead the buyer to prefer 

acquiring a used car since it is a more affordable choice in times of economic 

difficulties. But does the global crisis environment influence the sale price of a used 

car? Which are the factors that better explain the variations on the average sale price in 

automobiles secondary market? Do the impacts of these factors follow the expected 

positive or negative pattern? 

Although many academic researches have compared the evolution of macroeconomic 

variables with the volume of car sales, few explored the link between the performance 

of macroeconomic factors and the automobiles sale price, especially concerning 

secondary markets. 

The aim of this dissertation is to analyse the influence of economic indicators in the 

average sale price of used cars in Portugal, from 2005 to 2012.

In order to investigate this issue, it will be estimated an econometric model to infer 

about the effect on the vehicle sale price caused not only by the car’s own 

characteristics but also by fluctuations in macroeconomic variables. The dataset used 

contains second hand cars sold by the leading company in the operational leasing and 

fleet management market in Portugal. The sample contains sales since 2005 until 2012, 

which includes the recent economic downturn. 

Regarding vehicle’s own characteristics, the brand, the body style, the vehicle kind, 

fuel type, number of doors, cylinder capacity, the list price of the vehicle when it was 

bought new, the mileage and the age, will be the variables used in the model. 

Concerning the economic environment, the macroeconomic variables that will be tested 

in the regression are: real oil prices, exchange rate, loans to private individuals, long-

term and short-term interest rates, EURIBOR, harmonized unemployment rate, sales of 

new passenger cars, harmonized index of consumer prices, economic activity coincident 

indicator, private consumption coincident indicator, economic sentiment indicator and 

consumer confidence indicator. 

Other macroeconomic variables would be interesting to test, however there were no 

monthly available data. Nonetheless, the quantity of indicators and their qualitative 

characteristics can help to conceive a reliable picture of the country’s economic 

situation. 

Since it is important to take into account that the current crisis may have relevant 

consequences not only in the volume of sales but also in the sale price of a used vehicle, 

the model estimated in this thesis can be useful to predict more accurately the car 

pricing and residual values or just for asset valuation purposes. 

The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows. Next section provides an 

overview of previous studies in related areas, such as durable goods, second hand 

markets, economic crisis and the determinants of car sales. Then, it specifies the dataset 

and the variables as well as the model and the estimation procedures used in this 

dissertation. Afterwards, it describes and analyses the model results in section 4. To 

conclude, the main results are summarized in the final section, where it is also given an 

insight about the thesis limitations and extensions to pursue in future researches.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

This section gives a brief bibliography review and aims to address the different 

research areas related to this study, in order to provide a flowed walkthrough along the 

explored topics and a further insight on the subject, thus allowing a better understanding 

of the thesis theme. 

2.1. DURABLE GOODS AND SECONDARY MARKETS 

There are some useful academic researches that can help to better understand the 

logic behind the behaviour of consumers towards durable and non-durable goods, the 

relationship between first and second hand markets as well as the main differences 

among new and used markets. 

Black and Cusbert (2010) examined cycles in spending on durable goods in Australia 

since 1960 until 2010 which included the recent economic downturn, providing a 

comparison with USA. The authors define durable goods as a flow of services or utility 

over time. On the contrary, non-durable goods and services are usually immediately 

consumed. Then they estimate the correlation between GDP and the consumption of 

different types of goods and services (see appendix B1), concluding that spending on 

durable goods is likely to be more cyclical than spending on non-durable goods and 

services since it can be more easily postponed in times of an economic slowdown. For 

instance, a household that faces a reduction in income may choose not to acquire a new 

car since one can continue to use its current car. The same does not happen when 

deciding to buy food, since this kind of purchase cannot be delayed so easily. By this 

way, consumer spending on durable goods is more volatile than spending on non-

durable goods and services, as can be seen in appendix B2. Also in this paper, we can 

find two different effects of some governments temporary subsidies targeted as 

spending on consumer durables: it reduced the price of durables relative to non-durables 

and the current price became lower regarding its future price; in addition, it boosted 

inter temporal substitution, with consumers deciding to purchase goods immediately 

rather than waiting for better future financial conditions. 

Heim (2009) developed and tested different macroeconomic consumption demand 

functions for durable goods, nondurable goods and services, using USA 1960-2000 

data. The models explain, respectively, 94%, 86% and 81% of the variance in each

one’s demand. The demand for durables, such as automobiles and home appliances, 

appeared to be driven by the disposable income, wealth, the exchange rate, availability 

of consumer credit, interest rates on consumer credit, demand for new housing and 

population growth. Regarding the demand for nondurables, like groceries and clothes, 

the model revealed to be similar to the durables model, with the exception of new 

housing demand and exchange rate variables. Finally, the demand for services like 

laundry and entertainment services proved to be influenced by the disposable income, 

wealth and population growth as well as mortgage interest rates paid by households. 

In order to understand the dependence between new and second hand markets, it is 

important to fully understand why secondary market exists. Van Cayseele (1993) 

provides a framework answering this question, by justifying it with the durability and 

the volatility of the durable. 

Goods give utility to the consumer over a number of periods. Hence, as soon as the 

consumer gets enough of it, he wants to replace the good for superior performance or to 

better serve more urgent needs. Consequently, he will try to resell the commodity. The 

author argues that secondary markets re-allocate durables from agents taking out a low 

utility, to agents that at the moment can extract a higher usefulness. If the durability of a 

good is longer, the probability for a consumer to drop the asset and decide to buy 

another one will increase in order to provide more utility. So, durability constitutes the 

first condition to the existence of second hand markets since over the time it will 

diminish the utility for some consumers. 

As a second condition, the good quality needs sufficient volatility. For instance, an 

economic depreciation could appear if the costumer has no further need of the good or 

just because of an increase on the car’s maintenance cost. If the quality of the durable 

and the user income varies throughout time, it will probably create a secondary market 

for such a good. 

As Van Cayseele (1993) but with a macroeconomic approach, Scitovsky (1994) 

explained the existence of the secondary markets by investigating its impact on the 

overall economy and probing it through Keynes approach and Say’s law. 

Consumers frequently react to a variation of their income by shifting their demand 

between new markets and secondary ones which are cheaper. For instance, owners of 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE

second hand cars are more or less prone to hold their vehicles according to the variation 

of prices. A change on income can lead to a transfer of demand from secondary markets 

to cheaper goods of new markets, and therefore accelerate the initial fall or rise in the 

incomes. Hence, when the elasticity of substitution between the durables traded in a first 

and a second hand market is relatively high, their prices turn out to be interdependent 

and a disruption of their market equilibrium can affect both their prices. Thus, 

secondary-markets usually unsettle the economy’s macro equilibrium, by stimulating or 

depressing it. 

 Therefore, second hand markets comprise two main roles: it mitigates the 

inequalities by allowing poorest individuals to buy cheaper commodities whilst it 

stimulates the economy by facilitating the replacement of obsolete durable goods. 

In the short term, an effect in one of the markets generates a temporary obstacle to a 

price change and triggers a movement on the other market in the same direction. On a 

subsequent period, the used market’s disequilibrium slowly releases the restrictions to 

an equilibrating price modification. The result depends on the size of the second hand 

market and it becomes more significant in countries with high standard of living. 

Concerning the difference in the quality of new and used markets, Akerlof (1970) 

developed the lemons model. An automobile may have a good or a bad quality (which 

in America is called as “lemons”) and initially a buyer knows that with probability q it 

is a good car and with probability (1-q) it is a lemon. Nevertheless, cars of different 

qualities have been selling at a common price since it is impossible to distinguish one 

from another. Buyers tend to look for statistics to judge and to get more information 

about the quality of prospective purchases but only the seller knows the difference. 

Hereupon, there is an incentive for sellers to supply poor quality durables and, as a 

result, there tends to exist a reduction of the average quality of goods, which implies a 

price adjustment. 

 So, the lemons model basically assumes that owners of used cars have an 

informational advantage over potential buyers with respect to the quality of their 

vehicles. Consequently, the average quality of traded automobiles is thus lower than the 

average quality of the whole population of cars, which suggests that bad used cars drive 

out the good ones of the market because they sell at an equal price to good cars.

With these conclusions, Akerlof explains why used cars valuation is so much lower 

than new cars valuation since there is a significant lack of perfect information among 

dealers and consumers and he also explains why this quality uncertainty may lead to 

significant economic costs of dishonesty. 

In response to the lemons model, leasing automobiles and Certified Pre-Owned 

(CPO) programs can help to lighten the costs of asymmetric information about the 

quality uncertainty of second hand durable goods. Sultan (2010) examined the possible 

impacts of these both solutions to the lemons problem and his results reveal that leasing 

and CPO cars actually supply good quality used cars to the market and improve 

substantially the info mechanism between sellers and buyers, reducing the adverse 

selection. 

The substitution of commodities is commonly made among primary and secondary 

markets. Prado (2009) aimed to analyze its interdependence on a macroeconomic 

perspective, in France, UK and USA. The author also tried to check the accuracy of the 

following mechanisms (2009: 10):  

“The new market feeds the used market” – Past new markets may be 

positively correlated with today’s second hand car market, regarding volume and 

prices. 

“Renewals”– Drivers have to renew their automobiles after some years, 

which may create cycles on both markets. 

“Volume effect” – An increase in transaction volumes caused by the supply 

side could lower the price. If an increase in transaction volumes is caused by a 

greater demand, it could higher the prices. 

“Price effect” – A price increase could negatively impact the demand side, 

and could either have a positive impact on supply side 

“Arbitration” – A buyer can purchase a car on the new market or on the used 

market, but a car cannot be bought on both markets at the same time. 

“Reallocation” – Since high prices in new cars lead buyers to move to the 

second hand market, the used car prices increase as well. In the short term, 

volume and prices move in the same direction in both markets. 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE

“Income Effect” – A decline of income reduces the demand, the transaction 

volumes and by this way the prices go down in both markets. On the other hand, 

it could shift consumption from new to the used market. 

Results can be seen in appendix C and the main conclusion is that the interrelations 

between both markets are not strong enough to entirely explain patterns but in some 

way the used market of the present is linked to the new market of the past, not just 

through volumes but also through prices. It is also highlighted that interactions differ in 

the three countries studied according to a short-term or a long-term perspective but it 

does experience rigidity of both used car volumes of transactions and new car prices. 

Pashigian (2001) observed that USA used car prices index has much more volatility 

than new car prices index. The author believes that while the new cars price volatility 

has been lowering through decades, the decline for used cars has been imperceptible 

regarding the updates in car price index, despite the fact that used cars prices are the 

more volatile in the Consumer Prices Index. 

Second hand automobile markets tended to have less elastic supply curves and to 

face larger demand shocks compared to those noticed in the first hand cars market and 

other durable goods markets. 

 

Figure 2 – New and Used Car Price Volatility Caused by demand Shifts

The correlation found between annual price ratio for used cars and the annual price 

ratio for new cars was 0.3, which indicates that a raise in the demand for first-hand cars 

is positively related with an increase in the demand for second hand cars.

Although there has been a significant amount of academic researches on the subject 

of durable goods, there are still many questions regarding the existence and organization 

of secondary markets. 

2.2. ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY 

There is a long-standing literature investigating the impact of the current economic 

crisis on the automobile industry. Over the last years, consumers and companies were 

forced to respectively rethink their patterns of standard of living and their strategies in a 

context of a new and a more adverse financial and economic environment. 

Using historical data on currency crisis across the world, Dutt and Padmanabhan 

(2010) analysed the consumer’s response to crisis and points out compelling patterns in 

consumer behaviour. When experiencing a crisis, the consumer behaviour is defined by 

a consumption smoothing at different levels (inter-temporal, inter-category and intra-

category) which by turn reallocate consumption expenses. The authors find out that a 

crisis main immediate impact is on consumption indicators and the effect persists longer 

in developing economies when compared to developed economies. They also find that 

consumption expenditure declines more than income in more than 70% of developing 

countries. Considering both economies, examining the decline in expenses in the year of 

the worldwide crisis, on average, the consumption decreased 20% in durable goods, 

14,5% in services, 9,5% in semi-durables and a 7% in non-durables. Once more, this 

leads us to the conclusion that income elasticity of demand is the highest for durables 

and the lowest for non-durables. 

Within this crisis environment, the automotive industry has been also experiencing a 

downturn. Sturgeon and Van Biesebroeck (2010) stated that with the crisis, the credit 

market froze and consequently orders were cancelled, the suppliers didn’t receive their 

payments and many plants were forced to shut down, at least temporarily. The debt 

increased dramatically, the labour costs and fixed-capital costs also became higher, and 

pension and health care plans turned the situation even worse. Since the automobile 

market is more expensive and with a growing longevity, buyers in a crisis period tend to 

postpone their purchases, which they would probably have made within better economic 

conditions. As the authors mentioned (2010: 6), “Consumers, especially in the world's 

largest national passenger vehicle market, the United States, found it difficult to obtain 

loans for purchase and, driven by fear of job loss, moved aggressively to increase their

rate of saving. Vehicle sales plunged and as a result, beginning in the fall of 2008, 

pushing the industry into its most severe crisis since the Great Depression.” 

Haugh, Mourougane and Chatal (2010) also studied the consequences of the 

financial crisis in the automobile industry, analyses the evolution through time in 

different regions and makes a comparison between some countries. 

Using econometric estimations, they find out that the current credit constraints could 

explain more than 80% of the downfall in automobile sales at the end of 2008 in Canada 

and in USA. The difficulties in accessing to credit led numerous households to delay 

their car purchases, which in turn resulted in a sharp decline of demand and, 

consequently, in an excess of the production capacity in major car manufacturers’ 

countries. Hereupon, the authors make some projections (2010:2):  

“While a rebound in car sales is likely in North America, Japan and the United 

Kingdom, car sales in Germany have been pushed significantly above trend and may 

weaken going forward. Over the medium term, in mature markets such as Europe and 

North America, trend sales are likely to remain stagnant. By contrast, rapid increases 

are foreseen in China and to a lesser extent in India” (see appendix D). 

The authors also show a strong correlation between private consumption and car 

sales and, when comparing to other countries, Portugal is the third with the highest 

correlation coefficient, after USA and Denmark.

And, although Portugal appears to have a medium/low GDP per capita, the country 

is still on the Top 5 of the countries with the largest number of cars per 1000 inhabitants

2.3. DETERMINANTS OF AUTOMOBILE SALES 

Based on the review of researches, several factors have been recognized as 

influencing car sales, such as the fluctuation in fuel prices, the disposable income and 

the unemployment rate variations, the new constraints to credit availability, among 

other issues of concern. 

Heim (2008) checked econometrically the relative influence of diverse variables in 

the consumption function, using USA data from 1960 to 2000. He comes to the 

conclusion that the current income is undoubtedly the main determinant of 

consumption, explaining 68% of its variance, followed by a crowd-out variable (14%) - 

that measures the effect of government deficits on the availability of consumer credit - , 

wealth (5%), consumer interest rates (2%) and exchange rate changes (1%). The author 

also compares Keynes to the Friedman/Modigliani hypotheses of consumption function. 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

12 

 

While Keynes argued that the demand for goods and services was basically determined 

by current income and possibly, with smaller effects, by wealth, interest rates, taxes and 

potential savings; Friedman/Modigliani developed the Permanent Income/Life Cycle 

Hypotheses, where the desire to keep rationally constant living standards influences the 

consumption function, since it relies on current income (as Keynes defended), as well as 

on a person’s sense of what their annual average income will be over a longer time 

horizon. Heim accomplishes that the majority of the fluctuation in consumption is 

linked with the current income but that the Permanent Income/Life Cycle hypotheses 

also helps to explain an additional, albeit a minor part of consumer behaviour. 

Cruceru and Micuda (2010) drove an analysis of the linkage between lending and the 

volume of cars sold. To acquire durable goods, such as automobiles, the consumer 

needs to resort to a certain amount of income, which may arise from the salaries they 

currently earn or from previously accumulated wealth. Using a Pearson correlation 

coefficient, they note that since 2009, due to job uncertainty and the decreasing of 

revenues, buyers turned less to credit. In this paper, we can also find a comparison of 

the correlation between bank loans and car registrations of different brands, which leads 

them to conclude that the cars with lower prices are more accessible to low and medium 

income consumers, who finance their car purchases with credit. By contrast, more 

expensive or luxury cars were bought with cash by customers with high financial 

resources. 

Gasoline prices are also one of the major factors influencing the decision-making of 

acquiring a vehicle. Busse, Knittel and Zettelmeyer (2009) investigated whether 

customers have adjusted to its variations by changing their car purchases not only 

regarding new and used markets, but also in the prices they pay. As an example, a 

common driver at early-1999 spent around $758 per year on gasoline and at mid-2008 

the same driver would have had to spend up to $ 2968 to travel the same distance in the 

same car.  

Since automobiles are durable goods, potential consumers must take into account not 

only the initial cost of purchasing a car but also the ongoing costs of using the car and 

since fuel is one of the largest costs of owning an automobile, it is expectable to be one 

of the most important determinants in the decision making of acquiring a new one. 

Consumers can also adjust these usage cost variations by taking advantage of the variety 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

13 

 

in fuel efficiency of available vehicles. For instance, the authors found that a $1 increase 

in gasoline prices changes the market share of the most fuel-efficient type of new cars in 

+20% and of the least fuel-efficient cars in -24%, while on the other hand, the same 

increase in gasoline prices changes the market shares of the most and the least fuel-

efficient used cars in +3% and -7%, respectively.  

The main conclusion of the paper is that changes in usage costs result in larger 

market changes than price variations regarding new car markets, while in the used car 

market, the adjustment is primarily made and larger in prices. Thus, it is expected that, 

in response to fuel price changes, sellers of used cars adjust its price and dealers of new 

cars choose not to change prices, and experience market share changes instead. 

It was very hard to find researches about the influence of different vehicle 

characteristics on used car pricing. Shing (2002) investigated it, as well as depreciation. 

The author computed three different econometric models to test the effects of the 

variables and results showed that both age and mileage caused the value of a car to 

deteriorate, while original price, horse power and the global origin of the vehicle 

contributed positively. 

Since, average quality of new passenger cars in the Portuguese market is growing at 

a fast pace and that this phenomenon has to be considered in the estimation of price 

indexes, Reis and Silva (2002) examined the effects of quality change on the price index 

for new passenger cars in Portugal since 1997 to 2001. Results revealed that the quality 

of new cars sold in Portugal during the period studied improved on average 4.8 per cent 

per year and that the overall CPI may have been overestimated by about 0.15 percentage 

points per year, which led the authors to suggest the price indexes to be regularly 

updated since the alterations on the quality of such goods are clearly growing. 

An estimation of hedonic prices was also made for cars in Spain (Matas and 

Raymond, 2009), addressing the instability of coefficients over time. According to the 

authors, despite car prices index deflated car prices between 1981 and 2005, real car 

prices fell by 40%, once quality improvements were taken into account in the research. 

In order to solve the limitation of the instability of the coefficients, which can be found 

in the majority of other regressions, two alternative estimation procedures were 

proposed: one based on a moving sample of observations and the other based on 

moving average of estimation coefficients in single period equations.

There are also many other factors that can influence a car purchasing decision, which 

are not so visible, such as information availability to consumers, promotional 

environments and a customer’s trade-in (Zeng, Dasgupta and Weinberg, 2012). This 

research showed that consumers who used the Internet to search for a good and those 

that were offered a manufacturer rebate saved, on average, $481 and $2,126, 

respectively. Also, consumers who traded-in their old automobiles ended up paying, on 

average, $159 more on the new car than consumers who did not trade-in. Another 

interesting result is that the higher the bargainers’ ability, the more price reductions they 

will achieve since they have greater tendency to search for price information and thus 

are better at identifying suppliers that offer a lower initial price. 

But, as expectable, each variable can have a different impact on the average price 

and on volume car sales depending upon the country we are studying. Smusin and 

Makayeva (2009) studied the relationship between ten macroeconomic variables and 

national car sales based on a sampling from three different countries namely Belarus, 

Russia and Ukraine. With basic instruments like correlation and the observation of 

theoretical hypotheses tested with linear regressions, they find that real estate prices are 

the most strongly correlated variable with car sales. The R² of the different models 

shows that a great portion of car sales fluctuations can be explained by macroeconomic 

fluctuations - R² values were calculated to be 83%, 84% and 75% for Belarus, Russia 

and Ukraine, respectively. A similar study was made by Muhammad, Hussin and Razak 

(2012), for five Asian countries: Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and 

Indonesia. Results showed that GDP, inflation, unemployment rate and loan rate have 

significant long term correlation with automobile sales and that each country is 

influenced by different variables in the short term period. Thus, they suggested financial 

and fiscal policies to prevent such an impact since the sales rate in the automotive sector 

is one of the most important reference to economic growth in any particular country. 

Regarding Portuguese automobile sales, Monteiro and Moutinho (2010) analysed its 

evolution using a database of 24 years and estimating an econometric model with eleven 

different variables, such as population, GDP, household disposable income, consumer 

confidence indicator, unemployment rate, inflation rate, interest rate, fuel prices, VAT 

rate, loans to firms and rewards to deliver the old car. The authors concluded that there 

was no statistical evidence about the relationship between car sales and the economic 

environment. Only inflation rate, unemployment and household disposable income

proved to be statistically relevant. Yet, the factors that influenced automobile sales 

tended to be different for each vehicle kind, except the unemployment rate and the oil 

prices, which influenced car sales in every type of automobiles.

3. METHODOLOGY 

This section describes the main features of the cross-section data employed in this 

thesis, as well as the treatment applied in order to make it more manageable and to get a 

more standard sample. Moreover, it is also referred the statistical methods used to 

construct a linear regression model and the tests applied in order to investigate the 

hypotheses of macroeconomic variables impacting on the sale price of a used car. 

3.1. DATA SOURCES AND DATA TREATMENT 

The dataset used in this dissertation contains vehicles sold by LeasePlan Portugal, in 

the secondary-market during January 2005 until December 2012. The data was kindly 

provided by the company, a global fleet and vehicle management enterprise which sells 

its cars at the end of the renting car contract. 

The automobiles included in this sample are only the vehicles sold as a common 

second hand car. The cars bought with the buyback option for the driver were not 

included. Despite this, firstly it is better to take into account that some of the vehicles 

were sold through different types of channels, such as in a B2B or a B2C approach, in 

auctions, among others, which may have an impact on the average sales price. 

Secondly, a large part of the cars is sold with only a few years of usage. If by one hand 

consumers suspect that vehicles being sold with short ages can be due to the bad quality 

of the car (Akerlof, 1970), on the other hand, they may not have the same felling about 

short age cars when sold by a renting car company because they know that it happens 

only due to the end of the vehicle’s contract and, consequently consumers can be more 

disposed to pay a higher price for the automobile. Finally, LeasePlan Portugal offers a 

two-year warranty, which can positively influence the price that the buyer is willing to 

pay, as well. However, the average prices of the automobiles are similar to the ones sold 

in the usual secondary market and to its market value indicator. 

The initial number of observations was 70,605. Due to the lack of information for 

certain variables, a few cars were excluded from the dataset, ending up with 69,810. A 

subsample was randomly selected with the purpose of testing afterwards the predictive 

ability of the model, representing less than 10% of the total observations. 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

17 

 

For every observation, information is available about the vehicle characteristics, for 

instance, the model of the car, the extras value, the registration and the sale date as well 

as the sale price (excluding VAT), among many other features. In the next subsection 

the reader can find the variables chosen for the model to evaluate the impact of the own 

nature of the car on its sale price. 

 Regarding the external forces that could also have impact on the sale price, several 

economic and financial variables were collected, in the majority from the websites of 

the Portuguese national bank, the Portuguese automobile association (ACAP), Eurostat, 

OECD and the European Central Bank.  

For each vehicle in the sample it was assigned the respectively value of the different 

macroeconomic variables, according to the date that the car was sold. 

3.2. VARIABLES DESCRIPTION 

The variables selected to test in the regression model were mainly divided by the 

information that represents the specific characteristics of the own car and by the values 

of macroeconomic factors at the date of sale of the car. 

3.2.1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OWN VEHICLE 

When considering what car to buy, there are many aspects to consider in the 

decision-making process. 

 One that has very impact on this decision is the Brand that the consumer prefers and 

that one can afford. The different trademarks of the cars represented in the dataset used 

in this thesis can be found in Table 1.

The Body Style is another issue that is very relevant in the buyer’s choice. A 

customer may want to buy a cabriolet car to meet his personal preferences or a minivan 

to better fit the family needs. He can also wish to buy a small van, for instance, to fulfill 

the needs of his company. 

Hereupon, the Vehicle Kind also varies between distinct vehicles inasmuch as the 

sale price of a passenger car is certainly different from a commercial car. Other aspects 

to take into account are: the Fuel Type, since a diesel automobile is more expensive 

than a gasoline vehicle; the Number of Doors because usually a car with three doors, in 

Portugal, has less demand than a car with five doors, for instance; and also a car with 

low Cylinder Capacity is cheaper than one with a higher.  

Another variable used in the regression model was the car List Price, which is the 

price of the automobile when sold for the first time by the manufacturer to the buyers, 

including the base price, the price of the options (extras in the vehicle such as leather 

upholstery, parking sensors, etc.) and the tax on vehicle charged at the moment of the 

acquisition. The List Price does not include the VAT. 

Since the purpose is to analyse the price variations of used cars, it is also relevant to 

consider depreciation variables such as Mileage (in kilometres) and Age (in months), at 

the moment of the vehicle sale. Regarding the mileage, the values were all divided by 

1,000 in order to reduce the scale of the variable, when compared with other ones. 

Concerning the automobile’s age, since the devaluation of the car is greater during its 

first years and smaller when the car has already a higher age, the natural logarithm of 

this variable was computed and used in the model because the depreciation of the 

vehicle regarding its age does not seem to be linear. 

The color of the vehicle would also be interesting to include in the regression because 

the demand varies according to the different colors (for instance, black or grey cars have 

more demand than yellow cars). Therefore, there was not standard information in the 

sample. 

Another interesting variable would be the vehicle’s model life-cycle, in other words, it 

describes whether the car is a facelift of its model or if it was sold before another new 

version, but it was also not possible to include it in the regression due to the lack of 

information.

3.2.2. MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES 

There were some difficulties when finding macroeconomic variables with daily and 

monthly frequency since a large part are calculated quarterly and annually, which would 

not be the desirable for this dissertation since the length of the period represented in the 

sample (2005-2012) is not so wide to create a significant variation in the variables. It 

was also challenging to choose the most representative variables of the current 

conjecture since there are several and also because the majority of them influence each 

other or indirectly represent the same issue. 

Concerning the monthly data, for each observation it was assigned the correspondent 

value to the month of the date of sale and, regarding the daily data, it was assigned the 

day in which the car was sold. Vehicles that were sold at the weekend or in day holidays 

received the previous working day available value. 

As mentioned in Busse et al. (2009), one of the larger costs when operating a car is 

the fuel, which makes it an important issue to take into account when deciding to own 

one. Hereupon, the variable real oil prices was selected to reflect its variations.  The 

higher the oil price, the lower will be the car sales price since consumers will look for 

less expensive ways of transportation, which will consequently decrease the demand of 

automobiles. This indicator is represented by the Europe Brent Spot Price (in dollars per 

barrel). 

Another obstacle that has been imposed when making the decision of buying a car is 

the decreasing access to credit. Most of the automobiles in Portugal are bought with 

loans granted to private individuals whereby the lower the availability of credit to 

finance the vehicle’s purchase, the lower will be the demand as well as the sale price of 

automobiles. The values represent the annual growth rate of loans granted to households 

by other monetary financial institutions, in Portugal.  

With the same rationale, the higher the long-term or the short-term interest rates 

as well as the three months EURIBOR, the more expensive will be resorting to credit 

which in turn also impact negatively on the sale price. 

With the global financial crisis, the unemployment rate also increased significantly, 

reducing the disposable income of households and their purchasing power. By this way, 

consumers delay even more a possible acquisition of a car. 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

20 

 

The reduction of the purchasing power might have influenced not only the demand of 

used cars but especially the volume of new automobile sales. New vehicles are clearly 

more expensive than used ones and if a buyer does not hold conditions to buy a brand 

new car, he can choose between keep using the car that he already owns or to purchase a 

car in the second hand market. Therefore, this thesis also tests the impact of the 

downturn on sales of new vehicles in the price of the cars sold in the Portuguese 

secondary market. In order to keep it simpler and because the majority of the vehicles in 

the dataset are passenger cars, only the value of new passenger automobiles are included 

in the regression model. 

Additional economic indexes such as the Economic Activity, the Private 

Consumption Coincident Indicator, the Consumer Confidence and the Economic 

Sentiment Indicators may also influence the evolution of the average sale price of used 

automobiles, in a positive way if they increase or negatively if they decline. 

The global harmonized index of consumer prices can have two counteracting 

effects: on the one hand the rise of prices in an economy also includes the increase of 

car prices and the inflation often coincides with the rising of average wages and, 

consequently, the purchasing power of consumers; on the other hand, if global prices 

increase, the demand can decrease and, as a result, the car sale price tend to decline. 

Thus, the inflation is probably one of the less clear intuitive effects on vehicle prices. 

Another variable that does not have a very intuitive effect regarding used cars is the 

exchange rate. If the foreign currency depreciates in relation to the domestic currency, 

imported cars will also become cheaper (although a large portion is usually bought in 

countries with the same currency as Portugal). Thus, the demand for new cars will raise 

and probably the demand for used cars will decrease, lowering its average sale price. On 

the other hand, the higher the value of the Euro, the greater will be the power 

purchasing to acquire raw materials, such as oil. By this way, fuel becomes more 

affordable and automobile’s demand raise, thereby increasing the average sale price, 

even of used vehicles.  

Other variables such as disposable income, gross domestic product, private 

consumption, tax burden, purchasing power and saving rates of households would be 

also interesting to include in the model, despite some of them are related to each other, 

but there were not daily nor even monthly information available. 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

21 

 

It is expected that some of the aforementioned selected variables to test will 

eventually be excluded from the regression, since they probably influence each other or 

even because they basically explain the same issue, leading to multicollinearity 

problems. 

In appendix E, the reader can find the frequency, the units, the expected signs as well 

as the sources of each macroeconomic variable selected to test in the regression and can 

also find some graphics about its evolution since 2005 until 2012, in appendix F. 

3.3. THE MODEL AND THE ESTIMATION PROCEDURE 

In order to examine which variables may have influenced the variations in the sale 

price of used automobiles from 2005 to 2012 in Portugal, it was considered a linear 

regression model, where the dependent variable was the sale price of the used car. 

The model is presented as follows:  

SPi = ?0 + ?1LPi + ?2 ALFAROMEOi + … + ?37VWi + ?38MILEAGEi + ?39 LOG (AGEi) +

Initially the model was estimated in SPSS using the stepwise procedure, in order to 

determine which of the variables explained the most variation of the dependent variable 

and also to obtain multicollinearity diagnostics. Thereafter, without the variables whose 

estimated coefficients are not statistically significant and the variables excluded because 

of the possible aforementioned problems, the regression was estimated in EViews, by 

the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, to detect and to test other problems related 

with errors of the model, specially the heteroskedasticity. 

Also, in order to identify possible outliers when analysing the OLS regression 

residuals, the following criterion was applied: the observations whose residual absolute 

value was higher than three standard deviations were excluded from the estimation 

process. 

Having the regression procedures finalized, certain out-of-sample analyses were 

made with the purpose of testing the performance of the regression. The results of the 

econometric model, the tests procedures and the out-of-sample analysis can be found in 

the next section.

4. RESULTS 

In this section the estimation procedure and the econometric tests will be described 

almost step-by-step and the results obtained will be revealed. Also, the out-of-sample 

results will be analysed in order to conclude about the predictive ability of the estimated 

regression.  

4.1. ECONOMETRIC TESTING PROCEDURE 

As described in the previous section, it was used a criterion to exclude some outliers 

based on the absolute value of residuals since it could bias or distort the OLS estimates. 

The impact of this decision in the estimation results can be observed in appendix G. 

Only a few outliers were identified and the model was estimated with the suspected 

outliers excluded. 

When using the stepwise method in SPSS there was evidence of multicollinearity 

problems, as expected, which means that one or more predictor variables in the 

regression were highly correlated. Hence, the explanatory variables Economic 

Sentiment Indicator, Short-term Interest Rate, Three Months EURIBOR, Harmonized 

Index of Consumer Prices, Private Consumption Coincident Indicator and Harmonized 

Unemployment Rate have been excluded from the regression due to its statistically 

insignificance or due to multicollinearity problems. 

After the estimation procedure in SPSS, the regression was also estimated in EViews 

in order to perform other statistical specification tests
1
. 

The result of the White test showed that there was evidence of heteroskedasticity, 

which means that we cannot assume the constant variance for the errors, given the 

explanatory variables. Hence, despite heteroskedasticity does not cause bias or 

inconsistency in the OLS estimators, the usual OLS standard errors were no longer valid 

for constructing confidence intervals and statistics such as t, F or LM, even though we 

are dealing with a large sample size.

 Due to the data cross section nature, autocorrelation tests were not performed.

To handle this problem, the regression was reestimated with White’s 

heteroskedasticity robust standard errors which allow us to resort to the usual statistical 

inferences regardless of the absence of homoskedasticity.  

4.2. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS 

After estimating the model both in SPSS and in EViews with the aim of diagnosing 

possible problems such as multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity, the linear regression 

and its output was prepared to be analysed. 

The coefficient of determination, is quite high (R² = 0.925823), which means that, 

for this sample, the explanatory variables included in the model explain almost 92,6% 

of the total variation in a used car sale price and only 7,4% of the variation of dependent 

variable is not explained in the regression. Thus, the independent variables selected for 

the regression are actually good predictors of second hand car prices. The adjusted R-

squared is also very similar (  ² = 0.925758) to the R². 

The output with the model estimated coefficients can be observed in Table 3.

As one can notice, results suggest that all the estimated coefficients associated to 

explanatory variables that represented the vehicle’s own characteristics are statistical 

significant for a 5% significance level.  

The dummies’ estimated coefficients can be interpreted as follows: on average, if the 

used car is a commercial vehicle, it is expected to worth approximately less €1824.12 

than a passenger car as well as if the automobile’s fuel type is diesel it is estimated to 

worth around €2057.63 more, on average, than a gasoline car. 

Regarding quantitative variables, the linear functional form was estimated. 

Its interpretation should be made as, for instance, if the car List Price increases 

€1000, the expected variation on the sale price of the used car will be approximately 

€302.24, on average, if everything else remain constant. The same happens with the 

automobile’s mileage: on average, the used car sale price is expected to decrease around 

€168.24 per each 10,000 miles driven, ceteris paribus. Regarding the age, since the 

variable was assessed with the natural logarithm, its interpretation should be as follows: 

if the vehicle’s age (in months) increases 1%, the car sale price is expected to decrease 

around €26.44, on average, if all the rest remain constant. 

Just for the sake of curiosity, some descriptive statistics of the quantitative variables 

representing the own vehicle’s features can be found in the following table: 

Table 4 – Descriptive statistics of some explanatory variables, concerning the vehicle’s own characteristics 

    Source: the author. 

The macroeconomic factors that at the end showed to have influence on the used car 

sale price were: Real Oil Prices; Loans granted to Private Individuals; Long-term 

Interest Rates; Sales of New Passenger Vehicles; Economic Activity Coincident 

Indicator; Consumer Confidence Indicator; and, finally, Exchange Rate. All the 

variables assumed the initially expected signs and the Exchange Rate, which seemed to 

be less intuitive, assumed a positive sign which means that, on average, the higher the 

exchange rate, the higher will be the sale price of a used car.

The interpretation of the macroeconomic variables coefficients estimated in the 

regression should be also made according to the way it was previously described. In 

other words, if the price of the barrel imported to European countries increases $1, the 

used car sale price is estimated to decline €8.47, on average, ceteris paribus, as well as 

if Consumer Confidence Indicator raises by one unit, the dependent variable is expected 

to increase, on average, €14.83, if all the rest remain constant. By the same way, the 

expected variation on the used car sale price in response to more 10,000 new passenger 

vehicles sales, is a reduction of approximately €44.15, on average, if everything else 

remain constant. If long-term interest rates raise one unit, the second hand car sale price 

is expected to decrease, on average, €26.86, ceteris paribus, for instance. 

Other variables such as Economic Sentiment Indicator, Short-term Interest Rate, 

three months EURIBOR, Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, Private Consumption 

Coincident Indicator and Harmonized Unemployment Rate were dropped from the 

regression, because they proved to have multicollinearity problems, as previously 

expected.  

4.3. OUT-OF-SAMPLE ANALYSIS 

As previously mentioned, 6,810 vehicles were randomly selected and removed from 

the initial sample in order to further test the regression model proposed in this 

dissertation. This out-of-sample include automobiles with sale dates spread over the 

years from 2005 to 2012 and almost all the different Brands and Body Styles used in the 

estimated model. 

For each used car in the out-of-sample, the predicted sale price was computed using 

the estimated regression and then this result was compared with the sale price actually 

observed. Also, some measures based on prediction errors were computed in order to 

investigate the predictive capacity of the estimated model. 

 The mean error result was -27.00895, which means that the predicted values are 

somewhat biased because the estimated values of the sale price are higher in €27.01, on 

average, than the observed values. This difference is very small taking into account the 

independent variable scale. But, since the errors tend to nullify each other (some are 

negative and other are positive), other adjusted measures were calculated with the 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

28 

 

purpose of better evaluating the closeness between the predicted values and the values 

actually observed. 

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) gives an insight of the weight of the 

errors percentage and is given by: 

      
 

        

  

 
   

 
 

where   and    represents the observed values and the estimated values of the 

dependent variable, respectively. Its result was 13.65%, which leads to the conclusion 

that, taking into account that the sample size is large, the weight of the percentage errors 

is small. 

 Another performance measure used was Theil’s inquality coefficient, also known as 

Theil's U, was computed as follows: 

  
 

 

 
         

  
   

 
 

 
   

  
 

 
    

  
   

 
   

, 

The obtained result was U = 0.1016. The Theil's U statistic is bounded between 0 and 

1 where the more accurate the forecasts, the lower will be the value of the U statistic. 

Since the result is low and the value is closer to zero, the adjustment between the 

observed and the estimated values is quite good. 

The following formulas were also computed:

Where       ,   and   are respectively the sample means and standard-deviation of 

  and     and   represents the linear correlation coefficient between the observed and the 

estimated values. 

The value of U
M

 measures systematic errors and if a high value is observed (greater 

than 0.1 or 0.2), this means that there is a systematic bias. Since the U
M

 result, regarding 

the out-of-sample, is 0.0003 it leads us to conclude that there is no evidence of 

systematic errors in the difference between the observed and the estimated values. 

U
S
 provides an insight about the difference between the standard deviations among 

the observed and the estimated values. The value obtained was 0.025. If the result was 

high, it would mean a greater variability between each series, explaining a large portion 

of the inequality between the values. 

U
C 

measures the unsystematic error and the lower the correlation coefficient between 

the observed and the estimated values, the higher will be U
C
. The result of U

C 
was 

0.975. 

The ideal allocation of inequality among these three measures would be U
M

= U
S
 = 0 

and U
C
= 1. As one can see, despite the results obtained are not perfect, its values seem 

to be good, which can lead us to conclude that the estimated regression has a certain 

predictive capacity and a somewhat forecasting accuracy.

5. DISCUSSION 

5.1. MAIN CONCLUSIONS 

In a context of a global economic and financial crisis, many macroeconomic factors 

have taken a different course: the difficulties felt in the banking system tightened the 

access to credit not only for private individuals but also for companies; the majority of 

consumers had to reconsider their consumption habits and to reallocate their income and 

expenditures in order to maximize their benefits; national production resented and 

generated a high unemployment level; among many other aspects. 

Specifically, the automobile industry in Portugal suffered many consequences and 

registered a fall of more than 59% regarding the Portuguese new vehicles sales, from 

2005 until 2012. When facing such a stressful financial situation, the buyer can decide 

to postpone its new car purchasing or can even prefer to buy a car in the secondary 

market instead of acquiring a brand new car. Therefore, if by one hand the sale of new 

automobiles fell significantly, on the other hand sales of used cars may have benefited 

from it. 

The purpose of this thesis was to examine the impact of the current economic 

environment on the sale price of second hand vehicles sold in Portugal, since 2005 to 

2012. In order to achieve this goal, a linear regression model was estimated using OLS 

procedures and this estimation was based on a sample of used cars sold by the major 

Portuguese renting company. The regression was comprised with the own 

characteristics of the vehicle (such as Brand, Body Style, Cylinder Capacity, Age at 

sale, Fuel Type, etc.) and with some macroeconomic variables. The dependent variable 

was the used car sale price. 

Results suggest that not only the vehicle’s own features are statistically significant, 

but there is also evidence that macroeconomic factors actually have impact on the 

dependent variable. Variables such as Real Oil Prices, Exchange Rate, Long-term 

Interest Rates, Loans granted to Private Individuals, Economic Activity Coincident 

Indicator, Consumer Confidence Indicator and Sales of New Passenger Vehicles proved 

to influence used automobile sale price and all of them assumed the expected signs. 

An out-of-sample was used to analyse the predicting capacity of the estimated 

regression and some measures based on prediction errors were computed in order to 



THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE USED CARS SALE PRICE 

31 

 

evaluate this issue. Even though results are not perfect, they seem to be good, which can 

lead to conclude that the estimated model has a relevant predictive capacity and a 

somewhat forecasting accuracy. 

 

The conclusion of the research is that in fact macroeconomic variables may have 

influence on the sale price of a second hand vehicle and an econometric model 

comprised with the car’s own characteristics and macroeconomic variables can have a 

great predictive capacity, which may be useful to pricing purposes or just for asset 

valuation. 

5.2. LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCHES 

One of the major limitations of the thesis was the difficult access to macroeconomic 

variables. Other factors such as the households’ disposable income, the saving rates and 

the tax burden, for instance, would also be interesting to test in the regression model but 

they were not all available mainly because they are just computed quarterly or even 

annually. The data available about second hand cars in Portugal is also scarce and 

restricted.  

At the predictive level, there are no available forecasts for the values of the 

macroeconomic variables included in the regression which constraints the predictive 

capacity of the model for the future. One possible solution is to conceive three different 

scenarios: one optimistic, one pessimistic and one somewhat in the middle. 

Another limitation was the fact that there may be a lag between the variables time 

and the moment that the buyer actually takes its values into consideration. Many times, 

consumers (households or companies) do not react immediately to variations in the 

macroeconomic explanatory variables but tend to do it only after a certain period of 

time. For example, if the buyer decides to buy a car at time t, he can only take into 

consideration the values of the indicators of t-1.This would be an important issue to 

address in further researches. 

An additional interesting research would be to investigate which macroeconomic 

variables may impact on new vehicle sale price and it would also be stimulating to study 

more deeply the relationship between new automobile and used vehicles sales, in 

volume and in prices, during the last years within an environment of economic crisis.
