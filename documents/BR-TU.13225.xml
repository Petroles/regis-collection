O objetivo principal da presente tese consistiu em agregar informações ao 
conhecimento sobre o tubarão galha-branca oceânico (Carcharhinus longimanus), 
principalmente no que se refere à sua distribuição, índices de abundância e 
preferências de habitat. Apesar de ser uma espécie muito capturada na pesca 
oceânica de atuns afins, informações acerca destes aspectos ecológicos são 
escassas e até mesmo ausentes na literatura relacionada à espécie. A tese é 
apresentada como um conjunto de capítulos autônomos, representando artigos 
científicos individuais. No primeiro capítulo-artigo foram discutidos os possíveis 
efeitos de medidas de manejo restritivas, implementadas recentemente por 
Organizações Regionais da Pesca Atuneira e que incluem algumas espécies de 
tubarões oceânicos. Medidas restritivas isoladas terão pouco impacto na redução 
da mortalidade de tubarões oceânicos. Um conjunto de medidas mitigadoras 
integradas será mais eficaz na conservação e recuperação das populações dessas 
espécies. No segundo capítulo-artigo foram analisados dados de captura e 
esforço de 14.835 lançamentos de espinhel pelágico realizados por embarcações 
arrendadas da frota atuneira brasileira, nos anos de 2004 a 2010. A CPUE nominal 
exibiu uma tendência de aumento gradual ao longo dos anos, variando de 0,04 
em 2004 para 0,15 em 2010. A CPUE foi padronizada através de uma abordagem 
delta-GLM, entretanto, o índice de abundância padronizado não diferiu 
significativamente da CPUE nominal. Os modelos indicaram que as capturas de 
tubarões galha-branca são maiores para a estratégia de pesca espanhola, que se 
caracteriza pela utilização de anzóis em profundidades mais rasas. No terceiro 
capítulo-artigo, a interação entre tubarões galha-branca e a pesca de rede de 
cerco nos Oceanos Atlântico e Índico foi analisada, com o objetivo de investigar o 
potencial da utilização do banco de dados dessa pescaria para derivar índices de 
abundância e determinar tendências populacionais para a espécie. Dados de 
observadores de bordo da frota francesa combinados com dados históricos da 
União Soviética foram utilizados na análise. A série temporal combinada incluiu os 
anos entre 1986 e 2014. No Oceano Atlântico não foi possível determinar uma 
tendência populacional, uma vez que o índice de ocorrência foi muito baixo e não 
variou significativamente com o tempo. No Oceano Índico foi observada uma 
mudança bem-marcada no índice de ocorrência, oscilando em torno de 20% 



entre meados dos anos 80 e 90 e caindo para menos de 10% a partir de 2005. No 
quarto capítulo-artigo, a vulnerabilidade do tubarão galha-branca à pesca de 
espinhel pelágico foi avaliada utilizando dados dependentes e independentes da 
pesca. Os dados dependentes incluíram informações de diários de bordo (1999-
2011) e observadores embarcados (2004 a 2010), num total de 65.277 
lançamentos de espinhel. Os dados independentes foram obtidos a partir de 8 
tubarões marcados com marcas do tipo “pop-up satellite archival tag” na área 
onde a frota de espinhel operou. Locais de marcação e desprendimento das 
marcas foram relativamente próximos uns dos outros. Entretanto, os indivíduos 
marcados tenderam a viajar longas distâncias antes de retornar para a área de 
marcação. Foi observado um certo grau de filopatria à área. “Hotspots” de alta 
utilização dos tubarões marcados correspondeu à área sob forte pressão 
pesqueira. Todos os tubarões exibiram uma forte preferência por águas quentes 
e rasas da camada de mistura, gastando, em média, mais de 70% do tempo acima 
da termoclina e 95% acima de 120 m. Esse resultado justifica a maior 
capturabilidade da espécie em espinheis mais rasos. No quinto e último capítulo-
artigo, os movimentos verticais dos tubarões marcados foram analisados em 
detalhe. Apesar da distribuição vertical restrita, os dados indicaram que o tubarão 
galha-branca apresenta padrões de movimento complexos, incluindo padrões de 
migrações circadianas distintos e mergulhos profundos. O padrão circadiano mais 
frequentemente observado é caracterizado de um deslocamento à superfície 
durante o nascer do sol e uma tendência a permanecer em profundidades mais 
baixas durante o dia. Os movimentos verticais também foram influenciados pela 
temperatura da superfície do mar, o que pode indicar a ocorrência de 
termoregulação para espécie. A integração dos resultados de cada capítulo-
artigo proporcionou boas perspectivas para o desenvolvimento de medidas de 
mitigação. A evidência em relação à preferência do tubarão galha-branca por 
águas quentes e rasas é sólida, indicando que a remoção dos anzóis rasos do 
espinhel pode ser proposta para reduzir a captura incidental da espécie. O fato 
de variações na CPUE já terem sido observadas, sugere que esta pode ser uma 
medida eficaz. O comportamento filopátrico observado para o OCS também 
indica que a espécie pode se beneficiar com a criação de áreas marinhas 
protegidas.

The ultimate goal of this thesis was to generate knowledge regarding the ecology 
of the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and contribute for an 
ecosystem-based fishery management. The work focuses on the interactions 
between tuna fisheries and the species and its habitat preferences. Despite being 
frequently caught on high-sea fisheries, there are wide knowledge gaps regarding 
the ecology of the oceanic whitetip shark. The thesis is presented as a set of self-
contained standalone chapters, constructed as individual research articles. The 
first article-chapter provides a discussion concerning pelagic sharks and the 
recent species-specific banning measures implemented by Regional Fishery 
Management Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries. It is unlikely that 
banning measures alone can reduce the high level of fishing mortality and recover 
pelagic shark’s depleted populations. Managers should be fully aware that the 
development and implementation of mitigation measures are critical for a more 
effective conservation strategy. In the second article-chapter, catch and effort data 
from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered 
by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, were analyzed. The nominal catch per unit of effort 
(CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, varying from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks in 
2004 to 0.15 in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-GLM 
approach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ significantly 
from the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of oceanic whitetip 
sharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is characterized by the 
deployment of hooks at shallower depths. In the third article-chapter, the 
interaction between oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery in the 
eastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans was analyzed, in order to investigate 
the potential of using this fishery’s database to derive abundance indexes and 
determine population trends for the species. Observer data from the French purse 
seine fleet combined with a historic database from the Soviet Union were used in 
the analyses. The combined time series spanned from 1986 to 2014. The 
occurrence index was very low for Atlantic Ocean and no marked temporal trend 
was observed. For the Indian Ocean a well-marked change on the occurrence 
index was observed, fluctuating around 20% from mid 80’s to mid 90’s and 
dropping to less than 10% as from 2005. In the fourth article-chapter, a 



combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was used to assess the 
vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline fisheries. Fisheries 
dependent data included information from logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-
board observers (2004 to 2010), totaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries 
independent data were obtained from 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-
up satellite archival tags in the area where longline fleet operated. Tagging and 
pop-up sites were relatively close to each other, although individuals tended to 
travel long distances before returning to the tagging area. Some degree of 
philopatry was observed. High utilization hotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the 
area under strongest fishing pressure. All sharks exhibited a strong preference for 
the warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more than 
70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. This result explains 
the higher catchability of the species on shallow longline gear. In the fifth and last 
article-chapter, the vertical movements of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks were 
analyzed in detail. Despite its restricted vertical distribution, the analyses reveled 
that oceanic whitetips perform complex movement patterns, including distinct 
diel patterns and deep diving behavior. A correlation between vertical 
movements and sea surface temperature was also observed, suggesting the 
occurrence of thermoregulation for the species. The combined results of each 
article-chapter have provided good insights towards the development of 
mitigation measures. The evidence regarding oceanic whitetip shark’s preference 
for warm and shallow waters is solid and this information suggests that the 
removal of the shallow hooks from the longline gear could be proposed as a 
technique to reduce OCS bycatch. The fact that CPUE variations were already 
observed suggests that this might be an effective measure. The philopatric 
behavior observed for the OCS also indicates that the species could benefit from 
time-area closure measures.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 

Flora (CITES) has, on its latest meeting on March 2013, moved the oceanic 

whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus, FAO 3 alpha code = OCS) from 

appendix III to II (CoP16 Prop. 42). CITES is an international agreement between 

governments aiming to ensure that international trade of wild fauna and flora 

does not threaten their survival. Species listed on appendix II are considered 

threatened and their international trade must be closely controlled in order to 

avoid utilization incompatible with their survival. The inclusion of the OCS on 

appendix II was proposed by Brazil, Colombia and the United States. The 

approval of this proposal is a result of the widespread increase of public 

awareness regarding the conservation status of this shark species. 

 

Concerns regarding the conservation of the oceanic whitetip shark started to rise 

substantially from 2006 when the species was classified as vulnerable by the IUCN 

red list of threatened species worldwide and critically endangered in the 

northwest and western central Atlantic Ocean. This status was mainly defined due 

to increasing fishing pressure throughout the species range and due to lack of 

knowledge and adequate monitoring (Baum et al., 2006). In 2010, the 

International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) decided 

to ban landings, storing, and selling of the OCS in the Atlantic Ocean (Rec. 10-07). 

Following this resolution, similar measures were adopted in the Eastern and 

Western Pacific and Indian oceans, by their respective Regional Fishery 

Management Organizations (RFMO): the Inter American Tropical Tuna 

Commission on January 1st 2012 (IATTC Rec. C-11-10), the Western and Central 

Pacific Fisheries Commission on January 1st 2013 (WCPFC CMM 11-04) and the 

Indian Ocean Tuna Commission on January 1st 2014 (IOTC Res. 13–06).

Chapter 1: General introduction 

All of these conservation measures, including the recent listing on CITES appendix 

II, were taken under the precautionary approach concept and represent a first 

step towards the preservation of oceanic whitetip sharks worldwide. Knowledge 

gaps concerning the species ecology and biology are still wide, imposing a 

barrier on the development of mitigation measures for fisheries and accurate 

stock assessments. To bridge these gaps, scientific research is now greatly 

encouraged.

In 2008, around 550,000 tons of tuna and tuna-like species were caught in the 

Atlantic Ocean by both artisanal and industrial fisheries (ICCAT, 2010). These 

species included yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and 

skipjack tunas (Katsuwonus pelamis), swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and other teleost 

fishes and several species of pelagic sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus sp.). 

During the same year, the Brazilian fleet caught 35,000 t of large pelagic fishes, or 

the equivalent of 6% from the whole Atlantic Ocean catches. Skipjack tuna 

represents almost two thirds of the Brazilian catches and has the lower 

commercial value when compared to other tuna species and the swordfish. From 

an economic point of view, those numbers reflect in sub-optimal revenue (Hazin, 

2010). Brazil is strategically located in relation to the main migration routes of 

tuna and tuna-like stocks in the South Atlantic (Hazin and Travassos, 2006). Taking 

into account the great extension of Brazil’s coastline, with approximately 

8,500 km, and its proximity with major fishing grounds, it is clear that the position 

currently occupied by the country in the scenario of open ocean fisheries is not 

justified (CGEE, 2008). While fishing vessels operating from Brazilian ports reach 

areas of occurrence of tuna schools within hours of navigation, long distance 

fishing fleets from countries with consolidated fishing tradition, such as Japan, 

Taiwan, Korea, Spain and Portugal, are required, in some cases, to navigate more 

than 20,000 km to reach the same fishing grounds. The Brazilian government has 

been strongly investing to develop its fishery sector and due to the depletion of

Chapter 1: General introduction 

most coastal stocks (Dias-Neto, 2003) and to the high commercial value of tuna 

species, open ocean fisheries have become a priority (Hazin and Travassos, 2006). 

Investments on the Brazilian fishery sectors include many fronts with great focus 

being put into research, including biology and ecology of target and bycatch 

species as well as oceanography, development of new technology and 

qualification of manpower. 

 

As highly migratory species, tuna stocks are managed by RFMOs. In the case of 

the Atlantic Ocean ICCAT is the entity responsible, from which Brazil is a member 

since its foundation at Rio de Janeiro in 1966. Since then, being able to comply 

with ICCAT recommendations and resolutions is one of the basic principles for 

Brazil. Conservation issues have always been included in Brazil’s agenda, specially 

regarding the vulnerable group of pelagic sharks species. Brazil was one of the 

first countries to adopt a legislation to ban the shark finning practice already in 

1998 (IBAMA decree, Nº 121, August 24 of 1998). A national plan of action for the 

conservation and management of sharks (NPOA Shark) was proposed in 2011 and 

is currently being implemented (Dias-Neto, 2011). The oceanic whitetip shark is 

relatively common in the catches of the Brazilian tuna longline fleet (Frédou et al., 

2015) and due to the strong signs of depletion regarding its population status 

Brazil has actively acted on the behalf of its conservation. The ICCAT banning 

recommendation (Rec. 10-07) was supported by biological studies conducted by 

Brazil and (Tambourgi et al., 2013), as mentioned in the previous item, Brazil was 

also one of the head countries proposing the listing of the OCS on CITES 

appendix II. Following the approval of CITES proposal, Brazil also adopted a 

national banning law for the species (Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture–MPA 

and Ministry of the Environment-MMA normative instruction, Nº1, March 12 of 

2013).

The Chondrichthyans, or cartilaginous fish, form a relative small group with 

approximately 1,115 described species, including sharks, rays and chimaeras 

(Compagno et al., 2005). Pelagic species represent 6% of this group and of those 

roughly 30 inhabit oceanic regions (Camhi, 2009). The also called elasmobranchs 

are known for their k-strategist life cycle, which is characterized by slow growth, 

high longevity, late sexual maturity and low fecundity (Hoenig and Gruber, 1990). 

Due to these characteristics, elasmobranch species exhibit low population growth 

rates (Cortés, 2000), which makes them much more vulnerable to overfishing 

when compared to teleost fish (Frisk et al., 2005; Musick et al., 2000). 

 

In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the deteriorating status 

of the world’s pelagic shark populations (Cortés et al., 2010; Dulvy et al., 2008; 

Worm et al., 2013). Whereas there is some uncertainty about the precise status of 

these species, there is no doubt that shark populations have declined significantly 

(Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Baum and Myers, 2004; Baum et al., 2003; 

Simpfendorfer et al., 2008). It is, therefore, important that management measures 

are in place to ensure the future sustainability and prevent further population 

collapse. Open ocean sharks and rays are relatively numerous and play an 

important role in the food webs of the high seas, but, as wide-ranging animals that 

spend most of their lives far from land these species have received less research 

attention than their coastal relatives (Pikitch et al., 2008).  

 

Most of the world’s shark catches are incidental, constituting bycatch that is either 

discarded at sea or landed for sale. Within the fishing methods with the upmost 

incidence of elasmobranchs are high-seas pelagic longlines, gillnets and purse 

seines targeting mainly tuna and/or swordfish (Bonfil, 1994; Camhi et al., 2008). 

The historically low economic value of shark products compared to the target 

species has resulted in fewer incentives for research and conservation (Barker and 

 5 



Chapter 1: General introduction 

Schluessel, 2005). Global concern on this matter, however, has been growing over 

the past decade (Pikitch and Camhi, 2003). Although statistics concerning shark’s 

catches are very scarce, it is noteworthy that representatives of the Carcharhinidae 

family are amongst the most commonly captured species. These pelagic shark 

species include the oceanic whitetip (C. longimanus), silky (C. falciformis), and 

blue sharks (P. glauca), which are also considered the most abundant ones within 

their group (Compagno, 1984). 

 

The oceanic whitetip shark is easily distinguishable from the other species of the 

Carcharhinidae family by the round shape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as 

well as by the white stains in their margins (Compagno, 1984). Their large fins are 

highly valued in international trade making them an important target of this 

market (Camhi, 2009; Clarke et al., 2006). Once considered amongst the most 

abundant oceanic sharks, the oceanic whitetip is now commonly perceived as 

rare. Inadequate monitoring makes the estimates of their populations very difficult 

but there is a scientific general consensus that populations are decreasing (Baum 

et al., 2006). 

 

Despite its worldwide distribution and frequent catches on most high seas pelagic 

fisheries, little has been published on the biology and ecology of the oceanic 

whitetip shark. The first few studies were conducted more than 50 years ago, in 

the western North Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including general 

information on diet, reproduction and behavior (Backus et al., 1956; Strasburg, 

1958). Since then, however, very little was added until the past decade when 

more detailed biological studies were published (Lessa et al., 1999a, 1999b; Seki 

et al., 1998). It was not until very recent that new information regarding oceanic 

whitetip shark’s started to become available again, these included movement 

patterns, temperature preferences and biology studies (Howey-Jordan et al., 

2013; Madigan et al., 2015; Musyl et al., 2011; Tambourgi et al., 2013).

Chapter 1: General introduction 

In the past year, a first stock assessment was conducted for the oceanic whitetip 

shark in the Pacific Ocean (Rice and Harley, 2012). It was concluded that either 

overfishing is occurring or the stock is overfished and the greatest impact on the 

stock was attributed to bycatch from the longline fishery, with lesser impacts from 

purse seining. Considering the bycatch nature of fishery impacts, it was advised 

that mitigation measures could provide the best opportunity to improve the status 

of the oceanic whitetip population, as it has being suggested for shark species in 

general (Gilman et al., 2008). The development of new research regarding stock 

structure, behavior, post-release survival, female maturity, improvement of basic 

catch and effort data, among others, was also advised. The deficiency of such 

information prevented similar analyses for being conducted for the Atlantic 

(Cortés et al., 2010) and Indian Ocean stocks.

This work is product of an international research cooperation between France, 

through the Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD) and Brazil, through 

the Departamento de Pesca e Aquicultura of the Universidade Federal Rural de 

Pernambuco (UFRPE). The aim of this international cooperation is to mitigate the 

adverse ecological impacts caused by open ocean fisheries in the Atlantic and 

Indian oceans, with focus on the bycatch issue of tuna fisheries. 

 

The thesis is presented as a set of self-contained standalone chapters, constructed 

as individual research articles. Consequently, styles might vary and references, as 

well as other components, may occasionally be repeated to accommodate the 

styles of different journals. Following this first introductory chapter, five article-

chapters are presented. These chapters address ecological and conservation 

issues regarding the oceanic whitetip shark. The ultimate goal was to generate 

knowledge and contribute for an ecosystem-based fishery management (Gilman 

et al., 2014; Pikitch et al., 2004). A closing chapter, integrating the main findings 

 7 



Chapter 1: General introduction 

of each article-chapter is also presented. An overview of each article-chapter is 

given below. 

 

Chapter 2 provides a discussion concerning pelagic sharks and the recent 

species-specific banning measures implemented by Regional Fishery 

Management Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries. These measures 

include retention bans, finning bans and trading bans. The positive and negative 

aspects of such measures are analyzed inside of two distinct scenarios: one where 

pelagic sharks are the targeted species and other where they represent the 

bycatch component. The main objective was to alert managers that banning 

measures are not the final step towards the conservation of pelagic sharks, but 

rather the initial one. 

 

In Chapter 3, catch and effort data from the Brazilian tuna longline fleet were 

analyzed. This chapter provides information on size, distribution and catch rates of 

the oceanic whitetip sharks caught by this fishery. Data was analyzed with regards 

to year, season and fishing strategy. Little is known in relation to the spatial 

distribution and relative abundance of the species. Understanding how oceanic 

whitetip sharks interact with the fishery will help on the development of mitigation 

measures to prevent their capture. 

 

Following the idea behind Chapter 3, Chapter 4 provides an analysis of the 

interaction between oceanic whitetip sharks and the tuna purse seine fishery. 

Catch and effort data form the French fleet operating in the eastern Atlantic and 

western Indian oceans were available for this analysis. Additional historic data 

from the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean was also included. The main objective 

was to investigate the potential of using this fishery’s database to derive 

abundance indexes and determine population trends for the species. 

 

In Chapter 5, a combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was 

used to assess the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline 

 8 



Chapter 1: General introduction 

fisheries. Fisheries independent data consisted on information collected with the 

use pop-up satellite archival tags. These tags provide information on depth, water 

temperature and ambient light level (for estimation of geolocation) experienced 

by the tagged individuals. Sharks were tagged in the same area where the 

Brazilian longline operates, thus the fisheries dependent data comes from this 

fishery. Vulnerability was assessed with regards to both spatial dynamics 

(horizontal) and depth distribution (vertical) of both shark and longline gear, 

taking into consideration seasonality and strategies in the fishery. The overall goal 

was to provide information to aid in the design of mitigation measures and 

improve conservation efforts for the species. 

 

Finally, Chapter 6 provides a detailed analysis of the vertical movements of the 

tagged oceanic whitetip sharks. Most of the recently published information 

describing depth and temperature preferences for the species consisted on 

general summaries only (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011). Vertical 

movements were not explored in detail. The aim of this chapter was to describe 

potential diel cycles, highlighting similar and contrasting patterns amongst 

individuals. An analysis of the species vertical occupation with regards to 

environmental variables, especially the temperature structure in the water column, 

is also provided.

Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

A b s t r a c t  
Recently, declining populations of several pelagic shark species have led to global 
conservation concerns surrounding this group. As a result, a series of species-
specific banning measures have been implemented by Regional Fishery 
Management Organizations (RFMOs) in charge of tuna fisheries, which include 
retention bans, finning bans and trading bans. There are both positive and 
negative aspects to most management measures, but generally, the positive 
aspects outweigh the negatives, ensuring the measure is beneficial to the 
resource and its users in the long term. Banning measures are a good first step 
towards the conservation of pelagic shark species, especially since they improve 
conservation awareness among fishers, managers and the public. Measures that 
impose total bans, however, can lead to negative impacts that may jeopardize the 
populations they were intended to protect. The majority of pelagic shark catches 
are incidental and most sharks die before they reach the vessel or after they are 
released. The legislation set out by RFMOs only prevents retention but not the 
actual capture or the mortality that may occur as a result. Managers should be fully 
aware that the development and implementation of mitigation measures are 
critical for a more effective conservation strategy. 
 

1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  
 

As populations of highly migratory species decline due to over-exploitation or 

other human induced causes, management measures are often implemented to 

aid their conservation and restore populations to pre-existing levels (Hoffmann et 

al., 2010). Such measures have a variety of forms, typically linked to the level of 

concern surrounding the population in question. Generally, as concerns become 

increasingly severe, management measures follow suit and often conclude with 

total bans 	on harvesting and global trade of a species. While these measures are 
generally believed to aid in species conservation, they can, at times, lead to 

increased pressure on the population at risk (Rivalan et al., 2007). 

 

Recently, declining populations of several pelagic shark species have led to global 

conservation concerns surrounding this group (Fowler et al., 2005; Dulvy et al., 

2008; Aires-da-Silva and Gallucci, 2008; Cortés et al., 2010). These sharks are 

 14 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

both targeted and taken incidentally as bycatch by a range of fleets from coastal 

artisanal to industrial vessels operating in distant waters (Bonfil, 1994; Wormet al., 

2013). An inherent issue with exploitation of elasmobranch species, as compared 

to their teleost counterparts, is their low rebound capacity resulting directly from 

their characteristic life history traits of slow growth, late maturation and low 

fecundity (Cortés, 2000). As such, this group is generally far more vulnerable to 

overfishing than teleost fish species (Musick et al., 2002; Compagno et al., 2005). 

 

With the increasing conservation concern over this sensitive group, a series of 

species-specific banning measures have recently been established by Regional 

Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) responsible for the management of 

tuna fisheries. These measures include retention bans, finning bans and trading 

bans. There are both positive and negative aspects to most management 

measures, but generally, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives ensuring the 

measure is beneficial to the resource and its users in the long term. Management 

measures based on retention, finning or trading bans are no different. Here we 

highlight both the benefits and drawbacks of such measures, in order to assess 

their overall efficacy and long-term benefit to populations. 

 

2 .  B a n n i n g  m e a s u r e s  
 

Fisheries that target widely distributed and highly migratory species are managed 

by international commissions, of which cooperating countries/parties are 

members. There are five such commissions (RFMOs) that regulate the world’s tuna 

fisheries, each with jurisdiction over an ocean/ocean region or target species: the 

International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic tuna (ICCAT), the Indian 

Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 

Commission (WCPFC), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), 

overseeing fishery activity in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the Commission for 

the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), overseeing all fisheries 

 15 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

targeting southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus macoyii). Aside from tuna species, these 

RFMOs are also usually responsible for the management of any other species 

caught in association with tuna fisheries. Management measures generally stem 

from the results of annual stock assessments and the advice from scientific 

committees linked to RFMOs. These measures are set out in the form of 

recommendations or resolutions, which contracting parties are then required to 

implement and report upon. 

 

To date, several species-specific management measures have been developed 

under the tuna RFMOs that pertain to the incidental capture of pelagic sharks. 

These measures are hereafter referred to as banning measures. Generally, they 

stipulate that all contracting parties shall prohibit retention, transshipment, 

landing or storing any part, or whole carcass, of the species in question. 

Additionally, some of these measures require captured sharks to be promptly 

released unharmed and/or further state that trading, selling or offering for sale is 

also prohibited (Table 1). As a result, oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), 

silky (C. falciformis), thresher (Alopias spp.) and hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.) 

sharks fall under such resolutions in at least one ocean (Table 1). These measures 

were all developed fairly recently by tuna RFMOs (2010–2013). The oceanic 

whitetip shark is the only species covered by such measures across all oceans. 

 

In addition to RFMO management measures, international treaties also regulate 

the trade of certain marine species. The Convention on International Trade in 

Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is one such treaty and plays 

an important role in managing wildlife. CITES represents an international 

agreement among governments that aims to ensure that international trade of 

wild fauna and flora does not threaten their survival. In accordance with this 

convention, the international trade of specified species can either be closely 

controlled (species listed on appendix II) or completely banned (appendix I), 

depending on its population status or vulnerability. During the most recent 

meeting of CITES (March 2013), the oceanic whitetip and hammerhead sharks 

 16 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

were included in appendix II (CoP16 Prop. 42 and 43), requiring their 

international trade to be closely controlled.

Banning the retention and trade of pelagic sharks can drastically decrease their 

fishing mortality in fisheries where they are directly targeted. Essentially, the aim 

of these measures is to give the stocks the opportunity to recover to pre- 

exploitation levels. It is well known, however, that the great majority of pelagic 

shark mortality results from their incidental capture in high-seas pelagic longlines, 

gillnets and purse seine fisheries that primarily target tuna and tuna-like species 

 17 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

(Gilman et al., 2008; Bonfil, 1994). Nevertheless, sharks are undeniably 

considered a valuable bycatch in many fleets and are increasingly becoming a 

target as well (Hareide et al., 2007). The implementation of banning measures in 

these fisheries not only encourages fishers to modify their current practices, but 

also prevents these species from shifting from an incidental catch to a specific 

target. 

 

An increasing number of marine populations are showing signs of recovery after 

an advance on conservation efforts, especially through measures that ban trade or 

any exploitation activity (Lotze et al., 2011). Marine mammals represent the group 

with the greatest results in terms of conservation success for this ecosystem. A 

recent study has shown that 42% of 92 spatially non-overlapping marine mammal 

populations are significantly increasing as a result of measures that ban their	
exploitation and trade (Magera et al., 2013). Whales are, perhaps, the best 

example of this success. The banning regulations set by the International Whaling 

Commission (IWC) have reduced whale hunting dramatically and brought most 

exploited species out of extinction risk (Magera et al., 2013). Some humpback 

whale populations from the Southern Hemisphere are even expected to reach 

their estimated pre-whaling abundance levels over the next decade (Gales et al., 

2011). 

 

Such banning measures, however, can also bring unintended negative effects. By 

prohibiting their trade, the products from these species may develop into rare and 

luxurious commodities. This perceived rarity could lead to increased consumer 

demand, making their illegal trade highly profitable. In extreme cases, when 

demand is sufficiently high, the protected species could eventually be driven to 

extinction (Courchamp et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2008). There is strong evidence that 

demonstrates how moving a species to a more restrictive CITES appendix can 

lead to a drastic increase in its illegal trade (Rivalan et al., 2007). During the 

transition period, between initial announcement of such a measure and its final 

implementation into the legislation, trade volumes have been observed to 

 18 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

increase up to 135% (Rivalan et al., 2007). Furthermore, the black market price of 

rhinoceros horn increased by more than 400% within 2 years of their listing under 

Appendix I (Rivalan et al., 2007). 

 

Shark fins are highly valued and their trade is currently very profitable. The global 

value of this market ranges between approximately US$ 400 and 550 million per 

year (Clarke et al., 2007). Being a luxury commodity in Asian cuisine, these species 

could become highly vulnerable should their availability decrease. Fin traders 

generally distinguish the fins of different shark species (Clarke et al., 2006) and 

the rarity of a particular species could be capitalized upon, although consumers 

do not currently make that distinction. Owing to their large rounded shape and 

characteristic white marking (Compagno, 1984), the fins of the oceanic whitetip 

shark are among the easiest to identify (Clarke et al., 2006), meaning its 

vulnerability could increase to dangerous levels should their rarity become an 

attractive quality. Additionally, in light of the multitude of conservation regulations 

set forth for this species of late, awareness regarding its threatened status has 

clearly increased. Once considered amongst the most abundant oceanic sharks, 

the oceanic whitetip is now commonly perceived as rare and there is a wide 

consensus that populations are decreasing (Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Clarke et 

al., 2012; Rice and Harley, 2012). Although future scenarios are difficult to predict, 

it seems that many of the rarity-associated black market factors described above 

are possible for this shark species, especially in light of the global ban on its 

retention in pelagic fisheries under tuna RFMO management.

As stated above, pelagic shark mortality is primarily due to their incidental capture 

in high seas fisheries as a result of the shared habitat of pelagic sharks and tunas. 

Since retention and trade are banned but not the actual capture, banning 

 19 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

measures in their current form will have little impact on Fisher-behavior. As such, 

capture rates are unlikely to change. While mortality rates are both gear and 

species specific (Skomal, 2007; Campana et al., 2009; Clarke et al., 2013), they are 

often high as a large portion of incidentally caught sharks are already dead/dying 

by the time they reach the vessel or after release (Rogan and Mackey, 2007; 

Poisson et al., 2014a; Hutchinson et al., 2015). 

 

In the case of the tropical tuna purse seine fishery, the conditions in the sack of the 

net creates a highly stressful environment, with low oxygen levels and increased 

temperatures, which directly affect the mortality of the catch (Hall and Roman, 

2013). Subsequently, the brailing process further reduces the chances of survival 

as sharks are compressed between the 2 and 8 tons of tuna in the brail (scoop net 

used to load the catch onboard the seiner). Brailed silky sharks were found to 

have an overall mortality rate of 85%, including the ones that appeared to be in 

relatively good condition upon release (Poisson et al., 2014a; Hutchinson et al., 

2015). Scalloped hammerhead sharks exhibited one of the lowest survival rates 

compared to other pelagic sharks when caught on pelagic longlines (Gallagher et 

al., 2014). The authors considered that the incidental capture of this species in 

tuna longline fisheries played an important role in the substantial population 

decline reported for the Northwest Atlantic (Baum et al., 2003). 

 

While it is true that species with high rates of live caught individuals as well as 

post release survival could benefit from banning measures, in cases similar to the 

silky and scalloped hammerhead sharks the outcome of these measures alone 

would be rendered biologically ineffective for the recovery of the stocks. 

Furthermore, should illegal trade prices be sufficiently high, fishers may be willing 

to take the risk of prosecution and retain the sharks (or their fins) for 

commercialization. 

 

The complication associated with the mixed capture of target and bycatch species 

preclude banning measures from being the final solution for curbing mortality and 

 20 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

aiding the recovery of pelagic shark stocks. However, this does not mean that 

these measures provide no benefits. Whenever a banning measure is established, 

it directly implies that the population concerned is under severe threat. As such, 

the establishment of a ban indirectly results in improved public awareness 

regarding the species’ conservation risk and that extreme action is required for its 

protection. Essentially, such bans can act as an awareness campaign to alert 

fishers and consumers who play a crucial role in conservation. In 1990, following 

strong media pressure regarding the mortality of dolphins in the eastern Pacific 

Ocean by tuna purse seine fisheries, the US Congress approved the Dolphin 

Protection Consumer Information Act establishing the use of a ‘‘dolphin safe’’ 

label on tuna cans which contained tuna not caught in association with dolphins 

(Joseph, 1994). A market analysis showed that media pressure and subsequent 

implementation of dolphin-safe labeling affected consumer behavior (Teisl et al., 

2002), providing an insight in how public awareness can be a useful tool for 

wildlife conservation. This public pressure led to the development of a mitigation 

technique, the backdown process, where the seiner is put into reverse elongating 

the net and causing the cork line to sink at one extremity. This maneuver allows 

dolphins to safely swim away over the sunken corks. Thanks to the backdown 

process, fishers can still target tuna schools associated with dolphins. The 

technique is mandatory for tuna purse seiners fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean 

(IATTC) and its compliance is controlled thanks to the presence of onboard 

observers. 

 

Pelagic shark populations could benefit significantly from an increase in public 

awareness. In the not too distant past, sharks were seen as little more than a threat 

to humans. Although this perception is slowly changing (Simpfendorfer et al., 

2011), the need for continued efforts to raise public awareness regarding 

conservation requirements is essential and the establishment of species specific 

bans will aid in this effort.

5 .  P o t e n t i a l  s o l u t i o n s  
 

The incidental nature of shark catches in tuna fisheries worldwide suggest that 

mitigation measures are an essential tool for an effective conservation strategy. A 

set of integrated measures will more effectively aid in the conservation and 

recovery of threatened pelagic sharks than banning measures alone. These 

measures should mainly include: (1) the development of alternative fishing 

techniques; and (2) the reduction of fishing effort, e.g. developing spatial or 

temporal management measures such as closed areas/seasons. 

 

Developing techniques that prevent the capture of pelagic sharks is critical. Gear 

modifications have been proved effective in reducing capture and mortality of 

some bycatch species, such as dolphins, seabirds and marine turtles (Coe et al., 

1984; Gilman et al., 2006; Løkkeborg, 2011; Andraka et al., 2013). Gear 

modifications to mitigate pelagic sharks capture represent a real challenge as 

their distributions and behavior have strong similarities to that of targeted 

species. However, some techniques that have been proposed could be 

investigated further. Fishing gears with the highest incidence of incidentally 

caught sharks are gillnets, pelagic longlines and purse seiners. Gillnets together 

with longlines are responsible for the greatest impacts, but very little research has 

been done to develop mitigation methods to reduce shark bycatch in this fishing 

gear (Oliver et al., 2015). More research has been conducted on longline and 

purse seine gear. 

 

In pelagic longline fisheries, epipelagic species, such as the oceanic whitetip 

shark, could benefit from the removal of shallow hooks (Tolotti et al., 2013). This 

simple measure has been shown to reduce the capture of several bycatch species, 

while also increasing the number of hooks available for the target species (Kitchell 

et al., 2004; Beverly et al., 2009; Watson and Bigelow, 2014). Rare earth metals 

are a potential tool to mitigate shark bycatch, as they can work as a repellent due 

 22 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

to the strong electric field they produce the in water (Stroud, 2007). Much 

research is still required, however, as this method seems highly complex and 

results can be conflicting as well as species specific (Stoner and Kaimmer, 2008; 

Robbins et al., 2011; Hutchinson et al., 2012; Godin et al., 2013). To 

 

To reduce the fishery induced mortality of pelagic sharks caught by tropical tuna 

purse seiners, it is imperative to direct research efforts at finding ways to release 

them before the retrieval of the net or to attract them away from the tuna 

aggregation before the net is set. A natural segregation between sharks and tuna 

inside the net has been repeatedly observed, which could allow for the 

establishment of a release system (Itano et al., 2012). Preliminary tests were 

conducted in the Western Pacific ocean and scientists believe this mitigation 

measure has potential (Itano et al., 2012). 

 

Another relevant issue with purse seine fisheries that has recently been brought to 

light is the exceptionally high rate of silky sharks becoming entangled on the nets 

hanging below fish aggregating devices (Filmalter et al., 2013). The construction 

of such devices should be controlled and the use of nets needs to be banned. In 

fact, several RFMOs have recently adopted recommendations in this regard, 

which stipulate that the use of netting in the construction of fish aggregating 

devices should be avoided (ex.: IATTC Res.13-04, IOTC Res.13-08). 

 

The handling of sharks after capture plays an important role in the survival rate of 

released individuals. To increase their chances of survival, best handling practices 

guides need to be developed for each fishery (see Poisson et al., 2014b as an 

example). Naturally, the development of such guides has to be paired with post 

release survival studies. Investigating post-release mortality is also an essential 

part when assessing the efficacy of banning measures and, although costly, 

require significant research attention. Once best practices guides are developed, 

incentives or disincentives should be promoted in order to facilitate the adoption 

 23 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

of good practices by fishers. Market related incentives, such as eco-labels, could 

be an encouraging tool (ex. MSC certification and ISSF PVR). 

 

Time area closures have helped the recovery of stocks of a variety of species, from 

marine invertebrates, such as mollusks, to teleost fishes (Lester et al., 2009; 

Roberts, 2012; Kerwath et al., 2013). Although most of the successful experiences 

come from coastal fisheries, positive results encourage the investigation of 

implementing such measures for pelagic sharks. The great challenge with pelagic 

time area closures resides on the high mobility of pelagic species and on the lack 

of data concerning this complex ecosystem (Game et al., 2009). This means that 

the protected area would have to have exaggerated proportions or target smaller 

areas where fishing activities would provoke higher impacts, such as nurseries 

and/or spawning zones (Kaplan et al., 2010). Considering the high cost of 

enforcement, a targeted time area closure seems more feasible. Watson et al. 

(2008) found some promising results regarding silky shark bycatch in the Eastern 

Pacific Ocean tuna fishery. The authors found that juveniles silky sharks are mostly 

concentrated north of the equator and estimated that area closures could have 

reduced up to 33% of the species bycatch while compromising only 12% of the 

tuna catch. A similar hotspot of juvenile silky sharks has also been identified in the 

Indian Ocean and authors noted that this area does not overlap with the highest 

catch per unit of effort area of the purse seine fisheries (Amandè et al., 2011). 

 

Finally, monitoring is key for any successful management system. There is a 

history of poor reporting of shark catches, largely due to their incidental nature 

(Bonfil, 1994; Camhi et al., 2008; Clarke, 2013; Oliver et al., 2015). Despite 

improvements in recent years (FAO, 2014), notably due to RFMO requirements to 

report shark bycatch (ex. ICCAT Rec.04- 10), a banning measure may jeopardize 

this trend. Under these regulations captains may be inclined not to report the 

capture of a banned species at all as to avoid repercussions, especially if they 

have the intention of illegal commercialization. The current low coverage level of 

 24 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

independent observers in most high seas fisheries makes this scenario particularly 

concerning (Worm et al., 2013). 

 

Data deficiency is a paramount issue for fisheries management, as stock 

assessment methods rely largely on catch and effort time series data (Barker and 

Schleussel, 2005). To date, only a handful of stock assessments have been 

conducted for pelagic sharks (ICCAT, 2009; Rice and Harley, 2012, 2013). 

Additionally, the results of these assessments are usually interpreted with 

considerable caution due to the data deficiencies and the resulting high level of 

uncertainty of the assessments (Cortés et al., 2010). Until every vessel exploiting 

the high seas has some form of independent observer or observation system 

onboard, the reliability of such data will remain questionable. Standardized 

fisheries independent surveys could be a simple solution to overcoming this issue. 

Electronic observation systems still have limitations, especially regarding bycatch 

identification, but promising results indicate this system could also be a useful tool 

to improve both monitoring and data collection (Ames et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 

2014) 

 

6 .  F i n a l  r e m a r k s  
 

The problem faced in pelagic shark management is a direct result of the way 

fishermen catch their fish in an environment shared by target and bycatch species. 

The current fishing methods are not selective enough to avoid catching sharks. 

Banning measures in their present form do little to discourage the incidental 

capture of sharks and are unlikely to be effective enough, even with an increase in 

release numbers, to rebuild stocks. Banning measures are one form of 

management, but cannot be the only one applied. They are a positive initial step 

towards the conservation of endangered shark species. They act on a 

precautionary approach basis and also improve conservation awareness among 

fishers, managers and the general public. 

 25 



Chapter 2: Banning is not enough 

Banning measures can provide positive outcomes to the conservation of pelagic 

sharks, but their effectiveness is directly linked to whether the species at issue is 

the target of the fisheries or a bycatch component (Fig. 1). For fisheries where 

sharks are bycatch, the banning measure would imperatively need to be 

accompanied by (i) high observer coverage and (ii) mitigation measures. Viewing 

banning measures as a final solution could result in lowered research incentives 

and hamper the further development of appropriate mitigation measures. 

Furthermore, without high observer coverage, such a measure could lead to less 

catch data, therefore less monitoring of the impacts of fisheries on these species, 

and less opportunities to improve our knowledge on the biology of these species 

at risk. We consider that the implementation of high observer coverage is urgent, 

especially on longline fisheries, as well as the adoption of measures that can 

reduce the fishing mortality of sharks by avoiding their catch and increasing their 

survival after release.

Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

A b s t r a c t  
Catch and effort data from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna 
longline vessels chartered by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, were analyzed aiming at 
assessing the size, distribution and the relative abundance of the oceanic whitetip 
shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic 
Ocean. The nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, 
from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year of the time series, up to 0.13, 
in 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased sharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, 
then, back to 0.15, in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-
GLM approach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ 
significantly from the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of 
oceanic whitetip sharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is 
characterized by the deployment of hooks at shallower depths. These results 
indicate that the use of deep longline hooks (&gt;100 m) may help to mitigate the 
bycatch of this species. 
 

1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  
 

The oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a circumtropical species 

known as one of the main pelagic sharks worldwide (Bonfil et al., 2008; 

Compagno, 1984), being caught as a bycatch by a variety of pelagic fishing gears, 

such as tuna and swordfish pelagic longlines, pelagic gillnets, and, to a lesser 

extent, tuna purse seines (Amande et al., 2011; Bonfil, 1994). It is easily 

distinguishable from the other species of the Carcharhinidae family by the round 

shape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as well as by the white stains in their 

margins (Compagno, 1984). Their large fins are highly valued in international 

trade and make them a target of this market. 

 

Inadequate monitoring makes the estimates of their populations very difficult but 

there is a general consensus that populations are decreasing (Baum et al., 2006). 

This species is listed vulnerable by IUCN worldwide and even critically 

endangered in the northwest and western central Atlantic Ocean. Consequently, 

conservation and management actions are urgently required for this species. The 

 34 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) has 

recently decided to ban the landing, storing, and selling of this species in the 

Atlantic Ocean (Rec. 10-07). Similar measures were adopted in the Pacific Ocean 

by the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC Rec. C-11-10) and the 

Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC CMM 11-04). 

 

Despite its worldwide distribution and frequent catches in most pelagic fisheries 

(Bonfil, 1994) little has been published on the species biology and ecology. Some 

general studies, including diet, reproduction and behavior of the oceanic whitetip 

shark were conducted in the western North Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific 

Ocean, more than fifty years ago (Backus et al., 1956; Strasburg, 1958). Since 

then, however, very little was added to the knowledge on the species until the 

past decade when new data from the South Atlantic was published by Lessa et al. 

(1999a,b), Domingo et al. (2007) and Coelho et al. (2009). 

 

Most of the information available for the South Atlantic, however, is related to 

biological aspects (morphometry, reproduction, age and growth), with very little 

known in relation to its spatial distribution and relative abundance. The present 

study analyses data from foreign tuna longline fleets chartered by Brazil, with the 

goal to assess distribution, catch rates and size composition of the oceanic 

whitetip shark in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean in order to fill 

gaps on species knowledge and to help define appropriate measures for their 

conservation. 

 

2 .  M a t e r i a l  a n d  m e t h o d s  
 

Catch and effort data from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna 

longline vessels chartered by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010 were analyzed. Longline 

sets were distributed in a wide area of the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic 

Ocean, ranging from 10°N to 35°S and from 007°E to 045°W. Data were obtained 

 35 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

from logbooks filled out by on-board observers of the Brazilian National Observer 

Program. Logbooks contained information on the number of hooks, the number 

of fish caught, by species, and the geographic position at the beginning of each 

set. 

 

The Brazilian National Observer Program aims to collect precise information on 

fishing strategy, catch composition and biological samples from catches taken by 

foreign vessels chartered by Brazil. In this study, logbook information was 

obtained from the chartered fleet operating off northeast Brazil for which there is 

100% observer coverage. These chartered vessels make up for approximately 

30% of the whole foreign and Brazilian longline fleet and almost 60% of the fleet 

based in the northeast. 

 

During the period analyzed, six different flags were active: Spain, Panama, 

Morocco, United Kingdom, Honduras, and Portugal. However, they can be 

divided into two distinct fishing strategies, Spanish and Japanese. The first (Spain, 

Morocco, Honduras and United Kingdom) aims for swordfish and operates during 

the night with surface longlines (down to 100 m) using light attraction and squid 

as bait. The latter (Panama and Portugal) aims for tuna species and operates early 

in the morning with deep longlines (down to more than 200 m) using small 

pelagic fish as bait (mainly mackerel). 

 

Nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) was calculated as the number of 

sharks/1000 hooks by year and by quarters (years combined). For the spatial 

distribution of the CPUE the catch and effort data were grouped into 5°×5° 

squares of latitude and longitude. In this case, the CPUE was calculated by the 

sum of all catch and all effort in each square. Information regarding discards of 

this species were not available, thus CPUE was calculated based only in the 

retained catches.  

 

 36 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

In order to account for the possible influences of seasonality, area and fishing 

strategy on CPUE annual variability, a standardization was performed assuming 

negative binomial and delta-lognormal distributions. The evaluation of residual 

plots indicated that the delta-lognormal outperformed the negative binomial 

model and therefore the delta-lognormal was chosen as the preferred model. In 

the delta-GLM approach the presence–absence (PA) of fish in the data set was 

modeled assuming a binomial distribution, while the proportion of positive 

catches (POS) was modeled assuming a lognormal distribution. Year, fishing flag 

and quarter, expressed as categorical variables, and the interaction between 

latitude and longitude, expressed as continuous variables, were used as 

explanatory variables for both presence–absence and positive catch models. 

Fishing flag was represented by two categories: Japanese (JAP) and Spanish 

(ESP). These were defined based on the two configurations of fishing gear 

employed by the fleet analyzed in this study. The indices per year for these two 

models were multiplied in order to obtain the overall index of abundance. 

Confidence intervals for the overall index of abundance were calculated using the 

delta method (Lo et al., 1992). 

 

From 2005, additional data on sex, total length (TL), fork length (FL) and inter-

dorsal (ID) length were also collected. All lengths were obtained by laying the fish 

on the deck and measuring it in a straight line. Whenever the TL was not available, 

the FL and the ID were converted to TL by linear regressions estimated with the 

available data from the present research (Table 1). A total of 1612 individuals 

were measured, representing 64% of the oceanic whitetip sharks caught (2491) 

and 1218 were sexed. For the spatial analysis, the mean length was calculated for 

each 5°× 5° square. Squares were excluded from the spatial analysis if the number 

of fish measured was less than five. To test the possibility of spatial segregation by 

sex a chi-squared test of independence was performed through a contingence 

table with the counts of males and females divided into three areas (north, central 

and south). A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test was also performed to test the 1:1 

 37

sex ratio hypothesis. Both statistical tests were performed at 0.05 significance 

level.

Fishing effort peaked in 2005, when about 8 million hooks were deployed, almost 

double from the previous year. Since 2005, the number of hooks exhibited a 

declining trend, until 2010 the last year included in the series when about only 1 

million hooks were deployed (Figure 1). The Japanese fishing strategy was the 

most common whereas the Spanish strategy was dominant in 2006 and 2007. 

During the last three years of the time series the Japanese strategy was 

completely absent.

The spatial distribution of the fishing effort also varied throughout the period, with 

2005 showing the greatest spatial coverage, naturally due to the higher number 

of hooks deployed that year. All active flags operated in similar areas, although 

vessels fishing with the Spanish strategy represented a broader range and also 

operated more southward (Figure 2). 

 

The area with the highest concentration of effort was located between the 

latitudes of 5°N and 5°S (Figure 2). Oceanic islands, such as the archipelago of 

Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Fernando de Noronha Island and Rocas Atoll, as well as 

several seamounts, pertaining to the North Brazil Chain and to the Fernando de 

Noronha Chain, present in that area, are considered to be important fishing 

grounds for tuna and tuna-like species off northeast Brazil (Hazin, 1993). 

Important fishing grounds are located at a rather short distance from the ports 

where the longliners were based (Natal-RN, Recife-PE and Cabedelo-PB). Another 

important fishing area is located further south, near the seamounts and islands of 

the Vitoria–Trindade Chain. 

 

The nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for the oceanic whitetip shark 

exhibited a gradual increase, from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year 

of the time series, up to 0.13, in 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased 

sharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, then, back to 0.15, in 2010. The standardized 

index of abundance did not differ markedly from the nominal CPUE index (Figure 

3). This fact could indicate that the nominal CPUE is a good proxy for the overall 

index of abundance for this species or that the standardization was not efficient in 

accounting for the factors that affected CPUE but were not related to abundance. 

It is possible that the CPUE standardization was compromised due to the low 

number of years in the data series and the lack of a homogeneous distribution of 

fishing effort and fishing strategy across the areas, years and quarters.

For the presence–absence portion of the delta-GLM, years, quarters and strategy 

were the most significant factors, whereas for the positive catches portion of the 

model the order of relative importance of those variables changed to strategy, 

years and quarters. The parameter estimates associated with the presence–

absence and positive catch models show which variables were significant for each 

model and in which direction the factors affect the index. For the presence–

absence model, all years had positive estimates in relation to 2004, meaning that 

those years had a positive effect in the presence of oceanic whitetip shark. 

However, all years had negative estimates for the positive catch model, meaning 

that years had a negative effect on CPUE values. In summary, it appears that the 

fish was more frequently encountered but at lower numbers with time. The fishing 

strategy was the only factor found to be significant for both presence–absence 

and positive catch models, with the Japanese fishing strategy showing a negative 

effect for both, indicating that the catches of oceanic whitetip are higher for the

Spanish fishing strategy which is characterized by the deployment of hooks at 

shallower depth (Tables 2 and 3). This relationship is in agreement with the 

described preference of this shark for near-surface waters (Musyl et al., 2011) and 

with the results obtained by Bromhead et al. (2012) showing that the oceanic 

whitetip is caught in higher numbers when hooks are set at a shallower depths.

caught by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered by Brazil operating in the equatorial and

The spatial distribution of the CPUE by year (Figure 4) shows that, in 2004, the 

number of zero catches was very high, with positive catches being only recorded 

between the latitudes of 10°N and 5°S, and CPUE values ranging from 0.01 to 

0.07 sharks/1000 hooks. From 2005, positive catches were recorded more 

southward (up to 30°S) and eastward (up to 10°W), than in 2004. High CPUE 

values (&gt;0.50), from 2005 to 2007, were recorded in the square from 10°S to 20°S 

and from 30°W to 40°W, with the only exception of a high value also recorded in 

2006, close to the African coast (0–5°N; 10–15°W). In 2008, the year with the 

highest mean CPUE (0.43), the area with the highest catch rates expanded

2008, catches of oceanic whitetip shark were recorded in almost all 5° squares 

where there was effort. In 2009, the 5° square mean CPUE values became 

generally low again, with only one being above 0.50 located off north Brazil and

Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

 
F i g u r e  4 .  Annual distribution of CPUE (per 1000 hooks) of oceanic whitetip sharks 
caught by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered by Brazil from 2004 to 2010. Crosses 
represent squares with effort and zero catch 
 

Domingo et al. (2007), analyzing data from the Uruguayan longline fleet, found 

the highest CPUE (0.49 sharks/1000 hooks) for the species in an area close to the 

one that showed the highest CPUE in the present study (around 20°S/35°W). 

Except from an apparent trend for the oceanic whitetip shark to move away from 

the Brazilian southeast coast in the fourth quarter of the year, the CPUE 

distribution by quarters (Figure 5) showed no clear pattern of seasonal change. 

 

The proportion of the oceanic whitetip shark in relation to the total catch and in 

relation to the catches of elasmobranches were very low (Figure 6), 0.3% and 

2.7%, respectively. The oceanic whitetip shark yearly proportion of the total catch 

did not exceed 0.4%, except for 2008, when it reached 1.4%. Its proportion in 

 43 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

relation to the elasmobranch catches also showed a peak of 8.2% in 2008. In the 

remaining years this proportion ranged from 0.8% to 3.4%. These values are much 

lower than those observed by Lessa et al. (1999a), in an experimental survey of 

pelagic fishes conducted between 1992 and 1997 in the southwestern equatorial 

Atlantic, where the whitetip catches represented almost 30% of all 

elasmobranchs, being the second most abundant shark, outnumbered only by the 

blue shark (Prionace glauca).

2010. Crosses represent squares with effort and zero catch. 
 

The results, however, are not comparable, due to the operational differences in 

the fishing gear and methods used by the experimental and the commercial 

operations, the first ones having operated in much shallower layers, where the 

species is known to be much more frequently caught (Bromhead et al., 2012; 

Nakano et al., 1997). More recent results, obtained with the use of PSAT tags 

 44 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

(Pop-up satellite archival tags), have confirmed that this species is largely confined 

to the uniform temperature surface layer (Musyl et al., 2011). Off northwest Brazil 

the thermocline is as shallow as 50 m deep (Travassos et al., 1999). 

 

Besides the depth of fishing, there are several other factors that may directly 

influence the catchability of a fish species in the longline fishery, thus altering the 

relationship between its catch rate (CPUE) and its actual abundance. Hazin et al. 

(1998), for instance, described marked fluctuations in the CPUE of several species, 

including the oceanic whitetip shark, over a period of many years, due to 

modifications in fishing strategy, such as changes on target species, discovery of 

new fishing grounds and introduction of new fishing technologies. Burgess et al. 

(2005), in turn, reported that the material of the branch line (nylon or steel), as 

well as the size, type and depth of the hook can greatly influence the catchability 

of shark species. They also indicated that market changes might modify the target 

species of the fishery, directly interfering, therefore, in the catchability of the 

species caught. In the present case, as well, the changes of CPUE over the years 

can probably be explained, at least in part, by changes in fishing strategies, 

especially related to longline configuration of the different flags that were active 

during the study period, as the models indicated.

The total length of the 1612 individuals measured ranged from 50 to 320 cm, in 

males, and from 50 to 311 cm, in females. The majority of males and females were 

between 100 and 180 cm TL (Figure 7), with 78% having less than 180 cm and 

were probably juvenile, according to Lessa et al. (1999b). Of the 1218 specimens 

sexed, 653 were female and 565 were male, resulting in a sex ratio of 1:0.86 

(female: male) significantly different from 1:1 (p = 0.0117). These values were very 

close to those found by other studies carried out in the same area, although in 

most cases the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1 (Lessa et al., 

1999a,b; Asano-Filho et al., 2004; García-Cortéz and Mejuto, 2002; Coelho et al., 

2009). This could be explained by the much lower sample sizes of these studies. 

 

 
F i g u r e  7 .  Length–frequency distribution of oceanic whitetip sharks caught in the

Lessa et al. (1999b) suggested, based on a small individual caught with fresh 

umbilical scars, that the size at birth is around 70 cm TL. Coelho et al. (2009) found 

near-term embryos measuring 52 cm, and therefore hypothesized that the size at 

birth should be around 55 and 65 cm, as proposed by Compagno (1984). The 

three individuals measuring 50 cm TL found in the present work, however, 

indicate that the size at birth might be even smaller than previously reported.

Previous studies indicated that a geographical segregation by sex might occur for 

oceanic whitetip shark (Backus et al., 1956; Strasburg, 1958). In the present study 

the hypothesis of sex and area being independent was rejected (p = 0.0409), 

which could also indicate that a geographical segregation by sex might occur in 

the study area (Figure 8). The evidence for such segregation, however, is not very 

strong as the hypothesis of independence was only marginally rejected. 

 

 
F i g u r e  8 .  Spatial distribution of males and females oceanic whitetip sharks caught 
between 2005 and 2009. 
 

Coelho et al. (2009) suggested that the high percentage of small individuals in the 

southwestern equatorial Atlantic, also found in the present work, might indicate 

segregation by size in the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, Lessa et al. (1999a and b) 

hypothesized that the large proportion of juveniles might be a result of 

continuous fishing pressure on the entire population. Nonetheless, in order to 

clarify this matter data from a much longer time series and a much broader 

geographical coverage of the Atlantic Ocean are necessary. 

 47 



Chapter 3: Oceanic whitetip sharks caught by the Brazilian longline fleet 

The spatial distribution of the 5° square mean lengths (Figure 9) shows a 

concentration of larger specimens from about 020°W to 035°W and from 5°S to 

15°S. Another area of concentration of larger specimens seems to be present to 

the north of the equator and just off north of Brazil. 

 

This study has shown the catch rates of the oceanic whitetip shark are very 

sensitive to changes in fishing strategy and gear, especially to those related with 

hook depth. It is also clear that the great majority of catches from this species in 

the southwestern equatorial Atlantic are composed of juveniles. These results 

indicate that efficient conservation measures need to be adopted and that 

mitigation methods, such as promoting deep hooks by longliners, should be 

particularly investigated.

Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

A b s t r a c t  
The interaction between oceanic whitetip sharks (OCS) and the purse seine fishery 
in the eastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans was analyzed, in order to 
investigate the potential of using this fishery’s database to derive abundance 
indices and determine population trends for the species. Observer data from the 
French purse seine fleet combined with a historic Indian Ocean database from the 
Soviet Union were used in the analyses. In the Atlantic the time series ranged from 
1995 to 2014, while in the Indian Ocean the combined time series spanned from 
1986 to 2014. A well-marked change on the proportion of Fishing Aggregating 
Devices (FADs) with the presence of oceanic whitetip sharks in the Indian Ocean 
was observed, fluctuating around 20% from mid 80’s to mid 90’s and dropping to 
less than 10% as from 2005. The changes on the OCS/FAD proportion along the 
years show a clear link between the two distinct databases from this ocean. The 
results indicate that the proportion of FADs with OCS could be relevant when 
deriving abundance trends for the species from multiple data sources. Occurrence 
rates were lower in the Atlantic when compared to the Indian Ocean. No marked 
temporal trends were observed for this ocean. Results might indicate that the 
oceanic whitetip population is more severely impacted in the eastern Atlantic 
Ocean, since this area has been industrially exploited for longer. 
 

1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  
 

The oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a pelagic predator widely 

distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of all oceans (Compagno, 1984). It is 

easily distinguishable from the other species of the Carcharhinidae family by the 

round shape of its long pectoral and dorsal fins, as well as by the white stains in 

their margins. The species is commonly caught as bycatch by a variety of pelagic 

fishing gears, such as tuna longlines, gillnets, and purse seines (Bonfil et al., 2008).  

 

Concerns regarding the conservation of oceanic whitetips started to rise 

substantially in the past decade due to increasing fishing pressure throughout the 

species range, associated with an acute lack of both knowledge and adequate 

monitoring of their catches (Baum et al., 2006). As a result, Tuna Regional 

Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) from all oceans decided to ban 

 52 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

landings, storing, and selling of the oceanic whitetip shark (International 

Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna Rec. 10-07; Inter-American 

Tropical Tuna Commission Rec. C-11-10; Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 

Commission CMM 11-04; Indian Ocean Tuna Commission Res. 13-06). The OCS 

has also been recently included in CITES appendix II (March 2013, CoP16 Prop. 

42). 

 

All of these measures, including the recent listing on CITES appendix II, were 

taken under the precautionary approach concept and represent a first step 

towards the conservation of OCS worldwide. Knowledge gaps concerning the 

species ecology and biology are still wide, imposing a barrier on the development 

of mitigation measures for fisheries and accurate stock assessment. 

 

The oceanic whitetip shark is believed to have been more severely impacted by 

pelagic longlines, as its catch rates are usually higher in fisheries using this fishing 

gear (Rice and Harley, 2012). As a result, the interactions of the species with 

pelagic longlines have been more often investigated (Cortés et al., 2010; Semba 

and Yokawa, 2011; Tolotti et al., 2013; Walsh et al., 2009). In the purse seine 

fishery, on the other hand, these interactions received much less attention. The 

work presented here is a first look on how this species interacts with the purse 

seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans. The goal is also to 

investigate the potential of using this fishery’s database to derive abundance 

indices and determine population trends for the oceanic whitetip shark in the 

global pelagic realm.

Data from 10,441 purse seine sets conducted by the French tuna fleet in the 

eastern Atlantic and western Indian oceans were analyzed. The time series 

 53 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

includes data from the mid 90’s, starting in 1995, up until 2014. In the Indian, 

however, no data was collected between the years of 1997 and 2005. Sets cover a 

large area of both oceans (Figures 1 and 2). In the Atlantic Ocean, the fishing area 

is roughly limited by the latitudes of 20°N and 05°S and by the African coast and 

the longitude of 025°W. In the Indian Ocean, the fishing is roughly limited by the 

latitudes of 05°N to 20°S and by the longitudes of 070°E to 040°E. All French data 

comes from scientific observer programs, either conducted within the framework 

of specific European Union (EU) research projects in the 1990s and early 2000s, or 

since 2005, within continuous data collection programs under the European Data 

Collection Regulations (Council Regulation no. 1543/2000, Commission 

Regulation no. 1581/2004, Council Regulation no. 199/2008, and Commission 

Decision 2008/949/EC). All observer programs were developed under the same 

main objectives (Amandè et al., 2012; Bourjea et al., 2014). 

 

On-board observers were evenly distributed to cover the four quarters of the year. 

They collected information regarding all fishing activities, including bycatch 

estimations and size frequencies by species. Each set was recorded on an exact 

geographic position basis and divided into two distinct fishing strategies, sets on 

Free Swimming Schools (FSC) and sets on Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD). Sets 

on both natural and man-made devices were recorded under the same FAD 

category. Whale-associated sets were treated as free-school sets and sets on 

whale sharks were pooled with FAD sets. All collected information is gathered in a 

common database managed by the Observatoire Thonier, from where the data 

presented here was extracted. These observer programs were estimated to cover 

10% of the French purse seine sets in the Atlantic and around 9% in the Indian 

Ocean (Amandè et al., 2012; Bourjea et al., 2014).

Additional historic data were incorporated into the analyses in order to investigate 

possible changes on population trends. A total of 497 purse seine sets conducted 

by the Soviet Union (USSR) were analyzed. These fishing operations were carried 

out between 1986 and 1992 and data was collected by scientific on-board 

observers in the scope of various programs developed by regional fisheries 

research institutes and affiliated organizations. Database was developed within 

the framework of YugNIRO1 research activities in the Indian Ocean. The USSR sets 

fall inside the area covered by the French database in the Indian Ocean, roughly 

ranging from 05°N to 10°S and form 070°E to 050°E (Figure 3). Some fishing sets 

were also made in the northeastern portion of the Mozambique Channel. Each set 

was also recorded on an exact position basis. For comparison purposes with the

The interaction between oceanic whitetip sharks (OCS) and the tropical purse 

seine fisheries was analyzed in terms of occurrence per set, not taking into 

account the number of OCS caught per set but only the presence of the species in 

a set. For the spatial analysis, sets were grouped into 5°x°5 squares of latitude and 

longitude. The two datasets were analyzed separately and then compared. To 

facilitate the comparison, some figures combine the two but their origin is always 

indicated. A general summary that includes total catches is also provided.

Of the 7,102 sets analyzed from the French fleet in the Atlantic Ocean, 65% were 

done on FSC and 35% were done on FADs (Table 1). On the first two years of the 

time series (1995 and 96), sets on FSC were unanimity and on the following years 

a gradual increase of sets on FAD was observed (Figure 4). Even with an increase 

on FAD sets, the overall pattern was the predominance of FSC sets. FAD sets only 

predominated over FSC sets in 2005 and 2006. These years, however, up until 

2009, were characterized by very low sampling efforts (Figure 4). The effort was 

considerably higher in 1998, exceeding 1400 sets, and in 2014, when it reached 

four digits again. The high number of fishing sets in 2014 is due to the 

implementation of 100% observer coverage in this ocean. 

 

Both fishing strategies share the same geographical area, with sets concentrating 

in the equatorial zone between the parallels of 05°N and 05°S (Figure 1). 

Regarding FSC sets, three hotspots are observed: one between the coast of 

Ghana and the equator, one just above the equator and between the meridians of 

020°W and 015°W, and one just off the coast of Gabon. An important 

 57 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

concentration of FSC sets is also observed up north, just off the coast of 

Mauritania and delimited by the latitude of 20°N. FAD sets were mostly 

concentrated in the five degree square just off Gabon, especially during the 2nd 

and 3rd quarters of the year. The areas off Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana also 

concentrated a considerable amount of FAD sets, especially on the 1st quarter.

Of the 3,339 sets analyzed from the French fleet in the Indian Ocean, 32% were 

done on FSC and 68% were done on FADs (Table 1). The proportion of the two 

fishing strategies varied considerably along the years, but, with the exception of 

2005 and 2007, sets on FADs were always predominant (Figure 5). The number of 

observed sets also showed a great deal of variation throughout the time series 

and very low effort was recorded for the years 1996 and 2005 (Figure 5). These 

low numbers of observed sets are due to transition periods between observer 

programs in this ocean. Sampling effort was considerably high on 1995, 2009, 

2010 and 2014. 

 

Regarding the spatial distribution of sets, both fishing strategies shared the same 

area (Figure 2). Two effort hot spots are observed for sets on FADs, one inside the 

Mozambique Channel and another one right around the Equator (from 05° north 

to south) and between the meridians of 045° and 055° east. The sets on the 

Mozambique Channel are seasonal, occurring mildly on the 1st quarter of the year 

and also on the 2nd, when it reaches its peak. There are no sets in the 

Mozambique Channel during the 3rd and 4th quarters. Still concerning the 

Channel, the number of sets was remarkably high in 2009 and 2010 when 

compared with the other years of the time series. Sets on FSC were more frequent 

in the area bonded by the 05°S and the 10°S parallels and by the 050°E and 

060°E meridians.

In the Soviet Union database the number of sets per fishing strategy was more 

proportionately balanced, with 259 out of 497 sets done on FADs and 238 on FSC 

(52% and 48%, respectively – Table 1). This proportion also varied along the years, 

but remained relatively balanced for most part of the time series (Figure 5). The 

 59 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

exceptions were the years 1989, when almost 100% of observed sets were on 

FSC, and 1991, when no FSC sets were observed. Some variation is seen on the 

number of observed sets throughout the time series, but not as pronounced as 

seen on the French database (Figure 5). Sampling effort below average is seen on 

1988 and 1992. 

 

Sets of both fishing strategies were done on the same area, with FAD sets being 

more widely spread (Figure 3). The latter strategy was more frequently observed 

along a “corridor” between 050°E and 065°E, ranging from the Equator up to 

05°N and down to 10°S in the squares bounded by 060°E and 065°E. Sets on FSC 

were mostly concentrated in the square between the Equator and the 05°S 

parallel and between the 060°E and 065°E meridians. Fishing sets in the 

Mozambique Channel were only observed during its peak season on the 2nd 

quarter of the year. Both FSC and FAD sets were observed inside the channel, 

with a great predominance of sets on FADs.

From the 7,102 sets observed in the Atlantic Ocean only 90 had the presence of 

OCS (Table 1). Most sharks were caught on FAD sets, totaling 106 OCS or 63%, 

while the remaining 37% (63 sharks) were caught on FSC sets. The number of 

OCS caught on FSC sets seems high, but it is important to note that sets on FSCs 

in this ocean were almost twice more observed then sets on FADs (65% against 

35%). Proportionally, the total OCS catch represented only 1% of FSC sets against 

4% of FAD sets (Table 1). 

 

For every set on a free swimming school only 0.01 oceanic whitetip sharks were 

present. For FAD sets the proportion of OCS occurrence was slightly higher, 

representing 2% of these sets. Looking at each year individually a marked trend 

was not evident for neither of the fishing strategies (Figure 6). However, values 

tended to decrease slightly over the observed years. On FAD sets the highest 

proportion value occurred in 1997 (5%) and the lowest value occurred in 2014 

(0.2%). This declining trend was not constant either and some zero values also 

occurred in between. A declining trend is clearer for the OCS proportion on FSC 

sets (Figure 6). The highest value occurred in 1995 (6%) and the lowest occurred 

(0.3%). Despite the great number of observed FSC sets, the presence of OCS was 

rarely recorded and zero values occurred more frequently than on FAD sets. 

 

On FAD sets, the presence of OCS was most frequently recorded in the area just 

above and just below the 10°N parallel (Figure 7). Occurrence hotspots were 

observed in this area in the 2nd and 4th quarters, a seasonal pattern, however, is 

not clear. OCS occurrences along the equator were mainly observed during the 

1st quarter. Overall, catches were highly dispersed over the fishing area and 5 

degrees squares with zero occurrences were abundant during the four quarters of 

the year. Occurrences on FSC sets were even more dispersed than on FAD sets 

 61 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

(Figure 8). The main difference between the two strategies was the lack of OCS 

occurrences on FSC sets in the area around the 10°N parallel. For this strategy, 

catches along the equator were more frequent in the 4th quarter.

Compared with the Atlantic, oceanic whitetip sharks were more frequently caught 

in the Indian Ocean. A total of 165 sets were recorded with the presence of OCS, 

and a total of 297 oceanic whitetip sharks were caught on both fishing strategies 

(Table 1). Most of OCS catches came from FAD sets, but the species catches on 

FSC sets were not negligible as 16% of sharks were caught with this fishing

Overall, OCS was present in 3% of FSC sets and in 6% of FAD sets. Along the 

years, the proportion on FAD sets varied and a marked change was observed 

between mid 90’s and the rest of the time series (Figure 9). The proportion of 

FADs with the presence of OCS went somewhere from 20 to less then 10%

between these two periods. The exception is a peak in 2011 and minor one in 

2014. Another remark is the extremely low values, way below 5%, seen in 2009 

and 2010. The presence of OCS on FSC sets did not vary as much, remaining 

below 5% for most of the time series (Figure 9). A very high value is seen in 1995, 

but this must be regarded with caution since it is derived from a low sample size, 

only 9 sets. Interestingly, high proportion peaks are also seen in 2011 and 2014.

Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

Contrary to what was observed in the Atlantic Ocean, the catches of OCS on FADs 

was highly associated with the equatorial zone and there were no catch records of 

the species above 10°N and very few below 10°S (Figure 10). Even with the 

considerably high effort on the Mozambique Channel during the 2nd quarter, the 

presence of OCS in this area was very weak. A seasonal pattern is not evident. 

Overall, occurrences were more frequently recorded on the 1st and 3rd quarters. 

The big 10 degrees square off Tanzania and Kenya and up to 050°E is an area 

with frequent occurrences all year round, with the exception of the 4th quarter. 

Catches on FSC were also more frequent on the equatorial zone, although more 

occurrences were recorded below the 10°S parallel (Figure 11). The species was 

more present on FSC sets during the 2nd and 4th quarters, but the highest 

occurrence level was observed on the 3rd. This “hotspot” also needs to be looked 

at with caution as observed fishing effort in this square is very low, only 2 sets. 

 

3 . 2 . 2 .  I n d i a n  O c e a n  –  U S S R  d a t a b a s e  

 

From the historic data, 57 sets were recorded with the presence of OCS, totaling 

195 oceanic whitetip sharks caught on both fishing strategies (Table 1). The 

presence of OCS was also more frequent on FAD sets, representing 90% of the 

total number of sharks caught. Combining the years, OCS was present in 5% of 

FSC sets and in 17% of FAD sets. The proportion of FADs with OCS did not vary a 

great deal throughout the time series, remaining at around 20% (Figure 7). The 

year of 1987 was the exception showing a value below 10%. No sharks were 

caught on FADs in 1988 and 1989, which could be explained by the low sample 

size of these years. The presence of OCS on FSC sets exhibited a crescent trend, 

varying from 3% in 1986 to 16% in 1990 (Figure 7). Despite the reasonable 

sample size in 1989, no OCS catch was reported for this year. A zero catch 

scenario is also seen in 1992.

Spatially, the presence of OCS on FAD sets varied between the quarters of the 

year, which might suggest a seasonal effect (Figure 12). The species was much 

more frequent on FAD sets from the second half of the year (3rd and 4th 

quarters). A similar spatial pattern is seen in these two quarters as their higher 

proportion squares occur in the same area. These squares are located along the 

Equator, up to 05°N, from the 050°E to the 065°E meridians. The Mozambique 

Channel was not heavily sampled as on the French database, but the few sets

Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

conducted on the 2nd quarter resulted on a few OCS catches. The occurrence of 

OCS on FSC sets is very low and dispersed across the fishing area, which prevents 

the identification of spatial patterns (Figure 13). On most of the 5 degrees squares 

where FSC sets were observed no OCS catch was recorded.

4 .  D i s c u s s i o n  
 

The oceanic whitetip shark is believed to associate with floating objects. This 

statement is supported by catch data from tuna purse seine fisheries setting on 

floating objects, either natural or man-made (Clarke et al., 2013; Torres-Irineo et 

FAD SETS 1st 3rd 

2nd 4th 

 69 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

al., 2014). The species is the second mostly caught shark by the tropical tuna 

purse seine fishery and its catch rates are considerably higher on FAD sets 

(Amandè et al., 2012; Santana et al., 1998; Stretta et al., 1998). This pattern, 

revealing an associative behavior around drifting objects, was observed on both 

French and USSR databases. Still, the number of OCS caught with free-swimming 

tuna schools was meaningful, constituting at least 10% of total OCS catch in the 

Indian Ocean and reaching 37% in the Atlantic. This result indicates that the 

association of oceanic whitetip sharks with free-swimming tuna schools does not 

seem to be a random event, as, although not often, it occurs systematically. 

 

When looking at the Indian Ocean database as a whole, historic and recent, a 

well-marked change on the proportion of FADs with the presence of oceanic 

whitetip sharks is seen on the time series chart (Figure 9). From mid 80’s to mid 

90’s this proportion fluctuated around 20% and dropped to less than 10% as from 

2005. There are a few odd high and lows, but, as the general pattern is quite 

evident, this could be a result of noise due to variations on sample size and area. 

Taking into account that the number of FADs has greatly increased since the 90’s 

(Dagorn et al., 2013b; Maufroy et al., 2015), the decrease in the proportion of 

FADs with OCS by more than 10% could indicate an important population 

decline. Following the simple line of thought that a greater number of FADs 

would increase the chances of an OCS finding and associating with one, we would 

expect to see an increase on the proportion of FADs with the species (assuming, 

of course, the population size remained stable) (Sempo et al., 2013). The data, 

however, shows that this is not the case. The populations of oceanic whitetip 

sharks are believed to have suffered substantial declines in the Atlantic and Pacific 

Oceans (Baum and Blanchard, 2010; Rice and Harley, 2012). Similar studies have 

not been conducted in the Indian Ocean, but the results presented here might 

indicate a similar scenario. Additionally, a preliminary analysis conducted on catch 

and effort data from the Japanese longline fishery also suggested that OCS 

population is showing signs of decline in the western Indian Ocean (Semba and 

Yokawa, 2011).

from the Soviet Union historic surveys (USSR) conducted between 1986 and 1992. The 
crosses represent squares where sets were observed but no OCS capture was reported. 
 

Another possible interpretation for the decline of OCS occurrence per FAD in the 

Indian Ocean could be a sharp increase on FAD densities combined with a small 

and stable population size. In this scenario, the proportion OCS/FAD would 

simply decrease because there are not enough sharks to aggregate around that 

many FADs. The analyzed data does not provide a straightforward interpretation, 

as both hypotheses seem plausible. However, when considering the population 

declines caused by the increased fishing pressure in other oceans and that the 

FSC SETS 1st 3rd 

2nd 4th 

 71 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

fishing pressure also increased greatly in the Indian Ocean, this second scenario 

seems less likely. In any case, a thorough analysis taking other factors into 

account, especially FAD density trends, is necessary to draw more definite 

conclusions. Studies on the associative behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks around 

floating objects, like what has been done with silky sharks (Filmalter et al., 2015), 

are also crucial. 

 

The data shown on Figure 9 comes from two distinct databases (USSR and 

French), yet the changes on the OCS/FAD proportion along the years show a clear 

link between them. Proportions derived from the early years of the French 

database are at the same magnitude order of the proportions derived from the 

historic database (USSR). This indicates that this index (proportion of FADs with 

OCS) could be relevant when deriving trends from multiple data sources. The 

proportion of sets on FSC with the presence of oceanic whitetip seems to have 

decreased between historic and recent data, however this change was minor and 

a well-defined trend is not evident. As discussed above, the capture of OCS on 

free swimming schools in not negligible, but still is very sparse. Being an index 

derived from a less frequent event, the proportion of OCS on FSC sets is more 

subject to noise than the proportion on FAD sets, making it more difficult to pick 

up trends and requiring a much bigger sample size. This issue becomes more 

evident when looking at the spatial distributions of the occurrence of OCS/FSC 

sets on Figures 11 and 13. Surely that when deriving population estimates from 

catch and effort data all sources of catch must be taken into account. However, 

when it comes to deriving indices and examining trends the focus should be on 

FAD sets. 

 

Seasonal patterns could not be distinguished when looking at the distributions of 

oceanic whitetip occurrences per set. The data, however, indicates that there is a 

spatial component to be considered in the Indian Ocean. The Mozambique 

Channel was heavily sampled on the French database, but both total catch and 

occurrence rate were very low in this area (Figures 10 and 11). The extremely low 

 72 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

values of FADs with OCS seen in Figure 9 seem to be influenced by this spatial 

component. In the years in question, 2009 and 2010, the number of sets inside 

the Channel was around 6 times higher than the other years. Since the species is 

less observed in purse seiners catches in this area, these high effort values pulled 

the OCS/FAD proportion down. This is an interesting result to be investigated 

further, specially considering that the Mozambique Channel is an area with great 

density of floating objects (Dagorn et al., 2013a). 

 

Oceanic whitetip sharks were less frequently caught in the Atlantic than in the 

Indian Ocean (Table 1). Only 2% of the FAD sets in this ocean had the presence of 

an OCS, as opposed to 6% for the same period in the Indian Ocean. This low 

proportion ranged from the beginning to the end of the time series and, although 

a slight decrease seems to have occurred, no marked trend was observed. The 

low rate of occurrence and the lack of a marked trend hamper a discussion 

concerning the time evolution of the abundance of the species in the eastern 

Atlantic and leaves unanswered questions. Has the OSC population in the western 

Indian Ocean always been bigger or are the lower proportion values in the 

Atlantic a result of a high fishing pressure over a longer period? Large-scale 

longline vessels started exploring the Atlantic in the late 1950’s and purse seine 

vessels have been fishing for tuna off topical West Africa since the 1960’s, while in 

the Indian Ocean large-scale fisheries developed slower, only reaching big 

proportions in the 1980’s (Miyake et al., 2004). The eastern Atlantic has been 

under big fishing pressure for longer, thus the OCS population might have been 

bigger before the 90’s and at comparable levels with the western Indian Ocean. 

The analysis of historic data is crucial to elucidate this matter. Another question 

that can be asked is if the associative behavior of OCS is the same between the 

two oceans. Maybe, the proportion of OCS on FAD sets in the Atlantic are lower 

simply because they associate less on floating objects than in the Indian Ocean. 

This highlights the importance of understanding the species behavior around 

FADs. 

 

 73 



Chapter 4: Oceanic whitetip sharks and the purse seine fishery 

Using longline data to derive bycatch population trends is typically problematic, 

as small variations on gear type and fishing strategy can greatly impact the 

catchability of a species and interfere on the relationship between its catch rate 

and its actual abundance (Ward, 2008). Abundance trends for the oceanic 

whitetip have been heavily questioned due to standardization problems (Baum et 

al., 2003; Burgess et al., 2005) and question marks still remain regarding the 

species population status. The proportion of FADs with the presence of oceanic 

whitetip sharks could potentially provide a simple abundance trend index, with 

the advantage of a probably lower catchability bias when compared to pelagic 

longline catches. To further investigate population size trends for the endangered 

OCS derived from the purse seine fishery, however, key information on the 

evolution of FAD densities is required. Knowledge on the associative behavior of 

this species, in particular the time they spend at floating objects and the time 

between two associations, is also essential.

Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 

A b s t r a c t  
A combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was used to assess 
the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline fisheries. The 
Brazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and southwestern 
Atlantic, is used as a case study. Fisheries dependent data include information 
from logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-board observers (2004 to 2010), 
totaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries independent data were obtained 
from 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags in the 
area where longline fleet operated. Deployment periods varied from 60 to 178 
days between 2010 and 2012. Tagging and pop-up sites were relatively close to 
each other, although individuals tended to travel long distances before returning 
to the tagging area. Some degree of site fidelity was observed. High utilization 
hotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the area under strongest fishing pressure. 
Despite the small sample size, a positive correlation between tag recorded 
information and catch data was detected. All sharks exhibited a strong preference 
for the warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more 
than 70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. Results 
indicate that the removal of shallow hooks on longline gear might be an efficient 
mitigation measure to reduce the bycatch of this pelagic shark species. The work 
also highlights the potential of tagging experiments to provide essential 
information for the development of spatio-temporal management measures. 
 

1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  
 

The oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus, OCS) is a tropical predator 

[1,2] commonly taken as bycatch in pelagic fisheries using longlines, gillnets, and 

purse seines [3]. Inadequate monitoring hampers the assessment of stock status 

for this species, but there is a broad consensus that populations are decreasing 

[4,5]. Concerns regarding the conservation of oceanic whitetips have risen 

substantially during the past decade due to increasing fishing pressure 

throughout the species range and inadequate catch monitoring, associated with 

an acute lack 	 of knowledge on the behavior and ecology of the species. In 
response to an evident, and in some cases drastic, decline of abundance trends, 

Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), responsible for the 

management of tuna fisheries and associated species, adopted a series of strong 

 78 



Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 

measures to bolster conservation efforts for the oceanic whitetip shark 

(International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna Rec. 10–07; Inter- 

American Tropical Tuna Commission Rec. C-11-10; Western and Central Pacific 

Fisheries CommissionCMM11–04; Indian Ocean Tuna Commission Res. 13–06). 

These measures essentially banned the take of oceanic whitetip sharks by 

prohibiting the retention, landing or storing of the whole carcass or any part 

thereof. The oceanic whitetip is the only pelagic shark species covered by such 

measures across all oceans. The species was also recently included in CITES 

appendix II (March 2013, CoP16 Prop. 42). 

 

Under current fishing practices, however, the incidental capture of this species is 

difficult to be avoided. Furthermore, many individuals are dead or dying by the 

time the fishing gear is retrieved. As such, the measures currently in place do little 

to alleviate fishing mortality, which continues to impact oceanic whitetip 

populations across all oceans. The development of mitigation measures capable 

of not only reducing their catch rates but also increasing their post-release survival 

are therefore crucial for improving population levels [6]. In ecological terms, the 

vulnerability of a species depends upon two factors: the sensitivity of the species 

to an external factor and how extensive the exposure to this hazard is [7,8]. Shark 

species are known to have low rebound capacities resulting directly from their life 

history traits of slow growth, late maturation and low fecundity. These biological 

characteristics make this group much more sensitive to overexploitation than 

teleost fishes [9–11]. 

 

The present study assesses the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark by 

analyzing the extent of its fishing exposure (accessibility) to pelagic longline 

fisheries. The Brazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and 

southwestern Atlantic, is used as a case study. The overall goal is to provide 

information needed to aid in the design of management measures and improve 

conservation efforts for this species. Both fisheries dependent (fisheries logbooks, 

observers) and independent (electronic tags) datasets were used as 

 79 



Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 

complementary sources of information. This integrating approach provided a 

better understanding of the interactions between oceanic sharks and this fishery. 

Vulnerability was assessed with regard to both spatial dynamics (horizontal) and 

depth distribution (vertical) of both sharks and longline gear, taking into 

consideration seasonality and strategies in the fishery.

A total of 11 oceanic whitetip sharks were tagged with pop-up satellite archival 

tags (PAT), manufactured by Wildlife Computers (Redmond, USA), in the South 

Atlantic Ocean. From these, 7 reported data to the satellites as scheduled, 1 

reported prematurely and 3 never reported (Table 1). Two models of PAT were 

used: 7 MK10s and 4 miniPATs, with all of the non-reporting tags being Mk10s. 

Both models were set to collect data on depth, water temperature and ambient 

light level (for estimation of geolocation) every 10 seconds. The Mk10, however, 

only transmitted a summary of that data in the form of depth and temperature 

histograms, while the MiniPATs transmitted time series data at a resolution of 5 

minutes. 

 

The first two Mk10 tags (AOCS1 and AOCS2) were programmed to summarize 

the collected data into one-hour histograms while all others were set to generate 

six-hour histograms. One MK10 was recovered (AOCS3) allowing the complete 

time series, with 10-second resolution, to be accessed. The miniPATs were 

programmed to transmit only depth time series data and not temperature.

Temperature data were received as a daily histogram (24 hours). Both tag models 

transmitted light data in the form of two daily light curves (representing dawn and 

dusk) that were used to reconstruct geographic positions. The MiniPATs and the 

recovered MK10 also provided a daily analysis of the surface mixed layer depth 

and the amount of time the tagged shark spent therein. 

 

All OCS were caught off the Northeast coast of Brazil by a commercial tuna 

longliner and tagging was conducted by an on-board observer with the help of 

the crew. Sharks were brought onboard to be measured and tagged and were out 

of the water for no longer than five minutes prior to release. Tags were attached at 

the base of the first dorsal fin using a loop of polyamide monofilament (2.0 mm) 

passed through a silicon tube, to minimize friction related injuries. Tagging 

locations were recorded using the vessel’s global positioning system (GPS).

Depth data were analyzed in relation to the different periods of the day to account 

for diel movement patterns. Day, night, dawn and dusk data were grouped 

according to local times, which were estimated using the calculation procedure 

available from NOAA (http://www.srrb. noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/sunrise.html). 

Data from the Mk10 tag that were summarized into six-hour histograms could not 

be grouped. Day was defined as the period between sunrise and sunset, and 

night as the period between astronomical dusk and astronomical dawn. Dusk 

comprised the hours between sunset and astronomical dusk, while dawn 

comprised the hours between astronomical dawn and sunrise. To compare 

daytime and nighttime depth 	 distributions, Pearson’s chi-squared test was 
performed at 95% confidence level. Crepuscular periods (dawn and dusk) were 

omitted from this analysis.

The horizontal movements of tagged sharks were estimated by processing the 

data received from the Argos satellite system using the manufacturer light-based 

geolocation software (WC-GPE: Global Position Estimator Program suite, available 

at: www.wildlifecomputers. com). Longitude is estimated from the time of local 

noon and latitude from the length of the day through the dawn and dusk 

symmetry method. In order to minimize the errors usually associated to this 

geolocation estimation [12,13], the tracks were post-processed using the IKNOS 

Walk model [14]. In this approach, tracks are corrected and interpolated at fixed 

intervals by bootstrapping random walk particles. The locations are estimated 

from a cloud of weighted particles and corrections can be applied based on 

known constraints or available data. 

 

In the present study, the tracks were interpolated to obtain one position a day and 

were prevented from crossing land. A maximum speed threshold was also 

implemented into the model. Starting from 3 km/h, several speeds were tested up 

to 10 km/h (by 1 km/h increments). The maximum speed of 9 km/h was selected 

based on the end point criteria, meaning this maximum speed was the slowest 

speed that allowed all tracks to end at the known pop-up point. The error around 

estimated positions is displayed by 50 alternative positions for each point, 

representing minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes. 

 

To estimate the areas of high utilization, a Two-Dimensional Kernel Density 

Estimation was applied to the cloud of alternative points (error). Data from all 

individuals were combined in this analysis, conducted using the MASS package 

[15] in the R environment [16]. The bandwidth was chosen via Normal Reference 

Distribution. In order to expose areas of high utilization, density values smaller 

than 0.01 were excluded from the plot.

Fishing effort data from the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1999 and 2011, 

totaling 65,277 sets, were used to assess the vulnerability of oceanic whitetip 

sharks to this fishery. The Brazilian fleet operates in a wide area of the equatorial 

and southwestern Atlantic Ocean and uses two distinct fishing strategies 

commonly referred to as “Japanese” (JAP) and “Spanish” (SPA). In general, 

vessels fishing with the Spanish strategy target swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and set 

surface longlines (down to 100 m) at night, using light sticks and squid as bait. 

Alternatively, vessels fishing with the Japanese strategy target various tuna 

species and set deep longlines (down to more than 200 m) early in the morning, 

using small pelagic fish as bait (mainly mackerel) [17]. Fishing effort was 

represented by the number of hooks deployed, grouped into 5° squares for 

spatial analyses. 

 

Nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data were analyzed to account for possible 

seasonal variations. A subsample of the dataset previously analyzed by Tolotti et 

al. [17] was considered for this purpose. This dataset was collected by the 

Brazilian Observer Program from foreign-chartered tuna longline vessels between 

2004 and 2010. Spatial bounds for this data were selected based on the shark 

high utilization areas (from tag data), as well as on the area where the fishing 

effort was concentrated. The CPUE represented the number of OCS/1,000 hooks 

per quarter. Mean values were calculated using the sum of all catch and all effort 

in each quarter. Data were also grouped according to the fishing strategy. Two-

sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used for inter-quarter comparisons at a 

95% confidence level.  

 

To evaluate the spatial overlap between fisheries and tagging data precisely, it 

would be necessary to use a CPUE index that accounts for the depth distribution 

of the hooks. In the absence of such data, an occurrence index was adopted. For 

this analysis, data were also grouped into 5° squares and by quarter. For each 

 84 



Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 
 

	

square, the number of sets with the presence of OCS were summed and then 

divided by the total number of observed sets. The occurrence values were then 

paired with the Kernel densities (also grouped by quarters and 5°×5° squares). 

For each square, density values were summed. A Spearman's Rank test was 

conducted to verify possible correlation between fisheries and tagging data 

(occurrence and Kernel density). The non-parametric Spearman's Rank was 

chosen after verifying that the two datasets did not conform to a bivariate normal 

distribution (Royston's Multivariate Normality Test, p = 9.217239e-06).

were almost entirely received (86.2% and 99.0% of general and geolocation data, 

respectively). The MK10 tags varied considerably in their reporting rates, and

Oceanic whitetip sharks exhibited a strong preference for warm and shallow 

waters. Tagged sharks remained at temperatures between 24 and 30°C for 

approximately 96% of the monitoring period (Figure 1). The time spent inside the 

mixed layer was very similar for all sharks, regardless of their size, and it varied 

between 70 and 83% (Table 3). AOCS4 and 7 entered the coldest waters of all 

tagged sharks. The minimum recorded temperatures were 8.2°C, with a 	
corresponding depth of 368 m, for AOCS4, and 8.8°C at 448 m, for AOCS7. The 

latter also represented the deepest recorded dive of this study.

All sharks were tagged close to the equator and although individuals tended to 

travel long distances the pop-up positions were relatively close to the tagging 

locations (Figures 2A and 2B). The individual AOCS6, for example, moved as far 

as 12,117 km during the tag deployment, but the distance between tagging and 

pop-up locations was only 145 km (Table 2). A similar pattern was observed on 

AOCS1, 3, 5 and 7. AOCS5 and 7 stayed within 500 km of the tagging position 

during most of their track, while AOCS1 remained in this range for the entirety of 

its monitoring period (Figure 3). AOCS3 made more extensive movements but 

returned to de 500 km range after 127 days at liberty (Figure 3). Only one shark 

made extended movements to the south (AOCS4), reaching latitudes below 10°S. 

This shark moved south shortly after tagging and did not return to the tagging 

area within the 141 days of monitoring. The last part of its track, however, shows a 

northward movement (Figure 2A). 

 

Total track lengths varied from 1,701 km, represented by the shortest deployment 

period (60 days), to 19,043 km, represented by the longest (178 days). Daily 

displacements varied considerably among sharks and ranged from 28 to

Between 1999 and 2011 the Brazilian tuna longline fleet deployed a total of 

102,201,242 hooks. The sets were widely distributed in the equatorial and 

southwestern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from 10°N to 65°S in latitude and from 

007°E to 055°W in longitude. The area with the highest effort concentration was 

bound by the 5°N and the 15°S parallels and by the 040°W and 035°W meridians 

(Figure 4). Despite the wide distribution of fishing sets, this area of highly 

concentrated effort is clearly evident. For both fishing strategies, SPA and JAP, 

most hooks were deployed within this area of concentrated effort. In contrast, the 

proportion of hooks deployed by fishing strategy varied considerably over time 

(Figure 5). From 1999 to 2002 the Japanese strategy accounted for the majority of 

hooks deployed, starting at 70% and gradually decreasing to 60%. From 2003 

onwards, the Spanish strategy was consistently dominant, although some 	
fluctuations were observed. During the years of 2008, 2009 and 2010 the 

Brazilian fleet consisted entirely of vessels fishing with Spanish strategy. 

 

Mean CPUE values were similar throughout the year with slight differences in the 

second quarter. Overall CPUE values ranged between 0.08 and 0.17 sharks/1000

Kernel densities were only estimated for the first two quarters of the year due to 

the concentration of tagging data during this period (Figure 7). The Kernel 

densities of combined tracks revealed two distinct areas of high utilization, one 

during each quarter of the year (Figure 8A). In the first quarter, high densities 

were concentrated very close to the Equator between the 035°W and the 030°W

parallels. During the second quarter the highest density values were located 

closer to the coast just off northeast Brazil above the Cabo Calcanhar. Both high-

utilization areas fall inside the high fishing effort zone, although second quarter 

sets were concentrated north of the OCS utilization hot spot (Figure 8B).

The spatial distribution of OCS occurrence differed between the first two quarters 

of the year. Overall, high occurrence values appeared in the area towards the 

north of the study zone in the 1st quarter, while in the 2nd quarter high values 

were located towards the south (Figure 8A). The square located just off Cabo 

Calcanhar was the only area that showed similar values during both quarters. The 

greatest difference was seen in the southernmost square, with zero occurrences in 

the 1st quarter and 0.16 OCS presences per set in the 2nd. 

 

A strong spatial correlation between occurrence and Kernel density estimation is 

not clearly evident in Figure 8A, although it is notable that high-density hotspots 

do fall inside squares with higher occurrence. Likewise, squares with very low 

occurrence (&lt;0.05) have none or very little utilization according with the Kernel 

density estimation. This apparent positive correlation was confirmed by the 

Spearman's rank test, which rejected the null hypothesis that kernel density values 

and CPUE were not correlated (Spearman's Rank Test, p= 0.02009, rho= 

0.5919304).

The vertical movements observed in the present study are in agreement with the 

existing literature, which describes the oceanic whitetip shark as an epipelagic 

predator of warm tropical waters [2] and places the species in the group of 

pelagic fishes that spend the majority of their time in the upper uniform-

temperature surface layer, rarely descending to waters below 20°C [18]. Through 

the use of electronic tags, two recent studies have also provided evidence to 

confirm these general statements. Musyl et al. [19], working near Hawaii, found 

that OCS were largely confined to the mixed layer (~120 m), spending&gt;95% of 

their time at temperatures within 2°C of the sea surface temperature (SST). OCS 

from the North Atlantic (Bahamas) exhibited a similar vertical pattern, essentially 

occupying the upper 125 m of the epipelagic zone at temperatures close to the 

SST [20].  

 

The oceanic whitetip shark’s strong preference for shallow and warm waters is 

also reflected on the depths of the longline hooks where the species is most 

commonly caught. Nakano et al. [21], for instance, concluded that the catch rates 

of OCS increased significantly with the decrease of hook depth. In a more specific 

study, data from the Brazilian longline fleet showed that the CPUE for OCS tended 

to be lower for the vessels targeting tuna, which operate with deeper longlines 

(down to 200 m), than those targeting swordfish, which operate with shallower 

gear (&gt;100 m) [17]. A sample of this data set, shown in Figure 7, further highlights 

the greater impact of the shallow Spanish fishing strategy on OCS CPUE values. 

This result comes with little surprise given that the depth range of the gear used in 

this fishing strategy corresponds exactly to the species vertical distribution. 

 

This vertical overlap is particularly concerning when the majority of the Brazilian 

fleet operates with shallow longlines exactly in the area where the species can be 

 96

most readily found. Although the proportion between the two fishing strategies 

(JAP-deep and SPA-shallow) in the Brazilian fleet varies considerably over the 

years, these fluctuations are mainly due to temporary fishing agreements between 

the Brazilian government and foreign companies [22]. The permanent Brazilian 

fleet, however, typically operates with shallow gear, primarily around the equator 

and close to seamounts [23], which means the vertical preferred habitat of the 

oceanic whitetip shark is extensively exploited. 

 

The results from the present study, combined with other recently published works, 

show that the vertical distribution of the oceanic whitetip shark is well defined. 

Despite the clear need for further data to fill the extensive knowledge gaps on the 

ecology of the species, this information is already of great importance for defining 

mitigation measures. A ban on retaining, landing, storing or selling this species 

has been established by all tuna RFMOs. This measure, however, does not 

preclude fishers from catching oceanic whitetip sharks. Practical mitigation 

methods, such as eliminating shallow hooks (above 100 m) on longlines, require 

particular attention. The removal of shallower hooks has already shown promising 

results in reducing catch rates of several epipelagic bycatch species [24]. It is 

important to bear in mind, however, that mitigation measures can generate 

impacts on other species and so both their positive and negative impacts must be 

carefully evaluated [25].

Oceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean appear to 

have a certain degree of site fidelity to the area off northeast Brazil around the 

equator, where all of their 	tracks started. Five out of eight sharks have ended their 
tracks relatively close to their starting points, even after traveling several thousand 

kilometers. Three of these sharks also remained within 500 km of the tagging 

locations during most of the tracking period. Although time limitations prevent 

definitive conclusions from being drawn, a recent study conducted in the 

 97 



Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 
 

	

Bahamas (northwestern Atlantic) also reported that OCS returned to the tagging 

area after long migrations [20]. The Bahamian study gathered data from 10 OCS 

with deployment periods up to 245 days. In the year following their study, scuba 

divers also spotted one of the tagged sharks near the tagging location [20]. The 

authors considered this returning behavior to fall under the definition of 

philopatry, which is the tendency of an organism to return or remain near a 

particular site [26]. The findings presented here further support this theory. 

 

Another interesting observation is that oceanic whitetips from both studies 

(Northwestern and Southwestern Atlantic) did not mix. More data is certainly 

required before a conclusion can be reached, but this result could be an 

indication that northern and southern populations might well be separated. The 

recently developed “electronic spaghetti tag” could be a useful and cost-effective 

tool to investigate this matter. This new satellite tag does not record any data, but 

simply reports where it pops off, providing fisheries-independent measures of 

dispersal patterns and migration [27]. Fine scale genetic studies using 

microsatellite loci could also shed light on this matter [28]. If these hypotheses 

hold, well-defined populations and philopatric behavior can have substantial 

implications for the conservation of this species and suggest that the oceanic 

whitetip shark could benefit, not only from global management measures, but 

from local measures as well.  

 

The distribution of the effort from the Brazilian longline fleet raises important 

concerns regarding the species’ vulnerability to fisheries, especially given its 

depleted population status [29–31]. The Kernel Density estimates indicate that the 

high utilization areas fall exactly within the area where the fishing pressure is 

considerably higher. The region off northeast Brazil, where OCS seems to have 

some degree of philopatry, is rich in oceanic features such as islands, banks and 

seamounts, mostly belonging to the North Brazil and Fernando de Noronha 

Chains, located between 2° and 4° South and 32° and 40° West [32]. The areas 

 98 



Chapter 5: Vulnerability of oceanic whitetip sharks to pelagic longliners 
 

	

surrounding these features are considered important fishing grounds for tuna and 

tuna-like species, including sharks [23,33]. 

 

Interestingly, when looking at the study area at a finer scale the kernel hot spot for 

the second quarter appears to be slightly outside of the highest fishing pressure 

area (Figure 8B). In this quarter, the high-utilization hot spot of oceanic whitetip 

sharks is located just off northeast Brazil above the Cabo Calcanhar and below the 

equator, while most of the fishing sets at this time of the year were made just 

above the equator. This lack of overlap between the species high-utilization area 

and fisheries highest effort could explain the significantly lower CPUE during the 

second quarter as seen in Figure 6. A much stronger overlap is seen on the first 

quarter, which had a higher average CPUE. Considering the time limitation of the 

study (tagging data concentrated on the first semester) and the few individuals 

tagged, it is interesting to find a spatial correlation between fisheries and tagging 

data. The philopatric behavior combined with the fact that tagging was conducted 

through commercial fishing vessels, might have contributed for this result. 

Tagging oceanic whitetip sharks outside of the major fishing zone would provide 

essential information for validating these findings. In any case, the correlation 

found here highlights the potential that tagging experiments hold for providing 

knowledge for the design of spatio-temporal management measures. 

 

More data are clearly needed to understand the spatial dynamics of oceanic 

whitetip sharks in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic and more tagging 

experiments should be encouraged. Future studies should focus on covering the 

entire year cycle through both long deployment periods and tagging during 

different seasons. Improved fisheries monitoring is also of extreme importance 

and observer programs therefore require expansion. This study also highlights 

how fisheries dependent and independent data sources can complement one 

another.

Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

A b s t r a c t  
Time series of depth records from six oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-up 
satellite archival tags (PAT) were analyzed in detail. The aim was to improve our 
knowledge on the vertical behavior of this specie. Sharks were tagged in the 
Atlantic (5) and Indian oceans (1) between 2011 and 2012. Deployment periods 
varied from 100 to 178 days. The sharks spent most of their time in the mixed 
layer, confirming the status of epipelagic species. However, the analyses revealed 
complex vertical movement patterns, including marked diel changes and 
behavior modes. Generalized Additive Models indicated that vertical movements 
were strongly correlated with variations of the depth of the mixed layer. A 
correlation between vertical movements and sea surface temperature (SST) was 
also observed. When SST was above average oceanic whitetips increased their 
vertical activity disregarding the shrink of the mixed layer. This pattern suggests 
that thermoregulation might occur for the species. 
 

1 .  I n t r o d u c t i o n  
 

The oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a threatened pelagic 

predator from tropical waters ocean wide (Bonfil et al., 2008). The species is a 

common bycatch of open water fisheries targeting tuna (Thunnus spp.), swordfish 

(Xiphias gladius) and other tuna-like species (Beerkircher et al., 2000; Frédou et 

al., 2015; Gallagher et al., 2014; Hall and Roman, 2013; Oliver et al., 2015). The 

oceanic whitetip acquired its threatened status due to the increasing fishing 

pressure throughout its range and due to a lack of knowledge regarding its 

biology and ecology (Baum et al., 2006). Under the precautionary approach, a 

series of management measures, which banned the landing, storing and selling of 

oceanic whitetip sharks, were recently implemented by all Tuna RFMOs (Tolotti et 

al., 2015a). The species is now the only pelagic shark protected in all three 

oceans. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 

Fauna and Flora (CITES) has also included the oceanic whitetip in appendix II, 

meaning its trade must now be closely controlled (CoP16 Prop. 42). 

 

 105 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

The lack of knowledge regarding the biology and ecology of the oceanic whitetip 

shark partly comes from its bycatch nature, which has historically resulted in fewer 

incentives for research and conservation (Barker and Schluessel, 2005). In light of 

the ocean wide declining scenario of the species’ populations and of an increased 

interest for conservation of bycatch species, the scientific community has directed 

significant research efforts to fill these wide knowledge gaps. The recent research 

included reproductive biology (Tambourgi et al., 2013), feeding (Madigan et al., 

2015), fisheries (Rice and Harley, 2012; Tolotti et al., 2013), movement patterns 

and behavior (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015a). 

The latters used satellite archival tags to reveal valuable information concerning 

their horizontal movements, depth preferences and temperature ranges. Most of 

the published information, however, consisted on general summaries and vertical 

movements were not explored in detail.  

 

The aim of this study is to provide information on the vertical movement patterns 

of the oceanic whitetip shark, in order to go beyond the existing knowledge that 

this is an epipelagic species. Do oceanic whitetip sharks exhibit diel vertical 

patterns? Do they display different vertical behavioral modes? Is their vertical 

behavior driven by the environment? Are they strictly restricted to the mixed 

layer? Improving our knowledge on bycatch species is an essential step towards 

an ecosystem-based fisheries management, which focus on the ecosystem as a 

whole rather then on maximizing individual target species (Garcia and Cochrane, 

2005; Pikitch et al., 2004).

Time series of depth records from six oceanic whitetip sharks were analyzed in 

detail. All time series came from pop-up satellite archival tags (PAT) deployed in 

the Atlantic (5) and Indian (1) oceans on 2011 and 2012 (Table 1). Deployment 

periods varied from 100 to 178 days. Summarized results of the 5 tags deployed

Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

in the Atlantic were previously described in Tolotti et al. (2015), as well as the 

tagging protocol. The Atlantic sharks were tagged close to the equator on the 

western side of this ocean. All individuals made extensive movements, but 

remained mostly in the equatorial zone. Only one shark migrated south (Figure 1). 

The shark tagged in the Indian Ocean was caught with hand line during a research 

cruise on the Mozambique Channel. For the tagging procedure, this shark was 

brought on board and placed in a tagging cradle. The tag was attached 

intramuscularly under the first dorsal fin using a stainless steel tether and large 

Wilton anchors. This individual was tagged inside the Mozambique Channel and 

migrated north, following the African coast until Somali (Figure 1).

Pop-up satellite archival tags typically store depth (ambient pressure), water 

temperature and light level readings at 10 seconds intervals. This information is 

then used to produce different data products that are transmitted via satellite after 

the tag detaches from the animal. Transmitted data will depend on tag model and 

user-defined settings. Two models of PAT tags, manufactured by Wildlife 

Computers (Redmond, USA), were used in this study, 5 miniPATs and 1 MK10. 

The miniPATs were programmed to transmit depth time series with a resolution of 

5 minutes. The MK10 do not transmit time series, only an aggregated summary of 

the recorded data, however this tag was physically recovered from Crystal Beach 

(Texas) after drifting at sea for about one year since its pop-up. This allowed the 

download of the complete depth and temperature time series with 10 seconds 

resolution. Although MiniPATs were not programmed to transmit temperature 

time series, other transmitted data products provided information on the 

surrounding environment. These products include a daily analysis of the surface 

mixed layer and sea surface temperature (SST), as well as a summary of 

temperature at depth profiles (PDTs). These data products were also available 

from the recovered MK10.

The periods of the day were classified according to local times of sunrise and 

sunset, following the procedure described in Tolotti et al. (2015) and according to 

the NOAA estimation (http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/sunrise.html). 

Since sharks performed extensive horizontal movements during their monitoring 

periods, local sunrise and sunset times varied within and between individuals. 

These variations, however, were not superior to 50 minutes difference. To 

facilitate graphic representations where data is aggregated, day, night dawn and 

 109 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

	

dusk were marked by their respective minimum and maximum estimated times. 

Daytime and nighttime depths were compared through the non-parametric 

Wilcoxon Test at 95% confidence level. For this analysis, depths corresponding to 

crepuscular hours were excluded. Depth data was also grouped into one-hour 

intervals of mean values to test for uniformity over the 24h cycle. The uniformity 

was tested using circular statistics (Rao’s Spacing Test), also at 95% confidence 

level. 

 

A spectral analysis was carried out with the time series of the recovered tag 

(AOCS3), since it does not have any transmission gaps. The aim was to look for 

periodicity in the vertical behavior and infer on possible temporal patterns. A fast 

Fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm was used through the build-in Stats 

package in R (R Core Team, 2013). The function calculates a smoothed 

periodogram using Daniell windows, which are modified moving average filters. 

The raw periodogram is a wildly fluctuating estimate of the spectrum with high 

variance and this smoothing methodology provides a stable estimate (Bloomfield, 

2004). The spectral analysis is particularly well suited for long-term and high-

resolution time series, including those from archival tagging studies (Shepard et 

al., 2006). 

 

The time series were also visually assessed in order to examine any possible 

vertical patterns that could have been masked when grouping the data. They 

were conducted with the help of a visualization tool that enabled zooming and 

scrolling of the time series. The visualization window was adjusted to fit two days 

at a time. In this analysis, the times of sunrise and sunset did no need to be 

estimated. Instead, the depth readings were paired with the light readings 

transmitted by the tags. The light data is transmitted in the form of two daily light 

curves, representing sunrise and sunset. For the recovered tag the complete time 

series of light readings is available. The paring between light curves and depth 

readings was possible thanks to IGOR Pro, a graphing and analysis software 

developed by WaveMetrics, Inc. The tag’s manufacturer data portal (WC-DAP: 

 110 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

	

Wildlife Data Analysis Program) exports a file that is formatted for use with IGOR 

Pro, which facilitated the visual assessment analysis. This paring also increased the 

precision when looking for diel patterns.

To reconstruct the vertical environment occupied by the oceanic whitetip sharks 

during their monitoring periods the temperature at depth summary data (PDT) 

was used. This data product provides the minimum and maximum temperatures 

at fixed 8m depth intervals every 24h. The average temperatures of each depth 

interval were linearly interpolated to produce continuous daily temperature 

profiles with a 0.5m grid resolution, following the method described in Bauer et 

al. (2015). The interpolated temperature profiles were then plotted using a heat-

color scheme. This method was chosen since it was proved to be a good 

alternative in the absence of temperature time series (Bauer et al., 2015). 

 

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have been used to model habitat 

preferences on a variety of oceanic species, including sharks (Bustamante and 

Bennett, 2013; Damalas and Megalofonou, 2010; Lam et al., 2014; Zagaglia et al., 

2004). In this study, a GAM was applied to model the vertical movement of 

oceanic whitetip sharks based on the environmental data transmitted by the tags. 

The daily standard deviation (SD) was considered to be a proxy of sharks’ vertical 

variability (movement amplitude) and, therefore, chosen as response variable. The 

explanatory variables included geolocation estimates (longitude/latitude), sea 

surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth (MLD) and shark size were 

introduced as smoothing terms (thin plate regression splines). To assess temporal 

effects, “month” was included as factorial variable. Since sharks were tagged in 

two ocean basins (Atlantic and Indian), “ocean” was also included as factorial 

variable. Modeling was conducted using the gam function of the mgcv R-package 

(Wood, 2006), using the Gaussian family. All possible combinations between 

variables and factors were tested, totaling 63 models. Models were also run 

 111 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

	

separately for each individual shark in order to investigate individual variability. In 

this case, “ocean” and “size” were not considered, resulting on 15 possible 

combinations. Model selection was based on the Akaike’s information criterion 

(AIC) and further evaluated with residual analysis.

Diel changes in vertical behavior are visible across the time series of all 

individuals. However, different patterns were also observed within and between 

individuals. The strongest signal was observed during crepuscular hours, 

especially at dawn, when sharks swam at considerably shallower depths (Figure 2) 

and spent more time in the firsts 10 m. Circular statistics, applied to the average 

depth per hour of each individual, revealed a lack of uniformity over a 24h cycle 

for all oceanic whitetip sharks (Rao’s Spacing Test p&gt;0.001). The tests result 

highlights the consistency of this crepuscular pattern, present even when day and 

night differences are not observed. 

 

Regarding day and night differences, Figure 2 also shows a general pattern of 

shallower average depths during daytime as opposed to nighttime, when tagged 

sharks appear to move to deeper waters. This pattern is well marked for sharks 

AOCS4, 5, 7 and IOCS1, which exhibited statistically significant differences 

between occupied depths of light and dark hours (Table 2). For sharks AOCS3 

and 6, the average depths did not evidence differences between day and night 

and statistical differences were not detected either. Another interesting feature 

draws attention on Figure 2. Daytime average depths form a slight U-shape, with 

the tagged sharks being in relative shallow waters at sunrise, gradually moving 

deeper as midday approaches and, finally, returning to shallow waters at dusk.

The U-shape can be observed even when day and night average depths do not 

differ, as is the case of shark AOCS3.

Hourly standard deviation did not show the same marked trend as average depth 

(Figure 2). Overall, SD values did not vary much across the 24h cycle. Contrary to 

this overall trend, sharks IOCS1 and AOCS4 exhibited higher SD values during the 

night than during the day. Considering SD as a proxy for frequent vertical 

variations, these sharks seemed to be much more active during nighttime. Besides 

the marked difference between day and night activity, shark AOCS4 also 

exhibited a sharp SD peak shortly after sunset. Similarly, shark AOCS7 showed a 

sharp peak at around 20h. 

 

The spectral analysis performed on the high resolution time series of AOCS3 

revealed two distinct peaks, one at 12 hours and another at 24h (Figure 3). The 

sharp 12h peak most likely represents the crepuscular pattern described above. 

The sharpness of this peak also indicates a high degree of consistence of this diel 

pattern, meaning that the behavioral shift frequently occurs around the same time 

of the day. The 24h peak indicates that periodical behavioral shifts regarding 

daytime and nighttime depths are also occurring. The broad base of this peak, 

however, implies that there is a high degree of variability as to when these shifts 

occur. This is an interesting result that did not appear when the depth readings 

were aggregated by hour, since Figure 2 showed no differences between day and

The visual assessment of each time series allowed the identification of three main 

types of day/night behavioral patterns. Type I was characterized by a preference 

for shallower waters with some sporadic deep dives during the day, while during 

the night, sharks occupied deeper waters with regular up and down movements. 

Type II behavior features the inverse pattern observed on type I, with deeper 

waters occupied during daytime as opposed to nighttime, and also exhibiting 

regular up and down movements. On type III behavior no clear difference 

between day and night depth preferences was observed. Examples of each 

behavior type can be seen on Figure 4. All individuals exhibited the three 

behavioral patterns along their monitoring time, but the representativeness of 

each type varied largely among sharks (Figure 5). Type II was the least frequent 

 115 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 

	

behavior on all time series and occurred more often on AOCS3, representing 

23.7% of this individual’s time series. Type I behavior dominated the time series of 

sharks AOCS4 (41.0%) and IOCS1 (61.2%), while type III dominated the series of 

AOCS5 (62.8%) and 6 (50.5%). Note that due to gaps in the transmission data, 

some 24-h periods were not observed, and therefore could not be classified in 

one category.

The distribution of these types of behavior along the time did not appear to be 

uniform nor to follow a particular pattern (Figure 6). Shark AOCS3, for instance, 

exhibited the three types of behavior almost in the same proportion (Figure 5) 

and these behaviors were highly intercalated across its time series. Long 

sequences of the same behavior type were rare for this individual, the maximum 

being nine consecutive days of type I (Figure 6). In fact, long sequences of one 

behavior type were only seen when this particular behavior was already 

predominant for the individual, like type I for IOCS1 and type III for AOCS5. For all 

sharks, one isolated day of any behavior type occurred more frequently than any 

sequence. Only one individual, shark AOCS4, seemed to show a clear shift on 

behavior with time (Figure 6). During its first fifty days of monitoring, this shark 

exhibited type I behavior almost exclusively. After this period, shark AOCS4 

started to intercalate type I with the other behavior types. At the same time, the 

amount of gaps present in the first 50 days of the time series weakens the 

representativeness of this constant pattern.

Three sharks (AOCS5, 6 and 7) were tagged on the same day at similar locations 

and the duration of their monitoring period was equivalent. This unique situation 

enabled the incorporation of the spatial aspect into the discussion concerning the 

shifts between behavior types. The proportions between the three behavior types 

were linked across the tracks of these individuals (Figure 7). Considering that 

individuals that are simultaneously at the same location are also experiencing the 

same environment, this analysis evidenced moments where environmental factors 

could be the driver of their behavior. At the beginning of May, for example, sharks 

AOCS5 and 7 are at the same square of latitude and longitude and their 

behavioral pattern is also very similar. Shark AOCS6, on the other hand, is in 

another location exhibiting another behavioral pattern, indicating sharks’ 

surroundings could be their behavioral driver. Shark AOCS6 remained in the 

same area for most of May, its behavior pattern, however, shifted completely 

between the first and second halves of the month. Again, an environmental factor 

could be the driver. However, during the second half of April, sharks AOCS5 and 

7 are at the same location exhibiting completely different behavioral patterns. 

This trend appears again during the second half of May. This would suggest that 

the environment would not be the only driver of these behavioral modes.

While examining the time series it was noted that all individuals mainly stayed 

within the first 150 m, but descended on rare occasions to depths below 150 m. 

Looking closely at these rare events, that accounted for only 0.15% of their 

monitoring periods (Tolotti et al., 2015b), common features were identified. These 

features, denominated spike dives, were characterized by rapid descents to 

depths greater then 150 m, followed by considerably slower ascents. Two 

examples of spike dives are shown of Figure 8. All individuals performed spike 

dives during their monitoring period, with descent rates varying from 0.14 to 1.05 

m.s-1 and ascent rates varying form 0.08 to 0.26 m.s-1 (Table 3). Most of spike 

dives lasted between 30 to 45 min, but dives that spanned for more than one hour 

 120 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

were also registered. With the exception of shark AOCS7, spike dives occurred 

mostly during the day (Figure 9). Besides performing the great majority of its 

spike dives during nighttime, shark AOCS7 also exhibited this behavior much

Daily average depth and standard deviation were plotted on top of water column 

temperature in order to identify possible links between behavior and 

environment. Although some environmental changes could be observed, the 

depth trend was overall stable for all sharks (Figure 10). The SD, in the other hand, 

exhibited some variation. On sharks IOCS1 and AOCS6, for example, higher 

values of SD were observed around June-July and early May, respectively. These 

higher values also corresponded with wider mixed layer, indicating more vertical 

amplitude when their preferred environment was expanded. SST also appears to 

influence sharks behavior. Looking at the figures of individuals AOCS3, 6 and 7 is 

possible to see that these sharks experienced colder waters during periods of 

higher SST. For AOCS3 this pattern mostly occurred between April and May.

Sharks AOCS 6 and 7 experienced cold waters more frequently between end of 

April and early May and between March and April, respectively.

tags. Continuous black line represents average depth, doted black line represents 
standard deviation and doted blue line represents mixed layer depth. 
 

To better understand the relationship between behavioral trends and 

environment several GAMs were applied. The models results were not 

unexpected, reflecting the pattern observed in Figure 10. The best-fitted models 

consistently indicated a significant influence of horizontal position, mixed layer 

depth (MLD) and SST on the daily vertical activity (SD). The multiple-tag model 

suggested an additional effect of shark size and explained 50.1% of the deviance 

(R2=0.48, n=685). This model suggests an increase of vertical activity with the 

increase of the MLD and size. SST seems to follow the same trend, but it was the 

least significant factor on the multi-tag model (Figure 11). The individual models 

 123 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

varied slightly between sharks, with horizontal positions being always significant 

as opposed to MLD and SST (Figure 11). The model of shark IOCS1 had 64.7% of 

the deviance explained (R2=0.63, n=97) and a positive linear effect of MLD was 

observed. Shark AOCS3 model also had a good fit with 68.6% of deviance 

explained (R2=0.63, n=165). Besides the positive relationship with MLD, the 

vertical activity of this individual was also positively correlated with SST. The 

models of AOCS5 and 6 were similar to AOCS3, but shark AOCS6 model had a 

weaker performance, with 40.1% of deviance explained (R2=0.34, n=98) as 

opposed to 68.3% for AOCS5 (R2=0.59, n=99). The model of AOCS4 had only 

horizontal position as a significant factor (dev. explained 51.0%, R2=0.41, n=129). 

Lastly, MLD was not a significant factor for AOCS7. Instead, this model suggested 

a non-linear effect with SST, exhibiting an overall negative trend with a slight 

increase close to 28°C (dev. explained 40.3%, R2=0.30, n=97). 

 

To interpret the environment and movement variations more finely, cumulated 

sums of MLD, SST and SD were plotted for each individual. The cumulated sums 

were subtracted by the mean and re-scaled to highlight periods when values are 

above or below the mean (Figure 12). These plots reflected the models results 

and, in some cases, facilitated their understanding. Shark IOCS1, for instance, 

exhibited a perfect aligned correlation between MLD and vertical activity. When 

MLD is above average, and the species preferred environment expands, the SD is 

also above average. The opposite trend also remains true. It is not surprising that 

the GAM of this individual had MLD as a highly significant factor and a very good 

degree of deviance explained. An interesting case is shark AOCS3. In the 

beginning of its time series this shark exhibited the same trend observed for 

IOCS1. Around May, however, a major shift is seen. Instead of decreasing with 

MLD, vertical activity starts to increase disregarding the shrink of its preferred 

environment. During this moment it is SST that starts to reach values above 

average, hence its addition as a significant factor on the model of AOSC3. This 

same trend is observed for shark AOCS5. The MLD was not a significant factor for 

shark AOCS7 and SST was. Indeed, when looking to the cumulated sums, SD and 

 124

MLD do not follow the same direction, while SST and SD do. These two lines are 

not perfectly aligned, however, which could have reflected on the lower explained 

deviance of this shark’s GAM.

Since AOCS3 is the only shark with temperature time series available, it was 

possible to take a closer look on the particularities of the long-term behavior of 

this individual. This shark experienced very high SST values (&gt;29°C) and, at the 

same time, also experienced cold waters more frequently (Figure 10). 

Additionally, this shark did not decrease its vertical activity despite the shrinking

of the mixed layer, which occurred during the same period as high SST (Figure 

11). In fact, when plotting daily temperature range against daily SST it seems that 

there is a positive correlation: the higher the SST the greater the temperature 

range (Figure 13). The same does not seem to hold for daily depth range, which 

remains stable when SST increases. The temperatures experienced by this shark 

were summed by day as a way to represent daily-accumulated heat across its time 

series. Interestingly, despite the observed variations on temperature and SST, the 

accumulated heat remained rather stable (Figure 14).

Recent studies have shown that the oceanic whitetip shark is an epipelagic 

predator largely confined to the mixed layer (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et 

al., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015b), a result that was also confirmed by this study. Up 

until now, however, detailed information on how this species occupies the 

epipelagic environment was lacking. The present study revealed complex 

movement patterns, including marked diel changes, behavior shifts and 

environmental influence on vertical activity. The combination of several analysis 

tools was key to identify this variety of vertical movement patterns. This work also 

represents the first description of satellite archival data form an oceanic whitetip 

shark in the Indian Ocean. 

 

4 . 1 .  D i e l  p a t t e r n s  

 

Previous research on vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks has not 

reported the occurrence of diel behavior (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013). Conversely, 

diel patterns were observed for all six individuals analyzed in the present study. 

While variability was also noted, diel patterns occurred for at least one moment of 

their monitored time series. The most frequent pattern, classified as type I 

behavior (Figure 4), was characterized by shallower depths during the day and 

deeper vertical expansion during the night, resulting in deeper average depths. 

The exact opposite of this diel pattern was also observed, characterized by 

deeper occupation of the water column during daytime than during nighttime 

(type II behavior). Periods of no distinct diel patterns ware also observed (type III 

behavior). Diel vertical movements are very common on species with vertical 

ranges that exceed that of oceanic whitetips, such as blue sharks (Prionace 

glauca), bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius) 

and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) (Abecassis et al., 2012; Coelho et al., 2015; 

Lam et al., 2014; Musyl et al., 2011, 2003). These species usually occupy deep 

 128 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

waters during the day and remain in the mixed layer during the night and are 

believed to be following the vertical migration of meso-pelagic prey species 

within the deep scattering layer (DSL) (Bernal et al., 2009). 

 

Epipelagic predators, such as oceanic whitetips, have also been reported to 

display diel patterns. Silky sharks (C. falciformis) and mahi-mahis (Coryphaena 

hippurus), for example, exhibited vertical movements similar to the type I 

behavior described above (Filmalter et al., 2015; Merten and Appeldoorn, 2014). 

Although inverse to the general diel migration pattern described for pelagic 

species with wide vertical ranges, type I behavior could also be linked to feeding 

on mesopelagic prey from the DSL. Filmalter et al. (2015) reported that silky 

sharks were more vertically active during the night and at a similar depth to the 

nocturnal range of pelagic species known to track the migration of the DSL. The 

authors hypothesized that these increased vertical oscillations were associated 

with feeding activity. In the present study, indication of an increased vertical 

activity during the night was also found, as some individuals (AOCS4, 7 and 

IOCS1) exhibited higher standard deviation values during this period. Oceanic 

whitetip sharks are known to feed on mesopelagic squids (Backus et al., 1956) 

and a recent study using stable isotopes has estimated a nearly equal importance 

between squids (44%) and larger pelagic teleosts (47%) on its diet (Madigan et 

al., 2015). Deep excursions of oceanic whitetips are rare and could not account for 

such a significant portion of a mesopelagic species in its diet, suggesting that 

type I behavior can indeed be linked to feeding on prey from the DSL during the 

night. 

 

Variability on vertical movement patterns is also often reported for pelagic 

species. Five behavior types have recently been described for blue sharks, a 

species known for its marked diel migration to shallower waters during the night 

(Queiroz et al., 2012). These behaviors ranged from the general known diel 

pattern to its inverse and included patterns where no diel differences were 

apparent, just like what was observed for the oceanic whitetip sharks from this 

 129 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

study (type III behavior). Mako (Lamna nasus) and the plankton feeding basking 

shark (Cetorhinus maximus) have been reported to perform opposite diel patterns 

during their monitoring period too (Pade et al., 2009; Sims et al., 2005). These 

behavior shifts are also believed to be linked with the availability of prey. The 

cited studies were able to observe that changes in the diel pattern occurred when 

sharks changed environments, moving from mixed coastal to well stratified off 

shore waters, for example (Pade et al., 2009; Queiroz et al., 2012), or because 

they were mirroring prey behavior (Sims et al., 2005). For the oceanic whitetip 

sharks tagged in the present work, it was not possible to identify clear temporal or 

spatial patterns in the occurrence of the different behaviors. The types of behavior 

were highly intercalated and showed no consistency across their time series 

(Figures 6 and 7). Oceanic whitetips are opportunistic predators (Backus et al., 

1956; Compagno, 1984) and the great variability seen on their vertical movement 

patterns could very well be linked to prey distribution, as it has been proved for 

other pelagic sharks. To move forward on this matter, however, additional 

research is required, as information on prey distribution in the studied areas is 

lacking. Data on other pelagic sharks tagged in the same areas could also provide 

good insights. 

 

The Fast Fourier Transform analysis of the recovered tag (AOCS3) revealed two 

peaks, indicating periodicity on vertical movements (Figure 3). The peak at 24 

hours confirms the diel behavior and its broad base indicates variability. This 

result is in accordance with what was observed in the previous analysis, as shark 

AOCS3 frequently intercalated the three types of behavior across its time series 

(Figure 6). Other pelagic shark species have also shown peaks corresponding to a 

24h cycle, which are typically interpreted as evidence of diel behavior 

(Brunnschweiler and Sims, 2012; Filmalter et al., 2015; Tyminski et al., 2015). The 

peak at 12h, however, is not reported as often for pelagic species. Usually, a 

spectral peak at 12h is seen on coastal species and they are linked to tidal cycles 

(Urmy et al., 2012). Similar to shark AOCS3, the strongest spectral peak in the 

periodogram of a basking shark had a period of 12.35h (Shepard et al., 2006). 

 130 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

The authors found that the peak also matched the tidal cycle, since the shark 

remained in the continental shelf for the duration of its monitoring. Shark AOCS3, 

on the other hand, remained at oceanic waters (Figure 1). Thus, it is unlikely that 

the 12h spectral peak observed for this oceanic whitetip shark has any link to the 

tidal cycle. Instead, the 12h peak could be related to the crepuscular pattern. 

Oceanic whitetip sharks occupied considerable shallower depths during 

crepuscular hours (Figure 2). Coincidentally, at equatorial latitudes day and night 

have similar lengths, resulting in a crepuscular event every 12h (World of Earth 

Science, 2003). Shark AOCS3 stayed at equatorial latitudes for the totality of its 

track, indicating that 12h spectral peak of vertical movement matches the 

crepuscular cycle. The crepuscular pattern of vertical movements was consistent 

throughout the time series of all six individuals, and was also identified for oceanic 

whitetips tagged in the Pacific Ocean (Musyl et al., 2011). The sharpness of the 

12h peak suggests that this crepuscular pattern is a major part of oceanic whitetip 

behavioral repertoire. Southern bluefin tunas (T. maccoyii) exhibited increased 

activity during crepuscular hours, including pronounced ascents to the surface at 

civil twilight (Willis et al., 2009). The authors hypothesized that this behavior had 

orientation purposes because twilight is the best-suited moment for the detection 

of celestial polarization patterns, and also because birds and marine mammals are 

known to use this patterns as navigational cues. This orientation hypothesis could 

explain the crepuscular behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks, especially 

considering that they spent considerably more time at the firsts 10 m of the water 

column during crepuscular hours. It is important to note, however, that studies 

about the sensitivity of oceanic whitetips to polarized light have never been 

conducted. 

 

4 . 2 .  S p i k e  d i v e s  

 

Oceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the North Atlantic (Bahamas) were reported to 

perform sporadic deep dives to the mesopelagic zone, down to 1082m (Howey-

Jordan et al., 2013). Similar to the deep dives observed in the present work, dives 

 131 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

of oceanic whitetips from the Bahamas study had descent rates significantly faster 

than ascent rates, forming a v-shaped profile. However, unlike most sharks of the 

present study, Bahamian sharks performed deep dives mostly at night. The 

difference between the period of when oceanic whitetips performed deep dives 

could simply be due to area particularities, however one of the South Atlantic 

sharks also performed spike dives mostly during the night (shark AOCS7). These 

contrasting periods and the rarity of these deep events make it difficult to 

understand what is driving them. In any case, similar shaped deep dives are 

relatively common among pelagic sharks and are often believed to be associated 

with prey searching behavior (Hoffmayer et al., 2013; Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; 

Sepulveda et al., 2004; Tyminski et al., 2015). Gleiss et al. (2011) suggested that v-

shaped dives might help sharks to efficiently scan the water column for food 

patches while expending minimal energy. They also suggested that slower ascent 

rates might improve the chances of pelagic predators to detect prey because 

backlighting is improved during ascents. 

 

If prey searching is the driver behind the occasional spike dives observed for 

oceanic whitetip sharks, they could have been triggered after sharks remained in 

less productive surface waters for prolonged periods. It has been hypothesized 

that deep dives observed on whale sharks in the Indian Ocean were triggered 

when individuals were crossing less productive areas (Brunnschweiler and Sims, 

2012). Another possible hypothesis for the occurrence of spike dives is the search 

for navigational cues through magnetic gradients (Willis et al., 2009). Sea floor 

magnetic anomalies associated with bathymetric features form a predictable 

gridded pattern believed to aid navigation (Walker et al., 2002). Sharks can detect 

magnetic fields (Kalmijn, 1982) and deep dives might be a mechanism to acquire 

these magnetic cues (Gleiss et al., 2011; Tyminski et al., 2015). The two proposed 

hypotheses behind deep dives are plausible and not mutually exclusive. 

Therefore, it is possible that the isolated spike dives performed by oceanic 

whitetip sharks can be triggered by both foraging and navigational purposes 

depending on the circumstances. 

 132

Water temperature is a limiting factor for species whose body temperature is 

dependent on the external environment, as it represents a central factor 

controlling their physiological processes (Sims, 2003). For a species like the 

oceanic whitetip shark, which occupies the tropical epipelagic niche (Howey-

Jordan et al., 2013; Musyl et al., 2011; Tolotti et al., 2015b), variations of the warm 

mixed layer are expected to play a major role on the species vertical movements. 

The present research confirmed this strong relationship by modeling the daily 

standard deviation of depth readings as proxy of vertical movement amplitude. 

The GAMs showed that tagged oceanic whitetips tended to be more widely 

dispersed in the water column as the depth of the mixed layer increased and, 

consequently, their preferred habitat expanded. This same relationship was 

recently observed for another tropical epipelagic species. Mahi-mahis tagged in 

the Pacific Ocean extended their vertical depth ranges as the thermocline depth 

increased (Furukawa et al., 2014). Only one shark (AOCS7) displayed a different 

behavior. Although tagged with other two sharks and remaining in similar areas, 

shark AOS7 vertical movements did not follow MLD variations. This shark was also 

the only individual to perform spike dives mostly at night. Given the small sample 

size of the present work, it is interesting to see such remarkable differences in 

behavioral patterns. 

 

Besides mixed layer depth, other factors were found to influence the vertical 

movements of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks. The combined GAM indicated an 

effect of individual size, where larger individuals tended to have wider utilization 

of the water column. Figure 2, displaying average depth per hour, also suggests 

that vertical distribution might vary with shark size. This effect is likely a reflex of 

the increased thermal inertia that results from larger body mass, enabling larger 

individuals to expand their thermal habitat (Neill et al., 1976, 1974; Wilson et al., 

2006). A possible effect of size on the vertical movements of oceanic whitetips 

and silky sharks has also been reported on a tagging study conducted off Hawaii 

 133

(Musyl et al., 2011). Large individuals (&gt;200 m) of these two closely related 

species were separated form the juveniles in a cluster analysis based on their 

vertical movements. 

 

Oceanic whitetip sharks tagged in the Bahamas exhibited a correlation between 

average daily depth and sea surface temperature (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013). 

The authors observed that when individuals experienced warmer SST, average 

daily depth increased. For the oceanic whitetips from the present study, most 

GAMs also indicated a positive relationship between vertical movement and SST. 

Interestingly, for two individuals (AOCS3 and 5), this relationship occurred at the 

same time when the relationship between mixed layer depth and vertical 

movement was inverted. In short, when SST was above average these two sharks 

increased their vertical activity disregarding the shrink of the mixed layer. This 

pattern might indicate behavioral thermoregulation. The oceanic whitetips could 

be either using the warmer SST to accumulate heat and explore cooler deep 

waters or diving below the thermocline to cool down. Howey-Jordan et al. (2013) 

also suggested that the correlation between SST and average depth observed for 

the Bahamian oceanic whitetips could be evidence for thermoregulation. In fact, 

the use or active avoidance of heat sources to regulate body temperature has 

been reported for other shark species (Campana et al., 2011; Speed et al., 2012; 

Vianna et al., 2013). There is evidence supporting that behavioral 

thermoregulation optimizes physiological and metabolic processes (Sims, 2003). 

For the oceanic whitetip shark where high-resolution temperature data was 

available, a significant relationship between the daily temperature range and SST 

was observed. When SST increased the temperature range increased too. A 

similar relationship was reported for blue sharks (Campana et al., 2011). The 

authors also reported an increase in maximum depth with SST. In contrast, shark 

AOCS3 depth range did not vary significantly with SST (Figure 13). Campana et al. 

(2011) hypothesized that blue sharks exhibited behavioral thermoregulation to 

reduce metabolic losses and increase foraging efficiency. The reduced sample 

size of the present work prevents further discussion concerning behavioral 

 134 



Chapter 6: Vertical movements of oceanic whitetip sharks 
 

	

thermoregulation on oceanic whitetip sharks. Still, even with the clear need for 

more data, results indicate that the accumulation of heat plays an important role 

on the species vertical movement. It seems that the warmer SST allows oceanic 

whitetips to tolerate greater temperature gradients without limiting their vertical 

movements. 

 

Longline is the main gear responsible for the fishing impacts on oceanic whitetip 

shark populations (Rice and Harley, 2012). Given that this fishing gear 

considerably overlaps with the vertical behavior of the species (Tolotti et al., 

2015b), it is important to continue our efforts to better understand its behavioral 

patterns and the drivers behind these patterns. When dealing with rare 

threatened animals, such as the oceanic whitetip shark, sample size is constrained 

by opportunity. This study was based on only 6 individuals, but the total of 538 

days of observations in the Atlantic Ocean and 100 days of observations in the 

Indian Ocean already provided new information on the species. Nevertheless, the 

scientific community should direct its efforts to increase the number of tagged 

individuals, including different areas. Electronic tags are resourceful non-lethal 

instruments that can significantly improve our knowledge on the ecology of this 

threatened species and, consequently, aid its conservation.

Chapter 7: Final remarks 

1 .  M a i n  f i n d i n g s  
 

Management of pelagic sharks is a complex issue. Their mortality is primarily due 

to incidental catches from tuna fisheries worldwide, but, despite incidental, catch 

rates are high. The shared habitat between pelagic sharks and target species is 

the primary cause of their incidental captures, but they are also considered a 

welcome bycatch. Shark fins are a luxury commodity in the Asian cuisine and their 

trade is very profitable (Clarke, 2007). The legislation set out by tuna RFMOs only 

prevents retention, and not actual capture. Given this scenario, banning measures 

will have little impact on fisher-behavior and the high-level of pelagic shark 

mortality is likely to continue. A set of integrated measures will more effectively 

aid in the conservation and recovery of threatened pelagic sharks. These 

measures should mainly include: (1) the development of alternative fishing 

techniques; and (2) the reduction of fishing effort, e.g. developing spatial or 

temporal management measures such as closed areas/seasons. Monitoring is also 

vital for any successful management system and the implementation and/or 

expansion of observer programs must be encouraged (Chapter 2). 

 

Analysis of observer data from the Brazilian longline fleet reveled that the oceanic 

whitetip shark is frequently captured by this fishery (Chapter 3). The data also 

reveled that oceanic whitetip catches are mainly constituted of individuals under 

the size at first maturity. It was not possible, however, to establish a population 

trend because the observer program only dates back to 2004 and OCS catches 

were not reported on the fishery’s logbooks. In addition to the short time series, 

the lack of a homogeneous distribution of fishing effort and strategy also 

hampered the utilization of CPUE as a proxy of actual abundance. It was observed 

that the catchability of the species varied greatly with gear configuration (fishing 

strategy). CPUE values were significantly higher for vessels using shallow longline 

configuration than those deploying hooks at greater depths. This result was later 

linked with the vertical distribution of the species. 

 145 



Chapter 7: Final remarks 

Observer data from the French purse seine fishery in the Atlantic Ocean was also 

analyzed in an attempt to establish a population trend for the oceanic whitetip 

shark (Chapter 4). The population status of the species in the south Atlantic, 

however, remained unclear. While in the western Atlantic the analyzed time series 

was too short (Chapter 3), in the eastern Atlantic the occurrence index derived 

from the purse seine fishery was very low and did not exhibited any trend 

(Chapter 4). For the western Indian Ocean, besides the observer data from the 

French purse seine fleet, a historical dataset from the Soviet Union was also 

available. The analysis suggested that OCS population have declined since mid 

1990’s in this ocean (Chapter 4). 

 

The combined analysis between tagging and fishery data from the equatorial 

Atlantic (Brazilian longline fleet) provided good insights towards the development 

of mitigation measures (Chapter 5). The results of this study indicate that oceanic 

whitetip sharks spent 95% of their time above 120 m depth. This result perfectly 

illustrates the variations on CPUE values described in Chapter 3, as the depth 

range of the longline with shallow configuration corresponds exactly to the 

species vertical distribution. Despite spending most of the time inside of the 

mixed layer oceanic whitetip sharks exhibited complex vertical movement 

patterns, including distinct diel behavioral patterns and deep diving (Chapter 6). 

Oceanic whitetip vertical movements were also influenced by the sea surface 

temperature, which suggests the occurrence of thermoregulation for the species 

(Chapter 6). 

 

The evidence regarding oceanic whitetip shark vertical distribution is solid and 

corroborated by other recently published works (Howey-Jordan et al., 2013; 

Musyl et al., 2011). This information suggests that the removal of the shallow 

hooks from the longline gear could be proposed as technique to mitigate OCS 

bycatch (Beverly et al., 2009; Walsh et al., 2009). The fact that CPUE variations 

were already observed suggests that this might be an effective measure. The 

movement data also reveled that oceanic whitetips have some degree of

philopatry to the main fishing ground of the Brazilian longline fleet (Chapter 5). 

The horizontal and vertical overlap between oceanic whitetip sharks and the 

Brazilian longline fleet raises concerns regarding the vulnerability of the species. 

Furthermore, fine-scale data collection for this fishery has ceased in 2012 with the 

suspension of its observer program. This current situation will certainly jeopardize 

future analysis of OCS population trends.

This thesis provides new information on the ecology of the oceanic shark ad raises 

important conservation issues. But, as with many poorly studied species, 

knowledge gaps still remain and new questions have emerged. In light of what 

was presented a few research initiatives are suggested. 

 

Due to the clustering of tagged oceanic whitetip sharks on the equatorial Atlantic 

Ocean and on the first half of the year, more tagging is encouraged. It would be 

particularly interesting to tag sharks	 outside the main fishing ground of the 
Brazilian longline fleet. This would provide new information to fuel the discussion 

regarding the philopatric behavior observed for the species and maybe evidence 

of other hotspots in the Atlantic. Movement patterns of oceanic whitetip sharks in 

the Indian Ocean remain unknown, thus tagging efforts should also be directed to 

this ocean. 

 

There is a general consensus amongst fisheries scientists that oceanic whitetip 

populations are declining at dangerous rates, if not already overfished (Baum et 

al., 2006; Rice and Harley, 2012). The lack of fisheries data, however, prevents a 

clear understanding of the situation. Historical reference points are limited and 

systematic monitoring is still scarce. So far, estimations of oceanic whitetip 

population trends have relied on longline fishery data, since the species is more 

frequently caught on this gear. The issue with this fishery’s database is that 

 147

catchability is highly sensitive to variations on the gear, making standardization a 

challenge (Burgess et al., 2005; Ward and Myers, 2005; Ward, 2008). For species 

with a high proportion of zero catches results are often inconclusive, which was 

the case with the analysis presented in Chapter 3. In the purse seine fishery 

catchability is not as sensitive, as modifications of this gear are mostly related with 

decreasing searching time for tuna schools. The analysis of observer data from the 

French purse seine fleet combined with historical data from the Soviet Union 

indicated that purse seine fishery databases could provide reliable abundance 

trends (Chapter 4). Using a simple occurrence index, many data sources, 

especially historic ones, could be integrated for a more robust analysis. 

 

A global assessment, including as many historical data as possible, should be 

conducted for the oceanic whitetip shark, but there are two main issues that need 

to be considered. The associative behavior of oceanic whitetip sharks around 

floating objects is key for the development of abundance indexes derived from 

the tuna purse seine databases. Therefore, studies on this front also need to be 

conducted (see Filmalter et al., 2015). Another issue is how FAD densities have 

evolved along the years. It is still unclear by how much FAD densities have 

augmented and modified the oceanic habitat, and also on how this could have 

affected species behavior (Dagorn et al., 2013a, 2013b; Maufroy et al., 2015). In 

order to estimate reliable abundance trends based on purse seine fishery data the 

FAD issue needs to be addressed as well.
