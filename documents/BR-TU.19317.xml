  As formigas do gênero Mycetophylax pertencem à tribo Attini e são 

restritas a ecossistemas de dunas da costa do oceano Atlântico. Estas 

formigas são um grupo taxonômico interessante para o estudo dos efeitos das 

mudanças climáticas e geológicas do passado sobre a evolução dos habitats 

abertos costeiros da Mata Atlântica, conhecidos como restinga. Assim, o 

principal objetivo deste trabalho foi conduzir um estudo sobre a evolução do 

gênero Mycetophylax por meio de diferentes abordagens, a fim de fornecer 

informações sobre a diversificação e evolução destes organismos em ambientes 

abertos de dunas. Para atingir nossos objetivos conduzimos estudos de 

filogenia molecular, citogenética, e genética de populações, em um contexto 

evolutivo. As espécies foram caracterizadas citogeneticamente e seus 

cromossomos foram submetidos às técnicas de bandamento C e coloração por 

fluorocromos. A integração desses dados a uma hipótese filogenética permitiu 

a inferida de uma hipótese de evolução cromossômica para o gênero 

Mycetophylax. A análise filogeográfica de M. simplex permitiu testar o impacto 

das mudanças paleoambientais sobre a história das populações da costa 

brasileira sul e sudeste do Atlântico. Além disso, avaliamos como os eventos 

de regressão e transgressão marinha influenciou a estrutura demográfica 

desta espécie ao longo de sua área de distribuição. A hipótese filogenética 

inferida a partir dos genes nucleares wingless e long wave rhodopsin sugerem 

que o gênero Mycetophylax, em sua atual designação, é monofilético. As 

espécies M. simplex e M. conformis agruparam em um ramo que é grupo irmão 

de M. morschi e todas as espécies formam um grupo monofilético com alto 

suporte estatístico. M. morschi apresentou dois cariótipos, com colônias 2n=26 

e 2n=30. M. conformis e M. simplex apresentaram o número diploide de 

cromossomos igual a 30 e 36, respectivamente. Observou-se que os resultados 

dos padrões de bandamento cromossômico concordam com a hipótese de 

filogenia molecular inferida para o gênero.  O cariótipo ancestral estimado por 

meio da abordagem filogenética bayesiana foi n=17. Este resultado sugere que 

eventos de fusão cromossômica estiveram envolvidos na redução dos 



                  

xiii 
 

cariótipos de M. morschi e M. conformis e fissão cromossômica em M. simplex. 

A genealogia do gene mitocondrial citocromo oxidase I (COI) de M. simplex 

sugeriu uma baixa estrutura filogeográfica. Os haplótipos estiveram 

distribuídos em toda a sua área de distribuição ao longo da costa do Atlântico. 

Não foram identificadas barreiras evidentes ao fluxo gênico entre as 

populações de M. simplex e elas parecem ter experimentado um longo período 

de estabilidade demográfica até expansões populacionais recentes. Estas 

expansões foram coincidentes com os níveis mais baixos do oceano durante o 

Quaternário. Esses resultados oferecem evidências adicionais convincentes de 

que os habitats abertos da costa do Atlântico Sul foram ambientes dinâmicos 

que influenciaram a diversificação e distribuição das espécies.

Abstract 
 

CARDOSO, Danon Clemes, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, July of the 
2013. Evolutionary history of species of the genus Mycetophylax Emery, 
1913 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae): ants endemic of restinga.  Advisor: 
Mara Garcia Tavares. Co-advisors: José Henrique Schoereder and Tânia Maria 
Feranandes-Salomão. 
 

  The ants of the genus Mycetophylax belongs to the tribe Attini and are 

endemic to sand dune coastal environments of Atlantic Ocean. These ants are 

an ideal group to examine the impact of geological and climatic changes over 

the past on the evolution of open habitats associated with Atlantic Forest, 

known as restinga. The main aim of this thesis is to evaluate the evolution of 

the genus Mycetophylax by means of different approaches in order to provide 

insights about the diversification of these ants on the harsh environment of 

coastal sand dunes. In order to achieve our objectives, the three species of the 

genus were studied using molecular phylogenetics, cytogenetics and 

populations genetics, under an evolutionary context. The three species were 

cytogenetically characterized and the chromosomes were submitted to banding 

techniques (C-banding and Fluorochrome staining). Using an integrative 

approach we inferred a chromosome evolution hypothesis for the genus 

Mycetophylax. A phylogeographic stud was carried out with the species M. 

simplex to test the relative impact of palaeoenvironmental changes on the 

population history of south and southeast Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Besides, 

we tested how the marine regression and introgression had facilitated the gene 

flow from south to northern distribution of this ant. M. simplex and M. 

conformis appear as a sister group of M. morschi and the genus are 

monophyletic, as suggested by published morphological analysis. M. morschi 

showed a polymorphic number of chromosomes, with colonies showing 2n=26 

and colonies 2=30 chromosomes. M. conformis presented a diploid 

chromosome number of 30 chromosomes, while M. simplex showed 36 

chromosomes. The banding patterns were agreement with the molecular 

phylogenetic hypothesis inferred based on nuclear protein-coding genes. The 

ancestral haploid chromosome number inferred by Bayesian phylogenetic 

approach of Mycetophylax genus was 17. These results also claimed that 

fusions were responsible for the evolutionary reduction in chromosome 

numbers of M. conformis and M. morschi karyotypes and a fission 

rearrangement towards M. simplex karyotype. 



                  

xv 
 

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene genealogy of M. simplex suggested a 

shallow phylogeographic structure with haplotypes distributed throughout 

their distribution range along the Atlantic Coast. There was no evident genetic 

break between populations and they seem to have experienced a long period of 

demographic stability until population expansions that were coincident with 

the lowest level of the sea during the quaternary. Our findings offer compelling 

evidences that the coastal open habitats of South Atlantic were an 

evolutionary dynamic environment underpinning species diversity and 

distribution.

Introdução Geral 
 

A biologia evolutiva e a biogeografia buscam entender a diversificação e 

distribuição espaço-temporal da biodiversidade. Ambas foram 

tradicionalmente baseadas nas variações morfológicas observáveis entre os 

organismos. Esta abordagem muito provavelmente nos levou por muito tempo 

a subestimar os níveis reais de diversidade. O advento da biologia molecular 

trouxe a oportunidade de explorar a diversidade biológica por outra 

perspectiva, ao nível de moléculas. Hoje, podemos mensurar a diversidade 

mesmo dentro de espécies, podemos quantificar a diversidade, rastrear o 

movimento dos organismos inferindo eventos de migração e emigração, bem 

como reconstruir padrões históricos de dispersão e demografia (Freeland et al., 

2011). A diversidade genética pode ser avaliada em um contexto evolutivo por 

meio do estudo das relações filogenéticas das linhagens genealógicas e sua 

relação com a distribuição geográfica. Este é o principal objetivo da 

filogeografia, que une elementos da genética de populações e filogenia 

molecular sob um contexto histórico e espacial (Avise, 2000), possibilitando 

assim a formulação de hipóteses biogeográficas.   

  Uma das questões centrais da filogeografia na região Neotropical é qual 

a importância das oscilações climáticas e eventos geológicos do passado em 

moldar sua atual biodiversidade (Hewitt, 2004). Atualmente estão 

compreendidos no Neotrópico os sete hotspots mais diversos do mundo. 

Embora haja um crescente número de estudos, nosso conhecimento acerca 

desta imensa diversidade é escasso. Alguns mecanismos de diversificação das 

espécies têm sido propostos e ressaltam a importância das oscilações 

climáticas no Quaternário que levaram a divergência das espécies por 

alopatria e parapatria (Carnaval et al., 2009). Estes eventos de diversificação 

estão principalmente apoiados na hipótese dos refúgios Pleistocênicos. Os 

refúgios eram fragmentos florestais que se mantinham em regiões onde a 

umidade era preservada e neles as espécies persistiam durante os períodos de 

climas secos e frios. Estas condições ocorriam nos períodos glaciais, 

apontados como uma consequência de variações na órbita terrestre ao redor 

do Sol, conhecida como teoria de Croll-Milankovitch (revisado em Hewitt, 

2000). No entanto, recentemente a hipótese de refúgios pleistocênicos tem sido 

questionada por não explicar todos os padrões de diversidade encontrados no 

Neotrópico (Fitzpatrick et al., 2009; Thomé et al., 2010; Tonini et al., 2013).

A despeito da utilidade dos estudos de filogeografia para o entendimento 

e conservação da biodiversidade, e das formigas como componente ecológico 

importante da fauna dos diversos ecossistemas, poucos estudos filogeográficos 

têm sido conduzidos na América do Sul e no Brasil com estes organismos 

(Ahrens et al., 2005; Solomon et al., 2008; Resende et al., 2010).  

Na região neotropical destaca-se o grupo de formigas da tribo Attini, que 

ao longo de sua evolução, estabeleceu a agricultura por meio do cultivo de 

fungos Basidiomicetos há mais de 50 milhões de anos atrás (Schultz &amp;amp; Brady, 

2008). É notável a evolução de tal comportamento, visto que este é conhecido 

apenas para três grupos de animais, incluindo o homem (Mueller et al., 2005). 

As formigas cultivadoras de fungo, como são conhecidas, dependem 

obrigatoriamente da manutenção do fungo simbionte para alimentação da 

colônia (Weber, 1972). A cultura do fungo pode depender da utilização de 

vários recursos e baseado no comportamento de forrageamento das formigas, 

a maioria dos Attini pode ser incluída em duas guildas tróficas básicas. As 

formigas cortadeiras herbívoras dos gêneros Atta e Acromyrmex, que cultivam 

seu fungo simbionte utilizando grandes quantidades de material vegetal fresco 

cortado, e as não cortadeiras, que mantêm seus jardins de fungos utilizando 

detritos vegetais, fezes e animais em decomposição (Weber, 1972).  

Baseado em caracteres morfológicos únicos e suportados por dados 

moleculares (Schultz &amp;amp; Brady, 2008), as espécies de Attini podem ainda ser 

separadas em dois clados monofiléticos denominados Paleoattini e Neoattini, 

inicialmente identificadas por Kusnezov, (1963). O primeiro incluem as 

espécies basalmente divergentes Mycocepurus, Myrmicocrypta e Apterostigma, 

enquanto, o último inclui todas as outras linhagens Kalathomyrmex, 

Mycetarotes, Mycetosoritis, Mycetophylax, Cyphomyrmex, Mycetagroicus, 

Sericomyrmex, Trachymyrmex, Acromyrmex e Atta (Schultz &amp;amp; Brady, 2008).  

  Apesar de importância ecológica e científica para o estudo da evolução 

da cultura do fungo, o gênero Mycetophylax é um dos menos estudados 

(Klingenberg &amp;amp; Brandão, 2009). Segundo Kempf (1972), Mycetophylax 

consistiria de 15 espécies encontradas somente em zonas áridas. No entanto, 

recentemente Klingenberg &amp;amp; Brandão (2009) realizaram a revisão taxonômico 

do grupo, e concluíram com base em caracteres morfológicos, que o gênero é 

composto por apenas três espécies: M. conformis, M. simplex e M. morschi. 

Ainda segundo estes autores, o gênero Mycetophylax ocorre apenas em 

ecossistema de restinga, ao longo da costa do Atlântico Sul.

A espécie M. conformis ocorre desde o caribe até o estado de São Paulo. 

Enquanto a espécie M. simplex, por sua vez, ocorre nos estados do Rio Grande 

do Sul e Santa Catarina (Klingenberg et al., 2007; Cardoso et al. 2010). Por 

outro lado, Albuquerque et al. (2005), constataram que Weber (1982) indicava 

o estado de São Paulo como o limite de ocorrência do gênero Mycetophylax. 

Apesar disso, Kempf (1972) em seu catálogo de formigas da região Neotropical 

já havia registrado M. simplex no estado do Rio Grande do Sul. Isto indica que 

os dados sobre sua distribuição são controversos e requerem maiores estudos 

para completa compreensão. As espécies M. simplex e M. conformis parecem 

não sobreporem suas áreas de ocorrência, entretanto, ocorrem 

simpatricamente com M. morschi. A espécie M. morschi, previamente incluída 

no gênero Cyphomyrmex, é encontrada nas restingas desde o estado do Rio de 

Janeiro até o Rio Grande do Sul (Klingenberg &amp;amp; Brandão, 2009).   

Por serem organismos adaptados a ambientes abertos e restritos a região 

de dunas em restinga, as espécies do gênero Mycetophylax são uma excelente 

oportunidade para a avaliação de hipóteses filogeográficas alternativas de 

diversificação e distribuição das espécies na região Neotropical. De fato, os 

estudos filogeográficos têm sido conduzidos com espécies associadas e 

restritas a ambientes úmidos de floresta. A análise limitada a estas espécies 

não permite uma completa apreciação dos processos condicionantes da 

biodiversidade de um bioma tão heterogêneo quanto a Mata Atlântica.  

Adicionalmente, estudos citogenéticos e sobre o tamanho de genoma tem 

sido ferramentas úteis no estudo da diversidade de espécies e contribuído 

significativamente, para o entendimento da história evolutiva de vários grupos 

de organismos (Soldán &amp;amp; Putz, 2000; Pellegrino et al., 2005; Schubert, 2007). 

O tamanho do genoma dentro de uma espécie tende a ser constante, assim 

como certas características dos cromossomos, como número, tamanho, forma 

e composição de DNA. Assim, como todas essas características estão sujeitas a 

mudanças evolutivas e relacionadas com a especiação (King, 1993), tem sido 

empregadas no estudo das relações filogenéticas das espécies.  

Diversos estudos citogenéticos foram realizados em Formicidae e, de 

modo geral, estes sugerem que as mudanças nos cariótipos acompanharam a 

diversificação das espécies e gêneros em formigas (revisado por Lorite &amp;amp; 

Palomeque, 2010). Modificações cariotípicas causados por fissões 

cromossômicas parecem ter tido um papel maior do que fusões, inversões e 

translocações na evolução do cariótipo de Formicidae (Lorite &amp;amp; Palomeque, 

2010).  



                  

4 
 

Embora poucos estudos tenham avaliado o tamanho de genoma em 

formigas (Tsutsui et al., 2008; Ardila-Garcia et al., 2010), estes mostraram que 

assim  como os cromossomos,  este caractere evoluiu continuamente neste 

grupo de organismos. No entanto, mudanças no tamanho do genoma parecem 

não estar correlacionados com o aumento do número cromossômico (Lorite &amp;amp; 

Palomeque, 2010).  

O principal objetivo da presente tese de doutorado foi estudar a história 

evolutiva e relações filogenéticas do grupo de formigas endêmicas de restinga 

do gênero Mycetophylax. Os resultados e a abordagem multidisciplinar 

utilizada no presente trabalho devem contribuir para um melhor entendimento 

da interação dos diversos fatores que moldaram a evolução e diversificação de 

Attini. Eles também contribuirão para o entendimento do estabelecimento 

destes organismos e da fungicultura em ecossistemas abertos não florestais.  

Para alcançar esse objetivo, a tese está estruturada em três capítulos 

que, embora estejam interconectados, foram escritos como unidades de leitura 

independente. 

 No primeiro capítulo construiu-se uma hipótese filogenética, com 

caracteres moleculares, para Mycetophylax. Esta análise incluiu as três 

espécies do gênero, coletadas em diferentes locais da sua distribuição 

geográfica. Analisando dois genes nucleares, testou-se o status monofilético de 

Mycetophylax, determinado pela avaliação das características morfológicas, e 

reafirmou-se a inclusão da espécie previamente incluída no gênero 

Cyphomyrmex.   

 No segundo capítulo discutiu-se a organização do genoma das três 

espécies do ponto de vista citogenético. Estabeleceu-se o cariótipo das espécies 

e utilizaram-se diferentes técnicas de coloração e bandamento com o objetivo 

de avaliar as relações filogenéticas do gênero Mycetophylax. Utilizou-se uma 

abordagem filogenética para a formulação de uma hipótese de evolução 

cromossômica e dos possíveis eventos históricos envolvidos nas mudanças 

cariotípicas observadas, utilizando-se o relógio molecular.  

 Por último, no capítulo três, acessou-se a estrutura genética 

populacional de Mycetophylax simplex, considerando-se toda sua área de 

distribuição ao longo da costa do Atlântico. O intuito dessa análise era 

verificar o efeito dos fatores históricos em moldar a distribuição atual desta 

espécie. Por meio de sequências de DNA do gene mitocondrial citocromo 

oxidase I (COI) e do gene nuclear ?wingless? avaliou-se se as populações de M.

Abstract 

 

Molecular methods have substantially advanced our knowledge about 

ant systematics in the past few years. Here, we infer the molecular phylogeny 

of sand dune ants of the genus Mycetophylax, Emery 1913 (Formicidae: 

Myrmicinae: Attini) using 730 base pairs of DNA sequences of the two nuclear 

genes longwave rhodopsin and wingless. Our analyses indicate that 

Mycetophylax is monophyletic, as suggested by its morphological characters. 

M. morschi, previously considered a species of Cyphomyrmex due to a scrobe-

like impressed area on the head, forms a well-supported cluster with the two 

other species of Mycetophylax, M. conformis and M. simplex. Our analysis 

yields the first comprehensive phylogeny of Mycetophylax based on molecular 

data and includes specimens from localities within a wide distributional range 

as well as all species belonging to the genus following the recent taxonomic 

revision.

Introduction 

 

Ants are a large and ecologically successful group of insects 

ubiquitously occurring in diverse ecosystems and habitats throughout the 

world. Over 12.500 species are currently known (Agosti and Johnson, 2013), 

all belonging to the monophyletic family Formicidae. Ant taxonomy and 

systematic has advanced in recent years, providing us good clues about 

phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, taxonomic reviews have provided a more 

comprehensive picture of the number of species within genera due to the 

description of new species or new synonyms (Mayhé-Nunes and Brandão, 

2007; Rabeling et al., 2007; Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009; Sosa-Calvo and 

Schultz, 2010). 

Mycetophylax Emery 1913 is a genus of the tribe Attini (Formicidae: 

Myrmicinae), which, like another genera of this tribe, grows Basidiomycota 

fungi and utilizes them as their main food source. Until recently, more than 15 

species and subspecies (plus four synonyms) had been described as members 

of the Mycetophylax genus (Bolton et al., 2006). However, Klingenberg and 

Brandão (2009) synonymized most of these or transferred them to other 



                  

12 
 

genera, so that the only remaining species form a relatively homogenous 

group, characterized by a distinctly smooth mesosoma without spines or only 

rounded protuberances and a subtriangular head without psammophore. 

Considering these criteria, only three species remained in the genus, M. 

morschi (Emery, 1888), M. conformis (Mayr, 1884) (type species) and M. simplex 

(Emery, 1888) (Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009). Based on comparative 

morphological traits, the authors suggested that the Mycetophylax genus is 

monophyletic.  

As previous molecular phylogenetic reconstructions of the Attini did not 

include M. simplex or specimens of the three species from different localities, 

we here use a comprehensive phylogeny of Mycetophylax based on molecular 

data to test the proposed monophyly of the genus.  

 

Material and Methods 

 

Taxon Sampling and DNA Extraction 

 

Samples of 17 colonies of the three species of Mycetophylax were 

collected along the South Atlantic coast, based on their previously published 

distribution area (Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009; Cardoso and Cristiano,

2010; Cardoso et al., 2012). Additionally, we sampled specimens of the 

Apterostigma sp. pilosum complex, Apterostigma steigeri and Sericomyrmex 

parvulus in Viçosa, MG, Brazil, and Mycocepurus goeldii in Araranguá, SC, 

Brazil. Samples of Trachymyrmex fuscus from Rio Claro, SP, Brazil, were 

kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Odair C. Bueno. Additional sequences of other 

Attini genera and out-group were obtained from GenBank. Sample size, 

locations, and accession numbers are listed in Table 1. 

Genomic DNA extraction from one worker per colony was performed 

according to the standard CTAB/chloroform techniques (Sambrook and 

Russell, 2001) or following a modified phenol-chloroform protocol (Fernandes-

Salomão et al., 2005). Nuclear sequences were obtained for the wingless (WG) 

and longwave rhodopsin (LW) genes, using previously published primers (Ward 

and Downie, 2005; Brady et al., 2006). These loci have been successfully 

sequenced in previous phylogenetic studies on ants and particularly the 

wingless locus was shown to be informative at the species- and genus-levels 

(Schultz and Brady, 2008; Mehdiabadi et al., 2012).

DNA Amplification, Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis 

 

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a final volume of 25 

µL (2U of GoTaq® Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega), dNTPs (0.25 mM each), 

MgCl2 (2.5 mM), reaction buffer (1x), a pair of primers (0.48 µM each) and 1 

mL of DNA). The thermocycler conditions during the amplification reaction 

were 2 min denaturation at 94ºC, followed by 35 cycles of 94ºC for 1 min, 

60ºC (for LW) or 55ºC (for WG) for 1 min, and 72ºC for 1 min, with a final 

extension at 72ºC for 7 min. Purified PCR products were sequenced directly 

using the same primers for amplification by Macrogen Inc., South Korea 

(www.macrogen.com). 

The chromatograms were evaluated and edited using the program 

Consed (Gordon et al., 1998). The 17 sequences of LW and WG were separately 

aligned with sequences of five other Attini sequences obtained in this study 

and eleven sequences downloaded from GenBank (Table 1 for accession 

numbers). Next, sequences were concatenated and analyzed by translation 

into amino acids using the program MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al., 2011). The 

intron of the LW gene was excluded from the alignment. 

In order to select the substitution model of DNA evolution that fitted 

best to each gene under Akaike?s Information Criterion (AIC) we used 

Modeltest 3.6 (Posada and Crandall, 1998). Taking into account these 

parameters, a maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed with PAUP 4.0 

(Swofford, 2003), with boot-strapping of 1000 replicates. Bayesian analysis 

was performed with MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) for 

phylogenetic inference after using MrModeltest 2.2 (Nylander 2004) to estimate 

the nucleotide substitution model under AIC. The Bayesian analyses consisted 

of two independent runs of ten million generations each, sampled every 1000 

generations and an appropriate burn-in was determined using Tracer v1.4 

(Rambaut and Drummond, 2007). A total of 25% of the tree was burned out to 

produce a single consensus topology that was visualized using the FigTree 

v1.4 program (Rambaut, 2009). The topologies inferred by both methods were 

tested to check the congruence using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test 

implemented in PAUP 4.0.

Results 

 

Partial sequences were obtained for the LW (384 bp without intron) and 

WG (346 bp) genes, resulting in an alignment of 730 base pairs comprising 19 

sequences from specimens of Mycetophylax (17 obtained in this study plus two 

downloaded from the GenBank), 15 sequences of other Attini ants and one 

out-group. The alignment included 208 variable sites and 150 parsimony 

informative sites. The substitution models selected for LW (HKY + G) and WG 

(GTR + G) were used in the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis. The 

topologies from both phylogenetic methods were statistically equivalent (S-H 

test, p = 0.236).   

Figure 1 shows the Bayesian consensus phylogeny based on the 

concatenated sequences. Our phylogenetic analysis unambiguously supports 

the monophyly of the genus Mycetophylax with higher statistical support as a 

sister group of the genus Cyphomyrmex. M. morschi is clearly nested within 

the genus Mycetophylax, as currently suggested based on morphological traits 

(Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009). This result was also supported when both 

nuclear markers were analyzed separately (data not shown) and by both 

methods of phylogenetic reconstruction.  

Discussion 

 

The purpose of this study was to assess the monophyly of the genus 

Mycetophylax as presently recognized by morphological traits. Our results 

clearly supported the findings based on morphological traits described by 

Klingenberg and Brandão (2009). All species and specimens of the genus 

Mycetophylax from different localities throughout their distributional range fell 

into a well-supported monophyletic clade. This result is in agreement with 

previous molecular phylogenetic hypotheses based on a study with M. morschi 

(denominated Cyphomyrmex) and M. conformis, though only one specimen 

from each species was included in the study (Schultz and Brady, 2008). Our 

molecular phylogenetic reconstruction included six additional specimens of M. 

morschi and five of M. conformis from different localities, and six specimens of 

M. simplex, which was not included in the previous molecular phylogenetic 

analysis (see Wetterer et al., 1998; Schultz and Brady, 2008). M. morschi, of 

which some taxonomists still believe that it should be considered as member 



                  

15 
 

of the genus Cyphomyrmex, was unambiguously placed in the genus 

Mycetophylax. 

We also observed that the inclusion of M. simplex in the analysis 

changed the relationship between M. conformis and M. morschi. In the 

Bayesian consensus phylogeny reconstructed with these three species, M. 

morschi appeared as sister group of a well-supported cluster comprising M. 

simplex and M. conformis (posterior probability (PP) = 0.99). Early during the 

evolutionary time, the genus Mycetophylax seems to have diverged into two 

different lineages. One of these lineages evolved into M. morschi, while the 

other diversified into M. conformis and M. simplex. This relationship is also 

supported by the morphological similarity between M. conformis and M. 

simplex that can be easily distinguished from M. morschi that bears a scrobe-

like depression on head (see Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009).  

The genus Cyphomyrmex is likely the sister group of the genus 

Mycetophylax. Although this cluster does not show statistical support in 

Maximum Likelihood analysis, it is well-supported by Bayesian analysis and is 

in agreement with a previous report (Schultz and Brady, 2008). Moreover, the 

species Kalathomyrmex emeryi, which previously was included in the genus 

Mycetophylax, clearly branches off early in the tree, even with the inclusion of 

M. simplex in the analysis. Considering the morphological distinctiveness of K. 

emeryi due to psammophore setae on the clypeus (Klingenberg and Brandão, 

2009) and its basal position on the tree, we agree that K. emeryi should be 

considered a distinct monotypic genus, as defined in the taxonomic revision 

conducted by Klingenberg and Brandão (2009). The other species removed 

from the genus Mycetophylax was not included in the analysis, however 

Paramycetophylax bruchi also presents some morphological distinctions from 

Mycetophylax (see Klingenberg and Brandão, 2009). Its phylogenetic position 

requires further analysis. 

Mycetophylax seems to be a small genus with marked geographic 

distribution. It is restricted to the sand dune environments of the Atlantic 

coast. M. conformis and M. simplex are parapatric throughout most of their 

range (Cardoso et al., 2012). This pattern suggests that speciation between 

them could have been facilitated by vicariant events. The coast of Brazil is 

known to have been profoundly remodeled during the Quaternary (Dillenburg 

and Hesp, 2009). The sand dune fields along the coast were modified due to 

marine introgressions and regressions, which could have created islands that 

isolated populations and might have promoted speciation. However, M. morschi 



                  

16 
 

is sympatric with the other two species. The high phylogenetic resolution 

(phylogenetic signal) among the Mycetophylax species may reflect that there 

has been sufficient time for the accumulation of shared derived nucleotide 

substitutions among lineages and that supports the observed monophyly.

Abstract 

The genus Mycetophylax Emery, 1913 is a small monogynous basal 

Attini ant (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), endemic to sand dunes along the 

Brazilian coastlines (Restinga). A recent taxonomic revision validates three 

species, Mycetophylax morschi (Emery, 1888), M. conformis (Mayr, 1884) and 

M. simplex (Emery, 1888). In this paper, we cytogenetically characterized all 

species that belongs to the genus and analyzed the karyotypic evolution of 

Mycetophylax in the context of a molecular phylogeny and ancestral character 

state reconstruction. M. morschi showed a polymorphic number of 

chromosomes, with colonies showing 2n=26 and 2n=30 chromosomes. M. 

conformis presented a diploid chromosome number of 30 chromosomes, while 

M. simplex showed 36 chromosomes. The C-banding pattern revealed lower 

heterochromatin content in both cytotypes of M. morschi, which were mainly 

centromeric. Furthermore, M. conformis and M. simplex showed positive blocks 

in pericentromeric and centromeric regions and some completely 

heterochromatic short arms. Sequential staining with DA/DAPI/CMA3 

revealed that heterochromatin in M. conformis and M. simplex is AT+ rich, and 

one pair showed a positive CMA3 band. Our analysis suggest that the 

ancestral haploid chromosome number of Mycetophylax genus was 17 

(Likelihood framework) or 18 (Bayesian framework). The analysis also 

confirmed that fusions were responsible for the evolutionary reduction in 

chromosome numbers of M. conformis and M. morschi karyotypes whereas 

fission determines the M. simplex karyotype. These results obtained show the 

importance of fusions in chromosome changes in Formicidae and how a 

phylogenetic background can be used to reconstruct hypotheses about 

chromosomes evolution.

Introduction 

The Attini tribe belongs to the Myrmicinae subfamily and comprises ants 

that are known to engage in a symbiosis with a Basidiomycota fungus, which 

is their main food source. They are restricted to the New World and are 

primarily distributed in the Neotropics, where they achieve their greatest 

diversity. Currently, the tribe comprises more than 230 described species 

grouped into 14 genera (Schultz &amp;amp; Brady 2008, Klingenberg &amp;amp; Brandão 2009). 

Although some systematic studies on Attini tribe have been conducted, 

information is scarce regarding the majority of the groups and the taxonomy of 

many species still requires revision. Indeed, recent revisionary studies have 

permitted the identification of sibling species (Schultz et al., 2002), description 

of new species (Sosa-Calvo &amp;amp; Schultz, 2010), and even the description of a new 

genus (Klingenberg &amp;amp; Brandão, 2009). 

The genus Mycetophylax is a small monogynous basal Attini that just 

recently has gained more attention (Kligenberg &amp;amp; Brandão, 2009, Cardoso et 

al., 2011, 2012). About 15 species, subspecies and varieties were coded to the 

genus Mycetophylax (Kempf, 1972). Following the taxonomic revision based on 

morphological systematics, the majority of those species were synonymized 

and some others were included into Mycetophylax, originally belonging to the 

Attini genus Cyphomyrmex Mayr, 1862. Currently the genus Mycetophylax is 

composed of three valid species, M. conformis (Mayr, 1884), M. morschi (Emery, 

1888) and M. simplex (Emery, 1888). However, some issues concerning the 

occurrence of sibling species within Mycetophylax and the status of M. morschi 

within the genus are still undefined.  

Chromosomes can display different sizes, shapes and compositions of DNA 

and there is ample evidence that chromosome changes can contribute to 

speciation (King, 1993). All these characteristics make them a reliable criterion 

in evolutionary and taxonomic studies. Karyotype descriptions and 

chromosomal comparative analyses are an important independent tool for 

taxonomy and understanding chromosome evolution, particularly when 

relying on phylogenetic tree (Guerra 2012). The ready availability of DNA 

sequences and advances in molecular phylogenetic analysis have allowed 

researchers to infer the relationships of ants that can be used in an integrative 

cytogenetic approach. Sequences of protein-coding nuclear genes have been 

shown to be useful for resolving phylogenetic relationships within genera and 

between related species in fungus growing ants (Schultz &amp;amp; Brady 2008; 

Mehdiabadi et al., 2012). Analysis of wingless and long-wave rhodopsin gene 



                  

26 
 

sequences led to the recent molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of the 

Mycetophylax genus (Cardoso et al., 2013 - Chapter 1), which was in 

agreement with the morphological features. Recently, the nuclear content of 

the three species were estimated by flow cytometry, data that provided 

noteworthy information at a higher level than the species level (Cardoso, 

2012), but information concerning the Mycetophylax karyotype is no longer 

available. 

Thus, our aim was to provide the first characterization of Mycetophylax 

species karyotype, including chromosome number, morphology, 

heterochromatin location and chromatin AT/GC richness. We discuss the 

evolutionary dynamics of the karyotypes within the genus considering the 

recently published phylogeny. Additionally, lineage-specific rearrangements 

leading to different chromosome numbers in Mycetophylax were tested using 

ancestral character state reconstruction. For this purpose we used two 

recently developed different approaches by Mayrose et al. (2010) based on 

Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods in order to put forward insights 

about chromosome evolution in ants.    

 

Materials and Methods 

Biological material and chromosome preparation 

 

Colonies of the three species were collected from sand dunes 

throughout their occurrence area along the Brazilian Atlantic Coast, from Rio 

Grande do Sul State to Rio de Janeiro State between December 2009 and 

March 2011. The colonies of M. simplex (19 colonies) were collected on beaches 

in the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio de 

Janeiro. M. conformis (21 colonies) were collected on beaches in the States of 

Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, while M. morschi (32 colonies) were collected in 

all the states mentioned. Following collection, the colonies were transported to 

the laboratory and reared following the protocol described by Cardoso et al. 

(2011) until brooding occurred. When available, at least ten individuals from 

each colony were used in cytogenetic analyses. All the ants collected were 

preserved in ethanol and confirmation of species identification was performed 

by Rodrigo Feitosa, at the Museum of Zoology of  the University of São Paulo 

(Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo, MUZSP), where vouchers 

were also deposited.  



                  

27 
 

Metaphase spreads were prepared from the cerebral ganglia of post-

defecant larvae, according to protocol proposed by Imai et al. (1988). The 

cerebral ganglion was dissected in colchicine-hypotonic solution (0.005%) 

under a stereoscopic microscope, transposed to a new drop of same solution 

and incubated under light protection for one hour until slide preparation (see 

Imai et al., 1988 for detailed procedure). The slide with metaphases were 

examined under a phase contrast microscope and stained with 4% Giemsa 

solution in Sorensen?s buffer, pH 6.8, to determine chromosome number and 

morphology. We classified the chromosomes following a modified 

nomenclature based on the proposed by Levan et al. (1964), which is based on 

four types of centromeric position: acrocentric (A), subtelocentric (ST), 

submetacentric (SM) and metacentric (M).  

 

C-banding and Fluorochrome staining 

 

In order to determine the distribution pattern of heterochromatin, the 

BSG (barium hydroxide/saline/Giemsa) banding technique was performed, 

essentially following the method described by Sumner (1972), with 

modifications in the duration of treatment with Ba(OH)2, as proposed by 

Pompolo and Takahashi (1990). Sequential fluorochrome staining with 

chromomycin A3 / distamycin A / 4?-6?-diamindino-2-phenylindole 

(CMA3/DA/DAPI) was conducted according to Schweizer (1980) in order to 

characterize CG and AT richness region on chromosomes. The slides were 

analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX 60) equipped with 

a digital camera system (Q color 3 Olympus®). The fluorescent signals were 

analyzed with different filters: WB filter (450 to 480 nm) for the fluorochrome 

CMA3 and WU filter (330 to 385 nm) for the fluorochrome DAPI. 

 

Chromosome evolution analysis 

 

In order to infer and support the patterns and processes underpinning 

chromosomal evolution in Mycetophylax an integrative cytogenetic and 

molecular phylogeny study was conducted. To determine the direction of 

chromosomal changes (i.e. fusion versus fission) that occurred in the genus 

Mycetophylax, Attini species with known karyotypes were used as an out-

group. Thus, two different methods were performed with the purpose of 

outlining a chromosome evolution hypothesis for this genus. The software 



                  

28 
 

ChromEvol 1.3 (Mayrose et al., 2010) was used to infer the chromosome 

evolution model and haploid ancestral states (chromosome numbers) by 

Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods, relying on previously published 

phylogenetic hypotheses (Appendix 1).  

The molecular phylogenetic tree for Mycetophylax, on which the haploid 

ancestral states were inferred in this work, was based on the wingless and 

long-wave rhodopsin matrix of Cardoso et al. (2013). We reconstruct the 

Bayesian tree from that study using selected taxa that were cytogenetically 

characterized or that have their karyotype known, using the same settings 

parameters and substitution model to run MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist &amp;amp; 

Huelsenbeck, 2003). ChromEvol 1.3 was carried out relied on this 

reconstructed tree, and evaluates eight mechanisms of chromosome evolution 

hypotheses, taking into account: dysploidy, the increase or decrease in 

chromosomes; duplications, whole-genome duplication; and demi-duplication, 

a mechanism that facilitates the transition from an n chromosome to 1.5 n. 

The last feature was not evaluated in our analysis, since it is only widespread 

and common in plants. All the parameters were adjusted to the data following 

the recommendation of Mayrose et al. (2010). The models and their null 

hypotheses were analyzed with 10,000 simulations and the one that best fit 

the data set was selected under the Akaike information criterion (AIC). 

Subsequently, to define a more complete chromosome evolution 

hypothesis, the node ages of Mycetophylax were estimated. This analysis was 

performed to determine when the possible splits between lineages occurred, to 

assess the information of chromosome changes in a geological and 

evolutionary context. Thus, molecular dating of Mycetophylax lineages were 

estimated using previously reported nuclear clock calibrations for Attini ants 

(Schultz &amp;amp; Brandy, 2008). In a matrix for the genes wingless and long-wave 

rhodopsin downloaded from the NCBI GenBank (see Appendix 1), we included 

sequences of cytogenetically characterized Mycetophylax species. The nuclear 

genes matrix was analyzed under a Bayesian framework and uncorrelated 

lognormal-relaxed clock model in BEAST v. 1.6.1. (Drummond &amp;amp; Rambaut, 

2007) as described by Rabeling et al. (2011).

Results 

 

Karyotype analysis and chromosome banding 

 

The three species of the genus Mycetophylax investigated present 

different chromosome numbers and karyotype morphologies (Fig. 1). M. 

morschi showed populations with two distinct chromosome sets. Populations 

from Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro State presented diploid 

chromosome numbers equal to 2n=30 or 2n=26 (n=13), whereas all the 

populations from Santa Catarina, Paraná and São Paulo State showed 2n=26. 

No hybrids were found. M. morschi presented an almost bimodal karyotype 

that consisted of seven large and six small chromosome pairs for populations 

with 2n=26 chromosomes, and six large and nine small pairs in populations 

with 2n=30 chromosomes (Fig. 1a and b). Both M. morschi karyotypes 

displayed nine metacentric pairs and one acrocentric pair; however M. morschi 

2n=26 showed only three submetacentric pairs, whereas specimens with 

2n=30 showed five. In karyotypes with 2n=26, one strongly and two weakly 

stained regions were observed in the terminal portion of the long arm of 

chromosome 3 and chromosomes 2 and 5, respectively. These regions may 

correspond to secondary constrictions. Similarly, a secondary constriction on

chromosome 3 was observed in the karyotype 2n=30. 

In all of the metaphases analyzed, M. conformis presented 2n= 30 (n=15) 

and a chromosome complement composed of eleven metacentric and four 

submetacentric pairs, morphologically similar and relatively small, except for 

the first metacentric pair, which was larger (Fig. 1c). A secondary constriction 

was observed on the second pair of metacentric chromosomes.  

M. simplex showed the largest chromosome number of the genus, 2n=36 

(n=18). It was composed by ten metacentric and eight submetacentric pairs 

(Fig. 1 d). The first metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes (pairs 1 and 

11) were large and the remainders were from medium to small in size.  

The species showed different patterns of heterochromatin distribution 

(Fig. 2). In M. morschi karyotypes, the heterochromatin is quite evident and 

can be distinguished in a few chromosomes in the centromeric region (Fig. 2a 

and b). M. conformis and M simplex showed conspicuous heterochromatin 

blocks in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of most chromosomes, 

as well as on the short arms of two in M. conformis and eight chromosomes 

pairs (pairs 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17 and 18) in M. simplex (Fig. 2c and d). 



                  

30 
 

The sequential fluorochrome staining revealed positive GC rich blocks 

(CMA3+) in only one pair, on the telomeric region, in M. conformis and on the 

pericentromeric region in M. simplex (Fig. 2e, f). DAPI showed general banding 

pattern coincident with the C-bands, indicating that the heterochromatin is AT 

rich (Fig. 2g and h). M. morschi did not show any GC or AT rich regions in 

either karyotype, since the chromosomes were stained uniformly. The results 

obtained are summarized in Table 1.  

 

Chromosome evolution 

 

 The results obtained in the analysis of chromosome evolution suggested 

that the best supported model of the process underpinning chromosome 

change was the hypothesis with constant gain, loss and duplication (log 

likelihood = -56.9052, AIC = 119.81). The rate parameters estimated in the 

best model were 16.52 for loss (?), 7.01 for gain (?) and 0.40 for duplication (?). 

The total inferred chromosome loss events were 181.41, gain 72.91 and 

duplication 1.70. These results revealed the occurrence of polyploidization 

events and suggested that whole karyotype duplication could have occurred 

during the chromosome evolution of these species. The main events inferred 

were loss (fusion) and gain (fission), which showed P.P.&gt;0.5. In the Bayesian 

analysis, the haploid chromosome number at the most recent common 

ancestor (MRCA) of Mycetophylax with highest posterior probability (PP) was 

n=17 and in the ML analysis the most likely haploid number was n=18 (Figure 

3).  

 To describe an evolutionary scenario for chromosome evolution inferred 

by ChromEvol to Mycetophylax, we focused on the haploid chromosome 

numbers estimated in the Bayesian method, since this method provides 

posterior probabilities (PP) as a statistical parameter. From the MRCA of the 

Mycetophylax species, the chromosome number decreased, becoming n=15 

(PP= 43) and subsequently, n=13 in the branch leading to M. morschi. 

Likewise, in the branch leading to M. conformis, the chromosome number 

decreased to n=15 (PP=63). In the case of M. simplex, the haploid chromosome 

number increased to n=18 (PP=74). 

The Bayesian time-calibrated tree allowed us to infer that the 

Mycetophylax species diverged from Cyphomyrmex during the Miocene, around 

~13 Ma (95%CI= 8.49-18.91, Fig. 5). This divergence was probably followed by 

chromosome changes. Considering the three species of Mycetophylax, M. 



                  

31 
 

morschi split early, around 9.1 Ma (95%CI= 5.75-14.34), whereas M. conformis 

and M. simplex split around ~6.62 Ma (95%CI= 3.22-10.32). The initial 

emergence of M. morschi karyotypes was estimated to have occurred during 

the Pleistocene, around ~2.29 Ma (95%CI= 0.31-4.72).  

Discussion 

 

We detected wide chromosomal variability among the species of the 

genus Mycetophylax. The three species analyzed showed different karyotypes 

and, in fact, we verified two different diploid chromosome numbers for M. 

morschi. However, the karyotypes did not show significant geographic 

structuring, since they were found in both the northern and southern 

occurrence areas of this species. In two sampled localities, Cabo Frio beach in 

the State of Rio de Janeiro and Chuí beach in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, 

we detected the karyotypes n=13 and n=15, though not living sympatrically on 

the same beach. Moreover, despite the large number of colonies analyzed, we 

did not find hybrid karyotypes. Thus, we suggest that these two karyotypes 

denote two different lineages throughout the distribution of M. morschi. These 

results are in agreement with the general rule that changes in the karyotype 

occur throughout species diversification (Lorite &amp;amp; Palomeque, 2010). As show 

in their review, usually when species from one genus are cytogenetically 

analyzed they show polymorphic karyotypes regarding both number and 

morphology. 

The cytogenetic data available for Attini, however, are so scarce that it is 

premature to assume that the chromosome numbers verified for the genus 

Mycetophylax are in agreement with the common chromosome counts reported 

for this tribe. Its sister group, Cyphomyrmex, presents only three species with 

known karyotypes and they show different haploid chromosome numbers: C. 

costatus and C. cornutus have a low chromosome number of n=10 and n=11, 

respectively, whereas C. rimosus presents n=16 chromosomes. Other genera of 

Attini also display similar variance in the chromosome number, with the 

exception of the leafcutter ants, which are reported to have a more 

homogenous chromosome number, with the majority of the species that have 

been analyzed presenting n=19 in Acromyrmex and all species in Atta 

presenting a haploid number of 11 chromosomes (Mariano et al., 2011) 

Both karyotypes of M. morschi showed nine pairs of metacentric 

chromosomes and one acrocentric pair, whereas the other two species 

presented only metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. According to 



                  

32 
 

molecular phylogenetic analysis (Cardoso et al., 2013), the genus 

Mycetophylax is divided into two major linages. One is composed only by the 

species M. morschi and the other comprises M. conformis and M. simplex. Since 

the last two species are more closely related to each other, the majority of 

metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes may be a characteristic shared 

by M. conformis and M. simplex. Furthermore, the pair of acrocentric 

chromosomes common to the karyotypes of M. morschi may be a 

symplesiomorphic chromosomal character retained from the ancestor that was 

lost in the lineage that diversified into M. simplex and M. conformis. On the 

other hand, this chromosome rearrangement could be one of the karyotypical 

characters that differentiate M. morschi from the others. 

The different karyotypes verified in M. morschi can be explained by 

chromosome rearrangements that change both chromosome morphology and 

diploid number, probably through centric fission. For instance, a biarmed 

chromosome breaks apart at the centromere and produces two telomeric 

chromosomes, followed by pericentromeric inversions or chromatin growth, 

resulting in the two new submetacentric chromosomes found in karyotypes 

n=15. This mechanism would have occurred at least twice to produce the two 

additional submetacentric pairs in the M. morschi lineage n=15. Indeed, based 

on the cytogenetic study of Myrmecia spp. (pilosula group), Imai et al. (1994) 

proposed ?the minimum-interaction theory?, wherein the karyotype changes 

tend towards increasing the number of chromosomes in order to minimize the 

threats of deleterious rearrangements due to the interaction of chromosomes 

within the nucleus. In general, this model predicts an increase in chromosome 

number due to centric fission, followed by chromatin addition (mainly 

heterochromatin) or pericentrometric inversions (for details see Imai et al., 

1994; Imai et al., 2001). According to this hypothesis the ancestral karyotype 

of M. morschi would be n=13, reaching n=15 by mean of fission 

rearrangements. 

However, based on our analysis of chromosome evolution, the recovered 

ancestral haploid chromosome number between karyotypes of M. morschi was 

n=15, suggesting that the karyotype n=13 probably arose due to tandem 

fusion from the karyotype with n=15 chromosomes. The karyotypes do not 

show any absence of the medium size chromosomes, which would be expected 

in the case of centric fission from 13 to 15 haploid chromosomes, or 

acrocentric chromosomes in the karyotypes n=15, which could have occurred 

in the case of centric fusion from n=15 chromosomes to n=13. The minimum 



                  

33 
 

interaction theory predicts that fission is likely to be the main rearrangement 

shaping chromosome evolution in ants, but does not reject the importance of 

fusions. This mechanism would lead the karyotype to chromosome number 

reduction due to a random occurrence, followed by retention and positive 

selection if it provided short-term advantages (see Imai et al., 1986; Imai et al., 

1994). Likewise, the contemporary haploid chromosome number of M. 

conformis seems to be produced by fusion, decreasing from n=17 to n=15. The 

estimated ancestral haploid chromosome number between M. confomis and M. 

simplex was n=17, which is also the ancestral state estimated for the genus 

Mycetophylax. Thus, the karyotype number verified for M. simplex may have 

evolved due to centric fission instead of fusion, since it shows a haploid 

number of 18 chromosomes. 

Ants with high chromosome numbers (n &gt; 12) tend to show 

Robertsonian polymorphisms as the main rearrangements during the 

evolution of their karyotypes (Imai et al., 1986). Thus, the chromosome 

numbers can decrease through centric fusion or increase through centric 

fission. Currently, the majority of works that evaluate karyotype evolution 

within genera advocate in favor of centric fission and pericentric inversions as 

the main chromosomal rearrangements determining karyotypes, e.g. regarding 

Ponerinae ants, the suggestion is that chromosome changes occurred in the

evolution of the genera Odontomachus and Anochetus  (Santos et al., 2010). 

The authors explained that centric fission is the principal evolutionary force 

acting on the karyotypes of Odontomachus, resulting in a larger, more stable 

karyotype mainly composed of subtelocentric chromosomes, compared with 

Anochetus, which is characterized by extreme karyotype diversification ranging 

from n=12 to n=23 and mainly composed of metacentric chromosomes. 

However, tandem fusion has been proposed to drive karyotype differentiation 

in a few cases (reviewed by Lorite &amp;amp; Palomeque, 2010). In Myrmecia pilosula, 

this chromosome rearrangement was used to explain the origin of a long 

metacentric chromosome through the fusion of a subtelocentric and an 

acrocentric chromosome (Imai &amp;amp; Taylor, 1989). Chromosome fusion was also 

suggested to be involved in the genus Acromyrmex, due the decrease in the 

chromosome number, from n=19 to n=18, in Acromyrmex ameliae (Barros, 

2010). Notwithstanding, tandem fusion has also been reported to be involved 

in chromosome rearrangements for great number of other animals, including 

grasshoppers (Warcha?owska-?liwa et al., 2013; Hemp et al., 2013), wasps 

(Gokhman, 2009) and bats (Rodrigues et al., 2003).

The C-banding technique and fluorochrome staining confirmed the 

cytotaxonomic groups distinguished by chromosome morphology analysis. 

Both karyotypes of M. morschi showed minimal amounts of heterochromatin 

restricted to the centromeric region and uniform staining for fluorochrome 

CMA3 and DAPI. In contrast, M. conformis and M. simplex comprise a distinct 

group with intermediate to large amounts of heterochromatin and evident AT- 

and CG-rich regions. The banding patterns shared by M. conformis and M. 

simplex suggest that their chromosomes underwent rearrangements following 

the split from a common ancestor related to M. morschi. Moreover, the amount 

of heterochromatin found in M. simplex is in agreement with the higher DNA 

content of this species (Cardoso et al., 2012). The DAPI banding was 

coincident with the C-banding blocks in both species, suggesting that the 

heterochromatin is AT-base-pair-rich. The main constitute of heterochromatin 

is repeated sequences, such as satellite DNA. It has been suggested that these 

sequences are the most rapidly evolving component of the genome and thus 

contribute to the rearrangements (Lorite &amp;amp; Palomeque, 2010). Hence, the 

specific heterochromatic pattern observed in the species studied here may be 

the result of a long-term evolutionary process with tandem duplication, 

transposable elements, as well as epigenetic factors, such as methylation of 

DNA, thought to play an important role in compacting and organizing the 

genome into distinct chromatic domains (Ma et al., 2005; Grewal &amp;amp; Jia, 2007). 

Based on fluorochrome staining, we were also able to identify other 

synapomorphic chromosomal characters shared by M. conformis and M. 

simplex. One pair of chromosomes of these two species showed positive CG-

rich regions, absent in M. morschi. These GC-positive blocks were located in 

the telomeric region in M. conformis and in the pericentromeric region in M. 

simplex. This difference can be explained by paracentric inversion. It has been 

thought that for ants and some other insects the chromosome pair bearing 

this GC-rich positive block is associated with the nucleolus organizer region 

(NOR) (Cardoso et al., 2012). This suggests that the rDNA sequences present 

in these chromosomes are interspaced by sequences rich in CG base pairs. 

This pattern has also been observed in other animals, such as fishes (Vidotto 

et al., 2004).  

The interspecific karyotype variability found among the species of the 

genus Mycetophylax could be associated with the biological environment 

where these species are restricted. As mentioned above, these species are 

confined to sand dune habitats along the Atlantic coast. This area is known to 



                  

35 
 

have been strongly influence during the Quaternary, having been remodeled 

due to periods of transgression and regression of the sea level (Dillenburg &amp;amp; 

Hesp, 2009). Our results suggested that the genus Mycetophylax diverged from 

Cyphomyrmex during the middle Miocene (~13 Ma) and diversified into the 

current species between the end of the Miocene and the beginning of the 

Pliocene. These periods are marked by deep modifications in the landscape 

that could facilitate the isolation of populations, culminating in the 

accumulation of chromosome mutations that could favor speciation and the 

evolution of new taxa. We suggest that an ancestor of these species was 

distributed along the Atlantic coast and later, due to transgressive movements 

of the sea, the geographic distribution was split by rising sea levels, producing 

barriers and sandy islands where the speciation process took place. The 

distinct karyotypes of M. morschi arose during the Pleistocene, a period 

extensively reported to have influenced the diversification of species in the 

Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Carnaval &amp;amp; Moritz, 2008), which includes its 

coastline. Highly intra and inter-specific karyotype variability is also reported 

for the genus Ctenomys (Freitas, 2006), a subterranean rodent that has 

habitat requirements and a distribution pattern similar to Mycetophylax. 

Thus, the sand dune environments on the Atlantic Coast of Brazil and their 

geological history could have acted as a trigger for chromosomal

rearrangements and the subsequent speciation in these areas.   

This is the first comprehensive cytogenetic description and evolutionary 

analysis of an Attini genus based on molecular data and provides a baseline 

for future comparative and integrative studies. Based on our chromosome 

evolution approach and cytogenetic banding techniques, we hypothesized that 

fusions instead of fission could be involved in the chromosome evolution of the 

Mycetophylax genus. These chromosome rearrangements likely took place by 

involving complete genetic isolation of the two major lineages within 

Mycetophylax that therefore established their own evolutionary strategies. One 

of these lineages diversified into the M. morschi group complex and the other 

diversified into M. simplex and M. conformis. Overall, the results presented in 

this study confirm that tandem fusion could very well participate in 

chromosome ant evolution. It is important that studies involving cytogenetic 

data within genus and between related genera are continued and that these 

studies take into account molecular phylogenic methods in the evaluation of 

the cytogenetic data.

Abstract 

 

Aim: Several species inhabiting forests experienced demographic and range 

contractions over glacial periods in the past. However, species living outside 

these wet habits have been shown to present a variable number of responses 

to Quaternary events. Here we investigated the genetic diversity distribution of 

the endemic sand dune ant Mycetophylax simplex across its whole range along 

the Brazilian coast.  

 

Location: Southern and south-eastern sandy dune environments (?restinga?) 

along the Atlantic Forest (AF) biome. AF represents an excellent opportunity to 

draw a phylogeographical hypothesis due to its wide range of vegetation types 

that includes open habitats covered predominantly by herbaceous and 

shrubby plants, strongly influenced by sea. 

 

Method: We used partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome 

oxidase I from 108 specimens to assess the phylogeography and demographic 

history of this species. To achieve this we performed different methods of 

phylogenetic and standard population genetic analysis.  

 

Results: The observed genetic diversity distribution and historical 

demographic profile suggested that M. simplex does not agree to the expected 

scenario for others AF species, but rather underwent demographic and range 

expansion during glacial periods. This was confirmed by shallow 

phylogeographic structure along the populations analyzed with isolation by 

distance effect. Our coalescent approach indicated two starting pulses in the 

population expansion that was coincident with the low sea-level during the 

Quaternary. Such demographic events were likely shaped by the enlargement 

of shorelines during marine transgression/regression and habitat 

release/evolution.  

 

Main conclusion: Our overall results are in agreement with log-term 

persistence showed by coastal sand dune and grassland species. Beyond that, 

we add an important framework about how both, glacial and interglacial, 

events could positively affect species distribution and diversification along 

south Atlantic Coast.

Introduction 

 

Climatic fluctuations during the late Quaternary associated with the 

last glacial maximum (LGM) have had a strong impact on the current 

distribution of many animal and plant species worldwide. Climate change not 

only affected the landscape of continental areas but also the sea level, which 

in turn shaped coastal landscapes by forming land bridges, islands, sand 

coastal plains, as well as connecting and separating areas (Hewitt, 2000; 

Dillenburg &amp;amp; Hesp, 2009). All these climate-linked processes may have 

influenced the evolutionary history of the species, especially those inhabiting 

coastal areas (Crottini et al., 2012, Barker et al., 2012). 

Pollen data, fossil records, and palaeoclimatic data indicate that 

numerous taxa in the Northern hemisphere were restricted during the period 

of glaciation to southern or eastern refugia (Stewart &amp;amp; Lister, 2001), and 

phylogeographic studies show how expansion from these sites has molded 

their distribution today (Hewitt, 2004; Hewitt, 2011; Vialatte et al., 2008, 

Widmer et al., 2012). In contrast, less is known about these phenomena in the 

Southern hemisphere, where the glacial refugia hypothesis has only recently 

been formally evaluated (Carnaval &amp;amp; Moritz, 2008; Carnaval et al., 2009). It is 

presently the most common used mechanism to explain the current 

distribution of species diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), the 

second largest Neotropical forest after the Amazon rainforest.  

AF covers more than 3.300 km along the eastern coast of Brazil. It has 

received worldwide attention because of its high biodiversity and great level of 

endemism and was determined as one of the 25 world biodiversity hotspots 

with high priority in conservation (Myers, 2000, Carnaval et al., 2009). The AF 

presents a wide range of vegetation types with conspicuous changes across 

landscapes, which include open habitats covered predominantly by 

herbaceous and shrubby plants, which develop on marine deposits 

(?Restinga?). Despite of an increasing number of phylogeographic studies, the 

knowledge about the evolutionary history of AF is still limited and 

controversial (Grazziton et al., 2006; Carnaval &amp;amp; Moritz, 2008, Fitzpatrick, et 

al., 2009, Thomé et al., 2010; Resende et al, 2010, Pinheiro et al., 2011, 

Ribeiro et al., 2011, Tonini et al., 2013). The refugia hypothesis has gained 



                  

52 
 

support by increasing number of phylogeographical studies that attempt to 

explain the high diversity in AF (Grazziton et al., 2006, Thomé et al., 2010, 

Resende et al., 2010). Basically, it states that during glaciation, when the 

climate was drier in the Southern hemisphere, forests contracted and 

persisted only in moister areas. These became refugia for humidity-dependent 

species. By vicariant processes, these refugia promoted speciation and 

therefore, today they harbor a higher genetic diversity and endemism than 

areas that did not serve as refugia (Hewitt 2000).  

The retreat of forests and the changed global climate conditions may 

have allowed the expansion of drought-tolerant biomes (Behling &amp;amp; Negrelle 

2001; Behling 2002). These authors suggested that open and dry vegetation in 

southern and eastern regions of South America, including those that occur 

along Atlantic coast, expanded during the drier periods throughout climatic 

oscillations. Compared to species restricted to refugia, species associated with 

open habitats may have experienced recurrent shifts in their distribution, with 

populations mixing or separating from each other with the cyclical shrinking 

or expanding of forests. Alternatively, their distribution may have remained 

largely unchanged during these historical events. While several species 

associated with wet forest environments have been used to infer the 

evolutionary processes occurring during the Quaternary in the Atlantic Forest, 

only a few studies have addressed organisms ? exclusively plants ? associated 

with dry environments (see Pinheiro et al., 2011).  

Mycetophylax simplex is a small fungus-growing ant (Formicidae: 

Myrmicinae) endemic to sand dunes environment along the Brazilian coast, 

occurring from southern São Paulo State to Rio Grande do Sul (Cardoso et al., 

2012). Although this ant exhibits a wide distribution, it is restricted to 

specialized habitats (sand dunes), making it a good model organism to test 

different phylogeographical scenarios relative to open / dry coastal 

environments. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the genetic 

relationship among populations of M. simplex across-its whole distribution and 

to infer how the Quaternary oscillations have affected genetic diversity and 

structure of its populations. Based on DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 

gene cytochrome oxidase (COI) and the nuclear gene wingless, we aimed to 

test if (i) M. simplex underwent a persistent range or population expansion 

during the climatic oscillations of the Quaternary and if and how (ii) its 

demographic history was affected by the cyclic changes in the sea level.

Material and Methods 

 

Sampling and laboratory procedures 
 

A total of 108 colonies of M. simplex, spanning its whole distribution 

area, were collected over the period between January and September 2011 

(Figure 1). The geographical references and sample size of all sampled sites are 

given in the Table 1. The specimens were preserved in 100% ethanol until DNA 

extraction. We extracted the whole genomic DNA from one individual per 

colony, totalizing 108 sequenced individuals. To ensure that estimates of 

population differentiation and diversity were reliable, adjacent sampled sites 

(beaches) were merged into a unique population based on dispersal capability 

of Attini, and then comprising sample sizes with at least eight colonies. 

 Genomic DNA was extracted using proteinase K digestion followed by a 

standard CTAB protocol (Sambrook &amp;amp; Russell, 2001). Fragments of the 

mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the nuclear gene 

wingless, both known to be useful in intra-specific studies (Medihabadi et al., 

2012) were amplified by PCR using four previously published primers 

LCO1490 (Folmer et al., 1994) and Ben (Kronauer et al., 2004) for COI and 

Wg578F (Ward et al., 2005) and Wg1032R (Abouheif et al., 2002) for wingless. 

The fragments of COI ranged from 800 to 950 bp long and comprised an 

overlapping region that resulted in assembled sequences typically with 1,100 

bp. Fragments of wingless had 386 bp to 411 bp, resulting in an assembled 

sequence with 373 bp. 

Amplification of the genes was conducted in 25 µL final volume 

reactions containing: MgCl2 (2.5mM), buffer reaction (1x; Promega), dNTPs (1 

mM each), a pair of primers (0.48 µM each), Taq polymerase (2 U of GoTaq® 

Flexi DNA Polymerase) and 1 µL of template DNA. PCR cycling conditions was 

as follows: initial denaturation for 2 min at 94ºC, then 35 cycles of 94ºC for 1 

min, an annealing temperature of 50ºC or 55°C for 1 min for COI and 

wingless, respectively, 72ºC for 2 min, and then a final extension at 72ºC for 7 

min. Finally, PCR products were purified and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. 

(www.macrogen.com) directly using the same primers of amplification in an 

ABI PRISM 3700 sequencing system. Singletons were checked by sequencing a 

second individual from the same colony when available.

Analysis  

 

 The chromatograms of each gene were evaluated and edited separately 

using the program Consed (Gordon et al., 1998). Afterwards, they were 

analyzed by translation into amino acids using the program MEGA 5.0 

(Tamura et al., 2011). All sequences were deposited in GenBank. The wingless 

gene was assumed to be single-copy because only one band was observed on 

gels after the amplification by PCR. Since wingless did not show intraspecific 

variation throughout the sampled populations, subsequent analysis was 

conducted only with the mitochondrial gene COI. Further evaluation of 

additional nuclear genes (long-wave rhodopsin and abdominal A) showed 

similar results (data not shown).  

 Sequence variation was analyzed by mean of Mega 5.0 software and the 

diversity parameters, including nucleotide diversity (?) and haplotype diversity 

(h) were computed using the software DNASP 5 (Tamura et al., 2011) for each 

population and for the complete data set.  

 In order to assess the correlation between genetic diversity and 

geographical distances among sampling populations, i.e. testing for isolation-

by-distance (IBD), we carried out a Mantel test. For this we used the program 

ALLELES IN SPACE ? AIS (Miller, 2005) to test correlation between log-

transformed genetic and geographic distance of individuals. The genetic 

differentiation among M. simplex populations was measured by means of F-

statistics (Excoffier et al., 1992). Pairwise comparisons of FST between 

populations were first calculated using the program ARLEQUIN 3.5 (Excoffier 

&amp;amp; Lischir, 2010). By this we could identify barriers to genetic flow among 

populations of M. simplex.  

We also carried out a spatial analysis of molecular variance using the 

program SAMOVA 1.0 (Dupanloup et al., 2002) to search for partitions of 

sampling sites that were genetically homogenous but maximally differentiated 

from each other. Based on a pre-specified K this method uses simulated 

annealing procedures to seek for a better clustering option that can be defined 

between groups of populations by the among group genetic variation 

coefficient (FCT). Analyses were conducted five times to check consistency and 

based on 1000 simulated annealing steps with the number of K groups 

increasing from 2 to 9. Thus, we could identify the clustering of samples that 

yielded the largest, and most significant, FCT for a given K. 



                  

55 
 

The phylogenetic relationships among M. simplex haplotypes were 

investigated using two methods: the Median Joining network algorithm 

implemented in the NETWORK 4.6 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com) and 

the statistical parsimony procedure for phylogenetic network estimation, with 

95% criterion for a parsimonious connection applied in TCS 1.21 (Clement et 

al., 2000). Based on this, we could determine if gene genealogy matches with 

geographically separated populations. This analysis also provided a more 

accurate estimate of intraspecific gene genealogies even in cases of shallow 

genetic divergence among haplotypes (Posada &amp;amp; Crandall, 2001). We also used 

Bayesian inference performed in MRBAYES 2.3 (Ronquist &amp;amp; Huelsenbeck, 

2003) to infer gene genealogies among unique haplotypes of M. simplex in 

order to evaluate nodal support and assess the monophyletic status of this 

species. We selected the model of nucleotide evolution for each codon that best 

fit to our data set using the Akaike?s information criterion (AIC) implemented 

in MRMODELTEST 2.3 (Nylander, 2004). The Bayesian analyses consisted of 

two independent runs of ten million generations each, sampled every 1000 

generations. The convergence among runs was verified by the average 

standard deviation of split frequencies that was&amp;lt;0.01. Then, mixing and 

appropriated burn-in was determined using Tracer v1.4 (Rambaut &amp;amp; 

Drummond, 2007). A total of 25% of the tree was burned out to produce a 

consensus topology. Finally, the Bayesian topology was visualized using the 

FIGTREE v1.3.1 program (Rambaut, 2009). 

Trends in the demographic history of M. simplex populations were 

investigated using three different approaches. First, under the assumption of 

neutrality deviations in Tajima?s and Fu?s FS statistics we tested for past 

population expansions. A negative value in both statistic tests would reflect 

either purifying selection in a population at mutation-drift equilibrium, or 

deviations from mutation-drift equilibrium, resulting from population 

expansion. Second, we observed the distribution of pairwise nucleotide 

differences among haplotypes and tested the deviation from the expected 

mismatch distribution under sudden and spatial model by means of a 

generalized least-squares method and Harpending?s h statistic. Both analyses 

were carried out in Arlequin 3.5. Third, we used a Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) 

approach (Drummond et al., 2005), implemented in BEAST 1.6.1 (Drummond 

&amp;amp; Rambaunt, 2007), with the aim to recover changes in the effective 

population size (Ne) over time. For this, we first estimated a mutation rate for 

the genus Mycetophylax from the COI sequences and fossil calibration of the 



                  

56 
 

molecular phylogeny of the tribe Attini (Mehdiabadi et al., 2012). Mutation rate 

estimation was performed under an uncorrelated lognormal-relaxed clock 

model using the model of sequence evolution GTR+I+? with three partitions 

(codons 1, 2, and 3) with a random starting tree underneath a Yule speciation 

process as tree prior. Based on Cyphomyrmex rimosus group fossils, to the 

root node was given a lognormal distribution with mean of 1.6, standard 

deviation of 1.0 and offset equal 15, as described in Mehdiabadi et al., (2012). 

The results from three independent runs of 50 million generations sampled 

every 5,000 and with a burning of 15 million were combined in TRACER 1.4.1 

and checked for adequate mixing of the MCMC chains by mean of values 

effective sample size (ESS). Finally, we used the mutation rate calculated 

above on our intraspecific COI data set in order to construct the timing and 

magnitude of changes in the effective population size using the Bayesian 

Skyline (BS) method (Drummond et al., 2005). This model was used to 

estimate the effective population size through time since the most recent 

common ancestor of M. simplex. Therefore, BEAST software had its molecular 

clock set to Uncorrelated Log-normal under a Relaxed Clock and analyses 

were performed using the SRD06 with distinct rates of sequence evolution for 

each codon partition. Results from three independent runs with 50 000 000 

generations each, from which the initial 10% were burned out were combined 

and checked in Tracer 1.4.1 as described below.  

 

Results 

 

Sequence variation, phylogenetic relationships and structure 

 

A total of 845 base pairs of the gene COI were sequenced and comprised 

32 unique haplotypes widely sampled across the distribution range of M. 

simplex. From these resolved nucleotide sites we observed 32 polymorphic 

sites, being 19 singleton variables, 13 parsimony informative and a bias 

against guanidine (T: 36.2%. C: 20.3%, A: 31.9% G: 11.6%). All nucleotide 

substitutions were located at the third position of the codon and transitions 

(Ti) were proportional to transversion (Tv), thereby the ratio of Ti:Tv was 0.73, 

suggesting no saturation in relation to substitution. Overall haplotype and 

nucleotide diversity was 0.865 ± 0,022 and 0.00346 ±  0,00019 (mean ± SD), 

respectively (Table 2). In Bayesian and ML phylogenetic analysis (data not 

shown), posterior probabilities and bootstrapping values indicated that M.

simplex formed a well-supported monophyletic clustering and that all 

specimens evaluated throughout the distribution could be considered as 

belonging to the same species.  

The Median Joining haplotype network was in agreement with the 

statistical parsimony network. The gene genealogy among the haplotypes 

considering a 95% threshold for the probability of a parsimonious connection 

was achieved, so all the haplotypes were joined in the same single network 

(Figure 2). The network did not indicate divergent clades within genealogies of 

M. simplex and substantial genetic diversity could be seen due to many unique 

haplotypes. Two major haplotype represented 50% of the individuals: H3 

represented 27.7% of the individual and seems to be widespread across the 

species range, whereas the haplotype H11 was almost restricted to the 

northern range of the species distribution and was separated from the other 

by missing intermediate haplotypes (Figure 2). Large portions of the found 

haplotypes were singleton (Table 1), but no more than two nucleotide 

substitutions separated immediate haplotypes (Figure 2).   

There was no apparent association between genetic structure and 

geography concerning the haplotypes, since they were widespread within the 

bounders of M. simplex distribution (Figure 2 and 3). The most frequent 

haplotype (H3) could be found in populations covering fully the southern and

northern studied areas (Figure 3).  

However, considering the pairwise FST comparisons between 

populations, we could identify major genetic drifts along the analyzed 

populations of M. simplex. Population from the southern distribution and from 

the north (starting from Itapirubá/Garopaba/Pinheira ? SC6) showed no 

significant genetic differentiation and lower FST values among them (Table 3), 

suggesting that gene flow should be occurring among them. However, the gene 

flow between these populations is restricting leading to some genetic structure 

among M. simplex haplotypes. Thus, we could identify that the haplotypes of 

M. simplex are shallowly structured into three major population groups: 

Southern populations including RS1 and RS2 (green shading Table 3), Core-

East populations including RS3, SC4 and SC5 (yellow shading Table 3) and 

finally, the Northern population, were including the remainder ones (red 

shading Table 3).  

In line with these results, the Mantel test showed that genetic and 

geographic distance are slightly correlated (r = 0.075, p = 0.0007), suggesting 

that there is a weak degree of isolation by distance. Furthermore, the spatial 



                  

58 
 

analysis of molecular variance implemented in SAMOVA was not able to 

identify possible breaks among populations. All parameters showed small 

range of variation (Figure 4) and any FCT calculated for a given K group 

suggested better explaining about the genetic structure of M. simplex. The FCT 

values slightly differed from each other (0.22-0.26) and did not show any trend 

of increasing or decreasing with K. Besides, the major proportion of variance 

was within-population variation, ranging from 76% to 83% (Figure 4b). 

Demographic history  

 
We observed a shallow phylogeographic structure in M. simplex 

populations; therefore the historical demography analysis was conducted for 

the complete set of haplotypes. The neutrality tests allowed us to identify some 

statistical significant signatures for expanding population for both tests. The 

extremely negative and significant values of Tajima?s D (-1.47062, P = 0.0422) 

and Fu?s FS (-21.59803 P = 0.0001) suggested that haplotype frequencies differ 

from that expected from a neutral population. Yet, the distribution of pairwise 

nucleotide differences between haplotypes had a bimodal shape in the 

mismatch distribution (Figure 5a), which is expected for populations that have 

shown constant population demography. However, both models of population 

expansion could not be rejected. Harpending?s raggedness h statistic (R2) and 

the sum of square differences (SSD) supported a close fit to the observed 

distribution under a pure demographic expansion model (SDD = 0.00754, p = 

0.62760; R2 = 0.01864, p = 0.86400) and under a sudden spatial expansion 

model (SSD = 0.00905, p = 0.40100; R2 = 0.01864, p = 0.84750).  

The tMRCA for all M. simplex haplotypes was recovered to be 0.197 Mya 

(with 95% highest posterior density, HPD, of: 0.699-0.355). The analysis of 

Bayesian Skyline Plot provided an additional strong support for the evidence of 

past population expansion (Figure 5c). The results suggested that M. simplex 

underwent a long-term period of demographic population stability since the 

tMRCA until ~70,000 years ago. We could observe that the expansion had a 

second increasing cline around 25,000 years ago, corroborating the observed 

mismatch distribution.

Discussion 

 

The impact of Quaternary climatic fluctuation and geological events 

underpinning the biodiversity of Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been object of 

discussion of innumerous studies based on the evaluation of the genetic 

structure of wet associated environment species (WAES). Here, we aimed to 

contribute to this discussion by exploring the population genetic structure 

under a phylogeographic perspective of M. simplex, a not WAES ant species.  

A shallow phylogeographic pattern was observed throughout the 

distribution of M. simplex along the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. In fact, the 

genealogical relationships among haplotypes were not associated with 

geographically separated sampled sites. Further, the spatial analysis of 

population structure implemented by SAMOVA could not recognize a 

congruent grouping that better explains the observed genetic structure of M. 

simplex. In sum, our results suggest that M. simplex reveal low levels of 

genetic drift and that genetic bottleneck due to extinction are restrict, since 

these two processes would decrease genetic diversity and increase genetic 

differentiation among populations.  

Clearly recognizable geographical barriers could not be identified across 

the extensive sandy coastal plain where M. simplex occurs, from southern São 

Paulo to Chuí in Rio Grande do Sul State. For instance, long water bodies as 

rivers and the estuarine complex of the Paranaguá Bay apparently does not to 

impair the gene flow among northern areas, since population from 

Florianópolis (SC) to ?Ilha Comprida? (SP) were genetically similar.  

Contrasting phylogeographic patterns have been reported for species 

associated to wet environments in AF, where rivers systems had played an 

important role as physical barriers to gene flow (Pellegrino et al., 2005, 

Resende et al., 2010). Patterns of genetic diversity geographically structured 

have also been postulated as a consequence to glacial refugia in AF when 

forests were fragmented during glacial periods (Carnaval et al., 2009; Thomé et 

al., 2010). Under this scenario it would be expected that a long-term isolation 

of species in multiple fragments would shed genetic signatures (i.e. higher 

genetic variability than recolonized areas), resulting in reciprocally 

monophyletic linages in current populations. 

In the analysis through M. simplex lineages we did not observed such 

signatures or monophyletic lineages among haplotypes. Indeed, the 

widespread North-South division pattern generally reported for other AF 



                  

60 
 

species (e.g. Grazziotin et al., 2006; Resende et al., 2010) was not observed in 

the genealogical relationships of M. simplex haplotypes. This suggests that 

long-term allopatric population divergence has not taken place in this sand 

dune restrict species. Our results also support the idea that barriers should 

have different effects on distinct organisms.  

By contrast, an alternative hypothesis for the phylogeographic pattern 

observed for M .simplex is an enduring persistence of its populations along the 

seashore of the Atlantic coast and unrestricted gene-flow crossways South-

Northern regions. In fact, Tropical forests (including wet AF) were reduced 

during the Quaternary ice ages, imposing the contraction of species 

distribution and vicariant process (Hewitt, 2000, 2004). Yet, the drier and 

cooler environment during the ice ages in the Neotropics promoted the 

expansion of open and scrub environments in southern Brazil which included 

the sand dunes areas along the Atlantic coast (Behling &amp;amp; Negrelle, 2001, 

Moraes et al., 2009). Since the dry sand dune environments are the current 

and restricted habitats where M. simplex lives, the absence of phylogeographic 

structure among the haplotypes of this species is in agreement with the 

geomorphologic history of this area, suggesting that M. simplex may have not 

experienced shifts in their distribution. This result is consistent with 

phylogeographic patterns reported for a coastal orchid species with similar 

range distribution (Pinheiro et al., 2011). Together, these results suggest that 

an alternative scenario such as the range persistence through the past 

climatic oscillations may have contributed to the distribution of coastal 

lowland species in AF. Furthermore, similar patterns have been reported to 

other sand dune or coastal species worldwide (Mora et al., 2006, Piñeiro et al., 

2007, King et al., 2009, Frey et al., 2012).   

The pairwise FST analysis allowed us to identify some breakdowns in 

gene flow amongst populations from the three major geographical regions 

(Table 03), likely as a result of IBD. Though weakly, there is some degree of 

isolation by distance among the populations of M. simplex. Besides, the 

haplotype H3 that are widely dispersed geographically are localized in interior 

of the network. This supports the known idea that high-frequent haplotypes 

connected by multiple connections are most likely to be pleisomorphic. 

Therefore, long-term persistence and historic conservation of ancestral 

polymorphism within haplotypes shared between distant localities, rather than 

current gene flow, is a more likely scenario to explain such distribution 



                  

61 
 

pattern. Additionally, this could explain the uniformity of the nucleotide 

diversity values found across the entire north-southern species distribution.  

Pleistocene sea levels fluctuated considerably through the glacial and 

interglacial periods during the Quaternary. During Pleistocene, the Coastal 

Plain of the southern region of South America was larger than now (Ab?sáber, 

1990, 2001). Palaeo-geomorphological studies showed that sea-level was about 

120 meters lower than the present (Figure 1 and 5b), what represents an 

elongation of the coast-line limits to ~100 kilometers (Corrêa, 1996, Behling &amp;amp; 

Negrelle, 2001). This enlargement exposed the lowland on the coast and may 

have represented an increase in niche availability to M. simplex, leading to the 

expansion of its populations. We found genetic signatures that supported this 

hypothesis. The negative and highly significant Fu?s FS and Tajimas?s D 

showed departures from the neutrality. Hence, the Mismatch distribution 

detected imprints of both sudden and spatial demographic expansion in the 

past population of M. simplex. The historical demographic reconstruction 

based on BS plot showed that M. simplex underwent a stable demographic 

period shifting to a persistent growth of effective population size in recent 

periods. The population growth started around 70,000 years ago and displays 

a slight increase at around 25,000 years ago. These results indicated that the 

process underpinning the current diversity of M. simplex happened during the

middle-Pleistocene and intensified under different climatic and geological 

events imposed by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at Late-Pleistocene.  

It is noteworthy that both ?pulses? in the historical demography of M. 

simplex populations are in agreement with the two lower historic sea levels 

during the Quaternary, and the overall M. simplex historic demographic 

growing started and persisted during the major period of sea level fall (see 

Figure 5b, c). A reasonable explanation for the observed phenomenon is that 

historic demographic expansion occurred due the habitat release by both sea 

regression and AF shrinking during cool dry climate seasons that extended the 

open and scrub vegetation in south Brazil (Behling &amp;amp; Negrelle, 2001). These 

consequently favored the suitable habitats for M. simplex. It is reasonable to 

assume that the cooler climatic conditions during the Pleistocene (lower 

around 3-7 ºC), were not a constraint for the distribution of M. simplex, since 

this species seems to be intolerant to warm temperatures (Cardoso, pers. 

obs.).  

Nowadays, this species presents an almost exclusively subtropical 

distribution, to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn (23º S), except by one 



                  

62 
 

residual population at Cabo Frio beaches, in Rio de Janeiro state. The present 

distribution of M. simplex strengthens the important role of ocean 

transgression in shaping M. simplex distribution over the past. The 

northernmost limit of the current distribution is coincident with the major 

enlargement of the coastal lowland in Brazil, from southern Chuí in Rio 

Grande do Sul State to Cabo Frio in Rio de Janeiro State (Figure 1) (Corrêa, 

1996, see also Hewitt, 2000). South Brazil had pronounced marine regression 

from its continental shelf that was strongly distinct from the northern region 

(Corrêa, 1996), resulting in exposed lowland. These land bridges may have 

enabled migration of many organisms across the latitudinal gradient by 

forming sand corridors or sand islands due to coastal deposits. 

As mentioned before, resulting water bodies from regression and 

transgression of the sea or even the ocean should not represent an 

insurmountable obstacle for flying insects and may not impair the dispersion 

of ant species (Seal et al., 2011). However, it would be unreasonable to assume 

that sandy beaches corridors and sandy islands emerged promptly during 

Quaternary. Corrêa (1996) using sedimentary deposition analysis suggested 

that this region underwent at least three phases of sea stabilization up to the 

current level, lasting until 6,500 years ago. Thus, we could suggest that M. 

simplex had enough time to widespread across their distribution range until 

Cabo Frio beaches in Rio de Janeiro State, living in an almost panmictic 

population.  

It is important to note that there is a gap in the current distribution of 

M. simplex on the stretch of the coast between southern São Paulo and Cabo 

Frio. Its exclusion from the south-east Brazilian coastline could be explained 

by three not exclusive hypotheses: (i) Holocene marine transgression drowned 

the suitable M. simplex habitats; (ii) open habitats were removed by the 

expansion of the forests towards the seashore, which is currently covered by 

tropical rain AF; (iii) Competition with congeneric species.  

Overall, Rio de Janeiro is characterized by a rocky coastline with little 

development of transitional sedimentary coastal plains, due the proximity to 

the mountainous relief of Serra do Mar (Dias &amp;amp; Kjerfve, 2009). As an effect of 

Post Glacial Marine Transgression, the sea submerged the majority of sandy 

beach ridges; removing the M. simplex from this portion of Brazilian coastline. 

These ants could have survived in the region of Cabo Frio, protected from 

drowning by barriers that act as feasible refugia during the marine 

transgressive events. Cabo Frio and neighborhood is pointed out as the only 



                  

63 
 

sector of this portion of the east coastline to present Coastal aeolian dunes 

(Dias &amp;amp; Kjerfve, 2009). These barriers are sand deposits from Pleistocene and 

also have been reported to act as a refugia spot for sand dune vegetation in 

south coast of Brazil (Pinheiro et al., 2011).  

Conversely, the expansion of AF towards the Atlantic coast may have 

facilitated M. simplex exclusion by removing open and sandy habits turning 

these areas no longer suitable. Post glacial AF expansion together with the rise 

of the sea have imposed the shrinkage of sand dune habitats, mainly between 

the south latitude 23º and 24º (Souza et al., 2008). Starting on north coast of 

São Paulo State, M. simplex could compete with other congeneric species (M. 

conformis) for food and nesting sites since both species nest near to seashore 

and use debris from sparse vegetation to grow up its fungus garden (see 

Klingenberg et al., 2007 for nesting details). M. conformis  seems to have 

higher ecological amplitude than M. simplex, being the former observed 

nesting also in shaded areas and workers performing tasks also during the 

day (Cardoso, pers. orbs.), whereas the later always nests on sunny open 

areas and is active only during dusk and overnight (Diehl-Fleig &amp;amp; Diehl, 2007). 

Thus the factors mentioned above may have reduced the local density of M. 

simplex, that culminated by been excluded due to competition pressure.  

Phylogeographic studies regarding species associated with open and dry 

environments have attracted much less attention compared to the number of 

studies using organisms associated with forests as study model. Identifying 

explicit phylogeographical patterns and the factors underpinning the genetic 

structure are reasonably difficult, particularly for those species inhabiting 

historic and dynamic regions, as coastal sand dunes. Our findings indicate 

that M. simplex presents a complex evolutionary history consistent with shifts 

in the sea-level and changes in the distribution of dry vegetation on south-

eastern Brazil. The diversification and expansion started in the mid-

Pleistocene, during which major climatic changes occurred worldwide. Our 

results are in agreement with other studies of sand dunes species that 

indicate expansion during glacial periods, but is contrasting with others, 

suggesting that a single and wide model of Quaternary effects on the 

diversification and distribution of species is unrealistic.

5. Considerações Finais 

 

Nos capítulos do presente estudo foram descritas as relações filogenéticas, 

a organização do genoma do ponto de vista citogenético e a evolução 

cromossômica das espécies endêmicas de restinga do gênero Mycetophylax. 

Além disso, foi descrito o padrão filogeográfico da espécie M. simplex associada 

aos ambientes de dunas da costa do Atlântico. Por meio do emprego destas 

diferentes abordagens busca-se contribuir para o entendimento da evolução 

destes organismos e da história dos ambientes costeiros de restinga. Podemos 

assim considerar:  

 

1. O gênero Mycetophylax na sua atual designação apresenta-se como um 

grupo monofilético;  

 

2. A espécie M. morschi, anteriormente incluída em Cyphomyrmex, 

indubitavelmente agrupa com M. simplex e M. conformis;  

 
3. A hipótese filogenética com base em caracteres moleculares concorda 

com as relações estabelecidas com base em dados morfológicos 

publicados na literatura; 

 
4. O número cromossômico verificado para colônias de M. morschi variou 

de 2n=26 a 2n=30 cromossomos, enquanto o número cromossômico 

diploide detectado para M. conformis e M. simplex foi de 30 e 36 

cromossomos, respectivamente; 

 
5. A variação cariotípica verificada para M. morschi foi atribuída a eventos 

de fusão cromossômica;  

 
6. Os padrões de bandamento indicam que as espécies M. simplex e M. 

conformis são proximamente relacionadas e diferem dos cariótipos de M. 

morschi quanto à quantidade de heterocromatina e composição das 

bases nucleotídicas AT/CG;  

 
7. A diversidade genética de M. simplex não foi correlacionada com a 

distribuição geográfica ao longo de sua área de distribuição; 

 
8. Haplótipos frequentes foram observados distribuídos ao longo de toda a 

costa sul e sudeste do Atlântico, onde M. simplex ocorre;  



                  

81 
 

 
9. A análise de demografia histórica evidenciou que as populações de M. 

simplex passaram por um período de estabilidade populacional com 

recentes eventos de expansão demográfica;  

 
10. Os eventos de expansão populacional foram coincidentes com os 

períodos mais baixos do nível dos oceânicos durante o Quaternário; 

 
11.  Os resultados obtidos na presente tese sugerem que a diversificação de 

Mycetophylax parece ter acompanhado as mudanças e evolução dos 

ambientes de restinga, que foi altamente dinâmico durante o 

Quaternário.
