SUMMARY

Fractal mathematics has been used to characterize water and solute transport
in porous media and also to characterize and simulate porous media properties.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the soil
infiltration parameters sorptivity (S) and time exponent (n) and the parameters
dimension (D) and the Hurst exponent (H).  For this purpose, ten horizontal columns
with pure (either clay or loam) and heterogeneous porous media (clay and loam
distributed in layers in the column) were simulated following the distribution of a
deterministic Cantor Bar with fractal dimension ? ? ? ? ? 0.63.  Horizontal water
infiltration experiments were then simulated using Hydrus 2D software.  The
sorptivity (S) and time exponent (n) parameters of the Philip equation were
estimated for each simulation, using the nonlinear regression procedure of the
statistical software package SAS®.  Sorptivity increased in the columns with the
loam content, which was attributed to the relation of S with the capillary radius.
The time exponent estimated by nonlinear regression was found to be less than
the traditional value of 0.5.  The fractal dimension estimated from the Hurst
exponent was 17.5 % lower than the fractal dimension of the Cantor Bar used to
generate the columns.

RESUMO:    MODELAGEM DE MOVIMENTO HORIZONTAL DE ÁGUA NO
SOLO UTILIZANDO A TEORIA DOS FRACTAIS

A matemática fractal tem sido utilizada para caracterizar o transporte de água e solutos
em meios porosos e também para simular características físicas e geométricas de meios porosos.
O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a correlação entre os parâmetros de infiltração de água
sortividade e expoente de tempo (n) e os parâmetros dimensão fractal (D) e expoente de Hurst
(H).  Para isso, dez colunas horizontais foram simuladas em computador, sendo preenchidas
com material de textura franca ou argilosa, puros ou em combinações de camadas alternadas
dos dois materiais, seguindo a distribuição de um Conjunto de Cantor determinístico com
dimensão fractal ? 0,63.  As simulações de movimento horizontal de água foram realizadas
no modelo numérico Hydrus 2D.  Os parâmetros sortividade (S) e expoente de tempo (n) da
equação de Philip foram estimados para cada simulação, utilizando o módulo de regressão
não linear do software SAS®.  A sortividade aumentou com o aumento de material de textura
franca nas colunas, o que foi atribuído à dependência do parâmetro S no raio capilar.  O
parâmetro expoente de tempo estimado por regressão não linear mostrou valor menor que o
valor empírico de 0,5 sugerido na literatura.  A dimensão fractal estimada utilizando o expoente
de Hurst foi 17,5 % menor do que a dimensão fractal do Conjunto de Cantor utilizado para
gerar as colunas.

INTRODUCTION

Fractal mathematics has been used to characterize
water and solute transport in porous media (Arya et
al., 1999; Pachepsky et al., 2000) and also to
characterize and simulate porous media properties
(Anderson et al., 2000).  From a non-fractal perspective,
the position of any volumetric water content within a
porous media column can be characterized by:

x = ?(?).tn (1)

where x = Vertical distance within the column [L], ?
= Boltzmann variable [L T-n], t = Elapsed time [T], n
= Time exponent, and ? = Porous media water content
[L3 L-3].

Similarly, the process of one-dimensional
infiltration of water into a uniform soil as a function
of time can be characterized by the Philip (1957)
equation:

I = S.tn (2)

where I = Cumulative one-dimensional infiltration [L],
and S = Sorptivity [L T-n].

In both (Equations 1 and 2) the time exponent (n)
was fixed at 0.5 (Clothier &amp;amp; Scotter, 2002).  However
in fractal characterization of water movement
processes in the soil, the time empirical coefficient
was estimated statistically, along with other hydraulic
properties (Guerrini &amp;amp; Swartzendruber, 1994;
Pachepsky &amp;amp; Timlin, 1998).

The diffusive process in a porous medium can be
interpreted as a self-affine fractal.  If this assumption
holds, there is experimental evidence that the

empirical coefficient n can be associated with fractal
parameters such as the Hurst exponent (Guerrini &amp;amp;
Swartzendruber, 1994).  The objective of this study
was to evaluate the correspondence between n and
fractal parameters: fractal dimension (D) and the
Hurst exponent (H).  For this purpose, horizontal
columns with heterogeneous porous media (i.e.  two
contrasting grain sizes) were generated following the
horizontal distribution of the first four iterations of a
deterministic Cantor Bar.  Experiments of water
transport were then simulated using Hydrus 2D
software (Rassam et al., 2003) and n and S parameters
were estimated for each simulation run using
nonlinear regression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Water infiltration was simulated using Hydrus 2D
software (Rassam et al., 2003).  The simulations were
performed at the Earth and Planetary Sciences
department of the University of Tennessee in
Knoxville, US, from August 2004 to May 2005.  Ten
porous media scenarios were created in Hydrus 2D
following the first four iterations of a deterministic
Cantor Bar (CB) with fractal dimension: D = log(2)/
log(3) ? 0.6309 and b = 3 (Figure 1).  Two materials
with distinct particle sizes were used to generate the
iterations of the CB, pure clay and pure loam.  The
criterion to define clay and loam materials was based
on the clay, silt and sand content of each material
(Figure 2).  The van Genuchten (1980) parameters
and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were higher
in the loam material (Table 1).

(Figure 1).  The columns were defined by a
combination of two materials (clay and loam) and five
iterations (i = 0 to 4) resulting in 10 treatments: two
materials x five iterations = 10 columns.  At the zeroth
iteration, infiltration was simulated in columns filled
in two ways: pure clay (CLAY0) and pure loam
(LOAM0) (Figure 3a).  For the subsequent iterations,
the two materials were layered horizontally within
the column following the distribution of the CB.  In
the first iteration, one loam layer was inserted in the
clay column (CLAY1) and one clay layer was inserted
in the loam column (LOAM1) (Figure 3b).  The filling
pattern following the CB distribution was used to
define each treatment until the fourth iteration
(Figure 3e) as follows: CLAY0; CLAY1; CLAY2;
CLAY3; CLAY4; and LOAM0; LOAM1; LOAM2;
LOAM3; LOAM4.  With increasing iterations, the
content of the interlayered material (i.e.  loam in the
clay column and clay in the loam column) increased
until exceeding the original material in the column
(Figure 3).

Each simulation represented a 10-min water
infiltration experiment for each column.  The initial
time step was 0.1 min and the minimum and
maximum were 0.01 and 0.5 min, respectively.  The
“cumulative water boundary fluxes” output files of
Hydrus 2D (Cum_Q.out) were used for the statistical
analysis of the results.  The files were imported into
Microsoft Excel® and converted to *.xls format.  The

Materials were mixed in 10 x 10 cm columns
following the iterations of a deterministic CB

time and cumulative volume infiltration were fitted
to equation 2 using nonlinear regression in the “nlin”
procedure of SAS®.  The parameters sorptivity (S) and
time exponent (n) were estimated by nonlinear
regression procedures.  Sorptivity was also estimated
with the time exponent fixed at 0.5 (Clothier &amp;amp; Scotter,
2002).  The estimated fractal dimension was calculated
following Feder (1989):

D = d – H (3)

where D = Fractal dimension, d = Euclidean dimension
(d = 1 for the Cantor Bar), H = Hurst exponent.

The Hurst exponent (H) was associated with the
time exponent (n) following (Guerrini &amp;amp; Swartzendruber,
1994).  The estimated fractal dimension could
therefore be calculated as:

D = 1 - n (4)

where all definitions were as above.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Infiltration simulations

Simulations of infiltration versus time in pure clay
and clay mixed with loam following the iterations of
the Cantor Bar (CB) are illustrated in figure 4.  The
cumulative infiltration rate increased as the loam
content increased with each iteration of the CB.  An
inverse behavior was observed in loam simulations
where the cumulative infiltration rate decreased as
the amount of clay increased within the columns
(Figure 5).

Soil sorptivity (S) was defined as the gravity-free,
capillary-induced absorption (Clothier &amp;amp; Scotter,
2002). The greater infiltration in the columns with
higher loam content is reflected in the Sorptivity (S)
plots as a function of iteration level (Figure 6).

Sorptivity decreased exponentially with each iteration
level in loam simulations and increased exponentially
for clay.  White &amp;amp; Sully (1987) found that S decreased
in soil materials following the order: fine Brindabella
fine sand &gt; Brindabella silty clay loam &gt; Molonglo
loam &gt; Bungendore fine Sand (70 %) &gt; Kaolinite
(30 %).  The overall sorptivity for increasing water
potentials was also greater for coarser material
(Pilliago sand) than in finer soil material
(Murrumbateman silty clay loam) in a study
conducted by White &amp;amp; Perroux (1989).  Mapa et al.
(1986) found that the overall S was greater in a silty
clay loam (Typic Torrox) than clay soil (Vertic
Haplustox).  Talsma (1969) also found a decrease of S
with particle size, and that S was one order of
magnitude greater in sand than in clay loam soil.

The results of the simulations in Hydrus 2D and
from the literature are evidence enough that sorptivity
is greater in coarser materials.  However this is
somewhat contrary to the sorptivity definition and
also to the intuitive knowledge that pure clays would
have a greater capillary absorption potential than
coarser materials.  Some hypotheses on why the

sorptivity would be higher in a coarse than in finer
media were therefore investigated.

Sorptivity is an integral soil-water property that
contains information about the soil hydraulic
conductivity, soil water potential and soil diffusivity
(White &amp;amp; Perroux, 1987).  In a first analysis, the
dependence of S on saturated hydraulic conductivity
(Ks) was investigated.  S and Ks are not independent
variables; Ks is roughly proportional to S2 (Clothier &amp;amp;
Scotter, 2002).  Following this premise, and using the
Ks values 3.33 x 10-3 and 1.72 x 10-2 cm s-1 for clay
and loam, respectively (Table 1), the estimated
sorptivities values would be around 0.06 for clay and
0.13 for loam.  These values, although roughly
estimated, are of the same order of magnitude as those
estimated based on simulations.  Therefore the
behavior observed in this research is once more
confirmed.

Sorptivity is also defined as a measure of the
capillary removal of water, being essentially a
property of the medium.  It is similar to the “capillary
absorption coefficient” which is proportional to the
square root of the capillary radius (Philip, 1957).
Therefore, the smaller the capillary radius (i.e.  the
finer the soil particle size), the smaller the “capillary
absorption coefficient” and thus, sorptivity.

Soil sorptivity is proportional to the pore diameter
of the medium.  The sorptivity of clay, despite a higher
capillary rise potential, was not higher than in the
loam material.  The early-time infiltration rates,
which are directly proportional to sorptivity, were also
lower in clay.  From these results and also from
literature it is possible to conclude that the lower
porosity of pure clays does not allow a higher
infiltration rate, despite a higher capillary rise
potential than in coarser materials.  Also, the
relationship between sorptivity and saturated
hydraulic conductivity is not clear enough to define
the real influence of Ks and gravity on early-time
infiltration.  Clear quantitative and qualitative
definitions on the significance of the term “early-time
infiltration” are also needed to improve the
interpretation of sorptivity experiments.

Fractal characterization of infiltration
process

Sorptivity estimated with the time exponent
parameter (n) fixed at 0.5 was not statistically
different from sorptivity estimated with n also
estimated in the nonlinear regression procedures
(Figure 7).  The variation of S estimated with varying
n at each iteration level for clay and loam is illustrated
in figure 8.  There are no visual differences between
figures 6 and 8.  The use of n fixed at 0.5 or n estimated
by regression procedures had no influence on the
estimated sorptivity value.  The estimated n values
were therefore used in the fractal characterization of
the infiltration process (Guerrini &amp;amp; Swartzendruber,
1994; Pachepsky &amp;amp; Timlin, 1998).

As described earlier, the estimated time exponent
(n) was associated with the fractal parameter Hurst
exponent (H) (Guerrini &amp;amp; Swartzendruber, 1994).  The
n = H values ranged from 0.43 to 0.49 (  = 0.48; ? =
0.028) in clay and from 0.47 to 0.49 (  = 0.49; ? =
0.008) in loam, where  = average and ? = standard
deviation.  The variation of the time exponent at each
iteration level for clay and loam is shown in figure 9.
The mean fractal dimension (Dc) value calculated from
n = H values of clay and loam, using equation 4, was
0.52.  The fractal dimension of the Cantor Bar used
to generate the soil columns (D) was approximately
0.63.  Therefore, the variation between Dc and D was
relatively small (around 17.5 %).

The Hurst exponent associated with the time
exponent was less than the traditional 0.5 for all
materials and iteration levels.  The character of a
Brownian motion is expressed and classified as either
regular or fractional, according to the value of the
Hurst exponent.  The conventional diffusion is
associated with a regular Brownian motion if H ? 0.5
and as a fractional Brownian motion if 0 &amp;lt;H ? 0.5 &amp;lt;1

Figure 8. Sorptivity parameter estimated with the
time exponent also estimated by regression at
each iteration level for clay and loam materials.

(Guerrini &amp;amp; Swartzendruber, 1994).  According to the
results of this study, the Brownian motion process in
“early-time” water infiltration in soil can be classified
as fractional, since H &amp;lt;0.5.

CONCLUSIONS

Hydrus 2D adequately simulated the “early-time”
infiltration process for pure clay and pure loam and
clay and loam materials mixed in different proportions
following the horizontal distribution of a Cantor Bar
with fractal dimension D ? 0.63.  Soil sorptivity
increased as the loam content increased in the
columns.  This behavior was attributed to the
dependence of the sorptivity parameter on capillary
radius.  The time exponent parameter estimated by
nonlinear regression was found to be less than the
traditional value of 0.5.  The fractal dimension
estimated from the Hurst exponent was 17.5 % lower
than the fractal dimension of the Cantor Bar used to
generate the columns.  Since the value of H was
different from 0.5, the water diffusion process within
the columns was characterized as fractional Brownian
motion.
