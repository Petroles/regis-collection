Abstract 

Headland sediment bypassing (HSB) processes play an important role in the definition of the 

littoral sediment budget, having particular relevance on headland-bay coasts. However, HSB has 

received little attention compared to other topics of headland-bay beach research, such as the 

beach planform rotation and stability. Thus, the main goal of this thesis was to increase the 

knowledge on HSB and recognize its role on the sediment budget of headland-bay beaches. 

The study was carried out in a 100 km rocky coastal stretch located at the Portuguese western 

coast, between the Carvoeiro and Raso capes, where numerous headland-bay beaches develops 

in a wide range of different geomorphological settings. 

To achieve the proposed goals, the work was supported by several complementary approaches 

that gave insights on the processes that constrain headland-bay beaches evolution at a wide 

range of spatial and temporal scales. These approaches included: (1) detailed morphological and 

sedimentological analysis of the beaches and inner continental shelf; (2) the study of the 

longshore drift based on a fluorescent tracer experiment (short-term approach) and empirical 

modelling (long-term approach); (3) the development and application of a new shoreline 

evolution model (SEM-PLAT) that simulate shoreline changes on beaches develop over a rocky 

shore platform; and (4) the analysis of the sediment sources and sinks along the studied coastal 

stretch and study of long-term evolution trends. 

The results obtained allowed to classify dominant HSB processes in two main modes, which are 

in line with two of the existing conceptual models. The processes were classified according to 

the prevailing domain where sediment bypass the headlands as: (1) beach headland sediment 

bypassing (BSB) – a process that takes place at the subaerial section of the beach, and (2) inner 

shelf headland sediment bypassing (SSB) – a process that occurs on the submarine domain. BSB 

process is triggered by the persistence of incoming wave direction, inducing beach rotation that, 

especially in low-degree embayments, can result in a continuous inner sandbar along the 

headland coast, which migrates downdrift and welds to the downdrift beach. This process is 

dominated by the longshore drift, occurring mainly in the intertidal zone and, eventually, in very

shallow depths of the submarine domain. SSB process, on the other hand, is triggered by high-

energy wave conditions. Under these conditions, the strong offshore currents can transport 

sediment outside the embayments. The sediment that is pushed offshore is distributed on the 

inner shelf and eventually transported alongshore, bypassing the headlands. When wave energy 

start to reduce, the sediment is slowly transported onshore and start to weld to the downdrift 

beaches. This process depends on both cross- and longshore transport components and can 

occur in both low- and high-indented beaches. 

The results also showed that HSB is a selective process. Coarser particles such gravel and very 

coarse sand tend to be trapped inside the embayments, being their bypass very low or negligible. 

Coarse sand bypass occurs mainly in the subaerial beach, except during major storm events, 

when the wave energy triggers an extreme efficient selective process, transporting the lighter 

sediment particles offshore (including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral placer deposits. 

This selective process can generate large placer deposits (e.g. Grande beach) due to a long-term 

enrichment in heavy mineral particles. In the case of medium sand particles, headland bypass 

can occur either subaerial beach or inner shelf domain, depend on the wave energy; while fine 

sand bypass occur mainly at the inner shelf. 

This work also allowed to have a better understanding of the coastal dynamics of the target 

coastal stretch.  The sediment transport patterns suggest that the studied coast is segmented in 

four sediment sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consolação; (2) Consolação-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-

Roca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The first sub-cell have particular characteristics due to the shelter 

promoted by the Peniche peninsula to the NW dominant waves and corresponds to a small 

closed system. The sub-cells (2) to (4) are macro scale embayments that are connected and have 

a similar sedimentary dynamics. The northern sectors of these embayments have a NW-SE or 

N- S general orientation and net longshore drift is southward for both winter and summer wave 

conditions. Thus, within these sectors, HSB occurs always southward, independently of the HSB 

process. The southern sectors, on the other hand, have a NE-SW general orientation and net 

longshore drift is southward, in the summer, and northward, in the winter. In these sectors, HSB 

occur mainly through the BSB, during summer, induced by the higher persistence of NW waves. 

While in winter, occur preferable through the SSB due to the increase of wave energy and 

considering that, BSB northward is unlikely due to the larger distances between the shoreline 

(beach berm) and the tip of the headlands and the lower persistence of W and SW waves. The 

balance between the longshore transport components within the southern sectors of the macro 

scale embayments, results in a sediment recirculation, which explains the sandier nature of inner 

shelf in these sectors compared to the northern ones. This also suggest that sediment can have

a relatively long residence time inside these sub-cells. However, once sediment cross the sub-

cell boundaries cannot return, because at the downdrift side the net longshore drift is 

permanently southward (gated boundaries). The frequency of the sediment linkage between 

these sub-cells depends on the seasonal and interannual wave climate variability; while the 

magnitude depends on the balance between the sediment sources and sinks of each sub-cell 

and was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1. 

The sediment budget and beach long-term evolution study, indicate that the studied littoral is 

in equilibrium with present-day conditions. However, SEM-PLAT model results showed that 

seasonal (and interannual) changes in the incident wave climate can significantly affect the 

beach configuration or even its development, putting in evidence the delicate dynamic 

equilibrium of these beaches. This delicate equilibrium and the linkage of the beaches through 

the HSB processes, suggests that climate changes can have strong impacts on their evolution.

Resumo 

O conhecimento dos processos de transposição sedimentar de promontórios (TSP) é 

fundamental para definir o balanço sedimentar das células litorais, sendo particularmente 

relevante nos sistemas de praia em enseadas, típicos de costas rochosas. No entanto, o estudo 

das praias em enseada têm sido essencialmente focado na investigação da rotação e da 

configuração de equilíbrio da sua forma planar, uma vez que, estas praias são habitualmente 

consideradas como sistemas relativamente fechados. Comparativamente, pouco se tem 

investido na compreensão dos processos de TSP. Assim, o principal objetivo desta tese foi 

contribuir para o conhecimento dos processos de TSP e perceber a sua influência no balanço 

sedimentar das praias em enseada. 

O estudo foi desenvolvido num troço litoral com cerca de 100 km de extensão, localizado na 

costa ocidental portuguesa, entre o cabo Carvoeiro e o cabo Raso. Este troço é particularmente 

rochoso, inclui promontórios de várias dimensões e acomoda um conjunto de praias com 

diferente comprimento, orientação, grau de encaixe e exposição à agitação marítima dominante 

de noroeste.  

Para alcançar os objetivos propostos, o trabalho foi suportado por várias abordagens 

complementares que permitiram estudar os processos que condicionam a evolução das praias 

em enseada, a diferentes escalas espaciais e temporais. As aproximações utilizadas foram: (1) a 

análise morfológica e sedimentológica das praias e da plataforma continental interna; (2) o 

estudo da deriva litoral através de uma aproximação de curto prazo, baseada numa experiência 

de traçadores fluorescentes, e uma aproximação de longo prazo, baseada em taxas de 

transporte sedimentar potencial estimadas a partir de formulações empíricas; (3) o 

desenvolvimento e aplicação de um modelo de evolução de linha de costa – o modelo 

SEM- PLAT, que simula a evolução da linha de costa em praias que se desenvolvem sobre 

plataformas rochosas; e por último, (4) a análise das fontes e sumidouros sedimentares ao longo 

da costa em estudo e, das tendências de evolução a longo prazo das praias.

Os resultados obtidos sugerem a existência de dois processos de TSP dominantes que estão em 

linha com dois dos modelos conceptuais existentes. Estes processos foram classificados de 

acordo com o domínio onde a transposição ocorre em: (1) transposição sedimentar de 

promontórios na praia - um processo que ocorre essencialmente na praia subaérea, e 

transposição sedimentar de promontórios na plataforma continental interna - um processo que 

ocorre no domínio submarino. O processo de transposição na praia é desencadeado pela 

persistência da direção de onda incidente, induzindo a rotação das praias que, em enseadas com 

baixa indentação, pode resultar numa barra arenosa interna, contínua, que atravessa a costa do 

promontório, migrando e soldando-se com a praia a sotamar. Este processo é dominado pela 

deriva litoral, ocorrendo principalmente na zona intertidal e, eventualmente, nas zonas menos 

profundas da praia submarina. A transposição na plataforma interna, por outro lado, é 

desencadeada por condições de agitação marítima de elevada energia. Nessas condições, as 

intensas correntes em direção ao largo, podem transportar sedimentos para fora das enseadas. 

Esse sedimento é distribuído na plataforma interna e, eventualmente, transportado 

longilitoralmente, transpondo os promontórios. Quando a energia das ondas começa a diminuir, 

o sedimento é transportado lentamente em direção à costa, alimentado as praias a sotamar. 

Este processo depende de ambas as componentes de transporte (transversal e longilitoral) e 

pode ocorrer em praias com baixo ou elevado grau de encaixe. 

Os resultados também mostraram que a transposição é um processo seletivo. As partículas mais 

grosseiras, como o cascalho e a areia muito grosseira, tendem a ficar retidas nas enseadas, sendo 

a transposição destas partículas negligível ou de baixa magnitude. No caso das areias grosseiras, 

a transposição ocorre essencialmente na praia subaérea, exceto durante tempestades extremas, 

quando a energia das ondas desencadeia um processo extremamente seletivo, que transporta 

a partículas mais leve para o largo (incluindo as areias mais grosseiras), originando depósitos de 

placer. Em algumas praias (e.g. praia Grande) estes depósitos de placer podem apresentar uma 

dimensão considerável devido a um processo cumulativo de longo prazo de partículas de 

minerais pesados. A transposição de areias médias pode ocorrer em ambos os domínios, isto é, 

na praia subaérea e na plataforma interna, dependo da energia das ondas; enquanto a 

transposição de areias finas ocorre essencialmente em domínio de plataforma interna. 

Os resultados obtidos no âmbito deste trabalho permitiram também uma melhor compreensão 

da dinâmica sedimentar do troço costeiro em estudo. Os padrões de deriva litoral ao longo da 

costa sugerem que esta se encontra segmentada em quatro sub-células sedimentares: (1) 

Carvoeiro-Consolação; (2) Consolação-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-Roca; E (4) Roca-Raso. A 

primeira sub-célula corresponde a uma pequena enseada com características particulares 



Resumo 

 

xi 

devido ao abrigo gerado pela península de Peniche às ondas dominantes de noroeste e, 

corresponde a um pequeno sistema fechado. As sub-células (2) a (4) constituem três enseadas 

de macro escala que se encontram conectadas e apresentam uma dinâmica sedimentar 

semelhante. Os setores norte destas sub-células têm uma orientação geral NO-SE ou N-S e uma 

deriva litoral residual dirigida para sul, quer para as condições de agitação marítima de verão, 

quer de inverno. Assim, nestes setores, a transposição é unidirecional (para sul), 

independentemente do processo de transposição. Nos setores sul, a orientação geral da costa 

é NE-SO e a deriva litoral residual é dirigida para sul, no verão, e para norte, no inverno. No 

verão a transposição ocorre através do processo de transposição na praia subaérea, devido à 

maior persistência de ondas vindas de noroeste; enquanto no inverno, deverá ocorrer 

essencialmente através do processo de transposição na plataforma interna, devido ao aumento 

de energia do clima de agitação marítima. No inverno, o processo de transposição na praia 

dirigido para norte, é pouco provável tendo em conta as maiores distâncias entre a linha de 

costa (neste caso, a crista da berma) e a ponta dos promontórios e, também, porque as 

condições de agitação marítima de oeste e sudoeste são menos persistentes. O equilíbrio entre 

as componentes norte e sul do transporte longilitoral, nos sectores sul destas sub-células, 

origina uma recirculação de sedimentos que explica a natureza arenosa da plataforma interna 

nesses setores, em oposição aos sectores norte mais rochosos. Este facto sugere que o 

sedimento pode ter um tempo de permanência relativamente longo dentro das sub-células. No 

entanto, quando o sedimento transpõem as fronteiras das sub-células, não pode reverter o seu 

movimento porque no lado sotamar a deriva litoral residual é permanentemente dirigida para 

sul. A frequência da ligação sedimentar entre as sub-células, depende da variabilidade sazonal 

e interanual do clima de agitação marítima. A magnitude, por outro lado, depende do balanço 

entre as fontes e sumidouros sedimentares de cada sub-célula e foi estimada na ordem de 

104  m3.ano-1. 

O balanço sedimentar e o estudo da evolução de longo prazo das praias, indicam que o litoral 

estudado está em equilíbrio com as condições atuais. No entanto, os resultados do modelo 

SEM- PLAT mostraram que variações sazonais (e interanuais) no clima de agitação marítima 

podem afetar significativamente a sua configuração, colocando em evidência o equilíbrio 

dinâmico delicado destas praias. Este equilíbrio delicado e a ligação das praias através do 

processos de transposição sedimentar, sugerem que alterações climáticas podem ter impactos 

significativos na sua evolução.

General Introduction 

 THESIS MOTIVATION 

Headland sediment bypassing (HSB) plays an important role in the definition of coastal sediment 

budget, having particular relevance in headland-bay coasts. However, headland-bay beaches 

research is usually focused on beach planform rotation and stability  (e.g. Yasso, 1965; Silvester 

and Ho, 1972; Hsu et al., 1989; Moreno and Kraus 1999; Klein et al., 2002; Bowman et al., 2009; 

Iglesias et al., 2009;  Silveira et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2010; Oliveira and Barreiro, 2010; 

Harley  et al., 2011; Short et al., 2014; Daly et al., 2015), since these beaches are generally 

regarded as fairly closed systems. On the other hand, sediment bypassing have been extensively 

studied in the context of tidal inlets and harbours, due to navigation safety issues and to solve 

downdrift erosion problems induced by the channels dredging and jetties implementation. 

Examples of these studies are Fitzgerald (1982), Sexton and Hayes (1982), Bruun and 

Willekes  (1992), Fitzgerald et al. (2000), Kraus (2000), Walton (2005), Mariani et al., 2010, 

Acworth and Lawson (2011), but many others can be found in the compilation report provided 

by Boswood and Murray (2001). Furthermore, despite the several references to the natural HSB 

found in literature, as will be seen below, few are those that focus on a detail description and 

conceptualization of the these processes. For these reasons and taking into account that 51 % 

of the world’s coast consists of mountainous or hilly coastline (Inman and Nordstrom, 1971), 

where embayed beaches tend to occur, the study of HSB processes continues to be a challenge.

 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

This thesis aimed to improve the current understanding of HSB through the identification and 

the description of controlling processes. To achieve this goal a rocky coastal stretch that hosts 

several headland-bay beaches, located at the Portuguese western coast, was chosen as case 

study. Depth, direction, frequency, magnitude and sediment characteristics of the HSB were 

investigated, as well as their relationship. Moreover, this work also intended to define the 

sediment budget and to understand the implications of the HSB in the sedimentary dynamics of 

the studied coastal stretch. The results obtained were synthetized through conceptual models 

of both HSB processes and sedimentary dynamics of the study site. 

 THESIS OUTLINE 

In order to achieve the proposed objectives this study covered a wide range of topics, including 

morphological, sedimentological and oceanographic data analyses, a tracer experiment and 

processes modelling, and was structured in eight chapters: 

Chapter 1 provides a general introduction that includes the thesis motivation, objectives and 

outline, as well as an overview about HSB processes and the general settings of the study site. 

Chapter 2 presents a geomorphological and sedimentological characterization of the inner 

continental shelf based on bathymetric LiDAR and side-scan sonar surveys, satellite images, 

orthophotomaps, sediment samples and on the sedimentological map of Portuguese 

continental shelf.  

Chapter 3 characterizes the beach morphology and its relation with the incident wave 

conditions. Beach morphodynamics is characterized through a beach planform analysis, based 

on orthophotomaps and satellite images, and a cross-shore morphological analysis, based on 

topographic data. 

Chapter 4 includes the sedimentological characterization of the studied beaches based on 

sediment grain-size and compositional analyses.  

Chapter 5 analysis longshore sediment transport patterns using a short-term approach, based 

on a fluorescent tracer experiment, and a long-term approach, based on the potential longshore 

transport estimated with empirical formulas and a wave time-series. 

Chapter 6 includes the description and application of a new shoreline evolution model – 

SEM- PLAT, developed to simulate shoreline changes on coastal stretches where beaches 

develop over a rocky shore platform.

Chapter 7 defines the sediment budget of the study site, based on the: (i) literature review about 

sediment sources and sinks; (ii) new estimates of sediment supply and sediment retention 

related with the sea-level rise; (iii) beach evolution trends observed through recent and 

historical ground-photographs; and (iv) information obtained from the previous chapters. 

Chapter 8 presents a synthesis of the results obtained in the scope of this thesis and put forward 

conceptual models for HSB processes and their implications in the sedimentary dynamics of the 

study site; it also presents the general conclusions and give guidelines for further research. 

 OVERVIEW OF HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING 

Headlands can be described as a piece of land with steep cliff face, jutting out from the coast 

into a large body of water (Neuendorf et al., 2005). These landforms can act as obstacles to the 

longshore sediment transport dividing the coast into littoral cells, which are compartments 

where sediment transport is relatively self-contain. However, depending on the headland size 

and morphology (George et al., 2015), on sediment availability and on sediment transport 

mechanisms, HSB can occurred at different depths, with variable magnitude and frequency. 

HSB is a process in which sediment is transported by wind or waves from the upstream side of 

a headland to the downstream side. Notwithstanding the importance of headland bypass dune 

fields in the sediment budget of some coasts (e.g. McLachlan et al., 1994; Boeyinga et al., 2010), 

the present study focuses on the HSB induce by waves. 

The HSB induced by waves has been study by some authors, such as  Short and Masselink (1999) 

that presented a conceptual model based on their observations on several relatively long 

beaches (&gt; 5 km), separated by headlands at the Australian eastern coast. The model assumes 

that longshore sand transport, perhaps assisted by beach rotation, causes a sand accumulation 

on the updrift side of the headland (Figure 1.1A). Then an apparent sub-aqueous movement of 

this sand around the headland occur; the sand manifests itself as a sub-aqueous sand wave on 

the tip and immediately downdrift of the headland (Figure 1.1B). The sand wave may then 

moves along the downdrift side of the headland as an offshore bar, a shallow attached bar or as 

an elongate spit which may impound a backing swash lagoon (Figure 1.1C). When the sand 

bar/spit is attached to the beach it usually initiates a topographically controlled rip that migrates 

in its advance, often causing severe localized beach erosion (Figure 1.1D). Finally, the sand wave 

merges with the downdrift beach causing a slight accretion (Figure 1.1E).

erosion rip; (E) merges with downdrift beach (extracted from Short and Masselink, 1999). 

Smith (2001) also presented a HSB conceptual model based on his observations at Australian 

eastern coast. According to this model, HSB manifests itself as an almost straight strand of sand 

that is initiated at the headland and ends upon the downdrift beach at, or very close to, the null 

point of the wave refraction orthogonal (Figure 1.2). The bypass strand converts the zone 

shoreward of the strand into a closed rotating cell opposite to the strand until the transport 

reaches the headland tip again. This closed transport cell contributes to the strand flow again 

and a rotary quasi-stability is attained. If this cell is sufficiently shallow, a lagoon can be observed 

in the centre cell during the very low tides. The author also notes that pure headland bypassing 

strands will only occur when the shoaling seabed is sediment rich. When the downdrift beach is 

highly curved in plan, such as many pocket beaches, without a straight beach section, it may be 

impossible the bypass strand occurrence. A similar model was earlier presented by Evans (1944), 

referring  that depending on the available sediment and strength of waves and currents, the 

sediment bypass deposit (strand) can be brought above the water and extended to downdrift 

side of the headland as a broad or narrow spit.

Storlazzi and Field (2000) studied the sediment paths on a rocky embayed stretch at the U.S.A. 

western coast, where small pocket beaches typically occur on stream mouths (Figure 1.3A). This 

study showed that at active-margin coasts, headlands can extend offshore as barriers to the 

longshore drift, and under these conditions, HSB can only occur during high-energy events. 

According to these authors, during storms, subaerial beach sediment can be eroded and carried 

offshore by either, seaward near-bed flows driven by wave- and wind-induced setup or intense 

rip currents, dispersing part of the sediment across shoreface and transporting the other part 

further offshore to the mid shelf (Figure 1.3B). After storm, smaller short-period waves obliquely 

approaching the coast can initiate alongshore currents, which can sweep the sediment 

deposited in the subaqueous bedrock ridges front of headlands, feeding the downdrift beaches 

and their adjacent subaqueous depressions (paleo-stream channels). The reconstruction of the 

pre-storm shoreface profile would then be aided by long period, low-energy swells carrying 

sediment onshore from greater depths (Figure 1.3C). A similar HSB process had been already 

hypothesized by Scholar and Griggs (1997).

(2000) for a headland-bay coast where the beaches typically occur on stream mouths: (A) pre-storm situation; 
(B) during storm; and (C) after storm. 

Barriolo et al. (2012) and Ferrari et al. (2014) also reported a significant transport of gravelly 

sediment around the Punta del Maiolo headland (NW Mediterranean Sea, Italy), induced by a 

rip current. In fact, severe erosion on headland-bay beaches has been associated with the 

occurrence of large-scale topographically controlled rip currents during storm events. The 

velocities of rip currents under these conditions are higher and can carry large quantities of 

sediment to great distances from the shore and to great depths (e.g. Short, 1985; Short and 

Masselink, 1999; Smith et al., 2010; Loureiro et al., 2012). This sediment may be lost from the 

beach system to offshore, being deposited beyond the closure depth (Smith et al., 2010) or

transported alongshore to the downdrift side of the headland as explained by Storlazzi and Field 

(2000). 

Evidences of HSB have been reported in other works, Lord and Van Kerkvoort (1981), for 

example, observed a significant sediment bypassing at Diggers Headland (Australia) through a 

tracer experiment, carried out under moderate wave conditions (3-4 m). 

Hume et al. (2000) analysed sand paths around a preeminent headland (Cape Rodney, New 

Zealand) that protrudes 3-4 km into deep water, based on observational data and numerical 

modelling. The study suggest that HSB in deep water is dependent of both tide and wave 

generated currents, and that this occurs episodically during storm events. The sediment bypass 

is small and intermittent occurring as thin, discontinuous and patchy sand bodies.  

Patterson (2011) and Acworth and Lawson (2011) studied Fingal Head (Australia) sand bypass, 

based on topo-bathymetric surveys. The authors describe HSB as episodic “slugs” of sand 

(relatively large) moving around the headland, generally associated with periods of high-energy 

waves, aided by accelerated longshore currents. 

Goodwin et al. (2013) investigated the sand bypass of a preeminent headland (Cape Bayron, 

Australia) based on the historical shoreface bathymetric changes and multi-decadal wave 

climate variability. Two bypassing mechanisms were interpreted: (1) a predominantly cross-

embayment transport connecting a headland-attached sand wave and the outer bar of 

downdrift beach – like strand bypass of Smith (2001), during unimodal wave direction climate; 

and (2) a split transport between the nearshore path along the inner bar and cross-embayment 

path, during a bimodal wave direction climate. The authors conclude that the switching between 

HSB mechanisms on interannual to decadal timescales determines the geometry of the bypass 

strand with the downdrift littoral zone. 

Cascalho et al. (2014), Duarte et al. (2014), Lira and Taborda (2014) found evidences of sediment 

bypass at Nazaré headland (Portuguese western coast), based on sediment textural analysis, a 

fluorescent tracer experiment and satellite images analysis, respectively. According to these 

works, an ephemeral beach appears at the downdrift side of the headland as an attached-sand 

wave, when the updrift beach reaches its full capacity and the wave regime is low enough to 

preserve sand accumulation on that location. 

Ab Razak (2015) used numerical modelling to explore the mechanisms and processes of HSB. 

The author concluded that increasing the wave angle, wave height and sediment grain-size leads 

to the increment of sand bypassing volume; nevertheless, in all cases the process remain 

unchanged. The increasing of the wave height had limited the development of surf zone currents

in the middle of embayment by creating a large seaward flowing rip current, which enhances 

the sand transport outside the surf zone. The author also noticed that the presence of the 

headland rips currents in the model is favoured by the large wave directional spreading.  

Silva et al. (2016) studied HSB at Santa Catarina Island (Brazil), using both in situ measurements 

and numerical modelling. This study demonstrated that in higher energy beaches, sand 

bypassing is entirely subaqueous, while in lower energy beaches the sand bypassing manifest by 

periodic subaerial spit development and migration. The authors reinforce the idea that HSB, 

including links to inner shelf transport, should be considered in any study of headland-bay 

beaches. 

 REGIONAL SETTINGS OF THE STUDY SITE 

The study site is located at Portuguese west coast and encompasses the coastal stretch from 

Carvoeiro cape to Raso cape (Figure 1.4).

 Geology and geomorphology 

The studied coastal stretch extends for approximately 100 km, with orientation ranging from 

NW-SE to NE-SW, depending on the sector. The continental shelf in this sector constitutes a 

huge submarine promontory, known as Esporão da Estremadura (Vanney and Mougenot, 1981). 

The most preeminent headlands are Carvoeiro cape, Ponta da Lamporeira, Roca cape and Raso 

cape, as can be noticed by the shape of the coastline and bathymetric contours presented in 

Figure 1.4. 

The geomorphological classification presented by Marques et al. (2013), shows that about 40 % 

of this coast are beaches, most of which are hinged with cliffs (30 %) and a lesser extent backed 

by dunes (6 %) and artificial structures (4 %). The other 60 % of the coast are cliffs that plunge 

directly into the sea (11 %) or are hinged on a rocky shore platform (40 %) and, artificial 

structures in contact with the sea or a rocky shore platform (9 %) (Figure 1.5).  

The studied beaches are predominantly sandy and exhibit different geometries, some present a 

high degree of embayment, while others correspond to a narrow and elongated thin sand strip 

that covers a rocky shore platform. Several beaches developed in the dependence of small fluvial 

streams, some of them with an intermittent outflow regime (Figure 1.5). These beaches result 

from the sedimentary infill that occurred on the Portuguese coast after mid Holocene (ca. 5000 

BP), in association with the stabilization of the sea-level, and was later increased by the 

anthropic activities such deforestation and agriculture (Dias et al., 2000; Freitas et al., 2002). 

Currently, the littoral sediment supply from fluvial streams have a modest magnitude in the 

order of 104 m3.yr-1 (Lira et al., 2013).

The drainage network has a dendritic pattern (Figure 1.4) and develops on a Meso-cenozoic 

sedimentary sequence, except in southern sector, where the Mesozoic formations are cut by 

the Sintra Igneous Complex and the Lisbon Volcanic Complex (Figure 1.6). According to the 

explanatory notes of the Geologic Map of Portugal at 1:50 000 scale (Zbyszewski et al., 1955; 

França et al., 1960; França et al., 1961; Zbyszewski and Assunção, 1965; Zbyszewski et al., 1966; 

Ramalho et al., 1993; Ramalho et al., 2001): 

? Meso-cenozoic sequence includes Jurassic and Cretaceous formations composed of 

alternating limestones, marls, sandstones, conglomerates and mudstones; Eocene-

Oligocene conglomerates, sands and clays with some intercalations of marls and 

limestones; Miocene lacustrine limestones (without cartographic expression in the 

Figure 1.6); Pliocene sands and clays; Pleistocene sandy and gravelly beaches and fluvial 

terrace deposits and, small outcrops of consolidate dunes; Holocene alluvial deposits, 

dunes and beach sands.  

? Sintra Igneous Complex (82-95 Ma) is an intrusive mass body, mainly formed by syenites 

and granites, although it is possible to find gabbro-diorite and igneous breccia. Lisbon 

Volcanic Complex (70-72 Ma) is mainly composed by basalt, occurring in the form of 

vents, lavas, dikes and sills. Other igneous rocks associated with the earlier rifting phases 

of the North Atlantic Ocean, outcrop as veins of dolerite and teschenit among others. 

Associated with the intrusion of igneous rocks, some contact metamorphic rocks also 

occur. 

The geology of the shallower continental shelf is an extension the emerged geologic formations 

and structures. The inner shelf sector (up to 30-40 m depth) is composed by Jurassic and 

Cretaceous sedimentary formations, except in front of the Roca Cape, in relation to the 

underwater extension of the Sintra Igneous Complex (Figure 1.6). This bedrock is partially 

covered by unconsolidated deposits, mainly composed by gravelly, coarse, medium and fine 

sand (IH, 2010).

 Climatic and oceanographic settings 

The climatic characterization of the Portuguese mainland is synthetized in Miranda et al. (2002), 

ADAPT (2015) and IPMA (2015). According to the information provided by these works, the 

climate of the study area (i.e. between the coastline and the inland limit of the watersheds) is 

characterized by moderate temperatures with dry warm summer (Köppen-Geiger classification). 

The mean annual air temperature ranging between 13 and 18 ?C; and the mean annual 

accumulated precipitation increases from the coast to inland and do not exceed the 1000 mm. 

The study coast has a semidiurnal mesotidal regime, with a spring tidal range averaging 

2.8- 2.9 m (Andrade et al., 2002), and is exposed to swells generated in the North Atlantic. 

According to the 56-years hindcast wave time-series obtained by Dodet et al. (2010), using a 

spectral wave model forced with reanalysis wind field and validated with buoy data, the 

dominant wave regime for the Portuguese west coast comes from NW. The W and SW waves 

have lower frequencies and are typical of winter and autumn seasons (Figure 1.7). The average 

offshore wave conditions are characterized by a significant wave height of 2 m, a peak period of 

11 s and a direction of 308?.  

The summer directional spreading is particularly small compared to the other seasons, as result 

of the persistence of the NW waves (Figure 1.7). Summer/spring (April to September) wave 

climate is characterized by a mean significant height of 1.5 m, a mean peak period of 9 s and a 

mean wave peak direction of 311?. In the winter/autumn (October to March), wave climate is 

quite energetic, being characterized by a mean significant height of 2.5 m, a mean peak period 

of 12 s and a mean wave peak direction of 306?; although maximum wave heights of 13 m and 

peak periods of 23 s, can be reached (Figure 1.8). According to the buoy data analysis performed 

by Costa and Esteves (2009), the most frequent storm conditions at the Portuguese western 

coast, come from WNW and NW with maximum significant wave heights between 4 and 6 m 

and a duration usually less than two days. However, extreme cases can exceed 8 m and extend 

for longer times.

Inner Continental Shelf 
Geomorphology and Sedimentology 

 INTRODUCTION 

Previous works have shown that headland sediment bypassing (HSB) can occur in association 

with submarine sediment transport, along a transition region between littoral and continental 

shelf environments (e.g. Hume et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2016). However, terminology and limits 

of this region are not a consensual matter. Wright (1987) and Wright (1993), for example, define 

inner shelf or shoreface as the region immediately seaward the surf zone where waves agitate 

the seabed. Smith (1995) also consider inner shelf and shoreface terms as being synonymous, 

but define it as the region extending from the seaward edge of the surf zone to the closure 

depth1. Notwithstanding, Niedoroda and Swift (1981) and Niedoroda et al. (1985), had 

previously used the shoreface term to define the region between the surf zone and the inner 

shelf, considering that shoreface blends into inner shelf when the slope of the seabed reach 

values on the order of 1:2000. Cowell et al. (1999), on the other hand, define shoreface as the 

                                                           

1 Closure depth is defined, for a given or characteristic time interval, as “the most Iandward depth seaward of which 
there is no significant change in bottom elevation and no significant net sediment transport between the nearshore 
and the offshore” (Kraus et al., 1998).

wave-dominated region, i.e. the region that extends from the limit of wave run-up on the beach 

face, seaward to the limit of effective influence by gravity waves in shaping seabed morphology. 

In the present work, inner shelf term was adopted to define the subtidal zone where waves can 

affect seabed. Thus, the landward limit of the inner shelf was defined based on lowest water 

level (LWL), i.e. the hydrographic zero2 (ZH). Definition of the seaward limit, however, is more 

complex and may be based on oceanographic, morphological and sedimentological criteria, i.e 

the depth corresponding to a wave base3, a slope break on the seafloor or to the offshore limit 

of the recent littoral sand deposits. Nevertheless, considering the main goal of the present work, 

the use of the sedimentological criteria seems the most appropriate, as it reflects the sediment 

transport conditions. 

Despite the poor sediment cover and irregularity of the sediment deposits of the continental 

shelf in the studied sector, the sedimentological map (IH, 2010), shows that the offshore limit of 

the littoral sands deposits, occur in general, close to 40 m depth; the only observed exception is 

in stretch between Ericeira and Roca cape, where littoral sand extends up to 90/100 m depth, 

probably due to a local structure or phenomena. The limit of the littoral sand deposits are in 

agreement with the slope breaks identified by Badagola (2008), in his morphological analysis of 

the continental shelf in this sector. Despite the local variations, the limit identified at 30/40 m 

depth seems consistent, considering other studies carried out in this and other sectors of the 

Portuguese western continental shelf (e.g. Dias, 1987; Taborda, 1999; Balsinha, 2008). 

Taking into account the previous considerations, it was assumed that inner shelf under analysis 

is located between LWL (2 m depth relative to the mean sea-level - MSL) and the depth that 

usually represent the offshore limit of recent littoral deposits (40 m depth relative to the MSL). 

The inner shelf was divided into two domains, the upper domain that extends from LWL to the 

closure depth, and the lower domain lying between the closure depth and 40 m depth (Figure 

2.1). Since there are no data or previous works regarding the accurate closure depth for the 

study site, the value estimated by Lapa et al. (2012), for the littoral north of Carvoeiro cape, 

were considered valid for this work. According to these authors, closure depth range between 

11 m and 16 m depth (MSL), with a mean value of 14 m (MSL).  

                                                           

2 Is a nautical chart datum defined based on the Lowest Astronomical Tide Level that for the Portuguese main land is 
located 2 m below the mean sea level (according to information provided by Instituto Hidrográfico, available online 
at: http://www.hidrografico.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). 

3 Is the depth beyond which “wave action ceases to stir the sediments” (Baker et al., 1966), corresponding about half

The main goal of this chapter was to investigate the possible sediment pathways and 

geomorphological constrains to sediment transport on the inner continental shelf. To achieve 

this goal a geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of the inner shelf was performed 

based on bathymetric LiDAR, sedimentological data (mapping and samples), side-scan sonar 

survey, satellite images and orthophotomaps. 

 METHODS 

 LiDAR data analysis  

Bathymetric LiDAR data were acquired between June 22nd and August 19th 2011, with a spatial 

resolution of 2 m (Silva et al., 2012b). These data were validated by Instituto Hidrográfico (Moura 

et al., 2014) and provided by Direção-Geral do Território - DGT.  

The depth range surveyed by LiDAR is not uniform, hence the morphological analysis was 

performed using a depth range well represented along the studied littoral, i.e. between -2 m 

and -10 m (MSL), covering a large part of the upper inner shelf. From the digital terrain model 

obtained, 71 profiles orthogonal to the depth contour lines were extracted, with a spacing of 

about 1 km (along N-S direction). The small stretches front of Carvoeiro and north of Magoito, 

were not characterized through this analysis, because LiDAR survey did not cover the area 

deeper than the -10 m contour line.

Width, mean slope and roughness of each profile were computed. The roughness was estimated 

using the root mean square relative to a smoothed profile (computed through a moving average 

window of 10 m) according to the expression:  

 ???? = ?
? (?? ? ????)

2?
?=1

?
 (2.1) 

where ?? is the observed elevation, ???? is the moving average elevation and ? is the number of 

observations. 

Additionally, a detail morphological description of the inner shelf fronting most prominent 

headlands (Carvoeiro, Lamporeira, Roca and Raso) was also held, based on total depth range 

obtained from LiDAR survey. 

 Sedimentological data analysis  

Sedimentological analysis was based on sedimentological map of the Portuguese continental 

shelf IH (2010). In addition, an attempt to collect sediment samples on the upper inner shelf 

contiguous to the Roca Cape was made, during the oceanographic campaign carried out by 

Instituto Hidrográfico on May 28th 2015. However, wave conditions only allowed sediment 

sampling at the lower inner shelf. Four sediment samples were collected, with a Smith-McIntyre 

grab, between 30 and 40 m depth. 

Sediment grain-size analysis was taken by sieving method for the particles larger than 1 ? and 

by laser diffraction for particles smaller than 1 ?. Both methods were performed according to 

the internal protocols of Instituto Hidrográfico, which are based on the standards NP EN 933-1 

and ISO 13320-1. The size grade scale adopted was the Wentworth scale modified by 

Krumbein (1934) and the statistic parameters of the grain-size distributions were computed 

through the method of moments described in Boggs (1995). 

 Side-scan sonar data analysis  

Side-scan sonar data were acquired by Instituto Hidrográfico, on February 9th and 11th 2015, 

using a dynamically-focused multi-beam side-scan sonar KLEIN 5000, with a longitudinal 

resolution of 0.20 m and a pulse duration of 100 µs chirp to obtain a lateral range of 100 m. The 

survey cover an area of about 15 km2, approximately between 10 and 40 m depth, offshore the 

Sintra coast. Data processing was performed using DELPH SONAR INTERPRETATION software of 

IXBLUE; time varying gain, speed and lateral range were corrected and the water column was 

removed from the signal.

Considering that the acoustic backscatter intensity depends on seafloor properties, this was 

characterized based on the different acoustic patterns identified, assuming that hard bottoms, 

such as rocky outcrops and coarse sediment result in a strong acoustic backscatter, while the 

softer bottoms (fine sand and mud) generate a weaker acoustic return signal (e.g. Davis et al., 

1996; Collier and Brown, 2005; Hamouda et al., 2016). Moreover, height and wavelength of the 

bedforms identified, were also measured based on the acoustic shadows of these “objects”, 

using the slant range to the target object (time that the signal takes to return) and the height of 

the side-scan above the seafloor. 

 Satellite images and orthophotomaps analysis  

Landsat 8 satellite images and orthophotomaps were used to get insights on the seabed 

characteristics. The satellite images were provided by National Aeronautics and Space 

Administration - NASA and United States Geological Survey – USGS (available online at: 

http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed between Dec. 2013 and Dec. 2015), while the 

orthophotomaps can be consulted online (available online at: http://mapas.dgterritorio.pt/, 

accessed Oct. 2015). 

The image analysis was qualitative, consisting on a visual inspection to identify rocky and sandy 

bottoms and morphological features such sandbars. The latter can be directly observed or 

inferred from the breakers lines. The high frequency of Landsat 8 images allowed to characterize 

the surf zone, during low- and high-energy wave conditions, and make considerations about how 

this determines HSB processes. The orthophotomaps were used to confirm some aspects that 

cannot be clearly observed on the satellite images due to their lower resolution (30 m). 

 RESULTS 

 Inner shelf morphology 

The inner shelf up to 10 m depth has an average width of 380 m, with a standard deviation of 

127 m. The narrower stretches are located front of Ribamar and immediately south of Carvoeiro 

and Roca capes, where the width decrease down to 155 m, 84 m and 16 m, respectively. Mean 

slopes are, in general, gentle and less than 2° (92% of the observations). Steeper zones coincide 

with the narrower stretches mentioned above, reaching a maximum of 25? at Roca cape. The 

roughness varies between 0.03 and 0.18 m and its spatial distribution indicate that stretches 

north of the headlands tend to be lesser rough than southern ones. This is particularly evident 

front of prominent headlands, such as Lamporeira, Roca and Raso, although the same

morphological trend is observed at smaller headlands, such as Consolação and Peralta. 

Exceptions to this trend are Carvoeiro cape, with a high-rough shelf at both sides, and Magoito 

headland, where roughness is higher at the northern sector compared to the southern one 

(Figure 2.2).

roughness (40 m contour depth extracted from Vanney and Mougenot, 1981). 

Digital terrain models of the inner shelf in the vicinity of the most prominent headlands and 

respective cross-shore bathymetric profiles show rough surfaces (Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4). In 

the case of Carvoeiro cape, the inner shelf plunges abruptly up to 5 m depth with a mean slope 

of 11?, and then extends as a large and rough submarine plateau with a mean slope of 0.4?; 

north and south sides of this headland have a narrow and steeper upper inner shelf, reaching

23 

15 m depth at 300/400 m from the coastline. At the Lamporeira headland region the inner shelf 

is shallower, comparatively to the other headlands, plunging gently up to 6 m depth with a mean 

slope of 0.6?. On the contrary, the inner shelf offshore Roca cape is deeper, plunging up to 13 m 

depth with a mean slope of 4.8?; between 13 and 16 m depth, it becomes less steep with a mean 

slope of 1.4?; and then presents a shape almost horizontal. The inner shelf close to Raso cape, 

presents a horizontal platform around 3 m depth, becoming rougher and plunging up to 10 m 

depth with a slope of 1.3?; from 10 to 17 m depth, mean slope increases to 6.9?, and then 

presents a surface approximately horizontal.

 Inner shelf sedimentology 

The sedimentary deposits covering the inner continental shelf are presented in Figure 2.5. Only 

52 % of the studied inner shelf is covered by unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, the 

other 48 % are rocky outcrops, which are preferably located offshore of prominent headlands. 

Between Carvoeiro and Peralta headlands, the sedimentary cover is mainly composed by coarse 

sediments, such as gravels, gravelly sands and coarse sands; and some of these coarse deposits 

have an important biogenic component. South of Peralta the sedimentary deposits are mainly 

medium and fine sands, despite the existence of small stains of coarse and muddy sands. 

Medium sand deposits usually occur at depths shallower than 20 m, for greater depths fine sand 

became dominant. The stretch between Sta. Cruz and Ericeira is particularly rocky, while the 

stretch between Ericeira and Roca cape is the sandiest. 

The four sediment samples collected in the framework of this study, at the lower inner shelf 

near Roca cape, are mainly composed by fine sand (Figure 2.6), except sample S3 that 

corresponds to rock and coral fragments. The sediment collected northern of Roca cape (S1 and 

S2) have mean grain-sizes of 2.46 and 2.34 ?, and a standard deviation of  0.54 and 0.58 ?; while 

the sediment from southern side (S4) is slightly finer and less sorted, with a mean grain-size of 

2.84 ? and a standard deviation of 0.85 ?. The main differences observed between the sediment 

samples and the sedimentological map, were found at sample S3 (Figure 2.5). Still, this

difference are acceptable, considering that map results from data interpolation and the time 

interval between samplings.

during sediment sampling (without any correction) were 33, 35, 34 m for samples S1, S2 and S4, respectively. 

 Inner shelf seafloor texture and bedforms 

Side-scan sonar imagery presented in Figure 2.7, covers essentially the lower inner shelf 

offshore the coastal stretch between Magoito and Adraga. The light greys tones correspond to 

high backscatter intensity and dark greys tones to low backscatter intensity. 

Three main patterns were identified, the first one correspond to the areas with low backscatter 

intensity and smooth surfaces, typical of seafloors cover by fine sediment (Figure 2.7B). This 

pattern occupies the larger part of the surveyed area and, considering the sediment distribution 

from Figure 2.5, it corresponds to fine sand. 

The second pattern encompasses the areas with high backscatter intensity and large shadows 

indicating the high roughness of the seafloor (Figure 2.7B and Figure 2.7C). In these areas it is 

possible to observe linear features that should correspond to the stratification of a rocky 

substrate, probably from Jurassic formations (see Figure 1.6). The larger outcrop is located 

offshore Azenhas do Mar, but small outcrops can be found in the northern sector of the surveyed 

area. 

The third pattern corresponds to small patches that also present high backscatter intensity, 

morphologically smoother and presenting symmetric rhythmic forms oriented NE-SW (Figure 

2.7C and Figure 2.7D). These features indicate that this pattern corresponds to sediment 

deposits, while its high reflectivity suggest that this sediment should be coarse. The rhythmic 

bedforms of the sediment located in the cavities of the larger rocky outcrop have a mean 

wavelength of 2 m and a mean height of 0.25 m. On the other hand, the bedforms observed at

depths between 15 and 20 m have a mean wavelength of 0.80 m and a mean height of 0.12 m. 

For shallower depths, bedforms become more common but decrease in size, which makes 

measurement quite difficult.

patches of coarse sediment with bedforms contrasting with dark finer sediment (mangenta rectangle). 

 Sandbars and surf zone width 

Satellite images show well-developed sandbars along the stretches with NE-SW general 

orientation, located north of the most prominent headlands, except in the case of Carvoeiro 

cape (Figure 2.8). The projection of the bathymetric contour obtained from LiDAR data on the 

images suggest that sandbars are located mainly between 7 and 10 m depth (MSL). It can be 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

28 

noticed that the development of these sandbars is not constrained to the sectors front of the 

beaches, extending in front of the rocky sectors, where usually get closer to the coastline. 

In the case of stretches with a N-S to NW-SE general orientation, sandbar are absent and 

sometimes it is possible to observe rocky outcrops with patchy sand bodies, such as is the case 

of the inner shelf south of Consolação headland, where the stratification of the Jurassic 

formations can be noticed (Figure 2.8A). These structures, as well as the rocky seafloor offshore 

Ribarmar (Ericeira) and downdrift Raso cape, were clearly observed in the orthophotomaps. 

The analysis of the surf zone width, under different wave energy conditions, was performed in 

two coastal stretches with 9 km long. The first stretch, has a NE-SW general orientation and is 

located between Magoito and Adraga (Figure 2.9). The second stretch, is more crenulated, have 

a N-S general orientation and is located northward Ericeira, between Baleia and Calada beaches. 

As expected, under low-energy wave conditions the surf zone is narrow for both cases, being 

almost imperceptive inside the deeper embayments (Figure 2.9A and Figure 2.10A). 

The increase of the wave energy, increases the surf zone width. However, between Magoito and 

Adraga, the surf zone easier reach the tip of the headlands, extending continuously alongshore 

under both moderated and high-energy wave conditions (Figure 2.9B and Figure 2.9C); while 

between Baleia and Calada beaches, the surf zone only extend outside the embayments, during 

high-energy events (Figure 2.10B and Figure 2.10C).

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The inner continental shelf present variations in the width along the studied site, being 

particularly larger front of Carvoeiro and Lamporeira (?7 km) and narrower in the stretch 

between Magoito and Roca cape (&amp;lt;4 km), as can be seen by the location of 40 m depth 

bathymetric in the Figure 2.2. However, the morphological analysis shows that this is relatively 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

32 

uniform with respect to the width and slope up to 10 m depth. Exceptions are downdrift sides 

of some headlands, where inner shelf is narrower and steeper, being Roca cape the most 

notorious case.  

Sectors updrift the headlands typically have NE-SW orientations and lower roughness, indicating 

that these should be sandier than downdrift sectors that generally have N-S and NW-SE 

orientations and higher roughness. This is particularly evident at the most prominent headlands, 

such as Lamporeira, Roca and Raso (Figure 2.2). These results put in evidence the role of the 

aforementioned headlands in the sediment retention and are supported by the presence of well-

developed outer sandbars, as well as by the sedimentological map and side-scan data that show 

sandier seafloors updrift these headlands. 

Bathymetric profiles offshore most prominent headlands show that from the morphological 

point of view, there are conditions for inner shelf bypassing. However, bypass occurrence is also 

conditioned by sedimentary constrains. 

Sediment bypass of Carvoeiro cape seems difficult considering: (1) the rocky nature of the inner 

shelf around the headland; (2) its location at the tip of Peniche Peninsula that protrudes into the 

water 2.5 km from the adjacent sandy coastline; (3) the inexistence of sand accumulation on the 

western jetty of Peniche harbour; and (4) the differences of the inner shelf sediment grain-size 

and composition north and south of the headland. The sedimentary cover of northern inner 

shelf is mainly composed by lithoclastic fine sands, while the southern one is composed by bio-

lithoclastic coarse sands (Figure 2.5). Furthermore, longshore sediment pathway from updrift 

sector occurred in the past through what is today the Peniche isthmus (Calado, 1994). 

In the case of Lamporeira, the inner shelf is shallow and have a low slope (Figure 2.4), favouring 

sediment bypass. Offshore Roca cape, inner shelf is very steep down to 13 m depth, with slope 

decreasing seaward slope, becoming almost horizontal at 16 m depth (Figure 2.4). Under these 

conditions, the most likely is that sediment bypass occur either near the coastline or at depths 

greater than 13 m. This hypothesis is acceptable considering that the closure depth ranges from 

11 to 16 m (Lapa et al., 2012), and the bedforms present in the inner shelf updrift of Roca cape 

at these depths. These bedforms have a symmetrical rhythmic patterns, typical of oscillatory 

flows, and a NE-SW orientation, orthogonal to the NW dominant wave conditions. Considering 

the seafloor sediment cover near this headland, sediment bypassed at these depths should be 

medium to fine sand (Figure 2.5). 

Raso cape has two distinct sectors with gentle mean slopes, a first one at 3 m depth and, a 

second one that extends from 17 m depth to deeper waters. Considering the closure depth 



Inner Continental Shelf Geomorphology and Sedimentology 

 

33 

mentioned before, the first pathway is the most plausible for the sediment bypassing. However, 

the shallower sector of the inner shelf downdrift this headland, is extremely rocky (Figure 2.5). 

Orthophotomaps show that in this sector cliffs are hinged with a rocky submarine platform that 

presents a sediment cover very incipient close to the coastline. This sediment scarcity is 

observed along 7 km between the Raso cape and the Cascais bay (Figure 2.8D), where the 

coastline has a crenulated shape changing its orientation several times, favourable conditions 

for sediment deposition. However, no significant littoral sediment accumulation is observed, 

including at the Cascais marina structure built in the later 90’s. Under these conditions sediment 

bypassing of Raso cape should be negligible.  

The outer sandbars observed along the NE-SW oriented stretches, as well as the surf zone 

extension seaward the tip of the headlands, under moderate to high-energy wave conditions, 

indicate a sediment linkage of the submarine beach along these stretches. In the rockier 

stretches, located at NW-SE sectors, the coast present a more crenulated shape and the 

sediment linkage between deeper bays only seems possible during high-energy wave conditions.

Beach Morphology 

 INTRODUCTION 

Headland-bay beaches exhibit a wide range of sizes (from several tens metres to few 

kilometres), shapes and indentations. Morphological features of these beaches are distinct from 

sandy-coast beaches, because sediment transport is generally confined to the embayment. The 

three-dimensional morphology of headland-bay beaches is the result of a closely relation 

between the cross-shore morphology (profile) and alongshore morphology (planform). A 

common feature of these beaches is the asymmetric shape of the planform, which is 

characterised by a curved zone, a gentle transition and/or a relatively straight tangential 

segment on the downdrift end. Sometimes, the curved zone may not exist or the straight 

tangential section does not appear. The planform may even become symmetric between two 

headlands in identical layout (Hsu et al., 2010). The long-term equilibrium state of the beach 

planform has been extensively studied (e.g. Yasso, 1965; Silvester and Ho, 1972; Hsu et al., 1989; 

Moreno and Kraus, 1999; Klein et al., 2010; Daly et al., 2015),  as well as the short- to medium-

term beach clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation (e.g. Klein et al., 2002; Short and Trembanis, 

2004; Ranasinghe et al., 2004; Pinto et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2010; Turki et al., 2013; Harley 

et al., 2015). However, little attention has been given to the relationship between beach 

morphology and headland sediment bypassing (HSB). Thus, the main goal of this chapter was 

the description of the beach morphology along and across-shore to get insights on HSB 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

36 

processes. To achieve this goal, a characterization of the beach planform geometry along the 

entire study coast was performed based on beach length, orientation, embayment degree and 

exposure to the dominant wave regime. The planform rotation and cross-shore morphology 

were also analysed for a subset of the studied beaches and related with incident wave 

conditions. 

 METHODS 

 Wave data analysis 

For a better interpretation of the results a hindcast wave time-series was used to characterize 

the offshore wave climate between 2009 and 2015, which covers the time-interval of the 

morphological data. The wave series (kindly provided by Professor Xavier Bertin, University of 

La Rochelle) was obtained following the modelling strategy presented by Dodet et al. (2010). 

Wave significant height (??), peak period (??) and peak direction (???), obtained for a time 

interval of 6 hours, were used to characterise the seasonal and interannual wave conditions.  

 Beach planform analysis 

 Planform geometry 

Beach planform geometry analysis was performed for all the sandy stretches observed on the 

orthophotomaps acquired on June 2012 and provided Direcção-Geral do Território – DGT. The 

planform geometry can be described by a set of planform parameters (see for example Bowman 

et al., 2009). In this work the following parameters were used (Figure 3.1): 

? Length and azimuth of the straight line between headland’s tips (??); 

? Length and azimuth of the beach between headlands (?), which was assumed as the 

wet-dry line that matches the wave swash limit and typically represents berm crest 

position; 

? maximum distance between the ?? and ? lines that corresponds the bay indentation 

(?); 

? distance between the ?? and ? lines close to the headlands that limit the beach system 

(?1 and ?2). 

?? and ? lines were manually vectorized on orthophotomaps at a fixed scale (1:5000), using the 

ArcGIS v10.3 software. The ?, ?1 and ?2 distances were obtained through the orthogonal 



Beach Morphology 

 

37 

distances between ?? and ? lines, measured alongshore for a distance interval of 10 m, using 

the Digital Shoreline Analysis v4.3 software (Thieler et al., 2009). 

 

Figure 3.1. Parameters used to describe the beach planform geometry (example of Caniçal beach at 
Lourinhã). ? is the beach stretch between headlands; ?? is the straight line between headland’s tips; ? is the 
maximum distance between the ?? and ? lines; and ? is the wave crest obliquity to ?? line. 

Following previous works (e.g. Klein and Menezes, 2001; Bowman et al., 2009) beach 

embayment index was obtained from the relation: 

 ????????? ????? =
?

?? ??????
 (3.1) 

Exposure to the dominant wave conditions was obtained based on the wave crest obliquity to 

?? line (?), as illustrated in Figure 3.1. Maximum and minimum beach exposure occurs when ? 

is 0 and ?90?, respectively. Thus, exposure index was computed according to the expression:  

 ???????? ????? = 1 ? (
|?|

90
)  (3.2) 

? values were computed assuming the mean wave peak direction (307?) obtained from the 56-

years hindcast wave time-series provided by Dodet et al. (2010). 

 Planform rotation 

The analysis of beach planform evolution was performed using Landsat 8 images acquired 

between April 2013 and December 2015, with a 16 days revisit cycle. These images were 

provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA and United States Geological 

Survey – USGS Landsat program (available online at: http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed 

between Dec. 2013 and Dec. 2015). 

The beach stretches orientation was obtained based on the wet-dry line extracted from the 

satellite images according to the flowchart presented in Figure 3.2. The images were pre-

processed with the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin of QGIS software that convert Landsat 

Digital Numbers (DNs) to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance using the rescaling factors and 

parameters given in the Landsat metadata file. This image pre-processing consist in a 

radiometric correction and also included an atmospheric correction through the DOS1 method 

(Dark Object Subtraction 1). DOS is a simple atmospheric correction method that remove the 

effects of atmospheric scattering from an image by subtracting a pixel value that represents a 

background signature from each band (see details in Congedo, 2016). 

 

Figure 3.2. Flowchart of the Landsat image analisys for wet-dry line extration and results validation. 

The wet-dry line was extract automatically from the pre-processed images, using a toolbox 

created in the ArcGIS v10.3 software for this propose. This toolbox uses a Normalized 

Differences Water Index (????) to identify wet and dry areas, assuming that wet sand appears 

darker, i.e. less reflective than dry sand (Nolet et al., 2014). ???? is an arithmetic operation 

that enhances the spectral signals by contrasting the reflectance between different wavelengths

(e.g. Gao, 1996; McFeeters, 1996). In the present study ???? was computed based on the Red

 ???? =

 (3.3) 

The ???? obtained was resampled for a pixel with 5 m using the cubic method that calculates 

the value of each pixel by fitting a smooth curve based on the surrounding 16 pixels. The 

resampled image was then reclassified based on a threshold value of 0.075 to separate wet and 

dry areas. Finally, the wet-dry limit was automatically vectorised. 

The results of image analysis were validated with field data acquired at Guincho beach on 9th 

and on 16th July of 2014, at the same time of satellite image acquisition (Figure 3.2). In the first 

case, during high-tide (3.08 m - MSL), and in the second case, during low-tide (0.73 m - MSL). 

The comparison between the lines extract by image analysis and the measured ones have a root 

mean square error of 6.25 m, in the first case, and  9.75 m, in the second case, which are quite 

good considering the 30 m image pixel resolution of the Landsat 8 images. However, many of 

the studied beaches are narrow and the dry zone width is often close or within the pixel 

resolution. In this conditions the lines obtained usually correspond to the cliff’s foot, producing 

unreliable results. Thus, the beach rotation analysis was performed only for beaches that usually 

present larger dry areas. Considering this constraint, 13 beaches with different features and 

located at different coastal stretches, were chosen (Figure 3.3). Image analysis results for each 

beach were excluded when the wet-dry limit coincides the cliff foot and when clouds cover the 

area under analysis. Figure 3.4 show the image time-series used for each beach.

Most of the topographic data were acquired with a GPS-RTK, although some data of Coxos beach 

were acquired with terrestrial LiDAR (Diogo et al., 2014; Bastos et al., 2015). Based on the 

available dataset it was possible to identify and compare beach morphological features, such as 

beach face slope and berm crest height. The beach slope was estimated based on the profile 

segment between 1 and 2 m of elevation (relative to the MSL). When a considerable number of

profile surveys are available, it was possible make some considerations about the beach 

morphological changes. 

 Beach photo-monitoring 

During the field work carried out in the scope of this study, some beaches were also monitored 

using close range photography. Although the periodicity and tide level of the image acquisition 

were not systematic, this information is considered relevant to understand and illustrate some 

aspects related to the beach morphological changes. All photographs acquired were compiled 

online using the application Flickr and are available at:

illustrate changes observed in the beaches can be seen in the web addresses listed in the

 RESULTS 

 Offshore wave conditions 

Seasonal wave climate for the period under analysis (2009-2015, in Figure 3.6), agree in general, 

with wave climate presented in Chapter 1 (1953-2008, in Figure 1.7). The NW waves are 

dominant, while W and SW waves are less frequent and typical of winter/autumn seasons. The 

main differences are the higher frequency of higher waves, typical of the winter/autumn season, 

and the greater directional spreading during summer/spring seasons, related with the higher 

frequency of waves coming from NNW direction. The mean winter/autumn wave conditions 

exhibit a ?? of 2.5 m, a ?? of 12 s and a ??? of 306?, while mean summer wave conditions are 

characterized by a ?? of 1.9 m, a ?? of 10 s and a ??? of 315?.

The annual distribution of significant wave height do not show significant differences, being the 

median value of each year, approximately, 2 m. The box-plot diagrams in the Figure 3.7 indicate 

that the years of 2013 and 2014 had a slightly higher frequency of higher waves. On the other 

hand, the years of 2012 and 2015 were characterized by the lowest maximum heights. The 

annual median peak periods varied between 11 and 12 s, being the highest wave period (23 s) 

reached in 2010 and 2014.

maximum and minimum values. Data provided by professor Xavier Bertin (University of La Rochelle). 

Annual distribution of peak wave directional classes shows once again that waves coming from 

NW quadrant are dominant. The years of 2011 and 2013, were characterized by higher 

frequency of NNW waves; while the years of 2009, 2010 and 2012 had higher frequencies of 

WSW waves. The most significant percentages of SSW waves occurred in the years of 2010 and 

2015 (Figure 3.8).

 Beach planform 

 Planform geometry 

Results of planform geometry show that studied beach length varies between 25 m and 3 km. 

The longest beaches are located in the NE-SW oriented stretches, being Consolação beach, 

located at the north end of the study site, an exception. The results also show that the coastal 

stretch located between Paimôgo and Lamporeira is the sandier (Figure 3.9A). 

Beach orientation varies between the 146° and 247° azimuths and coincides, in general, with 

the general orientation of the coastal stretch where the beaches are hosted. Exceptions are the 

cases of Samarra beach, and same beaches located between São Lourenço and Foz do Lizandro, 

where the most extreme case is the Coxos beach located immediately south of São Lourenço 

(Figure 3.9B). 

The most exposed beaches (to the NW dominant wave direction) are located at the coastal 

stretches with a NE-SW orientation, while the most sheltered beaches are at the stretches with 

a NW-SE and NNW-SSE orientation (Figure 3.9C). 

Beach embayment index shows a more irregular distribution along coast. However, it can be 

noticed that the most embayed beaches occurred preferably on the most crenulated stretches, 

i.e. nearby Roca cape and Paimôgo, and between São Lourenço and Foz do Lizandro. Also worth 

mentioning the isolated cases of Porto Novo and Samarra beaches (Figure 3.10A).

Figure 3.9. Beach length (A), orientation (B) and exposure to the NW dominant waves (C).  

The distance between the berm crest and the tip of the headlands is, in general, shorter close 

to the southern limit. On the other hand, it can be also noticed that larger distances do not 

always match with higher embayments, see for example Consolação beach and Abano beach

(north of Guincho) that have a similar embayment degree, but significant differences in distance 

to the tip of the headlands (Figure 3.10B).

headlands that limit the beach (B).

48 

Considering the beach embayment degree and exposure to the dominant waves, Figure 3.11A 

show that there is no direct relation between them. The beach exposure is related with the 

beach orientation that as stated before is conditioned by the general orientation of the coast. 

However, it can be noticed that the two beaches (Samarra and Coxos) presenting ENE-WSW 

orientations, have a high-degree of embayment (see Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.9). 

On the other hand, it can be also noticed that the longest beaches (&gt; 1 km) have NE-SW and 

NNE-SSW orientations, a low-degree of embayment and a high exposure to the dominant waves 

(Figure 3.11B and Figure 3.11C). Except Consolação beach, located at the north end of the 

studied site, with a NNW-SSE orientation, a slightly higher embayment degree and a lower 

exposure. The shorter beaches have variable orientations, embayment degrees and exposures.

versus length; and (C) exposure vesrus length. Dots are projected with different colors representing beach 
orientation. 

 Planform rotation 

The results of beach planform rotation show a coherent signal in time with a range that depends, 

once again, on the orientation of the stretch where each beach is included. The northern 

beaches (Consolação to Azul – see location in Figure 3.3) have minor variations, while the 

southern beaches present larger changes, mainly in the cases of Calada, São Lourenço, Foz do

Lizandro and Maçãs beaches (Figure 3.12). In general, beaches display a clockwise rotation 

during summer that is particularly evident in August month, and a counter-clockwise rotation in 

the winter. The asymmetry of box-plots, indicate that the clockwise rotations are more deviate 

from the median orientation than the counter-clockwise rotations (Figure 3.13).

The annual analysis show that, in 2014, the range of beach rotation was larger compared to the 

other years. However, it is important to notice that the smaller range observed in 2013 can be 

related with inexistence of data for the first trimester of this year (Figure 3.14).

 Beach cross-shore morphology 

 Profile morphology 

Cross-shore morphology of the sta. Cruz beach was studied based on three profile: SCR1 at the 

northern sector, backed by a cliff; SCR2 at the central sector, backed by an artificialized dune; 

and SCR3 at the southern sector, backed by an artificial structure (Figure 3.15). During the 

monitoring period this beach often presented one or two well-developed berms with a crest 

elevation between 2.4 and 6 m. The berm was usually wider and higher in the southern sector, 

except in March/June 2011, when the northern sector presented a particularly well-developed 

berm. The seasonal variability of the beach is reflected mainly by the berm advance and retreat, 

although sometimes it was possible to observe a more dissipative morphology. The most 

notorious case occurred in March 2013, when all the beach profiles had a concave shape, typical 

of post-storm conditions. However, beach also showed a rapid recovery of its typical 

morphology in the following months. In April 2014, beach profiles showed again a considerable 

retreat and the northern and central sectors reached its minima elevation on the upper part.

Coxos beach profile is backed by a cliff and between 2011 and 2013 presented a well-developed 

berm with a crest elevation between 4 and 5.6 m. During this period, the morphological changes 

were minor and related with the berm width and elevation. However, in January 2014, the beach 

profile presented a concave shape, typical of post-storm conditions, with a lowering of the 

topographic surface of about 3.5 m in the upper part. During the eighteen months afterward, it 

can be noticed the beach did not recover its previous volume (Figure 3.16).     

 

Figure 3.16. Coxos beach profiles. 

Baleia beach is backed by an artificial structure in all its extension and showed a very stable 

behaviour during the monitoring period (Figure 3.17). The profiles showed that beach width 

increases from north (BAL1) to south (BAL2). At the northern sector, the beach was narrower 

and does not developed a berm, while the central and southern sectors exhibited a summer 

berm that was eroded in winter. Berm crest elevation reached 5 m, in the central sector, and 4 

m, in the southern sector. However, it must be acknowledged that some of the morphological 

features are artificially reworked. For example, the berm of the central sector is artificially 

constructed at the beginning of summer season, as observed during the survey of June 2014.  

Central and southern profiles showed an increasing of the elevation in the spring/summer, while 

the northern profile slightly grows in the winter, suggesting a beach rotation process. The low-

tide terrace of this beach often presented a roughness pattern related with the exposure of a 

rocky platform located just below mean sea-level.

Foz do Lizandro profiles are backed by a dune, which was partially surveyed in the northern 

sector (LIZ1). This sector showed a lowering of the beach surface of about 2.5 m and a dune 

retreat of about 20 m, between February and April 2014. Southern profile (LIZ2) also showed 

lowering of the beach surface elevation of about 3 m, between January and June 2014. However, 

in June 2014, the northern sector of the beach already showed some recovering. In February 

2015, both profiles showed an accretion with the development of two berms, in the northern 

sector, and one berm, in the southern sector, with elevations between 2.8 and 4.9 m (Figure 

3.18).  

  

Figure 3.18. Foz do Lizandro beach profiles: LIZ1 at the northern sector and LIZ 2 at the southern sector. 

Magoito beach profiles are backed by cliffs and, during the monitoring period, often showed a 

summer berm (with elevations between 2.3 and 3.5 m) that disappeared in the winter (Figure 

3.19).

56 

The high roughness observed in some profiles of Magoito beach was related with exposure of 

the rocky shore platform. Until March 2013, in the central sector (MAG2), the platform exposure 

only occurred in winter months. However, from this date onwards the rocky platform have been 

exposed or covered with a thin sandy layer on the upper part without berm development. In the 

southern sector (MAG3), it was also observed considerably retreat of the beach in March 2013. 

Despite the recovery observed by the end of the year, in January 2014 beach retreated again 

(Figure 3.19).  

Maçãs beach is backed by a dune that was surveyed during field campaigns. In October 2012, 

the beach profile presented a wide berm (?100 m) with a crest elevation of 4.5 m. At the 

beginning of 2014, a considerable beach retreat was observed with the berm obliteration, while 

dune showed a sand gain. In June 2014, dune presented a sand loss that according to the field 

observation, resulted from the artificial removal to nourish the upper beach. During the year of 

2015, the beach gradually recovered and, in September 2015, a well-developed berm with a 

crest elevation of 4 m was observed. However, the beach volume observed in 2012 was not yet 

reached (Figure 3.20).  

 

Figure 3.20. Maçãs beach profiles. 

Grande beach is backed by an artificial structure at the northern (GRA1) and central (GRA2) 

sectors, and by a cliff, at the southern sector (GRA3). This beach show an overall accretionary 

trend between February 2014 and September 2015. In the summer period, presented a well-

developed berm with elevations between 2 and 4.4 m; while in the winter, the berm was 

obliterated and the subaerial beach was represented by a flat beach face. The beach profiles 

acquired in September 2014 showed that the north and south sections of the beach

experimented an opposite behaviour (accretion of the northern sector and erosion of the central 

and southern sectors) related with the beach planform rotation process (Figure 3.21).

Adraga beach profile, located in a stream mouth, showed an accretive trend during the 

monitoring period, presenting in all dates a well-developed berm with elevations ranging from 

2.3 to 4.4 m (Figure 3.22). 

 

Figure 3.22. Adraga beach profiles. 

Guincho beach is backed by dunes. In December 2009, this beach presented a typical winter 

morphology without berms. Three months later, the northern sector (GUI1) showed the same 

morphology, while the southern sector (GUI2) had experiment a significant erosion. In July 2014, 

beach presented a well-developed berm with an elevation of 2.7 m, in the northern sector, and 

3.5 m, in the southern sector. However, beach surface was, in general, lower than the one 

observed four years before. In November 2015, beach showed an accretion with berm advance, 

in the northern sector, and the increase of the berm elevation and the development of a second 

berm, in the southern sector (Figure 3.23). 

Figure 3.24 show the topographic profiles of several beaches: Azul (AZU), backed by dunes; Baío 

(BAI) and Pequena (PEQ), backed by cliffs; and São Lourenço (SLO) and Algodio (ALG), backed by 

artificial structures. The data acquired in February 2015 showed that São Lourenço and Agodio 

presented berms with crest elevations of 6 and 3.5 m, respectively; while Baío, Azul and Pequena 

beaches had flat shapes. The comparison of the topographic surveys performed in the summer 

of 2014 and winter of 2015, showed minor variations at São Lourenço beach, related with a 

slight erosion of the beach face and accretion of the berm. In the case of Pequena, beach surface 

presented higher elevations in the winter than in the summer. 

The general aspect of the beaches, as well as some of the morphological aspect described above, 

can be seen through the beach photo-monitoring program (see Appendix A).

 Beach face slope and berm crest elevation 

Mean beach face slope and maximum berm crest elevation observed in each beach were 

compared in Figure 3.25. In the case of the beaches where more than one profiles were 

monitored, average values are assumed. Beach face slope ranges between 4? and 9?, being 

possible to noticed that beaches located north of Foz do Lizandro (LIZ) tend to have higher 

slopes, indicating that these are more reflective than the southern ones (Figure 3.25A). Berm 

crest elevation ranges between 3.6 m and 6 m relative to the MSL. The higher berm elevation 

correspond to the high-indented beaches of São Lourenço (SLO) and Coxos (COX), but any trend 

alongshore can be noticed (Figure 3.25B).

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The analysis of beach planform show that the longest and most exposed beaches are, in general, 

in the stretches with a NE-SW general orientation, being the sector between Paimôgo and 

Lamporeira the sandier. On the other hand, in the stretches with N-S and NW-SE general 

orientation, beaches tend to be shorter and less exposed to the dominant waves. Consolação 

beach is the exception to this trend, due to the sheltering effect of Peniche peninsula; it is the 

longest beach of the studied coast and is located in a NW-SE oriented stretch (Figure 3.9 and 

Figure 3.11). 

Beach orientation is, in general, similar to the general orientation of the coastal sectors where 

they are included. The most notorious exceptions are Samarra and Coxos beaches, which have 

an ENE-WSW orientation and a high-degree of embayment related with the local 

geomorphology. Both beaches developed on narrow indentations with an alignment NNW-SSE 

and NW-SE, respectively (Figure 3.26). 

Beach embayment degree is conditioned by coastal geomorphology and do not have a direct 

relation with the others planform parameters (Figure 3.11).

Planform rotation analysis show that beaches displays, in general, a clockwise rotation during 

summer (Figure 3.13), which can be related to the NW (less energetic) incident wave conditions. 

The persistence of these conditions induces an enlargement of the beach downdrift (southward) 

(Figure 3.27). This process can result in HSB through a continuous inner sandbar along the 

headland coast, which migrates downdrift in the surf zone and weld to the downdrift beach, as 

it can be seen in the example of the Figure 3.28A. In the winter, a counter-clockwise rotation is 

observed (Figure 3.28B). However, considering the wider distances observed between the beach 

berm and the northern headlands compared to the southern ones (Figure 3.10), and the less 

persistent W and SW incident wave conditions, HSB related with the beach rotation during 

winter, seems more unlikely. 

 

Figure 3.27. Aspect of the Grande beach: (A) on 10th April 2014 (tidal level = 0.56 m MSL) and (B) on 31st 
August 2014 (tidal level = -0.66 m MSL). Tide levels were computed based on Cascais tide gauge data using 
the UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011).

Figure 3.28. Aspect of the coastal strechet between Maçãs and Adraga beaches: (A) on August 23rd and (B) on 
December 20th  2013 (Landsat 8 images provided by NASA and USGS). Tide levels for the time of the image 
acquisition were computed based of Cascais tide gauge data using the UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011). The mean 
offshore wave conditions (??, ?? and ???) for the 12 hours before the image acquisition,  were obtained 
from the wave time-series numerically modeled, provided by Professor Xavier Bertin, University of La 
Rochelle. 

Analysis of beach planform rotation also indicate that the beaches located north of Lamporeira 

headland have minor variations, while the southern beaches present larger rotations (Figure 

3.12). However, in the case of Maçãs beach, the rotation seems abnormally high, being probably 

amplified by the influence of the Colares fluvial stream mouth on the shoreline orientation of 

this short beach. 

Beach rotation increases with the decrease of the beach length (Figure 3.29), but is poor related 

with beach embayment (Figure 3.30) or exposure to the dominant waves (Figure 3.31). Thus, 

the differences between the beaches located north and south of Lamporeira headland, can only 

be explained by a faster response of the shorter beaches to the incident wave conditions 

compare to the longer ones. Despite the poor correlation between beach rotation and 

embayment degree, Figure 3.11 shows that longer beaches (&gt;1 km), have low-degree of 

embayment, being the case of all beaches located north of Lamporeira for which planform 

rotation was studied. The low-degree of embayment of these beaches can justify their small 

rotation given that retention capacity of the headlands is smaller. Under these conditions, the

active beach profile can easily reach the tip of headland, ceasing beach rotation due to the 

sediment bypass.

Figure 3.31. Relation between beach rotation (computed using the 25th and 75th percentiles values of beach 
orientation obtained from Landsat images) and beach exposure to the dominant waves. 

The result of cross-shore morphological analysis show that beaches such as Baleia, Magoito and 

Grande, change between a convex shape, in the summer, due to a berm formation, and a 

concave shape, in the winter, when the berm is obliterated. Sta. Cruz, Coxos, Maçãs and Adraga 

beaches, on the other hand, usually present convex shapes and the seasonal changes are more 

related with the berm elevation and width. In latter cases, the concave shape are less frequent 

and seems to be related with winter storm events. 

The variations of the beach face slope alongshore indicate that beaches located north of Foz do 

Lizandro, are more reflective than the southern ones. This could be an effect of the beach 

sediment grain-size, which tend to be coarse in the northern beaches (as shown in the Chapter 

4), being in agreement with previous works (e.g. Bascom, 1951). 

The monitoring of the beach profiles showed, in general, higher beach retreats during the year 

of 2013 and 2014. In fact, these two years were particularity energetic, presenting the higher 

frequencies of higher waves for the period under analysis (Figure 3.7).  The most energetic 

events recorded during these years are related with the Gong storm occurred at January 19th 

2013 (see Liberato, 2014) and Christina storm occurred at January 6th 2014 (see Diogo et al., 

2014). According to the offshore wave data the average ??, ?? and ??? for these events were 

8 m, 13 s and 295?, in the case of Gong storm, and 7 m, 19 s, 297?, in the case of Christina storm.  

The morphological changes observed on beaches showed a variable response to these events. 

The Gong storm, in 2013, had strong impact on Sta. Cruz and Magoito beaches (Figure 3.15 and 

Figure 3.19) and minor impact on the Baleia (Figure 3.17), while Coxos beach do not showed

significant changes, probably due to its higher degree of embayment (Figure 3.16). However, in 

the case of the Christina storm, in 2014, the impacts are visible in all beaches, including Coxos 

beach. The main difference between these two storms is the wave period, which was quite 

longer in case of Christina storm. This storm triggered the Foz do Lizandro dune retreat (Figure 

3.18) and the lowering of topographic surface at the Coxos, Maçãs and Grande beaches (Figure 

3.16, Figure 3.20, Figure 3.21). The impacts of this storm in these and other beaches are also 

reported by Diogo et al. (2014), Carapuço et al. (2014) and Bastos et al. (2015).  

The morphological changes observed at Coxos beach, showed that on high-incised beaches, 

sediment can leave the embayment during particular extreme meteorological events. Under 

these conditions, waves induce strong erosion on the subaerial beach and a large volume of 

sediment is transported outside the embayment and, eventually, bypass the headlands. 

The data obtained after storms showed a gradual recovery of the beaches with the increasing 

of the beach surface elevation or/and the berm advance. However, Coxos beach recovery seems 

to be slower when compare to the other beaches. 

Table 3.2 shows the comparison between sand volumes estimated for Coxos and Maçãs beaches 

based on their beach profiles (above a common minimum elevation between surveys), before 

and after the storm events of 2014; and assuming that volume of the Maçãs beach, before the 

storms of 2014, was not significantly different to the one measure in 2012. Maçãs beach lost 

about 62 % of the initial sand volume, while Coxos lost about 78 %.

The sand gain estimated for a period of approximately one year and a half shows a faster 

recovery at Maçãs (29 % of the initial volume). Although the Maçãs beach has been nourished 

with sand removed from the dune, as already mentioned, the beach profiles showed that larger 

part of sand volume was recovered through a natural process (Figure 3.20). The fast recovery of 

this beach can be then explained by its lower embayment, which allowed the capture of the 

sand bypassing near the shore, as explained previously (Figure 3.28A). On the contrary, the 

higher indentation of the Coxos beach is not favourable to this HSB process. In this case, the 

beach is feed by the sediment transport shoreward during low-energy wave conditions, which 

should have a low magnitude considering the rocky nature of adjacent inner shelf (see Chapter 

2) and, justifies its slower recovering.

Beach Sedimentology 

 INTRODUCTION 

Sediment particles properties such as grain-size, shape and composition provide valuable 

information about sediment sources, transport processes and pathways. Clemens and Komar 

(1988), for example, used the heavy mineral content and the degree of grain rounding of sands 

to identify sediment sources, trace transport paths and to obtain additional information 

concerning the history of the sediment particles on the Oregon headland-bay coast (USA); 

Ferrari et al. (2014) used grain-size, composition and shape of sedimentary particles to trace 

sediment bypass between two adjacent gravel pocket beaches of the Ligurian Sea (Italy); and 

Cascalho et al. (2014) identified a sediment sorting during subaerial bypass at Nazaré headland 

(Portugal), based on the sediment grain-size. 

Following these works, beach sediment grain-size and composition were used to get further 

insights on sediment sources and distribution processes in order to understand the headland 

sediment bypassing (HSB) processes. However, considering the large extension of the studied 

coast (about 100 km), the sediment sampling was focus in a shorter stretch, located between 

Sta. Cruz (Torres Vedras) and Guincho (Cascais) (Figure 4.1). The results obtained were discuss 

considering the sedimentological information of the previous works, which are listed in the 

Table 4.1.

 METHODS 

 Field campaigns and data acquisition 

Sediment sampling was carried out during several field campaigns that are summarized in Table 

4.2. Most sediment samples correspond to the first centimetres of the surficial layer, however, 

superficial sediments correspond to the sedimentary particles that are in equilibrium with the 

effective wave conditions and might not be representative of the entire beach system. Thus, a 

sampling procedure that following the recommendations of the Beach Sand Code Project (2012) 

technical note, was also used in order to characterize the beach sediment average 

characteristics (composite sediment samples). These samples were collected at the beach face, 

using a PVC tube with 4.5 cm of diameter and 50 cm of length (Figure 4.2A and Figure 4.2B). The 

only exception was the sediment sampled at Grande beach on February 2014, which was 

manually collected and corresponds to the 32 cm of thickness of the heavy mineral deposit 

observed (Figure 4.2C).

 Laboratory work and data analysis 

Grain-size analysis was performed in all samples, while compositional analysis were only 

performed for composite sediment samples as shown in Figure 4.1. 

 Grain-size analysis  

Sediment grain-size analysis was taken by sieving method for the particles larger than 1 ? and 

by laser diffraction for particles smaller than 1 ?. Both methods were performed according to 

the internal protocols of Instituto Hidrográfico, which are based on the standards NP EN 933-1 

and ISO 13320-1. The size grade scale adopted was the Wentworth scale modified by Krumbein 

(1934) and the statistic parameters of the grain-size distributions were computed through the 

method of moments described in Boggs (1995).

 X-ray diffractometry analysis 

X-ray diffractometry is a technique usually applied to obtain the mineralogy of silty-clay 

sediments. However, according to the works presented by Hein et al. (2013), Armstrong-Altrin 

et al. (2014) and Oliveira et al. (2015), this technique can be used as a first approach to get 

insights on the major mineral phases (&gt; 2%) present in coarser sediment using a bulk of milled 

sample. Thus, sediment samples were milled to get a powder with a median grain-size of 100 

µm (3.3 ?). The mineralogical analysis was performed using a PANalytical diffractometer, with a 

CuK? radiation. Scans were run between 4? and 60?, with a 0.02° per 2? step and a counting 

time of 1 second. Mineral relative abundances was determined based on the x-ray diffractogram 

peak areas, being the basal reflections of the main minerals weighted by empirically factors 

following the criteria presented by Rocha (1993). Due to technical problems with diffractometer, 

the samples of Azul, Abano and Guincho beaches were not analysed. 

 Magnetic susceptibility analysis 

Magnetic susceptibility is a fast and non-destructive assessment of the concentration of iron-

bearing magnetic minerals that according to the work presented by Shankar et al. (1996), can 

be used as a proxy for heavy mineral content of the sediment. In mathematical terms, magnetic 

susceptibility (?) is defined as the ratio between induced magnetization per volume unit of 

measured sample (?) and applied magnetic field intensity (?). Since ? and ? have the same SI 

units (Am-1), ? is a dimensionless number (Dearing, 1999). 

This technique was applied to get insights on sediment heavy mineral content of all composite 

samples. Before measuring magnetic susceptibility, sediment samples were washed with 

distilled water, dried and well mixed in plastic containers. The measurements were performed 

with the sediment inside plastic containers, using a Bartington MS2E sensor, which measures 

the magnetic susceptibility with a high spatial resolution (3.8 mm). To avoid anomalous values, 

15 measurements at different points were taken for each sample and a median value was 

assumed.  

 Heavy minerals analysis 

The heavy mineral analysis was performed on a subset of the composite samples (see Figure 

4.1) to complement and validate the results of magnetic susceptibility. Heavy minerals are 

usually concentrated in the grain-size classes of medium to very fine sand. However, the 

sediments under analysis reveal low frequencies of very fine sand, thus the heavy mineral study 

was performed only for the grain-sizes ranging between medium and fine sand (1-3 ?). The 



Beach Sedimentology 

 

75 

weight percentage of heavy fraction was firstly computed based on the ratio between heavy and 

light mineral weights and secondly was weighted on the total sediment weight. 

The preparation of the samples included the elimination of carbonates using a 10 % solution of 

hydrochloric acid (HCl). After, sand fractions were washed and dried and, heavy and light 

minerals were separated using bromoform (density = 2.89). The required amount of grains for 

each microscopic slide was obtained using a micro-splitter and then mounted in Canada balsam 

on glass slides. Mineral particles identification and counting under the petrographic microscope 

was performed according to the ribbon method (Galehouse, 1971 in Mange and Maurer, 1992). 

The percentage of each mineral specie (in each sample) was computed based on the total 

number of grains counted (about 600 grains per sample).  

 Principal components analysis  

Compositional data interpretation was supported by the principal components analysis (PCA). 

This analysis was applied in order to reduce the number of possibly correlated variables (i.e. 

mineral species) into a fewer uncorrelated variables (principal components) that are linear 

combinations of the original ones. The objective of this analysis is to reduce the number of 

variables of the data set, but retain as much of the original variability in the data as possible. 

Two PCA were performed using the STATISTCA software. The first one explore the major 

minerals phases of the sediment, while the second one explore the main transparent heavy 

minerals identified. 

 RESULTS 

 Beach sediment grain-size 

The grain-size distributions of the composite samples show that beach sediment is mainly 

composed by coarse sand (1 ? to 2 ?) with a modal class of 0.75 ?, in the most cases, or 0.25 ?, 

in the cases of Calada and Coxos beaches. Exceptions are São Lourenço beach that is mainly 

composed by very coarse sand (0 ? to -1 ?) and present significant percentages of gravel (-1 ? to 

-2 ?); and the placer sediment (collected at Grande beach) that is mainly composed by medium 

sand (1 ? to 2 ?) (Figure 4.3). 

The superficial sediment samples are also mainly composed by coarse sand with a model class 

of 0.75 ?. Nevertheless, Calada beach sediment presented, once again, a slightly coarser mode 

(0.25 ?). The sediment sampled at Adraga and Grande low-tide terrace and at Coxos submarine

beach showed higher percentages of medium sand particles (1-2 ?); in the latter case, it can be 

also noticed an increasing of fine sand particles (2-3 ?) (Figure 4.4).

The relation between the mean, standard deviation and skewness of sediment grain-size shows 

that the southern beaches tend to be finer, well sorted and fine skewed than the northern 

beaches. In what concerns to the beaches where both sampling methods were applied, it can 

be noticed that, Baío, Calada, Coxos and Maçãs composite sediment is clearly coarser and less 

sorted than the superficial sediment, in opposition to Foz do Lizandro, Pequena, Grande, Adraga 

and Guincho, which have slightly differences. On the other hand, low-tide terrace sediment 

collected at Adraga and Grande beaches is finer and well sorted than the one collected at Coxos, 

but have a mean grain-size similar to the Coxos submarine beach sediment (Figure 4.5).

Considering the mean grain-size, most of sediment samples are classified as coarse sand; 

exceptions are the sample collected at São Lourenço, a very coarse sand, and the samples 

collected at the low-tide terrace of the Grande and Adraga beaches, at the submarine beach of 

Coxos and at placer of the Grande beach, classified as medium sand. 

 Beach sediment composition 

 Major minerals 

X-ray diffractometry results show that the beach sediments under analysis are mainly composed 

by quartz, calcite and potassium feldspar, with median percentages above 17 %. Dolomite, 

aragonite, plagioclase and hematite have lower percentages that do not exceed 5 % (Figure 4.6). 

The placer sample collected at Grande beach has a peculiar mineral assemblage, mainly 

composed by heavy minerals, such as ilmenite (37 %), magnetite (30 %), hematite (12 %), garnet 

(8 %) and zircon (6 %), while light minerals such as potassium feldspar, calcite and quartz have 

residual percentages (? 3 %).

dolomite; ARG – aragonite; PLG – plagioclase; HEM – hematite; ZIR – zircon; GAR – garnet; MAG – magnetite;

percentiles; the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values. The mineralogy of the placer sample 
collected at Grande beach is represented separately by dots. 

The relative percentages of major minerals obtained for each beach show an increasing of 

carbonate content from north to south, mainly related with calcite and aragonite percentages.

78 %, respectively) and dolomite (20 and 11 %, respectively). The results also put in evidence 

the significant differences between Grande beach sediment collected during modal (GRA 

sample) and after-storm conditions (GRAplacer sample). In the first case, sediment presents a 

mineralogical signature not much different from the adjacent beaches, dominated by light 

minerals, while in the second case the sediment is dominated by heavy minerals as previously 

mentioned (Figure 4.7).

 Magnetic susceptibility 

The results of magnetic susceptibility are quite consistent despite variations within each sample, 

related with the high spatial resolution of the sensor used. The beaches located north of 

Lamporeira headland (Sta. Cruz, Azul and Baío) have a magnetic signal almost null. South of this 

headland, magnetic signal tends to increase, reaching the highest values at Grande beach, which 

are up to two orders of magnitude higher. South of Grande beach magnetic signal back to 

decrease (Figure 4.8A). Placer sample have a magnetic signal extremely high with a median 

value of 7.1×10-1, 30 times higher than the median value obtained for modal conditions 

(2.3×10- 2) (Figure 4.8B). 

 

Figure 4.8. Magnetic susceptibility of beach sediment: (A) “regular” samples and (B) placer sample of the 
Grande beach. The box-plots are divided by the 50th percentile, while its limits are the 25th and 75th 
percentiles; the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values.   

 Heavy minerals 

Heavy mineral content (expressed in weight percentage) increases from Azul to Grande and 

decreases from Grande to Guincho. The heavy mineral percentages found at Grande beach are 

significantly higher than the ones observed at the other beaches. The placer sample collected in 

this beach reveal a heavy mineral concentration 25 times higher than the one found in the 

“regular” sediment sample (Figure 4.9).  

The lower percentages of heavy mineral fraction found at Azul beach did not allow to obtain a 

number of heavy mineral particles with statistical significance. Thus, the results of heavy mineral 



Beach Sedimentology 

 

81 

species of Azul beach were not considerate. Fourteen transparent heavy mineral species were 

identified under the petrographic microscope, but only half of these species have median 

percentages greater than 1 %. Those minerals are: tourmaline (24.5 %), clinopyroxene (21.3 %), 

garnet (18.4 %), staurolite (15.4 %), andaluzite (7.2 %), amphibole (5.0 %) and zircon (1.2 %). 

Epidote and rutile are less abundant (? 0.5 %) and apatite, titanite, biotite, cyanite and sillimanite 

are vestigial (Figure 4.10).

The relative percentages of the main transparent minerals (&gt;1 %) are shown in Figure 4.11. The 

results indicate that the beach heavy mineral signature is quite similar, despite some 

singularities found at São Lourenço beach (high percentage of amphibole and garnet), Foz do 

Lizandro beach (high percentage of clinopyroxene) and Grande beach (high percentage of 

garnet). The most exotic deposit was the placer of Grande beach which has a peculiar signature 

mainly composed by garnet (61 %), staurolite (23 %) and zircon (6 %).

 Principal components 

PCA applied to the major mineral species shows that 53 % of the total variance is explained by 

the component 1 that separates Grande placer sample from the other ones, based on the 

opposition between heavy and light mineral. The component 2 explains 21 % of the total

higher percentages of quartz and dolomite presented by those beaches (Figure 4.12).

In the case of main transparent heavy minerals, PCA results show that the two main components 

explain 90 % of the total variance. Component 1 explains 71 % of the total variance and separates 

both sediment samples collected at Grande beach from the other ones. This separation is related 

with the opposition between the denser mineral species such as staurolite, garnet and zircon 

from the other ones. Component 2 explains 17 % of the total variance and basically shows a 

slight detachment of the São Lourenço beach, mainly related with the amphibole values (Figure 

4.13).

Beach Sedimentology

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Sediment grain-size analysis shows that the studied beaches have, in general, mean grain-sizes 

of coarse sand. Exception are: (1) the very coarse sand of Lourenço beach; (2) the medium sands 

collected at low-tide terrace of the Grande and Adraga beaches and at the submarine domain 

of the Coxos beach; and (3) the medium sand of the Grande beach placer, collected after a major 

storm (Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5).  

The sediment grain-size analysis was limited to the beaches located in the stretch between Sta. 

Cruz and Guincho. To have a wider view of the grain-size variations along the study coast, the 

mean grain-size of superficial beach face sediment samples was projected together with the 

mean grain-size of the beach face sediment analysed in previous works (Figure 4.14A). Despite 

the constrained imposed by the different number of samples used to estimate the average 

values of each beach, as well as the differences in the sediment sampling date and method, it 

can be noticed that coarser sediment are in the stretches with a N-S and NW-SE general 

orientation (the rockier inner shelf sectors as shown in the Chapter 2). 

Composite sediments allowed a better characterization of the beaches alongshore, showing that 

beaches located north of the Foz do Lizandro, particularly, in the stretch between Lamporeira 

and Foz do Lizandro, tend to be coarser than the southern ones (Figure 4.14B). This trend is 

compatible with a selective sediment transport process southward, where finer particles bypass 

the headlands, while coarser ones are trapped inside the bays. 

Previous assumption is also supported by the field observations at Ursa beach, where the rocks 

of the Sintra Igneous Complex contact with the Jurassic superior limestones. The cobbles and 

boulders particles resulting from the erosion of the referred rocks showed a weak mixture inside 

the bay, suggesting that gravel particles have low transport rates and are trapped inside the bays 

(Figure 4.15). 

The sediment grain-size decreasing observed towards offshore, along the Coxos, Grande and 

Adraga beaches profiles also support the existence of a selective transport process. In the first 

case, sediment of the beach face and low-tide terrace was composed by coarse sand that gave 

place to medium sands at the submarine beach; while in the two latter cases, the coarse sands 

of beach face gave place a medium sand at the low-tide terrace. The medium sand found at the 

lower beach domains is in agreement with the inner shelf medium sand deposits mapped by IH 

(2010) up to 10/20 m depth, where they gave place to fine sands. These results indicate once 

again that coarser particles remain inside the bays, while finer ones are transported offshore 

and, eventually, bypass the headlands.

al., 2013); and (B) mean grain-size of the composite sediment samples.

metamorphosed limestone (white cobbles), granite and syenite (pink cobbles) and gabbro and basalt (black

Despite the selective process identified alongshore, there are grain-size variations that should 

be related with geomorphological constrains and/or local sediment sources, being the most 

notorious case the São Lourenço beach (Figure 4.14B). 

The mean grain-size of composite sediments was projected against the beach embayment index, 

but a weak relation was found (Figure 4.16), suggesting that the coarser sediment of São 

Lourenço can be directly provided by the Safarujo river. The same can be assumed for Maçãs 

beach, located at the Colares river mouth, that has a coarser sediment compared to the nearby 

beaches (Figure 4.14B).

Figure 4.16. Relation between mean grain-size of composite sediments and beach embayment index. 

The compositional analysis shows that beach sediment is mainly composed by quartz, feldspar 

and carbonate particles, except in the particular case of placer deposit. Despite some local 

variations, such as the higher percentages of quartz and dolomite of the Calada and São 

Lourenço beaches that could be related with the local sediment sources, the only trend observed 

alongshore is the increase of carbonate content southward, mainly calcite (Figure 4.7). However, 

the origin of the carbonate particles was not clarified, so it cannot be used for sedimentary 

dynamics proposes. Moreover, these results must be viewed with some caution, because they 

correspond to a first attempt to study the mineralogy of these sediments. The latter tests 

performed by Oliveira et al. (2016), show that median grain-size of the powder used in these 

analysis can lead to inaccuracies in the relative percentages of the mineral phases. 

The transparent heavy mineral assemblages found in the beaches between São Lourenço and 

Guincho are quite similar and, are in agreement with mineral assemblages observed by Balsinha 

et al. (2010) in the beaches located between Peniche and Foz do Lizandro. This mineralogical 

homogeneity impedes tracing sediment sources and transport pathways. According to the work 

presented by Cascalho et al. (2016), held in conjunction with this work, the mineralogical 

homogeneity of these beaches can be explained by the great variety of lithological types 

(sedimentary, igneous and contact metamorphism rocks) found in the watersheds drained to 

the littoral. 

Despite the few samples, the correlation between magnetic susceptibility and the weight 

percentage of heavy mineral was good, allowing the use of the magnetic signal as a proxy for

the heavy mineral concentration (Figure 4.17). Thus, according to the magnetic susceptibility 

results, heavy mineral concentration increases southward, reaching a maximum at Grande 

beach, for both modal (“regular” samples) and after-storm (placer sample) conditions (Figure 

4.8). The high content of heavy minerals of the Grande beach sediment, compared to the other 

beaches, only can be explained by a long-term cumulative process promoted by the Calhau do 

Corvo headland at the downdrift limit of the beach. This headland is originated by the outcrop 

of Cretaceous limestone compact rocks exhibiting a subvertical stratification and a direction 

approximately perpendicular to the general orientation of the coastline, being a natural 

structural barrier to the longshore drift. 

 

Figure 4.17. Relation between magnetic susceptibility (median value) and the weight percentage of heavy 
minerals. 

The heavy mineral placer deposit observed at Grande beach resulted from an efficient grain 

density sorting induced by the storm events occurred in the begging of 2014 (also mentioned in 

Chapter 3). Nonetheless, the large size of this deposit and its peculiar mineralogy, which include 

high percentages of ilmenite, magnetite, hematite, garnet, staurolite and zircon, should result 

from the combination between the referred long-term cumulative process, promoted by the 

Calhau do Corvo headland, and a short-term process related with the sorting promoted by the 

storm event.  This assumption is in agreement with the model proposed by Peterson et al. 

(1986), based on their observations at the headland-bay coast of Oregon (U.S.A). According to 

these authors, placers development is controlled by shoreline configuration, as the first-order 

factor, and seasonal variations of wave climate and longshore currents, as second-order factors.

These results show once again a selective bypassing process, where the heavier particles are 

trapped inside the embayment, while the lighter ones are transported offshore; once lighter 

particles reach the tip of the headlands, they can be entrained by the longshore flows and bypass 

the headlands. This selective process is particularity efficient during high-energy conditions.  

Concluding, beach sediment textural and compositional analyses indicate that HSB is a selective 

process. According to the results its can assumed that coarser particles such gravel and very 

coarse sand tend to be trapped inside the embayments, being their bypass very low or negligible. 

Coarse sand bypass occur mainly at the subaerial beach, considering the high frequency of these 

particles in the beach face and low-tide terrace sediments. Their bypass should occur in relation 

with the beach rotation process, as explained in the previous chapter; except during major storm 

events, when the wave energy triggers an extreme efficient selective process, transporting the 

lighter sediment particles towards offshore (including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral 

placer deposits on subaerial beach. In the case of medium sand particles, headland bypass can 

occur either subaerial beach or inner shelf domain, depend on the wave energy; while fine sand 

bypass occur mainly at the inner shelf, considering the low frequency of these particles in the 

beach sediments and fine sand deposits of the inner shelf.

Longshore Sediment Transport 

 INTRODUCTION 

Longshore sediment transport or longshore drift plays a major role in coastal processes. Intense 

efforts have been made to estimate longshore drift with the development of empirical formulas 

based on laboratory tests and field experiments data (e.g. Komar and Inman, 1970; CERC, 1984; 

Kraus et al., 1988; Kamphuis, 1991), numerical models (Hanson, 1989; Larson et al., 2002; Trouw 

et al., 2012), and through field measurements, such as sediment accumulation rates in harbours 

or groins (see the database summarized by Schoonees and Theron, 1993), short-term sediment 

impoundment (Bodge and Dean, 1987), sediment tracers (Ingle, 1966; Komar and Inman, 1970; 

Duane and James, 1980; Kraus et al., 1981; Taborda et al., 1994; Ciavola et al., 1997; Vila-Concejo 

et al., 2004; Tonk and Masselink, 2005; Silva et al., 2007; Fernández- Fernández et al., 2015), 

streamer sediment traps (Kraus and Dean, 1987; Rosati et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1998;  Tonk 

and Masselink, 2005), optical devices (Downing et al., 1981; Taborda et al., 1999; Aagaard et al., 

2002; Tonk and Masselink, 2005) and acoustic sensors (Vincent and Green, 1990; Vincent et al., 

1991). In the present work, longshore sediment transport was studied using two different but 

complementary approaches. The first one, targeted the understanding of short-term processes 

and was based on a tracer experiment, relating the longshore drift rate with the hydrodynamic 

conditions. The experiment was designed to study headland sediment bypassing (HSB) and 

selective sediment transport processes. The second one was addressed to macroscale processes

92 

and aimed at understanding longshore transport patterns along the studied coastal stretch. This 

latter approach was supported by the evaluation of net longshore drift by an empirical 

formulation and using an extended wave time-series. 

  SHORT-TERM APPROACH 

The tracer experiment was carried out at Grande beach, located 3.5 km north of the Roca cape 

(Figure 5.1). As shown in Chapter 3, Grande beach extends for about 1 km with a NNE-SSW 

orientation, has high exposure to the NW dominant waves and presents a low-degree of 

embayment (within the range values of the studied beaches). This beach displays a clockwise 

rotation during summer and a counter-clockwise rotation in the winter. The cross-shore 

morphology varies between convex shape due to the presence of a well-developed berm, in the 

summer, and concave shape due to the berm obliteration, in the winter. In the northern sector 

the mean beach face slope and maximum berm crest elevation observed were 4? and 3.5 m, 

receptively; while in the southern sector, were 6? and 4.4 m, respectively. Beach sediment is 

mainly composed by coarse sand that tends to gets finer seaward (see Chapter 4).

 Methods 

 Tracer approach 

The use of tracers to estimate longshore drift can be done through spatial integration method 

(SIM), time integration method (TIM) and continuous injection method (CIM) (Ingle and 

Gorsline, 1973; Madsen, 1987). In the present work, the CIM (also known as dilution method) 

was applied, injecting a known quantity of tracer at a given position, at a constant rate, over a 

given sufficient time to allow stabilization of the tracer flux rate downdrift, measured at one or 

more locations. The application of the principle of tracer mass conservation, assuming that a 

steady state can be reached, yields that the rate which the tracer is introduced into the transport 

system equals the rate that tracer leaves the transport system. Thus, longshore sediment 

transport (?) can be given by: 

 ? =
?

?????
 (5.1) 

where ???  is the steady state or equilibrium concentration measured at a point downdrift of the 

injection site and ? is the volumetric tracer injection rate, which can be deduced from the tracer 

dry mass injection rate (??? ) using the equation: 

 ? =
???

(1 ? ?)??
 (5.2) 

where ??  is the quartz density and ? the sand porosity (assumed as 0.4). 

CIM was selected due to the advantages point out by Duane and James (1980), namely: (1) tracer 

sampling can be accomplished at relatively few fixed locations and there is no need to monitor 

the entire spatial extent of the dispersing tracer cloud, thus minimizing attendant logistic 

difficulties and sampling problems associated with increasing dilution of tracer concentration 

with time; (2) problems associated with increasing dilution of tracer are not a factor because, 

theoretically, in steady state conditions, tracer concentration will increase throughout the 

experiment, until it reaches equilibrium; (3) it is not necessary to determine thickness of the 

active layer nor the width of the transport system, because demonstration of lateral constancy 

on the equilibrium concentration, across the transport system, is sufficient to validate the 

experimental results. The experimental results validation can be done by establishing sampling 

locations transverse to the transport zone, at several distances from the injection point.  

If these experiments are performed during relatively short periods of time, the risk of wave 

changing conditions is reduced comparatively with TIM and SIM. Furthermore, it does not 

requires a vertical sampling (sediment cores), because it is not necessary to sample the entire 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

94 

mixing layer. A superficial layer sample with approximately 1 cm is sufficient. In fact, sampling 

should not exceed mixing depth to avoid sampling sediment below the active layer that may 

lead to an underestimation of the tracer concentration. 

 Preparation of fluorescent tracer 

The preparation of the tracer experience was carried out in conjunction with the tracer 

experiment of the Beach to Canyon project4, in order to take advantage of the necessary 

logistics, which otherwise would be very heavy. For this reason the sediment used in the tracer 

experiment of Grande beach was non-native, being collected at Norte beach, located north of 

the study site (at Nazaré). Norte beach sediment is characterized by a wide grain-size range, with 

a median grain-size ranging from fine gravel (-2.6 ?) to medium sand (1.79 ?) (Cascalho et al., 

2012), ideal to support the study of selective transport processes. On the other hand, it also 

include the grain-size range of Grande beach sediment (see Chapter 4). 

From approximately 12 tons of sediment collected at Norte beach, 1.7 tons were used in the 

tracer experiment of Grande beach. The sediment tagging process included sediment washing, 

dryness and painting. For better adhesion of the ink on the grains surface the sediment was 

washed with running freshwater, inside of permeable big bags, until the salt particles were 

completely removed. The washed sediment was dispersed on the ground at a storehouse to dry, 

before being painted with a mixture of orange fluorescent ink and cellulose diluent. The ink and 

diluent quantities were estimated based on tests performed by Silva (2005) that suggests the 

use of a mixture composed by 40 % of ink and 60 % of diluent, and then, a 1:30 proportion of 

diluted ink and sediment. Painting was performed for sediment portions of 100 to 130 kg, using 

a concrete mixer in motion to minimize sediment aggregation during the drying process. Finally, 

the tracer was stored in portions of about 16 kg inside polyethylene bags (Figure 5.2).

 Fieldwork and data acquisition 

The tracer experiment was scheduled for the end of summer season, considering that the 

maximum beach rotation occurs during the summer, due to the persistent NW low-energy wave 

conditions (Chapter 3), which are favourable to the HSB. Few days before the field campaign, 

wave forecasting indicated a change in wave direction that was not favourable to the southward 

sediment transport. However, taking into account the scheduling and logistics constraints 

inherent in fieldwork it was not possible to postpone the experiment until favourable HSB 

conditions so, experiment was carried out on September 8th of 2014. 

A northward longshore drift current was confirmed in the experiment day with floating devices 

(oranges) tossed into the breaker zone. Thus, injection point and sampling sites were defined 

according to these conditions, as shown in Figure 5.3.

acquired on June 2012, provided by Direcção-Geral do Território - DGT). 

Morphological changes were monitored on three cross-shore beach profiles with a GPS-RTK, 

during low tide levels before and after the tracer experiment. Although it was not necessary for 

the tracer dilution method, the thickness of the active layer was measured during the low tide 

subsequent to the tracer experiment, based on sediment thickness deposited above the washers

on the rods. However, only 6 rods (on the low-tide terrace) remained from the initial 13, thus 

thickness of the mixing layer in the beach face was obtained from the tracer vertical 

displacement observed at 6 ditches opened along a cross-shore profile downdrift the tracer 

injection site (Figure 5.3). 

Oceanographic conditions (tide, waves and currents) were monitored along a cross-shore 

profile, at approximately 29 m, 43 m and 51 m offshore the tracer injection point (Figure 5.3). 

The first monitoring point included a pressure transductor (PT70), the second one included a 

pressure transductor (PT72) and an electromagnetic current meter (EMCM), and the third one 

included an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADP). The acquisition frequency of the PTs and 

EMCM was 2 Hz, while for the ADP was 1 Hz. Once these sensors were offshore the breaking 

zone during the tracer injection, direction and magnitude of the longshore drift current, were 

also estimated using floating devices (oranges) tossed into the breaker zone. These estimations 

were done at several locations along the sediment sampling stretch. The wave direction was 

monitored using a video camera placed at Calhau do Corvo headland (Figure 5.3). 

The tracer experiment was carried out around the high-tide level, when the surf zone was 

narrower and the waves were plunging at the beach face, avoiding therefore a great dispersion 

of the tracer on the low-tide terrace and the rip currents, which are more active during lower 

tide levels. Tracer was injected at the inferior limit of the swash zone, at a 16 kg.min-1 rate, during 

1 hour and 46 minutes (from 14:09 to 15:55). Superficial sediment samples (?1 cm thickness) 

were collected along 13 downdrift cross-shore profiles spaced by 25 m, from the injection site 

(Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4). Sediment sampling was also performed along one updrift cross-

shore profile, located 25 m from the injection site, to check for any inversion in the longshore 

drift during experiment. Sampling began 10 minutes after the beginning of tracer injection and 

extended for about 1 hour and 10 minutes after the injection ended. Sediment sampling cycle 

over all profiles lasted about 20 to 30 minutes, but due to the limited number of persons, it was 

not performed synchronously. 

Even with the northward longshore drift, two sediment samples southward of injection point 

were collected after the tracer experiment, one at Adraga beach (20:15) and another one at the 

tip of Calhau do Corvo headland (20:30). Sediment of the inner sandbar was also sampled at 

about 400 m downdrift of the injection point (21:50). The grain-size analysis of these sediment 

was already presented in Chapter 4, but is presented and discussed in this chapter together with 

the tracer results.

 Data processing and analysis 

Oceanographic data  

Wave parameters (height and period) were computed for 10 minutes interval, from the spectral 

analysis of the pressure transducers records, accounting for pressure attenuation according to 

Kamphuis (2000). The magnitude of cross-shore and longshore currents measured by the EMCM 

were averaged for each 10 minutes interval, while current data acquired by the ADP were 

processed for a 30 minutes interval, using SonTek ViewADP software. The wave direction and 

wave breaking angle were obtained from the video images, which were corrected and rectified 

using a set of ground control points acquired during the image acquisition, following the work 

of Taborda and Silva (2012). 

Sedimentological data 

The sediment grain-size analysis was performed for a sub-set of the samples collected during 

the experiment (23 from 286 samples), in order to compare the grain-size distribution of the 

Grande beach sediment and the tracer sediment. The analysis was performed according to the 

method described in section 4.2.2.1 of the previous chapter. 

Tracer data 

Sediment samples collected for the tracer analysis were washed with freshwater and dried in an 

oven at 100?C; afterwards each sample was well mixed and spread on black boards, in a way

that the sediment completely covered the board, before being photographed with white and 

ultraviolet (UV) light using a digital camera (Figure 5.5).  

 

Figure 5.5. (A) Spreading of a portions of sediment sample in a black board and (B) image acquisition system. 

Tracer particles detection and counting were done by image analysis using a MATLAB toolbox 

(SedPhoto2 toolbox – see Appendix B). This toolbox converts, originally acquired RGB images 

into Lab colour space images (Hunter labs, 1996) and, identifies the area occupied by each tracer 

particle through image segmentation (image binarization). The image segmentation process is 

defined based on threshold values for a and b (colour-opponent dimensions) obtained from the 

spectral signature of the tracer particles, and based on an adjustment of L (lightness). This 

procedure can be done using the UV light images only; however, as some shells particles 

reflected in the same spectral range of tracer particles, white light images were also used to 

differentiate shells from tracer (under white light, shells display a white colour while tracer 

displays an orange colour). 

Based on the area of tracer particles computed with SedPhoto2, it was possible to perform a 

grain-size analysis, assuming an equivalent diameter. Tracer particles were grouped in 1 ? 

classes and the individual frequency of each class was estimated, allowing the computation of a 

mean grain-size of tracer for each sample. 

The tracer concentration, or dilution, was obtained through the ratio between the area occupied 

by the tracer particles and the image area. To estimate a longshore drift rates, these relative 

dilutions were converted into mass dilutions using a calibration curve. This curve was developed 

based on standard dilutions obtained with controlled masses of the tracer relatively to the 

natural beach sediment. The standard dilution samples were, equally, photographed and 

processed with the SedPhoto2 toolbox. The relation between the relative area dilutions (??) 

and the standard mass dilutions (??), was obtained by a least square linear fitting forcing the

regression line to pass though the origin (Figure 5.6). The tracer dilution of each sediment 

sample was then computed considering all tracer particles and for each tracer grain-size class. 

 

Figure 5.6. Relation between standard mass dilution (??) obtained from controlled masses of tracer and 

relative area dilution (?? ) obtained from the image analysis. 

 Tracer concentration modelling 

Tracer dilution is a consequence of advection and diffusion processes. Thus, an analytical 

solution of advection-diffusion equation (ADE) was used to model the tracer concentrations 

observed alongshore over the time. According to Socolofsky and Jirka (2005), 1D ADE is given by 

expression:

 Longshore sediment transport  

The longshore drift rate was computed from the equation (5.1), based on the tracer equilibrium 

concentration (????? ), and on the volumetric tracer injection rate (16 kg.min
-1). The rate obtained 

was compared with the rate estimated by the Bagnold (1963) approach that relates the 

immersed weight sediment transport with the wave energy flux and the longshore drift current. 

According to the simplifications proposed by Komar (1998) based on the wave linear theory, this 

approach can be given by: 

 ?? = ????

 (5.5) 

where ????  is the mean longshore current velocity; ? = 1 8? ????
2 is the total wave energy (? is 

the sea water density (1025 kgm-3), ? is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 ms-2) and ?? is the 

breaking wave height); ?? dimensionless empirical coefficient, assumed as 0.28 according to 

Komar and Inman (1970), when root mean square wave height at the breaking is used to 

compute the total wave energy. 

The immersed weight transport rates were converted into volumetric sediment transport rates 

(?) by the relation ?? = (?? ? ?)(1 ? ?)??, where ??  is the sediment density (quartz density 

was assumed 2650 kgm-3), and ? is the sand porosity (0.4).

 Beach morphology  

Topographic profiles show that the beach had a steep beach face (???? = 0.12) with a low-

gradient tide terrace (???? = 0.03) and that the berm width and elevation increased from north 

to south. The comparison of the profiles surveyed during low-tide before and after the 

experiment, revealed no significant morphological changes (Figure 5.7 to Figure 5.9).

 Oceanographic conditions 

The variation of water level measured at the three monitoring sites is presented in Figure 5.10; 

it can be noticed that water level measured by ADP is higher than PTs, which can be explained 

by a sinking of the ADP structure relative to the initial position. The tracer experiment began 35 

minutes before the high-tide and ended 2 hours and half afterwards, during this period water 

level variation was about 1.2 m.  

 

Figure 5.10. Water level relative to the MSL measured by ADP and PTs.  

The wave parameters obtained from the two PTs records are in agreement. The mean significant 

wave height (??) and mean zero crossing wave period (??) were 0.7 m and 6 s, respectively 

(Figure 5.11 and Figure 5.12).

Figure 5.12. Wave zero crossing period (??) computed from pressure transducers records. 

The video images show a crossed sea state during the field experiment (Figure 5.13). Two wave 

sets can be observed, one coming from W with directions approximately between 270? and 

280?, the other one coming from NW with directions approximately between 310? and 320?. 

The analysis of rectified images shows a negative wave breaking angle, i.e northward. However, 

the angles measured on the images vary alongshore. For example, the angle measured south of 

the injection point (21?, see Figure 5.14A) is considerably larger than the one measured 

northward of this point (7? in Figure 5.14A and 6? in Figure 5.14B).

The depth-average velocity measured by ADP reached the highest magnitudes when the waves 

were breaking closer to the sensor, with maximum values of 0.64 and 0.47 m.s-1 at the beginning 

and the end of the record, respectively. Under these conditions, the flow was northward. During 

the tracer experiment period, the water column above the sensor was higher (offshore the 

breaking zone), being the flow magnitude lower (&amp;lt;0.1 m.s-1) and southward (Figure 5.15). 

The longshore current velocity measured by EMCM present a similar pattern, despite the slightly 

lower maximum magnitudes in the beginning and end of the record (0.54 and 0.42 m.s-1, 

respectively). On the other hand, the cross-shore current measured by EMCM present negative 

values that, considering the sensor position, indicate a flow towards offshore with magnitudes 

ranging between 0.003 and 0.12 m.s-1 (Figure 5.15).

The results of the measurements with floating devices show that longshore drift during the 

tracer experiment was northward, being possible to notice an increase of the current magnitude 

over time. The magnitudes measured using this method reached values significantly higher 

(?  2  m.s-1) compared to the sensors. However, the mean value was 0.79 m.s-1, close to the 

magnitudes measured by the sensors under the breaking wave conditions. Furthermore, no 

clear relation between magnitudes and alongshore position was found (Figure 5.16).

 Thickness of sediment active layer  

The thickness of active layer was measured based on sediment deposited on rods and from the 

tracer vertical displacement (Figure 5.17). It should be noted that despite the overlapping 

representation of the profiles, these were located at distinct positions along the coast. Rod’s 

profile was located close to the tracer injection point, while ditches profile was located 150 m 

downdrift the injection point and corresponded to the beach face domain. 

 

Figure 5.17. Thickness of the active layer measured on ditches through the tracer vertical mixing and on 
sediment deposition measured on rods. 

The results show that the mixing depth increased from 6 to 11 cm from berm crest to the base 

of the beach face, while at the transition zone, between beach face and low-tide terrace (around 

50 m from the profile origin), mixing depths were smaller than the ones obtained with rods. 

These differences can be related with measurement inaccuracies due to the presence of water 

and to differences of profile morphology, especially when in presence of cusps systems, as can 

noticed by the concave and convex shape of the two profiles. The mixing depth at the low-tide 

terrace varied between 8 and 11 cm. 

 Grain-size of the tracer particles and beach native sediment 

Grain-size distributions obtained from laboratorial analysis show that sediment samples 

collected at the beach face and berm of Grande beach had mean grain-sizes between 0.60 ? and 

0.9 ? (coarse sand), with standard deviations inferior to 0.38 ? (well to very well sorted). The 

sediment used to trace transport, on the other hand, had mean grain-sizes between - 0.06 ? and 

0.44 ? (very coarse to coarse sand), and standard deviations between 0.68 ? and 0.80 ?

(moderately to moderately well sorted). Despite the differences in grain-size distributions of the 

tracer and the beach native sediment, tracer grain-size range covers the entire grain-size range 

of Grande beach (Figure 5.18).  

The sediment collected at Calhau do Corvo and Adraga beach presents a grain-size distribution 

similar to the sediments collected at beach face and berm of Grande beach; although, in the 

case of Adraga, a slight enrichment in medium sand is observed. On the other hand, the 

sediment collected at the inner sandbar is clearly finer compare to the beach face and berm of 

the Grande beach. 

 

Figure 5.18. Grain-size distribution of beach native sediment and tracer samples, obtained from laboratory 
analysis. 

The grain-size analysis of tracer particles found in sediment samples collected during the tracer 

experiment (computed by image analysis), show three main grain-size modal classes: very 

coarse sand (-1 ? to 0 ?), coarse sand (0 ? to 1 ?) and medium sand (1 ? to 2 ?). The results also 

show the existence of particles smaller than 3 ? that, according to the laboratory grain-size 

analysis of the tracer sediment, had null percentages (Figure 5.19).

Figure 5.19. Grain-size distributions of tracer particles on the sediment samples obtained from image analysis. 

The spatial analysis of the tracer particles show that mean grain-size decreased with the 

longshore distance to the injection point. In the cross-shore direction, the mean grain-size 

decreasing occurred from the lower to higher elevations, correspondingly from lower beach face 

to upper beach face (Figure 5.20).

 Tracer dilution 

Tracer concentrations of each sediment sample were computed, first, considering all tracer 

particles, and then separately for each grain-size class (Figure 5.21). Updrift of the injection site 

(-25 m), concentrations were null; while downdrift, as expected, tracer concentration decreased 

with the distance. The exception is the medium gravel, which has a small significance and did 

not show any distribution pattern. Up to 50 m downdrift, tracer concentration show large 

variations along the sampling profiles and an abrupt decreasing in a short time after the tracer 

injection ended, mainly for coarser particles. Between 75 and 100 m downdrift, it is possible to 

observe that concentration increased and then then became steadier. This is particularity 

evident for the finer particles (medium to very fine sand), which reached the steady state earlier. 

In the case of coarser particles, as well as in the case where all tracer particles were considered, 

the steady state condition is not so evident. For distances greater than 100 m, concentration 

increased slower, mainly for coarse sediments, and steady state was not reached. 

The sediments collected at the inner sandbar, Calhau do Corvo tip and Adraga beach did not 

reveal any tracer particle.

The relationship between the tracer dilution and the topographic elevation show that the 

highest concentrations occurred between 1.5 and 2.5 m (MSL), and that coarser particles (fine 

gravel and very coarse sand) tended to concentrate below 2 m (Figure 5.22).

 Discussion 

 Beach morphology and oceanographic conditions 

During the tracer experiment (September 8th 2014), Grande beach presented a well-developed 

berm, a steep beach face and a low-gradient tide terrace (Figure 5.7 to Figure 5.9). Under these 

conditions, the tracer experiment had to be carried out during high-tide, when the surf zone was 

narrower and the waves were plunging at the beach face, avoided tracer dispersion on the low-

tide terrace. 

This fact, led that oceanographic sensors staying most of the time offshore the breaking zone, 

explaining the low magnitude of the longshore current during high-tide level. However, at the 

beginning and end of the current records, when the waves were breaking on the sensors, the 

measured flow was clearly northward and had a magnitude between 0.42 and 0.64 m.s-1 (Figure 

5.15). The mean longshore current measured with floaters was higher (0.79 m.s-1), due to the 

higher speeds (2 m.s-1) measured at the end of the experiment that seem too high and should 



Longshore Sediment Transport 

 

113 

be an effect of sea breeze (Figure 5.16). Thus, in the following sections an average value of 

0.62 m.s- 1, estimated from the previous three values, was considered. 

The incident waves were coming from W and NW directions and were characterized by an 

average ?? of 0.7 m and average ?? of 6 s. The northward longshore current indicate that the 

flow was dominated by the waves coming from W. However, the interpretation of the incident 

wave angles at the breaking seem difficult, considering the variations alongshore due to the 

topo-bathymetric spatial variability and wave interference (Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14). 

 Tracer dilution modelling and longshore drift 

Tracer concentration distributions presented in Figure 5.21 show a great variation along 

sampling profiles located at 25 and 50 m downdrift the injection point, as well as an abrupt 

decay of concentration after the end of the injection, mainly for the coarser particles. This 

suggest that at these distances tracer was not completely mixed within the active beach 

transport system. Between 75 and 100 m away from the injection point, steady state 

concentration of finer particles (?1?) is clearly observed. For coarser particles this state is not 

so evident, meaning that the tracer injection should have been extended in time either by using 

more tracer or through a lower injection rate. Tide level variation during the tracer experiment 

(approx. 1.20 m) is also a factor that does not match steady state condition. 

Nevertheless, the application of the advection-diffusion model to simulate tracer dilution 

revealed, in general, a reasonable fit to data, supporting the equilibrium concentration 

identified from the tracer dilutions. Model results for overall tracer particles and for very coarse, 

coarse, medium and fine sand particles are presented in Figure 5.23 to Figure 5.27, for distances 

between 75 and 150 m. The results for the remaining distances can be seen in the Appendix C.  

Due to the deficient mixture of coarser particles at 25 and 50 m from the injection point, the 

tracer dilution of the coarse and very coarse sand, as well as the ones obtained considering all 

tracer particles, at these distances, were not use in the nonlinear optimization to find advection 

velocity and diffusion coefficient. 

Medium gravel was excluded from the analysis due to the inexistence of a coherent dilution 

pattern; as well as fine gravel, because the results gave an advection velocity almost null and a 

diffusion coefficient one order of magnitude higher than the ones found for the other grain-

sizes, which appears to be unrealistic and deserves further investigation. These results can be 

explained by the lower frequency of these particles in the tracer sediment (averaging 4 %) and 

their lower transport rates.  



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

114 

Very fine sand was also excluded because the laboratory grain-size analysis of tracer sediment 

indicate absence of these particles (Figure 5.18). The low percentages of very fine sand obtained 

from image analysis, should be an effect of particles overlapping, which is more problematic in 

the case of finer particles, because they tend to fall into spaces between the larger particles.

Equilibrium concentrations, advection velocities and diffusion coefficients used to fit the model 

are summarized in Table 5.1. The results show that sediment diffusion and advection velocity 

increase from the coarser to the finer particles. The average advection velocity and transport 

rates of the grain-size classes present similar values to those obtained based on overall tracer 

particle. This means that the velocity and volume of the sediment transport alongshore depend 

upon the relative amount of particles of each grain-size class within the entire distribution, 

which is in agreement with the observations performed by Komar (1977). On the other hand, 

this also means that grain-size classes with lower frequencies have little significance in the 

sediment transport rate. Thus, taking in account that Grande beach native sediment is 

essentially composed by very coarse, coarse and medium sand, a transport rate of 

8.15×10- 2  m3.s-1 was estimated based on the average rate of these three grain-size classes 

(Table 5.2).

Under the uncertainties related with the image analysis technique, which can led to an 

overestimation of the equilibrium concentrations, together with the fact that the concentration 

of each grain-size class was calibrated using the linear correlation obtained from standard 

concentrations containing all tracer particles, it was decided estimate the longshore drift using 

another approach and compare the results. 

Considering that the advection velocity obtained from the model depends on the concentration 

distribution patterns but, at same time, is independent of the concentration values, this 

characteristic can be used to estimate the transport rate independently. Therefore, the mean 

advection velocity estimated based on the three main grain-sizes classes of Grande beach was 

multiplied by the transport cross-sectional area, deduced by the thickness of the active layer 

measured along the beach profile and the width of the zone under the influence of breaking 

waves (see Figure 5.17 and Table 5.2). 

The estimated longshore transport rate was 7.99×10-2 m3.s-1, a magnitude similar to the 

previously estimated. However, the width of the transport section considered (beach face + low-

tide terrace) is wider compared to the narrow breaking zone, during the tracer experiment 

(beach face). This suggests that the longshore transport under spilling breakers (at the low-tide 

terrace) is lower than under plunging beakers (at the beach face), which can be explained by a 

smaller mixing depth induced by this breaking type. In the study case, mixing depth at the low-

tide terrace may even be overestimated due to the water in the mixing layer that difficult the 

measurement through the washers sinking. 

The longshore drift estimated using tracer data were also compared with the rate computed 

using Bagnold’s (1963) approach (Table 5.2). The rate obtained was 1.44×10-2 m3.s-1, which is 

5.5 times lower than the rates measured from the tracer experiment. This means that the 

dimensionless empirical coefficients (??) proposed Komar and Inman (1970) is not adequate to 

estimate the sediment transport under plunging breakers, in this case, the ?? obtained was 1.5. 

In fact, previous works carried out on the Portuguese reflective beaches reported that the 

longshore transport formulas tend to underestimate the total transport rate when applied to 

steep beaches under plunging breakers and that the differences between the two methods are 

usually one order of magnitude (Ciavola et al., 1997; Taborda et al., 1994; Silva et al., 2007).  

The ration between advection velocity and average longshore drift current was 0.028, similar to 

the ratios obtained in previous authors (0.021-0.024 in Ciavola et al., 1997; 0.017 in Taborda et 

al., 1994 and 0.010 in Silva et al., 2007), supporting the hypothesis that the high transport rates

are mostly linked with high cross-sectional area of the transport system, due to the high mixing 

depth observed in steep beaches under plunging breakers. 

 Selective sediment transport 

The grain-size analysis of the tracer particles show that coarser particles tend to concentrate at 

the lower beach face, while the finer ones are transported up to the upper beach face (Figure 

5.20B and Figure 5.22), suggesting a transport of the coarser particles towards offshore. 

However, the finer sediment found at the inner sandbar indicate that coarser particles are 

trapped at the base of the beach face. This observation is in agreement with previous works, 

which have been shown that sediment grain-size is generally coarser within the wave plunge 

point at the base of the beach face, decreasing both up to the foreshore slope and towards 

offshore, sometime with a second sediment coarsening at the offshore bar (see the synthesis 

about this subject in Komar, 1998). 

This sediment sorting can explain the absence of tracer in the sediment collected 400 m 

downdrift of the injection point at the inner sandbar, considering that sediment use to tracer 

had high percentages of coarse particles (&amp;lt;1 ?). 

The longshore variations, on the other hand, show a decrease of the tracer mean grain-size with 

distance to the injection point, which can be explained by the fact that finer particles remain 

longer in suspension and thus travel farther in a shorter time.  

The longshore transport rates estimated from the equilibrium concentrations increase from the 

very coarse to medium sand. In fact, several works have recognised the sediment grain-size 

effect on the magnitude of sediment transport, showing that an increase in the median 

grain- size will decrease longshore transport rates (e.g. del Valle et al., 1993; King, 2005). 

Komar (1977) observed an opposite behaviour in a tracer experiment carried out on a steep 

beach face (? = 8?) under plunging breakers (?? = 0.42 m; ? = 3.4 s; ?? = 27?), where the 

advection velocity decreased from the very coarse to medium sand with larger differences 

(between 3.1×102 and 0.6×102 m.s-1). The same author justifies that the finer grains swash high 

up the beach face, where they move alongshore more slowly than the coarser grains, which 

remain near the breaker zone and are transported by stronger longshore currents. However, his 

analysis was based on five sediment samples collected alongshore at the same elevation level, 

which limits the data interpretation and comparison. Still, even that finer particles remain longer 

at the same position, once entrained by waves, they can be transported, in suspension, for 

longer distances.

 Headland sediment bypassing 

Despite the northward longshore drift observed, Grande beach presented a morphology that 

was favourable to the HSB southward, i.e. a wider southern sector and a continuous inner 

sandbar along the Calhau do Corvo headland coast (Figure 5.28). 

This morphology should result from the previous incident wave condition that induced the 

beach clockwise rotation and HSB through the low-tide terrace, which is compatible with the 

enrichment of medium sand observed at Adraga beach and at the inner sandbar, compare to 

the berm and beach face sediment of Grande beach. 

As the HSB occurs at the low-tide terrace under spilling breakers, its magnitude should be lower 

than the longshore drift estimated from the tracer experiment under plunging breakers. Even 

so, a significant sediment volume can bypass the headland during a tide cycle, under low-energy 

wave conditions, considering the advection velocity of the tracer and the mixing depth observed 

at the low-tide terrace.

 LONG-TERM APPROACH 

 Methods 

The breaking wave conditions used to estimate potential longshore drift were obtained from 

the 56-years offshore wave time-series reconstructed by Dodet et al. (2010) that was presented 

in Figure 1.7 of Chapter 1. 

The offshore waves were propagated up to 15 m depth using the SWAN (Simulating Waves 

Nearshore) model, which is a spectral third-generation wave model developed by Delft 

University of Technology (Booij et al., 1999). The SWAN model was implemented using a 

bathymetry built based on three data sources: (1) European Marine Observation and Data 

Network (EMODnet) with a 428 m resolution, available online at: http://www.emodnet-

hydrography.eu/; (2) Instituto Hidrográfico with 250 m resolution, available online at: 

http://www.hidrografico.pt/download-gratuito.php; and (3) the LiDAR data provided by 

Direção-Geral do Território with 2 m resolution. The model computational domain was 

discretized by a rectangular grid with 89×189 km dimension and 500 m resolution. The 

boundary conditions were imposed by the mentioned 56-years wave time-series of integral 

parameters (wave significant height, peak period and peak direction) with a time interval of 6 

hours. The spectra shape was Jonswap, with a spectral directional resolution of 10°, while the 

discretization in the frequency-space was made using 31 intervals between 0.04 to 1 Hz. No 

currents, wind or tidal levels were used, therefore, nonlinear quadruplet wave interactions were 

disabled and a mean sea water level was considered. The model output parameters were 

significant wave height (??), mean absolute wave period (??01) and mean wave direction 

(???). 

For the period under analysis there is no wave data near to the coast to validate the model 

results. However, the validation results presented by Ribeiro (2013), for the SWAN model 

performance at the Portuguese west coast, showed a root mean square of 0.42 m for ?? and 9? 

for ???, consistent with the errors presented in other works for the Portuguese west coast (e.g. 

Rusu et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2009). This validation was performed with the data of an ADCP 

moored at 28 m depth north of Peniche. 

From 15 m depth to the breaking point, waves were propagated based on the wave linear theory 

and on the Snell law, using the Larson et al. (2010) approach to estimate breaking wave 

parameters.

The longshore drift induced by each wave was computed with the CERC formula proposed by 

Rosati et al. (2002), which relates longshore component of the energy flux at the breaking and 

the longshore sediment transport through the equation: 

 ? = ? (
???

16??
1
2(?? ? ?)(1 ? ?)

) ??
?

5
2sin (2?? ) (5.6) 

where ??  is the wave breaking criteria (0.78); ? is the sea water density (1025 kgm
-3); ??  is the 

quartz density (2650 kgm-3); ? is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 ms-2); ? is the assumed sand 

porosity (0.4); ??? is the wave significant height at breaking; ?? is the wave breaker angle, and 

? is an empirical coefficient (0.39, according to CERC, 1984). 

The longshore drift estimated corresponds to a potential value that should not correspond to 

the effective longshore drift considering the sediment starving observed in the studied coast. 

Under these circumstances, the use of the ? parameter estimated from the tracer experiment 

would not improve the results. However, the goal of this approach was to get insights on the net 

longshore drift patterns, which are independent of the transport magnitude.  

 Results 

 Breaking wave conditions 

The results show that breaking waves have a mean ?? between 1.5 and 2.3 m and a time-

averaged power between 11 and 27 k.Wm-1. For both parameters, the lowest values occur in 

the stretches sheltered by Carvoeiro and Roca headlands, as well as in the vicinity of Foz do 

Lizandro where an inflection in the coastline orientation is observed. In these stretches the ratio 

between nearshore and offshore wave power show a large wave power reduction. In the other 

stretches, ?? and wave power are higher and the ratio between nearshore and offshore wave 

power indicate a small wave power reduction, mainly in the vicinity of Lamporeira headland. 

Mean ??? and mean wave power direction are, in general, orthogonal to the coastline due to 

wave refraction (Figure 5.29).

direction and mean wave power direction are represented by the arrows orientation. 

 Potential net longshore drift 

The annual potential net drift is shown Figure 5.30; negative values correspond to a southward 

transport, while positive values correspond to a northward transport. The potential transport 

have lower magnitudes in the sectors NE-SW oriented, while the sectors NW-SE and N-S oriented 

present a higher potential transport. The sediment transport is preferably southward, however, 

in some circumscribed areas potential net drift is northward. The most notable cases are the 

stretches immediately north of the Consolação, Lampoeira, Roca and Raso headlands, where 

northward component show higher magnitudes and frequencies.  

The analysis of seasonal potential net drift show that the higher transport magnitudes occur 

during autumn (October-December) and winter (January – March) seasons. The asymmetry in 

the transport magnitude between sectors with different orientation, is higher during 

autumn/winter when compared to spring/summer seasons. Further, it can be noticed that at 

NW-SE stretches, the northward transport component is particularly significant during 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

124 

autumn/winter seasons. In the spring, the northward component weakens, and in the summer, 

rarely can counterweight the southward component (Figure 5.31).

 Discussion 

The magnitude of the potential net drift estimated, reach 2×107 m3.yr-1 at Lamporeira headland, 

one order of magnitude higher than the one estimated by Silva et al. (2012a),  for a NE-SW 

oriented coastal stretch located north of the studied site (Mondego cape – Nazaré headland). 

However, the sediment starving observed in the studied coast indicate that the effective net 

drift is significantly lower than the potential net drift. Moreover, as the goal of this analysis was 

to understand the transport patterns, is the relative alongshore variation that is relevant, a 

pattern that is independent of the absolute transport values. 

It should be noted that the potential net drift estimated in the vicinity of the Peniche peninsula 

is not consistent, considering the 500 m grid resolution used for the wave propagation 

modelling, which cannot properly represent the complex bottom morphology of this area. Thus, 

the wave refraction in this region should be greater and the potential net drift southward smaller 

than the estimated.  

The annual net drift put in evidence the role of Carvoeiro, Consolação, Lamporeira, Roca and 

Raso headlands as major boundaries in the transport pattern. In the N-S and NW-SE oriented 

stretches, south of these headlands, net transport is higher and permanently southward; while 

in the NE-SW oriented stretches, north of these headlands, the southward component weakens 

and is counterweighed by the northward one that reduces the net dominant drift. In some 

places, the aforementioned process can revert the direction of the net longshore drift (i.e. 

northward). The northward transport component reach its higher magnitudes in the vicinity of 

the headlands, weakening northward. The seasonal analysis shows that this pattern is induced 

by the high-energy autumn/winter waves. In the spring, on the other hand, due to the decline 

and clockwise rotation of wave energy, transport magnitudes decrease and the northward 

component of transport weakens, being overcame by the southward component in summer 

along almost the entire coast. 

The persistence of the southward longshore drift in summer, can led to a sand accumulation at 

the updrift (north) side of the headlands, as shown in Chapter 3, and sand bypass can occur. On 

the other hand, in the autumn/winter the opposite direction of the net drift in the both side of 

the headlands, inhibits the sand bypassing. This analysis confirms that nearshore sediment 

bypassing of the aforementioned headlands can only occur southwards, during summer low-

energy wave conditions. 

These longshore drift patterns justify the sandy and rocky nature of the inner continental shelf 

showed in Chapter 2. In the stretches N-S and NW-SE stretches the sediment is sweep southward 



Longshore Sediment Transport 

 

127 

by the high longshore transport rates, while in the NE-SW sectors the balance between south 

and north transport components, generates a sediment recirculation within these sectors, 

allowing sand to accumulate. 

 CONCLUSIONS 

The results presented in this chapter gave important insights on HSB processes. The presence of 

a continuous inner sandbar that crossed the tip of the Calhau do Corvo, suggests that HSB occurs 

at the low-tide terrace under spilling breakers, having a magnitude lower than longshore drift 

measured on the beach face, under plunging breakers. Notwithstanding, tracer advection 

velocity and the mixing depth measured at the low-tide terrace, suggest that a significant HSB 

can occur during one tide cycle, under low-energy wave conditions. 

The sediment sorting observed during the tracer experiment showed that coarser particles are 

trapped in the base of the beach face, while the finer ones are transported up to the upper 

beach face or, towards offshore, considering the finer sediment found in the low-tide terrace. 

Thus, the slightly enrichment of medium sand observed from the Grande beach to Adraga beach, 

is compatible with a selective HSB through the low-tide terrace. These results are in line with 

the results presented in the Chapter 4. 

The longshore transport patterns obtained from the potential net longshore drift suggest that 

studied coast can be segmented into four sediment circulation sub-cells: the northern one 

corresponds to the 3 km long beach-bay located between the Peniche peninsula and Consolação 

headland, while the other three are the macro scale embayments between Consolação, 

Lamporeira, Roca and Raso headlands. The opposite direction of the net longshore drift in the 

vicinity of the aforementioned headlands indicate that these boundaries only can be crossed in 

a single direction (southward), corresponding to gated boundaries. This behaviour can be 

explained considering that the net drift in the southern stretches is permanently southward 

directed, so all the sediment that bypass these headland cannot reverse its path.

Headland Sediment Bypassing and 
Shoreline Evolution 

 INTRODUCTION 

Headland sediment bypassing (HSB) is a key process in the headland-bay beaches development 

and evolution and, in this context, shoreline evolution modelling can be a useful tool. Several 

analytic and numerical models have been proposed to describe changes in shoreline based on 

analysis of the balance of sediment volumes over a certain time period, assuming an equilibrium 

beach profile (e.g. Pelnard-Considère, 1956; Hanson, 1989; Dabees and Kamphuis, 1998; 

Steetzel et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2004). These models are based on the assumption that the 

beach profile shape remains constant; the shoreward and seaward vertical limits of the profile 

are constant and there is an adequate sand supply, i.e. an infinite supply of sand is assumed 

(Thomas and Ashley, 2013). However, in headland-bay coasts as the study one, the equilibrium 

profile assumption up to the closure depth is not valid due to the sediment scarcity and to the 

presence of cliffs and rocky shore platforms.  

In this chapter a new shoreline evolution model – SEM-PLAT, developed to simulate shoreline 

changes on coastal stretches where beaches develop over a rocky platform, is presented and 

applied to understand the role of the HSB in the beaches development and evolution. 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes

SEM-PLAT model was applied to study, in particular, the HSB occurring in subaerial beach 

domain. This model was firstly applied to the stretch between Maçãs and Adraga (Taborda and 

Ribeiro, 2016), being now extended northwards up to Magoito beach (Figure 6.1). In the 

northern sector of this coastal stretch, beaches are a thin layer of sand that covers a rocky shore 

platform. The wide sand accumulation found in the north edge, results from the shelter 

promoted by the Magoito headland to the NW dominant waves; southward, narrow beaches 

are found at Aguda and Azenhas do Mar. In the southern sector, are the Maçãs and Adraga 

beaches, which usually present a well-developed berm and are located in fluvial stream mouths. 

Between the theses beaches, occur the Pequena and Grande beaches, the first one is usually 

narrow, while the second one present large variations, changing between a winter concave 

morphology and a summer well-developed berm.

 MODEL DESCRIPTION 

SEM-PLAT is a one-line numerical model for modelling shoreline evolution on platform beaches 

as the result of wave-driven longshore sediment transport. The model is based on the standard 

conservation of sand volume equation that governs most shoreline evolution models: 

  
??

??
+

??

??
= 0 (6.1) 

where ?  is the distance alongshore, ?  is the time, ?  is the longshore sediment transport rate 

and ? is the volume of the active profile. This equation shows that profile change rate (?? ??? ) 

is directly related to the alongshore gradients in longshore drift (?? ??? ).  

In finite difference form, the conservation of sediment mass for each coastal section can be 

expressed as: 

  ?? =
(?

??
? ?

???
)??

??
 (6.2) 

where ???  is the sediment that enters in a coastal section and ????  is the volume leaving the 

coastal section (Figure 6.2).  

 

Figure 6.2. Definition of standard conservation of sediment volume for shoreline change calculation in a 
control section. 

The equation (6.2) can be solved numerically, using finite difference methods over a discretized 

coastline domain knowing the longshore drift and boundary conditions. In the case of SEM-PLAT, 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

132 

an explicit method is used. In order to establish the convergence of the finite-difference 

approximation, the model uses an adaptative time step, i.e. the minimum time step between 

the value defined by the user and the value computed based on the courant condition 

(??????? ?????? = ???/??). By default the Courant number adopted by the model is 0.5. 

The model setting include the definition of the computational grid, profile model, offshore 

waves and boundary conditions. For each time step, a new shoreline is computed according to 

the flowchart presented in Figure 6.3. 

 

Figure 6.3. SEM-PLAT model flowchart.  

 Computational grid 

The computational grid is built from an initial shoreline, a coastline and a baseline (Figure 6.4). 

The shoreline (??, ?? ) corresponds to the beach berm crest and the coastline (?? , ?? ) to the cliff 

or dune foot. The baseline (?? , ?? ) is a reference line that can be curved and represents the 

trend of the shoreline, similar to the one proposed by Roelvink and Reniers (2012).  The main 

advantage of using a curved baseline is related to the possibility of modelling non-straight 

coastal stretches, as is generally the case of headland-bay coasts. The grid consists of ? cells 

defined by ? + 1 cell boundaries, with uniform or variable alongshore resolution. SEM-PLAT is 

based on a staggered grid where the shoreline positions (?? ) are defined at the center of the grid 

cells and, the longshore drift (?? ) and the azimuth of the normal to the shoreline (??) are 

defined at the cell boundaries. The left boundary is located at grid cell 1, and the right boundary 

is at cell ?.

Figure 6.4. Finite difference staggered grid, where (?? , ?? ) are the shoreline coordinates, (?? , ?? ) are the 
coastline coordinates, (?? , ??) are the baseline coordinates, ??  is th the distance between the baseline and 
shoreline (normal to the baseline), ?? is the longshore drift at cells boundaries and ??  is the azimuth of the 
normal to the shoreline. 

 Profile model 

SEM-PLAT profile model assumes a two dimensional profile cut in a hard rock substrate over 

which a sandy beach develops. The model is similar to the one proposed by Taborda and Ribeiro, 

(2015) where the beach overlays a flat, gently-sloping, shore platform. Beach profile is 

segmented in three domains: (1) a berm, (2) a beach face, and (3) a nearshore zone (Figure 6.5). 

The berm and beach face have constant slopes and the nearshore zone is based on the Dean’s 

equilibrium profile (see for example Dean et al., 2002), considering that at the origin of the 

Dean's profile, the slope is equal to the beach face slope. The theoretical profile extends up to a 

specified closure depth, however, the beach domain ends where the theoretical profile 

intercepts the shore platform. The model assumes that the rocky shore platform has a constant 

slope.

represent the positions of the coastline (??, ?? ); shoreline (?? , ?? ); beachface foot (???? , ???? ); beach end 

(???, ??? ); and shore platform origin/landward limit (???0, ???0). ??  is the berm slope; ??? is the beachface 

slope; ??? is the shore platform slope. 

 Boundary conditions 

SEM-PLAT allow two options for the boundary conditions: closed and open. If an open boundary 

condition is chosen, sediment is transported freely across the boundary (default boundary 

condition). When a closed boundary condition is specified, means no sediment is transported 

across the boundary. The sediment transport across the left and right boundaries are computed 

according to the flowing conditions: 

? If left boundary is open ?  ?(1) = ?(2); 

? If left boundary is closed ? ?(1) = 0; 

? If right boundary is open ? ?(????? + 1) = ?(?????) 

? If the right boundary is closed ? ?(????? + 1) = 0 

 Wave transformation 

Wave transformation is based on the wave linear theory and Snell’s law. Wave propagation from 

offshore to the closure depth (or other depth computed from a numerical wave propagation 

model) is computed considering a regional bathymetry, with an orientation that does not change 



Headland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution 

 

135 

in time.  From the defined depth to the breaking depth the transformation is performed 

considering (time varying) normal direction to the shoreline between adjacent cells (Figure 6.4). 

The propagation in this domain follows the explicit approach present in Larson et al. (2010) 

targeting to optimize the computation time. 

 Potential longshore drift 

The potential longshore sediment transport induced by the waves is computed using the CERC 

formula proposed by Rosati et al. (2002), represented by the equation (5.6), in the section 5.3.1 

of the previous chapter. 

 Effective longshore drift 

In headland-bay coasts the effective longshore drift is generally much lower than potential 

transport, because the magnitude of sediment distribution processes (potential longshore drift) 

is in general much larger than the sediment supply. The consideration of a sediment starving 

coast is a cornerstone of the SEM-PLAT model development. SEM-PLAT first computes longshore 

sediment transport rates along the coastal stretch assuming that there is no sediment deficit 

(potential longshore drift). Then, considering sediment availability, which depends not only on 

the sediment in cell but also on the updrift ones, it estimates effective longshore drift. To identify 

updrift cells, SEM-PLAT computes a sediment accumulation vector which is a cumulative count 

of the number of cells that naturally drains into each cell (analogous to the flow accumulation 

tool used in hydrology). After this, the model, sweeps the cells, from updrift to downdrift 

adjusting the longshore transport magnitude to the available sediment, according to the 

following conditions (Figure 6.6): 

(1) If the ?? computed is positive or negative and smaller than the initial volume of the cell, 

the effective transport at the cell boundary is equal to the potential transport.    

(2) If the ?? computed is negative and greater than the initial volume of the cell, the 

longshore transport magnitude at the cell boundaries must be adjust. In this case: 

?  if sediment leaves the cell through one boundary, the effective transport is the 

sum of the initial volume of the cell and the volume that enters in the cell; 

? if the sediment output occur through both cell boundaries, the effective 

transport at each boundary is 50% of the initial volume of the cell.

hypotetical potential longshore drift of 60 at each cell boundary and that left model boundary is closed and

 Beach profiles update and shoreline position 

For each time step, the sediment retained in each cell is redistributed within the beach profile 

according the following rules: 

(1) if the ?? is positive ? beach accrete and the sediment volume is added to the berm; 

(2) if the ?? is negative ? beach erode and the sediment volume is subtracted: 

? if ????? + ?? &gt;  0 ? berm retreat; 

? ????? + ?? &amp;lt; 0 and ?????? + ?? &gt;  0 ? berm obliteration and profile retreat 

from beach face; 

? if ?????? + ?? ?  0 ? complete obliteration of the beach profile. 

The shoreline position depends on the berm width, so when the berm is completely obliterated 

the shoreline evolution ceases although the beach profile can still change. 

 MODEL SETTING 

Model computational domain was extended from northern sector of Magoito beach to the mid 

of Adraga beach and discretized in 79 cells with approximately 100 m length (Figure 6.7). The 

coastline was defined as the base of the cliff for most of the domain, except at small stretches 

were the dune foot (Maçãs beach) or artificial structure foot (Grande beach) were considered. 

As the goal was the study of HSB occurring in the subaerial beach, the model was set to account 

the effective longshore drift occurring between the coastline and the elevation of – 1 m (MSL) 

that corresponds to the rocky shore platform elevation observed in the Magoito beach (see 

Chapter 3). The beach face slope (0.09) and berm crest elevation (4 m) were also chosen based 



Headland Sediment Bypassing and Shoreline Evolution

on mean values of the observed beach profiles. Berm and shore platform were considered 

horizontal (Figure 6.8).

Figure 6.8. Initial beach profile and shore platform profile along the entire study coast. 

Three simulations were conducted under constant wave forcing representative of the annual   

(?? = 2 m; ?? = 11 s and ??? = 308?), summer (?? = 1.4 m; ?? = 9 s and ??? = 314?) and winter 

(?? = 2.7 m; ?? = 12 s and ??? = 302?) time-averaged conditions, estimated from the hindcast 

wave time-series presented in Chapter 1 (Dodet et al., 2010). 

Taking into account the counter-clockwise rotation of the bathymetry observed near Magoito, 

which certainly influence the wave propagation, the offshore waves were propagated up to 5 m 

depth assuming the direction of this contour, i.e 281? near Magoito (cell 70 to 79) and 295? for 

the remaining domain. 

In the simulation S1 (annual), the initial shoreline corresponded to a hypothetical scenario 

where all the coast was fulfilled with a continuous beach extending for the entire domain, as 

shown in Figure 6.7. The northern boundary was set closed and the southern one open, allowing 

sediment leave the system until it reach the equilibrium. The simulation S2 (summer) starts from 

the shoreline position obtained from the simulation S1 and the boundary conditions were 

maintained; while the simulation S3 (winter) starts from shoreline position obtained from the 

simulation S2 and both boundaries were set closed to avoid that an unrealistic quantity of 

sediment get in the system through the southern boundary. The simulation S1 was conducted 

for a time-period of two years considering the large sediment volume in the system, while the 

other two correspond to a time-period of one year.

 MODEL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The model results for annual time-averaged wave conditions show a sand redistribution pattern 

in the southern sector close to the one observed in the Figure 6.1. In this sector the model was 

able to reproduce: 1) the shape of Grande beach, with a berm that is slightly wider at the 

southern sector; 2) the narrow berm of Pequena beach; and 3) the wider extent of Maçãs beach 

with a well-developed berm (Figure 6.10).

(??  = 1.4 m; ?? = 9 s; ??? = 314?) and winter (?? = 2.7 m; ?? = 12 s; ??? = 302?) wave conditions.  

In the case of the Adraga beach, the sand redistribution originated a beach narrower than the 

one observed in Figure 6.1, which can be related with the large rocky outcrops in the northern 

sector of this beach, affecting nearshore wave propagation and sediment retention that were 

not accounted by the model. 

In the northern sector, model results do not follow observations so closely. The model was able 

to reproduce the narrow beaches at Aguda and Azenhas do Mar, that mainly correspond to an 

intertidal domain, but in the case of Magoito, model do not match entirely with the 

observations, as the beach was reduce to a narrow face without berm (Figure 6.10). As shown 

in the Figure 6.1 and by the results of Magoito beach morphology presented in Chapter 3, 

beaches in this sector are characterized by a thin sand deposit covering the rocky shore platform 

that is often exposed. Under these circumstances, the local bathymetric changes related with

the shore platform can be a major factor that constrain nearshore wave propagation and sand 

retention. Despite the use of a different bathymetry direction close to Magoito, the irregularities 

of the shore platform can explain the poorest model results for this sector.  

The sand redistribution patterns for summer and winter time-averaged wave conditions are 

shown in the Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.12; while the respective beach profiles are presented and 

compared in the Figure 6.10.

In the case of model forced with a typical summer wave, sediment sweep along the northern 

coast was more pronounce when compared to the annual time-averaged conditions. The sand 

accumulations are almost imperceptible and are located in the most indented zones of the 

coastline. In the southern stretch, beaches show a retreat relatively to the annual time-averaged 

conditions. This retreat is more evident at Pequena beach and in the northern sector of Grande 

beach, where the berm was obliterated (Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.10). In latter cases, beach 

configuration closely matches the observed one in the satellite image obtained in the summer 

of 2014 (Figure 6.13A). This configuration with a larger berm in the southern sector of Grande 

beach and, the retreat at the northern sector and at Pequena beach, are compatible with beach 

planform rotation observed during the summer months (in Chapter 3).

Figure 6.13. Landsat 8 satellite images (provided by NASA and USGS) of the studied coastal stretch during: (A) 
summer (August 23rd 2013, tide level = -0.95 m (MSL)) and (B) winter (February 9th 2015, tidel level = -0.80 m 
(MSL)). The tide level at the time of the image acquisition was computed based on Cascais tide gauge data 
using the UTIDE model (Codiga, 2011). 

The model results for typical winter wave, show a berm retreat, mainly at Grande Beach, in 

agreement with the observed in the satellite image obtained in the winter of 2015 (Figure 

6.13B). The retreat of the southern sector of the Grande beach occurs in relation with the 

enlargement of its northern sector and the adjacent Pequena beach, which is in agreement with 

summer and winter Pequena beach profiles presented in Chapter 3 (Figure 3.24). The beach 

enlargement is mainly related with the intertidal zone (face and terrace) and can be also 

observed at Maçãs beach. In the case of Adraga, the model cannot reproduce the expected 

count clockwise rotation because the southern boundary was defined on this beach. Despite the 

northward longshore drift, the northern stretch present a sand distribution pattern similar to 

the one obtained for summer wave condition, corroborating the assumption that HSB north-

directed is more difficulty (Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.10).

These results are in agreement with beach planform rotation presented in Chapter 3 and with 

transport patterns obtained in Chapter 5, i.e. during summer low-energy wave conditions, the 

net sediment transport is southward, inducing a beach clockwise rotation; while during winter 

high-energy wave conditions, the net sediment transport is northward, inducing a counter 

clockwise beach rotation.   

 CONCLUSIONS  

SEM-PLAT model results are quite encouraging and suggest that it can be a useful tool to 

understand some key processes in headland-bay coasts such as HSB and beach rotation. 

The model results reproduced quite well the beach characteristics along the southern coastal 

stretch, putting in evidence sand redistribution as a major mechanism of beach development, 

where the HSB occurring in the subaerial beach seems to plays an important role. 

The poorest model results for the northern coastal stretch should be an effect of the local 

bathymetric changes related with the exposed shore platform (whose configuration was greatly 

simplified in the model) that constrain nearshore wave propagation. Moreover, the differences 

between model results and the observations can be also justified by the use of stationary wave 

conditions, which obviously is a simplification of the wave forcing.  

The planform beach rotation induced by the summer and winter time-averaged waves, indicate 

that seasonal (and interannual) changes in the incident wave climate can significantly affect the 

beach configuration or even its development, putting in evidence the delicate dynamic 

equilibrium of these beaches. This also means that the wave climate rotation (in relation to 

climate changes) can have strong impacts on evolution of these beaches.

Sediment Budget 

 INTRODUCTION 

Headland sediment bypassing (HSB) plays a major role in the definition of coastal sediment 

budget, particularly, on headland-bay coasts, as is the case of the coast between Carvoeiro and 

Raso capes. However, sediment budget of a littoral cell depends not only on the longshore 

sediment transport, but also on other sediment sources and sinks as schematized in Figure 7.1. 

The coastal stretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes has been considered as a single littoral 

cell of sediment circulation, assuming a negligible wave-driven HSB at north and south 

boundaries (Santos et al., 2014), which is supported by the geomorphological and 

sedimentological analysis presented in the Chapter 2 and by the distinct heavy mineral 

signatures found by Balsinha et al. (2010), in the fluvial streams and beaches located north and 

south of Carvoeiro cape. 

The sediment sources and sinks of the studied coast, found in literature, are summarized in 

Figure 7.2 and described below.  



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes

Figure 7.1. Schematic representation of the sedimentary sources and sinks of a littoral cell (adapted from van 
Rijn, 2010). 

The main sediment sources are the fluvial streams and the coastal erosion; the latter one should 

be mainly from cliffs, considering that these represent 81 % of the coastline (Marques et al., 

2013). 

The work presented by Lira et al. (2013), showed that the São Domingos, Alcabrichel, Sizandro 

and Lizandro rivers provide 37×103 m3.yr-1 of sediment, but only 10 to 40%  (i.e. 3.7×103 to 

14.8×103 m3.yr-1) of this sediment is compatible with the beach sediment. The sedimentary 

contribution of the smaller fluvial streams could not be discretised from the referred work, since 

that they were grouped with other small fluvial systems that do not drain to the study area.  

Andrade et al. (2009), Oliviera (2009) and Taborda et al. (2010), estimated both fluvial and cliff 

erosion contribution for the Sintra and Cascais coasts and, according to their results, sediment 

supply for the littoral downdrift of Foz do Lizandro does not exceed 6×103 m3.yr-1. 

The sediment supply from fluvial streams can be reduce due to dam’s construction, as is the 

case of São Domingos river. The study presented by Janardo (2016), showed that São Domingos 

dam’s reservoir is a very efficient trap for sand, interrupting its transport downstream. According 



 Sediment Budget 

 

147 

to this author, before the dam’s construction (started in 1988, as reported at: http://www.cm-

peniche.pt/, accessed Mar. 2017), sediment supply for the littoral was between 1.2×103 and 

2.7×103 m3.yr-1. Currently, sediment supply should be much lower, considering that 87 % of the 

sediment yield is capture by the dam.  

 

Figure 7.2. Main sediment sources and sinks of the studied coast based on previous works (values in 
×103  m3.yr-1).  

The sediment exchange of beach-dune systems, promoted by aeolian transport, is also a 

possible sediment source and sink as shown in Figure 7.1. However, beach-dune systems occupy

only 6 % of the studied coast (Marques et al., 2013), occurring near to stream mouths and 

presenting, in most of the cases, poor-developed dune fields. 

The larger dune fields are the Consolação and Guincho-Cresmina, located near the northern and 

southern limits of the studied coast, respectively. The first one is relatively stabilized by 

vegetation, while the second one, it is an active and extremely unstable system due to the 

constant drifting of sand particles. According to Rebêlo et al. (2002), the Guincho-Cresmina 

dunes belong to a vaster and complex dune system, known as the Guincho-Oitavos and classified 

as a headland bypass dune field. Guincho-Cesmina dunes should therefore considered a major  

sediment sink, while the sediment exchanges by aeolian transport of the other dune fields 

should have a small significance in the sediment budget of the studied coast. The aeolian 

transport at Guincho-Cresmina dune was estimated by Rebêlo et al. (2002), based on 

topographic data acquired between 2000 and 2001, with a magnitude of 14×103 m3.yr-1. For the 

same dune system and based on topographic maps and aerial images, Santos (2006) estimated 

an aeolian transport of 28×103 m3.yr-1, between 1974 and 1981, and 18×103 m3.yr-1, for the 

periods 1981-1990 and 1974-1990.    

At the northern boundary of the studied coast, aeolian sand transport is a possible sediment 

source, considering the proximity of the Baleal beach-dune system, located at the north side of 

the Peniche isthmus. However, currently, this should be reduced due to the urban structures on 

the isthmus. 

The cross-shore exchange between littoral and the continental shelf should be reduce and 

related with extreme storm events, but no reference about this subject was found for the 

studied area.  Also, there are no morphological evidence of submarine canyons on the studied 

inner shelf (Vanney and Mogenout, 1981; Badagola, 2008); therefore, there is no significant 

sediment losses for deeper continental shelf.  

The sediment retention related with the sea-level rise (SLR), is also a sediment loss that is not 

quantified for the study coast. 

According to the harbours dredging plan presented by LNEC (2010), Peniche and Ericeira 

harbours should capture, 30×103 m3.yr-1 and 2×103 m3.yr-1 of sediment, respectively, mainly 

composed by sand. More recently, Andrade et al. (2015) presented a value of 7×103 m3.yr-1 for 

the Ericeira harbour, based on information provided by DGRM (Direcção-Geral de Recursos 

Naturais, Segurança e Serviços Marítimos). LNEC (2010) refer that only two maintenance 

dredging operations at Peniche harbour were carried out in the period 2000-2010, 

corresponding to a sediment volume of 6.6×103 m3, dredged in 2004. In the case of Ericeira

harbour, one dredging was performed in 2003, but its volume is unknown. Despite the 

recommendations presented in this report for the use of the uncontaminated sediment dredged 

from the harbours in the beach nourishment, there is no information about the operations 

carried out in the Peniche harbour after 2010. In the case of Ericeira harbour, about 9×103 m3 

of sand were dredged in the last two years, which were used to nourish the Algodio beach 

located north of the harbour (personal communication of the Dr. Fernando Magalhães of the 

Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente). Based on this volumes the sediment capture of this harbour 

can be estimated in 4.5×103 m3.yr-1. 

The coastline evolution presented by Lira et al. (2016), based on foredune toe location observed 

from aerial images (1958-2010), suggest a non-significant long-term evolution for the coastal 

stretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes, compared to other sectors of the Portuguese 

western coast. The signal and magnitude of the changes are site-specific and the main trends 

observed were erosion at Consolação, north sector of Foz do Sizandro and Guincho (-0.49, -0.22 

and -0.65 ?0.2 m.yr-1), and accretion at Areia Branca, Santa Rita and south sector of Foz do 

Sizandro (+0.74, +1.06 and +0.23 ?0.2 m.yr-1, respectively). The other dune fields had changes 

that are within the method uncertainty (?0.2 m.yr-1). The authors concluded that the measured 

changes essentially reflect the coastal system’s natural variability, assuming that anthropogenic 

influence in sediment supply are negligible. 

The work presented by Carapuço (2016)5, based on historical postcards dated from the early 

20th century to the present, suggests that the western beaches of Cascais (i.e. Abano, Guincho 

and Cresmina beaches, located north of Raso cape) are relatively stable. This author assumes 

that shoreline changes are related with seasonal to interannual variations in oceanographic 

forcing, excluding a perceptible long-term trend. Furthermore, the photo-monitoring carried out 

by the same author at the same beaches, during approximately one year, illustrate well the 

seasonal changes occurring in these beaches. 

According to the longshore sediment transport patterns presented in Chapter 5, this coast can 

be segment into four sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consolação; (2) Consolação-Lamporeira; (3) 

Lamporeira-Roca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The main goal of this chapter is to define a comprehensive 

sediment budget for the studied coast and respective sub-cells, based on the main sediment 

sources and sinks identified (Figure 7.2) and, on the information obtained from previous 

chapters.

As existing information about the main sediment sources is spatially limited (i.e. is not available 

or discretize along the entire coast) and because estimates were obtained through different 

methods, new estimates are presented in this chapter. Moreover, the sediment loss related with 

the SLR and the long-term evolution of the studied beaches were also investigated. 

 METHODS 

 Estimation of sediment volume from cliff erosion 

The estimation of sediment volumes resulting from cliffs erosion was based on a historical 

inventory of cliff instabilities carried out by Penacho et al. (2013). This inventory was based on 

the comparison of aerial photographs covering the period between 1942-47 and 2010. The 

volume displaced (?) from each retreat movement detected was computed based on the mean 

cliff height (??), mean retreat of the cliff crest (???) and length of the affected cliff (?) available in 

the inventory, using the following expression: 

 ? = ?? × ? (7.1) 

where ??  is the affected cross-sectional area of cliff, assuming that cliffs have vertical faces and 

landslide as a triangular area: ?? = (?? × ???) 2? . According to Professor Fernando Marques of the 

University of Lisbon (personal communication) this approach can underestimate the volumes 

when landslides have cross-sectional areas with trapezoidal shapes or when cliffs present less 

steep faces, and overestimated volumes when landslide does not affect the entire cliff height. 

Nonetheless, the same author noted that most of the cliffs of the study area have very steep 

faces, therefore this approach can be considered acceptable. Sediment yield rates from cliff 

erosion were then computed by dividing the estimated volume by monitoring time period of 

each landslide event. 

 Estimation of sediment yield from watersheds 

Sediment yield from watersheds was estimated based on the soil erosion potential. Watersheds 

limits were defined based on the ASTER GEDM 2 digital elevation map (?30 m resolution), 

release in 2011 by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry – METI and U.S. National 

Aeronautics and Space Administration – NASA (available online at: 

https://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/, accessed Feb. 2013), using the Hydrology toolbox of ArcGIS 

software.

The soil erosion was estimated using an empirical model - Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 

(RUSLE) model (Renard et al., 1997), which is a revision and update of the widely used Universal 

Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). According to the RUSLE model, 

potential soil erosion is computed through the equation: 

 ? = ? × ? × ? × ? × ? × ? (7.2) 

where ? is the average soil loss (mass/area/year), ? is the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor, ? is 

the soil erodibility factor, ? is the slope length factor, ? is the slope steepness factor, ? is the 

cover-management factor, and ? is the support practices factor. 

For the present case study, the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor ? was extracted from the rainfall-

runoff erosivity map of the Atlas da Água, for precipitation episodes that have exceeded 

25.4  mm (available online at: http://sniamb.apambiente.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). 

The soil erodibility factor ? was obtained from Soil Map of Atlas do Ambiente, which follows the 

Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classification system (available 

online at: http://sniamb.apambiente.pt/, accessed Oct. 2015). The relation of the factor 

? values with the FAO classification follow the systematization proposed in Pimenta (1998) for 

the Portuguese territory. 

The cover-management factor ? was obtained from the CORINE Land Cover 2006 map (Caetano 

et al., 2009) (available online at: http://www.dgterritorio.pt, accessed Oct. 2015). The relations 

between ? values and the CORINE land cover level 1 classes follow the systematization proposed 

by Tomás and Coutinho (1993) for the Portuguese territory. 

To make the RUSLE model suitable at the catchment scale, ? and ? factors were merged into a 

single topographic factor (??) following the equation proposed by Mitasova et al. (1996, 2001), 

for computation of the factor at a point ? on a hillslope: 

 ??? = (? + 1) (
??

22.13
)

?

(
sin??

0.0896

?

 (7.3) 

where ??  is upslope contributing area per unit contour width (???? ???????????? × ???? ????), 

??  is the slope, and ? and ? are parameters for a specific prevailing type of flow and soil 

conditions. The variables ??  and ??  were computed based on digital terrain map used to limiting 

the watersheds areas (i.e. ASTER GEDM 2 with ?30 m resolution), while ? and ? were assumed 

equal to 0.4 and 1.3, respectively, following the work presented by Lira et al. (2013) for an area 

that includes the studied watersheds.

Finally, the ? factor was considered equal to 1 due to lack of information and impossibility of 

spatial discrimination (Cardoso, 1985; Lira et al., 2013). 

The transformation of soil erosion potential into sediment yield potential can be achieved by a 

multiplicative coefficient, known as Sedimentary Delivery Ratio (SDR). According to Cardoso 

(1985), when there are no objective measurements to determine a SDR coefficient, an empirical 

correlation between watershed area (??) and the SDR values proposed by Mitchell and 

Buzenzer (1980, in Cardoso, 1985) can be used. The correlation is given by the equation: 

 ??? = ?0.052 ln(?? ) + 0.374 (7.4) 

The sediment yield obtained in units of weight per year, were then converted into volumes, 

assuming a sediment dry unit weight. According to the relation between dry unit weight and the 

percentage of sand in the sediment accumulated in dam’s reservoirs, proposed by Lane and 

Koelzen (1943, in Sousa, 1995), and considering sand percentages obtained by Oliveira (2009) 

and Janardo (2016) for the sediment resulting from watersheds erosion, the dry unit weight 

should be between 11 and 15 kN.m-3, so a mean value of 13 kN.m-3 was assumed. 

Data integration and computation of sediment yield was made with the ArcGIS software, using 

the toolbox created by Lira et al. (2013) for this purpose.  

 Estimation of littoral sediment supply 

Littoral sediment supply corresponds to the sediment volume provided by the sediment sources 

that is compatible with beach systems. Considering the sandy nature of the studied beaches, 

sediment yield from watersheds and cliff erosion, useful for the littoral, should correspond 

approximately to the sand percentage in the total sediment yield. Thus, the quantification of the 

littoral sediment supply was based on grain-size compatibility factors between the sediment 

resulting from the erosion of the lithotypes that outcrop in the watersheds/cliffs and the beach 

sediment. 

The analysis of each lithotype to get grain-size compatibility factor is a heavy task and time 

consuming. Since it is not the scope of this work, the compatibility factors were chosen based 

on information found in the works of Oliveira (2009), for the Sintra’s watersheds, and Janardo 

(2016), for the São Domingos’ watershed (Peniche) (Table 7.1). 

According to the analysis presented by the authors mentioned above, the sand percentages of 

Jurassic and Cretaceous formations are quite variable due to the facies variation on limestones, 

marlstones and sandstones layers. Thus, sediment supply from these geological formations was 

estimated considering a range of values, between the minimum compatibility factor found for 



 Sediment Budget 

 

153 

the Jurassic-Cretaceous formations and the mean compatibility factor found for Jurassic 

superior formations, since these correspond to 70 % of the total area occupied by both Jurassic 

and Cretaceous formations.

The works mentioned above did not analysed the grain-size compatibility of volcanic sub-

volcanic rocks that also outcrop in the studied watersheds, as shown by the geological map 

presented in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.6). Basalts are the dominant lithotype and, according to 

analysis performed by Fedo et al. (2015), they can produce detrital material with 50 % of sand. 

However, this analysis was based on crushed basalt samples and did not account the strong 

chemical weathering affecting these rocks; thus, the sand percentage resulting from volcanic 

and sub-volcanic rocks should be lower, being assumed a compatibility factor of 0.25.  

The littoral sediment supply was computed by multiplying the volume of total sediment yield 

and the grain-size compatibility factor. In the cliff case, this is a direct relation since each mass 

movements affected only one of the geological formations defined in the Table 7.1. In the case 

of watersheds, the estimated volumes were adjust by a mean compatibility factor (??):

1.6);  ?? is the watershed area; ? is the number of lithotypes.

 Estimation of sediment retention related with the sea-level rise 

The sediment retention related with the SLR was estimated assuming some of the assumptions 

of the model proposed by Taborda and Ribeiro (2015) to estimate the impact of the SLR in 

platform beaches, which considers that headland-bay beaches are usually limited to the upper 

section of the profile and beach face is limited by a rocky shore platform. This model develops 

on the assumption that the beach profile (including berm elevation and face slope) is in 

equilibrium with mean sea-level (MSL) and wave climate. In response to sea- level rise, the 

model assumes that the profile will preserve the shape but the berm will be raised by the same 

amount as the rise in sea-level. If the system is assumed closed (i.e. beach volume is invariant) 

the thickness of sediment deposited over the berm must be compensated by the erosion of the 

beach face and landward migration of the berm crest. 

However, considering the results presented in previous chapters, the studied beaches are not 

closed systems and the sediment deposited over the berm must be compensated by the HSB. 

Under these conditions, the sediment volume retained by the berm rising can be estimated 

multiplying the beach berm area and SLR. The estimation was performed considering the SLR 

rate of 2.5 mm.yr-1, estimated by Antunes and Taborda (2009) for first decade of the 21st century. 

The berm area of each beach was computed from the beach length (presented in the Chapter 

3) and average beach width. The average beach width was estimated based on the distance 

between the berm crest line (S line, see section 3.2.2.1) and the coastline (i.e. dune, cliff or 

structure toe), using the Digital Shoreline Analysis v4.3 software (Thieler et al., 2009). 

 Historic and recent ground-photographs analysis 

Historic and recent ground-photographs were used to get insights on long-term beach evolution, 

through a simple comparison. Most of the historic images were extracted from the antique 

postcards website Delcampe (https://www.delcampe.net/), but also from the blogs Notícias de 

Colares (http://freguesiacolares.blogspot.pt/) and Rio das Maçãs 

(http://riodasmacas.blogspot.pt/). The images date is unknown in most of the cases, but the 

postmarks, on the back of the postcards, helped to constrain a minimum date. The recent 

photographs were acquired during the field work or kindly provided by colleagues. These images 

had as first intent the photo-monitoring of the studied beaches, therefore, camera location and 

direction angle are not exactly the same of the historic images. The image comparison was 

performed only for few beaches once it is very difficult to find historical photographs for the 

most of them. The beaches were Sta. Cruz, Baleia (Ericeira), Magoito, Maçãs, Grande and Adraga 

(see location in Figure 7.2).

 RESULTS  

 Sediment volume from cliff erosion 

The spatial distribution of the landslides identified by Penacho et al. (2013) shows that this are 

more frequent in the stretch between Consolação and Ericeira (60 %), but its magnitude is quite 

variable alongshore (Figure 7.3A). The sediment volume magnitude varies between 6.5 and 

1.8×105 m3, but only 22 % exceed 1×103 m3 (Figure 7.3B). For the period under analysis 

(1942- 2010), cliff erosion provided a total of 6.8×105 m3 of detrital material, which correspond 

to a sediment yield of 1.4×104 m3.yr-1.

 Sediment yield from watersheds  

Sediment yield from watersheds is shown in Figure 7.4, where smaller watersheds are 

represented in a single class – coastal streams, despite being independent water systems. On 

the whole, fluvial streams release 7×104 m3.yr-1 of sediment. Lizandro and Sizandro rivers are 

the main sources, with 14×103 and 12×103 m3.yr-1, respectively; followed by Alcabrichel 

(7×103  m3.yr-1), Grande (6×103 m3.yr-1), Safarujo (6×103 m3.yr-1), Cuco (5×103 m3.yr-1), Colares 

(4×103 m3.yr-1) and São Domingos (3×103 m3.yr-1). The coastal streams present individual values 

lower than 3×103 m3.yr-1, but together contribute with 12×103 m3.yr-1 of sediment.

factors assumed for the Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary formations. These values 

correspond to 19 and 40 % of the total sediment yield provided from both watersheds and cliff 

erosion (Figure 7.5A). The sediment contribution from watersheds was estimated between 

1.4×104 and 2.8×104 m3.yr-1, and is one order of magnitude higher than the one from cliff 

erosion (1.9×103 to 5.3×103 m3.yr-1) (Figure 7.5B).

 Long-term beach evolution 

Historic and recent photographs of the beaches are shown in Figure 7.6 and Figure 7.7. Most of 

historic photographs were acquired during the first half of 20th century, except in the case of 

Adraga, acquired in mid-50’s, and probably Magoito (prior to 1967). Despite the possible 

differences on tide level and wave conditions, the simple comparison of the historic and recent 

images shows that the general configuration of these beaches did not have significant change 

over the last century. The main differences observed are related with human development, such 

as the concrete wall of Grande beach and the small groin in the mid of Baleia beach.

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The comparison between historic and recent ground-photographs did not show any long-term 

trend, suggesting that the studied beaches are stable. The changes observed on the beaches can 

be explained by the seasonal and interannual wave variability, as shown by the beach 

morphological analysis and photo-monitoring (see Chapter 3). These observations are in 

agreement with coastline evolution of the short low-lying sandy stretches presented by Lira et 

al. (2016) and with the study of Carapuço (2016) in the western beaches of Cascais.

The sediment retention related with the SLR was estimated in 4.7×103 m3.yr-1 (for a berm area 

of 1.9×106 m2), one order of magnitude lower than the main sediment sources (1.6×104 to 

3.3×104 m3.yr-1). This added retention does not have significant impacts on the shoreline 

position, corroborating the assumption that HSB is the main driver of beach dynamics and 

evolution. However, considering the expected sea-level change scenarios in relation to climate 

change, is plausible that this sediment sink will have a greater impact on the sediment budget 

of this coast. 

The longshore sediment transport patterns presented in Chapter 5, showed that the studied 

coast is segment into four sub-cells: (1) Carvoeiro-Consolação; (2) Consolação-Lamporeira; (3) 

Lamporeira-Roca; and (4) Roca-Raso. The transport patterns also showed that the headlands 

that separate this sub-cell are gated boundaries, where the net HSB only occurs in the southward 

direction. 

The sediment supply provided by fluvial streams and cliff erosion and, the sediment retention 

related with the SLR of each sub-cell, are presented in Figure 7.8. It can be noticed that sub-cell 

3 receives between 9×103 and 1.7×104 m3.yr-1 of sediment (more than half of the sediment 

supply estimated for the entire coast), followed by sub-cell 2 with a sediment supply of 5.3×103 

to 1.3×104 m3.yr-1; while in the sub-cells 1 and 4, sediment supply do not exceed 2×103 m3.yr-1. 

Despite the larger source area of the sub-cell 1, sediment supply for the sub-cell 4 is higher, 

which should be the effect of the geology and geomorphology.

The results also show that sediment supply provided by fluvial streams is higher than the one 

provided by cliff erosion, mainly in the sub-cell 2 and 3, where the differences can reach one 

order of magnitude. It should also be noticed that sediment supply for the sub-cell 1 is provided 

almost in totality by fluvial stream and corresponds to the reference condition, taking into 

account the current sediment retention in São Domingos dam’s reservoir. 

The sediment loss related with the SLR have higher magnitudes in the sub-cell 2 

(2.6×103  m3.yr- 1) and sub-cell 3 (1.4×103 m3.yr-1) due to longer beach extensions (see Chapter 

3); while sub-cells 1 and 3 have sediment losses that do not exceed 500 m3.yr-1 (Figure 7.8). 

Based on the magnitude of the sediment sources and sink here presented and the ones obtained 

from previous studies, as well as on the information obtained in the previous chapters, a 

sediment budget for the studied littoral and its sub-cells is proposed (Figure 7.9): 

SUB-CELL 1 (CARVOEIRO - CONSOLAÇÃO) 

Considering that: (1) the Carvoeiro cape is a closed boundary, (2) the sediment bypass 

northward at Consolação cannot occur, and (3) most of the sediment provided from São 

Domingos river is retained in the dam’s reservoir, sediment supply for this cell is negligible. 

Sediment sinks of this sub-cell are the Peniche harbour with a magnitude of 3×104 m3.yr-1 

(LNEC, 2010) and the SLR that is two orders of magnitude lower (447 m3.yr-1).  

Under this scenario, this sub-cell presents a sediment deficit consistent with the erosive trend 

observed by Lira et al. (2016). However, the same authors considered that the coastline changes 

have a low magnitude that can be explained by the natural variability of the beach system. 

Notwithstanding, it was decided to confirm the compatibility of the eroded volumes with the 

sinks. The volume was estimated through a simple approach6, based on the LiDAR data of 2011 

provided by Direcção-Geral do Território and the data provide by Lira et al. (2016). The dune 

erosion rate obtained was 2.4×103 m3.yr-1, one order of magnitude lower than sediment sinks, 

suggesting that harbour sedimentation rate proposed by LNEC (2010) is overestimated. These 

dune erosion is more compatible with the sedimentation rate of 1.7×103 m3.yr-1 (estimated 

based on volume of the maintenance dredging presented by the same authors), or even with 

sediment loss related with the São Domingos dam (9×102 to 1.4×103 m3.yr-1). 

                                                           

6 The coastline position (dune toe) for 2011 and 2012 were computed assuming the retreat rate (0.49 m.yr-1) and the 

coastline position in 2010 (Lira et al., 2016). The projection of the coastline obtained for 2011 on the DTM acquired 
in the same year, coincides with the dune toe position observed from DTM (between 5 and 7 m elevations (MSL)). 
Thus, considering that dune toe is at least 5 m, a sand volume eroded between 2011 and 2012 was computed based 
on the DTM. 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

162 

The sediment deficit due to the source suppression, plus the weakening of the southward 

component of longshore drift due to the sheltered promoted by the Peniche peninsula to the 

dominant NW waves, suggests that southward sediment bypassing at Consolação headland is 

negligible and, this sub-cell can be assumed as a small closed system. Moreover, if the sediment 

dredged in the harbour since 2010, had been used to nourish the beach, the system should have 

be in equilibrium. 

SUB-CELL 2 (CONSOLAÇÃO – LAMPOREIRA) 

The main sediment sources of the sub-cell 2 are fluvial streams and cliff erosion (A ? 5.3×103 to 

1.3×104 m3.yr-1), given that HSB from updrift sub-cell and dune erosion are negligible. The 

sediment sinks are the sediment retention due to the SLR (B ? 2.6×103 m3.yr-1) and the 

Lamporeira sediment bypassing (A-B). 

SUB-CELL 3 (LAMPOREIRA – ROCA) 

Sediment sources of the sub-cell 3 are the HSB from the updrift sub-cell (A-B) and the fluvial 

streams and cliff erosion (C ? 8.6×103 to 1.7×104 m3.yr-1). The sediment sinks are the SLR 

(D  ?  1.4×103 m3.yr-1) and the Roca sediment bypassing (A-B+C-D), because according to the 

most recent information, the sediment captured by the Ericeira harbour (? 4.5×103 m3.yr-1) has 

been dredged and used in the nourishment of the updrift beach (Algodio beach). 

SUB-CELL 4 (ROCA – RASO) 

This sub-cell is supplied by the HSB from the updrift sub-cell (A-B+C-D) and by fluvial streams 

and cliff erosion (E ? 1.4×103 to 1.5×103 m3.yr-1). Considering that Raso cape is a closed 

boundary, the sediment sinks are the Guincho-Cresmina dune filed (F ? 1.4×104 to 

2.8×104 m3.yr-1; Rebêlo et al., 2002; Santos, 2006) and the SLR (G ? 353 m3.yr-1) that compared 

to the previous sink has low significance in the sediment budget (A-B+C-D+E-F-G). 

Under the previous assumptions and considering all the scenarios (i.e. maximums and minimum 

values) the sediment budget of this sub-cell varies between -2×104 and +1×104 m3.yr-1. This 

result is obviously conditioned by the uncertainties of the sediment sources and sink estimates, 

such as the uncertain related with resolution and temporal validity of the background 

information used in the RUSLE model; the simplification of the grain-size compatibility factors 

applied; and the interannual variability of the system, as for example, the aeolian transport rates 

estimated by Rebêlo et al. (2002) and Santos (2006) for different time-intervals. Nevertheless, 

the magnitude range of the Guincho sink is in agreement with magnitude range of the Roca 

sediment bypassing (? 1×104 to 3×104 m3.yr-1). 



 Sediment Budget

The sediment budget indicate that sediment sources balance the sinks and that this littoral is in 

equilibrium, which is supported by the long-term stability of the studied beaches. Furthermore, 

the results obtained also helped to define the magnitude of the net HSB at Lamporeira and Roca 

headlands, in the order of 104 m3.yr-1.

Synthesis and Conclusions 

 INTRODUCTION 

This thesis addresses the study of headland sediment bypassing (HSB) processes. These 

processes play an important role in the definition of the littoral sediment budget, having 

particular relevance on headland-bay coasts. However, headland-bay beaches research has 

been focus on the beach planform stability and rotation, since these beaches are generally 

regarded as fairly closed systems. On the other hand, although there are several references to 

the natural HSB in literature, few are those that focus on a detail description and 

conceptualization of these processes. For these reasons and taking into account that rocky 

coasts encompass more than half of the world’s coastline, the present study aimed to improve 

the current understanding of HSB. 

To archive this goal, the 100 km rocky coastal stretch between Carvoeiro and Raso capes, located 

at the Portuguese western coast, was chosen as a case study. This stretch includes headlands of 

several sizes and a set of beaches with variable length, orientation, embayment degree and 

exposure to the NW dominant waves. To identified and characterized the HSB processes 

occurring in this coast, it was fundamental to investigate depth, direction, frequency and 

magnitude of these processes, as well as the characteristics of the sediment that bypass the 

headlands. The research was based on morphological, sedimentological and oceanographic data

analyses, a tracer field experiment and processes modelling. The results obtained were also used 

to define the sediment budget of the studied coast, supported by the analyses of the sediment 

sources/sinks and the long-term change trends of the beaches. 

The HSB processes identified are presented in this chapter through conceptual models and, 

discussed considering the conceptual models described in the literature. This chapter includes 

also a discussion about the sedimentary dynamics of the study coast considering the results 

presented in the previous chapters, the general conclusions and the guidelines for further 

research. 

 CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING 

The literature review shows that currently there are three conceptual models to describe HSB: 

(1) the headland sandbar bypassing proposed by Short and Masselink (1999), which assumes 

that the seaward beach rotation results in a sub-aqueous sand wave along the headland coast 

that migrates downdrift and weld to the downdrift beach; (2) the sand strand bypassing 

described by Smith (2001), where sediment that bypass the headlands is transported across the 

downdrift embayment following a strand at an angle that depend on the null point of the wave 

refraction orthogonal; and (3) the model described by Storlazzi and Field (2000), in which beach 

sediment is carried outside the embayment by the strong offshore flows during major storm 

events, allowing it to be transported alongshore and feed the downdrift beach during low-

energy swells. 

In the studied coast, a process similar to the one presented by Short and Masselink (1999) was 

identified. It was observed that the persistence of NW, low-energy wave conditions, typical of 

the summer season, induced beach rotation. In the low-degree embayments, beach planform 

rotation resulted in a continuous inner sandbar along the headland coast that migrates 

downdrift and weld to the downdrift beach. However, beach rotation it is not necessarily related 

with low-energy waves, being the persistence of a wave direction the main trigger mechanism 

of this process. The shoreline evolution modelling demonstrates that this process is clearly 

dominated by the longshore drift, occurring mainly in the intertidal zone and, eventually, in very 

shallow depths of the inner shelf. As this process is typical of the subaerial beach domain, was 

named as Beach headland Sediment Bypassing (BSB) (Figure 8.1). The sedimentological data 

show that BSB is mainly related with coarse to medium sand. 



Synthesis and Conclusion

Figure 8.1. Conceptual model of the beach headland sediment bypassing (BSB): (A) initial condition; (B) beach 
rotation induced by a persistent wave direction and resulting inner sandbar; (C) merging of the inner sandbar 
with the downdrift beach; (D) slightly accretion of the downdrift beach. 

In the case of high-embayed beaches, the process described above cannot induce HSB, since the 

active beach profile does not reach the tip of the headland. In these cases, the results obtained 

suggest that sediment only can leave the embayment during high-energy wave conditions. 

During major storm events a severe beach erosion was observed, as result of the cross-shore 

sediment transport induced by strong seaward currents, in agreement with the Storlazzi and 

Field (2000) model. The sediment that leaves the embayment is then distributed on the inner 

shelf and eventually transported alongshore, bypassing the headlands. When wave energy start 

to diminish the sediment is slowly transported onshore and start to merge with downdrift 

beaches. This process is not exclusive of high-indented beaches and its frequency increases from

high- to low-degree embayment, i.e. as higher the embayment degree, the higher has to be the 

wave energy need to transport the sediment outside the bay. This HSB process is clearly 

triggered by the increase of wave energy and, depends on both cross- and longshore transport 

components, occurring at deeper waters, being named as inner Shelf headland Sediment 

Bypassing (SSB) (Figure 8.2). The spatial distribution of the inner shelf sedimentary deposits 

indicate that SSB is related with medium to fine sand. Although, during major storm events, the 

wave conditions can trigger an extremely effective selection process, as demonstrated by the 

large heavy mineral placer deposit observed at Grande beach, capable to transport coarser 

particles offshore.

beach erosion induced by the strong offshore flow during high-energy wave conditions; (C) sediment 
transport along the inner shelf; and (B) slow merge of the sediment that bypassed headland with the 
downdrift beach, during low-energy wave conditions. 



Synthesis and Conclusion 

 

169 

The model proposed by Smith (2001), is not necessarily a different HSB process, but a model 

that focus on the geometry of the HSB at the downdrift side. In fact, the sand strand described 

by this author, is compatible with the offshore sandbar, shallow attached sandbar or elongated 

spit observed by Short and Masselink (1999). However, as stated by Smith (2001), strand 

bypassing cannot develop when the seabed is sand starving and/or the downdrift beach is highly 

curve in plan, because the projection of the strand along the wave refraction orthogonal may be 

impossible. This means that geometry of the HSB depends on both, coastal geomorphology and 

sedimentary availability. In the studied coastal stretch it was noticed that, in the sandier 

stretches, HSB manifest itself through well-defined path, i.e. continuous inner or outer sandbars 

along the headland coast. However, in the rockier stretches, the sediment spread on the rocky 

platform, should be transported alongshore as thin, discontinuous and patchy sand bodies, as 

observed and described by Storlazzi and Field (2000) and Hume et al. (2000). 

 IMPLICATIONS OF THE HEADLAND SEDIMENT BYPASSING IN THE 

SEDIMENTARY DYNAMICS OF THE STUDY COASTAL STRETCH 

The results presented in the previous chapters show that studied coast is segmented in four sub-

sedimentary cell: (1) Carvoeiro-Consolação; (2) Consolação-Lamporeira; (3) Lamporeira-Roca; 

and (4) Roca-Raso. 

The first sub-cell comprises the beach located between Peniche harbour and Consolação 

headland, having particular characteristics due to shelter promoted by the Peniche peninsula to 

the NW dominant waves, which reduce significantly the longshore sediment transport 

southward. The magnitude of the sediment sources within this sub-cell is extremely reduced 

and the only sink is the Peniche harbour that should capture the sediment transported 

northward, during SW wave conditions.  According to the sediment budget defined, this sub-cell 

corresponds to a small closed system. 

The other three sub-cells are macro scale embayments, which have similar sedimentary 

dynamics. The northern sectors of these embayments have a NW-SE or N-S general orientation 

and the net longshore drift is southward for both winter and summer wave conditions. Thus, 

headlands in these sectors only can be crossed in a single direction (i.e. southward), 

independently of the HSB process. The southern sectors, on the other hand, have a NE-SW 

general orientation and the net longshore drift is southward, in the summer, and northward, in 

the winter. Considering the higher persistence of NW waves during summer, HSB should occur 

mainly through the BSB process. In winter, wave directional spreading is larger and wave energy

increases favouring the SSB. In low-indented beaches it is entirely possible that BSB and SSB 

occur simultaneously during storm conditions. However, the BSB northward is unlikely, 

considering the larger distances between the shoreline (beach berm) and the tip of the headland 

and the lower persistence of W and SW wave conditions. 

The coexistence of the two HSB processes in the low-indented coastal stretches suggest that 

they are decoupled. This assumption is also supported by the shoreline evolution modelling, 

which demonstrate that BSB is sufficient to justify the shoreline configuration of low-indented 

coastal stretches, suggesting that in this case BSB is the dominant process. Otherwise, the 

shoreline configuration modelled should be significantly different from the observed one.  

The balance between the longshore transport components within the southern sectors of the 

macro scale embayments, results in a sediment recirculation, which explains the sandy nature 

of inner shelf in these sectors. Otherwise, considering the lower magnitude of the sediment 

sources (in the order of  104 m3yr-1) compared to the longshore drift rate estimated based on 

the tracer experiment and numerical modelling (in the order of 106 m3yr-1), the inner shelf should 

be rocky, as the one in the northern stretches. 

The sediment accumulation observed on the inner shelf of the southern sectors (of the macro 

scale embayments), is a consequence of the sediment recirculation described before, suggesting 

that sediment can have a relatively long residence time inside these sub-cells. However, once 

sediment cross the sub-cell boundaries cannot reverse its movement, considering that at the 

downdrift side of the most prominent headlands the net longshore drift is permanently 

southward. The frequency of the sediment linkage between the sub-cells depend on the 

seasonal and interannual wave climate variability, as shown by the beach morphological 

analysis. The magnitude, on the other hand, depends on the balance between the sediment 

sources and sinks of each sub-cell and was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1. 

According to the previous considerations a conceptual model for sedimentary dynamics of the 

study site is proposed and presented in Figure 8.3. 



Synthesis and Conclusion 

 

171 

 

Figure 8.3. Conceptual model of the sedimentary dynamics for the studied coastal stretch. In the northern 
sectors, the sediment that leaves the embayments is sweeping southward, independently of the HSB process. 
In the southern sectors, the sediment is transported southward during the summer, bypassing the headlands 
through the BSB process, and northward, in the winter, though the SSB process (and eventually through the 
BSB).    

 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH  

The work carried out in the scope of this thesis contributes to the headland sediment bypassing 

research. The results obtained through several approaches allowed to classify dominant 

headland sediment bypassing processes in two main modes, which are in line with two of the 

existing conceptual models. The processes were classified according to the prevailing domain 



Headland Sediment Bypassing Processes 

 

172 

where sediment bypass the headlands as: 1) beach headland sediment bypassing (BSB) – a 

processes that takes place mainly at the subaerial section of the beach, and 2) inner shelf 

headland sediment bypassing (SSB) – a processes that occurs on the submarine domain. BSB is 

triggered by the persistence of incoming wave direction, is dominated by the longshore drift and 

is typical of low-indented coasts, where it plays a major role on the beach development and 

evolution. SSB is triggered by high-energy wave conditions, depend of both cross- and longshore 

transport components and can occur in both low- and high-indented coasts. This latter process 

is particularly important in the development and evolution of high-indented beaches, where it 

is the only headland sediment bypassing process possible.  

The sedimentological analysis and tracer experiment showed that headland sediment bypassing 

is a selective process. Coarser particles such gravel and very coarse sand tend to be trapped 

inside the embayments, being their bypassing very low or negligible. Coarse sand bypass occurs 

mainly in the subaerial beach, except during major storm events, when the wave energy triggers 

an extreme efficient selective process, transporting the lighter sediment particles offshore 

(including coarser sands), originating heavy mineral placer deposits. This selective process can 

generate large placer deposits due to a long-term enrichment in heavy mineral particles. In the 

case of medium sand particles, headland bypass can occur either subaerial beach or inner shelf 

domain, depend on the wave energy; while fine sand bypass should occur mainly in the inner 

shelf. 

SEM-PLAT model results showed that headland sediment bypassing plays an important role in 

the beach development and evolution and that, seasonal (and interannual) changes in the 

incident wave climate can significantly affect the beach configuration, putting in evidence the 

delicate dynamic equilibrium of these beaches.  Moreover, modelling also suggest that the 

exposed rocky shore platform can be a major factor in the wave propagation and, consequently, 

influence the beach configuration. 

The analysis of the sediment sources and sinks, long-term beach evolution, potential net 

longshore drift patterns and bypassing constrains, allowed to define the sediment budget and 

sedimentary dynamics along the studied coast. The results indicate that beach systems between 

Carvoeiro and Raso capes are currently in equilibrium. The magnitude of the sediment bypassing 

at the most prominent headlands that segment the coast, depends on the balance between the 

sediment sources and sinks of each sub-cell and was estimated in the order of 104 m3.yr-1; while 

its frequency depends on the seasonal and interannual wave variability. 



Synthesis and Conclusion 

 

173 

The linkage of the studied beaches, through the headland sediment bypassing processes, and 

their delicate dynamic equilibrium, indicate that climate changes can have strong impacts on 

their evolution, either through sediment retention induced by sea-level rise or changes in 

transport patterns due to wave climate rotation. 

The conclusions of this study are constrained by the available data, in time and space, mainly in 

what concerns to the inner shelf, where data acquisition was more difficult. While BSB was 

clearly defined and relatively well-understood, the description of SSB is based on several 

assumptions that deserve further clarification and validation. Thus, future research should be 

focused on the sedimentary transport along the inner shelf, including the exchanges with the 

beach.  

The modelling approach also deserves further development, as the SEM-PLAT is still focused on 

BSB. The model revealed as a useful tool in the study of BSB and beach rotation processes but it 

should be improved to account SSB. Furthermore, modelling approach can be also useful to 

forecast the impacts of climate changes, as well as in the management of headland-bay coastal 

stretches.

 Appendix B – SedPhoto2 toolbox 

The SedPhoto2 is a MATLAB class based on the SedPhoto class originally created by Rui Taborda, 

João Duarte and João Cascalho (in 2014) for detection and counting of fluorescent tracer 

particles on digital images of sediment acquired under ultraviolet (UV) light. SedPhoto2 is an 

updated version to detect and count tracer particles using images acquired under both UV and 

white (WT) light, avoiding problems related with the presence of shells particles that reflected 

in the same spectral range of tracer particles. Furthermore, a function to extract the threshold 

values of the tracer particles on L*a*b colour space was also add. 

This appendix includes the source code of the toolbox, examples of scripts using the toolbox and 

an example the tracer particles detection on images.
