Abstract

Migration of the endoprosthesis is defined as the misplacement of its initial fixation. To assess the migration, the position of the endoprosthesis 
regarding a certain anatomic region is verified. Considering the aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, the proximal area of reference is the origin 
of the lowest renal artery and, at the distal region, it is located next to the internal iliac arteries. Patients should be monitored for long periods so that 
migrations can be identified; these migrations usually occur 2 years after the implantation. To avoid migrations, mechanical forces that enable fixation 
and that are determined by the characteristics of the devices and by the incorporation of the endoprosthesis should predominate over gravitational 
and hemodynamic forces, which tend to drag the prosthesis toward to caudal direction. Angulation, extension, and diameter of the neck, and 
transversal measure of the aneurysmatic sac are important morphological aspects related to migration. In relation to the technique, endoprosthesis 
implantation with excessive oversizing (&gt; 30%) is not recommended because it leads to aortic neck dilatation, folds and proximal leakage that also 
contribute to migration. On the other hand, endoprosthesis with additional fixation devices (hooks, barbs and suprarenal fixation) seem to be less 
associated with migration. The process of endoprosthesis incorporation is partial and does not seem to be enough to prevent later migrations. In this 
sense, experimental studies with endoprosthesis of higher porosity, as well as the use of substances that allow higher fibroplasia and adherence of the 
prosthesis to the artery, have been conducted and are promising. Such aspects are discussed in the present review of the literature.

Resumo

A migração da endoprótese é complicação do tratamento endovascular definida como deslocamento da ancoragem inicial. Para avaliação da migração, 
verifica-se a posição da endoprótese em relação a determinada região anatômica. Considerando o aneurisma da aorta abdominal infrarrenal, a área 
proximal de referência consiste na origem da artéria renal mais baixa e, na região distal, situa-se nas artérias ilíacas internas. Os pacientes deverão ser 
monitorizados por longos períodos, a fim de serem identificadas migrações, visto que estas ocorrem normalmente após 2 anos de implante. Para evitar 
migrações, forças mecânicas que propiciam fixação, determinadas por características dos dispositivos e incorporação da endoprótese, devem predominar 
sobre forças gravitacionais e hemodinâmicas que tendem a arrastar a prótese no sentido caudal. Angulação, extensão e diâmetro do colo, além da 
medida transversa do saco aneurismático, são importantes aspectos morfológicos do aneurisma relacionados à migração. Com relação à técnica, não se 
recomenda implante de endopróteses com sobredimensionamento excessivo (&gt; 30%), por provocar dilatação do colo do aneurisma, além de dobras e 
vazamentos proximais que também contribuem para a migração. Por outro lado, endopróteses com mecanismos adicionais de fixação (ganchos, farpas e 
fixação suprarrenal) parecem apresentar menos migrações. O processo de incorporação das endopróteses ocorre parcialmente e parece não ser suficiente 
para impedir migrações tardias. Nesse sentido, estudos experimentais com endopróteses de maior porosidade e uso de substâncias que permitam maior 
fibroplasia e aderência da prótese à artéria vêm sendo realizados e parecem ser promissores. Esses aspectos serão discutidos nesta revisão.

Migration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al.J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, Nº 262

Introduction

Conventional treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
consists of placement of a polyester tube graft, the ends of 
which are sutured to the arterial wall proximally and distally 
to the aneurysmal dilatation, preventing blood flow from 
straining the wall of the aneurysm. Development of this tre-
atment modality was one of the finest achievements of vascu-
lar surgery, as it allowed modification of the natural history 
of the disease and reduction of rupture-associated mortality.1 
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR)2 
is based on insertion of an endoprosthetic device through the 
femoral or iliac artery. The device is then deployed within 
the lumen of the aorta so its ends are anchored to normal 
artery, proximally and distally to the aneurysm. After the 
sheath is released, the elasticity of the stent graft provides ra-
dial strength, which keeps the device fixated to the aneurysm 
neck. The endoluminally deployed stent thus excludes the 
aneurysmal sac from circulation. Some stents have hooks or 
barbs to improve fixation to the arterial wall.

EVAR is associated with decreased transfusion require-
ments and avoids aortic cross-clamping, decreasing cardiac 
overload and the untoward effects of ischemia and reper-
fusion, all of which contributes to allow shorter postope-
rative recovery times.3,4. However, long-term follow-up of 
patients undergoing EVAR shows a permanent risk of graft 
migration and structural failure, even when treatment was 
successful. Close surveillance is therefore required to detect 
any relevant changes and, sometimes, establish the need for 
reintervention.5-9 On the other hand, despite the need for 
continuous postoperative monitoring, EVAR carries the 
benefit of lower rupture-related death rates than with no 
treatment.10

Since the introduction of  EVAR, expectations on 
short-, medium- and long-term outcomes has run high. 
Ten years and countless studies on, the ideal endoprosthe-
tic device has yet to be developed. Despite progress in graft 
materials, endoprosthesis migration is still a major issue, as 
it may lead to type I endoleak and increased pressure wi-
thin the aneurysm, culminating in rupture or collapse of 
the device into the aneurysmal sac, both of which indicate 
emergent open repair.5,11

The present article will discuss the clinical and patho-
physiological factors involved in endograft migration. 

Definition and criteria

Endoprosthesis migration is defined as displace-
ment of the device from its original site of attachment. 

Assessment of migration consists of determining the 
position of the endoprosthesis relative to a predefined 
anatomical landmark. In infrarenal AAAs, the proximal 
landmark is the origin of the lowest renal artery, and the 
distal landmark is located next to the internal iliac arte-
ries. The landmark for suprarenal fixation is the superior 
mesenteric artery (SMA). CT scanning is the imaging 
modality of choice for assessment of adequate placement 
or migration. Slices no larger than 3 mm should be ob-
tained from the level of the SMA down to the common 
femoral arteries. The use of other anatomical landmarks, 
such as position of the vertebral bodies as observed on 
CT itself or on abdominal plain films, is unreliable, as 
any vertebral size changes due to osteoporosis or other 
bone conditions may lead to erroneous assessment of 
migration.12

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) defines endo-
graft migration as any displacement of 10 mm or more.13 
Caudal migration of the proximal stent is most common 
and poses the greatest risk in EVAR. The SVS definition is 
problematic in that, when the neck is small, 10 mm will cor-
respond nearly to its maximum length, and diagnosis may 
only occur after the patient develops complications. In light 
of these considerations, current practice is to regard any 
migration &gt;5 mm as clinically relevant.14

Regardless of endoprosthesis type, most migrations oc-
cur after the 13th month post-implantation, peaking at 19 
months.14-16 One key finding is that the risk of migration 
persists indefinitely after EVAR; complications have been 
reported as late as 4 years post-treatment. Follow-up studies 
seeking to assess graft migration must therefore extend for 
no less than 24 months after the procedure.

Although follow-up and observation for graft migration 
are essential, the absence of migration is no guarantee of treat-
ment success. In some cases, perigraft leak may occur despite 
adequate proximal fixation of the endoprosthesis, leading to 
expansion of the aneurysm. Therefore, proper device positio-
ning may only be interpreted as a positive treatment outcome 
if there are no perigraft leaks at the neck of the aneurysm.17-19

Current recommendations provide for CT follow-up at 
1 month and 6 months post-procedure and annually there-
after. If migration is present, follow-up intervals are shorte-
ned for closer surveillance.20 In some cases, arteriography 
(which allows endovascular repair if necessary) is indicated.

Importance of implantation technique

Implantation of the endograft body more distally than 
originally intended may be caused by erroneous operator

assessment due to parallax error, which is common in the 
tortuous aortic neck. Oblique views can minimize this issue 
and allow more accurate deployment.

Zarins et al.21 assessed the importance of proper 
placement of the AneuRx stent graft at the origin of the 
renal artery. Isolated review of this factor showed that 
graft deployment below the intended site was directly 
correlated with greater risk of migration. The authors 
established that the greater the distance from the renal 
artery to the proximal end of the graft, the greater the 
risk of migration; each millimeter increase in distance 
below the renal arteries increased risk of migration by 
5.8%. Likewise, each millimeter increase in length of the 
infrarenal neck covered by the graft decreased migration 
risk by 2.5%. Adequate placement of the distal end of the 
graft near the origin of the internal iliac arteries also cor-
relates with a lower incidence of migration, as it reduces 
the risk of distal leakage and allows better longitudinal 
columnar support for the endograft, which tends to pre-
vent proximal migration.14

Close attention to proper endograft placement at the 
proximal and distal neck of the aneurysm is therefore of the 
essence, as correct placement is positively correlated with 
lower risk of migration-related complications.

Biomechanical forces interacting with the device

Biomechanical forces produced by oversizing, the 
contact area between the device and the artery, and addi-
tional fixation such as hooks, barbs, or bare-metal supra-
renal support extensions encourage fixation of the device 
to the aorta, as does the inflammatory process that oc-
curs in the arterial wall.22 Conversely, gravitational pull 
and hemodynamics tend to drag the device caudally. The 
balance of these forces determines whether migration 
will occur. Complex calculations performed both in vi-
tro (in the biomechanics lab setting)23 and in vivo, with 
computational analysis of the CT results of patients who 
underwent EVAR,24,25 have provided important informa-
tion on the dynamic interactions between the aortic wall, 
the endoprosthesis, and blood flow. Several authors have 
adapted mathematical formulae to experimental models 
of abdominal aortic aneurysms before and after stent 
graft deployment. These studies have concluded that, 
even in technically successful cases, certain areas of the 
endoprosthesis will always be more sensitive to hemo-
dynamic changes, particularly at the aortic neck attach-
ment site and at the bifurcation of the iliac extensions. 
In these areas, the endograft wall is subjected to strain, 

producing a 1- to 2-newton drag force that pulls the de-
vice distally.

These findings created a need for better understan-
ding the forces involved in endograft fixation. Lambert et 
al.26 assessed the mechanical behavior of endoprostheses 
implanted in cadaveric aortas and found that, the greater 
the extent of prosthesis oversizing and the contact area 
between the device and the artery, the greater the load 
required to dislodge it. In similar experiments, Malina 
et al.27 found that hooks and barbs increase fixation even 
further. These studies have also provided important con-
tributions by identifying the load required for dislodging 
endografts (3 N on average) and comparing it with mean 
hemodynamic drag forces (2 N). Despite their validity, 
however, these investigations failed to take into account 
several factors that interact with endoprostheses in the 
living body, as all experimental testing was conducted in 
cadaveric aortas.

Proper graft fixation to the proximal neck also reduces 
the risk of migration. Wolf et al.18 reported a higher num-
ber of migration and type I endoleak events when there was 
poor apposition of the stent graft to the aortic wall. This is 
explained by decreased contact area and by leakage throu-
gh folds in the graft fabric, leading to reduced friction and 
fixation forces.

Distal fixation was investigated by Volodos et al.,28 who 
carried out in vitro assessment of straight and bifurcated 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts in a specially desig-
ned model: a plastic cylinder mimicking an aortic aneu-
rysm was connected to a pulsatile flow circuit powered by a 
cardiac pump, which subjected the system to different pres-
sures. The authors found only minor changes in diameter, 
but significant changes in graft length and distal kinking, 
culminating in displacement of the device when load ex-
ceeded 208 g (approximately 2 N), thus demonstrating the 
importance of distal fixation. In fact, the importance of 
proper distal fixation is proven by the high rate distal dis-
placement-related complications in patients receiving first-
generation endoprostheses, which lacked adequate stent 
support in the iliac regions. 

In addition to aneurysm- and endoprosthesis-re-
lated aspects, certain clinical changes may destabilize 
graft fixation forces and encourage migration. Mohan 
et al.29 studied 2,862 post-EVAR patients included in the 
EUROSTAR registry. Using Massey’s formula,30 the au-
thors analyzed significant (&gt; 5 mm) migrations of the 
proximal end of stent grafts and their correlation with 
clinical features, and found that smoking and hyperten-
sion were associated with increased risk of migration. 



Migration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al.J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, Nº 264

Smoking is an important determinant of aneurysmal 
wall dilatation, with an added harmful effect in weake-
ned arterial walls as a potentiator of protease activity.31-33 
Hypertension was significantly correlated with migra-
tion, as it increases the hemodynamic forces that push 
the graft caudally.

In short, an understanding of relevant biomechanical 
forces is a key element to be considered in the choice of 
endoprosthesis and EVAR technique.

Migration and device type

Table 1 shows differences in complication rates de-
pending on the type of endoprosthetic device. These com-
parisons must be viewed cautiously, as they represent the 
work of different teams with varying levels of experien-
ce in EVAR and patients with heterogeneous aneurysm 
characteristics.

Differences in migration rates may be explained by 
stent design – namely, by the choice of material used in 
graft construction and by mode of fixation. Resch et al.,34 
for instance, used Dacron-covered, Gianturco stent-based 
graft prototypes with proximal fixation hooks in most ca-
ses, whereas other authors used third-generation commer-
cial endografts, the design of which has been substantially 
perfected.14,16,21,22,35,36

The considerable variation in migration rates (1.8–
45%) also reflects differences in study criteria, such as 
length of follow-up, choice of technique and operator 
experience. 

Tonnensem et al.22 found lower migration rates after 
use of Zenith devices. However, the authors already had ex-
tensive EVAR experience when they began using this model 

of endoprosthesis, which may have biased their results. At 
any rate, mid- and long-term assessment studies appear to 
support lower migration rates with use of endoprostheses 
that employ auxiliary fixation systems.16 Longer follow-up 
studies should define whether this lower likelihood of mi-
gration is sustained over time.

Factors involved in migration

Aneurysm neck morphology

The shorter the length of the aneu  
rysm neck, the smaller the contact area between endo-
prosthesis and artery, thus hampering device fixation. 
There is no objective definition of the minimal area re-
quired for adequate fixation, but most authors empirically 
recommend a length of 15 mm.37

Aneurysm neck angle appears to influence duration 
of surgery and post-EVAR complication rates. Sternberg 
et al.38 measured aortic neck angulation (the angle formed 
between the aortic neck and the longitudinal axis of the 
aneurysm) and classified it as severe (? 70º), moderate (40 
to 59º) or mild (&amp;lt;40º). The authors found higher rates of 
complications (such as type I endoleak, aneurysm expan-
sion and graft migration), endovascular reintervention, and 
conversion to open repair in patients with severe aortic neck 
angulation. Furthermore, procedure duration was longer in 
these patients due to greater difficulty in endograft place-
ment. The authors concluded that EVAR should be discou-
raged in patients with aortic neck angles greater than 40º. 
Albertini et al.19 assessed the risk of proximal type I endo-
leak and migration and their correlation with aortic neck 
size, shape, and angulation. The authors found neck angle

to be the predominant factor associated with complications 
(Figure 1). Two major mechanisms explain this finding:
1) Tortuous proximal sites reduce the contact area betwe-

en the device and the arterial surface, decreasing fric-
tion, which tends to anchor the device;

2) Hemodynamic studies show that the force exerted by 
blood flow against the vessel wall at a single point is 
proportional to the square of the velocity of flow at that 
point. Thus, flow velocity is increased in tortuous ar-
teries, leading to increased drag forces. This, coupled 
with the fact that blood columns directly impact a lar-
ger surface of the kinked endoprosthesis, would increa-
se the likelihood of distal displacement even further.38,39

Some authors have reported the use of endopros-
theses in very large neck AAAs (&gt; 28 mm diameter) 
as a predisposing factor for graft migration; other stu-
dies, however, have found no such correlation.36 A gre-
ater likelihood of neck dilation 10 years after repair has 
also been reported when proximal cuff diameter at the 
time of EVAR exceeded 28 mm.40 Considering that pos-
toperative aneurysm neck expansion is a known pre-
disposing factor for migration and that large neck are 
more likely to expand, one may infer that endovascu-
lar repair of large neck aneurysms would be inherently 
complication-prone.14,41

Thrombi, calcification, and other irregularities of the 
aortic neck wall are also associated with poor endoprosthe-
sis fixation and increased likelihood of migration:
1) Thrombi found at the aneurysm neck have a friable 

surface, which decreases the area of friction between 
the device and the arterial wall;

2) Irregularities and calcification of the arterial wall lead 
to deformities or minor kinks and folds in the endo-
prosthesis. This reduces contact area, and type I endo-
leak may also occur through these points;28

3) Calcifications also harden the arterial wall, reducing 
complacency and decreasing device seating.

Aneurysm size and migration

Larger aneurysm size significantly correlates with 
parameters that predispose do endograft migration. 
Large aneurysms (&gt; 55 mm) tend to have shorter, wi-
der and more tortuous necks, which would thus incre-
ase the risk of migration.42,43 Ouriel et al.44 assessed 700 
patients according to aneurysm size, classified as small 
(&amp;lt;55 mm) or large (&gt; 55 mm), and found a statistically 
higher rate of migration and type I endoleak in the latter 
group. Aneurysms with smaller diameters were deemed 

more anatomically suitable for EVAR, which may explain 
the lower rate of complications in narrower aneurysms. 
In their five-year follow-up of 923 post-EVAR patients, 
Zarins et al.45 grouped aneurysm diameter into three size 
classes (small, &amp;lt;50 mm; medium, 50 to 59 mm; large, 
&gt; 60 mm) and found no significant differences in mi-
gration, leakage or aneurysm expansion rates. They did, 
however, report significantly higher rates of conversion 
to open repair and rupture-related mortality in patients 
with larger aneurysms. Interestingly, as conversion to 
open repair is usually prompted by leaks, migration or 
aneurysm expansion, higher conversion rates may corre-
late with these events.

Recent studies have shown improved outcomes and 
lower migration rates in patients with aneurysms smaller 
than 55 mm in diameter, which provide an anatomically 
favorable setting for EVAR.46 However, it bears noting 
that patients with small aneurysms undergoing purely 
clinical treatment aimed at controlling blood pressure 
have a low risk of rupture (0.6% per year). Indications 
for EVAR must therefore take life expectancy and risk 
of the endovascular procedure (and possible reinterven-
tion) into account.47

Oversizing and migration

Mohan et al.48 reported increased rates of type I endo-
leak when grafts were oversized less than 10%, and sugges-
ted 10 to 20% oversizing as adequate. Almeida &amp;amp; Yoshida49 
implanted 10- to 20%-oversized endografts in a swine 
aorta model. After 14 days, biomechanical assessment was 

Figura 1 - Medida do ângulo do colo do aneurisma segundo Sternberg et al.38



Migration of endoprosthesis - Almeida MJ et al.J Vasc Bras 2010, Vol. 9, Nº 266

conducted to ascertain the displacement load required 
to dislodge the device from the aorta. In the 20% over-
sizing group, displacement load was statistically higher 
than in the 10% oversizing group. This may be explained 
by the increased radial strength of the stent struts, which 
would penetrate the wall of the aorta and reach deeper 
into the tunica media. Some authors50 have posited that 
greater oversizing would produce a greater inflammatory 
response at the vessel wall, improving stent fixation and 
integration as well. In smaller vessels, such as the coronary 
arteries, greater oversizing would produce an even more 
intense inflammatory response, leading to intimal hyper-
plasia and early thrombosis.51,52 In larger arteries, however, 
greater inflammation would increase prosthesis fixation, 
preventing graft migration. Histological examinations 
carried out in the Almeida &amp;amp; Yoshida study corroborate 
results reported elsewhere in the literature, showing that 
a fibroblastic reaction, with attending inflammation and 
areas of neovascularization, occurred only in the 20% 
oversizing group.

However, weakness of the aneurysmal aortic wall must 
be taken into consideration;31-33 due to this factor, the addi-
tional strain of oversizing would produce a dilatation of the 
aortic neck over time.53,54 This trend has been proven by 
Sternberg et al.,36 who reported higher rates of type I en-
doleak and aneurysmal neck expansion in patients whose 
endografts were oversized more than 30%.

Excessive oversizing was also associated with worse 
aneurysmal sac outcomes, such as lower reduction rates 
and greater expansion, when compared with &amp;lt;30% graft 
oversizing. Migration rates are also higher, probably due to 
aneurysmal neck expansion. Schurink et al.17 carried out 
experimental studies of endograft implantation in an in 
vitro model using cadaveric aortic segments. After device 
deployment, the authors performed vascular ultrasound, 
angioscopy, angiography and CT scanning. Results showed 
a relationship between the presence of folds in the fabric 
and prostate diameter; the greater the degree of oversizing, 
the greater the number and size of graft fabric folds asso-
ciated with significant perigraft leaks. Although this par-
ticular experimental study used water as a substitute for 
blood, which may have led to overestimation of leakage, the 
untoward effects of excessive device oversizing were clearly 
established.

Endograft incorporation

As mentioned above, the immediate success of EVAR is 
due to mechanical forces acting on the endoprosthesis and 

aorta. However, incorporation of the endograft fabric to the 
arterial wall, producing a permanent hemostatic seal, is de-
sirable for medium- and long-term outcomes. The ability to 
obtain a healing process is absolutely critical in preventing 
migration and protecting against aneurysm rupture. Table 2 
lists some studies of endoprosthesis incorporation.

Tissue incorporation varies depending on the material 
from which the device is made. Past studies have shown 
that tissue incorporation of PTFE devices is poor as a con-
sequence of their hydrophobic surface, which would pose a 
limit to cell adhesion. Dacron-covered endografts have in-
termediate tissue incorporation capacity, whereas polyure-
thane devices induce a more intense inflammatory process 
and greater cell adhesion, which translate into better endo-
thelialization and fixation to adjacent tissues. Limiting their 
use, however, is the fact that polyurethane endoprosthesis 
are mechanically weak and tend to degenerate.55,56,59

Studies investigating endografts removed from pa-
tients’ bodies provide conflicting accounts of the tissue 
incorporation process. Some authors59,60 have reported a 
good endothelialization response and good fixation into 
the artery, while others have reported little graft adhesion 
to the vascular wall.55,56 These dissonant findings may be ex-
plained by differences in choice of material and by the low 
number of cases described in the literature. Furthermore, 
some patients mentioned in these reports had developed 
typical complications of EVAR, such as leakage or migra-
tion, which interfered with histological examination of the 
device. Analysis of uncomplicated grafts was thus limited 
to those removed from the small number of patients who 
died from non-EVAR-related causes, such as myocardial 
infarction or stroke,55-59 further decreasing the number of 
useful cases.

In animal experiments, the tissue incorporation pro-
cess has somewhat differed from that found in human 
studies. In swine and sheep – the most common animal 
models of endoprosthesis implantation – results were far 
more exuberant than those found in human studies due to 
interspecies differences. Furthermore, all experimental stu-
dies published in the literature were performed on normal 
arteries with none of the typical aortic wall changes, such 
as calcification and thrombi. Evidence suggests that inflam-
matory response and incorporation occur differently in the 
human aneurysmal aorta.60,61

In light of these results, studies assessing endografts after 
their removal from human patients and those conducted in 
animal models must be viewed and interpreted cautiously.

Medium- and long-term follow-up of EVAR patients 
has shown that risk of migration is permanent, and that

substantial complication rates persist for years after repair. 
These findings suggest that the tissue incorporation process 
occurs only partially and is not enough to prevent late com-
plications, such as endograft migration.

Future prospects

Several recent studies have been conducted with the 
purpose of developing endoprosthetic devices that heal bet-
ter into the arterial wall.62,63

Two basic factors prevent adequate tissue incor-
poration of stent grafts. The first is the use of PTFE or 
Dacron, which are inert materials and thus have little 
potential for tissue incorporation. The second is asso-
ciated with a peculiar characteristic of the aneurysmal 
wall: depletion and decreased resistance to apoptosis of 
myointimal cells, which play an essential role in tissue 
incorporation.62

Studies have been conducted with the aim of impro-
ving the tissue incorporation process by adding coatings

that could potentially stimulate cell adhesion and prolife-
ration, creating an environment conducive to the migra-
tion of fibroblasts and pluripotent smooth muscle cells. 
In addition to providing a more adequate microenviron-
ment, this strategy would improve collagen production by 
fibroblasts, decreasing rates of myointimal cell apoptosis. 
Lerouge et al.62 conducted tests using nitrogen-rich plas-
ma- and chondroitin sulfate-coated stent grafts and found 
increased adhesion of fibroblast and myointimal cell cul-
tures to these surfaces, as well as decreased apoptosis, as 
compared to controls. The chemical properties of Nitrile 
coated surfaces is believed to favor certain intracellular 
signaling pathways, modulating expression of integrin 
receptors, which are responsible for intercellular adhe-
sion. Integrins also activate the integrin-linked kinase 
and phosphatidylinositol pathways, which are believed to 
play a key role in inhibiting apoptosis. Chondroitin sulfate 
would decrease apoptosis by acting on a similar kinase pa-
thway (specifically, the P13K pathway). The authors con-
clude that the use of these substances may be an important 
option in manufacturing stent grafts with added capacity 
to incorporate into adjacent tissues.

Device porosity appears to influence the tissue incor-
poration process. Experimental studies suggest that, in 
lower-porosity grafts, the myointimal cells responsible for 
tissue ingrowth migrate from the ends of the graft and cover 
an intraluminal area of up to 20 mm. In microporous grafts, 
capillaries and vascular smooth muscle cells derived from 
the underlying granulation tissue have been found to pe-
netrate the pores present throughout the device, producing 
improved graft coating. Studies are currently underway to 
improve graft porosity and cell adhesion as a means of in-
creasing tissue incorporation.64

Van der Bas et al.63 implanted collagen- and fibro-
blast growth factor-soaked Dacron endografts in the 
porcine aorta and found significant improvement in 
tissue incorporation at 8 weeks post-implantation. The 
authors observed neointimal growth and, on immu-
nofluorescence studies, detected an increased number 
smooth muscle cells consistent with myofibroblast and 
myointimal cell proliferation. This study proved that in 
vivo induction of fibroplasia is possible, despite variables 
such as blood pressure and the blood flow effect, which 
were expected to “wash away” any substances impregna-
ted into the graft. 

Gene therapy studies are currently investigating al-
ternatives for improving the tissue incorporation process. 
Eton et al.65 implanted myointimal cells transduced with 
tissue plasminogen activator genes. Cells were suffused 

into a dual-layer Dacron endograft and implanted into 
dog aortas. According to the authors, grafts removed at 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 months were highly populated with gene-
tically modified smooth muscle cells, with increased t-PA 
antigen levels and t-PA activity, both of which were desi-
red outcomes of the transduction procedure. The authors 
concluded that endografts can serve as an important de-
livery vehicle for transduced cells. Although not its main 
objective, the Eton study revealed the possibility of indu-
cing greater fibroplasias by employing cells transduced 
with genes that increase proliferation of vascular smooth 
muscle cells or fibroblasts, leading to improved graft in-
corporation and fixation.

Almeida &amp;amp; Yoshida49 implanted Dacron-coated niti-
nol stent grafts in porcine thoracic aorta, applied fibrin 
glue to the interface between the graft and the endo-
thelium, and compared the results to a control group in 
which no fibril glue was used. On the 14th postopera-
tive day, biomechanical testing was conducted to mea-
sure the displacement load required for dislodging the 
device, as in the work of Malina et al.27 and Lambert et 
al.26 Displacement load was significantly increased in 
the fibrin glue group, and histological testing confirmed 
increased fibroplasia in the group. The authors conclu-
ded that application of fibrin glue to the endoprosthesis/
aorta interface may become an important step in impro-
ving graft adhesion and tissue incorporation to prevent 
migration. 

In conclusion, continuous improvement of endopros-
thetic devices has led to the development of improved 
materials, with greater wear resistance and reduced cross-
sections. Current progress is moving towards development 
of mesh coatings that improve tissue incorporation, so as 
to improve long-term results and prevent endograft migra-
tion, which is still a major hurdle to positive outcomes in 
EVAR.
