ABSTRACT
Stress is one of the major obstacles in frog culture and can be caused by factors such as inappropriate farming systems; 

inadequate management among other situations. The objective of the present study was to assess the hemogram, erythrogram and 
leukogram of bullfrogs (L. catesbeianus) when exposed to stress caused by different types of management: density and handling 
(manipulation), developed in the laboratory and repeated in the field for the appropriate comparisons in a experimental period of 
30 days. The density experiment was conducted with four treatments: 70 animals m-2 (D70); 100 animals m-2 (D100), Control; 150 
animals m-2 (D150) and 200 animals m-2 (D200), with 10, 14, 21 and 28 animals/box in the laboratory, respectively. Each treatment 
was performed with three simultaneous replicates. The handling experiment was conducted with three treatments: Treatment Without 
Handling (WH); Treatment with Partial Handling (PH) every 15 days and Treatment with Total Handling (TH) every 15 days. 
Each treatment was performed with four simultaneous replications. The methodology of the blood analysis followed international 
recommendations. In the present study we could observe that the animals of the field experiment did not reflect the same stress 
response observed in the laboratory in both experiment, which demonstrated the plasticity of these animals. 

Index terms: L. catesbeianus; density; handling; physiological response; hematology.

RESUMO
O estresse é um dos maiores obstáculos na criação de rãs e pode ser causado por fatores como sistemas de criação inapropriados; 

manejos inadequados bem como outras situações. O objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar o hemograma, eritrograma e o leucograma da 
rã-touro (L. catesbeianus) quando expostas ao estresse de diferentes manejos: adensamento e manipulação desenvolvidos no laboratório 
e repetidos no campo para as devidas comparações em um período experimental de 30 dias. O experimento de densidade foi conduzido 
com quatro tratamentos: 70 animais m-2 (D70); 100 animais m-2 (D100), Controle; 150 animais m-2 (D150) e 200 animais m-2 (D200) 
com respectivos 10, 14, 21 e 28 animais/caixa no laboratório. Cada tratamento foi realizado com três réplicas simultâneas. O experimento 
de triagem foi conduzido com três tratamentos: Tratamento Sem Triagem (ST); Tratamento com Triagem Parcial (TP) a cada 15 dias e 
Tratamento com Triagem Total (TT) a cada 15 dias. Cada tratamento foi realizado com quatro réplicas simultâneas. A metodologia das 
análises de sangue seguiu as recomendações internacionais. No presente estudo pode-se observar que os animais experimentados em campo 
não refletiram a mesma resposta de estresse observada no laboratório nos dois experimentos, o que conferiu a plasticidade destes animais. 

Termos para indexação: L. catesbeianus; densidade; manejo; resposta fisiológica; hematologia.

INTRODUCTION

Density is an extremely important factor for the 
quality of amphibians, Loman (2004), but it acts as a 
chronic stressor that may change the homeostasis of the 
animal (Hayes, 1997; Glennemeier; Denver, 2002; Rot-
Nikcevic; Denver; Wassersug, 2005). 

The handling, separation of animals according to 
their size to standardize the group contributes to animal 
welfare (Fontanello et al., 1993; Ferreira; Pimenta; 
Paiva-Neto, 2002), but it acts as an acute stressor and 

may as well change the homeostasis of them (Langkilde; 
Shine, 2006).

The hematological parameters represent an 
alternative method for the analysis of the effects of stress 
that cause quantitative and qualitative changes in the 
blood components (Wright, 2001; Allender; Fry, 2008). 
According to Rocha et al. (2010) and Teixeira et al. (2012), 
inadequate management act as a source of stress and can 
contribute to alterations in hemogram in Rana catesbeiana 
animals.

The hypothesis is that the density and handling 
alter the hematological parameters so the objective of the 
present study was to assess the hemogram, erythrogram 
and leukogram of bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) 
subjected to stress caused by these different types of 
management.

MATERIAL  AND  METHODS

In the density experiment at the laboratory, 219 
animals were used and placed initially in 40L propylene 
acclimation boxes (0.33 x 0.46 x 0.27m) for four days, 
and then they were measured and randomly distributed 
in propylene experimental boxes (0.47 x 0.30 x 0.17 m), 
which contained water only on the side of the pool. In the 
field, 1,560 animals were used, stocked initially in 140L 
propylene acclimation boxes (0.52 x 0.69 x 0.40m) for 
the same period, and then put in brickwork experimental 
boxes (1.10 x 0.77 x 0.80 m), slightly inclined so as 
to simulate a pool. In the handling experiment at the 
laboratory, 168 animals were used, stocked initially in 
the same 40L propylene acclimation boxes and then in 
the propylene experimental boxes. In the field, 1,200 
animals were used, placed initially in the same 40L 
propylene acclimation boxes and then in the brickwork 
experimental boxes.

The animals were fed extruded feed containing 40% 
crude protein, in an amount of 10% LW (live weight), once 
a day offered in trays, using fly larvae (Musca domestica) 
as a biological inducer. The water where the animals were 
kept in the laboratory was previously dechlorinated and 
changed daily very quickly, to disturb the animals as little 
as possible. In the field, the water of the farm reservoir 
was filtered by a system of stones and gravel in order to 
remove suspended solids. The change was performed by a 
system of elbows, with a continuous-flow water renewal. 
The photoperiod was 12:12, controlled by a timer and the 
mean air temperature was measured with a maximum and 
minimum thermometer. The mortality of the animals was 
recorded daily.

Blood samples were collected from the hindlimb 
vessel by puncture, with disposable and heparinized 
syringes and needles. Lidocaine at the concentration 
of…was used as local external anesthetic. The following 
analyses were performed: number of erythrocytes (RBC), 
counted in a Neubauer chamber using Hayem’s solution as 
diluent; hematocrit (Ht), using the microhematocrit method; 
hemoglobin rate (Hb), using the cyanometahemoglobin 
method; Total Leukocyte Count (TLC) and Differential 
Leukocyte Count (DLC), in blood smears stained by May-
Grünwald-Giemsa; and the absolute hematimetric indices 

were calculated: Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean 
Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) and Mean Corpuscular 
Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC).

Experiment of stress caused by density

P o s t m e t a m o r p h i c  b u l l f r o g  f r o g l e t s  ( L . 
catesbeianus) with mean weight of 13.83±3.37g were 
used in four treatments: 70 animals m-2 (D70); 100 animals 
m-2 (D100), (Control); 150 animals.m-2 (D150) and 200 
animals m-2 (D200), representing 10, 14, 21 and 28 
animals/box in the laboratory, respectively. Each treatment 
was performed with three simultaneous replications during 
an experimental period of 30 days. As the animals were 
removed for sampling, the internal space of the boxes 
was readjusted with a plastic fiber apparatus simulating 
a wall that was moved towards the pool so that the initial 
density was kept.

In the laboratory, two specimens from each 
replication (6 animals/treatment) were sampled on the 
15th and the 30th day of experiment, totalizing 48 animals. 
In the field, three specimens from each replication (9 
animals/treatment) were sampled at different collection 
times, totalizing 72 animals. 

Experiment of stress caused by handling

Bullfrog froglets (L. catesbeianus) with mean 
weight of 10.78±1.82g were used in three treatments: 
Treatment Without Handling (WH); Treatment with 
Partial Handling (PH) every 15 days and Treatment with 
Total Handling (TH) every 15 days. Each treatment was 
performed with four simultaneous replications during an 
experimental period of 30 days.

The treatment Without Handling (WH) was 
characterized by a process without manipulation. The 
treatment with Partial Handling (PH) consisted of the 
partial removal of the animals taking their size into 
account. In other words, the animals that were much 
larger or much smaller than the other ones from the same 
batch (around 10% of the animals) were removed and 
placed in buckets, 1 bucket/replication. Those animals 
were rearranged by size and put back into the boxes 
in order to keep the density. The treatment with Total 
Handling (TH) consisted of the total removal of the 
animals from the boxes and separation according to their 
size: small (S, 8 g), medium small (Ms, 10 g), medium 
large (Ml, 12 g) and large (L, 14 g) in different buckets, 
4 buckets/replication. Those animals were rearranged by 
size the same way and put back into the boxes keeping 
the density.

Both in the laboratory and in the field, three 
specimens from each replication (9 animals/treatment) 
were sampled on the 15th and the 30th day of experiment, 
totalizing 72 animals. The density used was 100 animals 
per square meter, corresponding to 14 animals/box in the 
laboratory. 

Statistical analysis

Tests were performed to verify the normality of 
data (Shapiro-Wilk and Bartlett) and the homogeneity of 
variances (F). The data of white cells were transformed 
into root (x+1), so as to meet those assumptions. The blood 
data were tested by the analysis of variance (ANOVA TWO 
WAY), followed by an a posteriori Tukey test in order to 
verify in what situations there were significant differences 
in the number of cells with regard to density and handling. 
The differences were considered as significant when 
p&amp;lt;0.05 (Zar, 1999). The statistical software used was 
STATISTICA (Statsoft).

RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION

Experiment of stress caused by density

The density of 100 animals per square meter (frogs 
up to 30 g) is recommended for froglets with regard to 
growth and survival in terms of cost-benefit in commercial 
production in a semi-dry system (Ferreira; Pimenta; Paiva-
Neto, 2002). According to Fontanello et al. (1993), animal 
size uniformity is represented by the combination between 
weight and length of the animal. 

On the 15th day, the animals were at the beginning 
of their growth, a stage where they are learning to eat, and 
due to their uniformity, the confrontations at this stage 
were considered light. On the 30th day, the animals were 
growing exponentially, with some of them developing 
faster than the others (i.e. nonuniformity), which in 
addition to the high voracity, made the confrontations 
more intense.

The animals in the beginning of the experiment 
showed number of erythrocytes: 351,000.00±9,669.54 
104mm-3; and the mean corpuscular volume:821.72±9.91 
fL. The erythrogram (Table 1), in the laboratory, on the 15th 
day, presented an increase in the number of erythrocytes 
and the mean corpuscular volume remained constant 
in the animals subjected to D200. On the other hand, a 
decrease in the number of erythrocytes was observed on 
the 30th day, but with increase in mean corpuscular volume, 
which suggested that throughout the experiment “young” 
red blood cells with larger volume were recruited to 
the blood system to give the necessary oxygen supply 

during the confrontations. The same way Teixeira et al. 
(2012) observed an increase in MCV in chronic stress 
with the same species. In field, on the 15th and 30th days, 
an increase in the number of erythrocytes was observed 
in the animals subjected to D200, but with decrease in the 
mean corpuscular volume, which suggested the presence 
of “mature” red blood cells with lower volume, a sign of 
no stress condition.

The animals in the beginning of experiment showed 
4,443.00±151.95 leukocyte total mm-3; 3,461.71±104.17 
lymphocytes mm-3; 120.51±12.51 neutrophils mm-3; 
759.17±105.72 basophils mm-3; 4.24±8.97 eosinophil 
mm-3; 11.65±8.29 monocytes mm-3. The leukogram 
(Table 2), in the laboratory, on the 15th day, presented 
small changes in almost all the leukocytes and a more 
expressive decrease in the monocytes in the animals 
subjected to D200. According to Martin et al. (2005) and 
Kiank et al. (2006), chronic stressors usually suppress the 
immune system changing the number of leukocytes. On 
the 30th day, a decrease in leukocytes and lymphocytes 
and increase in neutrophils, basophils and monocytes 
were observed, and the eosinophilic alteration was more 
expressive. High density may change the leukocyte 
profile, where increase stress presented changes in the 
population of circulating leukocytes, specifically with 
reduction in lymphocytes and increase in neutrophils 
in salamanders reared at high densities (Davis; Maerz, 
2009).

In field, on the 15th day, a decrease in the number 
of total leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils and 
increase in the other leukocytes were observed in the 
animals subjected to D200. On the other hand, an 
increase in the number of total leukocytes, lymphocytes 
and neutrophils, and decrease in the other cells were 
observed, on the 30th day, which suggested possible 
inflammation front of the signs of cannibalism in the 
smaller animals whose presents the head whitening, 
also known as “white head”. Davis (2009) reported that 
after stress condition the neutrophils, eosinophils and 
monocytes became more abundant, which means in this 
case understood as an inflammatory process.

Experiment of stress caused by handling

On the 15th day, the animals were growing 
exponentially, which in addition to the high voracity, 
made the confrontations more intense. However, on the 
30th day the animals were more used and conditioned to 
that situation, and due to their “uniformity” (Fontanello 
et al., 1993) the confrontations were lighter.

Laboratory Field



Hemogram of bullfrogs under... 159

Ciênc. Agrotec., Lavras, v.39, n.2, p.154-163, mar./abr., 2015

The animals in the beginning of the experiment 
showed number of erythrocytes: 362,777.+78±15,945.02 
104 mm-3; mean corpuscular volume: 412.88±28.58 fL. 
The erythrogram (Table 3), in the laboratory, on the 15th 
day, presented an increase in the number of erythrocytes 
and decrease in the mean corpuscular volume in the 
animals subjected to TH. The same way Rocha et al. 
(2010) observed an increase in the number of erythrocytes 
in acute stress with the same species. On the other hand, 
a decrease in the number of erythrocytes was observed, 
but the mean corpuscular volume remained constant on 
the 30th day.

In the field, on the 15th day, a decrease in the number 
of erythrocytes and the mean corpuscular volume were 
observed in the animals subjected to TH, and on the 30th 
day, decrease in the number of erythrocytes was observed, 
but the mean corpuscular volume remained constant. 

I t  i s  i m p o r t a n t  t o  p o i n t  o u t  h e r e  t h a t  t h e 
hematological approach for estimating stress is not 
as time-sensitive as direct hormonal sampling (Davis 
et al., 2008), where animals must be sampled within 
minutes of capture (Romero; Reed, 2005; Romero; 
Romero, 2002). In fact, in amphibians the time for 
the hematological effect of stress occurs on the order 
of hours to days (Bennett et al., 1972), which means 
that any potential effects of capture, handling, or 
transport are minimal if blood is obtained the “same” 
day of capture. The stress stimulus in the present 
experiment of handling was applied on the day before 
the collection, so there was not enough time for the 
blood cells to respond.

The animals in the beginning of experiment 
showed 14,417.41±849.64 leukocytes total mm-3; 
12,459.42±714.53 lymphocytes mm-3; 549.78±46.46 
n e u t r o p h i l s  m m - 3;  2 3 7 . 9 9 ± 6 6 . 6 6  b a s o p h i l s  m m -
3; 120.44±34.76 eosinophils mm -3; 139.69±42.26 
monocytes mm-3. The leukogram (Table 4), in the 
laboratory, on the 15th and 30th days, presented a 
decrease in the number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, 
neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes 
in the animals subjected to TH. Similar results 

were observed where acute stress caused decrease 
in the number of circulating lymphocytes (Maule; 
Vanderkooi, 1999).

In field, on the 15th day, a decrease in the number 
of leukocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils, 
and increase in the number of neutrophils and monocytes 
were observed in the animals subjected to TH. On the 
30th day, however, the animals exhibited an increase 
in the number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, 
neutrophils and monocytes, and decrease in the number 
of eosinophils were observed, which suggested possible 
inflammation front of the signs of cannibalism, even 
reduced by the manipulation. Increase in the number of 
neutrophils and decrease in the number of eosinophils 
were observed in R. pipiens exposed to the cold 
(Maniero; Carey, 1997), and in salamanders exposed 
to capture/“handling” (Davis; Maerzs, 2010) and in a 
challenge of R. catesbeiana with chytridio (Davis et al., 
2010). A decrease in the number of eosinophils were 
verified in trematode infection by Kiesecker (2002), 
Belden and Kiesecker (2005), Rohr, Schotthoefer and 
Raffel (2008). 

The nonuniformity of size in the animals from 
the highest densities was observed during the density 
experiment in the laboratory, showing a situation of 
territoriality between the largest animals and the smallest 
ones. However, there was neither mortality nor signs of 
cannibalism in the different treatments. In the field, the 
nonuniformity was generalized for all the treatments 
similarly, regardless of density, with signs of cannibalism 
and mortality. According to Cohen and Alford (1993) 
and Altwegg (2003), high density may cause reduction 
in the growth of the animal. On the other hand, in the 
handling experiment in the laboratory, uniformity of 
size was observed in the different treatments, which 
contributed to the absence of signs of cannibalism and 
mortality in the animals. Nevertheless, the nonuniformity 
was generalized in the field, even when the respective 
manipulation was performed, which contributed to the 
appearance of signs of cannibalism and mortality on the 
15th and 30th days.

CONCLUSIONS

In the present study it was possible to observe 
that the animals of the field experiment did not reflect 
the same stress response verified in the laboratory. Under 
stressful situations, animals use different combinations 
of defense responses to maintain homeostasis, which not 
only increase or decrease in the immune response occurs, 
but also redistribution of immune cells all over the body. 
Furthermore, the bullfrogs exhibit excellent capacity 
to adapt to the different climate regimes, as well as to 
the different types of management if compared to other 
aquatic organisms, which demonstrates the plasticity of 
these animals.
