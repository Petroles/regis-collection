Abstract: The Rosmaninhal area (Beira Baixa, Central Portugal) was mapped in detail. The lithostratigraphy of the Beiras Group (part of the
«Xisto-Grauváquico» Complex — CXG, Cambrian to upper Proterozoic in age) was established and allowed the mapping of folds and thrusts of
Sardic age (Cambrian to Ordovician), on which are superposed variscan folds and axial plane cleavage, producing interference patterns. It is propo
sed that the sardic deformation is due to dextral transpressive inversion of an aulacogene of upper Proterozoic to Cambrian age inside the Ibero
-Armorican Terrane.

Resumo: A área de Rosmaninhal (Beira Baixa, Portugal Central) foi cartografada em detalhe. A litoestratigrafia do Grupo das Beiras (parte
do Complexo Xisto-Grauváquico — CXG, com idade do Câmbrico ao Proterozóico superior) foi estabelecida, o que permitiu cartografar dobras e
cavalgamentos de idade sarda, entre o Ordovícico e Câmbrico, às quais são sobrepostas dobras variscas com clivagem de plano axial, produzindo
estruturas de interferência. Propomos que a deformação sarda é devida à inversão dum aulacógeno em regime de transpressão dextra do Proterozóico
superior ao Câmbrico no terreno Ibero-Armoricano.

INTRODUCTION

The present geological mapping study is part of
Research Project 1.2 of the Geological Survey of
Portugal «The Stratigraphy and Structural Study of
the Xisto-Grauváquico Complex-XGC»; it covers the
region of the Centro-Iberian Zone located near its SW
limit (LOTZE, 1945), N of the Tejo River and W of the
Erges River, being included in the so-called «Beiras
Group» (SILVA et ai., 1988).

The main geologic units present in the area are:
metasediments of the Beiras Group, included in the
«Douro-Beiras Supergroup» of Cambrian and Upper
Proterozoic age; quartzite, arenite and siate
(Armorican Quartzite Formation) of Lower
Ordovician age; continental sediments of Cenozoic
age and late-syntectonic variscan granitoid plutons.
Acid and basic dykes of pre-variscan and variscan age
(fig. 1) are also present.

The main structural features show clearly a sardic
deformation phase and superposed variscan orogenic

phases. The sardic phase generated upright folds with
axial trends towards 45°±15° and dominant vergence to
SE and, less frequently, to NW. The first variscan
phase (F1) is caracterizated by WNW-ESE trending
folds with associated penetrative vertical cleavage
subparalell to the axial planes of the folds.
Superposition of sardic and variscan folds (P1. 1, pho
to 1) originated type 1 and II interference patterns
(RAMSAY &amp;amp; HUBER, 1987).

The second variscan phase (F2) produced a flatter

~2 crenulation cleavage with NNW-SSE trend and
~&lt;pitch» to SE.

The late variscan phase is expressed by conjugate
NNE-SSW to ENE-WSW, sinistral and NNW-SSE to
NW-SW dextral systems. These systems are compati
ble with a N-S stress-field in the Upper Carboniferous
(RIBEIRO et ai., 1979). Subvertical «kink-bands» with

N-S to NNW-SSW trend and fractures with ESE
-WNW to E-W trend, filled by gabbro and microgab
bro are also observed. This brittle event was produced
by W-E maximum compressive stress, probably in the
Lower Permian.

LITHOSTRATIGRAFy OF THE BEIRAS
GROUP

The «Xisto-Grauváquico» Complex, also called
«Douro-Beiras Supergroup» of pre-Ordovician age, is
subdivided into the Douro Group (SousA, 1982) and
the Beiras Group (SILVA et ai., 1988 and ROMÃ0, in
press). Both groups are composed of flyschoid sequen
ces which are exposed in large areas of Northern
(Douro Group) and Central (Beiras Group) Portugal.

The Beiras Group in the Rosmaninhal-Moradal sec
tor has been recently subdivided from the bottom to
the top into the following units (R0MÃ0, 1990):

— Malpica do Tejo Formation: Thin (centimetric
to milimetric) bands of laminated pelite and siltstone
with occasional metric sized interbeds of greywacke,
in the lower member, and thick sequences of grey
wacke with pelite and siltstone intercalations in the
upper member. The lower member has a thickness of
at least 150-200 metres (base not seen) and the upper
one a thickness in excess of 1000 metres.

— Rosmaninhal Formation: Microconglomerates,
conglomerates and metric layers of greywacke interca
lated in a very thick pelitic sequence. This unit has a
thickness in excess of 1000 meters.

Almaceda Formation: A thick sequence made
up predominantly of greywacke with subordinate peli
te and bands of siltstone. This unit is lithologically
similar to the upper member of the Malpica do Tejo
Formatjon. The thickness of this unit is unknown,
because its top is not exposed in the mapped area, but
it should be in excess of 1000 meters.

Recently, SEQUEIRA (1991) has found acritarchs in
the upper part of the Beiras Group near the Cabeço das
Popas region, just north of our study area, which mdi-
cate a Middle to Upper Vendian age (Upper
Proterozoic).

The Armorjcan Quartzite Formation (Lower
Ordovician) is composed of quartzites with minor
intercalations of pelite; it rests unconformably on the

Beiras Group sediments. Between the Armorican
Quartzite Formation and the Beiras Group another unit
crops out. II is locally composed of conglomerate, are
nite, quartzite and volcanjcs, and has been given dife
rent names: Serra Gorda Formation (SEQUEIRA, 1991),
Envendos Formatjon (RIBEIRO et ai., 1991), Vale do
Grou Formation (SILvA ei’ ai., 1988) and «Série
Intercalar» (CONDE, 1971). This unit is conformable to
slightly unconformable with respect to the overlying
Armorican Quartzite and is strongly unconformable on
the Beiras Group.

REGIONAL STRUCTURE

In the study area, the Beiras Group has a general
structure with WNW-ESE trend and the Armorican
Quartzite Formation shows NW-SE trend; thus there is
an unconformity between both units (fig. 2). The
metasediments of the Beiras Group are deformed by
sardic and variscan phases and the Armorican
Quartzite only by variscan phases.

The Malhadio-Serrinha das Corgas Antiform and
the Rosmaninhal Synform represent first order
macroscopic structures. B oth structures were genera
ted by the interaction of the sardic upright folds with a
first order variscan anticline-syncline pair, with deve
lopment of axial plane cleavage (si). This interference
originates oscillation in the strike and dip of the limbs
of the major structures.

In the north limb of the Malhadio-Serrinha das
Corgas Antiform the normal succession is found, i. e.,
upper member of the Malpica do Tejo Formation over
Iam by the Rosmaninhal Formation, as we walk
towards the NNE. The south limb of the antiform is
reversed, dipping to the NNE except near the
Armorican Quartzite (rio Aravil area) where the suc
cession is normal, dipping to SSW. This antiform ver
ges to the NNW and its core becomes steeply plunging
when it crosses a sardic syncline, with subhorizontal
axis in the NE-SW direction, in the Pônsul river sector,
6 km W of Ladoeiro.

Adjacent to the 5 limb of the Malhadio-Serrinha
das Corgas Antiform is the N limb of the Monforte da
Beira-Rosmaninhal Synform defining everywhere a
reverse limb, dipping to the 5. Thus, the Monforte da
Beira-Rosmaninhal Synform shows, from E to W, both
limbs reversed or only the 5 limb reversed.

THE VALE DA MORENA AND BOIZANA
THRUSTS

Three exposures of the upper member of the
Malpica do Tejo Formation, contrasting by the predo
minance of the greywacke component with the sur
rounding sequences of mainly pelitic composition,
occur in the SE comer of the study area; we named
them the Fervedouro, Vale da Morena and Boizana
subdomains (fig. 1).

The Fervedouro structure is a brachyanticline gene
rated by the interference of a sardic anticline of long
wavelength, vergent to WNW, with shorter wave
length variscan folds (R0MÃ0, in press).

The Vale da Morena structure has a NW limb young
ing to NW; it corresponds to the envelope of a sardic
anticline cut by higher order variscan folds vergent to
the 5W. The SE limb shows that the younging to NW
Rosmaninhal Formation is dipping below the older
upper member of the Malpica do Tejo Formation, also
younging to NW. This is due to the presence of the
Vale da Morena thrust (fig. 3). This thrust is itself
affected by the variscan folds and cleavage, causing
highly variable dips in the thrust plane.

The Boizana structure is similar to the Vale da
Morena one, with the Boizana thrust carrying the
Malpica do Tejo upper member over the Rosmaninhal
Formation situated to the SW. Both thrust planes
duplicate the stratigraphic sequence from NW to SE.
Thrust indicators were defined in the Vale da Morena
thrust plane by quartz slickensides at the millimeter to
centimeter scale oriented N60-75W, 55-65 SE (P1. 1,
photo 2).

An outcrop of Malpica do Tejo greywacke situated
between the Vale da Morena and Boizana structures
correspond, probably, to a «Klippe» of the Vale da
Morena thrust but its geometry is ill defined due to
lack of exposure.

In these areas the L1(S1’~S0) intersection lineation
was systematically mapped at the 1:16 000 scale
(fig. 3). By drawing dip isogons of this lineation it is
possible to reconstruct the geometry of the sardic folds
(fig. 4). Looking at the isogon rnap we notice that in
the hangingwall of the Vale da Morena thrust the sar
dic axes strike NNE and in the footwall they strike
NE, being truncated by the thrust plane. This suggest
that the arnount of thrusting is increasing to SSW.

A schernatic block-diagram (fig. 5) of the Vale da
Morena thrust was constructed from outcrop data; it
shows clearly the truncation of the footwall beds by
the thrust plane and also some backfolding.

GEODYNAMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SARDIC
THRUST TECTONICS

The geodynamic significance of sardic thrust tecto
nics observed in the Rosmaninhal area can be analy
sed if we put it on the larger context of the Centro
-Iberian Zone of the Iberian Terrane (DALLMEYER &amp;amp;
MARTINEZ GARCIA, 1990) and in the even larger con
text of the Ibero-Armorican Arc, IAA (RIBEIRO, DIAS
&amp;amp; SILVA, in press).

In fact, some zones of the Iberian Terrane show a
palaeogeographic evolution rnarkedly similar to the
corresponding zones in Armorica. The more affine
zones seem to be the Centro-Iberia (CIZ) and Centro
-Armorican (CAZ) Zones that forrn the nucleous of
both variscan rnassifs. The palaeogeographic evolu
tion of both zones is very similar from Cambrian to
Devonian times (ROBARDET, 1976; YOUNG, 1990) and
new data (RABU et ai., 1990) show that Brioveran, for
rnely considered to be Upper Proterozoic in Britanny
but nevertheless very similar to the «Xisto
Grauváquico» Cornplex of CIZ, which is Cambrian
(REBELO &amp;amp; ROMANO, 1986) at least in the upper part,
is also post 540 MY in age. This is very important
because the sardic unconforrnity of CIZ, between
Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician is also present
in Armorica, with the sarne age, and has been pre
viously considered part of Cadomian cycle. We can
trace a belt affected by the sardic deformation phase,
disappearing to the inner side of the IAA and also,
probably, to the outer side of the IAA (fig. 6). What is
the geodynarnic significance of this deformation event
which produced thrusting and upright folding at high
angle to variscan grain in the CIZ (SILVA &amp;amp; RIBEIRO,
1985) and spectacular recumbent and upright folding
in the CAZ, also at high angle to the variscan grain?
At the sarne time in other zones on both sides the
deforrnation vanishes cornpletely (West-Asturian
Leonese Zone) or partially (Ossa Morena Zone) but
the palaeogeographic trend of the Carnbrian is nearly
parallel to the variscan grain. We propose the follow
ing rnodel, based on the comparison with transpressive

inversion of Upper Jurassic age in the High-Atlas
aulacogene (SCHAER, 1986).

The CIZ-CAZ correspond to an aulacogene inside
the Ibero-Armorican undisrupted Terrane that suffers
at 500 MY, a very early dextral transpressive inversion
(SILVA &amp;amp; RIBEIRO, 1985) with folding, bimodal mag
matisrn but no cleavage — except perhaps near some
local intrusions — and is later incorporated in the varis
can coilisional belt, since 390 MY. We can compare
the difference in age between the early inversion and
the beggining of coilision in the High Atlas (200 and
less than 100 MY, respectively) and in Iberia (500 and
less than 390, respectively) and see that they are of the
sarne order of magnitude. We conclude that the intra
cratonic sardic trough extended with no discontinuity
from Iberia to Armorica.
