Abstract

We analyse two problems in this work. In the first part we study the existence of solutions
to a semilinear elliptic equation in the whole space and with dependence on the gradient and
where no restriction is imposed on the behavior of the nonlinearity at infinity. We prove that
there exists a solution which is locally unique and inherits many of the symmetry properties
of the nonlinearity. Positivity and asymptotic behavior of the solution are also addressed.
Our results can be extended to other domains like half-space and exterior domains and also
to some fractional operators. For the second part, we analyse the asymptotic behavior of
solutions to the one dimensional fractional version of the porous medium equation introduced
by Caffarelli and Vázquez and where the pressure is obtained as the inverse of the fractional
Laplacian of the density. Due to the convexity of the kernel of the Riesz potential in one
dimension, we show that the entropy associated with the equation is displacement convex
and satisfies a functional inequality involving also entropy dissipation and the Euclidean
transport distance. An argument by approximation shows that this functional inequality is
enough to deduce the exponential convergence, in the entropy level, of solutions to the unique
steady state. A new interpolation inequality is also proved in order to obtain the exponential
decay also in ?? spaces.

Keywords: Semilinear elliptic equation; Existence of solutions; Asymptotic behavior of
solutions; Fractional Laplacian; Optimal Transport.

Resumo

Analisaremos dois problemas neste trabalho. Na primeira parte, estudaremos a existên-
cia de soluções para uma equação elíptica semilinear no espaço euclidiano todo e com de-
pendência do gradiente e onde nenhuma restrição é imposta sobre o comportamento da não
linearidade no infinito. Provaremos que existe uma solução que é localmente única e que
herda muitas das propriedades de simetria da não linearidade. A positividade da solução
e seu comportamento assintótico também são analisados. Os resultados obtidos também

podem ser estendidos para outros casos como o de domínios exteriores ou o semiespaço e
também para alguns operadores fracionários. Na segunda parte, analisaremos o comporta-
mento assintótico das soluções da versão fracionária unidimensional da equações de meios
porosos introduzida por Caffarelli e Vázquez e onde a pressão é obtida como a inversa do
laplaciano fracionário da densidade. Devido à convexidade do núcleo do potencial de Riesz
em dimensão um, mostraremos que a entropia associada à equação é displacement convex
e satisfaz uma desigualdade funcional envolvendo a dissipação da entropia e a distância de
transporte euclidiana. Um argumento por aproximação mostra que essa desigualdade fun-
cional é suficiente para deduzir que a entropia das soluções converge exponencialmente para a
entropia do estado estacionário. Também provaremos uma nova desigualdade de interpolação
que permitirá obter a convergência exponencial das soluções em espaços ??.

Keywords: Equações semilineares elípticas; Existência de soluções; Comportamento

Introduction

This work is devoted to the analysis of two different types of partial differential equations
involving nonlinearities which arise from many applications such as conformal geometry,
Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, stochastic control theory, long-range diffusive phenomena, con-
vective process and so on.

The first model which shall be studied in Chapter 1 is a semilinear elliptic equation where
no restriction is imposed on the behavior of the nonlinearity at infinity. More explicitly we
will study the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the following
nonlinear elliptic PDE:

?? + ?(?, ?, ??) = 0 in R? (0.0.1)
? ? 0 as |?| ? ?, (0.0.2)

with ? ? 3 and where ? : R? × R × R? ? R verifies ?(?, 0, 0) ?? 0 and belong to a large class
of nonlinear functions which include, for example, polynomial and exponential type growths
on ? or ??.

If on one hand the literature about problems with polynomial behavior is wide and very
well understood in many cases, on the other hand the same is not true for the exponential
case since many embedding results become hard to apply when dealing with this type of
nonlinearity, specially in this case where the domain is the whole space R?. And in spite
of this apparent lack of results, exponential-type nonlinearities appear naturally in many
contexts like, as said before, in geometry or in Chern-Simons gauge theory.

Nonlinear gradient terms also appear naturally in models connected with convective pro-
cesses, in the physical theory of growth and roughening of surfaces or in stochastic control
theory. These nonlinearities involving the gradient introduce new difficulties when combined
with unbounded domains and strong-growth nonlinearities, preventing the use of variational

1



and sub-super solutions methods, Ladyzenskaya-Ural’tseva conditions, Banach fixed point
theorem in Sobolev spaces, implicit function theorem, compactness arguments, and Leray-
Schauder theory, among others.

In smooth bounded domains ? ? R?, there is a rich literature for (0.0.1)-(0.0.2) with gen-
eral conditions on ?(?, ?, ??) for existence of solutions, including polynomial or exponential-
type growths. In this case existence results have been studied by means of different ap-
proaches involving the aforementioned arguments and techniques. For that matter, the reader
is referred to [5, 4, 36, 35, 50, 48, 66, 67] and their bibliographies. As pointed out in [35]
and [48], the use of techniques based on maximum principles in most cases imposes that the
nonlinearity grows at most quadratically in ??. This kind of restriction appears in the works
[5, 18, 40, 60], and was overcame in [68] for a logistic equation with |??|? with ? &gt; 1 and in
bounded domains by combining bifurcation methods and ? 1-a priori bounds.

For the case of explosive boundary conditions, that is ? ? ? as ? ? ?? (or as |?| ? ?),
existence of solutions for (0.0.1) have been addressed in bounded domains ? and in R? by
considering at most polynomial growth at infinity on the gradient ?? (see e.g. [2], [53],
and [42] in R?). For example, the authors of [42] assumed ??(?, ??) = ?1(?) ± ?2(??)
with increasing continuous ? and ? having at most power growth at infinity and ?(?, 0, 0) =
?1(0) = ?2(0) = 0. We also mention the work [3] for existence of distributional solutions in
R? with polynomial growth on both ? and ??, and without prescribing conditions on ? as
|?| ? ?.

Even when ? is independent of ??, the problem (0.0.1)-(0.0.2) in the whole space R?

with exponential-type growths on ? has been considered in dimension ? = 2 in the majority
of papers. Usually it is used Trudinger-Moser type inequalities and variational methods for
proving existence of solutions (see e.g. results of [82] with ? = 2 and its references). In the
case of bounded domains, a well known problem arises particularly when

?(?, ?, ??) = ?? (?)??, (0.0.3)

which was studied e.g. in [36, 65, 72, 80] (see also their references) with ? being a positive
bounded smooth function, where the parameter ? is assumed to be positive and sufficiently
small.

One of the goals of the work on chapter 1 is to provide existence results by using a
relatively simpler strategy but new for this prototypical situation. We will overcome this

2



problem on arbitrary growth at infinity and on the noncompactness of the domain by looking
for controlled solutions ? in the space ?? (defined on Section 1.2) which already have a good
decay in |?| and also in |??|. This choice on the space of functions is going to be enough to
prove that the functional associated with the nonlinearity ? is an operator on ??. A further
smallness condition is imposed on ?(?, ., .) in order to make the operator a contraction on a
subset of ??. The solution is then obtained as a fixed point of this operator. It is worthy
of note that this existence result is only local. There are no signs about when this solution
might be unique or about any kind of multiplicity.

Several symmetry and asymptotic behavior results are also addressed, showing that the
solutions inherit many of the properties of the nonlinearity ?.

This first part was done under the supervision of Prof. Lucas C. F. Ferreira and Prof.
Marcelo Montenegro at the State University of Campinas - Unicamp and was funded with
scholarships from Capes and CNPq. The results will also appear in [43].

The Chapter 2 is dedicated to the analysis of the long-time asymptotics of the nonlinear
nonlocal equation

??? = ? ·
(?
?(?(??)??? + ??)

)?

obtained from the fractional version of the porous medium equation introduced by Caffarelli
and Vázquez [20, 21]

?? ? = ? · (??(??)???) , (0.0.5)

by passing to self-similar variables.

The equation (0.0.5) is one of the two fractional variations of the classical porous medium
equation and the existence of solutions was first studied by Caffarelli and Vázquez in [20]. In
that work, the authors proved that whenever an initial data ?0 belongs to ?1(R?) ? ??(R?)
with the following decay:

0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| , for some ?, ? &gt; 0 , (0.0.6)

then there exist a weak solution ? such that ? ? ?([0, ?); ?1(R?)). The following other
properties were also obtained in [21, 20, 19]:

• The mass of any solution is preserved, i.e.,
??
R?

?(?, ?) ?? =
??
R?

?0(?) ?? , for all ? &gt; 0 ;

• Regularity: the weak solutions are ? ?(R?) for some ? &amp;lt;1;

• The sign is conserved: if ?0(?) &gt; 0 for all ? ? R? then ?(?, ?) &gt; 0 for all ? &gt; 0 and
? ? R?;

• The positivity is conserved: if ?0(?0) &gt; 0 for some ?0 then ?(?, ?0) &gt; 0 for all ? &gt; 0.

• Compactness of the support: if supp ?0 is compact then supp ?(?, .) is also compact
for all ? &gt; 0.

• Exponential decay: If ?0 satisfies the condition (0.0.6), then there exist a function
? = ?(?), which is increasing when 1/2 6 ? 6 1 and constant when 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2, such
that

?(?, ?) 6 ???(? )? ??|?| ;

• There exist constants ?, ?1 and ?2 depending on ? and ? such that

• Stationary solution: for each initial mass ? :=
??

?0(?)?? of the rescaled equation (0.0.4)
there exists only one stationary solution ??,?. This solution is ? 1?? with compact
support and the solution ?(?, ?) with ?(0, .) = ?0 satisfies

??(?, .) ? ??,???1 , ??(?, .) ? ??,???? ? 0 as ? ? ? .

• Asymptotic behavior: for each initial mass ? :=
??

?0(?)?? there exists a weak solution
?? (?, ?) of (0.0.5) such that, for every solution ?(?, ?) with ?(0, .) = ?0, we have

??(?, .) ? ?? (?, .)??1 ? 0 and ?
? ??(?, .) ? ?? (?, .)??? ? 0

as ? ? ?.

In spite of the asymptotic behavior given by the last two items above, no rate of conver-
gence was established for these results in [21] and thus, we shall show in the Chapter 2 that
in some cases we actually have an exponential decay for the difference ??(? ) ? ?? (? )??? and
??(?) ? ??,???? .

Due to the divergence structure of the equation (0.0.4), it is possible to identify its
solutions (at least when ? = 1) as gradient flows of the associate entropy ? on the space
?2(R) of probability measures when this one is equipped with the Wasserstein distance.
This idea was presented by Otto in [63] and has been extensively studied and used to obtain
quantitative and qualitative properties of solutions to equations of this kind. With respect
to long time behavior, there is two approaches which has appeared in the literature and both
take advantage of the entropy functional associated to the equation. In our case we can
define the entropy of a solution ? in the instant ? as

? (?(?)) =
1

??
R?

{?
(??)???(?, ?) + ?|?|2

?(?, ?) ?? ,

and its dissipation as

?(?) =

?? ,

It is known that rates of convergence for the functional ? lead to rates in some ?? spaces,
as one can see by results like Csiszár-Kullback-Pinsker Inequality and its variants. Thus, in
order to estimate the behavior of ? we can proceed in two ways: for the first one, known
as Bakry-Émery method and used in [8], we first note that, at least formally, for sufficiently
smooth solutions ? we have

?

??
(? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) = ??(?(?)) , (0.0.7)

and also
?

??
?(?(?)) = ?2??(?(?)) ? ?(?(?)) (0.0.8)

with ? &gt; 0. Therefore this last relation together with the Gronwall’s Inequality imply that

?(?(?)) 6 ?(?0)??2?? ,

5



and thus ?(?(?)) ? 0 as ? ? ?. Now, integrating (0.0.8) on [?, ?) and using (0.0.7) we
obtain

??(?(?)) =
?? ?

?

?

??
?(?(?)) ?? 6 ?2?

?? ?
?

?(?(?)) ??

= 2?
?? ?

?

?

??
? (?(?)) ?? = 2? (? (??,?) ? ? (?(?))) . (0.0.9)

i.e.,
? (?) ? ? (??,?) 6

1
2?

?(?). (0.0.10)

This inequality and the relation (0.0.7) imply

?

??
(? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) 6 ?2? (? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) (0.0.11)

and, by Gronwall again, we obtain that

? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?) 6 ??2?? (? (?0) ? ? (??,?)) .

Another way of obtaining this decay is trying to establish the inequality (0.0.10) directly
and so applying it to the relation (0.0.7) to obtain (0.0.11). This approach usually requires
less regularity from the solutions and can be done by optimal transportation methods since
what we want is a functional inequality for measures. In the Chapter 2 we shall use this
second approach and we shall obtain rigorously a generalized version of (0.0.10) for a good
set of measures in ?2(R) and apply it to the solutions of (0.0.4). The inequality (0.0.10)
appears in [21] as an open question about the spectral gap. We also prove that the decay in
the entropy level implies a rate of convergence of the solutions towards the stationary state
in some ?? spaces.

The inequality (0.0.10) is usually called, in the context of optimal transport, log-Sobolev
inequality in the linear diffusion case or generalized log-Sobolev inequalities otherwise. In
particular, it becomes the logarithmic Sobolev inequality [46] for linear Fokker-Planck equa-
tion [7, 28, 73], and a special family of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities for nonlinear Fokker-
Planck equations with porous medium type diffusion [37, 26, 29]. This inequality is closely
related with the notion of displacement convexity of functionals over ?2(R) which will be
defined and explored in the Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

All the results proved in this work about the rate of convergence of solution to (0.0.4) are

6



valid only in dimension 1. This restriction is due to the fact that we need to use the convexity
of the kernel ??,?|?|2???, used in the definition of (??)??, in order to obtain a generalized
version of the log-Sobolev inequality. It is worth of note to say that the problem of obtaining
any rate for the long-time asymptotic behavior of ?(?, .) is still an open problem.

This second work was done under the supervision of Prof. José A. Carrillo at Imperial
College London during a PhD Sandwich Program from Nov/2013 till Oct/2014 and was
funded with a Capes/Science Without Borders scholarship. The results will also appear in
[30].

Chapter 1

Semilinear elliptic equations in R?

with arbitrary growth

We analyse the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of the solutions to a nonlin-
ear elliptic equation in R? where the nonlinear term ?(?, ?, ??) can depend on the unknown
? and its first order derivatives ??. No restriction is imposed on the behavior of ? at infinity
except in the variable ?, and thus, our results cover nonlinearities with arbitrary growth in
? and ??, including in particular exponential type behavior. Using a fixed point argument
we obtain a solution ? that is locally unique, ? 1 and with polynomial decay which inherits
many of the symmetry properties of ?. Positivity and asymptotic behavior of the solution
are also addressed. The techniques, and even most of the arguments used in our results, can
also be applied to the case where the domain is the half-space or an exterior domain and also
to the case involving certain ranges of the fractional Laplacian.

1.1 Introduction

In this chapter we analyse the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of solutions
to the following nonlinear elliptic PDEs

?? + ?(?, ?, ??) = 0 in R? (1.1.1)
? ? 0 as |?| ? ?, (1.1.2)

8



with ? ? 3 and ? : R? × R × R? ? R verifying ?(?, 0, 0) ?? 0 and belonging to a large class of
nonlinear functions which include, for example, polynomial and exponential type growths on
? or ??. Since we are interested in ? depending on ? and ??, we write ?(?, ?, ?) for ? ? R,
? ? R? and the gradient of ? with respect to the (? + 1)-last variables will be denoted by
?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?). Throughout the paper, we frequently consider (1.1.1) with either ?(?, ?, ??),
?(?, ?, |??|), ?(?, |?|, ??), or ?(?, |?|, |??|) with the same hypotheses on ?, except for the
symmetry results.

Exponential-type nonlinearities appear naturally in many contexts like: conformal ge-
ometry and the prescribed curvature problem in 2 dimensions, where one is interested on
determining the class of functions ? : ? ? R on the manifold ? with curvature ? such
that the problem

??? = ??2? + ? , on ? ,

admits a solution and hence, this solution leads to metric on ? which is pointwise conformal
to the original one and has ? as its Gaussian curvature (see [34], [33], [49]); condensate
or multivortex solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory, where one is
interested on the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the equation

?? =
4
?2

??(?? ? 1) + 4?
???

?=1
?? , on R2/Z × Z ,

where ? is a constant called Chern-Simons coupling parameter and ?? are the Dirac measures
at the prescribed zeros ?? of the Higgs scalar (see [22, 31, 71, 75]);

On the other hand, nonlinear gradient terms appear naturally in models connected with
convective processes, in the physical theory of growth and roughening of surfaces or in stochas-
tic control theory. One of the most widely studied examples is the following equation

??? = ?(?)|??|2 + ?? (?) , on R? , (1.1.3)

where ? &gt; 0, ? is a positive continuous function and ? is a positive measurable one. The
parabolic version of this equation was proposed by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang in [47] as a
model for the evolution of the profile of a growing interface, which appears in the growth of
smoke, flame fronts or tumors,

??? = ??? + ?|??|2 + ? (?) .

9



Also, for suitable choices of ? and ? , one can view (1.1.3) as the equation for the stationary
states of the following model

??? = ??? + |??|2

which is the viscosity approximation of some Hamilton-Jabobi type equations (see the stan-
dard reference [58]). The classical references in the treatment of (1.1.3) are [55] and [51],
while many other results in that direction were also obtained by L. Boccardo, F. Murat, A.
Porreta, J.-P. Puel and others.

As we said in the Introduction, the combination of the exponential growth, gradient terms
and noncompact domains let the problem very hard to handle with standard methods since
the natural spaces where they look for solutions are ?? spaces and generalizations. Here we
will overcome all these difficulties by searching for solutions in a space where the functions
have an polynomial decay which will be enough to control the nonlinearity.

The organization of this chapter is as follows. We first present an integral equivalent
form for the problem (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) in the Section 1.2 together with the spaces where we
shall look for the solutions. Due to this integral formulation, we need to prove some lemmas
about convolutions and regularity of the Newtonian potential that will be used in the proof
of the main theorem. On Section 1.3 we state our main result and we prove it by using
a fixed point argument in the spaces defined on section 1.2. Two concrete examples where
our hypothesis are satisfied are presented, and finally we show that the solutions obtained
for this method inherit many of the properties of the nonlinearity ?, like the positivity and
symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of ? and its gradient. It is worthy of note to
point out that by slight modifications on the proofs, our approach can be employed for other
unbounded domains like half-space and exterior domains, with either Dirichlet or Neumann
homogeneous boundary conditions.

1.2 Integral Formulation, Lemmas and Known Results

This section we present the integral formulation, using Green’s function, which will be
used to prove the existence of solution to (1.1.1)-(1.1.2). We shall also prove some Lemmas
about the Newtonian potential on the spaces used in the next section and remind some
well known results about regularity of elliptic equations. Let us start defining the following

10



weighted spaces: for a fixed ? ? R, let

?? ?
{?

? measurable : ess sup
??R?

(1 + |?|)?|?(?)| &amp;lt;?
}?

and
?? ?

{?
? ? ? 1(R?) : sup

??R?
(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) &amp;lt;?

}?
,

which are Banach spaces with respective norms

????? = ess sup
??R?

(1 + |?|)?|?(?)|

and
????? = sup

??R?
(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) .

Spaces like above with the homogeneous weight |?|? have been used in [44] to treat the
equation ?? + ?|?|??2 + ? (?)? + ? (?) = 0 for ? &gt; ?/(? ? 2) with ? ? 3.

As we will see in the proof of Theorem 1.3.3, the choice of a proper value for ? in the
above spaces depends uniquely on the spaces where the function ? ?? ?(?, 0, 0) is defined and
how |?(?,?)?(·, ?, ??)| behaves with |(?, ??)|.

The problem (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) is formally equivalent to the following integral equation

?(?) =
1

(? ? 2)??

??
R?

1
|? ? ?|??2

?(?, ?(?), ??(?)) ??, (1.2.1)

where ?? is the area of the unit sphere. Therefore, it will be convenient for our purposes to
denote the Newtonian potential of a function ? : R? ? R by

? (? )(?) :=
1

Therefore, in order to solve the mild version (1.2.1) of (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) we just need to look

11



for fixed points of the operator ? in some appropriate subset of ??.
We start by analyzing an integral that will be useful for our needs.

Lemma 1.2.1. Let ?, ? &gt; 0 and 0 &amp;lt;? ? ? &amp;lt;?, then

Proof. Let us define, for every ? ? R?, the functions ??(?) = |? ? ?|?? and ?(?) = (1 + |?|)?? .
Now, using the simplest rearrangement inequality theorem in [57, p. 82], one has

where ?*? and ?* are the symmetric-decreasing rearrangements of ?? and ? respectively. For
?*? we have that

?*?(?) =
?? ?

0
?{|??|&gt;?}* (?) ?? ,

where {|??| &gt; ?}* is the ball centered at the origin with the same measure as {|??| &gt; ?}.
Thus, we can compute

|??(?)| &gt; ? ? |? ? ?|?? &gt; ? ? ? ? ?(?, ??1/?) .

and conclude that {|??| &gt; ?}* = ?(0, ??1/?). Hence

?? ?

??(0,??1/?)(?) ?? =

|?|?

and ?*?(?) = |?|?? for all ? and independently of ?. In the same way we can compute ?*(?)
and obtain that ?*(?) = ?(?) for all ? ? R?. Therefore, from (1.2.2) we have

which is finite, due to the conditions on ? and ?.
The following convolution lemma will be useful for some estimates and its proof can be

12



found in [57, p. 124].

Lemma 1.2.2. Let 0 &amp;lt;?, ? &amp;lt;? with 0 &amp;lt;? + ? &amp;lt;?. Then

and ?? = ???/2?( ?2 ).

Let us recall the following version of the Dominated Convergence Theorem which will be
used in the proof of the next lemma.

Lemma 1.2.3. Let ??, ? , ?? and ? be measurable functions on R? such that ?? ? ? a.e.
and ?? ? ? a.e. as well. If |??| 6 ?? a.e and ?? ? ?1(R?) for all ?, and

??
?? ?

??
? as

? ? ? then,
??

?? ?

The next result gives the necessary regularity we will need for the Newtonian potential
of a function in the space ??.

Lemma 1.2.4. Let 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2 and ? ? ??+2. Then ? (? ) ? ?? and there exists a
constant ?? &gt; 0 satisfying

?? (? )??? 6 ?? ?? ???+2 , for all ? ? ??+2. (1.2.3)

Proof. First we show that ? (? ) ? ? 1(R?). For fixed ?, ? ? R? with |?| = 1 and 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1,
we define the function ??(?) = |? ? ? + ??|2?? on [0, ?]. Note that ?? is differentiable on [0, ?]
if and only if ? ?? ? := {? + ?? | ? ? [0, ?]}. If this is the case, we may write

???(?) = (2 ? ?)
? · (? ? ? + ??)
|? ? ? + ??|?

, for all ? ? (0, ?).

By Mean Value Theorem, for each ? ? R??? there exists ?? ? (0, ?) such that

??(?) ? ??(0)
?

= (2 ? ?)
? · (? ? ? + ???)
|? ? ? + ???|?

. (1.2.4)

Since ? is a measure-zero set, we may write

For each ? ? R???, let ?? be the function

??(?) = ?

??

? · (? ? ? + ???)
|? ? ? + ???|?

? (?) ,

where ?? ? (0, ?) and satisfies (1.2.4). In spite of the fact that ?? may be not unique, the
definition of ??(?) ensures that a different ? satisfying (1.2.4) gives the same value to the
expression of ??(?). Thus ?? is well defined. Furthermore, we have that ?? ? ?0 a.e in R?

as ? ? 0. Note that

where

by Lemma 1.2.1. We also have

??(?) ? ?0(?) a.e. in R? and

where ?1 depends on ? but not on ? since we took ? &amp;lt;1. Therefore, since ????(?) ? ???0(?)

that ??

R?
??(?) ?? =

??

Then, from (1.2.5) and (1.2.8) and the Lemma 1.2.3, we conclude that

? ?1(R?) , if |? ? ?0|&amp;lt;

.

For the existence of ?? satisfying (1.2.3), we first note from the definition of ?.??? that

?? (? )??? = sup
??R?

{?
(1 + |?|)?|? (?)| + (1 + |?|)?|?? (?)|

}?
6 sup

??R?
(1 + |?|)?|? (?)| + sup

(1 + |?|)?|?? (?)|

= ?? (? )??? + ??? (? )??? .

Let us then estimate these two terms. Beginning with the first one, we have that for every
0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2, we can apply the Lemma 1.2.2 with ? = 2 and ? = ? ? ? ? 2 and obtain, for
every ? ? R?,

.

Now, using the Lemma 1.2.1 with ? = ? ? 2 and ? = ? + 2 we obtain

Therefore, for every ? ? R?,

(1 + |?|)?|? (? )(?)| 6 2?
(?

)?
6 2?(?? + ??) ?? ???+2 ,

which implies that
?? (? )??? 6 2

?(?? + ??) ?? ???+2 .

The estimates for the term ??? (? )??? are similar but we will include them here just for
the sake of completeness. In this case for 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2, we can apply Lemma 1.2.2 with
? = 1 and ? = ? ? ? ? 2 and obtain, for every ? ? R?,

Applying Lemma 1.2.1 with ? = ? ? 1 and ? = ? + 2, we conclude

Therefore, taking the sup in the above expression yields

We conclude by putting all these estimates together:

6 2?+2( ???? + ???? + ?? + ??) ?? ???+2
and thus we can take ?? = 2?+2(?? + ?? + ???? + ????) for the constant in the theorem.

To finish this section, we shall include here the following two regularity theorems for
elliptic equations whose proof can be found in [45].

Lemma 1.2.5 (?? Regularity). Let ? ? ? 1,2(?) be a weak solution of ?? = ? in a domain
? ? R? with ? ? ??(?) for some 1 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?. Then ? ? ? 2,???? (?).

Lemma 1.2.6 (? ? Regularity ). Let ? &gt; 0, 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1 and 1 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?. If ? ? R? be
a ? ?+2,1 domain, ? ? ? ?,?(?) and ? ? ? 2,???? (?) is a weak solution to ?? = ? in ?, then
? ? ? ?+2,?(?).

1.3 Existence and symmetries

The fixed point method which will be used in this section needs an appropriate choice of
a subset ? ? ?? where the operator ? can be seen as a contraction, and this contraction
depends uniquely on how large the functions ?(., 0, 0) and ?(?,?)?(., ?, ?) are. Therefore, we
shall solve the problem (1.2.1) under the following hypotheses on ?:

H1) ?(?, ·, ·) belongs to ? 1((R × R?)?(0, 0)) ? ?(R × R?), for all ? ? R?;

H2) There exists 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2 such that the function ? ?? ?(?, 0, 0) belongs to ??+2;

H3) For the same ? in (H2), there exists ? &gt; 0 such that

sup
0&lt;????? ??

???
?(?,?)?(·, ?, ??)

???
?2

&amp;lt;?,

and a further smallness condition on this sup.

Note that, by the choice of spaces we are dealing with, it follows from this approach that
the solution given by this method is already ? 1(R?).

18



Remark 1.3.1. For ? ? ??, (?, ??) ? 0 iff ? ? 0. In spite of the fact that ?(?, ·, ·) is not
differentiable at the point (0, 0), we are assuming with (H3) that ?(?,?)(?, ·, ·) is bounded near
to the origin. Notice that the supremum of ?.??2 in (H3) is computed by excluding ? ? 0.

The assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H3) cover many types of nonlinearities with strong
growth and gradient dependence. In what follows, we give some examples.

Example 1.3.2. Recall first that (1.1.1) is also being defined with ? or ?? replaced respec-
tively by |?| or |??| in the arguments of ?.

• ?(?, ?, |??|) = ?? (?)?? +?? (?)?|??| or ?? (?)??...
??

+?? (?)??...
?|??|

, for every ?, ? ?
??+2 with 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2, and ?, ? ? R;

• ?(?, |?|, |??|) = ? (?)?|?|?1 +|??|?2 , |?|?1 + ? (?)?|??|?2 , ? (?)?|?|?1 + |??|?2 ,
? (?)?|?|?1 |??|?2 + ? or ? (?)|?|?1 ?|??|?2 + ? , for ?1, ?2 &gt; 1 and ?, ? ? ??+2 with
0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2;

• ?(?, |?|, |??|) = ?|?|?1 +|??|?2 ? 1 + ? (?) or ?(?, ?, ??) = ??(|?|
?1 +|??|?2 ) ? 1 + ? (?), for

?1, ?2 &gt; 1 and ? ? ??+2 with 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2;

• ?(?, |?|, |??|) = |?|?1 + |??|?2 + ? (?) or |?|?1 |??|?2 + ? (?), for ?1, ?2 &gt; 1 and
? ? ??+2 with 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2.

We will show existence of solutions for (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) in R? with ? ? 3 and conditions
on ? (see (H1)-(H3)) covering polynomial and exponential type growths on ? and ??, see
Examples 1.3.2, 1.3.6 and 1.3.7. In particular, since ?(?, 0, 0) does not need to be continu-
ous, the nonlinearity (0.0.3) can be treated with singular potentials ? (non-continuous and
bounded) and |?| close to zero, including also negative values (see Example 1.3.6 below).

From now on we assume that ? &gt; 3 and that ? : R? × R × R? ? R satisfies (H1)-(H3).
We begin with existence and local uniqueness of solutions for the integral equation (1.2.1).

Theorem 1.3.3. There exists a constant ?? &gt; 0 such that if ? : R? × R × R? ? R satisfies
(H1)-(H3) for some 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2 and the following inequalities

sup
0&lt;????? ??

???
?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)

???
?2

&amp;lt;??

19



and
??(., 0, 0)???+2 6 ???,

are satisfied for some ? &gt; 0, then the integral equation (1.2.1) has a unique solution ? ? ??
with ????? 6 ?, which is in particular a weak solution for (1.1.1)-(1.1.2). Furthermore, if
? ? ? ?,???? (R? × R × R?) for an integer ? ? 0 with 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1, then ? ? ?

?+2,?
??? (R?) and ?

verifies (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) classically.

Remark 1.3.4. In the statement of Theorem 1.3.3, the constant ?? can be taken as 12??
where ?? is as in Lemma 1.2.4 in the previous section, as we can see from the proof below.
In fact, in view of the proof of Lemma 1.2.4, it is possible to estimate ?? and ?? explicitly.

Proof. Let ? ? R?, (?, ?1, ?1), (?, ?2, ?2) ? R? × R × R? and [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)] be the closed
line segment between (?1, ?1) and (?2, ?2) in R?+1. If (0, 0) /? [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)] then, from the
hypothesis (H1), we have

|?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)| 6 sup
(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1 ? ?2, ?1 ? ?2)| .

Now, if (0, 0) ? [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)], then we have that |(?1, ?1)| + |(?2, ?2)| = |(?1, ?1) ? (?2, ?2)|
and, by (H1)

|?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)| 6 |?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, 0, 0)| + |?(?, 0, 0) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)|
6 sup

(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(0,0))
|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1, ?1)|

+ sup
(?,?)?((0,0),(?2,?2)]

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?2, ?2)|

6 sup
(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]?(0,0)

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)|(|(?1, ?1)| + |(?2, ?2)|)

= sup
(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]?(0,0)

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1 ? ?2, ?1 ? ?2)| .

Thus, for a fixed ? &gt; 0 and ?, ? ? ?? with 0 &amp;lt;????? , ????? &amp;lt;?, we write (?, ??) =
(?(?), ??(?)) to obtain

|?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, ?, ??)| 6 sup
(?,?)?[(?,??),(?,??)]?(0,0)

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)|

6 sup
0&lt;????? 6?

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)| ,

20



because for every (?, ?) with |?|, |??| &amp;lt;?, ? = 1, . . . , ?, we can find a function ? ? ?? such
that ????? &amp;lt;? and (?, ?) = (?, ??) at a point ?. Hence, we have that

(1 + |?|)?+2|?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, ?, ??)| 6
sup

0&lt;????? 6?
(1 + |?|)2|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)|(1 + |?|)?|(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)| ,

and by (H3), it follows that

??(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)???+2 6 sup
0&lt;????? 6?

???
?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)

???
?2

?? ? ???? .

Now, take ?? = 12?? where ?? is the constant given by the Lemma 1.2.4 and, by hypothesis,
let ? &gt; 0 be such that

?? := sup
0&lt;????? 6?

???
?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)

???
?2

&lt;
1

2??
.

We will show that ? is a contraction in the ball ?? = {? ? ?? : ????? 6 ?}. Fix ?, ? ? ??
and note that

?(?) ? ?(?) = ? (?(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)) ,

so we can use Lemma 1.2.4 and estimate

??(?) ? ?(?)??? = ?? (?(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??))???
6 ?? ??(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)???+2
6 ???? ?? ? ????
6

1

?? ? ???? .

Thus for ? ? ?? and ? = 0 in the above inequality, we have

??(?)??? 6 ??(?) ? ?(0)??? + ??(0)???

????? + ?? (?(., 0, 0))???

????? + ?? ??(., 0, 0)???+2

6
?

+ ??

?

2??

which shows that ?(??) ? ??. Therefore ? is a contraction in ?? and the result follows by
applying the Banach fixed point theorem.

The regularity of ? will follow from the fact that ? is also a solution in the weak sense to
(1.1.1) and the classical regularity results. Indeed, since ? ? ? 1(R?), ?(., ?, ??) ? ??(R?)
and the kernel |?|2?? is locally integrable, we have for all ? ? ? ?? (R?) that,??

R?
?? · ?? ?? = ?

?(?, ?(?), ??(?))?(?) ??.

Therefore, ? is a weak solution. Moreover, ? is a weak solution of (1.1.1) on every ball
? in R? and ? ? ? 1,2(?). Therefore, since we have ?(., ?, ??) ? ??(?) for all ? &gt; 1 and
for every ball ?, we can use Lemma 1.2.5 and conclude that ? ? ? 2,?(?) for every ? &gt; 1.
Therefore, for ? &gt; ? we have the embedding ? 2,?(?) ?? ? 1,?(?), for ? = 1 ? ?

?
and we

conclude that ? ? ? 1,? (?) for every 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1.

Now, if ? ? ? ????(R? × R × R?) then ?(., ?, ??) ? ? 0,?? (?) for all 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1 and, by
Lemma 1.2.6, we have that ? ? ? 2,?? (?). Hence ?(., ?, ??) ? ? ?(?) and we can perform
the previous argument once more and conclude that ? ? ? 2,?(?).

Therefore, if ? ? ? 1,???? (R? × R × R?) we now have that ?(., ?, ??) ? ? 1,?? (?) and we can
conclude that ? ? ? 3,?(?).

Repeating the argument above we can infer that whenever ? ? ? ?,???? (R? × R × R?) with
? &gt; 1 then ?(., ?, ??) ? ? ?,?(?) and, by Lemma 1.2.6, we have that ? ? ? ?+2,?(?) for
every ball ?. In view of the fact that ? is a solution of (1.1.1) in the sense of distributions
and ? ? ?? ? ? ?+2,???? (R?), then ? is a classical solution of (1.1.1)-(1.1.2).

Remark 1.3.5. The fixed point theorem applied above gives an iterative method to construct

22



the solution ?, which is the limit in the norm ?.??? of the following sequence

?1 = ?(0) = ? (?(., 0, 0)) and ?? = ?(???1) , ? ? N.

Moreover, all elements of this sequence verify ?????? ? ?.

In the sequel we present two examples.

Example 1.3.6. Let ?? = 12?? where ?? is as in Lemma 1.2.4 (see Remark 1.3.4). Let ?
and ? be real parameters and let

?(?, ?, ??) = ?? (?)?? + ?? (?)?|??|,

where ?, ? ? ??+2 for some 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2. The case ? = 0 is the so-called Liouville
equation which arises, as pointed out above, in many physical situations and has produced
a rich mathematical theory when ? = 2 (see e.g. [10], [41], [65], [72]). Here we solve the
problem for all dimension ? ? 3. We have that

(1 + |?|)2|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)| =

for all 0 ?= ? ? ??, and

(1 + |?|)?+2|?(?, 0, 0)| = |?|(1 + |?|)?+2|? (?)| + |?|(1 + |?|)?+2|? (?)|
6 |?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2 .

Then, Theorem 1.3.3 allows us to solve the problem of the present example if we can find
? &gt; 0 such that (?

and

|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2 6

We see from these inequalities that if we take

? = 2??
(?
|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2

)?
,

the problem will have a solution if ? and ? are such that

2??
(?
|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2

The continuous dependence of the solution with respect to ? and ? follows by using that the
solution ? satisfies

????? 6 ?.

This means that the equation ?? + ?? (?)?? + ?? (?)?|??| = 0 has a bounded solution in R?

if the parameters |?| and |?| are small enough, regardless the sign of ?, ?, ?, ? , and allowing
to consider non-continuous coefficients ? and ? .

Example 1.3.7. According to Remark 1.3.4, let us take ?? = 12?? where ?? is as in Lemma
1.2.4. Take ? of the form ?(?, ?, ?1, . . . , ??) = ?(?, ??0 , ??11 . . . , ???? ), where ?? &gt; 1 for all ?. If
? = min{?0, . . . , ??} and ? = 2??1 , suppose that ?(?, 0, 0) ? ??+2 and there exists ? &gt; 0 such
that ?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??) ? ?? for all ? ? ??. Then, differentiating we obtain

A natural question is whether ? presents qualitative properties according to ?. The
following results show that the solution obtained by the previous theorem inherits indeed
many properties from the nonlinearity ?.

Theorem 1.3.8. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3.3, the solution ? satisfies:

(i) If ? &gt; 0, then ? &gt; 0;

(ii) If ?(?, ?, ?) &gt; 0 for all (?, ?, ?) ? R? ×R×R?, with ?(?, ?, ?) ?? 0 when |(?, ?)|R×R? ? ?,
then ? &gt; 0;

(iii) ? is radially symmetric provided that ?(·, ?, ?) is radially symmetric for each fixed
(?, ?) ? R × R? such that |(?, ?)|R×R? ? ?.

Proof. The item (i) follows from the fact that the Newtonian potential of a nonnegative func-
tion is nonnegative. To prove item (ii), notice that ????? ? ? implies that |(?(?), ??(?))|R×R? ?
?, for all ? ? R?. It follows that ?(?, ?(?), ??(?)) ?? 0, and then ? = ? (?(?, ?, ??)) is posi-
tive. To establish item (iii), recall first that the solution ? is the limit under the norm ?.???
of the sequence ?? (see Remark 1.3.5). Notice that ?1 is radially symmetric if and only if
?(?, 0, 0) is radially symmetric. Since ??1??? ? ?, we have that |(?1(?), ??1(?))|R×R? ? ?,
for all ? ? R?, and then ?2 = ? (?(?, ?1, ??1)) is radially symmetric provided that ?1 is
radially symmetric. By induction, ?? is radially symmetric. Since the convergence in ??
preserves radial symmetry, we conclude that ? is radially symmetric.

More results about symmetry as in item (iii) of Theorem 1.3.8 can be proved by consid-
ering orthogonal transformations in the space. Let ? be a subset of the orthogonal matrix
group ?(?) of R?. We say that a function ? is symmetric under the action of ? when

25



?(?) = ?(? ?), for all ? ? ?. Similarly we say that ? is antisymmetric under the action of ?
when ?(?) = ??(? ?), for all ? ? ?.

Theorem 1.3.9. Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3.3 and let ? be the solution given by
it. Let ? be a subset of ?(?) and suppose that by the action of ?, the function ? = ?(?, ?, ?)
satisfies

(i) ? is symmetric in ? and ?. Then ? is symmetric under ?;

(ii) ? is antisymmetric in ?. Then ? ? 0;

(iii) ? is antisymmetric in ?, even in ? (?.?. ?(·, ?, ·) = ?(·, ??, ·)) and symmetric in ?. Then
? is antisymmetric.

Proof. (?) Given ? ? ?, we have that ?(? ?, 0, 0) = ?(?, 0, 0), then

?1(? ?) =

?(?, 0, 0) ?? = ?1(?)

by the change of variables ? = ? ?. Thus, ?1 is symmetric under ?.
To prove that ?2 is symmetric, notice that ??1(?) = ?(?1(? ?)) = ? ? · ??1(? ?). We

compute

by the symmetry of ?. Then ?2 is symmetric as well. Using an induction argument, we see
that ?? is symmetric under ?, for all ? ? N. Since ? is the limit of ?? in the norm of ??,
it preserves the symmetry.

(??) Since ? antisymmetric in ?, then ?(?, 0, 0) = ?(?, 0, ? 0) = ??(?, 0, 0) implies ?(., 0, 0) ?
0. Therefore, the fixed point of ? is ? ? 0.

(???) One has ?(? ?, 0, 0) = ??(?, 0, 0), and the computations above give us ?1(? ?) =
??1(?). Thus, it follows for ?2

?2(? ?) =

?(?, ?1(?), ??1(?)) ?? = ??2(?).

By induction one has ??(? ?) = ???(?). Therefore, one concludes that ? is antisymmetric.

It follows from the definition of the space ?? that the solution given by Theorem 1.3.3
satisfies ? = ?((1 + |?|)??) and ?? = ?((1 + |?|)??) as |?| ? ?, if ?(?, 0, 0) = ?((1 +
|?|)???2). In the next theorem, we improve this behavior by assuming a natural condition,
namely if ?(?, 0, 0) = ?((1 + |?|)???2) then the solution ? and its gradient are ?((1 + |?|)??)
as well.

The following lemma was proved in [44] and it will be necessary for the next theorem.

Lemma 1.3.10. Let 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? ? 2. If ? ? ??+2, then

lim sup
|?|??

|?|?|? (? )(?)| 6 ?? lim sup

where ?? = ?(????2,1,?)(??2)?? .

Theorem 1.3.11. Let ? be as in Theorem 1.3.3. If lim
|?|??

(1 + |?|)?+2|?(?, 0, 0)| = 0, then

lim
|?|??

(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) = 0. (1.3.1)

27



Proof. First recall that the solution given by Theorem 1.3.3 satisfies ????? ? ?. Note also
that, by the proof of Theorem 1.3.3, if ? ? ??, then ?(?, ?, ??) ? ??+2 and therefore
?? = ?? (?(?, ?, ??)) ? ??+1. Thus, one concludes that

(1 + |?|)?+1|??(?)|

6 lim sup

Splitting the expression (1.3.1) into two ones, one only needs to check lim
|?|??

(1+|?|)?|?(?)| = 0.
For that matter, one estimates

|?(?, ?, ??)| 6 |?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, 0, 0)| + |?(?, 0, 0)|
6 sup

0&lt;????? ??
|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(?, ??)| + |?(?, 0, 0)|.

Using the hypotheses, one has

|?|?+2|?(?, ?, ??)| 6 lim sup
|?|??

|?|?+2 sup
0&lt;????? ??

|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(?, ??)|.

By Lemma 1.3.10, one concludes

lim sup

|?|?|?(?)| = lim sup

|?|?|?(?)|

and, since ???? 6 ???? &amp;lt;12 , the result follows.

Remark 1.3.12. It is worthy of note that many results in this chapter remain true in prob-
lems where the associated Green’s function ?(?, ?) satisfies the following estimate:

for some constant ? = ?(?, ?) with 1/2 &amp;lt;? 6 1. This includes cases like bounded domains

Chapter 2

Asymptotic Behavior for the 1D
Porous Medium Equation with
Fractional Pressure

We analyze the rate of convergence towards the stationary state of solutions to the one
dimensional fractional version of the porous medium equation, where the pressure is obtained
as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian of the density. Using self-similar variables and
the convexity of the interaction potential in dimension one, it is possible to show that the
associated entropy is displacement convexity and therefore, satisfies a functional inequality
originated from optimal transport theory which involves also the entropy dissipation and the
Euclidean transport distance. An argument by approximation on the equation assures that
this functional inequality is enough to deduce the exponential convergence of solutions to the
unique steady state.

2.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we analyse the long-time asymptotics of the nonlinear nonlocal equation

??? = ? ·
(?
?(?(??)??? + ??)

)?
, ? &gt; 0, ? ? R? , (2.1.1)

30



obtained from the fractional version of the porous medium equation introduced by Caffarelli
and Vázquez [20, 21]

?? ? = ? · (??(??)???) , (2.1.2)

by passing to self-similar variables. Indeed, by adding the Fokker-Planck confining term
? · (??), solutions to (2.1.1) will characterize the long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions
to (2.1.2). This connection will be further explained below.

The equation (2.1.2) is one of the two fractional variations of the classical porous medium
equation

?? ? = ??? (2.1.3)

= ? · (???) , ? =
?

? ? 1
???1 (2.1.4)

for ? &gt; 1. The first version can be recovered from (2.1.3) by replacing the ordinary Laplacian
by its fractional version

?? ? = ?(??)???

and appears, for example, in stochastic equations when jump processes are introduced into
the modelling of heat conduction, known as anomalous diffusion, (see [1, 79, 81]). The
mathematical theory behind it can be checked in the surveys [76, 77] and references therein.

The other version, which is the one of our interest here, follows from (2.1.4) and can be
viewed as a continuity equation, ?? ? + ? · (?v) = 0, for a density or concentration ?(?, ?)
with velocity v = ???, where the velocity potential or pressure ? is related to ? by the
inverse of a fractional Laplacian operator ? = ?

??1 (??)
?????1, 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1. The standard

porous medium equation is recovered for ? = 0 and the equation (2.1.2) when ? = 2. This
model appears when one has nonlocal effects as long-range diffusive interactions and it has
been studied by an extensive list of authors.

We assume that the unknown ?(?, ?), representing a density or concentration, is defined
for ? ? R? and ? &gt; 0 and supply initial data ?(?, 0) = ?0(?), a nonnegative mass distribution
in ?1(R?) ? ??(R?). We also point out that the pressure can be represented as

? = (??)??? = ??,? * ?,

31



with the singular convolution kernel

??,?(?) = ??,?|?|2???, ??,? =
?2?2??(?/2 ? ?)

??/2?(1 + ?)
, (2.1.5)

and 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;min(1, ?/2), called the Riesz potential of ? as in the standard textbooks [52,
70]. This representation also makes sense for ? = ?/2 with the logarithm kernel

??, ?2
(?) = ?21?????/2?(?/2)?1 log |?|

(see [23, 54] in one dimension) and for 1/2 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1 in one dimension with the negative
coefficient ?1,? and the positive exponent 2? ? 1 in ??,?(?). As a result, the kernel ??,?(?)
does not necessarily decay to zero at infinity in the last two cases, but the magnitude of the
gradient ???,?(?) does. When the kernel ??,?(?) is replaced by a less singular radially sym-
metric function, the same equation appeared in granular flow [12, 74, 56, 25] and biological
swarming [61, 14, 13].

To describe the long time behaviour of solutions to (2.1.2), it is more convenient to study
the corresponding transformed equation (2.1.1) as discussed in [26, 21], by defining

?(?, ?) := (1 + ? )??(?, ?), (2.1.6)

with the similarity variables ? = ?(1 + ? )?? and ? = log(1 + ? ). The exponents ? and ? can
be determined from dimensional analysis and the mass conservation [11], which are given by

? =
?

? + 2 ? 2?
, ? =

1
? + 2 ? 2?

. (2.1.7)

In this way, the rescaled density ?(?, ?) satisfies (2.1.1) with ? = ? = 1/(? + 2 ? 2?). We will
keep ? &gt; 0 arbitrary in (2.1.1) as a parameter to characterize the convexity of the energy
defined below and the convergence rate to the steady state later on. As a result, the long time
behaviour of the original density ?(?, ?) is completely specified if we establish the behavior
of ?(?, ?) with ? = ?. Furthermore, due to the change of variables ? = log(1 + ? ), any
convergence of ?(?, . ) as ? ? ? is going to be slower than the one for ?(?, . ).

Let us point out that the fractional porous medium equation (2.1.1) can be viewed as a

32



particular case of a much more general aggregation-diffusion equation [25, 14, 9] written as

??? = ? ·
(?
??

(?
? * ? + ? + ? ?(?)

)?)?
, ? ? R? , (2.1.8)

where ?, ? : R? ? R ? {?} and ? : [0, ?) ? R and we recover (2.1.1) for ? (?) = ?2 |?|
2

and ? (?) = ??,?|?|2???, 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1 and ? = 0.

During the past fifteen years, several important techniques [63, 26, 37, 25, 78, 6] have been
developed for the convergence of linear or nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations to their steady
states with sharp rate. These techniques can also be employed to prove the convergence of
solutions of (2.1.1) as ? ? ? by realizing that the free energy ? (?) defined as

? (?) =

?(?) ??,

is a Lyapunov functional for 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;min(1, ?/2). One can similarly define the Lyapunov
functional for 1/2 ? ? &amp;lt;1 in one dimension, assuming that ? satisfies a growth condition at
infinity, namely ? log |?| ? ?1(R) if ? = 1/2 and ?|?|2??1 ? ?1(R) if 1/2 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1. In fact,
(2.1.1) is a gradient flow of the free energy functional (2.1.9) with respect to the Euclidean
transport distance in the metric space of probability measures [6, 24].

The basic properties of the energy ? (?) and its dissipation ?(?) defined below, together
with the long-time asymptotics of solutions to (2.1.1), are already derived in [21]. More
precisely, along the evolution governed by (2.1.1), one can obtain the formal relation

?

??
?
(?
?(?, .)

)?
= ??

(?
?(?, .)

)?
, (2.1.10)

where we denote by ?(?) the entropy production or entropy dissipation of ? given by

?(?) =
??
R?

? |??|2 ?? , with ? =
??
??

= (??)??? +
?

2
|?|2.

Using this relation, the solution of (2.1.1) is shown to converge towards a function ?? (which
coincides with the respective stationary state) in [21], but no rate of convergence is obtained.
To be more precise, they show that solutions of the fractional porous medium equation (2.1.1)

33



satisfy the energy inequality

(?

)?

?
(?

that is enough to conclude the converge of ?(?, ?) to the steady state ??(?).

Let us now say a few words about the function ?? of (2.1.1) and its characterizations.
The existence and uniqueness of the steady state were initially characterized in [21] by the
following obstacle problem for the pressure ? = (??)????

? (?) &gt; ?(?) for ? ? R? ,
(??)?? (?) &gt; 0 for ? ? R? ,
(??)?? (?) = 0 for ? (?) &gt; ?(?) ,

where the obstacle is the quadratic function ?(?) = ?* ? ?2 |?|
2. The self-similar solution

of (2.1.2) were also obtained and given by

?(?, ?) = (1 + ? )??/(?+2?2?)??
(?
?(1 + ? )?1/(?+2?2?)

)?
.

The explicit expression for ?? was then obtained by Biler, Imbert and Karch in [15, 16] for
even more general nonlinear dependence of the pressure ? = (??)?????1, ? &gt; 1. In case
? = 2 of our interest here, they obtained that

??(?) = ??,?
(?
?2 ? |?|2

)?1??
+

(2.1.11)

where
??,? =

22??1?(?/2 + 1)
?(2 ? ?)?(?/2 + 1 ? ?)

? .

The radius ? of the support is determined by the conservation of mass, that is,

1 =
??
R?

?(?, ?)?? =
22???/2?(?/2 + 1)?

(? + 2 ? 2?)?(?/2 + 1 ? ?)2
??+2?2?. (2.1.12)

The expression (2.1.11) allow us to check directly that ?? is in fact the minimum for the
energy ? by a recent result of Chafaï, Gozlan and Zitt in [32, Theorem 1.2] where it was proved
that ? restricted to ?(R?) is strictly convex in the classic sense for 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;min(1, ?/2), and

34



it has a unique compactly supported minimizer ?? characterized by

(??)????(?) + ?

= ?* , for all ? ? supp (??) (2.1.13a)

(??)????(?) + ?
|?2|
2

&gt; ?* , a.e. R? , (2.1.13b)

for some constant ?* determined by the total mass. This formulation is equivalent to the
obstacle problem in [21]. Using the following relation (see [15, 16])

(??)??(?2 ? |?|2)1??+ =
2?2??(2 ? ?)?(?/2 ? ?)

?(?/2)

(?

=
?

2??,?

(?
?

? ? 2?
?2 ? |?|2

)?
, for all |?| 6 ?, (2.1.14)

it is easy to verify that ?? = ??,?(?2 ? |?|2)1??+ is indeed the minimizer for ? for 0 &amp;lt;?&amp;lt;
min(1, ?/2). Similar computations can be done in the range 1/2 ? ? &amp;lt;1, see [23, 9] for
instance.

In this chapter, we will focus on obtaining the sharp convergence rate for the solutions
of the Cauchy problem for (2.1.1) towards the equilibrium ??, for all 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2 in one
dimension, although many of the calculations presented also hold in general dimensions.
In the particular case of ? = 1/2 in one dimension, the kernel is given by the logarithmic
potential and it was treated in [23], see also [54] for related functional inequalities. In fact, it
is shown in [23] that the energy ? (?) is displacement convex, which can not be derived directly
from the criteria given in the seminal paper by McCann [59]. We will take advantage of these
techniques in [23] to prove certain functional inequalities, in particular the HWI inequalities as
introduced in [64] (also obtained in [54] for the logarithmic case ? = 1/2). This displacement
convexity and related inequalities are then used to show the convergence towards equilibrium
in one dimension, through the exponential decay of the transport distances and the relative
energy, for general ? ? (0, 1). Roughly speaking, the strategy will be as follow: since we
already have the relation (2.1.10) for the solutions of (2.1.1), we will prove that the following
generalized log-Sobolev inequality

? (?) ? ? (??) 6
1

2?
?(?)

holds for a class of probability measures ?. This inequality appears in [21] as an open problem

35



with some of its equivalences. Hence, the result will follow from the Gronwall’s inequality
since, for any solution ?(?, ?) satisfying an initial condition ?(0, .) = ?0, we have

?

??
(? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??)) = ??(?(?, .)) 6 ?2? (? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??)) ,

and therefore
? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??) 6 ??2?? (? (?0) ? ? (??)) .

This inequality is the main result of this chapter and will be proved in Theorem 2.4.1.
The organization of this chapter is as follows. We first remind the reader in Section 2.2

about the basics of optimal transport theory and we prove two lemmas about the energies ?
and ?? that will be used in the later sections. Section 2.3 will be devoted to the functional
inequalities that we will prove in one dimension. In fact, in order to obtain our main result
we will follow closely the strategy developed for nonlinear diffusion equations in [8, 7, 26, 37,
29, 25] to reduce the prove of the convergence to the proof of a Log-Sobolev type inequality.
This inequality is then proved as a consequence of the HWI inequality which crucially uses
the displacement convexity of the functionals involved. Finally, on section 2.4 we obtain
the rate of convergence towards equilibrium of the solutions to (2.1.1) by an approximation
method using the construction of solutions in [20]. This convergence is proved for the energy
of solutions and for the spaces ?1 and ?2.

Finally, we point out that the problem of sharp convergence rates in several space dimen-
sions is still open. Moreover, it could be interesting to prove or disprove analogous functional
inequalities involving nonlocal operators in several space dimensions corresponding to the
ones established here in one dimension; see more comments at the end of Section 2. New
techniques or inequalities have to be developed. Showing asymptotic convergence when the
confining term ? · (???) is replace by the general drift ? · (??? ) is another interesting
problem, see [32, 25].

2.2 Optimal transport results

We use optimal transport techniques to prove the Log-Sobolev, the Talagrand, and the
HWI inequalities for both the energies ? and ?? for smooth probability measures ? ? ?2,??(R).
Therefore, in order to make this chapter more self-contained, this section will be devoted to
review some results in optimal transport theory that shall be required later. The section

36



finishes with some simple but new properties about the above mentioned energies.
Firstly, let us define the metric that is going to be used on the probability space. The

Wasserstein distance ?2 on ?2(R) is defined for any ?1, ?2 ? ?2(R) by

?2(?1, ?2) :=
(?

inf
???(?1,?2)

??
R×R

|? ? ?|2 ??(?, ?)
)?1

2

,

where ?(?1, ?2) be the set of all nonnegative Radon measures ? on R × R such that

?(? × R) = ?1(?) and ?(R × ?) = ?2(?), for all ?, ? ? R. (2.2.1)

If a measure ? satisfies (2.2.1) we say that it has marginals (projections) ?1 and ?2. The
infimum in the definition of ?2 is actually a minimum, and in the case we are dealing with
in this chapter, it is unique and can be characterized by the following:

Theorem 2.2.1 (see, for example, [78] for a proof). Given ?1, ?2 ? ?2(R) with ?1 absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, there exists a Borel map ? ?2?1 : R ? R such
that ? ?2?1 #?1 = ?2, i.e.,??

R
?(?) ??2(?) =

??
R

?(? ?2?1 (?)) ??1(?), for every ?2-integrable function ?,

and ? ?2?1 also satisfies

?2(?1, ?2) =
(???

R
|? ? ? ?2?1 (?)|

2 ??1(?)
)?1

2
,

It is well known that the optimal map ? ?2?1 is nondecreasing on R and increasing on supp (?1).
Furthermore, if ?1 and ?2 are, respectively, the cumulative distribution functions of ?1 and
?2, defined by

??(?) :=
?? ?

??
??? = ??

(?
(??, ?]

)?
,

then we can write ? ?2?1 in terms of them, that is ?
?2
?1

(?) = ? ?12 ? ?1(?).

One can use the previous theorem to define a very convenient set of curves in ?2,??(R) in
the following way: given ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) and ? ?1?0 the optimal map such that ?

?1
?0

#?0 = ?1,
let us write

?? :=
(?
(1 ? ?)Id + ?? ?1?0

)?
#?0 , for all ? ? [0, 1].

37



The curve (??)06?61 is called displacement interpolation between ?0 and ?1. It is not hard
to see that ?? also belongs to ?2,??(R) for all ? ? [0, 1], and with this one can define the
following:

Definition 2.2.2. For a functional ? : ?2,??(R) ? (??, +?], we are going to say that

• ? is displacement convex if, given any ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) with (??)06?61 their displacement
interpolation, the function ? ?? ? (??) is convex on [0, 1].

• ? is strictly displacement convex if ? ?? ? (??) is strictly convex on [0, 1].

• ? is ?-displacement convex, for some ? ? R, if for all ? ? [0, 1]

(1 ? ?)? (?0) + ?? (?1) ? ? (??) &gt; ?
?(1 ? ?)

2
?2(?0, ?1)2,

or equivalentely
?2

??2
? (??) &gt; ??2(?0, ?1)2.

Some of the functionals we are going to use in the rest of the chapter are combinations
of the following ones:

? (?) =
??
R

?(?) log ?(?) ?? , (2.2.2)

?(?) =
1
2

??
R

?2 ??(?) and (2.2.3)

??(?) =
1
2

??
R

??
R

?1,?
|? ? ?|1?2?

??(?) ??(?) , (2.2.4)

where we are committing an abuse of notation by identifying every absolutely continuous
measure with its density. So we shall write ??(?) and ?(?)?? meaning the same thing
throughout the rest of the chapter. Therefore, we can write the energy functional ? as

? (?) = ??(?) + ??(?)

and besides this one, we are also going to need the following approximate functional: for
every ? &gt; 0 and every measure ? ? ?2,??(R) we define:

??(?) := ? (?) + ? ? (?) ,

38



and associated with it we have a respective energy dissipation

??(?) :=
??
R

???
??(????)???(?) + ?? + ??? log ?(?)

???2
??(?) .

These two functionals are associated to the regularized equation (2.4.2) in the next section.
The metric ?2 on ?2(R) is related with a very known notion of convergence. We say that

the a sequence (??)??N ? ?2(R) is narrowly convergent to ? ? ?(R) (denoted by ?? ? ?) if

lim
???

??
?(?) ???(?) =

??
?(?) ??(?) , (2.2.5)

for all ? ? ??(R), the space of bounded and continuous functions.
With this definition in hand, we can characterize the notion of convergence in ?2(R):

Theorem 2.2.3. The pair (?2(R), ?2) is a complete metric space and the convergence under
the distance ?2 is stronger than the convergence in the narrow sense. In fact, the following
three facts are equivalent for any (??)??N ? ?2(R) and ? ? ?(R):

? ?2(??, ?) ? 0 as ? ? +?;

? ?? ? ? and
lim

???

??
?2 ???(?) =

??
?2 ??(?);

? ?? ? ? and
lim

???
lim sup

???

??
|?|&gt;?

?2 ???(?) = 0. (2.2.6)

The convergence in the narrow sense can be characterized using the notion of tightness
of a set of measures. We say that a set ? ? ?(R) is tight if the following condition holds:

for all ? &gt; 0 there exists a compact ?? ? R such that sup
???

?(R???) 6 ?. (2.2.7)

The condition (2.2.7) is equivalent to the following integral and easier-to-verify condition:
there exists ? : R ? [0, ?] such that

for all ? &gt; 0, {? ? R | ?(?) 6 ?} is compact and sup
???

??
R

?(?) ??(?) &amp;lt;? (2.2.8)

39



Now we can state the following Euclidean version of the Prokhorov’s compactness theo-
rem:

Theorem 2.2.4 (Prokhorov). A set ? ? ?(R) is tight if and only if it is relatively compact
(under the narrow convergence).

For a detailed proof of the above theorems and generalizations, the reader may check the
standard references [6], [78] (for the results involving the Wasserstein distance) and [38] (for
a proof of the Prokhorov’s Theorem).

Let us now prove a lemma that shall be used in the last section for the convergence in
entropy of the solutions of the approximate problems. The proof uses similar arguments
given in the Theorem 1.4 of [69].

Lemma 2.2.5. The entropy ?? is narrow lower semicontinuous and ?-displacement convex,
for all ?, ? &gt; 0. In the case ? = 0, ?? is strictly displacement convex.

Proof. We already know from [59] that the functional ? is narrow lower semicontinuous and
also strictly displacement convex, so we just need to show the result for ? . For this, firstly
let us show the semicontinuity by writing the energy in the following way:

? (?) =
??
R2

? (?, ?) ??(?)??(?),

where

? (?, ?) =

???
??

?

4
(?2 + ?2) +

?1,?
2

1
|? ? ?|1?2?

, if ? ?= ?

+? , if ? = ?
.

Since ? is non-negative and smooth outside the diagonal ? = ?, we can find a sequence
{??}??N ? ??(R2) such that ??(?, ?) ? ? (?, ?) for all (?, ?) ? R2. Therefore, if {??}??N ?
?2,??(R) is such ?? ? ? for some ? ? ?(R), by the monotone convergence theorem and the
fact that ?? × ?? ? ? × ?, we have that

? (?) =
??

? (?, ?) ??(?)??(?) = lim
???

??
??(?, ?) ??(?)??(?)

= lim
???

lim
???

??
??(?, ?) ???(?)???(?) 6 lim inf

???

??
? (?, ?) ???(?)???(?)

= lim inf
???

? (??) .

40



Now, for the convexity property, we also know from [59] or [78] that the functional ??(?)
is ?-displacement convex. Therefore we just need to show that ? is displacement convex.
For this, let ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) and, to simplify the notation, ? := ? ?1?0 the optimal map given by
(2.2.1) such that ?#?0 = ?1 and let (??)06?61 be their displacement interpolant. To simplify
the notation, let us call

??(?) =
?1,?

|?|1?2?

the kernel of the Riesz potential. Then we have the following for each ? ? [0, 1]

?(??) =
1
2

?? ??
??(? ? ?) ???(?)???(?)

=
1
2

?? ??
??((1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?))) ??0(?)??0(?). (2.2.9)

Also by (2.2.1) we know that ? is nondecreasing on R and increasing outside a set ? such
that ?0(? ) = 0. Therefore, for all ?, ? ? ? ? with ? ?= ? we have that ? ? ? and ?(?) ? ?(?)
are both either on the negative or on the positive semi-line, where we can use the convexity
of ?? and write

??((1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?))) 6 (1 ? ?)??(? ? ?) + ???(?(?) ? ?(?)). (2.2.10)

The only care we need to take is to avoid the singularity of the function ?? by proving that

(1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?)) ?= 0,

for all ? ? [0, 1] and forall ?, ? ? ? ? with ? ?= ?. For this, let us suppose that there exist
?* ? (0, 1] and ?*, ?* ? ? ? with ?* ?= ?* such that

(1 ? ?*)(?* ? ?*) + ?*(?(?*) ? ?(?*)) = 0, (2.2.11)

then we obtain that
?(?*) ? ?(?*)

?* ? ?*
= ?

1 ? ?*
?*

6 0,

which contradicts the strict monotonicity of ?. If ?* = 0 then the only way to have (2.2.11)

41



is if ?* = ?*. Finally, from (2.2.9) and (2.2.10) we can deduce

?(??) 6
(1 ? ?)

2

?? ??
??(? ? ?) ??0(?)??0(?) +

?

2

?? ??
??(?(?) ? ?(?)) ??0(?)??0(?)

= (1 ? ?)?(?0) + ??(?1)

which gives the displacement convexity of the functional ?.

The next lemma shows that the functional ?? also admits a unique minimum. This result
is going to allow us to obtain the same desired asymptotic behavior for the solutions of the
approximate problem.

Lemma 2.2.6. Let ?, ? &gt; 0 and ?? := inf{??(?) | ? ? ?2(R)}. Then:

1) ?? is finite;

2) There exists a unique ??? ? ?2,??(R) such that ??(???) = ??.

Proof. Note that for every ? ? ?2,??(R) we have the following estimate:

?? (?) +
?

?(?) = ?

??
?(?) log ?(?) ?? +

2

?
??, (2.2.12)

where ? :=
??

??
?
4? ?

2
?? =

??
4??
?

. Therefore, since ? ?? ? log ? in convex, we can use the
Jensen’s Inequality on the last expression and obtain

??
??

(???

?

?

4??
. (2.2.13)

42



In particular, this also implies that for all ? ? ?2,??(R):

??(?) &gt; ?? (?) +
?

2
?(?) &gt; ? log

?

2??
&gt; ? log

?

4??

which proves the item (i).

Now, let {??}??N ? ?2,??(R) such that ??(??) 6 ? + 1? . By the inequalities (2.2.12)
and (2.2.13) above, we have the following estimate for the second moments

?

4??
.

Therefore we have that the sequence {??}??N satisfies

sup
??N

??
?2??(?) ?? &amp;lt;?

and, for the condition (2.2.8) together with the Prokhorov’s Theorem 2.2.4, we can extract
a subsequence, still denoted by {??}??N, such that ?? ? ?*, for some ?* ? ?(R). It is easy
to check that ?* ? ?2(R) for, by the Lemma 2.2.5, we know that

??(?*) 6 lim inf
??N

??(??) = ? &amp;lt;?,

which means that ?* ? ?(??) ? ?2(R) and that ?* is a minimum for ??.

The uniqueness of the ground state follows from the Lemma 2.2.5 for, if ?1* and ?2* are
two different minimums in ?2,??(R) to ?? we can define ? 1

the optimal transport map ? ?

&lt;

??(?2*) = ?

which contradicts the definition of ?. If ? = 0, we also know from the Lemma 2.2.5 that ??
is strictly displacement convex, and in this case we also obtain

??(? 1

2

??(?1*) +

??(?2*) = ?.

Therefore, there exists a unique ground state for ??.

2.3 Transport inequalities in dimension 1

We know from Section 2.1 that ? (??) is the minimum value for the energy ? and therefore,
we can use the difference ? (?) ? ? (??) as a measure of distance between any ? ? ?2,??(R)
and the ground state ??. So in this section, we are going to derive several inequalities
originated from optimal transportation theory that will be used in the next section to show
the exponential convergence of ? (?) ? ? (??) to zero in dimension one.

We also know from the relation (2.1.10) that, once we have the following inequality for a
sufficiently large class of functions

? (?) ? ? (??) 6
1

2?
?(?), (2.3.1)

we can prove the exponential convergence of ? (?) ? ? (??) to zero with exponential rate ?2?
(but not necessarily the exponential convergence of ?(?)).

The inequality (2.3.1) is usually called, in the context of optimal transport, Log-Sobolev
inequality in the linear diffusion case or generalized Log-Sobolev inequalities otherwise. We
will revisit (2.3.1) in the next section by investigating the displacement convexity of the
energy ? (?). In particular, it becomes the logarithmic Sobolev inequality [46] for linear
Fokker-Planck equation [7, 28, 73], and a special family of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities
for nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with porous medium type diffusion [37, 26, 29].

Thus for the rest of this section, we shall prove a generalization of (2.3.1) and use it in
the following section to obtain the desired decay for ? (?) ? ? (??).

Now, let us begin with the following technical lemma about the derivative of the Riesz
potential.

44



Lemma 2.3.1. Let 0 &amp;lt;? 6 1 and ? ? ?1(R) ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? &gt; max(1 ? 2?, 0).
Then (????)??? ? ? 1(R) and for any ? ? R,

??(????)???(?) = ??1,?(1 ? 2?)
??
R

? ? ?
|? ? ?|3?2?

(?
?(?) ? ?(?)

)?
?? , if ? ? (0, 1/2) ,

??(????)???(?) = ??1, 12
??
R

? ? ?
|? ? ?|2

(?
?(?) ? ?(?)

)?
?? , if ? =

2

,

or
??(????)???(?) = ??1,?(1 ? 2?)

??
R

? ? ?
|? ? ?|3?2?

?(?) ?? , if ? ? (1/2, 1].

Proof. Firstly, let us assume that ? ? (0, 1/2). To simplify the notation, we write ??(?) :=
?1,?|?|2??1. Hence, we note that under the hypothesis on ?, we have that

u?(?) := ??1,?(1 ? 2?)
??
R

(? ? ?)
|? ? ?|3?2?

(?
?(?) ? ?(?)

)?
?? = ??? * (? ? ?(?))

is well defined for all ? ? R.
Now, let ? ? ? 1(R) be a radial function such that 0 6 ? 6 1, ?(?) = 0 if |?| 6 1, ?(?) = 1

if |?| &gt; 2 and |??| 6 2. Define ??(?) := ?(??1?) and

?(?) := (????)???(?) = ?? * ?(?) ,
??(?) := (????) * ?(?).

Since ? is bounded, we have that ?? ? ? uniformly on R as ? ? 0 for

|?(?) ? ??(?)| 6
??

|???|62?
??(? ? ?)

(?
1 ? ??(? ? ?)

)?
?(?) ??

6 ????
??

|?|62?

1
|?|1?2?

?? = ??????2?

for all ? ? R, where ? depends on ?.
By the smoothness of ???? we know that ?? ? ? 1 and ???(?) = (????)? * ?(?), and since

???? is radial, we can write

???(?) =
??
R
(????)?(? ? ?)

(?
?(?) ? ?(?)

)?
?? .

45



Therefore,

|u?(?) ? ???(?)| =
????
?
??

(??(1 ? ??))?(? ? ?)

??

6 ?1?
?+2??1,

where the constant ?1 only depends on ?, ? and on the Hölder constant of ?. Thus, we also
have that ??? converges uniformly to u? as ? ? 0, and therefore ?? = u?.

Now, if ? ? (1/2, 1] , we only need to adapt the argument in formula (2.3.2) for the
function

u?(?) := ??1,?(1 ? 2?)
??
R

? ? ?
|? ? ?|3?2?

?(?) ?? = ??? * ?

and using that ??? = (????)? * ? in the following way

|u?(?) ? ???(?)| = ? ????
??

|???|62?

(?

|? ? ?|2?2?
+

1
?

1
|? ? ?|1?2?

)?
??

= ?2?2??1,

where the constant ?2 only depends on ? and on the ?? norm of ?.

Finally, if ? = 1/2 we have that

(????)?
1
2 ?(?) = ?1, 12

??
R

log |? ? ?|?(?) ??

and
u 1

2
(?) = ??1, 12

??
R

(? ? ?)
|? ? ?|2

(?
?(?) ? ?(?)

)?
??.

Arguing as above for ? 1
2
(?) := ?1, 12 log |?| we arrive at the following estimates:

|?(?) ? ??(?)| 6 ????
??

|?|62?

???
log |?|

???
?? = ??????

(????

??

6 ???
(?

???

???)?
.

Therefore, since all these estimates are uniform in ?, we conclude that the lemma is true for
all ? ? (0, 1].

Remark 2.3.2. With this expression for the derivative of (????)??? for ? &amp;lt;12 , we obtain
the following equality that shall be used in the next proposition:

??(????)???(?)
?1,?(2? ? 1)

? ? ?

?(?) ??,

where we only used the fact that ?? is radial and ??? is integrable at the infinity. For ? &gt;
1
2 ,

the expression is valid without taking the limit, as the kernel is locally integrable.

The generalization of (2.3.1) that we are going to show is the so called HWI inequality
which is called so because it was first established in [64] and it relates the relative Kullback
information (denoted by ?), the Wasserstein distance ?2 and the relative Fisher information
(also denoted by ?).

The next theorems show that the HWI inequality holds for ? and ?? at least for a class of
bounded and Hölder continuous functions on R. The proof follows the arguments given in [54]
where the same inequality is proved for the case of the logarithmic interaction (? = 1/2) and
strongly relies on the fact that the optimal transport map with respect to the Wasserstein
distance is a monotone nondecreasing function on R. We point out that the convexity of the
confinement due to the drift measured by ? &gt; 0 appears explicitly in the inequalities as in
[25].

Theorem 2.3.3. Let ? ? (0, 1], ? ? R and ? ? ?2,??(R) such that its density (also denoted

47



by ?) satisfies ? ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? &gt; max(1 ? 2?, 0). Then, if ?? the minimum point
of ? on ?2(R), we have

? (?) ? ? (??) 6
??

?(?)?2(?, ??) ?
?

2
? 22 (?, ??).

Proof. For ? = 1/2 this result was proven at [54]. So, let us suppose that ? ? (0, 1/2) and,
to simplify, let us denote ??(?) = ??(????)???(?). Since ? is absolutely continuous with
respect to the Lebesgue measure, by Theorem 2.2.1 there exists an nondecreasing transport
map ? ??? such that ? ??? #? = ??. In order to simplify the notation let us call ? := ? ??? .

Then, we can write

??
?(?)?2(?, ??) ?

?

2
? 22 (?, ??) ? ? (?) + ? (??) = ?1 + ?2 + ?3 ,

where

?1 :=

where we added and subtracted several terms. This allows us to show that ?1 &gt; 0 by the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and ?2 = 0 for all ? ? R. Now, for ?3 let us call ??(?) = ?1,?|?|2??1.
Then, by the Remark 2.3.2

??(?) = lim

The integrand is nonnegative by the convexity of ?? on the positive real line and by the
monotonicity of ?, so ?3 &gt; 0 as well.

If ? ? (1/2, 1], we still have ??(?) = ?1,?|?|2??1 convex because ?1,? is negative in this
range. Thus, the previous computations still apply.

Remarks. 1) It is known that, if the HWI inequality holds for some ? &gt; 0, then the Log-
Sobolev inequality also holds. One just needs to maximize the right-hand side for ?2 &gt; 0 or
use the Young’s inequality for (??

2) Note that in the proof of the Theorem 2.3.3 we did not use the fact that ?? is the

minimum of ? , only the fact that ? (??) &amp;lt;?. In fact, the same inequality holds for any
?0 in the place of ?? as long as ?0 ? ?(? ), and also with ?? in the place of ?, since ?? is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which allows the existence of
the map ? by the Theorem 2.2.1 from page 37. Therefore, if we exchange ? and ?? in the
HWI we obtain the fractional version of the so called Talagrand inequality or transportation
cost inequality

We can derive similar results for the ? functionals.

Theorem 2.3.4. Let ? ? (0, 1], ? &gt; 0, 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?/2?, ? ? ?2,??(R) such that its density (also

denoted by ?) satisfies ? ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? &gt; max(1 ? 2?, 0), and ??? the minimum
point of ?? on ?2(R). Then

Proof. The proof is basically the same, but since we have a new term inside the respective
diffusion, we shall include it for completeness.

As in the previous theorem, let ??(?) = ??(????)???(?) and ? be such that ?#? = ???.
Then, we decompose the inequality as

??
??(?)?2(?, ???) ?

?

By the same arguments, we conclude that ?1, ?3 &gt; 0. Now, for ?2, let us define the
following functional

?(? |?) :=

??

for all nonnegative ?, ? ? ?1(R) with ? &gt; 0. Then we can re-write ?2 in the following way

Note that the second line is equal to (? ? 2??)

for ? &amp;lt;?/2?. For the first line, we can use the proof of the HWI inequality made in [64].
Actually, Otto and Villani showed that whenever ?, ??? ? ? ?? (R) ? ?(R) and ? ? ? 2(R) is

??? ?? = 1 and ? ?? &gt; ? for some constant ? ? R, then

and for the density argument given in the proof of the Theorem 9.17 of [78], we have that
this inequality holds for all ?, ??? ? ?1(R) ? ?2(R). So, applying this for ? (?) = ??2 we have
that ? = 2? and we conclude that ?2 &gt; 0.

Remark 2.3.5. By the same arguments given for (2.3.3) and (2.3.4), we conclude that
the following Log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities hold for ??, as long as ? satisfies the
assumptions of proposition 2.3.4:

Remark 2.3.6. These results also work for a general confinement potential ? : R ? R

2.4 Exponential Convergence

In this section we shall prove that the energy of the solution decays exponentially fast
for the regularized equation with mollified initial data, and then passing the limit on these
regularizing parameters we shall be able to prove the same property for the original problem.
We conclude the section showing that this exponential decay in the energy implies also a
exponential convergence in ?2(R).

51



Let us begin stating our main result.

Theorem 2.4.1. Let ?0 ? ?1(R) ? ??(R) such that

0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| ,

for some constants ?, ? &gt; 0. Then, for each 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2, the solution ?(?, ·) of (2.1.1) with
initial data ?0 satisfies

? (?(?)) ? ? (??) 6 ??2??
(?

? (?0) ? ? (??)
)?

.

We could try to prove this theorem directly since we know from the previous section
that the respective Log-Sobolev inequality holds for the energy ? and then, using the re-
lation (2.1.10) the result would follow by the Gronwall’s inequality. The only problem of
making this argument fully rigorous is that both results demand some smoothness from the
solution and a classic regularity theory for the equation (2.1.1) is still an open problem. In
spite of the result proved in [19] that the weak solutions are Hölder continuous, no esti-
mate was given for the Hölder exponent, and since the Theorem 2.3.3, and consequently the
Log-Sobolev inequality (2.3.3), is valid only for measures whose density belongs to ? ? with
? &gt; 1 ? 2?, the argument above cannot be implemented at the moment. One possible way
of circumventing this regularity issue would be extending the class of measures for which the
HWI inequality holds, but this requires passing limits in the argument of the dissipation term
?, which is delicate, specially for two reasons: firstly because it is still not clear for which
set of measures ? the quantity ?(?) is finite; and secondly, the dissipation is, in general, only
lower semicontinuous, which makes the approximation process hard to implement since this
functional appears on the right hand side of both HWI and Log-Sobolev inequalities. There-
fore, in order to prove the theorem above we will proceed by an approximation argument as
follows: first we will obtain a similar result for an approximate version of the equation (2.1.1)
with an small extra linear diffusion for which we have a good regularity result, and then pass
the limit on the respective exponential decay as this small diffusion term goes to zero. This
approximate equation was also used in [20] to show the existence of weak solutions of the
equation (2.1.2).

Proof of Theorem 2.4.1. In order to use the results of Section 2.3, firstly we shall assume

52



that
?0 ? ? ?(R) and

??
R

?0(?) ?? = 1. (2.4.1)

Let ??, ??? ? ?(R) be the minimizers for ? and ?? respectively. By the assumption on ?0 we
know from the proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 in [20] that the solutions ? and ?? to

??
? ??? = ??(???(????)

??? + ???) , in R × (0, ?)
?(0) = ?0 , in R,

(2.4.2)

and ??
? ???

? = ??(????(????)???? + ????) + ?????? , in R × (0, ?)
??(0) = ?0 , in R

(2.4.3)

satisfy ? ? ?([0, ?); ?1(R)) and ?? ? ? 1((0, ?) × R) for all ? &gt; 0 sufficiently small. It is
also proved in the above mentioned reference that, because of the ?-regularization in (2.4.3)
with a heat term, ??(?, .) is in fact in ? 2(R) for all fixed time ? &gt; 0, and moreover, there exist
?(?), ?(?) &gt; 0, such that

0 6 ?(?, ?) , ??(?, ?) 6 ?(?)???(?)|?|. (2.4.4)

The energy ?? is related to the equation (2.4.3) in the same way as ? is related to (2.4.2).
For example, in both cases the respective energy is nonincreasing with respect to the time
and the steady state solutions coincide with the minimums of the energies.

Since ??(?) is smooth, we can apply the Log-Sobolev Inequality (2.3.5) for ?? and obtain
that for all ? &gt; 0,

??(??(?)) ? ??(???) 6
1

2?
??(??(?)).

Furthermore, making use of the fact that

?

??
??(??(?)) = ???(??(?)), (2.4.5)

we conclude that
??(??(?)) ? ??(???) 6 ?

?2??
(?

??(?0) ? ??(???)
)?

. (2.4.6)

The equality (2.4.5) is easy to show in this case for ??(?) is a classical solution to (2.4.3)
which decays to zero at infinity and hence, defining ?? = ? log ? + ?2 ?

2 + ?? * ? to simplify the

53



notation, we can write the equation as ???? = ??(??????) and we can compute

?

??
??(??) =

?? (?
? log ?????? +

?2 + ?? * ??

)?
???

? ??

=
??

??(?)??(??(?)????(?)) ??

= ?
??

??(?)|????(?)|2 ??

= ??(??).

Now, in order to obtain the desired inequality for the original functional ? we need to
take the limits as ? ? 0+ in (2.4.6). For this, let us analyze each one of the three terms
on (2.4.6) separately:

i) The easiest one is the limit ??(?0), since lim
??0+

??(?0) = ? (?0) holds as long as ? (?0) &amp;lt;?
for some, which is true by the assumptions on ?0.

ii) For the term ??(???), let us first define the following auxiliary functional on ?2,??(R):

?(?) := ?(?|????
2
) = ?

??
?2? +

??
? log ?.

Since
??

????
2
?? = 1, we can write

?(?) =
??

?

????
2 log

(?
?

????
2

)?
????

2
?? =

?? [?
?

????
2 log

(?
?

????
2

)?
?

?

????
2 + 1

]?
????

2
??,

which is nonnegative since the function ? ?? ? log ? ? ? + 1 is nonnegative as well.

Let us prove that lim sup??0 ??(???) 6 ? (??). Using the fact that ??? is the minimum
for ??, we obtain the following inequality

??(???) 6 ??(??) = ? (??) + ?
??

?? log ??. (2.4.7)

By the characterization of the minimum ?? in [21, 32], we know that ?? ? ? 2??(R) ?
??(R), and hence the second term on the right hand side of (2.4.7) is finite. Thus, we
can take the limit ? ? 0 and obtain that lim sup??0+ ??(???) 6 ? (??).

54



For the opposite inequality lim inf ??0+ ??(???) &gt; ? (??), we can use the fact that ?? is
the minimum for ? and write

? (??) 6 ? (???)

= ??(???) + ?? (?
?
?) ? ?

(?
? (???) + ?

??
?2???

)?
+ ??

??
?2???

= ??(???) ? ??(?
?
?) + ??

??
?2???

6 ??(???) + ??
??

?2???. (2.4.8)

So, it is sufficient to prove that the second moments of ??? are uniformly bounded for
? &gt; 0 sufficiently small. For this, note that for all 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;min{?/4?, 1} we have

0 6
?

4

??
?2??? =

?

2
?(???)

6
?

2
?(???) + ??(?

?
?)

=
?

2
?(???) + 2???(?

?
?) + ? ? (?

?
?)

6 ??(???) + ? ? (?
?
?) + ?(?

?
?)

= ??(???) 6 ??(??) 6 ? (??) +
??????

?? log ??
????
.

Therefore, taking the limit as ? ? 0+ in (2.4.8) we obtain

? (??) 6 lim inf
??0+

??(???) + lim
??0+

??
??

?2??? = lim inf
??0+

??(???).

Hence, as ? goes to zero from above, we have that the minimum of ??(?) indeed converge
to the minimum of ? (?), i.e., ? (??) = lim

??0+
??(???).

iii) Finally, let us prove that ? (?(?)) 6 lim inf ??0+ ??(??(?)) as a consequence of the con-
vergence of ??(?) to ?(?) in ?2,??(R) and the lower semi-continuity of the energy ??. For
this we can use the bound (2.4.4) to obtain

lim
???

sup
??N

??
|?|&gt;?

??? (?, ?)?? 6 lim
???

?(?)
??

|?|&gt;?
???(?)|?|?? = 0,

for every sequence ?? ? 0, which means that ??? (?) is a tight family of probability

55



measures and by Prokhorov’s Theorem 2.2.4, there exist a subsequence, still denoted
by ??, that such that ??? (?) ? ?(?), i.e.,

??
R

?(?)??? (?, ?) ?? ?
??
R

?(?)?(?, ?) ?? , for all ? ? ??(R) (2.4.9)

Moreover, due to uniform exponential bound, we also have that

lim
???

sup
??N

??
|?|&gt;?

?2??? (?, ?)?? 6 lim
???

?(?)
??

|?|&gt;?
?2???(?)|?|?? = 0. (2.4.10)

Therefore, by (2.2.6) from the Theorem 2.2.3 we have that (2.4.9) and (2.4.10) imply
that ??? (?) converges to ?(?) in (?2(R), ?2). Note that, by (2.4.4), the second moments
are uniformly bounded w. r. t. ? so, from the following inequality

? (??? (?)) = ??? (?
?? (?)) ? ???(??? (?)) + ???

??
?2??? (?, ?) 6 ??? (?

?? ) + ???
??

?2??? (?, ?),

and by the fact that ? is lower semi-continuous in (?2(R), ?2), we obtain

? (?(?)) 6 lim inf
???

? (??? (?)) 6 lim inf
???

??? (?
?? (?)).

Putting all the limits together as ? goes to zero, we can conclude the exponential convergence
of ? (?(?)) ? ? (??), that is,

? (?(?)) ? ? (??) 6 lim inf
???

??? (?
?? (?)) ? lim

???
??? (?

)?

6 ??2?? lim inf
???

(?
??? (?0) ? ??? (?

?
?)
)?

= ??2??
(?

? (?0) ? ? (??)
)?

.

If the regularity assumption in (2.4.1) is not true, we can proceed the above argument
with the mollified initial data ?0,? = ?? * ?0, which has the same bound and mass as ?0. Since
we still have the same exponential bounds for the respective solutions ??(?), we can argue as
above and conclude that ? (?(?)) 6 lim inf ??0 ? (??(?)) holds for all ? &gt; 0. For ? = 0 we can
use the exponential bound of the initial data and the Dominated Convergence Theorem to
conclude that lim??0 ? (??,0) = ? (?0).

56



As a direct consequence of the Talagrand inequality in (2.3.4), we also obtain the expo-
nential decay in Wasserstein distance.

Corollary 2.4.2. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some
?, ? &gt; 0. Then, for each 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2, the solution of (2.1.1) with initial data ?0 satisfies

?2(?(?), ??) 6 ????
??

2
?

(?
? (?0) ? ? (??)

)?
.

For the Fokker-Planck equation or the classic Porous Medium Equations, exponential
convergence of the relative entropy ? (?) ? ? (??) implies convergence of ? to the steady
states ?? in some classical ?? norms, using for this the classical Csiszár-Kullback-Pinsker
inequality as in [7, 29]. Here we can show that the convergence in the relative entropy implies
the convergence of the norm ?(????)?

?
2 (? ? ??)??2 .

Lemma 2.4.3. Let ?? be the unique minimizer of ? , then for any ? ? ?2(R),

1
2

?(????)?
?
2 (? ? ??)?2?2 ? ? (?) ? ? (??).

Proof. The characterization (2.1.13a) and (2.1.13b) of the global minimizer ?? and the non-
negativity of ? ? ?? outside of the support of ?? imply that

0 = ?*
??
R
(? ? ??) ?

??
R

(?

(? ? ??).

Therefore, we deduce

?(????)?
?
2 (? ? ??)?2?2 .

Since ?(????)?
?
2 (? ? ??)??2 is the ? ??/2-norm of ? ? ??, it is unlikely to produce a

bound on any stronger ?? norm for the difference ? ? ??. One way to show the exponential
convergence of ?(?) to ?? is to assume a uniform bound on a higher order norm of ? ? ??.

57



For example, if ?(????)
?
2 (? ? ??)??2 is uniformly bounded, then we have (easy to establish

in Fourier space)

?? ? ???2?2 ? ?(????)
?
2 (? ? ??)??2 ?(????)?

?
2 (? ? ??)??2

and ?? ? ????2 converges to zero also exponentially fast, but with a smaller rate.
Let us prove that in fact the exponential convergence also holds in ?2 without any addi-

tional hypothesis. For this, since (????)?
?
2 ? usually has more regularity than ?, we need to

look for an interpolation inequality containing some sort of fractional differentiation, which in
our case, it seems natural to be a Hölder semi-norm, i.e., for every ? ? (0, 1] and ? ? ? ?(R)
we denote the ?-Hölder semi-norm of ? by

[?]?? := sup
? ?=?

|?(?) ? ?(?)|
|? ? ?|?

.

Therefore, to obtain the desired decay in ?2 we shall use the following new interpolation
inequality, that we will prove for any dimension ? &gt; 1. The idea for this result was given by
Carrillo and Vázquez.

Theorem 2.4.4. Let 0 &amp;lt;? 6 1 and 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?/2 and 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?/2. There exists a constant
? = ?(?, ?, ?) such that

2(? + ?)(? + ?)

, ?3 =
?(? + 2? ? 2?)
2(? + ?)(? + ?)

.

In order to prove the Theorem above we are going to need the following result about
fractional Sobolev Spaces:

Proposition 2.4.5 (See propositions 3.4 and 3.6 of [39]). Let ? ? (0, 1) and ? ? (R?) the
Banach space defined by

? ? (R?) :=

Then, there exists a constant ?(?, ?) depending only on ? and ? such that

|???(?)|2|?|2? ?? = ?(?, ?)?1?(??) ?2 ???2 ; , (2.4.12)
for all ? ? ? ? (R?), where ??? is the Fourier transform of ?.
Proof of Theorem 2.4.4. For all 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;?/2, ? &gt; 0 and ?1 = ?/(? + ?), we can use Fourier
variables, Plancherel’s formula, the Hölder’s inequality with the conjugate pair

(?

and (2.4.12) to interpolate between [?]? ? and (??)?

? (2.4.14)

We finally use the classical interpolation results between ??(R?) and ? ?(R?) spaces due to
L. Nirenberg in [62], see also [17] for a full statement. This interpolation inequality ensures
the existence of a constant depending on ? and ? such that

???2?2 6 ? ???

?/(?+?)

Putting it together with (2.4.14), it yields

which concludes the proof.

Therefore, from Theorem 2.4.1 and Theorem 2.4.4, we derive the following decay towards
the stationary state under the ?2 norm.

Corollary 2.4.6. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some
?, ? &gt; 0. Then, for each 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2, the solution of (2.1.1) with initial data ?0 satisfies

??(?) ? ????2 6 ? (1 + [??]?)
?2 (? (?0) ? ? (??))

?1
2 ????1? .

Proof. Given ?0 under the conditions above, we know from Theorem 5.1 of [19] that there
exists an ? ? (0, 1) such that the solution ? of (2.1.1) satisfies ?(?) ? ? ? (R) ? ??(R) for all
? &gt; 0 with a uniform bound in time. Since ?? is bounded and (1 ? ?)-Hölder continuous,
we have that ?(?) := ?(?) ? ?? ? ? ?(R) for all ? &gt; 0 with ? ? min{?, 1 ? ?}. So we can
use inequality (2.4.11) for ? and 0 &amp;lt;2? &amp;lt;?, the Lemma 2.4.3 and the Theorem 2.4.1 to
conclude

??(?) ? ????2 6 ??(??)

6 ?????1? (? (?0) ? ? (??))
?1/2 (1 + [??]?? )

?2 .

Let us point out that the decay of the entropy in Theorem 2.4.1 implies a uniform in time
control of the second moment of the solutions trivially at least for 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2. Otherwise,
one has to work a bit due to the sign of the constant in the fractional operator. In any case,
a uniform in time control of the second moments together with the ?2-decay rates implies
?1-decay rates. For the next result, a similar calculation was performed in [27, Lemma 2.24].

61



Corollary 2.4.7. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some
?, ? &gt; 0. Then, for each 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1/2, the solution of (2.1.1) with initial data ?0 satisfies

where the last inequality follows from the fact that the energy ? is decreasing. Now, choosing

We finally remark that the decay in ??-norms obtained via Corollary 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 are
translated through the change of variables (2.1.6)-(2.1.7) into algebraic decay rates toward
self-similar solutions of the original fractional porous medium equation (2.1.2).
