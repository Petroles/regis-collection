RESUMO 

 

O presente trabalho visou desenvolver uma rota alternativa para 

produção de matrizes porosas de cerâmicas óxidas para aplicação em 

materiais compósitos. Para tanto, foram realizadas caracterizações para 

obter uma suspensão de partículas cerâmicas, estável e com viscosidade 

dentro de um valor desejável. Igualmente, foram feitas caracterizações 

para o tratamento térmico, ao qual as matérias-primas são submetidas, 

envolvendo análise térmica diferencial e termogravimetria. Análise de 

imagem foi aplicada à matriz cerâmica produzida. Por se tratar de um 

processo de sinterização reativa, foram determinados os parâmetros de 

cinética de oxidação. O processo desenvolvido se baseia na obtenção de 

uma matriz óxida através da oxidação indireta de uma fase secundária, 

formada a partir de um pó metálico. Dentre os resultados alcançados 

podem-se citar: porosidade obtida dentro dos valores esperado, i.e. 

~50%; parâmetro de Weibull de 10,54, ?0 de 14,15 MPa com ?max de 

16,1 MPa; Energia de ativação de oxidação do carbeto de alumínio 

isolado de 129,65 kJ/mol em baixa temperatura e 16,91 kJ/mol em alta 

temperatura.

ABSTRACT 

 

The present work focuses mainly on the development of an alternative 

novel route for production of oxide ceramic matrices for application in 

composite material. In this context, the following characterizations were 

carried out: viscosity determinations for obtaining stable/ homogenous 

slurry with desired viscosity; thermal treatment set points 

determinations, which involve thermogravimetric analyses and 

differential thermal analyses; morphology characterization of the 

produced oxide porous ceramic matrix. Due to the fact that the 

production route is related to reaction bonding then oxidation kinetics 

parameters were also determined. An oxide-based process was 

developed, wherein a final oxide phase is produced through the indirect 

oxidation of an intermediate phase, which is formed from metallic 

powder. The main results found were: porosity within the expected 

values, i.e. ~50%; Weibull parameter of 10.54, ?0 of 14.15 MPa with 

?max of 16.1 MPa; Activation energy of oxidation of the isolated 

aluminum carbide of 129.65 kJ/mol at lower temperatures and of 16.91 

kJ/mol at higher temperatures.

1 INTRODUCTION  

Modern structural ceramic composites possess a number of unique 

properties that cannot be achieved by any single material. For instance, 

composites can bear moderate loads at high temperatures, i.e. 1200°C 

(CHAWLA, 1993), and at room temperature they may present damage 

tolerance characteristics. They have a potential for saving energy, 

reducing wear, and increasing the lifetime of components (JANSSEN, et 

al., 2008). Conversely, regardless of their excellent properties, structural 
ceramics are not as widely used in industry as they should and could be. 

Among the reasons for the reluctance of industry to introduce structural 

ceramic as components are (JANSSEN, et al., 2008): 

? high price of ceramic parts,  

? insufficient knowledge in “traditional” metal-oriented 
engineering,  

? low toughness,  

? need to redesign components to meet specific ceramic 
requirements. 

There are a number of examples where components based on ceramic 

composites have been designed and tested successfully, but, despite their 

superior properties, they have not been put into production, basically due 

to their high price. In some cases machining costs can account for 80% 

of the overall manufacturing costs of a ceramic component. (KLOCKE, 

1997)  

Challenging approaches are provided by synthesis routes which exhibit 

reduced shrinkage, and capabilities for shaping by machining in the 

green state. In this case, reactive processing routes like reaction bonding 

of aluminium oxide (RBAO), sintered alumina aluminide alloys (3A) are 

good examples. These techniques have been developed at Advanced 

Ceramics Institute of the Technological University of Hamburg-Harburg 

(TUHH - Technische Universität Hamburg-Harburg) (CLAUSSEN, et 

al., 1990), (CLAUSSEN and WU, 1992), (WU, et al., 1993), 

(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002),(JANSSEN, et al., 

2008). 

Fibre reinforcement of ceramics is a concept which has attracted a lot of 

interest, especially in the automotive and aerospace industry. The 

essential requirements for fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites 

(FRCMC) are high temperature stability, oxidation resistance and 

damage tolerance (JANSSEN, et al., 2008). For non-oxide matrices, 
reinforcement is especially performed with long-fibre (Cf-SiC) 



2 

 

composites with suitable rupture behaviour (JANSSEN, 2007). At high 

temperature and long time applications (i.e. burners, turbine 

components, structural insulations, etc.) the stability of those materials in 

oxygen atmosphere is still a feature that limit their broader application.  

In the last few years, researches concentrated on complex coatings for 

oxidation protection of the components (internal) or of the entire 

prefabricated part (external), for use in oxygen rich atmospheres, such as 

for combustion processes. At present, it is not yet unequivocally clarified 

whether a damage tolerant fibre composite can actually be produced 

with these concepts. Therefore, most commercial applications of carbon 

fibre reinforced silicon carbide (Cf-SiC) are focused yet on systems 

where the average service temperature in air is quite moderate (i.e. brake 

disc rotors in advanced sport cars). Oxide-Oxide FRCMCs are therefore 

an attractive alternative.  

Polycrystalline oxide fibres although are still limited in maximum 

service temperature when compared to carbon or (very expensive) 

silicon carbide fibres like High Nicalon. Therefore, research on these 

composites has been running for more than a decade (EVANS and ZOK, 

1994). The production problems are yet not solved and only some oxide-

oxide FRCMCs are produced in lab in a very small scale 

(WESTWOOD, et al., 1996). This work will focus, therefore, on the 

development of a novel route for porous ceramic matrix production by 

combining features of proven effective techniques. 

 

1.1 MOTIVATION 

The motivation of this research project was the opportunity of combine 

features of two proven techniques for develop and adapt a novel route 

for production of porous ceramic materials. Particularly in this study the 

novel route was adapted for producing porous matrix material for 

composites, although the technique may be directed for some other 

applications. This work concerned in ensuring the successful 

development of the production steps for obtaining desired phases 

through within the processing cycles.

The prime objective of this work is to develop a porous ceramic material 

to be used as porous ceramic matrix. This matrix has to present stable 

porosity and a specific microstructure to enable damage tolerant 

behaviour and also has to exhibit a desirable mechanical behaviour at 

high temperatures.  



3 

The following specific objectives are to be achieved: 

? Development of a method for obtaining a ceramic matrix, in 
which a controlled porosity and a tailored microstructure are 

generated consisting on mullite particles surrounded by finer 

alumina particles. The desired porosity ranges from 20% to 

50%. The desired mullite particle size ranges from 5 to 15 µm 

and the alumina particles are expected to be a finer particulate 

dispersed around the mullite particles. 

? Definition of viscosity properties of the slurry to be used in the 
composite panel infiltration process; 

? Definition of the setup of production route for 
reaction/oxidation/sintering thermal treatment; 

? Evaluation of mechanical properties of the produced matrix by 
Weibull statics. 

? Characterization of the matrix morphology in order to determine 
how particles of alumina are distributed within the matrix 

material. 

? Determination of oxidation kinetics of the intermediate phase, 
i.e. activation energy of oxidation.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

Reaction-bonding as well as ceramic composites fabrication techniques 

will be reviewed in this chapter. 

 

2.1 REACTION BONDING TECHNIQUES 

Ceramics are well known as brittle materials. Fracture toughness of most 

ceramics does not exceed values of 10 MPa  . However, the 
application of sophisticated processing techniques, limiting typical flaw 

sizes, reducing heterogeneities to a micrometre scale, enables attainment 

of flexural strength up to a GPa range. According to Knechtel and co-

wokers, the reliability of structural ceramics can be controlled by at least 

four mechanisms with dissimilar degrees of efficiency, e.g. distribution 

of defect size, R-curve effects, stress induced plasticity and reduced flaw 

size (KNECHTEL, et al., 1995). Those controlling parameters are within 

reaction bonding techniques, which may produce very clear grain 

boundaries, with very fine dispersed grains. 

The characteristic feature of reaction bonding techniques is the involved 

reaction, which occurs during the heat treatment schedule. Reaction-

Bonded Aluminium Oxide (RBAO) and Reaction-Bonded Mullite 

(RBM) are examples of such techniques. The properties and processing 

of reaction-bonded ceramics are presented in the literature (CLAUSSEN 

and WU, 1992). RBAO and RBM compacts exhibit low shrinkage, and 

very distinctive mechanical properties due to their microstructure 

morphology. Reaction Bonding techniques can be modified to produce 

zirconia–toughened RBAO, for instance, among other composite 

ceramics. Nevertheless, the RB processes exhibit different fundaments 

and features in comparison with directed metal oxidation (CLAUSSEN 

and WU, 1992). While conventional sintered products present a 

shrinkage range from 15 to 20%, the RB techniques exhibit nearly zero 

shrinkage, which makes them suitable for application where near net 

shape plays an important role. The almost zero shrinkage feature comes 

from the expansion associated with the oxidation of the raw-materials, 

wherein metallic particles amounts of up to 60 vol.% are combined with 

the other raw materials. Some additives are employed so that the kinetics 

of oxidation is modified in order to ease the process. Those metallic 

particles may easily oxidize during milling, which may be avoided in a 

closed milling system. The same approach is applied to mechanical 

alloying of intermetallics, i.e. attrition milling. The milled powder is 

then dried and pressed, which cause the Al and Al2O3 particles to form 



5 

contacts by bridging. This is the reason why those compacts can present 

high green strength, e.g. 20-50 MPa, which are values far higher than 

those of conventional ceramic green bodies. In heating treatment, the 

compacts undergo not only sintering mechanisms, but also solid state 

oxidation, which balances and hinders compact shrinkage. In RB 

techniques where the near net shape is not a highlighted property, the 

shrinkage can reach at most 5%.  

Completely reaction-bonded bodies usually exhibit 3 to 8% 

homogeneously distributed micropores with sizes lower than 1 ?m. 

Those compacts can exhibit mechanical strength up to 500 MPa, 94.5% 

theoretical density and may present up to 20 vol.% ZrO2 as reinforcing 

phase.  

As previously mentioned, RB techniques can be modified in various way 

by either metal, e.g. Zr, Cr, Si etc, or ceramic additives, e.g. ZrO2, 

Cr2O3, MgO, SiC etc. Depending on the selected modification the RB 

compact can either present a low shrinkage, e.g. RBAO or Zirconia-

Toughened Alumina; a near net shape, e.g. Reaction Bonded 

Aluminium/Chromium Oxide; or even a slightly expansion, e.g. RBM 

(CLAUSSEN and WU, 1992). 

 

 

2.1.1 RBAO technique 

Authors in literature (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1989) addressed the 

fabrication of reaction-bonded alumina with near zero shrinkages (&lt;1%). 

In this case, the samples of attrition-milled Al/Al2O3 powder mixtures 

are heat treated at temperatures between 1200 and 1550°C, so that the 

expansion due to the Al ? Al2O3 reaction and the sintering shrinkage of 

Al2O3 are nearly balanced. Those authors also addressed a shrinkage of 

~14% for samples made out of 100% Al2O3, regarding the same powder 

particles distribution and heat treatment schedule. 

Later on (WU and CLAUSSEN, 1990) a reduction of mullite-zirconia 

ceramics was proposed by combining the RBAO reaction with the 

reaction of zircon (ZrSiO4) with Al2O3adding metallic aluminium 

powder to the mixture. Although the produced compacts presented lower 

shrinkage, they showed higher porosity and lower toughness mechanical 

strength. The final properties were 350 MPa strength, 4.5 MPa   
toughness and 13.5% porosity. On the other hand, modified samples 

presented 250 MPa, 2.5 MPa   and 5.5%, of strength, toughness and 
porosity, respectively. 



6 

 

Tailoring of reaction-bonded Al2O3 ceramics is reported in the literature 

(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1990). Authors discussed possible mechanisms of 

microstructural development and of composite formation. Attrition 

milled Al/Al2O3 compacts with 50% and 35 vol.% of Al were heat 

treated and yielded theoretical density of 93% and strength of 350 MPa. 

The microstructure exhibited a homogeneous distribution of fine (&gt;1?m) 

closed pores. They also addressed the hazard decreasing level of the 

process due to the passivation of the surface, which comes from the 

heavily comminuted Al particles (~1?m). This intensive milling of 

particles is carried out in organic media, i.e. acetone, at temperatures of 

12°C. The small additions of zirconia, up to 5 vol.%, lead to 

considerably reducing in reaction bonding times. Even though Al 

powder presented some impurities, e.g. Si, Mn etc, no intergranular glass 

phase was observed by TEM (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1990). 
According to Claussen, Wu and Janssen, the RBAO process starts from 

precursor mixtures consisting of Al and Al2O3 (CLAUSSEN, et al., 
1989), (WU, et al., 1993), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002). In practically all 

cases, ZrO2 is added to enhance oxidation and to improve microstructure 

and mechanical properties of the final product. The precursor mixtures 

are intensively milled in order to reduce the particle size, mainly that of 

Al, and to achieve a high degree of homogenization. Green bodies for 

RBAO contain about 30–45 vol. % of aluminium which bonds the 

alumina particles so that binder additions are not required. RBAO 

powder compacts reach substantially high-green strength, i.e., isostatic 

compaction at pressures as low as 170MPa is sufficient to obtain green 

bodies with high strength (20MPa in 4-point bending) that can be 

extensively green machined to complex shapes and down to very low 

wall thickness values below 50 µm. (JANSSEN, et al., 2002) After 

machining, the green compacts are subjected to a two-step heat 

treatment in air in order to first oxidize Al and then sinter the material. 

The oxidation of Al is associated with a 28% volume expansion and 

together with the high-green densities (typically &gt;60% T.D., up to 75% 

possible) this leads to a reduced sintering shrinkage of about 10–15%. 

The newly formed, very fine Al2O3 sinters and bonds the originally 

added Al2O3. The sintered material has typical grain sizes of 1–1.5 µm 

and 0.5 µm for Al2O3 and ZrO2, respectively. RBAO composites tested 

without any machining, i.e., as fired, using a “Punch-on-Three-

Equiaxed-Balls” test configuration exhibit typical strength values of 700 

MPa after pressureless sintering and &gt;1 GPa after HIPing. (JANSSEN, 

et al., 2002).  



7 

The process can be modified in various ways, e.g. to form reaction-

bonded mullite (RBM). 

  

2.1.2 RBM technique 

In the case of RBM process, SiC instead of Al2O3 is added to the 

precursor powder (WU and CLAUSSEN, 1990), (SCHEPPOKAT, et al., 
1998), (SCHEPPOKAT, et al., 1999). The large volume increase (108%) 

associated to the SiC oxidation together with the 28% volume increase 

from Al oxidation make extremely low (&lt;0.2% linear) sintering 

shrinkage possible, provided the green density is high (&gt;72% T.D.). 

RBM may attain strength values of 250 MPa. 

 

2.1.3 3A technique 

As far as powder preparation is concerned, this process is similar to the 

RBAO process, however, it includes a redox reaction between 

aluminium and the oxide of another metal (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996), 
(GARCIA, et al., 1998), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002), (SCHEPPOKAT, et 

al., 2005). The basic reaction can be written as 

(s) a b(s) y(s) 2 3(s)Al Me O MexAl Al O? ? ?  1 

Sintering has to take place under vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to 

prevent reaction between Al with oxygen and nitrogen from atmosphere. 

Examples of application of oxides, which were found in literature, are 

Cr2O3, Fe2 O3, Nb2O5, TiO2, and ZrO2(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996). The 

process can be modified by using a metallic material, such as Cr, Fe, or 

Mo, instead of the metal oxide, and adding only a small amount (?1 wt. 

%) of Al for sinter kinetics assisting (JANSSEN, et al., 2008). This 
version of the 3A process has the advantage that the highly exothermic 

redox reaction takes place only on a very small scale, i.e., between Al 

and the oxide layer on particles of the other metal, so that higher heating 

rates can be used. Advantages of the 3A process are high-green strength 

allowing green machining, pressureless sintering, and compositional 

flexibility (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996). 

 

2.1.4 Other reaction bonding techniques 

Other types of reaction bonding techniques are found in literature, for 

instance, Silicon Nitride (TRAVITZKY and CLAUSSEN, 1992), 

Aluminium Niobate and Cromate (GARCIA, et al., 1998) (GARCIA, et 
al., 1999). Applying reaction bonding route for silicon nitride causes the 

material to improve its mechanical properties, e.g. strength raised to 510 



8 

 

MPa, and when infiltrated with a Ti-39 wt% Al alloy the toughness 

raised to &gt; 5 MPa  .  
 

2.2 ALUMINIUM CARBIDE 

The creep strength of the aluminium carbide particles-reinforced silicon 

carbide matrix composites increases with the volume fraction of 

aluminium carbide particles dispersed in the matrix. It can be accounted 

for, almost exclusively, by the effect of this fraction on the threshold 

stress (ZHU, et al., 2000). Aluminium carbide can be used as an abrasive 

in high-speed cutting tools due to its high hardness, i.e. approximately 

the hardness of topaz.(SAVEKER and BONNELL, 2000). Aluminium 

carbide is also suitable for grain refinement of Mg alloys with only 5% 

additions of Al4C3, which in turn act as nuclei for heterogeneous 

nucleation for Mg alloys phases (NIMITYONGSKUL, et al., 2010). It is 

moreover used for strengthening Al alloys present a very particular creep 

behaviour, with a lower and a higher temperature variation, which in 

turn can be predicted by models found in literature (GURJAR, et al., 
1993) and follow a power law creep (DOBEŠ, et al., 2012).  

Wand and co-workers (WANG, et al., 2004) evaluated the reaction 

between Al and C in binary alloys by means of Differential Scanning 

Calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD), Figure 1.  

 

 

Figure 1 - DSC of non isothermal Al4C3 formation (WANG, et al., 2004). 



9 

According to the authors the wide peak between 688°C and 1122°C is 

related to the aluminium carbide formation. The reaction between Al and 

C is dependent on the type of carbon structure. The higher the contact 

area, the more complete is the carbide reaction (BESTERCI and 

PARILÁK, 2004) (BESTERCI, 2006). 

 

2.3 ALUMINIUM VAPOUR INFILTRATION  

Aluminium vapour infiltration is a technique that provides final parts 

with well defined structures replicated from the original template 

(RAMBO and SIEBER, 2005). Although this technique is more suitable 

to build ceramic structures from biotemplates rather than other liquid 

infiltration techniques, it is also suitable to produce a very fine grain-size 

ceramic phase due to the chemical reaction among the aluminium and 

carbon powder. Some works report the final structure of those 

biotemplated ceramics (Figure 2). 

 

Figure 2 - Carbon preform used in aluminium vapour infiltration (a) and 

respective porous ceramic structure produced (b). (BERTI, 2008).

10 

 

 

The carbon structure used in this technique presented bimodal pore size 

distribution with average pore size of 10 and 50 µm (see Figure 2 a) and 

b)). The resulted final structures showed a well defined replication of the 

carbon perform. The structure walls are formed by a very fine sized 

particle of alumina. 

The reactions that take place during the heat treatment are carbide 

formation followed by oxidation. Those reactions convert aluminium 

powder in aluminium oxide, according to the following equations: 

? Al4C3 formation (equation 2): 

(s) (s) 4 3(s)4Al + 3C Al C?  2  

? Al2O3 formation by Al4C3 oxidation (equation 3): 

4 3(s) 2(g) 2 3(s) (g)Al C 9O 4Al O 6CO? ? ?  3 

 

2.4 REACTION KINETICS 

Reaction kinetics is determined by measuring either the amount of metal 

consumed or by the amount of oxygen consumed or even by the amount 

of oxide produced (BIRKS, et al., 2006) (YOUNG, 2008). In practical 
terms only the oxygen comsuption can be continuously assessed. 

Thermogravimetry allows the metal comsuption to be measured. To 

determine the oxidation kinetics, any of above mentioned methods can 

provide quantitative parameters. The principal rate laws of reaction 

kinetics are (BIRKS, et al., 2006): 
? Linear law, for which the rate of reaction is 

independent of time, is found predominantly in 

reactions whose rate is controlled by a surface-

reaction step or by diffusion through the gas 

phase. 

? Parabolic law, for which the rate is inversely 
proportional to the square root of time, is found 

when diffusion through the scale is the rate-

determining process. 

? Logarithmic law, which is only observed for the 
formation of very thin films of oxide, i.e., between 

2 and 4 nm, and is generally associated with low 

temperatures. 

Additionally, some systems may even present combined reaction 

kinetics laws, e.g. oxidation of niobium in air, at 1000°C initially 

follows a parabolic law and later becomes linear. 



11 

2.4.1 Oxidation kinetics 

In the last decade several materials have been studied regarding their 

oxidation kinetics, e.g. carbides (GOZZI, et al., 1998), phosphated iron 
(REBEYRAT, et al., 2000), nickel (NIKLASSON and KARMHAG, 

2003), and nitrides (XINMEI and KUO-CHIH, 2009) among others. 

Moreover, mathematical models are also presented in literature 

(BROCK and PRYOR, 1973) (DOILNITSYNA, 2002) (CHOU, 2006). 

Nickel particles with varying sizes were submitted to isothermal 

oxidation by thermogravimetric experiments (RASHIDI, 2011). In this 

study weight gain kinetics was evaluated regarding specific area. An 

activation energy of ~108 kJ/mol was found for both the nano and 

micro-sized particles. A theoretical modelling involving the contribution 

of grain boundary diffusion was in good agreement with experimental 

results. Oxidation kinetics of free and matrix enclosed nickel particles 

exhibited dissimilar activation energies of oxidation (BROCK and 

PRYOR, 1973), (KARMHAG, et al., 2000).  
Kinetic modelling of oxidation of aluminium in oxygen and its 

morphology has been extensively studied with heating rates of 1 to 40 

K/min (BECK, et al., 1966) (RAI, et al., 2006) (SCHOENITZ, et al., 
2010). The activation energy of oxidation was found to occur in two 

stages, depending on the heating rates applied. Values found were 

393±108 and 341±105 kJ/mol for the first and second oxidation stages, 

respectively, using 5 K/min. The higher the heating rates, the lower the 

activation energy of oxidation, both in the first and in the second stage. 

Additionally, the energy of activation value becomes more imprecise 

with the application of higher heating rates. Moreover, the activation 

energy for combustion of aluminium nanoparticles is smaller than that of 

a bulk aluminium sample (AUMANN, et al., 1995). Corroborating to the 

last statement, the activation energy of oxidation reached 196.8±14.8 

and 127.3±9.5 for micro- and nanosized aluminium particles, 

respectively (PIVKINA, et al., 2004). Those values are not in agreement 

to those presented by (PARK, et al., 2005).  
Studies found in literature have evaluated the oxidation energy of 

oxidation of aluminium particles within RBAO mixtures (WU, et al., 
1993) (SUVACI, et al., 2004). An oxidation activation energy of 222 

kJ/mol was found (AARON, et al., 2005) , and aluminium particle 

oxidation was claimed independent on particle size.  

Boron carbide activation energy presented values of 209.4±11.4, 

212.7±35.8 and 219.2±45.3 kJ/mol for fine, medium and coarse particle 



12 

 

sizes, respectively, as measured by isothermal thermogravimetric 

experiments (LI. and QIU, 2007). 

Soot particles with size resolved oxidation kinetics presented values of 

164 kJ/mol for activation energy of oxidation of nanosized particles 

(HIGGINS, et al., 2002). 

Silicon nitride oxidation kinetics was 310±25 kJ/mol and depending on 

the temperature it exhibiteds parabolic (lower than 1250°C) and non-

parabolic rate law (higher than 1300°C) (PERSSON, et al., 1993). 
Additionally, when impure silicon nitride is oxidized in dry air or dry 

oxygen, a protective oxide is formed, which retards further oxidation. 

Parabolic rate law is observed for such materials (HORTON, 1969). 

In SiC particles-reinforced aluminium matrix composites, the interaction 

at high temperature between solid- or liquid aluminium and silicon 

carbide crystals always proceeded via dissolution-precipitation 

mechanisms (VIALA, et al., 1993).  

Direct oxidation of Al-Mg alloys in Mg matrices presented activation 

energy of 361 kJ/mol. That alloy firstly reacts with Al-Mg and then 

oxidized into spinel phases (VENUGOPALAN, et al., 1996).  

Silicon carbide activation energy of oxidation was found as 118 kJ/mol 

(HOU, et al., 2009). In this study, a mathematical model was also 

suggested. The oxidation of such material also presented dependency on 

the vicinity material (LIU, 1997). The higher the amount of yttrium 

aluminium garnet, the lower the energy of activation of oxidation of 

silicon carbide particles(QUANLI, et al., 2007).  
In carbon long fibre-reinforced carbon matrix composites, silicon is 

infiltrated for enhancing oxidation. Those composites are dependent not 

only on the composite microstructure and fibre architecture, but also on 

the tensile strength in oxidizing environments (LAMOUROUX, et al., 

1995). 

 

2.5 COMPOSITES 

Composite materials have unique combination of properties, i.e. wear 

resistance, strength at high temperature, and damage tolerance. 

Composites are applied in several engineering fields, e.g. aerospace, gas 

turbines, automotive, and biomedical. The properties of composites are 

selected due to its very specific characteristics, which have to fit to the 

application, and simple comparisons between those properties might 

yield in wrong interpretation. If the ultimate bending strength of an 

oxide ceramic composite, i.e. ~200MPa, is compared to the ultimate 

bending strength of a monolithic ceramic, i.e. 1000MPa, it may be 



13 

considered that the composite has a fifth of the monolithic material 

value. This is true, however, it is not a fair material selection 

comparison. A composite material might present lower strength in 

comparison with its monolithic material, but it also show damage 

tolerance and it also present better mechanical properties at higher 

temperatures, i.e. strength, creep and fatigue properties. Therefore, the 

complete comparison must be taken into account for a correct 

interpretation. 

Composites can be classified according to its matrix material type in: 

? Metal Matrix Composites (MMC), in which a metal is a matrix 
phase, e.g. aluminium, magnesium, iron, cobalt, copper; and a 

dispersed ceramic or metallic phase, e.g. oxides, carbides, 

tungsten or molybdenum; 

? Polymeric Matrix Composites (PMC), in which apply a 
thermoplastic or set polymer is the matrix phase, e.g. nylon, 

polysterene, unsaturated polyester, or epoxy; and a embedded 

glass, carbon, steel or Kevlar fibres as reinforcement. Fibres are 

commercially available in several patterns, which are selected 

according to the specific application; 

? Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), in which a non-oxide or 
oxide ceramic is the matrix phase, e.g. silicon carbide, silicon 

nitride, alumina, or mullite; and a embedded non-oxide or oxide 

fibre reinforcement, such as carbon, carbides, sapphire, alumina, 

mullite, as reinforcement. Those fibres are also available in 

several patterns.  

Further classification can be given to particulate composites according to 

geometrical and spatial characteristics (CALLISTER, 2000), 

(CALLISTER, 2006): 

? Concentration; 

? Size; 

? Shape; 

? Distribution, which relates how particles organize themselves 
with the matrix; 

? Orientation, which relates how particles orientate themselves 
according to the frame axis. 

The relation between reinforcement and matrix phase is also classified 

according to geometrical and spatial characteristics: 

? Particle-reinforced composites, which may present large 
particles or dispersion-strengthened particles; 



14 

 

? Fibre-reinforced composites, which may present continuous and 
aligned fibres or discontinuous aligned and randomly oriented 

fibres.  

? Structural composites, which may present laminates forms or 
sandwich panel. 

The correct decision of which composite may be used in a specific 

application is a function of the combination of the composite properties, 

which are related to every material type, and to the requirements of the 

application. The mechanical properties of a composite represent a key 

factor for selection. Figure 3 presents composite strength values with 

volume fraction of fibres variation. 

 

 

 Figure 3 - Strength as a function of the volume fraction of fibres. 

(MARTIN, 2006) 

 

In this case, it is indicated which phase is dominant regarding 

mechanical properties of the composite (continuous and dashed lines, 

where the first represents the dominant phase). When the fibres volume 

fraction, Vf, is lower than the critical fibres volume fraction, Vcrit, then 

the composite mechanical properties are matrix dominated, which 

implies a composite with properties similar to the matrix phase. On the 

other hand, in cases of Vf values higher than the Vcrit then the composite 

mechanical properties are fibre dominated, which implies a composite 

with properties similar to the fibre phase. One may observe that although 



15 

values in the lower vicinity of the Vf are indeed fibre dominant, due to 

the volume fraction of the matrix/fibre ratio, the overall composite 

mechanical properties yet present a matrix dominant phase behaviour. 

This observation implies that it is necessary more than a minimum Vf, 

where fibre phase is dominant, so that the mixture cause the composite 

to present a sensitive mechanical strength increasing. Therefore, in order 

to produce fibre-dominant mechanical properties composite, it is 

necessary to produce composites with a minimum volume fraction of 

fibre. This observation infers that fibre dominant mechanical behaviour 

composites are slightly sensitive to matrix mechanical properties 

variations, at least from a mechanical point of view. 

Efforts have been made in order to develop low-cost alternative routes to 

produce CMC’s (LUNDBERG and ECKERBOM, 1995), (JURF and 

BUTNER, 2000), (HASLAM, et al., 2000), (HOLMQUIST, et al., 
2000). Some methods rely on multiple bundle/fabric infiltration which 

results in cost increasing due to the time-consuming process 

(HEGEDUS, 1991), (LANGE, et al., 1995), (JOHNSON, et al., 1998), 

(SHE, et al., 2002)  (SIMON, 2005). Figure 4 presents a schematic CMC 

process where fabric is infiltrated with slurry, and then laid-up, vacuum 

bagged and thermal treated.

2.5.1 Porous materials and porous matrices 

Several sources in literature have related methods to obtain ceramics 

with porosity intentionally developed within the material. These 

materials are also known as ceramic with functional porosity. Those 

materials are used in wide fields of engineering.  

A processing method to produce a carbon-fibre-reinforced silicon 

carbide with low-cost process was reported (MENTZ, et al., 2006). That 

process yields a reaction-bonded silicon carbide matrix and avoids 

reactive damage of the carbon fibres with fibre-dominated behaviour and 

porous matrix. 

Porous structures have been reported for fabricating of matrix 

composites. Weakly bonded particle mixtures of mullite and alumina 

were assessed as candidate matrices for use in porous matrix ceramic 

composites. Conditions for the deflection of a matrix crack at a fibre-

matrix interface were used to identify the combinations of modulus and 

toughness of the fibres and the matrix for which damage-tolerant 

behaviour is expected to occur in the composite. For an aging 

temperature of 1200°C, the critical time exceeds 10000 h for mullite-rich 

mixtures (FUJITA, et al., 2004). This reference reported variation in the 
porosity of pure mullite compacts with aging time (Figure 5). Despite 

the slight change in powder density, the porosity of the compacts 

remains essentially constant over the entire range of aging times, within 

0.2% of its initial value. 

 



17 

 

Figure 5 - (a) Effects of composition and aging time on compact porosity. 

(b) Results in (a), normalized by the initial (green) porosity at the same 

composition (FUJITA, et al., 2004). 

 

Mullite-alumina mixtures exhibit physical and mechanical 

characteristics that make them attractive for use as porous matrices in 

ceramic composites. The key attributes include stable porosity at the 



18 

 

targeted service temperatures of oxide composites, especially for 

alumina concentrations&amp;lt;20%, and combinations of modulus and 

toughness that should lead to deflection of a matrix crack at a fibre-

matrix interface (FUJITA, et al., 2004). 

The composites Nextel fibres 610 and 720 with mullite porous matrix 

have been reported to present favourable mechanical properties both at 

room temperature and after high-temperature long-term aging. In this 

reference, the matrix was produced by colloidal processing (SIMON, 

2005). This route provided a composite that exhibits damage-tolerance 

behaviour with fibres pull-out characteristics (Figure 6a and b). 

Highlighted in Figure 7a) and b) is the microstructure of the composite 

matrix. Nanometric particles of mullite surround micrometric mullite 

powder displaying core-shell structure.

composite tensile test specimens, displaying: (a) uncorrelated fracture of 

fibres within the fibre bundle and (b) fractured fibre after debonding from

powder, and (b) mullite-nanopowder (M-N) mixture displaying composite 

particles with core-shell structure (SIMON, 2005). 

 

More significant enhancements in stability have been achieved through 

the use of mullite as the main matrix constituent and alumina as the 

binder (LEVI, et al., 1998) (CARELLI, et al., 2002). In a common 

implementation, mullite powder is dispersed in aqueous slurry and 

infiltrated into a fibre preform via a vacuum-assisted technique. The two 

processing routes lead to distinctly different matrix topologies, shown 

schematically in Figure 8a. Compositional maps of two prototypical 

systems are presented in Figure 8 (b) (FUJITA, et al., 2005), (ZOK, 

2006).

Figure 8 - Energy-dispersive spectroscopy/transmission electron 

microscope maps of thin foils of (a) 80% mullite/20% alumina (without 

precursor addition) and (b) pure mullite compact impregnated 10 times 

with the concentrated precursor (ZOK, 2006). 

 

The preceding processing routes and the resulting microstructures are 

characterized by three attributes (ZOK, 2006): 

? The mixed mullite/alumina slurry method allows both 
matrix phases to be infiltrated simultaneously. By contrast, 

the precursor route requires additional steps, beyond that of 

slurry infiltration, and is thus more costly.  

? The presence of particulate alumina can compromise the 
stability of the mullite network, especially if its proportion 

exceeds the percolation threshold (FUJITA, et al., 2004). 

Conversely, if the slurry is comprised of only mullite and 

the alumina is introduced subsequently via the precursor 

route, the contiguity of the mullite network is ensured. 

? Because of limitations on the maximum fraction of alumina 
(to inhibit densification), the slurry route results in matrices 

that are relatively weak. Although essential for crack 

deflection, this weakness compromises the off-axis 

properties, especially the resistance to delamination. In 

contrast, the precursor allows filling of the void spaces 



21 

between the particles in the network (at least while the 

pores remain open), resulting in an increase in the 

mechanical integrity of the network. The latter route 

provides access to a broader range of matrix properties. 

Other study related synthesis and characterization of porous 

mullite/alumina mixtures for use as matrices in oxide fibre composites 

(FUJITA, et al., 2005). An assessment was made of the utility of a 
precursor-derived alumina (PDA) for controlling both the modulus and 

the toughness of mullite-rich particle mixtures. In this reference the PDA 

was Al powder slowly digested in a solution of AlCl3.6H2O in deionised 

water at 85°C. Property changes are probed through models of 

mechanical behaviour of bonded particle aggregates. Consideration of 

the conditions for crack deflection at a fibre–matrix interface to ensure 

damage tolerance in a fibre composite was evaluated as well. Figure 9 

presents some Fracture surfaces of three representative porous compacts. 

 



22 

 

 

Figure 9 - Fracture surfaces of three representative porous compacts, all 

with pure mullite particle slurry, but with varying volumes of precursor 

derived alumina: (a, b) 0; (c, d) 8.3%; (e, f) 15.8%, after aging for 2h at 

1200°C (FUJITA, et al., 2005). 

 

The precursor-derived route has the additional advantage over the mixed 

mullite/alumina particle route in that the contiguity of the mullite 

particle network is not compromised. Consequently, the structure is 

relatively immune from densification at the targeted upper use 

temperature for the corresponding fibre composites. Comparisons 

between predicted and measured properties suggest that the precursor-

derived phase exhibits some degree of segregation to the particle 

junctions, yielding larger property elevations relative to that for a 

uniform precursor distribution (FUJITA, et al., 2005). There are several 
commercial available fibres. Fabrics are produced by interweaving fibre 

tows in several satin sizing. Braiding is defined as "the process of 



23 

interlacing three or more threads in such a way that they cross one 

another and are laid in a diagonal formation, flat tubular or solid 

constructions may be formed in this way" (FARNFIELD and ALVEY, 

1975).  

 

2.5.2 Mechanical properties 

Composites are known by their capability of enabling damage tolerance 

at room temperature, along with their ability of bearing load at high 

temperatures. Considering toughening mechanisms, there are a few that 

may be present in composite material, e.g. fibre pull out, fibre bridging, 

crack deflection etc. Figure 10 illustrates those toughening mechanisms. 

 

Figure 10 - Toughening mechanisms in composite materials. 

 

Through bridging toughening mechanisms, fibres hinder crack 

propagation by preventing both upper and lower parts of crack from 

distancing from each other. When the crack extension crosses fibres 

deformation limit, then fibres start to fail. The intact part of the fibre 

starts to pull the failed part out of the matrix, in the fractured zone and 

the attrition between fibre and matrix surface is responsible for some 

energy consumption. An implicit toughening mechanism is present in 
the previously cited cases, which is crack deflection. Once the crack has 

to surround the fibre in order to keep the fibre intact for bearing loads, 

then crack deflection is a prerequisite for bridging and fibre pull out. 

Instead of it, if the crack moves through the fibre, than the composite 



24 

 

mechanical property comes closer to monolithic ceramic material and 

therefore presents no damage tolerance behaviour. In the literature there 

is an approach which gives a criterion for distinguishing whether the 

matrix/fibre combination will result in a penetration or a deflection of a 

moving crack through fibre/matrix interface (HE and HUTCHINSON, 

1989), (HE, et al., 1994). According to that theory, a combination of 
elastic mismatch and interfacial toughness between interface and matrix 

predicts whether the crack moves or not through the fibre (HE and 

HUTCHINSON, 1989). The zones, wherein penetration or deflection 

occurs, are presented in Figure 11. 

 

Figure 11 - He-Hutchinson criteria for crack deflection. (ZOK and LEVI, 

2001). 

 

The information in this graphic infers that a matrix/fibre interface with 

values closer to one, i.e. heavy bonded fibre and matrix, tends to cause 

the crack move through the fibre, which is not an interesting feature. In 

order to enable the deflection feature in a composite two alternatives are 

suggested: either by coating fibres (MORGAN, et al., 1995), 

(BOAKYE, et al., 1999), (KERANS and PARTHASARATHY, 1999), 

(CHAWLA, et al., 2000) (JACKSON, 2006), (JACKSON, 2006) or 
introducing porosity within the matrix (ZOK and LEVI, 2001), 

(MATTONI, et al., 2001), (FUJITA, et al., 2004), (FUJITA, et al., 
2005). 

 



25 

2.5.3 High Temperature Properties of Composites 

The most notable feature contrasting monolithic and composite ceramic 

materials lays on the fact that composite materials can bear similar 

magnitudes of load both at room and at high temperatures and can also 

withstand damage without brittle fracture. In this section, some data 

concerning these composite features are introduced.  

Porous-matrix oxide/oxide CMCs exhibit several behaviour trends that 

are distinctly different from those exhibited by traditional CMCs with a 

fibre–matrix interface. Most SiC-fibre-containing CMCs exhibit longer 

life under static loading and shorter life under cyclic loading. For these 

materials, fatigue is significantly more damaging than creep.  

The high-temperature mechanical behaviour of a porous matrix Nextel 

610/aluminosilicate composite was investigated (LEE, et al., 1998) 

(ZAWADA, et al., 2003). Results revealed low creep resistance limiting 
the use of that CMC to temperatures below 1000°C. Because creep was 

shown to be much more damaging than cyclic loading to oxide–oxide 

CMCs with porous matrix, high temperature creep resistance remains 

among the key issues that must be addressed before using these 

materials in advanced aero space applications (RUGGLES-WRENN, et 
al., 2006), (MEHRMAN, et al., 2007), (RUGGLES-WRENN and 

BRAUN, 2007). 

Ceramic matrix composites, capable of maintaining high strength and 

fracture toughness at high temperatures are prime candidate materials for 

aerospace applications. Additionally, the low density of CMCs and their 

higher service temperatures, together with a reduced need for cooling 

air, contributes for improving high-temperature performance when 

compared to conventional nickel-based superalloys (ZAWADA, et al., 
2003). Concurrent efforts in optimization of CMCs and in design of 

combustion chambers are expected to accelerate the insertion of the 

CMCs into aerospace turbine engine applications, such as combustor 

walls of turbines (PARLIER and RITTI, 2003) (MATTONI, et al., 

2005), (PARTHASARATHY, et al., 2005). Up to date, the majority of 
CMCs development has been driven by the continuous will to improve 

the performance of military and commercial aircrafts (PARLIER and 

RITTI, 2003). CMC are suitable for applications up to 1100°C such as 

flame-holder, exhaust cone and inner flaps for convergent nozzles (see 

Figure 12). 



26 

 

 

Figure 12 - Typical CMC projects on Jet Engines (PARLIER and RITTI, 

2003). 

 

Because these applications require exposure to oxidizing environments, 

the thermodynamic stability and oxidation resistance of CMCs are vital 

issues. The need for environmentally stable composites motivated the 

development of CMCs based on environmentally stable oxide 

constituents (LANGE, et al., 1995)   (MOUCHON and COLOMBAN, 

1995), (TU, et al., 1996), (SZWEDA, et al., 1997).  
From a decade ago, oxide composites have emerged as viable candidates 

for high-temperature thermostructural applications. Their rapid evolution 

is attributable to recent developments in materials and microstructural 

concepts, both for enabling damage tolerance and for ensuring long-term 

morphological stability at the targeted service temperatures. These are 

expected to play a significant role in future material designs and their 

implementation in engineering systems (ZOK, 2006). 

The advantages for the developers are obvious: the low specific weight 

and the high specific strength over a large temperature range. Since the 

start of development, test times of 8900 s (approx. 2,5 h) at wall 

temperatures of up to 2000 K and combustion-chamber pressures of 10-

11 bars were reached within the scope of various test campaigns. 

Advanced reusable space launch vehicles will likely incorporate fibre-



27 

reinforced CMCs in critical propulsion components (SCHMIDT, et al., 

2004). 

The application of two oxide–oxide composites, Nextel 

720/aluminosilicate and Nextel 720/alumina, in the design of a 

combustor was evaluated using a combination of rig testing and 

numerical analysis. The rig tests showed the alumina-matrix composites 

to survive up to ten hours of use, while the alumniosilicate matrix 

composites suffered radial cracks in the ±45° oriented regions (Figure 

13). The use of appropriate fibre architecture to meet the combustion 

design needs is suggested (PARTHASARATHY, et al., 2005)

cracks; (b) aluminosilicate matrix composites exhibiting cracks at the same 

location. (c) combustor under conditions for soot formation, . (d) maximum 

temperature reached to be around 1200°C.(PARTHASARATHY, et al.,

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The experimental procedure of this work can be summarized as: 

? Slurry preparation and characterization;  

? Composite panel production;  

? Thermal treatment development;  

? Physical and mechanical properties characterization of both the 
composite panel and the matrix material; 

? Oxidation kinetics determination. 
 

3.1 MATERIALS 

For the RBMAO process development the used raw materials were 

aluminium powder (Eckart-Werke, Ecka AS 081 –&amp;lt;45 µm), mullite 

powder (Treibacher, WFM 0.08 – 80 µm) and phenolic resin powder 

(novolac, Hexion corp., PF 0227 SP 01). For adjusting the slurry 

viscosity, a phosphate ester (PE) dispersant (Zschimmer &amp;amp; Schwarz, 

Dolacol D1001) was used. In order to produce composites from 

RBMAO matrix, a reinforcement was added (Nextel 720 ™ woven 

fibre, 3M) into eight-harness satin woven fabrics. For the oxidation 

kinetics experiment commercial aluminium carbide (99% Al4C3, Sigma 

Aldrich, USA, 325#mesh) was used. 

 

3.2 POWDER PREPARATION 

The slurry for infiltrating the fibre fabric woven was prepared by 

combining the ceramic powder, i.e. mullite, and the metallic powder, i.e. 

aluminium, and milling the mixture using an attritor mill (NFT PE 075), 

balls and jar of Zirconia and using acetone as milling media without 

atmosphere controlling. For each mill batch the mixture consisted of 

88.6 g of mullite and 11.4 g of aluminium powder. In order to evaluate 

relationship of particle size and milling time a standard mixture was 

loaded into the mill jar and samples of the slurry were taken out in 

intervals of every hour. The particle size distributions of these samples 

were measured (Mastersizer, Malvern MS5). The measuring procedure 

consisted of braking agglomeration by dipping an ultrasonic probe into 

the collected sample for 1 min and proceeding the measuring right 

afterwards.  

 



29 

3.3 VISCOSITY DETERMINATION OF THE SLURRY 

The viscosity determination of the slurry to be used in the fibre fabric 

woven infiltration was split in three steps:  optimising dispersant amount 

(in the range from 0.6 to 2.0% of solid content, according to the 

supplier); finding the maximum slurry solid content; and measuring the 

effect of the phenolic resin addition. Moreover, before any viscosity 

measurement, the slurry was dispersed by dipping an ultrasonic probe 

into the slurry container for 1 min. A cup/rotor set was used in the 

viscometer (MV1, Haake RV 20). The shearing stresses measured were 

in the range from 1 to 400 s
-1

, with a dwelling time of 1 min and then 

returning to 1 s
-1

 according to Figure 14: 

 

 

 

Figure 14 - Viscosity measurement set points 

 

A calibration test was done previously to the viscosity measurements. It 

consisted of measuring the viscosity of a standard fluid (Brookfield 

standard fluid with nominally 50 mPa.s) within the rate variation range. 

The first step consisted in preparing samples with 40 ml slurry (45 wt.%) 

in different containers and varying the dispersant amount for each one, 

which will be tagged as PE%.  

The second step consisted in preparing samples with 40 ml slurry (with 

the PE% optmised) in different containers with stoichiometric amount of

phenolic resin in relation to the aluminium content and varying the

The third step consisted of prepare samples with 40ml of slurry (with the 

better PE%) in different containers with stoichiometric amount of carbon 

graphite in relation to the aluminium content and varying the particle 

volume fraction for each one. 

 

3.4 THERMAL TREATMENT CYCLE DETERMINATION 

In order to determine the set points of the thermal treatment to which the 

composite panel would be submitted, a characterization of the raw 

material mixture of the matrix was carried out. The whole thermal 

treatment process consisted of two programmed steps, one in inert 

atmosphere and the other in oxidizing atmosphere. The purpose of the 

first thermal treatment is to form the intermediate carbide phase, which 

is a product from the reaction of the pyrolysed carbon with the 

aluminium powder. The second thermal treatment is to oxidize the 

previously formed carbide phase and to convert it in to an oxide ceramic. 

Therefore to characterize the thermal treatment cycles some differential 

thermal (DTA) and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses (Netzsch DTA/TG 

STA 409) were performed. Phase analyses (Bruker AXS D8 Discovery) 

were based in powder X-Ray diffraction. The XRD was set to a step of 

0.02° and reading time of 2 s using k? (? = 1,5418 Å). 

Those characterization techniques may be divided in three parts: 

? reaction thermal treatment;  

? oxidation thermal treatment and;  

? TG of mixtures in excess and in stoichiometrical additions, in 
relation to the carbon and aluminium content. 

For the reaction thermal treatment characterization, three different 

analyses were performed. Firstly, a sample of the phenolic resin 

underwent an inert atmosphere DTA/TG analysis with heating rate of 

10°C/min until 1450°C. Subsequently, a sample of the dried slurry 

powder containing mullite, aluminium and resin underwent an inert 

atmosphere DTA/TG analysis with same heating cycle of the first 

DTA/TG test. Then, the present phases of a powder sample, which were 

submitted to the first thermal treatment, were detected by means of XRD 

analysis.  

For the oxidation thermal treatment characterization, three different 

analyses were done. Firstly, a sample containing mullite and aluminium 

powder underwent an oxidizing atmosphere DTA/TG analysis with 

heating rate of 10°C/min until 1450°C. Afterwards a sample of the 



31 

mullite and aluminium powder and phenolic resin underwent a DTA/TG 

analysis at the same heating cycle. Then, the present phases of powder 

sample, which were submitted to the second and final thermal treatment, 

were determined by XRD.  

Additionally, two samples of mullite and aluminium powder were 

analysed by DTA/TG. The difference between samples was the amount 

of resin: the first one had a stoichiometric ratio and the second one had 

50%mol more than the stoichiometric ratio. 

The stoichiometric ratio was determined according to equation 4: 

                                    

                        
4 

 

Considering that the mixture was prepared with 88.6 g mullite and 11.4 

g aluminium, the stoichiometric value was 6.9 g and the value in excess 

was 9.9 g, respectively for the phenolic resin. The latest value 

corresponds to the suggested set point for the oxidation thermal 

treatment. 

 

3.5 FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION  

In order to produce the composite panel according to the developed 

matrix route suggested in this work, the fibre fabric woven had to be 

prepared, since it is provided with a sizing from the supplier. Before the 

infiltration process, therefore, a desizing thermal treatment was 

performed, following the procedure established by the supplier (3M); 

heating rate of 7°C/min until 700°C with dwell of 30 min for small 

samples and 2 h for large samples. 

The tools required for the infiltrations process are presented in Figure 

15. 



32 

 

 

Figure 15 - Set-up of infiltration process. 

 

The milled powder containing 88.4g mullite, 11.6 g aluminium and 6.9 g 

of phenolic resin was mixed with ethanol to produce a slurry for 

infiltrating the fabric woven of 720 Nextel fibres. In this slurry 0.6 wt.% 

phosphate ester dispersant was also added. The slurry was mixed for 30 

min in a magnetic stirrer. The slurry was then poured into a container 

with a wired support, which holds the fabrics and helps the extraction of 

the fibre fabrics out of slurry container. Finally, fibres were dipped into 

the slurry, and the infiltration process was assisted by an ultrasonic bath 

(Figure 16).

In Figure 16 (c and d), the green cover placed over the container with 

slurry is wetted with ethanol in order to cause the slurry not to dry along 

the infiltration process. After 10 min infiltration process, the fibres were 

taken out of the slurry and placed onto the support tray in order to cast 

off the excess slurry, by pressing the whole set with trays and fibre 

fabric woven with pressure of 0.7 MPa for 30 s. After this time, nuts 

were then finger tightened in order to keep the fibres together; and only 

later on the pressure was released.  

A cylinder was placed over the tray to better distribute the pressure onto 

the tray and therefore to compact fibres with homogeneity. Then, in 

order to dry the infiltrated fibre fabric, the tray set was placed in a 

vacuum chamber for 24h. 

 

3.6 POROSITY  

For the porosity measurement two types of samples were considered:  

? Dried slurry; and  

? Compacted monolithic bars (as used for the mechanical test).  
In the first case, samples were prepared by drying the slurry so that only 

the respective solid contents, 50  and 60 wt.% were evaluated. Due to the 

a) b) 

c) d) 



34 

 

irregular dimensions, those samples were measured by Archimedes’ 

principle. 

In the case of  pressed samples, the density  was first geometrically 

determined and converted to porosity.  

In both cases, the experimental plan was designed in two levels. Firstly, 

the composition varied:, just mullite and aluminium powder with the 

same content of the slurry for infiltration with exception of resin content. 

With these samples the pressure for compaction was varied in two 

points, i.e. 50 and 200 MPa.  

In the second case, the samples had the same composition of the slurry 

for infiltration, and compaction pressure was 50 MPa. Moreover, the 

powder for the pressed samples was prepared by drying a slurry batch 

with composition of 88.4 g mullite and 11.6 g aluminium powder, with 

addition of 6.9 g phenolic resin, and sieved in 200 #mesh. All samples 

were weighted (2 g) prior to feeding the compaction mould. Those 

samples are described in Table 1: 

 
Table 1 - Experimental plan for porosity measurement.

For measuring the samples weight a balance with a 0.001 g resolution 

was used (R200D, Sartorius). The theoretical density was obtained by 

calculating the density of a solid with 80 wt.% mullite and 20 wt.% 

alumina using the rule of mixture, considering  the theoretical density of 

each component. 

 

3.7 LINEAR SHRINKAGE  

For the linear shrinkage determination, the same features applied in 

geometrical porosity measurement were used, i.e. monolithic bars with 

and without resin and pressed either with 50 MPa or 200MPa. The initial 

dimensions of the samples are presented in the Table 2. 

 

 

 

 
 



35 

Table 2 - Experimental plan for linear shrinkage measurement. 

Samples Dimensions (LxWxH) [mm] 

Without Resin 50 MPa (WOR50)  47.2x6.7x4.6 

Without Resin 200 MPa (WOR200) 42.2x6.7x3.8 

With Resin 50 MPa (WR50) 47.2x6.7x4.4 

 

The largest dimension (length) was considered to determine the linear 

shrinkage. Then 30 samples of each group were prepared and underwent 

a two-stage thermal treatment. The length of the samples was measured 

after oxidation for both groups and after every thermal treatment for the 

group with resin.  

 

3.8 DENSITY  

For density determination the samples had the same configuration used 

for the linear shrinkage. Nevertheless, only 10 samples were considered 

for measuring density, which was performed geometrically. 

 

3.9 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF MATRIX AND COMPOSITE 

For the mechanical test of the matrix material bars with same 

characteristics used for linear shrinkage determination, were applied. In 

this case, 30 bars were considered. The mechanical tests were done 

according to the ASTM C1161 – 02c and 1341 - 00 standards (ASTM - 

C 1341 - 00, 2003)(ASTM - C 1161 - 02C, 2003).  Considering the 

samples dimensions, the used rate in the test was 2mm/min. For 

measuring the flexural load, a universal testing machine (ATS, model 

27-z-0007-D96) was used (see Figure 17). 



36 

 

 

Figure 17 - Apparatus for measuring the flexural strength. 

 

A four-point flexural mechanical testing set was applied, with a span of 

20 mm and a bearing roller with 4 mm diameter. The bearing roller was 

fixed with the help of magnets to ensure a degree of freedom for the 

tested samples during test. In Figure 17 the magnets are the squared 

plates right on side of the bearing roller, in accordance with ASTM 

C1161 – 02c and 1341 - 00. A Weibull approach was fitted to the 

strength results in order to determine the mechanical properties of each 

group. 

Additionally, the mechanical behaviour of a composite panel produced 

from 720™ Nextel fibre fabric woven was evaluated using the same 

testing set, with dimensions according to ASTM C1161 and 1341. The 

panel configuration corresponded to eight infiltrated layers of fibre 

fabrics with 45x6x3mm (LxWxH, respectively). 

 

3.10 MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSES 

The microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM, Philips XL 30, FEI CO.; JEOL JSM-6390LV), field emission gun 

scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Leo Gemini 1530) and optical 

microscopy (OM, Aristomet) with a CCD camera.  



37 

First characterizations were carried out for samples taken out of the 

composite panel with the aim of evaluating the flaw density after 

thermal treatment cycles. Those images were also considered for 

evaluation of fibre surface quality after thermal treatment. Additionally, 

three groups of matrix samples were considered. Those samples were 

analogue to those used in the linear shrinkage with some additional 

compaction pressure values, i.e. without resin, pressed at 25, 50, 75 100 

and 200 MPa and with resin, at 50 MPa. The microstructure of the 

composite panel was also evaluated in SEM and OM. SEM images in SE 

(secondary electron detection) were considered under several 

magnifications. 

 

3.11 OXIDATION KINETICS 

The oxidation kinetics was evaluated in order to determine the activation 

energy for the oxidation of aluminium carbide. In this context, two 

experiments were suggested. The first one is related to the oxidation 

kinetic of the aluminium carbide with a mixture of 50 wt.% mullite and 

aluminium powder with the stoichiometric amount of resin to provide 

carbon for the carbide formation. This mixture underwent the reaction 

thermal treatment proposed in this work without the oxidation thermal 

treatment to produce a mixture with non-oxidized carbide. This powder 

mixture was then submitted to a TG analysis in isothermal dwells at 

600°C to 1200°C, with a heating time schedule of 1h up to the dwelling 

temperature.  

The second experiment was the determination of the apparent activation 

energy of oxidation process of a commercially available aluminium 

carbide powder (Aluminium Carbide 99%, Sigma Aldrich, 325#mesh). 

In this context, the commercial powder underwent the same test 

configuration of the first experiment.  

Prior to these evaluations, two different samples were submitted to a 

DTA/TG analysis in order to qualitatively evaluate the oxidation 

kinetics. The difference between those samples was the presence of 

carbide phase. They consisted of 50/50% mullite/aluminium; in the case 

of carbide phase then phenolic resin was added to the mixture and it 

underwent the reaction thermal treatment. Therefore, this experiment 

was planned to evaluate the oxidation kinetics of aluminium and 

aluminium carbide powder in a qualitative way.

4 RESULTS  

The presentation of results was organized according to fabrication 

process steps, i.e., powder preparation, panel production, thermal 

treatment and characterization. All results are first presented and then 

discussed at the end of the section. 

 

4.1 POWDER PREPARATION  

Figure 18 presents the evolution of the particle size as the milling time 

increases. 

 

Figure 18 - Evolution of the mean particle size according to milling time. 

 

The presented curves show different particle sizes. According to the 

literature for reaction bonding processes, mean particle sizes, i.e. d50, 

lower than 2 ?m are acceptable for producing final parts without flaws 

arising from the thermal treatment. The milling time from the mixture 

used in this work was, therefore, fixed in 7 h.

Figure 19 - Slurry viscosity as a function of the dispersant amount. 

 

The viscosity presents a minimum value at 0.6 wt.% dispersant with 

regard to the solid weight percentage. This was the set value in order to 

perform further characterization of the slurry. Moreover, the viscosity 

and shearing stress of the slurry containing 0.6% as a function of the 

shear rate is presented in Figure 20.

Figure 20 - Shearing stress and viscosity of a slurry with 0.6 PE% 

 

Although the slurry viscosity presented a slightly rheopexic behaviour 

(area of 72.1 Pa.s
-1

), it showed a quasi Newtonian fluid behaviour (blue 

curve in Figure 20). The rheopexic behaviour found may be associated 

with the time it dwelled at 500s
-1

, which may have caused the slurry to 

dry, since ethanol was the solvent. The slurry viscosity presented values 

of 6.31± 0.77 mPa.s which can be verified in the black curve of Figure 

20.  

The second step of characterization was the slurry viscosity variation 

with regard to the solid content (Figure 21). Table 3 presents log values

is more related to fibre-shaped particles. Spherical particles tend to 

present intrinsic viscosity values of about 2.5 Pa.s. Additionally, the 

slurry with the highest solid content presented shear thinning behaviour.  

The second step of characterization was the slurry viscosity as a function 

of solid content with addition of carbon powder (Figure 22). Table 4 

presents log values of the non-linear curve fitting.

According to Figure 22 and, the maximum volume fraction of particles, 

which can be achieved with this slurry, is approximately 50%. This is a 

reasonable value when compared to literature values for similar 

suspensions of ceramic particles with similar shapes (RAHAMAN, 

2003). The intrinsic viscosity found was 2.8 Pa.s, which is also related to 

spherical particles (RAHAMAN, 2003).  

Concerning the results in this section, the set points for producing a 

stable suspension of the raw material mixture with addition of phenolic 

resin in ethanol were: 

? 0.6 wt.% phosphate ester dispersant; 

? 45 wt.% solid content slurry. 
Some slurries were then produced, in which fibre fabric woven were 

infiltrated and composite panel were produced. To produce composite 

panels using phenolic resin for both prepreg consolidation and for 

carbon source to the carbide reaction, this resin was applied to the 

slurries. Although the slurry exhibited enough stability for going through 

the infiltration process without any phase segregation or precipitation, 

the slurry presented neither high solid content nor low viscosity. Those 

properties are required for a desirable fibre fabric woven infiltration and 

composite panel production, which means composites with desired 

mechanical strength. Lower viscosity, i.e. 50mPa.s, and higher solid 

content, i.e. approximately 45 vol. %, or ~80 wt.%, are desirable slurry 

properties for fibre fabric woven infiltration (MACHRY, 

2010),(WAMSER, 2010).  

In order to evaluate the slurry properties with the phenolic resin 

replacement, an evaluation of the slurry viscosity with graphite powder 

was carried out. According to the results of Figure 22, which are 

summarized in Table 4, the application of graphite as an alternative 

source for carbon to be used in the carbide reaction is a promising way 

for lowering the slurry viscosity. Detrimentally, the composite route 

production might lose the potential for producing prepregs with enough 

green handling strength, once the phenolic resin is not only the carbon 

source, but also it consolidates the infiltrated fabric woven by solvent 

drying. Nonetheless, small additions of phenolic resin for this purpose 

may not harm the low viscosity of the slurry, which was achieved with 

the application of the graphite powder. Consequently, a combination of 
graphite powder with small contents of phenolic resin is suggested. 

Therefore, a mixture combining 3 g graphite powder and 0.7 g phenolic 

resin might be used in order to produce a slurry, which not only presents 

low viscosity, but can also consolidates the fibre fabrics into prepregs.

4.3 THERMAL TREATMENT  

Figure 23 presents DTA/TG analyses of phenolic resin in an inert 

atmosphere (Argon). 

  

Figure 23 - DTA/TG analysis of phenolic resin in an inert atmosphere. 

 

Novolac-Type phenolic resins are normally used in applications which 

require high amounts of residual carbon after pyrolysis. The 1
st
 

derivative curve of the TG analysis shows a sharp peak at a ~500°C and 

a smaller peak at ~400°C. This sample presented a residual carbon 

amount of 55% (last point of TG blue curve). The first dwell 

temperature was considered as 400°C, followed by another dwell 

temperature at 500°C. 

Figure 24 presents DTA/TG analyses of raw materials mixture in an

The 1
st
 derivative curve of TG analysis shows a peak in the same 

temperature range of that presented in Figure 23, although in a smaller 

intensity. It is associated with the available pyrolysing material which is 

losing mass. The reason behind this analysis was to evaluate whether the 

resin with the mixture of raw material would behave the same way it did 

non-combined . This hypothesis was confirmed by the presence of the 

peak in the same temperature range. Moreover, in this TG curve, no 

weight change regarding to oxidation of the metallic aluminium powder 

was observed due to the non-oxidizing atmosphere.

Figure 27 - DTA/TG analysis of raw materials mixture without resin in 

oxidizing atmosphere. 

Two different behaviours may be detected in comparison to those in the 

inert atmosphere (DTA/TG), which is the weight gain, with starting 

temperature in the range of 600°C and a very well defined exothermal 

peak associated to this weight gain. Considering the sample 

composition, those two features are associated to the oxidation of the 

metallic aluminium powder, since in this analysis, there was neither the 

reaction thermal treatment nor the resin content in the mixture, and 

therefore no carbide reaction could have taken place. Therefore, the 

single available component for oxidation reaction was the aluminium 

powder. Moreover, the presented curves are consistent with the available 

RBAO literature data: not only the extremely defined peak in the DTA 

curve at 600°C, but also the weight gain in two steps depicted in the TG 

curve. 

The DTA/TG of raw material mixture with resin result is then presented 

in Figure 28.

Figure 29 - XRD analysis of raw materials mixture after oxidation- and 

reaction thermal treatment and as prepared samples. 

 

In the pattern curve of the mixed raw material (MRM), i.e. the bottom 

part of graph, the present phases are only mullite and aluminium, 

indicated as M and Al, respectively. This sample after undergoing the 

reaction thermal treatment yielded a product, from which the pattern 

curve of reacted material was carried out. In this pattern curve, alumina 

and aluminium carbide phases are present, both indicated as A and AlC, 

respectively. The alumina phase can be justified due to the premature 

oxidation of the metallic aluminium powder, once the MRM contained 

an oxide ceramic component, which is able to supply oxygen for the 

oxidation reaction even though the furnace atmosphere where the 

reaction took place was inert. The top curve presents a XRD pattern of 

sample after all thermal treatments. The present phases are only mullite 

and alumina.

Figure 30 - DTA/TG analysis of sample without reaction thermal treatment 

of raw materials mixture with resin, with stoichiometric- and 50% excess

Those two samples were prepared with the mixture of the ceramic raw 

material and the addition of phenolic resin both in stoichiometric and in 

50% excess amount without reaction thermal treatment. 

Both TG and DTA curve results present an analogous behaviour, 

wherein weight loss takes first place from 400 to 550°C and afterwards 

weight gain takes place at &gt; 900°C, achieving quasi stable weight value 

for &gt;1050°C. Although the sample with 50% excess achieved a lower 

final mass amount, the weight gain profile is similar to the other sample.

Figure 31 - Oxidation thermal treatment set points suggested in this work. 

 

In this figure dwelling temperatures are 500°C, 975°C and 1200°C, for 

the carbon oxidation, first carbide oxidation and final carbide oxidation, 

respectively. Laboratory air provided the oxidising atmosphere 

characteristic. 

Regarding the presented results of this section, the set points for the 

thermal treatment are presented in Figure 26 and Figure 31. Rates of 1.5 

and 2.5°C/min, the heating rate until the first and second dwell time, 

respectively, were selected in order to prevent excessive degassing 

formation, so that the material presents neither collapse nor crack 

formation and therefore enabling the formation of low flaw density, 

which is a prerequisite for the suggested novel route production. 

Considering the reaction thermal treatment set points, the first dwelling 

temperature was selected in order to give time for gases, which originate 

from phenolic resin pyrolysis, to flow out from the internal 

microstructure without causing flaws to the sample. The second dwelling 

temperature was selected in order to give time so the carbide reaction 

can occur. According to Wang and co-workers the maximum DSC peak 

of aluminium carbide occurs at 975°C; therefore, it was the second fixed 

dwelling temperature (WANG, et al., 2004). The last dwelling 

temperature was constrained from the maximum temperature, wherein

the fibres have its internal microstructures modified, i.e. grain-growth or 

phase segregation (GOUSHEGIR, et al., 2012).  

Considering the oxidation thermal treatment set points, the first dwelling 

temperature was selected in order to give time for gases resulted from 

carbon pyrolysis, to flow out from the internal microstructure without 

causing internal flaws. The second dwelling temperature was selected in 

order to give time for the carbide oxidation to occur. In Figure 57, the 

DTA curve of mullite Al4C3, i.e., black curve with open square symbol, 

a wide peak, which has a maximum at ~950°C, is associated to the 

aluminium carbide oxidation. The second dwelling point was therefore 

fixed, for convenience, at the second dwelling temperature of the 

reaction thermal treatment, i.e., 975°C. The last dwelling temperature is 

1200°C and it is constrained from the maximum temperature. 

In Figure 29, the top curve presents the XRD pattern of a sample after all 

thermal treatments. The present phases are only mullite and alumina, 

what confirms that is possible to achieve a final mixture of phases 

consisting of mullite and alumina, with an intermediate carbide phase.  

 

4.4 FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION  

For producing composite panel slurries with resin, mullite and 45 wt.% 

aluminium powder were used for infiltrating the fabric woven with 

precursors of the matrix material. The infiltration process can be 

illustrated in the flowchart presented in Figure 32 



54 

 

 

Figure 32 - Flowchart of infiltration - and thermal treatment processes. 

After infiltrating fibre fabric woven with slurry and pilling them up in 

stacks, the prepreg panel was produced, presenting a greyish colour due 

to the amount of aluminium powder within the mixture. An example of 

prepreg panel is shown in Figure 33.

The sample is just dried and, due to the resin content, it presents strength 

enough for dry cutting in the required dimensions. Afterwards, the 

prepreg underwent the two-stage thermal treatment (Figure 26 and 

Figure 31). Right after this treatment, the sample presented dark colour, 

associated to the pyrolysed resin. In this thermal treatment, inert 

atmosphere was assured by pressurizing Argon at 1 bar inside the 

furnace tube. If any connection of the gas tubes or even the tube tap 

would have presented any leakage, then any oxygen/oxidant gas from 

outside would not be able to enter within the tube due to its internal 

higher pressure. After the reaction thermal treatment, then the reacted 

composite panel underwent the oxidation thermal cycles in a muffle 

furnace. In this process, oxidizing atmosphere ensured the oxidation 

reaction of the newly formed intermediate carbide phase in order to 

produce the final ceramic oxide phase, i.e. alumina. Inside the muffle, 

the samples were carefully placed over ceramic foams to ensure a 

flowing path for the oxygen required in the oxidation reaction. Ceramic 

bricks were also used to place samples in a region of the muffle with 

more homogenous temperature distribution and higher access for the 

oxygen to reach the sample.  
After finishing this last thermal treatment, the sample presented a 

whitish colour (Figure 34) due to the content of oxide ceramic, i.e. 

mullite and alumina.

4.5 POROSITY 

The results of the two experiment methods for porosity determination 

are presented in Table 5. 

 
Table 5 - Matrix porosity values. 

Samples Porosity [%]

- - 53.4±0.4 

With Resin 50 MPa

52.8±0.4 54.0±0.7 50.9±1 

 
The values of  porosities obtained from Archimedes’ principle, i.e., dried 

50% and 60%, are very similar. Pressed samples, i.e., WOR200 and 50 

and WR50, presented porosity more consistent with the compaction 

pressure. The sample with compaction pressure of 200 MPa presented 

lower porosity than samples compacted at 50MPa. This is expected, but 

             10mm 



57 

when samples pressed with 50 MPa are compared, then samples which 

have resin addition in their composition presented lower porosity values. 

In this case, resin also acts as a lubricant and provides better compaction 

of raw materials. Nevertheless, the difference between the porosities is 

within the range of the  standard deviation. Other important 

characteristic is the stable porosity value along the thermal treatment 

cycle. It started with 53%, changed to 54% and finished with 51%, 

which gives a final change of approximately two percentage points.

4.8 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF MATRIX AND COMPOSITE  

Mechanical properties are presented in this section. The first 

characterization was carried out with square cross section bars of the 

matrix material after it underwent the two-stage thermal treatment and 

the polishing process. In order to evaluate the effect of the compacting 

pressure on mechanical properties of the matrix, Weibull analysis was 

undertaken on the results from the four-point bending test. Figure 35 

presents the Weibull analysis of the mechanical test carried out with bars 

of WOR50 and WOR200 and WR50. This figure presents values of 

                                in abscissa axis and natural 
logarithm of ultimate flexural stress values in ordinate axis.

In Figure 35 all set of results present similar values of curve slope, i.e. 

Weibull parameter m, which was ~10.5. Samples without resin presented 

the higher and the lower set of mechanical strength, and the samples 

with resin presented higher values than the WOR50 samples, which 

were compacted at the same pressure, i.e., 50MPa, and lower values than 

WOR200, pressed at higher pressure, i.e., 200MPa. Table 8 presents a 

summary of the mechanical properties of the tested samples.

Deformations of ~2% without brittle fracture behaviour may be observed 

along with the capability of bearing loads after ultimate flexural stress, 

a.k.a. damage tolerance. Although this data corresponded to a damage 

tolerant behaviour, the ultimate flexural strength is lower than the 

expected, ~200 MPa(RUGGLES-WRENN, et al., 2006)(RUGGLES-

WRENN, et al., 2008), which implies that more development in the 
infiltration process in order to get better composites is yet demanded. 

According to the Weibull fitting, which is presented in Figure 35, the 

samples without resin pressed at 200 MPa presented higher ?0 than the 

samples with resin pressed at 50 MPa, which showed in turn higher ?0 

than the samples without resin pressed at 50MPa. This may be 

associated to the presence of sintering characteristics in samples WR50 

in comparison to the samples WOR50 (cf. Figures of WR50 samples, i.e. 

Figure 38 a) and b), with Figures of WOR50 samples, i.e. Figure 42a) 

and b); Figure 41 and Figure 47). 

Although WR and WOR samples presented dissimilar ?0, they showed 

Weibull parameters m with similar values. In this case, WOR, which 

represents RBAO, and WR, which represents RBMAO, are indeed

production routes with comparable reliability and since RBAO is a

classification. 

 

4.9 MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSES  

The images presented in Figure 37; Figure 38;Figure 39; and Figure 40 

were collected in FE-SEM with 50.000X and 100.000X magnification of 

samples produced without resin by compacting them with pressures 

corresponding to 25, 50, 75 and 100 MPa.

In all those images the brighter region represents ceramic particles with 

submicrometric size. Samples pressed at 25 MPa (Figure 37) present 

grains that still show features of the particles, which gave form to them, 

even after they underwent the thermal treatment at 1200°C. This 

behaviour is less evident as the compaction pressure rises, as expected.

65 

Samples pressed at 100 MPa presented denser microstructures than 25 

MPa samples and the sintering features are more evident as well. 

Samples compacted at 50 MPa slightly differ from 25 MPa samples. In 

turn, 75 MPa samples present the same feature in comparison with 100 

MPa samples. On the other hand, in a comparison to 75 and 25 MPa 

samples, the 75 MPa samples showed denser microstructure with grains 

more evident. The densest samples were those compacted at 100 MPa.  

In Figure 41 to Figure 43, SEM images, the samples were the same used 

in mechanical test, i.e., WR50 and WOR50 and 200. The image analysis 

was performed in fractured surfaces and polished surfaces.

In both WR samples, it is possible to observe grain formation from 

sintering. This feature is verified by the rounded edges of the grains and 

the formation of continuity through the grains (top of Figure 41 a)). In 

those figures, the gray region represents ceramic grains, which were 

formed after the two-stage thermal treatment.

These two previous figures are images of panel cross section and fibres

phase. The lower density of flaw, which is not normally present in those 

kind of composite materials (YANG, et al., 2009). Low flaw density 

enhances composite properties, e.g. permeability, electrical and thermal 

properties, by producing a composite with more homogeneous matrix 

morphology. Although those properties are increased due to the matrix 

homogeneity, the ultimate tensile strength is not sensibly modified, 

which is expected once the composite is fibre-phase dominant, from a 

"mechanical property" point of view. Low flaw density is also present in 

the image collected from a similar sample in a conventional optical 

microscope (Figure 46).

In Figure 48, the fibre surface quality is not affected after the suggested 

thermal treatment. Although the thermal treatment involves two kinds of 

reaction, i.e. carbide formation and oxidation reaction, the process does 

not affect the fibres and therefore it does not harm their properties. 

Moreover, a recent work pointed out a maximum temperature, i.e. 

1300°C, wherein fibre grains do not coalesce (GOUSHEGIR, et al., 
2012). A batch consisting of the same raw material mixture but with 

different particle sizes was prepared so that the phase could be visually 

identified due to the bigger mullite particle size and smaller alumina 

newly formed phase. The samples of this batch are presented in Figure 

49. 

 

Figure 49 - Samples visual aspect: (a) as processed (b) reacted in inert 

atmosphere at 1200°C (c) oxidized at 1200°C. 

 

The green body presented gray coloration due to the amount of 

aluminium powder added as raw material (Figure 49a). The strength of 

green body was high enough to allow handling and cutting. The dark 

aspect of the reacted samples (Figure 49b) refers to the carbon originated 

during the carbonization step. The oxidized sample presented an external 

region where oxidation took place while the inner region preserved the 

reacted composition (i.e. aluminium carbide). It remained unreacted due 

to the small dwell period (Figure 49c). In images of Figure 50 to Figure 

54, which were collected in SEM (Jeol), are the same samples of the side 

group batch.

SEM micrographs of green body exhibited microstructures, where 

mullite particles are surrounded by small particles associated to 

aluminium and resin particles (see Figure 50a and b). Pressing process 

resulted in a microstructure where aluminium particles and resin 

particles are yet present. The higher magnified images of Figure 50a and

actually expected to happen in order to provide a fine alumina layer 

surrounding the surface of mullite particles (Figure 51a and b). The 

reacted region is represented in the Figure 49b by the dark coloured 

region. After oxidation thermal treatment, the oxidized region presented 

a microstructure where coarse mullite particles are homogeneously 

distributed in microstructure surrounded by a finer particulate (Figure 

52a and b). The interface between reacted/oxidized phases was displayed 

in a single image to evaluate the microstructure differences. It can 

clearly be seen that in the oxidized region finer particles are present (see 

Figure 53). The particles of the reacted region without carbon content, 

i.e. yellow brown in Figure 49, are coarser but exhibit a different 

microstructure from the green body (see Figure 54a and b). The reacted 

region is represented in the Figure 49b by the yellow brown coloured 

region.  

In images in Figure 55 and Figure 56, which were collected in FE-SEM 

(Leo), are the same samples of the side group batch which differ by the 

image detection type used, wherein Figure 55a is SE; Figure 55b is 

inless and Figure 55c is BSE and Figure 56 is in SE. The last image is 

for highlighting the morphology of the newly formed phase, which is the 

very fine dispersed phase.

In Figure 55 the several applied detection method present data related to 

composition, (a), topography (c), and mixed information (b). In Figure 

55, the sample was embedded with epoxy resin in vacuum so that the 

void parts can be identified as the darker regions, which represents the 

porosity of the part, and brighter regions can be associated with the 

ceramic material. Mass contrast information is useful in order to observe 

that the inner particle composition is different from the outer shell layer. 

In this context, one can associate this different composition with the 

formation of an outer shell of alumina, although it was not evaluated in 

this study. Topography information image exhibits the epoxy resin 

filling in the void regions. From topography information image, the 

microstructure of mullite particles surrounded by fine dispersed alumina 

is also highlighted in Figure 56.

alumina phase. 

 

This microstructure present similarity with the optimal morphology 

pointed out in literature by (ZOK, 2006) and is also present in the Figure 

8.

4.10 OXIDATION KINETICS 

The first evaluation, in order to qualitatively evaluate oxidation kinetics 

of the aluminium carbide, was carried out with a DTA/TG of two 

different samples. The first type of sample consisted of a mixture of 

mullite and aluminium and the second type of sample consisted of a 

mixture of mullite and aluminium carbide, the one produced from the 

two-stage thermal treatment suggested in this work. Figure 57 presents 

DTA/TG analyses of aluminium and aluminium carbide samples for 

evaluation in oxidizing atmosphere. 

 

Figure 57 - DTA/TG analysis of RBMAO precursor mixture with samples 

reacted and not reacted. 

 

Curves of both samples have dissimilar behaviour both for TG and DTA 

evaluation. In TG resulted curve for sample which contains aluminium 

carbide, it presents a single region of weight gain, which takes place in 

the range from approximately 650°C to 950°C with subsequent weight 

loss, resulted from oxidation of some residual carbon which was not 

completely reacted with the aluminium powder. In TG resulted curve for 

sample which contains aluminium powder, it presents the already 

presented oxidation behaviour of this type of material. In DTA resulted 

curve for sample which contains aluminium carbide, it presents a wide 

exothermal peak in temperature range from approximately 600°C to 

1200°C. These peaks, i.e. peaks of oxidation of aluminium carbide,

contrast with the peaks presented in the oxidation of the aluminium 

powder, were only a very narrow peak at 570°C and a wider peak in 

870°C were present. Therefore, in qualitative terms it is possible to state 

that aluminium and aluminium carbide powder possess dissimilar 

oxidation behaviour. In order to get more quantitative terms information 

of this difference, then mass gain evaluations experiments of those two 

materials were carried out. 

An overlap of Figure 23 and Figure 27 results in Figure 30 and 

comparing the latest with the curve of the samples consisting of mullite 

and carbide, i.e. Figure 57, it is evident that those samples are dissimilar 

regarding their TG profile behaviour. Since the TG profile behaviour of 

Figure 57 is associated with the carbide oxidation TG profile, then it 

might be concluded that without the reaction thermal treatment it is not 

possible to produce the intermediate carbide phase. It is worthy 

reminding that Figure 30 is an evaluation wherein samples consisted of 

mullite, aluminium powder and resin. A result of this observation 

implies that if the simple heating of the raw material might produce the 

intermediate carbide phase, then in this evaluation, i.e. Figure 30, the TG 

profiles should present same TG profile associated with the carbide 

oxidation, i.e. Figure 57, which was not the observed behaviour.

carbide powder yielded from different temperature range of isothermal 

mass gain.

The parabolic trend present in these curves, for which the rate is 

inversely proportional to the square root of time, is found to be obeyed 

when diffusion through the scale is the rate-determining process. It 

follows the parabolic law when it fits to equation 6 (BIRKS, et al., 

2006).

From this figure the linear trend curves (red curves in Figure 59) are 

evident, which corroborate the affirmation that this type of sample obeys 

parabolic rate law. In those curves the parameter of kinetic oxidation, k, 

is determined with the curve slope. In order to obtain the apparent 

activation energy of these samples an Arrhenius plot of ln(k) versus 

reciprocal elapsed time was recorded (see Figure 60).

From this curve the slope is the kinetics parameter oxidation, which is 

proportional to -?Eactivation/R. This curve has evidently two oxidation 

behaviours, one at lower temperature, i.e. below 900°C, and other at 

higher temperatures, i.e. above 900°C. The apparent activation energy 

until 900°C is 129.65 kJ/mol and above 900°C, when it decreases to 

16.91 kJ/mol. This observation implies that until 900°C aluminium 

carbide oxidizes with slower rates than above the mentioned 

temperature.

An evaluation of the oxidation kinetics of aluminium carbide, which is 

produced through the RBMAO process, was considered in order to 

quantitatively determining oxidation parameters of the aluminium 

carbide in this environment. Figure 61 presents weight gain of

Figure 63 - Parameter of kinetic oxidation of Al4C3 RBMAO sample. 

This curve has evidently three oxidation behaviours, one more than the 

observed in Figure 60. The first on is at low temperature, one between 

800 and 1000°C and finally one at high temperature. At 800°C a change 

in the behaviour is observed. The apparent activation energy until 800°C 

is 156.72 kJ/mol and above 800°C it decreases to 30.51 kJ/mol and 

decreases even more above 1000°C to 2.10 kJ/mol. This observation 

implies that due to change in the environment, i.e. presence of mullite, 

the aluminium carbide oxidizes not only with higher rates in both lower 

and high temperature, but also changes oxidation behaviour in lower 

temperatures, i.e. 800°C, than the observed with the Aldrich™ powder.

The evaluation of the oxidation kinetics of the aluminium carbide stands 

for the justification of the production of the intermediate carbide phase 

with its oxidation afterwards, which represents RBMAO route, instead 

of oxidizing aluminium particles directly, which represents the RBAO 

route. 

In this context, firstly an oxidation kinetics experiment with 

commercially available aluminium carbide was carried out and then in a 

second moment, an experiment where the aluminium carbide produced 

throughout the RBMAO route was carried out.  

An observation in both carbide materials was that they have two values 

of apparent activation energy of oxidation, one at lower temperatures 

and other at higher temperatures. This observation infers that aluminium 

carbide presents a feature that it is not easily oxidized at lower 

temperatures but it is easily oxidized at higher temperatures. In 

comparison with metallic aluminium particle, it presents an oxidation 

reaction in narrow first range of temperature, as showed in Figure 27, 

wherein the aluminium particles oxidize in temperature range from 

550°C to 600°C, and finish its oxidation reaction in a second wider 

range of temperature, wherein the aluminium particles oxidize in 

temperature range from 750°C to 900°C. The apparent activation energy 

of oxidation of metallic aluminium powder is found to be placed in a 

range of 112-152 kJ/mol for temperatures lower 660°C, and 26-33 

kJ/mol for temperature above 660°C (WU, et al., 1993). 
Because the carbide oxidation is kind of a shifting reaction, then it 

presents a slower rate reaction in comparison with the direct oxidation. 

A general aluminium carbide oxidation is expressed in equation 7

92 

 

where Greek letters and “x” leave place for the variations in such kind of 

reaction, which is not the focus of this discussion.  

A general metallic aluminium is expressed in equation 8. 

               
8 

According to the equations 7 and 8, carbide oxidation demands a shift 

reaction between the “C” positions with the oxygen specimens in order 

to form the oxide, nonetheless, in the metallic oxidation these shifts are 

not required. This shift behaviour may be, therefore, addressed to the 

higher apparent activation energy of oxidation of the carbide phase.  

The presented oxidation behaviour of the aluminium carbide has a 

promising application of matrix production route of all-oxide ceramics, 

due to the fact that it oxidizes with low oxidation rates at lower 

temperatures preventing the microstructure to form high flaw density 

and at high temperature the oxidation rate increases ensuring the fully 

oxidation of the carbide phase, which leaves no residual carbide phase to 

the final matrix material. 

Moreover, another observation within the results, which corroborates 

with the affirmation that carbide particles oxidize with dissimilar 

behaviour of the metallic particles, is the oxidation profile behaviour 

presented in Figure 57. In this figure, aluminium particles oxidize in a 

two-stage process, wherein the first step is featured with a very high 

exothermal reaction followed by a wider peak exothermal reaction, and 

aluminium carbide oxidized in a single stage oxidation, wherein the 

oxidation step is featured with a very wider exothermal peak. Those two 

behaviours promote dissimilar heat load to the neighbourhood of the 

particles. Since the metallic particles have very exothermal oxidation 

reaction, they generate localized temperatures up to 2000°K, which may 

be responsible for increasing the flaw density formation. The oxidation 

reaction of the carbide particle presents a wider peak, and then the 

localized temperatures are lower in comparison with the first mentioned. 

Additionally, the temperature, where the transition of the apparent 

activation energy of oxidation occurs, was observed at 900°C for the 

commercially available aluminium carbide and at 800°C for the 

RBMAO produced aluminium carbide. This behaviour may be 

associated to the mullite content, which can act as oxygen donor for the 

oxidation reaction and therefore improving the diffusion of the oxygen 

supply for the reaction.

5 DISCUSSION  

This thesis focused mainly on the feasibility of the RBMAO as an 

alternative route for production of porous materials. Discussions are 

presented in this section in order to better understand this novel route in 

its fundamental aspects.  

 

5.1 SLURRY RHEOLOGY 

As a concluding remark of section 4.2, in page 38, the usage of phenolic 

resin is at same time beneficial and detrimental. Its usage is 

advantageous due to its potential of yielding high residual carbon after 

pyrolysis and producing prepregs with enough green handling strength. 

However, it is detrimental due to its characteristic of form organized 

structure between the resin and the raw material particles, which results 

in increasing viscosity. Alternatively, the replacement of most phenolic 

resin by graphite powder is a promising way to keep the slurry within 

the desired features for using in composite panel production.  

 

5.2 THERMAL TREATMENT 

As a concluding remark in section 4.3, in page 44, the two-stage thermal 

treatment proved its necessity to be performed in two steps. In this way, 

the reaction thermal treatment produces the intermediate carbide phase 

and the oxidation thermal treatment oxidizes subsequently this carbide 

phase. Therefore, the two-stage thermal treatment enables the production 

of the final oxide ceramic phase through and intermediate carbide phase, 

which will be discussed further in section 5.4 the importance its 

application. 

 

5.3 MECHANICAL STRENGTH  

As concluding remarks in section 4.8, in page 58, the RBMAO can be 

classified in the same reliable category of the RBAO process, due to its 

Weibull parameter similarity the last mentioned group. Moreover, in 

comparison of samples same compaction setup, the RBMAO samples 

presented higher strength than the adapted RBAO samples. 

 
5.4 OXIDATION KINETICS 

As a concluding remark in section 4.10, in page 84, the usage of the 

intermediate phase is justified due to the lower oxidation rate at lower 

temperatures, which contributes with the lower formation of flaw 



94 

 

density, and the increasing of the oxidation rate at higher temperature, 

which ensures complete carbide oxidation. 

  



95 

6 CONCLUSION 

A summary of the concluding remarks is: 

? According to the presented features of the RBMAO novel route 
and to the particular requirements for composite production, 

hence the route can be considered successfully developed. 

? The use of phosphate ester as dispersant for such slurry is a 
promising alternative; 

? The replacement of the phenolic resin by graphite powder 
produces a sensible viscosity decreasing, which allows the solid 

content to increase up to 47 vol. % without crossing the 

viscosity value of 50 MPa.s; 

? The application of DTA/TG analyses for the thermal treatment 
set points was as promising tool. The two-stage thermal 

treatment was properly proposed and after analysis of present 

final phases, then the two-stage thermal treatment can be 

considered successfully developed, since it promoted the 

formation of the intermediate carbide phase and the final oxide 

ceramic phase; 

? The ceramic matrix mechanical properties were evaluated and 
Weibull parameter was determined, i.e., 10.54, and ?0 , i.e. 

14,15 MPa, with ?max, i.e. 16.1 MPa, which are placed in 

between the group of WOR50 and WOR200. This mechanical 

behaviour is addressed with the more evident sintering features 

presented by the WR50 samples.  

? The observation of the SEM and FE-SEM images of the 
composite panel cross section shown a microstructure with low 

flaw density. 

? Further viscosity evaluations are required for producing slurry 
with correct parameters to be used for infiltration process of the 

fibres bundles. 

? Kinetics parameters of commercially available and RBMAO 
process produced Al4C3 were determined. It was found a two 

regimes oxidation kinetics for Aldrich™ Al4C3 and three 

regimes for RBMAO Al4C3, wherein oxidizes with lower rates 

at lower temperature in comparison with the metallic particle 
and oxidizes with high rates at higher temperatures, which 

ensure the total oxidation of the carbide yielding in an entirely 

oxidizes ceramic phase.  



96 

 

? The novel ceramic production route for application in porous 
matrix of all-oxide ceramic composite was suggested and 

proven as a promising alternative. 

? RBMAO presents dissimilar features in comparison with other 
reaction bonding techniques due to two facts, first of all, it 

produced an intermediate phase and second due to the directly 

addition of mullite within the raw materials.

7 SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE WORK 

 

7.1 IDEAL VISCOSITY FOR FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION: 

Although the main target of this work was to develop a route for all-

oxide composites matrix production, which was successfully achieved, 

the proper composite panel was not produced due to the slurry viscosity 

characteristic. Nevertheless, some interim results in this field bring up 

some possibilities for solving the high viscosity problem, which 

comprised the replacement of the major amount of  phenolic resin by 

graphite powder. Additionally, for the resin it is in charge not only to 

supply carbon, but also to consolidate the prepregs. It was also suggested 

that the addition of small part of phenolic resin may enable prepregs 

consolidation. In order to produce a proper composite panel, therefore, 

more infiltrations experiments applying the modified slurry are yet 

required.  

 

7.2 POROUS WICK STRUCTURES FOR CAPILLARY EVAPORATORS 

The technique may be adapted for production of porous wicks structure 

to be used in capillary evaporators. The parts produced out from the 

RBMAO exhibit desirable mechanical strength for the particular 

application and may be pressed in order to manufacture flat cylinder 

shaped parts, which is suitable for flat capillary evaporators. Researches 

in this field are already been undertaken.
