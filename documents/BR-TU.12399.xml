Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

I 
 

Resumo  

A identificação e diferenciação de depósitos de invasões marinhas extremas (i.e. tsunamis e 

tempestades), é essencial para a reconstrução da sua distribuição espacial e para a determinação de 

tempos de recorrência de eventos desta natureza. As características de depósitos de paleotsunamis podem 

variar de local para local com as características geomorfológicas e sedimentológicas do sector costeiro em 

análise, bem como, com a deposição e/ou erosão associadas à inundação e ao retorno das ondas. Estes 

factores tornam o reconhecimento de paleotsunamis, numa sequência sedimentar, uma tarefa ousada. 

Além de que, existem também variadíssimas similaridades entre depósitos sedimentares de tsunamis e de 

tempestades, o que pode restringir de sobremaneira a precisão no seu reconhecimento e, 

consequentemente, na determinação de períodos de retorno para invasões marinhas extremas. 

Esta trabalho tem como objectivo fundamental contribur para mitigar estas dificuldades, focando-se 

sobre a aplicação de análise litoestratigráfica, textural, morfoscópica, microtextural e de composição 

mineralógica, para identificar depósitos de inundações marinhas extremas e determinar as suas prováveis 

fontes sedimentares. O trabalho aqui apresentado emerge do estudo de uma variedade de locais (Salgados 

e Boca do Rio - Portugal; Lhok Nga - Indonésia; Voe of Scatsta e Stoneybridge - Escócia) e considera 

eventos de diferentes cronologias e fontes distintas (tsunami: AD 1755, 26 de dezembro de 2004 e 

Storegga; e a Grande Tempestade, de 11 de Janeiro de 2005) que afectaram, e deixaram registo 

sedimentar peculiar, áreas com diferentes ambientes sedimentares e condições oceanográficas regionais. 

Os métodos usados nas amostras de cada área de estudo foram: interpretação litoestratigráfica, 

granulometria, análise e interpretação de dados texturais; caracterização de populações sedimentares 

através de análise morfoscópica, caracterização microtextural de grãos de quartzo usando imagens de 

microscópio electrónico de varrimento e estudo das associações de minerais pesados. 

A costa Sul do Algarve caracteriza-se por um regime de agitação de baixa energia e é raramente 

afectada por tsunamis ou tempestades muito intensas. O tsunami mais devastador que afectou a costa 

portuguesa em tempos históricos foi o de 1 de Novembro de 1755. Vários estudos discutiram a 

sedimentação associada a este evento no Algarve em contextos rochosos do Barlavento (Furnas, Barranco, 

Martinhal e Boca do Rio) e num único caso do Sotavento (Ria Formosa). No presente trabalho descreve-se 

uma nova ocorrência sedimentar detectada na depressão dos Salgados (Algarve central) cuja 

caracterização original, enquadramento na sequência de colmatação holocénica, datação e origem se 

apresentam e discutem. A depressão dos Salgados localiza-se na baía entre Armação de Pêra e a ponta da 

Galé. Este troço costeiro contém uma praia arenosa intermédia-reflectiva com 6 km de comprimento, 

marginada por um cordão dunar múltiplo, vegetado (cota apical entre 3 e 17m acima do nível médio do

mar), que reveste um afloramento alongado de beachrock e eolianitos holocénicos. Obtiveram-se 145 

sondagens curtas (&amp;lt;1.5m) e 13 “longas” (2 a 4.5m), no enchimento sedimentar da Lagoa dos Salgados. 

Onze amostras de lodo orgânico foram datadas por 14C e um testemunho sujeito a análise de 210Pb e 137Cs. 

Foi possível caracterizar 6 unidades litoestratigráficas fundamentais, acumuladas na segunda metade do 

Holocénico ao abrigo de uma barreira já estabelecida e contemporâneas de um nível do mar próximo do 

actual. As unidades denominadas A, B e a C, depositadas pós ca. 5900 BP são constituídas por areias com 

intercalações vasosas e vasas com intercalações arenosas, com transição lateral de fácies frequente. Estas 

unidades correspondem ao preenchimento da depressão em ambiente subtidal a intertidal inferior, com 

crescente influência marinha para o topo. As unidades D e F, com cerca de 1m de espessura, são 

constituídas por vasas mais ou menos arenosas. 

Intercalada entre as unidades D e F, e aproximadamente a 0.40m de profundidade, ocorre uma 

lâmina lateralmente contínua, formada essencialmente por areia média com abundantes bioclastos e 

intraclastos de lodo, com espessura variável entre 0.8m e alguns milímetros, diminuindo para terra. Na sua 

região distal o calibre da areia diminui e observou-se granulotriagem positiva nos testemunhos com maior 

espessura. O contacto basal é erosivo e a transição a tecto bem marcada. O depósito apresenta-se em 

forma de gota alongada e estende-se para terra até um máximo de aproximadamente 800m. O perfil vertical 

do excesso de 210Pb e 137Cs indica uma taxa de sedimentação de 2.6mm/ano nos 0.30m superficiais. A 

extrapolação deste valor localiza a base dos lodos a tecto da unidade E na primeira metade do século XIX e 

as idades radiocarbono do sedimento subjacente à unidade E sugerem ablação de espessura considerável 

de lodos aquando da deposição das areias. Estes resultados são consistentes com um evento raro de 

inundação marinha extrema e muito intensa de um espaço lagunar muito assoreado, com injecção de 

sedimento exótico a grande distância da linha de costa, excedendo a capacidade de transporte das 

correntes de maré e do galgamento por tempestade. Trata-se do único registo deste tipo de evento 

detectado nesta coluna sedimentar nos últimos séculos e compatível com o tsunami gerado pelo sismo de 1 

de Novembro de 1755, do qual existem testemunhos documentais nesta região. Para a determinação de 

prováveis fontes sedimentares foram recolhidas ainda cerca de 30 amostras sedimentares de análogos 

actuais (i.e. praia, duna e fundos submarinos), foram ainda detectadas evidências de um possível depósito 

arenoso de tempestade intercalado na unidade lodosa de topo e constrangido espacialmente à zona 

adjacente à barra. 

Outra área de estudo foi a planície aluvionar de Boca do Rio (também situada no Barlavento 

algarvio, próximo da Praia da Salema). Nesta localização uma unidade litoestratigráfica associada ao 

tsunami de AD 1755 foi reconhecida anteriormente por diversos autores. A área aluvionar é constituída por 

uma planície de inundação supratidal que é periodicamente sujeita a inundações fluviais. Esta encontra-se 

separada do mar por uma barreira de cascalho e areia e por um esporão rochoso que, juntos, impedem o 

galgamento durante as tempestades mais frequentes. Amostras de sedimentos depositados pelo tsunami e 

de análogos actuais foram recolhidas nesta área e analisadas neste trabalho. Três amostras de tsunami

(correspondente a um perfil normal à linha de costa) foram detalhadamente estudadas. Adicionalmente, 11 

amostras de sedimentos (cinco de fundos submarinos, três de duna, uma praia e duas recolhidas na 

planície aluvial) também foram recuperadas e utilizadas neste trabalho para caracterizar ambientes 

sedimentares actuais (possíveis fontes sedimentares do tsunami). 

Nas ilhas Shetland (Escócia) uma lâmina arenosa intercalada em turfas tem sido comummente 

associada ao tsunami provocado pelo deslizamento submarino de Storegga que terá ocorrido à ca. 8000 

BP. Esta unidade litoestratigráfica composta por areia média a grosseira caracteriza-se pelo contacto 

erosivo basal, incorporação de clastos de camadas subjacentes e pela sua granulotriagem positiva. Quatro 

amostras, recolhidas nesta unidade, a partir das paredes de duas trincheiras escavadas na enseada de Voe 

of Scatsta (Sullom Voe), separadas por menos de 50 m, e alinhadas transversalmente, foram estudadas em 

pormenor. Cada par de amostras estudadas contém uma amostra correspondente à base do depósito de 

areia e uma segunda amostra, localizada perto do contacto superior da unidade tsunamigénica. 

Por sua vez, Stoneybridge localiza-se na costa oeste da ilha de South Uist (arquipélago das 

Hebrides, Escócia). Sedimentos depositados por ondas de tempestade foram recuperados imediatamente 

após a denominada Grande Tempestade de 11 de janeiro de 2005. Este evento provocou extensa erosão 

nalgumas localizações costeiras e noutras (e.g. Stoneybridge) depositou uma contrastante e espessa 

camada arenosa (areia média a fina) a consideráveis distâncias da costa. Quatro amostras sedimentares 

deste tempestito foram analisadas neste trabalho. 

Lhok Nga Bay (Samatra, Indonésia) é uma praia contínua em baía, quebrada por pequenas fozes 

de ribeiros sazonais, que foi fortemente afectada pelo tsunami de 26 de Dezembro de 2004. As amostras 

utilizadas neste trabalho foram recolhidas algumas semanas após esse evento. Estas correspondem a um 

perfil normal à linha de costa sendo importante notar que nalgumas localizações mais do que uma amostra 

do sedimento tsunamigénico foi recolhida por forma a avaliar as variações verticais do depósito. Os 

depósitos associados ao tsunami de 2004 consistem em areias média a grosseira, acinzentada a 

amarelada, que exibem variações laterais e verticais de espessura e dimensão. O contacto inferior da 

unidade tsunamigénico é erosivo. A espessura dos depósitos de tsunami diminui para terra. 

O facto de o registo sedimentar de uma série significativa de eventos de inundações marinhas 

extremas, com morfologias e cronologias diversas, ter sido analisado permitiu a utilização e a generalização 

da aplicação de técnicas sedimentológicas, tais como a análise microtextural em grão de quartzo e a 

composição mineralógica de amostras de tsunami e tempestade, bem como, das suas prováveis fontes 

sedimentares. 

Os depósitos de tempestade e tsunami estudados constituem uma peculiaridade litoestratigráfica, 

um carácter arenoso, apresentando também um contacto basal abrupto ou erosivo, diminuindo de 

dimensão verticalmente e diminuindo de espessura horizontalmente. Os depósitos de tsunami exibem uma 

notável variação lateral em todas as características sedimentares e geométricas, mesmo em distâncias 

curtas, e todos apresentam uma estrutura interna massiva, com excepção do caso mais recente (tsunami

de 26 de Dezembro de 2004 em Lhok Nga - Indonésia). Estes depósitos tsunamigénicos apresentam 

também uma frequente incorporação de clastos de camadas subjacentes que foram erodidos durante o 

processo de inundação das ondas. 

Os resultados obtidos a partir do estudo morfoscópico de partículas arenosas (e.g. esfericidade e 

forma) revelaram que nos casos das amostras dos Salgados e Boca do Rio (Portugal) e Lhok Nga 

(Indonésia), que estes atributos são úteis na discriminação de ambientes sedimentares e/ou no 

estabelecimento de material fonte que alimenta os depósitos de tsunami. 

Resultados da análise microtextural revelaram que esta prática é uma técnica sedimentológica 

complementar valiosa e que pode ser aplicada quer na discriminação de ambientes sedimentares, bem 

quer na identificação de depósitos de inundação marinhas extremas, especialmente se levado em 

consideração o contexto regional sedimentológico e geomorfológico. As superfícies dos grãos de quartzo 

das amostras de tsunami e tempestade analisadas revelaram uma presença mais destacada de marcas de 

percussão e superfícies recentes. Este resultado inovador foi detectado em todas as localizações 

geográficas estudadas.  

Determinou-se que, genericamente, a concentração de minerais pesados na fração de sedimento 

total diminui para topo nas camadas tsunamigénicas e nos tempestitos analisados. Num dos locais 

estudados (Salgados), foi possível estabelecer que o conteúdo de minerais pesados apresenta 

semelhanças qualitativas e quantitativas com as amostras de dunas. Em Lhok Nga (Indonésia) e Boca do 

Rio (Portugal), também foi possível identificar uma assinatura mineralógica específica da deposição 

associada ao processo de retorno das ondas de tsunami. 

O reconhecimento da assinatura sedimentar do mesmo evento tsunamigénico (AD 1755) e a sua 

contextualização estratigráfica forneceu motivos para sugerir uma escala milenar como período de retorno 

para eventos. No entanto, as limitações na identificação e diferenciação no registo sedimentar de 

evidências geológicas de inundações marinhas extremas (e.g. a preservação do depósito, a inexistência de 

contrastes litológicos e texturais, etc.) precisam ser superadas para que seja possível estabelecer períodos 

de retorno com maior assertividade. 

A diferenciação entre depósitos de tsunami e de tempestade foi essencialmente evidenciada pela 

incorporação de clastos de camadas subjacentes em depósitos tsunamigénicos enquanto se observou a 

sua ausência nos depósitos de tempestade analisados. 

Resultados globais deste trabalho sugerem que características locais geomorfológicas e 

sedimentares podem limitar extrapolações acríticas sobre os mecanismos de deposição (tsunami vs 

tempestade) de aplicação generalizada a todo o mundo. Em alguns casos analisados (Salgados e Boca do 

Rio) foi possível evidenciar quais os prováveis materiais fonte de cada um desses depósitos 

tsunamigénicos. Este trabalho demonstra ainda a utilidade de técnicas sedimentológicas tais como textura,

morfoscopia, análise microtextural e composicional e contribuí para aumentar os critérios sedimentológicos 

a ser utilizados no reconhecimento e diferenciação de depósitos de tsunami e tempestade. 

 

Os objetivos iniciais estabelecidos para este trabalho foram alcançados: 

a) Unidades litoestratigráficas depositadas por inundações marinhas extremas, durante o 

Holocénico, foram identificadas, descritas, caracterizadas e datadas; 

b) As amostras foram analisadas usando uma abordagem multidisciplinar, que incluiu a 

caracterização e interpretações litoestratigráficas, geométricas, dimensionais, texturais, de características 

microtextural e composicionais, tendo sido abordadas as contrastantes escalas espaciais (que vão desde a 

escala do afloramento ou coluna sedimentar à microscopia de partículas individuais) para alcançar uma 

interpretação dos processos que controlam o transporte e deposição de sedimentos terrígenos de alta 

energia durante eventos extremos de inundação marinha; 

c) A análise microtextural foi aplicada em grãos de quartzo a fim de determinar o material fonte 

e/ou para identificar assinaturas específicas de inundações marinhas extremas. Esta metodologia foi 

testada com resultados encorajadores; 

d) A composição mineralógica da malha de amostragem foi utilizada, com resultados relevantes, 

para estabelecer os materiais fonte e/ou determinar composições específicas de amostras depositadas por 

inundações marinhas extremas. 

e) Foi feita uma previsão, com base no registo sedimentar, sobre períodos de retorno para 

inundações tsunamigénicas para a costa do Algarve, em Portugal; 

f) De forma genérica, esta tese contribuiu para o desenvolvimento do conhecimento actual sobre 

os critérios usados para caracterizar os sedimentos depositados por eventos extremos de inundação 

marinha, e para aumentar a nossa capacidade de distinguir e relacionar esses depósitos com cada 

processo forçador (i.e. tsunamis ou tempestades).

Abstract 

This thesis aims to characterize (and distinguish) tsunami and storm deposits in the sedimentary 

record by focusing on the application of textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and compositional analysis, 

and establish their likely source materials. This work presents results from a variety of locations (Portugal, 

Indonesia and Scotland) and considers events of different chronologies and sources (AD 1755, 26 

December 2004 and Storegga Slide tsunamis; Great Storm of 11 January 2005) that affected contrasting 

coastal settings with different regional oceanographic conditions. Typically these statigraphically peculiar 

(essentially sand-sized) deposits exhibited an abrupt basal contact, thinning and finning inland, massive 

structure and relevant lateral variation. Differentiation between tsunami and storm deposits was evidenced 

by the incorporation of rip-up clasts solely in the tsunamigenic deposits. Grain surface microtextural analysis 

proved to be a valuable complementary technique to be applied in the identification of extreme marine 

inundation deposits, especially when considered within a regional context. Tsunami and storm grains 

presented a more frequent presence of percussion marks and fresh surfaces when compared with potential 

source material. Generally the concentration of heavy minerals decreased up unit and in Salgados 

(Portugal) the assemblage presented similarities with dune samples. In Lhok Nga (Indonesia) and Boca do 

Rio (Portugal) it was possible to identify a mineralogical signature of the tsunami backwash.  

The assumption of a tsunami millennial return period for the Algarve (Portugal) coast was possible 

through the study of the lithostratigraphy of two locations affected by the AD1755. Overall results revealed 

that site-specific effects precluded clear-cut extrapolations on a storm vs tsunami emplacement mechanism 

of worldwide application although it demonstrated that the use of textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and 

heavy mineral data will enhance the criteria to recognize and differentiate these deposits if the regional 

context is sufficiently constrained.

Acknowledgments 

This thesis is the culmination of a long journey that began in early 2008. Many adventures, 

misadventures, joys and sorrows were experienced during the execution of this work. The motivation to 

complete this doctoral thesis was fuelled by the valuable assistance of many people. In the following 

statement I present my deep gratitude to all those people. 

I would like to express my enormous gratitude to my supervisor and friend Professor César 

Andrade for his dedication, commitment and ingenuity in various stages of the Ph.D. His support, reviews, 

ethic, rigor and enthusiasm with which he addresses any issue of Coastal Geology, was and will be an 

example to follow. It was a privilege to be his student, and if today I feel a better geologist I have to be 

thankful, in a very great part, to Professor César. 

My heartfelt thanks to my co-supervisor and friend Professor Alastair Dawson with whom I learned 

immensely about tsunami deposits and storminess. The numerous visits to Scotland were unique 

opportunities to enrich me as a geologist and as a person. His commitment to the successful completion of 

this thesis was crucial. The way Alastair explains complex concepts with a disarming simplicity will, forever, 

be an example to follow. 

Professor Conceição Freitas, although not officially my co-supervisor, was instrumental in the 

success of this work by how earnestly she helped in the completion of this thesis. Her unique work capacity, 

management skills, her attention to detail and her scientific accuracy are of such quality that I will seek to 

follow them in the coming years. 

To Prof. William Mahaney my sincere and deep thanks for his support throughout this thesis. The 

short-visit to Toronto (Canada) was, without a doubt, one of the defining moments of this Ph.D. The 

contribution of Bill Mahaney did not stopped in the microtextural analysis, our frequent conversations and the 

privilege of working with him provided me the knowledge on a range of other geological subjects. 

I am sincerely thankful to Dr João Cascalho (MNHN) for his invaluable help in the observation of heavy 

minerals and for the important discussions on various geological subjects. My thanks to Dr Raphael Paris  

(Université Clermont, France) who contributed to this work as a supervisor of a short-visit to Clermont-

Ferrand, also with numerous conversations about tsunami deposits and with the very kind offer of sediment 

samples collected in Lhok Nga. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Lenka Lisa (Institute of Geology, 

Czech Republic) for her guidance and support during a short-visit to Prague. I express my appreciation to 

Prof. Pedro Cunha and Prof. Jorge Dinis (University of Coimbra) for stimulating discussions on the 

stratigraphy and age-estimation of tsunamigenic deposits. I am thankful to Dr Sebastião Teixeira for the 

generous offer of nearshore samples (Armação de Pêra, Portugal) and for his availability to help during this

My sincere gratitude to Luís Ramos, Filipe Saavedra, Angelina, João Brito, João Caldas, Bruno 

Soares, Nelo Guedes, Ana Morais, Hugo Brito, Ana F., Zira, Ricardo Branco, Adelino and other friends that 

always gave me moments where true and unquestionable friendship served as an important support and 

motivation to pursue and conclude this thesis. 

A special word to my grandfather José Miranda, my grandmother Alice, to Rui H., Paula and Carla 

my profound thanks for their support and for motivating me at different stages in the long path that brought 

me from secondary school to the present academic achievement. 

A special and heartfelt thanks to my uncle Joaquim, Fátima, João, Octávio and José Mário, and to 

my brother Jorge, my sister-in-law Ana and my nephew José because always, and in all moments, they 

supported and encouraged me in a unique way. 

With the completion of this thesis I give my parents a brief proud moment. Those moments are the 

humblest way a son can thank their parents, especially in my case because they always trusted on me and 

never asked for anything in return. The many good examples that they gave me, will last with me. 

My deepest thanks to the centre of my life: my son and Ana. Rui, my son, has changed and 

enriched my life in an inimitable way, and was also a strong motivation to complete the thesis.  

I am deeply grateful to Ana who accompanied me throughout this adventure and with whom I 

shared all the frustrations, joys, disappointments, achievements and who always gave me a peaceful and 

permanent support, help, understanding, friendship, companionship and love. 

For all, Obrigado!

1. Introduction 

1.1. Relevance of study 

The study and understanding of coastal hazards is a fundamental aspect for most modern 

societies. The consequences of extreme events such as tsunamis and storms are being regarded as major 

threats for coastal regions. Furthermore, the rising costs of natural hazards (in human lives and 

economically) as a direct effect of the increasing occupation of the coast has raised the public awareness on 

the importance of the study of these events. Although many studies have been conducted in this subject 

there is still a wide range of aspects that need further investigation in order to fundament effective mitigation 

or adaptation procedures. Because of the non-deterministic nature of processes underlying coastal 

inundation the quantitative approach to their occurrence is in essence empirical and requires long series of 

observations to fundament estimations of vulnerability and risk. Some scientists have extended the empirical 

database beyond the historical record through the use of palaeoevent sedimentary deposits and have 

derived frequency and intensity estimates from the stratigraphic record. Because palaeoevent analyses are 

used to predict event recurrence and to conduct vulnerability and risk assessments, it is essential to be able 

to distinguish between tsunami and storm deposits in the sedimentary record. In that sense, the 

enhancement of the recognition and differentiation of tsunami and storm sedimentological signatures 

through the application of diverse techniques is a pertinent and innovative contribution of this work, which 

applies microtextural analysis and heavy mineral characterization to discuss marine inundation deposits and 

their possible source materials together with other attributes more widely used. Furthermore, this thesis 

presents results from a variety of geographical locations (Portugal, Indonesia and Scotland), of different 

chronologies (AD 1755, 26th December 2004, the 2nd Storegga Slide tsunamis and the Great Storm of 11th 

January 2005) and different coastline configurations and contrasting oceanographic conditions (Figure 1.1). 

The use of such a multiplicity of contexts provides a unique sustenance for conclusions to be drawn 

regarding the characterization and differentiation of extreme marine inundations sedimentary signatures. 

 

1.2. Aims and objectives 

This work offers a novel opportunity to address a relevant aspect for many coastal areas worldwide: 

to extend the time dimension of the database analysed for the establishment of extreme marine inundation 

risks. With that purpose a location in the Algarve coast of Portugal (Salgados), where a new tsunamigenic 

deposit associated with the AD 1755 was observed and characterized, is presented. This location offers a 

number of features providing further evidences of the path followed by the tsunami overwash and hopefully 

will contribute to the clarification of the on-going debate about the AD 1755 epicentre and tsunami

generation area. Furthermore, the re-analyses of several locations (Boca do Rio, Sullom Voe and Lhok 

Nga), where tsunami deposits have been previously detected, allows an adequate background to test the 

application of different sedimentological proxies in areas that suffered from the  impact of extreme marine 

inundations of which independent descriptions exist and where the sediment record conserved evidences of 

those events. 

A specific storm deposit (Stoneybridge, Scottish Outer Hebrides) was also analysed and compared 

with tsunamigenic signatures from the above mentioned locations. The fact that a significant range of 

locations, age and events were analysed permits the successful application and generalization of techniques 

such as grain microtextural imprints and mineralogical signature observed in samples from all locations. 

Although local details can be relevant factors, an important achievement of this work is to test and increase 

the number of proxies that can be used in the sedimentological analysis of tsunami and storm deposits. 

In agreement with the line of thought mentioned above, a number of work purposes were identified 

and subsequent field and office work and laboratory analyses were conducted in order to achieve the 

following objectives: 

a) To recognize coastal sediments deposited by Holocene extreme marine inundations; 

b) To analyse sediment samples using a multidisciplinary approach; 

c) To apply microtextural analysis in order to establish the source material or/and to identify specific 

signatures of extreme marine inundations in coastal sediments; 

d) To apply heavy minerals to establish source material or/and to identify specific signatures of 

extreme marine inundations in those materials; 

e) To forward, whenever possible, return periods for extreme marine inundations; 

f) To contribute to developing criteria able to recognize and differentiate tsunami and storm 

deposits.

1.3. Structure of document 

This document is organized in order to present the data in association with each study area mainly 

due to the fact that this structure would provide the reader the opportunity to analyse each case on its own 

and generalize interpretations and conclusions at a later stage. The adopted structure also permits a better 

understanding of each methodological result regardless of the number of samples (that varied due to 

constrains in sampling). 

The thesis is divided in an introductory part (Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4), a data presentation part 

(Chapter 5) and a discussion and conclusion part (Chapters 6 and 7). Chapter 1 presents a brief description 

of the aims and structure of the thesis. This chapter stresses the relevance of this research for the wider 

problem of coastal hazard and the contribution to tsunami and storm sedimentary recognition and their 

differentiation. Chapter 2 is organized in five sub-chapters. Sub-chapter 2.1 presents a concise summary of 

the physical aspects associated with storms and tsunamis (i.e. generation, propagation, run-up and 

backwash). The following sub-chapter (2.2) considers the geological signature of extreme marine 

inundations by presenting a summary of the work conducted and by describing the different types of 

characteristics associated with these extreme marine events. Sub-chapter 2.3 presents a revision of the 

criteria associated with the recognition of tsunami deposits in coastal stratigraphy. Sub-chapter (2.4) debates 

the controversy associated with the differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits and the respective coastal

hazards. A summary of previous research conducted in the study areas is the focus of sub-chapter 2.5. This 

sub-chapter is sub-divided in three parts, one for each regional study area (Algarve, Scotland and 

Indonesia). The detailed geographical, geological and oceanographic characterization of the study areas is 

the focus of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the methodology used in this research. A description of the 

sampling, lithostratigraphic, textural, morphoscopic, micromorphological, microtextural, mineralogical and 

age-estimation techniques used in this work are presented in this chapter. Chapter 5 presents results from 

Salgados (Algarve, Portugal), Boca do Rio (Algarve, Portugal), Voe of Scasta (Shetland Islands, Scotland), 

Lhok Nga (Sumatra, Indonesia) and Stoneybridge (Hebrides Islands, Scotland). This chapter is divided into 

five sub-chapters (i.e. one for each specific study area). The results in each sub-chapter are presented in the 

following order: lithostratigraphic, textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and mineralogical results. In the 

lithostratigraphy section the sampling strategy, the lithostratigraphic data, the spatial architecture of the 

deposit and the chronology are presented. In the textural results, the data presented include an analysis of 

grain-size characteritics. The morphoscopy data presents the percentage of quartz, lithic material and 

bioclasts within the studied samples, as well as the roundness and sphericity character of quartz grains from 

the analysed samples. The microtextural results include the exoscopic analysis of quartz grains. Finally, the 

mineralogical results provide an analysis of the heavy mineral content for each study area. 

The final part of the thesis is dedicated to the Discussion (Chapter 6) and Conclusions (Chapter 7). 

Chapter 6 interprets and discusses the results presented in the previous chapter and it is divided into eight 

sub-chapters. Sub-chapter 6.1 considers the textural and lithostratigraphical features of extreme marine 

inundations. Sub-chapter 6.2 debates the morphoscopic signatures of the analysed tsunami and storm 

samples. The following sub-chapter (6.3) discusses the microtextural features associated with extreme 

marine events. Sub-chapter 6.4 comprises an investigation of heavy mineral assemblages as an aid in the 

differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits. Sub-chapter 6.5 briefly discusses the differentiation of 

sedimentary environments. Sub-chapter 6.6 compares several sedimentological characteristics of deposits 

lay down by a single event. Sub-chapter 6.7 widens the discussion by addressing the sedimentological 

characterization of multi-tsunamigenic events. The succeeding sub-chapter (6.8) presents an analysis of the 

sedimentary characteristics of tsunami and storm deposits while comparing different events. 

The conclusions in chapter 7 summarize the major achievements and inferences resulting from this 

work and these are completed by the proposal of future research lines and work to be conducted in this field 

of Science. In addition to the main document, this Ph.D. thesis includes supplementary information 

organized in 2 Annexes. Annex 1 consists of the geological legend of the Geological map of the Algarve. 

Annex 2 presents an Atlas of microtextural features observed in quartz grains; this annex provides a 

comprehensive view of the full variety of microtextures found, studied and interpereted by the author and is a 

contribution to the few existing publications on microtexture characterization and interpretation of quartz 

grains.

2. State of the art 

2.1. Extreme marine inundations: origin and mechanisms 

Extreme marine inundations triggered by tsunami and storms have an undoubtedly important 

significance for studies on coastal evolution and coastal management. The investigation of these events is a 

major concern for many scientists, trying to understand the underlying processes and contributing to mitigate 

impacts of the inundations. The understanding of the associated physics is of unquestionable interest for 

obvious reasons, but also from a (less immediate) geological perspective: allowing a better comprehension 

of the consequences of such events, namely of those that will certainly occur in the future with magnitude 

exceeding the largest observed or documented event in history. 

Storms are produced by meteorological disturbances and generate high energy waves and surf, 

whereas the most frequent causes of tsunamis are related with offshore rupture and significant vertical 

displacement of the seafloor, thus implying large magnitude ruptures. These are induced either by tectonic 

stress and associated to earthquakes, or by both sub-areal and submarine large-scale landslides. 

Furthermore, meteorite impacts and the collapse of volcanic buildings and other large-scale volcanic 

processes may also generate tsunamis. 

Storms are one of the most alarming natural hazards due to their frequency at annual time scales 

and concentration of resources and population in coastal areas. The erosional capacity of storms is one of 

its main features; however, in some circumstances, storms can also leave a sedimentological signature in 

the stratigraphy of a given coastal area normally resting above sea level, if overwash allows for extensive 

inundation of the landward section of the coastal area by sediment-loaded marine water. Storms are 

produced by effects of wind and atmospheric-pressure differences in the surface of the ocean. Storms can 

be classified in agreement with the Beaufort wind scale (Table 2.1). 

Extreme storms such as hurricanes (also called Typhoons in the Indian Ocean) are produced when 

high-speed winds tend to spiral inland towards a core of very low pressure. When any storm occurs the rise 

in wave heights (and thus in the energy they carry and dissipate at the coast when breaking) is noticeable. In 

addition to wave energy, low pressure may increase the sea level well above the astronomical tide level, 

raising the ocean surface by considerable amounts and facilitating the inundation of the coastal land. 

Storms are major agents of coastal forcing given their potential to transport sediments alongshore 

and cross-shore. According to Andrade et al. (2004) clastic shores in mesoscale equilibrium with the wave 

regime, as well as starved coasts, are particularly sensitive to storms because the instantaneous 

disturbances generated by storms may exceed the resilience of the coastal system, which is unable to 

resume the previous equilibrium conditions in the absence of a relevant external source of sediment.

It is necessary to examine the past decadal- to millennial-scale variability of storm activity in order 

to determine the frequency of the most extreme events in relation to the climate evolution. Regional studies 

on the long-term variability of storm frequency, magnitude and tracks and of storm-related hazards (e.g. 

Orford et al., 1996; Langenberg et al., 1999; Kaas et al., 2000) suggest that they have been changing 

throughout the last 150 years, although there is no evidence of a trend in this time interval The extension of 

the observation period further back in time, therefore including the geological record, allows the 

reconstruction of  storminess patterns that may be used to re-evaluate the return period of most extreme 

events, which are generally extrapolated from short-term instrumental series of observations (Andrade et al., 

2004). Furthermore, it has been established that negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index winters are 

associated with a southward shift in the Atlantic storm activity and a noticeable increase in storm activity in 

Iberia (Hurrell, 2003). They are also reflected in Portugal by increased precipitation and fluvial floods (Trigo 

et al., 2004), as well as higher sea-level caused by barometric lows and reinforced westerly winds (Guerra et 

al., 2000). An inverse correlation between NAO values and the solar activity was also established (Kirov and 

Georgieva, 2002) and consequently low solar irradiance corresponds to lower storminess. One can state 

that research on causes and variations in storm intensity, and especially in investigation of storminess 

trends, is a key issue in projecting the impact of storminess in the future evolution of coasts. In this context, 

finding sedimentological records of past catastrophic storm events are essential to evaluate the long term 

climatic evolution in a given coastal area allowing to separate variations corresponding to trends from long 

term oscillations.

In terms of risk to coastal assets and probability of generating a conspicuous record in the coastal 

sedimentary archive surges generated by storms is their most relevant facet. Storm surges are changes in 

sea level caused by extreme weather events. In both tropical and extra-tropical regions they are generated 

by intense cyclones and especially hurricanes, the latter being characteristic of the former regions. The 

impact of the surge is dependent of the size, duration, strength, velocity and track of the meteorological 

disturbance but it also depends of the morphology and extension of the shelf margining of the target coast. 

Storm surges are common in many coastlines all over the world and literature on storm impacts is 

to a large extent biased to the settings where they play the major role in coastal forcing and responsibility for 

damages. However, this is not the case of mainland Portugal, where the dimensions and morphology of the 

shelf, location within the extratropical zone and exposurue to high wave energy, indicate that direct wave 

action exceeds in relevance the effects of storm surge (e.g. SIAM I and II project - Santos et al., 2002 and 

Santos and Miranda, 2006). In this respect, storm waves, even exceptional in energy, differ from tsunamis 

because they break and release most of the associated energy within the seaward section of the coastal 

zone. An increase in height of a wind wave will inevitably induce breaking at increased depth, thus extending 

the dimension of the surf zone. This is in clear contrast with tsunami waves which, regardless their height, 

are always very large in length, exceeding by far the longest wind-gerated wave. This makes a substantial 

difference in the type and amount of work and impact that a wind or a tsunami generated wave can produce 

when impinging on a coastal area. 

The word tsunami is a phonetic transcription from the Japanese word meaning “harbour wave”, not 

in the sense used in hydraulics and coastal enegineering (seiche) but reflecting the belief that they formed 

very close to the harbours or fishing settlements. According to Lapidus (1990), “Tsunami is the gravity-wave 

system that follows any short-duration, large-scale disturbance of the free sea surface.” A tsunami generally 

consists of a small number of long-period solitary waves that can be generated by any disturbance that 

displaces a large water mass from its equilibrium position. Tsunami waves are usually small in height and 

barely noticed in the deep ocean, but they grow in height (sometimes to dramatic dimensions) and increase 

the potential to cause damage when travelling in shallow water, namely just before impacting the coast 

(Sugawara et al., 2008). Tsunami waves can travel virtually unnoticed through the open ocean because of 

extreme low values of steepness (essentially modulated by very large wavelength), an attribute that normally 

prevents breaking throughout the whole travel distance. Thus destruction caused by tsunamis is the direct 

result of abrupt inundation of extensive costal ribbons, accompanied by impact on structures and erosion. 

Besides hitting coastal targets unbroken, one other important difference to wind waves is that the time 

intervals spent by the inundation and seaward back flow associated to each tsunami wave exceeds by at 

least two orders of magnitude the ones of a wind wave. 

The life span of a tsunami may be divided into three stages: the generation (discussed above), the 

stage of propagation to the coast and finally the inundation of the coastal fringe with intensity that may be 

quantified in terms of run-up and run-in.

The equation describing tsunami wave celerity while propagating anywhere in the sea is given by linear 

theory as the “shallow water equation”:  

  ?    Equation 2.1 

where c is wave celerity (ms-1); g is gravitic acceleration (ms-2) and h is local depth (m). 

The non-linear character of this relation, showing that celerity (and thus wavelength) solely depends 

on depth and nearly complete conservation of total energy by water waves during propagation, explains the 

dramatic consequences of shoaling effects on tsunami waves when propagating in very shallow coastal 

waters. Conservation of total energy can only be achieved if the very significant reduction in the kinetic 

component accompanying propagation in progressively shallower water is compensated by an increase in 

potential energy, measurable by the difference in elevation between crest and trough – the wave height. 

If the triggering mechanism of a tsunami corresponds to a point-source (e.g. vocanic explosion, 

slope mass movement) the waves will radiate from the source with a strong angular dispersion and affect a 

progressively wider fan-shaped domain. The length of the leading wave crest will increase exponentially with 

time and thus the associated energy density will necessarily decrease. This explains the strong attenuation 

characterizing most events triggered by avalanches, slides or volcanic activity, their impacts being felt 

essentially in targets located at short distances from the source. The exceptions are associated with 

infrequent mechanisms capable of displacing extremely large volumes along the sea floor (such as the 2nd 

Storegga slide) and affecting the shores of a wide oceanic basin. In contrast, an extensive rupture of the sea 

floor, such as promoted by a major thrust fault system, can better be described as a linear source, thus 

disturbing the simple circular-shaped radiation model. In this case, most of the wave energy is focused in the 

direction perpendicular to the strike of the main source and only the energy propagating parallel to the 

regional tectonic trend leaks laterally and is strongly diminished in density. If the rupture area is located 

close to or within a continental margin, within several minutes after generation the initial disturbance is split 

into a wave set that travels out to the deep ocean (a distant or tele-tsunami regarding the impacted areas on 

the opposite margin) and another that travels towards the nearby coast (local tsunami). Several events 

happen as the local tsunami travels over the continental slope and shelf. The most obvious one is that the 

wave amplitude increases. The tsunami energy flux, which is dependent on both the wave speed and wave 

height, remains nearly constant. Consequently, as the tsunami speed diminishes as it travels into shallower 

water, its height grows. Because of this shoaling effect, a tsunami, imperceptible at deep sea, may grow to 

be several meters in height near the coast. Moreover, the propagation path is sensitive to the ocean bottom 

morphology, an effect shared also by wind waves and described by the laws of wave refraction. Bottom 

morphology, analogously to an optical lens, may focus or defocus (sic, Tinti, 1990) the water wave rays, 

thereby increasing or decreasing the wave amplitude by modulating their energy and power density. The 

effects of refraction are more evident in the case of tsunamis given their larger wave length and explain why 

in most cases the wave angles at the shore are reduced.

As the tsunami wave travels from the deep-water through the continental slope and shelf to the 

nearshore and finally the coastal region, the height attained by the wave crest may exceed the shore 

elevation, thus allowing for inundation of terrestrial land (Figure 2.1). The excess water brought in by the 

incoming wave crest (which extends hundreds of meters into the ocean) is pushed further inland at very high 

speeds until the counter effects of attrition and gravity stop inundation from progressing further inland. The 

intensity of the inundation is usually described in terms of run-up and run-in. Run-up is usually defined as the 

maximum height attained by the flood water onshore, measured  above a reference sea level, though some 

authors have used the term to describe the maximum height (on land) reached by a tsunami as it encounters 

the coast. Both definitions yield different values characterizing the same event and the former is adopted in 

this study. Run-in or depth of inundation is the maximum horizontal distance landward of the coastline that 

the tsunami inundation was able to reach. Run-up is primarily controlled by the length and amplitude of the 

tsunami waves, coastal shape and by the bathymetric profile of the sub-littoral shelf and slope regions 

across which the tsunami is approaching the coast (Bourgeois et al. 1999; Tappin et al. 2001; Weiss et al. 

2006). In addition, roughness and slopes of the dryland met by the inrushing flood also control both the run-

up and run-in. Consequently, run-up heights, distances and flow depths of inundation can vary significantly 

along a given shoreline. 

After the inundation, part of the tsunami energy is returned back to the ocean as a huge, long-

lasting and typically channelled backwash. In addition, a tsunami can excite a particular type of standing 

waves (edge waves) that oscillate parallel to shore and are entrapped in the coastal zone. The interference 

between incoming and edge waves may further complicate the longshore distribution pattern of wave height 

at the shore with implications in run-up and run-in. Because of this complicated behaviour near the coast 

and of the changes in attrition of the coastal surface following the first inundation, the first run-up and run-in 

of a tsunami are often not the largest. The arrival of a tsunami surge is sometimes preceded by extensive 

retreat of the sea, exposing the sea-bottom, and there are several terms that are used to describe this 

phenomenon. The one to use depends on circumstances (e.g., whether the tsunami is in a bay or estuary) 

and on personal preference. The terms “negative wave”, “drawdown” and “withdrawal” are most often used 

to describe this type of initial onset. Less formal are the terms 'waterline receding' and “bay emptying”. The 

underlying reason for this effect is that both offshore landslides and earthquakes may create a negative 

pattern of disturbance of the sea surface (trough) on the shoreward side of the bottom deformation, in 

relation with sudden and localized decrease of the water depth, if this trough propagates to the shore and 

arrives there before the following crest, it produces the drawdown (GITEC-2, 1995). In coastal areas the 

devastation produced by a high magnitude tsunami can be enormous. The destruction of infrastructures 

caused by tsunamis is due to “drag and flotation forces associated with the waves (...), strong induced 

currents (...) and floating debris” (Tinti, 1990).

Stewart, 2007 after Einsele et al., 1996). 

 

The two most important aspects that characterise tsunamis are the magnitude and the intensity. 

The traditional magnitude scale is the so-called Imamura-Iida (Iida, 1963). The magnitude value (m) is 

approximately equal to: 

        Equation 2.2 

 

where h is the maximum run-up height in meters. 

Hataori (1979) extended the Imamura-Iida m scale to include far-field tsunami data, and considering the 

effect of distance. Another magnitude scale, Mt, called tsunami magnitude, was defined and assigned for 

many earthquakes by Abe (1979). The definition of Mt for a Trans-Pacific tsunami (Abe, 1979) is: 

               Equation 2.3 

 

and for a regional tsunami (100km&amp;lt;?&amp;lt;3500km) tsunami (Abe, 1981) is: 

                 Equation 2.4 

 

where H is the maximum amplitude recorded on tide gauges in meters, C is a distance factor depending on 

the location of the source and the observation points and ? is the actual travel distance in km. The empirical 

formulas above where calibrated for earthquakes with moment magnitude Mw 3. 

The above mentioned magnitude scales have focused in the more frequent earthquake generated 

tsunamis. However, although most tsunamis are triggered by earthquakes, it is unquestionably important to 

devote the necessary attention to tsunamis triggered by landslides or volcanic eruptions. In fact the largest 

ever recorded tsunami wave was observed in 1958 on a tsunami caused by a major submarine landslide 

(Aleutya Bay, Alaska, United States). Submarine landslides frequently occur in the aftermath of an 

earthquake (causing tsunamis much more localized than those from the earthquake itself, but at the same 

time potentially very destructive) (Bardet et al. 2003; Okal and Synolakis 2003). The fact that submarine 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

landslide tsunamis often have large run-up heights close to the source area but appear to propagate much 

less efficiently than earthquake tsunamis was exemplified by the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami, where 

run-up heights up to 15 m affected a 20 km segment of the coast (Dengler and Preuss 2003; McSaveney et 

al. 2000), while farther afield the tsunami was not a significant event (Okal and Synolakis 2004; Satake and 

Tanioka 2003). 

Volcanic triggered tsunamis present similar features. There are at least nine different mechanisms 

by which volcanoes produce tsunamis, including volcanic earthquakes, eruptions of undersea volcanoes, 

flow of pyroclastic masses into the sea, caldera collapse, debris avalanches and landslides, large lahars 

entering the sea, phreatomagmatic explosions, coupling between water and turbulent air waves travelling 

from an explosive eruption, and collapse of lava benches during effusive lava eruptions (Beget, 2000). In 

particular, volcanic tsunamis are typically generated within a very small geographic area on the flank of a 

volcano, and may even be modelled as a point source (Kienle et al., 1987). All evaluations of volcanic 

tsunami hazard should integrate both investigations of ancient volcanic tsunami deposits and studies of 

volcanic eruption history of island volcanoes and volcanoes located near coastal areas, to connect records 

of volcanic activity with the much more fragmentary geologic record of past tsunamis. Paris et al. (2011a) 

acknowledged that tsunamis generated by volcano flank failures represent a very low frequency but very 

high magnitude hazard. These volcano-gravitational events involving tens to hundreds of km³ are evidenced 

by voluminous submarine debris, such as in the Hawaiian Islands (Moore et al., 1989; Normark et al., 1993; 

McMurtry et al., 2004), Reunion Island (Oehler et al., 2004), Canary Islands (Krastel et al., 2001; Masson et 

al., 2002; Paris et al., 2005) or the Cape Verde Islands (Masson et al., 2008; Madeira et al., 2011). 

Independently of the source mechanism, tsunami intensity scales can be established based on the 

effects in coastal areas. For tsunami intensity three different scales have been proposed. Soloviev (1970) 

pointed out that Imamura-Iida’s scale is more like an earthquake intensity scale rather than a magnitude. He 

also distinguished the maximum tsunami height (h) and the mean tsunami height along a stretch of coast 

(hr). He then defined tsunami intensity (i) as: 

           Equation 2.5 

 

The Sieberg intensity scale – a descriptive intensity scale based on the physical destruction caused by 

tunami waves (Ambraseys, 1962) - ranks tsunamis from light tsunamis (Level 1) to disastrous tsunamis 

(Level 6) by their impacts. Furthermore, Papadopoulos and Imamura (2001) proposed a new intensity scale 

based in the effect on humans and on objects (of different sizes and nature) and the damage caused to 

buildings. This new scale varies from level I (Not felt) to level XII (completely devastating).

2.2. Tsunami and storm deposits in the geological record 

The Holocene stratigraphy of a specific region reflects the group and succession of 

sedimentological processes that affected the area during time. These processes include intra-basinal, 

regional or global-scale mechanisms operating at different scales. In addition to the processes operating in 

permanence in a region, which prevail in the facies architecture and succession of the sedimentary record, 

catastrophic events such as tsunamis and storms can contribute significantly to the stratigraphy of any given 

area. In contrast to modern tsunami, for which eyewitness accounts and field measurements of both 

erosional and depositional effects are utilized in modelling studies, (palaeo)tsunami recognition depends on 

the identification of ancient tsunami deposits (e.g. Bourgeois et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Smit et al., 1992; 

Bondevik et al., 1997, Dawson and Stewart, 2007, Mahaney et al. 2010; Chagué-Goff et al., 2011). More 

recently, the term “tsunamiite” has also been used to describe onshore sedimentary deposits lay down by 

tsunami events (Shiki et al., 2008). Tsunami deposition is commonly characterized by the re-deposition of 

coarse shallow marine or coastal sediments in terrestrial and/or transitional (e.g. lagoonal, estuarine) 

environments. Recognition of these deposits is the primary method for reconstructing tsunami minimum 

inundation distance and run-up, although patterns of erosion and deposition by both landward- and seaward-

directed flows are complex, these patterns being further complicated by the existence of more than one 

wave associated with the same tsunami (Moore and Moore, 1984; Synolakis et al., 1995; Bondevik et al., 

1997; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Le Roux and Vargas, 2005; Paris et al., 2007), thus introducing uncertainties 

in those reconstructions. In particular, because the maximum altitude at which tsunami sediments are 

deposited in the coastal zone is nearly always lower than the height reached by the tsunami. In fact, the 

upper sediment limit is generally regarded as a minimum level reached by the tsunami waves (this 

assumption is of crucial importance for hazard and physical and numerical modelling because sediment 

evidence might underestimate the flooding penetration). 

The nature of tsunami deposits varies greatly with coastal and nearshore morphology, the height of 

tsunami waves at the coast and run-up, and with the nature and amount of existing sediment in any coastal 

setting when affected by such an event. Consequently, the possible variations in sedimentary processes and 

products during these complex events remains poorly understood but in general a tsunami deposit will only 

be produced if there is a suitable supply of sediment and accommodation space in the coastal zone. More 

recently, the subsequent backwash, or return flow, has been regarded as a process of significant 

geomorphic and sedimentologic consequences (e.g. Dawson, 1994; Dawson, 1999; Hindson and Andrade, 

1999; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Le Roux and Vargas, 2005; Paris et al., 2010b), though the spatial extension 

of the correspondent signature is usually more restricted due to channelling effects. The geomorphological 

consequences of tsunamis and storms in coastal dunes or barrier islands have also been addressed (e.g. 

Andrade, 1990; Andrade et al., 2004; Regnauld et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009; Dinis et al., 2010; Goff et 

al., 2010b).

Due to their specific physics and sediment transport processes tsunami and storms tend to leave 

their sediment imprint in a wide range of environments (e.g. alluvial plains, estuaries, coastal lagoons, 

embayments, nearshore and offshore areas) although storms usually present a smaller amount of inland 

penetration. However, many of these environments display a low preservation potential for event deposits 

(Einsele et al., 1996) and the recognition of tsunami and storm deposits is many times constrained by the 

poor preservation of those deposits (or absence) in the stratigraphic record. In many cases, the 

anthropogenic activity, the erosion characteristics of the event, the relative changes in sea level in a 

millennium timescale and the absence of lithological differentiation makes palaetsunami deposits difficult to 

identify and therefore also makes it difficult to make inferences regarding the return intervals of such events 

(Szczucinski, 2011; Yawsangratt et al., 2011). 

 

2.2.1. Nearshore and offshore deposits 

Nearshore and offshore deposits have been described essentially in association with several 

specific tsunami events worldwide (Smit et al., 1992; Cita et al., 1996; Fujiwara et al., 2000; van der Bergh et 

al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2005; Noda et al., 2007; Abrantes et al., 2008; Gracia et al., 

2010) and were considered by Dawson and Stewart (2008) a “very much neglected research area” within 

tsunami sedimentary recognition. Weiss and Bahlburg (2006) considered that offshore tsunami depositon in 

deep marine environments well below the wave base of severe storms are theoretically much more likely to 

preserve tsunami deposits than shallow settings. Despite of that fact, these authors noted that there are only 

a few descriptions in the literature of marine, and particularly subtidal, tsunami deposits (Pratt, 2001, 2002; 

Bussert and Aberhan 2004; Cantalamessa and Di Celma 2005; Schnyder et al. 2005). 

In the offshore area, the term “deep-sea homogenite” has been used to define a massive, poorly 

sorted, grain-supported unit that contains large reworked shallow-marine fossils and occasional large 

intraclasts that have been described in association with the Bronze Age Santorini tsunami event (Cita et al., 

1996). Other tsunamigenic deposits were discussed in an offshore sedimentary context and related with 

events such as the K/T meteoric tsunami (e.g. Smit et al., 1992; Albertão and Martins, 1996), the AD 1755 

tsunami (Terrinha et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2005 and 2008; Gracia et al., 2010), the 2003 Tokashioki 

earthquake (Noda et al., 2007) or to try and match earthquake-triggered turbidites with tsunamigenic events 

from the Saguenay (Eastern Canada) and Reloncavi (Chilean margin) (St Onge et al., 2012). In fact, another 

peculiar note in terms of offshore tsunami deposits is that some have been specifically attributed to 

processes of tsunami backwash and the generation of gravity-driven flows of turbid water from nearshore to 

deep water (e.g. Abrantes et al., 2008; Paris et al., 2007).

2.2.2. Onshore boulder deposits 

There are two main types of onshore sedimentary evidences associated with tsunami and storms: 

one consisting in deposits of large boulders and the other in the deposition of finer (typically sand-sized) 

sediments in coastal areas. The universally accepted scale of grain sizes of siliciclastic sediment is the 

Uden-Wentworth (Wentworth, 1922) scale that is composed of four basic groups: clay (&amp;lt;4µm), silt (4µm - 

63µm), sand (63µm - 2mm) and gravel (&gt; 2mm). The larger particles (i.e. pebbles, cobbles and boulders) 

were all included in the gravel group. To facilitate the classification of larger particles Blair and McPherson 

(1999) revised the Udden-Wentworth scale to describe in greater detail the size of boulders and other larger 

particles. The grain size of fine, medium, coarse, and very coarse boulders range from 25.6 to 51.2cm, 51.2 

to 102.4cm, 102.4 to 204.8cm, and 204.8 to 409.6cm, respectively. Larger rocks or megaclasts, include fine 

(4.1 to 8.2m) and medium (8.2 to 16.4m) blocks. 

The identification and differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits and their association with 

specific events is of crucial importance for hazard or risk studies. Boulder and finer deposits can provide 

clues to the identification of both types of events. In the case of larger particles, the differentiation is firstly 

based on the identification of boulders that have been transported inland or upward from or within the 

coastal zone, and against gravity. In some cases, these boulders appear simply overturned a few m inland 

from their original source area. The recognition of boulder deposits associated with both tsunami and storms 

has been intensely debated in the literature (e.g. Bryant et al., 1992; Young et al., 1996; Nott, 1997; Bryant 

and Nott, 2001; Noormets et al., 2002; Goff et al., 2004; Williams and Hall., 2004, Scheffers and Kelletat, 

2005; Goff et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2006; Bourrouilh-Le Jan et al., 2007; Goto et al., 2007; Scheffers and 

Scheffers, 2007; Kelletat, 2008; Paris et al., 2010b; Scheffers, 2008; Scheffers et al.,2008, Etienne and 

Paris, 2010; Fichaut and Suanez, 2010; Goto et al., 2010a; Goto et al., 2010b; Nandasena et al., 2011a). 

From the many examples in the literature a few deserve special notice because of their specific lithological, 

geological, geomorphological or oceanographic significance. 

In terms of boulder deposits there are many examples worldwide attributed to deposition by storms 

and tsunami (compiled by e.g. Sheffers and Kelletat, 2003; Scheffers, 2008). They range from over 10 cubic 

metres up to 1000m3 and, depending on the bulk rock density their mass can exceed 2000t (Scheffers and 

Kelletat, 2003). They have been found at various elevations from the intertidal zone to a few tens of meters 

above the present sea level. Shi et al. (1995) reported that hundreds of boulders were deposited as far as 

200m inland by the December 12, 1992 tsunami in Flores (Indonesia), especially in the area of Riangkroko 

where the run-up reached 26m. The deposition of boulders in association with tsunamigenic events were 

discussed essentially after the 1990’s (e.g. Paskoff 1991; Dawson 1994; Hindson and Andrade, 1999). For 

instance, Hindson and Andrade (1999) noted that at several locations on the Algarve coastline the AD 1755 

tsunami was associated with the deposition of both continuous and discontinuous sand sheets, some of 

which containing boulders. The individual boulders were frequently pitted and sculptured by bioerosion and 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

in hollows marine endolithic mollusca were found and used to indicate the marine provenance of the 

boulders. 

The imbrication of boulders (at certain altitudes and distances from the coastal edge), coupled with 

the presence of shell and debris inclusions, were used as a diagnostic criteria of tsunami deposits (Bryant 

and Nott, 2001). Hall et al. (2006) focused exclusively in storm wave impacts on boulders sitting at the top of 

cliffs in Aran and Shetland Islands (North Sea), and identified inverted boulders exclusively transported by 

storms. Saltation of these boulders during transport was implied by the presence of shatter marks on the 

upper limestone ramps on Aran (Williams and Hall, 2004) and by trails of impact marks and chipped edges 

visible on otherwise weathered and lichen-covered surfaces. Hansom et al. (2008) provide modelled 

solutions for the forces of wave impact and subsequent lift at those sites. According to Hall et al. (2006), the 

characteristics and distribution of cliff top storm deposits allows the definition of wave properties that could 

generate those boulder accumulations. According to these authors, cliff top storm deposits require full 

exposure to storm waves and limited nearshore attenuation. 

In the Portuguese coast, namely in the Cascais-Cabo Raso area, Scheffers and Kelletat (2005) 

described isolated boulders and boulder fields they argue to have been deposited by the AD 1755 tsunami. 

The authors also indicate to have observed observed signatures of run-up ca. 50m above mean sea level 

(msl) in vegetation scars. They associated those marks and boulder transport to older tsunamis (proposed 

as ca. 2400 BP and 6000 BP). Furthermore, Whelan and Kelletat (2005) also observed boulders in Cape 

Trafalgar (Spain) that they associated with the AD 1755 tsunami but could not identify any field evidence for 

older tsunamis. Oliveira et al. (2011) combined field, aerial photography and wave data to characterize 

quarrying and transportation of two megaclasts weighting 14 and 8t, sitting at present above +1.70m above 

msl in the upper shore platform of Praia das Maçãs (Portugal). Both megaclasts were sourced from the 

same limestone bed seaward from their present location, and were transported landward and upward 

(against gravity) for a short distance, and in one case the block was overturned. Through the use of aerial 

photographs the date of transport was constrained between 1965 and 1975. The wave regime affecting this 

coast between 1953 and 2011 indicated high-energy modal conditions and extreme storm waves reached 

maximum Hs of ~13 m in only one occasion, precisely 17th January 1973. 

Switzer and Burston (2010) stated that the imbrication, mixed lithology and sedimentary 

characteristics of boulder deposits at Little Beecroft Head and Greenfields Beach (Australia) provided 

compelling evidence for large-scale movement attributed to washover by single or multiple events. If the 

deposits were late-Holocene in age then a hypothesisc of higher Holocene sea level must be discarded and 

it is likely that storms and tsunami may have both played a role in the development of the high elevation 

boulder deposits. However, as in many other sites where boulder deposits transported against gravity have 

been found, it remains unclear which (i.e. tsunami or storms) was the exact mechanism of emplacement.

2.2.3. Onshore cobble and gravel deposits 

Different size-ranged clasts associated with tsunamis and storms are also described in the 

literature. In terms of cobble and peeble deposits (2-256mm diameter - Krumbein and Sloss, 1963) a few 

studies have been conducted over recent years. For example, Morton et al. (2008) analysed coastal gravel-

ridge complexes deposited either by tsunamis or hurricanes on islands in the Caribbean Sea. The ridge 

complexes of Bonaire, Jamaica, Puerto Rico (Isla de Mona) and Guadeloupe consisted of clasts ranging in 

size from sand to coarse boulders derived from the adjacent coral reefs or subjacent rock platforms. The 

authors observed that the ridge complexes were internally organized, displayed textural sorting and a broad 

range of ages indicative of several historical events. Some of the cobble deposits displayed seaward-dipping 

beds and ridge-and-swale topography, whereas other terminated in fans or steep avalanche slopes. 

Together, the morphologic, sedimentologic, lithostratigraphic, and chronostratigraphic evidence indicated 

that ridge complexes were not entirely the result of one or a few tsunamis as previously reported (e.g. 

Scheffers and Kelletat, 2003) but resulted from several events including not only tsunamigenic but also 

storm/hurricane events. Furthermore, in a nearby region (French West Indies) Caron (2011) used samples 

from beachrock and non-cemented coarse-grained coastal deposits and applied quantitative textural and 

taphonomic analysis to discriminate different depositional processes associated with storm and tsunami 

waves. 

Richmond et al. (2011) in the island of Hawaii identified three distinct coarse-clastic depositional 

assemblages that could be recognized based on clast size, composition, angularity, orientation, packing, 

elevation and inland distance of each accumulation. These deposits were characterized as: 

1) Gravel fields of isolated clasts, primarily boulder-sized, and scattered pockets of sand and gravel 

in topographic lows. 

2) Shore-parallel and cuspate ridges composed mostly of rounded basalt gravel and sand with 

small amounts of shell or other biogenic carbonate. The ridges ranged in height from about 1 to 3m. 

3) Cliff-top deposits of scattered angular and sub-angular (cobble and gravel) clasts along sea cliffs 

that were generally greater than 5m elevation. 

The authors concluded that the gravel fields were primarily of tsunami origin from either the 1975 

Kalapana event, or a combination of tsunamis during 1868 and 1975. The ridge deposits were presently 

active and sediment continues to be added during high wave events. The cliff-top deposits contained 

evidences of deposition by both tsunami and storm processes. 

Costa et al. (2011) observed spreads of cobbles and boulders (typically with an A-axis of ca. 0.30m 

but some with smaller dimensions) that extended several hundred meters inland and well beyond the 

present landward limit of storm activity in a low-lying area  of the Algarve (Portugal). The marine origin of the 

boulders was demonstrated by well-developed macro-bioerosion sculpturing and in situ skeletal remains of

endolithic shallow marine bivalves. The authors associated (using radiocarbon age-estimation of Petricola 

lithophaga whole shells) the transport of these boulders with the desctructive Lisbon tsunami of AD 1755. 

 

2.2.4. Onshore fine-grained deposits 

Most studied tsunami imprints in coastal stratigraphy are  coarser sand-sized layers within low 

energy finer materials accumulated in depositional basins and exhibiting a distinctive sedimentological 

signature within the stratigraphic column (e.g. Atwater, 1987; Dawson et al., 1988; Atwater and Moore, 1992; 

Clague et al., 1994; Dawson et al., 1995; Shi et al., 1995; Hindson et al., 1996; Bondevik et al., 1997; 

Minoura et al., 1997; Goff et al., 2000; Nanayama et al., 2000; Chagué-Goff et al., 2002; Nanayama et al., 

2007; Moore et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009). This type of depositional arrangement is 

indicative of extreme marine inundations because they provide a stratigraphic context and facilitate accurate 

spotting and dating of individual events. Fine tsunami or storm deposits are typically sand-sized with a 

clearly-defined clay/silt fraction (e.g. Ota et al., 1985; Srinivasalu et al., 2007). The differentiation of tsunami 

events in a clayish stratigraphy was succefully attempted by Andrade et al. (2003) in the Tagus estuary. The 

combine used of sedimentological, magnetic susceptibility, micropaleontological and chronological data 

allowed the identification of historical tsunamis that affected the studied areas. 

The identification and differentiation of finer units deposited by tsunami or storms in coastal 

stratigraphy requires a multi-proxy approach that mainly focuses on the allochthonous sediment and/or 

palaeontological content in order to establish a marine or coastal provenance. Tsunami or storm- 

transported sediment is typically deposited during run-up, even though deposition also occurs during 

backwash and in the period of time between run-up and backwash, usually correspondent to a slack where 

currents fall to minimum intensity and the directional pattern is ill-defined. Furthermore, in some situations 

the erosional capacity of run-up or the backwash constrains the sedimentary recognition of events by 

removing sediments deposited by earlier tsunami waves. (See sections 2.3 and 2.4). 

 

2.2.5. Hydrodynamic models of transport of fines, gravel and boulders 

Field measurements are extremely useful but are somewhat constrained to local experimental 

specificities, thus limiting interpretations. To overcome this restriction various numerical and physical 

modelling exercises have been done in order to shed further light on the properties of tsunami and storm 

waves, as well as, elucidate on the type/size of material that different events are capable of transporting and 

also in the establishment of patterns of fine-grained sedimentation, aiming at developing criteria allowing 

differentiation between extreme marine inundations. 

In order to distinguish the transport mechanisms associated with tsunami and storms several hydrodynamic 

and numerical models have been proposed (e.g. Nott, 1997; Lorang, 2000; Felton, 2002; Nott, 2003; 

Noormets et al., 2004; Jaffe and Gelfenbaum, 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2007; Scicchitano et 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

18 
 

al., 2007; Tappin, 2007; Hansom et al., 2008; Imamura et al., 2008; Weiss, 2008; Lavigne et al., 2009; Paris 

et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2010b; Spiske et al., 2010; Switzer and Burston, 2010; Apotsos et al., 2011; Jaffe et 

al., 2011; Nandasena et al., 2011a,b). The most cited numerical approach to the differentiation of tsunami 

and storm transport mechanisms was proposed by Nott (1997, 2003) and is based in the estimation of 

threshold conditions for initiation of boulders movement under wave action. Nott (1997, 2003) presented a 

set of equations relating the forces involved in the transport of submerged, sub-aerial and joint-bounded 

boulders in coastal areas. 

Noormets et al. (2004) determined the hydrodynamic forces acting on a low submerged shoreline 

cliff (in Hawaii) computing wave characteristics based on linear wave theory and experimental results taking 

into account he local wave climate and near-shore bottom topography. Their analyses showed that tsunami, 

as well as large swell waves, are capable of quarrying megaclasts, provided that sufficient initial fracturing is 

present. Dislodgement and emplacement most likely occurs in a sequence during impact of a single wave on 

a coastal cliff. Swell waves however seem to be capable of emplacing large blocks onto the platform due to 

their rapid disintegration after breaking. They determined that sliding was the most common mechanism of 

transport for larger and irregular megaclasts, whereas somewhat smaller and platy megaclasts where 

occasionally found in overturned positions. Inverse models of flow from tsunami deposits (Tappin, 2007) and 

forward models of deposits from flow (Gelfenbaum et al., 2007) are relatively new and still under 

development. These models make use of the dependence of sediment transport on the relationship between 

grain size (grain settling velocity) and flow shear stress. Deposition occurs where sediment transport 

converges or when deceleration permits sediment to fall out of suspension. 

Jaffe and Gelfenbaum (2007) proposed a tsunami sedimentation model based on the analysis of 

sand-sized sediment. These authors used the thickness of of tsunami deposits and mean grain particle size 

to reconstruct surface flow velocities. Scicchitano et al. (2007) reanalysed the equations proposed by Nott 

(2003) using a hydrodynamic approach to determine whether tsunami- or storm-generated waves were 

responsible for coastal boulder deposition in places of the southern coast of Italy. Their results suggested 

that tsunamis were responsible for the detachment and transport of the largest blocks. However, they could 

not exclude that storm waves could also have been responsible for the movement and/or re-orientation of 

smaller-sized blocks, possibly carved out and transported during previous tsunami events. Their analysis 

also confirmed the importance of the pre-transport setting of boulders in determining the height and velocity 

of the wave required for boulders to be transported. 

Pritchard and Dickinson (2008) described a mathematical model of suspended and bedload 

sediment transport under long, non-breaking waves running over a plane beach, and used this model to 

investigate the relationship between the hydrodynamics of swash nd backwash and the resulting erosive and 

depositional processes. They found that sediment transport, both as bedload and  suspended is strongly 

controlled by asymmetries in the direction of maximum velocity; in the latter case (suspension) transport is 

also affected by settling lag, especially around the point of maximum run-up. The authors concluded that 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

19 
 

combination of these effects appears to preclude simple methods of reconstructing tsunami hydrodynamics. 

Using a similar approach, Weiss (2008) computed the water depth where a passing tsunami wave is able to 

move grains, and estimated the grain size that can be moved at a certain water depth on a sloping beach by 

a shoaling tsunami wave. According to Weiss (2008), tsunami waves generated by submarine slides or 

meteoritic impacts, unlike those generated by offshore earthquakes, could produce waves with the required 

larger amplitudes. Tsunamis generated by submarine landslides often have very large run-up heights close 

to the landslide area, but have more limited far-field effects than earthquake tsunamis (Okal and Synolakis, 

2004). 

Imamura et al. (2008) conducted hydraulic experiments in an open channel with cubic and 

rectangular shaped solid blocks to investigate boulder transport by tsunamis and developed a model 

(introducing an empirical variable coefficient of friction) that takes into account the various transport modes 

(i.e. rolling, saltation, sliding). The authors noted that the blocks were mainly transported by a bore, 

predominantly by rolling or saltation rather than by sliding. Imamura et al. (2008), also stated that previous 

models of boulder transport by tsunamis probably underestimated the distance the boulder travelled by 

influence of tsunami waves when they were transported by rolling or saltation. The model was tested using 

boulders from Inoda (Japan) which were transported by the 1771 Meiwa tsunami. The calculated distance of 

transport of the boulder was approximately 650m, which was consistent with the description in the historical 

documents. 

On the other hand, Paris et al. (2009) analysing the effects of the Indian Ocean Tsunami (24th 

December 2004) in Lhok Nga (Indonesia) observed that large tsunami waves (25–30m high) were able to 

detach and transport coral boulders in excess of 10t over 500–700m and megaclasts of the rocky platform in 

excess of 85t over a few metres. However, the authors did not observe any landward fining trend in the 

boulder size distribution. The spatial and size distributions of tsunami boulder deposits are mostly depended 

on the location and characteristics of their source (coral reef, beach rock, platform, dams), together with 

clast and surface interference during transport. Density also plays an important role in boulder transport, for 

example, a less dense coral boulder buoyed up on water can be more easily transported inland than a more 

dense granitic boulder. Furthermore, Spiske et al. (2008) investigated the role of porosity on boulder 

transport and elucidated the distinction between tsunami and hurricane impacts, by performing Archimedean 

and optical 3D-profilometry measurements for the determination of accurate physical parameters for porous 

reef and coral limestone boulders from the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles). 

The authors concluded that the calculated wave heights, the high frequency of tropical storms and 

hurricanes in the southern Caribbean and the occurrence of boulders exclusively on the windward sides of 

the islands, implicate that the boulders on those islands are more likely to be hurricane originated. More 

recent work on reefs indicate however that boulder size can also be used to estimate the wave current 

velocities generated in storms and tsunamis (Paris et al., 2009; Goto, 2010b). 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

20 
 

The transport mode of boulders from Jervis Bay (Australia) was discussed by Goff et al. (2010b). 

The authors conclude that a better understanding of the critical thresholds for the bed load transport of 

boulders is necessary. This issue was addressed for instance by Benner et al. (2010) that discussed 

physical modelling of tsunami and storms boulder transport debating shortfalls in calculations from previous 

published work. Lorang (2010) provided a simple wave-competence approach to determining the likelihood 

of one causal mechanism over the other by solving a system of equations to determine wave period in order 

to differentiate between tsunamis from wind-generated waves. Lorang (2010) revisited Nott’s equations and 

also used the Hudson formula (United States Army Corps of Engineers, 1984) to estimate wave height for 

the potential wave based on size of the boulder or megaclast. Combining that information with the elevation 

above the initial position and the total horizontal distance of transport, density of the megaclast and assumed 

values of several coefficients it was possible to estimate the wave period. Furthermore, Apotsos et al. (2011) 

proposed a numerical model based on non-linear shallow water equations developed for periodic long 

waves inundating over planar slopes. Simulations were conducted to examine the effects on maximum 

tsunami run-up and water velocity of variations in wave characteristics, bed slopes and bottom roughness.  

Nandasena et al. (2011a) revised Nott's equations in the sub-aerial and joint-bounded boulder 

scenarios and corrected their approach for lift and inertia and incorporated an additional description of the 

pre-transport location and effects of bottom slope. Calculations were performed in boulders described in 

published accounts and a boulder transport histogram introduced to represent the range of flow velocityies 

that satisfy the requirements for initial transport of a boulder in different modes: sliding, rolling, and saltation. 

The theoretical results were successfully compared to field data. Moreover, Nandasena et al. (2011b) 

discussed the relevance of clast-to-clast interactions and its impact in transport distance and dissipating the 

energy. The authors concluded that numerical results revealed that drag and friction are the dominant forces 

applied to boulders during transport, and therefore, accurate estimation of drag and friction coefficients is 

also important for validation of any transport model. The difference between the simulated results and field 

observations was partly attributed to limitations of the numerical model such as inability to account for 

boulder shape, pre-transport environment, microtopographical variation, transport mode, and inaccurate 

definition of coefficients. 

Li and Huang (2011) used three laboratory-based measurements and results from one field survey 

following the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami to evaluate the performance of six widely-used sediment transport 

formulae (Bagnold; Van Rijn; A-W; Bijker; E-H and Yang) in modelling shoreline change due to tsunamis. 

The performance of these formulae proved to be inconsistent at low and high velocities with none giving 

reliable predictions matching both the low and high sediment transport rates observed. 

 

2.3. Sedimentological features of onshore tsunami deposits 

In this sub-chapter, the criteria used to recognize and differentiate tsunami deposits consisting of 

the finer fraction (i.e. typically sand) is presented. These features/criteria reflect the characteristics of 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

tsunami waves, transport peculiarities, preservation potential and sedimentary sources. The first studies to 

use geological record to detect prehistoric tsunamis were conducted by Atwater (1987) and Dawson et al. 

(1988). Since then many papers have been published discussing several aspects concerning features 

associated with tsunami deposits. The study of modern deposits carried out during immediate post tsunami 

surveys provided the opportunity to refine palaeotsunami diagnostic criteria, without the uncertainty of the 

generating event and preservation issues due to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Understandably, 

the number of studies on tsunami sedimentation increased exponentially since the 2004 Indian Ocean event, 

but care should be taken in adopting as of unquestionable universal applicability inferences derived from 

research on this particular event. Typically, tsunamis can leave sedimentary imprints on shores far from the 

event source, and usually less than a kilometre from the coastline (Dawson and Shi, 2000; Dominey-Howes 

et al., 2006). Tsunami deposits are usually thicker in topographic lows (areas of spatial deceleration of flows) 

and thin over topographic highs (areas of spatial acceleration of flows) (Gelfenbaum et al., 2007). In fact 

tsunami sediments can also be eroded during phases of backwash and have also been linked to new 

phases of sedimentation during backwash. The preservation of tsunami deposit is a fundamental factor in 

any sedimentological study focusing in recurrence intervals of such events. 

Tappin (2007) discussed sedimentary features associated with tsunami, stressing that the 

development of realistic scenarios of risk requires reliable data on tsunami frequency, which is obviously 

constrained by the sporadic absence of deposit, to which we could add the eventual unability to recognize a 

particular tsunami-deposited layer as such in a given sedimentary sequence. In fact, Szczucinski (2011) 

conducted 5 yearly surveys after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and concluded that the post-tsunami 

recovery of coastal zones was generally in the order of a few months to a few years. The study by Nichol 

and Kench (2008) in the Maldives found that within 2 years, significant reworking and bioturbation of the 

tsunami deposit occurred. The major macroscopic change observed was the fast removal of the thin layer of 

very fine sediments usually representing the top of the tsunami deposits, though such a thin layer consisting 

of very fine-grained material has not been reported as ubiquitous in other places worldwide and surveyed 

shortly after tsunami inundations. Szczucinski (2011) observed that almost all the near-surface structures of 

the tsunami deposits were removed with time (i.e. after at least 1 rainy season). Tsunami deposits thinner 

than 10cm usually acquired a massive appearance after 1 or 2 years; the only remnants of the primary 

structures, for instance fining upward, having vanished out. This was attributed to bioturbation by growing 

roots and burrowing animals like crabs and rodents. A few years earlier Szczucinski et al. (2007) detected 

that tsunami deposits thinner than 1cm were occasionally washed away, the depositional relief was flattened 

and deposits at the slopes were partially eroded; and yet, in other locations, the sedimentary bodies, 

including thin sand laminae, and sedimentary structures, such as lamination and size grading, persisted at 

century-long timescales (e.g. Washington State, Boca do Rio, Martinhal) following deposition. According to 

Yawsangratt et al. (2011) micropalaeontological evidences (i.e. carbonate foraminifera) may be subjected to 

significant dissolution 4.5 years after tsunami emplacement; again, this post depositional disturbance is not

exclusive of tsunami deposits and rapid intrasediment dissolution or downwearing of carbonate foraminifera 

tests, ostracoda valves or diatom frustules is a common drawback micropaleontologists working in Holocene 

sediments of various facies are used to and aware of, and not exclusive of high-energy events of abrupt 

marine inundation. In this context, it is somewhat surprising that  Lowe and de Lange (2000) suggested, 

based on a study from New Zealand, that a tsunami needs to raise a height of at least 5m in order to leave 

any long-term, recognisable sedimentary signature (cf. Goff et al., 2010a). This statement disregards the 

effect of sediment concentration in tsunami waves in determining the size and preservation potential of the 

depositional signature, just as a number of other relevant variables, such as the presence of a compatible 

source, accommodation space, rapid capping of the inundation deposit, among other, which are completely 

independent of the tsunami amplitude. 

During the last two decades, several authors (e.g. Shi and Dawson, 1995; Goff et al., 1998; 

Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Dawson and Stewart, 2007; Huntington et al., 2007; Shiki et al., 2008; Switzer 

and Jones, 2008; Chagué-Goff et al., 2011) have postulated criteria to distinguish (palaeo)tsunami deposits. 

These are described below and summarized in Table 2.2. Dawson and Stewart (2007) discussed the 

processes of tsunami deposition, identifying the three main aspects that make the depositional process 

unique, tsunami source, propagation and inundation. The establishment of source material has been widely 

used (e.g. Moore and Moore, 1986; Atwater and Moore, 1992; Dawson et al., 1996; Minoura et al., 1997; 

Bourgeois et al., 1999; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Switzer et al., 2005; 

Szczucinski et al., 2006; Babu et al., 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Dahanayake and 

Kulasena, 2008; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et al., 2008; Switzer and Jones, 2008 Jagodzinski et 

al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2009; Mahaney and Dohm, 2011) because it allows one to 

reconstruct the origin and pathway of former tsunami waves. However, it has been commonly reported that 

tsunami waves transport essentially sediment that is available in the coastal fringe landward of the boundary 

defined by the seasonal depth of closure of the beach (and coastal) profile (e.g. Atwater and Moore, 1992; 

Clague and Bobrowsky, 1994; Dawson 1994; Moore et al. 1994; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson, 2004; 

Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2010b; Goff et al., 2010a; Costa et al., 

2012a,b). In contrast with this, micropalaeontological evidences have indicated either relevant changes in 

the population of Nannoplankton, Foraminifera, Diatoms and Ostracods or that marine species from 

offshore/nearshore have been transported inland and deposited by tsunami (e.g. Hemphill-Haley, 1996; 

Hindson et al., 1996; Patterson and Fowler, 1996; Shennan et al. 1996; Clague et al., 1999; Dominey-

Howes et al., 2000; Chagué-Goff et al., 2002; Dawson and Smith, 2002; Abrantes et al., 2005; Dawson, 

2007; Horton et al 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Mamo et al., 2009; Sawai et al., 2009; Paris et al., 

2010a; Ruiz et al., 2010). Although a site-specific component might be a central feature of any tsunami 

deposits some generalizations are possible interrelated with sedimentary structures, sediment source, 

palaeontological, geochemical and geomorphological signatures (Table 2.2). 

 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

23 
 

2.3.1. Sedimentary structures 

In terms of sedimentological structures, an erosive/sharp/abrupt basal contact is a common feature 

and is symptomatic of the energy involved in the emplacement of tsunami deposits. However, this criterion 

was also recognized in storm deposits (Switzer, 2008). The sharp/abrupt/erosive contact of tsunamigenic 

layers were firstly described by Dawson et al. (1988), Moore and Moore (1988) and Minoura and Nakaya 

(1991). Bondevik et al. (1997), analysing evidences lay down by the Storegga tsunami in Norway, detected 

that the tsunami deposit rest on an erosional unconformity which in cases has removed more than 1 m of 

underlying sediment. Moreover, Nanayama et al. (2000) observed deposits that resulted from the 1993 

Hokkaido-nansei-oki (Japan) tsunami and identified distinctive sharp erosional bases in the tsunamigenic 

unit. Gelfenbaum and Jaffe (2003) analysed the erosion and sedimentation associated with the 1998 Papua 

New Guinea tsunami and observed that the beach face and berm showed no evidence of deposition from 

the tsunami. However, on the berm, exposed roots and scour at the base of some palm trees indicated 

erosion of approx. 20-30cm of backbeach sand and they observed that only erosional signatures had been 

left by this tsunami to the landward side of the berm, up to about 50m from the shoreline. Chandrasekar 

(2005) described erosion of up to 2m over large tracts of beach associated with the return flow of the 2004 

Indian Ocean tsunami. In Thailand, Szczucinski et al. (2005) and (2006), Hori et al. (2007) and Fujino et al. 

(2009) observed an erosive sharp basal contact between the tsunamigenic and the underlying layers. 

Choowong et al. (2009) also noted that during the same event, erosion and deposition occurred mainly 

during two periods of inflow and that the return flow was mainly erosive. Paris et al. (2009) described erosion 

associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Banda Aceh (Indonesia) that extended up to 500m 

inland. These authors quantified the overall coastal retreat from Lampuuk to Leupung as of the order of 60m 

(ca. 550,000 m2) and locally in excess of 150m. The erosional impact of tsunamis is still controversial, not 

only the recognition of associated patterns in the sedimentary record, other than the erosive base and 

quantification of the amount of sediment removed but also the mechanisms and processes associated and 

responsible for the erosional/depositional balance during a tsunami. In fact, Bahlburg and Spiske (2011) 

analysing the sedimentary record of the February 2010 tsunami at Isla Mocha (Chile) observed that the 

tsunamigenic unit was produced essentially (i.e. &gt;90%) by the backflow. These authors suggest that due to 

the lack of sedimentary structures, many previous studies of modern tsunami sediments assumed that most 

of the detritus were deposited during inflow and an uncritical use of this assumption may lead to erroneous 

interpretations of palaeotsunami magnitudes and sedimentary processes if unknowingly applied to backflow 

deposits. Typically tsunami deposits present sediment size that can vary from mud to boulders and, in many 

cases, grain-size variation in tsunami deposits is controlled by the size of sediment available for transport, 

rather than by flow capacity (Bourgeois, 2009) or direction. 

The detection of sedimentary structures is limited by sampling methods because coring (which is 

frequently used), in contrast to trench excavation, is in general destructive. Sedimentary structures are also 

difficult to identify in tsunami deposits due to the common deposition as massive deposit (e.g. Dawson et al., 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

24 
 

1995; Dahanayake and Kulasena, 2008). However, there has been several tsunami deposits where 

sedimentary structures including laminae (e.g. Reinhart, 1991; Bondevik, 2003), rip-up clasts (e.g. Dawson, 

1994; Shi et al., 1995; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Bondevik et al., 2003; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Goff 

et al., 2004; Morton et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009), cross-stratification (e.g. Choowong et al., 2008) and soft-

sediment deformation (Matsumoto et al., 2008) have been observed. Muddy laminae or organic layers can 

represent evidence for multiple waves of the tsunami wave train (e.g. Reinhart, 1991; Bondevik 2003). 

Furthermore, loading structures at the base of the deposit have been reported in literature (e.g. Dawson et 

al., 1991; Minoura and Nakaya, 1991; Costa, 2006; Dominey-Howes, 2007; Martin and Bourgeois, 2012). 

Another peculiar feature observed in many tsunamigenic deposits worldwide is the enrichment in 

bioclasts or shells (many of them broken) when compared with the under and overlying layers (e.g. Moore 

and Moore, 1988; Bryant et al,. 1992; Albertão and Martins, 1996; Imamura et al., 1997; Clague et al.,1999; 

Donato et al., 2008) and in cases platy or prolate shell fragments occur aligned suggesting a ghosty 

lamination (e.g. Dawson et al., 1995, Hindson et al, 1996, Hindson and Andrade, 1999). For example, 

Clague and Bobrowsky (1994) observed that tsunami sand deposits commonly include fragments of bark, 

twigs, branches, logs and other plant material. Moreover, Donato et al. (2008) showed that shell features 

could be used as useful indicators of tsunamigenic deposit due to their vertical and lateral extent, to the 

allochthonous mixing of articulated bivalve species (e.g. lagoonal and nearshore) out of life position, and to 

the high amount of fragmented valves, with angular breaks and stress fractures. The authors suggested that 

the taphonomic uniqueness of tsunami deposits should be considered as a valid tool for tsunamigenic 

recognition in the geological record. 

The sedimentological fingerprint of currents associated with tsunami events have also been 

observed in the form of parallel lamination, cross-lamination, convolutions and ripple-marks (e.g. Shiki et al., 

2008). Moreover, Morton et al. (2007) detected palaeocurrent indicators in tsunami deposits indicating 

seaward return flow. In deposits laid down by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, in Thailand, Choowong et al. 

(2008) observed capping bedforms and parallel laminae, cross-lamination, rip-up mud and sand clasts. The 

authors also observed normal grading but some reverse grading was locally recognized. According to 

Choowong et al. (2008) reverse grading in tsunami deposits indicates a very high grain concentration within 

the tsunami flow, and was possibly formed at the initial stages of inundation in shallow water. Cross-bedding 

was seen as restricted to return-flow sediments (Nanayama et al., 2000). Individual deposits are generally 

well sorted (many are massive) and characterised by sets of fining-upwards sediment sequences that were 

interpreted by Shi (1995) as indicative of deposition by individual tsunami waves. Dawson and Smith (2000) 

characterised a tsunami sequence in Scotland by several fining upward sequences indicative of a series of 

tsunami waves and episodes of backwash. Furthermore, run-up and return flow deposits were also 

differentiated by Dawson et al., (1996), Nanayama et al., (2000) and Goff et al.,(2001). In the case of the 

Indian Ocean tsunami, Paris et al. (2007) observed a landward sequence thinning, fining and sorting. 

Normally-graded couplets or triplets of layers were used to identify the run-up of each wave. The topmost 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

25 
 

layers, interpreted as the backwash deposition, describe a seaward sequence of decreasing mean grain-

size. 

The time lag separating tsunami wave-trains is occasionally marked between different sub-units by 

the presence of mud drapes. Moreover, Fujiwara and Kamataki (2007) observed the presence of a vertical 

stack of many coarse-grained sub-layers separated by mud drapes interpreted as due to incremental 

deposition from multiple sediment flows separated by flow velocity stagnation stages and concluded that it is 

unlikely that the mud drapes were deposited by short-period storm waves. 

More recently, different techniques have been explored to identify the sedimentary structures in 

tsunami deposits. An example of this is ground penetrating radar, used by Switzer et al. (2006) to survey the 

erosional contact between an event layer and the under and overlying units. Koster et al., (2011) also used 

ground penetrating radar in combination with electrical resistivity tomography measurements and 

sedimentology for tsunamiite recognition in Greece and Spain. According to these authors, ground 

penetrating radar data indicated unconformable thicknesses of tsunamigenic beddings, channel-like 

structures (backwash deposits) and to some extent basal erosion, as well as abrasion-scours in various 

places, and boulder accumulation inside the deposits (see Table 2.2.) 

 

2.3.2. Sedimentary sources 

Several authors have argued that tsunamis are frequently associated with the deposition of 

continuous and discontinuous sediment sheets across large areas of the coastal zone, provided that there is 

an adequate sediment supply (e.g., Dawson et al., 1996; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson and Shi, 2000). The 

decrease of energy associated with the run-in of tsunami inundations is evidenced in stratigraphic and 

sedimentary architecture by the fining inland and thinning inland and ramping upwards of tsunamigenic 

deposits. This is probably the most common feature/criteria to recognize tsunami events in the stratigraphy 

of any given coastal area mainly due to the settlement of the particles through the water column, related to a 

decrease of the turbulence of the flow, generally forming fining-upward depositional sequences. Grain size 

characteristics of the tsunami deposits reflect both the origin of the displaced sediment and hydrodynamic 

conditions of sedimentation (Sugawara et al., 2008), with normally graded sand layers related to the 

decrease of the hydrodynamic energy during sedimentation (e.g. Dawson et al., 1988, 1991; Shi et al., 1995; 

Minoura et al., 2000). Although not a frequent situation, each fining-upward sequence can be attributed to 

individual tsunami waves as referred to by Ota et al. (1985), Moore and Moore (1988), Clague and 

Bobrowsky (1994). In contrast, coarsening upwards sequences have also been recognized and were 

ascribed to the long duration time of the tsunami (Higman and Jaffe, 2005) or high-density flow, as cited 

above. The same authors stated that tsunamis with narrower source regions are more likely to deposit 

sediment that is normally graded than those with wider sources who produce more complex deposits. 

Although local topography plays a decisive role (e.g. Hori et al., 2007) the thickness and mean grain size of 

tsunami deposits generally decrease landwards (e.g. Shi et al., 1995; Hindson et al., 1996; Minoura et al., 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

26 
 

1997; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Goff et al., 2004; Paris et al., 2009). Landward 

coarsening deposits have also been exceptionally observed (e.g. Higman and Bourgeois, 2008). In fact, the 

sediment texture of tsunami deposits is mostly related to material available for transport in the coastal zone 

tsunami deposits can therefore vary immensely from location to location. Differences in the tsunami records 

preserved tend to reflect the unique character of each tsunami, and may be attributed to source differences, 

coastal configuration, tide level, and sediment supply. For example, tsunami sediment source has been 

attributed to beaches and berms (e.g. Sato et al., 1995; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003), aeolian grains (e.g. 

Switzer et al., 2006) or to the inner shelf (e.g. Switzer and Jones, 2008). 

The use of heavy minerals to establish provenance of tsunamigenic deposits has also  been 

investigated by several authors (e.g. Switzer et al., 2005; Bahlburg and Weiss, 2007; Szczucinski et al., 

2006; Babu et al., 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et 

al., 2008; Switzer and Jones, 2008). For example, Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) observed the presence of thin 

heavy-mineral concentrations at the base of individual sand layers inferred to have been laid down by 

different waves from the same event. Furthermore, Switzer and Jones (2008) identified a mixed heavy 

mineral assemblage characteristic of barrier sediments with a component of inner shelf material 

characterised by immature platy minerals in a tsunami deposit. Morton et al. (2008) observed that vertical 

textural trends showed an overall but non-systematic upward fining and upward thinning of depositional units 

with an upward increase in heavy mineral laminations at some locations. However, most of these studies 

were limited to one study area and also by local differences in source material. Jagodzinski et al. (2009) tried 

to compare tsunami deposits, beach sediments and pre-tsunami soils in Thailand. The difference between 

tsunami deposits and beach sediments and soils was reflected in differences in the respective proportions of 

mica and tourmaline. These differences were attributed to the mode of sediment transport and deposition 

with mica, due to its low density, being more abundant in the topmost part of the tsunami deposit. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of mainly quartz grains has also been used to establish the 

source material of tsunami deposits (e.g. Bruzzi and Prone, 2000; Dahanayake and Kulasena, 2008; Costa 

et al., 2009; Mahaney and Dohm, 2011). Bruzzi and Prone (2000) compared SEM microtextural signatures 

of quartz grains deposited by the AD 1755 tsunami (Boca do Rio, Portugal) and other quartz grains 

deposited by a storm in the Rhone delta (France) in November 1997. According to the authors, several 

features were associated with a specific event (e.g. tsunami) such as upturned plates, fractures and marks 

of considerable size. Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008) identified diagnostic criteria to distinguish tsunami 

sediments from storm-surge sediments in southern Sri Lanka noting that in tsunami sediments, reworked 

marine microfauna are abundant, quartz sand is not well rounded, and heavy minerals were rare, when 

compared with storm-surge sediments, although they do not explain the reasons underlying these 

differences. 

Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility has also been used to provenance studies of tsunamigenic 

deposits (e.g. Sugawara et al., 2008; Font et al., 2010; Wassmer et al., 2010) but the application of this 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

27 
 

technique is still in its early days and always require that the data produced is normalised in respect of the 

grain size distribution. One example of these studies was conducted by Font et al. (2010) in Boca do Rio 

(Portugal) where the magnetic data showed a dominance of paramagnetic minerals (quartz) mixed with 

lesser amount of ferromagnetic minerals, namely titanomagnetite and titanohematite both of a detrital origin 

and reworked from the underlying sedimentary units. Statistical analyses pointed to a scenario where the 

energy released by the tsunami wave was strong enough to overtop and erode sand from the littoral dune 

and mixed it with reworked materials from underlying layers from at least 1m in depth (see Table 2.2). 

 

2.3.3. Palaeontological signature 

Macrofossils and microfossils have been used to identify and interpret sedimentary units as 

tsunamigenic. To date, the use of palaeontological characteristics to recognise tsunami deposits has 

focused on diatoms, foraminifera, ostracods, nannoplankton, pollen, molluscs and plant fragments. Typically 

the palaeontological signature is characterized by marked changes in the population indicating the increase 

in abundance of marine to brackish fossils and/or the high-energy of the event (e.g. presence of broken 

shells, etc.). 

Diatoms have been widely used as a proxy to detect extreme marine inundations (e.g. Dawson et 

al., 1996 a,b; Hemphill-Haley, 1996; Chagué-Goff et al., 2002; Abrantes et al., 2005; Dawson, 2007; Nichol 

et al., 2008; Sawai et al., 2009). Generally, diatom assemblages in tsunami deposits are chaotic (mixture of 

freshwater and brackish–marine species), because tsunami crosses coastal and inland areas eroding, 

transporting and re-depositing freshwater taxa (Dawson et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2004). 

Dawson et al. (1996b) analysed the diatom assemblages contained within tsunami deposits in Scotland, 

related to the Second Storegga Slide and also associated with Grand Bank tsunami of 1929, and detected 

the presence of exceptionally large numbers of the species Paralia sulcata with most individuals exhibiting 

evidence of breakage. Normally, tsunami deposits are characterized by a high percentage of broken valves 

(e.g. more than 65%: Dawson et al., 1996b; more than 75%: Dawson, 2007, 90% of pinnate: Dawson and 

Smith, 2000; more than 60%: Sawai, 2002). This is in contrast with Sawai et al. (2009) who analysed 

diatoms in tsunami deposits from the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and concluded that the breakage of 

diatom valves was relatively low. Moreover, low breakage of diatoms in tsunami deposits has also been 

reported in the Pacific coast of Washington State and Puget Sound, USA (Hemphill-Haley, 1996), and 

considered to have resulted from rapid sedimentation. At first sight it may appear that large percentages of 

broken diatoms may be indicative of former tsunamis. However, this issue is made problematic since owing 

to the varying robustness of lenticular and circular diatoms, tests of some species are more able than others 

to withstand fracturing. 

In a study of tsunami sediments deposited by the Papua New Guinea tsunami of 1998, Dawson (2007) 

observed a contrast between the sedimentological/textural data suggesting that the beach shore-face, the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

28 
 

berm as well as the sand spit were the source of the tsunami deposit. However, the examination of the 

diatom content of the sand suggested that the majority of diatoms were originated from the area immediately 

offshore. Benthic marine-brackish species (e.g. Surirella sp., Cocconeis scutellum and Diploneis smithii) 

were dominant within the tsunami sands along the length of transect including the sample furthest inland. 

Moreover, in one sample located 200m inland, the presence of the fully marine Triceriatum favus attests to 

the allochthonous (transported) nature of the species within the deposit. 

Sawai et al. (2009) analysed the diatom assemblages of Phra Thong's (Thailand) 2004 tsunami deposit and 

concluded that it contained surprisingly few freshwater specimens considered to have been a result of strong 

currents of the tsunami. Turbulent tsunami currents can cause rapid entrainment of a mixture of freshwater 

species, eroded soil and benthic marine species within a mass of coastal sand. However, if the currents are 

very strong, only benthic marine diatoms attached to heavier sandy substrate are able to settle out of the 

water column. When current velocity slows, the suspended freshwater specimens and soil fractions are able 

to settle out of the water column and deposit on top of the sandy, marine diatom-dominated portion of the 

deposit. 

Foraminiferal content is also a common micropalaeontological proxy that has been used in tsunami 

sediment provenance studies  (e.g. Hindson et al., 1996; Patterson and Fowler, 1996; Shennan et al., 1996; 

Andrade et al., 1997; Dominey-Howes et al., 1998; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Clague et al., 1999; 

Hawkes et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Mamo et al., 2009). Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) 

observed in Kenya that the samples contained abundant tests of benthic foraminifera (Quinqueloculina and 

Spiroloculina) typically derived from shallow and protected shelf regions in water depth of less than 30m). 

Also present were several species of Amphistegina sp. including Amphistegina lessonii d’Orbigny which may 

occur down to water depths of 80 m. The foraminifera content indicated that the tsunami very likely entrained 

most of the sediment in shallow depths of less than 30m. Hawkes et al. (2007) analysed tsunami deposits in 

Malaysia and Thailand, and observed that the pre-tsunami assemblages were mainly composed of intertidal 

and inner shelf species (i.e. Ammonia spp., Elphidium hispudula) while the tsunami sediment also contained 

a minor but important addition of mangrove species, such as Haplophragmoides. wilberti and 

Haplophragmoides manilaensis and some radiolarian species. According to the authors, the mangrove and 

radiolarian species reflected the chaotic nature of deposition where swash up and backwash combine to 

create turbulence, mixing the assemblages together. Foraminiferal assemblages within tsunami sediments 

were also able to provide information about sediment provenance and wave characteristics. In one location 

(Sungai Burong), species assemblages in the tsunami sediment revealed at least two separate episodes of 

deposition that contained inrushed species from the inner-shelf, as well as backwash species from the 

mangrove environment. In the study by Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008), also on the 2004 Indian Ocean 

tsunami, more abundant planktonic species such as Globigerinita glutinata, Hantkenina sp. and also benthic 

Quinqueloculina sp. as well as Amphistegina lessonii D’Orbigny were detected. Kortekaas and Dawson 

(2007) analysing a tsunami deposit in Martinhal (Portugal) noted a clear abrupt change from the brackish 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

29 
 

foraminifera assemblage of the underlying layer to a fully marine assemblage consisting of Elphidium 

macellum, Elphidium crispum, Quinqueloculina seminulum, Cibicides refulgens, Eponides repandus and 

Ammonia beccarii var. batavus. 

More recently, Mamo et al. (2009) summarized the many procedures, characteristics and limitations 

associated with foraminiferal assemblages and their use in the recognition of tsunami deposits. 

Characteristics such as changes in assemblage composition (Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, 

1999; Hawkes et al., 2007), for example, marine shelf species within a lagoon or brackish environment; 

changes in test size or in juvenile to adult ratios (Guilbault et al., 1996); a shift in population numbers (Cundy 

et al., 2000; Hawkes et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007); or a change in the taphonomic character of 

the tests (Hindson et al., 1999; Hawkes et al., 2007) can be used to recognise tsunami deposits. Given that 

the exact composition of an assemblage varies from location to location, it is impossible to expect to see a 

specific diagnostic specie(s) or assemblage in association with tsunami-deposited sediments. Some authors 

(Dominey-Howes et al., 1998; Nanayama and Shigeno, 2006; Uchida et al., 2007) suggested that given 

ideal conditions a tsunami deposit might contain deeper water species that would not otherwise be expected 

from the shallow water. 

Ostracods have also been used as tsunami indicators (e.g. Ruiz et al, 2010; Mischke et al., 2010). 

For example, Mischke et al. (2010) analysed a tsunami deposit in Lake Hersek (Turkey) and suggested that 

the simultaneous occurrence of ostracods of different origin (lagoonal: Cyprideis. torosa and Loxoconcha 

elliptica; shallow marine: Loxoconcha rhomboidea, Xestoleberis sp., Pontocythere sp. and Aurila cf. 

arborescens; and inland waters: Heterocypris salina and Eucyprinotus cf. rostratus) within beds of brackish-

marine mollusc shells and fragments indicates that the shell layers were deposited under high-energy 

environmental conditions (Ruiz et al., 2010). In the case of Lake Manyas (140 km west of Lake Hersek), 

ostracods of different origins were also interpreted as reflecting an event of large amplitude (seiche) (Leroy 

et al., 2002). In Hersek, the use of ostracods as tsunami indicators was argued on the basis of: (1) the large 

number of ostracod shells accumulated during the high-energy events, (2) the higher number of taxa which 

is not typical for an undisturbed lagoon setting, and (3) the mixture of ostracod valves with clear marine, 

lagoonal and non-marine origin. 

Changes in Nannoplankton have also been discussed in association with tsunami deposits (e.g. 

Andrade et al., 2003; Paris et al., 2010a). Andrade et al. (2003) observed within the clay/sitl fraction changes 

in samples from the Tagus estuary (Portugal) subtle variations (i.e. increases) in calcareous nannoplankton 

that were correlated with magnetic susceptibility, foraminifera and geochemical changes. Paris et al. (2010a) 

observed that a characteristic of the Lhok Nga (Indonesia) tsunamigenic sediments is their nannolith coastal 

assemblages despite their relative impoverishment in clay content, which under normal marine 

hydrodynamic conditions would prevent nannoliths to settle. The abundance of nannoliths in the 2004 

tsunami deposits tends to decrease landward and upward, despite variations due to successive phases of 

erosion/sedimentation by waves (see Table 2.2).

2.3.4. Geochemical signature 

Several studies were conducted in tsunami deposits with the aim of identifying a distinctive 

geochemical signature (e.g. Minoura and Nakaya, 1991; Minoura et al., 1994; Andrade et al., 1998; Goff and 

Chague-Goff, 1999; Chagué-Goff et al., 2002, Andrade et al., 2003; Goff et al., 2004; Srinivasalu et al., 

2007; Chagué-Goff, 2011). Usually geochemical features of tsunami deposits simply indicate the presence 

of saltwater inundation and thus do not provide information on the specific type of inundation. In fact, 

increases in the concentration of chemical elements of marine origin or elements indicative of coarser-sized 

sediments have been recognised in the past as a proxy in the study of extreme marine inundations. Newson 

(1979) detected increases in the concentration of some elements which was interpreted as evidence of 

marine originated sediment (Ca) and water (Na, Mg, Cl, SO4, K) influx. A similar trend was observed by 

Minoura and Nakaya (1991) that also detected increases in Na, Ca, K, Mg and Cl. This was further 

supported by increases in Cl, Na, Ca, SO4 and Mg observed by Minoura et al. (1994). Andrade and Hindson 

(1999) were able to detect increases in SiO2 (indicating increase in sand material) CaO (indicating a larger 

presence of bioclasts), Cr, MgO, I and Cl (all indicating a marine water influx). On the other hand, increase in 

Fe and S and dilution of anthropogenic elements were observed by Goff and Chagué-Goff (1999) which 

suggested a sudden marine inundation. Van der Bergh et al. (2003) observed the presence of exotic 

sediments derived from outer coastal or continental shelf environments that were richer in heavy metals (Pb, 

Cu, Ni, Fe and Cr) when compared with in-situ sediments. A similar pattern was observed by Szczucinski et 

al. (2005) who studied sediments, deposited by the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, and noticed that they 

contained significantly elevated contents of salts (Na+, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2, Cl and SO4) in water-soluble fraction, 

and of Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and As. 

Andrade et al. (2003) observed in the Tagus estuary (Portugal) in association with major compositional 

breaks increases in the ratios of SiO2/Al2O3 and CaO/Al2O3 both accompanying increasing carbonate 

content in comparison with the under and overlying layers. The authors indicated that these elemental pairs 

have similar crystallochemical properties and changes of the ratios should primarily reflect variations in 

sediment source. The geochemical data coupled with palaeontological and magnetic susceptibility results 

allowed association with tsunami events that had affected that region. 

Srinivasalu et al. (2007) reported, in India, a high content of dissolved salts in sediments (Na+, K+, 

Ca+2, Mg+2, Cl–) indicating that Cu, Pb, Zn were more enriched in the tsunami deposit than the other 

neighbouring coastal regions. The geochemical signature is a valuable tool in the tsunami recognition but 

cannot be used per si as a diagnostic signature of tsunami deposits. In fact, the changes in geochemistry 

observable in a geochemical profile are mainly due to saltwater inundation, carbonate enrichment (caused 

by increase in shells) and changes in sediment source, all these features being also observed in storm 

deposits provided (Table 2.2).

2.3.5. Geomorphological signature 

Dawson (1994) discussed the importance of changes caused by tsunami in coastal landscapes not 

only by direct tsunami-driven flow orthogonal to the shoreline, but also by episodes of vigorous backwash 

and by water flow sub-parallel to the coastline. He suggested that the combined effect of these processes 

could produce coastal landforms dominated by the effects of high-magnitude erosion and deposition. Even 

prior to this statement, Andrade (1990, 1992) studied the Ria Formosa (Algarve) barrier chain and noticed 

severe damage of the barrier chain in field observations, supported by cartographic and written documents. 

Such damages included the drowning of the western barrier, truncation of the oriental extremity of the barrier 

chain and extensive overwash of two of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira) accompanied by 

fast progradation of the easternmost ribbon of the Algarve sandy coast in the middle 18th century, and 

attributed these changes to the AD 1755 earthquake. Andrade (1992) showed that most of the the 

backbarrier surface of Tavira and Armona islands revealed a unique geomorphological pattern, compatible 

with the exceptional overwash event and with the drainage network reorganization process that must have 

followed the AD 1755 tsunami. 

Shi and Smith (2003) described evidence for coastal erosion and retreat that occurred along the northern 

coastal line of Flores Island (Indonesia) as a result of the 1992 tsunami. The authors correlated the scale of 

geomorphological changes with the observed tsunami run-up heights over a wide area. Similarly, Regnauld 

et al. (2004) and Oliveira et al. (2009) described dune erosion caused by multiple tsunami events in New 

Zealand and to the AD 1755 tsunami in Portugal. Meilianda et al. (2007) presented a quantitative budget of 

shoreline sediment fluxes before and immediately after a tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Through the 

study of remote sensing images they determined a chaotic shoreline retreat just after the tsunami. In the 

following six months 60% of the sediment loss had been compensated by shoreline accretion on the west 

coast of Banda Aceh city whereas further erosion (15% of the sediment loss during the tsunami) occurred on 

the northwest coast. The fact that not all locations showed a beach recovery after the tsunami stresses the 

importance of inner shelf processes and longshore currents in redistributing the sediment eroded at the 

coastline. In the same location, Fagherazzi and Du (2008) revealed that most of the morphological change 

occurred in the shore-normal direction, with large volumes of sand removed by the tsunami at the coastline 

later returned to the beach in a short time interval. A series of parallel, tapered incisions widening toward the 

coastline are characteristics of large flooding events such as tsunamis. In fact, flood scour features are 

indicator of tsunami events, given their unique morphology with width and depth of the same order of 

magnitude and their sharp boundaries. Goff et al. (2008) recognised region-wide dune remobilisation caused 

by tsunami inundation in New Zealand. 

In general terms, and based upon field evidence from 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, inundation by 

large, region-wide events is likely to cause multiple breaching of dune systems (Higman and Jaffe, 2005). In 

other words, multiple tsunami-scour fan assemblages can be formed during a single inundation. The 

assemblages could include remnant dune ridges, or pedestals, between each breach, and individual 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

32 
 

overwash fans that could coalesce to form landward sand sheets that may or may not be mobile depending 

upon aeolian and dune swale conditions (Goff et al., 2008). If landward sand sheets infill or overlay a 

wetland they can stabilise and weather in situ to form a low-profile hummocky topography. If they remain dry 

and are exposed to aeolian onshore processes they can form extensive, region-wide parabolic dune 

systems (Goff et al., 2008). Kench et al. (2009) observed that reef islands in the Maldives were 

geomorphically resilient to the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with the most immediate impacts 

being relatively minor with reductions in island area ranging from&amp;lt;1% to 9%. Overwash deposits, in the form 

of sand sheets and sand lobes, as well as strandlines and individual clasts of coral rubble, were the most 

common accretionary forms. These deposits represented a net addition to island surfaces, although their 

preservation potential as tsunami signatures may be low. 

See summary of tsunamigenic geomorphological signatures in Table 2.2. 

 

Summary:  

In summary, it is important to note that the criteria to recognize tsunami deposits (see Table 2.2) are still, at 

the present state of knowledge, ambiguous. Although the conjunction of the identification of sedimentary 

structures, the establishment of source material, the micropalaeontological analysis, geochemical 

characteristics and the study of geomorphological imprints in coastal landscape facilitates the identification 

of tsunami deposits; even if erosion and preservation is constrained by several facts. In fact, the 

contrast/peculiarity of the tsunami layers, especially when compared with under and overlying layers, 

provides in many cases the conclusive evidence for the recognition of such deposits. Data is commonly 

obtained through the use of sedimentologoical techniques - some have been widely used (e.g. textural and 

geomorphological) while others have been scarsely applied (e.g. microtextural analysis and heavy mineral 

assemblages); both have been used in modern tsunami sediments as well as in palaeotsunamis. Based in 

the references summarized in this sub-chapter and in Table 2.2 it is possible, through the use of diverse 

sedimentological proxies, to obtain information about the presence or absence of tsunami indicators, to 

establish their likely source or to collect valuable information about tsunami run-up, backwash or wave 

penetration inland. Recent events in Sumatra and Japan have been used to further develop the application 

and definition of sedimentary criteria to be used in the identification of tsunami deposits. However, in the 

study of palaeotsunamis a group of other questions (e.g. understanding mechanisms of inundation and 

deposition for each specific location, preservation of sedimentary structures and palaeontological evidences) 

still needs to be addressed in future studies in order to contribute to the development of more detailed and 

rigourous criteria that can further contribute to the accuracy of hazard maps.

2.4. Sedimentological features of onshore storm deposits 

(palaeotempestology) 

The understanding of storm processes, their depositional and preservation potential in coastal 

sedimentary sequences is until the present moment still poorly documented. There are several references to 

storm deposits (tempestites) in the sedimentary record some associated with older events (e.g. Rossetti, 

1997; Weidong et al., 1997) other with more recent (i.e. Holocene and present day) events (e.g. Liu and 

Fearn, 1993; Jelgersma et al., 1995; Otvos and Carter, 2008; Etienne and Paris, 2010; Dezileau et al., 

2011). Moreover, in the literature it can be found, similarly to tsunami deposits, references to boulder and to 

finer (typically sand-sized) deposits again in the dependence of event characteristics and sedimentary 

source. 

The study of storm deposits appears many times as a complementary tool to the establishment of 

storminess patterns associated with climatic changes (e.g. Donnelly et al., 2001; Andrade et al., 2008; 

Almeida et al., 2011). In fact, the study of tempestites provided grounds for the development of a new field of 

science: Palaeotempestology. This new area of research was greatly developed by the work of Liu and 

Fearn (1993), Liu and Fearn (2000), Donnelly et al. (2001), Donnelly et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2008), Switzer 

and Jones (2008), Etienne and Paris (2010) and Paris et al. (2011b) and it has been defined as “the 

reconstruction of past extreme events from sedimentary or erosional evidence left in the landscape as a 

result of storm surge and wave action” (Nott, 2003). Palaeotempestology is based in the analysis of the 

sedimentary record of storms/hurricanes/typhoons and is used to extend the historical record through the 

use of geological data and provide further knowledge to recurrence analysis. Palaeotempestological 

research has mainly focused in low latitude (i.e. hurricane prone) areas, for instance in back-barrier 

environments on siliclastic coasts (Switzer and Burston, 2010) including areas of tropical cyclones in 

northern Australia (e.g. Chappell et al., 1983; Chivas et al., 1986; Hayne and Chappell, 2001), southern and 

eastern United States (e.g. Collins et al., 1999; Donnelly et al., 2001; Liu and Fearn, 1993, 2000), and to a 

lesser extent throughout the south Pacific islands (e.g. Mckee, 1959). Furthermore, records of storms have 

also been identified in the internal stratigraphy of coastal dune systems (Jelgersma et al., 1995). Zong and 

Tooley (1999) suggested that reliable storm-surge signatures can only be developed by using appropriate 

analytical techniques, such as determining the particle-size distribution of the storm layers and comparing 

them to associated/under and overlying non-storm sequences (Delaney and Devoy, 1995). This later 

sentence confirms that textural contrast is one of the criteria that have been used to identify storm deposits. 

Over the past two decades, a growing list of palaeotempestology studies, including some that are supported 

by the comparison with modern analogue events, have confirmed that overwash sand layers within the 

stratigraphy of coastal lakes and marshes can be a reliable proxy for major storm events. 

A number of sediment-based proxies have been developed such as cyclone surge-constructed 

beach ridges (Nott and Hayne, 2001; Nott et al., 2009) and overwash deposits preserved in back barrier 

lagoons (Donnelly, 2005; Donnelly and Woodruff, 2007; Wallace and Anderson, 2010), coastal lakes (Liu 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

35 
 

and Fearn, 1993, 2000; Lambert et al., 2003, 2008), and marshes (Donnelly et al., 2001, 2004; Boldt et al., 

2010). Liu and Fearn (1993) have shown from coastal Alabama, U.S.A., that a series of hurricanes during 

historical time deposited multiple sand layers across low-lying coastal wetlands. Similarly, Davis et al. (1989) 

argued that hurricanes produced graded or homogeneous deposits of sand, shell, gravel and mud within the 

prominently clastic sediments in the coastal lagoons of Florida. Storm deposits can leave a sheet like 

deposit extending a few hundred of m inland. For instance the Hurricane Ivan (2004) deposit extended 200–

300m while Katrina expanded up to a maximum 450m width (Otvos and Carter, 2008). It has been observed 

that storms can cause localized erosional surfaces in lagoonal and lake deposits. Such surfaces also 

occurred near the lakeward ends of storm breaches, inlets and elsewhere in coastal basins (Donnelly and 

Woodruff, 2007; Woodruff et al., 2009). Rip-up clasts and scours in tidal marsh deposits also reflect storm 

erosion. Furthermore, Donnelly et al. (2001) demonstrated that recent and historic major hurricanes on the 

United States Atlantic coast left a stratigraphically distinct and regionally consistent record of overwash sand 

layers in the sediments of the coastal marshes. In terms of sediment source Lu and Liu (2005) studying 

hurricane events in Alabama (United States) concluded that the tempestite sand layers are similar to those 

from the dune environments, thus suggesting that they were transported from the dunes by overwash 

processes. More recently Lambert et al. (2008) proposed the use of organic geochemical proxies as a new 

tool in palaeotempestology, utilizing isotope ?13C and ?15N concentrations and ratios in organic-enriched 

muds. The changes observed in these isotopes were attributed to specific storm events. 

The use of palaeotempestology data to establish frequency of events and minimum wave heights of 

extreme marine inundations has been applied with success, for instance, in the eastern coast of the United 

States.  Boldt et al. (2010) presented a 2000 year record of overwash deposition preserved in a backbarrier 

salt marsh from south eastern New England (United States) and were able to establish that during the last 

ca. 375 years only historical hurricanes with surges of at least 2m were preserved in the Mattapoisett Marsh 

sediments. A similar study was conducted by Lane et al. (2011) in Mullet Pond, Florida (United States). In 

this study, a 4500 year record of Holocene hurricane storm surges was obtained. The record with sub-

decadal resolution allowed the establishment of an average event frequency of 3.9 storms per century, 

greater than that of any published palaeohurricane record. The authors acknowledge that although the 

largest historic hurricane events were represented in the record, some smaller events went undetected 

resulting in an underestimate of the number of storms impacting the site through time. The authors also 

observed that shallow, benthic foraminifera (living in depths of 1 to 5m below msl, i.e. up to 3 to 5 km 

seaward of the shoreline) were present in deposits associated with the AD 1941 hurricane and possibly 

Dennis (AD 2005). McCloskey and Keller (2009) studied six major hurricanes that were detected in the 

sedimentary record of the past 500 years along the central coast of Belize representing 1 to 1.2 catastrophic 

storms every 100 years in the study area. 

The majority of palaeotempestites have been observed in the United States eastern coast due to 

more intensive research, favourable sedimentary basins that can retain the sedimentary deposits and to the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

more hurricane-prone climatic conditions. In addition, the large width and extreme low-gradient of the shelf 

and morphological continuum in features characterizing the shelf and the extensive adjacent low-lying 

coastal areas favour the development of intensive surges in association with tropical storms. In Europe 

similar deposits have been described, such as reported by Jelgersma et al. (1995), which observed shell 

deposits found in dune fields at five different sites along the central Netherland coast and associated these 

deposits with several Holocene storm surge events. Andrade et al. (2004) tested the geological record of 

storminess through the analysis of a group of five marsh detached beaches and one active marginal beach 

in the Ria Formosa barrier islands (Portugal) area using sedimentological, paleoecological (Foraminifera and 

Diatoms), geometrical and stratigraphical information derived from sediment cores which were interpreted by 

comparison with present-day analogues. They concluded that the lithostratigraphical framework indicated 

that multiple sand bodies were present in some cores, with limited lateral extension and separated by muddy 

lagoonal sediments indicating that distinct episodes of entrainment of marine sand into the lagoonal space 

alternated with low-energy sedimentation. In the same region, Matias et al. (2008) studied 28 storm events 

during a 3 year study period (2001-2004). Depending on the volume state of the barrier island, storm waves 

caused either erosion of the beach (net negative supratidal sedimentary balance) or promoted intense 

overwash that contributed to barrier enlargement by extensive sedimentary deposition (overwash). Ruiz et 

al. (2007) studied the Holocene infilling of the Odiel estuary (Gulf of Cadiz) using lithological, stratigraphical, 

geochemical, and palaeontological data which allowed the recognition of the oldest known Holocene storm 

in this area (ca. 5705 14C years BP). In this area, the geological record of storm events is constituted by: (a) 

sandy layers with basal erosional surfaces interlayered in muddy sediments; (b) new beach ridges added 

periodically to sandy spits; or (c) lumachellic layers of mollusc shells interbedded within massive, bioturbated 

levels. Dezileau et al. (2011) studied the Languedoc–Roussillon region (French Mediterranean coast) and 

identified four distinct, overwash deposits at more than 500m from the sandy barrier. The authors 

demonstrated that the geomorphic setting of the studied area has not changed drastically during the last 

1500 years, and attributed these four overwash deposits to catastrophic storms of category 3 intensity or 

more. 

Storms surveys conducted immediately after the events have been carried out throughout the 

world. Two examples of those campaigns and the recognition of sedimentary imprints left by storms are 

described by Dawson et al. (2007) and Horton et al. (2009). Horton et al. (2009) collected data from 

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita storm surges along the Alabama and Mississippi (United States) coastline. 

Ground surveys of local topography, storm surge high water marks and flow direction were conducted. In 

Mississippi, Hurricane Katrina storm surge extended inland more than 750m. The differences between the 

pre-storm surge and storm surge sediment were defined by the following characteristics: erosional boundary 

between sedimentary units accompanied by a change in colour and a change in lithology; and the storm 

surge sediment was coarser than the pre-storm surge unit and with lower organic content. The thickness of 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

37 
 

the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita storm surge sediments ranged from 7 to 13cm. Foraminiferal analyses in all 

three sites revealed a virtual absence of tests within the storm surges sediments. 

Dawson et al. (2007) analysed the coastal changes observed in the Hebrides Islands (Scotland) associated 

with the Great Storm of January 2005. The hurricane-force winds together with a storm surge resulted in 

significant change in coastal landscape along the entire western seabord and, in particular, on headlands 

(Angus and Rennie, 2007). In general, severe erosion was focused along coastal areas located west of the 

causeways that link North Uist and Benbecula, Benbecula and South Uist and South Uist and Eriskay. 

According to Dawson et al. (2007) the coastal response to the storm was complex. In some areas, coastal 

dunes were subject to significant retreat. In other areas deposition of shingle and even boulders was 

observed. In both cases described above erosion and deposition (of material available in the coastal fringe) 

was observed in association with overwash caused by major storm events. 

From all of the above it can be stated that storm overwash is undoubtedly a powerful agent in 

beach and dune erosion and backbarrier sand accumulation. Typical washovers generally consist of fan- or 

sheet-like subaerial to subaqueous accumulations of sand supplied by storm overwash from the nearshore 

areas and supratidal sediment resident on barrier island and mainland surfaces. Of highly variable thickness, 

these sequentially developed landforms are mutually superimposed during consecutive storm events by 

sediment gravity flow influenced by fluid effects (Middleton and Hampton, 1973). Washovers or overwash 

fans are elongated lobate, parabola- and flame-shaped landforms. Factors that influence the dimensions 

and outlines of fans and related overwash bedforms include wind-induced surge elevation, astronomical tide, 

wave setup and run-up, the intensity and duration of channelled flow, the presence of topographic 

obstructions, and the volumes of sand in the shoreface and beach with dunes that are available for erosion 

and subsequent deposition by overwash (Donnelly et al., 2001; Boldt et al., 2010). Sedgwick and Davis 

(2003), Morton et al. (2007) and Horton et al. (2009) recognized multiple sedimentary structures related to 

deposition of individual overwash units. Sand and mud layers of contrasting clast dimensions and microfossil 

(Foraminifera and Diatoms) content formed these beds. 

Most of Holocene fine grain-sized storm deposits have been discussed in comparison with tsunami events. 

Storm deposits are difficult to distinguish from tsunami deposits because, similar to the latter, they also may 

contain marine or brackish water macro and microfossils, retain saltwater geochemical imprints, and thin and 

fine landward (Nelson et al., 1996). Some studies use distance inland to indicate a tsunami source, arguing 

that it is not likely that storm waves or surge could deposit sand inland to the extent indicated by a number of 

deposit atributed to be of tsunami origin (Clague et al., 2000). When layers of both events are present in the 

same location their number and thickness have sometimes been used to differentiate between a tsunami 

and a storm genesis (Williams and Hutchinson, 2000). Tsunami deposits tend to have several relatively thick 

normally graded beds, suggesting deposition from graded suspension by successive waves in the tsunami 

wave train, whereas storm deposits may be expected to have thinner and more numerous laminations, from 

higher frequency but lower energy storm waves (Nelson et al., 1996). Moreover, Abramson (1998) uses the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

38 
 

presence of rip-up clasts in the deposit to indicate the higher energy deposition of a tsunami although this is 

in contrast with other findings (e.g. Switzer, 2008). 

Recently, a number of papers revisited the issue of distinguishing tsunami and storm deposits (Nanayama et 

al., 2000; Goff et al., 2004; Tuttle et al., 2004; Morton et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Switzer 

and Jones, 2008). Nanayama et al. (2000) described deposits associated with the 1993 Japan Sea tsunami 

and the 1959 Miyakojima typhoon in the same location in the Hokkaido coast, Japan. The main differences 

detected were that the tsunami deposit consisted of four beds, showing evidence of bidirectional currents 

associated with land- and seaward flow of the two main waves and contained marine sand, gravel, seashells 

and eroded soil. In opposition, the storm deposit showed a unidirectional current, contains foreset bedding 

and was better sorted than the tsunami deposit. Bryant and Nott (2001) compared geomorphological 

implications of tsunami and storms. They make the point that storms tend to only surge through gaps in 

dunes, sporadically depositing lobate fans that rarely penetrate far inland. This can be considered as a key 

difference between storm and tsunami geomorphology but this is more controversial in areas of low 

accumulation space (e.g. in a small pocket beach, there may be insufficient longshore and landward 

accumulation space for more than one lobate fan and two pedestals) (Goff et al., 2008). 

Gelfenbaum et al., (2002) suggested that “In the absence of a historically-documented context, 

and/or the preservation of both types of deposit at the same location, researchers must make comparisons 

between the studies of the sedimentary records of individual storm and tsunami deposits from widely 

separated sites around the world”. Indeed, one should have in consideration the countless site-specific 

variables such as sediment supply, nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography. Tuttle et al. (2004) 

compared the deposits of the AD 1929 Grand Banks tsunami with the AD 1991 Halloween storm in 

Massachusetts, in the eastern coast of the United States. The tsunami deposit had one to three sub-units of 

massive or normal graded sand, whereas the storm deposit showed lamination, delta foreset stratification 

and sub-horizontal, planar stratification with channels. The tsunami deposit can be traced further inland and 

to a higher elevation than the storm deposit. However, because both deposits were not found at the same 

location, differences due to site-specific variations have to be considered. 

Goff et al. (2004) compared a 15th century tsunami deposits and sediments emplaced by an Easter 2002 

storm. Both deposits are peculiar in local extent, thickness, and grain size. According to Goff et al. (2004) 

the main differences can be summarized as follows: 

(a) The tsunami deposit thins abruptly at the margins and fines inland as opposed to exhibiting the 

highly variable characteristics of the storm deposit with a marked coarsening at its landward extent. 

(b) The storm deposit is slightly better sorted and coarser than the tsunami deposit. A coarser grain 

size is probably the result of differences in sampling regime as opposed to wave energy, while a better 

sorting reflects the wider range of grain sizes entrained by the tsunami both on land and onshore. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

39 
 

(c) Differences in the landward characteristics of these inundation events are reflected in the 

contrast between the erosional contact and entrainment of rip-up clasts of the tsunami and the sharp contact 

of the storm deposit. Both are associated with buried soils and/or vegetation, but only the tsunami 

penetrated far enough inland to affect archaeological material. 

(d) Variations in the preservation of evidence are a reflection of the age of deposition. 

 

Morton et al. (2007) suggested some differences between tsunami and storms based on only two 

tsunami deposits (from Peru and Papua New Guinea) and two storm surge deposits (from Texas and North 

Carolina). The clear suggestion from their work is that tsunamis and storm deposits have much more 

similarities than differences. Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) analysed a group of samples from Martinhal 

(SW Algarve, Portugal). The authors recognised tsunami deposits (associated with the AD 1755 event) and 

several, more recent, storm deposits in this location. The authors concluded that Foraminifera assemblages 

and grain size characteristics are almost identical in both type of events although tsunami deposits present 

higher concentration of Foraminifera and some boulders with borings of molluscs. The main difference 

detected was the inland extent of the tsunami deposit when compared with the storm events. Switzer and 

Jones (2008) tried to establish the source of a marine deposit detected in a closed freshwater back-barrier 

lagoon on the southeast Australian coast. Their studies were based on comparisons with modern storm 

deposits from the same coast and sedimentological diagnostic criteria derived from studies of modern storm- 

and tsunami-deposited sandsheets (Figure 2.2). 

Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008) compared tsunami, storm-surge and nearshore sediments. The 

authors detected that storm surge sediments were better sorted than all the tsunami samples studied. The 

relatively high heavy mineral content and the scarce presence of open marine microfossils also helped to 

diagnose the storm-surge sediments. Morton et al. (2008) studied coastal gravel-ridge complexes deposited 

on islands in the Caribbean Sea as recorders of past extreme-wave events that could be associated with 

either tsunamis or hurricanes. The ridge complexes of Bonaire, Jamaica, Puerto Rico (Isla de Mona) and 

Guadeloupe consist of polymodal clasts ranging in size from sand to coarse boulders that are derived from 

the adjacent coral reefs or subjacent rock platforms. Ridge-complex morphologies and crest elevations are 

largely controlled by availability of sediments, clast sizes, and heights of wave run-up. Together, the 

morphologic, sedimentologic, lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic evidences indicated that shore-

parallel ridge complexes composed of gravel and sand that are tens of m wide and several meters thick are 

primarily storm-constructed features that have accumulated for a few centuries or millennia as a result of 

multiple high-frequency intense-wave events.

The recognition of tsunami boulder deposits has been previously discussed in this thesis. The 

complex processes associated with the transport inland and upwards of boulders and their association with 

a specific type of marine inundations requires, almost on every occasion, the use of hydrodynamic equations 

to establish wave height or velocities (e.g. Nott, 2003) and associate them with specific events. 

More recently, Goto et al. (2011) stressed once again the importance of the development of precise 

numerical modelling of boulder transport as a key method to assist in discriminating between tsunami and 

storm wave boulders. While these models are still being developed by the scientific community is fairly 

relevant that the definition of sedimentological criteria to differentiate tsunami and storm deposits is 

enhanced and developed. Hall et al. (2006) characterized cliff-top storm deposits of the Atlantic coasts of the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

British Isles and were able to recognize that these deposits form a distinctive end member to the much 

larger group of coarse clastic storm features. The authors concluded that the detailed configuration of the 

coast, particularly the size, height, orientation and form of the cliff edge and top, exerts a major control on 

the distribution, altitude, clast orientation and clast size of the storm cliff-top deposits. Etienne and Paris 

(2010) provided a new insight for the interpretation of boulder deposits by highlighting the geomorphic 

effects of powerful storms. The authors observed that during the winter of 2008 in Iceland boulders up to 16t 

were transported inland. However, the authors concluded that notwithstanding the drastic seasonal 

individual changes, at a larger scale, boulder deposits (beaches or ridges) are landforms with a strong 

permanence in the landscape over years. Also recently, Paris et al. (2011b) edited a review on boulders and 

megaclasts deposited by storm waves on rocky coasts. The authors discussed the possibility of storm 

events as likely mechanisms for boulder transport in high and temperate latitudes. 

Recent studies (Goto et al., 2010a, 2010b; Etienne and Paris, 2010; Richmond et al., 2011) have 

proposed that tsunami and storm boulder deposits can be differentiated by considering the position relative 

to source, size, distance travelled and breakage of boulders. They suggested that the approach of coupling 

sedimentology and geomorphology can be applied to other boulder fields, but requires further testing in 

other locations. Goto et al. (2011) studied the emplacement and movement of boulders by known storm 

waves based in field evidences from Okinawa Island, Japan. They concluded that no single method to 

discriminate boulders deposited by the tsunami or storm waves appears to be universally applicable to all 

cases in the world. Nevertheless, the authors discuss the possibility that boulders can be discriminated in 

each case when local complexities of waves, topography, and characteristics of boulders are considered. 

The few studies specifically designed to compare characteristics of historical tsunami and storm 

finer grained deposits (e.g. Nanayama et al., 2000; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Goff et al., 2004; Tuttle et 

al., 2004; Switzer and Jones, 2008) were conducted at the same or nearby sites. This eliminated or reduced 

inter-site sediment and landscape variability but prevented the comparison of impacts of events of similar 

intensities, elsewhere. In conclusion, storm deposits share many textural, palaeontological, geochemical and 

geomorphological characteristics with tsunami deposits making their differentiation a complex task. This is 

also further complicated by studies addressing storm activity but not clearly separating storm surge from 

storm wave impacts and sedimentation. The diversity of topographic, hydrodynamic, and sedimentological 

settings as well as post-depositional settings account for major difficulties in correlating individual sand 

layers with specific prehistoric storm events. This complicates or prevents identification of specific events, 

their velocity categories, calculations of recurrence interval probabilities and accurate risk assessment. The 

differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits is of crucial importance for studies of hazard risk and the 

development and improvement of sedimentary criteria is a scientific requisite.

2.5. Record of tsunami and storm deposits in the study areas 

2.5.1. Atlantic Iberia 

Several onshore and some offshore tsunami deposits have been detected in this region. Most of 

the deposits have been described in association with the AD 1755 tsunami although deposits associated 

with older events have also been described (Figure 2.3).

deposits numbered in red; boulder deposits numbered in black). 1: Aveiro - Corrochano et al. (2000); 2: Tagus estuary -

In the western coast of Portugal, there are references to the AD 1755 tsunami washover deposits in the 

Aveiro lagoon (Corrochano et al., 2000), to silt-clay sedimentation in the Tagus estuary (Andrade et al., 

2003) and erosion and deposition of coarser material in the Tagus prodelta (Abrantes et al., 2005; 2008). 

Furthermore, in the Guincho area (W of Lisbon), Scheffers and Kelletat (2005) detected a number of 

megaclasts and attributed their displacement to tsunamigenic mechanisms of different ages including the AD 

1755 tsunami, although the absolute age-estimation they have used is controversial. In addition to 

megaclasts they described boulder fields and ridges standing at heights of more than 10m above msl

bearing evidences of having been moved inland from the source region and thus associated to one or more 

tsunami events that affected this region. The authors also argue to have found a vegetation scar and beach 

sand with perfectly rounded pebbles in the same area of tsunami origin. Approximately 40 km to the north of 

Cascais (i.e. Praia dos Coxos-Ericeira) a peculiar limestone boulder accumulation was identified in a rocky 

platform and the possibility of its transport and deposition by one or multiple tsunami events has been 

discussed (Oliveira, 2011). Andrade et al. (2003) found evidences in sediment cored from the Tagus 

marshes that were correlated with the AD 1755, AD 1531 and with one older event tentatively dated of the 

14th century AD. The techniques used include vertical variation of the bulk magnetic susceptibility, 

geochemistry, nannoplankton (abundance and diversity) and a range of sedimentological proxies. The 

evidences were provided by the changes detected in those units laid down by high energy marine events. 

These changes included slight increases in SiO2 and CaCO3 and abrupt changes in magnetic susceptibility 

values (suggesting temporary disturbance of sediment sources) together with increases in calcareous 

nannoplankton. On the other hand, in the Tagus prodelta, Abrantes et al. (2005, 2008) sampled the shelf 

area just offshore Lisbon. They were able to identify an “instantaneous deposit” of coarser material 

(including broken carbonate shells) on the SSW coring site; and a 1.5m “instantaneous deposit” of fine 

material on the W site in sediment collected in their box-cores. Magnetic susceptibility, grain-size and XRF-

Fe data as well as 210Pb and AMS 14C age-estimation were used to characterize the material and time-

constrain the deposition. By considering the ages of the underlying undisturbed unit, a hiatus was 

recognised at both sites studied, roughly corresponding to 355 years of sedimentation. Both the hiatus and 

instantaneous deposits were considered to be of tsunamigenic origin, the former corresponding to an 

erosive episode and the latter to sedimentation, both in association with the backwash of the same tsunami 

event. Also in the south western coast of Portugal, Pereira et al. (2007) identified, in the Malhão beach and 

dune field (approximately 150 km south of Lisbon), which develop in close association with aeolianite 

outcrops, a group of 43 boulders located from 20 up to 135m inland of the present day coastline. The 

highest boulder is located at 19m above msl and the heaviest boulder weights 19t. By means of a 

straightforward application of Nott’s equations and identification of some geomorphological features, the 

authors concluded that the only event capable of transporting and deposited boulders of such dimensions 

was the AD 1755 tsunami. 

The tsunami deposits of AD 1755 that were deposited along the Algarve coastline mostly consist of 

a laterally extensive layer of shell-rich sand, which ramps and thins landwards, displaying an erosive base 

and an irregular, sometime undulating, upper boundary; this boundary may be sharp or made of a subtle 

textural and compositional transition to the overlying sediment. In some locations, the tsunami deposit is 

entirely composed of sand. In other areas, the tsunami deposits are characterized by sand sheets containing 

isolated cobbles, which preferably concentrate at the base of the tsunami deposit. Andrade (1990, 1992) 

detected tsunami deposits in sections of the barrier-island chain of Ria Formosa, central Algarve. He 

concluded that the AD 1755 earthquake was responsible for severe damage of the barrier chain at Ria

Formosa, leading to the drawning and amputation of its oriental extremity and to the extensive overwash of 

two of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira). Moreover, Andrade (1992) also refers that the 

morphological analysis of the backbarrier surface of these two islands reveals a unique pattern, compatible 

with the exceptional overwash event and with the drainage network reorganization process that must have 

followed the AD 1755 tsunami. Dawson et al. (1995), Hindson et al. (1996) and Hindson and Andrade (1999) 

identified a tsunami deposit attributed to the AD 1755 tsunami, at Boca do Rio lowland, western Algarve 

coast of Portugal. Detailed historical record of the AD 1755 tsunami flooding described the destruction of a 

contemporaneous coastal dune by the incoming tsunami waves (Silva Lopes, 1841). The tsunamigenic unit, 

referred to by Dawson et al. (1995) as a “chaotic layer”, “consists of a massive structureless matrix of detrital 

sediment ranging from a muddy/sandy conglomerate to coarse muddy sand. According to Hindson and 

Andrade (1999) this unit marks a distinct sedimentological and micropalaeontological break from the 

deposits enclosing it. Those authors noted the lowermost section of the deposit appears to have been 

deposited from a highly turbulent water mass, which was able to transport gravel-sized limestone clasts as 

well as gravel sized mud balls eroded from the underlying estuarine soft material (rip-up clasts). The water 

mass rapidly lost energy as it progressed inland, leading to the deposition of predominantly shell-rich sand, 

silt and clay particles. Andrade et al. (1997) and Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) also described a tsunami 

deposit in Martinhal, east of Sagres. This massive deposit, which extends across most of the lowland area, 

was suggested to have being laid down by the AD 1755 tsunami (Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007). Besides 

the tsunami deposit, the stratigraphy of Martinhal also displays evidence for the activity of storm waves that 

have breached and overtopped the barrier, flooding the lowland and leaving thin sandy overwash layers, but 

of smaller inland extension. Both types of marine-derived flood deposits showed similar grain size 

characteristics and distinctive contents in benthic Foraminifera, evidenced by the predominantly marine 

assemblage of the tsunamigenic unit with the presence of Elphidium macellum, E. crispum, Quinqueloculina 

seminulum, Cibicides refulgens, C. lobatulus, Eponides repandus and Ammonia. beccarii var. Batavus, but 

also brackish species such as H. germanica and A. beccarii. The most important differences between storm 

and tsunami deposits were the rip-up clasts and boulders that were exclusively found in the tsunami deposit 

and the landward extent of the tsunami deposit that everywhere exceeded that of the storm deposits. 

Schneider et al. (2009) analysed cores from the Carcavai valley, near Quarteira (east of Salgados, in the 

central Algarve), and detected that one prominent sand layer interrupts the fine-grained sedimentation. After 

radiocarbon age-estimation, the authors suggested that this peculiar unit might have been deposited by the 

AD 1755 tsunami, although the sum of evidences forwarded to support this origin is small and questionable. 

Still in the vicinity of Quarteira, in Salgados, Costa et al. (2009, 2012a) detected and characterized a tsunami 

deposit within Late Holocene lagoonal sediments of Lagoa dos Salgados, based in the recognition of many 

of the stratigraphical, textural and compositional diagnostic criteria used to recognize this type of deposition 

elsewhere. Furthermore, results of age constraining using 210Pb, 137Cs and 14C methods yielded results that 

were mutually consistent and coherent with the AD 1755 tsunami. Immediately to the west of Salgados, 

Alcantarilha lowland is located. Within this lowland Dinis et al. (2010) observed geomorphological features

that provided support for a major overwash deposit that not only eroded the top part of a sector of the 

confining dune ridge but was also responsible for the deposition of a fan-shaped sandy layer, which attaches 

to the toe of the leeward slope of the dune and thins and wedges out further inland into the adjacent alluvial 

plain sediments. The authors interpreted that the most probable mechanism for these sedimentary 

evidences should be a tsunami event and 210Pb and137Cs data once more suggests it may date of AD 1755. 

Cunha et al. (2010) revisited Boca do Rio and Martinhal AD 1755 tsunami deposits to improve the age 

model by using OSL age-estimation with a higher number of aliquots. Contrary to previous works, the 

authors obtained a good set of dates for the deposit, although an age overestimation of the tsunami-laid 

sands was attributed to the rapid erosion and deposition of older sediments, with insufficient light exposure 

for complete bleaching during the tsunami event itself. Costa et al. (2011) observed in the Barranco and 

Furnas alluvial plains a relatively unique size-range of the particles [0.3 - 1m (a-axis diameter)] that were 

transported inland a few hundred meters into the alluvial plain. The radiocarbon dates obtained through the 

use of in situ endolithic shells suggested that transport was contemporary with the AD 1755 tsunami. 

Further east in the Gulf of Cadiz, several tsunamigenic deposits have been recognized both 

onshore (e.g. Lario et al., 2011) and offshore (e.g. Gracia et al., 2010). Luque et al. (2001) conducted 

studies of sedimentary deposits of the Valdelagrana spit and barrier complex (Cadiz, Spain). A depositional 

event was detected within the barrier complex and it was suggested that it recorded an event similar to the 

AD 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which might have occurred at 216-218 BC. More recent single-event deposits 

of the Valdelagrana spit were correlated with the AD 1755 tsunami. The older deposits could be 

contemporaneous and correlated with deposits observed in estuarine lowlands of the Donana National Park, 

SW Spain (Ruiz et al., 2005). Ruiz et al. (2005) conducted studies focused in the Mid-Holocene evolution of 

sedimentary environments of the Doñana National Park. They concluded that in the last 5300–3700 cal. 

years BP interval a progressive estuarine infilling conditioned by the growth of channel levees and the 

progradation of the Donana spit towards the east has occurred. This infilling pattern was being periodically 

interrupted by high-energy events causing the breakthrough of the Donana spit and inducing biological crisis 

of the estuarine faunas. These crisis induced temporary but strong reduction of the characteristic estuarine 

assemblages (detected in ostracods and bivalves), with introduction of reworked marine faunas towards the 

inner estuary. Several sedimentary units associated with these barrier breaching episodes and faunal crisis 

were associated with different tsunamigenic events, including the AD 1755 tsunami. Morales et al. (2008) 

investigated tsunami deposits in the Tinto-Odiel estuary (Huelva). They characterized the outer part of the 

estuary by extensive sand-rich sedimentary bodies of marine origin, whereas the central and inner parts 

were filled by muddy, tidally deposited sediment bodies. Recorded within these inner estuarine sediment 

bodies five laterally continuous shelly units were detected. According to Morales et al. (2008), each of these 

units displayed many of the typical characteristics of tsunami deposits, comprising an erosional base 

followed by a fining-upward sand-sized sequence that begins with shell accumulation and ends with 

bioturbated muddy sand. The results of 14C ages and indirect age-estimation using accumulation rates

derived from the study of recent radionuclides suggest that these five tsunami deposits correspond with 

known events that occurred in AD 1755, 1531, 949 (1033?), 881, and 395 (381?), all of which are 

documented in historical sources (Morales et al.,2008). 

Still in the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, the work on boulder deposits of Whelan and Kelletat (2005) 

deserves a special note. In Cape Trafalgar, they detected approximately 280 imbricated megaclasts 

weighing between 1 and 10t that were observed resting between high tide level and 5m above in a coastal 

stretch of 100m long directly south of that headland. They argued that the larger boulders preserved at Cape 

Trafalgar are the only possible proofs for a tsunami event along an approximately 100 km stretch of 

coastline between the mouth of the Guadalquivir and Punta Camarinal, halfway between Barbate and Tarifa. 

However, Reicherter et al. (2010) identified outcrop evidences for paleo-tsunamis along a 50 km long 

segment of the Atlantic coast of southern Spain. According to these authors several depositional 

environments in the coast between Barbate and Tarifa yielded preserve tsunamigenic sediment layers 

among other evidences of tsunami impacts, both on top of rocky cliffs as well as in lagoons and in 

marshlands. The authors associated deposits identified with the AD 1755 but also attributed multiple 

intercalations to older tsunamis. 

Storms have been defined for this area as events where the significant height (Hs) of waves is 

greater than 3m (Pessanha and Pires, 1981). In terms of storm deposits only over recent years the 

sedimentary effects have been described and/or monitored in greater detail (e.g. Andrade et al., 2004; 

Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Matias et al., 2008; Almeida et al., 2011). Andrade et al. (2004) studied 

marsh detached beaches in Ria Formosa lagoon and were able to detect storm deposits within the 

lithostratigraphical framework observed in cores. These (multiple) sand bodies had limited lateral extension 

and were separated by muddy lagoonal sediments indicating that distinct episodes of entrainment of marine 

sand into the lagoonal space alternated with low-energy sedimentation. In the same region, Matias et al. 

(2008) using aerial photographs observed a total of 369 different washovers along the lagoonal boundary of 

Ria Formosa barriers during the period 1947-2001. The number of washovers remained relatively stable 

from 1947 to 1972 and increased dramatically between 1972 and 1976 probably as a result of the 

development of immature inlet margins and downdrift starvation. From 1976 to 2001, washover occurrences 

declined and their spatial dimensions diminished, leading to a decrease in overwash activity over this time. 

According to these authors, exceptional to infrequent oceanographic conditions are the only formation 

mechanism able to generate an overwash in well-developed and stable foredunes. Although inundation of 

established foredunes was not observed for the studied period, this phenomenon has been described for the 

eastern section of Ancão barrier (Andrade, 1990) as a result of exceptional storm conditions during the 1941 

cyclone. Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) in Martinhal used a combination of grain size and foraminiferal 

analyses to assess differences between tsunami and storm deposits. Only the tsunami deposit contained 

large boulders, sometimes with borings of molluscs at their surface and intraclasts eroded from the 

underlying surface. Oliveira et al. (2011) used field observations, aerial photography and wave data to

characterize the transport of two megaclasts weighting 14 and 8t and sitting at present above 1.70m above 

msl in the upper shore platform of Praia das Maçãs (west Portuguese coast – approximately 20 km north of 

Cascais) and associate them with a specific event (storm in 1973). 

 

2.5.2. Scotland 

By far the biggest tsunami that has struck the coastline of Scotland was the tsunami associated 

with the giant Storegga submarine landslide located on the continental slope west of Norway that took place 

ca. 8000 yr BP (Figure 2.4). However, recent studies have shown that the Holocene Storegga Slide is just 

one of a series of mega-slides (&gt;2000 km2) that have occurred offshore mid-Norway since the end of the 

Pliocene, with a frequency of roughly 100,000 years over the last 0.5 Ma (Bryn et al., 2002). 

Deposits from the Storegga tsunami have been found in NE England (e.g. Horton et al., 1999; 

Shennan et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2004), N Sotland (Dawson et al., 1996; Dawson and Smith, 2000), NE 

Scotland (e.g. Dawson et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Tooley and Smith, 2005), Shetland Islands (e.g. 

Bondevik et al., 2003; Bondevik et al., 2005; Dawson et al., 2006), Faroe Islands (e.g. Grauert et al., 2001) 

and to north of the Arctic Circle along the coast of Norway (e.g. Bondevik et al., 1997) and Greenland 

(Wagner et al., 2007) (Figure 2.4). The tsunami sediments associated with the Storegga slide can be 

generally described as consisting mainly of fine or fine to medium sand, sometimes with some silt and clay 

and very occasionally containing gravel or stones in the basal layers. It often contains fragments or 

intraclasts of organic material and sometimes intraclasts of silt while rip-up clasts of peat have also been 

identified. Typically the tsunami units present at least one fining upwards sequence, commonly with bi-modal 

size distribution, and present a maximum thickness of 1.56m but the deposit is normally ca. 10–30 cm thick 

(Smith et al., 2004). The microfossil content (Diatoms and Foraminifera) of the tsunamigenic layer provides 

grounds to support a high-energy event of marine origin involving sediments of probably local provenance 

(Smith et al., 2004). In NE England, near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Horton et al. (1999) and Shennan et al. 

(2000) described a sand horizon of marine provenance within a coastal peat moss and attributed it to a high-

energy flood. The singularity of the layer in the sediment sequence, its stratigraphically unconformable lower 

contact in the transect, implying erosion of underlying sediments; its rapid rise up-valley in the transect to 

exceed the height of later marine deposits and its age range, allowed the identification of the sand layer as a 

probable Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami deposit.

Figure 2.4 - White dots show where tsunami deposits associated with theStoregga slide have been mapped. Other slides 
are the Trænadjupet slide dated to ca. 4000 14Cyr BP, slides on the NE Faroe margin and the small Afen slide in the Faroe–

Shetland Channel (adapted from Bondevik et al., 2005). 

 

In NE Scotland, in Montrose, the first traces of tsunamigenic units were discussed by Dawson et al. 

(1988) describing within uplifted coastal sediment sequences an unusual mainly fine or medium sand layer, 

occasionally coarser, but with some silt and sometimes containing intraclasts of peat. Other similar deposits 

in different locations in NE Scotland have since then been associated with the Storegga slide (e.g. Tooley 

and Smith, 2005). In Inverness, excavations revealed a Mesolithic horizon covered by a layer of marine sand 

that was ascribed to the Storegga tsunami (Dawson et al., 1990). In northern Sutherland (North Scotland), 

Dawson et al. (1996) and Dawson and Smith (2000) described a coarser layer in marked contrast to the 

under and overlying sediments. A pronounced erosional unconformity with the underlying sediments was 

observed. The presence of a mixed diatom assemblage, although fragmentary, indicated a chaotic 

accumulation of the deposit with all habitats represented. Variations in particle size within the sequence 

disclosed strong similarities with other tsunami deposits elsewhere in the North Sea basin and previously 

associated with the Storegga slide. 

In Norway, a group of coastal lakes recorded the marine input of water and sediment that the 

Storegga tsunami caused in the coastal fringe (Bondevik et al., 1997). The deposits indicate patterns of 

chaotic sedimentation with marine sediments resting adjacent to layers of terrestrial peat and twigs. In 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

several basins tsunami deposition was accompanied by erosion of underlying lake sediments followed by 

redeposition within the suite of tsunami sediments. However, the deposits varied greatly in short distances. 

Bondevik et al. (1997) observed that lake sediment cores of tsunami deposits sampled only 1m apart are 

markedly different, and attributed this variability to the complicated hydrodynamic behaviour of the tsunami 

due to local variations in lake bathymetry. 

In the Shetland Islands the Storegga tsunamigenic deposit is simply characterized as a sandy layer 

in peat (Bondevik et al., 2003). However, more recent work by Bondevik et al. (2005) and Dawson et al. 

(2006) also detected two other tsunamigenic units that were attributed to more recent submarine slides. One 

of these events, detected in Basta Voe and dated of 1500 years BP was characterized as a fine-medium 

sandy unit sandwiched in peat, with frequent bimodal distribution and with clear marine 

micropalaeontological assemblage. In two other lakes deposits from another tsunami dated to ca. 5500 cal 

yr BP were also detected. The sediment facies were similar to those of the Storegga tsunami. 

In the Faroe Islands the tsunamigenic unit associated with the Storegga slide was recognized in a 

coastal lake situated 4m above msl on the island of Suouroy (Grauert et al., 2001). The authors identified 

within the lagoonal stratigraphy a major erosional and redepositional event. The (re)deposited sediment 

ranges from sand and sandy gyttja with marine shell fragments and foraminifera, to gyttja with rip-up clasts, 

wood fragments and thin sand layers. Diatom analysis indicated that the deposit contained 5–8% full marine 

species, decreasing to 1–2% in the undisturbed lacustrine gyttja above. The tsunami waves deposited two 

generations of sand overlain by organic conglomerates, after which followed a unit of suspension material 

and normal lacustrine gyttja (Grauert et al., 2001). A 2.73m long sediment sequence from Loon Lake (East 

Greenland), located at 18m above msl, was recovered by Wagner et al. (2007). The sequence mainly 

consisted of fine grained homogeneous sediments, which were interrupted by a 0.72m thick sandy horizon 

with erosive basis and distinct fluctuations in the grain-size distribution. According to radiocarbon dates, this 

sandy horizon was deposited after 8500–8300 cal. yr BP and was interpreted as originated from the 

Storegga tsunami. 

Due to its geographical location the coast of Scotland is occasionally subjected to extreme storm 

events that can cause major erosion and, in some cases, transport and deposition of coarser material. One 

example of this was the Great Storm of 11th January of 2005 that caused extensive damage across the 

Scottish Outer Hebrides with severe impacts having occurred across South Uist and Benbecula (Dawson et 

al., 2007). The hurricane-force winds together with an intense storm surge resulted in significant change in 

coastal landscape along the entire western seabord and, in particular, on headlands (Angus and Rennie, 

2007). In general, severe erosion was focused along coastal areas located west of the roads that link North 

Uist and Benbecula, Benbecula and South Uist and South Uist and Eriskay. According to Dawson et al. 

(2007) the coastal response to the storm was complex. In some areas, coastal dunes were subject to 

significant retreat. In other areas deposition of shingle and even boulders was observed. Sand drift and its 

association with storms (storminess) have also been identified in the Outer Hebrides. (Dawson et al., 2004)

demonstrated a concentration of aeolian activity between AD 1500 and 1700. Inland-tapering sand units 

were detected within marshland areas. The inland extent of each sand unit was radiocarbon dated and the 

units were collectively interpreted as a proxy for past coastal storminess. The data appeared to indicate that 

for the study sites investigated, the majority of the sand units were produced during episodes of climate 

deterioration, both prior to and after the well-known period of Medieval warmth (Dawson et al., 2004). In the 

Shetland Islands and in Scotland boulders transported by major storms have been described and this matter 

has been intensely debated (e.g. Williams and Hall, 2004; Hall et al., 2006; Hansom et al., 2008). 

 

2.5.3. Indonesia 

Although tsunami sedimentation has been studied abundantly in the Indonesian archipelago, 

including the events of 1883 - Krakatoa (van der Bergh et al., 2003), 1992 -  Flores (Minoura et al., 1997; Shi 

et al., 1995; Dawon et al., 1996), 1994 - Java (Dawson et al., 1996) and 1998 - Papua New Guinea 

(Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003), after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami an astonishing number of papers 

focusing in the sedimentary evidences and consequences of this event in Indonesia were published. The 

island of Sumatra was strongly affected by this event and several sedimentological studies were conducted 

(e.g. Moore et al., 2006; Paris et al., 2007; Meilianda et al., 2007; Monecke et al., 2008; Paris et al., 2009; 

Paris et al., 2010a; Paris et al., 2010b; Wassmer et al., 2010, Spiske et al., 2010). Immediately after the 

Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 an International Tsunami Survey team was assembled and conducted 

sedimentary research in several locations in Sumatra (Figure 2.5).

A progression from intense near coast erosion, deposition of sediment inland, to deposition of 

sediment and debris near the landward edge of inundation was observed in the area located south of Lhok 

Nga and north of Leupung (Moore et al., 2006). Along the coastline the tsunami removed the ca. 10m wide 

beach and also removed all soil present within at least 20m of the shoreline, exposing the roots of trees that 

withstood the flow and scouring into underlying beach rock (Moore et al., 2006). About 50 to 200m from the 

beach, sand was deposited in a continuous layer about 10cm thick. From about 200m from shore inland to 

the edge of inundation (up to about 450m from shore), debris such as tree trunks and the contents of houses 

were observed as an increasingly large part of the deposit (Moore et al., 2006). The tsunami deposit in this 

area was characterized as a pinkish grey, poorly sorted coarse to very coarse sand, becoming medium sand 

landward (Moore et al., 2006). The tsunami unit showed evidence of having multiple sources, including a 

source near the present shoreface, a subtidal source, and possibly an inland source (Moore et al., 2006). 

In nearby Lhok Nga the geomorphologic impact of the tsunami was evidenced by severe coastal 

erosion (Paris et al., 2009). The upper limit of destruction appeared as a continuous trimline at 20-30m 

above mean sea level and run-up exceeded 50m at the southern point of the bay (Labuhan Point: Paris et 

al., 2007). The erosional imprints of the tsunami extend to 500m inland and exceeded 2 km landward along 

the river beds (Paris et al., 2007, 2010b). Paris et al. (2007) described the tsunami deposits in Lhok Nga as 

coarse to medium greyish to yellowish sands, showing important variations in thickness, grain-size and 

vertical trends. The deposits overlaid brown sandy soils, dune sands or beach-rock near the coast, reddish 

sands in the rivers, and a dark brown silty soil in the rice paddies. 

According to Paris et al. (2007) the contact between the tsunami deposits and the buried soil was 

abrupt or erosional when developed over soft material such as sand. The thickness of the tsunami deposits 

varied and reached maxima in the topographic lows: 44cm in a small bay near Labuhan, 52cm in a lagoon 

between Lampuuk and Lhok Nga, 70cm between the razed dunes of Lampuuk, and 82cm flanked on a sand 

cliff near the cement factory. Paris et al. (2007) concluded that 75% of the 26 cross-sections displayed 

stratification into distinct layers, the number of which ranged between 7 and 15. The lower part of the 

sequence was usually coarse and massive whereas the upper part was usually finer and sometimes 

laminated by multiple pulses of deposition. Discontinuous thin mud lines were often observed in cross 

section intercalated between the main layers (Paris et al., 2007). The same authors observed that the quartz 

grains were mostly sub-angular to sub-rounded, like those sampled from the present-day beach. The 

microfaunas identified were typical of a shallow marine environment (Paris et al., 2007). The grain-size 

distribution observed along Lampuuk was characterised by two successive sequences of landward fining 

layers. In Lhok Nga, it was also observed that the abundance of nannoliths in the 2004 tsunami deposits 

decreased landward and upward, despite variations due to successive erosion/sedimentation phases by 

successive waves and to topographical effects (Paris et al., 2010a). 

In the same location, boulder transport and deposition was also observed during the 2004 Indian 

Ocean tsunami. The tsunamigenic waves were able to detach and transport coral boulders in excess of 10t 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

52 
 

over 500–700m and megaclasts of the platform in excess of 85t over a few metres although no landward 

decrease in size was observed (Paris et al., 2009). The authors concluded that the spatial and size 

distributions of tsunami boulder deposits mostly depend on the location and characteristics of their source 

(coral reef, beach rock, platform, dams), together with clast-clast and clast-surface interference during 

transport (Paris et al., 2009). An estimation of the volume of sediments deposited in Lhok Nga by the 2004 

Indian Ocean tsunami suggested that more than 75% of the tsunami deposits came from nearshore (Paris et 

al., 2009), which is in contrast with the established predominant source of the sandy deposits at the same 

location (Paris et al., 2007). The coincidence of different size modes, from boulders to fine sands suggests 

that the whole of the material was not transported in suspension, but rather through a combination of rolling, 

saltation and suspension. In Banda Aceh coastal marshes, the record of tsunamigenic deposits was 

extended backward in time due to the recognition of two sand layers deposited after AD 1290-1400 and AD 

780-990 (Monecke et al., 2008).

3. Study areas 

3.1. Algarve 

3.1.1.  Geographical and Geological setting 

Tsunami events in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula are a consequence of the 

compressive tectonic environment of the Ibero-Maghrebian area (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 

2001; Gutscher et al., 2006), the transcurrent motion along the Gloria Fault and surrounding area 

(Kaabouben et al., 2008) or the effect of other distant seismic sources (i.e. Azores or Grand Banks) (Baptista 

and Miranda, 2009) (Figure 3.1). The oldest tsunami event often considered in Portuguese earthquake 

catalogues is dated from 60 BC (Baptista and Miranda, 2009). In fact, the Iberian Peninsula has low 

frequency of tsunamis although the largest tsunami that affected the Atlantic coasts of Europe in historical 

times was the well-known AD 1755 tsunami, which followed the Lisbon earthquake. In many coastal regions 

of Portugal and SW Spain, the destructive effects of the AD 1755 tsunami were more disastrous than the 

direct effects of the earthquake. The first three waves of the tsunami were particularly destructive along the 

west and south coasts of Portugal (Oliveira, 2005). After the earthquake the tsunami quickly affected the 

coasts of Iberia and Morrocco, reaching Cape Saint Vincent in 15 minutes, Lisbon in 30 minutes, Cadiz in 78 

minutes, Huelva in 50 minutes, Oporto in one hour, Madeira in 90 minutes and Safi in 30 minutes, (Baptista 

et al., 1998). The effects of the tsunami were felt over the Atlantic. Detailed historical records of the AD 1755 

events have been previously summarized by several authors (e.g. Silva Lopes, 1841; Pereira de Sousa, 

1919; Oliveira, 2005; Oliveira, 2008). The driving mechanisms, sources (and thus return period) of large 

magnitude earthquakes and tsunami generated in the Iberian region have been extensive challenged in 

recent years, following the conclusion that the events of AD 1755 and AD 1969 have been sourced in 

different areas of the SW Iberian margin. However, the major tsunamigenic threat for the Atlantic coast of 

Iberia is the earthquake activity associated with the Azores-Gibraltar plate boundary and neotectonic and 

gravity-induced sea-floor activity offshore the Gulf of Cadiz.

The Algarve coast presents a geological and morphological asymmetry, mainly due to the 

occurrence of different wave regimes and to the nature and structural features of the outcropping lithologies. 

The coastline can be divided into two different areas (i.e. west coast and the south facing coast), due to the 

geomorphological contrast, the south coast can be further subdivided into windward and leeward coastal 

sectors. In this study only the windward sector will be addressed. 

The windward coast has developed in resistant Mesozoic limestone, dolomite and marl and softer Miocenic 

limestone, detrital limestone and siltstone. Both resistant and softer lithologies form cliffs with steep slopes 

(Figure 3.2). Cliffs with Jurassic substrate sometimes plunge directly to the ocean whereas Tertiary rocks 

usually present cliffs with its toe exhibiting narrow beaches or platforms, both intertidal and subtidal. The 

windward coast of Algarve is limited to the west by the Cape S. Vicente and to the east by the Ancão beach 

(Figure 3.2). The existent morphology in the western part of the windward sector is a consequence of the 

tectonics, represented by numerous faults with a NNE-SSW main direction, and by alongshore succession 

of different lithologies, with different resistances to erosion, forming an irregular coastline with numerous 

headlands and narrow embayments. In this sector, the coastline is characterized by rocky cliffs, with heights 

varying between 40m and 110m above msl, interrupted by small beaches. The eastern sector of this 

windward coast presents a coastline with well-developed estuaries and bays separated by cliffs with heights 

varying between 20m and 50m above msl. The rivers and streams that flow in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic 

rocks display poorly developed catchment areas inland and alluvial plains, which are essentially composed 

of mud that resulted from the weathering and erosion of limestones and Flysch outcropping in the 

watershed. In the eastern sector of the windward coast the prevailing lithologies (i.e marls and clastic 

carbonate Miocene rocks) contribute to the cliffy appearance of the coastline. According to Andrade (1990), 

the cliffs fringe forms a marine-cut costal platform essentially affecting Miocene carbonated rock. This 

surface is at an average height of 45m though gently sloping to SE, and is heavily karstified. The sector 

located to the east of Olhos de Água and west of the Ancão beach is characterized by a narrow beach 

backed by a linear cliff cut in Pliocene-Pleistocene soft sand and gravel. The cliffs frequently collapse, and 

show the highest erosion and retreat rates found in the Algarve (Andrade, 1990). The drainage system 

existing in this section of the coastline, presents mainly small streams that extend to a maximum of 4 km 

inland, draining the Pliocene-Pleistocene bedrock, with the exception of Quarteira and Carcavai streams 

(Figure 3.2), which extend further inland, presenting well developed catchment areas and draining the entire 

Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequence.

3.1.2.  Oceanography 

 In order to recognize extreme marine inundations it is important to assess the wave regime, 

oceanographic conditions, tide levels and other predominant oceanographic factors. 

In 1979, the Instituto Hidrográfico was able to characterize the wave regime in the Portuguese 

coasts based in non-directional data gathered in several measuring stations. At a later stage the deployment 

of offshore buoys in Faro, Sines, Figueira da Foz and Leixões allowed the collection of wave data with a 10 

minute frequency. Costa et al. (2001) based in the data collected by the above mentioned buoys was able to 

characterize the mean wave conditions for Figueira da Foz, Sines and Faro. They were able to conclude that 

the annual average period was 5-7s (Figueira da Foz – 6.6s; Sines - 7.2s; Faro -4.7s). The most common 

peak values were observed between 9-13s (Figueira da Foz - 11.4s; Sines – 10.8s; Faro – 8.2s). In the 

south coast of Portugal 52% of the observations correspond to a W direction, with a slight increase in the 

winter (Costa et al., 2001). During the summer the wave direction tend to rotate to the north while the SW 

and WSW directions occur more typical during the winter. 

The wave regime is of low energy, with mean annual significant wave height (Hs) &amp;lt;1m and storms 

are essentially related with westerlies and west-northwest deep water waves approaching from the Atlantic. 

The storm wave regime is discussed in a report by LNEC (1987), using a combination of buoy and 

hindcasted data (Table 3.1). 

The maximum astronomical high tide levels, in the Algarve, are about 1.80m above mean sea level 

and during extreme spring tides the high tide level may slightly exceed 2m above msl (Hindson and 

Andrade, 1999). The tidal range is approximately 2.1m and ca. 3m during spring tides, and the maximum 

reported elevations reached by sea-level in spring high tide during intense storms reflect just a small 

contribution of storm surge to the observed extreme levels: about 2.15m above msl (cf. Esaguy, 1984) 

Furthermore, Taborda and Dias (1992), based in the study of 2 major storms (14th of February to 3rd March 

of 1978; 25th to 31st of December 1981) indicated that the storm surge caused a maximum elevation of the 

sea of 0.42m in Lagos.

Costa et al. (1994) studied storm events based in the data series yield by the buoy of Faro and analyzing the 

period between 1986 and 2001. Storm events were considered when the significant wave height was higher 

than 3m. According with this study the average of storm events per year is 9.3 in the winter and 0.6 in the 

summer. According with the Instituto Hidrográfico data, during the last decade (2000-2009) the maximum 

wave height (Hmax) measured by the deepwater buoy of Faro was approximately 12.5m while the maximum 

significant wave height (HMO) measured was 7.5m (December of 2000). Moreover, only in another occasion 

during the last decade (February 2003) the Hmax was above 10m. 

 

3.1.3. Salgados 

The Salgados lowland is located in the bay between Armação de Pêra and Galé (Figure 3.2 and 

3.3). This coast features a 6 km-long intermediate-reflective sand beach backed by a continuous, 3 to 17m-

high vegetated foredune (Figure 3.4), the latter covering resistant Pleistocene-Holocene aeolianite and 

beachrock (Moura et al., 2007). The continuity of the beach-dune system is interrupted by the ephemeral 

inlets of two infilled lagoons, which developed in relation with the outlet of intermitent streams: the 

Alcantarilha lagoon and stream, and the Salgados lagoon and Espiche stream, which drain, respectively, 

204 and 41km2 watersheds, mostly developed in Early Miocene limestone and Late Miocene siltstone and 

sandstone (Pinto and Teixeira, 2002) (Figure 3.2 and 3.5). The Salgados Lagoon extended across some 

1.5km2 but about half of this surface has been reclaimed and landfilled for a golf course. The remnant 

surface is a flat-floored depression 1.1 to 1.7m above mean sea level, collecting water and muddy sediment 

from the adjacent catchment and is usually flooded by about 1m of water.

3.1.4. Boca do Rio 

Boca do Rio is located between S. Vicente Cape and Lagos (Figure 3.2 and 3.6). It is a small flat-

floored and sediment filled lowland located within the otherwise high-cliff coastline of the western Algarve 

(Figure 3.7). The lowland area consists of a supratidal floodplain that is periodically subject to extensive river 

flooding by the Budens, Vale de Boi and Vale de Barão streams. These rivulets present a seasonal regime 

with strong variations in the flow rate between rainy winters and dryer summers. The Cretaceous limestone 

and marly limestone E-W orientated cliffs that limit the Boca do Rio beach to the east and to the west reach 

heights of ca. 70m above msl. The flat N-S orientated alluvial plain presents an average height of 1.7m 

above msl and reaching 3m above msl to the north of the plain. The area is separated from the sea by a 

storm gravel and sand ridge and by a rock spur that together forms a barrier to wave overtopping during 

storms (Hindson et al., 1996). A high dune at ca. 8-10m above msl existed in Boca do Rio at the time of the 

AD 1755 tsunami (Pereira de Sousa, 1919) but the natural system failed to rebuild a robust dune or beach 

since then (Oliveira et al., 2009). The beach is 200m long and 115m wide and the beach berm rests at 2.1m 

above msl. The drainage basin develops along ca. 80 km2 in Palaeozoic schist and greywacke, claystone, 

Triassic siltstone and sandstone, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous limestone and marls and Plio-Pleistocene 

sand and sandstone (Figure 3.8).

3.2. Shetland Islands 

3.2.1. Geographical and Geological setting 

Together Shetland and Orkney form the Scottish Northern Isles and are located in the North 

Atlantic, NE of Scotland Mainland. The main tsunamigenic risk in the northeast Atlantic is from submarine 

slides, which are more difficult to detect than earthquakes. There is no historical evidence for earthquakes 

larger than 5.4 ML (local magnitude) onshore. However, offshore seismicity, especially in the North Sea, is 

prone to larger events. 

The geology of Shetland is varied and rather complex, principally as a result of a large number of 

major north-south running faults, including the northward continuation of the Great Glen Fault (Figure 3.9). 

Shetland now forms an important link between the East Greenland, Scottish and Norwegian parts of the 

Caledonian Orogenic belt (Johnson et al., 1993). Like much of Scotland, the cover rocks of Shetland are 

supported by platform of Late Archean (2500-3000 Ma) Lewisian basement gneiss which is the northward 

extension of the Hebridean Craton. Historically, the Shetland metamorphic cover is called the East Mainland 

Succession with the Yell Sound Division (Moine) at its base, overlain by the Scatsta, Whiteness and Clift 

Hills Divisions (Dalradian) (Johnson et al., 1993). The Devonian sandstones of Orkney and Shetland were 

deposited in the Orcadian Basin, a low-lying area into which rivers from the Highlands to the west and south 

drained. During the last Ice Age an ice-cap covered Shetland but it was much thinner than that of the 

Scottish mainland. Evidence for the ice does exist in the form of glacial erratics and moraines. The last ice 

sheet left Shetland around 14,000 years ago, though a cold snap a few thousand years later brought about a 

return of glaciers, the last finally disappearing ca. 10,000 years ago. The outline of Shetland at the end of the 

Ice Age was very different from today, sea levels being around 100m lower due to the amount of water 

locked up in the ice (Johnson et al., 1993). However, since then, melting ice has caused sea levels to rise 

and the Shetland landmass has also been depressed as the massive weight of the ice over the continental 

landmass to the east was removed. Sea levels have therefore risen gradually over the past 14,000 years 

and by the time the first Mesolithic gatherers arrived 6,000 or 7,000 years ago it was around 9 metres below 

current levels – peat has been found at this level at this period on the Unst coast (Johnson et al., 1993). The 

recent submergence of Shetland is apparent in the fine detail of its coastline. Peat formerly developed on 

boggy surfaces above sea level is now often found at or below sea level and sometimes buried beneath 

boulder and gravel beaches. The coastal edges of Shetland few sandy coastlines frequently take the form of 

a small, sandy cliff, suggesting progressive erosion.

In the words of Flinn (1977), "Shetland is a partly drowned range of hills rising rather sharply from a 

depth of about 82m below present sea level". The submergence of the archipelago has had a profound 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

effect on coastal processes, allowing deep water waves to approach parts of the outer coastline directly and 

without breaking and the progressive reworking of depositional features on the middle and inner coasts. The 

outer coast displays spectacular cliff scenery, reflecting rapid erosion along one of the highest energy 

coastlines in the world. The middle coast is much more sheltered and includes the anchorages of Sullom 

Voe and Bressay Sound, where deep water fills drowned glacial valleys. The sands and gravels along the 

inner coast are highly mobile, with beaches, spits and bars adapting to sea level rise and being reworked 

during major storms. 

 

3.2.2.  Oceanography 

Shetland is one of the stormiest places in Europe. Due to its geographical location the Shetland 

islands are very exposed to westerly gales from the North Atlantic.The atmospheric turbulence associated 

with the development of mid-latitude cyclones arises principally from the interaction of cold polar air with 

warmer air from lower latitudes. The collision of air masses of contrasting temperature and density results in 

the development of frontal weather with the air mass boundaries represented respectively by warm, cold and 

occluded fronts. These atmospheric processes place Shetland within the North Atlantic storm track (Dawson 

et al., 2011). During winter, this results in the passage of numerous frontal cyclones, the occurrence of high 

winds and associated spells of high rainfall. During other periods, the Atlantic storm track is displaced either 

to the north, or more commonly to the south, of the northeast North Atlantic (Dawson et al., 2011). Such 

changes are normally associated with a change in the position of the jet stream in the upper atmosphere. 

When this type of circulation occurs (e.g. winter of 2009?10), the prevailing SW airstream can be replaced 

by a northerly and NE airflow (Dawson et al., 2011). When the type of synoptic climate occurs, Shetland 

tends to experience long periods of extremely cold weather. During the summer months, the vigour of 

atmospheric circulation is reduced. Storms are less frequent and are commonly replaced by anticyclonic 

circulation that is associated with spells of fine weather. Cyclones also develop during summer but, when 

they occur, are typically less intense and associated with much lower wind velocities than during winter 

(Dawson et al., 2011). 

Information on wave data is limited for Shetland waters. Data is available for the wave buoys 

operated by the UK Met Office (Station 64045-K5 Buoy and station 64046- K7 wave buoy) and from a tide 

gauge in the Shetland capital (Lerwick). The tidal range in Shetland is moderate. There is a tide gauge in 

Lerwick Harbour, operated by Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory. Maxima data from Jan 1959 to Oct 

2000 shows that the highest recorded level in this series is 1.774m (above local ordnance datum from 

Lerwick) in January 1993 (Crichton, 2003). Average wave heights are around 3m. By 2080, the average 

could be around 4m, and maximum offshore wave heights could be as high as ten metres (Dawson et al., 

2001). Storm surges around mainland Scotland have been predicted to become around 3 to 4m by 2080, 

and similar levels can perhaps be assumed in Shetland (Crichton, 2003). In the period of 1997-2009 the 

measured Hs varied between 2.4 to 2.6m the maximum values obtained where ca. 10m (Dawson et al., 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

2011). The wave period for the same time interval varied between 8 and 12s (in Lerwick). For Lerwick the 

strongest winds are associated with southerly, south-westerly and westerly directions bringing wet air in from 

the Atlantic. The monthly averaged wind speed data for Lerwick shows temporal seasonal variability in wind 

speed, with a five year running mean suggesting a slight increase in wind speeds from 1972 – 2009. The 

annual average wind speeds (in Lerwick 15 knots/s) showed this trend more clearly Dawson et al. (2011). 

This is particularly evident in Lerwick for the years of 1957 – 1980. The lowest pressure recorded in Lerwick 

was 944.4 mb on the 25th December 1999 and the highest 1094 mb on the 7th of December 1997 (Dawson 

et al., 2011). Lerwick gale day frequencies increased during the period of 1957-2009 (less than 20 days in 

1987 to almost 80 days in 2007) (Dawson et al., 2011). 

Massive winter storms crash onto Shetland rocky coastline. The sea is an enormously powerful 

agent of change, especially when whipped up by the North Atlantic gales that can sweep Shetland, with 

gusts of over 277 km/h being recorded at Muckle Flugga lighthouse on 1st January 1992. In 1967 a wind of 

283 km/h was recorded at the radar dome on top of Saxa Vord. Enormous waves crash into the shores, 

eroding coastal outcrops of rock and creating the massive cliffs, with their caves, rock arches and inlets that 

are so much a feature of the Shetland coast. Fast-moving and rapidly-developing depressions in the 

northeast Atlantic generate exceptional wind speeds and a high-energy wave regime. Modelling of extreme 

waves in deep water at Schiehallion, 160 km west of Shetland and data from a wave buoy nearby suggest 

that wave heights of 20m occur about 100 times per year (BP Exploration, 1995). Mathematical and physical 

modelling in a wave tank indicated that 20m high deepwater waves will generate breaking waves of a height 

roughly equivalent to the deepwater wave height on the cliff faces at The Grind (Hansom et al., 2008), 

implying that the entire cliff top at 15–22m may be inundated during storms. 

 

3.2.3. Voe of Scatsta 

A small inlet within Sullom Voe on the north coast of the Shetland Mainland, the Voe of Scatsta lies 

between Scatsta Ness and Sella Ness (Figure 3.10 and 3.11). Sullom Voe lies on the southern shore of Yell 

Sound in Mainland Shetland. The site encompasses Gluss Voe, Sullom Voe, Orka Voe and several small 

subsidiary arms and embayments including Voxter, Scatsta and Garths Voes and the Bight of Haggrister 

(Figure 3.10). A semi-enclosed body of water at the head of the Voe of Scatsta, within Sullom Voe on the N 

coast of the Shetland Mainland, the Houb of Scatsta lies immediately to the northeast of Scatsta Airport 

(Figure 3.11).

Figure 3.10 – Geographical location of Voe of Scatsta. 

 

The shores at the entrances to Sullom Voe are moderately exposed to wave action whereas 

extremely sheltered conditions prevail towards the head of Sullom Voe and within the houbs. The shores of 

Sullom Voe, especially in the more exposed outer regions, are predominantly of bedrock and with varying 

slope. Inner, more sheltered, rocky shores generally vary from gently sloping bedrock to boulder and mixed 

cobble/sediment but there are also regions of steep cliff and boulder covered shores especially at the head 

of Sullom Voe. Significant areas of intertidal sediments only occur at the heads of Gluss, Garths, Scatsta 

and Voxter Voes, and around the spit and inside the Houbs of Fugla Ness and Scatsta (Figure 3.10). 

Smaller patches of intertidal sediments (coarse sands/gravel) occur sporadically around the region. The 

middle region of Sullom Voe is more sheltered and is a more varied coastline, indented in places by small 

voes and houbs/lagoons. Intertidal sediments are confined to the houbs and the heads of Gluss, Garths, 

Scatsta and Voxter Voes. These sediments are variable and poorly sorted, consisting mainly of coarse sand, 

gravel, shell debris and peat fragments.

3.3. Hebrides Islands 

3.3.1. Geographical and Geological setting 

The Outer Hebrides is a chain of islands, 210 km long, in the northwest of mainland Scotland. Sixty 

five islands compose the archipelago, with a combined coastline of 2500 km. The topography of the islands 

is characterized by low lying lands on the west coast and the Highlands with mountains, cliffs, fjords and 

skerries (rising to heights locally in excess of 200m). Here, the coast is fringed by a largely stabilised dune 

system consisting of a single low ridge seaward and a gently sloping surface andward, where the system 

ends amidst peat areas, rocky outcrops and many small lochs (Dawson et al., 2004). The sand areas are 

known locally as machair, derived from the Gaelic word for extensive beach or plain and which describes a 

low-lying, grass-dominated coastal plain composed of calcareous sand with calcium carbonate content up to 

ca. 80% (Ritchie and Whittington, 1994). Machair is present in the Hebrides extending much of the whole 

length of the islands of Berneray, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra and up to 2 km inland. Many 

of the machair systems in the Outer Hebrides are protected by a dune ridge, although there are sections of 

coastline where, due to erosion, this has been lost (Dawson et al., 2004). It is generally considered to have 

formed as a result of aeolian processes and has distinctive dune morphology (e.g. Ritchie, 1979). 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

71 
 

Notwithstanding the apparent uniformity of the machair surface, exposures in the dune face to seaward 

disclose soil and peat horizons which reflect episodes of stability and imply a complex evolution. 

Most of the Outer Hebrides is comprised of Lewisian gneiss (Figure 3.12), that forms an upstanding 

basement high that has a discrete faulted eastern margin against Mesozoic and earlier Torridonian 

sedimentary basins in the Minches (Fettes et al., 1992). On their western side lies an extensive shallow 

shelf, termed the Outer Hebrides Platform with Lewisian gneiss at or near the bedrock surface. It extends 

west of the Uists for some 60 to 70 km. The geology of the Outer Hebrides is dominated by Archaean and 

Proterozoic Lewisian gneisses, analogous in age with rocks forming the Caledonian foreland of mainland 

Scotland, but separated from them by sediment filled Mesozoic half-graben beneath the Minch (Fettes et al., 

1992). Part of this is exposed as the Stornoway beds (near the town of Stornoway in Lewis), the only non- 

Lewisian rocks in the Hebrides (Fettes et al., 1992). Classically two major periods of tectonic and 

metamorphic activity has been recognized - Scourian and Laxfordian. The main elements of the gneiss 

complex were formed during the Scourian. Originally granodioritic, tonalitic and basaltic intrusions emplaced 

at mid or lower crustal levels were subjected to deformation and metamorphism (gneiss formation) between 

3100 Ma and 2500 Ma. Granite bodies and microdiorite sheets were intruded near the end of the Archaean 

in what is termed the late Scourian at around 2600 Ma (Fettes et al., 1992). There followed the widespread 

intrusion of the ‘Younger Basic’ suite of dolerite and basalt dykes and lenticular sheets in the 

Palaeoproterozoic at around 2400 Ma. Significant later accretion of possibly arc-related metasedimentary 

and metavolcanic rocks and intrusion of the South Harris Igneous Complex occurred at around 1880 Ma. 

The gneisses and earlier igneous bodies were reworked significantly between 1850 Ma and 1600 Ma, during 

the Laxfordian event, and it is the resultant Laxfordian folds, fabrics and metamorphic mineralogy that 

dominate the Lewisian rocks of the Outer Hebrides (Fettes et al., 1992). 

The most obvious major structure of the Outer Isles is the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone, a gently 

ESE-dipping, structure with evidence of polyphase compressional, strike slip and extensional displacement, 

a major eastward dipping thrust zone, marked by pseudotachylite, cataclasite and brecciated 'mashed 

gneiss' (Fettes et al., 1992). The extensive machair, sand dunes, sandy beaches and inter-tidal sand flats, 

are a particularly outstanding feature of the coastal geomorphology of the area. At the end of the last 

glaciation (Late Devensian) the pre-machair surface was covered by glacially scoured substrate with 

marshes and lochs occupying the depressions. With the subsequent rise in sea level during Holocene 

glacially derived sands from offshore were mobilised and mixed with shell debris. This material was 

reworked into coastal ridges and moved onshore overriding pre-existing lacustrine and organic deposits 

(Ritchie, 1985).

3.3.2. Oceanography 

The wave climate of the Outer Hebrides is severely depth limited. The offshore platform to the west 

of the Outer Hebrides is a relic of the old coastal plains which have been flooded since Neolithic times 

(4000-2000 BC). This eroded land provides a gently sloping platform far out to sea which forces incoming 

waves to shoal and lose energy before breaking on the coastline. During a storm or particularly high tide 

event wave heights may increase to be greater than normally anticipated owing to the increased depth of 

nearshore water (and consequently the decreased shoaling effect) (Richard and Phipps, 2007). 

Fortnum (1981) compiled wave data from March 1976 to February 1978 at 57º18’ N, 7º38’ W at 

approximately 15 km west of the island of South Uist, where the water depth is about 42m. Predominant 

measured wind directions were westerly, north and south-westerly winds, while Hs varied from 1.5 to 2m 

(corresponding to 17.7% of the total). Wave periods lay between 2.5 and 12.5s, while the most frequently 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

73 
 

occurring values were 6.0-6.5s (corresponding to 14.1% of the total). The wave power measured during the 

two year period of observation was of approximately 585 kWh/m. 

There are few tidal gauges or wave rider buoys in the Western Isles and thus tides and extreme 

water level heights were extrapolated by Richard and Phipps (2007) from nearby ports such as Stornoway, 

Ullapool, Tobermory and Kinlochbervie (Table 3.3). The tidal regime in the Hebrides is semi-diurnal with a 

range of up to five metres.

The coastline of the Western Isles is more prone to gales and similar storms than most of the coast 

of Europe. Mean monthly wind speeds range from about 12 knots in July/August to about 16 knots  in 

December/January, though daily mean wind speed over 30 knots  with gusts in excess of 50 knots  are not 

uncommon, even occasionally during the summer months. The highest gust recorded at Stornoway in recent 

years was 98 knots in February 1962 (Contaminated Land: Implementation of Part IIA of the Environmental 

Protection Act, 2006). Atlantic storms are frequent, with severe events occurring at intervals. An 

extraordinary storm occurred in 2005 with deadly consequences and significant material losses. On 11th 

January 2005, the islands and much of the west coast of Scotland were hit by the most severe storm in living 

memory. Hurricane force winds ripped roofs from houses; roads, causeways and harbours connecting the 

low-lying islands were destroyed; fishing boats were wrecked; and livestock drowned. The wave power to 

the west of the Outer Hebrides is at the present moment being exploited as an important renewable energy 

resource. 

 

3.3.3. Stoneybridge 

South Uist is the second largest of the islands in the Western Isles, measuring some 22 miles north 

to south and 7 miles from east to west. The geography is divided into a series of north-south strips, each 

running the length of the island (Figure 3.12). The west coast faces onto the Atlantic and comprises around 

20 miles of beach, broken only by a headland at the half-way point. The South Uist coastline between 

Ardivachar Point and Stoneybridge (Figure 3.13) is an exposed Atlantic coastline subject to on-going 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

74 
 

submergence. The Stoneybridge to Ardivachar (ca. 8 miles north of Stoneybridge) beach and machair 

system likely responded to Holocene sea level and sediment supply constraints in the same way as other 

machair systems in the Western Isles and were first developed sometime in the early to mid-Holocene 

before about 6500 years BP (Hansom and Angus, 2001). Stoneybridge is located on the west coast of South 

Uist (Figure 3.13). The beach is sandy, with a shingle ridge that has been formed into an artificial knife edge 

shape (Figure 3.14). The area behind the ridge is machair, which slopes gently downwards (Richard and 

Phipps, 2007). The beach that extends between two outcrops of highly resistant Lewisian gneiss at 

Ardivachar and at Stoneybridge is effectively a single system broken only by the rocky outcrops of and by 

the exit of the Howmore River. The river exit is characterized by several sand-bars and by localized 

backshore accretion with embryo dune formation. Seepage of ground water from the landward surfaces 

seasonally affects the beach so that the higher water-tables of winter intersect the gravels of the backshore 

storm ridge. Such impounding of the winter water table has profound geomorphological and ecological 

consequences, since the low-lying parts of the machair and dunes landward remain flooded to depths of up 

to 0.5m for up to five months of the year (Ritchie, 1971). The backshore ridge is affected by storm wave 

activity and wave-transported gravels are found up to 50m inland flooring the erosion and deflation hollows 

in the dunes behind. To the south, near Stoneybridge, the backing dune and machair zone disappears and 

is replaced by a broad-crested coarse gravel ridge that reaches up to 10m above mean sea level and up to 

50m wide (Ritchie, 1971). Under storm conditions the ridge is subject to roll-over of the constituent gravels 

that encroach into the area of marsh and lochs on the landward side.

3.4. Sumatra 

3.4.1. Geographical and Geological setting 

Indonesia is an immense archipelago of more than 18,000 islands extending over 5000 km from 

east to west between 95° and 141° E, and crossing the equator from 6° N to 11° S. It is situated at the 

boundaries of three major plates: Eurasia, India-Australia, and Pacific-Philippine Sea. In western Indonesia, 

the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian plates is the Sunda Trench (Figure 3.15). Parallel to this in 

Sumatra is the right-lateral strike-slip Sumatran Fault, which results from the partitioning of oblique plate 

convergence into normal convergence at the trench and trench-parallel movement further north. Most active 

deformation in Sumatra occurs between the trench and the Sumatran fault. The subduction zones are mainly 

well defined by seismicity extending to depths of about 600 km and by volcanoes (95 volcanoes have 

erupted since AD 1500). The Indonesian archipelago is located in one of the most tsunami-prone regions in 

the world and has been affected by several important and destructive tsunami events caused by different 

geological phenomena (i.e. volcanism- AD 1883 Krakatoa eruption; earthquake- 2004 Indian Ocean; 

submarine landslide: 1998 Papua New Guinea). 

 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

Figure 3.15 - Main geographical features of SE Asia (adapted from Hall, 2002). 

 

Sumatra represents the geological continuation of the Malay Peninsula and contains extensive 

outcrops of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks (Figure 3.16). In western Sumatra there are Paleozoic sediments 

that range in age from Carboniferous to Triassic and Permian volcanic rocks (Hall, 2009). In contrast, in 

eastern Sumatra, Carboniferous sediments include pebbly mudstones interpreted as diamictites that formed 

in a glacio-marine setting. The Mesozoic sedimentary record is very limited but suggests that much of 

Sundaland (i.e. geographical area that encompasses the Sunda trench, Java, Sumatra, Borneo), including 

most of its Indonesian margin, was emergent. Isotopic age-estimation in Sumatra indicates that there were 

several episodes of granite magmatism, interpreted to have occurred at an Andean-type margin, during the 

Jurassic and Cretaceous. Marine sedimentary rocks were deposited in an intra-oceanic arc that collided with 

the Sumatran margin in the Middle Cretaceous (Hall, 2009). The collision added arc and ophiolitic rocks to 

the southern margin of Sumatra. Cenozoic rocks were deposited in sedimentary basins in and around 

Sundaland. There are products of volcanic activity at subduction margins, and there are ophiolites, arc rocks 

and Australian continental crust added during collision. Little is known of the Late Cretaceous and 

Paleocene because of the paucity of rocks of this age (Hall, 2009). From Sumatra to Sulawesi, the southern 

part of Sundaland was probably mostly emergent during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic, and there 

was widespread erosion; the oldest Cenozoic rocks typically rest unconformably on Cretaceous or older 

rocks. In the Java–Sulawesi sector of the Sunda arc, volcanism greatly diminished during the Early and 

Middle Miocene, although northward subduction continued (Hall, 2009). The decline in magmatism resulted 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

from Australian collision in eastern Indonesia, causing rotation of Borneo and Java. Northward movement of 

the subduction zone prevented replenishment of the upper mantle source until rotation ceased in the late 

Middle Miocene. Then, about 10 million years ago, volcanic activity resumed in abundance along the Sunda 

arc from Java eastward. Since the Late Miocene, there has been thrusting and contractional deformation in 

Sumatra and Java related to arrival of buoyant features at the trench, or increased coupling between the 

overriding and downgoing plates (Hall, 2009). Both islands have been elevated above sea level in the last 

few million years. The Pliocene (Late Miocene?) wrench tectonics resulted in uplift along the Barisan 

Mountains in Sumatra midlands and separated the North Sumatra Basin from the forearc region including 

the Simeulue Basin. This was followed by formation of the Mentawai Fault in the Pliocene – Pleistocene that 

offsets the western flank of the basin and overprints the accretionary prism. Clastic sedimentation with shelf 

progradation and deposition of pelagic turbidites in the deep basins has continued since the Late Miocene to 

present day (Hall, 2009).

3.4.2.  Oceanography 

With the second largest coastline in the world, Indonesia has remarkably little hard information 

about the coastal waves that influence the shoreline and the coastal activities offshore and onshore. Reliable 

wave measurements over long periods of time are missing. Such data are of much importance to determine 

morphological changes (by natural or human causes) and to determine hazards from extreme wave 

situations caused by storms. The Indonesian Seas lie at the western edge of the Pacific trade wind belt 

where the persistent westerly directed wind stresses pile water up against the boundary. As a result, the 

annual mean sea-surface elevations are as much as 0.20m higher at the Pacific entrances to the 

archipelago south of the Philippines than in the Indian Ocean south of Java. The south-east Asian monsoon 

brings strong east winds across the archipelago from May to early September and west wind- from 

November to March. 

The only available wave regime data for Sumatra was presented by Meilianda et al. (2010). The 

authors derived the wave climate of the Banda Aceh (Sumatra) coast from eleven-year daily wind data 

records from 1995 to 2005. The wind data were recorded by the Department of Meteorology and 

Geophysics in Banda Aceh, and subsequently translated into statistical wave heights and periods as 

functions of wind velocity, duration and fetch (CERC, 1992). About 53% of the waves approach the coast 

with a significant wave height of 1.0m with a period of 3s, which was influenced by the southwest monsoon 

between April and September. During the northeast monsoon between October and March, 30% of the 

waves were approaching from the northeast also with a significant wave height of 1.0m and a period of 4.5s. 

These numbers show that the northwest coast of Banda Aceh is typically a low energy coast. 

 

3.4.3. Lhok Nga 

The Lhok Nga Bay is a flat 5 km large coastal embayment (25 km²) opened to the west and 

delimited by calcareous steep slopes (Figure 3.17). The coast prior to the 2004 tsunami appeared as a 

continuous beach, breached by small estuaries during the wet season. Bathymetry off Lhok Nga displays a 

20 km large continental shelf that is capable of providing great volumes of sediments (Paris et al., 2010b). 

The main fringing reefs are located between Lampuuk and the Lhok Nga River (Paris et al., 2007). The 

lowest areas correspond to lagoons, swamps and rice crops. Small hills and hummocky terrains refer to 

dunes, beach ridges and palaeo-dunes reaching 15m above msl (e.g., Lampuuk, Lam Lho). In the southern 

part of the bay, the coastal morphology becomes more contrasted, especially south of the Lampuuk harbour, 

where the coast shows alternating cliffs and flat crescent-shaped bays and creeks.

In Lhok Nga, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami waves were almost 30m high and run-ups reached 50m 

above msl (Lavigne et al., 2009). Eyewitnesses reported 10 to 12 waves, the second and third ones being 

the highest. Both inflow and outflow produced extensive erosion, sediment transport and deposition until 5 

km inland (Paris et al., 2009). The erosional imprints of the tsunami extend to 500m from the shoreline and 

exceed 2 km along the river beds. The most eroded coasts were tangent to the tsunami wave train, which 

came from the southwest (Figure 3.18).

4. Methodology 

In order to retrieve and analyse the sediment samples necessary to fulfil the objectives of this thesis 

a wide range of techniques was used. The proxies used are regularly applied to extreme marine inundations 

sedimentological studies. The textural analysis (grain-size, percentage of carbonates and organic matter; 

and morphoscopy), microtextural characterization and mineralogical studies of the deposits and source 

material are commonly used in the establishment of sedimentary provenance and in the characterization of 

the deposit. In order to constrain the age of deposition of the units studied several age-estimation techniques 

were used (OSL, radiocarbon, 210Pb and 137Cs). These techniques are also frequently applied to the study of 

Holocene extreme marine inundations and are universally used to directly date the tsunamigenic units or to 

obtain an age for them by dating the under and/or overlying units. 

A summary description of those techniques follows. 

 

4.1. Sampling and lithostratigraphic description 

Sediment samples were obtained excavating trenches and using box-corers on trench walls, or 

using a Livingstone corer, hand-operated Edelman or gauge augers and\or a Van der Staay suction corer. 

Visual description of sediment was conducted focusing on colour, lithology, texture, contact between units, 

erosional features and macrofossil content. Sampling locations were geroreferenced and their elevation 

above msl determined using a Zeiss Elta R 50 total station and one Leica DGPS RTK. Logs were plotted 

and correlations were established, when possible. Samples from present day sedimentary environments 

(e.g. nearshore, beach face, beach berm, dune, dune crest and alluvial plain) were collected by hand, using 

a dredge or directly retrieved by scuba diving (nearshore samples). 

 

4.2. Textural analysis 

4.2.1. Grain-size analysis 

Grain size analysis was conducted using a set of sieves at 0.5? interval. Initially, the bulk samples 

were washed with tap water and two fractions were separated (&gt;63µm and&amp;lt;63 µm) using a 4? mesh. The 

finer fraction (&lt;63µm) was analysed using the laser granulometer Malvern Mastersizer Hydro 2000 MU after 

deflocculating with 30% Sodium hexametaphosphate. The coarser fraction (&gt;63µm) was analysed 

exclusively through sieving, with exception of samples that had a coarser fraction weighting less than 10g. 

Results derived from both methods were assumed to be comparable. Statistical parameters of the grain size 

distribution (e.g. mean grain size, ?10, ?90, median, mode, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness) of the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

82 
 

samples were calculated using the graphic method (Folk and Ward, 1957) in the GranGraf software 

(Carvalho, 1998). A group of textural features were map-plotted to study their spatial distribution. This was 

done using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method of interpolation between sampling points in the 

ArcGis 9.3 environment. IDW is a method of interpolation that estimates cell values by weight-averaging the 

values of sample data points in the neighbourhood of each processing cell according to a non-linear function 

of distance (Davis, 1986). 

 

4.2.2. Calcium carbonate and organic matter content 

Calcium carbonate content – CaCO3 - (associated with bioclasts) was determined by measuring the 

volume of carbon dioxide evolved during reaction with hydrochloric acid using an Eijkelkamp calcimeter 

(Eijkelkamp, 2008). Organic matter content (OM) was determined by loss-on-ignition at 550º C during 2h 

following Bengtsson and Enell (1986). 

 

4.2.3. Morphoscopy 

Quartz-grain morphoscopy is the study leading to statistical determination of the different types of 

quartz grains in sandy deposits (Cailleux, 1942). The detailed observation of the surface of the grains (in 

terms of angularity, sphericity, shape, luster, corrosion, coatings), permits, in many cases, the establishment 

of the sedimentological agents that affected them prior or during transport or following immobilization. In 

order to establish tipology of quartz grains, samples from all study areas were observed and counted under 

the binocular microscope (Leica EZ4; 30x). The fractions (1 to 3?) were selected for observation since the 

smaller fractions require more magnification and the very coarse and very fine fractions tends to yield biased 

results on roundness. The observation and counting of, at least, 100 grains per sample was conducted. 

Grains from each sample were counted and 3 major groups (i.e. bioclasts, lithic and quartz) were identified. 

Bioclast fragments (eesencially Ca-carbonate, whole or fragmented shells and plant remains more or less 

fermented) and lithic grains were identified whenever possible. Quartz grains were further classified in terms 

of roundness and sphericity. The results of each sample were compiled and charts were produced. In some 

cases, other statistical analyses were conducted (e.g. principal component and cluster analysis) using 

Statistica 10 software. 

 

4.3. Microtextural analysis 

Grain surface microtexture (also named exoscopy - i.e. the micromorphological analysis of the 

surface of grains) is an analysis usually reserved for quartz particles of the dimension of sand and coarser 

particles. Many quartz sand grains develop microtextural features that can often be referred to specific 

transport processes or specific sedimentary environments. In order to recognize surface microtextures, a 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

83 
 

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to obtain high resolution images [JEOL JSM 5200 LV 

(Lisbon) and a JEOL JSM-5910 LV (Clermont-Ferrand)]. 

 

4.3.1. Laboratory procedure 

A minimum of 12 quartz grains per sample (maximum of 30 grains; mean of 16 grains) from the 1 to 

3? (125-500µm) size fraction were randomly selected under the binocular microscope and prepared for 

SEM analyses. This involved either mineralization with gold (Lisbon, FCUL) or metallization with carbon 

(Clermont-Ferrand University) of the particles. The grains were then taken to the SEM lab and photographs 

obtained. After this process, a visual analyse of each grain would follow focusing in a group of microtextural 

characteristics. 

 

4.3.2. Microtextural classification 

The microtextural classification was established based on selected references (e.g. Mahaney, 

2002) and in the author visual criteria. Each grain was characterized using a number of descriptive 

microtextural features revealed in SEM microphotographs (e.g. fresh surfaces, percussion marks, dissolution 

features, angularity and adhering particles). The microtextures (Figure 4.1) can be characterized as follows: 

1) Angularity - classified using Powers scale (Powers, 1953). 

2) Fresh surfaces – microtexture characterized by the presence of mechanical marks (i.e. fractures, 

abrasion marks, sharp edges) that are responsible for the recent exposure of part, or the totality, of 

the grain surface. These are also habitually characterised by the absence of chemical dissolution or 

precipitation in those new surfaces. 

3) Percussion marks - microtextures characterised by the presence of, usually, V-shaped 

depressions, typically the result of grain collision. 

4) Adhering particles – characterized by the presence of microparticles on the surface of quartz 

grains. Usually, these microparticles are within grooves and many are attached to the surfaces of 

individual grains. 

5) Dissolution - microtexture of chemical nature indicating the degree of dissolution on the surface of 

individual grains. The effects of dissolution are noticed by the destruction of fresh surfaces and 

sharp edges on the surface of the grains and by the formation of grooves. 

 

A semi-quantitative approach to the microtextural classification of each grain was used, based upon 

the proportion of grain surface occupied by each feature [0 (absent) to 5 (&gt; 75% of the grain surface)]. The 

angularity of the grains was classified from 0 to 5 (very rounded to very angular). Median values for each 

variable were calculated for each sample and used in the subsequent statistical analysis. Results were

interpreted based on the knowledge of present day coastal environments and supported by standard 

statistical methods (using Statistica 10 software) including principal components and classificatory analyses. 

Kruskal-Wallis tests (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) were conducted and p-values were calculated to test the 

statistical significance of the results (p&lt;0.05; indicating that at least the mean value of one population is 

different from the others). 

 

 

Figure 4.1 Microtextural features. A0 to A5 – angularity (very rounded to very angular). B1 – percussion marks. B2 – 
detailed view of percussion mark. C1 – fresh surface (in this case, sharp edge, fractures and steps). C2 – detailed view of 
fresh surface. D – dissolution (especially visible on the right face of the grain). E – adhering particles (more visible in the 

center of the grain). 

 

In the literature, the number of grains reported as necessary for sedimentological interpretation 

varies within a wide range (cf. Mahaney, 2002; Costa et al., 2012b for a summary and examples). In this 

study, an empirical assessment was conducted to evaluate the minimum size of the sample with statistical 

meaning, focusing on the number of grains required to hold the median value characterizing each 

microtextural attribute reasonably constant within the sample. Our results suggest that the median value is 

about 20 grains. 

 

4.3.3. Atlas of microtextural features in quartz grains 

With the collected samples, and after laboratory treatment, a large number of SEM photos of the 

quartz grains were gathered. A group of twenty microtextures visible in the surface of quartz grains was

85 
 

identified and described and an atlas was compiled using selected photos to facilitate the identification of 

those microtextures. The microtextural atlas of quartz grains is presented in Annex 2. 

 

4.4. Mineralogy 

4.4.1. Heavy minerals 

Heavy mineral assemblages often reflect the provenance of Quaternary deposits. Heavy minerals 

are those with a specific gravity greater than 2.85 and are usually separated from the lighter mineral fraction 

in a sample by settling in a heavy liquid such as bromoform (Specific Gravity of 2.89) (Whalley, 1990). 

Samples (1 to 3? fraction) from a wide range of sedimentary environments (e.g. nearshore, dune and 

beach) and from tsunami and storm deposits were prepared in order to observe heavy minerals under the 

microscope in slides and to contribute to on-going provenance studies on heavy mineral characterization of 

tsunami and storm deposits. The slides were prepared as followed: samples were first washed using tap 

water. They were then wet sieved using a set of sieves at 0.5? interval. The sand fraction was assembled in 

the 1-3? fractions (125-500µm). Heavy minerals present were separated using bromoform and then 

mounted using Entelan resin on glass slides. The required amount of grains for each slide was obtained 

using a micro-splitter. About 300 transparent heavy minerals per slide samples were identified and counted 

under an Olympus BX40 petrographic microscope in each sample. 

 

4.4.2. Micromorphology analyses 

Sediment samples from Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta were collected for micromorphology 

analyses using the methodology described by Murphy (1986). The thin sections used in this study were 

prepared by Julie Boreham (Earthslides). It is standard to take samples by using rigid metal tins (box 

corers), and wrapping the sediment or soil with cling film, tissue and tape, in order to keep it intact and 

undisturbed in transit to the laboratory. The raw samples are then air dried, or in some instances lyophilized 

dried to remove all water before impregnation with a crystic polyester resin. It usually takes 6 weeks for the 

impregnated samples to cold cure to a 'rock hard' stage. After this, an additional 4 weeks of sectioning 

production time is usually required, making the total turn-around time about 10 weeks. The final glass thin-

sections are 25-30µm thick by 0.08m long, which enables the researcher to identify and understand the 

minerals, organic materials, and the sediment or soil structure and composition using the microscope 

(Olympus BX40). 

 

4.5. Age-estimation methods 

The techniques used in this work were selected because they were considered to be better suited 

for the time interval and sediments studied in this research. However, age-estimation of extreme marine 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

86 
 

inundations is, in most cases, problematic. Results tend to be difficult to interpret and in many situations the 

dates obtained are not accurate. The samples from Stoneybridge and Lhok Nga (Indonesia) are from 

contemporary events and have been collected immediately after the extreme marine inundations (i.e. the 

Great Storm of January 2005 and the 2004 Tsunami, respectively). 

 

4.5.1. OSL 

Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating (a development of Thermoluminescence) is used for 

dating terrigenous sediments, where exposure to light prior to burial has been extensive and non-existent 

after burial. The information given by OSL is therefore the time elapsed since the last episode of exposure to 

light or light-bleaching episode of the grains (Aitken, 1992). This technique measures the luminescence 

emitted from the most light-sensitive electron traps in minerals - essentially quartz and feldspars - (Wintle et 

al., 1994), though more recently illite and muscovite have been used with promising results, this energy 

being stored in the crystalline network and increasing with burial time. Luminescence age-estimation 

methods have previously been applied to tsunami deposits using thermoluminescence (e.g. Bryant et al., 

1996; Dawson et al., 1995), infra-red stimulated luminescence (e.g. Huntley and Clague, 1996; Ollerhead et 

al., 2001) and optically stimulated luminescence (e.g. Banerjee et al., 2001; Cunha et al., 2010). 

In brief, the laboratory treatment consists of a series of conventioned sample preparation 

techniques (e.g. sieving, acid leaching and oxidation with 10% HCl, 10% H2O2, 40% HF) after extrusion of 

the sediment under controlled laboratory lighting condition. The grains are mounted on stainless steel discs 

and then counted. Equivalent Dose (De) values are obtained through calibrating the “natural” optical signal, 

acquired during burial, against “regenerated” optical signals obtained by administering known amounts of 

laboratory dose. The luminescence age is obtained by dividing De value by the mean total dose rate value. 

The OSL results presented in this study have been obtained by collaborative work involving the Department 

of Earth Sciences, Marine and Environmental Research Centre, University of Coimbra (Portugal), Centro de 

Geofísica, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Évora, Portugal and the Nordic Laboratory for 

Luminescence Dating, Department of Earth Sciences, Aarhus University, Risø, Denmark. 

 

4.5.2. 
210

Pb and 
137

Cs 

210Pb is an unstable isotope present in the atmosphere and is produced by the decay of 222Rn, 

which is part of the U series - decay chain. This isotope is absorbed by the sediments where it decays to 

stable 206Pb over an interval of circa 150 years. By measuring the ratio between 210Pb and 206Pb in a column 

of sediment in relation to depth, and assuming that the atmospheric flux of 210Pb has remained constant, the 

time that has elapsed since the radioactive lead was deposited can be determined (Olsson, 1986). The 

sedimentation rate can then be established by using the vertical concentration profile of 210Pb excess to infer 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

87 
 

a uniform sedimentation rate using the constant rate supply method (Appleby and Oldfield, 1983). The 

laboratory procedure was followed according with description by Eakins and Morrison (1978). 

137Cs is an artificially generated radioactive nuclide (half-life of 30 years) that has only been 

produced in significant quantities as a result of thermonuclear weapons testing, which began in 1945. The 

temporal patterns of 137Cs input can be characterised by:  

1) detectable 137Cs in the northern hemisphere began in 1954, though some authors use a 

threshold of 1950; 

2) the second a remarkable peak in 137Cs corresponds to 1962-1964, congruent with a maximum 

in thermonuclear testing. 

Some areas had additional input in 1986 after the Chernobyl incident but to the present state of knowledge 

this is not the case of Portugal. This annual variation has been successfully used to determine sediment 

accumulation rates in a wide variety of depositional environments including reservoirs, lakes, wetlands, 

coastal areas, and flood plains. Identification of 137Cs loss and gain for each sampled location in the study 

site is made by comparison of the measurement done using gamma spectrometry from the reference sites 

with those from the study field, allowing the establishment of a sedimentation rate. Sediment samples used 

for 210Pb and 137Cs were measured at the University of Bordeaux (France) and ISMAR (Italy). 

 

4.5.3. Radiocarbon 

14C which is continually being produced in the upper atmosphere becomes stored in various global 

reservoirs (atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere) and is absorved by living organisms. All living 

organisms absorb carbon dioxide during tissue building in a ratio that is broadly in equilibrium with 

atmospheric carbon dioxide. After the death of the organisms the 14C decays to 14N. The activity of 14C in the 

atmosphere is known (15 disintegrations per minute per gram of total carbon, on average). The half-life of 

14C was originally calculated at 5568±30 years (Libby, 1955), but subsequently this has been more 

accurately determined as 5730±40 years (Godwin, 1962). However, the value that is used by convention is 

the former due to the large number of dates that had been produced prior to the new measurement. The 

logarithmic decay curve for radiocarbon is well established (e.g. Stuiver et al., 1998) and calculations can be 

made using this curve (up to app. 50000 years, which is approximately 8 times the half-life of 14C). 

There are four fundamental assumptions of radiocarbon age-estimation: the production of 14C is constant 

over time; the 14C:12C ratio in the biosphere and hydrosphere is in equilibrium with the atmospheric ratio; the 

decay rate of 14C can be established; a closed system has existed since the death of the organism. Over the 

years, these assumptions have been questioned but they can still be accepted in general terms. Two 

approaches are used to measure the residual 14C activity in a sample: the conventional radiocarbon dating 

or the Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

88 
 

The first involves the detection and counting of ? emissions from 14C atoms over a period of time in order to 

determine the rate of emissions and hence the activity of the sample. In the calculation of radiocarbon dates 

obtained by conventional methods, laboratories compare sample activities to a modern reference standard. 

The second uses particle accelerators as mass spectrometers to count the actual number of 14C atoms as 

opposed to their decay products (Aitken, 1990; Bowman, 1990). Comparing the two methodologies, one can 

conclude that AMS allows the measurements of much smaller samples and is quicker. 

The time in years since the death of an organism can be calculated from the following equation (e.g. Stuiver 

et al., 1998): 

  
 

 
     

  

 
    Equation 4.1 

 

Where ? is the decay constant of 14C, A0 is the 14C activity of the modern reference standard, and A is the 

measured 14C activity of the sample of unknown age. 

The sources of error in 14C dating are the temporal variations in 14C production, the isotopic fractionation, the 

circulation of marine carbon, the contamination of the samples (especially in shells - often used in 

palaeotsunami research) and the biogeochemistry of lake sediments. The radiocarbon dates used in this 

work were obtained at Beta Analytic Inc. (AMS) and their standard laboratory protocol was followed. 

Calibration was done using the CALIB 6.0 Radiocarbon program coupled with the IntCal09 curve (Stuiver 

and Reimer, 1993).

5  Results 

5.1. Salgados 

5.1.1. Lithostratigraphic features 

In total, 158 sediment cores (up to 5 m) were obtained from the Salgados lowland (Figure 5.1.1) 

using a hand-operated gouge, Edelman augers, van der Horst, van der Staay and Livingstone corers (as 

described in Chapter 4). Moreover, approximately 30 surface samples from present-day sedimentary 

environments, including the nearshore between 6 and 19m below msl, beach face, beach berm, dune and 

dune crest were collected by hand or directly collected from the sea bottom by scuba diving (Figure 5.1.1).

The lithostratigraphy of the lagoonal area is summarized in a schematic synthetic log based on cores 

collected in Lagoa dos Salgados showing six lithostratigraphic units deposited on top of the Plio-Pleistocene 

(Areias de Faro-Quarteira) basal sand (Figure 5.1.2). Eleven sediment samples were collected from organic-

rich layers or laminae in different cores where the major lithostratigraphical units were clearly identified and 

allowing for lateral correlations (see below; Table 5.1). 

Unit A – The lowermost unit, with a maximum thickness of 2.48m (core SG1), rests unconformably 

on the reddish fluviatile Plio-Pleistocene materials and is characterized in the seaward region of the basin by 

alternations of yellowish to grey sand with marine shell fragments and less abundant and thinner clay 

laminae. One radiocarbon date (see below) obtained from an organic mud lamina of the upper section of this 

unit, at 4.32m below surface (i.e. ca. 3m below msl) in SG1, yielded a radiocarbon age of ca. 4790 ± 50 

years Cal BC (Figure 5.1.2 and Table 5.1). This indicates that most of the coarser sediment of the basal unit 

accumulated in an essentially high-energy and shallow environment open to marine influence (e.g. ?13C 

value), preceding the pronounced drop in sea-level rise rate at 6000 to 7000 cal BP that characterizes the 

Holocene transgression in the Algarve and elsewhere along the western Portuguese coast (Freitas et al., 

2003; Teixeira et al., 2005; Vis, 2009). Two samples (obtained from cores SG1 and SG46) were used for 

sedimentological characterization of this unit. The values obtained for each core were conditioned by their 

position in terms of proximity to the coast confirming field observations: core SG1 presented 77.2% of 

coarse material (&gt;63 µm), 8.9% for CaCO3 content and 1.6% of organic matter (OM). On the other hand 

core SG46 (farther inland) presented 18.5% of coarse material, 1.1% for CaCO3 content and 3.8% in terms 

of OM. 

Unit B – This unit, with a maximum thickness of 1.32m (core SG44), is mainly composed of grey to 

brown mud with occasional intercalated layers of coarser sediment which wedge out laterally, indicating a 

significant decrease in the energy level of the environment with increased input of fine-grained terrigenous 

materials. The radiocarbon dates (obtained in different cores at ca. 2.4m to 3.1m below surface, i.e. ca. 1.0m 

to 1.6m below msl) constrain the deposition of this unit within the 3700 to 980 years Cal BC time span 

(Figure 5.1.2 and Table 5.1), a period of quasi-stability of mean sea level that should have favoured the 

build-up of the barrier and beach-dune system at the exposed facade of the Armação de Pêra embayment 

and increased the frequency of sediment choking of the inlet, thus favouring the retention of terrigenous 

sediment (e.g. ?13C value) within the lowland. Twelve samples from 8 different cores allowed 

characterization of this unit in terms of average and standard deviation percentages of coarse material, 

CaCO3 and OM, the values were 22.9±14%, 10.7±9.3% and 5.4±1.6% respectively, indicating marine 

signature but reduction of the energy level across the whole basin. 

Unit C – This unit rests conformably with the under and overlying units (Figure 5.1.2). It essentially 

consists of yellowish to greyish medium to fine sand containing marine shell (essentially bivalves) fragments, 

and exhibits normal (fining upward) grading. Sand is intercalated with numerous muddy laminae. It presents 

a maximum thickness of ca. 3.25m (core SG2). An age range (approximately 3000 to 1500 Cal BP) for this 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

91 
 

unit was estimated in context with the radiocarbon ages obtained for units B and D. Thirty three samples 

from thirteen different cores allowed characterization of this unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, 

CaCO3 and OM; the average and standard deviation values were: for the mud dominated intercalations - 

25.3±15.1%, 11.6±9.4% and 5.87±3.0% respectively; and for the sand dominated material: 90.1±9.9% and 

20.8±9.9%, respectively, the OM being virtually nil. 

Unit D – This unit is composed of brownish silt and clay material that becomes darker to the top. It 

presents a maximum thickness of approximately 0.75m (core SG46) and exhibits an abrupt contact with the 

overlying unit E. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained from organic sediment (at ca. 0.45 to 0.75m below 

surface, i.e. ca. 0.65 to 0.85m above msl) of this unit (Table 5.1) constraining its age of deposition between 

years Cal AD 420 and 1030. Thirty five samples from thirty two different cores allowed characterization of 

this unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and OM content; the average and standard 

deviation values were 12.2±16.7%, 9.2±7.0% and 4.1±1.3% respectively. 

Unit E – this unit is essentially composed of medium to fine sand, which contrasts markedly with the 

underlying sediment of unit D and is separated from it by an unconformity (Figure 5.1.3). Unit E is widely 

distributed in the lowland and present in several cores although its thickness decreases (from 0. 79 m – core 

SG LV 10 - to a few mm further inland – e.g. core SG 26) up to its landward limit ca. 800m from the present 

day coastline. The altitude of the basal contact of unit E rises gradually inland from ca. -0.05 m up to 1.28m 

above msl. This unit is laterally variable in terms of its thickness and sedimentary characteristics. It is 

observed in its seaward section as a massive sandy deposit with no identifiable laminations and without 

sedimentary structures. Several centimetre-sized mud rip-up clasts from the underlying unit were identified 

throughout this unit although more noticeable at its base. However, further inland this unit is characterized 

by finer sediments; this spatial contrast is expressed by higher ?10, ? 50 and ? 90 (implying shift towards 

finer size interval of the whole &gt;63µm grain size spectrum) with increasing distance to the inlet, and 

simultaneous enrichment in mud-sized particles. Forty five samples from forty two different cores allowed 

characterization of this unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and MO. The average and 

standard deviation values for the massive sand were 87.6±4.9%, 28.7±9.0% respectively, with no OM. 

Further inland the corresponding values were 54.24±15.5%, 23.0±7.7% and 2.32±0.54%. 

Unit F – The topmost unit is characterized as a dark brown silty/clayish layer presenting a maximum 

thickness of 2.20m (core SG47) and corresponds to the present-day sedimentary environment. In the field, 

units F and D are indistinguishable in places were unit E is absent. The upper (0.20m to 0.10m) centimetres 

of this unit are, in places, black. Field observations revealed some coarser intercalations (e.g. SG14_0.20-

0.28 – storm deposit? – also present in other cores in the coastal edge of the lagoon) within the mud 

restricted to an area closer to the inlet and extending northwest along the back barrier. 210Pb and 137Cs 

sedimentation rates were established for the top 0.30m of the stratigraphic column (Figure 5.1.2) and the 

results suggest that the low-energy deposits resting on top of the coarser unit E in core SG48 are younger 

than AD 1865. Forty four samples from thirty five different cores allowed characterization of unit F in terms of 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

92 
 

the percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and OM. The bulk of unit F yielded average and standard 

deviation values of 18.8±14.2%, 9.2±4.2% and 4.5±1.32%, respectively. In contrast, the coarser 

intercalations presented values of 66.6±9.6%, 20.3±8.2% respectively, the OM being virtually absent. 

Results indicate a time-integrated accumulation rate derived from the vertical profile of 210Pb excess of ca. 

2.6mm/yr. Moreover, taking AD 1963 as the maximum nuclear testing in the northern hemisphere (Ritchie 

and McHenry, 1990) the accumulation rate obtained from the 137Cs peak at 0.10m below surface is 

2.3mm/yr, which is in rough agreement with the value inferred from 210Pb (Figure 5.1.2).

Pleistocene dissected basement (see text for details); the relative location of cores from which 11 radiocarbon dates and

Figure 5.1.3 – Photos of contact of Unit E with under and overlying units identified in Lagoa dos Salgados. 

 

A repeating lithostratigraphic sequence occurs in the flat-floored depression of Lagoa dos Salgados 

(Figure 5.1.4). Within this stratigraphical sequence a peculiar feature was observed in the geometrical 

distribution of unit E. This unit is thicker in the coastal edge of the lowland space and it decreases to 

millimetric thickness in the northern part of the Lagoa dos Salgados, just before wedging out. In Figure 5.1.4 

in profile A-A’, it is observed that unit E decreases its thickness with increasing distance inland, presenting 

ca. 0.50m in the core section nearest to the coast and decreasing to millimetric thickness at about 400m 

inland. In addition, the elevation of the basal contact increases inland. On the other hand, profiles B-B’ and 

C-C’ exhibit unit E consisting of a very thin (centimetric) sand lamina quickly disappearing inland. Thus, one 

can conclude that unit E is a distinct wedge-shaped and ramping up lens of coarse sediment extending 

across the lowland for several hundred meters inland, being thickest at the coast, closest to the present-day 

inlet.

5.1.2. Textural features 

The analysis of the geographical variation of a group of geometrical, compositional and textural 

features (e.g. thickness, percentage of sand, percentage of Ca carbonates, ?10, ?50, ? 90, mean, mode, 

standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness) of sediment from unit E was also conducted (Table 5.2). The 

percentage of sand (Figure 5.1.5A), decreases inland with maximum values (up to 100%) in the south-

eastern areas of the basin and presents lowest values (up to 20%) in the northern and north-western sectors 

of the lowland. The lower values found closer to the landward edge of the deposit mirror the decreasing 

transport competence and capacity of a landward transport mechanism. However, it may, in cases, be also 

influenced by the very small thicknesses of the unit E in the more distal locations, where field subsampling 

could not avoid contamination of the sand by the over and underlying mud. The space distribution of mean 

grain size (Figure 5.1.5A) exhibits a pattern congruent with that of the proportion of sand. The largest values 

(460µm) occur in the south-eastern area and the lowest values in the north and northwest sectors. Similar 

patterns were also observed for median, mode, ?90 and ?10 parameters (Table 5.2). 

The analysis of textural parameters indicates that unit E is coarser and thicker across the southern 

part of Salgados basin whereas the majority of the finer-grained sediment occurs in the northern to north-

western part (Figure 5.1.5 and 5.1.6). These features point to a seaward source of unit E and dispersion 

path from seaward (coarser and thicker) to landward (finer and thinner). According to Friedman (1961) 

positive skewness in medium to fine sand could be the result of unidirectional flow or the result of rapid 

deposition preventing the washing out of finer particles. In our study (Figure 5.1.6B) a skewness pattern 

compatible with the above mentioned interpretation can be observed. The combination of textural results 

and geometrical data also suggest a north-south trending area (possibly a palaeo-channel) in the middle of 

the basin as a preferred route through which sediment was transported inland. It is also worth noting that 

regardless the distance to this channel, the plot of textural attributes in Figures 5.1.5 and 5.1.6 trend 

obliquely to the elongation of the barrier. In cores where unit E has more than 0.03m thick its mean grain 

size is ca. 1.5 ? (i.e. 370µm), it varies considerably with location within the lowland. When comparison is 

established between these sediments and their possible sources, represented by the studied present-day 

analogues, the widest variation in mean grain size is detected in sand from unit E, ranging from 1.05 ? to 3.5 

? (Table 5.2). The distal nearshore samples (collected between 11m and 19m below msl) and materials 

from unit D are slightly finer grained, presenting an average mean diameter of ca. 2.50 ? and 2.20 ?, 

respectively. By contrast, the beach and dune sedimentary environments exhibit lower values (i.e. coarser 

sediments) of 0.75 ? and 1 ?, respectively. 

In the few cores that allowed the study of the vertical variation of textural attributes within unit E, the mean 

grain size (also the percentage of sand and percentage of Ca carbonate) remain virtually invariant or slightly 

decreasing up unit (Table 5.2).

5.1.3. Morphoscopic features 

Morphoscopic analyses were conducted in a group of samples (unit E, dune, beach and 

nearshore). Sediment obtained from core SG14_(0.20-0.28) and possibly corresponding to a  storm deposit  

was also studied. The samples were divided into three groups, each group corresponding to contrasting 

depositional environments: Unit E and sample SG14_(0.20-0.28), representing high-energy single events; 

dune and beach; nearshore. Samples from Unit E were observed: as a profile (with increasing distance from 

the coast) SG14_(0.40-0.82)-SG20-SG22-SG26; with samples within unit from 2 cores: LV7 and LV10; and 

a possible storm deposit sample SG14_(0.20-0.28). Dune samples also present a profile roughly 

corresponding to an outline from the coast-inland (with one dune crest sample – SG_Duna2_Crista). 

Nearshore samples were collected at different depths below msl offshore the Armação de Pêra bay. The 

basic morphoscopic data for each group is presented in the same order: composition (Figures 5.1.7, 5.1.10 

and 5.1.13); roundness (Figures 5.1.8, 5.1.11 and 5.1.14); sphericity (Figures 5.1.9, 5.1.12 and 5.1.15). 

These results are complement by other morphoscopic data presented as histograms in: Figure 5.1.16 [Unit 

E and SG14_(0.20-0.28)], Figure 5.1.17 and Figure 5.1.18 (beach and dune) and Figure 5.1.19 (nearshore). 

In Figure 5.1.7 it is possible to observe the compositional characteristics of Unit E deposits and sample 

SG14_(0.20-0.28). The percentage of quartz grains, lithic material and bioclasts is shown. In terms of the 

percentage of quartz grains, Unit E samples are typically in the 60-75% range. This is in contrast with 

sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) that presents a value above 80% of quartz grains. Moreover, in terms of the 

percentage of lithic material it can be observed that all samples present values in the order of 10-15% with 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

101 
 

the exception of LV10_(0.80-0.81), LV10_(0.90-0.91) and SG26 that present values of 6%, 18% and 18% 

respectively. In what concerns the percentage of bioclasts, it was observed that all samples from Unit E 

present values between 15% and 30%, while sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) presents a considerably lower 

value(5%). 

In terms of roundness for the same group of samples (Figure 5.1.8) it is possible to perceive that 

the highest values for well-rounded and rounded grains (app. 50%) were detected in samples LV10_(0.46-

0.47) and LV10_(0.90-0.91) respectively top and base of Unit E. Moreover, in core LV7 the base of unit E 

presents higher percentage of well-rounded and rounded grains when compared with the top of the unit. In 

all other samples values for well-rounded and rounded grains are in the 25%-40% range. In what concerns 

very angular and angular grains it was possible to visualize that most samples present values in the order of 

40%-50%, the exception being cores LV7 and LV10. Furthermore, in core LV10 it was possible to establish 

a roughly decreasing upward trend on the presence of very angular and angular grains within Unit E (values 

ranging between 15 and 30%) whereas on core LV7 the base of the deposits presented values of 35% for 

very angular and angular grains and the top of the deposit presented higher values (44%).  

Figure 5.1.9 presents the shape characteristics for the same group of samples. Spherical grains were 

observed in 20%-35% of the samples and the lowest sphericity values were detected in samples SG20 and 

LV7_(0.40-0.41). In what concerns prismatic and sub-prismatic shapes it was perceived that all samples 

typically presented values in the range 30%-40% with the exception of sample LV10_(0.46-0.47) that 

presented a value of 21% . The lowest value of spherical grains was observed in sample 14_(0.20-0.28) with  

15%. In terms of discoidal and sub-discoidal grains no trend was possible to observe because all values 

were detected within the 35%-50% without any discernible peculiarity 

Figure 5.1.10 presents the dune and beach samples compositional characteristics. All samples 

present quartz grains in the range of 50% to 60%. Regarding the percentage of lithic material it was 

observed that sample Dune_2RR (farther inland) presented the highest value, with 26% of lithic sediment 

while all the other samples presented lithics between 14% (i.e. Face_Praia – beach face) and 20% (e.g.  

Duna - dune). Bioclasts are present in all samples (25%-30%) with the exception of sample Duna_2RR with 

16% of bioclasts. A slightly inland decreasing trend of the percentage of bioclasts was detected. 

In terms of roundness, in the dune and beach samples from Lagoa dos Salgados (Figure 5.1.11), 

the well-rounded and rounded grains were present in the range 25%-50% in the dune samples (with a slight 

increasing inland trend) while the beach samples present values between 17% (i.e. Praia_TdV) and 45% 

(e.g. Berma). In what concerns very angular and angular grains, dune samples presented values ranging 

from 15% (i.e. Duna_2RR) to 34 % (i.e. Duna) whereas beach samples presented higher values ranging 

from 30% to 60%.

 Figure 5.1.12 presents the data obtained by analysing the shape of dune and beach samples from 

Lagoa dos Salgados. Spherical grains were observed in higher percentage in dune samples (20%-30%) 

than in beach samples (&lt;20%) although sample Berma presented 29% of spherical grains. This result, 

coupled with higher proportion of spherical grains in the dune samples farther inland might suggest an 

increasing inland trend. In terms of discoidal and sub-discoidal grains it was observed that beach samples 

typically presented values of ca. 55% (except Berma with 40%) for these types of grain shape. By contrast, 

dune samples presented values that ranged from 28% (Duna_2F) to 54% (Duna_F). No clear spatial trend 

was identified. Regarding prismatic and sub-prismatic grains all samples presented values between 20% 

and 30% with no perceptible pattern. 

 Figure 5.1.13 presents the compositional features of the nearshore samples collected within the 

Salgados/Armação de Pêra bay. In compositional terms the nearshore samples are in contrast with other 

samples observed in Lagoa dos Salgados. In fact, they present very high percentages of bioclasts ranging 

from 50% to 70%, with the exception of ArmP_19m (sample farther offshore) with 34% of bioclasts. In what 

concerns lithic material all samples presented similar values within the 15%-30% interval. In none of the two 

above mentioned features a spatial trend was identified. Regarding the quartz percentage it was observed 

that the samples with higher percentage of quartz grains were ArmP_11m and ArmP_19m (which are the 

samples closest and farthest located from the coastline) with 36% and 47% respectively. All the other 

samples presented values between 10% and 25%. 

The study of roundness of the nearshore samples (Figure 5.1.14) yieldied values for very angular 

and angular grains within the 20%-30% range with no observed spatial trend. The only two exceptions were 

samples ArmP_19 and ArmP_17.1 that present values of 16% and nil. Well-rounded and rounded grains 

presented percentage between 40% and 60% with no clear trend detectable. 

The spherical character of the nearshore samples was measured (Figure 5.1.15) and it was 

possible to observe that all samples presented ca. 50% of spherical grains with the exception of sample 

ArmP_13m that presented a value of 35% of spherical quartz grains. Discoidal and sub-discoidal grains 

presented its higher percentage in sample ArmP_13m with 43% and its lower percentage in sample 

ArmP_17.1m with 21%. All other samples presented values between 30% and 40%. Prismatic and sub-

prismatic grains presented results of ca. 20% with exceptions of samples ArmP_16m, ArmP_18m and 

ArmP_19m with values of 10%, 13% and 15% respectively. In terms of sphericity no spatial trend was 

established.

 Comparison of morphoscopic characteristics of grains from different sedimentary environments and 

lithostratigraphic units suggests that nearshore samples typically present more than 45% of well-rounded 

and rounded grains whereas, dunes present values of ca. 40%, beach samples exhibit values below 30%, 

unit E samples the widest range of values, varying from 20% to 50%, and finally sample 14_(0.20-0.28) 

presented a value of 25%. In what concerns very angular and angular grains, dune samples show values 

under 30% and beach samples above 50%; unit E presented about 40% (exception core LV10), nearshore 

samples also presented values of ca. 40% and sample 14_(0.20-0.28) a value of 45%. Regarding spherical 

grains it was observed that the highest percentage of these grains occurs in the nearshore samples (app. 

50%). In contrast, the lowest values were observed in sample 14_(0.20-0.28) with 15% and in beach 

samples  (ca. 20%). Unit E exhibited values of 20%-30%, whereas dunes presented higher values, varying 

between 30 and 40%.

5.1.4. Microtextural features 

Microtextural features were analysed and quantified in samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. Figure 

5.1.16 exhibits SEM images of quartz grains from Lagoa dos Salgados different sedimentary environments 

and from Unit E. In Annex 2 an atlas of quartz grain microtextural features is presented.

Distal nearshore; E- unit E, F- detail of percussion marks (approximately 12 microns in length) imprinted on the surface of a 

grain from unit E. 

 

 Figures 5.1.17 [samples from unit E and sample SG14_(0.20-0.28)], 5.1.18 (samples from dune 

and beach) and 5.1.19 (samples nearshore) and Table 5.1.3 (all samples) present the results obtained after 

microtextural classification of quartz grains collected in Lagoa dos Salgados. Furthermore, to verify grain-

size influence (all samples were analysed in the 1-3 ? fraction) two samples, one finer (i.e. SG20m) and 

another coarser (i.e. SG20M) than the fraction analysed (SG20) were also classified to establish if size 

conditioned the features observed and their frequency. In fact, if we compare the three samples from core 

SG20 we conclude that angularity and fresh surfaces are substantially higher in the finer fraction, while 

percussion marks and dissolution are higher in the coarser fraction. The sample that presented more 

balanced classificatory results was SG20 (i.e. 1-3 ? fraction) thus supporting the choice of grain size to 

analyse. 

 Sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) can be compared to all samples from unit E presenting higher angularity, 

fresh surfaces (with the exception of SG26), the lowest expression of dissolution features in this group of 

samples and relevant presence of percussion marks [only comparable with SG14_(0.40-0.82)]. The two 

samples from LV7 did not indicate any pattern or trend when comparing base and top of unit E. In fact, both 

samples presented very similar values in all microtextural features with the only exception of adhering 

particles (higher values for the sample collected at the base of unit E). On the other hand, samples from core 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

109 
 

LV10 revealed some peculiarities. In this case, it was possible to observe a decreasing trend in terms of 

angularity and fresh surfaces towards the top, although the highest values were observed in sample 

LV10_(0.80-0.81) with 2.921 and 3.134, respectively. However it is important to stress that the variation 

between all samples from this core was minor, between 1.892 and 2.921. In what concerns dissolution and 

adhering particles a mirror image of the described above can be observed, with the lowest value (i.e. 1.600 

and 1.815, respectively) observed in sample LV10_(0.80-0.81). A foggy decreasing upward trend can be 

detected [with exception of sample LV10_(0.80-0.81)] in dissolution and adhering particles, as well as in  

percussion marks. 

No spatial trend is readily detectable, although percussion marks tend to decrease inland, whereas fresh 

surfaces seem very slightly increase with distance from the coast (except sample SG20). 

 

 

Figure 5.1.17 – Microtextural results and their spatial distribution in fraction 1-3 ? of samples from unit E and 14_(0.20-0.28) 

from Lagoa dos Salgados. 

 

 Beach and dune samples revealed differences in microtextural attribute (Figure 5.1.18). Dunes 

presented values of angularity between 2 and 3, with higher values for dune crests (i.e. Crista_Duna and 

Duna2_Crista) and for the more recent dune ridge (DunaF). In the dune samples, fresh surfaces exhibit 

values varying from 1.25 to 2, with the exception of the higher value (i.e. 2.5) of one dune crest (i.e. 

Duna2_Crista) and the lower value (i.e. 0.75) for sample Duna_2RR (farther inland). Dissolution values for 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

110 
 

the dune samples from Lagoa dos Salgados varied within the range 1.75 (i.e. Duna_R) and 3.3 (i.e. Duna). 

As regards to adhering particles the dune samples showed a narrower range (between 3 and 3.5) with two 

exceptions presenting values of 2.66 and 2.63 (Duna_R and Duna_F, respectively). In what concerns, 

percussion marks classification in dune samples, it was possible to determine that the values attributed to 

the samples varied between 1.0 (Duna2_Crista) and 2.36 (Duna_2F). In none of the microtextural features 

analysed a clear pattern or trend emerged in terms of distribution of values. 

On the other hand, beach samples exhibited angularity values &gt;2.75 with the exception of sample 

Praia_TdV (i.e. 1.80). It is also interesting to note that the sample corresponding to the beach berm (i.e. 

Berma) presented a lower value (when compared with Face_Praia and Barra). In terms of fresh surfaces 

observed in grains from the beach, the berm (i.e. Berma) presented the lower value (i.e. 2.0) whereas the 

other samples presented values above 2.6. In what regards dissolution features observed  in the beach 

samples  they occur in  extremely low values, with the lowest value (0.33) observed in the beach face 

sample (i.e. Face_Praia) and the highest value (1.58) detected in the beach berm (i.e. Berma) sample. 

Adhering particles revealed the most striking difference between beach samples, with the berm (i.e. Berma) 

presenting a value of 2.41 whereas all the other samples exhibited values&amp;lt;0.66. Percussion marks were 

present especially in the beach face sample (i.e. Face_Praia) with a value of 2.75, while the other samples 

presented values within the interval 1.07-1.80.

Nearshore samples can be divided in two groups: one composed of samples collected to the west 

of Lagoa dos Salgados inlet (identified with the ArmP acronym) and another group composed by samples 

collected immediately to the south of Lagoa dos Salgados (identified with the SG acronym). It was possible 

to observe that, in both groups, trends and spatial patterns are present (Figure 5.1.19). For instance, 

angularity and fresh surfaces decrease with increasing distance from coastline and depth. For example, 

ArmP samples range from 1.21 (i.e. ArmP_19m) to 3.0 (i.e. ArmP_11m) for angularity and from 0.21 to 1.81 

for fresh surfaces in the exact same samples. On the other hand, adhering particles increase with distance 

to coastline, varying from 2.45 (i.e. SG-6m sample) to 3.80 (i.e. SG-18m sample). Regarding dissolution 

marks, a trend could only be recognized in one group of samples that presented decreasing values toward 

the coastal fringe, values varying from 1.70 (i.e. SG-6m sample) to 3.93 (i.e. SG-18m sample). Percussion 

marks did not present a clear spatial distribution, exhibiting values of 0.01 for sample SG-18m and values of 

2.0 for sample SG-9m and SG-18m.

 A summary characterization of microtextural features for every sedimentary environment studied, 

for unit E (tsunami samples) and for sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) (possible storm?) reveals that: 

- Beach grains presented the highest values for fresh surfaces and strong presence of 

percussion marks. Dissolution and adhering particles are almost absent. 

- Dune grains revealed a well balance representation of all the microtextural features. 

- Nearshore samples presented high values of dissolution and adhering particles and moderate 

presence of percussion marks and fresh surfaces. 

- Storm grains present many similarities with beach samples and unit E samples and can only 

be differentiated by the lower value of adhering particles. 

- Tsunami-deposited grains (Unit E) presented the highest values of percussion marks and fresh 

surfaces (thus suggesting strong hydrodynamic processes before deposition). Tsunami grains 

can also be characterized by presenting the widest range of values observed in all the 

microtextural features.

5.1.5. Heavy mineral features 

The heavy minerals assemblage was analysed in samples from the same environments as 

described above (Table 5.1.4). Samples from unit E and SG14_(0.20-0.28) revealed a percentage of heavy 

minerals in total sediment ranging from 0.25% to 0.45% with the exception of sample SG26 and LV7_(0.40-

0.41) with extremely low values of 0.015% and 0.043% respectively. By contrast beach samples present a 

percentage of heavy minerals below 0.2% while dune samples present values around 0.25% with the 

exception of samples Duna2_Crista (0.075%), A_Duna (0.106%), Duna_2F (0.101%) and Duna_R (0.426). 

Furthermore, the nearshore samples present extremely low values of&amp;lt;0.092% of heavy minerals in total 

sediment. 

Figure 5.1.20 and Table 5.1.5 exhibit the heavy mineral composition of samples from unit E and 

sample SG14_(0.20-0.28). These samples (as all collected in Lagoa dos Salgados) present mainly three 

different minerals (i.e. andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) that typically correspond to ca. 85-90% of the 

heavy mineral population of the samples. Furthermore, other minerals were also identified from which 

amphiboles stand out with percentage that reached almost 6%. 

Unit E heavy mineral assemblage did not revealed a clear horizontal or upward trend although in 

cores LV7 and LV10 the base of the deposit presents the lowest value (in each core) for andalusite and the 

highest for tourmaline. Values for these minerals varied between 23.1%-47.1% (andalusite) and 35.6%-

58.95% (tourmaline). In what concerns amphiboles and other minerals (e.g. zircon; garnet, sphene, 

silimanite, epidote, pyroxene, rutile and brookite) percentages values, these were very low. In the case of 

amphiboles results were&lt;1.1% [except sample LV10_(0.80-0.81) with 1.31%] and in the case of other 

minerals the sample presented the highest result with 4.6% while the other samples exhibited values&amp;lt;3.0%. 

Sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) was differentiated from samples from unit E by the higher percentage of 

staurolite (i.e. 24%) while in unit E samples varied from 13.2%-19.1%.

Figure 5.1.20 - – Heavy minerals results and their spatial distribution in samples from unit E and 14_(0.20-0.28) from Lagoa 
dos Salgados. 

 

In what concerns beach samples (Figure 5.1.21 and Table 5.1.5), they presented percentages of 

andalusite varying from 27.4% (Barra) to 38.4% (i.e. Praia_TdV). Moreover, these samples exhibited values 

of staurolite of ca. 3.0% with the exception of the beach berm sample (i.e. Berma) that showed a value of 

9.18%. The highest percentage value for tourmaline was observed in sample Face_Praia with a value of 

67.2% while the lowest value was observed in sample Berma with 50%. Amphiboles were vestigial (i.e. 

0.001%) with the exception of sample Berma with 2.0%. In the beach samples collected in Lagoa dos 

Salgados it was also possible to observe other minerals that summed percentages variying from 1.7% (i.e. 

Face_Praia) to 8.5% (i.e. Praia_TdV). 

Regarding dune samples (Figure 5.1.21 and Table 5.1.5), no spatial trend could be established 

based in the heavy mineral composition. These samples presented values within the range 25.7%-41.8% of 

andalusite, of 6.79%-13.8% of staurolite and 46.7%-60.0% of tourmaline. The highest percentage (i.e. 

2.85%) of amphiboles was observed in sample Duna_2F while the lowest value (i.e. 0.001%) was detected 

in samples Crista_Duna and Duna2_RR. The content in other minerals presented its lowest value (i.e. 

0.011%) in the dune crest samples (i.e. Crista_Duna and Duna2_Crista) and the highest value of 6.18% in 

sample A_Duna.

Nearshore samples also did not allow the establishment of any distinguishable spatial pattern 

(Figure 5.1.22 and Table 5.1.5). In nearshore samples andalusite varied between 38.68% (i.e. SG-9m) and 

27.58% (i.e. SG-18m), while ataurolite ranged from 1.46% to 7.69% (i.e. SG-9m and SG-15m, respectively). 

On the other hand, the highest value for tourmaline was observed in sample SG-15m with a value of 58.9% 

while the lowest value was detected in SG-18m with 49.4%. Nearshore samples present higher values for 

amphiboles (up to 5.7%) and for other minerals (up to 10.35%). 

Comparison of heavy mineral assemblages from different sedimentary environments and 

lithostratigraphic units suggests that unit E samples present similar percentage values of heavy mineral 

assemblage as dune samples (i.e. andalusite, tourmaline, amphiboles and other minerals). Furthermore, the 

only exception is staurolite that presents its higher values (between 13.2% and 19.1% in samples from unit E 

and its highest value (i.e. 24.0%) in sample SG14_(0.20-0.28). Staurolite in dune samples varies from 6.79% 

to 13.8%. Beach samples were distinguishable by the higher percentage of other minerals and by the lowest 

percentage of staurolite. On the other hand, nearshore samples were differentiated by the higher content in 

amphiboles and other minerals.

5.2. Boca do Rio 

5.2.1. Lithostratigraphic features 

Boca do Rio sediment infilling has been studied by several authors (e.g. Dawson et al., 1995; 

Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Oliveira et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010), which described 

a sandy deposit associated with the AD 1755 tsunami inundation sandwiched within estuarine mud. The top 

meter of the lithostratigraphy of the present-day alluvial plain has been described by other (see references 

above) and can be summarized by Figure 5.2.1. The uppermost layer of the sedimentary sequence consists 

of dark red/brown silty clay with an almost constant thickness of 0.80 - 1m. The underlying layer has been 

associated with the AD 1755 tsunami and has only been found within the main valley and the north-eastern 

(Ribeira de Vale Barão) tributary (Figure 5.2.2). It is present in the stratigraphic column up to ca.1500m from 

the coastline. The thickness of this sandy unit decreases from ca. 0.50m in the coastal edge of the alluvial 

plain to a few centimetres in the area where the tributary streams merge into the alluvial field. This unit 

presents a strong lateral variability and is sedimentologically complex. Five sedimentologically distinct sub-

units were recognised by Hindson and Andrade (1999) within this unit in the seaward area of the lowland. 

These sub-units presented a distinguishable character varying from silty fine sand to clean marine sand, a 

dark brown layer, or a chaotic layer that also included boulders (in the southern sector of the alluvial plain). 

However, the sub-units were not consistently present throughout the alluvial plain and lateral variations in 

their appearance where frequent at short distances. Further inland, Hindson and Andrade (1999) state that 

the deposit is simpler and is reduced to a thin shelly sand layer before tapering out. The lower contact is 

clearly erosive and the upper contact with overlying unit is gradational, and in places difficult to establish. 

The altitude of the basal contact of the tsunamigenic unit rises gradually inland from ca. 1.0 to 1.6m. The 

layer underlying it is very similar to the topmost unit, consisting of the same brown mud with occasional 

organic material and charcoal. In some locations, the brown mud grades downwards into a black organic 

mud. The thickness of this unit varies between 0.5 and 1m. The base of this stratigraphic sequence consists 

of grey, marine sands with shells extending beyond a depth of 5m below ground surface without reaching 

the base. 

Samples from tsunami sediment and present day analogues were collected in this area and used in 

this work (Figure 5.2.3). Three tsunami samples (SAO, SAM and SS3 – corresponding to a profile inland) 

were cored from the alluvial plain and crossing through the tsunamigenic unit, were studied. Furthermore, 

eleven other sediment samples (five nearshore, three dune, one beach and two alluvial) were also retrieved 

and utilized in this work to characterize present day sedimentary environments. The nearshore samples 

correspond to a profile from -20m below msl up to -5m below msl. The dune samples consist of aeolian 

material predating the AD 1755 event and preserved in karst hollows (P6 and P8) in the downwind slope of

the rock spur barring the lowland and one (pedogenised) sample of dune sand topping the spur crest, 

interpreted as the remnant of a climbing dune (Duna_Trep). 

The chronology for the lithostratigraphy of Boca do Rio has been intensely debated (see references 

above).

5.2.2. Textural features 

Grain-size parameters obtained for the group of samples used in this study are summarized in Table 

5.2.1. With these results it is possible to recognise a decreasing inland trend for the 1%? and the 10% ? in 

the tsunami samples. The standard deviation decrease inland while the remaining parameters did not 

revealed a clear trend. The beach sample (i.e. Face) presented a mean grain size of 1.66 ?. The P6 and P8 

dune samples presented many similarities in all textural aspects analysed while the dune sample Duna_Trep 

although sharing many resemblances, presented a slightly coarser overall grain-size. Within the nearshore 

samples one sample stands out (-10m) due to its remarkably coarser nature, its large standard variation (i.e. 

1.60) and abrupt increase in size characterizing the 1 and 10 centiles; this is interpreted as resulting from 

bias introduced by a small number of large particles in an otherwise Gaussian size-distribution. The standard 

deviation in other samples remains under 0.55 ? with the exception of the alluvial sediment. All the other 

nearshore samples presented mean values of approximately 1.75? (sample -10m presented a mean grain 

size value of 0.93?) and kurtosis between 1.11 and 1.21. The more heterometric sample is the alluvial 

sample (i.e. Alv_Dirt) presenting the lowest 90% and the highest 1% ? with obvious consequences in the 

standard deviation value, by far the highest value observed (i.e. 2.83). Textural data allowed the clear

124 
 

distinction of two samples (i.e. -10m and Alv_Dirt) among the ones analysed. The other entire group of 

samples share many of the aspects analysed and presented similar values that decreased the differentiation 

capacity solely based in the textural proxy.

 An extrapolation of the percentage of sand and of the median grain size of the tsunamigenic unit is 

presented in Figure 5.2.4 (for sample location see Figure 5.2.3). In this figure it is possible to visualize the 

decrease in the proportion of sand with increasing distance from the coastline. The mean grain size (i.e. 

D50) revealed a somewhat more complex pattern with lower values in the centre of the alluvial plain close to 

its left embankment superimposed upon a general trend of decrease in median grain size with increasing 

distance inland.

 In terms of micromorphological studies it was possible to analyse a sample from BDR_T2_97_105 

that included the contact between the tsunamigenic sandy unit and the underlying layer (Figure 5.2.5). In 

compositional terms no major contrast was registered from the base to the top of the sand in the thin 

section.  Quartz was present throughout the thin section in percentage around 75-90%, Calcite was also 

common (app. 10%), Mica was detected in low percentage but many shell fragments (up to 15 %) where 

identified in the thin section. Rounded mud clasts show out distinctively in the thin section and one of the 

major changes observed was the presence of rip-up clasts solely on the basal 4 cm of the unit.  Other major 

change observed was related with the size of mud clasts and grains (smaller to the top of the unit), together 

with the decrease of abundance in shell fragments towards the top; in addition, the compaction of the 

sediment is higher at the base of the deposit.

5.2.3. Morphoscopy features 

Morphoscopic analyses were conducted in samples from Boca do Rio (Figure 5.2.6). In 

compositional terms it was possible to verify that the nearshore samples (Figure 5.2.6A) presented a 

percentage of quartz grains in the range of 50% to 70% (i.e. samples -5m and -20m). In terms of the 

percentage of lithic material little variation was noted in the nearshore samples, which presented values of 

ca. 25%. Bioclasts presence varied between 9.52% (-10m) and 27.72% (i.e. -12.5m). 

The beach sample presented values of 44.79% for quartz grains, 31.25% for lithic material and 

23.96% for bioclasts. On the other hand, dune samples present the overall lowest value for lithic material 

(i.e. P6-15.50% and P8-18.81%) although these samples presented contrasting percentages for quartz 

(P6- 61.39%; P8- 42.20%) and bioclasts (P6- 19.80%; P8- 42.20%; respectively). The alluvial sample 

presented the following percentages: 63% for quartz grains; 25% for lithic material and 12% for bioclasts. 

The tsunami samples (i.e. SAM and SAO) presented similar values for quartz but contrasting values for 

lithic material (higher in sample SAM - farther inland) and for bioclasts (higher in sample SAO – closest to 

the coast line).

Regarding roundness of the quartz grains observed (Figure 5.2.7) it is visible that the nearshore 

samples present a higher percentage of angular and very angular grains in the samples closer to the coast 

(maximum value of 59.20% and 50.00% for samples -7.5m and -5m respectively). In contrast the well-

rounded and rounded grains were present in higher percentage in the samples farther away from the coast 

(i.e. 46.15% and 48.00% for samples -20m and -15m respectively). The high values observed for the 

proximal nearshore samples (i.e. -5m and -7.5m) were also observed in the beach sample (i.e. Face) with a 

percentage of 52.17% for very angular and angular grains. The dune samples presented a large 

predominance of well-rounded, rounded and sub-rounded grains with values of 68.00% for sample P6 and of 

65.00% for sample P8, respectively. On the other hand, tsunami samples show high values for very angular 

and angular grains (i.e. SAM-56.10 % and SAO-44.90%) with the higher values observed farther inland. 

 The shape of quartz grains was also analysed in Boca do Rio (Figure 5.2.8). The nearshore 

samples presented a decreasing trend towards the coast of spherical grains with values of 34.62 % for 

sample -20m and of 13.85% for sample -7.5m. Sample -5m presented a value of 25.86% in contrast with the 

tendency described above. The beach and dune samples showed values of ca. 25% of spherical grains. The 

alluvial samples exhibited a value of 30.77% for spherical grains and the highest value of all samples for 

prismatic grains (i.e. 23.08%). On the other hand, tsunami samples (i.e. SAM and SAO) revealed 

percentage of ca. 17% of spherical grains and ca. 55% for discoid and sub-discoid grains (sample SAM- 

farther inland- with the higher value – 58.14%). 

 The morphoscopic results allowed the differentiation of sedimentary environments mainly based in 

the roundness and sphericity characteristics of grains (i.e. well-rounded and rounded grains are more 

present in the distal nearshore samples while more angular grains are present in the proximal, beach and 

tsunami samples). In terms of spatial variation of morphoscopic characteristics in the tsunami samples, the 

low number of samples constrains interpretations but it is important to note an increase inland of lithic 

material.

5.2.4. Microtextural features 

The microtextural results obtained for Boca do Rio are summarized in Figure 5.2.9 and Table 5.2.2. 

In terms of angularity, all samples present values in the range between 2.2 and 2.5, except higher 

values yielded by beach and two proximal nearshore samples (3.000, 3.462 and 3.417, respectively) and 

lower values by two nearshore samples -15m and -20m ( 1.455 and 1.909, respectively) and one dune 

sample (Duna_Trep  - 1.667). On the other hand, fresh surfaces present highest values in nearshore 

samples -5m and -7.5m (4.385 and 4.250, respectively); the beach sample exhibits a result of 2.700, while 

tsunami samples show results within the 1.920 to 2.800 range; the dunes present values of 1.524 and 1.560 

(P6 and P8 respectively) while Duna_Trep (and all other remaining samples) show values under 1.15. In 

what concerns dissolution features, it was observed that samples with values &amp;lt;1 are tsunami sample SS3 

and proximal nearshore samples (-5m and -7.5m). Moreover, the other tsunami samples (SAM and SAO) 

present values for dissolution of 1.500 and 1.520, respectively. The highest values registered for dissolution 

were obtained in one nearshore (-10m) and two alluvial samples, with values above 3.5. Regarding adhering 

particles, dunes showed results around 2, while tsunami and beach samples exhibited values between 1.100 

and 1.560. Alluvial samples, Duna_Trep and all nearshore sediments (except -5m and -7.5) present results 

for adhering particles above 3.0. Furthermore, percussion marks are present in all tsunami samples above

ca. 3 with the highest value obtained for sample SS3, (3.600). Beach and proximal nearshore samples (-5m 

and -7.5m) exhibit values of 2.800, 3.000 and 2.545, respectively. Moreover, dune samples show values 

around 1.250, except sample Duna_Trep with a value of 0.833. Alluvial samples present the lowest values 

observed, with 0.333 (i.e. Lag_Bds) and 0.400 (Alv_Dirt).

 In terms of microtextural analysis, results described above can be summarized as follows: 

- Nearshore samples can be divided in two groups (proximal and distal samples). The latter presents 

very high values for angularity and fresh surfaces and extremely low values for adhering particles 

and dissolution, whereas distal samples present exactly the opposite. 

- Beach sample revealed high values for angularity, fresh surfaces and percussion marks. 

- Dune samples presented a well-balanced range of values for all characteristics studied although 

sample Duna_Trep revealed a higher content of dissolution and adhering particles, thus suggesting 

a different (older) age or more intense pedogenetic reworking when compared with the two other 

dune samples (P6 and P8). 

- Tsunami samples presented angularity corresponding to ca. 2.250, very high results for fresh 

surfaces and the highest value for percussion marks. 

- Alluvial samples presented low values for fresh surfaces and percussion marks but exhibited the 

highest values for dissolution and adhering particles. 

 

No unequivocal spatial trend could be established except among the nearshore samples.

5.2.5. Heavy mineral features 

Heavy mineral content in samples from Boca do Rio was analysed (Table 5.2.3). Tsunami samples 

presented values of 0.168% (i.e. SAM), 0.212% (i.e. SS3) and 0.070% (i.e. SAO) thus not allowing the 

establishment of any spatial trend. The beach sample (i.e. Face) and the Duna_Trep sample presented 

values of ca. 0.35% and 0.38% (the highest observed), respectively. All the remaining samples (all 

nearshore samples and two dune samples – P6 and P8) presented much lower percentage (&lt;0.07%) for 

heavy mineral fraction in total sediment. 

In compositional terms all samples presented more than 75% of andalusite, staurolite and 

tourmaline with pyroxene and amphiboles also present (Figure 5.2.10 and Table 5.2.4). All nearshore 

samples presented more than 25% of andalusite with the exception of sample -10m (i.e. 19.737%). Beach 

and dune samples presented results in the range 22% to 24%, except sample Duna_Trep with a result of 

31.21%. Tsunami samples exhibited values in the range of 22% to 28% while alluvial samples showed a 

result of 19.12%. Staurolite results allowed a more clear differentiation due to the fact that all nearshore 

samples presented values above 15%, alluvial sample has 22.794% while face and dune samples presented 

values of ca. 14.5% (except Duna_Trep with 17.197%). On the other hand tsunami samples revealed values 

within the range 10.156% and 15.172%. In the case of tourmaline spatial trends could be inferred: in the 

nearshore samples it is visible a decrease in the percentage of tourmaline with decreasing distance to the 

coast while in the tsunami samples the percentage of tourmaline increases inland. In fact, all nearshore 

samples exhibited results below 50% while beach and dunes (except Duna_Trep with 42%) displayed 

values around ca. 50% which are similar to the percentage obtained for tourmaline in tsunami samples.

 Alluvial sample presented a value of 40.441% of tourmaline. In what regards pyroxene it was 

observed that all nearshore samples presented results above 7% while beach and dune exhibited values in 

the 4.45%-5.50% range. Tsunami samples seem to decrease its content in pyroxene inland with values 

varying from 4.138% to 8.462%. Amphiboles are rare in nearshore samples and absent in beach sample. 

Amphiboles present its maximum value in the alluvial sample with a 3.676% presence. In what concerns 

other minerals (e.g. zircon, garnet, olivine, epidote, monazite, rutile and sphene), it can be observed that 

dune, beach and tsunami samples presented similar values (i.e. dune and beach ca. 3.5% while tsunami 

exhibited values in the range of 3.454% to 5.390%). Nearshore samples presented values below 1.761% 

except sample -5m that displayed a result of 3.156% for the presence of other minerals. Alluvial sample 

revealed the highest value for the presence of other minerals with a result of 5.886%. 

 As a summary, it can be perceived that tsunami samples share more similarities in terms of heavy 

mineral percentage compositional content (i.e. andalusite, staurolite, tourmaline and other minerals) with 

dune and beach samples than with any other group of samples (i.e nearshore or alluvial samples). Staurolite 

apparently allowed the differentiation of environments except for sample Duna_Trep.

5.3. Voe of Scatsta 

5.3.1. Lithostratigraphic features 

In the location of Voe of Scatsta, the erosion of peat by the sea exposed along the coast a cliffed 

outcrop of ca. 2m high. Within the lower part of that peat, there is an approximately 0.10m thick, wide-spread 

massive sand layer, which overlies 0.30m of peat. The sand layer is more or less continuous for more than 

150m both alongshore and inland. Several cores were collected in this region and two of those cores SHT_1 

and SHT_3, taken from the walls of trenches located less than 50m apart and aligned cross shore, were 

studied in more detail (Figure 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Two samples from each core were analysed; one 

correspondent to the base of the sandy deposit and a second sample (in each core) located above the 

previous one and close to the top contact of the sand unit but still within it. 

 

 

Figure 5.3.1 – Location of cores obtained in Voe of Scatsta, Shetland Islands. 

 

Both studied cores presented similar lithostratigraphies (Figure 5.3.3). The exposed trench walls 

revealed a basal peat unit of ca. 0.30m. This unit is overlaid by a medium to coarse sand layer with an 

erosional contact at the base and an uncorformity at the top of the unit. Moreover, this unit also exhibited

some centimetric pebbles and rare cobbles although it did not present very rich shell content. On top of this 

sandy unit, a peat layer, sharing many of the characteristics of the basal unit, is present. The top 0.10m are 

composed of dark brown soil with many roots and plant fragments.

The proposed chronology for this sandy layer and its association with a specific tsunamigenic event 

will be discussed in the following chapter based in radiocarbon dates obtained by other authors (Bondevik et 

al., 2005; Dawson et al., 2006). 

 

5.3.2. Textural features 

Grain-size distribution and parameters were measured and the vertical and horizontal variation in 

textural propertied were measured in all samples (Table 5.3.1). The coarse sediment consists of medium to 

coarse, moderately sorted, quartziferous sand. Samples reveal contrasting behaviour in terms of vertical 

trends for 1%?, 10% ?, 90% ?, mean, mode and median. While the sediment in core SHT_1 display a fining 

upward trend, core SHT_3 reveals a coarsening upward sequence, although the low number of samples 

constrains further interpretations and extrapolations of these results. On the other hand, only kurtosis 

exhibits an identical pattern in both cores (SHT_1 and SHT_3), the values being higher at the base of the 

unit. 

In terms of horizontal variation, the sample closest to the shoreline (SHT_1) is slightly coarser at the 

base and also when averaging the mean values obtained for each sample pair, but the top sand in each 

core shows an opposite trend. Standard deviations are almost identical in all samples. Thus, textural data 

did not allow the establishment of any consistent trend of vertical or horizontal variation in grain size.

In terms of micromorphological changes (Figure 5.3.4) the major changes observed were related with the 

size of clasts and grains (consistently smaller towards the top of the unit), this trend being accompanied by 

the decrease in abundance of plant fragments and by decrease in the voids (higher compaction of the 

sediment at the base of the deposit).

5.3.3. Morphoscopy features 

Morphoscopic characteristics were measured in samples from core SHT_1 and SHT_3. Results are 

summarized in Figures 5.3.5, 5.3.6 and 5.3.7. In compositional terms it was possible to observe that a very 

high percentage of quartz was detected [i.e. from 50% in sample SHT_3_(23-25) up to 65% in sample 

SHT_1_(22-24)]. Moreover, one should take into account that (contrary to the cases of Lagoa dos Salgados 

and Boca do Rio) the bioclasts observed were essentially (&gt;90%) plant fragments and not carbonate shells. 

Samples from core SHT_3 presented less bioclasts (ca. 10%) than samples from core SHT_1 (ca. 25%). 

Moreover, it was also possible to detect that the percentage of lithic material is higher at the base of the unit 

when compared with overlying samples (the difference between base and top varying between 6% and 

12%).  

In terms of roundness of the quartz grains observed (Figure 5.3.6) it was possible to observe that 

the well-rounded and rounded grains are typically present in percentages around 60% to 65% and are more 

frequent at the base of the sand in both cores. Very angular and angular grains are more frequent at the top 

samples in each core, with values between 15% and 20%. 

 Regarding shape (Figure 5.3.7), the results show that spherical grains were more frequently found 

(7% in SHT_1 and 3% in SHT_3) at the base of the sand unit, whereas more discoid grains showed more 

frequently at the top. In terms of shape all samples presented values within a narrow range.

  As a summary, it can be said that morphoscopy was not totally conclusive in the 

establishment of vertical or horizontal trends with the exception of the presence of more lithic material at the 

base of the high-energy sandy deposit and more angular grains at the top. 

 

5.3.4. Microtextural features 

The vertical variation in microtextural features was assessed in tsunamigenic sediment from the 

Voe of Scatsta (Figure 5.3.8 and Table 5.3.2). It was possible to detect that angularity increases towards the 

top, particularly in core SHT_3. In terms of fresh surfaces the samples studied displayed values in the range 

2.0 [SHT_1_(22-24)] to 3.3 [i.e. SHT_3_(22-25)]. Dissolution features are higher at the base than at the top 

of the tsunamigenic unit in both cores (1.2 to 3.3 in core SHT_1 and 1.8 to 2.5; top and base respectively). 

Regarding adhering particles the values obtained were very high in sample SHT_1_(22-24, with 4.4) while 

the other samples yielded results in the range of 1.4 to 1.1 for adhering particles. On the other hand, results 

obtained for percussion marks results were similar within each core but contrasting between core SHT_1 

and SHT_3, with the latter presenting significantly lower values. 

The microtextural analysis of the four samples retrieved from the Voe of Scatsta shows that these proxies 

are to some extent useful to highlight vertical variation of features within the tsunamigenic unit.

5.3.5. Heavy mineral features 

Heavy mineral assemblage was studied in four samples from cores SHT_1 and SHT_3. In terms of 

the percentage of heavy minerals in total sediment it was possible to differentiate the two cores SHT_1 

(values of 0.52% to 0.59%) and SHT_3 (values of 0.826% and 0.827%- virtually identical) (Table 5.3.3).

SHT_3 0.22-0.25 0.826 

SHT_3 0.25-0.28 0.827 

 

 The heavy mineral assemblages of samples from cores SHT_1 and cores SHT_3 are strongly 

dominated by amphiboles with a presence of more than 88.95% (Figure 5.3.9 and Table 5.3.4). This mineral 

is also more frequent at the basal samples in each core. By contrast, andalusite exhibited smaller results for 

the basal samples (3.302% and 2.941%, for SHT_1 and SHT_3, respectively) when compared with overlying 

samples (5.233% and 5.128%, for SHT_1 and SHT_3, respectively). Pyroxene and garnet did not 

demonstrate any clear vertical trend and showed very low values of less than 1.80%. Other minerals (e.g. 

zircon, silimanite and staurolite) revealed presence of around 2.3% with the exception of sample 

SHT_3_(25-28) with 1.291%. 

 Heavy mineral assemblages contributed to the establishment of vertical trends within the sandy 

deposit, although the low number of samples might constrain generalizations.

5.4. Lhok Nga 

5.4.1. Lithostratigraphic features 

Samples used in this study were collected a few weeks after the tsunami event of 26 December 

2004. Figure 5.4.1 illustrates the spatial distribution of the samples retrieved: two samples from present-day 

analogues (i.e. nearshore and beach) and four locations corresponding to a sampling profile inland (NGA_2, 

NGA_7, NGA_9 and NGA_18). It is important to note that locations NGA_2 and NGA_7 yielded more than 

one sample of the tsunamigenic sediment and were collected to assess vertical variations within it. 

 

 

Figure 5.4.1 - Location maps of the Lhok Nga Bay and collected samples (Paris et al., 2007). 

 

The 2004 tsunami deposits in this area consist of medium to coarse, greyish to yellowish sands, 

which display lateral variations in thickness and grain-size and vertical variations in texture. The deposits 

settled on top of brown sandy soils, dune sands or beachrock near the coast, reddish fluvial sands in the 

rivers, and dark brown silty soil in the rice paddies (Paris et al., 2007). The lower contact of the tsunami unit 

is abrupt or erosional when in contact with underlying sand. The thickness of the tsunami deposits 

decreases landward. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

146 
 

In Lhok Nga, the tsunami deposit displayed stratification into distinct layers in some sampling 

locations, and in cases up to 15 layers could be distinguished in the field. Typically, the basal layers are 

coarser and massive and separated by thin mud lines (in cross section) from the upper part that is usually 

finer. A landward increasing content of rip-up clasts of the locally underlying soil, roots, wood, leaves and 

anthropic clasts (glass, brick, metal, plastic, etc.) was detected. 

In some trenches the topmost layer was considered as the backwash deposit, when it is coarser than the 

lower normally-graded couplet of layers (e.g. NGA_2G and NGA_7F). 

The schematic lithostratigraphy (including all the samples used in this study) is described in Figure 

5.4.2. 

 

 

Figure 5.4.2 - Sequence stratigraphy and interpretation of the vertical trends along the Lhok Nga transect (Paris et al., 
2007). 

 

5.4.2. Textural features 

Based in the mean grain size (Table 5.4.1), all samples are within the medium to coarse sand 

interval (except NGA_18). Furthermore, using samples NGA_2A, NGA_7C, NGA_9A and NGA_18 is 

possible to establish a decreasing inland grain-size trend. For the same samples it can also be observed 

that NGA_18 (farther inland) presents the smaller mean grain size 2.10 ?. 

The backwash samples NGA_2G and NGA_7F exhibit an opposite trend with finer material 

(NGA_2G = 0.78 ?; NGA_7F = 0.42 ?) closer to the coast.

5.4.3. Morphoscopy features 

Morphoscopic analysis was conducted in samples from Lhok Nga and results are shown as figures 

to visualize spatial distribution (Figure 5.4.3, 5.4.4 and 5.4.5). 

In compositional terms (Figure 5.4.3), samples from Lhok Nga, reveal quartz content in the range of 

35% to 45%, except samples NGA_2G with the higher value of 50.0% and NGA_7F with the lower value of 

28.1%; interestingly both samples represent backwash sediment. Regarding lithic material, the values are 

consistently within the 15%-20% range, except for samples NGA_7C and NGA_18 with 8.57% and 11.61% 

respectively. The carbonate bioclasts are present typically in percentage of ca. 45% with two exceptions, 

both backwash samples, presenting contrasting values (55.2% for sample NGA_7F and 33.7% for sample 

NGA_2G, respectively the highest and the lowest values observed). 

Quartz grains from samples studied were classified in terms of roundness (Figure 5.4.3) and 

sphericity (Figure 5.4.4). Sediment deposited by backwash presented the higher values of well-rounded and 

rounded grains (11% and 37%, respectively NGA_2G and NGA_7F) whereas all other samples presented 

results of less than 9%. In terms of very angular and angular grains the highest values were observed in 

sand at the base of trench 2 (NGA_2A), 9 (NGA_9A) and 18 (NGA_18) with values of 83.3%, 78.4% and 

87.2% respectively. On the other hand spherical grains represent less than 6% in all samples, except the 

backwash sediment (NGA_2G and NGA_7F) with 10.9% and 20.0%, respectively. The grains also revealed 

a well-balanced distribution between prismatic and discoid shapes. 

As a summary it can be concluded that morphoscopic results slightly contributed to the 

differentiation of samples of the base of the tsunamigenic unit (roundness characteristics) and of the 

backwash (percentage of bioclasts and sphericity characteristics).

5.4.4. Microtextural features 

Microtextural features were observed and classified in samples from Lhok Nga. Regarding 

angularity, the samples present higher values inland (e.g. NGA_9A=4.00) but no consistent spatial trend 

could be established. Samples from trench NGA_2 exhibit increasing values towards the top of the 

tsunamigenic unit but the same pattern is not present in trench NGA_7. In terms of fresh surfaces, it was 

observed that all samples displayed results &amp;lt;3, except in the case of backwash sediment (NGA_2G, with a 

result of 3.571 and NGA_7F with a result of 3.429) and sample NGA_7C with a result of 3.276. In trenches 

NGA_2 and NGA_7 it was observed that fresh surfaces increase towards the top of the tsunamigenic unit. 

Values of dissolution features are extremely low (i.e.&amp;lt;1.6) in all cases, except for samples NGA_18 and 

NGA_nearshore (the latter presenting the highest value). In what respects adhering particles it was 

observed that the highest values (above 4.3) were noticed in the nearshore and beach sample with the lower 

values being obtained in the NGA_2A and NGA_2F samples (1.938 and 1.357, respectively). Percussion 

marks increase to the top in trenches NGA_2 and NGA_7, and the highest value was observed in sample 

NGA_7F (backwash, result of 1.643), while the lowest value was yielded by sample NGA_18 (0.010). 

Microtextural results solely reveal vertical variations within the tsunamigenic unit in fresh surfaces and 

percussion marks (increasing to the top) and that the highest values were identified in the sediment 

deposited by backwash.

5.4.5. Heavy mineral features 

In terms of heavy mineral content in total sediment (Table 5.4.3) the studied samples from Lhok 

Nga exhibited extremely low values (&lt;0.001%) in all samples.

In terms of heavy mineral assemblage (Figure 5.4.7 and Table 5.4.4), it was observed that 

amphiboles is the more frequent mineral specimen although presenting a wide range of values from 47.500 

(i.e. NGA_18) up to 85.976% (i.e. NGA_7C). In what concerns andalusite, it was observed that the highest 

results were observed in the sample closest to the coastline (i.e. NGA_2A) and in the sample farther inland 

(i.e. NGA_18) with 35.294% and 38.750%, respectively. The minimum value observed in percentage of 

andalusite was in sample NGA_7C. Regarding pyroxene, presented its higher values in samples NGA_2A 

(i.e. 7.843%) and NGA_18 (i.e. 2.500%) while its lower results were registered in samples NGA_7C (i.e. 

0.610%) and NGA_9A (i.e. 0.962%). Samples NGA_2G (backwash sample) presented more zircon (i.e. 

4.065%) and garnet (i.e. 2.439%) than the other samples that exhibited values of less than 3% and 2%, with 

the exception of sample NGA_18 that showed values of 2.500% and 7.500% for garnet and zircon, 

respectively. Other minerals were not observed in this group of samples. No peculiar vertical or horizontal 

heavy mineral assemblage trend was evident in this group of samples.

5.5. Stoneybridge 

5.5.1. Lithostratigraphic features 

A tempestite sandy deposit retrieved immediately after the Great Storm of the 11th of January of 

2005 was used in this research. The storm damage was particularly felt by the south-facing coastal areas in 

South Uist and Benbecula (Hebrides Islands) which experienced the severest storm wave activity during this 

January 2005 storm. Near Stoneybridge (Figure 5.5.1), a beach ridge was breached by the waves, resulting 

in widespread flooding inland together with the deposition of fans of gravel and sand some of which are up 

to 35 cm in thickness (Angus and Rennie, 2007). This discontinuous (medium to fine sand) unit, with varying 

thickness, was recognised up to 150m landward of the coastal dunes and are draped over the machair. 

In the core used in this study (Figure 5.5.2) a 0.10m thick sand layer was recovered and four 

samples (at different depth in that core) were used in all sedimentological analyses that are presented 

below.

5.5.2. Textural features 

Grain-size parameters were measured in the four samples collected in Stoneybridge (Table 5.5.1). 

The samples are all composed of fine sand and the mean grain-size is  of ca. 2.45 ?, except sample 

HB_(0.05-0.06) that is slightly coarser (2.1 ?). The standard deviation is similar in all samples with the 

lowest value of 0.36 ? in the top sample and the highest value of 0.58 ? in sample HB_(0.05-0.06). Kurtosis 

revealed decreases towards the top of the unit. It was also noticed that base and top of the tempestite 

present identical median values.

5.5.3. Morphoscopy features 

Morphoscopic characteristics were observed in four samples from the tempestites retrieved from 

Stoneybridge (Figure 5.5.3, 5.5.4, 5.5.5 and 5.5.6). The samples are dominated by variable but generally 

high abundance of bioclasts, around 45% (mainly dominated by plant fragments but also with infrequent 

shell material). The top presented 60% of bioclasts wheareas the base yielded 70% of bioclasts. On the

other hand, quartz occurs in proportions of ca. 30%, except in the base of the unit with 15%. All samples 

present low percentage of lithic materials (app. 20%) although the base of the unit displayed 7% and the top 

14% in lithics. Figure 5.5.4 shows the roundness classification of grains from the storm deposit. The samples 

yielded low values for well-rounded and rounded grains, with 23.5% at the base and less than 6.7% in every 

other case. In what concerns very angular and angular grains they are especially abundant in samples 

HB_(0.05-0.06) and HB_(0.07-0.08) with 72% and 75%, the remaining samples exhibiting values above 

53%. Figure 5.5.5 displays the sphericity results obtained for the same group of samples. It is possible to 

observe that spherical samples are rare (less than 10% of grains) in two samples, HB_(0.05-0.06) and 

HB_(0.09-0.10),  this type of shape being  absent in all  remaining samples. The grains from the storm 

deposit are typically discoid or sub-discoid, occurring from base to top in percentages of 68%, 68%, 60% 

and 63%. 

In the case of the tempestite retrieved from the Hebrides no vertical trend was recognized solely 

based in this proxy.

5.5.4. Microtextural features 

Microtextural classification was conducted in samples from the storm deposit that was collected in 

Stoneybridge (Figure 5.5.6 and Table 5.5.2). Angularity exhibited high values (ca. 3.143 to 3.643) except the 

base of the unit that displayed a result of 2.212. In terms of fresh surfaces the highest values were observed 

in samples HB_(0.05-0.06) and HB_(0.07-0.08) with results of 2.500 and 2.000 respectively while the fewer 

fresh surfaces were measured in the basal sample. On the other hand, dissolution presented very high 

values (highest at the top and base of tempestite) and the lowest of 3.000 for sample HB_(0.07-0.08). 

Regarding adhering particles they present values of ca. 3.5 in the middle samples while the top and base of 

the deposit revealed values around 4.5. In what concerns, percussion marks the highest values of 0.643 was 

detected in sample HB_(0.05-0.06) while the lowest result of 0.083 was observed in sample HB_(0.07-0.08). 

 Microtextural data was not advantageous in establishing a vertical trend for the tempestite although 

it was clear that the base and top of the deposit exhibited contrasting results with the other tempestite 

samples (except for percussion marks).

5.5.5. Heavy mineral features 

Heavy mineral assemblages for the tempestite were studied with the purpose of establish, if 

possible, vertical trends. In terms of the percentage of heavy minerals in total sediment it was clear an 

increase to the top of the unit (varying from 0.257%, at the top, to 2.604%, at the base) (Table 5.5.3).

 In compositional terms (Figure 5.5.7 and Table 5.5.4) no trend was established based in 

percentage variation of the main mineralogical components of these samples. The tempestite samples were 

mainly composed by amphiboles (&gt;79.352%) with the highest result obtained for sample HB_(0.05-0.06) 

with 86.555% of the sample. Andalusite exhibited its highest value (i.e. 6.047%) for the base of the deposit 

and its lowest value (i.e. 1.619%) for sample HB_(0.07-0.08). In what concerns pyroxene, the highest value 

was displayed by sample HB_(0.07-0.08) with 11.741% and the lowest value by sample HB_(0.05-0.06) with 

5.882%. Garnet and other minerals (e.g. monazite, epidote, staurolite, silimanite and zircon) were also 

detected in percentages ranging respectively between 2.521%-4.858% and 0.475%-2.436%, respectively. 

 Heavy mineral assemblages were not successful in the establishment of clear patterns within the 

whole deposit.

6. Discussion 

6.1. Textural signatures of extreme marine inundations 

All studied areas present a peculiar/unique lithostratigraphic signature in the top of each sites 

Holocene sequence. These signatures are found in sediment units that are correlatable with specific 

extreme marine inundations that affected each location. The dates of inundations were obtained through the 

extrapolation of radiocarbon ages, the computation of sedimentation rates based in radionuclides decay rate 

or in previous work conducted in the studied or nearby areas. 

A conspicuous erosional/unconformity basal contact, generally observed in tsunamigenic deposits 

reported in the literature and indicative of the energetic character of the events responsible for their 

deposition, was observed in all studied areas and was also detected in the tempestite storm deposit of 

Stoneybridge, thus in accordance with Switzer (2008) that also recognized a sharp basal contact in storm 

deposits in Australia. Moreover, and also revealing the high energy involved, rip-up clasts were detected in 

all tsunamigenic units but were absent in the storm deposit. In cases, the amount of  erosion of the 

underlying layers may have been considerable (e.g. in Salgados, erosion may have removed sediment 

accumulated throughout  at least 800 cal years, calculated after radiocarbon dates of top unit D and base of 

unit F). These observations are in agreement with the findings of Minoura and Nakaya (1991), Bondevik et 

al. (1997), Nanayama et al. (2000) and Dawson and Stewart (2007) that correlate the presence of intraclasts 

ripped from soft underlying units with the enormous erosive capacity associated with a tsunami inundation. 

In agreement with Phantuwongraj and Choowong (2011), rip-up clasts are rare or absent in storm deposits 

probably due to the dominance of the inflow sedimentation and especially the constrasting intensity and 

duration of each inundation pulse. 

The enrichment in broken shells of marine bivalves and also of tests and valves of both foraminifera 

and ostracods, which is another peculiar feature commonly observed in tsunamigenic deposits (e.g. Moore 

and Moore 1988; Bryant et al. 1992; Albertão and Martins 1996; Imamura et al. 1997; Clague et al., 1999; 

Donato et al., 2008), was only clearly perceived in the Portuguese and Indonesian samples and was not 

detected in the Scottish case, probably due to contrasting specific biological associations, taphonomical 

constrains and hydrodynamic conditions. In fact, the interpretation of the Scottish sedimentary sequences 

(from sediments of the tsunami and characterizing the permanent regime) relies essentially upon diatom 

proxies, which are extremely rare in the Portuguese case. 

All deposits addressed exhibited a clear inland-thinning trend although conditioned by specific 

palaeotopographic characteristics, reaching distances in the order of 3 km away from the coast. In 

agreement with the findings of Gelfenbaum et al. (2007), tsunami deposits in Salgados, Boca do Rio and 

Lhok Nga were thicker in topographic lows (areas of spatial flow deceleration ) and thin over topographic 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

highs (areas of spatial flow acceleration). Furthermore, in all studied sites, macroscopic observations 

performed in the field at the scale of the outcrops or exposures remarked fining upward tendencies although, 

in cases, the laboratory processing of samples failed to confirm this feature, probably due to the presence of 

scattered gritt, large shell and/or plant fragments, occasionally captured in the small subsamples used for 

lab analyses. 

Although turbulent flows such as the ones associated with tsunami inundations are intrinsically 

chaotic and, by consequence, the associated processes of deposition and erosion are complex and varied at 

short time and spatial scales, it is possible to find some consistency in assess the grain-size characteristics 

of the depositional product and attempt to establish likely source materials. 

In Salgados, the sediment grain size of the tsunami layer decreases inland and upwards typically 

within one ? interval, in all samples where that layer is thicker than 0.03m. At the inland edge of the deposit, 

the sediment thickness is typically less than 0.03m; here, the sand is finer and shows poorer sorting (larger  

standard deviations); the mean grain-size of the whole sediment markedly drops, mainly due to three 

reasons: decrease in size of the coarser fraction, enrichment in mud (either contemporaneous of the 

depositon or induced by post-deposition illuviation) and sampling limitations, i.e. difficulty in retrieving a very 

thin layer of tsunami sediment with ghosty contacts preventing contamination by the framing muddy 

sediment. The same difficulty applies to other locations worldwide, though it has rarely been made explicit by 

the authors, and should be taken in consideration in interpretations of existing and future studies. 

A pronounced contrast in the content of sand and consequently of the mean grain size (see Figure 

6.1 for example) is detectable at the very base of all studied units laid down by extreme marine inundations, 

when compared with the underlying materials. Moreover, further upward in the high-energy sandy units, the 

sediment is virtually homogeneous in size or normally graded (with the exception of Lhok Nga, see below). 

This fact leads to the absence or to difficulties in identifying sedimentary structures besides a 

massive/chaotic character that is common to many tsunami deposits, hence in accordance with the 

suggestions previously forwarded by Dawson et al.(1995) and Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008).

The Indonesian tsunamigenic unit presented a complex stratigraphy with multiple coarser and finer 

laminae and layers correspondent to several waves of the 2004 tsunami. Furthermore, in Lhok Nga, very 

fine sediments were deposited as extremely thin mud drapes during periods of lower flow velocities, 

separating coarser sub-units associated with different wave pulses or backwashes. In the case of Lhok Nga, 

as discussed by Paris et al. (2007), normally-graded couplets or triplets of layers were used to identify the 

run-up of each wave. Furthermore, the topmost layer was interpreted as backwash deposition (presenting a 

seaward decrease in mean grain-size). This very recent tsunamigenic deposit is unique in that, it exhibits 

clear textural constrasts and accumulated texturally-distinguishable sub-units throughout the depocenter 

region, in contrast with many other tsunamigenic deposits, either the ones studied here or others reported in 

the literature; this fact might suggest that sedimentary structures and sub-units such as the ones preserved 

in Lhok Nga may actually have formed elsewhere but were rapidly degraded or homegeneized, thus 

contributing to enhance the massive character of the deposits. This is in agreement with the findings of 

Szczucinski (2011) who observed the progressive disappearence of sedimentary structures and features 

from the same locations and sediment layers in 5 consecutive yearly campaigns in a study of the 2004 

Indian Ocean tsunami deposition. The reasoning above should be present when inferences on the number 

of waves or vectorial properties of the flow are straightforwardly taken from sedimentary units deposited by 

old inundation events. 

Tsunami deposits can vary immensely from location to location, mainly due to regional to local 

geological, geomorphological and climate constrains, all of which play a part in determining differences in 

sediment sources. Grain-size variation in tsunamiites is determined by the dimensional range of sediment 

available for transport, rather than by flow capacity (Bourgeois, 2009), maybe with the only exception of 

gigantic megaclats, which require exceptional flow conditions. In the sedimentary units addressed in this 

study (Table 6.2) the mean grain size roughly correspond to fine to medium sand although, as mentioned 

above, sampling limitations, occasional shell or plant fragments may have influenced the laboratory results, 

due to the fact that they are not hydraulic equivalents of the lithic or mineralogical grains with which they 

coexist in the sediment. The tsunamiite from Salgados (once more where its thickness exceeds 0.03m) 

presents essentially an unimodal grain size distribution, which suggests predominance of one sedimentary 

source. The same pattern was observed in all other studied areas, except Lhok Nga. Indeed, Paris et al. 

(2007) used textural data to suggest that in Lhok Nga the 2004 Indian tsunami deposit may have been 

nourished from the beach with relevant contributions from the shallow shelf, the coral reef, the lagoons and 

the dunes. 

All sites addressed in this study other than Lhok Nga yielded high energy sediment with standard 

deviation roughly below 1 ? thus suggesting that the source material was probably well sorted and normally 

distributed. This is in accordance with Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) that analysed the grain-size distributions 

of tsunami materials deposited by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian and Kenyan coasts. Moreover, those 

deposits were essentially characterized by symmetrical or slightly positively-skewed size distributions and 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

this was interpreted as confirming that the tsunami sediment was entrained from well sorted pre-tsunami 

materials available in the nearshore and beach environments. In the case of Lagoa dos Salgados, a similar 

pattern was detected in the size distribution of sediments from both unit E and dune/beach material from 

present-day analogues. Tsunamiites and tempestite from Portugal and Scotland exhibit a slightly positive 

kurtosis (leptokurtic curves), which, according to Bahlburg and Weiss (2006), might suggest a limited size-

interval of the source material, in contrast with a platykurtic kurtosis reported by Paris et al. 2007 indicating 

multiple sediment sources in Lhok Nga. 

 Numerous authors attempted to use textural parameters to differentiate sedimentary environments 

or transport mechanisms with controversial results (e.g. Mason and Folk, 1958; Friedman, 1961; Shepard 

and Young, 1961; Visher, 1969; McLaren, 1981; McLaren and Bowes, 1985). In the case of Salgados 

(where a larger number of samples were collected from nearshore, beach and dune) this was crudely 

achieved using the 10% ? and 90% ? percentiles and skewness (Table 6.1) of the grain size distribution. 

Nearshore samples presented the largest standard deviation thus exhibiting larger differences between 

values for 10% ? and 90% ? percentiles. As a result of their study of sediments in Brazos River bar, Texas, 

Mason and Folk (1958) concluded that skewness is sensitive to transport and depositional environment. In 

their study case, beach samples were negatively skewed while dunes were positively skewed. Friedman 

(1961) confirmed these findings. Our results in Salgados do not corroborate those conclusions (Table 6.1). 

Moreover, McLaren (1981) concluded that mean grain size, sorting and skewness are dependent of the 

source of the deposit and independent of transportation process or sedimentary environment. Our results 

validate this conclusion due to higher similarities found between tsunamiites and dune and beach samples. 

In the case of Salgados and Boca do Rio it is also evident that the eroded underlying (finer-grained) unit was 

also a relevant sedimentary contributor for the tsunamigenic layer in both studied areas. 

On the other hand, McLaren and Bowles (1985) concluded that sedimentary deposits may become 

either: a) coarser, better sorted, and more positively skewed (in high energy transport) or finer, better sorted; 

or b) more negatively skewed (in low energy regime). In the Salgados case, tsunami samples are more 

positively skewed (mean value of 0.167) than their likely source material (Table 6.1); thus, according to 

McLaren and Bowles (1985) model, this textural shift indicates a source-deposit relation and confirms the 

high energy character of the transport agent responsible for the emplacement of the tsunamigenic unit. 

Friedman (1967) questioned if grain size analysis will ever be helpful in environmental 

interpretation. Our conclusion is that if a given deposit is related to more than one source, it is extremely 

difficult to use mean grain size, sorting or skewness as useful sedimentological tools in the differentiation of 

the parental material source. Our textural data confirmed what has been commonly reported elsewhere for 

sediment entrained, transported and deposited by tsunami waves: they transport essentially sediment that is 

available in the coastal fringe (e.g. Dawson 1994; Moore et al. 1994; Atwater and Moore, 1992; Clague and 

Bobrowsky, 1994; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson, 2004; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009;

6.2. Morphoscopic signatures of extreme marine inundations 

Every sedimentary environment is characterized by specific energy conditions, which vary in time 

and space, those fluctuations representing temporary shifts, departures, from modal conditions that define 

the permanent regime. The results obtained in this study show that the contrasting energetic character and 

transport mechanisms associated with tsunamigenic events and the nearshore hydrodynamics, including 

occasional high energy storm events, translate into compositional characteristics, roundness and sphericity 

attributes of sediment particles. In the case of Salgados, principal component analysis reveals that it is 

possible to distinguish nearshore and tsunami sediments in compositional terms. In Figure 6.2, tsunamis 

samples are positively correlated with the percentage of quartz (right hemisphere) whereas, by contrast, 

nearshore samples are grouped in association with larger representation of bioclasts and lithic material. This 

indicates that the coastal dune and beach were the main sedimentary source of the tsunami sediments in 

contrast with the nearshore environment which, despite the sand abundance, contributed with little material 

to that particular deposit. 

 Roundness varies with the size-class considered within the same detritic sediment, so by 

concentrating the analysis in one size fraction, common to different samples, comparability between data 

was maintained. Results obtained in this study from Salgados and Boca do Rio are not in agreement with 

Hails (1967) which state that it is impossible to distinguish between beach and dune sands exclusively by 

considering roundness. In fact, the differentiation of these two sedimentary environments (i.e. beach and 

dune) is illustrated by higher roundness characteristics of dune samples (right quadrants – Figure 6.3 and 

6.5) in contrast with more angular grains in beach sediment (left quadrants – Figures 6.3 and 6.5). In 

accordance with Beal and Shepard (1956) the difference in roundness between dune and beach sediments 

is only relative rather than absolute, which recommends caution in the interpretation of results if this proxy is 

solely used in reconstructing paleoenvironments in stratigraphic studies. The latter authors also concluded 

that quartz grains in dunes were more rounded than in adjacent beaches and attributed that difference 

mainly to selective sorting by wind transport rather than abrasion, as inferred by many other authors. 

Kumbrein (1941) suggested that in Nature there is a close correlation between sphericity and 

roundness of clastic particles, although these attributes are conceptually independent. With a given distance 

of transport, roundness changes more significantly than sphericity because roundness is more sensitive to 

small-scaled features (i.e. edges of grains) whereas sphericity is more dependent of the major dimensional 

ratio, which requires much more energy to change, hence being a function of source (Mason and Folk, 

1958). In Salgados and Boca do Rio (Figure 6.4 and 6.6), sphericity was only able to be of practical use in 

the former case, nearshore samples tending to group in the right quadrant, in opposition with all remaining 

samples. 

In conclusion, based in morphoscopic features of quartz grains studied, it was possible to establish 

likely sources and differentiate sedimentary environments. However, the differences are essentially 

qualitative and critical reserve should be applied when analysing and interpreting results elsewhere. In 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

168 
 

Salgados (Figure 6.2 and 6.4), it was clear both through the compositional pattern, as well as considering 

sphericity, that nearshore samples share the less affinity with tsunamiite samples. Furthermore, in Salgados 

it was also possible to use roundness (Figure 6.3) to differentiate more angular (beach, nearshore, storm, 

tsunami) from more rounded (nearshore and dune) samples, thus allowing distinction between dune and 

beach samples. In Boca do Rio (Figure 6.5) it was possible to discriminate samples using roundness: 

samples with more angular grains [beach, tsunami, one proximal nearshore (-7.5 m)] cluster and plot 

separately from the rest of the studied sediments. On the other hand, sphericity (Figure 6.6) allowed 

separating nearshore from tsunami sands. Thus, these results suggest similar conclusions to the ones 

obtained in Salgados in terms of parental materials for the tsunami sediment: the nearshore region was the 

less likely sedimentary source of the AD 1755 tsunami that strongly affected these two coastal areas of the 

Algarve.

 In the Scottish areas, roundness and sphericity were not valid tools for discriminating sub-units 

within the tsunamiite or tempestite sediment layer, hence demonstrating that either the deposit was massive 

or that these proxies were not useful in these areas. Both arguments are effective, especially if considering 

the low number of samples used. By contrast, in Lhok Nga, roundness allowed clear differentiation of the 

sediment samples deposited by the tsunami backwash (see Figure 6.7 - left quadrants, backwash samples) 

whereas sphericity allowed discriminating the base of the deposit (Figure 6.8 - top quadrants). These results 

suggest that time played an important role in the rounding of grains because at the base of the deposit 

(inrushing water and sediment) they are more angular than in the backwash samples. This rounding could 

have occurred because of difference in sources (the backwash could have added an extra source supplying 

mature grains located inland) or by rapid smoothening or removal of edges and corners induced by effective 

grain-grain collisions during transport. The latter hypothesis raises questions in terms of the transport 

duration necessary to transform sand-sized angular quartz grains in more rounded ones. The issue has 

been debated for larger particles and there is a wide consensum that high-energy and turbulent transport is 

actually able to produce rapid changes of surface features in quartz particles (i.e. short-distance and 

evolution of roundness); however, in shallow marine environments, the roundness and luster characterizing 

quartz sand may essentially be acquired by pressure-induced near-bottom vibration induced by travelling 

waves, rather than impact between particles moving alongshore or cross shore and entrained, re-suspended 

and deposited by coastal currents. To what extent a high-density extremely turbulent flow saturated with 

suspended sand and moving inland at high speed, such as a tsunami, can be effective in producing similar 

reworking patterns of the grains surface, in a very short time-span, remains an open question. Although 

departing a bit from the central objectives of this dissertation, the question above is further discussed in the 

following sub-chapter of this thesis and the rationale, results and conclusions of an experiment addressing 

that issue may be found in Costa et al. (2012c). In three of the five studied areas, morphoscopic analysis 

proved to be a useful tool in the discrimination of environments and/or in the establishment of likely source 

material for extreme marine inundations.

6.3. Microtextural signatures of extreme marine inundations 

Several attempts (e.g. Krinsley and Margolis, 1969; Bettencourt et al., 1989; Pyokari, 1997; Abu-

Zeid et al., 2001; Mahaney et al., 2001; Bull and Morgan, 2006; Costa et al., 2009; Deane, 2010) have been 

made in order to characterize surface microscopic signatures in quartz  grains from distinct sedimentary 

environments. The results proposed have been controversial and far from unanimous in the identification of 

features, interpretation of inprinting mechanisms or processes, and association of specific microtextural 

signatures with specific sedimentary environments.  

Mahaney (2002) characterized a group of 41 microtextural features and suggested the association 

of some features with specific environments (e.g. percussion marks in aqueous environments; bulbous 

edges in aeolian environments); however, no grains associated with high energy inundation events were 

analysed in this study. By contrast, Krinsley and Donahue (1968) established that specific differences exist 

depending on the environment of transportation and deposition; however, they also suggested that river 

transport and turbidity current movement do not impress characteristic surface textures on quartz sand 

grains.  

Recently, Madhavaraju et al. (2009) examined quartz grains under the scanning electron 

microscope and defined thirty two distinct microtextures that they grouped into three modes of origin, i.e., 

mechanical (eighteen features), mechanical and/or chemical (five features) and chemical (seven features). 

Even in the same sedimentary environment, changes were detected. In agreement with these findings, 

Manickam and Barbaroux (1987) observed that in the Loire River (France) chemical features are dominant 

during winter while mechanical features dominate during the summer. Furthermore, Lisá (2004) detected 

that in the case of typical aeolian sediments; about 10% of the fraction studied will not show any surface 

microtextures typical of aeolian transport.  

One of the main problems in addressing these issues is the subjectivity and the discrepancy of 

observations made by different observers. In one attempt to verify operator variance, Culver et al. (1983) 

tested through five different observers the classification of eight samples and thirty two surface microtextural 

features and concluded that differences, although considerable in the recognition of individual surface 

features, were negligible in discrimination/grouping of samples. Although much has been done, one of the 

requirements that need to be addressed in the future is to standardize the definitions of microtextural 

features and in that sense the work by Mahaney (2002) should be used as the best available reference. 

Moreover, one tool that should be used to minimize the inter-observer incongruity is the use of wide-range 

statistical analyses. Mahaney et al. (2001) concluded that statistical measurements show the importance of 

grain overprinting and, in the opinion of the author, their use should be mandatory in grain surface 

microscopic studies. 

The analysis of microtexture box-plot diagrams (Figure 6.9) for each group of samples adressed in 

this study allowed identificating the characteristic features associated with each sedimentary environment.

The angularity parameter, although not being per se a distinctive microtextural differentiator (e.g. majority of 

grains are either sub-angular or sub-rounded), provides interesting data, with the highest median values for 

storm and beach grains but the highest values (more angular) are observed in tsunami grains that also 

present a wide range of values. 

Nearshore samples and alluvial samples exhibit the lowest median values of fresh surfaces, while the 

highest, as well as the broadest array values, have been observed in dune, beach and tsunami grains. 

Adhering particles and dissolution features present similar patterns with the highest median values for 

alluvial grains, although storm deposits also exhibit high values. Tsunami and beach presented lower 

median values and tsunami, storm and beach, once more, presented the widest range of values. 

In respect to percussion marks, the highest median values were observed in tsunami, dune and beach 

grains. However, tsunami grains yielded the highest values (above 3.5) suggesting a major resurfacing of 

the grain by this microtextural signature. 

The data analysed strongly suggest that a geographical signature is also present in sample 

grouping, thus indicating, at least partially, the permanency of a source signature, which may exhibit a 

considerable variation between the different coastal environments addressed. 

The tsunami grains are generally characterized by a large number of fresh surfaces (Indonesian 

samples presenting highest median values for fresh surfaces and angularity) (Figure 6.10). Moreover, the 

Scottish tsunami samples present strong dissolution (interpreted as post-depositional and favoured by a long 

post-event burial period) but the number of fresh surfaces that can be identified is still considerable. On the 

other hand, the Portuguese samples are characterized not only by larger numbers of fresh surfaces (when 

compared with potential source material: nearshore, beach, dune and alluvial) but also by the extremely 

abundant percussion marks including near total resurfacing of some grains. The Portuguese samples 

present a strong dominance of percussion-marks on grain surfaces (up to 50% of the population analysed), 

with an almost complete resurfacing of the grain. The Scottish (storm and tsunami) and Indonesian tsunami 

samples show clear dominance of fresh surfaces, even if masked by post-event dissolution (Shetland 

samples). 

Bivariate and ternary plots reveal differences and relationships between the samples studied in 

what relates microtextural imprints. One example is Figure 6.11, where percussion marks and dissolution 

are plotted. In this figure it is noticed that the vast majority of nearshore samples presented low values of 

percussion marks and high values of dissolution. The same pattern is observed in alluvial samples. On the 

other hand, beach samples show low dissolution and few percussion marks. By comparison, dunes present 

slightly higher values of dissolution and percussion marks. As observed in Figure 6.11, tsunami and storm 

samples exhibit a strong regional imprint. The Portuguese tsunami samples present high values of 

percussion marks and low values of dissolution, while tsunami samples from Indonesia and Shetland do not

present significant values of percussion marks but share low values of dissolution with the Portuguese 

tsunami samples.

Figure 6.10 – Comparison of microtextural (angularity; fresh surfaces; dissolution; adhering particles; percussion marks) 
results according to the location where the tsunami or storm samples were collected. 

 

In Figure 6.12 ternary plots were drawn and relationships between fresh surfaces, percussion 

marks, adhering particles or dissolution are observed. The relationship between fresh surfaces, percussion 

marks and dissolution is plotted in Figure 6.12A and it is possible to note that alluvial and nearshore samples 

typically present low values of fresh surfaces and percussion marks, but are characterized by high values of 

dissolution. By contrast, beach and tsunami samples present high values of fresh surfaces and low values of 

dissolution. The highest values of percussion marks can be observed in the Portuguese tsunami and storm 

samples. Moreover, in Figure 6.12B relationships between fresh surfaces, percussion marks and dissolution 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

features are apparent. This figure replicates the pattern exhibited by Figure 6.12A but is important to stress 

that nearshore and alluvial samples present high values of adhering particles and tsunami and beach 

samples present lower values. Dune samples (visible in both figures 6.12A and 6.12B) presented typical 

mean values in the microtextures observed. 

Principal components analysis allowed extracting the two main factors representing more than 80% 

of the total variability. Indeed, the orthogonal axes observed in Figure 6.13 are related with 4 major groups of 

microtextural features. Their association with the sedimentary samples can be observed in Figure 6.12. It is 

noted that Component 1 (x-axis in Figure 6.13) indicates  opposition between dissolution/adhering particles 

(component 1, positive values) and percussion marks and fresh surfaces (component 1, negative values), 

thus being a good indicator of the (hydro)dynamic conditions in the sedimentary environment. On the other 

hand, Component 2 (y-axis in Figure 6.13) depicts the opposition between percussion marks (top sector, 

positive values) and angularity (lower sector, negative values). Component 1 allows a clear differentiation 

between the two sets of microtextural families; one, more related with mechanical features (angularity, fresh 

surfaces and percussion marks, related with mechanical reworking processes) and another group of 

microtextures related with chemical processes (dissolution and adhering particles). As one can observe in 

Figure 6.13, in terms of sedimentary discrimination of environments, although a large majority of samples 

can be inserted in one specific quadrant (e.g. nearshore and alluvial samples on the top right quadrant; 

beach and tsunami samples are mostly present in the left quadrants; dune samples are mostly in the centre 

of the chart) there still is considerable variation of samples within each quadrant. 

From the above, we suggest that the use of only one microtexture to determine sedimentary 

environment is probably an invalid approach. After completing the analysis of our dataset we recommend 

that in the future one should use, at least, five microtextural features and a considerable number of grains. It 

is important to note geographical variations and to keep in mind that no sole microtexture can be applied 

worldwide to a unique sedimentary environment, although in the majority of environments there are some 

microtextural associations that are dominant. The group of five microtextural features described above 

allowed the characterization of several sedimentary environments as summarized below: 

Alluvial- High values of dissolution and adhering particles. Moderate presence of percussion marks. 

Beach- Highest percentage of fresh surface and strong presence of percussion marks. Dissolution and 

adhering particles are almost absent. 

Dune- Presents a well balance representation of all the microtextural features. 

Nearshore- High values of dissolution and adhering particles and moderate presence of percussion marks 

and fresh surfaces. 

Storm- Although a regional factor might influence the data (4 out 5 samples are from the Hebrides, 

Scotland), storm grains present many similarities with beach samples and can only be differentiated from 

those by the broadest variety of values observed. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

178 
 

Tsunami- Presents the highest values of percussion marks and fresh surfaces (thus suggesting strong 

hydrodynamic processes before deposition). Tsunami grains can also be characterized by presenting the 

widest range of values observed in the microtextural features. 

Although the number of samples is not perfectly balanced (lower number of samples for alluvial and 

storm samples; higher number of tsunami) these results suggest that it is possible to differentiate quartz 

grains from different sedimentary environments as long as it is possible to compare them to a representative 

set of grains from a specific study area.

In two of the study cases (Boca do Rio and Salgados) the main feature of tsunami grains was the 

high value of percussion marks, with no comparable value within their inferred source of sediment. However, 

this feature was not observed in other tsunami and storm deposits (Scotland and Indonesia) where fresh 

surfaces dominated and increased when compared with possible source material. The difference can be 

explained by the presence of an extra sedimentary source (e.g. dunes), which is the case of the Portuguese 

study areas. This fact would increase the sediment concentration and likely would cause more impacts 

between grains although with less kinetic energy involved in the impacts because they would have less 

space to gain velocity before collision. Furthermore, this fact suggests that the sediment concentration 

control the presence/increase of specific microtextural signatures in tsunami and storm grains. The increase 

in the energy involved in deposition of high energy events, when compared with permanent-regime 

sedimentation, tends to be represented in quartz grains as an increase in percussion marks or fresh 

surfaces. Although grains tend to maintain some inherited microtextural characteristics, total resurfacing of 

grains may occur but mainly in areas closer to the coast. 

The origin of percussion marks has been a contentious matter. For instance, Campbell (1963) 

indicated that little evidence can be found to support the thesis that percussion markings on sand-size 

particles can be done in an aqueous environment. On the other hand, Mahaney (2002), Madhavaraju et al. 

(2009) and Deane (2010) suggested that V-shaped patterns of mechanical origin mainly originate in 

subaqueous medium with high-energy conditions. Lindé and Mycielska-Dowgia??o (1980) tested grains (in 

sedimentary environments and experimentally) and noted that there are differences in the occurrence of the 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

180 
 

V-shaped forms found on natural and experimental sand grains, but their similarity nevertheless proves that 

the grains were subjected to mechanical abrasion in aqueous environment. So, it is manifest that although 

the origin of percussion marks is still a matter under discussion it is typically associated with aqueous high 

energy conditions of grain mobilization. 

The approach addopted, both with field and experimental data, suggests that the generation of 

percussion marks is strongly linked with high sediment concentration and transport by grain flow. As 

Bagnold (1962) stated, sediment with a volume concentration greater than 9% would, as a rule, not move in 

suspension and Hsu (2004) suggested that concentrated dispersions of grains tend to move by grain 

collision. Furthermore, Mulder and Alexander (2001) suggested that in sediment mixtures with 40% or more 

sediment-volume concentrations are not physically turbidity currents, as in such high concentrations they are 

no longer supported by fluid turbulence, because grain interactions play the dominant role. Hanes (1986) 

modelled water flow as two fluid regions with continuous stress, velocity and granular concentration 

overlying a stationary bed: a collision-dominated granular fluid region and a wall-bounded turbulent-fluid 

shear region with saltating grains. 

It is argue here that grain interaction, within an aqueous environment with high sediment 

concentration (i.e. typical in tsunami evens - Gelfenbaum et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009, 2010b), is the main 

process responsible for the abundance in percussion marks detected in our dataset. 

In order to answer that question one experiment was conducted using a magnetic stirrer within a 

container with water and sediment. The purpose of the experiment was to test the microtextural implications 

of aqueous transport at different time scales (6 and 60 minutes), different velocities (700 and 1100 magnet 

rotations per minute) and different sediment concentrations (2, 20 and 40%). The proportion of sand and 

glass microspheres (chosen because of their similarity with quartz, economical cost and clean surfaces) 

used was 1/3 of microspheres and 2/3 of beach sand. After each run, microspheres were selected and SEM 

images obtained. Furthermore, the microtextures detected in each microsphere, were counted and were 

later compared with features photographed in pre-experiment (non-used) microspheres (Figure 6.14). 

The results obtained show a higher number of shallow mechanical imprints (e. g. percussion-like 

marks) at the higher sediment concentration (40%) range. In contrast, larger areas of a single sphere were 

affected at the lower concentration regime (2%) and the marks presented high relief, thus suggesting 

stronger impacts. Velocity and time increases translated in intensifications in the frequency of microtextural 

features. 

The experiment proved that a relatively short period of time is enough to imprint significant abrasion 

marks in microspheres, thus strongly suggesting that short-lived events can produce strong imprints in 

quartz grains. However, they do not produce significantly shallow (percussion mark like) impacts. In fact, the 

microtextures produced were fresh surfaces, fractures and abrasion affecting areas of different sizes. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

The laboratory experiments confirmed the data collected and observed in a wide range of 

sedimentary environments establishing that short lived events are capable of imprinting the surface of quartz 

grains and also demonstrating that sediment concentration and velocities of the water flow are conditioning 

factors of type, frequency and incision-depth of microtextural features sculptured in the surface of clastic 

particles.

minutes at 1100 rpm with a sediment concentration of 20%. Red arrow marks fresh surface. C – Microsphere image after 6 
minutes at 1100 rpm with a sediment concentration of 2%. Red arrow marks fresh surface. D - Microsphere image after 60 

minutes at 700 rpm with a sediment concentration of 40%. Red arrows mark percussion marks and white arrow marks long 
abrasion mark. 

 

This experiment suggests that time plays an important role in terms of the frequency of 

microtextural signatures, but the energy-level involved and sediment concentration associated with each 

event are the main factors that control which and how much microtextural imprints are observed in the  

grains. Based in our results we argue that short lived high-energy events of coastal inundation are 

undoubtedly capable of resurfacing, totally or partially, quartz grains sourced in the vicinity of the deposition 

place. 

The experimental results indicate that when entrained in a low-concentration regime, the 

microtextural signatures developing and affecting the particle surface are mainly deep impact features and 

fresh surfaces, while percussion marks are only present in higher concentration regimes (Figure 6.14C and 

6.14D). This suggests that the sediment concentration plays a significant role in the microtextural features 

that are produced during high energy aqueous events. The experimental results suggest that lower sediment 

concentration allows the grains to reach higher velocities upon impact which is put in evidence by the deeper 

imprints in the grains surface in the lower sediment concentration regime. Furthermore, the different 

velocities tested indicate that the main microtextural difference is the frequency of microtextures observed, 

also implying a relationship between velocity of transport and frequency of imprints in the grains surface. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

182 
 

One example that supports the arguments presented is the findings of Wang et al. (1982) that 

analysed grains from turbidites in the Canadian continental margin. The authors concluded that the grains 

maintained their original shape, even if their edges appeared to be slightly rounded, but the microtextural 

features were superimposed by “an abundance of collision-induced marks, particularly mechanical V-forms”. 

Some of the previous SEM studies on tsunami deposits did not focus in quartz but ilmenite grains - 

Babu et al., 2007 and Lakshmi et al., 2010 - and showed that the high intensity of tsunami wave action 

caused severe deformation of ilmenite particles. The comparability of the results presented here with these 

results is constrained by the different minerals (and characteristics) used. Studies that used quartz (Bruzzi 

and Prone, 2000; Costa et al., 2009) presented evidences that high-energy events (in both cases the AD 

1755 tsunami) were essentially characterized by source-inherited features. However, a few features were 

specifically associated with tsunami transport, such as upturned plates, fractures and marks of considerable 

size. 

Nevertheless, the present findings provide further evidence that even though the exact source is 

somewhat difficult to establish with clear-cut precision, that is primarily due to the fact that tsunami waves 

transport grains from a wide range of environments, and they are capable of carving microtextural signatures 

in the grains. A tsunami-transported grain population should thus reflect the sedimentary environments 

crossed by the tsunami waves (when they are close to the coast and capable of eroding, transporting and 

depositing sediments, i.e., within the closure depth of the coastal zone) and the imprints that are marked in 

the surface of grain during that event. The dominance of contemporaneous or pre-event signal depends not 

only on the duration and energy of the event but also on the sediment concentration that controls the inter-

grain collision. 

A model of transport is proposed based in the microtextural features observed (Figure 6.15). In this 

model we suggest that the microtextural signatures observed in the surface of quartz grains are conditioned 

by the transport mechanism involved in each sedimentary environment. Thus, in the nearshore area (below 

depth of closure) the dominant transport mechanism is the oscillatory movement of waves, in the beach 

(submerged and emerged) area the breaking of waves is the transport agent that dominates. On the other 

hand, in the dunes the wind is the transport agent that causes the movement of grains. Furthermore, in the 

alluvial plains the movement of grains is caused by occasional flooding episodes of fluvial origin. These 

mechanisms of transport of grains conditioned decisively the quantity and types of microtextural imprints 

observed in the grains (cf. Figure 6.15A). 

When tsunami waves invade the coastal area, they are capable of eroding, transport and deposit 

large sediment masses. The type of microtextural signatures observed in quartz grains is, in our opinion, 

conditioned by the type of transport and sediment concentration during tsunami run-up. In Figure 6.15B a 

conceptual model is exhibited presenting the geographical areas where it is believed grain flow transport 

dominates (i.e. the slip face of the dune) and were the grains are subject to more percussion marks imprints. 

The suspension and saltation mechanisms also occur but are present during the whole tsunamigenic 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

invasion, while grain flow is constrained to a specific area where gravity and sediment concentration play 

decisive roles. In the study areas where stable dunes are not present, the microtextural signatures to be 

observed should present a complete lack or reduced number of microtextural features associated with grain 

flow (i.e. percussion marks) and a more clear dominance of fresh surfaces (associated with saltation and 

suspension).

6.4. Heavy mineral signature of extreme marine inundations 

The use of heavy minerals to establish provenance of tsunamigenic deposits has been sparsely 

attempted (e.g. Switzer et al., 2005; Bahlburg and Weiss, 2007; Szczucinski et al., 2006; Babu et al., 2007; 

Morton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et al., 2008; Switzer and 

Jones, 2008). Generally, local specificities in the assemblages of geological nature constrain extrapolation of 

inferences between field sites and, so far, the only feature commonly observed in all locations is a higher 

heavy mineral content in the basal part or basal sub-units (when the layer is stratigraphically complex) of 

tsunamigenic deposits and yet, the reason explaining this concentration is still not well understood. 

The results obtained are in agreement with the above. In fact, as demonstrated for the tsunamiites 

and tempestites studied, the sampling region prevails as a grouping factor (Figure 6.16) when the whole of 

the sample set is studied, thus demonstrating a regional conditioning factor as responsible for up to 75% of 

the variance in tsunamigenic and storm deposits assemblages. Hence, samples need to be considered and 

analysed by geographical regions if further discrimination is wanted to be extracted from the samples. 

Otherwise, when analysed overall, the regional character will prevail. 

In the Portuguese studied areas the heavy mineral assemblages are dominated (&gt;90%) by 

andalusite, tourmaline and staurolite. In Lhok Nga, about 90% of the heavy mineral population is composed 

of amphiboles and andalusite. In Scotland, in Voe of Scatsta, heavy minerals are almost exclusively (ca. 

90%) made of amphiboles; whereas in Stoneybridge the assemblage is dominated by amphiboles and 

pyroxenes (&gt;90%). The highest concentration of heavy minerals was detected in tempestites of 

Stoneybridge mainly due to richer source material (i.e. Lewisian gneiss).

Note: left image – IND – tsunami samples Indonesia; P – tsunami samples Portugal; Str_P – storm sample Portugal; Str_HB 

– storm sample Hebrides; SHT – tsunami samples Shetland. 

 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

186 
 

The Indonesian samples presented lower values of heavy mineral content in total sediment fraction 

and no trend was detectable. However, while Lhok Nga’s tsunami samples exhibited a complex stratigraphy, 

other deposits analysed elsewhere were in essence massive. This is reflected in the heavy mineral results 

by the maximum horizontal and vertical variation in the proportion charecterizing each heavy mineral species 

(although without alterations in the assemblage) having been found in Indonesia and attributed to 

preservation of distinct depositional episodes including run-in and backwash and selective density controlled 

transport. By contrast, the Portuguese and Scottish tsunami sediments are more homogenous, reflecting 

preservation of one sedimentation pulse or mixing promoted by multiple waves within a confined 

accommodation space. 

Thus, the results are in accordance with Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) that detected higher heavy-

mineral concentrations at the base of individual sand layers inferred to have been laid down by different 

waves from the same event, and also in line with Morton et al. (2007), who concluded that storm and 

tsunami deposits can contain heavy-mineral laminae at the base and within the deposit because the heavy 

mineral assemblage is source dependent. 

 To facilitate the discussion below, Table 6.3 summarizes the range of specific gravities for the 

minerals observed in the studied areas. It is possible to perceived that staurolite is the densest mineral in the 

Portuguese assemblages, while zircon and garnet were the denser minerals detected in Lhok Nga. In fact, in 

the Lhok Nga’s samples, it was observed that the higher values for zircon and garnet were detected in the 

backwash sample and in the most inland sample, which suggest that the source of those minerals was 

situated farther inland.

Staurolite 3.65-3.75 

Andalusite 3.16-3.20 

Tourmaline 3.00-3.25 

Pyroxene 3.03-3.96 

Amphiboles 2.85-3.60 

Garnet 3.10-4.30 

Zircon 4.60-4.70 

Quartz 2.60-2.70 

 

In the cases of Salgados and Boca do Rio, principal component analysis shows that the first 2 

components explain more than 2/3 of the total variance in heavy mineral assemblages (Figure 6.19 and 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

187 
 

6.22); tsunami samples share fewer similarities with nearshore materials and more resemblances with dune 

and, to a less extent, with beach sediment, thus indicating dune and beach as the more likely sources.  

In Salgados and Boca do Rio, results of heavy mineral studies allowed discriminating tsunami 

sediments from all possible source materials, the former generally showing higher proportions of heavy 

minerals in total sedimentand selective concentration of staurolite (densest heavy mineral identified in the 

assemblage). The discrepancies between the percentages of staurolite in the Portuguese studied areas 

might be related with the more complex stratigraphy of Boca do Rio (cf. Hindson and Andrade, 1999) 

indicating that backwash sedimentation was present and conditioned the results obtained for that location. In 

the studied samples of Boca do Rio, the stratigraphical contrast was not evident but heavy minerals suggest 

that heavy mineral assemblage was probably conditioned by possible backwash. 

 Figure 6.17 presents a ternary plot diagram (andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) with samples 

from Salgados that demonstrates that all present-day analogues, tsunamiites and tempestite samples share 

many similarities in terms of assemblages although with more similarities between dune and tsunami, thus, 

once more suggesting the dune as the more likely (or relevant) sediment source for the tsunami deposit. 

 

 

Figure 6.17 – Ternary plot of staurolite, andalusite and tourmaline assemblages in Salgados. 

 

In agreement with the above, Figure 6.18 demonstrates that tsunami samples from Salgados 

present the highest percentage of heavy minerals and highest percentage of staurolite. These two facts 

combined suggest a higher or selective transport capacity during this tsunami event. 

Sample SG_14_(0.20-0.28), a likely storm deposit, present the highest concentration of staurolite 

(the densest heavy mineral of the assemblage), which might be related to what Mange and Wright (2007)

described about swash on beaches during storms that are typically ideal for carrying away the quartz and 

feldspar, while leaving behind the concentrated heavy minerals. However, the fact that this tempestite 

sample is a single example limits the robustness of the conclusion. 

 

 

Figure 6.18 – Percentage of heavy mineral in total sediment fraction (left image) and percentage of staurolite (right image) 
observed in beach, dune, nearshore, tsunami and storm samples retrieved from Salgados. 

 

Komar and Wang (1984) documented on the Oregon coast the development of small black-sand 

deposits during single storm events, the concentrating processes taking place within the zone of wave 

swash on the beach face. Swash processes are ideal for the development of heavy-mineral concentrates by 

the selective winnowing of low-density quartz and feldspar, the heavy minerals lagging behind. However, 

there is a marked enhancement of swash motions having periods &gt;20 sec, the approximate upper limit of 

wave periods directly attributable to the storm. This long-period swash action, referred to as related with 

infragravity waves, must obtain its energy indirectly from the storm, since it does increase with storm 

intensity and offshore wave height. These long-period swash motions are a major factor in producing erosion 

of the beach face and  the increase in the long-period infragravity swash on beaches during storms is ideal 

for selectively winnowing away lighter minerals and  while leaving behind sediment concentrated in heavy 

minerals; thus, a functional analogy can be established with our results, that detected higher heavy mineral 

concentration in tsunamiites, in association with the inrrush of a long-period wave reworking local sandy 

sediment. 

The waves and currents in the outer portions of beaches are not as conducive to mineral sorting as 

in the swash zone. The breaker zone is characterized by high levels of turbulence, which carry sand in 

suspension, thus having the effect of mixing of the sediments rather than sorting them according to their 

densities. Particles having low settling rates will tend to drift offshore from the breaker zone, and this may 

result in some degree of concentration of heavy minerals on the beach as a whole. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

The model proposed by Kudrass (1987) invoke something of a ‘‘sweeping’’ action of the waves, 

selectively pushing the heavy-minerals landward to concentrate them in the beach sands, depleting their 

concentrations in the offshore shelf sands. Part of this sweeping action may result from the orbital motions of 

the waves acting on the seafloor sand in the offshore, thus again in agreement with the results presented 

here that indicate lower heavy mineral concentrations in the nearshore samples. 

In samples where it was possible to conduct vertical analysis of variation in the percentage of heavy 

minerals in total sediment, the results disagree with Morton et al. (2008), who identified an overall upward 

increase in heavy mineral laminations at some locations. In fact, samples from Salgados, Voe of Scatsta and 

Stoneybridge present a clear pattern of decreasing the percentage of heavy minerals upwards in the high-

energy sediment unit, thus suggesting a decrease in energy associated with the event(s) responsible for 

their deposition and this is in total agreement with textural data. 

In what concerns horizontal patterns, it was not possible to establish a clear variation in Boca do 

Rio, whereas in Salgados a very slight decrease inland was identified. 

In Boca do Rio, dune and beach are the more likely sources for the tsunamigenic deposit as 

illustrated in Figure 6.20 and 6.21. In the ternary plot diagram (andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) all 

samples exhibit compositional similarities although nearshore samples slightly differ from all others. This and 

the results displayed in Figure 6.21 – showing strong similarities between dune and tsunami samples and 

prominent contrast with nearshore samples – clearly point to the establishment of dune as the most relevant 

sedimentary source of the tsunamigenic unit. Furthermore, the same pattern is highlighted in the principal 

component analysis (Figure 6.22) that, once more, demonstrates the grouping of tsunami, beach and dune 

samples and the differentiation from nearshore samples. 

In fact, this result (dune as the main source of tsunamigenic sediment) is in agreement with 

inferences taken from the historical record (Silva Lopes, 1841) and geomorphological analysis (Oliveira et 

al., 2009) in Boca do Rio, where the erosion of the dunes by the AD 1755 tsunami and textural relations 

between aeolian and tsunami sediment in this location are further discussed. 

Actually, Bahlburg and Spiske (2011) in their study of the sedimentary record of the February 2010 

tsunami at Isla Mocha (Chile), observed that the tsunamigenic unit was produced essentially (i.e. &gt;90%) by 

the backflow. These authors suggest that due to the lack of sedimentary structures, many previous studies 

of modern tsunami sediments assumed that most of the detritus were deposited during inflow and an 

uncritical use of this assumption may lead to erroneous interpretations of palaeotsunami magnitudes and 

sedimentary processes, if unknowingly applied to backflow deposits. It is hypothesized by this work, that this 

statement may apply to part of the previous studies focusing the AD 1755 deposit at Boca do Rio. Results 

obtained in this study suggest that in some locations of that lowland a signal from the backwash has been 

preserved and is still detectable in the heavy mineral assemblage of the tsunami sediment layer.

This results strongly suggest that tsunami samples in Salgados and Boca do Rio were mainly 

sourced in dune material and to a lesser extent to beach samples. However, in Boca do Rio, backwash

192 
 

signal is present in the heavy mineral assemblages due to lower content in staurolite and proportion of “other 

minerals” (suggesting seaward sediment input). 

The comparison of our results with the data reported by Jagodzinski et al. (2009) - which also tried 

to compare tsunami deposits, beach sediments and pre-tsunami soils in Thailand – is limited by the 

constrains associated with regional variance. While Jagodzinski et al. (2009) detected differences in the 

proportions of mica and tourmaline and attributed those differences to the mode of sediment transport and 

deposition (with mica, due to its low density, being more abundant in the topmost part of the tsunami 

deposit) on the assemblages studied in Salgados, Boca do Rio, Voe of Scatsta and Lhok Nga it was 

possible to associate variations in staurolite (Salgados and Boca do Rio) and in zircon and garnet 

(backwash Lhok Nga) – the denser minerals of the respective assemblages - to tsunamiites and those 

variations are attributed to likely source and run-in and backwash interchange. 

In Stoneybridge, the pattern that emerged was a robust decrease upward in terms of the heavy 

mineral percentage in total sediment, which is in agreement with the description by Mange and Wright 

(2007) for storm heavy mineral concentration. The assemblage remains stable although with minor and 

irregular percentage variations in garnet, pyroxenes and amphiboles, which are insufficient for 

interpretations beyond inter-sample disparities.

6.5. Sedimentary environments and sedimentological 

differentiation 

The differentiation between sedimentary environments using proxies other than ecological has 

been attempted many times in the past and no worldwide criteria have been undisputedly accepted. Based 

in the cases studied in Portugal and in agreement with the data obtained in this study, it was possible to 

establish specific criteria to differentiate a number of sedimentary environments (Table 6.4). However, 

limitations on the number of representative samples and locations should be considered, this summary 

beying a first approach that should be tested elsewhere. 

It was concluded that alluvial samples tend to be more heterometric and poorly sorted when 

compared with dune and beach samples. Alluvial samples also presented a richer heavy mineral 

assemblage in terms of “other minerals” indicating a different (inland) relevant source. 

On the other hand, grains of beach sediment are more angular and present more abundant fresh 

surfaces (both in the morphoscopic and microtextural analyses). By contrast, dune sediment yielded more 

rounded and spherical particles and present more adhering particles than beach samples. 

Mason and Folk (1958) were able to distinguish beach, dune and aeolian flat sediments by size 

analysis (using standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness of the grain size distributions). In their study case, 

dune and beach presented the lower and higher standard deviation, respectively, and these sedimentary 

environments were not distinguishable using kurtosis and skewness. The same authors also concluded that 

there is a very high inter-location variation in size distribution parameters, that variation constraining some of 

the conclusions. In the presented studied cases, textural analysis, by itself, did not allow a clear 

differentiation of sedimentary environments. 

These results are partly in agreement with Shepard and Young (1961) (74 locations worldwide) that 

demonstrated that dune sands are generally rounder, have a larger silt content and higher content in heavy 

minerals. If dune sands are more rounded than beach samples because of the abrasion between grains 

produced during wind transportation, very little rounding would have occurred in transporting sand to the 

bordering dunes. That being the case it would be necessary to collect samples at considerable distances 

inland, within the dune field, in order to get appreciable differences. If, on the other hand, the principal 

difference comes from the sorting action of the wind in picking up rounder grains from the beach, the 

difference should be immediate. Beal and Shepard (1956) showed that there was no progressive change 

with distance inland. 

Shepard and Young (1961) concluded that a greater degree of roundness in dune samples in 

almost all cases studied. 80% of sand grains in beach berms are more rounded than in the foreshore, either 

by action of wind or action of waves. They determined increasing roundness for beach, berm and dune. 

These contrasting results reflect the high specific character of each group of samples, which should be 

reflected in caution when analysing the results from these proxies. In the field areas addressed in this study, 

dune grains, in agreement with Shepard and Young (1961), were more rounded inland and the berm 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

194 
 

presented more angular particles. An increasing inland profile/trend in roundness was just about discernible 

in Salgados and in Boca do Rio the oldest dune (known as Roman dune, due to roman ruins that it covers) 

presented higher values for roundness and dissolution, thus suggesting longer periods subjected to 

mechanical and/or chemical processes, hence indicating an older age. 

 According to the obtained results, nearshore samples should be divided in two groups: proximal 

and distal nearshore samples. The first group (situated between the closure depth and the surf zone) shares 

many similarities with beach samples and, in the case of Boca do Rio grains from the latter were more 

angular than from the former. Distal nearshore samples (situated beyond the closure depth) presented 

typically higher percentage of bioclasts, rounded grains with strong and abundant dissolution features and 

the higher values for adhering particles. In fact, Samsuddin (1986) discussed a marked variation in size 

distribution in the foreshore and breaker zone that occurs due to a variation in wave energy reaching the 

point of sampling and extent of turbulence affecting this environment. The plunge point just seaward of the 

backwash is considered as the point of maximum turbulence and high energy conditions. This zone is of 

primary importance in forming the final sediment pattern in the beach environment. We argue that this 

plunge point correspond to the higher values for angularity and fresh surfaces that were observed in our 

grains. Our conclusions are supported by Iversen (1951) that demonstrated that the internal motion of 

breaking waves is a highly turbulent flow condition that is capable of keeping large amounts of particles in 

suspension, which might justify an increase in collision between grains with consequent increase of 

angularity, mechanical marks and fresh surfaces. 

 From the proxies tested in the present research it was able to apply morphoscopy, microtextural 

analysis and heavy mineral assemblages as tools for sedimentary environment differentiation, although 

caution should be used in the extrapolation of these results elsewhere.

6.6. Single event signatures: the spatial contrast 

The tsunami deposits of AD 1755 that accumulated along the Algarve coastline mostly consist of a 

laterally extensive layer of shell-rich sand displaying an erosive base and a gradual and irregular upper 

boundary, which ramps and thins landwards. In some locations, the tsunami deposit is entirely composed of 

sand (e.g. Salgados). In other areas, the tsunami deposits are characterized by sand sheets containing 

isolated (also referred to as “floating”) cobbles (e.g. Boca do Rio). 

The Lagoa dos Salgados is actively accreting and this coastal depositional environment exhibits 

significant potential as a sedimentary archive of palaeoenvironmental changes that occurred throughout the 

Holocene. In this case, the data described above suggests that the lagoonal infill accumulated essentially 

after 7000 Cal BP, in progressively lower-energy conditions, favoured by sheltering offered by the presence 

of a coastal barrier. Sediments of units A to C exhibit a neater marine signature when compared with the 

topmost deposits of units D and F, which correspond to terrestrial-sourced, mud-dominated sedimentation 

that persisted throughout the last ca. 1500 years across the whole lowland. This later sedimentation pattern 

was disrupted by a unique event responsible for the deposition of unit E, a single laterally continuous and 

thin laminae of coarser material carrying abundant marine ecological proxies, which suggests a brief return 

to higher-energy conditions and marine sourced sedimentation, affecting most of the lowland. Although the 

Lagoa dos Salgados is subject to occasional breaching of the barrier promoted by marine overwash, 

providing water and sediment exchange with the ocean, the textural signature of these events is, at present, 

as it was in the recent past, confined to the inlet and flood shoals, where marine sand reaches the top of the 

stratigraphic column. Further inland and at a short lateral distance from the channel, the top sedimentary unit 

is solely represented by mud of unit F. 

Within the upper mud-dominated units D and F (global thickness of 0.70-1.90 m) the conspicuous 

medium sand lamina (unit E) occurs at ca. 0.40 m below the surface and consists essentially of quartz sand 

with marine bivalve shell fragments and mud intraclasts (rip-up clasts). The thickness of this layer decreases 

from ca. 0.80 m close to the barrier to a few mm ca. 850 m at its landward limit, well beyond normal 

overwash, storm and tidal influence. 

The sandy tsunami layer in Boca do Rio consisted of several distinct sub-units that vary greatly in 

both vertical and horizontal sections. This unit is in contrast with the mud-dominated sedimentation of 

terrestrial source observed in the under and overlying units. The highly variable nature of the horizon 

appears to be due to rapid variation in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the depositional event (run-in, 

backwash and periods mediating both processes where mud could settle) and diversity in source materials. 

The tsunami deposit detectable at ca. 0.80 m below the surface wedges out and becomes discontinuous, 

but it can be traced for more than 1 km inland. 

Mapping of the laminae in Salgados suggests a wide, thin and fan-shaped feature, wedging out 

within the lagoonal basin, implying an exceptionally large inundation of marine origin. The erosive base 

together with the presence of rip-up clasts and grain size contrast with the framing sediment favours an 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

196 
 

emplacement mechanism governed by an abrupt single high-energy marine inundation, rather than a 

positive increment in the sea level rise rate. 

The spatial distribution of characteristics of sediment from unit E and the inferred vectorial properties 

of flow and associated sediment dispersion path are compatible with a massive inflow of marine water and 

sediment. This is in clear contrast with the outflow that must have followed the inundation and apparently 

failed to leave a distinct sedimentary record. Moreover, the sedimentary signature of the inundation 

demonstrates that the inflow path of water and sediment was essentially conveyed through the inlet rather 

than extensive overtopping of the barrier, thus providing an objective limit to the maximum elevation of the 

water level at the time of inundation. In the case of Boca do Rio, according to coeval sources (Pereira de 

Sousa, 1919), the tsunami waves overtopped the existing foredune. 11-13 m for the elevation of tsunami 

waves at the coast are mentioned, as well as the destruction of the large foredune by the incoming waves. A 

detailed description of the effects of the backwash was also made, referring to the uncovering of Roman 

ruins in the beach area. Since AD 1755, the coastal system has not been capable of rebuilding a robust 

foredune. 

The comparison of the textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and heavy mineral assemblage of unit E 

from Salgados sediments and of possible sources, suggest that the coarser fraction of unit E was mainly 

derived from beach and dune sediments, whereas the underlying unit D may have contributed to the finer 

fractions. The beach comes out as a very likely source in terms of angularity and fresh surfaces of the 

grains, whereas dunes are suggested as a major source by percussion marks and heavy mineral 

assemblages. Most probably both environments have contributed as primary and essential sources for 

materials washed inland and deposited as unit E. This is in line with Sato et al. (1995), who found that two 

Japanese tsunami deposits (1983 and 1993) were mainly sourced from the beach sediments, using limited 

textural data. 

As suggested by Goff et al. (1998; 2001) the shell richness is one of the attributes characterizing 

tsunami sediments, and a good marker of the high-energy involved in the sediment transport. In Lagoa dos 

Salgados, unit E is characterized by a sharp increase in the carbonate content associated with shells, mostly 

represented by fragments of thick-shelled marine bivalves. In Boca do Rio, within the tsunamigenic unit, the 

nannoplankton, foraminifera and ostracoda assemblages are diverse, containing a variety of predominantly 

marine species (Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, 1999), which is in contrast with the 

assemblages observed for the under and overlying units, which were dominated by a small number of 

species that were able to tolerate the variable salinity conditions typical of estuarine and salt marsh 

environments. 

The heavy mineral assemblage in places sampled at Boca do Rio might suggest incorporation of 

material from backwash, although the massive facet of the deposit constrained the clear identification of sub-

units that could reinforce that conclusion. In the studied cases of Salgados and Boca do Rio, differences in 

heavy mineral assemblages of tsunamiites allows speculation about the relevance of the backwash 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

197 
 

sedimentary contribution. In the case of Boca do Rio it may have been larger and probably fuelled by the 

geomorphological setting – enclosed valley. In contrast, the wide flat area of Salgados lagoon apparently 

dismissed any relevant contribution of backwash deposition, which was not perceived in any of the proxies 

used. The influence of contrasting geomorphology of the accommodation space offered by both lowlands in 

what regards sedimentary signatures left  by the same flooding episode is further illustrated by Hindson and 

Andrade (1999) detailed stratigraphic analysis of the trenches excavated in Boca do Rio; they found a 

complex stratigraphy and interpreted that complexity as indicative of  more than one episode of 

sedimentation being represented within the tsunamigenic unit, at least in the more seaward portion of the 

lowland. Further inland, they remarked that the deposit was texturally more consistent, and transformed into 

a single homogeneous sand layer, indicating that the processes of deposition were simpler. This is in clear 

contrast with Salgados, where a more spatially consistent deposit (i.e. single sandy layer) was observed, 

suggesting that the depositional story preserved in the sedimentary archive is proportionally simpler. 

The likely source for the tsunami deposit is Boca do Rio has been discussed by other authors 

(Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade 1999 and Oliveira et al., 2009) and all implied the dune as the 

main sedimentary contributor for the tsunamiite. Our morphoscopic, textural, microtextural and heavy 

mineral results are in agreement with this, especially by demonstrating that nearshore was the unlikeliest 

source and implying the dune as the main source (if not the only) relevant source. The backwash signal is 

relevant, at least in some locations, and should deserve consideration in future studies. 

Immediately to the east of Salgados, in the Alcantarilha lowland, Dinis et al. (2010) observed 

geomorphological features extending inland from the lee slope of the coastal dune ridge associated with the 

deposition of a thining inland sandy layer that extended in the adjacent alluvial plain, and interpreted these 

features as the result of a tsunami event;  due to its chronostratigraphic characteristics it can be correlated 

with the same event responsible for the deposition of unit E in Lagoa dos Salgados (i.e. the AD 1755 

tsunami). 

Similarly, in Martinhal (immediately to the east of Sagres), the AD 1755 tsunami breached the 

barrier and deposited an extensive sheet of sand. The tsunami origin for this deposit was supported by 

several features, such as incorporation  of rip-up clasts from the underlying layer, basal erosive contact and 

contrast between increased content of marine Foraminifera in the tsunamigenic unit and the essentially 

brackish assemblages yielded by the under and over lying layers (Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007). 

In other areas of the Algarve sedimentary evidences of the AD 1755 deposits were also discussed 

by Andrade (1990, 1992) in Ria Formosa, central Algarve; and Costa et al. (2011) in Barranco and Furnas 

(east of Martinhal). In the case of Ria Formosa severe damage of the barrier chain and extensive overwash 

of two of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira) was detected. 

In the Barranco and Furnas alluvial plains a group of uncommon size-range particles [0.3 - 1m (a-axis 

diameter)] were observed a few hundred meters inland. The radiocarbon dates obtained from in situ 

endolithic bivalve shells suggested that transport was contemporary with the AD 1755 tsunami. 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

198 
 

Although the documentary record indicates that the Algarve coast has been affected by other 

tsunamis in the last two millennia (Baptista and Miranda, 2009), no clear sedimentary record of their activity 

has been found, until present. If the time window is extended further back, a single reference to a peculiar 

layer, inferred as tsunamigenic and dated from ca. 6th century BC, was described by Schneider et al. (2009) 

in a central Algarve lowland. 

The lack of correspondence between historical and sedimentary record of tsunami events in the 

Late Holocene can be attributed to: a) eventual predominance of erosional patterns, as discussed by 

Szczucinski (2011) in the case of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, thus inhibiting the preservation and 

deposition of tsunamigenic signature; b) lack of textural contrast hindering distinction between tsunami and 

framing sediments; c) tsunami waves incapable of overtopping dunes, thus limiting their sedimentary 

signature further inland of the coastline; d) extensive seaward shift in the location of the land-sea interface 

promoted by the forced regression that accompanied intensive silting of formerly drowned lowlands. 

This study shows that the sedimentary signature recognized in unit E from Lagoa dos Salgados 

shares many stratigraphic and chronological characteristics with the nearby deposits detected in Boca do 

Rio (and elsewhere in the Algarve), thus suggesting a regional and synchronous event as responsible for its 

deposition. This conclusion is in agreement with the documentary record of this particular inundation in the 

Algarve coast. The spatial characteristics of the tsunami layer at Lagoa dos Salgados suggests that the 

barrier was effective in preventing extensive overtopping by the waves and this provides grounds to infer the 

maximum elevation of the sea surface in this coastal stretch of ca. 10m at the time of inundation. 

A similar pattern was observed in Boca do Rio. The pre-existing dune was washed away by the AD 1755 

tsunami waves (Silva Lopes, 1841). Based in historical records (Silva Lopes, 1841), archaeological data  

and GIS-assisted geomorphological reconstructions (Oliveira et al., 2009) the estimated elevation of that 

dune is compatible with values obtained for Salgados (ca. 10m), thus indicating a similar tsunami wave 

height at the coast between the two locations (separated by approximately 50 km). 

The uniqueness of this record within the top low-energy sedimentary sequence lasting for about 

1500 years in Lagoa dos Salgados, Alcantarilha, Boca do Rio and elsewhere in Algarve lowlands might be 

used, with caution, to extrapolate a recurrence interval for similar high magnitude tsunami-borne inundations 

of this coast, suggesting that such interval may be of millennial scale.

6.7. Multiple event signatures 

The deposits studied here share many of the sedimentological diagnostic criteria of tsunamiites and 

a summary is presented in Table 6.4. 

The Salgados tsunamigenic unit is composed of medium to fine sand, contrasting markedly with the 

underlying sediment and is separated from it by an unconformity. The tsunamiite in Salgados presents a 

decreasing thickness inland up to its oblivion approximately 800 m from the present day coastline. This unit 

presents a strong lateral variance in terms of its sedimentary characteristics although it is commonly 

observed as a massive sandy deposit with no identifiable laminations and without sedimentary structures.  

Numerous mud rip-up clasts from the underlying unit were found in this unit. 

In Boca do Rio the studied tsunamiite studied is present in the alluvial plain Holocene sequence, up 

to ca.1200 m from the coastline. The thickness of this unit also decreases inland. The study of this deposit 

revealed a strong lateral variation and a complex sedimentological characterization. In some locations it was 

possible to differentiate sub-units within this unit, mainly in the seaward area. However, the sub-units 

disappear inland and the deposit becomes a massive-like deposit before its wedging out inland. The lower 

contact of this unit is erosive and it also showed very abundant broken shells of marine organisms, rip-up 

clasts and, in some locations, cobbles and boulders. 

The tsunami sediments associated with the Storegga slide consist of fine or medium sand, often 

containing rip-up clasts both of organic material or peat. They basal contact is erosive and the unit has a 

massive-like appearance even if cobbles could be observed within the unit. 

In Lhok Nga the tsunamiite is composed of greyish to yellowish coarser to medium sand, with 

relevant variations in thickness, grain-size and vertical trends. The contact between the tsunamigenic units 

and the underlying soil is abrupt or erosional. The thickness of the tsunami deposits varied and reached its 

maximum values in the topographic lows. Lamination was visible and corresponded to distinct layers 

associated with the sequence of run-in and backwash phases of successive tsunami waves. 

The fact that different size-ranges were observed within the tsunamigenic unit might suggest that 

the sediment material was transported through a combination of rolling, saltation and suspension. 

Age-estimation calculations allowed the association of the deposits observed in Salgados, Boca do 

Rio and Voe of Scatsta with specific events that affected the Portuguese and Scottish coasts (AD 1755 

Lisbon tsunami and the Storegga Slide). The Lhok Nga deposit was associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean 

tsunami. 

Common aspects to the occurrences briefly characterized above include an erosional/sharp basal 

contact, thinning inland, fining upwards, the presence of rip-up clasts and a higher concentration of heavy 

minerals (decreasing upward) when compared with source material. These characteristics reflect the 

suddenness of a unique high-energy marine inundation responsible for the deposition of the studied units. 

One further pattern common to all deposits studied is that they may show contrasts in sediment texture, 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

200 
 

vertical size-grading, thickness of the deposit, neatness of boundaries with over and underlying units, 

presence of transitional grading to the overlying sediments and other macroscopic features (e.g. alignment 

of prolate mud clasts, platy shell fragments  or whole valves embedded in sand, number of rip-up clasts at a 

certain distance from the basal contact, “floating” bouders or cobbles) in observation points located at very 

short distances. This is more apparent in deposits showing more complex lithostratigraphic arrangements, 

which, in turn, may reflect, to some extent, entrapment of the inundation in semi-enclosed spaces, a feature 

determined by geomorphological constrains. 

 Although sedimentological similarities between the different studied deposits were salient, several 

differences were noted. Only the deposit of Lhok Nga presented stratification/laminations distinctly 

separating depositional entities, which were associated with the different waves and backwash. The other 

deposits essentially revealed a massive aspect, which is probably associated with either depositional 

specificity associated with turbulent flow or with the lack of conservation of the sedimentary structures, as 

reported to have been observed within a 5-year interval following the 2004 tsunami – see above. Related 

with this is the presence of mud-drapes in the unit studied in Lhok Nga and their absence in the deposits of 

Salgados, Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta. The deposition and preservation of mud drapes on sand waves 

is favoured by a large sand-wave asymmetry, a high bottom concentration of suspended mud and large 

time-velocity asymmetry (Allen, 1982) conditions that were likely registered in Lhok Nga but apparently did 

not prevail in the other locations studied. 

 Broken shells (of both macro and microscopic organisms) are a common presence in tsunami 

deposits. In our studied cases, the tsunamiites revealed a significant occurrence of broken shells within the 

units analysed and attributed to tsunamis. However, in the Voe of Scatsta samples macroscopically it was 

not possible to observe the presence of shells within the deposit. 

 In terms of grain size distribution all the massive-like deposits presented a unimodal distribution, 

while the Lhok Nga samples presented a bimodal distribution, thus representing a substancial difference in 

terms of source origin. In the case of Salgados, Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta the unimodal distribution is 

simply explained by the similar grain-size characteristics of the possible source materials. 

 Morphoscopic and microtextural imprints were discussed in detail in section 6.2.and 6.3. Some 

local specifies constrain extrapolations of the results, although they demonstrated the relevance of these 

techniques in the differentiation of tsunamigenic units and in the establishment of their likely sedimentary 

sources. 

 All tsunamiites studied revealed an increase in the percentage of heavy minerals and a decreasing 

upwards concentration of denser minerals. 

 The establishment of source was possible for Salgados and Boca do Rio where it was clear that the 

tsunamigenic sediments share less similarities with both alluvial and nearshore materials and more 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

201 
 

(morphoscopic, microtextural and heavy mineral assemblages) similarities with dune and beach deposits, 

thus suggesting the latter as the probable sedimentary source of the tsunamigenic units.

6.8. Storm vs tsunami deposits 

To compare tsunami and storm deposits it would be preferable to compare events and their 

sedimentological signatures in the same location. However, due to sedimentary and sampling constrains this  

was only possible in the case of Salgados, even though only one storm sample was studied in detail, it 

constrains interpretations and precludes extrapolations. Though the limitations above, comparison was 

possible between the Stoneybridge storm samples and the tsunamiites of Salgados, Boca do Rio, Voe of 

Scatsta and Lhok Nga (Table 6.5). Furthermore, the Salgados storm deposit was compared with the 

tsunamiite and present-day analogues retrieved from the same location. 

Both tsunami and storm deposits can appear to be massive, lacking sedimentary structures, but 

most storm deposits exhibit at least some sub-horizontal planar stratification (Schwartz, 1975; Morton 1978; 

Leatherman and Williams, 1983; Tuttle et al., 2004). Where present, the number of layers or lamina sets in 

both tsunami and storm deposits depend partly on the thickness of the deposit. Both deposits studied at 

Salgados did not present lamination or differentiation in layers, thus revealing a more massive-like structure. 

In the case of Stoneybridge and their comparison with tsunamiites, it was noted the absence of rip-up clasts 

and of broken shells in the former case, which was attributed to local characteristics. Another differentiator 

factor was the presence of more angular and less spherical grains which could be ascribed to either 

characteristics of source sediment or to the energy and timing involved in the storm event. The latter 

assumption is valid if we consider that the rounding of grains is a process that requires longer time to be 

completed (in comparison with sharpening of edges – as previously discussed in section 6.2). Another factor 

that allowed differentiation between storm and tsunami deposits was the distinct inland penetration in 

Salgados. The storm deposit is registered at shorter distances from the coast while the tsunami imprint 

extends for almost 1 km inland. It is quite plausible that the inland penetration distance of the 

sedimentological signatures of a large tsunami exceeds that of a storm when the same location (i.e. same 

morphological constrains) and similar time windows (thus excluding significant changes in the above-

mentioned constrains) are considered. It is however questionable if this contrast in dimension is a universal 

criterium for distinction of storms and tsunami deposits. 

At Stoneybridge the vertical variation of the storm deposit was observed with the presence of more 

bioclasts at top and base of the deposit (fact explained by the proximity with under and overlying layers). In 

fact, more lithic material was observed in the middle section of this deposit, which reflects more clearly the 

high-energetic character of the event and the sediment source. Moreover the grains revealed more angular 

features and fresh surfaces, which is clearly related with the more energy involved and the possible higher 

sediment concentration. However, it is important to stress that the base of the unit presented low angularity 

values, possibly the result of long term action on the initially available sediment. The fact that percussions 

marks were present in a reduced percentage is most likely related with source characteristics. 

The tempestite grains in the Stoneybridge deposit were mostly sub-discoid and spherical grains 

were nearly absent and the percentage of heavy minerals decreases to top, which is a common aspect of 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations 

 

204 
 

storm deposits (Mange and Wright, 2007). Moreover, it was also observed a decrease in the percentage of 

“other (heavy) minerals” towards the top which might reflect the decreasing capacity of transportation or, 

more probably, the selective transport of heavy minerals (which was discussed in section 6.4). 

In Salgados the fact that only one possible tempestite sample was used in this study limits some 

analysis and interpretations. Results obtained in this case show that the tempestite presented lowest 

percentage of bioclasts compared with both the tsunami and possible source materials. Hence, the storm 

deposit present the highest percentage (ca. 80%) of quartz, followed by tsunami (75%-55%) and present-

day analogues (&lt;60%). The tempestite in Salgados shared many similarities with beach samples, such as 

the lower percentage of well-rounded grains and high content in discoid grains, although it presented similar 

values to tsunami grains in terms of angularity and percussion marks. The storm deposit in Salgados 

presented high percentage of heavy minerals (higher than possible sources but lower than tsunami 

samples), a maximum value for staurolite (densest mineral of the assemblage) - which was followed by the 

rest of tsunami samples. Furthermore, it also presented the lowest value for tourmaline (similarly to tsunami 

samples). These heavy mineral features are indicative of similarities between the two events (i.e. storm and 

tsunami) even though tsunamis seem to present a higher concentration of heavy minerals probably due to 

their higher transport energy (i.e. higher turbulence of the flow).

7. Conclusions 

 

7.1. Achievements and future work 

Numerous studies of sediments recording extreme marine inundations have aimed to characterize 

and distinguish such sedimentary materials, thus contributing to extend the available database on coastal 

inundation further back in time, well beyond the historical record, and also estimate event recurrence. This 

work further contributed to these objectives by focusing on the application of textural, morphoscopic, 

microtextural and compositional analysis and features, to identify deposits of extreme marine inundations 

and their likely source materials. The work presented here results from a variety of locations (Salgados and 

Boca do Rio - Portugal; Lhok Nga – Indonesia; Voe of Scatsta and Stoneybridge - Scotland) and considers 

events of different chronologies and sources (AD 1755, 26 December 2004 and the Storegga Slide 

tsunamis; the Great Storm of 11 January 2005) that affected contrasting coastal settings with different 

regional oceanographic conditions. 

The methods used on samples from the studied sites were: lithostratigraphic interpretation, grain-

size analysis and interpretation of size-distribution patterns; morphoscopic characterization of selected 

particle populations under the microscope; microtextural characterization of quartz grains using Scanning 

Electron Microscope imagery and study of heavy mineral assemblages. 

The storm and tsunami deposits studied consisted of essentially sand-sized sediment. The typical 

lithostatigraphic setting of these peculiar deposits is of one high-energy layer or laminae sandwiched within 

low-energy sediment, presenting an abrupt basal contact, thinning and fining inland until wedging out within 

the low-energy materials, which correspond to the signature of the permanent sedimentation regime. 

Tsunami deposits typically exhibited a noticeable lateral variation in all sedimentary and geometric features, 

even at short distances, and all presented a massive internal structure, with the exception of the most recent 

event (2004 tsunami and deposit in Lhok Nga – Indonesia). 

Results obtained from the morphoscopic study of sand-sized particles (e.g. roundness and shape) 

indicate that in Salgados (Portugal), Boca do Rio (Portugal) and Lhok Nga, these attributes are useful in 

discriminating coastal sedimentary environments and/or in the establishment of likely source material for 

materials deposited by extreme marine inundations. For instance, in Salgados it was clear both through the 

compositional pattern, as well as considering sphericity, that the nearshore samples share the less affinity 

with the tsunamiite samples. 

Results from grain surface microtextural analysis revealed that this proxy is a valuable 

complementary sedimentological technique to be applied in the discrimination of coastal sedimentary

environments and is relevant in the identification of extreme marine inundation deposits, especially when 

considered within the regional sedimentological and geomorphological context. Tsunami- and storm-

transported grains presented a more frequent surface reworking by percussion marks and fresh surfaces 

when compared with potential source materials and with grains representing present-day active coastal 

depositional environments. Heavy mineral assemblages were typically site-specific. Generally, the 

concentration of heavy minerals in total sediment decreases up-unit in the high-energy layer and, in one of 

the studied sites (Salgados, southern Portugal) the content in heavy minerals (e.g. staurolite) presented 

qualitative and quantitative similarities with dune samples. In that case, it was also possible to use heavy 

mineral assemblages to differentiate tsunami and storm deposits. In Lhok Nga (Indonesia) and Boca do Rio 

(Portugal) it was also possible to identify a mineralogical signature specific of the tsunami backwash. 

The recognition of the same sedimentary signature of the AD 1755 tsunamigenic event, in several 

lowlands of the Algarve coast of Portugal and its integration in the sedimentary history preserved in its long-

term sedimentary archive provides grounds to suggest a millennial-scale time for the return period of this 

type of events, with similar intensity, in this region. However, constrains on our present-day ability to pick 

and identify all the geological evidences of extreme marine inundations in the sedimentary record (e.g. 

associated with preservation of deposit, existence of lithological and textural contrasts, etc.) need to be 

further addressed to establish return periods more confidently. Similarities between deposits studied in 

Salgados and Boca do Rio were compiled and facilitated interpretations at a regional scale. Differentiation 

between tsunami and storm deposits was evidenced by the incorporation of rip-up clasts in tsunamigenic 

deposits while they were absent in the storm deposits analysed. Furthermore, the dimensions and strong 

lateral variation in features of tsunamigenic units was in strong contrast with the smaller size and more 

consistent spatial distribution of sedimentary features within storm-deposited sedimentary units. 

Overall results revealed that site-specific effects precluded clear-cut extrapolations on a storm vs 

tsunami emplacement mechanism of worldwide application, although they demonstrated that the use of 

multiple proxies, such as textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and compositional, data, enhances the 

possibility of using sedimentological criteria to recognize and differentiate tsunami from storm deposits and, 

in both cases, determine source-deposits relations, if the regional context is sufficiently constrained. 

 The initial goals established for this thesis were achieved: 

a) Coastal sediments deposited by Holocene extreme marine inundations were identified, 

described, characterized, dated and related with single high-energy events of abrupt marine inundation; 

b) Sediment exposures and samples were analysed using a multidisciplinary and multi-proxy 

approach that included characterization and interpretation of lithostratigraphic, geometric, dimensional, 

textural, microtextural and compositional features of the sediment, addressed at contrasting spatial scales 

(ranging from the scale of the outcrop or sedimentary column to the ultramicroscopic imagery of single 

particles) to achieve an interpretation  of processes controlling the entrainment, transport and deposition of 

terrigenous sediment during high-energy single events of coastal flooding;

207 
 

c) Textural and microtextural analysis was applied in order to establish the source material or/and 

to identify specific signatures of extreme marine inundations in coastal sediments; 

d) The value of heavy mineral assemblages in coastal sediments in establishing source materials 

or/and in building compositional signatures specific of extreme marine inundations was tested with 

encouraging results; 

e) Return periods for extreme marine inundations (i.e. tsunamis) were conjectured for the Algarve 

coast of Portugal; 

f) Overall, this thesis contributed to the development of the current knowledge on criteria used to 

characterize sediments deposited by high-energy events of coastal flooding, such as tsunamis and storms, 

and to increase our ability to distinguish deposits related with each type of oceanographic forcing. This is 

especially true in what regards the study of factors controlling microtextural features imprinted in the surface 

of quartz grains and the value of those features in reconstructing the nature and energy-level of the transport 

agent. 

 

The work presented in this thesis, although contributing to the enhancement of sedimentological 

criteria presently available to recognize and differentiate extreme marine inundation deposits, revealed areas 

where additional research should be conducted in order to better understand the complex processes 

involved in extreme marine inundations and how they translate into the sediment. In fact, additional and 

more detailed provenance studies should be conducted with the purpose of establishing tsunami- and storm-

deposit sedimentary sources and, through this, improve understanding on the physical and sedimentary 

mechanisms of extreme marine inundations. For instance, the backwash process and its influence in the 

arrangement of tsunamigenic units, is at the present state of knowledge, scarcely understood. To conduct 

these studies the widespread use of microtextural and heavy mineral analysis on samples obtained from 

both observed and fossil deposits is recommended; revisiting classic reference locations and deposits, such 

as the ones of Boca do Rio (Portugal) or Voe of Scatsta (Scotland), re-sampling and re-interpreting these 

“classical” deposits incorporating the developments achieved on backwash signatures learned from the 

Sumatra and Japan events may result in significant advances in the comprehension of the geological record. 

Furthermore, the increase in the number of research sites will facilitate generalization of conclusions and 

perception on which proxies or features may be used independently of regional to local specificities; thus 

diminishing the influence of site-specific constrains that normally (at the present state of knowledge) 

modulate inferences obtained from the study of extreme marine inundations departing from the geological 

archive. These approaches will provide more tools and data to comprehend depositional and erosional 

processes involved in tsunami and storm sediment flow and transport. 

In some cases, where tsunami or storms present significant sedimentary erosive patterns (volume 

of sediment remobilized exceeding the total volume of the sediment unit inland) it would be challenging and 



Sedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations

innovative to focus on the sediment deposited at the nearshore area, beyond the closure depth, where some 

of these deposits are most probably immobilized and in a state of “non-equilibrium” with the prevailing 

oceanographic conditions; if that section of the inner shelf is accreting, the potential of a short core 

containing record of multiple events is high. 

In this study no major differences between tsunami deposits caused by different origins (i.e 

earthquake and landslide) were detected. However, further studies should address this issue with the 

ambitious aim of increasing our ability to distinguish sedimentary columns containing multiple events 

generated by the same source (even if separated in space) from sections containing signatures of multiple-

source events, both cases being of different significance in geodynamic and hazard terms. Furthermore, the 

relationship between distant and local tsunami origins will most probably (at least, at a regional scale) be 

reflected in the tsunami deposit. The application and development of more accurate age-estimation 

techniques (direct or indirect) will also facilitate the establishment of return periods of extreme marine 

inundations with obvious positive consequences for the study and assessment of hazard/risk for any specific 

coastal area. It is essential that future research contributes to the increase of the accuracy of the 

sedimentological criteria to recognize and differentiate sedimentary products laid down by extreme marine 

inundations.

Annex 2 – Atlas of quartz grains 

With the samples collected, and after laboratory treatment, a group of SEM photos of the quartz 

grains was gathered (Table A2.1). A group of microtextures visible in the surface of the quartz grains was 

identified and an atlas was compiled to facilitate the identification of microtextures. The grains were analysed 

and the microtextures were classified according with the area of the surface of the grain that they occupied.
