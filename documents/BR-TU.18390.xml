resumo 
 

 

A conversão de ambientes naturais em terrenos agrícolas tem efeitos 
profundos na composição da paisagem, frequentemente resultando em 
mosaicos de campos de cultivo, pastagens e restantes fragmentos de 
vegetação natural. Pensa-se que um aumento na complexidade estrutural de 
um mosaico de habitats pode favorecer a disponibilidade de nichos ecológicos 
para os animais, potencialmente aumentando a diversidade de espécies. Os 
morcegos são muito móveis, e muitas espécies requerem o uso de diferentes 
habitats de forma a cumprir as suas necessidades diárias e sazonais. No 
entanto, a sua distribuição ao longo de uma paisagem pode refletir uma 
resposta à estrutura da mesma, e às dinâmicas de distribuição espacial e 
temporal dos recursos, assim como refletir as preferências de alguns habitats 
em detrimento de outros, determinadas pelas características eco-morfológicas 
da espécie. Desta forma, a seleção de habitat por parte dos morcegos é uma 
resposta conjunta a características locais e de paisagem. Neste estudo foram 
investigados os padrões espaciais e sazonais de atividade e diversidade de 
morcegos numa paisagem heterogénea em Portugal, constituída por um 
mosaico de habitats naturais, semi-naturais e alterados pelo Homem, tanto em 
ambientes terrestres, como sob a influência de água-doce ou salobra. Além 
disso, foram investigadas quais as características da paisagem que 
determinam esses padrões, ao longo de quatro escalas focais distintas. A 
amostragem de morcegos foi feita acusticamente, enquanto em simultâneo se 
amostraram insetos usando armadilhas de luz, em 24 pontos representativos 
dos principais tipos de habitat que caracterizam a paisagem. Foi descoberto 
que as assemblages de morcegos dos diferentes habitats eram relativamente 
semelhantes entre si, e que a atividade de morcegos praticamente não diferia 
entre habitats. No entanto, verificou-se a existência de uma forte variação 
sazonal dos níveis de atividade de morcegos nos vários habitats. Além do 
mais, os resultados obtidos revelaram que a resposta dada pelos morcegos às 
características locais e de paisagem é dependente da escala e da guild. De 
uma forma geral, os resultados obtidos sugerem que os morcegos exploram 
todos os habitats que constituem esta paisagem heterogénea, e que o mosaico 
de habitats lhes fornece diversas oportunidades, o que resulta em fortes 
dinâmicas espaciais e sazonais. Por outro lado, foi descoberto que estas 
dinâmicas são influenciadas por características da paisagem a uma larga 
escala, assim como por condições meteorológicas, e pela disponibilidade e 
distribuição locais de recursos. Por último, os resultados indicam que as zonas 
florestais e o Bocage são potencialmente os habitats mais importantes para os 
morcegos nesta paisagem heterogénea.

abstract 

 
The conversion of natural environments into agricultural land has profound 
effects on the composition of the landscape, often resulting in  a mosaic of crop 
fields, pastures and remnant patches of natural vegetation. It is thought that an 
increase in structural complexity of a habitat mosaic may improve the 
availability of ecological niches for animals, potentially increasing species 
diversity. Bats are highly vagile, and many species require the use of distinct 
habitats to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs. However, their distribution 
throughout a landscape may reflect a response to landscape structure and 
spatial and seasonal dynamics of resource distribution, as well as preferences 
for some habitats relative to others, determined  by species eco-morphological 
traits. Therefore, the way bats select a habitat is an aggregative response to 
both landscape and local features. We investigated the spatial and seasonal 
patterns of bat diversity and activity within a heterogeneous landscape in 
Portugal, constituted by a mosaic of natural, semi-natural and human-altered 
terrestrial, freshwater and brackish habitats. Furthermore, we investigated 
which landscape features determine those patterns, across four distinct focal 
scales. We sampled bats acoustically, while simultaneously sampling insects 
with light traps, across 24 sampling sites representative of the main habitat 
types that shape the landscape. We found bat assemblages of the different 
habitats to be relatively similar, and that bat activity hardly differed among 
them. However, we found seasonal variation in bat activity within habitats. 
Additionally, our results revealed both scale- and guild-dependent responses of 
bats to landscape and local features. Overall, our results suggest that bats 
exploit all habitats of this heterogeneous area, and that the mosaic landscape 
provides them several opportunities, which results in strong seasonal and 
spatial dynamics. On the other hand, we found these dynamics to be influenced  
by broad-scale landscape features, as well as by weather conditions, and local 
resource availability and distribution. Lastly, our results indicate that forest and 
Bocage habitats are potential keystone structures for bats within this 
heterogeneous landscape.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 BAT DIVERSITY 

 

Bats, Chiroptera, are the second mammalian order in terms of number of species (ca. 

1300), only surpassed by rodents (ca. 2300, Wilson and Reeder, 2005). The ability to fly 

actively and to echolocate, the long life-span, the long viability of the sperm cells, and the 

diversity of ecological niches conquered, are some of the traits that distinguish bats from 

the other mammalian orders (Dietz et al., 2009). The dietary habits of bats range from 

animalivory (arthropods, small vertebrates and blood) to herbivory (nectar and pollen, 

fruits and leaves) (Patterson et al., 2003), and they occur throughout the world with the 

exception of the Arctic, Antarctica and some oceanic islands (Findley, 1993; Saitia, 2007). 

Bats’ dietary richness, allied to the high diversity of niches they occupy provide valuable 

ecosystem services, supporting and maintaining the ecological integrity of natural and 

human-altered landscapes, as primary, secondary or tertiary consumers (Kunz et al., 

2011). Some of the main ecosystem services provided by bats are seed dispersal 

(Muscarella and Fleming, 2007), pollination (Tschapka et al., 1999), and insect 

suppression (Cleveland et al., 2006; Kalka et al., 2008). All European bat species feed 

mainly on insects and other arthropods (Dietz et al., 2009). The suppression of arthropod 

populations is therefore the main ecosystem service that European bat species provide, 

resulting in the reduction of agricultural pests and leaf damage, as well as in the control of 

vectors of pathogens of human and other mammals (Kunz et al., 2011). 

In mainland Portugal occur at least 25 bat species (ICNB, 2012), belonging to four distinct 

families (Miniopteridae, Molossidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae, Figure 1.1), 

many of which are threatened or still remain strongly unknown (Cabral et al., 2005). All 

species feed mostly or exclusively on arthropods, but they have developed distinct hunting 

strategies, while also selecting foraging habitats and prey differently. Some of these 

species are “aerial-hawkers”, which capture their prey during flight, while others capture 

their prey from substrates (“gleaners”) or from water surfaces (“trawlers”) (Jones and 

Rydell, 2003). Furthermore, some species actively search for prey while flying, while 

others have adopted a “sit-and-wait” strategy, detecting and hunting arthropods that fly 

past (“flycatchers”) or move on the ground (“perch-hunters”) (Jones and Rydell, 2003).

INTRODUCTION

1.2 IMPORTANCE OF WETLANDS FOR BATS 

 

Wetlands are productive ecosystems that provide several resources important for human 

populations (Finlayson, 1999). Over centuries, humans have made various 

transformations in these environments, resulting from agriculture and urbanization (López-

Merino et al., 2011). The increasing human population, and the consecutive growth in 

resource demands (e.g. food and space), has been one of the main causes for the loss 

and/or degradation of wetland ecosystems (Aber et al., 2012). The loss of wetlands due to 

intensive agriculture, mainly through drainage, besides reducing drastically the area of 

these relatively rare ecosystems, often results in the eutrophication of the remaining 

wetland areas, and in their invasion by pest (exotic or autochthonous) plant species 

(Zedler and Kercher, 2005). As these wetland areas are lost, so are the ecosystem 

services they provide, and the support of the rich biodiversity they frequently harbour 

(Finlayson, 1999; Zedler and Kercher, 2005). 

Wetlands (Menzel et al., 2005; Lookingbill et al., 2010), as riparian habitats in general 

(Walsh and Harris, 1996; Grindal et al., 1999; Rainho, 2007) are recognized as important 

foraging habitats for bats, particularly in agriculture-based landscapes (Sirami et al., 

2013), where natural remnants may be scarce. Furthermore, they may also act as 

commuting routes (Grindal et al., 1999; Fukui et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2006), enhancing 

landscape connectivity. Menzel et al. (2005) found that bat activity was higher in restored 

wetlands rather than in reference wetlands and forested areas, suggesting that wetland 

restoration may have immediate effects on bat populations. Similarly, Grindal et al. (1999) 

found higher levels of bat activity and greater capture rates in riparian habitats than in 

forests, along an elevation gradient, and Sirami et al. (2013) reported a significant 

influence of wetland size and water cover on bat activity within an agricultural matrix. This 

positive influence is often interpreted as a result of prey availability in these habitats. In 

fact, Fukui et al. (2006) found that bat activity in a riparian forest was correlated with 

insect abundance. These habitats may also be important to maintain bat populations in 

anthropogenic disturbed areas, such as production forests. The results obtained by Lloyd 

et al. (2006) suggest exactly that, since activity levels and bat diversity were similar 

among managed and unmanaged forests, within riparian buffers. However, Rainho (2007) 

found that water sites located within intensively managed habitats (agriculture and 

forestry), provide poor foraging areas. Lastly, Lookingbill et al. (2010) found that an 

increase in wetland network connectivity enhanced the positive association between bat 

activity and these environments.

1.3 BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES 

 

There are several threats to bat populations worldwide, resulting directly or indirectly from 

human activities (Racey and Entwistle, 2003). Amongst them, habitat loss through 

transformation or degradation, and habitat fragmentation are probably the major threats to 

bat diversity as a whole (Primack, 2000; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). One of the main 

reasons for such alterations is the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural 

landscapes. Indeed, the majority of the European territory is nowadays occupied by 

farmlands (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002, Billeter et al., 2008), and there are hardly any 

landscapes free of any type of human influence (Meeus, 1995). The conversion of natural 

environments into agricultural landscapes is often carried out at the expense of native 

biodiversity (Mickleburgh et al., 2002; Tscharntke, et al., 2005), and result in the 

immersion of remnant natural patches in a human-managed, agricultural matrix (Uematsu 

et al., 2010; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013). These landscapes are usually 

characterized by high spatial heterogeneity, forming mosaics of crop fields and pastures, 

and remnant natural patches (Duchamp and Swihart, 2008). Moreover, agricultural 

landscapes are not stable, rapidly changing along with human activities (Di Giulio et al, 

2001; DeClerck et al., 2010; Gilroy et al., 2010). Despite the known negative effects of 

agriculture intensification on biodiversity (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002; Tillman et al., 

2002; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Cerezo et al., 2011), low-intensive land-use systems 

can actually contribute towards its conservation (Tscharntke et al., 2005). 

It is thought that an increase in structural complexity of a habitat mosaic may result in 

greater species diversity, due to the availability of more ecological niches, and to the 

promotion of several distinct opportunities for resource exploitation. This is known as the 

“habitat heterogeneity hypothesis” (Pianka, 1966; Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., 2004). 

Within a mosaic-shaped landscape, resource availability may be spatially heterogeneous, 

thus its suitability to an organism may change across different regions of the landscape 

(Milne et al., 1989). Consequently, spatial heterogeneity may affect the dispersal patterns 

of organisms, as well as their foraging behaviour (Johnson et al., 1992), since the required 

resources may be unevenly distributed throughout the landscape patches, and the ability 

of an organism to exploit them may depend on the landscape connectivity. Therefore, the 

response given by an organism to spatial heterogeneity depends strongly on its taxonomic 

group, its dispersion abilities, and its perception of the surrounding habitat (Kotliar and 

Wiens, 1990; Malanson and Cramer, 1999; Tews et al., 2004). For instance, bat species 

differ in their mobility and, consequently, on their home-ranges. Therefore, the perception 



INTRODUCTION

of the landscape of a bat which has low mobility and a small home-range, such as P. 

pygmaeus (Nicholls and Racey, 2006), will differ completely from one of a bat with high 

mobility, such as T. teniotis, which is able to fly up to 30 km between the roost and a 

foraging site (Marques et al., 2004). 

Although some bat species seem to have strict associations with certain habitat types, 

many are generalist in their use of the distinct available habitats, and often depend on 

multiple settings to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs especially to deal with different 

requirements along the various stages of their life-cycle (Law and Dickman, 1998; 

Lookingbill et al., 2010). Since bats are highly vagile, they can exploit the resources 

provided by different patches within a landscape characterized by a mosaic of habitats, 

and thus become less dependent on particular land cover types (Fenton 1997). 

Furthermore, habitat mosaics may favour the conditions necessary to the co-occurrence 

of different species, by allowing them to exploit different habitats (Law and Dickman 

1998), and to exhibit distinct patterns of resource exploitation, even when they are 

morphologically similar (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Davidson-

Watts et al. 2006).  

 

 

1.4  INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE FEATURES ON BATS 

 

The interaction between bats and the features of the landscape they inhabit has been the 

focus of several recent studies (e.g. Gorresen et al., 2005; Yates and Muzika, 2006; Perry 

et al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009), including some that were 

developed in agricultural landscapes in temperate regions (e.g. Duchamp and Swihart, 

2008; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 

2011, 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013).  

To focus on the relationship between bats and heterogeneous landscapes, it is important 

to establish some definitions associated to landscape features (which will also be used 

during the following chapters of this study). Dunning et al. (1992) grouped the various 

measures of landscape structure into two general categories: 

i) Landscape physiognomy, “refers to features associated with the physical layout of 

elements within the landscape”; and 



CHAPTER 1 

 
8 

ii) Landscape composition, refers to “the relative amounts of each habitat type 

contained within the landscape” and “include metrics that measure the presence, 

absence, or relative proportions of landscape components”. 

Another important definition made by Dunning et al. (1992) was: 

iii) Landscape complementation, the process that occurs when distinct patch types 

hold different resources both required by an organism, and they occur in close proximity 

within a landscape. Therefore, this landscape is able to “support a larger population than 

do landscapes in which these habitats are far apart”. 

The majority of studies that investigated interactions between bats and landscape features 

revealed species- or guild-dependent responses to landscape features (e.g. Klingbeil and 

Willig, 2009; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013), as well as 

different responses at different spatial scales (e.g. Gorresen et al., 2005; Perry et al., 

2008). Nevertheless, in agricultural-based landscapes, a positive influence of forest cover 

seems to be a recurrent result (e.g. Duchamp and Swihart; 2008; Fuentes-Montemayor et 

al., 2011). Within a heterogeneous matrix dominated by agricultural lands, interspersed 

with remnant forest patches, Ethier and Fahrig (2011) found a positive influence of 

fragmentation on bat abundance, and showed that landscape complementation is the 

main mechanism supporting that relationship. On the contrary, the results obtained by 

Popa-Lisseanu et al. (2009) showed a negative influence of habitat fragmentation on the 

populations of Nyctalus lasiopterus. The authors justified this negative effect as a result of 

the large distances between adequate roosting and foraging habitats, which can be 

interpreted as low landscape complementation, following the definition provided by 

Dunning et al. (1992).  

The abovementioned studies have already provided some knowledge on the interaction 

between bats and landscape features in heterogeneous environments. However, there 

are still important gaps concerning the patterns of bat occurrence within those landscapes 

and of the processes behind them.

1.5 OBJECTIVES 

 

The Baixo Vouga Lagunar, located in the Central-North Portuguese coast, is an area 

characterized by a human-altered heterogeneous landscape, composed by a complex 

matrix of natural, semi-natural and human-made habitats. In close contact with an 

estuarine coastal lagoon, this region detains unique features, and is regarded as holder of 

a rich biodiversity. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of 

vertebrate distribution, particularly regarding bats. 

We hypothesise that: 

1.  Bat assemblages structure and composition varies among the habitat types 

occurring in the area;   

2. Species differing in morphology and hunting strategies vary in their habitat 

preferences within the region;  

3. The activity levels of the co-occurring bat species are limited by seasonality;  

4. Bat activity and richness are explained by both landscape and local features within 

the study area;   

5. The response given by bat activity to landscape characteristics varies across a 

gradient of focal scales; and  

6. Different bat guilds respond differently to landscape and local features.  

With this study, we expect to obtained important knowledge on several aspects of bat 

ecology, leading to a better understanding about the interaction between these animals 

and the heterogeneous landscape of BVL. Hopefully, the knowledge acquired with this 

study will be interpreted as a solid base for future research, conservation plans and land 

management decisions, and help in the interpretation of the relationship between bats and 

human-altered, heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere. 

 

 

1.6 FRAMEWORK 

 

The present study is included in a broader project named “Factors that affect the seasonal 

and spatial patterns of vertebrate diversity and activity in different habitat types of the 

humanized landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar”, developed by a team of MSc students, 



CHAPTER 1

under the scientific orientation of PhD and Postdoctoral researchers of the Wildlife 

Research Unit, Department of Biology, Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, 

University of Aveiro (Figure 1.2). This project arises from the need to understand the 

spatial and seasonal patterns of the distribution of species that occur in the humanized 

landscape of BVL, as well as to determine which are the factors influencing them. 

This region, holder of a great biological diversity, is characterized by a mosaic landscape, 

with aquatic and terrestrial environments, and a great habitat diversity, largely shaped by 

the secular human action (Brito et al., 2010). However, knowledge about the dynamics of 

the animal populations, assemblages and communities that occur in the region is still very 

scarce.

INTRODUCTION 

 
11 

This project intends to bridge this gap in the scientific knowledge, by investigating a 

patterns and processes of diversity and abundance of a wide variety of vertebrate and 

invertebrate taxa, belonging to several trophic levels, namely insects, amphibians, small 

non-volant mammals, bats, carnivores and birds. 

The scheduling of the several fieldwork components, relative to the different studied 

taxonomic groups, took into account an optimization effort regarding human, material and 

financial resources, through the mutual help of the team members. 

The main objectives of the project, transversal to all the studies are: 

1) To detect spatial patterns of diversity within the mosaic of habitats of the region; 

2) To assess the existence of seasonal patterns in the occupation of the different 

habitats, by the various taxa under study; 

3) To identify the main factors behind those patterns, relating species presence with 

biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic variables; 

Based on the scientific knowledge already acquired and to be acquired in the future, and 

by the means of ecological modelling approaches, the elaboration of maps of priority 

conservation and management areas is also intended. This will allow the proposal of very 

specific management actions. 

This project will be used as groundwork for future ecological research in the BVL area by 

the Wildlife Research Unit team, as well as to a more sustainable exploration and 

management of its natural resources, by giving continuity to established partnerships (e.g. 

Municipality of Estarreja) and searching for new ones with the local stakeholders.  

Three other MSc theses resulted from this project. The specific goals and main results 

obtained in each one are as follows: 

 

“Factors affecting the diversity of amphibians in Baixo Vouga Lagunar” 

Globally, the main objectives of this study, developed by Inês Torres, were to understand 

which factors determine the distribution and diversity of amphibians within the 

heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar. The sampling of amphibians was 

done in three replicates of seven habitat types representative of the study area: Bocage, 

rice fields, maize fields, marshland, reed beds, sea rushes and forest. Several 

methodologies were applied simultaneously, and in a standardised way. Additionally, prey 

abundance was assessed by using light traps to sample insects. 12 different species of 



CHAPTER 1 

 
12 

amphibians were identified, corresponding to approximately 70% of the species occurring 

in Portugal. Preliminary results indicate that prey availability is one of the most important 

factors behind the community composition of these animals. Furthermore, the distance to 

wells was found to be the best predictor for amphibians richness, underlining the 

importance of those structures within an agriculture-dominated landscape such as Baixo 

Vouga Lagunar. 

 

“Foraging and spatial ecology of Marsh harrier in Baixo Vouga Lagunar” 

The study of the bird of prey Circus aeruginosus, developed by Michelle Alves, aimed to 

investigate the species preferences of habitats and prey, as well as the factors that 

determine its occurrence and abundance. Sampling was conducted through direct 

observation of the individuals, in fixed points within the study area, in a daily sampling 

throughout an annual cycle. Regurgitations and prey remaining were collected, so the diet 

of the species could be assessed. The results obtained revealed a diverse diet that 

included small mammals, birds, reptiles, insects and eggs. However, a clear preference 

and selection towards Microtus sp. was found. Besides prey availability, natural habitats 

such as reed beds and marshlands were found to be positively associated with species 

presence and abundance. within the Baixo Vouga Lagunar landscape. 

 

“Mammal choices in the heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar” 

The study of the terrestrial non-volant mammals, developed by Sara Marques, addresses 

the predator-prey interaction, being use several different methodologies for the 

investigation of small mammals and carnivores. The inventory of the small mammals 

community in the BVL, and the analysis of its spatial and temporal distribution across the 

different sampled habitat types, representative of the study area (rice field, Bocage, reed 

bed, forest, sea rush, maize field and marshland) was based on the capture-mark-

recapture methodology, involving the use of Sherman traps. An analysis of the spatial 

distribution of mammals over the whole area was done, taking in consideration the habitat 

type. For that, two non-invasive methods were used: sign surveys and camera-trapping 

(using Bushnell
TM

 Trophy XLT cameras with motion sensor). The main results obtained 

revealed a negative influence of exotic forests on terrestrial mammals, and positive 

associations between small mammals and wetland habitats, and between carnivore 

richness and freshwater courses (i.e. riparian habitats). Lastly, heterogeneity seemed to 



INTRODUCTION 

 
13 

positively influence small mammal fauna at the landscape-scale, and together with 

fragmentation, to negatively influence carnivore richness. Riparian habitats can therefore 

be regarded as some of the most important habitats for terrestrial mammals within the 

heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar.   

 

1.7 THESIS STRUCTURE 

 

This thesis is organized in five main chapters. In the first chapter we present a general 

introduction, as well as the framework of this study and its main objectives. In the second 

chapter we provide a description of the study area. In the following chapters we present 

the main research questions and findings. These are presented in two distinct scientific 

papers. The first entitled “A mosaic of opportunities? Spatio-temporal patterns of bat 

diversity and activity in a strongly humanized Mediterranean wetland” (chapter 3), focuses 

objectives 1 to 3, and the second entitled “Bat richness and activity in heterogeneous 

landscapes: guild-specific and scale-dependent?” (chapter 4) focuses objectives 4 to 6.  

The main findings of this study are provided in chapter five, as well as some general 

conclusions, implications for bat conservation, and suggestions for future research. Lastly, 

the literature cited is provided in chapter 6.

2. STUDY AREA 

 

2.1 LOCATION 

 

The study area is located in the Aveiro district (40º39-52’N, 8º27-45’W), on the Central-

North Portuguese coast. In order to complete the objectives in this study, two different 

study area sizes were defined. For the objectives proposed on chapter 3, we defined a 

study area of approximately 15,000 ha, considerably smaller than the one defined for 

chapter 4, of approximately 50,000 ha. This difference is due to the landscape analysis 

performed on chapter 4, which increased greatly the proportion of the landscape to be 

analysed. At the wider perspective, it involves the municipalities of Albergaria-a-Velha, 

Aveiro, Estarreja, Ílhavo, Murtosa, Oliveira de Azeméis and Ovar (Figure 2.1). The study 

area encompasses a subregion known as Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL), as well as its 

surroundings. However, for simplifying purposes, the study area will be hereafter referred 

simply as BVL.

2.2 CHARACTERIZATION 

 

The BVL subregion harbours a rich biodiversity (Brito et al., 2010). Furthermore, a great 

proportion of the study area is classified as a special protection area (SPA) of the Ria de 

Aveiro coastal lagoon (Figure 2.1), under the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC). 

The landscape is characterized by a heterogeneous landscape, with a mosaic of natural, 

semi-natural and human-altered habitats, including aquatic and terrestrial environments 

(Figure 2.2). As a coastal wetland, it presents several characteristic habitats such as 

marshlands, low-lying lands functioning as a transition between saltwater and terrestrial 

habitats, mainly dominated by Spartina maritima, Salicornia ramosissima, Sarcocornia

perennis and Halimione portucaloides; sea rushes, also a transition habitat between 

aquatic and terrestrial environments, characterized by large extensions of Juncus 

maritimus; and reed beds, wetlands where the influence of saline water is limited, 

characterized by large extensions of Phragmites australis. This region is strongly 

humanized, and agricultural land occupies a great proportion of the landscape (Table 2.1). 

The most frequent crops are those of maize (Zea mays), which are temporary crop fields, 

managed somehow intensively, which are distributed throughout almost all of the 

landscape. Distributed in a much more restricted way, and occupying only a small 

proportion of the landscape, are the rice fields. These are temporarily flooded crop fields 

dedicated to the culture of Oryza sativa. A traditional form of agriculture is also present, 

the Bocage. This unique man-made habitat, is characterized by small areas of crops and 

pastures, intersected by small freshwater courses and live fences of autochthonous trees 

(e.g. Alnus glutinosa, Salix atrocinerea, Quercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. 

Hedera spp., Rubus spp.). In Portugal, this type of agricultural practice is limited to the 

BVL region, and otherwise in Europe only to southern France and northern England (Brito 

et al., 2010). Woodlands within the BVL landscape are fragmented, and mostly composed 

by production, non-deciduous tree species, mainly by the exotic Eucalyptus globulus, but 

also Pinus pinaster. Several localities, mostly villages, as well as numerous industries can 

also be found both within and in the outskirts of BVL.

2.3 CLIMATE 

 

The BVL region is a transition zone between Atlantic and Mediterranean climates, with a 

strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean (Costa et al., 1998; Bonmati et al., 2006). During 

the study period (October 2011 – September 2012), mean air temperature was 14.5 ºC 

(oscillating between 8.5 ºC in February and 19.8 ºC in September), and mean annual 

humidity of 76.5% (data from CUF weather station). Accumulated precipitation varied 

between 5.6 mm in July and 194 mm in November, with an annual value of 627.6 mm 

(data from CESAMET).

3.1. ABSTRACT 

 

We investigated the spatial and seasonal patterns of bat diversity and activity in the 

heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar, Portugal. We acoustically sampled 

bats across 24 sampling sites representative of the six main habitat types that shape the 

landscape. We compared bat diversity, evenness and richness across habitat types and 

seasons, and analysed the spatial and seasonal patterns of overall bat activity, as well as 

of individual species and guilds. From the total of 1544 bat passes recorded, we identified 

twelve different species. Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus 

serotinus/Eptesicus isabellinus stood out as the most frequently recorded. We found bat 

assemblages of the different habitats to be relatively similar, and that bat activity hardly 

differed between the habitats studied. However, we found seasonal differences in bat 

activity within habitats. Overall, our results indicate that bats exploit all habitats of this 

heterogeneous area, and that the mosaic landscape provides them several opportunities, 

which results in strong seasonal and spatial dynamics.

3.2 INTRODUCTION 

 

Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly those that reduce, fragment and transform 

natural habitats, constitute some of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide (Primack, 

2000; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). However, human-dominated landscapes harbour 

much of the world’s biodiversity (Dixon, 2012), and have been the main focus of several 

studies in recent years (e.g. Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2008; Miller et 

al., 2009).  

Due to the growing demands of a rapidly increasing human population, several natural 

ecosystems have been converted to agricultural landscapes (Robinson and Sutherland, 

2002; Kunz et al., 2011), often at the expense of biodiversity (Mickleburgh et al., 2002; 

Uematsu et al., 2010). These landscapes are usually characterized by high spatial 

heterogeneity; forming mosaics of crop fields, pastures and remnant natural patches 

(Duchamp and Swihart, 2008). Furthermore, agricultural landscapes are not stable, since 

they change rapidly in concert with human activities (Di Giulio et al., 2001; DeClerck et al., 

2010; Gilroy et al., 2010). The intensification of farming (Wickramasinghe et al., 2003), 

along with loss of landscape elements such as hedgerows and boundaries (Tscharntke et 

al., 2005; Mehr et al., 2011), increasing use of pesticides (Canova and Fasola, 1991; 

Jones et al., 2009), and land abandonment (Rainho et al., 2010), are known to be some of 

the main threats to several animal groups that occur in these strongly human-dominated 

landscapes.  

Despite the growing efforts towards the conservation of foraging habitats of threatened 

species within agricultural landscapes in Europe (Rainho and Palmeirim, 2011), 

multidisciplinary approaches combining land owners, researchers and law makers are still 

needed to create adequate conservation and management plans for these areas 

(Pimentel et al., 1992; Ornerod et al., 2003). Knowledge about the responses of fauna and 

flora to habitat transformation is therefore a key issue in the conservation of species that 

occur within heterogeneous landscapes (Uematsu et al., 2010; López-Arévalo et al., 

2011). However, understanding and predicting the mechanisms behind those responses 

still present a major challenge for biologists (Bernard and Fenton, 2007). 

Bats form an incredibly diverse group both taxonomically (with about 1300 species 

presently described, Kunz et al., 2011) and ecologically, with several distinct life-histories, 

behavioural patterns and feeding and roosting habits (Patterson et al., 2003; Simmons 

and Conway, 2003). The dietary richness of bats (as primary, secondary or tertiary 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 
27 

consumers) makes them extremely valuable to ecosystems, as they play a key role in 

supporting both natural and human-dominated landscapes (Lumsden and Bennett, 2005; 

Muscarella and Fleming, 2007; Kunz et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2012). All European bat 

species feed mainly on insects and other arthropods (Dietz et al., 2009). Therefore, the 

main ecosystem service that European bat species provide is the suppression of 

arthropod populations, resulting in the reduction of agricultural pests and leaf damage, as 

well as in the control of vectors of pathogens of humans and other mammals (Kunz et al. , 

2011). Furthermore, bats are also very good bioindicators and are used for assessing 

habitat quality, as well as for interpreting the effects of human-induced changes on 

ecosystems (Wicramasinghe et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2009; but see Cunto and Bernard, 

2012). Indeed, the rapid ecosystem changes caused by humans, such as fragmentation 

or destruction of roosting and foraging habitats, have been linked to the decline and 

isolation of bat populations all over the world (Jones et al., 2003; Akasaka et al., 2009). 

In spite of being relatively stable within a given landscape, species composition varies 

amongst the several habitat types that shape that landscape (Moreno and Halffter, 2001; 

Ramos Pereira et al., 2009; Avila-Cabadilla et al., 2012). These differences in species 

distribution may reflect a preference for some habitats relative to others according to a 

species sorting patch dynamics model (see Leibold et al., 2004; Cottenie, 2005; Holyoak 

et al., 2005 for reviews of patch dynamics models). 

Therefore, knowledge about habitat use by bats, including foraging and roosting habitats, 

should be one of the main foundations on which conservation and land management 

decisions are made (Stebbings, 1988; Walsh and Harris, 1996).  

Bats seem to select habitats on the basis of a series of hierarchical decisions, both at 

landscape and local scales (Ford et al., 2006). At landscape scale, bat habitat use is 

mainly dictated by day-roost availability, proximity to winter hibernacula and foraging sites, 

presence of water sources, climate conditions and human-induced disturbances 

(Furlonger et al., 1987; Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003; Evelyn et al., 2004; Ford et al., 2006; 

Johnson et al., 2008, Rainho et al., 2010), while at the local scale, site selection is often 

influenced by proximity to riparian habitats, vegetation structure, morphological and 

echolocation characteristics, and prey preferences (Aldridge and Rautenbach, 1987; Ford 

et al., 2005, 2006; Johnson et al., 2008). Thus, habitat selection is a species-specific 

process, often reflecting species’ morphological characters, as well as their foraging 

strategies and echolocation call structures (Kalko and Schnitzler, 1993; Lundy and 

Montgomery, 2010). While some species are generalist users of habitats, others seem to 



CHAPTER 3 

 
28 

have strict associations with specific habitat types. Together with their ecological diversity 

and flexibility, the high mobility of bats (enabled by their ability to fly rather long distances 

at relatively low energetic costs) often makes their species-habitat associations difficult to 

assess. This seems to be particularly true when the landscape matrix is characterized by 

a mosaic of habitats, allowing bats to explore different sites and to become less 

dependent on a particular setting (Fenton, 1997). However, habitat mosaics may favour 

the conditions necessary to allow co-occurring species to feed in different habitats (Law 

and Dickman, 1998), and to exhibit distinct patterns of resource exploitation, even when 

they are morphologically similar (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, 

Davidson-Watts et al., 2006). Therefore, the analysis of these spatial patterns of co-

existing species may provide important information about the mechanisms of resource 

selection and partitioning between species (Aguiar and Marinho-Filho, 2004). 

The activity of insectivorous bats in temperate regions is strongly limited by the cold winter 

temperatures and the consequent food shortages (Kapfer and Aron, 2007). Furthermore, 

bat flight and foraging activity often reveal daily and seasonal variations, reflecting 

changes in insect availability (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003) and weather conditions, which 

can directly or indirectly influence bat activity (Meyer et al., 2004).  

In this study, we aim to investigate seasonal and spatial patterns of bat diversity and 

activity in the Baixo Vouga Lagunar area, Central-West Portugal. Here, the landscape is 

characterized by a matrix of natural wetland formations (from fresh to brackish water), 

interspersed by intensive and extensive agricultural fields, pastures and production 

forests. Specifically, our objectives are: 1) to identify and characterize the bat 

assemblages of the main habitat types occurring in the area; 2) to assess how different 

species differing in morphology and hunting strategies vary in their habitat preferences 

within the region, and 3)  to examine the seasonal activity patterns of the co-occurring bat 

species.

Study Area 

 

The study area (Figure 3.1) is located in the Aveiro district (40º39-50’N, 8º30-42’W) on the 

northern Portuguese coast. It has an area of approximately 15,000 ha and encompasses 

a region known as Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL). Hereafter, we refer to our study area as 

BVL, although it also encompasses the surrounding areas of that region. It is limited to the 

South by the Vouga River estuary and to the West by an estuarine coastal lagoon, Ria de 

Aveiro. The landscape reflects an ecotone between water- and land-based habitats, 

harbouring several characteristic habitats such as marshlands, reed beds and sea rushes. 

The region is strongly humanized, with many agricultural fields, forest monocultures and 

urbanizations. Eight different types of habitat were distinguished within the study area: 

 

I. Bocage: this unique habitat is characterized by small areas of crops and pastures, 

surrounded by live fences of autochthonous trees (e.g. Alnus glutinosa, Salix atrocinerea, 

Quercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. Hedera spp., Rubus spp.) and small 

freshwater courses. The distribution of Bocage in Portugal is limited to the BVL region 

and, besides this area, it only occurs in southern France and northern England (Brito et 

al., 2010); 

II. Forest: includes woodland patches mainly of Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus 

pinaster monocultures; 

III. Maize fields: these are temporary crop fields mainly dominated by maize (Zea 

mays) cultures; 

IV. Marshland: low-lying lands functioning as a transition between saltwater and 

terrestrial habitats. The vegetation is mainly dominated by Spartina maritima, Salicornia 

ramosissima, Sarcocornia perennis and Halimione portucaloides; 

V. Reed beds: these are wetlands where the influence of saline water is limited, 

characterized by large extensions of Phragmites australis; 

VI. Rice fields: these are temporarily flooded crop fields dedicated to rice culture 

(Oryza sp.); 

VII. Sea rushes: transition habitat between aquatic and land habitats, characterized by 

large extensions of Juncus maritimus; 

VIII. Urban: human settlements, with artificial lighting and asphalt roads.

The area is characterized by a temperate climate with a strong Atlantic influence, with 

well-defined seasonal variation both in air temperature (registered mean annual 

temperature of 14.5 ºC, with an amplitude between 8.5 ºC in February and 19.8 ºC in 

September), and rainfall (registered annual precipitation of 627.6 mm, varying between 

5.6 mm in July and 194 mm in November). BVL is also characterized by high humidity 

throughout the year (mean annual humidity of 76.5%) (air temperature and humidity data 

from CUF weather station, and precipitation from CESAMET, all relative to the 

October’11-September’12 period).

Bat activity 

 

Bat activity was sampled through acoustic monitoring. Acoustic sampling was done in 

three replicates of each habitat type, at a total of 24 sites. Sites were chosen at a 

minimum intervening distance of 1 km to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Since variation 

between nights and sites can be significant (Broders, 2003; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; 

Ford et al., 2005), each site was sampled twice a month, between October 2011 and 

September 2012, except during the months of April and July when the weather conditions 

only allowed each site to be sampled once. No sampling was carried out on nights with 

unfavourable weather conditions such as rain or strong winds, since bat activity (Ford et 

al., 2005, 2006) and detectability (Dixon, 2012) are negatively affected by these 

conditions. Acoustic sampling was done within the first 2.5h-3h after dusk, when bat 

activity levels are highest (Rydell et al., 1996; Hayes, 1997). The nightly order of site 

visitation was chosen randomly, so that data bias could be avoided. 

For each site, a 15-minute walking survey was carried out using a Pettersson D240x ultra-

sound detector (Pettersson Elektronik AB
TM

, Uppsala, Sweden) in heterodyne mode, 

rapidly travelling through the full range of frequencies so that the chance of detecting 

different bat species was maximized (Russ and Montgomery, 2002). Sample calls of 1.7 

seconds were recorded in time expansion mode into a digital recorder (Edirol R-09, 

Roland Corp., Shizuoka, Japan). Walking surveys were carried out at a regular pace so 

that all transects were approximately 500 m in length. 

Bat calls were analysed using Audacity 1.3.13 software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net). 

Call duration, inter-pulse interval, start and end frequencies and peak frequency 

(frequency containing most energy) were registered. Species identification was done 

using a reference collection of bat calls and dichotomous keys for Portuguese and Iberian 

bat species (Lisón, 2011; Rainho et al., 2011). When two species could not be 

distinguished by their echolocation calls, they were grouped into two-species complexes, 

as shown in Table 3.1. 

Three types of calls were discriminated: (1) echolocation passes, defined as a sequence 

of echolocation pulses emitted by bats while navigating and searching for food (Lookingbill 

et al., 2010), (2) feeding buzzes, characterized by an approach phase with progressively 

lower signal duration and pulse interval, ending in a series of short signals with high 

repetition rate (Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), and (3) social calls, defined as broadband 



CHAPTER 3 

 
32 

calls of longer duration than echolocation calls, with multiple low-frequency components 

(Altringham and Fenton 2009). 

Statistical analysis 

 

Patterns of species richness, diversity and composition 

 

We calculated three indices within the eight main habitat types that compose the BVL 

landscape: diversity, evenness and species richness. Since most diversity indices 

employed actually refer to entropies rather than true diversities (Keylock, 2005; Jost, 

2006), we used a conversion of the Shannon-Wiener index (H) on its “numbers 

equivalent” as a measure of diversity, as proposed by Jost (2006). Hereafter, this diversity 

measure is simply referred to as diversity (D). We also used a modified Pielou’s evenness 

– hereafter, termed evenness (E) – that was calculated using D instead of H. We then 

performed generalized linear models (GLM) and Tukey post-hoc multiple comparisons for 

each index to assess differences between seasons and habitat types. In addition, we 

performed an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) to evaluate the significance of the 

differences between the species composition of the studied habitats. 

 

Activity of species and guilds 

 

Several methods have been used in the literature to measure bat activity, such as 

counting the absolute numbers of search-phase echolocation calls (Avila-Flores and 

Fenton, 2005), counting the number of minutes in which bats are registered (McAney and 

Fariley, 1988), calculating the mean number of passes per night for each sampling site 

(Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003), summing the number of one-minute periods in which a 

species was recorded (Activity Index; Miller, 2001) or the sizes of files recorded in a 

specific space and time unit (Broders, 2003). However, despite this variety, none of the 

above methods discriminate between passes of commuting bats and passes actually 

made by bats foraging in the sampled site (Carmel and Safriel, 1998). For this reason, 

and to overcome differences in sampling effort, we estimated bat activity using the 

number of bat passes per 15 minute interval (i.e. the number of passes per transect).  

For the seven species with more than 10 recorded passes (Table 3.1), we performed a 

hierarchical clustering analysis based on percentage of habitat use and assessed 

species-specific temporal and spatial patterns of activity. 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 
33 

To test for overall bat activity, feeding activity and social behaviour dependence on habitat 

type and seasonality, we performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) on overall 

bat passes, feeding buzzes and social calls. We then carried out Tukey post-hoc multiple 

comparisons for each model to detect which habitats and seasons were significantly 

distinct. To evaluate differences in bat activity between habitats in each season, we 

performed GLMM on overall bat passes, followed by multiple comparisons. We also 

carried out GLMM to test for species activity dependence on habitat type and seasonality, 

together with multiple comparisons for each model to assess differences between habitats 

and seasons. Because species with low intensity or very high frequency calls may be 

underrepresented (Ciechanowski, 2002; Hayes et al., 2009), no comparisons between 

activity levels of different species were made.  Since echolocation-monitoring studies are 

unable to provide a true count of individuals (Hayes et al., 2009), the data was not 

interpreted as a measure of abundance, but rather as an estimate of bat activity. This 

enables the comparison of relative use between different habitat types and of the variation 

in habitat use over time (Hayes, 2000). 

We divided bat species into three guilds based on eco-morphological traits (Fenton, 1990; 

Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001). Species that have a fast and energetically inexpensive flight 

type, with high wing loading and aspect ratio, and emit long, narrowband and low-

frequency calls, were considered as “open-space foragers”. Species that present a slow 

and energetically inexpensive flight type, with average wing loading and aspect ratio, and 

echolocate through short pulses that are often composed of both broad and narrowband 

components, were considered as “edge foragers”. Lastly, species with low wing loading 

and aspect ratio, i.e. energetically expensive but very manoeuvrable flight, and whose 

echolocation is characterized by low-intensity, broadband calls, were considered as 

“closed-habitat foragers”. The species within each guild are presented in Table 3.1. Since 

we only recorded P. auritus/P. austriacus (the only closed-habitat species recorded) on 

one occasion, this guild was not included in the analysis. For the other two guilds, we 

performed GLMM and multiple comparisons, to assess differences in bat activity between 

habitat types and seasons. Calls identified to genus level or to species-complexes were 

included in this analysis whenever the group of potential species all belonged to the same 

guild. 

ANOSIM was performed with Past software, version 2.17c (Hammer et al., 2001); all the 

remaining statistical analysis were performed with software R, version 2.15.1 (R Core 

Team, 2013). The level of significance was established at p?0.05, although we also report 

and discuss near significant probability values at p&lt;0.1.

3.3. RESULTS 

 

Spatial patterns of species richness, diversity and composition 

 

Of the total of 1544 bat passes recorded during this study, we identified 1262 (82%) to 

species level (Table 3.1). The identified species (or two-species complexes) were 

Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus/E. isabellinus, Myotis daubentonii, M. 

escalerai, M. myotis/M. blythii, Nyctalus lasiopterus/N. noctula, N. leisleri, Pipistrellus 

kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Plecotus auritus/P. austriacus and Tadarida teniotis. 

The remaining recordings were classified as Eptesicus spp./Nyctalus spp.(13), Myotis 

spp. (13), Nyctalus spp. (26), Pipistrellus spp. (154) and unidentified calls (76).  

P. pygmaeus, P. pipistrellus and E. serotinus/E. isabellinus stood out as the most 

frequently recorded species, comprising a total of 91.2% of the calls identified to species 

level. These three species, along with N. lasiopterus/N. noctula, were recorded in all 

habitat types. Of the 12 identified species, five were rarely recorded (B. barbastellus, M. 

daubentonii, M. escalerai, P. kuhlii and P. auritus/P. austriacus), with less than 10 bat-

passes each. 

We found no significant differences in diversity, evenness and species richness between 

habitat types. Mean values of diversity, evenness and richness for all habitats and 

seasons are presented in Table 3.2. Species composition analysis, assessed through a 

one-way ANOSIM, revealed marginally non-significant differences between bat 

assemblages among the different habitat types (R=0.15; p=0.06). 

 

Spatial patterns of bat activity 

 

Cluster analysis of the percentage of total activity per habitat type for the seven species 

with more than 10 recorded passes (Figure 3.2) revealed three main clusters; one 

grouping the edge-forager M. myotis/M. blythii and the open-space forager N. leisleri, a 

second one constituted only by T. teniotis, and a third one grouping P. pipistrellus, P. 

pygmaeus, E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/ N. noctula. 

A high percentage of the total activity of M. myotis/M. blythii and N. leisleri occurred in 

forests (40.0 and 38.5%, respectively) and reed beds (20.0 and 26.9%, respectively). T. 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 
35 

teniotis showed highest activity in uncluttered habitats (82.4% in rice fields, sea rushes 

and reed beds) and it was separated from another cluster containing the genera 

Pipistrellus, Nyctalus and Eptesicus that occurred in all habitat types. Within this latter 

cluster of more generalist species in terms of habitat use, two sub-clusters were formed, 

which separated the Pipistrellus spp. from E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. 

noctula. Both P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus exhibited a high percentage of activity at 

urban sites (26.5 and 26.9%, respectively) and low activity in forest sites (only 5.3 and 

6.4%, respectively). Conversely, E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. noctula 

presented higher levels of activity in forest sites (28.4 and 16.7%, respectively) and lower 

values at human settlements (17.2 and 8.3%, respectively) compared to Pipistrellus 

species. 

GLMM and multiple comparisons revealed little influence of habitat type on overall bat 

activity, only showing that urban settings presented significantly more activity than 

marshlands (z=3.03; p=0.05).

Because overall bat activity was biased due to the high number of passes recorded for 

some species (e.g. over 75% of all bat passes were attributed to Pipistrellus spp.), we 

reran the models without the P. pygmaeus passes and carried out multiple 

comparisons. Again, we found no significant differences in bat activity between habitat 

types. The model only containing habitat type best explained the variation in overall bat 

passes, with the model incorporating both habitat type and season as independent 

variables also providing a good fit (?AIC&lt;2).

 Since only one species was registered in Autumn on maize fields, by its definition, evenness is not 

applicable  

 

Also, habitat type did not seem to influence the number of feeding buzzes recorded. 

Social calls, on the contrary, differed significantly between the urban and remaining 

habitats (p&lt;0.01); though it should be noted that all the acoustic social behaviour 

registered belonged to species of the genus Pipistrellus, particularly to P. pygmaeus 

(Table 3.1). The summaries of the models presenting best fit are presented in Table 

3.3.

The analysis of activity per guild revealed that edge foragers were significantly more 

active in urban areas, when compared to forest and marshlands (z=3.19, p=0.03 and 

z=3.50, p=0.01, respectively). However, once we repeated the analysis without P. 

pygmaeus, we found no significant differences in the activity of this guild between 

habitat types. Also, we found no significant differences between habitats in the activity 

of open-space foragers. 

 

 

Figure 3.2 Dendrogram resulting from the cluster analysis of percentage of habitat use, and 

representation of the most used habitat types by each of the resulting clusters. 

 

Habitat type significantly influenced the activity of N. leisleri and P. pygmaeus. The 

activity of N. leisleri was significantly higher in forest patches compared to rice fields or 

Bocage (z=3.57; p&lt;0.01). Nearly significant differences were also found for N. leisleri 

between forest sites and maize fields (z=2.83; p=0.08), and between sites of sea 

rushes and marshlands (z=2.78; p=0.10). P. pygmaeus had higher levels of activity in 

urban environments. Significant differences between this habitat and five others were 

found for this species: marshlands (z=4.33; p&lt;0.01), forest (z=4.03; p&lt;0.01), sea 

rushes (z=3.43; p=0.01), reed beds (z=3.15; p=0.04) and maize fields (z=3.10; p=0.04). 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 

39 

The remaining five species considered in this approach revealed no significant 

differences in activity amongst habitat types. The summary of the GLMM performed for 

each species is presented in Table 3.3. 

 

Seasonal patterns in bat assemblage structuring and activity 

 

Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in Spring compared to Autumn 

(z=3.20, p&lt;0.01 and z=3.73, p&lt;0.01, respectively). Evenness was significantly higher in 

Summer compared to Autumn (z=3.61, p&lt;0.01). As expected, bat activity was greatly 

reduced during the Winter so this season was excluded from the analysis. 

Overall bat activity, feeding activity and social behaviour did not vary significantly 

between seasons. However, within seasons, significant differences were found in 

overall bat activity among the studied habitat types. During the Spring, higher activity 

levels were recorded in urban, Bocage and maize field habitats. Significant differences 

were found between urban sites and the remaining habitat types (all p&amp;lt;0.01), with the 

exception of Bocage and maize fields. 

In Summer, rice fields and urban sites presented significantly more activity than the 

other habitats (all p&lt;0.01), but these two habitat types were not significantly different 

from each other in terms of this parameter. The least used habitat type was 

marshlands, which revealed significantly less activity compared to forests (z=-3.32, 

p=0.02), reed beds (z=-3.72, p&lt;0.01), urban (z=-4.52, p&lt;0.01) and rice fields (z=-6.61, 

p&lt;0.01). 

During Autumn, the highest levels of bat activity were registered in urban and Bocage 

sites, as occurred during Spring, but also on reed beds. We found significant 

differences in bat activity between urban sites and the remaining habitat types (all 

p&lt;0.01). Significant differences in bat activity were also found in Bocage and reed beds 

when compared to forest, marshlands, maize and rice fields (all p&lt;0.01). Maize fields 

and marshlands presented the lowest bat activity levels, and also revealed less activity 

when compared to the sea rushes habitat (z=-3.53, p&lt;0.01 and z=-4.66, p&lt;0.01, 

respectively). 

We found significant differences between seasons in the activity of the open-space 

foragers. This guild showed higher levels of activity in Spring than Autumn (z=3.93, 

p&lt;0.01) and Summer (z=2.69, p=0.02). In contrast, the activity of edge foragers did not 

change significantly across seasons. Regarding the species-specific temporal patterns, 

our results only revealed statistically significant differences in the activity of T. teniotis,

3.4. DISCUSSION 

 

Bat assembly structuring across habitats and seasons 

 

We found no significant differences in bat assemblage structure and composition 

among the different studied habitat types of the BVL landscape. This is in accordance 

with other studies showing that bats explore different patches within a landscape, and 

that fragmented, mosaic-shaped landscapes can still harbour several bat species (Law 

and Dickman, 1998; Bernard and Fenton, 2002, 2007). On the other hand, it might also 

suggest the presence of one assemblage making use of several distinct habitat 

patches. This may be the case if chosen sampling sites are close to each other, since 

some of the registered species have small home-ranges (e.g. P. pipistrellus and P. 

pygmaeus – Nicholls and Racey, 2006; Myotis myotis – Drescher, 2004), but not if 

sampling sites are several kilometres apart. Frequent movements between roosting 

and foraging sites located far apart are only possible for species known to fly long 



CHAPTER 3 

 

42 

distances and to possess large home-ranges (e.g. N. leisleri – Shiel et al., 1999; T. 

teniotis – Marques et al., 2004). In any case, land cover does not seem to strongly 

influence the occurrence of a species in a certain site within the BVL landscape, 

possibly due to the generalist character of the studied species (four of the seven most 

recorded species were registered in all sampled habitat types). We found significant 

variation in bat diversity, richness and evenness throughout the study period, which 

may be due to the temporal dynamics of resource distribution, such as prey and/or 

appropriate roost availability. 

We found similar values of species richness and diversity in forest sites when 

compared with the other studied habitats. However, evergreen woodlands, including 

Eucalyptus stands (which comprised the majority of our forest sites), are often 

associated with lower animal diversity and species richness, both in bats (Russo and 

Jones, 2003; Matos, 2011) and other taxa (Marsden et al., 2001; Zahn et al., 2009). 

The importance of broadleaved woodlands for several European bat species as 

foraging (Walsh and Harris, 1996; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Rainho, 2007; Sattler 

et al., 2007) and roosting habitats (Russo et al., 2004; Dietz et al., 2009; Boughey et 

al., 2011) is well known. However, evergreen woodlands, especially well-developed 

stands, may increase in importance when broadleaved woodlands are absent. Also, we 

expected species richness and diversity to be lower in urban sites, since only the most 

ubiquitous species often forage in these areas (Rydell, 1992). Although six of the 

twelve recorded species were not observed in urban sites during this study, the values 

of diversity and species richness did not differ significantly from those of other habitat 

types; although this may be due to a lack of statistical power. 

 

Spatial and seasonal patterns of activity 

 

Overall, we found few differences in the activity patterns of the different bat species 

across habitats. We found a positive influence of urban sites on the activity of P. 

pygmaeus, which is not unusual for this species (Rainho, 2007; Pocora and Pocora, 

2011). However, these bats are also usually found foraging in riparian sites (Vaughan 

et al., 1997; Russo and Jones, 2003; Davidson-Watts et al., 2006; Lundy and 

Montgomery, 2010), deciduous woodland (Glendell and Vaughan, 2002; Pocora and 

Pocora, 2011), woodland edges and other linear features such as hedgerows and tree 

lines (Glendell and Vaughan, 2002; Brandt et al., 2007). Other species of the genus 

Pipistrellus such as P. kuhlii and P. pipistrellus are known to forage in a wide range of 

habitat types and often feed around streetlamps (Blake et al., 1994; Carmel and Safriel, 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 

43 

1998; Russo and Jones, 2003) but P. pygmaeus, by comparison, seems to be more of 

a specialised and selective species (Davidson-Watts et al., 2006). The proximity of 

human settlements to wetlands and riparian habitats in the BVL landscape may provide 

P. pygmaeus with additional suitable foraging habitats, particularly surrounding 

streetlights in human settlements where high densities of prey may occur (Gaisler et 

al., 1998; Rydell, 1992; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). Our cluster analysis also 

revealed a positive tendency for more activity of both P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus 

in Bocage. The dense network of linear structures such as live fences found in this 

habitat type may provide optimal foraging sites and commuting routes for these 

species, as well as protection against predators and adverse weather conditions 

(Verboom and Huitema, 1997). These hedgerows, together with the numerous 

freshwater sources available in this habitat, also provide favourable conditions for 

many insect species (Harvey et al., 2005; Verboom and Huitema, 1997), thereby 

increasing their abundance and, presumably, their availability to bats. Indeed, the short 

wingspan and manoeuvrable flight of Pipistrellus, as well as the FM and QCF 

components of their search calls, enables them to forage close to vegetation in 

background-cluttered spaces (Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), ultimately giving them an 

advantage in exploiting such habitat. 

We also found a positive relation between forests and the activity of N. leisleri. 

Although woodland habitats or their edge structures are regarded as some of the 

preferred roosting and foraging habitats of this species (Dietz et al., 2009), some 

studies have demonstrated that N. leisleri often exhibits no habitat preferences, 

reflecting a somewhat generalist choice of foraging habitats (Russ and Montgomery, 

2002; Lundy and Montgomery, 2010). Also, Shiel and Fairley (1998) and Pocora and 

Pocora (2011) found higher levels of activity of this species in human settlements, 

particularly along roads and streetlamps. In this study, N. leisleri occurred in six of the 

eight studied habitats; though we cannot be sure whether the bats were foraging or just 

commuting. Through hierarchical clustering, some similarities were found between N. 

leisleri and M. myotis/M. blythii regarding percentage of habitat use (see Fig 2). 

Because M. myotis forages on the ground (Audet, 1990) and N. leisleri often forages 

over the canopy (Dietz et al., 2009), they are likely to explore different space and prey 

resources in similar habitat types. 

We found a positive influence of urban sites on overall bat activity, feeding activity and 

social behaviour, as well as in the activity of the edge-foragers guild. However, this bias 

towards urban environments is undoubtedly linked to the activity of P. pygmaeus, 

already described above. Despite that no differences were found between habitat types 



CHAPTER 3 

 

44 

for the activity of the open-space foragers guild, we found some similarities in the 

percentage of habitat use between E. serotinus/E. isabellinus and N. lasiopterus/N. 

noctula through the cluster analysis. Furthermore, this analysis confirmed the 

preference of T. teniotis for open-space, uncluttered habitats since this species almost 

exclusively used this type of setting and, particularly, rice fields, sea rushes and reed 

beds. 

Bat activity in the different habitat types varied throughout the study period. Since some 

insect prey is known to be more abundant during short periodic bursts of time (in a 

process called swarming) that can occur at different times of the year in distinct habitat 

types (de Jong and Ahlén, 1991), our results may reflect the response of bats to these 

shifts in prey availability (Robinson and Stebbings, 1997), as well as to the 

characteristic temporal heterogeneity of human-altered landscapes (DeCleck et al., 

2010).  

The higher activity of the open-space foragers guild and of T. teniotis in Spring may be 

explained by post-hibernation restoration of fat reserves (Ciechanowski et al., 2010). 

However, since pregnancy and lactation occur during summer, bat activity was 

expected to be higher in this season due to the increased energy demands of these 

life-cycle stages (Kunz, 1973; Encarnação and Dietz, 2006). However, the lower 

activity during the summer observed in this study might be explained by the fact that 

bat detectability was lower during this season due to significant noise disturbance 

produced by katydids. This is especially relevant for species with low-frequency calls, 

such as T. teniotis and those of the genus Nyctalus, since katydid song is usually 

emitted between 600Hz and 20kHz (del Castillo and Gwynne, 2007), corresponding 

partially or completely to the frequency intervals of their echolocation calls. The lower 

activity registered during the autumn might reflect bat dispersal to distant winter 

hibernacula. 

 

Heterogeneous landscape matrices as mosaics of opportunities 

 

Since few differences were found amongst the habitat types studied, two main 

scenarios can be considered: 1) landscape matrices can be regarded as mosaics of 

opportunities, enabling bats to exploit vital resources in distinct patches; 2) 

opportunities are scarce in fragmented landscapes, forcing bats to exploit less optimal 

habitats and resources.  

For the first scenario, we attribute the lack of differences to the generalist character of 

some of the recorded species (e.g. E. serotinus – Rainho, 2007; N. leisleri – Lundy and 



A MOSAIC OF OPPORTUNITIES 

 

45 

Montgomery, 2010; P. pipistrellus – Russo and Jones, 2003), and to a response by 

bats to temporal and spatial variation in resource availability. The response of bats to 

changes in resource availability, particularly to prey availability, has been described for 

some species such as E. serotinus (Robinson and Stebbings, 1997) and Pipistrellus 

species (Kusch and Idelberger, 2005). In fact, changes in food supply are considered 

to be one of the key factors behind seasonal changes in bat activity (Bartonicka and 

Zukal, 2003; Meyer et al., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010). Therefore, the observed 

fluctuation in use of foraging sites during the year can be interpreted as an exploitation 

of insect concentrations, rather than a consistent use of particular habitats (Swift et al., 

1985; Furlonger et al., 1987; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005). Bats usually require a mixed 

landscape in which adequate foraging, roosting and drinking sites can be found 

(Lookingbill et al., 2010). These vital habitats and resources are frequently widely 

scattered within the landscape. However, many species of bats are highly vagile and 

move readily within the landscape matrix to take advantage of the different available 

patches (Medina et al., 2007; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2011). Thus, combining the 

temporal and spatial variation of resource availability, the mobility of bats, their need for 

different habitats within a landscape, and the opportunistic character of most species, 

we assume that bats interpret the BVL landscape matrix as a whole, rather than 

selecting or exploiting the different habitat types individually. In this way, the 

heterogeneous landscape that characterizes the BVL region provides a mosaic of 

opportunities for bats, which freely exploit the resources across different land cover 

settings and according to their temporal variation. This is consistent with other studies 

that revealed that fragmented landscapes can still harbour high bat species richness 

and abundance, and that bats exploit the different settings present in the landscape 

(Bernard and Fenton, 2002; Estrada and Coates-Estrada, 2002; Gorresen and Willig, 

2004; Bernard and Fenton, 2007). 

The second scenario presents a more pessimistic view of the interaction between bats 

and the heterogeneous landscape. There are several known negative effects of 

fragmentation on animal species (e.g. Saunders et al., 1991). The intensification of 

agriculture (Wickramasinghe et al., 2003), pesticide use (Racey and Entwistle, 2003) 

and transformation of natural habitats into monocultures (Lacki et al., 2007) are also 

know to negatively influence bat diversity and populations. Since the BVL landscape is 

composed of a mosaic of natural and human-altered habitats, with significant coverage 

by agricultural fields (intensive and extensive) and forest monocultures, those negative 

effects are probably present. Since resource availability directly influences the 

development and maintenance of individuals and populations, anthropogenic changes 

that alter their abundance and distribution in space and time can have considerable 



CHAPTER 3 

 

46 

negative impacts on animal communities (Bradbury et al., 2001). Furthermore, human 

alterations of natural ecosystems may reduce the availability of optimal habitats, forcing 

some organisms to explore sub-optimal patches to which they might not be well-

adapted (Lambrechts et al., 2004). If that is the case in our study area, the scarcity of 

resources may be forcing bats to exploit the several habitat types that shape the 

landscape, regardless of their particular setting. This would explain the similar 

assemblages found over the different habitats, as well as the lack of differences found 

in the activity of guilds and species amongst them.  

Despite the fact that both scenarios could explain our findings, we believe that the 

particular case of the BVL landscape is closer to the first one, at least for some of the 

recorded bat species. Although some of the above-mentioned negative effects of 

human activities are probably affecting bat communities, it seems plausible that several 

of the bat species recorded, particularly the more opportunistic ones, still have an 

adequate mosaic of habitats where foraging and roosting sites can be found. Since 

large wetland and riparian areas, closely located to other habitats, characterize the 

BVL landscape, we believe that bats exploit the landscape as a whole, taking 

advantage of the resources available in different areas at different times of the year. 

Nevertheless, this may not be true for some of the species found in this study. The loss 

of important habitats, such as broadleaved woodland that has been transformed into 

agricultural land and evergreen forest monocultures, may negatively influence the strict 

forest-dwelling species, namely B. barbastellus and Plecotus spp., which were rarely 

recorded during this study.

4.1. ABSTRACT 

 

The conversion of natural environments into agricultural land has profound effects on 

the composition of the landscape, often resulting in  a mosaic of crop fields, pastures 

and remnant patches of natural vegetation. Although an increase in structural 

complexity of a habitat mosaic may improve the availability of ecological niches for 

animals, potentially increasing species diversity, the responses of organisms to these 

changes will be species-specific and scale-dependent. Bats are highly vagile, and their 

daily and seasonal resource needs often require the use of distinct habitats. 

Furthermore, the way they select a habitat is an aggregative response to both 

landscape and local features. We sampled bats acoustically, while simultaneously 

sampling insects with light traps, across 24 sampling sites within a heterogeneous 

landscape in Portugal, constituted by a mosaic of natural, semi-natural and human-

altered terrestrial and freshwater and brackish habitats. We then assessed the 

relationships between total bat activity, activity of distinct guilds, and species richness, 

with landscape and local features, across four distinct focal scales. Our results 

revealed both scale- and guild-dependent responses of bats to landscape and local 

features. At broader scales we found positive associations between open-space 



CHAPTER 4 

 

50 

foraging bats and habitat heterogeneity and, as expected, between edge-space 

foraging bats and greater edge lengths. At smaller scales, forest cover and water 

availability (for open-space foragers) and Bocage cover (for edge foragers) were the 

most efficient predictors. Locally, bat activity was strongly associated with weather 

conditions and insect abundance. Globally, our results suggest that bats are sensitive 

to local resource availability and distribution, while simultaneously reacting to broader 

landscape features. Also, our results suggest that forest and Bocage habitats are 

potential keystone structures for bats within this heterogeneous landscape. 

 

 

4.2. INTRODUCTION 

 

Land use change happens through both natural and anthropogenic processes. 

However, human actions are responsible for unprecedented and profound 

modifications on ecological systems worldwide (Lambin et al., 2001). In Europe there 

are hardly any landscapes that are not under any type of human influence (Meeus, 

1995), and farmland nowadays represents the majority of the land cover in the 

European territory (Robinson and Sutherland, 2002, Billeter et al., 2008).  

One of the most frequent changes is the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural 

land. The result is often the fragmentation of natural habitats (Haila, 2000) by the 

immersion of those remnant natural patches in a human-managed, agricultural matrix 

(Uematsu et al., 2010; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2013). Indeed, in Europe, 

agricultural landscapes are usually composed by a mosaic of crop fields, pastures and 

natural remnant patches, creating a landscape of high spatial (Duchamp and Swihart, 

2008) and temporal heterogeneity dictated by human activities and land management 

(Di Giulio et al. 2001; DeClerck et al. 2010; Gilroy et al. 2010). The increase in 

agriculture intensity and land abandonment are some of the main causes for 

biodiversity loss worldwide (Meeus, 1995; Lambin et al., 2001; Robinson and 

Sutherland, 2002; Uematsu et al., 2010), but low-intensive land-use systems may 

actually be positive for biodiversity conservation (Tscharntke et al., 2005).  

The “habitat heterogeneity hypothesis” assumes that an increase in structural 

complexity of a habitat mosaic leads to the availability of more ecological niches, and 

promotes several distinct opportunities for resource exploitation, resulting in greater 

species diversity (Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., 2004). Still, spatial heterogeneity affects 

the dispersal patterns of organisms, as well as their foraging behaviour (Johnson et al., 

1992), since resource availability may vary in different regions of the landscape, 

altering their suitability to the organism (Milne et al., 1989). However, the response of 



BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES 

 

51 

an organism to spatial heterogeneity depends strongly on its taxonomic group, its 

dispersion abilities, and its perception of the surrounding habitat (Kotliar and Wiens, 

1990; Malanson and Cramer, 1999; Tews et al., 2004). This response is also scale-

dependent, since a heterogeneous landscape likely to be easily explored by an 

organism might be impossible to exploit by another (Milne et al., 1989) due to eco-

morphological restraints. 

Bats are highly vagile, and many species depend on multiple habitats to fulfil their daily 

and seasonal needs, especially to deal with different requirements along the various 

stages of their life-cycle (Law and Dickman, 1998; Lookingbill et al., 2010). The 

process of habitat selection, i.e. their presence and use of a certain site within a 

landscape, results from a set of decisions at both the landscape and local scales (Ford 

et al., 2006). On a wider scale, bats are thought to respond to landscape configuration 

(e.g. patchiness, habitat diversity, land cover proportions), roost availability, proximity 

to adequate foraging sites and water sources, climatic conditions and anthropogenic 

disturbance (Furlonger et al., 1987; Gehrt and Chelsvig, 2003; Evelyn et al., 2004; Ford 

et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2008, Rainho et al., 2010). Locally, vegetation structure, 

eco-morphological traits and prey availability seem to be some of the most influential 

factors (Aldridge and Rautenbach, 1987; Ford et al., 2005, 2006; Johnson et al., 2008). 

Furthermore, bats also exhibit strong seasonal dynamics in activity and habitat use; 

this usually reflects the weather conditions, (e.g. winter survival or hibernation), the 

directly or indirectly related changes in prey availability, and the stage of the lif e-cycle 

(Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et al., 2004; Ciechanowski et al., 2010; Wang et 

al., 2010),  

Several studies have looked into the interaction between bats and the features of the 

landscape they inhabit, but they have mainly focused forested areas (e.g. Yates and 

Muzika, 2006; Perry et al., 2008), particularly in the tropics (e.g. Gorresen and Willig, 

2004; Gorresen et al., 2005; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009). Though 

some studies have recently looked into the responses of bats to landscape features in 

predominantly agricultural landscapes in temperate regions (e.g. Duchamp and 

Swihart, 2008; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011; Fuentes-

Montemayor et al., 2011, 2013; Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013) there are still important 

gaps concerning the knowledge of the patterns of bat occurrence in those landscapes 

and, most importantly, of the processes behind those patterns. Fuentes-Montemayor et 

al. (2011) and Duchamp and Swihart (2008) found a positive influence of the amount of 

forest cover on bat abundance, reinforcing the importance of woodland patches in 

landscapes where this habitat type is scarce. However, in both studies the response 

differed between species, according to their mobility and roosting preferences. 



CHAPTER 4 

 

52 

Fuentes-Montemayor et al. (2013) and Rainho and Palmeirim (2013) also found 

species-specific responses to landscape features on multispecies colonies, mainly 

driven by their degree of habitat specialization. Ethier and Fahrig (2011) found a 

positive influence of fragmentation on bat abundance, stating that landscape 

complementation is the main mechanism supporting that relationship. On the other 

hand, the results obtained by Popa-Lisseanu et al. (2009) showed a negative influence 

of habitat fragmentation on the populations of Nyctalus lasiopterus due to the increase 

of the distances between adequate roosting and foraging habitats (i.e. low landscape 

complementation, Dunning et al., 1992).  

In this study, we aim to investigate the relation between bat activity and species 

richness and the heterogeneous landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar, Central-West 

Portugal, through a multi-scale approach. Specifically, we aim to i) identify the 

landscape and local features that better explain bat activity and richness within the 

study area; ii) investigate if the response given by bat activity and richness to 

landscape characteristics varies across a gradient of focal scales; and iii) investigate 

how different bat guilds respond to landscape and local features. 

With this we expect to be able to understand factors affecting bat activity and richness 

within the Baixo Vouga Lagunar matrix, so that future research, conservation and land 

management plans may be supported on solid bases. Furthermore, we expect that the 

knowledge acquired with this study may also help in the interpretation of the 

relationship between bats and human-altered, heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere. 

 

 

4.3. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Study area 

 

The study area has an area of approximately 50,000 ha, and is located in the Aveiro 

district, on the Central-North Portuguese coast (Figure 4.1). It harbours the 

municipalities of Albergaria-a-Velha, Aveiro, Estarreja, Ílhavo, Murtosa, Oliveira de 

Azeméis and Ovar (40º39-52’N, 8º27-45’W), encompassing the Baixo Vouga Lagunar 

(BVL), as well as its surroundings. Hereafter we refer to our study area as BVL, 

although it encompasses a significant extension of its surroundings. The landscape is 

characterized by a heterogeneous landscape, with a mosaic of natural, semi-natural 

and human-altered habitats. The natural habitats include aquatic and terrestrial

53 

environments, in particular the Ria de Aveiro, an estuarine coastal lagoon. Over 34% of 

the area is occupied by agricultural land, both traditional and intensive.

The traditional form of agriculture is represented by the Bocage, which is a unique 

man-made habitat, characterized by small areas of crops and pastures, intersected by 

small freshwater courses and live fences of autochthonous trees (e.g. Alnus glutinosa, 

Salix atrocinerea, Quercus robur), shrub and herb hedgerows (e.g. Hedera spp., Rubus

spp.). In Portugal, this type of agricultural practice is limited to the BVL region, and 

otherwise in Europe only to southern France and northern England (Brito et al., 2010). 

The remaining agricultural lands are dedicated, to a small extent, to rice (Oryza sp.) 

production, and to a greater extent and more intensively, to maize (Zea mays) cultures. 

Woodlands are fragmented, and mostly composed by production, non-deciduous tree 

species, mainly Eucalyptus globulus, but also Pinus pinaster). Several villages, as well 

as numerous industries can be found both within and in the outskirts of BVL. 

This region is a transition zone between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean climates, 

with a strong influence from the Atlantic Ocean (Costa et al., 1998; Bonmatí et al., 

2006). During the study period (October 2011 - September 2012), mean air 

temperature was 14.5 ºC (oscillating between 8.5 ºC in February and 19.8 ºC in 

September), and mean annual humidity of 76.5% (data from CUF weather station). 

Accumulated precipitation varied between 5.6 mm in July and 194 mm in November, 

with an annual value of 627.6 mm (data from CESAMET).  

 

Bat sampling, identification and definition of eco-morphological guilds 

 

We sampled bats acoustically through 15-minute walking surveys, of approximately 

500 m, performed at a regular pace. Sampling was carried out on a total of 24 sites, 

divided in three replicates of eight habitat types characteristic of the BVL landscape: 

Bocage, forest, maize fields, marshlands, reed beds, rice fields, sea rushes and urban. 

We sampled each site twice a month, so that the variation between nights and sites 

could be taken into account (Broders, 2003; Wickramasinghe et al., 2003; Ford et al., 

2005). No sampling was performed on nights with unfavourable weather conditions 

such as rain or strong winds, since these are known to negatively influence bat activity 

(Ford et al., 2005, 2006) and detectability (Dixon, 2012). During April and July, there 

were adverse weather conditions, thus we were only able to sample once on each of 

these months. 

We performed the walking surveys within the first 2.5h-3h after dusk, when bat activity 

levels are highest (Rydell et al., 1996; Hayes, 1997), using a Pettersson D240x ultra-

sound detector (Pettersson Elektronik AB
TM

, Uppsala, Sweden) in heterodyne mode. 

To maximize the chance of detecting different bat species, we travelled at a constant 

and fast pace through the full range of frequencies (Russ and Montgomery, 2002). A 

digital recorder (Edirol R-09, Roland Corp., Shizuoka, Japan) was used to storage the 

1.7 seconds sample calls. For every transect, we registered air temperature, relative 

humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind velocity using a Kestrel 4000 hand-held 

weather station (Kestrel Meters
TM

, Birmingham, Michigan).  



BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES 

 

55 

We analysed bat calls with Audacity 1.3.13 software (http://audacity.sourceforge.net), 

and registered several parameters: call duration, inter-pulse interval, start and end 

frequencies and peak frequency (frequency containing most energy). Whenever 

possible, we identified calls to the species level, using a reference collection of bat calls 

and dichotomous keys for Portuguese (Rainho et al., 2011) and Iberian (Lisón, 2011) 

bats. We then divided bat species into three guilds, based on eco-morphological traits 

(Fenton, 1990; Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001): 

i) Open-space foragers – Species that emit long, narrowband and low-frequency 

calls, and are characterized by a fast and energetically inexpensive flight, with high 

wing loading and aspect ratio. Species included in this guild were Nyctalus spp., 

Eptesicus spp. and Tadarida teniotis; 

ii) Edge-foragers – Species that echolocate through short pulses often composed 

of both broad and narrowband components, that present a slow and energetically 

inexpensive flight type, and average wing loading and aspect ratio. Species included in 

this guild were Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis spp. and Pipistrellus spp.; 

iii) Closed-habitat foragers (CHF) – Species with low-intensity, broadband 

echolocation calls, characterized by low wing loadings and aspect ratio, and that 

present a very manoeuvrable, but energetically expensive flight. Species classified as 

closed-habitat foragers were those of the genus Plecotus. 

 

Insect sampling 

 

Insects were sampled using light traps, on the same sites where bat surveys were 

performed. The place where traps were set up was selected so that a compromise 

between the representativeness of the sampled habitat type and trap protection against 

theft and destruction was achieved. Placement sites where kept constant throughout 

the study period. Traps contained a tubular fluorescent actinic light (8W), frequently 

used to attract and capture insects (e.g. Sutton and Hudson, 1980; Birkinshaw and 

Thomas, 1999; Davis et al., 2011). We set the traps in the field before nightfall, prior to 

the walking surveys, within the path of the walking transects, and those were on for 

approximately two hours. Insect and bat sampling occurred simultaneously, but due to 

light traps’ theft, component malfunction or adverse weather conditions, the two 

monthly samples were not always possible. Captured insects were collected and stored 

in 70% ethanol for posterior identification in the laboratory. All insect sampling was 

carried out under the licenses number 385 / 2011/ CAPT and 99 / 2012 / CAPT (ICNF, 

Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas). We identified the arthropods to

the order level, using appropriate literature and dichotomous keys (e.g. Barrientos, 

1988; Chinery, 2007; Capinera, 2008), and total abundance was registered for each 

order and site. 

 

Landscape predictors 

 

We used ArcGIS 10.0 to create buffers of 1.5, 3 and 6 km radii around the mid-point of 

each transect. The different scales used intend to cover the known home ranges of the 

detected species, with low (e.g. P. pygmaeus, Nicholls and Racey, 2006), intermediate 

(e.g. M. myotis, Drescher, 2004), and high (e.g. N. leisleri, Shiel and Farley, 1999; T. 

teniotis, Marques et al., 2004) mobility. We used data from COS2007 (IGP, 2010) to 

classify the landscape into land cover types, and updated it so that it could include 

recent modifications, verified by us during dedicated field incursions and satellite 

imagery. For every buffer we calculated the percentage of each land cover class, and 

categorize them into six types: i) rice fields; ii) Bocage; iii) forest; iv) maize fields; v) 

wetland habitats (joint percentage of reed beds, sea rushes and marshlands); and vi) 

human (joint percentage of urban and industrial areas). Using ArcGIS, we also 

withdrew values of total edge (i.e. total length of the boundaries between adjacent 

patches of different land cover types) and watercourse lengths. We used Fragstats 4.1 

(McGarigal et al., 2012) and selected and calculated four landscape metrics: i) patch 

density (PD: number of patches per 100 ha); ii) Shannon diversity index (SHDI: 

landscape heterogeneity index); iii) area-weighted mean patch shape index 

(SHAPE_AM: measure of patch shape complexity, taking into account patch areas); 

and iv) contagion (CONTAG: index of landscape connectivity – considers both the 

dispersion and interspersion of patch types). The abovementioned variables (Table 

4.1) were chosen so that both landscape composition (e.g. land cover type proportions, 

watercourse length) and physiognomy (e.g. patch density, landscape connectivity) 

could be assessed (Dunning et al., 1992). 

 

Local predictors 

 

We used as local independent variables a set of weather, food availability, and habitat 

related predictors (Table 4.1). Weather predictors included air temperature and relative 

humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind velocity. Food availability predictors included 

the total number of insects captured, and the total number of individuals belonging to 

the orders Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Himenoptera and Hemiptera. We chose 

these orders because they were the most common in the captures and due to their

documented importance to the diet of insectivorous bats, particularly concerning the 

species recorded in this study (e.g. Swift et al., 1985; Waters et al., 1995; Vaughan, 

1997; Ramos Pereira et al., 2002; Kervyn and Libois, 2008; Dietz et al., 2009; Fuentes-

Montemayor et al., 2013). Habitat type and the normalized difference vegetation index 

(NDVI) of each site were also considered as independent variables at the local scale.

Statistical analysis 

 

All statistical analysis were performed with software R, version 2.15.1 (R Core Team 

2013), using the hier.part and lme4 packages. We used a hierarchical partitioning 

analysis (HPA, Chevan and Sutherland, 1991; McNally, 1996) to evaluate the 



CHAPTER 4 

 

58 

independent contribution of the 12 variables at the landscape and 12 variables at the 

local level to explain the variation of total bat activity, guild activity, and species 

richness. According to Olea et al. (2010), the HPA performed in the hier.part package 

for more than nine independent variables produces a considerable inconsistency, as 

the entering order of the variables affects their ranking. To avoid this bias (the 

probability of a variable changing its position), we performed the analysis with 100 

repetitions, with different entering orders of the explanatory variables, as suggested by 

Olea et al. (2010). The models were fit to data by the least-squares method (i.e. 

goodness-of-fit measures calculated by R-squared). We then ranked the variables and 

selected the ones that presented the highest independent contribution towards the 

variation of each of the four response variables. For each response variable, a set of 

nine independent variables was chosen, since it was verified that, for this number and 

less, the ranking does not change with different entering orders (Olea et al., 2010). 

Then a randomization test (function “rand.hp”) was done with 100 randomizations, to 

assess the significance of each variable in explaining the variation of the four response 

variables. We then created a subset composed by the potential predictors that returned 

significant after this approach, for each response variable, and performed generalized 

linear models (GLM) for the landscape datasets (since the number of levels for the 

random effects – replicate - was equal to the number of observations), and generalized 

linear mixed models (GLMM) for the local dataset, to identify which of variables best 

predicted bat activity (total bat and guild activity) and species richness at each scale. 

Model selection was performed using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC).  

Based on the results obtained both in HPA and model selection, we classified the 

relationships between response and explanatory variables similarly to Avila-Cabadilla 

et al. (2012). Three types of relationship are defined: i) robust: when a significant 

influence (significance level set at p?0.05) was verified between the dependent and 

independent variables in the HPA, and the explanatory variable was selected as one of 

the best predictors in the models; ii) those denoting a tendency: when an explanatory 

variable explains a great amount of the variation of the response variable, but no 

significant relationship was found between them in the HPA, and it was selected as 

part of the best-fitted models; and iii) no relationship: when no significant or near 

significant relationship was found between response and explanatory variables in the 

HPA, and the explanatory variable was not selected in the best models.

4.4. RESULTS 

 

Bat diversity 
 

Through the total 1544 bat calls recorded during this study, we identified 12 species (or 

two-species complexes): Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus/E. isabellinus, 

Myotis daubentonii, M. escalerai, M. myotis/M. blythii, Nyctalus lasiopterus/N. noctula, 

N. leisleri, Pipistrellus kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Plecotus auritus/P. 

austriacus and Tadarida teniotis (Table 4.2). We were able to classify 1468 (95.1%) 

calls as belonging to species of the three guilds abovementioned. 245 calls (15.9%) 

were attributed to the open-space foragers, and 1222 (79.1%) to the edge foraging 

guild (Table 4.2). Since only one call was recorded for the closed-habitat foragers (P. 

auritus/P. austriacus), we excluded this guild from further analyses.  

 

Insect abundance 
 

A total of 40432 insects were captured, belonging to the orders Diptera, Himenoptera, 

Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Dictyoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Embioptera, Neuroptera, 

Trichoptera, Psocoptera, Odonata and Dermaptera. The most frequent orders were 

Hemiptera (24895 individuals; 61.6%), Coleoptera (7188; 17.8%), Diptera (5361; 

13.3%), Lepidoptera (2200; 5.4%) and Himenoptera (675; 1.7%). These five orders 

were selected as explanatory variables for the 12-variable dataset used in the HPA.  

 

Relation between bat activity and landscape and local variables 
 

Based on HPA results and model selection (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4, respectively), we 

found that total bat activity tended to be associated with different landscape predictors, 

at the different scales approached. At the 6 km focal scale, we found that bat activity 

tended to be negatively related to the percentage of forest cover, but positively 

associated with increasing areas of maize fields. At the 3 km scale, bat activity tended 

to be higher when larger extensions of Bocage were present. On the other hand, bat 

activity tends to be negatively associated with patch density and percentage of rice 

fields at this scale. Confining the scale to the 1.5 km level, a similar positive tendency 

was found between bat activity and the percentage of Bocage cover. Additionally, at 

the 1.5 km focal scale, bat activity tended to be positively linked with the percentage of 

rice field cover. 

At the local scale, we found a robust positive association between bat activity and air 

temperature and Diptera abundance. Furthermore, bat activity tended to vary with 

habitat type (marginally non-significant higher activity on urban sites; p=0.08), and 

tended to be negatively related with atmospheric pressure.

Relation between guild activity and landscape and local variables 

 

At the 6 km scale, the activity of the open-space foraging species tended to be positively 

associated with patch density. Furthermore, this relation continued at the 3 km focal scale, 

since a robust positive association was between the two. Also, the activity of the open -

space foragers tended to be negatively related with landscape connectivity. At the 

smallest landscape scale (1.5 km), the activity of the open-space foraging guild was 

robustly and positively linked with forest cover and total watercourse length. At the local 

scale we found a robust, positive association between the activity of the open-space 

foragers and the abundance of Lepidoptera. 

Concerning the activity of the edge-foragers, it tended to be higher with greater edge 

lengths, and lower when greater extensions of maize fields were present, at the 6 km focal 

scale. At the 3 km scale, we found that the activity of the edge-foraging guild tended to be 

negatively related to patch density. At the 1.5 km focal scale, the activity of this guild 

tended to be positively related with patch shape complexity, and with percentage of 

Bocage cover. At the local level, a robust positive association between the activity of the 

edge foragers and air temperature was found. Additionally, the activity of these species 

was robustly linked to the abundance of Diptera, and negatively to Coleoptera abundance 

and atmospheric pressure. Despite the strong associations established for the activity of 

edge-foragers at the local scale, the model presenting best fit only included air-

temperature as an explanatory variable (Table 4.4).  

 

Species richness 

 

No relationships were found between species richness and landscape variables neither at 

the 6 and 3 km scales. At the 1.5 km scale, species richness tended to be positively 

associated with forest cover. However, the null model still presented the best fit (Table 

4.4).  

At the local scale, we found a robust relationship between species richness and air 

temperature. A positive tendency towards the abundance of Lepidoptera was also found, 

although this predictor was not included in the best model (Table 4.4).

4.5. DISCUSSION 

 

Bat responses across landscape scales 

 

Habitat heterogeneity, at least to a certain level, has been linked to higher abundance 

and/or diversity of several taxa, such as birds (MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961; Gilroy et 

al., 2010), small terrestrial mammals (Cramer and Willig, 2002; Dalkvist et al., 2011), and 

carnivores (Mestre et al., 2007; Pita et al., 2009). Bats are also no exception to this 

(Bernard and Fenton, 2002; Estrada and Coates-Estrada, 2002; Gorresen and Willig, 

2004; Yates and Muzika, 2006; Bernard and Fenton, 2007; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011). In 

some situations, a matrix characterized by several interspersed patches of small size and 

varying land cover type seems to provide complementary resources for bats (Cramer and 

Willig, 2005; Ethier and Fahrig, 2011) some of them vital, such as roosting, foraging and 

drinking sites (Law and Dickman, 1998), within short distances.  

Our results indicate that a higher number of patches per unit of area favours the activity of 

the species that compose the open-space foragers guild. This is supported by the robust, 

positive relationship, found between the activity of the open-space foragers and patch 

density at the 3 km focal scale, following a similar tendency at the 6 km scale. Despite not 

providing information on patch type, size and distribution, this landscape metric can be 

interpreted as a simple measure of landscape fragmentation (Dewan et al., 2012). This 

may reinforce the importance of the mosaic of habitats for bats if the patch types are 

diverse, which is likely due to the heterogeneous character of the study area.  

Our findings are consistent to those of Klingbeil and Willig (2009) and Estrada-Villegas et 

al. (2010), who also found positive effects of fragmentation on the abundance of species 

adapted to forage in open areas. Habitat use is strongly dependent on species eco-

morphological traits (Fenton, 1990; Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001), so bat responses to 

habitat fragmentation and heterogeneity are expected to vary among guilds and species. 

That hypothesis was supported by our results since, contrary to the open-space foragers, 

the activity of the edge foragers tended to be lower with higher patch densities, at least at 

the 3 km focal scale. Fuentes-Montemayor et al. (2013), also found a negative influence 

of fragmentation on edge-foraging species such as those of the genera Pipistrellus and 

Myotis. Additionally, Estrada-Villegas et al. (2010) found a similar influence of 

fragmentation on closed-habitat foragers, justified mostly by their slow and manoeuvrable 

flight, which makes long commuting flights energetically expensive. 



BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES 

 
65 

Several authors have found higher levels of bat activity near linear structures and habitat 

edges (e.g. Verboom and Huitema, 1997; Lentini et al., 2012). Our results go in 

accordance with those studies. First, the activity of the edge foragers, at least at the 6 km 

focal scale, tended to be higher with greater edge lengths, though this was a relation not 

followed by open-space foraging species. Furthermore, at the 1.5 km scale, the activity of 

the edge-foragers tended to be higher with an increase in patch shape complexity. 

Greater shape complexity often implies longer boundaries between habitats (i.e. edge), 

reinforcing the aforesaid relationship. Contrary to our results, Fuentes-Montemayor et al. 

(2013) found woodland edge density to be negatively associated with the activity of 

Pipistrellus and Myotis species, and that the activity of these species was higher in 

woodland interior than in woodland edge.  

Also, both total bat activity (at the 3 km and 1.5 km focal scales) and the activity of edge 

foraging bats (at the 1.5 km focal scale) tended to be higher when greater percentages of 

Bocage land cover were present. The greater availability of linear structures such as the 

typical live fences of this habitat type may provide species like P. pipistrellus and P. 

pygmaeus optimal foraging sites, as well as protection against predators and adverse 

weather conditions (Verboom and Huitema, 1997). The dense network of freshwater 

channels along with those hedgerows may work as a commuting route for these bats, 

while also providing drinking water. The positive tendencies found between the activity of 

edge foragers and total edge length, shape complexity and Bocage land cover emphasise 

the importance of edge habitats and linear structures for species that share the eco-

morphological traits that characterize this guild – slow and energetically inexpensive flight 

type, average wing loading and aspect ratio, and echolocation pulses composed of both 

broad and narrowband components. 

At the smallest landscape scale studied – 1.5 km – we found strong associations between 

the activity of open-space foragers and the percentage of forest cover and length of 

watercourses. Forest importance for European bat species is well documented, both as 

foraging (e.g. Vaughan et al., 1997; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Davidson-Watts et al., 

2006) and roosting (Russo et al. 2004; Dietz et al. 2009; Boughey et al. 2011) habitats, 

thus the importance of the amount of forest on bat activity is not surprising. Boughey et al. 

(2011) found that, within a small scale, roost location of E. serotinus (among other 

species) was strongly associated with the proximity of woodland patches. Species of the 

genus Nyctalus are also known to roost within woodland patches, mainly on tree holes 

(Dietz et al., 2009; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009), while T. teniotis often uses woodland 

habitats as foraging grounds (Marques et al., 2004; Rainho, 2007; Matos et al., 2011). 



CHAPTER 4 

 
66 

However, the forests of the BVL landscape are mostly Eucalyptus stands, which are often 

associated with lower animal diversity and abundance, including bats (e.g. Russo and 

Jones 2003; Matos 2011) and other taxa (e.g. arthropods, Zahn et al. 2009; birds, 

Marsden et al. 2001; Proença et al., 2010; small non-volant mammals, Carey and 

Johnson, 1995), and do not seem to provide suitable roosts for bats. However, these 

forested areas still harbour some autochthonous trees such as Quercus sp. that, despite 

having low densities, may enable the occurrence of some bat species by providing some 

roosts.  

The strong relationship found between the activity of open-space foragers and total 

watercourse length reinforces the importance of riparian habitats for bats (e.g. Walsh and 

Harris, 1996; Grindal et al., 1999; Rainho, 2007). Freshwater courses not only provide a 

source of drinking water for bats, but these and the several brackish water channels 

present in the study area may also function as foraging grounds (Menzel et al., 2005; 

Rainho, 2007; Lookingbill et al., 2010) and commuting routes (Grindal et al., 1999; Fukui 

et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2006). 

 

Bat responses at the local scale 

 

Air temperature is one of the most limiting factors of bat activity in temperate regions, 

either through direct influence or subsequent food shortages during the cold winter 

months (Kapfer and Aron, 2007). Indeed, we found that weather conditions, particularly air 

temperature, strongly influence bat activity and species richness; the models presenting 

best fits for the activity of edge foragers and species richness only included this predictor. 

Within the study area, local variation in air temperature was clear, varying within the same 

night, between different sites, up to 6.8ºC.  

We also found robust associations between prey abundance and bat activity. However, 

bats response to prey abundance differed between open-space and edge-space foraging 

bats. While the activity of open-space foragers was strongly associated with the 

abundance of Lepidoptera, the activity of the edge foragers was linked with the 

abundance of Diptera.  

Open-space foragers are known to feed on Lepidoptera. T. teniotis seems to mainly feed 

on this taxa (Rydell and Arlettaz, 1994), which also constitutes a great part of the diet of E. 

serotinus (Robinson and Stebbings, 1993; Kervyn and Libois, 2008; Mikula and Cmoková, 

2012). The feeding on Lepidopera by Nyctalus spp. has also been documented (Waters et 

al., 1995; Dietz et al., 2009, and references therein). This seems to justify the strong 

positive relationship between the activity of open-space foragers and the abundance of 



BATS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES 

 
67 

Lepidoptera. On the other hand, the strong association between the activity of edge-space 

foragers and the abundance of Diptera may be related to the preference shown by P. 

pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus (the most frequently recorded species) for those prey (Swift 

et al., 1985; Barlow, 1997; Vaughan, 1997; Bartonicka et al., 2008). 

 

Keystone structures and vital resources in a heterogeneous landscape 

 

Tews et al. (2004) defined a keystone structure as “a distinct spatial structure providing 

resources, shelter or ‘goods and services’ crucial for other species”. Under the light of 

such definition, and taking in consideration our results, we may assume that woodlands 

represent a keystone structure for the open-space foragers guild. Our results also suggest 

that Bocage may represent a keystone structure for the edge-foraging species.  

As expected, prey abundance (for both guilds) and freshwater availability (for open -space 

foragers) stood out as important predictors of bat activity. Changes in food supply are 

considered to be one of the key factors determining spatial (Robinson and Stebbings, 

1997; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005) and seasonal (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et 

al., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010) variation in bat activity. Our results suggest that, 

within the heterogeneous landscape of BVL, bat activity is not mainly limited by land cover 

type, but rather by prey abundance and weather conditions. Therefore, we may assume 

that the habitat types that shape the BVL matrix provide a high complementation of 

resources, though woodlands and Bocage probably act as keystone structures. 

 

Conclusions 

 

Bat activity and distribution within the heterogeneous landscape of the BVL seems to be 

under the influence of several environmental factors, acting at different levels and scales. 

Overall, bats seem to respond to different factors, from wider scales where landscape 

physiognomy variables (i.e. fragmentation and edge length) are the most influencing ones, 

to a finer one where keystone habitats and vital resources (e.g. roosting sites and 

freshwater availability) are the limiting factors. At a local scale, prey availability and 

weather conditions (mainly air temperature) are the main factors dictating site selection. 

Our results support the findings of several studies that described scale-dependent effects 

of environmental variables on various aspects of the ecology of bats (e.g. Gorresen et al., 

2005; Perry et al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009; Ethier and 

Fahrig, 2011) and other taxa (e.g. plants, Graham and Knight, 2004; Okland et al., 2006; 



CHAPTER 4 

 
68 

fish, Yeager et al., 2011; small non-volant mammals, Morris, 1992; and marsupials, Lyons 

and Willig, 2002).  

Bats seem to be sensitive to local resource availability and distribution, while 

simultaneously reacting to broader landscape features. However, the smallest and wider 

scales to which an organism responds depends on the animals’ eco-morphology (i.e. size, 

mobility, life-history traits) since a given mosaic can be interpreted in a “fine-grained” way 

by a certain species, and in a “coarse-grained” fashion by others (Kotliar and Wiens, 

1990), sometimes even in the same family or order. Furthermore, different species may 

respond to distinct landscape features, depending on those eco-morphological traits. Our 

results revealed different influencing variables on the activity of the open-space and edge-

space foraging guilds. Similar results were obtained by Klingbeil and Willig (2009), who 

found guild-specific responses to forest fragmentation. Gorresen et al. (2005), Perry et al. 

(2008), Pinto and Keitt (2008) and Ethier and Fahrig (2011) also found species-specific 

responses to distinct landscape features, such as patch size, shape and proximity, forest 

cover, and woodland characteristics. Some of these species-specific responses may be 

masked by our analysis at the guild level, since it mostly reflects the responses of the 

dominant taxa. Further work, and more robust data is necessary to assess those species-

specific responses in the BVL landscape, particularly to closed-habitat foragers, since we 

were not able to investigate their interaction with the heterogeneous landscape of BVL. 

Most likely, landscape fragmentation and heterogeneity will be found to negatively affect 

these species, since they are strictly associated with forested habitats, and due to their 

eco-morphological traits (e.g. slow and energetically expensive flight) they have low 

mobility, thus making commuting between distant patches too costly. Still, our approach is 

certainly more detailed than one performed, for instance, at the assemblage level, 

because it provides some insight on the differences between functional groups (Klingbeil 

and Willig, 2009).  

Our study underlines the importance of multi-scale approaches to effectively assess the 

influence of landscape composition and physiognomy on bat activity. Furthermore, a 

deeper look into species-specific and/or guild responses is essential. In fact, such 

analyses may enable the identification of the most important landscape characteristics for 

the studied taxa, as well as of keystone structures and vital resources, facilitating the 

recognition of important conservation areas, and the design of effective conservation 

plans as an important support for land management.

5. GENERAL DISCUSSION 

 

5.1 STUDY DESIGN AND MAIN FINDINGS 

 

BVL is a coastal wetland. Here the landscape is composed by a matrix of natural, semi-

natural and human-altered habitats. Despite being known as a rich area in terms of 

biodiversity (Brito et al., 2010), little is known about the spatial and seasonal patterns of 

vertebrate distribution, and about the factors that underline those patterns. In this study, 

we assessed several aspects of the ecology of bats, so that the interaction between this 

group of animals and the heterogeneous landscape of BVL could be better understood.  

Firstly, we investigated the composition and structuring patterns of bat assemblages, and 

compared those patterns among seasons and among the main habitats that shape the 

landscape. Secondly, we assessed the spatial dynamics of bat activity, so that the habitat 

preferences of bats could be unveiled, taking into consideration their differences in 

foraging strategy and morphology. Furthermore, we also studied differences in bat activity 

across seasons. Subsequently, it was important to focus on the processes that underline 

those patterns. Thus, we assessed the influence of several features acting at local and 

landscape on the patterns of bat richness and activity. Moreover, we investigated the 

scale-dependency of the response given by bat activity and richness, by analysing the 

effects of the features across a gradient of focal scales. Finally, we analysed the different 

responses given by different bat guilds, composed by species with distinct eco-

morphological traits, to landscape and local features.  

The main findings/conclusions obtained through each of the abovementioned steps are: 

 

Bat assembly structuring across habitats and seasons 

 

i) Bat assemblage structure and composition was found to be similar among the 

eight habitat types studied; 

ii) A significant variation in bat diversity, richness and evenness was found 

throughout the study period. 

 

Spatial and seasonal patterns of activity 

 

i) Overall, few differences in the activity patterns of the different bat species across 

habitats were found;  



CHAPTER 5 

 
72 

ii) Higher activity levels were detected in urban sites (P. pygmaeus), Bocage (P. 

pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus) and forests (N. leisleri); 

iii) Bat activity in the different habitat types varied throughout the study period, 

probably due to shifts in prey availability. 

 

Conclusions 

 

i) Bats seem to interpret the BVL landscape matrix as a whole, rather than selecting 

or exploiting the different habitat types individually; 

ii) The heterogeneous landscape that characterizes the BVL region seems to provide 

a mosaic of opportunities for bats, which freely exploit the resources across different land 

cover settings and according to their temporal variation. 

 

Bat responses across landscape scales 

 

i) Bat activity responses to landscape features are both scale- and guild-dependent; 

ii) At broader scales, bats seem to respond to mainly to landscape physiognomy 

features, such as fragmentation, patch shape complexity and edge length, while at finer 

scales, landscape composition features such as land cover proportions and water 

availability, seem to be the most influencing ones; 

 

Bat responses at the local scale 

 

i) Locally, bat activity is driven mainly by weather conditions (particularly air 

temperature) and by prey abundance. 

 

Conclusions 

 

i) Bats seem to respond to different factors, from wider scales where landscape 

physiognomy variables (i.e. fragmentation and edge length) are the most influencing ones, 

to a finer one where keystone habitats and vital resources (e.g. roosting sites and 

freshwater availability) are the limiting factors; 

ii) Site selection is not mainly limited by land cover type, but rather by prey 

abundance and weather conditions; 

iii) Woodlands and Bocage may be regarded as “keystone structures” for bats within 

the BVL landscape. 

 



DISCUSSION

5.2 BATS AND THE HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE OF BAIXO VOUGA LAGUNAR 

 

Since bat assemblages of the sampled habitat types were similar, and almost no species-

habitat associations were established, bats seem to exploit all habitat types present in the 

BVL landscape. This may be partly explained by the generalist character of some of the 

recorded species (e.g. E. serotinus, Rainho, 2007; N. leisleri, Lundy and Montgomery, 

2010; P. pipistrellus, Russo and Jones, 2003). Furthermore, many species may depend 

on multiple habitats to fulfil their daily and seasonal needs, especially to deal with different 

requirements along the various stages of their life-cycle stages (Law and Dickman, 1998; 

Lookingbill et al., 2010). An increase in the structural complexity of a habitat mosaic leads 

to the availability of more ecological niches, and promotes several distinct opportunities 

for resource exploitation (habitat heterogeneity hypothesis, Bazzaz, 1975; Tews et al., 

2004). Since bats are highly vagile, able to readily move between adjacent patches within 

the BVL heterogeneous landscape, they are probably able to exploit the different 

resources provided by different patches, and according to their temporal fluctuations. The 

BVL landscape contains different patch types, potentially providing adequate foraging and 

roosting habitats, as well as vital resources such as freshwater and prey, all located within 

short distances (landscape complementation, Dunning et al., 1992); this is probably the 

reason why land cover influence was shown to be relatively reduced.  

 

 

5.3 ‘KEYSTONE STRUCTURES’ AND VITAL RESOURCES 

 

From the analysis performed, three habitat types stand out from the remaining, 

concerning the levels of bat activity. Firstly, urban sites revealed higher levels of activity of 

P. pygmaeus, and a positive tendency to higher levels of total bat activity and of edge 

foraging species. Foraging in urban environments is not an unusual behaviour for several 

species of bats, since high densities of prey may occur, particularly around streetlights 

(Gaisler et al., 1998; Rydell, 1992; Avila-Flores and Fenton, 2005). The proximity of 

human settlements to woodlands and riparian habitats in the BVL landscape, may also 

provide these species with additional suitable foraging habitats.  

The activity of N. leisleri was positively related to forest sites, and a strong positive relation 

was found between the activity of the open-space foraging guild and forest cover, at the 

finest landscape scale approached. The importance of woodlands for European bat 

species is well documented, both as foraging (e.g. Vaughan et al., 1997; Russ and 

Montgomery, 2002; Davidson-Watts et al., 2006) and roosting (Russo et al., 2004; Dietz et 



CHAPTER 5 

 
74 

al., 2009; Boughey et al., 2011) habitats. Of the open-space foraging species, E. serotinus 

was found to select roosts closely located to woodland patches (Boughey et al., 2011), 

while species of the genus Nyctalus usually roost within them, mainly on tree holes (Dietz 

et al., 2009; Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009). T. teniotis, on the other hand, its known to use 

these habitats as foraging grounds, where it usually feeds above the canopy (Marques et 

al., 2004; Rainho, 2007; Matos et al., 2011).  

Laslty, higher levels of activity of both P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus were found in 

Bocage, and linked to higher activity levels of the edge foraging guild at two focal scales. 

The greater availability of linear structures such as the typical live fences of this habitat 

type may provide these species optimal foraging sites, as well as protection against 

predators and adverse weather conditions (Verboom and Huitema, 1997). The dense 

network of freshwater channels along with those hedgerows may work as a commuting 

route for these bats, while also providing drinking water. 

Following the definition of “keystone structure” provided by Tews et al. (2004), the 

classification of these habitats as keystone structures for bats within the heterogeneous 

landscape of BVL seems reasonable. 

 

As expected, vital resources stood out as important predictors of bat activity. The activity 

of both guilds was influenced by prey abundance (Diptera for the edge-foraging species, 

and Lepidoptera for the open-space foragers), and the activity of the open-space foragers 

was also positively related to freshwater availability. Changes in food supply are 

considered to be one of the key factors determining spatial (Robinson and Stebbings, 

1997; Kusch and Idelberger, 2005) and seasonal (Bartonicka and Zukal, 2003; Meyer et 

al., 2004; Ramos Pereira et al., 2010) variation in bat activity. Our results revealed that 

prey abundance and weather conditions, particularly air temperature, despite related, 

were the variables that better explained the seasonal changes in bat activity in the BVL. 

Furthermore, prey abundance seemed to influence more the process of site selection than 

land cover type, emphasising the opportunistic character of several species. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



DISCUSSION 

 
75 

5.4 SCALE- AND GUILD-DEPENDENCY OF THE RESPONSES GIVEN BY BATS 

 

We found that bat activity and richness, within the heterogeneous landscape of BVL, 

seem to be influenced by landscape physiognomy and composition, and regulated by 

weather conditions and prey abundance. Furthermore, we found that the responses given 

by bats to these features changed across a scale gradient. The results obtained in this 

study support the findings of several works that described scale-dependent effects of 

environmental variables on various aspects of the ecology of bats (e.g. Gorresen et al., 

2005; Perry et al., 2008; Pinto and Keitt, 2008; Klingbeil and Willig, 2009; Ethier and 

Fahrig, 2011) and other taxa (e.g. plants, Graham and Knight, 2004; Okland et al., 2006; 

fish, Yeager et al., 2011; small non-volant mammals, Morris, 1992; and marsupials, Lyons 

and Willig, 2002). However, the eco-morphological traits of an organism, such as size, 

mobility and life-history traits, limit the scale to which it responds to environmental 

features. In fact, a given mosaic can be interpreted in a “fine-grained” way by a certain 

species, and in a “coarse-grained” fashion by others (Kotliar and Wiens, 1990), therefore 

species with different eco-morphological traits are expected to respond differently. 

Accordingly, species differing in morphology and hunting strategies were found to respond 

to different landscape features within the BVL. Similar results were obtained by Klingbeil 

and Willig (2009), who found guild-specific responses to forest fragmentation. Gorresen et 

al. (2005), Perry et al. (2008), Pinto and Keitt (2008) and Ethier and Fahrig (2011) also 

found species-specific responses to distinct landscape features, such as patch size, 

shape and proximity, forest cover, and woodland characteristics.  

 

 

5.5 CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS 

 

Future strategies designed towards the conservation of bats within the BVL landscape, or 

on heterogeneous landscapes elsewhere, should include a multi-scale approach, so that it 

can effectively manage both landscape composition and physiognomy features that 

promote the activity and richness of bat species. Furthermore, since species respond 

differently to landscape features, species-specific analysis should be performed. Such 

analyses may enable the identification of the most important landscape characteristics for 

the studied taxa, as well as of keystone structures and vital resources, facilitating the 

recognition of important conservation areas, and the design of effective conservation 

plans as an important support for land management. However, species-specific 

approaches often involve greater costs and human resources, and are frequently time-



CHAPTER 5 

 
76 

consuming. Thus, alternatively, a guild-specific approach may be applied, since it provides 

information for a group of species sharing eco-morphological traits. Nonetheless, guild-

level approaches may mask the rarest species responses, as it reflects mainly the 

responses of the dominant taxa. Therefore, the identification of umbrella species is critical 

for prioritizing conservation areas (Rainho and Palmeirim, 2013).  

 

Woodlands (forest patches and Bocage) were found to be the most important habitats for 

bats within the BVL landscape, probably acting as keystone structures for these animals. 

These habitats may provide adequate roosting and foraging habitats, while additionally 

offering commuting routes and freshwater, through the linear structures and water courses 

found on Bocage. However, the absence of broadleaved woodlands may negatively affect 

the strict forest-dwelling species such as B. barbastellus and Plecotus spp., which were 

rarely recorded during this study. Although the detectability of bats sampled is lower within 

forest patches (Walsh et al., 2004) where these species forage and roost, the few 

recordings we got may also suggest they are rare within the BVL landscape. Therefore, 

the creation/restoration of broadleaved woodlands may be adequate to provide additional 

roosting and foraging habitats for these species, while also favouring other bats that 

usually roost in such habitats, such as those of the genus Nyctalus (Dietz et al., 2009; 

Popa-Lisseanu et al., 2009). 

 

Lastly, the results obtained in this study revealed that higher levels of the activity of some 

species were related to edge length and to Bocage cover, which is composed by a dense 

network of linear structures. Since a great proportion of the BVL landscape is composed 

by maize fields, characterized by great areas of crop fields, managed in a somehow 

intensive fashion, the promotion of hedgerows and tree lines around them may also favour 

bat activity and occurrence. Linear elements such as those, have also been found to 

positively influence bat activity in agricultural areas in other studies (Verboom and 

Huitema, 1997; Russ and Montgomery, 2002; Fuentes-Montemayor et al., 2011; Lentini et 

al., 2012). The creation of these structures around the larger crop fields may provide 

foraging and roosting habitats for bats, as well as protective commuting routes in these 

open areas. Furthermore, promoting the activity of insectivorous bats near crop fields may 

result in a better control of insect pests species, thus resulting in a direct service to human 

populations. 

 

 



DISCUSSION 

 
77 

5.6 FUTURE WORKS 

 

Future research on bat ecology in the BVL should focus on species-specific responses to 

landscape composition and physiognomy. Such approaches may elucidate the differences 

among species, and enable the assessment of the responses given by rare species. 

Furthermore, these analyses may allow the identification of umbrella species, and 

therefore provide essential information for future conservation plans. 

Since roost availability is one of the most limiting factors for bat distribution within a 

region, further studies should be made about roost availability within the BVL landscape, 

particularly for species that depend on woodlands for roosting, namely species from the 

genera Nyctalus and Plecotus, and for B. barbastellus.  

Radio-tracking studies should also be developed, so that more information could be 

gathered on species movements within this heterogeneous landscape, giving insight 

about species home-ranges and core areas, as well as about potential seasonal 

migrations of different species of bats.  

Lastly, studies about the ecosystem services provided by bats in this agricultural 

landscape should be performed, focusing on the effect insectivorous bats have in pest 

control, and on the consequent benefits obtained by land owners. Bat-boxes could be 

setup on some of the fields, thus promoting bat roosting and foraging activity in the 

surrounding areas, and total production compared to control crops. Additionally, 

production values should also be compared between crops under the influence of 

pesticides and control ones. By comparing total productions (or the losses due to insect 

herbivory), and the costs of bat-boxes versus pesticide use, both pest control service 

importance and its economic advantages could be assessed. However, monitoring the 

more specialized species would be essential, since bat boxes usually favour the most 

species that are known generalists.
