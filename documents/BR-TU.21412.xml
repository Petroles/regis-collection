RESUMO 

O corpo de minério Ingá foi descoberto em 2012 e é localizado na Unidade Serra 

Grande da AngloGold Ashanti, depósito de classe mundial no Distrito Aurífero de 

Crixás, Brasil central. Localizado nas rochas supracrustais, o corpo Ingá é dividido 

em Zona Superior e Zona Inferior. A Zona Superior contém lentes de sulfeto maciço 

hospedadas em dolomitos. A Zona Inferior foi sistematicamente estudada por DRX, 

FRX, ICP-MS, microssonda eletrônica e LA-ICP-MS. É controlada por uma falha de 

empurrão de baixo ângulo principal (Estrutura III) e suas litologias incluem, do topo 

para a base: dolomitos, filito carbonoso (GXN), veio de quartzo massivo (VQZ), 

quartzo-clorita-sericita-granada xisto e metagrauvaca com dois raros tipos de dique 

cortando a estratigrafia. Halos de alteração hidrotermal desenvolveram-se a partir da 

Estrutura III: silicificação, potássico, fílico e carbonático. A mineralização ocorre em 

três diferentes estágios. Três tipos de arsenopirita foram identificados: Aspy1 (cedo 

hidrotermal), Aspy2 (tardi hidrotermal, possivelmente rica em ouro invisível) e Aspy3 

(tardi hidrotermal, rica em ouro visível como inclusões, preenchendo fraturas ou ao 

longo de suas margens). Ouro visível também ocorre como cristais livres nos níveis 

basais do VQZ e na matriz do GXN. Possível remobilização de ouro invisível inferido 

em Aspy2 para formar ouro visível em Aspy3 ao longo de fraturas tardias e alteração 

seletiva em direção às margens dos cristais, ocorreu como consequência do 

dobramento F2, aumentando a quantidade de ouro passível de extração no corpo de 

minério. Os gráficos de Bi ppm x Se ppm e S % x Bi ppm e consideráveis ganhos de 

As, Ni e Co na zona de silicificação sobre GXN rico em arsenopirita, podem ser 

usados para identificar zonas potencialmente ricas em ouro. Quatro parâmetros 

prospectivos foram estabelecidos: VQZ, Aspy2 e Aspy3, falhas de acomodação e 

zona de silicificação.

ABSTRACT 

The Ingá orebody was discovered in 2012 and is located in the world-class 

AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande Unit of the Crixás Gold District, Central Brazil. 

Located in the supracrustal rocks, Ingá is divided into Upper and Lower Zones. The 

Upper Zone contains massive sulfide lenses hosted in dolomites. The Lower Zone 

was systematically studied by XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, EMP and LA-ICP-MS. It is 

controlled by a major low angle thrust fault (Structure III) and lithologies include, from 

top to bottom: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), 

quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, and metagraywacke with two types of rare 

cross-cutting dikes. Hydrothermal alteration haloes developed outwards from 

Structure III: silicification, potassic, phyllic and carbonatic. Mineralization occurs in 

three different stages. Three types of arsenopyrite were identified: Aspy1 (early 

hydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible gold-rich) and Aspy3 

(later hydrothermal, visible gold-rich as inclusions, filling fractures or along its 

margins). Visible gold also occurs as free crystals in the VQZ basal levels and in the 

GXN matrix. Possible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible 

gold in Aspy3 along late crystal fractures and selective alteration towards the margins 

occurred as consequence of F2 folding, increasing the orebody gold budget. The Bi 

ppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi ppm plots and major gains in As, Ni and Co in the 

arsenopyrite rich GXN silicification zone could be used to identify potentially gold rich 

zones. Four prospective parameters were established: VQZ, Aspy2 and Aspy3, 

accommodation faults, and silicification zone.

1. INTRODUÇÃO 

 

O distrito aurífero de Crixás constitui o quarto maior distrito de ouro atualmente 

em produção no Brasil. A região e seu potencial aurífero, explorada como garimpos 

desde o século XVIII pelos Bandeirantes, foi consolidada a partir da década de 1980 

com o estabelecimento da Mineração Serra Grande (mineração subterrânea 

mecanizada), posteriormente objeto de negociações empresariais e atualmente 

controlada totalmente pela empresa AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande. 

Nos últimos anos, programas de exploração mineral para ampliação de recursos 

e reservas resultaram no descobrimento de novos corpos mineralizados a ouro, 

como o corpo Ingá em 2012. Possuindo 0.59 MOz de ouro a um teor médio de 5.91 

g/t (31/12/2017), o corpo Ingá iniciou sua produção em 2017. A caracterização do 

corpo de minério Ingá está vinculada a projeto do grupo de trabalho da Universidade 

Federal do Rio Grande do Sul junto a AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande que 

objetiva investir na caracterização geológica e da alteração hidrotermal de corpos de 

minério descobertos recentemente no distrito aurífero de Crixás, como o corpo 

Palmeiras em 2006 (Almeida, 2006), Pequizão em 2011 (Sobiesiak, 2011) e 

Mangaba em 2018 (de Souza, em andamento). Além disso, o presente estudo visa 

contribuir no entendimento da gênese e configuração do corpo e sua mineralização 

aurífera, de modo a contribuir para futuras novas descobertas de corpos de minério 

no greenstone belt de Crixás.

1.3. ESTADO DA ARTE E CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO TEÓRICA 

 

1.3.1. Depósitos de ouro do tipo veio de quartzo-carbonato em greenstone 

belts 

 

De acordo com a classificação de Robert et al. (1997), há dezesseis tipos 

diferentes de depósitos de ouro, formados em diferentes ambientes geológicos e 

profundidades crustais. O depósito de ouro do tipo veio de quartzo-carbonato em 

greenstone belt é a classificação atribuída ao depósito e corpo de minério do 

presente estudo: Corpo Ingá, Mina de Serra Grande, greenstone belt de Crixás 

(Figura 1). Alguns outros exemplos no mundo são: Mt. Charlotte, Norseman, Victory 

(Australia), Giant, Contact Lake, San Antonio, Dome, Kerr Addison, Sigma-Lamaque 

(Canada), Mother Lode e Grass Valley (EUA). Este tipo de depósito é espacialmente 

associado a zonas de falhas expressivas em terrenos greenstone deformados, com 



10 
 

 

venulações mineralizadas associadas a zonas de cisalhamento dúcteis-rúpteis e 

localmente relacionados a falhas extensionais. 

 

 

Figura 1. Localização do município de Crixás e dependências da AngloGold Ashanti – Serra 

Grande. Modificado de Matsui (2002). 

 

A principal alteração hidrotermal associada a esse grupo de depósitos 

minerais é a carbonatação, sericitização e piritização, contendo assinatura 

geoquímica com a presença de elementos como Au, Ag, W, B, ± As, Mo, Bi, Pb, Sb, 

Te, W, Zn. Costumam formar depósitos de 1 a 10 milhões de toneladas de minério a 

5-10 g/t Au, contendo 25-100 toneladas de Au. Além disso, esse tipo de depósito 

possui idades entre Arqueano médio e Terciário (Groves et al., 2003), grau 

metamórfico entre xistos verdes inferior a granulito, com mineralização tardi-

tectônica a sin ou pós pico metamórfico, com temperatura e pressão de formação 

entre (200º-650ºC, 0.5-5 kbars) e fluídos de baixa salinidade (H2O-CO2 ± CH4 ± 

N2). Outros diagramas de classificação também foram elaborados por Groves et al. 

(1998), Hagemann e Cassidy (2000) e Bierlein e Crowe (2000). 

 

1.3.2. A Província Tocantins e os greenstone belts de Goiás 

 

A Província Tocantins (Almeida et al., 1977), localizada a oeste do Cráton São 

Francisco, engloba as faixas Araguaia, Brasília, Paraguai e Arco Magmático de 

Goiás e Maciço de Goiás. A região oriental da Província Tocantins foi subdividida 

(Fuck et al., 1993; Fuck, 1994) nos seguintes compartimentos tectônicos: Zona 



11 
 

 

Cratônica, Faixa Brasília – Zona Externa, Faixa Brasília – Zona Interna, Maciço de 

Goiás e Arco Magmático do Oeste de Goiás. A área de estudo situa-se no domínio 

do Maciço de Goiás (Figura 2). 

O Maciço de Goiás (Barbosa et al., 1969) é composto por terrenos granito-

greenstone belts de idade arqueana, complexos máficos-ultramáficos e sequências 

vulcano-sedimentares de idade paleo-mesoproterozoicas. As rochas de idade paleo-

mesoproterozoica consistem dos complexos máficos-ultramáficos de Barro Alto, 

Niquelândia e Canabrava além das sequências vulcano-sedimentares de Jucelândia, 

Coitezeiro e Palmeirópolis.  Em relação aos terrenos arqueanos no Maciço de Goiás 

(Figura 2), eles representam associações de complexos granito-gnáissicos e 

greenstone belts orientados NE-SW com limites inteiramente tectônicos. A norte e 

oeste estão limitados com o Arco Magmático de Goiás representado por rochas 

metavulcânicas, metassedimentares e gnáissicas de idade neoproterozóica. Ao sul e 

a nordeste estão limitados pela faixa de rochas metassedimentares e 

metavulcânicas do paleoproterozoico da região de Mossâmedes (Pimentel et al., 

2000). Ao leste e nordeste limitam-se com as rochas metassedimentares do grupo 

Araxá.

arqueanos do Brasil central. Modificado de Pimentel et al. (2000). 

  



12 
 

 

Os terrenos granito-gnáissicos compreendem cerca de 80% do segmento 

crustal arqueano e são constituídos de gnaisses e intrusões de granitóides de 

composição tonalítica a granodiorítica, raramente granítica. Esses terrenos foram 

reunidos em cinco complexos: Anta (Vargas, 1992), Caiamar (Jost et al., 1994a; 

Jost, 2001), Caiçara (Oliveira, 1983), Hidrolina e Uvá (Resende, 1999; Resende et 

al., 1998) e o bloco Moquém (Dani &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1978; Vargas, 1992; Jost et al., 

1994b). 

Os terrenos greenstone belts compreendem 20% do segmento crustal 

arqueano e são subdivididos em cinco faixas de 6 km de largura e 40 a 100 km de 

comprimento cada. As faixas de Crixás (Sabóia &amp;amp; Teixeira, 1980), Guarinos (Jost &amp;amp; 

Oliveira, 1991) e Pilar de Goiás (Jost &amp;amp; Oliveira, 1991) situam-se no extremo norte 

enquanto que as faixas de Faina (Resende et al., 1998) e Santa Rita (Resende et 

al., 1998) situam-se no extremo sul (Figura 2). Queiroz (2000) criou um quadro 

comparativo (Quadro I) da estratigrafia dos greenstone belts de Crixás, Guarinos, 

Pilar de Goiás, Santa Rita e Faina.

1.3.3. O greenstone belt de Crixás e seus depósitos auríferos 

 

O greenstone belt de Crixás (Figura 3) caracteriza-se como uma sequência 

vulcano-sedimentar, denominada Grupo Crixás por Jost e Oliveira (1991), alongada 

segundo a direção N-NW e S-SE, limitado ao sul e ao leste pelo Complexo Caiamar,

a oeste pelo Complexo Anta e a norte por rochas da Sequência Mina Inglesa e 

metassedimentos do neoproterozoico da Sequência Santa Terezinha (Jost, 2001; 

Dantas et al., 2001). Constitui uma faixa alongada com aproximadamente 45 km de 

comprimento e 6 km de largura (Pimentel et al., 2000). O Grupo Crixás foi 

caracterizado por Sabóia et al. (1981), da base para o topo, por rochas ultramáficas 

komatiíticas (Formação Córrego Alagadinho), basaltos almofadados e vesiculados 

(Formação Rio Vermelho) e por uma sequência de sedimentos químicos e detríticos 

no topo (Formação Ribeirão das Antas). As espessuras aproximadas são de 500m, 

350m e 700m, respectivamente. Theodoro (1995) subdividiu a Formação Ribeirão 

das Antas em Membro Vulcanossedimentar, Membro Carbonático e Membro 

Siliciclástico. 

 

 

Figura 3. a) Esquema geológico simplificado do greenstone belt de Crixás. Modificado de 

Jost e Fortes (2001). b) Coluna estratigráfica do greenstone belt de Crixás. Modificado de 

Jost et al. (2010). 

 

O greenstone belt de Crixás é caracterizado por grande complexidade 

estrutural como resultado de vários ciclos tecto-orogenéticos, sendo possível 

identificar uma fase de distensão durante a formação do greenstone belt, 

acompanhada de quatro eventos deformacionais posteriores, compressivos. A 

sequência de eventos compressivos, descrita por Massucato (2004) e Carvalho 

(2005), possui forte ligação com a mineralização aurífera. Carvalho (2005) 



14 
 

 

descreveu a existência de três eventos deformacionais (D1, D2 e D3) no greenstone 

belt de Crixás, assim como Massucato (2004), que levantou a hipótese de mais um 

evento (D4). Já Yamaoka e Araújo (1988) observaram a inversão estratigráfica das 

sequências na Mina III do greenstone belt de Crixás. 

O metamorfismo é heterogêneo, assim como a deformação, desde condições 

de xisto verde até a fácies anfibolito inferior (Massucatto, 2004). O modelo 

epigenético, atribuído aos depósitos de ouro da região de Crixás, mostra-se 

consistente com as interpretações de depósitos de ouro de terrenos arqueanos 

(Jost, 2001), definidas por Phillips e Groves (1983) e aprimoradas por Foster et al. 

(1986), Groves et al. (1987), Colvine et al. (1988), Colvine (1989) e Groves e Foster 

(1991). 

Os dados mais recentes de datação geocronológica (Jost et al., 2010) têm 

apontado que a mineralização aurífera é restrita ao Rhyaciano (Paleoproterozoico), 

através de datação de zircões magmáticos de diques máficos pós-mineralização que 

indicaram idade U-Pb de 2170 ± 17 Ma (Jost et al., 2010). Jost et al. (2010) também 

sugere que o estágio basinal, deformação, metamorfismo e mineralização ocorreram 

em um intervalo de tempo de 30-40 Ma restrito ao mesmo período (2,2 a 2,17 Ma). 

O mesmo trabalho ainda sugere que a carga sedimentar da área fonte para as 

metagrauvacas e filitos carbonosos da Formação Córrego Alagadinho possui idade 

(U-Pb de 3354 ± 40 Ma a 2209 ± 28 Ma) entre o arqueano e o paleoprotezoico 

(Rhyaciano) com idade deposicional máxima de 2,2 Ga. A idade dos metabasaltos 

da Fm. Rio Vermelho e metakomatiitos da Fm. Córrego Alagadinho são sugeridas 

como arqueanas por Arndt et al. (1989) e Fortes et al. (2003), mas Jost et al. (2010) 

indicou idade paleoproterozoica (idades modelo Nd 2,32 Ga e 2,24 Ga). 

No greenstone belt de Crixás encontram-se as principais mineralizações 

auríferas da região (Tabela 1 e Figura 4), controladas por falhas transcorrentes e de 

empurrão (Jost &amp;amp; Fortes 2001), de modo que três tipos diferentes de mineralização 

foram reconhecidos: (1) Sulfeto maciço, (2) Veio de quartzo e (3) Sulfeto 

disseminado. Os corpos de minério podem ser divididos de acordo com a falha de 

empurrão principal que o controla, chamada de “estrutura”: Estrutura Palmeiras 

(corpos Palmeiras e Baru), Estrutura IV (corpos Pequizão, Forquilha, Corpo IV, 

Corpo V e Sucupira), Zona Superior (Mina III e Ingá) e Estrutura III (Mina III, Mina 

Nova e Ingá).

1.3.4. A estrutura III e o corpo de minério Ingá 

 

Na chamada “Estrutura III”, ocorrem os corpos de minério Mina III, Mina Nova e 

Ingá. Yamaoka e Araújo (1988) dividiram o corpo de minério Mina III em quatro 

zonas: superior, intermediária, inferior e zona da granada. Na zona superior a 

mineralização ocorre na forma de lentes de sulfeto maciço hospedados em mármore 

dolomítico, quartzo-clorita-carbonato-sericita xistos, pirrotita-magnetita-biotita xistos, 

clorita-granada xistos, granaditos, muscovita xistos, muscovita-clorita xistos e biotita 

mármores (Jost &amp;amp; Fortes 2001). O ouro ocorre em associação com arsenopirita, 

pirrotita, calcopirita, carbonatos, quartzo, micas e óxidos. Na zona intermediária 

ocorre a zona da granada associada, além de um veio de quartzo concordante 

hospedado em quartzo-clorita-muscovita-granada xisto. O ouro ocorre em 

associação com quartzo, micas, arsenopirita, calcopirita e óxidos. A zona inferior da 

Mina III, similar à zona inferior do corpo de minério Ingá, possui veio de quartzo 

encaixado em filito carbonoso com arsenopirita e pirrotita disseminadas próximas ao 

veio (Jost &amp;amp; Fortes 2001). O ouro associa-se com quartzo, material carbonoso e 

arsenopirita. As rochas hospedeiras apresentam alteração hidrotermal do tipo 

silicificação, carbonatação, fílica e sulfetação e encontram-se deformadas e 

metamorfisadas na fácies epidoto-anfibolito (Fortes et al. 1997). 



16 
 

 

O corpo de minério Mina Nova está hospedado em filitos carbonosos 

deformados por cisalhamento e compreende três tipos de minério (Portocarrero, 

1996): Tipo I, Tipo II, Tipo III. O tipo I consiste de filito carbonoso com disseminações 

de pirrotita, arsenopirita e calcopirita. O tipo II consiste de sericita carbonato xisto 

com arsenopirita, pirrotita e calcopirita e o tipo III possui arsenopirita disseminada 

em venulações de quartzo hospedadas em filito carbonoso. Além disso, a Mina Nova 

também apresenta as seguintes litologias: anfibólio xistos, mármores, quartzo-

clorita-carbonato-sericita xistos, quartzo-clorita-sericita-granada xistos e xistos 

feldspáticos. A mineralização do tipo minério disseminado é a principal forma de 

ocorrência do ouro no corpo de minério Mina Nova.  

O corpo de minério Ingá possui mergulho da mineralização para NW, 

contendo subcorpos com espessuras que variam de 1 a 3 metros e comprimento 

entre 350 e 900 metros ao longo do mergulho (Silva, 2014). O corpo Ingá é dividido 

em duas zonas mineralizadas distintas: Superior e Inferior. Na Zona Superior a 

mineralização ocorre na forma de lentes de sulfeto maciço hospedado em dolomitos 

e na Zona Inferior, objeto de estudo deste trabalho, a mineralização aurífera ocorre 

associada a um espesso veio de quartzo e ao filito carbonoso adjacente ao veio. A 

zona inferior do corpo de minério Ingá foi estudada em detalhe anteriormente pelo 

presente autor (Castoldi, 2015), cujos dados também são apresentados na presente 

dissertação e manuscrito submetido a periódico.

Abstract 

The Ingá orebody was discovered in 2012 and is located in the world-class AngloGold Ashanti – Serra 

Grande Unit of the Crixás Gold District, Central Brazil. Located in the supracrustal rocks, Ingá is 

divided into Upper and Lower Zones. The Upper Zone contains massive sulfide lenses hosted in 

dolomites. The Lower Zone was systematically studied by XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, EMP and LA-ICP-

MS. It is controlled by a major low angle thrust fault (Structure III) and lithologies include, from top 

to bottom: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), quartz-chlorite-sericite-

garnet schist, and metagraywacke with two types of rare cross-cutting dikes. Hydrothermal alteration 

haloes developed outwards from Structure III: silicification, potassic, phyllic and carbonatic. 

Mineralization occurs in three different stages. Three types of arsenopyrite were identified: Aspy1 

(early hydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible gold-rich) and Aspy3 (later 

hydrothermal, visible gold-rich as inclusions, filling fractures or along its margins). Visible gold also 

occurs as free crystals in the VQZ basal levels and in the GXN matrix. Possible remobilization of 

inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 along late crystal fractures and selective 

alteration towards the margins occurred as consequence of F2 folding, increasing the orebody gold 

budget. The Bi ppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi ppm plots and major gains in As, Ni and Co in the 

arsenopyrite rich GXN silicification zone could be used to identify potentially gold rich zones. Four 

prospective parameters were established: VQZ, Aspy2 and Aspy3, accommodation faults, and 

silicification zone.

Introduction 

Correctly understanding mineral occurrence controls is a major concern for brownfields and 

greenfields exploration efforts worldwide. In the Crixás greenstone belt terrane (18.73 Moz Au), in the 

Goiás Massif (southern portion of Tocantins Province), gold orebodies are stacked in a 

metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary stratigraphic sequence. The three types of gold mineralization 

present in the world-class Crixás Gold District (quartz-vein, disseminated, and massive sulfide) have 

key microscale characteristics that have to be considered in exploration efforts: arsenopyrite with or 

without visible gold inclusions (with possible remobilization) and visible/invisible gold within bands 



19 
 

 

of the major quartz veins. Analytical interpretation at the microscale must then be completed to 

develop reliable macroscale prospective parameters for exploration teams. 

World-class AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande Unit in the Crixás Gold District, part of the 

Crixás greenstone belt terrane, is the fourth largest gold deposit currently in operation in Brazil in 

regard to production. More than 23.2 Mt of ore at 5.97 g/t Au (4.19 Moz of Au) have already been 

extracted from the beginning of its production in 1986 to 2017. Reserves and global resources as of 

December 31th, 2017 were 6.68 Moz Au from more than 50.67 Mt at an average grade of 4.10 g/t Au. 

The gold distribution at the Crixás Gold District is controlled by thrust faults and spatially organized 

in many different orebodies. The Ingá orebody is divided into Upper and Lower Zones and contains 

0.59 Moz Au from more than 3.14 Mt at an average grade of 5.91 g/t Au, as of December 31th, 2017. 

The present study focuses on the Lower Zone of the orebody. Ingá orebody is an important segment of 

the Crixás Gold District and its study presents an opportunity to contribute to exploration in the area. 

Mapping, petrography, and whole rock analysis of wall rocks and hydrothermal zones provide 

the geochemical signature for major and trace elements within orebodies (Barrett et al., 1998; Dube et 

al., 2007; Wilkinson et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2016; Lebrun et al., 2017). Furthermore, X-ray 

diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron microprobe (EMP) are used 

extensively to identify hydrothermal alteration haloes and minerals (e.g. Dube et al., 2007; Duuring et 

al., 2016; Lebrun et al., 2017). Backscattering imaging (BSE) in SEM, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS element 

mapping in Au bearing arsenopyrite may reveal crystal element zoning and gold remobilization (Large 

et al., 2007, 2009; Morey et al., 2008; Ciobanu et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2013; Hazarika et al., 2013; 

Lawley et al., 2015; Steadman and Large, 2016; Rottier et al., 2016). Through mapping, hand and drill 

hole sampling, petrographic microscope, XRD, whole rock geochemical analysis, SEM, EMP, LA-

ICP-MS, and modelling, the main objectives of this paper are: (1) petrographic and geochemical 

characterization of the host rocks, hydrothermal alteration haloes and mineralization; (2) geochemical 

explanation of the arsenopyrite-gold bearing association; (3) explain the genesis of the Ingá orebody; 

(4) explain the concentration of gold in the major quartz vein; (5) establish prospective parameters for 

the industry. 

Geologic Setting 

Regional Geology 

The Crixás Gold District (lat 14º34’25” S, long 49°58’04” W), in the Crixás greenstone belt 

terrane, is located in the Goiás Massif (Fig. 1A), in the southern portion of the Tocantins Province 

(Almeida et al., 1977; Fuck et al. 1993; Fuck, 1994), which is composed of archean-paleoproterozoic 

granite-gneiss and greenstone belt terranes, mafic-ultramafic complexes, and volcano-sedimentary 

sequences (Barbosa et al., 1969; Pimentel et al., 2000). The greenstone belts terrains are divided into 

five sub-terrains (Fig. 1B) of 6 km width and 40 to 100 km length: Crixás (Sabóia and Teixeira, 1980), 



20 
 

 

Guarinos, and Pilar de Goiás (Jost and Oliveira, 1991) to the north and Faina and Santa Rita to the 

south (Resende et al., 1998). 

The Crixás greenstone belt is a volcano-sedimentary sequence (Jost and Oliveira, 1991) 

elongated in the N-NW and S-SE directions with 6 km width and 45 km in length and are composed, 

from base to top, (Sabóia et al., 1981) by: komatiitic ultramafic rocks (Córrego Alagadinho 

Formation), vesiculated and pillowed basalts (Rio Vermelho Formation) and a sequence of detritical 

and chemical sediments (Ribeirão das Antas Formation). The average thicknesses are 500 m, 350 m, 

and 700 m, respectively. The Ribeirão das Antas formation is subdivided into a volcano-sedimentary 

member, carbonatic member, and siliciclastic member (Theodoro et al., 1995). Structural complexity 

in the greenstone is inferrered to be the result of an extensional phase during its formation, followed 

by later compressive deformation (Carvalho, 2005). The Crixás greenstone belt is limited by two 

TTGs complexes: the Caiamar to the south and east, and the Anta to the west, and by the 

metasedimentary sequences of Mina Inglesa and Santa Terezinha to the north.

The installation of the Crixás greenstone belt started with komatiite followed by toleiitic spills 

originating a flexural basin with deposition of carbonaceous phyllite and metagraywacke, 

characterizing a proximal shallow sea platform setting. The Córrego Alagadinho Formation is 



22 
 

 

composed of metakomatiites with spinifex texture, olivine cumulates, flux breccia, polyhedral 

disjunctions, and partial or total serpentinization (Sabóia 1979). The Rio Vermelho Formation is in 

abrupt contact with the Córrego Alagadinho Formation and has toleitic basalts, amphibolites, 

amphibole schists, and komatiitic metabasalts with primary features including: pillows, varioles, 

vesicles and orbicules locally preserved (Sabóia 1979). Banded iron formations, magnesiferous 

formations, and metachert occur as metasedimentary intercalations (Jost and Fortes 2001). The 

Ribeirão das Antas Formation occurs in transitional contact with the Rio Vermelho Formation and is 

composed of carbonaceous phyllite with lenses and beds of dolomites superimposed abruptly by 

siliciclastic metarritimites. Theodoro (1995) divided the Ribeirão das Antas Formation into three 

members: (1) volcano-sedimentary; (2) carbonatic; (3) siliciclastic. 

Structural data obtained by Magalhães (1991), Queiroz (1995), and referred to in unpublished 

reports by the staff of the mining company attest that the supracrustal rocks of Crixás underwent four 

major deformational events: D1, D2, D3, and D4. An east-west compression with vergence to the east 

followed and formed a N-S low-angle thrust fault system, with geometry similar to a duplex. D1 is 

responsible for the formation of regional, tight to isoclinal, probably upright folds with an axial 

surface represented by a metamorphic foliation (S1) that is pervasive in the metasedimentary 

sequence. Thrust faults generated metric ruptile-ductile shear zones in which the hydrothermal fluids 

took advantage as preferential pathways. The main hydrothermal event occurred during D1 (syn-

mineralization). Hydrothermal activity formed the major quartz-vein mineralization type observed in 

the Structure III Lower Zone orebodies, including Ingá.  

The D2 event is N-S compressive, promoting the horsening of the Santa Teresinha Sequence 

above the Crixás group rocks (stratigraphic overturning), which generated F2 folds, S2 plan-axial 

cleavage, and L2 stretching lineation. Metakomatiites override metabasalts which are overridden by 

the metasedimentary section, during stratigraphic overturning in D2. Thin-skinned thrusting developed 

a steep ramp to the west and a duplex to the east. The gold mineralization and associated hydrothermal 

alteration haloes are hosted within the duplex, which indicates that it corresponds to several stacked 

dilation zones interpreted as second-order thrust faults related to a major, shallowly dipping, first-

order detachment fault (Jost et al., 2010). The F2 folds, in general, structurally control the 

mineralization plunge in the district because of D2 compression on S1 foliation, which possibly 

promotes remobilization. Mineralization plunge is usually parallel to F2 fold axis. These folds are 

recumbent to semi-recumbent, dominantly south-vergent with south westerly dips and a weakly to 

moderately developed axial plane foliation. L2 stretching lineations that formed by intersection of S2 

with S1 planes also mark the mineralization plunge. Thrust faulting due to F2 can be generated, being 

the cause for local gold remobilization. 

The D3 event involved an E-W compression, which resulted in large scale N-S folding, 

promoting the formation of post-mineralization crenulation cleavage (S3). The D3 event formed the 



23 
 

 

Rio Vermelho Antiform (Magalhães, 1991), folding the duplex system that formed during D1 

(Carvalho, 2005). Neoproterozoic Mara Rosa Magmatic Arc rocks override the northern limit of the 

greenstone belt. Minor structures of this event comprise SW-verging, semi-recumbent to recumbent 

folds. The D3 event is also responsible for gold remobilization and reshaping of the orebodies to an 

overall 25º/N65ºW plunge, as well as for partial recrystallization of the hydrothermal alteration 

envelopes of some of the orebodies (Jost et al., 2010). The post-mineralization D4 event was NNW-

SSE to N-S compressive, forming kink bands, smooth folding, and crenulation cleavage (S4), without 

influencing the orebody geometry and gold distribution. Metamorphism of the rocks ranges from 

greenschist to lower amphibolite facies (Jost et al., 2010). The Crixás Gold District then comprises a 

thrust stack of seven or more major thrust sheets, separated by either discrete thrust planes or (more 

commonly), complex thrust zones comprising both locally imbricated thrusts and/or high strain zones 

including several primary and altered lithologies (L.R. Rankin, pers. commun., 2004). 



24 
 

 

 



25 
 

 

Geochronological data suggest that gold mineralization is restricted to the Rhyacian 

(Paleoproterozoic). Magmatic zircons from post-mineralization mafic dikes dated by U-Pb indicate 

2170 ± 17 Ma (Jost et al., 2010). The basinal stage, deformation, metamorphism, and mineralization, 

according to Jost et al. (2010), occurred in a 30-40 Ma range of time restricted to the Rhyacian 2.2 to 

2.17 Ma. The source sediments that were metamorphosed to carbonaceous phyllite and 

metagraywacke have U-Pb dating of 3354 ± 40 Ma to 2209 ± 28 Ma, with a maximum depositional 

age of 2.2 Ga. The model ages of metabasalts of the Rio Vermelho Formation and metakomatiites of 

the Córrego Alagadinho Formation are Nd 2.32 Ga and 2.24 Ga, respectively (Jost et al., 2010; Fortes 

et al., 2003). 

Deposit Geology 

The main auriferous mineralizations of the region occur in the Crixás greenstone belt and are 

controlled by thrust and transcurrent faults (Jost and Fortes, 2001). The area is within the AngloGold 

Ashanti - Serra Grande Unit and the Cleveland Mining Company LTD - Premier Gold Project (Fig. 

1E). Three different types of gold mineralization are known: (1) Massive sulfide; (2) Quartz-vein; (3) 

Disseminated sulfide (Table 2).  

The massive type consists of lenses of massive sulfide concordant with S1 parallel to S2 and 

occurring near the contact between metabasalts and BIF of Rio Vermelho Formation or inside the 

dolomite layers crosscutting the stratigraphic sequence (Fortes, 1996). These lenses have 95% Po-

Aspy, with subordinated magnetite, ilmenite, and chalcopyrite and are 0.5–2.5 m in width and 50-400 

m in length. The gold occurs in the massive Aspy crystals.

Chlorite Schist; VQZ = Quartz Vein. Lenses of the above lithologies may crosscut the sequences in different levels with variable thickness. 

The quartz-vein type is discontinuous and concordant with the S1 parallel to S2, having 0.5-

5.0 m width and 500-1500 m length. It occurs in the carbonaceous phyllite of the Ribeirão das Antas 

Formation. and has 98% recrystallized milk-quartz with disseminationed Po, Aspy, Mca, 

carbonaceous matter, plagioclase, carbonate, and chlorite. The gold occurs as free crystals in the 

quartz vein, with the highest concentrations occurring up to 1.5 m from the footwall of the vein, 

inwards. The disseminated sulfide mineralization type consists of zones with 1-5 m in width and 200-

1000 m in length, in the Ribeirão das Antas Formation carbonaceous phyllite. The gold occurs in the 

carbonaceous phyllite Aspy, as free crystals in quartz-veining, or in the carbonaceous phyllite gangue 

minerals (i.e. titanite and biotite). Other sulfide minerals are Cpy, Py, Po, and Pentlandite. The 

orebodies at the Crixás Gold District are classified according to the main thrust fault that controls 

them, named “structures”, which included, stacked from top to bottom (Table 2 and Fig. 2): Structure 

Palmeiras (Palmeiras and Baru orebodies), Structure IV (Pequizão, Forquilha, Corpo IV, Corpo V, and 



27 
 

 

Sucupira orebodies), Structure III Upper Zone (Mina III and Ingá orebodies) and Structure III Lower 

Zone (Mina III, Mina Nova, and Ingá orebodies). 

The present study focus on the quartz-vein and disseminated mineralization in the Ingá 

orebody Lower Zone (Structure III). The Mina III Lower Zone and Mina Nova orebodies are hosted at 

the same stratigraphic level as the Ingá orebody Lower Zone in the Ribeirão das Antas Formation, 

showing similarities between them. This stratigraphic level has the highest gold grades in the district. 

The Mina III started production in 1986 and is the richest orebody in the region, with 1,0 Moz Au 

from more than 6,86 Mt at an average grade of 4.53 g/t Au as of December 31th, 2017. Yamaoka and 

Araújo (1988) divided the Mina III orebody into four zones: upper, intermediate, lower, and garnet 

zone. The Mina III Lower Zone has major quartz-veins crosscutting carbonaceous phyllite, with 

arsenopyrite and pyrite disseminated close to the vein (Jost and Fortes, 2001). Gold crystals are 

associated with quartz, carbonaceous matter, and arsenopyrite. The host rocks present carbonate, 

sericite, silicification, and sulfide haloes and are metamorphosed and deformed in the epidote-

amphibolite facies (Fortes et al., 1997). The Mina Nova has 0.34 Moz Au from more than 6.52 Mt at 

an average grade of 3.26 g/t Au as of December 31, 2017. The orebody is hosted in carbonaceous 

phyllite and its mineralization includes: Po, Aspy, and Cpy disseminated in carbonaceous phyllite; 

Aspy, Po, and Cpy disseminated in sericite-carbonate schist; Aspy disseminated in quartz-veins 

crosscutting carbonaceous phyllite (Portocarrero, 1996). 

 The Ingá orebody is divided into Upper and Lower Zones regarding mineralization style. In 

the Upper Zone the mineralization occurs as massive sulfide lenses hosted in dolomites. In the Lower 

Zone, the object of this study, the mineralization occurs in association with a thick, discontinuous 

quartz vein and adjacent carbonaceous phyllite, associated with arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, and 

subordinated pyrite. The Lower Zone comprises the following host rocks, from top to bottom: 

brecciated dolomitic marbles, carbonaceous phyllite, quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, and 

metagraywackes. Hydrothermal alteration over carbonaceous phyllite adjacent to the thick quartz vein 

consists of: silicification, phyllic (muscovite) and carbonatic alteration outwards with pods of potassic 

alteration (biotite). No previous publications and few company reports are available for the Ingá 

orebody. 

Sampling and Analytical Methods 

The present contribution reports the study conducted between 2015 and 2018, with data 

collected in AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande Unit and the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do 

Sul (UFRGS). Two hundred and eighty meters of four drill holes selected in a 203-023° section 

perpendicular to the Ingá orebody plunge were geologically described and eighty-two drill core 

samples were collected. Other fifty-one drill core samples from thirty five drill holes were collected in 

a 250 x 250 x 250 m grid through the Ingá orebody. Twenty-two hand samples were collected during 

underground mapping of 112 meters of the Ingá orebody´s 730N galleries with a 1:100 scale and 3 m 



28 
 

 

high projection. From the samples collected, sixty-one were selected for petrographic description of 

polished thin sections under a LEICA DM LP microscope. The sampling approach prioritized different 

lithotypes, hydrothermal alteration, gold grades, deformation, visual percentage of sulfides and/or 

visible gold. The drill core described in the study are totally assayed by 30g gold fire assay analysis 

done on 0.8 – 1.2m samples by AngloGold Ashanti – Serra Grande Unit industrial laboratory, with 

lower detection limit of 0.025 ppm. Samples for whole-rock analysis were also analyzed by ALS 

Minerals 30g fire assay with detection limit of 0.005 ppm. Leapfrog Geo 4.2, Reflex IoGAS 6.3.1, 

ArcGIS 10.1, and Datamine Studio 3 softwares were used for data analysis and modelling. 

XRD and Whole-rock Analysis 

Twenty samples from a vertical section of drill holes XIGE-0066 and XIGE-0023 were 

analyzed with XRD. Ten samples were analyzed for whole-rock and clay identification in Weatherford 

Laboratories (SIEMENS BRUKER AXS D4 Endeavor) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with softwares MDI 

Jade 9+ 2009 and PDF 4+ 2010. Ten samples were analyzed for clay identification in the 

Diffractometry Laboratory at UFRGS (SIEMENS BRUKER AXS DS5000) in Porto Alegre, Brazil 

with softwares DIFFRAC – PLUS-EVA and NEWMOD. The database utilized was the ICDD JCPDS. 

Scanning patterns for whole rock and clay analysis were Cu K? (0,15406 nm), K? 2 (0,1544390 nm), 

40 Kv, 40 mA, goniometer diameter of 402 mm and variable divergent gap of  1,5 mm for whole rock 

and 0,75 mm for clay.  

Sixty-one samples from thirty-nine drill holes were analyzed for whole rock major and trace 

element characterization. Fifty-one samples are spaced in a 250 x 250 x 250 grid and ten samples are 

in a vertical section of four drill holes - both sample sets located through the Ingá orebody. The 

sampling approach focused on the carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist 

lithologies with background, low, and high gold grades. Analyses were conducted by ALS Minerals in 

Goiânia and Vespasiano, Brazil (physical preparation) and Lima, Peru (chemical analysis). The 

physical preparation consisted of weighing, splitting, milling, pulverization to 70% less than 2 mm, 

splitting, and pulverization to 80% less than 75 µm. The chemical analysis consisted of whole rock 

analysis by fusion/x-ray fluorescence (XRF), loss on ignition by XRF-WST-SEQ, inductively coupled 

plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), total carbon and sulfur measurements by LECO, lithium 

borate fusion with ICP-MS and four acid digestion of base metals with inductively coupled plasma – 

atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 

SEM and EMP Analysis 

Twelve thin sections were analyzed by the SEM facility in the UFRGS Isotopic Geology 

Laboratory equipped with a JEOL JSM-6610LV with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) Bruker 

133 eV. The focus was the characterization of mineral phases, spot analysis and compositional 

mapping with semi-quantitative EDS, and textural analysis of gold crystals and sulfides by BSE 



29 
 

 

imaging. Five thin sections were analyzed for spot, line sections and element mapping with 

wavelength dispersion spectrometry (WDS) using EMP. Two thin sections had garnet, biotite and 

chlorite crystals analyzed at the UFRGS Electron Microprobe Laboratory equipped with a Cameca 

SXFive EMP with operation conditions of 15 keV, 20 nA, 1 µm for garnet, and 15 keV, 15 nA, 10 µm 

for biotite and chlorite. Four thin sections had arsenopyrite, biotite, muscovite and chlorite crystals 

analyzed at the Queen’s University EMP Laboratory equipped with a JEOL JXA-8230 EMP with 

operation conditions of 20 keV, 50 nA, and focused beam for arsenopyrite, and 15 keV, 10 nA, and 7 

µm for biotite, muscovite and chlorite. 

LA-ICP-MS Analysis 

One thin section was selected for chemical arsenopyrite analysis by LA-ICP-MS.  Three 

element mapping zones and eighteen spot analyses were obtained on arsenopyrite crystals considering 

its core, margins, and fractures. Analyses were performed at Queen’s University using a 193 nm ArF 

Excimer laser (Elemental Scientific Lasers NWR193) interfaced with a Thermo Scientific X-Series 2 

Quadrupole ICPMS using He as a carrier gas. Laser diameter was set to 10 µm with a scan speed of 5 

µm/s and a repetition rate of 30 Hz to ensure the best possible resolution for the maps. Ar (sample gas) 

and He (carrier gas) flows were optimised on a daily basis for best sensitivity (~10e5 counts/s on 

238U for NIST 612 reference glass) while keeping the oxide level as low as possible (&lt;1%). Gas 

blanks were measured before and after each line for a minimum of 20 seconds. A typical measurement 

sequence consisted of a block of NIST 614, 612, and 610 reference glasses used to generate individual 

linear calibrations for all elements, followed by certified reference basalt glass BCR-2G (USGS), the 

goal of which was to both validate the calibration generated by the NIST glasses and to extend the 

calibration for elements such as Fe or S (NIST glasses having very similar Fe and S contents). 

Sulphide pellet reference MASS-1 was run at the end of each set of calibrations to readjust the 

calibration generated on silicate reference glasses, in order to matrix match the samples. NIST glasses 

as well as BCR-2G and MASS-1 were run at regular time intervals during the sequences. At the end of 

each sequence, another complete set of calibrations were generated. Data reduction was performed on 

Iolite v3.63. The data reduction routine consisted of a gas blank subtraction for each individual line, as 

well as interpolation between calibrations to correct for any potential drift during the sequence (i.e. 

instrumental drift of the ICPMS, small variations in laser output, etc). Results files generated on the 

ICPMS were then combined with the laser logs to generate maps. 

Results 

Host Rocks and Hydrothermal Alteration 

The host rocks at Ingá orebody Lower Zone are metamorphic assemblages with superimposed 

hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 3). Petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, SEM, and XRD were used to 

characterize alteration in terms of mineralogical assemblages and geochemistry. The host rock 



30 
 

 

stratigraphy is, from top-down: dolomite, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), 

quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist (GNCX), and metagraywacke (Fig. 1D, Fig. 4A-B). Rare dikes of 

biotite-chlorite schist (BCS) and quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) crosscut the sequence. A mafic 

dike is suggested as protolith for both dikes, which is intensely hydrothermally altered and with its 

matrix substituted. Lenses of GNCX inside carbonaceous phyllite and lenses of dolomite inside 

GNCX and carbonaceous phyllite are rare.

Abbreviations: GNCX = Quartz-Chlorite-Sericite-Garnet Schist; GXN = Carbonaceous Schist. 

The dolomite is &gt; 9.4m thick and has a gradual-diffuse lower contact with the carbonaceous 

phyllite and a diffuse upper contact with the metabasalt or quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist. 

Three types of dolomite are identified based on texture: massive (Fig. 4C), brecciated (Fig. 4G), and 

laminated (Fig. 4H). The massive dolomite has uniform rounded carbonate-quartz-feldspar crystals, 

while the brecciated dolomite has large allotriomorphic carbonate-quartz-feldspar crystals, with 

quartz-plagioclase being more abundant. The laminated dolomite contain fine carbonate-quartz-



31 
 

 

feldspar crystals oriented along S1 parallel to S2. The dolomite color varies from light gray to white, 

with green pockets mm to &amp;lt;8 cm in thickness related to a high concentration of chlorite-biotite. It 

contains centimetric to decimetric carbonaceous phyllite lenses where quartz-carbonate millimeter-

scale venulations may occur. Due to folding of the sequence, dolomite lenses occur in the GNCX. 

Mineral assemblage shows that dolomite and ankerite comprise 88 vol%, quartz 4 vol%, feldspar 2 

vol%, biotite 2 vol%, pyrrothite 1.5 vol%, illite/muscovite/kaolinite 1 vol%, plagioclase &amp;lt;1 vol%, 

zircon and titanite &amp;lt;1 vol%, chalcopyrite &amp;lt;1 vol%, and roscoelite &amp;lt;1 vol%.

The biotite-chlorite schist (BCS) dike is &amp;lt;2.54 m thick and has a diffuse upper contact with 

dolomite and an abrupt lower contact with the carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4D). The BCS dike color is 

dark green due to intense chloritization. Quartz-carbonate venulations and pockets, and punctuations 

of biotite and sericite are common. Mineral assemblage show quartz 38 vol%, chlorite 25 vol%, 

feldspar 19 vol%, biotite 10 vol%, carbonate 3 vol%, carbonaceous matter 3 vol%, sericite 1 vol%, 

plagioclase &amp;lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &amp;lt;1 vol%, and magnetite &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

The quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) dike is &amp;lt;1.53 m thick and has abrupt lower and 

upper contact with carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4E). The QGSS color is greenish dark gray punctuated 

by light gray garnet crystals. Quartz-carbonate sub-mm to mm venulations are common. Mineral 

assemblage show quartz 20 vol%, white mica 28 vol%, garnet 13 vol%, carbonaceous matter 13 vol%, 

biotite 10 vol%, feldspar 5 vol%, ilmenite 3 vol%, hornblende 2 vol%, pyrrhotite &amp;lt;1-4 vol%, 

chalcopyrite 1 vol%, carbonate &amp;lt;1 vol%, chlorite &amp;lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 vol%, magnetite and 

pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

The major quartz-vein is 0.14 to 2.49 m thick and has abrupt upper and lower contact with 

carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4J). It generally crosscuts the carbonaceous phyllite near its lower contact 

with GNCX. It is mainly milky and commonly folded, with scarce glassy or smoky textured portions 

that are discontinuous. This vein commonly contains intensely foliated carbonaceous phyllite slivers, 

with irregular shapes, chlorite, and tourmaline (Fig. 4I). Centimetric irregular carbonate venulations 

are common. The VQZ is the main feature of the thrust structure III, parallel to oblique to it, and 

represents the main mining target of the Ingá orebody Lower Zone. The major quartz vein represents a 

set of crack and seal veining formed due to permeability anisotropy within the carbonaceous schist. It 

can be also classified as fault-fill veining according to Robert and Poulsen (2001). 

The central part of the VQZ represents the merging and juxtaposition of numerous quartz 

veinlets. On its vertical terminations, the VQZ grades into metric-decimetric sheeted veinlet zone to 

centimentric isolated veinlets. Late steeply dipping, centimetric-decimetric quartz veins, with 

carbonaceous material and minimal wall rock displacement suggests emplacement along a tension 

fracture within the major quartz vein. Mesoscopically, the quartz is mainly laminated, commonly 

separated by slip surfaces enhanced by the presence of chlorite and tourmaline. Striations are present 

in these slip surfaces and are sub-parallel to the elongation lineation in the foliated carbonaceous 

phyllite. The individual laminae are parallel to subparallel to the vein margins. The free gold related to 

VQZ concentrates up to 0.9 m inwards from the footwall contact with the carbonaceous phyllite. In the 

carbonaceous phyllite slivers inside VQZ, commonly occurs two generations of arsenopyrite, in which 

the later contains gold as inclusions, filling fractures or in its margins. With increased F2 folding, gold 

grades become progressively higher towards F2 fold axis. The mineral assemblage is composed by 

quartz 95-97 vol%, chlorite 2 vol%, carbonate 1%, carbonaceous matter &amp;lt;1 to 1 vol%, white mica &amp;lt;1 

to 1 vol%, biotite &amp;lt;1 vol%, tourmaline &amp;lt;1 vol%, and gold 0 to &amp;lt;1 vol%.

The metagraywacke is &gt; 13.73 m thick and has a diffuse and interdigitated upper contact with 

the GNCX (Fig. 4N). Its lower contact is unknown since no drill hole has ever crossed another 

lithology below the metagraywacke in the Ingá orebody due to drill hole depths and the lack of 

economic gold concentrations within the metagraywacke in this region. The metagraywacke is dark 

gray in color. Interdigitated lenses of GNCX are present and common with a 0.5 to &amp;lt;5 cm size-range. 

The original rhythmic layering of the graywacke is preserved, with graded bedding, cross-lamination, 

cut and fill, and local intraformational breccias with irregular clasts of carbonaceous phyllite. Rare 

quartz-carbonate millimetric venulations occur. Mineral assemblage shows almost equal proportions 

of quartz, biotite and albite, oligoclase or andesine, locally muscovite, with minor zircon, magnetite, 

ilmenite, rutile and apatite, as well as millimetric sized rock fragments with quartz, plagioclase and 

biotite. 

Hydrothermal Alteration Assemblage 

 The hydrothermal alteration zoning is characterized by four main haloes and 

respective assemblages that affect the carbonaceous phyllite and the quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet 

schist (GNCX), in the following sequence: Carbonatic, Phyllic, Potassic, and Silicification haloes (Fig. 

3, Table 3A and 3B). The haloes together sum 36 to 83 meters thick in the drill holes studied.

chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, Qz = quartz, Rt = rutile. 

 The carbonatic halo affects the carbonaceous phyllite pervasively with thicknesses of 1.2 to 

17.6 meters, which decrease progressively along the Ingá orebody plunge, reflecting the decrease in 

thickness of the adjacent dolomite up the stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 5A). It presents a diffuse gradual 

upper contact with the dolomites and a diffuse gradual lower contact with the phyllic zone 

carbonaceous phyllite. Carbonates in this halo were identified by SEM and XRD as mainly dolomite, 

with subordinated ankerite and calcite. The dolomite is suggested as the source of CaCO3 for the 

carbonatic halo. Metric to decimetric intercalations of carbonaceous phyllite from carbonatic halo and 

the phyllic halo commonly occur due to deformation. Rare BCS dikes crosscut the carbonatic halo. 

The carbonaceous phyllite in this halo presents medium gray color, which varies in tone with more or 

less carbonaceous matter or carbonate abundance. It presents a fairly common brecciated aspect and 

also centimetric greenish zones due to chlorite alteration. Carbonate pockets and veins are common 

with millimeter to centimeter sizes. Hydrothermalized mafic pockets are common along all of the 

carbonatic halo and consist of a carbonate-sericite-biotite-chlorite-quartz assemblage.  

General mineral assemblage of the carbonatic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite show 

dolomite/ankerite/calcite &amp;lt;1 to 87 vol%, quartz 10-20 vol%, chlorite 0-15 vol%, carbonaceous matter 

3-10 vol%, feldspar 3-5 vol%, illite/muscovite/kaolinite 0-5 vol%, biotite 0-2 vol%, plagioclase 0-1 

vol%, clinozoisite &amp;lt;1 vol%, titanite, and zircon &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrhotite 0-2 

vol%, pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &amp;lt;1 vol%, chalcopyrite &amp;lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 vol%, rutile 0-1 

vol%, and magnetite &amp;lt;1 vol%.  



37 
 

 

 



38 
 

 

 

The Phyllic halo pervasively selective affects the carbonaceous phyllite and the GNCX, with 

thicknesses of 1.7 to 14.2 m, thickening progressively along the Ingá orebody plunge (Fig. 4L and 4M, 

Fig. 5B and 5E). The carbonaceous phyllite has a diffuse gradational upper contact with the carbonatic 

halo and a diffuse gradational lower contact with the potassic halo. For the GNCX, it has a diffuse 

gradational upper contact with the potassic halo and a diffuse interdigitated lower contact with the 

metagraywacke. White mica in this halo was identified by SEM, XRD, and EMP as being mainly 

phengitic muscovite, with subordinated illite and kaolinite. Millimeter to centimeter-scale quartz veins 

are common, with assimilated host rock fragments. Sub-millimetric carbonate veining is rare. 

Centimeter to meter-scale light gray levels present subordinated potassic alteration pervasively 

selective overprinting the phyllic alteration. The phyllic halo on carbonaceous phyllite rarely present 

disperse carbonaceous matter clasts concentrated in centimetric levels. This is common in the GNCX, 

which indicates metagraywacke contribution. Late subordinated chloritization is common. QGSS 

dikes rarely crosscut the phyllic halo carbonaceous phyllite. Dolomite lenses rarely crosscut the 

GNCX. 

 The general mineral assemblage of the phyllic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: 

quartz 20-40 vol%, white mica 8-30 vol%, carbonaceous matter 4-30 vol%, biotite 5-20 vol%, garnet 

0-12 vol%, carbonate 0-13 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, chlorite 1-6 vol%, clinozoisite 0-3 vol%, 



39 
 

 

plagioclase 0-1 vol%, titanite &amp;lt;1 vol%, zircon &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrothite 1-4 

vol%, chalcopyrite 1 vol%, ilmenite&amp;lt;1 to 2.5 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 vol%, rutile &amp;lt;1 vol%, magnetite &amp;lt;1 

vol%, and pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%. General mineral assemblage of the phyllic halo over the quartz-

chlorite-sericite-garnet schist include: quartz 20-40 vol%, white mica 15-35 vol%, carbonaceous 

matter 5-25 vol%, biotite 6-15 vol%, garnet 4-13 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, chlorite 1-4 vol%, 

hornblende 0-4 vol%, clinozoisite 0-5 vol%, carbonate&amp;lt;1 vol%, and plagioclase &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore 

mineralogy includes: pyrrhotite &amp;lt;1 to 3 vol%, chalcopyrite &amp;lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &amp;lt;1 to 1 vol%, 

magnetite &amp;lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

 The potassic halo affects the carbonaceous phyllite and the GNCX pervasively-selective with 

thickness of 1.6 to 17.3 meters, increasing progressively along the Ingá orebody plunge (Fig. 4L, Fig. 

5C and 5F). It presents a gradational and diffuse contact with the phyllic and silicification halo in both 

carbonaceous phyllite and GNCX. The ferri-biotite was identified as characteristic of this halo by 

SEM, XRD, and EMP and it occurs as an abrupt overprinting of the phyllic alteration, giving a 

yellowish dark gray coloration to the host rock. Garnets become light gray due to this overprint. 

Posterior decimetric quartz-carbonate venulations are common, containing carbonaceous phyllite or 

GNCX fragments. Late rare subordinated pervasive silicification occurs related to this veining, 

increasing abundance towards the major quartz vein. It presents disperse carbonaceous matter clasts 

concentrated in some centimetric levels indicating metagraywacke contribution. 

General mineral assemblage of the potassic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: 

quartz 20-40 vol%, carbonaceous matter 1-23 vol%, biotite 15-20 vol%, garnet 0-12 vol%, apatite 0-

11 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8%, white mica 0-4 vol%, chlorite 0-3 vol%, carbonate &amp;lt;1 vol%, titanite &amp;lt;1 

vol%, plagioclase &amp;lt;1 vol%, zircon &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrhotite 0-3 vol%, ilmenite 

0-2 vol%, chalcopyrite &amp;lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 vol%, magnetite &amp;lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

General mineral assemblage of the potassic halo over the GNCX includes: quartz 20-40 vol%, biotite 

17-25 vol%, carbonaceous matter 2-25 vol%, white mica 0-20 vol%, hornblende 0-23 vol%, garnet 4-

13 vol%, chlorite 1-10 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, carbonate &amp;lt;1 vol%, zircon &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore 

mineralogy includes: pyrrothite&amp;lt;1-1.5 vol%, chalcopyrite &amp;lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &amp;lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 

vol%, magnetite &amp;lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

The silicification halo (Fig. 4F and 4K, Fig. 5D) affects the carbonaceous phyllite pervasively 

with thickness of 0.8 to 17.7 meters outwards from the major quartz vein (VQZ). Its thickness has a 

positive correlation with the thickness of the major quartz vein, decreasing progressively along the 

Ingá orebody plunge. The silicification intensity is determined by the abundance of quartz crystals and 

increases towards the thrust structure III and VQZ. Its upper and lower limits are in gradational, 

diffuse contact with the potassic halo, overprinting it. It presents dark gray color varying to lighter 

tones due to silicification intensity. Carbonaceous phyllite and milky quartz veins occur interdigitated 

in decimetric intervals due to the assimilation of quartz veins. In intervals of very high silicification, 



40 
 

 

garnet disappears. When the silicification halo reaches the GNCX, the silicification almost ceases due 

to the reactivity differences between silicification and the host rock, marking the lower limit of the 

silicification halo. QGCS dikes rarely crosscut this halo and do so with abrupt contacts. In the 

silicification halo, particularly in the venulations, millimetric chlorite occurs disseminated over the 

quartz with 1-5 vol%. Free gold and gold in the Aspy3 concentrates in the carbonaceous phyllite 

mainly in the hanging-wall of the major quartz vein. The carbonaceous phyllite in the footwall of the 

VQZ, which contains Aspy1, rarely contains gold as free crystals within the matrix. 

Measured foliation data (n=58) in the Ingá carbonaceous schist (Fig. 6) show an average 

azimuth value of 229º (200-300°) and an average dip value of 39º (25-66º). Measured L2 stretching 

lineation data (n=50), that marks the mineralization plunge, show an average trend value of 275º (260-

315º) and an average plunge value of 27º (20-57º). S0 was not observed in Ingá orebody due to the 

penetrative character of the S1 foliation. S0 and S1 foliation in the Ingá orebody are assumed to be 

parallel to sub-parallel to S2. The axial surface of F2 folds are rarely physically present, marked by the 

rotation of mica flakes formed during D1, thus statistically few F2 fold axis measurements were 

collected. S3 and S4 foliations were not observed at Ingá orebody gallery. S3 foliation was observed in 

Ingá exploration drill holes, but as the drill holes were not oriented, it was not possible to get absolute 

measurements.

General mineral assemblage of the silicification halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: 

quartz 25-60 vol%, biotite 2-30 vol%, white mica 0-32 vol%, garnet 0-25 vol%, carbonaceous matter 

0-30 vol%, carbonate 0-15 vol%, clinozoisite 0-10 vol%, k-feldspar 4-7 vol%, hornblende 0-7 vol%, 

chlorite 0-5 vol%, apatite 0-5 vol%, tourmaline 0-4 vol%, plagioclase 0-2 vol%, roscoelite &amp;lt;1 vol%, 



41 
 

 

titatine &amp;lt;1 vol%, and zircon &amp;lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: Aspy2 and Aspy3 0-15 vol%, 

pyrrhothite &amp;lt;1-8 vol%, ilmenite 0-5 vol%, chalcopyrite 0-1 vol%, Aspy1 &amp;lt;1 vol%, magnetite &amp;lt;1 

vol%, pentlandite &amp;lt;1 vol%, rutile &amp;lt;1 vol%, and gold &amp;lt;1 vol%. 

Hydrothermal Alteration Geochemistry 

The main hydrothermal minerals in the area were analysed in detail, including: carbonates, 

white mica, biotite, quartz, chlorite, and garnet. The carbonate (0-87 vol%), in the alteration haloes 

was analyzed by SEM and quantitative analysis in XRD (n=20) with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-

chlorite-sericite-garnet schist as host rocks. Carbonate crystals are &amp;lt;0.003 to 2.4 mm in size and occur 

in three ways: (1) crystalline aggregates in venulations and pockets, (2) crystalline aggregates in the 

matrix, and (3) amorphous tardi disseminated aggregates on other crystals in the matrix. Type three 

rarely occurs in Aspy2 and Aspy3 fractures and margins. Carbonate crystals acquire a strained shape 

when oriented along S2 foliation, but mainly are rounded with no preferred orientation. Carbonate 

crystals are pointed by submillimetric carbonaceous matter with a quartz and illite/kaolinite overprint, 

lending a dirty aspect to the crystal. Carbonate1 and Carbonate2 composition is mainly ankerite with 

subordinated calcite and very rare dolomite in the phyllic and potassic zones over GXN and GNCX 

and in the silicification zone over GXN. In the carbonatic zone, the Carbonate1 and Carbonate2 

composition is mainly dolomite with rare calcite. Carbonate3 composition is calcite in all 

hydrothermal alteration haloes. 

 White mica in the alteration haloes (0-35 vol%) was analyzed by SEM, quantitative analysis in 

EMP (n=48) and in XRD (n=20) with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist 

as host rocks (Table 5). White mica crystals are &amp;lt;0.003 to 0.25 mm in size and occurs as aggregates in 

two ways: (1) disseminated in the matrix or (2) in quartz-carbonate microvenulations. White mica1 

occurs mainly along S2 foliation but also is common oblique/perpendicular to S2 foliation. White 

mica1 has weak to regular cleavage while White mica2 has good cleavage. White mica1 and 2 show 

partial to total alteration to chlorite. White mica1 and 2 compositions are the same (Fig. 8G), classified 

as phengitic muscovite: Fe+Mg (0.27-0.49; Avg 0.36), K (1.66-1.78; Avg 1.73), Al iv (1.70-1.97; Avg 

1.86), Al vi (3.54-3.78; Avg 3.67), and Al total (5.24-5.75; Avg 5.53). Fine-grained white mica &amp;lt;

0.003 mm that forms argilominerals is classified as kaolinite and illite by XRD analysis. Particularly 

in the carbonatic zone, the phengitic muscovite occurs in mafic hydrothermalized pockets. 



42 
 

 

 



43 
 

 

 Biotite in the alteration haloes (0-30 vol%) was analyzed by SEM and quantitative analysis in 

EMP (n=48), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist as host rocks (Table 

5). Biotite crystals are &amp;lt;0.003 to 0.3 mm in size, commonly fragmented, and display light to dark-

orange pleochroism. Biotite occurs in two ways: (1) disseminated in the matrix along the S2 foliation 

and (2) oblique/perpendicular to S2 foliation forming crystal aggregates without preferred orientation 

and with variable sizes. The Biotite1 is interpreted to be of metamorphic origin and Biotite2 is 

interpreted to be hydrothermal. Biotite1 crystals are allotriomorphic to hipidiomorphic in shape, 

showing weak to regular cleavage. Biotite2 crystals are hipidiomorphic to idiomorphic in shape 

showing regular to good cleavage and darker orange tones in pleochroism. Biotite1 and 2 show partial 

to total alteration to late chlorite. Biotite1 and Biotite2 compositions are approximately the same (Fig. 

8E), classified as ferri-biotite according to the classification diagram by Speer (1981) and Deer et al. 

(1986): Fe/(Fe+Mg) (0.43-0.57; Avg 0.48), Al iv (2.43-2.58; Avg 2.50) and Al (total) (3.22-3.48; Avg 

3.36). Particularly in the carbonatic zone, the Biotite2 occurs in mafic hydrothermalized pockets. 

 Chlorite in the alteration haloes (0-15 vol%) was analyzed by element mapping in SEM and 

quantitative analysis in EMP (n=41) and XRD (n=20), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-

sericite-garnet schist as host rocks (Table 5). Chlorite is &amp;lt;0.003 to 0.23 mm in size and has good 

cleavage. Chlorite occurs in two ways: (1) disseminated crystals in the matrix, the product of selective 

alteration of phyllosilicates, and (2) disseminated non-oriented aggregates in quartz-carbonate 

venulations. Chlorite1 and Chlorite2 compositions are approximately the same (Fig. 8F), classified as 

Ripidolite, according to the classification of Hey (1954): Fe/(Fe+Mg) (0.45-0.51; Avg 0.49) and Si28 

(5.06-5.38; Avg 5.24). Quartz in the alteration haloes (10-60 vol%) as well as in the major quartz vein 

was microstructurally analysed and is almost entirely recrystallized probably due to subgrain rotation 

and recrystallization during crystal-plastic deformation (Passchier and Trouw, 2005). 

Garnet in the alteration haloes (0-25 vol%) was analyzed by element mapping in SEM and 

quantitative analysis in EMP (n=139), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet 

schist as host rocks (Table 5). Garnet crystals have 0.016 to 4.5 mm in size and hipidiomorphic-

idiomorphic shape.  They have a whitish to light pink color and are mainly zonated. The zonation is 

concentric and marked by the inclusion of fine carbonaceous matter in the garnet core. Garnet crystals 

are commonly associated with a greater concentration of mafic minerals and often form aggregates 

with ore minerals (ilmenite and chalcopyrite) and quartz inclusions. The carbonaceous matter mark the 

margins of the garnet crystals, which are moderately to highly fractured, with rare fractures filled by 

chalcopyrite. Two types of garnet were interpreted: (1) zoned garnet with calcic margin and (2) garnet 

without zonation or with incipient zonation. Both are predominantly composed of almandine and have 

a manganese core. The zoned garnet contains Alm 68,08-77,85 Grs 10,97-22,22 Pyp 3,47-8,01 Sps 0,93-11,38 Andr 

0,07-1,77 Uv 0,00-0,43 , a calcic margin, and a manganese core. The second type contains Alm 64,12-73,82 Grs 

16,88-22,78 Pyp 3,53-7,68 Sps 0,89-12,15 Andr 0,00-1,42 Uv 0,00-0,24 and a manganese core. Both have higher 

concentrations of espessartite (Mn) in their cores and the Garnet1 show grossular and andradite 



44 
 

 

contribution (Ca) more significant in the margins (Fig. 8A-D). Garnet1 and Garnet2 are mostly 

metamorphic and pre-kinematics, with rare rotated crystals, but the crystals containing ilmenite and 

chalcopyrite as aggregates and in fractures underwent later deformation and hydrothermal alteration.

A rigorous analysis of the volume and component concentration changes in the altered rocks 

(Table 4) was performed using the best-fit isocon method (Grant, 1986). This method quantifies the 

geochemical differences between altered and unaltered lithologies. When coupled with mineralogy it 

allows for the understanding of the migration of hydrothermal alteration along stratigraphy. Based on 

drill core logging, petrography, and whole-rock geochemical analysis, samples were selected to define 

the average composition of the least altered carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet 

schist. These samples were collected in lenses within the metagraywacke sequence that were not 

subjected to hydrothermal alteration. Al2O3 and or TiO2 were used as the least mobile elements to 

define the best-fit isocon, based on the average cluster of slopes for these elements. Selenium was used 

as the least mobile element for the carbonatic zone altered carbonaceous phyllite, specifically. The 

isocon is a reference line passing through the origin, which correspond to zero concentration change, 

in a plot of the least altered sample versus the most altered sample. Elements data should be analyzed 

carefully due to hampering by the upper detection limit (As) and lower detection limit (SrO, Ge, Ag, 

Cd, Mo, Hg and Sb).

phyllite, LA = least altered, PHY = phyllic halo, POT = potassic halo, GNCX = quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, SIL = silicification 

halo.  

Major gains in CaO and MgO, minor gains in MnO, and major losses in almost all other bulk 

oxides in carbonatic zone GXN show the pervasive carbonate alteration over the carbonaceous 

phyllite. Minor to major gains in K2O in altered GXN and GNCX reflect phyllic (muscovite) and 

potassic (ferri-biotite) alteration of the least altered host rock. Al2O3 is immobile and therefore does 

not manifest any notable change due to phyllic or potassic alteration. Major to minor losses and minor 

gains of SiO2 in altered GXN and GNCX reflect the relative increase in Fe2O3 due to sulfidation and 

CaO due to carbonate in quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veining and pods, compared to silicification 

effects. The least altered GXN and GNCX has a quartz-feldspatic matrix which masks the subsequent 

increase in SiO2 content along hydrothermal alteration zones. Major to minor gains in CaO and MnO 

in the silification zone of GXN, and the phyllic and potassic zones of GNCX may reflect an increase 

in almandine garnet, with Ca-rich margins and Mn-rich cores. Overall LOI% increase in all altered 

GXN and GNCX compared to the least altered samples is related to an increase in micas (bound water 

OH+), carbonate minerals (CO2), and carbonaceous matter. Overall carbon increase in all altered 

GXN and GNCX compared to the least altered samples is related to an increase in carbonaceous 

material contribution by the host rock and also related to pervasive carbonate mineral enrichment 

(carbonatic zone GXN) or quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veining. 

Major gains of Ba in all altered GXN and GNCX may be related to millimeter to centimeter 

scale quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veins that contain barite. Major to minor gains in S and major 

gains in Cu in altered GXN (except carbonatic zone GXN) and GNCX reflect an increase in sulfide 

minerals: arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, ilmenite, magnetite, pentlandite, and pyrrhotite. Carbonatic, 

phyllic, potassic and silicification zones of GXN and potassic zones of GNCX show major gains in As 

due to increase in Aspy content. Major to minor gains in Fe in potassic and silicification zones of 

GXN reflect an increase in sulfide minerals. Minor gains in TiO2 in silicification zones of GXN may 

be related to a relative increase in ilmenite and rutile abundance. Major gains of As, Ni, and Co in 

silicification zones of GXN may account for As-Ni-Co zonations within Aspy3. Spearman rank 

correlation matrix (Spearman, 1904) of gold with various elements revealed reasonable positive and 

negative gold correlation values: Bi (0.71), LOI (0.69), Te (0.69), S (0.64), Se (0.61), W (0.6), Cr 

(0.57), Ga (0.56), CaO (0.54), P2O5 (0.52), TiO2 (0.52), V (0.51), SiO2 (-0.7) for GXN and W (0.75), 

Sn (0.62), BaO (0.59), Ga (0.58), and Sb (0.52) for GNCX. Minor to major gains in Bi, Se, and Te in 

the altered GXN samples, especially in the silicification zone of GXN, reflects the good positive 



50 
 

 

correlation between these elements and gold abundance. Major to minor gains in Ba, W, Ga, and Sn in 

the potassic GNCX reflects the good positive correlation between these elements and gold abundance. 

The least altered Ingá carbonaceous phyllite and its different hydrothermal alteration haloes 

were normalized to the following worldwide shale references: Average Mud from Queensland (MUQ 

by Kamber et al., 2005), North American Shale Composite (NASC by Haskin et al., 1968), Post 

Archean Australian Shale (PAAS by Taylor and McLennan, 1985), Average Shales (AS by Piper, 

1974), and European Shales (ES by Haskin and Haskin, 1966). This method allowed for geochemical 

comparisons between different Ingá carbonaceous phyllites and worldwide known shales. The 

carbonate alteration zone of GXN is more depleted in REE than worldwide alteration zones and has a 

different overall character, mainly in regard to major oxides, probably due to the influence of 

dolomite. The phyllic and potassic alteration zones are enriched in LREE in comparison with 

worldwide alteration zones, followed by the least altered GXN and then by the silicified GXN. The 

potassic alteration zone is enriched in HREE in comparison with the other alteration zones, followed 

by the silicification GXN and then the least altered and phyllic GXN. There is a positive europium 

anomaly for all carbonaceous phyllites. Compared to all reference shales cited, the Ingá shales have 

strong enrichment in MgO, CaO, Cr, Ba, and W and strong depletion in TiO2 and most REE. 

Samples of different gold grades were collected in the idiomorphic-arsenopyrite rich 

carbonaceous phyllite and GNCX and compared in order to understand geochemical controls on gold 

in the sulfide rich host rock close to the major quartz vein and thrust fault. The high grade GXN was 

defined as &gt; 5g/t Au and the low to no grade GXN was defined as &amp;lt;2 g/t Au. The high grade GNCX 

was defined as &gt; 1 g/t Au and the low to no grade GNCX was defined as &amp;lt;1 g/t Au. These grades 

were statistically defined considering all GXN and GNCX Ingá drill core samples analysed for gold by 

fire assay by the geology and exploration department at the AngloGold Ashanti - Serra Grande Unit. 

High gold grade GXN samples are very enriched in Au, CaO, LOI, Sn, Sr, Bi, Se, Te, and S in 

comparison to low or no gold grade samples. High gold grade GNCX samples are very enriched in 

Au, Ba, Tm, Ni, and S and very depleted in SiO2 in comparison to low to no gold grade samples. This 

possibly indicates that there is no direct relation between gold and overall arsenopyrite abundance, 

with the exception of Arsenopyrite3 (explained in the next section). Binary and ternary plots with a 

variety of elements and ratios were attempted in order to differentiate the high gold grade from the low 

to no gold grade in the host rocks. For the carbonaceous phyllite, the most informative plots are the Bi 

ppm x Se pmm, S percent x Bi ppm, and S percent x P2O5 percent (Fig. 7A-B). For the GNCX the 

most informative plots are the Ta ppm x W ppm and Ga ppm x W ppm (Fig. 7C-D). 

Ore Mineralogy and Paragenesis 

With regards to ore mineralogy, the paragenetic sequence is composed of Pyrrhotite ± 

Pentlandite ± Arsenopyrite1 (Stage 1), Arsenopyrite2 (Stage II), Arsenopyrite3 ± Pyrrothite ± 

Chalcopyrite ± Ilmenite ± Rutile ± Magnetite ± Pentlandite ± visible Au (Stage III). The pyrrhotite 



51 
 

 

(Stages I and III) has allotriomorphic intrafoliar shape oriented along S2 foliation. Pyrrhotite is&amp;lt;0.003 

to 1.32 mm in size, with abundances varying from &amp;lt;1% to 8%. Pyrrothite (Po) commonly occurs as 

inclusions, filling fractures, or along Aspy3 margins. Po rarely occurs as inclusions in garnet, where it 

fills fractures or marks crystal margins. Po commonly presents chalcopyrite and rarely presents 

ilmenite along crystal margins and as inclusions. Magnetite inclusions and pentlandite flames 

commonly occur in Po. 

Ilmenite is oriented along S2 foliation, has an idiomorphic rod shape, and is commonly 

disseminated as free crystals that are&amp;lt;0.003 to 0.173 mm in size, with abundances varying from &amp;lt;1% 

to 2%. Ilmenite rarely occurs as inclusions or along the margins of pyrrhotite (Stages I and III) and as 

inclusions in zoned garnet and Aspy2 and Aspy3. Rarely contain magnetite inclusions. Rarely present 

partial alteration to rutile. The chalcopyrite has allotriomorphic shape and is randomly oriented. It is &amp;lt;

0.003 to 0.233 mm in size, with abundances varying from &amp;lt;1% to 1%. It occurs along crystal margins 

and as inclusions in pyrrhotite (Stages I and III) and in margins, filling fractures and as inclusions in 

Aspy2 and Aspy3. Rarely occurs as free crystals, along ilmenite margins, in association with rutile, in 

hornblende fractures, or as inclusions in zoned garnet and in zoned garnet fractures. 

The rutile is randomly oriented, has an idiomorphic shape, and is 0.1 to 3 mm in size, with 

abundances varying from&amp;lt;1% to 1%. Rutile occurs as free crystals in quartz-carbonate venulations 

associated with Aspy2, Aspy3, and visible gold. Where altered from ilmenite, it has allotriomorphic 

shape and sub-millimeter size with an abundance of &amp;lt;1%. Magnetite occurs as sub-millimeter 

rounded inclusions in Aspy2 and Aspy3, Po (Stages I and III), and ilmenite crystals, with an 

abundance of &amp;lt;1%. Pentlandite occurs as sub-millimeter irregular flames in pyrrhotite crystals (Stages 

I and III), with abundance of &amp;lt;1%. 

Visible gold is randomly oriented, has an allotriomorphic shape, and is &gt; 0.001 to 0.825 mm in 

size. It occurs in the mineralized zone mainly as free crystals in the basal level of the major quartz vein 

(Fig. 5G). In the carbonaceous phyllite, visible gold occurs mainly in the VQZ hanging-wall and rarely 

in the footwall. Gold occurs as free crystals in the matrix near the contact with biotite, sericite and 

carbonaceous matter (Fig. 5H) and rarely on rutile and pyrrhotite (Stage III) margins (Fig. 5K and 5L). 

Visible gold commonly occurs as inclusions, filling fractures or in margins of Aspy3 in the 

carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 5I and 5J). Visible gold rarely occurs as free crystals in the GNCX in the 

footwall of the VQZ or as inclusions, filling fractures or in margins of Aspy3 associated with 

secondary quartz veins that crosscut GXN and GNCX. 

Arsenopyrite Characterization 

 Three main arsenopyrite types have been defined at Ingá orebody in paragenetic sequence 

from arsenopyrite 1 (Aspy1) to arsenopyrite 3 (Apsy3): 



52 
 

 

Aspy1 occurs in the carbonaceous phyllite and GNCX, oriented along S2 foliation. It has 

allotriomorphic shape, is porous, and is 0.004 m to 19 mm in size. Aspy1 is commonly associated with 

symmetric to asymmetric strain shadows. Aspy1 is rarely associated with pyrrothite (Stage I) margins. 

No SEM, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS analysis were done in this type of arsenopyrite for the present work 

because its zones of occurrence have no relevant grade. Further studies shall consider the 

geochemistry of Aspy1 for comparison with Aspy2 and Aspy3. 

Aspy2 and Aspy3 (Fig 9A-J) occur until three meters adjacent to VQZ, crosscutting the 

silicification halo of the carbonaceous phyllite, and until within one meter of secondary quartz veins, 

crosscutting GXN and GNCX. In gallery scale the Aspy2 and Aspy3 were only observed in the host 

rock in the hanging-wall of the major quartz vein. It is impossible to separate both by naked eye, so 

microanalysis is necessary (i.e. SEM, EMP, LA-ICP-MS). It is randomly oriented, has a zonated 

idiomorphic shape, and is 15 mm to 5 cm in size. Cruciform twins are common. It is associated with 

pyrrothite (Stage III) and chalcopyrite on or near margins, in fractures, or as inclusions. Magnetite 

(common) and ilmenite (rare) occur as inclusions. It is rarely associated with rutile. Amorphous 

ankerite rarely occurs in Aspy2 and Aspy3 fractures and margins. The differences between Aspy2 and 

Aspy3 include textures and chemical zonation. Aspy2 makes up the core of the idiomorphic Aspy 

crystal and is richer in S. Aspy3 occurs along the margins and fractures of Aspy2 crystals, forming 

irregular inclusion-rich margins with a sieve texture. Aspy3 presents higher concentrations of As-Ni-

Co than Aspy2, with random Ni-Co zonations as attested by EMP (Fig. 9G-H). Visible gold 

concentrates only in Aspy3, along its margins, fractures (two sets), or as inclusions (Fig. 5I and 5J, 

Fig. 8I). Table 6A shows that Aspy2 (n=65) is EMP geochemically characterized by wt% S (19.02-

22.98; Avg 21.29), As (42.18-46.63; Avg 44.26), Ni (0.05-0.62; Avg 0.17), Co (0.03-0.78; Avg 0.11), 

and Fe (32.61-35.24 wt%; Avg 34.56). Aspy3 (n=48) is EMP geochemically characterized by wt% S 

(18.7-20.73; Avg 19.62), As (45.41-47.47; Avg 46.47), Ni (0.05-3.97; Avg 0.51), Co (0.02-0.48; Avg 

0.17), and Fe (29.76-34.78; Avg 33.52). Two arsenopyrite types have been reported by Fortes (1996) 

in the Mina III orebody at the same stratigraphic level, after observations in SEM of S and As 

geochemistry, which approximately correspond to Aspy2 and Aspy3 of the present paper.

LA-ICP-MS spot analysis and element mapping were performed on Aspy2 and Aspy3 with a 

focus on their cores, margins, and fractures. Spatial decoupling between elements reflects, in part, 

geochemically distinct arsenopyrite domains. Table 6B show that, overall, Aspy2 has (median) &gt; 100 

ppm of Fe, S, As, Ni, Co, Te, and Zn, &gt; 10 ppm of Cu, Sb, and Se, &gt; 1 ppm of Cr, V, and Pb, and &amp;lt;1 

ppm of Mo, Re, Au, Bi, Sn, W, and Cd, while Aspy3 has overall &gt; 100 ppm of Fe, As, S, Ni, Co, Se, 

and Te, &gt; 10 ppm of Sb, Zn, Cr, and Bi, &gt; 1 ppm of Pb, V, Cu, and Sn, and &amp;lt;1 ppm of Au, W, Re, Cd, 

and Mo. Elements Pd and Ag all had analysis below the detection limit, Pr and In had only two 

analyses above the detection limit and Au, Bi, Mo, Cd, W, and Sn had significant data below the 

detection limit. Table 6B compares the median and geometric mean trace element concentrations of 

Aspy3 compared to Aspy2. Aspy3 has &gt; 200% positive change (median) of Bi, Pb, As, Se, Cr, Cd, Sn, 

and V, &gt; 100% of W and Ni, &gt; 30% of Au, Sb, Co, and Fe and &amp;lt;10-100% negative change (median) 

of Cu, S, Mo, Zn, Re, and Te compared to Aspy2. Box plot analysis (Fig. 10) show marked low S, Cu, 

and Mo concentrations and marked high As, Cr, Bi, Se, Co, Ni, Pb, V, and Sn concentrations in Aspy3 

compared to Aspy2. Probability plots, split probability plots, scaled coordinates (minimum zero to 

maximum one), and spider plot (Aspy3 compared to Aspy2), indicate relative high concentrations of 

As, Bi, Cr, Se, Ni, and Sn in Aspy3 compared to Aspy2 and relative high concentrations of S, Cu, and 

Mo in Aspy2 compared to Aspy3.

Arsenium, bulk element for Aspy3 recognition in margins and fracture zones, show marked 

positive Pearson correlation with Se, Ni, Fe, Cr, Sb, Co, Bi, Te, Sn, and V. Elements As, Fe, Co, and 

Ni show a similar behavior, as detected by the EMP analysis. Sulfur, bulk element for Aspy2 

recognition in core zones, shows marked positive Pearson correlation with Cu, Re, W, Mo, Zn, and 

Cd. Aspy2 is then relatively depleted in most trace elements and base metals, while Aspy3 is relatively 

enriched uniformly in some and erratic in others, showing systematic variations in selected trace 

elements. This variability may indicate that these elements occur, at least in part, as nanoparticles. Due 



57 
 

 

to its nugget effect, both Aspy2 and Aspy3 show weak positive Pearson correlation gold values, with 

Aspy3 values (&lt;0.5 – 2.18 ppm) 43% higher than Aspy2 values (&lt;0.5 – 2.31 ppm). Of the nine spot 

analyses in Aspy2, four (44%) have gold concentrations above the detection limit (&gt; 0.5 ppm), 

showing that invisible gold could exist as submicroscopic particles or could be present  non-uniformly 

as a solid solution within the host arsenopyrite lattice. Aspy crystals possess then a complex reworking 

story characterized by variable precious and base metal enrichment. Outliers concentrations observed 

in the data and the box plot analyses indicate the presence of micro-inclusions in the host arsenopyrite 

containing Pb (galena), Zn (sphalerite), Cu (chalcopyrite), S (sulfides), V, Cd, Te, Mo, and Sn. 

Cadmium shows a strong relationship with Zn in PCA plot analysis (PC3, 2.8 eigenvalue, 0.66 scaled 

coordinates), indicating possible high Cd content in sphalerite micro-inclusions as described by Berner 

et al. (2013). Tellurim could be related to the presence of Au-Bi-Mo telluride micro-inclusions. 

Element mapping was done on three arsenopyrite crystals of thin section 55-16. Figure 11 shows an 

example from Aspy3, which has marked high concentrations of Au, Ag, Bi, and Ni and slightly 

marked high concentrations of Pb, Co, Te, Se, and Re, while Aspy2 shows marked high concentrations 

of Mo and Sb and slightly marked high concentrations of Zn and W. There are two distinct fracture 

sets in arsenopyrite, in which a later, more developed set crosscut a previous, less developed set. Both 

are gold rich and contain the same elemental assemblage as Aspy3, making it impossible to identify 

any difference regarding mineralogy and geochemistry. There are elevated concentrations of trace 

elements in the fractures (Aspy3) compared to the inclusion-free undeformed arsenopyrite zones 

(Aspy2).

Discussion 

Arsenopyrite and possible gold remobilization 

The arsenopyrite texture and geochemical zonation is directly linked to the gold abundance in 

the carbonaceous phyllite and GNCX adjacent to the major quartz vein, as well as the gold-rich major 

quartz vein emplacement. Archean basins, once formed, represent zones of long-lived structural 

weakness and remain favorable settings for gold mineralization and/or remobilization during 



61 
 

 

subsequent reworking (Lawley et al., 2015). Gold, if present within Aspy, is often heterogeneously 

distributed within compositionally zoned grains (Morey et al., 2008). Gold poor cores and enrichment 

along growth zones toward grain margins were documented by Johan et al. (1989), Fleet et al. (1989), 

Mumin et al. (1994), Oberthur et al. (1997), Fleet and Mumin (1997), Genkin et al. (1998), and Cook 

et al. (2013). Gold redistribution by remobilization from the sulfide lattice and reconcentration (as 

inclusions of gold or electrum) within or near the parent mineral is recognized as an important process 

(e.g., Larocque et al., 1995). Remobilization may be recognized in gold ores, which have developed 

during a sequence of fluid inputs and prolonged fluid infiltration at temperatures consistent with 

greenschist facies metamorphism or above or below, generally under oriented strain (Cook et al., 

2013). Oscillatory zoning with respect to the essential elements (Fe, As, and S) and with respect to Co 

and Ni, common minor constituents in arsenopyrite, has been previously reported (Cathelineau et al., 

1989; Morey et al., 2008, Cook et al., 2013). 

The Aspy2 and Aspy3 crystals are concentrated within the selvages of the major quartz vein, 

showing its late hydrothermal character, in comparison to the early Aspy1 that is wrapped by the S2 

foliation commonly showing strain shadows. In gallery scale, only the major quartz vein hanging-wall 

contains carbonaceous phyllite rich in Aspy2 and Aspy3. Gold-rich Aspy3 concentrated on late 

arsenopyrite crystal fractures and inclusion-rich sieve-textured boundaries are in contrast with gold-

poor Aspy2 concentrated in the arsenopyrite interior. This contrast is possibly related to post 

crystallization gold enrichment along late crystal fractures and selective alteration toward the margins, 

forming Aspy3. This post crystallization fluid-assisted remobilization of precious and base metals 

possibly occurred during successive deformation events (Tomkins and Mavrogenes, 2001; Wagner et 

al., 2007; Morey et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2013; Lawley et al., 2015; Fougerouse 

et al., 2017; Gourcerol et al., 2018). Inclusion-rich sieve-textured Aspy3 domains and fracture 

networks are possibly enriched in precious and base metals and contain clusters of native gold, 

pyrrothite (Stage III), chalcopyrite, magnetite, and ilmenite inclusions. Geochemically anomalous 

domains are demarcated by trails of mineral inclusions and/or embayed crystal boundaries. These 

textures suggest that Aspy2 and Aspy3 crystals possess complex reworking histories characterized by 

variable precious and base metal enrichment. This grain boundary-fracture association suggests an 

external influence and given the lack of other mineral phases containing arsenium and sulphur, 

introduction of a late hydrothermal fluid is thought to be responsible for this association (Morey et al., 

2008). This fluid would penetrate along grain borders, possibly promoting fracturing and facilitating 

reaction progress. The resulting Aspy3 rims are thus considered to be alteration rims. 

Zoning patterns and intermediate compositions between Aspy2 and Aspy3 suggests constant 

changes in fluid pressure and fluid flow regime. The intermediate compositions are attested by the 

gray shading in BSE imaging in SEM and EMP. This gray shading has previously been attributed to 

Aspy growth zoning and the substitution of As for S within Aspy crystals in response to changing 

conditions, as attested by experimental studies (Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp et al., 1985; 



62 
 

 

Carpenter, 2003; Lawley et al., 2015). Typical Aspy2 and Aspy3 are the end members of intermediate 

compositions. Progressive mineral precipitation during wall-rock alteration by hydrothermal fluid 

would result in a gradual compositional change of precipitating minerals. These observations support a 

model for Au distribution in Ingá arsenopyrite involving possible grain-scale remobilization during 

deformation and subsequent Au reconcentration at or close to grain margins and within intragranular 

microfractures. Possibly remobilized gold must have originally been incorporated within sulfides and 

was later released, rather than being supplied at the time of brittle-ductile fracture. Release of gold 

possibly took place in response to deformation. Some remobilization of gold from sulfides to free gold 

accumulations might occur during F2 folding in the Crixás greenstone belt (S. Ulrich, pers. commun., 

2014). Such a major event in its late brittle-ductile stages was probably responsible for the possible 

remobilization of an inferred invisible gold from Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3. 

It can be difficult to resolve the timing of gold incorporation in sulfides of the Ingá with a 

single orogenic gold deposit model, because superimposed, later stages of deformation cause Au to be 

released from arsenian pyrite or arsenopyrite (Large et al., 2011). Gold was released either into the ore 

fluid or, more likely, was concentrated at or close to grain boundaries. Sulfide crystallization could 

have occurred before veining and the main phase of Au deposition, during the same stage but later, or 

after vein formation. Sulfides may also have been formed throughout (i.e., at multiple different stages) 

the mineralization event. The variation in grain size, morphology and geochemistry of arsenopyrite 

crystals at Ingá indicates at least three stages of arsenopyrite deposition: Aspy1 (early hydrothermal), 

Aspy2 (late hydrothermal) and Aspy3 (later hydrothermal-remobilization). Considering that 

hydrothermal sulfides occur at the margin of reworked veins and also disseminated in wall rock, it is 

most likely that they formed at the end of a mineralization event after the fluid became supersaturated 

and precipitated the majority of gold. Fluids were, nevertheless, Au-bearing at the time of sulfide 

formation and available Au was scavenged by, and possibly preferentially partitioned into Aspy2. 

Subsequent deformation possibly released Au, giving rise to a population of visible gold grains in the 

sulfides and adjacent areas, contributing to the overall Au budget. The observed Au enrichment toward 

the grain margins and, critically, the presence of nano to micro-pores in the same parts of the grain, 

indicate that Au release could have been assisted by late percolating fluids via reactions between 

preexisting arsenopyrite, leading to partial dissolution. This reinforces the idea that Au release is 

activated by infiltration under deformation (Pokrovski et al., 2002; Cook et al., 2009; Sung et al., 

2009; Ciobanu et al., 2012) and not solid state diffusion as explained by Tomkins and Mavrogenes 

(2002). In the Ingá orebody, fluid infiltration along fractures was probably critical for Au 

remobilization. 

There is a general consensus that indicates a positive correlation between Au and As in 

arsenian pyrite (Cook and Chrysssoulis, 1990; Simon et al., 1999b; Large et al., 2009), which may be 

applied to arsenopyrite. As and Co composition show an inverse relation with Fe, indicating the 

replacement of Fe by Co in the Aspy structure. A number of studies show that Au in solid solution 



63 
 

 

exchanges for Fe sites within arsenopyrite and pyrite (Wu and Delbove, 1989; Fleet and Mumin, 1997; 

Tarnocai et al., 1997), promoting an inverse correlation. Aspy EMP and LA-ICP-MS element maps 

and spot analyses reported herein provide possible evidence for relatively late gold enrichment that is, 

in part, linked to the post crystallization history of early sulfides. Fluid assisted and/or deformation 

driven sulfide dissolution likely mobilized these elements from older sulfide minerals. Recrystallized 

arsenopyrite domains (i.e. sieve-textured crystal boundary Aspy and domains adjacent to fractures) are 

enriched in precious and base metals as attested by LA-ICP-MS analysis on Aspy3. Trace elements in 

arsenopyrite occurs as (1) lattice substitution (i.e. in solid solution) or (2) inclusions of nanoparticles 

or visible inclusions (Huston et al., 1995; Deditius et al., 2011). The presence of As in arsenopyrite, in 

substitution for As in the S site, distorts the arsenopyrite lattice, making it easier for large cations (i.e. 

Au, Pb, Bi) to be incorporated into the arsenopyrite, and at higher concentrations, these elements are 

incorporated in micro-inclusions of Bi-Pb-Au that contain tellurides, selenides, or galena enriched in 

Bi, Au, Se, and Te or Au-Sb-Te phases (Gregory et al., 2016). These micro-inclusions occur at low-

strain micro-textural sites and/or are present as clusters. Mineral inclusion clusters (e.g., sieve-textured 

Aspy) and variably replaced early sulfide phases are microtextures typical of metamorphosed deposits 

(Tomkins and Mavrogenes, 2001 and Lawley et al., 2015). We interpret that the two distinct set of 

fractures observed, with the same geochemical and mineralogical assemblage, actually belong to one 

conjugated fracture set, with the same importance regarding gold remobilization and mineralization, 

both considered Aspy3 zones. Our observations are consistent with and complement those of Morey et 

al. (2008) and Cook et al. (2013), who also considered textural and grain-scale geochemical evidence 

in arsenopyrite for cycles of hydrothermal infiltration, alteration, and remobilization during evolution 

of a gold ore. Two combined processes could explain the overall lower trace element content of Aspy2 

compared to Aspy3: (1) trace elements were depleted in the early hydrothermal fluids compared to the 

evolved, (2) trace elements were present in the early fluids but incorporated into other minerals (such 

as chalcopyrite or pyrrhotite) or formed accessory phases (e.g. such as Au tellurides, As-bearing 

minerals). 

Aylmore and Graham (1992) concluded that a high percentage of the gold occurs either as fine 

inclusions or is located in a lattice defect or interstitial site of arsenopyrite. Previous studies concluded 

that invisible gold can occur in solid solution within the host crystal lattice or exist as &amp;lt;1 ?m, 

submicroscopic particles (Cabri et al., 1989; Cabri et al., 2000; Genkin et al., 1998; Simon et al., 

1999a; Palenik et al., 2004; Morey et al., 2008). In ores subjected to deformation and/or hydrothermal 

alteration after formation, the greater part of the invisible gold incorporated in sulfides at the time of 

initial precipitation, if any, will be expelled from the sulfide lattice (e.g. Mumin et al., 1994; Large et 

al., 2007, 2009, Cook et al., 2013). The chemical state of gold in solid solution is complex, with 

studies suggesting an oxidation state of Au3+ (e.g., Arehart et al., 1993) or a combination of Au0 and 

Au1+ (e.g., Simon et al., 1999a and Cabri et al., 2000). Thus the speciation of gold in arsenopyrite is 

not well understood, in spite of intense studies over the last years (Cabri et al., 2000). In orogenic 



64 
 

 

systems, gold commonly has a bimodal distribution in which invisible gold within arsenopyrite is 

overprinted by later visible gold (Coleman, 1957; Mumin et al., 1994; Oberthür et al., 1997; Genkin et 

al., 1998). The formation of visible gold in Aspy3 is thought to be related to the post-crystallization 

fracturing and alteration. It is suggested that the submicron lattice bound gold that was probably 

exsolved from the Aspy2 crystal structure during renewed F2 folding, was then remobilized along 

secondary fractures and crystal margins characterized by the Aspy3 domain (Morey et al., 2008 and 

Sayab et al., 2016). The no to low gold grade contents of some idiomorphic arsenopyrite-rich 

carbonaceous phyllites close to the major quartz vein (e.g. drill hole II-485) is probably related to 

weak development of Aspy3 due to locally weak post crystallization remobilization and alteration 

during D2 deformation and overprint. 

It is unknown whether an increase in sulfur fugacity (fS2) alone can cause exsolution of 

possible invisible gold from arsenopyrite. An overall increase in temperature and sulfur fugacity (fS2) 

due to increase in the amount of S within the hydrothermal phase occurred. The excess S produced by 

the formation of As-rich alteration rims was responsible for this increase. These relationships are 

consistent with the observed gold-arsenopyrite textures and the notion that the solubility of gold in 

arsenopyrite decreases with increasing temperature (Barton, 1969; Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp 

et al., 1985). The observed gold-arsenopyrite relationships are best explained by a continuously 

evolving hydrothermal system, which is expected to preserve gradual changes in mineral chemistry. 

Furthermore, the higher-temperature event responsible for the Aspy3 rims may have involved only 

low fluid influx: complete alteration of the Aspy2 grains is more likely during a pervasive high fluid 

flux event. The lack of major arsenopyrite dissolution suggests that fO2 changes likely played a 

minimal role during arsenopyrite alteration (Heinrich and Eadington, 1986, Morey et al., 2008). If this 

secondary hot fluid was significantly undersaturated in gold, it would have possibly removed inferred 

invisible gold as it replaced the Aspy2. However, since abundant visible gold may have been formed 

during this stage, this secondary fluid was likely close to saturation and also could have deposited new 

metal. Fortes (1996) observations in Mina III, that indicate that gold is related to late Aspy3 phases, 

could therefore be correct, in part. 

Proposed formation model 

The Ingá orebody formed during successive events of deformation, metamorphism and 

hydrothermal alteration. The tholeiitic spills overloaded over the komatiitic spills formed a shallow 

flexural basin with deposition of pelitic-psamitic to chemical sediments when the stratigraphic 

sequence of the Ingá orebody was deposited, including: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite and pelites. 

Over the carbonaceous phyllites and pelites the graywacke was deposited, indicating an increase in 

sedimentary load (Fig. 12A). The primary features and the petrographic and geochemical properties of 

the graywackes (Jost et al., 1996) suggest that their clastic load derived from a source area that 

contained felsic to intermediate igneous and metamorphic rocks that were deposited by turbidity 



65 
 

 

currents with increasing energy towards the top (Jost et al., 2010). During the deposition of the 

sediments, forming S0, a distensive event simultaneously occurred, which thickened the graywacke 

layers and thinned the volcanic strata. This is evidenced by syn-depositional low angle normal faults. 

This sedimentary basin evolution is correlated to a shallow sea platform environment with proximity 

to the continental coast (A.J. Massucatto, pers. Commun., 2004). S0 in Ingá is not locally visible, 

neither in gallery, nor in drill holes, due to the proximity of the orebody to the thrust fault III, where 

S1 locally transpose S0 at a low angle.

The prograde metamorphic path is characterized by the greenschist facies garnet zone, 

forming the pre-hydrothermal assemblages of the Ingá orebody. During the prograde metamorphic 

path, isoclinal folding (F1) of bedding and early quartz veins occurred, developing dominant 

metamorphic schistosity S1 that reoriented crystals. The regional structure of the D1 thrust and thrust 

ramps suggests that the orebodies lie within an early, regional E-W to NNW-oriented basement-basin 

fault bend. This zone would have acted as an early zone of maximum extension during basin 

development with focusing of basin fluids into this area. This pre-dates mineralization, but may have 

set the architecture for later deep-seated fluid conduits. These block faults would allow enhanced 

upward migration of fluids into the thrust stack, as well as along thrust structures (T. Coughlin, 

pers. Commun., 2002). Fortes (1996) suggests the metasediments as the gold source for the 

hydrothermal fluids. During the retrograde metamorphic path, S1 reactivation and posterior 

sulphidation-mineralization occurred. Fluids migrated along S0 parallel to S1, facilitated by the low 

angle thrust fault III and related strain zones that acted as conduits allowing hydrothermal fluids 

percolation. Sulfide mineralization was then developed pre F2 folding, very likely during the 

reactivation of S1 schistosity at early stages of exhumation along the retrograde metamorphic path.  

Hydrothermal alteration of the peak metamorphic assemblage occurred mainly outwards from 

the low angle thrust fault III along S0 parallel to S1, forming the silicification, potassic, phyllic and 

carbonatic haloes within the carbonaceous phyllite and the potassic and phyllic haloes within the 

GNCX. The newly formed hydrothermal minerals (e.g. biotite and sericite) mimetize the S1 foliation. 

Possibly gold-poor Aspy1 was formed during the initial stages of hydrothermal alteration and is 

wrapped by the S1 foliation that was reactivated, also forming strain shadows. Possibly randomly 

oriented, invisible gold-rich Aspy2 (Fig. 12C) formed during the late stages of D1, accounting for part 

of the gold budget, occurring in the carbonaceous phyllite close to the low angle thrust fault III and 

related strain zones, under high fluid-flux conditions. The carbonaceous phyllite and its reduced 

characteristics acted as a chemical buffer for sulfide precipitation.  

During the late stages of D1, building of crack and seal veins (e.g. major quartz vein) parallel 

to S1 occurred during S1 reactivation, from fluid percolation due to permeability anisotropy within the 

carbonaceous phyllite. The major quartz vein tends to be emplaced following the floor thrust of the 

thrust fault III, which sits close to the contact of the carbonaceous phyllite with the GNCX, but may 

also follow weak zones within the host rock due to hydraulic fracturing, sometimes distant from this 

contact. Hydraulic fracturing is attested by deformed arsenopyrite-rich carbonaceous phyllite 

fragments in VQZ interior. Later folding of S1 with NW plunging F2 fold axes and strong NW-SE L2 

stretching, also forming boudinage, affected the VQZ. The VQZ core is, in general, massive, but 

increasingly sheared towards the walls, which indicates that it formed under extension, synchronously 

with penetrative fabrics in the host rock. These fabrics were later overprinted by continued shear zone 

movement (Platt, 1983) or from shear zone reactivation, part of subsequent generations of 

deformation. The competency difference between the major quartz vein and the carbonaceous phyllite, 



67 
 

 

indicates that the quartz vein concentrates stress, increasing the deformation magnitude in its 

surroundings, allowing an increase in the carbonaceous phyllite folding, originating strain features in 

contact with the VQZ. 

The common distribution of Au mineralization along the base of D1 quartz veins suggests that 

part of Au mineralization post-dated the quartz veins, and was commonly deposited by damming of 

mineralizing fluids during upward migration (L.R. Rankin, pers. Commun., 2004). Aspy2 and Aspy3 

inside the carbonaceous phyllite fragments could indicate pre-vein sulfide formation. The gold-rich 

fluids migrated upwards, mainly through the thrust fault III and related shear zones and precipitated 

the gold in the present Aspy2 and Aspy3-rich hanging-wall carbonaceous phyllite and in the basal 

level of the major quartz vein by damming, rarely passing through this basal level to the present 

footwall host rocks (pre D2 stratigraphic overturning). 

The D2 event is responsible for the stratigraphic overturning of the sequence (Fig. 12B), as 

evidenced by the common facing-down of volcanic and sedimentary primary structures and by the 

overriding of the metakomatiites onto the metabasalts, which in turn overrides the metasedimentary 

section (Jost et al., 2010). This D2 stratigraphic overturning formed the present configuration of the 

Ingá orebody stratigraphy. Later folding of S1 and S1 parallel to mineralization with NW plunging F2 

fold axes and strong L2 stretching occurred. NW-SE stretching and boudinage and N-S trending veins 

also formed. The F2 folding over the major quartz vein and host rocks possibly reconcentrated the 

gold parallel to F2 axis, locally increasing gold grades. F2 folding locally controls the Ingá ore shoot 

geometry along with NW-SE stretching, forming the Ingá orebody orientation that varies between 

260-315º trend and 20-57º plunge. There is a natural variability in F2 fold axis distribution due to 

strain heterogeneity or refraction due to F2 folding. During D2, a plane-axial cleavage (S2) was 

generated by pressure dissolution, causing the transposition of S0 and/or S1 and reorientation of 

minerals, mainly phyllosilicates.  

Possible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 

along late crystal fractures and selective alteration toward the margins occurred because of F2 folding, 

substantially increasing the orebody gold budget under low fluid-flux conditions (Fig. 12D and 12E). 

Possible remobilization of inferred invisible gold from Aspy2 to the major quartz vein and host rock 

gangue occurred as a consequence of F2 folding, as well as the possible new deposition of visible gold 

during subsequent mineralization events, forming visible gold concentrated in the base of the major 

quartz vein and disseminated in the carbonaceous phyllite gangue, mainly in the hanging-wall. The 

weak competency of the quartz vein in relation to F2 folding, causes disruptions in the folded zones, 

generating E-W accommodation faults. Small brittle-ductile strain zones developed in the planes of 

these accommodation faults and released the gold from the quartz vein, allowing gold concentration in 

the gangue of the adjacent carbonaceous phyllite, mainly in the hanging-wall. The F2 folding over the 

major quartz vein more greatly affected its basal contact in relation to post D2 overturning. This basal 



68 
 

 

contact is highly folded compared to its upper contact. S2 foliation is also more penetrative in the 

carbonaceous phyllite in the footwall of the major quartz vein. Gold mineralization therefore pre-dates 

D2, and is likely D1 or post D1, but has been significantly remobilized and enriched by F2 folding of 

D1 veins and host rock. D3 N-S compression generates the crenulation cleavage S3, which was 

identified only in drill holes at Ingá. The S3 crenulation cleavage partially rotates the F2 axis, 

producing microfolds that reorient mainly phyllosilicates. Apparently D3 did not affect the gold 

mineralization in the Ingá orebody, there is no evidence for gold related remobilization in the 

area/samples studied. The D4 event was not recognized at the Ingá orebody. 

The lack of structural evidence for deformation events that predate D1 in both the volcanic 

and sedimentary sections leads to the conclusion that D1 and D2 events occurred during the 

Paleoproterozoic (Rhyacian) 2170 ± 17 Ma (Jost et al., 2010). Hydrothermal fluids passing through 

the hanging-wall of the Ingá orebody, along S0 parallel to S1 in the dolomite sequence, leached and 

carried C, CaO, MgO, and MnO from the dolomites, whose subsequent precipitation pervasively 

altered the carbonaceous phyllite, originating the carbonatic alteration halo. This is confirmed by the 

major gains of C, CaO, MgO, and MnO and major losses in almost all other bulk oxides in the 

carbonatic zone of the carbonaceous phyllite. The diffuse contact between the dolomite sequence and 

the carbonaceous phyllite also provides strong evidence for this hydrothermal alteration event. This 

pervasive carbonatic alteration suggests a fluid of relative low temperature and alkaline pH due to the 

stability of carbonates. 

The selective phyllic halo occurs adjacent to the carbonatic zone. The halo originated from 

fluids with low to moderate temperatures and acidic character, with the potential to leach the host rock 

(Pirajno, 2009). Alteration substituted feldspars, micas, and mafic minerals to form phengitic 

muscovite and sericite along S1 foliation, sometimes forming locally massive concentrations. The 

ferri-biotite which characterizes the pervasive-selective potassic alteration always occurs over the 

phengitic muscovite in textural relations. Its occurrence is normally related to macroscopically gray-

yellow levels abruptly crosscutting the host rock. These level contacts are rarely diffuse. The potassic 

alteration, that occurs adjacent to the silicification halo, promoted the gain in K2O in the rock and loss 

of Fe and Mg from mafic minerals, assisted by fluids that usually have neutral to alkaline pH and 

elevated temperatures (Pirajno, 2009). Minor to major gains in K2O in altered GXN and GNCX 

reflect phyllic (phengitic muscovite and sericite) and potassic (ferri-biotite) alteration over the least 

altered host rock. 

Silicification, in particular, occurred during many events of fluid influx into the carbonaceous 

phyllite, from pre phyllic alteration to post-potassic alteration. However, a main post-potassic 

alteration event accounts for the bulk of silicification of the carbonaceous phyllite silicification halo. 

The least altered GXN and GNCX have a quartz-feldspatic matrix which, along with increase in FeO 

related to sulfides and CaO related to carbonate-rich venulations, mask the subsequent increase in 



69 
 

 

SiO2 content along the silicification alteration front. The silicification halo is formed from fluids with 

high temperatures that promote lixiviation of alkalis from the system (Pirajno, 2009). Due to the 

difference in pH and temperature conditions in the fluids, and paragenetic variations regarding 

mineralogy, it is attested that the participation of multiple fluids (at least two) was necessary in the 

gradative heterogenous hydrothermal system that formed the Ingá orebody. The Ingá orebody is 

therefore not a typical orogenic gold deposit, suggesting an external influence that is not totally 

understood. Two main fluids were important in the system, one with an acid pH and low to 

intermediate temperature and another with neutral to alkaline pH and high temperature. Late high 

temperature fluids did not totally erase the fabrics created by earlier low to intermediate temperature 

fluids. The chloritization of biotite and muscovite occurred along the retrograde metamorphic path at 

lower temperatures. The silicification halo thickness decrease along Ingá orebody plunge, as well as 

the thickness of the major quartz vein, which reflects less hydrothermal fluid carrying silica down 

plunge. The phyllic and potassic alteration haloes thicknesses, in contrast, increase. Undated later BCS 

and QGSS dikes crosscut the stratigraphic sequence. 

There is possibly an increase in fluid temperature in the thrust fault III plane. This increase in 

fluid temperature might be related to friction in the fault plane during hoarsening. The increase in fluid 

temperature that possibly occurred in the alteration and possible gold remobilization event from 

inferred invisible gold rich Aspy2 to form visible gold rich Aspy3 is in agreement with the increase in 

temperature towards the thrust fault III. This increase in temperature is also related to the evolving 

conditions of the hydrothermal fluids that formed the alteration haloes (e.g. elevated temperatures 

during potassic and silicification alteration). The formation of Aspy3 also implicated in reduced 

conditions, increased sulfur fugacity (fS2) and insignificant oxygen fugacity (fO2) variations. These 

conditions acting over Aspy2 possibly promoted a decrease in gold solubility, causing gold 

remobilization to Aspy3. The diversity of hydrothermal minerals and the extension of the alteration 

haloes suggest that the hydrothermal alterations were originated from high fluid/rock ratios, followed 

by a possible D2 remobilization event with low fluid/rock ratios. 

Conclusion 

The structural, mineralogical, and geochemical data set of this study provide an insight into 

the geologic history of the Ingá orebody Lower Zone. The orebody is composed, from top to bottom, 

by massive, brecciated, and laminated dolomite, followed by carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major 

crack and seal quartz vein (VQZ), quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist (GNCX), and metagraywacke 

with rare altered mafic dikes of biotite-chlorite schist (BCS) and quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) 

crosscutting the sequence. The Ingá orebody is structurally controlled by the thrust fault III (Structure 

III) and related shear zones. Compressive events D1, D2, and D3 affected the orebody configuration. 

During the retrograde metamorphic path, the hydrothermal alteration developed outwards from the 

Structure III and VQZ, affecting the GXN and GNCX. Hydrothermal alteration is characterized 



70 
 

 

outwards by silicification, potassic, phyllic, and carbonatic haloes. Different geochemical signatures 

clearly define these hydrothermal alteration haloes. The mineralization occurs in three different stages, 

mainly in the silicification zone, including: Pyrrhotite ± Pentlandite ± Arsenopyrite1 (Stage 1), 

Arsenopyrite2 (Stage II), Arsenopyrite3 ± Pyrrothite ± Chalcopyrite ± Ilmenite ± Rutile ± Magnetite ± 

Pentlandite ± visible Au (Stage III). Visible gold occurs mainly as free crystals in the basal levels of 

the VQZ, as free crystals in the GXN matrix, and rarely in rutile and pyrrhotite margins. The VQZ 

bearing gold vein probably had the bulk of the gold deposited in its basal levels by damming of 

mineralizing fluids during upward migration. Three types of arsenopyrite are texturally and 

geochemically identified: Aspy1 (early hydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible 

gold rich), and Aspy3 (later hydrothermal-remobilization). Visible gold also occurs as inclusions, 

filling fractures or along the margins of Aspy3. The whole-rock Bi ppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi 

ppm plots and major gains in As, Ni, and Co in the Aspy rich carbonaceous phyllite silicification zone 

may be used to identify potential Aspy3 and gold rich zones in carbonaceous phyllite host rock. These 

indicators should be used carefully due to the use of whole arsenopyrite crystals in the analysis. SEM 

and EMP backscattering imaging, SEM-EDS qualitative analysis, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS quantitative 

analysis to differentiate Aspy2 from Aspy3 rich host rock could be used by the exploration geologist 

but is discouraged: sample size is limited, analysis costs are high, and times for treatment are long.  

Possible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 

along late crystal fractures and selective alteration towards the margins occurred as a consequence of 

F2 folding. Possible remobilization and possible new deposition of visible gold substantially increased 

the orebody gold budget. The current microstructural setting of gold therefore masks a complex 

element mobility history that was linked to hydrothermal alteration and deformation, as suggested by 

microtextural and geochemical data. We conclude that late high temperature fluids did not totally 

erased the fabrics deposited by the earlier low to intermediate temperature fluids, and that the 

hydrothermal system at Ingá was gradative and heterogenous. This indicates that Ingá is not then a 

typical orogenic gold deposit. By now, a not totally understood external influence acted, encouraging 

new studies. Four prospective parameters for Ingá type orebodies in the Crixás Gold District were 

established: (1) major crack and seal quartz vein venulations in thrust fault planes and shear zones; (2) 

Aspy2 and Aspy3 in carbonaceous phyllite adjacent to major quartz vein and thrust fault; (3) E-W 

accommodation faults in the F2 folded major quartz vein and; (4) a silicification zone adjacent to the 

major quartz vein and thrust fault.
