ABSTRACT 
 
This work aimed to study the effect of vinasse on the biodegradation in soil of oily sludge from the Replan-Petrobras 
oil refinery. The Bartha respirometric method was used to verify the efficiency of the treatments with soil, oily 
sludge (7 and 14% m/m) and soil moisture adjustment with or without vinasse (0.11 mL/g dry soil) for 121 days. 
Although an increase in the soil microbial population was obtained with the vinasse, it demonstrated not to be 
adequate to enhance the biodegradation efficiency of the oily sludge in soil, since there was no difference between 
the CO2 produced from treatments with or without vinasse after the complete consumption of the vinasse. Thus, the 
use of vinasse as an amendment to biodegradation processes showed not to be efficient under the studied conditions.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The oil industry is responsible for the generation 
of high amounts of oily and viscous residues, 
which are formed during the production, 
transportation and refining. Such residues, called 
oily sludge, are basically composed of oil, water, 
solids, and their characteristics, such as varied 
composition, make their reutilisation very difficult, 
and confer on them high recalcitrance. Moreover, 
incineration of this residue is not recommended 
due to high energy costs, the potential risk of air 
pollution and the persistence of PAHs (Ururahy et 
al., 1998). Thus studies must be carried out aiming 

the improvement of the current suitable 
technologies or the development of new ones. 
The landfarming system is the most world-wide 
known technology used to treat the oily sludge. 
This system is designed to ensure the aerobic 
biodegradation of the residue in the soil superficial 
layer (Kataoka, 2001). However, this technology 
demands long process times and large areas and 
there is a potential risk of groundwater 
contamination if the landfarming is not well 
constructed. 
Due to the low biodegradation efficiency observed 
in the treatments where the oily sludge is mixed 
with soil (landfarming, biopile, and composting)

(Bossert et al., 1984; Mishra et al., 2001; Juteau et 
al., 2003; Ayotamuno et al., 2007;  Machín-
Ramírez et al., 2008), nutritional amendment is 
one of the possibilities to tackle this problem 
(Brown1   Hahn and Loehr, 1992; Chokshi and 
Nelson, 2003; Mrayyan and Battikhi, 2004). 
According to Ururahy et al. (1998), oily sludges 
possess limited amounts of nitrogen and 
phosphate, and most of the nitrogen is not 
available, since it is part of complex structures, 
relatively inaccessible to microorganisms.  
In Brazil, it is very common to dispose vinasse (a 
by-product of the alcohol distillation process with 
fertilisation characteristics) in agricultural fields, a 
process called ferti-irrigation, as a partial or total 
substitute for mineral fertilisers, mainly potassium. 
In general, to produce one litre of alcohol, 10 to 15 
litres of vinasse are produced, depending on sugar 
cane quality and the industrial process (Cortez et 
al., 1992), which corresponds to approximately 
170 billion litres per year of this residue in Brazil 
(Agrianual, 2004). 
Considering that the ethanol production in Brazil 
is in expansion due to a rising internal and world-

wide demand for alternative energy sources and 
that soils have a limited support capability to 
receive the vinasse, the search for additional 
application for the vinasse is very important. Thus, 
this work evaluated the potential use of vinasse as 
a biostimulation agent for the biodegradation of 
oily sludge in soil.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Oily sludge and vinasse characteristics 
The oily sludge was obtained from 
Replan/Petrobras oil refinery (Paulinia/SP/Brazil) 
prior to its disposal in the landfarming system. 
Vinasse was collected at Usina América 
(Assis/SP/Brazil). Tables 1 and 2 show the 
physicochemical characteristics of the oily sludge 
and vinasse, respectively. The analyses were 
performed by Icasa laboratory (Instituto 
Campineiro de Análise de Solo e Adubo – Icasa), 
according to the methodology proposed by 
Embrapa (1997).

Soil respirometric experiment 
The soil sample was collected from a loan area at a 
landfill in Rio Claro/SP/Brazil. Until performing 
the biodegradation experiment, the samples were 
stored at 5 oC. Table 3 summarises some 
physicochemical characteristics of the soil sample. 
The physicochemical analyses were performed by 
Icasa laboratory according to the methodology 
proposed by Embrapa (1997). In order to verify 
the influence of the vinasse in the biodegradation 
of the oily sludge, a batch biodegradation 
experiment (121 days) was carried out in Bartha 
biometer flasks (250 mL) used to measure the 
microbial CO2 production (Bartha and Pramer, 
1965; Régis and Bidoia, 2005; Inazaki et al., 2004; 
Mariano et al., 2008a-c and 2009b).  
Table 4 shows the treatments simulated in the 
respirometric experiments. The quantity of water 

or vinasse added to adjust the soil moisture to 
64.2% of the soil field capacity was 0.11 mL/g dry 
soil. For each treatment, the biometer flasks were 
prepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of soil) and 
incubated at 27 oC in the dark. The CO2 produced 
was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of KOH (0.2 
N), located in the side-arm of the biometer. This 
solution was periodically withdrawn by syringe, 
and the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed was 
then measured by titrating the residual KOH [after 
the addition of barium chloride solution (1 mL; 1.0 
N) used to precipitate the carbonate ions] with a 
standard solution of HCl (0.1 N). During this 
procedure, the biometers were aerated for 1.5 
minute through the ascarite filters. At the end of 
the experiment, replicates of each treatment were 
thoroughly mixed together for microbiological 
analysis.

Total heterotrophic bacteria and fungi were 
counted by using the pour plate technique on Plate 
Count Agar (PCA) and Potato Dextrose Agar 
(PDA + plus antibiotic), respectively. The plate 
counts were performed as follows: samples of 1 g 
of soil were added to 9 mL of 0.85 % sterile saline 
solution in test tubes and agitated mechanically for 
2 minutes. After appropriate serial dilutions, 1 mL 
of the suspension were spread over the surface of 
duplicate petri dishes and incubated for 48 h at 35 
oC (bacteria) or 28 oC (fungi). The total 
heterotrophic bacteria count was carried out at the 
beginning and at end of the respirometric 
experiment. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The daily CO2 productions in the respirometric 
experiment are represented in Figures 1 to 3, 
where each error bar represents one SD (standard 
 

deviation) of three replicates. The evolution of the 
CO2 production in treatment 2 (soil + vinasse) 
(Fig. 1) showed that the vinasse was practically 
totally biodegraded in approximately 40 days after 
being applied to the soil. When considering the 
treatments with oily sludge and vinasse (Fig.2 and 
3), a similar behaviour was observed, i.e. the CO2 
production in the treatments with vinasse initially 
differentiate from the controls and after similar 
period (40 days), it decreased until reaching values 
next to the controls. Thus, since there was no 
difference between the CO2 produced from the 
treatments with or without vinasse after the 
complete consumption of the vinasse, it showed 
that the vinasse did not biostimulate the 
biodegradation of the oily sludge at the 
mineralization level. It is important to emphasise 
that mineralization studies involving 
measurements of total CO2 production can provide 
excellent information on the biodegradability 
potential of hydrocarbons (Balba et al., 1998).

The microorganisms (total heterotrophic bacteria 
and fungi) counts carried out at the initial and final 
times of the respirometric experiment are shown in 
Figures 4 and 5. In almost all counts, the 
treatments with vinasse had a microbial population 
greater at the final time than the controls without 
vinasse. The exception was verified in the total 
heterotrophic bacteria count for treatments with an 
oily sludge concentration of 7 % (treatments 3 and 
4, Fig. 5). It indicated that generally vinasse had a 
positive effect on the soil microbial population, 
overcoming the toxicity of the oily sludge that 
could have negative effects on the microbiot, as 
observed by Mielniczuk (1991). 

The increase in the soil microbial population 
caused by the vinasse was also observed by Prata 
et al. (2001) and Mariano et al. (2009a) in their 
biodegradation experiments. However, as 
observed by Hickman and Novak (1989), the total 
microbial biomass could be a poor predictor for 
determining the biodegradation potential, mainly 
because the active biomass could differ in species 
composition and in metabolic regimes. Certainly 
these additional microorganisms preferentially 
biodegraded the more labile carbon sources as the 
glycerol present in the vinasse (Rodella et al., 
1983; Prata et al., 2001); otherwise, a marked 
decrease in the CO2 production after the 
consumption of the vinasse would not be 
observed.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Although an increase in the soil microbial 
population was obtained with the vinasse, it 
demonstrated not to be adequate to enhance the 
bioremediation efficiency of the oily sludge at the 
mineralization level. Thus, the use of vinasse as an 
amendment to biodegradation processes showed 
not to be efficient under the studied conditions.

RESUMO 
 
Este trabalho objetivou estudar o efeito da vinhaça 
na biodegradação em solo da borra oleosa 
proveniente da refinaria de petróleo Replan-
Petrobras. Foi utilizado o método respirométrico 
de Bartha para verificar a eficiência de tratamentos 
constituídos de solo, borra oleosa nas 
concentrações 7 e 14 % (m/m) e ajuste da umidade 
do solo com e sem vinhaça (0,11 mL/g solo seco)  
durante 121 dias. Embora a adição da vinhaça 
tenha proporcionado um aumento da população 
microbiana nos tratamentos, esta não se mostrou 
adequada para aumentar a eficiência de 
biodegradação da borra oleosa em solo, uma vez 
que não houve diferença entre o CO2 produzido 
nos tratamentos com ou sem vinhaça após o 
consumo total da vinhaça. Assim, o uso da vinhaça 
como agente estimulante em processos de 
biodegradação mostrou-se ineficiente nas 
condições estudadas.
