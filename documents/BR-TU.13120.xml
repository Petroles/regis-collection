Abstract: Ichnology is a powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary
paths of animal clades, through the paleobiology of behavior preserved in
Lagerstätten such as the Cabeço da Ladeira (Portugal) site. Here, the peritidal
carbonates of the Chão das Pias Formation (Middle Jurassic, upper Bajocian)
record the development of microbial mats in a tidal flat. Episodically, the
flat was expanded during periods of equinoctial spring tides that may have
been responsible for the in situ killing of several members of echinoderm
clades, and the fine preservation of their endoskeleton, in addition to the
behavior of an arthropod-dominated endo- and epifauna. Mat-preserved
shallow tiers with a moderate ichnodiversity attributed to the Cruziana
ichnofacies include trackways of crabs (Laterigradus lusitanica igen. nov.,
isp. nov.) and shrimps (Diplopodichnus isp.); trails of fishes (?Undichna),
gastropods (Archaeonassa fossulata), isocrinid crinoids (Krinodromos bentou
igen. nov., isp. nov.) and insects (Haplotichnus indianensis); and burrows
of shrimps or lobsters (Thalassinoides suevicus) and other arthropods
(Asterosoma ludwigae, Gyrochorte comosa), or polychaetes (Rhizocorallium
commune). This is implied already above (igen. nov., etc.) and seems not
needed. The crab trackways and gastropod bulldozing trails, extending up
to 12.3 m, are among the longest invertebrate cursorial traces ever found in
the fossil record. The mortichnial crawling trail of a crinoid is the first
evidence of locomotion for this group in the fossil record, and a rare
unambiguous example of this ethology. Extensive continuous trackways
attributed to amphibious crabs record, with great detail, typical gaits of
underwater punting and walking sideways on dry land. The earliest
evidences of sidewalking behavior may also be evidence for the development
of the crab form during their rise in the Jurassic.

Resumo: A Icnologia é um poderoso instrumento para a compreensão das
etapas evolutivas de clados de animais através da paleobiologia do
comportamento inscrito em sítios paleontológicos excepcionais, como o
Cabeço da Ladeira (Portugal). O Jurássico Médio (Bajociano superior) da
Formação de Chão das Pias é formado por uma sequência de carbonatos
peritidais que regista o desenvolvimento de tapetes microbianos numa
planície de maré. Episodicamente, esta terá tido um desenvolvimento
extraordinário através de marés equinociais que poderão ter sido responsáveis
pela morte in situ de diversos grupos de equinodermes e pela preservação
com excelente detalhe dos seus esqueletos articulados, além das formas de
comportamento de uma endo- e epifauna dominada pelos artrópodes. Os
níveis superficiais, com uma moderada icnodiversidade preservada pelos
tapetes microbianos e atribuível à icnofácies de Cruziana, incluem trilhos
de caranguejos (Laterigradus lusitanica nov. igén.) e de outros crustáceos
(Diplopodichnus isp.), assim como eventualmente de peixes (?Undichna),

pistas de gastrópodes (Archaeonassa fossulata), crinóides isocrinídeos
(Krinodromos bentou nov. igén.) e insectos (Haplotichnus indianensis), além
de galerias de lagostins ou de lagostas (Thalassinoides suevicus), e de outros
artrópodes (Asterosoma ludwigae, Gyrochorte comosa) ou poliquetas
(Rhizocorallium commune). Laterigradus lusitanicus e Krinodromos bentou
são novos icnogéneros e icnoespécies definidos neste trabalho. Os trilhos
de caranguejos e as pistas de gastrópodes são algumas das mais extensas
evidências de locomoção encontradas no registo fóssil dos invertebrados até
ao momento. A “marcha para a morte” de um crinóide é o primeiro registo
fóssil de locomoção para este grupo, e um raro exemplo desta categoria
etológica. Extensos trilhos contínuos também evidenciam com grande
detalhe os estilos de locomoção “salto com vara” subaquático e “caminhada
de lado” em terra emersa característicos dos caranguejos anfíbios. Os mais
antigos indícios da locomoção “de lado” poderão ser também a evidência
da evolução da forma de caranguejo com a diversificação dos Brachyura
durante o Jurássico, um clado bem-sucedido que culminou com a
colonização de habitats terrestres devido às suas exaptações motoras.

an organism are the result of internal physiological mechanisms
(demand) that are the by-product of a particular developmental
process depending on interactions between genotype and
environmental variables. However, even in completely different
groups of organisms, convergent behaviors are generated in an
equivalent pool of genetic solutions under similar environmental
conditions (universality sensu Barzel and Barabási, 2013).
Nevertheless, each animal species possesses its own neural
mechanism which, for pattern-selective processes, means subtle
differences in the mode of reaction to stimuli from related species.
On the other hand, behavior may evolve divergently when subjected
to different selection pressures through time. The substantial
modification of behavior due to constant adaptation to ecological
changes through time and coevolution, may generate a functional
change by aptation, if this increases reproductive success of the
species (Vermeij, 1987; Boucot, 1990). Biological behavior,
whenever preserved in the fossil record, was impacted by genetic
adaptations, by the original environmental and ecological
parameters, diagenetic overprints and even, in some ancient cases,
tectonic strain (Neto de Carvalho, 2011). Ichnology, the discipline
coping with the analysis of organism-sedimentary environment
interactions (description, classification and interpretation), is a
fundamental link between biological mechanisms and geological
processes (Plotnick, 2012). Trace fossils combine functional
morphology and behavior of producers, but also the physical-
chemical properties of the original environment-related substrate.
Only in remarkable examples of those, it is possible to obtain
substantial data on the ecology, functional morphology and behavior
that ultimately lead to detailed knowledge of the soft-bodied or
light-armored  (behavioral or behavior is spelled the American way
consistently producer. Therefore, ichnosites with an extraordinary
quality and quantity of ichnological information are known as
ichnolagerstätten (Savrda, 2007).

Recently, an exceptional new site was identified in the Middle
Jurassic of Portugal, and has been studied by a multidisciplinary
team. On about 4000 m2 quarry exposure, some of the longest and
continuous crawling trails and trackways ever described in the
invertebrate fossil record were found. Large numbers of fully-
articulated echinoderms are the most common macrofauna at this
site (Pereira et al., 2014a,b; Pereira, 2015). Both trace and body
fossils hold high paleobiological importance, due to their
remarkable fine preservation, age, rarity on rocks from similar age
and their high abundance. Cabeço da Ladeira records a shallow-tier
preservation of trackways and trails, and different echinoderm
clades in anatomical full- or semi-articulation, due to the presence
of extensive microbial mats whose evidences are also widespread
at the site (see below).

The aim of this paper is to report on various horizontal trace
fossils predominantly preserved on the bedding plane that are
present at the same beds as the well-preserved echinoderms. We
discuss their evolutionary and behavioral implications, namely the
acquisition of morphological exaptations that enabled new modes
of locomotion and ultimately, the colonization of new habitats. The
moderately diversified ichnoassemblage is composed mostly of
arthropod trackways, trails and burrows. They include the earliest
trackways indicating the presence of amphibious true crabs walking
sideways in the Middle Jurassic, very long and almost linear
bulldozing trails attributed to gastropods moving in the ebb tide,
and the very first locomotion trails left by stalked crinoids in the
fossil record. 

2. Stratigraphy of the Cabeço da Ladeira fossil site

The site of Cabeço da Ladeira is located about 2 km to the north of
the locality of São Bento, municipality of Porto de Mós, in the

Serras de Aires e Candeeiros Natural Park (Fig.1). This area lies
within a regional structure called Maciço Calcário Estremenho,
located in the central area of the Lusitanian Basin. The Lusitanian
Basin is located along the western Iberian margin and resulted from
extension related to the opening of the North Atlantic. The
sedimentary record of this rift basin is oriented NNE-SSW along
200 km and 100 km wide, with a maximum thickness of 4 to 5 km.
The Maciço Calcário Estremenho was uplifted by compressive
tectonic forces, associated with the Alpine Orogeny (Kullberg et al.,
2013). Its tectonic structure is generically divided into three elevated
regions separated by elongated fault-related depressions, cropping
out rocks from the Jurassic. The Lower Jurassic is restricted to
narrow salt walls where Hettangian evaporites occur. On the other
hand, the Middle Jurassic consists of bright colored limestones,
exposed on the top of the elevated regions. They were formed in
different paleoenvironments at a carbonate ramp depositional
system (inner ramp: Azerêdo, 1998, 2007). The Upper Jurassic is
characterized by limestones and marls, with colors varying from
brown to grey, appearing on tectonically controlled, depressed areas.
With the exception of the rocks in the vicinity of the main faults,
beds are sub-horizontal. The geosite Cabeço da Ladeira is within

one of those elevated structures, known as the Santo António
plateau, exposing rocks from the Middle Jurassic period. 

According to Azerêdo (2007), it is possible to observe, from the
base to the top, the Barranco do Zambujal Formation (Aalenian-
lower Bajocian), the Calcários de Vale da Serra Member (upper
Bajocian) from the Chão das Pias Formation and the Codaçal
Member (lower Bathonian) from the Santo António-Candeeiros
Formation. The Cabeço da Ladeira succession is exposing upper
Bajocian sediments from the Vale da Serra Member of the Chão das
Pias Formation (Sauzei biozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961). With a
thickness of 50-to-60 m, the sequence is formed by greyish yellow
marly limestones and clayish limestones (mudstone and wackestone
micrites and biomicrites with ammonoids and echinoderms) in the
lower part. Towards the top, a gradual transition to calciclastic and
dolomitic limestones, wackestone and packstone intrapelmicrites
and biopelmicrites occur (Azerêdo, 1998). The increasing
intercalation, from east to west and from the base of the sequence

Trackways from the Mid Jurassic of Cabeço da Ladeira 41

to its upper part, of dolomitized oobioclastic, massive dolomite and
dolomite laminated levels, testimony a regressive trend in facies,
with progradation of shallower conditions with microbial-algal mats
(Azerêdo et al., 2003).

At the quarry, the succession is composed of seven different cm-
scale limestone beds (Fig. 2) deposited under very shallow subtidal-
to-intertidal conditions, with episodic short-term aerial exposure
without evidence for the development of soils. Newly exposed rock
has a white to beige color, but acquires a dark grey and yellow-to-
orange color due to the exposure to weathering agents and the
growth of lichens. Thin clay layers are also present between some
of these limestone layers and filling some epichnial trails. The rocks,
mostly limestones, range from mudstone to wackstone, with a
variable component of peloids, bioclasts and intraclasts (Fig. 3). 

The clast size varies between and within layers. Intralayer
variations are often very sharp and associated with erosion surfaces.
Erosion surfaces and truncations are also quite evident, with a
normal grading. Laterally, grain size can vary rapidly. Nevertheless,
it is possible to observe a slight decrease in layer thickness and
overall grain size towards the top of the section. On the upper
surface of some limestone layers there are beautifully preserved
ripple marks. These ripples occupy a significant area of this locality,
being separated in two groups, with parallel or anastomosing crests
(Fig. 3A). The parallel ripples appear to have symmetric sides, and
are mostly oriented NNW-SSE. Microbial-mat-related structures
(Seilacher, 2008; Noffke, 2010) are abundant, represented by a
lower, mineral-rich layer: big wrinkle structures are preserved in
bed 6 (Fig. 3G) and palimpsest, multidirectional ripples are found
in bed 2; elephant skin, mud (mat) chips, “foam” structures and
shrinkage cracks are spread all over the fine iron-rich laminate
levelling structures that partially covers long trackways in bed 3
(Fig. 3D). The recurrent presence of microbial mat-related structures
in the sequence shows that the deposition took place in very shallow
conditions of the carbonate mudflat. However, echinoderms are
abundant and indicative of subtidal environments. Nevertheless,
sudden environmental changes were responsible for their death
mostly in life position and the preservation of almost intact
articulated skeletons (Fig. 3A). Rill marks cut the microbial mat
structures and cross the ripple marks in mainly SW direction. They
are good indicators of the lower foreshore above the low tide (Fig.
3H). Deep-imprinted trails and trackways crossing the mudflat show
episodes of aerial exposure that may have been related to spring
tides that periodically exposed wider areas from the lower intertidal-
upper subtidal. Growth of biomats usually occurs in harsh and
hypersaline environments uninhabitable for most burrowing
organisms (Knaust et al., 2012) and therefore provides excellent
substrate conditions, through the formation of leathery semi-rigid
top layers, for survivorship and preservation of those delicate
trackways (De, 2014; Fig. 3F) and shallow-tiered burrows.

More than a hundred echinoderm specimens have been
identified at this locality, with the potential for increasing the
number (Pereira, 2015). The echinoderms appear more or less
scattered evenly throughout the exposed rock area. All seven beds
exposed in the quarry are bioturbated, and beds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 have
echinoderm fossils. So far, beds 5 and 6 did not yield any echinoderm
fossils. However, the exposed area of these two layers is substantially
smaller than the other beds, so they may also contain fossils. In the
vast majority of the cases, echinoderms are preserved semi-
articulated, with rare cases of isolated spines and disassociated
plates of echinoids. In many cases, only the external molds of
echinoderms are present, with the actual fossil no longer present
either due to erosion or rock quarrying activity. The echinoderm
fossils found on that site belong to four distinct echinoderm classes
(by order of abundance): the Echinoidea, including Heterocidaris
sp. nov., Stomechinus bigranularis (Lamarck, 1816), Stomechinus

sp., ?Gymnodiadema hessi Smith, 2011, Paracidaris spinulosa
(Cotteau, 1875) and Rhabdocidaris spp.; the Asteroidea, with
Noviaster sp. nov. and indetermined goniasterid; the Crinoidea,
showing few isocrinid and possible ?comatulid representatives; and
Ophiuroidea indet. (Pereira, 2015). Along with fossil echinoderms,
rare bivalves and brachiopods are also present. The extraordinary
preservation of these echinoderms, which are not commonly
resistant to post-mortem processes, is typically associated with high
sedimentary rates and rapid burial, as well as little transport (Baumiller
et al., 2008).

Following the observations of Mángano and Buatois (2004) for
bioturbation in tidal flats, the Bajocian open-marine tidal flat of
Cabeço da Ladeira developed on a carbonate ramp characterized
by: 1) moderate ichnodiversity; 2) marine trace and body fossils of
stenohaline forms, such as echinoderms and the elements of the
Cruziana ichnofacies; 3) the presence of both infaunal (burrows)
and epifaunal traces (trackways and trails); 4) the presence of both
trophic generalists (Archaeonassa) and specialists (Thalassinoides,
Asterosoma); 5) the dominance of horizontal trace fossils of the
Cruziana ichnofacies, such as Thalassinoides, Rhizocorallium and
Gyrochorte; 6) the presence of multispecific ichnoassociations; 7)
the high levels of bioturbation, especially for Thalassinoides and
Archaeonassa; and 8) the wide size range, as can be found for small
and large types of Thalassinoides.

The remarkable preservation of trackways may be explained by
stress factors that may have isolated the mixed layer from subsequent
bioturbation (Pirrie et al., 2004). The associated ichnofauna shows
the common development of firmgrounds in a shallow-tiered
Glossifungites-type ichnofacies (MacEachern et al., 1992).

Trackways from the Mid Jurassic of Cabeço da Ladeira 43

3. The earliest sideways walking crab trails

3.1 Evidences for a crab-form tracemaker and the evolution of

sideways locomotion

The Cabeço da Ladeira site possesses a remarkable preservation of
very long trackways and trails crossing the microbial-mat related
structures and ripple-marks that cover some of the beds, especially
beds 2 and 3. Trackways represent single and fast excursions across
the tidal flat by a multi-legged animal. The longest one measures
12.30 m and may be the longest fossil invertebrate trackway known
in the world (Fig. 4A,B; see below). The trackway slightly curves
along its course. It is composed by sets of up to four footprints,
externally measuring 65 mm wide (Fig. 4C). Footprints are pit- to
sigmoid-shaped, 3 to 25 mm long, showing different preservational
conditions and depths related with heteropody (Seilacher, 2008).
Along the trackway sets of up to twelve prints sometimes occur,
forming a circular pattern that can be interpreted as probing behavior,
through the use of sharp dactyls for chemoperception (sensu Schäfer,
1972; Fig. 4D). Together with the four-footprint sets, the stride lengths
of 40-80 mm and metachronal gait clearly suggest an aerial style of
locomotion. Based on the evidences presented, these trackways were
most likely made by an amphibious decapod crustacean
morphologically adapted for walking and running sideways (Fig. 5).

In the morphology of decapod crustaceans, thorax elongation is the
most important feature, together with leg length, lateral flattening and
placement at rest, to reflect the walking preference (Vidal-Gadea et al.,
2008). The most successful evolutionary trend of crabs and some crab-
like anomurans (e.g., Porcellanidae) was the progressive reduction of
the long and vulnerable abdomen, which reduces drag and greatly
hinders faster locomotion, alongside the inflexion of the reduced
abdomen against the sternum (Förster, 1985), which favored the
development of the crab form and sideward locomotion. Supported by
phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, and gene rearrangements,
Morrison et al. (2002) suggested that the evolution of the crab-like form
and, therefore walking sideways, had five independent origins in
bottom-dwelling crustacean decapods, the most successful one in the
Brachyura, and four others in the Anomura (Porcellanidae, Paguroidea,
Coenobitoidea and Lomis). Sideward walking provided crabs the
unique advantage of being equally fast in opposite directions through
increasing multilegged stride length (Vidal-Gadea et al., 2008).
Actually, the ecological dispersion of brachyurans to land habitats may
have been aided by the use of sideways octopedal locomotion (Full and
Herreid, 1984). Not all brachyuran crabs can walk sideways. In such
gait, pairs of the four leading limbs are used in combination with
alternating pairs of trailing limbs, which may result in longer, sigmoidal
imprints in the substrate. The leg joints articulate along consecutively
perpendicular planes. This possibly was an exaptation for the evolution
of walking sideways (Vidal-Gadea et al., 2008).

The main trail attributed to gastropods (Fig. 4) is followed at
least for half of its length by a crab trackway more than 4 m long
and 65 mm wide. This trackway is composed of sets of 2-3
elongated footprints with a stride length of 140-170 mm (Fig. 4G).
Besides this example, there are at least two more trackways in
Cabeço da Ladeira showing evidence of a punting gait under water
(sensu Martinez et al., 1998; see Fig. 9G). Crabs walking sideways
experience drag forces perpendicular to their longitudinal axis. On
land, crabs never have fewer than three legs in contact with the
ground at any time. Drag forces are partially offset by lifting forces
underwater due to buoyancy. Thus, legs touch the bottom less
frequently moving under water compared to locomotion on land, as
observed during lab experiments by Martinez et al. (1998). In
underwater punting locomotion, only 2-3 legs are in contact with
the ground at any time and leg kinematics is much more variable
than on land. This thrust and gliding motion can be clearly followed
in some of the Cerro da Ladeira trackways (Fig. 4G, 5).

The crab trackways and the crawling trails attributed to
gastropods show the same orientation of the rill marks perpendicular
to the rippled microbial mat surface. According to the asymmetry
of the imprints in the longest trackway, the crab may have walked
in the opposite direction of the tide. The substantial depth of the
footprints, the use of at least four legs in walking or running, and
the carcasses of many echinoderms also suggest the aerial exposure
of the flat during a low tide. Several faint parallel trackways were
also found under the microbial-mat layer (Fig. 4). In some places
of the tidal flat it is possible to find circular mounds with a central
crater measuring 28-50 mm in diameter (Fig. 4E). These may be
interpreted as simple crab burrows used to protect the crab during
the low tide cycle, as we can find nowadays for the Similar-sized
side-runner Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758) (Fig. 4F). The Green
crab is active during high tide, foraging on prey and grazing the
algal and microbial mats that develop at the sediment surface (Baeta
et al. 2006; CNC, pers. obs.). During low tide, they look for protection
from predators and dehydration in simple burrows excavated by the
leading limbs, using the wedge-shaped carapace to shovel the
sediment above them. These transient burrows are abandoned every
time they feel endangered after which a new one is built. However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that these mounds may be related
with the Thalassinoides producer, whose burrow mazes are also
common in the succession.

This study implements previous works on the application of
ichnology for understanding the evolution of crustaceans (Baucon et
al., 2014). This shows that trace fossils with a distinctive bioprint
(Kopaska-Merkel and Rindsberg, 2015) are useful for interpreting the
evolutionary history of organisms with a relatively low preservation
potential, such as arthropods with lightly mineralized exoskeletons.

3.2 The earliest evidences of true crabs

The Early and Middle Jurassic fossil record of crabs is not very rich.
Using molecular phylogenetics, Tsang et al. (2014) suggested that
Brachyura, as its sister group Anomura, would have been present
together over 180 Ma ago. The superfamily Majoidea has the oldest
lineage diverging 254 Ma ago, according to Porter et al. (2005), but
the oldest majoid fossils thus far are only mid-Cretaceous (late
Albian) in age (Klompmaker, 2013). Divergence time estimates for
Brachyura by Tsang et al. (2014) are more conservative and suggest
around 170-171 Ma. Nevertheless, the first brachyurans in the fossil
record appeared in the Lower Jurassic (Pliensbachian; see
Schweitzer and Feldmann, 2010; Haug and Haug, 2014). Krobicki
and Zatón (2008) suggested that the evolution of prosopid crabs
apparently began in Early Jurassic on shallow, soft bottom marine
environments. Brachyuran diversification started slowly during the
Middle Jurassic (Müller et al., 2000; Klompmaker et al., 2013). No
crab species are known from the Toarcian or Aalenian. The earliest
crabs living in the subsequent Bajocian times were Pithonoton,
Eodromites, Gabriella, Tanidromites, Abyssophthalmus, Planoprosopon,
Eoprosopon and Foersteria, all based on European occurrences.
While most of them have elongated carapaces and most likely walked
forward, members of the genus Pithonoton show an ovoid or sub-
pentagonal carapace that that may suggest a sideward locomotion.
However, one of the largest Jurassic crab, Eodromites grandis (von
Meyer, 1857) hardly exceeds 30 mm (dataset, Klompmaker et al.,
2015), which is significantly small to have produced the observed
trackways. In the Lusitanian Basin, the earliest record of brachyuran
body fossils thus far occurs much later in the Late Jurassic (mid-
Oxfordian; Mateus et al., 2013).

Reports of fossil brachyurans preserved in situ with their trace
fossils are limited to the longusorbiid Longusorbis cuniculosus
(Richards, 1975) from the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian
of British Columbia, Canada (Richards, 1975); Icriocarcinus xestos

Trackways from the Mid Jurassic of Cabeço da Ladeira 45

(Bishop, 1988) from the upper Campanian or lower Maastrichtian
of California, USA (Bishop, 1988), the carpiliid crabs from the
Oligocene of Kachchh, Gujarat, India (Gurav and Kulkarni, 2016),
and the goneplacid Ommatocarcinus corioensis (Cresswell, 1886)
from the lower Miocene-Pliocene of Australia (Jenkins, 1975). The
scarcity of fossil crabs is well-known, when compared to heavier
calcified taxa. They are frequently overlooked and, mostly because
they are rarely preserved in coastal and nearshore facies and are far
less abundant in pre-Late Jurassic sequences (Stempien, 2005;
Klompmaker et al., 2013). By the Bathonian times, amphibious
crab-like animals may have been producing burrows in gregarious
populations within supralittoral breccias-conglomerate and littoral
in a closed and shallow, low-salinity to freshwater coastal-lagoon
setting, attributed to the Psilonichnus Ichnofacies (Marshall, 2003).
These trace fossils found in NW Scotland could potentially provide
the earliest known record of crab activity and their physiological
adaptation to survive in a semi-terrestrial environment. The
explosive adaptive radiation of the short-tailed crab-like type took
place in the Late Jurassic (Förster, 1985). Rapid diversification of
mostly reef-swelling crabs during the Late Jurassic coincided with a
major expansion of reefs (Klompmaker et al., 2013). The remarkable
findings described for Cabeço da Ladeira, Portugal, of crab trackways
produced on an emerged tidal flat may push the evolution of true crabs
with amphibious adaptations into the Middle Jurassic (late Bajocian).

4. Among the longest invertebrate trackways and trails

At Cabeço da Ladeira there are several meter-long trackways
attributed to crabs, trails that may be attributed to fishes (see below)
and simple and straight furrows that may be compared with
gastropod trails common to tidal flats. These latter trails consist of
a central, flat furrow bordered by two narrow parallel ridges and
almost vertical boundaries (Baucon, 2008; Fig. 6A). Two of the
trails end in an elliptical-shaped pit (Fig. 6B). These burrows are

oriented towards the coastline and may be interpreted as if the
producer looked for protection from dehydration or the phreatic
level to keep the gills moist. The trail depth and sharpness may
suggest that the animal was grazing the microbial mat during
emersion episodes, cutting through the rippled surface by bulldozing
the sediments in straight lines perpendicular to the estimated
coastline (Fig. 6C). Gastropods are relatively slow crawlers (e.g.,
Vermeij, 1987, and  references herein). Following the shortest distance
to water would significantly reduce the time exposed to the elements
and predators. However, there are also more sinuous long trails
showing the same bulldozing behavior (Fig. 6D). In fact, most of
Archaeonassa occur as shallow epichnia, most of them covered with
a thin veneer of white clay, and they are among the most common
trace fossils in Cabeço da Ladeira stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 6F).
Several long trails perpendicularly cut the ripples, paralleling others
and seem to burrow under the stiff microbial mat leaving partially
exposed tunnels behind (Fig. 6E). According to Mángano and Buatois
(2015), Archaeonassa fossulata (Fenton and Fenton, 1937) may
represent matground grazing of a microbially enriched surface. On
the other hand, mat growth may progressively cover any trail or
trackway crossing the flat. 

Measuring 12.3 m Laterigradus lusitanica igen. nov., isp. nov.
attributed to a crab trackway may be the longest described for
invertebrates in the fossil record. Also the gastropod trails, straight or
sinuous, are extremely long and continuous and can be followed by
up to 11.5 m (Figs. 4A, 6A). Other examples of extensive invertebrate
trackways in the literature are surprisingly rare. Lomax and Racay
(2012) described a 9.7 m mortichnial trackway produced by
Mesolimulus walchi in the lower Tithonian of the Solnhofen
Lithographic Limestone. The longest fossil invertebrate trackway was
claimed by De (2014), for a 10 m long crab trackway from the Eocene
Mithakhari Group of Andaman island, and he provided a review of
the longest invertebrate repichnia in the literature. However, some
examples of very long trails and trackways may have not been taken
into consideration in the review of De (2014), such as the very long
trails attributed to Climactichnites wilsoni Logan, 1860, from the
Middle-to-Late Cambrian of Blackberry Hill, Wisconsin, studied in
detail for the last 20 years (Gass, 2015). Thus we may claim the
continuous trackways and trails found at the Middle Jurassic of
Cabeço da Ladeira are among the longest described in the fossil
record. Apart from the relative interest that size may have for
ichnology, continuous long trackways provide comprehensive
information about behavioral variations from the general pattern
related to ecospace heterogeneity (hydrodynamics, water depth and
aerial exposure, substrate firmness, food distribution, etc.). 

5. The first trail of a stalked crinoid in the fossil record

In the tidal flat of Cabeço da Ladeira, a stalked form of crinoid was
found at the end of its trail (Fig. 7). Its course can be followed from
a microbial mat patch identified by wrinkle structures. There, it
shows the disruption of the mat around a shallow pit surrounded by
small piles of broken sediment. The trail is very faint and large at
the beginning, becoming sharper and as wide as the crinoid later on
(Fig. 7A; Fig. 8 for photogrammetric interpretation). It consists of
a flat to slightly disturbed central area resulting probably from stalk
dragging. This central area is surrounded by two large and irregular
furrows limited externally by ridges of sediment. The two large
furrows were produced by the articulated moving arms of the
crinoid in loose sediment. All the arms and cirri are bending
backwards in locomotion position. 

The columnal ossicles have more of less the same thickness
throughout the length of the stalk. The cirri are present throughout
the stalk, more or less regularly spaced, long, slender and ending on
a little hook. Little is known about the calyx, appearing to be short

to the ripple marks; only a section is represented to show the transition from aerial
sideways running, with three to four long-shaped imprints, to an underwater punting
gait where just two limbs are used, leaving circular pits behind. A – 2D orthophotography;

and conical. The arms branch quite close to the calyx. The brachials
appear to be massive. The preservation of the pinnules is poor,
appearing to be relatively short. The presence of a stalk and the
arrangement of the cirri along it suggest that these specimens belong
to the order Isocrinida. This isocrinid trail is the only one of its kind
found at Cabeço da Ladeira.

Isocrinid crinoids have a sessile life. Active crawling by stalked
crinoids, a group generally thought to be sessile, was only recently

demonstrated (Baumiller and Messing, 2007). This study reveals
that isocrinids could relocate by crawling with their arms, dragging
the stalk behind them. However, the locomotion behavior of
crinoids was never described from the fossil record. Speed is related
to the length of the arms involved in the power stroke (Baumiller
and Messing, 2007). The ability to detach the stalk and crawl may
have evolved as escape strategy from benthic predators. Cidaroid
echinoids occur in the same bed where the isocrinid crinoid trail

was found, and have been documented to prey on this kind of
crinoids. The observed trace and maker suggest that this strategy
might have been used by shallow-water crinoids to cope with
sudden environmental changes, or instances of an abnormal low
tide, which may have been the reason for the trail made by the
crinoid at Cabeço da Ladeira. Several features that are necessary
for crawling have been identified (Messing et al., 1988; Baumiller
and Messing, 2007): a detachable stalk; some mode of reattachment
of the stalk to the substrate, such as flexible cirri; and arms that are
both flexible and strong enough to generate the power and recovery
strokes to pull the animal along the bottom.

The elbow-crawling behavior may be described as the stalk
being dragged behind the crown along the substrate, with the
proximal part nearly horizontal. In this posture, only a portion of
the strongly aborally flexed arms are in contact with the substrate
(Baumiller and Messing, 2007), as we can see in the Middle Jurassic
trail (Fig. 7B). In the power stroke, the arm base bends away from
the mouth, pushing the more strongly flexed arm tip down and
backward against the substrate. With the tide retreating and the flat
being exposed, the crinoid had more difficulty in keeping the stalk
uplifted and dragged it on the bottom. The result is expressed as the
sharpening of the crawling effort, also due to dehydration of the
sediment, and the piles of sediment pushed away by the arms’
movement (Fig. 8). The trail becomes also more winding near the
crinoids' final resting place. This is a fine example of a mortichnion:
the isocrinid crinoid was caught by low tide in its death march
(Seilacher, 2008). Examples of mortichnia are rare and some have

been questioned recently (Vallon et al., 2015, 2016), but this find
unequivocally confirms the validity of this ethological category.   

6. Systematic ichnology

Ichnogenus Laterigradus igen. nov.

Diagnosis: Asymmetric trackway formed by up to four tracks
distributed in discrete sets that may show different stride lengths
adapted to distinct cursorial gaits expressed in water or land.

Laterigradus lusitanica isp. nov.
(Figs. 4, 5)

Etymology: Laterigradus comes from Latin and refers to the
sideways steps; lusitanica indicates the territory of the Lusitani tribe
that lived in Central Portugal before the expansion of the Roman
Empire to Iberia; it gave also the name to the Lusitanian Basin.

Type locality and age: Cabeço da Ladeira, included in the Vale da
Serra Member of the Chão de Pias Formation, upper Bajocian (Sauzei
biozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961); Maciço Calcário Estremenho (Lusitanian
Basin, Portugal) coordinates: 8°47’57.307”W, 39°32’39.108”N.

Material: Numerous examples of such trackways in beds 4 to 6
of Cabeço da Ladeira site. The holotype is the longest and the best
preserved trackway. A cast of the total length of this trackway was
made and stored at the Geological Museum of Lisbon, number
MG30474.

Diagnosis: The same as for the ichnogenus. Uniserial trackways
with sets of up to four circular-to-sigmoidal tracks.

Remarks: This is a repichnion of crab-form decapods, most
probably an brachyuran revealing a sideward locomotion. The
trackways are straight to gently curved trackways and may reveal
different stride lengths and number of tracks according to an
underwater punting or octopedal walking gaits on land. The deepest
part of dactyl imprints is located in the opposite direction to the
locomotion, thus providing the direction of movement. The
concentration of footprints in the trackway shows changes in speed
of probing the sediment. The relatively low density of trackways
shows that the crab producers were not gregarious, but territorial
with large feeding areas in the flat.

Remarkably, there are few trackway ichnotaxa attributed to
crustaceans. Pirrie et al. (2004) described the ichnogenus
Foesterichnus rossensis, from the Coniacian Hidden Lake Formation,
at James Ross Island, Antarctica, and revised the trackway fossil
record of crustaceans. The diagnosis of the ichnogenus includes
straight or curving trackways composed of paired rows of elongate
to tear-shaped impressions, organized in series of three and four
imprints. They clearly evidence forward walking of brachyuran crabs,
and they were the first formally described and attributed to this group
from the fossil record (Pirrie et al., 2004). As Laterigradus lusitanicus
evidences a different locomotory, sideways walking and running
behavior, that also has morphological implications for the crab-form
producer responsible for them, we think it is useful to erect a new
ichnogenus to include asymmetric trackways of brachyuran crabs.

Ichnogenus Krinodromos igen. nov.

Diagnosis: Trails composed of a narrow and flat central area with
an irregular winding furrow, or almost no sedimentary disruption,
bordered by shallow and large grooves externally limited by
irregular piles of sediment.

Krinodromos bentou isp. nov.
(Figs. 7, 8)

Etymology: Krinodromos comes from the Greek “the course of the
[sea] lily”; bentou refers to the closest village, S. Bento, close to which
is located the quarry where the crinoid crawling trace was found.

48 C. Neto de Carvalho et al. / Comunicações Geológicas (2016) 103, Especial I, 39-54

Type locality and age: Cabeço da Ladeira, included in the Vale
da Serra Member of the Chão de Pias Formation, upper Bajocian
(Sauzei biozone; Ruget-Perrot, 1961); Maciço Calcário Estremenho
(Lusitanian Basin, Portugal): coordinates: 8°47’57,307”W,
39°32’39,108”N.

Material: The holotype and only example was found with an
isocrinid crinoid at its very end, which makes the attribution of the
trail to a tracemaker much easier. A cast was made and stored at the
Geological Museum of Lisbon, number MG30475.

Diagnosis: The same as for the ichnogenus.
Description: Very faint irregular trail with planar central area,

or disrupted by an irregular curving furrow and bordered by two
shallow, wide and irregular grooves that are limited by piles of
sediment. The trail is mostly straight but narrows and curves
abruptly (c. 50º) where the crinoid body fossil rests, becoming
impressed more sharply (Fig. 8). 

Remarks: Being a shallow and irregular trail, it is not easy to
compare Krinodromos bentou to other examples from the fossil
record if found without the associated producer. This trail is
probably rare because we interpret this as an unusual locomotion
on land resulting from flat exposure that ultimately caused the death
of the crinoid. The most conspicuous ichnotaxobases that
characterizes Krinodromos bentou are the two bordering grooves
combined with pushed sediment piles, and a central flat area or a
narrow winding furrow, depending on the firmness of the substrate.
This trail can be explained as mortichnion of an isocrinid. In an
abnormally low tide the crinoid crawled away from the microbial
mat where it was anchored in a vertical hole surrounded by sediment
pustules resulting from the effort to become free. The crinoid used
sets of arms to create a bilateral symmetric locomotion by flexing
the arms backwards pushing the sediment laterally, causing irregular
piles. The bending termination of the trail could represent the climax
of a stressed condition that coincided with the aerial exposure of the
flat and the death of the crinoid. The animal was simply not fast
enough to reach the water line. The width of the trace is similar to
the width of the crinoids’ bending arms in the final part, suggesting
that it was produced as the body was dragged by the appendages
throughout the sediment (Fig. 8). 

Archaeonassa fossulata Fenton and Fenton, 1937
(Fig. 6)

Description: Unilobed narrow trails, having a median groove
flanked by ridges, less than 10 mm to up to 40 mm wide. The trails
can be winding or gently meandering, and linear. The longest linear
trail is unilobed and can be followed for 11.2 m and is 20 mm wide.
It is bordered by sediment ridges. Another long trail, measuring 8.4
m long and 20 mm wide, possesses an elliptical-shaped hole at one
of the ends.

Remarks: These traces match the morphology of A. fossulata
reviewed by Buckman (1994) and Yochelson and Fedonkin (1997).
It is generally understood as recording the grazing behavior of
gastropods. Archaeonassa may also be produced by preying
gastropods (Baucon and Felletti, 2013a, 2013b).

Diplopodichnus isp.
(Fig. 9A)

Description: Two parallel grooves 1-3 mm wide, each in a straight,
but mostly winding course, formed by discrete footprints or
overlapping ones developing linear furrows. Prints are circular or
elongated perpendicular to the trail course. 

Remarks: These kinds of trails were described by Baucon
(2008) as produced by the pereiopod prints and the dragging tail of
mud shrimps. These axiidean shrimps are active during the low tide,
grazing the algae and bacteria that develop at the sediment surface

(see Baucon, 2008, and references therein). Diplopodichnus are
usually filled with sediment and cut by gastropod grazing trails,
which indicates that these trackways were produced underwater.
Axiideans, notably Axiidae, have a fossil record into the Early
Jurassic (e.g., Hyžný and Klompmaker, 2015).

Gyrochorte comosa Heer, 1865
(Fig. 9B)

Description: Winding bilobed burrows in convex epirelief, 4-18 mm
wide, preserved as plaited ridges with bisserially arranged, chevron-
shaped pads of sediment, separated by a median furrow.

Remarks: This is a burrow typical for the Cruziana Ichnofacies,
produced within the sediments in a subtidal environment. The
producer may be a polychaete-like worm (e.g., Heinberg, 1973).
However, the method of sediment transport and locomotion
represented in Gyrochorte fit the physiology of an arthropod much
better (see Schlirf, 2000). 

Haplotichnus indianensis Miller, 1889
(Fig. 9C)

Description: Simple half-cylindrical trail, unbranched and
horizontal, needle-like in size, running in straight or crooked lines,
or crossing itself (Rindsberg and Kopaska-Merkel, 2005). 

Remarks: Haplotichnus is interpreted to be the work of insects
(Rindsberg and Kopaska-Merkel, 2005). The sharp turns are
significant because short-bodied animals such as arthropods can
change direction more easily than long-bodied worms. Due to its
geotechnical properties, the mat is a protective environment for
delicate juvenile insect forms. According to the observations of
Baucon (2008), larvae of Diptera behave as undermat miners by
excavating very shallow burrows parallel to the mat surface. The
upper organic-rich layer would provide abundant nutrients and, at
the same time, it guaranteed protection from predators and physical
disturbance (Baucon, 2008), while the burrow was produced in the
mineral-rich layer with microbial mat related structures. 

Asterosoma ludwigae Schlirf, 2000
(Fig. 9D)

Description: Asterosoma with linear or curved elipsoidal bulbs,
those seem to develop from an axial horizontal burrow. Bulbs are
loosely grouped following the axial burrow that is in a lower level
so bulbs are oblique and rise from the bedding plane. Burrow
surface contains scratch marks and burrow fill is similar to the host
bed. 

Remarks: Asterosoma occurs in the same bed of Thalassinoides
suevicus, with convex epirelief preservation. These burrows form
the deepest tier in the ichnofabric, and were developed in subtidal
conditions. They may share the same producer, in accordance with
Neto de Carvalho and Rodrigues (2007).

Thalassinoides suevicus Rieth, 1932
(Fig. 9E)

Description: Burrow meshworks with unlined burrow walls, smooth
lining, branching predominantly dichotomous, Y- to T- shaped
typically enlarged at points of bifurcation. Sizes of T. suevicus differ
between 7 and 40 mm in diameter.

Remarks: These burrows represent three-dimensional boxworks.
Bed 4 is extensively bioturbated by small examples of Thalassinoides.
Common intergradations between Thalassinoides suevicus and
Spongeliomorpha Saporta, 1887, have been repeatedly described in
the literature (see references in Schlirf, 2000). Outer burrow scratch
marks are the result of digging in a firm substrate. The proposed
producers of both size-scaled Thalassinoides could be small Axiidea

and Gebiidea shrimps or lobsters (Neto de Carvalho et al., 2007).
Ghost shrimps inhabit predominantly intertidal and subtidal marine
environments at tropical and subtropical latitudes, but their body
fossil record goes back to Lower Cretaceous only (Hyžný and
Klompmaker, 2015). 

Rhizocorallium commune Schmid, 1876
(Fig. 9F)

Description: U-shaped spreiten burrows nearly parallel to the
bedding plane; limbs are parallel and distinct.
Remarks: Rhizocorallium is rare in the Cabeço da Ladeira section,
and occurs with abundant T. suevicus in bed 5. The ichnogenus
Rhizocorallium was recently revised by Knaust (2013), who
resumed to two valid ichnospecies, R. jenense and R. commune. The
producer in this case is unknown, as Rhizocorallium-behavior may
be produced by different worm and arthropod organisms. For
Knaust (2013), the most likely producers for marine Rhizocorallium
are polychaetes, based on their long-ranging occurrence,
morphological features, associated body-fossil remains, and modern
analogues. However Meyer (1988) cited the axiid Protaxius within
Rhizocorallium. The common observation of scratch marks in the
walls of R. commune in firmgrounds from different age across the
Lusitanian Basin led Neto de Carvalho et al. (2010) and Mateus et
al. (2013) to attribute this ichnospecies to the feeding behavior of
crustaceans.

?Undichna isp.
(Fig. 9G,H)

Description: Trackways made of continuous, four or more, parallel
furrows, 1-3+ m long in sets 70-100 mm wide. Grooves are mostly
linear or curvilinear, or slightly sinusoidal. One of them is at least
3.2 m long and ends with a very shallow, resting trace with a
crescent shape similar to the recently described Crescentichnus by
Romano and White (2015) (Fig. 9H).

Remarks: Undichna is interpreted to be a fish-fin or fish-swimming
trail left as an impression on the substrate (Trewin, 2000). They may
have been produced during the low tide, when the water was retreating
from the flat. Sets of grooves are usually sinusoidal with different
wavelengths. In Cabeço da Ladeira, the furrows are mostly linear and
can be traced for long distances, which is why we only attempt to
compare those trails to Undichna. These traces are most common in
bed 2; in bed 3 they are cut across by a crab trackway, suggesting that
Undichna was made first. (Fig. 9G). In bed 2, two of them intersect
each other, making a meander at the point of intersection.

7. Conclusions

Trace fossils are useful to decipher paleoenvironmental conditions
and advance the knowledge about the evolutionary causes of
behavior. The upper Bajocian limestone sequence from Cabeço da
Ladeira, in the central part of Lusitanian Basin in Portugal, is
composed of a repetition of environmental conditions prone to the
development of microbial mats and oncolites in the carbonate tidal
flat, that may have expanded substantially at low tide during the
equinoctial spring tide. The result was the practically in situ killing
of echinoderm specimens and their fine preservation together with
delicate trackways and burrow details of a community dominated
by cursorial arthropods and gastropods. A moderately diverse,
shallow-tiered ichnoassemblage composed of ten ichnotaxa were
described, among them the new ichnogenera and ichnospecies
Laterigradus lusitanica and Krinodromos bentou. The first represent
different gaits attributed to sideward walking and running of a crab-
form animal. Underwater punting and aerial locomotion gaits were
described and exemplify the dawn of true crabs and the first attempts

of amphibious crabs in conquering terrestrial habitats. Together with
straight bulldozing trails attributed to the grazing behavior of
gastropods, Cabeço da Ladeira includes some of the longest
invertebrate cursorial traces in the fossil record. Krinodromos
bentou corresponds to the death march of an isocrinid crinoid in its
attempt to crawl to the shore. The elbow-crawl behavior is the first
record of stemmed crinoid locomotion from the fossil record.
