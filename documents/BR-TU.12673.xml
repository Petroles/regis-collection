Abstract

The Bois River Headwaters Suite of, Rosa Mara-Nova Iguaçu (Goiás, 
Brazil) region, are granitoids to granodioritic and tonalitic with peralumi-
nous characteristics, as distinguished granodiorite VI, granodiorite MU 
and tonalite SJ, which host gold occurrences. Under the aspect of regional 
geology, these bodies are intrusive in Santa Terezinha Sequence, and cor-
relate regionally through petrographic and geochemical similarities with 
Aurmina Suite. These rocks fall into a system collisional to post-collisional, 
possibly related to the evolution of the magmatic arc paleoproterozoic. 
Lithogeochemistry showed values in similar reasons MgO/TiO

2
, suggesting 

“trend” and evolutive aspect of lower fractionation of elements. In terms 
of tectonic setting, this suite is calc-alkaline magmatism to crustal contami-
nation or collisional granites type A2, impoverished in Rb and Y. The main 
changes observed were biotitization, hydrothermal propylitic, sericitic and 
silici?cation. Mineral chemical analyzes of biotite and muscovite con?rmed 
distinct generations of these mineral phases, resulting from hydrothermal 
alteration. The primary biotite, without rebalancing, is composed of series 
of granites calcium-orogenic alkaline, while the muscovites, more enriched 
in TiO

2
, were considered of magmatic origin.

Keywords: magmatism peraluminous, biotite-muscovite-primary, 
system collisional.

A Suíte Cabeceira do Rio dos Bois, região de Mara Rosa-Nova Iguaçu 
(GO), constitui granitoides de composição granodiorítica e tonalítica, 
com caracteristicas peraluminosas, distinguidos como granodiorito VI, 
granodiorito MU e tonalito SJ, os quais alojam ocorrências auríferas. Sob 
o aspecto da geologia regional, esses corpos são intrusivos na Sequência 
de Santa Terezinha e correlacionam-se regionalmente, por meio de seme-
lhanças petrográ?cas e geoquímicas com a Suite Aurmina. Essas rochas 
enquadram-se em um sistema colisional a pós-colisional, possivelmente

1. INTRODUCTION

The area selected for this study, called the Bois River 
Headwaters, located in the northwestern portion of the 
State of Goiás (Brazil), makes up part of the Campinorte 
Project, between latitudes S 14º03’ and 14º15’ and longi-
tude W 49º12’ and 49º16’ (Figure 1) and represents around 
75 km2. The access is facilitated by federal highway BR-153 
(Belém-Brasília), for approximately 300 km2, or the highway 
Brasilia-Barro Alto-Uruaçu, both paved. The main towns in 
the area of research are Mara Rosa and Campinorte.

This work was part of the dissertation conducted at the 
University of Brasilia and proposes a revision in geological 

data, lithogeochemical and mineral chemistry. The following 
objectives guided the study: de?nition of the main granitic 
facies in the area, its spatial distribution and petrographic char-
acterization and lithogeochemistry the granite host rocks of 
gold mineralization; study phyllosilicates major phases (biotite 
and muscovite) granite-related paragenesis. In this study, lab-
oratory techniques were used such as petrographic analysis of 
transmitted and re?ected light, which served for the selection 
of preferred ?elds to study mineral chemistry of phyllosilicates. 
This research was conducted at Microscopy Laboratory of the 
Institute of Geosciences (University of Brasilia).

2. GEOTECTONIC CONTEXT

Within a focus of geotectonic search, the region is 
located in the central portion of the Tocantins Structural 
Province, whose tectonic partitioning for the eastern segment 
comprises: Cratonic cover, Brasília Belt, Goiás Massif and 
West Magmatic Arc of Goiás, as Figure 2.

The Brasília Belt occurs on the west border of the São 
Francisco Craton, and this tectonic entity is a member of 
the Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic system formed during 
the Neoproterozoic and comprising external and internal 
areas. The outer zone is composed of metasedimentary 
units that basically groups Paranoá, Canasta and forma-
tions Ibiá and Vazante, associations volcano-sedimentary, 
Ticunzal formation, Arai group, Serra da Mesa and tinny 
granites. These rocks overlap by reverse faults the group 
Bambui deposited east.

The inner zone consists of basement areas and the 
Group Araxá associated with allochthonous units, and 

its southern portion has a structure made by overlapping 
tectonic nappes with system Araxá-Canasta. Internally to 
Neoproterozoic mobile belt basement blocks occur mainly 
Archean, represented by Median Massif of Goiás, and the 
search area is located north of Hidrolina Block, possibly in 
the areas of contact between the median Massif of Goiás 
and the Arc Mara Rosa Magmatic.

The Median Goiás Massif is a complex association 
of rocks of various types, being interpreted as a high sialic 
basement in contact with mobile belt proterozoic (Marini 
et al. 1984), or as a complex collage of crustal fragments, 
including land pre- and Neoproterozoic Brasiliano areas 
(Fuck 1994). Comprises Archean greenstone-granite terrain, 
and volcano-sedimentary sequences. 

The Goiás Magmatic Arc, exposed and de?ned in 
western Goiás, according to Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck (1992), 
covers ortognaissics paleoproterozoic terranes and volca-

no-sedimentary sequences Neoproterozoic, deformed and 
metamorphosed in the amphibolite to greenschist facies. 
In regions Arenópolis, Israelândia and Sanclerlândia the 
magmatic arc is characterized by exposures of gneiss 
terrains orthoderivated with composition ranging from 
gabbro-dioritic to granodioritic. The volcano-sedimen-
tary associations are represented by metavolcanic rocks 
ranging in composition from tholeiitic basalts to rhyolites. 

These units are intruded by granitoid metamorphic late 
to post-orogenics.

The continuity of the magmatic arc of western Goiás 
northward is con?rmed by the existence of metavolcanic 
rocks and Neoproterozoic metaplutonic old Rose in Mara 
region (Mara Rosa Magmatic Arc) with geochemical and 
isotopic signature similar to the west, suggesting the northern 
extension magmatic arc (Viana 1995).

3. REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY

A summary of the regional geology was proposed by 
Abdallah (2001) and Abdallah and Botelho (2002), which 
was developed to integrate geological data (Figure  3) 

based on ?eld work by enforcement of regional geolog-
ical pro?les. Among the works that served as reference 
in this integration are mentioned: Kuyumjian (1994),

Arantes  et  al. (1991), Silva &amp;amp; Sá (1988), Ribeiro Filho 
(1981) and Lacerda (1986).

The main lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic 
units occurring within the Campinorte Project are: gran-
ite-greenstone terrain, psamo-pelitic (Santa Terezinha 
Sequence), Serra da Mesa Group, Mara Rosa Sequence 
and intrusive granites of the Rio dos Bois Suite, this last 
the object of this research.

Lithological associations with typical granite-green-
stone terrains occupy a vast area of the southern portion 
of the Campinorte Project represented by Hidrolina 
Dome, which, according to the definition of Danni and 
Ribeiro (1978), constitutes portions of granitic basement 
of the Median Massif of Goiás. This set features regional 
distribution and lithologic homogeneity, becoming the 
leucocratic gneisses of granodioritic to tonalitic whose 
gneissic banding is defined by alternating levels of 
quartz-feldspathic and micaceous amphibolitic narrow 
bands, usually observed migmatitic features. In general, 
the metamorphism is amphibolite facies, although min-
eral parageneses indicative of granulite facies can be 
verified. In general the region Hidrolina is compartmen-
talized into three major structural domains: shear zone, 
granitic Hidrolina Dome and allochthonous fragments 
of Araxá Group, according to Kuyumjian et al. (2004).

The Santa Terezinha Sequence is a restricted portion 
midwest, especially among Campinorte and Nova Iguaçu 
city. In this region, the sequence consists of a set of su-
pracrustal metasedimentary sequence, making tectonic 
contacts with rocks Hidrolina Dome and drive west of 
Mara Rosa Sequence. The main rocks of this sequence in 
the region are garnet-chlorite-muscovite schists, quartz 
muscovite schist, biotite schist and chlorite schist.

The Santa Terezinha Sequence represents the whole 
volcano-sedimentary low-grade metamorphic, located 
north of the city with the same name and located in the 
central portion of the Massif of Goiás This sequence has 
been correlated to the Mara Rosa Sequence, the Group 
Araxá and also as an integral part of the upper unit 
of land greenstone belts. Recently, this sequence was 
individualized as the unit being assigned to your Paleo-
proterozoic metamorphic set of low-grade metamorphic, 
predominantly psammitic and pelitic metasedimentary 
rocks. Subordinate, this sequence also contains felsic 
metavolcanic rocks and metaultramafic (Kuyumjian 
et al. 2004).

In the Serra da Mesa and Serra Dourada, north of 
Goiás, based on stratigraphic evidence, lithological and 
tectonic, Marini et  al. (1977) proposed the name of 
Serra da Mesa Group to package metamorphic granitic 
massifs bordering the homonyms and mapped previously 
as Group Araxá. In the eastern area of work there is a 
set of predominantly metapsamitic rocks, metamorphic 
mapped initially as Group Araxá and later redefined as 
Serra da Mesa Group, probably mid-Proterozoic age. 
It is a set of quartz-mica schist, quartzite micaceous 
with abundant quartz veins, in the case of a metased-

imentary sequence with subordinate carbonate contri-
bution, as seen through the lenses of marble near the 
city of Campinorte. The contact with mylonitic granite 
is defined by extensive shear zones associated with 
thrust faults.

Specifically in the region of Mara Rosa, supracrustal 
units that constitute the volcano-sedimentary sequence 
are arranged in three main areas, structural directioned 
northeast and dips northwest, called band East, Central 
and West, according to Arantes et al. (1991). The eastern 
range was divided into four major stratigraphic units, 
from bottom to top: Amaro Leite Unit, comprised me-
tagraywackes interlayered with mafic metatuffs; Araras 
Unit, metatuffs mafic to intermediate with interbedded 
metagraywackes, and felsic metavolcanic metacherts; 
Posse Unit, metatuffs felsic; and Carambolas Unit, 
composed of metatuffs sequence of mafic to felsic 
metavolcanic intercalations. All these rock types have 
undergone metamorphism that reached the amphibolite 
facies, which is the host of gold mineralization in the 
deposit Posse, the Posse felsic unit.

Small granitic intrusions, of approximately 2-3 km 
from the major axis, occur in the Bois River Headwaters, 
also intrusive in the volcano-sedimentary sequence of 
Mara Rosa and designated here Mundinho granite, Vi-
uva granite and St. George granite, characterized as Bois 
River Suite, which are the subject of detailing. The local 
geology is represented in Figure 4, in which the main 
contacts, geological and structural features are presented. 
Three main lithologic assemblages distributed along the 
headboard of the Bois River designated metasedimentary 
sequence, volcanic-sedimentary sequence Mara Rosa and 
deformed granites were defined. Granite Viúva (type 
VI) is represented by a granite body of approximately 3 
km2, quite hydrothermally altered and development of 
penetrative foliation marked by non-micaceous minerals. 
The Mundinho granite (type MU) constitutes a body of 
granite tectonite, an ellipsoid, flattened intrusive in a 
volcano-sedimentary sequence and variations in tecton-
ic contact with quartzite and quartz muscovite schist. 
The features of mylonitization are quite pronounced in 
these granitoids, as feldspar porphyroblasts stretch and 
quartz, related to shear zone with north-south directions 
and development of foliation associated with sulphide 
and auriferous veins.

The granitic rocks of Bois River present U-Pb ages 
ranging from 2179 to 2158 Ma, and there is no Archean 
contribution according Giustina (2007). The TDM Sm-
Nd model ages from supracrustal Campinorte Sequence 
and intrusive lithotypes of Bois River vary from 2682 
to 2216  Ma, with mostly positive ?Nd values, which 
disclose the juvenile character of these rocks, in other 
words, the juvenile character with short crustal resi-
dence. The granodiorite yielded from zircon fractions 
revealed variably discordant compositions indicating 
an upper intercept age of 2173±10 Ma (MSWD=0.54), 
interpreted as being representative of the igneous crys-

tallization age. Zircon grains from metatonalite with 
five concordant zircon grains resulted in an upper 
intercept age of 2163±1 Ma (MSWD=0.76) which is 
also interpreted as the age of igneous crystallization. 
The  mylonitic tonalite five spot analyses yielded a 
concordia age of 2158±8  Ma (MSWD=0.5), which is 
taken as the best estimate for the crystallization age of 
the igneous protolith.

Geocronologic regional works dating U-Pb in zircon 
of metagranite associated with supracrustals provides a 
value of 2175±12 Ma for igneous crystallization (Pimentel 
et al. 1997). Isotopic analyzes result in Sm-Nd model ages 

(TDM) into metagranitics rocks between 2.52 and 2.3 Ga 
and positive ?Nd (Kuyumjian et  al. 2004), which thus 
indicates the juvenile character of short crustal residence 
for sequence Campinorte and associated metagranitics. 
The data presented by Giustina (2007) is similar to other 
Paleoproterozoic Provinces described in the Brasília Belt, 
but it contrasts with negative ?

 values in granitoids of 

west border and Serrinha Blocks of San Francisco Craton, 
in the same age, which have features of material with 
long residency and crustal contamination; hence, this 
study  contributes to the reconstruction of the Columbia 
supercontinent (Abdallah 2011).

4. PETROGRAPHIC FEATURE OF SUITE OF BOIS RIVER

In this section we present the main petrographic types, 
the most representative of the studied granites, and textural 
and mineralogical aspects of the rocks, which were summa-
rized in the facies of hydrothermal processes preserved, and 
which has in biotite and muscovite granite paragenesis. Thus, 
it comes down to biotite muscovite peraluminous tonalite 
SJ, albitizated tonalite SJ, biotite muscovite granodiorite VI 
(biotite rebalanced), and muscovite biotite granodiorite MU 
(magmatic muscovite and biotite).

The tonalite SJ predominates muscovite and biotite 
which was possible to characterize three types petrographic 
whose primary composition varies in function of intensity 
of hydrothermal alteration, as albitization, sericitization 
(potassic alteration), biotitization and propylitic (propylitic 
alteration), designated informally as Gc, Gb and Ga, with 
variations in mineralogical composition in function the 
stage of the hydrothermal alteration and the amount of 
secondary minerals.

The ?rst type, Gc, is a metatonalite (samples 111C and 
111C1), comprises macroscopically a rock with granolepi-
doblastic texture, coarse grained and foliation marked by 
biotite lamellae orientation. Feldspars exhibit tabular habit 
and oval form and reach up to 1.5 cm in diameter and is 
surrounded by biotite. Microscopically, it is composed of the 
following mineral phases, quartz, albite, biotite, and zoizite, 
titanite, chlorite, tourmaline and opaque include between 
magnetite and pyrite (Figures 5A and 5B). The predominant 
feldspar is albite (Ab 100%) and generally presents with an-
hedric forms, with frequent mantle around the recrystallized 
quartz mineral and rarely presenting twinning according 
to the albite law preserved. As the main product change, 
occurs the formation of white mica and epidote. The masses 
of quartz is anhedral crystals with ondulation extinction 
and polygons contacts, biotite form plates throughout with 
brown coloration (Figure 5B), which may be completely 
chlorized. In small amounts, it is observed pyrite usually 
with a halo of alteration to limonite, and traces of magnetite, 
as products of hydrothermal alteration. The titanite may 
have navicular habit, but in general it is anhedric shaped, 
brownish color and frequently associated with aggregates 
of biotite and epidote.

Another type petrographic, Gb (samples 111B and 
111B1), it is metatonalite, probably a more altered facies 
observed in this area. It corresponds to a rock of light 
gray, medium grained presenting an incipient banding. The 
mineralogy is mainly represented by more altered feldspar, 
mainly albite, and quartz and actinolite. This rock has 
disseminations of sulphides as pyrite and chalcopyrite, and 
pyrite displays euhedric shapes and coloformic.

The sample Ga is biotite muscovite metatonalite (samples 
111A2 and A3) that have under microscopy presents inequi-
granular texture, medium to coarse grained and grayish white. 
It develops discrete foliation marked by micaceous minerals, 
mainly biotite. Sample is less deformed among the other 
rock types granite. The mineralogy consists of plagioclase 
(albite), K-feldspar, biotite, white mica, epidote, quartz and 
magnetite (dashes). Petrographically characterized by higher 
amounts of white mica, generated by intense sericitization 
which was submitted and the modal proportion of biotite 
subordinate. The latter are presented as isolated plates with 
pleochroism brown tint and represent remains of magmatic 
biotite. The feldspars have become quite sericitized.

In the body biotite muscovite granodiorite VI were char-
acterized petrographic types that host gold mineralization 
and variations are hydrothermally-altered granodiorite, with 
deformation features developed, as can be seen in Figures 6A 
to 6D. Basically, this body hydrothermally granodiorite VI 
hosts auriferous veins showing variations in the relative 
intensity of hydrothermal alteration.

The sample VIA, muscovite biotite granodiorite cat-
aclastic, corresponds to grayish rock, coarse to medium 
grained texture and granolepdoblastic foliation marked by 
the preferred orientation of micaceous minerals. The miner-
alogy essentially comprises albite, K feldspar, biotite, white 
mica, epidote, and in proportions subordinated, there is 
ilmenite and pyrite, and tourmaline, zircon and titanite as 
accessories. The plagioclase is mainly albite (Ab 100%), 
showing xenomor?c habit with oval form, often showing 
albite twinning law. The fenoclasts feature heavily stretched 
and rotated (Figure 6D) usually surrounded by a mantle of 
change consists of white mica, quartz and epidote or only 
with halo of recrystallized quartz. The quartz grains present

in this lithotype are xenomor?cs habit, heterogeneity in size 
and exhibit wavy extinction, with contacts polygon. The bi-
otite shows up as plates or lamellae well developed, primary 
type rebalanced (Figure 6B), with brown pleochroism, and 
occurs associated with hydrothermal white mica and epidote 
aggregates; often these minerals form shear bands marked 
by irregular and narrow bands, where they alternate with 
bands mainly composed of recrystallized quartz.

In type VI4A1 it constitutes variation from the previous 
sample, and also checked deformation and hydrotermal ef-
fects, with higher modal proportion of biotite and titanite. 
Aplitic dikes are observed in sectioning this lithofacies 
where lodges by gold-bearing quartz vein, always with 
substantial amount of chlorite. The sample VIVI represents 

a coarse-grained to pegmatoid biotite granodiorite texture 
inequigranular with reddish due to weathering, and pres-
ents features of cataclasis as fractured feldspars and drawn 
according to a foliation of biotite primary rebalanced 
(Figure 6C), and twinned twinning twisted. This sample is 
granitic texture with better preserved.

The lithofacies granodiorite are represented by sample 
53C, designated biotite muscovite granodiorite MU, the more 
preserved lithofacies, with both primary and magmatic biotite. 
This is characterized by strongly stretched porphyroclasts 
of feldspar and quartz surrounded  by alteration mantle of 
quartz (?ne aggregates), epidotes and white mica. The essential 
mineralogy comprises phenocrysts of feldspar (microcline) 
and plagioclase (albite), the latter in greater quantity, and

white mica, biotite and epidote. Magnetite and pyrite occurs 
in trace amounts. Micas occur as isolated lamellae (biotite) or 
as oriented aggregates of white mica (muscovite). Furthermore  
occurs subordinate amounts of carbonate (greater than 90% 
percent weight by calcite) (Figure 7B).

In the facies biotite granodiorite mylonitic MU, sample 
SA5A, rock is light gray, very altered/hydrotermal effects, with 
millimeter strips of dark gray coloration consisting primarily of 

biotite and muscovite (biotite foliated), featuring a prominent 
foliation. We highlight some aspects mineralogical as chloriti-
zation of biotite and quite common the presence of alteration 
minerals such as calcite carbonate. The chlorite shows lamellar 
habit or form aggregates of thin lamellae with pleochroism 
ranging from light green to colorless and presenting anomalous 
interference color. It is observed in this rock the presence of 
relict material mylonitic granite (Figure 7).

5. MINERAL CHEMISTRY

This topic studies, through mineral chemistry, the 
major phases of phyllosilicates observed in granitic rocks, 
mainly biotite and muscovite. The chemical analyzes 
were made using electronic microprobe, Cameca SX-
50® model, in the Laboratory of Electron microprobe of 
the University of Brasília. Preliminarily, we performed 
a study and a petrographic analysis of the optical prop-

erties of minerals and separation fields preferred for 
chemical analysis.

Most of these minerals have signi?cant compositional vari-
ations, i.e. rebalancing physicochemical related to hydrothermal 
processes that have acted on the granitic rocks. Especially phases 
micaceous white mica and biotite, as well as albite and chlorite, which 
are relatively abundant in hydrothermal granites VI MU and SJ types.

5.1. Biotite

The study of the chemical composition of biotite formed 
auxiliary tool in the de?nition and characterization of the 
granitic rocks in the region of research. The ferromagnesian 
mineral primary, often in the composition of granitic rocks, 
so with distinction, re?ects the nature and physicochemical 
conditions of this magma. Metasomatic-hydrothermal con-
ditions in the presence of biotite can be characterized a zone 
of enrichment potassium granite or potassium alteration.

The micaceous mineral is biotite with trioctahedral 
structure, with the general formula X

Basically we analyzed the major elements in the form of 
oxides. How stands the chemical composition of magmatic 
biotite are diagnostic of the types of magmas generated 
from different sources and different petrogenetic histories, 
according to Nachit (1986) and Abdel-Rahman (1994).

The biotite from two mica granites studied usually oc-
curs in the form of lamellae and has preserved when brown 
coloration brownish, and are common in transformation 
to chlorite (chloritic). In the diagram proposed by Nachit 
(1986) for different types of biotite granitic rocks (Figure 8), 
where the vertices are 10TiO

2
, FeO+MnO and MgO, we 

de?ne the primary ?elds of brown biotite, biotite domain 

of primary rebalanced green-brown and ?nally the ?eld of 
secondary biotite of green.

The three types of biotite granites can be identi?ed 
in the study: biotite I, primary found in biotite muscovite 
metagranodiorite MU, variety richer in TiO

2
; biotite type II 

primary rebalanced in an intermediate position, identi?ed in 
SJ metatonalite biotite muscovite, biotite muscovite granodi-
orite VI and biotite granodiorite VI. Biotite is nearer to the 
secondary type III, in a more advanced stage of hydrothermal 
transformation identi?ed in biotite muscovite SJ and biotite 
muscovite MU hydrothermalized, and only the primary bi-
otite can be used for the granites tipology. The recognition 
of these different biotite phases constitutes essential point 
in the development of this study.

The replacement of Ti in octahedral sites has been stud-
ied in biotite metamorphic having consensus in the literature 
that the content of Ti in biotite increases with metamorphic 
grade, i.e. with increasing of temperature. The decrease in Ti 
studied biotite is related to hydrothermal processes that acted 
on granitic rocks area, so that titanium was extracted from 
the structure of biotite rich in titanium by these hydrothermal 
solutions and crystallization as a new mineral phase rich in 
titanium as titanite and/or rutile and/or ilmenite.

Geology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic

Geochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014

In the diagram of classi?cation of biotite from Deer 
et  al. (1992 – Figure 9), where the poles are positioned 
trioctaedrics non-litiniferas micas, it can be distinguished 
?elds of biotites and phlogopites, and the iron rich series an-
nite-siderophyllite and magnesian series phlogopite-estonite. 

From the Figure 9 it is characterized that three types of 
biotite was designated types I, II, III, related to the phases 
of development of this granitic magmatism. The biotite 
type I observed in samples 53C and 111A2 represents the 
primary biotite in granodiorite MU and tonalite SJ, whose 
analyzes are concentrated in the ?eld iron richest biotite 
of annite-siderophyllite series. The biotite type II, primary 
rebalanced, observed in muscovite biotite granodiorite VI, is 
located in the ?eld of biotite Fe richer, but concentrated on 
the intermediate portions between annite and phlogopite, 
and have brown coloring and lamellar habit.

The biotite type III, near to the secondary field, 
belongs to the phlogopite-estonite series forming trioc-
taedrics micas more enriched in MgO. It is often asso-
ciated with ?lms biotites foliated (granodiorite MU) or 
as disseminated plates in metatonalite SJ, samples 111C. 
It presents brownish coloring tending to greenish to color-
less pleochroism and found often chlorited associated with 
sul?des mainly pyrite and chalcopyrite. These variations in 
the composition of biotite can be seen in the graph TiO

2
 x 

MgO (Figure 10), in which the type III biotite is typically 
depleted in TiO

2
 and typically more magnesian biotite in 

relation to types I and II.

The study of the chemistry of primary biotite granitic 
rocks have been used for classi?cation into different types of 
associations or magma magmatic series according to Nachit 
(1986). The positioning of the biotite in diagram Mg vs. Al 
(afu is atom per formula unit) proposed (Figure 11), in which 
can be distinguished different groups of magmatic biotite, 
based on the relationship between cationic Mg and Al, is 
both in the ?eld of alumino-potassic high MgO granitic series 
(biotite II, primary rebalanced), as the ?eld of calc-alkaline 
series (biotite I, primary). Note that the biotite rebalanced 
should be interpreted with caution in this diagram, consider-
ing that the biotite II clearly had an enrichment of aluminum, 
moving into the alumino-potassic domain.

Abdel-Rahman (1994), using a database containing 
325 analyzes biotite granite of the various locations, showed 
that the composition of biotite depends on the nature of the 
magma from which crystallized, and on the types of granitic 
suites including alkaline anarogenic suite type A, calcium 
alkaline orogenic suite type C and peraluminous suite type P. 

In the ternary diagram MgO x FeO x Al
2
O

3
 (Figure 12), 

it appears that the investigated biotite granites ?eld con-
centrates on the calcium alkaline series (type C), in the case 
of primary biotite I of granodiorite MU and granodiorite 
VI, it was also con?rmed in the diagram of Nachit (1986) 
the calcium alkaline character. Others biotite tend to ?eld 
peraluminous series as samples of tonalite SJ, showing that 
there was a rebalancing effectively with enrichment in alu-
minum, positioning them in the ?eld peraluminous domain.

5.2. Muscovite 

The muscovite mica represents important mineral phase 
in the paragenesis of granitic rocks and also geological sig-
ni?cance in the context of the mineralized areas, designated 
generally as white mica. The investigations led to distin-
guishing different types of white mica, textural differences 
being observed as well-developed lamellae or also in the 
form of aggregates of ?ne lamellae. Regardless of habit, the 
pleochroism can vary from colorless to slightly pale. 

Based on the ternary diagram represented by poles, 
Al, M+2 (Fe+Mn+Mg) and Si (Figure 13), which de?nes the 
extremes of mica white as a solid solution consisting by 
muscovite and celadonite according to the classi?cation of 
Rieder et  al. (1998). Micas analyzed are located near the 
pole of phengite and can be classi?ed as muscovite-phengite, 
both the primary and the secondary.

The incorporation of Ti in the structure of dioctaed-
rics micas has been widely used to study the evolution of 
granites. An important conclusion from this study refers to 
increasing the titanium solubility with increasing of the grade 
metamorphic, i.e. of the temperature (Monier and Robert 
1986). Muscovites in the two-mica granites, Ti has been 
used to distinguish magmatic muscovites of the muscovites 
post-magmatic or late, the ?rst typically more enriched in 
titanium, due to the greater availability of Ti in the early stag-

es of crystallization. Such that the more enriched micas may 
occur either in metamorphic rocks such as in granitic rocks.

Based on Figure 14 Al

 boundary between 

primary and secondary muscovite corresponds to around 
of 0.6% TiO

2
, from which we can characterize three types 

of muscovites designated I, II and III, type II intermediate 
between I and III.

The muscovite type I corresponds to the typical pri-
mary magmatic phase, occurring mainly granodiorite MU, 
appearing as aggregates of plates in paragenesis with mag-
matic biotite. The muscovite type II, intermediate between 
the two types of TiO

2
, has values between 0.4 and 0.6%, 

occurs predominantly granodiorite VI in the form of lamellar, 
aggregates oriented phengite and represents an intermediate 
stage in the evolution of hydrothermal sometimes in para-
genesis primary biotite rebalanced.

The type III represents fengites aluminous compared 
to other, occurs in the form of thin lamellar masses and 
characterized by lower values of TiO2, forming white mica 
hydrothermal example, both the tonalite SJ (in paragenesis 
with magnesian biotite), as well as granodiorite VI. Indis-
tinctly, muscovite varieties have signi?cant values between 
0.3 and 0.6% BaO, not ?nding correspondence with other 
types of muscovite in the literature.

6. LITHOGEOCHEMISTRY

The lithogeochemistry study aimed to characterize 
the chemistry of the granitic Bois River Suite, host of gold 
mineralization, through the analysis of major elements, trace 
elements and rare earth elements. Note that the selection 
of granite types for analysis was to test the petrography, 
which were less altered and hydrothermalized. The chemical 
analyzes were performed at the Laboratory Bondar-Clegg, 
Canada, the major elements by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) 
and trace elements analyzed by neutron activation (INAA).

The chemical composition of the rocks will be used in 
order to establish criteria to diagnose the type of original 
granite, since in petrography, the studied rocks were subjected 
to hydrothermal and metasomatic processes from highest to 
lowest intensity. However, the performance of metasomatic 
processes implies that the geochemical characteristics of these 
documents have changed, especially in relation to mobile 
elements. Given these observations, the geochemical compo-
sitions will be used in a qualitative manner, especially in an 
attempt to identify the composition of granites and tectonic 
environment. The samples selected for analysis in general do 
not present the effects of weathering and represent granitic 
types most characteristic of each lithofacies. The results of 
chemical analyzes performed are presented in tables, which 
we used for the preparation of diagrams petrochemicals.

The rocks studied were classi?ed using the diagram 
Debon and Lefort (1983), which uses the parameters P and 
Q (Figure 15), to indicate the tonalitic granodioritic composi-
tion. In granodiorites VI and MU predominates granodioritic 
in composition and only tonalitic in type SJ. Three samples 

were positioned outside of the petrographic ?elds, being 
those most hydrothermalized. This diagram was preferred 
naming regarding classic petrographic classi?cation due to 
mineralogical transformations suffered by these granites. 

For geochemical study of the granites were used varia-
tion diagrams of major oxides and trace elements, in order to 
describe the behavior and evolution of these granites. In the 
diagram MgO x TiO

2
 (Figure 16), there is similarity between 

the ratio MgO/TiO
2

 of the samples despite hydrothermal al-
teration developed, i.e., these elements were not signi?cantly 
modi?ed in relation to magmatic concentrations. The rocks 
analyzed show an evolution of the less evolved granitic to 
terms with little MgO and TiO

2
 in chemical composition.

In binary type Harker diagrams showing variations of 
the different oxides in relation to the silica for the granites 
of Bois River Suite, the content of SiO2 ranges from 57 to 
81%, the one of Al

6.1. Tectonic setting

Aiming to investigate the genesis of the granitic Rio dos 
Bois Suite and the environment of formation of these granitic 
rocks, drew up discriminant diagrams of lithogeochemistry. 
In  the multicationic graphical R1- R2, Bachelor Bowden 
(1985) the granodiorite VI samples show characteristics of 
peraluminous magmatism system syn-collisional to post-colli-
sional, and SJ tonalite with geochemical signature of post-col-
lisional granites (Figure 18). This interpretation agrees with 
the analysis using the graphics Pearce et al. (1984), where they 
present post to syn-collisional characteristics.

Applying content (Nb/Zr)N vs. Zr normalized to prim-
itive mantle of Sun and McDonough (1989) and according 
with Thiéblemont and Tégyey (1994), (Figure 19), the Rio 
dos Bois Suite, falls largely in the ?eld of calc-alkaline mag-
matism to crustal contamination (?eld B) or A2/colisional 

granitoid type with crustal sources, whose ratio Y/Nb is 
above 1.2. Granitic type A1 ratio Y/Nb is less than 1.2 and 
is characterized by continental intraplate environment or 
Rift (?eld C). Within a system of convergent plate margin, 
this granitogenese corresponds to the later phases of the 
Arc collisional system. Thus, some samples plots in ?eld 
on the edge of the calc-alkaline magmatism derived from 
subduction zone, considering that they evolved from the 
continental margin Arc of the primitive type of Paleop-
roterozoic age.

In Figure 20 the best preserved specimens are in the 
?eld of syn-collisional to post-collisional granitic, where it 
is emphasized that types of samples over hydrothermalized 
are in the ?eld intraplate granites due to Y enrichement in 
during the hydrothermal process.

Only in samples Gb and Gc of tonalite SJ, the composition is 
metaluminous. The difference with this character geochemi-
cal metaluminous in SJ types, since their biotite compositions 
are indicating peraluminous, should chemical changes and 
rebalancing suffered by biotite, re?ecting metasomatic-hy-
drothermal process in the rock, with enrichment of alumina 
during this process.

Papers in granites of Australia developed by Blevin and 
Chappell (1995) relate ISA values&lt;1.1 to I-type granites and 

ISA&gt;1.1 to S-type granite. The tonalitic rocks Gb and Gc 
of the SJ tonalite show ISA values&amp;lt;1, while the other rocks 
values are equal or close to 1.1. In terms of minor elements, 
granitic rocks have content BaO between 100 and 670 ppm 
with great variation to the terms more acidic. The content 
of yttrium ranges of 10 to 100 ppm, and the highest levels 
found in granodiorite intensely hydrothermalized type VI 
and MU. Zirconium ranges from 80 to 350 ppm with higher 
values associated with granodiorite VI and MU.

The total content of rare earth elements (REE) 
i n  t h e s e  g r a n i t e s  r a n g e  f r o m  m o d e r a t e  i n  g r a n -
odiorite VI  (105–206  ppm) and granodiorite MU 
(69–330 ppm) and low in the tonalitic metatonalites 
SJ  (69–124 ppm). The REE patterns of Bois River granite 
(Figures 21 A, B, C) show light rare earth ratios for heavy 
light rare earth element (LREE)/heavy rare earth element 
(HREE) values through the ratio La/Lu. In granodiorite 
VI (Figure 21B), values are presented from 8 to 10,6 
showing small fractionation, and the sample VIA has 
negative Eu anomally, as observed qualitatively.

The granodiorite MU (Figure 21C) has values from 
1.8 to 5.6 featuring small fractionation between light and 
heavy, while the sample 109 shows larger to moderate 
fractionation. In tonalite SJ REE values show up moderate 
to weak fractionation, ranging from 41 to 257, with posi-
tive Europeum (Eu) anomalies due to analytical problems. 

In the most altered granitic rocks it can be observed lower 
fractionation between LREE and HREE, probably indicating 
that the process of hydrothermal alteration decreased the 
relative concentrations of REEs due to the homogenization 
that occurred between the elements.

In multilementar diagrams samples were from a plot-
ted area of Bois River which are characterized generally by 
negative anomalies of Nb, K, P and Ti, observing a slight to 
moderate standard large-ion litophile (LIL) fractionation 
relative to Y and REE. Rb concentrations are low in these

calc-alkaline and peraluminous granites.

Geology and geochemistry of Bois River Suite, Mara Rosa (GO): evidence of magmatic arc paleoproterozoic

Geochimica Brasiliensis 28(1): 43-64, 2014

7. CONCLUSIONS

8. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In the area Bois River were characterized granitic bod-
ies, mainly granodiorite VI, MU and tonalite SJ; intrusions 
are small- to medium-sized, well-deformed and intrusive in 
sequence Campinorte, and occur as NNE-trending elongate 
plutons showing varied degrees of deformation. The main 
granite bodies are represented by Mundinho and Viúva 
intrusions, which host gold deposits related to Au Porphiry 
in paleoproterozoic transcorrent shear zone. 

The classi?cation of these rocks indicates granodioritic to 
tonalitic composition. The Bois River Suite exhibit character-
istics of magmatism, predominantly peraluminous, that are in 
the ?eld syn-collisional to post-collisional granitic. The sam-
ples of more hydrothermalized type are located in the ?eld of 
granite intraplaque due to enriched in Y, Yb and Ta. The MgO/
TiO

2
 ratios in granites are similar, despite the hydrothermal 

alteration developed, i.e., these elements have not been signi?-
cantly modi?ed from the magmatic concentrations. The rocks 
analyzed show an evolution from the less evolved granites 
to terms with little MgO and TiO

2
 in chemical composition.

Studies of mineral chemistry in biotite and muscovite 
showed that these minerals have signi?cant compositional 
variations, i.e., rebalancing physic-chemical related to hy-
drothermal processes that have acted on the granitic rocks. 
Three types of biotite designated type I, II, III has been 
characterized, related to different phases of development of 
these granites: biotite I, primary, is richer in variety TiO

2
, 

biotite type II is primary biotite rebalanced, and type III 
(magnesian), secondary impoverished in TiO

2
.

 x FeO the biotite 

of this Suite focuses both on the ?eld of calc-alkaline series, 
type C (biotite granodiorite MU), as the peraluminous series 
in tonalite SJ. The white micas analyzed are located near the 
pole muscovite fhengite, and may qualify them as phengite, 
both the primary and the secondary. It has been possible to 
characterize three types of white mica, muscovite I, II and III. 
The muscovite I is primary magmatic muscovite and II, III 
type are secondary and intermediate a more aluminous and 
characterized by lower values of TiO
