RESUMO 

Recentemente, a comunidade científica especializada vem concentrando seus esforços na 

identificação, caracterização e quantificação dos microplásticos, definidos pela literatura como 

partículas plásticas menores que 5 milímetros. Microplásticos então presentes na superfície dos 

oceanos, em praias arenosas e ambientes lamosos, desde o Equador até os Pólos, em praias urbanas 

e regiões remotas do globo, e ainda depositados em sedimentos profundos (&gt;2.000m). 

Experimentos de laboratório indicam que estas partículas plásticas podem ser ingeridas por 

organismos de todos os níveis da teia trófica marinha. Poluentes orgânicos, como DDTs e PCBs, e 

inorgânicos presentes na água do mar podem estar adsorvidos a estes plásticos, transportando 

contaminantes químicos para diversas regiões do globo, ou sendo liberados quando no trato 

gastrointestinal de vertebrados e invertebrados se ingeridos, podendo ainda ser transportados ao 

longo da teia trófica marinha. Há mais de 10 anos relata-se que no Oceano Pacífico Norte 

microplásticos estão presentes principalmente no centro do giro subtropical, aparentemente 

influenciados por variáveis oceanográficas. Para o Oceano Atlântico tropical, evidências sobre a 

presença de microplásticos existiam apenas para as praias arenosas do Arquipélago de Fernando de 

Noronha (3°S, 32°W), e para as águas adjacentes ao Arquipélago de São Pedro e São Paulo. Para 

preencher esta lacuna, microplásticos foram o foco da amostragem em três importantes ambientes 

insulares no oeste do Oceano Atlântico tropical: Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha, 

Arquipélago de Abrolhos (17°S, 38°W) e a Ilha da Trindade (20°S, 29°W) em 4 expedições 

científicas realizadas entre dezembro de 2011 e março de 2013. Plásticos flutuantes foram 

amostrados através de arrastos planctônicos (neuston) nas áreas marinhas adjacentes a estes 

ambientes. Um total de 160 arrastos foi realizado. Em Trindade, mais de 90% dos arrastos estavam 

contaminados por microplásticos, identificados como fragmentos duros, fragmentos moles, paint 

chips, linhas e fibras. Em Noronha e Abrolhos aproximadamente metade dos arrastos estava 

contaminada. Fragmentos plásticos duros foram os tipos de itens mais amostrados assim como em 

outros estudos de microplásticos em amostras de plâncton. Entre os fragmentos, &gt;75% tinham 5mm 

ou menos. A contaminação média foi de 0,03 partículas por m³, inferior às quantidades previamente 

conhecidas no Oceano Pacífico. As amostras de microplásticos depositados na superfície do 

sedimento foram coletadas nas praias arenosas em cada uma das ilhas através de quadrantes. As 

amostras coletadas também foram analisadas quanto a granulometria predominante, já que estas 

informações ainda eram inexistentes para as ilhas estudadas. Em Abrolhos nenhuma partícula 

plástica foi amostrada. Fragmentos plásticos duros e esférulas plásticas foram identificados somente 

em Fernando de Noronha e Trindade, sendo que o lado mais exposto à ação de ventos e corrente 

superficias predominantes estava mais contaminado, quando comparado ao lado relativamente mais 

protegido nas ilhas estudadas. Estes resultados são os primeiros indícios da contaminação do oeste 

do Oceano Atlântico tropical em relação à contaminação por microplásticos. A presença destes 

microplásticos alerta para a vulnerabilidade destas ilhas e sua biota em relação á contaminação por 

plásticos.

ABSTRACT 

Recently, the scientific community is focussed on the identification, characterization e 

quantification of microplastics, defined in the literature as those plastic particles with less than 5 

millimetres. Microplastics are widespread on the ocean’s surface, on sand beaches and mud 

sediments, from the equator to the poles, on urban beaches and remote regions in the globe, and 

even deposited on deep sediments (&gt;2,000m). Laboratory experiments indicate that organisms from 

every level of the marine food web potentially ingest microplastic particles. Organic, such as DDTs 

and PCBs, and inorganic pollutants available in seawater may adsorbed onto microplastics, 

transporting chemical contaminants to diverse regions in the globe, or being released in the 

gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates and invertebrates if ingested, when they are even transported 

along the marine food web. For more than 10 years, there were reports on the occurrence of 

microplastics in the North Pacific Ocean, mainly in the centre of the subtropical gyre, probably 

influenced by oceanographic variables. To the tropical Atlantic Ocean, however, evidences on the 

presence of microplastics were available only to sandy beaches in the Fernando de Noronha 

Archipelago (3°S, 32°W), and to waters around the São Pedro e São Paulo Archipelago. To fulfil 

this gap, microplastics were studied in three important insular environments in the western Atlantic 

Ocean: the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, the Abrolhos Archipelago (17°S, 38°W) and the 

Trindade island (20°S, 29°W), during four scientific expeditions between December 2011 and 

March 2103. Floating plastics were collected by plankton tows (neuston) on the sea surface in the 

adjacent region to these environments. A total of 160 tows were conducted. In Trindade Island, 

more than 90% of the tows were contaminated with microplastics, identified as hard plastic 

fragments, soft fragments, paint chips, lines and fibres. In Fernando de Noronha and Abrolhos, 

approximately half of the tows were contaminated. Hard plastic fragments were the majority of the 

sampled items, as well as reported in other studies with plankton samples. Among plastic 

fragments, &gt;75% had 5mm or less. The mean contamination pattern was 0.03 particles/m³, less than 

previously reported on the Pacific Ocean. Microplastics sampled on sediments were collected on 

sandy beaches in each island by quadrants dispoded in the strandline. Samples were also analysed 

in the relation to the main grain size of sediments because these information was still non-existent 

to the studied islands. In Abrolhos, no plastic particle was sampled. Hard plastic fragments and 

plastic pellets were identified in Fernando de Noronha and Trindade, where the windward side of 

the islans were significantly more contaminated when compared to the leeward side. These results 

are the first results indicating the occurrence of microplastic debris particles in the Western tropical 

Atlantic Ocean. The occurrence of microplastics highlights the vulnerability of these islands and 

their biota in relation to microplastic pollution.

INTRODUÇÃO 

O termo plástico significa “maleável” ou “flexível”. As primeiras pesquisas que deram origem 

à descoberta dos plásticos que conhecemos atualmente datam de meados do Século XIX (Moore e 

Phillips 2010). Cem anos depois, impulsionada pelas crescentes necessidades de uma sociedade de 

consumo e pelos advindos da II Guerra Mundial, a já bem estabelecida indústria dos plásticos 

começa então a produzi-los em grandes quantidades. Até hoje novos materiais (polímeros) - que 

como os primeiros plásticos são obtidos do petróleo, gás natural e carvão - são descobertos e 

comercializados, alimentando uma indústria que produz mais de duzentas milhões de toneladas por 

ano. Entre os plásticos ou polímeros mais utilizados, e consequentemente, mais descartados pela 

sociedade moderna, estão o polietileno (PE) de alta e baixa densidades, polipropileno (PP), cloreto 

de polivinila (PVC), poliestireno (PS) e tereftalato de polietileno (PET) (Thompson et al. 2009). 

Juntos, eles representam cerca de 90% da produção global de plásticos (Andrady 2011). As 

possibilidades tecnológicas oferecidas pelos polímeros nunca foram tão grandes; nenhum material 

utilizado pela sociedade jamais foi tão flexível e moldável às nossas necessidades. 

Duas das características que fazem do plástico um material tão útil à sociedade – seu baixo 

peso e durabilidade – também fazem com que os plásticos descartados de forma inapropriada causem 

danos significativos ao meio ambiente (Ryan et al. 2009). A presença de resíduos plásticos &gt;5 mm, 

denominados macroplásticos, em ambientes marinhos e costeiros foi extensivamente documentada 

pela literatura científica especializada nos últimos 40 anos (Moore 2008), inclusive no litoral do 

Brasil (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2007, Santos et al. 2009, Ivar do Sul et al. 2011). Entre os danos mais 

visíveis à biota estão o enredamento, a ingestão e o possível transporte marinho de invertebrados 

incrustantes que se fixam à superfície dos plásticos (Moore 2008, Barnes et al. 2009).  

Nos ambientes costeiros e marinhos, os macroplásticos começam a sofrer sucessivos processos 

de degradação, induzidos principalmente pela luz do sol (processos foto-oxidativos). Com sua 

estrutura molecular fragilizada, os plásticos começam então a se fragmentar em pedaços cada vez 

menores, em um processo lento mas significativo (Barnes et al. 2009, Costa et al. 2009, Ivar do Sul 

et al. 2009, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014), que ocorre provavelmente até atingir o nível molecular, 

quando estes já se encontram descaracterizados em relação ao polímero inicial/precursor. 

Recentemente (~5 anos) a comunidade científica especializada vem concentrando seus 

esforços na identificação, caracterização e quantificação, em escala global, de fragmentos plásticos 

de pequenas dimensões (&lt;5 mm), denominados microplásticos (por exemplo, Browne et al. 2011). 

Algumas definições já foram amplamente aceitas por esta comunidade, destacando-se a classificação 

dos microplásticos pela sua fonte ou origem (Arthur et al. 2009). Esférulas de plástico virgens e 



2 

 

outras partículas que chegam aos ambientes costeiros e marinhos por derramamentos acidentais 

durante o manuseio e transporte e/ou sistemas de drenagens de esgotos (Moore 2008, Fendal e 

Sewell 2009), já com forma e tamanho definidos, foram classificadas como primárias (fontes 

primárias). Já as partículas plásticas, formadas no ambiente por contínuos processos de degradação e 

fragmentação, foram classificadas como secundárias (fontes secundárias).  

Dezenas de estudos confirmam a presença de microplásticos flutuantes nos Oceanos Pacífico 

Norte, Pacífico Sul, Mediterrâneo e Atlântico Norte (Cole et al. 2011, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). É 

possível que, por fatores oceanográficos, estes microplásticos se concentrem principalmente no 

centro dos giros subtropicais (Moore et al. 2001). Nos sedimentos de praias arenosas, microplásticos 

foram amostrados em pelo menos seis continentes. Aparentemente, regiões próximas às 

aglomerações urbanas apresentaram maiores concentrações, indicando a possível influência dos 

sistemas de drenagem de esgotos (Browne et al. 2011).  

Os microplásticos são ainda mais pervasivos que os resíduos plásticos grandes quando estão no 

ambiente marinho, atingindo praticamente todos os níveis da teia trófica através de sua ingestão 

(Wright et al. 2013, Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). Poluentes orgânicos, como DDTs e PCBs, e 

inorgânicos presentes na água do mar podem adsorver-se a estes microplásticos (Mato et al. 2001), 

transportando contaminantes químicos para diversas regiões do globo incluindo os polos (Zarfl e 

Matthies 2010), ou sendo liberados no trato gastrointestinal de vertebrados e invertebrados quando 

ingeridos (Tanaka et al. 2013), sendo então transferidos ao longo da teia trófica marinha.  

No Brasil, estudos com resíduos plásticos em ambientes costeiros são realizados desde o final 

da década de 1990 (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2007). Porém, estudos sistemáticos relacionados à presença 

de microplásticos em praias arenosas começaram somente no final da década de 2000 (Ivar do Sul et 

al. 2009, Costa et al. 2009). Nestes estudos foi identificada, pela primeira vez, a presença de 

esférulas plásticas no Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha, oeste do Oceano Atlântico tropical, e na 

Praia da Boa Viagem, um dos principais destinos turísticos do estado de Pernambuco, NE do Brasil. 

Registros de esférulas plásticas e fragmentos plásticos de pequenas dimensões em Fernando de 

Noronha são um indicativo de que micro partículas de plástico estariam não só depositadas em praias 

arenosas nesta ilha, mas distribuídas em todo oeste do Oceano Atlântico tropical, incluindo outros 

ambientes insulares inseridos no contexto da Amazônia Azul. Entretanto aspectos relacionados à 

poluição destes ambientes por microplásticos eram, até o momento, desconhecidos apesar de serem 

prioritários devido a sua grande importância ecológica e conservacional.  

Seguindo as tendências da comunidade científica internacional para estudos sobre 

microplásticos em ambientes insulares e devido à ausência de estudos na Zona Econômica Exclusiva 

Brasileira, a principal hipótese desta tese de doutorado foi de que microplásticos pelágicos estão 



3 

 

presentes na superfície do mar, em regiões adjacentes às ilhas oceânicas brasileiras, bem como 

depositados em suas praias arenosas. As amostragens foram concentradas em três importantes 

ambientes insulares: o Arquipélago de Fernando de Noronha (3°S, 32°W), o Arquipélago de 

Abrolhos (17°S, 38°W) e a Ilha da Trindade (20°S, 29°W). Plásticos flutuantes foram amostrados, 

pela primeira vez, através de arrastos planctônicos (neuston) nas áreas marinhas adjacentes a estes 

ambientes. As amostras de microplásticos depositados no sedimento foram coletadas nas praias 

arenosas em cada uma das ilhas, seguindo metodologia previamente estabelecida (Ivar do Sul et al. 

2009). 

 

Objetivo geral: identificar e caracterizar a poluição por microplásticos em Fernando de 

Noronha, Abrolhos e Trindade, oeste do Oceano Atlântico tropical.  

 

Objetivos específicos: 

? Identificar e caracterizar a poluição por microplásticos na superfície do mar adjacente 

aos Arquipélagos de Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos e à Ilha da Trindade 

? Identificar e caracterizar a poluição por microplásticos nas praias arenosas dos 

Arquipélagos de Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos e da Ilha da Trindade 

 

Durante todo o curso de Doutorado foi realizada uma extensa revisão da literatura científica 

sobre o tema, sendo acessados mais de centenas de artigos científicos, todos publicados em revistas 

indexadas com revisão por pares. Esta revisão representa o Capítulo I desta tese de Doutorado, 

intitulado “The present and future of microplastic pollution in the marine environment”. De modo 

geral, estudos relacionados à poluição por microplásticos têm seu principal foco nos ambientes 

costeiros e oceânicos onde eles ocorrem, principalmente (1) na superfície do mar; (2) em sedimentos 

arenosos e lamosos; (3) na sua ingestão por organismos invertebrados e vertebrados; (4) nas 

interações com poluentes químicos e, consequentemente, no seu papel na dispersão destes dentro das 

teias tróficas e ao redor do globo. A cada dia novas evidências reiteram a onipresença das 

micropartículas plásticas e, até onde se sabe, não existem barreiras físicas ou biológicas para estes 

poluentes (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014). Entretanto, muitas outras lacunas ainda precisam ser 

preenchidas no que se refere à poluição marinha por microplásticos (Cole et al. 2011, Ivar do Sul e 

Costa 2014). O Capítulo I deste documento começa na página 6, sendo numerado de acordo com a 

paginação da revista Environmental Pollution (ISSN: 0269-7491), onde encontra-se publicado. 

(Environmental Pollution, volume 185, páginas 352-364, 2014).

Um dos aspectos em evidência na literatura especializada consiste na utilização de amostra de 

plâncton já existentes para a caracterização da poluição por microplásticos, principalmente em áreas 

oceânicas onde o acesso é restrito e as amostragens são dispendiosas (Arthur et al. 2009). O uso 

destes “bancos de amostras” preexistentes já tinha sido realizado com sucesso em estudos de larga 

escala no oceano Atlântico Norte (Thompson et al. 2004; Law et al. 2010; Morét-Ferguson et al. 

2010) e foi novamente utilizado nesta tese de Doutorado. Amostras de plâncton coletadas no 

Arquipélago de São Pedro e São Paulo (0°55’N, 29°20’W) foram reanalisadas para identificar e 

caracterizar a poluição por microplásticos neste arquipélago que é um dos mais remotos do Oceano 

Atlântico. Os resultados destes esforços representam o Capítulo II desta tese, intitulado “Pelagic 

microplastics around an archipelago of the Equatorial Atlantic”. O uso de amostras preexistentes 

mostrou-se novamente eficiente na identificação de microplásticos, além de representar uma 

importante oportunidade para acertar os passos metodológicos para a coleta, manipulação e análise 

das amostras da tese. Este artigo foi apresentado e aprovado em agosto de 2012 como exame de 

Qualificação, um dos pré-requisitos para a obtenção do título de Doutor em Oceanografia. O 

Capítulo II deste documento começa na página 7, sendo numerado de acordo com a paginação da 

revista Marine Pollution Bulletin (ISSN: 0025-326X), onde encontra-se publicado (Marine Pollution 

Bulletin, volume 75, páginas 305-309, 2013).  

A revisão da literatura (Ivar do Sul e Costa 2014) também guiou a composição dos demais 

capítulos desta tese de Doutorado e os assuntos encontram-se abordados na ordem histórica; 

primeiramente os resultados dos arrastos de plâncton, cujos registros datam do início da década de 

1970 (por exemplo, Buchanan 1971, Carpenter e Smith 1972), seguidos pelos resultados da 

amostragem de sedimentos nas praias arenosas (por exemplo, Gregory 1977).  

O Capítulo III apresenta os resultados dos arrastos de plâncton realizados na superfície do 

mar, em áreas adjacentes às ilhas estudadas, sob o título “Microplastics in the pelagic environment 

around oceanic islands of the Western Tropical Atlantic Ocean”. Nos arrastos de plâncton, optou-

se pela rede neustônica, que amostra os primeiros centímetros da coluna d’água, onde estão maioria 

dos plásticos flutuantes. A estrutura da rede foi inspirada em um modelo já existente e amplamente 

utilizado pela comunidade científica internacional, buscando-se garantir a melhor eficiência nas 

coletas. Este modelo foi inicialmente desenvolvido pelo Capitão Charles Moore, fundador da 

Fundação Algalita (Califórnia, EUA). Foram feitas algumas modificações para que a rede fosse 

desmontável, facilitando o manuseio e transporte entre as ilhas pesquisadas. Atualmente, novas 

tecnologias foram desenvolvidas e aplicadas às redes neustônicas, inclusive pelo Cap. Charles 

Moore, e encontram-se disponíveis no mercado. Adicionalmente, sabe-se que os plásticos podem 

estar também distribuídos ao longo da coluna d’água, sendo necessário o desenvolvimento de 



5 

 

técnicas que permitam a amostragem em diferentes camadas de profundidade. Outra questão que 

vem sendo amplamente discutida pela comunidade internacional é a proporção relativa da poluição 

por plásticos em distintas categorias de tamanho, destacando-se os nanoplásticos (1000X menores 

que os microplásticos). A utilização de uma rede tipo bongo, com diferentes tamanhos de malha (ex. 

200µm, 64µm) poderia contribuir para o esclarecimento desta questão. Estes novos resultados 

demandariam novos procedimentos de coleta e de laboratório para a identificação e manuseio dos 

microplásticos amostrados. Quanto menor o tamanho dos plásticos estudados, maior a necessidade 

de cuidados com a possível contaminação das amostras, tanto em campo (fragmentos da rede 

utilizada durante as coletas, por exemplo) quanto em laboratório, através do ar, das roupas e 

instrumentos de laboratório, durante os procedimentos analíticos. O Capítulo III deste documento

Recently, research examining the occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment has substan-
tially increased. Field and laboratory work regularly provide new evidence on the fate of microplastic
debris. This debris has been observed within every marine habitat. In this study, at least 101 peer-
reviewed papers investigating microplastic pollution were critically analysed (Supplementary
material). Microplastics are commonly studied in relation to (1) plankton samples, (2) sandy and
muddy sediments, (3) vertebrate and invertebrate ingestion, and (4) chemical pollutant interactions. All
of the marine organism groups are at an eminent risk of interacting with microplastics according to the
available literature. Dozens of works on other relevant issues (i.e., polymer decay at sea, new sampling
and laboratory methods, emerging sources, externalities) were also analysed and discussed. This paper
provides the first in-depth exploration of the effects of microplastics on the marine environment and
biota. The number of scientific publications will increase in response to present and projected plastic
uses and discard patterns. Therefore, new themes and important approaches for future work are
proposed.

1. Introduction

In 1972, E. J. Carpenter and K. L. Smith became the first re-
searchers to sound the alarm on the presence of plastic pellets on
the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. In their publication in
Science, they stated: “The increasing production of plastic, combined
with present waste-disposal practices, will probably lead to greater
concentrations on the sea surface. At present, the only known bio-
logical effect of these particles is that they act as a surface for the
growth of hydroids, diatoms, and probably bacteria”. Not surprisingly,
only months later, the ingestion of those same polyethylene pellets
by fish was reported (Carpenter et al., 1972). The prediction by
Carpenter and Smith (1972) is the focus of the scientific community
that is studying the smallest plastic debris pollution sizes (Moore,
2008; Barnes et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2009; Ryan et al.,
2009; Andrady, 2011). Several million tonnes of plastics have
been produced since the middle of the last century (more than two
hundred million tonnes annually) (Barnes et al., 2009; Thompson
et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011). Speculation exists over how much of

this plastic will end up in the ocean, where it suffers degradation
and fragmentation (Barnes et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011). In the
environment, microplastic debris (&lt;5 mm) proliferates, migrates
and accumulates in natural habitats from pole to pole and from the
ocean surface to the seabed; the debris is also deposited on urban
beaches and pristine sediments (Moore, 2008; Barnes et al., 2009;
Thompson et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2009). This type of pollution is
ubiquitous and persistent in the world’s oceans and openly
threatens marine biota.

Plastic means “malleable” or “flexible”. Indeed, these synthetic
materials can be moulded into virtually any shape (Moore, 2008).
Plastics are versatile materials that are inexpensive, lightweight,
strong, durable and corrosion-resistant. They have high thermal
and electrical insulation values (Thompson et al., 2009) and are
incredibly practical. Plastics are formed by long chains of polymeric
molecules that are created from organic and inorganic raw mate-
rials, such as carbon, silicon, hydrogen, oxygen and chloride; these
materials are usually obtained from oil, coal and natural gas (Shah
et al., 2008). Currently, the most widely used synthetic plastics are
low- and high-density polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET). Altogether, these plastics represent w90% of the
total world production (Andrady and Neal, 2009). Thus, it is widely

J.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 353
accepted that the majority of the items polluting coastal and ma-
rine environments are comprised of these materials (Andrady,
2011; Engler, 2012).

Most synthetic polymers are buoyant in water (e.g., PE and PP).
Consequently, substantial quantities of plastic debris that are
buoyant enough to float in seawater are transported and eventually
washed ashore (Thompson et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011; Engler,
2012). The polymers that are denser than seawater (e.g., PVC)
tend to settle near the point where they entered the environment;
however, they can still be transported by underlying currents
(Engler, 2012). Additionally, microbial films rapidly develop on
submerged plastics and change their physicochemical properties
(i.e., surface hydrophobicity and buoyancy) (Lobelle and Cunliffe,
2011). If these fragments sink, then the seabed becomes the ulti-
mate repository for the plastics (including those that were initially
buoyant) (Barnes et al., 2009).

Polymers are rarely used as pure substances. Typically, resins are
mixed with additives to enhance their performance (Andrady and
Neal, 2009; Teuten et al., 2009). Considerable controversy exists
over the extent to which additives that are released from plastic
products (e.g., phthalates and bisphenol A) adversely affect animals
and humans (Andrady and Neal, 2009; Thompson et al., 2009;
Teuten et al., 2009; Lithner et al., 2009, 2011). More information
is available from Thompson et al. (2009) and Cole et al. (2011),
among others.

Additionally, the hydrophobic pollutants available in seawater
may adsorb onto plastic debris in ordinary environmental condi-
tions (Thompson et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2011). The majority of
these pollutants are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic; thus,
they are of particular concern for human and environmental health
(Engler, 2012). Plastics not only have the potential to transport
contaminants, but they can also increase their environmental
persistence (Teuten et al., 2009). This highlights the importance of
plastic as vehicles of pollutants to marine biota and humans
(Teuten et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2013).

Small plastics enter the environment directly, whereas larger
items are continuously fragmenting (Barnes et al., 2009). Primary-
sourced microplastics (Arthur et al., 2009) are directly released to
the environment in the form of small (mm) pellets that are used as
abrasives in industrial (shot blasting) (Gregory, 1996) and domestic
applications (e.g., Fendall and Sewell, 2009); theycan also be released
by spilling virgin plastic pellets (mm) (Thompson et al., 2009). Facial
cleansers that are used by millions of people, especially in developed
countries, contain PS particles (mm) that directly enter sewage sys-
tems and adjacent coastal environments (Zitko and Hanlon, 1991;
Gregory, 1996; Fendall and Sewell, 2009). Moreover, laboratory ex-
periments using Sphaeroma quoianun indicated that isopods can
produce millions of PS fragments, which resemble plastic pellets,
when incrusted in buoys in the Pacific Ocean (Davidson, 2012).

Larger plastics eventually undergo some form of degradation
and subsequent fragmentation, which leads to the formation of
small pieces (Shah et al., 2008; Costa et al., 2010; Andrady, 2011).
Degradation is a chemical change that reduces the average mo-
lecular weight of polymers (Andrady, 2011). The most-used poly-
mer types (i.e., PE and PP) have high molecular weights and are
non-biodegradable (Shah et al., 2008). However, once in the ma-
rine environment, they start to suffer photo-oxidative degradation
by UV solar radiation, followed by thermal and/or chemical
degradation. This renders plastics susceptible to further microbial
action (i.e., biodegradation) (Shah et al., 2008; Andrady, 2011). The
light-induced oxidation is orders of magnitude higher than other
types of degradation (Andrady, 2011). Any significant extent of
degradation inevitably weakens the plastic, and the material
become brittle enough to fall apart into powdery fragments
(Andrady, 2011) when subjected to sea motion. This process
essentially occurs forever (Barnes et al., 2009), including on the
molecular level (Andrady, 2011).

Reports of plastics have spread rapidly in terms of geography,
marine habitat and biota influenced (Barnes et al., 2009; Ryan et al.,
2009). It was hypothesised that microplastics accumulate in the
centres of subtropical gyres, but their means of movement and
transport in the sea are largely unknown (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012),
especially along the vertical axis. Environmental microplastics are
available to every level of the food web, from primary producers
(Oliveira et al., 2012) to higher trophic-level organisms (Wright
et al., 2013). Individuals who ingest microplastics may suffer
physical harm, such as internal abrasion and blockage. Impacts at
the population-level are also possible, but largely unknown
(Wright et al., 2013). Plastic pellets are also used as ovipositon sites
by insects, such as Halobates micans and H. sericeus, which can
affect their abundance and dispersion (Majer et al., 2012; Goldstein
et al., 2012). In the western Atlantic, 24% of the pellets (N &gt; 1000)
had eggs attached to their surface, most with viable embryos. In the
North Pacific Ocean, the numbers of adults, juveniles and eggs
(H. sericeus) were significantly correlated with microplastic abun-
dance. Although it is still risky to conclude the magnitude of this
problem (i.e., transport of fouling species), it is fair to consider
plastics as potential vectors that transport species to previously
unknown mobility levels (Barnes et al., 2009).

As predicted (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1972), microplastic pollution
becamewidespread with significant implications for ecosystems and
organisms in a variety of forms. Supporting evidence has been pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals from the 1971 benchmark paper by
Buchanan (1971) to the present. In this context, the present work
aims to sort, critically analyse, and synthesise the recent literature
regarding microplastics at sea, as well as highlight the risks to and
effects on the marine biota. The Arthur et al. (2009) definition of
microplastics was adopted (fragments and primary-sourced plastics
that are smaller than 5 mm) as the main criteria for discerning a
specific size class of plastic pollution. A periodic criticalassessmentof
this issue is essential, especially because the problem is mounting
and will persist for centuries, even if pollution is immediately
stopped (Barnes et al., 2009).

2. Results

Results from the scientific literature were classified according to
the main focus of each work: (1) the presence of microplastics in
plankton samples; (2) the presence of microplastics in sandy and
muddy sediments; (3) the ingestion of microplastics by vertebrates
and invertebrates; (4) microplastics’ interactions with chemical
pollutants (see the supplementary content in Tables S1, S2, S3, S4
and S5). Papers in each category were analysed for their most
relevant findings to improve and advance discussions on micro-
plastics at sea.

One hundred and one documents from various sources fulfilled
the review criteria (Table 1). Two works were included in more than
one category: Carpenter et al. (1972) and Thompson et al. (2004).
Fourteen literature reviews, from 2008 to 2013, on microplastics in
the marine environment were also consulted. Research related to
the development of new sampling or laboratory methods and/or
analytical procedures, the (bio)degradation of plastics and other
relevant issues were used when appropriated. Approximately 80%
of the articles were published in the last 15 years, and more than
60% of the articles were published in the last 5 years.

plastics is well-established (Carpenter and Smith, 1972; Carpenter
et al., 1972; Morris and Hamilton, 1974; Wilber, 1987; Ryan, 1988)
(Table S1). While sampling the pelagic sargassum community in
the early 1970s, Carpenter and his team observed high quantities of
polystyrene plastic pellets (1e2 mm) on the sea surface of the
western North Atlantic Ocean. Most pellets had hydroids and di-
atoms attached to their surfaces (Carpenter and Smith, 1972). Pre-
viously, the only evidence of synthetic microplastic fibres were
reported in membrane-filtered water samples from the North Sea
(Buchanan, 1971). Archived plankton samples from the North
Atlantic Ocean, which are regularly obtained with a continuous
plankton recorder (CPR) between Aberdeen and the Shetlands and
from Sule Skerry to Iceland, also revealed the presence of micro-
plastics in the 1960s (Thompson et al., 2004). Furthermore, these
samples indicated a significant increase in the abundance of
microplastics (mainly fibrous and 20 mm in length) during the
1960e1970s and 1980e1990s (Thompson et al., 2004).

In the western North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, a wide-
range ship-survey dataset (w6100 tows) also reported the quan-
tities and characteristics of pelagic plastics (Law et al., 2010). Plastic
fragments, 88% of which were smaller than 10 mm, were sampled
between 22 and 38?N. This finding reflects the presence of a large-
scale subtropical convergence zone. Chemical analysis revealed
that 99% of the particles were less dense than seawater: high- and
low-density PE, PP (Law et al., 2010) and plastic pellets. Using a
subset of these samples (Law et al., 2010), Kukulka et al. (2012)
developed a theoretical model that indicates that the plastics ob-
tained from surface tows are dependent on wind speed (i.e., tows in
high wind conditions tend to capture fewer plastic pieces) because
plastics are vertically distributed in the mixed layer due to wind
(Kukulka et al., 2012). Around the Saint Peter and Saint Paul ar-
chipelago in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, plastic fragments
(N ¼ 71; w85% smaller than 5 mm) were retained near the
seamount, as well as reef fish and semi-terrestrial decapod larvae
(Ivar do Sul et al., 2013). Despite its isolation, the archipelago is not
free of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of plastics, which
may be ingested by the biota.

In the North Atlantic Ocean (11e44?N, 55e71?W), more than
18,000 archived surface net tows were analysed, which allowed
researchers to investigate the spatial and temporal trends (1991e
2007), as well as the visual characteristics, of pelagic microplastics
(Morét-Ferguson et al., 2010). Sixty per cent of the fragments were
2e6 mm. Apparently, the densities (g ml?1) of the plastic pellets
decreased, but the quantities of the fragments increased 18% over
the time period (Morét-Ferguson et al., 2010). The microplastics
were sampled significantly higher at 30?N, the subtropical
convergence zone. Furthermore, neustonic samples collected in the
Mediterranean Sea indicated that the closed basin is also threat-
ened by microplastic pollution (Collignon et al., 2012). Ninety per
cent (N ¼ 40) of the samples contained plastics (0.3e5 mm), which
were mostly fibres, PS fragments and films. The microplastic con-
centrations were 5 times higher before a strong wind event than
after the event. Researchers suggested that wind stress might
redistribute plastics in the upper layers of the water column and
prevent them from being sampled by the surface tows (Collignon
et al., 2012). Recently, the occurrence of suspended plastic pellets
and fibres was reported in the Jade System of the southern North
Sea. The pellets were associated with a paper recycling plant,
whereas the fibres were most likely sewage-related (Dubaish and
Liebezeit, 2013).

In the Pacific Ocean, plankton tows performed in the 1980s
revealed high amounts of coloured microplastic fragments (Shaw
and Day, 1994). The North Pacific Central Gyre (NPCG) was sampled
for the first time at the turn of the XXIst Century (Moore et al., 2001).
The surface tows collected plastic fragments, thin films and mono-
filament lines, the majority of which were smaller than 5 mm. A large
plastic to plankton ratio was reported. However, the NPCG is not an
area of high biological productivity, and the extrapolation of these
findings to other oceanic areas is somewhat limited.

Surface plankton tows were carried out in southern California’s
coastal waters (Moore et al., 2002). Higher quantities of plastics
(mainly small fragments) were sampled after a storm event, which
resulted in a high plastic to plankton ratio (Moore et al., 2002).
Plastics were also sampled throughout the water column (surface,
middle and bottom) in Santa Monica Bay, California, before and
after a storm (Lattin et al., 2004). Unexpectedly, the densities of the
plastics were not the highest at the surface, but instead were the
highest near the bottom. Higher amounts were sampled after a
storm, especially close to the shore, which reflects the inputs from
land-based runoff and re-suspended sediments (Lattin et al., 2004).
In another study, microplastics were collected on the surface, rather
than at subsurface layers, of the North Pacific Ocean (the Bering Sea
and off the coast of southern California). The authors emphasise
that microplastics (fragments, fishing lines/fibres and virgin plastic
pellets) were concentrated near the surface due to their buoyancy
in seawater (Doyle et al., 2011).

In the western Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Kuroshio Cur-
rent (30e34?N, 133e139?W), plastic and PS fragments were



J.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 355
identified in surface plankton tows (Yamashita and Tanimura,
2007). Seventy-two per cent of the sampled stations contained
fragments, many of which measured w3 mm. Plastic pellets rep-
resented&amp;lt;1% of the total sampled items. The surface microlayers
(50e60 mm) and subsurface layers (1 m) around Singapore were
also reported to be contaminated by PE, PP and PS microplastics (Ng
and Obbard, 2006).

The Southern Hemisphere is likely contaminated by floating
plastic debris, as predicted by a recent mathematical computational
model (Maximenko et al., 2012). Based on these findings, Eriksen
et al. (2013) conducted a specific surface survey in the South Pa-
cific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG), where 96% of the samples revealed
the presence of plastics. The majority of the plastics (88.8% of the
total weight) were microplastic fragments (1e5 mm) that were
collected between 97 and 111?W. The total amount of sampled
plastics was lower than that in the NPCG (Moore et al., 2001), but
both gyres contained similar sized fragments. A possible inverse
relationship exists between plastic counts (or weight) and the sea
conditions (Kukulka et al., 2012; Collignon et al., 2012).

2.2. Sandy and muddy sediments

Microplastics on sandy beaches were first reported in the form
of plastic pellets in New Zealand, Canada, Bermuda and Lebanon
(Gregory,1977,1978,1983; Shiber,1979) (Table S2). In New Zealand,
the pellets were translucent, 2e5 mm in size and related to acci-
dental spillages at the major ports (Gregory, 1977, 1978). These
characteristics were also observed for PE pellets sampled on bea-
ches in Canada, Bermuda and Lebanon. Many of the pellets showed
deterioration due to weathering (Gregory, 1983). Plastic pellets
have also been reported on beaches at the Gulf of Oman, the
Arabian Gulf (Khordagui and Abu-Hilal,1994) and the Maltese coast
of the Central Mediterranean (Turner and Holmes, 2011). On the
Arabian coast, large numbers of stranded pellets and the presence
of entire bags indicated that a massive spill most likely occurred
during shipping. Some of the PE pellets observed in the Mediter-
ranean were embedded in tar. Recently, Fotopoulou and
Karapanagioti (2012) investigated the superficial characteristics of
plastic pellets; they revealed that the surfaces of virgin pellets are
smooth and uniform, whereas the surfaces of stranded and eroded
PS and PP pellets are rough and uneven. The PS pellets found in the
environment had enlarged surface areas and were more polar,
which indicates that they more efficiently interact with a variety
chemical compounds compared with virgin pellets (Fotopoulou
and Karapanagioti, 2012).

It seems that plastic resin pellets were already distributed
worldwide in the 1970s (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Nowadays, other
types of microplastics are also reported globally (Browne et al.,
2011). Microplastics are reportedly present on six continents, and
higher amounts are commonly related to densely populated areas.
In a study of the types (mostly fibres) and materials (frequently
polyester and acrylic) of microplastics, Browne et al. (2011) sug-
gested that the plastics were produced by sewage effluents,
including wastewater from washing machines.

By analysing sediments from 18 beaches around the UK,
Thompson et al. (2004) most often observed polymers in the form
of fibres. Microplastics (&lt;1 mm) were also present in sediment
samples from the Tamar Estuary, UK (Browne et al., 2010). PVC,
polyester and polyamide comprised w80% of the total sampled
fragments and were generally more common at downwind sites.

On the Belgium coast, the sediment from beaches, harbours and
sub-littoral habitats were found to be contaminated with micro-
plastics (38 mme1 mm). In general, plastic fibres were more com-
mon than pellets, except in harbour areas (Claessens et al., 2011).
The sediment cores from sandy beaches revealed that microplastic
deposition tripled over the last 20 years (Claessens et al., 2011). In
the North Sea, microplastics were quantified on beach and tidal flat
habitats on the East Frisian Islands (Liebezeit and Dubaish, 2012).
Pellets (&lt;100 mm) and fibres were present, but plastic fragments
and PS pellets were completely absent. The tidal flats were more
contaminated, mostly by pellets, than the sandy beaches.

At the Lagoon of Venice, Italy (Vianello et al., 2013), 10 different
polymers that measured 30e500 mm were successfully identified
by mFT-IR (Harrison et al., 2012). PS and PP were prevalent. Spatially,
microplastic particles tend to accumulate in low hydrodynamism
sites (such as the inner lagoon) in a similar manner to fine sediment
fractions (Vianello et al., 2013).

The presence of small-sized plastics on Hawaiian beaches is
expected because the archipelago is located in the NPCG. All of the
sediment samples from the islands were contaminated, primarily
by plastic fragments (87%) but also by resin pellets (11%)
(McDermid and McMullen, 2004). The strand line was significantly
more contaminated when compared to the berm. The samples
measured 2.8e5 mm; however, on remote beaches, such as Cargo
Beach in the Midway Atoll, the majority of the sampled plastics
were even smaller. Another heavily polluted beach in the Hawaiian
Archipelago is Kamilo Beach, where plastic fragments mostly occur
(95%) in the top 15 cm of the sediment cores (Carson et al., 2011).
Artificial sediment cores were constructed, and they indicated that
higher amounts of fragments increase the permeability of the
sediment and change its maximum temperature, which causes the
sediments to warm more slowly. This can affect the sex of
temperature-determinant organisms, such as sea turtles (e.g., a
reduction in the number of females) (Carson et al., 2011).

In the Pacific Ocean (Chile), a volunteer survey revealed that
microplastic fragments (1e4.75 mm) occurred in 90% of the beach
samples (N ¼ 39), including those from Easter Island. There, higher
abundances of smaller fragments were registered (Hidalgo-Ruz and
Thiel, 2013).

Near the Sea of Japan (Kusui and Noda, 2003), plastic fragments
and pellets were reported on Japanese beaches. However, plastic
resin pellets were absent from Russian beaches. The presence of
buried fragments indicates that surveys might underestimate the
quantities of stranded microplastics on sandy beaches (Kusui and
Noda, 2003). In the Indian Ocean, the presence of microplastics and
other materials in coastal sediments were reported in India (Reddy
et al., 2006) and Singapore (Ng and Obbard, 2006). Polyurethane,
Nylon, PS and polyester were identified in inter-tidal environments
on the western coast of India (Reddy et al., 2006). In Singapore,
microplastics, mostly with secondary sources, were prevalent on
tourist beaches (east coast) (Ng and Obbard, 2006) (Table S2).

In the western South Atlantic Ocean, plastic pellets have been
present on the continental shores for many years (e.g., Ivar do Sul
and Costa, 2007). The occurrence of plastic fragments was docu-
mented over the last three decades, but not systematically. The
studies were usually related to macro categories of plastic debris.
Currently, the research focuses on microplastic debris (Ivar do Sul
et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2010; Fisner et al., 2013). Microplastics
(mostly hard fragments) were reported on the beaches of Fernando
de Noronha Archipelago (3?S, 32?W). Virgin plastic pellets have
only been spotted on windward beaches, which highlights their
oceanic origins. Microplastics pose a serious risk to the resident and
migrant biota, especially endemic species (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).
At Boa Viagem Beach (8?S), an important tourist destination in the
region, primary- and secondary-sourced microplastics were pre-
sent (Costa et al., 2010). The authors emphasised that beach
cleaning services cannot target this size category. Thus, the only
abatement method is to reduce the amount of microplastics that
enter the marine and coastal environments. New methods and
techniques aimed at improving microplastic research and the

standardisation of sampling protocols are continually being
developed (e.g., Imhof et al., 2012; Claessens et al., 2011; Harrison
et al., 2012).

2.3. Ingestion of microplastics

The ingestion of microplastics has been documented for verte-
brate and invertebrate marine species (Tables S3 and S4). The in-
teractions between microplastics and marine vertebrates were
discovered and primarily reported from opportunistic sampling.
However, for invertebrates, the research is somewhat restricted to
controlled laboratory experiments (Table 2).

2.4. Vertebrates

The ingestion of microplastics by teleost fish was discovered
many years ago (Carpenter et al.,1972; Hoss and Settle,1990). In the
early 1970s, Carpenter et al. (1972) reported the presence of plastics
(&lt;5 mm) in larvae and juvenile Pseudopleuronects flounder in the
North Atlantic Ocean. Adults (Morone america and Pronotus evolans)
were also found to ingest plastic pellets. Furthermore, controlled
laboratory experiments were performed (Hoss and Settle, 1990) in
which six different species of fish in early life stages were fed 100e
500 mm pellets; all of the fish ingested the microplastics. These
early works were the first to detect and report this level of inter-
action between microplastics and the marine biota.

Recently, concerns over the ingestion of microplastics emerged
when synthetic fragments were found in the gastrointestinal con-
tent from 35% (N ¼ 670) of the planktivorous fish in the NPCG
(Boerger et al., 2010; Table S3). Quantitatively, the average number
of plastic pieces ingested (1e2.79 mm) increased with the fish size.
The colours of the plastics collected in the marine environment
during sampling revealed similar percentages to those of the
ingested plastics (Boerger et al., 2010). This similarity may indicate
that there is no colour-based selectivity by lantern fish (Mycto-
phidae) during feeding. Pelagic and demersal fish inhabiting the
coastal waters around the UK were also found with synthetic and
semi-synthetic plastics from sewage sources in their digestive
tracts. Thirty-six percent (N ¼ 504) mostly ingested fibres (68%) and
microplastic fragments (Lusher et al., 2013).

In the North Pacific, mesopelagic fish (9%; N ¼ 141), including
Myctophidae, were also contaminated with microplastic fragments
(w2.2 mm) and fibres (Davison and Asch, 2011). Lantern fish were
also found with plastics in their stomach contents (w40%) at the
Mariana Islands (Philippines Sea). Unlike the NPCG, the Marianna
Islands are not a hotspot of microplastic debris, which illustrates
the magnitude of the problem (Van Noord, 2013).

It is well-established that estuarine environments around the
world are affected by microplastic pollution (Browne et al., 2011),
and their resident fish are at risk of interacting with this pollutant.
In a small estuary in the western South Atlantic Ocean, catfishes
(Ariidae), estuarine drums (Sciaenidae) and mojarras (Gerreidae)
have been reported to have synthetic polymers in their digestive

tracts (Possatto et al., 2011; Dantas et al., 2012; Ramos et al., 2012;
Table S3). All of the studied species are benthophagous, which feed
on or just below the sediment surface. These species most
frequently ingest blue nylon threads. For catfishes (N ¼ 182), the
ingestion of plastic debris appeared to vary according to the onto-
genetic phase (except for Cathorops agassizii) (Possatto et al., 2011).
Approximately 8% (N ¼ 569) of the estuarine drums (adults)
ingested plastic threads during the late rainy season and in the
middle estuary, when higher water fluxes and intense fishery ac-
tivities occurred (Dantas et al., 2012). Among mojarras, 13.4%
(N ¼ 425) were contaminated with synthetic threads. The sources
of microplastics are related to the ingestion of contaminated prey
(e.g., polychaetes), the ingestion of threads during normal suction
feeding, and the active ingestion of plastics with biofilm. The
possible transference of the plastics to the species predators at
higher trophic-levels in the estuarine and coastal food webs was
highlighted (Ramos et al., 2012).

Seabirds have long been known to interact with marine plastic
pollution and have been used to monitor the quantities and
composition of plastic ingestion for at least four decades (e.g., Day
et al., 1984; Fry et al., 1987; Van Franeker and Bell, 1988; Barnes
et al., 2009; Colabuono et al., 2009, 2010). The majority of the
ingested fragments were identified by the naked eye, and macro-
plastics (&gt;5 mm) and microplastics are commonly reported
together. Plastic pellets were identified in migratory petrels,
shearwaters and prions in the 1980s and 2000s in the Atlantic and
south-western Indian oceans (Ryan, 2008). Surprisingly, the pro-
portion of pellets decreased significantly in all five species that
were investigated over the last 20 years. However, because the total
loads of ingested plastics did not vary significantly between de-
cades, the author attributed this change to the enhancement of
secondary-sourced plastics (i.e., fragments) (Ryan, 2008).

Plastic fragments and pellets were identified in two Fulmarus
glacialis colonies in the Canadian Arctic. More than 80% of the ful-
mars ingested fragments (Provencher et al., 2009). This species was
monitored in several regions in the North Sea and the Netherlands
for at least three decades (Table S3). As previously observed by Ryan
(2008), the industrial plastic pellets found in stomachs decreased
by half over 20 years, but the plastic fragments tripled (Van
Franeker et al., 2011). An important finding is that juveniles ate
more plastics than adults (Kühn and van Franeker, 2012) and that
higher quantities of ingested plastics were reported near highly
industrialised areas directly related to fishing and shipping (Van
Franeker et al., 2011). Further north in Iceland, Fulmarus glacialis
were contaminated (Kühn and van Franeker, 2012). Fragmented
plastics were much more common than virgin plastic pellets, which
illustrates the wide-ranging distribution of these pollutants (Kühn
and van Franeker, 2012). However, the percentage of contaminated
birds (79%, N ¼ 58) was low compared to that of birds inhabiting
lower latitudes, most likely because more fragments are available.
This hypothesis was previously suggested by Provencher et al.
(2010) when they were studying Uria lomvia in Nunavut, Canada.
There,11% (N ¼ 186) of the murres ingested plastic fragments, some
of which were too small to be identified by the naked eye. The
authors emphasised that because murres feed below the sea sur-
face, they are not likely to ingest floating plastics. Nonetheless, the
magnitude of plastic pollution in the marine environment is still a
concern (Provencher et al., 2010). Fulmars throughout the eastern
North Pacific Ocean are also highly susceptible to plastics (Avery-
Gomm et al., 2012). More than 90% of samples were found to be
contaminated by microplastics, mostly fragments.

At the Canary Islands, eastern North Atlantic Ocean, fledgling
cory shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) contained plastics (83.5%,
N ¼ 85) in their guts. Because these chicks never feed in the marine
environment, the plastics were certainly regurgitated during



J.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364 357
parental feeding (Rodríguez et al., 2012). Ingested items (nylon
threads) were directly related to commercial fishery activities
because the Canary Islands are one of the most important fishery
grounds in the world. Along the United States east coast, boluses
(N ¼ 589) from Larus glaucescens were collected from an environ-
mentally protected area to study plastics consumption. Twelve per
cent of the boluses were identified as contaminated, mostly by films
(&lt;1 cm) derived from supermarket plastic bags (Lindborg et al.,
2012). In the North Pacific Ocean, albatrosses obtained as by-catch
from fisheries near the Hawaiian Islands were also contaminated.
Phoebastria immutabilis (N ¼ 18; 83.3%) had a higher frequency of
ingested plastic than P. nigripes (N ¼ 29; 52%). Ordinary plastic
fragments and fishing lines comprised the majority of the ingested
items (Gray et al., 2012). Twenty seabirds and other aquatic bird
species that were sampled between British Columbia, Canada, and
Washington contained low contamination rates. Among the com-
mon murres, for example, only 2.7% were found with ingested
plastics. However, many species had small samples, so definitive
conclusions could not be drawn (Avery-Gomm et al., 2013).

The transference of organic pollutants adsorbed onto marine
plastic fragments to vertebrates via ingestion was detected with
Calonectris leucomelas and Puffinus tenuirostris (Teuten et al., 2009;
Tanaka et al., 2013). Streaked shearwater chicks were fed with
pellets that were contaminated by significant amounts of PCBs.
After 7 days, the identification of lower chlorinated congeners of
PCBs, which can be regarded as a sensitive tracer to detect the
contribution from plastic-derived PCBs, verified the transference of
this contaminant from ingested plastics to the biological tissues of
the seabirds (Teuten et al., 2009). Similarly, Tanaka et al. (2013)
measured the concentrations of PBDEs from ingested plastic frag-
ments in the natural prey of birds (fish) and in their adipose tissues.
Two PBDEs congeners were not found in their prey, but were
adsorbed onto the plastics, which indicate the transfer of plastic-
derived chemicals to the seabird (Tanaka et al., 2013).

For marine mammals, research related to the ingestion of
microplastics is restricted. By analysing fur seal (Arctocephalus
tropicalis and A. gazella) scats collected on Macquaire Island,
Eriksson and Burton (2003) identified pellet and plastic fragment
(2e5 mm) contamination. The authors related the ingested plastics
to the animal’s prey, Electrona subaspera, which had previously
ingested plastics from seawater (Eriksson and Burton, 2003).
Recently, scats collected from Phoca vitulina in The Netherlands did
not contain microplastics. However, 107 stomachs and 100 in-
testines that were analysed were contaminated (11% and 1%,
respectively), mostly by sheets and threads (Rebolledo et al., 2013).
To our knowledge, only a single study investigated the impacts of
microplastics on cetaceans (Fossi et al., 2012). The authors sug-
gested that fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) ingest microplastics
because of the concentration of phthalates in their blubber, which
are linked to the pollutants measured on marine microplastics
sampled in the same area of the Mediterranean Sea where the
whales live and feed (Fossi et al., 2012) (Table S3).

2.5. Invertebrates

After identifying plastics in plankton samples and sedimen-
tary habitats, Thompson et al. (2004) investigated whether in-
vertebrates ingest microplastics in the environment. The authors
observed that amphipods (Orchestia gammarellus), lugworms
(Arenicola marina) and barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides)
ingested microplastics within a few days of exposure. This was
the first of a series of works on the ingestion of microplastics by
marine invertebrates (mainly molluscs, crustaceans, annelids
and echinoderms) using controlled laboratory experiments
(Table 2).
Among the well-established model organisms, Mytilus edulis is
the most commonly studied in terms of microplastic ingestion
(Table S4). These mussels ingested and accumulated microplastics
(&lt;1 mm) within 12 h of the experiment start time (Browne et al.,
2008). High quantities of microplastics (mostly&amp;lt;3 mm) were
found in the hemolymph until the 12th day. Recently, the presence
of HDPE (?80 mm) in gills and inside the digestive system of
M. edulis was also investigated (von Moos et al., 2012). The authors
observed microplastics in the gills, that were trapped directly from
the water column. Microplastics were also in the intestines, which
suggests that particles were ingested via ciliar movements and then
transferred to this organ (von Moos et al., 2012). Moreover, mussels
ingested even smaller (30 nm) fragments. The experiment results
indicated that nanoplastics were also ingested by M. edulis, which
triggered the production of pseudofeces and reduced their filtering
activities (Wegner et al., 2012). The authors emphasised the risks to
humans when eating blue mussels. In fact, the transference of
microplastics from M. edulis to higher trophic levels (Carcinus
maenas) has already been registered (Farrell and Nelson, 2012).
Microplastics can even translocate to the hemolymph and tissues of
the crabs. Therefore, the implications are evident for the rest of the
food web (Farrell and Nelson, 2012), including for humans (Wegner
et al., 2012). Braid et al. (2012) opportunistically found another
mollusc, a cephalopod, which has ingested microplastics. Hum-
boldt squids (Dosidicus gigas), observed during a mass stranding,
ingested pellets and fishing lines (26%; N ¼ 30). This exemplifies the
growing concern over the accumulation of plastics in the marine
environment (Braid et al., 2012).

Another animal group that has been studied in terms of
microplastic ingestion is Holothuria (Graham and Thompson,
2009). Deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding sea cucumbers
selectively ingest nylon and PVC fragments (0.25e15 mm) over
sediment grains. Because plastics concomitantly collected in the
study area (USA) were contaminated with organic pollutants, the
ingestion of plastics could initiate a new pathway of PCB exposure
and cycling within the marine communities (Graham and
Thompson, 2009), which could possibly reach human populations.

Studies concerning microplastic ingestion by benthic crusta-
ceans are limited (Thompson et al., 2004; Murray and Cowie, 2011;
Ugolini et al., 2013). In the Clyde Sea, eighty-three per cent of the
sampled lobsters (N ¼ 120) contained microplastics, mainly fila-
ments in the form of balls, in their stomachs (Murray and Cowie,
2011). A visual analysis revealed that the material of these balls is
the same (PP) found on the ropes used by the fishing industry for
catching Nephrops. In the laboratory, lobsters also ingested plastic
seeds in the first 24 h after exposure (Murray and Cowie, 2011).
Talitrus saltator was found to ingest PE and PP microplastics on
sandy shores in Pisa (Italy). In the laboratory, experiments
confirmed they are able to ingest microplastics when feeding and
expel the plastic within one week (Ugolini et al., 2013).

Thirteen zooplankton taxa, mainly crustaceans (Copepoda,
Euphausiacea and Decapoda) and Tunicata, Cnidaria and Mollusca,
ingested microplastics (1.7e30.6 mm) under laboratory conditions
(Cole et al., 2013). Among copepods, the presence of microplastics
significantly reduced feeding, which illustrates the negative im-
pacts of microplastics on zooplankton communities (Cole et al.,
2013).

Information concerning the uptake of microplastics and its im-
plications for polychaetes also exist (Thompson et al., 2004). In a
laboratory experiment, Arenicola marina ingested PS microplastics
(400e1300 mm); the authors established a positive relationship
between the microplastic concentration in the sediment and the
ingestion of plastics and the weight loss by the lugworm (Besseling
et al., 2013). Feeding activity was also reduced. Despite these
physical impacts, the microplastics did not accumulate in their



J.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364358
digestive tracts during the experiment (28 days). The ingestion of
PS (small doses) by A. marina was associated with higher concen-
trations of PCBs in their tissues (Besseling et al., 2013).

2.6. Adsorption of pollutants onto microplastic particles

PP resin pellets collected along the Japanese coast were enriched
with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorines (DDE) and
nonylphenols (NP) absorbed from seawater (Mato et al., 2001;
Ogata et al., 2009) (Table S5). The concentrations were compara-
ble to those found in suspended particles and bottom sediments
collected in the same area. Plastic additives and/or their degrada-
tion products were most likely the major source of NP (Mato et al.,
2001). Individual analysis of PCBs revealed that concentrations are
highly variable among individual pellets and locations along the
Japanese coast (Endo et al., 2005; Ogata et al., 2009). Additionally,
discoloured (weathered) pellets generally exhibited higher con-
centration of PCBs than coloured pellets.

Near Lisbon, along the Portuguese coast, black, white, coloured
and aged pellets were analysed separately for PCBs, polycyclic ar-
omatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and DDTs (Frias et al., 2010). The black
pellets exhibited higher concentrations of PCBs than aged pellets,
possibly because they have higher adsorption rates (Frias et al.,
2010). Latitudinal surveys revealed that organic chemical pollut-
ants were present along the entire Portuguese coastline (Ogata
et al., 2009; Mizukawa et al., 2013). The concentrations of PCBs
adsorbed onto the pellets were one order of magnitude higher
around the major cities of Porto and Lisbon and were directly
related to industrial and urban discharges. In less-developed cities,
PCBs are most likely airborne from industrialised areas (Mizukawa
et al., 2013). Similarly, beaches in the Saronikos Gulf near Athens
had higher contamination levels (Karapanagioti et al., 2011) than
other beaches around the world (e.g., Ogata et al., 2009). Organic
compounds and metals accumulate on PE plastic pellets in the
coastal and marine environments (Ashton et al., 2010).

Microplastics and associated pollutants were investigated in the
South Atlantic Ocean (Ogata et al., 2009). On South African beaches,
long-term surveys of PE pellets indicated that the mean average
concentrations of all of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
decreased from the 1980s to 2000s (Ryan et al., 2012). The con-
centrations of these contaminants likely decreased in the South
African coastal waters as well. In the western Atlantic Ocean, plastic
pellets were systematically sampled as deep as 1 m in the sediment
of a sandy beach at Santos Bay, which is a long-term and densely
industrialised region (Fisner et al., 2013). Higher concentrations of
P

-total PAHs were found in the surface layer (0e10 cm), whereas
P

-priority PAHs were found in higher concentrations in the 60e
70 cm layer. Petrogenic and pyrolytic sources were introduced to
the area (Fisner et al., 2013).

Laboratory experiments tested the kinetic distribution of plastic
pellets from different materials (PP, PE, polyoxymethylene (POM)
and eroded pellets) (Karapanagioti and Klontza, 2008). Phenan-
threne adsorption occurs through diffusion onto the plastic pellets
for all materials, except for PP. For this material, diffusion is most
likely dependent on salinity (more so than for the other materials).
For eroded pellets, the distribution coefficient (KdFW ¼ 1400 L kg?1)
is higher due to the weathering in the environment, and diffusion
occurs more slowly (Karapanagioti and Klontza, 2008).

Near the NPCG and California coast, the presence of PCBs, PAHs
from combusted fossil fuels, and DDTs from pesticides was reported
in plastic pellets and microplastic fragments (80e90% PP) (Rios
et al., 2007). Recently, plankton samples from the same area indi-
cated that PP fragments were still contaminated by organic pol-
lutants. Several samples exhibited high concentration levels
(similar to those from marine sediments), which demonstrates that
plastics actually adsorb and accumulate pollutants once in the
marine environment (Rios et al., 2010).

Using a thermodynamic approach, Gouin et al. (2011) suggested
that hydrophobic organic chemicals will adsorb onto PE plastics if
the plastics are available in large quantities and the natural organic
matter is limited. In addition, the transport of microplastics may
enhance the mobility of the hydrophobic compounds that have
limited transport potential (Gouin et al., 2011).

To assess the relationships between mass-produced plastic
polymers and organic contaminants, Rochman et al. (2013) carried
out a controlled experiment that exposed PE, PP, PET and PVC
fragments over a 12-month period to environmental concentra-
tions of PCBs and PAHs at San Diego Bay, California, where POPs
were already known to contaminate beached plastic debris (Van
et al., 2012). The concentrations of PAHs and PCBs that adsorbed
onto HDPE, LDPE, and PP were consistently greater than those
adsorbed onto PET and PVC fragments (Rochman et al., 2013). The
authors suggested that products made from HDPE, LDPE, and PP
pose a greater risk to marine animals than those products made
from PET and PVC if the fragments are ingested.

The possible differences amongst the most often used and
released types of plastics (i.e., PE, PP, PVC) have been tested in
sedimentary habitats. PE, which has larger volumes of the internal
cavities, adsorbed more phenanthrene than PP and PVC (Teuten
et al., 2007). Again, the authors suggested that microplastics
would increase the accumulation of PAHs when ingested by lug-
worms (A. marina). However, in the environment, chemical com-
pounds normally occur as mixtures, not single solute systems
(Bakir et al., 2012). In the laboratory, in a bi-solute system with
phenanthrene and 4,40-DDT, the DDT did not exhibit significantly
different sorption behaviour (using PE and PVC 200e250 mm) than
single solute systems. However, the DDT did appear to interfere
with the sorption of phenanthrene onto plastics, which indicates an
antagonistic effect (Bakir et al., 2012) (Table S5).

3. Discussion

It is well-established that plastics will fragment in the marine
environment and form micro and nano pieces (Andrady, 2011);
however, no long-term studies have been undertaken to estimate
the actual residence time of these fragments (Roy et al., 2011;
Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Moreover, if these fragments are not
completely mineralised (i.e., biodegraded) within relatively short
periods of time, their potential harmful effects must be addressed
(Figs. 1 and 2) (Roy et al., 2011). Scientific evidence of the fate and
consequences of microplastics rapidly emerged in the literature,
although crucial investigations remain uncompleted or overlooked
(Fig. 3).

Microplastics have a larger surface area to volume ratio than
macroplastics and are more susceptible to contamination by a
number of airborne pollutants (i.e., manufactured POPs and to
some extent, metals) (Table S5). Because plastics are made of highly
hydrophobic materials, the chemical pollutants are concentrated in
and/or onto their surfaces, and microplastics act as reservoirs of
toxic chemicals in the environment. Plastic pellets have been suc-
cessfully studied to assess the worldwide quantities of POPs in a
platform called the “International Pellet Watch” (e.g., Ogata et al.,
2009). With these data, it was possible to identify geographical
‘hotspots’ (Table S5). More importantly, scientists can continuously
and systematically monitor contaminated pellets and determine
the temporal patterns of various pollutants, which effectively aids
decision-makers (Fig. 3). Recently, laboratory studies showed that
weathering significantly changes the superficial characteristics of
virgin plastic pellets. Additionally, coloured plastics and different
types of polymers (i.e., PP and PE) may adsorb POPs from the

environment differently. These findings must be considered and
validated in future work and monitoring projects (e.g., Frias et al.,
2010), including in the assessment of microplastic fragments
(Hirai et al., 2011).

Microplastics transport pollutants over large oceanic areas (Zarfl
and Matthies, 2010) and contaminate the marine biota when
ingested (Teuten et al., 2007, 2009; Tanaka et al., 2013). By eating
the contaminated microplastics, individuals are susceptible to
physical damage and to doses of pollutants that were not previ-
ously accessible in other tangible matrices, such as seawater and
sediments. Organisms at every level of the marine food web ingest
microplastics (Fig. 2), but those inhabiting industrialised areas are
exposed to higher amounts and may be more contaminated.
However, the speculated quantities (mg g?1; ng g?1) of contami-
nants vary significantly among fragments within the same area;
consequently, the toxicity of pollutants and incorporation into
bodily tissues varies for each biological species. Some groups (e.g.,
holothurians) apparently ingest microplastics with specific colours
and shapes; if those polymers adsorb higher quantities of pollut-
ants, the consequences are most likely greater. Therefore, popula-
tion level effects, including the mechanisms to explain the
transference of ingested plastics and their adsorbed contaminants
along marine food webs, are merely speculative. Primary producers
are known to incorporate microplastics and organic pollutants
(Oliveira et al., 2012); therefore, bioaccumulation to top predators,
including larger species (Mysticetidae) (Fossi et al., 2012), or among
primary and secondary consumers may occur (Eriksson and Burton,
2003; Farrell and Nelson, 2012) (Fig. 2).

Potentially, microplastics with low and high densities are
ingested when present in the marine environment (Fig. 2) and tend
to float on the sea surface. There, they are available to a wide range
of organisms that may ingest microplastics passively or actively.
Until recently, only hypotheses and weak evidence for the ingestion
process were available (e.g., Day et al., 1984; Boerger et al., 2010;
Ramos et al., 2012). If the polymer is denser than the seawater or
becomes covered by biological films, then it tends to sink (even-
tually reaching the seabed) or becomes neutrally buoyant (e.g.,
Lattin et al., 2004).

Higher amounts of buoyant microplastics were reported in the
North Pacific Ocean, particularly the NPCG, than in other ocean
basins (Fig. 1). This region is currently referred to as the “eastern
garbage path” (Moore et al., 2001, 2002; Lattin et al., 2004; Rios
et al., 2010). Microplastics were mainly related to fishing activ-
ities (oceanic sources) in the gyre, but on the coast, they were
related to continental discharges at highly industrialised low lati-
tudes. In the North Atlantic Ocean, contamination patterns at the
sea surface are generally two orders of magnitude lower than in the
NPCG (Fig. 1). Fibres were prevalent in the North Sea, whereas hard
plastic fragments were more common in the Caribbean Sea; how-
ever, the sampling methods varied between the locations
(Table S1). The corresponding subtropical gyres in the Southern
Hemisphere were less contaminated, most likely because there are

seawater (i.e., PE and PP) and the red dots are polymers that are more dense than seawater (i.e., PVC). The dashed arrows represent the hypothesised microplastic transfer. (For

less land masses and the region is less developed than the highly
industrialised Northern Hemisphere. The 300 mm mesh size is most
commonly used to sample microplastics at sea (Hidalgo-Ruz et al.,
2012). However, additional mesh sizes were also applied, which
produce large variations in the quantity of microplastics collected
(e.g., Cole et al., 2011).
Fig. 3. Various issues regarding microplastic pollution at sea will need the cooperation of d
for coastal and marine environments, marine biota and society.
Surface-feeding petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses, including
fledgling chicks, appear to be the most impacted by floating
microplastics (up to 90% of samples). Scientific reports are wide-
spread, from the Antarctic to the Canadian Arctic, and throughout
all of the ocean basins (Fig. 1 and Table S3). As expected, ingested
amounts of plastics decreased towards the high latitudes; plastic

fragments are now prevalent over pellets as observed from the
long-term field work in the Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Morét-Ferguson
et al., 2010). Therefore, seabirds can be considered sensitive mon-
itors of small plastics at sea (Ryan, 2008). Ingested plastics signif-
icantly vary in size, and studies now need to quantify the
magnitude and characteristics of smaller sizes (&lt;1 mm) of micro-
plastics. Procellariiformes do not regurgitate plastics, which is one
explanation for the high amount of plastics observed in their
stomachs. However, POPs from the microplastics in their digestive
tracts can eventually enter the bloodstream, reach other organs and
possibly result in physiologic damage. Seabirds may eat pelagic
microplastics when feeding, but they likely also ingest planktivo-
rous fish and squids that had previously ingested microplastics
from seawater (similar to the observations of other top predators,
such as fur seals) (Table S3). Likewise, pelagic fish and squids may
ingest microplastics with plankton or ingest them actively (most of
the ingestion processes are largely speculative). The extent of the
problem is huge; fish (Myctophidae) reported in various geographic
regions with microplastics comprise more than half of the world
oceans’ total fish biomass. Furthermore, because fish excrete
ingested plastics (Hoss and Settle, 1990), sub-lethal effects are a
very likely hypothesis.

The shores on six continents are contaminated with micro-
plastics (Fig. 1). Fibres (mm) are prevalent in the eastern North
Atlantic and the North Sea due to continental effluent discharges.
Microplastic fragments and virgin plastic pellets are more common
when the size limitation of their detection is on the order of mil-
limetres (i.e., the eastern and western coasts of South America).
However, fibres are most likely also spread throughout these sed-
iments, mostly around urban areas (Browne et al., 2011). Oceanic
islands were also reportedly contaminated by microplastic frag-
ments. In estuaries, which are potential sources of these contami-
nants, studies are nearly non-existent. Moreover, the presence of
microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems and the soil are completely
absent from the literature (Rillig, 2012). The presence of micro-
plastics in coastal sediments resulted in unexpected consequences,
such as changes in the physical proprieties of beaches and associ-
ated problems (e.g., Carson et al., 2011).

Additionally, benthic species ingest microplastics in highly
developed areas and in small estuarine ecosystems (Fig. 1;
Table S3). Threads from fisheries (ropes and nets) were positively
identified in the digestive tracts of benthic fish and lobsters.
Microplastics, and consequently POPs, are possibly remobilised
(bioturbation) in the sedimentewater interface (Besseling et al.,
2013). Ingestion events were described for several groups of in-
vertebrates through laboratory experiments, but there is still a lack
of research on the ingestion of microplastics by invertebrates in the
marine environment, possibly because these studies are time-
consuming and require more advanced technology (Table S4).

4. Conclusion and suggestions

With knowledge comes greater responsibility. Historical and
recent findings regarding microplastic pollution in coastal and
marine environments, as described by review papers, need to be
coalesced to provide guidelines for all stakeholders concerned with
the life cycle of plastic. Two major issues are prevalent: how to
proceed with source control and methods to address the enormous
environmental passives that were built over the last 60 years (since
plastics became largely expendable) (Fig. 3). Source control has
been preached by every paper, official and un-official document on
marine plastics debris for decades. However, technical evidence
and published opinion have failed to effectively introduce it into
the DNA of the plastic production, use and re-use industries. Source
control has only been a priority for very close and restricted circles
where the 3Rs (or the 5Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink)
are the norm rather than the exception. Source control would have
to integrate and prioritise Rethink (choose other materials and
techniques) and Refuse (reduce the production of all single use
plastic items) into society and the production sectors. Specific ac-
tions targeted to primary and secondary sources of microplastics
are required to control pellets and to stop large items from reaching
the sea (where they decay). Unfortunately, based on present trends,
animals and humans will continue to be at risk and accidents will
occur before these goals are achieved.

Tackling the environmental passives is a different story. Micro-
plastics cannot be sieved from sands or filtered out of seawater.
Collecting all of these microparticles would take forever, and even
so it would not be effective. Microplastics will continue their slow,
intricate paths towards the bottom of the ocean and ultimately
become buried in sand and mud for centuries. However, rather than
despair, scientists should propose solutions that can be considered
by academia, society and industry. Each group of stakeholders
(academia, the community, decision-makers and industry) is
responsible for various tasks (Fig. 3) including communicating re-
sults to other stakeholders. Several knowledge gaps need to filled:
standardising size definitions; establishing the relative importance
of primary and secondary sources; rescuing information on pelagic
plastics that is stored in plankton samples; adding microplastics as
a routine survey variable in river basins and oceans; assessing
microplastic pollution in the Antarctic and Arctic; creating and
continuously improving experimental methods to quantify
microplastics.

Applied research, which is performed by many societal sectors,
has the potential to introduce new techniques to assess micro-
plastics pollution and new materials, designs and facilities that will
ultimately prevent plastics from reaching the environment. Some
suggestions include performing laboratory tests on microplastic
ingestion and necropsies for verification of physical harm, ingestion
of contaminated microplastics (POPs) and confirmation of trans-
ference/damage by histology and chemical characterisation of
pelagic and benthic microplastics to confirm its composition.

The community, although aware of the problem, must be guided
by the public sector to search for local alternatives to excessive
packaging, safely deposit their inevitable plastic rubbish and make
better and more informed choices as consumers. Additionally, in-
dependent world conferences on microplastics would coalesce
knowledge and actions, integrate research from countries where
primary plastics are produced/exported and help define the tem-
poral patterns of chemical pollutants (e.g., International Pellets
Watch).

These suggestions will require implementation of educational
programs, the cooperation of urban and rural facilities and, above
all, persuasion through practical examples of environments that
easily and directly exhibit proper control of waste. Decision-
makers, mostly in the public sector, have intelligent and techni-
cally sound regulations to issue in the future, in addition to existing
issues already enforced. State polices can be formed to direct the
control of the sources of primary plastics and calculate environ-
mental value losses (fish stocks, gas exchange, beach erosion) by
microplastic pollution. Additionally, a complete cradle-to-grave
approach to plastics would reduce the amount that reaches the
sea and reduce our carbon footprint. Plastics are a branch of the oil
and gas industry (8% of the oil produced is used in plastic pro-
duction). Therefore, both sectors must meet to collaborate as soon
as possible.

In addition to the petrochemical and plastics moulding units,
industry as a whole must be prepared for the need to produce and
use less plastic. Fiscal incentives for technologies that resolve
environmental passives need to be established. The intention is not



J.A. Ivar do Sul, M.F. Costa / Environmental Pollution 185 (2014) 352e364362
to face this sector as an arch-enemy, but rather to start a collabo-
rative process that will steadily progress from controlling pellet
pollution to effectively and dutifully applying reverse logistics to
tackle the environmental passives caused by plastics on land and at
sea.

The outcomes of such rationales are expected to be far-reaching.
First, coastal and marine habitats will regain their lost aesthetic
values, ecological functions and services. Secondly, the risks posed
to the marine biota will be reduced. Ultimately, these outcomes
would create a less plastic-addicted and more nature-centred so-
ciety in which the greatest values, based on science and experience,
are life and environmental preservation.

Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago
Plastic marine debris is presently widely recognised as an important environmental pollutant. Such deb-
ris is reported in every habitat of the oceans, from urban tourist beaches to remote islands and from the
ocean surface to submarine canyons, and is found buried and deposited on sandy and cobble beaches.
Plastic marine debris varies from micrometres to several metres in length and is potentially ingested
by animals of every level of the marine food web. Here, we show that synthetic polymers are present
in subsurface plankton samples around Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic
Ocean. To explain the distribution of microplastics around the Archipelago, we proposed a generalised
linear model (GLM) that suggests the existence of an outward gradient of mean plastic-particle densities.
Plastic items can be autochthonous or transported over large oceanic distances. One probable source is
the small but persistent fishing fleet using the area.

Plastics are a complex problem in the marine environment. The
quantities and consequences of macroplastics in the oceans and
coastal habitats have been well documented in the literature for
at least four decades (e.g., Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2007; Moore,
2008; Barnes et al., 2009). Presently, the scientific community is fo-
cused on microplastics (defined as plastics with less than 5 mm), a
size fraction much more abundant (Law et al., 2010; Browne et al.,
2011; Andrady, 2011) and probably most hazardous to marine
organisms (Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Thompson et al., 2004).
The ingestion of microplastics has been documented for verte-
brates (Moore, 2008; Boerger et al., 2010) and invertebrates
(Wright et al., 2013) from every level of the marine food web
and is very likely to be related to the plastics’ size, shape and col-
our, although additional studies are needed to clarify these ques-
tions. Expected consequences of an ingestion event are physical
injuries and blockage, but microplastics are alsoefficient in the
transport of sorbed organic and inorganic pollutants, which can
contaminate animal tissues (Teuten et al., 2009; Tanaka et al.,
2013).

The first attempt to quantify floating plastic debris was made in
the Western North Atlantic Ocean (Carpenter and Smith, 1972;
Law et al., 2010) nearly 40 years ago, but studies have also been re-
ported for the North Pacific Ocean (e.g., Moore et al., 2001) since
the turn of the XXIst century. Recently, other oceans were reported
to also be contaminated by microplastics (e.g., Collignon et al.,
2012). Therefore, the problem seems to be widespread throughout
the ocean basins. However, the appropriate sampling procedures
are difficult, especially in remote areas, and many years of studies
will be needed to characterise the magnitude of microplastic pollu-
tion. Experts have suggested that floating plastics from archived
plankton samples should be used to further improve our present
knowledge (Arthur et al., 2009), revealing information on micro-
plastic amounts and spatial distributions. This sample re-purpos-
ing has been already done successfully in large-scale studies (i.e.,
Thompson et al., 2004; Law et al., 2010; More?t-Ferguson et al.,
2010). Following this international trend but focused on a small-
scale perspective, we examined existing plankton samples from
the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (0?550N, 29?200W), a re-
mote oceanic seamount that rises only a few metres above sea le-
vel on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Fig. 1A).

Our initial hypothesis is that, despite its geographic isolation,
this archipelago is not free from pelagic microplastic pollution.
Searching for microplastics in this remote environment is very dif-
ferent from conducting plankton tows in the centres of subtropical
gyres, where large, positively buoyant plastics are known to accu-
mulate, mainly due to surface currents and winds (Moore et al.,
2001; Moore, 2008; More?t-Ferguson et al., 2010; Maximenko
et al., 2012). In this equatorial region, the mechanisms that drive
the local distribution of microplastics around the Saint Peter and
Saint Paul Archipelago are not known but are probably more influ-
enced by smaller-scale phenomena (particle aggregation or animal
activities) (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012) than by variables acting over
whole oceanic basins. In the Archipelago, the prevailing wind-
driven current is the northern branch of the oligotrophic South
Equatorial Current (SEC), which flows westward (Lumpkin and

Garzoli, 2005). In addition, the Equatorial Undercurrent (EU) is a
shallow current (40–150 m depth) derived from the North Brazil
Current, which flows eastward, eventually reaching the sea surface
(Stramma and Schott, 1999). Both of these currents are parallel to
the Equator (Stramma and Schott, 1999; Lumpkin and Garzoli,
2005).

Around oceanic islands and seamounts, horizontal interactions
between biological and physical mechanisms aggregate and con-
centrate plankton (at small scales), frequently enhancing biological
production (Genin, 2004). In this context, initial research around-
the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago intended to test varia-
tions of zooplankton biomass, abundance and diversity.
Subsurface (0–0.6 m from the surface) plankton tows (5–10 min
at 2 knots) were conducted at three distances from the Archipelago
(&lt;100 m, 100–500 m and 500–1500 m) in April, August and
November 2003 and in March 2004. Samples were collected with
a conical–cylindrical plankton net (0.6 m mouth diameter), with
300 lm mesh size and 2 m length, equipped with a flowmeter.
The samples were fixed (4% formalin) before storage.

For plastic surveys, these archived plankton samples were fil-
tered through a 0.45 lm filter and freeze-dried. The dried material
was weighed and observed under a stereomicroscope (5?). Plastic
items were separated and classified regarding their appearance,
shape, size and colour.

The dry material present in the samples was composed almost
exclusively of zooplankton. From the 88 horizontal subsurface
tows, 41% contained at least one, and a maximum of eight, micro-
plastics. A total of 71 individual items were recognised and were
classified according to their shape as hard fragments, threads and
rubber crumbs (Figs. 1B and 2). The total mean density was
approximately 1 item per 100 m3 of seawater. All the microplastics
derived from the breakdown of larger objects (Barnes et al., 2009;
Ivar do Sul et al., 2009), i.e., were secondary-sourced plastics
(Arthur et al., 2009; Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). The particle sizes
varied from ?1 mm to &gt;5 mm (Fig. 1C), and the predominant col-
ours were white/transparent, black and a third group of coloured
items (Fig. 1D). The 300 lm mesh size is the most commonly used
mesh for microplastics sampling (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012) and was
successfully applied to sample microplastics.

Surprisingly, we did not find any plastic resin pellets, commonly
present in oceanic plankton samples (Moore et al., 2001; Law et al.,
2010) and on beaches of oceanic islands, such as the Fernando de
Noronha Archipelago (3?S, 32?W) (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). There,
the occurrence of plastic pellets was restricted to windward bea-
ches, constantly exposed to the northern branch of the SEC, which
is also the prevalent large-scale wind-driven current observed in
the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago. Therefore, local sources
of items might be prevalent over long-range oceanic transport of
plastics near round the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.

At the Archipelago, all the identified microplastics have second-
ary sources. The pieces were weathered fragments of larger plastic
items, most likely polypropylene and polyethylene, which repre-
sent the majority of the plastic polymers produced (and conse-
quently discarded) worldwide (Andrady, 2011). In equatorial
oceans, where the sunlight radiation is intense, constant through-
out the year and shines 12 h day?1, plastics are exposed to extreme

degradation conditions because light-induced oxidation is
undoubtedly the main factor responsible for the fragmentation of
plastics in the marine environment (Andrady, 2011).

The observed threads (Fig. 2a–c) are possibly related to fishery
activities near the Archipelago (Vaske et al., 2005; Luiz and Ed-
wards, 2011). Fisheries are a recognised source of microplastics
to the marine environment (Moore, 2008; Andrady, 2011), and
their secondary-sourced fragments were previously identified in
plankton tows elsewhere (i.e., Moore et al., 2001; Collignon et al.,
2012; Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). To illustrate the magnitude of this
activity in the Archipelago, commercial fishing has been named
responsible for the extinction of shark populations (Luiz and Ed-
wards, 2011). Therefore, we considered that at least part of these
fragments had autochthonous sources. However, as previously
noted by other researchers, it is much more difficult to determine
even the most probable source of hard plastic fragments (e.g.,
Barnes et al., 2009; Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).

Once the presence of microplastic fragments in the Archipelago
was confirmed, we asked if there was any particular behaviour (in
this case, the occurrence of microplastics) related to the distance
(&lt;1500 km) from this seamount, as observed for other living and
non-living particles around the Archipelago (Macedo-Soares
et al., 2012; Brandão et al., 2013). To explain the distribution of
microplastics around the Archipelago, a generalised linear model
(GLM) was developed.

Environmental variables that were considered relevant (and
that were available for the area) for explaining the distribution of
pelagic plastics around the Archipelago were assessed. These vari-
ables were the monthly total precipitation, water temperature and
salinity, wind velocity and direction and chlorophyll a level. Water
temperature and salinity were measured in situ concomitantly
with plankton tows. Chlorophyll a values were obtained from the
literature (Macedo-Soares et al., 2012), and wind velocity, wind
direction and precipitation were obtained from the nearest oceanic
mooring (0?, 35?W) (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/). We iden-
tified two main seasons at the Archipelago (Table 1), characterised
by high (300 mm) and low (25 mm) total monthly precipitation
(Macedo-Soares et al., 2012). Other environmental variables also
varied seasonally (Table 1).

Selected environmental variables were used as covariates in the
GLM together with the zooplankton biomass and the sampling dis-
tances from the Archipelago. Zooplankton biomass (dry weight)
ranged from 0.34 to 20.81 g m?3 during both the rainy and dry
seasons.

The initial dataset with 630 lines, corresponding to the detailed
microplastic characteristics of the 88plankton tows, was altered
by adding values in different lines to form a new dataset with fewer
zeros, which allowed the use of more consistent statistical methods.
First, lines were merged for the rainy and dry seasons separately. Be-
cause the number of zeros was still excessive, we merged the lines
in the matrix considering the main colour of microplastics (white,
black and coloured) (Fig. 1D). The procedure was then repeated,
considering microplastic size classes (&lt;1 mm, 1.1–5 mm, &gt;5 mm)
and shapes (Fig. 1C and B, respectively). The final dataset had 18
lines representing the two sampling seasons (rainy and dry) and
three distances (&lt;100 m, 100–500 m and 500–1500 m) from the
Archipelago. This sum resulted in a new variable, the Total Mean
Density of microplastics(TMD microplastics m?3).

Then, we started developing the GLM with eight environmental
covariates (i.e., monthly total precipitation, water temperature and
salinity, zooplankton biomass, sampling distances from the Archi-

pelago, wind velocity and direction, and chlorophyll a) (forming
the saturated model). We used an Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA), a stepwise process and the AIC criteria to select the most
adequate GLM until no further improvement was possible. Non-
significant variables were progressively eliminated until the final
model was obtained (Eq. (1)). Those variables with numerical val-
ues that remained fairly constant throughout the year (mainly be-
cause the Archipelago is in an equatorial oceanic region) or that
apparently did not influence the densities of plastic fragments
were left out of the model. Finally, the selected covariates included
in the GLM were those two that could significantly (p &amp;lt;0.1) explain
the TMD of microplastics around the Saint Peter and Saint Paul
Archipelago (Eq. (1)).

To validate the selected model, a residual analysis was also con-
ducted. The normal probability plot with envelopes (Fig. 3A) did
not show any unusual behaviour. Thus, the hypothesis of normal
distribution for the errors of the model can be used. The plot of
deviance-component residuals versus fitted values (Fig. 3B) also
presented a randomised behaviour. The GLM was built using R
software (R Development Core Team 2009).

Our final GLM has two (from initial 8) covariates, zooplankton-
biomass (Zoobiom) and sampling distances from the Archipelago
(Dist100, Dist500 and Dist1500), which were significant to explain
the behaviour of the TMD of microplastics (Yi) sampled around
the Archipelago:

Y i ¼ expfb0 þ b1 Dist500i þ b2 Dist1500i þ b3Zoobiomigþ ei i ¼ 1; . . . ; 18
ð1Þ

where i is the number of observations, ei ? N(0, r2), Dist500i = (1 if ith
100 &amp;lt;distance 6 500 m; 0 in other cases), and Dist1500i = (1 if i

th

500 &amp;lt;distance 6 1500 m; 0 in other cases).
The fitted curves are defined as follows:

dTMD ¼ expf?2:2097 ? 0:0499Zoobiomg if distance 6 100 m ð2Þ

dTMD ¼ expf?2:8185 ? 0:0499Zoobiomg if 100 &amp;lt;distance
6 500 m ð3Þ

dTMD ¼ expf?3:2393 ? 0:0499Zoobiomg if 500 &amp;lt;distance
6 1500 m ð4Þ

The residual deviance is 0.012 (14 df) with a p-value = 0.449 for the
goodness-of-fit test. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) =
?70.057 (br2 = 0.0008). The GLM indicates that the Total Mean Den-
sity ( dTMD) of microplastics decreases outward, while the zooplank-
ton biomass is constant (Fig. 1E and Eqs. (2)–(4)).

Oceanographic mechanisms around the Saint Peter and Saint
Paul Archipelago promote the topographic trapping of zooplankton
(Genin, 2004; Macedo-Soares et al., 2012; Brandão et al., 2013).
Therefore, microplastics may likewise aggregate and be retained
bysmall-scale circulation patterns. Reef fish (Macedo-Soares
et al., 2012) and semi-terrestrial decapod larvae (Brandão et al.,
2013) are more abundant at distances &amp;lt;100 m from the Archipel-
ago than further away. However, holopelagic decapods (Brandão
et al., 2013), which reproduce in pelagic environments, follow
the opposite trend. This pattern reinforces the results shown by
our model and our suggestion of the occurrence of autochthonous
sources. Microplastics might be retained close to the Archipelago,
as are reef fish larvae.

Moreover, microplastics are known to be ingested by planktiv-
orous fishes (Boerger et al., 2010), which are then preyed on by top
predators. A possible pathway along the trophic web in the Saint
Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago is suggested because the transfer
of microplastics along marine food webs is a demonstrated issue
(Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Farrell and Nelson, 2013). Cypselurus
cyanopterus is an example of a planktivorous fish preyed on by sea-
birds, such as Sula leucogaster, and large pelagic fishes, such as
Thunnus albacares (Vaske et al., 2005), which are important eco-
logic and economic taxa that might be exposed to microplastic pol-
lution. This exposure is a concern in the context of the
environment’s isolation and the risk of microplastics pollution at
the individual to community levels.

Abstract Recent evidence suggests that microplastic
pollution is widespread in every oceanic basin; however,
there is limited data available for the tropical South
Atlantic Ocean. The purpose of this study was to exam-
ine the distribution, density and characteristics of plastic
particles in plankton samples collected in the western
tropical Atlantic Ocean. Neustonic tows (N=160) were
conducted near three important insular environments
(Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade), and
the presence of microplastics in the ocean surface of
these areas was confirmed for the first time. The collect-
ed microplastic particles included hard plastic frag-
ments, plastic films, paint chips and fibres and strands,
which were classified as a secondary source of
microplastics. The stock of plastic originates from both
land-based and marine-based sources. This type of ma-
rine pollution in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is a potential
threat to important ecological species.

1 Introduction

The prediction that plastic marine debris would be one
of the most important pollutants in the twenty-first cen-
tury is now widely recognised. The fates and conse-
quences of macroplastics (&gt;5 mm) in oceanic and coast-
al environments and to the marine biota have been
documented over the last 40 years (Moore 2008;
Barnes et al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2009). However,
the fragmentation of macroplastics to mesoplastics and
microplastics remains poorly understood (Andrady
2011). Therefore, the current focus of the scientific
community is on one of the smallest fractions of plastic
pollution (i.e. microplastics&amp;lt;5 mm) (Barnes et al. 2009;
Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014).

Recently, research on microscopic plastic particles
has significantly increased worldwide (Cole et al.
2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Ivar do Sul and Costa
2014). Microplastics pose a substantial threat to marine
biota via ingestion because they are similar in size to
many organisms in the benthos and plankton communi-
ties. Therefore, microplastics are widely available to the
entire marine food web (Wright et al. 2013). Uptake
depends on the size, shape and density of the particles
(Browne et al. 2011). For vertebrates, the ingestion of
plastics was suggested to be related to the type and
colour of plastics prevalent in the marine environment
(Ryan 2008). Studies on invertebrates are predominant-
ly restricted to laboratory experiments (Wright et al.
2013), and the extent of the problem remains largely
speculative (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Moreover, the
organic and inorganic chemical compounds in seawater

may adsorb onto microplastic particles (Teuten et al.
2007) and potentially transport the pollutants over large
oceanic areas (Zarfl and Matthies 2010). If ingested,
contaminants may be released into gastrointestinal tracts
and eventually contaminate tissues and organs (Tanaka
et al. 2013).

Microplastics are directly released into the envi-
ronment (i.e. primary source microplastics)
(Thompson et al. 2009; Fendall and Sewell 2009)
and continually formed at sea through degradation
and subsequent fragmentation from larger plastic
items (i.e. secondary source fragments) (Andrady
2011). The relative importance of secondary and pri-
mary source microplastics in the open ocean has yet to
be established; however, recent evidence indicates
that fragments are mostly sampled (e.g. Ryan 2008;
Law et al. 2010). Polyethylene (PE) and polypropyl-
ene (PP) have a high probability of ending up in
marine environments (Andrady 2011) because they
are more widely produced (Table 1) and discarded.
These polymers are denser than seawater, which
makes them positively buoyant. Polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET) and rigid polystyrene (PS) are also
polymers that are widely used in the production of
throw-away plastics; however, they are not observed
on the sea surface because they sink.

The sea surface and beach sediments are environ-
mental matrices that are more widely studied in terms
of microplastic pollution (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012).
The literature, which covers many regions over vary-
ing time periods, confirms that microplastic pollution
is ubiquitous and frequently contaminates the sea
surface, especially in the Northern Hemisphere (Ivar
do Sul and Costa 2014). Pelagic plastics have been
reported in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, at
the centre of subtropical gyres (Moore et al. 2001;
Law et al. 2010) and along urbanised coastal areas
(Lattin et al. 2004; Doyle et al. 2011). Microplastics
have been sampled in the western Mediterranean Sea
(Collignon et al. 2012), the North Sea (Dubaish and
Liebezeit 2013) and the Laurentian Great Lakes
(Eriksen et al. 2013a).

In the equatorial region, microplastics have been
sampled around a remote archipelago in the Atlantic
Ocean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). However, data on the
presence and characteristics of microplastic pollution in
the Southern Hemisphere is significantly more limited.
Surface tows have confirmed the presence of
microplastics in the South Pacific subtropical gyre. They

occurred in smaller densities but within the same range
of magnitude as the density of microplastics in the North
Pacific (Eriksen et al. 2013b). In the Atlantic Ocean,
Ryan (1988) reported the presence of pelagic plastics
around the African continent, whereas Barnes et al.
(2009) confirmed their occurrence in the Southern
Ocean.

Because no systematic study has been developed for
the western tropical Atlantic, this study aimed to con-
firm the presence of floating microplastic particles in
that region for the first time. Sampling was conducted
around three insular environments (i.e. Fernando de
Noronha Archipelago, Abrolhos Archipelago and
Trindade Island) located within the ‘Blue Amazon’, a
domain of approximately 4.5 million km2 that includes
the continental shelf and the Brazilian Exclusive Eco-
nomic Zone (EEZ). The oligotrophic South Equatorial
Current (SEC) is the major southern pathway by which
water is transported into the tropical Atlantic (Stramma
and Schott 1999). The central and southern branches of
the SEC and the Brazilian Current are the main superfi-
cial currents that reach the studied islands (Lumpkin and
Garzoli 2005) (Fig. 1a). The local circulation patterns
remain unknown.

The mountain peaks of a volcanic cordillera along the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge form the Fernando de Noronha
Archipelago (Fig. 1a). The main island has an area of
17 km2 and is the only inhabited island with a popula-
tion of 3,000 residents. An additional 80,000 tourists
visit the archipelago annually. The average air tempera-
ture is approximately 25 °C, and constant winds have a
predominant SE direction (Fig. 1b). The Abrolhos Ar-
chipelago is on an enlargement of the Brazilian conti-
nental shelf (Fig. 1a). This archipelago is formed by five
small (100–1,000 m in length) islands (i.e. Santa
Bárbara, Redonda, Siriba, Sueste and Guarita) arranged
in a semicircle (Fig. 1c). Only one island is inhabited
(&lt;10 people); however, 4,000 tourists visit the archipel-
ago annually. The average air temperature is approxi-
mately 27 °C, and constant winds have predominantly
SE/E direction (Fig. 1c). The volcanic islands of
Trindade (8 km2) and Martin Vaz in the Trindade-
Vitória seamount chain are 5,600 m above the ocean
floor and 600 m above sea level (Fig. 1a). The average
air temperature is approximately 24 °C, and constant
winds have a predominant NE/E direction (Fig. 1d).
Unlike the other studied islands, Trindade is a military
base where activities are restricted and tourism is
prohibited.

After microplastics in the western tropical Atlantic
were detected, we determined the density, type, size and
colour of the microplastics, which objectively reflects
the contamination patterns of the entire western Atlan-
tic. Finally, the contamination patterns of Fernando de
Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade were compared.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Survey Methods

One hundred and sixty neustonic plankton tows were
conducted around the islands of Fernando de Noronha,
Abrolhos and Trindade using an inflatable boat. Sam-
ples were collected in the austral summers of 2011/2012
and 2012/2013 using a manta trawl net (3.5 m in length
with a 300-?m mesh size) that was equipped with a
flowmeter (Moore et al. 2001). The size of the rectan-
gular net opening was 0.9×0.15 m2. Each sample was
obtained at an average speed of 1.5 knots for 15 min.
The tows were conducted at the windward and leeward
side of each island according to the prevailing winds
(Fig. 1b, c, d). Samples (500 ml) were fixed in 4 %
formalin before storage. In the laboratory, samples were
filtered and freeze-dried. The dried material was

weighed (0.01 g) and observed under a stereomicro-
scope (5X) (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).

The microplastics were separated and classified accord-
ing to their appearance/shape, size and colour. The follow-
ing five categories were defined: hard plastic fragments,
plastic films, paint chips, fibres and strands (Fig. 2 a-e).
Plastic resin pellets were only detected in small amounts
(n=4, 1.6 % of the total) and not treated as a separate
category in this study. When detected, they were classified
as hard plastic fragments because of their visual appear-
ance and hardness. Polystyrene foam was not observed in
these samples. For fragments, films and paint chips, each
item was individually sorted, counted and measured (lon-
gest axis—mm). The volume (m3) of each individual tow
was obtained with a flowmeter and used to calculate the
density of microplastic particles, which was expressed as
particles per cubic metre of seawater.

In this study, fibres and strands were treated sepa-
rately. By visual identification, the strands were ob-
served to be significantly thinner than the fibres
(Fig. 2d, e). Although the fibres and strands have been
sorted, they have not been separated and individually
measured because high amounts were detected in the
contaminated samples. However, we combined all of
the fibres and strands from each sample in a Petri dish
that used millimetre paper with 3×3 mm2 squares as a
reference. Then, we measured the area (mm2) of the

which resulted in a unit (density) expressed in square

2.2 Statistical Analysis

Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
determine the differences between several microplastic

variables (total number of particles, total area (mm2) of
fibres/strands, particles m?3, area m?3) amongst the
studied islands, leeward and windward sides of each
island, categories of sampled items and colours (i.e.
white/transparent versus coloured microplastic). The
data were transformed (Box and Cox 1964) to increase
the normality of the distribution. An a posteriori Fisher’s
LSD test was used to determine significantly different
means at a probability level of 0.05 when the results
from the ANOVA showed a significant difference.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 General Contamination Patterns

More than 16,000 m3 of seawater was filtered during the
samplings. Plankton samples weighed 144.7 g (total dry
weight) and included marine algae, zooplankton,
ichthyoplankton and other materials (e.g. terrestrial leaves
and feathers). Two outliers were identified for Fernando de
Noronha and Abrolhos, which represented 56 and 40 % of
the dry weight, respectively. From the 160 net tows, 68 %
contained microplastics from the five predefined categories
(Fig. 2). Proportionally, Trindade was the most contami-
nated with ?90 % (n=64) of all samples containing
microplastic debris. Approximately half of the samples
collected from Abrolhos (n=48) and Fernando de Noronha
(n=48) contained microplastic debris.

Therefore, the presence of pelagic microplastics in
the western tropical Atlantic Ocean was confirmed.
Surface tows have been successfully applied to sample
microplastics in the open ocean (Hidalgo-Ruz et al.
2012) using small-scale ~1.5 km (Ivar do Sul et al.
2013) and large-scale ~4 × 103 km (Law et al. 2010)
surveys. Several microplastic categories sampled in this
study (i.e. hard plastic fragments, plastic films and paint
chips) (Fig. 2) are comparable to others that have been
collected elsewhere (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Doyle

et al. 2011; Eriksen et al. 2013a), including in the
equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).
Amongst them, hard plastic fragments commonly rep-
resent the majority of plastic items detected in plankton
samples (Moore et al. 2001). Indeed, few primary source
plastics (i.e. resin plastic pellets) were sampled in this
study. However, they were commonly collected with
other floating microplastic particles (e.g. Morét-
Ferguson et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013b), such as in
the net tows conducted in the South Atlantic Ocean in
the early 1980s (Morris 1980). Moreover, in the western
Atlantic, the occurrence of plastic pellets on windward
beaches in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago has
been previously reported (Ivar do Sul et al. 2009). After
studying the gastrointestinal tracts of seabirds that
ingested plastics in a marine environment, Ryan
(2008) also reported the dominance of plastic fragments.
The proportion of plastic pellets significantly decreased
from 1980 to the 2000s, but because the total load of
ingested plastics did not significantly vary between de-
cades, the author attributed this change to the increase in
secondary source plastics in the environment (Ryan
2008).

These evidences suggest that the highest proportion
of total floating particles is plastic fragments, whereas
the smallest proportion is pellets (Morét-Ferguson et al.
2010; Doyle et al. 2011; Eriksen et al. 2013b). During

the last 30–40 years, an increase in the use of single-use,
throw-away products, which are eventually lost to the
ocean, has been observed. Additionally, there has been
an increase in the number of routes and fleets in the sea
and the use of synthetic nets in the fishing industry.
Plastic debris degrades slowly in marine environments.
The fragmentation processes of various polymers re-
main speculative and restricted to controlled laboratory
experiments. Therefore, over the last few decades, frag-
ments have been continually formed at sea and
transported from coastal areas to the open ocean, where
they accumulate. If this is confirmed, the number of
secondary source plastics in open oceans will continu-
ally increase until the fragmentation process stabilises.

Fibres and strands have not been frequently reported
in plankton tows and remain associated with sedimen-
tary environments (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Nu-
merous previous works have used archived samples to
study microplastic debris on the sea surface (e.g. Law
et al. 2010; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010). Fibres may be
lost when chemical substances (e.g. formaldehyde) are
used to preserve the plankton samples. Indeed, because
plastic fragments are prevalent and relatively easy to
distinguish, fibres can be misidentified during laborato-
ry work unless they occur in significant amounts, which
is when the fibres can be differentiated as synthetic
materials. Analytical techniques are still required to
conclusively identify the type of polymer (Browne
et al. 2011). Finally, the presence of fibres and strands
in this study was detected in higher amounts compared
with previous studies in the literature.

3.2 Fragments and Paint Chips

A total of 243 plastic particles were sampled (Table 2,
Fig. 2a, b, c), and the mean contamination was determined
to be 1.52 particles per tow. Hard plastic fragments (78 %)
(Fig. 2a) were significantly more sampled (ANOVA, p=
0.000) than plastic films and paint chips. The majority
(75 %) were 5 mm or smaller. Plastic films (9 % of the
total) were also&amp;lt;5 mm in size (70 %) (Table 2). In the
Atlantic Ocean, most (70–90 %) of the sampled particles
were smaller than 10 mm and usually&amp;lt;5 mm (Law et al.
2010; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).
Because of their size, they are available to any level of the
marine food web (Wright et al. 2013), from primary pro-
ducers to large top predators (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014).
Few studies have reported on the prevalence of specific
colours (e.g. Shaw and Day 1994); therefore, ingestion is

more likely related to the availability of particles in the
marine environment than to any colour-based selectivity
amongst vertebrates (Boerger et al. 2010). However, addi-
tional studies are required. In this study, white and trans-
parent plastic particles were more prevalent, but not sig-
nificantly, than coloured particles (Table 3) (ANOVA,
p&gt;0.05). This pattern was previously observed in the
North Pacific Ocean (Shaw and Day 1994). The colour
distribution of the floating plastics may be an indicator of
the residence time of the plastic on the sea surface and may
reveal any ingestion preferences by the marine biota.
Therefore, the effect of microplastic colour has to be
addressed in future studies.

Paint chips represented 12 % of the sampled plastic
particles for the islands studied (Table 2, Fig. 2c). They
are usually generated in boatyards, shipyards and at sea
during the repair, maintenance and cleaning of vessel
hulls. In the marine environment, they measure several
centimetres to a few micrometres in length (Turner
2010). Moreover, evidence suggests that they can also
fragment in the marine environment through erosion, a
largely unstudied process. However, it is expected that
antifouling substances used in paint formulations are
released during this process (Singh and Turner 2009;
Turner 2010), which is potentially threatening to the
environment and its biota. Their distribution in the sea
surface has not yet been systematically addressed
(Turner 2010); however, a few studies have conclusive-
ly identified these particles in neuston samples (Morét-
Ferguson et al. 2010; Eriksen et al. 2013a). There is a
small port in Fernando de Noronha that maintains and
services traditional boats; therefore, the presence of
paint chips is expected. There is no port on Trindade;
however, it is along the route of many boats and ships,
which may remain in the area for extended periods (i.e.
longline fishing vessels) (Pinheiro et al. 2010).

In the western tropical Atlantic, the mean concentra-
tion of plastic particles in the neuston was 0.03 particles
per cubic metre of seawater (Table 4). Around the São
Pedro e São Paulo Archipelago (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013),
in the Southeast Bering Sea and along the southern
California coast (Doyle et al. 2011), the densities of
microplastics were on the same order of magnitude as
those sampled in this study. The highest density of a
single tow (0.13 particles m?3) around the island of
Trindade was comparable to coastal regions near highly
urbanised areas (i.e. Los Angeles, CA) (Doyle et al.
2011) and values reported for other oceanic basins
(Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014; Table 4).

3.2.1 Comparisons of the Studied Areas

Considering the total number of sampled particles
(Table 2), Trindade was significantly more contam-
inated than Abrolhos and Fernando de Noronha
(ANOVA, p=0.000). If only hard plastic fragments
and plastic films were considered, both Trindade

and Abrolhos were significantly more contaminat-
ed (ANOVA, p=0.000) by microplastic particles
than Fernando de Noronha. Similarly, considering
the density of microplastic debris (particles m?3),
Trindade and Abrolhos were significantly more
contaminated than Fernando de Noronha (ANOVA,
p=0.005). The majority of items were hard plastic

fragments and films (ANOVA, p=0.010). Howev-
er, there were no significant differences between
the leeward and windward sides of each island in
terms of microplastic pollution.

The Fernando de Noronha Archipelago is currently
less contaminated by microplastic particles than other
insular environments located in the western tropical
Atlantic. The source of the floating particles that were
sampled was probably not directly correlated to the
garbage generated on the studied islands (i.e. autochtho-
nous sources). An extremely different scenario was
observed for Fernando de Noronha because it has a
higher population density and receives thousands of
tourists each year compared to the other islands. There-
fore, the microplastics floating around Fernando de
Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade are being transported
by prevailing currents and winds on the sea surface until
they accumulate in the open ocean. It is difficult to
discern whether these degraded fragments are being
transported over long distances from land-based sources
or if they are plastic items that were illegally dumped at
sea (i.e. marine-based sources). Plastic fragments do not
retain information regarding their origin or most proba-
ble source (Barnes et al. 2009; Doyle et al. 2011; Ivar do
Sul et al. 2009). In Abrolhos, for instance, significant
sedimentation rates (0.1–0.8 cm year-1) from large
hydrographical basins (i.e. Doce and Jequitinhonha)
are able to reach the inner shelf around the archipelago
(Knoppers et al. 1999), which is only 70 km from the
shore. Therefore, continental discharges may contribute
to the amount of plastic sampled, as was observed along
highly populated coasts in the Northern Hemisphere
(Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014).

A general trend of increasing density (particles m-3)
with decreasing particles size was not observed in this
study (Fig. 3). This pattern was previously reported in
the North Pacific gyre (Moore et al. 2001) and along the
California coast (Doyle et al. 2011), where it was sug-
gested to be related to the long-time permanence of
secondary source plastic particles in the marine environ-
ment (Andrady 2011). In the western tropical Atlantic,
the absence of such a pattern may indicate that plastics
are continuously being released into the gyre faster than
plastics are being fragmented in the ocean.

3.3 Fibres and Strands

A total area of 1,177 mm2 of microplastics in the
form of fibres and strands were sampled. One item
represented 75 % of this area (Fig. 2f). This item
may indicate that larger nets and ropes are
fragmenting into smaller fibres and strands in ma-
rine environments. The fragmentation process may
be more significant in tropical areas because the
plastics are exposed to extreme degradation condi-
tions (Andrady 2011; Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). The
horizontal interactions between biological and
physical mechanisms aggregate and concentrate
plankton (Genin 2004), and most likely plastics
(Ivar do Sul et al. 2013), near oceanic islands.
Thus, fibres and strands were retained and sampled

around the islands of Trindade, Fernando de
Noronha and Abrolhos. For comparison, when the
outlier is excluded (Table 5), this area (fibres plus
strands) represents one third of the total area occu-
pied by hard plastic fragments, plastic films and
paint ships (&gt;900 mm2) in the same sample. If the
hard plastic fragments were sorted on a Petri dish
as fibres, they would occupy a larger surface area
than the fibres and would be considered to be
comparatively prevalent. In this way, the plankton
tows sampled in this study were also more contam-
inated with plastic fragments as well as others that
have been reported elsewhere (Barnes et al. 2009;
Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Ivar do Sul and Costa
2014). The mean contamination was 1.88 mm2 of
fibres and strands per tow for all of the islands.

By visual identification, fibres (Fig. 2d) resemble
fragments of fishing lines and have commonly been
sampled in other surface plankton tows (e.g. Moore
et al. 2001; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010), including in
the equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013).
Larger fishing lines are already widely recognised as a
threat to marine biota, including large vertebrates and

invertebrates (i.e. coral reefs, lobsters) because of the
risk of entanglement (Moore 2008). It is possible that
small fragments form fibres in the marine environment
could potentially be ingested.

Strands are easily identified as synthetic polymers.
Using a stereomicroscope, they are distinguished from
natural particulates because of their bright and diverse
colours (i.e. blue, red, green), which do not resemble
marine animal and plant tissue (Browne et al. 2011).
Strands have previously been reported in neuston sam-
ples that used meshes with smaller apertures in the
sampling procedure (Thompson et al. 2004; Dubaish
and Liebezeit 2013). In the North Sea, strands were
correlated with the discharge of a local sewage treatment
plant and most likely originated from the abrasion of
synthetic textiles (i.e. polyester and polyacrylate) in
washing machines (Dubaish and Liebezeit 2013).
Browne et al. (2011) first observed the contamination
of wastewaters by microplastic strands when studying
the deposition of plastic on sediments around urbanised
areas.

However, the presence of strands in the open ocean
can also be related to fishing. It is possible that ropes and

nets (mainly PP) fragment in the marine environment
and form strands (Thompson et al. 2004; Murray and
Cowie 2011). This is a relevant source of plastics for
islands located far from continental shores; however, no
conclusive origins have been determined. In the Clyde
Sea, lobsters (Nephrops) ingested microplastic strands
that had fragmented from fishing ropes (Murray and
Cowie 2011). Such plastics are particularly hazardous
because they may clump and knot, which may prevent
egestion (Murray and Cowie 2011; Cole et al. 2011).
This type of microplastic debris was also reported in the
gastrointestinal tracts of mesopelagic and
benthophagous fish in oceanic (Davison and Asch
2011) and estuarine (Possatto et al. 2011) areas. It ap-
pears that they are distributed worldwide within the
marine environment and its biota. Depending on the
type and shape of the polymer, an increased bioavail-
ability of adsorbed organic chemical compounds to
marine environments could be observed (Browne et al.
2011), which further emphasises the environmental
risks of microplastics to marine biota.

3.3.1 Comparisons Amongst the Studied Areas

The island of Trindade was predominately contaminated
with microplastics in the form of fibres and strands
when the area of the Petri dish and the total number of
tows were considered (Table 5). However, no significant
differences to the other islands were reported when both
the total sample area (ANOVA, p=0.345) and density
(mm2/m3) (p=0.331) of fibres were considered. Simi-
larly, no significant patterns were reported for the lee-
ward and windward sides of the islands.

Around the island of Trindade, fishing is a regular
activity, even in swallow waters&amp;lt;2 km from the island
(Pinheiro et al. 2010). Four different fisheries were iden-
tified (i.e. pelagic longline, bottom line, trolling and
handline), which included the Brazilian fleet and clandes-
tine vessels (Pinheiro et al. 2010). Indeed, signs of
overfishing are evident (Pinheiro et al. 2010, 2011). In
the São Pedro e São Paulo Archipelago, fishing was
mainly associated with the occurrence of plastic threads
(Ivar do Sul et al. 2013). This association was also
reported in other studies on worldwide microplastic pol-
lution (e.g. Moore et al. 2001; Morét-Ferguson et al.
2010). If fishing or maritime activities as a whole are
confirmed as potential sources of microplastic fibres and
strands to the marine environment, this type of pollution

threatens all the insular habitats in this study, the Brazilian
EEZ and the entire western tropical Atlantic.

4 Final Remarks

Floating microplastic particles are polluting the western
tropical Atlantic, as confirmed by neustonic tows that were
conducted around important insular environments.
Microplastic pollution is most likely to be widespread over
the entire surface of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially
regarding the types of items. In this study, the contamina-
tion patterns were less than 1,000 particles km-2. The
counterpart gyre in the North Atlantic is significantly more
contaminated with microplastics (&gt;20,000 particles km-2 at
30° N) (Law et al. 2010); however, densities similar to
those measured in our study have been reported in the
Caribbean Sea.

Secondary source microplastics were largely domi-
nant, which is a pattern that has also been reported for
other oceanic basis, including subtropical gyres. The
prevalence of fragments makes inferences about sources
limited. Their origin is likely from either land-based or
marine-based sources, such as from damaged fishing
gear or other maritime activities that are performed at
sea. However, only a few categories of items were
sampled in this survey (Fig. 2), which was a recurring
finding for all of the islands studied. Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that at least part of these fragments
originated from the same source, which is occurring in
the entire western Atlantic Ocean. FTIR analysis is the
standard method that is used to conclusively determine
the type of polymer, which reveals information regard-
ing the possible source and origin of the microplastic
fragment in the marine environment.

The presence of marine-based sources, if confirmed,
emphasises the increased vulnerability of these islands
and its organisms to marine pollution. Floating plastics
emanate from everywhere, and there is currently no
mechanism to abate this type of pollution (see recent
discussion in Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). Scientific
predictions suggest that climate changes may affect cir-
culation patterns and, consequently, the movement, accu-
mulation and retention of plastic debris in space and time
(Howell et al. 2012). The presented results could then
also be used as a threshold measurement for contamina-
tion patterns in the western tropical Atlantic region.

Because the presence of microplastic debris was
confirmed, it is important to predict the probable threat

Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:2004 Page 11 of 13, 2004



it poses to the marine biota in the western tropical
Atlantic. Microplastics are known to be ingested by
vertebrates and invertebrates in the plankton, nekton
and benthos communities, which introduces them into
the marine food web (Ivar do Sul and Costa 2014). The
islands of Fernando de Noronha, Abrolhos and Trindade
are, naturally, regions of high endemism and are most at
risk for microplastic debris pollution.

For example, the Abrolhos Archipelago shelters the
richest marine biodiversity in the South Atlantic Ocean
(Werner et al. 2000). The archipelago is also an impor-
tant region for the calving and feeding of newborn
humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) along the
Brazilian coast. The ingestion of microplastics by ceta-
ceans was reported in the Mediterranean Sea (Fossi et al.
2012); therefore, whales, including pups and juveniles,
are at the eminent risk of ingesting microplastic pollu-
tion in the archipelago.

In conclusion, the evidence of microplastic pollution
in this study and in the São Pedro e São Paulo Archi-
pelago (Ivar do Sul et al. 2013) confirm that microplastic
pollution is widespread throughout the western tropical
Atlantic Ocean. In the near future, it is also important to
investigate the marine region adjacent to the Rocas
Atoll, where microplastics are also likely to be found.
The focus of the scientific community must be on the
continuous process of identifying sources of
microplastic debris in the global oceans.

Abstract 

Microplastics are widespread throughout oceans and seas and beaches are no exceptions. 

On beach sediments microplastics (&lt;5mm) are commonly prevalent over macroplastics 

(&gt;5mm), where fragments of larger items are sampled in greater amounts. The occurrence 

and characteristics of microplastics were investigated in beaches of Fernando de Noronha, 

Abrolhos and Trindade islands in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean. Despite no 

microplastic pollution was; identified in Abrolhos, small spatial variations were detected 

in Fernando de Noronha and Trinidade islands.

Introduction 

Macroplastics fragment on beach environments (i.e., secondary source fragments) 

(Andrady, 2011) and these fragments have been incorporated in coastal sediments around 

the world (Barnes et al., 2009). Field data confirm that microplastics (&amp;lt;5mm) are an 

abundant size fraction of plastic debris pollution (e.g., Browne et al., 2011) being 

widespread throughout the oceans and seas (e.g., Depledge et al., 2013, Ivar do Sul and 

Costa, 2014), including deep-sea sediments (Cauwenberghe et al., 2013). Virgin plastic 

pellets and other particles manufactured to be of a microscopic size (i.e., primary source 

microplastics) are also incorporated to beach sediments after storm-water discharges and 

direct spills into the sea (e.g., McDermid and McMullen, 2004, Fendall and Sewell, 2009, 

Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).  

Microplastics are probably much more hazardous than macroplastics to marine 

organisms from every level of the marine food web though ingestion (Wright et al., 2013). 

Evidences suggest that microplastic fragments, including fibres, can mimic natural food 

inciting ingestion events (Moore, 2008). Microplastic particles are also more efficient in 

the transport of sorbed organic and inorganic contaminants to remote areas, and can 

contaminate organisms once ingested (Tanaka et al., 2013).  

Microplastics have been sampled on beach sediments through different methods, 

most focused on the recent particles deposited on the surface (e.g., Barnes et al., 2009, 

Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). On mud sediments around industrialised areas, microplastics 

in the form of fibres are been commonly related to sewage and wastewater discharges 

(Browne et al., 2011). In oceanic islands, where small-sized sediments (i.e., sand) 

accumulate, beaches are frequently reported to be heavily impacted by ocean-borne 

plastics in the same size range of sediments, mainly in the Pacific Ocean (McDermid and 

McMullen, 2004, Moore, 2008, Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012, Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). 

In addition, in the Atlantic Ocean, primary source microplastic particles originating far 

from their shores and fragments were sampled on sandy beaches in the Fernando de 

Noronha archipelago (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). Moreover, it is expected (Barnes et al., 

2009, Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014) that this type of marine debris pollution currently 

contaminates other insular beaches in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean, but the extent 

of the problem is still unknown.  

Hence, the present study investigated, for the first time, the assessment of 

microplastic contamination (occurrence and physic characteristics) deposited on beaches 

in the Abrolhos archipelago and Trindade island, in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean 



13 
 

(Figure 1A), including a sample re-purposing in the Fernando de Noronha archipelago. 

Different aspects related to microplastic debris contamination were assessed and 

discussed. 

Material and Methods 

A total of 20 beaches were surveyed once in Fernando de Noronha (3°S, 32°W) 

(13 beaches), Abrolhos (17°S, 38°W) (3 beaches) and Trindade (20°S, 29°W) (4 beaches) 

islands during the austral summer season (2011/2012, 2012/2013). One sediment sample 

(80 g) was collected in the centre of the beach arc to grain size characterization. The dry 

sieving method and the Folk and Ward (1957) classification were applied in this study 

(Table 1).  

In the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, the circulation of the atmosphere (i.e., 

southeast trade winds and the westerlies) primarily drives the upper ocean large-scale 

circulation in the southern hemisphere. The nearest oceanic moorings 

(http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pirata/) were consulted to classify the sampled beaches into 

two groups: windward (9) and leeward (11) beaches, according to the prevailing winds in 

the area of the islands (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014) (Table 1).  

For microplastic survey, the strandline (1m wide) was sampled by scraping the 

two first centimetres of sand from 900cm2 quadrats (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). Three 

quadrats were thrown along the strandline on each surveyed beach. Then, a total of 60 

samples was collected. Sediment samples were taken to the laboratory where they were 

oven-dried at 100°C overnight. The dry samples were weighted and sieved through a 0? 

(1mm) sieve. Two types of plastics were identified and classified as hard plastic 

fragments and virgin plastic pellets (Figure 1D, E). Individual items were then sorted by 

size class and colour, measured and photographed. All images were obtained with the 

AxioVs40 V 4.8.2.0 software from Carl Zeiss Vision. 

Density of plastics particles was expressed as particles per square meter 

(particles/m²). Two hypotheses were tested with the Factorial Analysis of Variance 

(ANOVA): (1) there are differences in the total amounts of microplastics on windward 

and leeward beaches and; (2) types of microplastic particles are recurrent among the 

studied islands, but hard plastic fragments are prevalent. Data was transformed (Box-Cox 

transformation) to achieve normality, whilst homoscedasticity was tested with Levene’s 

test. Where ANOVA showed a significant difference, an a posteriori Fisher LSD test was 

used to determine which mean was significantly different (?=0.05).

Results and Discussion 

In this study, the presence of microplastics on insular beaches in the western 

tropical Atlantic Ocean was confirmed for the first time in the Trindade island (Figure 1); 

however, no plastic particle was found in sand samples from beaches of the Abrolhos 

archipelago. Microplastics were once again sampled on sandy beaches in the Fernando 

de Noronha archipelago as previously reported (Ivar do Sul et al., 2009).

V 4.8.2.0 software from Carl Zeiss Vision.  

 

A total of 1,151 plastic particles were detected in sand samples in this survey. 

Twenty-three quadrats (40%) in 12 beaches (60%) were contaminated (Table 2). In the 

Trindade island, three beaches were contaminated, but no plastic particle was sampled on 

Príncipe beach (leeward side). In Fernando de Noronha, five beaches are at this time free 

from this type of marine pollution; a single fragment was sampled on three beaches; and 

five other beaches presented higher contamination hates (Table 2). 

Quantitatively, windward beaches were more contaminated by plastic particles 

than the leeward beaches when all sampled beaches were considered (Hypothesis 1). This 

result confirmed the influence of surface currents transporting floating marine debris in 

the open ocean (i.e., Ivar do Sul et al., 2009). On the other hand, the absence of 

microplastic particles in Abrolhos Island during this survey is probably due to the beach 

sediment dynamics, which may remove all the sand, and consequently plastics, from 

beaches. This process is cyclical, and may underestimate microplastic particles sampling 

in a specific time.

In the islands of Fernando de Noronha and Trindade, mean densities of 

microplastics were lower than in the Eastern Island (805 ± 320.1 items/m²), which was 

significantly more contaminated than other beaches along the Chilean coast (Hidalgo-

Ruz and Thiel, 2013). The Eastern Island is close to the eastern-centre region of the South 

Pacific subtropical gyre, where pelagic plastics accumulate (Lebreton et al., 2012), 

showing that ocenic islands actually act as deposit sites for pelagic microplastic debris at 

sea (Moore, 2008, Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013). On Trindade windward beaches, 

however, densities reached the same order of magnitude than in the South Pacific Ocean 

(Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013). Since this island is far from (1,100km) the continental 

shores, ocean-borne plastics may be prevalent over land-based sources of plastic debris.

Characteristics of microplastic particles 

Microplastics have an average size of 3.72±2.21 mm in this study. Only two types 

of plastics were identified (hard plastic fragments and pellets) showing that types of items 

are recurrent in the tropical Atlantic (Ivar do Sul et al., 2013, Ivar do Sul et al., 2014). In 

terms of number of items, hard plastic fragments (Figure 1C) accounted for 60% of 

microplastic parricles (n=697). The numerical dominance of hard plastic fragments over 

virgin plastic pellets (Figure 1D) is a predicted trend, according to the literature, in the 

Pacific (Kushio and Noda, 2003, McDermid and McMullen, 2004, Hidalgo-Ruz and 

Thiel, 2013, Moore 2008) and Atlantic oceans (Browne et al., 2010). However, densities 

(particles/m²) of hard plastic fragments were not significantly different than pellets 

(p=0.416) in the studied islands (Hypothesis 2).  

Fibres and strands (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014) were not detected during this survey. 

In the North Sea, fragments were completely absent whereas fibres and pellets were 

systematically sampled on the sediment surface of coastal islands (Liebezeit and Dubaish, 

2013). Moreover, synthetic fibres are being related to sewage discharges, including 

washing machine effluents, mainly around high-populated areas (Browne et al., 2011). 

The absence of fibres and the occurrence of plastic pellets may also indicate that 

microplastics were mostly from marine-based sources, and consequently transported by 

ocean currents, when compared with sewage discharges (e.g., Claessens et al., 2011, 

Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2013).  

In this study, white and transparent plastic particles were more prevalent (75%) as 

previously observed elsewhere (e.g., Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). The colour distribution 

of the plastics on beaches, as well as on the sea surface (Ivar do Sul et al., 2014), may be 

an indicator of the residence time of the plastic on beach environments, the most likely 

site for generation of microplastics in the marine environment (Andrady, 2011). 

Final remarks 

This study confirms the widespread occurrence of microplastics in the marine 

ecosystem, especially considering that those islands as far away from direct sources of 

land-based contamination (e.g., rivers, drainage systems), which are major sources of 

plastics to the environment (Browne et al., 2011).  

Spatial variation in microplastic concentrations was observed on a relatively small 

scale (distance of few km) in Fernando de Noronha and Trindade. This may be due to 



18 
 

different current patterns, grain sizes, wave action and wind exposure of each beach. All 

beaches are isolated from obvious plastic debris sources (i.e., dense human population 

centres, plastic facilities). Then, it is most likely that plastics came from the adjacent 

marine area, where ships and fishing boats generate pelagic plastics, which are recognized 

sources of plastic debris to the marine environment (e.g., Andrady, 2011, Ivar do Sul and 

Costa, 2014) or from long-range transport of items (Barnes et al., 2009).  

Beyond the already established effects of ingestion, chemical leaching, and 

contaminant adsorption (e.g., Moore, 2008), plastic pellets and microplastic fragments 

may change the physical properties of beaches by increasing permeability and lowering 

subsurface temperatures (~1°C) (Carson et al., 2011). This can affect the sex of 

temperature-determinant organisms, such as sea turtles (e.g., a reduction in the number 

of females). Bioturbation of sediments on sea turtles nesting areas may also redistribute 

microplastics along the surface layer (1m), underestimating the amounts of sampled 

plastics. These might affect the quantification of beach plastics in Trindade and Fernando 

de Noronha since these islands are important nesting areas for Chelonia mydas.  

 Currently, the most widely used (~90%) synthetic plastics are low- and high-

density polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene 

(PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Andrady, 2011). These polymers have been 

successfully identified in sediment samples by FTIR and other techniques (e.g., Browne 

et al., 2010, 2011), including pellets (e.g., Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti, 2012). Eroded 

PE pellets had their surface areas enlarged, indicating that they will interact more 

efficiently with chemical compounds in the marine environment (Fotopoulou and 

Karapanagioti, 2012). Microplastics fragments will probably follow the same pattern, 

representing greater risks to organisms through ingestion.  

Recently, new methods to sample, quantify and/or identify microplastics on 

sediments have been developed by several research groups. Since a range of different 

methods have been applied, a direct comparison of data from different studies is not 

advisable (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014). Thus, a precise and comprehensive diagnosis of 

this kind of marine contamination on sedimentary habitats remains to be done.

CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

Os principais objetivos propostos para esta tese de Doutorado foram alcançados. Em 

consonância com a comunidade científica internacional, que vem reportando de maneira acelerada a 

contaminação por microplásticos em diversas bacias oceânicas, os diferentes enfoques abordados 

(amostras de água e de sedimento) representam importantes indícios de contaminação por 

microplásticos no oeste do Oceano Atlântico tropical. Os métodos amostrais empregados neste 

trabalho são amplamente utilizados por pesquisadores em várias partes do mundo, e são considerados 

capazes de diagnosticar o problema da poluição por microplásticos com eficiência.  

Os tipos de partículas plásticas amostrados neste estudo possivelmente ocorrem na superfície do 

mar em todo setor oeste do oceano Atlântico tropical. Suas quantidades, entretanto, podem variar com 

a proximidade de ilhas, de fontes em terra e rotas de navegação em oceano aberto. Fragmentos plásticos 

duros foram amostrados na superfície do mar e também nas praias arenosas, mostrando que as águas 

oceânicas podem ser a fonte destes tipos de plásticos para as praias arenosas de ilha oceânicas. 

 Durante o curso deste doutorado (2010-2014), estudos específicos sobre microplásticos 

ganharam espaço não só em revistas científicas, muitas de alto fator de impacto, mas também em 

outros veículos de informação voltados ao público em geral. A Revista Marine Pollution Bulletin, 

pioneira na divulgação de estudos sobre lixo marinho, ainda continua sendo a principal escolha dos 

pesquisadores da área. Entretanto, outras revistas já dão importante destaque ao tema (por exemplo, 

Environmental Pollution, Environmental Science and Technology, entre outras).  

 Em agosto de 2103 quando foi concluída a revisão da literatura sobre o tema (Capítulo I), cerca 

de 130 artigos sobre microplásticos tinham sido publicados. Três meses depois, em novembro de 2013, 

quando o artigo foi disponibilizado no site da revista, este número já atingia facilmente a marca de 150 

artigos, todos publicados em revistas disponíveis no Portal de Periódicos da CAPES. Atualmente (maio 

de 2014), mais de 200 artigos sobre a presença e os efeitos da poluição por microplásticos já estão 

disponíveis! Seus desdobramentos possivelmente são assunto para uma nova Tese de Doutorado. O 

reconhecimento dos esforços da comunidade brasileira que estuda resíduos plásticos poderia ser feito 

através de oportunidades de financiamento diretamente voltadas ao tema, com editais específicos para 

a amostragem e identificação de microplásticos, e modernização dos laboratórios a exemplo da União 

Europeia.  

 Primeiramente, a confirmação da presença de microplásticos em importantes ambientes 

insulares brasileiros expõe a vulnerabilidade destes ambientes a este tipo de poluição já que parte das 

fontes de plásticos estão baseadas no mar e são de difícil controle, fiscalização e até mesmo de sua 

identificação precisa. Cada embarcação realizando as mais diversas atividades marítimas pode ser uma 



22 

 

fonte potencial de plásticos para o ambiente. Neste sentido faz-se imprescindível o completo 

estabelecimento do Anexo V da Convenção Internacional para Prevenção da Poluição por Navios 

(MARPOL 1973/75), endossado pelo Brasil há mais de 30 anos. O cenário atual indica, entretanto, 

que a MARPOL não vem sendo cumprida em sua totalidade. O problema é muito amplo, englobando, 

por exemplo, a melhora na infraestrutura dos portos brasileiros para o recebimento adequado do lixo 

gerado a bordo.  

 Em 2014, 40 anos após o estabelecimento da MARPOL, começa a ser implementada no Brasil 

a Política Nacional dos Resíduos Sólidos (PNRS), sancionada em 2010. A lei nº 12.305, de 2 de agosto 

de 2010, dispõe sobre a “gestão integrada e o gerenciamento de resíduos sólidos, incluídos os 

perigosos, às responsabilidades dos geradores e do poder público e aos instrumentos econômicos 

aplicáveis”. Décadas após o estabelecimento de legislações internacionais sobre a poluição marinha, 

que apontas as fontes baseadas em terra como responsáveis por ~80% dos plásticos encontrados no 

ambiente marinho, espera-se que ações previstas na PNRS, ao menos, minimizem a entrada de itens 

plásticos grandes nos ambientes costeiros. Isso em vista desta nova legislação não abordar o tema 

microplásticos em seu texto e não prever ações específicas neste contexto.  

 Dois dos ambientes insulares estudados são Parques Nacionais Marinhos, ou seja, Unidades de 

Conservação de proteção integral de categoria II definidas pelo Sistema Nacional de Unidades de 

Conservação da Natureza (SNUC) (Lei nº 9.985, de 18 de julho de 2000). Neste caso, a predominância 

de fontes marinhas de plásticos enfatiza a vulnerabilidade destes ambientes e também a falta a de 

eficiência das medidas de proteção exigidas, já que todos os grupos animais marinhos que compõem 

a teia trófica estão expostos ao risco de ingestão de microplásticos e suas consequências nos ambientes 

estudados.
