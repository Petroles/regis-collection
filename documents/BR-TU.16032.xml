ABSTRACT 

Tantalum is a metal which has shown to have excellent biocompatibility and 

bioactivity, making it a potential material for dental implant. Nano texturing can improve 

the performance of Ta dental implant as it promotes faster osseointegration. Nano texturing 

changes surface roughness which affects the tribological behavior.   

An electrochemical process called anodization was used to modify the surface 

of tantalum by introducing highly ordered nano pores on its surface. Anodization is a 

process that involves several parameters which can be easily modified to produce 

controlled surface texturing. The applied potential has a propotional relationship to pore 

diameter and Ta2O5 film thickness. Higher applied potential leads to larger pore diameters 

and thicker oxide layer. For the purpose of this thesis, tantalum was anodized at three 

different potentials, namely 15, 25 and 50 V. The purpose of this thesis was to test the 

effect of surface roughness induced by anodization, on the tribological properties of Ta, 

particularly its static friction behavior. The surface roughness parameter used for this study 

was the mean peak to valley height of profile (Rz). Reference samples used for comparison 

were polished Ta metal and chemically etched Ta.  

Structural analysis of the prepared Ta samples was performed by optical 

microscopy, surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM), the crystal structure was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), hardness was 

measured using Vickers hardness method and surface roughness measurements were made 

by a 3-D profilometer. Friction tests were performed using a standard tensile testing 

machine with electronic control of cross head motion.  

Highly ordered nano porous surface was formed by the anodization process. 

The size of pores increased when higher anodization potentials were used. The anodization 

process caused a change in surface roughness. The relationship between surface roughness 

and the static friction coefficient was studied and it was found that static friction 

coefficient showed a propotional relationship to surface roughness. Dynamic friction 

coefficient did not show a clear relation to surface roughness.

RESUMO 

O Tântalo (Ta) é um elemento metálico com excelentes propriedades no que 

diz respeito a biocompatibilidade e bioatividade, demonstrando possuir um enorme 

potencial para ser usado em implantes odontológicos. A nano-texturização pode melhorar o 

desempenho de implantes dentários promovendo um aumento por parte da integração 

óssea. No entanto, a alteração da rugosidade superficial através desta técnica de superfície 

pode afetar o seu comportamento tribológico. No presente trabalho, foi utilizado um 

processo eletroquímico conhecido como anodização de forma a modificar a superfície do 

Ta através da introdução de nano poros, altamente ordenados. A anodização é um processo 

que envolve a utilização de vários parâmetros que podem ser facilmente modificados, 

permitindo obter um maior controle sobre a texturização da superfície do elemento. Existe 

uma relação diretamente proporcional entre o potencial aplicado (Volts-V) e o diâmetro 

dos poros assim como a espessura dos filmes de Ta2O5. Quanto maior for o potencial 

aplicado, maior será o diâmetro dos poros e mais espessa será a camada de óxido formada 

sobre a superfície de Ta. 

O presente trabalho tem como objetivo o estudo do efeito da alteração da 

rugosidade na superfície de Ta induzida por anodização, assim como, a influência sobre as 

propriedades tribológicas, em particular o seu comportamento à fricção estática. Para que 

este estudo fosse possível foi realizada a análise estrutural e morfológica de amostras 

anodizadas a três potenciais diferentes: 15, 25 e 50 V.  

A análise estrutural das amostras de Ta foi avaliada com recurso à técnica de 

difração de raios-X (DRX), a morfologia da superfície foi estudada por microscopia de 

varrimento eletrónico (SEM), a dureza classificada segundo a escala de Vickers e a 

rugosidade avaliada através de um perfilómetro 3-D. Os ensaios de desgaste foram 

realizados utilizando uma máquina de ensaios de tração com controlo numérico. Os 

resultados obtidos foram comparados com amostras de Ta sem qualquer tratamento 

superficial.  

O processo de anodização permitiu obter superfícies nano porosas 

extremamente ordenadas. O tamanho das porosidades aumentou com o aumento do 

potencial de anodização. A utilização do processo de anodização possibilitou uma 

alteração da rugosidade superficial. A relação entre a rugosidade superficial e o coeficiente 

de atrito estático, foi comparada, verificando-se que o valor de coeficiente de atrito é

1. INTRODUCTION 

A dental implant is an artificially constructed tooth root which is integrated 

with an artificially made tooth crown to replace missing teeth [1]. When the implant is 

inserted inside the jaw, a healing process takes place. The healing process is called 

osseointegration, which occurs when the bone cells surround the implant grow into a 

network around the artificial prosthetic, hence holding it firmly in place. The growing bone 

cells are called osteoblasts. Their adhesion to the implant surface greatly depends on the 

implant geometry and surface properties. Biocomplatibility is the most essential property 

required for dental implant materials. In this regards tantalum seems to be a good option. 

Modification of surface properties of a dental implant has been given special 

focus in terms of accelerating the healing process. Particularly surface roughness has been 

identified as an important parameter in this respect [2]. Several surface texturing 

techniques have been used in the past but each of them has certain drawbacks. Most 

importantly, the techniques do not provide easy control of surface roughness. Anodization 

is an electrochemical technique that has been employed in the past for surface texturing. 

The parameters involved in this technique can be easily controlled, hence giving the user to 

ability to control the surface roughness. The technique can be used to achieve surface 

roughness values from the micron scale down to the nano scale.  

The tribological behavior of a textured dental implant surface plays a 

significant role in its performance. When a dental implant is inserted inside the jaw, ideally 

it should become anchored firmly with no motion. The efficiency of mechanical 

interlocking between the textured surface and the surrounding bone decides the degree of 

the anchorage. The mechanical interlocking also decides how much force would be 

required to slide the contacting surfaces against each other. In a dental implant sliding 

should not exist. Therefore, the textured surface should have a surface roughness that 

enables it to efficiently interlock with the bone structure. In other words, its static friction 

coefficient should be as high as possible. However, dental implants have shown to exhibit 

some fretting motion. Fretting can lead to wear debris and loosely anchored dental implant. 

Therefore it is essential to study the tribological behavior of the material used for dental 

implant in order to validate its suitability for the application. 

The purpose of this master’s thesis is to study the tribological behavior of 

micro/nano anodized tantalum surface by anodization to be used as dental implant

materials. Tantalum surfaces with different nano pore sizes have been made by anodization 

and the tribological performance of these surfaces in contact with bone will be evaluated. 

1.1.  Objectives  

The aim of this master thesis research work is to measure and analyze the 

tribological behavior of micro/nano textured tantalum surfaces formed by anodization 

method. Anodization is an electrochemical technique that has been employed in the past 

for surface texturing of materials for different applications. For dental implants, surface 

texturing has been performed to accelerate the healing process. The anodization technique 

involves several parameters which can be easily controlled to modify the surface texture 

and to achieve highly ordered nanopores. For this thesis, the applied potential was varied 

while keeping all other parameters (time, electrolyte, current and temperature) constant. 

Increasing the potential causes the pore diameter and the tantalum oxide layer thickness to 

increase.  

Surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscope 

(SEM), the crystal structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the surface roughness by 3-D 

profilometry and hardness by vickers hardness test. The tribological characterization was 

done by using a friction coefficient measurement device which was originally developed in 

CEMUC. The setup was operated by a standard tensile testing machine where the cross 

head motion was controlled electronically. The wear marks were analyzed under an optical 

microscope. The friction tests were performed at both dry and wet conditions. For the wet 

conditions, the ageing effect of saliva was studied by immersing the samples in aritificial 

saliva for 3 days, after which, friction tests were performed. 

1.2. Thesis Structure 

This thesis titled “Tribological properties of micro/nano textured tantalum 

surfaces by anodization method” was performed as partial requirement for the completion 

of masters in tribology of surfaces and interface (TRIBOS).  

The thesis is divided into five parts. Chapter 1 describes the objectives and 

structure of the thesis. The state of the art is presented in Chapter 2. The experimental 

methods and the materials used as well as the characterization techniques are explained in

2. STATE OF THE ART 

2.1. Dental Implants 

Tantalum is a high density, high strength and high hardness metal. It has been 

studied in the past for its possible biomedical applications and it has shown to have good 

biocompatibility and bioactivity [1], [2]. The factors that contribute to the high bioactivity 

in tantalum are its higher surface wettability and surface energy as compared to titanium 

which lacks bioactivity [25], therefore tantalum has potential application as dental implant.  

A dental implant is an artificially constructed tooth root which is integrated 

with artificially made tooth crown to replace missing teeth [1]. A dental implant is 

designed to match as closely as possible to the real tooth root. A comparison of natural 

tooth and a dental implant is given in Figure 2.1. 

 
 

Figure 2.1. Tooth vs. Implant Comparison [5] 

In this figure the different components of artificial tooth are given. The implant 

is in direct contact with the surrounding bone. When the implant is inserted inside the jaw, 

a healing process takes place. The healing process is called osseointegration. The concept 

of osseointegration was first introduced by Brånemark [3]. In his research paper he 

concluded that the typical healing time for a dental implant is 3 to 6 months. Since the 

advent of dental implants in 1965 [4], various methods of improving the performance of 

the artificial prosthetic have been researched. Osseointegration occurs when the bone cells

surround the implant grow into a network around the artificial prosthetic, hence holding it 

firmly in place. The growing bone cells are called osteoblasts. Their adhesion to the 

implant surface greatly depends on the implant geometry and surface properties. Titanium 

is a popular material used to make dental implant due to its excellent corrosion resistance, 

high strength and excellent biocomplatibility. Titanium forms an oxide upon exposure to 

air. The oxide layer is biocompatible and bioinert . Hence bone cells are not easily bonded 

with its surface, resulting in the formation of a fibrous tissue layer which subsequently 

separates the metal surface from the cells. Tantalum is another biocompatible material 

which forms a bioactive oxide layer on its surface and thus has exhibited a behavior much 

closer to real bone behavior than titanium [25]. Therefore this research has focused on 

tantalum as a dental implant material because tantalum holds the promise of a faster and 

more effective healing process. 

2.2.  Surface modification of dental implant 

Modification of surface properties has been given special focus in terms of 

improved biocompatibility of dental implant material. Particularly surface roughness has 

been identified as an important parameter in the acceleration of healing process [2]. A 

research study was conducted by Albrektsson &amp;amp; Wennerberg [7] on the effect of surface 

roughness on dental implant performance. They focused their research on four most 

commonly used commercially available dental implants. They categorized dental implants 

according to their surface roughness values as: smooth (Sa &amp;lt;0.5 µm), minimally rough (Sa 

= 0.5-1.0 µm), moderately rough (Sa = 1.0-2.0 µm) and rough (Sa &gt; 2.0 µm) [2]. The 

researchers also introduced a new surface roughness parameter, developed surface area 

ratio (Sdr) which takes into account the density of peaks (Sds) and surface roughness (Sa). 

Hence it is a hybrid parameter used to estimate the heights and peaks of a surface [2]. 

Surface roughness can be divided into three levels based on scale [8]: macro, micro and 

nano scaled roughness. 

Several surface modification techniques have been used in the past. The most 

commonly used surface modification techniques are: sand blasting (mechanical method), 

acid etching (chemical method), plasma spraying (coating method), laser modification and 

anodization (electrochemical method) [8].  

Sand blasting is a process by which the surface is impinged by particles, 

creating grooves and craters. This way the surface roughness is increased. Wennerberg et.

al. performed extensive research on this method of surface modification on commercially 

pure titanium implants [9][10]. They were able to conclude that the surface roughness 

depends on the size, speed, density and shape of the impinging particle. The impinging 

particles used were titanium oxide and aluminum oxide. A drawback of sand blasting is 

that sometimes the particles can become buried in the surface. Typical surface roughness 

values obtained from this method are 0.5 – 2.0 µm [2]. 

Acid etching is a technique by which an acid is used to pit the surface, 

selectively removing some grains and grain boundaries. A surface can be made of different 

phases. Compositional differences result in different sensitivity to acid etching. Hence, 

some phases are more easily removed than others, resulting in increased surface roughness 

by pitting. The surface roughness depends on the type of acid used, soaking time and 

material surface composition. Typical surface roughness values obtained from acid etching 

are 0.3 – 1.0 µm [2].  

Coating methods such as plasma spraying have been used in the past as well. 

Groot et. al. researched the possibility of improving the biocompatibility of titanium 

implants by coating the surface with hydroxyapatite [11]. Their reason for using this 

particular coating is its close match with bone. Past research has shown that the coating 

effectively increases osseointegration, However, the coatings have weak adhesion on the 

metal surface. They can dissolve when the implant is inserted or develop long term failure 

[12].  

2.2.1. Anodization  

Bone cells (osteoblasts) have been shown to exhibit greater adhesion to nano-

textured titanium than to conventional titanium [12]-[14]. Hence, nanotexturing has shown 

to improve the osseointegration process. Anodization is an electrochemical technique that 

has been employed in the past for surface texturing of materials for different applications. 

In the medical sector, anodization has been used to modify the surface properties of 

implants. The anodization process consists of three major steps as given in literature [12]: 

alkaline cleaning, acid activation and electrolyte anodizing. The anodization is an 

electrochemical process which is carried out in a typical three electrode cell: Sample 

anode, platinum cathode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The two electrode cell can also 

be used. The technique can be used in two modes: constant potential and constant current. 

Anodization has been used for inducing micro and nanopores on tantalum oxide surface, in

past research. The electrochemical reactions and ions diffusion that take places during the 

process lead to the formation of an oxide on the anode.  

The earliest studies on anodization involved high voltage anodization (ASD). 

The mechanism behind surface texturing by this method can be explained by the avalanche 

theory [12]. When an oxide film forms it acts as a dielectric barrier to current flow. As the 

potential is increase, the film continues to grow until the dielectric breakdown limit is 

reached. At this point, the weaker regions of the heterogenous oxide film undergo thermal 

stressing and subsequent breakdown. The exposed metal below the oxide starts forming an 

oxide layer again. Therefore the process involves a balance between the growth and 

breakdown of the oxide film. The balance is dependent on the processing parameters given 

above, especially the type of electrolyte chosen for the technique plays a major role. Figure 

2.2 shows the anodization process:

formation), (C) immediate repassivation of pore tips, (D) burst of repassivated oxide, and (E) 

dissolution of the formed oxide and second repassivation [16]. 

There are several parameters that control the anodization process [12]: 

electrolyte composition &amp;amp; concentration 

? Potential 

? Current  

? pH (type of acid used) 

? temperature 

? time 

The effect of different types of electrolytes on oxide growth has been studied in 

the past by Sul et. al.[15]. They conducted their studies on the most commonly used 

electrolytes for anodization: sodium oxide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid,acetic acid and 

calcium hydroxide. They observed that acidic electrolytes produced thicker films than

nanotubes on oxide thin film by anodization. 

In 1980, Baun was able to form nanoporous TiO2 by anodization in chromic 

acid at 10-40 V [17].  Since then, a number of researchers have found that presence of 

hydrogen fluoride (HF) in electrolyte leads to formation of nanoporous structures TiO2 at 

relatively lower voltages [18]-[22].  

The effect of using different potential values in HF solution was studied by 

Gong et. al. [[23]] and they found that as potential is increased, the pore size increases but 

the final length of the nanotubes was independent of pore size [23].  

The pH of the electrolyte bath affects the ability of oxide to reform after 

breaking and the ability of electrolyte to dissolve the oxide [24]. Cai et. al. [25] studied the 

effect of electrolyte pH on the growth of nanotubes on titanium oxide surface. They 

observed that increasing the pH increases the time required for nanotube formation. Longer 

nanotubes could be obtained at higher pH [25]. Hence the nanotube length can be 

controlled by controlling the pH. The anodization time influences the nanotube wall 

thickness but does not affect the tube diameter. With an increase in time the tube wall 

thickness increases [24]. 

The pore wall thickness can be varied by changing the electrolyte bath 

temperature. This relationship was studied by Mor GK et. al. [26].  They found out that 

varying the temperature varied the process of electrochemical etching and chemical 

dissolution. They performed their experiments at a constant potential of 10 V and two 

different temperatures: 5 ?C and 50 ?C. The pore diameter is both cases was the same but 

the average pore wall thickness at 5 ?C was 34 nm and at 50 ?C it was 9 nm.  

Biological studies have shown a high healing rate in anodized nanoporous TiO2 

dental implant. This is due to the increased adhesion, attachment and growth of the 

osteoblasts on the bone-mimicking nanoporous surface. The osteoblasts have also shown to 

have a different morphology on anodized surface than on unanodized titanium. They show 

greater spreading on the surface of anodized titanium whereas they appear more rounded 

on unanodized titanium [13]. The nanotubular structure also promoted much higher 

calcium deposition by osteoblasts than the low roughness surface.  

In the extensive study and research on the application of titanium as a 

biocompatible material, it has been discovered that even though titanium oxide has 

excellent biocompatibility, it lacks sufficient osseointegration for implant longetivity [27].

As discussed in chapter 2.2, surface modification of dental implant, different surface 

texturing methods have been used to promote bioactivity in titanium surface by improving 

its adhesion and mechanically interlocking with bioactive coatings. Titanium oxide 

surfaces need to be coated with a more bioactive hydroxyapatite to improve their 

osseointegration performance. But ceramic porous coatings carry the risks of delamination, 

cracking and low fracture toughness [27]. A bioactive material should not require any 

coatings; its own surface should encourage bone growth [28]. Tantalum has come into the 

spotlight as a material with good bioactivity, high mechanical strength and excellent 

fatigue resistance [28]. The only reason its application in the medical field has been limited 

is the processing problems associated with the metal. Tantalum is an expensive material 

with a high melting point and high affinity to oxygen. This has posed as an obstacle in 

manufacturing of a fully dense tantalum implant. In 2010, Balla et. al. [27] performed laser 

coating of tantalum on titanium for bone replacement structures. Their study found that Ta 

coated implant showed enhanced cell attachment and proliferation as compared to titanium 

oxide surface. The enhanced osseointegration was attributed to the superior wettability and 

high surface energy of Ta surface [27]. Jafari et. al. [29] compared the performance of 

porous tantalum hip cup and hydroxyapatite coated titanium hip cup. Their aim was the 

compare the bioactivity of both materials. Ta hip cup exhibited superior performance than 

HA coated Ti cup. They concluded that Ta has clear potential for bone ingrowth whereas 

Ti surface has potential for bone ongrowths. It requires an assistive bioactive coating such 

as HA, hence it is not a true bone ingrowth surface (lacks bioactivity) [29].  

The anodization of tantalum oxide films, both amorphous and crystalline has 

been given special focus. The growth of dense oxide on tantalum in dilute phosphoric acid 

electrolyte was studied by Lu et. al. in 2002 [30]. The growth of porous Ta2O5 films in 

mixed H2SO4/HF electrolyte was studied by Sieber et. al.  [31]. It was found that the nearly 

uniform porous oxide can be achieved with pore diameter ranging from 2 to 10 nm. The 

morphology and thickness of the layer depends on applied potential, anodization time and 

the concentration of HF [31]. Anodization of tantalum has also been performed in non-

aqueous electrolytes consisting of glycerol with small quantities of NH4 [32]. It was found 

that porous layers of thickness up to 15 µm and pore diameters in the range of 10-40 nm 

can be achieved by optimizing the electrochemical conditions [32]. This study also 

confirmed the strong effect of fluoride concentration and applied potential on the 

morphology of the layers. Allama et. al. [33] studied the effect of using different 

concentrations of HF and H2SO4. In addition they also studied the effect of adding small

amounts of different additives such as H3PO4, ethylene glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide. 

They observed that pore diameter increases with increasing concentration of HF. Addition 

of H3PO4 resulted in growth of higher lengths of nanorods (1300 nm) and the other 

additives enabled fabrication of high aspect-ratio vertically oriented tantalum oxide 

nanotube array films [33]. 

Hence the same principals of controlling anodization parameters for texturing 

titanium can also be applied for tantalum oxide surface, making its processing an 

economical and simple task.  

Anodic oxidation of tantalum can be used to produce controlled surface 

porosity at the micro and nano scale. It has proven to be a simple, efficient technique for 

surface texturing of dental implants. Anodized surfaces have shown to have higher 

biocompatibility and lead to better adhesion and network formation from osteoblasts. Since 

tantalum has excellent biocompatibility, its nanoporous oxide surface can potentially lead 

to shorter healing time.  

2.3.  Dental implant/Bone interface: Tribological Problems 

The design of a dental implant may be improved and optimized to match as 

closely as possible to the real tooth but there will still be some differences. The mechanical 

interlocking between a dental implant surface and the surrounding bone is not as strong as 

the real biological surfaces of tooth and bone.  

In chapter 2.2 the importance of surface texturing was discussed.  Texturing of 

the implant surface is performed to provide it with a surface structure that will fit into the 

nano-porous structure of the bone. The two surfaces can ideally be thought of as having 

complimenting jigsaw pattern, although the mechanical interlocking would not be as 

perfect as a jigsaw. This interlocking provides the initial mechanical anchorage to the 

implant/bone interface while the bone grows around the implant. Friction plays a major 

role in the initial stability of immediately loaded dental implants [34].  It results from the 

mechanical interlocking of implant and bone surfaces. Good mechanical interlocking 

means that under loaded conditions the interface should undergo minor elastic 

deformations but no slippage, as slippage will lead to micro-motions which result in 

problems as will be explained further. Keeping this mechanical interlocking phenomenon 

in mind, researchers have been improving the surface properties of dental implants. In

1972, Predcki et. al. studied the effect of threaded implants as compared to smooth 

implants, on the attachment of bone [35]. They found that the threaded implants showed 

greater bone growth due to better mechanical interlocking and osseointegration. 

Researchers also developed porous coatings in order to improve friction properties of the 

implant [36]. The idea was that the increased surface roughness will improve implant 

fixation. But studies have found that only a small percentage of pore volume is actually 

filled with bone [37]-[39]. In 2012, Hasan et. al. researched an experimental approach to 

determine the friction coefficient of implant-antler interface [34]. The antler is similar in 

nature to human bone; hence the static and kinetic friction coefficients were measured. The 

static friction coefficient values came to be in the range of 0.5-0.7 and increasing sliding 

velocity decreased the friction coefficient [34]. A finite element method was also 

developed by Bulaqi et. al [40]  to study the effect of coefficient of friction on the preload 

induced at the implant/bone interface and other interfaces of implant system. They were 

able to conclude that coefficient of friction plays the most important role in implant screw 

loosening [40].  

In reality the implant’s surface does not interlock with the bone surface quite as 

efficiently as desired. This causes some micro-motion to occur between the implant and 

bone and the knowledge of the implications of this micro-motion on the performance of the 

dental implant is important. tribological implications. The following paragraphs explain the 

state of the art of the micro-motion problems that exist in dental implants.  

In the earliest studies on the application of titanium dental implants, the 

existence of some small degree of motion between the implant and bone was pointed out 

by Carlsson et. al.[41]. This small degree of motion is called fretting. Fretting is the 

tribological motion between two contacting surfaces under loaded condition, where the 

amplitude of the movement is less than 100 µm [42]. The dental implant/bone interface 

undergoes fretting wear due to the chewing motion of the mouth. The motion turns the 

dental implant/bone interface into a special tribological pair undergoing different stresses 

(tension, compression, shear) resulting in complex fretting and ultimately failure [1].  It is 

especially a prominent problem during the early stages of osseointegration. After insertion 

of the dental implant, the healing process takes a few months. In the primary healing phase 

the fretting motion is highest as the surrounding bone has not fully attached itself to the 

implant. The fretting behavior of titanium implants/cortical bone interface was studied by 

Yu et. al. in 2005 [43].

In a bio-tribological system, fretting will not just lead to production of wear 

debris and surface damage. One of the contacting surfaces is the bone which is a living 

tissue. It grows with time around the implant. The bio-response of the bone and the process 

of osseointegration are also affected due to fretting motion. Fretting in dental implant/bone 

interface can be divided into three types which are also illustrated in Figure 2.3 [44]: 

1. tangential fretting 

2. radial fretting 

3. dual-motion fretting 

 

 

 

Figure 2.3. Fretting modes existed in the dental implant/bone interface [44] 

 

Yu et. al. in their research on fretting of titanium implants as mentioned before, 

studied the tagential mode of fretting. They performed their experiments in-vitro by 

employing a titanium ball on bone flat geometry on a reciprocating tribometer modified for 

fretting. They were able to conclude that tagential fretting occurs due to delamination and 

abrasive wear [43].  

In 2008, Yu HY et. al. studied the radial fretting behavior of cortical bone/ 

titanium implant interface [45]. Radial fretting behaves quite differently from tagential 

fretting due to the different direction of loading. The researchers concluded from their 

study that radial fretting results in four types of cracks. The most common were along the 

cement line due to the deficiency of calcium and phosphate along those lines. ‘The second 

cracks initiate from or end at the Havers's canal. The third ones are cracks connecting two 

consecutive Havers's canals if the stress is big enough. Each Harvers's system is a relative 

independent structure, but it will release the stress energy to adjacent Harvers's system if it 

could not use out the high stress brought from cracks alone. The fourth type is that kind of 

cracks propagating at interstitial lamella linearly’ [45]. The four types of cracks are given 

in Figure 2.4 [44]:

Figure 2.4. Four kind of cracks in radial fretting test [44]. 

Since the implant/bone interface is loaded under different forms of stresses due 

to the masticatory movement, fretting at the interface cannot so simply be defined as 

purely tangential or radial. In fact, dual motion fretting occurs more commonly than either 

of the latter two. Keeping this in mind, Yu HY et. al. expanded their research in 2009 and 

studied the dual motion fretting behavior of titanium implant/bone interface [46]. They 

found that at low loads, the main wear mechanisms of dual motion fretting were adhesive 

and abrasive wear. At higher loads the main wear mechanisms were a combination of 

adhesive wear, abrasive wear, cracking and lubrication of human bone tissue debris [46].  

The comparison between radial fretting and dual motion fretting of cortical 

bone was made by Gao et. al. in 2010 [47]. They found that dual motion fretting produced 

more damage and more wear debris than radial fretting. Radial fretting produced 

significantly more cracks than dual motion fretting and the abundance of cracks was 

dependant on the bone microstructure. Radial fretting could thus be used to study the crack 

propagation of bone [47]. 

The bio-response of bone to the micro-motion in vivo has also been studied in 

the past. In the earliest researches concluded that micro-motion inhibited bone ingrowth 

into implant and led to the formation of a fibrous membrane between the implant/bone 

interface. The anchorage of bone to implant was therefore compromised [48] [49].  

In 1973, Cameron et. al. presented the idea of a threshold micro motion [50]. 

They suggested that fibrous membrane does not form at interface upto a certain value of 

micro-motion amplitude.  

In 1986, Pillar et. al. confirmed the existence of the threshold micro-motion. 

Their research led to the conclusion that micro motion values of 150 µm to 500 µm could 

lead to damage and membrane formation [51].  

In 1993, Brunski detailed his ideas on the problems of overloading and micro-

motion on dental implant/bone interface [52]. He suggested that “based on evidence so far, 

as a rule of thumb: relative motion of more than 100 microns should be avoided”. He also 

suggested that the threshold micro-motion cannot be fixed because it depends on the 

implant system.

14  2016 

 

In 2003, Gapski et. al. reviewed the effect of immediate implant loading [53]. 

He agreed with the past concepts of threshold micro-motion and Brunsk’s “rule of thumb”. 

Based on these, they differentiated two different kinds of micro-motions: tolerable and 

deleterious. They concluded that primary implant stability is the most important factor 

affecting immediate implant loading [53]. 

It can be concluded that tribological properties of a dental implant material 

play an important role in its performance and the tribological problems that can occur 

when a dental implant is integrated into the biological system need to be analyzed and 

solved before deeming a material suitable for this particular application.

3. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

3.1. Materials and methods 

The materials used for tribological test were tantalum samples and artificial 

bone material (epoxy resin reinforced by glass fibers). The preparation of these materials 

has been described in sub chapters of this topic (3.1.1 &amp;amp; 3.1.2). 

3.1.1. Tantalum sample preparation 

Tantalum sheets (T1-9000-D73), of purity 99.95% and thickness of 0.5 mm, 

were obtained from the supplier Testbourne. Tantalum samples were prepared by cutting 

the sheets to dimensions of 20 x 25 mm with a cutting machine. The burrs formed on the 

edge of the samples, from cutting the metal sheet, were removed by using grinding paper 

of grit size 320. In order to prepare the sample surface for anodization, both sides of the 

samples were polished on grinding papers of grit size size 250, 320, 500, 800, 1200 and 

2000, 2500 and 4000. Six conditions were defined for the treatment of the samples and 

these are summarized in Table 3.1. 

 

Table 3.1. Treatment conditions of tantalum samples 

 

No. Treatment 

1 Polished (reference) 

2 Polished and Anodized at potential of 15 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) 
3 Polished and Etched in HNO3:HF (1:1) solution (reference) 

4 Etched and Anodized at 15 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) 

5 Etched and Anodized at 25 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) 

6 Etched and Anodized at 50 V in H2SO4:HF (9:1) 

 

As Table 3.1 shows, two samples were used as reference. They differed in 

terms of their surface preparation i.e. mechanical polishing and chemical etching. The Ta 

sheets supplied had poor surface quality hence etching was employed to remove scratchs 

and irregularities from the surface. But since etching introduces pitting at the micron level 

on the metal surface, the effect of this micro porosity on the friction of the textured surface 

was also studied. Hence the mechanically polished sample was required for comparison in 

this case. The samples were etched in an acid solution consisting of nitric acid and 

hydrofluoric acid (1:1) for two minutes. Extreme care needed to be taken during the

etching process due to the use of highly corrosive liquids. The samples immersed in the 

solution were carefully stirred after every 30 seconds in order to ensure uniform etching. 

After etching treatment the samples were washed with distilled water and air dried. 

The samples underwent two-sided anodization as the schematic of the 

electrochemical setup show in Figure 3.1. As the name suggests, two-sided anodization 

causes both sides of a sample to be textured. This setup was designed at University of 

Minho by Professor Sandra Carvalho. The electrolyte solution used for anodization 

consisted of H2SO4 and HF in the ratio 9:1. The voltage was supplied by an electronic 

voltage source.The test was performed at galvanostatic conditions. The samples were fixed 

on a metallic sample holder and care was taken to immerse the samples only half way in, 

so as to avoid contact between the sample holder and the strong electrolyte as this could 

affect the anodization process. As soon as the sample was immersed in the electrolyte 

solution, the voltage source was turned on. During the experiment the electrolyte was 

constantly stirred by a magnetic stirrer in order to ensure uniform texturing on the sample 

surface. The electrochemical process ran for two minutes, after which the voltage source 

was turned off. The sample was removed and washed with distilled water to remove 

residue acid. A few nanotubes of Ta2O5 usually form during anodization and when the 

objective is to obtain nanopores, these need to be removed. Hence, the anodized sample 

was placed in another small beaker filled with distilled water and ultrasonic cleaning was

The samples were anodized at three different voltages in order to achieve 

different pore sizes on the oxide layer. Increasing the potential increases the pore size [23] 

as stated earlier in the state of the art. It should also be noted that increasing the voltage 

also increases the oxide film thickness [55]. Hence, the samples anodized at 50 V had a 

thicker oxide layer with a distinct grey-green color. Tantalum oxide tends to exhibit 

different colors depending on the applied voltage, and at around 50 V the oxide film 

usually exhibits a grey-green colour [56]. This phenomena was not observed on the surface 

of the samples anodized at 15 V and 25 V. The surface of the different samples was 

analyzed under an optical microscope and the results have been discussed in Chapter 4.1. 

3.1.2. Bone material 

The artificial bone material that was used for friction tests was a composite of 

epoxy resin reinforced with glass fibers, as it had mechanical properties most closely 

resembling cortical bone. The artificial bone material was supplied by Sawbones. The 

composite was prepared for thr friction test by cutting it into a cylinder which had a 

diameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The composite samples were then glued to 

solid steel cylinders that had been prepared to fit into the sample holders of the friction test 

equipment. Figure 3.2 shows a prepared artificial bone sample and the placement of the 

samples in the friction testing machine.

3.2. Characterization Techniques 

The prepared tantalum samples were characterized by various techniques. The 

surface of the samples was inspected under an optical microscope and images were 

captured with a camera attached to the microscope (Canon A620). 

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (Zeiss Merlin Gemini 2) was 

used to observe the morphology of the sample surfaces in order to compare the textured 

surfaces with polished and etched surfaces, to measure the pore size of nano pores formed 

on the surface of samples anodized at different potentials and to determine the uniformity 

of nano-texturing obtained on the sample surface after anodization treatment.  

X-ray Diffraction (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) was used to analyze the 

crystallographic structure of the etched and anodized tantalum samples. Bragg-Brentano 

X-ray diffraction was performed in conventional (?-2?) mode (scan range 20? &amp;lt;2? &amp;lt;85?, 

step size 2?= 0.04?, scan step time 3 seconds and Cu K?1 radiations (? = 1.54060 Å). 

Hardness measurements were made by using the Vickers hardness method 

(Struess Duramin) in order to determine change in hardness due to developed of oxide 

layer of different thickness. Hardness tests were performed with a diamond shaped 

indenter at two different, 25 and 100 g.  

The surface roughness of tantalum samples was measured using a 3-D 

profilometry (alicona INFINITE FOCUS) in order to determine changes in the surface 

roughness after etching and anodization treatment. The roughness measurements were also 

performed on samples that have been kept in saliva at 37 ?C for three days. 

The tribological characterization was done by using a friction coefficient 

measurement device which was originally developed in CEMUC. An image of the setup 

and the schematics are shown in Figure 3.2. The setup was operated by a standard tensile 

testing machine with electronic control of cross-head motion [54].

Figure 3.3. (a)The friction coefficient measurement setup and (b) schematics of the friction test 

 

As the schematics in Figure 3.3 show, the tantalum sample was placed in the 

sample holder in the center and the cortical bone mimicking composite, epoxy resin 

reinforced with glass fiber, was fixed into holders located on opposite side of the sample, 

and brought into contact with the tantalum metal surface. The so called ‘sandwich’ was 

clamped together firmly and a normal force (F) of 250 N was applied. In all experiments 

the samples were displaced at a contant speed of 1 mm/min in the vertical direction. The 

resulting force vs. displacement relationship was plotted. The experiment was stopped 

when the plot achieved steady state. The plot was used to obtain three parameters: contact 

rigidity, static friction force and dynamic friction force . The slope of the initial linear part 

of the plot represented the rigidity of the interfacial contact, the maximum force 

represented the force required to initiate sliding. This force is used to calculate the static 

friction coefficient which will be discussed in the chapter: results and discussion. After the 

maximum force was reached the plot showed a decrease in force, until a constant force is 

reached. This was represented by a steady state on the plot. The constant force represented 

the dynamic force i.e. the amount of force required to slide the sample after the sample 

surface had overcome the static friction. This parameter was used to calculate the dynamic 

friction coefficient. These three parameters were compared for samples treated at different 

conditions in order to obtain information regarding their friction properties. The friction 

tests were conducted at room temperature in both dry and wet conditions. For the wet 

condition, the samples were immersed in artificial saliva and placed in an isothermal bath 

which was kept at a constant temperature of 37 ?C. The samples were kept in artificial 

saliva for three days in order to analyze the ageing effect of saliva on the friction results.

The artificial saliva solution used in the experiments was prepared by using the 

guidelines given in a publication by Darvell [57].  Prior to placing the samples in saliva, 

wetting contact angle measurements were made to determine the change in wettability of  

tantalum surface after surface treatment. Contact angle measurements were made with the 

instrument dataphysics Contact Angle System OCA. The droplet volume was 9 µl and the 

liquid used for comparison was water AS. Three measurements were taken for each sample 

in order to ensure repeatability of results.  

Wear marks formed at the sliding contact region on the sample surfaces, during 

friction tests, were observed under an optical microscope in order to analyze and compare 

degree of wear caused by sliding on the different treated tantalum surfaces.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

4.1. Surface Imaging (Optical Microscopy) 

After the Ta samples were prepared, their surfaces were analyzed under an 

optical microscope (LEICA DM4000) . Images of the Ta surfaces, captured by the camera 

connected to the microscope (LEICA MC120 HD) are shown in Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1(a) shows that the polished sample surface was preferablly oriented 

in one direction but other than than it was featureless and smooth. Figure 4.1(b) shows the 

effect of anodization after mechanical polishing. The surface showed a few features that 

looked like micro pits. These could have occured due to non uniform anodic attack by 

strong acidic electrolyte that occurred on the deformed polished surface. The oxide layer 

may have been etched more strongly in some parts than others. Figure 4.1(c) shows the Ta 

sample that was etched in a concentrated solution of HNO3:HF (1:1). The surface shows 

micro pits formed due to etching. The micro pits were, on an average, less than 25 µm in 

size.  Anodization treatment at a potential of 15 and 25 V, after etching, caused a reduction 

of the micro-pits and smoothened out the surface more, as can be observed in Figure 4.1(d) 

&amp;amp; (e). Anodization at 50 V led to the development of a thicker oxide film which exhibited

the characteristic grey-ish coloring (Figure 4.1 (f)) that usually develops when Ta2O5 is 

formed at  50 V [56]. 

Surface morphology was examined at higher magnifications to obtain nano 

features, using SEM. The results are presented in Chapter 4.2. 

4.2. Surface Morphology 

The SEM images given in Figure 4.2 show the surface of tantalum samples 

treated at different conditions. Figure 4.2 (a) shows the tantalum surface of polished and of 

polished and etched surfaces at 50,000 X magnification. In both cases texturing at the nano 

level was not observed. The figure shows that the surface is featureless in the un-anodized 

sample surfaces. The surface of the tantalum sample which was polished and anodized at a 

potential of 15V shows ordered porosity on the surface, with the average pore size of 25 

nm. The supplied tantalum sheets had poor surface quality and surface preparation by 

mechanical polishing did not seem adequate as evident from the uneven surface in the 

image, Figure 4.2 (b).  In order to overcome this problem and improve the surface 

condition, etching was also performed prior to anodization. Figure 4.2 (c) shows the SEM 

image of the tantalum sample etched and anodized at 15V. The surface shows highly 

ordered nano-porosity with an average pore size of 25 nm. The difference in the etched 

surface and the un-etched surface can be observed from the images. Etching the sample 

successfully decreased the irregularities on the surface and improved surface quality. 

Figure 4.2 (d) shows the surface of sample etched and anodized at a potential of 25 V. The 

increases in pore size can be observed from the image. This treatment resulted in an 

average pore size of 45 nm.  

Figure 4.2 (e) shows the surface of the sample etched and anodized at a 

potential of 50 V. The high voltage resulted in an increase in Ta2O5 oxide layer thickness. 

The growth of the oxide layer was not uniform, as evident from the irregular topography of 

the surface from Figure 4.2 (f). The pore size increased and the shape of the pores became 

irregular. The average pore size achieved after this treatment was 65 nm.  

EDS (Energy-dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy) analysis was also performed in 

order to obtain information about elements present on the anodized surfaces. The EDS 

result, presented in Annex A, shows that the only elements present on the surface of the

anodized samples were tantalum and oxygen. SEM images obtained at magnification of 

200000X are given in Annex B.

4.3. Crystal Structure 

The X-ray diffraction patterns obtained for tantalum samples treated at 

different conditions are shown in Figure 4.3. All the samples, with the exception of the 

samples anodized at 50 V, exhibit diffraction peak positions that are associated with BCC 

structured alpha phase Tantalum metal (ICDD card no: 00-004-0788). However, the xrd 

patterns of the etched and anodized samples showed a difference in peak intensities. 

The XRD pattern associated with the polished Ta sample (Figure 4.3(a)) was in 

agreement with the reference xrd pattern (ICDD card no: 00-004-0788). However, the 

XRD pattern of the sample that was anodized at a potential of 15 V and the etched Ta 

sample (Figure 4.3(b)&amp;amp;(c)) showed a significant decrease in intensity of the peak 

associated with (110) plane and an increase in the intensity of the peaks associated with the 

(200) and (211) planes. A possible explanation for this is preferential etching of the (110) 

plane which caused its intensity to decrease and since the other planes were now present in

larger quantity in the xrd analysis region, their xrd intensities became higher. The 

phenomena of differential etching has been observed before and it is caused due to a 

difference in the packing density and orientation of different planes [58]. The electrolyte 

composition used for this anodization process was used before in a research study and the 

phenomenon of differential etching as a function of crystallographic orientation of 

tantalum grains was reported [59]. 

Performing the anodization process after etching seemed to have led to 

preferential etching of the (110) and (200) planes, as indicated from the decrease in their 

respective intensities observed from Figure 4.3(d). Furthermore, increasing the anodization 

voltage caused an overall decrease in the intensity of the peaks associated with ?-Ta as 

deduced from Figure 4.3 (e). This is a result of a greater contribution by the Ta2O5 film as 

its thickness increased. This oxide film is generally known to be amorphous [60] [61]. The 

increase in oxide film thickness occurred due to anodization at a higher potential.  Hence, 

the distance between the xrd rays and the ?-Ta surface increased, causing most of the x-

rays to be absorbed by the amorphous oxide layer, leading to a decrease in ?-Ta peaks 

intensities. The XRD pattern associated with the sample anodized at 50V did not have the 

peaks associated with ?-Ta, which indicates a lack of long range crystallinity. Hence, it 

could be deduced that the thickness of the oxide layer had increased to the point that the 

XRD pattern observed is predominantly contributed by the Ta2O5 film.

4.4. Hardness 

Table 4.1 shows Vickers hardness measurements, of Ta samples, obtained at 

two different indenter loads. The hardness value of polished sample, measured using the 

smaller indentation load, was 224 HV. However when a higher load was used, the hardness 

value measured was smaller and closer to the values obtained for all the other samples. The 

reason for a higher hardness obtained at lower indentation load is that mechanical 

polishing may have led to surface hardening due to the plastic deformations that occurred 

on the surface during the treatment. When higher indentation load of 100 g was used, the 

indentation depth increased and crossed through the hardened surface. Hence the hardness 

value measured at higher indentation load was of the un-deformed Ta surface.  

All other Ta samples, with the exception of the one anodized at 50 V, showed 

similar hardness values at both high and low indentation loads. The oxide layer on samples 

anodized at 15 and 25 V was penetrated by the indenter and the final hardness 

measurement was of the Ta metal. Hence, the values of hardness were similar. The sample 

that was anodized at 50 V showed a lower hardness at indentation load of 25 g. This 

sample developed a higher thickness of oxide layer and the indenter was not able to 

penetrate this film completely. Hence the hardness measurement also had a major 

contribution from this amorphous oxide film which had a lower hardness than Ta metal. 

However, the hardness value increased to match the values obtained from other samples 

when a higher indentation load of 100 g was used. This means that the oxide layer had 

been penetrated and the hardness value obtained was from Ta metal. This information can 

be used to conclude that the oxide layer thickness has an effect on the surface hardness of 

the samples and this could possibly affect their tribological behavior.

4.5. Wetting behavior 

Wetting contact angle measurements on Ta surfaces were made by using 

artificial saliva as wetting fluid. Table 4.2 shows the average contact angle measurements 

obtained for the samples. The measurements were very similar to each other with very 

small deviations. It could be deduced that the nano texturing had not caused a significant 

change in the wettability of Ta surfaces when saliva was used as liquid.  

However possible experimentation could be performed in the future, to test the 

time dependent wettability of the nano textured surfaces.

4.6. Surface Roughness 

The results of 3-D profilometry performed on Ta samples treated at different 

conditions are presented in Table 4.3. Roughness results were obtained in both dry 

conditions and after immersion in saliva.  

4.6.1. Surface roughness in dry condition 

The polished untreated sample had the lowest surface roughness compared to 

the other samples, which was expected since its surface had not undergone any surface 

texturing treatment. The Rz surface roughness values for this sample were very small as 

can be seen from Table 4.3. The Ta sample that was anodized after polishing, without 

etching treatment, had a higher surface roughness than the polished sample. Even though 

no etching treatment had been performed on the surface, the anodization process itself 

could be called an electrochemical etching process. Mechanical polishing is achieved by 

plastic deformation which changes the crystal structure on the surface more or less 

intensively by disturbing the orientation. The quality of surface is poorer compared to a 

chemically polished surface. Anodization is sensitive to the nature of the surface. The

uneven polished layers are etched off more easily than the undisturbed structure beneath 

them. This uneven etching results in an increase in surface roughness. The increase in Rz 

value indicated that this surface had more peaks and valleys than the polished sample. 

However, this electrochemical treatment seemed to be less aggressive than chemical 

etching, as indicated from the Rz value of this sample, which were smaller compared to the 

chemically etched sample. 

The chemically etched Ta sample had a significantly higher surface roughness 

compared to the polished surface and polished &amp;amp; anodized surface. Etching in a strong acid 

solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid resulted in micro pitting on the surface and 

consequently, in an increase in surface roughness. 

The samples that were polished, etched and anodized at 15 V had a higher 

surface roughness than the polished and anodized sample at the same potential. The acid 

etching treatment improved the quality of the surface by removing scratches and 

irregularities. But it introduced micropits on the surface and anodization treatment at a low 

voltage of 15 V did not significantly affect the micro scale surface roughness of the etched 

sample. However, at higher anodization potentials smaller Rz value was obtained, of 

samples anodized at 25. This could be due to the increase in the intensity of 

electrochemical attack which would have an increased smoothening effect and lead to a 

decrease in surface roughness. An abnormally small Rz value was obtained at 50 V. 

4.6.2. Surface roughness after immersion in saliva 

The profilometry measurements of Ta samples that had been kept in artificial 

saliva showed a difference in surface roughness values compared to the data obtained in 

dry conditions. It would be hard to determine what changes occurred due to immersion in 

saliva that caused the change in surface roughness. It requires further research and 

experimentation.

All the plots, with the exception of the one for polished Ta, exhibited the 

characteristics of a typical static friction plot. The maximum static friction force, as well as 

the decrease in force to a constant steady state, could clearly be observed on the plots.

sides. Consequently the friction results were contributed by two interfaces of Ta 

sample/artificial bone material. In order to obtain the result from a single interface the 

results simply needed to be divided by two. The stiffness of the Ta surface/artificial bone 

contact, static friction force and dynamic force values obtained from each plot were 

divided by 2. The results are presented in Table 4.4.

The theoretical applied normal load in all experiments was 250 N and it was 

fixed by using the electronic control connected to the load cell. Linear calibration of the 

load cell was performed, in order to measure the real applied load. The calculated 

sensitivity of the load cell was 0.67 N/mV and consequently the real applied normal load 

was 167.63 N. This was the value of normal load used in Equation 1. The static and 

dynamic friction coefficient data  is given in Table 4.5.

4.7.1. Static Friction Behavior 

The static friction coefficient holds the most relevance in the study of the 

tribological behavior of the textured Ta surface as a dental implant material, as it is directly 

related to mechanical interlocking efficiency. The dental implant should be able to form a 

good mechanically interlocking at the contact region with bone and micro motion should 

be minimized, the static friction coefficient is desired to be high. Hence this friction 

parameter was given the most focus in the discussion of the tribological results.

has the most dominant effect on the friction properties of textured Ta surfaces. Figure 4.5 

shows the surface roughness and static friction coefficient of Ta samples treated at 

different conditions.  

The polished sample showed a very small static friction force peak and the 

static friction force was smaller than the dynamic friction force (Figure 4.4 (a)). This 

occurred due to the low Rz value associated with this sample (Table 4.3) i.e. the mean peak 

to valley height was small. Hence it could be deduced that the polished sample surface 

failed to mechanically interlock effectively with the artificial bone material and slippage 

occurred readily. Hence, in Figure 4.5 it can be seen that the surface roughness value is the 

lowest, but the static friction coefficient (µs) value is higher than that of the sample 

anodized at 50 V. Even though the value of static friction coefficient was higher, the static 

friction regime was very small. Therefore the polished sample could be called an abnormal 

friction result. 

The sample that was mechanically polished and anodized at 15 V had a static 

friction coefficient value of 0.4 (Table 4.5). This could be correlated to the Rz value of 

7.22 µm (Table 4.3) which means that the surface had asperities that formed mechanical 

interlocking effectively with the glass fiber epoxy surface. This high surface roughness 

may have developed due to the non uniform growth of tantalum oxide that occurred as a 

result of non uniform electrochemical etching during anodization. The surface may have 

developed heterogeneities such as hardness, surface shear strength etc. which contributed 

to its friction behavior. The tantalum sheets that were supplied had poor surface quality. 

The only treatment done on this sample that was polished and anodized at 15 V, for 

improving the surface quality was mechanical polishing, hence some defects may have 

remained on the surface and these could have contributed to the static friction.  

The change in static friction coefficient of the etched and anodized samples 

was similar, in trend, to change in their surface roughness (Figure 4.5). The chemically 

etched sample surface had a smaller mean peak to valley height of roughness profile (Rz) 

than the sample that was etched and anodized at 15 V. It also showed a smaller coefficient 

of friction. The anodized sample also had a higher contact rigidity compared to the etched 

sample (Table 4.4). This could have been due to the development of the amorphous 

tantalum oxide layer. This oxide layer would exhibit different surface properties than the 

Ta surface. A previous research study showed that the hardness and elastic modulus of 

tantalum oxide layer varied with its thickness and thin oxide layers are capable of 

withstanding large elastic deformations without failure [62].

The sample anodized at 25 V showed even higher rigidity. Anodization at 25 V 

resulted in a greater film thickness and the amorphous film showed greater elasticity at the 

contact region. Hence it could be deduced that the oxide film thickness of this sample was 

within the limit of high elasticity defined in the research work mentioned in the previous 

paragraph [62]. However, it showed a lower static friction coefficient than the etched 

sample and the sample anodized at a lower potential of 15 V. This decrease in the static 

friction was attributed to the low surface roughness of this sample. The Rz value of this 

sample was significantly smaller compared to the etched and the anodized samples; hence 

it may have formed poorer mechanical interlocking. Despite the significant difference in 

the surface roughness, the static friction of this sample was not significantly smaller than 

the one anodized at 15 V or the chemically etched sample. This may have been because of 

the higher rigidity at contact region caused due to the good elasticity of the film, which 

hindered initiation of slippage.  It has been observed that at increasing oxide film thickness 

(&gt;100 nm), this elastic behavior decreases and more plastic strain is observed [62].  From 

Table 4.4, comparing the etched and anodized samples it can be seen that contact rigidity 

increased i.e. the etched sample had the lowest contact rigidity, which increased for the 

sample anodized at 15 V and the highest was achieved for the sample anodized at 25 V. 

However, contact rigidity decreased for the sample that was anodized at 50 V. The Rz 

value of this sample was also the lowest, compared to the other anodized samples. 

Consequently, this sample exhibited the lowest static friction coefficient.  This sample had 

the highest oxide film thickness. From the SEM image in Figure 4.2 (e) it was observed 

that the oxide layer was not homogenously formed. The surface was non uniform and the 

pores were larger and irregular. This surface also exhibited lower hardness value. These 

factors may have contributed towards the sample’s poor friction performance compared to 

the other anodized samples. 

The surface roughness of the different Ta sample surfaces seemed to be the 

dominant factor in determining their static friction behavior. However, other contributions 

such as surface adhesion and the effect of the surface properties of oxide layer were not 

studied. 

4.7.2. Dynamic Friction Behavior

important to have knowledge about the dynamic friction behavior as it helps in 

understanding the micro motion behavior of the implants and also their failure 

mechanisms. 

The polished sample showed the highest dynamic friction coefficient compared 

to the treated samples. This could be explained in terms of the surface polishing which led 

to an increase in surface flatness. This was supported by the very small Rz surface 

roughness value of polished sample (Table 4.3), which indicated a very flat surface. This 

led to an increase in the contact area between Ta and the glass fiber epoxy composite. A 

higher sliding force was required to drag the Ta surface over the composite’s surface. 

However, the contact rigidity was the smallest, compared to other samples (Table 4.4). 

Despite the high dynamic friction coefficient, the absence of any effective static contact 

and consequently the failure of the un-textured sample to form an effective mechanically 

interlocking with artificial bone and hence resulted in small contact rigidity.  

Figure 4.6 shows the comparison of static and dynamic friction coefficients of 

the etched and the anodized samples. The dynamic friction coefficient was smaller than the 

static friction coefficient in all cases. This is a typical friction behavior that surfaces 

exhibit. In the initial stage of sliding, the surface asperities undergo deformation and wear 

i.e. the running-in effect. Sliding could be described as a polishing phenomenon as it leads 

to surface smoothening resulting from wear. The Ta sample surfaces were worn due to 

sliding contact with glass fiber epoxy composite and the wear marks were observable with 

the naked eye.  

The Ta surface anodized at 15 V after mechanical polishing had a lower 

dynamic friction coefficient than the surface anodized at the same potential after etch 

treatment. This could be related to the quality of oxide film that formed on both surfaces. 

The anodized Ta surface may have worn off more easily due to the poor adherence of the 

oxide film to the metal surface. Scratch tests could provide a more detailed insight into this 

argument but this would have to be left for future work due to the shortage of time. 

However this argument makes sense as the wear track of this sample showed a shinier 

surface than the etched sample, hence a higher degree of wear (Chapter 4.8).  

The samples anodized at higher potentials had lower dynamic friction 

coefficients compared to the samples anodized at 15 V. These thicker oxide layers maye 

have been more easily worn away. The surface shear strength may have changed as surface 

texturing occurred at higher potential. A greater intensity of electrochemical attack on the

surface wear to occur at lower dynamic friction forces.

4.7.3. Static Friction Behavior in Artificial Saliva (Dry vs. Wet) 

Past research has shown that artificial saliva has shown conflicting results. In 

some cases it has caused a decrease in static friction while in other cases it led to an 

increase in static friction. Static friction tests performed on orthodontic wires in a similar 

manner as the one performed in this research led to varying results.  Kusy et al. [63] for 

example, concluded that artificial saliva was an inadequate replacement for human saliva 

and hence any experiments related to it as incorrect. Andreasen and Quevedo [64] 

suggested that the saliva does not play a significant role, while Read-Ward et al. [65] 

concluded that the presence of human saliva had an inconsistent effect on static friction 

and sliding mechanics. Furthermore, Baker et al. [66] reported that saliva had a lubricating 

effect whereas Stannard et al. [67] reported that saliva increased friction. Therefore a 

common effect of artificial saliva on friction properties has not been reported as there have 

been conflicted reports of the adhesive and lubricating effect of saliva. In the previous 

reports the artificial saliva was sprayed onto the sample during the test to maintain constant 

wetting condition. In this thesis, the effect of artificial saliva was studied by immersing the 

samples in artificial saliva solution for three days at a constant temperature of 37 ?C, after 

which the samples were removed and friction tests were performed. The hypothesis that 

was being tested in this research was that saliva acts as a lubricant and the lubricating 

effect should improve in the nano textured samples as the nano pores could act as saliva

Figure 4.7. Friction graphs of Ta samples in dry and wet conditions (P=Polished, E=Etched, 

An=Anodized) 

 

The figure shows that the friction graph of the polished sample did not exhibit 

any static friction region and the graph itself did not represent typical friction behavior. 

The friction plot of etched sample in wet condition showed that the static and dynamic 

friction force were lower compared to dry condition. The samples anodized at 15 V 

showed that the dynamic friction increased in wet condition, but the static friction 

decreased. But the samples anodized at 25 V and 50 V showed that both the static and 

dynamic friction force increased. The static friction coefficient data of Ta samples obtained 

in dry and wet conditions is compiled in Table 4.6.

Table 4.6 shows that the sample polished and anodized at 15 V, the etched 

sample and the sample that was anodized at 15 V after etching showed a decrease in static 

friction coefficient. However, the sample that was anodized at 25 V, after polishing and 

etching, showed a significant increase in static fricition coefficient in wet condition. A 

similar result was seen for the case of Ta sample anodized at 50 V. It is hard to provide a 

specific reason for this difference as there could be various factors that may have 

contributed to this significant increase in static friction coefficient. It could have been that 

chemical deposits from the saliva solution, such as NaCl, formed more readily on these 

surfaces and raised the friction coefficient. More testing is required to reach a solid 

conclusion.  

4.7.4. Dynamic friction behavior in dry vs. wet conditions 

The anodized Ta samples behaved quite differently from static conditions when 

sliding initiated.  The Table 4.7 provides the compiled data of dynamic friction 

coefficients, of Ta samples, obtained in dry and wet conditions. The polished and etched 

samples had lower dynamic friction coefficients in wet condition. However the anodized 

samples showed an increase in dynamic friction. Table 4.7 shows that the friction plots of 

samples anodized at 15 V achieved steady state regime at higher forces, even though the 

static friction force was slightly lower. The samples anodized at 25 V and 50 V had a 

significant increase in dynamic friction. It is also interesting to note that the friction 

coefficient of sample anodized at 50V was still lower than the other etched and anodized 

samples. This could be attributed to the non uniform oxide layer that formed on the surface 

at this potential and the decreased hardness of the surface due to increased oxide thickness.

Dynamic friction behavior did not show dependence on the Rz surface 

roughness. Hence, in discussing the conclusion of the friction analysis the static friction 

behavior was given focus.

4.7.5. Static friction vs. Surface roughness 

After discussing the static and dynamic friction behavior of Ta samples treated 

at different conditions, a clear relationship between the surface roughness and static 

friction behavior needed to be established in order to test the hypothesis that surface 

roughness plays a dominant role in determining the static friction behavior of Ta surface. 

Hence a scatter graph of static friction coefficient vs surface roughness (Rz) of Ta surfaces, 

in both dry and wet conditions, was plotted and a line of best fit was used to obtain the 

trend in the scatter of points (Figure 4.8). Majority of the data points are evenly distributed 

about the trend line and majority of the data points lay close to the line, which shows that 

the static friction coefficient is influenced by surface roughness.  

Hence from this research study it could be deduced that the surface roughness 

affects the static friction behavior of textured Ta surfaces. It is, however, important to state 

that this was a preliminary research study that was conducted to test a hypothesis and the 

results showed promising potential if this research study is extended and more 

experimental testing and characterization is performed.

4.8. Wear analysis 

When the static friction at the Ta/glass fiber epoxy contact region was 

overcome, the Ta sample started to slide. The Ta samples exhibited wear at the sliding 

contact region. The wear regions were observed under an optical microscope and the 

degree of wear on the surface of different samples was compared.  

4.8.1. Dry condition 

The optical microcope images showed that the anodized Ta surfaces exhibited different 

degree of wear compared to the untreated Ta surfaces. Figure 4.9 (a) shows the surface of 

the polished Ta sample. The image shows a circle of contrast in the middle, which is the 

sliding contact region. Sliding did not seem to have caused significant degree of wear on 

the polished Ta surface. Figure 4.9 (b) shows the surface of Ta sample anodized at 15 V 

after mechanical polishing. The sliding contact region is much more visible and brighter in 

this image. This surface was scratched and worn to a higher degree compared to the 

polished Ta surface.   

Figure 4.9 (c) shows the surface of chemically etched Ta sample. The central circular 

region of sliding contact region can be observed in the image. This region showed that 

sliding on the etched Ta surface had to caused high degree of wear. The area surrounding 

the sliding region shows bright spots on the etched surface. Etching usually occurs at

different rates at grains of different orientations, grain boundaries and defects. It also leads 

to some micro pitting on the metal surface. The micro pits on etched Ta surface were 

observed in Figure 4.1 (c). Thus etched metal surface usually shows bright and dark 

contrast regions. The image in Figure 4.9(c) was taken at low magnification, hence the 

bright regions are only visible as bright spots on the surface.  

Figure 4.9(d) &amp;amp; (e) show that the sliding contact region in surfaces anodized at 15 and 25 

V respectively, had a brighter sliding contact region compared to etched surface. The 

sliding region on these surfaces show higher degree of scratching and wear compared to 

etched Ta surface. The anodized samples had a nano-textured Ta2O5 surface. In Chapter 

4.3 (Crystal structure)  it had been discussed that the oxide layer was amorphous (Figure 

4.3). Hence the surface properties of the anodized samples would be expected to be 

different. The amorphous oxide would be expected to be more brittle and have different 

shear strength than Ta metal. Due to the anodic attack, the textured surfaces would also be 

expected to have higher stresses. These and other surface properties might have made them 

more susceptible to wear than un-anodized metal surface, hence the higher degree of wear 

and scratching. The scratches are oriented in the direction of sliding 

Figure 4.9 (f) shows the surface of Ta sample anodized at 50 V. The image shows different 

colors compared to images of other samples in Figure 4.9, the bright spots appearing 

yellower and the sliding region appearing grey-green. This was caused by the characteristic 

grey-green colored oxide film that developed at 50 V (discussed previously in Chapter 4.1, 

in reference to Figure 4.1 (f)). Figure 4.9 (f) shows that the sliding contact region does not 

show a clear distinct shape. The scratches on the surface are oriented in the direction of 

sliding and the surface with the bright yellow spots could possibly be the exposed etched 

surface after some oxide film has worn away.

4.8.2. Wet condition 

The wear marks in Figure 4.10 were formed on Ta surface that had been 

immersed in artificial saliva for three days prior to friction tests. The polished and etched 

sample showed low wear at sliding region (Figure 4.10 (a)&amp;amp;(c)), which was similar to the 

observations made on these surfaces in dry conditions (Figure 4.9 (a)&amp;amp;(c)). Ta sample, that 

was anodized after mechanical polishing, showed a bright circular sliding region. The 

surface showed considerable scratching and wear.  

The samples that were etched and anodized at 15 and 25 V (Figure 4.10 

(d)&amp;amp;(e)) also showed bright sliding regions. The scratches and wear in the region was 

easily observable. The sliding region on the sample anodized at 50 V (Figure 4.10 (f)) was 

very visible under the microscope. The oxide layer had clearly been worn away as the 

bright metal surface was exposed at the sliding region, in clear contrast to the dull grey-

green oxide surface in the surrounding regions.  

The anodized surfaces in both dry and wet conditions showed a higher degree 

of wear than un-anodized surfaces. The textured tantalum oxide clearly had surface 

properties which made it more vunerable to surface wear than Ta metal. Anodic attack 

possibly induced surface stresses. Ta samples anodized at different potentials underwent 

different intensity of chemical attack by the strong electrolyte. This could affect the degree 

of surface stresses induced on the oxide surface and the surface shear strength. Figure 4.10

(f) shows that the oxide film was worn off. Hence the adhesion of the oxide films formed 

at different anodic potential may have also differed.   

The wear marks obtained in wet condition were different in shape and size. But 

this difference in wear mark dimensions was not relevant. The variation in dimensions of 

sliding region was expected, as  Ta sample alignment during the test could vary for each 

test and the test was stopped when the friction graph showed steady state regime. Hence, 

sliding time was not a constant. Subsequently the dimensions of the sliding contact region 

were different.

CONCLUSIONS  
 

In this thesis the tribological properties of nano textured tantalum were studied. 

Anodization method was used to introduce highly ordered nano pores on tantalum surface. 

Three different potentials, 15, 25 and 50 V,  were used in anodization in order to obtain 

three diferent pore diameters on the nano dimpled surface. Three different average pore 

sizes were obtained at different potentials, SEM images showed that highly ordered nano 

texturing had been achieved by the electrochemical process.  

XRD patterns of the treated Ta samples showed that the tantalum oxide film 

was amorphous and preferential etching had occured on the treated surfaces. The hardness 

results showed that the amorphous oxide layer is softer than the metal and the hardness 

tends to change with oxide thickness as effect of the metal on the overall hardness 

decreases.Wetting contact angle measurements showed that there was no significant 

change in the wetting behavior of treated and untreated Ta surfaces.  

3-d profilometry measurements showed that anodization influenced the micro-

surface roughness (Rz).The static friction coefficient showed an almost linear dependancy 

on the micro surface roughness. Dynamic friction coefficient did not show a clear 

relationship to surface roughness. The anodized Ta surfaces had nano textured amorphous 

oxide layer and showed a higher degree of wear than the un-anodized Ta surfaces.  

It can be concluded that nano texturing by  anodization treatment caused the 

surface roughness to change on the micron level. The surface roughness was a major 

contributor to the static friction behavior of the untreated and treated Ta surfaces. Hence, 

when deciding the optimum nano texture, by anodization, for biological performane of Ta 

dental implant it is also important to assess its friction behavior, as  it plays an important 

role in defining the performance of the dental implant when it is inserted into the jaw and 

brought into contact with bone.

FUTURE WORK 
 

 

1. The friction tests on nano textured Ta surfaces will be performed with real 

bone material to obtain a more realistic result of the friction behavior of the 

textured Ta surfaces as dental implants. 

 

2. Study the history of the materials before sample preparation 

 

3. The Ta surfaces will be anodized at more magnitudes of voltage in order to 

achieve a wider range of pore size on the textured surface. This could 

provide more information and data regarding the relationship between 

surface roughness and friction behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces. 

 

4. Scratch tests will performed to study the adhesion of oxide film formed at 

different voltages during anodization, as this could provide more 

information regarding the wear behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces. 

 

5. The experiments will be repeated for higher number of times to obtain a 

more statistically improved data. 

 

6. The time dependent wetting behavior of nano textured Ta surfaces, with 

artificial saliva, will be studied. 

 

7. The fretting behavior of the nano textured Ta surfaces will be studied.
