Activity and habitat use of two species of stingrays
(Myliobatiformes: Potamotrygonidae) in the upper Paraná River basin,

Southeastern Brazil

Domingos Garrone Neto1 and Virgínia Sanches Uieda2

The life history of freshwater stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) under natural conditions has been poorly documented. In this
study, we investigated the period of activity and the habitat use of two species of the genus Potamotrygon in the upper
Paraná River basin, Southeastern Brazil. Potamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro are similar to each other as far as the
analyzed behavior is concerned. Individuals of both species segregate according to their size, and in function of the depth
and period of the day. Younger individuals inhabit mostly sandy beaches and places that are no deeper than four meters
throughout the whole day. Bigger stingrays realize bathymetric migrations, alternating their position between places
deeper than eight meters during the day, and shallow areas at night. Individuals of intermediate size inhabit transition
environments that have greater habitat diversity. Both species presented mostly nocturnal habits, especially regarding
their feeding behavior. The behavioral patterns observed seem to go through ontogenetic variations and probably change
throughout the year, between dry and wet seasons.

Informações sobre o modo de vida das raias de água doce (Potamotrygonidae) sob condições naturais são escassas. Neste
trabalho, estudamos o período de atividade e as formas de uso do habitat de duas espécies do gênero Potamotrygon na
bacia do alto rio Paraná, no Sudeste do Brasil. Potamotrygon falkneri e P. motoro apresentaram comportamento muito
semelhante, com nítida segregação espacial dos indivíduos em função do seu tamanho, da profundidade e do período do
dia. Juvenis estiveram associados a praias arenosas e locais com profundidades abaixo de quatro metros ao longo de todo
o dia. Raias de grande porte realizaram migrações batimétricas, alternando sua posição entre locais com profundidade
superior a oito metros durante o dia e áreas mais rasas à noite. Indivíduos com tamanho intermediário ocuparam ambientes
de transição, com maior heterogeneidade ambiental. Ambas as espécies apresentaram atividade, especialmente alimentar,
predominantemente noturna. Os padrões comportamentais estudados parecem sofrer variações ontogenéticas e é provável
que se alterem ao longo do ano, entre períodos de seca e cheia.

Introduction

Studies on patterns of movement, spatial distribution,
activity and habitat use of fishes, associated with the
description of the characteristics of the occupied areas, have
been used as central topics of ecological research, including
resources sharing, organization of communities,
ecomorphology, and optimum foraging (Anderson et al., 1989;

Rincón, 1999). Knowledge of fishes’ way of life in nature and
their preference for particular types of environments have
also been used to identify and protect specific habitats and
to support actions of management and conservation of
species in different parts of the world (Steimle &amp;amp; Zetlin, 2000;
Simpfendorfer &amp;amp; Heupel, 2004; Aguiar et al., 2009).

In Brazil, research into the behavior of fish in the natural
environment is recent but has been steadily growing from

year to year, normally focusing on species of teleostean
fish (Sazima, 1986; Casatti &amp;amp; Castro, 1998; Sabino, 1999;
Teresa et al., 2011). Information of this kind is scarce when
dealing with elasmobranchs, particularly with stingrays of
the family Potamotrygonidae (Castex, 1963; Achenbach &amp;amp;
Achenbach, 1976; Rosa, 1985). Only in recent years, the
surveys of Brazilian fish species, and particularly of
freshwater stingrays, were intensified. In the last years, the
potamotrygonids have rekindled the interest of researchers,
enabling the generation of data on the biology, ecology,
taxonomy, and toxicology of some species (see Garrone Neto
&amp;amp; Haddad Jr., 2010; Rosa et al., 2010; Carvalho &amp;amp; Lovejoy,
2011 and references therein).

However, the life history of the family Potamotrygonidae
under natural conditions has been poorly studied (Garrone
Neto &amp;amp; Sazima, 2009a, b), since the majority of existing data
are based on indirect observations, with this methodology’s
inherent limitations. In this sense, we have aimed to present
information on patterns of activity and forms of habitat use
by two co-occurring species of potamotrygonids, thereby
contributing to the better understanding of the way of life
of these animals in their natural environment.

Material and Methods

Study area. The present study was carried out in the upper
course of the Paraná River, Southeastern Brazil, between
2005 and 2008. The investigations were concentrated in the
municipalities of Castilho, SP and Três Lagoas, MS (about
20°47’S 51°37’W), on the border of the states of São Paulo
and Mato Grosso do Sul. Additional information was
obtained from expeditions conducted in the municipality of
Panorama, SP (21°22’S 51°54’W), in the region comprising
the lower reaches of the Tietê (20°40’S 51°25’W) and
Paranapanema (22°39’S 53°05’W) rivers, and in the Ilha
Grande National Park (24°00’S 54°07’W). These expeditions
comprised a stretch of approximately 350 kilometers which
are under the influence of two hydroelectric dams:
Engenheiro Sérgio Motta (Porto Primavera) and Engenheiro
Souza Dias (Jupiá) (Fig. 1).

According to the Köppen-Geiger classification (Peel et
al., 2007), the region has a Cfa or humid sub-tropical climate,
comprising two clearly defined seasons: one hot and rainy,
which runs from the beginning of November through April,
and the other dry and cooler, beginning in May and ending
around October. In the dry period, when the underwater
observations were concentrated, the water from the rivers
and marginal lakes has excellent transparency, which may
reach depths of 6 to 8 meters, mainly in October.

The region comprising the upper Paraná River has a long
history of human occupation, with the deployment of large
hydroelectric projects and few locations which have
maintained the original environmental characteristics (e. g.
rapids and waterfalls). The substrate and the composition of
the banks range from muddy bottom with pasture present at
the water’s edge, to sandy substrate with the presence of

rocks, aquatic macrophytes and riparian vegetation. In order
to represent a large number of these features, different
locations for observational studies were explored, with depths
ranging from 0.5 to 18 meters.

Potamotrygonids species in the studied area. Of the three
species of stingrays recorded in the upper Paraná River
basin (Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Haddad Jr., 2010), two were selected
for this study: Potamotrygon falkneri Castex &amp;amp; Maciel, 1963
and P. motoro (Müller &amp;amp; Henle, 1841) (Fig. 2). Potamotrygon
falkneri is endemic to the Paraná-Paraguay River basin and
its specific identity is well corroborated (Rosa, 1985; Silva
&amp;amp; Carvalho, 2011). Potamotrygon motoro integrate a set of
morphotypes widely distributed through the rivers of South
America and at least one new form was identified in the
Paraná River basin, requiring further investigation for its
determination (Rosa, 1985; Loboda, 2010). Therefore, two
specimens of each studied species were collected and stored
in the fish collection of the Museu de Zoologia Prof. Dr.
Adão José Cardoso - ZUEC/UNICAMP (voucher-specimens:
ZUEC 6331 - P. falkneri, and ZUEC 6332 - P. motoro), in a

way to enable future verification and the potential revision
of their identification.

Underwater observations. Data concerning activity and
habitat use were obtained during 112 hours of underwater
observations, comprised through random transects with the
use of self-contained diving technique (scuba diving) and
free diving (snorkeling) (Sabino, 1999). In order to detect
possible temporal variations, we divided the daily cycle into
three time periods: day - from the total sunrise to the
beginning of sunset; dusk - from the period in which the
sun is near to and below the horizon; night - from the total
sunset until the beginning of sunrise. Data on the water
temperature and depth of the observation sites were obtained
during the dives using mercury thermometer and a graduate
lead line, respectively, in order to verify possible correlations
of these environmental variables with the behavior of the
rays. In addition, data on the habitats occupied by the
animals at the time of the sightings were collected, aiming to
investigate the use of the different types of environments
(beach, flooded forest, stone, or grass), substrate type (sand,
muddy, or gravel), and places with presence or absence of
horizontal and/or vertical restrictions (i.e. structures used
as shelters, like rocks, trunks, and macrophyte banks).

The scuba diving totaled 15 hours (day = 08 hours;
night = 05 hours; dusk = 02 hours) and was performed in
locations where the depth of the water was between eight
and 18 meters. The free diving totaled 97 hours (day = 52
hours; night = 29 hours; dusk = 16 hours) and was carried
o u t  i n  l o c a t i o n s  w i t h  d e p t h  l e s s  t h a n  1 2  m e t e r s .
Observations were described according to a standard
protocol built for this study and recorded using digital
photography and video, and notes were made on PVC
boards, based on methodology presented by Sazima (1986)
and Sabino (1999). During the dives carried out at dusk
and at night, we used indirect lighting and lamps with red
cellophane filter in order to reduce the disturbance by the
observer (Helfman, 1992; Sabino, 1999).

Species identification (based on the coloration of the animals’
dorsum) and sex identification (based on the presence of claspers
in the males - easily observed dorsally) were done in situ during
the underwater observations, without the necessity of catching
the animals. The size of the observed individuals was estimated
using a hand net of known dimensions placed close to the
animals in a way to determine the disc width (DW, i.e. the distance
between the extremities of the stingray’s pectoral fins). A similar
method has been successfully used to estimate the disc length
of marine rays (e.g. Aguiar et al., 2009).

Fig. 2. Potamotrygon falkneri Castex &amp;amp; Maciel, 1963 (female; DW = 43 cm) (a), and P. motoro (Müller &amp;amp; Henle, 1841) (male;
DW = 32 cm) (b).

Data analysis. To ascertain potential relationship between
the observed individuals and environmental variables as
time period, depth, type of environment, substrate, and
local with presence or absent of horizontal and/or vertical
restrictions, a Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA)
was conducted using the software Statistica 7.0®. Data
about temperature were not included in this analysis, but
were used to correlate this variable to the others analyzed.
During underwater observations it was observed a similarity
among species - but a difference between individuals of
different sizes - in relation to distribution and habitat use.
In function of these observations, the FCA analysis was
applied to data grouped by size, without differentiation by
species. According to disc width (DW) and sexual maturity
(Garrone Neto, 2010), the individuals were divided into three
size classes: f1 (DW 15-25 cm), f2 (DW 26-45 cm) and f3
(DW 46-65 cm).

The FCA is a graphical procedure which aims to represent
the associations of a contingency table; therefore it does
not take absolute values into consideration, but rather the
correspondence between characters. This method analyses
the data frequency table via the chi-square distance, thereby
permitting the object of the study to be linked to different
variables.

Results

In total, 132 animals were observed, 62 of which were
identified as P. falkneri (males = 14; females = 48) and 70 as
P. motoro (males = 17; females = 51; unidentified = 02). Of
t h e s e  1 3 2  s i g h t i n g s ,  8 7  c o r r e s p o n d e d  t o  d a y t i m e
observations (65.9%), 34 at night time (25.8%), and 11 at
dusk (8.3%). From the daytime observations, 42 were related
to stationary animals (48.3%), 23 to roaming animals (26.4%),
18 foraging (20.7%), and four were buried (4.6%). At night,
24 stingrays were foraging (70.5%), five were roaming
(14.7%), four were stationary (11.8%), and one was buried
(3.0%). At dusk, eight individuals were involved in foraging
activity (73%), two were roaming (18%), one was stationary
(9%), and none was buried.

The two studied species presented very similar patterns of
number of individuals observed per size class, sex and time of
the day. They also presented very similar behavior. For both
species there was a variation in the spatial distribution of the
individuals and the ways in which they use the habitat related
to the size (disc width, DW), as shown in a schematic diagram
produced with the results of underwater observation (Fig. 3)
and in the graphic representation of FCA analysis (Fig. 4).

In the main river channel, stingrays belonging to the
smaller size class (f1) were associated with the riverbanks,
at depths between zero and four meters, in waters with about
24°C (x = 23.8ºC; sd = 0.64) and over a predominantly sandy
substrate, throughout the day cycle. For this size class, it
was common to observe intra-specific aggregations of up to
five stingrays resting, sometimes close to some kind of
shelter, particularly tree trunks. Otherwise, in marginal lakes

and in some stretches of the impoundment areas, these
small stingrays showed behavioral variation related to time
period, depth and temperature. In these lentic environments,
where the temperature of the water approached 27°C in
depths up to three meters (x = 26.5°C; sd = 0.53), the
individuals remained in deeper places during the day, in
waters of about 24ºC (x = 24.2°C; sd = 0.70) and over muddy
substrate. However, these small-sized stingrays were more
active at night and were observed approaching to shallow
banks, when the temperature of the water was about 24ºC
(x = 23.7ºC; sd = 0.48).

Intermediate-sized individuals (size class f2) were also
found in the river channel and in marginal lakes, frequently
between zero and four meters depth and temperatures near
23ºC (x = 23.3ºC; sd = 0.52), and showed greater activity during
the night. These individuals were associated to different types
of environments, which ranged from rocky banks and stony
bottom to places with low-growing riverbank vegetation,
sandy substrates, tree trunks and macrophyte banks. In this
group, many individuals were observed moving or foraging
and, in some cases (n = 07), interacting with species of
Cichlidae during their feeding activity.

Large individuals (size class f3) were observed only in the
river channel. These stingrays were usually solitary and were
rarely seen totally or partially buried in the substrate. For this
size class, the spatial distribution showed variation related to
depth and time period, with individuals occurring in deeper
locations (more than eight meters) during the day and in
shallower sites (between 3-8 meters) during the night. During
the day they were observed over muddy or sandy substrates
at the bottom of the river channel, resting in deeper waters at
temperatures around 22ºC (x = 21.6°C; sd = 0.74), sometimes
near some type of vertical restriction (e. g. shelters like rocks
and macrophyte banks). These large stingrays were more
active at night, when they forage in shallow marginal places
and temperatures near 24ºC (x = 24.2°C; sd = 0.70).

Discussion

The use of underwater observation was shown to be of
great relevance for the study of freshwater stingrays in their
natural environment, enabling the pioneering collection of
data related to their way of life. Excepting for difficulties during
the peak of the wet period (December to March), when there
is a natural tendency for river visibility to be drastically
reduced, the use of scuba and free diving techniques provided
valuable information about the periods of activity and the
ways of habitat use of P. falkneri and P. motoro, and made
possible a preliminary understanding of their spatial
distribution in lentic and lotic environments.

Both species presented very similar patterns of spatial
distribution and of ways in which they use the habitat.
Potamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro were considered
predominantly nocturnal animals, particularly regarding
feeding activity. Studies suggested that various species
of elasmobranchs are active during different periods of

t h e  d a y,  n o t a b l y  a t  n i g h t  ( A c k e r m a n  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 0 ;
Simpfendorfer &amp;amp; Heupel, 2004). In many cases, this pattern
of movement seems to be associated with different factors,
such as foraging, thermoregulation, and anti-predation
strategies (Silliman &amp;amp; Gruber, 1999; Matern et al., 2000;
Aguiar et al., 2009), or having a close relationship with
environmental factors, such as the lunar phases or tide
movements (Smith &amp;amp; Merriner, 1985; Cartamil et al., 2003;
Simpfendorfer &amp;amp; Heupel, 2004).

The behavior of P. falkneri and P. motoro showed
ontogenetic differences and a clear spatial segregation of
individuals, mainly in relation to water depth and period of
day. The spatial distribution and period of activity of the
stingrays also presented an interesting relationship with
the diet and the hunting tactics employed by P. falkneri and
P. motoro in the study area. Class f1 stingrays are mainly
insectivorous (Silva &amp;amp; Uieda, 2007) and use the hunting
tactic namely “undulate disc and stir substrate” to uncover
hidden prey in unconsolidated substrata (Garrone-Neto &amp;amp;
Sazima, 2009a), both in lentic and lotic environments. As a
result, these individuals probably prefer to inhabit the
riverbanks and shallow areas with predominantly sandy or
muddy substrate due to their feeding behavior during this
stage of maturity.

Aguiar (2005) and Aguiar et al. (2009), studying the
behavior of the ray Dasyatis americana (Dasyatidae) on an
oceanic island in Northeastern Brazil, observed that the
spatial distribution of young individuals (disc length &amp;lt;35
cm) was closely related to sandy beaches and shallow
waters, and that this size class was commonly observed in
aggregations in these sites. These authors assigned this
fact primarily to anti-predatory strategies and secondarily

to feeding strategies, and suggested the use of sandy
beaches by young individuals as nursery areas (Aguiar,
2005; Aguiar et al., 2009). Despite P. falkneri and P. motoro
not being native to the upper Paraná River basin and
possessing a relatively recent history of occurrence in the
study area (Vazzoler et al., 1997; Garrone Neto et al., 2007),
it is possible that this behavior is also recurrent in these
taxa and among other species of potamotrygonids, with f1

marginal areas (in white) and deeper central areas (in gray), both in marginal lakes and in the main river channel.

individuals normally forming aggregations or looking for
shelter in shallow waters in lotic environments, associated
w i t h  s a n d y  b e a c h e s ,  o r  i n  d e e p e r  w a t e r s  i n  l e n t i c
environments, associated with muddy substrates.

The large stingrays realized daily bathymetric migrations,
occupying locations with different depths during the day
and at night, especially for feeding purposes. At night, they
were observed searching for preys in shallow waters, mainly
freshwater shrimps (Palaemonidae) and small fishes (mostly
Characiformes), using predominantly the hunting tactic
known as “charging in the shallows” (Garrone Neto &amp;amp;
Sazima, 2009a). During the day, those individuals were
observed resting in deeper places, eventually moving and
using the hunting tactic known as “undulate disc and stir
substrate” to prey upon aquatic insects and mollusks
(Ampullariidae) (Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Sazima, 2009a).

Matern et al. (2000), in a study of movement patterns of
the bat ray Myliobatis californica (Myliobatidae) in Tomales
Bay (California/USA), based on information obtained by
means of ultrasonic telemetry, suggested that the individuals
of this species carried out daily movements with the aim of
making the capture and digestion of food more efficient. In
this case, one of the factors which apparently exert a strong
influence on the animals’ patterns of movement is the water
temperature, with stingrays alternating their behavior
between foraging in shallow warmer waters, located in the
bay, and digestion in the open sea, with greater depth and
colder waters (Matern et al., 2000). This search for optimum
feeding temperatures seems to fit the model originally
described by McLaren (1963), where the post-foraging
relocation to cooler places reduces the energy demands of
the metabolism, by providing additional energy on account
of the reduction in the rate of gastric evacuation (Parrish &amp;amp;
Margraf, 1990; Cortes &amp;amp; Gruber, 1992), while food
assimilation efficiency is maintained (Brett, 1971) or possibly
intensified (Wetherbee &amp;amp; Gruber, 1990). To the size class f3
the temperature variation was not significant in this study,
although large individuals of P. falkneri and P. motoro
showed a strong association of feeding activity with depths
under four meters and at temperatures close to 24°C at night,
and resting activity with places where the depth is over
eight meters and the temperatures are near 22°C at day.

The intermediate-sized stingrays (class f2) occupied a
great diversity of environments and comprised the most
active of the three studied size classes. Individuals of this
size class are known to eat a wide variety of items in the
study area, including aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans,
small fishes, and even residues of artisanal and sport fisheries
(Silva &amp;amp; Uieda, 2007; Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Uieda, 2009), using
the two hunting tactics mentioned previously and another
one, least common, known as “picking up prey on vertical
and inclined substrata above water surface” (Garrone Neto
&amp;amp; Sazima, 2009a). Those behaviors demonstrated the great
flexibility of these individuals in the exploitation of resources
(habitat and food), while f1 individuals were basically

restricted to shallow areas and to a diet composed mainly of
insects, and f3 individuals consumed snails, shrimps and
small fishes. The versatility of the hunting behavior of
Potamotrygon spp. (Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Sazima, 2009a) also
contributed to the interspecific interactions observed
between P. falkneri and P. motoro and some species of
cichlids (Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Sazima, 2009b), and to their recent
and successful colonization of new areas and habitats in
the upper Paraná River basin (Garrone Neto et al., 2007;
Garrone Neto &amp;amp; Haddad Jr., 2010).

Ontogenetic variations in diet and in feeding behavior are
known for some species of elasmobranchs (e.g. Ebert, 2002;
Sisneros &amp;amp; Tricas, 2002; Wetherbee &amp;amp; Cortés, 2004). The
distribution of individuals in the environment may also have a
close relationship with their stage of development, as indicated
by the data obtained for P. falkneri and P. motoro in this study.
The field observations and the FCA analysis (see Fig. 4)
showed that f3 individuals alternate their position throughout
the day cycle (bathymetric migration), approaching the banks
during the night, whereas f1 stingrays are strongly associated
with beach and sandy substrate environments, and the f2 class
is present in different environments and depths, associated
with rocks and vegetation. Seasonal variations in activity,
spatial distribution and habitat use of the species of stingrays
here studied may likely occur, but as the peak of the rainy
period impairs the use of underwater observations in the
upper Paraná River basin, only the use of biotelemetry or
other similar technology (see Simpfendorfer &amp;amp; Heupel, 2004
for overviews) may enable the acquisition of these information
and expand our knowledge of the behavior of
potamotrygonids in their natural environment.
