Abstract  The authors present a quantitative and qualitative study on homicides among teenagers
in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, based on a historical series during the 1990s and
the life and death histories in this group, with a special focus on 1997. In that year there were 68
homicides in which the victims were from 10 to 19 years old. Of the 68, 62 were males and only 6
females, or a ratio of 10:1, showing that young males are more vulnerable and susceptible to being
murdered. The data indicate that cause of death is influenced by gender culture and that homi-
cides are based on power and status symbols characterizing a kind of virility. This expression of
virility in the shaping of violence also appears in the domination of the female body observed in
homicides with young women as the victims. The life and death histories of these teenagers high-
light the pertinence of the gender-based analysis as a theoretical-analytical category, in addition
to analyses considering socioeconomic aspects and social inequity.

Resumo  Este é um estudo quanti/qualitativo sobre homicídios entre adolescentes em Porto Ale-
gre, tendo como base uma seriação histórica para a década de 90 e as histórias de vida e morte nes-
se grupo, particularizando o ano de 1997. Nesse ano houve 68 homicídios na faixa etária de 10 a
19 anos, dos quais 62 do sexo masculino e 6 do sexo feminino, numa razão de 10:1, mostrando
que os homens estão mais vulneráveis e suscetíveis a morrer por essa causa de morte. Admite-se,
a partir disso, que as formas de morrer sofrem influência das culturas de gênero e os homicídios
se sustentam em símbolos e posições de poder que caracterizam um tipo de masculinidade. Essa
expressão de masculinidade na forma de violência mostra sua face também no domínio sobre o
corpo feminino, observado nas situações de homicídio envolvendo as mulheres adolescentes.
Esses achados apontam para a conotação relacional e para a assimetria social, expressão das cul-
turas de gênero, como atributos explicativos. As histórias de vida e morte desses adolescentes mos-
tram a pertinência das análises baseadas no gênero como categoria teórico-analítica, além das
análises que contemplam os aspectos sócio-econômicos e as iniqüidades sociais.

Introduction

This article is the result of a Master’s thesis pre-
sented in the Graduate Studies Program in Nurs-
ing at the Federal University in Rio Grande do
Sul (UFRGS), February 2000 (Sant’Anna, 2000).
The article adopts an analytical methodology
allowing a gender approach to the case series of
homicides among adolescents.

Homicides among adolescents are linked to
the overall issue of violence and require an ana-
lytical effort to jointly interpret the individual
data.

Most current explanatory models of violence
in Brazil are based on statistical studies which
rarely grasp the issue’s complexity. The need to
rethink this issue and reconstitute a series of
factors involved in homicides led us to focus on
primary data to correlate education, socializa-
tion (gender cultures), delinquency, interper-
sonal relations, and social conditions. In our
opinion, other factors (biological and intra-psy-
chological ones, among others) merit attention,
but in this study we adopted a gender culture
perspective and the analytical possibilities of
the gender concept as defined by the Anglo-Sax-
on literature.

Mortality from external causes is defined as
the sum of homicides, suicides, and fatal acci-
dents. Deaths from external causes are not dis-
tributed equally between males and females. Ac-
cording to the statistics consulted in this study,
violent deaths occur predominantly among
males (some 80% of the total in Porto Alegre
from 1990 to 1997).

Mortality distribution by gender shows males
with external causes as the third most common
causal category every year except 1998, when
respiratory tract diseases occupied third place.
Among females, external causes were the fourth
most common category only in 1990 and were
fifth in 1980, 1985, and 1995. These deaths also
varied as to the basic cause, with traffic accidents
as the main cause among females, unlike males,
in whom homicides were the main cause (Secre-
taria Municipal de Saúde de Porto Alegre, 1999).

The first phase of this study was conducted
using secondary statistical data from the State
Secretariat for Health and the Environment (SS-
MA) and the Porto Alegre Municipal Health Sec-
retariat (SMS) to construct a historical series of
homicides among adolescents in the 1990s, al-
lowing for an assessment of the magnitude of
this cause of death in the Porto Alegre popula-
tion (Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Porto
Alegre, 1999). The second stage of the study fo-
cused on the year 1997; we conducted an in-
depth study of the 68 teenage homicides that

occurred that year, with a reconstitution of the
life history of these adolescents. Note that the
complete statistics are not presented in this ar-
ticle due to space limitations, but they are avail-
able to interested readers.

According to Anglo-Saxon authors, and Joan
Scott (1990) in particular, gender is a constitu-
tive element in social relations based on per-
ceived differences between the sexes, and is the
first form ascribing meaning to power relations.
The author emphasizes that changes in the or-
ganization of social relations always correspond
to changes in representations of power, and that
such changes do not necessarily take a single
direction, but involve four different situations:
culturally constructed symbols, represented
by modalities and their contexts; normative
concepts, expressed in religious, educational,
scientific, political, and legal doctrines that de-
termine the meanings of male and female as
the product of a social consensus rather than a
conflict; construction of gender not exclusively
through the kinship situation but also through
economic and political organization; and final-
ly, subjective gender identity constructed from
historically situated social organizations and
representations. Scott further highlights that
these four elements operate interdependently,
but not simultaneously, as reflections of each
other, thus requiring historical research into
the relationships between them.

Another author who has studied gender and
social inequities with an emphasis on epidemi-
ology is Breilh (1996), who identifies asymmet-
rical gender relations as factors producing in-
equity, related to cultural and historical issues
in the sexual and biological differences between
men and women. The health/disease process
in the male/female universe is constructed in
the midst of social contradictions and specific
conditions in social reproduction. There are
patterns between males and females that differ-
entially expose individuals to the protective and
destructive processes influencing their health.

The homicide-related situations described in
this study are in a sense “compatible” with what
is socially legitimated as the standard for virili-
ty, since attributes related to physical strength,
courage, and tenacity, among others, constitute
a positive form of virile social identity (Lopes,
1996). Such sex-related “attributes” constitute
what we refer to as “genders” and partially ex-
plain the prevalence of homicides among males
and the violence that is intimately related to re-
lations of power and domination, making men
victims of their own actions.

Breilh (1996) adds that violence is directly
related to inequity, which can be influenced by a



Cad. Saúde Pública, Rio de Janeiro, 18(6):1509-1517, nov-dez, 2002

combination of three factors: economic oppres-
sion, ethnic discrimination (including racial
discrimination), and gender violence. 

Within this context, we adopt other con-
cepts capable of helping us “deal with” the is-
sues raised. We thus use the concept of “vulner-
ability” as defined by Lert (1996) as the variants
constituting the individual and collective di-
mensions defining a risk situation. Thus, in this
study, vulnerability is constituted by the variants
contributing to the context of violent deaths
among adolescents. As for individual vulnera-
bility, we high light the need to always contextu-
alize it in reference to a situation, or to a given
moment within a given society.

Based on this conceptual approach, what we
refer to as a “risk situation” is the set of factors
or vulnerabilities which – from the point of view
of public health – constitute the social facts
and relations (especially gender relations) that
predispose to violent deaths. Thus, this article
adopts the definition of vulnerability according
to the meaning of social risk of delinquency and
death.

Methodology

Due to the complex, multidimensional nature of
the proposed analysis, we adopted a pluralistic
methodology capable of harboring perspec-
tives that would allow for a multifaceted un-
derstanding of the theme. This choice led us to
propose an approach to what could be called a
combinative or hybrid terrain. From this same
perspective, the methodological/analytical pro-
posal used statistics for the analysis of quantifi-
able data and content analysis to categorize and/
or quantify the qualitative or discursive data.

Several authors discuss the use of a hybrid
methodology. Cortes (1998) refers to the use of
qualitative analysis as an adjunct or illustrative
method in research that mainly uses quantita-
tive analytical techniques or the combination
of the two methodologies, without a clear pre-
dominance of one over the other.

With regard to the joint utilization of quan-
titative and qualitative methods, Minayo (1992)
argues that the quality of the facts and social
relations are their inherent properties and that
quantity and quality are inseparable and inter-
dependent, hence requiring the dissolution of
quantitative/qualitative dichotomies.

In this study, the statistical analyses are fre-
quently punctual, cannot be generalized, and
comprise an interpretative analytical frame-
work. They frequently highlight the broader sce-
nario of the specific facts under investigation.

HOMICIDES AMONG TEENAGERS: VULNERABILITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND GENDER CULTURES 1511

The subjects of this study were adolescent
homicide victims from the year 1997 and their
families. Adolescence was defined according to
the Brazilian Ministry of Health as the age brack-
et from 10 to 19 years (CNPD, 1997).

The year 1997 was chosen during the pro-
ject’s preparatory phase, in 1998, when the data-
base of the National Mortality Information Sys-
tem (SIM) underwent a quality control process
which allowed to work with these data.

The epidemiological demarcation for the
study of external causes is the historical series
from the 1990s and the case series for the year
1997, since the study focused only on families
who had lost an adolescent child to homicide
during this historical cross-section. Fletcher et
al. (1989) define a case series as a prevalence
study in a group of individuals with a given dis-
ease or injury, held at a single moment in time.
This demarcation allowed for an exploratory
study of the life and death histories of these
adolescents. The seriation was longitudinal for
the 1990s and allowed for some comparisons.

Relating to the 68 adolescent homicide vic-
tims in 1997, 64 families were located. Eight
families refused to participate, and 57 inter-
views were actually conducted. Three address-
es were not located, so families not found and
those which refused totaled 11 interviews not
conducted, or 16.2% of the total sample. Semi-
directed structured interviews were held with
the families with the aid of a data collection in-
strument. The instrument consisted of closed
and open questions. The closed questions pro-
vided data for the socio-demographic and epi-
demiological analytical quantification, based
on the selected variables. The open questions
were structured to supplement the socio-de-
mographic and epidemiological information,
and based on the thematic categorizations. They
allowed us to unveil, learn about, and under-
stand the dynamics of the individual, family,
and social factors that had exposed the adoles-
cents to homicide. In short, they composed the
vulnerability to homicide risk situations in the
study group.

Considering the notions of vulnerability and
risk situation, the study variables were grouped
according to three dimensions: socio-economic
processes of the adolescents and their families;
the adolescents’ family processes; and the ado-
lescents’ individual processes.

To study the quantitative variables, a de-
scriptive analysis of the data was performed,
based on simple frequency tables, central ten-
dency and dispersion measures, and a propor-
tional comparison test. The study also used ta-
bles cross-analyzing the socioeconomic vari-

ables, gender, and race with variables on previ-
ous history and information on the death.

Deaths were also located spatially on the city
map using the Georeferenced Information Sys-
tem (GIS), where the spatial unit was the neigh-
borhood, allowing for a comparison of the city’s
various neighborhoods based on social indica-
tors from the census conducted by the Brazilian
Institute for Geography and Statistics, or Nation-
al Census Bureau (IBGE, 1999). This compari-
son indicates a concentration of these events
in neighborhoods characterized by adverse so-
cial indicators.

Since homicides have legal implications, in
order to comply with ethical research princi-
ples we kept the identity of the research sub-
jects secret and guaranteed the information’s
confidentiality. Families were informed verbal-
ly about the research objectives and received
an Informed Consent form, requesting the in-
terviewee’s authorization and signature attest-
ing to his/her knowledge of the document’s con-
tent.

Results

Gender, external causes, and homicides – 
some data

Table 1 shows that males were the main victims
of homicides during the seven year period, al-
though there was a slight increase in homicides
among females in all age brackets, especially
from 10 to 19 years.

Homicide rates among males showed a cer-
tain regularity during the period studied, with

a slight decrease from 1994 onward. From 1990
to 1997 the rates varied by 3.7%. Male homi-
cides in the 10 to 19 year bracket varied by 7.6%.
For females, the rate varied 3.80% overall and
7.70% in the 10 to 19 year bracket.

In Porto Alegre, all deaths from external
causes also occur predominantly in males, with
some 80% of the total during the study period.
Comparing Tables 1 and 2, the trend in the pro-
portion of deaths from external causes in Porto
Alegre is similar to that in the State of Rio Gran-
de do Sul as a whole. However, in Porto Alegre
male and female deaths have increased in ab-
solute numbers since 1994, except for the years
1996 and 1997, when deaths from external caus-
es in women decreased by approximately 10%.
As shown in Table 2, 88% of homicides occurred
in males in Porto Alegre, while inversely, female
victims were less than 12%. Specifically in 1993,
less than 5% of all homicide victims were has
females.

In the 10 to 19 year age bracket there was
no variation in the proportion of homicides in
males and females until 1992. In 1993 there
were no female homicide victims, so the pro-
portion of males was greater than in 1994, but
in absolute numbers there was an increase of
33% among male victims that year. The ab-
sence of female homicide victims in 1993 may
be related to the inclusion of “events of inde-
terminate intent” among females, which in-
creased by 100% in 1993.

Despite the higher proportion of homicides
among males as compared to females, from 1995
to 1996 there was a drop of 25% in deaths among
males and an increase of 80% in females. In
1997, male homicide victims increased by ap-

proximately 83%, while in females there was a
decrease of 3%. 

These statistical disparities attest to difficul-
ties in the registry services. This problem ham-
pered the analyses, requiring an effort at con-
structing a reliable explanatory approach. How-
ever, focusing on 1997, the year selected for the
in-depth study, produces the following por-
trait.

Table 3 provides data on adolescents from
the 57 families added to the information for the
11 losses (families not located plus refusals),
whose data were taken from the death certifi-
cates. Among these 68 deaths, males predomi-
nated, with 91.2%, or a 10:1 male/female ratio.

To kill or to be killed: 
the fate of the male gender?

Violence is “a man’s thing”. This claim is almost
a form of praise in certain contexts! The vast
majority (91.2%) of the homicide victims were
males, showing that men are more vulnerable
and susceptible to dying such violent deaths.
This does not occur only with homicides, but
also with other deaths from external causes, as
described previously.

All the homicides with known perpetrators
were committed by males, indicating that this
type of violence is associated with a type of mas-
culine conduct. In the study population, this is
valid for both the victim and the aggressor, thus
characterizing a homicide-prone situation pre-
dominantly involving men.

Homicides in the study group were related
to socially accepted behaviors, linked to power
struggles involving macho cultural traits. The

majority of the victims were men murdered by
other men, and the killers of women were also
men.

The lower proportion of female homicide
victims (8.8%) also indicates that the motives
and situations differ between the genders in this
population group. The facts surrounding these
murders are different for men and women and
are associated with cultural representations of
social gender relations. This evidence can be
observed in the Tables.

Table 4 shows the distribution of alleged mo-
tives for homicides in males. The most frequent
explanations provided by families of victims
were “senseless” killing, followed by revenge,
involvement with drugs, participation in rob-
beries, and “wipeouts” (i.e., victims who were
murdered because they “knew too much”).

In the words of victims’ families, “delin-
quents” appeared as the main perpetrators of
homicides committed against other males,
followed by a variety of other aggressors, like
strangers, others, friends, relatives, and the po-
lice, in that order.

Deaths classified as “senseless” killings in-
volved arguments and fights at parties or in the
neighborhoods, triggered by power struggles,
differences of opinion between groups, or mur-
ders with no explanation whatsoever.

In one situation, a teenage boy had gone to
celebrate his birthday at a pizza joint. He was at-
tacked while he was on his way home with a girl
cousin. The situation illustrates what the moth-
er defined as a senseless killing. According to
her, “My son and niece were waiting at the bus
stop and the Passo das Pedras bus was running
late, so they took the Leopoldina. And these kids
started hitting on my niece in the bus, so my son
decided they should get off near an ATM, right?

But he could never have imagined that those
three guys would come after them. And getting
off the bus... those kids came running after them.
And I don’t know how he reacted, I guess he just
stood still and didn’t run, just shouted. He just
shouted for my niece to run. And he just stood
there. So one of those kids pulled a knife out of
his backpack and stabbed him. And a police-
man who testified caught the kid, said that he
saw him when he still just had his hands up
and... [weeping]” (mother).

The interview describes a kind of unjustifi-
able conduct on the aggressor’s part in a situa-
tion where the victim had played no active part
in any crime. The circumstance surrounding his
death illustrate an aggressive attitude in a power
struggle among males. Competition for “win-
ning behaviors” consecrates such a male iden-
tity. Proving one’s manliness through socially
consecrated conduct based on intimidation and
violent acts is one such attitude.

In murder for revenge, the act is supposedly
“justified” by the victim’s presumed participa-
tion in the process. Many of these adolescent
victims had displayed violent attitudes, includ-
ing involvement in fights, physical aggression,
and crimes against property and lives, provok-
ing in their aggressors a thirst for justice, config-
ured in an act of vengeance.

The stories of these homicides reveal these
situations and illustrate our analyses: “So on the
day he died, a Tuesday, he’d been at my house on
Monday. He’d been fighting with a guy, at a par-
ty, on New Year’s Day, and he killed the guy. He
killed him. So 21 days after he’d killed this boy
who lived nearby... his father killed him, this
boy’s father killed my kid” (mother).

Another alleged motive for homicides in ado-
lescents was involvement with drugs or drug
dealers. Only males were exposed to this risk
situation, indicating a kind of conduct involving
the conquest of economic power, where “illic-
it” conduct is associated with challenging the
established order, besides highlighting the lack
of job opportunities for poor Brazilian youths.

One victim’s sister-in-law reported that the
drug traffic was this teenager’s only alternative
for survival, fueling a climate of dispute, fear,
and death: “(...) reality? What can I say? He sold
drugs... he was involved with drugs. But he didn’t
kill anybody, wasn’t hurting anybody. He was just
hurting himself. I don’t know what happened...
these gang things where they say so-and-so killed
somebody, or what’s-his-name killed somebody
else. But he hadn’t done anything. And he didn’t
do anything. That was all he was doing [dealing
drugs], and even cried about it. He used to say to
his older brother, my husband, ‘I do this to sur-

HOMICIDES AMONG TEENAGERS: VULNERABILITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND GENDER CULTURES 1515

vive. So my old man won’t go hungry. I don’t like
this life of mine. But I got no job, got no educa-
tion’. And it so happened that he was at a play
selling... and then he called out to his brother.
He was drunk, high. He called, shouted... I don’t
know if there was somebody chasing him, he was
suspicious... he called out to his brother, but his
brother didn’t go to the door... just said his broth-
er must be fooling around on the street. So when
his brother... his brother just heard the shots.
When he heard the shots the whole thing had
already happened. When he got to the door the
shooting had already happened. There wasn’t
time. I don’t know if it was a hit job... because
these things... who sells more... who sells less, you
know? In the ‘hood... they think they have to...
they have to sell more, you know? I think that
must of been it, I don’t know” (sister-in-law).

Fights over women are also behind homi-
cides. Keeping power over the turf is based on
controlling the women, through the power over
the female body, and the women are not allowed
to get emotionally involved with someone who
does not belong to the group. “He killed my
brother because he was seeing a girl from the
place where he lived. Cause a lot of people from
there where this kid lives don’t like people from
our street. Cause since my brother lived here,
even though he wasn’t in any kind of trouble, he
lived here on this street, right?” (sister).

Other situations, like gang fights, robberies,
fights between friends, and “wipeouts” indicate
that vulnerability to homicide is characterized
by a kind of “masculine” conduct that involves
constructing and circulating in areas suscepti-
ble to these risks. Such kinds of conduct are “ex-
pected” of males, imposing challenges and risks
on their physical integrity.

From this perspective, according to Willis
(1991:52), violence is one way of expressing
manhood, “regulating a kind of honor”. Accord-
ing to the author, it is a way of manifesting viril-
ity and maintaining group hierarchy.

This expression of manhood through vio-
lence also occurs in the command over the fe-
male body. Motives for teenage homicides dif-
fered between girls and boys. As shown in Table
4, the main reason for homicides against girls
was “jealousy” on the part of the male partner
or former partner, the perpetrator.

Such homicides against women also suggest
gender cultures as explanatory attributes. The
boyfriends of the three teenage girls had char-
acteristics in common: they all had criminal
records and had been involved in robberies,
homicides, and drug dealing. Their relation-
ship to the girls was one of possession, and the
murders all occurred when the females reacted

unexpectedly to impositions on their own con-
duct. As one mother reported, “He was very jeal-
ous, I mean sick, because he killed her out of jeal-
ousy. She had gone out to dance. He went up-
stairs with her, she wasn’t with him any more, she
had separated from him because of this child she
had to give away and because he was very jeal-
ous of her. He wanted her but he didn’t want the
children. He stalked her, came to our house, and
killed her” (mother).

Saffioti (1994) studied these situations and
concluded that public space is eminently mas-
culine and that men are more exposed to vio-
lence from other men in these places. Women
suffer violence in the private domain, and their
aggressors are generally former husbands, part-
ners, or boyfriends.

Based on data from the Brazilian National
Census Bureau (IBGE) in 1988, 70% of the homi-
cides perpetrated by men against women are
related to the man’s refusal to accept a separa-
tion (IBGE, 1988). The circumstances involving
the three female teenagers in this study who
were killed by their [former] partners corrobo-
rate these findings.

Circumstances surrounding the murders
of the other two teenage girls were as follows:
one was with a group that was playing Russian
roulette, and since she voiced her opinion
against this game, she was killed outright by one
of the players; the other was raped and then
murdered. The latter case illustrates physical
force as an instrument of male power over the
female body.

The mother’s account of her teenage daugh-
ter’s death confirms that her daughter had been
defenseless: “So he grabbed her and started
dragging her away. They said the other girls saw
it happening, like he threatened her. They said it
was a group [weeping]. They said he used a hunt-
ing rifle. And they said that... he did what he had
to do, right. That he shot her in the head. She
started to shout, to cry out for help. The police
said the noise was muffled by a mattress and a
pillow so nobody would hear the shots. Then he
tried to bury her, so no one would see”(mother).

Risk situations: vulnerability arguments

Teenage deaths need to be related to the risk
situations to which these adolescents are ex-
posed. Table 5 illustrates how these situations
occur both with males and females and express
gender susceptibility through involvement in il-
licit contexts.

The majority of the teenage girls who were
murdered consumed illicit drugs (60%). Among
the teenage boys, the proportion of drug users



SANT’ANA, A. R. &amp;amp; LOPES, M. J. M.1516

Cad. Saúde Pública, Rio de Janeiro, 18(6):1509-1517, nov-dez, 2002

(34.6%) was high, but not the majority, accord-
ing to the families. This information should be
interpreted with caution, since among males
there were ten cases in which their drug con-
sumption was ignored by the family members
interviewed.

In this population group, only males used
weapons, denoting an explicit attack-or-de-

fend attitude. Males, unlike females, adhered
more frequently to the private use of all types of
weapons, or gun use as a “sport”.

No statistically significant difference was ob-
served in the variables among males and fe-
males based on whether the deceased had spent
time in FEBEM (the State Foundation for the
Welfare of Minors, a government reformatory
system) or had police records. However, in rela-
tion to police records, males had participated in
more serious crimes, like robberies, drug traffic,
assault, and homicides, while females tended to
have been involved in petty theft, for example.

These risk situations partially explain the
predominance of homicides among males, since
these young men displayed attitudes that trig-
ger violence, thus becoming more exposed to
this outcome. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of
the five teenage girls who were murdered is re-
lated to passive attitudes towards their aggres-
sors, which is culturally expected of women and
occurs more explicitly in the more vulnerable
social strata. This relationship is confirmed by
the difference in plans for the future: 60% of the
teenage girls (3/5) had no explicit ideals, unlike
the teenage boys, whose main life projects were
to study and get ahead professionally. The two
teenage girls who had plans for the future were
focused on more immediate situations (that is,
the near future), like work and consumer goals,
life changes, and dedication to family.

The involvement of teenage girls in violent
situations has reinforced the idea that their
emotional ties to the male perpetrators still ac-
counts for their victimization. This attests to
the fact that the cultural basis of male-over-fe-
male domination continues to express itself in
symbols and life styles. This basis, far from pro-
tecting “manhood”, makes males susceptible
and vulnerable to becoming aggressors and
aggressed. Without intending to fuel the de-
bate on the supremacy of one gender over the
other, we do wish to contribute to reflection and
to highlight comprehensive elements for con-
structing a reality that will no longer reproduce
such inequities.
