ABSTRACT 

 

CAPODIFOGLIO, K. R. H. Systematics and molecular characterization of new 

myxosporean species parasites of Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus brachypomus 

from the Amazon basin and remarks on mitochondrial behavior in myxosporeans. 2019.

São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2019. 

 

The Amazon basin has about 7000 km2 of extension and a vast biodiversity providing an 

ichthyofauna of approximately 5000 species of fish. Myxozoan parasites cause diseases in fish 

in both the natural environment and the breeding systemand they are responsible for high 

mortality rates. Myxozoans show a great diversity of species with some of them, highly 

pathogenic and, therefore, have been receiving attention of the researchers. In Brazil, due to the 

great diversity of fish species, the study of these parasites has been gaining the attention of the 

researchers, focusing on diversity, biology and parasite-host interaction. In this context, the 

objective of this work was to explore the parasite diversity of the Myxozoa subphylum, through 

morphological and molecular analyses of myxosporean parasites of Amazonian fish, important 

for the food market such as Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) and Piaractus brachypomus 

(pirapitinga). For the taxonomic study, morphological analyses were performed using light 

microscopy and molecular analyses using ssrDNA. The fish were captured in the Amazon 

basin, in the Tapajós and Solimões Rivers, Santarém, PA and Manaus, AM, respectively. Two 

new myxosporean species, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, were described infecting 

C. macropomum, based on morphological and molecular data. Myxobolus colossomatis, found 

infecting C. macropomum, was considered a distinct species of Myxobolus cf. colossomatis 

described in Piaractus mesopotamicus, through molecular and phylogenetic data. For P. 

brachypomus four new species were described. Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3, 

were described through of morphological, histological, ultra-structural and molecular analyses. 

Henneguya n. sp. 2 and Myxobolus n. sp. 4 were described based in morphological and 

molecular data. After observing the mitochondrial behavior of myxospores through electron 

microscopy studies, we performed an experiment of mitochondrial fluorescence microscopy 

and the results showed that few Henneguya sp. myxospores presented labeling for 

mitochondrial activity. 

 

Key-words: Myxozoa, ssrDNA, tambaqui, pirapitinga, Amazon River, mitochondrial

RESUMO 

 

CAPODIFOGLIO, K. R. H. Sistemática e caracterização molecular de novas espécies de 

mixosporídeos parasitos de Colossoma macropomum e Piaractus brachypomus da bacia 

Amazônica e observações sobre o comportamento mitocondrial em mixosporídeos. 2019. 

150 f. Tese (Doutorado) – Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade 

de São Paulo, Pirassununga, 2019. 

 

A bacia Amazônica tem cerca de 7000 km2 de extensão e uma vasta biodiversidade abrigando 

uma ictiofauna de, aproximadamente, 5000 espécies de peixes. Parasitos mixozoários são 

causadores de doenças em peixes de ambiente natural e de sistemas de criação sendo 

responsáveis por altas taxas de mortalidade. Mixosporídeos apresentam uma grande diversidade 

de espécies com algumas destas, altamente patogênicas e, por isso, vêm recebendo atenção dos 

pesquisadores. No Brasil, devido à grande diversidade de espécies de peixes, o estudo destes 

parasitos vem ganhando cada vez mais destaque, com foco para a diversidade, biologia e a 

interação parasito-hospedeiro. Neste contexto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi explorar a 

diversidade de parasitos do subfilo Myxozoa, através de análises morfológicas e moleculares 

de mixosporídeos parasitos de peixes amazônicos, importantes para o mercado de alimentos 

como Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) e Piaractus brachypomus (pirapitinga). Para o 

estudo taxonômico foram realizadas análises morfológicas, utilizando microscopia de luz, e 

análises moleculares utilizando o sequenciamento do ssrDNA. Os peixes foram capturados na 

bacia Amazônica, nos rios Tapajós e Solimões, Santarém, PA e Manaus, AM, respectivamente. 

Duas novas espécies de mixosporídeos, Myxobolus sp. n. 1 e Myxobolus sp. n. 2, foram descritas 

infectando C. macropomum, baseado em dados morfológicos e moleculares. Myxobolus 

colossomatis encontrada infectando C. macropomum foi considerada uma espécie distinta de 

Myxobolus cf. colossomatis descrita em Piaractus mesopotamicus, através de dados 

moleculares e filogenéticos. Para P. brachypomus quatro novas espécies foram descritas. 

Henneguya sp. n. 1 e Myxobolus sp. n. 3 foram descritas através de análises morfológicas, 

histológicas, ultra-estruturais e moleculares. Henneguya sp. n. 2 e Myxobolus sp. n. 4 foram 

descritas baseadas em dados morfológicos e moleculares. Após a observação do 

comportamento mitocondrial de mixosporídeos através de estudos de microscopia eletrônica, 

nós realizamos um experimento de microscopia de fluorescência mitocondrial e os resultados 

obtidos demonstraram que poucos mixosporos de Henneguya sp. apresentaram marcação para 

a atividade mitocondrial.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

 1.1 Basin of the Amazon River 

The South American has potential for expansion of the aquaculture and a large number 

of native species, which represent 24% of the described species of the world (SCHAEFER, 

1998). Furthermore, the continent has a large number of rivers and lakes that constitute the 

largest river basin in the world, the Amazon basin (TUNDISI, 2003). 

Amazonian effluents are born in the Andes mountain range, in Peru (TRANCOSO, 

2006), and it presents, in all its extension, a dense and complex network of streams, called 

igarapés (JUNK, 1983). 

With about 6.500 km2 of extension (GOULDING, 1996), Amazon basin is intersected 

by the Amazon River and thousands of others rivers (SIOLI, 1967) and is known for its vast 

water availability, with approximately 20% of all fresh water on the planet (TUNDISI, 2003). 

In addition to having plenty of water, the Amazon basin has a vast biodiversity and is 

one of the planet's most productive and intact ecosystems (SANTOS; SANTOS, 2005), 

harboring an ichthyofauna of approximately 5000 species of fish (VAL; HONCZARYK, 1995).     

According with Lundberg et al. (2000) it is believed that only 40% of the Amazonian 

ichthyofauna is known, indicating that this system is poorly understood and underestimated. 

Brazil is home to a large part of this ichthyofauna, although the knowledge about its 

composition in the different Brazilian watersheds is deficient and irregular, such fact can be 

verified observing places with more species, with economic, ecological and social importance, 

and that several species threatened are not studied and preserved (MENEZES et al., 2007).  

 

1.2 Amazonian fish of economic importance 

  Brazilian North, more specifically Amazonas and Pará states, is one of the main region 

producers of fish. In 2010, the region was responsible for than more two hundred thousand tons 



26 
 

of fish produced. Among the fish produced in the northern region the main targets in the 

extractive fishery are Characiformes fish. (MPA, 2012). 

The Characiformes order is one of the largest groups of freshwater fish, with 2400 

species divided in, approximately, 520 genera (NELSON, 2006). Serrasalmidae family, 

belonging to Characiformes order, shelters fish known popularly as “myleus”, “piranhas” and, 

with stand out, “pacus” (CALCAGNOTTO et al., 2005; MIRANDE, 2010). 

The pacus group includes economically important species because they are considered 

high quality food, such as the species Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, commonly 

known as “tambaqui” and Piractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818 known as “pirapitinga” 

(IBAMA, 2007). 

Colossoma macropomum is the second largest scale fish in South America, weighing 

up to 30 kg and measuring approximately 90 cm in length, being a fish very appreciated by the 

riverside communities of the Amazon (LOPERA-BARRERO et al., 2011). 

Tambaqui is a fish with solitary behavior and that survives in mineral-poor water 

(FROESE; PAULY, 2018).   

It is a frugivorous fish in adulthood, making it one of the main seed dispersers for many 

species of plants in the Amazonian floodplains (ANDERSON et al., 2011).  

The natural stocks of this species have been drastically reduced in recent years 

(SANTOS; SANTOS, 2005) and because this, the cultivation of this fish has been the solution 

for overexploitation. Tambaqui is the most cultivated species in the Brazilian Amazon and is 

widely used in breeding systems throughout the country, reaching 66% of all national 

production between 2007 and 2009 (LOPERA-BARRERO, 2011). 

In 2011, Brazilian aquaculture produced about 628 thousand tons of fish. Of these, 544 

thousand tons were produced by continental fish farming, with tambaqui being one of the main 



27 
 

species produced, making the country reach 12th place in the world ranking (BRAZIL, 2013a, 

BRAZIL, 2013b). 

Piaractus brachypomus, commonly known as “pirapitinga”, is a species that can to 

reach 80 cm in length and weigh up to 20 kg (SOBRINHO et al., 1984). It has an omnivorous 

food habit, with tendency to herbivory, consuming fruits and seeds in the period of the flood, 

in which its availability is greater. The pirapitinga makes two migrations during the year, one 

at the beginning of the flood, between November and February, for spawning and another at 

the beginning of the ebb, between June and October, when the species leaves the flooded forest 

to the headwaters of rivers (HERNÁNDEZ, 1994; SANTOS; FERREIRA; ZUANON, 2006). 

The cultivation of P. brachypomus in Brazil reached a production of approximately 10 

thousand tons among the pure native species (MPA, 2013a). 

In addition to being widely used in fishing, pirapitinga has been used in fish farming at 

crossing with tambaqui, generating the hybrid tambatinga that has desirable characteristics for 

management (SANTOS; FERREIRA; ZUANON, 2006). In addition, the species presents great 

importance in the gastronomy and the commercial fishing as ornamental fish (SOBRINHO et 

al., 1984). 

In the aquaculture production of freshwater, tambaqui and pirapitinga have aroused the 

interest of fish producers from several Brazilian states, where tambaqui production exceeded 

54 thousand tons and pirapitinga reached 780 thousand tons in 2010 (MPA, 2012). 

 

1.3 Myxozoans  

Ichthyofauna may to host a diversity of organisms and, with this, affect the development 

of host species (EIRAS, 2004; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). Studies involving parasitic 

infections in fish have intensified in recent years due to the morbidity and mortality that these 

pathogens can cause in fish from fish farms and the natural environment (FEIST; 



28 
 

LONGSHAW, 2006) and the aquatic environment facilitates the penetration of these pathogens 

(EIRAS, 1994). Fish breeding systems are more prone to infections due to the high density and 

handling where disease outbreaks are most likely to occur. Thus, the mass production of 

cultured fish is always accompanied by pathogens (RÜCKERT et al., 2008). Among the fish 

pathogens, stand out the parasites of the phylum Cnidaria, the myxozoans. 

Myxozoans are common and occasionally highly problematic parasites of fish 

(OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). These parasites are multicellular, spore 

forming and which have tissue tropism and host specificity (BÉKÉSI; SZÉKELY; MOLNÁR, 

2002; ATKINSON, 2011). They are formed by the junction of two to seven valves in the form 

of myxospores, which are the resistant forms of the parasite. They present polar capsules, 

containing a polar filament in spiral form with function of fixation in the host. Inside the 

myxospore are also sporoplasm with amoeboid forms, which are infecting cells for the new 

host. These parasites develop in plasmodia that may or may not cause tissue compression and 

an inflammatory response of the host (EIRAS, 1994; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). 

Approximately 2,400 species are known, distributed in 63 genera (FIALA; 

BARTOŠOVÁ-SOJKOVÁ; WHIPPS, 2015), with the most prominent genera being 

Henneguya Thélohan, 1892 and Myxobolus Bütschli, 1882. The majority of species are not 

pathogenic, however, some cause significant damages to their hosts in the natural environment 

and/or breeding systems (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). 

Myxobolus cerebralis Hofer, 1903 is one of the most studied species, with great impact 

on mortality of salmonids and wide distribution, causing a disease called "whirling disease" 

(EL-WELL et al., 2009). The parasite develops cysts in the cartilaginous tissue, from which it 

feeds, causing inflammation and damage to the adjacent central nervous system causing the fish 

to have a rotating behavior (GILBERT; GRANATH, 2003). In the rocky Mountain region, in 



29 
 

the United States, M. cerebralis was identified as responsible for the decline in population of 

rainbow trout also in a natural environment (ALLEN; BERGERSEN, 2002). 

In addition to M. cerebralis, several other species of myxosporeans are reported to cause 

significant damage to their hosts, such as Kudoa thyrsites Whipps and Kent, 2006, which cause, 

postmortem, muscle liquefaction in several species of marine fish, leading to significant 

economic losses to commercial fishing (WHIPPS; KENT, 2006).  Ceratonova shasta (syn. 

Ceratomyxa shasta) causes enteronecrosis and is a common parasite in salmonids from North 

American responsible for high mortality rates in juvenile salmon in the states of California and 

Oregon (ATKINSON; BARTHOLOMEW, 2010). Henneguya ictaluri Pote, Hanson and 

Shivaji, 2000 causes proliferative disease of the gills in catfish from breeding systems in the 

South of the United States (GRIFFIN et al., 2008). Henneguya pseudoplatystoma cause 

stretching and deformation of the filament and lamella structure in catfish in the South 

American (NALDONI et al., 2009). The plasmodial development of Myxobolus hilarii in the 

renal tubules of Brycon hilarii from fish farm, causes compression and deformation of adjacent 

tissues and destruction of renal tubule cells (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2016). 

 

1.4 Life cycle 

For the first time, Wolf and Markiw, 1984, elucidated the life cycle of M. cerebralis in 

a revolutionary study that changed the understanding of the biology of the myxosporids, 

demonstrating that the species presented an indirect life cycle, involving a myxospore stage in 

vertebrate hosts and an actinospore stage that developed in invertebrate hosts. 

The life cycle of the myxozoans, in general, involves two host which typically are 

invertebrates and vertebrates, as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. They utilise 

annelids as definitive hosts and, in addition to fish, amphibians, reptiles and homeotherms are 



30 
 

used as intermediate hosts of myxosporeans (OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 

2015). 

In the species in which the life cycle was studied, such as M. cerebralis, in the annelid 

phase it is initiated by the infection of these by myxospores. These myxospores are ingested by 

the annelid (usually an oligochaete), and when in contact with the intestinal epithelium, releases 

the polar filaments for anchorage of the parasite in the new host. At this time, the valves open 

and myxospores amoeboid sporoplasm is released, penetrating between the epithelial cells of 

the intestine. The binucleated sporoplasm undergoes several nuclear divisions and this process 

results in the formation of actinospores, which when released from the intestinal epithelial cells 

of annelids, which enter the aquatic environment together with the feces and serve as a source 

of infection for the fish. Free actinospores in water are infective to the intermediate host (usually 

fish), which in contact with the vertebrate host extrude the polar filaments, anchoring in the 

new host. Then, the sporoplasm is released from the actinospore and penetrates the host through 

the gills, skin, buccal cavity and also, intestinal. After penetration, the sporoplasm wall 

dissolves and the infecting cells invade adjacent tissues. The parasite reaches the target tissue, 

by circulation or intercellular migration, where occurs the development of the plasmodium and 

sporogony process, characteristic for each species, where are formed myxospores with distinct 

morphology of the actinospores (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006).  

 

1.5 Taxonomy of myxosporean species 

Due to importance of myxosporeans parasites, many studies have been developed by 

scientists in natural environments and aquacultures for the purpose of to describe new species, 

and to understand hosts–myxosporeans life cycles, morphology, hosts infection sites and 

phylogenetic position (ALAMA-BERMEJO; RAGA; HOLZER, 2011; AZEVEDO et al., 2014; 

ROCHA et al., 2015). 



31 
 

The tradicional taxonomic identification of the myxosporeans is based on 

morphological parameters and developmental stages of the myxospores and of the plasmodia, 

as well as the specificity to the host and the tissue that infect have been widely used. For a long 

time, studies of identification of news myxosporean species have used only morphologic 

methods (LOM; ARTHUR, 1989; OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). Most 

myxozoan species have a specificity to single host species or family, being used as important 

character for distinguishing myxosporean species (MOLNÁR, 1994). In additional, other 

characters such as tissue specificity, traits of developmental stages data can be clear 

incorporated to improve classification (OKAMURA; GHRUL, 2015). 

However, taxonomic classification based only in morphological analyses has its 

limitations due the high level of natural morphological and morphometric variation in spores 

and, sometimes, to present debatable results due the similarity between myxospores, hampering 

the taxonomic classification (ATKINSON et al., 2015).  

Thus, Kent et al. (2001); Zhao et al. (2008); Fiala et al. (2015) proposed that the 

utilization of morphological and molecular techniques is fundamental and complementary for 

identification of news species and also to avoid taxonomic confusion in myxosporeans. 

In South America, our group of the Laboratory of Immunology of Parasites (LIP), of 

the University of São Paulo was the first to associate morphological and molecular data for 

myxosporean species with the description of Myxobolus cordeiroi Adriano, Arana, Alves, 

Silva, Ceccarelli, Henrique-Silva and Maia, 2009 parasite of Zungaro jahu from Brazilian 

Pantanal. After this, many species have been described based on morphological and molecular 

data in economically important fish (AGUIAR; ADRIANO; MATHEWS, 2017; AZEVEDO et 

al., 2010; CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2016; CARRIERO et al., 2013; MATHEWS; MAIA; 

ADRIANO, 2016; MILANIN et al., 2010; MOREIRA et al., 2014; NALDONI et al., 2009; 

2011; ROCHA et al., 2014; VELASCO et al., 2016; ZATTI et al., 2015; 2018).  



32 
 

Approximately 120 myxosporean species were described in the South American 

freshwater and marine environments (ADRIANO; OLIVEIRA, 2019). And still there are many 

undescribed myxosporean species (ZATTI et al., 2018), as well diversity of other myxozoans 

is underestimated (ATKINSON et al., 2015). 

 

1.6 Molecular markers for identification of myxosporeans 

Recent molecular studies with myxosporeans have as main approach the amplification 

of the gene responsible for the coding of the small subunit Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ssrDNA) 

(MOLNÁR et al., 2002; FERGUSON et al., 2008; FIALA, 2006; MILANIN et al., 2010; 

NALDONI et al., 2011; CARRIERO, 2011). This approach has been shown to be efficient for 

identifying and separating phylogenetically distant species, but it is not indicated to evaluate 

the occurrence of intraspecific variations or between phylogenetically closely related species. 

Through morphologic and morphometric data, and sites of infection was observed that 

species of  Myxobolus and Henneguya genera that infect Piaractus corruscans from the 

Pantanal are also found infecting Piaractus reticulatum from the same environment 

(CARRIERO, 2011). These data were corroborated by the molecular analyses, from the partial 

sequence of the ssrDNA (CARRIERO, 2011; ADRIANO et al., 2012). Nevertheless, 

alignments of sequences showed variations, even if small, between samples of the same parasite 

species found in P. corruscans compared with samples from P. reticulatum. 

In 2003, Herbet et al. proposed a system of molecular identification, a universal 

"bioidentifier", for the discrimination of all living species on the planet. This system was called 

DNA Barcodes and consists of the amplification of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase 

I (COI) gene, has a greater number of phylogenetically informative sites in relation to other 

mitochondrial genes (KNOWLTON; WEIGT, 1998). 



33 
 

Takeuchi et al. (2015), sequenced by the first time the mitochondrial genome of 

myxosporeans and observed that Kudoa mitochondrial genome are divergent from other 

metazoans, suggesting that the mitochondrial of Myxozoa is, in general, potentially divergent. 

 

1.7 Mitochondrial organelles of myxosporeans 

Myxosporeans were first reported in 1825 infecting Coregonus fera from Lake Geneva 

as threats for fish due to cysts proliferation in the musculature of the host (JURINE,1825). Since 

then, these parasites have become aim of interest of researchers (MLADINEO et al., 2010) and 

the increasing knowledge of new species, as well other studies has allowed to understading 

better the morphology, parasite-host relationship, evolution and biology of the myxosporeans 

(ALAMA-BERMEJO et al., 2011; OKAMURA et al., 2015). 

The technological advances of transmission electron microscopy allowed new insights 

on functional biology and cytological features of myxosporeans (OKAMURA et al., 2015). 

Some these studies documented developmental stages and while other focused on features of 

the constituents such as pinocytotic vesicles, microvilli, Golgi complexes and mitochondria 

(LOM; DYKOVÁ, 1992). 

Mitochondria are cytoplasmatic organelles existing in practically all types of eukaryotic 

cells vegetables and animals (NICHOLLS; FERGUSON, 2002), in number proportional to the 

metabolic activity of each one, being then variable in the different cells, and, also, it is the 

primary source of hightly energetic compost in the cell (BEAL, 2005; BRAND; NICHOLLS, 

2011).   

In myxosporeans, mitochondria are presents in greater numbers in the periphery of 

plasmodia which high levels of pinocytotic activity (FEIST et al., 2015). Transformations of 

mitochondrial organelles are associated with not yet understood changes in metabolic activity 

and ion traffic at different stages of development of the myxosporeans and, in addition, there is 



34 
 

a great variability in the density of mitochondrial matrix and in the shape of cristae (LOM; 

DYKOVÁ, 1996). Just like the process sporogenesis also appears to follow a pattern observed 

in many myxosporean species, with the early stages of myxospore formation in the plasmodial 

periphery and mature myxospores located in the central part of the plasmodia (CURRENT et 

al., 1979; CASAL et al., 2002; ADRIANO et al., 2006).  

Typically, myxospores are physiologically inactive, usually relatively immobile and 

rigid (FEIST et al., 2015) and are more resistant which malacospores and actinospores, being 

able to withstand extremes in temperature, desiccation and extended dormancy (HALLET; 

BARTHOLOMEW, 2012). 

To understand the role of mitochondria in Kudoa myxospores, Takeuchi et al. (2015) 

observed in vivo the aerobic respiration, metabolism, and structure of the mitochondria, besides 

of the mitochondrial genome. The authors found eight proteins involved in the oxidative 

phosphorylation and, the aerobic respiration was observed, with fluorescent dye which detects 

proton gradients in the mitochondria, next to the polar capsules, suggesting that the aerobic 

respiration must to occur therein and is necessary to measure the acvitiy of each complex of 

oxidative phosphorylation for understading of the cellular respiration in myxosporeans.

4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

4.1 General Methodology 

This project was linked to the project “Systematics and parasite-host interaction of 

parasites of Myxozoa subphylum in fish of economic importance of the Amazon Basin” of the 

Prof. Dr. Edson Aparecido Adriano, process FAPESP: 2013/21374-6 and was developed in the 

laboratory of Immunology of Parasites (LIP), of the Department of Veterinary Medicine,  of 

the Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of São Paulo, FZEA/USP, 

Pirassununga – SP, in partnership with Department of Ecology and Evolution Biology, Federal 

University of São Paulo – UNIFESP, Campus Diadema – SP; Department of Biochemistry and 

Cell Morphology of the Institute of Biology IB/UNICAMP, Campinas, SP. 

4.1.1 Samples collection 

The collections were performed in the Amazon basin, in the Tapajós and Solimões 

rivers, Santarém, PA and Manacapuru, AM, respectively (Figures 1 A – B).

Boats were used to reach the site collection (Figure 2A). Fish were caught (SISBIO nº 

44268-4 and SisGen nº A33CB83) using boats and nets and kept in captivity (Figure 2B and C) 

until they were transported alive (Figure 2D) to the field laboratory (Figure 2E), mounted in the 

proximity of the collection point. After euthanasia, by transection of the spinal cord (Figure 

2F), methodology approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Animal Science and 

Food Engineering, FZEA/USP, Process USP: 14.1.391.74-9 (ATTACHMENT B), the fish 

were weighed and measured (Figure 2G) and, subsequently, a necropsy was performed with 

exposure of the gills and visceral cavity, in order to detect the presence of parasites or cysts 

(Figure 2H). Fragments of tissues of the host fish containing plasmodia were collected and fixed 

in formaldehyde and absolute ethanol, respectively, for morphological and molecular analyses.

4.1.2 Molecular characterization of host fish 

The correct identification of the host fish was performed through the amplification of 

the ?-tropomyosin gene.  The tissue of the fish infected with plasmodium was macerated in a 

slide and collected in 1,5 mL microtubes for DNA extraction.  



43 
 

DNA from the tissues infected of the collected fish was extracted with the DNeasy® 

Blood &amp;amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

DNA extracted was quantified in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, 

Wilmington, USA) at 260 nm. 

The amplification and sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin gene of the specimens of fish 

infected was performed according to Hashimoto et al. (2011), using the primer pair TROPF and 

TROPR (Table 1) and the product obtained was sent for sequencing. The obtained sequences 

were submitted to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool nucleotide (BLASTn) analysis of the 

GenBank database (ALTSCHUL et al.,1990). 

4.1.3 Morphologic analyses 

Myxosporean cysts (Figure 3A) fized in formaldehyde were carefully separated from 

the host tissue and individually ruptured (Figure 3B) in glass slides. The released myxospores 

(Figure 3B) were analyzed under light microscopy and then photographed. The myxosporean 

species were identified and measured according to the criteria established by Lom and Arthur 

(1989). The slides were then fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa to be deposited in 

the collection of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of 

Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.

To characterize the species, the morphological characteristics of mature myxospores 

were analyzed, such as: myxospore shape and structure, polar capsule form, myxospore 

projections or caudal appendages, size relation between polar capsules, relative position of the 

anterior end of the polar capsules, position of sporoplasm in the spore cavity, dimensions of 

myxospores, variability of shape and size of myxospores. These data were obtained by light 

microscope coupled to a computer equipped with the Axivision 4.1 image capture program. 

4.1.4 Molecular analyses 

After capturing images, the slides containing myxospores were washed with PBS buffer 

and the myxospores were collected in sterile 1.5 mL microtubes for DNA extraction. 

DNA extraction 

DNA from the isolated samples was extracted with the DNeasy® Blood &amp;amp; Tissue kit 

(Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions and was quantified 

in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) at 260 nm. 

 

 



45 
 

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 

All PCR were performed with final volume of 25 µL, containing 10-50 ng genomic 

DNA, 12.5 µL of 2 × DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, 

USA), 0.2 µM of each primer and free water of nucleases (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, 

California, USA). For genes amplification, two specific pairs of primers were used, some them 

designed for this study (Table 1, Figure 4). A ProFlex PCR Systems (Applied BiosystemsTM 

Inc., California, USA) thermocycler with specific program were used to each gene (Table 2).

All PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer 

(EDTA Tris-Acetate: Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 mM, EDTA 1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe 

DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) and analyzed in Light Emitting 

Diode (LED) transilluminator (Kasvi, Paraná, Brazil). The size of the amplified fragments was 

estimated by comparison to the standard 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, 

California, USA). 

 The PCR products were then purified using the QIAquick PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., 

California, USA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The purified product was 

quantified in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and compared to Low DNA Mass (Thermo 

Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA). 

 Sequencing 

The sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with primers specific for 

each gene (Table 1), in the ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, 



47 
 

USA), using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., 

California, USA). 

 The obtained sequences were then visualized, edited and aligned in the program BioEdit 

7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) using the algorithm ClustalW (THOMPSON, 1994), forming a 

consensus sequence for each sample. Each consensus sequence was submitted to BLASTn 

(ALTSCHUL et al., 1990) analysis for the search for similarity in the GenBank database 

National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

 4.1.5 Phylogenetic analyses 

 For the phylogenetic analyses, alignments were performed with sequences of 

myxosporeans deposited in GenBank database by the algorithm ClustalW (THOMPSON et al., 

1994) coupled to the program BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999).  

 The maximum likelihood method was performed by the PhyML 3.0 program 

(GUINDON et al., 2010), with automatic model selection by Smart Model Selection (SMS) and 

bootstrap value of 1000 repetitions. The resulting trees were visualized in the FigTree 1.3.1 

program (RAMBAUT, 2008) and edited with Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, 

USA). 

 The p-distance analysis was performed by the MEGA 7.0 software (KUMAR; 

STECHER; TAMURA, 2016) to compare the genetic differences among the species studied 

with other myxosporeans species of the GenBank database. 

 Host fish data, such as family and/or order, were obtained from the FishBase website 

(FROESE; PAULY, 2018).

4.2 Supplementary Methodology 

Due to the availability of material and the willingness to enrich the data of this study, 

histological and electron microscopy analyses were performed for some samples. Microscopy 

fluorescence was perfomed to observe the behavior in vivo of mitochondria in Henneguya spp. 

4.2.1 Histologic analyses 

For histologic analyses, fragments containing plasmodia were fixed in buffered 10% 

formalin for 24h and placed in paraffin. Sections of 4 µm thickness were then stained with 

hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed in Leica DM 1000 Microscope coupled with Leica EC3 

camera and LAS EZ image capture software. 

4.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy analyses 

For transmission electron microscopy, small fragments of infected tissue were fixed in 

2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 12h, washed in glucose-

saline solution for 2h and fixed in OsO4 for 4h. After, these samples were dehydrated in 

increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Embed 812 resin. Uranyl acetate citrate 

was used to treat ultrathin sections that, posteriorly, were examined in a LEO 906 transmission 

electron microscope operating at 60 kV (UNICAMP). 

4.2.3 Fluorescence Microscopy analyses 

 Live myxospores were collected of fins of Astyanax altiparanae in a fish farm and kept 

in microtube containing PBS. Spores were centrifuged and stained with MitoTracker Orange® 

(Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 

dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) and visualized in 

inverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic camera Axio Can 503. 

 The results of this work are divided in four chapters, which generated two articles. The 

first one already published and the second sent for publication. The third chapter refers to results 



49 
 

obtained by undergraduated Caroline Munhoz Meira. The fourth chapter refers to studies of the 

COI gene and fluorescence microscopy in myxosporeans.  

 Specific methodologies are described in each chapter.

CHAPTER 1. THE RESOLUTION OF THE TAXONOMIC DILEMMA OF Myxobolus 

colossomatis AND DESCRIPTION OF TWO NOVEL MYXOSPOREANS SPECIES OF 

Colossoma macropomum FROM THE AMAZON BASIN 

 

ABSTRACT 

This study presents morphologic, molecular and phylogenetic data about two new species of 

the genus Myxobolus and of the previously described Myxobolus colossomatis, all which are 

found infecting the Colossoma macropomum, a fish whose natural habitat is the Amazon Basin 

of Brazil, from where the specimens for this study were caught. A total of 51 C. macropomum 

specimens were examined between October of 2014 and January of 2016. Plasmodia of the 

myxosporeans were found infecting several organs: Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2 

were respectively found in the inner face of the operculum and in the wall external surface of 

the stomach, intestine and gill arch. Myxobolus n. sp. 1 were 9.6 ± 0.4 µm in length, 7.0 ± 0.3 

µm in width and 5.0±0.3 µm in thickness of the myxospore. Myxobolus n. sp. 2 measured 19.1 

± 0.4 µm in length, 9.4 ± 0.3 µm in width and 8.3±0.4 µm in thickness. The polar capsules, 

which were elongated, showed 4.3 ± 0.4 µm in length and 1.9 ± 0.1 µm in width for Myxobolus 

n. sp. 1 and 10.5 ± 0.2 µm in length and 2.5 ± 0.1 µm in width for Myxobolus n. sp. 2. Myxobolus 

colossomatis had two myxospores morphotypes: 1) Ellipsoidal myxospores measuring 11.6 ± 

0.4 µm in length and 7.6 ± 0.2 µm in width. Their elongated polar capsules measured 5.6 ± 0.2 

µm in length and 2.5 ± 0.2 µm in width; 2) Oval myxospores measuring 10.4 ± 0.5 µm in length 

and 7.7 ± 0.3 µm in width. Their polar capsules were 5.4 ± 0.2 µm in length and 2.4 ± 0.0 µm 

in width. The number of coils of the polar filament was 7-8 coils. The molecular comparison of 

ssrDNA showed a genetic divergence of 10.3% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and M. 

colossomatis, 22.4% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, and 23.2% between 

Myxobolus n. sp. 2 and M. colossomatis. Myxobolus cf. colossomatis, a parasite of Piaractus 



61 
 

mesopotamicus, showed 11.1% of genetic divergence to M. colossomatis, demonstrating them 

to be a distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis, based on sequences of the ssrDNA, showed the 

Myxobolus n. sp. 1 to be a sister species of M. colossomatis, and it also showed Myxobolus n. 

sp. 2 to be a sister branch in the lineage composed by Myxobolus cf. cuneus and Henneguya 

pellucida. 

 

Keywords: Myxobolus; Myxobolus colossomatis; ssrDNA sequencing; phylogeny; prevalence. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, is a serrasalmid fish commonly known in Brazil 

as tambaqui. It is considered the second largest scaled fish from Amazon River Basin, and in 

its natural environment it may reach up to 100 cm long and weigh 30 kg (NAKATANI et al., 

2001). Tambaqui is the most cultivated species in the Brazilian Amazon (GOMES et al., 2010; 

LOPERA-BARRERO et al., 2011) and one of the most important species in Brazilian 

aquaculture. Almost 60.000t were marketed in 2010, with 4.200t caught by fishing and 54.300t 

harvested from fish farms (MPA, 2012). Colossoma macropomum is also important when it is 

crossbred in fish farms with other serrasalmids species, such as the Piaractus mesopotamicus 

Holmberg, 1887, which results in a hybrid called tambacu, or with the Piaractus brachypomus 

Cuvier, 1818, which results in the hybrid tambatinga. These produced around 21.600t and 

5.000t respectively in 2010 (MPA, 2012).  

 Due to its economic importance as one of the most important species of the amazonic 

icthyofauna (GOULDING; CARVALHO, 1982), C. macropomum has been targeted for the 

study of several parasitic infections, including those of the myxosporeans. Myxosporea is a 

morphologically and biologically diverse group of parasite cnidarians that cause diseases and 

threaten fish in their natural habitats and in fish farms in various parts of the world. They are 



62 
 

also responsible for high mortality rates in some species and are associated with ecological and 

economic impacts (LOM; DYKOVÁ, 2006; ELWELL et al., 2009; FIALA; BARTOŠOVÁ, 

2010). Despite the importance of C. macropomum, only Myxobolus colossomatis Molnár and 

Békési, 1993 and Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 have so far been 

described in this iconic Amazon fish. In this study, however, morphologic and small subunit 

ribosomal DNA (ssrDNA) sequencing data were obtained from M. colossomatis and of two 

new Myxobolus Bütschli, 1882 species found parasitizing tambaqui in the Amazon River Basin, 

Brazil, and a phylogenetic analysis is also provided. 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Specimens of C. macropomum were caught (SISBIO nº 44268-4 and SisGen nº 

A33CB83) in the Tapajós River in the municipality of Santarém, Pará State (N = 35) and also 

in the Solimões River in the municipality of Manacapuru, Amazônia State (N = 16), both in the 

Brazilian Amazon. The fish were caught using nets and/or hooks and taken alive to a field 

laboratory near their point of collection. Before the examination, the fish were euthanized with 

spinal transection methodology approved by the ethics research committee of the University de 

São Paulo – Process USP 14.1.391.74.9 (ATTACHMENT B) measured, necropsied and 

examined for myxosporeans.  

 

2.1 Morphological analyses 

Myxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and individually 

ruptured in glass slides. A total of 30 mature myxospores were analyzed in a light microscope, 

photographed and measured according Lom and Arthur (1989). The dimensions of the 

myxospores are expressed as mean ± standard deviation in µm. These slides were then fixed 



63 
 

with methanol and stained with Giemsa to be deposited in the collection of the Adão José 

Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. 

 

2.2 Molecular analyses 

SsrDNA analyses were performed in the samples of myxospores and taxonomic and 

phylogenetic studies were initiated. The ?-tropomyosin gene of the host were sequenced from 

host tissue aiming the correct host identification of the fish.  

The DNA of each sample was extracted separately with DNeasy® Blood &amp;amp; Tissue kit 

(Qiagen Inc., California, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were 

performed with a final volume of 25 µL containing 10 - 50 ng of genomic DNA, DreamTaq 

12.5 µL of 2 × PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 µM of 

each specific primer and nuclease free water (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA). 

For ssrDNA amplification, primer pairs ERIB1 (BARTA et al., 1997) with ACT1R (HALLET; 

DIAMANT, 2001) and TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2015) with ERIB10 (BARTA et al., 

1997) were used. The amplifications of the ?-tropomyosin gene were performed using the 

primer pair TROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999) in accordance with Hashimoto et al. 

(2011), followed by modifications. A ProFlex PCR Systems thermocycler (Applied 

BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) was utilized for amplification of the genes with a program 

as follows: ssrDNA (initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles: 95°C for 60 s, 60°C 

for 60 s and 72°C for 90 s; final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes), ?-tropomyosin (35 cycles: 

95°C for 30 s, 64°C for 30 s and 72°C for 10 s). All PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% 

agarose gel electrophoresis in a TAE buffer (Tris–Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 

mM, EDTA 1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, 

California, USA), and analyzed in a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paraná, Brazil). The sizes of 

the amplified fragments were estimated by comparison with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder 



64 
 

(Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA). The PCR products were purified using the 

QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) and sequenced using the same 

primer pairs used in the reaction, as well as the additional primers for sequencing of ssrDNA: 

BOBF 5'-TGTTACAGCATGGAACGAAC-3' (Present study); MC5 and MC3 (MOLNÁR et 

al., 2002), in order to overlap the fragments obtained. Sequencing of all samples was performed 

using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., 

California, USA) and an ABI 3730 DNA sequencing analyzer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., 

California, USA).  

The DNA sequences obtained were visualized and assembled using BioEdit 7.1.3.0 

(HALL, 1999) software and compared with other myxozoans sequences available in the NCBI 

database using BLASTn (ALTSCHUL et al., 1997) for confirmation of myxozoans and C. 

macropomum DNA.  

 

2.3 Phylogenetic analysis 

The alignment was performed using the closest myxozoans sequences to each one of the 

species here studied, based on GenBank data by BLASTn. The sequences of the ssrDNA of 

myxosporeans were obtained from the NCBI database, and a total of 31 sequences of 

Henneguya species, 45 of Myxobolus species and one of Thelohanellus Kudo, 1933 species 

were inserted in the analysis. Ceratomyxa amazonensis Mathews, Naldoni, Maia and Adriano, 

2016 and Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 were chosen as the outgroup. 

All sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON et al., 1994) by 

software BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999).  

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood method in PhyML 

software (GUINDON et al. 2010), with NNI search, automatic model selection by SMS, under 

a GTR + G + I substitution model (with four categories), equilibrium frequencies optimized, 



65 
 

transition/transversion ratio estimated, proportion of in-variable sites estimated (0.246) and 

gamma shape parameter estimated (0.533). Bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) was employed 

to assess the relative robustness of the tree branches.  

The phylogenetic tree was viewed using FigTree v1.3.1 (RAMBAUT, 2008) and edited 

with Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, USA). The pairwise method, with the p-

distance model (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, 2016), was carried out in the MEGA 7.0 

software to compare the genetic differences of the ssrDNA sequences among the focus species 

of this study with Myxobolus spp. of other serrasalmids fish. The data of the host fishes, as 

family and/or order, were obtained from FishBase web site (FROESE; PAULY, 2017). 

 

2.4. Statistical analysis 

The G test (with Williams correction) was performed with the BioEstat 5.0 (AYRES et 

al., 2000); it had a level of significance set at p &amp;lt;0.05 and was used to compare if there were 

any significant differences of the prevalence among the Myxobolus species and the places of 

study. 

 

RESULTS 

 

Epidemiologic data 

In addition to the morphological identification of all the hosts, this study also provided 

the identification of three tambaqui specimens by the sequencing of ?-tropomyosin and 

comparison with GenBank data by BLASTn.  

Three Myxobolus species were found infecting C. macropomum specimens in this study. 

Of the total of 51 tambaqui sampled, 35 (68.6%) had infections by at least one of these 

Myxobolus species. Myxobolus colossomatis was observed in 6.2% (1/16) of the fish examined

in Amazonas State and in 17.1% (6/35) in the Pará State. These prevalence did not differ 

significantly (G test = 1.14, df = 1). The parasite was found in several organs, such as the fin, 

pyloric cecum, gill arch and abdominal cavity. Two of the three Myxobolus species were 

unknown myxosporeans, and are below described: Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was found infecting the 

inner surface of the operculum, with prevalence of 6.2% (1/16) in Amazonas State and 5.7% 

(2/35) in Pará State, and these prevalence did not differ significantly between (G test = 0.004, 

df = 1); Myxobolus n. sp. 2 was observed parasitizing the external wall of the stomach, intestine 

and epithelium of the gill arch. The prevalence was of 8.5% (3/35) in Pará State and this species 

was not found in Amazonas State. The comparison of the total prevalence among each one of 

the three Myxobolus species studied showed that there were not significant differences (G test 

= 2.76, df = 2). 

 

  Taxonomic data 

Myxobolus n. sp. 1 (Figures 5-6, A) 

Description: plasmodia white and ~ 0.1 mm were found in the inner surface of the 

operculum of C. macropomum. Mature myxospores were ellipsoid in frontal view (Figure 5A), 

measuring 9.6 ± 0.4 (9.1 to 10.8) µm in length, 7.0 ± 0.3 (6.5 to 7.6) µm in width and biconvex 

in lateral view, with 5.0 ± 0.3 (4.6 to 5.5) µm in thickness and valves symmetric. The polar 

capsules elongated and were equal in size, measuring 4.3 ± 0.4 (3.3 to 5.0) µm in length and 

1.9 ± 0.1 (1.6 to 2.2) µm in width, and occupying half of the spore body length (Figure 5A). It 

was not possible to count the number of coils of the polar tubules by light microscopy (Table 

3).

Type host: Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. 

Localities of collection: Solimões and Tapajós Rivers, municipality of Manacapuru, 

Amazonas State and Santarém, Pará State, respectively, Brazil. 

Prevalence: 3 of 51 (5.9%). 

Site of infection:  Inner surface of the operculum. 

Type of material: Slides stained with myxospores were deposited in the collections of 

the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), 

Brazil (accession number ZUEC – MYX89). 

Molecular data: Partial sequence, with 1956 bp of the ssrDNA were deposited in 

GenBank under the accession number MK032219.

Remarks: Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was compared with all species of Myxobolus known to 

infect freshwater fish from South America and other continents (EIRAS et al., 2005, 2014), and 

also with the other new species described in this study. Initially, the comparison was done with 

parasite species of C. macropomum. Myxobolus n. sp. 1 differs in some morphological and 

morphometric aspect as length and width of the body, length and width of the polar capsules 

and thickness in comparison to Myxobolus n. sp. 2 and M. colossomatis (Table 3). Of the species 

found infecting other fishes of the Serrasalmidae family, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 presented 

measurements closest with M. cf. colossomatis, a parasite of Piaractus mesopotamicus, to 

which this new species was similar in length and width of the polar capsules (respectively: 

4.3/1.9 for Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and 4.4/1.8 for M. cf. colossomatis), but the body shape differed 

in the anterior extremity, once Myxobolus n. sp. 1 presented rounded anterior end and M. cf. 

colossomatis exhibited tapered anterior end. In comparing the Myxobolus with parasite species 

of other hosts, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 differed in morphometric/morphological features in at least 

one of the following properties: the size and/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, the 

number of polar tubules coils, the site of infection, and region of occurrence (EIRAS 2002; 

EIRAS; ADRIANO 2012). 

The ssrDNA sequencing of Myxobolus n. sp. 1 resulted in a partial sequence of 1956 

bp, which did not match with any myxosporeans sequences available in GenBank database. 

Analysis of the genetic similarity of the myxosporean parasites of serrassalmid fish showed that 

the closest species to Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was Myxobolus colossomatis (Present study) with a 

10.3% of difference (Table 4). Thus, based on morphological and molecular data, Myxobolus 

n. sp. 1 is proposed to be a new taxon.

Myxobolus n. sp. 2 (Figures 5-6, B) 

Description: White plasmodia measuring ~ 0.2 mm were found in the external wall of 

the stomach, intestine and gill arch of C. macropomum. Mature myxospores were elongated 

(Figure 5B), measuring 19.1 ± 0.4 (18.0 to 20.0) µm in length, 9.4±0.3 (8.6 to 10.4) µm in 

width, biconvex in lateral view, with 8.3 ± 0.4 (7.6 to 8.9) µm in thickness. Polar capsules 

elongated with equal size, measuring 10.5 ± 0.2 (9.7 to 11.1) µm in length and 2.5 ± 0.1 (2.1 to 

2.8) µm in width, occupied a little more than half the body of the myxospores. Polar tubules 

with 9 to 10 coils were arranged perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the polar capsule 

(Figure 5B, Table 3). 

Type host: Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. 

Locality: Tapajós River, municipality of Santarém, Pará State, Brazil. 

Prevalence: 3 of 51 (5.9%). 

Sites of infection: The external wall of the stomach, intestine and gill arch. 

Type of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the collections of 

the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), 

Brazil (accession number ZUEC – MYX90). 

Molecular data: Partial sequence with 1945 bp of the ssrDNA were deposited in 

GenBank under the accession number MK032221. 

Remarks: Myxobolus n. sp. 2 was also compared with all species of Myxobolus that 

infect freshwater fish of the South America and other continents (EIRAS et al., 2005, 2014). 

Myxobolus myleus Azevedo, Clemente, Casal, Matos, Alves, Al-Quraishy and Matos, 2012, a 

parasite also of the Amazon serrasalmid Myleus rubripinnis, presented similar dimensions of 

the myxospores body length (19.3 for M. myleus and 19.1 for Myxobolus n. sp. 2), but differed 

in the body shape when viewed frontally; M. myleus exhibited a lightly-tapered anterior end 

and pear-shaped myxospores. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the molecular 



71 
 

comparison between these two species, since the M. myleus description was based on only 

morphological data. Myxobolus cf. cuneus (MILANIN et al., 2015), a parasite of hybrid 

serrasalmids, presented the same number of coils of the polar filaments [9-10] (Table 3), but 

these two species differed in the morphology, since M. cf. cuneus presented a pyriform shape, 

while Myxobolus n. sp. 2 presented an ellipsoidal shape. Comparing Myxobolus species 

parasites of other hosts, this new species differed in morphometric/morphological features at 

least in one of the properties, such as size and/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, 

number of polar tubules coils, site of infection and region of occurrence (EIRAS 2002; EIRAS; 

ADRIANO 2012). The ssrDNA sequencing of Myxobolus n. sp. 2 resulted in a partial sequence 

of 1945 bp, which did not match to any myxosporean sequences available in GenBank database. 

In the genetic similarity analysis of the myxosporeans parasites of serralmids fish Myxobolus 

n. sp. 2, the closest species was M. cf. cuneus with a 14.8% of difference (Table 4). The 

morphological and molecular data support the creating of the new taxon.  

 

Myxobolus colossomatis Molnár and Békési, 1993 (Figures 5-6, C) 

Morphological characteristics:  White plasmodia, measuring ~ 0.1 mm and containing 

innumerous mature and immature myxospores were found in different organs, such as pyloric 

cecum, skin and gill arch. The majority of the mature myxospores were ellipsoidal in frontal 

view (Figure 5C), measuring 11.6 ± 0.4 (10.8 to 12.3) µm in length and 7.6 ± 0.2 (7.2 to 8.1) 

µm in width. Polar capsules elongated and were of equal size, measuring 5.6 ± 0.2 (5.0 to 5.9) 

µm of length and 2.5 ± 0.2 (2.2 to 3.4) µm of width and occupying little more than half of the 

spore. A few myxospores had oval shape (with slightly narrower anterior region), measuring 

10.4 ± 0.5 (9.6 to 10.8) µm in length, 7.7 ± 0.3 (7.3 to 8.0) µm in width. The polar capsules 

were elongated and with equal size, measuring 5.4 ± 0.2 (5.1 to 5.7) µm in length and 2.4 ± 0.0 

(2.3 to 2.4) µm in width (Table 3). The polar tubules had 7 to 8 coils.

Host: Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. 

Localities of collection: Solimões and Tapajós Rivers, municipality of Manacapuru, 

Amazonas State and Santarém, Pará State, respectively, Brazil. 

Prevalence: 7 of 51 (13.7%). 

Sites of infection: Liver, spleen, pyloric cecum, fin, wall intestinal, digestive tract and 

gill arch. 

Material deposited: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the collections 

of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas 

(UNICAMP), Brazil (accession number ZUEC – MYX 91). 

Molecular data: Partial sequence with 1936 bp of the ssrDNA were deposited in 

GenBank under the accession number MK032220.  

Remarks:  The morphological and morphometric data of the Myxobolus species were 

found parasitizing the pyloric cecum, skin and gill arch of C. colossomatis from the Amazon 

and concurred to those of the M. colossomatis originally described by Molnár and Békési (1993) 

(Table 3). The ssrDNA sequencing of M. colossomatis performed in this study resulted in a 

partial sequence of 1936 bp, which did not match to any myxosporean sequences available in 

GenBank database or in the genetic similarity analysis. Considering parasite species of 

serrasalmids, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was the closest related species to M. colossomatis, with 10.3% 

of difference (Table 4).

Phylogenetic analysis  

Maximum likelihood analyses, based on the ssrDNA sequences of the 

myxosporeans species most closely related to each of the species studied here and, 

according to BLASTn, with well-supported bootstrap, showed that Myxobolus n. sp. 1 

appears as sister species to M. colossomatis, in a subclade that also are present M. cf. 

colossomatis, parasite of P. mesopotamicus and Myxobolus macroplasmodialis Molnár, 

Ranzani-Paiva, Eiras and Rodrigues (1998), parasite of the bryconid Salminus 

brasiliensis. Myxobolus n. sp. 2 appears, with low bootstrap support, in a lineage 

composed by three species parasites of South American serrasalmids fish (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION 

Based on morphological/morphometric and sequencing of the ssrDNA, this study 

described two novel species of genus Myxobolus and provided molecular data for M. 



76 
 

 

colossomatis. All these were found parasitizing C. macropomum in its natural habitat of 

the Amazon Basin.  

The BLASTn search was conducted for each ssrDNA sequences obtained in this 

study to confirm amplification of myxozoan DNA, and no close matches to any 

myxosporeans sequences available in GenBank. The p-distance analysis displayed 

genetic divergences of 10.3% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and M. colossomatis, 22.4% 

between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, and 23.2% between Myxobolus n. 

sp. 2 and M. colossomatis. This demonstrates that, in its natural habitat, C. macropomum 

harbors at least three distinct Myxobolus species, two of which were hitherto unknown. 

The third parasite, M. colossomatis, had already been described by Molnár and Békési 

(1993) to infect gills, fins, liver, heart, muscle and intestines of farmed specimens from 

Ceará State, in the Brazil’s Northeast, although molecular data were not provided. Later, 

in a search for myxosporeans in farmed fish in São Paulo State in Brazil’s Southeast, 

Martins et al. (1999) reported the occurrence M. colossomatis in the kidney of C. 

macropomum, but these authors also identified the occurrence of this same parasite in 

kidney, liver, spleen and gallbladder of P. mesopotamicus, another serrasalmid fish 

popularly known as “pacu”, but whose the natural distribution is restricted to La Plata 

River Basin (LIMA et al. 2003). In studies carried out in the natural environment of 

Brazil’s Pantanal wetlands (a part of the La Plata Basin) Adriano et al. (2002) and Campos 

et al. (2008) also referred to a Myxobolus species and reported specimens of P. 

mesopotamicus as M. colossomatis; however, these authors, (MARTINS et al.,1999), did 

not display morphometric and molecular data, thus leaving the real taxonomic position of 

the studied parasites inconclusive. Müller et al. (2013), studying myxosporeans of farmed 

P. mesopotamicus, in São Paulo State, found gills infected by a Myxobolus sp. whose 

spores resembled that of the M. colossomatis described by Molnár and Békési (1993), but 



77 
 

 

in addition to morphometric data, the authors also performed ultrastructure and ssrDNA 

sequencing. Because the myxospores morphologic/morphometric data had very few 

differences to those of the original description of M. colossomatis (Table 1), and as there 

was no molecular data for comparison, Müller et al. (2013) preferred to call it Myxobolus 

cf. colossomatis and wait for the availability of ssrDNA sequences of M. colossomatis 

obtained from the host type before defining it as the same species.  Notably, this study 

now reveals a Myxobolus species found infecting pyloric cecum, skin and gill arch of 

specimens of C. macropomum caught in its natural habitat (Amazon Basin), and in which 

morphologic/morphometric data and biological traits have matched those reported by 

Molnár and Békési (1993), in their original descriptions. Hence, this parasite has been 

identified as M. colossomatis, and this has finally provided the ssrDNA sequence of this 

parasite from the host type, settling the taxonomic dilemma. The ssrDNA sequence of M. 

colossomatis showed 11.1% of genetic divergence to that of M. cf. colossomatis found 

by Müller et al. (2013). It was discovered parasitizing farmed P. mesopotamicus in São 

Paulo State and thus demonstrates that this is an unnamed species waiting for a name. 

However, despite the fact that naturally C. macropomum and P. mesopotamicus 

inhabit distinct watersheds and fish farms, these two species are farmed throughout 

Brazil, and in some regions, they are crossed bred to obtain a hybrid fish called 

“tambacu,” which is largely accepted by consumers. It is therefore not possible to ensure 

that in these conditions the Myxobolus species do not circulate between C. macropomum 

and P. mesopotamicus, or even between their hybrids. 

In the phylogenetic analysis, the three Myxobolus parasite species of C. 

macropomum were not monophyletic, with the strong likelihood that Myxobolus n. sp. 1 

and M. colossomatis appear to be sister species in a lineage. Also, the M. cf. colossomatis, 

provided by Muller et al. (2013). Myxobolus n. sp. 2 (albeit with low bootstrap support), 



78 
 

 

appears in a sister branch of the lineage composed by Henneguya pellucida Adriano, 

Arana and Cordeiro (2005) and Myxobolus cf. cuneus; both parasites are also of the 

serrassalmid P. mesopotamicus.  

In addition to the taxonomic and phylogenetic data above provided, this study also 

introduces and provides data about the prevalence of the Myxobolus species. Considering 

the two regions that were sampled, it was possible to observe that in cases of M. 

colossomatis and Myxobolus n. sp. 1, which were reported in both places, the prevalence 

did not differ significantly. In the same way, no significant difference was observed when 

compared to the prevalence among the three Myxobolus species found. Additionally, 

these data show, that despite being low, the prevalence was similar to the different regions 

and species, except with the Myxobolus n. sp. 2, which was absent in Amazonas state. 

This absence may, however, be related to the lower sampling in this region. 

In summary, this study provided data on the prevalence, morphology, molecular 

and phylogeny of two new species of Myxobolus and of M. colossomatis, and it clarified 

the taxonomic context of the latter. Further to this, our data reinforce the suggestions of 

Kent et al. (2001), Lom and Dyková (2006) and Fiala et al. (2015), that the association of 

morphological and molecular data are fundamental to avoid taxonomic confusion in 

myxosporeans.

CHAPTER 2. NOVEL MYXOSPOREAN SPECIES PARASITES OF Piaractus 

brachypomus, AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FISH FROM THE AMAZON 

BASIN 

 

ABSTRACT 

Myxosporeans are a group of parasitic cnidarians, with severe pathogeny of some species. 

This paper describes two new species of myxobolid found infecting specimens of 

Piaractus brachypomus arising from the Amazon basin, Brazil, based on morphology, 

histology, ultrastructural and phylogeny analysis. The fish were caught in the Tapajós 

river Santarém, PA, Brazil. The plasmodial development of Henneguya n. sp. 1 was 

intralamellar and of Myxobolus n. sp. 3 was in the pyloric cecum according with 

histological analysis. For both species was observed no inflammatory infiltrate. For 

Henneguya n. sp. 1 mature myxospores were ellipsoidal measuring: 13.07 ± 0.5 µm in 

length, 4.3 ± 0.2 µm in width, 3.8 ± 0.2 µm in thickness. The polar capsules were 

elongated measuring 6.3 ± 0.5 µm in length and 1.6 ± 0.2 µm in width, each containing 

polar filament with 4 coils. The caudal process was greater than the length of the body, 

measuring 44.7 ± 3.0 µm and the total length of the myxospore was 57.5 ± 3.5 µm. 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 showed rounded mature myxospores measuring: 10.4 ± 0.3 µm in 

length, 7.2 ± 0.1 µm in width and 5.8 ± 0.2 µm of the thickness. The polar capsules were 

equal size and occupied less than half the myxospore, measuring: 3.8 ± 0.1 µm in length 

and 2.6 ± 0.1 µm in width, each containing polar filament with 6-7 coils. Phylogenetic 

analysis, based on partial ssrDNA sequences and using the closest myxosporean 

sequences to each one of the species here studied, showed that Henneguya n. sp. 1. 

clustered in a well-supported smaller subclade composed by Henneguya species that 



85 
 

 

infect gills of the serrasalmid hosts, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustered in a subclade composed 

only for Myxobolus species parasite of the different organs. 

 

Key-words: Myxobolus, Henneguya, Tapajós river, pirapitinga, ssrDNA. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Myxozoans are widespread cnidarian endoparasites and diverse and important 

components for ecosystems. They have a complex life-cycle which involves annelids and 

bryozoans as definitive invertebrate hosts and mainly fish, but also other vertebrates, as 

intermediate hosts (OKAMURA et al., 2015). Phylogenetic DNA studies have shown that 

the Myxobolus lineage (Myxobolus/Henneguya) is the largest within the myxozoan class 

(FIALA et al., 2015, Chapter 5), with around 850 Myxobolus and 200 Henneguya species 

described, representing almost half the diversity of these cnidaria subphyla. However, 

only 100 species (around 10%) have been reported infecting South American fish species 

(EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012; EIRAS et al., 2014; ADRIANO; OLIVEIRA, 2019). 

The Amazon basin is approximately 6.500 km2 in size, and is one of the most 

productive and intact ecosystems on the planet. Due to its abundant water, it harbors vast 

fish diversity (VAL; HONCZARYK, 1995; GOULDING, 1996; SANTOS; SANTOS, 

2005). The native fish Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818, popularly known in Brazil 

as “pirapitinga”, which occurs in the Amazon and Orinoco basins and can reach a weight 

of up to 20 kg and a length of up to 80 cm (SOBRINHO et al., 1984; MPA, 2013; 

FROESE; PAULY, 2018), is economically important for the region. Due to the high 

quality of its meat and rapid growth, the species is widely farmed in South America, and 

has also been used in fish farming in Asia (FRESNEDA et al., 2004; HONGLANG, 2007; 

FLORES NOVA, 2007; LIN et al., 2015). In Brazil, P. brachypomus is among the largest 



86 
 

 

native fish species farmed, and is also important for crossing with other native species to 

produce hybrid fish such as tambatinga (female Colossoma macropomum × male P. 

brachypomus) and patinga (female Piaractus mesopotamicus × male P. brachypomus), 

which are equally important in fish farm production (MPA, 2013; IBGE, 2016).  

Despite the commercial importance of this species in the context of fishing and 

fish farming in South America and in other regions where it has been introduced, nothing 

is so far known about the myxozoan fauna parasites of P. brachypomus. The present 

study, which is part of ongoing research into South American myxozoans, describes two 

new myxosporean species found parasitizing pirapitinga specimens caught in a natural 

environment in the Amazon basin. The study was carried out using morphologic, 

histopathologic, ultrastructural and small subunit rDNA (ssrDNA) based phylogenetic 

analyses.  

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Twenty-five P. brachypomus specimens were caught between October 2014 and 

January 2016 in the Tapajós River (2°20’03.92”S 54°52’33.44”W), in the municipal 

district of Santarém, in the state of Pará, Brazil. Authorization for the fish capture and the 

genetic heritage access report were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of the 

Environment under processes SISBIO nº 44268-4 and SisGen nº A33CB83, respectively. 

The fish were transported live to a field laboratory and euthanized by spinal column 

transection. This methodology was approved by the ethics research committee of the 

Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering of the University of São Paulo (Process 

USP: 14.1.391.74.9) in accordance with Brazilian law (Federal Law nº 11794, dated 8 

October 2008 and Federal Decree No. 6899 dated July 15, 2009).

Morphological analysis 

Myxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and 

individually ruptured in glass slides. Mature myxospores were measured using a Leica 

DM 1000 Microscope coupled with Leica EC3 camera and LAS EZ image capture 

software. The dimensions of mature myxospores (N = 25) were obtained in according 

Lom and Arthur (1989) and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and range, in 

µm. The slides were then fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa to be deposited 

in the collection of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University 

of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. 

 

Histological analysis 

For histological analysis tissue fragments containing the plasmodia were fixed in 

buffered 10% formalin for 24h and placed in paraffin. Sections with a thickness of 4 µm 

were then stained with hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed and photographed in a Leica DM 

1000 Microscope coupled with a Leica EC3 camera and LAS EZ image capture software.  

 

Transmission electron microscopy 

For transmission electron microscopy, fragments of infected tissue were fixed, for 

at least 12h, in 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in the cacodylate buffer at 0.1 M sodium 

containing 3% of glucose at pH 7.4. The sample were then washed in the same buffer per 

2h and fixed in OsO4 for 4h. After dehydration in increasing concentrations of acetone 

the samples were embedded in Embed 812 resin. Uranyl acetate and lead citrate were 

used to treat ultrathin sections that, posteriorly, were examined in a LEO 906 transmission 

electron microscope operating at 60 kV.

 Molecular analysis 

DNA extraction, PCRs and Sequence assembly 

Host tissue was used for correct host identification by sequencing the ?-

tropomyosin gene. Ethanol-fixed myxospores were washed with Phosphate Buffered 

Saline (PBS) for DNA extraction and separate in microtubes containing the myxospores 

and host tissue were centrifuged at 13.000 rpm for three minutes, before the PBS buffer 

was removed.  

The DNA was extracted with DNeasy® Blood &amp;amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., 

California, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. For PCR reactions were used 

10 - 50 ng of genomic DNA, DreamTaq 12.5 µL of 2 × PCR Master Mix (Thermo 

Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 µM of each specific primer and nuclease free 

water (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) with final volume of 25 µL. In the 

ssrDNA amplification of the myxosporeans were used the primers ERIB1 (BARTA et al., 

1997), ACT1R (HALLET; DIAMANT, 2001), TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2015) 

and ERIB10 (BARTA et al., 1997). The TROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999) 

primers were used to amplifications of the ?-tropomyosin gene in accordance with 

Hashimoto et al. (2011), followed by modifications. The PCRs were carried out in a 

ProFlex PCR Systems thermocycler (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) with 

a program of 35 cycles for ?-tropomyosin gene at 95°C for 30 s, 64°C for 30 s and 72°C 

for 10 s.  For ssrDNA was used an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles: 

95°C for 60 s, 60°C for 60 s and 72°C for 90 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 minutes.  

All the PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in a TAE 

buffer (Tris–Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 Mm and EDTA 1 mM), stained 

with Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA), and 

analyzed in a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paraná, Brazil). The sizes of the amplified 



89 
 

 

fragments were estimated by comparison with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo 

Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA). The PCR products were purified using a 

QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) and sequenced with the 

same primer pairs used in the reaction, as well as the additional primers MC5f, MC3r 

(MOLNÁR et al., 2002) and BOBf (Present study, Chapter 1) for sequencing of ssrDNA. 

The sequencing of all samples was performed using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle 

Sequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) and an ABI 3730 DNA 

sequencing analyzer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA).  

The DNA sequences obtained were visualized and assembled using BioEdit 

7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) software. A BLASTn search (ALTSCHUL et al., 1997), available 

in the NCBI database, was performed to confirm the myxozoan and P. brachypomus host. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the sequences obtained plus ssrDNA 

sequences of the closest myxozoans to each one of the new species, based on the BLASTn 

searches carried out in the NCBI database. Four species of the genus Ceratomyxa 

Thélohan, 1892 were used as outgroup. All the sequences were aligned using the 

ClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON et al., 1994) by software BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, 

1999).  

The Maximum likelihood (ML) method was applied using the PhyML3.0 

(GUINDON et al., 2010) software, with a bootstrap value of 1000 replications. The 

FigTree v1.3.1 (RAMBAUT, 2008) and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc.) software 

programs were used to view and to edit, respectively, the tree generated. Only bootstrap 

values above 50 were displayed, and data related to the host fish, such as order and family, 

were obtained from FishBase (FROESE; PAULY, 2018).  



90 
 

 

To evaluate the genetic distance between the ssrDNA sequences of the new 

species with other myxosporean parasites of serrasalmids fish, a new alignment was 

performed using the species focus and the pairwise method was applied using the p-

distance model in the MEGA 7.0 software program (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, 

2016). 

 

RESULTS 

 

Occurrence 

Of 25 P. brachypomus specimens collected, 22 (88%) contained myxosporean 

plasmodia. Seventeen (68%), had plasmodia containing myxospores typical of the 

Henneguya genus in the gill filament, while four (16%) had plasmodia harboring 

myxospores with characteristics of the Myxobolus genus in the pyloric cecum. The 

morphological and ssrDNA sequence analyses revealed that both are new myxosporean 

species, and their descriptions are provided below.

Type host: Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. 

Locality of collection: Tapajós River, municipal district of Santarém, state of 

Pará, Brazil (2°23'07.5"S 54°47'05.9"W). 

Prevalence: 17 of 25 (68%). 

Site of infection: Gill lamellae. 



91 
 

 

Type of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the 

collections of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of 

Campinas (UNICAMP), São Paulo state, Brazil (ZUEC –MYX 86). 

Description and host-parasite relationship: plasmodia white and elongated 

measuring up to 0.3 mm in length were found in the gill filament of P. brachypomus. The 

mature myxospores had fusiform shape in the frontal view and measured 13.0 ± 0.5 (11.7 

to 13.8) µm in length, 4.3 ± 0.2 (4.0 to 4.6) µm in width, with caudal processes bigger 

than the myxospore body, measuring 44.7 ± 3.0 (40.5 to 48.1) µm and a total length of 

57.5 ± 3.5 (52.4 to 61.6) (Figure 8A). In lateral view the myxospores were 3.8 ± 0.2 (3.5 

to 4.3) µm in thickness. Polar capsules elongated, occupying more than half of the 

myxospore and measuring 6.3 ± 0.5 (5.6 to 7.3) µm in length and 1.6 ± 0.2 (1.3 to 2.0) 

µm in width, each containing a polar filament with 8-9 coils (Figures 8A, 10B and 11A) 

(Table 1).

Histological analysis showed that Henneguya n. sp. 1 developed in the gill 

lamellae (Figures 9A – B). The parasite development caused stretching of the epithelium 

and compression of the capillary and adjacent tissues. The hypertrophy of the infected 

lamellae produced displacement and deformation of the neighboring lamellae (Figure 9). 

No inflammatory infiltrate was observed.

Ultrastructural analysis of gill lamellae parasitized by Henneguya n. sp. 1 revealed 

thick peripheral ectoplasm, with extensive and numerous pinocytic channels connecting 

the external of the plasmodium to the interior and numerous mitochondria. Generative 

cells and young and mature myxospores were observed inside the plasmodium revealing 

an asynchronous sporogonic process, germinal nucleus, young spores and mature spores 

observed inside the plasmodium reveal an asynchronous sporogonic process (Figure 10). 

Young myxospores presented a polar capsule with a polar tubule, and a sporoplasm with 

sporoplasmosomes and some mitochondria (Figures 10B, 11A).

Genetics: The partial ssrDNA sequence with a fragment of 1971 bp, obtained 

from a single plasmodium of Henneguya n. sp. 1, was deposited in GenBank under 

accession number MK491272. BLASTn search revealed no match with any other 

myxosporeans ssr DNA available in genBank. Pairwise comparison considering parasites 

of serrasalmid hosts revealed Henneguya piaractus Martins and Souza, 1997 as the 

closest species to Henneguya n. sp. 1, with 5.1% of genetic divergence (Table 6). 

Remarks: the new Henneguya species was morphologically and genetically 

compared with all species reported infecting freshwater fishes (EIRAS et al., 2005, 2014; 

MADDEN, 2002). The morphologically closest species to Henneguya n. sp. 1 was H. 



96 
 

 

piaractus, which is a parasite of P. mesopotamicus, a congeneric fish to P. brachypomus, 

but endemic to the La Plata Basin. These two species are so similar that morphological 

distinction is an impossible task (Fig 8A and Table 5). In a typical sign of cryptical 

speciation ssrDNA sequencing revealed 5.1% of genetic divergence between the two. In 

terms of Henneguya spp. parasites of Amazonian fishes, the myxospores of Henneguya 

n. sp. 1 resembled those of Henneguya amazonica Rocha, Matos and Azevedo, 1992, a 

parasite of Crenlcichla lepldota Heckel, 1840. They were similar in myxospore length, 

polar capsule width, caudal process length, total myxospore length, and infection site. 

They differed in myxospore width (4.3 µm for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 5.7 µm for H. 

amazonica), polar capsule length (6.3 µm for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 3.3 µm for H. 

amazonica), number of polar tubule coils (8-9 for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 6 for H. 

amazonica), and host order/family (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae for Henneguya n. sp. 

1 and Perciformes: Cichlidae for H. amazonica). In the comparison with Henneguya spp. 

parasites of fish species from other regions, Henneguya n. sp. 1 exhibited 

morphometric/morphological differences at least one of the following properties: size 

and/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, number of polar tubule coils, site of 

infection and region of occurrence (EIRAS et al., 2005; 2014). It also differed in genetic 

identity comparison (Table 6 and BLASTn analysis). The creation of a new taxon is 

therefore proposed. 

 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 (Figures 8B, 12 – 14) 

Type host: Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818 Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. 

Type locality: Tapajós River, municipal district of Santarém, state of Pará, Brazil. 

Prevalence: 4 of 25 (16%). 

Site of infection: Pyloric cecum. 



97 
 

 

Type of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the 

collections of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of 

Campinas (UNICAMP), state of São Paulo, Brazil (ZUEC – MYX 85). 

Description and host-parasite relationship: plasmodia white and rounded 

measuring up to 0.2 mm in diameter were found in the pyloric cecum of P. brachypomus. 

Mature myxospores with an oval shape in the frontal view, measuring 10.4 ± 0.3 (10.0 to 

11.1) µm in length, 7.2 ± 0.1 (7.0 to 7.6) µm in width, and measuring 5.8 ± 0.2 (5.4 to 

6.3) µm in thickness in the lateral view (Figure 8B). The pyriform polar capsules occupied 

less than half of the myxospore, measuring 3.8 ± 0.1 (3.5 to 4.0) µm in length and 2.3 ± 

0.1 (2.0 to 2.6) µm in width (Figure 8B), each containing a polar filament with 6-7 coils 

(Figure 14A) (Table 5).  

The parasite developed in the pyloric cecum, and the plasmodia were surrounded 

by a thin layer of connective tissue, but no inflammatory infiltrate was observed (Figures 

12A – B).

Ultrastructure analysis displayed a thin ectoplasm zone, with few pinocytic 

channels, small vesicles and numerous mitochondria, which in the majority had a 

degraded internal membrane (Figures 13A – B). The sporogenesis process was

asynchronous and the polar capsules of the myxospores had a filament with 6-7 coils 

(Figures 13 and 14).

Genetics: A ssrDNA fragment with 1891 bp, obtained from a single plasmodium 

of Myxobolus n. sp. 3, was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK492647. 

In the BLASTn search, there was no match with the other available myxosporean 

ssrDNAs. Myxobolus colossomatis Molnár and Békési 1993 and Myxobolus cf. 

colossomatis were the closest species to M. pirapitingae n. sp., with a similarity of 89%. 

Remarks: The new Myxobolus species was morphologically and genetically 

compared with all the species reported infecting freshwater fish (EIRAS et al., 2005; 

2014; MADDEN, 2002). Of the parasites of serrasalmid fish, M. colossomatis, which also 

is a parasite of the Amazonian C. macropomum, was the morphologically closest species 

to M. pirapitingae n. sp. Similarities were observed in the length and width of the 

myxospores, the width of the polar capsules and the number of polar filament coils. But 



100 
 

 

significant differences were noted in the length of the polar capsules (3.8 µm for 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and 5.6 µm for M. colossomatis), and the existence of myxospores 

with elongated-ellipsoidal or oval shapes in M. colossomatis, compared with only oval 

shapes in the new species. In addition to the differences in size, the polar capsules of 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 were pear-shaped and occupied less than half the myxospore, while 

M. colossomatis exhibited elongated polar capsules which occupied half the myxospore. 

P-distance analysis revealed large genetic divergences of 10.7% between these species. 

In relation to other South American Myxobolus species, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 myxospores 

resembled those of Myxobolus cordeiroi Adriano, Arana, Alves, Silva, Ceccarelli, 

Henrique-Silva and Maia, 2009.  The resemblances were related to myxospore length, 

width, and thickness, while significant differences were observed in polar capsule length  

(3.8 µm for Myxobolus n. sp. 3  and 5.2 µm for M. cordeiroi) and width (2.6 µm for 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and 1.4 µm for M. cordeiroi), number of polar filament coils (6-7 for 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and 5-6 for M. cordeiroi), and order/family host (Characiformes: 

Serrasalmidae for Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and Siluriformes: Pimelodidae for M. cordeiroi). 

The genetic analysis corroborated the distinctions between these species, showing them 

in different evolutionary lineages in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 15). In comparison with 

parasites of fish species from other regions, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 exhibited 

morphometric/morphological differences in at least one of the following properties: the 

size and/or shape of the plasmodia and the myxospores, the number of polar tubule coils, 

the site of infection and the region of occurrence (EIRAS et al., 2005; 2014); it also 

differed in genetic identity comparison (Table 6 and BLASTn analysis). Based on these 

data, the creation of a new taxon is proposed.

Phylogenetic analysis 

Phylogenetic analysis using the ssrDNA sequences of the closest myxosporeans to each 

of the new species based on BLAST searches placed the grouping in two main lineages: the 

smaller clustered only Myxobolus species, while the larger grouped the Myxobolus/Henneguya 

species. Myxobolus n. sp. 3 appears in the sister branch of Myxobolus n. sp. 1 (Present study, 

Chapter 1) and M. colossomatis. Henneguya n. sp. 1 appears as a sister species of H. piaractus, 

in a sister branch of the larger lineage composed of Myxobolus/Henneguya species (Figure 15).

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and other myxobolids based on ssrDNA. The numbers above the nodes 

indicate bootstrap confidence levels. Dashes are shown for values under 50%. 

 

 

Genetic host identification 

 The host species were confirmed as pure though the sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin 

gene of approximately 300 bp, demonstrating 100% of similarity with P. brachypomus 

species using BLASTn of the GenBank database.

DISCUSSION 

Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3 are the first myxozoans described infecting 

pirapitinga, an iconic species of fishing and fish farming in the Amazon. Histological analysis 

of both species revealed the absence of inflammatory infiltrate, which is a common feature in 

myxosporean infections (SITJA-BOBADILLA, 2008). However, in Henneguya n. sp. 1 the 

growth of the plasmodia induced stretching of the epithelium and compression of the capillaries 

of the lamellae. In addition, there was displacement and deformation of the neighboring 

lamellae, demonstrating the pathogenic potential of this species in high intensities in farmed 

fish. Similar tissue damage has been observed in infections by H. piaractus, commonly found 

parasitizing the gill lamellae of the congeneric fish P. mesopotamicus in Brazilian fish farms 

(MARTINS et al., 1997; ADRIANO et al., 2005; MULLER et al., 2013). Under the conditions 

of the present study, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 did not demonstrate pathogenic potential, largely due 

to the site of infection and the changes observed therein. 

Ultrastructural analysis of the host-parasite interaction revealed pinocytic channels in 

both the species here described, a common strategy by which myxosporeans obtain nutrients to 

support sporogonic development inside the plasmodia (HALLETT; DIAMANT, 2001; EL-

MANSY; BASHTAR, 2002; AZEVEDO; MATOS, 2003; OVCHARENKO et al., 2017). 

Generative cells and young developmental spore stages occurred in the periphery of the 

plasmodium, while advanced sporogonic stages and mature myxospores were found in the 

central section, following a common sporogenesis pattern of Myxobolus/Henneguya plasmodia 

(ADRIANO et al., 2005; NALDONI et al., 2018). 

Phylogenetic analysis based on ssrDNA sequences revealed Henneguya n. sp. 1 

clustering in a basal branch as a sister species to H. piaractus, which parasites the gill lamellae 

of the congeneric host P. mesopotamicus, but which is endemic to the La Plata basin 

(MARTINS; SOUZA; 1997; ADRIANO et al., 2005). Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustered in a sub-



105 
 

 

clade composed of Myxobolus species which also parasite other South American serrasalmid 

fish. These results showed Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustering in distinct 

lineages in the tree, corroborating the absence of monophyly in the lineage of 

Myxobolus/Henneguya parasites of South American serrasalmids, as stated in the present study 

(Chapter 1). 

The present study expands our knowledge of the diversity of myxosporean parasites of 

Amazonian Serrasalmidae fish, describing two new species, and offering new insights into the 

evolution and host-parasite relationship of myxosporean infections in these important native 

fish for fishing and fish farming.

CHAPTER 3. MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY OF TWO MYXOSPOREAN 

SPECIES PARASITIZING Piaractus brachypomus FROM THE AMAZON BASIN 

 

ABSTRACT 

Mixosporids, belonging to the Cnidaria phylum, are obligate endoparasites, which mainly infect 

fish and which comprise more than 2,400 described species. They have a complex life cycle, 

involving an invertebrate and vertebrate host. Among the species of fish that harbor these 

parasites, the species Piaractus brachypomus, popularly known as pirapitinga, has great 

economic importance, especially in the region of the Amazon basin, where it is widely found. 

The objective of this study was to characterize, through morphological, molecular and 

phylogentic analyses, the new species of myxosporids found infecting P. brachypomus. In this 

study, 25 specimens of P. brachypomus were collected, of which 16 (64%) were infected in the 

gill filament with a Henneguya species and 3 (12%) with a Myxobolus species in intestine. The 

morphological and morphometric analysis of Henneguya n. sp. 2 revealed myxospores with 

ellipsoid shaped and prolongation of the valves were lager than the length of the body. The 

polar capsules were elongated and occupied less than half of the body. Molecular analysis 

generated a partial sequence of 1946 pb of the ssrDNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a cluster 

according to the order/family of the host, with Henneguya piaractus being the closest related 

species. Myxobolus n. sp. 4 in morphological analysis revealed myxospores with an oval shaped 

body and polar capsules of the same size occupying less than half of the body. Molecular 

analysis generated a 1950 bp partial sequence of the ssrDNA and phylogenetic analysis revealed 

a cluster as a sister species of Myxobolus colossomatis. Sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin gene 

confirmed that the collected fish belonged to the species P. brachypomus. The results obtained 

for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and Myxobolus n. sp. 4 confirmed that both isolates are from species not 

yet described in the literature.

INTRODUCTION 

Myxozoa subphylum is composed of microscopic cnidarians that have adaptations to 

parasitism (OKAMURA et al., 2015). There are some 2400 described species which the great 

majority are myxosporeans (FIALA et al., 2015). These parasites infect mainly fish, in the 

natural environment and fish farms, but also birds, amphibians, and reptiles (Bartholomew et 

al., 2008). With the development of aquaculture, the interest in the group has intensified, since 

many species cause serious disease outbreaks that can generate significant economic impacts, 

especially where prevalence rates are high. (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006).  

The myxosporeans are highly specialized metazoan parasites characterized by 

multicellular spores, with polar capsules containing an extrusible polar filament (FEIST; 

LONGSHAW, 2006). These organisms can be found infecting several organs and have high 

specificity both for the host and for the tissues they infect (BÉKÉSI et al., 2002). In addition, 

parasites develop in plasmodia that may or may not cause tissue compression and an 

inflammatory host response (EIRAS, 1994; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). Most species are not 

pathogenic, but several of them cause significant damage to their hosts (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 

2006). 

Among the Myxosporea class, the genera Henneguya Thélohan, 1892 and Myxobolus 

Bütschli, 1882 are the most specious, with approximately 192 species described of Henneguya 

and 850 of Myxobolus (EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012; EIRAS et al. 2014).  

The present study is part of a research that involves morphological and molecular 

analyses for the identification of new species of myxosporeans found infecting the species 

Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818.  Using light microscopy and amplification of the 

ssrDNA, we described new species of Henneguya and Myxobolus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Sample collection 

Twenty-five specimens of P. brachypomus were caught (SISBIO nº 44268-4 and SisGen 

nº A33CB83) between October 2014 and January 2016 from Tapajós River, municipality of 

Santarém, Pará State, Brazil. In total, twenty specimens (80%) were infected with myxozoan 

plasmodia. All the fish handling was approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of 

the Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo – USP 

Process USP: 14.1.391.74-9 (ATTACHMENT B).  

Immediately after capture, the fish were transported alive to the field laboratory where 

they were euthanized by transection of the spinal cord. After euthanasia, then were weighed, 

measured and an external analysis was performed in search of parasite plasmodia. 

Subsequently, the necropsy was performed to expose of the gills and the visceral cavity, in 

order to detect possible alterations in the characteristics of the organs and the presence of 

parasites. Fragments of host tissue infected with Myxozoa plasmodia were also collected for 

molecular confirmation of the host. All material was fixed in absolute ethanol for molecular 

analyses and in formaldehyde for morphological characterization of the myxospores. 

 

Morphological analysis 

For morphological analysis, plasmodia fixed in formaldehyde were separated from the 

host tissue, placed on a slide and ruptured. The measures of the myxospores was performed in 

accordance with Lom and Arthur (1989), using a computer equipped with Axivision 4.1 

software, linked to Axioplan 2 Zeiss microscope. Thirty-six mature myxospores of Henneguya 

n. sp. 2 and thirty-one of Myxobolus n. sp. 4 were photographed. The dimensions were 

expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The slides were then fixed with methanol and 



114 
 

 

stained with Giemsa to be deposited in the collection of the Adão José Cardoso Museum of 

Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. 

 

Molecular analysis and sequencing 

In molecular analysis, after capturing images, the slides containing myxospores were 

washed with PBS buffer and collected in a microtube. After centrifugation, one more washing 

was done with PBS buffer to remove remnants of the ethanol. DNA was extracted using the 

DNeasy® Blood &amp;amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's 

instructions. DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer 

(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) at 260 nm.  The ssrDNA was amplified by PCR and the 

reactions were performed with a final volume of 25 µL containing 10-50 ng of genomic DNA, 

12.5 µL of 2 × DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA), 

0.2 ?M of each primer and nuclease-free water (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, 

USA). The PCR amplifications were performed in a ProFlex PCR Systems (Applied 

BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) thermocycler with a program consisting of initial 

denaturation carried out at 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C 

for 60 s), hybridization (60 °C for 60 s) and extension (72 °C for 90 s) and a final extended 

elongation step at 72 °C for 5 minutes. 

Partial sequence of the ssrDNA was amplified using two primers pairs: ERIB1 (BARTA 

et al., 1997) with ACT1R (HALLET; DIAMANT, 2001) and TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 

2015) with ERIB10 (BARTA et al., 1997). PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel 

electrophoresis in a TAE buffer (Tris–Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 mM, EDTA 

1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) 

and analyzed with a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paraná, Brazil). The sizes of the amplified 

fragments were estimated by comparison using the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific 



115 
 

 

– Carlsbad, California, USA). Amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification 

Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) according to the manufacturer's specifications, quantified in 

2% agarose gel electrophoresis and compared to Low DNA Mass (Thermo Scientific – 

Carlsbad, California, USA).  

Sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with specific primers on the 

ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA), using the BigDye® 

Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA).  

Afterwards, the obtained sequences were visualized, edited and aligned in the program BioEdit 

7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) using the ClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON, 1994), and a consensus 

sequence was obtained for each sample. The consensus sequences were submitted to BLASTn 

analysis for the search for similarity in the GenBank database (NCBI). The p-distance analysis 

was performed in the MEGA 7.0 (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, 2016) to verify the genetic 

distance between the species of this study and other myxozoan sequences available in the NCBI.  

For the molecular characterization of P. brachypomus species, the DNA extraction from 

the fish tissue was carried out in the same way as for myxosporeans. The amplification and 

sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin gene from the two specimens of fish infected by Henneguya  

and Myxobolus were performed according to Hashimoto et al. (2011) using the primer pair 

TROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999). The amplification product was obtained and then 

sent for sequencing. The sequences obtained were subjected to BLASTn analysis of the 

GenBank database to search for genetic similarity and confirmation of the host species. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

For phylogenetic analysis the partial ssrDNA sequences of Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 

Myxobolus n. sp. 4 and closest DNA sequences from the NCBI database of genera Heneguya 

and Myxobolus were used to phylogenetic analysis. The analysis was performed using 



116 
 

 

maximum likelihood in PhyML software (GUINDON et al., 2010) and a bootstrap analysis of 

1000 replicates. Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 and Ceratomyxa 

amazonensis Mathews, Naldoni, Maia and Adriano, 2016 were used as the outgroup. 

 

RESULTS 

 

Identification of the host collected  

The amplification of the ?-tropomyosin gene, resulted in a fragment of approximately 

300 pb. The sequences obtained were aligned with two other P. brachypomus sequences 

deposited on GenBank (accession numbers: HQ420087 and AY817271), demonstrating 100% 

similarity. 

 

Taxonomic data 

Two new species found infecting P. brachypomus from Tapajós River were 

characterized through of the morphological, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. 

 

Henneguya n. sp. 2 (Figures 16A, 17A) 

Description: Plasmodia were rounded and yellow. Mature myxospores of Henneguya 

n. sp. had ellipsoid shape in frontal view, measuring 13.6 ± 0.5 ?m length and 3.6 ± 0.2 ?m 

width. In lateral view, the body spores were fusiform and symmetrical with 2.5 ± 0.4 ?m 

thickness. Prolongation of the valves were lager than the length of the body, measuring 40.3 ± 

2.7 ?m, with a total spore length of 53.4 ± 2.9 ?m. The polar capsules were elongated and 

occupied less than half of the body, measuring 5.0 ± 0.5 ?m in length and 1.4 ± 0.2 ?m in width 

(Table 7). It was not possible to count the number of coils of the polar filament by light 

microscopic (Figure 16A).

Type locality: Tapajós River, municipal district of Santarém, state of Pará, Brazil 

(2°23'07.5"S 54°47'05.9"W). 

Occurrence:  16 of 25 (64%). 

Site of infection: Gill filament. 



118 
 

 

Type of material: Slides stained with myxospores was deposited in the collections of 

the Adão José Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), 

São Paulo state, Brazil (accession number ZUEC –MYX88). 

Molecular data: Sequencing of the ssrDNA resulted in a partial sequence of 1946 pb. 

Remarks: According to the BLASTn analysis, based on the ssrDNA sequence, the 

closest species of Henneguya n. sp. 2 was Henneguya pellucida Adriano, Arana and Cordeiro, 

2006, showing 89% similarity, which was described as infecting Piaractus mesopotamicus 

from fish farming in the state of São Paulo. The comparison between these two species, through 

morphological and morphometric analysis, showed some differences.  With respect to the 

morphology, Henneguya n. sp. 2 showed elongated body when compared to H. pellucida and 

the caudal extension of Henneguya n. sp. 2 was longer. The morphometric comparison revealed 

differences with respect to: body lengh (13.6 µm for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 11.4 µm for H. 

pellucida), polar capsule length (5.0 µm for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 4.0 µm for H. pellucida), 

total length (53.4 ?m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 33.3 ?m for H. pellucida) and length of the 

caudal extension (40.3 ?m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 24.1 ?m for H. pellucida). In addition to 

the morphological and morphometric differences, there are differences in relation to the host 

(P. brachypomus for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and P. mesopotamicus for H. pellucida) and the 

locality (the Amazon basin for Henneguya n.  sp. 2 and fish farms in the state of São Paulo for 

H. pellucida) (Table 7). The p-distance analysis, based in parasites species of serrasalmids fish, 

showed Henneguya n. sp. 2 as closest species of Henneguya sp. 1 (Present study, Chapter 2) 

with 16.3% of genetic difference (Table 8). 

 

Myxobolus n. sp. 4 (Figures 16B, 17B) 

Description: Plasmodia were rounded and yellow. Mature myxospores of Myxobolus 

n. sp. 4 had an oval body shape, measuring 12.9 ± 0.5 ?m in length, 7.5 ± 0.3 ?m in width and 



119 
 

 

5.4 ± 0.2 ?m in thickness. The polar capsules were of equal size, presenting 5.4 ± 0.3 ?m in 

length and 2.2 ± 0.1 ?m in width (Table 7). It was not possible to count the number of coils of 

the polar filament (Figure 16B).  

Type locality: Tapajós River, municipal district of Santarém, state of Pará, Brazil 

(2°23'07.5"S 54°47'05.9"W). 

Occurrence: 3 of 25 (12%). 

Site of infection: Intestine. 

Type of material: Slides stained with myxospores was deposited in the Adão José 

Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), São Paulo 

state, Brazil (accession number ZUEC – MYX87). 

Molecular data: Sequencing of the ssrDNA resulted in a partial sequence of 1950 pb. 

Remarks: The partial sequence of ssrDNA of Myxobolus n. sp. 4 showed, according to 

BLASTn analysis, to be a distinct species from others species with sequences deposited in 

GenBank. The closest species was Myxobolus colossomatis Molnár and Békési (1993) with 

94% similarity, described infecting several organs of Colossoma macropomum collected in the 

Amazon basin. Considering parasite species of serrasalmids, Myxobolus n. sp. 4 was the closest 

species to M. colossomatis. The comparison between these two species, through morphological 

and morphometric analysis, showed differences. With respect to morphology, Myxobolus n. sp. 

4 had an ellipsoidal shape and the polar capsules occupied half of the myxospore body, whereas 

M. colossomatis had an oval shape, an anterior end, and polar capsules occupying half of the 

myxospore body. The morphometric comparison revealed similarities with respect to body 

length and polar capsules width. The differences were with respect to: body width (7.5 ?m for 

Myxobolus n. sp. 4 and 6.9 ?m for M. colossomatis), polar capsule length (5.4 ?m for Myxobolus 

n. sp. 4 and 6.0 ?m for M. colossomatis). In addition, there are differences in relation to the host 

(P. brachypomus for Myxobolus n. sp. 4 and C. macropomum for M. colossomatis) (Table 7). 



120 
 

 

In additional, the p-distance analysis, based in parasites species of serrasalmids fish, showed 

Myxobolus n. sp. 4 as closest species of M. colossomatis (Present study, Chapter 1) with 6.3% 

of genetic difference (Table 8).

Phylogenetic analysis 

Henneguya n. sp. 2 and Myxobolus n. sp. 4 aggrouped in according with the family 

and order of the host as observed by Fiala et al. (2006). Henneguya n. sp. 2 aggrouped alone 

in a clade. Myxobolus n. sp. 4 aggrouped as a sister specie of M. colossomatis described 

infecting gills of C. macropomum in a subclade composed only Myxobolus species that 

infecting Characiformes fish (Figure 18).

DISCUSSION   

Henneguya sp. 2 and Myxobolus sp. 4 were compared, 

morphological/morphometrically, with others myxosporean species around of the world and 

with all species of Henneguya and Myxobolus described in the South America freshwater fish 

(EIRAS et al., 2014), indicating that the species described here differs of others species 

(EIRAS, MOLNÁR; LU, 2005), besides the host and locality of collection. 



124 
 

 

For myxosporean species that infecting fish of the Serrasalmidae family 14 

myxobolids were described. Henneguya pilosa Azevedo; Matos, 2003, Henneguya pellucida 

Adriano, Arana and Cordeiro, 2005, Henneguya curvata Barassa et al. (2003), Henneguya 

piaractus Martins and Souza, 1997, Henneguya sp. 1; Myxobolus colossomatis Molnár and 

Békési, 1993, Myxobolus cuneus Adriano et al., 2006, Myxobolus maculatus Casal et al., 

2002, Myxobolus metynnis Casal et al., 2006, Myxobolus myleus Azevedo et al., 2012, 

Myxobolus cf. colossomatis Muller et al., 2013, Myxobolus sp. 1 (Present study) and 

Myxobolus sp. 2 (Present study). In P. brachypomus two myxosporean species have been 

related previously, with Henneguya n. sp. 1 (Present study) parasitizing the gill filament and 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3 (Present study) parasitizing the intestine.  

Based on ssrDNA sequences of myxosporean parasites of serrasalmids fish, 

Henneguya n. sp. 2 was the closest to Henneguya n. sp. 1, both parasites of P. brachypomus 

from the Amazon basin, with 16.3% of difference, demonstrating that this host specie harbors 

two distinct Henneguya species which infect the gill filament. For Myxobolus n. sp. 4, M. 

colossomatis was closest species with 6.3% of difference, but this species showed differences 

morphologic and host, being sufficient to consider these two distinct species. 

 Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the tendency of the myxosporeans to group 

according to the host order as previous studies (FIALA, 2006; FERGUSON et al., 2008; 

CARRIERO et al., 2013; MOREIRA et al., 2014), as well as the influence of the infected 

tissue in which clustering occurred primarily by host affinity and after by tissue or organ 

tropism, positioning Henneguya n. sp. 2, as well Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Henneguya piaractus, 

as basal species of the major clade separated from the others myxosporids. Myxobolus n. sp. 

4 aggrouped as a sister specie of M. colossomatis in a well-supported subclade composed only 

with Myxobolus species parasites of Characiformes fish from the Amazon basin and which 



125 
 

 

was closely related to Myxobolus species that infecting South American characiforms as 

observed by Zatti et al. (2018). 

 We provide here morphological and molecular data of two news species of 

myxosporeans that infecting P. brachypomus from the Tapajós River, contribuiting for the 

knowledgement of the biodiversity of myxosporean species.

CHAPTER 4.  REMARKS ON MITOCHONDRIAL BEHAVIOR IN 

MYXOSPOREANS 

 

ABSTRACT 

Myxozoa are parasites that mainly infect fish, but also reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals 

and has a complex life cycle. The initial aim of this study was to amplify the mitochondrial 

gene Citochrome C Oxidase I of myxosporean parasites of Colossoma macropomum and 

Piaractus brachypomus from Amazon basin. Primers and protocols described in the literature 

as well as others primers were used for amplification, however, no amplification was obtained. 

Thus, the present study consists in to report remarks about mitochondrial behavior in 

myxosporeans of Henneguya sp. found infecting Astyanax altiparanae from CEPTA fish farm, 

of Pirassununga municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 17 specimens of A. altiparanae 

were collected and 9 presented Henneguya sp. plasmodia in the fins. Plasmodia was ruptured 

and myxospores were stained with MitoTracker® Orange and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 

(DAPI). The results showed that only some Henneguya sp. myxospores presented labeling for 

mitochondrial activity and all myxospores presented labeling for nucleuos.  

 

Key-words: Henneguya sp., Myxozoa, mitochondrial fluorescence microscopy and COI. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

As important model organisms, cnidarians are fundamentals for research, where the 

Hydra genus is the model organism used for understanding processes of morphogenesis and 

regeneration (CHAPMAN et al., 2010) and, also, as model of non-senescence (BOEHM et al. 

2013). 



131 
 

 

Belonging to Cnidaria phylum, myxozoans are parasites that infect a wide range of 

invertebrate and vertebrate hosts in worldwide (LOM; DYKOVÁ, 2006). With more than 2400 

nominal species (ZHANG, 2011), they are distributed in 63 genera, and classified mainly by 

myxospore morphology (FIALA et al., 2015). The genus Henneguya Thélohan, 1892, 

encompasses approximately 200 species and are most commonly found in fresh water fishes 

(EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012). Although most species do not cause disease, some are highly 

pathogenic causing severe disease in economically important fish and give rise to serious 

ecological on their host populations (KENT et al. 2001; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006; FEIST, 

2008; OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). 

With a complex life cycle, myxosporeans have been identified in fish, repteils, 

amphibians and birds (BARTHOLOMEW et al., 2008), around the world, but little is known 

about their diversity, pathological impact on host, as well the biology these parasites 

(KODÁDKOVÁ, 2014). Regarding the biology of myxosporeans, myxospores are formed 

within plasmodia/pseudoplasmodia and they are characterized by multicellular myxospores, 

comprised of external valve cells that enclose polar capsules containing extrudable polar 

filaments and one or two sporoplasm cells (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006; OKAMURA, 

GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). 

Takeuchi et al. (2015) sequenced for the first time the mitochondrial genome of Kudoa 

species and suggested that the genome of Myxozoa is in general extremely divergent from 

others metazoans. 

The initial objective of this study was to amplify the mitochondrial gene of 

myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish as Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus 

brachypomus. In additional, was performed fluorescence microscopy to observe the 

mitochondrial activity of Henneguya sp. found infecting Astyanax altiparanae.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 

COI amplification in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish 

Samples collection 

A total of 61 fish (25 of P. brachypomus and 36 of C. macropomum) were caught 

(SISBIO nº 44268-4 and SisGen nº A33CB83) in October 2014, March 2015 and January 2016 

in the Amazon basin, in Santarém, Pará State and in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. The fish 

were transported live to a field laboratory and euthanized by transection spinal column. The 

methodology of the present study was approved by the ethics research committee of the Faculty 

of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of São Paulo – Process USP: 

14.1.391.74.9 (ATTACHMENT B) in accordance with Brazilian law (Federal Law nº 11794, 

dated 8 October 2008 and Federal Decree No. 6899 dated July 15, 2009). 

DNA extraction 

DNA from the isolated myxosporeans samples was extracted with the DNeasy® Blood 

&amp;amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions and 

was quantified in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) 

at 260 nm. 

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 

PCR for amplification mitochondrial gene were performed with final volume of 25 µl, 

containing 10-50 ng genomic DNA, 12.5 µl of 2 × DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo 

Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 µM of each primer and free water of nucleases 

(Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA). For gene amplification, were used two pairs 

of primers (Table 9).  

For PCR amplifications were used a ProFlex PCR Systems (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., 

California, USA) thermocycler. Initially, the reactions were performed in according to Folmer 



133 
 

 

et al. (1994) (Table 10). After this, primers were designed and others techniques for 

amplification of gene were tested (Tables 9,10).

Transmission electron microscopy in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish 

For transmission electron microscopy, plasmodia were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde 

diluted in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 12h, washed in glucose-saline solution for 2h 

and fixed in OsO4. After, these samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone 

and embedded in Embed 812 resin. Uranyl acetate citrate was used to treat ultrathin sections 

that, posteriorly, were examined in a LEO 906 transmission electron microscope operating at 

60 kV. 

 

Fluorescence microscopy in myxosporeans found in Astyanax altiparanae 

Sample collection 

Seventeen specimens of A. altiparanae were collected in May 2018 from Center 

National Research and Conservation Continental Aquatic Biodiversity (CEPTA) - ICMBio, 

municipality of Pirassununga, São Paulo State, Brazil. The fish were caught using nets and 

taken alive to laboratory. Before the examination, the fish were euthanized by lidocaine 

overdose. All the fish handling was approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of the 

Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of São Paulo Process USP: 

14.1.391.74-9 (ATTACHMENT B).  

After euthanasia, an external analysis was performed in search of parasite plasmodia. 

Subsequently, the necropsy was performed with exposure of the gills and the visceral cavity, in 

order to detect possible alterations in the characteristics of the organs and the presence of 

plasmodia. Myxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and kept in 

microtubes containing PBS. 

Staining with MitoTracker® Orange 

Plasmodium containing live myxospores was ruptured and myxospores released were 

washed with PBS and centrifuged. After this, the myxospores were stained with MitoTracker® 



135 
 

 

Orange (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) for 30 minutes at concentration of 250 

nM at room temperature. After stain, myxospores were washed three times with PBS and 

visualized in inverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic camera Axio 

Can 503. 

Permeabilization and Staining with DAPI and MitoTracker® Orange 

Plasmodium containing live myxospores was ruptured and myxospores released were 

washed with PBS and centrifuged. After this, the myxospores were permeabilized with PBS 

containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Myxospores permeabilized were washed three times with 

PBS, centrifuged, and stained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride - DAPI 

(Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) 0.004 mg mL-1 for 10 minutes. The samples 

were rinsed with PBS and centrifuged to remove supernadant. Myxospores were then stained 

with MitoTracker Orange® (Thermo Scientific – Carlsbad, California, USA) for 30 minutes at 

concentration of 250 nM at room temperature. After stain, myxospores were washed three times 

with PBS and visualized in inverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic 

camera Axio Can 503. 

 

RESULTS 

 

COI amplification in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish 

Despite our efforts to obtain a COI gene sequence of myxosporids, no amplification was 

obtained. 16S F and 16S R are universal primers and were used for PCR walking method. 

However, the fragment of approximately 550 bp obtained was submitted BLASTn analysis 

(ALTSCHUL et al., 1997) which showed 100% of similarity with C. macropomum fish.

Transmission electron microscopy in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish 

Ultrastructural analysis of Myxobolus n. sp. 3 found infecting pyloric cecum of P. 

brachypomus showed several mitochondria in the periphery of the plasmodium and a reduced 

number of mitochondria in the central part of plasmodium (Figure 19A). In ectoplasm was 

observed a misshapen mitochondrion with the crests clearly evident and spherical mitochondria 

inside of secondary cells, with the mitochondrial crests less evident (Figure 19B). Henneguya 

n. sp. 1 found infecting gill filament of P. brachypomus showed large mitochondria near of 

ectoplasm and smaller mitochondria within of the myxospore at an advanced stage of 

development (Figures 20A – B).

Fluorescence microscopy in myxosporeans found in Astyanax altiparanae 

Sample collection 

A total of 17 specimens of A. altiparanae were collected in CEPTA fish farm, 9 (53%) 

had plasmodia harboring Henneguya sp. infecting the fins. 

Staining with MitoTracker® Orange 

Henneguya sp. was stained with MitoTracker Orange, which is an orange-fluorescent 

dye able to stain mitochondria in live cells and its accumulation is dependent upon membrane 

potential. For this reason, staining was performed with fresh myxospores. 



139 
 

 

The results showed that only a few myxospores presented labeling for mitochondrial 

activity (Figure 21).

Permeabilization and Staining with DAPI and MitoTracker® Orange 

The results showed that all myxospores presented labeling for nucleus, but only some 

myxospores presented reading for mitochondrial activity (Figure 22).

DISCUSSION 

For COI mitochondrial amplification were initially used protocols and universal primers 

described by Folmer et al. (1994), unsuccessfully. Then, primers (Table 9) were designed based 

on COI gene sequences of species phylogenetically closer to the myxosporids deposited in 

GenBank. PCR conditions such as primer hybridization temperature (Table 10), extension time, 

DNA concentration and MgCl2 were evaluated for standardization for each primer studied. 

However, no amplification was obtained. 

Takeuchi et al. (2015) sequenced the mitochondrial genome of three species of the genus 

Kudoa and observed that the genomes are not conserved among these species, suggesting that 

the mitochondrial genes of myxosporids are, in general, potentially divergent. This may be one 

of the reasons why we can not achieve the amplification of the mitochondrial COI gene, since 

there may not be a conserved region for the design of specific primers for amplification 

mitochondrial gene of myxosporeans. 

In view of the difficulty found in the amplification of the COI, we begin to investigate 

the mitochondria of the parasite analyzing the ultrastructural images of Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 

Myxobolus n. sp. 3, (Figures 19, 20), as well as other images of myxosporeans already published 

in the literature. And we observed, as well as Alama-Bermejo et al. (2012), that mitochondria 

are smaller in the sporogony phase than in the pre-sporogony phase. In addition to a reduced 

number of these organelles in the central part of the plasmodium where mature myxospores 

become agglomerated. 

Wood et al. (2002) attempted to amplify mitochondrial genes of myxosporids without 

success and thus stated that these parasites are amitocondrials. This statement is contradictory 

when compared to ultrastructural studies, where it is possible to identify many mitochondria in 

the periphery of the plasmodium (OKAMURA et al., 2015).  



142 
 

 

Based on these studies, we assume that the mitochondrial activity could be related to the 

development phase of the parasite, being less active in mature myxospores. 

For first experiment was only used MitoTracker® dye as an initial study and the 

myxospores no marked suggested a possible waterproofing of the chitin wall of the mature 

myxospore leaflets and as a consequence the non-penetration of the reagent. 

For this reason, for the second experiment was performed the permeabilization of the 

myxospore as also the labeling for nucleus with DAPI dye as described by Adriano and 

Okamura (2017) for the nucleus is a structure present in mature or immature myxospores. After 

this, the same samples were stained with MitoTracker® Orange to the labeling for mitochondrial 

activity. The results showed that all myxospores observed were able to emit fluorescence for 

labeling of nucleus, but only some showed labeling for mitochondrial activity.  

Accordding to Jirk? et al. (2007) in mature phase, the myxospore leaflets harden causing 

a dormancy stage. Thus, the energy expenditure of mature myxospores can be reduced during 

this period. 

In myxosporeans is evident that the mitochondrial cristae can assume different shapes 

(GRIPARIC; VANDER BLIEK, 2001) and sometimes this can reflect in differences in 

biochemistry within the same tissues (RIVA et al., 2005). 

In a study of the ultrastructural features of Ceratomyxa sp. Diamant and Paperna (1989) 

reported mitochondria elongated and tubular in the plasmodium ectoplasm, while those inside 

the sporoblast and developing myxospores were typically spherical and contained considerably 

more matrix. Elmansy and Bashtar (2002) observed that numerous mitochondria, containing 

more cristae were usually located close to the nucleus of the sporoplasm in myxospore 

maturation of Henneguya suprabranchiae Landsberg (1987). Furthermore, glycogen-like 

material were more common in the sporoplasm of the mature myxospores of H. 

suprabranchiae, can represent an energy supply necessary for subsequent developmental stage 



143 
 

 

of life cycle and may be similar to sporoplasmosomes of other myxosporeans (EL-MATBOULI 

et al. 1990). 

Sporoplasmosomes are intracellular structures present in the sporoplasm of the parasite 

and its function is still unknown (LOM et al., 1989), suggesting for us a possible energy storage 

through these structures so that the parasite becomes viable during the period of dormancy that, 

according to Yokoyama et al. (1993), can last for months or years until the myxospore is 

ingested by the invertebrate host.  

Thus, according to Feist et al. (2015), cellular processes involved in development have 

been highly modified in myxosporeans and many these modifications require further research 

and clarification. 

 

KEY QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY 

- Why only some myxospores presented mitochondrial activity? 

- Does mature myxospores really have inactive mitochondria? 

- Is there any structure inside mature myxospores able of storing energy?
