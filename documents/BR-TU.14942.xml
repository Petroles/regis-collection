Abstract 
 
 The 57 sites (24 geosites, 25 gold historical sites and 8 other sites) from the 

Golden Geopark of Lapland project were assessed in terms of touristic value as well as 

their degradation risk using two methodologies: points and percentage. For the 

assessment of the touristic value four main criteria were used: a) Availability; b) Use; c) 

Logistics; d) Perceptiveness. These criteria include eighteen sub-criteria: 1. Seasonal 

occupancy; 2. Terrestrial availability; 3. Availability according with people´s physical 

conditions when the activity is walking or hiking; 4. Boat and/or canoe access; 5. 

Visibility; 6. Safety in case of an accident; 7. Safety in the site and its access; 8. 

Signage; 9. The current use of the site in terms of geological/historical interest; 10. The 

current use of the site for other interests; 11. Use limitations of the site; 12. Cleanliness; 

13. Toilets; 14. Restaurants; 15. Accommodation; 16. Local buses; 17. Aesthetics and 

18. Interpretative potential. The results obtained following the percentage and points 

methodologies were grouped in five categories for a better guidance: Insufficient 

(values between 0% - 49% and 0 – 4.8 points); Sufficient (values between 49.5% - 69% 

and 4.9 – 5.9 points ); Good (values between 69.5% - 79% and 6 -7.9 points); Very 

Good (values between 79.5% - 89% and 8 – 8.9 points) and finally Excellent (values 

between 89.5% - 100% and 9 – 10 points). It was possible to find that the average 

touristic value of geosites and gold historical sites is not high using both methodologies, 

being included in the category “Sufficient” (58.34% and 5.86 for the geosites and 

59.64% and 5.79 points for the gold historical sites).  Best results in touristic value were 

obtained by the other sites, with their average value being included in the “Goo?” 

category (70.33% and 7.07 points). Analyzing all the 57 sites, the average score of the 

touristic potential was 62.77% and 6.24 points, corresponding to t?? “Suff?c??nt” 

category in percentage methodology but in t?? ?n “Goo?” cat??ory ?n the points 

methodology.  Based on the data obtained regarding tourism value and degradation risk, 

some actions were proposed to improve the sites.

Avaliação do valor turístico dos sítios do projecto de Geoparque de Ouro da 

Lapónia (Finlândia): avaliação e promoção. 

Resumo 
 

 Os 57 sítios (24 geosítios, 25 sítios históricos do ouro e 8 outros sítios) do 

projecto Geoparque de Ouro da Lapónia (“Golden Geopark of Lapland”) foram 

avaliados em termos do seu valor turístico e do seu risco de degradação. Foram usadas 

duas metodologias: pontos e percentagem. Para a avaliação do valor turístico foram 

usados quatro critérios principais: a) Disponibilidade; b) Uso; c) Logística; d) Sentidos. 

Esses critérios incluem dezoito subcritérios: 1. Ocupação sazonal; 2. Acessibilidade 

terrestre; 3. Acessibilidade de acordo com as condições físicas da pessoa quando a 

actividade é caminhar ou excursionismo; 4. Acessibilidade através de barco e/ou canoa; 

5. Visibilidade; 6. Segurança em caso de acidente; 7. Segurança no sítio e no seu 

respectivo acesso; 8. Sinalização; 9. Uso actual do sítio em termos de interesse 

geológico/histórico; 10. Uso do sítio para outros tipos de interesse; 11. Limitações de 

uso do sítio; 12. Limpeza; 13. Instalações sanitárias; 14. Restaurantes; 15. Alojamento; 

16. Transportes públicos; 17. Estética e 18. Potencial interpretativo. Os resultados 

obtidos foram divididos em cinco categorias para uma melhor organização: Insuficiente 

(resultados entre 0% e 49% e 0 – 4.8 pontos); Suficiente (valores entre 49.5% - 69% e 

4.9-5.9 pontos); Bom (resultados entre 69.5% - 79% e 6 – 7.9 pontos); Muito Bom 

(resultados entre 79.5% - 89% e 8 – 8.9 pontos) e Excelente (resultados entre 89.5%- 

100% e 9-10 pontos). Foi possível verificar que o valor turístico médio dos geosítios e 

sítios históricos do ouro não é muito elevado, sendo incluído na categoria “Suf?c??nt?” 

(com 58.34% e 5.86 pontos para os geosítios e 59.64% e 5.79 pontos para os sítios 

históricos do ouro). Os melhores resultados foram obtidos pelos outros sítios, com um 

valor médio incluído na categoria “Bom” (com 70.33% e 7.07 pontos). No total, os 

valores médios dos 57 sítios analisados são de 62.77% e 6.24 pontos, correspondendo à 

categoria “Suf?c??nt?” na metodologia da percentagem e à categoria “Bom” na 

metodologia dos pontos. Com base nos resultados obtidos no que diz respeito ao valor 

turístico e ao risco de degradação, algumas acções foram propostas no sentido de 

melhorar o valor turístico dos sítios.

1. Introduction 
 

1.1. Scope, goals and methods  
 
 This work has as main goal to create a quantitative assessment of the touristic 

value and the degradation risk of the 57 inventoried sites (24 geosites, 25 gold historical 

sites and 8 other sites) of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project. The quantification of 

the scientific value of the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites is not included 

though it could be added afterwards to a more effective management of the sites.  

Therefore this work has as main goals: 

? The touristic value assessment of the sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland 

project. 

? Development of proposals for valuing geotourism. 

 

The specific goals are: 

(i) characterization of the sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project; 

(ii) implementation of a quantitative methodology for the touristic value using 

criteria of use and vulnerability; 

(iii) development of interpretative material for the sites according to their 

touristic value; 

(iv) proposals of improvements in the sites (signs, access, infrastructures, among 

others); 

(v) proposal of interpretative trails according to the type of sites and their 

touristic value. 

 
 
 

1.2. Geoconservation, geotourism and geoparks  
 
Geoconservation is related with the need of conservation of a certain geosite 

where the value of the geosite and its threats are taken into consideration, being the 

geoparks an important tool to develop strategies of conservation (Brilha, 2005). The 

origins of the geoparks started in June of 2000 when it was created the European 

Geoparks Network (EGN) by four members: Resérve Géologique de Haute-Provence 



2 

 

(France); The Petrified Forest of Lesvos (Greece); Geopark Gerolstein/Vulkaneifel 

(Germany) and Maestrazgo Cultural Park (Spain), as a volunteer organization with 

mutual cooperation and founding from an European program, later under the auspices of 

UNESCO the program was extended to all world creating in this way the Global 

Geoparks Network (Carcavilla Urquí and García Cortés [no date]). On November 2015 

in the UNESCO General Conference, the 195 Member States of UNESCO ratified the 

creation of a new label The UNESCO Global Geoparks, until this moment there is 120 

UNESCO Global Geoparks in 33 countries (www.unesco.org).  

 

 

Figure 1.1. Global Geoparks Network (http://www.globalgeopark.org/). 

 

A geopark is a well-defined territory with clear boundaries where the 

outstanding Geological Heritage is the basis for a sustainable strategy to promote the 

well-being of the population and the respect for the environment (Carcavilla Urquí and 

García- Cortés [no date]). In this way the three main goals of a geopark are: 

? Geoconservation: creation of a strategy to preserve and promote the geosites as 

a way to protect the geological heritage for future generations 

(www.azoresgeopark.com). 

? Environmental education: creating knowledge and consciousness in 

population about the importance of the geological heritage as well as promoting 

http://www.unesco.org/
http://www.azoresgeopark.com/


3 

 

the scientific research and dissemination, the sharing of the information between 

scientists and local community (www.azoresgeopark.com). 

? Sustainable development: concerning for the creation of a sustainable 

development and well-being of local population, where the geotourism is the 

main key to give value to geological heritage and cultural heritage while benefits 

the well-being of the local population and where a good geotourism strategy can 

be sustainable (www.azoresgeopark.com). 

 

 

1.3. Sites value and assessment criteria 
 

For a correct and sustainable management of the geosites it is need to have a 

management plan made by six different stages: inventory, quantification, classification, 

conservation, promotion and monitoring (Brilha, 2005), the first two stages are related 

with the geosites assessment and the last four are related with their management 

(Pereira, 2006). This work is focused in the management (second part of the 

management plan) specifically in the touristic quantification of the 24 geosites, 25 gold 

historical sites and 8 other sites as well as their degradation risk of the Golden Geopark 

of Lapland project sites, selected previously in the inventory stage. The quantitative 

assessment of the scientific value of the 57 sites is not developed in this work.  

There are still few works related with the development of a quantitative 

methodology for touristic value like for example Pralong (2005), Rybár (2010), Pereira 

and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013). The present work will do an adaptation from 

the previous works done by Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013) with some 

adaptation to the reality of the Finnish Lapland.

2. Golden Geopark of Lapland Project 
 

2.1. Location and description of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project 
 

 

Figure 2.1. Location of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project (Golden Geopark of Lapland brochure [no date]). 

 

Lapland - located on north of Finland (Figure 2.1.) inside of the Arctic Circle 

and heart of a wilderness area – is home of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project. The 

geopark project has 5125 km2 of area, comprises two municipalities, Inari and 

Sodankylä, and it is home of 24 geosites, 25 gold historical sites and 8 other sites 

(Figure 2.2.), the geosites represent the ancient bedrock, gold deposits, the weathering 

processes and the Quaternary geology, and the gold historical sites and other sites the 

rich Gold History of Lapland, the Sámi Culture and a glimpse of the Lapland War. In 



5 

 

this far north where the geopark is located there is huge contracts during all year round 

being the summertime with the midnight sun while in wintertime is quite much the 

opposite, the night stays for couple months giving origin to the polar nights well known 

in Finnish language as “Kaamos”. Besides the contrasts between day and night, also it 

has a rich nature where in summer time the ground is made of ground-hugging shrubs, 

mosses and lichens, lakes and native birch and pine forest; in autumn the colors of 

nature turn to red and yellow  and the time when it starts to get dark – September - the 

best northern lights begin. In winter, which is the longest season of the year, everything 

is covered by snow, hard low temperatures that can reach sometimes -40 degrees 

Celsius and the sky gives dark and with luck the famous northern lights, the spring time 

the snow starts to melt and the lighter days announces the coming of warmer days.  

They were three projects with the aim to establish the Golden Geopark of 

Lapland being the first one in 2011-2012 under the administration of the Gold Museum 

Foundation; the second one from July until December of 2013 under the administration 

of Inari Municipal Business &amp;amp; Development Nordica and finally the third from January 

2014 until April 2015. After the projects, since January until December of 2015 the 

geopark project operated under Inari Municipal Business &amp;amp; Development Nordica and 

funded by Inari and Sodankylä municipalities and Metsähallitus. In September 2015 in 

the European Geoparks Network held in the only Finnish Geopark (Rokua Geopark) 

when announcing the new geopark members the Golden Geopark Project did not 

entered (www.goldengeopark.fi).

2.2. Geological Setting 
 

 In the area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project is possible to observe: a) a 

very old Precambrian bedrock, older than many geoparks in Middle and Southern 

Europe; b) weathering processes; c) the Ice Age that left its legacy on top of the old 

bedrock and d) the gold deposits that also created a huge historical background in 

Lapland. 

 The bedrock of northern Finland belongs to the Fennoscandian Shield, also 

called Baltic Shield (Figure 2.3.), which is an ancient shield area similar to the Canadian 

and Australian shields and it corresponds to the bottom of an ancient mountain range 

like the one nowadays in Alps. The Fennoscandian Shield is in south of Norway, 

eastern Finnmark, the southern and eastern parts of Sweden, all Finland and parts of 

northwest of Russia being the oldest rocks of this shield formed between 3.2 and 2.5 

billion years ago and occurred in eastern Finmark, north-eastern Finland and north-

western Russia. 

 



10 

 

 

Figure 2.3. “Geology and major structural units of the Fennoscandian shield. PAC—Primitive arc complex; WAC—

Arc complex of western Finland; SAC— Arc complex of southern Finland; CFGC— Central Finland granitoid 

complex; CLGC— Central Lapland granite complex; LGB—Lapland granulite belt. Right-diagonal ruling marks the 

nort??rn ???? of platform s???m?nts.” (From Koistinen et al. (2001) and Vaasjoki et al. (2005)). 

 

 The area of the Geopark of Lapland is in the Paleoproterozoic Lapland 

Greenstone Belt (LGB) where underlies the Archean rocks. The greenstone belts are a 

characteristic of all Archean terraces of the world (Vaasjoki et al., 2005) and the LGB is 

the largest coherent greenstone terrain exposed in the Fennoscandian Shield 

(Schlöglova et al., 2014) comprising northern Norway, the geopark area and finally 

Russia in Kola Peninsula (Johansson [no date]), with 400 km long and 90 km wide 

(Tuisku et al., 2006) being the main rock quartz feldspar gneiss (Figure 2.4.). The LGB 

has been affected by the intensive deformed and metamorphosed Svecokarelian orogeny 

(a continent-continent collision between the Karelian province and Kola province) of 

about 1.9 billion years ago where volcanic activity took place and the rocks went in the 

deep Earth´s crust suffering a tremendous pressure and heat, reason for the strong 



11 

 

foliation nowadays in the rocks. It was in this environment described before that gave 

origin to the rocks and its minerals in present day. The LGB also presents intercalations 

norites and enderbites (Barbey and Raith, 1990). In the southern part of the geopark it is 

possible to observe a younger rock, a granite intrusion of 1.77 billion years old, the 

Nattaset fells and on the margins of the Granulite belt garnet-hornblende gneiss and 

hornblende gneiss (Johansson [no date]). 

 The Svecokarelian orogeny, besides the rock types in the area of the geopark, 

created mountains chains that eroded down to its roots during hundreds of millions of 

years giving place to a peneplane - it is important to mention that the erosion and 

weathering processes were faster when Finland was in southern parts of the globe 

(Johansson [no date]; Tikkanen, 2002). In 30-50 million years ago, in Tertiary period, 

there were block movements that made the fells rose above their surrounding area and 

the fractures zones and faults formed at their edges originated valleys like Ivalojoki, 

Lemmenjoki, Tolosjoki, among others.

Figure 2.4. Lapland Greenstone Belt (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application). 

 

 The history of the rocks in this area is far from its end, a very important factor 

happened here as well, the weathering. The rocks suffered chemical and mechanical (or 

physical) weathering during millions of years, which made the granulite rock into loose 

material, in some places the rock is so loose that is possible to excavate it with a shovel 

(Johansson et al., 2009).  Many of this weathering, known as frost weathering, can be 



13 

 

seen on the tops of upper slopes of the fells where it is possible to observe a field of 

blocks, this happened when the water enters in fractures of the rock, freezes, increases 

its size and after that breaks the surface of the rock, examples of geosites are the geosite 

number 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells, geosite number 19. The Rahajärvi 

collapsed cliff and other example to observe is on top of the Jäkäläpää fell. Other rocks 

are more resistant against weathering, for example the geosite number 15. Tor 

formations at Pyhä-Nattanen where the weathering has been slower than the 

surrounding area. In other areas the weathered rock, loosened by frost weathering, falls 

from vertical canyon walls and stays in the shores of the rivers like it happens on the 

geosite number 23. Talus deposit on the shore of Morgamjärvi lake. This process 

(weathering) is very slow in nature.  

 Also the ice age played a crucial rule here. The area has been place for many ice 

ages during the times, being the oldest signs of glaciation about 2.3 billion years ago 

(Luhta, 2003). The last glaciation, the Weichselian Glaciation, is responsible for many 

Quaternary deposits (the most common one is till), various landforms and erosional 

forms (Figure 2.5.). The Weichselian Glaciation started more than 110 000 years ago 

reaching its peak about 18 000-20 000 years ago and ended about 9000 years ago, 

having at least 10 different stages and the same amount of warm stages, called 

interglacial stage- nowadays we are living an interglacial stage. The northern Lapland, 

where the geopark project is, the ice melted in a supra-aquatic environment that resulted 

in erosional and depositional landforms (Johansson, 2007), different from what 

happened in central and southern parts of Finland, where in south existed subaquatic 

environment (Johansson, 2007). In this far north only small episodes of subaquatic 

environment happened here when the Arctic Ocean entered in the river valleys of Teno 

and Lutto and into the Inari Lake basin (Nikonov 1964, Saarnisto 1973, cited in 

Johansson, 2007 p. 48).

Figure 2.5. Quaternary  deposits in the area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland ( Golden Geopark of Lapland 
Application). 

 

Some examples of evidences of the ice age: 



15 

 

Eskers: long, narrow hill of gravel and sand which is formed by waters that flow in the 

melting ice penetrating into cracks of the ice and depositing debris on the bottom of the 

meltwater tunnels. The eskers are in the same direction with the melting ice.  

Kames: small cone shaped hills made of sand and gravel by the streams on top of the 

glaciers.  

Subglacial gorges: very deep and narrow valleys with very steep valley side slope. It 

forms when the meltwater of the glaciers and its materials (debris) crosses a fell ridge 

and the rock on tunnel floor is already fractured, the water erodes it for a long time 

forming in this way deep gorges.  

Potholes: circular or cylindrical hole in the riverbed produced by the force of a very 

turbulent water and abrasion. Very turbulent quantities of melt water from a glacier and 

its sediments start to spin with the eddy and since it is greater than the resistance of the 

rock drills down forming in this way potholes.  

Lateral drainage: parall?l “l?n?s” an? slop? ??ntly ?ownwar? form?? ?ur?n? t?? 

deglaciation stage when the ice progressively got thinned each year and eroded a 

channel in the slope parallel to the edge of the ice (Johansson et al., 2009). This 

happened   between the ice margin of the glacier and the adjacent hillside.   

Overflow channels: formed when the ice sheet starts to melt and the meltwater 

accumulates between the ice sheet and the lowest parts of the fell, eroding what is in 

their way and creating deep gorges (Johansson et al., 2009). 

Aapa mires: areas with large watery flarks and its middle parts without trees, also there 

are between them low ridges called strings (Johansson [no date]). This type of mire is 

formed when the ice melts and dead plants starts to accumulate in the wet environment 

and during thousands of years originates a peat. They can be found in depressions in the 

landscape and in areas with water between hills for example.  

Hummocky moraines:  also named as dead-ice moraine or moraine mounds are a 

group of moraines with no specific orientation or organization, size, spacing or slope.  

Glacial deltas: formed when streams of meltwater coming from the ice entered into the 

lakes or when it is associated with an esker chain, being the delta in this way the final 

stage of the esker formation. 



16 

 

Marginal channels: formed in the margin of the ice sheet the same way as the lateral 

drainage, the difference between both rely on the fact that in the marginal channels the 

quantity of water is much bigger.  

Erratics: a rock/ boulder transported and deposited by a glacier in a different area than 

the original having in this way a different lithology than the bedrock.  

 To finalize the geological setting it is crucial to mention the gold plays a very 

important rule in this area in terms of geology as well as history. Gold is a yellow and 

shinning precious metal, being one of the heaviest metals in nature and considered to be 

a “nobl?” m?tal (an alc??m?st?c t?rm) b?caus? ?t ?o?s not ox???z? un??r or??nary 

con??t?ons. Its c??m?cal symbol ?s “Au” from t?? Lat?n wor? “aurum” an? ?t ?s a ?oo? 

conductor of electricity and heat. The gold also is used in many other areas such as 

jewelry, gilding, dentistry, coins, aircraft-aerospace industry, arts, medical and chemical 

fields and electronics.  

 It is believed this precious metal has extraterrestrial origin which means that 

gold is formed when a supernova star explodes or collides and creates all heavier 

elements beyond iron (Fe), where the atoms of the gold originated as well. An 

interstellar gas cloud travels into the space and ended up in Earth at about 4.6 billion 

years ago. When the Earth was not in a solid state gold and other heavier elements went 

to the centre of the Earth, while lighter elements stayed on the surface.  

 The gold was formed during millions of years where it precipitated on the ocean 

floor or into deep volcanoes and it was able to rise high in the mountains. The 

weathering and erosion in the mountain region during a period of hundreds of millions 

of years and in the Tertiary Period when block movements made the fells rose above 

their surroundings the gold nuggets detached from the weathering rocks and ended up in 

the crustal faults (Halla and Wuthenau, 2015).  

 Other ore formations processes, besides the orogenic (above explained), forms 

the gold in Lapland, like for example porfyric, hypotermic, mesotermic, epitermic, 

sedimendic, among others. The sedimentic process has a sub-group, the placer process, 

which is divided in many placers but here the most important are the glasifluvial, glasial 

and alluvial to understand the journey of the gold in this area. Even though there is 

placer gold formations, until today was not found their mother lodges (primary ores).

2.2.1. Geosites description 
 

1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops: in the Ivalojoki canyon is possible to 

observe the strong schistose appearance and mineral content of the granitic gneiss and 

quartz diorite gneisses resulted of the tremendous pressure and heat the rock suffered.  

When hiking the 12 km trail from Pahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village visitors can 

see this geosite, also on the other side of the river, when crossing the suspension bridge 

that links the two shores is possible to visit the Kultala Gold Village (Golden Geopark 

of Lapland Application [no date]). 

2. Potholes at Ivalojoen Kultala: the potholes here are about 0.1-1.2 metres deep and 

with a diameter vary between 0.2 and 1.5 metres. They were formed by the last ice age 

about 11,000 years ago in the marginal zone of the melting ice sheet produced by the 

force of the very turbulent water and abrasion where boulders carried by those waters 

started to spin with the eddy and since this force is greater than the resistance of the 

rock drills down forming in this way the potholes. It is possible to see this geosite under 

the suspension bridge that leads to Kultala Gold Village, the geosite belongs to the 12 

km trail from Pahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: this esker is part of an esker sequence 

over 100 km long that extends from south-west to north-east towards Inari Lake and the 

village of Nellim. From Ritakoski Gold Village down to the river valley, the esker ridge 

enlarges into a valley train. This originates due to the glacial river that transports the 

sediments and deposited on the bottom of the valley, these eskers reach the surface level 

at about 155 m, w??c? ?s t?? wat?r l?v?l of t?? anc??nt ?c? lak? at Inar?. “When the level 

of the water later lowered, the Ivalojoki river began to carve its channel through the 

gravel and sand deposits.” (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

4. The Saarnaköngäs rapids: on the western side of the Ivalojoki river bank there is a 

large pothole carved in the cliff, also there are more potholes on the banks of the river 

which depths vary between 0.1 and 0.3 metres and with diameters of 0.2 -0.7 metres. 

Saarnaköngäs ?n F?nn?s? m?ans “s?rmon rap??s” ?u? to t?? fact t?at ?t ?s b?l??v?? t?? 

priest used this pothole to deliver his sermons to the gold-prospectors of the area 

(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 



18 

 

5. The Ainikkaharju esker: it is an esker ridge of 7 km long belonging to a long esker 

sequence that extends from south-west to north-east towards the Ivalojoki river valley. 

It was formed when the debris were transported on the bottom of the meltwater channel 

and after that deposited as an elongated ridge of gravel and sand (Golden Geopark of 

Lapland Application [no date]). 

6. The Puoliväli spring: springs occur mostly on the lower slopes of fells, hills and at 

the foot of eskers when the groundwater reaches the ground surface (Johansson et al., 

2009). At the bottom of Patatunturi fell the waters of Puoliväli spring goes in its way to 

the surface through the sandy layers on the bottom. This geosite is in the 12 km trail 

from Pahaoja to Gold Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

7. The Kulmakuru gorge: this gorge has an angular form as a result of the crossing 

fracture zones in the bedrock, it is a gorge more than 20 metres deep with very steep 

slopes and in the bottom is covered with jagged stones that have fall down from the 

slopes. Also in this area there is a small esker ridge formed in the meltwater conduit at 

the bottom of the retreating glacier that goes into the Kulmakuru meltwater gorge at the 

375 m level and runs further to the Eskottijoki river valley where there are again 

glaciofluvial hillocks, proving in this way that esker ridges and this gorge belong to the 

same sub-glacial meltwater system (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

8. The Kiilopää ice lake and its spillways: when continental ice sheet from the last 

glaciation was melting, about 10, 500 years ago, the ground started to be exposed and 

the water was collected into ice lakes between the margin of the glacier and the fells, 

like it happen in Kiili-oja river valley. This ice lake discharged its waters over the 

lowest points of the fell range towards northeast eroding deep gorges (overflow 

channels) into the bedrock (Johansson et al., 2011). North of Kiilopää exists a series of 

overflow channels at heights between 446 m and 336 m which functioned one after the 

other as a discharge channel for the Kiilopää ice lake (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

9. The Rumakuru gorge: this gorge due to its orientation and location was formed 

early than the melting stage of the last glaciation, when the last glaciation was in his 

area it was not able to destroy it or fill it, with the exception of the floors and slopes 

which are partially covered by a thin blanket of till. This gorge has 50 metres deep 



19 

 

because of the long time of erosion made by the meltwater and the underlying rock was 

already fractured (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  

10. The quartz vein at Hangasoja: when the gold in the riverbanks started to be scarse 

the attention turned to the gold in the bedrock. In this way in 1898, a geological 

expedition was send to search for minerals in Lapland and it was found close to 

Hangasoja brook a spot where a white quartz vein cut through the syenite bedrock, 

considering this a very promising chance for gold prospecting, the gold miner Henry 

Kerkelä had the information and made a claim in the place in May of 1902. This geosite 

belong to the Laanila Gold trail were is possible also to see some historical sites 

(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

11. The Nälkäaapa mire: this mire was formed in the depressions of the terrain and in 

waterlogged areas that were left as the glacier melted. Remnants of dead plants 

accumulates on the humid substrate and during a period of thousands of years several 

metres of peat were formed by the process of huminification (Johansson, 2009). The 

mire, like the others, is an open bog without tress in the middle, watery flarks and 

between them  low ridges called strings.  

12. The Kopsusjärvi delta: is a glaciofluvial delta that was formed at the margin of the 

continental ice sheet. There is an esker chain running from south-west representing the 

final stage of the esker formation, and the delta is composed by sand and gravel material 

rising 315 metres above sea level (refers to the water level elevation in the Kopusjärvi 

ice lake during the deglaciation). The sides of the delta are steep and the surface flat 

(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  

13. Lateral drainage channels at Teräväkivenpää: “glacial meltwater channels 
which are almost parallel and slope gently down the sides of the fell.” (Ann?x?s, 

Golden Geopark of Lapland [no date]). Each channel is few hundreds of metres to a 

kilometre long, open at the both ends, 1-3 metres deep and having a distance between 

them that varies between 10 and 20 metres. The lateral channels are very important for 

calculat? t?? annual r?tr?at of t?? ?c? mar??n. “They were formed in spring by meltwater 

flowing from the ice sheet and eroding a channel in the slope parallel to the edge of the 

ice. When became thinner in summer, its surface sank a few metres. The next spring a 

new channel was again formed below the preceding one.” (Jo?ansson ?t al., 2009).

14. Melt water erosional forms on Tankavaara fell: when the deglaciation came to 

this area the waters from the glacier crossed Tankavaara fell under an huge pressure that 

carried away rock material that eroded from the walls and the bottom of the gorge and 

were deposited at its mouth. Marginal channels were formed later and since the amount 

of water flowing in those channels was huge originated channels with several metres 

deep and frequently over a kilometre long (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no 

date]). 

15. Tor formations at Pyhä-Nattanen: is a group of high cone shaped hills in Sompio 

Nature Reserve with about 500 metres high being the highest Terävä-Nattanen with  

544 metres, it belongs to a 1. 77 billion years old granite intrusion that is one of the 

youn??st rock typ?s ?n t?? ar?a. “The Nattaset fells consist of red, coarse-porphyritic or 

even-grained, homogeneous granite that is composed of plagioclase, quartz and K-

feldspar in equal proportions. Biotite is the main mafic mineral and accessory phase 

include magnetite, allanite, titanite, and zircon” (Front ?t al., cited in Johansson et al., 

2014, p.34). These tors probably belong to the most durable parts of the granitic rock, 

being the weathering process slower here than in the surrounding area. There is an 

hiking trail to this geosite (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: the frost weathering that occurs in this area 

makes the surface of the rock shrink and expand forming in this way small fractures, 

after this the water penetrates on these fractures freezes and widens breaking the rocks. 

This is what happened in this geosite, and still going on in a very slow process. There is 

a hiking trail to see this geosite as well as to geosite number 15 (Golden Geopark of 

Lapland Application [no date]). 

17. Karhunpesäkivi: in En?l?s? m?ans t?? “b?ar´s D?n Rock” and it is situated near the 

lake Myössäjärvi in Inari on the slope of Myössävaara hill and it is well-known for 

being the largest cavity of a tafone weathering formation in Finland. When the 

continental ice sheet flowed to the area, from the southwest, carried with it many 

erratics in its melting process, one of the most famous and largest is the Bear´s Dan 

Cave with 6m x 6m x 4m in outer extend and 2m x 2m x 3m inside cavity (Johansson et 

al., 2014). It is formed through tafoni weathering mainly by disintegration due to the 

differences in temperature between the surface of the cavity and the inner rock, the 

changes in temperature and humidity still erode the walls of the cavity (Kielosto et al. 

1985, cited in Johansson et al., 2014, p. 56). This erratic was before mistaken as a 



21 

 

pothole that had been turned upside down. It is possible to visit the inside of the erratic 

through a hole, there are stairs that lead to this geosite and it is not far from a parking 

car area. 

18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs: this area is characterized by tens of 

hills and ridges of 5 -15 metres high and composed by very stony and blocky till. The 

stones are angular, originating from the local bedrock meaning that the rock underneath 

is fractured and the glacial erosion in the area was very strong mixing till with the 

angular rocks. (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

19. The Rahajärvi collapsed cliff: this geosite is a result of physical weathering. When 

there are differences of temperature the surface of the rock expands and contracts 

alternately resulting in this way in small fractures in the rock. When it rains the water 

enters in this fractures and when temperatures are below zero the water freezes and 

expands in the fractures, after this the fracture becomes so big that the rock splits and 

the break piece rolls down to the bottom of the slope and spilt into dozens of pieces. 

This process is very slow (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

20. The Sotkajärvi esker and kames: this esker is part of a long esker sequence, 150 

km, running from south-west to north-east rising in Lemmenjoki canyon about 30 

metres. “At Njurkulahti, the unbroken, steep-sided ridge enlarges into rolling kame 

topography consisting of several parallel ridges. Dead ice holes are found between 

them that formed as ice blocks transported by the meltwater stream were buried in the 

gravel.” (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

21. The Ravadasköngäs waterfall: this geosite has several falls in a row being 

originally an old glacial meltwater channel. In addition, there is in the upper part of the 

waterfall potholes-like forms made by the erosive action of the glacial meltwater in the 

final phase of the last glaciations. The Ravadasköngäs gorge and the 7 metre high 

waterfall cascade situated near the mouth of the Ravadasjoki river are a very famous 

destination in Lemmenjoki, being possible to see this geosite through a hiking trail or in 

an easier way by boat (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

22. A cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream: three small waterfalls with 

their steep and narrow channels indicating the brooks are young. The highest and most 

impressive is situated at the mouth of the Morgam-Viibus stream. (Golden Geopark of 

Lapland Application [no date]).  



22 

 

23. Talus deposit on the shore of Morgamjärvi lake: the talus deposit on the south-

eastern shore of Morgamjärvi lake are the result of the physical weathering, having the 

material fallen from the vertical canyon walls and came to the lower parts of the canyon 

forming in this way talus deposits. Rock and snow avalanches in late winter are also 

common events in this area.  

24. Lateral drainage channels on the top of the Jäkäläpää fell: “glacial meltwater 

channels which are almost parallel and slope gently down the slopes of the Jäkäläpää 

fell” (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).). Each channel is a few 

hundreds of metres to a kilometre long, open at the both ends and 1-3 metres deep. The 

lateral channels are very important for calculate the annual retreat of the ice margin. 

“They were formed in spring by meltwater flowing from the ice sheet and eroding a 

channel in the slope parallel to the edge of the ice. When became thinner in summer, its 

surface sank a few metres. The next spring a new channel was again formed below the 

preceding one.” (Jo?ansson ?t al., 2009).

2.3. Gold History: Past and Present 
 

 Even though the discovery of gold in Lapland had a shy start with some failed 

attempts (the oldest reference about gold dates back in 1546 by Georg Agricola), its 

official beginning came much later, in 1868 in Ivalojoki River and continued after that 

in other areas like Lemmenjoki, Laanila and Tankavaara bringing a new fascinating 

chapter in Lapland History. Nowadays visitors can see some buildings, ruins, engines, 

shafts, piles of stones, among others in the gold fields throughout the good hiking trails 

in the area, like for example Lemmenjoki trail (49, 20 km all hiking route, shorter if 

visitors take boat and hike for a while), Pahaoja – Kultala Gold Mining Village trail (12 

km) and the Golden Route of Laanila  (8.10 km); pan for gold in some places and 

understand a little bit more of gold history thanks to the International Gold Museum of 

Tankavaara.   

Ivalojoki: the gold was found in 1868 in Nulkkamukka by Joahn Conrad Lihr (a mining 

engineer and the manager of the Mint) and his team and the gold rush reached its climax

in 1880s (http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm). The gold historical sites possible 

to foun? ??r? ar?: 1. Gol? Prosp?ctors’ Huts at t?? Mout? of Kylä?ok?; 2. Ru?kanmutka; 

3. The Lappi Farm at the Mouth of the Appisjoki; 4. Kultala Crown Station; 5. The 

River Bank of the Sotajoki Confluence; 6. The Liljeqvist Dredge and its Surroundings; 

7. R?takosk?’s Kultala Gol? V?lla??; 8. R?takosk? st?am ?n??n?; 9. Pals?no?a (Raa?? 

cabin); 10. Nulkkamukka - the Birth Place of the Gold Rush; and 11. Kultala (Gold 

Village) along Pahaoja Brook. 

Laanila: here was the place for mining companies like the Finnish companies 

Prospektor, Kerkelä, Lapin Kulta Oy and Ivalojoki Oy and some foreign as well trying 

to search for the mother lodge of gold in the first decades of the 20th century. The 

companies entered in bankrupt after few years of activity giving place to individual gold 

prospectors and until nowadays individual people search for gold in this area 

(http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm). The gold historical sites possible to found 

here are: 12. The Kerkelä mining village; 13. The Laanila white quartz rock and shaft; 

14. The Kuivakuru panning fac?l?ty; 15. G?n?ral’s m?n? s?aft; 16. Carl Gustaf m?n? 

shaft (all sites before b?lon??n? to Laan?la´s ?ol? tra?l) an? f?nally 17. Prosp?ctor’s m?n? 

shaft. 

Tankavaara: the gold was found by a local person called Aslak Peltovuoma (a smith 

and joiner) in 1934 (http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm). Nowadays the area has 

the Gold Village with restaurant and accommodation and the Gold Museum. In his 

museum visitors can find the history of gold in Lapland and in other countries around 

the world and some temporary exhibitions are developed, like for example the one 

which explains geologically the origin of gold in Lapland. Besides these two 

infrastructures – Gold Village and Museum- a Mineral exhibition and “Auraria” (a 

square with scale model replicas of buildings from gold rush centres all over the world) 

can be seen in Tankavaara. The place also has every summer the Finnish Gold Panning 

Championships where Finnish people and foreigners can participate and the general 

public can see the competitions. The gold historical sites possible to found here are: 19. 

The memorial to Sauva-Aslak and a little far from Tankavaara, 18. The old cabin at 

Suomunruoktu in Urho Kekkonen National Park. 

Lemmenjoki: this area had its first gold experience in 1902 without any further 

success, being after that forgotten for four decades.  Only in 1945 when three brothers, 

Niilo, Uula and Veikko Rantilla found gold in the tributary Morgamoja (Lemmenjoki) 

http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm

this area entered in the gold History of Lapland 

(http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm). The gold historical sites possible to found 

here are: 20. Kultahamina; 21. The site where gold was first found; 22. Morgamoja 

Kultala; 23. P??la?amäk?; 24. Kar?u Kor?on?n’s L?brary an? 25. Kor?on?n. 

 

2.3.1. Gold Historical Sites description 
 

1. Gold Prospectors’ Huts at the Mouth of Kyläjoki: Viktor Koivula settled here in 
1972 to dig gold, the cottages built by this gold prospector are already decaying. Near 

this place, at the Timanttiköngäs rapids there is a traditional Sámi-style dwelling, a 

“Kammi”, which has been dug partially underground and lined with timber and peat 

also there is a sauna and an underground cellar (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]).  

2. Ruikanmutka: this place has been one of the most productive gold sites on the river 

Ivalojoki. Here many gold prospectors staked their claims due to its richness, being 

Unto Koivunen the most recent permanent gold prospector in this area living in his 

cabin all year round. It is possible to s?? t?? r?ma?ns of Ko?vun?n’s ol? ?ut, 

chimneyless sauna, cold cellar, shed and outhouse in Ruikanmutka. The newer hut 

burned down in 1995. Also here was built a big house but few evidences have been 

preserved until these days, the house belonged to Matti Yliruikka which found so much 

gold that made him able to build here a house (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application 

[no date]). 

3. The Lappi Farm at the Mouth of the Appisjoki: in this place lived the Lappish 

family of Gabriel Aikio at the beginning of the 20th century. Gabriel sold food and other 

supplies to local gold prospectors who paid their purchases in gold (Launonen and 

Partanen, 2000). According to the legend, he hid his gold by the path running from the 

mouth of Appisjoki to Kultala. Only two more people knew it where it was, his 

farmhand and his maid, when Gabriel died the maid went in search for the treasure and 

found it but gave her such a fright that she fled from the side. Until this day the gold is 

still there if the rumors are truth. This place is in ruins  (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm


29 

 

4. Kultala Crown Station: on the spring of the year 1868 the Senate send an official 

expedition led by Joahn Conrad Lihr, a mining engineer and the manager of the Mint, to 

explore the rivers of Lapland to find gold and on September of the same year the 

precious metal was found on the River Ivalojoki in a place called Nulkkamukka 

(http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm), giving in this way birth to the gold rush in 

Lapland. The gold rush in Ivalojoki took about 3 summers with an amount of 500 gold 

diggers, some of them were lucky enough to get 2 kilos of gold in a short period of time 

(couple weeks). With the huge number of prospectors in the area it was necessary to 

keep the order and support people´s needs in the gold fields, in this way in 1870 on the 

bank of Ivalojoki river many infrastructures were created like for example the Kultala 

Crown Station, the headquarters for government officials to control the area (e.g.: 

issuing licenses for gold prospecting, purchased all the gold recovered on the claims, 

plotted maps of the claims, etc.), as well as a sauna, a saloon, a bakery, log cabins to 

accommodate gold prospectors and a small hospital built further down on this river. 

When the gold rush was over, the Kultala building was renovated to serve as an 

investigation centre for Finnish geophysicists to study northern lights in 1882. It is 

possible to visit this place and see the buildings through the 12 km hiking trail from 

Pahaoja to Kultala Gold Mining Village (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no 

date]). 

5. The River Bank of the Sotajoki Confluence: at the mouth of Sotajoki people have 

been here to prospect for gold since the early days of the gold rush (1870s). The first 

person to stake a claim at the mouth of Sotajoki was Johan Tallgren from Helsinki being 

the results of the first 10 years over 30 kilos of gold. In 1879 Tallgren sold his claim to 

a baker, Fredrick Ekberg, founder of Helsinki´s well-known Ekberg´s coffee house. At 

the end of the 1880s the northern bank of the mouth of Sotajoki was claimed by 

Xenofon Nordling the head of the Ivalo-Sotajonen huuhdontayhtiö gold panning 

company where several-kilometre-long ditches along which water was led from the 

Sotajoki to the panning site and huge piles of rock, the ruins of the cabins and huts also 

probably date back to those days. Also two mining companies, Prospector Oy and 

Ivalojoki Oy, worked in this area (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  

6. The Liljeqvist Dredge and its Surroundings: the engineer Toivo Liljeqvist built 

this large dredger (known also as “t?? ??nosaur”) ?n 1953-54 in Tolonen and dragged it 

along a cable wire upstream to the Vaskisuvanto backwater, it had a bucket and an 

http://www.kultamuseo.fi/en/historia.htm


30 

 

extractor operated by a diesel-powered engine. It was believed the machine could 

collect gold from the river that was left in the ground from digging by hand but the 

dredge did not worked as planned. The dredge was abandoned being gradually damaged 

by the years and floods in spring time, fortunately in 1992 this incredible machine was 

restored. Nowadays is possible to see this machine on the shore of Vaskisuvanto 

(Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  

7. Ritakoski’s Kultala Gold Village: Ritakoski has been a very important location for 
gold prospecting. Feodor Oesterreich of Saint Pertersburg was the first who staked a 

claim in this area, quitting quite soon after his bad results of prospecting. The busiest 

times came with Heikki Kivekäs in 1914 who had big plans to this place, building all 

kinds of houses in the place like for example a cowshed, stable and a barn as well as a 

sauna, a mining cabin, a timber hut, a workshop, a peculiar dog house that stood on a 

pedestal, a sawmill and a planning mill. He also started to build his own gold village but 

he never managed to finish. After Kivekäs was the time for mining companies like for 

example Ivalojoki Oy and Luttojoen Kulta Oy, the second company mentioned here 

employed, among others, Laura Francisca Elvira Bono, known as Moppe. She was a 

wife of a famous Finnish painter, she had a private little cabin at the bank of Ritakoski. 

(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). Of the old buildings in this area, the main building, a 

storehouse and the cowshed and stable were restored being the storehouse used as a hut 

for hikers. The doghouse and the log restroom also can been seen until nowadays, the 

rest of the buildings are in ruins around the place.  

8. Ritakoski steam engine: the steam engine was made by the English company R. 

Garret &amp;amp; Sons Engineers from Leiston with the main goal of starting a major mining 

activity. This machine was carried to Ritakoski during winter time, through a wide path 

stamped by reindeers, in a sleigh transported by horses and the river Ivalojoki was 

crossed on the ice. The steam engine is in an open shelter possible to be visited (Golden 

Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

9. Palsinoja (Raahe cabin): Palsinoja is a tributary of the river Ivalojoki, having the 

gold history started here in 1871 when an engineering student, Johan Albert Piponious, 

staked a claim along Palsinoja, near the mouth of the tributary, and panned almost 100 

grams of gold in the first few days. Next summer Piponius sold the claim to the police 

officer Xenofon Nordling who hired 25 men to work on the claim and received 3.4 

kilograms in gold. Slightly higher upstream along Palsinoja, Anders Leppäluoto, a 



31 

 

sailor from Raahe, staked his claim in the summer of 1873 and had a crew of eleven 

people to dug up more than two kilos of gold at the claim. The workers from Raahe left 

behind a hut, known as Raahen Pirtti, on the site. The hut was renovated in 1980 decade 

and again in 2012 serving today as a Metsähallitus rental hut and other remnants of old 

buildings built by the men from Raahe can be seen in the area. A road to Palsinoja was 

built in 1980 decade and a former helicopter pilot, Heikki Korhonen, established a 

tourism centre and an automated gold panning facility by the river, the business was a 

success but in autumn of 1985 the Katriina cabin that served as the touristic café burned 

down coming to an end his career in this area. Until today gold prospectors continue to 

work in Palsinoja (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

10. Nulkkamukka - the Birth Place of the Gold Rush: the Senate of the then Grand 

Duchy of Finland send an expedition led by Johan Conrad Lihr, assistant Director of the 

Mint and mining engineer, in 1868 to explore the big rivers of the north in hopes to find 

gold. On 16th of September of 1868 gold was found and a new chapter in Ivalojoki 

region started with this. With the discovery of gold in this area, the International Gold 

Prospector Museum of Tankavaara erected in 1986 a monument in honour of Lihr, 

located about 300 metres up-stream from the mouth of Louhioja and it can be seen until 

nowadays (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

11. Kultala (Gold Village) along Pahaoja Brook: gold digging in the area became 

more efficient when the company Lapin Kulta Oy built a base in this area in 1925. The 

gold prospecting through machines made that railways, bucket conveyors and steam 

power machines were transported here, unfortunately without success - not much gold 

was found and rocks made the mechanical digging difficult. In 1948 a team of gold 

prospectors, Jaakko Isola, Heikki Kokko, Kullervo Korhonen and Jukka Pellinen in 

high hopes to find more gold collected an huge amount of land mines, grenades and 

other explosives abandoned by the German army few years earlier. The explosives were 

dug into a long row, wired together to explode and for the explosion it was used a 

bicycle dynamo. This experiment was not succeed as expected and these gold 

prospectors moved the following year to the gold fields of Lemmenjoki (Launonen and 

Partanen, 2000). The 300 metre channel that was exploded across a spit of land 

downstream from Pahaoja brook is an evidence of their activities that can be still seen 

until nowadays. As this place was abandoned when other areas in Lapland were more 

appealing to search for gold, the buildings fell into ruin and in 1970s by the initiative of 



32 

 

the Lapin Kultala Foundation, the National Board of Antiquities renovated the buildings 

and a shelter was built for the steam engine and a suspension bridge across the River 

Sotajoki, also a trail was created (12 km long) to link this place with Kultala Crown 

Station. To see this site, visitors walk short path and easy and is quite near to a parking 

place (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).   

12. The Kerkelä mining village: t?? ma??c wor? “?ol?” spr?a? ?n t??s ar?a and gold 

mining companies came to try their luck. Henry Kerkelä (an experienced gold 

prospector who worked as a miner in America and searcher for rock gold in the 

Ivalojoki gold fields) founded the Kerkelän Kultakaivos Oy Pohjola gold company 

having in 1902 150 claims and employing 45 men but without any success (only 25 

grams of gold were found). Due to his failure, the shareholders hired Hans von Post, a 

mining engineer, from Stockholm to inspect the job sites and Hans after take several 

samples conclude that there was a very few amount of gold in the area. Even though the 

results were unsatisfactory, von Post advised to Kerkelä continue to prospect because 

his lack of success may have been due to this lack of experience, inadequate equipment 

and the methods used. The report made by von Post did not convince the partners and 

the business was closed, still some of the shareholders had faith in Kerkelä and he was 

able to establish another mining company that soon proved to be hopeless. Kerkelä 

managed to sell his mine in 1906 to the Finnish-American Mining company, involving 

the Joutsen brothers, two men who had struck it rich in Klondike gold fields. This 

collaboration ended up in the courthouse of Inari, where  the company was sued for 

hundreds of thousands of marks in unpaid shares. The six mine shafts in the area and 

remnants of a dam and a building of Kerkelä can be seen in this area through the 7 km 

trail, Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]; Launonen 

and Partanen, 2000). 

13. The Laanila white quartz rock and shaft: the discovery of gold brought many 

people into the gold fields to try their luck and also the curiosity to find the mother 

lodge. In 1898 the geologist J.J. Sederholm detected syenite and quartz seams that cut 

across each other by the Hangasoja brook and decided it could be better to have a look 

in this area. When Kerkelä was in the area he had a mine shaft that reached a depth of 

10 metres and he said he had seen quartz, iron glance and gold in the cracks of the 

granulite gneiss. Before other people could prove what he was saying the shaft filled 

with water. Kerkelä dug another 125 metres from the previous one and found large 



33 

 

amounts of gold, in this way he continued to dig more shafts finding iron ore seams and 

send the samples to be analyzed. The analyzes concluded that the gold in the samples 

was significant and people believed in the mother lodge of Lapland. This gold historical 

site belongs to the 7 km Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application 

[no date]). 

14. The Kuivakuru panning facility: this gold historical site is one of the most famous 

and richest gold panning areas, being many of the largest nuggets in Finnish gold 

prospecting history found here. Here is possible to observe ruins of several old cabins 

and a newer one built in 1960s and still used by gold prospectors in 2000s, as well as 

steam-powered machines and more modern ones. This site belongs to the 7 km Lannila 

Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

15. General’s mine shaft: gold digging is still an active activity in present days in 

nearby areas of this gold historical site. The mine mineral of the shaft is goethite having 

on the waste area of the shaft plenty of goethite crystals. This site belongs to the 7 km 

Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft: this site is located near Kuttura road, probably the name 

comes from Carl-Gustaf Standertskjöld, one of the shareholders of the mining company 

(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). The best samples were proven to have more than 50 

grams of gold per tonne. Digging was quite intensive in this site and the deepest shafts 

in the area are found here. In this way is possible to see here the shafts and pile of waste 

stone. This site belongs to the 7 km Laanila Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

17. Prospector’s mine shaft: the Prospektor Oy mining company was established in 
1901 influenced partially by the promising gold findings of Henry Kerkelä. The 

company acquired 470 claims with the goal of prospecting for rock and river gold. As in 

that time the place was in pure wilderness the company had to build living quarters for 

workers and clerks, laboratories and smelters. Other important detail to live in such a 

remote area was the creation of roads, organization of post and food deliveries and have 

educated engineers. In 1902 the company employed 78 men and the most important of 

the six shafts was in Laanila, which employed 30 men. As the company paid to its 

employees, the machinery as well as payments for research expeditions in America, the 

money problem started to appear and to solve it was needed to convince the 



34 

 

shareholders that more gold would be found. The company received more money and in 

this way more machines were bought and more workers hired. The mining focused 

mainly on the shafts by the Luttojoki and Hangasoja, reaching the Lutto shaft more than 

50 metres and the Carl Gustaf shaft by the Hangasoja more than 30 metres. The 

company ran out of money again despite the efforts and the mining company had to sell 

off its equipment and the funds collected from the selling and those collected from 

shareholders allowed the company close with honor. The trails in Saariselkä area and 

Lannila lead to this site. It is possible to see the Prospektor mining shaft which is inside 

of a cabin and in the surrounding area some objects and a pile of stones from the 

prospecting activity (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).  

18. The old cabin at Suomunruoktu: this site is in the Urho Kekkonen National Park 

and has witnessed many different uses. It is believed that originally was built as a sauna 

for gold prospectors in 1935 being in the following decade renovated for hiking 

purposes and in the war time was used as a military patrol base. Today is a historical 

site from the national park (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: in Tankavaara the gold was found thanks to a 

dream that Aslak Peltovuoma (a smith and joiner) had. In his dream there was an old 

man with white beard showing him a place to find gold. As he used crutches, Aslak sent 

his nephew  to the place he dreamt about but the boy came back without any gold 

(Launonen and Partanen, 2000). In this way Aslak went himself to the place and for his 

surprise he found gold and after his discovery the deposit of gold was worked by people 

from Aslak village and later outsiders also went to explore the place staking their claims 

here. 

20. Kultahamina: is the starting point for the Gold Trail in Lemmenjoki National Park. 

Here people can reach the site by tourist boat or by hiking (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

21. The site where gold was first found: Lemmenjoki had its first gold experience in 

1902 without any further success, being this area forgotten for four decades. Only in 

1945 when three brothers, Niilo, Uula and Veikko Rantilla found gold in the tributary of 

Morgamoja (Lemmenjoki), this area entered in the gold History of Lapland. With the 

discovery of gold by the three brothers the news spread out bringing in this way more 

gold prospectors to the area and originated the gold rush in Lemmenjoki. A small metal 



35 

 

plaque is mounted on a stone near the site of the discovery. The site belongs to the 

Lemmenjoki Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

22. Morgamoja Kultala: the site is famous for receiving four famous gold diggers, 

Jukka Pellinen, Heikkki Kokko, Kullervo Korhonen and Jaakko Isola. Being the cabin a 

central spot during the gold rush times it housed a post office, cafeteria and even a 

general store. From the original buildings, only the traditional Lapland storehouse, 

sauna and cellar still exist and the existing hut was constructed to resemble the old 

cabin. This belongs to the Lemmenjoki Gold Trail (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]).  

23. Pihlajamäki: this site is valuable for its old buildings and structures which includes 

the Pihlajamäki cabin, a traditional storehouse from Lapland, a sauna, a cellar for 

smoking fish and meat, a swing and a doghouse, besides this buildings and structures, 

gold prospecting objects are on display on the yard. A machine to prospect gold is still 

working in this area. People can reach this place by hiking (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]).  

24. Karhu Korhonen’s Library: near Jäkäläpää fell stands the former service building 
of the Jäkäläpää fell wilderness airfield owned by the Union of Lapland Gold 

Prospectors and the Finnish Transport Safety Agency/Trafi. This building is well known 

as “Kar?u Kor?on?n L?brary” or the Jäkäläpää Cultural Centre, having inside books that 

hikers can borrow and in return, if they want, leave their own books for others to read. 

Pictures about gold prospecting are in the walls. A trail leads to this site (Golden 

Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

25. Korhonen: this gold historical site has the cabin of the late gold prospector Yrjö 

“Kar?u” Kor?on?n an? it is the operational machine prospecting area of Joukko 

Korhonen. A trail leads to this site (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).

2.4. The land for indigenous people: The Sámi 
 

 The Sámi are a group of indigenous people living nowadays in northern and 

middle of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Kola Peninsula in Russia having their own 

languages, rich and colorful costumes, handicraft, traditions, sacred places, news and 

radio with their own language, a Sámi Parliament,  etc. It is believed that Sámi arrived 

to this far north even before the borders of the countries were formed and they lived 

from what the sea and forests gave to them. Nowadays there are about 72 000 Sámi 

GHS nº23 (a) GHS nº23 (b) 

GHS nº24 (a) GHS nº24 (b) 

GHS nº25 



44 

 

people, 40 000 in Norway, 20 000 in Sweden, 10 000 in Finland and 2 000 in Russia 

(Näkkäläjärvi and Aromäki, 2014). This indigenous people are more and more in 

tourism sector due to the recent decline in reindeer herding and the increase of interest 

on tourism entrepreneurship showed by younger Sámi (Pettersson, 2007). In this way 

Sámi people are in the tourism sector increasing and developing activities such as 

guiding, handicraft, exhibitions, among others and the area of the geopark is inside of 

their land. Actually one of the main Sámi towns is also inside of the geopark area, Inari 

village, and Siida Museum is a partner of the future geopark. This Museum which is a 

museum which shows to the visitors the culture of these indigenous people and the 

nature of northern of Lapland (the permanent exhibition) also it shows changing 

exhibitions on culture, art and nature all year round and in summer time there is an 

outside exhibition where visitors can find many different types of constructions like 

“kota”, house for horses, traps for some animal, house, etc. Also the geopark has some 

sites to represent the Sámi culture like for example the Ukonsaari Island, the Pielpajärvi 

Wilderness Church, the Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up and the ground of Kaapin Jouni 

site. 

 

2.4.1. Other Sites description 
 

1. The korkia-Maura Ice Cave: this cave is famous for its permafrost. The layer of ice 

on the bottom of the 15 metre long, 1-3.5 metre wide and 1.5-4 metre high cave never 

melted for hundreds of years. This kind of permafrost is called microclimatic permafrost 

and can be seen in caves, eskers and mines. This is formed when the winter cold is 

preserved throughout the summer, but in the recent years this cave has begun to thaw 

during summer due to the heat that visitors bring with them. This place also was known 

as a fish cellar for fisherman of Inarijärvi in the old times. This cave is in an island on 

the Lake Inarijärvi and in summer visitors can go to visit the cave with a local boat and 

in spring (when the ice is still hard) with skis (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application 

[no date]). 

2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site: this is a site representing the Sámi culture and 

the traditions of their ancestors like the reindeer husbandry. It comprises buildings and 

structures that gives the idea how people lived and still live. The fences and the cabins 

were restored in late 1980s and the structures are protected as a monuments to Sámi 



45 

 

reindeer husbandry with valuable industrial and cultural history. There is a 6 km hiking 

trail that leads to this place (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

3. The Pitfalls at the Sotkajärvi Ridge Chain: settlements in river valleys have been 

chosen since the prehistoric times. Here is possible to see signs of human activities from 

hundreds of years ago, being found about 700 pitfalls used for hunting wild forest 

reindeer until 1800s. In the village of Njurkulanti the main source of livelihood today is 

still reindeer herding and tourism. The trail to this place starts in Njurkulahti village and 

it is well-marked (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

4. Ruijanpolku trail: this trail has 35 km being the starting point in Laanila and its end 

in Sompiojärvi Lake. This trail was originally part of an ancient route named 

Ruijanreitti which before ran from the Botnian Bay, cross Saariselkä fell area and all the 

way to Finnmark by the Arctic Ocean, and it is believed to be the oldest route in 

Lapland (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).   

5. The Grounds of Kaapin Jouni: this site is the homestead of a famous Sámi family, 

being Jouni Aikio (better known as Kaapin Jouni) the most well-known man of the 

fam?ly. H? was t?? “r??n???r lor?” of ??s t?m? an? t?? ??a? of t?? fam?ly. H?s fam?ly 

was not the first who lived here, being the founder of the homestead Antti Juhaninpoika 

Morottaja, the homestead was established on late 19th century and remained occupied 

ever since. The last member of the founding family moved away from the homestead in 

2004. The buildings and the homestead are preserved. It is possible to see this place 

with local enterprises (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]). 

6. Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church: this church was built in 1760 and it is one of the 

oldest buildings in northern Lapland. This church is the old centre of the old winter 

village of Inari. This church and the nearby areas form a nationally valuable cultural 

heritage area. To reach this church there is a well- marked hiking trail with few 

kilometres (Golden Geopark of Lapland Application [no date]).    

7. Ukonsaari Island: this site is the most famous sacred place for worshiping amongst 

Sámi people in Finland. Families and individual people made sacrifices on this place 

until the 19th century and it is known that reindeer antlers were still brought here later. 

Fishermen, according with some legends, used to throw a coin in the Lake Inarijärvi 

close to this island and wish for fair winds. Also it was found a silver filigree head 

jewelry belonging to a lady´s circlet, which was not worn in Finland or in the rest of the 



46 

 

Nordic countries, similar jewelry was worn in Russia in 13th century and it is believed 

the circlet may have come in a barter deal to Inari 

(http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/ukonsaariisland). Today it is an important site to Sámi 

people, an archeological site and a touristic destination, been proposed to made into a 

UNESCO world heritage site for its cultural values. It is possible to visit this island 

through a boat connection from Inari village to the island (Golden Geopark of Lapland 

Application [no date]). 

8. Geological Trail: the trail has 7 km, is marked and presents information boards 

explaining the geology during the trail. In this trail hikers learn about the geological 

evolution of the area including information about gold as well as mires, weathered 

bedrock and Quaternary deposits formed by the continental ice sheet and its meltwaters 

(Johansson et al, 2014).

3. Touristic Value Assessment 

3.1. Methodology  

3.1.1. Touristic Value Assessment 

T?? scarc? numb?r of works r?lat?? to ??os?t?s’ tour?st?c valu? ass?ssm?nt may 

reflect the little attention that has been given to this subject by geopark managers and 

researchers. This work intends to be a contribution to that theme, following previous 

proposals by Pralong (2005), Rybár (2010), Pereira and Pereira (2012) or Gonçalves 

(2013). Regarding the reality and specificities of the Finnish Lapland environment, the 

applied methodology was slightly modified from these proposals, mainly from those of 

Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013).  

The touristic value assessment was applied to the 24 geosites, 25 gold historical 

sites and 8 other sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project and the same criteria, 

sub-criteria and scores (Table 3.1.) were used for all sites (57 in total) for a better 

comparison between them. Four main criteria were used: A. Availability, B. Use, C. 

Logistics and D. Perceptiveness (with some subjectivity, depending on the sensitivity 

and understanding by the person who is seeing the site). Each of the main criteria is 

divided in sub-criteria. The “A. Availability” criterion includes six or seven (depending 

if the site has boat and/or canoe access or not) sub-criteria: A.1 Seasonal Occupancy 

(Pralong, 2005); A.2. Terrestrial Accessibility; A.3. Availability according with 

people´s physical conditions when the activity is hiking or walking (adapted from 

Rybár, 2010); A.4. Boat and/or canoe access (optional); A.5. Visibility; A.6. Safety (in 

case of an accident); A.7. Safety in the geosite/gold historical site/other site and its 

access. The “B. Use” criterion includes four sub-criteria: B.1. Signage; B.2. The current 

use of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site in terms of geological/historical interest; 

B.3. The current use of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site for other interests and 

B.4. Use limitations of the geosite/ gold historical site/other site for other interests. The 

“C. Lo??st?cs” criterion includes five sub-criteria: C.1. Cleanliness, C.2. Toilets; C.3. 

Restaurants; C.4. Accommodation; and C.5. Local buses. The “D. Perceptiveness” 

criterion includes two sub-criteria: D.1. Aesthetics and D.2. Interpretative potential. A 

score ranging from 0 to 10 was used, where 0 is the minimum and 10 the maximum 



50 

 

points for each sub-criteria, making the total of 170 or 180 points (depending if a site 

has or not the boat/canoe access). 

From the criteria proposed by Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013) 

new sub-criteria were added. In the criterion “A. Availability” four new sub-criteria 

were created: A.1. Seasonal Occupancy, A.3. Availability according with people 

physical conditions when the activity is hiking or walking, A.4. Boat or canoe access, 

and A.6. Safety (in case of an accident). The sub-criterion “A.1. Seasonal Occupancy” 

had to be considered here since the Golden Geopark of Lapland has some sites that can 

be closed in winter time and sometimes in other seasons as spring and autumn due to 

the thick snow cover and the potential danger linked with that, like for example 

avalanches. It is also important to refer that, in some cases, when a site has open-access 

all year round it is very important to check every time the safety of the site when 

planning a trip. Sometimes the site can be safe to visit in winter but in some night or 

week it snowed more than the usual and it can happen to be closed due to the high 

quantities of snow, danger of an avalanche, trees possible falling due to the huge weight 

of snow, among others. In this sub-criterion it was not possible to check if the sites 

which are closed in winter time could be open in winter and if they were safe to be open 

in this time of the year. Other sub-criterion added in the criterion “A. Availability” was 

“A.2. Availability according with people´s physical conditions when the activity is 

hiking or walking”. It was important to add this sub-criterion since the area of the 

geopark is a wilderness area full of good hiking trails and most of the sites are far, 

requiring a hike to be seen. The addition of the sub-criterion “A.4. Boat and/or canoe 

access” was also considered necessary because some sites can be visited during summer 

time only by boat and/or canoe, like the case of  Korkia-Maura ice cave and Ukonsaari 

Island. Other sites can be visited by aquatic and terrestrial access, boat and/or canoe and 

by car or hiking. Unfortunately it was not possible to add a sub-criterion about the 

“availability according to people´ physical conditions when the activity is canoeing” 

like it was made for hiking and walking. Another item added was the criterion “A.6. 

Safety (in case of an accident)”, which is related with the possibility of a visitor to call 

an ambulance or go to a near hospital when suffering an accident. Even in the summer 

time it is possible to face some risks like for example getting lost. Wild animals like 

wolves and bears live in the area of the geopark but they weren´t take into account in 

this method since the attacks from those animals are extremely rare and they are afraid 



51 

 

of humans. In the criterion “C. Logistics” the sub-criterion “C.5.Local bus?s” was 

added, since the distances in Lapland are very long and the public transportation is 

scarce, worthing the consideration of this item. In the criteria “B. Use” and “D. 

Perceptiveness” the sub-criteria were the same used in the original proposal (Pereira and 

Pereira, 2012; Gonçalves, 2013).  

  Besides adding new sub-criteria, the items of some sub-criteria proposed in 

Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013) were changed to better adapt to the 

reality of Finnish Lapland. In the “A.2. Terrestrial accessibility” the ?t?m “t?? acc?ss to 

the geosite/gold historical site/other site is possible but the route in winter time is longer 

than the other used in the rest of the year” was added. It is due to the fact that some 

roads in winter are closed or transformed into snowmobile routes. Besides, the term 

“forest vehicle road” is used to describe those roads where cars can go but are made 

with gravel. In the sub-criterion “A.5. Visibility” t?? ?t?m “T?? v?s?b?l?ty of t?? 

geosite/gold historical site/other site is good to all or the most important 

geological/historical element(s) even with snow and darkness (in the dark it is used 

art?f?c?al l???t to obs?rv? t?? ??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?/ot??r s?t?)” was a????. The 

visibility in winter time was considered since some geosites/gold historical sites/other 

sites can be quite difficult to see in this time of the year while others are easily seen 

even in the dark hours and/or covered with snow, with a support of an artificial light. In 

the sub-cr?t?r?on B.2. “t?? curr?nt us? of t?? ??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal site/other site in 

t?rms of ??olo??cal/??stor?cal ?nt?r?st” ?t was ??c???? to join the internet promotion and 

the information board in same item “??os?t?/?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?/ot??r s?t? w?t? 

geological/historical promotion only in internet and leaflets, books, maps and/or in the 

site, e.g.: informat?on boar?”. R??ar??n? t??s, Gonçalves (2013) proposed that the 

information panels should be more valued than the internet and leaflets. Our proposal is 

related to the fact that mostly of the sites are in the wilderness far away from the main 

roads and putting there an information board could affect the sensation of wilderness 

Besides, the maintenance cost of this boards in such far areas is quite high. In the sub-

cr?t?r?on “B.3. The current use of the geosite/gold historical site/other site for other 

typ?s of ?nt?r?sts” the types of hiking trail, sky trail and boat and/or canoe route were 

considered, as well as their circularity by the possibility of the visitors to leave the car 

on the same place without doing an extra walk or route to get into the transportation. In 

the sub-criterion “C.1.Cl?anl?n?ss” som? a?aptat?ons were also considered as necessary 



52 

 

to be closer to the reality of Lapland. The infrastructures for making pic-nicks and the 

possibility to swim were desconsidered being only mentioned the existence of rubbish 

bins on or near the sites. In the sub-criteria “C.3. R?staurants” an? “C.4. 

Accommo?at?on” t?? influence of seasonality led to the necessity of adaptions because 

infrastructures like restaurants and hotels can be closed in specific times of the year. 

Other minor changes were made from the Pereira and Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves 

(2013) proposals, as presented in the Table 3.1.   

 

Table 3.1. Criteria, sub-criteria and scores: Touristic Value Assessment (adapted from Prereia and Pereira (2012) and

 The quantification of each geosite, gold historical site and other site was based 

on two numerical methodologies: points and percentage. The use of two numerical 

methodologies is important mainly to compare the similarity (or not) of the results. The 

points methodology considers a weight of 60 % to t?? cr?t?r?on “A. Ava?lab?l?ty”, 

where: 20% goes to “A.1 Seasonal Occupancy”; 2.5 % or 5% to “A.2. Terrestrial 

accessibility” (if the site has accesses by boat/canoe and terrestrial, the terrestrial 

accessibility will have 2,5% and the boat and/or canoe access 2.5%, if it has only one 

type of access – terrestrial - it will have 5%); 2.5% to “A.3. Availability according with 

people physical conditions when the activity is hiking or walking”, “A.4. Boat and/or 

canoe access” and “A.5. Visibility”; 15% to “A.6. Safety (in case of an accident)” and 

“A.7. Safety in the geosite/gold historical site/other site and its access”.  

A weight of 10 % is given to the “B. Us?” criterion, considering the sub-criteria “B.1. 

Signage”, “B.2. The current use of the geosite/gold historical site/other site in terms of 

geological/historical interest” and “B.3. The current use of the geosite/gold historical 

site/other site for other types of interests” with 2% each one and the sub-criterion “B.4. 

Use limitations of the geosite/gold historical site/other site” with 4%.  

The “C. Logistics” criterion has a total of 25%, where each sub-criterion has 5%. The 

“D. Perceptiveness” criterion has a total of 5%, with its sub-criterion having 2,5% each.  

The final score of the site is the result of the sum of the points given to each item 

multiplied by the weight of each sub-criterion.  



62 

 

The other type of numerical quantification (the percentage method) is based on the 

score of the site, divided for 170 points or 180 points (depending if the site has or not 

boat and/or canoe access) and multiplied by 100.  

After these calculations, it is necessary to have guidelines to express the results, 

meaning if a geosite, gold historical site and other site is good, medium or bad regarding 

of touristic potential.  

For this, different categories are considered (Table 3.2.) where: 

0%-49% or 0-4.8 points (in red color) means “Insufficient” in terms of touristic 

potential, reflecting that the site is not good enough and it is not so well prepared to 

receive tourists (e.g.: restaurants, toilets, parking area is very far, no interpretative 

material about the site);  

49.5%-69% or 4.9-5.9 points (in orange color) means “Sufficient”, the site 

already has something which meets the needs of the tourists but still is not enough;  

69.5%-79 % or 6-7.9 points (in yellow color) means “Good”, the site is well 

prepared to receive tourists;  

79.5%-89% or 8-8.9 points (in dark green color) means “V?ry Good”, the site is 

very well prepared to receive tourists (e.g.: restaurants, toilets, parking area near);  

89.5%-100% or 9-10 points (in light green color) means “Excellent”, the site is 

already very well prepared with tourism and has everything what is needed to receive 

tourists. 

 

Table 3.2. Considering the final results, the touristic value can b? ??v???? ?n f?v? cat??or??s: “Insuff?c??nt”, 

“Suff?c??nt”, “Goo?”, “V?ry Goo?” an? “Exc?ll?nt”.

3.1.2. Degradation Risk 

 Also the degradation risk was taken into consideration in this work to help to 

have a clearer idea of the sites with higher and lower risk of degradation. The 

degradation risk here will be related with the probability of the geological and historical 

features being damaged or destroyed due to human activity and due to natural processes. 

This procedure is important for a clearer and better management, where the degradation 

risk shows sites with low degradation risk and high touristic potential should be 

promoted being in this way in tourism plans like for example new routes, interpretative 

information, among others; on the other hand, sites with high degradation risk, even if 

they have high touristic potential, should be promoted only after being created 

conditions for protection and conservation (Brilha, 2005).    

 In the degradation risk the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites will have 

the same criteria, sub-criteria and scores. The proposal chosen here was from Brilha 

(2016) with some adaptations to better represent the reality of the area of the Golden 

Geopark of Lapland. It was used five main criteria: “A. Legal Protection”; “B. 

Proximity to areas/activities with potential to cause degradation”; “C. Deterioration of 

the geological/historical elements”; “D. Prox?m?ty w?t? v?lla??s, cities and touristic 

plac?s”; “E. Accessibility” with the sub-criteria: “E.1. Terrestrial accessibility” and 

“E.2; Accessibility by boat and/or canoe”. In terms of scores it was used a score from 0 

to 10, where 0 is the minimum and 10 the maximum points, for each criteria and sub-

criteria making the total of 150 or 160 points (depending if a site has or not the boat 

and/or canoe access). On the criterion “B. Proximity to areas/activities with potential to 

cause degradation” ?a? to b? a???? t?? ?t?m “small scal? ???ra??n? ar?a/act?v?ty 

(?xampl?: ?ol? ?????n?)” b?caus? ?ol? ?????n? can´t be compared with other big 

industrial mining activities. In gold digging the use of machines is extremely rare and 

there is an huge environmental control on this activity being a very green type of gold 

digging (only water from the rivers is used not being aloud any kind of chemicals, when 

finishing the activity it is a rule to leave the landscape clean and in its original state –try 

to put it equal of what it was before the digging activity-, among other many rules 

which help to protect the environment, not forgetting to mention that the gold digging is 

only possible during summer time). The big industrial mining activities are outside of 

the geopark area and the urban areas are quite small populated being mostly small 

villages and quite far from each other, there are no railways and there is only a main 



64 

 

road (highway E75) which runs close to the east edge of the area of the geopark and 

other small roads link to the main road, making in this way the area of the geopark in 

wilderness. On t?? cr?t?r?on “C. D?t?r?orat?on of ??olo??cal/?ol? ??stor?cal ?l?m?nts” ?t 

was a???? t?? “small poss?b?l?ty” an? “t?? poss?b?l?ty of deterioration” since some sites 

are more suitable to deteriorate than others. On the criterion “D. Prox?m?ty w?t? 

villages, cities and touristic places” t?? numb?r of p?opl? l?v?n? ?n a plac? ?a? to b? 

adapted from the original since the population living in Lapland is few with some sparse 

villages and cities. T?? last cr?t?r?on “E. Acc?ss?b?l?ty” was ??v???? ?n two sub-criteria 

as some sites are easier to reach by water than terrestrial access or the only way to visit 

them is via a boat and/or canoe or by land. Other minor changes were made from Brilha 

(2016) proposal, as presented in the table 3.3.

Geosite/gold historical site/other site located less than 100 metres from a boat 

and/or canoe place. 
10 

Geosite/gold historical site/other site located between 100-500 metres from a boat 

and/or canoe place. 
7 

Geosite/gold historical site/other site located between 500 metres and 1 km from a 

boat and/or canoe place. 
5 

Geosite/gold historical site/other site located more than 1 km from a boat and/or 

canoe place.

The quantification of each geosite, gold historical site and other site was based 

on two numerical methodologies: points and percentage, like it happened in the touristic 

value assessment of the sites. The use of two numerical methodologies is important to 

compare the similarity (or not) of the results. The points methodology considers a 



67 

 

weight of 20% to the criterion “A. Legal Protection”; a weight of 20% to the criterion 

“B. Proximity to areas/activities with potential to cause degradation”; a weight of 35% 

to the criterion “C. Deterioration of the geological/historical elements”; a weight of 10%  

to the criterion “D. Prox?m?ty w?t? v?lla??s, cities an? tour?st?c plac?s”; and finally, a 

weight of 15% to the criterion “E. Accessibility”. The last criterion was divided in two 

sub-criteria “E.1. Terrestrial accessibility” and “E.2. Accessibility by boat and/or 

canoe”, where each one have a weight of 7.5%. If there is no boat and/or canoe access 

the sub-criterion E.1. will have a weight of 15%.  

The final score of the site is the result of the sum of the points given to each item 

multiplied by the weight of each sub-criterion. The other type of numerical 

quantification (the percentage) uses the sum of each score, divide for 150 points or 160 

points (depending if the site has or not boat and/or canoe access) and multiply by 100.  

After these calculations, it is necessary to have guidelines to express the results, 

meaning if a geosite, gold historical site and other site is low, medium or high regarding 

of degradation risk.  

For this, different categories are considered (Table 3.4.) where: 

100%-49.5% or 10-4.9 points (in red color) ?n??cat?s t?? s?t? ?s ?n “H??? 

Dan??r” meaning is the worst scenario for a site and rules of protection and 

conservation are a must before promoting the site to the public;  

49%- 36.5% or 4.8-3.9 points (in orange color) the site is in “Danger” meaning 

rules of protection and conservation are still necessary and the site here should be the 

next ones to take care of after the sites in “H??? Dan??r”;  

36%-24.5% or 3.8-2.9 points (in yellow color) t?? s?t? ?as “Mo??rat? Danger” 

meaning the site has not so high but also not so low degradation risk;  

24%-12.5% or 2.8-1.9 points  (in dark green) the site has “Very Small Danger” 

meaning there is no emergency actions because it is in a good condition and can be 

promoted;  

12%-0% or 1.8-0 points (in light green) the sit? ?as “Any Danger” meaning the 

site is not deteriorated, and is safe to promote to the public.

3.2. Results  

 The assessment of the touristic value and the degradation risk of all geosites, 

gold historical sites and other sites (57 in total) are expressed in the tables 3.5 to 3.10. 

To perform this assessment various field trips were made in the field, with some made 

in the month of October of 2015 but mostly of them in May, June and July of 2016. 

Some sites were checked in winter time (December) to confirm if they were open or not 

because of the winter season. The field work form and record performed to each site is 

presented in the Annexe I. The distances between the sites and other places were made 

with the help of the website http://www.retkikartta.fi. For the assessment of the 

degradation risk the website http://gtkdata.gtk.fi/kaivosrekisteri/ was used to see where 

the gold panning places were and to measure the distances between the gold panning 

sites and the sites.

3.3. Discussion 

3.3.1. Touristic Value Assessment 

 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Geosites 

A) Percentage Methodology 

 Starting from the table of the touristic value assessment of the geosites (Table 

3.5.) is possible to see that none of the geosites in the percentage methodology reached 

t?? “Exc?ll?nt” or “V?ry Goo?” cat??or??s b??n? only t?r?? ??os?t?s ?nside of the 

“Goo?” cat??ory, from t?? ?????st to t?? low?st, 79.41% ??os?t? nº 17. Karhunpesäkivi; 

78.52% geosite nº 9. The Rumakuru gorge and 77.35% geosite nº 14. Melt water 

erosional forms on Tankavaara fell. In t?? “Suff?c??nt” cat??ory there are fifteen 

geosites, geosites number 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 being 

the highest one with 68.82% (10. The quartz vein at Hangasoja) and the lowest one with 

49.72% (1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops). Inside of the “Insuff?c??nt” 

category are the geosites number 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 and 24, being the highest one with 

48.88% (24. Lateral drainage channels on the top of the Jäkäläpää fell), almost inside of  

t?? “Suff?c??nt” cat??ory, and the lowest one with 40.83% (5. The Ainikkaharju esker).  

 

B) Points Methodology 

In the points methodology the geosites have better results than in the percentage 

methodology. In this way, none of the geosites r?ac??? t?? “Exc?ll?nt”, start?n? w?t? a 

??os?t? w?t? “V?ry Goo?” (non? of t?? ??os?t?s was ?n t??s cat??ory in the percentage 

methodology) with 8.12 points, geosite nº 9. The Rumakuru gorge; eight geosites in 

“Goo?” cat??ory, ??os?t?s number 7, 8, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 21 (more than in the 

percentage methodology) being the highest one with 7.79 points (14. Melt water 

erosional forms on Tankavaara fell) and the lowest one with 6.43 points (20.The 

Sotkajärvi ?sk?r an? kam?s). In t?? “Suff?c??nt” cat??ory t??r? ar? eight in total (less 

than in percentage methodology) geosites number 2, 3, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22 and 23, being 

the highest one with 5.97 points (22. A cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream) 

and the lowest one with 4.97 points (3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids). The 

geosites which received less points, “Insuff?c??nt”, are seven (one more than in the 

percentage methodology), they are the geosites number 1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13 and 24, being 



85 

 

the highest one with 4.82 points (13. Lateral drainage channels at Teräväkivenpää) and 

the lowest one with 3.97 points (5. The Ainikkaharju esker).  

After comparing and analysing the results from both methodologies, is possible 

to conclude that in the percentage methodology and in the points methodology the 

results didn´t change so much, having the points methodology slightly better results but 

without remarkable differences. 

 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Gold Historical Sites 

A) Percentage Methodology 

Related with the gold historical sites in the percentage methodology, none of the 

sites reached the category “Exc?ll?nt”, b??n? ?n t?? “V?ry Goo?” cat??ory gold 

historical site number 17. Prospector´s mine shaft with 80%; four inside of t?? “Goo?” 

category, sites number 12, 13, 15 and 16, being the highest one with 76.17% (13. The 

Laanila white quartz rock and shaft) and the lowest one w?t? 71.47% (15. G?n?ral’s 

m?n? s?aft); s?v?nt??n ?n t?? “Suff?c??nt” cat??ory, ?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?s number 1, 3, 4, 

5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24, being the highest one with 69.41% 

(14.The Kuivakuru panning facility), almost ?n “Goo?” cat??ory, and the lowest one 

with 49.72% (24. Kar?u Kor?on?n’s Library); there are only three inside of the 

“Insuff?c??nt” category, from the highest to the lowest, gold historical site number 25. 

Korhonen with 43.05%; 2. Ruikanmutka with 41.94%; and finally 23. Pihlajamäki with 

41.38%.  

 

B) Points Methodology 

When speaking of points methodology none of the gold historical sites reached 

t?? “Exc?ll?nt” but two r?ac??? t?? “V?ry Goo?” (on? mor? t?an ?n the percentage 

methodology) being the highest one w?t? 8.39 po?nts (17. Prosp?ctor’s m?n? s?aft) an? 

the lowest one with 8 points (13.The Laanila white quartz rock and shaft); in the 

“Goo?” cat??ory there are eight gold historical sites 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 22  

(more than in the percentage methodology) being the highest one with 7.92 points (16. 

Carl Gustaf mine shaft) and the lowest one with 6.03 points (11. Kultala -Gold Village 

along Pahaoja Brook); ?n t?? “Suff?c??nt” cat??ory t??r? ar? s?v?n s?t?s (l?ss 10 t?an ?n 



86 

 

the percentage methodology) they are gold historical sites number 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 21 

being the highest 4. Kultala Crown Station with 5.92 points and the lowest 9.Palsinoja 

(Raahe cabin) with 4.97 points.  In the “Insuff?c??nt” cat??ory t??r? ar? a total of eight 

gold historical sites while in the percentage methodology were only three, they are sites 

number 2, 5, 6, 10, 18, 23, 24 and 25 being the highest one with 4.85 points (18. The old 

cabin at Suomunruoktu) and the lowest one with 3.43 points (2. Ruikanmutka).  

After comparing and analyzing the results from both methodologies, at this time 

for the gold historical sites, is possible to see that more sites entered in the 

“Insuff?c??nt” cat??ory in the points methodology than in percentage methodology but 

still the points methodology showed slightly better results for the rest of the sites. 

 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Other Sites 

A) Percentage Methodology 

The percentage methodology showed here that none of the sites reached the 

“Exc?ll?nt” category starting in this way with a site inside of “V?ry Goo?”, site n.º 

8.G?olo??cal tra?l w?t? 86.47%;  t?r?? ?n “Goo?” cat??ory, s?t?s number 3, 4 and 1, with 

the highest points 72.22% (3.The Pitfalls at the Sotkajärvi Ridge Chain) and the lowest 

points 70.55% (1. The korkia-Maura Ice Cave); four sites in “Suff?c??nt”, sites number 

2, 5, 6 and 7, being the highest one with 68.88% (5.The Grounds of Kaapin Jouni) and 

the lowest one with 61.17% (2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site), none of the sites 

being ins??? of t?? “Insuff?c??nt” cat??ory.  

 

B) Points Methodology 

Also here non? of t?? s?t?s r?ac??? t?? “Exc?ll?nt” start?n? with one site in the 

“V?ry Goo?” category, site n.º 8.Geological trail with 8.67 points, this site is in the 

same category as ?n t?? p?rc?nta?? m?t?o?olo?y; s?x on t?? “Goo?” cat??ory, s?t?s 

number 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 being the highest one with 7.27 points (5.The Grounds of 

Kaapin Jouni) and the lowest one with 6.46 points (4. Ruijanpolku); there is only one in 

the “Suff?c??nt” category, 2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site with 5.62 points; and 

none inside of the “Insuff?c??nt”.  



87 

 

Here the results from the points methodology were in general better than in the 

percentage methodology.  

To conclude the results from both methodologies, it is possible to say that the 

geosites, gold historical sites and other sites in the points methodology showed in 

general better results than in the percentage methodology, only in the “Insuff?c??nt” 

category the points assessment had more than in the percentage methodology.  

 

3.3.2. Degradation Risk  

In the degradation risk was used both methodologies too, percentage and points, 

for the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites, the only difference between the 

touristic value assessment and the degradation risk assessment is that in the touristic 

value assessment when higher the results better the site in terms of touristic potential, in 

the degradation risk is exactly the contrary, when lower the results better the site, 

meaning that it can be promoted to the public but if there is an high value the site has to 

be taking care of instead of being promoted to the public. 

 

Degradation Risk of the Geosites 

A) Percentage Methodology 

Here is possible to observe that none of the geosites was ?ns??? of “H??? 

Dan??r” category, only one ?n t?? “Dan??r” category with 45% (18. Hummocky 

moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs); s?v?n ?ns??? of “Mo??rat? Dan??r”, ??os?t?s number 

1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 17 and 19, being the lowest one  4.The Saarnaköngäs rapids with 28.33% 

and the highest one 10.The quartz vein at Hangasoja with 36%; thirt??n ?ns??? of “V?ry 

Small Dan??r” category, geosites number 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24, 

being the lowest one 5.The Ainikkaharju esker, 6. The Puoliväli spring and 22. A 

cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream all with 13.33% and the highest one 9. 

The Rumakuru gorge w?t? 24% an? t?r?? ?n “Any Dan??r” cat??ory, 12. The 

Kopsusjärvi delta; 15. Tor formations at Pyhä-Nattanen and 16. Block field covering the 

Nattaset fells all with 12%. 

 

B) Points Methodology 



88 

 

 In the points methodology the geosites didn´t reach the “High Dan??r” or 

“Dan??r” cat??or??s; start?n? w?t? t?r?? ?n “Mo??rat? Dan??r” b??n? t?? low?st ones 

with 3 points (17. Karhunpesakivi and 19. The Rahajärvi collapsed cliff) and the highest 

one with 3.75 points (18.Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs); four ?n “V?ry 

Small Dan??r”, geosites number 1, 2, 3 and 4, being the lowest 4. The Saarnaköngäs 

rapids with 2.02 points and the highest ones 1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops 

and 2. Potholes at Ivalojoen Kultala both with 2.22 points and finally sixteen w?t? “Any 

Dan??r”, geosites number 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24, 

being the lowest 12.The Kopsusjärvi delta, 15.Tor formations at Pyhä-Nattanen and 16. 

Block field covering the Nattaset fells all with 1.15 points and the highest 9. The 

Rumakuru gorge and 23. Talus deposit on the shore of Morgamjärvi lake both with 1.85 

points.  

After comparing and analyzing the results, the points methodology showed 

better results than in the percentage methodology, having sixteen geosites in the 

cat??ory “Any Dan??r” an? non? ?n “Dan??r” or “H??? Dan??r” while in the 

percentage methodology was only three in “Any Dan??r” category and one in “Dan??r” 

category. 

 

Degradation Risk of the Gold Historical Sites 

A) Percentage methodology 

 In the percentage methodology five gold historical sites were inside of  the 

“H??? Dan??r”category, gold historical sites number 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16,  being the 

lowest  12. The Kerkelä mining village; 13. The Laanila white quartz rock and shaft; 14. 

T?? Ku?vakuru pann?n? fac?l?ty an? 15. G?n?ral’s m?n? s?aft all w?t? 54% an? t?? 

highest 16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft with 62%. In t?? “Dan??r” cat??ory t??r? ar? four, 

sites number 1, 2, 3 and 5, being the lowest one 5. The River Bank of the Sotajoki 

Conflu?nc? w?t? 41.66% an? t?? ?????st t?? 1.Gol? Prosp?ctors’ Huts at t?? Mout? of 

Kyläjoki and 3. The Lappi Farm at the Mouth of the Appisjoki both with 46.66%; nine 

?n “Mo??rat? Dan??r” cat??ory, s?t?s number 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 18, 20 and 22 being the 

low?st 18. T?? ol? cab?n at Suomunruoktu w?t? 26% an? t?? ?????st 17. Prosp?ctor’s 

m?n? s?aft w?t? 34%; ?n t?? “V?ry Small Dan??r” there is seven being the lowest ones 

(six) 9. Palsinoja (Raahe cabin); 11. Kultala (Gold Village) along Pahaoja Brook; 21. 



89 

 

T?? s?t? w??r? ?ol? was f?rst foun?; 23. P??la?amäk?; 24. Kar?u Kor?on?n’s L?brary an? 

25. Korhonen all with 15% and the highest 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak with 21%, 

non? of t??m r?ac??? t?? “Any Dan??r” category.  

 

B) Points Methodology 

In the points methodology there are ????t ?ol? ??stor?cal s?t?s ?n “H??? Dan??r” 

(more three than in the percentage methodology) sites number 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 

16 being the lowest 2. Ruikanmutka with 5.52 points and the highest one 16. Carl 

Gustaf mine shaft with 6.8 po?nts; ?n t?? “Dan??r” t??r? ar? two being the lowest one 

22. Morgamoja Kultala with 4 points and the highest 5. The River Bank of the Sotajoki 

Conflu?nc? w?t? 4.82 po?nts; on? ?n t?? “Mo??rat? Dan??r” 18. T?? ol? cab?n at 

Suomunruoktu w?t? 3.6 po?nts; s?v?n ?n “V?ry Small Dan??r”, s?t?s number 4, 6, 7, 8, 

10, 17 and 20, being the lowest 6. The Liljeqvist Dredge and its Surroundings and 10. 

Nulkkamukka - the Birth Place of the Gold Rush both with 2.02 points and the highest 

17. Prosp?ctor’s m?n? s?aft w?t? 2.85 po?nts, f?nally s?v?n ?n “Any Dan??r” s?t?s 

number 9, 11, 19, 21, 23, 24 and 25 being the lowest (six) all with 1.55 points 9. 

Palsinoja (Raahe cabin); 11. Kultala (Gold Village) along Pahaoja Brook; 21. The site 

w??r? ?ol? was f?rst foun?; 23. P??la?amäk?; 24. Kar?u Kor?on?n’s L?brary and 25. 

Korhonen and the highest 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak with 1.8 points. 

After analyzing and comparing the results from both methodologies, it is 

possible to see that many gold historical sites had better points than percentage, for 

example in the points methodology s?v?n r?ac??? t?? “Any Dan??r” cat??ory w??l? ?n 

t?? p?rc?nta?? m?t?o?olo?y non? r?ac??? t??s cat??ory b??n? t?? b?st “V?ry Small 

Dan??r” but w??n ?t ?s t?? “H??? Dan??r” cat??ory mor? s?t?s from t?? po?nts 

methodology are inside of this category (8 in total) while there is only five in the 

percentage methodology. 

 

Degradation Risk of the Other Sites 

A) Percentage Methodology 

 Here there is no site in “H??? Dan??r” category, starting in this way with one 

s?t? ?n “Dan??r” 1. T?? korkia-Maura Ic? Cav? w?t? 46.66%; t?r?? ?n “Mo?erate 



90 

 

Dan??r”, s?t?s number 3, 7 and 8, being the lowest 3. The Pitfalls at the Sotkajärvi 

R???? C?a?n w?t? 26.66% an? t?? ?????st 7.Ukonsaar? Islan? w?t? 35%; t?r?? ?n “V?ry 

Small Dan??r” s?t?s 2, 5 and 6, being the lowest 6. Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church with 

15.83% and the highest 5.The Grounds of Kaapin Jouni with 20% and only one reached 

t?? “Any Dan??r” t?? 4. Ru??anpolku w?t? 12%. 

 

B) Points Methodology 

  In terms of points methodology, on? s?t? ?a? “H??? Dan??r” 1.T?? kork?a-

Maura Ic? Cav? w?t? 5.02 po?nts; non? ?a? “Dan??r” or “Mo??rat? Dan??r”, ?av?n? 

two “V?ry Small Dan??r” 8. G?olo??cal Tra?l w?t? 2.2 po?nts an? 7.Ukonsaar? Island 

with 2.57 points and five “Any Dan??r” b??n? t?? low?st 5. T?? Groun?s of Kaap?n 

Jouni with 1.02 points and the highest one with 1.82 points 3. The Pitfalls at the 

Sotkajärvi Ridge Chain. 

The results from both methodologies (percentage and points) shows the results 

from the points methodology for the other sites were in general better than in the 

percentage methodology.  

 It is possible to see the same thing happened in the degradation risk assessment, 

like in the touristic value assessment, in the points methodology the results were better 

but also this methodology had more sites in “H??? Dan??r” t?an in the percentage 

methodology. Only the geosites didn´t had any site ?n “H??? Dan??r” in both 

methodologies, this can´t be said for the gold historical sites that in the percentage 

methodology were only five and in the other methodology were eight, and in the other 

sites none was inside of the “H??? Dan??r” ?n the percentage methodology but in the 

points methodology there was one site.

 It is important to mention that these charts should be only a guideline to the 

touristic value and the degradation risk since it was taken into consideration only these 

two indicators, further work can be developed to do also the scientific value assessment 

and other methodology, additional to this one, to analyse these three indicators together 

(touristic value, scientific value and degradation risk). A good option could be the final 

ranking developed by Pereira (2006) who created a ranking obtained due to the sum of 

the positions of each indicator (the touristic value, the scientific value and the 

degradation risk) being the final value better ranked when lower is the value of this 

sum. Below there is a simple example of the final ranking made for the other sites only 

for the percentage methodology and only with the touristic value and degradation risk. 

If in the final ranking there are two sites with the same value, one thing that could make 

the difference is the degradation risk, in this way the one which had less degradation 

risk stays higher in the ranking than the one with higher degradation risk. As a result of 

the simulation, the final ranking has the site number 4. Ruijanpolku as first place instead 

of the 8. Geological trail.

Besides the tables developed, it was important to create column charts to 

compare the average of the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites for the touristic 

value and for the degradation risk (first two charts below have colors – blue and gray- 

which were selected randomly) and to see in general the average of all 57 sites for the 

touristic value and degradation risk (last two charts have the colors of the categories for 

the touristic value assessment and degradation risk). 

 In this way the first column charts show that in the touristic value assessment, 

from the percentage and points methodologies, the other sites had higher percentage 

average, with 70.33%, than the geosites and gold historical sites, making it inside of the 

“Goo?” cat??ory as w?ll as ?ts 7.07 points. In the percentage methodology, the average 

of the gold historical sites was 59.64% and the geosites was a little bit less, with 

58.34%, but in the points methodology the geosites has higher points, 5.86 points than 

the gold historical sites with only 5.79 points. Both methodologies makes the average of 

the geosites and gold historical sites inside of the category of “Suff?c??nt”.  



97 

 

In the degradation risk when comparing separately the average of the 24 

geosites, 25 gold historical sites and 8 other sites, it shows that the gold historical sites 

had the highest degradation risk average in both methodologies, with 33.29% and 3.51 

points being both in the cat??ory of “Mo??rat? Dan??r”.  Also in the category of 

“Mo??rat? Dan??r” the other sites are with 25.01%, while the geosites are in the 

cat??ory of “V?ry Small Dan??r” w?t? 22.42%. In the points methodology the geosites 

had 1.87 points making it in “Any Dan??r” category and the other sites received 2.07 

po?nts ?av?n? “V?ry Small Dan??r”.

When the results are analyzed as a total is possible to observe that the average 

for the touristic value of the 57 sites in the percentage methodology is 62.77% and in 

the points methodology is 6.24, making the percentage result ?ns??? of t?? “Suff?c??nt” 

category (orange color) and the points inside of t?? “Goo?” cat??ory (yellow color). 

Related with the degradation risk average, in the percentage methodology is 26.90%

4. Geotourism promotion 
 

When thinking about Finnish Lapland and the Golden Geopark area, tourists are 

attracted by the wilderness and by the very different environment being the nature 

tourism a key of development for Lapland since the beginning of the 1980s 

(Pashkevich, 2014). In summer time tourists (mostly from Finland) are interested in 

explore the wilderness doing hiking, camping, canoeing and gold panning; in autumn 

time is mostly the autumn colors that gives to the landscape colors like red and yellow 

(majority are Finnish hikers); in winter and spring time the snowy environment and 

northern lights are sold with activities like snowmobiling, skiing, snowshoeing, reindeer 

and husky safaris and the famous Santa Klaus, attracting mostly foreigners (Pashkevich, 

2014).  

In terms of  the area of the geopark and related with geotourism, it is possible to 

see some trails –being or not geosites - with some information board with geological 

explanation like for example in Tankavaara Geological trail, Lemmenjoki trails and in 

some of Saariselkä trails (Figure 4.1.). Besides the geological trail of Tankavaara, the 

International Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara has a temporary exhibition with 

the explanation of how gold came to our Planet and to Finland and has a mineral 

exhibition.

exhibition in the International Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara with the explanation of the origins of gold (e). 

 

Related with published materials already developed about geological 

interpretation and/ or geotourism in the area of the geopark, the first steps took place 

with two geological outdoor maps with guide books. The first map was created in the 

year 2000 and covers the western part of Urho Kekkonen National Park and Ivalojoki 

ar?a “Kultakaira Ivalojoki-Saariselkä Geological Outdoor Map 1: 50 000” (Figure 4.2. 

(a)) and the second was developed two years later from the area of Lemmenjoki 

National Park (Figure 4.2.(a)), on these maps is showed rock types and glacial and 

postglacial formations (Johansson et al., 2015) as well as gold historical sites, some 

touristic infrastructures like campfires, parking places, information boards, marked 

trails, accommodation, among others. The guidebook explains geology, gold history 

among other important characteristics of each place. Other publication was taken in 

2014 w??n a ?u???book “Bar?nts Tour for G?otour?sts” ?n English, Norwegian, Finnish 

and Russia languages was created to explore nature, landscape history and geological 

sights comprising northern Norway and Finland and north-western Russia, where it is 

described 26 places in those countries with a circular route– 14 in Finland, 4 in Norway 

(e) 



102 

 

and 8 in Russia with the main goals to preserve the nature (biotic and abiotic) and make 

people aware of the nature and its features (Figure 4.2. (b)). Other materials are 

published by the Geological Survey of Finland for the general public.  

 

   
Figure 4.2. Geological guide books and maps (a) and a guidebook comprising northern Norway and Finland and 
north –western Russia (b).  

 

Besides the information boards and published materials, also in some guiding 

tours like for example in Tankavaara when visitors pan for gold, they receive geological 

information from a geologist. During the gold panning activity it is compared the 

weight of gold with other materials (Figure 4.3. (a)); an explanation of gemstones that 

visitors can find in their pan (Figure 4.3. (b)) and comparison between different types of 

gold from Finland and other countries (Figure 4.3. (c)).

In this way it is possible to see inside of the area of the geopark are already some 

actions made to interpret the geology and develop the geotourism, the creation of the 

geopark will improve the information and services. 

 

4.1. Priority actions in the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites 
 

 As the Golden Geopark of Lapland is still a project – at its beginning stage - 

some of the cr?t?r?a ???n’t ?a? so ?oo? r?sults, this is the reason the work developed 

below analyzes every single criteria (from the tables 3.5 to 3.10) and see which are the 

criteria that could be improved through the creation of some solutions for the geosites, 

gold historical sites and other sites. In this way this will increase the touristic value and 

minimize the degradation risk.  

(c) 



104 

 

4.1.1. Touristic Value Assessment  
 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Geosites 

In all four criteria the ones which had better average was D. Perceptiveness with 

7.37 points, next A. Availability with 6.36 points; B. Use with 6.12 points and finally C. 

Logistics with 4.15 points. When the four main criteria have different weights is 

possible to observe the A. Availability had 3.76 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.66 points 

in 1 point; C Logistics 1.02 in 2.5 points and finally in the criterion D. Perceptiveness 

0.36 points in 0.5 points.  

 

A. Availability (60%):  

A.1. Seasonal Occupancy (20%):  

 More than half of the geosites (sixteen) had 5 points due to the fact they open 

only two seasons, the rest of them – 8 geosites – open all year round. So none of the 

geosites had the minimum points 2.5 (open one season) and none had 7.5 points (open 

three seasons). This happens because many sites are quite danger to visit in winter time 

and also some of them are quite expensive to maintain open in this season, only very 

few which are closed in winter could be changed and be open all year round.  This sub- 

criterion received as an average of 6.6 points or 1.32 points in a maximum of 2 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.1.: 

? 17. Karhunpesäkivi: open all year round instead of two seasons, making the 

cleaning of the snow from the stairs which lead to the cave and the cave itself, 

having 10 points instead of 5 points. 

? 19. Rahajärvi collapsed cliff: open all year round and clean the road and 

parking place, having 10 points instead of 5 points.  

 

These two sites could be open all year round, in this way the average would not 

change so much but it could get 7.08 points or 1.41 points in a maximum of 2 points. 

 

A.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) 

This sub-criterion had a considerable number of geosites (8 geosites) located 

more than 4 kilometres from a paved road or a forest vehicle road  (3 points) due to the 

fact that many are integrated in hiking trails. Three geosites had 1 point, 3. The 



105 

 

Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids, 4. The Saarnaköngäs rapids and 22. A cascade at 

the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream because it is very difficult to visit them, the only 

way is to cross the river and there is no bridges, the only safer way to go is by boat or 

canoe; the geosite nº 7. The Kulmakuru gorge had only 2 points because in summer 

time the trail is shorter (a little bit more than one kilometre) than the one in winter time 

(more or less 8 km). Three geosites had 4 points (between 2 and 4 km from a paved 

road or forest vehicle road); four geosites had 5 points (between 1 and 2 km from a 

paved road or forest vehicle road). Only five geosites were about 1 km and less than 1 

km, and none reaching the maximum points, 10 points.  

In general the geosites are quite far forcing a hike, making the average of this 

sub-criterion 4.08, which is not so high, or 0.102 points in 0.25 points.  

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.2.:  

? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: construction of a bridge for 

people to cross the river, if this is possible it will have instead of 1 point, 5 

points;  

? 4. The Saarnaköngäs rapids: construction of a bridge near this geosite, having 

in this way instead of 1 point, 3 points. 

 

Related with the distances, it is quite difficult to change them, the only thing that 

was possible to do was improve the access when this one is no so easy, like it happen 

with the geosite number 3 and 4 above mentioned. The average here also doesn´t 

change so much but it could have 4.33 points or 0.108 points in 0.25. 

 

A.3. Availability according with people´s physical conditions when the activity is 

hiking or walking (2.5%) 

 In this sub-criterion none of the geosites received the lowest points (1 point: 

being very difficult to reach the geosite only for people with excellent physical 

conditions) starting with thirteen geosites with 5 points (moderate difficulty, at least 

good physical condition); four with 7.5 points (geosites are easy to hike or walk not 

requiring huge physical conditions), in the geosite number 3. The Ivalojoki esker at 

Toloskoski rapids is difficult to cross the river and it is not a good idea to do it, the 

hiking is very short and easy. A good quantity of geosites, seven, were very easy even 



106 

 

for children, receiving in this way 10 points. Making the average of this sub-criterion 

6.87 or 0.17 points in 0.25 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub- criterion A.3.:  

Here nothing was changed because it depends mostly of the person´s good 

physical conditions or not, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child 

can manage to do some small distances, and mostly of the paths are in good conditions 

only having in some of them longer distances, rocky places and some with parts 

requiring more physical effort.  

 

A.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) 

 In this sub-criterion there were 10 geosites with boat and/or canoe access and the 

rest of them no boat and/or canoe access at all. The ones which have the option of boat 

and/or canoe, three geosites where situated more than 4 km from a boat and/or canoe 

having in this way the lowest points (1 point); one between 1 and 2 km (5 points); one 

between 500 metres and 1 km (7 points);  one between 50 and 200 metres (9 points) and 

four reaching the maximum points (10 points) which are located less than 50 metres 

from the boat and/ or canoe, making this sub-criterion with a good average of 6.4 or 

0.16 points in 0.25.  

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.:  

 Also here nothing could be done because it is impossible to change the distance 

between a canoe and/or boat place and the geosite. 

 

A.5. Visibility (2.5%) 

The results here were very satisfactory, starting with two geosites  with 5 points, 

meaning the visibility is medium requiring a closer look to see better the geosites; three 

with 7 points where the visibility was good to all geological elements; a big number of 

geosites, sixteen, had an excellent view to all geological elements (9 points) and the 

only geosites with the maximum points (10 points) being the visibility good even with 

snow and darkness were three because they were the only ones even covered with snow 

it was possible to observe them, they are: 7. The Kulmakuru gorge; 9. The Rumakuru 

gorge and 14. Melt water erosional forms on Tankavaara fell. This sub-criterion had 

quite good results being the average 8.54 points or 0.21 in 0.25 points. 



107 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.:  

? 17. Karhunpesäkivi: if it is possible to open this geosite all year round, the 

visibility will be also improved because to access this geosite the entrance has to 

be clean and the cave too, in this way it will have instead of 9 points, 10 points. 

? 22. A cascade at the mouth of Morgam-Viibus stream: as the only way is 

going by canoe or boat to see this geosite and there are trees covering the 

geosite, one possibility is to cut some trees and other vegetation which hides this 

geosite. In this way the geosite instead of 5 points could reach 9 points. 

 

The rest of the geosites don´t need improvements due to the good results on this 

sub-criterion and the ones which are impossible to observe in winter time is  not 

possible to do something because of the high danger on doing it and in some cases the 

impossibility to provide a better visibility in winter time but if the geosites above could 

be improved (geosites number 17 and 22) this sub-criterion could have an average of 

8.75 points or 0.21 of 0.25 points. 

 

A.6. Safety – in case of an accident (15%) 

 As many geosites are in the wilderness, the distances are quite long to reach 

them, the phone coverage many times does not exist and to access an hospital is quite 

difficult because it is far, these were the reasons why this sub-criterion didn´t had so 

good average. This sub-criterion doesn´t mean the geosites are dangerous or safe to 

visit, it means in case of an accident or emergency if it is easy to call the emergency 

number and go to hospital. In this way there are eleven geosites with 1 point meaning 

the sites are without any safety facilities, no mobile phone coverage and more than 50 

km from the nearest hospital; two with 2 points, geosites with no safety facilities, more 

than 50 km from the nearest hospital but with mobile phone coverage; two with 3 

points, geosite with safety facilities but no mobile phone coverage and more than 50 km 

from the nearest hospital; one with 5 points, geosite with safety facilities, mobile phone 

coverage but more than 50 km from the nearest hospital; seven with 7 points, geosite 

whithout any safety facilities but with mobile phone coverage and located less than 50 

km from the nearest hospital and finally the best ranked was geosite number 17. 

Karhunpesäkivi with 9 points having safety facilities, mobile phone coverage and 

located less than 20 km from the nearest hospital. 



108 

 

 This sub-criterion had very low results making it with an average of 3.5 points or 

0.52 in 1.5 points.  

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: 

? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: the creation of a bridge to cross 

the river, in this way it could have instead of 7 points, 8 points. 

? 15. Tor formations at Pyhä-Nattanen: this geosite doesn´t  need a safety 

facility but in its access is necessary because near this geosite there is a block 

field that visitors have to cross to reach the tor formations and when it is raining 

or starts to have ice it is quite slippery making it necessary to create for example 

a wooden boardwalk. In this way it could have instead of 2 points, 5 points.  

? 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: as this is a block field, when it rains 

or there is frost it is quite danger and very slippery, so it could be important to 

create a wooden boardwalk in this geosite, making it instead of 2 points, 5 

points. 

? 19. The Rahajärvi collapsed cliff: some stairs to make easier the access of the 

geosite and a fence to protect people from the falling rocks from the cliff, in this 

way it could have instead of 7 points, 8 points. 

 

Related with the cellphone coverage and the hospitals, nothing can be done. 

Some geosites didn´t had safety facilities but they are not dangerous. In this way with 

the improvements above described the average could rise a little bit, being 3.83 points 

or 0.57 in 1.5 points. 

 

A.7. Safety in the geosite and its access (15%) 

The safety in the geosite and its access had better results than the safety in case 

of an accident (A.6.). This sub-criterion starts with one geosite with 5 points (site with 

moderate danger) geosite number 19. The Rahajärvi collapsed cliff where it is advised 

to have some attention when it comes to be closer to the geosite, some rocks can fall, 

and when there is snow more danger is added. Three geosites with 6 points having 

moderate danger in their access; four with 8 points, means the geosite requires a little 

bit of precaution and the access is safe; nine sites with 9 points, being the access safe 

(requiring a little bit of precaution) and safe geosite. Finally, seven geosites reached the 



109 

 

maximum points (10) being the geosite as well its access safe. This sub-criterion 

reached a high average with 8.58 or 1.28 on 1.5 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: 

? 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids: the creation of a bridge to cross 

the river and a good well-marked trail, in this way it could have instead of 6 

points, 10 points. 

? 5. The Ainikkaharju esker: there is no marked trail to this geosite making it 

difficult to find if a person doesn´t have good orientation skills, so it will be 

important to have a well-marked trail that leads to this geosite, in this way the 

geosite instead of 6 points could have 9 points. 

? 11. The Nälkäaapa mire: there is no marked trail to this geosite making it 

difficult to find if a person doesn´t have good orientation skills, so it will be 

important  to create signs showing in a clear way where the geosite is, in this 

way instead of 6 points, the geosite could have 8 points. 

? 15. Tor formations at Pyhä-Nattanen: this geosite doesn´t  need a safety 

facility but in its access is necessary because near this geosite there is a block 

field that visitors have to cross to reach the tor formations and when it is raining 

or starts to have ice it is quite slippery making it necessary to create for example 

a wooden boardwalk, in this way it could be instead of 9 points, 10 points.  

? 16. Block field covering the Nattaset fells: as this is a block field, when it rains 

or there is frost it is quite danger and very slippery, so it could be important to 

create a wooden boardwalk in this geosite, making it instead of 8 points, 10 

points. 

? 19. The Rahajärvi collapsed cliff:  some stairs to make the access easier and a 

fence to protect people from the falling rocks from the cliff, in this way it could 

have instead of 5 points, 10 points. 

 

Having the geosites above improved the average can reach 8.58 or 1.28 points to 

9.29 points or 1.39 in 1.5 points. 

 

B. Use (10%) 

 

B.1. Signage (2%) 



110 

 

 As the geopark is at the beginning stage, none of the geosites have yet the sign 

say?n? “??os?t?”, some of them which has some kind of sign are not well signed, others 

don´t have signs at all and few have clear signs making this sub-criterion not so good 

ranked. Twelve geosites had 0 points due to the fact that there is no signs in the access 

road to the geosite neither in the geosite, making it quite impossible to locate; two 

geosites with 2.5 points, with sings only in the access roads; two with 5 points, which 

means there is signs only near the geosite or in the geosite; and finally, eight reached the 

7.5 points which means there is signs in the main road which lead to the site and in the 

site showing it as a touristic place or a geological site; none reaching the maximum 

points (10 points: signs showing it is a “geosite”). The lack of signs in access roads to 

the geosites and also in the geosites gave a very low average in this sub-criterion, only 

with 3.12 points or 0.06 in 0.2 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: 

? All the geosites must ?av? t?? s??n say?n? “??os?t?” of the Golden Geopark and 

as there is only a main road in the geopark that links to secondary ones it is 

?mportant to put ?n t?? ma?n roa? (E75) s??ns say?n? “??os?t?” an? ?n t?? roads 

that leads to the geosites. Related with the trails, mostly of them have a board 

information at the starting point of the trail being important to mention the 

geosites on them. 

 

This is a sub-criterion that can have 10 points or 0.2 in 0.2 points, having in this 

way the maximum points. 

 

B.2. The current use of the geosite in terms of geological interest (2%) 

 Fortunately this sub-criterion was good, being all geosites (24 geosites) with 7.5 

points meaning that the geological information is in internet, leaflets, maps, books and 

also in some board information, not having reached the 10 points - an interpretative 

centre for the geosites. In this way it had an average of 7.5 points or 0.15 in 0.2 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.2.: 

? Having a small interpretative centre for example in Tankavaara Visitor Centre or 

in the mineral exhibition from Tankavaara International Gold Museum or other 

partner with a space to do an exhibition, could rise the points from 7.5 or 0.15 to 



111 

 

10 or 0.2 points but of course it is not a must cause the information is already in 

internet, leaflets, books, maps and it is very easy to access. 

 

B.3. The current use of the geosite for other types of interest (2%) 

 In this sub-criterion none of the geosites had the minimum points (0 points) - 

any kind of type of interest, promotion and/or use; starting with four with 1 point, 

geosite with other types of interest but without promotion and/or use; eight geosites 

with 3 points, meaning that the geosite is integrated in a non-circular walking trail and 

ski trail or non-circular trail (walking or ski trail) and non-circular boat/canoe route; five 

geosites with 5 points, geosite integrated in a circular walking trail or sky trail or geosite 

integrated in circular boat/canoe route; four with 7 points, meaning that the geosite has a 

circular walking trail and ski trail or circular trail (walking or ski trail) and circular 

boat/canoe route. None having 9 points, meaning the geosite has other type of interest, 

with promotion but not use; the best points (10) geosite with other type of interest(s), 

promotion and use being here three geosites. This sub-criterion had an average of 4.41 

points or 0.08 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: 

? 5. The Ainikkaharju esker: this geosite is not signed at all, so it could be 

important to create a well-marked trail showing this geosite, having in this way 

instead of 1 point, 3 points. 

? 11. The Nälkäaapa mire: the creation of a small hiking trail to see this geosite, 

in this way it could have instead of 1 point; 3 points. 

?  18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs and 19. The Rahajärvi 

collapsed cliff: the creation of a circular hiking trail to link these geosites and 

the 17. Karhunpesäkivi geosite too, it could be developed two routes - one 

smaller and other bigger - linking those three geosites, having in this way 

instead of 1 points, 5 points. In the future a circular ski trail could be also 

implemented here having in this way 7 points the geosites nº 18 and nº19. 

 

With small improvements this sub-criterion can have 5.12 points or 0.10 in 0.2 

points and if the geosite number 17, 18 and 19 can have a circular hiking trail and ski 

trail the average will rise a little bit more reaching 5.29 points or 0.10 points in 0.2. 

 



112 

 

B.4. Use limitation of the geosite (4%) 

 The sub-crierion of use limitations has a really good score with most of the 

geosites being possible to visit without any restrictions (10 points), only one had 

restrictions like private property (2.5 points: 3. The Ivalojoki esker at Toloskoski rapids) 

and two had physical restrictions (7.5 points: like fences, obstacles). This sub-criterion 

had maximum of 9.47 or 0.37 points in 0.4 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: 

 As this sub-criterion had really good average nothing was changed. The geosites 

with physical restrictions are possible to be visited and even the 3. The Ivalojoki esker 

at Toloskoski rapids has private properties before reaching the geosite is still possible to 

be visited and there is the option of canoe where there is no private properties to cross. 

 

C. Logistics (25%) 

C.1. Cleanliness (5%) 

 Here the results were satisfactory, there weren´t dirty geosites, full of rubbish 

spread all over the place giving a bad look to the site. All the geosites were clean, and 

the ones with less points, seven geosites with 5 points, were clean only without rubbish 

bins; the majority of the geosites, fifteen geosites, had 7.5 points, meaning that the 

geosites were clean without a rubbish bin but they were located less than 5 km from the 

geosite. Only two reached the 10 points, meaning that the geosite had rubbish bins. This 

sub-criterion had an average of 6.97 or 0.34 points in 0.5 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: 

Here nothing needs to be changed, of course to reach the 10 points all the 

geosites must have a rubbish bin but as all the geosites are clean even if they don´t have 

a rubbish bin, it is not so important to improve this sub-criterion.  

 

 

C.2. Toilets (5%) 

Here the results were in the middle (not so good but also not so bad) due to the 

fact that even in the wilderness the trails are prepared with dry toilets for outdoor 

people, so there were sites with the minimum points (1 point) and maximum as well (10 

points), being a big part of the geosites with 2.5 points. In this way two geosites had 1 



113 

 

point meaning that the geosites have toilets more than 5 km; ten with 2.5 points, toilets 

less than 5 km; four geosites with 5 points, toilets less than 1 km from the geosites; four 

geosites with 7.5 points, toilets less than 200 metres from the geosite; four geosites with 

10 points, toilets on the geosite. The average here is 4.87 points or 0.24 points in 0.5 

points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: 

 Even though the average of this sub-criterion was not so high, it is not a must to 

improve it since in the wilderness far from the cities and villages there are always dry 

toilets for people when hiking, canoeing, etc. One thing which could justify the creation 

of more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the number of visitors doing 

outdoor activities increases in a considerable number.  

 

C.3. Restaurants (5%) 

 The sub-criterion here was not good, being the maximum points 5 and only for 

two geosites and the rest under this value. In this way there were seven geosites with 0 

points, meaning there is no restaurants less than 20 km; two geosites with 1 point, being 

the nearest restaurants between 5 km and 20 km but opening seasonally; seven geosites 

with 2 points, being the nearest restaurant between 5 km and 20 km open all year round; 

two geosites with 3 points, having a restaurant between 1 km and 5 km opening 

seasonally; four geosites with 4 points, having a restaurant between 1 km and 5 km 

opening all year round; finally two geosites with 5 points (only a café in the geosite or 

less than 1 km from the geosite and it opens seasonally), the two geosites with 5 points 

are: 17. Karhunpesäkivi and 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs. The sub-

criterion had so few points that makes the average here quite low, having only 2 points 

or 0.1 points in 0.5 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: 

 This was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the 

trails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and of course it 

would be very expensive to create a restaurant in the geosites which are far. Also here 

only when the geopark starts to work and there is a justification for that it could be 

changed something, for example opening a café or restaurant all year round instead of 

shorter time or the construction of a new one. 



114 

 

C.4. Accommodation (5%) 

 In the accommodation the results were not so good but better than in C.3. In this 

way there are seven geosites with the minimum points (1 point), meaning there is a hut 

for hikers in the hiking trail or in the geosite; one geosite with 4 points, many types of 

accommodation less than 20 km and it opens seasonally; twelve geosites with 5 points 

having many types of accommodation less than 20 km; and finally, four geosites with 7 

points having many types of accommodation less than 5 km. Having in total of 4.12 

points or 0.2 points in 0.5 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: 

 Here, like it happened in the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the moment, 

maybe in the future if it justifies. 

 

C.5. Local buses (5%) 

 As the public local buses are quite few and working only couple hours per day, 

this sub-criterion was low ranked having ten geosites with 0 points, geosite more than 

20 km from the bus stop for a local bus; six geosites with 2 points, geosite between 10 

km and 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus; one geosite with 4 points, between 5 

km and 10 km from a bus stop for a local bus; four geosites with 6 points, geosite 

between 1 km and 5 km from a bus stop for a local bus; one with 8 points, geosite less 

than 1 km from the bus stop for a local bus; finally, two reached the maximum points 

(10 points), there is a bus stop in the geosite (less than 300 metres): 17. Karhunpesäkivi 

and 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs. This sub-criterion received an 

average of 2.83 points or 0.14 points in 0.5 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: 

 Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment only in the 

future if it justifies, the other options is to rent a car or go by taxi. 

 

D. Perceptiveness (5%) 

D.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) 

 This sub-criterion was the most subjective (based on the opinion of one viewer) 

and according to the viewer´s point of view the results here were not so satisfactory 

being only a geosite with 10 points and mostly of them with 4 points, fortunately none 



115 

 

of them had 0 points. In this way three geosites had 1 point, being a geosite without any 

kind of beauty; eleven with 4 points, being a pleasant geosite, without any outstanding 

beauty; two with 5 points, pleasant geosite, with some moderately attractive elements 

(small dimension); four geosites with 7 points being a pleasant geosite, with attractive 

elements, with visual impact; three with 8 points being very attractive geosite, with a 

strong visual impact; and only one geosite reached 10 points, being all the elements of 

the geosite extremely attractive, with a huge visual impact: 15. Tor formations at Pyhä-

Nattanen. This sub-criterion had an average of 4.95 points or 0.12 points in 0.25 points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: 

 As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the person´s opinion when is 

looking to the geosite, it can´t be changed and since there is no geosite with negative 

impact (rubbish spread all over the place) this sub-criterion will have the same results as 

before. 

 

D.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) 

 In this one, twenty three geosites had the maximum points, all the geological 

elements are presented in a very clear way and understandable for all types of public, 

only one geosite had 5 points, the visitor need to have some geological background to 

understand the geological element(s) of the geosite: 1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock 

outcrops. This sub-criterion had a successfully 9.79 points average or 0.24 in 0.25 

points. 

 

Priority actions in the geosites to improve the sub-criterion D.2.: 

? 1. The Lihr rock and its bedrock outcrops: was the only geosite 

receiving 5 points instead of 10 points due to the fact that is a little bit 

difficult to understand its features but with a good geological explanation 

it can reach the 10 points easily, making in this way an average of 9.79 or 

0.24 points to 10 points or 0.25 points in this sub-criterion. 

 

 

 

 

 



116 

 

 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Gold Historical Sites 

 In all four criteria the one which had better average was B. Use with 7.12; next 

D. Perceptiveness with 7.1; A. Availability with 6.05 and finally C. Logistics with 4.1 

points. When the four main criteria have different weights is possible to observe the A. 

Availability had 3.67 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.74 points in a total of 1 point; C. 

Logistics 1.01 in 2.5 points and finally in the criterion D. Perceptiveness 0.35 points in 

0.5 points. 

 

A. Availability (60%) 

A.1. Seasonal Occupancy (20%) 

 In the seasonal occupancy the average was the same as in the geosites, being 6.6 

points or 1.32 in 2 points.  In this way seventeen sites were open two seasons (5 points) 

and eight all year round (10 points), none of them being open one season (2.5 points) or 

three (7.5 points).  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.1.: 

? 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: could be open all year round, so 

instead of 5 points it could have 10 points.  

 

It is difficult to know if the ones with 5 points could be open all year round 

because the costs to maintain them and the safety can be factors to keep them closed. If 

this gold historical site above mentioned could be open all year round the points will not 

change so much but this sub-criterion could have 6.8 points or 1.36 points in 2 points. 

 

A.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) 

 In this sub-criterion the results were not satisfactory, with an average of 3.72 or 

0.09 points, being lower than in the geosites. The gold historical sites are between 1 

point and maximum 7 points, none reaching more than this, this happens due to the fact 

that many gold historical sites are in the wilderness having the visitor to walk to see 

them. In this way there is three gold historical sites with 1 point, 2. Ruikanmutka; 7. 

R?takosk?’s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine being the access to 

these sites very difficult only possible with special equipment like for example a boat or 

canoe; twelve gold historical sites with 3 points being the access possible and located 



117 

 

more than 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road; three with 4 points, being the 

historical site located between 2 km and 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road; 

one gold historical site with 5 points, being the site located between 1 km and 2 km 

from a paved road or a forest vehicle road; five sites with 6 points, being the site 

between 500 metres and 1 km from a paved road or a forest vehicle road and finally the 

only site reaching 7 points, located between 200 and 500 metres from a paved road or 

forest vehicle road, site number 16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft. 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.2.: 

? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge because it is very difficult 

and dangerous to cross the river to see this site, having instead of 1 point, 

3 points. 

? 7. Ritakoski’s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine: 

the construction of a bridge near these two sites since the nearest bridge 

to cross the river stays quite far (about 10 km), having both in this way 

instead of 1 point, 2 points each. 

 

The distances to reach the gold historical sites can´t be changed, only the 

number 2, 7 and 8 were changed due to its difficult access. In this way the average 

didn´t increase so much having  3.96 points or 0.099 in 0.25 points. 

 

A.3. Availability according to people´s physical conditions when the activity is hiking 

or walking (2.5%) 

 This sub-criterion didn´t had so much difference from the geosites, being here 

the average of 6.28 points or 0.15 in 0.25 points while in the geosites it was 6.87 or 0.17 

points. This is related with the long distances to reach the gold historical sites, like it 

happened with the geosites. In this way there are two sites with 1 point, being the site 

very difficult to reach only possible for people with excellent physical conditions; 

fifteen with 5 points, being the site with moderate difficulty at least for people with 

good physical conditions; and finally eight sites reached the maximum points (10 

points), being those sites very easy, even for children, in these sites the distances are 

quite short and the paths are in good conditions.  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.3.: 



118 

 

Here nothing was changed because it depends mostly on the person´s physical 

conditions, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child can manage 

some small distances, and mostly of the paths are in good conditions only having in 

some of them (mostly on the shores of Ivalojoki River) some ups and downs, rocky 

parts and very steep areas which requires from the person a good physical preparation 

and good outdoor gear.  

 

A.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) 

 In twenty five gold historical sites, seventeen had the option of boat and/or 

canoe being here the average of 4.6 or 0.16 points in 0.25. There were four sites with 1 

point, being the site more than 4 km from a boat and/or canoe; two with 3 points, site 

between 2 and 4 km from a boat and/or canoe; one with 5 points, site between 1 km and 

2 km from a boat and/or canoe; and finally, ten had 10 points being very close to a boat 

and/or canoe (less than 50 metres).  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.: 

 Also in this sub-criterion nothing could be changed relatively to the distances 

between the gold historical sites and the boat and/or canoe place. 

 

A.5. Visibility (2.5%) 

 In this sub-criterion the average was very good being 9.24 points or 0.23 in 0.25 

points, better than in the geosites. Here, only a site had 5 points having the need to go 

closer to see better all the historical elements and the rest of them with 9 and 10 points. 

The ones which received 9 points are fourteen, the visibility to all historical elements is 

excellent; with 10 points are ten, the visibility of the gold historical site is good to all or 

the most important historical elements even with snow and darkness.  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.: 

? 2. Ruikanmutka: cleaning the vegetation around the buildings, in this 

way could have 9 points instead of 5.  

 

In the rest of the sites nothing was changed since they are good ranked and if 

they are not so perfectly visible in winter time is not a problem at all, in this way the 

average could slightly rise from 9.24 or 0.23 points to 9.4 or 0.23 in 0.25 points.

A.6. Safety - in case of an accident (15%) 

 In the safety in case of an accident the results were very bad, only with 2.96 or 

0.44 in 1.5 points, being even lower than in the geosites. This low results are related 

with the fact that many of the gold historical sites are in the wilderness far from 

hospitals and without cellphone coverage. None of the sites had 0 points (site 

impossible to visit due to the high danger on it); starting with thirteen sites with 1 point 

(site without any safety facilities, no mobile phone coverage and located more than 50 

km from the nearest hospital); one with 2 points (no safety facilities, more than 50 km 

from the nearest hospital but with mobile phone coverage); four with 3 points (with 

safety facilities but more than 50 km from the nearest hospital and no mobile phone 

coverage); one with 5 points (with safety facilities, mobile phone coverage but located 

more than 50 km from the nearest hospital); and finally, six sites reached 7 points (site 

with no safety facilities but with mobile phone coverage and located less than 50 km 

from the nearest hospital).  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: 

? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the 

river, having in this way instead of 1 point, 3 points. 

? 7. Ritakoski’s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine:  

the construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, having in this 

way instead of 1 point, 3 points each site. 

 

The rest of the gold historical sites nothing much could be done since the mobile 

phone coverage and the distances from the nearest hospital are quite difficult to change 

and the gold historical sites which don´t have safety facilities don´t make them 

dangerous, actually mostly of the paths are quite well preserved and taking care of. If 

the gold historical sites above mentioned could be improved, the average could change 

slightly having 3.2 points or 0.48 in 1.5 points. 

 

A.7. Safety in the gold historical site and its access (15%) 

 The results were really good being the average of 8.4 points or 1.26 in 1.5 

points, slightly lower than in the geosites. In this way, only one gold historical site had 2 

points (high danger in the access to the site): 2. Ruikanmutka, very dangerous to cross 

the river; five with 6 points (moderate danger in the access to the site); the rest of the 



120 

 

sites had good points having twelve 9 points (safe access only with a little precaution 

and safe site) and seven 10 points (safe access and site). 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: 

? 2. Ruikanmutka: the construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, 

having in this way instead of 2 points, 9 points. 

? 7. Ritakoski’s Kultala Gold Village and 8. Ritakoski steam engine: the  

construction of a bridge for hikers to cross the river, having in this way instead 

of 9 points, 10 points each.  

? 18. The old cabin at Suomunruoktu: as this cabin is in the wilderness, 

orientation skills are required to find this site, in this way it will be better for the 

safety of the hikers to have a well-marked path, having this gold historical site 

instead of 6 points, 9 points. 

? 23. Pihlajamäki: in the area where this gold historical site is located is quite 

common to have thick fog making quite difficult to see something, so it will be 

important to mark quite well the trail with poles closer to each other showing the 

way. This will make instead of 6 points, 9 points.  

? 24. Karhu Korhonen’s Library: having poles closer to each other to sign the 
path because is quite common fog and bad weather in this area, having in this 

way instead of 6 points, 9 points. 

 

If this actions above mentioned could be practiced the average will rise from 8.4 

points or 1.26 points to 9.12 points or 1.36 points in 1.5 points.  

 

B. Use (10%) 

B.1. Signage (2%) 

 The results here were quite spread, having some sites low points and others high 

points making in this way an average of 4.8 or 0.096 in 0.2 points, more than in the 

geosites. As the gold history in this region is very rich, some of the gold historical sites 

have good signage, the only thing missing in all of them are signs showing that they are 

gold historical sites from the geopark. In this way there are six gold historical sites with 

0 points (no signs in the access road to the site neither in the site); one with 2.5 points 

(signs only in the access road); seven with 5 points (signs only near the site or in the 

place); eleven sites with 7.5 points (signs on the main road access and in the site 



121 

 

showing it is a touristic place, historical site or geological site); and none reaching the 

10 points. 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: 

? All the gold historical sites need signs in the access roads and in the site saying 

is a gold historical site from the Golden Geopark. As there is only a main road 

that links to secondary ones it is important to put in the main road (E75) and in 

the roads that leads to these sites the signs. Related with the trails, mostly of 

them have a board information at their starting point where it is necessary to 

mention the historical sites. In this way the average will be 10 points or 0.2 in 

0.2 points. 

 

B.2. The current use of the gold historical site in terms of historical interest (2%) 

 Until now this was the best sub-criterion from the gold historical sites and from 

the geosites, with all the sites having 10 points, making in this way the average of 10 

points or 0.2 points in 0.2 points due to the fact that all gold historical sites are 

represented in a museum, the International Gold Museum of Tankavaara.  

 

B.3. The current use of the gold historical site for other interests (2%) 

 The results here were not good, with 4.6 or 0.09 points in 0.2 points, a little bit 

lower than in the geosites. Mostly of the sites (nineteen sites) had 3 and 5 points and 

only three reached the 10 points. In this way there is one site with 0 points (site without 

other type of interest, promotion and/ or use); one site with 1 point (site with other types 

of interest but without promotion and/ or use); nine with 3 points (site integrated in a 

non-circular walking trail and ski trail or non-circular trail, walking or ski trail, and non-

circular boat/canoe route); ten sites with 5 points (site integrated in a circular walking 

trail or sky trail or site integrated in circular boat/canoe route); one with 7 points (site 

with a circular walking trail and ski trail or circular trail, walking or ski trail, and 

circular boat/canoe route) and three with 10 points (site with other type of interest(s), 

with promotion and use). 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: 

? 19. The memorial to Sauva-Aslak: on the path that leads to this memorial there 

is some remains of the Lapland War like old bombs, mines, grenades that could 



122 

 

be better preserved and with some structure like showcases in the trail instead of 

being on the floor and getting damage like it happens right now (Figure 4.4.). In 

this way not only gold history will be held but also a little bit of Lapland War 

history, having this sub-criterion instead of 1 point, 10 points.  

 

Related with the other gold historical sites, is not a must to change them since 

they are already integrated for example in hiking trails, ski trails, canoe routes. The 

average can rise  a little bit from 4.6 or 0.092 points to 4.96 or 0.099 points if the site 

above could be improved.  

 

 

Figure 4.4. Bombs, grenades, mines from the Lapland War left on the path. 

 

 

B.4. Use limitations of the gold historical site (4%) 

 In this sub-criterion the average of the sites was very good, having 9.1 points or 

0.36 in 0.4 points, a little bit less than in the geosites. The majority of the sites (twenty 

sites) had 10 points (site without any restrictions); three with 7.5 points (site with 

physical restrictions like fences, obstacles, etc.) and two with 2.5 points (site with 



123 

 

restrictions like opening hours, private property, etc.), none of them having 0 points 

(without any possibility to visit the site).  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: 

 Here nothing needs to be changed since the average is very good and all gold 

historical sites can be visited even if they have restrictions.  

  

C. Logistics (25%) 

C.1. Cleanliness (5%) 

 This sub-criterion has a good average of 7.9 points or 0.39 points in 0.5 points, a 

little bit more than in the geosites. Being none of the gold historical sites with 0 points 

(site without any cleanliness, full of rubbish spread all over the place) and 2.5 points 

(site not so clean but with rubbish bins), being the minimum points 5 for three sites 

(clean site but without rubbish bins); fifteen with 7.5 points (clean site without rubbish 

bins but located less than 5 km from the site) and seven with 10 points (clean site with 

rubbish bins).   

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: 

Like it happened in the geosites, this sub-criterion doesn´t need changes, of 

course to reach the 10 points it could be arrange in every sinlge gold historical site a 

rubbish bin but as all the sites are clean even when they don´t have a rubbish bin, it is 

not a must to change this sub-criterion.  

 

C.2. Toilets (5%) 

 This sub-criterion had not so bad results, having an average of 6.54 points or 

0.32 points in 0.5 points, higher than in the geosites. There is only one site with the 

minimum points (1 point) having the toilets more than 5 km from the site; eight with 2.5 

points, toilets less than 5 km from the site; three with 5 points, toilets less than 1 km 

from the site; one with 7.5 points, toilets less than 200 metres from the site; and twelve 

with 10 points, toilets in the site.  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: 

In this sub-criterion is not a must to improve it since there is always dry toilets in 

mostly of the trails for people when hiking, canoeing, etc. One thing which could justify 



124 

 

the creation of more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the amount of 

visitors doing outdoor activities increases in a considerable number. 

 

C.3. Restaurants (5%) 

 This sub-criterion had very bad average, only reaching 1.28 points or 0.06 in 0.5 

points, worse than in the geosites. As many gold historical sites are in the wilderness the 

restaurants are quite far from the sites, in this way seventeen gold historical sites have 0 

points (there is no restaurants less than 20 km from the site); two with 2 points 

(restaurant between 5 km and 20 km); five with 4 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 

km from the site); one with 8 points (restaurant less than 1 km from the site); and none 

reached the 10 points (restaurant in the site, less than 300 metres). 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: 

 This was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the 

trails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and it would be very 

expensive to create a restaurant in such a remote areas. Also here only when the geopark 

starts to work it could be changed something, for example opening a café or restaurant 

all year round instead of shorter time or a construction of a new one if it justifies. 

 

C.4. Accommodation (5%) 

 Here the results were lower than in the geosites, being the average of the gold 

historical sites for accommodation only 2.8 points or 0.14 points in 0.5, being seventeen 

sites with 1 point (there is a hut for hikers in the hiking trail and/or in the site); three 

with 5 points (many types of accommodation less than 20 km); four with 7 points (many 

types of accommodation less than 5 km) and only one with 10 points (many types of 

accommodation less than 1 km).   

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: 

 Here, like it happened with the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the 

moment, maybe in the future if it justifies. 

 

C.5. Local buses (5%) 

 This sub-criterion had very low average due to the same thing that happened in 

the geosites, few buses working in a very short time and long distances from the sites. 



125 

 

In this way this sub-criterion had 2 points or 0.1 points in 0.5 points, a little bit lower 

than in the geosites. None of the gold historical sites reached the 10 points (bus stop in 

the site, less than 300 metres); seventeen had 0 points (site more than 20 km from a 

local bus stop); one with 2 points (site between 10 km and 20 km from the bus stop for a 

local bus); four with 6 points (site between 1 km and 5 km from a local bus stop); and 

finally, three sites with 8 points (site less than 1 km from the bus stop for a local bus).  

 

Priority actions in the gold historical sites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: 

 Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment, only in the 

future if it justifies, the other options is to rent a car or go by taxi.  

 

D. Perceptiveness (5%) 

D.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) 

 In the aesthetics, the gold historical sites had 4.2 points of average or 0.1 in 0.25 

points, a little bit lower than in the geosites. Here there was no site with 10 points being 

the highest points 7 and the majority of the sites were between 4 and 5 points. In this 

way there is three sites with 1 point (site without any kind of beauty); ten sites with 4 

points (pleasant site, without any outstanding beauty); ten sites with 5 points (pleasant 

gold historical site, with some moderately attractive elements – small dimension); and 

finally two with 7 points (pleasant site, with attractive elements, with visual impact). 

 

Priority actions in the gold historical to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: 

 As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the viewer´s point of view when 

is looking to the gold historical sites, it won´t be changed and since there are no gold 

historical sites with negative impact (rubbish spread all over the place, for example) this 

sub-criterion will have the same average as before. 

 

D.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) 

 As there is a museum (Tankavaara Gold Museum), publications, among other 

materials explaining the gold historical sites, it is easy to general public understands in a 

very clear way all gold historical sites, having in this way the average of 10 points or 

0.25 in 0.25 points. 

 

 



126 

 

Touristic Value Assessment of the Other Sites 

Here the highest sub-criterion was D. Perceptiveness with 8.37 points; after that 

A. Availability with 7.61; B. Use with 7.35 and C. Logistics with 5.54 points. When the 

four main criteria have different weights is possible to observe the A. Availability had 

4.52 points in a total of 6; B. Use 0.71 points in a total of 1 point; C. Logistics 1.36 

points in a total of 2.5 points and finally the criterion D. Perceptiveness 0.41 points in a 

total of 0.5 points.  

 

 

A. Availability (60%) 

A.1. Seasonal occupancy (20%) 

 The average for this sub-criterion was 8.43 points or 1.68 points in 2 points, 

better than in the gold historical sites and the geosites. Being only two sites with 5 

points (open two seasons); one with 7.5 points (open three seasons) and the rest of the 

five with 10 points (open all year round).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.1.: 

? 2. Sallivaara Reindeer Round-Up Site: it could be open all year round, having 

in this way instead of 5 points, 10 points. 

? 4. Ruijanpolku: it could be open all year round, having in this way instead of 5 

points, 10 points. 

 

In this way the average will rise from 8.43 points or 1.68 points to 9.68 or 1.93 

points. 

 

A.2. Terrestrial accessibility (2.5% or 5%) 

 In the terrestrial accessibility the results were not so satisfactory, having an 

average of 4.25 or 0.1 in 0.25 points, not so different from the geosites and the gold 

historical sites. None of the sites had 0 points but the results were quite spread, three 

with 1 point (the access to the site is very difficult, only possible with special 

equipment: boat, canoe, etc.); one with 3 points (the access to the site is possible and it 

is located more than 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road); one with 4 points 

(site located between 2 km and 4 km from a paved road or forest vehicle road); one with 

6 points (site located between 500 metres and 1 km from a paved road or forest vehicle 



127 

 

road); one with 8 points (site located between 50 metres and 200 metres from a paved 

road or forest vehicle road); and one with 10 points (site located less than 50 metres 

from a paved road or forest vehicle road with a parking area for a bus).   

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.2.: 

The accessibility is quite good and the sites which had 1 point have already 

transportation like boats from local enterprises, the rest of the sites the distances can´t 

be changed. 

 

A.3. Availability according with people´s physical conditions when the activity is 

hiking or walking (2.5) 

 Here the average was quite good having 8.12 points or 0.2 in 0.25 points, better 

than in the geosites and the gold historical sites. None of the sites had 1 point (very 

difficult to reach the site, only for people with excellent physical conditions); starting 

with 5 points one site (moderate difficulty, at least good physical conditions); four with 

7.5 points (easy even for people with no great physical conditions) and three with 10 

points (very easy, even for children).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.3.: 

Here nothing was changed because it depends mostly on the person´s good 

physical conditions or not, if he/she is able to walk many kilometres or not or if a child 

can manage some small distances, and the trails are in good conditions and mostly of 

them without big difficulties. 

 

A.4. Boat and/or canoe access (2.5%) 

  Here in eight sites, five had canoe and/or boat access being four with the 

maximum points, 10 points (site located less than 50 metres from a boat and/or canoe) 

and one with 5 points (site located between 1 km and 2 km from a boat and/or canoe) 

having an average of 9 points or 0.22 in 0.25 points, better average than in the geosites 

and gold historical sites.  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.4.: 



128 

 

 Nothing will be changed since this sub-criterion had very good average and also 

it is quite difficult to change the distances between the sites and the boat and/or canoe 

places. 

 

A.5. Visibility (2.5%) 

 In the visibility the average was very good having 9.5 points or 0.23 in 0.25 

points, being similar with the geosites and gold historical sites. Here none of the sites 

had 0 or less than 9 points, being four sites with 9 points (the visibility is excellent to all 

geological/historical elements) and four reached the 10 points (good visibility to all or 

the most important historical/ geological elements even with darkness and snow).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.5.: 

 Since the visibility results were quite satisfactory, changes in this sub-criterion 

were not necessary. 

 

A.6. Safety (15%) 

 The average here was a little bit better than in the geosites and the gold historical 

sites, having an average of 4.37 points or 0.65 in 1.5 points and none of the sites had 0 

points neither reached the 10 points. In this way the sites with less points were two with 

2 points (site with no safety facilities and more than 50 km from the nearest hospital but 

with mobile phone coverage); one with 3 points (site with safety facilities - fences, 

stairs, handrails, etc.- but no mobile phone coverage and located more than 50 km from 

the nearest hospital); four with 5 points (site with safety facilities - fences, stairs, 

handrails, etc. -, mobile phone coverage but located more than 50 km from the nearest 

hospital)  and one with 8 points (site with safety facilities, with mobile phone coverage 

and located less than 50 km from the nearest hospital).   

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.6.: 

 Here nothing needs to be changed even when the sites don´t have safety facilities 

because they are not dangerous. Related with the distances from the hospital and mobile 

phone coverage, these factors are quite difficult to change. 

 

A.7. Safety in the other site and its access (15%) 



129 

 

 In this sub-criterion the results were better than in the geosites and the gold 

historical sites, having an average of 9.62 points or 1.44 in 1.5 points. Here none of the 

sites had 0 points or less than 8, starting from 8 points one site (safe site – only with a 

little precaution- and safe access); one with 9 points (safe access – only with a little 

precaution- and safe site) and six sites with 10 points (site and access without any 

danger for the visitor). 

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion A.7.: 

 Another sub-criterion where nothing needs to be done. The site which received 8 

points, 1. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave, visitors should be careful to not fall in the rocks 

when entering in the cave but is still quite safe, and the site which received 9 points, 4. 

Ruijanpolku, is a safe hiking trail well singed and with some support structures for 

hikers but is always important when hiking to pay attention to the surrounding 

environment. 

 

B. Use (10%) 

B.1. Signage (2%) 

 Here the average was higher than in the geosites and the gold historical sites, 

having in this way 6.87 points or 0.13 in 0.2 points. None of the sites had 0 points or 

2.5, starting with two sites with 5 points (signs only near to the site or in the site) and 

six with 7.5 points (sings on the main road access and in the site showing it is a touristic 

place, historical place or geological site). 

  

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.1.: 

? All must have sings s?ow?n? “ot??r s?t?s” from t?? Gol??n Geopark. Since there 

is only a main road that links to secondary ones it is important to put in the main 

road (E75) and in the roads that leads to these sites signs showing is “other site” 

from the Golden Geopark. Related with the trails, mostly of them have a board 

information at their starting point being also important to mention the other sites 

on these information boards. 

 

In this way the average could rise from 6.87 or 0.13 points to 10 points or 0.2 

points. 

 



130 

 

B.2. The current use of the other site in terms of geological/historical interest (2%) 

Here the average was very good with 9.68 points or 0.19 points in 0.2 points, 

better than in the geosites but lower than in the gold historical sites. None of the sites 

had 0 or 2.5 points (site without any type of promotion or site with promotion only in 

internet); being only one site with 7.5 points (promotion in internet and books, leaflets, 

maps or in information board), and seven with the maximum points (interpretative 

centre explaining the site).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.2.: 

? 1. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave: having a small interpretative centre for 

example in Tankavaara Visitor Centre or in the mineral exhibition from 

Tankavaara International Gold Museum or other partner with a space to do an 

exhibition could rise the points of this site from 7.5 to 10, but as there is already 

a board information in this site and all information centres know this place is not 

a must to create something more. 

 

This sub-criterion could have instead of 9.68 or 0.19 points, the maximum points 

10 or 0.2 points. 

 

B.3. The current use of the other site for other types of interests (2%) 

 This sub-criterion didn´t had so much high average being only 6 points or 0.12 

in 0.2 points but still better than in the geosites and in the gold historical sites. The 

results vary between two sites with 3 points (site integrated in a non-circular walking 

trail and ski trail or non-circular trail, walking or ski trail, and non-circular boat/canoe 

route); three with 5 points (site integrated in a circular walking trail or sky trail or site 

integrated in circular boat/canoe route); one with 7 points (site with a circular walking 

trail and ski trail or circular trail, walking or ski trail, and circular boat/canoe route) and 

finally two with 10 points (site with other type of interest(s), with promotion and/ or 

use). Fortunately, none had 0 or 1 points (site without any kind of interest, promotion 

and/or use or site with other types of interest without promotion and/ or use).   

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.3.: 

As mostly of the sites have some kind of hiking trail, ski trail or canoe route 

even if they are not all circular routes it is not a must to do alterations in the sites. 



131 

 

B.4. Use limitations of the other site (4%) 

 In this sub-criterion the average was lower than in the geosites and in the gold 

historical sites, with 6.87 or 0.27 in 0.4 points. None of the sites had 0 points (site 

impossible to be visited); starting with three sites with 2.5 points (site with restrictions 

like private property, opening hours, etc.); one with 7.5 points (physical restrictions like 

fences, obstacles, etc.) and four with 10 points (without any restrictions).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion B.4.: 

Here nothing needs be changed since all the sites can be visited. 

 

C. Logistics (25%) 

C.1. Cleanliness (5%) 

 This sub-criterion had an average of 8.43 or 0.42 in 0.5 points, higher than in the 

geosites and in the gold historical sites. There was no sites with cleaning problems (0 or 

2.5 points) being all the sites clean but with some differences between them, one 

received 5 points being clean but without rubbish bins; three with 7.5 points being clean 

and with a rubbish bin less than 5 km from the site, and four with 10 points, clean site 

with rubbish bins. 

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.1.: 

Like it happened in the geosites and gold historical sites, here is not necessary to 

do alterations, of course to reach the 10 points it could be placed in every single site a 

rubbish bin but as all sites are clean even when they don´t have a rubbish bin, it is not a 

must to do changes in this sub-criterion.  

 

C.2. Toilets (5%) 

 Here the average was 7.93 points or 0.39 in 0.5 points, better than in the geosites 

and gold historical sites. Having here one site with 1 point (site located more than 5 km 

from a toilet); one with 2.5 points (site located less than 5 km from a toilet); none of the 

sites had 5 points (toilets less than 1 km from the site) or 7.5 points (toilets less than 200 

metres from the site), and being the rest of the sites (six) with 10 points (toilets in the 

site).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.2.: 



132 

 

In this sub-criterion is not a must to improve since there is always dry toilets in 

mostly of the trails for people when hiking, canoeing, etc., one thing which could justify 

the creation of more dry toilets or other types of toilets is for example if the number of 

visitors doing outdoor activities increases considerably.  

 

C.3. Restaurants (5%) 

 In this sub-criterion the average was quite low, with 2.75 points or 0.13 in 0.5 

points but still a little bit better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. None of the 

sites reached the 10 or 9 points (restaurant less than 300 metres from the site and open 

seasonally or all year round); being one site with 8 points (restaurant less than 1 km 

from the site); one site with 4 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 km); two sites with 

3 points (restaurant between 1 km and 5 km and it opens seasonally); two sites with 2 

points (restaurant between 5 km and 20 km) and two sites with 0 points (no restaurants 

less than 20 km from the site).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.3.: 

This was also a sub-criterion that nothing could be changed, of course in the 

trails there are fireplaces to make food but restaurants are quite far and of course it 

would be very expensive to build a restaurant in such a remote area. Also here only 

when the geopark starts to work it could be changed something, for example opening a 

café or restaurant all year round instead of shorter time or a construction of a new one if 

necessary. 

 

C.4. Accommodation (5%) 

 The average here was not so much satisfactory having only 4.87 points or 0.24 

in 0.5 points, still a little bit better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. Here is 

possible to observe two sites with 1 point (there is a hut for hikers in the trail or in the 

site); four sites with 5 points  (many types of accommodation less than 20 km); one with 

7 points (many types of accommodation less than 5 km) and one with 10 points (many 

types of accommodation less than 1 km).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.4.: 

 Here, like it happened with the restaurants, nothing can be changed at the 

moment, maybe in the future if necessary. 



133 

 

C.5. Local buses (5%) 

 This sub-criterion had also very low average, only with 3.75 points or 0.18 in 0.5 

points but the results were better than in the geosites and gold historical sites. Being 

three sites with 0 points (site more than 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus); one 

with 2 points (site located between 10 km and 20 km from the bus stop for a local bus); 

one with 4 points (site between 5 km and 10 km from a local bus stop); one with 6 

points (site between 1 km and 5 km from the bus stop); one with 8 points (site less than 

1 km from a bus stop) and one with 10 points (site with a bus stop – less than 300 

metres).  

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion C.5.: 

 Also here it is very difficult to change something at the moment, only in the 

future if necessary, the other options is renting a car or go by taxi.  

 

D. Perceptiveness (5%) 

D.1. Aesthetics (2.5%) 

 The results here were better than in the geosites and gold historical sites, with an 

average of 6.75 points or 0.16 points in 0.25 points, having three sites 5 points  

(pleasant site, with some moderately attractive elements -small dimension); two 7 points 

(pleasant site, with attractive elements, with visual impact); two 8 points (very attractive 

site, with a strong visual impact); and one 9 points (site extremely attractive, with a 

strong visual impact); none reaching the maximum points (10 points). 

 

Priority actions in the other sites to improve the sub-criterion D.1.: 

 As this sub-criterion is subjective, depends on the person´s opinion when is 

looking to the sites,  it will not be changed and since there is no sites with negative 

impact (rubbish spread all over the place) this sub-criterion will have the same average 

as before. 

 

D.2. Interpretative potential (2.5%) 

 This one had an average of 10 points or 0.25 in 0.25 points, the same as in the 

gold historical sites only being the geosites with lower results, this means that all the 

geological or historical elements are understandable to all types of public.

4.1.2. Degradation Risk  
 

Degradation Risk of the Geosites  

 

A. Legal Protection (20%) 

Mostly of the geosites are located in an area with legal protection but no control 

of access, having here twenty geosites with 5 points and the rest of the sites had 10 

points (sites in an area with no legal protection and without control of access). The 

average here is not so low but also not so high, having 5.83 or 1.16 points in 2 points. 

 

B. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas 

near, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)): 

The average here was quite low having only 0.79 points or 0.15 in 2 points, this 

happens because in the area of the geopark there is only gold panning made by 

enthusiasts but nothing related with big industrial mining. In this way, ten geosites had 

0 points (geosite located more than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or 

small scale degrading area/activity like for example gold prospecting); nine with 1 point 

(geosite located between 1 km and 5 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for 

example gold digging); and finally five geosites with 2 points (geosite located between 

50 metres and 1 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for example gold 

digging); none having more than this.  

  

C. Deterioration of geological elements (35%) 

 Here were the best results (0 points) being all geosites safe, without danger of 

deterioration. Of course in a future it is important to create a geoconservation plan to 

manage these geosites but fortunately the scenario is not an emergency.  

 

D. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) 

 Here none of the geosites was close to a bigger city (more than 15000 

inhabitants) or a bigger village (smaller than 15000 and bigger than 5000 inhabitants), 

being only three geosites less than 5 km from a village with couple hundred inhabitants 

or a touristic place (5 points); eight more than 5 km from a city, village or touristic 

place (2.5 points); and finally, thirteen in the wilderness (0 points). This makes this 

criterion with 1.45 points or 0.145 points in 1 point. 



137 

 

E. Accessibility (15%) 

E.1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) 

 Here mostly of the geosites, twenty one, were located more than 100 metres 

from a forest vehicle road or geosite located more than 500 metres from a paved road (1 

point); two with 5 points, located less than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or 

geosite located between 100-500 metres from a paved road; and only one with 10 

points, located less than 100 metres from a paved road with bus parking area (18. 

Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs). The average here is very low having 1.70 

or 0.12 points in 1 point. 

 

E.2. Boat and/or canoe access (7.5%) 

 In twenty four geosites, ten have boat and/or canoe access being four geosites 

with 10 points (located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or canoe place); one with 7 

points (located  between 100-500 metres from a boat and/or canoe place); one with 5 

points (located between 500 metres -1 km from a boat and/or canoe place); and finally, 

four with 1 point (located more than 1 km from a boat and/or canoe place). Having here 

an average of 5.6 points or 0.42 points in 0.75 points.  

 

The nature conservation and protection in Finland is very effective and strict 

resulting in a very impressive variety of protected areas. Furthermore, the population in 

this far north is quite sparse with some villages and no big cities, and all geosites are in 

quite good conditions making in this way an easier task to conserve the geosites. Of 

course it will be important in the future to create a specific plan to manage all the 

geosites since there is not yet one developed.  

 

 

Degradation Risk of the Gold Historical Sites 

 

A. Legal Protection (20%) 

 In terms of legal protection there is nineteen gold historical sites with 5 points 

(located in an area with legal protection but no control of access) and six with 10 points 

(located in an area with no legal protection and no control of access), none being locate 

in an area with legal protection and control of access or in an area without legal 



138 

 

protection but with control of access, making the average of 6.2 points or 1.24 in 2 

points. 

 

B. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas 

near, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)) 

 In the area of the geopark there is only gold panning made by enthusiasts but 

nothing related with big industrial mining activities, in this way none of the gold 

historical sites had more than 2 points. Having 2 points nineteen gold historical sites 

(site located between 50 metres and 1 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for 

example gold prospecting); five 1 point (located between 1 km and 5 km from a small 

scale degrading area/activity, for example gold prospecting); and one 0 points (located 

more than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or small scale degrading 

area/activity, for example gold prospecting). In this way the average here is very low, 

with 1.72 points or 0.34 points in 2 points. 

 

C. Deterioration of the historical elements (35%) 

 Unfortunately here there were gold historical sites with 10 points, three sites 

(deteriorated/in ruins already); five with 9 points (site already deteriorated/in ruins but 

with some small actions of protection and conservation); one with 8 points (possibility 

of deterioration of the main historical elements); two with 7 points (small possibility of 

deterioration of the main historical elements); and fourteen with 0 points (any danger of 

deterioration). Having in this way 3.88 of average or 1.35 points in 3.5 points.  

 

D. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) 

Here none of the gold historical sites was close to a bigger city (more than 15000 

inhabitants) or a bigger village (smaller than 15 000 inhabitants and bigger than 5000 

inhabitants), being only six sites less than 5 km from a small village with couple 

hundred inhabitants or a touristic place (5 points); one site more than 5 km from a city, 

village or touristic place (2.5 points); and finally, eighteen in the wilderness (0 points). 

Having a good average here with 1.875 or 0.14 points in 1 point.  

 

E. Accessibility (15%) 

E.1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) 



139 

 

 In this sub-criterion only one site had 5 points (located less than 100 metres from 

a forest vehicle road or located between 100-500 metres from a paved road, gold 

historical site nº 16. Carl Gustaf mine shaft) and the rest of them with 1 point (located 

more than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or located more than 500 metres from a 

paved road), having this sub-criterion 1.16 of average or 0.087 in 0.75 points. 

 

E.2. Boat and/or canoe accessibility (7.5%) 

 In twenty five gold historical sites, seventeen had boat and/or canoe access, 

being ten sites with 10 points (sites located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or 

canoe place) and seven with 1 point  (gold historical sites located more than 1km from a 

boat and/or canoe place), being the average of 6.29 or 0.47 points in 0.75. 

 

 Even though mostly of the gold historical sites are in an area with  legal 

protection (like it happens with the geosites), they are in remote areas and mostly of 

them are made of wood – material which gets bad with time. The critical cases are for 

example the sites 12. The Kerkelä mining village; 13. The Laanila white quartz rock and 

shaft; 14. The Kuivakuru pann?n? fac?l?ty; 15. G?n?ral’s m?n? s?aft an? 16. Carl Gustaf 

mine shaft (all belong to Laanila Gold Trail), those sites have board information and 

fences to protect the ruins (Figure 4.5.) still they are open (exposed to weathering that 

makes them degrading faster) and made of wood, in this way it could be implemented a 

more effective method to protect the ruins, like for example some kind of glass structure 

to cover the sites and people still could see them. The other gold historical sites which 

are in bad shape (already in ruins) because it is difficult to reach them and take care of 

all, the best scenario would be the restoration of all or, the other solution, the creation of 

some replicas but since this is a difficult task, the best option could be the continuation 

of the restoration and preservation works of some sites. The ones which are already in 

ruins and nothing can be done, a memorial on the place where they were could be a 

good idea. The International Gold Prospector Museum of Tankavaara does research and 

mapping of the old gold fields and with the collaboration of National Heritage Services 

(Metsähallitus) creates volunteer camps to restore some historical buildings, it could be 

developed more camps and including now the younger generations like for example 

students and scouts to create consciousness and awareness about these sites.

Other Sites Degradation Risk 

 

A. Legal Protection (20%) 

 Here, mostly of the sites were in an area with legal protection but no control of 

access (five sites with 5 points); two with 7.5 points (being in a rea with no legal 

protection but with control of access); and one with 1 point (having control of access as 

well as being in an area with legal protection); none of them being in an area with no 

legal protection and no control of access (10 points). Having in this way an average of 

5.12 or 1.02 in 2 points. 

 

B. Proximity to areas/activities with high possibilities to cause degradation (urban areas 

near, roads and railways, industrial mining activities, etc. (20%)) 

 In this criterion the results were very good being seven sites with 0 points 

(located more than 5 km from a potential degrading area/activity and/or small scale 

degrading area/activity, for example gold prospecting) and only one with 1 point (site 

located between 1 km and 5 km from a small scale degrading area/activity, for example 

gold digging); having this criterion a very low average of 0.12 points or 0.024 in 2 

points. 

 

C. Deterioration of geological/historical elements (35%) 

 Also here the average was very good having only 0.87 points or 0.3 points in 3.5 

points, being seven sites with 0 points (with no danger of deterioration) and only one, 1. 

The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave, with 7 points (having a small possibility of deterioration of 

the main geological elements).  



141 

 

D. Proximity with villages, cities and touristic places (10%) 

 Here none of the sites had more than 2.5 points, having 2.5 points five sites 

(more than 5 km from a city, village or touristic place); and three with 0 points (site in 

the wilderness), reaching in this way an average of 1.56 points or 0.156 points in 1 

point.  

 

E. Accessibility (15%) 

E. 1. Terrestrial Accessibility (7.5%) 

 The accessibility was quite good having only an average of 1.5 or 0.11 points in 

0.75 points, being seven sites with 1 point (located more than 100 metres from a forest 

vehicle road or site located more than 500 metres from a paved road) and one with 5 

points (located less than 100 metres from a forest vehicle road or located between 100-

500 metres from a paved road).  

 

E.2. Boat and/or canoe access (7.5%) 

 In eight sites, five have canoe and/or boat access being four sites with 10 points 

(located less than 100 metres from a boat and/or canoe place) and only one with 1 point 

(located more than 1km from a boat and/or canoe place), being the average here quite 

high with 8.2 or 0.61 in 0.75 points. 

 

 Here mostly of the sites are in an area with legal protection and the degradation 

risk is very low. The most problematic site is the number 3. The Korkia-Maura Ice Cave 

since its permafrost started to thaw in summer time due to the visits of tourists to this 

cave, even if the only way to go to this site is by boat which controls a little bit the 

number of visitors, maybe in the future it will be necessary to have a more strict 

entrance in the cave (for example: only one time per week with a little amount of people 

visiting or visitation only two times per month). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



142 

 

4.2. Interpretative contents for visitors (leaflets, panels, trails)  
 

? Härkäselän Kultala – Gem and Mineral Exhibition of Tankavaara 
International Gold Prospector Museum 

The Gem and Mineral Exhibition is a separate building from the museum which 

is going to hold an improved exhibition. There are three floors, the first one is not going 

be renovated due to the good quality of the exhibition but the last two are going to be 

rebuilt next summer (2017). Some ideas from the museum are being developed and 

others in this work (next it will be presented both, ideas from the museum and from this 

work): the second floor will hold some stones from Lapland with a very small 

explanation of each one and a simple geological time scale that tells the geological 

history of Finland, maybe this geological time scale could be done by  students from a 

local school. The third floor will be presented with some history of geology where it is 

planned to show some cases of the most notorious Finnish geologists as well as other 

prominent scientists in this area. Also in a different building from this museum or even 

in the interpretative centre of Tankavaara could be developed the explanation of each 

geosite of the Golden Geopark.  

 

? Sámi Museum and Northern Lapland Nature Centre Siida 

As this museum has a permanent and temporary exhibition, in the temporary one 

could be developed diferent types of exhibitions in different times of the year with 

subjects like geoparks, geoconservation, geotourism, among others related with those 

subjects. It could have also a temporary exhibition for a photograph competition  for the 

geosites, gold historical sites and other sites, and the best photos receive a prize. 

 
? Information boards: 

Related with the information boards in the Golden Geopark of Lapland, it could 

be used only in the geosites (mostly because the gold historical sites and the other sites 

have more information boards) nearer the road (less than 2 km from the road) like for 

example 18. Hummocky moraine area at Kirakkaköngäs; 19. The Rahajärvi collapsed 

cliff, among others. In the most remote geosites no information boards at all because the 

creation for each geosite an information board takes the feeling of being in such a 

remote area (in the wilderness) and of course the costs to maintain them are higher than 

the ones nearer the road.   



143 

 

? Books 

It could be developed a practical book with a map to take to the 

hiking/canoeing/boat trip. The visitors could buy or borrow these materials from an 

information centre (partner of the geopark) or from the nearest point of the trail like an 

accommodation place, restaurant, etc. The book and the map should have three levels 

for three different types of public (level 1, 2 and 3 - like it happens with some materials 

of the Basque Coast Geopark where they develop information for different types of 

public): the first level is a very basic map and book for children and people who wants 

simple information, the second level is more difficult for children to understand and 

adults have to have a certain interest for the subject and the third level is for adults who 

knows at least a little bit more geology than the rest of the general public, being this last 

level the information more detailed. The books and maps should be made from a 

material very resistant to water and practical to open and read. 

 
? Downloaded information 

As many sites are in the wilderness and there is no internet connection at all, one 

thing that could be developed is for example information to be downloaded for the 

cellphone before starting a trail. This could be created to Lemmenjoki area and Ivalojoki 

area too, where information about geosites, gold historical sites, other sites and other 

helpful content are presented. People should be aware that there is no electricity in the 

trails, so saving the battery of the cellphone is something important.  

 
? Hiking trails, ski trails and canoe routes 

The area of the Golden Geopark of Lapland is an excellent place for nature 

lovers providing good hiking trails, ski trails, canoe routes (many well-marked and 

others not marked for people with more experience and orientation skills); trails for 

different types of public (adventure people, families, among many others) all with day 

huts and overnight huts, fireplaces and dry toilets, having this area many ways to see the 

geosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites. Some details need to be improved 

in the trails, like for example in the Lemmenjoki trail and the Pahaoja – Kultala 

Gold Mining Village trail, at the beggining of both there is an information board (Figure 

4.6.) for hikers about the rules, the infrastructures (huts, firepalces, dry toilets, among 

others) and a map showing everything in the area, for a better map should be mention 

the geosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites of the area as well as the canoe 



144 

 

and ski routes. Some parts of these trails should be better signed and it is necessary to 

create in some areas new trails (already explained in 4.1.1.Touristic value assessment).  

Finishing the ideas about the trails, the trails in the area of the geopark don´t 

need to have a specific theme (e.g.: one trail talks about the ice age; other about the 

Greenstone belt), instead of this one trail can be used for different types of themes (e.g.: 

in one trail is possible to talk about the Ice Age, the Greenstone Belt, The Era of 

Weathering, among others). Some geosites are far from the road so there is no 

information boards making in this way more flexible to explain different types of 

themes, if it has a board information is not a problem because is still possible to connect 

to other subjects.

145 

 

 

  
 

Figure 4.6. Lemmenjoki map (a) and Pahaoja – Kultala Gold Mining Village map (b). 

 

Related with the canoe and boat routes, there should be signs like an high pole 

with a distinctive color that is not similar with the colors of the surrounding nature on 

the river banks to show the geosites, the gold historical sites and the other sites for 

canoeists and people with a boat.  

 

? Other interpretative materials and activities 

In the geological trail of Tankavaara there is an information board at the 

beginning of the trail about the geological features of the area as well as six boxes under 

it that are made for play a game (Figure 4.7). In this game, inside of those boxes are 

some leaves, stones, wood sticks among other natural materials and people have to try 

with their hands to guess what it is inside of each box. This game could be changed a 

little bit to geological purposes, like for example guessing by taking a stone away from 

a box which stone it is and after that check the information about the stone which is 

inside of each box, other idea could be a game where outside of each box there is an 

image (without a name) of  some geological features like an esker, gorge, hill, and so 

(b)

on, and students should guess which image is by writing down in a paper the name 

(esker, gorge, hill, etc.) and put it inside of the box where they think is the right image 

(this game could be played with teachers). This system could be implemented in more 

trails.

with some stones, leaves, among other materials from nature. 

 

? Libraries 

Publications of the Golden Geopark (eg.: application, papers from symposiums, 

conferences and future works) could stay in the library of Ivalo village in a small corner. 

Also the library car (a car that stops in each village and city to provide books for 

people) could have a place with the geopark publications or at least people could order 

them from this car. 

 

4.3. Definition of a geotourism strategy (web, marketing, publications, 
events, etc.) 
 
 

? Promotion  

 The Golden Geopark should promote itself as an area in the wilderness where 

people can explore the nature doing outdoor activities like hiking, canoeing, bicycling, 

gold prospecting, skiing, snowshoeing, among others, in a safe environment and with 

facilities for all kinds of public (outdoor people, families, younger and older groups) 

where geology, gold history and indigenous people are the main theme of the geopark. 

As the tourism in this area is quite seasonal, the geopark can help to promote Lapland 

all year round due to the creation of more activities and quality service. 



147 

 

? Website of the Golden Geopark of Lapland project 
 
 Related with the website of the Golden Geopark of Lapland 

(http://goldengeopark.fi), some parts have to be improved. One of these parts is in the 

description of each geosite, gold historical site and other site and their accesses, where 

there is a map of the access (Figure 4.8.), these maps should show better how to get to 

the sites or at least a link to the Excursion maps (https://www.retkikartta.fi); other 

crucial point is to show which sites are open or not all year round because in the website 

is not so well explained.  

 

Figure 4.8.  Map on the Golden Geopark of Lapland website showing how to reach one of the sites. Some 

improvements should be done.  

 

Other small improvements should be done like for example in the introduction 

of the geopark. The website when speaks about the Golden Geopark of Lapland it just 

explains the projects which aimed to establish the geopark in this area, informing which 

were the responsible entities for the projects and its collaborators but it doesn´t say 

more, the only place which clarifies more is a link for the application of the geopark. 

For this reason, inside of the geopark website, it should have a little bit more of 

explanation about the geopark (a brief description of which is the main goal of the 

geopark, its philosophy, what is interesting to see in terms of geology, gold history and 

Sámi culture) not being only this information in the application form. Another idea, in 

the future, that could be applied in the geopark website, is a link promoting the partners 

with touristic activities (snowshoeing, snowmobile, ice-fishing, gold panning, etc.) and 

http://goldengeopark.fi/
https://www.retkikartta.fi/


148 

 

the partners with accommodation. One other good idea in the future, used in the Basque 

Coast Geopark, is to create a calendar in the website of the geopark showing its 

activities and people could book directly from the website. Also this website should be 

promoted in the touristic websites of the area as well as the activities of the geopark 

(eg.: inarisaariselka.fi).  

 

? Touristic magazines, newspapers and other places 

The geopark should promote itself in local touristic magazines and newspapers 

as well as its activities and events. Taking the idea from the Azores Geopark, where 

they have in their regional newspaper a regular page published twice a month talking 

about the geosites, other geoparks, promotion of the partners, events/actions made by 

the geopark, etc., the Golden Geopark could also promote itself in regional newspapers 

and magazines with interesting subjects. With this newspapers and magazines create 

competitions, quizzes too, involving in this way more people in the subjects of the 

geopark.  

The “capital” of Lapland is Rovaniemi (outside of the area of the geopark), 

being the entrance to Lapland, this makes this place an important point for information, 

for example put geopark information in the information centres of the city to promote 

the geopark. 

 

? Works to be developed by students 

It is a very important task for all geoparks to involve younger generations, for 

this reason the Golden Geopark should promote works/activities with students. One 

example that can be practiced is with the students of the University of Lapland in areas 

such as marketing, tourism, geology and environment. The activity/works can include 

work groups under the supervision of professors from the university and the groups 

could try to develop ideas, activities, strategies of nature conservation, marketing, 

among others in the area of the geopark. Also the development of summer camps or 

students exchange programs where students from other countries visit the Golden 

Geopark and develop some work related with the areas above mentioned it is an 

interesting task. 

 



149 

 

? For bus groups and individual visitors who do not want to do outdoor 

activities  

As many geosites, gold historical sites and other sites are quite far from a road, 

requiring in this way at least an hike, it should be developed some sites near the roads 

for these kind of public to explain the geology of the area as well as the gold history and 

the Sámi culture. The sites can be sites already existed in the geopark (near to the road, 

not requiring big effort or long time to reach them) or new ones, like for example in 

Kaunispää view point (where it is possible to see a 360º view of the area), the Ukonjärvi 

Panorama Café, the view point near Karhunpesäkivi, among other points where a bus 

can stop and people don´t need to walk so much. Related with the gold historical sites 

and the other sites there is already museums, so the creation of points to see them is not 

so necessary as in the geosites. 

 

 

? Development of touristic packages for different groups 

The Golden Geopark should create packages for different groups like for 

example families, schools, bus groups, people who like nature, very adventurous people 

and for different times of the year (winter, spring, autumn and summer). It should 

include accommodation, restaurants, trails, other nature activities and a different 

package for the most adventurous ones who like to spend the night in nature and like to 

do long distances.

Conclusions 
 

 The work developed here had the 57 sites of the Golden Geopark of Lapland 

project assessed in terms of their touristic value as well as their degradation risk. For the 

touristic value assessment this work was mainly based on the proposals by Pereira and 

Pereira (2012) and Gonçalves (2013) and for the degradation risk an adaptation was 

made from the proposal of Brilha (2016). The scientific value assessment was not 

developed here but it is a very important item to take into consideration in the future 

because it may give a clearer idea of the value of the sites.  

 For the touristic value assessment and the degradation risk it was necessary to do 

field work to check each geosite, gold historical site and other site. The field work took 

place in October of 2015 and May, June and July of 2016 since in winter time is quite 

difficult to check the sites. For the touristic value assessment it was defined four main 

criteria and eighteen sub-criteria using two methodologies, percentage methodology and 

points methodology, to compare the results. The results obtained were placed in 

different categories (“Insufficient”, “Sufficient”, “Good”, “Very Good” and 

“Excellent”). The geosites and the gold historical sites in both methodologies did not 

have so good results being the other sites with better values. When analysing all of them 

(57 sites) the results were not so high but also not so low being 62.77% and 6.24 points. 

Related with the degradation risk, the gold historical sites had higher values than the 

geosites and the other sites. 

 As the Golden Geopark of Lapland is at a beginning stage and still a project 

(failing to achieve the membership of the Geoparks Network in September 2015) more 

work has to be developed. The Geopark is already in an area with a very strong link to 

the tourism; great network of trails (marked ones and for the more adventurous and with 

orientating skills not marked trails), canoe routes, bike routes, ski routes, among others; 

with infrastructures to support people´s needs during the outdoor activities; good 

interpretative centres and a network of hotels, restaurants and other infrastructures for 

tourists.  On the other hand, the long distances to reach the sites; the long distances to 

reach infrastructures like hotels, restaurants, hospitals, among others; the lack of 

recognition of the geopark in the area (for example none of the sites had the logo of the 

geopark and some were quite difficult to locate due to the lack of signs) are negative 



152 

 

points that can be changed during the time finding the right solutions, the work created 

here can be a step for improving some of these gaps on the geopark. 

 To conclude, the main goals of this work were achieved and it has the main 

purpose to help the geopark to improve. In this way, the geopark can implement and 

create actions of conservation, promotion and mostly the valorisation of the sites. With 

the touristic improvement of the geosites, gold historical sites and other sites the 

geopark can provide a quality product and different in Lapland, enriching the area, 

always being the main goals the conservation and valorisation of the sites of the 

geopark.
