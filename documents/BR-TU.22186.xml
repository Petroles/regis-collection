RESUMO 
 
Apesar de sua reconhecida importância em termos de complexidade e biodiversidade, os estuários 
vêm sofrendo considerável processo de degradação gerado pela ação antrópica. Diversos estudos 
têm enfatizado o papel do macrobentos como indicador da qualidade ambiental desses ecossistemas, 
o que tem levado ao desenvolvimento de ferramentas e métodos baseados em seus atributos 
(abundância, biomassa, composição específica, etc.). Dentre esses, os índices bióticos têm sido 
preferidos em termos de precisão e de custo-benefício, sendo o AMBI (Índice Biótico Marinho) o mais 
aplicado, com sucesso, em várias áreas geográficas submetidas a diferentes fontes de impacto. 
Contudo, poucas informações a respeito da ecologia das comunidades macrobentônicas estão 
disponíveis para a costa atlântica da América do Sul, estando concentradas nas regiões sudeste e sul 
do continente. Dessa forma, o presente estudo teve como objetivos descrever a composição e 
distribuição do macrobentos de áreas estuarinas de Pernambuco, testando o efeito do tamanho da 
abertura da peneira (1,0mm x 0,5mm) e da profundidade de amostragem (0-10cm x 0-20cm) na 
descrição das associações da fauna e examinar a eficiência do AMBI na avaliação da qualidade 
ambiental desses estuários. As coletas ocorreram em Outubro-2007, em 14 pontos situados na costa 
de Pernambuco, sendo amostrados além do macrobentos, parâmetros físico-químicos de água 
(salinidade, temperatura, oxigênio dissolvido, amônia) e de sedimento (matéria orgânica, 
granulometria, potencial redox, nitrogênio-total), além do microfitobentos. Um total de 14.257 
indivíduos distribuídos em 78 táxons e com uma biomassa total de 83,64g foram observados. Em 
geral, as diferenças na retenção das peneiras foram importantes para a abundância total (já que a 
peneira de 1,0mm reteve apenas 28% dos indivíduos), sendo pouco evidente para a biomassa total 
(92% da biomassa). Por outro lado, em termos de profundidade de amostragem, o estrato de 0-10cm 
compreendeu quase todos os indivíduos (94% da abundância total), mas contribuiu apenas com 39% 
da biomassa total. Foram encontradas apenas relações significativas para o fator “peneiras” tanto 
para a diversidade N1 (ANOVA 2-way: F1;13=5,17; p=0,02) quanto para a estrutura das comunidades 
(ANOSIM 2-way: Rglobal= 0,142; p=0,002). Correlações significativas foram estabelecidas entre as 
variáveis nitrogênio total (r=0,860; p&lt;0,0001), matéria orgânica (r=0,801; p&lt;0,001) e microfitobentos 
(r=0,749; p=0,005 and r=0,795; p=0,002, para clorofila-a e feopigmentos, respectivamente) contra a 
abundância da fauna retida nas peneiras de 1,0mm e de 0,5mm. De modo geral, o macrobentos dos 
estuários estudados é composto por pequenas espécies (1,0-0,5mm), de modo que o uso da peneira 
de 0,5mm permite uma interpretação mais precisa dos dados; além disso, para a composição da 
fauna e abundância, a camada superficial (0-10cm) é claramente mais importante enquanto que, para 
biomassa, a camada de fundo (10-20cm) deve ser considerada. Para a avaliação da qualidade 
ambiental, o índice AMBI mostrou que todas as áreas estudadas apresentaram algum nível de 
distúrbio, variando de 2,395 (pouco poluído, Ariquindá) a 5,236 (fortemente poluído, Capibaribe). Em 
geral, todas as áreas estiveram dentro dos limites de pouco a moderadamente poluído, devido à 
grande proporção dos táxons Oligochaeta e Nematoda (espécies tolerantes, grupo ecológico III). O 
índice provou ser eficiente na detecção da qualidade desses estuários, embora sua aplicação para 
águas tropicais requeira algumas adaptações na classificação ecológica das espécies.

ABSTRACT 
 
Estuarine environments are known by its importance in terms of complexity and biodiversity; however, 
anthropogenic activities continue to have a detrimental effect on its biodiversity levels on a worldwide-
scale. Several studies have emphasized the role of benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of 
environmental quality status in these ecosystems, which have lead a growing number of tools and 
methods based on macrofauna attributes (abundance, biomass, species composition). Among them, 
biotic indices has been chosen in terms of accuracy and cost-benefit, being the AMBI (AZTI Marine 
Biotic Index) the most successfully applied to different geographic areas and under different impact 
sources. However, few studies regarding ecological characteristic of soft-bottom macrobenthic 
communities on the Atlantic coast of South America are available and thoroughly concentrated in the 
south and southeast coasts. Hence, the main objectives of this contribution were to describe 
composition and distribution of macrobenthos from estuarine areas of Pernambuco and tests if 
particular sieve mesh sizes (1.0mm x 0.5mm) and sampling depth (0-10cm x 0-20cm) alter the 
macrobenthic association descriptors; in addition, to examine the efficiency of AMBI index to evaluate 
the environmental quality of these estuaries. Samples for abiotic variables of water (salinity, 
temperature, dissolved oxygen and ammonia-N) and sediment (organic matter, granulometry, redox 
potential, total-N), microphytobenthos and also macrofauna were collected at fourteen estuarine sites 
located in Pernambuco coastline, in October 2007. A total of 14,257 individuals, from 78 taxa and with 
a biomass of 83.64gAFDW were observed. In general, the differences between 1.0mm and combined 
sieves retention are hardly evident for biomass but it is very important for the abundance (1.0mm sieve 
retained only 28% of total individuals but, at the same time, was responsible for 92% of total biomass). 
Regarding sampling depth, the top layer (0-10cm) presented almost all individuals (94% total 
abundance); however, contributed with only 39.06% of the overall biomass. Significant interactions 
were observed only for “mesh-sieve” factor in terms of diversity N1 (two-way ANOVA: F1;13=5.17; 
p=0.02) and community structure (two-way ANOSIM: Rglobal= 0.142; p=0.002). Pearson’s correlation 
have selected the variables total-N (r=0.860; p&lt;0.0001), organic matter (r=0.801; p&lt;0.001) and 
microphytobenthos (r=0.749; p=0.005 and r=0.795; p=0.002, for chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments, 
respectively) as the most fit for explaining the “changes” in fauna from 1.0mm to 0.5mm. The results 
showed that these estuarine macrobenthos were mainly composed by small species (1,0-0.5mm), 
thus the use of the 0.5mm sieve will permit a more accurate interpretation of the data; besides for taxa 
composition and abundance, the top layer (0-10cm) is clearly the most important whereas for biomass 
the bottom layer (10-20cm) presents this function. In terms of environmental quality, the AMBI index 
indicated that all ecosystems presented some level of disturbance, ranging from 2.395 (slightly 
disturbed, in Ariquindá) to 5.236 (heavily disturbed, in Capibaribe). According to the index, most sites 
were situated between the slightly-moderate disturbed boundaries, due to higher proportion of 
Nematoda and Oligochaeta, both assigned here as ecological group III. In summary, AMBI proved to 
be efficient in evaluating the quality status of Pernambuco estuaries, although its applicability in 
tropical waters requests some adaptations in species’ ecological groups. 
 
 
Keywords: macrobenthos, sieve mesh-size, sampling depth, AMBI index, environmental quality

GENERAL INTRODUCTION  

 Estuaries and coastal marine waters are ranked among the most important aquatic 

systems on Earth in terms of ecological and economic significance (Nalesso et al., 2005). 

Estuaries are ecotones that play a fundamental role in enriching, by nutrient loads, the adjacent 

areas (Christian et al., 1991; Howarth and Marino, 2006; Lacerda et al., 2006; Boynton et al., 

2008); besides, they have singular characteristics according to their geomorphology, water 

circulation, salinity and temperature variations (Yáñez-Arancibia, 1987; Branco, 2001). These 

ecosystems comprise approximately 8-15% of the coastal regions in the world (Kennish, 1992; 

Bonecker et al., 2007) and are important areas for reproduction, nursing and feeding of at least 

one stage of the life-cycle of several invertebrates and fishes, including high commercial value 

species (Muniz and Venturini, 2001; McLusky and Elliot, 2004; Joyeux et al., 2004).  

However, a major scientific conclusion of the past century is that human population is 

changing Earth’s ecosystems in fundamental ways and the population has been increasing 

rapidly in the coastal zones, resulting in a multitude of ecological stresses on aquatic systems, 

especially estuaries (Flemer and Champ, 2006). Anthropogenic activities, such as habitat 

modification, pollution and overexploitation of living resources, continue to have a detrimental 

effect on global biodiversity levels and subsequent provision of estuarine resources (Jackson et 

al., 2001; Loreau et al., 2001); moreover, many estuaries are being used as repositories for 

industrial effluents and domestic wastes (Ramos et al., 2006). 

As coastal zone management strategies become more imperative, objective and 

interdisciplinary, studies are necessary to understand the ecological boundaries of its 

ecosystems, in order to protect – and conserve – its resources (Bonetti et al., 2004). Therefore, 

it is essential to realize how ecosystems function, since this type of information is crucial in the 

elaboration of conservation strategies (Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006). 

The benthic environment is a fundamental compartment within any aquatic ecosystem. 

Bottom sediments constitute a source of nutrients for the water column above having an 

important position in the benthic-pelagic coupling (Jørgensen, 1996; Venturini et al., 2004). 

There, benthic organisms alter the physical and chemical conditions at the sediment-water 

interface, promote the decomposition of organic matter, recycle nutrients for photosynthesis and 

transfer energy to other food-web components (Gaston et al., 1998). Therefore, they may be 

regarded better pollution indicators than the instantaneous water quality measurements 

(Nalesso et al., 2005). 

Benthic faunal organisms are considered excellent tools to monitor the environmental 

health of estuaries (Caeiro et al., 2005). Among them, macrobenthic communities provide an 

ideal measure of its response to disturbance (natural or man-induced), which made them known 

as effective indicators of pollution impacts in estuarine ecosystems (Engle et al., 1994; 

Weisberg et al., 1997; Borja et al., 2000). Their advantages as pollution indicators may be 

pointed out: (i) rapidly response to anthropogenic and natural stress in both spatial and 

temporal scales (Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978; Dauer, 1993; Fleischer et al., 2007); (ii)

restricted mobility avoiding unfavorable conditions on water/sediment (Weisberg et al., 1997; 

Borja et al., 2003a; Reiss and Krönche 2005); (iii) important function in cycling nutrients and 

materials between the underlying sediments and the overlying water column (Borja et al., 

2003a); and (iv) taxonomic diversity that can usually be classified into different functional 

response groups (Smith et al., 2001). 

The biological integrity of macrobenthic communities had traditionally been 

characterized by measures of abundance, diversity, or the presence of pollution indicators 

(Engle et al., 1994) since disturbances promote changes on community structure. The analysis 

of changes in these communities, using univariate and multivariate methods has taken an 

important part in the assessment and monitoring of marine and coastal environments (Warwick 

and Clarke, 1993; Muniz et al., 2005). Single community attribute measures or individual-

species data combinations, including species diversity, evenness or abundance/biomass ratios 

are used to sum up data beyond the level of individual species (Caeiro et al., 2005), however 

these measures have proven to be of not great help for estuarine environments monitoring 

which have highly variable natural conditions (Engle et al., 1994). Conversely, multivariate 

methods are more sensitive in characterizing benthic patterns (Warwick and Clarke, 1993), but 

the results obtained are usually too complex to be understood by non-scientists (Smith et al., 

2001; Muniz et al., 2005). 

In more recent studies, biotic indices were developed as easily-understood tools of 

ecological changes, which have clear practical application in the achievement of environmental 

quality (Borja, 2006). Such indices estimate macrobenthic community disturbance level and 

establish the ecological status of soft-bottom benthos (Weisberg et al., 1997; Borja et al., 2000; 

Simboura and Zenetos, 2002; Llansó et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2004), in addition, most are 

based in the concept of sensitive/tolerance taxa (Carvalho et al., 2006). According to Diaz et al. 

(2004), the majority of indices currently available are designed for use in freshwater streams, 

rivers and/or lakes (58%), but a significant number of indices are on hand for the assessment of 

estuarine and coastal marine systems (33%). Of these, the scale of applicability ranges from 

local (Xu et al., 2001) to regional (Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity, B-IBI, Llansó et al., 2003) and 

global (AZTI Marine Biotic Index, AMBI, Borja et al., 2000, 2003a) areas. 

One of the indices extensively applied with good results is the AZTI Marine Biotic Index 

– AMBI (Borja et al., 2000). The index is based on the classification of macrobenthic species in 

ecological groups corresponding to different sensitivity levels, making it suitable to all data sets 

including the small ones (Bigot et al., 2008). It has been tested under different stress sources 

such as submarine outfalls, heavy metals, harbour construction, dredging, diffuse pollution 

(mines, agriculture) and river inputs (e.g. Borja et al., 2003a,b; Muxika et al., 2003; Muxika et 

al., 2005) and has been applied not only in Europe (Borja et al.,,2000; Borja et al., 2003a,b; 

Muxika et al., 2003; Salas et al., 2004; Caeiro et al., 2005; Muxika et al., 2005; Albayrak et al., 

2006; Carvalho et al., 2006a,b; Sanz-Lázaro and Marin, 2006; Aguado-Giménez et al., 2007; 

Borja et al., 2007; Chainho et al., 2007; Dauvin et al., 2007; Fleischer et al., 2007; Muxika et al., 

2007a,b; Pontil et al., 2007; Pravoni et al., 2007; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2007; Teixeira et

al., 2007; Zettler et al., 2007; Afli et al., 2008; Blanchet et al., 2008; Munari and Mistri, 2008; 

Puente et al., 2008; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2008; Teixeira et al., 2008a,b; Pinto et al., 

2009) but also in Asia (Cai et al., 2003), northern Africa (Bazairi et al., 2005; Bakalem et al., 

2009), North America (Borja et al., 2008), South America (Muniz et al., 2005) and the southwest 

Indian Ocean (Bigot et al., 2008), allowing correct assessment of the ecosystem’s conditions. 

One negative aspect of the index is that since the list of species was created based on 

ecological characteristics from temperate benthic fauna, the ecological role of one (or more) 

specie(s) may differ with the environmental context and area (Labrune et al., 2006), which 

implies in reviewing the assignment of ecological groups. Moreover, appropriate assignments 

are neither necessarily available (Muniz et al., 2005; Flaten et al., 2007) nor easy to achieve 

outside European coasts, where AMBI was first developed (Bigot et al., 2008). This index 

presents some limitations when the number of species is very low or when studying low-salinity 

locations (e.g. the inner part of estuaries) (see Borja and Muxika, 2005). 

Biotic indices have been proposed as synthetic methodologies and its attributes should 

be precision and cost-effectiveness (Pontil et al., 2007), consequently it is important to verify 

whether one of the main source of sampling variation – specifically sieve mesh-size – affects 

the accuracy of benthic community based on indices calculation (Pinto et al., 2009). Commonly, 

1.0 and 0.5mm sieves are used for macrobenthic pollution monitoring (Eleftheriou and Holme, 

1984; Bachelet, 1990; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996; Rodrigues et al., 2007) however, most 

surveys have shown that small species associated to organic pollution are usually not retained 

by 1.0mm mesh sieve and due to that biased results may arrive from different methodologies 

(Thompson et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 2007). 

Despite tropical and subtropical coastal ecosystems comprise more than one third of 

world’s continental shelf area, not only basic information on ecology of soft-bottom benthic 

communities is still lacking but also their response to disturbance, especially in coastal areas of 

some countries submitted to intense and unplanned anthropogenic activities (Muniz et al., 

2005). According to Pagliosa and Barbosa (2006), studies concerning the ecology of soft-

bottom benthic macrofauna communities in estuarine systems in the South America Atlantic 

coast are recent and in most cases there is no historical data or long-term monitoring programs. 

Besides, such studies are concentrated in south and southeast coasts, where the impacts on 

estuarine systems only have been registered in obvious cases of severe pollution (Venturini et 

al., 2004).  

In Pernambuco State, northeast coast of Brazil, estuarine zones are the most affected 

by anthropogenic influences (e.g. sewage, removal of native mangrove forests for sugar-cane 

monocropping, industries such as chlor-alkali, fertilizers, agricultural defensives, paper mills, 

aluminum, and others) (CPRH, 2006). As a consequence, it is necessary to propose 

instruments and methodologies which permit to express the structural and functional quality of 

the benthic communities in order to achieve sustainability and conservation of these tropical 

ecosystems.

This study attempted to fill some of the scarcity concerning ecological information of 

tropical macrobenthic communities through two chapters, the first one focus on comparative 

surveys of macrobenthos from estuarine areas of Pernambuco and test if particular sieve mesh 

sizes and sampling depths alter the interpretation of macrobenthic assemblages’ descriptors; 

the second one intend to examine the efficiency of AMBI to evaluate the environmental quality 

of these estuaries.

CHAPTER I. Macrobenthic community structure in tropical estuarine ecosystems 
(Northeast, Brazil): the effect of sieve mesh-size and sampling depth on 
abundance, biomass and composition. 
 

I.1. Introduction 

 The description of the patterns of species distribution, biomass and abundance with 

accuracy is crucial, since it provides the basis for most ecological research (Benedetti-Cecchi et 

al., 1996). In benthic communities, it can be directly influenced by sampling procedures such as 

number of samples, taxonomic resolution, sieve screen (Bachelet, 1990; James et al., 1995; 

Tanaka and Leite, 1998) and sampling depth (Schaffner, 1990; Flach and Heip, 1996). 

 Sieves mesh-sizes commonly used for macrobenthic studies are 0.5mm and 1.0mm 

(Eleftheriou and Holme 1984; James et al., 1995). Depending on the survey’s purpose (e.g. 

population dynamics studies), it is imperative to determine the adequate sieve size before 

initiating any scale-sampling exercise (Mahadevan and Patton, 1979). In monitoring 

programmes, the assessment of macrobenthic community structure and productivity is a long 

and costly process that involves sorting, identifying and measuring large numbers of small 

organisms from the material collected (Gruenert et al., 2007). Therefore, many pollution-

monitoring studies adopt the 1.0mm sieve as the most cost-effective method for balancing 

logistic constraints while maintaining the capacity to detect ecological changes (Lampadariou et 

al., 2005). Nevertheless, sieve efficiency varies with taxonomic group and for individual species 

in the same taxonomic group (Rodrigues et al., 2007); moreover, it is known that small species 

related to organic enrichment are able to pass through the 1.0mm mesh sieve (Schlacher and 

Wooldridge, 1996a,b; Teixeira et al., 2007), determining the use of finer sieves. Therefore, the 

choice of a particular mesh size may establish the reliability of results and, consequently, the 

detection of an impact (Thompson et al., 2003; Lampadariou et al., 2005).   

 Comparative studies on the influence of different sieve sizes on macrobenthos 

composition have been done especially on communities of temperate marine and coastal areas, 

such as Mediterranean (Benedetti-Cecchi et al., 1996; Lampadariou et al., 2005, 2008), North 

America (Ferraro and Cole, 1990; Ferraro et al., 1994, 2006; Gruenert et al., 2007), Iberian 

Peninsula (Rodrigues et al., 2007), Australia (James et al., 1995), South Africa (Schlacher and 

Wooldridge, 1996a,b)  and Antarctica (Thompson et al., 2003) and also deep-sea zones (Gage 

et al., 2002). Information concerning the effect of sieves on tropical macrobenthic communities 

is still restrict (e.g. macrophytes-associated invertebrate assemblages), face of number and 

diversity of surveys on the theme (Tanaka and Leite, 1998). 

The importance of sediment sampling depth for the macrobenthos community descriptor 

is focused in most literature dealing with benthic vertical distribution (Schaffner, 1990; Weston, 

1990; Flach and Heip, 1996; Kumar, 1997; Mannino and Montagna, 1997; Flach et al. 1998; 

Ingole et al., 1999; Wei, 2006). All these surveys showed some trend for abundance (sampling 

the upper centimeters of sediment column corresponded to higher proportion of macrofauna 



 
 
 

12

individuals) but not for biomass profiles; in addition, as for sieves’ information, the subject is 

mainly explored in temperate areas (and also deep-sea zones) in contrast to tropics (e.g. 

Gutiérrez et al., 2000). 

This study investigates the role of sieve mesh-size and sampling depth on the quality 

and interpretation of data obtained, in order to contribute to a better knowledge of such effects 

when describing distribution and composition of tropical macrobenthic communities. 

 

 

I.2. Material and Methods 

I.2.1. Description of studied areas 

  The study was undertaken at estuarine areas situated along the 187km coastline of 

Pernambuco State, Brazil’s northeast (fig.01). Great part of these estuaries is designated as 

Environmental Protection Area by the State Law n.9.931, December 1986 (Noronha, 2008). 

 The Santa Cruz Channel constitutes of a U-shaped estuarine channel situated 50 km 

north from Recife, capital of Pernambuco State. This estuarine system separates the Itamaracá 

Island from the mainland; the whole area (730km²) has an extension of 22 km, variable widths 

(of 0.6 to 1.5 km) and depths (from 4-5m to less than 2m). From north to south, the channel 

receives continental influence through a number of rivers (Flores-Montes et al., 2002), being 

Botafogo and Igarassu rivers the major freshwater sources (Medeiros and Kjerfve, 1993) and 

also the most polluted (Silva et al., 2003). The region presents high ecological importance 

(Murolo et al., 2006), however is exposed to agro-industrial and urban activities, mainly the 

sugar cane monoculture and intensive fisheries. Two sites were chosen, one close to the 

Itapissuma Bridge, named Itapissuma (07°46’31.20’’S and 34°53’26.76’’W), and the other, more 

to the north, Sta Cruz Channel (07°46’13.12’’S and 34°52’58.19’’W) (fig.02A). 

The Paripe river site (07°48’38.76’’S and 34°51’23.28’’W) (fig.02A) is located in 

southern Itamaracá Island; the river has 4km of extension and 1.6km length. The mangrove is 

composed by Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa and 

Conocarpus erectus (the last three in smaller proportion). The anthropic action is still at a 

minimum, the local population living basically of subsistence agriculture and fishing (Santos and 

Coelho, 2001). 

The Timbó river site (07°51’18.72’’S and 34°50’33.96’’W) (fig.02B) is located in the 

north coast of Pernambuco, about 35km from Recife. The hydrographic basin comprises 

92.46km², representing 6.8% of the north coast; its depth ranges from 2 to 8m (Figueiredo et al., 

2007). The estuarine area exhibits expressive mangrove vegetation and for a long period was 

considered as non-polluted (Costa and Macêdo, 1989). Nowadays, it is under strong 

anthropogenic pressure as a result of intensive fishery activities, domestic sewage and 

industrial effluents (mainly steel mill and textile) and tourism (Grego et al., 2004).  

The Paratibe river site (07°57’37.44’’S and 34°49’48.54’’W) (fig.02B) is situated 

between Paulista and Olinda cities, in the north coast of Pernambuco, about 15km from Recife. 



 
 
 

13

The hydrographic basin occupies 118.54km² and a total extension of 16km (Pereira et al., 

2007). The estuarine area was relatively reduced as a consequence of rapid human occupation 

and mangrove deforestation (CPRH, 2006). Other sources of pollution consist of hospital and 

industrial effluents, domestic sewage (Pereira et al., 2007) and also slaughterhouse (CPRH, 

2006). 

 The Capibaribe river site (08°3’52.98’’S and 34°52’27.06’’W) (fig.02C) lies on the coast of 

Recife. The hydrographic basin comprises 7716km²; maximum depth 8m; tidal entry around 

15km from the Atlantic Ocean. Water temperature ranges from 26.2°C (rainy season) to 31°C 

(dry season); salinity varies considerably (0.05 to 36.0); surface and bottom dissolved oxygen 

saturation ranges from supersaturation to very low levels, with significant oxygen depletion 

during low tide (Travassos et al., 1993). Extensive mangrove areas have been destroyed, even 

though small patches of Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia 

schaueriana can be found (Paranaguá et al., 2005).  This estuarine system is eutrophic: water 

temperature and nutrient inputs from direct sewage effluents stimulate algal and bacterial 

growths. Discharges into the river include wastes from small industries (milk, detergents, soap, 

and leather, among others), inputs from polluted tributaries, namely Tejipió, Jordão, Pina and 

Beberibe rivers as well as direct sewage outfalls (Fernandes et al., 1999). 

 The Pina Basin is a complex estuarine area placed at the coast of Recife and separated 

from the ocean by a natural reef dyke, into which discharge the south arm of Capibaribe, 

Tejipió, Jiquiá, Jordão and Pina rivers (CPRH, 2006). The basin is about 3.6km with a total area 

of 2.02km². Salinity varies from 0.4 to 37.0 and water temperature from 27ºC to 32ºC. Because 

of the constant influx of nutrients from the rivers (especially domestic sewage), the Pina basin is 

hypereutrophic and organically polluted; even though its great biological potential has been 

exploited by the low-income population (Sommerfield et al., 2003). Two sites were selected, 

named Pina Basin1 (08°4’38.7’’S and 34°52’29.7’’W) and Pina Basin2 (08°5’27.0’’S and 

34°53’11.64’’W) (fig.02C). 

The Jaboatão river site (08°14’24.43’’S and 34°56’43.20’’W) (fig.02D) is placed about 

20km from Recife, in the south coast of Pernambuco. The river is part of a hydrographic basin 

with 413km² in area and 75km in length. Due to the fact of its basin draining six great cities, the 

river receives high load of pollutants such as untreated sewage, mill industry and cellulose 

manufacture (Souza and Tundisi, 2003). 

 The Pirapama river site (08°14’35.52’’S and 34°56’46.80’’W) (fig.02D) is also in the 

south coast of Pernambuco; together with Jaboatão river and its tributaries they formed the 

“Barra das Jangadas” estuarine system, being considered one of the major estuarine systems 

of Pernambuco State (Branco, 2001). According to Cavalcanti et al. (2008), the development of 

industries (especially sugar cane mills) and irregular human occupation along the margins 

constitute the main problems of its hydrographic basin (about 600km² and 70km length).  

 The estuaries of rivers Ipojuca and Merepe jointly with Tatuoca and Massangana used 

to discharge in the Suape Bay system (south coast of Pernambuco). However, with the 

implementation of an Industrial Port Complex (created in 1980) the two former rivers had their 



 
 
 

14

connection with the bay interrupted by the intensive embankment to build the port (Silva et al., 

2004a). As a result, more than 600 hectares of mangrove have been deforested, affecting the 

ecological balance and resilience of several species (Koening et al., 2002). One site was 

chosen in the junction of these rivers, named Ipojuca-Merepe (08°24’39.66’’S and 

34°58’28.62’’W) (fig.02E). 

Maracaípe river site (08°32’21.42’’S and 35°00’21.72’’W) (fig.02E) lies on Ipojuca city, 

in the south coast of Pernambuco. This area, formed by dense forests of Laguncularia 

racemosa, has been exploited especially by ecotourism (Mendonça and Almeida-Cortez, 2007). 

 Ariquindá river site (08°41’22.74’’S and 35°06’08.22’’W) (fig.02F) is placed nearly 

Carneiros beach, also in the south coast of Pernambuco (Silva et al. 2004b). The river 

integrates the estuarine system of Rio Formoso which presents a great level of preservation, 

despite some agricultural enterprises, tourism activities and lack of sanitation in the urban 

centers from the region (Medeiros, 2005). 

Mamucabas river site (08°46’41.81’’S and 35°06’27.46’’W) (fig.02F) stands in 

Tamandaré city, about 110km from Recife, in the south coast of Pernambuco. The river (&gt;30km 

of extension) originates in the interior of the Saltinho Biological Reserve (15,5km from 

Tamandaré bay), borders its urban area and crosses either agricultural or forested areas 

(Araújo and Costa, 2006). 

 
 
I.2.2. Sampling design 

Samples for geochemical variables and macrofauna were collected at fourteen sites in 

October 2007. Preliminary investigations were undertaken in these estuarine areas, being the 

sites chosen with base on sediment characteristics, water salinity and level of disturbance. In 

each site, five benthic quantitative replicates for macrofauna analyses were sampled with a 

cylindrical corer (area: 40.71cm², depth: 20cm), and separated in two layers: top (0-10cm) and 

bottom (10-20cm). All biological samples were preserved in 10% formaldehyde. Subsequently, 

samples from both layers were washed through 1.0 and 0.5mm mesh sieves and the material 

retained in each one was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with Rose Bengal. Sorting and 

counting were performed under stereomicroscope and specimens were identified to the lowest 

possible taxonomic level. 

Total abundance and biomass per replicate were calculated for the macrofauna retained 

on 1.0mm mesh sieve and combined sieves (1.0+0.5mm), in top layer (0-10cm) and combined 

layers (0-20cm) and results were compared for mesh-sieve (1.0mm x combined sieves) and 

sampling depth (0-10cm x 0-20cm) effects. For biomass, organisms were preserved in 

formaldehyde prior to weighting (wet weight); values were averaged into major taxonomic 

groups and then estimated as ash-free dry weight (g AFDW) from conversion factors according 

to Ricciardi and Bourget (1998). For the polychaete Laeonereis sp., however, the biomass (in 

AFDW) was obtained by measuring the 5th setiger diameter, in accordance with the growth 

models established by Florêncio (2000). 



 
 
 

15

As for macrofauna, five replicates were obtained for sediment environmental 

descriptors, which include, granulometry, organic matter, nutrients-total-N (cylindrical corer - 

area: 16.62cm², depth: 2cm) and redox potential (Eh), measured in field, in top (~2cm) and 

bottom (~20cm) layers. Microphytobenthos was also sampled at each site, with a smaller corer 

(area: 1.13cm², depth: 2cm). One single measure was carried out for water variables: salinity 

and ammonia-N. All methodologies applied to determine such parameters are presented in 

table 01:

I.2.3. Statistical analysis 

Analyses were performed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The distribution 

and composition of macrobenthic communities in relation to mesh sieve and sampling depth 

were ascribed in terms of abundance (N), biomass (g AFDW) and density (individuals/m²). 

Univariate indices such as number of species (S), Shannon diversity index (H’ loge) and 

evenness (J’) were also presented using the PRIMER v6.0 software package (Clarke and 

Gorley, 2006). 

 Analysis of Variance (two-way ANOVA) was carried out to determine whether diversity 

(as measured by Hill’s diversity index N1 or exp=H’) varied with the sieves (1.0mm x combined 

sieves) and also with the sampling depths (0-10cm x 0-20cm) in the macrobenthic samples. N1 

values were chosen instead of H’ by the fact that the Hill’s index seems to allow a better 

distribution of diversity values when compared to Shannon index, which “is so narrowly 

constrained in most circumstances can make interpretation difficult” (Magurran, 2004). Results 

for each interaction (mesh-sieves x sites and sampling depths x sites) were treated separately. 

In order to check the assumption of homoscedasticity, Bartlett’s tests were applied.   When 

significant differences among sites in relation to each factor (sieves/sampling depths) were 

found, a posteriori comparisons were performed using LSD tests (Sokal and Rohlf, 1997).  The 

analyses of variance, Bartlett’s and LSD tests were calculated using STATISTICA v5.0 

computer program.   



 
 
 

16

For macrofauna comparison and descriptive purposes, multivariate techniques followed 

the standard methods according to Clarke and Warwick (1994). In order to reduce the clumping 

effect of some numerically dominant species, abundances were weighted by means of 

dispersion index (Di) of each species per sample (Clarke et al., 2006). Weighted abundance 

data were log (x+1) transformed and resemblances were calculated by Bray-Curtis similarity 

measure. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Analysis of Similarity (two-way ANOSIM) were 

used to plot differences among sites for quantitative data of macrofauna and to test for “mesh-

sieve” and “sampling depth” factors effects (also separately) respectively. When significant 

differences among sites for the macrobenthos communities in relation to each factor 

(sieves/sampling depths) were found, the Similarity Percentages procedure (two-way SIMPER) 

(Clarke, 1993) was applied to point out the taxa which contribute to distinguish each factor 

within the sites. MDS, ANOSIM and SIMPER were also conducted with PRIMER v6.0 software 

(Clarke and Gorley, 2006). Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association 

between sedimentological parameters and “changes” in the community structure due to the 

factors (only when there were significant differences). To verify these “changes” the following 

procedure was made: for each factor (sieves/sampling depths), the similarity matrix was 

obtained and values of similarity for each replicate (from each site) between factor levels 

(sieves: “1.0mm” and “combined sieves”/ sampling depths: “0-10cm” and “0-20cm”) were 

extracted from the matrix. After that, the average dissimilarity for each site was calculated, being 

used in Pearson correlation analysis (Average Dissimilarity = 100-Average Similarity). Pearson 

correlation analysis was performed in BIOESTAT v5.0 (Ayres et al., 2007).  

All statistics statements were based on a significance level of ? = 5%.

I.3. Results  

I.3.1. Environmental data 

 The fourteen sites presented variations in all abiotic data (tab.02): Salinity values 

ranged between 8 (in Mamucabas) and 40 psu (in Maracaípe), being the majority of sites 

sampled in polyhaline/euhaline zones. Nitrogenous compounds were differently distributed in 

water and sediment: Paratibe and Jaboatão showed high ammonia-N values in their waters 

while, in sediment, the Total-N concentrations were superior in Pina Basin2 and Sta Cruz 

Channel. Although the sand fraction have predominated in sediment composition of all sites, the 

fine fraction (%silt-clay) was important in Timbó estuary; despite that, sediment properties 

(represented as median grain size) presented homogeneous distribution among sites. Negative 

values were registered for redox potential in all sites, ranging from -169mV (in Itapissuma) to -

378mV (in Pina Basin2). In the latter area, organic matter content values were one of the 

highest, together with Capibaribe and Sta Cruz Channel.

I.3.2. Microphytobenthos 

 Sediment chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments concentrations presented both the highest 

values in Pina Basin2. Among the sites, the sediment chlorophyll-a biomass varied between 

6.06 (in Jaboatão) and 70.21?g/cm² whilst phaeopigments, from 5.86 (in Mamucabas) to 

98.75?g/cm² (fig.03).

are missing). 

 

 
I.3.3. Macrobenthic distribution and composition  

In the present study, a total of 14,257 individuals comprising 78 taxa were identified 

mainly belonging to annelids. Polychaeta was the most abundant (60% in 1.0mm and 48% in 

combined sieves) followed by Oligochaeta (31% and 35%, respectively) and Nematoda (6% and 

15%), being the other groups represented by less than 3%. Despite their recognized numerical 

dominance in meiobenthos, Nematoda retained in “macrobenthic sieves” (1.0+0.5mm) were 

responsible for almost 50% of Paripe and Sta Cruz Channel community abundances; besides, 

the presence of this taxon was registered in Paratibe, Capibaribe, Pina Basin1, Jaboatão, 

Pirapama and Mamucabas only with the use of the finer mesh sieve. The relative contribution of 

taxonomic groups within each site differed depending on the considered mesh size especially in 

Ipojuca-Merepe and Maracaípe, where the high dominance of Polychaeta observed in 1.0mm 

was replaced by Oligochaeta with the combined sieves (fig.04).

Merepe (IM); Maracaípe (Ma); Ariquindá (Ar); Mamucabas (Mm).  

 

Tubificidae species, nematodes, the polychaetes Streblospio sp., Laeonereis sp., 

Capitella sp., Mediomastus sp. and unidentified Nereididae made up over than 90% of the total 

abundance. In general, densities ranged from three to five times more for both sieves compared 

to 1.0mm, except from Pina Basin1, where the difference increased almost by an order of 

magnitude. Considering the studied areas, it was observed that most macrobenthic animals in 

combined sieves were mainly concentrated in four sites: Paripe (12.85%), Timbó (12.56%), 

Paratibe (11.73%) and Capibaribe (11.45%). In these areas, densities attained values equal or 

superior to 80,000 ind/m²; by contrast, Ariquindá was the only estuary that registered less than 

10,000 ind./m² (fig.05A).

Conversely, most areas showed little evidence of shifts in the vertical distribution of 

densities (fig.05B) and individual species, excepting in Mamucabas, where Tubificidae species 

were well-represented in both 0-10cm and 10-20cm strata.

data in studied areas considering the sampling depths. 

 
Concerning biomass, Mollusca composed more than 73% of overall (total biomass = 

83.64g AFDW), especially due to the high contribution of bivalves Macoma sp., Lucina sp. and 

Anomalocardia brasiliana, being the values of total biomass also concentrated in four sites: 

Jaboatão (25.67%), Ipojuca-Merepe (23.17%), Timbó (21.22%) and Pirapama (8.92%). Values 

ranged from 0.17g (1.0mm) – 0.30g (combined sieves) in Pina Basin2 to 21.24g (1.0mm) – 

21.47g (combined sieves) in Jaboatão (fig. 06A). Even though the great dominance of mollusks’ 

biomass has been evident in half of sites, in Capibaribe, Pina Basin1, Pina Basin2, Itapissuma, 

Mamucabas and Ariquindá polychaetes’ biomass values were higher and little affected by the 

mesh size.

The vertical macrofauna biomass-data stayed nearly constant in some sites, but in 

Timbó, Paratibe, Jaboatão, Pirapama and Ariquindá increased in different proportions with the 

depth (fig.06B).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Figure 06B. Biomass values (±SD), expressed in gAFDW, of macrobenthic fauna data in studied 
areas considering the sampling depths.  

 

In terms of univariate measures, evenness (J’) and diversity (H’) (fig.07A,B) followed a 

similar pattern of distribution among the sites, however, in Itapissuma, Paripe and Jaboatão this 

trend wasn’t maintained when sieves were considered and in Itapissuma, Timbó, Paratibe and 

Pina Basin1, when compared the layers (0-10cm and 0-20cm). High values of diversity and 

evenness were found in Ariquindá (sieve:1.0mm; depth:0-20cm) and Itapissuma (combined 

sieves; 0-20cm) and, the minima, in Paratibe (sieve:1.0mm; depth:0-10cm) and Pina Basin2 

(combined sieves; 0-10cm), respectively, which corresponded to about three times less than 

those recorded for the former.  

As might be expected, richness increased down to the 0.5mm mesh, but remained 

invariable in Capibaribe (fig.07C). Since no major changes were reported in macrofaunal 

numbers regarding the sampling depth, its effect had little influence in these univariate indices, 

especially richness.

I.3.4. Macrobenthic community pattern: sieve mesh x sampling depth 

The overall retention efficiency showed that differences between 1.0mm and combined 

sieves are hardly evident for biomass but they are very important for the abundance. The 

1.0mm sieve retained only 28% of total individuals but, at the same time, was responsible for 

92% of total biomass. Among the sites, retention of 1.0mm varied from 10.69% in Pina Basin1 

to 39.98% in Paratibe for abundance and from 33.35% in Paripe to 99.72% in Ariquindá for 

biomass (fig. 08). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 08. Percentages of abundance and biomass considering the 1.0mm sieve’s retention in the 
studied areas.  

  

High retention efficiency in 1.0mm sieve was recorded for crustaceans (&gt;87%) and 

mollusks (&gt;60%); on the contrary, retention was relatively low for polychaetes (35%); 

oligochaetes (24.75%), nemertines (41.38%), sipunculans (45.71%) and phoronides (16.67%) 

(fig.09). 

 Regarding sampling depth, the top layer (0-10cm) presented almost all individuals 

(94%); however, contributed with only 39.06% of the overall biomass. Among sites, except for 

Mamucabas, this layer comprised more than 92% of the abundance in each area whereas 

biomass values in 0-10cm ranged from 6.04% in Timbó to 97.69% in Maracaípe (fig. 10). 

 The bottom layer (10-20cm) showed to be important in the biomass values of mollusks 

(79.67%), sipunculans (86.76%) and phoronides (65.91%). Conversely, crustaceans, 

chironomids, small flatworms and the majority of nematodes (97%) were found in the first ten-

centimeter layer (fig.11).

Although significant interaction between sites and sieves have been revealed by the 

two-way ANOVA for Hill’s index N1 (F1;13=5.17; p=0.02), with the exception of Itapissuma, the 

diversity of macrofauna retained in 1.0mm did not differ when compared to combined sieves 

(LSD test between sieves for each site, tab. 03).  

Following diversity, similarity analysis (two-way ANOSIM) pointed out differences for 

community between the sieves (Rglobal= 0.142; p=0.002) and among sites (Rglobal= 0.654; 

p=0.001), well-represented in MDS (fig.12). Conversely, within the sites, it was observed that 

the use of 0.5mm brought no significant alteration for communities’ structure in most sites, 

excluding Paratibe (Rglobal= 0.456; p=0.024) and Sta Cruz Channel (Rglobal= 0.664; p=0.008). In 

Paratibe, SIMPER analysis (tab.04) demonstrated that differences between sieves were due to 

the polychaetes Laeonereis sp, Capitella sp and Neanthes sp; oligochaetes Tubificidae; 

nematodes and the crustacean Uca sp; whilst in Sta Cruz Channel, apart from nematodes, the 

main taxa which contributed to distinguish the fauna retained in the sieves were the polychaetes 

Exogone sp, Podarke sp and Sigambra sp; the oligochaete Tectidrilus sp and the bivalve 

Corbula sp.

 No significant difference was observed for diversity values (N1) regarding the sampling 

depth for the studied areas (F1;13=0.068; p&gt;0.05). The same pattern was observed for the whole 

community, according to two-way ANOSIM (Rglobal= -0.188; p&gt;0.05) and MDS plot (fig.13) 

results. The analysis also indicated that the sites became more distinct for the factor “sampling 

depth” (Rglobal= 0.743; p=0.001) when compared to “sieves” (Rglobal= 0.654; p=0.001) for 

abundance, being the opposite for biomass (“sampling depth” Rglobal= 0.367; p=0.005; “sieves” 

Rglobal= 0.935; p=0.001). Due to the low number of variables (major taxonomic groups) used to 

construct the similarity matrices, the results for biomass have not separated the individual sites 

for each factor. 

 The factor “sieves” was the only which showed significant differences for the 

macrobenthic community and Pearson’s correlation between the average dissimilarity from each 

site and the subset of environmental variables have selected the total-N (r=0.860; p&lt;0.0001), 

organic matter (r=0.801; p&lt;0.001) and microphytobenthos (r=0.749; p=0.005 and r=0.795; 

p=0.002, for chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments, respectively) as the most fit for explaining the 

“changes” in fauna from 1.0mm to combined sieves.

I.4. Discussion 

 In this study, different procedures for describing spatial structure patterns of tropical 

estuarine macrobenthos were tested and revealed that biological material processed with 

different mesh sizes and sampling depths can influence estimates of parameters from these 

communities. Indeed, the use of 1.0mm or 0.5mm mesh had a more significant effect on 

distribution rather than composition of taxa. In both sieves, macrobenthic communities from the 

studied areas were numerically dominated by annelids – particularly polychaetes – which is 

commonly the more abundant and important taxon in tropical and subtropical estuarine 

macrofauna, as reported by several authors (Maurer and Vargas, 1984; Alongi, 1990; Frouin, 

2000; Dittmann, 2001; Paiva, 2001; Ingole et al., 2002; Lancelloti and Sotz, 2004; Bigot et al., 

2006; Jayaraj et al., 2008). Besides, the presence of the polychaetes Streblospio sp., 

Laeonereis sp., Capitella sp. and Mediomastus sp. together with Tubificidae oligochaetes and 

nematodes were shown to be typical of estuarine environments in Brazilian estuaries (e.g. 

Bemvenuti et al., 2003; Nalesso et al., 2005; Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006; Rosa-Filho et al., 

2006; Barros et al., 2008). 

 Conversely, biomass data showed that Mollusca dominated the communities’ 

composition. Biomass values derived from both sieve fractions within sites were similar, but the 

occurrence of deep burrowing adults of Macoma sp., Lucina sp. and Anomalocardia brasiliana 

in the 10-20cm stratum made important the differences between the sampling depths in some 

areas. Moreover, these species not only represented together less than 1% of total abundance 

(30 individuals), but they also accounted for over than 60% of total biomass, which indicated 

that macrofauna was clearly dominated in numbers by small specimens.  

 Some studies have shown that, for comparison of communities with univariate indices, 

differences in species richness and diversity can be found between samples processed with 

1.0mm and 0.5mm (Bachelet, 1990; Tanaka and Leite, 1998). In Pernambuco estuaries, the 

1.0mm mesh retained more than 70% of species richness and 63% of diversity values, 

indicating that this is not a general trend. Besides, other authors suggest that the mesh size 

used would not interfere, as both sieves would sample similarly in terms of species composition 

(James et al., 1995; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996b).  

 Considering the mesh efficiencies for macrobenthos sampling, the extra information 

added by sieving with both mesh sizes (1.0+0.5mm) had importance only for total abundance. 

Retention efficiency had been reported for 1.0mm sieve when compared to abundances 

retained by the combination of sieves (tab.05) and will diverge depending on the geographic 

area, habitat and benthic assemblage sampled.  

 Regardless of study area or benthic samples, comparative surveys on retention 

efficiency indicate that crustaceans, polychaetes and bivalves usually show decreasing 

selection, in this order, for the same mesh sieve (Bachelet, 1990; Tanaka and Leite, 1998; 

Lampadariou et al., 2005). In this study, while the few crustaceans present (&lt;10 individuals)

more retained in this sieve rather than polychaetes, following a different order of selection 

(crustaceans&gt;bivalves&gt;polychaetes). Such results are in accordance with those from Rodrigues 

et al. (2007) for Tagus estuary (Portugal), where high abundance of Streblospio shrubsolii was 

responsible for polychaetes’ lower retention in 1.0mm sieve. In the present study, the same 

occurred due to the species of Streblospio sp., Capitella sp., Mediomastus sp. and juveniles of 

Laeonereis sp.

 Even though significance has been established for mesh sieves and sites in relation to 

diversity N1 and overall community structure, no important alteration was observed in 

macrobenthic samples for most sites, which meant that in these areas the great contribution of 

the 0.5mm was only in the addition of more specimens rather than more species. Other 

observations seem to corroborate the above findings (e.g. James et al., 1995; Schlacher and 

Wooldridge, 1996b; Gage et al., 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2007). In some cases, given that 

relatively higher costs are associated with finer screens, sampling protocols employing 1.0mm 

sieves can be more cost-effective for characterizing the macrobenthic community (Ferraro et al. 

1994, 2006). 

 On the other hand, the macrobenthic communities were mainly composed by smaller 

and pollution indicator species, thus it is possible that losses of information necessary to detect 

impacts in pollution assessment would occur if 1.0mm sieve was used instead of a 0.5mm. 

Considering that most sites presented evidence of disturbance (from different sources, see 



 
 
 

35

description of studied areas in the Material and Methods section), and that the sediment 

parameters (organic matter, total-N and microphytobenthos biomass) selected in the correlation 

analyses are frequently associated to organic enrichment conditions, it becomes fundamental 

using the material retained in the 0.5mm sieve in studies focusing this theme. 

 Concerning the sampling depth, the importance of the upper centimeter layers for the 

taxa composition and abundance structure of benthic communities is widely reported (Weston, 

1990; Flach and Heip, 1996; Dauwe et al., 1998; Flach et al., 1998; Ingole et al., 1999; Wei, 

2006). In fact, over 90% of the macrofauna specimens and taxa were presented in top layer (0-

10cm). Flach and Heip (1996) and Flach et al. (1998) showed that in deep-sea areas of NE 

Atlantic, macrobenthic fauna concentrated in the first centimeter (40-80% and 25-59%, 

respectively); Gutiérrez et al (2000) observed in the continental shelf of Central Chile that 40-

80% of macrofauna was in 0-2cm stratum while 20-40%, in 2-5cm. In estuaries, the proportion 

can be even higher: Mannino and Montagna (1997) pointed out in Nueces estuary (USA) that 

more than 70% of total abundance was in the 0-5cm stratum while Rodrigues et al. (2007) 

registered 87% in Tagus estuary (Portugal).  

 A different pattern was shown in the vertical profile for total biomass, which presented 

variations in terms of distribution within the sediment strata among areas. In five sites, highest 

biomass values (63 to 94%) were found bellow the first 10cm, as a result of large deep-dwelling 

bivalves, sipunculans and phoronides. In these areas, sampling only the upper centimeters of 

sediment would have missed many large deep-burrowing species that are few in number, but 

account for most of the total biomass. Weston (1990) demonstrated the same dilemma: 90% of 

the macrofauna individuals were found in the 0 to 5cm stratum, but 40 to 90% of the biomass 

was situated in 5-20cm. 

 The importance of estimation total macrobenthic biomass must be taken into account 

for pollution-monitoring programmes since most methods for detecting anthropogenic stress 

include those centered on the primary community structural variables (abundance, species 

richness and biomass) and its derivation, such as diversity indices, abundance (A/S) and 

biomass (B/A) ratios (Elliot and Quintino, 2007).  Warwick (1986) had suggested that the 

relation between species abundance and species biomass curves can show pollution-induced 

condition, known as Abundance-Biomass-Comparisons (or ABC curves). According to Dauer 

(1993), healthy benthic communities can be characterized by high biomass estimates, 

dominated by long-lived, often deep-dwelling (e.g. bivalve mollusks, Maldanidae polychaetes, 

etc.) species and this might indicate a past history of good water/sediment quality situations. 

Recently, Lampadariou et al. (2008) proposed the size fraction of macrofaunal biomass 

(Biomass Fractionation Index – BFI) as a monitoring tool to discriminate between impacted and 

unimpacted sites. This index has advantage in relation to the above metrics since it 

incorporated measures of total macrofaunal biomass rather than biomass of specific (i.e. 

sensitive or non-sensitive to disturbance) taxa/groups, although further studies are still 

necessary.

 Macrofauna descriptors (diversity and community structure) identified for total fauna (0-

20cm) were similar to those obtained with the analyses (ANOVA, ANOSIM and MDS) based 

only on the top layer (0-10cm). These results support the importance of top layer for the taxa 

composition and abundance structure of the benthic community, however, for studies based on 

biomass, the inclusion of the bottom layer seems to be essential (Rodrigues et al., 2007).  

 The soft-bottom macrobenthic communities investigated in this study showed that even 

if sampling with a 1.0mm mesh appears to be adequate to describe biota’s composition (based 

on some sort of cost-benefit analysis), in these estuaries - where macrofauna is mostly 

composed by small specimens - the use of the 0.5mm sieve will permit a more accurate 

interpretation of the data. In addition, for taxa composition and abundance, the top layer is 

clearly the most important whereas for biomass the bottom layer should be considered. 

 
 

I.5. Conclusion 

 The requirement for adequate description of benthic communities attributes 

(abundance, biomass, diversity) has serious implications in making a reasonable assessment of 

environmental impacts and, consequently, in monitoring programmes. Although the present 

study is based on a single sampling period and spatially limited, the results shows the influence 

of both mesh-sieve and sampling depth in characterizing the tropical estuarine macrofauna. It 

must be highlighted that the investigator needs to decide which and how many response 

measures will be taken in order to achieve a particular objective. No single protocol will perform 

optimally for all geographic areas, habitat types and communities, thus, considerable attention 

should be devoted to methodological planning, including the criteria of choosing a particular 

sieve or sampling depth as for obtaining better accurate information on ecological interpretation 

of biota and ecosystems.

CHAPTER II. Macrobenthic communities in estuarine health assessment on 
tropical areas (Northeast, Brazil): applying the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). 
 

II.1. Introduction 

 Estuarine and coastal environments are known by their importance in terms of 

complexity and biodiversity; however, human activities (pollution, tourism, commercial fisheries, 

eutrophication, sediment discharges, sand extraction and marine transport) have been affecting, 

directly or indirectly, the biodiversity of these ecosystems on a worldwide-scale (Dauer et al., 

2000; Ellingsen, 2001; Kimerer, 2002; Andersen et al., 2006; Borja, 2006; Borja and Dauer, 

2008).  

 The study of marine benthic communities allows the assessment of environmental 

health of marine and coastal areas (Muniz et al., 2005). Macrobenthic infauna has a 

fundamental role on sediment processes, providing an important measure of the response of a 

community to environmental perturbations (Warwick, 1986; Engle et al., 1994; Baldó et al., 

1999; Frouin, 2000; Ysebaert and Herman, 2002; Figueroa et al., 2003) and exhibiting the 

greatest potential for monitoring conditions in a site (Pagola-Carte et al., 2002). Given its 

inherent ability of incorporating sediment quality (MacFarlane and Booth, 2001; Quintino et al., 

2006), a growing number of tools and methods relies on macrobenthic attributes such as 

species composition, abundance (Labrune et al., 2006), biomass (Lampadariou et al., 2008) 

and ecological function (Pearson, 2001).  

 Within this context, biotic indices are very useful tools in decision-making processes 

(Pinto et al., 2009) since they synthesize complex scientific data into the most straightforward 

and easy interpretation (Labrune et al., 2006; Chainho et al., 2007; Pontil et al., 2007). One of 

them, AZTI Marine Biotic Index – AMBI, developed by Borja et al., (2000), is based upon the 

proportion of species gathered into sensitivity groups to increasing levels of disturbance, from 

very sensitive to opportunistic (Borja et al., 2008). Although this index was designed to assess 

the ecological quality of European water ecosystems, its applicability has extended to other 

geographic areas as Asia (Cai et al., 2003), northern Africa (Bazairi et al., 2005; Bakalem et al., 

2009), North America (Borja et al., 2008), South America (Muniz et al., 2005) and southwest 

Indian Ocean (Bigot et al., 2008), allowing correct evaluation of the ecosystem’s conditions. 

 The use of biotic indices presents limitations, mainly inside coastal and estuarine 

ecosystems of tropical and subtropical areas, where basic information regarding ecological 

characteristic of soft-bottom macrobenthic communities is still scarce (Frouin, 2000; Gray, 2002; 

Muniz et al., 2005; Bigot et al., 2008). The ecology of soft-bottom benthic macrofauna 

communities in estuarine systems on the Atlantic coast of South America is recent and without 

previous data or long-term monitoring programs (Pagliosa and Barbosa, 2006). Besides, they 

have been thoroughly concentrated in the south and southeast coasts (subtropical and 

temperate areas), where the impacts on estuarine systems only have been registered in 



 
 
 

44

obvious cases of severe pollution (Venturini et al., 2004), so extensive gaps in the north and 

northeast regions remain (Couto et al., 2003). 

In Pernambuco State, northeast coast of Brazil, estuarine zones are the most affected 

by anthropogenic influences (e.g. sewage, removal of native mangrove forests for sugar-cane 

monocropping, industries such as chlor-alkali, fertilizers, agricultural defensives, paper mills, 

aluminum, and others) (CPRH, 2006). As a consequence, it is necessary to propose 

instruments and methodologies which permit to express the structural and functional quality of 

the benthic communities in order to achieve sustainability and conservation of these tropical 

ecosystems. 

 The present study aimed to examine the AMBI efficiency to evaluate with adequacy and 

accuracy the environmental and ecological status of the estuarine ecosystems of Pernambuco 

in view of extending its use to other tropical areas.  The comparison between urbanized and 

relatively conserved areas may allow recognizing the ecological performance of AMBI in 

estuaries with non-intense levels of pollution or where there is a lack of historical data. This 

work also assessed among environmental variables those which best reflect the responses of 

macrobenthic communities to anthropogenic stressors and tested the AMBI index classification 

dependence on sieve-mesh (1.0mm and 0.5mm) and sampling depth (0-10cm and 0-20cm).  

 
 

II.2. Material and Methods  

II.2.1. Studied areas and sampling design 

 The same fourteen sites presented in Chapter 01 (see pages 17 and 18) were selected in 

order to evaluate their ecological condition and integrity. Although most of these estuaries are 

defined as Environmental Protection Areas (through the State Law n.9.931, December 1986; 

Noronha, 2008), they are subjected to different sources (tab.01), as shown by monitoring 

reports (CPRH, 2006).  

The sampling procedure, number of replicates collected for environmental variables, 

microphytobenthos and macrofauna as well as the methods applied for abiotic parameters 

analyses followed the descriptions in Chapter 01 (see tab.02 and 03). Granulometric 

composition was determined according to Wentworth scale (1922): coarse sand (0.5mm); 

medium sand (0.25mm); fine sand (0.125mm); very fine sand (0.062mm) and mud (&lt;0.062mm).  

For macrofauna, the total abundance per replicate was used to examine AMBI 

efficiency; afterwards, abundance was separated by sieve-mesh (1.0mm and 1.0+0.5mm or 

combined sieves) and sampling depth (0-10cm and 0-20cm) to test the contribution of these 

factors for the index diagnosis.

 The ecological quality status of the sites was determined using the AMBI index (Grall 

and Grémarec, 1997; Borja et al., 2000). This index relies on the distribution of individual 

abundances of the soft-bottom communities into five ecological groups (EG) according to a 

gradient of pollution: Ecological group I (EGI) - Species very sensitive to organic enrichment and 

present under unpolluted conditions; Ecological group II (EGII) - Species indifferent to 

enrichment, always present in low densities with non-significant variations with time; Ecological 

group III (EGIII) - Species tolerant to excess organic matter enrichment. Populations stimulated 

by slight unbalanced situations; Ecological group IV (EGIV) - Second-order opportunistic species 

(slight to pronounced unbalanced situations); Ecological group V (EGV) - First-order 

opportunistic species (pronounced unbalanced situations). 

 AMBI values (also referred as biotic coefficient or BC) are computed as the sum of 

products of the proportion of each ecological group by an arbitrary value (0; 1.5; 3; 4.5; 6) 

attributed to each EG (Bigot et al., 2008) and vary continuously from 0 (undisturbed) to 6 

(extremely disturbed)(tab. 04): 

 

 
 In the present study, AMBI was computed for each individual replicate and then 

averaged for each site as recommended by Borja et al. (2003), Borja and Muxika (2005a), 

Muniz et al. (2005) and Bigot et al. (2008). The assignment of the identified species into one of 

the five ecological groups proposed by the index was based upon the list available in the AMBI 

v.4.0 program (http://www.azti.es). Species not considered in the list or for which the 

classification was not in accordance with knowledge on their ecological distribution for tropical 

areas were assigned or re-assigned to an EG based on pollution condition monitoring reports of 

Pernambuco estuaries (CPRH, 2006), on literature about local ecological characteristics of 

AMBI = 1/100 x (0 x %EGI + 1.5 x %EGII + 3 x %EGIII + 4.5 x %EGIV + 6 x %EGV)

II.2.2. Data analysis 

For this study, the following main faunal parameters which could contribute to qualify 

the ecological status of the sites are presented: species richness (S), evenness (J’) and AMBI 

index, the last one computed using the AMBI program (v.4.0). The first two indices results were 

described in chapter 01. In order to assess whether species were properly classified and 

propose new ecological assignments, before calculating AMBI, the sites were gathered into 

groups considering previous information on their pollution condition (CPRH, 2006) and 

environmental parameters. The groups of sites resulting from these associations were 

characterized by their indicator species, through the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient, 

developed by Dufrêne and Legendre (1997). According to the authors, a species is indicator of 

a group if it occurs on most of the samples from this group (specificity) and if it is poorly 

represented on the other groups (fidelity). The IndVal coefficient combines both the species 

relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the defined groups of sites. The 

statistical significance of the species indicator values was estimated using a random reallocation 

procedure (1000 randomizations) of sites among site groups, through the Monte Carlo test, thus 

a species is considered as a group indicator if the results are significant to a level of 0.05 

(Zintzen et al., 2008). In general, groups are defined by categorical environmental parameters, 

disturbance levels, experimental treatments or types of habitat (Wetzel et al., 2002). In this 

study, categorical dissolved oxygen and disturbance levels were adopted, separating the sites 

into two groups: (1) undisturbed or low disturbance conditions, where dissolved oxygen values 

were superior to 5.0mg/L (reference concentration for Brazilian’s estuarine waters, according to 

CONAMA Resolution n.357/2005) and (2) medium to high disturbance conditions, where 

dissolved oxygen values were lower than 5.0mg/L. The IndVal coefficient was calculated using 

the PC-ORD v.4.0 Windows program (McCune and Mefford, 1999). 



 
 
 

48

On the basis of the macrofaunal parameters (AMBI index, S and J’), Multidimensional 

scaling (MDS) and Analysis of Similarity (one-way ANOSIM) were used to point out differences 

among sites in view of the ecological quality of macrobenthic community (see AMBI 

classification of benthic community health, tab.04). Simultaneously, the BEST/BIOENV routine 

was performed to associate environmental variables to the set of indices (AMBI, species 

richness and evenness), while Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was carried out in order 

to determine correlations between each index and the abiotic variables. To account for multiple 

simultaneous Spearman’s rank correlations, Bonferroni correction was applied and results were 

significant at p&lt;0.0045. The multivariate analyses (MDS, ANOSIM and BEST/BIOENV) were 

performed with PRIMER v6.0 software (Clarke and Gorley, 2006) and Spearman’s correlation 

coefficient was calculated using the BIOESTAT v5.0 program (Ayres et al., 2007). 

Finally, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used to compare results from AMBI 

classification of estuarine systems considering the factors “mesh-sieve” and “sampling depth”. 

In this case, the significance level adopted was 0.025, after Bonferroni correction. In addition, a 

two-tailed t-test was applied to verify the relation between index values found (for mesh-sieve 

and sampling depth factors) and the presence or absence of urbanization around these 

estuaries. The Wilcoxon test was performed using the STATISTICA v5.0 software and the t-test 

was calculated with the BIOESTAT v5.0 program (Ayres et al., 2007). 

All (but not Wilcoxon or Spearman’s rank correlation) statistics statements were based on 

a significance level of ? = 5%.

II.3. Results  

II.3.1. Environmental data 

Water parameters: Mean temperature ranged from 25.7 (in Mamucabas) to 30.5°C (in 

Maracaípe) with little variation between seasons (fig. 01). As for salinity, mean values were akin 

to those obtained in the period of macrofauna samplings (October-2007). In most sites, 

dissolved oxygen levels were found to be outside the normal limits for estuarine systems 

(tab.05); on the other hand, only Pina Basin1 (3.997?mol/L), Jaboatão (6.311?mol/L) and 

Paratibe (7.292?mol/L) presented ammonia-N concentrations (fig.02) higher than the reference 

value (3.89?mol/L) established by Brazilian laws. Significant correlations were registered 

between salinity values in October-2007 and both mean temperature (r=0.752; p=0.002) and 

dissolved oxygen (r=0.716; p=0.004) averaged along the seasons.

Sedimentological parameters: The granulometric composition showed that the sediment at the 

sampling areas is mainly composed by sand fractions, especially medium sand (in Paratibe, 

Itapissuma, Mamucabas and Maracaípe) and fine sand (in Pina Basin1, Jaboatão, Pirapama, 



 
 
 

51

Paripe and Sta Cruz Channel). The very fine sand fraction dominated in Timbó, Ariquindá and 

Ipojuca-Merepe and the two formers presented high proportion of mud (or silt-clay) fraction. In 

contrast, Capibaribe and Pina Basin2 sediments were represented by coarse sand (fig.03). In 

these sites, surface sediment was characterized by yellow-brown color (probably diatoms) and 

green (cyanobacteria) color compact mats that might have interfered during the granulometric 

analyses. The algal mats also might contribute to the high chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments 

concentrations observed (fig.04). 

Sediment presented strongly reduced conditions along sites and the redox potential (Eh) in the 

bottom layer (~20cm) was generally more negative than in the surface (~2cm) (fig.05). 

A strong correlation between the organic matter content (fig.06) and total-N (fig.07) variables 

(r=0.911; p&lt;0.001) in the sediments was registered.

II.3.2. Ecological group assignments and sites classification 

Among all macrofauna taxa, over 30% were not listed in any ecological group (EG) of 

AZTI database, being the majority (79%) ascribed an EG based on the classification for the 

same genus. For the following species, ecological groups were attributed according to AZTI list 

for higher taxonomic levels (&gt;Family): Anomalocardia brasiliana (I), Barantolla sp. (V), 

Capitellides sp. (V), Fabrisabella sp. (I), Neomediomastus sp. (V), Pseudobranchiomma sp. (I) 

and Timarete sp. (IV). Due to the lack of ecological information for tropical regions, eighteen 

taxa still remained without classification, known as not assigned. 

 Considering the definition of sites into groups using the variables dissolved oxygen and 

disturbance levels, the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient revealed the presence of four 



 
 
 

54

significant indicator species (tab. 06). In terms of ecological interpretation, since these species 

presented high indicator values (&gt;50%), they were associated to sensitive and opportunistic 

groups of AMBI (EG I and V, respectively). Consequently, Magelona sp., Megalomma sp. and 

Sternaspis sp. were reclassified to EG (I) and Streblospio sp., to EG (V).    

 
Table 06. Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient for significant species related to the categorical 
groups. Groups: (1) sites undisturbed or low disturbance conditions (dissolved oxygen 
concentration &gt;5.0mg/L) and (2) sites disturbed (dissolved oxygen concentration&amp;lt;5.0mg/L).

1 Megalomma sp. 51.3 4.1 

1 Sternaspis sp. 60.0 2.3 

2 Streblospio sp. 89.1 2.8 

 
Although Oligochaeta was not selected as an indicator species by the IndVal coefficient, 

this study suggests its change from ecological group V (first-order opportunistic) to III (tolerant), 

in view of the fact that most oligochaetes identified belong to Tubificidae which can be observed 

not only in impacted sites but also at low salinity unimpacted sites within estuaries (see Paul et 

al., 2001; Pinto et al., 2009). 

The final list, including new ecological group assignments and re-assignments, is given

 The AMBI values showed that all estuaries presented some level of disturbance, 
ranging from 2.395 (slightly disturbed, in Ariquindá) to 5.236 (heavily disturbed, in Capibaribe). 



 
 
 

57

According to the index, most sites were situated between the slightly-moderate disturbed 

boundaries, due to the higher proportion of Nematoda and Oligochaeta (including Tubificidae 

species), both them assigned here as ecological group III (60-80%). The mean percentage of 

each ecological group and AMBI score per site are given in figures 08 and 09, respectively.

Although classified as slightly disturbed, Ariquindá exhibited the major abundance of 

sensitive species (21.8%), composed by Lucina sp., Magelona sp., Megalomma sp., Scoloplos 

sp. and Sternaspis sp. In Capibaribe, on the other hand, numerical dominance of opportunistic 

species Capitella sp., Capitellides sp. and Streblospio sp., which accounted for 78.6% of total 

abundance, was associated to the heavily disturbed classification (fig.09).

In terms of benthic community health, the estuarine areas of Pernambuco were 

classified as unbalanced (for Pirapama, Sta Cruz Channel, Paripe, Ariquindá and Maracaípe), 

transitional to pollution (for Pina Basin1, Timbó, Jaboatão, Itapissuma, Mamucabas and Ipojuca-

Merepe), polluted (for Pina Basin2 and Paratibe) and transitional to heavy pollution (for 

Capibaribe).  

The ordination diagram (MDS) and cluster analyses applied to AMBI, richness (S) and 

evenness (J’) showed the presence of two distinct groups following the ecological quality of 

benthic community (fig.10 and 11) proposed by the index (tab.04): Group (A) includes sites 

where macrobenthos was classified as polluted/transitional to heavy pollution, whereas Group 

(B) involves sites with the benthic fauna considered as unbalanced/transitional to pollution. 

Significant differences were established among the sites in relation to benthic community health 

(Rglobal=0.363; p=0.001) but not within the two groups (tab. 08).

BIO-ENV routine discriminated the variables ammonia-N, dissolved oxygen and organic 

matter (rs=0.376) or ammonia-N, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a (rs=0.451) when excluding 

Ipojuca-Merepe and Maracaípe sites (since microphytobenthos was lost for these estuaries) as 

the environmental factors best related to the similarity matrix based on the suite of indices 

(AMBI, species richness and evenness). Individually, significant correlations were observed for 

AMBI and ammonia-N (rs=0.714; p=0.004) and between evenness (J’) and grain sorting 

(rs=0.749; p=0.002). 

 

 

II.3.3. AMBI comparative approach: mesh size and sampling depth x urbanization   

 A comparison of the index results for factors “mesh-sieve” and “sampling depth” in sites’ 

final score suggested the influence of the sieves in AMBI classification, with significant 

differences found between 1.0mm and combined sieves (1+0.5mm) in 0-10cm (p=0.0003) and 

in 0-20cm (p=0.00029) sampling depths. Using the 1.0mm sieve alone, mean AMBI ranged 

between a minimum of 2.134 and a maximum of 6.000, both in the 0-10cm. In the combined 

sieves, the values were 2.368 and 5.377, respectively, also in the first ten-centimeter layer. The 

classification differences observed for sieves were perceived in three sites: Pina Basin2 (in 0-

20cm), Pirapama (in 0-10cm) and Sta Cruz Channel (in both layers) (tab.09).

Although significant differences were noticeable between 0-10cm and 0-20cm for 

combined sieves (p=0.0024), most areas presented no changes in the final condition 

assessment concerning the sampling depth. In Pirapama, the given classification of “Moderately 

disturbed” in 1.0mm/0-10cm for “Slightly disturbed” in both combined/0-10cm and 1.0mm/0-

20cm seemed to be more related to the sieve effect (1.0mm x combined sieves) rather than the 

depth (0-10cm x 0-20cm). On the other hand, in Pina Basin2, both sieves and total depth (0-

20cm) contributed to classify the site’s environmental status, with AMBI values varying from 

4.876 (“Moderately disturbed”) to 6.000 (“Heavily disturbed”). From an overall perspective, 

better system conditions were achieved using the combined sieves (1.0+0.5mm) and total layer 

(0-20cm) (tab. 09), except for Mamucabas, where the lowest score was the same for 1.0mm 

and combined sieves, in 0-20cm. 

The ecological quality of sites (given by mean AMBI values for combined sieves/0-

20cm) was found to be significantly different in urbanized versus conserved areas (two-tailed t-

test; p=0.016); however, when evaluating the urbanization effects on these environments using 

data from 1.0mm/0-10cm, AMBI did not differ significantly (p&lt;0.05).

II.4. Discussion 

 The development of biotic indices for assessing the ecological integrity of benthic 

communities in estuaries and coastal areas has progressed in recent years (Engle et al., 1994; 

Nilsson and Rosenberg, 1997; Weisberg et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 1998; Engle and Summers, 

1999; Borja et al., 2000; Paul et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001; Simboura and Zenetos, 2002; 

Paul, 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2004; Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007; Muxika et al., 2007; Hale and 

Heltshe, 2008). Although new indices are continuously being created (Diaz et al., 2004), a 

general consensus has been emphasized on assessing the suitability of indices that already 

exist (Borja et al., 2008) in order to improve their performance in different environments. 

 In this context, AMBI was chosen among other available indices due to its wide 

applicability within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in relation to the use of 

macrobenthos as a source of information regarding marine environment quality (Borja et al., 

2000; Marín-Guirao et al., 2005; Muxika et al., 2005; Reiss and Kroncke, 2005; Carvalho et al., 

2006; Labrune et al., 2006; Dauvin et al., 2007; Simboura and Reizopoulou, 2007; Zettler et al., 

2007; Bigot et al., 2008). Since this index is based on relative proportion of sensitive/tolerant 

taxa, the assignment of dominant species into one of the five ecological groups (EG) constitutes 

a prerequisite for adequate evaluation of the ecosystems, as described by Bigot et al. (2008). 

However, appropriate assignments are neither necessarily available (Muniz et al., 2005; Flaten 

et al., 2007) nor easy to achieve outside European coasts, where AMBI was developed (Borja et 

al., 2000; Bigot et al., 2008). In the present study, the overall pattern of ecological quality status 

in the sites would be different depending on the assignment of selected species/taxa (see 

tab.07). For instance, if these taxa were submitted to AZTI database without modifications of its 

ecological group, the number of sites classified as “Heavily disturbed” would increased from one 

(Capibaribe) to five (Capibaribe, Paratibe, Jaboatão, Mamucabas and Ipojuca-Merepe), 

besides, Pirapama, Sta Cruz Channel, Paripe and Ariquindá should be considered as 

“Moderately disturbed” instead of “Slightly disturbed”. Other surveys also highlighted the 

necessity of checking the assignment of dominant species to prevent contradictory results from 

the AMBI as the classification of a certain area may diverge when allocating species to an 

unsuitable group (Salas et al., 2004; Marín-Guirao et al., 2005; Muniz et al., 2005; Labrune et 

al., 2006; Albayrak et al., 2006; Bigot et al., 2008). 

 Another important observation concerning the contributions mentioned above is that 

new ecological group assignments and re-assignments are attributed in relation to previous data 

from monitoring programs or author experience on ecological characteristics of faunal 

communities in the studied ecosystems. According to Salas et al. (2004) this implies on an 

important exercise of subjectivity and leads to impossibility of establishing fixed reference 

values. The use of a simple method as the Indicator Value (IndVal) coefficient permits that 

reviews of assignments of particular taxa to an ecological group might be made in a more 

objective form and less dependent on the historical information, especially in areas where the 

knowledge on ecological and environmental characteristics is restricted or unavailable. In this 



 
 
 

62

study, despite the limited number of studied sites, significant Indicator Values enabled the 

objective re-assignments of two important species, Sternaspis sp. and Streblospio sp. 

 In general, from the results of this study, the AMBI index worked satisfactorily in 

disturbance detection, especially in urbanized estuaries, with recognized pollution condition, as 

showed by monitoring reports (CPRH, 2006). This index was also sufficiently robust to 

discriminate spatio-temporal effects of organic enrichment in Botafogo and Sirigi, two estuarine 

systems of north coast of Pernambuco subjected to different sources of pollution (probably 

aquaculture and sugar cane activities, respectively), as outlined by Valença (2007). 

Nevertheless, some inconsistencies were found in the classification of estuaries placed far from 

urban centers and with some level of preservation as Mamucabas, Paripe, Ariquindá and 

Maracaípe. Previous studies already indicated that most of Biotic Indices displayed limitations in 

ecosystems with low salinity habitats (Borja and Muxika, 2005a; Muxika et al., 2007) or where 

sediment organic matter is naturally high (Borja et al., 2003; Salas et al., 2004; Muxika et al., 

2005; Albayrak et al., 2006; Lavesque et al., 2009), as the case of tropical estuaries. The 

species adapted to these habitats typically occur in high numbers and are listed as tolerant or 

opportunistic (Borja et al., 2000; Dauvin, 2007; Elliot and Quintino, 2007; Simboura and 

Reizopoulou, 2008). In these sites, macrofauna was dominated by Tubificidae oligochaetes 

(including Tectidrilus sp.) and Nematoda, both taxa assigned here as ecological group III 

(tolerant species). A similar situation was reported by Blanchet et al. (2008), during the 

assessment of three French Atlantic coastal areas (Arcachon Bay, Marennes-Oléron Bay and 

the Seine estuary). These authors observed that some sites, considered healthy and well 

vegetated (see Blanchet et al., 2004) were classified in moderate or worse status due to the 

numerical abundance of tolerant and opportunistic species. In the mentioned cases, Borja and 

Muxika (2005b) recommend the use of AMBI together with other metrics, in order to obtain a 

more comprehensive view of the environmental condition. 

 Indeed, a combination of AMBI, richness (S) and evenness (J’) seemed to be the best 

approach in comparison to the index individually, although the three indices together could 

distinguish the sites in terms of benthic community health (as demonstrated by MDS and 

ANOSIM analyses) in relation to disturbance levels. These indices are known as measures of 

biotic integrity of macrobenthic community structure and underline species identity and diversity, 

which are thought to be intrinsically important features of the benthos (Díaz et al., 2003; Borja et 

al., 2008). The results from MDS/ANOSIM suggested that benthic communities are separated 

as a function of ecological quality, being in agreement with the multivariate correlation between 

the indices and environmental parameters, which pointed out variables associated to pollution 

condition, such as ammonia-N, dissolved oxygen, organic matter or chlorophyll-a. On the other 

hand, individual AMBI showed high significant correlation simply with ammonia-N. In general, 

the highest values of AMBI were related to sites with high concentration of ammonia-N, normally 

representative of hypoxic/anoxic environments or urbanized areas submitted to organic 

enrichment such as sewage, wastewater outfalls and agricultural runoffs (Pinckney, 2006). In 

coastal systems, AMBI has been tested against different anthropogenic sources, which includes 



 
 
 

63

anoxia and hypoxia, sediment toxicity (metals, PAH), and others (Borja et al., 2003; Muxika et 

al., 2005), presenting correlation with total organic carbon (TOC), sediment type (including silt-

clay content), dissolved oxygen concentration (Borja et al., 2000; Muniz et al., 2005; Carvalho et 

al., 2006; Borja et al., 2007; Blanchet et al., 2008; Borja et al., 2008; Munari and Mistri, 2008) 

and also organic matter and pigments (chlorophyll-a/phaeopigments) content (Dauvin et al., 

2007). 

 Recently, Dauvin et al. (2007) and Pinto et al. (2009) have tested the effect of mesh-

sieve on the values of several indices, and consequently in its classification. Comparing 

biological samples from Bay of Seine and Seine estuary, sieved with both 2.0mm and 1.0mm, 

Dauvin et al. (2007) showed that AMBI, BQI (Benthic Quality Index; Rosenberg et al., 2004) and 

BOPA (Benthic Opportunistic Polychaeta/Amphipoda Index; Dauvin and Ruellet, 2007) 

exhibited few changes in the scores, being more evident in the last two indices. In Mondego 

estuary, Pinto et al. (2009) compared the performance of BCI (Benthic Condition Index; Engle 

and Summers, 1999), B-IBI (Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity; Weisberg et al., 1997) with the 

proposed P-BAT (Portuguese-Benthic Assessment Tool, an integration of Shannon-Wiener 

index, Margalef index and AMBI) in relation to two meshes sizes (1.0mm and 1+0.5mm) and 

observed that when both sieves were used, the indices exhibited a decrease in environmental 

conditions at the polyhaline sand stations but best conditions in the euhaline estuarine area; 

moreover the combined sieves presented robustness to determine the overall system 

classification. Concerning this study, no pattern was found between AMBI classification and 

salinity, but the use of different sieves (1.0mm x combined meshes) performed a surprising 

result. Once small species associated to organic enrichment usually passe through coarser 

sieves (&gt;1.0mm; Schlacher and Wooldridge, 1996; Thompson et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 

2007), it was expected that the use of 0.5mm could provide a worse pollution condition (e.g. 

Pinto et al., 2009) of the sites. In fact, the combined sieves increased the retention of small 

specimens (mainly Capitellidae polychaetes, Streblospio sp., Tubificidae oligochaetes and 

nematodes) assigned here as ecological groups III and V, but the higher proportion of tolerant 

species in contrast to the opportunistic ones (for both sieves compared to 1.0mm) was 

responsible for the balance of intermediate levels of disturbance, reflecting better system 

conditions in most sites. On the other hand, the sampling depth seemed to have less influence 

on AMBI classification. Despite the fact that differences between 0-10cm and 0-20cm were in 

terms of few individuals, the biotic index account for the abundance and taxa composition and 

thus was susceptible to these parameters, even though it has not affected the overall 

community assessment. Furthermore, the separation of sites considering the location from 

urban centers revealed that pollution condition assessment of urbanized and conserved 

estuaries given by this index is clearly related to both factors – mesh-sieve and sampling depth   

 In summary, AMBI proved to be efficient in evaluating the quality status of Pernambuco 

estuaries, although its applicability requests some adaptations in species’ ecological groups. It 

also demonstrated that the investment in tools as the IndVal coefficient might be essential in 

establishing fixed references for a particular or a group of indicator species, without depending 



 
 
 

64

on prior information on the taxa of the area of study. Moreover, the influence of mesh-sieve and 

sampling depth are visible on benthic indices’ performance considering the effect of 

urbanization in these estuaries. 

 

II.5. Conclusion 

  In order to determine the biological integrity of macrobenthic communities, every 

method must incorporate biotic responses through the evaluation of processes from individuals 

to ecosystems. Therefore, the mutual use of some metrics allows the integration of biological 

features, providing a more accurate diagnosis of the ecosystem’s overall condition. Several 

studies reveal that none of the available indices applied solely should be considered ideal to 

measure biological effects of pollution, because each index was originally developed for one or 

few stressors. Thus, the complementary use of different indices or methods based on different 

ecological principles is highly recommended for the assessment of environmental quality. It is 

suggested that prior to the application of AMBI index, attention must be taken with the pre-

established assignment of an ecological group to each of the sampled species, particularly the 

dominant ones. In addition, the present study emphasizes the need for careful methodological 

procedures, including the choice of an appropriate mesh-sieve or sampling depth in 

characterizing ecological quality of tropical estuarine ecosystems with biotic indices (such as 

AMBI) based on macrobenthos relative abundance and composition.
