Resumo 

No presente trabalho foram investigados vários aspectos relacionados à dinâmica populacional, 
ecologia e pesca do agulhão-vela no Atlântico equatorial e sudoeste. As análises incluíram: (1) 
biologia reprodutiva; (2) modelagem da distribuição de tamanho e captura por unidade de 
esforço (CPUE) em relação aos efeitos ambientais e espaciais; (3) movimentos e utilização do 
habitat determinado por telemetria via-satélite e; (4) análise da CPUE de agulhão-vela capturado 
pela pesca esportiva no Brasil. A proporção sexual de agulhão-vela varia espaço-temporalmente 
na área de estudo e o comprimento de primeira maturação sexual estimado foi 147,21 cm de 
mandíbula inferior até a forquilha (MIF). A fecundidade variou entre 0,44 x 106 ovócitos 
hidratados para uma fêmea de 156 cm MIF e 2,26 x 106 ovócitos hidratados para uma fêmea de 
183 cm LJFL. O Atlântico equatorial oeste não é uma área de desova, enquanto que a costa 
sudeste brasileira, ao contrário, se constitui em uma área de desova importante para a espécie, 
principalmente de dezembro a fevereiro. Altas densidades de adultos também foram observadas 
a oeste de 40°W, em ambas as partes da área de estudo, norte e sul. Por outro lado, uma 
tendência oposta foi observada em relação aos juvenis, que parecem estar associados a águas 
com temperatura da superfície do mar (TSM) superiores a 28°C com uma profundidade da 
camada de mistura mais profunda (&gt; 50m), no lado ocidental, particularmente entre 10° - 20°S e 
25° - 35°W. A modelagem da CPUE revelou uma agregação sazonal elevada ao longo da costa 
sudeste brasileira durante o pico de desova, enquanto que o centro-oeste do Atlântico, ao sul de ~ 
15°S, bem como a costa norte brasileira, podem representar importantes áreas de alimentação 
durante o inverno. Os modelos também revelaram que a TSM e a velocidade do vento foram as 
variáveis mais importantes na variação da CPUE. Os resultados da telemetria via-satélite 
indicaram um claro padrão de utilização do habitat vertical, predominantemente concentrado 
próximo da superfície do mar com uma preferência relativamente estreita de temperatura.  A 
"rota mais provável" sugerem que os agulhões-vela marcados não se deslocaram 
significativamente do local de marcação. Por fim, na presente tese, novos insights sobre a 
estrutura populacional da espécie no Oceano Atlântico foram apresentados e discutidos. Embora 
a separação do estoque do noroeste parece ser clara, ainda há uma grande incerteza sobre o grau 
de mistura entre os estoques do sudoeste e leste. 

Palavras-chave: Agulhão-vela; época de desova, proporção sexual, fecundidade, predição 
espacial, estrutura de tamanho, padronização de CPUE, telemetria via-satélite, Oceano

Abstract 
In the present dissertation it was investigated several aspects related to the population dynamics, 
ecology and fishery of sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic. The analysis 
included: (1) reproductive biology; (2) modeling of size distribution and catch rates in relation to 
environmental and spatial effects; (3) movements and habitat utilization determined by pop-up 
satellite tagging and; (4) catch rates of sailfish caught by spot fishery. Sex ratio of sailfish caught 
in the western equatorial south Atlantic varies temporally and spatially and estimate length at 
first sexual maturity was 147.21 cm Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL). Batch fecundity estimates 
ranged from 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female to 2.26 x 106 hydrated 
oocytes for a 183 cm LJFL female. The western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off Brazilian coast is 
not a spawning ground for sailfish, while the southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be 
an important spawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from 
December to February. High densities of adults were also observed to the west of 40oW, both at 
northern and southern parts of the studied area. An opposite trend was observed in relation to 
juveniles, which appear to be associated with waters with SSTs higher than 28°C and deep 
mixed layer (&gt;50m) in the western side, particularly between 10° - 20°S and 25° - 35°W. Catch 
rate predictions revealed a seasonally high aggregation of sailfish off the southeast Brazilian 
coast during peak spawning while the mid-west Atlantic to the south of ~15°S as well as the 
Brazilian north coast may represent important  winter feeding grounds. The oceanographic 
model revealed that SST and wind velocity were the most important variables describing catch 
rate variation. Regarding pop-up tags, the results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat 
utilization of sailfish, with the majority of the time spent being predominantly concentrated near 
the sea surface with a relatively narrow temperature range preference. In brief, the “most 
probable tracks” suggest that tagged sailfish did not move significantly away from the tagging 
site. Finally, in the present dissertation, new insights regarding the stock structure of sailfish in 
the Atlantic Ocean were presented and discussed. Although the separation of the northwest 
sailfish stock seems to be clear, there is still a large uncertainty about the degree of mixing 
between southwestern and eastern sailfish.   

Key words: Sailfish, spawning season, sex ratio, fecundity, spatial prediction, catch at size, 
catch rate standardization, pop-up satellite tagging , Atlantic Ocean.

Chapter 1 - Introdução Geral 
1.1. Introdução 

O agulhão-vela, Istiophorus platypterus, pertencente à Ordem Perciformes e à 

Família Istiophoridae (Nakamura, 1985), possui distribuição circumglobal, encontrando-se 

amplamente distribuído em águas tropicais e temperadas. No oceano Atlântico a espécie ocorre, 

baseado em dados de captura, entre 40°N a 40°S, na porção oeste, e entre 50°N e 32°S, na 

porção leste (Ueyagnagi et al., 1970; Ovchinnikov, 1971; Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, 

1985). A presença da espécie no Mar Mediterrâneo tem sido também relatada, embora tais 

registros, além de raros, tenham se baseado em espécimes jovens, gerando dúvidas a respeito de 

sua identificação (Nakamura, 1985). É uma espécie oceânica, epipelágica e migradora, sendo 

geralmente encontrada em águas quentes acima da termoclina (entre 21 e 28°C), embora realize 

incursões eventuais em águas mais profundas (Nakamura, 1985). Apresenta um padrão 

migratório associado ao deslocamento sazonal das isotermas de superfície, situando-se 

normalmente em temperaturas acima de 26°C (Ueyagnagi et al., 1970). 

Entre as espécies de peixe de bico, o agulhão-vela é a que apresenta hábitos 

menos oceânicos. No Atlântico oeste tropical é freqüentemente encontrado sobre a plataforma 

continental, sobretudo no Golfo do México, Mar do Caribe e costa nordeste do Brasil. Embora, 

ocasionalmente, possa formar cardumes ou pequenos grupos, variando entre três e trinta 

indivíduos, é geralmente encontrado isolado, sem formar agregações (Beardsley et al., 1975; 

Nakamura, 1985).  É uma espécie heterossexual, não havendo características morfológicas 

externas ou coloração diferenciada entre machos e fêmeas, embora os espécimes maiores 

usualmente sejam do sexo feminino. Pode atingir um comprimento máximo de aproximadamente 

348 cm e 100 kg de peso, com os machos alcançando a maturidade com 110 cm e as fêmeas com 

130 cm (Jolley Jr., 1977; Nakamura, 1985).  

O agulhão-vela é o um dos principais alvos da pesca recreacional e esportiva em 

todo o mundo, sendo uma das espécies mais capturadas por esta pescaria,  devido a sua natureza 

menos oceânica entre os peixes de bico. Por outro lado, a pesca oceânica com espinhel de 

superficie direcionada para os atuns e o espadarte, representa o maior impacto sobre os estoques 

de agulhão-vela ao redor do mundo. Além disso, os estoques da espécie também tem sofrido 



12 

 

impacto de pescarias de pequena escala direcionadas ao dourado (Coryphaena Hippurus) no 

sudeste do Brasil e no Mar do Caribe. Entre os peixes de bico, o agulhão-vela é a espécie mais 

capturada e comercializada no Caribe. Em Barbados, por exemplo, a espécie perfaz 73% da 

captura total de peixes de bico (Mohammed et al. 2003). No Atlantico leste tropical, a espécie 

também é capturada incidentalmente na pesca de cerco européia (Gaertner et al. 2002) e na pesca 

artesanal com redes de emalhar frente a costa de Gana e Senegal (ICCAT, 2009). Sendo assim, 

os estoques da espécie vêm sendo submetidos a uma intensa pressão pesqueira, a qual nas 

últimas décadas se intensificou de forma acentuada, não apenas pelo crescimento da pesca de 

espinhel e de pequena escala, mas também pela crescente popularização da pesca esportiva.  

Em função do seu comportamento altamente migratório, a espécie é capturada por 

vários países e diferentes artes de pesca, o que faz com que a avaliação e o manejo de seus 

estoques só sejam possíveis por meio de esforços conjuntos de várias nações. No caso da pesca 

de atuns e afins no Atlântico, a organização responsável pela avaliação e manejo dos estoques de 

agulhões é a Comissão Internacional para a Conservação do Atum Atlântico (ICCAT - 

International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), constituída atualmente por 

quase 48 países. Historicamente a ICCAT tem adotado a hipótese da existência de dois estoques 

distintos de agulhão-vela (oeste e leste) separados arbitrariamente pelos meridianos associados à 

cordilheira meso-oceânica do Atlântico (40° W no Atlântico norte e; 20°W no Atlântico sul).  

Como os estoques de agulhão-vela encontram-se atualmente em níveis muito baixos de 

biomassa, apresentando sinais claros de sobrepesca, particularmente para o estoque leste, há uma 

necessidade urgente de adoção de medidas de ordenamento que garantam a sua conservação, as 

quais, entretanto, para que sejam efetivas, dependem fortemente da disponibilidade de dados de 

captura e esforço, além de informações biológicas, os quais são ainda, infelizmente, bastante 

escassos. Além disso, a necessidade de uma melhor definição da estrutura populacional dos 

agulhões no âmbito da ICCAT é tão grande que desde 1987 vem se desenvolvendo o Programa 

de Investigação Intensiva sobre os Agulhões, incluindo trabalhos de marcação e recaptura, 

distribuição e abundância, genética, levantamento das características de seus habitats, de idade e 

crescimento, de distribuição e de biologia reprodutiva.  

Segundo as estatísticas da ICCAT, a captura de agulhão-vela no oceano Atlântico 

leste teve um aumento significativo entre as décadas de 50 e 60, passando de 95 t em 1957 para 



13 

 

1714 t em 1969. A partir de 1970 a captura continuou a aumentar atingindo o pico em 1976, com 

6.250 t, seguido por uma tendência decrescente até 1981, com 3.050 t. Em 1983 a captura voltou 

a aumentar, atingindo 4.892 t, passando por um período de decréscimo gradativo até 1999, 

quando alcançou 2.724 t. De 2000 em diante a captura de agulhão-vela se estabilizou em 

aproximadamente 3.000 t/ano. O lado leste do oceano Atlântico sempre foi responsável pela 

maior parcela da captura dessa espécie, sobretudo, entre meados da década de 70 e o inicio da 

década de 90, quando foram registradas as maiores capturas (média de ~71% do total capturado 

no Atlântico). A partir da década de 90, a participação de ambos os lados do Atlântico se 

equilibraram em um patamar semelhante, embora o Atlântico oriental ainda apresente uma 

ligeira predominância nas capturas.  

1.2. Identificação do problema abordado na tese 

Historicamente o manejo dos recursos pesqueiros tem sido embasado em modelos 

de dinâmica populacional que levam em consideração apenas as alterações da abundância dos 

recursos ao longo do tempo (Hilborn e Walters, 1992). Tais modelos consideram as variáveis 

demográficas (abundância populacional) e ambientais de forma estacionária e correlacionadas 

dentro de uma escala temporal (i.e. médias anuais calculadas para extensas áreas geográficas) 

(Ciannelli et al., 2008). Entretanto, apesar desses modelos fornecerem sinais de como os 

mecanismos denso-dependentes influenciam a dinâmica populacional dos recursos explotados, 

eles podem, ao mesmo tempo, potencialmente distorcer a interpretação acerca das interações 

entre o ambiente e a abundância dos recursos (Brill e Lutcavage, 2001), já que na maioria dos 

casos, em razão da falta de dados, a variabilidade populacional é considerada espacialmente 

homogênea.  

Os organismos aquáticos, de uma maneira geral, apresentam uma elevada 

sensibilidade às variações das condições ambientais, decorrente de sua maior vulnerabilidade ao 

meio no qual estão imersos. Por essa razão, flutuações ambientais podem retardar ou acelerar, 

significativamente, a recuperação de um determinado estoque pesqueiro. Além disso, as 

mudanças no regime ambiental também podem determinar períodos de aumento da produção de 

alguns recursos importantes em algumas áreas e o declínio equivalente para outras populações, 

com consequências potencialmente negativas para o setor pesqueiro. A constante mudança 

espaço-temporal do meio ambiente é que condiciona a concentração das principais espécies de 



14 

 

atuns e afins numa determinada área e época do ano, onde as condições oceanográficas são 

favoráveis à reprodução ou à alimentação dessas espécies (Fréon e Misund, 1999), 

principalmente de espécies pelágicas que realizam grandes migrações, como é o caso do 

agulhão-vela.  

Apesar do impacto das variações ambientais sobre a captura e distribuição dos 

recursos pesqueiros ter sido bastante discutido na arena internacional, em conjunção com a 

necessidade crescente de se buscar cada vez mais um manejo pesqueiro baseado no ecossistema 

(ecosystem-based fisheries management) (Pikitch et al., 2004), estudos sobre o agulhão-vela com 

essa abordagem no Atlântico sul são particularmente raros. Por exemplo, na costa sudeste e sul 

do Brasil, concentrações de agulhão-vela têm sido observadas apenas nos meses quentes, entre 

setembro e março, quando a espécie concentra-se nessa região para realizar a desova (Arfelli e 

Amorim, 1981, Mourato et al., 2009a). Na costa norte e nordeste, o agulhão-vela é capturado ao 

longo do ano, embora com rendimentos bem menores do que no sudeste e sul do Brasil durante o 

verão (Mourato et al., 2009a) e com participação relativa na produção total da frota atuneira 

sediada no nordeste, de apenas 1,5%, representando cerca de 13% dos agulhões capturados 

(Hazin et al., 1994).  

Sendo assim, a presente tese visou suprir as lacunas desta área do conhecimento 

para o oceano Atlântico sul, estudando-se a relação entre a heterogeneidade espacial das capturas 

de agulhão-vela e a variação das condições ambientais, de forma a se compreender se elas 

interferem na capturabilidade no espinhel pelágico, bem como no ciclo migratório e sua relação 

com a época de desova da espécie.  

1.3. Objetivos 

1.3.1. Objetivo geral 

O objetivo geral deste estudo foi aprofundar os conhecimentos sobre a dinâmica 

populacional do agulhão-vela no Atlântico sul, incluindo estudos sobre sua abundância relativa, 

distribuição, uso do habitat, comportamento e biologia reprodutiva. Para este propósito, 

primeiramente foi abordado os aspectos relativos à biologia reprodutiva da espécie, analisando-

se um número considerável de amostras com ampla abrangência geográfica, o que permitiu 

identificar e delinear com maior precisão a áreas de desova da espécie no Atlântico sudoeste 



15 

 

equatorial. Em seguida, foram analisados dados de captura e esforço de pesca, bem como uma 

série temporal de dados de distribuição de frequência de comprimentos em conjunção com 

diversas variáveis ambientais (temperatura da superfície do mar, profundidade do topo da 

termoclina, concentração de clorofila, etc.) através de modelos robustos de regressão não-linear. 

A partir dessa análise, foi possível identificar os padrões de distribuição espaço-temporal das 

capturas e sua relação com a época de desova da espécie, bem como descrever o padrão de 

distribuição e preferências ambientais de indivíduos adultos e sub-adultos/juvenis no Atlântico 

sul. Além disso, objetivando-se identificar com maior precisão os movimentos migratórios e 

utilização do habitat da espécie, também foi utilizada a metodologia de telemetria via satélite, 

por meio das marcas PSAT (Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags). Essa análise possibilitou um melhor 

entendimento dos movimentos verticais e sua relação com a vulnerabilidade e capturabilidade da 

espécie no espinhel pelágico, bem como o tempo de residência em determinadas áreas e sua 

relação com a época de desova da espécie no Atlântico sul. Por fim, foi efetuada uma discussão 

geral sobre os principais resultados obtidos, levando-se em consideração os aspectos 

relacionados com o manejo pesqueiro da espécie, bem como a estrutura do estoque da espécie no 

Atlântico sul.

Chapter 2 - Spawning seasonality, sexual 
maturity, sex ratio and fecundity of sailfish in 
the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean 
Abstract 

The biological samples examined in the present study were collected by observers 

of the National Observer Program of the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture, from 

2006 to 2009, on board of tuna longliners based in the ports of Natal (RN) and Cabedelo (PB) 

(Area 1). Additionally, gonad samples were also obtained from small longliners, based in the 

port of Cabo Frio (RJ), located in the southeast coast of Brazil, and from tuna longliners based in 

São Paulo State (Santos- SP) (Area 2). All specimens were measured for lower jaw-fork length 

(LJFL) and to assign maturity phases, the microscopic characteristics of histological sections, the 

distribution of oocyte diameters and the gonadal index (GI) were considered. A total of 250 

specimens were examined from Area 1, 168 of which were females, ranging in LJFL from 104 to 

210 cm, and 82 were males, ranging from 134 to 185 cm. A total of 375 specimens were 

examined from area 2, 171 of which were females, ranging in LJFL from 122 to 197 cm, and 204 

were males, from 104 to 197 cm LJFL. The ovaries of 280 females could be classed into six 

ovarian development phases based on microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group 

of oocytes. The relationship between the fraction mature and size can be described by a logistic 

curve with lengths at 50% and 95% maturity (LJFL50 and LJFL95) of 147.31 ±1.01 cm LJFL 

(estimate ± standard error, SE) and 168.18 ± 1.01 cm LJFL. Batch fecundity estimates ranged 

from 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female to 2.26 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 

183 cm LJFL female. According to the results, the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off 

Brazilian coast (Area 1), is not a spawning ground for sailfish, since most of the specimens were 

classified as immature or developing, with few spawning capable females and the total absence 

of actively spawning specimens. The southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be an 

important spawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from 

December to February. 



19 

 

2.1. Introduction 

In the Atlantic Ocean, sailfish is widely distributed in subtropical and tropical 

waters and occasionally in temperate waters, occurring also in the Mediterranean Sea. 

Geographical limits for its distribution, based on commercial catches, is approximately 40°N in 

the western North Atlantic, 50°N in the eastern North Atlantic, 40°S in the western South 

Atlantic, and 32°S in the eastern South Atlantic (Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). The 

impact of fishing on billfish stocks in the south Atlantic is currently on focus of considerable 

international concern. Major recreational fisheries for billfishes (Istiophoridae) exist throughout 

the world’s tropical oceans, thus placing them among the most sought-after big gamefish (IGFA, 

2001). Besides, although billfishes are not a target species, they are also caught in great numbers 

by commercial fisheries, including both industrial, such as the tuna longline fishery, and artisanal 

(ICCAT, 2009). 

The first assessment of sailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean was conducted by the 

Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) of the International Commission for the 

Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009. Conclusions of the assessment indicated 

evidences of overfishing, particularly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the results 

were interpreted with considerable caution due to data deficiencies and the resulting uncertainty 

in the assessment (ICCAT, 2009). It was clear also that there remains considerable uncertainty 

regarding the stock structure of the sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean. These uncertainties linger on 

mainly due to the lack of adequate information about catch and effort data, since most countries 

often report their fishery statistics to the ICCAT without distinguishing between sailfish and 

spearfish and landings data for these two species are usually combined. 

Furthermore, the current stock assessment model used to assess population status 

of sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean is hampered by the lack of information on life history of this 

species, such as age, growth and reproductive biology. It is important, for instance, to quantify 

the reproductive potential of sailfish for a better understanding of the population dynamics of this 

species. In addition, the delineation of spawning grounds is fundamental for the potential 

establishment of time-area closures to protect and ensure the spawning and consequently the 

recruitment of heavily exploited species. Besides, the identification of the spawning grounds, 

including their degree of spatiotemporal isolation, might help the delineation of different stocks. 



20 

 

Up to now, the available information on the reproductive biology of sailfish in the 

Atlantic Ocean is restricted to gonad assessments and larval surveys, most of which conducted in 

the North Atlantic (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977; de Sylva and Breder 1997; Post et al., 1997; Luthy 

2004; Richardson et al., 2009a and b). The available information for the south Atlantic is 

restricted to gonad weights from few individuals caught off the coast of Brazil, according to 

which the majority of spawning activity takes place off the southeast coast, during summer 

months (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Hazin et al., 1994). However, detailed information on 

ovarian development, sex ratio, size at maturity, fecundity or spawning is not yet available.  

In this context, the general goal of the present chapter was to examine the 

reproductive dynamics of sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean in order to 

provide life history information useful for stock assessment, including the spatial and temporal 

variation in reproductive activity, based on histological analysis of gonads and gonad weight 

indices. Reproductive parameters estimated included: length/season/region-specific sex-ratios, 

size at maturity, batch fecundity and spawning frequency.  

2.2. Material and Methods 

2.2.1. Sample collection and area of study 

The biological samples examined in the present study were collected by observers 

of the National Observer Program of the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture, from 

2006 to 2009, on board of tuna longliners based in the ports of Natal (RN) and Cabedelo (PB), 

located in northeast coast of Brazil. Additionally, gonad samples were also obtained from small 

longliners, based in the port of Cabo Frio (RJ), located in the southeast coast of Brazil, and from 

tuna longliners based in São Paulo State (Santos- SP) (Figure 2.1). In order to evaluate the spatial 

variability of the reproductive activity, the analysis was conducted in two separate areas: a) Area 

1, for samples obtained from longliners based in Northeast Brazil, which operated in the 

equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean; and b) Area 2, for those collected from vessels 

based in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, operating off the southeast coast of Brazil (Figure 2.1). 

All specimens were measured for lower jaw-fork length (LJFL), being then dissected for the 

collection of gonads, which were then frozen and stored in freezers, up to the time of landing. 

Sex was initially determined from the macroscopic characteristics of the gonads. 



21 

 

2.2.2. Assessing the reproductive activity 

In the laboratory, the gonads were thawed, individually weighted (±0.1 g) and 

measured for the total length and width. A sub-sample was kept in 10% neutral formalin solution 

for posterior microscopic analysis. To assign maturity phases to the examined specimens, the 

microscopic characteristics of histological sections, the distribution of oocyte diameters and the 

gonadal index (GI) were considered (West, 1990; Arocha, 2002; Brown-Peterson et al., 2011). 

Histological sections were prepared from gonad tissue samples embedded in 

paraffin, sectioned at approximately 5µm, and stained with Harris’s haematoxylin and eosin. 

Histological examination assisted the field-classified sex, especially for small specimens. Each 

ovary was staged according to the microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group of 

oocytes (MAGO) present in the sample, including:  primary growth oocytes, cortical alveolar, 

vitellogenic oocytes, germinal vesicle migration or hydrated. Post-ovulatory follicles (Hunter et 

al. 1985; Murua et al., 2003) were identified and atresia of vitellogenic oocytes was recorded to 

aid in the determination of the reproductive condition. Additionally, to confirm that the sailfish is 

a multiple spawner, the frequency distribution of diameter of approximately 300 oocytes from 

eleven females with gonads with hydrated oocytes (actively spawning females) was analyzed. 

The diameters (mm) of whole oocytes were obtained randomly from each female, with the 

assistance of a stereomicroscope with a micrometer. 

The sex ratio was analyzed by month and LJFL, with the statistical significance of 

the differences being tested by the chi-square test (?2, ?=0.05). After assigning the maturity 

stages, the monthly mean GI was estimated for adult specimens (excluding the immature 

specimens), for determination of spawning period. The GI was calculated based on Cayré and 

Laloé (1986), as follows: 43 10??

2.2.3. Reproductive parameters population 

The length at which 50% of all individuals were sexually mature (L50) was 

estimated only from specimens caught during the spawning season and from the spawning area. 

Females were defined as mature if they presented cotical alveolar, vitellogenic oocytes, germinal 



22 

 

vesicle migration, or hydrated oocytes. The probability that the ith fish was mature (Pi) was 

modeled using a logistic curve, described by Sun et al. (2009), as: 

( ) ( )[ ]( )955050)19ln(11 LJFLLJFLLJFLLJFLi ieP ???+= , 
where LJFLi = the LJFL of fish i; and LJFL50 and  LJFL95 = the LJFLs at which 

50% and 95% of the specimens reached maturity, respectively. LJFL50 and LJFL95 were 

estimated by maximizing a log-likelihood function, and by assuming a binomial error 

distribution, with R software. 

Batch fecundity (BF) was estimated gravimetrically by the hydrated oocyte 

method using fixed ovarian samples, which contained hydrated oocytes. Three subsamples (1.0 

g) were taken from each ovary, teased apart to release the oocytes, and washed thoroughly to 

release the hydrated oocytes. BF was then back-calculated by the product of gonad weight and 

oocyte density, where oocyte density was the mean number of oocytes per gram of three ovarian 

tissues with no early postovulatory follicles (Hunter et al., 1985). Regression analyses were 

conducted to quantify the relationships between batch fecundity and LJFL. 

2.2.4. Spawning pattern and annual fecundity  

The spawning interval was estimated by the hydrated oocyte method (Hunter and 

Macewicz, 1985) and was restricted to samples collected in the Area 2 during the peak spawning 

season (Arocha and Barrios, 2009), from December to February. The spawning interval (in days) 

was calculated by dividing the total number of mature females for all years combined by the 

number of actively spawning females. For the hydrated oocyte method to be a useful proxy for 

spawning frequency two assumptions were considered. The first was whether or not spawning 

occurs in the evening and the second was whether the spawning area represents a closed 

population (Arocha and Barrios, 2009). Annual fecundity was estimated as the product of 

average batch fecundity, the spawning fraction, and the duration of the spawning season.  

2.3. Results 

2.3.1. Size composition and sex ratio 

Area 1  



23 

 

A total of 250 specimens were examined from Area 1, 168 of which were females, 

ranging in LJFL from 104 to 210 cm (Figure 2.2), and 82 were males, ranging from 134 to 185 

cm (Figure 2.2). Most of the females measured from 160 to 190 cm LJFL, with a mode in 170 

cm, while most of the males showed a LJFL between 150 and 170 cm, with a mode at 160cm. 

The overall sex ratio was 2.04 females to 1 male, which differed significantly (?2 =29.584; p &amp;lt;

0.05) from the expected proportion of 1:1. Females predominated in almost all months, except 

for May, but only in September and October the difference was statistically significant (Table 

2.1, Figure 2.3). An apparent predominance of females was observed in all size classes (Figure 

2.4), but only in LJFL larger than 160 cm the differences were statistically significant (Table 

2.2).  

Area 2  

A total of 375 specimens were examined from area 2, 171 of which were females, 

ranging in LJFL from 122 to 197 cm (Figure 2.2), and 204 were males, from 104 to 197 cm 

LJFL (Figure 2.2). The LJFL frequency distribution of females showed a higher frequency of 

specimens between 150 and 180 cm, with a mode in 160 cm. For males, the LJFL frequency 

distribution showed a mode in 160 cm, with most specimens ranging from 150 to 170 cm. The 

estimated sex ratio for all samples was 0.84 female to 1 male, which not differed significantly 

from the expected proportion of 1:1. The monthly sex ratios were not significantly different from 

the expected ratio of 1:1 (p&gt;0.05) for any month (Table 2.1). A slight predominance of males 

was however observed (Figure 2.3). The sex ratio by size also showed a predominance of males 

in almost all size classes, except for 160 and 190 cm LJFL classes which not differed 

significantly (p &amp;lt;0.05) from the expected proportion of 1:1 (Table 2.2, Figure 2.4). 

2.3.2. Ovary development and spawning season  

The ovaries of 280 females could be classed into six ovarian development phases 

based on microscopic characteristics and the most advanced group of oocytes (Table 2.3, Figure 

2.5). The gonad weight of the females classified as immature ranged from 32 to 180g (Figure 

2.6). The LJFL of immature females ranged between 104 and 173 cm. Developing females, in 

turn, had a LJFL between 136 and 210 cm and GW from 51 to 1334g. Spawning capable females 

had a LJFL between 146 and 197 cm with a GW ranging from 250 to 2,752g. Actively spawning 



24 

 

females, with a LJFL between 156 and 194 cm, had a GW from 700 to 2,105g. Regressing 

females presented a LJFL between 159 and 181 cm, with a GW ranging from 163 to 1,195g 

(Figure 2.6). Recovering females had a LJFL between 157 and 210 cm and GW from 93 to 355g. 

Actively spawning females were absent in Area 1, and only 2% of the females in 

this area were in the spawning capable phase. The great majority of the specimens analyzed were 

in developing phase (57%). Immature and recovering phases accounted, respectively, for 22% 

and 17%. In contrast, in area 2, most of the specimens were spawning capable or actively 

spawning, representing, respectively, 42% and 14% of the sample. In Area 1, females with 

developing ovaries occurred in all sampled months, while immature females were more frequent 

in January and February (Figure 2.7). In area 2, females with spawning capable or regressing 

ovaries were more frequent from December to February while the proportion of immature and 

developing females was very low (Figure 2.7). The monthly GI showed higher mean values in 

Area 2, from December to February (close or more than two) (Figure 2.8). In contrast, the 

monthly mean GI in Area 1 presented much smaller values, being always less than one (Figure 

2.8). 

2.3.3. Spawning pattern  

 The smallest group had oocytes smaller than 0.4 mm, composed by primary growth 

oocytes, cortical alveolar, primary and secondary vitellogenic oocytes oocytes (Figure 2.10). The 

next larger group was composed of tertiary vitellogenic oocytes, ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 mm 

(Figure 2.10). The third group was the largest and corresponded to the germinal vesicle 

migration oocytes, germinal vesicle breakdown oocytes and hydrated oocytes, measuring 0.8-1.6 

mm (Figure 2.10). During the peak of the spawning season (December to February), an average 

of 22% of the actively spawning females was spawning daily which indicates that the average 

interval between spawning and a new batch of eggs is around 4.4 days. 

2.3.4. Length at first sexual maturity and batch fecundity 

The relationship between the fraction mature and size can be described by a 

logistic curve with lengths at 50% and 95% maturity (LJFL50 and LJFL95) of 147.21 ±1.01 cm 

LJFL (estimate ± standard error, SE) and 168.18 ± 1.01 cm LJFL (Figure 2.11Figure 2.11), 

respectively. The logistic regression was (Figure 2.11):  



25 

 

( ) ( )[ ]( )18.16831.14731.147)19ln(11 ???+= iLJFLi eP  (Pseudo-R2 = 0.77, n= 222, 5 
cm classes). 

Only 15 of the actively spawning females fit the criteria for estimating batch 

fecundity (BF) (hydrated oocytes present, without early postovulatory follicles). The LJFLs of 

these individuals ranged from 155 to 183 cm, and their gonad weights ranged from 548 to 2,752 

g. Batch fecundity  estimates ranged from 0.44 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 156 cm LJFL female 

to 2.26 x 106 hydrated oocytes for a 183 cm LJFL female (Figure 2.12). The regression equation 

was: BF = 9.026E-13 * LJFL8.122 (n= 15, pseudo-R2 = 0.62). The annual fecundity was estimated 

to range between 9 and 46 million eggs (average of 21 million). 

2.4. Discussion 

2.4.1. Size distribution and sex ratio 

Sex ratio of sailfish caught in the western equatorial south Atlantic varies 

temporally and spatially. We observed a general predominance of females in western equatorial 

Atlantic along the year while the opposite was noticed in the southeast Brazilian coast during the 

spawning season, in warmer months. The predominance of males may be consistent with sexual 

differences in migratory or reproductive behaviors, such as the greater propensity for males to 

aggregate in group-spawning pelagic species (Hunter and Macewicz, 1986). Around Florida, for 

example, sailfish is known to moves inshore, into shallow waters, where the females, swimming 

sluggishly with their dorsal fins extended and accompanied each by one or more males, may 

spawn near the surface, during the warm season (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977). Moreover, temporal 

changes in sex ratios may partly reflect different availabilities or catchabilities resulting from 

sexual differences in behavior that change seasonally (e.g. during spawning periods).  Similar 

results were also observed by Chiang et al. (2006a) in the eastern Taiwan, but they differ from 

the findings by Hernandez and Ramirez (1998) for the sailfish in the Pacific Coast of Mexico, 

where the proportion of female sailfish was higher than 50%. 

2.4.2. Ovarian development and spawning season 

The histological analysis of the ovaries and the method of most advanced group of 

oocytes, used to develop a maturity classification scheme for female sailfish in this study, 



26 

 

allowed a more precise identification of maturity phases than the traditional macroscopic 

techniques (i.e. Mourato et al. 2009). Histological studies provide very precise information on 

oocyte development, although their interpretation may be confused because different authors use 

different terminology for the same structures (West, 1990). Previous studies on histology-based 

maturity classifications for sailfish have identified five (Jolley 1977; Hernandez and Ramirez, 

1998) to seven different reproductive stages (De Sylvia and Breder, 1998; Chiang et al., 2006a). 

Differences in histological staging classification, especially for highly migratory species, make it 

difficult to compare reproductive parameters between studies in different regions of the world. In 

this study, we adopted a standardized terminology for describing reproductive development in 

fishes suggested by Brown-Peterson et al. (2011) which is applied for majority of determinate 

and indeterminate spawner fishes. The use of histology to assign the stages of ovary maturation 

permitted a clear differentiation of six different phases of maturity, which showed similar oocyte 

microscopic characteristics as those observed by Chiang et al. (2006a), for Pacific sailfish in 

Taiwanese waters.  

Spawning season and areas for the Atlantic sailfish were defined and identified by 

the combination of several methods, including: (1) the identification of actively spawning 

females with the use of histology analysis; (2) high GSI values; and (3) the position where 

actively spawning females were caught. According to the results shown in the present study, the 

equatorial and western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, off Brazilian coast (Area 1), is not a spawning 

ground for sailfish, since most of the specimens were classified as immature and developing, , 

with few spawning capable females and the total absence of actively spawning specimens. This 

is also supported by the low values of gonad index, when compared to the fish caught off 

southern Brazil (Area 2). The southeast Brazilian coast, in contrast, seems to be an important 

spawning area for the species, with the spawning season happening mainly from December to 

February. The vast majority of females caught in this area, during this period of the year, were 

either spawning capable or actively spawning, with high values of gonad indices. Important 

concentrations of mature specimens in this area were previously reported by various authors 

(Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et al., 2009; Pimenta et al., 2005).  

The presence of different batches of growing oocytes, including hydrated eggs in 

the oocyte size-frequency distribution and the presence of different generations of oocytes in 



27 

 

histological sections of spawning capable females, suggests that sailfish in the study area (Area 

2) can spawn more than once during a spawning season. Morover, assynchronous oocyte 

development was observed due to presence of all types of oocyte stage (previtellogenic and 

vitellogenic oocytes) in sections of ovaries, and mainly in spawning capable and actively 

spawning females. The presence of post-ovulatory follicles (recent spawned less than 24 hs) and 

hydrated oocytes (imminent spawning less than 12 hs) simultaneously in histological section of 

ovaries from females in actively spawning phase is an evidence of multiple spawning behavior. 

Similar findings were also reported by several authors in different regions of the world (Jolley, 

1977; Hernandez et al., 2000; Chiang et al., 2006b).  

2.4.3. Reproductive population parameters  

The LJFL50 for female sailfish was estimated at 147.31 cm, and the smallest size 

at which any female was mature was 136.0 cm LJFL. In general, there is a lack of exhaustive 

studies on sailfish sexual maturity. Prior reported estimates of body size at sexual maturity for 

female sailfish in the Atlantic Ocean in general agree with the estimates of the present study, but 

dissimilarities likely reflect the different measures used to gauge sexual maturity used in other 

works. A first attempt to estimate the L50 of sailfish in South Atlantic was reported by Mourato et 

al (2009), obtaining a LJFL of the 154.9 cm, based on macroscopic assessment of gonads.  Jolley 

(1977) reported that female sailfish caught in the western North Atlantic attains sexual maturity 

between 147 and 160 cm LJFL (13 to 18 kg). Arocha and Marcano (2006) reported an L50 for 

females sailfish caught between 5°N and 25°N in western North Atlantic of 180.2cm LJFL, but 

the analysis were derived from macroscopic and microscopic assessment of gonads without 

histological calibration. Probably the estimate of L50 reported by Arocha and Marcano (2006) 

have included fish of relatively bigger size caught off Caribbean waters, as well as a lower 

number of immature fish, which may have deviated the size at maturity upwards.  

The present estimates of L50 for female sailfish caught by Brazilian longliners are 

also smaller than those of sailfish caught in several regions of the Pacific. In the Mexican Pacific 

coast, Hernandez and Ramirez (1998) estimated that 50% of the females mature at 175 cm EOFL 

(eye-orbit fork length) (198.5 cm LJFL), based on histological analysis of gonads. In the western 

Pacific, Chiang et al. (2006a) reported a L50 of 167 cm LJFL, also based on histological 

examination.  



28 

 

The difference between the present results and the other studies cited above might 

be a combined result of different stocks, different environmental conditions, or sampling bias 

resulting from sample size and timing, i.e. whether estimates include fish caught throughout the 

entire year and fisheries range or during spawning season and area only, such as in the present 

case. The different fisheries strategies are also a likely source of variation, due the non-selective 

nature of fishing gears. 

In the present study, the power regression function provided a good relationship 

between batch fecundity with LJFL, with fecundity increasing with female size. Several authors 

have reported similar results, with fecundity increasing with the size of the sailfish, from eastern 

Africa (Merret, 1970), eastern Pacific (Hernandez et al., 2000), western Pacific (Chiang et al., 

2006b), and northwest Atlantic (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 1977). Despite the length range of spawned 

females collected in this study (155-183 cm LJFL) was slightly smaller to that reported by 

studies done in the Pacific Ocean, the batch fecundity estimated in the present work (0.44-2.26 x 

106) had a similar range from those reported by Hernandez-Herrera et al. (2000) (0.42-2.52 x 

106) and by Chiang et al. (2006b) (0.2-2.48 x 106), for Pacific sailfish. However, it differed 

slightly from the estimates (0.75-1.6 x 106) observed by Jolley (1977) for the Atlantic.  

This study presents the first attempt to estimate important parameters (i.e. size at 

maturity, fecundity) of the sailfish in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic, which can be 

useful for future stock assessments of the species in the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, the results 

presented here seem to confirm the hypothesis that sailfish spawning in the equatorial and 

southwestern Atlantic is rather limited both geographically and temporally, being greatly 

restricted to the southeast coast of Brazil, between November and February, with the peak of the 

spawning season happening in January. Further studies are however still needed, including 

tagging experiments, in order to better understand the reproductive cycle of the sailfish in the 

South Atlantic, and particularly how it is coupled with seasonal migratory movements performed 

by the species.

Chapter 3 - Environmental and spatial effects 
on the size distribution of sailfish in the Atlantic 
Ocean 
Abstract  

Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction (GRASP) was applied to 

size data for sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) to better describe its preferential habitats, in 

relation to juveniles and adults, based on environmental and spatial factors in the equatorial and 

southwestern Atlantic. A total of 9,954 Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL) size data (7,541 fish 

caught by longline and 2,413 by gillnet) from the International Commission for the Conservation 

of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) database, were analyzed from 1998 to 2007. Four main 

environmental variables were considered: sea surface temperature, depth of mixed layer, 

chlorophyll concentration and bathymetry. Results indicated that adults were more frequent to 

the east of 25°W in areas with shallow mixed layer (&lt;30m) between 3000 and 6000 m depth with 

SSTs lower than 24°C. Chlorophyll concentration showed the highest proportion of adults 

between 0.3 and 0.8 mg/m3. High densities of adults were also observed to the west of 40oW, 

both at northern and southern parts of the studied area. An opposite trend was observed in 

relation to juveniles, which appear to be associated with waters with SSTs higher than 28°C and 

deep mixed layer (&gt;50m) in the western side, particularly between 10° - 20°S and 25° - 35°W. 

3.1. Introduction 

Sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw and Nodder, 1791), is an important 

commercial and recreational fisheries resource, being exploited throughout all tropical and 

subtropical oceans. Sailfish has been recognized by some authors as comprising Atlantic and 

Indo-Pacific species (Nakamura, 1985). However, genetic data are consistent with the existence 

of a single species (Finnerty and Block, 1995; Graves, 1998) with a worldwide distribution 

(Beardsley et al. 1975) and, therefore, the sailfish, together with the blue marlin (Makaira 

nigricans), are the only pandemic istiophorid billfishes (Nakamura, 1985). Due to its highly 

migratory nature, it is fished by several nations with different fishing gears. Consequently, 

international management is required, which in the Atlantic Ocean, comes under the jurisdiction 



44 

 

of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Fishing 

impacts on Atlantic billfish stocks is currently the focus of considerable international concern. 

Bycatch fishing mortality in pelagic longline fisheries, targeting tunas and swordfish, represents 

one of the main impacts on billfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean (Uozomi, 2003). In the eastern 

tropical Atlantic, a large amount of billfishes are also caught as bycatch in European purse-seine 

fisheries (Gaertner et al., 2002), and by artisanal fisheries, such as the canoe fishery, in Ghana 

(ICCAT, 2009). In addition, billfishes are also a very important resource for various coastal and 

artisanal fisheries in the Caribbean, as well as for recreational fisheries, mainly in USA, 

Venezuela, Brazil and several Caribbean countries (Peel et al., 2003). In the most recent sailfish 

assessment, using data up to 2008, results indicated a decline in biomass of the sailfish stocks, 

particularly for the east Atlantic. However, the analyses in this assessment were severely 

hampered by an acute lack of accurate data (ICCAT, 2009). One of the main requirements for a 

proper assessment of stock condition is an understanding of its geographic stock structure and 

identification of the main areas of occurrence of different size classes, as well as the influence of 

environmental factors on distribution.  

Size frequency data from the commercial longline fishery have always been an 

important information for understanding the changes in the age structure of the stocks and the 

seasonal variability in the distribution of tunas and tuna-like species in relation to environmental 

and spatial factors. A number of methods have been applied to investigate the fishery 

oceanography of pelagic species. These include generalized linear models (GLM), habitat based 

models, generalized additive models (GAM), regression tree models and Geographic Information 

Systems (GIS) (Swartzman et al., 1992, Hinton and Nakano, 1996, Zheng et al., 2004, Valavanis 

et al., 2004, Venables and Ditchmond, 2004, Maunder and Punt, 2004, Valavanis et al., 2008). 

Another approach is the employment of spatial prediction techniques based on interpolation 

algorithms (e.g. kriging), which are generally highly data intensive, requiring large amounts of 

well distributed data. This requirement is rarely attainable by fisheries data, especially when the 

studied species is not the main target of the fishery, such as it is commonly the case for billfishes 

(Ortiz and Arocha, 2004). 

Recently, a new method based on statistical models for spatial prediction has been 

developed, called GRASP (Generalized Regression Analysis and Spatial Prediction). This 



45 

 

method uses statistical relationships between response (i.e. species distribution) and 

environmental variables to model spatial prediction by means of prediction maps (Lehmann et al. 

2002).  

In the GRASP approach, GAM models are used to fit the response variables to the 

environmental explanatory variables using a non-parametric smoothing function (Hastie and 

Tibshirani, 1990). The GRASP approach has been proved to be suitable for fisheries resources. It 

was initially applied in the South Atlantic Ocean to model the spatial distribution of swordfish 

(Xiphias gladius), using data from Brazilian commercial longline fisheries (Hazin and Erzini, 

2008). In the present paper, GRASP was applied to size data of sailfish caught by longline and 

gillnet fisheries obtained from ICCAT data record to better understand the relationship between 

size distribution and spatial and environmental factors. 

3.2. Material and methods 

3.2.1. Size data 

Data on length frequency distribution (Lower Jaw Fork Length (LJFL) in cm) 

were obtained from the ICCAT Data Record on fish caught by longline and gillnet fisheries 

operating in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic. The data were grouped in 5°x5° stratum 

considering the initial position of the fishing operation, by month, year, latitude and longitude, 

from 1998 to 2007. A total of 9,954 LJFL data were utilized, of which 7,541 were from catches 

of longline fleets based in Brazil, Venezuela and Spain, and 2,413 were from catches of gillnet 

fisheries based in Côte D’ Ivoire, Ghana and Venezuela. The spatial distribution and density of 

these data are show in Figure 3.1. To evaluate the spatial distribution by length, two LJFL size 

classes were established following procedures described by Jolley (1977) and Mourato et al., 

(2009a) as follows: (a)&amp;lt;155 cm, immature individuals (or juveniles), (b) &gt;155 cm, mature 

individuals (or adults). These data were transformed into proportion of juveniles and adults, by 

5o square, assuming a binomial distribution.  

3.2.2. Environmental data 

A time-series of sea surface temperature (SST) and mixed layer depth (DML) 

were obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC) - 



46 

 

Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA (1998–2007).  The bathymetry (BATH) at the location of the 

fishing sets (BATH) was obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center (ETOPO5 - Earth 

Topography 5 min). Chlorophyll-? concentration (CHO) were obtained from SeaWiFS images, 

provided by “SeaWiFS Project” from Goddard Space Flight Center/NASA. These images were 

turned into numerical data (in mg/m3) with the GDRA2XYZ program provided by the Phoenix 

Training Consultants. These data, with an original resolution of 0.5° (except Chlorophyll- ? 

concentration, which had a initial resolution of 9 km resolution), were used to construct a 

database of 5°×5° resolution, by month, year, latitude and longitude. These data were then 

matched with the length frequency data.  

3.2.3. Modeling 

The spatial prediction of the proportion of adult individuals (PR) as a function of 

environmental and spatial variables was modeled using GRASP v3.2 (Lehmann et al., 2002). In 

the GRASP approach, the spatial predictions are obtained by the relationships between a 

response variable (proportion of individuals at adult stage) and selected predictor variables 

(environmental and spatial variables) by the fitting of a GAM model. The general formulation of 

the GAM is expressed in the following manner: 

PR = a + s1(x1) + sj(xj) . . . + e 

where PR is the proportion of adults, a is a constant, s1 is the effect of the 

smoothing function for the independent variable x1 and e is the random error of the function. The 

non-linear effects of the model were adjusted by smoothing “Spline” functions (natural cubic) 

with four degrees of freedom. The choice of the degrees of freedom was based on visual 

inspection and exploratory analysis. Such approach allows the detection of major effects and 

reduces spurious patterns that can arise from overfitting (Maravelias et al., 2000). The binomial 

distribution was used with a logit link function. Due to a spatial distribution discontinuity of the 

LJFL classes, the analysis was restricted to the delimited area shown in the Figure 3.1. This is 

necessary due to the decreased predictive capacity of the models in areas with low density of 

data. 

The consistency of the final model was evaluated using: 1) linear regression 

between randomly chosen observed values of proportion of adults and those generated by the 



47 

 

model using the included independent variables as input (simple validation) and 2) a cross-

validation method which assessed the goodness of fit of the model. The correlation between the 

observed and predicted values was estimated by the Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the 

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) test was used for the binomial model. ROC indicates 

model performance, independently of the apparently arbitrary probability threshold required in 

the proportion models, at which the presence of a target feature is accepted (Fielding and Bell, 

1997). A total of 5,000 lengths were randomly chosen from the length frequency data set 

(besides the 9,954 measurements used in the model). These were used for the exclusive purpose 

of cross validation, and therefore were not included in the model. Predictors were selected using 

a forward and backward stepwise procedure, going in both directions from a full model and 

removing predictors according to an F-test (?= 0.05).The relative effect of each xj variable over 

the dependent variable (here the proportion of adults) was evaluated using the distribution of 

partial residuals.  

3.3. Results 

The final model explained 52.8% of the total variance, including latitude, 

longitude, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-? concentration, depth of mixed layer and 

bathymetry as continuous variables and month as a factor. The relative contribution for each 

variable in the total explained variance (52.8%) for the selected model shows that longitude 

effect was the most significant factor in the analysis. Among the environmental variables, the 

depth of mixed layer was the most important, followed by chlorophyll-? concentration, sea 

surface temperature and bathymetry (Figure 3.2). The results of the simple and cross-validations 

of the final model are also shown in the table 1. The ROC values (validation and cross-

validation, 0.78, 0.81, respectively) indicate that predictions were reasonably fitted and matched 

well with the data.  

There was an increase in the proportion of adults to 0.3 mg/m3 of chlorophyll-? 

concentration, then rather stable at higher concentrations (Figure 3.3). The effect of bathymetry 

indicated that adult sailfish were more abundant than juveniles when depths exceeded 4,000 m. 

Adult sailfish were also more abundant in areas when depth of the mixed layer was less than 20 

m and in waters with SST was&amp;lt;24°C (Figure 3.3). The proportion of adults was highest in 

March and September (Figure 3.3). 



48 

 

Spatial prediction (Figure 3.4) shows that adult sailfish were more frequent to the 

west of 40oW, both at northern and southern parts of the studied area, as well as to the east of 

25oW. Along the Brazilian coast, from 25oW to 40oW, the proportion of adults was very low in 

particular from 10oS to 25oS (Figure 3.4).     

3.4. Discussion 

A proper understanding of essential fish habitats has been considered crucial to 

the development of fishery management strategies based on an ecosystem approach (Valavanis et 

al., 2004). In this study, the GRASP tool was used to describe the preferential habitats of sailfish, 

in relation to juveniles and adults, based on size distribution, environmental and spatial data. 

There have been many applications of GRASP, including use with terrestrial animals (Fraser et 

al., 2005), plants (Lehmann et al., 2002; Zerger et al., 2009), seagrass (Bekkby et al., 2008) and 

coral reefs (Garza-Pérez et al., 2004).  

Although the spatial factor longitude provided the highest explanatory ability on 

the proportion of adults of sailfish, the environmental effects were also significant. The inclusion 

of environmental variables in the analysis often resulted in low levels of explanation, because 

fishing and environmental data were generally not obtained simultaneously (Brill and Lutcavage, 

2001) and relationships are not well described on scales of 5°- month data. Conversely, many 

species, in particular the highly migratory, have a life cycle strictly related to environmental 

conditions that affect their availability and vulnerability (Fréon and Misund, 1999). Thus, the 

inclusion of environmental variables in the model is relevant for an appropriate understanding of 

the distribution of sailfish in the South Atlantic Ocean.  

The much higher proportion of adults east of 25oW, agrees with Beardsley (1980) 

and Prince and Goodyear (2006), who also indicated that the largest sailfish are located on the 

eastern side of the Atlantic. Data on size distribution of sailfish from the Pacific Ocean also 

shows a similar trend to the South Atlantic with the largest fish being concentrated in the eastern 

side of that ocean (Kume and Joseph, 1969; Wares and Sakagawa, 1974; Prince and Goodyear, 

2006). The difference in size distribution of sailfish in both sides of the South Atlantic is likely 

linked to life cycle and migratory movements, which, in turn, is probably related to the diverse 

oceanographic conditions affecting habitat preferences of juveniles and adults in a different 

manner. Prince and Goodyear (2006), however, attribute the larger size of eastern Atlantic and 



49 

 

eastern Pacific sailfish as a likely consequence of hypoxia based habitat compression which 

increases ambush opportunities for sailfish which are compressed in a shallow surface layer 

along with their prey. The eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean is characterized by intense nutrient 

upwelling with a consequently very shallow thermocline (~25 m) and high surface chlorophyll 

concentration. Upwelling off the coasts of Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria occurs seasonally, 

with a weak upwelling from January to March, and intense upwelling from July to September 

(Longhurst,1962; Picaut, 1983; Ibe and Ajayi, 1985). Conversely, the western Atlantic has a 

warm surface layer, a deep thermocline (~75 m) and much lower surface chlorophyll 

concentration (Hazin, 1993; Becker, 2001). Juveniles appear to be associated with waters with 

SSTs higher than 28°C in the western side, particularly between 10° - 20°S and 25° - 35°W. 

Besides, the higher concentration of juveniles in the western side can also be a result of their 

proximity to the spawning area, dispersing later from this location as they grow (Mourato et al., 

2009a). Adult sailfish, in turn, seem to be more common in the eastern side of the Atlantic with 

large concentrations occurring close to the African coast and the Gulf of Guinea, an area very 

rich in nutrient content, consequently, increasing the amount of potential sailfish prey, such as 

small cupleids, like Engraulis sp. and Sardinella sp. (Ibe and Ajayi, 1985; Ovichinikov, 1971). 

Sailfish have an opportunistic feeding behavior and it is, thus, commonly attracted to regions 

with high concentrations of prey (Beardsley et al., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). 

The model used in the current analyses considered four main environmental 

variables: SST, mixed layer depth, chlorophyll concentration and bathymetry, all of which have 

been linked to billfish abundance (Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Ovichinikov, 1971; Nakamura, 1985; 

Brill and Lutcavage, 2001; Prince and Goodyear, 2006). Sailfish spend most of the time in the 

mixed layer and prefer waters with temperatures between 25º and 30º C, as shown by other 

studies based on PSAT tags and ultrasonic telemetry (Hoolihan, 2004; Prince and Goodyear, 

2006; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Mourato et al., 2010). The preference for near surface and 

warmer waters was also reported for other Istiophoridae fishes in the Atlantic Ocean (white 

marlin, Tetrapturus albidus: Horodysky and Graves, 2005; Horodysky et al., 2007; blue marlin, 

Makaira nigricans: Graves et al., 2002; Goodyear et al., 2008). Therefore, sailfish and others 

Isthiophorids, the depth of mixed layer which marks the top of the thermocline is an important 

feature that might directly affect vulnerability, catchability and local abundance. Prince and 

Goodyear (2006) pointed out that the depth distribution of sailfish in areas with intense 



50 

 

upwelling processes may be restricted to the thin layer as shallow as 25 m at the surface ocean by 

the compression of the acceptable physical habitat due to the lower concentration of dissolved 

oxygen below the thermocline, turning them more vulnerable to the surface fishing gears (i.e. 

longline and gillnet).  

In the Eastern tropical Atlantic, sailfish abundance varies seasonally, linked to the 

cooling of surface water by the seasonal intensification of the upwelling process. Sailfish move 

along the African coast from south to north, in spring, and apparently back again, from north to 

south, in autumn, following the warmer isotherms (Ovchinikov, 1971; Diouf, 1994; Bard et al., 

2002).  

Similarly, several studies have shown that sailfish abundance is highly seasonal in 

the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, as well (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Hazin et al., 1994; 

Mourato et al., 2009a and b). Mourato et al. (2009a) stated that the sailfish start its reproductive 

migration from the Brazilian northeast coast to southeast, in mid-September, arriving in the 

southeast Brazilian coast in November/December. Spawning takes place mainly during January/ 

February, with the species remaining near the southeast coast until early March. As it has been 

shown to occur with white and blue marlin, this southward migratory movement is probably 

related to the seasonal change of SST, reflected in the displacement of surface isotherms. Several 

authors have reported that the sailfish migratory pattern is restricted to the 28°C surface isotherm 

in several parts of the world (Ovchinnikov, 1971;Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Nakamura, 1985), a SST 

that occurs only during the 1st and 4th quarters of the year along the southeast coast of Brazil 

(Matsuura, 1986).

Chapter 4 - Spatio-temporal trends of sailfish 
catch rates in relation to spawning season and 
environmental factors in the equatorial and 
southwestern Atlantic Ocean 
Abstract 

Spatial and temporal trends of sailfish catch rates in the southwestern and 

equatorial Atlantic Ocean in relation to environmental variables were investigated with 

generalized additive models (GAMs) using fishery dependent data that were contemporaneously 

collected with biological information. Two GAMs were fit: (1) “spatio-temporal” including only 

latitude, longitude, month, and year and (2) “oceanographic” including sea surface temperature 

(SST), chlorophyll-a concentration, wind velocity, bottom depth, depth of mixed layer and year. 

The spatio-temporal model explained more (average, ~30%) of the variation in catch rates than 

the oceanographic model (average, ~18%). Catch rate predictions revealed a seasonally high 

aggregation of sailfish off the southeast Brazilian coast during peak spawning (November to 

February) while the mid-west Atlantic to the south of  ~15°S as well as the Brazilian north coast 

may represent important  winter feeding grounds. The oceanographic model revealed that SST 

and wind velocity were the most important variables describing catch rate variation. The results 

presented herein may help to understand sailfish movements in the Atlantic Ocean and to 

improve catch rate standardization.  

4.1. Introduction 

Sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, is a circumtropical epipelagic species mainly 

distributed in subtropical and tropical oceanic waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, sailfish are 

distributed from 40ºN to 40ºS in the west and from 50ºN to about 40ºS in the east (Beardsley et 

al., 1975; Nakamura, 1985). Important sport and artisanal (e.g. drift net) fisheries target these 

species in Atlantic waters (Brison et al., 2006; ICCAT, 2009), but sailfish are considered bycatch 

in most commercial longline fisheries targeting tunas (Thunnus spp.) and swordfish (Xiphias 

gladius) throughout the Atlantic Ocean (Restrepo et al., 2003). In Brazil, sailfish are caught 

primarily by pelagic longline fisheries as incidental bycatch, although some are also caught by 



56 

 

drift gill nets. Off the Brazilian coast, sailfish are abundant throughout the year mainly in tropical 

areas with the peak abundance from October to February in the southeast Brazilian coast. From 

1991 to 2006, annual landings of sailfish in Brazil have fluctuated from 90 t in 1991, to 598 t in 

2000 and then decreased to 140 t in 2006.  

Atlantic sailfish populations have been managed by the International Commission 

for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 1966. Based on distribution of catch, 

tagging information, and morphological data, ICCAT has traditionally considered this species to 

comprise two different stocks in the Atlantic Ocean with western and eastern stocks separated 

arbitrarily by the meridians associated with the mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 40ºW in the north Atlantic 

and 20ºW in the south Atlantic). Limited tag-recapture data has indicated no trans-Atlantic or 

trans-equatorial movements (Ortiz et al., 2003; Orbesen et al., 2008).  Furthermore, analysis of 

the distribution of catch-at-length data indicated that at least part of the sailfish population in the 

Atlantic was structured longitudinally by ontogenetic stages, as reflected by by environmental 

preferences of adults and juveniles or sub-adults (Mourato et al., 2010a).  This two-stock 

hypothesis, however, requires further investigation because genetic analyses suggest Atlantic 

sailfish comprise a single, highly mobile, pan-Atlantic stock (Graves 1998, Graves and 

McDowell 2003).   

For highly migratory fishes, one of the essential requirements for understanding 

population dynamics is the delineation of the spatial variability of the stock during important 

biological processes. Migration to spawning grounds is believed to be the dominant behavioral 

aspect of fish aggregation (Laevastu and Hayes, 1981).  Therefore, understanding migratory 

corridors and cues are essential for ecosystem-based management and conservation.  Earlier 

studies have highlighted the southwestern Atlantic Ocean as an important spawning ground for 

sailfish (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et al., 2009a). Limited tagging data prevent a 

characterization of the mechanisms affecting sailfish distribution, including the possible 

influence of environmental factors during important life-cycle events. Based on catch-effort 

statistics, SST it thought to significantly affect the horizontal distribution patterns of sailfish 

(Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Ovchinnikov, 1971). In addition, vertical movements may be limited by 

the concentration of dissolved oxygen, depth of the mixed-layer, or by an 8°C change in water 

temperature (Brill and Lutcavage, 2001).  For example, limited dissolved oxygen may act as a 



57 

 

barrier to constrain vertical movements in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (Prince and Goodyear, 

2006; Prince et al., 2010).  

Population dynamics models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity in vital 

biological parameters are needed to understand species distribution and impacts of commercial 

exploitation on stocks (Cadrin and Secor, 2009).  Due to significant gaps in the knowledge about 

sailfish biology and catch rates in the Atlantic, a study was undertaken to describe the spatio-

temporal pattern of sailfish abundance in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean. 

Moreover, key environmental variables were evaluated to determine the possible affect(s) on the 

distribution and catchability of sailfish during important life-cycle events. These analyses 

allowed us to address various aspects of the ecology of sailfish, particularly with inferences 

about the kinds of variables that influence sailfish distribution during spawning. 

4.2. Material and Methods 

4.2.1. Catch and effort data 

Data on catch and nominal fishing effort were obtained from logbooks of the 

Brazilian pelagic tuna longline fleet (national and chartered vessels) which were completed by 

fishing captains during trips from 2004 to 2008. The logbooks contain vessel identification, date, 

location of fishing ground (latitude and longitude), time of the longline set and retrieval, fishing 

effort in number of hooks and the number of fish caught by species.  

In order to have a homogenous data set, the analyses were limited to shallow (&amp;lt;

120 m), nighttime longline sets that targeted swordfish (n=18,395 sets). Deep daytime (&gt;200 m) 

sets that targeted tunas (n=1,936) were deleted. Longline sets were distributed throughout a wide 

area of the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from 7°N to 40°S and 50°W to 

0° (Figure 4.1). However, due to the low fishing effort and no sailfish catches below 35°S (33 

sets), the analysis was constrained to a narrower area, ranging from 7ºN to 35ºS and 50ºW to 

10ºW (18,362 sets) (Figure 4.1).  

4.2.2. Environmental data 

Time-series of SST (ºC), depth (m) of the mixed layer (DML) and zonal and 

meridional wind components were obtained from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active 



58 

 

Archive Center (PODAAC) - Jet Propulsion Laboratory/ NASA (2004-2008). Wind velocity 

(m/s) estimates were obtained for each fishing location from wind velocity = ? (meridional wind2 

+ zonal wind2). The bottom depth (m) at the deployment location was obtained from the National 

Geophysical Data Center (ETOPO5- Earth Topography 5 min) and data on chlorophyll-a 

concentrations (Chla) were obtained from SeaWiFS images, provided by the Goddard Space 

Flight Center/ NASA and converted to mg*m3. These data, with an original resolution of 0.5° × 

0.5° (except Chla with initial resolution of 9 km x 9 km resolution), were used to construct a 

database of 1° × 1° resolution assembled by day, month, year, latitude and longitude.  These data 

were then matched to the fisheries catch and effort data on the same temporal and spatial scale.  

4.2.3. Generalized additive model fitting procedures  

 Generalized additive models (GAMs) using penalized regression splines 

(estimated by penalized iterative least squares, Wood, 2006) were applied to predict areas with 

high catch rates. Data were separated into two distinct periods: (a) spawning (November to 

February) and; (b) non-spawning (March to October). The spawning period was determined 

based on the spatial differences of monthly mean gonadal index values and the non-spawning 

period was assumed to commence immediately after spawning within the study area (Figure 4.1) 

(Mourato et al., 2009). Since there was high correlation between SST and latitude (r = 0.83) and 

between bottom depth and longitude (r = 0.63), two kinds of models were used to avoid 

confounding issues with multiple collinearity (Maunder and Punt, 2004; Zuur et al., 2010): (1) 

“spatio-temporal”, included the factors year, month, latitude and longitude; and (2) 

“oceanographic” which included several environmental variables, as well as year, to account for 

inter-annual variability. Formulations of these models were: 

- Spatio-temporal model: 

catch ~ year + month + s(longitude, latitude) + offset(log[fishing effort]) + e 

- Oceanographic model: 

catch ~ year + s(wind) + s(bathymetry) + s(SST) + s(Chla) + s(DML) + 

offset(log[fishing effort]) + e; 



59 

 

where catch is the number of sailfish caught per set, s (longitude, latitude) represents the effect of 

the spatial location as an isotropic bivariate function (Wood and Augustin, 2002), fishing effort 

is an offset term, and e is an error term from any distribution from the exponential family. Two 

main parametric predictors (i.e. factors) were considered: year (n = 5 levels, 2004 thru 2008), 

and month (n = 4 levels, November thru February for the spawning period and; n = 8 levels, 

March thru October, for the non-spawning period). Models were fit using the mgcv package in R 

2.12.0  (R Development Core Team, 2010) with the optimum degree of smoothing being 

estimated by the generalized cross-validation (GCV) criterion (Wood, 2006).  

Due the high percentage of zeros in the catch data (~60%, sets with no sailfish 

catches), three statistical probability distributions were initially considered: Poisson, negative 

binomial and Tweedie. A Poisson distribution is a common approach to model spatio-temporal 

distributions of count data (Augustin et al., 1998) and the negative binomial GAMs were 

implemented using automatic selection of a scale parameter ? available in package mgcv (Wood, 

2006). For the Tweedie distribution, the estimation of the power-parameter was obtained by 

maximizing the likelihood for each value candidate (Dunn and Smith, 2005). The final 

estimation of this parameter was approximately 1.3 (compound Poisson-gamma distribution), 

which was considered appropriate for the analysis (Shono, 2008).  

The selection of predictors and the decision on their entry or exclusion was based 

on the GCV score, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1978) and the total deviance 

explained. However, in mgcv, fitting algorithms using GCV scores for negative binomial is not 

appropriate (Wood, 2006). Thus, for negative binomial models the selection of predictors was 

evaluated by AIC and the total deviance explained. Chi-square tests were also computed to 

determine whether predictors yielded significant (p &amp;lt;0.05) reductions in the residual deviance 

upon entry into the GAM. Lastly, selection of the best statistical probability distribution for the 

oceanographic and spatio-temporal models for each period (i.e. spawning or non-spawning) was 

based on distribution of residuals, lowest values of AIC and Bayesian Information Criterion 

(BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) and the total deviance explained.  

4.3. Results 

Of 18,362 sets analyzed, 6,492 sets corresponded to the spawning period and 

11,870 sets to the non-spawning period and the proportion of positive catches (sets with at least

60 

 

one sailfish caught) was 42% and 35% for the spawning and non-spawning periods, respectively. 

However, the proportion of positive catches varied over time with the highest proportions 

occurring in 2005 for the spawning period (53%), and 2004 for the non-spawning period (38%). 

The distribution of sailfish catch per set showed a highly skewed distribution, with high numbers 

of zeros and few observations of greater than five sailfish captured per set (Figure 4.2).  

4.3.1. Modeling 

For both the spawning and non-spawning periods, the results of the spatio-

temporal models indicated that the negative binomial distribution provided the best fit (Table 

4.1). The oceanographic model, using data from the spawning period, exhibited the lowest AIC 

and BIC scores (Table 4.1). However, during the non-spawning period, the best fit for the 

oceanographic model was provided by the Tweedie distribution. For all models, the traditional 

Poisson distribution had the highest AIC and BIC scores, in comparison with negative binomial 

and Tweedie models (Table 4.1). Though there were only small AIC and BIC differences 

between the negative binomial and the Tweedie models, the negative binomial oceanographic 

model explained a higher proportion of the deviance (18.0% vs 16.5%). Residuals from the 

negative binomial distribution (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4) showed a better fit in comparison with 

Tweedie and Poisson models and suggests no evidence of heteroscedacity.  Based on these 

criteria, all analyses were consequently based on the negative binomial distribution.  

4.3.2. Selection and significance of variables in the models 

All terms added to the spatio-temporal models for both the spawning period and 

the non-spawning period were highly statically significant (p &amp;lt;2.20-16) and resulted in a decrease 

in AIC value (Table 4.2). The isotropic bivariate s(longitude, latitude) term was the most 

important for both periods. For the spawning period, the effect of geographic location accounted 

for 31.6% of the explained deviance, while for the non-spawning period this contribution was 

26%. Other variables (month and year) were also significant, however with much lower 

explanatory power (Table 4.2). All terms added to the analysis of deviance for the oceanographic 

models were statistically significant (p &amp;lt;2.20-16) and resulted in greater resolving power (i.e. 

lower AIC value) (Table 4.3). For the spawning period; based on percentage deviance explained, 

wind velocity and ocean depth were the most important terms, followed by year, SST, Chla and 



61 

 

DML (Table 4.3).  By contrast, during the non-spawning period, SST was the most important 

factor. The inclusion of other oceanographic parameters in this model also resulted in a decrease 

of residual deviance with wind velocity being the most important factor, followed by Chla, 

bathymetry, year and DML (Table 4.3).  

4.3.3. Spatiotemporal trends of catch rates 

The spatial prediction (Figure 4.5 ) of sailfish catch rates for spawning and non-

spawning periods show spatio-temporal variation of sailfish densities in the South Atlantic. 

During the spawning period, three distinct areas of high densities were evident: (1)  the largest 

area was in a oceanic region, between  5°S and 15°S and 20°W and 30°W; (2) the second area 

was situated close to the southeastern coast of Brazil, between 15°S and 25°S and 39°W and 

50°W; and (3) the third area was from 0° to 5°S and from 39°W to 45°W (Figure 4.5). During 

the non-spawning period, the most prominent feature was the disappearance of sailfish from 

southeastern Brazil and the notable increase in catch in the more oceanic region of the South 

Atlantic, extending from 5°S to 20°S and from 18°W to 35°W (Figure 4.5). The high catch area 

close to the northern coast of Brazil was present in both periods with a slight north-west 

displacement during the non-spawning period.  

Standardized catch rates for all models and periods were very similar, except for 

the strong peak in 2005 in the spatio-temporal model during spawning. A moderate decline of 

standardized catch rates is evident for all models throughout the time period analysed in this 

study (Figure 4.6). The standard deviations of the year effects are provided in the Table 4.4. 

Monthly patterns show that sailfish abundance is expected to be high during the spawning period 

(November to January), followed by a strong decline in February (Figure 4.7). During the non-

spawning, sailfish abundance is highest during the months before and after the spawning season 

which coincides with warmer water temperatures (Figure 4.7).  

4.3.4. Environmental effects on catch rate 

Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 depict the smoothed terms from the oceanographic 

model during the spawning and non-spawning periods, respectively. During spawning, sailfish 

catch rates are expected to be highest when the wind velocity is higher than 4 m/s with the most 

pronounced peak ? 9 m/s (Figure 4.8) and a similar trend was also observed during the non-



62 

 

spawning period with higher catch rates associated with higher wind velocities (Figure 4.9). As 

expected, the influence of bottom depth on sailfish catch rate was different between spawning 

and non-spawning periods. During spawning, higher catch rates were associated with coastal 

areas (&amp;lt;2000 m, Figure 4.8), especially off southeastern of Brazil (Figure 4.5). However, high 

catch rates were also noted in waters greater than 5000 m deep (Figure 4.8), which may be 

associated with a different water mass, between 5°S and 15°S (Figure 4.5). In the non-spawning 

period, the effect of variability in bottom depth indicated sailfish were more concentrated in 

waters greater than 3500 m deep (Figure 4.9) as shown by the distribution maps (Figure 4.5). 

 The influence of SST on sailfish abundance was similar for the two periods, with 

the highest catch rates occurring when SST was &gt;26°C (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9). Off all 

factors examined, however, SST was the most important variable to explain distribution of 

sailfish catch rates for non-spawning activities, while during spawning, wind velocity was the 

most prominent variable (Table 4.3). Sailfish catch rate were similar between spawning and non-

spawning periods regarding chlprophyll a concentrations with the highest values in the range 

between 0.6 and 1.0 mg*m3, followed by a decline thereafter (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9).  

4.4. Discussion 

In an effort to understand variability in sailfish catch rates in the western and 

south Atlantic, various GAMs were investigated to analyze the spatio-temporal trends in catch 

with spawning seasonality and environmental factors incorporated into models.  Moreover, also 

linked to models was a spatially explicit gonadal index value (to assess reproductive activity) 

(Mourato et al., 2009a).  By matching catch statistics with biological and environmental factors 

on the same scale, our analysis suggested a new insight about the spatio-temporal catch 

variability of sailfish in southwestern Atlantic and the factors that influence catchability and 

availability of sailfish associated with pelagic longline fishery. 

4.4.1. Modeling approach 

The negative binomial distribution appeared to be the most appropriate 

distribution to analyze sailfish catch rates caught by the Brazilian longline fleet based on 

distribution of residuals, AIC, and percentage of deviance explained. Due to high correlation 

between SST and latitude and between bottom depth and longitude, we fitted models with spatial 



63 

 

and environmental predictors separately to avoid problems with collinearity. When SST and 

bottom depth were fit in a single model, the results were non-intuitive as higher sailfish catch 

rates were associated with lower SST (&lt;18°C), but this species has been described by several 

authors to prefer warmer waters ranging from 24° to 30°C (Ovchinikov, 1971; Beardsley et al., 

1975; Nakamura, 1985). The unrealistic effect of SST, however, is probably related to problems 

of concurvity, a common problem in GAM modeling. Concurvity is the non-parametric analogue 

of colinearity where the effect of one of the predictors (e.g. SST) can be approximated by a 

linear combination of the effects of other predictors (i.e. latitude) (Ramsay et al., 2003; Figueiras 

et al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2006). For these reasons, the separate treatment of environmental 

parameters from the spatial parameters was crucial to better assess the effects of environmental 

effects on the spatio-temporal distribution of sailfish catch rates, as well as to avoid bias caused 

by over parameterization. 

4.4.2. Spatiotemporal trends of catch rates  

Previous authors have reported that the southeast Brazilian coast is an important 

spawning area for sailfish from December to February (Arfelli and Amorim, 1981; Mourato et 

al., 2009).  The observations in our study also provide evidence of a major spawning ground in 

the south Atlantic. Moreover, based on relatively high densities and low gonadal index values 

throughout the year (Mourato et al., 2009a), the mid-west Atlantic (i.e. south of 15°S), as well as 

the north coast of Brazil may represent important winter feeding grounds areas. Additionally, our 

findings are also supported by Mourato et al. (2010a) which showed that the proportion of adults 

on the three hotspots indentified in the present study is much higher than juveniles or sub-adults 

proportion and the average size of the specimens caught by the Brazilian pelagic longline fishery 

on these aforementioned areas is higher than the length of sexual maturity estimated for sailfish 

in the southwestern Atlantic. Hence we may consider that the specimens caught in these areas are 

able to reproduce.  

Based on the reproductive data and catch rate analyses, it can be hypothesized that 

starting in October, mature sailfish migrate from the western central tropical Atlantic towards the 

southeast Brazilian coast to spawn and remain in the area from about February to March. After 

spawning, sailfish probably migrate in a north-east direction perhaps following the south Atlantic 

gyre (Peterson and Stramma, 1991), to return to the tropical western central tropical Atlantic to 



64 

 

forage.  Pop-up satellite archival tagging of two sailfish indicated that fish may remain off 

southeastern coast of Brazil during the spawning season for periods up to one month (Mourato et 

al., 2010b).  

4.4.3. Impact of environmental factors 

The spatio-temporal models had better explanatory ability to explain variability of 

sailfish catch rates than oceanographic models. A lower explanatory ability and a larger residual 

deviance of the oceanographic models were, however, not unexpected, since the inclusion of 

environmental variables in the modeling of species distribution can be problematic (Brill and 

Lutcavage, 2001) when remotely sensed predictor variables represent averages over time and 

space. The relationship between environmental variables and sailfish relative abundance, 

however, may help explain habitat preferences during spawning.  

Results showed that sailfish were caught over a large SST range (16 ? 29°C) and 

higher densities were associated with warmer waters (&gt;26°C) during both spawning and non-

spawning periods. It is thought that during September to October, sailfish migrate southward 

prior to spawning, and afterwards they migrate to the north-east.  Changes in catch and sailfish 

distribution were probably related to seasonal changes in SST, and in particular, the 

displacement of 28°C surface isotherm during these movements. Temperature strongly 

influences fish metabolism and during spawning, may accelerate the process of gonadal 

development (Freon and Misund 1999). Several authors described that sailfish migration was 

probably restricted to the 28°C surface isotherm in several parts of the world (Ovchinnikov, 

1971; Ueyanagi et al., 1970; Nakamura 1985). Furthermore, information from satellite tagging 

also suggested the preference of sailfish for warm waters of the uniform surface mixed-layer 

(Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Mourato et al., 2010b).  

The appearance of sailfish on spawning grounds and in fisheries off southeast 

Brazil may be related to the oceanographic conditions that prevail during warm periods. The 

intrusion of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) during summer over the continental shelf and 

slope may be related to sailfish reproduction in the southwestern Atlantic. The SACW is 

characterized by temperatures lower than 18°C, salinity ranging between 34.4 and 36 ppt and a 

high concentration of nutrients (Matsuura, 1986). The seasonal expansion of the SACW 



65 

 

promotes an influx of deep nutrients to the shallow parts of water column and consequently may 

accumulate large concentrations of potential prey items for sailfish larvae, juveniles and adults. 

On the other hand, there is currently no evidence of a fishery oceanographic relationship that 

could help explain the high sailfish densities observed in more oceanic areas between 5°S and 

15°S and in the area close to the northern coast of Brazil.  

Despite the preference of sailfish for warmer waters, which are usually more 

oligotrophic, the higher band of chlorophyll concentration (&gt;0.9 mg*m3) had a negative effect on 

the catch rate. This might be explained by the time needed for the chlorophyll bloom to mature 

into forage for sailfish, such as squid and small pelagic fish. Similar patterns were also observed 

for blue shark in the southwest Atlantic (Mourato et al., 2008) and albacore in the northwest 

Pacific (Laurs, 1983).  For example, Lehodey et al. (1998) suggest it takes about 3 months for a 

chlorophyll bloom to mature into forage for skipjack tuna in the equatorial Pacific. 

Wind velocity may also affect the availability and vulnerability of sailfish, as well 

as the behavior of the longline. The higher sailfish catch rates associated with high wind 

velocities may be an indirect result of other operational variables related to the behavior of the 

fishing gear in the water column. For example, higher wind stress may induce greater vertical 

hook movements, which would increase sailfish vulnerability to the baited hooks. Higher wind 

velocities associated with higher current velocities, for instance, may shoal and therefore reduce 

the fishing depth of the pelagic longline gear by ?50% (Bigelow et al., 2006).  Similar longline 

shoaling may occur in the western equatorial Atlantic (B.L. Mourato, unpublished data), thus 

increasing sailfish vulnerability given the reported shallow vertical distribution based on free-

ranging animals (Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Mourato et al., 2010b). 

Identification of spawning areas in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean will be useful for delineating 

stock structure of sailfish in the Atlantic. Furthermore, areas of high catch rates could be 

included in models that may prove valuable for catch rate standardizations which in turn could 

provide information on catchability.  

The inclusion of oceanographic variables in catch rate standardization, however, 

had a small statistical benefit since the standardized catch rates were very similar to spatial-

temporal models. On the other hand, the oceanographic models provided a better understanding 

of fishery oceanographic relationships, the physiological ecology of sailfish and the possible 



66 

 

relationship between the fishing gear behavior and catchability (e.g., wind velocity effect). New 

applications incorporating other oceanographic variables (e.g., dissolved oxygen) are still 

required to improve the understanding of the environmental effects on sailfish catches. Finally, 

the fishery oceanographic relationships presented herein should also be tested and developed in 

other areas with sailfish fisheries in order to better evaluate the benefits of the inclusion of 

environmental factors on catch rate standardization.

Chapter 5 - Movements and habitat utilization 
of Atlantic sailfish off Southeast Brazil, 
determined by pop-up satellite tagging 
Abstract 

Information about habitat selection and migration pattern of highly migratory 

species like tunas and billfishes are of primary interest in stock assessment and management, 

since that they are key factors in the identification of stock units. PSATs were deployed on four 

sailfish in the coastal waters of Rio de Janeiro State located in Southeast Brazilian coast during 

January and February of 2009 (for the tags sailfish I and sailfish II) and between November 2010 

and January 2011 (for the tags sailfish III and sailfish IV).  Wildlife Computers Inc MK10 PAT 

model were the tags used. The total number of days monitored (such as the time that the tags 

remained attached) were 12 (sailfish I), 51 (sailfish II), 16 (sailfish III) and 43 days (sailfish IV). 

In brief, the results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat utilization of sailfish, with the 

majority of the time spent being predominantly concentrated near the sea surface with a 

relatively narrow temperature range preference. Despite the preference for surface waters the 

tagged sailfish demonstrated vertical movements into deeper waters (around 50 m depth) 

regularly within 3 to 6 hour interval. In brief, the “most probable tracks” suggest that tagged 

sailfish did not move significantly away from the tagging site. Sailfish I moved southeastward 

away from the Brazilian coast until the 7th day of liberty, presenting, after that, a westward 

movement towards the Brazilian coast, until the pop-up event, very close of the tagging site. 

Sailfish II moved towards southeast farther away from the Brazilian coast with the position of 

the first transmission of tag relatively not too far from the tagging site. Sailfish III showed 

relatively meandering moving behavior however with the position of the first transmission of tag 

being relatively close to the coast. Sailfish IV moved initially southward, presenting 

subsequently an eastward movement farther away from the Brazilian coast, but returning towards 

the continent, until the pop-up event.

5.1. Introduction 

Information about habitat selection and migration of highly migratory species, like 

tunas and billfishes, is of primary interest for stock assessment and management, since they are 

key factors in the identification of stock units. The distribution and time variability at different 

scales (i.e. circadian, seasonal, interannual) of fish stocks help to delineate how many fisheries 

are exploiting a given stock and conversely how many stocks a given fishery is exploiting (Fréon 

and Misund, 1999). Furthermore, the habitat utilization and movements also govern the 

availability of fish in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, thus directly affecting the 

catchability coefficient and consequently the catch rates (Fréon and Misund, 1999, Bigelow and 

Maunder 2007). Therefore, it is indispensable that these factors be taken into account in the 

development of abundance indices for stock assessments purposes and related management 

advice.  

However, the gathering of information on migration and habitat selection of large 

pelagic fish has always presented several challenging obstacles. Traditionally, information on 

spatiotemporal variability of fish stocks has been obtained by analysis of catch-per-unit-effort 

(CPUE) from commercial fisheries. However, the use of nominal CPUE to estimate abundance 

has been criticized for a long time (Garstang, 1900; Baranov, 1918; Ricker, 1940; Mar, 1953), 

since the basic assumptions (e.g., fish and fishing effort are randomly distributed) are rarely met 

(Hilborn and Walters, 1992).  

On the other hand, the practice of fish tagging has provided valuable information 

about fish movements and distribution, particularly because of its “fisheries-independent” nature. 

The first tagging experiments on billfishes took place in the early 50s, through a cooperative 

tagging program operating out of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, in Massachusetts (USA). 

During this program, between 1954 and 1960, 1,305 sailfish and 1,500 white marlins were 

tagged (Mather, 1963). Few years later, by 1965, around 6,793 sailfish had already been tagged. 

In the other side of the USA, in the Pacific Ocean, extensive billfish tagging were also 

happening. During the first International Billfish Symposium held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 

(USA), in 1972, the results of 15,540 billfish tagged in that ocean were also reported. An 

extensive literature review on the application of conventional tagging in large teleosts, including 

tuna and tuna-like fishes is available in Bayliff (1993, 1996) and Ortiz et al. (2003).  



82 

 

Despite of its great utility for the understanding of fish longevity and movements, 

conventional tagging studies are rather limited, since they provide only fish positions at release 

and recapture. The actual track taken by the fish between these two points, as well as its daily 

vertical movements, are therefore impossible to infer. Besides, conventional tagging depends 

directly on fishing to recover the tagged fish. In the mid-1950s, however, the underwater 

telemetry in form of acoustic tags began to allow fishery biologists to actually follow individual 

fish over several days, making it possible to describe their behavior and simultaneously to collect 

data about the surrounding physical environment (Arnold and Dewar 2001).  

The first experiment of acoustic telemetry on sailfish was conducted by Jolley and 

Irby (1979) off the east coast of Florida (USA), aiming at the assessment of the pos-release 

mortality of eight tagged sailfish. Since then, technological advances, such as the reduction in 

size and weight of the acoustic tags, as well as the increase of battery life and signal strength 

(Reine, 2005), have allowed the application of telemetry studies in several billfishes, including 

striped marlin (Holts and Bedford, 1990; Brill et al., 1993), blue marlin (Holland et al., 1990; 

Block et al. 1992a and b), black marlin (Pepperell and Davis, 1999), and swordfish (Carey and 

Robison, 1981; Carey, 1990). More recently Hoolihan (2004) utilized acoustic telemetry to 

investigate the small scale movements of sailfish in the Arabian Gulf, showing that the depth 

distribution of this specie is predominantly superficial with more than 84.3% of its time being 

spent in the first 10m. 

Despite the importance of acoustic telemetry to the advance on the knowledge of 

vertical and horizontal movements of fish, this technique still has some limitations, since it 

requires the active following of the tagged animal. The length of observation on active acoustic 

telemetry is therefore usually restricted to relatively short periods of time (few days), restrained 

by vessel autonomy, crew fatigue and tag battery life. The advent of the automatic pop-up tags in 

the late 1990s, however, gave a new impulse to the research on the migratory movements of 

marine animals.  

The pop-up tags record data on ambient light levels, which can be analyzed with 

daily geolocations algorithms to determine the geographic position during the track period, depth 

and water temperature. Basically, the pop-up tags continuously record data for a predetermined 

period and set intervals, automatically detaching  itself from the fish when this period it attained. 



83 

 

It then floats to the sea surface and transmit all stored data by satellite through the ARGOS 

System (Worldwide Tracking and Environmental Monitoring by Satellite). The most beneficial 

feature of this innovative technology in comparison to the acoustic telemetry is the possibility of 

a long-term monitoring (months to years) of marine animals (Arnold and Dewar, 2001). 

Moreover, the pop-up tags are “fisheries independent” which means that the recapture of the 

animal is not necessary. This is a very important characteristic since that the recapture rates in 

some remote locations might be very low. Furthermore, this technology also allows the tracking 

of species, such as marine mammals and turtles, which are not targeted by fishery operations.  

The first studies on scombrid fish using pop-up tag were done on the Atlantic 

bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) (Block et al., 1998, Lutcavage et al., 2000). The first study with 

pop-up tags in billfishes were conducted by Graves et al. (2000) to understand the mechanisms 

that affect the post-release survival of Atlantic blue marlin after capture with recreational fishing 

gears. The first experiment with pop-up tags in a sailfish, was conducted by Hoolihan (2004) in 

the Gulf of Arabia. Prince and Goodyear (2006) also deployed pop-up tags in sailfish and blue 

marlins in the Northwestern Atlantic and in the Eastern Central Pacific to assess and compare the 

vertical distribution of these species in these two oceans. Few years later, Hoolihan and Luo 

(2007) provided detailed information of 18 sailfish tagged with pop-up tags to assess the summer 

residence of the species the in the Gulf of Arabia. Studies of post-release mortality estimates for 

sailfish with pop-up tags were later conducted Kerstetter and Graves (2008) based on pelagic 

longline fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. More recently, Hoolihan et al. (2009) also provided 

detailed information about vertical movements of sailfish in the western North Atlantic, based on 

two recovered pop-up tags.  

In this context, in the present chapter the satellite telemetry technology was 

utilized in order to better understand and determine the summer presence, residence time and 

movements of sailfish during and after spawning season in southeast Brazilian coast. 

5.2. Material and Methods 

5.2.1. Field Operation and PSAT tag programming  

PSATs were deployed on four sailfish in the coastal waters of Rio de Janeiro State 

located in Southeast Brazil during January and February of 2009 (for tagged sailfish I and 



84 

 

sailfish II) and between November 2010 and January 2011 (for tagged sailfish III and sailfish 

IV).  Wildlife Computers Inc (Redmond, WA, USA) MK10 PAT tags were used. The tags were 

programmed to record depth, temperature and light intensity every second. The depth and 

temperature records were compiled into histograms at 3-hour intervals (for sailfish I and sailfish 

II) and at 6-hour intervals (for sailfish III and sailfish IV), with sampling every 60 s. The 

minimum and maximum temperature bins were programmed for temperatures ?12°C and ?30°C, 

while the depth bins were programmed to sample the minimum depth of ? 1 m (or 0) and 

maximum depth of 300 m. These bins were chosen based on the vertical movement behavior of 

sailfish in other areas (Hoolihan, 2004, Prince and Goodyear, 2006). The data collected included 

the minimum and maximum temperature and depth, and amount of time spent in each of 13 

specified depth and temperature bins for each sampled interval (Table 5.1).  

The pop-up tags were programmed for a deployment period of 60 days (sailfish I 

and sailfish II) and 140 days (sailfish III and sailfish IV). A pressure-activated mechanical 

detachment device was also used, to prevent data loss in the event of fish mortality, remaining at 

constant depth or going over 1000m. Release locations were obtained from global positioning 

systems onboard the tagging vessel and pop-up locations were obtained directly from the 

ARGOS transmissions. The tags were prepared with a tether made of nylon monofilament with ? 

16-20 cm of length. To alleviate torque forces, a swivel was placed halfway along the tether 

(Figure 5.1).  

Deployment of pop-up tags was conducted from recreational fishing vessels using 

standard trolling gear with natural bait and titanium circle hooks in order to increase the chances 

of survival of tagged fish. Once fish were hooked and brought to leader and reeled close to the 

boat, the tag was deployed. The tagging target area was a little below the base of the dorsal fin, 

between the interneural and neural spines (Musyl and Naughton, 2007, Figure 5.2). The PSAT 

tags were anchored by a harpoon equipped with a stainless steel tag applicator modified to be 

driven 5-7 cm into the dorsal musculature. Prior to release, individual weights and lengths were 

estimated.  



85 

 

5.2.2. Horizontal distribution 

Light intensity records were pre-processed using the global positioning software 

WC-GPE (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA) to get the daily raw geo-locations (i.e. 

unfiltered and uncorrected estimates) of tagged fish for each day at liberty. Then, the Kalman 

Filter State-Space Model (KFTRACK) (Sibert et al., 2003) was applied to predict the most 

probable track of the tagged fish. The KFTRACK model was fitted using the “KFTRACK 

package” (http://www.nielsensweb.org/ukfsst/).  

5.2.3. Vertical distribution 

After running the KFTRACK algorithm, the daily geographical position of the 

tagged fish was used to estimate the times of sunrise, sunset, and local noon using standard 

astronomical formulae (Duffett-Smith, 1988). Then the local sunrise and sunset at estimated 

longitudes were used to assign three distinct periods (day, night and transition) to the data. 

Although most works on satellite telemetry have used only day and night periods, the transition 

period was necessary in the present study since the tags were programmed to compile data into 

histograms at 3-hour intervals (e.g. for sailfish I and II, from 5AM to 8AM and from 5PM to 

8PM). For sailfish III and IV, however, this procedure was not needed since the tags were 

programmed to compile data into histograms at 6-hour intervals, requiring the assignment of 

only night and day periods.  

After assigning the period of the day to the data, a chi-square goodness-of-fit test 

(G-test) was applied to evaluate the independence between the temperature and depth 

distributions within and among tags. All statistical tests were performed at the p = 0.05 level of 

significance. Furthermore in order to look for similarities between periods and tags, the 

frequency distributions of the proportion of time at depth and temperature were formatted into an 

input matrix to apply a non-hierarchical cluster analysis (based on euclidean distances and 

“ward” method).  

The proportions of records within successively deeper layers of temperature, 

relative to the temperature of the surface mixed layer (termed Delta T; Goodyear et al., 2008) by 

each 3 h (sailfish I e II) or 6 h (sailfish III e IV) intervals were also calculated for the period that 

could be clearly identified as day, night or transition time. Average daily surface temperature 

http://www.nielsensweb.org/ukfsst/


86 

 

was calculated by extracting the temperatures from PDT data where depth was ? 10 m. Delta T 

values were then calculated by subtracting the mean temperature of each PDT observation from 

the generated average daily temperature values and tabulating the proportion of time spent at 

temperatures using 1°C bin resolution. 

5.3. Results 

5.3.1. Tag deployments and performance 

The estimated sizes and weights of the tagged fish ranged were from 135 to 

165 cm (Eye-Fork length - EFL) and from 20 to 30 kg. Fish were hooked in the mouth and 

appeared in good condition when released. However, all sailfish lost their PSAT prematurely and 

began transmitting data before the expected dates (60 or 140 days after deployment). The total 

number of days monitored (i.e. the period of time the tags remained attached) were 12 (sailfish 

I), 51 (sailfish II), 16 (sailfish III) and 43 days (sailfish IV). However, the total percentage of 

data successfully transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system was 82%, 75%, 46% and 

12.5% of the total archived data for the tags I, II, III and IV, respectively. The geographical 

positions (raw geolocations) were obtained for only 63 days (sailfish I: 12 days; sailfish II: 21 

days; sailfish III: 18 days; and sailfish IV: 12 days). 

5.3.2. Vertical habitat use and temperature preference 

The results indicate a clear pattern of vertical habitat utilization of sailfish, with 

the majority of the time being spent near the sea surface with a relatively narrow temperature 

range preference. Sailfish I spent 67%, 90% and 81% between 0 and 10 m, during day, night and 

transition periods, respectively, while sailfish II spent 72%, 69% and 66%, in the same depth 

stratum and periods (Figure 5.3). Sailfish III spent 73% and 64% between 0 and 10 m during day 

and night periods, respectively, while sailfish IV spent 72% and 54% in the same depth stratum 

and periods (Figure 5.3). 

Sailfish I remained in waters with temperatures between 25° and 28°C for 90% of 

day time, 87% of night time and 77% of transition time (Figure 5.4), while sailfish II remained 

between 25° and 28°C, for 77%, 73% and 74% of day, night and transition periods, respectively 

(Figure 5.4). Sailfish III spent more time in a bit cooler waters, with temperature ranging from 



87 

 

24° to 27°C for 89% and 82% during day and night time respectively (Figure 5.4). Sailfish IV, in 

turn, had a similar behavior of sailfish I and II, remaining in waters with temperatures between 

25° and 28°C for 90% of day time and 69% of night time (Figure 5.4).  

The cumulative depth and temperature frequencies plots are also similar for the 

tagged specimens indicating the species preference for surface layers, with temperatures ranging 

from 24° to 28°C (Figure 5.5). Delta T frequency distributions showed that all sailfish spent the 

vast majority of their time in the uniform temperature surface layer, being exposed to a 

maximum temperature change of ~8-10° C (Figure 5.6). 

None of the heterogeneity chi-square analyses using the G-test for the time at 

depth distributions (44 total tests) provided significantly different results among periods for each 

fish, as well as for the data combined (data of all fishes). Likewise, none of the results of G-test 

for time at temperature distributions (44 total tests) were significantly different among periods 

for each fish, or for the data combined. Additionally, the resultant clustering dendrogram for 

depth and temperature distribution showed some similarities between the analyzed specimens 

and periods (Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7).  

The depth readings by 3-hour (sailfish I e II) or 6-hour (sailfish III e IV) intervals 

during the monitored time for all tagged sailfish (Figure 5.8; Table 5.2) show that, despite their 

preference for surface waters, all sailfish performed vertical movement into deeper waters 

(around 50 m depth) regularly within 3 or 6 hour interval (Figure 5.8). However, in general, 

sailfish I and III made shallower dives (around 50 m depth), when compared to sailfish II and IV, 

which frequently visited deeper depths, around 100 m. Furthermore, the two deepest dives made 

by sailfish I (120 m) were observed immediately after release (Figure 5.8, Table 5.2). For sailfish 

II the deepest observed dives reached 376 m, while sailfish III made its deepest dive at 112 m. 

Sailfish IV presented, however, a much deeper dive, going down to 560 m (Figure 5.8, Table 

5.2). The depth records by period suggest that the average depths for all tagged sailfish were 

close (approximately between 20 and 30 m depth), although sailfish IV had an average depth of 

46 m during night time (Figure 5.9, Table 5.2 ).  

The minimum and maximum daily temperature and depth experienced by the 

tracked sailfish (Figure 5.10, Figure 5.11and Figure 5.12) (except for sailfish IV) show that 

sailfish I spent most of the time in waters above 20°C (average depth of 40m) with only two 



88 

 

dives on February 2th to waters with temperature of 16°C (120m, Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.10, 

Table 5.2). On the other hand, sailfish II experienced temperatures and depths much cooler and 

deeper than sailfish I, with a minimum temperature value of 11.1°C during its deepest dive 

(376m) on February 25th (Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.11, Table 5.2 ).  Sailfish III, in turn, had a 

similar behavior of sailfish I, spending most of the time in waters above 23°C (average depth of 

40m), with two dives on November 25th to waters with temperature of 20°C (120m, Figure 5.8 

and Figure 5.12, Table 5.2 ). Due to significant gaps on data transmission of the tag from sailfish 

IV this analysis could not be done for this specimen. However, it experienced the lowest 

temperature of 12.40°C during its deepest dive at 560 m (Table 5.2).  

After February 24th, and more specifically between February 25th and March 

10th, sailfish II presented minimum daily temperatures notably much cooler than the rest of the 

tracked period (Figure 5.11). This may indicate that the fish moved into a different and cooler 

water mass. Depth-temperature profiles also provide indications that the sailfish II swam at least 

in two different water masses (Figure 5.13).The first water mass occupied by the sailfish II, prior 

to 25th February, was warmer and had a deeper mixed layer, while from 25th February to 10th 

March the fish occupied a cooler water mass with a shallower mixed layer (Figure 5.13). The 

other 3 fishes, however, were associated to only warmer water masses during their whole track 

with apparently the same depth of mixed layer (Figure 5.13).  

In order to check if the depth behavior of sailfish II was different between the two 

water masses, the depth distribution data were split into two distinct periods. The first one related 

to the time the fish was associated to the warmer water mass and the second one related to the 

cooler water mass. While in the warmer water mass, the fish spent 72%, 65% and 62% of the 

day, night and transition time, respectively, in the upper 10 m, in the cooler water mass, the fish 

spent 77%, 75%, 75% of the day, night and transition time in the same depth layer (Figure 5.14). 

Moreover, while in the warmer water mass sailfish II spent 20% of the time (three periods 

combined) between 30 and 100 m depth, in the cooler water mass this percentage was only 7% 

(Figure 5.14). Furthermore, the maximum daily depths when the fish moved into the cooler 

water mass were notably smaller (around 50 m depth) in comparison to the rest of tracked period 

(around 100m depth) (Figure 5.11). Nevertheless, the depth distribution of sailfish II in the two 

water masses were not significantly different (G-test, p &gt; 0.05).  



89 

 

5.3.3. Horizontal movements 

The estimated parameters of KFTRACK model for all sailfish (Table 5.3), as well 

as the geolocation estimates (Figure 5.15 to Figure 5.18) indicate that the KFTRACK model was 

able to estimate a more reliable fish track than the manufacturer geolocation. The model 

corrected the raw values of longitude and latitude, especially for latitude since some positions 

fell completely outside of the confidence area (i.e. 95% confidence interval estimated by the 

model) (Figure 5.15 to Figure 5.18). In the case of sailfish II, an extreme raw geolocation latitude 

position (around 40° N) was recorded, corresponding to the equinox (when the latitude error is 

maximal) (Figure 5.16). Regarding the longitudes estimates, with a few exceptions, the raw 

geolocations were placed outside of the confidence interval of the KFTRACK model (Figure 

5.16).  

For sailfish III all positions were completely outside of the expected since the raw 

geolocations were positioned over the continent (Figure 5.17). The raw latitudes estimates were 

all outside of the confidence area while the longitude estimates lied reasonably inside it. This 

problem was solved fixing the release and pop-up positions (Figure 5.17). For sailfish IV, despite 

the light levels readings were not satisfactorily added to the model, due to the significant gaps in 

data transmission, the KFTRACK model seems to have reasonably estimated the most probable 

track (Figure 5.18). The confidence area for longitude estimates was very narrow while for 

latitude estimates the model fit much better, correcting, for example, an extreme raw latitude 

position on the 30th day of liberty (Figure 5.18).  

The “most probable tracks” suggest that all tagged sailfish did not move 

significantly away from the tagging site. Sailfish I moved southeastward away from the Brazilian 

coast until the 7th day of liberty, presenting, after that, a westward movement towards Brazilian 

coast until the pop-up event very close of the tagging site (Figure 5.15). Sailfish II moved 

towards southeast farther away from Brazilian coast with the position of the first transmission 

also relatively not too far from the tagging site (Figure 5.16). Sailfish III showed a kind of 

meandering movement, with the position of the first transmission, however, being relatively 

close to the coast (Figure 5.17). Sailfish IV moved first towards south, presenting, then, an 

eastward movement farther away from the Brazilian coast, but returning towards the continent 

until the pop-up event (Figure 5.18).

5.4. Discussion 

5.4.1. Tag performance 

In the present study all sailfish lost their tags prematurely, on average, at around 

30% of the programmed attachment time. The results suggest that the pop-up event occurred 

while the fish were alive and not as a result of death followed by sinking. Besides, all tagged 

specimens were large enough to carry a pop-up tag and were released in good condition, with the 

hooks being removed before release. The hypothesis of death due to the trauma resulting from 

the interaction with the fishing gear is therefore unlikely. Moreover, estimates of post release 

survival also indicate that sailfish have a high survival rate after capture by pelagic longline 

fishing gears (Kerstetter and Graves, 2008), which is probably even more traumatic than the 

recreational fishing gear used in the present case. According to Musyl et al (2011), probable 

causes of tag failure and premature release include battery failure, antennae damage, increased 

drag as a result of biofouling, infections and tissue necrosis around the tagging site and 

interference on the frequency reserved to the ARGOS satellite system.  

Although the exact reasons for the premature releases observed in this study are 

not clear, the kind of the tagheads used and the site of tagging may have been a contributing 

factor. The regular nylon tagheads, used in the present work, have a low retention rate (Musyl 

and Naughton, 2007). Besides, according to the same authors, in order to maximize the retention 

time of the tags, the surface area of the tagheads should be increased and placed between 

adjacent interneural and neural spines (see Figure 5.2), near to the basis of the dorsal fin. All 

sailfish in this study, therefore, may have been tagged a little lower than the proper target area 

(see Figure 5.1).  

5.4.2. Vertical distribution 

The present results showed a marked preference of the tagged sailfish for the 

upper 10m of the water column during any time of the day. This pattern is consistent with 

previous studies with acoustic and pop-up tags on sailfish in other parts of world (Hoolihan, 

2004; Hoolihan and Luo, 2007; Prince and Goodyear, 2006; Kerstetter and Graves, 2008; Chiang 

et al., 2010).  



91 

 

The tagged sailfish also seemed to have a rather narrow temperature distribution. 

Delta T results showed a marked preference of sailfish for the warmer waters of the mixed layer, 

with all sailfish having spent less than 3% of their time in waters colder than 8°C relative to the 

change in water temperature in relation to the surface temperature. Other studies have also 

shown a restricted temperature range for the species, in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Prince 

and Goodyear, 2006; Hoolihan et al., 2011).  

The clear sailfish preference for near-surface warm waters is shared by other 

istiophorid billfish as well, including the black marlin in the Coral Sea (Pepperell and Davis, 

1999; Gunn et al.,2003), Atlantic blue marlin (Graves et al., 2002; Kerstetter et al., 2003; Prince 

and Goodyear, 2006; Goodyear et al., 2008), Pacific blue marlin (Holland et al., 1990; Block et 

al., 1992), and striped marlin (Holts and Bedford, 1990; Brill et al., 1993).  

The present results also showed that the tagged sailfish did not exhibit much depth 

variability in habitat use, although some variation was noticeable among individuals, as indicated 

by the cluster analysis. This pattern is consistent with the results reported for sailfish in Gulf of 

Arabia by Hoolihan and Luo (2007). On the other hand, Goodyear et al. (2008), analyzing a 

large database of 51 pop-up tags deployed in Atlantic blue marlin, found a complex behavior of 

vertical habitat use for this species. Musyl et al. (2003) also reported a complex habitat 

utilization for bigeye tuna in the north Pacific ocean with a clear difference in its behavior 

between night and day.  

Although the majority of the time spent by sailfish was restricted to warmer 

waters near the surface, the data showed that this species is also capable of making frequent deep 

dives, exceeding depths between 50 and 100 m, with the deepest one having exceeded 500 m. 

The depth and temperature histograms of time spent combined with the 3 or 6 hourly of 

maximum depth and minimum temperature suggests that the movement between the surface and 

deeper layers was relatively rapid. 

Vertical movement patterns in large pelagic fish has been reported as very 

complex reflecting behaviors such as foraging, thermoregulation or predator avoidance (Brill and 

Lutcavage, 2001). The sailfish dives observed in the present study may be related to an 

opportunistic feeding behavior. Although the pop-up tags technology does not allow the study of 

feeding events, two particularities of the sailfish biology seem to support this hypothesis. The 



92 

 

first one, of physiological and anatomical nature, is related to the fact that sailfish, like other 

istiophorids, have a specialized eye/ brain heater organ, allowing these deeper dives (Block, 

1986). The second one is related to stomach content analyses done in the same region, which 

show the presence of some mesopelagic species in their diet (Vaske-Júnior et al., 2004; Vaske-

Júnior, 2005). However, since the summarized pop-up data are not particularly useful for 

discriminating between different behaviors, these results need to be interpreted with caution. 

Analysis of high resolution data are still needed in order to allow a better understanding of the 

vertical movements of the species in a finer scale (i.e. at each minute or even though at each 

second).  

The results of the present study also suggest that the ambient temperature might 

be the dominant factor controlling the vertical distribution of the species. Sailfish II moved 

between two water masses with distinct thermal profiles and mixed layer depths, but after 

entering into the cooler water mass, the fish modified its depth behavior, reducing its average 

and maximum daily depth, the depth and frequency of dives and the time spent in deeper waters. 

Therefore, the depth of the mixed layer may be an important feature that might directly affect the 

depth behavior of sailfish. However, other oceanographic features have also been shown to affect 

the depth behavior of pelagic fishes. Prince and Goodyear (2006), for example, demonstrated 

that the vertical distribution of sailfish and blue marlin is directly related to the amount of 

dissolved oxygen, which may act as a physical barrier to their vertical movement, at least in the 

eastern side of the Atlantic. Considering, however, the much higher concentrations of dissolved 

oxygen in the western side of this ocean, such influence is unlikely in the present case.  

Some inferences regarding changes in catchability can be drawn from the vertical 

distributions of sailfish. Based on present results, this species tends to spend more time in 

shallow waters. The average depth of the shallow-set longline used by the Brazilian longline 

fishery targeting swordfish is ~50 m. Thus, it is very likely that sailfish vertical distribution is 

overlapping with the longline gear off the southeastern Brazilian coast. However, it is difficult to 

predict catchability from electronic tagging data since no information exits regarding how 

behavior may be altered by the presence of fishing gear.  

 



93 

 

5.4.3. Horizontal movements 

In general, sailfish has been recognized to be one of the istiophorid species that 

presents the most restricted movements in the Atlantic Ocean, as revealed by the release-

recovery vector of tagged recaptured fish, with no trans-Atlantic, trans-equatorial or 

intercontinental movements (Ortiz et al., 2003). However, significant movements were observed 

between the Straits of Florida and adjacent waters, and the Gulf of Mexico and the area near 

Cape Hatteras (35°N) (Ortiz et al., 2003; Obersen et al., 2008). One of the main objectives of 

this study was to determine the summer residence and migratory route of sailfish during and after 

the spawning season off southeast Brazil. Unfortunately, the low number of tags deployed and 

their premature releases have left this question still unanswered.  

However, the analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of catch rates and 

reproduction data (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 4)  have suggested a southward movement of the 

stock from October on, from the western central tropical Atlantic towards the southeast Brazilian 

coast, in order to spawn. After spawning, the sailfish is probably driven northeastward in order to 

return to the tropical western central tropical Atlantic. Despite of the fact that the tagged sailfish 

did not show this migration pattern, the rather short monitored time may have prevented that. 

Besides, it has been known that the capture of sailfish between April and September is atypical 

off southeast Brazilian coast, evidencing the species exit from this area.  

On the other hand, the results of the present work showed evidences that the 

residence time of sailfish off southeast Brazilian during the spawning season might be extended 

until at least mid March. Information of conventional tagging also demonstrated a degree of 

fidelity of sailfish in southeast Brazilian coast during the spawning season peak. One sailfish 

with a conventional tag was recaptured in the southeast Brazilian coast, close to one year after 

release and during the spawning period, very close to the tagging site (Amorim et al., 2011).  

Despite the number of days and the amount of data obtained in the present work 

were rather low, this study represents the first observations of vertical and horizontal habitat 

utilization of sailfish in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. As more tags are deployed additional 

information will be generated, helping to better describe the migratory movements of the sailfish 

stock and their relationship with important events of life cycle, such as spawning season in the 

Atlantic Ocean. In conclusion, the present results provide information into the biology of sailfish 



94 

 

in the southwestern Atlantic and how vertical distributions during the day and night are 

influenced by temperature. The diel variability of tagged individuals highlights the need for 

detailed spatiotemporal studies linking habitat preferences to fisheries data.

Chapter 6 - Catch rates of Atlantic sailfish 
caught by sport fishery in southern Brazil  
Abstract 

In the present study, a generalized linear model (GLM), assuming a negative 

binomial distribution and log as link function, was used to generate a standardized CPUE series 

for the sailfish caught by recreational fishing boats based in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro States, 

off southern Brazil, from 1996 to 2008. The response variable was the number of sailfish caught 

per number of boats registered in the tournament per day. The following factors were tested in 

the analyses: “year”, “month”, “target” and “state”, representing the main effects of the 

explanatory variables. Fishing effort is an offset term. The factor “area” was not significant and 

no interactions were included in the final model. The factor “month” explained the largest 

amount of variation, followed by “year” and “target”. The proportion of the deviance explained 

by the model was about 0.35 (pseudo-R2). The diagnostic plots revealed that the model residuals 

are homoscedastic and model seems to be not biased. Residuals are approximately normally 

distributed. Discrepancies between residual and standard normal distributions are small and 

appear only in the tails. Therefore, both negative binomial error distribution and link functions 

seemed to be acceptable. The overall pattern of the standardized catch rate indicates a relatively 

stable trend with a slight decline throughout the whole period. Despite these results conform with 

previous findings, there were some discrepancies with previous standardization of sailfish catch 

rate in the southwestern Atlantic. This could be explained by the differences in the 

standardization procedures, or even because the data sets are from different fleets.  

6.1. Introduction 

Billfish sport fishing tournaments have a long history in Brazil. Since 1956, this 

activity has been promoted mainly in the States of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, southeast 

Brazil. Nowadays, however, fishing tournaments are held along the entire Brazilian coast, 

although they are still largely concentrated off the coast of Cabo Frio, in Rio de Janeiro, in 

Ilhabela, in São Paulo, and in Vitória, in Espirito Santo. The fishing season happens mainly from 



117 

 

October to February (spring/summer), with the blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), the white 

marlin (Kajika albida) and the sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) being the main targeted species.  

Catch and effort data from sport fisheries are an important source of information 

on trends of fish stocks. Time series of catch rate have been frequently used in stock assessments 

for large pelagic fishes, as an index of relative abundance. Such application, however, has been 

widely debated (Maunder and Punt, 2004), since trends in catch rate can be influenced by many 

factors in addition to stock abundance, including the fishing season, spatial variability of the fish 

stock, target species as response to changes in fishing gear, environmental conditions and 

fishermen’s experience. Such variations may lead to significant changes in catchability, 

introducing serious errors in the estimation of abundance indices (Fréon and Misund, 1999). To 

overcome this problem, the most common approach has been to standardize the catch rate, in 

order to remove the effects of other factors unrelated to stock abundance (Maunder and Punt, 

2004). This approach has been used widely in fisheries science, having become a crucial step for 

accurate stock assessments (Gulland, 1983; Maunder and Punt, 2004).  

In the Brazilian sport fishery, a number of changes in fishing grounds and target 

species, among others, which directly affect the catch composition, have been well documented 

(Arfelli et al., 1994; Amorim and Arfelli, 2001; Amorim and Silva, 2005). Thus, the use of 

nominal catch rates derived from this fishery as an index of relative abundance can lead to 

interpretation errors, making its utilization rather complex. Hence, in the present chapter a 

nominal catch rate series of sailfish caught by the sport fishery in southern Brazil (1996-2008) is 

presented with the corresponding standardized values, for identification of the main factors of 

influence. 

6.2. Material and Methods 

6.2.1. Catch and effort data 

Radio logbook records from recreational tournaments of Yacht Clubs from São 

Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have been collected since 1996 by voluntary submission of the 

tournament organizers and by onboard observers. The data set included a total of 94 tournament 

days, from 1996 to 2008. Records for each tournament day included boat names, total number of 

operating boats per tournament day, total number of fish hooked, and their fate (i.e. lost, 



118 

 

released, tagged and released, or boarded), by species, as well as the size and weight of all 

boarded fish.  

6.2.2. Modeling 

The number of sailfish caught per number of boats recorded in the tournament per 

day (C) was considered as a relative index of abundance. The logarithm was used as a link 

function, in the following GLM model:  

 y ? log(C)  

? ~ year + month + target + State + interactions + offset(log[fishing effort]) + ?  

where the terms “year”, “month”, “target” and ”state” represent the main effects 

of the explanatory variables, while “interactions” stands for the first order interaction between all 

main effects. Fishing effort is an offset term and ? is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d) 

random variable with a negative binomial distribution. Despite the relatively low zero-count 

(~30%, Figure 6.1), the empirical distribution of C data was still too zero-inflated and over-

dispersed to fit a traditional Poisson distribution (Figure 6.2). The negative binomial distribution, 

however, seemed to accommodate the data well (Figure 6.3) and was, for this reason, chosen to 

fit the models, using statistical software R 2.12.0 (R Development Core Team, 2010).  

The factor “year” included data from 1996 to 2008, while “month” included only 

data from October to February, since there is no tournament out of this period. The factor 

“target” was based in the target fish set for each tournament, including blue marlin or sailfish. 

The factor “State” accounted for the tournaments carried out off São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro 

coasts, in two different fishing areas about 90 miles from coast, as follows: A: 23° to 24°S/41° to 

42°W, for Rio de Janeiro; and B: 24º to 25°S/44º to 45°W, for São Paulo (Figure 6.4).   

The selection of predictors or interactions and the decision on their entry or 

exclusion was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1978) and the total 

deviance explained. Chi-square tests were also computed to determine whether terms yielded 

significant (p &amp;lt;0.05) reductions in the residual deviance upon entry into the GLM.  Finally the 

residual distribution was checked in order to evaluate the goodness of fitted model. The 

estimates of standardized catch rate were based on the predictions obtained for each year, fixing

the level of remaining factors at the level with the highest number of observations. The standard 

errors of estimates were also presented. 

6.3. Results 

6.3.1. Exploratory analysis 

The fishing effort (calculated as number of tournament days monitored) ranged 

from 2, in 2006 to 11 in 2003 while the total catch including all species (marlins, tunas and other 

teleosts) reached from 20 in 2006 to 290 in 2007 (Figure 6.5). In general, the total catch, as 

expected, followed the variation of fishing effort (Figure 6.5). The sailfish was the most caught 

species during the whole period, representing 75% of the total catch, followed by blue marlin 

with 18% while tunas (Thunnus spp.) and white marlin had a small relative participation on the 

total catch (7%) (Figure 6.6). 

The catch composition of the main species caught in the tournaments also varied 

with year (Figure 6.7). The sailfish was the most caught species in almost all years, except for 

1998, when the blue marlin dominated the catches (Figure 6.7). Other species were also caught 

in much less numbers, including the white marlin and tunas (Figure 6.6 and Figure 6.7). 

 The means of sailfish nominal catch rate for each level of the factors are presented 

in Figure 6.8. The mean nominal catch rate was much larger for 2004, 2006 and 2007, with the 

lowest values being observed in the rest of the years. The monthly catch rate was much higher 

for December and January than in other months (Figure 6.8). Expectedly, the sailfish catch rate 

was usually higher when it was the main target of the tournament. The catch rate in Rio de 

Janeiro was always higher than in São Paulo (Figure 6.8). 

6.3.2. Standardization of catch rate 

Table 6.1 shows the deviance analysis of the selected model. The factor “area” 

was not significant and no interactions were included in the final model. The factor “month” 

explained the largest amount of variation, followed by “year” and “target”. The proportion of the 

deviance explained by the model is about 0.35 (pseudo-R2). Estimations of the coefficients are in 

Table 6.2. Only coefficients for the years 1998 and 2000 were positive. Most the coefficients 

estimated for the factor “Year” were not significant though most of standard errors were bigger 



120 

 

than the coefficients estimated. All estimations for “Month” were negative (except December) 

and most of them were significant. Residual partial plots for all main factors seem to be well 

distributed around zero (Figure 6.9). December and January were the most productive period for 

fishing sailfish. As expected, higher catch rates were observed when the sailfish was the target 

species of the tournament (Figure 6.9).  

The diagnostic plots revealed that the model residuals are homoscedastic and 

approximately normally distributed (Figure 6.10). Discrepancies between residual and standard 

normal distributions are small and appear only in the tails (Figure 6.10). Therefore both the 

negative binomial error distribution and the link functions seem to conform well to the data.  

The standardized catch rates and the standard error estimations (Figure 6.11) show 

that the standard errors of estimates were relatively small, with the great majority being smaller 

than the year coefficient estimations. The overall pattern of the standardized catch rate indicates 

a relatively stable trend with a slightly decline throughout the whole period (Figure 6.11). The 

nominal catch rate, in turn, showed a different trend, with an apparent increase in values after 

2002, with one pronounced peak in 2004 (Figure 6.11).  

6.4. Discussion 

Assuming that catch rates are proportional to the actual stock abundance implies 

the acceptance of several assumptions related to the variation of the catchability coefficient. 

However, there are several limitations in this approach. Such constraints are particularly complex 

in the case of non-target species, such as billfishes in the pelagic longline fishery, which is 

characterized for high percentage of zero observations combined with few large catch values due 

to school aggregation, since some Istiophorid billfishes, like sailfish, often form schools in 

specific locations (Nakamura, 1985). Catch and effort data from sport fishery tournaments, 

therefore, may be a better alternative to estimate billfish catch rates.  

Comparatively, the present data set had an amount of zero-valued observations 

much lower (30%) than the commercial longline fishing (~75%, see Chapter 4 ), although, it was 

still zero-inflated and left-skewed distribution to account with problems of overdispersion, when 

the ratio of the residual deviance and the degrees of freedom is much higher than 1 (Zuur et al., 

2009). In the previous exploratory analysis, different statistical probability distributions that are 



121 

 

able to accommodate a high percentage of zero observations (i.e. Poisson and Tweedie) were 

tested. However, the negative binomial distribution appeared to be the best option to analyze the 

sailfish catch rate, with no evidence of overdispersion and the most satisfactory residuals 

distribution. 

In general, the trend of partial residuals estimated for each covariate followed the 

signal of nominal catch rate mean values. For the season effect (i.e. month), December and 

January were the most productive fishing period. In fact, sailfish catch rates are highly seasonal, 

since it is very likely that mature sailfish migrate from the western central tropical Atlantic 

towards the southeast Brazilian coast to spawn and remain in the area from about February to 

March. After spawning, sailfish probably depart in a north-east direction to return to the tropical 

western central tropical Atlantic (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 4). Regarding the target species 

effect, when the sailfish is the target, the yacht speed is less than when the boats are targeting 

blue marlins. The bait type also changes, depending on the species targeted, with a preference for 

dead, natural bait when the sailfish is targeted and artificial baits when the target species is the 

blue marlin.  

The final estimations of year effect showed that most of the estimated standard 

errors are not larger than the coefficient estimations; hence we assumed the results are useful to 

evaluate the sailfish recreational fisheries status off the Brazilian coast. If the standardized catch 

rates are assumed to reflect well the local relative abundance of the stock, the results suggest that 

the biomass of sailfish caught in southwestern Atlantic have suffered a very slight decline along 

the studied years. Amorim et al. (2006) also reported catch rate indices calculated for sailfish 

caught by tournaments of recreational fishery carried out in São Paulo State and found a similar 

trend of standardized CPUE, which seemed to oscillate around a rather stable level, from 1996 to 

2004. Wor et al. (2010) analyzed catch and effort data from Brazilian longline fleet and 

demonstrated a similar trend with a moderate decline between 1978 and 2008. Ortiz and Arocha 

(2004), in turn, reported a stable trend for sailfish caught by Venezuelan longline fleet in the 

Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.

Chapter 7 - General conclusions and 
recommendations  

In the Atlantic Ocean, sailfish has been managed by ICCAT, which has 

traditionally assumed the existence of two stocks (west and east) separated arbitrarily by the 

meridians associated with the mid Atlantic Ridge (long. 40°W, North Atlantic; long. 20°W, 

South Atlantic). The results of the last sailfish stock assessment carried out by ICCAT in 2009 

indicated that both stocks are probably overfished, particularly the one from the eastern Atlantic. 

However, the analyses in this assessment were severely hampered by an acute lack of accurate 

data (i.e. catch and effort data, ICCAT 2009). Moreover, the difference of recent trends in 

abundance among the different fleets, particularly after 1990, also suggested a high degree of 

uncertainty regarding the status of sailfish stocks in Atlantic (ICCAT 2009). Hence, despite of 

ICCAT work group have recommended that the catches of western stock should not exceed the 

current levels, no specific management or regulations were adopted.  

The absence of basic life history information (i.e. reproductive biology and 

growth parameters) has precluded the application of size or age-structured models in the past 

sailfish stock assessments in the Atlantic Ocean. The length at first sexual maturity estimated in 

the present work, however, can be converted to age at first sexual maturity, being thus directly 

applicable to the next stock assessment. Additionally, this study also estimated various other 

important parameters, such as fecundity, as well as sex ratios stratified by area and season, which 

might be useful to arrange sailfish catch statistics by sex. Furthermore, stratifying catches by 

latitude during spawning and non-spawning periods could be useful to reduce the variances of 

abundance indices used in stock assessments. Future research, therefore, should include 

simulation studies to explore the quantitative effects of sex stratification by season and area on 

stock assessments.  

Another aspect presented in this study was the spatial modeling of size at catch. 

Size-based indicators are progressively being used in fisheries management and could be a useful 

instrument for monitoring sailfish stocks during periods when stock assessments are not 

conducted. Monitoring the mean length and catch rates of sailfish in the pelagic longline 

fisheries during the spawning season in the Southeast Brazilian coast, for example, may provide 



135 

 

some insight into the spawning stock biomass. Although there was no indication of a declining 

mean size of spawning sailfish in the studied area over the duration of the present investigation, 

longer-term trends were not investigated.  

The present results also show that the inclusion of oceanographic variables in 

catch rate standardization might provide a better understanding of the possible relationship 

between the fishing gear behavior and catchability, as a result of the physiological ecology of 

sailfish. Regarding the Brazilian catch rate series, despite the present results agree relatively well 

with previous findings, there were some discrepancies between the available times series of 

sailfish catch rate in southwestern Atlantic. This could be explained primarily by the different 

data sets used, but also by the diverse standardization procedures.  

New analysis, incorporating new variables, and the development of cooperative 

studies could be useful to identify the causes of the differences between authors found so far. 

Although the present results are speculative, considering the rather limited amount of data used, 

they provide an additional catch rate series to be taken into account when assessing the condition 

of the sailfish stock in the South Atlantic. Moreover, the hotspots identified in the present 

analysis might serve as a basis for the delimitation of the explanatory variable “area” in the next 

catch rate standardization procedures, considering also a possible interaction between area and 

month, since there is a strong correlation of these hotspots with summer months in the southeast 

Brazilian coast. 

The understanding of the population structure of exploited species is one of the 

main requirements for the proper delineation of fishery management units and consequently to 

an effective management and conservation of fisheries resources. In the last sailfish stock 

assessment the billfish working group concluded that there was a need to reevaluate the stock 

structure for the species (ICCAT, 2009), in light of new biological information. Some questions 

stemming from that are: 

(1) Are South Atlantic sailfish a separate stock from North Atlantic sailfish?  

(2) Are Southwest Atlantic sailfish a separate stock from Southeast Atlantic 

sailfish and North Atlantic sailfish?  

(3) Do South Atlantic sailfish constitute a single stock unit? 



136 

 

According to Gulland (1983), several classes of information should be considered 

in the delineation of stocks: (i) spatiotemporal discontinuities in fish abundance, as reflected in 

catch rate by fishing vessels; (ii) location and timing of spawning; (iii) differences in population 

parameters, such as, growth and size structure; (v) tagging data; (iv) genetic differences. The 

provision of new information on South Atlantic sailfish with regard to several of these categories 

was the primary task of the present dissertation, as discussed in the previous chapters. 

Spawning areas for sailfish have been identified on the basis of gonad 

examination and larval distribution in the Northwest in the Straits of Florida (Voss, 1953; Jolley, 

1974; Richardson et. al., 2009a and b) and Southeast coast of Brazil (Amorim and Arfelli, 1981; 

Mourato et. al., 2009). On these grounds, it has been generally accepted that sailfish spawn in 

summer in sub-tropical Atlantic waters centred on 20°N and 20°S. These spawning grounds are 

thus symmetrically distributed in the two hemispheres, with temporal separation of spawning 

seasons. On the other hand, spawning in the eastern Atlantic has been observed all year long with 

a peak in April on the West African shelf (Ovchinnikov, 1971). Ueyanagi et al. (1970) reported 

taking sailfish larvae off Angola and Sierra Leone between November to April. More recent 

preliminary information also suggests peak spawning of sailfish in the area of the Gulf of Guinea 

from October to December (ICCAT, 2009).  

 The geographical separation between Northern and Southern Hemisphere 

spawning grounds seems to be reasonably supported also by tagging data which have not shown 

any trans-equatorial movements. This information strongly suggests that South Atlantic sailfish 

and North Atlantic sailfish pertain to different populations. A possible separation of South 

Atlantic sailfish into two independent stocks, however, is not so clear. The main question 

remaining to be answered, thus, with regard to the Atlantic sailfish stock structure is: what is the 

level of connectivity between the southwestern and the eastern Atlantic sailfish? 

The present results showed that, at least in part, the sailfish stock in the Atlantic 

Ocean is structured longitudinally according to ontogenetic stages, reflected by environmental 

preferences of adults and juveniles or sub-adults. This fact combined with the existence of 

discrete non-overlapping of spawning seasons and southwestern and eastern Atlantic and a clear 

continuity of sailfish catch throughout the entire equatorial Atlantic basin, together with rather 

narrow distance between the coast of Africa and the northeast tip of Brazil suggest that such a 



137 

 

longitudinal mixing is highly likely. The analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of catch rates 

and reproduction data have suggested a southward movement of the stock from October on, from 

the western central tropical Atlantic towards the southeast Brazilian coast, in order to spawn. 

After spawning, the sailfish is probably driven northeastward in order to return to the tropical 

western central tropical Atlantic.  

Thus, it is likely that some interchange does happen in the equatorial region 

between southwestern sailfish and eastern sailfish, particularly during the second and third 

quarters of each year. Moreover, the difference of the mean sailfish size between the 

southwestern and eastern Atlantic also might be an indication that sailfish after achieving the 

sexual maturity spawn for the first time in the western side, spawning in the eastern side from 

that time onward. Although the separation of the northwest sailfish stock seems to be clear, there 

is still a large uncertainty about the degree of mixing between southwestern and eastern sailfish. 

Should it be considered a single stock for management purposes and what would be the impact 

of different stock structure scenarios in the results of the assessments are some of the questions 

that still need to be answered. Based on the information then available, during the last 

assessment, ICCAT used the two stocks hypothesis (east and west) for Atlantic sailfish. In light 

of the information hereby presented, other alternative stock structure scenarios should also be 

considered in the next sailfish assessments to be carried out by ICCAT, although additional 

studies, such as tagging studies, confirmation of timing and area of spawning in the eastern side 

of the Atlantic and genetic analysis are still needed to reduce the uncertainty in regard of sailfish 

stock structure in the Atlantic Ocean.  

Bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries represents the major source of fishing 

mortality for sailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean. In this context, the development of 

management tools based on spatial analyses of the pelagic longline fisheries, such as time-area 

closures might be a good option to decrease or to ensure appropriate levels of catches. Goodyear 

(1999), for example, demonstrated that time-area restrictions might significantly reduce the 

bycatch of billfishes in US pelagic longline fisheries with minor impacts on catch of target 

species. Evidently that the hotspots identified in the present work could be used to form the basis 

for a time-area closure as a management tool for the sailfish population in the southwestern 

Atlantic Ocean. The overlap between peak commercial longline catches of sailfish off Southeast 



138 

 

Brazil and peak spawning activity encourages careful consideration of management measures 

required to ensure that spawning stock biomass is fished at a sustainable level.  

On the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that hot-spot areas are consistent over 

years (e.g. Watson et al 2008; Bigelow and Mourato, 2010) and thus additional research using 

catch and effort data from different fleets (i.e. ICCAT data base) covering a broader area are still 

needed to refine the highest density areas in Atlantic Ocean prior to definition of time-area 

closures (e.g. Goodyear, 2003). Furthermore, the effectiveness of bycatch reduction measures 

involving time-area controls must also take in account the degree of overlap between the bycatch 

and target species and a possible reallocation of fishing effort, including socioeconomic aspects 

about the nature and dynamics of the pelagic longline fishery (Goodyear 1999, 2003; Bigelow 

and Mourato, 2010).   

Additionally, other possible management measures that might also result in an 

effective reduction of fishing mortality of sailfish involve changes of fishing gear, such as the 

employment of circle hooks (e.g. Kerstetter and Graves, 2008), which has proven to increase 

survival of the fish caught, followed by the mandatory release of specimens that are still alive at 

haul-back. Another alternative to significantly reduce fishing mortality is to increase the hook 

fishing depths, since the present results showed a marked preference of the tagged sailfish for the 

upper 10m of the water column during any time of the day. Bigelow and Mourato (2010), for 

instance, demonstrated that the redistribution of hook depth in Hawaii-based longline fleet 

significantly reduced the striped marlin catches with minor impacts on the catches of the target 

species, such as bigeye tuna.  

Finally, the results obtained by the present study have presented new information 

that might be used to establish new management measures aiming at ensuring the conservation of 

sailfish stocks in the Atlantic Ocean.
