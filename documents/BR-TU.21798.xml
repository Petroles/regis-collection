As distribuições de Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe e Al foram investigadas em sedimentos 
superficiais coletados em 19 sítios da Bacia Hidrográfica do Rio Sergipe, Nordeste do Brasil. Foi 
definida uma base geoquímica para a região (RGB) usando o ferro como elemento de referência. 
Fatores de enriquecimento (EF) e índice de geoacumulação (Igeo) foram empregados para determinar 
a contribuição por origem antropogênica. Valores de EF mostraram que os sedimentos dos sítios 
1, 5 e 13 podem ser considerados contaminados por Pb, Cr e Cu, respectivamente. Valores de Igeo 
mostraram que o sítio 13 pode ser considerado contaminado. Há uma grande predominância nos 
sedimentos de metais de origem natural. A possível toxicidade foi avaliada comparando com os 
valores PEC-TEC dos guias de qualidade de sedimentos (SQG). Análise de componentes principais 
(PCA) separou claramente os pontos em dois grupos e a análise de agrupamento hierárquico (HCA) 
confirmou as interpretações feitas pela PCA.

The distributions of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe and Al were investigated in surface sediments 
collected at 19 sites in the Sergipe River Hydrographic Basin of Northeast Brazil. A regional 
geochemical baseline (RGB) was defined using iron as a reference element. Enrichment factors 
(EF) and geoaccumulation indices (Igeo) were used to determine the extent of anthropogenic 
metal pollution. EF values showed that sediments from sites 1, 5 and 13 could be considered 
contaminated by Pb, Cr and Cu, respectively. Igeo values showed that only site 13 could be considered 
contaminated. For other sites, results indicated that naturally occurring metals predominated in the 
sediments. Possible toxicity related to these metals was examined using the comparing sediment 
chemical data with sediment quality guidelines (SQG) PEC-TEC values. Principal component 
analysis (PCA) clearly separated the sites into two groups and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) 
confirmed the interpretations made from the PCA results.

Introduction

Metal pollutants have received considerable attention 
due to their persistence, biogeochemical recycling, and 
environmental risk.1 Sediments act as a reservoir for metals 
introduced into the aquatic environment as a result of natural 
geochemical processes (such as weathering and erosion 
of geological formations) and anthropogenic activities 
(such as urbanization, industrialization, deforestation, 
land erosion and agricultural practices).2,3 Metals can be 
remobilized and released from sediment into the overlying 
water column during chemical and biological processes.4,5

High metal concentrations in sediment do not 
automatically imply that contamination has occurred, but 
may simply reflect the natural mineralogical composition 
of the parent geological material, and the grain size and 
organic matter content of the host sediment.4,5 Many 
studies of metal accumulation in the aquatic environment 
have focused on the establishment of geochemical 
baselines for evaluation of the magnitudes of natural and/
or anthropogenic metal inputs.2 Knowledge of background 
metal concentrations, and the natural variability, is therefore 
necessary before assessments of anthropogenic impacts 
can be made.6 Various normalization procedures have been 
employed to take account of natural variability, and to detect 
and quantify anthropogenic enrichment.7,8

Two procedures can be used to normalize metal 
c o n c e n t r a t i o n s :  g r a n u l o m e t r i c  a n d  g e o c h e m i c a l 
normalizations.4 Granulometric normalization involves the 
isolation of a defined grain size fraction by sieving, with the 
aim of reducing the dilution effects of non-metal-bearing 
minerals in coarse grained sediment.9,10 Geochemical 
normalization is based on a procedure that involves 
mathematical correlations between metal concentrations 
and the concentrations of a reference element, such as 
Al, Fe, Li, or Sc. These reference elements are tracers for 
natural metal-binding phases, and are ideally not influenced 
by anthropogenic inputs.6,11-13 Chemical normalization has 
the following advantages: (i) a single analytical procedure 
can be used to determine all necessary elements, including 
the pollutants and those used for normalization; (ii) minimal 
manipulation of the sample minimizes contamination; 
(iii) use of the chosen element (or elements) can normalize 
both grain size and compositional variability.14

It is accepted that determination of the total concentrations 
of metals in sediments is not sufficient to predict the capacity 
for mobilization of these elements.15-17 The environmental 
behavior of trace metals is critically dependent on their 
chemical form, which influences mobility, bioavailability and 
toxicity to organisms. Consequently, there is considerable 
interest in understanding the associations of these elements 
with the solid phase.18,19

The sediment quality guidelines (SQG) system, 
developed by North American agencies has been adopted 
as an informal tool to evaluate sediment chemical data in 
relation to possible adverse effects on aquatic biota.8 The 
consensus-based sediment quality guidelines for fresh 
waters have been established for 28 chemicals (metals, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated 
biphenyls and pesticides) and for each contaminant provide 
two concentrations associated with adverse effects in 
aquatic organisms.20 The threshold effect concentration 
(TEC) is that below which no adverse effects should occur, 
and the probable effect concentration (PEC) is that above 
which adverse effects may occur frequently.8,20

There has been no systematic evaluation of the metals 
present in the sediments of the Sergipe River Hydrographic 
Basin in Northeast Brazil, although a limited number of 
previous studies have investigated the water and sediment 
quality of individual rivers and estuarine regions of the 
basin.3,8,15,16,21 The present work therefore describes a 
geochemical evaluation of trace metals in surface sediments 
of this river basin. Sediment samples were analyzed by 
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 
(ICP OES), in order to define a regional geochemical 
baseline, to identify impacted areas and assess the extent 
of sediment contamination, and to distinguish natural and 

anthropogenic inputs. Calculations were made of metal 
enrichment factors (EF) and geoaccumulation indices (Igeo). 
Possible toxicity was evaluated for each metal, based on 
consensus-based SQG reference data. Potential factors 
controlling the distribution and mobility of metals in the 
sediments were also investigated. Statistical analyses 
(using PCA and HCA) were conducted in order to identify 
common origins and/or behaviors of the contaminants.

Experimental

Study area

The Sergipe River Hydrographic Basin is located 
in the State of Sergipe (population 1.01 million), in 
the Northeast of Brazil, between latitudes 10°21’S and 
10°55’S, and longitudes 37°11’W and 37°41’W. It has 
an area of 3673 km2 and drains approximately 16.7% of 
the State. The climate can be characterized as tropical, 
with an annual mean temperature of 25 °C and an average 
annual rainfall of 1333 mm.22 The main tributaries in the 
basin are the Rivers Sovacão, Lages, Campanha, Jacoca, 
Vermelho, Jacarecica, Pitanga, Poxim, Salgado, Cágado, 
Ganhamoroba, Parnamirim and Pomonga.22

Since the 1990s, there has been rapid expansion of 
aquaculture, industry, and agriculture in the region, with 
simultaneous development in the areas of civil construction, 
transportation, and tourism. These dramatic changes have 
adversely affected water quality in the basin.21 The main 
sources of trace metal contamination are municipal and 
industrial wastewaters, agricultural runoff, and emissions 
from metallurgical industries.15,23

Sample collection and pretreatment

Sediment samples were collected in December 2010, 
at nineteen locations including industrial, residential, 
commercial and rural sites, in the Sergipe River Hydrographic 
Basin (Figure S1, in Supplementary Information), using a 
core sampler composed of cellulose acetate butyrate. The 
undisturbed upper 5 cm of the sediment was sampled, and 
then placed in acid-rinsed polypropylene vessels using a 
plastic spatula. Three samples were taken at each location. 
The sediments were oven-dried (50 °C, 12 h), homogenized 
in a porcelain mortar, sieved (&amp;lt;2 mm), and stored in plastic 
containers until the analyses were performed.3

Reagents

All reagents were analytical grade or better. Ultrapure 
water (18 M? cm) was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q 



Silva et al. 1671Vol. 23, No. 9, 2012

system. All glass and plastic utensils were washed with 10% 
(v/v) nitric acid for 48 h, and rinsed with ultrapure water 
prior to use. Stock metal standard solutions (1000 mg L?1) 
were prepared from standard vials (Tritisol, Merck) 
containing 1.000 ± 0.002 g of metal in 2% (v/v) nitric 
acid. Calibration standards of each metal were obtained 
by suitable dilutions of the stock solutions. Three certified 
reference materials, LKSD-1 CCNRP (Canada lake 
sediment), NCS DC 75304 (China river sediment) and 
NCS DC 78301 (China marine sediment) were analyzed 
for quality control purposes.

Total metals extraction procedure

The metals were extracted by digesting portions (ca. 
0.5 g) of the samples in closed Teflon vessels with 2 mL 
of HNO3, 1 mL of HCl and 4 mL of HF, at 140 

oC for 2 h. 
After cooling, the vessels were opened and heated at 210 oC 
to complete dryness. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL 
of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, and the final volume was made up to 
50 mL.16 The solutions were stored in polyethylene flasks 
for later determination of metals using ICP OES.

Calculation of the limit of detection (LOD) for each 
metal was based on the expression 3s/b, where s is the 
standard deviation of the blank, and b is the slope of the 
calibration plot.24 Ten extraction procedure blanks were 
analyzed, and LOD values took into account the use of 
1 g portions of sample in extractions, together with any 
necessary dilutions. Correlation coefficients (r) of the 
calibration curves were better than 0.998, for all elements 
studied. The results showed that there was no significant 
analytical contamination, and that LOD values varied 
from 0.04 (Cr and Mn) to 0.32 ?g g?1 (Al). These limits 
of detection are acceptable for general environmental 
analyses, and are comparable to those obtained in previous 
work using similar materials.16,25-27

The efficiency of the extraction method was determined 
by analysis of four replicates of certified reference material 
(CRM), for river sediment (NCS DC 75304/China) and 
marine sediment (NCS DC 78301/China). The results 
showed that recoveries of the metals from the CRMs were in 
the range 81-103%. These values indicate that the efficiency 
of the method was satisfactory, given the complex nature 
of the sediment matrix. Similar values have been reported 
in the literature.8,21,25,28

Partial metals extraction procedure

Partial metal concentrations were determined using 
US EPA Method 200.8. Samples (ca. 1 g) were treated in 
closed Teflon vessels using 4 mL of (1+1) HNO3 solution 

and 10 mL of (1+5) HCl solution. The mixtures were heated 
at 95 oC for 30 min. Following extraction, the samples 
were filtered using quantitative filter paper, transferred 
to 50 mL volumetric flasks, and the volumes were made 
up using ultra-pure water.16 The solutions were stored in 
polyethylene flasks for later determination of metals using 
ICP OES.

Ten blank solutions were prepared in the same way as 
samples during the digestion procedure, and for quality 
control purposes a lake sediment reference material 
(LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada) was analyzed alongside the 
samples. LOD values (in ?g g?1) varied from 0.001 (Cd) 
to 0.080 (Pb). Recoveries of the trace metals were in the 
range 97-103%.

Organic carbon determination

The carbon contents of the samples were determined 
using an elemental analyzer with a combustion temperature 
of 900 oC. The organic carbon (Corg) content was calculated 
by the difference in the amount of carbon determined before 
and after calcination of the samples at 550 oC for 1 h.3 For 
analytical quality control, each set of sample analyses was 
accompanied by three replicate analyses of lake sediment 
reference material (LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada), for which 
the mean recovery was 98.4 ± 0.7%.

Instrumentation

Sediment extractions were performed using PTFE 
vessels and a digester block (Techal TE007A). The carbon 
contents of the samples were measured using an NCHS-O 
elemental analyzer (Flash ES 1112).

An inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometer (ICP OES) with an axial view configuration 
(VISTA PRO, Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) was used 
for the determination of aluminium, cobalt, chromium, 
copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc. The ICP 
OES system was equipped with a solid-state CCD that 
enabled simultaneous measurements to be made in the 
range 167-785 nm. The instrumental parameters were as 
follows: 40 MHz radio frequency; 1100 W applied power; 
15.0 L min?1 plasma gas flow rate; 1.5 L min?1 auxiliary gas 
flow rate; 0.8 mL min?1 nebulizer gas flow rate; 0.8 mL min?1 
sample uptake rate; 1 s signal integration time. The sample 
introduction system comprised a concentric SeaSpray 
nebulizer and a cyclonic spray chamber. The analysis 
was carried out at the following wavelengths (nm): Al I 
(396.152); Co II (230.353); Cr II (206.158); Cu I (327.395); 
Fe II (259.940); Mn II (259.372); Ni II (221.648); Pb II 
(220.353); Zn II (202.548), where “I” indicates the atomic

emission line, and “II” indicates the ionic emission line. 
In most cases, the wavelengths were selected according 
to the most prominent line; secondary lines were used as 
an alternative to avoid possible interferences. All analyses 
were performed in triplicate.

Statistical analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical 
cluster analysis (HCA) and correlation coefficient 
calculations were performed using the program Statistica 
for Windows v. 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA). One-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparison test 
were employed (using Origin v. 7.0) to test for significant 
differences (p ? 0.05) in metal concentrations among the 
sites.

Results and Discussion

Metal and organic carbon distributions

The metal and organic carbon contents of the samples 
are presented in Table 1. The ranges of concentrations 
found were (in ?g g-1) 2.5-35.9 (Co); 4.6-91.9 (Cr); 
2.3-53.7 (Cu); 2.4-37.5 (Ni); 1.9-28.2 (Pb); 2.6-65.6 (Zn) 

and (in %) 0.1-4.9 (Fe); 2.7-6.9 (Al). The highest values 
of all elements were obtained for sites 1-3. This could be 
due to either natural variability between the sediments, 
or to anthropogenic contamination.5,29,30 Organic carbon 
(Corg) contents varied between 0.2 and 2.9%, with highest 
values for sites 7, 10 and 19, indicating an anthropogenic 
contribution.22 The main sources of organic matter are 
municipal and industrial wastewaters, and agricultural 
runoff.15

Correlation analysis was used to identify potential 
factors controlling the distribution and mobility of metals 
in the sediments. The Spearman correlation matrix obtained 
is provided in Table 2. The linear regression analysis 
can provide information about the similarity of natural 
and anthropogenic sources, as well as the environmental 
behavior of metals. Significance was indicated by values 
of the correlation coefficient greater than 0.60 (using a 
confidence level of 95%).

Strong correlations were observed between most of the 
trace metals and iron (r &gt; 0.7) and manganese (r &gt; 0.6), with 
the exception of Cu (r = 0.5). However, weak correlations 
were observed with aluminum (r &amp;lt;0.4) (Table 2). The 
strong correlations between manganese and iron, and 
between iron and the other metals, showed that iron and 
manganese were the main inorganic carriers that controlled

the distribution of metals in these sediments. According to 
Sabadini-Santos et al.,2 the rivers of Northeast Brazil are the 
main source of smectite and illite particles coated with iron 
oxyhydroxides found in the estuarine and near-shore coastal 
sediments of the region. A possible explanation for the 
relatively low correlation between Al and the other metals 
is natural variability of metal concentrations between 
sediments of the Sergipe River Basin. Iron has also been 
successfully used as a normalizer in other studies.2,5,6,9,31

The trace metals showed no correlation with Corg 
(r &amp;lt;0.10), indicative of no, or weak, association between 
these elements and organic matter in the sediments. This is 
in agreement with the finding that, in non-marine sediments, 
Corg is a weaker carrier than clays and metal oxides.

8,32

There were significant correlations (0.62 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.95) 
between the different trace metals (Table 2), indicative 
of a natural origin and/or similar contamination sources 
of the metals. The correlation coefficients revealed that 
Fe was the most suitable conservative element for metal 
normalization purposes.

Geochemical normalization

In order to determine the extent of contamination of 
the sediments, trace metal concentrations were normalized 
relative to iron. Various reference elements have previously 
been used for this purpose, notably iron,2,5,32 aluminium,8,33,34 
lithium8,13,29 and scandium.1,35,36

Geochemical normalization uses data obtained for 
uncontaminated sediments of a given region to calculate 
the linear regression between concentrations of the metal 
of interest and those of the reference element, and then 
tests the metal/reference ratios obtained for other (possibly 
contaminated) sites.13 The relationships between trace 
metals and reference elements can be used to indicate 
the range of naturally occurring concentrations of trace 

metals.5,29,37 The regressions between the metals and the 
normalizer (reference element) are performed following 
removal of outlier values, and delineation of a 95% 
prediction interval. The data points obtained for a possibly 
contaminated area are then projected onto the resulting 
graph. All points lying within the 95% prediction intervals 
correspond to samples that can be characterized as natural 
sediments, while points located above this region may 
indicate sediment contamination.9,11,13

The linear regression results, with values of r2 and p, 
as well as the 95% prediction intervals, are illustrated in 
Figure 1. The upper 95% prediction interval was used as 
the cutoff to identify metal enrichment in the sediments.

Mn and Zn (Figures 1f and 1g) showed similar 
distribution patterns, with all sites lying within the 95% 
prediction limits. The concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Ni 
and Pb showed enrichment at one or more sampling sites 
(Figures 1a-e), indicating possible contamination. Ni 
and Pb (Figures 1d and 1e) showed concentrations much 
higher than the 95% prediction limits at site 1, indicating 
strong enrichment of the metals in the sediment. Cobalt 
showed enrichment at sites 2 and 6 (Figure 1a), and there 
was possible anthropogenic influence for Cr (Figure 1b) 
at site 5. These sites were located in regions where there 
is intense agricultural activity.22 Copper was enriched 
at site 13 (Figure 1c), located in the densely populated 
region.22 Hence, metal concentrations in the sediments 
analyzed could be considered to be due to natural origins, 
except at sites 1, 2, 5, 6 and 13, and the regression lines 
obtained could be used to define the regional geochemical 
baseline (RGB).

The data using in the geochemical normalization 
were obtained by extraction using HF, HNO3 and HCl 
to determine the total concentrations of metals. The 
total sediment concentration of a metal does not provide 
information concerning its mobility, availability or toxicity.

Toxicity is dependent on the amount of metal available 
for bioaccumulation (accumulation by organisms), and 
it depends on those sediment properties that affect its 
bioavailability. Hence, it is possible for sediment to be 
metal-contaminated (to have a metal content higher than 
the natural background), but not manifest any toxic effects, 
depending on the geochemical processes that control the 
availability of the metal in the sediment.

Enrichment factors (EF)

For better estimation of anthropogenic inputs, 
enrichment factors (EF) were calculated for each metal, as 
described by Aloupi and Angelidis,13 using the expression  
( [ m e t a l ] / [ F e ] ) s a m p l e/ ( [ m e t a l ] / [ F e ] ) b a c k g r o u n d,  w h e r e  
([metal]/[Fe])sample is the metal to Fe ratio in a sample, and 
([metal]/[Fe])background is the natural background value of 
the metal to Fe ratio. For any given Fe concentration, the 
metal concentration on the linear regression line was used 
as the background value, and the concentration lying on the 
upper 95% prediction limit was used as a comparison value 
(CV). Due to natural mineralogical differences between the 
sediments and analytical uncertainty, only sediments with 
an EF greater than 2.0 were considered to be enriched.38

Compared to other methods based on the use of global 
backgrounds, such as average shale values39 or average 
crustal values,40 an advantage of the RGB technique is that 
it takes into account the natural geochemical variability 
related to different settings and sediment characteristics.4 
According to Mil-Homens et al.,41 the use of global 
background data can result in erroneous interpretation of 
EF values, and underestimation of metal enrichment.

Table 3 shows calculated sediment enrichment factors 
for Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb, together with comparison 
values. The EF values indicate that the most contaminated 
sediments were those from sites 1, 5 and 13, where there 
was substantial anthropogenic activity. Relatively strong 
enrichment of Cu (EF &gt; 3) was found for site 13, located 
in an area of intensive ship traffic. According to Idris,17 
enrichment by Cu is often related to ship maintenance 

and the corrosion of metallic materials. The anti-fouling 
paint used on the hulls of ships is one of the major sources 
of pollution by Cu in the aquatic environment.42,43 There 
was an enrichment of Cr at site 5 (EF &amp;lt;3), which could 
be due to industrial activities. Silva et al.44 found a high 
concentration of Cr associated with effluents from sugar, 
leather, and paper factories in the Mogi Guaçu River Basin 
of Southeast Brazil. Moderate Pb enrichment was only 
observed for site 1 (EF = 2.08), which could be due to 
inputs of agricultural effluents. Gimenon-Garcia et al.45 
found that Pb was present as an impurity in fertilizers and 
pesticides applied to agricultural soils.

Geoaccumulation index (Igeo)

The geoaccumulation index (Igeo), first described by 
Müller,46 was used here as a second criterion to identify 
contaminated sediments (Table 4). Igeo is defined by the 
expression: log2 [Cn/1.5Bn], where Cn is the measured 
concentration and Bn is the geochemical background 
concentration of the metal “n”. The factor 1.5 is a constant 
that helps take account of lithological variability. The 
metal concentration on the regression line was used as the 
background value, as reported in previous studies.1,8,47 Igeo 
can then be used as a reference to estimate the extent of 
metal pollution, in a similar way as the enrichment factor.48

The index is based on a qualitative pollution intensity 
scale, whereby sediments can be classified as unpolluted

to extremely polluted (4 &amp;lt;Igeo ? 5), and extremely polluted 
(Igeo &gt; 5).

46

The sediments from sites 1, 2, 5, and 6 were classified 
as unpolluted with respect to the trace metals Co, Cr, 
Cu, Ni, and Pb (Table 4). Sediment from site 13 (near 
shipping activities) was in the unpolluted to moderately 
polluted category, with respect to Co, Cr, Ni and Pb, and 
in the moderately polluted category, with respect to Cu. 
The results obtained using both procedures (EF and Igeo) 
therefore showed that only site 13 could be considered to 
be contaminated with Cu.

Sediment toxicity: TEC-PEC predictions

The TEC and PEC concentrations presented in the 
consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (SQG), 
developed by MacDonald et al.,20 have been adopted as 
an informal tool to evaluate sediment chemical data in 
relation to possible adverse effects on aquatic biota. TEC 
and PEC values indicate concentrations at which toxicity 
could start to be observed, and above which adverse effects 
might occur, respectively.8,20 The SQG criteria were derived 
and validated using data only for fresh water and marine 
ecosystems of the USA, but despite this limitation have 
been used to interpret data for sediments from various 
global regions.3,8,20,49-51

In order to allow assessment of toxicity based on SQG 
criteria, partial trace metal concentrations were determined 
following extraction using nitric and hydrochloric acids, 
which is a procedure compatible with that used in the 
development of the SQG. Table 5 shows the partial 
concentrations obtained for each metal, together with the 
respective PEC and TEC values.

The ranges of metal concentrations found for sites 1, 
2, 5, 6 and 13 were (?g g-1): 11.3-47.7 (Cr); 4.57-26.3 

(Cu); 4.46-30.6 (Ni); 2.36-19.5 (Pb) and 5.71-42.4 (Zn). 
For all the sites studied, the values were below the TEC, 
with respect to the trace metals Cu, Pb, and Zn, indicating 
that adverse effects on aquatic biota should be unlikely to 
occur. Cr and Ni showed concentrations superior to the 
TEC (43.34 and 22.7 mg g-1) at site 1 (47.7 and 30.6 mg g-1),  
the ability of TEC to predict adverse effects is lower for Cr 
and Ni than for the other metals.20 The predictive ability of 
the TEC achieved 72% for Cr and Ni, and 82% for Cu, Pb 
and Zn. This signifies that the probability of the incidence 
of adverse biological effects at concentrations below the 
TEC is 28% for Cr and Ni, and 18% for Cu, Pb and Zn.20

It must be emphasized that SQG criteria should be 
used with caution, as there cannot be any guarantee of a 
complete absence of toxicity at concentrations lower than 
the TEC, or that samples where the PEC is exceeded must 
necessarily be toxic, particularly considering that the SQG 
were not specifically developed for tropical conditions. For 
greater confidence, it is important that the results obtained 
here should be validated using toxicity tests.

Principal component analysis (PCA)

PCA enables data reduction and description of a given 
multidimensional system by means of a smaller number of 
new variables. It has been widely applied to identify the 
sources of metals found in sediments, and to distinguish 
natural and anthropogenic inputs.3,8,15,16 A data matrix was 
constructed using the concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, 
Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe, Al and Corg as columns and the nineteen 
sampling sites as rows (Table 1). PCA was performed on 
auto-scaled data. The loadings of the original variables 
in the first two principal components, and the variances 
explained by each component, are given in Table 6.

The first two principal components were chosen 
for modeling the data because they described 77.75% 
of the total variance. The remaining variance probably 
represented noise, since further principal components did

not show any significant variable loadings. The first two 
principal components showed important loadings for all ten 
variables, which were therefore all included in the model. 
The concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Fe 
were the dominant variables in the first principal component 
(PC1), which explained 64.76% of the total variance. Al 
and Corg showed significant negative loadings in the second 
principal component (PC2), which explained 12.99% of 
the total variance.

It can be seen from the two-dimensional scores plot 
of PC1 against PC2 (Figure 2) that PCA clearly separated 
the sampling sites into two groups along the PC1 axis. 
Group I consisted of sites 1-3, 6, 9 and 10, while group II 
comprised sites 4, 5, 7, and 11-19. Sediments from the 
sites in group I (on the left side of the graph) contained the 
highest concentrations of the trace metals Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, 
Pb, and Zn, as well as iron. Sites 9 and 10 had estuarine 

characteristics, while sites 1-3 and 6 were located in the 
agriculture region.22 The sites of group II are located to 
the right along the PC1 axis. The lowest concentrations 
of metals were measured for sediments from sites 17-19, 
which were located in the upper regions of the hydrographic 
basin where there was little evidence of domestic and/or 
industrial activities. Other group II sites were located in 
regions were close to urban areas.22

The high negative loadings of Al and Corg suggest the 
existence of a relationship between these species that could 
have influenced the dispersion of the sites along the PC2 
axis. The concentrations of Al and Corg at the different sites 
increased from top to bottom in the graph, with evidence 
for particularly high concentrations of aluminosilicates 
and organic matter at sites 10 and 19. However, correlation 
between Al and Corg was not observed for other sites.

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)

HCA, the most common cluster analysis technique used 
in environmental analysis, identifies groups of samples 
according to their similarities. HCA is a powerful tool for 
analyzing data sets to detect both expected and unexpected 
clusters, including the presence of outliers. This method can 
be used to group sediments according to their geochemical 
composition.17-19 The sediment samples from the nineteen 
sites were hierarchically clustered on the basis of their 
normalized metal concentrations. The clusters were 
generated using Ward’s method with Euclidean distances. 
The dendrogram obtained contained two distinct clusters 
(Figure 3). The first cluster, consisting of sites 1-3, 6, 9 
and 10, showed approximately 85% dissimilarity with 
the second cluster. These results were in agreement with 
those obtained using PCA, and suggest that these six sites

possessed similar geochemical characteristics, despite 
being distributed across different regions of the river basin.

Conclusions

The geochemistry of the metals Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, 
and Zn was investigated in surface sediments of the Sergipe 
River Hydrographic Basin. Iron was shown to be a suitable 
reference element for definition of a regional geochemical 
baseline (RGB) for the trace metals. Metals in sediments 
from sites 3, 4, 7-12 and 14-19 were mainly derived from 
natural origins, and could be used to define the RGB.

Enrichment factors and geoaccumulation indices were 
calculated for each metal by dividing its ratio to the reference 
element by the same ratio found for the RGB. Calculated EF 
values showed that sediments from sites 1, 5 and 13 could 
be considered contaminated by Pb, Cr and Cu, respectively. 
The sediments were classified as unpolluted to moderately 
polluted, according to the Igeo. A value of Igeo higher than 1 
was only obtained for Cu at site 13 (near shipping activities), 
indicating that there was no large-scale Cu contamination of 
the sediments of the Sergipe River Basin.

Possible toxicity related to these metals was examined 
comparing sediment chemical data with TEC-PEC values. 
Results indicated that adverse effects on aquatic biota 
should rarely occur, with respect to the trace metals Cu, 
Pb, and Zn.

PCA clearly separated the sites into two groups: 
I (sites 1-3, 6, 9 and 10); II (sites 4, 5, 7 and 11-19). HCA 
confirmed the interpretations made from the PCA results.
