“Cooling breeze from a summer day

Hearing echoes from your heart

Learning how to recompose the words

Let time just fly

Joyful sea-gulls roaming on the shore

Not a single note will sound

Raise my head after I dry my face

Let time just fly

Recalling, retreating

Returning, retrieving

A small talk your missing

More clever but older now

A leader, a learner

A lawful beginner

A lodger of lunacy

So lucid in the jungle

A helper, a sinner

A scarecrow’s agonizing smile

Oh! Minutes go round and round

Inside my head

Oh! My chest will now explode

Falling into pieces

Rain breaks on the ground

One minute forever

A sinner regretting

My vulgar misery ends

Ride the winds of a brand new day

High where mountain’s stand

Found my hope and pride again

Rebirth of a man

Time to fly.”
(Rebirth, Angra)

Abstract

The research on alternative technologies aims at the development of
environmentally-friendly thermal systems with a lower energy consump-
tion. In this context, magnetic refrigeration at near-room temperature
stands out as a promising alternative technology for the development
of refrigeration systems.

The present thesis advances theoretical and experimental analyses of
passive and active magnetic regenerators aiming at applications in re-
frigeration systems. The study of passive regenerators will provide the
basis for the assessment of the active matrices. Therefore, the thesis
work was carried out along two research fronts. The first is concerned
with the study of the thermal-hydraulic performance of passive regen-
erators through an evaluation of their effectiveness and viscous losses.
The second front is dedicated to the evaluation of active magnetic re-
generators as part of a refrigeration cycle, by means of an analysis of
the system cooling capacity, temperature difference between the ther-
mal reservoirs and coefficient of performance.

Both fronts have experimental and numerical approaches. In the ex-
perimental part, an apparatus for the evaluation of passive and active
magnetic regenerators was designed and built. Different matrix ge-
ometries (parallel plates, pin arrays and packed beds of spheres) were
evaluated in terms of their thermal performances. In the numerical
analysis, a mathematical model based on the finite volume method
was developed to solve the transient one-dimensional forms of the mo-
mentum equation for the fluid flow through the porous matrix and
the energy equations for the fluid and solid phases. Different types of
losses were included in the model, such as the internal demagnetizing
field, heat transfer to the surroundings, axial heat conduction and void
volume losses. Finally, a methodology to optimize passive and active
regenerators based on the Entropy Generation Minimization theory was
proposed and implemented in the numerical model.

1 Introduction

Refrigeration is concerned with the cooling of bodies or fluids to tem-
peratures lower than those available in the surroundings at a particular
time and place (GOSNEY, 1982). The development of cooling systems
expanded the possibilities in food storage, transport, conservation and
thermal comfort. Certainly, refrigerators and air-conditioning systems
were fundamental to the evolution of the quality of life enjoyed in our
society.

The most conventional cooling technology is based on the mechanical
compression and expansion of a vapor. The first compressors and re-
frigerators were over-designed, heavy and inefficient. However, vapor
compression technologies experienced numerous developments in the
20th century. As a result, the compressors used today in a range of do-
mestic and commercial applications are small, inexpensive and efficient,
thus making the mechanical compression of refrigerants the dominant
technology for a host of cooling applications.

Over the last three decades or so, environmental and energy policies
are being imposed to restrict the use of non-environmentally friendly
substances and low efficiency conversion systems. As a result, the use
of CFC and HCFC refrigerants that contribute to global warming and
ozone layer depletion has been suspended in several countries (UNITED
NATIONS, 2015).

Possible replacements of the non-environmentally friendly substances
are the natural refrigerants, such as CO2 (R-744) and hydrocarbons,
but these may have some disadvantages in terms of energy efficiency
(GIROTTO et al., 2004) or undesired physical-chemical properties such
as flammability. Therefore, new technologies that are not based on
the use of harmful fluids and are capable of developing thermodynamic
efficiencies at similar levels are being sought. In this scenario, magnetic



2 1 Introduction

refrigeration is the one of the leading contenders among the so-called
emerging technologies for the development of cooling and heat pumping
systems.

Magnetic cooling does not rely on volatile refrigerants, as a magnetic
solid material is used as the refrigerant and an aqueous solution is the
heat transfer agent between the magnetic material and the thermal
reservoirs. Magnetic coolers can operate at low absolute pressures, are
conceptually simpler than vapor compression equipment, since they can
be designed with fewer moving parts to generate less mechanical vibra-
tion and noise (YU et al., 2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 2006;
GSCHNEIDNER JR.; PECHARSKY, 2008). Magnets can, in principle, be
recycled or reused in more advanced refrigerators, which constitutes an
economic benefit compared to other technologies. Finally, and more
importantly, magnetic refrigeration has the potential to be thermody-
namically more efficient, since it is, in principle, easier to perform a
reversible magnetization of a magnetic material than a reversible com-
pression of a gas or vapor. As will be discussed later, the magnetocaloric
effect is reversible.

Fig. 1.1 compares the Carnot cycles for gas compression and magnetic
refrigeration. The gas compression system is based on the fundamental
processes of isentropic compression, (0)-(1), and expansion, (2)-(3),
between the hot and cold reservoirs. Heat is removed isothermally
from a cold reservoir (at TC), (3)-(0), and rejected isothermally at the
hot reservoir (at TH), (1)-(2). The difference between QH and QC is
equal to the net mechanical work transferred to the system.

The magnetic cooling system is based on the fundamental process of
adiabatic magnetization, (0)-(1), and demagnetization, (2)-(3). In this
case, changes in magnetic flux density (?B) are responsible for es-
tablishing a temperature difference between the hot and cold reser-
voirs, at TH and TC, respectively. Similarly, the difference between
QH and QC is equal to the net magnetic work transfer to the system
(STEYERT, 1978; KITANOVSKI; EGOLF, 2006). The temperature varia-
tion of the solid magnetic material when the external magnetic flux den-
sity is changed under adiabatic conditions is called the Magnetocaloric
Effect (MCE).

Vapor compression systems can generate temperature spans between
the hot and cold reservoirs of the order of 40 to 70 K, which corre-
spond to pressure changes between 10 and 20 bar for most refrigerants.
These are typical operating conditions for the majority of compres-

sors in vapor compression systems. On the other hand, the MCE is
of the order of a few degrees Kelvin, even for large magnetic flux den-
sity variations. For example, the benchmark magnetocaloric material
for near room temperature applications, gadolinium (Gd), has a peak
MCE around 15 K for a ?B of 7.5 T (DAN´KOV et al., 1998). At a more
realistic operating condition, ?B is expected to be around 1.0 T, for
which the peak MCE is about 3.0 K (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009). There-
fore, even for large magnetic flux densities variations, the best known
magnetocaloric materials are not capable of providing temperature dif-
ferences compatible with those observed in gas or vapor compression
technologies.

To overcome this thermodynamic limitation, magnetic cooling systems
are based on regenerative cycles, in which the solid refrigerant is as-
sembled as a regenerative matrix, and a heat transfer fluid is used as
a thermal exchange medium between the refrigerant and the cold and
hot reservoirs. As a result of the intermittent heat transfer between the
solid matrix and the fluid during processes in an appropriate thermo-
magnetic cycle, such as the Brayton Cycle, the regenerator amplifies
the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs (tem-
perature span). This type of regenerator is called the Active Magnetic
Regenerator (AMR) (BARCLAY; STEYERT, 1982). Tura (2005) obtained



4 1 Introduction

experimentally a temperature span of 50 K for a ?B of 2.0 T in an
AMR composed of Gd-alloys for which the peak MCE is approximately
6.0 K for the same ?B (i.e., a gain factor of eight or so for the tem-
perature span).

The use of thermal regenerators in magnetic cooling cycles brings about
several technical challenges. The first one is the manufacture complex-
ity of the magnetocaloric material in an appropriate geometry that can
be used as a regenerative matrix, such as spheres, parallel plates, wire
meshes or pin arrays. Secondly, the operational complexity is increased,
as complex sealing and flow distribution systems are required to gen-
erate oscillating or bidirectional flows through the regenerative matrix
(KUPPAN, 2000). Additionally, matrices are compact porous media
which, when processing an aqueous heat transfer fluid, may cause a
dramatic increase in viscous losses and pumping power.

Single-phase heat transfer between the process fluid (thermal agent)
in the regenerator and in the heat exchangers connected to the ther-
mal reservoirs increases the system irreversibilities due to sensible heat
transfer with a finite temperature difference. Thus, bigger heat trans-
fer surface areas are required in both, hot and cold, heat exchangers,
which increases the geometric complexity and the viscous losses.

Other technical challenges are related to the magnetic field genera-
tion. Joule heating of the magnetic circuit together with restrictions
to magnetic flux densities in excess of 2 T due to health and safety
issues (e.g., in domestic applications) limit the range of possibilities for
the magnetic field generation to rare earth permanent magnet circuits
(KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). Monfared et al. (2014) presented a compre-
hensive life cycle assessment of both magnetic and vapor-compression
refrigerators. They concluded that the designation of environmentally
friendly technology is questionable when considerable amounts of rare
earth metals are required to build a magnetic refrigerator. Clearly, the
high costs involved in the use of rare earth based permanent magnets
and magnetocaloric materials is another important economic limita-
tion.

The above discussion exposed some of the main limitations and chal-
lenges for the technological development of magnetic cooling systems.
In this context, a specific research project on thermal regeneration can
contribute significantly to the field of magnetic refrigeration. Parame-
ters such as matrix (bed) geometry, casing geometry/dimensions, and
the identification and minimization of different types of losses (thermal,



1.1 Objectives and Contributions 5

hydrodynamic and magnetic losses) must be investigated systematically
in order to improve and optimize the existing magnetic cooling devices
or design more efficient ones. A list of desirable characteristics in a
thermal regenerator for magnetic cooling applications is as follows:

? High thermal effectiveness due to low heat transfer irreversibili-
ties;

? Small viscous losses, resulting in simpler and smaller pumping
systems;

? Small magnetic losses, resulting in a large MCE;

? Compactness, resulting in lower torques, less mechanical losses
and smaller motors. As a result, lighter magnetic circuits can be
employed, using smaller quantities of rare earth-based materials.

1.1 Objectives and Contributions

The objective of the present thesis is to investigate experimentally and
numerically the behavior of active magnetic regenerators in order to
optimize their performance, considering different matrix geometries.

To accomplish this objective, an evaluation of both, passive and active,
matrices with identical geometries and operating at the same condi-
tions was carried out. In passive regenerators, the magnetic field is
not present, which facilitates the differentiation between losses that are
common to both types of regenerators and those that are exclusive
to active magnetic regenerators. This way, experiments with passive
matrices may help to quantify the influence of the porous medium ge-
ometry on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the regenerator inde-
pendently of losses taking place in the presence of a change in magnetic
field (i.e., magnetic losses).

To enable the development of this research work, the following actions
were pursued:

? Design and build a versatile experimental apparatus to evaluate
passive and active magnetic regenerators, for a variety of operat-
ing conditions and matrix geometries;



6 1 Introduction

? Develop a one-dimensional, transient finite volume-based numer-
ical model to evaluate and optimize the performance of passive
and active magnetic regenerators.

The project was divided in two stages. The first stage involved the
study of the thermal-hydraulic aspects of oscillating-flow passive regen-
erators. The impact of the regenerative matrix geometry on the heat
transfer and on the viscous and thermal losses were studied experimen-
tally and numerically using conventional materials for the regenerator
matrix (e.g., stainless steel). The following specific objectives have been
defined for this part of the study:

? Perform experimental tests to determine the time-dependent tem-
perature and pressure change behaviors in regenerators filled with
different regenerative matrix geometries (packed spheres, pin ar-
rays and parallel plates). The independent operating parameters
are the mass flow rate and the frequency;

? Compare the experimental results for the different matrix geome-
tries in terms of (i) the regenerator effectiveness as a function of
the number of transfer units and (ii) the pressure drop as a func-
tion of the particle Reynolds number. Analysis such as these help
to quantify the influence of thermal-hydraulic losses, such as axial
conduction and viscous friction, on the regenerator performance;

? Perform numerical simulations in order to reproduce the experi-
mental results;

? With the assistance of the numerical model, identify the appro-
priate closure relationships for fluid flow and heat transfer for
each specific regenerative matrix geometry;

? Propose an optimization procedure for passive regenerators based
on the Entropy Generation Minimization theory (BEJAN, 1995)
combined with the Performance Evaluation Criteria of Webb and
Kim (2005).

The second stage was concerned with the thermal-hydraulic and mag-
netic aspects of active magnetic regenerators, thus enabling a more
in-depth analysis of the impact of the magnetic losses on the AMR
performance. The specific objectives for this part of the study are as
follows:



1.2 Outline of the Thesis 7

? Perform experimental tests to determine the time-dependent tem-
perature and pressure change behaviors in active magnetic regen-
erators filled with different matrix geometries (packed spheres,
pin arrays and parallel plates). The time-dependent torque re-
quired to rotate the magnet system is also evaluated experimen-
tally. The independent operating parameters are the mass flow
rate, frequency and the thermal load applied on the cold side;

? Incorporate the thermo-magnetic phenomena in the numerical
model and perform numerical simulations to reproduce the ex-
perimental results;

? Compare the experimental results for the different matrix geome-
tries in terms of the temperature span, cooling capacity, coeffi-
cient of performance and second-law efficiency. Analysis such as
these help to quantify the influence of both, thermal-hydraulic
and magnetic, losses on the AMR performance;

? Propose an optimization procedure for active magnetic regenera-
tors based on the Entropy Generation Minimization theory (BE-
JAN, 1995) combined with the Performance Evaluation Criteria
of Webb and Kim (2005).

the thermal performances of the different matrix geometries. A de-
tailed accounting of the passive regenerator losses (e.g., void volume,
entrance losses) is carried out. Chapter 6 - Active Magnetic Regener-
ators - presents the experimental data and numerical results for the

2 Fundamentals and State
of the Art of Thermal
Regenerators

In 1816, Robert Stirling built the first regenerative hot air engine.
Later, in 1834, it was suggested by John Herschel that regenerative
engines could be used as refrigerators. More than 100 years later, in
1959, Gifford and McMahon developed a regenerative cryogenic refrig-
erator to cool infrared detectors and laser amplifiers (ACKERMANN,
1997). Nearly two decades later, Brown (1976) developed the first near
room-temperature magnetic heat pump and, a few years after that,
Barclay and Steyert (1982) patented the active magnetic regenerator.
However, a greater interest in magnetic cooling near the room tempera-
ture emerged mainly after 1997 with the discovery of special alloys with
the so-called ‘giant’ magnetocaloric effect by Pecharsky and Gschnei-
dner Jr. (1997a). After that, several developments in magnetocaloric
materials and magnetic cooling systems have been reported in the open
literature (YU et al., 2010; SMITH et al., 2012; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015).

This chapter reviews the fundamentals of thermal regeneration, with a
special emphasis on the coupling of regenerator modeling with the mag-
netocaloric effect associated with the solid matrix. This combination
results in a unique regenerator type, the active magnetic regenerator
(AMR), which is one of the focal points of this thesis. After presenting
the basics of the AMR cycle, some approaches to optimize AMRs are
reviewed.



10 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

2.1 Applications of Thermal Regenerators

Regenerators are storage-type heat exchangers in which hot and cold
fluid streams flow in alternating directions through a porous matrix,
giving rise to intermittent heat transfer between the solid and the
fluid. The regenerative matrix (or simply matrix) is the porous me-
dium composed by solid material processed in a specified bed geome-
try (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997;
KUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009). Thermal
regenerators have several industrial applications, such as waste heat
recovery in gas turbine or steam power plants and as internal heat
exchangers in thermodynamic cycles (KUPPAN, 2000).

In cooling technologies, the applications of regenerative heat exchang-
ers can be classified according to the temperature range and type of
heat transfer fluid. Gases are much more common than liquids and
are the thermal agents in a number of cryogenic and low-temperature
cycles, such as the Stirling, pulse-tube, thermoacoustic, Gifford- McMa-
hon and Vuillemier cycles (KUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). Re-
generators that use liquids as thermal fluids are encountered in near
room-temperature conditions involving some magnetocaloric and elec-
trocaloric cooling cycles (OZBOLT et al., 2014; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015).

During the hot-to-cold blow (or simply hot blow), the fluid at a higher
temperature exchanges heat with the solid phase, warming up the ma-
trix that stores thermal energy from the fluid phase. In the cold-to-hot
blow (or simply cold blow), the matrix releases the stored energy as
heat, warming up the fluid. As the matrix is alternately exposed to the
hot and cold streams, its temperature and that of the fluid vary as a
function of time. Thus, a so-called periodically developed condition is
observed after a number of cycles, in which the variations of temper-
ature with time (for the solid and fluid phases) are the same during
successive cycles.

The duration of the time periods of the hot and cold blows should al-
low for heat transfer between the solid and the fluid at every position
of the matrix. Thus, temperature, pressure, flow velocity and ther-
mophysical properties are essentially both time and space dependent.
This distinguishes regenerators from recuperators, where in the latter
heat is transferred between two continual fluid streams across a fixed
boundary. At steady state, the properties of both streams depend only
on the spatial position (KUPPAN, 2000).



2.2 Types of Regenerators 11

Due to the intermittent heat transfer and alternating flow condition, the
following are desirable characteristics in a regenerator matrix (SHAH;
SEKULIC?, 2003; KUPPAN, 2000):

1. High volumetric heat capacity;

2. Compact, for minimum volume and reduction of the void space;

3. Large thermal conductance, which can be achieved with a large
heat transfer area per unit of volume and/or a high convective
(interstitial) heat transfer coefficient;

4. High permeability and non-obstructed porous media to minimize
the viscous losses;

5. Axially discontinuous and/or highly thermally resistant in the
flow direction to minimize axial heat conduction.

2.2 Types of Regenerators

There are two basic regenerator designs: the fixed-bed (or stationary)
and the rotary, as presented in Fig. 2.1. To perform the alternating
flow periods, in the fixed-bed the hot and cold streams must be contin-
uously alternated by means of directional valves, such as rotary, linear
or solenoid valves and check valves. On the other hand, in the case of
a rotary regenerator the regenerative matrix must be rotated periodi-
cally into and out of the fixed streams (KUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?,
2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).

Fig. 2.1(a) illustrates the single matrix fixed-bed regenerator. In this
case, the overall cycle is discontinuous, since the heat interactions with
the thermal reservoirs occur only in a fraction of the total cycle period.
The hot blow period takes a fraction of the total period, where the
black lines represent the flow direction from the hot to the cold reser-
voir, passing through the regenerator. Next, the fluid exiting the regen-
erator interacts with the cold reservoir. The remaining period fraction
is dedicated to the cold blow, where by means of switch (rotary, linear
or solenoid) valves or a double effect pump, the flow direction is alter-
nated (black lines), and the fluid exiting the regenerator now interacts
with the hot reservoir. To have a continuous cycle in stationary regen-
erators, multiple beds can be employed in parallel. In this case, the

heat interactions with the cold and hot reservoirs are performed during
the entire cycle. Fig. 2.1(b) illustrates the case of a multiple fixed-
bed regenerator, where the alternating flow in the matrix is achieved
by changing the position of a switch (rotary, linear or solenoid) valve
or a double effect pump. The rotary type regenerator is presented in
Fig. 2.1(c), where the hot and cold streams are generated by rotating
the matrix, thus ensuring a continuous cycle. In this case, the heat
interactions with the cold and hot reservoirs are performed during the
whole cycle.

While fixed-bed regenerators are simpler to build and maintain, and



2.3 Merits of Regenerators 13

are less prone to leakages, they are usually less compact (smaller sur-
face area per unit volume) and are more difficult to operate at high
frequencies than rotary-type regenerators.

2.3 Merits of Regenerators

A discussion about the desirable characteristics and types of regenera-
tors enables highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of regenera-
tors compared to other kinds of heat exchangers, such as fluid-fluid heat
exchangers (recuperators). The main advantages are follows: (KUPPAN,
2000; KREITH, 2000; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009)

1. Simplicity: a regenerator matrix can be as simple as a bed of
particles, eliminating the need for complex accessories, such as
elaborated gaskets and headers;

2. Compactness: regenerators can be designed for a large heat trans-
fer area per unit matrix volume;

3. Cost: it is possible to obtain a thermal effectiveness approaching
unity using inexpensive solid materials in a compact arrangement;

In contrast, the following disadvantages can be listed:

1. Large matrix heat capacity: to achieve a high thermal effective-
ness, the heat capacity of the solid matrix has to be larger than
that of the working fluid. This is a special concern when the
working fluid is an aqueous solution, which may result in a heavy
regenerator;

2. Friction losses: highly compact regenerators (i.e., with a large
surface area density) can produce high viscous losses;

3. Alternating flow: changes of flow direction (in fixed-bed units) re-
sult in additional flow irreversibilities, increasing the regenerator
pressure drop;

4. Leakages: the performance of regenerators is very sensitive to
leakages, which may result in undesired mixing of the streams
(SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). Pressure leakages are caused by pressure



14 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

differences between the hot and cold streams and are of special
concern in gas regenerators. Carryover leakages in a gas regen-
erator are the transport of trapped fluid in the void spaces of
the matrix to the other fluid side due to matrix rotation. In a
fixed-bed regenerator, the carryover leakage corresponds to the
fluid that changes its direction outside the regenerator, i.e., in
the headers and/or in the spaces between each thermal reservoir
and the nearest regenerator end (see Fig. 2.1(a)). Also known
as void (or dead) volume losses, carryover losses in single fixed-
bed regenerators impose a penalty on the regenerator thermal
performance as they correspond to a fluid volume that has been
displaced but does not interact thermally with the thermal reser-
voirs, thereby producing neither a cooling nor a heating effect at
the reservoirs.

2.4 Thermal Fluids Used in Regenerators

2.4.1 Gases

As mentioned above, cryogenics is the main field of application of ther-
mal regenerators that employ gases as heat transfer fluids. Ackermann
(1997) presents a comprehensive discussion of the theory and design
of regenerative heat exchangers for cryogenic applications. The Stir-
ling cryocooler (piston-displacer configuration), illustrated in Fig. 2.2,
is used in many cryogenic applications, including cooling of spacecraft
instruments, infrared thermal imaging systems and superconducting
elements. Ibrahim and Tew Jr (2012) reviewed the latest developments
in regenerator research, from modeling and computational fluid dynam-
ics (CFD) analyses to applications of Stirling regenerators.

Noble gases, such as helium (He), are the preferred thermal fluid in gas
regenerators for their high specific heat capacity ratio. The Stirling cy-
cle starts with the compression, (1)-(2), of the gas by the power piston,
while heat, QH, is rejected to the external ambient to achieve a near
isothermal compression, at TH. Next, in process (2)-(3), the displacer
piston moves the high-pressure gas through the regenerator where the
hot gas releases heat to the matrix and is cooled to a lower operating
temperature. This process occurs approximately at a constant volume.
The cold high-pressure gas coming from the regenerator is expanded,
in process (3)-(4), by the coupled motion of the power and displacer

pistons, while the heat load, QC, is transferred to the gas from the
low-temperature region at the cold end of the cylinder to achieve a
near-isothermal expansion, at TC. Finally, in process (4)-(1), the cold
low-pressure gas flows back through the regenerator driven by the dis-
placer piston. The gas receives heat from the matrix and is warmed up
before returning to the initial condition (KREITH, 2000).

de Boer (1994, 1995) presented a thermodynamic analyses of pulse-
tube refrigerators with and without regenerators. The results led to
the conclusion that the use of a regenerator increases significantly the
heat removal per cycle, the coefficient of performance and the refriger-
ation (i.e., second-law) efficiency. These results show the importance
of the application of regenerators in thermodynamic cycles and can be
extended to clarify the importance of optimized regenerators design.



16 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

A number of experimental and numerical approaches have been devel-
oped to study the fluid flow and heat transfer in passive regenerators
working with gases under oscillating flow conditions (GEDEON; WOOD,
1996; JU et al., 1998; LEE et al., 1998; NAM; JEONG, 2005, 2006; CHEN
et al., 2007; CHA et al., 2008; JU; SHEN, 2009). The general objectives
of these works are to predict and correlate the friction factor and Nus-
selt number to overcome the inaccuracies of conventional models for
steady state, which tend to fail at high oscillating frequencies (&gt; 10
Hz). The prediction methods were developed for a range of different
geometries, such as wire meshes, parallel wires, tubes and plates, and
different porosities (generally higher than 0.6, which is usual for gas
applications).

2.4.2 Liquids

The application of liquids as thermal fluids in regenerators gained more
importance with the development of magneto and electrocaloric cooling
systems (OZBOLT et al., 2014; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). However, most
models available in the literature are based on relationships for steady-
state porous media, single blow or oscillating-flow regenerators that use
low Prandtl-number fluids, i.e., gases.

Marconnet (2007) designed and built a single-blow regenerator test
setup to study heat transfer in packed beds of spheres using water and
water-glycol mixtures as heat transfer fluids. The proposed approach
was to compare the experimental and the numerical time-dependent
temperature data to adjust the A and B constants of the Nusselt num-
ber correlation of Wakao and Kaguei (1982)1, given by,

Nu = A + BRe

Frischmann et al. (2008), Engelbrecht (2008) and Knauf et al. (2008)
used the same apparatus as Marconnet (2007) to evaluate the per-
formance of friction factor and Nusselt number correlations for packed
spheres. The general conclusion was that the Wakao and Kaguei (1982)
correlation overestimated the Nusselt number for aqueous solutions as

1Wakao and Kaguei (1982) derived their correlation from experimental results
that used gases as heat transfer fluid. A more in-depth discussion about the validity
of this correlation for aqueous fluids will be presented later in this thesis.



2.4 Thermal Fluids Used in Regenerators 17

heat transfer fluids at low Reynolds numbers (&amp;lt;100). On the other
hand, the well established correlation of MacDonald et al. (1979) for
the friction factor in packed bed porous media gave satisfactory results,
with deviations of the order of the experimental uncertainties.

Schopfer (2010) investigated both experimentally and theoretically the
thermal-hydraulic behavior of oscillating-flow regenerators using water
as the heat transfer fluid. Two different matrix geometries were studied:
packed beds of spheres and micro-channels. Schopfer (2010) proposed
a new Nusselt number correlation for both geometries in terms of a
dimensionless frequency known as the kinetic Reynolds number (SI-
MON; SEUME, 1988). The Nusselt number results for the packed bed of
spheres exhibited different trends with respect to the single-blow exper-
imental results of Engelbrecht (2008). On the other hand, the friction
factor results showed a fair agreement with the model predictions, of
the order of the experimental uncertainties.

Engelbrecht et al. (2011) investigated the effects of porosity, corruga-
tion angle and the presence of dimples on the performance of parallel
plate regenerators. The plates were made of aluminum with 0.4 mm
thickness. The experimental analysis was carried out for a range of
cycle periods and utilization values. The best performance was found
for a 90o corrugated plate regenerator. Also, a decrease of the porosity
by reducing the plate spacing did not result in a significant increase
in performance, although the heat transfer coefficient was expected to
increase with the plate spacing.

Scarpa et al. (2012) developed a Kalman filter-based inverse method
and applied it to numerically simulated experiments to determine the
interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient in regenerators using liq-
uids. A one-dimensional model was used to describe the heat transfer in
the regenerator. The identification (reconstruction) of the heat transfer
coefficient was based on the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. The
authors demonstrated that there was an optimal operating frequency of
the inlet fluid temperature at which the heat transfer coefficient could
be determined with the greatest precision (minimum standard devia-
tion). At the time of the study, the model had not been applied to
real data and the influences of parameters such as mass flow rate and
effective conductivities of both the fluid and solid matrix had not been
quantified.

Trevizoli et al. (2013, 2014) performed experiments with passive regen-
erators using water as the thermal fluid. The study aimed at quanti-



18 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

fying the fluid pumping power and the regenerator heat transfer effec-
tiveness as a function of operating parameters such as frequency and
utilization factor. Three different packed beds were used: 1-mm diam-
eter stainless steel spheres, 0.5-mm diameter lead spheres and 0.5-mm
diameter gadolinium spheres. For equivalent ranges of utilization, all
matrices presented a high effectiveness, with the lead matrix showing
the highest effectiveness and the smallest pumping power, due to a
combination of large surface area per unit volume (small particle di-
ameter) and low mass flow rates (large NTU). However, due to the
low fluid velocities, the lead matrix was more susceptible to axial con-
duction losses. The gadolinium matrix exhibited a large effectiveness
imbalance between the cold and hot blows due to a strong variation of
the solid specific heat capacity with temperature. The Gd matrix also
exhibited the highest viscous losses due to the small particle size and
high superficial velocities, for the same utilization ranges.

Although the number of studies on the performance of passive regener-
ators using liquids has increased in the past decade, a systematic study
on the subject is still lacking. New data and improved models are there-
fore extremely valuable for the development of improved methods for
active magnetocaloric regenerators. Without the need to deal with the
magnetocaloric phenomena during the early stages of the development,
the test regenerators can be manufactured with more conventional ma-
terials, at a much lower cost. This enables evaluating other promising
regenerative matrix geometries for application in AMRs, such as paral-
lel plates, packed beds of spheres or irregular particles, and pin arrays.

2.5 The Ideal Regenerator

In a perfectly insulated regenerator with an infinite heat transfer (in-
terstitial) area, the fluid temperature exiting the cold end, Tf|CE, will
be equal to the temperature of the cold reservoir, TC. Conversely, the
fluid temperature exiting the hot end, Tf|HE, will be equal to the tem-
perature of the hot reservoir, TH. In this externally reversible situation,
the thermal effectiveness of the regenerator is 100%. However, this does
not guarantee the internal reversibility. In order for a regenerator to
be cast as ideal (internally reversible), the following hypotheses must
be fulfilled:



2.5 The Ideal Regenerator 19

1. Constant fluid and solid properties;

2. Constant flow velocity;

3. No fluid leakage;

4. Constant inlet fluid temperature;

5. Negligible thermal resistance in the transverse direction (normal
to the flow);

6. Infinite heat conduction resistance in the streamwise direction;

7. Uniform interstitial heat transfer coefficient2;

8. No losses to the surrounding and no mixing of streams;

9. Negligible thermal capacity of the fluid compared to that of the
solid matrix.

The latter assumption translates into the following relationship:

(mcp)|f
(mc)|s

&lt;&amp;lt;1 (2.2)

where c and cp are the specific heat capacities of the solid and fluid
phases, respectively, and m is the mass of each phase. The subscripts
‘s’ and ‘f’ stand for the solid and fluid phases, respectively.

Generally, for regenerators operating with gases, the thermal capacity
ratio constraint presented in Eq. (2.2) is easily fulfilled. Important ex-
ceptions are the helium cryogenic regenerators, for which at 6 K the
heat capacity of the fluid becomes one order of magnitude larger than
that of the matrix (ACKERMANN, 1997). On the other hand, in passive
and active magnetic regenerators using aqueous solutions as thermal
agents, Eq. (2.2) is hardly ever valid. For AMRs, the thermal capac-
ity ratio varies from 0.1 to much grater than 1 and, in general, the
performance peaks is around 1. In the AMR literature, the thermal ca-
pacity ratio is commonly referred to as the utilization factor (or simply
utilization) (NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).

2Ideally, the convective heat transfer coefficient should approach infinity.



20 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

The heat transfer in an ideal regenerator is modeled mathematically
by the following differential heat balances in the solid and fluid phases
(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):

(mc)|s
?Ts
?t

= hAHT(Ts ?Tf) (2.3)

0 = h
AHT
L

(Tf ?Ts) + (m?cp)|f
?Tf
?z

(2.4)

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, AHT is the heat
transfer area, L is the regenerator length, t is the time and m? is the
mass flow rate. Note that in the ideal regenerator the transient term in
the fluid energy equation can be neglected since the thermal capacity
of the fluid phase is small compared with the solid phase. The initial
and boundary conditions for this model are as follows:

? At t = 0, Ts = Ti, where Ti is a given initial temperature;

? For the hot blow: Tf|HE = TH at z = 0;

? For the cold blow: Tf|CE = TC at z = L.

The exact solution of Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) can be found in different
references. Schmidt and Willmott (1981) p. 20, presented a classical
solution based on the dimensionless time and length. In a different
approach, Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solved analytically the same
equation in terms of the NTU and utilization factor, which will be
presented in the next section.

2.6 Regenerator Design and Performance
Parameters

Regenerators are usually designed based on the following parameters
(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997):

1. Overall thermal conductance, UAHT, where U is the overall heat
transfer coefficient;



2.6 Regenerator Design and Performance Parameters 21

2. Temperatures of the cold and hot inlet streams, TC,in and TH,in;

3. Thermal capacity of the fluid during the hot and cold blows, CHB
and CCB, where C = m?cp;

4. Thermal capacity of the matrix ((mc)|s);

5. Operating frequency;

The performance of a regenerator is evaluated based on the average
outlet fluid temperatures at the cold and hot ends, T C,out and T H,out.
Undoubtedly, these outlet average temperatures are a function of the
design parameters listed above. However, the regenerator performance
is more commonly evaluated in terms of non-dimensional variables
(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997; SHAH;
SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).

Based on Eq. (2.2), the first dimensionless parameter to be defined is
the utilization factor, ?, which for a fixed bed regenerator is given by,

? =
m?cp?blow|f
mc|s

(2.5)

where ?blow is the time period of one blow. The utilization is the
ratio of the thermal capacity of the fluid phase flowing through the
regenerator during one blow (hot or cold) and the thermal capacity of
the regenerator solid matrix. As mentioned above, a good regenerator
must have a large matrix heat capacity so that it can store energy from
the fluid without changing temperature substantially (NELLIS; KLEIN,
2009).

The second dimensionless parameter is the number of heat transfer
units, NTU, which can be intuitively related to the thermal size of the
heat exchanger (SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):

NTU =
UAHT
C

?????
blow

(2.6)

In principle, as shown in Eq. (2.6), NTU can be evaluated separately
for the cold and hot blows. Additionally, regenerators can be evaluated
in terms of the modified number of transfer units, NTUo, given by,



22 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

Cmin

(2.7)

where

(2.8)

Although Eq. (2.8) indicates that the two convection thermal resis-
tances associated with each blow are connected in series, this is not
true for a regenerator, since there is no direct heat transfer between
the hot and cold streams. In the so-called balanced regenerator, the
mass flow rates of the cold and hot blows are identical and the hot and
cold blow periods are the same. Thus, the thermal capacity rates of the
cold and hot streams are identical, Cmin = CCB = CHB, and the NTU
is the same for both blows (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN,
1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):

NTUo =
NTU

2
(2.9)

In the present thesis, balanced flow conditions were used in all experi-
ments. Thus, the results will be always evaluated in terms of NTU.

The third and last non-dimensional parameter is the thermal effective-
ness, ?. The effectiveness is a measure of how good the real regen-
erator is when compared with a perfect regenerator subjected to the
same temperature difference between the thermal reservoirs (SCHMIDT;
WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS;
KLEIN, 2009). Thus:

? =
Qblow
Qmax

(2.10)

where Qblow is the actual amount of heat transferred from or to the ma-
trix in a given blow (hot or cold) and Qmax is the maximum possible
amount of heat transferred from or to the matrix in a perfect regener-
ator. Under balanced flow conditions, the thermal effectiveness can be
expressed in terms of the average outlet temperatures as follows:

?HB = 1 ?

(2.12)

Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solved analytically and numerically the
governing energy equations for ideal regenerators (Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4)).
Fig. 2.3 presents the results for the effectiveness as a function of NTU
and utilization for balanced and symmetric ideal regenerators. As can
be seen, only regenerators with an utilization lower than unity are
capable of reaching 100% effectiveness. This limit is reached earlier (i.e.,
smaller values of NTU) as the utilization approaches zero (negligible
thermal capacity of the fluid stream). For an utilization factor higher
than unity, the maximum achievable effectiveness is lower than 100%.
Therefore, it is not possible to attain perfect regeneration when the
thermal capacity of the fluid exceeds that of the matrix. Also, the
maximum achievable effectiveness is reached earlier (i.e., smaller values
of NTU) as the utilization factor increases above unity (ACKERMANN,
1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).

The ideal regenerator solution helps to understand the influence of the
basic design parameters on the actual regenerator performance. How-
ever, any real regenerator design must incorporate real effects and losses
in order to provide a true estimate of the performance of a real cooling
system. The following is a list of phenomena that must be accounted
for in the modeling of regenerators aiming at applications in magnetic
cooling:

1. Thermal capacity of the fluid phase so as to deal with regenerators
that use aqueous solutions as thermal agents;

2. Viscous dissipation, which may become significant in highly com-
pact regenerators with a large heat transfer area per unit of vol-
ume and a low porosity;

3. Axial (streamwise) heat conduction in the fluid and solid phases;

4. Variable thermophysical properties of the solid and fluid phases
with respect to temperature, pressure and magnetic flux density
(in the case of an active magnetic regenerator);

2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect

The Magnetocaloric Effect (MCE) is the thermal response of a mag-
netic material when subjected to a changing magnetic field. The his-
torical aspects of the MCE, including its discovery in 1917 by Weiss
and Piccard are presented and discussed in the review article by Smith
(2013).

Physically, the MCE is a manifestation of the entropy variation of the
material due to the coupling of the magnetic moments in the material
with the magnetic field. A suitable engineering approximation for the
majority of magnetocaloric materials is to assume that the specific en-
tropy of the solid material, s, is the sum of three main contributions:
electronic, sele, lattice, slat, and magnetic, smag. sele and slat are as-



2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 25

sumed to depend only on the temperature, while smag is a function
of the temperature and the external magnetic flux density3 (TISHIN;
SPICHKIN, 2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1999; PECHARSKY et
al., 2001; SMITH et al., 2012):

s(T,B) = smag(T,B) + sele(T) + slat(T) (2.13)

When the external magnetic flux density on the solid magnetocaloric
material is changed from B0 to B1, the resulting MCE can be quan-
tified in terms of the two thermodynamic process presented in the
temperature-specific entropy (T-s) diagram in Fig. 2.4.

Jr. (1999).

3In general, the applied magnetic flux density, B, is represented by the applied
magnetic field, H. These quantities are related by B = µ0H, where µ0 is the
magnetic permeability of the vacuum and, essentially, represent the same quantity.
To be consistent with the theoretical formalism, in the present thesis, the magnetic
flux density will be used.



26 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

If the magnetic flux density is varied under isothermal conditions, the
lattice and electronic contributions to the total entropy do not change,
and the MCE is characterized by the total entropy variation from s0 to
s1, which is proportional to the magnetic entropy variation as follows:

?smag(T, ?B) ? ?s(T, ?B) = s1(T,B) ?s0(T,B) (2.14)

On the other hand, if the magnetic flux density is varied under adi-
abatic conditions, the total entropy remains constant. Thus, the re-
sulting magnetic entropy variation is thermically compensated by the
electronic and lattice entropies and, as a result, the temperature of the
materials changes from T0 to T1:

??smag(T,B) = ?sele(T) + ?slat(T) (2.15)

2.7.1 Thermodynamics of the MCE

The isothermal entropy variation, also referred in the literature as the
magnetic entropy variation, ?smag(T, ?B), can be evaluated by the
following Maxwell relationship that relates entropy and the specific
magnetization, ?, which are both functions of temperature and mag-
netic flux density:

(
?s

)
T

Integration of Eq. (2.16) leads to:

?s(T, ?B) =

? B1

The entropy can also be related to the specific heat capacity (c) by:

(

T
(2.18)



2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 27

Eq. (2.18) can be integrated to determine the entropy change if the
specific heat capacity as a function of temperature and magnetic flux
density is known. Thus:

?s(T, ?B) =

? T

[
c(B1,T) ? c(B0,T)

At constant pressure, volume and composition, the entropy can be

For a reversible adiabatic (i.e., isentropic) process, substituting Eqs.

dT = ?
T

c(T,B)

(
??

?T

Integration of Eq. (2.21) results in the adiabatic temperature variation,
?Tad, which is formally defined as:

?Tad(T, ?B) = T1(s0(T1,B1)) ?T0(s0(T0,B0)) (2.22)

Thus, upon integration one has:

?Tad(T, ?B) = ?
? B1
B0

Since the MCE depends on the temperature and on the intensity of the
magnetic flux density variation, it presents a single peak around the

transition temperature where
(

?T

)
is maximum. This temperature

transition is called the Curie Temperature, TCurie (TISHIN; SPICHKIN,
2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1999; PECHARSKY et al., 2001;
SMITH et al., 2012). Fig. 2.5 illustrates the behavior of ?Tad and cH (the
specific heat capacity at constant magnetic field) of gadolinium (SID-



28 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

DIKOV et al., 2005), for which TCurie was about 295 K in that particular
set of experiments. For gadolinium, at low magnetic flux densities, the
Curie Temperature has been reported within the range of 290 to 297
K (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009), which largely depends on the level of purity
of the sample.

2.7.2 The Reversibility of the MCE

Magnetocaloric materials with a continuous magnetic phase transition
at the Curie Temperature exhibit a reversible magnetocaloric effect
(NIELSEN et al., 2010). The reversibility of the MCE has been demon-
strated experimentally based on direct measurements of ?Tad in Gd
samples (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012). Fig. 2.6 shows
the sample temperature when it is initially magnetized and then de-
magnetized a few moments later.

Starting with the sample at zero external magnetic flux density, and
the initial temperature T0 around 293.15 K, the sample is magnetized
adiabatically and its temperature increases to T1 = T0 +?Tad(T0, ?B).
In the case illustrated in Fig. 2.6, T1 is around 297 K and ?Tad,mag is
about 3.8 K. After the adiabatic demagnetization, the temperature
dropped to T2 = T1 + ?Tad(T1, ?B). Experimentally, T2 was observed
to be very close to T0, and ?Tad,demag was about -3.8 K. Thus, in
simple mathematical terms (NIELSEN et al., 2010):

MCE in Gd. The change in magnetic flux density was approximately
1.65 T. Adapted from Trevizoli et al. (2012).

The result described above can be explained on the grounds of the
reversibility of MCE under conditions of zero heat transfer between
the sample and the surroundings. Neglecting any kind of internal ir-
reversibility (homogeneous material, uniform temperature variations),
the system is expected to perform a cycle and return to the original
state (i.e., zero total entropy variation) with zero entropy generation
(TREVIZOLI et al., 2012). As a result, a distinct temperature shift is ob-
served when comparing the ?Tad,mag and ?Tad,demag curves as a func-
tion of temperature. Fig. 2.7 shows the direct measurement results of
?Tad under adiabatic magnetization and demagnetization. The exper-
imental results for demagnetization are compared with the theoretical
prediction using Eq. (2.24). This allows verification of the reversibil-
ity of the MCE, as distinct peaks are observed at around 293 K for

2.7.3 Magnetocaloric Materials

The MCE is an intrinsic property of all magnetic materials, basically
differing from each other with respect to the magnitudes of the entropy
and temperature changes and the Curie temperature. Fig. 2.8 shows
a comparison of the magnetocaloric properties of different materials
applicable in low- and room-temperature cooling (GSCHNEIDNER JR. et
al., 2000, 2005).

According to Rowe et al. (2005b), for applications around room tem-
perature, the ?Tad of magnetocaloric materials must be greater than
2 K/T. Nevertheless, other important properties should be considered,
such as (YU et al., 2003; TURA, 2005; GSCHNEIDNER JR.; PECHARSKY,
2008):

dner Jr. et al. (2005).

? MCE as large as possible over a broad temperature range, to
maximize the cooling capacity and the temperature span;

? Minimum thermal and magnetic hysteresis;

? Large specific heat capacity to increase the thermal mass of the
regenerative matrix;

? High thermal conductivity to improve the regenerator effective-
ness;

? Chemical stability to avoid corrosion;

? Large electrical resistance to avoid eddy currents;

? Good mechanical properties to facilitate the manufacturing pro-
cess;

? Low cost.

Gadolinium (Gd) is the benchmark material for applications around
room temperature. Since the discovery of the ‘giant’ MCE in Gd5(Ge,Si)
alloys (PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1997b), several different sys-
tems with large MCE have been reported, of which the most promising



32 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

ones are the La(Fe,Si) and MnFe-based alloys (BRU?CK et al., 2008).
Table 2.1 presents some important properties and characteristics of
promising magnetocaloric materials compared with Gd.

One of the most complex characteristics of all magnetocaloric materi-
als is the dependence of the MCE and the specific heat capacity with
respect to temperature and magnetic field. Regarding the MCE de-
pendence, it is highest at the Curie temperature and decreases as the
temperature gradually deviates from TCurie, as shown in Fig. 2.9. To
illustrate this, an AMR operating with a hypothetical material with a
temperature span of 70 K, where TC = 253 K and TH = 323 K, is shown
in Fig. 2.9(a). The MCE at TCurie is ?6.5 K, and decreases to ?2.5
K close to the cold end and to ?1.5 K close to the hot end. To avoid
this reduction of the MCE and achieve better performances, different
magnetocaloric materials with different values of TC can be combined
sequentially in the regenerator in order to maintain locally a MCE as
large as possible, as shown in Fig. 2.9(b). Several authors explored
the concept of multi-material regenerators (HASHIMOTO et al., 1987;
SMAI?LI; CHAHINE, 1997; OKAMURA et al., 2006; HIRANO et al., 2010).
Tura (2005) observed an increase of the maximum temperature span
(zero thermal load) from ?20 K using a single-layer Gd regenerator to
?50 K for a multi-layer regenerator composed by layers of Gd85Er15,
Gd74Tb26 and Gd. An identical magnetic field change was applied in
the two situations.

Regarding the specific heat capacity, there is a strong dependence with
respect to the applied magnetic flux density and temperature, as shown
in Fig. 2.10 for gadolinium. The major complicating element associated

with this is the need to take the temperature and flux density depen-
dence into account in the mathematical modeling of AMRs. As pointed
out by several authors (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014), the
local heat transfer in the regenerative matrix can be severely influenced
by changes in specific heat capacity, which has obvious consequences
to the regenerator performance.



34 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

2.8 Active Magnetic Regenerators

2.8.1 The AMR Cycle

Magnetic refrigeration systems can be built according to different ther-
modynamic cycles, such as the Carnot, Ericsson, Stirling and Brayton
cycles (KITANOVSKI; EGOLF, 2006; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). However,
since the MCE is small, i.e., of the order of 3 K/T at low magnetic flux
densities for the current magnetocaloric materials, large temperature
spans cannot be achieved, unless some kind of thermal regeneration is
used. In the active magnetic regenerator (AMR), the magnetocaloric
material is employed as a solid regenerative matrix so as to amplify
the temperature span by exchanging heat with a thermal agent (heat
transfer fluid) (BARCLAY; STEYERT, 1982).

Regenerative cycles enable achieving large temperature spans and large
cooling capacities. The Brayton cycle is the most common thermo-
magnetic regenerative cooling cycle, and is schematically presented in
Fig. 2.11. The following idealized steps, shown in a T-S diagram in
Fig. 2.12, make up the idealized thermo-magnetic Brayton cooling cycle
(ROWE et al., 2005a):

1. Adiabatic magnetization: by changing adiabatically the magnetic
field applied on the matrix, the total entropy of the magnetic solid
remains constant. However, the decrease in magnetic entropy due
to the magnetic field variation is compensated by an increase in
the lattice and electronic entropies. As a result, the tempera-
ture of the magnetic material increases, which characterizes the
magnetocaloric effect (MCE).

2. Constant magnetic field cold blow: after the adiabatic magnetiza-
tion, cold fluid (at TC) flows through the matrix, cools down the
solid phase (which releases heat to the fluid) and rejects heat to
a hot source at TH.

3. Adiabatic demagnetization: similarly to the adiabatic magnetiza-
tion, the demagnetization process reduces the temperature of the
solid material, which undergoes an adiabatic temperature change.

4. Constant magnetic field hot blow: hot fluid (at TH) returns through
the matrix, and the solid phase removes heat from the fluid phase,



2.8 Active Magnetic Regenerators 35

increasing the internal energy of the matrix. At the cold end, the
fluid absorbs heat from a cold source at TC.

ative Brayton cycle.

The efficiency of a magnetic active cooling system depends on the mag-
nitude of the MCE (refrigerating effect) and on the effectiveness of
the regenerative matrix. The MCE itself depends on the applied field
change, i.e., the higher the magnetic flux density variation the higher
the MCE, and on the magnetic properties of the magnetic material.
The effectiveness, in turn, depends on the solid phase thermophysical
properties, matrix geometry, thermal capacity, porosity and operating
parameters, such as frequency and flow velocity (ROWE et al., 2005a;
TURA; ROWE, 2011; NIELSEN et al., 2012; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014).

2.8.2 Numerical Modeling of AMRs

The mathematical modeling of AMRs is a multidisciplinary task, since
it involves the application of physical concepts in Thermodynamics,
Heat Transfer, Fluid Dynamics, Solid-State Physics and Magnetism.
The development of physically consistent models is fundamental to un-
derstand thermo-magnetic phenomena and to compute the regeneration

process in real AMRs prototypes. Mathematical models can also be ap-
plied in the optimization of regenerators, since there are several depen-
dent parameters that can be evaluated to achieve the best regenerator
performance, such as flow rate, frequency, magnetic field change and
profile (waveform), heat transfer fluid, regenerator geometry and mag-
netocaloric material. According to several modeling studies of active
magnetic regenerators, a complete mathematical model should include
the following (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012; KITANOVSKI
et al., 2015):

1. Detailed transient characteristics of the heat transfer, fluid flow
and applied magnetic field;

2. A robust numerical solver to solve the time- and space-dependent
energy equations, with acceptable convergence criteria;

3. Appropriate functions for the temperature and magnetic field de-
pendence of the thermo-magnetic properties, such as the specific
heat capacity and the adiabatic temperature change;

4. Appropriate models for estimating longitudinal heat conduction
effects, thermal losses to the surroundings (e.g., casing, magnets
and surrounding air) and viscous losses;

5. Flow maldistribution effects (e.g., by passing and channeling) and
carryover (void volume) losses;

6. Appropriate models for computing magnetic losses, such as de-
magnetizing fields, magnetic hysteresis and eddy currents.

In general, most models published in the literature do not take into
account all of the above losses. Nielsen et al. (2011) and Kitanovski et
al. (2015) carried out extensive reviews of the state of the art in AMR
modeling. Examples of models that are typical of the classes of models
developed in the literature are discussed next.

Burdyny (2012) developed a simplified transient 1-D model based on
the hypothesis of thermal equilibrium between the solid and fluid phases,
which is a common approach in modeling of porous media. This as-
sumption enables the combination of the energy equations of the two
phases into a single medium, which reduces the computational cost
(KAVIANY, 1995). External losses due to heat leaks and losses associ-
ated with eddy currents were implemented. The model reproduced the
trends of the experimental data of Tura and Rowe (2011).



38 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

Engelbrecht (2008) developed a transient 1-D model, in which the re-
generator was modeled as a porous medium and the energy equations
for the fluid and solid phases were solved coupled. Engelbrecht (2008)
used a progressive verification of the modeling approach. First, the
model was used to predict the passive regenerator behavior, and was
compared with the Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solution. After,
the model was examined against experimental results and compared
with the Petersen (2007) 2-D model for parallel plates, reproducing
the results for temperature gradients, cooling capacity and COP. The
agreement was better for small plate thickness (&amp;lt;1 mm) because the
1-D model could not directly account for temperature gradients in the
fluid or regenerator.

Petersen (2007), Nielsen (2010) and Oliveira et al. (2012) developed
transient 2-D models for parallel plate AMRs. Nielsen (2010) included
in his model different losses and compared the model against exper-
imental data with good reproducibility of the trends obtained in the
Risoe DTU test device. The model developed by Oliveira et al. (2012)
aimed at studying the transient behavior of the oscillatory fluid flow
and heat transfer in a parallel plate regenerator, in which an analytical
solution was developed for the time-dependent fluid velocity. The en-
ergy equations for the fluid and the solid plates were solved via the finite
volume method. The results showed that for kinetic Reynolds numbers
above 50, a double-peak velocity profile was observed, which resulted
in an intensification of the heat transfer coefficient. However, this limit
corresponded to high operating frequencies, well above the frequencies
encountered in AMR systems. The authors have concluded, there-
fore, that one-dimensional models based on interstitial heat transfer
coefficients are sufficient for predicting the behavior of oscillating-flow
regenerators.

2.9 Design and Optimization of Thermal
Regenerators

In a heat exchanger, there must be good thermal contact between the
fluid and solid phases, but the latter should offer a small resistance to
the fluid flow. These conflicting requirements are often equalized using
thermal optimization.

Thermal regenerator optimization models can be evaluated in terms of



2.9 Design and Optimization of Thermal Regenerators 39

several performance criteria. Among them, second-law based criteria
have been used extensively. A concise review of applications of the
method in the context of heat exchangers and storage systems was
presented by Awad and Muzychka (2012). For passive regenerators,
several optimization procedures were implemented as discussed below.

Krane (1987) evaluated the performance of regenerators using gases as
working fluids and concluded that the storage and removal processes
need to be analyzed together to determine the optimum characteristics
of these devices, which were observed to be quite inefficient (i.e., 70-
90% of the available exergy is destroyed by the end of a cycle). Das
and Sahoo (1991) used the Entropy Generation Minimization (EGM)
method in the thermodynamic optimization of regenerators under sin-
gle blow operation. Their model disregarded the axial heat conduction
and was valid only for low values of NTU. An optimum operating
condition was identified in terms of the cycle time and NTU. In a sub-
sequent work, Das and Sahoo (1999) included the time dependence and
the axial conduction in the EGM analysis, thus extending the validity
of their model to more densely packed regenerators operating at higher
values of NTU.

de Waele et al. (1997) and Steijaert (1999) applied the EGM method to
pulse-tube cryocoolers, taking into consideration the entropy produc-
tion in every component (orifice, heat exchangers, regenerator, switch-
ing valves). The model was used to evaluate the thermodynamic per-
formance of a cryocooler prototype. Based on the work of de Waele
et al. (1997), Nam and Jeong (2006) employed the EGM method in
the analysis of parallel-wire (segmented and unsegmented) mesh re-
generators. They observed a better performance of the unsegmented
parallel-wire configuration (in comparison to a screen mesh matrix) as
a result of lower values of porosity and friction factor. However, axial
heat conduction was identified as the main source of irreversibility in
the parallel-wire case. To overcome this loss, a segmented parallel-wire
geometry was used to decrease the axial conduction irreversibility and
improve the thermodynamic performance of the parallel-wire regener-
ator.

In the context of AMR optimization, EGM analyses were conducted
by Li et al. (2008) and Numazawa et al. (2012). Li et al. (2008) used a
second-law analysis to find optimal regenerator dimensions and spheres
diameters for a real apparatus. They correctly related the limitations
regarding the regenerator housing diameter with the magnet circuit



40 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

size, where to keep the applied magnetic flux density constant and in-
crease the housing diameter, the size of the magnetic circuit has to
increase exponentially. Thus, for a fixed housing diameter, they car-
ried out an optimization of the housing aspect ratio. As a result, Li
et al. (2008) found an optimal coefficient of performance of 15.54 for a
regenerator with an aspect ratio of 6.39 and spheres of 1.1 mm in diam-
eter. However, in the work by Li et al. (2008), the COP was proposed
as the objective function, which did not guarantee a fixed cycle-average
heat transfer rate at the cold source, while the housing aspect ratio and
the sphere size were changed. Numazawa et al. (2012) compared the
performances of packed beds of spheres and parallel plates as regenera-
tive geometries changing geometrical and operating parameters (plate
thickness, sphere diameter, aspect ratio and frequency). However, as
the cooling capacity was not taken as a constraint, it was difficult to
quantify the effect of the geometric and operating parameters. There-
fore, the combination of performance evaluation criteria (PEC) with
the EGM theory to optimize the performance of regenerators is an
original contribution of the present thesis.

In Entropy Generation Minimization methods, the total entropy gen-
eration can be used as the Objective function in an optimization proce-
dure based on constraints, such as the performance evaluation criteria
(PEC) established by Webb and Kim (2005). For a single-phase flow
condition, a thermal device can be optimized according to fixed volume,
fixed face area or variable geometry constraints, which may be useful
in the context of regenerator design for both passive and active appli-
cations. An explanation of the PEC employed in this work is presented
as follows:

? Variable Geometry (VG): this PEC enables varying the regenera-
tor housing cross-section area and length, while keeping the total
housing volume constant. The VG PEC may be useful when
there is freedom in terms of the final aspect ratio of the regener-
ator. For a given mass (volume) of magnetocaloric material, this
PEC can be combined with the design optimization procedure of
the magnet system in order to achieve an optimal configuration
of the AMR device;

? Fixed Face Area (FA): this PEC enables varying the regenerator
housing length, while maintaining the cross-section area constant.
The total mass of solid material is not constant in this PEC, since
it changes with the housing length. In the context of magnetic



2.10 Magnetic Cooling Systems 41

cooling, this PEC can be useful in the optimization of the re-
generator to be fitted in an existing magnet gap. In this case,
the regenerator length can be adjusted to satisfy a specific design
constraint or metric, which generally do not take into account a
performance assessment for the magnet, since its dimensions are
already fixed. Conversely, the FA PEC can also be employed
when neither the size of the magnet gap nor the mass of magne-
tocaloric material are constrained. In this case, both the magnet
and the regenerator can be evaluated together in order to achieve
the optimal applied magnetic flux density volume and the amount
of magnetic raw material that satisfy a specific operating condi-
tion involving, say, the cooling capacity and temperature span;

? Fixed Geometry (FG): in this PEC, both the regenerator housing
cross-section area and its length are kept constant. The FG PEC
may be useful when the dimensions of the regenerator casing (and
hence its total volume) cannot be changed. In a magnetic cooling
apparatus, this is the case when the magnetic circuit is already
designed and built, and there is a predefined volume to place the
regenerator. In this case, only the bed characteristics (e.g., ge-
ometry, particle size) and the flow parameters (e.g., frequency,
flow rate) can be varied. As will be seen later in this thesis, it
is not possible to vary the flow parameters and maintain a fixed
operating condition (cooling capacity and temperature span) while
enforcing the FG PEC in magnetic regenerators.

In order to achieve an optimal set of geometric parameters and oper-
ating conditions that return the minimum entropy generation in the
regenerator, additional constraints must be established. For passive
regenerators, this additional constraint is imposed in terms of a target
regenerator effectiveness, which must be met by the optimal geometry
associated with each PEC. For active magnetic regenerators, the ad-
ditional constraint is a fixed cooling capacity for a given temperature
difference between the thermal reservoirs, which are the actual desired
output of the cooling system.

2.10 Magnetic Cooling Systems

The first near-room-temperature magnetic heat pump was developed
by Brown (1976), in which a temperature span of 47 K was achieved



42 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators

applying Gd as refrigerant and a magnetic flux density of 7 T. However,
only after 1997, with the increasing development of magnetocaloric ma-
terials, the research on magnetic cooling systems became more active.
The magnetic cooling prototypes developed so far are described in re-
view papers (PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 2006; YU et al., 2010)
and books (KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). Kitanovski et al. (2015) pointed
out that approximately 60 prototypes for near-room-temperature re-
frigeration have been developed so far. A thorough description of these
machines is beyond the scope of this thesis. However, as discussed
earlier, in the AMR Brayton cycle the regenerator magnetization and
demagnetization processes are performed in different periods of the cy-
cle. The application and removal of the magnetic field can be performed
in different ways:

? Reciprocating regenerator (Rec-Reg): in this configuration the
regenerator moves back and forth into the stationary magnetic
field. However, as far as the regenerator is concerned, it is still
a stationary bed from the fluid flow point of view (BAHL et al.,
2008);

? Reciprocating magnet (Rec-Mag): in this configuration the re-
generator is stationary and the magnet moves linearly. In gen-
eral, these prototypes operate at low frequencies (&amp;lt;1 Hz) due
to the high inertial forces related to the motion of the magnet
(TREVIZOLI et al., 2011);

? Rotating regenerators (Rot-Reg): in this configuration the re-
generator rotates to magnetize and demagnetize the regenerator
synchronized with the fluid flow. These systems can operate at
higher frequencies but add other complexities like flow distribu-
tion and leakages (ZIMM et al., 2006; ENGELBRECHT et al., 2012).

? Rotating magnet (Rot-Mag): in this configuration the regenera-
tor bed is stationary and the magnet rotates to perform the mag-
netic field variation. This simplifies the flow distribution into and
out of the regenerator beds but the operation at higher frequen-
cies can be a limitation due to high torques. Nevertheless, some
rotating magnets prototypes achieved frequencies of the order of
4 Hz (TURA; ROWE, 2011; LOZANO, 2015).

Table 2.2 presents some characteristics of the main state-of-the-art
magnetic cooling prototypes presented in the literature, whose pho-
tographs are shown in Fig. 2.13.

3 Experimental Apparatus

Experimental analysis is the most straightforward way to evaluate the
heat transfer and viscous losses in passive regenerators. It is also the
simplest way to characterize the performance of active magnetic re-
generators. To accomplish the objectives of the experimental research
described in this thesis, a versatile infrastructure was built to enable
studying passive and active magnetic regenerators in the same appara-
tus. This way, the passive regenerator tests with non-magnetocaloric
materials were performed first, and the active magnetic regenerator
were carried out next, using the same instrumentation and expertise
accumulated with the passive tests. The following characteristics were
pursued in the design of the experimental apparatus:

? Modularity, making it easy to maintain, assemble, disassemble
and change the regenerator matrices;

? Simplicity, facilitating the variation of the operating parameters:
utilization, frequency, heating power (thermal load) and temper-
atures;

? Robustness, particularly with respect to the instrumentation, as
temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, frequency and torque trans-
ducers have been installed to perform a complete characterization;

? Versatility, enabling the application of different types of regener-
ators (passive and active magnetic) and pumping systems, such
as positive displacement pumps and rotary valves.

This chapter presents the design of the experimental apparatus for test-
ing passive and active magnetic regenerators. Next, the characteristics
of the matrices evaluated experimentally will be discussed in detail.



46 3 Experimental Apparatus

3.1 Description

The passive and active magnetic regenerator apparatus is a laboratory
scale set-up, designed to operate at different experimental conditions
with different regenerator geometries and pumping systems. The fol-
lowing are more specific design aspects of the setup:

1. The regenerators are of the fixed-bed type;

2. The oscillatory fluid flow through the fixed bed is imposed by a
double effect pumping system combined with check valves;

3. The change in magnetic flux density on the active magnetic re-
generator is enforced by a magnetic circuit composed by nested
rotating Halbach cylinders that allow operating frequencies up to
1 Hz.

The apparatus is divided in two parts, namely the main section and the
motor section. The two parts are linked by elastic couplings to avoid
vibration in the main section, where the principal components and
instrumentation are located. In the main section, the electrical com-
ponents are located at the lower level, the driving gears and pumping
system are installed at the middle level and the regenerator, magnet,
instrumentation and heat exchangers are placed at the top level. The
motor section comprises the drive motor, secondary pump and torque
meter. Fig. 3.1 presents the main section of the designed apparatus.

3.1.1 Passive Regenerator Apparatus

Fig. 3.2 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental passive regen-
erator apparatus, which is composed of a stationary regenerator bed,
two brazed plate heat exchangers, check valves and a pumping system
consisting of a double effect pump (or displacer), a crank disc and a
stepper motor. Fig. 3.3 shows some images of the passive regenerator
test apparatus.

Depending on the regenerator housing length and type of matrix, there
are five to seven feed-through orifices along the regenerator to
enable positioning of temperature probes in the matrix. The two main
temperature probes (used in all matrix geometries) measure the time-
dependent temperature at the hot and cold ends of the regenerator, THE

and TCE, which are used to calculate the thermal effectiveness of the
regenerator. The remaining temperature probes (used only in sphere
bed regenerators) measure the time-dependent temperature inside the
matrix, Ti1 up to Ti5. These are used to evaluate the temperature
profile along the matrix and provide information about the amplitude
of the temperature change at each position, which are useful in the
evaluation of numerical models.

The temperatures at the hot and cold heat exchangers are controlled
by two independent chillers (ThermoScientific - Neslab, models AC200-
G50 and AC150-A25). The cold end was kept at a constant tempera-
ture, TC, of 280 ± 0.2 K. The hot end was kept at a constant temper-
ature, TH, of 320 ± 0.2 K. The ambient temperature was kept at an
intermediate temperature of 300 ± 2 K to balance the heat gain and
heat loss at the regenerator cold and hot sides, respectively.

50 3 Experimental Apparatus

The pumping system delivers an oscillatory flow to the regenerator,
whereby the flow velocity can be adjusted through the piston stroke
(altering the crank disc position) and the frequency (changing the an-
gular velocity of the motor). Check valves are used to guarantee unidi-
rectional flow in the heat exchangers. The tests were performed using
water as heat transfer fluid. Table 3.1 presents a summary of the con-
ditions of the passive regenerator tests.

The passive regenerator cycle starts with the hot blow, where the dou-
ble effect pump driven by the stepper motor delivers a constant volume
of fluid for a given period. The fluid passes through the mass flow
meter (Hot MFM) and enters the hot heat exchanger where it is re-
conditioned to TH. Then, the fluid exits the hot reservoir and enters
the matrix at 320 K, after passing by the pressure transducer (PH-in).
Inside the regenerator, the end and internal temperatures are read, and
the fluid exits the matrix returning to the pump, passing by the pres-
sure transducer (PC-out). Therefore, the effectiveness of the hot blow is
calculated based on the time-dependent temperature of the fluid exit-
ing the cold end, TCE, and the pressure drop is the difference between
PC-out and PH-in.

In the remaining period of the cycle, the cold blow, the same volume
of fluid is pumped back. The fluid passes through the mass flow meter
(Cold MFM) and enters the cold heat exchanger, where it is recondi-
tioned to TC. Then, the fluid exits the cold reservoir and enters the
matrix at 280 K, after passing by the pressure transducer (PC-in). After
flowing through the regenerator, the fluid exits the matrix returning to
the pump, after flowing by the pressure transducer (PH-out). Hence, the
effectiveness of the cold blow is calculated based on the time-dependent
temperature of the fluid exiting the hot end, THE, and the pressure drop
is the difference between PH-out and PC-in.

3.1.2 Active Magnetic Regenerator Apparatus

Fig. 3.4 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental active mag-
netic regenerator apparatus, which is composed by the same elements
of the passive assembly plus the magnetic circuit and the electrical
heater. The magnetic circuit is made up of two concentric (nested)
Halbach cylinders. This configuration enables changing the applied
magnetic flux density as the cylinders are rotated. The regenerator is
placed in the magnetic gap, i.e., along the centerline of the internal
hollow cylinder. A more detailed description of the magnetic circuit
is presented in the following sections. The 100-mm long, 9.2-? electri-
cal heater was assembled inside a 22.22-mm diameter fiberglass epoxy
(G10) tube. In the AMR apparatus, there were no temperature probes
positioned along the matrix. Fig. 3.5 shows some images of the mag-
netic active regenerator test apparatus.

The temperatures at the hot and cold heat exchangers are controlled
by the same thermal baths used in the passive regenerator apparatus.
The temperatures in both thermal reservoirs can be adjusted according
to the experimental test condition. The fluid pumping system is also
the same. Table 3.2 presents a summary of the experimental conditions
in the AMR tests.

The AMR cycle is divided in two stages, namely the hot period and the
cold period. The hot period starts with the magnetization process and,
as the magnetic flux density in the regenerator changes, the cold blow
is performed. As the fluid enters the matrix at TC, heat is removed
from the regenerator bed and the fluid leaves the regenerator at TH to
reject heat in the hot reservoir. As can be seen in Figs. 3.2 and 3.4, the
apparatus was designed so that there is unidirectional flow through the
hot and cold heat exchangers. This is accomplished by the two check

valves on each side of the apparatus. The cold blow mass flow rate is
measured by the Cold MFM (mass flow meter) and the pressure drop
is taken as the difference between PH-out and PC-in.

During the cold period, the demagnetization process is performed as
the fluid enters the matrix at TH (hot blow), cools down as heat is
transferred to the porous medium, and exits the regenerator at a tem-
perature below TC. The hot blow outlet temperature is represented
by its time-average, T CE. Then, the fluid returns to the double effect
pump and is pumped back to the regenerator through the Cold MFM.
The fluid then flows through the cold heat exchanger and electrical
heater, before returning to the regenerator. Note that in the hot blow
the mass flow rate is measured by the Hot MFM and the pressure drop
is taken as the difference between PC-out and PH-in.

The thermal load is imposed by the electrical heater on the cold side.
The temperature of the fluid entering the heater, THeater-in, is set equal
to the time-average temperature of the fluid that exits the regenerator
at the cold end during the hot blow, T CE. This is accomplished by the
cold heat exchanger, which eliminates any heat gained along tubing and
other elements on the cold side, including the instrumentation. Thus,
there are two temperature probes to measure the heater inlet temper-
ature (or the cold heat exchanger outlet temperature), TCH-out and
THeater-in. The heater outlet temperature, THeater-out, is also measured.
For practical purposes, this is taken as the cold reservoir temperature,
i.e., TC = THeater-out.

The cooling capacity is calculated based on the temperature difference
between the regenerator inlet (cold blow) and outlet (hot blow) tem-
peratures at the cold end, ?TCE = TC ?T CE. A heat balance on the
electrical heater can be used to check this calculation, where the heater
temperature difference is given by ?Theater = TC ? THeater-in. The
cooling capacity calculation procedure will be explained in more detail
in the AMR results chapter, together with some discussions about the
uncertainties associated with the procedure.

3.2.1 Magnetic Circuit

Nested Halbach cylinders (NHC) were used recently in several AMR
apparatuses (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al., 2014). The NHC con-
figuration shown in Fig. 3.6 consists of two concentric Halbach cylin-
ders so that each magnet array generates a magnetic field in its core.
If the magnetic field contributions of each magnet are added, then the
maximum magnetic flux density, ~Bmax, of the NHC is observed at the
core of the inner magnet, as shown in Fig. 3.6(a). Conversely, when
the magnetic field contributions are subtracted, the minimum mag-
netic flux density, ~Bmin, is obtained, as seen in Fig. 3.6(b). Thus, it
follows that the NHC configuration is an alternating magnetic field
source. By creating a relative motion between the cylinders, the mag-
netic field changes continuously between the maximum and the mini-
mum flux density positions (COEY, 2002; BJØRK et al., 2010d; TURA;
ROWE, 2011).

(a) (b)

Figure 3.6 – Nested Halbach cylinders: (a) At the maximum magnetic
field position; (b) At the minimum magnetic field position. The black
arrows indicate the remanent flux density of the permanent magnet
segments, while the red arrows indicate ~B in the magnetic gap.

The NHC configuration was chosen as the magnetic field source for the
present AMR test apparatus for the following reasons:

1. It can generate high magnetic flux densities of the order of 1.5 T;



56 3 Experimental Apparatus

2. It is compact and a reasonable mass of magnetocaloric material
can be contained in the high magnetic field change region;

3. It can be easily assembled with a simple structure;

4. It creates a variable field simply by rotating the cylinders, thus
enabling operating frequencies as high as 4 Hz (TURA; ROWE,
2011).

On the other hand, some drawbacks of NHCs can be listed as follows:

1. Only a single regenerator can be housed per core. Thus, for con-
tinuous cyclic operation, at least two NHCs are required;

2. Oscillating torques can be developed due to segmented magnets
(ARNOLD et al., 2014; MHI?OCHA?IN et al., 1999);

3. Asymmetric magnetic field waveforms can be generated, which
reduce the AMR performance by making the low field period
shorter than the high field (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al.,
2014; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014);

4. A significant amount of permanent magnet raw material
(Nd2Fe14B) is usually required to build NHCs, which leads to
high unit costs.

Typically, NHC arrays have low values of the figure of merit ?cool when
compared with other magnetic circuits (BJØRK et al., 2010c)1. However,
the ability to change the magnetic field at high frequencies with low
inertial effects makes this configuration close to ideal for the present
apparatus design. One of the main challenges of using NHC arrays as
the variable magnetic field source in AMR test devices is the design of
the motion system. Appropriate selection of components, such as gear
boxes, pulleys, belts, driver and shaft couplings is crucial for achieving
frequencies of the order of 1 Hz with low noise and small mechanical
losses.

1?cool can be used to quantify the potential of a magnetic circuit for magnetic
refrigeration applications. An ideal magnet for an AMR prototype, with a high value
of ?cool, should guarantee a large magnetic field variation (high magnetocaloric
effect), a large volume of generated magnetic field (larger density of magnetocaloric
material), must be used during most of the cycle time (ideally in a continuous cycle)
and, equally important, use a small amount of permanent magnet (to reduce cost).



3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 57

Rotating a single magnet or counter rotating the two magnets dictates
how the magnetic field will change in the core of the NHC array, as
illustrated in Fig. 3.7. Rotating the internal magnet (I) with a static
external magnet (E), Fig. 3.7(a), results in the simplest and most com-
pact magnet motion configuration, since the external magnet is usually
the heaviest piece (TURA; ROWE, 2011). As illustrated in Fig. 3.7(a),
rotating the inner array causes both the magnitude (modulus) and the
orientation (direction) of the magnetic flux density vector to change

continuously. At position [(E) at 0?; (I) at 0?], ~B is maximum with a
downward direction, while at position [(E) at 0?; (I) at 45? or 135?],

the modulus of ~B is smaller with the orientation always in phase with
the angle of the inner array. The minimum field is observed at posi-
tion [(E) at 0?; (I) at 180?]. The change in direction of ~B gives rise
to a external magnetic force acting on the magnetocaloric regenerator
positioned in the magnet core. This magnetic force tends to rotate the
regenerator with the magnet, generating structural problems which are
more serious when the regenerator matrix is composed by thin paral-
lel plates or pins. Additionally, a rotating magnetic field direction in
the magnetic gap increases the complexity of evaluating demagnetizing
losses in AMRs (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012).

Counter rotating the internal and external magnets, Fig. 3.7(b), re-
quires a more complex magnet motion system. However, as the Hal-
bach cylinders counter rotate, the modulus of ~B changes continuously,
but the orientation is kept fixed. In Fig. 3.7(b), at position [(E) at 0?;

(I) at 0?], ~B is maximum and points downward, while at position [(E)

at -45?; (I) at 45?], the magnitude of ~B has decreased, maintaining

the same direction. At position [(E) at -90?; (I) at 90?], ~B is mini-

mum. Further counter rotation inverts the direction of ~B. At position
[(E) at -135?; (I) at 135?], the magnitude of ~B is larger, but it points
upward. The maximum modulus is reached again at position [(E) at
-180?; (I) at 180?], this time with an upward direction. For the counter
rotating configuration, the frequency is twice that of the single magnet
configuration.

The design of the NHC array built in this thesis was based on an
analytical method to find the optimal NHC dimensions that guarantee
high magnetic flux densities at the highest possible ?cool. The pro-
posed method was validated with numerical simulations using COM-
SOL Multiphysics 3D and experimental measurements of the magnetic
flux density in the magnet array (TREVIZOLI et al., 2015). The NHC de-

sign and evaluation procedure is summarized in Appendix A. Sintered
Nd2Fe14B (BAKKER-MAGNETICS, 2014) was the magnet raw material
used to manufacture the Halbach cylinders. To avoid the magnetiza-
tion reversal effect (BLOCH et al., 1998; BJØRK et al., 2008), the N50M
and N42UH magnet grades were used in the outer and inner cylinders,
respectively. The final magnetic circuit dimensions are presented in
Table 3.3.

A photograph of the final NHC design built according to the dimen-
sions presented in Table 3.3 is shown in Fig. 3.8. Despite the more

complex bearing structure and motion system, the counter rotating
configuration was preferred since one of the objectives of the AMR test
apparatus is to evaluate experimentally regenerative geometries, such
as parallel plates and staggered arrays of pins. Hence, a fixed direction
of the magnetic flux density vector guarantees structural stability of the
regenerator geometry. Fig. 3.9 presents a y-z cutaway view of the final
magnet design, showing the bearing structure designed for the counter
rotation of the magnets.

flux density along the center line (x = y = 0) of the NHC array (be-
tween z = 0 and 137.5 mm) as a function of the rotating angle of the
internal cylinder. It should be noted that in the counter rotating con-
figuration the two cylinders are dephased by 180?, so the rotating angle
of the external cylinder has a negative sign. The solid lines represent
the measurement stations inside the NHC array where the regenerator
is located (?50 ? z ? 50 mm). The dotted lines correspond to stations
outside the regenerator region surrounded by the bearing structure (see
Fig. 3.9). This means that the NHC array has a maximum magnetic
flux density (at 0 and 180?) of 1.69 T and a minimum flux density (at
90? and 270?) of about 0.04 T.

a small deviation of the ~B direction with respect to the vertical direc-
tion in the region occupied by the regenerator. Outside the cylinder
arrays, the magnetic field decreases continuously to 0 T at z = 137.5
mm and the vector magnetic flux density changes its direction between

simulation results, the radial distribution of the magnetic flux density
is approximately uniform (see Fig. A.2). More information about the

the magnet. Therefore, the proposed design procedure, presented in

tions that require alternating magnetic field changes (TREVIZOLI et al.,

3.2.2 Pumping System

The pumping system of the passive and active magnetic regenerator
apparatus is composed by a double effect pump and a crank disc coupled
with the motor. The double effect pump was chosen as it presents the
following advantages:

1. It can perform the cold and hot blows by simply rotating the
crank disc and using only unidirectional check vales (Fig. 3.13(b));

2. For a given stroke adjusted in the crank disc, the volume of fluid



3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 63

pumped per cycle is fixed. The mass flow rate (and hence the flow
velocity) is adjusted simply by changing the operating frequency.
This allows keeping a constant utilization factor while changing
the mass flow rate (and hence the NTU), as was done to generate
the ideal regenerator results presented in Fig. 2.3;

3. The pumping system is driven directly by the motor, which also
drives the magnetic circuit. Thus, a single motor can be used,
enabling an easier synchronization between the magnetic and fluid
flow cycles. This also simplifies the analysis of the performance
metrics, since the total motor work can be measured directly.

4. It is compact and easy to assemble, service and maintain.

Nevertheless, in terms of performance, the main disadvantage of dou-
ble effect pumps is that they provide sinusoidal fluid flow waveforms,
with a peak in flow velocity in the middle of the blow. As a conse-
quence, peaks in pressure drop and pumping power are also observed.
For instance, if the flow profile is perfectly sinusoidal with an average
pressure drop of 100 kPa (1.0 bar), the peak pressure drop is about 157
kPa (?/2 × 100 kPa), which can offer some restrictions to operating
condition at high mass flow rates. As presented in Fig. 3.13(a) and in
Table 3.4, three different pump sizes were used to cover a broad range
of pumping volumes (and utilization factors). Table 3.4 also shows the
pump dimensions and displaced volume as a function of the stroke that
is adjusted at the crank disc, as presented in Fig. 3.13(c). Finally, the
time-average ( ¯?m) mass flow rate per blow is calculated by:

3.2.3 Transmission System

Fig. 3.14(a) shows the NHC and pumping motion system. A stepper
motor (Kalatec Nema 34, model KML-HT34-487) coupled to a 15:1 re-
duction gearbox is employed to achieve high torques. The stepper mo-
tor is controlled by a driver (Applied Motion model ST10), which guar-
antees precise operating speed and frequency. The torque transducer is
assembled between the reduction and the spiral bevel gearboxes. The
spiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-EA-III, 1:1) was found to be a
suitable and compact solution to counter rotate the magnets, where
the torque imposed by the stepper motor is transmitted by the bevel
gears into two independent shafts that rotate in opposite directions.
Two sets of pulleys and belts are used to connect the spiral bevel gear-
box and the magnets.

66 3 Experimental Apparatus

A second spiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-III, 1:2) was used to
drive the double effect displacer. This gearbox was selected with a
transmission relation of 1:2 to guarantee the phasing with the NHC
since, for counter rotating magnets, the relation between the magnetic
circuit and the motor driving shaft is 2:1. Thus, for a perfect synchro-
nization, the pump also must have a relation of 2:1 with the driving
shaft (two hot and two cold blows). Fig. 3.14(b) shows the transmission
relations between all shafts of the system.

3.2.4 Magnetic and Fluid Flow Synchronization

Fig. 3.15 presents the magnetic and fluid flow waveforms of the AMR
apparatus. The hot cycle takes place between 0 and 180o, during which
the magnetic flux density increases from approximately 70% of its max-
imum at zero flow to 100% at a maximum flow velocity at 90o. Then,
the magnetic flux density decreases to approximately 70% again and the
flow reverses. In the remaining period, i.e., the cold cycle, the magnetic
flux density reaches a minimum when the hot blow velocity reaches a
maximum in the reverse direction. It is worth noting that the magnetic
flux density waveform is a rectified sinusoidal profile, with a sharp min-
imum at around 270o. As shown in Trevizoli et al. (2013a, 2014), this
results in a very short period of time at the minimum magnetic flux den-
sity, which has a negative impact on the performance of the magnetic
cycle in comparison with the perfect sinusoidal and square waveforms.

3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices

The passive regenerators matrices were built using different bed geome-
tries to enable a comprehensive performance evaluation (e.g., losses)
and model validation. The following matrix geometries were evalu-
ated: packed beds of spheres, pin arrays and parallel plates. The
resulting variety of geometric parameters, from porous media length
scales to housing dimensions, are important to verify the sensitivity
and generality of the experimental and numerical results. Addition-
ally, the comparisons between different porous media matrices enabled
analyzing the potential of each geometry in terms of their thermal per-
formances and associated losses. All matrices used in the passive heat
transfer analysis in this thesis were made from stainless steel AISI-304.

Figure 3.15 – Magnetic and fluid flow waveforms synchronization.

In the sphere packed bed regenerators, three different spherical par-
ticles and four different regenerator housing (casing) geometries were
used. As will be seen, three casings have the same cross sectional area,
Ac,Reg, and different lengths, LReg, while two share the same length but
have different cross sectional areas. The porosity, ?, was approximately
constant in all matrices. This allows a more precise performance com-
parison for different values of flow rate, superficial velocity and utiliza-
tion, which is crucial for evaluating the sensitivity of the experimental
apparatus, validating the numerical model and optimizing performance
for a specified operating condition.

The void volume is another important parameter for evaluating the per-
formance of regenerative matrices, especially when the total volume of
the matrix is varied. As mentioned before, the void volume is defined as
the volume of fluid between each regenerator end and its corresponding
heat exchanger that changes direction outside the regenerator, without
interacting thermally with it. The void volume fraction, ??, is defined
as the ratio between the total void volume, ?, and the fluid volume in



68 3 Experimental Apparatus

the regenerator, ?Ac,RegLReg:

?? =
?

?Ac,RegLReg
(3.2)

To study the impact of the void volume on the thermal performance
of passive regenerators, different regenerator-to-tube adapters (R-T
adapters) were designed and fabricated with different void volume sizes,
which can be combined with the different housing volumes to result in
different values of ?? for each case. The void volume size is approxi-
mately the internal volume of the R-T adapters.

Regarding the different bed geometries, the spheres, pins and plates
were selected and/or fabricated to maintain approximately the same
particle diameter. In porous media, the particle diameter is the ratio
of the surface (interstitial heat transfer) area and the volume of the
regenerator. Thus, for bed geometries with the same particle diameter
and approximately the same porosity, the heat transfer surface area
is approximately the same. As a result, by fixing the mass flow rate
(constant utilization and frequency), housing cross sectional area and
void volume fraction, what differentiates the surfaces with respect to
their thermal performance are the magnitude of the interstitial heat
transfer coefficient and the thermal losses, especially the axial heat
conduction (since in passive regenerators the heat exchange with the
ambient is negligible).

3.3.1 Packed Beds of Spheres

The packed bed matrices were composed by stainless steel spheres with
particle diameters, dp, of 0.5 mm, 0.8 mm and 1 mm, as shown in
Fig. 3.16. The regenerator casings are presented in Fig. 3.17. Cas-
ings #1, #2 and #3 have the same cross sectional area but different
lengths. Casings #3 and #4 have the same length but different cross
sectional areas. Table 3.5 presents the dimensions and porosities as-
sociated with each matrix, where Dh,Reg is the regenerator housing
hydraulic diameter and ?Reg = LReg/Dh,Reg is the regenerator aspect
ratio. The housing for the packed bed regenerators were made from
acetal resin (POM). The R-T adapter #1 was used in the tests pre-
sented in this section for Casings #1, #2 and #3. For Casing #4
a specific R-T adapter was designed because of the smaller diameter



3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 69

of this casing, as presented in Table 3.5. The different void volume
fractions are also presented in Table 3.5.

The dimensional measurement uncertainties associated with the diam-
eters and lengths were taken as the design tolerances used to machine
the casings. The porosity was calculated using the casing volume and
the total mass of the spheres, whose uncertainties involve the dimen-
sional tolerance and the scale uncertainty. The maximum calculated
uncertainty of the porosity was about ± 0.005. More details about the
packed bed regenerator assembly can be found in Appendix B.

3.3.2 Void Volume and Entrance Effects

In the evaluation of the effect of the regenerator aspect ratio, it is
important to maintain a fixed void volume fraction. Thus, different R-
T adapters were fabricated in order to achieve a void volume fraction
of about 7.5% in the regenerators with the same diameter and different
lengths, as presented in the secondary diagonal of Table 3.6 and in
Fig. 3.18.

In theory, eliminating the void volumes improves the regenerator ther-
mal performance, as these are directly related to the leakage losses
(SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). In order to systematically evaluate the impact
of the void volumes on the performance of the passive regenerators de-
veloped here, the void volumes were decreased by reducing the diverg-
ing section of the R-T adapters. However, this reduction of the cross
sectional area is known to increase the importance of two-dimensional
flow entrance effects (i.e., mixing) inside the regenerator matrix, which
can impact negatively on the regenerator effectiveness. Therefore, for
a fixed regenerator geometry, changing the R-T adapter enables quan-
tifying the balance between the impact of the void volume and the
entrance effects on the thermal performance. Additionally, a zero void
volume regenerator (Casing #7) was built based on the AMR geometry
proposed by Lozano (2015). The zero void volume housing of Lozano
(2015), presented in Fig. 3.19, had a round rectangular cross sectional
area, with the flow streams entering and exiting the regenerator by the
parallel ports on each side, flowing diagonally through the matrix. The

regenerator dimensions for Casing #7 are shown in Table 3.7, where
WReg and HReg are the cross-section width and height, respectively.
Two different spheres sizes were evaluated in this regenerator, namely
0.5 and 1 mm.

3.3.3 Parallel Plates and Pin Arrays

The parallel plate and staggered square pin array regenerators were
machined by wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM). The me-
chanical design of the matrices took into account limitations such as
the minimum wire diameter (0.14 mm) and maximum wire length (25
mm) (EDM-TECHNOLOGIES, 2013). A 1-mm thick base plate was used
in the present design to guarantee the structural stability of the matrix.

Based on the above fabrication limitations and to guarantee an inter-
stitial area equivalent to that of the 0.8-mm packed sphere regenerator,
the pins and plates were designed to yield equivalent particle diameters
and porosities of around 0.8 mm and 36%, respectively. This resulted
in plates with a thickness of 0.25 mm and square pins with 0.53-mm



3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 73

sides. Fig. 3.20 shows single pieces of a WEDM parallel plate and a
square pin array matrix. For simplicity, the pin array and plate ma-
trices have a square cross sectional area, while the cross section areas
of the packed sphere matrices are round. The final regenerators were
designed to have approximately the same cross sectional area and the
same total matrix mass/volume. Therefore, given values of fluid flow
rate and frequency will result in approximately the same utilization
factor and fluid superficial velocity. Consequently, any differences in
NTU or performance between the matrices can be regarded as due to
differences in heat transfer coefficient and thermal losses. Table 3.8
shows the geometric characteristics of the matrices, where eg denotes
the thickness of the solid piece (plate or pin) and ech is the thickness
of the flow channel or passage.

To build the 100-mm long pin and plate regenerators, as presented in
Fig. 3.21, five 20-mm long pieces were combined into a single regener-
ator matrix. The challenge in this assembly was to avoid obstructing
the flow passages, as shown in Fig. 3.21(a). Next, the final matrix was
inserted in a 3D-printed digital ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)
housing, shown in Figs. 3.21(b) and (c). The matrices were kept fixed
to the housing by epoxy resin to avoid flow channeling. Finally, the
ABS housing was inserted into a G10 fiberglass resin casing to improve
the mechanical resistance, as shown in Fig. 3.21(d). The mounting of
the ABS piece into the G10 casing was designed with a tight tolerance
to prevent external leakages. More details regarding the pin array and
plate regenerators are presented in Appendix B.

New R-T adapters with a square sectional area were designed to mini-
mize flow maldistributions in the parallel plate and pin array matrices.
The void volume sizes of these adapters are the same as those made
for Casing #4 (packed spheres). The square R-T adapters, shown in
Fig. 3.22, were also 3D printed in digital ABS.

3.4 AMR Matrices

The AMR matrices were also built in the three different porous media
geometries, i.e., packed beds of spheres, parallel plates and pin arrays.
Also, as will be seen, the regenerator housing dimensions were kept
constant. All the AMR matrices were made from commercial-grade
gadolinium (Gd).

The first AMR matrix assembled and evaluated in this thesis (for this
reason referred to as the Reference AMR) consists of a packed bed
of Gd spheres with diameters in the range 0.5 ? dp ? 0.6 mm (0.55
mm average). The dimensions of the Reference AMR casing are 22.22
mm (ID of the G10 casing) and 100 mm (casing length), which are

the maximum housing dimensions that fit in the magnetic gap of the
Halbach array.

Other AMR regenerators were built with the same dimensions of the
passive regenerator matrices shown in Table 3.8. The housings and
R-T adapters were also identical in their geometry and materials. The
only slight difference between the passive and active regenerators lies
in the sphere diameter range of the Gd packed bed regenerator. The
Gd spheres were supplied with diameters in the range 0.71 ? dp ? 0.85
mm (0.78 mm average). Therefore, by evaluating the performances of
the passive regenerators in the light of their thermal effectiveness, axial
heat conduction and viscous losses, it will be possible to draw some
conclusions about these losses in the AMR geometries and understand
the impact of losses occurring only in active regenerators, i.e., the mag-
netic losses. Table 3.9 shows the geometric characteristics of the AMR
regenerators.

3.5 Thermal Insulation

Thermal insulation is a crucial aspect in regenerator design. The heat
interactions between the regenerator and the surroundings have to be
carefully considered when comparing experimental data and numerical
results. A trustworthy comparison between numerical and experimental
regenerator results can be performed in only two ways: (i) by making a
good thermal insulation; (ii) by implementing a comprehensive model
for the heat transfer with the surroundings.

In the passive regenerator experiments, the POM casings were designed
with a minimum wall thickness of 11 mm. Additionally, there is enough
space around the regenerator housing to put the thermal insulation, as
can be seen in Fig. 3.23, where the red arrows indicate the steps of
the insulation procedure. The ambient temperature was kept at 300



3.5 Thermal Insulation 77

K during all experiments, as this is the average temperature between
the reservoirs (i.e., 280 K at the cold and 320 K at the hot heat ex-
changers, respectively). All passive regenerator experimental tests were
conducted at this condition so as to compensate the heat gained from
and lost to the surroundings.

Figure 3.23 – Steps of the application of the thermal insulation on the
passive regenerators.



78 3 Experimental Apparatus

On the other hand, in the AMR regenerators there is not sufficient space
to put a good thermal insulation around the regenerator. Thus, there
is a trade-off between how big the housing thickness can be and the
total mass of magnetocaloric material to be placed in the regenerator.
However, a thermal insulation as effective as the one used in the passive
experiments is not possible. Fig. 3.24 shows cross-section views of the
two types of AMRs inside the magnet gap. In Fig. 3.24(a), the Spheres
#3 regenerator, the thermal insulation is performed only by the G10
casing. Conversely, in the parallel plate and pin array regenerators
shown in Fig. 3.24(b) (Plates #5 and Pins #6), the thermal insulation
is executed by the ABS and G10 layers. It should be noted that in the
Spheres #4 geometry, the insulation is similar to that in the plate and
pin array regenerators. The air gap between the regenerator casing
and the inner magnet is 0.8-mm thick. Besides, the magnet has a
much bigger thermal mass compared with that of the regenerator, thus,
the heat transfer interaction between the regenerator and the magnet
cannot be disregarded. As will be seen, special attention has been given
to the modeling of the heat transfer to the casing and surroundings in
the present thesis.

3.6 Instrumentation and Data Acquisition 79

3.6 Instrumentation and Data Acquisition

For an in-depth characterization of the thermal passive and active mag-
netic regenerator performances, different transducers were applied, as
presented in Table 3.10. The instrumentation was positioned at dif-
ferent points of the experimental setup, as shown in Figs. 3.2 and 3.4
for the passive and AMR apparatuses, respectively. The readings were
performed with a National Instruments data acquisition (DAQ) sys-
tem connected to a computer equipped with Labview 2009. The time-
dependent variables were measured, graphically evaluated and saved
in data files for a subsequent data regression. Additional information
about the main components of the DAQ are presented in Table 3.11.

Grounded 0.5-mm diameter temperature probes (T-type thermocou-
ples) were selected for the transient temperature measurements, due to
their low inertia. The probes were calibrated using a standard ther-
mometer with an uncertainty of 0.1 K. The probes and the standard
thermometer were positioned in a thermal bath with a variable temper-
ature between 263 and 333 K (intervals of 5 K). For every temperature,
after stabilization, the readings were averaged over 2 minutes. The cal-
culated uncertainty of the probes positioned at the regenerator ends,
inside the matrix and the probes used to calculate the heater enthalpy

flux was 0.15 K. The uncertainty of the ambient temperature probes
was 0.2 K.

The pressure transducers were calibrated using a DH Bundenberg 580-
series dead-weight tester between 100 kPa and 1000 kPa. According to
the calibration report, the maximum uncertainty of the pressure trans-
ducers was 0.5 kPa. The scale was calibrated using standard weights
between 50 and 500 g, and the uncertainty was evaluated at 0.02 g.

The uncertainties of the remaining instruments were obtained from
their respective catalog information. Two different torque meters were
used, depending on the torque being measured. To measure the indi-
vidual torques developed by the pumping system the low range trans-
ducer was applied due to the smaller uncertainties involved. However,to
measure the total torque developed by the AMR (including pumping
system and magnetic circuit), which can be as high as 30 Nm, a 50
Nm (full scale) torque meter was used. Coriolis mass flow meters were
selected for their capability of reading pulsating flows with a relatively
low uncertainty. The time constant of the present Coriolis flow meters
was such that they were capable of reading flow rate transients at low
frequencies (between 0.25 and 0.5 Hz). Average mass flow rates for fre-
quencies between 0.75 and 2 Hz still can be measured with reasonable
accuracy (to be discussed later). Nevertheless, due to the large time
constant, the average mass flow can be slightly overestimated up to 15
kg/h for high mass flow rates (&gt; 100 kg/h).

A linear potentiometer is positioned in phase with the double effect
pump (see Figs. 3.13(a) and 3.14) and is used mainly to calculate the
operating frequency to be used in the data regression. Based on the
time-dependent potentiometer signal, the Labview Tone Measurement
tool reads the sinusoidal waveform and converts it into a frequency
value. An excellent correlation was verified between the stepper motor
and the potentiometer frequency signal. Also, based on the poten-
tiometer signal, it was possible to identify the points where the hot
and cold blows start and end. This is the first step in the evaluation
of the performance metrics, where no phasing is verified between the
potentiometer and temperature probes, but a small phasing, less than
3% of the blow period, is corrected in the pressure transducers and
torque meter readings. Only the mass flow meters presented a more
noticeable phasing that can be attributed to the time constant.

For a precise time-average analysis, the data acquisition rate, fDAQ,
was selected according to the operating frequency as follows:

= 300 (3.3)

which means that, irrespective of the frequency, there are 150 data
points in the cold and hot cycles, respectively.

3.7 Details of the Final Assembly

The calibration and positioning of the temperature probes are ex-
tremely important in the present experimental analysis, since the ther-
mal effectiveness and temperature control of the cold end in AMR tests
are based on the time-average temperatures at the ends of the regener-
ators. Fig. 3.25(a) presents the final assembly of Casing #3, where the
internal and end temperature probes can be identified in Figs. 3.25(b)
and (c). It should be noted that Casings #1, #2 and #4 are similar,
but Casing #1 has 3 internal probes, Casing #2 has 4 internal probes
and Casing #3 and #4 have 5 internal probes.

Fig. 3.26(a) shows a picture of the parallel plate (Plates #5) regenerator
(identical to Pins #6), with the instrumentation at the regenerator
ends. Fig. 3.26(b) shows an end temperature probe in detail. No
internal probes were used in the plate and pin array geometries.

Fig. 3.27(a) shows a picture of Casing #7, with the instrumentation
positioned at the regenerator ends. Fig. 3.27(b) shows the end tem-
perature probes. For Casing #7, no internal temperature probes were
used. As Casing #7 was designed and fabricated without void volumes,
two different temperature probes were used on each side; one for the
inlet and another for the outlet flow measurements. All other matrices
used single probes positioned in the void volume at each regenerator
end, allowing measurements of temperatures of the inlet and outlet
streams.

Regarding the AMR regenerators, all matrices had the same length
and no internal temperature probes were used. Fig. 3.28(a) shows the
final AMR assembly, where the regenerator region is at the middle
part. The AMR length is 100 mm and, as presented in Fig. 3.9, the
magnetic circuit is 275 mm in length. To increase the final housing
length, the AMR is assembled between two G10 tube adapters. The
G10 tube adapters are fitted to centering bearing housings, shown in
Fig. 3.28(c), that are positioned at the ends of the magnetic circuit
to guarantee the concentricity between the regenerator housing and
the magnet cylinders. Since there is little room available around the
matrix, the temperature probe is assembled axially and bent to ensure
cross flow around the probe, as shown in Fig. 3.28(b).

Four transducers were used to measure the flow static pressure: two
for the hot blow (indicated by the red arrows) and two for the cold
blow (blue arrows), as presented in Fig. 3.29. This configuration was
preferred to avoid oscillating flow on the pressure transducers, which
simplifies the calculation of the time-average pressure drop, especially
in terms of phasing between the temperature and pressure readings.

setup, showing in detail the position of the temperature probes and

4 Problem Formulation
and Solution Method

This chapter describes the numerical model developed to study passive
and active magnetic regenerators. The fluid flow and heat transfer in
the porous medium are modeled using a one-dimensional, transient,
thermal non-equilibrium approach. Besides the magnetic field depen-
dent physical properties, the main difference between the passive and
AMR thermal models lies in the presence of a source term in the solid
energy equation, which is responsible for the magnetocaloric effect.

4.1 Regenerative Porous Matrix Modeling

The regenerator matrix is treated as a porous medium, with a void
volume fraction (porosity), ?, occupied by the fluid phase. The solid
phase fraction is 1??. Thermal non-equilibrium is assumed between the
phases, which have different temperatures (KAVIANY, 1995). A volume-
average approach (QUINTARD; WHITAKER, 1993; KAVIANY, 1995) was
adopted to avoid the computational costs involved in solving the trans-
fer processes at the pore scale level. In the one-dimensional formulation,
the heat transfer between the phases is modeled in terms of an inter-
stitial heat transfer coefficient, evaluated based on correlations for the
Nusselt number.

The passive regenerator model comprises the momentum equation,
which is used to calculate the fluid flow through the porous matrix
and conjugate energy equations for the fluid and solid phases. To ex-
tend this heat transfer model to the AMR case, a magnetic model is
incorporated into the heat transfer calculation loop to compute the



88 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and the demagnetization losses.

The mathematical model of the fluid flow and heat transfer in a re-
generative porous matrix is described next. The basic geometry of the
model is presented in Fig. 4.1. The following simplifying assumptions
were made:

1. One dimensional flow;

2. Laminar, incompressible fluid flow;

3. Low porosity medium, i.e., ? &amp;lt;0.6;

4. Absence of body forces.

Figure 4.1 – Basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer
model of a regenerative porous matrix.

In the porous medium heat transfer model, initially, the thermal losses
to the surroundings and the void volumes on each end of the matrix
adjacent to the thermal reservoirs are disregarded. The fluid enters the
regenerator at constant and uniform temperatures, i.e., TCE = TC at
the cold end and THE = TH at the hot end, where TC and TH are the
temperatures of the cold and hot thermal reservoirs, respectively.

4.1.1 Momentum Equation

The macroscopic momentum equation, also known as Brinkman-Forch-
heimer equation, is given by (KAVIANY, 1995; NIELD; BEJAN, 2006):

(Darcy term) and microscopic inertial force (Ergun inertial term), re-
spectively. In the fluid flow model, the fluid properties were treated as
constants obtained at an average fluid temperature. The solutions of
the flow and temperature fields are, therefore, uncoupled. This sim-
plifies the model and reduces significantly the convergence time, since
it is not necessary to solve the pressure-velocity coupling to guarantee
the mass conservation. Using the simplifying assumptions (2), (3) and

where t is the time, u is the superficial (Darcian) flow velocity, ? is the

of the porous media and cE is the Ergun constant, which depend on
the geometry and porosity of the matrix and are evaluated based on a
closure relationships that will be presented Section 4.3.

The non-dimensionalization of Eq. (4.2) is explained next. The di-
mensionless time is defined as t? = ?t, where ? = 2?f is the angular
frequency and f the cycle frequency. To describe the oscillatory flow in
the regenerator, the pressure gradient can be approximated by a time-
dependent function, which contains a characteristic waveform (ZHAO;
CHENG, 1996, 1998; OLIVEIRA et al., 2012):

where At is the amplitude of the pressure drop waveform and g(t

the dimensionless mathematical function that describes the waveform.
In the present thesis, since the fluid flow is generated by a double effect



90 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

displacer coupled to a rotating crank disc, the fluid flow has a sinusoidal
waveform, hence g(t?) = sin(?t). Thus, in Eq. (4.2), the dimensionless

pressure gradient can be approximated directly by ??P
?z

???? = g(t?).
The dimensionless velocity in the momentum equation is defined as
u?D = u/uD,max, where uD,max is the maximum velocity calculated via
the Darcy Equation, i.e., when the dimensionless pressure gradient is
constant and maximum, g(t?) = 1. As a result:

Therefore, when terms other than the microscopic shear stress are non-
negligible, the actual maximum velocity in the porous medium, umax,
is different from uD,max, which means that the value of u

is, in general, less than unity. In geometries such as parallel plates, the
shear stress is small and, as a result, uD,max = umax. The dimensionless

4.1.2 Energy Equations

The derivation of the energy equations for the fluid and solid phases
considers the one-dimensional, laminar, incompressible fluid flow in the
porous medium. The thermophysical properties of both phases depend
on the temperature and, in the active magnetic regenerator case, the
properties of the magnetocaloric material also depend on the magnetic
flux density. Again, it is important to note that the momentum equa-
tion and the energy equations are solved uncoupled. Hence, the flow
velocity is an input parameter in the energy solver.

where the dimensionless fluid and solid temperatures are given by

mensionless superficial velocity is defined as u? = u/umax, where umax
is the maximum instantaneous velocity in the oscillatory flow field al-
ready known from the momentum solution. z? = z/LReg is the di-
mensionless axial distance, and LReg is the length of the regenerator
bed. The aspect ratio based on the hydraulic diameter of the porous
medium is defined as ? = LReg/dh. Finally, ?f = kf(T)/(?f(T)cp,f(T))
is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid.

The dimensionless numbers in Eq. (4.7) are the Nusselt number based
on the hydraulic diameter Nudh = h(z)dh/kf(T), the Fourier number

variables ?efff , D|| and Nudh depend on the geometry of the porous me-
dia and are calculated using specific closure relationships that will be
presented in Section 4.3. The dimensionless casing heat transfer term,
q??csg, is defined in Section 4.2.2

The dependence of the fluid properties, namely ?, cp, k and µ, on the
temperature was considered by means of interpolations from the EES
(Engineering Equation Solver) database (KLEIN, 2013). In the passive
regenerator modeling, the properties were those of distilled water, while
in the AMR modeling the fluid was a mixture of distilled water and
ethylene-glycol (80%/20% wt.).

where the term on the left accounts for thermal inertia in the solid,

respectively. ?s is the solid density, cs is the solid specific heat capacity
and keffs is the effective thermal conductivity of the solid (KAVIANY,
1995; NIELD; BEJAN, 2006).

Using the same dimensionless variables of the fluid energy equation,

thermal diffusivity of the solid, `c = (1 ? ?)/? is the characteristic
length of the porous medium and&amp;lt;? = ?f(T)cpf(T)/?s(T)cs(T) is the

thermal capacity ratio. The effective thermal conductivity of the solid,
?effs , depends on the geometry of the porous medium and is calculated
using an appropriate closure relationship to be described in Section 4.3.
The Biot number can be calculated based on the Nusselt number, Bi
= (`c/dh)(kf(T)/ks(T))Nu. The dimensionless magnetocaloric term,
q??MCE, is defined in Section 4.4.1.

The dependence of the solid properties of the passive matrix, namely
?, c and k, on the temperature were calculated via interpolations of
the properties of stainless steel available in EES (KLEIN, 2013). In the
modeling of active regenerators, the properties of Gd were estimated
using a specific calculation procedure to be described in Section 4.4.3.

4.2 Losses Modeling

The modeling of different types of losses is necessary for a more precise
comparison with the experimental data, which leads to more consistent
evaluations of the physical phenomena involving heat transfer and fluid
flow. Regarding the void volume losses, Jacobs and Zimm (2008) pre-
sented numerical results that showed a significant impact of the void
volume size on the AMR cooling capacity. According to Nielsen et
al. (2011), the heat interactions between the regenerator bed and its
surroundings are disregarded in most AMR models, which assume a
perfect insulation of the bed and ignore the thermal interactions with
the regenerator housing. Thus, the present numerical model introduces
a comprehensive modeling of thermal and void volume losses in order
to better evaluate their impact on the thermal performance of passive
and active magnetic regenerators.

4.2.1 Void Volume Modeling

The void volume modeling consists in evaluating the time-dependent
temperature of the fluid in the space between each regenerator end and
the adjacent heat exchanger. At the end of a given blow, a volume
of fluid stops in the void volume and returns to the regenerator bed
in the next blow. This fluid does not interact with the thermal reser-
voirs. Moreover, the fluid that returns to the regenerator does so at
a temperature that is actually time dependent. The temperatures of
the fluid entering the regenerator at the cold and hot ends (during the



94 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

cold and hot blows, respectively), coming from the void volumes, are
termed here T vvf (t)|CE and T

vv
f (t)|HE. These temperatures are calcu-

lated based on a solution of the energy equation for the cold and hot
void volumes. Fig. 4.2 shows the basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow
and heat transfer model including the void volumes, which are modeled
as an extension of the regenerator bed without the porous medium.

Figure 4.2 – Basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer
model including the void volumes.

The assumptions made in the derivation of the energy equation for the
void volumes are as follows:

1. One dimensional, laminar and incompressible flow;

2. The void volumes have the same cross sectional area as the re-
generator bed. Hence, the flow velocity in the void volumes is the
same as the superficial velocity in the regenerator;

3. The heat transfer with the walls is negligible;

4. The hot and cold void volumes are identical;

5. The fluid properties depend only on the temperature.

The void volume length, Lvv, is calculated based on the void volume
fraction, ??, defined in Eq. (3.2), where the size of the void volume is
defined as ? = Ac,RegLvv. Therefore:

Lvv = ??
?Lreg (4.10)

After the assumptions, the energy equation for the fluid in the void
volume is given by:

? = z/Lvv
and ?vv = LReg/Dh,Reg. The other dimensionless variables have been
defined as before.

4.2.2 Casing Heat Transfer Modeling

The casing heat transfer modeling consists in determining the heat
transfer rate per unit volume through the regenerator casing wall, q?csg.
This loss is more significant in the AMR simulation, because the ther-
mal insulation around the passive regenerator is more effective. In the
AMR experiments, there is little room for a good thermal insulation
and, as a result, the heat gained from the external environment can
deteriorate the performance of the AMR. Thus, q?csg has been included
as a source term in the fluid energy equation (Eq. (4.6)).

Fig. 4.3 shows the basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer
model including the void volumes and the adjacent domains. In addi-
tion to the casing wall and air gap (thicknesses ewall and eair, respec-
tively), the magnetic circuit is also considered in the heat interactions.

The following assumptions are considered in the casing heat transfer
modeling:

1. The heat transfer in the wall and air gap is two-dimensional, i.e.,
both the radial and longitudinal directions are considered;

2. The curvature of the regenerator wall is negligible so that a carte-
sian coordinate system can be used to describe the problem ge-
ometry;

3. The air properties depend only on the temperature;

4. The wall properties are constant but, depending on the wall ma-
terial, the transversal (i.e., radial) and longitudinal thermal con-
ductivities can be different. Thus, specifically for the G10 casing
kwall,y 6= kwall,z.

5. Since the thermal mass of the magnetic circuit is very large, the
temperature of the magnet is assumed constant.

To calculate q?csg, the energy balances in the air gap and regenerator
wall need to be evaluated. The energy equation for the air layer is given

In cases where the regenerator housing is composed by two different
materials, such as in the parallel plates and pin arrays regenerators,
Eq. (4.15) is solved for both layers of the casing. After solving the
energy equations for the air gap and regenerator wall, q?csg is calculated
by:

q?csg = ?hwall

Ac,Reg

(Tf ?Twall|(y=0)) (4.16)

where Pc,Reg is the internal perimeter of the regenerator section and
hwall is the internal wall heat transfer coefficient (to be defined in Sec-
tion 4.3.6). In dimensionless form, the energy equations for the air gap
and regenerator wall are given by:

important to notice that Eqs. (4.7), (4.17), (4.18) and (4.16) are solved
coupled in the energy equation loop. The boundary conditions will be
explained in detail in Section 4.5.

Additionally, the dimensionless q?csg to include in the dimensionless form
of the fluid phase energy equation (Eq. (4.7)) is given by:

4.3 Closure Relationships

4.3.1 Particle Diameter and Surface Area Density

Before presenting the closure relationships, it is important to define
the equivalent particle diameter, dp, and the surface area density, ?,
of the porous medium. The surface area density is defined as the ratio
of the interstitial area, AHT, to the overall matrix volume, Vs/(1 ??),
where Vs is the volume of solid material in the matrix. Thus (KAVIANY,
1995):

? = (1 ??)Sv (4.20)

where Sv = AHT/Vs is the specific surface area, i.e., the interstitial
area per unit solid volume. The equivalent particle diameter, in turn,
is given by:

dp =
6

Sv
(4.21)

The geometry of the porous beds investigated in this thesis (i.e., packed
bed of monodisperse spheres, parallel plates and square pin arrays) are
simple enough so that the relationships that define their Sv and dp are
straightforward. Therefore, for each different matrix geometry, one has
(KAVIANY, 1995):

Sv =
6

dsph
; dp = dsph (for bed of spheres) (4.22)

Sv =
4

epin
; dp =

3

2
epin (for pin arrays) (4.23)

Sv ?
2

ePP
; dp = 3ePP (for parallel plates) (4.24)

where dsph is the spherical particle diameter, epin is the square pin side
length and ePP is the parallel plate thickness.



4.3 Closure Relationships 99

4.3.2 Permeability and Ergun Constant

The momentum equation requires closure relationships for the porous
medium permeability and Ergun constant. The permeability, K, can
be written in the following form:

K =
?

16kk
d2h (4.25)

where kk is the Kozeny constant and dh is related to the particle diam-
eter by:

dh =
2

3

?

1 ??
dp (4.26)

For parallel plates, the Kozeny constant can be determined from a solu-
tion of the Navier-Stokes equation for fully developed flow (KAVIANY,
1995). For packed spheres, the value suggested by Ergun (1952) was
used, where 16kk = 150. For pin arrays, there are several available
correlations for the permeability (KAVIANY, 1995; NAKAYAMA; KUWA-
HARA, 2005; YAZDCHI et al., 2011). However, none of them were found
appropriate for the pin array geometry studied in the present work.
Thus, kk was calculated based on the tortuosity, ?, of the porous me-
dium, as suggested by Kaviany (1995), p. 33, where kk = ko?

2. As-
suming ko = 2.5 and ? = Le/L = 2

1/2, where Le = 2
1/2L, results in

kk = 5. Therefore:

kk = 9.375 (for packed beds of spheres (ERGUN, 1952))

kk = 5 (for pin arrays)

kk = 2 (for parallel plates (KAVIANY, 1995))

The Ergun constant, cE, can be generically written as follows:

cE =
a

(16kk?3)1/2
(4.27)



100 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

where a is a constant proportional to the Ergun inertial term in the
momentum equation. Hence, a is larger in geometries where the accel-
eration term is more important:

a = 1.75 (for packed beds of spheres (ERGUN, 1952))

a = 2/3 (for pin arrays)

a = 0 (for parallel plates)

It is well known that for parallel plates the flow acceleration is nil. For
packed beds of spheres, the value of a proposed by Ergun (1952) has
been adopted. Finally, for pin arrays, the acceleration effect of the
fluid is smaller when compared with the the bed of spheres. In the
literature, there are different approaches to the modeling of cE for pin
arrays (KAVIANY, 1995; NAKAYAMA; KUWAHARA, 2005; NIELD; BEJAN,
2006; TERUEL; RIZWAN-UDDIN, 2009; TAMAYOL et al., 2010). However,
none of them reproduced well the present pin array porous media, due
to different dimensions and ranges of operating conditions. Thus, the
general procedure suggested on p. 67 of Kaviany (1995) was adopted
here, which resulted in the constant a being equal to 2/3.

4.3.3 Interstitial Heat Transfer Coefficient

The interstitial heat transfer coefficient, h, was calculated using Nusselt
number correlations written in terms of an appropriate characteristic
length. For parallel plates, the correlation of Nickolay and Martin
(2002) was used because it accounts for entrance effects on the paral-
lel plate geometry, resulting in a Nusselt number, Nudh(z), that is a
function of the longitudinal position, 0 ? z ? LReg:

Nudh(z) =
h(z)dh

where Nu = (Nun1 + Nu

1/n, Nu1 = 7.541, Nu2 = 1.841[Gz(z)]
1/3

and n = 3, 592. The Graetz number is defined as Gz(z) = (dh/z)Pe and



4.3 Closure Relationships 101

Pe = dh(u/?)/?f. The hydraulic diameter in the parallel plate geome-
try is twice the channel thickness.

The interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient for packed bed of
spheres and pin arrays was calculated using the particle diameter-based
Nusselt number correlation proposed by (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010):

Nudp =

where Redp is the Reynolds number based on the particle diameter.
This correlation was preferred instead of more traditional ones for beds
of spheres (WAKAO; KAGUEI, 1982; WHITAKER, 1983) because it is valid
for porosities between 0.2 and 0.9 and for a wide range of Prandtl
numbers and low Reynolds numbers (Redp &amp;lt;100) (KUWAHARA et al.,
2001; PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). A more in-depth discussion regarding
the Nusselt number correlation is presented in Appendix C.

4.3.4 Effective Thermal Conductivity

The effective thermal conductivity is the volume-averaged thermal con-
ductivity used to evaluate the macroscopic heat transfer through a
porous medium. In the non-equilibrium formulation, there is an ef-
fective thermal conductivity for each phase, as will be presented as
follows.

4.3.4.1 Fluid Phase Effective Thermal Conductivity

The effective thermal conductivity of the fluid phase for parallel plates
and packed spheres is evaluated by (KAVIANY, 1995):

4.3.5 Longitudinal Dispersion

In 1-D porous media modeling, the dispersion is due to fluid mixing
along the bed, in the direction of flow. This way, the longitudinal
dispersion, D||, can be treated as an axial conduction term.

For parallel plates, D|| is calculated by the following equation suggested
by Engelbrecht (2008):

D||

For pin arrays, D|| is evaluated by the correlation proposed by DeGroot
and Straatman (2012) for a staggered array of circular cylinders:

D||

?f

where the Reynolds and Peclet numbers are based on the pin size,
d = epin. Thus, Red = uepin/?f and Ped = RedPr.

4.3.6 Wall Heat Transfer Coefficient

The heat transfer to the regenerator wall, hwall, is evaluated via Nus-
selt number correlations based on the particle diameter, i.e., Nuwall =
hwalldp/kf(T). For packed beds of spheres, the use of the empirical cor-
relation presented in Li and Finlayson (1977) is suggested. Thus (LI;
FINLAYSON, 1977; WAKAO; KAGUEI, 1982):

Nuwalldp = 0.17Re

4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Imple-
mentation

The adiabatic temperature change, ?Tad(?B,T) is illustrated in
Fig. 2.4. For a magnetic material at an equilibrium state specified
by an initial temperature T0 and magnetic field B0, the total entropy
is s0(B0,T0). If a variation in the applied field, ?B = B1 ? B0,
is performed adiabatically, the total entropy of the system remains
constant, and s1 = s0. Therefore, a new equilibrium state is reached at
s1(B1,T1). The difference between the initial and final temperatures
is the adiabatic temperature change, i.e., ?Tad(?B,T) = T1 ? T0. If
?B &gt; 0, then ?Tad(?B,T) is positive and, reversibly, when ?B &amp;lt;0,
?Tad(?B,T) is negative. An extended discussion on the calculation of
?Tad(?B,T) for magnetization and demagnetization, and its impact
on the regenerator performance is available in Bahl and Nielsen (2009),
Nielsen et al. (2010), Trevizoli et al. (2012). The implementation of the
MCE and of the demagnetizing losses on the AMR model are discussed
next.

4.4.1 Implementation of the Magnetocaloric Effect

In AMR modeling, the MCE may be implemented in two different
forms. The first is the so-called discrete approach, which is the simplest
and most straightforward calculation method (NIELSEN et al., 2011). It
consists of a direct temperature increment (or reduction) during the
magnetization (or demagnetization) step. Thus, for a one-dimensional
domain:

Ts(t + ?t,z) = Ts(t,z) + ?Tad(?B,Ts(t,z)) (4.41)

where ?B = B(t + ?t,z) ?B(t,z).

The second form is the so-called built-in approach, where the MCE is
modeled as an instantaneous energy rate per unit volume, q?MCE, which
is included as a source term in the solid energy equation (4.8) (NIELSEN
et al., 2011), where q?MCE is given by (ENGELBRECHT, 2008; NIELSEN et
al., 2011):



4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Implementation 105

q?MCE(t+?t,z) = ??s(1??)Ts(t,z)
?s(B(t,z),Ts(t,z))

?B(t,z)

?B(t,z)

?t
(4.42)

According to Nielsen et al. (2011), the processes of magnetization and
demagnetization can be simulated using both approaches, but the se-
lection of the most appropriate one depends on the conditions of the
simulation. When the magnetic flux density changes continuously with
time, such as in the magnetic circuits used in the present AMR ex-
perimental apparatus, the built-in approach is the best. On the other
hand, for a step change in the magnetic flux density, the simplest dis-
crete approach is sufficient. However, it should be noted that step
changes in magnetic flux density (magnetization and demagnetization)
are very hard to implement in practice, so the vast majority of AMR
apparatuses actually employ some type of continuous change in the
magnetic flux density. A drawback of the built-in approach is that it
requires somewhat refined data sets for the magnetocaloric properties
and specific heat capacity as a function of temperature and magnetic
flux density in order to calculate the entropy derivative. These may not
be always available, especially for new materials that rely heavily on
the experimental characterization of its parameters. As a result, when
the required data are not available, the discrete method may be the
only approach possible.

Both approaches to calculate the MCE were employed in the present
model. In each case, ?Tad and ?s/?B were calculated based on the
entropy lines in a T ?s diagram, as described earlier in Fig. 2.4. Eval-
uating the MCE from the T ? s diagram is the most advantageous
because it takes the reversibility of the MCE directly into account. As
will be seen in Section 4.7.2, if a refined magnetocaloric properties data
set (e.g., T ? s lines) is available, even for a continuous magnetic flux
density variation, both approaches give numerical results that are in
good agreement.

In terms of dimensionless parameters, the discrete and built-in methods
are given, respectively, by:

?s(t
? + ?t?,z?) = ?s(t

?,z?) +
?Tad(?B,Ts(t,z))

?THex

(4.44)

where ?THex = TH ? TC is the temperature difference between the
thermal reservoirs (i.e., hot and cold heat exchangers).

4.4.2 Magnetic Losses due to Demagnetizing Ef-
fects

When a magnetic material is subjected to a magnetic flux density, the
resulting (effective) magnetic field vector, ~Heff, is different from the

applied magnetic field, ~Hapl. This is due to an internal demagnetizing

field, ~Hdem, which is proportional to the demagnetizing tensor, ND,
and to the magnetization, ~M( ~Hapl,T). Thus (BAHL et al., 2008; SMITH
et al., 2010; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012, 2013b):

~Heff = ~Hapl ? ~Hdem( ~Hapl,T) (4.45)

where

~Hdem( ~Hapl,T) = ND · ~M( ~Hapl,T) (4.46)

If the product between the demagnetization tensor and the magneti-
zation is large, which is often the case when the material is in the
ferromagnetic phase (T &amp;lt;TCurie), then ~Hdem is also large, yielding val-

ues of ~Heff much smaller than ~Hapl. This constitutes a reduction in the
adiabatic temperature change of the magnetocaloric material and a loss
in terms of temperature span and cooling capacity. Thus, a properly
designed regenerator should have, in principle, a small demagnetizing
tensor (factor), which depends chiefly on the regenerator geometry and
orientation with respect to the applied field.

At a constant (uniform) temperature, Eq. (4.45) can be simplified as
the demagnetization tensor becomes a scalar. Thus, for a homogeneous
temperature solid:



4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Implementation 107

Heff = Hapl ?NDM(Hapl,T) (4.47)

where ND is the demagnetization factor. Trevizoli et al. (2012) showed
that, for the purpose of estimating losses due to internal demagnetiza-
tion effects in a parallel plate geometry regenerator, the assumption of
a constant (average) temperature gives values of Heff/Hapl which are
in good agreement (less than 15% error in the worst case, less that 4%
on average) with a more complex (i.e., vectorial) model that assumes
a linear temperature profile along the plates (SMITH et al., 2010).

Therefore, in the present model the effective magnetic field was cal-
culated using a simplified method that consists of assuming a linear
temperature profile (between TC and TH) along the regenerator bed
and calculating an average temperature for each finite volume in the
regenerator. Eq. (4.47) is used to calculate the local values of the ef-
fective magnetic field at each volume, which remain unchanged along
the entire simulation. Numerically, Eq. (4.47) is implemented as:

Heff(t,z) = Hapl(t,z) ?NDM(Hapl(t,z),T(t,z)) (4.48)

and the effective magnetic flux density, Beff(t,z) = µ0Heff(t,z).

The total demagnetization factor of an AMR matrix, ND, comprises the
demagnetization factor of the matrix geometry, ND,geo, and the demag-
netizing factor of the casing geometry that surrounds the regenerative
bed, ND,csg. Hence, ND was estimated using a correlation proposed for
a packed bed of particles available in (COEY, 2010):

ND = ND,geo + (1 ??)(ND,csg ?ND,geo) (4.49)

where ND,csg can be estimated via relations for cylindrical and pris-
matic geometries proposed, respectively, by Sato and Ishii (1989) and
Aharoni (1998). Eq. (4.49) is used for particle beds, such as spheres,
where the demagnetization factor of a single sphere is ND,geo = 1/3.
For comparison purposes, in all the remaining geometries studied in the
present thesis, the same equation will be used to evaluate ND. ND,geo
was calculated with the Sato and Ishii (1989) and Aharoni (1998) cor-
relations for square pins and plates, respectively.

4.4.3 Experimental Thermo-Magnetic Properties

Although the thermo-magnetic properties of magnetocaloric materials
can be evaluated by means of equations of state, such as the Weiss-
Debye-Sommerfeld (WDS) theory for materials with a continuous mag-
netic transition (MORRISH, 1965; DINESEN, 2004), better accuracy can
be achieved with interpolation curves derived from actual experimental
data, as discussed by Nielsen et al. (2011).

The AMR modeling benefits from the development of T-s curves
(diagram) as a function of the magnetic flux density to calculate ?Tad
as function of B and T . The dependence of the specific heat capacity
on B and T is also of fundamental importance, as is the character-
ization of the magnetization, M (or specific magnetization, ?), as a
function of B and T to estimate the demagnetization losses. The Gd
density and thermal conductivity were assumed equal to 7900 kg/m3

and 10.5 W/m-K, respectively (PETERSEN et al., 2008), and therefore,
independent of the magnetic flux density and temperature.

The commercial-grade gadolinium used in this thesis (99% purity) was
experimentally characterized in terms of its specific heat capacity and
magnetic entropy change. The thermo-magnetic properties were mea-
sured at magnetic flux densities between 0 and 2 T in 0.1-T intervals,
at temperatures ranging from 250 to 320 K, in steps of 1 K. The specific
heat and magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and
magnetic flux density were carried out by BASF. After processing the
data, non-linear interpolations were performed to correlate the data as
continuous functions of the magnetic flux density and temperature. All
interpolating functions presented correlation coefficients R2 &gt; 0.9999.

In the AMR model, the physical properties of Gd are calculated via
bi-linear interpolations of tabulated data generated through the non-
linear interpolating functions described above. These tabulated data
were generated with a resolution higher than that of the original data
(i.e., 0.01 T and 0.1 K, for the 0-2 T and 255-310 K ranges) to guarantee
high accuracy. Using the bi-linear interpolations instead of the continu-
ous interpolating functions reduces the computational time. Numerical
instabilities are also reduced in comparison with property estimation
using bi-linear interpolations applied directly on the original experi-
mental data.

sionless equations, Eqs. (4.5), (4.7), (4.9) and (4.12), can be written

4.5.1 Momentum Equation

The momentum equation, Eq. (4.5), is not position-dependent, since
the pressure gradient is approximated by a harmonic function, enabling
the adoption of a fully explicit discretization scheme, in which the right-
hand side of Eq. (4.5) is incorporated into the source term (PATANKAR,
1980; MALISKA, 2004). Table 4.1 identifies the generic variables in the
momentum equation.

The solver routine for the momentum equation is presented in Fig. 4.6.
The cold and hot blows are solved independently, and the total cy-
cle period is ??cycle = ?

HB = ??cycle. The cold blow starts at

t? = 0 and ends at t? = ??CB, while the hot blow starts at t
? = ??CB and

ends at t? = ??cycle. The model enables selecting different blow periods
(?CB 6= ?HB), but in all analyses presented in this thesis identical blow
periods have been considered.

The solver starts with the input mass flow rate (MFR in the Fig. 4.6)
and the cycle starts at t? = 0. Based on the input mass flow rate,
an initial value for the amplitude of the pressure drop waveform At is
adjusted, and Eq. (4.59) is solved. If the matrix geometry is composed
by packed spheres or pins, there is an internal loop to compute the
source term linearization, for which the convergence criterion tolerance
is 10-10. If the parallel plate geometry is selected, u?D is solved directly.
This procedure is repeated for all time steps until the end of the blow.
When all time steps are solved, the cycle convergence is verified, which
means comparing the values of u?D(t) corresponding to the current (?)
and the previous (??1) cycles. The convergence criterion is as follows:

????u?D(t?)|? ?u?D(t?)|??1
???? &amp;lt;10-8 (4.60)

where ? is the cycle count. The main loop is related to the convergence
of the input mass flow rate, for which the convergence criterion tol-
erance is 10-10. Based on the converged solution of the instantaneous
superficial velocity, u(t) = u?DuD,max is calculated from the blow (hot
and cold) average mass flow rate and compared with the input value,
i.e.:

boundary condition is set at z? = 0 with ??f

The boundary conditions for the solid phase are: ??s

(t?,z? = 1) = 0. The boundary matrix coefficients are determined
by energy balances on the solid phase boundaries. The coefficients
are identical to the ones presented above, with the following changes:
Aw = 0 to Cold or West boundary volume; Ae = 0 to Hot or East
boundary volume.

To accelerate the numerical convergence, linear temperature profiles,
i.e., ?f,s(z

? = 0) = 0 and ?f,s(z
? = 1) = 1 were assumed as initial

conditions for the fluid and solid energy equations. The solver was a
line-by-line Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA). This solver, also
known as the Thomas Algorithm, was chosen as it does not require
an iterative processes, such as other known methods (Jacobi or Gauss-
Seidel elimination).



4.5 Numerical Implementation 119

The fluid and solid energy equations are solved coupled. This means
that at any given time, the fluid equation is solved first, and its solution
is used to solve the solid energy equation before returning to the fluid
domain with a new solution for the solid phase. This procedure is
repeated until the convergence criteria are satisfied. Fig. 4.7 presents
the coupled solution routine.

After the solution of the momentum equation, the cycle starts at t? = 0
with the initial condition. A blow is identified as cold or hot, and, for
every time step, the internal loop of the energy equations are solved
until the convergence criterion of 10?6 is satisfied for both ?f and ?s. In
all iterations, the fluid and solid properties are recalculated based on
the previous ?f and ?s solution. If the convergence criterion is satisfied,
the next time step is solved. After all time steps are solved, the cycle
convergence is verified, which consists of comparing the solutions ?f,s(t)
from the current (?) and previous (? ? 1) cycles with the convergence
criterion as follows:

?????f,s(z?, t?)|? ??f,s(z?, t?)|??1
???? &amp;lt;10-6 (4.73)

If the convergence criterion is not satisfied, the solver returns to the be-
ginning of the cycle, but using the previous temperature fields as initial
conditions. This procedure is repeated until all convergence criteria are
respected.

4.5.3 Void Volume

The implementation of the energy equation for the fluid in the void
volume, Eq. (4.12), is similar to that for the fluid in the porous medium,
for which the fully implicit scheme was used. Table 4.3 identifies the
generic variables in the void volume energy equation.

Eq. (4.74) is solved for the cold and hot void volumes. However, the
boundary conditions are different, depending on the blow direction.
Using fictitious volumes to implement the boundary conditions, the
matrix coefficients are calculated as explained below.

? If u? &gt; 0 - cold blow: The fluid coming from the cold reservoir
enters the cold void volume, flows through the regenerator and
through the hot void volume, up to the hot reservoir.

On the cold side, the fluid coming from the cold reservoir enters the
cold void volume and the fluid exiting this void volume enters the re-
generator. Thus, at z? = ?L?vv, an inlet boundary condition is applied,
in which ?

C,vv
f = ?C = 0. At z

? = 0, an outflow boundary condition is

applied, i.e.,
??

C,vv
f

?z?
= 0. Here, L?vv = Lvv/LReg. The matrix coefficients

are defined as follows:



122 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

West boundary volume: East boundary volume:
Aw = 0 Aw = 1
Ae = 0 Ae = 0

Bp = ?C = 0 Bp = 0
Ap = 1 Ap = 1

On the hot side, the fluid leaving the regenerator enters the hot void
volume and flows towards the hot reservoir. Thus, at z? = 1, an inlet
boundary condition is applied, in which ?

H,vv
f = ?f|z* = 1. At z

? =

1 +L?vv, an outflow boundary condition is applied, i.e.,
??

H,vv
f

?z?
= 0. The

matrix coefficients are, therefore:

West boundary volume: East boundary volume:
Aw = 0 Aw = 1
Ae = 0 Ae = 0

Bp = ?f|z* = 1 Bp = 0
Ap = 1 Ap = 1

? If u? &amp;lt;0 - hot blow: The fluid coming from the hot reservoir
enters the hot void volume, flows through the regenerator and
through the cold void volume, down to the cold reservoir.

On the hot side, at z? = 1+L?vv, an inlet boundary condition is applied,

in which ?
H,vv
f = ?H = 1. At z

? = 1, an outflow boundary condition is

applied, i.e.,
??

H,vv
f

?z?
= 0. The matrix coefficients are given by:

Ae = 1 Ae = 0
Bp = 0 Bp = ?H = 1
Ap = 1 Ap = 1

On the cold side, at z? = 0, an inlet boundary condition is applied, in
which ?

C,vv
f = ?f|z* = 0. At z

? = ?L?vv, an outflow boundary condition
is set, i.e.,

??
C,vv

?z?

West boundary volume: East boundary volume:
Aw = 0 Aw = 0
Ae = 1 Ae = 0
Bp = 0 Bp = ?f|z* = 0
Ap = 1 Ap = 1

The initial condition for the fluid in the cold void volume is the temper-
ature of the cold reservoir, ?Cvvf = ?C = 0. For the hot void volume, the
initial condition is the temperature of the hot reservoir, ?Hvvf = ?H = 1.
The TDMA was also used in the void volume solver. As explained ear-
lier, the main impact of the void volume on the regenerator behavior
is the change of the inlet temperature during the cold and hot blows,
which means that, when the void volumes are taken into account, the
boundary conditions for Eq. (4.62), originally presented in Section 4.5.2,
have to be updated. Hence, when the void volumes are considered, the
new boundary conditions for the energy equation of the fluid phase are
given by:

? For u? &gt; 0 - cold blow:

Cold or West boundary volume: Hot or East boundary volume:
Aw = 0 Aw = 1
Ae = 0 Ae = 0

Bp = ?

4.5.4 Casing Heat Transfer

and (4.18), were also discretized using a fully implicit scheme. Table

. Due to the large thermal mass of the magnetic circuit, this is

aries are presented below, with the fictitious volumes considered at each
end.

The linear temperature distribution used as initial condition in the
porous solid and fluid flow equations were also adopted in the casing
and air gap models. The TDMA was used, but with an additional
convergence loop for the y direction. Thus, convergence is obtained
when two successive iterations satisfy the following criterion:

?????(wall,air)(t?,y?,z?)|i ??(wall,air)(t?,y?,z?)|i?1
???? &amp;lt;10-6 (4.76)

where i is the current iteration and i?1 is the previous iteration. The
casing heat transfer model is solved coupled with the fluid and solid
porous medium energy equations, as will be detailed in the next section.

4.5.5 Complete Regenerator Simulation Routine

The complete regenerator routine is presented in Fig. 4.8. The solver
starts with the solution of the momentum equation. After, the pas-
sive and AMR solvers can be selected and solved independently. Each
calculation procedure is presented in detail as follows:

? Passive regenerator:

The routine is divided between the cold and hot blows. In the cold
blow routine, the cold void volume energy equation is computed and
its solution is used as the west boundary condition in the regenerator
fluid phase model. Then, the internal fluid-solid energy equations are
solved coupled and the fluid exiting the regenerator is used as the west
boundary condition in the hot void volume. In the hot blow routine, the
hot void volume energy equation is computed and its solution is used
as the east boundary condition in the regenerator fluid phase model.
Then, the internal fluid-solid energy equations are solved coupled and

128 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

the fluid exiting the regenerator is used as the east boundary condition
in the cold void volume. The procedure is repeated for each time step
until convergence is achieved. After that, the following parameters are
calculated: thermal effectiveness, pressure drop, pumping power and
entropy generation per unit volume (to be defined in Sections 5.2 and
7.1).

? Active magnetic regenerator:

The routine starts with the evaluation of magnetic losses. Later, it is
also divided between the cold and hot blows. In the cold blow routine,
the cold void volume energy equation is calculated and its solution is
used as the west boundary condition for the regenerator fluid phase
model. Then, the MCE and q??csg are computed and incorporated in the
solid and fluid energy equations, respectively. Next, the fluid exiting
the regenerator is used as the west boundary condition for the hot void
volume. The hot blow routine is similar. The procedure is repeated for
each time step until convergence is achieved. After that, the following
parameters are calculated: cooling capacity, regenerator temperature
span, pressure drop, pumping power and entropy generation per unit
volume (to be defined in Sections 6.3 and 7.1).

4.6 Numerical Mesh and Convergence
Evaluation

An evaluation of the numerical mesh was performed based on differ-
ences between converged results for different mesh sizes and the over-
all computing time associated with each mesh. Four different meshes
were evaluated: the temporal mesh, the porous medium z-direction
mesh, the void volume z-direction mesh and the casing heat transfer
y-direction mesh.

The porous medium heat transfer model was used to evaluate the tem-
poral and the porous medium z-direction meshes together. In this
analysis, four different mesh sizes were investigated, as shown in Table
4.5.

As presented in Table 4.5, the mesh sizes double with each mesh num-
ber. For both the passive and AMR regenerators, the mesh evaluation

was performed based on the results for several different operating con-
ditions, but only three cases were selected for the present discussion.
As shows in Table 4.6, Cases 1, 2 and 3 have different regenerator
lengths and cycle frequencies to test the sensitivity of these parameters
with respect to the temporal and spatial mesh sizes. The remaining
variables of the packed bed of spheres regenerator, i.e., mass flow rate,
particle diameter, porosity, and cold and hot reservoirs temperatures,
were kept constant.

For passive regenerators, the mesh evaluation was made based on the
thermal effectiveness, ?. Table 4.7 shows the results for the mesh evalua-
tion for passive regenerators for Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36,
m? = 50 kg/h, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. In Table 4.7, the variable
? = 100 × (?n ? ?n-1)/?n is the effectiveness difference between two
consecutive meshes, i.e., n and n?1. t is the total computational time
for each case.

4 0.961 0.1 718 0.981 0.1 2790 0.970 0.3 857

The results for passive regenerator show that there is some improve-
ment in the effectiveness results when the mesh is refined. However,



130 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method

when the computational time, t, is evaluated, it can be concluded that
the improvement in the effectiveness is minor when compared with
the increasing computational cost. This means that Mesh 3 provides
the best compromise. The passive regenerator mesh evaluation can
also be evaluated in terms of the ideal regenerator solution available
in Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998). Fig. 4.9 shows plots of the regen-
erator effectiveness as a function of the NTU for the different meshes.
The parameters of the matrix simulated in this analysis are as follows:
Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, f = 1 Hz,
TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. The mass flow rate was varied from 10
to 200 kg/h. These results led to the same conclusion i.e., that Mesh 3
appears to be the best option. The ideal regenerator simplification and
model are presented and discussed in more details in Section 4.7.1.

parameters: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, m? = 50 kg/h,
TH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K. The instantaneous magnetic flux
density was varied between 0 and 1 T. In Table 4.8 the variable ? =
100 × (Q?n ? Q?n-1)/Q?n is the cooling capacity difference between two
consecutive meshes, i.e., n and n? 1.

The results in Table 4.8 show that the AMR solution is more sensi-
tive to the mesh size. Nevertheless, they also indicate that Mesh 3 is
the most appropriate option because a more refined mesh (Mesh 4) in-
creases significantly the total computational time, especially when the
void volume and casing heat transfer models are solved. Moreover, the
benefit of using Mesh 4 is only a 4.9% improvement over Mesh 3, for
the worst case (Case 3).

An evaluation of the void volume z-direction and casing heat transfer
y-direction meshes was also carried out. In order to evaluate the void
volume mesh, several simulations were undertaken varying the void
volume size and the z-direction mesh size between 10 and 200 volumes.
The temporal mesh had 360 time steps and the porous medium spatial
mesh had 200 volumes. Here, only one void volume mesh analysis
is presented, whose results were obtained considering the simulation
conditions from Case 3 in Table 4.8, i.e., Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100
mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, f = 0.5 Hz, m? = 50 kg/h. For the
passive regenerator tests, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K, while for the
AMR simulations TH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K. The instantaneous
magnetic flux density was varied between 0 and 1 T. Also, a void volume
fraction of 15% was used.

The results shown in Table 4.9 demonstrate that the passive regenerator
solution is less sensitive to the void volume mesh size when compared
to the AMR solution. Additionally, the refining of the mesh size did not
increase significantly the computational time. Therefore, a z-direction
mesh of 100 finite volumes was selected for the void volume.

Regarding the casing heat transfer model, the y-direction wall mesh
was also evaluated based on several simulations. Considering the same
conditions of Case 3, i.e., Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36,
m? = 50 kg/h, TH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K, a G10 casing with a
2-mm wall thickness and an air gap of 1 mm was simulated. These wall
thickness and air gap dimensions are in agreement with the actual AMR
apparatus discussed in this thesis. The temporal mesh had 360 time
steps and the porous medium spatial mesh had 200 volumes. According
to the results, the air layer did not require a refined mesh, so only
5 finite volumes were used. On the other hand, the wall in contact
with the porous medium, where the temperature and flow velocities
are changing continuously, requires a more refined mesh due to the
transient heat transfer between the porous matrix and the wall. Hence,
the y-direction wall mesh was evaluated for 10, 20 and 40 volumes.

Table 4.10 presents the results of the mesh study for the casing heat
transfer modeling. Based on these results a y-direction mesh with 20
finite volumes was selected. In addition, the results in Table 4.10 shows
that the increase in the total simulation time when the casing heat
transfer model is included in the model cannot be neglected.

In summary, the following mesh characteristics were selected as the
best compromise between accuracy and computational time for both
passive and active regenerators:



4.7 Initial Model Verification 133

? Temporal mesh: 360 time steps;

? Regenerator z-direction mesh: 200 finite volumes;

? Void volume z-direction mesh: 100 finite volumes;

? Casing y-direction mesh: 20 finite volumes;

In general words, for the AMR simulations a more refined mesh would
be the best option. However, when the void volume and casing heat
transfer models are considered, the computational time increases sig-
nificantly. Thus, smaller meshes are more appropriate for comparisons
with the experimental data and the generation of results in the opti-
mization routine. The latter requires a significant number (around 10k)
of simulated scenarios.

4.7 Initial Model Verification

The initial model validation is discussed in this section. First, the ideal
passive regenerator model is presented and compared with Dragutino-
vic and Baclic (1998). The following parameters were changed: spheres
size, operating frequency, plates thickness and porosity of the parallel
plate regenerator. Next, it is demonstrated that the built-in and dis-
crete implementations of the MCE give the same cooling capacity, when
a refined data set of the magnetocaloric properties are available.

4.7.1 Ideal Passive Regenerator Model

To simulate the ideal regenerator behavior the simplifications discussed
in Section 2.5 were implemented in the numerical model. This first
verification is an important step to evaluate the iterative routine solver
and also the mesh sensitivity analysis presented previously.

The first comparison between the ideal regenerator model and the nu-
merical results considers a packed bed of spheres with different particle
sizes, i.e., dp = 0.5 mm, dp = 0.8 mm, dp = 1 mm and dp = 2 mm.
The operating conditions were: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100 mm,
? = 0.36, f = 1 Hz, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. The mass flow rate
was varied between 10 and 200 kg/h. Fig. 4.10 plots the regenerator
effectiveness as a function of the NTU, which varies from 5 to 750. A

was kept fixed at 1 mm. The remaining operating conditions were
the same as in the first comparison. Fig. 4.11 plots the regenerator
effectiveness as a function of the NTU between 20 and 200. The results

The third comparison considers a parallel plate matrix with a constant
porosity of ? = 0.36 and different plate thickness, ePP, of 0.25, 0.5, and
1 mm. The other operating conditions were as follows: square sectional
area with WReg = 13 mm, LReg = 91 mm, f = 1 Hz, TH = 320 K and
TC = 280 K. The mass flow rate was ranged from 10 to 200 kg/h.

a constant plate thickness of ePP = 0.25 mm and variable porosity
of 0.2, 0.36 and 0.5. The other operating conditions were the same

As presented in Figs. 4.10, 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13, all comparisons between
the numerical model and the ideal regenerator solution of Dragutinovic
and Baclic (1998) were in very good agreement. This means that the
coupled solution of the energy equations for the fluid and solid phases
was executed correctly, the convergence tolerances were satisfactorily
selected and the solver iterative routine was successfully implemented.
Therefore, it is believed that the inclusion in the numerical model of
non-idealities such as the time-dependent properties and mass flow rate,
axial heat conduction and viscous dissipation will result in physically
consistent behavior that will not depend on the numerical implemen-
tation.

4.7.2 Validation of the MCE Implementation

The validation of the MCE implementation is an important step be-
fore running the final AMR simulations. This section compares the
two different types of MCE implementation, discussed in Section 4.4.1,
namely the discrete and the built-in methods subjected to a contin-
uous sinusoidal magnetic flux density waveform between 0 and 1 T.
The regenerator matrix dimensions are: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100
mm, dp = 1 mm and ? = 0.36. The hot reservoir temperature was
kept constant at TH = 300 K, while the reservoir temperature span
was allowed to vary. Five different operating conditions were evalu-
ated, changing the operating frequency and the mass flow rate. The
utilization changed as a consequence. Table 4.11 shows the simulation
conditions of each case.

Fig. 4.14 shows the numerical results for the five cases, in which the con-

tinuous line correspond to the results of the discrete approach and the
open circles are for the built-in approach. As expected, when a refined
data set of the magnetocaloric properties are available, both approaches
have to return about the same converged results for the cooling capac-
ity, even when a continuous magnetic flux density variation is imposed.
These results lead to the conclusion that both MCE approaches were
successfully implemented in the AMR modeling. However, the discrete
approach was selected for the AMR evaluation performed in this thesis.

4.8 RegSim Development 139

4.8 RegSim Development

The numerical model, RegSim - Regenerator Simulator, was written in
Delphi 7. The user interface was divided in different palettes to enable
easy understanding of the type of regenerator being simulated, selection
of materials and heat transfer fluid, operating parameters and losses
modeling. The RegSim interface is shown in Fig. 4.15. The simulator
enables the following features:

? Selection of the problem to be solved, i.e., momentum equation
only, single blow regenerator, passive regenerator or AMR;

? Selection of four different regenerator matrix geometries, namely,
spheres, pins, parallel plates and micro-channels;

? Selection of three different fluid flow waveforms: instantaneous,
sinusoidal and trapezoidal, which is characteristic of rotary valves;

? Selection of five different applied magnetic field waveforms: in-
stantaneous, sinusoidal, rectified sinusoidal (used in the present
thesis), trapezoidal and rotor-stator.

? Selection of different operating conditions, defined in terms of
the reservoir temperatures, operating frequencies and mass flow
rates;

? Selection of the losses models to simulate: casing heat transfer,
void volume and magnetic losses.

Also, the interface enables selecting ranges of several parameters to be
simulated. For example, if the mass flow rate needs to be varied between
10 and 100 kg/h, in intervals of 10 kg/h, these can be directly input via
the user interface so that the simulations will run sequentially. This
is very important in the simulations carried out in the optimization
procedure.

5 Passive Thermal
Regenerators

The study of passive regenerator is the basis to understand the heat
transfer, fluid flow and losses in the regenerative matrix. Addition-
ally, the experience acquired with the instrumentation and transient
measurements during the passive experiments was valuable to define
the AMR experimental procedure. The present chapter shows the ex-
perimental and numerical evaluation of passive thermal regenerators,
starting with the time dependent measurements of temperature, pres-
sure drop and mass flow rate. Next, the data regression and the metrics
used to evaluate the numerical and experimental results are presented.
The comparison between the data and numerical results is presented
at the end of the chapter.

5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements

The time-dependent measurements performed by different transducers
are used to calculate the time-average values that characterize the main
system variables. As explained in Chapter 3, in all transient measure-
ments, a total of 5 cycles with 300 data points per cycle were used
to evaluate the time-average metrics. The transient measurements are
explained next.

5.1.1 Temperature Measurements

A passive regenerator test starts with the regenerator at a given ini-
tial condition and the setting of the temperatures of the two thermal



142 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

reservoirs. The hot and cold reservoirs were kept at 320 and 280 K,
respectively, in all tests. The ambient temperature was at 300 ± 2 K.
Fig. 5.1 shows a typical evolution of the temperature at the cold (TCE)
and hot (THE) ends, and the internal temperatures at different posi-
tions (Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, Ti4 and Ti5). Having started at around 300 K, the
temperatures reach the periodically developed regime in a few minutes.
It is possible to observe the symmetry between the cold and hot sides of
the regenerator, which is a consequence of the well balanced operating
conditions, i.e., equal blow periods and blow-average mass flow rates.

In the periodically developed regime, the last five cycles of the total

Fig. 5.2 shows the last five cycles for four different tests, as presented in
Table 5.1. Additionally, Fig. 5.3 shows the temperature profiles in these
tests immediately after the hot blow (open symbols) and immediately
after the cold blow (solid symbols).

Test#4 #1 1 1.25 1 ? 14 13.90

The conditions of Test #1, Fig. 5.2(a), result in a high thermal effec-
tiveness. Ti1 and Ti5 never get close to the reservoirs temperatures, TH
and TC, which gives rise to almost linear temperature profiles at the
end of the blows, as seen in Fig. 5.3. Also, the internal temperature
readings have sinusoidal shapes with small temperature amplitudes (of
the order of 5 K), which are typical of high effectiveness, as a result of
high NTU matrices and low utilization conditions.

Conversely, the conditions of Test #2, Fig. 5.2(b), are those of a low
effectiveness regenerator. Now, only the middle probe, Ti3, has a per-
fect sinusoidal behavior, but with a large amplitude approaching 40 K.
In this case, Ti1 and Ti2 reach TH at the end of the cold blow and, sym-
metrically, Ti4 and Ti5 reach TC at the end of the hot blow. As a result,
the temperature profiles at the end of the blows are no longer linear,
and there is a significant penetration of the constant temperature of
the reservoirs into the matrix, due to the large displaced fluid volumes
in the blows associated with a large utilization factor. In this case,
close to 30% of the regenerator length, closer to the reservoirs, attain
the reservoir temperature after each blow. As a consequence, the out-
let blow time-dependent temperature also presents a large amplitude,
which is typical of low effectiveness, resulted from low NTU matrices
and large utilization conditions.

Tests #3 and #4, Figs. 5.2(c) and (d), were carried out to compare
two matrices at the same operating conditions (frequency and superfi-
cial velocity), but with different values of utilization and NTU, since
the Casing #1 has only half the volume of Casing #3. As expected,
the results show clearly the effects of utilization and interstitial heat
transfer area on the regenerator performance, since the results for Cas-
ing #3 are in much better agreement with the behavior expected for a
high effectiveness matrix than Casing #1.

Fig. 5.4 shows the time-dependent temperature at the regenerator hot
end during two consecutive cycles. The tests were conducted with
Casing #3 with 1-mm spheres. While Fig. 5.4(a) is for a constant
utilization of approximately 0.62 and variable frequency, Fig. 5.4(b) is
for a constant frequency of 0.5 Hz and variable utilization.

For a fixed utilization, Fig. 5.4(a), the fluid displaced volume does
not change with frequency. However, the average fluid velocity and
the mass flow rate increase with frequency because the fluid volume is
displaced faster through the porous medium. The mass flow rate results
in a lower NTU, which causes the temperature of the fluid exiting the
regenerator to reach lower and lower values at the end of the cold blow
as the frequency increases. With a fixed displaced volume, the reservoir
temperature penetration is very little affected by the frequency, as seen
in Fig. 5.5(a), which shows the longitudinal temperature profiles at the
end of the blows for the fixed utilization condition.

5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements 149

For the condition of Fig. 5.4(b), increasing the utilization for a constant
frequency means displacing a larger fluid volume through the matrix
in the same period of time. This, at the same time as it enhances the
interstitial heat transfer coefficient, it also increases the reservoir tem-
perature penetration in the matrix as a result of a higher utilization.
The latter effect can be perceived quite clearly in Fig. 5.5(b), which
shows the axial temperature profiles becoming more deviated from the
linear behavior as the utilization increases. It is clear from Figs. 5.4(b)
and 5.5(b) that the increase in utilization reduces significantly the ef-
fectiveness of the regenerator.

5.1.2 Mass Flow Rate Measurement

The mass flow rate is varied when the frequency or utilization are
changed. Fig. 5.6 shows the transient response of the Coriolis mass
flow meter. Fig. 5.6(a) is for a constant utilization of approximately
0.62 and a variable frequency, and Fig. 5.6(b) is for a constant frequency
of 0.25 Hz and a variable utilization.

As explained in Chapter 3, the Coriolis mass flow meter is not capable
of measuring fast transients. Ideally, during the cold blow period, the
flow rate measured by the cold-side MFM should be the first top half of
the sinusoidal flow waveform, while the flow rate given by the hot-side
MFM should be zero. During the hot blow, the behavior should be
the opposite, i.e., the cold-side MFM should read zero flow, while the
hot-side MFM should give the last bottom half of the flow waveform
(see Fig. 3.15). This behavior is somewhat followed at low frequencies
(0.25 and 0.5 Hz), as can be seen in Fig. 5.6(a), but fails at frequencies
above 0.75 Hz, since the flow rate measurements no longer go to zero
during the opposite blows. It should be mentioned that the mass flow
rate measurements are not in phase with the other transient measure-
ments, with the dephasing increasing with the frequency. In Fig. 5.6(a),
however, the dephasing has been corrected.

At higher operating frequencies, the transient measurement do not
reach the maximum instantaneous (peak) flow rate or the zero flow rate
due to second-order (time constant) effects in the flow meters. How-
ever, the blow-average mass flow rate is still calculated with reasonable
accuracy, as can be seen in Fig. 5.7. This figure shows the experimen-
tal blow-average mass flow rate as a function of the reference average
mass flow rate calculated by Eq. (3.1). The results shown in this figure

were obtained with Casing #3 using 1-mm spheres. A good agreement
is observed between the cold (solid symbols) and hot (open symbols)
blow-average mass flow rates. The deviations between the experimen-
tal data and the reference curve are of the order of the experimental
uncertainty, which were observed to increase with frequency. For this
reason, the reference value (calculated based on the system frequency
and the piston displacement) was used to determine parameters such
as the NTU, Redp, friction factor and pumping power. The data trend
presented in Fig. 5.7 was observed in all other test conditions.

At low frequencies the time-dependent mass flow rate measurements are
in agreement with the expected sinusoidal waveform. Fig. 5.6(b) shows
the measurements for different utilizations at a constant frequency of
0.25 Hz. This enables identifying the no flow period for ? ? 0.11, shown
in greater detail in Fig. 5.6(c). The no flow period occurs when a small
amount of fluid is pumped using pump PP42.5 with strokes between

The numerical results show a perfect sinusoidal waveform. Deviations
such as those shown in Fig. 5.6(c) can lead to differences between the
modeling and experimental results, which will be explained later.

5.1.3 Pressure Drop Measurements

Fig. 5.8 shows the last five cycles of the time-dependent total pressure
drop for two different tests. Fig. 5.8(a) is for a constant utilization of
approximately 0.62 and a variable frequency, and Fig. 5.8(b) is for a
constant frequency of 0.5 Hz with a variable utilization. Again, these
figures refer to Casing #3 with 1-mm spheres. The results show clearly
the sinusoidal waveform characteristic of double effect pumps. At low
mass flow rates, the influence of the check valves is small, given that
there is little distortion of the sinusoidal profiles. However, the no flow

periods are not captured in great detail, since two absolute pressure
transducers were used to measure the pressure drop instead of a dif-
ferential pressure transducer. This usually increases the experimental
uncertainties.

As expected, the mass flow rate changes when frequency or utilization
are changed. Thus, when either one is increased keeping the other
constant, the peak of the total pressure drop increases. As will be shown
further ahead, these results will be used to determine the cycle-averaged
porous medium pressure drop by subtracting the average pressure drop
in the tubing from the blow-average total pressure drop.

5.2 Performance Metrics and Data Regres-
sion

The passive regenerator evaluation is carried out in terms of the ?-
NTU relationship, which represents the thermal performance of the
matrix, and of the pressure drop, friction factor and pumping power as
a function of the Reynolds number, which quantify the viscous losses.
Based on these metrics, the regenerative matrices can be compared.

The data regression to calculate the effectiveness is based on the time-
dependent temperature measurements at the hot, THE, and cold, TCE,
ends. All tests were carried out under balanced flow conditions
(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997), i.e., m?cp,f|CB =
m?cp,f|HB. Thus, the effectiveness can be defined only as a function
of the temperatures:

5.2 Performance Metrics and Data Regression 155

where ? is the cycle period and ? = 5 is the number of cycles used
in the data regression. To correct for oscillations in the temperature
readings, the reservoir temperatures were calculated as the averages
of the inlet constant temperatures (see Fig. 5.2). In all cases, TH =
320 ± 0.15 K and TC = 280 ± 0.15 K. The differentiation between
the two definitions of effectiveness, i.e., of the cold blow (measured
at the hot end) and of the hot blow (measured at the cold end), is
an important one because even when the regenerator operates under
balanced flow conditions, the effectivenesses defined by Eqs. (5.1) and
(5.2) may not be the same, generating an effectiveness imbalance, ??,
defined as (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981):

?? =
?CB
?HB

(5.3)

An effectiveness imbalance greater or smaller than unity can be as-
sociated with different physical phenomena (axial heat conduction,
temperature-dependent properties), which may act independently or
combined (TREVIZOLI et al., 2014). Also, the imbalance may be at-
tributed to a bad regenerator assembly, as will be explained below.

156 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

The blow-averaged total pressure drop is composed by the porous me-
dium and the tubing average pressure drops. The tubing pressure drop,
?P tub, includes the tubing itself, T- and Y-junctions and the empty
regenerator housing. The porous medium average pressure drop is the
actual frictional loss through the porous medium, ?P , and is the quan-
tity used in the comparison with the modeling results. Thus:

?P = ?P tot ? ?P tub (5.7)

?P tub varies according to the geometry of the regenerator housing.
For instance, Casing #1 has the same housing diameter, but a shorter
housing length and a longer tubing length compared with Casing #3.
Casing #4 has a smaller housing diameter, but the same housing and
tubing lengths as Casing #3. Thus, for a precise determination of the
porous medium average pressure drop, ?P tub was experimentally eval-
uated via single (unidirectional) blow tests performed on all regenerator
housings under variable mass flow rates between 10 and 180 kg/h.

The friction factor, fD, is a non-dimensional form of the pressure drop.
For porous media, it can be calculated as follows, using the blow-
averaged pressure drop as follows (KAVIANY, 1995):

fD =
?3

dp
?fu2

?P

(5.8)

The blow-averaged pumping power required to overcome the viscous

losses of the fluid through the porous medium, W? pump, is given by:

W? pump =
m?

?f
?P (5.9)

Since the regenerator operates at balanced conditions, it is expected,

as will be seen, that ?P HB ? ?P CB, fD,HB ? fD,CB and W? pump,HB ?
W? pump,CB.

All time integrations presented in this section were performed numeri-
cally using the extended Simpson’s rule (PRESS et al., 2007):

where N is the total number of points used to calculate the numerical

averaged variables and 150 points for blow-averaged variables.

5.2.1 Uncertainty Analysis

The experimental uncertainties were evaluated based on the procedures
presented in INMETRO (2003) and Holman (2006). The metrics were
calculated based on experimental measurements of independent vari-
ables, such as temperature, pressure and mass flow rate. Thus, the
uncertainty of a dependent variable R (uR) is a combination of the un-
certainties of each independent variable (ux1,ux2,ux3, ...,uxn). Thus:

uR =

)2
+

(
?R

?x2

)2
+ · · · +

(

(5.11)

For instance, the total blow-averaged pressure drop is a function of the
instantaneous pressure and time measurements, ?P tot = f(?P(t), t)
as shown in Eqs. (5.5) and (5.6). Thus, the uncertainty related with
?P tot is calculated by:

u?Ptot =

(

(5.12)

where u?P(t) = f(Pout,Pin) and ?sd is the standard deviation calcu-

lated from the averaged values of ?P tot obtained in each of the five
cycles:



158 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

?sd =

???? ??
i=1

(
?Ptot,i ? ?P tot

(5.13)

Additionally, the numerical integration is a summation (R =

and the uncertainty of such a function is given by (HOLMAN, 2006):

uR =

[?( ?R
?x1

ux1

)2]1/2
=

(aiux1)

(5.14)

Thus, substituting Eq. (5.14) in Eq. (5.12) gives:

(5.15)

where u? and u?t are the uncertainties of the cycle frequency (or period)
and the time increment, respectively. These time uncertainties were
calculated based on the error associated with the frequency calculation
from the linear potentiometer and on the stepper motor resolution.
The time increment, ?t, is the same used in the numerical integration
using Eq. (5.10). The third term in Eq. (5.15) results from the fact
that there is a correlation between ? and ?t, so their uncertainties are
also correlated. Finally, ai are the coefficients in the extended Simpson
rule.

Similar procedures to evaluate experimental uncertainties were per-
formed for all variables that required numerical integration. Variables
that did not require numerical integration, such as ??, ?P (porous me-
dia pressure drop) and fD, had their uncertainties directly evaluated
by Eq. (5.11).

Finally, the expanded uncertainty (UR) is calculated by:

UR = tsuR (5.16)



5.3 Experimental Results 159

where ts is the Student’s t-distribution calculated based on the effective
number of degrees of freedom and on the confidence level.

The expanded uncertainties of the experimental measurements were
presented in Table 3.10. These were obtained from either calibration
or from manufacturer’s catalog in the following manner: (i) if UR was
evaluated from calibration, a normal distribution is assumed, with a
95% confidence level and infinite degrees of freedom. Hence, uR =
UR/2; (ii) if UR was evaluated from catalog information, as suggested
by INMETRO (2003), a rectangular distribution is assumed with 68%
confidence interval and, thus, uR = UR/

5.3 Experimental Results

5.3.1 Reproducibility of the Experimental Results

The reproducibility of the experiments was verified by means of a pro-
cedure consisting of the following steps:

1. Disassembling of the passive apparatus and removal of the regen-
erative matrix from the housing;

2. Rebuilding of the regenerative matrix, following the step-by-step
procedure described in Appendix B for the packed bed of spheres;

3. Reassembling of the passive apparatus, including all the instru-
mentation;

4. Execution of 32 experimental tests varying the utilization and the
operating frequency;

The procedure was repeated three times by two different operators
(PVT and GFP), as presented in Table 5.2. Casing #3 and 1-mm
diameter spheres with a porosity of 0.363 ± 0.005 were used as the
regenerative matrix. Assembly #1 was the first experimental evalua-
tion of the passive system, for which the operator PVT was involved in
the assembling itself and in running tests. In Assembly #2, a second
operator (GFP) performed the same procedure as in Assembly #1. In
a third test, Assembly #3, conducted by operator PVT, the hot and

Fig. 5.9 shows the reproducibility tests results for the porous medium
pressure drop, ?P , as a function of Redp for the three assemblies pre-
sented in Table 5.2. Fig. 5.9 also shows the numerical results for ?P .
A good agreement is observed between the experimental and numerical
results, with similar trends for all assemblies. The deviations observed
for some individual points are of the order of the experimental uncer-
tainties, which was about 2.5 kPa for all experimental points. The
uncertainty of Redp is about 1%.

5.3.2 Effectiveness Imbalance

An effectiveness imbalance greater or smaller than unity can be asso-
ciated with different physical phenomena (axial heat conduction, tem-
perature dependent properties), which may act independently or com-
bined. The imbalance may also be caused by poor assembling of the
packed bed, such as porosities higher than 36% or an axially variable
porosity. Trevizoli et al. (2014) presented some results for the effec-
tiveness imbalance for three different matrices composed by stainless
steel, lead and gadolinium spheres. They identified a severe effective-
ness imbalance in the lead and gadolinium passive regenerators. This
was attributed to axial heat conduction effects and, in the case of Gd,
also to the specific heat capacity variation with temperature.



162 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

Contrary to Gd, the thermophysical properties of stainless steel are not
strongly dependent on temperature. As an example of the small impact
on the effectiveness, Fig. 5.11 shows the results for the effectiveness
imbalance as a function of NTU for Casing #3 for spheres sizes of 0.5
and 1 mm.

Therefore, since all the passive regenerator experiments are highly re-
producible, and have only been performed using stainless steel matrices,
the effectiveness imbalance is expected to be around unity for all cases
in this thesis. Hence, the effectiveness results will be represented either
by the cold or hot blow effectiveness, since they are always very similar.

5.3.3 Packed Bed Regenerator

5.3.3.1 Pressure Drop and Pumping Power

The blow-averaged porous medium pressure drop - calculated according
to Eq. (5.7) - is shown in Fig. 5.12 as a function of Redp for three
different spheres sizes (0.5, 0.8 and 1 mm diameter) and Casings #1
to #4. As expected for packed bed porous media, the pressure drop
exhibits a linear trend at low Redp, which is typical of the Stokes flow
regime at which Darcy’s law is valid. At higher velocities, the pressure
drop deviates from Darcy’s law and a parabolic behavior is observed
with respect to Redp (inertial regime).

For all casings, ?P is inversely proportional to the particle size. Also,
Redp extends over longer ranges as the particle diameter increases. The
following remarks can be made considering a constant sphere diameter:

1. For Casings #1, #2 and #3, both the superficial velocities and
the Redp ranges are the same, since the housing diameter is iden-
tical in these casings. Therefore, the increase observed in ?P
is due to the increasing housing length, as ?P increases linearly
with the regenerator length;

2. Casings #3 and #4 have the same regenerator length, but the
housing diameter is different. Thus, the superficial velocity for
Casing #4 is higher than in Casing #3 and, as a consequence,
the Redp range is longer for Casing #4. As a result, for identical
operating conditions, i.e., displaced volume and frequency, Casing
#4 exhibits a higher ?P associated with a higher Redp.

The blow-averaged pumping power as a function of Redp is shown in

Fig. 5.13. As expected, for a given Redp, the highest values of W? pump
are related to the smaller particle diameters. Comparing the differ-
ent regenerator housings for a constant sphere diameter, the following
considerations can be made:

1. For Casings #1, #2 and #3, if the mass flow rate is the same, then
Redp is also the same, but the utilization is different. This means

that W? pump only changes with ?P . In this situation, Casing #3

presented the highest W? pump because of its longer regenerator
length;

2. Comparing Casings #3 and #4: (i) for a fixed Redp, Casing #3

has a higher W? pump because of the higher mass flow rate. For
example, for a particle diameter of 0.5 mm and Redp = 40, both
casings have a ?P of about 50 kPa. However, since Casing #3

operates with a higher mass flow rate, it has a higher W? pump; (ii)
for identical operating, i.e., displaced volume and operating fre-

quency, Casing #4 has a clearly higher W? pump due to the higher
?P and Redp.

Figure 5.14 – Casing #1: ? as a function of NTU for different values
of sphere size and utilization.

Regarding the experimental NTU ranges, the following remarks can be
made:

1. For a fixed utilization, considering different sphere sizes, the NTU
range is longest for the smallest sphere diameter because of the
largest interstitial heat transfer area;

2. For a fixed particle size and a fixed utilization, the NTU decreases
with the increasing mass flow rate. The higher values of NTU
are for the lower operating frequencies, which for a constant uti-
lization means a lower mass flow rate. In other words, increasing
the operating frequency decreases the NTU;

Figure 5.16 – Casing #3: ? as a function of NTU for different values
of sphere size and utilization.

As far as the thermal effectiveness results are concerned, the following
comments can be made:

1. For a fixed utilization and different sphere sizes, the effectiveness
improves for the smaller particle diameters, which is associated
with the larger heat transfer surface area and NTU. Thus, 0.5-
mm sphere matrices presented the highest ?-NTU combinations,
with the effectiveness approaching 98% to 99%;

2. For a fixed particle size and different utilizations, the effectiveness
range decreases with increasing utilization due to a reduction of
the NTU;

Figure 5.17 – Casing #4: ? as a function of NTU for different values
of sphere size and utilization.

3. For a fixed particle size and a fixed utilization, in general, the
effectiveness increases with increasing NTU;

4. For small utilizations the effectiveness may not increase with the
NTU due to the influence of axial heat conduction. In these
cases, the low mass flow rate - resulting from a small pumped
volumes and low frequencies - gives rise to low superficial ve-
locities that result in small interstitial heat transfer coefficients.
Thus, the interphase convection and axial conduction heat fluxes
are comparable in magnitude, reducing the effectiveness associ-
ated with the regenerator and even increasing the NTU. This is
more visible for the smallest sphere diameter, 0.5 mm, for which



170 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

the effectiveness is approximately constant or decreases as NTU
increases. For the 1-mm spheres, the effectiveness first increases
with the NTU, but later decreases, as the axial heat conduction
becomes more important. In addition, the effect of axial heat con-
duction is more noticeable as the casing length becomes shorter,
like in Casing #1.

5. The differentiation between the effectivenesses related to the three
sphere sizes becomes more evident at low utilizations and larger
values of NTU. As the NTU decreases, the results for the three
sphere sizes tend to converge into a single ?-NTU curve, but the
0.5-mm spheres always have higher ?-NTU values when compared
with the other particle diameters.

In an evaluation specifically for the smallest pumped volume (2.53 cm3),
which corresponded to the smallest utilization for each casing, the fol-
lowing effectiveness ranges were found:

? Casing#1: ? ? 0.23 ? 94.5% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;97.5%;

? Casing#2: ? ? 0.15 ? 96.5% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;98.5%;

? Casing#3: ? ? 0.11 ? 97% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;98.5%;

? Casing#4: ? ? 0.26 ? 95.5% &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;97.5%;

For Casings #1, #2 and #3, the superficial velocity and Redp are
the same for a given particle diameter. In this case, the differences
in effectiveness are related to the different utilization values for the
three matrices. Also, the shorter matrices are more susceptible to axial
heat conduction losses. Nevertheless, the effectiveness values are of
the same order, but the shorter matrices have lower viscous losses.
Comparing Casings #1 and #4, the ?-NTU and the utilization ranges
are approximately the same. However, in Casing #4 the axial heat
conduction is less important, but the viscous losses are higher than in
Casing #1.

5.3.3.3 Effectiveness: Effect of Regenerator Housing Dimen-
sions

Figs. 5.18 to 5.20 show the effectiveness as a function of NTU for the
different regenerator housings considering nearly constant utilizations,
for the sphere diameters of 0.5, 0.8 and 1 mm, respectively. In this case,
to fix the utilization, different fluid volumes were pumped considering
the different regenerator sizes. For example, for ? ? 0.23, in Casings
#1 and #4, the displaced volume was 2.53 cm3, while for Casings
#2 and #3 it was 3.80 cm3 and 5.07 cm3, respectively. Hence, for the
smaller regenerators, in terms of the total matrix mass, always a smaller
amount of fluid was displaced to achieve about the same utilization.

Figure 5.19 – dp = 0.8 mm: ? as a function of NTU for different
regenerator casings.

In an ideal regenerator, for a fixed utilization and independently of the
housing size, the results would lead to the same ?-NTU curve. How-
ever, when losses are taken into account, a more in-depth evaluation is
required to understand the differences between the regenerators:

1. Casing #1 always presented the smallest effectiveness values be-
cause of: (i) the axial conduction losses, that become more pro-
nounced for the smaller particle diameters and utilizations; (ii)
its smaller NTU given that this casing has the smallest total heat
transfer area;



5.3 Experimental Results 173

2. Casing#2, #3 and #4, presented very similar results. Only for
the smallest utilization, Casing #4 indicated some significant ax-
ial conduction losses associated for the smaller spheres sizes (0.5
and 0.8 mm).

5.3.3.4 General Conclusions About the Packed Bed Regen-
erators

The results presented in this section for: (i) identical regenerator hous-
ing and different spheres sizes and (ii) identical sphere size and different
housing dimensions, lead to the following conclusions:

1. All matrices presented exhibited high values of effectiveness, which
is a typical feature of oscillating flow packed bed regenerators
(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997). The smallest
values were found for Casing #1 with a sphere diameter of 1 mm
and ? ? 1.25;

2. Smaller particle diameters are associated with the highest ?-NTU
values, but are more susceptible to axial heat conduction losses
at small utilizations, and higher viscous losses at high flow rates;

3. The smallest aspect ratio regenerator housing, Casing #1, for a
fixed utilization, was the least effective matrix, but presented the
lowest viscous losses;

4. Casing #4, the highest aspect ratio matrix, was directly com-
pared with Casings #2 and #3. However, no significant effec-
tiveness improvement was verified. Additionally, Casing #4 was
the worst casing in terms of viscous losses;

5. Casings #2 and #3 were the most thermally effective matrices,
showing a very good agreement with each other at the highest
values of ?-NTU for a fixed utilization. However, Casing #2 pre-
sented lower viscous losses than Casing #3 because of its shorter
length.

In conclusion, with regard to the thermal effectiveness, axial conduc-
tion and viscous losses, high aspect ratio regenerators do not seem to
be the best configuration. On the other hand, too short regenerators
may increase the axial conduction losses and are associated with the
smallest NTU ranges. Moreover, there seems to be an optimal rela-
tionship between dp, Dh,reg and LReg for a given operating condition
dictated by the mass flow rate and frequency, that guarantees a high
effectiveness with minimal axial heat conduction and viscous losses, as
will be discussed later.

5.3.4 Pins, Plates and Spheres: A Regenerative
Matrix Comparison

Fig. 5.21 shows the pressure drop and pumping power associated with
the different passive matrix geometries presented in Table 3.8. As dis-
cussed previously, the different matrices were designed to have approx-
imately the same particle diameter and porosity so that the porous me-
dium hydraulic diameter and the heat transfer area are approximately
the same for all geometries. The following remarks can be made about
the results shown in Fig. 5.21:

1. At low Reynolds number, in the viscous (Darcian) regime, the
differences in pressure drop or pumping power among the three
geometries are minimal;

2. As expected, the plates present a linear pressure drop as a func-
tion of the Reynolds number, characteristic of the Darcian flow
regime;

3. The packed bed of spheres shows the highest viscous losses, es-
pecially at higher velocities, where the microscopic inertial forces
become more significant;

4. The pressure drop of the pin array also presents a quadratic
dependence on the Reynolds number, however, it is clear that
the microscopic inertial force is weaker when compared with the
packed bed of spheres;

5. For the pumping power, at the same Redp, the parallel plate
regenerator has the lowest viscous losses, while the bed of spheres
shows the worst pumping power performance among the three
geometries.

Fig. 5.22 shows the behavior of ? as a function of NTU and utilization
for the three matrix geometries. Based on these results, the following
conclusions can be drawn:

1. Since the total heat transfer area is approximately the same for
all geometries, for a given mass flow rate, the NTU depends only
on the interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient;

Figure 5.22 – ? as a function of NTU and utilization for different re-
generator geometries.

2. At the smallest values of utilization: (i) the parallel plate geome-
try encompasses a broader range of NTU because its convective
heat transfer coefficient is constant (disregarding the entrance ef-
fects) and, at some operating conditions, is higher than the con-
vective coefficient of the remaining geometries; (ii) the pin array
matrix exhibited a slightly higher effectiveness, which can be asso-
ciated with the smaller axial heat conduction losses characteristic
of this matrix. It is worth pointing out that there is no point of
contact between adjacent pins, which reduces the importance of

heat conduction in the matrix;

3. For intermediate values of utilization, the thermal performance
of all matrices is very similar, especially for NTU &gt; 25, which
corresponds to the smallest mass flow rates or superficial veloc-
ities. Considering the same operating conditions, the values of
NTU for the parallel plate geometry cover wider ranges for each
utilization, but these ranges decrease faster than in the other
geometries, due to the approximately constant convection heat
transfer coefficient;

4. At the highest values of utilization, the thermal performance of
the packed bed of spheres is better than that of the other ge-
ometries. The parallel plates showed the worst performance at
these operating conditions. This may be associated with the high
interstitial heat transfer coefficients for pins and spheres, and to
the fluid mixing due induced by the tortuosity of the packed bed.

With regard to the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the different matrix
geometries, it can be concluded that, at the smallest flow rates, where
the viscous losses are similar for all matrices, the pin array showed the
best performance since it is less affected by axial heat conduction. On
the other hand, all geometries presented, in general, equivalent thermal
performances (?-NTU), with the parallel plates being characterized
by the smallest viscous losses. For the highest values of utilization,
the packed spheres showed the best thermal performance, but at the
expense of the highest values of pressure drop and pumping power.

size and regenerator dimensions, i.e., length and diameter, was repro-
duced satisfactorily by the model, which leads to the conclusion that
the closure relationships for the permeability and constant proposed by
(ERGUN, 1952) are valid for the present experimental conditions.

Other important conclusions can be drawn regarding the friction factor.
If the permeability and Ergun constant are valid for the regenerative
matrix, the friction factor should depend only on Redp, independently
of the particle diameter, housing dimensions or operating condition.

Figure 5.24 – Comparison between the numerical results and the ex-
perimental data: fD as a function of Redp for packed beds of spheres.

The fD as a function of Redp experimental data exhibited the expected
trend: (i) all the results collapsed into a single curve; (ii) as explained
before, at low Redp, where Darcy’s law is valid, a linear trend is ob-
served; (iii) as Redp increases, the fD trend deviates from the linear
behavior. The numerical prediction is in a good agreement with the
experimental results.

Figs. 5.25 to 5.33 compare the numerical results and experimental data

presented for two situations: (i) considering the existence of the void
volume - solid blue lines; (ii) disregarding the void volume - dotted
black lines. The caption of each figure describes the conditions of the

Firstly, the discussion will be based on the results for Casings #1, #2
and #3. Casing #4 followed basically the same general trends of the
other casings. However, its results, particularly for dp = 0.8 mm, will be
discussed later, in the context of a direct comparison with the parallel
plate and pin array geometries.

The simulations that did not take the void volume model into account
always overestimated the experimental results. On the other hand, the
simulations that considered this type of leakage loss were in much bet-
ter agreement with the experimental data. In particular, the following
comments can be made: (i) for all cases, the experimental and numer-
ical ?-NTU results presented the same trend; (ii) The model was able
to reproduce the sensitivity of the experimental data with respect to
the sphere size and housing dimensions; (iii) the differences between
the simulations with and without the void volumes are greater at small
values of utilization (small pumped volumes). This was somewhat ex-
pected, since a considerable fraction of the pumped volume becomes
trapped in the void space. As the displaced volume is increased, this
fraction is reduced and the penalties associated with the void volume
become less important.

For a more specific evaluation, Fig. 5.34 shows comparisons between the
experimental and numerical time-dependent temperature results with
(? 6= 0) and without (? = 0) the void volumes evaluated at the cold
and hot ends. The results are for Casing #3, dp = 0.8 mm, ? ? 0.467
and different operating frequencies.

When no void volume is considered, the model predicts that the re-
turning fluid stream will be at the reservoir temperature followed by
an abrupt variation of the temperature signal. In the case of the hot
end, if t? &gt; ? the inlet stream is at 320 K. This is different from the
actual experimental temperature measurement shown in Fig. 5.34. On
the other hand, when the void volume is considered, the returning fluid
stream is firstly at the temperature of the fluid trapped in the void
space and, only later, at the reservoir temperature. The fluid trapped
in the hot-side void volume is at a temperature lower than that of the
hot reservoir because it does not interact thermally with the reservoir.
Thus, the time-dependent temperature signal from the model includ-
ing the void volumes deviates from the zero void volume results, and
a larger amplitude of the temperature signal is observed, which results
in a lower thermal effectiveness. This behavior of the mathematical
model agrees well with the experimental measurements and confirms

the suitability of the numerical modeling of the void volume, for de-
scribing with good precision the actual behavior of the time-dependent
temperature and the thermal effectiveness in real regenerators.

Fig. 5.35 presents comparisons between the experimental and numerical
(with void volume) time-dependent temperatures at the hot end as a
function of the utilization. As can be seen, the model does a good job
at predicting the experimental data for the high values of utilization.
However, the model under-predicts the temperatures for the lowest
utilizations (0.11 and 0.23). It is believed that this underestimation of
the experimental results can be caused by the no flow period associated
with the small pumped volumes. As seen in Fig. 5.6(c), the no flow
period was significant for the flow conditions.

high values of utilization with deviations of the order of 1%. For low
utilizations, the deviations were as large as 2%, but still below the
experimental uncertainty range.

Figs. 5.36 to 5.40 show the axial temperature profiles (as a function
of the dimensionless length, z?) after the cold blow (solid symbols)
and after hot blow (open symbols), for different regenerator housing
dimensions and spheres sizes. In each figure, different utilizations are
presented considering a single value of frequency (fixed at 0.5 Hz). The
different conditions related to each figure are presented in their cap-
tions. In general, the model captures the sensitivity of the temperature
profiles with respect to the experimental parameters for all cases, just
with some local deviations. At low utilizations, the temperature pro-
files follow almost linear trends, while for higher values of utilization,
a significant penetration of the constant temperature of the reservoirs
into the matrix is observed. In this case, it is important to highlight
that the model captures with a good precision the constant temperature
penetration region, including the position of the thermal front.

5.4.2 Pin, Plate and Sphere Matrices

Fig. 5.41 presents a comparison between the experimental and numeri-
cal results for ?P as a function of Redp. Fig. 5.42 shows the results for
fD as a function of Redp for the three different regenerator geometries:
0.8-mm spheres, parallel plates and pin arrays.

The numerical results show a generally good agreement with the exper-
imental data. Regarding the spheres and pin array matrices, the model
captured the very similar behavior of these two geometries: (i) at low
Redp, Darcy regime, the ?P and fD for the pins are both sightly higher
than those for the bed of spheres, which can be due to the lower perme-
ability of the pins porous medium. (ii) at high Redp, the microscopic
inertial force of the pin array is weaker compared with that of the bed
of spheres. This way, the suitability of the closure relationships for the
permeability and Ergun constant for parallel plates and pin arrays is
also verified.

Figure 5.42 – Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-

Figs. 5.43 to 5.45 show comparisons between the numerical model and
the experimental data for ? as a function of NTU and utilization for
the three basic geometries (0.8-mm spheres, plates and pins).

As expected, the numerical results for the packed spheres presented
a good agreement with the experimental data. The model also rep-
resented fairly well the effectiveness results for the parallel plate and
pin matrices. The following general comments can be made: (i) for
low utilizations the numerical results underestimated the experimental
data, which can be associated with the no flow period, but the general
trend of the ?-NTU relationship is picked up by the model; (ii) as the
utilization increases, the model describes well the experimental values
and the ?-NTU curve trend. On the other hand, for the largest values
of the utilization, the model for plates and pins overestimates the ex-
perimental data. In summary, the majority of modeling results agreed
fairly well with the experimental data, with deviations of the order of
2 to 3% for the lowest and highest utilization values.



198 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators

The good agreement between the experimental data and numerical re-
sults leads to the following conclusions: (i) the parallel plates and pin
arrays were successfully assembled based on the procedure presented
in Appendix B, and flow maldistribution, common in parallel plate ge-
ometries, was not verified; (ii) the model may have some limitations
at high mass flow rates and high utilizations; (iii) but the closure re-
lations used for parallel plates and pin arrays seemed to have been
satisfactorily selected.

5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistribution 201

5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistri-
bution

The presence of a void volume imposes changes on the boundary condi-
tions for the thermal balance in the regenerator matrix that are respon-
sible for decreasing the heat transfer effectiveness. Hence, it becomes
intuitive that the regenerator performance improves as the void volume
becomes smaller and, in a limiting situation, a regenerator without void
volumes will have the best performance. Fig. 5.46 shows the numerical
results for ? as a function of NTU for Casing #1 with 1-mm spheres and
different void volumes fractions, as presented in Tab. 3.6. The numeri-
cal results somehow reproduced the expected behavior: (i) by decreas-
ing the void volume size the effectiveness has improved, approaching
the results for the zero void volume regenerator; (ii) by increasing the
utilization, the void volume impact is reduced because the fraction of
the total pumped volume trapped in the void space becomes smaller.

In order to characterize experimentally the results shown in Fig. 5.46,
experimental tests were performed using the same porous matrix, but
changing the R-T adapter to decrease the void volume size, as presented
in Fig. 3.18 and Table 3.6. 1-mm spheres were used in the tests carried
out using Casings #1, #2 and #3. The results for ? as a function of
NTU for these casings are presented in Figs. 5.47 to 5.49.

Considering the same regenerator housing used in the numerical model,
Fig. 5.46, the experimental results shown in Fig. 5.47 exhibit an oppo-
site behavior, i.e., by decreasing the void volume size, the regenerator
effectiveness is reduced. The same behavior was observed in Casing
#2. In Casing #3, the effectiveness reduction was smaller, but defi-
nitely no improvement of the effectiveness was observed, as predicted
by the model.

The reduction of the regenerator effectiveness can be explained by a
maldistribution of the inlet flow through the regenerator. When the
void volume is reduced, the diverging angle of the inlet R-T adapter
becomes smaller, approaching the shape of a sudden expansion. Thus,
with the abrupt variation in cross sectional area, like in R-T Adapter
#3, an abrupt change in average flow velocity is produced. As a result,
a flow recirculation region is created inside the matrix, near the inlet.
The fluid in this recirculation region does not interact effectively with
the inlet stream, which acts as an internal void space that reduces the

total heat transfer area and the effective thermal mass of the matrix. As
a result, the heat transfer effectiveness decreases. Also, the void region
creates internal gradients in the transverse direction. The 1-D model
approach is not capable of simulating these losses because they involve
two-dimensional effects related to the fluid flow and heat transfer.

The inlet flow maldistribution imposes heavier penalties on shorter ma-
trices, such as Casing #1, as the length fraction of the recirculation
region is larger. In longer matrices, such as Casing #3, the influence of
the flow maldistribution is smaller, as can be seen in Fig. 5.49. How-
ever, this was not sufficient to improve the performance in comparison
with a regenerator with a larger void volume.

There still remains the question about what the results would be if a
zero void volume regenerator was evaluated. Lozano (2015) proposed
a regenerator housing with a round rectangular cross sectional area,
in which the inlet and outlet streams are different, as can be seen in
Fig. 3.19. This geometry guarantees a zero void volume but the inlet
flow tubing is similar to R-T Adapter #3. Using this casing geometry
(Casing #7), two different packed bed matrices were characterized ex-
perimentally, one with 0.5 and another with 1 mm spheres. The results
for the two spheres are presented in Figs. 5.50 and 5.51, respectively.
The experimental results are compared with the numerical model con-
sidering a zero void volume. Fig. 5.52 presents the experimental results
for ?P as a function of Redp for Casing #7 and a comparison with the
numerical model.

As can be seen in Figs. 5.50 and 5.51, there are considerable differences,
as high as 7%, between the numerical and experimental effectiveness
results. These discrepancies in the thermal effectiveness can also be at-
tributed to the inlet flow maldistribution. The design of Casing #7 gave
rise to recirculation regions near the flow inlet, creating a large ther-
mally inactive region, which reduced the effective heat transfer area,
also creating internal temperature gradients transversal to the flow di-
rection. In addition, due to the two-dimensional nature of the flow,
the one-dimensional momentum equation does not adequately repre-
sent this regenerator configuration. As a result, the variation of ?P
with Redp was under-predicted by the model. In summary, the design
geometry chosen for Casing #7, albeit having a zero void volume, dete-
riorated the regenerator thermal performance and increased the viscous
losses.

6 Active Magnetic
Regenerators

The present chapter discusses the experimental and numerical evalua-
tions of active magnetic regenerators, starting with some preliminary
results, for which the influence of the ambient and magnet temper-
ature on the regenerator temperature span is quantified. Next, the
time-dependent measurements, the performance metrics and the uncer-
tainty analysis required for the data regression are presented. Later,
the results for the AMR performance metrics are discussed based on
experimental results for a sphere packed bed matrix. The experimen-
tal data are compared with the numerical results, where the different
types of losses are identified. Finally, comparisons are made between
the parallel plate, pin array and packed bed geometries based on the
performance metrics for AMRs.

6.1 Preliminary Tests

Before starting the description of the main results and the evaluation
of the AMR performance, a preliminary experimental characterization
was carried out. In these tests, the cold side of the AMR apparatus
was modified (see Fig. 3.4), in which the entire cold side instrumen-
tation, including the pressure transducers, mass flow meter, cold heat
exchanger and heater, was replaced by a single tube in which only tem-
perature readings were performed. The single tube linked directly the
cold end of the regenerator to the double effect pump. Thus, the fluid
that exits the cold end of the regenerator during the hot blow is trapped
in the tubing and returns to the regenerator in the cold blow. In other
words, the single tubing acts as a void volume.



210 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

In the preliminary tests, no thermal load is applied (zero load condi-
tion), so the maximum regenerator temperature span is achieved at
each particular operating condition. Fig. 6.1 shows a typical tempera-
ture measurement obtained in a preliminary test.

AMR preliminary tests.

The no-load tests were performed for different temperatures of the hot
reservoir, between 290 K and 315 K, in steps of 5 K. The results of
the preliminary tests are presented in terms of ?TReg as a function of
TH for two different frequencies: 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, as shown in Fig. 6.2.
The experiments were performed at the ambient temperatures, TAmb,
of 293 and 300 K. In all tests, after setting the temperature of the
room, the measurements started only after 24 hours to ensure thermal
equilibrium between the magnetic circuit and the ambient.

The results presented in Fig. 6.2 in general agreed with those by other
authors (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al., 2014). Based on the pre-
liminary no-load tests, the following remarks can be made:

212 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

1. In Fig. 6.1, the outlet temperature at the cold end, TC, has a large
amplitude as a result of the single tubing acting as void volume.
As discussed in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 the void volumes impose
variable temperature boundary conditions at the regenerator ends
that, in the case of the zero load AMR tests, are not strictly
adiabatic due to the thermal interaction of the void volume with
the ambient at the cold end;

2. Due to a less effective thermal insulation of the active regenera-
tors, the ambient and the magnetic circuit temperatures have a
significant influence on ?TReg. This influence can be understood
as a parasitic heat gain, or a parasitic heat loss, depending on the
temperatures of the hot and cold ends of the regenerator;

3. Considering the axial temperature profile in the regenerator, the
region along which the temperature inside the regenerator is be-
low the magnetic circuit temperature experiences a heat gain.
Conversely, the region along which the temperature is above the
magnetic circuit temperature experiences a heat loss. If the heat
gain surpasses the heat loss, the magnetic circuit acts toward re-
ducing ?TReg. Otherwise, if the heat loss wins, the magnetic
circuit helps to cool down the matrix, increasing ?TReg;

4. For the conditions in Fig. 6.2, as TH is increased, ?TReg becomes
larger for two different reasons: (i) the decrease with temperature
of the (negative) adiabatic temperature change for demagnetiza-
tion (MCE), which reaches a minimum coming from the ferro-
magnetic phase at around 295 K, and increases at a slower rate
for higher temperatures, in the paramagnetic phase (TREVIZOLI
et al., 2011); (ii) the change from a net heat gain case (considering
the whole length of the regenerator), to a net heat loss case, as
the length of the heat gain region is reduced and TC approaches
TAmb.

Therefore, to perform experiments that truly evaluate the AMR per-
formance, it is important to avoid conditions in which the heat loss to
magnetic circuit “improve” the regenerator performance. Therefore, in
all experimental tests, the following temperature equilibrium condition
will be considered: TH = TAmb = TMag. This condition is one of heat
gain, which deteriorates the AMR performance, but is more realistic
from the point of view of a real magnetic cooling application. Finally,
as in the passive regenerator experiments, the temperature equilibrium



6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements 213

condition was such that TH = TAmb = 300 K in all experiments pre-
sented in this thesis.

6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements

The time-dependent measurements performed by the different trans-
ducers were used in the calculation of the time-average values needed
to compute the performance metrics. The same instrumentation and
DAQ used in the passive experiments were used in the AMR tests. Also,
the same strategy to evaluate the time-average variables was applied,
in which 300 experimental points per cycle and a total of five cycles are
considered in the calculations. The time-dependent measurements are
explained next.

6.2.1 Temperature Measurements

An AMR test starts with a zero thermal load applied on the heater.
The temperatures of the hot reservoir and of the ambient were kept
at 300 K (temperature equilibrium condition). As the test progresses,
the temperature at the cold end of the regenerator, TCE, decreases and
the compensation temperatures, TCH-out and THeater-in, are adjusted
so as to match the time-average temperature of the fluid that exits
the regenerator at the cold end, T CE. When this condition is reached
(with a safety margin of +0.1 K), the periodically developed regime is
assumed and the data are saved considering 300 points per cycle. In the
following test, the heater is turned on and, again, TCH-out and THeater-in
are adjusted to match the new T CE temperature, and a new periodically
developed condition is established. This procedure was repeated until
the maximum thermal load condition, at which ?THex = TH ? TC ?
0. Fig. 6.3 shows the five cycles of the time-dependent temperature
measurements during the periodically developed regime for different
thermal loads, considering the operating condition of f = 0.5 Hz and
? ? 0.41.

Some remarks are in order regarding the experimental procedure:

? The objective of the temperature compensation is to find the
condition at which TCH-out = THeater-in = T CE. During a test,
two different situations can occur while the bath temperature

is adjusted: (i) if THeater-in (and TCH-out) is greater than T CE,
the temperature of the thermal bath has to be reduced; (ii) if
THeater-in (and TCH-out) is lower than T CE, the temperature of
the bath has to be raised. To perform a reliable characterization,
if situation (i) exists, then the thermal bath is adding some heat
to the regenerator, which can be interpreted as an additional
thermal load. On the other hand, if situation (ii) is verified,
then the thermal bath is artificially increasing the AMR cooling
capacity, what is not physically consistent with the actual AMR
performance. To avoid the situation (ii) a safety margin of +0.1
K was included in the temperature compensation. In this case,
the safety margin of +0.1 K represents an additional heat input



6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements 215

that has to be included in the experimental procedure to calculate
the cooling capacity that will be explained in Section 6.3;

? In the tests where the heater is turned off, because of the tem-
perature safety margin and mainly due to the heat gain from the
ambient through the cold side tubing, the zero thermal load con-
dition is never truly satisfied. For example, in Fig. 6.3 for the
test in which the heater was switched off, ?THex and the cool-
ing capacity were calculated at 28 K and 3.61 W, respectively,
which can be attributed mainly to the heat gain from the ambi-
ent. In this case, the ambient temperature was 300 K and TC was
approximately 272 K. Clearly, the higher ?THex, the higher the
heat gain from the ambient;

? In Fig. 6.3, there is an indication of the void volume impact on the
time-dependent temperature measurements. In the AMR tests
the void volume plays the same role as in the passive regenerators.
Its impact on the AMR performance will be discussed in Section
6.5.2.

6.2.2 Torque Measurements

Fig. 6.4 shows the last five cycles of the time-dependent total torque
measurements. Fig. 6.4(a) presents the results for different values of
?THex, considering f = 0.5 Hz and ? ? 0.41, as in Fig. 6.3. Fig. 6.4(b)
presents the results for different utilizations, considering f = 0.5 Hz
and ?THex = 0. The results resemble a sinusoidal waveform, with su-
perposed high frequency oscillations that are related to the magnetic
circuit torque contribution. The magnetic circuit torque characteriza-
tion is discussed in greater detail in Appendix A.

Since the magnetic circuit and the pumping system are driven by a
single motor, the total torque is a combination of four different contri-
butions: (i) the torque of the magnetic circuit without the regenerator
(see Appendix A), (ii) the pumping system torque, (iii) the magnetic
interaction torque and (iv) the torque associated with the mechanical
losses. The magnetic interaction torque is the reversible part of the
torque, which can be positive or negative depending on the magnetic
attraction. The positive values are related to the torque necessary to
remove the magnetic field from the regenerator bed, which corresponds
to the demagnetization process. On the other hand, the negative part

is related to the application of the magnetic field on the regenerator
bed during the magnetization process. The pumping torque is an ir-
reversible contribution, i.e., always positive. As a result, the positive
peaks and the negative valleys of the total torque are not symmetric.

In Fig. 6.4(a), since the utilization and frequency are constant, the
increase in the total torque is just related to the increasing ?THex.
As ?THex becomes higher, the temperature of the cold reservoir is
reduced. For a fixed hot reservoir temperature, the fraction of the
regenerator that is in the ferromagnetic phase increases. This increases
the magnetic attraction and the torque necessary to rotate the magnet
becomes higher. Also, but to a lower extent, the pumping system
torque also increases as the working fluid becomes more viscous due
to the temperature reduction. Fig. 6.4(b) shows the influence of the
pumping system torque, considering ?THex = 0. In this case, the
magnetic interaction torque is the same for all utilizations. As the
utilization is increased, the total torque becomes higher because of the
viscous losses.

6.2.3 Influence of the Oscillating Torque on the
Pressure Drop and Mass Flow Rate

The drivers for the pumping system and magnetic circuit are linked
by the bevel gear boxes and are driven by the same stepper motor.
As a result, the oscillating torque from the magnetic circuit interferes
with the flow velocity. Fig. 6.5 shows the influence of the oscillating
torque on the instantaneous mass flow rate (for PP#122.5 and sk =
10 mm), and on the instantaneous total pressure drop (for PP#122.5
and sk = 10 and 20 mm), respectively. The measurements performed
in AMRs are compared with those carried out in passive regenerators.
The differences in mass flow rate and pressure drop can be attributed
to the oscillating torque and to the fluid properties, since the water-
glycol mixture is more dense and more viscous than pure water and,
hence, the peak of the mass flow rate and pressure drop are higher for
the AMRs.

The instantaneous mass flow rate, Fig. 6.5(a), is less sensitive to the
torque oscillations due to the second-order measurement effects (time
constant) of the Coriolis mass flow meters, but some influences are
visible and indicated by the arrows. The impact on the instantaneous
pressure drop is more visible, indicating some significant variations of

the instantaneous flow velocity. Also, the variations in flow velocity are
not perfectly symmetric.

It is important to mention that, although the instantaneous velocities in
the hot and cold blows are not symmetric, in terms of the cycle-average
values, the AMR still operates under balanced flow conditions, as the
amount of pumped fluid (and the utilization factor) is fixed for both
blows. The blow period did not present significant variations either
(lower than 5%). Despite the variation in the instantaneous value, the
time-average mass flow rate is still in good agreement with the reference
value, as explained in Section 5.1.2. Thus, the time-average value will
be used in the performance metrics analysis explained next.

6.3 Performance Metrics and Data Regres-
sion

The AMR performance metrics are related to the cycle-average cooling
capacity and the total cycle-average power input to drive the magnetic
circuit and pumping system. Fig. 6.6 shows a schematic representation
of the main variables of a generic magnetic refrigerator.

Based on the schematic diagram in Fig. 6.6 there are finite temperature
differences associated with the hot, ?TH, and cold, ?TC, reservoirs.
These temperature differences are necessary due to finite heat transfer
areas in each heat exchanger, which make their thermal effectiveness
lower than unity. The temperature differences in the figure are defined
as follows:

?TC = TC ?T CE (6.1)

?TH = TH ?T HE (6.2)

?THex = TH ?TC (6.3)

?TReg = T HE ?T CE (6.4)

where ?TReg is the regenerator temperature span, which is always

THR-in is the temperature read by the probe located between the hot
heat exchanger and the hot regenerator end and, similarly THeater-out
is the temperature read by the probe located at the heater end and
assumed as the cold reservoir temperature (see Fig. 3.4). The inte-
grations were performed numerically using the extended Simpson rule
(Eq. (5.10)). Fig. 6.7 shows the time-dependent temperature measure-
ments of TH, TC, THE and TCE for two different situations: (i) an in-
termediate thermal load test, Fig. 6.7(a), and (ii) a maximum thermal
load test, Fig. 6.7(b).

The intermediate thermal load test situation is associated with a spe-
cific operating condition characterized by positive (non-zero) values of
cooling capacity and ?THex. The maximum load test, on the other
hand, is defined by ?THex = 0 and ?TReg &gt; 0. In this case, if
?TReg = 0 is considered for the condition of maximum cooling capacity,
there will be a thermodynamic inconsistency regarding the operation of
the refrigeration system, as the temperatures of the thermal reservoirs
will be inverted, i.e., TH &amp;lt;TC.

The instantaneous cooling capacity, Q?C, is calculated by:

Q?C = m?(t)cp,f(TC ?TCE(t)) (6.9)

culate ?TReg, considering a single cycle. ?THex is used directly as the
temperature boundary conditions of the numerical simulation. How-
ever, due to the existence of oscillating torque and second-order effects
in the Coriolis mass flow meter, the experimental determination of m?(t)
may be subjected to a few inconsistencies at some conditions. To elimi-
nate this problem, the experimental cycle-average cooling capacity was
calculated by:

Q?C =
1

2
m?cp,f(TC ?T CE) (6.11)

where m? is the reference mass flow rate, TC is given by Eq. (6.8) and
T CE by Eq. (6.6). The factor (1/2) accounts for the discontinuity of
the cycle, i.e., the hot blow period is half the total period.

The experimental evaluation of Q?C proposed in this thesis is differ-
ent from those usually encountered in the literature (KITANOVSKI et
al., 2015). Generally, the electrical heater power is used to emulate a
thermal load. However, since one of the main objectives of the exper-
imental analysis is to compare and validate the numerical model, the
use of Eq. (6.11) is more appropriate, since the calculation is based on
the same parameters (m? and TCE) derived from the numerical results
(Eq. (6.10)). The main advantage of this procedure is that Eq. (6.11)
returns the ‘actual cooling potential’ of the AMR, which takes into ac-
count all the thermal loads imposed on the regenerator, including the
electrical heater power input and the heat gain from external sources,
such as the ambient and the safety margin used in the cold heat ex-
changer temperature compensation explained previously.

On the other hand, this kind of experimental evaluation is more suscep-
tible to experimental uncertainties, as will be explained in more details
and quantified in the next section. Because of this, an additional eval-

uation of Q?C was performed and used to verify the consistency of the
calculation. Thus:

Q?C,ver = m?cp,f(THeater-out ?T Heater-in) (6.12)

where Q?C,ver is the heat load applied by the heater, which includes
the Joule heating by the electrical heater and the heat gain from the
ambient through the heater control volume.

The cycle-average total power, W? , needed to perform the magnetic flux
density variation and the oscillating fluid flow is calculated by:

W? = 2?fM? (6.13)

where ? is the cycle-average total torque and fM is the stepper mo-
tor frequency, which is half the AMR operating frequency. As ex-
plained previously, the instantaneous torque measurement, ?(t), al-
ready accounts for four torque contributions, namely the magnetic cir-
cuit torque, the pumping torque, magnetic interaction torque and me-
chanical losses. ? is calculated by:

6.3.1 Uncertainty Analysis

The experimental uncertainties related to the AMR performance met-
rics were evaluated according to the methodology presented in Section



6.3 Performance Metrics and Data Regression 225

5.2.1. Eqs. (5.11), (5.14) and (5.16) were used to compute the combined
and the expanded uncertainties. The values of the calculated expanded
uncertainties are described together with the results.

Regarding the uncertainties of the cycle-average cooling capacity and,

consequently, the COP and the second-law efficiency, Q?C is calculated
based on the temperature difference between the time-average temper-

atures TC and T CE (?TC = TC ?T CE). Depending on the value of Q?C
and m?, the absolute value of the temperature difference ?TC can be of
the order of the experimental uncertainty of ?TC. The uncertainty as-
sociated with ?TC is approximately 0.3 K. As a result, the uncertainty

evaluated for Q?C is on same order of the absolute value of Q?C.

However, the points mentioned below ensure that the proposed exper-

imental evaluation of Q?C is robust and reliable:

1. All experimental tests were performed using the same calibrated
temperature probes. The calibration procedure, described in
Chapter 3, was carefully performed and utilized a recently cal-
ibrated standard thermometer;

2. The assembly and measurements with the temperature probes
were performed following the procedure developed for the passive
regenerators, which was demonstrated to be physically consistent
through comparisons with the numerical model. Based on this
previous experience, one can ensure that the temperature mea-
surements in the AMR were successfully performed;

3. Although the absolute value of ?TC is of the order of 0.3 K, the
time-dependent measurement of TCE presented a continuous be-
havior with an amplitude always larger than 0.5 K. In addition, a
very good reproducibility was observed considering the five cycles
used in the calculation of the average temperature values. This
means a small standard deviation for the five cycles;

4. In all experimental results presented in this thesis, the differences

between Q?C and Q?C,ver were smaller than the related uncertain-

ties, with Q?C always slightly larger than Q?C,ver. This is justified
by the temperature safety margin used in the cold heat exchanger
temperature compensation.

6.4 Reproducibility of the Experimental
Results

As in the passive regenerator experimental characterization, the first
evaluation of the AMR performance focuses on the experimental repro-
ducibility of the results. These experimental tests were repeated three
times by three different operators (PVT, ATN and GFP). The Spheres
#3 geometry (see Table 3.9) were used as the regenerative matrix. As-
sembly #1 was evaluated first by operator PVT. Later, Assemblies #2
and #3 were tested by operators ATN and GFP, respectively, following
the same procedure used by PVT.

Fig. 6.8 shows the reproducibility of the results for Q?C as a function
of ?THex considering three different operating conditions: (i) ? ? 0.41
and f = 0.25 Hz, (ii) ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.5 Hz, (iii) ? ? 1.23 and f =
0.25 Hz. The results showed a very good reproducibility, with the same
trend being observed for all assemblies. The experimental uncertainty

for ?THex was evaluated at 0.3 K. Regarding the uncertainty of Q?C,
the following comments can be made:

? For ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.25 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at
1.5 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 2.6 W and the maximum

Q?C being close to 7.5 W;

? For ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.5 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at
3.0 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 3.6 W and the maximum

Q?C being close to 14.0 W;

? For ? ? 1.23 and f = 0.25 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at
4.5 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 5.3 W and the maximum

Q?C being 20.1 W.

Considering the three cases above, the uncertainty related to the max-

imum Q?C is around 20%. As Q?C decreases, ?TC also decreases since
the mass flow rate is fixed. As a result, the uncertainty related to

Q?C approaches 90% of the calculated Q?C. In both situations, the cal-
culated uncertainties are considerably large. However, based on the
discussion from the previous section and on the good reproducibility of

the robust instrumentation, measurements and data regression.

6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator

This section presents the experimental and numerical results for the
AMR identified as Spheres #3 in Table 3.9, which contains 0.55-mm
Gd spheres assembled as a packed bed in the Casing #3 housing. In the
present analysis, this will be considered the reference AMR geometry.

6.5.1 Experimental Results

6.5.1.1 Characteristic Curves

The cooling capacity, Q?C, as a function of the temperature span, ?THex,
is known as the cooling system characteristic (or performance) curve.
Fig. 6.9 shows the characteristic curves for Spheres #3 as a function
of utilization for frequencies of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. TH was kept at 300
K. The curves were generated increasing the thermal load from a mini-
mum value up to the maximum value, for which ?THex ? 0. As already
discussed, the true zero-load condition cannot be evaluated because of
the external heat gain. However, it can be inferred from extrapolations
of the performance curves.

The results in Fig. 6.9 show that Q?C varies approximately linearly with

?THex. However, for some utilizations, as ?THex increases (and Q?C
decreases), some deviations in the linear trend are seen. This change in
behavior of the system curve can be attributed to: (i) the temperature
and magnetic flux density dependence on the specific heat and MCE;
(ii) the reversibility of the MCE; (iii) the void volume influence on the
AMR performance, as will be explained in Section 6.5.2.

Regarding the differences between ?THex and ?TReg, Fig. 6.10 shows

Q?C as a function of the two temperature spans, ?THex and ?TReg, for
? ? 0.38 and different frequencies. From these results, it is possible
to verify that the differences between ?THex and ?TReg go from ap-

proximately 1 K, for the smallest values of Q?C, to around 2 K for the

maximum values of Q?C. This result strengthens the justification for
choosing ?THex ? 0 for the experimental definition of the maximum
Q?C; alternatively if ?TReg ? 0 was set as the maximum cooling ca-
pacity condition, then ?THex would be negative, which is against the
purpose of a refrigeration system.

6.5.1.2 Total Power (Work) Analysis

Like the torque, the total power consumed by the system is composed
by four contributions: (i) the power to drive the magnetic circuit with-
out the regenerator; (ii) the pumping power; (iii) the power to overcome
the magnetic interaction with the regenerator; (iv) the power to over-
come the mechanical losses. Since there is no relationship between the
magnetic circuit and mechanical loss contributions and the variable re-
generator temperature span or the utilization factor1, to simplify the
analysis, the total power will be divided in only two contributions:

W? = W? Mag + W? pump (6.18)

where W? Mag is the magnetic portion of the total cycle average power

1The magnetic circuit torque increases slightly with frequency, as will be shown
in Appendix A.

that comprises the magnetic circuit and the magnetic interaction with

the regenerator, while W? pump is the portion of the total cycle average
power responsible for generating the oscillatory fluid flow in the system,
including the regenerator and the tubing. For simplicity the power
required to overcome the mechanical losses is included in the pumping
power. The thermodynamic magnetic power is comparatively small

and it is already accounted for in W? Mag.

Fig. 6.11 shows in detail the magnetic and pumping contributions to
the total power as a function of the cold reservoir temperature, TC, for
three different utilization factors (0.28, 0.38 and 0.58) and two operat-
ing frequencies (0.5 and 1 Hz). The uncertainties related to the cycle
average power are of the order of 5% . An analysis of the results leads
to the following conclusions:

Figure 6.11 – W? as a function of TC for different utilization factors
(0.28, 0.38 and 0.58) and frequencies (0.5 and 1 Hz).



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 233

1. As TC is reduced with the increasing temperature span for TH =
300 K, the cycle average total power increases mainly due to the
increase of the magnetic interaction, as the magnetic material be-
comes more ferromagnetic. Also, a small increase in the pumping
contribution is verified, given the increase in fluid viscosity as the
fluid becomes colder;

2. By increasing the utilization for a fixed frequency, W? pump be-
comes higher. For example, for ? ? 0.28, f = 0.5 Hz and TC =
280 K, the contributions of W? Mag and W? pump are 80.2% and
19.8%, respectively. On the other hand, for ? ? 0.58, f = 0.5
Hz and TC = 280 K, the contribution of W? pump is increased to

32.9% and that of W? Mag is reduced to 67.1%. Since TC and TH

are fixed and the absolute value of W? Mag is about the same, the

increase in the total power is due to an increase in W? pump result-
ing from a larger pressure drop and higher mass flow rate. The
same conclusions can be extended to all values of TC and to the
frequency of 1 Hz;

3. By increasing the frequency, the contribution of W? pump is also
increased due to the larger pressure drop and higher mass flow
rate. For example, for ? ? 0.58, f = 0.5 Hz and TC = 280
K, the contributions of W? Mag and W? pump are 67.1% and 32.9%.
However, for ? ? 0.58, f = 1 Hz and TC = 280 K, the contribution
of W? pump is increased to 51.4% and that of W? Mag is reduced to
48.6%, taking into account the additional increase in the magnetic
circuit torque. Thus, the increase in the total power, when the
frequencies of 0.5 Hz and 1 Hz are compared, is mainly due to

the increase in W? pump. The same conclusions can be extended to
all values of TC and to the other utilizations.

In conclusion, the magnetic interaction contribution is more significant
for the smaller values of TC and ?. On the other hand, as the mass flow
rate is increased, by changing the utilization or the operating frequency,
the pumping power becomes more important and, in some cases, is the
main component of the total power.

6.5.1.3 AMR Performance Analysis

The AMR performance analysis is based on the behavior of Q?C, COP
and ?2nd as a function of ? for different lines of constant ?THex, as
shown in Figs. 6.12 to 6.14. Separate figures are used for different
frequencies, namely 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. For the Spheres #3 bed, ?THex
ranges from 5 to 25 K. The main advantage of having ?THex as a
parameter in the plots is the existence of a single ideal coefficient of
performance, COPid, for each line. This facilitates the interpretation
of the results from a thermodynamic efficiency point of view.

It is important to mention that the values of Q?C that correspond to
a given target value of ?THex were evaluated using interpolating func-
tions (R2 &gt; 0.99) of the experimental data shown in the system char-
acteristic curves of Fig. 6.9. The use of the interpolating functions
has a negligible influence on the experimental uncertainty discussed in
Sections 6.3.1 and 6.4.

In the cooling capacity curves, Fig. 6.12, as the value of ?THex in-

creases, Q?C decreases and, depending on the target ?THex, it is possi-

ble to observe a peak of Q?C for a given utilization. For ?THex = 0 and

5 K, the peak of Q?C is outside the experimental utilization range. For
safety reasons, at f = 1 Hz, it was not possible to perform measure-
ments at the highest utilizations due to the high pressure drop in the
regenerator.

Taking the curve for ?THex = 10 K as an example, the following re-
marks can be made:

? For 0.25 Hz, a peak Q?C of approximately 9.5 W (48.6 W/kg) is
observed in the range 0.8 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;1;

? For 0.5 Hz, a peak Q?C of approximately 16.5 W (84.5 W/kg) is
found at ? ? 0.77;

? For 1 Hz the highest value of Q?C for ?THex = 10 K is around 29.2
W (149.5 W/kg), and the peak is outside the utilization range.

In terms of the specific cooling capacity (in W/kg) for ?THex = 10
K, the results are on the same order of magnitude as those from other
published works, as presented in Table 2.2.

Figure 6.12 – Q?C as a function of ? for TH = 300 K and different ?THex:
(a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.

In the COP curves, Fig. 6.13, COP increases as the THex decreases,

owing to the reduction of Q?C (Fig. 6.12) and the increase in W? (Fig. 6.11).
As a result, for a fixed THex, the COP peaks at a certain utilization.
Taking the curve for ?THex = 10 K as an example, the following re-
marks can be made:

? For 0.25 Hz, a peak COP of approximately 3.4 is observed at
? ? 0.77;

? For 0.5 Hz, a peak COP of approximately 2.7 is found at
? ? 0.58;

? For 1 Hz, a peak COP of approximately 1.8 is expected at
0.38 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;0.58.

The smallest frequency presented the highest COP , since W? is directly
proportional to the motor frequency. Moreover, as the frequency in-

creases, both Q?C and W? increase, since the penalties associated with
the viscous losses become more significant as the superficial flow veloc-
ity is raised, requiring a larger total power to drive the AMR. In terms

of the utilization factor, the peaks of the COP and Q?C do not neces-

sarily coincide, as a result of the steeper increase in W? as ? increases.
In summary, as ? or f increase, the COP becomes more sensitive to
the viscous losses.

The behavior of the second-law efficiency with respect to utilization and
?THex is presented in Fig. 6.14. The lines of constant ?THex correspond
to fixed values of COPid, which decrease as ?THex increases. From a
thermodynamic efficiency standpoint, the best operating conditions for
each ?THex are clearly identified for each frequency in Fig. 6.14. Some
general quantitative remarks can be made as follows:

Although peaks in second-law efficiency can be identified for each ope-
rating condition, direct comparisons between curves for the same ?THex
at different frequencies must be made cautiously, as the cooling capacity
is not the same. However, it is clear that the tests with the Spheres



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 241

#3 AMR assembled in Casing #3 with 0.55-mm spheres resulted in
more thermodynamically efficient conditions for ?THex around 15 and
20 K. For temperature spans smaller than these, although the COP
is the highest (see Fig. 6.13), COPid is much higher. For the largest
?THex of 25 K, COPid is lower, but the system COP is already too
low due to a combination of a low cooling capacity and a high total
power, which increases mainly due to a higher magnetic attraction of
the ferromagnetic phase, as seen in Fig. 6.11. At intermediate values of
?THex, the effects are counterbalanced. It should be mentioned that,
for a given ?THex, the value of utilization that gives the maximum ?2nd
also gives the maximum COP . This is because COPid is constant for
a given ?THex.

The occurrence of maximum second-law efficiencies for ?THex between
15 and 20 K reflects one of the main limitations of current AMR sys-
tems, for which the best performance in terms of ?2nd is not compatible
with the high cooling capacity/large temperature span operation typ-
ical of commercially available cooling systems. On the contrary, (i)
for the highest attainable cooling capacities, the temperature span was
small and the lowest values of ?2nd were found; (ii) for the highest tem-
perature span, both the cooling capacity and the COP were low, which
reduced ?2nd.

Although they are out of the scope of this thesis, some reflections and
guidelines to improve the performance of AMR systems equipped with
standard magnetocaloric materials are in order, given the experience
accumulated in this study:

1. The use of higher operating frequencies increases the cooling ca-
pacity, but does not necessarily increase the temperature span.
Moreover, it increases the viscous losses. Also, as shown in the
results, increasing the motor frequency reduces the system COP .
A more appropriate approach would be to increase the AMR fre-
quency keeping a lower motor operating frequency, for example,
using a magnetic circuit with 2 or more magnetic poles;

2. The arrangement of regenerators in parallel increases the cooling
capacity due to the larger mass of magnetocaloric material and
guarantees a continuous cycle. However, this configuration does
not increase the temperature span and adds to the complexity of
the combined design of the AMR and flow distribution system.
Therefore, if this design is not performed carefully, the cooling



242 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

system may not perform adequately in terms of COP and ?THex;

3. The arrangement of regenerators in series (e.g., cascade) can im-
prove the system temperature span, but does not increase the
cooling capacity. In addition, this arrangement usually requires
a larger total power to overcome the viscous losses.

Figs. 6.15 and 6.16 present the maximum values of ?THex and Q?C,
respectively, as a function of frequency and utilization. The maximum

Q?C was obtained directly for the condition ?THex = 0. However, the
maximum ?THex could not be characterized experimentally because,
even when the electrical heater was not in operation, the zero thermal
load condition cannot be truly obtained because of the heat gain from
the ambient. This way, the maximum ?THex was determined from
an extrapolation/interpolation of the system curves (Fig. 6.9). The
uncertainty of this extrapolation was estimated at 2 K.

trends reported by other authors in the literature (NIELSEN et al., 2009;
TUSEK et al., 2011) where, depending on the frequency, a peak can be
identified. The following quantitative features can be obtained from
Fig. 6.15 as follows:

? For 0.25 Hz, a peak close to 30 K was found at ? ? 0.38;

? For 0.5 Hz, a peak close to 35 K seems is likely in the range
0.21 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;0.38;

? For 1 Hz, no peak was observed and a maximum ?THex of 37.5
K was found at ? ? 0.14;

Taking the f = 0.25 Hz curve as an example, for ? &gt; 0.38, the re-
generator effectiveness decreases with the reduction of the NTU due
to the increasing mass flow rate, and, as a result, ?THex decreases.
On the other hand, for ? &amp;lt;0.38, the tendency is for the regenerator
effectiveness to increase due to the increase in NTU, however, due to



244 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

thermal losses, ?THex decreases. In this situation, two types of losses
are the most important: (i) the axial heat conduction that reduces the
regenerator effectiveness at small values of utilizations, as discussed
in Chapter 5; (ii) the casing heat gain. As will be shown in Section
6.5.2, the casing heat gain is the most significant thermal loss at low
frequencies, because the AMR cooling capacity is usually small. As the
frequency increases, the peak of ?THex is shifted to small values of ?
because, the magnitude of the axial heat conduction is reduced and,
as the AMR cooling capacity increases, the relative importance of the
casing heat gain decreases.

Regarding the behavior of the maximum Q?C, it increases with the uti-
lization for all frequencies and the peaks, if any, are out of the utilization
range. In this case, the axial heat conduction is negligible and the cas-
ing heat gain is very small. However, as will be explained in detail in
Section 6.5.2, the void volume has an important influence on the max-
imum cooling load. The maximum cooling capacities were obtained at
the highest utilizations tested. For each frequency, namely, 0.25, 0.5
and 1 Hz, these were equal to 20.1, 38.8 and 53.7 W, respectively. The
corresponding specific cooling capacities were equal to 103, 198.7 and
275 W/kg, respectively.

6.5.2 Numerical Results and Losses Analyses

This section will present and discuss the numerical results for the
Spheres #3 AMR. Simulations were performed with and without the
terms responsible for the different types of losses in the numerical
model, for the same ranges of frequency, utilization and ?THex ex-
plored in the experiments. It is worth mentioning that the simulations
labeled as without losses already take into account the axial heat con-
duction, viscous dissipation and the demagnetization losses, as these
are intrinsic to AMR regenerators. To be consistent with the experi-
ments, in the simulations including losses, TAmb = TMag = TH = 300
K. More specifically, the following loss terms are considered:

1. Casing heat gain (CHG): this loss corresponds to the heat transfer
from the external environment (i.e., the magnetic circuit) to the
regenerative matrix;

2. Non-uniformity of the magnetic field (MF): this loss corresponds
to non-uniformities (i.e., density reductions) of the axial profile



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 245

of the magnetic flux density due to edge effects in the magnetic
circuit. The axial profile of the magnetic flux density was exper-
imentally characterized and was presented in Fig. 3.12(b);

3. Void volume (VV): these are leakage losses, already discussed in
detail in Chapter 5, in the context of passive regenerators. Similar
effects are expected here.

Fig. 6.17 shows a comparison between the numerical results and exper-

imental data for Q?C as a function of ?THex for different values of uti-
lization (0.38, 0.58 and 0.77) and frequency (0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz). The
numerical simulations were performed considering: (i) no losses; (ii)
with CHG loss; (iii) with CHG+MF losses; (iv) with CHG+MF+VV
losses. This enables the evaluation of the impact of each loss on the
AMR performance and, clearly, as the losses are included in the simula-
tion, the numerical results get closer to the experimental data, showing
a very good agreement for all the operating conditions.

The model without losses over-predict the data for virtually all condi-
tions, with the deviations increasing with the increase of ?THex, as the
zero thermal load conditions are approached. These deviations can be
justified based on the thermal losses in the AMR, especially the casing
heat gain. A first remark in support of the casing heat gain as the
main thermal loss in an AMR system is the behavior near the point of
maximum cooling capacity, at which the no-loss model results and the
experimental data are very close. At this condition, ?THex ? 0 K (i.e.,
TAmb ? TH ? TC ), thus, the casing heat gain is small and its influence
on the Q?C is negligible.

When the casing heat gain is included in the simulations, the numerical
results in Fig. 6.17 show an impressive reduction of the AMR perfor-
mance curve, especially near the maximum temperature span. For
example, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz, a reduction of approximately
13 K is observed for ?THex at zero load. In addition, the following ob-
servations can be made regarding the simulations including the CHG
thermal loss:

? For a fixed frequency, as the utilization factor is increased, the

impact of the CHG on the Q?C vs. ?THex curves is reduced. For
example, for ? ? 0.77 and f = 0.25 Hz, the no-loss maximum
?THex is 37 K and, considering the CHG loss, the maximum
?THex is close to 30 K, i.e., a reduction of 7 K;

and frequency, considering different types of losses.



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 247

? For a fixed utilization (e.g., ? ? 0.38), increasing the frequency
also reduces the impact of the CHG on the Q?C vs. ?THex curves.
For example, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 1 Hz, the no loss maximum
?THex is 42 K and, considering the CHG loss, the maximum
?THex is close to 38 K, representing a reduction of 4 K.

To substantiate this analysis, Fig. 6.18 shows the cycle average casing
heat gain for the discrete finite volumes, i.e., volume 1 to volume 200,
along the axial direction. Fig. 6.18(a) shows the results for different
values of ?THex for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz. Fig. 6.18(b) shows
the effect of the operating frequency for ? ? 0.38 and ?THex = 25 K.
At last, Fig. 6.18(c) shows the influence of the utilization factor for
?THex = 25 K and f = 0.25 Hz.

In Fig. 6.18, volume 1 is close to the regenerator hot end and volume
200 is next to the cold end. In the simulations, the magnetic circuit
was assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the ambient at 300 K,
which is the temperature of the hot reservoir. As a result, the volumes
closer to the hot end present a negative heat gain. In other words, this
portion of the regenerator is at a higher temperature than the magnetic
circuit (remember that THE &gt; TH), and the AMR transfers heat to the
Halbach magnets. As the regenerator becomes colder, the heat gain
increases up to a maximum at the cold end. These results show how
important it was to be strict about the thermal equilibrium condition
of TAmb = TMag = TH discussed in Section 6.1, so that the CHG always
reduces the AMR performance, which is a more realistic condition in
terms of applications of cooling systems.

Considering a single finite volume, at a given time-step, the CHG is re-
sponsible for a small amount of heat being added to the energy balance,
whose main effects can be summarized as follows:

? During the hot period of the cycle (i.e., magnetization and cold
blow) the amount of heat entering the colder part of the regener-
ator is combined with the positive MCE and the enthalpy fluxes
(in and out), resulting in a new thermal condition. Part of the
CHG modifies the temperature profiles at the end of the hot pe-
riod, and the remainder is released at the hot reservoir and in the
hotter part of the regenerator;

? During the cold period of the cycle (i.e., demagnetization and
hot blow) the MCE is negative. Thus, a fraction of the MCE is



248 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

consumed by the CHG. This, together with the enthalpy fluxes,
yields a new thermal condition in the volume. As a result, the
cooling capacity decreases, as part of the refrigerating effect is
counterbalanced by the heat gained from the external environ-
ment.

In Fig. 6.18(a), for fixed values of utilization and frequency, by increas-
ing ?THex, the casing heat gain in a given volume increased. In terms
of the cycle-average cooling capacity, Table 6.1 shows the reduction of

Q?C as ?THex increases. For ?THex = 25 K, the reduction in Q?C was
1.49 W, which represented 37% of the AMR potential (no loss) cooling
capacity.

capacity for different values of ?THex, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz.

In Fig. 6.18(b), by increasing the operating frequency, for fixed values of
utilization and ?THex, the casing heat gain in a given volume increases.
As discussed in Chapter 5, since the regenerator temperature profiles
did not have substantial variations with frequency, in this case, the
change in the total casing heat gain is quite small, which is related to
the increasing wall heat transfer coefficient with frequency (see Section
4.3.6). In terms of the cycle average cooling capacity, presented in
Table 6.2, increasing the frequency causes a reduction of the percentage

decrease in Q?C compared with the no-loss cooling capacity.

Figure 6.18 – Cycle average casing heat gain at different regenerator
positions (finite volumes) for: (a) Different ?THex for ? ? 0.38 and f =
0.25 Hz; (b) Different operating frequencies for ? ? 0.38 and ?THex =
25 K; (c) Different utilization factors for f = 0.25 Hz and ?THex = 25
K.

Increasing the utilization factor for a fixed frequency and ?THex,
Fig. 6.18(c), causes a somewhat different effect on the casing heat gain
in a given volume. In this case, as ? increases and the effectiveness
decreases, different temperature profiles are established along the re-
generator. As a result, the local heat gain presents a high dependence
on the local temperature difference (at each finite volume) and on the
increasing heat transfer coefficient due to the higher mass flow rate. In
turn, the cycle average cooling capacity, presented in Table 6.3, showed
that increasing ? increases the penalties with respect to the no loss
cooling capacity.

All the results and discussions presented above clearly show that the
casing heat gain changes the local thermal equilibrium along the re-
generative matrix and reduces the refrigerating effect of the AMR.



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 251

Table 6.3 – Impact of the casing heat gain on the cycle average cooling
capacity for different values of ?, for f = 0.25 Hz and ?THex of 25 K.

? [-] No losses [W] CHG [W] Variation [W]

0.58 5.44 3.27 2.17 (39.9%)
0.77 5.96 2.70 3.27 (54.8%)

Therefore, in cases where the cooling capacity is small, i.e., for low
utilization factors and low frequencies, the penalties associated with
the casing heat gain are more pronounced because the magnetic refrig-
erating effect required to counterbalance the casing heat gain is on the
same order of the cooling capacity, especially for large ?THex.

This discussion supports the differences observed in the maximum tem-
perature span between the model without losses and the experimental
data. Considering f = 0.25 Hz and ? ? 0.38, while the experiments
gave the smallest maximum ?THex, Fig. 6.15, the zero-loss model gave
the highest maximum ?THex for all conditions, Fig. 6.17. However,
when the casing heat gain is included in the simulations, a reduction of
the potential cooling capacity of the order of 3 W is already sufficient to
reduce the maximum temperature span to 35 K, as shown in Fig. 6.17.

When the non-uniformity in the magnetic field (MF) is incorporated in
the model (CHG+MF losses), the local magnetic field is reduced, which
causes an almost uniform decrease in the characteristic curves. The
consideration of an axial magnetic flux density profile is important for
the local demagnetization loss, which depends on the applied magnetic
flux density and the local temperature of the regenerator matrix.

Finally, the inclusion of the void volume (VV) losses modifies even

further the trends of the Q?C vs. ?THex curves, improving consid-
erably the prediction of the experimental results. The following re-
marks can be made based on an analysis of the results considering the
CHG+MF+VV losses in Fig. 6.17:

1. For ?THex &gt; 15 K, the characteristic curves exhibit a fairly linear
trend, but with a different inclination in comparison with the
simulated cases in which the VV was not included;

2. For ?THex &amp;lt;15 K, all characteristic curves show a clear deviation
from the linear trend;

3. For ?THex = 0, the numerical results with the CHG+MF+VV

losses gave higher values of the maximum Q?C.

To facilitate the interpretation of the points explained above, Fig. 6.19
presents a comparison between the numerical results and the experi-
mental data for the time-dependent temperatures at the hot and cold
ends for different operating conditions. Fig. 6.19(a) shows results for
different ?THex and Fig. 6.19(b) for ?THex ? 0. The following remarks
can be made:

1. The AMR model showed good predictions of the time-dependent
temperatures at the hot and cold ends;

2. Comparing the experimental and numerical results for THE and
TCE, it is clearly seen that they are not symmetric, i.e., the peak of
THE has a smooth round shape, while TCE has a sharp valley. This
behavior is caused by the angular (or time) dependence of the
magnetic flux density in Nested Halbach cylinders (see Figs 3.10
and 3.15). During the hot cycle (0 ? t? ? 180o) the magnetic
flux density varies smoothly and during the cold cycle (180o ?
angle ? 360o) a sharp change is observed. The MCE resulting
from this magnetic field variation clearly has an impact on the
temperature of the fluid leaving the regenerator bed at THE and
TCE;

3. The discontinuities caused by the void volume on the time-depen-
dent temperature are clearly visible, such as for TCE at t

? ? 0.

As in passive regenerators, the existence of void volumes on each side of
the AMR alters the temperature boundary conditions of the regenerator
thermal balance. However, contrary to the passive regenerator case,
the void volume influence on the temperature boundary conditions can
sometimes improve the AMR performance.

To explain how the void volume influences the AMR performance, it
is necessary to understand the behavior of the TC data (green open
square symbols) in Fig. 6.19. If the values of TCE corresponding to the
fluid trapped in the void volume are below TC, then the fluid returns to
the regenerator at a temperature lower than that of the cold reservoir.

As a result, it helps to cool down the matrix during the cold blow. This

was the case for the maximum Q?C conditions shown in Fig. 6.19(b),

which explains the improvement of the maximum Q?C observed when
the void volume is included in the simulations.

On the other hand, if the values of TCE corresponding to the fluid
trapped in the void volume are above TC, as in some cases of Fig. 6.19(a),
the fluid that returns to the regenerator is warmer than the cold reser-
voir, which reduces the cooling capacity of the AMR. This explains the
reduction of the maximum ?THex when the void volume was included

on the simulations. The intermediate points of the Q?C vs. ?THex curves
can represent one of these two situations. However, it should be noted
that the temperature of the fluid exiting the regenerator is extremely
dependent on the void volume size, operating parameters, thermophys-
ical and magnetocaloric properties of the regenerative material, and
regenerator effectiveness.

Fig. 6.20 presents a comparison between the numerical results including

the CHG+MF+VV losses and the experimental data for Q?C as a func-
tion of ? and ?THex. Each plot corresponds to a different frequency.
The following remarks can be made:

1. For f = 0.25 Hz, the numerical results are in very good agree-
ment with the experimental data for all values of utilization. A
maximum deviation of 3 W was found for the largest value of
utilization;

2. For f = 0.5 and 1 Hz, the numerical results reproduced the ex-
perimental trends quite well. However, for some values of ?THex,
the model overestimates the experimental cooling capacity, for
which a maximum deviation of 9 W was observed at high values
of utilization;

3. For some ?THex at the smallest utilizations, especially for f =
0.5 and 1 Hz, the numerical results overestimated the cooling
capacity by as much as 10 W;

4. The model predicted quite accurately the maximum values of Q?C
at ?THex = 0.

(open symbols) for Q?C as a function of ? for TH = 300 K and different
?THex: (a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.

Regarding item 2, the largest differences between the model and the
data was observed for ?THex = 10 and 15 K. This is exactly the region
where the void volume has a major impact on the AMR performance

and the Q?C vs. ?THex curves deviate from their linear behavior (see
Fig. 6.17). Possibly, if the experimental tests were performed with a
better resolution, i.e., using smaller cooling capacity steps in the region
5 &amp;lt;?THex &amp;lt;15 K, the agreement could be improved.

Regarding item 3, this corresponds to the same operating condition
in the passive regenerator tests in which a no flow period was verified
for smallest pumped volumes (see Sections 5.1.2 and 5.4). However,
contrary to what has been observed for passive regenerators results, in
the AMR tests a smaller mass flow rate reduces the cooling capacity,
which explains the over prediction of the numerical results.



6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 257

Fig. 6.21 shows comparisons between the experimental data and nu-
merical results for the maximum ?THex as a function of ? for the three
frequencies. The numerical results are presented for two situations: (i)
without losses and (ii) with the CHG+MF+VV losses. As mentioned
in Section 6.5.1.3, it is quite common in the literature to attribute the
reduction of the maximum ?THex at small ? to axial heat conduction
in the matrix (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TUSEK et al., 2011). However, the
model without losses already takes into account axial heat conduction
in the fluid and solid phases. As can be seen, the no-loss numerical
results severely overestimate the experimental data. Clearly, the de-
pendence of the maximum ?THex on the utilization factor results from
a combination of different losses in the AMR, axial heat conduction be-
ing one of them. The incorporation of the casing heat gain, magnetic
flux density non-uniformity and void volume losses improves significant
the prediction of the experimental data for ?THex as a function of the
utilization factor. An analysis of the numerical results revealed that
the casing heat gain was the main contributing factor to the reduction
of the AMR performance in the present experiments. Based on the
analysis presented in this section, the following recommendations can
be made regarding the design of AMR systems:

1. A systematic evaluation/quantification of the thermal-hydraulic
and magnetic losses is a powerful tool to improve AMR design;

2. The inclusion of the different types of losses in numerical models
for AMR systems is of paramount importance. Without them, a
robust and reliable analysis of the results is not possible;

3. The thermal insulation of the AMR is an important additional
parameter to be taken into account in the design and evaluation
of AMRs. This way, possible design strategies could involve the
optimization of the AMR cross sectional area together with the
thermal insulation thickness, so that the reduction of the sectional
area can be compensated by a better thermal insulation of the
regenerator assembly.

6.6 Performance Assessment of Different
Matrix Geometries

This section presents comparisons of the AMR performance for three
Gd matrices: (i) Spheres #4, which consists of a packed bed of 0.78-
mm Gd spheres assembled in Casing #4, (ii) Plates #5 and (iii) Pins
#6. The geometric properties and characteristics of these matrices
are presented in Table 3.9. The performance analysis is based on the

behavior of Q?C, COP and ?2nd as a function of ? for different values
of ?THex. In the present analysis, ?THex was varied from 3 to 18 K, in
steps of 3 K. As in the experimental analysis for the Spheres #3 matrix,
interpolating functions were used to transform the characteristic curves

into curves of Q?C as a function of ?, having ?THex as a parameter.



260 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

The experimental uncertainties associated with the measurements in
all geometries evaluated in this section are similar to those for the
Spheres #3 tests.

As in the passive regenerator experiments, the three matrix geometries
have approximately the same equivalent particle diameter and porosity.
The results for the cooling capacity as a function of utilization for f =
0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz, are shown in Figs. 6.22 to Fig. 6.24. Figs. 6.25
to Fig. 6.27 show the results for the COP as a function of ? for f =
0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. Figs. 6.28 to 6.30 present the results for ?2nd as a
function of ? for f = 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz.

Before starting the performance analysis, it is important to mention
that, since the void volume size is about the same for the three re-
generators, its impact on the AMR performance comparison can be
disregarded. Also, the gadolinium used to manufacture the spheres
and the pins and plates came from different suppliers, and there is no
information regarding the purity or the magnetocaloric properties of
the samples. Thus, the performance analysis does not take into ac-
count any difference regarding the MCE of the samples. Therefore, the
following comparisons take into consideration the effectiveness of the
regenerative matrix, the demagnetization factor and the casing heat
gain.

The parameters associated with the demagnetization factor, namely
ND,geo, ND,csg and ND (see Eq. (4.49)) are presented in Table 6.4. Al-
though a single plate or pin presents a much smaller ND,geo compared
with a single sphere, the value of ND,csg counterbalances the overall de-
magnetization factor. As a result, the difference between the maximum
and minimum ND is of the order of 0.11, with the pin array presenting
the lowest overall demagnetizing factor.

Table 6.4 – Demagnetizing factors for the different AMR matrices.

Matrix ND,geo [-] ND,csg [-] ND [-]

Spheres #4 0.330 0.466 0.417
Pins 0.020 0.470 0.302

Plates 0.033 0.470 0.313

The cooling capacity results in Figs. 6.22 to Fig. 6.24 reveal that, for
all operating frequencies, the parallel plate AMR presented a poorer
performance when compared with the remaining geometries. Only at

the smallest utilization Q?C for this geometry was comparable to the



6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 261

results for pins and spheres, which is consistent with the thermal ef-
fectiveness results for the passive geometries shown in Section 5.3.4.
Since the demagnetization factor for the plate geometry is smaller than
for the packed bed of spheres and very close to that for the pin array,
the poorer AMR performance cannot be attributed to magnetic losses,
so the casing heat gain appears to be the main contributing factor to
the comparatively low cycle-average cooling capacity. In the plate ge-
ometry, there is a large fraction of the matrix area in direct contact
with the ABS casing, i.e., the two sides and the continuous base. This
certainly contributes a lot to increasing the casing heat gain.

The pin and packed sphere matrices exhibited similar cooling capacity
performances. For a fixed ?THex, the packed bed has a slightly higher
cooling capacity, especially for f = 1 Hz. This is also in agreement
with the passive regenerator effectiveness results. On the other hand,
since the pin array has a smaller demagnetizing factor than the packed
bed, it may be that the heat gain is higher in the pin array matrix than
in the packed bed. As in the plate matrix, the pin array also has a
continuous base in contact with the ABS housing, which can increase
the heat gain. Somehow, the demagnetizing field and the casing heat
gain effects counterbalance each other, and both geometries present
similar performances curves. Only for f = 1 Hz, it seems that the casing
heat gain for the pins is higher than the effect of the demagnetizing field
for the packed bed, which seems to agree with the discussion in Section
6.5.2.

Before addressing the results for the COP as a function of the utiliza-
tion, Figs. 6.25 to Fig. 6.27, it is important to observe that: (i) since the
total mass of Gd in the three regenerators is approximately the same,
and since the AMR performance is evaluated at a fixed TC, the varia-

tion of W? Mag can be neglected when the three matrices are compared;
(ii) from the passive regenerator results, the three matrices presented
different values of pressure drop, with the parallel plate regenerator
presenting the lowest and the packed bed the highest pumping power.
Thus, for a fixed TC, the total power can be compared among the dif-
ferent geometries only in terms of the pumping power contribution.

The parallel plate regenerator presents the smallest values of W? due to
the smallest viscous losses. However, its performance is the poorest in
comparison with the other matrices, resulting in the smallest COP . On
the other hand, since the pumping power for the pin array is smaller
than in the packed bed, the COP for the pins is a bit higher than for



262 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

the spheres, especially at higher values of ?THex and lower frequencies
(0.25 and 0.5 Hz). For f = 1 Hz the pin and packed sphere geometries
present basically the same results for the COP .

As expected, the second-law efficiency, Figs. 6.28 to Fig. 6.30, follows
similar trends as the COP , with the pin array showing slightly higher
values of ?2nd for 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, while for 1 Hz, the pins and spheres
presented very similar results. Taking the frequency of 0.5 Hz as an
example, the following remarks can be made:

1. For the parallel plates, a peak ?2nd of approximately 3% was

observed for a ?THex of 9 K and ? ? 0.32, Q?C ? 3.5 W (40
W/kg) and COP of 0.9;

2. For the packed bed of spheres, a peak ?2nd of approximately 5%
was observed for ?THex of 12 K and 15 K and ? ? 0.5. Consid-
ering ?THex = 12 K, Q?C ? 5.5 W (65.6 W/kg) with a COP of
about 1.2;

3. For the pin array, a peak ?2nd of approximately 5.5% was observed
for ?THex of 12 K and 15 K and ? ? 0.5. Considering ?THex =
12 K, Q?C ? 5.25 W (58.5 W/kg) with a COP of about 1.4;

Figure 6.30 – ?2nd as a function of ? for the three matrix geometries:
f = 1 Hz, TH = 300 K and different ?THex.



272 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators

Fig. 6.31 presents a comparison between the AMR regenerator geome-
tries regarding the maximum ?THex as a function of ? for the different
frequencies of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. As performed for Spheres #3, the
maximum ?THex was determined from an extrapolation/interpolation
of the system curves. The trends are somewhat similar to those for
Spheres#3, allowing the following remarks to be made:

1. For all the geometries, the points of maximum ?THex are found
at small utilization factors. This corroborates the assumption
that the regenerators assembled in Casings #4, #5 and #6 have
lower casing heat gains because of their better thermal insulation,
owing to the additional ABS housing, compared with Casing #3;

2. For all the frequencies, the points of maximum temperature span
for the parallel plate geometry were always lower than for the
remaining geometries. This supports the argument of a larger
casing heat gain for the plates geometry.

All geometries showed their best performance, in terms of the maximum
?THex, at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. These results are supported by the
following points: (i) at this frequency, the regenerator effectiveness is
higher than at 1 Hz; (ii) as shown in item (1) above, the casing heat
gain is smaller for Casings #4, #5 and #6 than for Casing #3 (used
in Spheres #3). In the case of Spheres #3, this matrix also presented
a higher effectiveness at 0.5 Hz, however, since the casing heat gain
presents a larger impact on the regenerator performance, the frequency
of 1 Hz showed a higher maximum ?THex.

Regarding the utilization factor, for f = 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, comparing
the pins and spheres matrices, it is observed that for small ? the pins
presented a larger maximum ?THex, while for ? &gt; 1 the packed spheres
matrix had a higher maximum ?THex. This result can be attributed
first to the higher effectiveness (smaller axial heat conduction loss) and
lower demagnetizing loss of the pin array geometry at low utilizations
and high temperature spans. As the utilization increases and the tem-
perature span decreases, the spheres packed bed thermal performance
improves, given the reduction of the axial heat condition and demag-
netizing losses, and due to a better effectiveness of this matrix at high
utilizations. For f = 1 Hz, both geometries presented the same values
of maximum ?THex which can be attributed to the higher heat gain
for the pin array, as explained previously in this section.

Fig. 6.32 makes a comparison of the maximum Q?C as a function of the
utilization factor for all regenerative matrices, for the three frequen-
cies. In general, the results presented the expected trend, i.e., with a
distinct peak at some operating conditions. As expected, the peaks of

maximum Q?C for the three geometries at the three frequencies is ob-

served in the range 1 ? ? ? 2. Moreover, in terms of the maximum Q?C,
the spheres regenerator presented a better performance, especially at
higher utilizations, where this geometry is the most thermally effective
in terms of heat transfer. Also, at TH = 300 K and zero span, the axial
heat conduction and the demagnetizing effects are lower, contributing
to a better performance of the spheres packed beds.

In conclusion, the pin array and the packed bed of spheres are the most
promising regenerative geometries for magnetic refrigeration. If, on the
one hand, the packed bed presented slightly higher cooling capacities,
on the other hand, the pin array had lower penalties associated with
the viscous losses and, as a consequence, a little higher values of COP
and ?2nd. However, considering the manufacturing of the regenerator,
the packed bed of spheres is by far the best option for applications
in AMRs. The WEDM technique employed to fabricate the pin array
is still time consuming and expensive to be considered for large scale
production.

7 Optimization of Thermal
Regenerators

The thermodynamic efficiencies of regenerative cooling cycles are di-
rectly linked to the heat transfer effectiveness and viscous losses in the
regenerator. In a heat exchanger, there must be good thermal con-
tact between the fluid and solid phases, but the latter should offer a
small resistance to the fluid flow. These conflicting requirements are
often equalized using thermal optimization. A regenerator can be de-
signed for optimal performance according to the Entropy Generation
Minimization (EGM) method (BEJAN, 1996). In active magnetic re-
generators, the structure and geometry of the solid matrix have to
be optimized to reduce the thermal, viscous and magnetic losses and
achieve the desired operating conditions of temperature span, cooling
capacity and cycle efficiency.

The present chapter advances a performance analysis of thermal pas-
sive and active magnetic regenerators based on the Entropy Genera-
tion Minimization (EGM) theory. The cycle-average entropy genera-
tion contributions are due to: axial heat conduction, fluid friction and
interstitial heat transfer. It is important to notice that, in the cases
where the magnetocaloric effect is reversible and does not present irre-
versibilities like magnetic and thermal hysteresis, there is no additional
(i.e., magnetic) contribution to the cycle-average entropy generation.
The influences of parameters such as the mass flow rate, operating
frequency, regenerator cross sectional area, housing aspect ratio, uti-
lization factor and particle diameter are evaluated according to the fol-
lowing performance evaluation criteria (PEC): variable geometry (VG)
and fixed face (cross-section) area (FA).

7.1 Entropy Generation Model

In a thermal regenerator, entropy is generated due to heat transfer and
viscous dissipation. Selecting a control volume containing the solid
and fluid phases of the porous media, as presented in Fig. 7.1, the

Thus, replacing Eqs. (7.2) to (7.4) in Eq. (7.1) and using the heat fluxes

where the first term on the right is the entropy generation rate per

Sg (in [J/K]) will be used as the objective function to be minimized
in the regenerator optimization. Also, Eq. (7.8) is used to calculate
the local rate of entropy generation per unit volume in passive and ac-
tive magnetic regenerators. In cases where the magnetocaloric effect is
reversible, such as in materials with a continuous magnetic transition
(e.g., gadolinium), the local rate of entropy generation due to the MCE
is directly included in the interphase heat transfer. In this case, the
?Tad resulting from the external magnetic flux density variation cre-
ates a finite temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases.
Otherwise, if irreversibilities are present, such as magnetic and thermal
hysteresis, additional terms have to be included in Eq. (7.8) to com-
pute these irreversibilities. However, these will not be necessary in the
present thesis, as Gd is the magnetocaloric material being considered.

7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-
Flow Regenerators

This section presents and discusses the results for the optimization of
passive oscillating-flow regenerators. The analysis considers packed bed
matrices composed by stainless steel spheres of different sizes. To the
fluid phase was considered as pure water.

7.2.1 Performance Evaluation Criteria for Passive
Regenerators

The EGM calculations were carried out based on the PEC of Webb and
Kim (WEBB; KIM, 2005). The first criterion is of Variable Geometry
(VG), for which the regenerator housing cross sectional area, or the
housing diameter, Dh,Reg, and the length, LReg, are allowed to vary,
keeping a constant housing volume. The second criterion is of Fixed
Face Area (FA), where the regenerator housing cross sectional area is
kept constant and the regenerator length can vary, thus changing also
the housing volume. For reasons that will be discussed later, the Fixed
Geometry (FG) criterion was not evaluated for passive regenerators.
The baseline (reference) housing geometry has the following geometric
characteristics: Dh,Reg = 25 mm and ? = 2, where ? = Lreg/Dh,Reg is
the aspect ratio of the regenerator housing. Thus, the baseline regen-
erator housing volume is 24.544 cm3, and the ranges of the variables
explored in the analysis are presented in Table 7.1. A flow chart of
the various scenarios is shown in Fig. 7.2. The operating conditions
(i.e., frequency and mass flow rates) and ranges of geometric parame-
ters evaluated were chosen so as to be consistent with figures currently
encountered in active magnetic regenerators (YU et al., 2010; NIELSEN
et al., 2011).

Figure 7.2 – Flow chart of the various scenarios evaluated in the simu-
lations for the passive regenerator optimization.

As can be seen from Table 7.1, all the possible Dh,Reg and ? combi-
nations in the VG criterion result in a fixed housing volume of 24.544
cm3. The particle diameter is varied from 0.2 to 2 mm, for each possi-
ble combination. In the FA criterion, Dh,Reg is fixed at 25 mm, while
? is changed from 1 to 8. The particle diameter is also varied from 0.2
to 2 mm for each possible combination.

For each combination of Dh,Reg, ? and dp in each PEC, simulations were
carried out considering two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the
frequency was kept constant at 1 Hz and the mass flow rate was varied
from 40 to 100 kg/h (steps of 10 kg/h) for the VG PEC and from 100
to 300 kg/h (steps of 25 kg/h) for the FA PEC, as presented in Table
7.2. In the second scenario, the frequency was varied from 1 to 4 Hz
(steps of 0.5 Hz) and the mass flow rate was kept constant at 60 kg/h
for the VG PEC and at 250 kg/h for the FA PEC, as presented in
Table 7.3.

As defined previously, the regenerator effectiveness is a measure of the
rate at which heat is transferred between the fluid and solid phases in

a given blow (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981). In the VG and FA PEC,
a fixed regenerator effectiveness is equivalent to a fixed heat transfer
rate when the temperatures of the reservoirs and the frequency or the
mass flow rate are fixed (Tables 7.2 and 7.3). In the present analyses,
a target value for ? was set at 95% (performance constraint).

In the VG cases, for fixed values of frequency, mass flow rate and uti-
lization, the regenerator effectiveness will change as a result of changes
in Dh,Reg and ? (which are reciprocal because of the constant housing

volume constraint) or dp. Changes in cross-section area affect the fluid
superficial velocity, the particle Reynolds number (which is also affected
by dp) and the magnitude of the axial heat conduction. The surface
area per unit volume is directly affected by the particle diameter. In
the FA cases, the interstitial heat transfer coefficient is only a function
of dp, since the superficial velocity is constant for a given mass flow
rate. On the other hand, the interstitial area changes with both dp and
?. The utilization factor decreases with increasing ?, which contributes
to achieving higher values of regenerator effectiveness due to the larger
thermal mass of the solid phase.

It should be noted that the Fixed Geometry (FG) PEC (WEBB; KIM,
2005), i.e., that in which both the regenerator length and cross-section
area are kept fixed, could not be evaluated given the present constraints
because fixing a value of ? in this case does not necessarily correspond
to a fixed cycle-average heat transfer rate.

7.2.2 PEC Numerical Implementation

Each operating condition is defined by a set of constraints specified
according to Table 7.2 (variable mass flow rate) or Table 7.3 (variable
frequency). For a specific operating condition, the ranges of the geo-
metric variables (e.g., housing and particle diameters and aspect ratio)
are chosen according to each PEC (VG or FA), as shown in Table 7.1.
For each point in the range associated with a given PEC, the momen-
tum and energy equations are solved numerically and the cycle-average
entropy generation is calculated.

For each scenario of the VG PEC (i.e., variable frequency or variable
mass flow rate), discrete data points were selected in the housing diam-
eter and particle diameter ranges shown in Table 7.1 (incremental steps
of 5 mm for Dh,Reg and 0.1 mm for dp), resulting in 266 independent
cases. Similarly, for the FA PEC, the aspect ratio range was divided in
incremental steps of 0.5 (plus the 0.1 mm steps for dp), resulting in 342
cases for the variable frequency and variable mass flow rate scenarios.
In total, 9196 different simulations were performed for the VG and FA
PEC. The searches for the points of minimum entropy generation were
refined further by means of 4th-order (or less) polynomial interpola-
tions (R2 &gt; 0.9999), which guaranteed the stability of the numerical
solutions and a better resolution (finer than 0.5 mm for Dh,Reg, 0.05
for ? and 0.01 mm for dp) for the minimum Sg value at a reasonable



7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 285

computational cost.

7.2.3 Entropy Generation-Effectiveness Contour
Maps

As the numerical convergence is obtained for the momentum and en-
ergy equations for a specific case (defined by values of frequency, mass
flow rate and geometric parameters associated with each PEC), the
regenerator configurations that yield the desired value of hot-blow ef-
fectiveness can be identified. To illustrate this, Fig. 7.3 presents the
results for the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and 3
Hz. Fig. 7.4, in turn, presents the results for the FA PEC with m? = 250
kg/h and frequencies of 1 and 3 Hz. Lines of constant Sg (red lines)
are plotted together with lines of constant effectiveness (blue lines), as
a function of the particle diameter and housing diameter for the VG
PEC (Fig. 7.3), and particle diameter and housing aspect ratio for the
FA PEC (Fig. 7.4).

As can be seen from Figs. 7.3 and 7.4, the target value of ? = 95% (blue
solid line) can be achieved with different combinations of dp and Dh,Reg
or ?, with f and m? being held constant for each PEC. According to
the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.3(a), ? = 95%
can be achieved with small values of dp in the 0.2 to 1.3 mm range and
small housing diameters (12.5 to 58 mm), yielding values of ? between
0.16 and 16. Following the line of constant hot-blow effectiveness of
95%, different values of Sg can be achieved with a minimum at around
dp = 1.07 mm and Dh,Reg = 17.23 mm. As the operating frequency is
increased, Fig. 7.3(b), the minimum Sg for ? = 95% is shifted to larger
values of dp, yielding other combinations of Dh,Reg and ?.

For the FA PEC with m? = 250 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.4(a), the
minimum Sg for ? = 95% was identified in the vicinity of dp = 0.59 mm,
with an aspect ratio of around 5.12. As expected, for other frequencies
the minimum Sg range changes and ? = 95% is achieved with other
combinations of dp, Dh,Reg and ?, as presented in Fig. 7.4(b).

generation (interstitial heat transfer, axial conduction and viscous dis-
sipation) for two regenerators with the same housing volume, but very
distinct values of housing diameter and aspect ratio, as seen in Table
7.4. In these two cases, the particle diameter is varied between 0.2 and
2 mm. The flow rate was 60 kg/h and the frequency was 1 Hz in both
cases. However, it must be noted that the hot-blow effectiveness is not
the same for the two simulated cases, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5.

290 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators

Fig. 7.6 shows the total entropy generation and the individual contri-
butions as a function of the particle diameter for Cases 1 and 2 of Table
7.4. Case 1, Fig. 7.6(a), is a thin (small housing diameter) and long
regenerator. As expected, the axial heat conduction contribution is
very small and the total entropy generation is basically a combination
of viscous dissipation (because of the long matrix length and the high
superficial velocity) and interstitial heat transfer. For small particle
diameters, viscous dissipation is the main source of entropy because of
the large values of pressure drop. As the particle diameter increases,
the pressure drop decreases but the interstitial heat transfer becomes
less effective. As a result, the entropy generated due to a finite tempera-
ture difference between the solid and the fluid becomes more important.
A local minimum Sg at a particle diameter of around 0.7 mm can be
verified. However, at this point of minimum entropy generation, the
effectiveness is slightly higher than the desired performance constraint
of 95% effectiveness (see Fig. 7.5).

Case 2, Fig. 7.6(b), illustrates an opposite situation, i.e., a large-diame-
ter short regenerator, for which the contributions of axial heat conduc-
tion are expected to be more important because of the low superficial
velocity and the short regenerator length. The total entropy generation
in Case 2 is a combination of the entropy production by axial heat con-
duction and interstitial heat transfer. As shown in Fig. 7.6(b), for small
particle diameters, axial heat conduction in the solid is the main source
of entropy generation. As the particle diameter increases, interstitial
heat transfer is poorer and the dispersion axial conduction in the fluid
phase becomes more important. In this case, the target effectiveness of
95% is not achieved. It can be concluded, therefore, that this is a poor
regenerator matrix, with low effectiveness and larger Sg values when
compared with Case 1.

7.2.5 Variable Geometry (VG) Evaluation Criteria

7.2.5.1 Fixed Frequency

In this section, the results for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency and
variable mass flow rate are presented as a function of changes in the
geometric parameters. To exemplify the analysis, Fig. 7.7 shows the
variation of Sg as a function of dp, Dh,Reg and ?, for a mass flow rate
of 60 kg/h and a frequency of 1 Hz. These results are for a constant

Figure 7.7 – Entropy generation in the VG PEC, for a mass flow rate
of 60 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, at a constant effectiveness of 95%.

As can be seen in Fig. 7.7, a minimum Sg is clearly achieved. The
dashed lines indicate the optimal values of dp, Dh,Reg and ? - 1.07 mm,
17.23 mm and 6.11, respectively - that result in an effectiveness of 95%
with a minimum entropy production. Repeating the analysis for the
other mass flow rates (see Table 7.2) gives the optimal combinations
of dp, Dh,Reg and ? that guarantee a hot-blow effectiveness of 95%.
The results for the VG PEC for a fixed frequency and variable mass
flow rates are further illustrated in Fig. 7.8. A summary of the condi-
tions associated with the points of minimum Sg is presented in Table
7.5. In addition to the values of the utilization factor, ?, the parti-
cle Reynolds number, Redp = udp/?f, the number of transfer units,
NTU = hAHT/m?cp,f are presented. The individual contributions to
the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min, due to interstitial heat trans-
fer with a finite temperature difference, Sg,HT, axial conduction in the
solid, Sg,SAC, axial conduction in the fluid, Sg,FAC, and viscous dissi-
pation, Sg,VD, are presented in Table 7.6.

A more in-depth evaluation of the results in Fig. 7.8 and Tables 7.5
and 7.6 reveals that for m? = 40 kg/h the optimal region involves bigger
particle diameters, with larger values of Redp . As the interstitial heat
transfer is less effective (lower NTU and higher Sg,HT) and the viscous
losses are smaller for bigger particle diameters, long regenerative matri-
ces with smaller housing diameters are required in order to achieve the
95% regenerator effectiveness, giving rise to the lowest contributions of
axial conduction in the fluid and solid. On the other hand, for m? = 100
kg/h the optimal region involves small particle diameters, larger hous-
ing diameters and smaller values of aspect ratio. Since at high mass
flow rates and small particle diameters the viscous losses become more
important (see the Sg,VD column), a big housing diameter is required
to decrease the superficial velocity, which results in shorter matrices.

Nevertheless, smaller particle diameters are necessary to enhance the
interstitial heat transfer and guarantee an optimal performance of the
regenerator, increasing NTU and decreasing Sg,HT. As a result, the ax-
ial conduction contributions become more important since the spheres
size becomes smaller and the superficial velocity decreases (see the
Sg,SAC and Sg,FAC columns).

In summary, Sg,HT was found to be the main contribution (in %) to the
total entropy generation for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency (although
its importance decreases with flow rate as the NTU increases). The
second largest contribution is Sg,FAC, which increases with the flow
rate since the matrices becomes shorter and the velocity decreases with
increasing housing diameters. The Sg,SAC and Sg,VD contributions are
less important to Sg,min, with Sg,VD increasing with flow rate as a result
of the decrease in particle diameter.

7.2.5.2 Fixed Mass Flow Rate

The results for the VG PEC at a fixed mass flow rate and variable
frequency (see Table 7.3) are presented as a function of changes in
Dh,Reg, ? and dp for a constant effectiveness of 95%. The analysis
discussed in Fig. 7.7 enabled the construction of diagrams to quantify
the effect of frequency and geometric parameters on the cycle-average
entropy generation for ? = 95%, as illustrated in Fig. 7.9. In general,
the regions of minimum Sg with respect to dp, Dh,Reg and ? become
wider as the frequency increases. A summary of the conditions leading
to the minimum Sg results is presented in Table 7.7 and the individual
contributions to the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min, in Table 7.8.

An analysis of the results in Fig. 7.9 and Tables 7.7 and 7.8 reveals that
for f = 1.0 Hz the optimal region involves smaller particle diameters,
which guarantee values of NTU that are sufficiently large to achieve
95% effectiveness. In turn, larger housing diameters and shorter ma-
trices are needed to decrease the superficial velocity and reduce the
viscous losses, which leads to significant axial conduction contributions
to Sg,min. On the other hand, for f = 3.5 Hz the optimal region in-
volves bigger particle diameters, smaller housing diameters and larger
values of the aspect ratio. Since the utilization factor decreases with
increasing frequency, bigger particle diameters, i.e., larger solid ther-
mal mass, are sufficient to guarantee 95% effectiveness, even at lower
values of the NTU. In general, at the highest frequencies, the effec-
tiveness is higher than 95% due to the small values of the utilization
factor. Thus, longer regenerators are required to produce sufficiently
large heat transfer areas and decrease the axial conduction losses. As



298 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators

a consequence, the housing diameter decreases.

It should be noted in Table 7.7 that for f = 4.0 Hz, a minimum Sg was
not found within the ranges of the simulated parameters. A comparison
between the contributions of each term (in %) for the variable frequency
(Table 7.8) and variable mass flow rate (Table 7.6) cases shows that
these are much more sensitive to variations in flow rate for a fixed
frequency.

7.2.6 Fixed Face Area (FA) Evaluation Criteria

7.2.6.1 Fixed Frequency

This section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed frequency
and variable mass flow rate as a function of ? and dp. As mentioned
above, Dh,Reg is constant and kept fixed at 25 mm (see Table 7.2).
Again, the results are illustrated for a target effectiveness of 95%. The
FA PEC is further explored in Fig. 7.10, which shows Sg as a function
of dp and ? for mass flow rates ranging from 100 to 300 kg/h. Table
7.9 summarizes the parameters associated with the optimal conditions
for each mass flow rate. Table 7.10 shows the individual contributions
to the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min.

As can be seen from the results, for m? = 100 kg/h the minimum Sg is
associated with a small particle diameter (dp = 0.21 mm) and a short
matrix (? = 1.674), while for m? = 300 kg/h the minimum Sg was ob-
served at a bigger particle diameter (dp = 0.80 mm) and a longer matrix
(? = 7.003). As the mass flow rate is increased (increasing the super-
ficial velocity and Redp), the advection term becomes more important
in the energy equation and the value of NTU is decreased. Therefore,
a longer regenerator (i.e., a larger interstitial area and a lower utiliza-
tion factor) is required to keep the effectiveness at 95%. However, as
? increases, a larger particle diameter is needed to compensate for the
entropy generated due to the viscous dissipation.

For the FA PEC at a fixed frequency, Sg,HT and Sg,VD are the main
contributions (in %) to the total entropy generation. As the mass flow
rate increases, NTU decreases and ? increases, making the heat transfer
less effective (higher Sg,HT) and, even for increasing particle diameters,
the viscous dissipation becomes more important. Also, the Sg,FAC and
Sg,SAC contributions were found to be significant at lower mass flow

This section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed mass flow
rate of 250 kg/h and variable frequency between 1 and 4 Hz. Again,
changes in ? and dp are evaluated along the line of 95% effectiveness
(see Table7.3). Fig. 7.11 shows the behavior of Sg as a function of dp
and of ? and Table 7.11 summarizes the optimal parameters for each
frequency. Table 7.12 presents the individual contributions to the total
entropy at the minimum, Sg,min.

As seen from Table 7.11, for f = 1 Hz the minimum Sg was found at
a relatively large particle diameter (dp = 0.59 mm) and a large aspect
ratio (? = 5.120), while for f = 4 Hz the minimum Sg was found at a
smaller particle size (dp = 0.27 mm) and a shorter matrix length (? =
1.337).

7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 303

A different trend is observed when the results in this section are com-
pared with the variable mass flow rate cases. As the frequency in-
creases, the utilization factor decreases due to the shorter blow period.
Nevertheless, the matrix length also decreases, reducing the thermal
mass of the solid phase and the total interstitial area. As a result,
the utilization factor and NTU do not present significant variations
with frequency, which result in a nearly constant contribution (in %) of
Sg,HT to Sg,min. At small frequencies Sg,VD was higher even for bigger
particle diameters due to the large value of the matrix length. On the
other hand, higher frequencies need shorter matrix lengths and smaller
particle diameters, which increases the penalty associated with axial
heat conduction (Sg,FAC and Sg,SAC).

7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Re-
generators

The results for the optimization of active magnetic regenerators are
discussed in this section. The simulations were carried out considering
packed bed matrices composed by gadolinium spheres of different sizes.
Eq. (7.8) was applied to calculate the local rate of entropy generation.
The properties of pure water were assumed for the fluid phase. For
simplicity, the magnetic flux density variation is described by a step
function, with minimum and maximum flux densities of 0 and 1.5 T.

7.3.1 Performance Evaluation Criteria for AMRs

The PEC used in the AMR optimization were the same used in the
passive regenerator optimization: the Variable Geometry (VG) and
the Fixed Face Area (FA) (WEBB; KIM, 2005). The ranges of the vari-
ables explored in the analysis are presented in Table 7.13 and the flow
chart of the various scenarios is in Fig. 7.2. The performance con-
straint of an AMR optimization is the cycle-average cooling capacity
at a fixed temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs.
This constraint corresponds to a fixed cycle-average heat transfer rate
at the cold heat exchanger, independently of the matrix size/mass and
operating conditions. In the present analysis, a cycle-average cooling

capacity, Q?c, of 20 W per regenerator is considered, for a tempera-
ture span ?THex = 15 K.



304 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators

Table 7.13 – Ranges of the geometric variables for each PEC in the
AMR optimization.

PEC Dh,Reg [mm] ? Housing volume [cm
3] dp [mm]

VG 12.5 - 50 16 - 0.25 24.544 0.3 - 2
FA 25 1 - 8 12.272 - 98.175 0.3 - 2

As in the passive regenerator optimization procedure, for the VG and
FA PEC, for each combination of Dh,Reg, ? and dp, the simulations were
carried out considering two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the
frequency was kept fixed at 1 Hz and the mass flow rate was varied from
40 to 100 kg/h (steps of 10 kg/h) for the VG PEC and from 50 to 200
kg/h (steps of 25 kg/h) for the FA PEC. In the second scenario, the
frequency was varied from 1 to 4 Hz (steps of 0.5 Hz) and the mass
flow rate was kept constant at 60 kg/h for the VG PEC and at 200
kg/h for the FA PEC.

For each scenario of the VG PEC, discrete data points were selected in
the housing diameter and particle diameter ranges shown in Table 7.13.
The incremental steps were 2.5 mm for the range 12.5 ? Dh,Reg ? 30
mm, 5 mm for 30 ? Dh,Reg ? 50 mm and 0.1 mm for dp, which resulted
in 216 independent cases for each designed mass flow rate or frequency.
Similarly, for the FA PEC, the aspect ratio range was divided in incre-
mental steps of 0.5, plus the 0.1-mm steps for dp, resulting in 270 cases
for the variable frequency and variable mass flow rate scenarios for each
designed mass flow rate or frequency. In total, 6804 different simula-
tions were performed for the two PEC. As in the passive regenerator
simulations, the searches for the points of minimum entropy generation
were refined further using 4th-order (or less) polynomial interpolations
(R2 &gt; 0.9999) to guarantee the stability of the numerical solutions
and provide a better resolution (finer than 0.5 mm for Dh,Reg, 0.05
for ? and 0.01 mm for dp) for the minimum Sg value at a reasonable
computational cost.

7.3.2 Entropy Generation Cycle-Average Cooling
Capacity Contour Maps

As the numerical convergence is obtained for a specific set of simulated
parameters associated with a PEC, the AMR configurations that yield



7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 305

the desired value of Q?c can be identified. As illustrated previously in
the passive regenerators optimization, Fig. 7.12 presents the contour
maps for the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and
4 Hz. Fig. 7.13 shows the contour maps for the FA PEC with m? =
200 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and 4 Hz. Lines of constant Sg (red

lines) are plotted together with lines of constant Q?c (blue lines), as
a function of the particle diameter and housing diameter for the VG
PEC (Fig. 7.12) and particle diameter and housing aspect ratio for the
FA PEC (Fig. 7.13).

From Figs. 7.12 and 7.13, it can be seen that the target value of Q?c =
20 W per regenerator (blue solid line) can be achieved with different
combinations of dp and Dh,Reg or ?, with different frequencies and flow
rates for each PEC. For the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and f = 1 Hz,

Fig. 7.12(a), Q?c = 20 W per regenerator can be achieved with values of
dp between 0.5 and 1.4 mm and housing diameters between 12.5 and 50
mm, which correspond to values of ? between 0.25 and 16. In this case,

the minimum value of Sg that guarantees a value of Q?c = 20 W per
regenerator was found around dp = 1.2 mm and Dh,Reg = 20 mm. For
the 4 Hz operating frequency, Fig. 7.12(b), the minimum Sg is shifted
to larger values of dp, yielding other combination of Dh,Reg and ?.

For the FA PEC with m? = 200 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.13(a),

the minimum Sg for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator was identified in the
vicinity of dp = 1.1 mm, with an aspect ratio around 4. As expected,

for other frequencies the minimum Sg range changes and Q?c = 20 W
per regenerator is achieved with other combinations of dp and ?, as
presented in Fig. 7.13(b).

7.3.3 Variable Geometry (VG) Evaluation Criteria

7.3.3.1 Fixed Frequency

This section describes the results for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency
and variable mass flow rate. Performing the same evaluation presented
in Fig. 7.7 for passive regenerators, it is possible to find the optimal

combinations of dp, Dh,Reg and ? that guarantee a Q?c = 20 W per
regenerator at ?THex = 15 K. The results are shown in Fig. 7.14.
A summary of the conditions associated with the points of minimum
Sg is presented in Table 7.14, which also presents the values of the
utilization, ?, and the total demagnetization factor, ND,total (calculated
from Eq. (4.49)), which depends only on Dh,Reg and ? since the porosity
of the regenerator is constant. The individual contributions to the total
entropy at the minimum, Sg,min, due to interstitial heat transfer with
a finite temperature difference, Sg,HT, axial conduction in the solid,
Sg,SAC, axial conduction in the fluid, Sg,FAC, and viscous dissipation,
Sg,VD, are presented in Fig. 7.15.

Table 7.14 – Minimum Sg parameters for the VG PEC for Q?c = 20 W
per regenerator and ?THex = 15 K, at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz and
flow rates between 40 and 100 kg/h.

Before starting the analysis of the results, it is important to remember

how Q?c is defined:

Q?c = m?cp,f(TC ?T CE) (7.10)

where m? is the average mass flow rate and T CE is the average tempera-
ture of the fluid exiting the regenerator at the cold end. Also, TC?T CE
is the temperature difference at the cold reservoir, ?Tc.

An evaluation of the results in Figs. 7.14 and 7.15 and Table 7.14 re-
veals that for the smallest mass flow rate, m? = 40 kg/h, to achieve

the performance constraint of Q?c = 20 W per regenerator, a larger
?Tc is necessary, which is associated with a lower average temperature
T CE (the reservoir temperature is fixed). To achieve a lower T CE a
higher ?-NTU matrix is necessary, which is guaranteed by the small-
est utilization, smaller particle size (compared with 50-70 kg/h) and
a longer matrix with a smaller Dh,Reg, corresponding to higher super-
ficial velocities. This optimum scenario is confirmed by the smallest
absolute value of Sg,HT, meaning a high effectiveness heat transfer.
However, the use of a smaller particle size increased slightly the penal-
ties associated with the viscous dissipation.

As the mass flow rate is increased up to 70 kg/h, the optimal region

shifts to bigger particle diameters, larger housing diameters and shorter
aspect ratios (see Table 7.14). Although the NTU is low, the small
absolute values of utilization still result in a high effectiveness and a
large ?Tc, which when multiplied by the low flow rate guarantees the
20-W constraint. This trend persists until a minimum NTU is found
for m? = 70 kg/h.

For mass flow rates higher than 70 kg/h, lower values of ?Tc are suf-
ficient to guarantee the 20-W constraint. However, the increase of the
utilization needs to be compensated with a larger NTU in order to
achieve the 15 K of span. Hence, the optimal conditions involve small
particle diameters, large housing diameters and small values of aspect
ratio. Since at high mass flow rates and small particle diameters the vis-
cous losses become more important, a big housing diameter is required
to decrease the superficial velocity, which results in shorter matrices.



312 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators

Nevertheless, smaller particle diameters are necessary to enhance the
interstitial heat transfer, increasing NTU and decreasing Sg,HT (in %).
However, as the regenerator effectiveness decreases with the increas-
ing utilization, the absolute value of Sg,HT increases with m?. With
shorter matrices, the axial conduction contributions (Sg,FAC) become
more important (in %) since the spheres size becomes smaller and the
superficial velocity decreases. Sg,VD, also increases with the mass flow
rate and the decreasing on the particle size. The contribution of Sg,SAC
is small, around 1%.

Regarding the demagnetization factor, for a constant temperature dif-
ference between the thermal reservoirs, a bigger ND,total means a smaller
effective magnetic field, Heff, (Eq. (4.47)) and a smaller ?Tad. To com-
pensate the reduction of the MCE, a higher effectiveness regenerator
is required. However, for the cases evaluated here, the variations in
ND,total were little and, for the relatively small temperature difference
of 15 K used as a constraint, these effects were of secondary importance
to the MCE when the different optimum dimensions were compared.

It has been shown in this section that the optimal configurations for
f = 1 Hz and several mass flow rates are related to small housing
diameters (between 18 and 25 mm). Thus, the magnetic circuit size
can be estimated considering a permanent magnet built in a Halbach
cylinder array, for which the magnetic flux density, B, inside the bore
of an infinite cylinder is given by (BJØRK et al., 2008):

B = Brem ln

(
De
Di

)
(7.11)

where Brem is the remanence of the magnet grade, De is the external
and Di the internal diameters of the cylinder. Considering B = 1.5
T, Brem = 1.4 T for a Nd2Fe14B magnet grade (BAKKER-MAGNETICS,
2014), Di = Dh,Reg and Lmag = LReg = ?Dh,Reg, the optimum regen-
erator dimensions for each flow rate lead to the ideal Halbach cylinder
dimensions presented in Table 7.15.

The results show that the smaller mass flow rates require smaller di-
ameters and longer magnets, while the higher flow rates are related to
bigger diameters and shorter magnets. However, the total volume of
permanent magnet necessary to create a flux density of 1.5 T in the
bore of the Halbach cylinder is about the same for all cases. Therefore,

in terms of the minimum entropy generated (less irreversibility), using
the smallest mass flow rate possible is recommended since it achieves
the performance constraint with a more efficient AMR design.

7.3.3.2 Fixed Mass Flow Rate

The results for the VG PEC at a fixed mass flow of 60 kg/h rate and
variable frequencies, between 1 and 4 Hz, are presented as a function of

changes in Dh,Reg, ? and dp for a constant Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at
?THex = 15 K, as illustrated in Fig. 7.16. A summary of the conditions
that lead to the minimum Sg results is presented in Table 7.7 and the
individual contributions to the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min,
are shown in Fig. 7.17.

and variable frequencies in the range of 1-4 Hz: (a) Sg as a function of
dp; (b) Sg as a function of Dh,Reg; (c) Sg as a function of ?.

In this scenario, with a fixed mass flow rate, ?Tc is also constant in

order to achieve the performance constraint of Q?c = 20 W per regenera-
tor. As a result, the regenerator effectiveness is approximately constant
and the output parameters vary according to the frequency/utilization.
Regarding ND,total, the results show that it is also approximately con-
stant. The results in Figs. 7.16 and 7.17 and Table 7.16 show that for
f = 1.0 Hz the optimal region involves comparatively smaller parti-
cle diameters, meaning a larger NTU for a higher utilization. Hence,
larger housing diameters and shorter matrices are needed to decrease
the superficial velocity and reduce the viscous losses, which leads to a
more significant axial conduction contribution to Sg,min.

By increasing the frequency and reducing the utilization, the heat trans-
fer is enhanced, which decreases the absolute values of Sg,HT, as seen in

Fig. 7.17. Also, the individual contributions of axial heat conduction
and viscous dissipation at the minimum are reduced. As seen in Table
7.16, the longer matrices cause reductions in Sg,FAC and Sg,SAC, and
bigger particle diameters are responsible for the reduction in Sg,VD.

The optimum values encountered for Dh,Reg, ? and dp did not present
significant variations with the frequency, and, as a result, the variation
in the NTU was also small. As seen in Fig. 7.17, the contributions of
Sg,SAC are almost negligible, while Sg,HT dominates the total Sg,min. In
conclusion, the operation of an AMR at a higher frequency reduces the
level of irreversibility in the AMR, as Sg,min decreases with frequency.
The optimized points at m? = 60 kg/h and f between 1 and 4 Hz are
associated with small housing diameters, around 19 mm, and aspect
ratios of approximately 4.5. Regarding the magnetic circuit size, as in
the previous case (fixed mass flow rate), all of the optimized conditions
had virtually the same total volume of permanent magnet to generate

7.3.4 Fixed Face Area (FA) Evaluation Criteria

7.3.4.1 Fixed Frequency

This section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed frequency
of 1 Hz and variable mass flow rate, between 50 and 200 kg/h, as a
function of ? and dp. As mentioned previously, Dh,Reg is constant and
kept fixed at 25 mm. Again, the results are illustrated for a target

Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at ?THex = 15 K. The FA PEC is further
explored in Fig. 7.18, which shows Sg as a function of dp and ?. Table
7.17 summarizes the parameters associated with the optimal conditions
for each mass flow rate. Fig. 7.10 shows the individual contributions to
the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min.

the particle diameter and aspect ratio. The values in Table 7.17 refer
to the minimum value found (at the end of the interval). Thus, the m?
= 50 kg/h condition is not included in following analysis.

Figure 7.19 – Individual contributions to the total entropy at the min-

imum, Sg,min, for the FA PEC for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at
?THex = 15 K, fixed frequency of 1 Hz and variable mass flow rates in
the range of 50-200 kg/h.

For m? = 75 kg/h, the minimum Sg is associated with the smallest
particle diameter, that corresponds to a large heat transfer area. Such
a high ?-NTU matrix is required to achieve the cooling capacity target
by increasing ?Tc, which results in comparatively small value of Sg,HT
(see Fig. 7.19). However, a shorter matrix is necessary to cut the viscous
dissipation contribution, but ends up increasing the penalties associated
with the axial heat conduction. In this case, the Sg,HT, Sg,VD and
Sg,FAC have around the same weight (in % and absolute values) to the
total Sg.

Increasing the mass flow rate, the minimum Sg is shifted to bigger par-
ticle diameters and longer matrices. As the mass flow rate is increased,
?Tc becomes smaller, and less effective matrices are necessary, which
raises Sg,HT. Therefore, the use of bigger particle sizes compensates
the increasing superficial velocities and the effect of longer matrices
on the viscous dissipation contribution, which increases in terms of its



320 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators

absolute value but not in relative terms (%). Longer matrices help to
reduce the impact of the axial conduction. The increase of ND,total is
also small for the optimized dimensions.

As in the passive regenerator optimization for the FA PEC at a fixed
frequency, Sg,HT and Sg,VD are the main contributions (in %) to the to-
tal entropy generation. As the mass flow rate increases, NTU decreases
and ? increases, making the heat transfer less effective (higher Sg,HT)
and, even though the particle diameter that minimizes the entropy
generation increases, the viscous dissipation becomes more important.
Also, the Sg,FAC and Sg,SAC contributions were found to be significant
at lower mass flow rates, i.e., lower superficial velocities and shorter
matrices.

Regarding the optimum regenerator and magnet dimensions, an ex-
ternal diameter De = 73 mm was encountered for the ideal Halbach
cylinder. Obviously, the amount of magnet material required to gener-
ate the 1.5 T flux density change increases linearly with the optimized
regenerator length. In this case, in terms of the total minimum entropy
generated, using the lowest mass flow rate possible means a more ef-
ficient AMR design, which coincides with the smallest ideal magnetic
circuit size (short Halbach cylinders).

7.3.4.2 Fixed Mass Flow Rate

This section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed mass flow
rate of 200 kg/h and variable frequency between 1 and 4 Hz. Again,

the results are illustrated for a target Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at
?THex = 15 K. Fig. 7.20 shows the behavior of Sg as a function of
dp and ?. Table 7.18 summarizes the optimal parameters for each
frequency. Fig. 7.21 presents the individual contributions to the total
entropy at the minimum, Sg,min.

As in the VG PEC, for a constant mass flow rate, the ?Tc that satisfies

the performance constraint of Q?c = 20 W per regenerator is also fixed.
Hence, in the FA PEC for a constant mass flow rate, the effectiveness
changes only a little to compensate the small variations of ND,total and,
thus, minor differences in the utilization factor and NTU are observed
when compared with the FA PEC to a constant frequency.

For f = 4 Hz, the minimum Sg configuration is out of the range of the
particle diameter and aspect ratio. The values in Table 7.18 refer to



7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 321

Table 7.18 – Minimum Sg parameters for the FA PEC for Q?c = 20 W

the minimum value found (at the end of the interval). Thus, this case
was not included in the analysis.

Since ? is approximately constant, this AMR optimization scenario is
quite similar to the passive regenerator optimization. For f = 1 Hz,
the minimum Sg was found for a big particle diameter and a large as-
pect ratio, while for f = 3.5 Hz, the minimum Sg was characterized
by a small particle size and a short matrix length. As the frequency
is increased, the utilization factor decreases due to the shorter blow
period. Nevertheless, the matrix length also decreases, reducing the
thermal mass of the solid phase and the total interstitial area. Conse-
quently, the utilization factor and the NTU did not present significant
variations with frequency, resulting in a nearly constant contribution
(in %) of Sg,HT to Sg,min, as can be seen in Fig. 7.21. At low frequen-
cies Sg,VD was large even for bigger particle diameters due to the large
value of the matrix length. On the other hand, higher frequencies can
sustain shorter matrix lengths and smaller particle diameters, but this
increases (in %) the penalty associated with axial heat conduction in
the fluid, Sg,FAC. Sg,SAC presented a minor contribution to Sg,min.

In the present scenario, the total minimum entropy generation was
observed at the higher operating frequencies. As in the FA PEC for
a fixed frequency and variable mass flow rate, the more efficient AMR
design dimensions, found at the higher frequencies, require the smallest
ideal magnetic circuit size due to their shorter aspect ratios.

8 Final Considerations

The work presented in this thesis dealt with the experimental and nu-
merical evaluation of the fluid flow, heat transfer and thermo-magnetic
phenomena in thermal regenerators for magnetic cooling applications
around room temperature. As proposed initially, an experimental ap-
paratus was designed and built, as well an 1D transient numerical model
was developed to accomplish the objectives of this work. Also, different
porous media matrices were used as thermal regenerators. Information
regarding the heat transfer effectiveness, viscous, thermal and magnetic
losses, and performance as a cooling system were evaluated by means
of the experimental and numerical approaches.

The passive regenerator study was fundamental to understand the heat
transfer and viscous losses in regenerative matrices using a liquid as a
heat transfer agent. Firstly, the experience gained along the experimen-
tal testing of the passive regenerators related to the instrumentation
and regression of the experimental data was crucial for the develop-
ment of a robust experimental procedure to evaluate the performance
of passive and magnetic regenerators.

By using different sizes of spheres and different regenerator casing di-
mensions it was possible to verify the sensitivity of the experimental
and numerical results when operating parameters were changed, e.g.,
operating frequency and utilization factor. The results for packed beds
of spheres corroborated the expectation that small particle diameter
spheres guarantee the highest thermal effectivenesses, at the expense
of higher viscous losses. In terms of the casing dimensions, matrices
with bigger aspect ratios have a high effectiveness as found for Casings
#3 and #4. However, for Casing #4 (smaller cross sectional area and
higher superficial velocities), the penalties associated with the viscous
losses were more pronounced. On the other hand, for a fixed cross sec-
tional area (Casings #1, #2 and #3), higher effectivenesses were found



326 8 Final Considerations

for the regenerators with larger thermal mass. Nevertheless, the results
showed that the improvement of the effectiveness by increasing the re-
generator aspect ratio was little when compared with the increasing of
the viscous losses.

Comparing different matrix geometries, the results showed that, in
terms of the thermal effectiveness, the geometries behaved were very
similarly, with the pin arrays presenting a better performance at low
utilization and the packed beds performing better at high utilizations.
The parallel plate geometry presented a more limited performance be-
cause of the axial heat conduction and approximately constant inter-
stitial heat transfer coefficient.

In addition, the results showed that a good regenerator design also
has to take into account an optimum balance between the void volume
size and the inlet flow distribution in the regenerative matrix. As a
recommendation, the void volume has to be as smaller as possible,
without restricting the fluid flow at the entrance region. This way,
square and round regenerator cross sectional areas are less susceptible
to maldistribution effects on the fluid flow.

The numerical model, including the void volume modeling, was success-
fully implemented and was capable of reproducing the experimental re-
sults for all the operating conditions. The model was able to reproduce
with good precision the variation on the inlet fluid stream temperature
due to the void volumes, and captured the axial heat conduction in
situations where the diffusion heat transfer is on the same order as the
advection heat transfer.

With respect to the thermodynamic performance of active regenera-
tors, the results for Spheres #3 exposed one of the main limitations of
state of the art in AMR research, namely the inability to achieve high
cooling capacities together with large temperature spans between the
reservoirs. For regenerators composed by Gd spheres, the second-law
efficiency was maximum for 15 and 20-K temperature spans.

Comparing different matrix geometries, the results showed a similar
performance for the pin arrays and spheres packed beds in terms of
the cooling capacity and coefficient of performance. While the spheres
bed had a higher cooling capacity due to a higher thermal effectiveness,
especially at high utilizations, the pins had a higher COP because of
the lower viscous losses. Again, the parallel plate geometry presented
several limitations due to the approximately interstitial constant heat



8.1 Recommendations to Future Works 327

transfer coefficient and possibly due to a higher heat gain through the
regenerator casing. In this scenario, if manufacturing limitations are
considered, the spheres packed beds are certainly the most promising
geometry for applications in AMR coolers.

The AMR numerical model, including the different external losses, i.e.,
casing heat gain, magnetic field axial profile and void volume, was capa-
ble of reproducing the experimental data with good precision. There-
fore, the satisfactory performance of the methodology in simulating
passive and active regenerators, demonstrated that the 1D approach
can be used as a tool to design optimum regenerators.

This way, a robust methodology combining the Entropy Generation
Minimization and the Performance Evaluation Criteria (PEC) was pro-
posed. The variable geometry (VG) and fixed face area (FA) PEC were
implemented aiming at optimizing passive regenerators for a target ef-
fectiveness of 95%, and AMRs for a target condition of 20-W cooling
capacity at 15-K temperature span. The results presented optimum
combinations of casing diameter, aspect ratio and sphere diameter, for
specified values of mass flow rate and operating frequency.

The study indicated possible directions for the AMR performance, such
as: (i) the optimization of the casing dimensions and matrix geometry
to reduce the penalties associated with heat transfer and viscous dis-
sipation; (ii) the optimization of the regenerator cross sectional area
with respect to the reduction of the regenerative mass at the expense
of a better thermal insulation.

8.1 Recommendations to Future Works

Based on the advances presented in this thesis some important recom-
mendations for future works can be listed as follows:

1. Replace the double effect pump by a rotary valve system and
perform experimental tests using the same operating conditions
as presented for the Spheres #3 regenerator. This will allow
comparisons between the different pumping systems in terms of
the AMR performance;

2. Use different rotary valve gaskets to evaluate experimentally the
synchronization of the magnetic and fluid flow profiles in order to



328 8 Final Considerations

find the best operating condition of the AMR;

3. Validate the numerical model in terms of the synchronization of
the magnetic and fluid flow profiles and perform the optimization
of the fluid flow periods;

4. Expand the magnetocaloric materials properties library and im-
plement a multi-layer regenerator routine in the numerical model
to evaluate the performance improvement reported in the litera-
ture;

5. Perform experimental tests with different magnetocaloric materi-
als, assembling the new materials in a multi-layer configuration;

6. Validate the numerical model with respect to the multi-layer ex-
perimental tests;

7. Use the optimization expertise to optimize the multi-layer con-
figuration in terms of the Curie Temperature and the length of
each layer;

8. Include in the EGM model the entropy generated by the heat
transfer through the regenerator casing. This modified model,
associated with the PECs, will allow the optimization between the
reduction of the regenerator cross sectional area at the expense
of improving the thermal insulation;

9. Evaluate the applicability of lumped models to describe the heat
transfer in the casing region, given that such models are less com-
putationally demanding.

APPENDIX A

Nested Halbach Cylinder Design

The present appendix shows the optimization routine proposed to de-
sign optimum Nested Halbach Cylinders (NHC) magnetic circuits as
proposed by Trevizoli et al. (2015).

A.1 Modeling

A.1.1 Analytical Modeling

A.1.1.1 Basic Equations

In the analytical model of the NHC configuration, the magnetic flux
density generated at the core of each cylinder is evaluated indepen-
dently. The fundamental expression to quantify the magnetic flux den-
sity at the center of a finite length non-segmented Halbach cylinder,
Bfin, is given by (BJØRK et al., 2010d; COEY, 2002):

where Brem is the magnitude of the remanent flux density of the per-
manent magnet, L is the length of the Halbach cylinder, and De and
Di are the external and internal diameters of the cylinder, respec-
tively. In Eq. (A.1), it follows that if L ? ?, then Bfin ? Binf =
Brem ln(De/Di), where Binf is the magnetic flux density at the center
of an infinite non-segmented Halbach cylinder.

Due to fabrication restrictions, the magnet cylinder has to be divided
into n segments with specific remanent flux density orientations (see
Fig. 3.6 for an example of an 8-segment NHC). The magnetic flux
density at the center of a finite length Halbach cylinder with n segments
is given by (COEY, 2002; BJØRK et al., 2008):

BHC = Bfin

[
sin(2?/n)

(2?/n)

]
(A.2)

where n is the number of segments. Naturally, if n ? ? and the
remanent flux density changes continuously for each segment, then
BHC ? Bfin (BJØRK et al., 2008). Therefore, in the design procedure,
the analytical expression given by Eq. (A.2) is used to calculate the
magnetic flux densities at the center of the external (BHC,E) and inter-
nal (BHC,I) cylinders.

A.1.1.2 Parameters and Constraints

The magnetic circuit is designed in accordance with the regenerator
dimensions. Parameters such as the regenerator diameter, length and
mass have a direct effect on the magnetic field intensities and field
volume. The following input parameters are required in the proposed



A.1 Modeling 349

design procedure:

? The inner diameter of the internal magnet, Di,I, which is directly
related to the regenerator housing diameter;

? The air gap between the magnet arrays, `gap. This parameter
determines the inner diameter of the external magnet, Di,E. The
smaller the air gap the higher the magnetic field intensity at the
NHC core. However, as pointed out by Arnold et al. (2014), small
air gaps intensify the interaction between the fringing fields of
the internal and external magnets, increasing the torque needed
to rotate the system;

? Number of Halbach segments, n. Tura and Rowe (2011) com-
pared a 16-segment NHC with an 8-segment NHC and observed
a reduction of about 7% in the maximum magnetic flux density.
Manufacturing costs have to be considered in the selection of this
parameter;

? Magnet grade. This determines the remanent flux density, Brem,
and intrinsic coercivity, Hcj, of each magnet. While Brem is di-
rectly proportional to the resultant magnetic flux density, Eq.
(A.2), Hcj controls the operating stability of the NHC. As will be
seen, the internal Halbach cylinder must be manufactured with a
high coercivity magnet grade (small Brem), to avoid magnetiza-
tion reversal.

To determine the outer diameter of the inner magnet, De,I, Bjørk (2011)
derived an ideal ratio between the outer and inner diameters of an
infinite non-segmented Halbach cylinder, De,I/Di,I, of 2.219. In the
present analysis, the range of values to find De,I was set around this
optimum as follows:

2.15 ?
De,I
Di,I

? 2.25 (A.3)

The inner diameter of the external magnet, Di,E, is calculated by simply
adding the air gap, `gap:

Di,E = De,I + 2`gap (A.4)



350 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design

To determine the outer diameter of the external magnet, De,E, Bjørk
et al. (2010a) proposed the following design relationship for NHCs:

0.8 ?
De,I/Di,I
De,E/Di,E

? 1 (A.5)

At this point, in the present method, the diameters of the internal and
external magnets are known, but the lengths of the magnet cylinders
are not. In the interest of weight, cost and manufacturability, Tura and
Rowe (2011) suggest that the ratio of the external diameter and the
length of the external cylinder, De,E/LE should be close to unity. This
leads to the following design constraint:

0.8 ?
De,E
LE

? 1.2 (A.6)

In order to minimize the stray field gradient out of the magnet and, at
the same time, maintain a high average magnetic flux density at the
maximum position (see Fig. 3.7), the following constraint has been used
to determine the length of the internal magnet (BJØRK et al., 2010a):

0.8 ?
LI
LE
? 1 (A.7)

A.1.1.3 Design Procedure

In the NHC design procedure, the parameter ranges given by Eqs. (A.3),
(A.5), (A.6) and (A.7) are divided into 21 increments each, resulting in
214 = 194,481 possible magnet configurations. For a set of input pa-
rameters, namely, Di,I, `gap, n and magnet grade, Eq. (A.2) is applied
to calculate the magnetic flux densities at the centers of the external
and internal cylinders, BHC,E and BHC,I, for each possible magnet con-
figuration. Then, the maximum and minimum magnetic flux densities
for the nested configuration, Bmax and Bmin, are simply calculated by:

Bmax = BHC,E + BHC,I (A.8)

Bmin = |BHC,E ?BHC,I| (A.9)



A.1 Modeling 351

Bjørk et al. (2010b) proposed the following figure of merit to charac-
terize permanent magnet designs for magnetic refrigeration,

?cool =
(
?Bhigh?2/3 ??Blow?2/3

) ?Field
?Magnet

?? (A.10)

where ?Bhigh? is the volumetric average high magnetic flux density,
?Blow? is the volumetric average low magnetic flux density, ?Field is the
total volume where the magnetic field is applied, ?Magnet is the volume
of permanent magnet raw material, for instance, Nd2Fe14B, and ?

? is
the fraction of the cycle period during which the magnet is used. ?cool
quantifies the potential of a magnetic circuit for magnetic refrigeration
applications. An ideal magnet for an AMR prototype should guarantee
a high magnetic field variation (higher magnetocaloric effect), a large
volume of generated magnetic field (larger density of magnetocaloric
material), must be used during most of the cycle time (ideally in a con-
tinuous cycle) and, equally important, use a small amount of permanent
magnet (to reduce cost).

The ?cool figure of merit, Eq. (A.10), is calculated for each NHC config-
uration and used as the main parameter to determine the optimal NHC
dimensions, i.e., those which result in the highest magnetic flux density
variation for the lowest possible amount of raw magnet material. How-
ever, the analytical model gives the magnetic flux density at a single
point (the center of the magnets), which is assumed to be close to the
volume average. The magnetic field volume, ?Field, is calculated con-
sidering the internal magnet diameter and the regenerator maximum
length, since this is the useful volume of magnetic field. The fraction
of the cycle period, ??, was assumed equal to 0.5, which is typical of
NHC arrays (BJØRK et al., 2010c).

Additional constraints were adopted to rule out poor performance con-
figurations and select the candidates with more desirable characteris-
tics. These are as follows:

1. µ0Hmin &amp;lt;0.1 T, or as close as possible to 0 T (BJØRK et al.,
2010d);

2. ?cool ? 0.025, since ?cool ? 0.03 was reported by Bjørk et al.
(2010c) for typical NHC configurations.



352 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design

A.1.2 COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling

The optimal NHC configuration designed according to the analyti-
cal procedure was numerically simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics
(v. 4.2, AC/DC Module, Magnetic Fields, No Currents formulation).
The magnetostatic formulation, where the electric currents are neg-
ligible, is modeled using the magnetic scalar potential (Vm) defined

as ~H = ??Vm. Substituting the constitutive relation for permanent
magnets ( ~B = µ0µr ~H + ~Brem) into the Gauss’s law for magnetism

(?· ~B = 0), and by employing the magnetic scalar potential, the model
becomes ??· (µ0µr?Vm ? ~Brem) = 0 (COMSOL. . . , 2011).

3-D simulations were performed to compute the magnetic flux density
profile along the axial z-direction, including the center of the magnet.
As will be discussed later, the analytical model corrects ~B at the center
of the magnet for finite length effects according to Eq. (A.1), but does
not calculate the axial magnetic flux density profile and how this profile
is influenced by end effects, which are crucial to the determination of
the final length of the internal array. The 3-D simulations were carried
out using a mesh of about 1.63 million tetrahedral elements with an
average element quality of 0.835. A conjugated gradient solver was
employed with a convergence tolerance of 10?6.

2-D simulations were carried out to evaluate the magnetization rever-
sal in the external and internal arrays and the energy product, BH, of
the permanent magnets. The 2D simulations used a mesh with 87443
quadrilateral elements with an average element quality of 0.985. The
input parameters in the 2-D and 3-D simulations were the magnet re-
manent flux density and the magnet relative permeability, µr, which
was set to 1.05.

A.2 Experimental Analysis

The optimal NHC array was manufactured (Bakker Magnetics B.V.)
and experimental measurements were performed to validate the design
procedure and characterize the main parameters of the magnetic cir-
cuit. Magnetic flux density measurements were carried out using a
LakeShore 425 model gaussmeter coupled to a transverse probe (model
HMMT-6J04-VF). Using a purpose-built 3-D Cartesian probe travers-
ing system, the probe was positioned at the center line of the magnet,



A.3 Results and Discussions 353

x = y = 0 (see Fig. A.1), and traversed from one end of the mag-
net structure to the other along the center line. At each z-position,
the NHC was rotated at a frequency of 0.25 Hz and the instantaneous
magnetic flux density was acquired at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. The
experimental uncertainty of the magnetic flux density was evaluated
at 1% of the measured value. As illustrated in Fig. A.1, both the x
and y-components of the magnetic flux density vector were measured,
which enabled the evaluation of both the magnitude and direction of
~B.

(a) (b)

Figure A.1 – Illustration of the probe position to measure magnetic
flux density components: (a) Measurement of the Bx component. (b)
Measurement of the By component.

Torque measurements were carried out using a torque transducer (HBM
model T22) with a full-scale reading of 20 N m. Time dependent torque
measurements were performed at variable magnet operating frequen-
cies, f, between 0.25 Hz and 1.5 Hz. The sampling rate was changed
from 75 Hz (at f = 0.25 Hz) to 450 Hz (at f = 1.5 Hz) so as to measure
300 experimental data points per cycle. The experimental uncertainty
of the torque was estimated at 0.6% of the measured value.

A.3 Results and Discussions

A.3.1 Design Procedure Results

A basic prerequisite of the NHC array is that a high magnetic field
intensity must be generated along the entire regenerator length. In
the present AMR test device, the maximum regenerator length was
set at 100 mm. Therefore, the NHC array must be longer than the



354 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design

regenerator to minimize the influence of magnet end effects on the
regenerator performance. The other design input parameters are as
follows:

? Di,I = 27.0 mm, which is enough to accommodate a 25.4-mm
OD G10 fiberglass tube used as the regenerator housing;

? `gap = 3.0 mm, following the recommendations of Arnold et al.
(2014);

? n = 8 magnet segments to balance cost and performance.

The Nd2Fe14B sintered magnet grade properties selected for the
internal and external magnets are presented in Table A.1
(BAKKER-MAGNETICS, 2014). The choice of two different magnet grades
for the inner and outer magnets was based on experience gained through
numerical analysis using COMSOL. Although grades with a higher re-
manence (which are associated with lower coercivities) resulted higher
magnetic flux densities, they were more prone to magnetization rever-
sal. After trying a few grade combinations, it was verified that the one
presented in Table 1 did not reverse the magnetization and imposed a
small penalty on the magnetic flux density at the maximum position.

MAGNETICS, 2014).

The minimum value of the remanent flux density presented

The value of Hcj at 293 K was chosen since the application

is at near room temperature conditions.

Application of the design procedure with the above parameters and
conditions resulted in a number of possible dimensions for the NHC
array that satisfied the minimum magnetic flux density and the ?cool
constraints. The selected configuration also satisfied compactness cri-
teria of maximum dimensions for De,E and LE of 140.0 mm and 130.0
mm, respectively. Rounding up the values for manufacture simplicity,

the same input parameters, magnet grade properties and dimensions
obtained from the analytical model.

As can be seen, the results obtained with the 3D numerical model (COM-
SOL. . . , 2011) tend to be more conservative, but a very good agreement
is observed between the analytical design procedure and the 3D COM-
SOL results. This indicates that the analytical method can be used to
design NHC arrays.

Fig. A.2 illustrates the magnetic flux density in the x-y plane at the
center of the magnet array (z = 0). Both the maximum, Fig. A.2(a),
and the minimum, Fig. A.2(b), magnetic flux densities are homoge-
neously distributed in the magnet core. This is an important result
from the point of view of the validity of the analytical model, which is
concerned only with the flux density at the center point of the magnet

A.3 Results and Discussions 357

The analytical design procedure indicates that any value of internal
magnet length in the range 100 ? LI ? 130 mm satisfies the constraints
imposed on ?cool and does not generate significant deviations in the
maximum and minimum magnetic flux densities, as shown in Table
A.5. To demonstrate that LI = 115 mm is a suitable length, 3-D
COMSOL simulations were performed and the magnetic flux density
along the axial direction was evaluated for three different values of LI.
The results are presented in Fig. A.3 and in Table A.5. It should be
noted that in Fig. A.3 the magnetic flux density is plotted along the
length of the regenerator only, i.e., 100 mm. The following remarks can
be made regarding the internal magnet length selection:

1. LI = 100 mm. The internal magnet and the regenerator have
the same length. As seen in Fig. A.3, as the edge of the magnet
is approached, a significant reduction of Bmax is observed. This
reduces the z-averaged maximum magnetic field applied on the
regenerator in comparison with the other magnet lengths;

2. LI = 130 mm. This length gives the smallest reduction of Bmax
close to the ends of the regenerator and, consequently, the highest
average magnetic field. However, it represents an increase of 30%
in the internal magnet volume, which increases the cost of the
system and slightly reduces ?cool;

3. LI = 115 mm. This length constitutes a good compromise in
terms of cost and performance. While end effects do not reduce
significantly the local and z-averaged values of Bmax when com-
pared to LI = 130 mm, this length actually represents a better
use of Nd2Fe14B because of the smaller amount of material and
higher ?cool.

A.3.2 Magnetization Reversal and Energy Product
(BH ) Analysis

Halbach cylinders can generate in their core fairly high magnetic flux
densities, ~B, of the order of 2.0 T. Nevertheless, ~B is mainly limited by
the intrinsic coercivity of the magnet grade, Hcj. Physically, once the

reverse component of the magnetic field, ~H, reaches a value higher than
Hcj, a localized reversal of the direction of the magnetization is created,
giving rise to an additional opposite internal field in the magnet. As a

An evaluation of the reverse field has been performed based on the 2-D
COMSOL simulation results, according to the following criterion:

(
µ0Hcj + µ0 ~H ·

~Brem

)
? 0 (A.11)

where Hcj and ~Brem are the magnetic grade properties (Table A.1)

and ~Brem follows the remanence orientation of each segment (Fig. 3.6)
(BJØRK et al., 2008). Thus, if the criterion imposed by Eq. (A.11) is
locally violated, then a localized reversal of the direction of the mag-
netization is possible. Fig. A.4 shows the results of a magnetization
reversal analysis of the NHC array considering the maximum and min-

imum magnetic flux densities positions (see Fig. 3.6).

According to Fig. A.4, neither at the maximum magnetic flux density
magnet position, Fig. A.4(a), nor at the minimum magnetic flux density
magnet position, Fig. A.4(b), a reversal field was verified in the selected
NHC array. The gray arrows indicate the orientation of the remanent
flux density of each segment. Hence, one can conclude that the present
NHC array will operate safely.

The energy product, BH, of the permanent magnet in the magnetic
circuit was evaluated by means of the 2-D COMSOL numerical simu-
lation as the norm product of the components of ~B and ~H parallel to
~Brem as follows (BJORK, 2010):

BH =

?????~B · ~Brem|~Brem|
?????
?????~H · ~Brem|~Brem|

????? (A.12)
The BH results of Eq. (A.12) are presented in Fig. A.5 to illustrate
quantitatively the performance of the magnet design and draw at-
tention to the regions where the use of Nd2Fe14B is less effective.
Figs. A.5(a) and A.5(b) present the energy product of the magnets at
the maximum and minimum magnetic flux density positions, respec-
tively. Table A.6 summarizes the BH product evaluated separately for
each magnet cylinder.

The external magnet operates with a high energy product most of the
time, particularly the segments with a remanent flux density parallel to
the x-axis, at the maximum magnetic field position. On the other hand,
the segments with a remanent flux density parallel to y-axis have a lower
average energy, and a reasonable area with low energy operation. One

possible improvement might be to replace some of these low energy
regions in the external cylinder by a soft magnetic material, i.e. iron,
which would save raw magnet material and help to concentrate the
magnetic flux lines.

Conversely, the internal magnet operates most of the time with a low
energy product, especially when the remanent flux densities of the seg-
ments are aligned with those in the external magnet. This constitutes
a considerable volume of Nd2Fe14B whose potential energy is not used
effectively. A more specific evaluation of the behavior of the BH prod-
uct of the internal magnet can be made based on Fig. A.6, which allows
the following remarks:

? For the segments in position S1 in Fig. A.6, the resulting mag-
netic field ~H (represented by gray arrows) has the same direction
of the remanent flux density (represented by the purple arrows).
This results in a magnetization of the permanent magnet in seg-
ments S1 due to the high magnetic field generated by the external
magnet array in the same direction of the remanent flux density
of the internal segment;

? For the segments in position S2, the resulting magnetic field
~H (gray arrows) has an opposite direction in relation to the re-
manent flux density (purple arrows). This results in a reversal
magnetic field in segments S2 (see Eq. (A.11)) which can lead to
a magnetization reversal if the intrinsic coercivity is not properly
selected.

It can be concluded that in the present NHC design, replacement of the
raw magnet material by soft magnetic material in the low energy region
of the internal magnet is not an option since the flux density generated
by the internal array is continuously added to and subtracted from
the flux density generated by the external array so as to achieve the



A.3 Results and Discussions 363

high and low magnetic flux densities in the core. Thus, the internal
magnet must operate at a low energy to allow the desired magnetic
field variation in a fixed volume region. This explains why ?cool is
comparatively low in this type of magnet system. Additionally, the
results for the magnetization reversal and the energy product (BH)
reinforce the idea that the magnet grade has to be carefully selected
for the NHC configuration.

A.3.3 Nested Halbach Cylinder Final Design

A photograph of the final NHC design built according to the dimensions
presented in Tab. A.2 is presented in Fig. A.7. As mentioned before,
despite the more complex bearing structure and motion system, the
counter rotating configuration was preferred. Moreover, this design
requires the motor to operate at lower angular velocities and higher
torques. Also, since one of the objectives of the AMR test apparatus
is to evaluate experimentally regenerative geometries, such as parallel
plates and staggered arrays of pins, a fixed direction of the magnetic
flux density vector guarantees structural stability of the regenerator
geometry. Fig. A.8 presents a y ? z cutaway view of the final magnet
design, showing the bearing structure designed for the counter rotation
of the magnets.

Fig. A.9 shows the NHC motion system. A stepper motor (Kalatec
Nema 34, model KML-HT34-487) coupled to a 15:1 reduction gearbox
is employed to achieve high torques. The stepper motor is controlled
by a driver (Applied Motion model ST10), which guarantees a precise
operating speed and frequency control. The torque transducer (HBM
model T22) is assembled between the reduction and spiral bevel gear-
boxes. The spiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-EA-III, 1:1) was found
to be a suitable and compact solution to counter rotate the magnets;
the torque imposed by the stepper motor is transmitted by the bevel
gears to two independent shafts that rotate in opposite directions. Two
sets of pulleys and belts are used to connect the spiral bevel gearbox
and the magnets.

A.3.4 Experimental Results

Fig. A.10 presents the experimental results of the magnetic flux density
along the center line (x = y = 0) of the NHC array (between z = 0 and
137.5 mm) as a function of the rotating angle of the internal cylinder.
It should be noted from Fig. 3.7(b) that in the counter rotating config-
uration the two cylinders are dephased by 180?, so the rotating angle
of the external cylinder has a negative sign. Figs. A.10(a) and (b) show
the results for the y- and x-components, respectively. The resultant of
the magnetic flux density vector and its direction (i.e., the angle ? of
the resultant with the vertical y axis) are shown in Figs. A.10(c) and
(d), respectively. The solid lines represent the measurement stations
inside the NHC array where the regenerator is located (?50 ? z ? 50
mm). The dotted lines correspond to stations outside the regenerator
region surrounded by the bearing structure (see Fig. A.8). Ideally, the
x-component should be equal to zero, and the resultant should be equal
to the y-component (? = 0).

A.3 Results and Discussions 369

As can be seen from Fig. A.10, in the regenerator region (solid lines),
the x-component is close to zero, which makes the resultant magnetic
flux density very close to the measured y-component. ? changes very
little in this region. On the other hand, outside the NHC array (z ?
137.5 mm), the x-component increases and the y-component decreases,
reducing the absolute magnetic flux density to around zero. This causes
? to increase, showing a residual magnetic flux density outside the
magnets.

Fig. A.11 shows the axial profiles of the maximum magnetic flux density
components (x and y), the resultant and the vector direction (?). The
dark gray region represents the external and internal cylinder arrays,
and the light gray region the stainless steel support structure. In the
regenerator region (?50 ? z ? 50 mm), the magnetic flux density is
higher than 1.3 T and ? is approximately 2.5?. As expected, ? does not
vary with the rotating angle. Outside the cylinder arrays, the magnetic
field decreases continuously to 0 T at z = 137.5 mm and the vector
magnetic flux density changes its direction between 7.5 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;45o.

A comparison between the analytical, 3-D COMSOL simulation and
the experimental results for the magnetic flux density is presented in
Table A.7. As can be seen, Bmax is over-predicted by approximately
3.0% by the numerical analysis and by approximately 5.5% by the ana-
lytical procedure, which can be applied to design NHC arrays for AMR
systems at a negligible computational cost. Equally negligible are the
differences in the predictions of ?cool.

along the z-axis. The agreement between the 3-D COMSOL numerical
model and the experimental data is very encouraging and seems to rein-
force the validity of the proposed analytical procedure to design NHC
arrays. The experimental z-averaged magnetic flux density over the
regenerator region was 1.61 T, which corresponds to an experimental
?cool based on averaged values of 0.023.

The results of torque measurements at different operating frequen-
cies are presented in Fig. A.13. The time dependent torque data
present characteristic oscillations which are due to magnet segmenta-
tion of the magnets, as discussed by other authors (ARNOLD et al., 2014;
MHI?OCHA?IN et al., 1999). When the angular frequency is increased, the
amplitude of the oscillation decreases due to the inertia of the magnets.
On the other hand, as seen in Fig. A.13(b), the average cycle torque
increases linearly with the operating frequency.

APPENDIX B

Assembly of the Regenerative

Matrices

B.1 Assembly of Packed Bed Matrices

The steps of the assembly of the packed bed matrices, presented in
Fig. B.1, were performed as follows:

1. A specified amount of spheres is weighted and the initial mass is
recorded;

2. A R-T adapter is mounted at the bottom of the regenerator
housing and the casing is held in place by a benchtop vise;

3. A stainless steel end screen, mesh 80, is inserted in the regen-
erator, on top of the R-T adapter. The screen holds the spheres
inside the housing and is carefully assembled so as to remain per-
pendicular to the center line of the casing. Otherwise, a different
bed length or volume is calculated, resulting in a wrong estimate
of the porosity;

4. From the initial amount of weighted spheres, small samples are
collected and carefully spilled into the regenerator housing;

5. Using a pestle, the spheres are compacted in the housing;

6. Steps (4) and (5) are repeated until the housing is filled up with
spheres;

7. When the packed spheres reach a thermocouple feed-through,
a temperature probe is inserted and positioned at the center of
the housing. The uncertainty related with the temperature probe
axial position was evaluated at 2 mm;

8. When the regenerator is completely filled, another stainless steel
end-screen is placed at the top end. Next, the temperature probes
TCE and THE are assembled and carefully positioned at the ends
of the matrix. The top R-T adapter is connected, sealing the
matrix.

9. Finally, the excess amount of spheres are weighted and the poros-
ity of the matrix is calculated based on the total mass of material
used and the volume of the matrix.

B.2 Assembly of Parallel-Plate and Pin Ar-
ray Matrices

The steps of the assembly of the parallel plate and pin array matrices
are presented in Fig. B.2. This procedure was used in both the stainless
steel and Gd matrices. The steps are described next:

1. The five pieces of parallel plates are aligned and 0.13-mm thick
polymer plates are inserted into the channels to guarantee their
alignment without obstruction – see Fig. B.3(a);

2. A similar procedure is carried out for the pin array. However, the
polymer plates are positioned at 45? to guarantee the alignment
of the pieces – see Fig. B.3(b);

3. After the alignment, the pieces are glued (using an epoxy glue)
on a polymer sheet;

4. And a steel weight is carefully placed on top of the assembly to
guarantee a good contact with the polymer sheet;

5. This procedure is repeated for all the sides of the matrix, until
the five pieces are securely combined into a single matrix;

6. The regenerator matrix is inserted into the ABS housing;

7. The regenerator is glued (using an epoxy glue) to the ABS hous-
ing. This is important to avoid flow channeling between the re-
generator geometry and the ABS housing;

8. The ABS housing is cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, and assem-
bled into the G10 casing. This process was designed with a tight
tolerance between the external ABS diameter and the internal
G10 diameter to avoid flow channeling/leakage;

9. Finally, the temperature probes and the R-T adapters are con-
nected.

APPENDIX C

Nusselt Number Correlation for

Packed Beds of Spheres

The interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient for a packed bed
of spheres used in the present thesis was calculated using the Nusselt
number correlation of (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). This correlation was
preferred to more traditional ones (WHITAKER, 1972; WAKAO; KAGUEI,
1982), because it is valid for porosities between 0.2 and 0.9 and for a
wide range of Prandtl numbers (KUWAHARA et al., 2001). The results
discussed along the thesis are such that the particle Reynolds num-
bers lie between 1 and 500, which for water (Pr ? 6) correspond to
(Re0.6dp Pr

1/3)2 between 2 and 6 ×103. However, the majority of the data
in the present experimental data and simulations are for Redp &amp;lt;150, or
(Re0.6dp Pr

1/3)2 &amp;lt;1350, which is exactly the range where the Wakao and
Kaguei (1982) correlation exhibits the largest discrepancy with respect
to experimental data (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). Finally, comparing
Wakao and Kaguei (1982) and Pallares and Grau (2010) correlations
against the experimental data presented in this thesis, Pallares and
Grau (2010) exhibited a better reproduction of the experimental data,
as showed in Fig. C.1 that compares the experimental and numerical
results, using those Nusselt correlations, for the effectiveness as a func-
tion of the frequency to Casing#3 and two particle sizes, Fig. C.1(a)
dp = 0.5 mm and Fig. C.1(b) dp = 0.8 mm. Wakao and Kaguei (1982)
correlation, in general, underestimated the experimental values. The
same conclusion can be addressed to the other casings and particle sizes
presented in this thesis.
